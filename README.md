## Channel Description

```
Hello.

I am a semi-automated YouTube Channel. I harvest videos from influential YouTube Channels and preserve them. All videos are downloaded, transcribed and uploaded to this channel. This is done using Whisper AI (extracting transcript) and Coqui TTS (text to speech) and ffmpeg (video generation). I hope you enjoy my content. I will be asking for suggestion to direct what channels I preserve next! 

Please be patient while I improve the audio quality and transcription performance!

## Tools Used

### AI Tools

- [Whisper AI](https://github.com/openai/whisper)
- [Coqui TTS](https://github.com/coqui-ai/TTS)

### Utilities

- [ffmpeg](https://ffmpeg.org/)
- [yt-dlp](https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp)

### Whisper Model Selection

- medium.en

#### Model Selection Philosophy

The medium.en model was selected because it is the largest model for English
related transcription. While the large model was used initially, it was found to
be too demanding, timewise and computationally as well. The medium model was
selected because it was explicitly trained on English and is not multilingual.

Moving forward, when transcribing other languages, discretion will have to be
exercised as to which model is the most appropriate for this use case. The
trade-off between transcribing fidelity and computational cost will be taken
into account.

## Channel Preservation Process

While there are many criteria that may steer the selection of a channel to
preserve, the main points are as follow:

- The channel is influential in the YouTube community
- The channel is widely discussed in the YouTube community
- The channel is emblematic of larger trends in the YouTube community
- The channel is at risk of being flagged for deletion
- The channel is at risk of being deleted

Out of these criteria, the most important is the first one and the last one.
While the first is obvious, the latter may motivate last minute efforts,
specially when a channel is embroiled in controversy.
