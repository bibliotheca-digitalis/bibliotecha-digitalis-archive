# Actions

## Youtube

What follows is a more or less complete list of actions I did on Youtube. I am
adding this file because I realized not everything I do is captured in my github repo.

### Unlisted first two videos

The first two videos I uploaded were unlisted because I realized they didn't
really fit. I want to upload whole channels at a time, not just a few videos.
Also, I don't hav a solution for when the speaker in a video has an accent, like
Zizek unfortunately has. The videos are,

- Slavoj Zizek debates Jordan Peterson [HD, Clean Audio, Full]
- The Super Mario Bros. Movie (dunkview)

I will probably end up deleting them.

### Appending Channel name to title

From now on, I will append the channel name to the title of the video. Looking
at the videos, I did not like how the videos were the same as the original ones.
I try my best not to compete with the original channel. So, in addition to
providing additional information in from where the video is from, consider this
extra info that directly differentiates my videos from the original ones.

### Append [Audio Backup] to title

From now on, all videos will have [Audio Backup] appended to the title. This is
to further distinguish my videos from the original ones. Again, the whole is not
to compete with the original channel as much as possible.

### Two videos have been removed due to "misinformation"

Several days ago, two videos from the channel "potholer54" were removed due to
misformation. The videos concerned the COVID-19 pandemic. I have chosen not to
reupload them. The problems with this development is,

1. The videos explicitly argue against misinformation. The videos are not
   misinformation themselves but were apparently confused with the real thing.
2. The videos are already on Youtube. They were uploaded relatively recently.

I have chose not to fight this. I will not reupload the videos. If I encounter
more of this in the future, I will have to make a sort of change log for these videos.

## GitHub

## Removing

I rebased the repo and reuploaded the current repo to remove a reference to
personal identifying information. I do not plan on doing this often but the
project was at a immature stage where I could do so with little friction. I hope
to not do this again and promise to be more careful in the future.ter
