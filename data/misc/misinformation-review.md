# Video ' [Audio Backup] Stefan Molyneux's Native American Genocide - A Response | Shaun' has been removed due to "misinformation"

Dear YouTube Team,

I hope this message finds you well. I am writing to appeal the medical information strike that was recently applied to one of my videos, titled "Stefan Molyneux's Native American Genocide - A Response (Audio Version)." I believe that this strike was mistakenly given, as the content of my video is designed to combat misinformation rather than propagate it.

The video in question is a direct derivative (transcribed with Whisper AI then recreated using text-to-speech AI tech) of the audio version of an already published and well-received YouTube video by the user 'shaun'.

This is the third video flagged as misinformation. What is puzzling is how a
video arguing against misinformation can be flagged as such; also, the content
is already on youtube. How is this not allowed?
