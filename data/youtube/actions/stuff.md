# Actions I did on Youtube

What follows is a more or less complete list of actions I did on Youtube. I am
adding this file because I realized not everything I do is captured in my github repo.

## Unlisted first two videos

The first two videos I uploaded were unlisted because I realized they didn't
really fit. I want to upload whole channels at a time, not just a few videos.
Also, I don't hav a solution for when the speaker in a video has an accent, like
Zizek unfortunately has. The videos are,

- Slavoj Zizek debates Jordan Peterson [HD, Clean Audio, Full]
- The Super Mario Bros. Movie (dunkview)

I will probably end up deleting them.

## Appending Channel name to title

From now on, I will append the channel name to the title of the video. Looking
at the videos, I did not like how the videos were the same as the original ones.
I try my best not to compete with the original channel. So, in addition to
providing additional information in from where the video is from, consider this
extra info that directly differentiates my videos from the original ones.
