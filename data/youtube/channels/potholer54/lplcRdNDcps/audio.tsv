0	3280	In the first two videos we looked at the age of our universe
3280	7680	but how do we know the age of the earth and the ages of the rocks it contains?
7680	10960	Fortunately there are a number of different techniques
10960	15680	and they can all be checked against each other and they all tell us the same story.
15680	19280	Let's start with the benchmark, comparative dating.
19280	23440	The golden rule is that newer sedimentary deposits are always laid on
23440	23880	top of
23880	27240	older ones so except where rocks have been folded
27400	31240	this orange bed would be older than the green one and the green one is older
31240	32200	than the blue one.
32200	36320	Geologists can then follow a single bed to make similar deductions in a
36320	37560	different locality.
37560	40640	The dark grey bed may be at the surface
40640	44840	or even at a higher point than the others but it's older than all of them
44840	48800	and the light grey bed is older still. What we end up with
48800	53640	is what's called the geological column. To get the absolute dates of these rocks
53720	57680	scientists use a variety of different methods. I'll start with one of the
57680	59320	easiest and most recent.
59320	64080	We all know trees have rings because in summer they grow faster than in winter
64080	67640	but seasonal growing conditions vary according to the weather
67640	73320	so the bands will vary in size. Each time period in each geographical location
73320	77240	has its own distinctive pattern of tree rings like a fingerprint.
77240	81640	So if we take wood of a known age we can match the oldest part of it
81640	88640	with the youngest part of another piece of wood and so on back through time.
88640	93080	Our upper atmosphere is constantly being bombarded by neutrons from the Sun.
93080	97320	When one of them hits a nitrogen atom in the air it knocks off a proton
97320	102360	changing the atom from nitrogen into carbon. But this is a heavy and unstable
102360	104760	form of carbon called carbon 14
104760	107840	or C14. The normal form of carbon
107920	113840	is C12. In the atmosphere C14 combines with oxygen to make carbon dioxide
113840	117480	which is then absorbed by plants and into the bodies of
117480	122720	animals that eat the plants. The ratio of these two isotopes in animals and plants
122720	126200	is roughly the same as the ratio in the atmosphere around them.
126200	131240	But when the animal or plant dies C14 decays over time
131240	136200	and reverts back to nitrogen. So compared to C12 which doesn't change
136320	140520	the amount of C14 falls at a constant measurable rate.
140520	144200	By measuring this ratio inside the dead animal or plant
144200	149120	scientists can find out when it died. Before I look at other dating techniques
149120	152080	I'll bat a few hoary old myths about carbon 14
152080	155760	out of the ballpark. No it's not.
155760	159720	That's like saying cars don't work because sometimes drivers get lost.
159720	164040	Carbon dating works fine but if the wrong stuff gets analyzed then you'll
164040	165520	end up getting the wrong date.
165920	169880	So if there's bacteria or mold or any kind of contamination on the sample
169880	173800	the date will be wrong. If the results aren't calibrated properly
173800	177880	the results will be wrong. And in some environments carbon dating is
177880	178800	impractical
178800	182760	so the results will be wrong. But when everything's done properly
182760	187320	the results are right. That's no different to any sophisticated analysis
187320	188000	technique
188000	193120	from x-ray imaging to spectroscopy. Contaminated samples don't invalidate
193120	195000	the principle of DNA analysis
195080	198640	or chromatography or spectroscopy. We know they work
198640	203040	and we know carbon dating works. Firstly carbon dating can be checked against
203040	204680	artifacts of known age
204680	209280	such as ship's timber. Secondly it can be checked by sending the same artifact to
209280	211080	different labs for analysis.
211080	215720	Thirdly let's take a sample of organic material from each of these layers.
215720	219880	If carbon dating was random nonsense you'd expect the chronological
219880	224240	order of these samples to be all over the place but that doesn't happen.
224560	228440	The results show each of these samples in its correct chronological
228440	232680	order. The ones from the upper beds are younger and the ones from the lower beds
232680	233360	are older.
233360	237120	Is it magic or is it because carbon dating works
237120	240920	and that's why it's used?
240920	244640	Samples don't come with labels attached telling the lab their age.
244640	247800	Testing is always blind. If it's not blind
247800	252640	it's not science.
252640	256920	But carbon dating isn't used on diamonds and coal and for very good reason.
256920	261720	As I explained C14 is formed when neutrons collide with nitrogen atoms.
261720	265800	The C14 used in carbon dating originated in the atmosphere
265800	270640	but you can also get it deep underground in places where decaying uranium
270640	274600	is giving off neutrons. Coal and diamonds are made of carbon
274600	277760	so you'd expect to find higher levels of C14
277760	281280	in coal and diamonds close to rocks that contain uranium
281520	286800	and much lower levels away from those rocks. And that's exactly what we do find.
286800	290280	Carbon dating is only used and only useful
290280	293840	for dating organic material in the top most sedimentary layers.
293840	297600	Now that we've got carbon dating out of the way let's quickly run through a few
297600	298080	more
298080	303840	absolute dating methods. Biologists know that human DNA mutates at a fairly
303840	304840	regular rate
304840	309080	and they can trace these mutations back like following the branches of a tree
309080	313040	back to the trunk. It's not a greatly accurate method but it does give a rough
313040	315240	idea of when humans migrated
315240	320840	and a very definite idea of where.
320840	324000	Africa around 50,000 years ago just as
324000	329360	other dating methods suggested it should. Every 250,000 years or so
329360	333800	the Earth's magnetic fields flip over and the South Pole becomes the North Pole.
333800	338120	Magnetized minerals within rocks show the polarity of the Earth when the rocks
338120	339000	were laid down
339040	343640	so throughout the geological column rocks show a regular magnetic banding
343640	347320	depending on the polarity of the Earth and that can be dated.
347320	352080	Potassium-argon dating works on the same principle as carbon dating
352080	356240	but instead of carbon decaying to nitrogen we have potassium decaying to
356240	356840	argon
356840	360280	and instead of a half-life of 5,500 years
360280	363360	we have a half-life of 1.3 billion years.
363360	367360	That means the method can be used for dating rocks and fossils hundreds of
367360	368600	millions of years old.
369320	372360	The technique has largely been replaced with the far more accurate
372360	376600	argon-argon method and there are other decay processes that can be measured
376600	380200	each with different half-lives such as uranium thorium
380200	384400	and rubidium strontium. Radiometric dating takes us back to the
384400	388360	oldest rocks we found on Earth 3.8 billion years old.
388360	392280	If you want to go back even further you have to look into space.
392280	396600	My video The History of the Universe Made Easy explains how we can calculate
397080	400600	the age of stars and galaxies so I won't repeat that here.
400600	404600	Just take a look at the video. What's important is that the results fit
404600	408960	perfectly with the chronology we find on Earth. The Sun for example
408960	412440	doesn't turn out to be younger than the Earth or older than the universe.
412440	415980	Its age based on the amount of hydrogen fused into helium
415980	421800	is exactly what you'd expect and as with dating methods devised for rocks on Earth
421800	425080	the method for measuring the age of stars and galaxies
425160	429840	is devised first and tested afterwards. There's no way of knowing in advance
429840	431880	what age these tests will show
431880	438880	but every time the age confirms the known chronology of our world.
438880	442320	There's thermoluminescence that can measure the number of trapped electrons
442320	444040	on the surface of volcanic rock.
444040	447480	The speed that continents are drifting can be measured today
447480	450840	so their position millions of years ago can be calculated.
451000	455320	It matches perfectly with the geological chronology we've already worked out.
455320	458600	Climatic banding in sedimentary rocks can be measured
458600	462280	caused by a wobble in the Earth's motion every 12,000 years.
462280	466080	I could go on but there's no time here to list every dating method
466080	469560	let alone spell out the details of how they work.
469560	473320	The important thing is that they do work and attempts to show that they don't
473320	475320	have all been spectacular failures.
475320	478520	I've heard quite a few urban myths about these dating methods.
478880	484200	Here are a few you may have heard.
484200	488600	Yes this really did happen. Because of the rate of radioactive decay
488600	493880	which is very slow, this method can't be used on rocks less than 100,000 years old.
493880	499360	That's very young in geological terms so most volcanic rocks can be dated using
499360	500080	this method
500080	505080	and it works very well. But subjecting a sample of new rock to this dating method
505080	508080	is rather like weighing an elephant on the kitchen scales.
508160	512800	Any result you get is going to be garbage. Actually the best way to date
512800	514440	young volcanic rock samples
514440	518680	is thermoluminescence. Obviously if you want an inaccurate result
518680	525680	well then choose the wrong test and that's just what you're going to get.
526120	529800	This urban myth comes from a bogus test that was performed in 1990
529800	534320	on four fossilized dinosaur bones. The bones came from a museum
534480	537960	and were heavily coated in preservative resin. Hugh Miller
537960	541800	who commissioned these tests was told by the testing laboratory in Arizona
541800	545480	that there was no carbon in the bones so they couldn't be carbon dated.
545480	548920	Now that's one of the most basic principles of carbon dating.
548920	553600	You obviously have to have carbon in the samples and dinosaur bones are so old
553600	556280	the carbon has nearly always been replaced by minerals
556280	561000	as was the case with these samples. The laboratory warned Miller that carbon in
561000	562920	the preservative resin would be measured
563160	566560	not the dinosaur fossil which of course has no carbon in it.
566560	571040	But Miller wanted to do the test anyway. I guess so he could pretend he had
571040	573000	20,000 year old dinosaur bones
573000	577120	and he got the result he wanted. I suppose he could just as well have
577120	578560	spread jam on the fossils
578560	584080	and pretended that they were five years old.
584080	587400	One of the golden rules about carbon dating is that you can't carbon date
587400	588600	marine organisms
588600	592200	and there's a very good reason for that. The further away you get from
592400	596680	atmospheric carbon the less reliable the results and the carbon that goes into
596680	599720	marine organisms is very far removed from the atmosphere.
599720	604920	So carbon dating is useless. In the 1960s one of the biologists who
604920	606240	discovered this phenomenon
606240	609920	known as the reservoir effect warned other biologists about it in a
609920	611000	scientific paper.
611000	614800	To illustrate the point he carbon dated live snails and the result was two
614800	616360	thousand three hundred years.
616360	620540	But while biologists have heeded the lesson and no longer carbon date marine
620540	621240	organisms
621440	625400	the false dating has passed into urban mythology as proof that carbon dating
625400	626160	doesn't work.
626160	629560	So the simple answer to that is on marine organisms
629560	634960	it doesn't. On land it does. So not only do we have the intelligence to work out
634960	636200	what happened in the past
636200	639640	we also have a number of tools to work out when it happened.
639640	644000	And if anyone thinks these tools don't work they shouldn't have to mislead or
644000	644560	cheat.
644560	649240	Just send samples of known age to a lab, ask the technicians to perform the
649240	650960	appropriate test on the material
651200	655120	and see if they come up with the right answer. It's so easy to do
655120	657960	you have to wonder why the skeptics don't dare do it.
