1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,280
In the first two videos we looked at the age of our universe

2
00:00:03,280 --> 00:00:07,680
but how do we know the age of the earth and the ages of the rocks it contains?

3
00:00:07,680 --> 00:00:10,960
Fortunately there are a number of different techniques

4
00:00:10,960 --> 00:00:15,680
and they can all be checked against each other and they all tell us the same story.

5
00:00:15,680 --> 00:00:19,280
Let's start with the benchmark, comparative dating.

6
00:00:19,280 --> 00:00:23,440
The golden rule is that newer sedimentary deposits are always laid on

7
00:00:23,440 --> 00:00:23,880
top of

8
00:00:23,880 --> 00:00:27,240
older ones so except where rocks have been folded

9
00:00:27,400 --> 00:00:31,240
this orange bed would be older than the green one and the green one is older

10
00:00:31,240 --> 00:00:32,200
than the blue one.

11
00:00:32,200 --> 00:00:36,320
Geologists can then follow a single bed to make similar deductions in a

12
00:00:36,320 --> 00:00:37,560
different locality.

13
00:00:37,560 --> 00:00:40,640
The dark grey bed may be at the surface

14
00:00:40,640 --> 00:00:44,840
or even at a higher point than the others but it's older than all of them

15
00:00:44,840 --> 00:00:48,800
and the light grey bed is older still. What we end up with

16
00:00:48,800 --> 00:00:53,640
is what's called the geological column. To get the absolute dates of these rocks

17
00:00:53,720 --> 00:00:57,680
scientists use a variety of different methods. I'll start with one of the

18
00:00:57,680 --> 00:00:59,320
easiest and most recent.

19
00:00:59,320 --> 00:01:04,080
We all know trees have rings because in summer they grow faster than in winter

20
00:01:04,080 --> 00:01:07,640
but seasonal growing conditions vary according to the weather

21
00:01:07,640 --> 00:01:13,320
so the bands will vary in size. Each time period in each geographical location

22
00:01:13,320 --> 00:01:17,240
has its own distinctive pattern of tree rings like a fingerprint.

23
00:01:17,240 --> 00:01:21,640
So if we take wood of a known age we can match the oldest part of it

24
00:01:21,640 --> 00:01:28,640
with the youngest part of another piece of wood and so on back through time.

25
00:01:28,640 --> 00:01:33,080
Our upper atmosphere is constantly being bombarded by neutrons from the Sun.

26
00:01:33,080 --> 00:01:37,320
When one of them hits a nitrogen atom in the air it knocks off a proton

27
00:01:37,320 --> 00:01:42,360
changing the atom from nitrogen into carbon. But this is a heavy and unstable

28
00:01:42,360 --> 00:01:44,760
form of carbon called carbon 14

29
00:01:44,760 --> 00:01:47,840
or C14. The normal form of carbon

30
00:01:47,920 --> 00:01:53,840
is C12. In the atmosphere C14 combines with oxygen to make carbon dioxide

31
00:01:53,840 --> 00:01:57,480
which is then absorbed by plants and into the bodies of

32
00:01:57,480 --> 00:02:02,720
animals that eat the plants. The ratio of these two isotopes in animals and plants

33
00:02:02,720 --> 00:02:06,200
is roughly the same as the ratio in the atmosphere around them.

34
00:02:06,200 --> 00:02:11,240
But when the animal or plant dies C14 decays over time

35
00:02:11,240 --> 00:02:16,200
and reverts back to nitrogen. So compared to C12 which doesn't change

36
00:02:16,320 --> 00:02:20,520
the amount of C14 falls at a constant measurable rate.

37
00:02:20,520 --> 00:02:24,200
By measuring this ratio inside the dead animal or plant

38
00:02:24,200 --> 00:02:29,120
scientists can find out when it died. Before I look at other dating techniques

39
00:02:29,120 --> 00:02:32,080
I'll bat a few hoary old myths about carbon 14

40
00:02:32,080 --> 00:02:35,760
out of the ballpark. No it's not.

41
00:02:35,760 --> 00:02:39,720
That's like saying cars don't work because sometimes drivers get lost.

42
00:02:39,720 --> 00:02:44,040
Carbon dating works fine but if the wrong stuff gets analyzed then you'll

43
00:02:44,040 --> 00:02:45,520
end up getting the wrong date.

44
00:02:45,920 --> 00:02:49,880
So if there's bacteria or mold or any kind of contamination on the sample

45
00:02:49,880 --> 00:02:53,800
the date will be wrong. If the results aren't calibrated properly

46
00:02:53,800 --> 00:02:57,880
the results will be wrong. And in some environments carbon dating is

47
00:02:57,880 --> 00:02:58,800
impractical

48
00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:02,760
so the results will be wrong. But when everything's done properly

49
00:03:02,760 --> 00:03:07,320
the results are right. That's no different to any sophisticated analysis

50
00:03:07,320 --> 00:03:08,000
technique

51
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:13,120
from x-ray imaging to spectroscopy. Contaminated samples don't invalidate

52
00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:15,000
the principle of DNA analysis

53
00:03:15,080 --> 00:03:18,640
or chromatography or spectroscopy. We know they work

54
00:03:18,640 --> 00:03:23,040
and we know carbon dating works. Firstly carbon dating can be checked against

55
00:03:23,040 --> 00:03:24,680
artifacts of known age

56
00:03:24,680 --> 00:03:29,280
such as ship's timber. Secondly it can be checked by sending the same artifact to

57
00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:31,080
different labs for analysis.

58
00:03:31,080 --> 00:03:35,720
Thirdly let's take a sample of organic material from each of these layers.

59
00:03:35,720 --> 00:03:39,880
If carbon dating was random nonsense you'd expect the chronological

60
00:03:39,880 --> 00:03:44,240
order of these samples to be all over the place but that doesn't happen.

61
00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:48,440
The results show each of these samples in its correct chronological

62
00:03:48,440 --> 00:03:52,680
order. The ones from the upper beds are younger and the ones from the lower beds

63
00:03:52,680 --> 00:03:53,360
are older.

64
00:03:53,360 --> 00:03:57,120
Is it magic or is it because carbon dating works

65
00:03:57,120 --> 00:04:00,920
and that's why it's used?

66
00:04:00,920 --> 00:04:04,640
Samples don't come with labels attached telling the lab their age.

67
00:04:04,640 --> 00:04:07,800
Testing is always blind. If it's not blind

68
00:04:07,800 --> 00:04:12,640
it's not science.

69
00:04:12,640 --> 00:04:16,920
But carbon dating isn't used on diamonds and coal and for very good reason.

70
00:04:16,920 --> 00:04:21,720
As I explained C14 is formed when neutrons collide with nitrogen atoms.

71
00:04:21,720 --> 00:04:25,800
The C14 used in carbon dating originated in the atmosphere

72
00:04:25,800 --> 00:04:30,640
but you can also get it deep underground in places where decaying uranium

73
00:04:30,640 --> 00:04:34,600
is giving off neutrons. Coal and diamonds are made of carbon

74
00:04:34,600 --> 00:04:37,760
so you'd expect to find higher levels of C14

75
00:04:37,760 --> 00:04:41,280
in coal and diamonds close to rocks that contain uranium

76
00:04:41,520 --> 00:04:46,800
and much lower levels away from those rocks. And that's exactly what we do find.

77
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:50,280
Carbon dating is only used and only useful

78
00:04:50,280 --> 00:04:53,840
for dating organic material in the top most sedimentary layers.

79
00:04:53,840 --> 00:04:57,600
Now that we've got carbon dating out of the way let's quickly run through a few

80
00:04:57,600 --> 00:04:58,080
more

81
00:04:58,080 --> 00:05:03,840
absolute dating methods. Biologists know that human DNA mutates at a fairly

82
00:05:03,840 --> 00:05:04,840
regular rate

83
00:05:04,840 --> 00:05:09,080
and they can trace these mutations back like following the branches of a tree

84
00:05:09,080 --> 00:05:13,040
back to the trunk. It's not a greatly accurate method but it does give a rough

85
00:05:13,040 --> 00:05:15,240
idea of when humans migrated

86
00:05:15,240 --> 00:05:20,840
and a very definite idea of where.

87
00:05:20,840 --> 00:05:24,000
Africa around 50,000 years ago just as

88
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:29,360
other dating methods suggested it should. Every 250,000 years or so

89
00:05:29,360 --> 00:05:33,800
the Earth's magnetic fields flip over and the South Pole becomes the North Pole.

90
00:05:33,800 --> 00:05:38,120
Magnetized minerals within rocks show the polarity of the Earth when the rocks

91
00:05:38,120 --> 00:05:39,000
were laid down

92
00:05:39,040 --> 00:05:43,640
so throughout the geological column rocks show a regular magnetic banding

93
00:05:43,640 --> 00:05:47,320
depending on the polarity of the Earth and that can be dated.

94
00:05:47,320 --> 00:05:52,080
Potassium-argon dating works on the same principle as carbon dating

95
00:05:52,080 --> 00:05:56,240
but instead of carbon decaying to nitrogen we have potassium decaying to

96
00:05:56,240 --> 00:05:56,840
argon

97
00:05:56,840 --> 00:06:00,280
and instead of a half-life of 5,500 years

98
00:06:00,280 --> 00:06:03,360
we have a half-life of 1.3 billion years.

99
00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:07,360
That means the method can be used for dating rocks and fossils hundreds of

100
00:06:07,360 --> 00:06:08,600
millions of years old.

101
00:06:09,320 --> 00:06:12,360
The technique has largely been replaced with the far more accurate

102
00:06:12,360 --> 00:06:16,600
argon-argon method and there are other decay processes that can be measured

103
00:06:16,600 --> 00:06:20,200
each with different half-lives such as uranium thorium

104
00:06:20,200 --> 00:06:24,400
and rubidium strontium. Radiometric dating takes us back to the

105
00:06:24,400 --> 00:06:28,360
oldest rocks we found on Earth 3.8 billion years old.

106
00:06:28,360 --> 00:06:32,280
If you want to go back even further you have to look into space.

107
00:06:32,280 --> 00:06:36,600
My video The History of the Universe Made Easy explains how we can calculate

108
00:06:37,080 --> 00:06:40,600
the age of stars and galaxies so I won't repeat that here.

109
00:06:40,600 --> 00:06:44,600
Just take a look at the video. What's important is that the results fit

110
00:06:44,600 --> 00:06:48,960
perfectly with the chronology we find on Earth. The Sun for example

111
00:06:48,960 --> 00:06:52,440
doesn't turn out to be younger than the Earth or older than the universe.

112
00:06:52,440 --> 00:06:55,980
Its age based on the amount of hydrogen fused into helium

113
00:06:55,980 --> 00:07:01,800
is exactly what you'd expect and as with dating methods devised for rocks on Earth

114
00:07:01,800 --> 00:07:05,080
the method for measuring the age of stars and galaxies

115
00:07:05,160 --> 00:07:09,840
is devised first and tested afterwards. There's no way of knowing in advance

116
00:07:09,840 --> 00:07:11,880
what age these tests will show

117
00:07:11,880 --> 00:07:18,880
but every time the age confirms the known chronology of our world.

118
00:07:18,880 --> 00:07:22,320
There's thermoluminescence that can measure the number of trapped electrons

119
00:07:22,320 --> 00:07:24,040
on the surface of volcanic rock.

120
00:07:24,040 --> 00:07:27,480
The speed that continents are drifting can be measured today

121
00:07:27,480 --> 00:07:30,840
so their position millions of years ago can be calculated.

122
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:35,320
It matches perfectly with the geological chronology we've already worked out.

123
00:07:35,320 --> 00:07:38,600
Climatic banding in sedimentary rocks can be measured

124
00:07:38,600 --> 00:07:42,280
caused by a wobble in the Earth's motion every 12,000 years.

125
00:07:42,280 --> 00:07:46,080
I could go on but there's no time here to list every dating method

126
00:07:46,080 --> 00:07:49,560
let alone spell out the details of how they work.

127
00:07:49,560 --> 00:07:53,320
The important thing is that they do work and attempts to show that they don't

128
00:07:53,320 --> 00:07:55,320
have all been spectacular failures.

129
00:07:55,320 --> 00:07:58,520
I've heard quite a few urban myths about these dating methods.

130
00:07:58,880 --> 00:08:04,200
Here are a few you may have heard.

131
00:08:04,200 --> 00:08:08,600
Yes this really did happen. Because of the rate of radioactive decay

132
00:08:08,600 --> 00:08:13,880
which is very slow, this method can't be used on rocks less than 100,000 years old.

133
00:08:13,880 --> 00:08:19,360
That's very young in geological terms so most volcanic rocks can be dated using

134
00:08:19,360 --> 00:08:20,080
this method

135
00:08:20,080 --> 00:08:25,080
and it works very well. But subjecting a sample of new rock to this dating method

136
00:08:25,080 --> 00:08:28,080
is rather like weighing an elephant on the kitchen scales.

137
00:08:28,160 --> 00:08:32,800
Any result you get is going to be garbage. Actually the best way to date

138
00:08:32,800 --> 00:08:34,440
young volcanic rock samples

139
00:08:34,440 --> 00:08:38,680
is thermoluminescence. Obviously if you want an inaccurate result

140
00:08:38,680 --> 00:08:45,680
well then choose the wrong test and that's just what you're going to get.

141
00:08:46,120 --> 00:08:49,800
This urban myth comes from a bogus test that was performed in 1990

142
00:08:49,800 --> 00:08:54,320
on four fossilized dinosaur bones. The bones came from a museum

143
00:08:54,480 --> 00:08:57,960
and were heavily coated in preservative resin. Hugh Miller

144
00:08:57,960 --> 00:09:01,800
who commissioned these tests was told by the testing laboratory in Arizona

145
00:09:01,800 --> 00:09:05,480
that there was no carbon in the bones so they couldn't be carbon dated.

146
00:09:05,480 --> 00:09:08,920
Now that's one of the most basic principles of carbon dating.

147
00:09:08,920 --> 00:09:13,600
You obviously have to have carbon in the samples and dinosaur bones are so old

148
00:09:13,600 --> 00:09:16,280
the carbon has nearly always been replaced by minerals

149
00:09:16,280 --> 00:09:21,000
as was the case with these samples. The laboratory warned Miller that carbon in

150
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:22,920
the preservative resin would be measured

151
00:09:23,160 --> 00:09:26,560
not the dinosaur fossil which of course has no carbon in it.

152
00:09:26,560 --> 00:09:31,040
But Miller wanted to do the test anyway. I guess so he could pretend he had

153
00:09:31,040 --> 00:09:33,000
20,000 year old dinosaur bones

154
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:37,120
and he got the result he wanted. I suppose he could just as well have

155
00:09:37,120 --> 00:09:38,560
spread jam on the fossils

156
00:09:38,560 --> 00:09:44,080
and pretended that they were five years old.

157
00:09:44,080 --> 00:09:47,400
One of the golden rules about carbon dating is that you can't carbon date

158
00:09:47,400 --> 00:09:48,600
marine organisms

159
00:09:48,600 --> 00:09:52,200
and there's a very good reason for that. The further away you get from

160
00:09:52,400 --> 00:09:56,680
atmospheric carbon the less reliable the results and the carbon that goes into

161
00:09:56,680 --> 00:09:59,720
marine organisms is very far removed from the atmosphere.

162
00:09:59,720 --> 00:10:04,920
So carbon dating is useless. In the 1960s one of the biologists who

163
00:10:04,920 --> 00:10:06,240
discovered this phenomenon

164
00:10:06,240 --> 00:10:09,920
known as the reservoir effect warned other biologists about it in a

165
00:10:09,920 --> 00:10:11,000
scientific paper.

166
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:14,800
To illustrate the point he carbon dated live snails and the result was two

167
00:10:14,800 --> 00:10:16,360
thousand three hundred years.

168
00:10:16,360 --> 00:10:20,540
But while biologists have heeded the lesson and no longer carbon date marine

169
00:10:20,540 --> 00:10:21,240
organisms

170
00:10:21,440 --> 00:10:25,400
the false dating has passed into urban mythology as proof that carbon dating

171
00:10:25,400 --> 00:10:26,160
doesn't work.

172
00:10:26,160 --> 00:10:29,560
So the simple answer to that is on marine organisms

173
00:10:29,560 --> 00:10:34,960
it doesn't. On land it does. So not only do we have the intelligence to work out

174
00:10:34,960 --> 00:10:36,200
what happened in the past

175
00:10:36,200 --> 00:10:39,640
we also have a number of tools to work out when it happened.

176
00:10:39,640 --> 00:10:44,000
And if anyone thinks these tools don't work they shouldn't have to mislead or

177
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:44,560
cheat.

178
00:10:44,560 --> 00:10:49,240
Just send samples of known age to a lab, ask the technicians to perform the

179
00:10:49,240 --> 00:10:50,960
appropriate test on the material

180
00:10:51,200 --> 00:10:55,120
and see if they come up with the right answer. It's so easy to do

181
00:10:55,120 --> 00:10:57,960
you have to wonder why the skeptics don't dare do it.
