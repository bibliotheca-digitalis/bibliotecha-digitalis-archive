00:00.000 --> 00:03.280
In the first two videos we looked at the age of our universe

00:03.280 --> 00:07.680
but how do we know the age of the earth and the ages of the rocks it contains?

00:07.680 --> 00:10.960
Fortunately there are a number of different techniques

00:10.960 --> 00:15.680
and they can all be checked against each other and they all tell us the same story.

00:15.680 --> 00:19.280
Let's start with the benchmark, comparative dating.

00:19.280 --> 00:23.440
The golden rule is that newer sedimentary deposits are always laid on

00:23.440 --> 00:23.880
top of

00:23.880 --> 00:27.240
older ones so except where rocks have been folded

00:27.400 --> 00:31.240
this orange bed would be older than the green one and the green one is older

00:31.240 --> 00:32.200
than the blue one.

00:32.200 --> 00:36.320
Geologists can then follow a single bed to make similar deductions in a

00:36.320 --> 00:37.560
different locality.

00:37.560 --> 00:40.640
The dark grey bed may be at the surface

00:40.640 --> 00:44.840
or even at a higher point than the others but it's older than all of them

00:44.840 --> 00:48.800
and the light grey bed is older still. What we end up with

00:48.800 --> 00:53.640
is what's called the geological column. To get the absolute dates of these rocks

00:53.720 --> 00:57.680
scientists use a variety of different methods. I'll start with one of the

00:57.680 --> 00:59.320
easiest and most recent.

00:59.320 --> 01:04.080
We all know trees have rings because in summer they grow faster than in winter

01:04.080 --> 01:07.640
but seasonal growing conditions vary according to the weather

01:07.640 --> 01:13.320
so the bands will vary in size. Each time period in each geographical location

01:13.320 --> 01:17.240
has its own distinctive pattern of tree rings like a fingerprint.

01:17.240 --> 01:21.640
So if we take wood of a known age we can match the oldest part of it

01:21.640 --> 01:28.640
with the youngest part of another piece of wood and so on back through time.

01:28.640 --> 01:33.080
Our upper atmosphere is constantly being bombarded by neutrons from the Sun.

01:33.080 --> 01:37.320
When one of them hits a nitrogen atom in the air it knocks off a proton

01:37.320 --> 01:42.360
changing the atom from nitrogen into carbon. But this is a heavy and unstable

01:42.360 --> 01:44.760
form of carbon called carbon 14

01:44.760 --> 01:47.840
or C14. The normal form of carbon

01:47.920 --> 01:53.840
is C12. In the atmosphere C14 combines with oxygen to make carbon dioxide

01:53.840 --> 01:57.480
which is then absorbed by plants and into the bodies of

01:57.480 --> 02:02.720
animals that eat the plants. The ratio of these two isotopes in animals and plants

02:02.720 --> 02:06.200
is roughly the same as the ratio in the atmosphere around them.

02:06.200 --> 02:11.240
But when the animal or plant dies C14 decays over time

02:11.240 --> 02:16.200
and reverts back to nitrogen. So compared to C12 which doesn't change

02:16.320 --> 02:20.520
the amount of C14 falls at a constant measurable rate.

02:20.520 --> 02:24.200
By measuring this ratio inside the dead animal or plant

02:24.200 --> 02:29.120
scientists can find out when it died. Before I look at other dating techniques

02:29.120 --> 02:32.080
I'll bat a few hoary old myths about carbon 14

02:32.080 --> 02:35.760
out of the ballpark. No it's not.

02:35.760 --> 02:39.720
That's like saying cars don't work because sometimes drivers get lost.

02:39.720 --> 02:44.040
Carbon dating works fine but if the wrong stuff gets analyzed then you'll

02:44.040 --> 02:45.520
end up getting the wrong date.

02:45.920 --> 02:49.880
So if there's bacteria or mold or any kind of contamination on the sample

02:49.880 --> 02:53.800
the date will be wrong. If the results aren't calibrated properly

02:53.800 --> 02:57.880
the results will be wrong. And in some environments carbon dating is

02:57.880 --> 02:58.800
impractical

02:58.800 --> 03:02.760
so the results will be wrong. But when everything's done properly

03:02.760 --> 03:07.320
the results are right. That's no different to any sophisticated analysis

03:07.320 --> 03:08.000
technique

03:08.000 --> 03:13.120
from x-ray imaging to spectroscopy. Contaminated samples don't invalidate

03:13.120 --> 03:15.000
the principle of DNA analysis

03:15.080 --> 03:18.640
or chromatography or spectroscopy. We know they work

03:18.640 --> 03:23.040
and we know carbon dating works. Firstly carbon dating can be checked against

03:23.040 --> 03:24.680
artifacts of known age

03:24.680 --> 03:29.280
such as ship's timber. Secondly it can be checked by sending the same artifact to

03:29.280 --> 03:31.080
different labs for analysis.

03:31.080 --> 03:35.720
Thirdly let's take a sample of organic material from each of these layers.

03:35.720 --> 03:39.880
If carbon dating was random nonsense you'd expect the chronological

03:39.880 --> 03:44.240
order of these samples to be all over the place but that doesn't happen.

03:44.560 --> 03:48.440
The results show each of these samples in its correct chronological

03:48.440 --> 03:52.680
order. The ones from the upper beds are younger and the ones from the lower beds

03:52.680 --> 03:53.360
are older.

03:53.360 --> 03:57.120
Is it magic or is it because carbon dating works

03:57.120 --> 04:00.920
and that's why it's used?

04:00.920 --> 04:04.640
Samples don't come with labels attached telling the lab their age.

04:04.640 --> 04:07.800
Testing is always blind. If it's not blind

04:07.800 --> 04:12.640
it's not science.

04:12.640 --> 04:16.920
But carbon dating isn't used on diamonds and coal and for very good reason.

04:16.920 --> 04:21.720
As I explained C14 is formed when neutrons collide with nitrogen atoms.

04:21.720 --> 04:25.800
The C14 used in carbon dating originated in the atmosphere

04:25.800 --> 04:30.640
but you can also get it deep underground in places where decaying uranium

04:30.640 --> 04:34.600
is giving off neutrons. Coal and diamonds are made of carbon

04:34.600 --> 04:37.760
so you'd expect to find higher levels of C14

04:37.760 --> 04:41.280
in coal and diamonds close to rocks that contain uranium

04:41.520 --> 04:46.800
and much lower levels away from those rocks. And that's exactly what we do find.

04:46.800 --> 04:50.280
Carbon dating is only used and only useful

04:50.280 --> 04:53.840
for dating organic material in the top most sedimentary layers.

04:53.840 --> 04:57.600
Now that we've got carbon dating out of the way let's quickly run through a few

04:57.600 --> 04:58.080
more

04:58.080 --> 05:03.840
absolute dating methods. Biologists know that human DNA mutates at a fairly

05:03.840 --> 05:04.840
regular rate

05:04.840 --> 05:09.080
and they can trace these mutations back like following the branches of a tree

05:09.080 --> 05:13.040
back to the trunk. It's not a greatly accurate method but it does give a rough

05:13.040 --> 05:15.240
idea of when humans migrated

05:15.240 --> 05:20.840
and a very definite idea of where.

05:20.840 --> 05:24.000
Africa around 50,000 years ago just as

05:24.000 --> 05:29.360
other dating methods suggested it should. Every 250,000 years or so

05:29.360 --> 05:33.800
the Earth's magnetic fields flip over and the South Pole becomes the North Pole.

05:33.800 --> 05:38.120
Magnetized minerals within rocks show the polarity of the Earth when the rocks

05:38.120 --> 05:39.000
were laid down

05:39.040 --> 05:43.640
so throughout the geological column rocks show a regular magnetic banding

05:43.640 --> 05:47.320
depending on the polarity of the Earth and that can be dated.

05:47.320 --> 05:52.080
Potassium-argon dating works on the same principle as carbon dating

05:52.080 --> 05:56.240
but instead of carbon decaying to nitrogen we have potassium decaying to

05:56.240 --> 05:56.840
argon

05:56.840 --> 06:00.280
and instead of a half-life of 5,500 years

06:00.280 --> 06:03.360
we have a half-life of 1.3 billion years.

06:03.360 --> 06:07.360
That means the method can be used for dating rocks and fossils hundreds of

06:07.360 --> 06:08.600
millions of years old.

06:09.320 --> 06:12.360
The technique has largely been replaced with the far more accurate

06:12.360 --> 06:16.600
argon-argon method and there are other decay processes that can be measured

06:16.600 --> 06:20.200
each with different half-lives such as uranium thorium

06:20.200 --> 06:24.400
and rubidium strontium. Radiometric dating takes us back to the

06:24.400 --> 06:28.360
oldest rocks we found on Earth 3.8 billion years old.

06:28.360 --> 06:32.280
If you want to go back even further you have to look into space.

06:32.280 --> 06:36.600
My video The History of the Universe Made Easy explains how we can calculate

06:37.080 --> 06:40.600
the age of stars and galaxies so I won't repeat that here.

06:40.600 --> 06:44.600
Just take a look at the video. What's important is that the results fit

06:44.600 --> 06:48.960
perfectly with the chronology we find on Earth. The Sun for example

06:48.960 --> 06:52.440
doesn't turn out to be younger than the Earth or older than the universe.

06:52.440 --> 06:55.980
Its age based on the amount of hydrogen fused into helium

06:55.980 --> 07:01.800
is exactly what you'd expect and as with dating methods devised for rocks on Earth

07:01.800 --> 07:05.080
the method for measuring the age of stars and galaxies

07:05.160 --> 07:09.840
is devised first and tested afterwards. There's no way of knowing in advance

07:09.840 --> 07:11.880
what age these tests will show

07:11.880 --> 07:18.880
but every time the age confirms the known chronology of our world.

07:18.880 --> 07:22.320
There's thermoluminescence that can measure the number of trapped electrons

07:22.320 --> 07:24.040
on the surface of volcanic rock.

07:24.040 --> 07:27.480
The speed that continents are drifting can be measured today

07:27.480 --> 07:30.840
so their position millions of years ago can be calculated.

07:31.000 --> 07:35.320
It matches perfectly with the geological chronology we've already worked out.

07:35.320 --> 07:38.600
Climatic banding in sedimentary rocks can be measured

07:38.600 --> 07:42.280
caused by a wobble in the Earth's motion every 12,000 years.

07:42.280 --> 07:46.080
I could go on but there's no time here to list every dating method

07:46.080 --> 07:49.560
let alone spell out the details of how they work.

07:49.560 --> 07:53.320
The important thing is that they do work and attempts to show that they don't

07:53.320 --> 07:55.320
have all been spectacular failures.

07:55.320 --> 07:58.520
I've heard quite a few urban myths about these dating methods.

07:58.880 --> 08:04.200
Here are a few you may have heard.

08:04.200 --> 08:08.600
Yes this really did happen. Because of the rate of radioactive decay

08:08.600 --> 08:13.880
which is very slow, this method can't be used on rocks less than 100,000 years old.

08:13.880 --> 08:19.360
That's very young in geological terms so most volcanic rocks can be dated using

08:19.360 --> 08:20.080
this method

08:20.080 --> 08:25.080
and it works very well. But subjecting a sample of new rock to this dating method

08:25.080 --> 08:28.080
is rather like weighing an elephant on the kitchen scales.

08:28.160 --> 08:32.800
Any result you get is going to be garbage. Actually the best way to date

08:32.800 --> 08:34.440
young volcanic rock samples

08:34.440 --> 08:38.680
is thermoluminescence. Obviously if you want an inaccurate result

08:38.680 --> 08:45.680
well then choose the wrong test and that's just what you're going to get.

08:46.120 --> 08:49.800
This urban myth comes from a bogus test that was performed in 1990

08:49.800 --> 08:54.320
on four fossilized dinosaur bones. The bones came from a museum

08:54.480 --> 08:57.960
and were heavily coated in preservative resin. Hugh Miller

08:57.960 --> 09:01.800
who commissioned these tests was told by the testing laboratory in Arizona

09:01.800 --> 09:05.480
that there was no carbon in the bones so they couldn't be carbon dated.

09:05.480 --> 09:08.920
Now that's one of the most basic principles of carbon dating.

09:08.920 --> 09:13.600
You obviously have to have carbon in the samples and dinosaur bones are so old

09:13.600 --> 09:16.280
the carbon has nearly always been replaced by minerals

09:16.280 --> 09:21.000
as was the case with these samples. The laboratory warned Miller that carbon in

09:21.000 --> 09:22.920
the preservative resin would be measured

09:23.160 --> 09:26.560
not the dinosaur fossil which of course has no carbon in it.

09:26.560 --> 09:31.040
But Miller wanted to do the test anyway. I guess so he could pretend he had

09:31.040 --> 09:33.000
20,000 year old dinosaur bones

09:33.000 --> 09:37.120
and he got the result he wanted. I suppose he could just as well have

09:37.120 --> 09:38.560
spread jam on the fossils

09:38.560 --> 09:44.080
and pretended that they were five years old.

09:44.080 --> 09:47.400
One of the golden rules about carbon dating is that you can't carbon date

09:47.400 --> 09:48.600
marine organisms

09:48.600 --> 09:52.200
and there's a very good reason for that. The further away you get from

09:52.400 --> 09:56.680
atmospheric carbon the less reliable the results and the carbon that goes into

09:56.680 --> 09:59.720
marine organisms is very far removed from the atmosphere.

09:59.720 --> 10:04.920
So carbon dating is useless. In the 1960s one of the biologists who

10:04.920 --> 10:06.240
discovered this phenomenon

10:06.240 --> 10:09.920
known as the reservoir effect warned other biologists about it in a

10:09.920 --> 10:11.000
scientific paper.

10:11.000 --> 10:14.800
To illustrate the point he carbon dated live snails and the result was two

10:14.800 --> 10:16.360
thousand three hundred years.

10:16.360 --> 10:20.540
But while biologists have heeded the lesson and no longer carbon date marine

10:20.540 --> 10:21.240
organisms

10:21.440 --> 10:25.400
the false dating has passed into urban mythology as proof that carbon dating

10:25.400 --> 10:26.160
doesn't work.

10:26.160 --> 10:29.560
So the simple answer to that is on marine organisms

10:29.560 --> 10:34.960
it doesn't. On land it does. So not only do we have the intelligence to work out

10:34.960 --> 10:36.200
what happened in the past

10:36.200 --> 10:39.640
we also have a number of tools to work out when it happened.

10:39.640 --> 10:44.000
And if anyone thinks these tools don't work they shouldn't have to mislead or

10:44.000 --> 10:44.560
cheat.

10:44.560 --> 10:49.240
Just send samples of known age to a lab, ask the technicians to perform the

10:49.240 --> 10:50.960
appropriate test on the material

10:51.200 --> 10:55.120
and see if they come up with the right answer. It's so easy to do

10:55.120 --> 10:57.960
you have to wonder why the skeptics don't dare do it.
