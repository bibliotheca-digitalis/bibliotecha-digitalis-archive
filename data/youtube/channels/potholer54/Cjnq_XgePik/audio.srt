1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:13,000
There's one thing I've noticed about all the Golden Crocoduck nominees over the years.

2
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:18,920
They're nearly all men, or of indeterminate sex, and I began to wonder, is the proud public

3
00:00:18,920 --> 00:00:21,880
display of ignorance somehow just a male thing?

4
00:00:21,880 --> 00:00:27,320
Are women a bit more modest about displaying their private foibles in public, or are they

5
00:00:27,320 --> 00:00:29,480
so much smarter than men?

6
00:00:29,480 --> 00:00:33,840
The realisation was prompted by the fact that we have one lone female nominee for this

7
00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:38,740
year's Golden Crocoduck, who goes by the YouTube name of Aminakin.

8
00:00:38,740 --> 00:00:42,020
Before I tear into her, I'll say this for Aminakin.

9
00:00:42,020 --> 00:00:45,880
Even if she doesn't understand evolution, at least she's tackling a serious science

10
00:00:45,880 --> 00:00:52,080
subject instead of projecting the stereotypical image of women as obsessed with hair and make-up.

11
00:00:52,080 --> 00:00:54,920
So here is her thoughtful opinion of Charles Darwin.

12
00:00:54,920 --> 00:00:58,880
The Elemis Pro Radiance Cream Cleanser, I've used this before because my sister used it,

13
00:00:58,880 --> 00:00:59,880
and it was just...

14
00:00:59,880 --> 00:01:06,840
Inside this kit you get three pieces of skincare, and give you see instead of using your cleanser

15
00:01:06,840 --> 00:01:11,640
in the morning, it's a very simple, basic, everyday eyeliner.

16
00:01:11,640 --> 00:01:16,040
God damn it, will you stop talking about skincare, eye cream and cleanser and give us your opinion

17
00:01:16,040 --> 00:01:17,600
on Charles bloody Darwin?

18
00:01:17,600 --> 00:01:25,000
Basically, his theories had something to do with this idea that man became more and more

19
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:30,200
intelligent, and as man did so, as man evolved, man became whiter and whiter.

20
00:01:30,200 --> 00:01:33,800
That's basically Darwin's theory.

21
00:01:33,800 --> 00:01:34,800
Where do I start?

22
00:01:34,800 --> 00:01:39,040
Well, let's start with the fact that Darwin's theory, as you call it, is not a theory, but

23
00:01:39,040 --> 00:01:42,000
a principle called natural selection.

24
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:46,200
And the principle of natural selection says nothing about people becoming whiter as they

25
00:01:46,200 --> 00:01:48,160
get more intelligent.

26
00:01:48,160 --> 00:01:53,840
It shows how genetic traits that favour survival get passed on to successive generations.

27
00:01:53,840 --> 00:01:58,320
I have no idea whether Darwin thought people got whiter as they got more intelligent, and

28
00:01:58,320 --> 00:02:00,000
it really doesn't matter.

29
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:04,480
All sorts of silly ideas were believed in the 19th century, including the idea that

30
00:02:04,480 --> 00:02:09,760
the superiority of the white races proved creation, and that inferior races had become

31
00:02:09,760 --> 00:02:13,840
savages because of their fall from the Garden of Eden.

32
00:02:13,840 --> 00:02:19,160
Whatever people thought 150 years ago, whether they were arguing for or against creation,

33
00:02:19,160 --> 00:02:22,640
makes no difference to our current scientific knowledge.

34
00:02:22,640 --> 00:02:27,200
But in case Darwin ever did think that intelligence makes you whiter, I'm happy to say that the

35
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:33,080
principle of natural selection and 100 years of research shows that he was wrong.

36
00:02:33,080 --> 00:02:37,960
In fact, natural selection suggests that our ancestors must have got blacker as they became

37
00:02:37,960 --> 00:02:42,720
more intelligent, because when they emerged from the trees and began hunting on the savannah,

38
00:02:42,720 --> 00:02:45,440
they lost their protective covering of fur.

39
00:02:45,440 --> 00:02:49,640
As a result, more melanin was produced in the skin to shield it from the sun's ultraviolet

40
00:02:49,640 --> 00:02:51,000
rays.

41
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:56,520
But the loss of fur and the gain in intelligence were not genetically linked, they simply evolved

42
00:02:56,520 --> 00:02:59,120
together through natural selection.

43
00:02:59,120 --> 00:03:04,600
Similarly, as humans migrated out of Africa to more extreme latitudes, they lost melanin

44
00:03:04,600 --> 00:03:09,120
because they had less need for protection from ultraviolet radiation, and the paler

45
00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:14,480
skin allowed them to absorb what limited ultraviolet radiation they were exposed to in order to

46
00:03:14,480 --> 00:03:17,320
synthesize vitamin D.

47
00:03:17,320 --> 00:03:22,440
How is it Amenakin failed so miserably to understand natural selection, or the fact

48
00:03:22,440 --> 00:03:26,400
that it shows no link between skin colour and intelligence?

49
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:30,800
It all started, of course, with the obligation to follow religious doctrine.

50
00:03:30,800 --> 00:03:35,840
We're not supposed to believe in evolution, we're not supposed to believe that this is

51
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:39,800
how it happened, so I really wanted to look into it and see what Islam had to say about

52
00:03:39,800 --> 00:03:40,800
all this.

53
00:03:40,800 --> 00:03:48,000
I happened to come across this book randomly one day, and I was completely hooked as soon

54
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:49,640
as I began to read it.

55
00:03:49,640 --> 00:03:55,080
At the front it says, the scientific collapse of Darwinism and its ideological background.

56
00:03:55,080 --> 00:04:00,520
You know, if you want to find out what Darwin's basic idea was, why not read the paper he

57
00:04:00,520 --> 00:04:02,680
co-wrote, or the book he wrote?

58
00:04:02,680 --> 00:04:06,900
Better yet, get up to date, because there's been well over a century of research since

59
00:04:06,900 --> 00:04:10,080
Darwin published The Origin of Species.

60
00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:11,080
Let me explain.

61
00:04:11,080 --> 00:04:15,680
If I wanted to read and understand, say, the history of Islam, I think you'd be the first

62
00:04:15,680 --> 00:04:20,640
to criticise me if the only book I singled out for reading was titled Why Islam is a

63
00:04:20,640 --> 00:04:22,480
Load of Nonsense.

64
00:04:22,480 --> 00:04:27,280
Wouldn't you suggest I read a history textbook, or perhaps check what I was reading against

65
00:04:27,280 --> 00:04:32,060
other sources, to verify that Why Islam is a Load of Nonsense isn't leading me up the

66
00:04:32,060 --> 00:04:33,060
garden path?

67
00:04:33,060 --> 00:04:36,280
When I began to read this book, this book really takes it from the start.

68
00:04:36,280 --> 00:04:40,360
It actually explains that in order to believe in the theory of evolution, you've not only

69
00:04:40,360 --> 00:04:46,600
got to believe that man evolved from ape, but that the very, very first molecule that

70
00:04:46,600 --> 00:04:49,760
ever existed came about by chance.

71
00:04:49,760 --> 00:04:52,720
No, you don't have to believe that at all.

72
00:04:52,720 --> 00:04:56,320
You just need a fifth grader's understanding of basic chemistry.

73
00:04:56,320 --> 00:05:01,080
The first atoms were hydrogen and helium, so it's likely that the first molecules were

74
00:05:01,080 --> 00:05:04,720
hydrogen atoms joined together in a covalent bond.

75
00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:08,640
If you believe this happened by chance, then we wouldn't be able to repeat that reaction

76
00:05:08,640 --> 00:05:13,520
billions of times over in science classrooms, of the kind you fell asleep in.

77
00:05:13,520 --> 00:05:17,900
Here's an experiment I used to do with my kids in the garden shed.

78
00:05:17,900 --> 00:05:22,400
Take some zinc, add hydrochloric acid, and you'll get a reaction.

79
00:05:22,400 --> 00:05:27,360
Each of the hydrogen atoms joins in pairs to make hydrogen gas, and each zinc atom combines

80
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:30,600
with two chlorine atoms to make zinc chloride.

81
00:05:30,600 --> 00:05:36,240
This isn't pure chance, it's 100% predictable and reliable because it's based on simple

82
00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:37,240
chemistry.

83
00:05:37,240 --> 00:05:41,760
If everything happened by chance, then you really have to extend it right to the beginning

84
00:05:41,760 --> 00:05:42,760
of life itself.

85
00:05:42,760 --> 00:05:46,320
So you really have to think about it in terms of life being a product of the building blocks

86
00:05:46,320 --> 00:05:50,400
which are protein molecules, and then he sort of breaks it down and he says, okay, protein's

87
00:05:50,400 --> 00:05:51,400
made of amino acids.

88
00:05:51,400 --> 00:05:55,880
So you really have to think about the idea that when the Earth came about after the Big

89
00:05:55,880 --> 00:06:03,880
Bang, there were these amino acids that somehow got formed by chance.

90
00:06:03,880 --> 00:06:09,480
The atomic matter just happened to sort of form itself into amino acids.

91
00:06:09,480 --> 00:06:13,620
Amino acids didn't somehow get formed by chance.

92
00:06:13,620 --> 00:06:17,800
We know how amino acids form just as we know how hydrogen atoms form.

93
00:06:17,800 --> 00:06:19,800
Again, it's chemical bonding.

94
00:06:19,800 --> 00:06:24,700
Look, if you don't want to add a book on chemistry to your rather lonely library, let me explain

95
00:06:24,700 --> 00:06:27,820
the subject through something you're more familiar with, cosmetics.

96
00:06:27,820 --> 00:06:28,820
It lasts for ages.

97
00:06:28,820 --> 00:06:34,260
Now it's a 10% benzoyl peroxide acne treatment gel, that's what it says on the front.

98
00:06:34,260 --> 00:06:35,260
Great.

99
00:06:35,260 --> 00:06:38,460
So you accept that there's a chemical called benzoyl peroxide.

100
00:06:38,460 --> 00:06:43,100
What makes one set of chemical reactions a natural part of a daily beauty regime and

101
00:06:43,100 --> 00:06:47,300
another set of chemical reactions an impossible chance happening?

102
00:06:47,300 --> 00:06:51,420
Of course you can say that at the beginning of time an invisible being dictated that this

103
00:06:51,420 --> 00:06:53,740
is how atoms should interact.

104
00:06:53,740 --> 00:06:54,740
Believe what you like.

105
00:06:54,740 --> 00:06:59,280
But the fact is that this is how chemicals do interact in a way that's controlled and

106
00:06:59,280 --> 00:07:02,220
predictable and well understood.

107
00:07:02,220 --> 00:07:06,320
There are billions of smart women out there, but it's nice to know that a few of them can

108
00:07:06,320 --> 00:07:11,140
match creationist men when it comes to complete ignorance of basic science.

109
00:07:11,140 --> 00:07:16,780
And just in case anyone thinks I'm being sexist by continually focusing on creationist men,

110
00:07:16,780 --> 00:07:21,740
let's redress the balance a bit with pothole of salute to creationist women.

111
00:07:21,740 --> 00:07:23,740
Well, isn't that special?

112
00:07:23,740 --> 00:07:28,740
For years carbon dating was believed to be the best way to accurately date artifacts.

113
00:07:28,740 --> 00:07:32,740
Recently experts have discovered it's not as accurate as evolutionists would like me

114
00:07:32,740 --> 00:07:33,740
to think.

115
00:07:34,700 --> 00:07:49,700
The revolution is a product of chance happenings that led to the formation of us.

116
00:07:54,700 --> 00:07:59,700
There's microevolution within species, but not going from one species to another.

117
00:07:59,700 --> 00:08:00,700
Oh really?

118
00:08:01,660 --> 00:08:18,660
There is a controversy among scientists about whether evolution is a bad thing or not.

119
00:08:21,660 --> 00:08:25,660
Evolution is a myth and even Darwin can tell.

120
00:08:25,660 --> 00:08:33,620
Why are monkeys still evolving into humans?

121
00:08:56,620 --> 00:09:05,620
No, I do not believe in evolution, I do not think it should be taught in school.

122
00:09:05,620 --> 00:09:10,620
I do feel that evolution shouldn't be taught in school just because of so many different

123
00:09:10,620 --> 00:09:11,620
views on it.

124
00:09:11,620 --> 00:09:15,620
Evolution should be taught as what it is, as a theory, but evolution should be taught

125
00:09:15,620 --> 00:09:16,620
as facts.

126
00:09:16,620 --> 00:09:19,620
I think facts, not theories, should be taught.

127
00:09:19,620 --> 00:09:24,620
Yes, let's stop teaching scientific theories in school, like heliocentric theory that says

128
00:09:25,580 --> 00:09:29,580
the Earth revolves around the Sun, atomic theory, germ theory, plate tectonic theory,

129
00:09:29,580 --> 00:09:32,580
and let's not forget the theory of tides.

130
00:09:36,580 --> 00:09:41,580
That's right Billy, we stopped teaching scientific theories in school and then it's anybody's

131
00:09:41,580 --> 00:09:44,580
guess what makes the tides go in and out.

132
00:09:44,580 --> 00:09:49,580
And thanks to all the girls for the chance to show that for every Ken, there's a Barbie.

133
00:09:54,620 --> 00:09:58,580
only not somebody's imagination or hope or whatnot.
