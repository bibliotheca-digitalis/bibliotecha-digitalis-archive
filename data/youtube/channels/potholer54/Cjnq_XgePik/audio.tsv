0	13000	There's one thing I've noticed about all the Golden Crocoduck nominees over the years.
13000	18920	They're nearly all men, or of indeterminate sex, and I began to wonder, is the proud public
18920	21880	display of ignorance somehow just a male thing?
21880	27320	Are women a bit more modest about displaying their private foibles in public, or are they
27320	29480	so much smarter than men?
29480	33840	The realisation was prompted by the fact that we have one lone female nominee for this
33840	38740	year's Golden Crocoduck, who goes by the YouTube name of Aminakin.
38740	42020	Before I tear into her, I'll say this for Aminakin.
42020	45880	Even if she doesn't understand evolution, at least she's tackling a serious science
45880	52080	subject instead of projecting the stereotypical image of women as obsessed with hair and make-up.
52080	54920	So here is her thoughtful opinion of Charles Darwin.
54920	58880	The Elemis Pro Radiance Cream Cleanser, I've used this before because my sister used it,
58880	59880	and it was just...
59880	66840	Inside this kit you get three pieces of skincare, and give you see instead of using your cleanser
66840	71640	in the morning, it's a very simple, basic, everyday eyeliner.
71640	76040	God damn it, will you stop talking about skincare, eye cream and cleanser and give us your opinion
76040	77600	on Charles bloody Darwin?
77600	85000	Basically, his theories had something to do with this idea that man became more and more
85000	90200	intelligent, and as man did so, as man evolved, man became whiter and whiter.
90200	93800	That's basically Darwin's theory.
93800	94800	Where do I start?
94800	99040	Well, let's start with the fact that Darwin's theory, as you call it, is not a theory, but
99040	102000	a principle called natural selection.
102000	106200	And the principle of natural selection says nothing about people becoming whiter as they
106200	108160	get more intelligent.
108160	113840	It shows how genetic traits that favour survival get passed on to successive generations.
113840	118320	I have no idea whether Darwin thought people got whiter as they got more intelligent, and
118320	120000	it really doesn't matter.
120000	124480	All sorts of silly ideas were believed in the 19th century, including the idea that
124480	129760	the superiority of the white races proved creation, and that inferior races had become
129760	133840	savages because of their fall from the Garden of Eden.
133840	139160	Whatever people thought 150 years ago, whether they were arguing for or against creation,
139160	142640	makes no difference to our current scientific knowledge.
142640	147200	But in case Darwin ever did think that intelligence makes you whiter, I'm happy to say that the
147200	153080	principle of natural selection and 100 years of research shows that he was wrong.
153080	157960	In fact, natural selection suggests that our ancestors must have got blacker as they became
157960	162720	more intelligent, because when they emerged from the trees and began hunting on the savannah,
162720	165440	they lost their protective covering of fur.
165440	169640	As a result, more melanin was produced in the skin to shield it from the sun's ultraviolet
169640	171000	rays.
171000	176520	But the loss of fur and the gain in intelligence were not genetically linked, they simply evolved
176520	179120	together through natural selection.
179120	184600	Similarly, as humans migrated out of Africa to more extreme latitudes, they lost melanin
184600	189120	because they had less need for protection from ultraviolet radiation, and the paler
189120	194480	skin allowed them to absorb what limited ultraviolet radiation they were exposed to in order to
194480	197320	synthesize vitamin D.
197320	202440	How is it Amenakin failed so miserably to understand natural selection, or the fact
202440	206400	that it shows no link between skin colour and intelligence?
206400	210800	It all started, of course, with the obligation to follow religious doctrine.
210800	215840	We're not supposed to believe in evolution, we're not supposed to believe that this is
215840	219800	how it happened, so I really wanted to look into it and see what Islam had to say about
219800	220800	all this.
220800	228000	I happened to come across this book randomly one day, and I was completely hooked as soon
228000	229640	as I began to read it.
229640	235080	At the front it says, the scientific collapse of Darwinism and its ideological background.
235080	240520	You know, if you want to find out what Darwin's basic idea was, why not read the paper he
240520	242680	co-wrote, or the book he wrote?
242680	246900	Better yet, get up to date, because there's been well over a century of research since
246900	250080	Darwin published The Origin of Species.
250080	251080	Let me explain.
251080	255680	If I wanted to read and understand, say, the history of Islam, I think you'd be the first
255680	260640	to criticise me if the only book I singled out for reading was titled Why Islam is a
260640	262480	Load of Nonsense.
262480	267280	Wouldn't you suggest I read a history textbook, or perhaps check what I was reading against
267280	272060	other sources, to verify that Why Islam is a Load of Nonsense isn't leading me up the
272060	273060	garden path?
273060	276280	When I began to read this book, this book really takes it from the start.
276280	280360	It actually explains that in order to believe in the theory of evolution, you've not only
280360	286600	got to believe that man evolved from ape, but that the very, very first molecule that
286600	289760	ever existed came about by chance.
289760	292720	No, you don't have to believe that at all.
292720	296320	You just need a fifth grader's understanding of basic chemistry.
296320	301080	The first atoms were hydrogen and helium, so it's likely that the first molecules were
301080	304720	hydrogen atoms joined together in a covalent bond.
304720	308640	If you believe this happened by chance, then we wouldn't be able to repeat that reaction
308640	313520	billions of times over in science classrooms, of the kind you fell asleep in.
313520	317900	Here's an experiment I used to do with my kids in the garden shed.
317900	322400	Take some zinc, add hydrochloric acid, and you'll get a reaction.
322400	327360	Each of the hydrogen atoms joins in pairs to make hydrogen gas, and each zinc atom combines
327360	330600	with two chlorine atoms to make zinc chloride.
330600	336240	This isn't pure chance, it's 100% predictable and reliable because it's based on simple
336240	337240	chemistry.
337240	341760	If everything happened by chance, then you really have to extend it right to the beginning
341760	342760	of life itself.
342760	346320	So you really have to think about it in terms of life being a product of the building blocks
346320	350400	which are protein molecules, and then he sort of breaks it down and he says, okay, protein's
350400	351400	made of amino acids.
351400	355880	So you really have to think about the idea that when the Earth came about after the Big
355880	363880	Bang, there were these amino acids that somehow got formed by chance.
363880	369480	The atomic matter just happened to sort of form itself into amino acids.
369480	373620	Amino acids didn't somehow get formed by chance.
373620	377800	We know how amino acids form just as we know how hydrogen atoms form.
377800	379800	Again, it's chemical bonding.
379800	384700	Look, if you don't want to add a book on chemistry to your rather lonely library, let me explain
384700	387820	the subject through something you're more familiar with, cosmetics.
387820	388820	It lasts for ages.
388820	394260	Now it's a 10% benzoyl peroxide acne treatment gel, that's what it says on the front.
394260	395260	Great.
395260	398460	So you accept that there's a chemical called benzoyl peroxide.
398460	403100	What makes one set of chemical reactions a natural part of a daily beauty regime and
403100	407300	another set of chemical reactions an impossible chance happening?
407300	411420	Of course you can say that at the beginning of time an invisible being dictated that this
411420	413740	is how atoms should interact.
413740	414740	Believe what you like.
414740	419280	But the fact is that this is how chemicals do interact in a way that's controlled and
419280	422220	predictable and well understood.
422220	426320	There are billions of smart women out there, but it's nice to know that a few of them can
426320	431140	match creationist men when it comes to complete ignorance of basic science.
431140	436780	And just in case anyone thinks I'm being sexist by continually focusing on creationist men,
436780	441740	let's redress the balance a bit with pothole of salute to creationist women.
441740	443740	Well, isn't that special?
443740	448740	For years carbon dating was believed to be the best way to accurately date artifacts.
448740	452740	Recently experts have discovered it's not as accurate as evolutionists would like me
452740	453740	to think.
454700	469700	The revolution is a product of chance happenings that led to the formation of us.
474700	479700	There's microevolution within species, but not going from one species to another.
479700	480700	Oh really?
481660	498660	There is a controversy among scientists about whether evolution is a bad thing or not.
501660	505660	Evolution is a myth and even Darwin can tell.
505660	513620	Why are monkeys still evolving into humans?
536620	545620	No, I do not believe in evolution, I do not think it should be taught in school.
545620	550620	I do feel that evolution shouldn't be taught in school just because of so many different
550620	551620	views on it.
551620	555620	Evolution should be taught as what it is, as a theory, but evolution should be taught
555620	556620	as facts.
556620	559620	I think facts, not theories, should be taught.
559620	564620	Yes, let's stop teaching scientific theories in school, like heliocentric theory that says
565580	569580	the Earth revolves around the Sun, atomic theory, germ theory, plate tectonic theory,
569580	572580	and let's not forget the theory of tides.
576580	581580	That's right Billy, we stopped teaching scientific theories in school and then it's anybody's
581580	584580	guess what makes the tides go in and out.
584580	589580	And thanks to all the girls for the chance to show that for every Ken, there's a Barbie.
594620	598580	only not somebody's imagination or hope or whatnot.
