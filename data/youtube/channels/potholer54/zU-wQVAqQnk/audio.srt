1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,780
of Ognung Padang. I realise that this is an artist's rendition of what it would look like.

2
00:00:04,780 --> 00:00:08,340
This is in Indonesia, tell me what this is. Yes, but it's based on the very solid science

3
00:00:08,340 --> 00:00:13,340
and archaeological work. Why is there a 20,000 year old pyramids in

4
00:00:13,340 --> 00:00:16,440
Indonesia? That's a very good question. The great pyramids

5
00:00:16,440 --> 00:00:24,020
of Egypt are 4,500 years old. The Mayan pyramids are less than 2,000 years old. So how did

6
00:00:24,020 --> 00:00:30,400
Graham Hancock manage to find a 20,000 year old pyramid in Indonesia?

7
00:00:30,400 --> 00:00:35,160
In this video we'll find the answer to that, and you won't believe how he did it. Well,

8
00:00:35,160 --> 00:00:40,000
maybe you will if you're familiar with Hancock's body of work. And please mirror this video

9
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:45,440
because it could very soon get blocked. If you're a Graham Hancock fan and you think

10
00:00:45,440 --> 00:00:50,640
everyone else should open their minds enough to share his belief, here's a challenge.

11
00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:57,100
Will you open your mind enough to watch this video and see what Hancock missed and fabricated

12
00:00:57,100 --> 00:01:02,900
in his new Netflix series Ancient Apocalypse? Can't hurt, can it?

13
00:01:02,900 --> 00:01:08,220
There used to be a popular programme in the UK called Time Team with actor Tony Robinson,

14
00:01:08,220 --> 00:01:14,280
playing the non-scientist, reporting on various archaeological digs around Britain. In one

15
00:01:14,280 --> 00:01:20,100
programme they were investigating a geophysical anomaly believed to be an old Roman villa.

16
00:01:20,100 --> 00:01:25,760
But the bits of pottery and brick they dug up kept pointing to a medieval monastery instead.

17
00:01:25,760 --> 00:01:31,860
That's not what we want to find, said a disappointed Tony. Professor Mick Aston, who

18
00:01:31,860 --> 00:01:38,340
supervised the digs, had to patiently explain how archaeology works. What we want to find

19
00:01:38,340 --> 00:01:44,080
as archaeologists, he said, is the answer to whatever was here. And if it was a medieval

20
00:01:44,080 --> 00:01:48,640
monastery then we find what we find.

21
00:01:48,640 --> 00:01:53,900
And that's the difference between a professional scientist and an enthusiastic amateur. When

22
00:01:53,900 --> 00:01:59,860
it comes to answering questions about history, archaeologists want to find whatever is actually

23
00:01:59,860 --> 00:02:05,820
there. Because each piece of evidence, each discovery, however dull or disappointing it

24
00:02:05,820 --> 00:02:11,600
may be, fills in another piece of our jigsaw puzzle that starts to give a complete and

25
00:02:11,600 --> 00:02:15,140
accurate history of our species.

26
00:02:15,140 --> 00:02:20,840
The quest for lost civilisations has been a book and movie favourite for years. In the

27
00:02:20,840 --> 00:02:26,640
1970s, Erich von Daniken promoted the idea that aliens had come to Earth to teach ancient

28
00:02:26,640 --> 00:02:32,560
people how to build things. Once that fad had passed, Graham Hancock swiped von Daniken's

29
00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:38,040
book titles and the aliens became emissaries from a lost civilisation, wiped out about

30
00:02:38,040 --> 00:02:43,040
12,000 years ago. Who taught ancient people how to build things?

31
00:02:43,040 --> 00:02:47,140
The last thing we want to believe, it seems, is that our ancestors were smart enough to

32
00:02:47,140 --> 00:02:52,800
learn for themselves how to build these things over a long period of time. But if outside

33
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:57,980
help is always needed, I wonder how Hancock's imaginary civilisation figured it all out

34
00:02:57,980 --> 00:03:08,220
on their own. And he's still searching because after 30 years of touring the world, Hancock

35
00:03:08,220 --> 00:03:15,160
still hasn't discovered a single town, or a burial site, or a boat, no writing, not

36
00:03:15,160 --> 00:03:21,400
even a garbage dump. Hancock's explanation is that this civilisation existed somewhere

37
00:03:21,400 --> 00:03:23,160
he doesn't go, like…

38
00:03:23,160 --> 00:03:27,560
One of them is the Amazon, another is the Sahara Desert, and then under the continental

39
00:03:27,560 --> 00:03:28,560
shells.

40
00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:32,920
And let's not forget buried under the ice of Antarctica, which he proposed in his book

41
00:03:32,920 --> 00:03:38,460
– Fingerprints of the Gods. But the one thing we know about this imaginary civilisation

42
00:03:38,460 --> 00:03:44,660
is that they were supposedly experts at building huge pyramids. But despite commercial and

43
00:03:44,660 --> 00:03:50,540
private planes flying all over these remote places, plus the advent of Google Earth, no

44
00:03:50,540 --> 00:03:55,860
one spotted a single one. Even Hancock hasn't bothered to spend some of the millions he

45
00:03:55,860 --> 00:04:02,900
made selling books and TV programmes to hire a private plane and look for his lost civilisation.

46
00:04:02,900 --> 00:04:07,520
The only place on Earth where we know for sure this pyramid-building civilisation did

47
00:04:07,520 --> 00:04:13,680
exist is in Hancock's head, because he'll be the first one to tell you that this isn't

48
00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:20,120
a fact, it's his belief. Which is fine. Where he comes into conflict with reality

49
00:04:20,120 --> 00:04:25,840
is where he claims he's found mysteries that support his belief. Hancock's ideas

50
00:04:25,840 --> 00:04:31,020
have been laid out in numerous books and TV shows, and now a Netflix series, thanks to

51
00:04:31,020 --> 00:04:35,600
whoever posted the message alerting me to it. I had intended to go through the whole

52
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:41,080
series and see if I could spot any errors, but no kidding, by the time I got to the end

53
00:04:41,080 --> 00:04:48,120
of just the first episode I found so many fabrications, omissions and misrepresentations

54
00:04:48,120 --> 00:04:53,880
that I already had enough to fill this entire video, which turns out to be the longest I've

55
00:04:53,880 --> 00:04:55,920
ever made.

56
00:04:55,920 --> 00:05:00,140
Before we start, you need to understand that as well as copying von Tannachan's book

57
00:05:00,140 --> 00:05:06,660
titles, Hancock also follows von Tannachan's tried and tested modus operandi for leading

58
00:05:06,660 --> 00:05:13,620
an unsceptical audience, as we'll see throughout. And rule number one is, start by painting

59
00:05:13,620 --> 00:05:19,300
professional archaeologists as bumbling, dogmatic and baffled by whatever they find.

60
00:05:19,300 --> 00:05:24,740
Of course, this idea is upsetting to the so-called experts. The extremely defensive, arrogant

61
00:05:24,740 --> 00:05:29,440
and patronising attitude of mainstream academia. The initial evidence has utterly confounded

62
00:05:29,440 --> 00:05:34,080
mainstream archaeologists. Then step in as a persecuted visionary who

63
00:05:34,080 --> 00:05:38,400
dares to challenge them with innovative new ideas.

64
00:05:38,400 --> 00:05:43,480
The series kicks off at a megalithic site in Indonesia called Gunung Padang, and within

65
00:05:43,480 --> 00:05:49,100
a few minutes, Hancock is already softening up his audience with rule number one, portray

66
00:05:49,100 --> 00:05:53,760
archaeologists as a bunch of incompetence who wouldn't know a significant site if

67
00:05:53,780 --> 00:05:55,260
they tripped over it.

68
00:05:55,260 --> 00:06:01,760
For a long while, archaeologists thought it was just another hill in the jungle. But there was a problem with that view.

69
00:06:01,760 --> 00:06:08,060
Yes, there was a problem with that view. Hancock made it up. And there's no better evidence

70
00:06:08,060 --> 00:06:16,060
for that than Hancock himself. In a speech posted in 2018, Hancock's claim was qualified.

71
00:06:16,060 --> 00:06:22,060
For a very long time, it was thought to be just a natural hill.

72
00:06:22,060 --> 00:06:23,060
That's all?

73
00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:28,360
With an interesting megalithic site on top of it.

74
00:06:28,360 --> 00:06:35,480
Ah, yes, just an ordinary hill with a megalithic site on top of it. And in an earlier interview

75
00:06:35,480 --> 00:06:38,360
posted in 2016, he said this.

76
00:06:38,360 --> 00:06:42,360
For a very long time, people believed that it was just a natural hill.

77
00:06:42,360 --> 00:06:43,360
With?

78
00:06:43,360 --> 00:06:47,860
With an old, but not extremely old megalithic site on top of it.

79
00:06:47,860 --> 00:06:52,760
So clearly, Hancock knew that his claim in the Netflix film that archaeologists thought

80
00:06:52,760 --> 00:06:58,960
this was just another hill was nonsense. He made this up simply because it made archaeologists

81
00:06:58,960 --> 00:07:02,960
look stupid and it made him look smart.

82
00:07:02,960 --> 00:07:05,460
And there's no excuse for this fabrication either.

83
00:07:05,460 --> 00:07:10,060
At first sight, this open terrace could be mistaken for a natural formation of volcanic

84
00:07:10,060 --> 00:07:14,460
rock, which is why archaeologists were so slow to investigate it.

85
00:07:14,460 --> 00:07:19,820
But archaeologists didn't mistake it for a natural formation, as Hancock well knows.

86
00:07:19,820 --> 00:07:23,320
And he also knows they weren't slow to investigate it.

87
00:07:23,320 --> 00:07:28,620
Again, we have to go back to other statements Hancock made to show he knew that very well.

88
00:07:28,620 --> 00:07:33,120
It's a megalithic site that's been in plain view and was in fact first inspected by archaeologists

89
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:34,620
as early as 1914.

90
00:07:34,620 --> 00:07:42,580
Yes, a megalithic site in plain view, not mistaken for a natural formation, and investigated

91
00:07:42,580 --> 00:07:48,860
as far back as 1914 when a Dutch archaeologist wrote a report about it.

92
00:07:48,900 --> 00:07:53,900
The site was forgotten about during the turmoil of World War II and the bitter war that ended

93
00:07:53,900 --> 00:08:01,140
Dutch colonial rule, but when three farmers rediscovered it in 1979, Indonesian archaeologists

94
00:08:01,140 --> 00:08:03,300
immediately investigated.

95
00:08:03,300 --> 00:08:09,340
Indonesia's National Research Centre of Archaeology issued a report on Gunung Padang

96
00:08:09,340 --> 00:08:15,840
in 1985. At that time, Hancock was writing a book about the AIDS epidemic.

97
00:08:15,840 --> 00:08:21,000
After the National Research Centre of Archaeology came studies and investigations by archaeologists

98
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:26,680
from Indonesia's Directorate of Antiquities, the National Archaeological Research and Development

99
00:08:26,680 --> 00:08:30,660
Institute and the Bandung Archaeological Centre.

100
00:08:30,660 --> 00:08:36,320
So ironically, archaeologists took an interest in the site long before Hancock did.

101
00:08:36,320 --> 00:08:39,880
If you want to know what archaeologists really think, ask them.

102
00:08:39,880 --> 00:08:44,760
Don't get a summary of their investigations and conclusions from the guy whose success

103
00:08:44,760 --> 00:08:47,400
depends on discrediting them.

104
00:08:47,400 --> 00:08:53,040
They conclude that evidence shows Gunung Padang is an old extinct volcano into which at least

105
00:08:53,040 --> 00:08:58,160
five terraces have been cut near the top, one of which has a retaining wall.

106
00:08:58,160 --> 00:09:03,440
Rough enclosures and pavements have been laid out, as well as stairs up to the site, using

107
00:09:03,440 --> 00:09:08,480
readily available volcanic columns as building material.

108
00:09:08,480 --> 00:09:12,360
And it was built around 2,500 years ago.

109
00:09:12,380 --> 00:09:18,400
These hexagonal columns form when molten lava comes out of the volcano, cools quickly, shrinks

110
00:09:18,400 --> 00:09:23,560
and creates hexagonal cracks. Even Hancock accepts that.

111
00:09:23,560 --> 00:09:28,760
When they weather, they collapse, forming loosely scattered columnar joints.

112
00:09:28,760 --> 00:09:33,720
You can see loosely scattered columnar joints not only at Gunung Padang, but also other

113
00:09:33,720 --> 00:09:38,200
sites like Detunata Goala in Romania.

114
00:09:38,200 --> 00:09:43,200
But unlike Gunung Padang, they haven't been arranged in patterns and no terraces have

115
00:09:43,200 --> 00:09:45,000
been cut.

116
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:51,560
There are dozens of megalithic sites in Indonesia, but Gunung Padang is the largest.

117
00:09:51,560 --> 00:09:56,240
After painting a picture of archaeologists as a bunch of nay-saying incompetence, Hancock

118
00:09:56,240 --> 00:10:02,720
interviews a geologist called Danny Natawijaja, who, for the purposes of his programme, represents

119
00:10:02,720 --> 00:10:04,040
the complete opposite.

120
00:10:04,040 --> 00:10:10,680
Dr Danny Hillman Natawijaja studied at Caltech, but now works for Indonesia's geotechnology

121
00:10:10,680 --> 00:10:12,160
research centre.

122
00:10:12,160 --> 00:10:15,800
So a professional, sober, competent geologist.

123
00:10:15,800 --> 00:10:19,880
Absolutely, Danny comes at this as a scientist. His interest is that.

124
00:10:19,880 --> 00:10:25,080
Yeah, good, someone who's completely impartial and only interested in the science, and what

125
00:10:25,080 --> 00:10:27,160
his scientific equipment tells him.

126
00:10:27,160 --> 00:10:32,240
They did ground penetrating radar, seismic tomography, electrical resistivity.

127
00:10:32,240 --> 00:10:37,720
Alright Graham, lots and lots of real and objective science. We get the point.

128
00:10:37,720 --> 00:10:42,920
There had been an archaeological team excavating the site since 2011.

129
00:10:42,920 --> 00:10:49,760
Then in 2013, Natawijaja independently started his own investigation using drills and ground

130
00:10:49,760 --> 00:10:51,880
penetrating radar.

131
00:10:51,880 --> 00:10:53,840
Hancock describes what happened next.

132
00:10:53,840 --> 00:10:58,880
An extraordinary new possibility began to force itself on the researchers.

133
00:10:58,880 --> 00:11:05,280
That they might be confronted by the work of a civilisation lost to history.

134
00:11:05,280 --> 00:11:10,000
But of course, this is a Hancock film, so things are not always as straightforward as

135
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:12,560
the story we're being told.

136
00:11:12,560 --> 00:11:19,800
Natawijaja is indeed a geologist, a renowned seismologist, very competent in his own field,

137
00:11:19,800 --> 00:11:22,180
and here's one of his books.

138
00:11:22,180 --> 00:11:28,020
But he's also been a long-time proponent of the idea that Indonesia is the site of

139
00:11:28,020 --> 00:11:29,020
Atlantis.

140
00:11:29,020 --> 00:11:31,780
Yes, you heard that right.

141
00:11:31,780 --> 00:11:36,220
He's not only promoted the idea in print, he explained it to Graham Hancock in previous

142
00:11:36,220 --> 00:11:39,940
interviews as far back as 2014.

143
00:11:39,940 --> 00:11:45,660
So the idea of an ancient civilisation was hardly forced on Natawijaja. He'd already

144
00:11:45,660 --> 00:11:51,840
reached that conclusion long before he started his 2013 investigation.

145
00:11:51,840 --> 00:11:55,360
But none of that was mentioned in the Netflix programme.

146
00:11:55,360 --> 00:12:01,120
Natawijaja never published his findings, so all we can go on is a poster he showed at

147
00:12:01,120 --> 00:12:05,960
a meeting of the American Geophysical Union in 2018.

148
00:12:05,960 --> 00:12:12,540
It shows that this supposed pyramid is indeed an extinct volcano, a natural hill with terraces

149
00:12:12,540 --> 00:12:16,880
cut near the top, just as archaeologists had always said.

150
00:12:16,880 --> 00:12:20,840
There's no way for Hancock to get around this embarrassing discovery.

151
00:12:20,840 --> 00:12:24,280
Unless of course he changes the definition of a pyramid.

152
00:12:24,280 --> 00:12:25,280
Which of course he does.

153
00:12:25,280 --> 00:12:28,720
There's a question of definitions here, how do we define a pyramid, but if we define it

154
00:12:28,720 --> 00:12:33,960
as a structure that rises in a series of terraces to a summit, that's what we're looking at.

155
00:12:33,960 --> 00:12:40,560
Well no, I don't define a pyramid as a series of terraces to a summit in a natural hill,

156
00:12:40,560 --> 00:12:45,560
otherwise there are pyramids all over East Asia, and other parts of Indonesia come to

157
00:12:45,560 --> 00:12:46,560
that.

158
00:12:46,640 --> 00:12:52,120
Hancock not only redefines the pyramid, but he also scales back his illustrations.

159
00:12:52,120 --> 00:12:57,680
Just a few years ago, this was what his pyramid supposedly looked like, based on...

160
00:12:57,680 --> 00:13:00,560
Based on the very solid science and archaeological work.

161
00:13:00,560 --> 00:13:03,800
But in the Netflix film, it's been scaled back.

162
00:13:03,800 --> 00:13:09,140
Even with artistic embellishments and a bit of imagination added, it's clearly a natural

163
00:13:09,140 --> 00:13:12,580
hill with a megalithic site on top.

164
00:13:12,580 --> 00:13:17,820
Even the archaeologist Hancock interviews Ali Akbar, who by the way also wants to believe

165
00:13:17,820 --> 00:13:23,420
that Indonesia is an ancient civilisation, confirms that what we see on the hill, all

166
00:13:23,420 --> 00:13:31,340
of this, is a megalithic site about 2,500 years old, and he tells Hancock that.

167
00:13:31,340 --> 00:13:35,820
So now comes the job of making the audience believe there must be something inside the

168
00:13:35,820 --> 00:13:39,660
hill, and watch carefully how he does it.

169
00:13:39,660 --> 00:13:45,180
Next we hear Dr Akbar explain that just below the surface, his team uncovered artefacts

170
00:13:45,180 --> 00:13:51,820
dating back to around 7,200 years ago, suggesting that humans had visited the site that far

171
00:13:51,820 --> 00:13:53,180
back.

172
00:13:53,180 --> 00:13:56,100
And Hancock initially reports this correctly.

173
00:13:56,100 --> 00:14:01,580
They quickly found evidence that humans had been present in what's called a cultural

174
00:14:01,580 --> 00:14:02,580
left.

175
00:14:02,580 --> 00:14:05,900
That's right, evidence that humans had been present.

176
00:14:05,900 --> 00:14:11,260
Hardly surprising in an area where hunter-gatherers would have roamed 7,000 years ago, and no

177
00:14:11,260 --> 00:14:14,740
doubt occasionally camped on top of the hill.

178
00:14:14,740 --> 00:14:18,640
But then Hancock very subtly switches the dates.

179
00:14:18,640 --> 00:14:24,980
He turns the humans, who were here 7,200 years ago, into the builders of a site that he's

180
00:14:24,980 --> 00:14:35,040
just been told is about 2,500 years ago, and the reason no one notices the switch is because

181
00:14:35,040 --> 00:14:55,900
he slips it into a question.

182
00:14:55,900 --> 00:15:01,480
The audience is so busy pondering the question, they don't notice that Hancock has just introduced

183
00:15:01,480 --> 00:15:05,920
not one, but two fallacies into the question.

184
00:15:05,920 --> 00:15:11,160
The first is that all the blocks were brought here, the second is that it was done 7,000

185
00:15:11,160 --> 00:15:12,160
years ago.

186
00:15:12,160 --> 00:15:17,280
I wish I could say that Hancock is a genius at this kind of manipulation, but in fact

187
00:15:17,280 --> 00:15:19,960
it's a very old technique.

188
00:15:19,960 --> 00:15:24,280
Journalists and salesmen use it all the time, so do advertisers.

189
00:15:24,280 --> 00:15:29,760
They don't advertise UK lottery tickets by giving you important and relevant information,

190
00:15:29,760 --> 00:15:34,480
like the fact that only about half the money people spend on lottery tickets actually gets

191
00:15:34,480 --> 00:15:38,960
returned as prizes, or the fact that your chance of winning the jackpot is around one

192
00:15:38,960 --> 00:15:41,000
in 45 million.

193
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:46,560
They have to ignore inconvenient facts and instead feed your imagination.

194
00:15:46,560 --> 00:15:52,160
And the best way to do that is to ask, what would you do if you won?

195
00:15:52,160 --> 00:15:57,480
And even the implicit if you won is either subdued or completely omitted, because we

196
00:15:57,480 --> 00:16:02,160
have to turn this improbability into something people believe could be real.

197
00:16:02,160 --> 00:16:04,160
What would I do if I won Lotto?

198
00:16:04,160 --> 00:16:06,160
I'd play 18 holes at Glen Eagles.

199
00:16:06,160 --> 00:16:08,160
I'd really love to see the Northern Lights.

200
00:16:08,160 --> 00:16:12,160
If I won Lotto, I'd get myself a house with my own pool.

201
00:16:12,160 --> 00:16:14,300
Lotto, what would you do?

202
00:16:14,300 --> 00:16:18,720
Having given this impression that all these stones were physically carried to the site,

203
00:16:18,720 --> 00:16:20,680
Hancock then reinforces it.

204
00:16:20,680 --> 00:16:26,760
Only one of these blocks, up to 50,000 of them, and each weighing up to a third of a

205
00:16:26,760 --> 00:16:29,560
tonne, were carried up this hill.

206
00:16:29,560 --> 00:16:32,840
Even the experts Hancock spoke to don't make that claim.

207
00:16:32,840 --> 00:16:37,760
Again, the columns are perfectly natural and they're found scattered naturally at Gunung

208
00:16:37,760 --> 00:16:41,880
Padang, just as they are at Detonata Goalla.

209
00:16:41,880 --> 00:16:44,760
And also here at the Devil's Post pile in California.

210
00:16:44,760 --> 00:16:49,720
They're the result of cooling joints, weathering and collapsing.

211
00:16:49,960 --> 00:16:54,960
According to a paper published by the University of Geneva, some of the stones had been transported

212
00:16:54,960 --> 00:16:57,700
and they were used for the stairway.

213
00:16:57,700 --> 00:17:02,880
They were brought from 300 metres away from the Sakuta River and others a little further

214
00:17:02,880 --> 00:17:04,800
down the valley.

215
00:17:04,800 --> 00:17:11,680
Not an impossible feat even for hunter-gatherers, let alone Iron Age people from 500BC.

216
00:17:11,680 --> 00:17:17,080
There are dozens of examples of monuments being built around that time and even older,

217
00:17:17,080 --> 00:17:21,480
not just in Indonesia but all over South East Asia.

218
00:17:21,480 --> 00:17:27,440
Sometimes we know exactly how they were moved because the practice continued until recently.

219
00:17:27,440 --> 00:17:29,840
Sometimes we know how they could have been moved.

220
00:17:29,840 --> 00:17:36,680
All it takes is organisation, manpower, a few simple tools and lots of rope.

221
00:17:36,680 --> 00:17:42,300
So there's really no mystery in how people from 2500 years ago could have rearranged

222
00:17:42,300 --> 00:17:47,620
columnar joints they found naturally scattered on top of Gunung Padang.

223
00:17:47,620 --> 00:17:50,160
And that's the problem for Hancock.

224
00:17:50,160 --> 00:17:56,380
Because his books and his films depend on a mystery that he steps in to solve.

225
00:17:56,380 --> 00:17:59,500
So he has to manufacture one.

226
00:17:59,500 --> 00:18:04,500
Now all we need is another manufactured mystery to push the date back even further.

227
00:18:04,500 --> 00:18:05,620
And here it is.

228
00:18:05,620 --> 00:18:08,740
Natui Jaja has found something inside the hill.

229
00:18:08,740 --> 00:18:09,740
There's a void.

230
00:18:09,740 --> 00:18:11,380
Yes, there's a void.

231
00:18:11,380 --> 00:18:14,220
Wouldn't that be accompanied by a dramatic heartbeat?

232
00:18:14,220 --> 00:18:16,020
There's a void.

233
00:18:16,020 --> 00:18:17,020
That's better.

234
00:18:17,020 --> 00:18:24,360
What Dr. Hillman and his team have discovered are at least three large rectangular chambers.

235
00:18:24,360 --> 00:18:29,420
One around 10 metres down, perhaps an entrance hall of some kind.

236
00:18:29,420 --> 00:18:35,660
It seems to have an access tunnel leading to a larger main chamber and another passage

237
00:18:35,660 --> 00:18:37,180
connecting to a third chamber.

238
00:18:37,180 --> 00:18:41,740
OK, hold the image you've just made in your head, visualising the inside of these

239
00:18:41,740 --> 00:18:44,020
large rectangular chambers.

240
00:18:44,020 --> 00:18:47,900
I'm guessing it's something like this, right?

241
00:18:47,900 --> 00:18:52,180
But look how quickly the programme has taken us on a journey of the mind just by slipping

242
00:18:52,180 --> 00:18:54,280
in a few trigger words.

243
00:18:54,280 --> 00:19:01,360
From low velocity zone, to void, to chamber, to a large rectangular chamber, to an entrance

244
00:19:01,360 --> 00:19:04,420
hall reinforced by an artist's imagination.

245
00:19:04,420 --> 00:19:08,820
Boy, you're going to be so disappointed when you see what these chambers actually

246
00:19:08,820 --> 00:19:10,700
look like.

247
00:19:10,700 --> 00:19:11,700
Here they are.

248
00:19:11,700 --> 00:19:17,720
They're just amorphous, low density anomalies on the tomographic readouts.

249
00:19:17,720 --> 00:19:22,540
The reason they show up as different colours is because of the different methods of tomography

250
00:19:22,540 --> 00:19:23,860
used.

251
00:19:23,860 --> 00:19:29,280
Only one looks vaguely rectangular in two dimensions at an angle not very conducive

252
00:19:29,280 --> 00:19:31,140
to standing upright.

253
00:19:31,140 --> 00:19:34,900
The rest are all different shapes and orientations.

254
00:19:34,900 --> 00:19:40,020
You can see that better if I outline the areas Natui Jaja has identified.

255
00:19:40,020 --> 00:19:45,140
These are all the shapes of the voids, though not on the same scale.

256
00:19:45,140 --> 00:19:50,220
Now as a geologist, when I hear about voids like this inside a volcano, my first thought

257
00:19:50,220 --> 00:19:54,820
is a very common geological feature called a lava tube.

258
00:19:54,820 --> 00:19:58,920
The surface cools quicker and forms a solid crust.

259
00:19:58,920 --> 00:20:04,920
The river of molten lava underneath pushes its way through, expanding the crust.

260
00:20:04,920 --> 00:20:10,040
When the lava has run out, you're left with hollow tubes like this.

261
00:20:10,040 --> 00:20:15,520
But Hancock never mentions lava tubes, because again that doesn't fit the image he's trying

262
00:20:15,520 --> 00:20:22,040
to feed you, and any doubts or ambiguities are disguised, like this question mark against

263
00:20:22,040 --> 00:20:28,360
the word chamber, which was in Natui Jaja's original poster but got airbrushed out for

264
00:20:28,360 --> 00:20:37,760
the Netflix film.

265
00:20:37,760 --> 00:20:40,880
On the contrary, it makes perfect sense.

266
00:20:40,880 --> 00:20:45,880
Volcanoes are exactly where you'd expect to find natural cavities.

267
00:20:45,880 --> 00:20:50,680
Once again, this is an example of Hancock manufacturing a mystery, proclaiming that

268
00:20:50,680 --> 00:20:55,600
archaeologists have no explanation for the mystery he's made up, and then proceeding

269
00:20:55,600 --> 00:20:59,620
to try to solve the made-up mystery himself.

270
00:20:59,620 --> 00:21:05,960
So is there anything in this volcano that does point to an ancient civilisation?

271
00:21:05,960 --> 00:21:08,480
Hancock has only one thing left to try.

272
00:21:08,480 --> 00:21:11,520
To put a date on this hill that's not a hill.

273
00:21:11,520 --> 00:21:13,680
Hold on, it is a hill, Graham.

274
00:21:13,680 --> 00:21:15,360
We've been through this already.

275
00:21:15,360 --> 00:21:20,760
You're not going to pretend it isn't a hill, either by redefining the word pyramid or putting

276
00:21:20,760 --> 00:21:23,200
the word not into the script.

277
00:21:23,200 --> 00:21:26,360
OK, let's continue putting a date on this hill.

278
00:21:26,360 --> 00:21:31,520
Oh, and see if you can spot the four trigger words that Hancock slips in here, to turn

279
00:21:31,520 --> 00:21:35,760
a rather ordinary dating result into yet another mystery.

280
00:21:35,760 --> 00:21:41,760
Dr Hillman and his team turned to another geological tool.

281
00:21:41,760 --> 00:21:42,760
Core drilling.

282
00:21:42,760 --> 00:21:48,800
Going further down, around 100 feet or so, he hit the earliest layer of construction.

283
00:21:48,800 --> 00:21:51,480
Let's try and put dates on when this was shaped.

284
00:21:51,480 --> 00:21:52,840
Did you spot them?

285
00:21:52,840 --> 00:21:54,480
Here they are in caps.

286
00:21:54,480 --> 00:22:00,880
Hancock is feeding us cues to imagine columns that have been laid out, and constructed,

287
00:22:00,880 --> 00:22:02,460
and shaped.

288
00:22:02,460 --> 00:22:05,600
But where is the evidence for that?

289
00:22:05,600 --> 00:22:09,500
All the drill brought up were lumps of soil and pieces of rock.

290
00:22:09,500 --> 00:22:15,520
There are no artefacts, no inscriptions, no carvings, no evidence of construction or shaping

291
00:22:15,520 --> 00:22:18,120
or anything being laid out.

292
00:22:18,120 --> 00:22:22,440
Unless there was, you can bet Hancock would be proudly showing it off.

293
00:22:22,440 --> 00:22:26,440
Denny's findings are utterly extraordinary and bewildering.

294
00:22:26,440 --> 00:22:28,200
Well, not really.

295
00:22:28,200 --> 00:22:33,240
Nutterwey Judger drilled down into a volcanic hill and came up with samples of volcanic

296
00:22:33,240 --> 00:22:34,360
rock.

297
00:22:34,360 --> 00:22:36,960
It says so in his Core Log.

298
00:22:36,960 --> 00:22:38,120
Read it.

299
00:22:38,120 --> 00:22:44,920
Fragments of columnar joints, basaltic andesite rock, and fresh, massive, fractured basaltic

300
00:22:44,920 --> 00:22:50,640
andesite rocks, which is as unremarkable as putting a spoon into a trifle and coming

301
00:22:50,640 --> 00:22:52,240
up with jello.

302
00:22:52,240 --> 00:22:55,600
Not one piece of evidence of human manipulation.

303
00:22:55,600 --> 00:23:01,240
Those drill cores were pulling out dateable materials that dated way back as far as 24,000

304
00:23:01,240 --> 00:23:02,320
years ago.

305
00:23:02,320 --> 00:23:05,360
But what is that dateable material?

306
00:23:05,360 --> 00:23:10,420
According to Nutterwey Judger, who documents the dating results in his poster, it's just

307
00:23:10,420 --> 00:23:14,200
natural soil from 10 metres down.

308
00:23:14,200 --> 00:23:19,240
But that's hardly a surprise because the further you go down into any soil, the older

309
00:23:19,240 --> 00:23:20,920
it is.

310
00:23:20,920 --> 00:23:25,520
Notwithstanding leaching and other problems associated with dating soils, if you drill

311
00:23:25,520 --> 00:23:31,520
down to a layer of soil that's 24,000 years old anywhere in the world, you'll get organic

312
00:23:31,520 --> 00:23:35,520
material that dates to 24,000 years ago.

313
00:23:35,520 --> 00:23:39,940
It doesn't mean there's a lost civilisation down there.

314
00:23:39,940 --> 00:23:44,500
But at least we now know how Hancock came up with the claim, shown at the beginning

315
00:23:44,500 --> 00:23:50,560
of his video, that this extinct volcano is a 20,000 year old pyramid.

316
00:23:50,560 --> 00:23:54,860
And it can be done with any megalithic site with terraces.

317
00:23:54,860 --> 00:23:59,140
First define a pyramid as any hill with terraces at the top.

318
00:23:59,140 --> 00:24:03,540
Then drill down until you get to soil that's 20,000 years old.

319
00:24:03,540 --> 00:24:07,060
And voila, you've manufactured a mystery.

320
00:24:07,060 --> 00:24:11,340
Slip it into a question to divert audience attention.

321
00:24:11,340 --> 00:24:15,300
Why is there a 20,000 year old pyramid in Indonesia?

322
00:24:15,300 --> 00:24:20,060
Towards the end of that first episode, Hancock moves to another place where volcanic columns

323
00:24:20,060 --> 00:24:24,500
were used in construction at Nan Madol in Micronesia.

324
00:24:24,500 --> 00:24:30,060
Archaeologists believe most of the construction visible at Nan Madol today dates to around

325
00:24:30,060 --> 00:24:36,260
900 years ago when the blocks were quarried at a neighbouring island.

326
00:24:36,260 --> 00:24:42,020
But during my explorations on previous visits, I found several of its megalithic pillars

327
00:24:42,020 --> 00:24:48,960
extending out below the waterline, suggesting that earlier versions may have been constructed

328
00:24:48,960 --> 00:24:52,820
when sea levels were lower during the last ice age.

329
00:24:52,820 --> 00:24:57,940
Or it suggests that Hancock has rushed to judgement in claiming these are megalithic

330
00:24:57,940 --> 00:25:03,260
pillars, without bothering to check whether they actually are.

331
00:25:03,260 --> 00:25:08,220
But anyway, first, what image do you have in your head, what impression of events, based

332
00:25:08,220 --> 00:25:10,340
on Hancock's story?

333
00:25:10,340 --> 00:25:15,420
Narrow minded archaeologists developed a fixed idea about the construction based on what

334
00:25:15,420 --> 00:25:17,240
they see on land.

335
00:25:17,240 --> 00:25:22,860
But then Hancock went underwater and discovered pillars that could be much, much older, thus

336
00:25:22,860 --> 00:25:26,500
challenging their dogmatic conclusion.

337
00:25:26,500 --> 00:25:30,020
Archaeologist nil, Hancock won, right?

338
00:25:30,020 --> 00:25:34,380
OK, perhaps you're having second thoughts about forming that impression, because you

339
00:25:34,380 --> 00:25:39,540
know that of course I'm now going to blow this bullshit apart.

340
00:25:39,540 --> 00:25:43,540
First Hancock implies that he found the underwater pillars.

341
00:25:43,540 --> 00:25:49,500
But in fact they'd been found about 20 years earlier by an archaeologist called Arthur

342
00:25:49,500 --> 00:25:52,860
Sacks from Ohio State University.

343
00:25:52,860 --> 00:25:59,320
And another archaeological team in 1988 and 1989 had investigated them further.

344
00:25:59,320 --> 00:26:03,320
But neither gets a mention in the Netflix programme, because that doesn't fit the

345
00:26:03,320 --> 00:26:09,160
image of archaeologists as narrow minded buffoons who never look outside the obvious.

346
00:26:09,160 --> 00:26:14,220
It has to be Hancock, the visionary free thinker, who takes the initiative to dive into the

347
00:26:14,220 --> 00:26:18,000
water and find these pillars himself.

348
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:23,480
But when he supposedly found these man made pillars in 1998, Hancock must have already

349
00:26:23,480 --> 00:26:27,160
known that they were almost certainly not man made.

350
00:26:27,160 --> 00:26:30,680
They're made of natural coral.

351
00:26:30,680 --> 00:26:35,400
Years earlier a team from the University of Oregon had drilled 20 centimetres into several

352
00:26:35,400 --> 00:26:38,920
of the pillars and only found coral.

353
00:26:38,920 --> 00:26:43,880
Then they raised one of the pillars to the surface, cut it open and confirmed it was

354
00:26:43,880 --> 00:26:49,200
entirely made of coral and therefore entirely natural.

355
00:26:49,200 --> 00:26:54,120
But the entire story we're about to hear is dependent on these underwater columns being

356
00:26:54,120 --> 00:27:04,480
man made stone pillars, so Hancock completely ignores the archaeologists' findings.

357
00:27:04,480 --> 00:27:09,920
Well those architects lived about 2500 years ago, so who knows.

358
00:27:09,920 --> 00:27:15,840
Of course Hancock's referring to his imaginary ice age civilisation that he believes built

359
00:27:15,840 --> 00:27:20,920
an imaginary structure inside the volcano 20,000 years ago.

360
00:27:20,920 --> 00:27:26,080
Despite having no evidence for their existence, he now has them getting into boats and sailing

361
00:27:26,080 --> 00:27:32,540
thousands of miles across the open ocean to raise stones on a remote Pacific island.

362
00:27:32,540 --> 00:27:37,360
But if these pillars under the water at Nan Madol are just coral, then there's no man

363
00:27:37,360 --> 00:27:42,760
made construction under the water, and with no man made construction under the water,

364
00:27:42,760 --> 00:27:45,960
then there's no ice age civilisation there.

365
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:51,640
And with no ice age civilisation at Nan Madol, then there was no voyage across the Pacific,

366
00:27:51,640 --> 00:27:58,320
which means this whole elaborate train of speculation comes crashing down.

367
00:27:58,320 --> 00:28:02,640
But anyway the audience doesn't know any of this and there's no time to think, they're

368
00:28:02,640 --> 00:28:07,680
already focused on the mystery of what happened to this ice age civilisation.

369
00:28:07,680 --> 00:28:10,660
And if so, what happened to them?

370
00:28:10,660 --> 00:28:16,240
Having manufactured this phony mystery, Hancock steps in as the only person who can provide

371
00:28:16,240 --> 00:28:17,240
an answer.

372
00:28:17,240 --> 00:28:23,400
Well I believe it has something to do with what happened around 12,800 years ago.

373
00:28:23,400 --> 00:28:30,020
What happened 12,800 years ago was an event called the Younger Dryas, a period when deglaciation

374
00:28:30,020 --> 00:28:35,260
suddenly went into reverse and the Earth rapidly cooled down again.

375
00:28:35,260 --> 00:28:38,940
Hancock calls the Younger Dryas a major cataclysm.

376
00:28:38,940 --> 00:28:45,020
As the ice sheets advanced, ecosystems changed and some large animals became extinct.

377
00:28:45,020 --> 00:28:49,420
And apparently Hancock had predicted all that back in 1995.

378
00:28:49,420 --> 00:28:54,140
To me in 1995 when I wrote Fingerprints of the Gods, but there was no compelling evidence

379
00:28:54,140 --> 00:28:55,420
for a global cataclysm then.

380
00:28:55,420 --> 00:28:58,560
But of course there was compelling evidence back then.

381
00:28:58,560 --> 00:29:02,420
The Younger Dryas has been known about for 120 years.

382
00:29:03,180 --> 00:29:07,740
Hypotheses for what caused it have varied from the breach of an ice dam, sending trillions

383
00:29:07,740 --> 00:29:13,000
of tonnes of cold water into the Atlantic thermohaline circulation, to the hypothesis

384
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:18,780
of a comet impact, a major volcanic eruption or a shift in the jet stream.

385
00:29:18,780 --> 00:29:24,480
Hancock isn't a visionary who predicted this major cataclysm back in 1995.

386
00:29:24,480 --> 00:29:28,820
He knew about it because it was in every geology textbook.

387
00:29:28,820 --> 00:29:34,100
Well even I studied the Younger Dryas as far back as 1975.

388
00:29:34,100 --> 00:29:39,260
So let's see what sort of cataclysm Hancock thinks the Younger Dryas produced.

389
00:29:39,260 --> 00:29:43,900
First global temperatures plunge to the level that they were at the peak of the ice age

390
00:29:43,900 --> 00:29:47,140
and they do so almost literally overnight.

391
00:29:47,140 --> 00:29:48,640
No they didn't.

392
00:29:48,640 --> 00:29:54,840
The Younger Dryas began around 12,850 years ago and average global temperature fell to

393
00:29:54,880 --> 00:29:59,360
its lowest level around 12,700 years ago.

394
00:29:59,360 --> 00:30:02,820
That's a period of 150 years.

395
00:30:02,820 --> 00:30:08,080
Now you may say, but Hancock doesn't mean literally almost overnight.

396
00:30:08,080 --> 00:30:10,080
But yes, he does.

397
00:30:10,080 --> 00:30:15,340
Hancock specifically says almost literally overnight, because you need that image of

398
00:30:15,340 --> 00:30:20,320
a sudden plunge in temperature in order to build on what comes next.

399
00:30:20,320 --> 00:30:25,260
And secondly, there's a sudden and inexplicable rise in sea level.

400
00:30:25,260 --> 00:30:26,620
No there wasn't.

401
00:30:26,620 --> 00:30:31,640
Sea levels have been rising since the end of the glaciation as oceans warmed and ice

402
00:30:31,640 --> 00:30:32,640
melted.

403
00:30:32,640 --> 00:30:37,680
It had been going on for 7,000 years before the Younger Dryas and it continued during

404
00:30:37,680 --> 00:30:43,360
the Younger Dryas and it carried on for 5,000 years after the Younger Dryas.

405
00:30:43,360 --> 00:30:51,020
During 12,800 and 11,600 years ago, the oceans of the world rose dramatically in a series

406
00:30:51,020 --> 00:30:54,600
of immense deluges.

407
00:30:54,600 --> 00:30:55,880
No they didn't.

408
00:30:55,880 --> 00:31:00,960
But first, what do you imagine now that you've been fed trigger words like dramatically,

409
00:31:00,960 --> 00:31:03,080
immense and deluge?

410
00:31:03,080 --> 00:31:04,920
Something like this?

411
00:31:04,920 --> 00:31:10,740
This is the video Hancock actually shows in the programme to back up the words.

412
00:31:10,740 --> 00:31:14,540
But forget the images, let's concentrate on the figures.

413
00:31:14,540 --> 00:31:15,960
What period of time was that again?

414
00:31:15,960 --> 00:31:20,060
Between 12,800 and 11,600 years ago.

415
00:31:20,060 --> 00:31:22,780
But that's 1,200 years.

416
00:31:22,780 --> 00:31:25,460
And how much did sea level rise during that time?

417
00:31:25,460 --> 00:31:28,180
The oceans of the world rose dramatically.

418
00:31:28,180 --> 00:31:32,460
No dramatically isn't a number, it's just an image.

419
00:31:32,460 --> 00:31:35,780
Hancock doesn't give us a figure for good reason.

420
00:31:35,780 --> 00:31:42,060
During the timeline he cites, sea level rose around 17 metres, which is very dramatic,

421
00:31:42,060 --> 00:31:49,420
but over a 1,200 year time period that's about 14mm a year, just over half an inch.

422
00:31:49,420 --> 00:31:54,420
This epoch of immense floods would have traumatised all of humanity.

423
00:31:54,420 --> 00:31:57,080
No it wouldn't.

424
00:31:57,080 --> 00:32:04,220
The so-called great dramatically immense traumatising deluge didn't look so much like this, as

425
00:32:04,220 --> 00:32:05,220
this.

426
00:32:05,660 --> 00:32:10,020
If you stood on the beach at high tide during the Younger Dryas, then the immense deluge

427
00:32:10,020 --> 00:32:15,480
would probably have reached your ankles after about 6 years.

428
00:32:15,480 --> 00:32:20,260
Even if you doubled the rate of rise, it would still take 3 years for the water to reach

429
00:32:20,260 --> 00:32:21,260
your ankles.

430
00:32:21,260 --> 00:32:27,200
We've had an average global rise in sea level of around 60mm in the last 20 years,

431
00:32:27,200 --> 00:32:32,100
so hard to detect without instruments that a lot of people write into the channel saying

432
00:32:32,100 --> 00:32:34,660
they don't even believe it's happening.

433
00:32:34,660 --> 00:32:39,860
Why would a rise of half an inch a year during the Younger Dryas have been any more traumatising

434
00:32:39,860 --> 00:32:44,960
or noticeable than the same rise that had been going on for thousands of years before

435
00:32:44,960 --> 00:32:48,820
it and would continue for thousands of years afterwards?

436
00:32:48,820 --> 00:32:52,460
Hancock doesn't explain because he doesn't have to.

437
00:32:52,460 --> 00:32:57,420
His audience, the kind of people who buy his books, is completely unaware of the rate of

438
00:32:57,420 --> 00:33:00,660
sea level rise and he never tells them.

439
00:33:00,660 --> 00:33:06,220
He leaves it to trigger words and images to give an impression instead of explaining the

440
00:33:06,220 --> 00:33:07,980
facts.

441
00:33:07,980 --> 00:33:12,220
To be fair to Hancock, he makes no claim to be looking at the subject impartially.

442
00:33:12,220 --> 00:33:18,980
It's not my job to be balanced or objective, he writes, he's just providing a persuasive

443
00:33:18,980 --> 00:33:24,720
single-minded case for the existence of a lost civilisation to balance the history books

444
00:33:24,720 --> 00:33:29,860
and academics who do nothing but refine existing orthodoxy.

445
00:33:29,860 --> 00:33:35,480
But trying to be persuasive doesn't give Hancock the right to fabricate evidence, misrepresent

446
00:33:35,480 --> 00:33:39,880
findings and hide facts that contradict his beliefs.

447
00:33:39,880 --> 00:33:44,360
And how is it balancing the history books when most people have never read a history

448
00:33:44,360 --> 00:33:47,940
book on Gunung Padang or Nan Madol?

449
00:33:47,940 --> 00:33:51,740
All they know about these places is what Hancock tells them.

450
00:33:51,740 --> 00:33:56,200
And all they know about the conclusions of archaeologists about these places is what

451
00:33:56,200 --> 00:33:57,860
Hancock makes up.

452
00:33:57,860 --> 00:34:02,740
Neither two archaeologists had regarded it as a long-established fact that no large-scale

453
00:34:02,740 --> 00:34:07,100
structures were built anywhere in Southeast Asia until around 4000 years ago.

454
00:34:07,100 --> 00:34:12,820
I was curious as to why so many people swallow whatever Hancock tells them without question.

455
00:34:12,820 --> 00:34:16,940
Looking at the comments on the video of his Joe Rogan interview, some of his fans are

456
00:34:16,940 --> 00:34:22,100
impressed with his eloquent speaking voice, his recall of information.

457
00:34:22,100 --> 00:34:27,060
Whether the information is real or made up doesn't seem to occur to them.

458
00:34:27,060 --> 00:34:31,340
The praises heaped on interviewers like Joe Rogan for sitting there and letting Hancock

459
00:34:31,340 --> 00:34:38,020
unleash all these claims without once critically questioning a single thing he says.

460
00:34:38,020 --> 00:34:42,960
It seems like heresy to question it because Hancock's giving his audience what they crave

461
00:34:42,960 --> 00:34:54,460
– lots and lots of supposed mysteries.

462
00:34:54,460 --> 00:34:57,860
To all the Hancock fans out there, I do get the appeal.

463
00:34:57,860 --> 00:35:04,040
And of course I would love these mysteries to be real and a lost civilisation discovered.

464
00:35:04,040 --> 00:35:09,460
It would be much more exciting if a cavity in a volcano was an ancient entrance hall

465
00:35:09,460 --> 00:35:12,780
rather than just a plain old lava tube.

466
00:35:12,780 --> 00:35:19,280
Or if this was part of a man-made construction rather than just a boring old pillar coral.

467
00:35:19,280 --> 00:35:20,620
No one's against that.

468
00:35:20,620 --> 00:35:23,740
Who doesn't want to find a lost civilisation?

469
00:35:23,740 --> 00:35:26,260
For that you need evidence.

470
00:35:26,260 --> 00:35:31,340
As Mick Astin said, at the end of the day what professionals want to find is what's

471
00:35:31,340 --> 00:35:33,260
actually there.

472
00:35:33,260 --> 00:35:38,200
If the only way to support this dream of what amateurs want to find is to fabricate imaginary

473
00:35:38,200 --> 00:35:44,140
evidence and ignore real evidence, then sorry of course no one in the archaeological community

474
00:35:44,140 --> 00:35:46,920
is going to take it seriously.

475
00:35:46,920 --> 00:35:51,420
So I would love to hear from Hancock fans to see what you think.

476
00:35:51,420 --> 00:35:55,840
Please don't just write comments saying my video is bullshit, or it's an ad hominem

477
00:35:55,840 --> 00:35:57,300
attack against Hancock.

478
00:35:57,300 --> 00:36:02,540
I'm not judging his eloquent speaking voice, his intelligence or his personality.

479
00:36:02,540 --> 00:36:07,920
I'm happy to agree with all the gushing praise of his personal qualities.

480
00:36:07,920 --> 00:36:14,220
What I'm concerned with are the fabrications and the omissions, so please address that.

481
00:36:14,220 --> 00:36:18,900
And if you think there really is evidence that Gunung Padang is a 20,000 year old pyramid,

482
00:36:18,900 --> 00:36:23,740
or that these pillars at Nan Madol are man-made, please post it.

483
00:36:23,740 --> 00:36:29,640
If you can't do that, and prefer to launch a tirade against my voice or my personality,

484
00:36:29,640 --> 00:36:30,640
please do so.

485
00:36:30,640 --> 00:36:34,480
I'll take that as an admission that you can't find fault with my critique.

486
00:36:34,480 --> 00:36:37,780
So having a go at me is the best you can do.

487
00:36:37,780 --> 00:36:43,280
It's ironic that Hancock accuses archaeologists of sticking rigidly to orthodox theory when

488
00:36:43,280 --> 00:36:48,260
in fact there have been huge changes in their understanding of our Paleolithic and Neolithic

489
00:36:48,260 --> 00:36:49,860
ancestors.

490
00:36:49,860 --> 00:36:55,500
New evidence and new discoveries is the way all sciences progress, not through beliefs

491
00:36:55,500 --> 00:36:58,960
and wishes, but through hard physical evidence.

492
00:36:58,960 --> 00:37:04,220
The image Hancock gives of orthodox archaeological theory, that hunter-gatherers suddenly settled

493
00:37:04,220 --> 00:37:10,000
down and became farmers and then built cities, has long been overturned.

494
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:15,140
Archaeologists discovered decades ago that hunter-gatherer societies were far from simple,

495
00:37:15,140 --> 00:37:19,840
and the line between hunter-gatherers and settled farmers is blurred.

496
00:37:19,840 --> 00:37:24,940
They were often both, and changed from one to the other as circumstances allowed over

497
00:37:24,940 --> 00:37:26,820
thousands of years.

498
00:37:26,820 --> 00:37:31,900
And far from being simple, they established trading routes, made art, and constructed

499
00:37:31,900 --> 00:37:35,220
gathering places and sacred sites.

500
00:37:35,220 --> 00:37:39,720
And archaeologists may have discovered the reason for the site at Gunung Padang.

501
00:37:39,720 --> 00:37:46,020
A 2008, un-peer-reviewed study by Darlan and Sittungkir found that when you strike

502
00:37:46,020 --> 00:37:51,220
some of these stones, the ones that are grouped together, they produce notes in harmony with

503
00:37:51,220 --> 00:37:58,300
F, G, D and A. That might have given the site spiritual significance.

504
00:37:58,300 --> 00:38:03,560
The authors hypothesise that over many years, people arranged the musical stones to be used

505
00:38:03,560 --> 00:38:08,860
as instruments, perhaps for spiritual or ceremonial purposes.

506
00:38:08,860 --> 00:38:13,960
It's only a hypothesis, but importantly, it's backed by actual evidence.

507
00:38:13,960 --> 00:38:20,080
And to me, reality based on evidence is always far more interesting than a belief based on

508
00:38:20,080 --> 00:38:22,420
fabrications.

509
00:38:22,420 --> 00:38:27,280
These new discoveries in archaeology weren't dreamed up by flying to famous landmarks around

510
00:38:27,280 --> 00:38:29,840
the world and making up stories.

511
00:38:29,840 --> 00:38:36,080
They have been made by archaeologists spending years, or even decades, in hot and dusty places

512
00:38:36,080 --> 00:38:39,280
digging up hard evidence out of the ground.

513
00:38:39,280 --> 00:38:47,460
By analysing seeds, by tracing DNA, by matching pottery and finding real, not imaginary, evidence

514
00:38:47,460 --> 00:38:49,580
of construction.

515
00:38:49,580 --> 00:38:55,540
And every day as a result of their efforts, we're learning something new about our past.

516
00:38:55,540 --> 00:39:04,200
And not one shred of evidence so far points to even a trace of an ice age civilisation.

517
00:39:04,200 --> 00:39:08,180
So it's not archaeologists who are sticking rigidly to fixed ideas.

518
00:39:08,180 --> 00:39:14,460
Ironically, it's Hancock who for 30 years has stuck to his unwavering belief in this

519
00:39:14,460 --> 00:39:17,720
imaginary ice age civilisation.

520
00:39:17,720 --> 00:39:22,740
Now I don't doubt his sincerity he really does believe it.

521
00:39:22,740 --> 00:39:28,640
So much so, that he's prepared to make up a host of fabrications to support it and airbrush

522
00:39:28,640 --> 00:39:30,840
out anything that contradicts it.

523
00:39:34,420 --> 00:39:38,820
My channel doesn't ask for money, and unlike most YouTubers, I don't make these videos

524
00:39:38,820 --> 00:39:40,900
for financial gain.

525
00:39:40,900 --> 00:39:45,140
But since people have frequently asked if they can contribute something, I've suggested

526
00:39:45,140 --> 00:39:49,100
they send money to an innovative charity called Health in Harmony.

527
00:39:49,100 --> 00:39:55,780
The model has resulted in 70% less deforestation in an important national park, saving over

528
00:39:55,780 --> 00:39:59,560
27 square kilometres of rainforest.

529
00:39:59,580 --> 00:40:05,500
The study also found that it's provided cheap medical services for over 28,000 people who

530
00:40:05,500 --> 00:40:10,180
would otherwise have been cutting down trees to pay for healthcare.

531
00:40:10,180 --> 00:40:15,620
The model is now being extended from the forests of Borneo to Madagascar and Amazonia, funded

532
00:40:15,620 --> 00:40:19,900
in large part by contributions from my subscribers.

533
00:40:19,900 --> 00:40:24,340
Details are in the video description, and my thanks to all those who've contributed.
