WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:04.780
of Ognung Padang. I realise that this is an artist's rendition of what it would look like.

00:04.780 --> 00:08.340
This is in Indonesia, tell me what this is. Yes, but it's based on the very solid science

00:08.340 --> 00:13.340
and archaeological work. Why is there a 20,000 year old pyramids in

00:13.340 --> 00:16.440
Indonesia? That's a very good question. The great pyramids

00:16.440 --> 00:24.020
of Egypt are 4,500 years old. The Mayan pyramids are less than 2,000 years old. So how did

00:24.020 --> 00:30.400
Graham Hancock manage to find a 20,000 year old pyramid in Indonesia?

00:30.400 --> 00:35.160
In this video we'll find the answer to that, and you won't believe how he did it. Well,

00:35.160 --> 00:40.000
maybe you will if you're familiar with Hancock's body of work. And please mirror this video

00:40.000 --> 00:45.440
because it could very soon get blocked. If you're a Graham Hancock fan and you think

00:45.440 --> 00:50.640
everyone else should open their minds enough to share his belief, here's a challenge.

00:50.640 --> 00:57.100
Will you open your mind enough to watch this video and see what Hancock missed and fabricated

00:57.100 --> 01:02.900
in his new Netflix series Ancient Apocalypse? Can't hurt, can it?

01:02.900 --> 01:08.220
There used to be a popular programme in the UK called Time Team with actor Tony Robinson,

01:08.220 --> 01:14.280
playing the non-scientist, reporting on various archaeological digs around Britain. In one

01:14.280 --> 01:20.100
programme they were investigating a geophysical anomaly believed to be an old Roman villa.

01:20.100 --> 01:25.760
But the bits of pottery and brick they dug up kept pointing to a medieval monastery instead.

01:25.760 --> 01:31.860
That's not what we want to find, said a disappointed Tony. Professor Mick Aston, who

01:31.860 --> 01:38.340
supervised the digs, had to patiently explain how archaeology works. What we want to find

01:38.340 --> 01:44.080
as archaeologists, he said, is the answer to whatever was here. And if it was a medieval

01:44.080 --> 01:48.640
monastery then we find what we find.

01:48.640 --> 01:53.900
And that's the difference between a professional scientist and an enthusiastic amateur. When

01:53.900 --> 01:59.860
it comes to answering questions about history, archaeologists want to find whatever is actually

01:59.860 --> 02:05.820
there. Because each piece of evidence, each discovery, however dull or disappointing it

02:05.820 --> 02:11.600
may be, fills in another piece of our jigsaw puzzle that starts to give a complete and

02:11.600 --> 02:15.140
accurate history of our species.

02:15.140 --> 02:20.840
The quest for lost civilisations has been a book and movie favourite for years. In the

02:20.840 --> 02:26.640
1970s, Erich von Daniken promoted the idea that aliens had come to Earth to teach ancient

02:26.640 --> 02:32.560
people how to build things. Once that fad had passed, Graham Hancock swiped von Daniken's

02:32.560 --> 02:38.040
book titles and the aliens became emissaries from a lost civilisation, wiped out about

02:38.040 --> 02:43.040
12,000 years ago. Who taught ancient people how to build things?

02:43.040 --> 02:47.140
The last thing we want to believe, it seems, is that our ancestors were smart enough to

02:47.140 --> 02:52.800
learn for themselves how to build these things over a long period of time. But if outside

02:52.800 --> 02:57.980
help is always needed, I wonder how Hancock's imaginary civilisation figured it all out

02:57.980 --> 03:08.220
on their own. And he's still searching because after 30 years of touring the world, Hancock

03:08.220 --> 03:15.160
still hasn't discovered a single town, or a burial site, or a boat, no writing, not

03:15.160 --> 03:21.400
even a garbage dump. Hancock's explanation is that this civilisation existed somewhere

03:21.400 --> 03:23.160
he doesn't go, like…

03:23.160 --> 03:27.560
One of them is the Amazon, another is the Sahara Desert, and then under the continental

03:27.560 --> 03:28.560
shells.

03:28.560 --> 03:32.920
And let's not forget buried under the ice of Antarctica, which he proposed in his book

03:32.920 --> 03:38.460
– Fingerprints of the Gods. But the one thing we know about this imaginary civilisation

03:38.460 --> 03:44.660
is that they were supposedly experts at building huge pyramids. But despite commercial and

03:44.660 --> 03:50.540
private planes flying all over these remote places, plus the advent of Google Earth, no

03:50.540 --> 03:55.860
one spotted a single one. Even Hancock hasn't bothered to spend some of the millions he

03:55.860 --> 04:02.900
made selling books and TV programmes to hire a private plane and look for his lost civilisation.

04:02.900 --> 04:07.520
The only place on Earth where we know for sure this pyramid-building civilisation did

04:07.520 --> 04:13.680
exist is in Hancock's head, because he'll be the first one to tell you that this isn't

04:13.680 --> 04:20.120
a fact, it's his belief. Which is fine. Where he comes into conflict with reality

04:20.120 --> 04:25.840
is where he claims he's found mysteries that support his belief. Hancock's ideas

04:25.840 --> 04:31.020
have been laid out in numerous books and TV shows, and now a Netflix series, thanks to

04:31.020 --> 04:35.600
whoever posted the message alerting me to it. I had intended to go through the whole

04:35.600 --> 04:41.080
series and see if I could spot any errors, but no kidding, by the time I got to the end

04:41.080 --> 04:48.120
of just the first episode I found so many fabrications, omissions and misrepresentations

04:48.120 --> 04:53.880
that I already had enough to fill this entire video, which turns out to be the longest I've

04:53.880 --> 04:55.920
ever made.

04:55.920 --> 05:00.140
Before we start, you need to understand that as well as copying von Tannachan's book

05:00.140 --> 05:06.660
titles, Hancock also follows von Tannachan's tried and tested modus operandi for leading

05:06.660 --> 05:13.620
an unsceptical audience, as we'll see throughout. And rule number one is, start by painting

05:13.620 --> 05:19.300
professional archaeologists as bumbling, dogmatic and baffled by whatever they find.

05:19.300 --> 05:24.740
Of course, this idea is upsetting to the so-called experts. The extremely defensive, arrogant

05:24.740 --> 05:29.440
and patronising attitude of mainstream academia. The initial evidence has utterly confounded

05:29.440 --> 05:34.080
mainstream archaeologists. Then step in as a persecuted visionary who

05:34.080 --> 05:38.400
dares to challenge them with innovative new ideas.

05:38.400 --> 05:43.480
The series kicks off at a megalithic site in Indonesia called Gunung Padang, and within

05:43.480 --> 05:49.100
a few minutes, Hancock is already softening up his audience with rule number one, portray

05:49.100 --> 05:53.760
archaeologists as a bunch of incompetence who wouldn't know a significant site if

05:53.780 --> 05:55.260
they tripped over it.

05:55.260 --> 06:01.760
For a long while, archaeologists thought it was just another hill in the jungle. But there was a problem with that view.

06:01.760 --> 06:08.060
Yes, there was a problem with that view. Hancock made it up. And there's no better evidence

06:08.060 --> 06:16.060
for that than Hancock himself. In a speech posted in 2018, Hancock's claim was qualified.

06:16.060 --> 06:22.060
For a very long time, it was thought to be just a natural hill.

06:22.060 --> 06:23.060
That's all?

06:23.360 --> 06:28.360
With an interesting megalithic site on top of it.

06:28.360 --> 06:35.480
Ah, yes, just an ordinary hill with a megalithic site on top of it. And in an earlier interview

06:35.480 --> 06:38.360
posted in 2016, he said this.

06:38.360 --> 06:42.360
For a very long time, people believed that it was just a natural hill.

06:42.360 --> 06:43.360
With?

06:43.360 --> 06:47.860
With an old, but not extremely old megalithic site on top of it.

06:47.860 --> 06:52.760
So clearly, Hancock knew that his claim in the Netflix film that archaeologists thought

06:52.760 --> 06:58.960
this was just another hill was nonsense. He made this up simply because it made archaeologists

06:58.960 --> 07:02.960
look stupid and it made him look smart.

07:02.960 --> 07:05.460
And there's no excuse for this fabrication either.

07:05.460 --> 07:10.060
At first sight, this open terrace could be mistaken for a natural formation of volcanic

07:10.060 --> 07:14.460
rock, which is why archaeologists were so slow to investigate it.

07:14.460 --> 07:19.820
But archaeologists didn't mistake it for a natural formation, as Hancock well knows.

07:19.820 --> 07:23.320
And he also knows they weren't slow to investigate it.

07:23.320 --> 07:28.620
Again, we have to go back to other statements Hancock made to show he knew that very well.

07:28.620 --> 07:33.120
It's a megalithic site that's been in plain view and was in fact first inspected by archaeologists

07:33.120 --> 07:34.620
as early as 1914.

07:34.620 --> 07:42.580
Yes, a megalithic site in plain view, not mistaken for a natural formation, and investigated

07:42.580 --> 07:48.860
as far back as 1914 when a Dutch archaeologist wrote a report about it.

07:48.900 --> 07:53.900
The site was forgotten about during the turmoil of World War II and the bitter war that ended

07:53.900 --> 08:01.140
Dutch colonial rule, but when three farmers rediscovered it in 1979, Indonesian archaeologists

08:01.140 --> 08:03.300
immediately investigated.

08:03.300 --> 08:09.340
Indonesia's National Research Centre of Archaeology issued a report on Gunung Padang

08:09.340 --> 08:15.840
in 1985. At that time, Hancock was writing a book about the AIDS epidemic.

08:15.840 --> 08:21.000
After the National Research Centre of Archaeology came studies and investigations by archaeologists

08:21.000 --> 08:26.680
from Indonesia's Directorate of Antiquities, the National Archaeological Research and Development

08:26.680 --> 08:30.660
Institute and the Bandung Archaeological Centre.

08:30.660 --> 08:36.320
So ironically, archaeologists took an interest in the site long before Hancock did.

08:36.320 --> 08:39.880
If you want to know what archaeologists really think, ask them.

08:39.880 --> 08:44.760
Don't get a summary of their investigations and conclusions from the guy whose success

08:44.760 --> 08:47.400
depends on discrediting them.

08:47.400 --> 08:53.040
They conclude that evidence shows Gunung Padang is an old extinct volcano into which at least

08:53.040 --> 08:58.160
five terraces have been cut near the top, one of which has a retaining wall.

08:58.160 --> 09:03.440
Rough enclosures and pavements have been laid out, as well as stairs up to the site, using

09:03.440 --> 09:08.480
readily available volcanic columns as building material.

09:08.480 --> 09:12.360
And it was built around 2,500 years ago.

09:12.380 --> 09:18.400
These hexagonal columns form when molten lava comes out of the volcano, cools quickly, shrinks

09:18.400 --> 09:23.560
and creates hexagonal cracks. Even Hancock accepts that.

09:23.560 --> 09:28.760
When they weather, they collapse, forming loosely scattered columnar joints.

09:28.760 --> 09:33.720
You can see loosely scattered columnar joints not only at Gunung Padang, but also other

09:33.720 --> 09:38.200
sites like Detunata Goala in Romania.

09:38.200 --> 09:43.200
But unlike Gunung Padang, they haven't been arranged in patterns and no terraces have

09:43.200 --> 09:45.000
been cut.

09:45.000 --> 09:51.560
There are dozens of megalithic sites in Indonesia, but Gunung Padang is the largest.

09:51.560 --> 09:56.240
After painting a picture of archaeologists as a bunch of nay-saying incompetence, Hancock

09:56.240 --> 10:02.720
interviews a geologist called Danny Natawijaja, who, for the purposes of his programme, represents

10:02.720 --> 10:04.040
the complete opposite.

10:04.040 --> 10:10.680
Dr Danny Hillman Natawijaja studied at Caltech, but now works for Indonesia's geotechnology

10:10.680 --> 10:12.160
research centre.

10:12.160 --> 10:15.800
So a professional, sober, competent geologist.

10:15.800 --> 10:19.880
Absolutely, Danny comes at this as a scientist. His interest is that.

10:19.880 --> 10:25.080
Yeah, good, someone who's completely impartial and only interested in the science, and what

10:25.080 --> 10:27.160
his scientific equipment tells him.

10:27.160 --> 10:32.240
They did ground penetrating radar, seismic tomography, electrical resistivity.

10:32.240 --> 10:37.720
Alright Graham, lots and lots of real and objective science. We get the point.

10:37.720 --> 10:42.920
There had been an archaeological team excavating the site since 2011.

10:42.920 --> 10:49.760
Then in 2013, Natawijaja independently started his own investigation using drills and ground

10:49.760 --> 10:51.880
penetrating radar.

10:51.880 --> 10:53.840
Hancock describes what happened next.

10:53.840 --> 10:58.880
An extraordinary new possibility began to force itself on the researchers.

10:58.880 --> 11:05.280
That they might be confronted by the work of a civilisation lost to history.

11:05.280 --> 11:10.000
But of course, this is a Hancock film, so things are not always as straightforward as

11:10.000 --> 11:12.560
the story we're being told.

11:12.560 --> 11:19.800
Natawijaja is indeed a geologist, a renowned seismologist, very competent in his own field,

11:19.800 --> 11:22.180
and here's one of his books.

11:22.180 --> 11:28.020
But he's also been a long-time proponent of the idea that Indonesia is the site of

11:28.020 --> 11:29.020
Atlantis.

11:29.020 --> 11:31.780
Yes, you heard that right.

11:31.780 --> 11:36.220
He's not only promoted the idea in print, he explained it to Graham Hancock in previous

11:36.220 --> 11:39.940
interviews as far back as 2014.

11:39.940 --> 11:45.660
So the idea of an ancient civilisation was hardly forced on Natawijaja. He'd already

11:45.660 --> 11:51.840
reached that conclusion long before he started his 2013 investigation.

11:51.840 --> 11:55.360
But none of that was mentioned in the Netflix programme.

11:55.360 --> 12:01.120
Natawijaja never published his findings, so all we can go on is a poster he showed at

12:01.120 --> 12:05.960
a meeting of the American Geophysical Union in 2018.

12:05.960 --> 12:12.540
It shows that this supposed pyramid is indeed an extinct volcano, a natural hill with terraces

12:12.540 --> 12:16.880
cut near the top, just as archaeologists had always said.

12:16.880 --> 12:20.840
There's no way for Hancock to get around this embarrassing discovery.

12:20.840 --> 12:24.280
Unless of course he changes the definition of a pyramid.

12:24.280 --> 12:25.280
Which of course he does.

12:25.280 --> 12:28.720
There's a question of definitions here, how do we define a pyramid, but if we define it

12:28.720 --> 12:33.960
as a structure that rises in a series of terraces to a summit, that's what we're looking at.

12:33.960 --> 12:40.560
Well no, I don't define a pyramid as a series of terraces to a summit in a natural hill,

12:40.560 --> 12:45.560
otherwise there are pyramids all over East Asia, and other parts of Indonesia come to

12:45.560 --> 12:46.560
that.

12:46.640 --> 12:52.120
Hancock not only redefines the pyramid, but he also scales back his illustrations.

12:52.120 --> 12:57.680
Just a few years ago, this was what his pyramid supposedly looked like, based on...

12:57.680 --> 13:00.560
Based on the very solid science and archaeological work.

13:00.560 --> 13:03.800
But in the Netflix film, it's been scaled back.

13:03.800 --> 13:09.140
Even with artistic embellishments and a bit of imagination added, it's clearly a natural

13:09.140 --> 13:12.580
hill with a megalithic site on top.

13:12.580 --> 13:17.820
Even the archaeologist Hancock interviews Ali Akbar, who by the way also wants to believe

13:17.820 --> 13:23.420
that Indonesia is an ancient civilisation, confirms that what we see on the hill, all

13:23.420 --> 13:31.340
of this, is a megalithic site about 2,500 years old, and he tells Hancock that.

13:31.340 --> 13:35.820
So now comes the job of making the audience believe there must be something inside the

13:35.820 --> 13:39.660
hill, and watch carefully how he does it.

13:39.660 --> 13:45.180
Next we hear Dr Akbar explain that just below the surface, his team uncovered artefacts

13:45.180 --> 13:51.820
dating back to around 7,200 years ago, suggesting that humans had visited the site that far

13:51.820 --> 13:53.180
back.

13:53.180 --> 13:56.100
And Hancock initially reports this correctly.

13:56.100 --> 14:01.580
They quickly found evidence that humans had been present in what's called a cultural

14:01.580 --> 14:02.580
left.

14:02.580 --> 14:05.900
That's right, evidence that humans had been present.

14:05.900 --> 14:11.260
Hardly surprising in an area where hunter-gatherers would have roamed 7,000 years ago, and no

14:11.260 --> 14:14.740
doubt occasionally camped on top of the hill.

14:14.740 --> 14:18.640
But then Hancock very subtly switches the dates.

14:18.640 --> 14:24.980
He turns the humans, who were here 7,200 years ago, into the builders of a site that he's

14:24.980 --> 14:35.040
just been told is about 2,500 years ago, and the reason no one notices the switch is because

14:35.040 --> 14:55.900
he slips it into a question.

14:55.900 --> 15:01.480
The audience is so busy pondering the question, they don't notice that Hancock has just introduced

15:01.480 --> 15:05.920
not one, but two fallacies into the question.

15:05.920 --> 15:11.160
The first is that all the blocks were brought here, the second is that it was done 7,000

15:11.160 --> 15:12.160
years ago.

15:12.160 --> 15:17.280
I wish I could say that Hancock is a genius at this kind of manipulation, but in fact

15:17.280 --> 15:19.960
it's a very old technique.

15:19.960 --> 15:24.280
Journalists and salesmen use it all the time, so do advertisers.

15:24.280 --> 15:29.760
They don't advertise UK lottery tickets by giving you important and relevant information,

15:29.760 --> 15:34.480
like the fact that only about half the money people spend on lottery tickets actually gets

15:34.480 --> 15:38.960
returned as prizes, or the fact that your chance of winning the jackpot is around one

15:38.960 --> 15:41.000
in 45 million.

15:41.000 --> 15:46.560
They have to ignore inconvenient facts and instead feed your imagination.

15:46.560 --> 15:52.160
And the best way to do that is to ask, what would you do if you won?

15:52.160 --> 15:57.480
And even the implicit if you won is either subdued or completely omitted, because we

15:57.480 --> 16:02.160
have to turn this improbability into something people believe could be real.

16:02.160 --> 16:04.160
What would I do if I won Lotto?

16:04.160 --> 16:06.160
I'd play 18 holes at Glen Eagles.

16:06.160 --> 16:08.160
I'd really love to see the Northern Lights.

16:08.160 --> 16:12.160
If I won Lotto, I'd get myself a house with my own pool.

16:12.160 --> 16:14.300
Lotto, what would you do?

16:14.300 --> 16:18.720
Having given this impression that all these stones were physically carried to the site,

16:18.720 --> 16:20.680
Hancock then reinforces it.

16:20.680 --> 16:26.760
Only one of these blocks, up to 50,000 of them, and each weighing up to a third of a

16:26.760 --> 16:29.560
tonne, were carried up this hill.

16:29.560 --> 16:32.840
Even the experts Hancock spoke to don't make that claim.

16:32.840 --> 16:37.760
Again, the columns are perfectly natural and they're found scattered naturally at Gunung

16:37.760 --> 16:41.880
Padang, just as they are at Detonata Goalla.

16:41.880 --> 16:44.760
And also here at the Devil's Post pile in California.

16:44.760 --> 16:49.720
They're the result of cooling joints, weathering and collapsing.

16:49.960 --> 16:54.960
According to a paper published by the University of Geneva, some of the stones had been transported

16:54.960 --> 16:57.700
and they were used for the stairway.

16:57.700 --> 17:02.880
They were brought from 300 metres away from the Sakuta River and others a little further

17:02.880 --> 17:04.800
down the valley.

17:04.800 --> 17:11.680
Not an impossible feat even for hunter-gatherers, let alone Iron Age people from 500BC.

17:11.680 --> 17:17.080
There are dozens of examples of monuments being built around that time and even older,

17:17.080 --> 17:21.480
not just in Indonesia but all over South East Asia.

17:21.480 --> 17:27.440
Sometimes we know exactly how they were moved because the practice continued until recently.

17:27.440 --> 17:29.840
Sometimes we know how they could have been moved.

17:29.840 --> 17:36.680
All it takes is organisation, manpower, a few simple tools and lots of rope.

17:36.680 --> 17:42.300
So there's really no mystery in how people from 2500 years ago could have rearranged

17:42.300 --> 17:47.620
columnar joints they found naturally scattered on top of Gunung Padang.

17:47.620 --> 17:50.160
And that's the problem for Hancock.

17:50.160 --> 17:56.380
Because his books and his films depend on a mystery that he steps in to solve.

17:56.380 --> 17:59.500
So he has to manufacture one.

17:59.500 --> 18:04.500
Now all we need is another manufactured mystery to push the date back even further.

18:04.500 --> 18:05.620
And here it is.

18:05.620 --> 18:08.740
Natui Jaja has found something inside the hill.

18:08.740 --> 18:09.740
There's a void.

18:09.740 --> 18:11.380
Yes, there's a void.

18:11.380 --> 18:14.220
Wouldn't that be accompanied by a dramatic heartbeat?

18:14.220 --> 18:16.020
There's a void.

18:16.020 --> 18:17.020
That's better.

18:17.020 --> 18:24.360
What Dr. Hillman and his team have discovered are at least three large rectangular chambers.

18:24.360 --> 18:29.420
One around 10 metres down, perhaps an entrance hall of some kind.

18:29.420 --> 18:35.660
It seems to have an access tunnel leading to a larger main chamber and another passage

18:35.660 --> 18:37.180
connecting to a third chamber.

18:37.180 --> 18:41.740
OK, hold the image you've just made in your head, visualising the inside of these

18:41.740 --> 18:44.020
large rectangular chambers.

18:44.020 --> 18:47.900
I'm guessing it's something like this, right?

18:47.900 --> 18:52.180
But look how quickly the programme has taken us on a journey of the mind just by slipping

18:52.180 --> 18:54.280
in a few trigger words.

18:54.280 --> 19:01.360
From low velocity zone, to void, to chamber, to a large rectangular chamber, to an entrance

19:01.360 --> 19:04.420
hall reinforced by an artist's imagination.

19:04.420 --> 19:08.820
Boy, you're going to be so disappointed when you see what these chambers actually

19:08.820 --> 19:10.700
look like.

19:10.700 --> 19:11.700
Here they are.

19:11.700 --> 19:17.720
They're just amorphous, low density anomalies on the tomographic readouts.

19:17.720 --> 19:22.540
The reason they show up as different colours is because of the different methods of tomography

19:22.540 --> 19:23.860
used.

19:23.860 --> 19:29.280
Only one looks vaguely rectangular in two dimensions at an angle not very conducive

19:29.280 --> 19:31.140
to standing upright.

19:31.140 --> 19:34.900
The rest are all different shapes and orientations.

19:34.900 --> 19:40.020
You can see that better if I outline the areas Natui Jaja has identified.

19:40.020 --> 19:45.140
These are all the shapes of the voids, though not on the same scale.

19:45.140 --> 19:50.220
Now as a geologist, when I hear about voids like this inside a volcano, my first thought

19:50.220 --> 19:54.820
is a very common geological feature called a lava tube.

19:54.820 --> 19:58.920
The surface cools quicker and forms a solid crust.

19:58.920 --> 20:04.920
The river of molten lava underneath pushes its way through, expanding the crust.

20:04.920 --> 20:10.040
When the lava has run out, you're left with hollow tubes like this.

20:10.040 --> 20:15.520
But Hancock never mentions lava tubes, because again that doesn't fit the image he's trying

20:15.520 --> 20:22.040
to feed you, and any doubts or ambiguities are disguised, like this question mark against

20:22.040 --> 20:28.360
the word chamber, which was in Natui Jaja's original poster but got airbrushed out for

20:28.360 --> 20:37.760
the Netflix film.

20:37.760 --> 20:40.880
On the contrary, it makes perfect sense.

20:40.880 --> 20:45.880
Volcanoes are exactly where you'd expect to find natural cavities.

20:45.880 --> 20:50.680
Once again, this is an example of Hancock manufacturing a mystery, proclaiming that

20:50.680 --> 20:55.600
archaeologists have no explanation for the mystery he's made up, and then proceeding

20:55.600 --> 20:59.620
to try to solve the made-up mystery himself.

20:59.620 --> 21:05.960
So is there anything in this volcano that does point to an ancient civilisation?

21:05.960 --> 21:08.480
Hancock has only one thing left to try.

21:08.480 --> 21:11.520
To put a date on this hill that's not a hill.

21:11.520 --> 21:13.680
Hold on, it is a hill, Graham.

21:13.680 --> 21:15.360
We've been through this already.

21:15.360 --> 21:20.760
You're not going to pretend it isn't a hill, either by redefining the word pyramid or putting

21:20.760 --> 21:23.200
the word not into the script.

21:23.200 --> 21:26.360
OK, let's continue putting a date on this hill.

21:26.360 --> 21:31.520
Oh, and see if you can spot the four trigger words that Hancock slips in here, to turn

21:31.520 --> 21:35.760
a rather ordinary dating result into yet another mystery.

21:35.760 --> 21:41.760
Dr Hillman and his team turned to another geological tool.

21:41.760 --> 21:42.760
Core drilling.

21:42.760 --> 21:48.800
Going further down, around 100 feet or so, he hit the earliest layer of construction.

21:48.800 --> 21:51.480
Let's try and put dates on when this was shaped.

21:51.480 --> 21:52.840
Did you spot them?

21:52.840 --> 21:54.480
Here they are in caps.

21:54.480 --> 22:00.880
Hancock is feeding us cues to imagine columns that have been laid out, and constructed,

22:00.880 --> 22:02.460
and shaped.

22:02.460 --> 22:05.600
But where is the evidence for that?

22:05.600 --> 22:09.500
All the drill brought up were lumps of soil and pieces of rock.

22:09.500 --> 22:15.520
There are no artefacts, no inscriptions, no carvings, no evidence of construction or shaping

22:15.520 --> 22:18.120
or anything being laid out.

22:18.120 --> 22:22.440
Unless there was, you can bet Hancock would be proudly showing it off.

22:22.440 --> 22:26.440
Denny's findings are utterly extraordinary and bewildering.

22:26.440 --> 22:28.200
Well, not really.

22:28.200 --> 22:33.240
Nutterwey Judger drilled down into a volcanic hill and came up with samples of volcanic

22:33.240 --> 22:34.360
rock.

22:34.360 --> 22:36.960
It says so in his Core Log.

22:36.960 --> 22:38.120
Read it.

22:38.120 --> 22:44.920
Fragments of columnar joints, basaltic andesite rock, and fresh, massive, fractured basaltic

22:44.920 --> 22:50.640
andesite rocks, which is as unremarkable as putting a spoon into a trifle and coming

22:50.640 --> 22:52.240
up with jello.

22:52.240 --> 22:55.600
Not one piece of evidence of human manipulation.

22:55.600 --> 23:01.240
Those drill cores were pulling out dateable materials that dated way back as far as 24,000

23:01.240 --> 23:02.320
years ago.

23:02.320 --> 23:05.360
But what is that dateable material?

23:05.360 --> 23:10.420
According to Nutterwey Judger, who documents the dating results in his poster, it's just

23:10.420 --> 23:14.200
natural soil from 10 metres down.

23:14.200 --> 23:19.240
But that's hardly a surprise because the further you go down into any soil, the older

23:19.240 --> 23:20.920
it is.

23:20.920 --> 23:25.520
Notwithstanding leaching and other problems associated with dating soils, if you drill

23:25.520 --> 23:31.520
down to a layer of soil that's 24,000 years old anywhere in the world, you'll get organic

23:31.520 --> 23:35.520
material that dates to 24,000 years ago.

23:35.520 --> 23:39.940
It doesn't mean there's a lost civilisation down there.

23:39.940 --> 23:44.500
But at least we now know how Hancock came up with the claim, shown at the beginning

23:44.500 --> 23:50.560
of his video, that this extinct volcano is a 20,000 year old pyramid.

23:50.560 --> 23:54.860
And it can be done with any megalithic site with terraces.

23:54.860 --> 23:59.140
First define a pyramid as any hill with terraces at the top.

23:59.140 --> 24:03.540
Then drill down until you get to soil that's 20,000 years old.

24:03.540 --> 24:07.060
And voila, you've manufactured a mystery.

24:07.060 --> 24:11.340
Slip it into a question to divert audience attention.

24:11.340 --> 24:15.300
Why is there a 20,000 year old pyramid in Indonesia?

24:15.300 --> 24:20.060
Towards the end of that first episode, Hancock moves to another place where volcanic columns

24:20.060 --> 24:24.500
were used in construction at Nan Madol in Micronesia.

24:24.500 --> 24:30.060
Archaeologists believe most of the construction visible at Nan Madol today dates to around

24:30.060 --> 24:36.260
900 years ago when the blocks were quarried at a neighbouring island.

24:36.260 --> 24:42.020
But during my explorations on previous visits, I found several of its megalithic pillars

24:42.020 --> 24:48.960
extending out below the waterline, suggesting that earlier versions may have been constructed

24:48.960 --> 24:52.820
when sea levels were lower during the last ice age.

24:52.820 --> 24:57.940
Or it suggests that Hancock has rushed to judgement in claiming these are megalithic

24:57.940 --> 25:03.260
pillars, without bothering to check whether they actually are.

25:03.260 --> 25:08.220
But anyway, first, what image do you have in your head, what impression of events, based

25:08.220 --> 25:10.340
on Hancock's story?

25:10.340 --> 25:15.420
Narrow minded archaeologists developed a fixed idea about the construction based on what

25:15.420 --> 25:17.240
they see on land.

25:17.240 --> 25:22.860
But then Hancock went underwater and discovered pillars that could be much, much older, thus

25:22.860 --> 25:26.500
challenging their dogmatic conclusion.

25:26.500 --> 25:30.020
Archaeologist nil, Hancock won, right?

25:30.020 --> 25:34.380
OK, perhaps you're having second thoughts about forming that impression, because you

25:34.380 --> 25:39.540
know that of course I'm now going to blow this bullshit apart.

25:39.540 --> 25:43.540
First Hancock implies that he found the underwater pillars.

25:43.540 --> 25:49.500
But in fact they'd been found about 20 years earlier by an archaeologist called Arthur

25:49.500 --> 25:52.860
Sacks from Ohio State University.

25:52.860 --> 25:59.320
And another archaeological team in 1988 and 1989 had investigated them further.

25:59.320 --> 26:03.320
But neither gets a mention in the Netflix programme, because that doesn't fit the

26:03.320 --> 26:09.160
image of archaeologists as narrow minded buffoons who never look outside the obvious.

26:09.160 --> 26:14.220
It has to be Hancock, the visionary free thinker, who takes the initiative to dive into the

26:14.220 --> 26:18.000
water and find these pillars himself.

26:18.000 --> 26:23.480
But when he supposedly found these man made pillars in 1998, Hancock must have already

26:23.480 --> 26:27.160
known that they were almost certainly not man made.

26:27.160 --> 26:30.680
They're made of natural coral.

26:30.680 --> 26:35.400
Years earlier a team from the University of Oregon had drilled 20 centimetres into several

26:35.400 --> 26:38.920
of the pillars and only found coral.

26:38.920 --> 26:43.880
Then they raised one of the pillars to the surface, cut it open and confirmed it was

26:43.880 --> 26:49.200
entirely made of coral and therefore entirely natural.

26:49.200 --> 26:54.120
But the entire story we're about to hear is dependent on these underwater columns being

26:54.120 --> 27:04.480
man made stone pillars, so Hancock completely ignores the archaeologists' findings.

27:04.480 --> 27:09.920
Well those architects lived about 2500 years ago, so who knows.

27:09.920 --> 27:15.840
Of course Hancock's referring to his imaginary ice age civilisation that he believes built

27:15.840 --> 27:20.920
an imaginary structure inside the volcano 20,000 years ago.

27:20.920 --> 27:26.080
Despite having no evidence for their existence, he now has them getting into boats and sailing

27:26.080 --> 27:32.540
thousands of miles across the open ocean to raise stones on a remote Pacific island.

27:32.540 --> 27:37.360
But if these pillars under the water at Nan Madol are just coral, then there's no man

27:37.360 --> 27:42.760
made construction under the water, and with no man made construction under the water,

27:42.760 --> 27:45.960
then there's no ice age civilisation there.

27:46.000 --> 27:51.640
And with no ice age civilisation at Nan Madol, then there was no voyage across the Pacific,

27:51.640 --> 27:58.320
which means this whole elaborate train of speculation comes crashing down.

27:58.320 --> 28:02.640
But anyway the audience doesn't know any of this and there's no time to think, they're

28:02.640 --> 28:07.680
already focused on the mystery of what happened to this ice age civilisation.

28:07.680 --> 28:10.660
And if so, what happened to them?

28:10.660 --> 28:16.240
Having manufactured this phony mystery, Hancock steps in as the only person who can provide

28:16.240 --> 28:17.240
an answer.

28:17.240 --> 28:23.400
Well I believe it has something to do with what happened around 12,800 years ago.

28:23.400 --> 28:30.020
What happened 12,800 years ago was an event called the Younger Dryas, a period when deglaciation

28:30.020 --> 28:35.260
suddenly went into reverse and the Earth rapidly cooled down again.

28:35.260 --> 28:38.940
Hancock calls the Younger Dryas a major cataclysm.

28:38.940 --> 28:45.020
As the ice sheets advanced, ecosystems changed and some large animals became extinct.

28:45.020 --> 28:49.420
And apparently Hancock had predicted all that back in 1995.

28:49.420 --> 28:54.140
To me in 1995 when I wrote Fingerprints of the Gods, but there was no compelling evidence

28:54.140 --> 28:55.420
for a global cataclysm then.

28:55.420 --> 28:58.560
But of course there was compelling evidence back then.

28:58.560 --> 29:02.420
The Younger Dryas has been known about for 120 years.

29:03.180 --> 29:07.740
Hypotheses for what caused it have varied from the breach of an ice dam, sending trillions

29:07.740 --> 29:13.000
of tonnes of cold water into the Atlantic thermohaline circulation, to the hypothesis

29:13.000 --> 29:18.780
of a comet impact, a major volcanic eruption or a shift in the jet stream.

29:18.780 --> 29:24.480
Hancock isn't a visionary who predicted this major cataclysm back in 1995.

29:24.480 --> 29:28.820
He knew about it because it was in every geology textbook.

29:28.820 --> 29:34.100
Well even I studied the Younger Dryas as far back as 1975.

29:34.100 --> 29:39.260
So let's see what sort of cataclysm Hancock thinks the Younger Dryas produced.

29:39.260 --> 29:43.900
First global temperatures plunge to the level that they were at the peak of the ice age

29:43.900 --> 29:47.140
and they do so almost literally overnight.

29:47.140 --> 29:48.640
No they didn't.

29:48.640 --> 29:54.840
The Younger Dryas began around 12,850 years ago and average global temperature fell to

29:54.880 --> 29:59.360
its lowest level around 12,700 years ago.

29:59.360 --> 30:02.820
That's a period of 150 years.

30:02.820 --> 30:08.080
Now you may say, but Hancock doesn't mean literally almost overnight.

30:08.080 --> 30:10.080
But yes, he does.

30:10.080 --> 30:15.340
Hancock specifically says almost literally overnight, because you need that image of

30:15.340 --> 30:20.320
a sudden plunge in temperature in order to build on what comes next.

30:20.320 --> 30:25.260
And secondly, there's a sudden and inexplicable rise in sea level.

30:25.260 --> 30:26.620
No there wasn't.

30:26.620 --> 30:31.640
Sea levels have been rising since the end of the glaciation as oceans warmed and ice

30:31.640 --> 30:32.640
melted.

30:32.640 --> 30:37.680
It had been going on for 7,000 years before the Younger Dryas and it continued during

30:37.680 --> 30:43.360
the Younger Dryas and it carried on for 5,000 years after the Younger Dryas.

30:43.360 --> 30:51.020
During 12,800 and 11,600 years ago, the oceans of the world rose dramatically in a series

30:51.020 --> 30:54.600
of immense deluges.

30:54.600 --> 30:55.880
No they didn't.

30:55.880 --> 31:00.960
But first, what do you imagine now that you've been fed trigger words like dramatically,

31:00.960 --> 31:03.080
immense and deluge?

31:03.080 --> 31:04.920
Something like this?

31:04.920 --> 31:10.740
This is the video Hancock actually shows in the programme to back up the words.

31:10.740 --> 31:14.540
But forget the images, let's concentrate on the figures.

31:14.540 --> 31:15.960
What period of time was that again?

31:15.960 --> 31:20.060
Between 12,800 and 11,600 years ago.

31:20.060 --> 31:22.780
But that's 1,200 years.

31:22.780 --> 31:25.460
And how much did sea level rise during that time?

31:25.460 --> 31:28.180
The oceans of the world rose dramatically.

31:28.180 --> 31:32.460
No dramatically isn't a number, it's just an image.

31:32.460 --> 31:35.780
Hancock doesn't give us a figure for good reason.

31:35.780 --> 31:42.060
During the timeline he cites, sea level rose around 17 metres, which is very dramatic,

31:42.060 --> 31:49.420
but over a 1,200 year time period that's about 14mm a year, just over half an inch.

31:49.420 --> 31:54.420
This epoch of immense floods would have traumatised all of humanity.

31:54.420 --> 31:57.080
No it wouldn't.

31:57.080 --> 32:04.220
The so-called great dramatically immense traumatising deluge didn't look so much like this, as

32:04.220 --> 32:05.220
this.

32:05.660 --> 32:10.020
If you stood on the beach at high tide during the Younger Dryas, then the immense deluge

32:10.020 --> 32:15.480
would probably have reached your ankles after about 6 years.

32:15.480 --> 32:20.260
Even if you doubled the rate of rise, it would still take 3 years for the water to reach

32:20.260 --> 32:21.260
your ankles.

32:21.260 --> 32:27.200
We've had an average global rise in sea level of around 60mm in the last 20 years,

32:27.200 --> 32:32.100
so hard to detect without instruments that a lot of people write into the channel saying

32:32.100 --> 32:34.660
they don't even believe it's happening.

32:34.660 --> 32:39.860
Why would a rise of half an inch a year during the Younger Dryas have been any more traumatising

32:39.860 --> 32:44.960
or noticeable than the same rise that had been going on for thousands of years before

32:44.960 --> 32:48.820
it and would continue for thousands of years afterwards?

32:48.820 --> 32:52.460
Hancock doesn't explain because he doesn't have to.

32:52.460 --> 32:57.420
His audience, the kind of people who buy his books, is completely unaware of the rate of

32:57.420 --> 33:00.660
sea level rise and he never tells them.

33:00.660 --> 33:06.220
He leaves it to trigger words and images to give an impression instead of explaining the

33:06.220 --> 33:07.980
facts.

33:07.980 --> 33:12.220
To be fair to Hancock, he makes no claim to be looking at the subject impartially.

33:12.220 --> 33:18.980
It's not my job to be balanced or objective, he writes, he's just providing a persuasive

33:18.980 --> 33:24.720
single-minded case for the existence of a lost civilisation to balance the history books

33:24.720 --> 33:29.860
and academics who do nothing but refine existing orthodoxy.

33:29.860 --> 33:35.480
But trying to be persuasive doesn't give Hancock the right to fabricate evidence, misrepresent

33:35.480 --> 33:39.880
findings and hide facts that contradict his beliefs.

33:39.880 --> 33:44.360
And how is it balancing the history books when most people have never read a history

33:44.360 --> 33:47.940
book on Gunung Padang or Nan Madol?

33:47.940 --> 33:51.740
All they know about these places is what Hancock tells them.

33:51.740 --> 33:56.200
And all they know about the conclusions of archaeologists about these places is what

33:56.200 --> 33:57.860
Hancock makes up.

33:57.860 --> 34:02.740
Neither two archaeologists had regarded it as a long-established fact that no large-scale

34:02.740 --> 34:07.100
structures were built anywhere in Southeast Asia until around 4000 years ago.

34:07.100 --> 34:12.820
I was curious as to why so many people swallow whatever Hancock tells them without question.

34:12.820 --> 34:16.940
Looking at the comments on the video of his Joe Rogan interview, some of his fans are

34:16.940 --> 34:22.100
impressed with his eloquent speaking voice, his recall of information.

34:22.100 --> 34:27.060
Whether the information is real or made up doesn't seem to occur to them.

34:27.060 --> 34:31.340
The praises heaped on interviewers like Joe Rogan for sitting there and letting Hancock

34:31.340 --> 34:38.020
unleash all these claims without once critically questioning a single thing he says.

34:38.020 --> 34:42.960
It seems like heresy to question it because Hancock's giving his audience what they crave

34:42.960 --> 34:54.460
– lots and lots of supposed mysteries.

34:54.460 --> 34:57.860
To all the Hancock fans out there, I do get the appeal.

34:57.860 --> 35:04.040
And of course I would love these mysteries to be real and a lost civilisation discovered.

35:04.040 --> 35:09.460
It would be much more exciting if a cavity in a volcano was an ancient entrance hall

35:09.460 --> 35:12.780
rather than just a plain old lava tube.

35:12.780 --> 35:19.280
Or if this was part of a man-made construction rather than just a boring old pillar coral.

35:19.280 --> 35:20.620
No one's against that.

35:20.620 --> 35:23.740
Who doesn't want to find a lost civilisation?

35:23.740 --> 35:26.260
For that you need evidence.

35:26.260 --> 35:31.340
As Mick Astin said, at the end of the day what professionals want to find is what's

35:31.340 --> 35:33.260
actually there.

35:33.260 --> 35:38.200
If the only way to support this dream of what amateurs want to find is to fabricate imaginary

35:38.200 --> 35:44.140
evidence and ignore real evidence, then sorry of course no one in the archaeological community

35:44.140 --> 35:46.920
is going to take it seriously.

35:46.920 --> 35:51.420
So I would love to hear from Hancock fans to see what you think.

35:51.420 --> 35:55.840
Please don't just write comments saying my video is bullshit, or it's an ad hominem

35:55.840 --> 35:57.300
attack against Hancock.

35:57.300 --> 36:02.540
I'm not judging his eloquent speaking voice, his intelligence or his personality.

36:02.540 --> 36:07.920
I'm happy to agree with all the gushing praise of his personal qualities.

36:07.920 --> 36:14.220
What I'm concerned with are the fabrications and the omissions, so please address that.

36:14.220 --> 36:18.900
And if you think there really is evidence that Gunung Padang is a 20,000 year old pyramid,

36:18.900 --> 36:23.740
or that these pillars at Nan Madol are man-made, please post it.

36:23.740 --> 36:29.640
If you can't do that, and prefer to launch a tirade against my voice or my personality,

36:29.640 --> 36:30.640
please do so.

36:30.640 --> 36:34.480
I'll take that as an admission that you can't find fault with my critique.

36:34.480 --> 36:37.780
So having a go at me is the best you can do.

36:37.780 --> 36:43.280
It's ironic that Hancock accuses archaeologists of sticking rigidly to orthodox theory when

36:43.280 --> 36:48.260
in fact there have been huge changes in their understanding of our Paleolithic and Neolithic

36:48.260 --> 36:49.860
ancestors.

36:49.860 --> 36:55.500
New evidence and new discoveries is the way all sciences progress, not through beliefs

36:55.500 --> 36:58.960
and wishes, but through hard physical evidence.

36:58.960 --> 37:04.220
The image Hancock gives of orthodox archaeological theory, that hunter-gatherers suddenly settled

37:04.220 --> 37:10.000
down and became farmers and then built cities, has long been overturned.

37:10.000 --> 37:15.140
Archaeologists discovered decades ago that hunter-gatherer societies were far from simple,

37:15.140 --> 37:19.840
and the line between hunter-gatherers and settled farmers is blurred.

37:19.840 --> 37:24.940
They were often both, and changed from one to the other as circumstances allowed over

37:24.940 --> 37:26.820
thousands of years.

37:26.820 --> 37:31.900
And far from being simple, they established trading routes, made art, and constructed

37:31.900 --> 37:35.220
gathering places and sacred sites.

37:35.220 --> 37:39.720
And archaeologists may have discovered the reason for the site at Gunung Padang.

37:39.720 --> 37:46.020
A 2008, un-peer-reviewed study by Darlan and Sittungkir found that when you strike

37:46.020 --> 37:51.220
some of these stones, the ones that are grouped together, they produce notes in harmony with

37:51.220 --> 37:58.300
F, G, D and A. That might have given the site spiritual significance.

37:58.300 --> 38:03.560
The authors hypothesise that over many years, people arranged the musical stones to be used

38:03.560 --> 38:08.860
as instruments, perhaps for spiritual or ceremonial purposes.

38:08.860 --> 38:13.960
It's only a hypothesis, but importantly, it's backed by actual evidence.

38:13.960 --> 38:20.080
And to me, reality based on evidence is always far more interesting than a belief based on

38:20.080 --> 38:22.420
fabrications.

38:22.420 --> 38:27.280
These new discoveries in archaeology weren't dreamed up by flying to famous landmarks around

38:27.280 --> 38:29.840
the world and making up stories.

38:29.840 --> 38:36.080
They have been made by archaeologists spending years, or even decades, in hot and dusty places

38:36.080 --> 38:39.280
digging up hard evidence out of the ground.

38:39.280 --> 38:47.460
By analysing seeds, by tracing DNA, by matching pottery and finding real, not imaginary, evidence

38:47.460 --> 38:49.580
of construction.

38:49.580 --> 38:55.540
And every day as a result of their efforts, we're learning something new about our past.

38:55.540 --> 39:04.200
And not one shred of evidence so far points to even a trace of an ice age civilisation.

39:04.200 --> 39:08.180
So it's not archaeologists who are sticking rigidly to fixed ideas.

39:08.180 --> 39:14.460
Ironically, it's Hancock who for 30 years has stuck to his unwavering belief in this

39:14.460 --> 39:17.720
imaginary ice age civilisation.

39:17.720 --> 39:22.740
Now I don't doubt his sincerity he really does believe it.

39:22.740 --> 39:28.640
So much so, that he's prepared to make up a host of fabrications to support it and airbrush

39:28.640 --> 39:30.840
out anything that contradicts it.

39:34.420 --> 39:38.820
My channel doesn't ask for money, and unlike most YouTubers, I don't make these videos

39:38.820 --> 39:40.900
for financial gain.

39:40.900 --> 39:45.140
But since people have frequently asked if they can contribute something, I've suggested

39:45.140 --> 39:49.100
they send money to an innovative charity called Health in Harmony.

39:49.100 --> 39:55.780
The model has resulted in 70% less deforestation in an important national park, saving over

39:55.780 --> 39:59.560
27 square kilometres of rainforest.

39:59.580 --> 40:05.500
The study also found that it's provided cheap medical services for over 28,000 people who

40:05.500 --> 40:10.180
would otherwise have been cutting down trees to pay for healthcare.

40:10.180 --> 40:15.620
The model is now being extended from the forests of Borneo to Madagascar and Amazonia, funded

40:15.620 --> 40:19.900
in large part by contributions from my subscribers.

40:19.900 --> 40:24.340
Details are in the video description, and my thanks to all those who've contributed.
