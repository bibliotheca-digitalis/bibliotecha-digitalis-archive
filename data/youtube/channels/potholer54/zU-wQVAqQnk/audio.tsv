0	4780	of Ognung Padang. I realise that this is an artist's rendition of what it would look like.
4780	8340	This is in Indonesia, tell me what this is. Yes, but it's based on the very solid science
8340	13340	and archaeological work. Why is there a 20,000 year old pyramids in
13340	16440	Indonesia? That's a very good question. The great pyramids
16440	24020	of Egypt are 4,500 years old. The Mayan pyramids are less than 2,000 years old. So how did
24020	30400	Graham Hancock manage to find a 20,000 year old pyramid in Indonesia?
30400	35160	In this video we'll find the answer to that, and you won't believe how he did it. Well,
35160	40000	maybe you will if you're familiar with Hancock's body of work. And please mirror this video
40000	45440	because it could very soon get blocked. If you're a Graham Hancock fan and you think
45440	50640	everyone else should open their minds enough to share his belief, here's a challenge.
50640	57100	Will you open your mind enough to watch this video and see what Hancock missed and fabricated
57100	62900	in his new Netflix series Ancient Apocalypse? Can't hurt, can it?
62900	68220	There used to be a popular programme in the UK called Time Team with actor Tony Robinson,
68220	74280	playing the non-scientist, reporting on various archaeological digs around Britain. In one
74280	80100	programme they were investigating a geophysical anomaly believed to be an old Roman villa.
80100	85760	But the bits of pottery and brick they dug up kept pointing to a medieval monastery instead.
85760	91860	That's not what we want to find, said a disappointed Tony. Professor Mick Aston, who
91860	98340	supervised the digs, had to patiently explain how archaeology works. What we want to find
98340	104080	as archaeologists, he said, is the answer to whatever was here. And if it was a medieval
104080	108640	monastery then we find what we find.
108640	113900	And that's the difference between a professional scientist and an enthusiastic amateur. When
113900	119860	it comes to answering questions about history, archaeologists want to find whatever is actually
119860	125820	there. Because each piece of evidence, each discovery, however dull or disappointing it
125820	131600	may be, fills in another piece of our jigsaw puzzle that starts to give a complete and
131600	135140	accurate history of our species.
135140	140840	The quest for lost civilisations has been a book and movie favourite for years. In the
140840	146640	1970s, Erich von Daniken promoted the idea that aliens had come to Earth to teach ancient
146640	152560	people how to build things. Once that fad had passed, Graham Hancock swiped von Daniken's
152560	158040	book titles and the aliens became emissaries from a lost civilisation, wiped out about
158040	163040	12,000 years ago. Who taught ancient people how to build things?
163040	167140	The last thing we want to believe, it seems, is that our ancestors were smart enough to
167140	172800	learn for themselves how to build these things over a long period of time. But if outside
172800	177980	help is always needed, I wonder how Hancock's imaginary civilisation figured it all out
177980	188220	on their own. And he's still searching because after 30 years of touring the world, Hancock
188220	195160	still hasn't discovered a single town, or a burial site, or a boat, no writing, not
195160	201400	even a garbage dump. Hancock's explanation is that this civilisation existed somewhere
201400	203160	he doesn't go, like…
203160	207560	One of them is the Amazon, another is the Sahara Desert, and then under the continental
207560	208560	shells.
208560	212920	And let's not forget buried under the ice of Antarctica, which he proposed in his book
212920	218460	– Fingerprints of the Gods. But the one thing we know about this imaginary civilisation
218460	224660	is that they were supposedly experts at building huge pyramids. But despite commercial and
224660	230540	private planes flying all over these remote places, plus the advent of Google Earth, no
230540	235860	one spotted a single one. Even Hancock hasn't bothered to spend some of the millions he
235860	242900	made selling books and TV programmes to hire a private plane and look for his lost civilisation.
242900	247520	The only place on Earth where we know for sure this pyramid-building civilisation did
247520	253680	exist is in Hancock's head, because he'll be the first one to tell you that this isn't
253680	260120	a fact, it's his belief. Which is fine. Where he comes into conflict with reality
260120	265840	is where he claims he's found mysteries that support his belief. Hancock's ideas
265840	271020	have been laid out in numerous books and TV shows, and now a Netflix series, thanks to
271020	275600	whoever posted the message alerting me to it. I had intended to go through the whole
275600	281080	series and see if I could spot any errors, but no kidding, by the time I got to the end
281080	288120	of just the first episode I found so many fabrications, omissions and misrepresentations
288120	293880	that I already had enough to fill this entire video, which turns out to be the longest I've
293880	295920	ever made.
295920	300140	Before we start, you need to understand that as well as copying von Tannachan's book
300140	306660	titles, Hancock also follows von Tannachan's tried and tested modus operandi for leading
306660	313620	an unsceptical audience, as we'll see throughout. And rule number one is, start by painting
313620	319300	professional archaeologists as bumbling, dogmatic and baffled by whatever they find.
319300	324740	Of course, this idea is upsetting to the so-called experts. The extremely defensive, arrogant
324740	329440	and patronising attitude of mainstream academia. The initial evidence has utterly confounded
329440	334080	mainstream archaeologists. Then step in as a persecuted visionary who
334080	338400	dares to challenge them with innovative new ideas.
338400	343480	The series kicks off at a megalithic site in Indonesia called Gunung Padang, and within
343480	349100	a few minutes, Hancock is already softening up his audience with rule number one, portray
349100	353760	archaeologists as a bunch of incompetence who wouldn't know a significant site if
353780	355260	they tripped over it.
355260	361760	For a long while, archaeologists thought it was just another hill in the jungle. But there was a problem with that view.
361760	368060	Yes, there was a problem with that view. Hancock made it up. And there's no better evidence
368060	376060	for that than Hancock himself. In a speech posted in 2018, Hancock's claim was qualified.
376060	382060	For a very long time, it was thought to be just a natural hill.
382060	383060	That's all?
383360	388360	With an interesting megalithic site on top of it.
388360	395480	Ah, yes, just an ordinary hill with a megalithic site on top of it. And in an earlier interview
395480	398360	posted in 2016, he said this.
398360	402360	For a very long time, people believed that it was just a natural hill.
402360	403360	With?
403360	407860	With an old, but not extremely old megalithic site on top of it.
407860	412760	So clearly, Hancock knew that his claim in the Netflix film that archaeologists thought
412760	418960	this was just another hill was nonsense. He made this up simply because it made archaeologists
418960	422960	look stupid and it made him look smart.
422960	425460	And there's no excuse for this fabrication either.
425460	430060	At first sight, this open terrace could be mistaken for a natural formation of volcanic
430060	434460	rock, which is why archaeologists were so slow to investigate it.
434460	439820	But archaeologists didn't mistake it for a natural formation, as Hancock well knows.
439820	443320	And he also knows they weren't slow to investigate it.
443320	448620	Again, we have to go back to other statements Hancock made to show he knew that very well.
448620	453120	It's a megalithic site that's been in plain view and was in fact first inspected by archaeologists
453120	454620	as early as 1914.
454620	462580	Yes, a megalithic site in plain view, not mistaken for a natural formation, and investigated
462580	468860	as far back as 1914 when a Dutch archaeologist wrote a report about it.
468900	473900	The site was forgotten about during the turmoil of World War II and the bitter war that ended
473900	481140	Dutch colonial rule, but when three farmers rediscovered it in 1979, Indonesian archaeologists
481140	483300	immediately investigated.
483300	489340	Indonesia's National Research Centre of Archaeology issued a report on Gunung Padang
489340	495840	in 1985. At that time, Hancock was writing a book about the AIDS epidemic.
495840	501000	After the National Research Centre of Archaeology came studies and investigations by archaeologists
501000	506680	from Indonesia's Directorate of Antiquities, the National Archaeological Research and Development
506680	510660	Institute and the Bandung Archaeological Centre.
510660	516320	So ironically, archaeologists took an interest in the site long before Hancock did.
516320	519880	If you want to know what archaeologists really think, ask them.
519880	524760	Don't get a summary of their investigations and conclusions from the guy whose success
524760	527400	depends on discrediting them.
527400	533040	They conclude that evidence shows Gunung Padang is an old extinct volcano into which at least
533040	538160	five terraces have been cut near the top, one of which has a retaining wall.
538160	543440	Rough enclosures and pavements have been laid out, as well as stairs up to the site, using
543440	548480	readily available volcanic columns as building material.
548480	552360	And it was built around 2,500 years ago.
552380	558400	These hexagonal columns form when molten lava comes out of the volcano, cools quickly, shrinks
558400	563560	and creates hexagonal cracks. Even Hancock accepts that.
563560	568760	When they weather, they collapse, forming loosely scattered columnar joints.
568760	573720	You can see loosely scattered columnar joints not only at Gunung Padang, but also other
573720	578200	sites like Detunata Goala in Romania.
578200	583200	But unlike Gunung Padang, they haven't been arranged in patterns and no terraces have
583200	585000	been cut.
585000	591560	There are dozens of megalithic sites in Indonesia, but Gunung Padang is the largest.
591560	596240	After painting a picture of archaeologists as a bunch of nay-saying incompetence, Hancock
596240	602720	interviews a geologist called Danny Natawijaja, who, for the purposes of his programme, represents
602720	604040	the complete opposite.
604040	610680	Dr Danny Hillman Natawijaja studied at Caltech, but now works for Indonesia's geotechnology
610680	612160	research centre.
612160	615800	So a professional, sober, competent geologist.
615800	619880	Absolutely, Danny comes at this as a scientist. His interest is that.
619880	625080	Yeah, good, someone who's completely impartial and only interested in the science, and what
625080	627160	his scientific equipment tells him.
627160	632240	They did ground penetrating radar, seismic tomography, electrical resistivity.
632240	637720	Alright Graham, lots and lots of real and objective science. We get the point.
637720	642920	There had been an archaeological team excavating the site since 2011.
642920	649760	Then in 2013, Natawijaja independently started his own investigation using drills and ground
649760	651880	penetrating radar.
651880	653840	Hancock describes what happened next.
653840	658880	An extraordinary new possibility began to force itself on the researchers.
658880	665280	That they might be confronted by the work of a civilisation lost to history.
665280	670000	But of course, this is a Hancock film, so things are not always as straightforward as
670000	672560	the story we're being told.
672560	679800	Natawijaja is indeed a geologist, a renowned seismologist, very competent in his own field,
679800	682180	and here's one of his books.
682180	688020	But he's also been a long-time proponent of the idea that Indonesia is the site of
688020	689020	Atlantis.
689020	691780	Yes, you heard that right.
691780	696220	He's not only promoted the idea in print, he explained it to Graham Hancock in previous
696220	699940	interviews as far back as 2014.
699940	705660	So the idea of an ancient civilisation was hardly forced on Natawijaja. He'd already
705660	711840	reached that conclusion long before he started his 2013 investigation.
711840	715360	But none of that was mentioned in the Netflix programme.
715360	721120	Natawijaja never published his findings, so all we can go on is a poster he showed at
721120	725960	a meeting of the American Geophysical Union in 2018.
725960	732540	It shows that this supposed pyramid is indeed an extinct volcano, a natural hill with terraces
732540	736880	cut near the top, just as archaeologists had always said.
736880	740840	There's no way for Hancock to get around this embarrassing discovery.
740840	744280	Unless of course he changes the definition of a pyramid.
744280	745280	Which of course he does.
745280	748720	There's a question of definitions here, how do we define a pyramid, but if we define it
748720	753960	as a structure that rises in a series of terraces to a summit, that's what we're looking at.
753960	760560	Well no, I don't define a pyramid as a series of terraces to a summit in a natural hill,
760560	765560	otherwise there are pyramids all over East Asia, and other parts of Indonesia come to
765560	766560	that.
766640	772120	Hancock not only redefines the pyramid, but he also scales back his illustrations.
772120	777680	Just a few years ago, this was what his pyramid supposedly looked like, based on...
777680	780560	Based on the very solid science and archaeological work.
780560	783800	But in the Netflix film, it's been scaled back.
783800	789140	Even with artistic embellishments and a bit of imagination added, it's clearly a natural
789140	792580	hill with a megalithic site on top.
792580	797820	Even the archaeologist Hancock interviews Ali Akbar, who by the way also wants to believe
797820	803420	that Indonesia is an ancient civilisation, confirms that what we see on the hill, all
803420	811340	of this, is a megalithic site about 2,500 years old, and he tells Hancock that.
811340	815820	So now comes the job of making the audience believe there must be something inside the
815820	819660	hill, and watch carefully how he does it.
819660	825180	Next we hear Dr Akbar explain that just below the surface, his team uncovered artefacts
825180	831820	dating back to around 7,200 years ago, suggesting that humans had visited the site that far
831820	833180	back.
833180	836100	And Hancock initially reports this correctly.
836100	841580	They quickly found evidence that humans had been present in what's called a cultural
841580	842580	left.
842580	845900	That's right, evidence that humans had been present.
845900	851260	Hardly surprising in an area where hunter-gatherers would have roamed 7,000 years ago, and no
851260	854740	doubt occasionally camped on top of the hill.
854740	858640	But then Hancock very subtly switches the dates.
858640	864980	He turns the humans, who were here 7,200 years ago, into the builders of a site that he's
864980	875040	just been told is about 2,500 years ago, and the reason no one notices the switch is because
875040	895900	he slips it into a question.
895900	901480	The audience is so busy pondering the question, they don't notice that Hancock has just introduced
901480	905920	not one, but two fallacies into the question.
905920	911160	The first is that all the blocks were brought here, the second is that it was done 7,000
911160	912160	years ago.
912160	917280	I wish I could say that Hancock is a genius at this kind of manipulation, but in fact
917280	919960	it's a very old technique.
919960	924280	Journalists and salesmen use it all the time, so do advertisers.
924280	929760	They don't advertise UK lottery tickets by giving you important and relevant information,
929760	934480	like the fact that only about half the money people spend on lottery tickets actually gets
934480	938960	returned as prizes, or the fact that your chance of winning the jackpot is around one
938960	941000	in 45 million.
941000	946560	They have to ignore inconvenient facts and instead feed your imagination.
946560	952160	And the best way to do that is to ask, what would you do if you won?
952160	957480	And even the implicit if you won is either subdued or completely omitted, because we
957480	962160	have to turn this improbability into something people believe could be real.
962160	964160	What would I do if I won Lotto?
964160	966160	I'd play 18 holes at Glen Eagles.
966160	968160	I'd really love to see the Northern Lights.
968160	972160	If I won Lotto, I'd get myself a house with my own pool.
972160	974300	Lotto, what would you do?
974300	978720	Having given this impression that all these stones were physically carried to the site,
978720	980680	Hancock then reinforces it.
980680	986760	Only one of these blocks, up to 50,000 of them, and each weighing up to a third of a
986760	989560	tonne, were carried up this hill.
989560	992840	Even the experts Hancock spoke to don't make that claim.
992840	997760	Again, the columns are perfectly natural and they're found scattered naturally at Gunung
997760	1001880	Padang, just as they are at Detonata Goalla.
1001880	1004760	And also here at the Devil's Post pile in California.
1004760	1009720	They're the result of cooling joints, weathering and collapsing.
1009960	1014960	According to a paper published by the University of Geneva, some of the stones had been transported
1014960	1017700	and they were used for the stairway.
1017700	1022880	They were brought from 300 metres away from the Sakuta River and others a little further
1022880	1024800	down the valley.
1024800	1031680	Not an impossible feat even for hunter-gatherers, let alone Iron Age people from 500BC.
1031680	1037080	There are dozens of examples of monuments being built around that time and even older,
1037080	1041480	not just in Indonesia but all over South East Asia.
1041480	1047440	Sometimes we know exactly how they were moved because the practice continued until recently.
1047440	1049840	Sometimes we know how they could have been moved.
1049840	1056680	All it takes is organisation, manpower, a few simple tools and lots of rope.
1056680	1062300	So there's really no mystery in how people from 2500 years ago could have rearranged
1062300	1067620	columnar joints they found naturally scattered on top of Gunung Padang.
1067620	1070160	And that's the problem for Hancock.
1070160	1076380	Because his books and his films depend on a mystery that he steps in to solve.
1076380	1079500	So he has to manufacture one.
1079500	1084500	Now all we need is another manufactured mystery to push the date back even further.
1084500	1085620	And here it is.
1085620	1088740	Natui Jaja has found something inside the hill.
1088740	1089740	There's a void.
1089740	1091380	Yes, there's a void.
1091380	1094220	Wouldn't that be accompanied by a dramatic heartbeat?
1094220	1096020	There's a void.
1096020	1097020	That's better.
1097020	1104360	What Dr. Hillman and his team have discovered are at least three large rectangular chambers.
1104360	1109420	One around 10 metres down, perhaps an entrance hall of some kind.
1109420	1115660	It seems to have an access tunnel leading to a larger main chamber and another passage
1115660	1117180	connecting to a third chamber.
1117180	1121740	OK, hold the image you've just made in your head, visualising the inside of these
1121740	1124020	large rectangular chambers.
1124020	1127900	I'm guessing it's something like this, right?
1127900	1132180	But look how quickly the programme has taken us on a journey of the mind just by slipping
1132180	1134280	in a few trigger words.
1134280	1141360	From low velocity zone, to void, to chamber, to a large rectangular chamber, to an entrance
1141360	1144420	hall reinforced by an artist's imagination.
1144420	1148820	Boy, you're going to be so disappointed when you see what these chambers actually
1148820	1150700	look like.
1150700	1151700	Here they are.
1151700	1157720	They're just amorphous, low density anomalies on the tomographic readouts.
1157720	1162540	The reason they show up as different colours is because of the different methods of tomography
1162540	1163860	used.
1163860	1169280	Only one looks vaguely rectangular in two dimensions at an angle not very conducive
1169280	1171140	to standing upright.
1171140	1174900	The rest are all different shapes and orientations.
1174900	1180020	You can see that better if I outline the areas Natui Jaja has identified.
1180020	1185140	These are all the shapes of the voids, though not on the same scale.
1185140	1190220	Now as a geologist, when I hear about voids like this inside a volcano, my first thought
1190220	1194820	is a very common geological feature called a lava tube.
1194820	1198920	The surface cools quicker and forms a solid crust.
1198920	1204920	The river of molten lava underneath pushes its way through, expanding the crust.
1204920	1210040	When the lava has run out, you're left with hollow tubes like this.
1210040	1215520	But Hancock never mentions lava tubes, because again that doesn't fit the image he's trying
1215520	1222040	to feed you, and any doubts or ambiguities are disguised, like this question mark against
1222040	1228360	the word chamber, which was in Natui Jaja's original poster but got airbrushed out for
1228360	1237760	the Netflix film.
1237760	1240880	On the contrary, it makes perfect sense.
1240880	1245880	Volcanoes are exactly where you'd expect to find natural cavities.
1245880	1250680	Once again, this is an example of Hancock manufacturing a mystery, proclaiming that
1250680	1255600	archaeologists have no explanation for the mystery he's made up, and then proceeding
1255600	1259620	to try to solve the made-up mystery himself.
1259620	1265960	So is there anything in this volcano that does point to an ancient civilisation?
1265960	1268480	Hancock has only one thing left to try.
1268480	1271520	To put a date on this hill that's not a hill.
1271520	1273680	Hold on, it is a hill, Graham.
1273680	1275360	We've been through this already.
1275360	1280760	You're not going to pretend it isn't a hill, either by redefining the word pyramid or putting
1280760	1283200	the word not into the script.
1283200	1286360	OK, let's continue putting a date on this hill.
1286360	1291520	Oh, and see if you can spot the four trigger words that Hancock slips in here, to turn
1291520	1295760	a rather ordinary dating result into yet another mystery.
1295760	1301760	Dr Hillman and his team turned to another geological tool.
1301760	1302760	Core drilling.
1302760	1308800	Going further down, around 100 feet or so, he hit the earliest layer of construction.
1308800	1311480	Let's try and put dates on when this was shaped.
1311480	1312840	Did you spot them?
1312840	1314480	Here they are in caps.
1314480	1320880	Hancock is feeding us cues to imagine columns that have been laid out, and constructed,
1320880	1322460	and shaped.
1322460	1325600	But where is the evidence for that?
1325600	1329500	All the drill brought up were lumps of soil and pieces of rock.
1329500	1335520	There are no artefacts, no inscriptions, no carvings, no evidence of construction or shaping
1335520	1338120	or anything being laid out.
1338120	1342440	Unless there was, you can bet Hancock would be proudly showing it off.
1342440	1346440	Denny's findings are utterly extraordinary and bewildering.
1346440	1348200	Well, not really.
1348200	1353240	Nutterwey Judger drilled down into a volcanic hill and came up with samples of volcanic
1353240	1354360	rock.
1354360	1356960	It says so in his Core Log.
1356960	1358120	Read it.
1358120	1364920	Fragments of columnar joints, basaltic andesite rock, and fresh, massive, fractured basaltic
1364920	1370640	andesite rocks, which is as unremarkable as putting a spoon into a trifle and coming
1370640	1372240	up with jello.
1372240	1375600	Not one piece of evidence of human manipulation.
1375600	1381240	Those drill cores were pulling out dateable materials that dated way back as far as 24,000
1381240	1382320	years ago.
1382320	1385360	But what is that dateable material?
1385360	1390420	According to Nutterwey Judger, who documents the dating results in his poster, it's just
1390420	1394200	natural soil from 10 metres down.
1394200	1399240	But that's hardly a surprise because the further you go down into any soil, the older
1399240	1400920	it is.
1400920	1405520	Notwithstanding leaching and other problems associated with dating soils, if you drill
1405520	1411520	down to a layer of soil that's 24,000 years old anywhere in the world, you'll get organic
1411520	1415520	material that dates to 24,000 years ago.
1415520	1419940	It doesn't mean there's a lost civilisation down there.
1419940	1424500	But at least we now know how Hancock came up with the claim, shown at the beginning
1424500	1430560	of his video, that this extinct volcano is a 20,000 year old pyramid.
1430560	1434860	And it can be done with any megalithic site with terraces.
1434860	1439140	First define a pyramid as any hill with terraces at the top.
1439140	1443540	Then drill down until you get to soil that's 20,000 years old.
1443540	1447060	And voila, you've manufactured a mystery.
1447060	1451340	Slip it into a question to divert audience attention.
1451340	1455300	Why is there a 20,000 year old pyramid in Indonesia?
1455300	1460060	Towards the end of that first episode, Hancock moves to another place where volcanic columns
1460060	1464500	were used in construction at Nan Madol in Micronesia.
1464500	1470060	Archaeologists believe most of the construction visible at Nan Madol today dates to around
1470060	1476260	900 years ago when the blocks were quarried at a neighbouring island.
1476260	1482020	But during my explorations on previous visits, I found several of its megalithic pillars
1482020	1488960	extending out below the waterline, suggesting that earlier versions may have been constructed
1488960	1492820	when sea levels were lower during the last ice age.
1492820	1497940	Or it suggests that Hancock has rushed to judgement in claiming these are megalithic
1497940	1503260	pillars, without bothering to check whether they actually are.
1503260	1508220	But anyway, first, what image do you have in your head, what impression of events, based
1508220	1510340	on Hancock's story?
1510340	1515420	Narrow minded archaeologists developed a fixed idea about the construction based on what
1515420	1517240	they see on land.
1517240	1522860	But then Hancock went underwater and discovered pillars that could be much, much older, thus
1522860	1526500	challenging their dogmatic conclusion.
1526500	1530020	Archaeologist nil, Hancock won, right?
1530020	1534380	OK, perhaps you're having second thoughts about forming that impression, because you
1534380	1539540	know that of course I'm now going to blow this bullshit apart.
1539540	1543540	First Hancock implies that he found the underwater pillars.
1543540	1549500	But in fact they'd been found about 20 years earlier by an archaeologist called Arthur
1549500	1552860	Sacks from Ohio State University.
1552860	1559320	And another archaeological team in 1988 and 1989 had investigated them further.
1559320	1563320	But neither gets a mention in the Netflix programme, because that doesn't fit the
1563320	1569160	image of archaeologists as narrow minded buffoons who never look outside the obvious.
1569160	1574220	It has to be Hancock, the visionary free thinker, who takes the initiative to dive into the
1574220	1578000	water and find these pillars himself.
1578000	1583480	But when he supposedly found these man made pillars in 1998, Hancock must have already
1583480	1587160	known that they were almost certainly not man made.
1587160	1590680	They're made of natural coral.
1590680	1595400	Years earlier a team from the University of Oregon had drilled 20 centimetres into several
1595400	1598920	of the pillars and only found coral.
1598920	1603880	Then they raised one of the pillars to the surface, cut it open and confirmed it was
1603880	1609200	entirely made of coral and therefore entirely natural.
1609200	1614120	But the entire story we're about to hear is dependent on these underwater columns being
1614120	1624480	man made stone pillars, so Hancock completely ignores the archaeologists' findings.
1624480	1629920	Well those architects lived about 2500 years ago, so who knows.
1629920	1635840	Of course Hancock's referring to his imaginary ice age civilisation that he believes built
1635840	1640920	an imaginary structure inside the volcano 20,000 years ago.
1640920	1646080	Despite having no evidence for their existence, he now has them getting into boats and sailing
1646080	1652540	thousands of miles across the open ocean to raise stones on a remote Pacific island.
1652540	1657360	But if these pillars under the water at Nan Madol are just coral, then there's no man
1657360	1662760	made construction under the water, and with no man made construction under the water,
1662760	1665960	then there's no ice age civilisation there.
1666000	1671640	And with no ice age civilisation at Nan Madol, then there was no voyage across the Pacific,
1671640	1678320	which means this whole elaborate train of speculation comes crashing down.
1678320	1682640	But anyway the audience doesn't know any of this and there's no time to think, they're
1682640	1687680	already focused on the mystery of what happened to this ice age civilisation.
1687680	1690660	And if so, what happened to them?
1690660	1696240	Having manufactured this phony mystery, Hancock steps in as the only person who can provide
1696240	1697240	an answer.
1697240	1703400	Well I believe it has something to do with what happened around 12,800 years ago.
1703400	1710020	What happened 12,800 years ago was an event called the Younger Dryas, a period when deglaciation
1710020	1715260	suddenly went into reverse and the Earth rapidly cooled down again.
1715260	1718940	Hancock calls the Younger Dryas a major cataclysm.
1718940	1725020	As the ice sheets advanced, ecosystems changed and some large animals became extinct.
1725020	1729420	And apparently Hancock had predicted all that back in 1995.
1729420	1734140	To me in 1995 when I wrote Fingerprints of the Gods, but there was no compelling evidence
1734140	1735420	for a global cataclysm then.
1735420	1738560	But of course there was compelling evidence back then.
1738560	1742420	The Younger Dryas has been known about for 120 years.
1743180	1747740	Hypotheses for what caused it have varied from the breach of an ice dam, sending trillions
1747740	1753000	of tonnes of cold water into the Atlantic thermohaline circulation, to the hypothesis
1753000	1758780	of a comet impact, a major volcanic eruption or a shift in the jet stream.
1758780	1764480	Hancock isn't a visionary who predicted this major cataclysm back in 1995.
1764480	1768820	He knew about it because it was in every geology textbook.
1768820	1774100	Well even I studied the Younger Dryas as far back as 1975.
1774100	1779260	So let's see what sort of cataclysm Hancock thinks the Younger Dryas produced.
1779260	1783900	First global temperatures plunge to the level that they were at the peak of the ice age
1783900	1787140	and they do so almost literally overnight.
1787140	1788640	No they didn't.
1788640	1794840	The Younger Dryas began around 12,850 years ago and average global temperature fell to
1794880	1799360	its lowest level around 12,700 years ago.
1799360	1802820	That's a period of 150 years.
1802820	1808080	Now you may say, but Hancock doesn't mean literally almost overnight.
1808080	1810080	But yes, he does.
1810080	1815340	Hancock specifically says almost literally overnight, because you need that image of
1815340	1820320	a sudden plunge in temperature in order to build on what comes next.
1820320	1825260	And secondly, there's a sudden and inexplicable rise in sea level.
1825260	1826620	No there wasn't.
1826620	1831640	Sea levels have been rising since the end of the glaciation as oceans warmed and ice
1831640	1832640	melted.
1832640	1837680	It had been going on for 7,000 years before the Younger Dryas and it continued during
1837680	1843360	the Younger Dryas and it carried on for 5,000 years after the Younger Dryas.
1843360	1851020	During 12,800 and 11,600 years ago, the oceans of the world rose dramatically in a series
1851020	1854600	of immense deluges.
1854600	1855880	No they didn't.
1855880	1860960	But first, what do you imagine now that you've been fed trigger words like dramatically,
1860960	1863080	immense and deluge?
1863080	1864920	Something like this?
1864920	1870740	This is the video Hancock actually shows in the programme to back up the words.
1870740	1874540	But forget the images, let's concentrate on the figures.
1874540	1875960	What period of time was that again?
1875960	1880060	Between 12,800 and 11,600 years ago.
1880060	1882780	But that's 1,200 years.
1882780	1885460	And how much did sea level rise during that time?
1885460	1888180	The oceans of the world rose dramatically.
1888180	1892460	No dramatically isn't a number, it's just an image.
1892460	1895780	Hancock doesn't give us a figure for good reason.
1895780	1902060	During the timeline he cites, sea level rose around 17 metres, which is very dramatic,
1902060	1909420	but over a 1,200 year time period that's about 14mm a year, just over half an inch.
1909420	1914420	This epoch of immense floods would have traumatised all of humanity.
1914420	1917080	No it wouldn't.
1917080	1924220	The so-called great dramatically immense traumatising deluge didn't look so much like this, as
1924220	1925220	this.
1925660	1930020	If you stood on the beach at high tide during the Younger Dryas, then the immense deluge
1930020	1935480	would probably have reached your ankles after about 6 years.
1935480	1940260	Even if you doubled the rate of rise, it would still take 3 years for the water to reach
1940260	1941260	your ankles.
1941260	1947200	We've had an average global rise in sea level of around 60mm in the last 20 years,
1947200	1952100	so hard to detect without instruments that a lot of people write into the channel saying
1952100	1954660	they don't even believe it's happening.
1954660	1959860	Why would a rise of half an inch a year during the Younger Dryas have been any more traumatising
1959860	1964960	or noticeable than the same rise that had been going on for thousands of years before
1964960	1968820	it and would continue for thousands of years afterwards?
1968820	1972460	Hancock doesn't explain because he doesn't have to.
1972460	1977420	His audience, the kind of people who buy his books, is completely unaware of the rate of
1977420	1980660	sea level rise and he never tells them.
1980660	1986220	He leaves it to trigger words and images to give an impression instead of explaining the
1986220	1987980	facts.
1987980	1992220	To be fair to Hancock, he makes no claim to be looking at the subject impartially.
1992220	1998980	It's not my job to be balanced or objective, he writes, he's just providing a persuasive
1998980	2004720	single-minded case for the existence of a lost civilisation to balance the history books
2004720	2009860	and academics who do nothing but refine existing orthodoxy.
2009860	2015480	But trying to be persuasive doesn't give Hancock the right to fabricate evidence, misrepresent
2015480	2019880	findings and hide facts that contradict his beliefs.
2019880	2024360	And how is it balancing the history books when most people have never read a history
2024360	2027940	book on Gunung Padang or Nan Madol?
2027940	2031740	All they know about these places is what Hancock tells them.
2031740	2036200	And all they know about the conclusions of archaeologists about these places is what
2036200	2037860	Hancock makes up.
2037860	2042740	Neither two archaeologists had regarded it as a long-established fact that no large-scale
2042740	2047100	structures were built anywhere in Southeast Asia until around 4000 years ago.
2047100	2052820	I was curious as to why so many people swallow whatever Hancock tells them without question.
2052820	2056940	Looking at the comments on the video of his Joe Rogan interview, some of his fans are
2056940	2062100	impressed with his eloquent speaking voice, his recall of information.
2062100	2067060	Whether the information is real or made up doesn't seem to occur to them.
2067060	2071340	The praises heaped on interviewers like Joe Rogan for sitting there and letting Hancock
2071340	2078020	unleash all these claims without once critically questioning a single thing he says.
2078020	2082960	It seems like heresy to question it because Hancock's giving his audience what they crave
2082960	2094460	– lots and lots of supposed mysteries.
2094460	2097860	To all the Hancock fans out there, I do get the appeal.
2097860	2104040	And of course I would love these mysteries to be real and a lost civilisation discovered.
2104040	2109460	It would be much more exciting if a cavity in a volcano was an ancient entrance hall
2109460	2112780	rather than just a plain old lava tube.
2112780	2119280	Or if this was part of a man-made construction rather than just a boring old pillar coral.
2119280	2120620	No one's against that.
2120620	2123740	Who doesn't want to find a lost civilisation?
2123740	2126260	For that you need evidence.
2126260	2131340	As Mick Astin said, at the end of the day what professionals want to find is what's
2131340	2133260	actually there.
2133260	2138200	If the only way to support this dream of what amateurs want to find is to fabricate imaginary
2138200	2144140	evidence and ignore real evidence, then sorry of course no one in the archaeological community
2144140	2146920	is going to take it seriously.
2146920	2151420	So I would love to hear from Hancock fans to see what you think.
2151420	2155840	Please don't just write comments saying my video is bullshit, or it's an ad hominem
2155840	2157300	attack against Hancock.
2157300	2162540	I'm not judging his eloquent speaking voice, his intelligence or his personality.
2162540	2167920	I'm happy to agree with all the gushing praise of his personal qualities.
2167920	2174220	What I'm concerned with are the fabrications and the omissions, so please address that.
2174220	2178900	And if you think there really is evidence that Gunung Padang is a 20,000 year old pyramid,
2178900	2183740	or that these pillars at Nan Madol are man-made, please post it.
2183740	2189640	If you can't do that, and prefer to launch a tirade against my voice or my personality,
2189640	2190640	please do so.
2190640	2194480	I'll take that as an admission that you can't find fault with my critique.
2194480	2197780	So having a go at me is the best you can do.
2197780	2203280	It's ironic that Hancock accuses archaeologists of sticking rigidly to orthodox theory when
2203280	2208260	in fact there have been huge changes in their understanding of our Paleolithic and Neolithic
2208260	2209860	ancestors.
2209860	2215500	New evidence and new discoveries is the way all sciences progress, not through beliefs
2215500	2218960	and wishes, but through hard physical evidence.
2218960	2224220	The image Hancock gives of orthodox archaeological theory, that hunter-gatherers suddenly settled
2224220	2230000	down and became farmers and then built cities, has long been overturned.
2230000	2235140	Archaeologists discovered decades ago that hunter-gatherer societies were far from simple,
2235140	2239840	and the line between hunter-gatherers and settled farmers is blurred.
2239840	2244940	They were often both, and changed from one to the other as circumstances allowed over
2244940	2246820	thousands of years.
2246820	2251900	And far from being simple, they established trading routes, made art, and constructed
2251900	2255220	gathering places and sacred sites.
2255220	2259720	And archaeologists may have discovered the reason for the site at Gunung Padang.
2259720	2266020	A 2008, un-peer-reviewed study by Darlan and Sittungkir found that when you strike
2266020	2271220	some of these stones, the ones that are grouped together, they produce notes in harmony with
2271220	2278300	F, G, D and A. That might have given the site spiritual significance.
2278300	2283560	The authors hypothesise that over many years, people arranged the musical stones to be used
2283560	2288860	as instruments, perhaps for spiritual or ceremonial purposes.
2288860	2293960	It's only a hypothesis, but importantly, it's backed by actual evidence.
2293960	2300080	And to me, reality based on evidence is always far more interesting than a belief based on
2300080	2302420	fabrications.
2302420	2307280	These new discoveries in archaeology weren't dreamed up by flying to famous landmarks around
2307280	2309840	the world and making up stories.
2309840	2316080	They have been made by archaeologists spending years, or even decades, in hot and dusty places
2316080	2319280	digging up hard evidence out of the ground.
2319280	2327460	By analysing seeds, by tracing DNA, by matching pottery and finding real, not imaginary, evidence
2327460	2329580	of construction.
2329580	2335540	And every day as a result of their efforts, we're learning something new about our past.
2335540	2344200	And not one shred of evidence so far points to even a trace of an ice age civilisation.
2344200	2348180	So it's not archaeologists who are sticking rigidly to fixed ideas.
2348180	2354460	Ironically, it's Hancock who for 30 years has stuck to his unwavering belief in this
2354460	2357720	imaginary ice age civilisation.
2357720	2362740	Now I don't doubt his sincerity he really does believe it.
2362740	2368640	So much so, that he's prepared to make up a host of fabrications to support it and airbrush
2368640	2370840	out anything that contradicts it.
2374420	2378820	My channel doesn't ask for money, and unlike most YouTubers, I don't make these videos
2378820	2380900	for financial gain.
2380900	2385140	But since people have frequently asked if they can contribute something, I've suggested
2385140	2389100	they send money to an innovative charity called Health in Harmony.
2389100	2395780	The model has resulted in 70% less deforestation in an important national park, saving over
2395780	2399560	27 square kilometres of rainforest.
2399580	2405500	The study also found that it's provided cheap medical services for over 28,000 people who
2405500	2410180	would otherwise have been cutting down trees to pay for healthcare.
2410180	2415620	The model is now being extended from the forests of Borneo to Madagascar and Amazonia, funded
2415620	2419900	in large part by contributions from my subscribers.
2419900	2424340	Details are in the video description, and my thanks to all those who've contributed.
