00:00.000 --> 00:04.000
Climate change is a natural phenomenon that has always been, but always will be.

00:04.000 --> 00:08.000
Climate does change. It always has, and it always will.

00:08.000 --> 00:13.000
Yes, OK, the climate changes. In science that's what's called an observation,

00:13.000 --> 00:17.000
just as we can observe lightning, shooting stars and earthquakes.

00:17.000 --> 00:22.000
They're all natural. But the role of scientists isn't to sit back and marvel at all these natural mysteries.

00:22.000 --> 00:25.000
It's to find out why they happen.

00:25.000 --> 00:29.000
So what climatologists want to know is what causes the climate to change.

00:29.000 --> 00:33.000
And after two centuries of research, they now have a pretty good idea.

00:33.000 --> 00:35.000
Let's just recap.

00:35.000 --> 00:38.000
Insulation is the amount of energy we get from the Sun.

00:38.000 --> 00:41.000
It depends not only on the energy output of the Sun,

00:41.000 --> 00:46.000
but on how the Earth is positioned to receive it, its tilt and orbit.

00:46.000 --> 00:50.000
Greenhouse gases, things like water vapour, carbon dioxide and methane.

00:50.000 --> 00:55.000
And thirdly, particulates and aerosols. They come from volcanoes and meteorite impacts.

00:55.000 --> 00:57.000
They block sunlight and cool the Earth down,

00:57.000 --> 01:01.000
and aerosols caused by industrial pollution do the same thing.

01:01.000 --> 01:05.000
Finally, the Earth itself can amplify these changes through positive feedback,

01:05.000 --> 01:08.000
and even the configuration of the continents.

01:08.000 --> 01:10.000
And so we come to our first urban myth,

01:10.000 --> 01:14.000
which happened to pop up in the comments forum of one of my climate videos.

01:14.000 --> 01:19.000
The myth is that since temperatures were higher in the past with lower CO2,

01:19.000 --> 01:21.000
and sometimes lower with higher CO2,

01:21.000 --> 01:24.000
carbon dioxide can't be a factor in climate change.

01:24.000 --> 01:27.000
Even Bob Carter has fallen for this one.

01:27.000 --> 01:30.000
Here's a graph he produced, apparently showing no correlation

01:30.000 --> 01:33.000
between carbon dioxide and global temperatures

01:33.000 --> 01:37.000
over the Phanerozoic, the last 500 million years of the Earth's history.

01:37.000 --> 01:39.000
But I'm pretty sure on this one, Bob,

01:39.000 --> 01:41.000
because it's in all the scientific literature.

01:41.000 --> 01:43.000
You wouldn't expect to get a match-up

01:43.000 --> 01:47.000
because carbon dioxide isn't the only factor that affects global temperatures.

01:47.000 --> 01:51.000
No climatologist ever said it was. Just read the journals.

01:52.000 --> 01:56.000
On a geological time scale, the Sun is the other main driver of climate.

01:56.000 --> 01:58.000
And as every geologist should know,

01:58.000 --> 02:01.000
solar output was much weaker in the deep past.

02:01.000 --> 02:05.000
The red line here shows solar output throughout the Earth's history.

02:05.000 --> 02:09.000
What we're interested in is the last 500 million years.

02:09.000 --> 02:13.000
Like most stars, the Sun has been growing increasingly brighter with time.

02:13.000 --> 02:16.000
If I compared solar irradiance with global temperatures

02:16.000 --> 02:18.000
over the last half billion years,

02:18.000 --> 02:22.000
I'd get no better a correlation than Carter did with carbon dioxide.

02:22.000 --> 02:26.000
But if we combine the two, solar irradiation and carbon dioxide,

02:26.000 --> 02:29.000
then there's a very good correlation.

02:29.000 --> 02:31.000
I'll come back to this later,

02:31.000 --> 02:35.000
but why is the correlation so good if there are all these other factors?

02:35.000 --> 02:39.000
Well, the Earth's tilt and orbit are predictable and run in cycles.

02:39.000 --> 02:42.000
The effect of particulates is usually short-lived.

02:42.000 --> 02:45.000
And the concentration of water vapour is controlled by temperature,

02:45.000 --> 02:49.000
so it acts as an amplifier rather than a prime driver of climate.

02:49.000 --> 02:53.000
Over the long term, carbon dioxide and solar output, or irradiance,

02:53.000 --> 02:55.000
are the biggest variables.

02:55.000 --> 02:58.000
Let me put this very simply with an analogy.

02:58.000 --> 03:00.000
Let's say you're staying in a house in mid-winter

03:00.000 --> 03:04.000
and all you have to heat it with is a fireplace and an electric heater.

03:04.000 --> 03:06.000
If they're both full-on, you'll bake,

03:06.000 --> 03:09.000
and if they're both turned down very low, you'll freeze.

03:09.000 --> 03:12.000
The house could even get cold if the fire's going nicely,

03:12.000 --> 03:14.000
but the heater's turned down very low.

03:14.000 --> 03:17.000
So the Earth's climate depends on a combination of factors,

03:17.000 --> 03:19.000
and it's actually quite lucky for us

03:19.000 --> 03:23.000
that carbon dioxide levels have generally fallen over geological time

03:23.000 --> 03:26.000
to balance the growing irradiance of the Sun.

03:26.000 --> 03:29.000
Two researchers who are sceptical of the influence of CO2

03:29.000 --> 03:31.000
have put forward an alternative idea

03:31.000 --> 03:35.000
that the Earth cools as it passes through the spiral arms of our galaxy.

03:35.000 --> 03:40.000
The idea is that cosmic rays ionise the air and that seeds clouds,

03:40.000 --> 03:44.000
and clouds reflect sunlight, and that cools the Earth down.

03:44.000 --> 03:47.000
Shivivam Veda's paper has been widely circulated

03:47.000 --> 03:51.000
but not widely accepted within the scientific community.

03:51.000 --> 03:54.000
No, not because of some conspiracy of evil scientists,

03:54.000 --> 03:57.000
but because the idea that cosmic rays seed clouds

03:57.000 --> 04:00.000
and that clouds cool the climate hasn't been shown.

04:00.000 --> 04:02.000
I explained the background to this in my video

04:02.000 --> 04:04.000
Climate Change the Objections.

04:04.000 --> 04:08.000
Also, geologists say there are problems with the dating method used

04:08.000 --> 04:10.000
and with the correlation itself.

04:10.000 --> 04:13.000
And as the authors themselves admit,

04:13.000 --> 04:16.000
the hypothesis can't explain current climate change

04:16.000 --> 04:18.000
because it takes millions of years for the Solar System

04:18.000 --> 04:20.000
to pass through a spiral arm.

04:20.000 --> 04:24.000
I'm very glad a couple of qualified sceptics who know their subject

04:24.000 --> 04:27.000
chose to publish their research in a respected peer-reviewed journal.

04:27.000 --> 04:30.000
That's how scientific procedure is supposed to work.

04:30.000 --> 04:34.000
Unfortunately, Shiviv's university issued a press release at the same time

04:34.000 --> 04:38.000
the paper was published, making claims that weren't in there.

04:38.000 --> 04:40.000
Most journalists read the press release

04:40.000 --> 04:42.000
and didn't bother to read the paper.

04:42.000 --> 04:45.000
So the headline that went around the world was this one,

04:45.000 --> 04:48.000
even though the paper says nothing of the sort.

04:48.000 --> 04:52.000
In fact, it specifically argues against drawing inferences

04:52.000 --> 04:54.000
about current climate change.

04:54.000 --> 04:57.000
Shivivam Veda go on to say that other research suggests

04:57.000 --> 05:00.000
cosmic rays may also work on a smaller time scale,

05:00.000 --> 05:03.000
but that hypothesis has since collapsed

05:03.000 --> 05:05.000
because of a mathematical error,

05:05.000 --> 05:09.000
which I explained in my video, Climate Change, the Objections.

05:09.000 --> 05:12.000
So what we're left with are two very clear drivers of climate

05:12.000 --> 05:16.000
that fit very well with the reconstruction of the Earth's climatic history.

05:16.000 --> 05:20.000
From 2004 to 2006, researchers reviewed the scientific literature

05:20.000 --> 05:24.000
and examined solar output, carbon dioxide levels and temperature data

05:24.000 --> 05:27.000
from every period of the Phanerozoic,

05:27.000 --> 05:29.000
from the Tertiary to the lower Ordovician.

05:29.000 --> 05:32.000
And they found a very good correlation.

05:32.000 --> 05:35.000
Critics say the correlation breaks down in two places,

05:35.000 --> 05:37.000
the Ordovician and the Cretaceous periods,

05:37.000 --> 05:42.000
when there were very high CO2 levels coinciding with extensive ice cover.

05:42.000 --> 05:47.000
But of course we have to remember the climate isn't driven by carbon dioxide alone,

05:47.000 --> 05:51.000
and at times even the combined influence of solar output and CO2 levels

05:51.000 --> 05:54.000
can be upset by the other factors that affect climate.

05:54.000 --> 05:58.000
The Ordovician seems to be a particular favourite with amateur sceptics

05:58.000 --> 06:01.000
because it experienced a full-blown ice age.

06:01.000 --> 06:06.000
I'm often referred to this website, run not by a climatologist, no surprise,

06:06.000 --> 06:09.000
but by a mining engineer called Monty Hebe.

06:09.000 --> 06:11.000
To the consternation of global warming proponents,

06:11.000 --> 06:14.000
the late Ordovician period was also an ice age,

06:14.000 --> 06:20.000
while at the same time CO2 concentrations then were nearly 12 times higher than today.

06:20.000 --> 06:24.000
According to greenhouse theory, Earth should have been exceedingly hot, blah blah blah.

06:24.000 --> 06:28.000
No, according to greenhouse theory, if you want to call it that,

06:28.000 --> 06:33.000
global temperatures vary depending on several factors, not just carbon dioxide.

06:33.000 --> 06:37.000
So let's go back over 20 years of research into the Ordovician climate

06:37.000 --> 06:41.000
and see what real climate scientists have discovered.

06:41.000 --> 06:44.000
First of all, solar output during the Ordovician was, of course,

06:44.000 --> 06:48.000
much weaker than today, about 4.5% weaker.

06:48.000 --> 06:51.000
That should have been enough to plunge the Earth into an ice age.

06:51.000 --> 06:53.000
It certainly would today.

06:53.000 --> 06:55.000
But in fact the climate was much hotter,

06:55.000 --> 06:59.000
way beyond any forecast of what we're expecting in the next 100 years.

06:59.000 --> 07:01.000
How can that be?

07:01.000 --> 07:05.000
Well, paleoclimatologists have concluded it's because carbon dioxide levels

07:05.000 --> 07:08.000
were around 18 times higher than today.

07:08.000 --> 07:11.000
So if all that carbon dioxide was keeping the Earth hot,

07:11.000 --> 07:14.000
why did it suddenly descend into an ice age?

07:14.000 --> 07:18.000
This was a problem facing geologists over a decade ago.

07:18.000 --> 07:21.000
The only way to cool the Earth down would have been to remove

07:21.000 --> 07:24.000
billions of tonnes of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere.

07:24.000 --> 07:26.000
But there was no known mechanism for that happening

07:26.000 --> 07:29.000
over such a short period of time.

07:29.000 --> 07:32.000
In 1994 geologists discovered that carbon dioxide levels

07:32.000 --> 07:36.000
did indeed drop dramatically towards the end of the Ordovician.

07:36.000 --> 07:38.000
The reason still wasn't clear.

07:38.000 --> 07:40.000
Climatologists calculated that such a drop

07:40.000 --> 07:42.000
would have caused global temperatures to fall,

07:42.000 --> 07:45.000
but there was still more than enough CO2 in the atmosphere

07:45.000 --> 07:47.000
to prevent an ice age.

07:47.000 --> 07:51.000
Then in 1995 researchers from Texas A&M showed that

07:51.000 --> 07:53.000
one other factor had come into play,

07:53.000 --> 07:55.000
the position of the continents,

07:55.000 --> 07:58.000
which had joined into a supercontinent near the South Pole.

07:58.000 --> 08:01.000
They also concluded that the Earth's orbit might have played a role

08:01.000 --> 08:04.000
in reducing solar irradiance even further.

08:04.000 --> 08:07.000
Two years later researchers from Pennsylvania State University

08:07.000 --> 08:10.000
calculated that all these factors put together,

08:10.000 --> 08:13.000
including the drop in carbon dioxide levels,

08:13.000 --> 08:16.000
would have been enough to precipitate an ice age.

08:16.000 --> 08:19.000
Then in 1999 and 2005,

08:19.000 --> 08:23.000
newspapers began to shed light on the reason carbon dioxide levels fell.

08:23.000 --> 08:26.000
During the Ordovician, the Atlantic Oceanic crust

08:26.000 --> 08:29.000
was subducting under the North American continent.

08:29.000 --> 08:31.000
This thrust up the Appalachian Mountains.

08:31.000 --> 08:36.000
As they rose, the silicate rocks in these newly formed mountains rapidly weathered.

08:36.000 --> 08:39.000
This happens through a simple chemical process.

08:39.000 --> 08:41.000
Carbon dioxide reacts with silicate rock,

08:41.000 --> 08:44.000
forming calcium or magnesium carbonate.

08:44.000 --> 08:46.000
This is washed away into the sea,

08:46.000 --> 08:48.000
gets taken up by organisms in their shells,

08:48.000 --> 08:52.000
and then gets buried as sediment that turns into limestone or chalk.

08:52.000 --> 08:56.000
So the carbon that was once in the atmosphere got buried at sea,

08:56.000 --> 09:01.000
and over millions of years, trillions of tons of carbon were removed from the air.

09:01.000 --> 09:04.000
So scientists are more than happy to talk about this U-boat 21.

09:04.000 --> 09:08.000
In fact, they've been yakking about it for well over two decades.

09:08.000 --> 09:10.000
It's just that you haven't noticed

09:10.000 --> 09:13.000
because it's all been published in scientific journals.

09:13.000 --> 09:17.000
These aren't inaccessible. You can find them quite easily online.

09:17.000 --> 09:20.000
But they don't get passed around and re-pasted on internet blogs.

09:20.000 --> 09:22.000
They require a bit of effort.

09:22.000 --> 09:25.000
I suppose it's quicker and easier to read a blog by a mining engineer

09:25.000 --> 09:28.000
and come away thinking you're an instant expert.

09:28.000 --> 09:31.000
It's kind of the fast-food approach to science.

09:31.000 --> 09:34.000
So all the Mc-experts who argue that the Earth was cold

09:34.000 --> 09:37.000
when carbon dioxide levels were high

09:37.000 --> 09:40.000
miss the equally irrelevant point that the Earth was much hotter than today

09:40.000 --> 09:43.000
when solar output was much lower than today.

09:43.000 --> 09:46.000
It's a combination of factors that drives our climate.

09:46.000 --> 09:50.000
But a lot of people continue to think that the sun is acting alone.

09:50.000 --> 09:54.000
None of the major climate changes in the last thousand years

09:54.000 --> 09:57.000
can be explained by CO2.

09:57.000 --> 09:59.000
Well, I can beat that.

09:59.000 --> 10:03.000
None of the major climate changes in the last 1,150 years

10:03.000 --> 10:05.000
can be explained by CO2.

10:05.000 --> 10:07.000
And there's a very good reason for that.

10:07.000 --> 10:11.000
CO2 levels have been more or less constant during that time.

10:11.000 --> 10:14.000
As we saw with the example of the house in winter,

10:14.000 --> 10:17.000
if one fire is constant, then the temperature rises and falls

10:17.000 --> 10:20.000
according to the output of the other.

10:20.000 --> 10:24.000
A study that looked at global temperatures over the last 1,150 years

10:24.000 --> 10:26.000
found exactly that.

10:26.000 --> 10:30.000
With carbon dioxide levels steady, the sun was the main driver of climate.

10:30.000 --> 10:34.000
But for the last 30 years, the output of the sun has been more or less constant.

10:34.000 --> 10:38.000
So as climatologists predicted, temperatures have risen concurrently

10:38.000 --> 10:43.000
with the rise in the other historical driver of climate, carbon dioxide.

10:43.000 --> 10:47.000
And to the other MOOC experts that make the obvious and rather puerile observation

10:47.000 --> 10:51.000
that the climate always changes, well, now you know why.
