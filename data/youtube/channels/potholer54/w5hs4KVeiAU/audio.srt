1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
Climate change is a natural phenomenon that has always been, but always will be.

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:08,000
Climate does change. It always has, and it always will.

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:13,000
Yes, OK, the climate changes. In science that's what's called an observation,

4
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:17,000
just as we can observe lightning, shooting stars and earthquakes.

5
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:22,000
They're all natural. But the role of scientists isn't to sit back and marvel at all these natural mysteries.

6
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:25,000
It's to find out why they happen.

7
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:29,000
So what climatologists want to know is what causes the climate to change.

8
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:33,000
And after two centuries of research, they now have a pretty good idea.

9
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:35,000
Let's just recap.

10
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:38,000
Insulation is the amount of energy we get from the Sun.

11
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:41,000
It depends not only on the energy output of the Sun,

12
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:46,000
but on how the Earth is positioned to receive it, its tilt and orbit.

13
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:50,000
Greenhouse gases, things like water vapour, carbon dioxide and methane.

14
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:55,000
And thirdly, particulates and aerosols. They come from volcanoes and meteorite impacts.

15
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:57,000
They block sunlight and cool the Earth down,

16
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:01,000
and aerosols caused by industrial pollution do the same thing.

17
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:05,000
Finally, the Earth itself can amplify these changes through positive feedback,

18
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:08,000
and even the configuration of the continents.

19
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,000
And so we come to our first urban myth,

20
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:14,000
which happened to pop up in the comments forum of one of my climate videos.

21
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:19,000
The myth is that since temperatures were higher in the past with lower CO2,

22
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:21,000
and sometimes lower with higher CO2,

23
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:24,000
carbon dioxide can't be a factor in climate change.

24
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:27,000
Even Bob Carter has fallen for this one.

25
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:30,000
Here's a graph he produced, apparently showing no correlation

26
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:33,000
between carbon dioxide and global temperatures

27
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:37,000
over the Phanerozoic, the last 500 million years of the Earth's history.

28
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:39,000
But I'm pretty sure on this one, Bob,

29
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:41,000
because it's in all the scientific literature.

30
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:43,000
You wouldn't expect to get a match-up

31
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:47,000
because carbon dioxide isn't the only factor that affects global temperatures.

32
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:51,000
No climatologist ever said it was. Just read the journals.

33
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:56,000
On a geological time scale, the Sun is the other main driver of climate.

34
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,000
And as every geologist should know,

35
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:01,000
solar output was much weaker in the deep past.

36
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:05,000
The red line here shows solar output throughout the Earth's history.

37
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:09,000
What we're interested in is the last 500 million years.

38
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:13,000
Like most stars, the Sun has been growing increasingly brighter with time.

39
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:16,000
If I compared solar irradiance with global temperatures

40
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,000
over the last half billion years,

41
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:22,000
I'd get no better a correlation than Carter did with carbon dioxide.

42
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:26,000
But if we combine the two, solar irradiation and carbon dioxide,

43
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:29,000
then there's a very good correlation.

44
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:31,000
I'll come back to this later,

45
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:35,000
but why is the correlation so good if there are all these other factors?

46
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:39,000
Well, the Earth's tilt and orbit are predictable and run in cycles.

47
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:42,000
The effect of particulates is usually short-lived.

48
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:45,000
And the concentration of water vapour is controlled by temperature,

49
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:49,000
so it acts as an amplifier rather than a prime driver of climate.

50
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:53,000
Over the long term, carbon dioxide and solar output, or irradiance,

51
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:55,000
are the biggest variables.

52
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:58,000
Let me put this very simply with an analogy.

53
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,000
Let's say you're staying in a house in mid-winter

54
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:04,000
and all you have to heat it with is a fireplace and an electric heater.

55
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,000
If they're both full-on, you'll bake,

56
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:09,000
and if they're both turned down very low, you'll freeze.

57
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:12,000
The house could even get cold if the fire's going nicely,

58
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,000
but the heater's turned down very low.

59
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:17,000
So the Earth's climate depends on a combination of factors,

60
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:19,000
and it's actually quite lucky for us

61
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:23,000
that carbon dioxide levels have generally fallen over geological time

62
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:26,000
to balance the growing irradiance of the Sun.

63
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:29,000
Two researchers who are sceptical of the influence of CO2

64
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:31,000
have put forward an alternative idea

65
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:35,000
that the Earth cools as it passes through the spiral arms of our galaxy.

66
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:40,000
The idea is that cosmic rays ionise the air and that seeds clouds,

67
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:44,000
and clouds reflect sunlight, and that cools the Earth down.

68
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:47,000
Shivivam Veda's paper has been widely circulated

69
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:51,000
but not widely accepted within the scientific community.

70
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:54,000
No, not because of some conspiracy of evil scientists,

71
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:57,000
but because the idea that cosmic rays seed clouds

72
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:00,000
and that clouds cool the climate hasn't been shown.

73
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,000
I explained the background to this in my video

74
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,000
Climate Change the Objections.

75
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:08,000
Also, geologists say there are problems with the dating method used

76
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,000
and with the correlation itself.

77
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:13,000
And as the authors themselves admit,

78
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:16,000
the hypothesis can't explain current climate change

79
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,000
because it takes millions of years for the Solar System

80
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,000
to pass through a spiral arm.

81
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:24,000
I'm very glad a couple of qualified sceptics who know their subject

82
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:27,000
chose to publish their research in a respected peer-reviewed journal.

83
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:30,000
That's how scientific procedure is supposed to work.

84
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:34,000
Unfortunately, Shiviv's university issued a press release at the same time

85
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:38,000
the paper was published, making claims that weren't in there.

86
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,000
Most journalists read the press release

87
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:42,000
and didn't bother to read the paper.

88
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:45,000
So the headline that went around the world was this one,

89
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:48,000
even though the paper says nothing of the sort.

90
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:52,000
In fact, it specifically argues against drawing inferences

91
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,000
about current climate change.

92
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:57,000
Shivivam Veda go on to say that other research suggests

93
00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:00,000
cosmic rays may also work on a smaller time scale,

94
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:03,000
but that hypothesis has since collapsed

95
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:05,000
because of a mathematical error,

96
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:09,000
which I explained in my video, Climate Change, the Objections.

97
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:12,000
So what we're left with are two very clear drivers of climate

98
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:16,000
that fit very well with the reconstruction of the Earth's climatic history.

99
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:20,000
From 2004 to 2006, researchers reviewed the scientific literature

100
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:24,000
and examined solar output, carbon dioxide levels and temperature data

101
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:27,000
from every period of the Phanerozoic,

102
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:29,000
from the Tertiary to the lower Ordovician.

103
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:32,000
And they found a very good correlation.

104
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:35,000
Critics say the correlation breaks down in two places,

105
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:37,000
the Ordovician and the Cretaceous periods,

106
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:42,000
when there were very high CO2 levels coinciding with extensive ice cover.

107
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:47,000
But of course we have to remember the climate isn't driven by carbon dioxide alone,

108
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:51,000
and at times even the combined influence of solar output and CO2 levels

109
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:54,000
can be upset by the other factors that affect climate.

110
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:58,000
The Ordovician seems to be a particular favourite with amateur sceptics

111
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:01,000
because it experienced a full-blown ice age.

112
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:06,000
I'm often referred to this website, run not by a climatologist, no surprise,

113
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:09,000
but by a mining engineer called Monty Hebe.

114
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:11,000
To the consternation of global warming proponents,

115
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:14,000
the late Ordovician period was also an ice age,

116
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:20,000
while at the same time CO2 concentrations then were nearly 12 times higher than today.

117
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:24,000
According to greenhouse theory, Earth should have been exceedingly hot, blah blah blah.

118
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:28,000
No, according to greenhouse theory, if you want to call it that,

119
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:33,000
global temperatures vary depending on several factors, not just carbon dioxide.

120
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:37,000
So let's go back over 20 years of research into the Ordovician climate

121
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:41,000
and see what real climate scientists have discovered.

122
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:44,000
First of all, solar output during the Ordovician was, of course,

123
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:48,000
much weaker than today, about 4.5% weaker.

124
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:51,000
That should have been enough to plunge the Earth into an ice age.

125
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:53,000
It certainly would today.

126
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:55,000
But in fact the climate was much hotter,

127
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:59,000
way beyond any forecast of what we're expecting in the next 100 years.

128
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:01,000
How can that be?

129
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:05,000
Well, paleoclimatologists have concluded it's because carbon dioxide levels

130
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:08,000
were around 18 times higher than today.

131
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:11,000
So if all that carbon dioxide was keeping the Earth hot,

132
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:14,000
why did it suddenly descend into an ice age?

133
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:18,000
This was a problem facing geologists over a decade ago.

134
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:21,000
The only way to cool the Earth down would have been to remove

135
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:24,000
billions of tonnes of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere.

136
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:26,000
But there was no known mechanism for that happening

137
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:29,000
over such a short period of time.

138
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:32,000
In 1994 geologists discovered that carbon dioxide levels

139
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:36,000
did indeed drop dramatically towards the end of the Ordovician.

140
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:38,000
The reason still wasn't clear.

141
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:40,000
Climatologists calculated that such a drop

142
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:42,000
would have caused global temperatures to fall,

143
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:45,000
but there was still more than enough CO2 in the atmosphere

144
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:47,000
to prevent an ice age.

145
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:51,000
Then in 1995 researchers from Texas A&M showed that

146
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:53,000
one other factor had come into play,

147
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:55,000
the position of the continents,

148
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:58,000
which had joined into a supercontinent near the South Pole.

149
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:01,000
They also concluded that the Earth's orbit might have played a role

150
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:04,000
in reducing solar irradiance even further.

151
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:07,000
Two years later researchers from Pennsylvania State University

152
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:10,000
calculated that all these factors put together,

153
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:13,000
including the drop in carbon dioxide levels,

154
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:16,000
would have been enough to precipitate an ice age.

155
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:19,000
Then in 1999 and 2005,

156
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:23,000
newspapers began to shed light on the reason carbon dioxide levels fell.

157
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:26,000
During the Ordovician, the Atlantic Oceanic crust

158
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:29,000
was subducting under the North American continent.

159
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:31,000
This thrust up the Appalachian Mountains.

160
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:36,000
As they rose, the silicate rocks in these newly formed mountains rapidly weathered.

161
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:39,000
This happens through a simple chemical process.

162
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:41,000
Carbon dioxide reacts with silicate rock,

163
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:44,000
forming calcium or magnesium carbonate.

164
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:46,000
This is washed away into the sea,

165
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:48,000
gets taken up by organisms in their shells,

166
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:52,000
and then gets buried as sediment that turns into limestone or chalk.

167
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:56,000
So the carbon that was once in the atmosphere got buried at sea,

168
00:08:56,000 --> 00:09:01,000
and over millions of years, trillions of tons of carbon were removed from the air.

169
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:04,000
So scientists are more than happy to talk about this U-boat 21.

170
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:08,000
In fact, they've been yakking about it for well over two decades.

171
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:10,000
It's just that you haven't noticed

172
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:13,000
because it's all been published in scientific journals.

173
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:17,000
These aren't inaccessible. You can find them quite easily online.

174
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:20,000
But they don't get passed around and re-pasted on internet blogs.

175
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:22,000
They require a bit of effort.

176
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:25,000
I suppose it's quicker and easier to read a blog by a mining engineer

177
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:28,000
and come away thinking you're an instant expert.

178
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:31,000
It's kind of the fast-food approach to science.

179
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:34,000
So all the Mc-experts who argue that the Earth was cold

180
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:37,000
when carbon dioxide levels were high

181
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:40,000
miss the equally irrelevant point that the Earth was much hotter than today

182
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:43,000
when solar output was much lower than today.

183
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:46,000
It's a combination of factors that drives our climate.

184
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:50,000
But a lot of people continue to think that the sun is acting alone.

185
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:54,000
None of the major climate changes in the last thousand years

186
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:57,000
can be explained by CO2.

187
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:59,000
Well, I can beat that.

188
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:03,000
None of the major climate changes in the last 1,150 years

189
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:05,000
can be explained by CO2.

190
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:07,000
And there's a very good reason for that.

191
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:11,000
CO2 levels have been more or less constant during that time.

192
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:14,000
As we saw with the example of the house in winter,

193
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:17,000
if one fire is constant, then the temperature rises and falls

194
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:20,000
according to the output of the other.

195
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:24,000
A study that looked at global temperatures over the last 1,150 years

196
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:26,000
found exactly that.

197
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:30,000
With carbon dioxide levels steady, the sun was the main driver of climate.

198
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:34,000
But for the last 30 years, the output of the sun has been more or less constant.

199
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:38,000
So as climatologists predicted, temperatures have risen concurrently

200
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:43,000
with the rise in the other historical driver of climate, carbon dioxide.

201
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:47,000
And to the other MOOC experts that make the obvious and rather puerile observation

202
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:51,000
that the climate always changes, well, now you know why.
