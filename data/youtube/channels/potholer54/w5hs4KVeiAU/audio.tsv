0	4000	Climate change is a natural phenomenon that has always been, but always will be.
4000	8000	Climate does change. It always has, and it always will.
8000	13000	Yes, OK, the climate changes. In science that's what's called an observation,
13000	17000	just as we can observe lightning, shooting stars and earthquakes.
17000	22000	They're all natural. But the role of scientists isn't to sit back and marvel at all these natural mysteries.
22000	25000	It's to find out why they happen.
25000	29000	So what climatologists want to know is what causes the climate to change.
29000	33000	And after two centuries of research, they now have a pretty good idea.
33000	35000	Let's just recap.
35000	38000	Insulation is the amount of energy we get from the Sun.
38000	41000	It depends not only on the energy output of the Sun,
41000	46000	but on how the Earth is positioned to receive it, its tilt and orbit.
46000	50000	Greenhouse gases, things like water vapour, carbon dioxide and methane.
50000	55000	And thirdly, particulates and aerosols. They come from volcanoes and meteorite impacts.
55000	57000	They block sunlight and cool the Earth down,
57000	61000	and aerosols caused by industrial pollution do the same thing.
61000	65000	Finally, the Earth itself can amplify these changes through positive feedback,
65000	68000	and even the configuration of the continents.
68000	70000	And so we come to our first urban myth,
70000	74000	which happened to pop up in the comments forum of one of my climate videos.
74000	79000	The myth is that since temperatures were higher in the past with lower CO2,
79000	81000	and sometimes lower with higher CO2,
81000	84000	carbon dioxide can't be a factor in climate change.
84000	87000	Even Bob Carter has fallen for this one.
87000	90000	Here's a graph he produced, apparently showing no correlation
90000	93000	between carbon dioxide and global temperatures
93000	97000	over the Phanerozoic, the last 500 million years of the Earth's history.
97000	99000	But I'm pretty sure on this one, Bob,
99000	101000	because it's in all the scientific literature.
101000	103000	You wouldn't expect to get a match-up
103000	107000	because carbon dioxide isn't the only factor that affects global temperatures.
107000	111000	No climatologist ever said it was. Just read the journals.
112000	116000	On a geological time scale, the Sun is the other main driver of climate.
116000	118000	And as every geologist should know,
118000	121000	solar output was much weaker in the deep past.
121000	125000	The red line here shows solar output throughout the Earth's history.
125000	129000	What we're interested in is the last 500 million years.
129000	133000	Like most stars, the Sun has been growing increasingly brighter with time.
133000	136000	If I compared solar irradiance with global temperatures
136000	138000	over the last half billion years,
138000	142000	I'd get no better a correlation than Carter did with carbon dioxide.
142000	146000	But if we combine the two, solar irradiation and carbon dioxide,
146000	149000	then there's a very good correlation.
149000	151000	I'll come back to this later,
151000	155000	but why is the correlation so good if there are all these other factors?
155000	159000	Well, the Earth's tilt and orbit are predictable and run in cycles.
159000	162000	The effect of particulates is usually short-lived.
162000	165000	And the concentration of water vapour is controlled by temperature,
165000	169000	so it acts as an amplifier rather than a prime driver of climate.
169000	173000	Over the long term, carbon dioxide and solar output, or irradiance,
173000	175000	are the biggest variables.
175000	178000	Let me put this very simply with an analogy.
178000	180000	Let's say you're staying in a house in mid-winter
180000	184000	and all you have to heat it with is a fireplace and an electric heater.
184000	186000	If they're both full-on, you'll bake,
186000	189000	and if they're both turned down very low, you'll freeze.
189000	192000	The house could even get cold if the fire's going nicely,
192000	194000	but the heater's turned down very low.
194000	197000	So the Earth's climate depends on a combination of factors,
197000	199000	and it's actually quite lucky for us
199000	203000	that carbon dioxide levels have generally fallen over geological time
203000	206000	to balance the growing irradiance of the Sun.
206000	209000	Two researchers who are sceptical of the influence of CO2
209000	211000	have put forward an alternative idea
211000	215000	that the Earth cools as it passes through the spiral arms of our galaxy.
215000	220000	The idea is that cosmic rays ionise the air and that seeds clouds,
220000	224000	and clouds reflect sunlight, and that cools the Earth down.
224000	227000	Shivivam Veda's paper has been widely circulated
227000	231000	but not widely accepted within the scientific community.
231000	234000	No, not because of some conspiracy of evil scientists,
234000	237000	but because the idea that cosmic rays seed clouds
237000	240000	and that clouds cool the climate hasn't been shown.
240000	242000	I explained the background to this in my video
242000	244000	Climate Change the Objections.
244000	248000	Also, geologists say there are problems with the dating method used
248000	250000	and with the correlation itself.
250000	253000	And as the authors themselves admit,
253000	256000	the hypothesis can't explain current climate change
256000	258000	because it takes millions of years for the Solar System
258000	260000	to pass through a spiral arm.
260000	264000	I'm very glad a couple of qualified sceptics who know their subject
264000	267000	chose to publish their research in a respected peer-reviewed journal.
267000	270000	That's how scientific procedure is supposed to work.
270000	274000	Unfortunately, Shiviv's university issued a press release at the same time
274000	278000	the paper was published, making claims that weren't in there.
278000	280000	Most journalists read the press release
280000	282000	and didn't bother to read the paper.
282000	285000	So the headline that went around the world was this one,
285000	288000	even though the paper says nothing of the sort.
288000	292000	In fact, it specifically argues against drawing inferences
292000	294000	about current climate change.
294000	297000	Shivivam Veda go on to say that other research suggests
297000	300000	cosmic rays may also work on a smaller time scale,
300000	303000	but that hypothesis has since collapsed
303000	305000	because of a mathematical error,
305000	309000	which I explained in my video, Climate Change, the Objections.
309000	312000	So what we're left with are two very clear drivers of climate
312000	316000	that fit very well with the reconstruction of the Earth's climatic history.
316000	320000	From 2004 to 2006, researchers reviewed the scientific literature
320000	324000	and examined solar output, carbon dioxide levels and temperature data
324000	327000	from every period of the Phanerozoic,
327000	329000	from the Tertiary to the lower Ordovician.
329000	332000	And they found a very good correlation.
332000	335000	Critics say the correlation breaks down in two places,
335000	337000	the Ordovician and the Cretaceous periods,
337000	342000	when there were very high CO2 levels coinciding with extensive ice cover.
342000	347000	But of course we have to remember the climate isn't driven by carbon dioxide alone,
347000	351000	and at times even the combined influence of solar output and CO2 levels
351000	354000	can be upset by the other factors that affect climate.
354000	358000	The Ordovician seems to be a particular favourite with amateur sceptics
358000	361000	because it experienced a full-blown ice age.
361000	366000	I'm often referred to this website, run not by a climatologist, no surprise,
366000	369000	but by a mining engineer called Monty Hebe.
369000	371000	To the consternation of global warming proponents,
371000	374000	the late Ordovician period was also an ice age,
374000	380000	while at the same time CO2 concentrations then were nearly 12 times higher than today.
380000	384000	According to greenhouse theory, Earth should have been exceedingly hot, blah blah blah.
384000	388000	No, according to greenhouse theory, if you want to call it that,
388000	393000	global temperatures vary depending on several factors, not just carbon dioxide.
393000	397000	So let's go back over 20 years of research into the Ordovician climate
397000	401000	and see what real climate scientists have discovered.
401000	404000	First of all, solar output during the Ordovician was, of course,
404000	408000	much weaker than today, about 4.5% weaker.
408000	411000	That should have been enough to plunge the Earth into an ice age.
411000	413000	It certainly would today.
413000	415000	But in fact the climate was much hotter,
415000	419000	way beyond any forecast of what we're expecting in the next 100 years.
419000	421000	How can that be?
421000	425000	Well, paleoclimatologists have concluded it's because carbon dioxide levels
425000	428000	were around 18 times higher than today.
428000	431000	So if all that carbon dioxide was keeping the Earth hot,
431000	434000	why did it suddenly descend into an ice age?
434000	438000	This was a problem facing geologists over a decade ago.
438000	441000	The only way to cool the Earth down would have been to remove
441000	444000	billions of tonnes of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere.
444000	446000	But there was no known mechanism for that happening
446000	449000	over such a short period of time.
449000	452000	In 1994 geologists discovered that carbon dioxide levels
452000	456000	did indeed drop dramatically towards the end of the Ordovician.
456000	458000	The reason still wasn't clear.
458000	460000	Climatologists calculated that such a drop
460000	462000	would have caused global temperatures to fall,
462000	465000	but there was still more than enough CO2 in the atmosphere
465000	467000	to prevent an ice age.
467000	471000	Then in 1995 researchers from Texas A&M showed that
471000	473000	one other factor had come into play,
473000	475000	the position of the continents,
475000	478000	which had joined into a supercontinent near the South Pole.
478000	481000	They also concluded that the Earth's orbit might have played a role
481000	484000	in reducing solar irradiance even further.
484000	487000	Two years later researchers from Pennsylvania State University
487000	490000	calculated that all these factors put together,
490000	493000	including the drop in carbon dioxide levels,
493000	496000	would have been enough to precipitate an ice age.
496000	499000	Then in 1999 and 2005,
499000	503000	newspapers began to shed light on the reason carbon dioxide levels fell.
503000	506000	During the Ordovician, the Atlantic Oceanic crust
506000	509000	was subducting under the North American continent.
509000	511000	This thrust up the Appalachian Mountains.
511000	516000	As they rose, the silicate rocks in these newly formed mountains rapidly weathered.
516000	519000	This happens through a simple chemical process.
519000	521000	Carbon dioxide reacts with silicate rock,
521000	524000	forming calcium or magnesium carbonate.
524000	526000	This is washed away into the sea,
526000	528000	gets taken up by organisms in their shells,
528000	532000	and then gets buried as sediment that turns into limestone or chalk.
532000	536000	So the carbon that was once in the atmosphere got buried at sea,
536000	541000	and over millions of years, trillions of tons of carbon were removed from the air.
541000	544000	So scientists are more than happy to talk about this U-boat 21.
544000	548000	In fact, they've been yakking about it for well over two decades.
548000	550000	It's just that you haven't noticed
550000	553000	because it's all been published in scientific journals.
553000	557000	These aren't inaccessible. You can find them quite easily online.
557000	560000	But they don't get passed around and re-pasted on internet blogs.
560000	562000	They require a bit of effort.
562000	565000	I suppose it's quicker and easier to read a blog by a mining engineer
565000	568000	and come away thinking you're an instant expert.
568000	571000	It's kind of the fast-food approach to science.
571000	574000	So all the Mc-experts who argue that the Earth was cold
574000	577000	when carbon dioxide levels were high
577000	580000	miss the equally irrelevant point that the Earth was much hotter than today
580000	583000	when solar output was much lower than today.
583000	586000	It's a combination of factors that drives our climate.
586000	590000	But a lot of people continue to think that the sun is acting alone.
590000	594000	None of the major climate changes in the last thousand years
594000	597000	can be explained by CO2.
597000	599000	Well, I can beat that.
599000	603000	None of the major climate changes in the last 1,150 years
603000	605000	can be explained by CO2.
605000	607000	And there's a very good reason for that.
607000	611000	CO2 levels have been more or less constant during that time.
611000	614000	As we saw with the example of the house in winter,
614000	617000	if one fire is constant, then the temperature rises and falls
617000	620000	according to the output of the other.
620000	624000	A study that looked at global temperatures over the last 1,150 years
624000	626000	found exactly that.
626000	630000	With carbon dioxide levels steady, the sun was the main driver of climate.
630000	634000	But for the last 30 years, the output of the sun has been more or less constant.
634000	638000	So as climatologists predicted, temperatures have risen concurrently
638000	643000	with the rise in the other historical driver of climate, carbon dioxide.
643000	647000	And to the other MOOC experts that make the obvious and rather puerile observation
647000	651000	that the climate always changes, well, now you know why.
