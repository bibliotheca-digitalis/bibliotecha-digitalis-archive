0	5640	Recently, Ken Ham and Bill Nye held a debate about whether creationism is a viable model
5640	11360	of origins. I won't go into an analysis, it was far too long, and I've written an overview
11360	17220	anyway on the Pothola54 Facebook page. What I thought worth addressing was Ken Ham's attempt
17220	19360	to redefine the word science.
19360	23400	What is science? Well, the origin of the word comes from the classical Latin scientia, which
23400	28920	means to know. There's experimental observational science, as we call it. That's using the scientific
28960	32080	method. Observation, measurement, experiment, testing.
32080	36920	Ah, that's fine. That's the definition most scientists would generally accept. Science
36920	42600	is knowledge, but it's knowledge gained through the scientific method. In short, observation
42600	47320	and inference. And the tenets of the scientific method are exactly the same whether you're
47320	53600	a geologist, a botanist, or a space physicist. But then Ham tries to overturn the way science
53600	58080	has been practiced for hundreds of years in just about every scientific discipline in
58080	63200	every country in the world. It's a bit ambitious, but let's see how he goes.
63200	66060	There's experimental observational science, as we call it.
66060	71240	Let me stop you there, Ken. As you call it. So we've established up front that this is
71240	77320	a name you've come up with. As far as scientists are concerned, all science is observational.
77320	83120	So coming up with the name observational science is like coining the term moving NASCAR. So
83120	88040	now Ham is going to try to drive a wedge between the sciences that are indifferent to his belief
88040	93920	beliefs, like software engineering, and those that contradict the Bible, like geology, biology,
93920	98040	and astronomy. The first thing he does is make up another new term.
98040	102880	When you're talking about the past, we like to call that origins or historical science.
102880	109720	So we like to call that origins or historical science. Just checking.
109720	114760	Public school textbooks are using the same word science for observational science and
114760	115760	historical science.
115760	121720	Yes, Ken, because to the public school system and to universities and to scientific institutions
121720	128560	worldwide there's no distinction between what you call observational and historical science.
128560	134780	All science is observational, including those disciplines you've labelled historical.
134780	140080	We can't observe the Earth orbiting the Sun, but we can infer it from observations of the
140080	145560	retrograde motion of Mars and the phases of Venus. We can't observe the structure of the
145560	152300	atom or what causes an earthquake, but we can infer these things through other observations.
152300	158080	No scientific theory, from heliocentric theory to atomic theory to plate tectonic theory,
158080	163880	has ever been observed. It's been inferred from thousands of observations.
163880	168400	So paleontology, the scientific discipline that charts evolution over hundreds of millions
168400	175120	of years, is based on observation and inference, just like every other science. Paleontologists
175120	181280	weren't there 68 million years ago to observe this Triceratops, but we can observe its fossil
181280	186920	remains and we can observe footprints, eggs and fossilised faeces of dinosaurs like this
186920	191360	to know how they lived, what they ate, and from the ground they walked on, what sort
191360	197200	of environment they inhabited. Paleontologists also observe very carefully the changes in
197200	203200	morphology of fossil organisms moving up through geological layers of rock in which the organisms
203200	210040	were buried. And whether the layers are thousands or millions of years old, either way, paleontologists
210040	215320	can make the obvious inference that the organism is changing over time.
215320	220680	But according to the historical science argument, paleontologists can't use the evidence they
220680	226280	observed to make these inferences because they weren't physically there. And then someone
226280	232100	came forward in the debate to refute all that. Ken Ham's argument was brilliantly and successfully
232100	234740	demolished by Ken Ham.
234740	238660	We would say as creationists, and we have many creation scientists who research this
238660	243980	and for lots of reasons, I would say the kind in Genesis 1 really is more at the family
243980	249140	level of classification. For instance, there's one dog kind, there's one cat kind, even though
249140	253500	you have different genera, different species. And you see, based on the biblical account
253500	258180	there in Genesis 1, creationists have drawn up what they believe is a creation orchard.
258180	263140	In other words, they're saying, look, there's great variation in the genetics of dogs and
263140	268340	finches and so on. And so over time, particularly after Noah's flood, you'd expect if there
268340	272500	were two dogs, for instance, you could end up with different species of dogs, as there's
272500	276860	an incredible amount of variability in the genes of any creature.
276860	283100	So what's Ken Ham just done? He's used observations of animals today, the observation that there's
283100	287680	a wide variety of them, the observation that similar animal species are morphologically
287680	293400	similar, the observation that each offspring has a different genetic makeup to its parents.
293400	299200	He's used all these observations to make an inference about what happened in the past.
299200	303660	He's even got a drawing of a triceratops, which means he accepts they once roamed the
303660	309720	earth along with other dinosaurs, and he only reached that conclusion based on observations
309720	315400	of fossilised bones. No, he didn't get all this from the Bible, the idea that the different
315400	320920	kinds evolved into the wide variety of organisms we see today through natural selection is
320920	327160	something Ham tells us he and his team of researchers have come up with through observation.
327160	332020	And he certainly didn't get his detailed understanding of the triceratops from the Bible, he got
332020	337580	it from the fossil record. The only part of this picture Ken Ham got from the Bible was
337580	342480	his starting point, the blind belief that two of each kind of animal emerged from an
342480	349040	ark 4000 years ago. So since Ham accepts that observations can indeed tell us what happened
349040	354400	in the past, then observations from the fossil record showing no such sudden appearance of
354400	360800	animal families override that blind belief. That's why creationism isn't a viable model
360800	367800	Ken, as you admit it's based on belief, and as you yourself said, science has to be based
367800	369000	on observation.
