00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,640
Recently, Ken Ham and Bill Nye held a debate about whether creationism is a viable model

2
00:00:05,640 --> 00:00:11,360
of origins. I won't go into an analysis, it was far too long, and I've written an overview

3
00:00:11,360 --> 00:00:17,220
anyway on the Pothola54 Facebook page. What I thought worth addressing was Ken Ham's attempt

4
00:00:17,220 --> 00:00:19,360
to redefine the word science.

5
00:00:19,360 --> 00:00:23,400
What is science? Well, the origin of the word comes from the classical Latin scientia, which

6
00:00:23,400 --> 00:00:28,920
means to know. There's experimental observational science, as we call it. That's using the scientific

7
00:00:28,960 --> 00:00:32,080
method. Observation, measurement, experiment, testing.

8
00:00:32,080 --> 00:00:36,920
Ah, that's fine. That's the definition most scientists would generally accept. Science

9
00:00:36,920 --> 00:00:42,600
is knowledge, but it's knowledge gained through the scientific method. In short, observation

10
00:00:42,600 --> 00:00:47,320
and inference. And the tenets of the scientific method are exactly the same whether you're

11
00:00:47,320 --> 00:00:53,600
a geologist, a botanist, or a space physicist. But then Ham tries to overturn the way science

12
00:00:53,600 --> 00:00:58,080
has been practiced for hundreds of years in just about every scientific discipline in

13
00:00:58,080 --> 00:01:03,200
every country in the world. It's a bit ambitious, but let's see how he goes.

14
00:01:03,200 --> 00:01:06,060
There's experimental observational science, as we call it.

15
00:01:06,060 --> 00:01:11,240
Let me stop you there, Ken. As you call it. So we've established up front that this is

16
00:01:11,240 --> 00:01:17,320
a name you've come up with. As far as scientists are concerned, all science is observational.

17
00:01:17,320 --> 00:01:23,120
So coming up with the name observational science is like coining the term moving NASCAR. So

18
00:01:23,120 --> 00:01:28,040
now Ham is going to try to drive a wedge between the sciences that are indifferent to his belief

19
00:01:28,040 --> 00:01:33,920
beliefs, like software engineering, and those that contradict the Bible, like geology, biology,

20
00:01:33,920 --> 00:01:38,040
and astronomy. The first thing he does is make up another new term.

21
00:01:38,040 --> 00:01:42,880
When you're talking about the past, we like to call that origins or historical science.

22
00:01:42,880 --> 00:01:49,720
So we like to call that origins or historical science. Just checking.

23
00:01:49,720 --> 00:01:54,760
Public school textbooks are using the same word science for observational science and

24
00:01:54,760 --> 00:01:55,760
historical science.

25
00:01:55,760 --> 00:02:01,720
Yes, Ken, because to the public school system and to universities and to scientific institutions

26
00:02:01,720 --> 00:02:08,560
worldwide there's no distinction between what you call observational and historical science.

27
00:02:08,560 --> 00:02:14,780
All science is observational, including those disciplines you've labelled historical.

28
00:02:14,780 --> 00:02:20,080
We can't observe the Earth orbiting the Sun, but we can infer it from observations of the

29
00:02:20,080 --> 00:02:25,560
retrograde motion of Mars and the phases of Venus. We can't observe the structure of the

30
00:02:25,560 --> 00:02:32,300
atom or what causes an earthquake, but we can infer these things through other observations.

31
00:02:32,300 --> 00:02:38,080
No scientific theory, from heliocentric theory to atomic theory to plate tectonic theory,

32
00:02:38,080 --> 00:02:43,880
has ever been observed. It's been inferred from thousands of observations.

33
00:02:43,880 --> 00:02:48,400
So paleontology, the scientific discipline that charts evolution over hundreds of millions

34
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:55,120
of years, is based on observation and inference, just like every other science. Paleontologists

35
00:02:55,120 --> 00:03:01,280
weren't there 68 million years ago to observe this Triceratops, but we can observe its fossil

36
00:03:01,280 --> 00:03:06,920
remains and we can observe footprints, eggs and fossilised faeces of dinosaurs like this

37
00:03:06,920 --> 00:03:11,360
to know how they lived, what they ate, and from the ground they walked on, what sort

38
00:03:11,360 --> 00:03:17,200
of environment they inhabited. Paleontologists also observe very carefully the changes in

39
00:03:17,200 --> 00:03:23,200
morphology of fossil organisms moving up through geological layers of rock in which the organisms

40
00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:30,040
were buried. And whether the layers are thousands or millions of years old, either way, paleontologists

41
00:03:30,040 --> 00:03:35,320
can make the obvious inference that the organism is changing over time.

42
00:03:35,320 --> 00:03:40,680
But according to the historical science argument, paleontologists can't use the evidence they

43
00:03:40,680 --> 00:03:46,280
observed to make these inferences because they weren't physically there. And then someone

44
00:03:46,280 --> 00:03:52,100
came forward in the debate to refute all that. Ken Ham's argument was brilliantly and successfully

45
00:03:52,100 --> 00:03:54,740
demolished by Ken Ham.

46
00:03:54,740 --> 00:03:58,660
We would say as creationists, and we have many creation scientists who research this

47
00:03:58,660 --> 00:04:03,980
and for lots of reasons, I would say the kind in Genesis 1 really is more at the family

48
00:04:03,980 --> 00:04:09,140
level of classification. For instance, there's one dog kind, there's one cat kind, even though

49
00:04:09,140 --> 00:04:13,500
you have different genera, different species. And you see, based on the biblical account

50
00:04:13,500 --> 00:04:18,180
there in Genesis 1, creationists have drawn up what they believe is a creation orchard.

51
00:04:18,180 --> 00:04:23,140
In other words, they're saying, look, there's great variation in the genetics of dogs and

52
00:04:23,140 --> 00:04:28,340
finches and so on. And so over time, particularly after Noah's flood, you'd expect if there

53
00:04:28,340 --> 00:04:32,500
were two dogs, for instance, you could end up with different species of dogs, as there's

54
00:04:32,500 --> 00:04:36,860
an incredible amount of variability in the genes of any creature.

55
00:04:36,860 --> 00:04:43,100
So what's Ken Ham just done? He's used observations of animals today, the observation that there's

56
00:04:43,100 --> 00:04:47,680
a wide variety of them, the observation that similar animal species are morphologically

57
00:04:47,680 --> 00:04:53,400
similar, the observation that each offspring has a different genetic makeup to its parents.

58
00:04:53,400 --> 00:04:59,200
He's used all these observations to make an inference about what happened in the past.

59
00:04:59,200 --> 00:05:03,660
He's even got a drawing of a triceratops, which means he accepts they once roamed the

60
00:05:03,660 --> 00:05:09,720
earth along with other dinosaurs, and he only reached that conclusion based on observations

61
00:05:09,720 --> 00:05:15,400
of fossilised bones. No, he didn't get all this from the Bible, the idea that the different

62
00:05:15,400 --> 00:05:20,920
kinds evolved into the wide variety of organisms we see today through natural selection is

63
00:05:20,920 --> 00:05:27,160
something Ham tells us he and his team of researchers have come up with through observation.

64
00:05:27,160 --> 00:05:32,020
And he certainly didn't get his detailed understanding of the triceratops from the Bible, he got

65
00:05:32,020 --> 00:05:37,580
it from the fossil record. The only part of this picture Ken Ham got from the Bible was

66
00:05:37,580 --> 00:05:42,480
his starting point, the blind belief that two of each kind of animal emerged from an

67
00:05:42,480 --> 00:05:49,040
ark 4000 years ago. So since Ham accepts that observations can indeed tell us what happened

68
00:05:49,040 --> 00:05:54,400
in the past, then observations from the fossil record showing no such sudden appearance of

69
00:05:54,400 --> 00:06:00,800
animal families override that blind belief. That's why creationism isn't a viable model

70
00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:07,800
Ken, as you admit it's based on belief, and as you yourself said, science has to be based

71
00:06:07,800 --> 00:06:09,000
on observation.
