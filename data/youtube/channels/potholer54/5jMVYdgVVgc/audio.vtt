00:00.000 --> 00:05.640
Recently, Ken Ham and Bill Nye held a debate about whether creationism is a viable model

00:05.640 --> 00:11.360
of origins. I won't go into an analysis, it was far too long, and I've written an overview

00:11.360 --> 00:17.220
anyway on the Pothola54 Facebook page. What I thought worth addressing was Ken Ham's attempt

00:17.220 --> 00:19.360
to redefine the word science.

00:19.360 --> 00:23.400
What is science? Well, the origin of the word comes from the classical Latin scientia, which

00:23.400 --> 00:28.920
means to know. There's experimental observational science, as we call it. That's using the scientific

00:28.960 --> 00:32.080
method. Observation, measurement, experiment, testing.

00:32.080 --> 00:36.920
Ah, that's fine. That's the definition most scientists would generally accept. Science

00:36.920 --> 00:42.600
is knowledge, but it's knowledge gained through the scientific method. In short, observation

00:42.600 --> 00:47.320
and inference. And the tenets of the scientific method are exactly the same whether you're

00:47.320 --> 00:53.600
a geologist, a botanist, or a space physicist. But then Ham tries to overturn the way science

00:53.600 --> 00:58.080
has been practiced for hundreds of years in just about every scientific discipline in

00:58.080 --> 01:03.200
every country in the world. It's a bit ambitious, but let's see how he goes.

01:03.200 --> 01:06.060
There's experimental observational science, as we call it.

01:06.060 --> 01:11.240
Let me stop you there, Ken. As you call it. So we've established up front that this is

01:11.240 --> 01:17.320
a name you've come up with. As far as scientists are concerned, all science is observational.

01:17.320 --> 01:23.120
So coming up with the name observational science is like coining the term moving NASCAR. So

01:23.120 --> 01:28.040
now Ham is going to try to drive a wedge between the sciences that are indifferent to his belief

01:28.040 --> 01:33.920
beliefs, like software engineering, and those that contradict the Bible, like geology, biology,

01:33.920 --> 01:38.040
and astronomy. The first thing he does is make up another new term.

01:38.040 --> 01:42.880
When you're talking about the past, we like to call that origins or historical science.

01:42.880 --> 01:49.720
So we like to call that origins or historical science. Just checking.

01:49.720 --> 01:54.760
Public school textbooks are using the same word science for observational science and

01:54.760 --> 01:55.760
historical science.

01:55.760 --> 02:01.720
Yes, Ken, because to the public school system and to universities and to scientific institutions

02:01.720 --> 02:08.560
worldwide there's no distinction between what you call observational and historical science.

02:08.560 --> 02:14.780
All science is observational, including those disciplines you've labelled historical.

02:14.780 --> 02:20.080
We can't observe the Earth orbiting the Sun, but we can infer it from observations of the

02:20.080 --> 02:25.560
retrograde motion of Mars and the phases of Venus. We can't observe the structure of the

02:25.560 --> 02:32.300
atom or what causes an earthquake, but we can infer these things through other observations.

02:32.300 --> 02:38.080
No scientific theory, from heliocentric theory to atomic theory to plate tectonic theory,

02:38.080 --> 02:43.880
has ever been observed. It's been inferred from thousands of observations.

02:43.880 --> 02:48.400
So paleontology, the scientific discipline that charts evolution over hundreds of millions

02:48.400 --> 02:55.120
of years, is based on observation and inference, just like every other science. Paleontologists

02:55.120 --> 03:01.280
weren't there 68 million years ago to observe this Triceratops, but we can observe its fossil

03:01.280 --> 03:06.920
remains and we can observe footprints, eggs and fossilised faeces of dinosaurs like this

03:06.920 --> 03:11.360
to know how they lived, what they ate, and from the ground they walked on, what sort

03:11.360 --> 03:17.200
of environment they inhabited. Paleontologists also observe very carefully the changes in

03:17.200 --> 03:23.200
morphology of fossil organisms moving up through geological layers of rock in which the organisms

03:23.200 --> 03:30.040
were buried. And whether the layers are thousands or millions of years old, either way, paleontologists

03:30.040 --> 03:35.320
can make the obvious inference that the organism is changing over time.

03:35.320 --> 03:40.680
But according to the historical science argument, paleontologists can't use the evidence they

03:40.680 --> 03:46.280
observed to make these inferences because they weren't physically there. And then someone

03:46.280 --> 03:52.100
came forward in the debate to refute all that. Ken Ham's argument was brilliantly and successfully

03:52.100 --> 03:54.740
demolished by Ken Ham.

03:54.740 --> 03:58.660
We would say as creationists, and we have many creation scientists who research this

03:58.660 --> 04:03.980
and for lots of reasons, I would say the kind in Genesis 1 really is more at the family

04:03.980 --> 04:09.140
level of classification. For instance, there's one dog kind, there's one cat kind, even though

04:09.140 --> 04:13.500
you have different genera, different species. And you see, based on the biblical account

04:13.500 --> 04:18.180
there in Genesis 1, creationists have drawn up what they believe is a creation orchard.

04:18.180 --> 04:23.140
In other words, they're saying, look, there's great variation in the genetics of dogs and

04:23.140 --> 04:28.340
finches and so on. And so over time, particularly after Noah's flood, you'd expect if there

04:28.340 --> 04:32.500
were two dogs, for instance, you could end up with different species of dogs, as there's

04:32.500 --> 04:36.860
an incredible amount of variability in the genes of any creature.

04:36.860 --> 04:43.100
So what's Ken Ham just done? He's used observations of animals today, the observation that there's

04:43.100 --> 04:47.680
a wide variety of them, the observation that similar animal species are morphologically

04:47.680 --> 04:53.400
similar, the observation that each offspring has a different genetic makeup to its parents.

04:53.400 --> 04:59.200
He's used all these observations to make an inference about what happened in the past.

04:59.200 --> 05:03.660
He's even got a drawing of a triceratops, which means he accepts they once roamed the

05:03.660 --> 05:09.720
earth along with other dinosaurs, and he only reached that conclusion based on observations

05:09.720 --> 05:15.400
of fossilised bones. No, he didn't get all this from the Bible, the idea that the different

05:15.400 --> 05:20.920
kinds evolved into the wide variety of organisms we see today through natural selection is

05:20.920 --> 05:27.160
something Ham tells us he and his team of researchers have come up with through observation.

05:27.160 --> 05:32.020
And he certainly didn't get his detailed understanding of the triceratops from the Bible, he got

05:32.020 --> 05:37.580
it from the fossil record. The only part of this picture Ken Ham got from the Bible was

05:37.580 --> 05:42.480
his starting point, the blind belief that two of each kind of animal emerged from an

05:42.480 --> 05:49.040
ark 4000 years ago. So since Ham accepts that observations can indeed tell us what happened

05:49.040 --> 05:54.400
in the past, then observations from the fossil record showing no such sudden appearance of

05:54.400 --> 06:00.800
animal families override that blind belief. That's why creationism isn't a viable model

06:00.800 --> 06:07.800
Ken, as you admit it's based on belief, and as you yourself said, science has to be based

06:07.800 --> 06:09.000
on observation.
