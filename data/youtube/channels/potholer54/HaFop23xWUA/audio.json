{"text": " I saw these angels taking up positions everywhere in the day what to the real I didn't really know you nearly holding on Sunday huge mighty angel over the Pacific Ocean Pacific Samara Samara Kim a the South China Sea region there could see in a couple of you let me accurately tell you where exactly in geographical position he station who all are really young they adapt in the day what to the if you guess that these angels have something to do with the end of the world of course you'd be right YouTube profits have been working overtime to explain that an increasing number of earthquakes taking place around the world is a harbinger of end times now it's easy to ridicule these people and make fun of their sincerely-held beliefs so here we go preparing for this whether you believe it or not you know the Bible warns us of course of the increasing number of earthquakes right as the return of the Lord draws near as the day of the Lord draws near right that you're going to see increasing number of earthquakes now we've already seen the quake and then we've had a second quake now right with a different epicenter in Japan okay that's two so the obvious question to ask is are we really seeing an increasing number of earthquakes not one single creationist televangelist or self-proclaimed profit bother to even ask this question or check to see if their premise is correct so I suppose I'll have to do it for them the United States Geological Survey keeps tabs on the number of earthquakes worldwide and no surprise it turns out that earthquakes of magnitude 7 or greater have remained fairly constant the perception that there are more earthquakes may be the result of more numerous and accurate seismometers as the USGS suggests but it may also be because the worldwide reach of satellites and television news means creationists are more aware of what's going on in the world beyond the moonshine still and the hay barn it would help if their understanding of the past equally extended beyond the most recent hoedown while instruments weren't around to record the Shenzi earthquake in China it killed eight hundred and thirty thousand people on that scale this should have been the mother of all harbingers of the end of times except that the world didn't end the earthquake happened in 1556 230,000 people were killed in an earthquake near Aleppo Syria and the world didn't end then either in 1138 around 200,000 died in an earthquake in Iran in 856 a hundred thousand in China in 1290 none of this seems to have ended the world and the activity has not got any worse earthquakes are caused by the movement of tectonic plates when two plates get jammed stress accumulates and when the jam is broken the plates move suddenly and cause an earthquake that isn't to say there isn't some pattern to all this earthquake activity because movement along one section of a plate boundary will put stress on the plate borders either side of it a phenomenon known as stress transfer a very clear example of this pattern was found by researchers Stein Barker and Dietrich along the North Anatolian fault line in Turkey an earthquake at the eastern end of the fault line transfers stress further west triggering another earthquake years later over years and decades these earthquakes March inevitably westwards there may even be an external cause that triggers seemingly unconnected earthquakes in different parts of the world because although the cause of large earthquakes is crustal movement many faults around the world are under great stress and close to rupturing so it doesn't take much to trigger them telesysmic waves for example which travel through several plates and even global weather patterns research shows that a sudden drop in atmospheric pressure can trigger earthquakes but it still doesn't mean Danny Glover was right when he said the Haiti earthquake was caused by global warming there's also the tidal effect of the moon's gravitational attraction which moves the Earth's crust as well as the oceans there are still a lot of unknowns that may cause earthquakes to cluster in different parts of the world over a period of years but according to the USGS there's still no unusual pattern of earthquakes occurring so far this century compared to the long term we just have to give thanks to God that there's no one did I mean there's lots of damage to property everybody agrees normally when you when you hear of earthquakes you look at people going through rubble looking for dead living persons and dead persons and this has to be one of the wonders of the world that of course was after the so-called miracle earthquake that hit Christchurch last year a few months later another earthquake hit the city and nearly 200 people were killed for some reason Bishop Jones didn't go on television again to talk about the wonders of the Lord or his pious interpretation of seismic geology Glenn Beck on the other hand well here's what he thought President Obama should say when the Japanese earthquake struck in March my fellow Americans I know that you like me are heartbroken over what the people in Japan are enduring right now it was a massive earthquake 9.0 you know it you can't avoid it you've seen it everywhere it's one of the largest earthquakes on our planet's history of course it's not our planet has been through much bigger earthquakes but no one can fault the sentiment anyway that's what Beck said when pretending to be the president here's what Beck said about the Japanese earthquake when he was playing himself I'm not saying God is you know causing earthquakes well I'm not saying that I'm not not saying that either God what God does is God's business I have no idea but I'll tell you this whether you call it Gaia or whether you call it Jesus there's a message being sent and that is hey you know that stuff we're doing not really working out real well maybe we should stop doing some of it I'm just saying well Glenn if earthquakes are a punishment to mankind for our sin then why are the only people being punished those who live near seismically active fault lines does human wickedness only happen along the edges of crustal plates if earthquakes are a sign of anything they're a sign that crustal plates are continuing to move just as they have for millions of years and the Earth's geology is pretty much the same as it's been since the Cambrian if anything was going to herald some supernatural end of the world it would surely be if the Earth's crustal plates stopped moving and we got no earthquakes but earthquakes aren't the only sign of impending doom apparently all sorts of nasty things are now going on in the world we have these natural disasters we have people murdering each other we wow that's a hurdle the parents killing their children you can't even keep up with what's going on anymore we have this economic problems all over the world yep this never happened before these things are going to get worse spill it again worse and again worse okay okay that's enough signs of judgment day the end times the Sean Connery impersonator is right just listen in the near future ignoramus is amongst profuse knowledge unjust wars and earthquakes will increase wealth promiscuity and unheard of diseases will spread and good manners and family ties will cease a slave girl will give birth to her future master the moon will appear bigger women will outnumber men 50 to 1 and wild animals will speak foot odor will become a sexual pheromone bird crap will become bigger and white up the Italian Prime Minister will grow a new body part but no one will know what it is a man will scoff and say look I've got nothing against these prophecies look I've got nothing against these prophecies anyone is free to prophesy anything they like but don't piss on the roof and tell me it's raining if the end of days is supposed to see an increase in war pestilence and famine then we've seen the opposite happening in the last 2,000 years we've never been healthier better fed and more at peace if you can't accept that then here's a challenge read a history book then find any decade in the past 2,000 years when war famine and disease were less prevalent than the last 10 years find a time when we were more at peace find a time when average life expectancy was higher when disease was lower or when the world was better fed we may have conflicts in Afghanistan and Burma and elsewhere but we have nothing to compare to the 8th century and Lou rebellion that killed around 15% of the world's population and while we have the threat from Al-Qaeda for two centuries Western Europe was terrorized by the Vikings and a few centuries later most of Europe and Asia lived in fear of Mongol invasions you think AIDS is a sign of increased pestilence what about the Black Death bubonic plague that wiped out a third of the population of Europe in the Middle Ages or the depopulation of the Americas from introduced diseases what about cholera measles polio typhoid and smallpox that were once prevalent but have now either disappeared or been brought under control now the average life expectancy of the world's population is the highest it's ever been ironically in this age of science and reason it's easier than ever to set yourself up as a sagacious prophet all you need is to have a basic knowledge of seismic geology and an audience that doesn't choose an active tectonic plate boundary and prophesy a major earthquake and I recommend going for the region of the world that's more seismically active than any other the Western rim of the Pacific I guarantee you'll be able to hail yourself as a prophet the next time the crustal plates move but don't just take my word for it listen to this little fakir the rumors of things going astray and there shall be a great confusion as to where things really are and nobody will really know where lieth those little things",
