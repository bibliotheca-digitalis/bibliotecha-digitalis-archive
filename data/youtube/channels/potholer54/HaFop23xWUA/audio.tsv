0	3840	I saw these angels taking up positions everywhere in the day what to the real
3840	10840	I didn't really know you nearly holding on Sunday huge mighty angel over the
10840	16160	Pacific Ocean Pacific Samara Samara Kim a the South China Sea region there could
16160	20240	see in a couple of you let me accurately tell you where exactly in geographical
20240	25160	position he station who all are really young they adapt in the day what to the
25160	32280	if you guess that these angels have something to do with the end of the
32280	37360	world of course you'd be right YouTube profits have been working overtime to
37360	40880	explain that an increasing number of earthquakes taking place around the
40880	46080	world is a harbinger of end times now it's easy to ridicule these people and
46080	49600	make fun of their sincerely-held beliefs so here we go
76080	80720	preparing for this whether you believe it or not you know the Bible warns us
80720	84400	of course of the increasing number of earthquakes right as the return of the
84400	87880	Lord draws near as the day of the Lord draws near right that you're going to
87880	91520	see increasing number of earthquakes now we've already seen the quake and then
91520	95720	we've had a second quake now right with a different epicenter in Japan okay
95720	100560	that's two so the obvious question to ask is are we really seeing an
100560	105720	increasing number of earthquakes not one single creationist televangelist or
105720	110360	self-proclaimed profit bother to even ask this question or check to see if
110360	115840	their premise is correct so I suppose I'll have to do it for them the United
115840	119760	States Geological Survey keeps tabs on the number of earthquakes worldwide and
119760	124240	no surprise it turns out that earthquakes of magnitude 7 or greater
124240	128240	have remained fairly constant the perception that there are more
128240	132080	earthquakes may be the result of more numerous and accurate seismometers as
132280	137240	the USGS suggests but it may also be because the worldwide reach of satellites
137240	141520	and television news means creationists are more aware of what's going on in the
141520	145800	world beyond the moonshine still and the hay barn it would help if their
145800	149720	understanding of the past equally extended beyond the most recent hoedown
149720	154480	while instruments weren't around to record the Shenzi earthquake in China it
154480	158800	killed eight hundred and thirty thousand people on that scale this should have
158800	162840	been the mother of all harbingers of the end of times except that the world
162840	169160	didn't end the earthquake happened in 1556 230,000 people were killed in an
169160	174640	earthquake near Aleppo Syria and the world didn't end then either in 1138
174640	181800	around 200,000 died in an earthquake in Iran in 856 a hundred thousand in China
181800	188200	in 1290 none of this seems to have ended the world and the activity has not got
188200	193120	any worse earthquakes are caused by the movement of tectonic plates when two
193120	197880	plates get jammed stress accumulates and when the jam is broken the plates move
197880	202840	suddenly and cause an earthquake that isn't to say there isn't some pattern to
202840	206960	all this earthquake activity because movement along one section of a plate
206960	210920	boundary will put stress on the plate borders either side of it a phenomenon
210920	215160	known as stress transfer a very clear example of this pattern was found by
215160	219360	researchers Stein Barker and Dietrich along the North Anatolian fault line in
219360	223640	Turkey an earthquake at the eastern end of the fault line transfers stress
223640	228320	further west triggering another earthquake years later over years and
228320	232720	decades these earthquakes March inevitably westwards there may even be
232720	236460	an external cause that triggers seemingly unconnected earthquakes in
236460	240080	different parts of the world because although the cause of large earthquakes
240080	244200	is crustal movement many faults around the world are under great stress and
244240	249040	close to rupturing so it doesn't take much to trigger them telesysmic waves
249040	253280	for example which travel through several plates and even global weather patterns
253280	257200	research shows that a sudden drop in atmospheric pressure can trigger
257200	261320	earthquakes but it still doesn't mean Danny Glover was right when he said the
261320	265880	Haiti earthquake was caused by global warming there's also the tidal effect of
265880	269440	the moon's gravitational attraction which moves the Earth's crust as well as
269440	273280	the oceans there are still a lot of unknowns that may cause earthquakes to
273280	277440	cluster in different parts of the world over a period of years but according to
277440	282280	the USGS there's still no unusual pattern of earthquakes occurring so far
282280	286560	this century compared to the long term we just have to give thanks to God that
286560	291600	there's no one did I mean there's lots of damage to property
291600	296160	everybody agrees normally when you when you hear of earthquakes you look at
296160	300640	people going through rubble looking for dead living persons and dead persons and
301360	304680	this has to be one of the wonders of the world
304680	308840	that of course was after the so-called miracle earthquake that hit Christchurch
308840	313800	last year a few months later another earthquake hit the city and nearly 200
313800	318080	people were killed for some reason Bishop Jones didn't go on television
318080	322360	again to talk about the wonders of the Lord or his pious interpretation of
322360	327160	seismic geology Glenn Beck on the other hand well here's what he thought
327200	331320	President Obama should say when the Japanese earthquake struck in March
331320	337960	my fellow Americans I know that you like me are heartbroken over what the people
337960	344840	in Japan are enduring right now it was a massive earthquake 9.0 you know it you
344840	349920	can't avoid it you've seen it everywhere it's one of the largest earthquakes on
349920	354240	our planet's history of course it's not our planet has been through much bigger
354320	358560	earthquakes but no one can fault the sentiment anyway that's what Beck said
358560	362560	when pretending to be the president here's what Beck said about the Japanese
362560	367480	earthquake when he was playing himself I'm not saying God is you know causing
367480	374640	earthquakes well I'm not saying that I'm not not saying that either God what God
374640	379800	does is God's business I have no idea but I'll tell you this whether you call
379800	387320	it Gaia or whether you call it Jesus there's a message being sent and that is
387320	392840	hey you know that stuff we're doing not really working out real well maybe we
392840	399280	should stop doing some of it I'm just saying well Glenn if earthquakes are a
399280	403680	punishment to mankind for our sin then why are the only people being punished
403680	408040	those who live near seismically active fault lines does human wickedness only
408200	412840	happen along the edges of crustal plates if earthquakes are a sign of anything
412840	417240	they're a sign that crustal plates are continuing to move just as they have for
417240	420720	millions of years and the Earth's geology is pretty much the same as it's
420720	425480	been since the Cambrian if anything was going to herald some supernatural end of
425480	429440	the world it would surely be if the Earth's crustal plates stopped moving
429440	433800	and we got no earthquakes but earthquakes aren't the only sign of
433800	438020	impending doom apparently all sorts of nasty things are now going on in the
438020	442820	world we have these natural disasters we have people murdering each other we
442820	446980	wow that's a hurdle the parents killing their children you can't even keep up
446980	452340	with what's going on anymore we have this economic problems all over the
452340	457460	world yep this never happened before these things are going to get worse
457460	465620	spill it again worse and again worse okay okay that's enough
465940	473660	signs of judgment day the end times the Sean Connery impersonator is right just
473660	478420	listen in the near future ignoramus is amongst profuse knowledge unjust wars
478420	483220	and earthquakes will increase wealth promiscuity and unheard of diseases will
483220	488500	spread and good manners and family ties will cease a slave girl will give birth
488500	492740	to her future master the moon will appear bigger women will outnumber men
492820	498900	50 to 1 and wild animals will speak foot odor will become a sexual pheromone bird
498900	503300	crap will become bigger and white up the Italian Prime Minister will grow a new
503300	508420	body part but no one will know what it is a man will scoff and say look I've
508420	512660	got nothing against these prophecies look I've got nothing against these
512660	517460	prophecies anyone is free to prophesy anything they like but don't piss on the
517460	521620	roof and tell me it's raining if the end of days is supposed to see an increase
521620	526300	in war pestilence and famine then we've seen the opposite happening in the last
526300	531380	2,000 years we've never been healthier better fed and more at peace if you
531380	535820	can't accept that then here's a challenge read a history book then find
535820	540460	any decade in the past 2,000 years when war famine and disease were less
540460	545380	prevalent than the last 10 years find a time when we were more at peace find a
545380	549940	time when average life expectancy was higher when disease was lower or when
549940	554900	the world was better fed we may have conflicts in Afghanistan and Burma and
554900	559180	elsewhere but we have nothing to compare to the 8th century and Lou rebellion
559180	563980	that killed around 15% of the world's population and while we have the threat
563980	569020	from Al-Qaeda for two centuries Western Europe was terrorized by the Vikings and
569020	573620	a few centuries later most of Europe and Asia lived in fear of Mongol invasions
573620	578020	you think AIDS is a sign of increased pestilence what about the Black Death
578020	581660	bubonic plague that wiped out a third of the population of Europe in the
581660	586060	Middle Ages or the depopulation of the Americas from introduced diseases what
586060	591020	about cholera measles polio typhoid and smallpox that were once prevalent but
591020	595780	have now either disappeared or been brought under control now the average
595780	599660	life expectancy of the world's population is the highest it's ever been
599660	604460	ironically in this age of science and reason it's easier than ever to set
604460	608980	yourself up as a sagacious prophet all you need is to have a basic knowledge of
608980	613980	seismic geology and an audience that doesn't choose an active tectonic plate
613980	618580	boundary and prophesy a major earthquake and I recommend going for the region of
618580	622460	the world that's more seismically active than any other the Western rim of the
622460	626940	Pacific I guarantee you'll be able to hail yourself as a prophet the next time
626940	631380	the crustal plates move but don't just take my word for it listen to this
631380	634100	little fakir
661380	667340	the rumors of things going astray and there shall be a great confusion as to
667340	672980	where things really are and nobody will really know where lieth those little
672980	675220	things
