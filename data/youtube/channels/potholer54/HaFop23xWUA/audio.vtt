00:00.000 --> 00:03.840
I saw these angels taking up positions everywhere in the day what to the real

00:03.840 --> 00:10.840
I didn't really know you nearly holding on Sunday huge mighty angel over the

00:10.840 --> 00:16.160
Pacific Ocean Pacific Samara Samara Kim a the South China Sea region there could

00:16.160 --> 00:20.240
see in a couple of you let me accurately tell you where exactly in geographical

00:20.240 --> 00:25.160
position he station who all are really young they adapt in the day what to the

00:25.160 --> 00:32.280
if you guess that these angels have something to do with the end of the

00:32.280 --> 00:37.360
world of course you'd be right YouTube profits have been working overtime to

00:37.360 --> 00:40.880
explain that an increasing number of earthquakes taking place around the

00:40.880 --> 00:46.080
world is a harbinger of end times now it's easy to ridicule these people and

00:46.080 --> 00:49.600
make fun of their sincerely-held beliefs so here we go

01:16.080 --> 01:20.720
preparing for this whether you believe it or not you know the Bible warns us

01:20.720 --> 01:24.400
of course of the increasing number of earthquakes right as the return of the

01:24.400 --> 01:27.880
Lord draws near as the day of the Lord draws near right that you're going to

01:27.880 --> 01:31.520
see increasing number of earthquakes now we've already seen the quake and then

01:31.520 --> 01:35.720
we've had a second quake now right with a different epicenter in Japan okay

01:35.720 --> 01:40.560
that's two so the obvious question to ask is are we really seeing an

01:40.560 --> 01:45.720
increasing number of earthquakes not one single creationist televangelist or

01:45.720 --> 01:50.360
self-proclaimed profit bother to even ask this question or check to see if

01:50.360 --> 01:55.840
their premise is correct so I suppose I'll have to do it for them the United

01:55.840 --> 01:59.760
States Geological Survey keeps tabs on the number of earthquakes worldwide and

01:59.760 --> 02:04.240
no surprise it turns out that earthquakes of magnitude 7 or greater

02:04.240 --> 02:08.240
have remained fairly constant the perception that there are more

02:08.240 --> 02:12.080
earthquakes may be the result of more numerous and accurate seismometers as

02:12.280 --> 02:17.240
the USGS suggests but it may also be because the worldwide reach of satellites

02:17.240 --> 02:21.520
and television news means creationists are more aware of what's going on in the

02:21.520 --> 02:25.800
world beyond the moonshine still and the hay barn it would help if their

02:25.800 --> 02:29.720
understanding of the past equally extended beyond the most recent hoedown

02:29.720 --> 02:34.480
while instruments weren't around to record the Shenzi earthquake in China it

02:34.480 --> 02:38.800
killed eight hundred and thirty thousand people on that scale this should have

02:38.800 --> 02:42.840
been the mother of all harbingers of the end of times except that the world

02:42.840 --> 02:49.160
didn't end the earthquake happened in 1556 230,000 people were killed in an

02:49.160 --> 02:54.640
earthquake near Aleppo Syria and the world didn't end then either in 1138

02:54.640 --> 03:01.800
around 200,000 died in an earthquake in Iran in 856 a hundred thousand in China

03:01.800 --> 03:08.200
in 1290 none of this seems to have ended the world and the activity has not got

03:08.200 --> 03:13.120
any worse earthquakes are caused by the movement of tectonic plates when two

03:13.120 --> 03:17.880
plates get jammed stress accumulates and when the jam is broken the plates move

03:17.880 --> 03:22.840
suddenly and cause an earthquake that isn't to say there isn't some pattern to

03:22.840 --> 03:26.960
all this earthquake activity because movement along one section of a plate

03:26.960 --> 03:30.920
boundary will put stress on the plate borders either side of it a phenomenon

03:30.920 --> 03:35.160
known as stress transfer a very clear example of this pattern was found by

03:35.160 --> 03:39.360
researchers Stein Barker and Dietrich along the North Anatolian fault line in

03:39.360 --> 03:43.640
Turkey an earthquake at the eastern end of the fault line transfers stress

03:43.640 --> 03:48.320
further west triggering another earthquake years later over years and

03:48.320 --> 03:52.720
decades these earthquakes March inevitably westwards there may even be

03:52.720 --> 03:56.460
an external cause that triggers seemingly unconnected earthquakes in

03:56.460 --> 04:00.080
different parts of the world because although the cause of large earthquakes

04:00.080 --> 04:04.200
is crustal movement many faults around the world are under great stress and

04:04.240 --> 04:09.040
close to rupturing so it doesn't take much to trigger them telesysmic waves

04:09.040 --> 04:13.280
for example which travel through several plates and even global weather patterns

04:13.280 --> 04:17.200
research shows that a sudden drop in atmospheric pressure can trigger

04:17.200 --> 04:21.320
earthquakes but it still doesn't mean Danny Glover was right when he said the

04:21.320 --> 04:25.880
Haiti earthquake was caused by global warming there's also the tidal effect of

04:25.880 --> 04:29.440
the moon's gravitational attraction which moves the Earth's crust as well as

04:29.440 --> 04:33.280
the oceans there are still a lot of unknowns that may cause earthquakes to

04:33.280 --> 04:37.440
cluster in different parts of the world over a period of years but according to

04:37.440 --> 04:42.280
the USGS there's still no unusual pattern of earthquakes occurring so far

04:42.280 --> 04:46.560
this century compared to the long term we just have to give thanks to God that

04:46.560 --> 04:51.600
there's no one did I mean there's lots of damage to property

04:51.600 --> 04:56.160
everybody agrees normally when you when you hear of earthquakes you look at

04:56.160 --> 05:00.640
people going through rubble looking for dead living persons and dead persons and

05:01.360 --> 05:04.680
this has to be one of the wonders of the world

05:04.680 --> 05:08.840
that of course was after the so-called miracle earthquake that hit Christchurch

05:08.840 --> 05:13.800
last year a few months later another earthquake hit the city and nearly 200

05:13.800 --> 05:18.080
people were killed for some reason Bishop Jones didn't go on television

05:18.080 --> 05:22.360
again to talk about the wonders of the Lord or his pious interpretation of

05:22.360 --> 05:27.160
seismic geology Glenn Beck on the other hand well here's what he thought

05:27.200 --> 05:31.320
President Obama should say when the Japanese earthquake struck in March

05:31.320 --> 05:37.960
my fellow Americans I know that you like me are heartbroken over what the people

05:37.960 --> 05:44.840
in Japan are enduring right now it was a massive earthquake 9.0 you know it you

05:44.840 --> 05:49.920
can't avoid it you've seen it everywhere it's one of the largest earthquakes on

05:49.920 --> 05:54.240
our planet's history of course it's not our planet has been through much bigger

05:54.320 --> 05:58.560
earthquakes but no one can fault the sentiment anyway that's what Beck said

05:58.560 --> 06:02.560
when pretending to be the president here's what Beck said about the Japanese

06:02.560 --> 06:07.480
earthquake when he was playing himself I'm not saying God is you know causing

06:07.480 --> 06:14.640
earthquakes well I'm not saying that I'm not not saying that either God what God

06:14.640 --> 06:19.800
does is God's business I have no idea but I'll tell you this whether you call

06:19.800 --> 06:27.320
it Gaia or whether you call it Jesus there's a message being sent and that is

06:27.320 --> 06:32.840
hey you know that stuff we're doing not really working out real well maybe we

06:32.840 --> 06:39.280
should stop doing some of it I'm just saying well Glenn if earthquakes are a

06:39.280 --> 06:43.680
punishment to mankind for our sin then why are the only people being punished

06:43.680 --> 06:48.040
those who live near seismically active fault lines does human wickedness only

06:48.200 --> 06:52.840
happen along the edges of crustal plates if earthquakes are a sign of anything

06:52.840 --> 06:57.240
they're a sign that crustal plates are continuing to move just as they have for

06:57.240 --> 07:00.720
millions of years and the Earth's geology is pretty much the same as it's

07:00.720 --> 07:05.480
been since the Cambrian if anything was going to herald some supernatural end of

07:05.480 --> 07:09.440
the world it would surely be if the Earth's crustal plates stopped moving

07:09.440 --> 07:13.800
and we got no earthquakes but earthquakes aren't the only sign of

07:13.800 --> 07:18.020
impending doom apparently all sorts of nasty things are now going on in the

07:18.020 --> 07:22.820
world we have these natural disasters we have people murdering each other we

07:22.820 --> 07:26.980
wow that's a hurdle the parents killing their children you can't even keep up

07:26.980 --> 07:32.340
with what's going on anymore we have this economic problems all over the

07:32.340 --> 07:37.460
world yep this never happened before these things are going to get worse

07:37.460 --> 07:45.620
spill it again worse and again worse okay okay that's enough

07:45.940 --> 07:53.660
signs of judgment day the end times the Sean Connery impersonator is right just

07:53.660 --> 07:58.420
listen in the near future ignoramus is amongst profuse knowledge unjust wars

07:58.420 --> 08:03.220
and earthquakes will increase wealth promiscuity and unheard of diseases will

08:03.220 --> 08:08.500
spread and good manners and family ties will cease a slave girl will give birth

08:08.500 --> 08:12.740
to her future master the moon will appear bigger women will outnumber men

08:12.820 --> 08:18.900
50 to 1 and wild animals will speak foot odor will become a sexual pheromone bird

08:18.900 --> 08:23.300
crap will become bigger and white up the Italian Prime Minister will grow a new

08:23.300 --> 08:28.420
body part but no one will know what it is a man will scoff and say look I've

08:28.420 --> 08:32.660
got nothing against these prophecies look I've got nothing against these

08:32.660 --> 08:37.460
prophecies anyone is free to prophesy anything they like but don't piss on the

08:37.460 --> 08:41.620
roof and tell me it's raining if the end of days is supposed to see an increase

08:41.620 --> 08:46.300
in war pestilence and famine then we've seen the opposite happening in the last

08:46.300 --> 08:51.380
2,000 years we've never been healthier better fed and more at peace if you

08:51.380 --> 08:55.820
can't accept that then here's a challenge read a history book then find

08:55.820 --> 09:00.460
any decade in the past 2,000 years when war famine and disease were less

09:00.460 --> 09:05.380
prevalent than the last 10 years find a time when we were more at peace find a

09:05.380 --> 09:09.940
time when average life expectancy was higher when disease was lower or when

09:09.940 --> 09:14.900
the world was better fed we may have conflicts in Afghanistan and Burma and

09:14.900 --> 09:19.180
elsewhere but we have nothing to compare to the 8th century and Lou rebellion

09:19.180 --> 09:23.980
that killed around 15% of the world's population and while we have the threat

09:23.980 --> 09:29.020
from Al-Qaeda for two centuries Western Europe was terrorized by the Vikings and

09:29.020 --> 09:33.620
a few centuries later most of Europe and Asia lived in fear of Mongol invasions

09:33.620 --> 09:38.020
you think AIDS is a sign of increased pestilence what about the Black Death

09:38.020 --> 09:41.660
bubonic plague that wiped out a third of the population of Europe in the

09:41.660 --> 09:46.060
Middle Ages or the depopulation of the Americas from introduced diseases what

09:46.060 --> 09:51.020
about cholera measles polio typhoid and smallpox that were once prevalent but

09:51.020 --> 09:55.780
have now either disappeared or been brought under control now the average

09:55.780 --> 09:59.660
life expectancy of the world's population is the highest it's ever been

09:59.660 --> 10:04.460
ironically in this age of science and reason it's easier than ever to set

10:04.460 --> 10:08.980
yourself up as a sagacious prophet all you need is to have a basic knowledge of

10:08.980 --> 10:13.980
seismic geology and an audience that doesn't choose an active tectonic plate

10:13.980 --> 10:18.580
boundary and prophesy a major earthquake and I recommend going for the region of

10:18.580 --> 10:22.460
the world that's more seismically active than any other the Western rim of the

10:22.460 --> 10:26.940
Pacific I guarantee you'll be able to hail yourself as a prophet the next time

10:26.940 --> 10:31.380
the crustal plates move but don't just take my word for it listen to this

10:31.380 --> 10:34.100
little fakir

11:01.380 --> 11:07.340
the rumors of things going astray and there shall be a great confusion as to

11:07.340 --> 11:12.980
where things really are and nobody will really know where lieth those little

11:12.980 --> 11:15.220
things
