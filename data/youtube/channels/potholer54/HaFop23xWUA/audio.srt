1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,840
I saw these angels taking up positions everywhere in the day what to the real

2
00:00:03,840 --> 00:00:10,840
I didn't really know you nearly holding on Sunday huge mighty angel over the

3
00:00:10,840 --> 00:00:16,160
Pacific Ocean Pacific Samara Samara Kim a the South China Sea region there could

4
00:00:16,160 --> 00:00:20,240
see in a couple of you let me accurately tell you where exactly in geographical

5
00:00:20,240 --> 00:00:25,160
position he station who all are really young they adapt in the day what to the

6
00:00:25,160 --> 00:00:32,280
if you guess that these angels have something to do with the end of the

7
00:00:32,280 --> 00:00:37,360
world of course you'd be right YouTube profits have been working overtime to

8
00:00:37,360 --> 00:00:40,880
explain that an increasing number of earthquakes taking place around the

9
00:00:40,880 --> 00:00:46,080
world is a harbinger of end times now it's easy to ridicule these people and

10
00:00:46,080 --> 00:00:49,600
make fun of their sincerely-held beliefs so here we go

11
00:01:16,080 --> 00:01:20,720
preparing for this whether you believe it or not you know the Bible warns us

12
00:01:20,720 --> 00:01:24,400
of course of the increasing number of earthquakes right as the return of the

13
00:01:24,400 --> 00:01:27,880
Lord draws near as the day of the Lord draws near right that you're going to

14
00:01:27,880 --> 00:01:31,520
see increasing number of earthquakes now we've already seen the quake and then

15
00:01:31,520 --> 00:01:35,720
we've had a second quake now right with a different epicenter in Japan okay

16
00:01:35,720 --> 00:01:40,560
that's two so the obvious question to ask is are we really seeing an

17
00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:45,720
increasing number of earthquakes not one single creationist televangelist or

18
00:01:45,720 --> 00:01:50,360
self-proclaimed profit bother to even ask this question or check to see if

19
00:01:50,360 --> 00:01:55,840
their premise is correct so I suppose I'll have to do it for them the United

20
00:01:55,840 --> 00:01:59,760
States Geological Survey keeps tabs on the number of earthquakes worldwide and

21
00:01:59,760 --> 00:02:04,240
no surprise it turns out that earthquakes of magnitude 7 or greater

22
00:02:04,240 --> 00:02:08,240
have remained fairly constant the perception that there are more

23
00:02:08,240 --> 00:02:12,080
earthquakes may be the result of more numerous and accurate seismometers as

24
00:02:12,280 --> 00:02:17,240
the USGS suggests but it may also be because the worldwide reach of satellites

25
00:02:17,240 --> 00:02:21,520
and television news means creationists are more aware of what's going on in the

26
00:02:21,520 --> 00:02:25,800
world beyond the moonshine still and the hay barn it would help if their

27
00:02:25,800 --> 00:02:29,720
understanding of the past equally extended beyond the most recent hoedown

28
00:02:29,720 --> 00:02:34,480
while instruments weren't around to record the Shenzi earthquake in China it

29
00:02:34,480 --> 00:02:38,800
killed eight hundred and thirty thousand people on that scale this should have

30
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:42,840
been the mother of all harbingers of the end of times except that the world

31
00:02:42,840 --> 00:02:49,160
didn't end the earthquake happened in 1556 230,000 people were killed in an

32
00:02:49,160 --> 00:02:54,640
earthquake near Aleppo Syria and the world didn't end then either in 1138

33
00:02:54,640 --> 00:03:01,800
around 200,000 died in an earthquake in Iran in 856 a hundred thousand in China

34
00:03:01,800 --> 00:03:08,200
in 1290 none of this seems to have ended the world and the activity has not got

35
00:03:08,200 --> 00:03:13,120
any worse earthquakes are caused by the movement of tectonic plates when two

36
00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:17,880
plates get jammed stress accumulates and when the jam is broken the plates move

37
00:03:17,880 --> 00:03:22,840
suddenly and cause an earthquake that isn't to say there isn't some pattern to

38
00:03:22,840 --> 00:03:26,960
all this earthquake activity because movement along one section of a plate

39
00:03:26,960 --> 00:03:30,920
boundary will put stress on the plate borders either side of it a phenomenon

40
00:03:30,920 --> 00:03:35,160
known as stress transfer a very clear example of this pattern was found by

41
00:03:35,160 --> 00:03:39,360
researchers Stein Barker and Dietrich along the North Anatolian fault line in

42
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:43,640
Turkey an earthquake at the eastern end of the fault line transfers stress

43
00:03:43,640 --> 00:03:48,320
further west triggering another earthquake years later over years and

44
00:03:48,320 --> 00:03:52,720
decades these earthquakes March inevitably westwards there may even be

45
00:03:52,720 --> 00:03:56,460
an external cause that triggers seemingly unconnected earthquakes in

46
00:03:56,460 --> 00:04:00,080
different parts of the world because although the cause of large earthquakes

47
00:04:00,080 --> 00:04:04,200
is crustal movement many faults around the world are under great stress and

48
00:04:04,240 --> 00:04:09,040
close to rupturing so it doesn't take much to trigger them telesysmic waves

49
00:04:09,040 --> 00:04:13,280
for example which travel through several plates and even global weather patterns

50
00:04:13,280 --> 00:04:17,200
research shows that a sudden drop in atmospheric pressure can trigger

51
00:04:17,200 --> 00:04:21,320
earthquakes but it still doesn't mean Danny Glover was right when he said the

52
00:04:21,320 --> 00:04:25,880
Haiti earthquake was caused by global warming there's also the tidal effect of

53
00:04:25,880 --> 00:04:29,440
the moon's gravitational attraction which moves the Earth's crust as well as

54
00:04:29,440 --> 00:04:33,280
the oceans there are still a lot of unknowns that may cause earthquakes to

55
00:04:33,280 --> 00:04:37,440
cluster in different parts of the world over a period of years but according to

56
00:04:37,440 --> 00:04:42,280
the USGS there's still no unusual pattern of earthquakes occurring so far

57
00:04:42,280 --> 00:04:46,560
this century compared to the long term we just have to give thanks to God that

58
00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:51,600
there's no one did I mean there's lots of damage to property

59
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:56,160
everybody agrees normally when you when you hear of earthquakes you look at

60
00:04:56,160 --> 00:05:00,640
people going through rubble looking for dead living persons and dead persons and

61
00:05:01,360 --> 00:05:04,680
this has to be one of the wonders of the world

62
00:05:04,680 --> 00:05:08,840
that of course was after the so-called miracle earthquake that hit Christchurch

63
00:05:08,840 --> 00:05:13,800
last year a few months later another earthquake hit the city and nearly 200

64
00:05:13,800 --> 00:05:18,080
people were killed for some reason Bishop Jones didn't go on television

65
00:05:18,080 --> 00:05:22,360
again to talk about the wonders of the Lord or his pious interpretation of

66
00:05:22,360 --> 00:05:27,160
seismic geology Glenn Beck on the other hand well here's what he thought

67
00:05:27,200 --> 00:05:31,320
President Obama should say when the Japanese earthquake struck in March

68
00:05:31,320 --> 00:05:37,960
my fellow Americans I know that you like me are heartbroken over what the people

69
00:05:37,960 --> 00:05:44,840
in Japan are enduring right now it was a massive earthquake 9.0 you know it you

70
00:05:44,840 --> 00:05:49,920
can't avoid it you've seen it everywhere it's one of the largest earthquakes on

71
00:05:49,920 --> 00:05:54,240
our planet's history of course it's not our planet has been through much bigger

72
00:05:54,320 --> 00:05:58,560
earthquakes but no one can fault the sentiment anyway that's what Beck said

73
00:05:58,560 --> 00:06:02,560
when pretending to be the president here's what Beck said about the Japanese

74
00:06:02,560 --> 00:06:07,480
earthquake when he was playing himself I'm not saying God is you know causing

75
00:06:07,480 --> 00:06:14,640
earthquakes well I'm not saying that I'm not not saying that either God what God

76
00:06:14,640 --> 00:06:19,800
does is God's business I have no idea but I'll tell you this whether you call

77
00:06:19,800 --> 00:06:27,320
it Gaia or whether you call it Jesus there's a message being sent and that is

78
00:06:27,320 --> 00:06:32,840
hey you know that stuff we're doing not really working out real well maybe we

79
00:06:32,840 --> 00:06:39,280
should stop doing some of it I'm just saying well Glenn if earthquakes are a

80
00:06:39,280 --> 00:06:43,680
punishment to mankind for our sin then why are the only people being punished

81
00:06:43,680 --> 00:06:48,040
those who live near seismically active fault lines does human wickedness only

82
00:06:48,200 --> 00:06:52,840
happen along the edges of crustal plates if earthquakes are a sign of anything

83
00:06:52,840 --> 00:06:57,240
they're a sign that crustal plates are continuing to move just as they have for

84
00:06:57,240 --> 00:07:00,720
millions of years and the Earth's geology is pretty much the same as it's

85
00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:05,480
been since the Cambrian if anything was going to herald some supernatural end of

86
00:07:05,480 --> 00:07:09,440
the world it would surely be if the Earth's crustal plates stopped moving

87
00:07:09,440 --> 00:07:13,800
and we got no earthquakes but earthquakes aren't the only sign of

88
00:07:13,800 --> 00:07:18,020
impending doom apparently all sorts of nasty things are now going on in the

89
00:07:18,020 --> 00:07:22,820
world we have these natural disasters we have people murdering each other we

90
00:07:22,820 --> 00:07:26,980
wow that's a hurdle the parents killing their children you can't even keep up

91
00:07:26,980 --> 00:07:32,340
with what's going on anymore we have this economic problems all over the

92
00:07:32,340 --> 00:07:37,460
world yep this never happened before these things are going to get worse

93
00:07:37,460 --> 00:07:45,620
spill it again worse and again worse okay okay that's enough

94
00:07:45,940 --> 00:07:53,660
signs of judgment day the end times the Sean Connery impersonator is right just

95
00:07:53,660 --> 00:07:58,420
listen in the near future ignoramus is amongst profuse knowledge unjust wars

96
00:07:58,420 --> 00:08:03,220
and earthquakes will increase wealth promiscuity and unheard of diseases will

97
00:08:03,220 --> 00:08:08,500
spread and good manners and family ties will cease a slave girl will give birth

98
00:08:08,500 --> 00:08:12,740
to her future master the moon will appear bigger women will outnumber men

99
00:08:12,820 --> 00:08:18,900
50 to 1 and wild animals will speak foot odor will become a sexual pheromone bird

100
00:08:18,900 --> 00:08:23,300
crap will become bigger and white up the Italian Prime Minister will grow a new

101
00:08:23,300 --> 00:08:28,420
body part but no one will know what it is a man will scoff and say look I've

102
00:08:28,420 --> 00:08:32,660
got nothing against these prophecies look I've got nothing against these

103
00:08:32,660 --> 00:08:37,460
prophecies anyone is free to prophesy anything they like but don't piss on the

104
00:08:37,460 --> 00:08:41,620
roof and tell me it's raining if the end of days is supposed to see an increase

105
00:08:41,620 --> 00:08:46,300
in war pestilence and famine then we've seen the opposite happening in the last

106
00:08:46,300 --> 00:08:51,380
2,000 years we've never been healthier better fed and more at peace if you

107
00:08:51,380 --> 00:08:55,820
can't accept that then here's a challenge read a history book then find

108
00:08:55,820 --> 00:09:00,460
any decade in the past 2,000 years when war famine and disease were less

109
00:09:00,460 --> 00:09:05,380
prevalent than the last 10 years find a time when we were more at peace find a

110
00:09:05,380 --> 00:09:09,940
time when average life expectancy was higher when disease was lower or when

111
00:09:09,940 --> 00:09:14,900
the world was better fed we may have conflicts in Afghanistan and Burma and

112
00:09:14,900 --> 00:09:19,180
elsewhere but we have nothing to compare to the 8th century and Lou rebellion

113
00:09:19,180 --> 00:09:23,980
that killed around 15% of the world's population and while we have the threat

114
00:09:23,980 --> 00:09:29,020
from Al-Qaeda for two centuries Western Europe was terrorized by the Vikings and

115
00:09:29,020 --> 00:09:33,620
a few centuries later most of Europe and Asia lived in fear of Mongol invasions

116
00:09:33,620 --> 00:09:38,020
you think AIDS is a sign of increased pestilence what about the Black Death

117
00:09:38,020 --> 00:09:41,660
bubonic plague that wiped out a third of the population of Europe in the

118
00:09:41,660 --> 00:09:46,060
Middle Ages or the depopulation of the Americas from introduced diseases what

119
00:09:46,060 --> 00:09:51,020
about cholera measles polio typhoid and smallpox that were once prevalent but

120
00:09:51,020 --> 00:09:55,780
have now either disappeared or been brought under control now the average

121
00:09:55,780 --> 00:09:59,660
life expectancy of the world's population is the highest it's ever been

122
00:09:59,660 --> 00:10:04,460
ironically in this age of science and reason it's easier than ever to set

123
00:10:04,460 --> 00:10:08,980
yourself up as a sagacious prophet all you need is to have a basic knowledge of

124
00:10:08,980 --> 00:10:13,980
seismic geology and an audience that doesn't choose an active tectonic plate

125
00:10:13,980 --> 00:10:18,580
boundary and prophesy a major earthquake and I recommend going for the region of

126
00:10:18,580 --> 00:10:22,460
the world that's more seismically active than any other the Western rim of the

127
00:10:22,460 --> 00:10:26,940
Pacific I guarantee you'll be able to hail yourself as a prophet the next time

128
00:10:26,940 --> 00:10:31,380
the crustal plates move but don't just take my word for it listen to this

129
00:10:31,380 --> 00:10:34,100
little fakir

130
00:11:01,380 --> 00:11:07,340
the rumors of things going astray and there shall be a great confusion as to

131
00:11:07,340 --> 00:11:12,980
where things really are and nobody will really know where lieth those little

132
00:11:12,980 --> 00:11:15,220
things
