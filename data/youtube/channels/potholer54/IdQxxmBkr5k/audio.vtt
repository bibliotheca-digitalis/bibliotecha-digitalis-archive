00:00.000 --> 00:05.340
I thought I'd spend a bit of time making corrections, responding to criticisms, and perhaps clarifying

00:05.340 --> 00:06.340
a few things.

00:06.340 --> 00:11.640
First of all, thanks for the messages, positive and negative, and I assure you that I do appreciate

00:11.640 --> 00:13.140
and read them.

00:13.140 --> 00:16.800
One of the most common questions I get asked is, why don't you make more videos?

00:16.800 --> 00:18.600
Well, the reason is simple.

00:18.600 --> 00:22.640
To make just one video, I first have to spend a lot of time listening to what's being claimed

00:22.640 --> 00:25.840
on the internet, in newspapers and TV reports.

00:25.840 --> 00:30.520
I have to ensure that any myth I debunk is something that's widespread and popularly

00:30.520 --> 00:31.520
believed.

00:31.520 --> 00:35.400
That way I can't be accused of creating a straw man argument.

00:35.400 --> 00:39.220
Then I spend even more time going through the scientific literature and reading papers

00:39.220 --> 00:41.760
that deal with that particular subject.

00:41.760 --> 00:45.640
If I didn't bother doing all this research, then of course I could churn out several videos

00:45.640 --> 00:50.680
a week, just by sitting in front of a video camera and spouting opinions and beliefs.

00:50.680 --> 00:55.040
The whole point of this channel is to get away from mindless opinion and belief, and

00:55.040 --> 00:58.840
to explain science as it's represented in the scientific literature.

00:58.840 --> 01:03.840
I thought Monitor 301 summed it up rather well in this comment from the forum of my

01:03.840 --> 01:05.640
video, Who Am I?

01:05.640 --> 01:09.180
No noteworthy scientific credentials to speak of.

01:09.180 --> 01:10.720
He's referring to me.

01:10.720 --> 01:13.360
And a similar point from Research Siempre.

01:13.360 --> 01:14.680
Who is potholder?

01:14.680 --> 01:17.360
And what scientific research has he conducted?

01:17.360 --> 01:20.400
Just reading IPCC talking points doesn't count.

01:20.400 --> 01:24.720
Well, I'm happy to tell you that I don't do any scientific research.

01:24.720 --> 01:29.000
All I can do is report what people who do have scientific credentials have discovered

01:29.000 --> 01:31.240
through their research.

01:31.240 --> 01:36.200
By the way, Research Siempre, I don't use the IPCC as a source, as you could quite easily

01:36.200 --> 01:42.200
ascertain by reading the list of my sources provided on the videos and in the video descriptions.

01:42.200 --> 01:46.240
In a similar vein, this kind of comment was also quite common.

01:46.240 --> 01:49.400
Pothola54 claims that CO2 drives warming.

01:49.400 --> 01:54.160
Actually, the claim is that CO2 is one of the factors that drives climate, but never

01:54.160 --> 01:55.160
mind.

01:55.160 --> 01:59.280
The point is, it's not my claim, because I'm not a climate researcher.

01:59.280 --> 02:03.640
What's presented in my videos are the discoveries and conclusions of people who are climate

02:03.640 --> 02:04.640
researchers.

02:04.640 --> 02:08.160
Now, of course, I may get things wrong in reporting the science.

02:08.160 --> 02:13.280
In my last series, Our Origins Made Easy, I issued two errata videos correcting mistakes

02:13.280 --> 02:17.540
that had been pointed out by viewers, and I'm also very grateful to those who've pointed

02:17.540 --> 02:22.200
out mistakes in the climate change series, so here they are.

02:22.200 --> 02:25.720
Several people noticed that this animation in the first video was wrong.

02:25.720 --> 02:30.000
It should be the electron shells that are excited, not the nucleus.

02:30.000 --> 02:34.740
Zebauer pointed out a mistake in language in my video Climate Change the Objections,

02:34.740 --> 02:35.740
in which I said this.

02:35.740 --> 02:41.360
A very good correlation between global temperatures and solar output over most of the last 250

02:41.360 --> 02:46.560
years, but not the very period that covers a dramatic rise in global temperatures.

02:46.560 --> 02:50.360
I agree the term dramatic is meaningless and hyperbolic.

02:50.360 --> 02:55.600
Scientifically speaking, the rise in temperatures should be described as statistically significant.

02:55.600 --> 03:00.240
In other words, it's due to something other than normal background fluctuations.

03:00.240 --> 03:04.580
There were two mistakes in my most recent video, hurricanes, atolls and coral.

03:04.580 --> 03:09.200
The calcium carbonate that makes up coral skeletons takes the mineral form aragonite,

03:09.200 --> 03:13.920
not calcite, and the chemical equation I showed in the paper related to lower saturation of

03:13.920 --> 03:18.520
carbonate ions in seawater, not the formation of carbonic acid.

03:18.520 --> 03:23.200
This is yet another problem for coral that I didn't have time to discuss, but both saturation

03:23.200 --> 03:26.320
and acidification are discussed in the same paper.

03:26.320 --> 03:29.320
I just put up the wrong image by mistake.

03:29.320 --> 03:33.080
Here's another error in my videos which looks rather serious.

03:33.080 --> 03:35.400
This guy potholer isn't worth the time to watch.

03:35.400 --> 03:39.480
I caught him in another video manipulating data the second after claiming the other side

03:39.480 --> 03:40.960
of the debate is manipulating.

03:40.960 --> 03:43.620
I've been manipulating data?

03:43.620 --> 03:48.940
Well then, I definitely have to correct this and apologise profusely to my subscribers.

03:48.940 --> 03:51.700
What did I manipulate, night version?

03:51.700 --> 03:56.180
In the video climate change supplement at around one minute, watch how he uses the images

03:56.180 --> 03:59.540
to jump past Jones's reply to question A and jumps to B.

03:59.540 --> 04:03.540
Oh, so I didn't manipulate any data at all.

04:03.540 --> 04:05.260
Apparently, I missed something.

04:05.260 --> 04:08.680
Okay, still, let's take a look and see what I missed.

04:08.680 --> 04:11.660
Here's the part of the video night version mentions.

04:11.660 --> 04:12.740
Night version goes on.

04:12.740 --> 04:15.300
I tried to read the text, but it is concealed.

04:15.300 --> 04:18.180
Well, no, it's not concealed at all.

04:18.180 --> 04:22.660
I was just giving you an establishing shot to show the webpage with the BBC logo at the

04:22.660 --> 04:28.020
top and then I dissolved to the answer that was the focus of the Daily Mail story.

04:28.020 --> 04:33.340
If you want to see the entire BBC webpage, I give a link to it in my video description,

04:33.340 --> 04:38.340
so if I did want to conceal this information, obviously I'm doing a piss poor job.

04:38.340 --> 04:41.820
He does this because he doesn't like Jones's answer to A.

04:41.820 --> 04:45.460
But science has nothing to do with liking or disliking answers.

04:45.460 --> 04:50.020
It's only concerned with whether answers are based on proper observation and are correct.

04:50.020 --> 04:54.780
No, the reason I focused on the answer to question B is because that was the focus of

04:54.780 --> 04:59.080
the Daily Mail headline that was copied all over the internet.

04:59.080 --> 05:01.740
So what is this mysterious answer A?

05:01.740 --> 05:08.820
Well, Jones looks at three periods of warming over the past 150 years, 1860 to 1880, 1910

05:08.820 --> 05:12.900
to 1940 and 1975 to 2009.

05:12.900 --> 05:18.140
And he told the BBC all three have statistically significant periods of warming.

05:18.140 --> 05:22.140
At first I didn't know why Knight version thought this was so extraordinary.

05:22.140 --> 05:26.620
You can find these and other examples of past warming in dozens of papers and they are clearly

05:26.620 --> 05:28.660
shown in reconstructions.

05:28.660 --> 05:32.820
But then I searched the political websites and it turns out that this is yet another

05:32.820 --> 05:37.780
argument that climate change is natural, the climate always changes and that there is nothing

05:37.780 --> 05:41.140
unusual about the current rise in temperatures.

05:41.140 --> 05:45.140
Anyone who's watched this series knows that of course that's true.

05:45.140 --> 05:49.700
Carbon dioxide is a natural gas that's been around for billions of years and many times

05:49.700 --> 05:54.420
in the past the Earth has warmed and cooled as levels of carbon dioxide have risen and

05:54.420 --> 05:55.460
fallen.

05:55.460 --> 05:58.000
But as I've also mentioned more than onceâ€¦

05:58.000 --> 06:02.700
The climate isn't driven by carbon dioxide alone because carbon dioxide isn't the only

06:02.700 --> 06:04.780
factor that affects global temperatures.

06:04.780 --> 06:08.860
I don't want to go through all this again, just watch the earlier videos.

06:08.860 --> 06:12.580
Climate is driven by a number of different factors known as forcings.

06:12.580 --> 06:18.420
The 1860 to 1880 rise in temperatures coincided with an increase in solar forcing.

06:18.420 --> 06:24.000
The 1910 to 1940 period also experienced solar forcing but climatologists have found other

06:24.000 --> 06:29.380
influencing factors such as higher levels of carbon dioxide and Atlantic Ocean circulation

06:29.380 --> 06:30.460
patterns.

06:30.500 --> 06:36.140
All these forcings have to be looked at together, not just carbon dioxide alone.

06:36.140 --> 06:40.700
While we're on the subject of the BBC Jones Q&A, Guffpot, who writes more words on my

06:40.700 --> 06:45.420
channel than I do, insisted that the Daily Mail got its headline right.

06:45.420 --> 06:50.260
So as always when someone points out a mistake, I ask where and when Jones had said there'd

06:50.260 --> 06:53.220
been no warming since 1995.

06:53.220 --> 06:57.940
Guffpot responded, are you really insisting those specific words must be spoken?

06:57.980 --> 07:03.180
No, but I do insist that if a newspaper is going to paraphrase, then it does have a duty

07:03.180 --> 07:07.120
not to completely change the meaning of what someone says.

07:07.120 --> 07:11.260
In case I made a mistake, let's look again at what Jones really did say.

07:11.260 --> 07:15.860
I also calculated the trend for the period 1995 to 2009.

07:15.860 --> 07:21.020
This trend at 0.12 degrees centigrade per decade is positive.

07:21.020 --> 07:25.380
To correctly paraphrase what Jones is saying, the temperature trend is up.

07:25.380 --> 07:30.740
He's saying the Earth has been warming by about 0.12 degrees centigrade per decade since

07:30.740 --> 07:32.140
1995.

07:32.140 --> 07:37.340
He goes on, but not significant at the 95% significance level.

07:37.340 --> 07:41.260
The positive trend is quite close to the significance level.

07:41.260 --> 07:45.820
In other words, there's maybe a 90% confidence level that it's more likely than not that

07:45.820 --> 07:52.220
the warming is caused by something other than background fluctuations, but we can't be 95%

07:52.220 --> 07:53.300
confident of that.

07:53.300 --> 07:57.380
We're confident we are about the cause of this warming, whether it's due to carbon dioxide,

07:57.380 --> 08:00.480
reflections from the Moon, or Al Gore letting off steam.

08:00.480 --> 08:06.180
The fact is, Jones said that the Earth has been warming since 1995.

08:06.180 --> 08:12.140
Could anyone really think the Daily Mail got that right when it claimed the complete opposite?

08:12.140 --> 08:20.180
It's like watching this, and then seeing the headline in the Daily Mail the next day, or

08:20.180 --> 08:23.740
seeing this headline in 1963.

08:23.740 --> 08:24.740
Or this.

08:24.740 --> 08:30.140
I often wonder just how outrageously wrong a claim has to be before critics of climate

08:30.140 --> 08:32.580
science have the sense to disown it.

08:32.580 --> 08:36.060
If you're going to see science as some kind of a game, does it really mean you have to

08:36.060 --> 08:40.640
defend someone on your team who says the sky is green?

08:40.640 --> 08:46.100
By all means castigate the IPCC for sloppy mistakes like the melting of Himalayan glaciers

08:46.100 --> 08:49.640
or Al Gore's misrepresentation of sea level rise.

08:49.640 --> 08:54.720
But then equally acknowledge the sloppy mistakes by researchers like Sun and Ballyunas, or

08:54.720 --> 08:58.200
fabrications in the film The Great Global Warming Swindle.

08:58.200 --> 09:02.720
If the Daily Mail obviously got something wrong, don't stubbornly insist it was right

09:02.720 --> 09:07.220
simply because it's on what you childishly believe is your side.

09:07.220 --> 09:11.360
We should all be mature enough to want to understand what's happening in nature, and

09:11.360 --> 09:15.320
acknowledge when something's right and when it's wrong.

09:15.320 --> 09:18.760
Another common complaint is that I've ignored something.

09:18.880 --> 09:23.880
Some of the myths people think I'm ignoring are on other videos, like the warming troposphere.

09:23.880 --> 09:28.240
You really have to watch them all before hitting the keyboard and saying I've missed something.

09:28.240 --> 09:32.340
Some of the myths I haven't dealt with yet, and other myths are completely new to me because

09:32.340 --> 09:35.680
they keep popping up on the internet like gophers.

09:35.680 --> 09:39.760
But Zebower, you can debunk a lot of these myths quite easily yourself.

09:39.760 --> 09:43.060
Just go online and find out where the information comes from.

09:43.060 --> 09:46.620
If there's no source for it, chances are it's made up.

09:46.620 --> 09:49.600
If a source is quoted, track that down.

09:49.600 --> 09:52.960
Then find out where that source got the information from.

09:52.960 --> 09:58.700
Track that right back to its origins, then compare the original research with the myth.

09:58.700 --> 10:02.180
And if you think something on Wikipedia, or something you thought up at the breakfast

10:02.180 --> 10:07.540
table, debunks a hundred years of well-researched physics, try to find out why researchers haven't

10:07.540 --> 10:09.580
thought of the same thing.

10:09.580 --> 10:14.260
Or why they do know about it, but don't come to the same conclusions that you do.

10:14.260 --> 10:18.360
I wish I could investigate other mistakes people say I've made in the videos, but for

10:18.360 --> 10:21.940
some reason they seem very reluctant to tell me what they are.

10:21.940 --> 10:25.700
All I get are generalisations like this.

10:25.700 --> 10:30.240
I don't mind being told I've made mistakes in the videos, I've repeatedly invited corrections

10:30.240 --> 10:34.140
because I want to ensure that any errors are expunged from my channel.

10:34.140 --> 10:38.620
So any time people tell me I'm lying or I've made mistakes, I've always asked them to specify

10:38.620 --> 10:40.480
what these are.

10:40.480 --> 10:44.520
The Warhead 3000 kept telling me the videos were full of lies, but couldn't summon up

10:44.520 --> 10:48.600
the strength to tell me where they were, I even posted a form for him to fill out to

10:48.600 --> 10:50.400
make it easier.

10:50.400 --> 10:54.640
So I would welcome the citation of any mistakes, and I don't even mind if they're characterised

10:54.640 --> 10:55.720
as lies.

10:55.720 --> 11:00.320
But if you're going to make accusations like these, do me the courtesy of substantiating

11:00.320 --> 11:01.320
them.

11:01.320 --> 11:04.820
I go to a lot of trouble to ensure that my videos are an accurate reporting of what's

11:04.820 --> 11:06.520
in the scientific literature.

11:06.520 --> 11:11.320
I have to go through dozens of papers, catalogue authors, publications, dates, and make notes

11:11.320 --> 11:12.840
on the evidence presented.

11:12.840 --> 11:16.760
I have to check references to make sure I've found and read every important paper on the

11:16.760 --> 11:17.760
issue.

11:17.760 --> 11:22.440
So if you claim these videos are full of lies and mistakes, then have the balls or the intelligence

11:22.440 --> 11:26.480
or the maturity or the integrity to point them out.

11:26.480 --> 11:30.200
After I've done all this work to present a factually accurate reflection of the science

11:30.200 --> 11:35.880
as best I can, and willingly agree to correct any mistakes, don't just hide behind fatuous

11:35.880 --> 11:38.960
accusations that you refuse to substantiate.

11:38.960 --> 11:43.520
You have no excuse not to follow up my sources, because they're given to you in full.

11:43.520 --> 11:46.040
I've got an open forum on every video.

11:46.040 --> 11:50.920
No comments on my videos get removed unless they breach the guidelines in the channel,

11:50.920 --> 11:52.720
and no one gets blocked.

11:52.720 --> 11:56.600
Saying that my videos are full of mistakes and then not being able to pinpoint a single

11:56.600 --> 12:02.220
mistake doesn't reflect badly on my videos, it reflects on your shallow level of intellect.

12:02.220 --> 12:06.640
It suggests that instead of lifting a finger to check a single fact, you're just sticking

12:06.640 --> 12:10.540
your fingers in your ears and shouting liar, because you've heard something you didn't

12:10.540 --> 12:12.340
particularly want to hear.

12:12.340 --> 12:16.020
This is not sceptical, it's infantile.

12:16.020 --> 12:21.400
Also again to detractors, please try to watch the videos before commenting, because mindlessly

12:21.400 --> 12:27.140
repeating a myth that's already been busted won't make it magically come to life again.

12:27.140 --> 12:31.300
In the fourth video of this series, I cited an analysis of the scientific literature in

12:31.300 --> 12:36.700
the 1970s, showing that the consensus of another ice age was a complete myth.

12:36.700 --> 12:37.700
Remember?

12:37.700 --> 12:43.900
Three climatologists searched scientific journals between 1965 and 1979.

12:43.900 --> 12:49.940
And yes, they found seven papers predicting not an ice age, but global cooling.

12:49.940 --> 12:55.580
The only problem is, they also found 44 articles predicting global warming.

12:55.580 --> 12:56.580
Well guess what?

12:56.580 --> 12:59.060
A good myth never dies.

12:59.060 --> 13:02.980
Thirty years ago, the scientific consensus was that the climate was cooling.

13:02.980 --> 13:07.500
According to scientists of the 1970s, we should be entering a mini ice age, remember that

13:07.500 --> 13:08.500
bit of science?

13:08.500 --> 13:10.500
No, I don't.

13:10.500 --> 13:11.700
And neither do you.

13:11.700 --> 13:15.980
This is either a figment of your imagination, or something you've read, and not being the

13:15.980 --> 13:20.860
least bit sceptical, something you swallowed without bothering to check.

13:20.860 --> 13:25.300
I also rebutted the misconception that an unusual weather event can be linked to climate

13:25.300 --> 13:26.300
change.

13:26.300 --> 13:31.500
Similarly, unusually cold weather doesn't show there's no anthropogenic climate change.

13:31.500 --> 13:36.220
Climate scientists take a moving average of temperatures globally over five to eleven

13:36.220 --> 13:41.460
years, so hands up those who still think we measure average global temperatures by looking

13:41.460 --> 13:44.420
out the bedroom window.

13:44.420 --> 13:47.900
Look I don't mind if you can show that the facts I present are erroneous.

13:47.900 --> 13:51.620
As I've said, I'd welcome that, because I don't like errors in my videos.

13:51.620 --> 13:57.060
So if I cite papers that show the solar system is not warming, and papers that show no significant

13:57.060 --> 14:01.780
solar activity over the last thirty years, then by all means show me how I read that

14:01.780 --> 14:05.260
incorrectly, or cite other research that overturns it.

14:05.260 --> 14:08.220
Don't just repeat the same old internet myths.

14:08.220 --> 14:10.060
Like this.

14:10.060 --> 14:15.660
Unfortunately, times run out, so I'm going to do two separate videos to look at alleged

14:15.660 --> 14:19.880
mistakes in Meet the Scientists and those hacked emails.

14:19.880 --> 14:22.980
These videos seem to have provoked the most vehement responses.
