0	5340	I thought I'd spend a bit of time making corrections, responding to criticisms, and perhaps clarifying
5340	6340	a few things.
6340	11640	First of all, thanks for the messages, positive and negative, and I assure you that I do appreciate
11640	13140	and read them.
13140	16800	One of the most common questions I get asked is, why don't you make more videos?
16800	18600	Well, the reason is simple.
18600	22640	To make just one video, I first have to spend a lot of time listening to what's being claimed
22640	25840	on the internet, in newspapers and TV reports.
25840	30520	I have to ensure that any myth I debunk is something that's widespread and popularly
30520	31520	believed.
31520	35400	That way I can't be accused of creating a straw man argument.
35400	39220	Then I spend even more time going through the scientific literature and reading papers
39220	41760	that deal with that particular subject.
41760	45640	If I didn't bother doing all this research, then of course I could churn out several videos
45640	50680	a week, just by sitting in front of a video camera and spouting opinions and beliefs.
50680	55040	The whole point of this channel is to get away from mindless opinion and belief, and
55040	58840	to explain science as it's represented in the scientific literature.
58840	63840	I thought Monitor 301 summed it up rather well in this comment from the forum of my
63840	65640	video, Who Am I?
65640	69180	No noteworthy scientific credentials to speak of.
69180	70720	He's referring to me.
70720	73360	And a similar point from Research Siempre.
73360	74680	Who is potholder?
74680	77360	And what scientific research has he conducted?
77360	80400	Just reading IPCC talking points doesn't count.
80400	84720	Well, I'm happy to tell you that I don't do any scientific research.
84720	89000	All I can do is report what people who do have scientific credentials have discovered
89000	91240	through their research.
91240	96200	By the way, Research Siempre, I don't use the IPCC as a source, as you could quite easily
96200	102200	ascertain by reading the list of my sources provided on the videos and in the video descriptions.
102200	106240	In a similar vein, this kind of comment was also quite common.
106240	109400	Pothola54 claims that CO2 drives warming.
109400	114160	Actually, the claim is that CO2 is one of the factors that drives climate, but never
114160	115160	mind.
115160	119280	The point is, it's not my claim, because I'm not a climate researcher.
119280	123640	What's presented in my videos are the discoveries and conclusions of people who are climate
123640	124640	researchers.
124640	128160	Now, of course, I may get things wrong in reporting the science.
128160	133280	In my last series, Our Origins Made Easy, I issued two errata videos correcting mistakes
133280	137540	that had been pointed out by viewers, and I'm also very grateful to those who've pointed
137540	142200	out mistakes in the climate change series, so here they are.
142200	145720	Several people noticed that this animation in the first video was wrong.
145720	150000	It should be the electron shells that are excited, not the nucleus.
150000	154740	Zebauer pointed out a mistake in language in my video Climate Change the Objections,
154740	155740	in which I said this.
155740	161360	A very good correlation between global temperatures and solar output over most of the last 250
161360	166560	years, but not the very period that covers a dramatic rise in global temperatures.
166560	170360	I agree the term dramatic is meaningless and hyperbolic.
170360	175600	Scientifically speaking, the rise in temperatures should be described as statistically significant.
175600	180240	In other words, it's due to something other than normal background fluctuations.
180240	184580	There were two mistakes in my most recent video, hurricanes, atolls and coral.
184580	189200	The calcium carbonate that makes up coral skeletons takes the mineral form aragonite,
189200	193920	not calcite, and the chemical equation I showed in the paper related to lower saturation of
193920	198520	carbonate ions in seawater, not the formation of carbonic acid.
198520	203200	This is yet another problem for coral that I didn't have time to discuss, but both saturation
203200	206320	and acidification are discussed in the same paper.
206320	209320	I just put up the wrong image by mistake.
209320	213080	Here's another error in my videos which looks rather serious.
213080	215400	This guy potholer isn't worth the time to watch.
215400	219480	I caught him in another video manipulating data the second after claiming the other side
219480	220960	of the debate is manipulating.
220960	223620	I've been manipulating data?
223620	228940	Well then, I definitely have to correct this and apologise profusely to my subscribers.
228940	231700	What did I manipulate, night version?
231700	236180	In the video climate change supplement at around one minute, watch how he uses the images
236180	239540	to jump past Jones's reply to question A and jumps to B.
239540	243540	Oh, so I didn't manipulate any data at all.
243540	245260	Apparently, I missed something.
245260	248680	Okay, still, let's take a look and see what I missed.
248680	251660	Here's the part of the video night version mentions.
251660	252740	Night version goes on.
252740	255300	I tried to read the text, but it is concealed.
255300	258180	Well, no, it's not concealed at all.
258180	262660	I was just giving you an establishing shot to show the webpage with the BBC logo at the
262660	268020	top and then I dissolved to the answer that was the focus of the Daily Mail story.
268020	273340	If you want to see the entire BBC webpage, I give a link to it in my video description,
273340	278340	so if I did want to conceal this information, obviously I'm doing a piss poor job.
278340	281820	He does this because he doesn't like Jones's answer to A.
281820	285460	But science has nothing to do with liking or disliking answers.
285460	290020	It's only concerned with whether answers are based on proper observation and are correct.
290020	294780	No, the reason I focused on the answer to question B is because that was the focus of
294780	299080	the Daily Mail headline that was copied all over the internet.
299080	301740	So what is this mysterious answer A?
301740	308820	Well, Jones looks at three periods of warming over the past 150 years, 1860 to 1880, 1910
308820	312900	to 1940 and 1975 to 2009.
312900	318140	And he told the BBC all three have statistically significant periods of warming.
318140	322140	At first I didn't know why Knight version thought this was so extraordinary.
322140	326620	You can find these and other examples of past warming in dozens of papers and they are clearly
326620	328660	shown in reconstructions.
328660	332820	But then I searched the political websites and it turns out that this is yet another
332820	337780	argument that climate change is natural, the climate always changes and that there is nothing
337780	341140	unusual about the current rise in temperatures.
341140	345140	Anyone who's watched this series knows that of course that's true.
345140	349700	Carbon dioxide is a natural gas that's been around for billions of years and many times
349700	354420	in the past the Earth has warmed and cooled as levels of carbon dioxide have risen and
354420	355460	fallen.
355460	358000	But as I've also mentioned more than onceâ€¦
358000	362700	The climate isn't driven by carbon dioxide alone because carbon dioxide isn't the only
362700	364780	factor that affects global temperatures.
364780	368860	I don't want to go through all this again, just watch the earlier videos.
368860	372580	Climate is driven by a number of different factors known as forcings.
372580	378420	The 1860 to 1880 rise in temperatures coincided with an increase in solar forcing.
378420	384000	The 1910 to 1940 period also experienced solar forcing but climatologists have found other
384000	389380	influencing factors such as higher levels of carbon dioxide and Atlantic Ocean circulation
389380	390460	patterns.
390500	396140	All these forcings have to be looked at together, not just carbon dioxide alone.
396140	400700	While we're on the subject of the BBC Jones Q&A, Guffpot, who writes more words on my
400700	405420	channel than I do, insisted that the Daily Mail got its headline right.
405420	410260	So as always when someone points out a mistake, I ask where and when Jones had said there'd
410260	413220	been no warming since 1995.
413220	417940	Guffpot responded, are you really insisting those specific words must be spoken?
417980	423180	No, but I do insist that if a newspaper is going to paraphrase, then it does have a duty
423180	427120	not to completely change the meaning of what someone says.
427120	431260	In case I made a mistake, let's look again at what Jones really did say.
431260	435860	I also calculated the trend for the period 1995 to 2009.
435860	441020	This trend at 0.12 degrees centigrade per decade is positive.
441020	445380	To correctly paraphrase what Jones is saying, the temperature trend is up.
445380	450740	He's saying the Earth has been warming by about 0.12 degrees centigrade per decade since
450740	452140	1995.
452140	457340	He goes on, but not significant at the 95% significance level.
457340	461260	The positive trend is quite close to the significance level.
461260	465820	In other words, there's maybe a 90% confidence level that it's more likely than not that
465820	472220	the warming is caused by something other than background fluctuations, but we can't be 95%
472220	473300	confident of that.
473300	477380	We're confident we are about the cause of this warming, whether it's due to carbon dioxide,
477380	480480	reflections from the Moon, or Al Gore letting off steam.
480480	486180	The fact is, Jones said that the Earth has been warming since 1995.
486180	492140	Could anyone really think the Daily Mail got that right when it claimed the complete opposite?
492140	500180	It's like watching this, and then seeing the headline in the Daily Mail the next day, or
500180	503740	seeing this headline in 1963.
503740	504740	Or this.
504740	510140	I often wonder just how outrageously wrong a claim has to be before critics of climate
510140	512580	science have the sense to disown it.
512580	516060	If you're going to see science as some kind of a game, does it really mean you have to
516060	520640	defend someone on your team who says the sky is green?
520640	526100	By all means castigate the IPCC for sloppy mistakes like the melting of Himalayan glaciers
526100	529640	or Al Gore's misrepresentation of sea level rise.
529640	534720	But then equally acknowledge the sloppy mistakes by researchers like Sun and Ballyunas, or
534720	538200	fabrications in the film The Great Global Warming Swindle.
538200	542720	If the Daily Mail obviously got something wrong, don't stubbornly insist it was right
542720	547220	simply because it's on what you childishly believe is your side.
547220	551360	We should all be mature enough to want to understand what's happening in nature, and
551360	555320	acknowledge when something's right and when it's wrong.
555320	558760	Another common complaint is that I've ignored something.
558880	563880	Some of the myths people think I'm ignoring are on other videos, like the warming troposphere.
563880	568240	You really have to watch them all before hitting the keyboard and saying I've missed something.
568240	572340	Some of the myths I haven't dealt with yet, and other myths are completely new to me because
572340	575680	they keep popping up on the internet like gophers.
575680	579760	But Zebower, you can debunk a lot of these myths quite easily yourself.
579760	583060	Just go online and find out where the information comes from.
583060	586620	If there's no source for it, chances are it's made up.
586620	589600	If a source is quoted, track that down.
589600	592960	Then find out where that source got the information from.
592960	598700	Track that right back to its origins, then compare the original research with the myth.
598700	602180	And if you think something on Wikipedia, or something you thought up at the breakfast
602180	607540	table, debunks a hundred years of well-researched physics, try to find out why researchers haven't
607540	609580	thought of the same thing.
609580	614260	Or why they do know about it, but don't come to the same conclusions that you do.
614260	618360	I wish I could investigate other mistakes people say I've made in the videos, but for
618360	621940	some reason they seem very reluctant to tell me what they are.
621940	625700	All I get are generalisations like this.
625700	630240	I don't mind being told I've made mistakes in the videos, I've repeatedly invited corrections
630240	634140	because I want to ensure that any errors are expunged from my channel.
634140	638620	So any time people tell me I'm lying or I've made mistakes, I've always asked them to specify
638620	640480	what these are.
640480	644520	The Warhead 3000 kept telling me the videos were full of lies, but couldn't summon up
644520	648600	the strength to tell me where they were, I even posted a form for him to fill out to
648600	650400	make it easier.
650400	654640	So I would welcome the citation of any mistakes, and I don't even mind if they're characterised
654640	655720	as lies.
655720	660320	But if you're going to make accusations like these, do me the courtesy of substantiating
660320	661320	them.
661320	664820	I go to a lot of trouble to ensure that my videos are an accurate reporting of what's
664820	666520	in the scientific literature.
666520	671320	I have to go through dozens of papers, catalogue authors, publications, dates, and make notes
671320	672840	on the evidence presented.
672840	676760	I have to check references to make sure I've found and read every important paper on the
676760	677760	issue.
677760	682440	So if you claim these videos are full of lies and mistakes, then have the balls or the intelligence
682440	686480	or the maturity or the integrity to point them out.
686480	690200	After I've done all this work to present a factually accurate reflection of the science
690200	695880	as best I can, and willingly agree to correct any mistakes, don't just hide behind fatuous
695880	698960	accusations that you refuse to substantiate.
698960	703520	You have no excuse not to follow up my sources, because they're given to you in full.
703520	706040	I've got an open forum on every video.
706040	710920	No comments on my videos get removed unless they breach the guidelines in the channel,
710920	712720	and no one gets blocked.
712720	716600	Saying that my videos are full of mistakes and then not being able to pinpoint a single
716600	722220	mistake doesn't reflect badly on my videos, it reflects on your shallow level of intellect.
722220	726640	It suggests that instead of lifting a finger to check a single fact, you're just sticking
726640	730540	your fingers in your ears and shouting liar, because you've heard something you didn't
730540	732340	particularly want to hear.
732340	736020	This is not sceptical, it's infantile.
736020	741400	Also again to detractors, please try to watch the videos before commenting, because mindlessly
741400	747140	repeating a myth that's already been busted won't make it magically come to life again.
747140	751300	In the fourth video of this series, I cited an analysis of the scientific literature in
751300	756700	the 1970s, showing that the consensus of another ice age was a complete myth.
756700	757700	Remember?
757700	763900	Three climatologists searched scientific journals between 1965 and 1979.
763900	769940	And yes, they found seven papers predicting not an ice age, but global cooling.
769940	775580	The only problem is, they also found 44 articles predicting global warming.
775580	776580	Well guess what?
776580	779060	A good myth never dies.
779060	782980	Thirty years ago, the scientific consensus was that the climate was cooling.
782980	787500	According to scientists of the 1970s, we should be entering a mini ice age, remember that
787500	788500	bit of science?
788500	790500	No, I don't.
790500	791700	And neither do you.
791700	795980	This is either a figment of your imagination, or something you've read, and not being the
795980	800860	least bit sceptical, something you swallowed without bothering to check.
800860	805300	I also rebutted the misconception that an unusual weather event can be linked to climate
805300	806300	change.
806300	811500	Similarly, unusually cold weather doesn't show there's no anthropogenic climate change.
811500	816220	Climate scientists take a moving average of temperatures globally over five to eleven
816220	821460	years, so hands up those who still think we measure average global temperatures by looking
821460	824420	out the bedroom window.
824420	827900	Look I don't mind if you can show that the facts I present are erroneous.
827900	831620	As I've said, I'd welcome that, because I don't like errors in my videos.
831620	837060	So if I cite papers that show the solar system is not warming, and papers that show no significant
837060	841780	solar activity over the last thirty years, then by all means show me how I read that
841780	845260	incorrectly, or cite other research that overturns it.
845260	848220	Don't just repeat the same old internet myths.
848220	850060	Like this.
850060	855660	Unfortunately, times run out, so I'm going to do two separate videos to look at alleged
855660	859880	mistakes in Meet the Scientists and those hacked emails.
859880	862980	These videos seem to have provoked the most vehement responses.
