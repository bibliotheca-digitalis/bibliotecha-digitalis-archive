1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,340
I thought I'd spend a bit of time making corrections, responding to criticisms, and perhaps clarifying

2
00:00:05,340 --> 00:00:06,340
a few things.

3
00:00:06,340 --> 00:00:11,640
First of all, thanks for the messages, positive and negative, and I assure you that I do appreciate

4
00:00:11,640 --> 00:00:13,140
and read them.

5
00:00:13,140 --> 00:00:16,800
One of the most common questions I get asked is, why don't you make more videos?

6
00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:18,600
Well, the reason is simple.

7
00:00:18,600 --> 00:00:22,640
To make just one video, I first have to spend a lot of time listening to what's being claimed

8
00:00:22,640 --> 00:00:25,840
on the internet, in newspapers and TV reports.

9
00:00:25,840 --> 00:00:30,520
I have to ensure that any myth I debunk is something that's widespread and popularly

10
00:00:30,520 --> 00:00:31,520
believed.

11
00:00:31,520 --> 00:00:35,400
That way I can't be accused of creating a straw man argument.

12
00:00:35,400 --> 00:00:39,220
Then I spend even more time going through the scientific literature and reading papers

13
00:00:39,220 --> 00:00:41,760
that deal with that particular subject.

14
00:00:41,760 --> 00:00:45,640
If I didn't bother doing all this research, then of course I could churn out several videos

15
00:00:45,640 --> 00:00:50,680
a week, just by sitting in front of a video camera and spouting opinions and beliefs.

16
00:00:50,680 --> 00:00:55,040
The whole point of this channel is to get away from mindless opinion and belief, and

17
00:00:55,040 --> 00:00:58,840
to explain science as it's represented in the scientific literature.

18
00:00:58,840 --> 00:01:03,840
I thought Monitor 301 summed it up rather well in this comment from the forum of my

19
00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:05,640
video, Who Am I?

20
00:01:05,640 --> 00:01:09,180
No noteworthy scientific credentials to speak of.

21
00:01:09,180 --> 00:01:10,720
He's referring to me.

22
00:01:10,720 --> 00:01:13,360
And a similar point from Research Siempre.

23
00:01:13,360 --> 00:01:14,680
Who is potholder?

24
00:01:14,680 --> 00:01:17,360
And what scientific research has he conducted?

25
00:01:17,360 --> 00:01:20,400
Just reading IPCC talking points doesn't count.

26
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:24,720
Well, I'm happy to tell you that I don't do any scientific research.

27
00:01:24,720 --> 00:01:29,000
All I can do is report what people who do have scientific credentials have discovered

28
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:31,240
through their research.

29
00:01:31,240 --> 00:01:36,200
By the way, Research Siempre, I don't use the IPCC as a source, as you could quite easily

30
00:01:36,200 --> 00:01:42,200
ascertain by reading the list of my sources provided on the videos and in the video descriptions.

31
00:01:42,200 --> 00:01:46,240
In a similar vein, this kind of comment was also quite common.

32
00:01:46,240 --> 00:01:49,400
Pothola54 claims that CO2 drives warming.

33
00:01:49,400 --> 00:01:54,160
Actually, the claim is that CO2 is one of the factors that drives climate, but never

34
00:01:54,160 --> 00:01:55,160
mind.

35
00:01:55,160 --> 00:01:59,280
The point is, it's not my claim, because I'm not a climate researcher.

36
00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:03,640
What's presented in my videos are the discoveries and conclusions of people who are climate

37
00:02:03,640 --> 00:02:04,640
researchers.

38
00:02:04,640 --> 00:02:08,160
Now, of course, I may get things wrong in reporting the science.

39
00:02:08,160 --> 00:02:13,280
In my last series, Our Origins Made Easy, I issued two errata videos correcting mistakes

40
00:02:13,280 --> 00:02:17,540
that had been pointed out by viewers, and I'm also very grateful to those who've pointed

41
00:02:17,540 --> 00:02:22,200
out mistakes in the climate change series, so here they are.

42
00:02:22,200 --> 00:02:25,720
Several people noticed that this animation in the first video was wrong.

43
00:02:25,720 --> 00:02:30,000
It should be the electron shells that are excited, not the nucleus.

44
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:34,740
Zebauer pointed out a mistake in language in my video Climate Change the Objections,

45
00:02:34,740 --> 00:02:35,740
in which I said this.

46
00:02:35,740 --> 00:02:41,360
A very good correlation between global temperatures and solar output over most of the last 250

47
00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:46,560
years, but not the very period that covers a dramatic rise in global temperatures.

48
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:50,360
I agree the term dramatic is meaningless and hyperbolic.

49
00:02:50,360 --> 00:02:55,600
Scientifically speaking, the rise in temperatures should be described as statistically significant.

50
00:02:55,600 --> 00:03:00,240
In other words, it's due to something other than normal background fluctuations.

51
00:03:00,240 --> 00:03:04,580
There were two mistakes in my most recent video, hurricanes, atolls and coral.

52
00:03:04,580 --> 00:03:09,200
The calcium carbonate that makes up coral skeletons takes the mineral form aragonite,

53
00:03:09,200 --> 00:03:13,920
not calcite, and the chemical equation I showed in the paper related to lower saturation of

54
00:03:13,920 --> 00:03:18,520
carbonate ions in seawater, not the formation of carbonic acid.

55
00:03:18,520 --> 00:03:23,200
This is yet another problem for coral that I didn't have time to discuss, but both saturation

56
00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:26,320
and acidification are discussed in the same paper.

57
00:03:26,320 --> 00:03:29,320
I just put up the wrong image by mistake.

58
00:03:29,320 --> 00:03:33,080
Here's another error in my videos which looks rather serious.

59
00:03:33,080 --> 00:03:35,400
This guy potholer isn't worth the time to watch.

60
00:03:35,400 --> 00:03:39,480
I caught him in another video manipulating data the second after claiming the other side

61
00:03:39,480 --> 00:03:40,960
of the debate is manipulating.

62
00:03:40,960 --> 00:03:43,620
I've been manipulating data?

63
00:03:43,620 --> 00:03:48,940
Well then, I definitely have to correct this and apologise profusely to my subscribers.

64
00:03:48,940 --> 00:03:51,700
What did I manipulate, night version?

65
00:03:51,700 --> 00:03:56,180
In the video climate change supplement at around one minute, watch how he uses the images

66
00:03:56,180 --> 00:03:59,540
to jump past Jones's reply to question A and jumps to B.

67
00:03:59,540 --> 00:04:03,540
Oh, so I didn't manipulate any data at all.

68
00:04:03,540 --> 00:04:05,260
Apparently, I missed something.

69
00:04:05,260 --> 00:04:08,680
Okay, still, let's take a look and see what I missed.

70
00:04:08,680 --> 00:04:11,660
Here's the part of the video night version mentions.

71
00:04:11,660 --> 00:04:12,740
Night version goes on.

72
00:04:12,740 --> 00:04:15,300
I tried to read the text, but it is concealed.

73
00:04:15,300 --> 00:04:18,180
Well, no, it's not concealed at all.

74
00:04:18,180 --> 00:04:22,660
I was just giving you an establishing shot to show the webpage with the BBC logo at the

75
00:04:22,660 --> 00:04:28,020
top and then I dissolved to the answer that was the focus of the Daily Mail story.

76
00:04:28,020 --> 00:04:33,340
If you want to see the entire BBC webpage, I give a link to it in my video description,

77
00:04:33,340 --> 00:04:38,340
so if I did want to conceal this information, obviously I'm doing a piss poor job.

78
00:04:38,340 --> 00:04:41,820
He does this because he doesn't like Jones's answer to A.

79
00:04:41,820 --> 00:04:45,460
But science has nothing to do with liking or disliking answers.

80
00:04:45,460 --> 00:04:50,020
It's only concerned with whether answers are based on proper observation and are correct.

81
00:04:50,020 --> 00:04:54,780
No, the reason I focused on the answer to question B is because that was the focus of

82
00:04:54,780 --> 00:04:59,080
the Daily Mail headline that was copied all over the internet.

83
00:04:59,080 --> 00:05:01,740
So what is this mysterious answer A?

84
00:05:01,740 --> 00:05:08,820
Well, Jones looks at three periods of warming over the past 150 years, 1860 to 1880, 1910

85
00:05:08,820 --> 00:05:12,900
to 1940 and 1975 to 2009.

86
00:05:12,900 --> 00:05:18,140
And he told the BBC all three have statistically significant periods of warming.

87
00:05:18,140 --> 00:05:22,140
At first I didn't know why Knight version thought this was so extraordinary.

88
00:05:22,140 --> 00:05:26,620
You can find these and other examples of past warming in dozens of papers and they are clearly

89
00:05:26,620 --> 00:05:28,660
shown in reconstructions.

90
00:05:28,660 --> 00:05:32,820
But then I searched the political websites and it turns out that this is yet another

91
00:05:32,820 --> 00:05:37,780
argument that climate change is natural, the climate always changes and that there is nothing

92
00:05:37,780 --> 00:05:41,140
unusual about the current rise in temperatures.

93
00:05:41,140 --> 00:05:45,140
Anyone who's watched this series knows that of course that's true.

94
00:05:45,140 --> 00:05:49,700
Carbon dioxide is a natural gas that's been around for billions of years and many times

95
00:05:49,700 --> 00:05:54,420
in the past the Earth has warmed and cooled as levels of carbon dioxide have risen and

96
00:05:54,420 --> 00:05:55,460
fallen.

97
00:05:55,460 --> 00:05:58,000
But as I've also mentioned more than onceâ€¦

98
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:02,700
The climate isn't driven by carbon dioxide alone because carbon dioxide isn't the only

99
00:06:02,700 --> 00:06:04,780
factor that affects global temperatures.

100
00:06:04,780 --> 00:06:08,860
I don't want to go through all this again, just watch the earlier videos.

101
00:06:08,860 --> 00:06:12,580
Climate is driven by a number of different factors known as forcings.

102
00:06:12,580 --> 00:06:18,420
The 1860 to 1880 rise in temperatures coincided with an increase in solar forcing.

103
00:06:18,420 --> 00:06:24,000
The 1910 to 1940 period also experienced solar forcing but climatologists have found other

104
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:29,380
influencing factors such as higher levels of carbon dioxide and Atlantic Ocean circulation

105
00:06:29,380 --> 00:06:30,460
patterns.

106
00:06:30,500 --> 00:06:36,140
All these forcings have to be looked at together, not just carbon dioxide alone.

107
00:06:36,140 --> 00:06:40,700
While we're on the subject of the BBC Jones Q&A, Guffpot, who writes more words on my

108
00:06:40,700 --> 00:06:45,420
channel than I do, insisted that the Daily Mail got its headline right.

109
00:06:45,420 --> 00:06:50,260
So as always when someone points out a mistake, I ask where and when Jones had said there'd

110
00:06:50,260 --> 00:06:53,220
been no warming since 1995.

111
00:06:53,220 --> 00:06:57,940
Guffpot responded, are you really insisting those specific words must be spoken?

112
00:06:57,980 --> 00:07:03,180
No, but I do insist that if a newspaper is going to paraphrase, then it does have a duty

113
00:07:03,180 --> 00:07:07,120
not to completely change the meaning of what someone says.

114
00:07:07,120 --> 00:07:11,260
In case I made a mistake, let's look again at what Jones really did say.

115
00:07:11,260 --> 00:07:15,860
I also calculated the trend for the period 1995 to 2009.

116
00:07:15,860 --> 00:07:21,020
This trend at 0.12 degrees centigrade per decade is positive.

117
00:07:21,020 --> 00:07:25,380
To correctly paraphrase what Jones is saying, the temperature trend is up.

118
00:07:25,380 --> 00:07:30,740
He's saying the Earth has been warming by about 0.12 degrees centigrade per decade since

119
00:07:30,740 --> 00:07:32,140
1995.

120
00:07:32,140 --> 00:07:37,340
He goes on, but not significant at the 95% significance level.

121
00:07:37,340 --> 00:07:41,260
The positive trend is quite close to the significance level.

122
00:07:41,260 --> 00:07:45,820
In other words, there's maybe a 90% confidence level that it's more likely than not that

123
00:07:45,820 --> 00:07:52,220
the warming is caused by something other than background fluctuations, but we can't be 95%

124
00:07:52,220 --> 00:07:53,300
confident of that.

125
00:07:53,300 --> 00:07:57,380
We're confident we are about the cause of this warming, whether it's due to carbon dioxide,

126
00:07:57,380 --> 00:08:00,480
reflections from the Moon, or Al Gore letting off steam.

127
00:08:00,480 --> 00:08:06,180
The fact is, Jones said that the Earth has been warming since 1995.

128
00:08:06,180 --> 00:08:12,140
Could anyone really think the Daily Mail got that right when it claimed the complete opposite?

129
00:08:12,140 --> 00:08:20,180
It's like watching this, and then seeing the headline in the Daily Mail the next day, or

130
00:08:20,180 --> 00:08:23,740
seeing this headline in 1963.

131
00:08:23,740 --> 00:08:24,740
Or this.

132
00:08:24,740 --> 00:08:30,140
I often wonder just how outrageously wrong a claim has to be before critics of climate

133
00:08:30,140 --> 00:08:32,580
science have the sense to disown it.

134
00:08:32,580 --> 00:08:36,060
If you're going to see science as some kind of a game, does it really mean you have to

135
00:08:36,060 --> 00:08:40,640
defend someone on your team who says the sky is green?

136
00:08:40,640 --> 00:08:46,100
By all means castigate the IPCC for sloppy mistakes like the melting of Himalayan glaciers

137
00:08:46,100 --> 00:08:49,640
or Al Gore's misrepresentation of sea level rise.

138
00:08:49,640 --> 00:08:54,720
But then equally acknowledge the sloppy mistakes by researchers like Sun and Ballyunas, or

139
00:08:54,720 --> 00:08:58,200
fabrications in the film The Great Global Warming Swindle.

140
00:08:58,200 --> 00:09:02,720
If the Daily Mail obviously got something wrong, don't stubbornly insist it was right

141
00:09:02,720 --> 00:09:07,220
simply because it's on what you childishly believe is your side.

142
00:09:07,220 --> 00:09:11,360
We should all be mature enough to want to understand what's happening in nature, and

143
00:09:11,360 --> 00:09:15,320
acknowledge when something's right and when it's wrong.

144
00:09:15,320 --> 00:09:18,760
Another common complaint is that I've ignored something.

145
00:09:18,880 --> 00:09:23,880
Some of the myths people think I'm ignoring are on other videos, like the warming troposphere.

146
00:09:23,880 --> 00:09:28,240
You really have to watch them all before hitting the keyboard and saying I've missed something.

147
00:09:28,240 --> 00:09:32,340
Some of the myths I haven't dealt with yet, and other myths are completely new to me because

148
00:09:32,340 --> 00:09:35,680
they keep popping up on the internet like gophers.

149
00:09:35,680 --> 00:09:39,760
But Zebower, you can debunk a lot of these myths quite easily yourself.

150
00:09:39,760 --> 00:09:43,060
Just go online and find out where the information comes from.

151
00:09:43,060 --> 00:09:46,620
If there's no source for it, chances are it's made up.

152
00:09:46,620 --> 00:09:49,600
If a source is quoted, track that down.

153
00:09:49,600 --> 00:09:52,960
Then find out where that source got the information from.

154
00:09:52,960 --> 00:09:58,700
Track that right back to its origins, then compare the original research with the myth.

155
00:09:58,700 --> 00:10:02,180
And if you think something on Wikipedia, or something you thought up at the breakfast

156
00:10:02,180 --> 00:10:07,540
table, debunks a hundred years of well-researched physics, try to find out why researchers haven't

157
00:10:07,540 --> 00:10:09,580
thought of the same thing.

158
00:10:09,580 --> 00:10:14,260
Or why they do know about it, but don't come to the same conclusions that you do.

159
00:10:14,260 --> 00:10:18,360
I wish I could investigate other mistakes people say I've made in the videos, but for

160
00:10:18,360 --> 00:10:21,940
some reason they seem very reluctant to tell me what they are.

161
00:10:21,940 --> 00:10:25,700
All I get are generalisations like this.

162
00:10:25,700 --> 00:10:30,240
I don't mind being told I've made mistakes in the videos, I've repeatedly invited corrections

163
00:10:30,240 --> 00:10:34,140
because I want to ensure that any errors are expunged from my channel.

164
00:10:34,140 --> 00:10:38,620
So any time people tell me I'm lying or I've made mistakes, I've always asked them to specify

165
00:10:38,620 --> 00:10:40,480
what these are.

166
00:10:40,480 --> 00:10:44,520
The Warhead 3000 kept telling me the videos were full of lies, but couldn't summon up

167
00:10:44,520 --> 00:10:48,600
the strength to tell me where they were, I even posted a form for him to fill out to

168
00:10:48,600 --> 00:10:50,400
make it easier.

169
00:10:50,400 --> 00:10:54,640
So I would welcome the citation of any mistakes, and I don't even mind if they're characterised

170
00:10:54,640 --> 00:10:55,720
as lies.

171
00:10:55,720 --> 00:11:00,320
But if you're going to make accusations like these, do me the courtesy of substantiating

172
00:11:00,320 --> 00:11:01,320
them.

173
00:11:01,320 --> 00:11:04,820
I go to a lot of trouble to ensure that my videos are an accurate reporting of what's

174
00:11:04,820 --> 00:11:06,520
in the scientific literature.

175
00:11:06,520 --> 00:11:11,320
I have to go through dozens of papers, catalogue authors, publications, dates, and make notes

176
00:11:11,320 --> 00:11:12,840
on the evidence presented.

177
00:11:12,840 --> 00:11:16,760
I have to check references to make sure I've found and read every important paper on the

178
00:11:16,760 --> 00:11:17,760
issue.

179
00:11:17,760 --> 00:11:22,440
So if you claim these videos are full of lies and mistakes, then have the balls or the intelligence

180
00:11:22,440 --> 00:11:26,480
or the maturity or the integrity to point them out.

181
00:11:26,480 --> 00:11:30,200
After I've done all this work to present a factually accurate reflection of the science

182
00:11:30,200 --> 00:11:35,880
as best I can, and willingly agree to correct any mistakes, don't just hide behind fatuous

183
00:11:35,880 --> 00:11:38,960
accusations that you refuse to substantiate.

184
00:11:38,960 --> 00:11:43,520
You have no excuse not to follow up my sources, because they're given to you in full.

185
00:11:43,520 --> 00:11:46,040
I've got an open forum on every video.

186
00:11:46,040 --> 00:11:50,920
No comments on my videos get removed unless they breach the guidelines in the channel,

187
00:11:50,920 --> 00:11:52,720
and no one gets blocked.

188
00:11:52,720 --> 00:11:56,600
Saying that my videos are full of mistakes and then not being able to pinpoint a single

189
00:11:56,600 --> 00:12:02,220
mistake doesn't reflect badly on my videos, it reflects on your shallow level of intellect.

190
00:12:02,220 --> 00:12:06,640
It suggests that instead of lifting a finger to check a single fact, you're just sticking

191
00:12:06,640 --> 00:12:10,540
your fingers in your ears and shouting liar, because you've heard something you didn't

192
00:12:10,540 --> 00:12:12,340
particularly want to hear.

193
00:12:12,340 --> 00:12:16,020
This is not sceptical, it's infantile.

194
00:12:16,020 --> 00:12:21,400
Also again to detractors, please try to watch the videos before commenting, because mindlessly

195
00:12:21,400 --> 00:12:27,140
repeating a myth that's already been busted won't make it magically come to life again.

196
00:12:27,140 --> 00:12:31,300
In the fourth video of this series, I cited an analysis of the scientific literature in

197
00:12:31,300 --> 00:12:36,700
the 1970s, showing that the consensus of another ice age was a complete myth.

198
00:12:36,700 --> 00:12:37,700
Remember?

199
00:12:37,700 --> 00:12:43,900
Three climatologists searched scientific journals between 1965 and 1979.

200
00:12:43,900 --> 00:12:49,940
And yes, they found seven papers predicting not an ice age, but global cooling.

201
00:12:49,940 --> 00:12:55,580
The only problem is, they also found 44 articles predicting global warming.

202
00:12:55,580 --> 00:12:56,580
Well guess what?

203
00:12:56,580 --> 00:12:59,060
A good myth never dies.

204
00:12:59,060 --> 00:13:02,980
Thirty years ago, the scientific consensus was that the climate was cooling.

205
00:13:02,980 --> 00:13:07,500
According to scientists of the 1970s, we should be entering a mini ice age, remember that

206
00:13:07,500 --> 00:13:08,500
bit of science?

207
00:13:08,500 --> 00:13:10,500
No, I don't.

208
00:13:10,500 --> 00:13:11,700
And neither do you.

209
00:13:11,700 --> 00:13:15,980
This is either a figment of your imagination, or something you've read, and not being the

210
00:13:15,980 --> 00:13:20,860
least bit sceptical, something you swallowed without bothering to check.

211
00:13:20,860 --> 00:13:25,300
I also rebutted the misconception that an unusual weather event can be linked to climate

212
00:13:25,300 --> 00:13:26,300
change.

213
00:13:26,300 --> 00:13:31,500
Similarly, unusually cold weather doesn't show there's no anthropogenic climate change.

214
00:13:31,500 --> 00:13:36,220
Climate scientists take a moving average of temperatures globally over five to eleven

215
00:13:36,220 --> 00:13:41,460
years, so hands up those who still think we measure average global temperatures by looking

216
00:13:41,460 --> 00:13:44,420
out the bedroom window.

217
00:13:44,420 --> 00:13:47,900
Look I don't mind if you can show that the facts I present are erroneous.

218
00:13:47,900 --> 00:13:51,620
As I've said, I'd welcome that, because I don't like errors in my videos.

219
00:13:51,620 --> 00:13:57,060
So if I cite papers that show the solar system is not warming, and papers that show no significant

220
00:13:57,060 --> 00:14:01,780
solar activity over the last thirty years, then by all means show me how I read that

221
00:14:01,780 --> 00:14:05,260
incorrectly, or cite other research that overturns it.

222
00:14:05,260 --> 00:14:08,220
Don't just repeat the same old internet myths.

223
00:14:08,220 --> 00:14:10,060
Like this.

224
00:14:10,060 --> 00:14:15,660
Unfortunately, times run out, so I'm going to do two separate videos to look at alleged

225
00:14:15,660 --> 00:14:19,880
mistakes in Meet the Scientists and those hacked emails.

226
00:14:19,880 --> 00:14:22,980
These videos seem to have provoked the most vehement responses.
