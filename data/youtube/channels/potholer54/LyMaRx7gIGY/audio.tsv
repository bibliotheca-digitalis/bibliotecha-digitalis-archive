0	5840	Global warming is a myth, according to 400 scientific papers published this year.
5840	7080	It's all over.
7080	11240	120 years of science has suddenly been proved wrong.
11240	14280	The news has been copied and pasted round the blogosphere,
14280	17400	and of course repeated on What's Up With That.
17400	22560	But before we start putting out the bunting, let's just check where this claim comes from.
22560	28160	It's from… James Delingpole, writing in Breitbart News.
28320	31520	Delingpole has a history of getting his science wrong,
31520	36520	so it pays to be sceptical and check the information, doesn't it?
36520	41520	Especially since Delingpole said he doesn't read scientific papers.
58160	66160	So whose work did Delingpole interpret?
66160	70520	He says the list comes from a blogger who goes under the name of Kenneth Richard,
70520	77160	writing in No Tricks Zone, and his description of what the papers say is a little more nuanced.
77160	81160	400 scientific papers have been published that cast doubt on the position
81160	86560	that anthropogenic CO2 emissions function as the climate's fundamental control knob.
86560	89360	But we all get what No Tricks Zone is driving at.
89360	96840	The 400 papers cast doubt on the conclusion that CO2 is a major driver of long-term climate change.
96840	103320	So let's check the papers and find out if they really do say that, or that global warming is a myth.
103320	108880	Let's look at the papers Delingpole found most convincing, the ones he put right up front.
108880	112080	The first one is easy before we even check it.
112080	116560	It's been widely suggested from both climate modelling and observation data
116560	121880	that solar activity plays a key role in driving late Holocene climatic fluctuations
121880	126880	by triggering global temperature variability and atmospheric dynamic circulation.
126880	129440	The key word here is late Holocene.
129440	134760	So we're not talking about the current period of warming that's got everyone so concerned.
134760	137720	The time period is spelled out in the abstract.
137720	142880	We suggest that solar activity may play a key role in driving the climatic fluctuations
142880	147080	in northern China during the last 22 centuries.
147080	150000	Still, that is an amazing discovery, right?
150000	154040	The Sun may have played a key role in driving climate.
154040	155320	Well, not really.
155320	160000	This observation was so underwhelming it wasn't even mentioned in the title.
160000	165160	The fact that the Sun has had a strong influence on climate change over the last 2,000 years,
165160	169600	in fact, the last 11,000 years, that's been known for some time.
169600	172200	I've covered this in my climate change series.
172200	173640	And the reason is simple.
173640	179480	For the last 11,000 years, carbon dioxide concentration has been pretty much stable,
179480	183000	between 250 and 280 parts per million.
183000	189320	So carbon dioxide obviously hasn't had much of an effect on global temperature during that time.
189320	195120	To use an analogy, CO2 and solar activity are like two heaters heating up a room.
195120	201520	When the CO2 heater remains stable and the Sun heater is turned up, the room warms up.
201520	208600	If the Sun heater remains stable and the CO2 heater is turned up, that also causes the room to warm up.
208600	212960	So it's not surprising, as shown in this and other papers on the list,
212960	216920	that since CO2 has been stable for the last 11,000 years,
216920	221520	it's other factors like the Sun, volcanic eruptions, ocean cycles and so on
221520	223840	that have determined the short-term climate,
223840	227240	and solar fluctuations have determined the long-term climate.
227240	231240	None of that contradicts the fact that when CO2 levels rise,
231240	234760	as they have been doing very steeply over the last half century,
234760	237640	the temperature also rises steeply.
237640	243120	In other words, after 11,000 years of dormancy, we've turned the CO2 heater back on,
243120	245000	at a very high setting,
245000	248320	while the Sun heater has been turned down a bit.
248360	251840	And the result is that the room is warming up pretty fast.
251840	254960	The next paper simply emphasises that point.
254960	260480	Periods with few sunspots are associated with low solar activity and cold climate periods.
260480	266720	Periods with many sunspots are associated with high solar activity and warm climate periods.
266720	272920	And that may well be true for most of the period the paper was looking at, when CO2 levels were stable.
272920	277480	But over the last 40 years, we've seen a downward trend in sunspot numbers
277480	280320	that is not associated with a cooling period,
280320	283680	it's been associated with a very strong warming period,
283680	288280	which confirms the conclusion that the CO2 heater is back on.
288280	292520	So that doesn't debunk the theory that CO2 is a major driver of climate,
292520	294880	it's quite consistent with it.
294880	298560	I'm going to come back to the next paper in a minute, but you get the point.
298560	304560	The highlighted papers here are just looking at past warming, when CO2 levels were stable.
304560	307800	You can check the rest of the list yourself, it's not hard.
307800	311520	Sometimes you don't need to go any further than Delingpole's summary.
311520	315600	Modern climate in phase with natural variability, he says.
315600	320800	But the two papers Delingpole highlights are looking specifically at precipitation,
320800	324160	not climate as a whole, let alone temperature.
324160	328680	And they're not looking at the world, they're looking at Tibet and Northwest Australia.
328680	333280	Neither of them is saying or even suggesting that current global temperature
333280	336120	is in phase with natural variability.
336120	342840	Their research is perfectly consistent with temperatures being in phase with a steep rise in CO2 levels.
342840	347120	Climate influenced by natural oscillation, like El Niño and La Niña,
347120	350000	yeah sure, no one disputes that.
350000	354800	During a period of La Niña, the Pacific Ocean sucks in heat from the atmosphere,
354800	358240	and during El Niño it spits it back out.
358240	363040	But these are short-term redistributions of heat cycling over a few years,
363040	370200	no one's suggesting in any of the papers that this means CO2 is not a major driver of global temperature.
370200	373280	As we go down the list, the papers get more bizarre.
373280	378120	There are papers on how wind farms may pose a threat to bats and vultures,
378120	380880	and how wind farm blades are being wasted.
380880	384160	I'm struggling to see how any of this has to do with these papers
384160	389560	casting doubt on carbon dioxide's role in global warming.
389560	394600	I said I'd come back to this paper which, like the others, is looking at past climate,
394600	399760	when CO2 levels were stable and had little or no effect on changing temperature.
399760	403440	And like the others, this paper's findings are perfectly consistent
403440	406560	with CO2 as a major driver of climate change.
406560	410960	But it goes further, and specifically endorses the conclusion
411000	414600	that man-made forces are affecting global temperature.
414600	416880	That's what anthropogenic means.
416880	422760	And that's totally contrary to what Delingpole and No Tricks Zone claim it says.
422760	428400	Now that could be regarded as a slip, if it was the only paper on the list that did that.
428400	429760	But it's not.
429760	432840	One of my subscribers cited several other papers on the list
432840	436960	that also endorsed the strong link between CO2 and temperature.
436960	439520	I checked, and he's right.
439520	442480	One of the papers is by Abrantes et al.
442480	445200	No Tricks Zone points out that the paper says,
452960	457760	OK, no surprise, the sun influences global temperature, as everyone knows.
457760	462360	But what No Tricks Zone didn't tell you is that the paper also says,
470520	473040	It's right there in the introduction,
473040	478640	totally contradicting the claim that the paper cast doubt on CO2-induced warming.
478640	483040	And this paper by Williams et al. also on the list concludes,
483040	487520	increasing anthropogenic emissions of greenhouse gases to the atmosphere
487520	490520	characterise the period with best data coverage,
490520	497120	and global temperature during this period are exceeding the estimates of natural variability.
497120	500960	Here's another one on the list, which says that forcing due to solar cycles
500960	506360	is much smaller than forcing due to anthropogenic increases in greenhouse gases.
506360	511960	And this one, also on the list, says that anthropogenic impact due to the burning of fossil fuels
511960	516520	is the most important driver of climate warming in the 20th century.
516520	520400	And this one, also on the list, says that a recent warming signal
520400	523320	may not be the result of a natural modulation,
523320	526680	but the result of an increase in greenhouse gases.
526680	530160	So while No Tricks Zone, Delingpole and What's Up With That
530160	533960	all claim these papers debunk warming caused by CO2,
533960	537240	in fact they do the opposite, they endorse it.
537240	540560	While other papers on the list are completely consistent with,
540600	543920	or unrelated to, global warming theory,
543920	548800	and I haven't even got around to whether they were published in respected scientific journals,
548800	551680	a lot of them aren't.
551680	556840	Anthony Watts at What's Up With That was so taken in by the claims of No Tricks Zone
556840	560240	that he never bothered checking any of the 400 papers,
560240	565520	he simply rushed in a headline that claimed climate change had been debunked.
565520	568920	Delingpole genuinely thought the spurious list would cause
568920	573960	misery and consternation and horror among those who accept the science.
573960	579280	Instead, after a very easy fact check, it simply causes laughter and derision,
579280	584520	and a world-weary sigh that this amateur stuff is still going on,
584520	589000	and is still believed by so many people who don't bother to check it.
