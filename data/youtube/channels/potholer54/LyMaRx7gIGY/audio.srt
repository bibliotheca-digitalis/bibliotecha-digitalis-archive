1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,840
Global warming is a myth, according to 400 scientific papers published this year.

2
00:00:05,840 --> 00:00:07,080
It's all over.

3
00:00:07,080 --> 00:00:11,240
120 years of science has suddenly been proved wrong.

4
00:00:11,240 --> 00:00:14,280
The news has been copied and pasted round the blogosphere,

5
00:00:14,280 --> 00:00:17,400
and of course repeated on What's Up With That.

6
00:00:17,400 --> 00:00:22,560
But before we start putting out the bunting, let's just check where this claim comes from.

7
00:00:22,560 --> 00:00:28,160
It's from… James Delingpole, writing in Breitbart News.

8
00:00:28,320 --> 00:00:31,520
Delingpole has a history of getting his science wrong,

9
00:00:31,520 --> 00:00:36,520
so it pays to be sceptical and check the information, doesn't it?

10
00:00:36,520 --> 00:00:41,520
Especially since Delingpole said he doesn't read scientific papers.

11
00:00:58,160 --> 00:01:06,160
So whose work did Delingpole interpret?

12
00:01:06,160 --> 00:01:10,520
He says the list comes from a blogger who goes under the name of Kenneth Richard,

13
00:01:10,520 --> 00:01:17,160
writing in No Tricks Zone, and his description of what the papers say is a little more nuanced.

14
00:01:17,160 --> 00:01:21,160
400 scientific papers have been published that cast doubt on the position

15
00:01:21,160 --> 00:01:26,560
that anthropogenic CO2 emissions function as the climate's fundamental control knob.

16
00:01:26,560 --> 00:01:29,360
But we all get what No Tricks Zone is driving at.

17
00:01:29,360 --> 00:01:36,840
The 400 papers cast doubt on the conclusion that CO2 is a major driver of long-term climate change.

18
00:01:36,840 --> 00:01:43,320
So let's check the papers and find out if they really do say that, or that global warming is a myth.

19
00:01:43,320 --> 00:01:48,880
Let's look at the papers Delingpole found most convincing, the ones he put right up front.

20
00:01:48,880 --> 00:01:52,080
The first one is easy before we even check it.

21
00:01:52,080 --> 00:01:56,560
It's been widely suggested from both climate modelling and observation data

22
00:01:56,560 --> 00:02:01,880
that solar activity plays a key role in driving late Holocene climatic fluctuations

23
00:02:01,880 --> 00:02:06,880
by triggering global temperature variability and atmospheric dynamic circulation.

24
00:02:06,880 --> 00:02:09,440
The key word here is late Holocene.

25
00:02:09,440 --> 00:02:14,760
So we're not talking about the current period of warming that's got everyone so concerned.

26
00:02:14,760 --> 00:02:17,720
The time period is spelled out in the abstract.

27
00:02:17,720 --> 00:02:22,880
We suggest that solar activity may play a key role in driving the climatic fluctuations

28
00:02:22,880 --> 00:02:27,080
in northern China during the last 22 centuries.

29
00:02:27,080 --> 00:02:30,000
Still, that is an amazing discovery, right?

30
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:34,040
The Sun may have played a key role in driving climate.

31
00:02:34,040 --> 00:02:35,320
Well, not really.

32
00:02:35,320 --> 00:02:40,000
This observation was so underwhelming it wasn't even mentioned in the title.

33
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:45,160
The fact that the Sun has had a strong influence on climate change over the last 2,000 years,

34
00:02:45,160 --> 00:02:49,600
in fact, the last 11,000 years, that's been known for some time.

35
00:02:49,600 --> 00:02:52,200
I've covered this in my climate change series.

36
00:02:52,200 --> 00:02:53,640
And the reason is simple.

37
00:02:53,640 --> 00:02:59,480
For the last 11,000 years, carbon dioxide concentration has been pretty much stable,

38
00:02:59,480 --> 00:03:03,000
between 250 and 280 parts per million.

39
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:09,320
So carbon dioxide obviously hasn't had much of an effect on global temperature during that time.

40
00:03:09,320 --> 00:03:15,120
To use an analogy, CO2 and solar activity are like two heaters heating up a room.

41
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:21,520
When the CO2 heater remains stable and the Sun heater is turned up, the room warms up.

42
00:03:21,520 --> 00:03:28,600
If the Sun heater remains stable and the CO2 heater is turned up, that also causes the room to warm up.

43
00:03:28,600 --> 00:03:32,960
So it's not surprising, as shown in this and other papers on the list,

44
00:03:32,960 --> 00:03:36,920
that since CO2 has been stable for the last 11,000 years,

45
00:03:36,920 --> 00:03:41,520
it's other factors like the Sun, volcanic eruptions, ocean cycles and so on

46
00:03:41,520 --> 00:03:43,840
that have determined the short-term climate,

47
00:03:43,840 --> 00:03:47,240
and solar fluctuations have determined the long-term climate.

48
00:03:47,240 --> 00:03:51,240
None of that contradicts the fact that when CO2 levels rise,

49
00:03:51,240 --> 00:03:54,760
as they have been doing very steeply over the last half century,

50
00:03:54,760 --> 00:03:57,640
the temperature also rises steeply.

51
00:03:57,640 --> 00:04:03,120
In other words, after 11,000 years of dormancy, we've turned the CO2 heater back on,

52
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:05,000
at a very high setting,

53
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:08,320
while the Sun heater has been turned down a bit.

54
00:04:08,360 --> 00:04:11,840
And the result is that the room is warming up pretty fast.

55
00:04:11,840 --> 00:04:14,960
The next paper simply emphasises that point.

56
00:04:14,960 --> 00:04:20,480
Periods with few sunspots are associated with low solar activity and cold climate periods.

57
00:04:20,480 --> 00:04:26,720
Periods with many sunspots are associated with high solar activity and warm climate periods.

58
00:04:26,720 --> 00:04:32,920
And that may well be true for most of the period the paper was looking at, when CO2 levels were stable.

59
00:04:32,920 --> 00:04:37,480
But over the last 40 years, we've seen a downward trend in sunspot numbers

60
00:04:37,480 --> 00:04:40,320
that is not associated with a cooling period,

61
00:04:40,320 --> 00:04:43,680
it's been associated with a very strong warming period,

62
00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:48,280
which confirms the conclusion that the CO2 heater is back on.

63
00:04:48,280 --> 00:04:52,520
So that doesn't debunk the theory that CO2 is a major driver of climate,

64
00:04:52,520 --> 00:04:54,880
it's quite consistent with it.

65
00:04:54,880 --> 00:04:58,560
I'm going to come back to the next paper in a minute, but you get the point.

66
00:04:58,560 --> 00:05:04,560
The highlighted papers here are just looking at past warming, when CO2 levels were stable.

67
00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:07,800
You can check the rest of the list yourself, it's not hard.

68
00:05:07,800 --> 00:05:11,520
Sometimes you don't need to go any further than Delingpole's summary.

69
00:05:11,520 --> 00:05:15,600
Modern climate in phase with natural variability, he says.

70
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:20,800
But the two papers Delingpole highlights are looking specifically at precipitation,

71
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:24,160
not climate as a whole, let alone temperature.

72
00:05:24,160 --> 00:05:28,680
And they're not looking at the world, they're looking at Tibet and Northwest Australia.

73
00:05:28,680 --> 00:05:33,280
Neither of them is saying or even suggesting that current global temperature

74
00:05:33,280 --> 00:05:36,120
is in phase with natural variability.

75
00:05:36,120 --> 00:05:42,840
Their research is perfectly consistent with temperatures being in phase with a steep rise in CO2 levels.

76
00:05:42,840 --> 00:05:47,120
Climate influenced by natural oscillation, like El Niño and La Niña,

77
00:05:47,120 --> 00:05:50,000
yeah sure, no one disputes that.

78
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:54,800
During a period of La Niña, the Pacific Ocean sucks in heat from the atmosphere,

79
00:05:54,800 --> 00:05:58,240
and during El Niño it spits it back out.

80
00:05:58,240 --> 00:06:03,040
But these are short-term redistributions of heat cycling over a few years,

81
00:06:03,040 --> 00:06:10,200
no one's suggesting in any of the papers that this means CO2 is not a major driver of global temperature.

82
00:06:10,200 --> 00:06:13,280
As we go down the list, the papers get more bizarre.

83
00:06:13,280 --> 00:06:18,120
There are papers on how wind farms may pose a threat to bats and vultures,

84
00:06:18,120 --> 00:06:20,880
and how wind farm blades are being wasted.

85
00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:24,160
I'm struggling to see how any of this has to do with these papers

86
00:06:24,160 --> 00:06:29,560
casting doubt on carbon dioxide's role in global warming.

87
00:06:29,560 --> 00:06:34,600
I said I'd come back to this paper which, like the others, is looking at past climate,

88
00:06:34,600 --> 00:06:39,760
when CO2 levels were stable and had little or no effect on changing temperature.

89
00:06:39,760 --> 00:06:43,440
And like the others, this paper's findings are perfectly consistent

90
00:06:43,440 --> 00:06:46,560
with CO2 as a major driver of climate change.

91
00:06:46,560 --> 00:06:50,960
But it goes further, and specifically endorses the conclusion

92
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:54,600
that man-made forces are affecting global temperature.

93
00:06:54,600 --> 00:06:56,880
That's what anthropogenic means.

94
00:06:56,880 --> 00:07:02,760
And that's totally contrary to what Delingpole and No Tricks Zone claim it says.

95
00:07:02,760 --> 00:07:08,400
Now that could be regarded as a slip, if it was the only paper on the list that did that.

96
00:07:08,400 --> 00:07:09,760
But it's not.

97
00:07:09,760 --> 00:07:12,840
One of my subscribers cited several other papers on the list

98
00:07:12,840 --> 00:07:16,960
that also endorsed the strong link between CO2 and temperature.

99
00:07:16,960 --> 00:07:19,520
I checked, and he's right.

100
00:07:19,520 --> 00:07:22,480
One of the papers is by Abrantes et al.

101
00:07:22,480 --> 00:07:25,200
No Tricks Zone points out that the paper says,

102
00:07:32,960 --> 00:07:37,760
OK, no surprise, the sun influences global temperature, as everyone knows.

103
00:07:37,760 --> 00:07:42,360
But what No Tricks Zone didn't tell you is that the paper also says,

104
00:07:50,520 --> 00:07:53,040
It's right there in the introduction,

105
00:07:53,040 --> 00:07:58,640
totally contradicting the claim that the paper cast doubt on CO2-induced warming.

106
00:07:58,640 --> 00:08:03,040
And this paper by Williams et al. also on the list concludes,

107
00:08:03,040 --> 00:08:07,520
increasing anthropogenic emissions of greenhouse gases to the atmosphere

108
00:08:07,520 --> 00:08:10,520
characterise the period with best data coverage,

109
00:08:10,520 --> 00:08:17,120
and global temperature during this period are exceeding the estimates of natural variability.

110
00:08:17,120 --> 00:08:20,960
Here's another one on the list, which says that forcing due to solar cycles

111
00:08:20,960 --> 00:08:26,360
is much smaller than forcing due to anthropogenic increases in greenhouse gases.

112
00:08:26,360 --> 00:08:31,960
And this one, also on the list, says that anthropogenic impact due to the burning of fossil fuels

113
00:08:31,960 --> 00:08:36,520
is the most important driver of climate warming in the 20th century.

114
00:08:36,520 --> 00:08:40,400
And this one, also on the list, says that a recent warming signal

115
00:08:40,400 --> 00:08:43,320
may not be the result of a natural modulation,

116
00:08:43,320 --> 00:08:46,680
but the result of an increase in greenhouse gases.

117
00:08:46,680 --> 00:08:50,160
So while No Tricks Zone, Delingpole and What's Up With That

118
00:08:50,160 --> 00:08:53,960
all claim these papers debunk warming caused by CO2,

119
00:08:53,960 --> 00:08:57,240
in fact they do the opposite, they endorse it.

120
00:08:57,240 --> 00:09:00,560
While other papers on the list are completely consistent with,

121
00:09:00,600 --> 00:09:03,920
or unrelated to, global warming theory,

122
00:09:03,920 --> 00:09:08,800
and I haven't even got around to whether they were published in respected scientific journals,

123
00:09:08,800 --> 00:09:11,680
a lot of them aren't.

124
00:09:11,680 --> 00:09:16,840
Anthony Watts at What's Up With That was so taken in by the claims of No Tricks Zone

125
00:09:16,840 --> 00:09:20,240
that he never bothered checking any of the 400 papers,

126
00:09:20,240 --> 00:09:25,520
he simply rushed in a headline that claimed climate change had been debunked.

127
00:09:25,520 --> 00:09:28,920
Delingpole genuinely thought the spurious list would cause

128
00:09:28,920 --> 00:09:33,960
misery and consternation and horror among those who accept the science.

129
00:09:33,960 --> 00:09:39,280
Instead, after a very easy fact check, it simply causes laughter and derision,

130
00:09:39,280 --> 00:09:44,520
and a world-weary sigh that this amateur stuff is still going on,

131
00:09:44,520 --> 00:09:49,000
and is still believed by so many people who don't bother to check it.

132
00:09:58,920 --> 00:10:01,000
you
