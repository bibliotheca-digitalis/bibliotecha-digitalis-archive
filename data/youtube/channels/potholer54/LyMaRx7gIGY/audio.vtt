00:00.000 --> 00:05.840
Global warming is a myth, according to 400 scientific papers published this year.

00:05.840 --> 00:07.080
It's all over.

00:07.080 --> 00:11.240
120 years of science has suddenly been proved wrong.

00:11.240 --> 00:14.280
The news has been copied and pasted round the blogosphere,

00:14.280 --> 00:17.400
and of course repeated on What's Up With That.

00:17.400 --> 00:22.560
But before we start putting out the bunting, let's just check where this claim comes from.

00:22.560 --> 00:28.160
It's from… James Delingpole, writing in Breitbart News.

00:28.320 --> 00:31.520
Delingpole has a history of getting his science wrong,

00:31.520 --> 00:36.520
so it pays to be sceptical and check the information, doesn't it?

00:36.520 --> 00:41.520
Especially since Delingpole said he doesn't read scientific papers.

00:58.160 --> 01:06.160
So whose work did Delingpole interpret?

01:06.160 --> 01:10.520
He says the list comes from a blogger who goes under the name of Kenneth Richard,

01:10.520 --> 01:17.160
writing in No Tricks Zone, and his description of what the papers say is a little more nuanced.

01:17.160 --> 01:21.160
400 scientific papers have been published that cast doubt on the position

01:21.160 --> 01:26.560
that anthropogenic CO2 emissions function as the climate's fundamental control knob.

01:26.560 --> 01:29.360
But we all get what No Tricks Zone is driving at.

01:29.360 --> 01:36.840
The 400 papers cast doubt on the conclusion that CO2 is a major driver of long-term climate change.

01:36.840 --> 01:43.320
So let's check the papers and find out if they really do say that, or that global warming is a myth.

01:43.320 --> 01:48.880
Let's look at the papers Delingpole found most convincing, the ones he put right up front.

01:48.880 --> 01:52.080
The first one is easy before we even check it.

01:52.080 --> 01:56.560
It's been widely suggested from both climate modelling and observation data

01:56.560 --> 02:01.880
that solar activity plays a key role in driving late Holocene climatic fluctuations

02:01.880 --> 02:06.880
by triggering global temperature variability and atmospheric dynamic circulation.

02:06.880 --> 02:09.440
The key word here is late Holocene.

02:09.440 --> 02:14.760
So we're not talking about the current period of warming that's got everyone so concerned.

02:14.760 --> 02:17.720
The time period is spelled out in the abstract.

02:17.720 --> 02:22.880
We suggest that solar activity may play a key role in driving the climatic fluctuations

02:22.880 --> 02:27.080
in northern China during the last 22 centuries.

02:27.080 --> 02:30.000
Still, that is an amazing discovery, right?

02:30.000 --> 02:34.040
The Sun may have played a key role in driving climate.

02:34.040 --> 02:35.320
Well, not really.

02:35.320 --> 02:40.000
This observation was so underwhelming it wasn't even mentioned in the title.

02:40.000 --> 02:45.160
The fact that the Sun has had a strong influence on climate change over the last 2,000 years,

02:45.160 --> 02:49.600
in fact, the last 11,000 years, that's been known for some time.

02:49.600 --> 02:52.200
I've covered this in my climate change series.

02:52.200 --> 02:53.640
And the reason is simple.

02:53.640 --> 02:59.480
For the last 11,000 years, carbon dioxide concentration has been pretty much stable,

02:59.480 --> 03:03.000
between 250 and 280 parts per million.

03:03.000 --> 03:09.320
So carbon dioxide obviously hasn't had much of an effect on global temperature during that time.

03:09.320 --> 03:15.120
To use an analogy, CO2 and solar activity are like two heaters heating up a room.

03:15.120 --> 03:21.520
When the CO2 heater remains stable and the Sun heater is turned up, the room warms up.

03:21.520 --> 03:28.600
If the Sun heater remains stable and the CO2 heater is turned up, that also causes the room to warm up.

03:28.600 --> 03:32.960
So it's not surprising, as shown in this and other papers on the list,

03:32.960 --> 03:36.920
that since CO2 has been stable for the last 11,000 years,

03:36.920 --> 03:41.520
it's other factors like the Sun, volcanic eruptions, ocean cycles and so on

03:41.520 --> 03:43.840
that have determined the short-term climate,

03:43.840 --> 03:47.240
and solar fluctuations have determined the long-term climate.

03:47.240 --> 03:51.240
None of that contradicts the fact that when CO2 levels rise,

03:51.240 --> 03:54.760
as they have been doing very steeply over the last half century,

03:54.760 --> 03:57.640
the temperature also rises steeply.

03:57.640 --> 04:03.120
In other words, after 11,000 years of dormancy, we've turned the CO2 heater back on,

04:03.120 --> 04:05.000
at a very high setting,

04:05.000 --> 04:08.320
while the Sun heater has been turned down a bit.

04:08.360 --> 04:11.840
And the result is that the room is warming up pretty fast.

04:11.840 --> 04:14.960
The next paper simply emphasises that point.

04:14.960 --> 04:20.480
Periods with few sunspots are associated with low solar activity and cold climate periods.

04:20.480 --> 04:26.720
Periods with many sunspots are associated with high solar activity and warm climate periods.

04:26.720 --> 04:32.920
And that may well be true for most of the period the paper was looking at, when CO2 levels were stable.

04:32.920 --> 04:37.480
But over the last 40 years, we've seen a downward trend in sunspot numbers

04:37.480 --> 04:40.320
that is not associated with a cooling period,

04:40.320 --> 04:43.680
it's been associated with a very strong warming period,

04:43.680 --> 04:48.280
which confirms the conclusion that the CO2 heater is back on.

04:48.280 --> 04:52.520
So that doesn't debunk the theory that CO2 is a major driver of climate,

04:52.520 --> 04:54.880
it's quite consistent with it.

04:54.880 --> 04:58.560
I'm going to come back to the next paper in a minute, but you get the point.

04:58.560 --> 05:04.560
The highlighted papers here are just looking at past warming, when CO2 levels were stable.

05:04.560 --> 05:07.800
You can check the rest of the list yourself, it's not hard.

05:07.800 --> 05:11.520
Sometimes you don't need to go any further than Delingpole's summary.

05:11.520 --> 05:15.600
Modern climate in phase with natural variability, he says.

05:15.600 --> 05:20.800
But the two papers Delingpole highlights are looking specifically at precipitation,

05:20.800 --> 05:24.160
not climate as a whole, let alone temperature.

05:24.160 --> 05:28.680
And they're not looking at the world, they're looking at Tibet and Northwest Australia.

05:28.680 --> 05:33.280
Neither of them is saying or even suggesting that current global temperature

05:33.280 --> 05:36.120
is in phase with natural variability.

05:36.120 --> 05:42.840
Their research is perfectly consistent with temperatures being in phase with a steep rise in CO2 levels.

05:42.840 --> 05:47.120
Climate influenced by natural oscillation, like El Niño and La Niña,

05:47.120 --> 05:50.000
yeah sure, no one disputes that.

05:50.000 --> 05:54.800
During a period of La Niña, the Pacific Ocean sucks in heat from the atmosphere,

05:54.800 --> 05:58.240
and during El Niño it spits it back out.

05:58.240 --> 06:03.040
But these are short-term redistributions of heat cycling over a few years,

06:03.040 --> 06:10.200
no one's suggesting in any of the papers that this means CO2 is not a major driver of global temperature.

06:10.200 --> 06:13.280
As we go down the list, the papers get more bizarre.

06:13.280 --> 06:18.120
There are papers on how wind farms may pose a threat to bats and vultures,

06:18.120 --> 06:20.880
and how wind farm blades are being wasted.

06:20.880 --> 06:24.160
I'm struggling to see how any of this has to do with these papers

06:24.160 --> 06:29.560
casting doubt on carbon dioxide's role in global warming.

06:29.560 --> 06:34.600
I said I'd come back to this paper which, like the others, is looking at past climate,

06:34.600 --> 06:39.760
when CO2 levels were stable and had little or no effect on changing temperature.

06:39.760 --> 06:43.440
And like the others, this paper's findings are perfectly consistent

06:43.440 --> 06:46.560
with CO2 as a major driver of climate change.

06:46.560 --> 06:50.960
But it goes further, and specifically endorses the conclusion

06:51.000 --> 06:54.600
that man-made forces are affecting global temperature.

06:54.600 --> 06:56.880
That's what anthropogenic means.

06:56.880 --> 07:02.760
And that's totally contrary to what Delingpole and No Tricks Zone claim it says.

07:02.760 --> 07:08.400
Now that could be regarded as a slip, if it was the only paper on the list that did that.

07:08.400 --> 07:09.760
But it's not.

07:09.760 --> 07:12.840
One of my subscribers cited several other papers on the list

07:12.840 --> 07:16.960
that also endorsed the strong link between CO2 and temperature.

07:16.960 --> 07:19.520
I checked, and he's right.

07:19.520 --> 07:22.480
One of the papers is by Abrantes et al.

07:22.480 --> 07:25.200
No Tricks Zone points out that the paper says,

07:32.960 --> 07:37.760
OK, no surprise, the sun influences global temperature, as everyone knows.

07:37.760 --> 07:42.360
But what No Tricks Zone didn't tell you is that the paper also says,

07:50.520 --> 07:53.040
It's right there in the introduction,

07:53.040 --> 07:58.640
totally contradicting the claim that the paper cast doubt on CO2-induced warming.

07:58.640 --> 08:03.040
And this paper by Williams et al. also on the list concludes,

08:03.040 --> 08:07.520
increasing anthropogenic emissions of greenhouse gases to the atmosphere

08:07.520 --> 08:10.520
characterise the period with best data coverage,

08:10.520 --> 08:17.120
and global temperature during this period are exceeding the estimates of natural variability.

08:17.120 --> 08:20.960
Here's another one on the list, which says that forcing due to solar cycles

08:20.960 --> 08:26.360
is much smaller than forcing due to anthropogenic increases in greenhouse gases.

08:26.360 --> 08:31.960
And this one, also on the list, says that anthropogenic impact due to the burning of fossil fuels

08:31.960 --> 08:36.520
is the most important driver of climate warming in the 20th century.

08:36.520 --> 08:40.400
And this one, also on the list, says that a recent warming signal

08:40.400 --> 08:43.320
may not be the result of a natural modulation,

08:43.320 --> 08:46.680
but the result of an increase in greenhouse gases.

08:46.680 --> 08:50.160
So while No Tricks Zone, Delingpole and What's Up With That

08:50.160 --> 08:53.960
all claim these papers debunk warming caused by CO2,

08:53.960 --> 08:57.240
in fact they do the opposite, they endorse it.

08:57.240 --> 09:00.560
While other papers on the list are completely consistent with,

09:00.600 --> 09:03.920
or unrelated to, global warming theory,

09:03.920 --> 09:08.800
and I haven't even got around to whether they were published in respected scientific journals,

09:08.800 --> 09:11.680
a lot of them aren't.

09:11.680 --> 09:16.840
Anthony Watts at What's Up With That was so taken in by the claims of No Tricks Zone

09:16.840 --> 09:20.240
that he never bothered checking any of the 400 papers,

09:20.240 --> 09:25.520
he simply rushed in a headline that claimed climate change had been debunked.

09:25.520 --> 09:28.920
Delingpole genuinely thought the spurious list would cause

09:28.920 --> 09:33.960
misery and consternation and horror among those who accept the science.

09:33.960 --> 09:39.280
Instead, after a very easy fact check, it simply causes laughter and derision,

09:39.280 --> 09:44.520
and a world-weary sigh that this amateur stuff is still going on,

09:44.520 --> 09:49.000
and is still believed by so many people who don't bother to check it.

09:58.920 --> 10:01.000
