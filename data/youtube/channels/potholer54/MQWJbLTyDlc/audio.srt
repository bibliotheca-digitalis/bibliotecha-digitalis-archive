1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,180
I'm making this video because, as a former geologist turned science journalist, when

2
00:00:05,180 --> 00:00:09,580
I've tried to explain the Earth's history during discussions on my channel, people seem

3
00:00:09,580 --> 00:00:14,620
to be very confused about time scales and how all this happened.

4
00:00:14,620 --> 00:00:19,580
So in this video I'm going to show some basic geological principles and how they relate

5
00:00:19,580 --> 00:00:22,780
to the Earth's journey through the last billion years.

6
00:00:22,780 --> 00:00:27,420
I'll answer questions like why is there so much oil in the Middle East?

7
00:00:27,420 --> 00:00:30,880
How did geology help in the hunt for Osama bin Laden?

8
00:00:30,880 --> 00:00:33,900
How does the Ice Age fit into the Earth's history?

9
00:00:33,900 --> 00:00:39,980
What causes changes in climate and are there any cycles and patterns in all this?

10
00:00:39,980 --> 00:00:45,540
Let's first travel back through time to our starting point about a billion years ago.

11
00:00:45,540 --> 00:00:50,380
The Earth is a lot older than that and we can find rocks going back over three billion

12
00:00:50,380 --> 00:00:55,500
years, but a billion years ago is when things start getting interesting.

13
00:00:55,500 --> 00:01:00,300
We'll call this dawn, five o'clock in the morning, and end our journey at one o'clock

14
00:01:00,300 --> 00:01:03,540
in the afternoon, the present time.

15
00:01:03,540 --> 00:01:07,700
Then we'll go forward in time and see what will happen to the Earth 250 million years

16
00:01:07,700 --> 00:01:09,700
into the future.

17
00:01:09,700 --> 00:01:14,020
So each minute will represent about two million years.

18
00:01:14,020 --> 00:01:18,460
By the time we get to our starting point, the Earth's protocontinents have already been

19
00:01:18,460 --> 00:01:23,300
moving around for hundreds of millions of years, and a billion years ago most of them

20
00:01:23,300 --> 00:01:27,220
were joined into one supercontinent called Rodinia.

21
00:01:27,220 --> 00:01:31,820
The Earth's crust may be solid, but on a large scale it's very flexible.

22
00:01:31,820 --> 00:01:37,180
It's made of a number of plates, driven around by currents of molten rock in the upper mantle.

23
00:01:37,180 --> 00:01:41,700
Where thinner and denser oceanic plates made of basalt were driven against thicker and

24
00:01:41,700 --> 00:01:47,220
lighter continental plates made of granite, the denser plate got subducted.

25
00:01:47,220 --> 00:01:51,340
When that happened, the edge of the continent buckled and molten rock from the descending

26
00:01:51,340 --> 00:01:55,220
crust rose to form volcanic mountain chains.

27
00:01:55,220 --> 00:01:59,660
When the subducting oceanic crust ran out, the continents themselves would collide and

28
00:01:59,660 --> 00:02:03,220
fuse, throwing up mountain chains.

29
00:02:03,220 --> 00:02:07,860
Basalt and granite fit within one of three rock classifications, igneous rocks, in other

30
00:02:07,860 --> 00:02:11,740
words molten rock that's cooled and solidified.

31
00:02:11,740 --> 00:02:16,360
Where it cools slowly, the crystals have time to gravitate together, forming large-grained

32
00:02:16,360 --> 00:02:18,340
rocks like granite.

33
00:02:18,340 --> 00:02:23,320
Where the rock is cooled quickly, the crystals don't have time to grow so they're quite small,

34
00:02:23,320 --> 00:02:25,820
forming fine-grained rocks like basalt.

35
00:02:25,820 --> 00:02:30,340
A good rule of thumb is that the larger the grain size, the deeper underground and igneous

36
00:02:30,340 --> 00:02:32,420
rock has formed.

37
00:02:32,420 --> 00:02:35,640
Rodonia lasted for over 300 million years.

38
00:02:35,640 --> 00:02:40,300
There was no life on land, just clusters of single-celled organisms building structures

39
00:02:40,300 --> 00:02:44,720
called stromatolites in shallow seas near the shoreline.

40
00:02:44,720 --> 00:02:50,580
About 750 million years ago, Rodonia began breaking apart.

41
00:02:50,580 --> 00:02:54,680
The sea that opened up between North America and Australia became a dumping ground for

42
00:02:54,680 --> 00:02:59,580
sediments that would later get uplifted by another tectonic collision forming most of

43
00:02:59,580 --> 00:03:03,760
western Canada and the northwestern United States.

44
00:03:03,760 --> 00:03:08,540
This brings us to our first geological principle – uplift and erosion.

45
00:03:08,540 --> 00:03:13,220
Land masses get lifted up through crustal movements, then eroded through processes like

46
00:03:13,220 --> 00:03:14,860
chemical weathering.

47
00:03:14,860 --> 00:03:19,480
This reacts carbon dioxide in the air with silicates in the rocks and the eroded material

48
00:03:19,480 --> 00:03:25,320
is washed out to sea to form calcium carbonates, the main ingredient of limestone.

49
00:03:25,320 --> 00:03:29,520
It's an important process for the climate because over time it sucks carbon dioxide

50
00:03:29,520 --> 00:03:31,100
out of the air.

51
00:03:31,100 --> 00:03:36,080
Some of this limestone gets dragged down through subduction and melts, pumping CO2 back into

52
00:03:36,080 --> 00:03:38,380
the air through volcanoes.

53
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:43,620
Fortunately for us, a lot of this carbon dioxide remains locked up in limestones today.

54
00:03:43,620 --> 00:03:48,720
There's also mechanical weathering which takes out large chunks of rock through processes

55
00:03:48,720 --> 00:03:55,640
like freeze and thaw or wind erosion and then grinds down the rock as it travels down rivers.

56
00:03:55,640 --> 00:04:00,420
The result is mud, silt, sand or pebbles according to grain size.

57
00:04:00,420 --> 00:04:05,440
These soft sediments build up around the continents, giving us our second principle of geology

58
00:04:05,440 --> 00:04:09,440
that older sediments tend to lie underneath younger ones.

59
00:04:09,440 --> 00:04:14,440
Hot water that ran through the sediments dissolved silica or calcium carbonate and then deposited

60
00:04:14,440 --> 00:04:18,240
it between grains, binding the grains together.

61
00:04:18,240 --> 00:04:22,860
Over millions of years this compression and cementation turned the sediments into solid

62
00:04:22,860 --> 00:04:27,480
rock like shales, siltstone, sandstone and limestone.

63
00:04:27,480 --> 00:04:30,520
These are known as sedimentary rocks.

64
00:04:30,520 --> 00:04:34,520
Look carefully and you can often detect the environment in which they formed.

65
00:04:34,520 --> 00:04:38,920
For example, cross-bedded sandstones show how ancient currents shifted.

66
00:04:38,920 --> 00:04:44,440
Bands of mud inside a sandstone may indicate the ebb and flow of a tidal estuary.

67
00:04:44,440 --> 00:04:48,800
Conglomerates formed from pebbles cemented together may indicate an ancient beach or

68
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:50,200
a riverbed.

69
00:04:50,200 --> 00:04:55,080
They look almost identical to pebbly beaches and riverbeds we see today.

70
00:04:55,080 --> 00:05:00,200
And this brings us to our third geological principle, the present is the key to the past.

71
00:05:00,200 --> 00:05:04,500
If the features we see in the rocks are identical to the features we see today, it's strong

72
00:05:04,500 --> 00:05:08,100
evidence that they were formed by the same processes.

73
00:05:08,100 --> 00:05:13,460
For example, when molten lava is cooled quickly, it forms round lumps called pillow lavas,

74
00:05:13,460 --> 00:05:17,500
identical to structures found in ancient basils.

75
00:05:17,500 --> 00:05:21,460
This principle was brought home to me about 40 years ago when I was working for a diamond

76
00:05:21,460 --> 00:05:24,020
exploration company in northwest Australia.

77
00:05:24,020 --> 00:05:26,900
Yes, this really is me.

78
00:05:26,900 --> 00:05:31,860
Our helicopter was coming down onto an area of rippling sand and I expected a cloud of

79
00:05:31,860 --> 00:05:35,620
dust to come up as we landed, but there was none.

80
00:05:35,620 --> 00:05:39,380
When I stepped onto the sand, it was rock hard.

81
00:05:39,380 --> 00:05:43,980
It turned out that the ripples had been formed when this sand was part of a shallow pre-Cambrian

82
00:05:43,980 --> 00:05:47,620
bay over a billion years ago.

83
00:05:47,620 --> 00:05:51,800
If layers of igneous and sedimentary rock were buried very deeply, the pressure and

84
00:05:51,800 --> 00:05:57,040
heat was so great that they changed into the third type of rock, metamorphic.

85
00:05:57,040 --> 00:06:02,800
Over time, limestone became marble, shale became slate, sandstone became quartzite,

86
00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:04,720
mudstone became schist.

87
00:06:04,720 --> 00:06:09,560
The more pressure and heat that was applied, the greater the metamorphosis.

88
00:06:09,560 --> 00:06:15,380
The heat comes from reservoirs of molten rock rising from the upper mantle, rich in minerals.

89
00:06:15,380 --> 00:06:21,200
This intruded into weak points, often powerful enough to deform the sedimentary layers above.

90
00:06:21,200 --> 00:06:26,040
When the magma cooled and cracked, hot water surged through it, depositing minerals like

91
00:06:26,040 --> 00:06:30,080
silica and metals like gold.

92
00:06:30,080 --> 00:06:34,200
Metamorphic and igneous rocks are still being formed today, but several kilometres under

93
00:06:34,200 --> 00:06:36,160
the surface of the earth.

94
00:06:36,160 --> 00:06:40,920
The only way we can see rocks like these is if they have been uplifted and then the strata

95
00:06:40,920 --> 00:06:43,880
on top of them eroded away.

96
00:06:43,880 --> 00:06:47,520
Uplift and erosion, which takes hundreds of millions of years.

97
00:06:47,520 --> 00:06:52,680
So metamorphic and mineral-rich igneous rocks are predominantly found in the remnants of

98
00:06:52,680 --> 00:06:57,440
the Precambrian, in ancient areas known as cratonic blocks or shields.

99
00:06:57,440 --> 00:07:02,400
They're not only the oldest and most stable parts of the crust, they're also the richest

100
00:07:02,400 --> 00:07:04,400
in minerals.

101
00:07:04,400 --> 00:07:08,440
For a long time there was a paradox in this Precambrian world.

102
00:07:08,440 --> 00:07:13,680
Just like a real dawn, the sun was much weaker back then, so weak that the earth should have

103
00:07:13,680 --> 00:07:16,880
frozen over, and yet it didn't.

104
00:07:16,880 --> 00:07:21,700
Geologists have concluded that what kept the earth warm was a high concentration of methane

105
00:07:21,740 --> 00:07:25,540
and carbon dioxide, strong greenhouse gases.

106
00:07:25,540 --> 00:07:31,420
As the concentration of these fell, exacerbated by other factors such as continental configuration,

107
00:07:31,420 --> 00:07:36,340
temperatures began to drop and the earth went into an ice age.

108
00:07:36,340 --> 00:07:40,740
Not this ice age, the one with mammoths and sabre-toothed tigers that began a mere two

109
00:07:40,740 --> 00:07:45,660
million years ago, we're talking about the mother of all ice ages that occurred over

110
00:07:45,660 --> 00:07:51,580
700 million years ago, when almost the entire surface of the earth froze over.

111
00:07:51,580 --> 00:07:56,060
And because ice has a high albedo, in other words it's very reflective, what little

112
00:07:56,060 --> 00:07:59,780
sunlight there was got reflected back into space.

113
00:07:59,780 --> 00:08:04,020
So the earth might have stayed frozen if it wasn't for one thing.

114
00:08:04,020 --> 00:08:08,800
Over a hundred million years, volcanoes under the ice continued pouring trillions of tonnes

115
00:08:08,800 --> 00:08:12,320
of carbon dioxide back into the atmosphere.

116
00:08:12,320 --> 00:08:16,740
This time there was no weathering process to wash it out, so the carbon dioxide kept

117
00:08:16,740 --> 00:08:21,620
accumulating until it reached levels 20 times higher than today.

118
00:08:21,620 --> 00:08:25,740
It acted like a blanket and trapped what little heat was coming in.

119
00:08:25,740 --> 00:08:31,860
That started to melt the ice, reducing the albedo and warmed the earth even further.

120
00:08:31,860 --> 00:08:36,860
Eventually the earth thawed out, and because CO2 levels were still very high, temperatures

121
00:08:36,860 --> 00:08:41,220
continued climbing until the earth became a hot house with average global temperature

122
00:08:41,220 --> 00:08:46,900
of around 70°F, about 13°C higher than today.

123
00:08:46,900 --> 00:08:49,660
Coral reefs grew near the North Pole.

124
00:08:49,660 --> 00:08:53,940
As we'll see throughout the earth's history, this link between carbon dioxide and global

125
00:08:53,940 --> 00:08:59,420
temperature is so crucial that carbon dioxide has been called the earth's thermostat.

126
00:08:59,420 --> 00:09:02,900
We're now in a period called the Cambrian.

127
00:09:02,900 --> 00:09:07,340
Most of the continents were once again bunched together into a supercontinent, this one's

128
00:09:07,340 --> 00:09:12,100
called Gondwanaland, although by the start of the Cambrian pieces of it had already begun

129
00:09:12,100 --> 00:09:13,660
to break away.

130
00:09:13,660 --> 00:09:19,060
An ancient ocean called the Iapetus was subducting under one of these pieces, the continent of

131
00:09:19,060 --> 00:09:20,740
Laurentia.

132
00:09:20,740 --> 00:09:26,160
Trillions of tonnes of sediment washed into the depression between the two crustal plates.

133
00:09:26,160 --> 00:09:31,340
The land was still devoid of life, but in the oceans life now flourished.

134
00:09:31,340 --> 00:09:36,680
Cambrian fossils show a huge divergence of body types, possibly because of rapid evolution,

135
00:09:36,680 --> 00:09:42,340
the so-called Cambrian explosion, or possibly because animals had evolved hard body parts,

136
00:09:42,340 --> 00:09:45,680
which fossilised more easily.

137
00:09:45,680 --> 00:09:50,720
During the next geological period, the Ordovician, the Iapetus Ocean closed.

138
00:09:50,720 --> 00:09:56,300
Laurentia collided with a smaller continent called Avalonia, and then the mini-continent

139
00:09:56,300 --> 00:09:57,740
of Baltica.

140
00:09:57,740 --> 00:10:04,120
The series of collisions threw up a huge mountain chain as big and impressive as the Alps today.

141
00:10:04,120 --> 00:10:08,400
The granite bulk of the continents and the thick band of ocean sediments in between them

142
00:10:08,400 --> 00:10:10,040
were thrust upwards.

143
00:10:10,040 --> 00:10:13,760
Scotland, which had been part of Laurentia, was fused to England.

144
00:10:13,760 --> 00:10:16,920
Yes, to all Scots out there, I feel your pain.

145
00:10:16,920 --> 00:10:22,760
Connecticut was fused to New York, and a new continent called Euramerica was created.

146
00:10:22,760 --> 00:10:27,540
But as we'll see, it was pulled apart again hundreds of millions of years later.

147
00:10:27,540 --> 00:10:31,520
The remnants of this crustal collision can still be found in the eastern part of the

148
00:10:31,520 --> 00:10:35,600
North American continent and parts of northwest Europe.

149
00:10:35,600 --> 00:10:40,840
The rise of the mountain chain increased weathering, because high altitude rocks are more exposed

150
00:10:40,840 --> 00:10:42,560
and weather faster.

151
00:10:42,560 --> 00:10:47,040
And because CO2 is used in the weathering process, this reduced the concentration of

152
00:10:47,040 --> 00:10:52,880
CO2 in the atmosphere, lowered the temperature and triggered another ice age.

153
00:10:52,880 --> 00:10:56,840
Unlike Snowball Earth, this ice age lasted only a few million years.

154
00:10:56,840 --> 00:11:02,400
It was centred on what's now the Sahara Desert and covered much of Gondwanaland.

155
00:11:02,400 --> 00:11:06,100
The new continent of Euramerica was further north.

156
00:11:06,100 --> 00:11:11,560
As water got locked up in ice, and because water shrinks in volume as it cools, sea levels

157
00:11:11,560 --> 00:11:12,880
fell.

158
00:11:12,880 --> 00:11:17,440
Geologists think the retreating coastline had a major impact on marine life and may

159
00:11:17,440 --> 00:11:23,320
have contributed to the Earth's first mass extinction at the end of the Ordovician.

160
00:11:23,320 --> 00:11:27,520
As CO2 levels climbed again, they pushed temperatures back up.

161
00:11:27,520 --> 00:11:32,880
During the Silurian period, the Earth was once again a hothouse and sea levels rose.

162
00:11:32,880 --> 00:11:39,080
The oceans covered Ordovician rocks that had been exposed and eroded over millions of years.

163
00:11:39,080 --> 00:11:44,240
Ordinarily one layer of sediment gets laid down on top of an older one in sequence, but

164
00:11:44,240 --> 00:11:50,880
when the sea retreats or the land gets uplifted out of the water, that process stops.

165
00:11:50,880 --> 00:11:56,120
Seats may be exposed and eroded, even faltered and folded, over millions of years, so when

166
00:11:56,120 --> 00:12:02,560
the sea covers them again and lays down new sediment, you get what's called an unconformity.

167
00:12:02,560 --> 00:12:04,840
Which leads me to Bin Laden.

168
00:12:04,840 --> 00:12:10,080
In 2001 I was watching the news and a video from Osama Bin Laden was played in which he

169
00:12:10,080 --> 00:12:13,200
stood in front of a distinctive rock formation.

170
00:12:13,200 --> 00:12:18,240
I'm not a sedimentologist, but the fuzzy image looked like a shale or a limestone sitting

171
00:12:18,240 --> 00:12:20,680
on top of an unconformity.

172
00:12:20,680 --> 00:12:25,040
Surely I thought the intelligence services can figure out where that is.

173
00:12:25,040 --> 00:12:30,480
And sure enough, a few weeks later a geologist who'd done some exploration work in Afghanistan

174
00:12:30,480 --> 00:12:36,240
said he knew exactly where that was and passed the information on to the CIA.

175
00:12:36,240 --> 00:12:41,360
From then on Bin Laden delivered his Death to America speeches in front of a plain cloth

176
00:12:41,360 --> 00:12:43,360
background.

177
00:12:43,360 --> 00:12:48,400
But getting back to the Silurian, the Silurian is also notable as a period when land plants

178
00:12:48,400 --> 00:12:52,080
evolved and spread across the continents.

179
00:12:52,080 --> 00:12:56,400
A few hundred million years later, during the Devonian, sea-based insects and animals

180
00:12:56,400 --> 00:13:02,500
also started venturing onto the land and fish became the dominant species of the oceans.

181
00:13:02,500 --> 00:13:08,280
The mosses and lichens of the Silurian evolved into bushes that put down deep roots and weren't

182
00:13:08,280 --> 00:13:11,560
dependent on surface water to survive.

183
00:13:11,560 --> 00:13:14,720
And so they expanded across the continents.

184
00:13:14,720 --> 00:13:19,120
And as they did so, they sucked out carbon dioxide from the atmosphere and that once

185
00:13:19,120 --> 00:13:20,840
again cooled the earth.

186
00:13:20,840 --> 00:13:25,840
It's possible this cooling helped contribute to a mass extinction in the oceans, the earth's

187
00:13:25,840 --> 00:13:28,540
second mass extinction.

188
00:13:28,540 --> 00:13:33,000
The cooling continued into the next geological period, the Carboniferous.

189
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:36,280
And with a cooler earth came retreating sea levels.

190
00:13:36,280 --> 00:13:39,920
Shallow seas and swamps were left behind.

191
00:13:39,920 --> 00:13:44,560
The wandering continents of Gondwanaland and Euramerica came together again to form a

192
00:13:44,560 --> 00:13:47,680
another supercontinent, Pangaea.

193
00:13:47,680 --> 00:13:53,040
West Africa collided with the eastern seaboard of North America and the Appalachian Mountains,

194
00:13:53,040 --> 00:13:57,800
which had first risen during the Ordovician and been worn down, were again buckled and

195
00:13:57,800 --> 00:14:01,720
uplifted like the crumple zone of a car crash.

196
00:14:01,720 --> 00:14:06,440
Bushes evolved into the first trees and huge forests covered the swamps.

197
00:14:06,440 --> 00:14:11,560
Fish that could use their fins as limbs to negotiate the roots and stems gained an evolutionary

198
00:14:11,560 --> 00:14:16,820
advantage in the hunt for food and evolved into the first tetrapods, four-legged animals

199
00:14:16,820 --> 00:14:21,140
that were the forerunners of lizards, dinosaurs and mammals.

200
00:14:21,140 --> 00:14:25,980
The proliferation of plant life increased the oxygen content of the atmosphere.

201
00:14:25,980 --> 00:14:30,600
Because insects absorb oxygen through their skin, that allowed them to grow to enormous

202
00:14:30,600 --> 00:14:32,180
size.

203
00:14:32,180 --> 00:14:36,680
But as well as releasing oxygen, the forests also took in huge amounts of carbon dioxide

204
00:14:36,680 --> 00:14:38,640
in order to grow.

205
00:14:38,640 --> 00:14:43,940
Only that carbon would be released back into the atmosphere when the trees died and decayed.

206
00:14:43,940 --> 00:14:48,920
But during the Carboniferous, the vegetation sank into shallow swamps where oxygen levels

207
00:14:48,920 --> 00:14:52,640
were low and didn't decompose.

208
00:14:52,640 --> 00:14:57,000
After millions of years of compression and heating, these layers of wood and vegetation

209
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:59,360
turned into coal seams.

210
00:14:59,360 --> 00:15:04,200
This paleomap of the Carboniferous in Europe shows how the shallow water coincides with

211
00:15:04,200 --> 00:15:10,080
the coal fields of Germany, Britain, Poland and Northern France.

212
00:15:10,080 --> 00:15:15,300
The falling carbon dioxide concentration cooled the earth so much that it once again triggered

213
00:15:15,300 --> 00:15:17,080
an ice age.

214
00:15:17,080 --> 00:15:22,560
Sea levels dropped even further and the Carboniferous swamp forests began to disappear.

215
00:15:22,560 --> 00:15:27,320
The tetrapods of the Carboniferous had evolved into a weird looking clade of reptiles called

216
00:15:27,320 --> 00:15:33,360
synapsids and were still a long time before the appearance of the dinosaurs.

217
00:15:33,360 --> 00:15:39,320
The supercontinent Pangaea was now so large that rain clouds rarely penetrated the interior,

218
00:15:39,320 --> 00:15:41,640
creating huge deserts.

219
00:15:41,640 --> 00:15:46,080
Offshore a ring of smaller continents enclosed a sea called the Tethys that would have a

220
00:15:46,080 --> 00:15:51,080
profound effect on our economy 250 million years later.

221
00:15:51,080 --> 00:15:55,000
Algae and plankton thrived in this warm tropical sea.

222
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:59,280
When they died, they fell to the bottom and got buried in mud.

223
00:15:59,280 --> 00:16:04,040
There was only a weak circulation system in the Tethys, a bit like the Black Sea today,

224
00:16:04,040 --> 00:16:09,240
so organic matter didn't decay in the stagnant oxygen-free depths.

225
00:16:09,240 --> 00:16:13,640
This build-up of organic sediment in the Tethys would continue for hundreds of millions of

226
00:16:13,640 --> 00:16:19,040
years throughout the next four geological periods, uninterrupted by mountain building

227
00:16:19,040 --> 00:16:22,600
or tectonic subsidence.

228
00:16:22,600 --> 00:16:27,560
Over time the buried sediment got compressed and heated and formed sedimentary rock.

229
00:16:27,560 --> 00:16:33,660
The organic matter trapped in the mud was also heated and broke down into simple hydrocarbons,

230
00:16:33,660 --> 00:16:36,440
in other words oil and gas.

231
00:16:36,440 --> 00:16:41,440
The mud turned into shale, which is a flaky permeable rock.

232
00:16:41,440 --> 00:16:45,440
Meanwhile on the other side of the continent was another stagnant sea covering much of

233
00:16:45,440 --> 00:16:48,400
what's now the western part of North America.

234
00:16:48,400 --> 00:16:53,920
Called the Permian Basin, it also collected organic matter buried in mud and sand that

235
00:16:53,920 --> 00:16:56,360
turned into shale and sandstone.

236
00:16:56,360 --> 00:17:01,860
This would eventually give us the oil shales and oil sands of the United States and Canada.

237
00:17:01,860 --> 00:17:06,200
Towards the end of the Permian, molten rock and gas from the upper mantle forced its way

238
00:17:06,200 --> 00:17:11,600
up through the crust in Siberia and released what's called a flood basalt.

239
00:17:11,600 --> 00:17:16,200
It poured billions of tonnes of carbon dioxide back into the atmosphere, pushing temperatures

240
00:17:16,200 --> 00:17:21,360
up again into hothouse conditions and another mass extinction followed.

241
00:17:21,360 --> 00:17:26,960
This would mark the boundary of the Permian and the next geological period, the Triassic.

242
00:17:26,960 --> 00:17:32,260
In this mass extinction, 95% of the species on Earth disappeared.

243
00:17:32,260 --> 00:17:36,000
The Triassic is a rather boring period in geological terms.

244
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:39,440
There was little mountain building taking place because all the continents were now

245
00:17:39,440 --> 00:17:44,120
joined into a supercontinent that stretched from pole to pole.

246
00:17:44,120 --> 00:17:48,220
Even though the sun was weaker back then, the high levels of carbon dioxide ensured

247
00:17:48,220 --> 00:17:51,620
it was way too hot for ice at either pole.

248
00:17:51,620 --> 00:17:56,100
The hothouse produced featureless deserts and many of the rocks from that period are

249
00:17:56,100 --> 00:17:59,480
characterised by red wind-blurned sands.

250
00:17:59,480 --> 00:18:04,100
Most animals had gone extinct, so in the early Triassic there weren't even many fossils

251
00:18:04,100 --> 00:18:06,660
to make the period interesting.

252
00:18:06,660 --> 00:18:11,940
The mass extinction opened up opportunities for the survivors because every organism inhabits

253
00:18:11,940 --> 00:18:16,500
a niche, a specialist role which can exploit resources.

254
00:18:16,500 --> 00:18:21,580
So when a lot of niches are suddenly opened up, animals will evolve to fill them.

255
00:18:21,580 --> 00:18:27,180
One of them was a tiny shrew-like burrowing animal that gave birth to live young and suckled

256
00:18:27,180 --> 00:18:30,500
them, the ancestor of all mammals.

257
00:18:30,500 --> 00:18:33,580
Another was an animal called the archosaur.

258
00:18:33,580 --> 00:18:38,420
The Triassic ended with another mass extinction, although the cause of this is not yet well

259
00:18:38,420 --> 00:18:39,880
understood.

260
00:18:39,880 --> 00:18:42,620
The archosaurs survived that one too.

261
00:18:42,620 --> 00:18:47,740
So when niches opened up at the start of the next period, the Jurassic, the archosaur filled

262
00:18:47,740 --> 00:18:54,080
them by evolving into the most famous ancient animals of all, the dinosaurs.

263
00:18:54,080 --> 00:18:57,340
During the Jurassic, Pangaea began to break apart.

264
00:18:57,340 --> 00:19:01,960
A rift opened up between Norway and Greenland, and then the eastern seaboard of the United

265
00:19:01,960 --> 00:19:05,100
States pulled away from West Africa.

266
00:19:05,100 --> 00:19:08,020
This was the birth of the Atlantic Ocean.

267
00:19:08,020 --> 00:19:12,980
In the western part of the Tethys Sea, Europe was just a patchwork of islands and crustal

268
00:19:12,980 --> 00:19:14,460
plates.

269
00:19:14,460 --> 00:19:19,300
Thick layers of limestone built up in these shallow seas millions of years later, providing

270
00:19:19,300 --> 00:19:23,100
the building material for Europe's great cathedrals.

271
00:19:23,100 --> 00:19:26,180
The limestone was also important for another reason.

272
00:19:26,180 --> 00:19:31,260
In the Tethys Sea, a constant stream of organic material had been buried in mud since the

273
00:19:31,260 --> 00:19:32,620
Permian.

274
00:19:32,620 --> 00:19:37,740
As limestone and sandstone piled up on top, the pressure and heat turned the organic material

275
00:19:37,780 --> 00:19:41,700
into oil and gas and the mud into shale.

276
00:19:41,700 --> 00:19:46,340
The oil and gas worked its way up through these permeable and porous rocks until it

277
00:19:46,340 --> 00:19:53,620
hit impermeable rock in folds and along fault lines, unconformities, and salt domes where

278
00:19:53,620 --> 00:20:00,180
less dense layers of salt laid down by evaporating seas move upwards through denser rock.

279
00:20:00,180 --> 00:20:04,060
These places where oil gets stuck because it can't move up any further are called

280
00:20:04,060 --> 00:20:06,940
traps.

281
00:20:07,020 --> 00:20:10,540
Tethys look for them by bouncing sound waves off the rocks below.

282
00:20:10,540 --> 00:20:16,300
When they find them, the exploration drilling team goes in to see if the traps contain oil.

283
00:20:16,300 --> 00:20:20,140
And in the Mediterranean and the North Sea, that was my job.

284
00:20:20,140 --> 00:20:23,140
So why does the Middle East have so much oil?

285
00:20:23,140 --> 00:20:27,140
Not only because over hundreds of millions of years the Tethys was a stable collecting

286
00:20:27,140 --> 00:20:32,660
point for trillions of tonnes of dead organic matter, but also because the shales, limestones

287
00:20:32,660 --> 00:20:36,460
and evaporites ensured that the Middle East was full of oil traps.

288
00:20:36,460 --> 00:20:42,540
It's in the rock formations of the Triassic, Jurassic and Cretaceous that 70% of the modern

289
00:20:42,540 --> 00:20:44,620
world's oil is found.

290
00:20:44,620 --> 00:20:48,700
The plants and animals that formed this oil took their carbon dioxide from CO2 in the

291
00:20:48,700 --> 00:20:51,660
atmosphere and of course buried it with them.

292
00:20:51,660 --> 00:20:56,540
So once again carbon dioxide levels fell, helped by the background process of chemical

293
00:20:56,540 --> 00:21:00,180
weathering that created the Jurassic limestone.

294
00:21:00,180 --> 00:21:04,700
The falling concentration of CO2 lowered global temperature and took the Earth out

295
00:21:04,700 --> 00:21:06,420
of its hothouse.

296
00:21:06,420 --> 00:21:11,940
As Pangaea broke up, moisture and ocean winds penetrated the arid interior.

297
00:21:11,940 --> 00:21:17,180
Conifer forests filled with ferns spread across the islands and continents.

298
00:21:17,180 --> 00:21:21,860
The first dinosaurs to dominate this new landscape were the sauropods.

299
00:21:21,860 --> 00:21:26,720
Contrary to Hollywood myth, the Jurassic wasn't the true age of the dinosaurs, they really

300
00:21:26,720 --> 00:21:30,960
flourished during the next geological period, the Cretaceous.

301
00:21:30,960 --> 00:21:35,940
This is where we get Tyrannosaurus rex and lots of other familiar dinosaurs.

302
00:21:35,940 --> 00:21:40,640
The Cretaceous was also marked by a series of flood basalt events in India that poured

303
00:21:40,640 --> 00:21:44,540
trillions of tonnes of carbon dioxide back into the air.

304
00:21:44,540 --> 00:21:48,400
As CO2 concentrations rose, so did the temperature.

305
00:21:48,400 --> 00:21:52,600
By the late Cretaceous, the Earth was in hothouse conditions again.

306
00:21:53,320 --> 00:21:58,080
I often hear people point to the Cretaceous hothouse as a wonderful time when dinosaurs

307
00:21:58,080 --> 00:22:02,000
flourished when there was thick forest and warm weather at the poles.

308
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:05,080
Wouldn't it be nice if the Earth was like that today?

309
00:22:05,080 --> 00:22:10,360
Well, yes, there were large areas of natural forest during the Cretaceous, just as there

310
00:22:10,360 --> 00:22:12,000
are today.

311
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:16,400
And of course with a warmer climate comes higher sea levels, exacerbated during the

312
00:22:16,400 --> 00:22:19,180
Cretaceous by crustal movement.

313
00:22:19,180 --> 00:22:24,340
With no water locked up in ice at the poles, and with warmer water expanding, the oceans

314
00:22:24,340 --> 00:22:29,040
covered the Great Plains of North America and nearly all of Europe, the Middle East,

315
00:22:29,040 --> 00:22:31,340
North Africa and Central Asia.

316
00:22:31,340 --> 00:22:37,600
In fact the areas that cover most of today's farmland and population centres were underwater.

317
00:22:37,600 --> 00:22:41,640
So perhaps it's not a climate we'd want to emulate.

318
00:22:41,640 --> 00:22:46,420
In these warm seas, tiny plankton called coccolithophores thrived.

319
00:22:46,420 --> 00:22:51,140
Their shells fell to the sea floor and built up a thick layer of chalk.

320
00:22:51,140 --> 00:22:55,420
This is so much a characteristic rock of the period that the Cretaceous takes its name

321
00:22:55,420 --> 00:22:58,360
from the Latin word for chalk.

322
00:22:58,360 --> 00:23:03,660
The outpouring of gases and lava led to falling dinosaur's numbers and they were finally

323
00:23:03,660 --> 00:23:08,980
killed off by a huge asteroid impact marking the end of the Cretaceous and the start of

324
00:23:08,980 --> 00:23:14,300
the Tertiary, or the Paleogene and Neogene as they call it in the United States.

325
00:23:15,020 --> 00:23:20,180
It's likely the only surviving dinosaurs were smaller, feathered species that most researchers

326
00:23:20,180 --> 00:23:22,860
now conclude evolved into birds.

327
00:23:22,860 --> 00:23:29,260
For the tiny burrowing mammals that also survived, the world was now full of vacant niches into

328
00:23:29,260 --> 00:23:31,120
which they evolved.

329
00:23:31,120 --> 00:23:36,000
The herds of large grazing dinosaurs were replaced by large grazing mammals.

330
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:41,800
The pack hunting carnivore dinosaurs were replaced by pack hunting carnivore mammals.

331
00:23:42,040 --> 00:23:46,600
But how do we know that one group of animals replaced another, or that one group of animals

332
00:23:46,600 --> 00:23:48,760
evolved into another?

333
00:23:48,760 --> 00:23:54,520
The answer takes us back to the basic geological principle that newer sediment overlays older

334
00:23:54,520 --> 00:23:55,520
sediment.

335
00:23:55,520 --> 00:23:57,520
Let's look at an analogy.

336
00:23:57,520 --> 00:24:01,880
Imagine there's a garbage dump outside Lincoln, California which was started when the town

337
00:24:01,880 --> 00:24:08,020
was founded in 1890, about the time households began using telephones.

338
00:24:08,020 --> 00:24:13,220
Within a few years, broken or discarded telephones would be thrown into the Lincoln garbage dump

339
00:24:13,220 --> 00:24:17,740
in the same way dead animals fall to the bottom of the sea.

340
00:24:17,740 --> 00:24:20,900
Over time, other garbage piles up on top.

341
00:24:20,900 --> 00:24:25,440
As the telephone evolved into better and more efficient models, these got dumped on top

342
00:24:25,440 --> 00:24:28,620
too, above the older ones.

343
00:24:28,620 --> 00:24:33,460
Telephones dating from the 1920s are different again, so when they got thrown out they end

344
00:24:33,460 --> 00:24:35,760
up here, and so on.

345
00:24:35,760 --> 00:24:41,360
Through the 1940s, 50s and 60s, right up to the era of mobile phones.

346
00:24:41,360 --> 00:24:46,240
But even mobile phones are evolving, and when older models get thrown away, they get buried

347
00:24:46,240 --> 00:24:48,560
underneath newer models.

348
00:24:48,560 --> 00:24:53,160
So if archaeologists 20,000 years from now uncover this garbage dump, they'll be able

349
00:24:53,160 --> 00:24:57,640
to tell which telephones were older and which were newer, based on where they lie in the

350
00:24:57,640 --> 00:24:59,120
strata.

351
00:24:59,120 --> 00:25:03,900
So if the archaeologists found a pile of garbage elsewhere in California, they'd be able to

352
00:25:03,900 --> 00:25:09,100
instantly place it in the chronology, based on the type of phone they find there.

353
00:25:09,100 --> 00:25:15,860
Similarly, as a general principle, we get newer fossils lying on top of older ones.

354
00:25:15,860 --> 00:25:20,580
So just like the phones, we can see small differences as these animals evolved over

355
00:25:20,580 --> 00:25:21,820
time.

356
00:25:21,820 --> 00:25:26,180
If I can date a rock which has a particular fossil in it, and I find another rock with

357
00:25:26,180 --> 00:25:30,980
an identical fossil thousands of miles away, then there's a very good chance both rocks

358
00:25:30,980 --> 00:25:33,360
are of the same age.

359
00:25:33,360 --> 00:25:38,160
The breakup of Pangaea during the Cretaceous gave rise to another era of drifting continents

360
00:25:38,160 --> 00:25:41,780
and continental collisions during the Tertiary.

361
00:25:41,780 --> 00:25:45,740
India crashed into Asia, thrusting up the Himalayas.

362
00:25:45,740 --> 00:25:48,920
Africa collided with Europe, pushing up the Alps.

363
00:25:48,920 --> 00:25:53,680
The subduction of oceanic plates gave rise to the Andes Mountains and the mountains of

364
00:25:53,680 --> 00:25:56,060
New Zealand and Japan.

365
00:25:56,060 --> 00:26:01,440
This era of mountain building sped up chemical weathering that once again sucked carbon dioxide

366
00:26:01,440 --> 00:26:06,480
out of the air, which cooled the Earth and sparked its fifth ice age, covering a period

367
00:26:06,480 --> 00:26:08,940
called the Quaternary.

368
00:26:08,940 --> 00:26:13,600
This is the shortest of our geological time periods, just one minute before now on our

369
00:26:13,600 --> 00:26:15,080
time clock.

370
00:26:15,080 --> 00:26:18,720
It wouldn't even rate a mention, except for the fact that it's the period we happen

371
00:26:18,720 --> 00:26:20,680
to live in.

372
00:26:20,680 --> 00:26:24,040
Our ice age isn't a uniform period of cold.

373
00:26:24,040 --> 00:26:28,160
It's characterised by cycles called glaciations and interglacials.

374
00:26:28,160 --> 00:26:32,440
The transition is sparked by tiny amounts of warming and cooling, as the Earth's tilt

375
00:26:32,440 --> 00:26:37,760
and orbit regularly change the pattern of sunlight it receives.

376
00:26:37,760 --> 00:26:42,000
Normally these orbital cycles make little difference to the temperature of the Earth,

377
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:47,720
but during an ice age, even the tiniest amount of warming and cooling gets amplified by what's

378
00:26:47,720 --> 00:26:50,000
called positive feedback.

379
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:54,180
That's because a little bit of warming can melt a little bit of ice, reducing the amount

380
00:26:54,180 --> 00:26:58,000
of sunlight it reflects, therefore amplifying the warming.

381
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:02,680
The melting of the ice unlocks methane from frozen soils, and a little bit of warming

382
00:27:02,680 --> 00:27:06,780
causes the oceans to release carbon dioxide.

383
00:27:06,780 --> 00:27:10,020
Both are powerful greenhouse gases.

384
00:27:10,020 --> 00:27:13,720
During glaciations, much of the Earth's water is locked up in ice, and much of the

385
00:27:13,720 --> 00:27:18,240
water that remains in the oceans is cold, so it shrinks.

386
00:27:18,240 --> 00:27:23,620
During deglaciations, most of the ice melts and the warm waters expand, so sea levels

387
00:27:23,620 --> 00:27:29,120
rose and fell by several hundred feet between glacial cycles.

388
00:27:29,120 --> 00:27:34,020
Because of the regular cyclical nature of glacials and interglacials, a lot of posters

389
00:27:34,020 --> 00:27:39,520
on my channel seem to believe that the Earth's geological history consists of cycles.

390
00:27:39,520 --> 00:27:43,680
In nearly every case, it turns out that they are confusing different periods of geological

391
00:27:43,680 --> 00:27:47,640
history, so let's put this in perspective.

392
00:27:47,640 --> 00:27:52,600
This red dot represents the last 1000 years on the bottom timescale, and here's the

393
00:27:52,600 --> 00:27:58,860
last 650,000 years, a third of our current ice age, comprising glacial and interglacial

394
00:27:58,860 --> 00:28:00,940
cycles.

395
00:28:00,940 --> 00:28:05,600
None of these orbital cycles affect the climate during your lifetime or mine.

396
00:28:05,600 --> 00:28:09,940
They're on a scale of thousands of years, and the next time they begin sending us back

397
00:28:09,940 --> 00:28:15,760
into another glaciation will be long after your great-great-great-great-great-grandchildren

398
00:28:15,760 --> 00:28:21,380
have been dead and forgotten by their great-great-great-great-grandchildren.

399
00:28:21,380 --> 00:28:27,580
And this is where the entire ice age stands in relation to the last 500 million years.

400
00:28:27,580 --> 00:28:33,340
In relation to our geological clock, it's just one second out of eight hours, two million

401
00:28:33,340 --> 00:28:36,140
years out of a billion.

402
00:28:36,140 --> 00:28:41,760
For most of the last 500 million years, outside of these very short ice ages, orbital cycles

403
00:28:41,760 --> 00:28:47,380
have no discernible influence on global temperature, because the changes in insolation they produce

404
00:28:47,380 --> 00:28:49,360
are far too weak.

405
00:28:49,360 --> 00:28:55,120
As for continental drift, flood basalt events, CO2 concentration, global temperature, solar

406
00:28:55,120 --> 00:29:01,600
irradiance and other constantly changing features of the Earth, these don't follow regular cycles,

407
00:29:01,600 --> 00:29:04,380
either in time or amplitude.

408
00:29:04,380 --> 00:29:09,340
But no need to go to the other extreme and say that the whole system is chaotic either.

409
00:29:09,340 --> 00:29:14,560
With the exception of flood basalts and continental rifting, the mechanisms which cause these

410
00:29:14,560 --> 00:29:17,420
events are pretty well understood.

411
00:29:17,420 --> 00:29:22,420
We know they follow basic principles of physics, we know that most of them are linked, and

412
00:29:22,420 --> 00:29:26,180
in some cases they're even predictable.

413
00:29:26,180 --> 00:29:31,300
So just to be clear, these glacial cycles aren't ice ages, and they don't represent

414
00:29:31,300 --> 00:29:33,460
the Earth's geological history.

415
00:29:33,460 --> 00:29:38,800
They're part of an ice age, and make up just one minute of the eight hours on our geological

416
00:29:38,800 --> 00:29:39,800
clock.

417
00:29:39,800 --> 00:29:45,860
It's a history that includes at least five ice ages, five mass extinctions and hundreds

418
00:29:45,860 --> 00:29:48,220
of millions of years of hothouse.

419
00:29:48,220 --> 00:29:53,500
Our Earth has experienced a world of deserts, a world devoid of plant life, a world of ice

420
00:29:53,500 --> 00:29:56,500
and a world of water.

421
00:29:56,500 --> 00:30:01,820
So here we are today, at one o'clock in the afternoon, in a warm interglacial that's

422
00:30:01,820 --> 00:30:08,340
a pretty pleasant place to live, and has given rise to the civilisation we now enjoy.

423
00:30:08,340 --> 00:30:10,180
And what of the future?

424
00:30:10,180 --> 00:30:15,620
Well according to researchers, our interglacial should last about another 20,000 years, giving

425
00:30:15,620 --> 00:30:20,420
us a benign climate and stable sea levels for thousands more generations.

426
00:30:20,420 --> 00:30:24,080
Unless, of course, we stuff that up.

427
00:30:24,080 --> 00:30:28,900
But tens of thousands of years is the blink of an eye in geological terms.

428
00:30:28,900 --> 00:30:34,300
If we look tens of millions of years into the future, Australia will continue drifting

429
00:30:34,300 --> 00:30:40,580
northwards, Africa will close the gap with Europe and squeeze out the Mediterranean Sea,

430
00:30:40,580 --> 00:30:43,620
and the two American continents will separate.

431
00:30:43,620 --> 00:30:49,260
250 million years from now, our mountain chains will have worn down, new ones will

432
00:30:49,260 --> 00:30:55,020
have risen, and all the continents will be fused into yet another supercontinent.

433
00:30:55,020 --> 00:31:00,100
This will be three o'clock in the afternoon on our geological clock.

434
00:31:00,100 --> 00:31:02,780
Will our species survive until then?

435
00:31:02,780 --> 00:31:08,740
Well the dinosaurs lasted 160 million years before going extinct, so if humans can survive

436
00:31:08,740 --> 00:31:12,740
as long as that, the answer is no.

437
00:31:12,740 --> 00:31:18,500
We won't be around 250 million years from now, but perhaps geologists of this future

438
00:31:18,500 --> 00:31:23,540
world, whatever they look like, will develop the same technology we have to delve into

439
00:31:23,540 --> 00:31:24,540
the past.

440
00:31:24,540 --> 00:31:30,700
They'll notice a sharp rise in carbon dioxide, accompanied by a sharp rise in temperature

441
00:31:30,700 --> 00:31:33,440
from our geological period.

442
00:31:33,440 --> 00:31:36,940
But this time there won't be any flood basalts to explain it.

443
00:31:36,940 --> 00:31:42,260
They'll dig through rocks uplifted and eroded over hundreds of millions of years and find

444
00:31:42,300 --> 00:31:47,340
evidence of a sea level rise that buried strange geometric stones.

445
00:31:47,340 --> 00:31:53,580
They'll see signs of the Earth's sixth mass extinction and a sudden disappearance of forests.

446
00:31:53,580 --> 00:32:01,580
All this in the blink of an eye, 0.0005 seconds on our geological clock, which is actually

447
00:32:01,580 --> 00:32:05,540
200 times faster than the blink of an eye.

448
00:32:05,540 --> 00:32:10,500
And from time to time, since land fossils aren't as well preserved as marine fossils,

449
00:32:10,540 --> 00:32:15,780
these future geologists will find bits of fossilized bone in the ancient rock that suggest

450
00:32:15,780 --> 00:32:19,280
the presence of some kind of upright primate.

451
00:32:19,280 --> 00:32:21,940
They'll no doubt wonder if there's any link.

452
00:32:40,500 --> 00:32:42,580
you
