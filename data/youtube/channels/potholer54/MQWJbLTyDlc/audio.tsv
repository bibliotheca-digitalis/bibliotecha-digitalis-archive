0	5180	I'm making this video because, as a former geologist turned science journalist, when
5180	9580	I've tried to explain the Earth's history during discussions on my channel, people seem
9580	14620	to be very confused about time scales and how all this happened.
14620	19580	So in this video I'm going to show some basic geological principles and how they relate
19580	22780	to the Earth's journey through the last billion years.
22780	27420	I'll answer questions like why is there so much oil in the Middle East?
27420	30880	How did geology help in the hunt for Osama bin Laden?
30880	33900	How does the Ice Age fit into the Earth's history?
33900	39980	What causes changes in climate and are there any cycles and patterns in all this?
39980	45540	Let's first travel back through time to our starting point about a billion years ago.
45540	50380	The Earth is a lot older than that and we can find rocks going back over three billion
50380	55500	years, but a billion years ago is when things start getting interesting.
55500	60300	We'll call this dawn, five o'clock in the morning, and end our journey at one o'clock
60300	63540	in the afternoon, the present time.
63540	67700	Then we'll go forward in time and see what will happen to the Earth 250 million years
67700	69700	into the future.
69700	74020	So each minute will represent about two million years.
74020	78460	By the time we get to our starting point, the Earth's protocontinents have already been
78460	83300	moving around for hundreds of millions of years, and a billion years ago most of them
83300	87220	were joined into one supercontinent called Rodinia.
87220	91820	The Earth's crust may be solid, but on a large scale it's very flexible.
91820	97180	It's made of a number of plates, driven around by currents of molten rock in the upper mantle.
97180	101700	Where thinner and denser oceanic plates made of basalt were driven against thicker and
101700	107220	lighter continental plates made of granite, the denser plate got subducted.
107220	111340	When that happened, the edge of the continent buckled and molten rock from the descending
111340	115220	crust rose to form volcanic mountain chains.
115220	119660	When the subducting oceanic crust ran out, the continents themselves would collide and
119660	123220	fuse, throwing up mountain chains.
123220	127860	Basalt and granite fit within one of three rock classifications, igneous rocks, in other
127860	131740	words molten rock that's cooled and solidified.
131740	136360	Where it cools slowly, the crystals have time to gravitate together, forming large-grained
136360	138340	rocks like granite.
138340	143320	Where the rock is cooled quickly, the crystals don't have time to grow so they're quite small,
143320	145820	forming fine-grained rocks like basalt.
145820	150340	A good rule of thumb is that the larger the grain size, the deeper underground and igneous
150340	152420	rock has formed.
152420	155640	Rodonia lasted for over 300 million years.
155640	160300	There was no life on land, just clusters of single-celled organisms building structures
160300	164720	called stromatolites in shallow seas near the shoreline.
164720	170580	About 750 million years ago, Rodonia began breaking apart.
170580	174680	The sea that opened up between North America and Australia became a dumping ground for
174680	179580	sediments that would later get uplifted by another tectonic collision forming most of
179580	183760	western Canada and the northwestern United States.
183760	188540	This brings us to our first geological principle â€“ uplift and erosion.
188540	193220	Land masses get lifted up through crustal movements, then eroded through processes like
193220	194860	chemical weathering.
194860	199480	This reacts carbon dioxide in the air with silicates in the rocks and the eroded material
199480	205320	is washed out to sea to form calcium carbonates, the main ingredient of limestone.
205320	209520	It's an important process for the climate because over time it sucks carbon dioxide
209520	211100	out of the air.
211100	216080	Some of this limestone gets dragged down through subduction and melts, pumping CO2 back into
216080	218380	the air through volcanoes.
218400	223620	Fortunately for us, a lot of this carbon dioxide remains locked up in limestones today.
223620	228720	There's also mechanical weathering which takes out large chunks of rock through processes
228720	235640	like freeze and thaw or wind erosion and then grinds down the rock as it travels down rivers.
235640	240420	The result is mud, silt, sand or pebbles according to grain size.
240420	245440	These soft sediments build up around the continents, giving us our second principle of geology
245440	249440	that older sediments tend to lie underneath younger ones.
249440	254440	Hot water that ran through the sediments dissolved silica or calcium carbonate and then deposited
254440	258240	it between grains, binding the grains together.
258240	262860	Over millions of years this compression and cementation turned the sediments into solid
262860	267480	rock like shales, siltstone, sandstone and limestone.
267480	270520	These are known as sedimentary rocks.
270520	274520	Look carefully and you can often detect the environment in which they formed.
274520	278920	For example, cross-bedded sandstones show how ancient currents shifted.
278920	284440	Bands of mud inside a sandstone may indicate the ebb and flow of a tidal estuary.
284440	288800	Conglomerates formed from pebbles cemented together may indicate an ancient beach or
288800	290200	a riverbed.
290200	295080	They look almost identical to pebbly beaches and riverbeds we see today.
295080	300200	And this brings us to our third geological principle, the present is the key to the past.
300200	304500	If the features we see in the rocks are identical to the features we see today, it's strong
304500	308100	evidence that they were formed by the same processes.
308100	313460	For example, when molten lava is cooled quickly, it forms round lumps called pillow lavas,
313460	317500	identical to structures found in ancient basils.
317500	321460	This principle was brought home to me about 40 years ago when I was working for a diamond
321460	324020	exploration company in northwest Australia.
324020	326900	Yes, this really is me.
326900	331860	Our helicopter was coming down onto an area of rippling sand and I expected a cloud of
331860	335620	dust to come up as we landed, but there was none.
335620	339380	When I stepped onto the sand, it was rock hard.
339380	343980	It turned out that the ripples had been formed when this sand was part of a shallow pre-Cambrian
343980	347620	bay over a billion years ago.
347620	351800	If layers of igneous and sedimentary rock were buried very deeply, the pressure and
351800	357040	heat was so great that they changed into the third type of rock, metamorphic.
357040	362800	Over time, limestone became marble, shale became slate, sandstone became quartzite,
362800	364720	mudstone became schist.
364720	369560	The more pressure and heat that was applied, the greater the metamorphosis.
369560	375380	The heat comes from reservoirs of molten rock rising from the upper mantle, rich in minerals.
375380	381200	This intruded into weak points, often powerful enough to deform the sedimentary layers above.
381200	386040	When the magma cooled and cracked, hot water surged through it, depositing minerals like
386040	390080	silica and metals like gold.
390080	394200	Metamorphic and igneous rocks are still being formed today, but several kilometres under
394200	396160	the surface of the earth.
396160	400920	The only way we can see rocks like these is if they have been uplifted and then the strata
400920	403880	on top of them eroded away.
403880	407520	Uplift and erosion, which takes hundreds of millions of years.
407520	412680	So metamorphic and mineral-rich igneous rocks are predominantly found in the remnants of
412680	417440	the Precambrian, in ancient areas known as cratonic blocks or shields.
417440	422400	They're not only the oldest and most stable parts of the crust, they're also the richest
422400	424400	in minerals.
424400	428440	For a long time there was a paradox in this Precambrian world.
428440	433680	Just like a real dawn, the sun was much weaker back then, so weak that the earth should have
433680	436880	frozen over, and yet it didn't.
436880	441700	Geologists have concluded that what kept the earth warm was a high concentration of methane
441740	445540	and carbon dioxide, strong greenhouse gases.
445540	451420	As the concentration of these fell, exacerbated by other factors such as continental configuration,
451420	456340	temperatures began to drop and the earth went into an ice age.
456340	460740	Not this ice age, the one with mammoths and sabre-toothed tigers that began a mere two
460740	465660	million years ago, we're talking about the mother of all ice ages that occurred over
465660	471580	700 million years ago, when almost the entire surface of the earth froze over.
471580	476060	And because ice has a high albedo, in other words it's very reflective, what little
476060	479780	sunlight there was got reflected back into space.
479780	484020	So the earth might have stayed frozen if it wasn't for one thing.
484020	488800	Over a hundred million years, volcanoes under the ice continued pouring trillions of tonnes
488800	492320	of carbon dioxide back into the atmosphere.
492320	496740	This time there was no weathering process to wash it out, so the carbon dioxide kept
496740	501620	accumulating until it reached levels 20 times higher than today.
501620	505740	It acted like a blanket and trapped what little heat was coming in.
505740	511860	That started to melt the ice, reducing the albedo and warmed the earth even further.
511860	516860	Eventually the earth thawed out, and because CO2 levels were still very high, temperatures
516860	521220	continued climbing until the earth became a hot house with average global temperature
521220	526900	of around 70Â°F, about 13Â°C higher than today.
526900	529660	Coral reefs grew near the North Pole.
529660	533940	As we'll see throughout the earth's history, this link between carbon dioxide and global
533940	539420	temperature is so crucial that carbon dioxide has been called the earth's thermostat.
539420	542900	We're now in a period called the Cambrian.
542900	547340	Most of the continents were once again bunched together into a supercontinent, this one's
547340	552100	called Gondwanaland, although by the start of the Cambrian pieces of it had already begun
552100	553660	to break away.
553660	559060	An ancient ocean called the Iapetus was subducting under one of these pieces, the continent of
559060	560740	Laurentia.
560740	566160	Trillions of tonnes of sediment washed into the depression between the two crustal plates.
566160	571340	The land was still devoid of life, but in the oceans life now flourished.
571340	576680	Cambrian fossils show a huge divergence of body types, possibly because of rapid evolution,
576680	582340	the so-called Cambrian explosion, or possibly because animals had evolved hard body parts,
582340	585680	which fossilised more easily.
585680	590720	During the next geological period, the Ordovician, the Iapetus Ocean closed.
590720	596300	Laurentia collided with a smaller continent called Avalonia, and then the mini-continent
596300	597740	of Baltica.
597740	604120	The series of collisions threw up a huge mountain chain as big and impressive as the Alps today.
604120	608400	The granite bulk of the continents and the thick band of ocean sediments in between them
608400	610040	were thrust upwards.
610040	613760	Scotland, which had been part of Laurentia, was fused to England.
613760	616920	Yes, to all Scots out there, I feel your pain.
616920	622760	Connecticut was fused to New York, and a new continent called Euramerica was created.
622760	627540	But as we'll see, it was pulled apart again hundreds of millions of years later.
627540	631520	The remnants of this crustal collision can still be found in the eastern part of the
631520	635600	North American continent and parts of northwest Europe.
635600	640840	The rise of the mountain chain increased weathering, because high altitude rocks are more exposed
640840	642560	and weather faster.
642560	647040	And because CO2 is used in the weathering process, this reduced the concentration of
647040	652880	CO2 in the atmosphere, lowered the temperature and triggered another ice age.
652880	656840	Unlike Snowball Earth, this ice age lasted only a few million years.
656840	662400	It was centred on what's now the Sahara Desert and covered much of Gondwanaland.
662400	666100	The new continent of Euramerica was further north.
666100	671560	As water got locked up in ice, and because water shrinks in volume as it cools, sea levels
671560	672880	fell.
672880	677440	Geologists think the retreating coastline had a major impact on marine life and may
677440	683320	have contributed to the Earth's first mass extinction at the end of the Ordovician.
683320	687520	As CO2 levels climbed again, they pushed temperatures back up.
687520	692880	During the Silurian period, the Earth was once again a hothouse and sea levels rose.
692880	699080	The oceans covered Ordovician rocks that had been exposed and eroded over millions of years.
699080	704240	Ordinarily one layer of sediment gets laid down on top of an older one in sequence, but
704240	710880	when the sea retreats or the land gets uplifted out of the water, that process stops.
710880	716120	Seats may be exposed and eroded, even faltered and folded, over millions of years, so when
716120	722560	the sea covers them again and lays down new sediment, you get what's called an unconformity.
722560	724840	Which leads me to Bin Laden.
724840	730080	In 2001 I was watching the news and a video from Osama Bin Laden was played in which he
730080	733200	stood in front of a distinctive rock formation.
733200	738240	I'm not a sedimentologist, but the fuzzy image looked like a shale or a limestone sitting
738240	740680	on top of an unconformity.
740680	745040	Surely I thought the intelligence services can figure out where that is.
745040	750480	And sure enough, a few weeks later a geologist who'd done some exploration work in Afghanistan
750480	756240	said he knew exactly where that was and passed the information on to the CIA.
756240	761360	From then on Bin Laden delivered his Death to America speeches in front of a plain cloth
761360	763360	background.
763360	768400	But getting back to the Silurian, the Silurian is also notable as a period when land plants
768400	772080	evolved and spread across the continents.
772080	776400	A few hundred million years later, during the Devonian, sea-based insects and animals
776400	782500	also started venturing onto the land and fish became the dominant species of the oceans.
782500	788280	The mosses and lichens of the Silurian evolved into bushes that put down deep roots and weren't
788280	791560	dependent on surface water to survive.
791560	794720	And so they expanded across the continents.
794720	799120	And as they did so, they sucked out carbon dioxide from the atmosphere and that once
799120	800840	again cooled the earth.
800840	805840	It's possible this cooling helped contribute to a mass extinction in the oceans, the earth's
805840	808540	second mass extinction.
808540	813000	The cooling continued into the next geological period, the Carboniferous.
813000	816280	And with a cooler earth came retreating sea levels.
816280	819920	Shallow seas and swamps were left behind.
819920	824560	The wandering continents of Gondwanaland and Euramerica came together again to form a
824560	827680	another supercontinent, Pangaea.
827680	833040	West Africa collided with the eastern seaboard of North America and the Appalachian Mountains,
833040	837800	which had first risen during the Ordovician and been worn down, were again buckled and
837800	841720	uplifted like the crumple zone of a car crash.
841720	846440	Bushes evolved into the first trees and huge forests covered the swamps.
846440	851560	Fish that could use their fins as limbs to negotiate the roots and stems gained an evolutionary
851560	856820	advantage in the hunt for food and evolved into the first tetrapods, four-legged animals
856820	861140	that were the forerunners of lizards, dinosaurs and mammals.
861140	865980	The proliferation of plant life increased the oxygen content of the atmosphere.
865980	870600	Because insects absorb oxygen through their skin, that allowed them to grow to enormous
870600	872180	size.
872180	876680	But as well as releasing oxygen, the forests also took in huge amounts of carbon dioxide
876680	878640	in order to grow.
878640	883940	Only that carbon would be released back into the atmosphere when the trees died and decayed.
883940	888920	But during the Carboniferous, the vegetation sank into shallow swamps where oxygen levels
888920	892640	were low and didn't decompose.
892640	897000	After millions of years of compression and heating, these layers of wood and vegetation
897000	899360	turned into coal seams.
899360	904200	This paleomap of the Carboniferous in Europe shows how the shallow water coincides with
904200	910080	the coal fields of Germany, Britain, Poland and Northern France.
910080	915300	The falling carbon dioxide concentration cooled the earth so much that it once again triggered
915300	917080	an ice age.
917080	922560	Sea levels dropped even further and the Carboniferous swamp forests began to disappear.
922560	927320	The tetrapods of the Carboniferous had evolved into a weird looking clade of reptiles called
927320	933360	synapsids and were still a long time before the appearance of the dinosaurs.
933360	939320	The supercontinent Pangaea was now so large that rain clouds rarely penetrated the interior,
939320	941640	creating huge deserts.
941640	946080	Offshore a ring of smaller continents enclosed a sea called the Tethys that would have a
946080	951080	profound effect on our economy 250 million years later.
951080	955000	Algae and plankton thrived in this warm tropical sea.
955000	959280	When they died, they fell to the bottom and got buried in mud.
959280	964040	There was only a weak circulation system in the Tethys, a bit like the Black Sea today,
964040	969240	so organic matter didn't decay in the stagnant oxygen-free depths.
969240	973640	This build-up of organic sediment in the Tethys would continue for hundreds of millions of
973640	979040	years throughout the next four geological periods, uninterrupted by mountain building
979040	982600	or tectonic subsidence.
982600	987560	Over time the buried sediment got compressed and heated and formed sedimentary rock.
987560	993660	The organic matter trapped in the mud was also heated and broke down into simple hydrocarbons,
993660	996440	in other words oil and gas.
996440	1001440	The mud turned into shale, which is a flaky permeable rock.
1001440	1005440	Meanwhile on the other side of the continent was another stagnant sea covering much of
1005440	1008400	what's now the western part of North America.
1008400	1013920	Called the Permian Basin, it also collected organic matter buried in mud and sand that
1013920	1016360	turned into shale and sandstone.
1016360	1021860	This would eventually give us the oil shales and oil sands of the United States and Canada.
1021860	1026200	Towards the end of the Permian, molten rock and gas from the upper mantle forced its way
1026200	1031600	up through the crust in Siberia and released what's called a flood basalt.
1031600	1036200	It poured billions of tonnes of carbon dioxide back into the atmosphere, pushing temperatures
1036200	1041360	up again into hothouse conditions and another mass extinction followed.
1041360	1046960	This would mark the boundary of the Permian and the next geological period, the Triassic.
1046960	1052260	In this mass extinction, 95% of the species on Earth disappeared.
1052260	1056000	The Triassic is a rather boring period in geological terms.
1056000	1059440	There was little mountain building taking place because all the continents were now
1059440	1064120	joined into a supercontinent that stretched from pole to pole.
1064120	1068220	Even though the sun was weaker back then, the high levels of carbon dioxide ensured
1068220	1071620	it was way too hot for ice at either pole.
1071620	1076100	The hothouse produced featureless deserts and many of the rocks from that period are
1076100	1079480	characterised by red wind-blurned sands.
1079480	1084100	Most animals had gone extinct, so in the early Triassic there weren't even many fossils
1084100	1086660	to make the period interesting.
1086660	1091940	The mass extinction opened up opportunities for the survivors because every organism inhabits
1091940	1096500	a niche, a specialist role which can exploit resources.
1096500	1101580	So when a lot of niches are suddenly opened up, animals will evolve to fill them.
1101580	1107180	One of them was a tiny shrew-like burrowing animal that gave birth to live young and suckled
1107180	1110500	them, the ancestor of all mammals.
1110500	1113580	Another was an animal called the archosaur.
1113580	1118420	The Triassic ended with another mass extinction, although the cause of this is not yet well
1118420	1119880	understood.
1119880	1122620	The archosaurs survived that one too.
1122620	1127740	So when niches opened up at the start of the next period, the Jurassic, the archosaur filled
1127740	1134080	them by evolving into the most famous ancient animals of all, the dinosaurs.
1134080	1137340	During the Jurassic, Pangaea began to break apart.
1137340	1141960	A rift opened up between Norway and Greenland, and then the eastern seaboard of the United
1141960	1145100	States pulled away from West Africa.
1145100	1148020	This was the birth of the Atlantic Ocean.
1148020	1152980	In the western part of the Tethys Sea, Europe was just a patchwork of islands and crustal
1152980	1154460	plates.
1154460	1159300	Thick layers of limestone built up in these shallow seas millions of years later, providing
1159300	1163100	the building material for Europe's great cathedrals.
1163100	1166180	The limestone was also important for another reason.
1166180	1171260	In the Tethys Sea, a constant stream of organic material had been buried in mud since the
1171260	1172620	Permian.
1172620	1177740	As limestone and sandstone piled up on top, the pressure and heat turned the organic material
1177780	1181700	into oil and gas and the mud into shale.
1181700	1186340	The oil and gas worked its way up through these permeable and porous rocks until it
1186340	1193620	hit impermeable rock in folds and along fault lines, unconformities, and salt domes where
1193620	1200180	less dense layers of salt laid down by evaporating seas move upwards through denser rock.
1200180	1204060	These places where oil gets stuck because it can't move up any further are called
1204060	1206940	traps.
1207020	1210540	Tethys look for them by bouncing sound waves off the rocks below.
1210540	1216300	When they find them, the exploration drilling team goes in to see if the traps contain oil.
1216300	1220140	And in the Mediterranean and the North Sea, that was my job.
1220140	1223140	So why does the Middle East have so much oil?
1223140	1227140	Not only because over hundreds of millions of years the Tethys was a stable collecting
1227140	1232660	point for trillions of tonnes of dead organic matter, but also because the shales, limestones
1232660	1236460	and evaporites ensured that the Middle East was full of oil traps.
1236460	1242540	It's in the rock formations of the Triassic, Jurassic and Cretaceous that 70% of the modern
1242540	1244620	world's oil is found.
1244620	1248700	The plants and animals that formed this oil took their carbon dioxide from CO2 in the
1248700	1251660	atmosphere and of course buried it with them.
1251660	1256540	So once again carbon dioxide levels fell, helped by the background process of chemical
1256540	1260180	weathering that created the Jurassic limestone.
1260180	1264700	The falling concentration of CO2 lowered global temperature and took the Earth out
1264700	1266420	of its hothouse.
1266420	1271940	As Pangaea broke up, moisture and ocean winds penetrated the arid interior.
1271940	1277180	Conifer forests filled with ferns spread across the islands and continents.
1277180	1281860	The first dinosaurs to dominate this new landscape were the sauropods.
1281860	1286720	Contrary to Hollywood myth, the Jurassic wasn't the true age of the dinosaurs, they really
1286720	1290960	flourished during the next geological period, the Cretaceous.
1290960	1295940	This is where we get Tyrannosaurus rex and lots of other familiar dinosaurs.
1295940	1300640	The Cretaceous was also marked by a series of flood basalt events in India that poured
1300640	1304540	trillions of tonnes of carbon dioxide back into the air.
1304540	1308400	As CO2 concentrations rose, so did the temperature.
1308400	1312600	By the late Cretaceous, the Earth was in hothouse conditions again.
1313320	1318080	I often hear people point to the Cretaceous hothouse as a wonderful time when dinosaurs
1318080	1322000	flourished when there was thick forest and warm weather at the poles.
1322000	1325080	Wouldn't it be nice if the Earth was like that today?
1325080	1330360	Well, yes, there were large areas of natural forest during the Cretaceous, just as there
1330360	1332000	are today.
1332000	1336400	And of course with a warmer climate comes higher sea levels, exacerbated during the
1336400	1339180	Cretaceous by crustal movement.
1339180	1344340	With no water locked up in ice at the poles, and with warmer water expanding, the oceans
1344340	1349040	covered the Great Plains of North America and nearly all of Europe, the Middle East,
1349040	1351340	North Africa and Central Asia.
1351340	1357600	In fact the areas that cover most of today's farmland and population centres were underwater.
1357600	1361640	So perhaps it's not a climate we'd want to emulate.
1361640	1366420	In these warm seas, tiny plankton called coccolithophores thrived.
1366420	1371140	Their shells fell to the sea floor and built up a thick layer of chalk.
1371140	1375420	This is so much a characteristic rock of the period that the Cretaceous takes its name
1375420	1378360	from the Latin word for chalk.
1378360	1383660	The outpouring of gases and lava led to falling dinosaur's numbers and they were finally
1383660	1388980	killed off by a huge asteroid impact marking the end of the Cretaceous and the start of
1388980	1394300	the Tertiary, or the Paleogene and Neogene as they call it in the United States.
1395020	1400180	It's likely the only surviving dinosaurs were smaller, feathered species that most researchers
1400180	1402860	now conclude evolved into birds.
1402860	1409260	For the tiny burrowing mammals that also survived, the world was now full of vacant niches into
1409260	1411120	which they evolved.
1411120	1416000	The herds of large grazing dinosaurs were replaced by large grazing mammals.
1416000	1421800	The pack hunting carnivore dinosaurs were replaced by pack hunting carnivore mammals.
1422040	1426600	But how do we know that one group of animals replaced another, or that one group of animals
1426600	1428760	evolved into another?
1428760	1434520	The answer takes us back to the basic geological principle that newer sediment overlays older
1434520	1435520	sediment.
1435520	1437520	Let's look at an analogy.
1437520	1441880	Imagine there's a garbage dump outside Lincoln, California which was started when the town
1441880	1448020	was founded in 1890, about the time households began using telephones.
1448020	1453220	Within a few years, broken or discarded telephones would be thrown into the Lincoln garbage dump
1453220	1457740	in the same way dead animals fall to the bottom of the sea.
1457740	1460900	Over time, other garbage piles up on top.
1460900	1465440	As the telephone evolved into better and more efficient models, these got dumped on top
1465440	1468620	too, above the older ones.
1468620	1473460	Telephones dating from the 1920s are different again, so when they got thrown out they end
1473460	1475760	up here, and so on.
1475760	1481360	Through the 1940s, 50s and 60s, right up to the era of mobile phones.
1481360	1486240	But even mobile phones are evolving, and when older models get thrown away, they get buried
1486240	1488560	underneath newer models.
1488560	1493160	So if archaeologists 20,000 years from now uncover this garbage dump, they'll be able
1493160	1497640	to tell which telephones were older and which were newer, based on where they lie in the
1497640	1499120	strata.
1499120	1503900	So if the archaeologists found a pile of garbage elsewhere in California, they'd be able to
1503900	1509100	instantly place it in the chronology, based on the type of phone they find there.
1509100	1515860	Similarly, as a general principle, we get newer fossils lying on top of older ones.
1515860	1520580	So just like the phones, we can see small differences as these animals evolved over
1520580	1521820	time.
1521820	1526180	If I can date a rock which has a particular fossil in it, and I find another rock with
1526180	1530980	an identical fossil thousands of miles away, then there's a very good chance both rocks
1530980	1533360	are of the same age.
1533360	1538160	The breakup of Pangaea during the Cretaceous gave rise to another era of drifting continents
1538160	1541780	and continental collisions during the Tertiary.
1541780	1545740	India crashed into Asia, thrusting up the Himalayas.
1545740	1548920	Africa collided with Europe, pushing up the Alps.
1548920	1553680	The subduction of oceanic plates gave rise to the Andes Mountains and the mountains of
1553680	1556060	New Zealand and Japan.
1556060	1561440	This era of mountain building sped up chemical weathering that once again sucked carbon dioxide
1561440	1566480	out of the air, which cooled the Earth and sparked its fifth ice age, covering a period
1566480	1568940	called the Quaternary.
1568940	1573600	This is the shortest of our geological time periods, just one minute before now on our
1573600	1575080	time clock.
1575080	1578720	It wouldn't even rate a mention, except for the fact that it's the period we happen
1578720	1580680	to live in.
1580680	1584040	Our ice age isn't a uniform period of cold.
1584040	1588160	It's characterised by cycles called glaciations and interglacials.
1588160	1592440	The transition is sparked by tiny amounts of warming and cooling, as the Earth's tilt
1592440	1597760	and orbit regularly change the pattern of sunlight it receives.
1597760	1602000	Normally these orbital cycles make little difference to the temperature of the Earth,
1602000	1607720	but during an ice age, even the tiniest amount of warming and cooling gets amplified by what's
1607720	1610000	called positive feedback.
1610000	1614180	That's because a little bit of warming can melt a little bit of ice, reducing the amount
1614180	1618000	of sunlight it reflects, therefore amplifying the warming.
1618000	1622680	The melting of the ice unlocks methane from frozen soils, and a little bit of warming
1622680	1626780	causes the oceans to release carbon dioxide.
1626780	1630020	Both are powerful greenhouse gases.
1630020	1633720	During glaciations, much of the Earth's water is locked up in ice, and much of the
1633720	1638240	water that remains in the oceans is cold, so it shrinks.
1638240	1643620	During deglaciations, most of the ice melts and the warm waters expand, so sea levels
1643620	1649120	rose and fell by several hundred feet between glacial cycles.
1649120	1654020	Because of the regular cyclical nature of glacials and interglacials, a lot of posters
1654020	1659520	on my channel seem to believe that the Earth's geological history consists of cycles.
1659520	1663680	In nearly every case, it turns out that they are confusing different periods of geological
1663680	1667640	history, so let's put this in perspective.
1667640	1672600	This red dot represents the last 1000 years on the bottom timescale, and here's the
1672600	1678860	last 650,000 years, a third of our current ice age, comprising glacial and interglacial
1678860	1680940	cycles.
1680940	1685600	None of these orbital cycles affect the climate during your lifetime or mine.
1685600	1689940	They're on a scale of thousands of years, and the next time they begin sending us back
1689940	1695760	into another glaciation will be long after your great-great-great-great-great-grandchildren
1695760	1701380	have been dead and forgotten by their great-great-great-great-grandchildren.
1701380	1707580	And this is where the entire ice age stands in relation to the last 500 million years.
1707580	1713340	In relation to our geological clock, it's just one second out of eight hours, two million
1713340	1716140	years out of a billion.
1716140	1721760	For most of the last 500 million years, outside of these very short ice ages, orbital cycles
1721760	1727380	have no discernible influence on global temperature, because the changes in insolation they produce
1727380	1729360	are far too weak.
1729360	1735120	As for continental drift, flood basalt events, CO2 concentration, global temperature, solar
1735120	1741600	irradiance and other constantly changing features of the Earth, these don't follow regular cycles,
1741600	1744380	either in time or amplitude.
1744380	1749340	But no need to go to the other extreme and say that the whole system is chaotic either.
1749340	1754560	With the exception of flood basalts and continental rifting, the mechanisms which cause these
1754560	1757420	events are pretty well understood.
1757420	1762420	We know they follow basic principles of physics, we know that most of them are linked, and
1762420	1766180	in some cases they're even predictable.
1766180	1771300	So just to be clear, these glacial cycles aren't ice ages, and they don't represent
1771300	1773460	the Earth's geological history.
1773460	1778800	They're part of an ice age, and make up just one minute of the eight hours on our geological
1778800	1779800	clock.
1779800	1785860	It's a history that includes at least five ice ages, five mass extinctions and hundreds
1785860	1788220	of millions of years of hothouse.
1788220	1793500	Our Earth has experienced a world of deserts, a world devoid of plant life, a world of ice
1793500	1796500	and a world of water.
1796500	1801820	So here we are today, at one o'clock in the afternoon, in a warm interglacial that's
1801820	1808340	a pretty pleasant place to live, and has given rise to the civilisation we now enjoy.
1808340	1810180	And what of the future?
1810180	1815620	Well according to researchers, our interglacial should last about another 20,000 years, giving
1815620	1820420	us a benign climate and stable sea levels for thousands more generations.
1820420	1824080	Unless, of course, we stuff that up.
1824080	1828900	But tens of thousands of years is the blink of an eye in geological terms.
1828900	1834300	If we look tens of millions of years into the future, Australia will continue drifting
1834300	1840580	northwards, Africa will close the gap with Europe and squeeze out the Mediterranean Sea,
1840580	1843620	and the two American continents will separate.
1843620	1849260	250 million years from now, our mountain chains will have worn down, new ones will
1849260	1855020	have risen, and all the continents will be fused into yet another supercontinent.
1855020	1860100	This will be three o'clock in the afternoon on our geological clock.
1860100	1862780	Will our species survive until then?
1862780	1868740	Well the dinosaurs lasted 160 million years before going extinct, so if humans can survive
1868740	1872740	as long as that, the answer is no.
1872740	1878500	We won't be around 250 million years from now, but perhaps geologists of this future
1878500	1883540	world, whatever they look like, will develop the same technology we have to delve into
1883540	1884540	the past.
1884540	1890700	They'll notice a sharp rise in carbon dioxide, accompanied by a sharp rise in temperature
1890700	1893440	from our geological period.
1893440	1896940	But this time there won't be any flood basalts to explain it.
1896940	1902260	They'll dig through rocks uplifted and eroded over hundreds of millions of years and find
1902300	1907340	evidence of a sea level rise that buried strange geometric stones.
1907340	1913580	They'll see signs of the Earth's sixth mass extinction and a sudden disappearance of forests.
1913580	1921580	All this in the blink of an eye, 0.0005 seconds on our geological clock, which is actually
1921580	1925540	200 times faster than the blink of an eye.
1925540	1930500	And from time to time, since land fossils aren't as well preserved as marine fossils,
1930540	1935780	these future geologists will find bits of fossilized bone in the ancient rock that suggest
1935780	1939280	the presence of some kind of upright primate.
1939280	1941940	They'll no doubt wonder if there's any link.
1960500	1962580	you
