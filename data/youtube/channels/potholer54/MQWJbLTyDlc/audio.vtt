00:00.000 --> 00:05.180
I'm making this video because, as a former geologist turned science journalist, when

00:05.180 --> 00:09.580
I've tried to explain the Earth's history during discussions on my channel, people seem

00:09.580 --> 00:14.620
to be very confused about time scales and how all this happened.

00:14.620 --> 00:19.580
So in this video I'm going to show some basic geological principles and how they relate

00:19.580 --> 00:22.780
to the Earth's journey through the last billion years.

00:22.780 --> 00:27.420
I'll answer questions like why is there so much oil in the Middle East?

00:27.420 --> 00:30.880
How did geology help in the hunt for Osama bin Laden?

00:30.880 --> 00:33.900
How does the Ice Age fit into the Earth's history?

00:33.900 --> 00:39.980
What causes changes in climate and are there any cycles and patterns in all this?

00:39.980 --> 00:45.540
Let's first travel back through time to our starting point about a billion years ago.

00:45.540 --> 00:50.380
The Earth is a lot older than that and we can find rocks going back over three billion

00:50.380 --> 00:55.500
years, but a billion years ago is when things start getting interesting.

00:55.500 --> 01:00.300
We'll call this dawn, five o'clock in the morning, and end our journey at one o'clock

01:00.300 --> 01:03.540
in the afternoon, the present time.

01:03.540 --> 01:07.700
Then we'll go forward in time and see what will happen to the Earth 250 million years

01:07.700 --> 01:09.700
into the future.

01:09.700 --> 01:14.020
So each minute will represent about two million years.

01:14.020 --> 01:18.460
By the time we get to our starting point, the Earth's protocontinents have already been

01:18.460 --> 01:23.300
moving around for hundreds of millions of years, and a billion years ago most of them

01:23.300 --> 01:27.220
were joined into one supercontinent called Rodinia.

01:27.220 --> 01:31.820
The Earth's crust may be solid, but on a large scale it's very flexible.

01:31.820 --> 01:37.180
It's made of a number of plates, driven around by currents of molten rock in the upper mantle.

01:37.180 --> 01:41.700
Where thinner and denser oceanic plates made of basalt were driven against thicker and

01:41.700 --> 01:47.220
lighter continental plates made of granite, the denser plate got subducted.

01:47.220 --> 01:51.340
When that happened, the edge of the continent buckled and molten rock from the descending

01:51.340 --> 01:55.220
crust rose to form volcanic mountain chains.

01:55.220 --> 01:59.660
When the subducting oceanic crust ran out, the continents themselves would collide and

01:59.660 --> 02:03.220
fuse, throwing up mountain chains.

02:03.220 --> 02:07.860
Basalt and granite fit within one of three rock classifications, igneous rocks, in other

02:07.860 --> 02:11.740
words molten rock that's cooled and solidified.

02:11.740 --> 02:16.360
Where it cools slowly, the crystals have time to gravitate together, forming large-grained

02:16.360 --> 02:18.340
rocks like granite.

02:18.340 --> 02:23.320
Where the rock is cooled quickly, the crystals don't have time to grow so they're quite small,

02:23.320 --> 02:25.820
forming fine-grained rocks like basalt.

02:25.820 --> 02:30.340
A good rule of thumb is that the larger the grain size, the deeper underground and igneous

02:30.340 --> 02:32.420
rock has formed.

02:32.420 --> 02:35.640
Rodonia lasted for over 300 million years.

02:35.640 --> 02:40.300
There was no life on land, just clusters of single-celled organisms building structures

02:40.300 --> 02:44.720
called stromatolites in shallow seas near the shoreline.

02:44.720 --> 02:50.580
About 750 million years ago, Rodonia began breaking apart.

02:50.580 --> 02:54.680
The sea that opened up between North America and Australia became a dumping ground for

02:54.680 --> 02:59.580
sediments that would later get uplifted by another tectonic collision forming most of

02:59.580 --> 03:03.760
western Canada and the northwestern United States.

03:03.760 --> 03:08.540
This brings us to our first geological principle – uplift and erosion.

03:08.540 --> 03:13.220
Land masses get lifted up through crustal movements, then eroded through processes like

03:13.220 --> 03:14.860
chemical weathering.

03:14.860 --> 03:19.480
This reacts carbon dioxide in the air with silicates in the rocks and the eroded material

03:19.480 --> 03:25.320
is washed out to sea to form calcium carbonates, the main ingredient of limestone.

03:25.320 --> 03:29.520
It's an important process for the climate because over time it sucks carbon dioxide

03:29.520 --> 03:31.100
out of the air.

03:31.100 --> 03:36.080
Some of this limestone gets dragged down through subduction and melts, pumping CO2 back into

03:36.080 --> 03:38.380
the air through volcanoes.

03:38.400 --> 03:43.620
Fortunately for us, a lot of this carbon dioxide remains locked up in limestones today.

03:43.620 --> 03:48.720
There's also mechanical weathering which takes out large chunks of rock through processes

03:48.720 --> 03:55.640
like freeze and thaw or wind erosion and then grinds down the rock as it travels down rivers.

03:55.640 --> 04:00.420
The result is mud, silt, sand or pebbles according to grain size.

04:00.420 --> 04:05.440
These soft sediments build up around the continents, giving us our second principle of geology

04:05.440 --> 04:09.440
that older sediments tend to lie underneath younger ones.

04:09.440 --> 04:14.440
Hot water that ran through the sediments dissolved silica or calcium carbonate and then deposited

04:14.440 --> 04:18.240
it between grains, binding the grains together.

04:18.240 --> 04:22.860
Over millions of years this compression and cementation turned the sediments into solid

04:22.860 --> 04:27.480
rock like shales, siltstone, sandstone and limestone.

04:27.480 --> 04:30.520
These are known as sedimentary rocks.

04:30.520 --> 04:34.520
Look carefully and you can often detect the environment in which they formed.

04:34.520 --> 04:38.920
For example, cross-bedded sandstones show how ancient currents shifted.

04:38.920 --> 04:44.440
Bands of mud inside a sandstone may indicate the ebb and flow of a tidal estuary.

04:44.440 --> 04:48.800
Conglomerates formed from pebbles cemented together may indicate an ancient beach or

04:48.800 --> 04:50.200
a riverbed.

04:50.200 --> 04:55.080
They look almost identical to pebbly beaches and riverbeds we see today.

04:55.080 --> 05:00.200
And this brings us to our third geological principle, the present is the key to the past.

05:00.200 --> 05:04.500
If the features we see in the rocks are identical to the features we see today, it's strong

05:04.500 --> 05:08.100
evidence that they were formed by the same processes.

05:08.100 --> 05:13.460
For example, when molten lava is cooled quickly, it forms round lumps called pillow lavas,

05:13.460 --> 05:17.500
identical to structures found in ancient basils.

05:17.500 --> 05:21.460
This principle was brought home to me about 40 years ago when I was working for a diamond

05:21.460 --> 05:24.020
exploration company in northwest Australia.

05:24.020 --> 05:26.900
Yes, this really is me.

05:26.900 --> 05:31.860
Our helicopter was coming down onto an area of rippling sand and I expected a cloud of

05:31.860 --> 05:35.620
dust to come up as we landed, but there was none.

05:35.620 --> 05:39.380
When I stepped onto the sand, it was rock hard.

05:39.380 --> 05:43.980
It turned out that the ripples had been formed when this sand was part of a shallow pre-Cambrian

05:43.980 --> 05:47.620
bay over a billion years ago.

05:47.620 --> 05:51.800
If layers of igneous and sedimentary rock were buried very deeply, the pressure and

05:51.800 --> 05:57.040
heat was so great that they changed into the third type of rock, metamorphic.

05:57.040 --> 06:02.800
Over time, limestone became marble, shale became slate, sandstone became quartzite,

06:02.800 --> 06:04.720
mudstone became schist.

06:04.720 --> 06:09.560
The more pressure and heat that was applied, the greater the metamorphosis.

06:09.560 --> 06:15.380
The heat comes from reservoirs of molten rock rising from the upper mantle, rich in minerals.

06:15.380 --> 06:21.200
This intruded into weak points, often powerful enough to deform the sedimentary layers above.

06:21.200 --> 06:26.040
When the magma cooled and cracked, hot water surged through it, depositing minerals like

06:26.040 --> 06:30.080
silica and metals like gold.

06:30.080 --> 06:34.200
Metamorphic and igneous rocks are still being formed today, but several kilometres under

06:34.200 --> 06:36.160
the surface of the earth.

06:36.160 --> 06:40.920
The only way we can see rocks like these is if they have been uplifted and then the strata

06:40.920 --> 06:43.880
on top of them eroded away.

06:43.880 --> 06:47.520
Uplift and erosion, which takes hundreds of millions of years.

06:47.520 --> 06:52.680
So metamorphic and mineral-rich igneous rocks are predominantly found in the remnants of

06:52.680 --> 06:57.440
the Precambrian, in ancient areas known as cratonic blocks or shields.

06:57.440 --> 07:02.400
They're not only the oldest and most stable parts of the crust, they're also the richest

07:02.400 --> 07:04.400
in minerals.

07:04.400 --> 07:08.440
For a long time there was a paradox in this Precambrian world.

07:08.440 --> 07:13.680
Just like a real dawn, the sun was much weaker back then, so weak that the earth should have

07:13.680 --> 07:16.880
frozen over, and yet it didn't.

07:16.880 --> 07:21.700
Geologists have concluded that what kept the earth warm was a high concentration of methane

07:21.740 --> 07:25.540
and carbon dioxide, strong greenhouse gases.

07:25.540 --> 07:31.420
As the concentration of these fell, exacerbated by other factors such as continental configuration,

07:31.420 --> 07:36.340
temperatures began to drop and the earth went into an ice age.

07:36.340 --> 07:40.740
Not this ice age, the one with mammoths and sabre-toothed tigers that began a mere two

07:40.740 --> 07:45.660
million years ago, we're talking about the mother of all ice ages that occurred over

07:45.660 --> 07:51.580
700 million years ago, when almost the entire surface of the earth froze over.

07:51.580 --> 07:56.060
And because ice has a high albedo, in other words it's very reflective, what little

07:56.060 --> 07:59.780
sunlight there was got reflected back into space.

07:59.780 --> 08:04.020
So the earth might have stayed frozen if it wasn't for one thing.

08:04.020 --> 08:08.800
Over a hundred million years, volcanoes under the ice continued pouring trillions of tonnes

08:08.800 --> 08:12.320
of carbon dioxide back into the atmosphere.

08:12.320 --> 08:16.740
This time there was no weathering process to wash it out, so the carbon dioxide kept

08:16.740 --> 08:21.620
accumulating until it reached levels 20 times higher than today.

08:21.620 --> 08:25.740
It acted like a blanket and trapped what little heat was coming in.

08:25.740 --> 08:31.860
That started to melt the ice, reducing the albedo and warmed the earth even further.

08:31.860 --> 08:36.860
Eventually the earth thawed out, and because CO2 levels were still very high, temperatures

08:36.860 --> 08:41.220
continued climbing until the earth became a hot house with average global temperature

08:41.220 --> 08:46.900
of around 70°F, about 13°C higher than today.

08:46.900 --> 08:49.660
Coral reefs grew near the North Pole.

08:49.660 --> 08:53.940
As we'll see throughout the earth's history, this link between carbon dioxide and global

08:53.940 --> 08:59.420
temperature is so crucial that carbon dioxide has been called the earth's thermostat.

08:59.420 --> 09:02.900
We're now in a period called the Cambrian.

09:02.900 --> 09:07.340
Most of the continents were once again bunched together into a supercontinent, this one's

09:07.340 --> 09:12.100
called Gondwanaland, although by the start of the Cambrian pieces of it had already begun

09:12.100 --> 09:13.660
to break away.

09:13.660 --> 09:19.060
An ancient ocean called the Iapetus was subducting under one of these pieces, the continent of

09:19.060 --> 09:20.740
Laurentia.

09:20.740 --> 09:26.160
Trillions of tonnes of sediment washed into the depression between the two crustal plates.

09:26.160 --> 09:31.340
The land was still devoid of life, but in the oceans life now flourished.

09:31.340 --> 09:36.680
Cambrian fossils show a huge divergence of body types, possibly because of rapid evolution,

09:36.680 --> 09:42.340
the so-called Cambrian explosion, or possibly because animals had evolved hard body parts,

09:42.340 --> 09:45.680
which fossilised more easily.

09:45.680 --> 09:50.720
During the next geological period, the Ordovician, the Iapetus Ocean closed.

09:50.720 --> 09:56.300
Laurentia collided with a smaller continent called Avalonia, and then the mini-continent

09:56.300 --> 09:57.740
of Baltica.

09:57.740 --> 10:04.120
The series of collisions threw up a huge mountain chain as big and impressive as the Alps today.

10:04.120 --> 10:08.400
The granite bulk of the continents and the thick band of ocean sediments in between them

10:08.400 --> 10:10.040
were thrust upwards.

10:10.040 --> 10:13.760
Scotland, which had been part of Laurentia, was fused to England.

10:13.760 --> 10:16.920
Yes, to all Scots out there, I feel your pain.

10:16.920 --> 10:22.760
Connecticut was fused to New York, and a new continent called Euramerica was created.

10:22.760 --> 10:27.540
But as we'll see, it was pulled apart again hundreds of millions of years later.

10:27.540 --> 10:31.520
The remnants of this crustal collision can still be found in the eastern part of the

10:31.520 --> 10:35.600
North American continent and parts of northwest Europe.

10:35.600 --> 10:40.840
The rise of the mountain chain increased weathering, because high altitude rocks are more exposed

10:40.840 --> 10:42.560
and weather faster.

10:42.560 --> 10:47.040
And because CO2 is used in the weathering process, this reduced the concentration of

10:47.040 --> 10:52.880
CO2 in the atmosphere, lowered the temperature and triggered another ice age.

10:52.880 --> 10:56.840
Unlike Snowball Earth, this ice age lasted only a few million years.

10:56.840 --> 11:02.400
It was centred on what's now the Sahara Desert and covered much of Gondwanaland.

11:02.400 --> 11:06.100
The new continent of Euramerica was further north.

11:06.100 --> 11:11.560
As water got locked up in ice, and because water shrinks in volume as it cools, sea levels

11:11.560 --> 11:12.880
fell.

11:12.880 --> 11:17.440
Geologists think the retreating coastline had a major impact on marine life and may

11:17.440 --> 11:23.320
have contributed to the Earth's first mass extinction at the end of the Ordovician.

11:23.320 --> 11:27.520
As CO2 levels climbed again, they pushed temperatures back up.

11:27.520 --> 11:32.880
During the Silurian period, the Earth was once again a hothouse and sea levels rose.

11:32.880 --> 11:39.080
The oceans covered Ordovician rocks that had been exposed and eroded over millions of years.

11:39.080 --> 11:44.240
Ordinarily one layer of sediment gets laid down on top of an older one in sequence, but

11:44.240 --> 11:50.880
when the sea retreats or the land gets uplifted out of the water, that process stops.

11:50.880 --> 11:56.120
Seats may be exposed and eroded, even faltered and folded, over millions of years, so when

11:56.120 --> 12:02.560
the sea covers them again and lays down new sediment, you get what's called an unconformity.

12:02.560 --> 12:04.840
Which leads me to Bin Laden.

12:04.840 --> 12:10.080
In 2001 I was watching the news and a video from Osama Bin Laden was played in which he

12:10.080 --> 12:13.200
stood in front of a distinctive rock formation.

12:13.200 --> 12:18.240
I'm not a sedimentologist, but the fuzzy image looked like a shale or a limestone sitting

12:18.240 --> 12:20.680
on top of an unconformity.

12:20.680 --> 12:25.040
Surely I thought the intelligence services can figure out where that is.

12:25.040 --> 12:30.480
And sure enough, a few weeks later a geologist who'd done some exploration work in Afghanistan

12:30.480 --> 12:36.240
said he knew exactly where that was and passed the information on to the CIA.

12:36.240 --> 12:41.360
From then on Bin Laden delivered his Death to America speeches in front of a plain cloth

12:41.360 --> 12:43.360
background.

12:43.360 --> 12:48.400
But getting back to the Silurian, the Silurian is also notable as a period when land plants

12:48.400 --> 12:52.080
evolved and spread across the continents.

12:52.080 --> 12:56.400
A few hundred million years later, during the Devonian, sea-based insects and animals

12:56.400 --> 13:02.500
also started venturing onto the land and fish became the dominant species of the oceans.

13:02.500 --> 13:08.280
The mosses and lichens of the Silurian evolved into bushes that put down deep roots and weren't

13:08.280 --> 13:11.560
dependent on surface water to survive.

13:11.560 --> 13:14.720
And so they expanded across the continents.

13:14.720 --> 13:19.120
And as they did so, they sucked out carbon dioxide from the atmosphere and that once

13:19.120 --> 13:20.840
again cooled the earth.

13:20.840 --> 13:25.840
It's possible this cooling helped contribute to a mass extinction in the oceans, the earth's

13:25.840 --> 13:28.540
second mass extinction.

13:28.540 --> 13:33.000
The cooling continued into the next geological period, the Carboniferous.

13:33.000 --> 13:36.280
And with a cooler earth came retreating sea levels.

13:36.280 --> 13:39.920
Shallow seas and swamps were left behind.

13:39.920 --> 13:44.560
The wandering continents of Gondwanaland and Euramerica came together again to form a

13:44.560 --> 13:47.680
another supercontinent, Pangaea.

13:47.680 --> 13:53.040
West Africa collided with the eastern seaboard of North America and the Appalachian Mountains,

13:53.040 --> 13:57.800
which had first risen during the Ordovician and been worn down, were again buckled and

13:57.800 --> 14:01.720
uplifted like the crumple zone of a car crash.

14:01.720 --> 14:06.440
Bushes evolved into the first trees and huge forests covered the swamps.

14:06.440 --> 14:11.560
Fish that could use their fins as limbs to negotiate the roots and stems gained an evolutionary

14:11.560 --> 14:16.820
advantage in the hunt for food and evolved into the first tetrapods, four-legged animals

14:16.820 --> 14:21.140
that were the forerunners of lizards, dinosaurs and mammals.

14:21.140 --> 14:25.980
The proliferation of plant life increased the oxygen content of the atmosphere.

14:25.980 --> 14:30.600
Because insects absorb oxygen through their skin, that allowed them to grow to enormous

14:30.600 --> 14:32.180
size.

14:32.180 --> 14:36.680
But as well as releasing oxygen, the forests also took in huge amounts of carbon dioxide

14:36.680 --> 14:38.640
in order to grow.

14:38.640 --> 14:43.940
Only that carbon would be released back into the atmosphere when the trees died and decayed.

14:43.940 --> 14:48.920
But during the Carboniferous, the vegetation sank into shallow swamps where oxygen levels

14:48.920 --> 14:52.640
were low and didn't decompose.

14:52.640 --> 14:57.000
After millions of years of compression and heating, these layers of wood and vegetation

14:57.000 --> 14:59.360
turned into coal seams.

14:59.360 --> 15:04.200
This paleomap of the Carboniferous in Europe shows how the shallow water coincides with

15:04.200 --> 15:10.080
the coal fields of Germany, Britain, Poland and Northern France.

15:10.080 --> 15:15.300
The falling carbon dioxide concentration cooled the earth so much that it once again triggered

15:15.300 --> 15:17.080
an ice age.

15:17.080 --> 15:22.560
Sea levels dropped even further and the Carboniferous swamp forests began to disappear.

15:22.560 --> 15:27.320
The tetrapods of the Carboniferous had evolved into a weird looking clade of reptiles called

15:27.320 --> 15:33.360
synapsids and were still a long time before the appearance of the dinosaurs.

15:33.360 --> 15:39.320
The supercontinent Pangaea was now so large that rain clouds rarely penetrated the interior,

15:39.320 --> 15:41.640
creating huge deserts.

15:41.640 --> 15:46.080
Offshore a ring of smaller continents enclosed a sea called the Tethys that would have a

15:46.080 --> 15:51.080
profound effect on our economy 250 million years later.

15:51.080 --> 15:55.000
Algae and plankton thrived in this warm tropical sea.

15:55.000 --> 15:59.280
When they died, they fell to the bottom and got buried in mud.

15:59.280 --> 16:04.040
There was only a weak circulation system in the Tethys, a bit like the Black Sea today,

16:04.040 --> 16:09.240
so organic matter didn't decay in the stagnant oxygen-free depths.

16:09.240 --> 16:13.640
This build-up of organic sediment in the Tethys would continue for hundreds of millions of

16:13.640 --> 16:19.040
years throughout the next four geological periods, uninterrupted by mountain building

16:19.040 --> 16:22.600
or tectonic subsidence.

16:22.600 --> 16:27.560
Over time the buried sediment got compressed and heated and formed sedimentary rock.

16:27.560 --> 16:33.660
The organic matter trapped in the mud was also heated and broke down into simple hydrocarbons,

16:33.660 --> 16:36.440
in other words oil and gas.

16:36.440 --> 16:41.440
The mud turned into shale, which is a flaky permeable rock.

16:41.440 --> 16:45.440
Meanwhile on the other side of the continent was another stagnant sea covering much of

16:45.440 --> 16:48.400
what's now the western part of North America.

16:48.400 --> 16:53.920
Called the Permian Basin, it also collected organic matter buried in mud and sand that

16:53.920 --> 16:56.360
turned into shale and sandstone.

16:56.360 --> 17:01.860
This would eventually give us the oil shales and oil sands of the United States and Canada.

17:01.860 --> 17:06.200
Towards the end of the Permian, molten rock and gas from the upper mantle forced its way

17:06.200 --> 17:11.600
up through the crust in Siberia and released what's called a flood basalt.

17:11.600 --> 17:16.200
It poured billions of tonnes of carbon dioxide back into the atmosphere, pushing temperatures

17:16.200 --> 17:21.360
up again into hothouse conditions and another mass extinction followed.

17:21.360 --> 17:26.960
This would mark the boundary of the Permian and the next geological period, the Triassic.

17:26.960 --> 17:32.260
In this mass extinction, 95% of the species on Earth disappeared.

17:32.260 --> 17:36.000
The Triassic is a rather boring period in geological terms.

17:36.000 --> 17:39.440
There was little mountain building taking place because all the continents were now

17:39.440 --> 17:44.120
joined into a supercontinent that stretched from pole to pole.

17:44.120 --> 17:48.220
Even though the sun was weaker back then, the high levels of carbon dioxide ensured

17:48.220 --> 17:51.620
it was way too hot for ice at either pole.

17:51.620 --> 17:56.100
The hothouse produced featureless deserts and many of the rocks from that period are

17:56.100 --> 17:59.480
characterised by red wind-blurned sands.

17:59.480 --> 18:04.100
Most animals had gone extinct, so in the early Triassic there weren't even many fossils

18:04.100 --> 18:06.660
to make the period interesting.

18:06.660 --> 18:11.940
The mass extinction opened up opportunities for the survivors because every organism inhabits

18:11.940 --> 18:16.500
a niche, a specialist role which can exploit resources.

18:16.500 --> 18:21.580
So when a lot of niches are suddenly opened up, animals will evolve to fill them.

18:21.580 --> 18:27.180
One of them was a tiny shrew-like burrowing animal that gave birth to live young and suckled

18:27.180 --> 18:30.500
them, the ancestor of all mammals.

18:30.500 --> 18:33.580
Another was an animal called the archosaur.

18:33.580 --> 18:38.420
The Triassic ended with another mass extinction, although the cause of this is not yet well

18:38.420 --> 18:39.880
understood.

18:39.880 --> 18:42.620
The archosaurs survived that one too.

18:42.620 --> 18:47.740
So when niches opened up at the start of the next period, the Jurassic, the archosaur filled

18:47.740 --> 18:54.080
them by evolving into the most famous ancient animals of all, the dinosaurs.

18:54.080 --> 18:57.340
During the Jurassic, Pangaea began to break apart.

18:57.340 --> 19:01.960
A rift opened up between Norway and Greenland, and then the eastern seaboard of the United

19:01.960 --> 19:05.100
States pulled away from West Africa.

19:05.100 --> 19:08.020
This was the birth of the Atlantic Ocean.

19:08.020 --> 19:12.980
In the western part of the Tethys Sea, Europe was just a patchwork of islands and crustal

19:12.980 --> 19:14.460
plates.

19:14.460 --> 19:19.300
Thick layers of limestone built up in these shallow seas millions of years later, providing

19:19.300 --> 19:23.100
the building material for Europe's great cathedrals.

19:23.100 --> 19:26.180
The limestone was also important for another reason.

19:26.180 --> 19:31.260
In the Tethys Sea, a constant stream of organic material had been buried in mud since the

19:31.260 --> 19:32.620
Permian.

19:32.620 --> 19:37.740
As limestone and sandstone piled up on top, the pressure and heat turned the organic material

19:37.780 --> 19:41.700
into oil and gas and the mud into shale.

19:41.700 --> 19:46.340
The oil and gas worked its way up through these permeable and porous rocks until it

19:46.340 --> 19:53.620
hit impermeable rock in folds and along fault lines, unconformities, and salt domes where

19:53.620 --> 20:00.180
less dense layers of salt laid down by evaporating seas move upwards through denser rock.

20:00.180 --> 20:04.060
These places where oil gets stuck because it can't move up any further are called

20:04.060 --> 20:06.940
traps.

20:07.020 --> 20:10.540
Tethys look for them by bouncing sound waves off the rocks below.

20:10.540 --> 20:16.300
When they find them, the exploration drilling team goes in to see if the traps contain oil.

20:16.300 --> 20:20.140
And in the Mediterranean and the North Sea, that was my job.

20:20.140 --> 20:23.140
So why does the Middle East have so much oil?

20:23.140 --> 20:27.140
Not only because over hundreds of millions of years the Tethys was a stable collecting

20:27.140 --> 20:32.660
point for trillions of tonnes of dead organic matter, but also because the shales, limestones

20:32.660 --> 20:36.460
and evaporites ensured that the Middle East was full of oil traps.

20:36.460 --> 20:42.540
It's in the rock formations of the Triassic, Jurassic and Cretaceous that 70% of the modern

20:42.540 --> 20:44.620
world's oil is found.

20:44.620 --> 20:48.700
The plants and animals that formed this oil took their carbon dioxide from CO2 in the

20:48.700 --> 20:51.660
atmosphere and of course buried it with them.

20:51.660 --> 20:56.540
So once again carbon dioxide levels fell, helped by the background process of chemical

20:56.540 --> 21:00.180
weathering that created the Jurassic limestone.

21:00.180 --> 21:04.700
The falling concentration of CO2 lowered global temperature and took the Earth out

21:04.700 --> 21:06.420
of its hothouse.

21:06.420 --> 21:11.940
As Pangaea broke up, moisture and ocean winds penetrated the arid interior.

21:11.940 --> 21:17.180
Conifer forests filled with ferns spread across the islands and continents.

21:17.180 --> 21:21.860
The first dinosaurs to dominate this new landscape were the sauropods.

21:21.860 --> 21:26.720
Contrary to Hollywood myth, the Jurassic wasn't the true age of the dinosaurs, they really

21:26.720 --> 21:30.960
flourished during the next geological period, the Cretaceous.

21:30.960 --> 21:35.940
This is where we get Tyrannosaurus rex and lots of other familiar dinosaurs.

21:35.940 --> 21:40.640
The Cretaceous was also marked by a series of flood basalt events in India that poured

21:40.640 --> 21:44.540
trillions of tonnes of carbon dioxide back into the air.

21:44.540 --> 21:48.400
As CO2 concentrations rose, so did the temperature.

21:48.400 --> 21:52.600
By the late Cretaceous, the Earth was in hothouse conditions again.

21:53.320 --> 21:58.080
I often hear people point to the Cretaceous hothouse as a wonderful time when dinosaurs

21:58.080 --> 22:02.000
flourished when there was thick forest and warm weather at the poles.

22:02.000 --> 22:05.080
Wouldn't it be nice if the Earth was like that today?

22:05.080 --> 22:10.360
Well, yes, there were large areas of natural forest during the Cretaceous, just as there

22:10.360 --> 22:12.000
are today.

22:12.000 --> 22:16.400
And of course with a warmer climate comes higher sea levels, exacerbated during the

22:16.400 --> 22:19.180
Cretaceous by crustal movement.

22:19.180 --> 22:24.340
With no water locked up in ice at the poles, and with warmer water expanding, the oceans

22:24.340 --> 22:29.040
covered the Great Plains of North America and nearly all of Europe, the Middle East,

22:29.040 --> 22:31.340
North Africa and Central Asia.

22:31.340 --> 22:37.600
In fact the areas that cover most of today's farmland and population centres were underwater.

22:37.600 --> 22:41.640
So perhaps it's not a climate we'd want to emulate.

22:41.640 --> 22:46.420
In these warm seas, tiny plankton called coccolithophores thrived.

22:46.420 --> 22:51.140
Their shells fell to the sea floor and built up a thick layer of chalk.

22:51.140 --> 22:55.420
This is so much a characteristic rock of the period that the Cretaceous takes its name

22:55.420 --> 22:58.360
from the Latin word for chalk.

22:58.360 --> 23:03.660
The outpouring of gases and lava led to falling dinosaur's numbers and they were finally

23:03.660 --> 23:08.980
killed off by a huge asteroid impact marking the end of the Cretaceous and the start of

23:08.980 --> 23:14.300
the Tertiary, or the Paleogene and Neogene as they call it in the United States.

23:15.020 --> 23:20.180
It's likely the only surviving dinosaurs were smaller, feathered species that most researchers

23:20.180 --> 23:22.860
now conclude evolved into birds.

23:22.860 --> 23:29.260
For the tiny burrowing mammals that also survived, the world was now full of vacant niches into

23:29.260 --> 23:31.120
which they evolved.

23:31.120 --> 23:36.000
The herds of large grazing dinosaurs were replaced by large grazing mammals.

23:36.000 --> 23:41.800
The pack hunting carnivore dinosaurs were replaced by pack hunting carnivore mammals.

23:42.040 --> 23:46.600
But how do we know that one group of animals replaced another, or that one group of animals

23:46.600 --> 23:48.760
evolved into another?

23:48.760 --> 23:54.520
The answer takes us back to the basic geological principle that newer sediment overlays older

23:54.520 --> 23:55.520
sediment.

23:55.520 --> 23:57.520
Let's look at an analogy.

23:57.520 --> 24:01.880
Imagine there's a garbage dump outside Lincoln, California which was started when the town

24:01.880 --> 24:08.020
was founded in 1890, about the time households began using telephones.

24:08.020 --> 24:13.220
Within a few years, broken or discarded telephones would be thrown into the Lincoln garbage dump

24:13.220 --> 24:17.740
in the same way dead animals fall to the bottom of the sea.

24:17.740 --> 24:20.900
Over time, other garbage piles up on top.

24:20.900 --> 24:25.440
As the telephone evolved into better and more efficient models, these got dumped on top

24:25.440 --> 24:28.620
too, above the older ones.

24:28.620 --> 24:33.460
Telephones dating from the 1920s are different again, so when they got thrown out they end

24:33.460 --> 24:35.760
up here, and so on.

24:35.760 --> 24:41.360
Through the 1940s, 50s and 60s, right up to the era of mobile phones.

24:41.360 --> 24:46.240
But even mobile phones are evolving, and when older models get thrown away, they get buried

24:46.240 --> 24:48.560
underneath newer models.

24:48.560 --> 24:53.160
So if archaeologists 20,000 years from now uncover this garbage dump, they'll be able

24:53.160 --> 24:57.640
to tell which telephones were older and which were newer, based on where they lie in the

24:57.640 --> 24:59.120
strata.

24:59.120 --> 25:03.900
So if the archaeologists found a pile of garbage elsewhere in California, they'd be able to

25:03.900 --> 25:09.100
instantly place it in the chronology, based on the type of phone they find there.

25:09.100 --> 25:15.860
Similarly, as a general principle, we get newer fossils lying on top of older ones.

25:15.860 --> 25:20.580
So just like the phones, we can see small differences as these animals evolved over

25:20.580 --> 25:21.820
time.

25:21.820 --> 25:26.180
If I can date a rock which has a particular fossil in it, and I find another rock with

25:26.180 --> 25:30.980
an identical fossil thousands of miles away, then there's a very good chance both rocks

25:30.980 --> 25:33.360
are of the same age.

25:33.360 --> 25:38.160
The breakup of Pangaea during the Cretaceous gave rise to another era of drifting continents

25:38.160 --> 25:41.780
and continental collisions during the Tertiary.

25:41.780 --> 25:45.740
India crashed into Asia, thrusting up the Himalayas.

25:45.740 --> 25:48.920
Africa collided with Europe, pushing up the Alps.

25:48.920 --> 25:53.680
The subduction of oceanic plates gave rise to the Andes Mountains and the mountains of

25:53.680 --> 25:56.060
New Zealand and Japan.

25:56.060 --> 26:01.440
This era of mountain building sped up chemical weathering that once again sucked carbon dioxide

26:01.440 --> 26:06.480
out of the air, which cooled the Earth and sparked its fifth ice age, covering a period

26:06.480 --> 26:08.940
called the Quaternary.

26:08.940 --> 26:13.600
This is the shortest of our geological time periods, just one minute before now on our

26:13.600 --> 26:15.080
time clock.

26:15.080 --> 26:18.720
It wouldn't even rate a mention, except for the fact that it's the period we happen

26:18.720 --> 26:20.680
to live in.

26:20.680 --> 26:24.040
Our ice age isn't a uniform period of cold.

26:24.040 --> 26:28.160
It's characterised by cycles called glaciations and interglacials.

26:28.160 --> 26:32.440
The transition is sparked by tiny amounts of warming and cooling, as the Earth's tilt

26:32.440 --> 26:37.760
and orbit regularly change the pattern of sunlight it receives.

26:37.760 --> 26:42.000
Normally these orbital cycles make little difference to the temperature of the Earth,

26:42.000 --> 26:47.720
but during an ice age, even the tiniest amount of warming and cooling gets amplified by what's

26:47.720 --> 26:50.000
called positive feedback.

26:50.000 --> 26:54.180
That's because a little bit of warming can melt a little bit of ice, reducing the amount

26:54.180 --> 26:58.000
of sunlight it reflects, therefore amplifying the warming.

26:58.000 --> 27:02.680
The melting of the ice unlocks methane from frozen soils, and a little bit of warming

27:02.680 --> 27:06.780
causes the oceans to release carbon dioxide.

27:06.780 --> 27:10.020
Both are powerful greenhouse gases.

27:10.020 --> 27:13.720
During glaciations, much of the Earth's water is locked up in ice, and much of the

27:13.720 --> 27:18.240
water that remains in the oceans is cold, so it shrinks.

27:18.240 --> 27:23.620
During deglaciations, most of the ice melts and the warm waters expand, so sea levels

27:23.620 --> 27:29.120
rose and fell by several hundred feet between glacial cycles.

27:29.120 --> 27:34.020
Because of the regular cyclical nature of glacials and interglacials, a lot of posters

27:34.020 --> 27:39.520
on my channel seem to believe that the Earth's geological history consists of cycles.

27:39.520 --> 27:43.680
In nearly every case, it turns out that they are confusing different periods of geological

27:43.680 --> 27:47.640
history, so let's put this in perspective.

27:47.640 --> 27:52.600
This red dot represents the last 1000 years on the bottom timescale, and here's the

27:52.600 --> 27:58.860
last 650,000 years, a third of our current ice age, comprising glacial and interglacial

27:58.860 --> 28:00.940
cycles.

28:00.940 --> 28:05.600
None of these orbital cycles affect the climate during your lifetime or mine.

28:05.600 --> 28:09.940
They're on a scale of thousands of years, and the next time they begin sending us back

28:09.940 --> 28:15.760
into another glaciation will be long after your great-great-great-great-great-grandchildren

28:15.760 --> 28:21.380
have been dead and forgotten by their great-great-great-great-grandchildren.

28:21.380 --> 28:27.580
And this is where the entire ice age stands in relation to the last 500 million years.

28:27.580 --> 28:33.340
In relation to our geological clock, it's just one second out of eight hours, two million

28:33.340 --> 28:36.140
years out of a billion.

28:36.140 --> 28:41.760
For most of the last 500 million years, outside of these very short ice ages, orbital cycles

28:41.760 --> 28:47.380
have no discernible influence on global temperature, because the changes in insolation they produce

28:47.380 --> 28:49.360
are far too weak.

28:49.360 --> 28:55.120
As for continental drift, flood basalt events, CO2 concentration, global temperature, solar

28:55.120 --> 29:01.600
irradiance and other constantly changing features of the Earth, these don't follow regular cycles,

29:01.600 --> 29:04.380
either in time or amplitude.

29:04.380 --> 29:09.340
But no need to go to the other extreme and say that the whole system is chaotic either.

29:09.340 --> 29:14.560
With the exception of flood basalts and continental rifting, the mechanisms which cause these

29:14.560 --> 29:17.420
events are pretty well understood.

29:17.420 --> 29:22.420
We know they follow basic principles of physics, we know that most of them are linked, and

29:22.420 --> 29:26.180
in some cases they're even predictable.

29:26.180 --> 29:31.300
So just to be clear, these glacial cycles aren't ice ages, and they don't represent

29:31.300 --> 29:33.460
the Earth's geological history.

29:33.460 --> 29:38.800
They're part of an ice age, and make up just one minute of the eight hours on our geological

29:38.800 --> 29:39.800
clock.

29:39.800 --> 29:45.860
It's a history that includes at least five ice ages, five mass extinctions and hundreds

29:45.860 --> 29:48.220
of millions of years of hothouse.

29:48.220 --> 29:53.500
Our Earth has experienced a world of deserts, a world devoid of plant life, a world of ice

29:53.500 --> 29:56.500
and a world of water.

29:56.500 --> 30:01.820
So here we are today, at one o'clock in the afternoon, in a warm interglacial that's

30:01.820 --> 30:08.340
a pretty pleasant place to live, and has given rise to the civilisation we now enjoy.

30:08.340 --> 30:10.180
And what of the future?

30:10.180 --> 30:15.620
Well according to researchers, our interglacial should last about another 20,000 years, giving

30:15.620 --> 30:20.420
us a benign climate and stable sea levels for thousands more generations.

30:20.420 --> 30:24.080
Unless, of course, we stuff that up.

30:24.080 --> 30:28.900
But tens of thousands of years is the blink of an eye in geological terms.

30:28.900 --> 30:34.300
If we look tens of millions of years into the future, Australia will continue drifting

30:34.300 --> 30:40.580
northwards, Africa will close the gap with Europe and squeeze out the Mediterranean Sea,

30:40.580 --> 30:43.620
and the two American continents will separate.

30:43.620 --> 30:49.260
250 million years from now, our mountain chains will have worn down, new ones will

30:49.260 --> 30:55.020
have risen, and all the continents will be fused into yet another supercontinent.

30:55.020 --> 31:00.100
This will be three o'clock in the afternoon on our geological clock.

31:00.100 --> 31:02.780
Will our species survive until then?

31:02.780 --> 31:08.740
Well the dinosaurs lasted 160 million years before going extinct, so if humans can survive

31:08.740 --> 31:12.740
as long as that, the answer is no.

31:12.740 --> 31:18.500
We won't be around 250 million years from now, but perhaps geologists of this future

31:18.500 --> 31:23.540
world, whatever they look like, will develop the same technology we have to delve into

31:23.540 --> 31:24.540
the past.

31:24.540 --> 31:30.700
They'll notice a sharp rise in carbon dioxide, accompanied by a sharp rise in temperature

31:30.700 --> 31:33.440
from our geological period.

31:33.440 --> 31:36.940
But this time there won't be any flood basalts to explain it.

31:36.940 --> 31:42.260
They'll dig through rocks uplifted and eroded over hundreds of millions of years and find

31:42.300 --> 31:47.340
evidence of a sea level rise that buried strange geometric stones.

31:47.340 --> 31:53.580
They'll see signs of the Earth's sixth mass extinction and a sudden disappearance of forests.

31:53.580 --> 32:01.580
All this in the blink of an eye, 0.0005 seconds on our geological clock, which is actually

32:01.580 --> 32:05.540
200 times faster than the blink of an eye.

32:05.540 --> 32:10.500
And from time to time, since land fossils aren't as well preserved as marine fossils,

32:10.540 --> 32:15.780
these future geologists will find bits of fossilized bone in the ancient rock that suggest

32:15.780 --> 32:19.280
the presence of some kind of upright primate.

32:19.280 --> 32:21.940
They'll no doubt wonder if there's any link.

32:40.500 --> 32:42.580
you
