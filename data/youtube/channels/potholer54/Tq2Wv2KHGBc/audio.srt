00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,160
A few months ago I started having a video debate with a guy named Potholler, who had

2
00:00:05,160 --> 00:00:08,440
made some utterly ludicrous assertions in his videos.

3
00:00:08,440 --> 00:00:12,960
Well one thing's true, we were having a great debate, and I'm very happy to link

4
00:00:12,960 --> 00:00:17,920
the debate in the video description so you can judge for yourselves. Tony opened the

5
00:00:17,920 --> 00:00:23,880
debate by making these claims, which I listed in my opening response. And then I provided

6
00:00:23,880 --> 00:00:29,240
clear evidence that disproved each and every one, either by checking Tony's sources and

7
00:00:29,240 --> 00:00:34,720
how he misread them, or showing things that he claimed didn't exist, or challenging

8
00:00:34,720 --> 00:00:40,080
his misquotes by asking for video clips that he couldn't provide, or contradicting his

9
00:00:40,080 --> 00:00:46,200
claims with actual facts and figures, which is how science debates are supposed to work.

10
00:00:46,200 --> 00:00:50,280
After only three rounds of this, Tony refused to continue.

11
00:00:50,280 --> 00:00:55,440
So I'm delighted to see that eight months on he's finally rejoined the debate, a week

12
00:00:55,440 --> 00:00:59,920
before I was due to fly home in fact, so he's just in time.

13
00:00:59,920 --> 00:01:04,200
I got back a couple of days ago, so I can now post my response.

14
00:01:04,200 --> 00:01:09,800
So let's take a look at his latest rebuttal.

15
00:01:09,800 --> 00:01:14,120
Hold on, as I've said before, personal insults aren't helpful, and they don't shed any

16
00:01:14,120 --> 00:01:19,300
light on who's correctly reporting the facts. I'm going to maintain this debate as a debate

17
00:01:19,300 --> 00:01:24,200
about science, not who can produce the most offensive personal insult.

18
00:01:24,200 --> 00:01:29,320
But before we go on to what I actually said, let's start with what Tony claims I said

19
00:01:29,320 --> 00:01:33,760
using illustrations from my video that address the point he's making.

20
00:01:33,760 --> 00:01:38,840
So potholars arguing boils down to the idea that a little tiny nudge caused by changes

21
00:01:38,840 --> 00:01:42,480
in orbital cycles starts and ends ice ages.

22
00:01:42,480 --> 00:01:47,520
Tony's misquote is what's known as a straw man, invent something completely ridiculous,

23
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:51,880
claim the other person said it, and then masterfully demolish it.

24
00:01:51,880 --> 00:01:57,120
So let's go with what I actually said, rather than what Tony wishes I'd said.

25
00:01:57,120 --> 00:02:02,440
I said that regular orbital cycles cause a small change in insulation, and this starts

26
00:02:02,440 --> 00:02:07,400
a process called positive feedback, causing strong warming or cooling.

27
00:02:07,400 --> 00:02:12,880
That again is not my theory, it's the conclusion of scientific research that I've cited.

28
00:02:12,880 --> 00:02:17,640
I'm happy with that being characterised as a tiny nudge, as long as it's understood

29
00:02:17,640 --> 00:02:21,300
that the tiny nudge is a change in insulation.

30
00:02:21,300 --> 00:02:25,760
But I never said that a tiny nudge stops this process.

31
00:02:25,760 --> 00:02:30,940
As I explained, warming or cooling is stopped because feedback is less than one, so positive

32
00:02:30,940 --> 00:02:36,540
feedback gets weaker and weaker, until finally the amount of energy leaving the Earth equals

33
00:02:36,540 --> 00:02:38,920
the amount coming in.

34
00:02:38,920 --> 00:02:42,920
But then he says you start getting feedbacks caused by carbon dioxide and methane being

35
00:02:42,920 --> 00:02:44,260
released from the ground.

36
00:02:44,260 --> 00:02:45,260
Yes.

37
00:02:45,260 --> 00:02:47,340
Yes, I did actually say that.

38
00:02:47,380 --> 00:02:51,820
I think that's the only quote Tony's got right in his entire rebuttal.

39
00:02:51,820 --> 00:02:56,620
The reason I said that is because that's the conclusion of scientific research, and

40
00:02:56,620 --> 00:03:00,060
of course I backed it up by citing scientific studies.

41
00:03:00,060 --> 00:03:05,020
And this starts accelerating it faster and faster until it comes, as he described it,

42
00:03:05,020 --> 00:03:06,140
crashing into the ground.

43
00:03:06,140 --> 00:03:11,300
But of course I never said that any of these glacial cycles come crashing into the ground.

44
00:03:11,300 --> 00:03:13,340
How's that even possible?

45
00:03:13,340 --> 00:03:16,860
He seems to be mixing up two completely different things.

46
00:03:16,900 --> 00:03:22,420
I used this very simple illustration in one of my videos to explain the principle of positive

47
00:03:22,420 --> 00:03:26,720
feedback, using the example of a balance with a rolling weight.

48
00:03:26,720 --> 00:03:30,840
In this example, positive feedback brings the plank crashing to the ground, because

49
00:03:30,840 --> 00:03:33,520
the feedback is greater than one.

50
00:03:33,520 --> 00:03:39,060
In other words, even after the initial forcing stops, the tilting continues and accelerates.

51
00:03:39,060 --> 00:03:43,440
In the example of feedback in glacial cycles, I explained that once the initial forcing

52
00:03:43,440 --> 00:03:48,760
stops, positive feedback doesn't get faster and faster and lead to runaway warming, because

53
00:03:48,760 --> 00:03:51,200
feedback is less than one.

54
00:03:51,200 --> 00:03:55,780
I can list the differences very clearly in this graphic, so hopefully they won't get

55
00:03:55,780 --> 00:03:59,880
mixed up again in Tony's next rebuttal.

56
00:03:59,880 --> 00:04:02,920
But he never explains what crashing into the ground means.

57
00:04:02,920 --> 00:04:09,360
OK, well, crashing to the ground means that the plank of wood crashes into the ground.

58
00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:14,840
Crashing into the ground implies that a very strong force stopped a runaway feedback effect.

59
00:04:14,840 --> 00:04:16,780
It was stopped by the ground.

60
00:04:16,780 --> 00:04:20,360
He wants you to believe that a tiny nudge from orbital cycles starts and stopsâ€¦

61
00:04:20,360 --> 00:04:25,080
Hang on, now Tony's talking about orbital cycles, so let's switch to that subject

62
00:04:25,080 --> 00:04:26,920
and start that again.

63
00:04:26,920 --> 00:04:32,360
He wants you to believe that a tiny nudge from orbital cycles starts and stops ice ages.

64
00:04:32,360 --> 00:04:37,360
Just to repeat, a tiny nudge from orbital cycles doesn't stop ice ages.

65
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:40,200
I never said a tiny nudge stops ice ages.

66
00:04:40,200 --> 00:04:44,640
I don't want anyone to believe a tiny nudge stops ice ages.

67
00:04:44,640 --> 00:04:48,520
But he also wants you to believe that there's some very strong and completely undefined

68
00:04:48,520 --> 00:04:51,980
force which stops this runaway feedback effect.

69
00:04:51,980 --> 00:04:57,000
Just to repeat, the Earth did not experience runaway feedback during glacial cycles, because

70
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:59,120
feedback is less than one.

71
00:04:59,120 --> 00:05:04,680
Therefore a strong and undefined force does not stop this non-existent runaway feedback.

72
00:05:04,680 --> 00:05:09,320
I never said a strong force stops this non-existent runaway feedback.

73
00:05:09,320 --> 00:05:15,120
And I don't want people to believe a strong force stops this non-existent runaway feedback.

74
00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:20,440
None of this nonsense about forces stopping runaway feedback and nudges stopping ice ages

75
00:05:20,440 --> 00:05:24,480
is anywhere in the scientific literature or in my videos.

76
00:05:24,480 --> 00:05:30,240
I'm obviously going to have to explain this again, but this time I'll write it down.

77
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:36,680
Firstly, changes in orbital cycles cause changes in insulation, increasing warming in a crucial

78
00:05:36,680 --> 00:05:39,980
part of the Earth.

79
00:05:39,980 --> 00:05:44,880
This triggers feedbacks that amplify the warming.

80
00:05:44,880 --> 00:05:49,320
Because the Earth's climate feedback is less than one, the feedback effect gets less and

81
00:05:49,320 --> 00:05:51,000
less over time.

82
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:54,680
Think of an echo that bounces around a canyon.

83
00:05:54,680 --> 00:05:59,060
The increase in the Earth's temperature therefore continues at a smaller and smaller rate until

84
00:05:59,060 --> 00:06:04,580
the amount of energy leaving the Earth equals the amount coming in.

85
00:06:04,580 --> 00:06:10,540
The Earth then stabilises at this new higher temperature, called the equilibrium temperature.

86
00:06:10,540 --> 00:06:13,980
It's now in an interglacial.

87
00:06:13,980 --> 00:06:19,580
It remains in the interglacial state for thousands of years until orbital cycles change insulation

88
00:06:19,580 --> 00:06:25,220
in the opposite direction, cooling the Earth, amplified by positive feedback, and the Earth

89
00:06:25,220 --> 00:06:28,140
enters another glacial period.

90
00:06:28,140 --> 00:06:40,220
And once the teeter totter is completely whacked out and crashed into the ground like this,

91
00:06:40,220 --> 00:06:41,980
how did it get back in balance?

92
00:06:41,980 --> 00:06:44,300
He didn't make any attempt to explain that.

93
00:06:44,300 --> 00:06:49,420
Sorry, in that case I'll explain how a teeter totter defies the law of gravity, picks itself

94
00:06:49,420 --> 00:06:52,440
up off the ground, and gets back into balance.

95
00:06:52,440 --> 00:06:55,980
The answer is on the screen.

96
00:06:55,980 --> 00:06:58,460
So here's my experiment I want him to try.

97
00:06:58,460 --> 00:07:03,140
He should put a 300 pound guy on one side with a teeter totter, get it in balance, then

98
00:07:03,140 --> 00:07:07,580
give him a little nudge, and as the teeter totter accelerates faster and faster towards

99
00:07:07,580 --> 00:07:11,760
the ground, he should stick his little pinky finger between the end of the teeter totter

100
00:07:11,760 --> 00:07:16,260
on the ground and give it a tiny little nudge up to stop the motion downward.

101
00:07:16,260 --> 00:07:18,640
Then he can report back to us about how that worked out.

102
00:07:18,640 --> 00:07:20,820
The answer is that your hand would get crushed.

103
00:07:20,820 --> 00:07:25,960
I'm not sure what the point is, except don't put your hand under a teeter totter if a fact

104
00:07:25,960 --> 00:07:27,760
guy sits on it.

105
00:07:27,760 --> 00:07:32,440
His argument is totally ambiguous gibberish and completely scientifically insupportable.

106
00:07:32,440 --> 00:07:37,440
Great, then we have a very clear difference of fact, which is what makes the perfect science

107
00:07:37,440 --> 00:07:38,440
debate.

108
00:07:38,440 --> 00:07:43,760
I say that my explanation of what causes glaciations and the figures I gave for methane are an

109
00:07:43,760 --> 00:07:45,920
accurate reporting of the science.

110
00:07:45,920 --> 00:07:47,540
You say they aren't.

111
00:07:47,540 --> 00:07:50,360
So all we have to do is check the science journals.

112
00:07:50,360 --> 00:07:55,720
Since I've been willing to answer all your questions, let's nail you down on my questions.

113
00:07:55,720 --> 00:08:00,200
Do you now understand the difference between a teeter totter and a glacial cycle?

114
00:08:00,200 --> 00:08:05,200
If you disagree with any of them, please say which ones you disagree with and why.

115
00:08:05,200 --> 00:08:10,240
I've explained during this debate how the Earth's climate feedback systems diminish

116
00:08:10,240 --> 00:08:16,260
once the initial forcing stops until outgoing radiation matches incoming radiation and the

117
00:08:16,260 --> 00:08:19,880
Earth stabilises at a new equilibrium temperature.

118
00:08:19,880 --> 00:08:25,160
This is what the science says, so have I misrepresented the science, and if so, how?

119
00:08:26,200 --> 00:08:30,320
Do you disagree with the figures I gave for the half-life of methane, methane's global

120
00:08:30,320 --> 00:08:36,580
warming potential and the changes in atmospheric methane concentration over the last 40 years?

121
00:08:36,580 --> 00:08:41,520
If so, please give what you think are the correct figures and cite your sources, just

122
00:08:41,520 --> 00:08:43,240
as I've done.

123
00:08:43,240 --> 00:08:47,220
If it's time consuming for you to make videos and you just prefer to talk into a camera

124
00:08:47,220 --> 00:08:51,880
and give your information and your sources verbally, that's fine.

125
00:08:51,880 --> 00:08:55,800
If you say you'd rather give your presentation live, that's fine too.

126
00:08:55,800 --> 00:08:57,320
Please do it live.

127
00:08:57,320 --> 00:09:01,060
Let everyone know what time you're going to give your rebuttal and everyone can watch

128
00:09:01,060 --> 00:09:02,760
it live.

129
00:09:02,760 --> 00:09:06,880
But I'm still going to fact-check your claims however you present them, because there's

130
00:09:06,880 --> 00:09:10,260
no escaping fact-checking in a science debate.

131
00:09:10,260 --> 00:09:12,640
As we've seen, you make mistakes.

132
00:09:12,640 --> 00:09:16,840
I'm happy to put this down to a faulty memory or a misreading of the scientific studies

133
00:09:16,840 --> 00:09:21,700
you sometimes cite, which are the kind of errors we all make, but that's why I fact-check

134
00:09:21,700 --> 00:09:25,580
all your claims and I expect you to fact-check mine.

135
00:09:25,580 --> 00:09:27,820
See if you can find something I've got wrong.

136
00:09:27,820 --> 00:09:32,560
We're not here just to shout at each other, talk past each other, throw insults and make

137
00:09:32,560 --> 00:09:35,400
things up as we go along.

138
00:09:35,400 --> 00:09:40,120
Science debates aren't about declaring yourself the winner, as you put it in yet another made-up

139
00:09:40,120 --> 00:09:41,120
quote Tony.

140
00:09:41,120 --> 00:09:45,540
It's about establishing who's got his facts right and who's wrong.

141
00:09:45,540 --> 00:09:48,480
Getting to the truth makes both of us winners.

142
00:09:48,480 --> 00:09:53,480
And presenting evidence to support an assertion or disprove someone's spurious claim isn't

143
00:09:53,480 --> 00:09:58,020
digging in heels, it's how we separate fact from fiction.

144
00:09:58,020 --> 00:10:02,160
Of course you can make your next rebuttal another round of personal insults if you really

145
00:10:02,160 --> 00:10:07,360
want to, but I think most people would like to see a debate where we bring facts and figures

146
00:10:07,360 --> 00:10:12,760
to the table, compare them, cite our sources and fact-check to get to the bottom of who's

147
00:10:12,760 --> 00:10:14,400
right and who's wrong.

148
00:10:14,400 --> 00:10:15,520
Don't you agree?
