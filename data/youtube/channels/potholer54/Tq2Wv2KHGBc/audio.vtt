00:00.000 --> 00:05.160
A few months ago I started having a video debate with a guy named Potholler, who had

00:05.160 --> 00:08.440
made some utterly ludicrous assertions in his videos.

00:08.440 --> 00:12.960
Well one thing's true, we were having a great debate, and I'm very happy to link

00:12.960 --> 00:17.920
the debate in the video description so you can judge for yourselves. Tony opened the

00:17.920 --> 00:23.880
debate by making these claims, which I listed in my opening response. And then I provided

00:23.880 --> 00:29.240
clear evidence that disproved each and every one, either by checking Tony's sources and

00:29.240 --> 00:34.720
how he misread them, or showing things that he claimed didn't exist, or challenging

00:34.720 --> 00:40.080
his misquotes by asking for video clips that he couldn't provide, or contradicting his

00:40.080 --> 00:46.200
claims with actual facts and figures, which is how science debates are supposed to work.

00:46.200 --> 00:50.280
After only three rounds of this, Tony refused to continue.

00:50.280 --> 00:55.440
So I'm delighted to see that eight months on he's finally rejoined the debate, a week

00:55.440 --> 00:59.920
before I was due to fly home in fact, so he's just in time.

00:59.920 --> 01:04.200
I got back a couple of days ago, so I can now post my response.

01:04.200 --> 01:09.800
So let's take a look at his latest rebuttal.

01:09.800 --> 01:14.120
Hold on, as I've said before, personal insults aren't helpful, and they don't shed any

01:14.120 --> 01:19.300
light on who's correctly reporting the facts. I'm going to maintain this debate as a debate

01:19.300 --> 01:24.200
about science, not who can produce the most offensive personal insult.

01:24.200 --> 01:29.320
But before we go on to what I actually said, let's start with what Tony claims I said

01:29.320 --> 01:33.760
using illustrations from my video that address the point he's making.

01:33.760 --> 01:38.840
So potholars arguing boils down to the idea that a little tiny nudge caused by changes

01:38.840 --> 01:42.480
in orbital cycles starts and ends ice ages.

01:42.480 --> 01:47.520
Tony's misquote is what's known as a straw man, invent something completely ridiculous,

01:47.520 --> 01:51.880
claim the other person said it, and then masterfully demolish it.

01:51.880 --> 01:57.120
So let's go with what I actually said, rather than what Tony wishes I'd said.

01:57.120 --> 02:02.440
I said that regular orbital cycles cause a small change in insulation, and this starts

02:02.440 --> 02:07.400
a process called positive feedback, causing strong warming or cooling.

02:07.400 --> 02:12.880
That again is not my theory, it's the conclusion of scientific research that I've cited.

02:12.880 --> 02:17.640
I'm happy with that being characterised as a tiny nudge, as long as it's understood

02:17.640 --> 02:21.300
that the tiny nudge is a change in insulation.

02:21.300 --> 02:25.760
But I never said that a tiny nudge stops this process.

02:25.760 --> 02:30.940
As I explained, warming or cooling is stopped because feedback is less than one, so positive

02:30.940 --> 02:36.540
feedback gets weaker and weaker, until finally the amount of energy leaving the Earth equals

02:36.540 --> 02:38.920
the amount coming in.

02:38.920 --> 02:42.920
But then he says you start getting feedbacks caused by carbon dioxide and methane being

02:42.920 --> 02:44.260
released from the ground.

02:44.260 --> 02:45.260
Yes.

02:45.260 --> 02:47.340
Yes, I did actually say that.

02:47.380 --> 02:51.820
I think that's the only quote Tony's got right in his entire rebuttal.

02:51.820 --> 02:56.620
The reason I said that is because that's the conclusion of scientific research, and

02:56.620 --> 03:00.060
of course I backed it up by citing scientific studies.

03:00.060 --> 03:05.020
And this starts accelerating it faster and faster until it comes, as he described it,

03:05.020 --> 03:06.140
crashing into the ground.

03:06.140 --> 03:11.300
But of course I never said that any of these glacial cycles come crashing into the ground.

03:11.300 --> 03:13.340
How's that even possible?

03:13.340 --> 03:16.860
He seems to be mixing up two completely different things.

03:16.900 --> 03:22.420
I used this very simple illustration in one of my videos to explain the principle of positive

03:22.420 --> 03:26.720
feedback, using the example of a balance with a rolling weight.

03:26.720 --> 03:30.840
In this example, positive feedback brings the plank crashing to the ground, because

03:30.840 --> 03:33.520
the feedback is greater than one.

03:33.520 --> 03:39.060
In other words, even after the initial forcing stops, the tilting continues and accelerates.

03:39.060 --> 03:43.440
In the example of feedback in glacial cycles, I explained that once the initial forcing

03:43.440 --> 03:48.760
stops, positive feedback doesn't get faster and faster and lead to runaway warming, because

03:48.760 --> 03:51.200
feedback is less than one.

03:51.200 --> 03:55.780
I can list the differences very clearly in this graphic, so hopefully they won't get

03:55.780 --> 03:59.880
mixed up again in Tony's next rebuttal.

03:59.880 --> 04:02.920
But he never explains what crashing into the ground means.

04:02.920 --> 04:09.360
OK, well, crashing to the ground means that the plank of wood crashes into the ground.

04:09.360 --> 04:14.840
Crashing into the ground implies that a very strong force stopped a runaway feedback effect.

04:14.840 --> 04:16.780
It was stopped by the ground.

04:16.780 --> 04:20.360
He wants you to believe that a tiny nudge from orbital cycles starts and stopsâ€¦

04:20.360 --> 04:25.080
Hang on, now Tony's talking about orbital cycles, so let's switch to that subject

04:25.080 --> 04:26.920
and start that again.

04:26.920 --> 04:32.360
He wants you to believe that a tiny nudge from orbital cycles starts and stops ice ages.

04:32.360 --> 04:37.360
Just to repeat, a tiny nudge from orbital cycles doesn't stop ice ages.

04:37.360 --> 04:40.200
I never said a tiny nudge stops ice ages.

04:40.200 --> 04:44.640
I don't want anyone to believe a tiny nudge stops ice ages.

04:44.640 --> 04:48.520
But he also wants you to believe that there's some very strong and completely undefined

04:48.520 --> 04:51.980
force which stops this runaway feedback effect.

04:51.980 --> 04:57.000
Just to repeat, the Earth did not experience runaway feedback during glacial cycles, because

04:57.000 --> 04:59.120
feedback is less than one.

04:59.120 --> 05:04.680
Therefore a strong and undefined force does not stop this non-existent runaway feedback.

05:04.680 --> 05:09.320
I never said a strong force stops this non-existent runaway feedback.

05:09.320 --> 05:15.120
And I don't want people to believe a strong force stops this non-existent runaway feedback.

05:15.120 --> 05:20.440
None of this nonsense about forces stopping runaway feedback and nudges stopping ice ages

05:20.440 --> 05:24.480
is anywhere in the scientific literature or in my videos.

05:24.480 --> 05:30.240
I'm obviously going to have to explain this again, but this time I'll write it down.

05:30.800 --> 05:36.680
Firstly, changes in orbital cycles cause changes in insulation, increasing warming in a crucial

05:36.680 --> 05:39.980
part of the Earth.

05:39.980 --> 05:44.880
This triggers feedbacks that amplify the warming.

05:44.880 --> 05:49.320
Because the Earth's climate feedback is less than one, the feedback effect gets less and

05:49.320 --> 05:51.000
less over time.

05:51.000 --> 05:54.680
Think of an echo that bounces around a canyon.

05:54.680 --> 05:59.060
The increase in the Earth's temperature therefore continues at a smaller and smaller rate until

05:59.060 --> 06:04.580
the amount of energy leaving the Earth equals the amount coming in.

06:04.580 --> 06:10.540
The Earth then stabilises at this new higher temperature, called the equilibrium temperature.

06:10.540 --> 06:13.980
It's now in an interglacial.

06:13.980 --> 06:19.580
It remains in the interglacial state for thousands of years until orbital cycles change insulation

06:19.580 --> 06:25.220
in the opposite direction, cooling the Earth, amplified by positive feedback, and the Earth

06:25.220 --> 06:28.140
enters another glacial period.

06:28.140 --> 06:40.220
And once the teeter totter is completely whacked out and crashed into the ground like this,

06:40.220 --> 06:41.980
how did it get back in balance?

06:41.980 --> 06:44.300
He didn't make any attempt to explain that.

06:44.300 --> 06:49.420
Sorry, in that case I'll explain how a teeter totter defies the law of gravity, picks itself

06:49.420 --> 06:52.440
up off the ground, and gets back into balance.

06:52.440 --> 06:55.980
The answer is on the screen.

06:55.980 --> 06:58.460
So here's my experiment I want him to try.

06:58.460 --> 07:03.140
He should put a 300 pound guy on one side with a teeter totter, get it in balance, then

07:03.140 --> 07:07.580
give him a little nudge, and as the teeter totter accelerates faster and faster towards

07:07.580 --> 07:11.760
the ground, he should stick his little pinky finger between the end of the teeter totter

07:11.760 --> 07:16.260
on the ground and give it a tiny little nudge up to stop the motion downward.

07:16.260 --> 07:18.640
Then he can report back to us about how that worked out.

07:18.640 --> 07:20.820
The answer is that your hand would get crushed.

07:20.820 --> 07:25.960
I'm not sure what the point is, except don't put your hand under a teeter totter if a fact

07:25.960 --> 07:27.760
guy sits on it.

07:27.760 --> 07:32.440
His argument is totally ambiguous gibberish and completely scientifically insupportable.

07:32.440 --> 07:37.440
Great, then we have a very clear difference of fact, which is what makes the perfect science

07:37.440 --> 07:38.440
debate.

07:38.440 --> 07:43.760
I say that my explanation of what causes glaciations and the figures I gave for methane are an

07:43.760 --> 07:45.920
accurate reporting of the science.

07:45.920 --> 07:47.540
You say they aren't.

07:47.540 --> 07:50.360
So all we have to do is check the science journals.

07:50.360 --> 07:55.720
Since I've been willing to answer all your questions, let's nail you down on my questions.

07:55.720 --> 08:00.200
Do you now understand the difference between a teeter totter and a glacial cycle?

08:00.200 --> 08:05.200
If you disagree with any of them, please say which ones you disagree with and why.

08:05.200 --> 08:10.240
I've explained during this debate how the Earth's climate feedback systems diminish

08:10.240 --> 08:16.260
once the initial forcing stops until outgoing radiation matches incoming radiation and the

08:16.260 --> 08:19.880
Earth stabilises at a new equilibrium temperature.

08:19.880 --> 08:25.160
This is what the science says, so have I misrepresented the science, and if so, how?

08:26.200 --> 08:30.320
Do you disagree with the figures I gave for the half-life of methane, methane's global

08:30.320 --> 08:36.580
warming potential and the changes in atmospheric methane concentration over the last 40 years?

08:36.580 --> 08:41.520
If so, please give what you think are the correct figures and cite your sources, just

08:41.520 --> 08:43.240
as I've done.

08:43.240 --> 08:47.220
If it's time consuming for you to make videos and you just prefer to talk into a camera

08:47.220 --> 08:51.880
and give your information and your sources verbally, that's fine.

08:51.880 --> 08:55.800
If you say you'd rather give your presentation live, that's fine too.

08:55.800 --> 08:57.320
Please do it live.

08:57.320 --> 09:01.060
Let everyone know what time you're going to give your rebuttal and everyone can watch

09:01.060 --> 09:02.760
it live.

09:02.760 --> 09:06.880
But I'm still going to fact-check your claims however you present them, because there's

09:06.880 --> 09:10.260
no escaping fact-checking in a science debate.

09:10.260 --> 09:12.640
As we've seen, you make mistakes.

09:12.640 --> 09:16.840
I'm happy to put this down to a faulty memory or a misreading of the scientific studies

09:16.840 --> 09:21.700
you sometimes cite, which are the kind of errors we all make, but that's why I fact-check

09:21.700 --> 09:25.580
all your claims and I expect you to fact-check mine.

09:25.580 --> 09:27.820
See if you can find something I've got wrong.

09:27.820 --> 09:32.560
We're not here just to shout at each other, talk past each other, throw insults and make

09:32.560 --> 09:35.400
things up as we go along.

09:35.400 --> 09:40.120
Science debates aren't about declaring yourself the winner, as you put it in yet another made-up

09:40.120 --> 09:41.120
quote Tony.

09:41.120 --> 09:45.540
It's about establishing who's got his facts right and who's wrong.

09:45.540 --> 09:48.480
Getting to the truth makes both of us winners.

09:48.480 --> 09:53.480
And presenting evidence to support an assertion or disprove someone's spurious claim isn't

09:53.480 --> 09:58.020
digging in heels, it's how we separate fact from fiction.

09:58.020 --> 10:02.160
Of course you can make your next rebuttal another round of personal insults if you really

10:02.160 --> 10:07.360
want to, but I think most people would like to see a debate where we bring facts and figures

10:07.360 --> 10:12.760
to the table, compare them, cite our sources and fact-check to get to the bottom of who's

10:12.760 --> 10:14.400
right and who's wrong.

10:14.400 --> 10:15.520
Don't you agree?
