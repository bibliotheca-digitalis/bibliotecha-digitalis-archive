0	5160	A few months ago I started having a video debate with a guy named Potholler, who had
5160	8440	made some utterly ludicrous assertions in his videos.
8440	12960	Well one thing's true, we were having a great debate, and I'm very happy to link
12960	17920	the debate in the video description so you can judge for yourselves. Tony opened the
17920	23880	debate by making these claims, which I listed in my opening response. And then I provided
23880	29240	clear evidence that disproved each and every one, either by checking Tony's sources and
29240	34720	how he misread them, or showing things that he claimed didn't exist, or challenging
34720	40080	his misquotes by asking for video clips that he couldn't provide, or contradicting his
40080	46200	claims with actual facts and figures, which is how science debates are supposed to work.
46200	50280	After only three rounds of this, Tony refused to continue.
50280	55440	So I'm delighted to see that eight months on he's finally rejoined the debate, a week
55440	59920	before I was due to fly home in fact, so he's just in time.
59920	64200	I got back a couple of days ago, so I can now post my response.
64200	69800	So let's take a look at his latest rebuttal.
69800	74120	Hold on, as I've said before, personal insults aren't helpful, and they don't shed any
74120	79300	light on who's correctly reporting the facts. I'm going to maintain this debate as a debate
79300	84200	about science, not who can produce the most offensive personal insult.
84200	89320	But before we go on to what I actually said, let's start with what Tony claims I said
89320	93760	using illustrations from my video that address the point he's making.
93760	98840	So potholars arguing boils down to the idea that a little tiny nudge caused by changes
98840	102480	in orbital cycles starts and ends ice ages.
102480	107520	Tony's misquote is what's known as a straw man, invent something completely ridiculous,
107520	111880	claim the other person said it, and then masterfully demolish it.
111880	117120	So let's go with what I actually said, rather than what Tony wishes I'd said.
117120	122440	I said that regular orbital cycles cause a small change in insulation, and this starts
122440	127400	a process called positive feedback, causing strong warming or cooling.
127400	132880	That again is not my theory, it's the conclusion of scientific research that I've cited.
132880	137640	I'm happy with that being characterised as a tiny nudge, as long as it's understood
137640	141300	that the tiny nudge is a change in insulation.
141300	145760	But I never said that a tiny nudge stops this process.
145760	150940	As I explained, warming or cooling is stopped because feedback is less than one, so positive
150940	156540	feedback gets weaker and weaker, until finally the amount of energy leaving the Earth equals
156540	158920	the amount coming in.
158920	162920	But then he says you start getting feedbacks caused by carbon dioxide and methane being
162920	164260	released from the ground.
164260	165260	Yes.
165260	167340	Yes, I did actually say that.
167380	171820	I think that's the only quote Tony's got right in his entire rebuttal.
171820	176620	The reason I said that is because that's the conclusion of scientific research, and
176620	180060	of course I backed it up by citing scientific studies.
180060	185020	And this starts accelerating it faster and faster until it comes, as he described it,
185020	186140	crashing into the ground.
186140	191300	But of course I never said that any of these glacial cycles come crashing into the ground.
191300	193340	How's that even possible?
193340	196860	He seems to be mixing up two completely different things.
196900	202420	I used this very simple illustration in one of my videos to explain the principle of positive
202420	206720	feedback, using the example of a balance with a rolling weight.
206720	210840	In this example, positive feedback brings the plank crashing to the ground, because
210840	213520	the feedback is greater than one.
213520	219060	In other words, even after the initial forcing stops, the tilting continues and accelerates.
219060	223440	In the example of feedback in glacial cycles, I explained that once the initial forcing
223440	228760	stops, positive feedback doesn't get faster and faster and lead to runaway warming, because
228760	231200	feedback is less than one.
231200	235780	I can list the differences very clearly in this graphic, so hopefully they won't get
235780	239880	mixed up again in Tony's next rebuttal.
239880	242920	But he never explains what crashing into the ground means.
242920	249360	OK, well, crashing to the ground means that the plank of wood crashes into the ground.
249360	254840	Crashing into the ground implies that a very strong force stopped a runaway feedback effect.
254840	256780	It was stopped by the ground.
256780	260360	He wants you to believe that a tiny nudge from orbital cycles starts and stopsâ€¦
260360	265080	Hang on, now Tony's talking about orbital cycles, so let's switch to that subject
265080	266920	and start that again.
266920	272360	He wants you to believe that a tiny nudge from orbital cycles starts and stops ice ages.
272360	277360	Just to repeat, a tiny nudge from orbital cycles doesn't stop ice ages.
277360	280200	I never said a tiny nudge stops ice ages.
280200	284640	I don't want anyone to believe a tiny nudge stops ice ages.
284640	288520	But he also wants you to believe that there's some very strong and completely undefined
288520	291980	force which stops this runaway feedback effect.
291980	297000	Just to repeat, the Earth did not experience runaway feedback during glacial cycles, because
297000	299120	feedback is less than one.
299120	304680	Therefore a strong and undefined force does not stop this non-existent runaway feedback.
304680	309320	I never said a strong force stops this non-existent runaway feedback.
309320	315120	And I don't want people to believe a strong force stops this non-existent runaway feedback.
315120	320440	None of this nonsense about forces stopping runaway feedback and nudges stopping ice ages
320440	324480	is anywhere in the scientific literature or in my videos.
324480	330240	I'm obviously going to have to explain this again, but this time I'll write it down.
330800	336680	Firstly, changes in orbital cycles cause changes in insulation, increasing warming in a crucial
336680	339980	part of the Earth.
339980	344880	This triggers feedbacks that amplify the warming.
344880	349320	Because the Earth's climate feedback is less than one, the feedback effect gets less and
349320	351000	less over time.
351000	354680	Think of an echo that bounces around a canyon.
354680	359060	The increase in the Earth's temperature therefore continues at a smaller and smaller rate until
359060	364580	the amount of energy leaving the Earth equals the amount coming in.
364580	370540	The Earth then stabilises at this new higher temperature, called the equilibrium temperature.
370540	373980	It's now in an interglacial.
373980	379580	It remains in the interglacial state for thousands of years until orbital cycles change insulation
379580	385220	in the opposite direction, cooling the Earth, amplified by positive feedback, and the Earth
385220	388140	enters another glacial period.
388140	400220	And once the teeter totter is completely whacked out and crashed into the ground like this,
400220	401980	how did it get back in balance?
401980	404300	He didn't make any attempt to explain that.
404300	409420	Sorry, in that case I'll explain how a teeter totter defies the law of gravity, picks itself
409420	412440	up off the ground, and gets back into balance.
412440	415980	The answer is on the screen.
415980	418460	So here's my experiment I want him to try.
418460	423140	He should put a 300 pound guy on one side with a teeter totter, get it in balance, then
423140	427580	give him a little nudge, and as the teeter totter accelerates faster and faster towards
427580	431760	the ground, he should stick his little pinky finger between the end of the teeter totter
431760	436260	on the ground and give it a tiny little nudge up to stop the motion downward.
436260	438640	Then he can report back to us about how that worked out.
438640	440820	The answer is that your hand would get crushed.
440820	445960	I'm not sure what the point is, except don't put your hand under a teeter totter if a fact
445960	447760	guy sits on it.
447760	452440	His argument is totally ambiguous gibberish and completely scientifically insupportable.
452440	457440	Great, then we have a very clear difference of fact, which is what makes the perfect science
457440	458440	debate.
458440	463760	I say that my explanation of what causes glaciations and the figures I gave for methane are an
463760	465920	accurate reporting of the science.
465920	467540	You say they aren't.
467540	470360	So all we have to do is check the science journals.
470360	475720	Since I've been willing to answer all your questions, let's nail you down on my questions.
475720	480200	Do you now understand the difference between a teeter totter and a glacial cycle?
480200	485200	If you disagree with any of them, please say which ones you disagree with and why.
485200	490240	I've explained during this debate how the Earth's climate feedback systems diminish
490240	496260	once the initial forcing stops until outgoing radiation matches incoming radiation and the
496260	499880	Earth stabilises at a new equilibrium temperature.
499880	505160	This is what the science says, so have I misrepresented the science, and if so, how?
506200	510320	Do you disagree with the figures I gave for the half-life of methane, methane's global
510320	516580	warming potential and the changes in atmospheric methane concentration over the last 40 years?
516580	521520	If so, please give what you think are the correct figures and cite your sources, just
521520	523240	as I've done.
523240	527220	If it's time consuming for you to make videos and you just prefer to talk into a camera
527220	531880	and give your information and your sources verbally, that's fine.
531880	535800	If you say you'd rather give your presentation live, that's fine too.
535800	537320	Please do it live.
537320	541060	Let everyone know what time you're going to give your rebuttal and everyone can watch
541060	542760	it live.
542760	546880	But I'm still going to fact-check your claims however you present them, because there's
546880	550260	no escaping fact-checking in a science debate.
550260	552640	As we've seen, you make mistakes.
552640	556840	I'm happy to put this down to a faulty memory or a misreading of the scientific studies
556840	561700	you sometimes cite, which are the kind of errors we all make, but that's why I fact-check
561700	565580	all your claims and I expect you to fact-check mine.
565580	567820	See if you can find something I've got wrong.
567820	572560	We're not here just to shout at each other, talk past each other, throw insults and make
572560	575400	things up as we go along.
575400	580120	Science debates aren't about declaring yourself the winner, as you put it in yet another made-up
580120	581120	quote Tony.
581120	585540	It's about establishing who's got his facts right and who's wrong.
585540	588480	Getting to the truth makes both of us winners.
588480	593480	And presenting evidence to support an assertion or disprove someone's spurious claim isn't
593480	598020	digging in heels, it's how we separate fact from fiction.
598020	602160	Of course you can make your next rebuttal another round of personal insults if you really
602160	607360	want to, but I think most people would like to see a debate where we bring facts and figures
607360	612760	to the table, compare them, cite our sources and fact-check to get to the bottom of who's
612760	614400	right and who's wrong.
614400	615520	Don't you agree?
