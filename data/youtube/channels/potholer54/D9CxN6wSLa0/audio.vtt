00:00.000 --> 00:04.400
First thing in the morning here in Australia, I always tune in to overnight news from the

00:04.400 --> 00:08.660
United States to find out, oh what now.

00:08.660 --> 00:13.200
But this morning an item came up that really made me bury my head in my hands.

00:13.200 --> 00:16.440
A potentially cancer-causing chemical could be in your cup.

00:16.440 --> 00:20.760
A judge in Los Angeles has ruled that coffee shops like Starbucks have to warn you that

00:20.760 --> 00:24.800
roasting coffee beans produces the chemical acrylamide.

00:24.800 --> 00:30.580
Acrylamide forms when amino acids and sugars react together at temperatures over 120Â°C.

00:30.580 --> 00:35.480
It's known as the Maillard reaction, and it's common in starchy processed foods like french

00:35.480 --> 00:40.120
fries and bread, but it also occurs in roasted coffee beans.

00:40.120 --> 00:45.980
So far epidemiological studies have found no link between coffee and cancer in humans.

00:45.980 --> 00:50.240
That doesn't mean there isn't one, it just means no link has been found.

00:50.240 --> 00:55.840
Most health organisations say acrylamide is probably or reasonably anticipated or likely

00:55.840 --> 01:00.880
to be a carcinogen in humans, but they don't see just coffee as the culprit.

01:00.880 --> 01:04.240
It's the ubiquity of acrylamide in processed foods.

01:04.240 --> 01:07.880
But in high doses acrylamide has been found to cause cancer in mice.

01:07.880 --> 01:13.040
Yes indeed, but the doses given in these studies were a thousand to ten thousand times higher

01:13.040 --> 01:16.560
than humans would consume in the same time period.

01:16.560 --> 01:20.360
And even higher if you just take coffee on its own.

01:20.360 --> 01:25.000
So if you're worried about acrylamide, and maybe you should be, then coffee is the least

01:25.000 --> 01:26.200
of your worries.

01:26.200 --> 01:30.600
Stop eating bread, cookies, potato chips, breakfast cereals and french fries.

01:30.600 --> 01:35.560
Or just eat them in moderation, because even taken collectively you'd have to have a pretty

01:35.560 --> 01:41.320
unhealthy diet to even begin to approach the kinds of doses of acrylamide that laboratory

01:41.320 --> 01:44.000
rats and mice were fed.

01:44.000 --> 01:47.760
I looked at a number of different studies that quantify the amounts of acrylamide in

01:47.760 --> 01:53.280
various foods, and coffee is much lower than a lot of everyday foods the average person

01:53.280 --> 01:54.560
consumes.

01:54.560 --> 02:00.960
Unfortunately, the law doesn't necessarily conform to scientific norms or common sense.

02:00.960 --> 02:05.440
The law requires that Starbucks, the lead defendant in the suit, had to show that coffee

02:05.440 --> 02:11.920
posed no risk and wouldn't cause one or more cases of cancer for every 100,000 people.

02:11.920 --> 02:16.560
So although there's no evidence that coffee is harmful, that's not enough for the courts.

02:16.560 --> 02:20.280
The coffee companies have to show that it's not harmful.

02:20.280 --> 02:24.680
Some have accused lawyers of taking advantage of the state regulation, which includes exemptions

02:24.680 --> 02:29.320
for some chemicals that occur naturally in uncooked food, for settlement money.

02:29.320 --> 02:31.720
Oh gee, do you think?

02:31.720 --> 02:37.000
Just to declare my non-interest, I don't own shares in Starbucks or any coffee companies,

02:37.000 --> 02:41.200
and to redress the balance and eliminate any perception of bias, I'd just like to add

02:41.200 --> 02:43.600
that Starbucks coffee tastes like shit.

02:43.600 --> 02:48.760
I asked a friend of mine living in the US why Americans are so enamoured with Starbucks,

02:48.760 --> 02:54.240
and he said they'd spent so many decades drinking stewed day-old coffee out of brewing pots

02:54.240 --> 02:57.920
that when crap coffee came along, they thought it was drinkable.

02:57.920 --> 03:00.280
But anyway, back to the science.

03:00.280 --> 03:04.800
It may not be the judge's fault, after all he has to follow the letter of the law, and

03:04.800 --> 03:09.720
the letter of the law was not the result of well-thought-out science-based legislation,

03:09.720 --> 03:15.400
it was the result of Proposition 65, proposed by people with a bad idea and voted for by

03:15.400 --> 03:17.080
people with no idea.

03:17.080 --> 03:21.800
Well, you don't want food legislation to be drafted by elitists who pass their chemistry

03:21.800 --> 03:23.960
and medical degrees, do you?

03:23.960 --> 03:26.600
So you get what you wish for.

03:26.600 --> 03:29.100
Labelling known carcinogens is fine.

03:29.100 --> 03:34.280
The problem with this silly law is that it casts its net so wide that known carcinogens

03:34.280 --> 03:39.400
that really are cancerous get buried under the weight of relatively safe foods and drinks,

03:39.400 --> 03:41.560
burdened with similar labels.

03:41.560 --> 03:43.960
How are ordinary consumers supposed to know the difference?

03:43.960 --> 03:46.960
Appreciative of the fact that they let you know, and then you make a decision.

03:46.960 --> 03:48.740
Know what, Erica?

03:48.740 --> 03:52.880
That the law supposes coffee might give you cancer when researchers have found no evidence

03:52.880 --> 03:53.880
of that?

03:53.880 --> 03:58.040
Then I guess Mr Bumble said it best in the Dickens novel Oliver Twist.

03:58.040 --> 04:03.800
If the law supposes that, said Mr Bumble, squeezing his hat emphatically in both hands,

04:03.800 --> 04:06.000
the law is a ass, a idiot.
