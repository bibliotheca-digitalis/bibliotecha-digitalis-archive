00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,400
First thing in the morning here in Australia, I always tune in to overnight news from the

2
00:00:04,400 --> 00:00:08,660
United States to find out, oh what now.

3
00:00:08,660 --> 00:00:13,200
But this morning an item came up that really made me bury my head in my hands.

4
00:00:13,200 --> 00:00:16,440
A potentially cancer-causing chemical could be in your cup.

5
00:00:16,440 --> 00:00:20,760
A judge in Los Angeles has ruled that coffee shops like Starbucks have to warn you that

6
00:00:20,760 --> 00:00:24,800
roasting coffee beans produces the chemical acrylamide.

7
00:00:24,800 --> 00:00:30,580
Acrylamide forms when amino acids and sugars react together at temperatures over 120Â°C.

8
00:00:30,580 --> 00:00:35,480
It's known as the Maillard reaction, and it's common in starchy processed foods like french

9
00:00:35,480 --> 00:00:40,120
fries and bread, but it also occurs in roasted coffee beans.

10
00:00:40,120 --> 00:00:45,980
So far epidemiological studies have found no link between coffee and cancer in humans.

11
00:00:45,980 --> 00:00:50,240
That doesn't mean there isn't one, it just means no link has been found.

12
00:00:50,240 --> 00:00:55,840
Most health organisations say acrylamide is probably or reasonably anticipated or likely

13
00:00:55,840 --> 00:01:00,880
to be a carcinogen in humans, but they don't see just coffee as the culprit.

14
00:01:00,880 --> 00:01:04,240
It's the ubiquity of acrylamide in processed foods.

15
00:01:04,240 --> 00:01:07,880
But in high doses acrylamide has been found to cause cancer in mice.

16
00:01:07,880 --> 00:01:13,040
Yes indeed, but the doses given in these studies were a thousand to ten thousand times higher

17
00:01:13,040 --> 00:01:16,560
than humans would consume in the same time period.

18
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:20,360
And even higher if you just take coffee on its own.

19
00:01:20,360 --> 00:01:25,000
So if you're worried about acrylamide, and maybe you should be, then coffee is the least

20
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:26,200
of your worries.

21
00:01:26,200 --> 00:01:30,600
Stop eating bread, cookies, potato chips, breakfast cereals and french fries.

22
00:01:30,600 --> 00:01:35,560
Or just eat them in moderation, because even taken collectively you'd have to have a pretty

23
00:01:35,560 --> 00:01:41,320
unhealthy diet to even begin to approach the kinds of doses of acrylamide that laboratory

24
00:01:41,320 --> 00:01:44,000
rats and mice were fed.

25
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:47,760
I looked at a number of different studies that quantify the amounts of acrylamide in

26
00:01:47,760 --> 00:01:53,280
various foods, and coffee is much lower than a lot of everyday foods the average person

27
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:54,560
consumes.

28
00:01:54,560 --> 00:02:00,960
Unfortunately, the law doesn't necessarily conform to scientific norms or common sense.

29
00:02:00,960 --> 00:02:05,440
The law requires that Starbucks, the lead defendant in the suit, had to show that coffee

30
00:02:05,440 --> 00:02:11,920
posed no risk and wouldn't cause one or more cases of cancer for every 100,000 people.

31
00:02:11,920 --> 00:02:16,560
So although there's no evidence that coffee is harmful, that's not enough for the courts.

32
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:20,280
The coffee companies have to show that it's not harmful.

33
00:02:20,280 --> 00:02:24,680
Some have accused lawyers of taking advantage of the state regulation, which includes exemptions

34
00:02:24,680 --> 00:02:29,320
for some chemicals that occur naturally in uncooked food, for settlement money.

35
00:02:29,320 --> 00:02:31,720
Oh gee, do you think?

36
00:02:31,720 --> 00:02:37,000
Just to declare my non-interest, I don't own shares in Starbucks or any coffee companies,

37
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:41,200
and to redress the balance and eliminate any perception of bias, I'd just like to add

38
00:02:41,200 --> 00:02:43,600
that Starbucks coffee tastes like shit.

39
00:02:43,600 --> 00:02:48,760
I asked a friend of mine living in the US why Americans are so enamoured with Starbucks,

40
00:02:48,760 --> 00:02:54,240
and he said they'd spent so many decades drinking stewed day-old coffee out of brewing pots

41
00:02:54,240 --> 00:02:57,920
that when crap coffee came along, they thought it was drinkable.

42
00:02:57,920 --> 00:03:00,280
But anyway, back to the science.

43
00:03:00,280 --> 00:03:04,800
It may not be the judge's fault, after all he has to follow the letter of the law, and

44
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:09,720
the letter of the law was not the result of well-thought-out science-based legislation,

45
00:03:09,720 --> 00:03:15,400
it was the result of Proposition 65, proposed by people with a bad idea and voted for by

46
00:03:15,400 --> 00:03:17,080
people with no idea.

47
00:03:17,080 --> 00:03:21,800
Well, you don't want food legislation to be drafted by elitists who pass their chemistry

48
00:03:21,800 --> 00:03:23,960
and medical degrees, do you?

49
00:03:23,960 --> 00:03:26,600
So you get what you wish for.

50
00:03:26,600 --> 00:03:29,100
Labelling known carcinogens is fine.

51
00:03:29,100 --> 00:03:34,280
The problem with this silly law is that it casts its net so wide that known carcinogens

52
00:03:34,280 --> 00:03:39,400
that really are cancerous get buried under the weight of relatively safe foods and drinks,

53
00:03:39,400 --> 00:03:41,560
burdened with similar labels.

54
00:03:41,560 --> 00:03:43,960
How are ordinary consumers supposed to know the difference?

55
00:03:43,960 --> 00:03:46,960
Appreciative of the fact that they let you know, and then you make a decision.

56
00:03:46,960 --> 00:03:48,740
Know what, Erica?

57
00:03:48,740 --> 00:03:52,880
That the law supposes coffee might give you cancer when researchers have found no evidence

58
00:03:52,880 --> 00:03:53,880
of that?

59
00:03:53,880 --> 00:03:58,040
Then I guess Mr Bumble said it best in the Dickens novel Oliver Twist.

60
00:03:58,040 --> 00:04:03,800
If the law supposes that, said Mr Bumble, squeezing his hat emphatically in both hands,

61
00:04:03,800 --> 00:04:06,000
the law is a ass, a idiot.
