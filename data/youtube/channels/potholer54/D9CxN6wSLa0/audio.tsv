0	4400	First thing in the morning here in Australia, I always tune in to overnight news from the
4400	8660	United States to find out, oh what now.
8660	13200	But this morning an item came up that really made me bury my head in my hands.
13200	16440	A potentially cancer-causing chemical could be in your cup.
16440	20760	A judge in Los Angeles has ruled that coffee shops like Starbucks have to warn you that
20760	24800	roasting coffee beans produces the chemical acrylamide.
24800	30580	Acrylamide forms when amino acids and sugars react together at temperatures over 120Â°C.
30580	35480	It's known as the Maillard reaction, and it's common in starchy processed foods like french
35480	40120	fries and bread, but it also occurs in roasted coffee beans.
40120	45980	So far epidemiological studies have found no link between coffee and cancer in humans.
45980	50240	That doesn't mean there isn't one, it just means no link has been found.
50240	55840	Most health organisations say acrylamide is probably or reasonably anticipated or likely
55840	60880	to be a carcinogen in humans, but they don't see just coffee as the culprit.
60880	64240	It's the ubiquity of acrylamide in processed foods.
64240	67880	But in high doses acrylamide has been found to cause cancer in mice.
67880	73040	Yes indeed, but the doses given in these studies were a thousand to ten thousand times higher
73040	76560	than humans would consume in the same time period.
76560	80360	And even higher if you just take coffee on its own.
80360	85000	So if you're worried about acrylamide, and maybe you should be, then coffee is the least
85000	86200	of your worries.
86200	90600	Stop eating bread, cookies, potato chips, breakfast cereals and french fries.
90600	95560	Or just eat them in moderation, because even taken collectively you'd have to have a pretty
95560	101320	unhealthy diet to even begin to approach the kinds of doses of acrylamide that laboratory
101320	104000	rats and mice were fed.
104000	107760	I looked at a number of different studies that quantify the amounts of acrylamide in
107760	113280	various foods, and coffee is much lower than a lot of everyday foods the average person
113280	114560	consumes.
114560	120960	Unfortunately, the law doesn't necessarily conform to scientific norms or common sense.
120960	125440	The law requires that Starbucks, the lead defendant in the suit, had to show that coffee
125440	131920	posed no risk and wouldn't cause one or more cases of cancer for every 100,000 people.
131920	136560	So although there's no evidence that coffee is harmful, that's not enough for the courts.
136560	140280	The coffee companies have to show that it's not harmful.
140280	144680	Some have accused lawyers of taking advantage of the state regulation, which includes exemptions
144680	149320	for some chemicals that occur naturally in uncooked food, for settlement money.
149320	151720	Oh gee, do you think?
151720	157000	Just to declare my non-interest, I don't own shares in Starbucks or any coffee companies,
157000	161200	and to redress the balance and eliminate any perception of bias, I'd just like to add
161200	163600	that Starbucks coffee tastes like shit.
163600	168760	I asked a friend of mine living in the US why Americans are so enamoured with Starbucks,
168760	174240	and he said they'd spent so many decades drinking stewed day-old coffee out of brewing pots
174240	177920	that when crap coffee came along, they thought it was drinkable.
177920	180280	But anyway, back to the science.
180280	184800	It may not be the judge's fault, after all he has to follow the letter of the law, and
184800	189720	the letter of the law was not the result of well-thought-out science-based legislation,
189720	195400	it was the result of Proposition 65, proposed by people with a bad idea and voted for by
195400	197080	people with no idea.
197080	201800	Well, you don't want food legislation to be drafted by elitists who pass their chemistry
201800	203960	and medical degrees, do you?
203960	206600	So you get what you wish for.
206600	209100	Labelling known carcinogens is fine.
209100	214280	The problem with this silly law is that it casts its net so wide that known carcinogens
214280	219400	that really are cancerous get buried under the weight of relatively safe foods and drinks,
219400	221560	burdened with similar labels.
221560	223960	How are ordinary consumers supposed to know the difference?
223960	226960	Appreciative of the fact that they let you know, and then you make a decision.
226960	228740	Know what, Erica?
228740	232880	That the law supposes coffee might give you cancer when researchers have found no evidence
232880	233880	of that?
233880	238040	Then I guess Mr Bumble said it best in the Dickens novel Oliver Twist.
238040	243800	If the law supposes that, said Mr Bumble, squeezing his hat emphatically in both hands,
243800	246000	the law is a ass, a idiot.
