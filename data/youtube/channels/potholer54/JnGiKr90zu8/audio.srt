00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,040
Speaking during an October 2009 videoconference in Hong Kong,

2
00:00:04,040 --> 00:00:14,460
Supreme Master Ching Hai mentioned the many hazards of genetically modified organisms

3
00:00:14,460 --> 00:00:17,920
along with the need to avoid their use to ensure human welfare.

4
00:00:17,920 --> 00:00:24,160
Nowadays, many people try to do this so-called genetically modified food.

5
00:00:24,160 --> 00:00:27,900
So sometimes we eat the vegetarian food

6
00:00:27,900 --> 00:00:33,300
and we don't even know that there are animals' substances in it, scientifically speaking.

7
00:00:33,300 --> 00:00:37,180
Meat is being linked to disease of all kinds,

8
00:00:37,180 --> 00:00:41,220
with cholesterol, obesity, heart disease and strokes.

9
00:00:41,220 --> 00:00:47,820
So if we put meat or animals' substances into vegetables,

10
00:00:47,820 --> 00:00:51,420
then we will also have similar effects, more or less.

11
00:00:51,420 --> 00:00:53,120
Yeah, more or less.

12
00:00:53,120 --> 00:00:57,860
Inject meat into a healthy vegetable and you make it unhealthy.

13
00:00:57,860 --> 00:00:59,800
But here on The Pothole of 54 channel,

14
00:00:59,800 --> 00:01:05,300
we tend not to simply believe what masters tell us, even if they are supreme.

15
00:01:05,300 --> 00:01:09,040
We like to check the facts and see what the scientific research shows,

16
00:01:09,040 --> 00:01:12,680
as published in respected peer-reviewed journals.

17
00:01:12,680 --> 00:01:17,780
So let's try to find a slightly less emotional argument against genetically modified food.

18
00:01:17,780 --> 00:01:21,680
What happens when you consume plants that have been altered,

19
00:01:21,680 --> 00:01:26,720
artificially concocted in a laboratory by profit-driven scientists

20
00:01:26,720 --> 00:01:29,620
working for the most evil corporation in the world?

21
00:01:29,620 --> 00:01:34,620
LAUGHTER

22
00:01:52,480 --> 00:01:56,440
OK, let's leave the evil scientist to one side

23
00:01:56,440 --> 00:01:59,400
and take a look at some real science.

24
00:01:59,400 --> 00:02:03,840
Contrary to the images, GMOs aren't made by injecting meat or poison

25
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:06,280
or anything else into healthy plants.

26
00:02:06,280 --> 00:02:10,240
They're made by splicing part of the gene of one organism with another

27
00:02:10,240 --> 00:02:12,420
to pass on favourable traits.

28
00:02:12,420 --> 00:02:15,920
The reason they're in demand is that they endow plants with favourable traits

29
00:02:15,920 --> 00:02:21,060
like higher yield or pest resistance, or salt or drought tolerance.

30
00:02:21,060 --> 00:02:25,060
In theory, genetic modification shouldn't be harmful at all.

31
00:02:25,080 --> 00:02:30,320
After all, we ingest bits of DNA all the time, and have done for thousands of years.

32
00:02:30,320 --> 00:02:32,400
That's what our food is made of.

33
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:37,560
There's no reason why modifying a few nucleotides should have any effect at all,

34
00:02:37,560 --> 00:02:40,900
let alone turn us into hideous monsters.

35
00:02:40,900 --> 00:02:44,700
In the case of one type of genetically modified tomato, for example,

36
00:02:44,700 --> 00:02:49,440
a gene that produces the enzyme polygalactinase is deactivated.

37
00:02:49,440 --> 00:02:54,680
That stops the tomato softening, making it ripen closer to the time it's consumed.

38
00:02:54,700 --> 00:02:59,200
So will the lack of polygalactinase cause health problems?

39
00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:02,500
Well, most researchers say, why should it?

40
00:03:02,500 --> 00:03:06,480
People who don't eat tomatoes at all seem to do just fine.

41
00:03:06,480 --> 00:03:09,980
There isn't even a hypothesis to test or a mechanism

42
00:03:09,980 --> 00:03:13,760
by which the lack of polygalactinase might affect us.

43
00:03:13,760 --> 00:03:18,520
Even so, exhaustive studies have been done to look for any adverse health effects,

44
00:03:18,520 --> 00:03:21,220
and so far none has been found.

45
00:03:21,240 --> 00:03:26,940
In fact, the hyperbole of the anti-GMO campaign is what really scuppers their claims.

46
00:03:26,940 --> 00:03:32,880
Because if GMOs really are the cause of cancer, brain damage, metabolic collapse, and what else?

47
00:03:32,880 --> 00:03:36,080
Digestive disorders, organ damage, tumours, allergies...

48
00:03:36,080 --> 00:03:37,180
Yeah, right.

49
00:03:37,180 --> 00:03:40,920
Then that ought to show up among the billions of people and animals

50
00:03:40,920 --> 00:03:44,320
who've been consuming it over the last 20 to 30 years,

51
00:03:44,320 --> 00:03:46,860
compared to those who haven't.

52
00:03:46,860 --> 00:03:50,300
The studies that have been done have all drawn a blank.

53
00:03:50,340 --> 00:03:52,440
So let's try the opposite tack.

54
00:03:52,440 --> 00:03:56,820
Are there any studies that do show negative health effects from GMOs?

55
00:03:56,820 --> 00:04:02,220
Well, if there are, we ought to find them cited by the huge number of anti-GMO organisations

56
00:04:02,220 --> 00:04:04,760
that have sprung up in the last 30 years.

57
00:04:04,760 --> 00:04:10,020
But I have to warn you, the reason the opening of this video had a slightly mocking tone

58
00:04:10,020 --> 00:04:13,960
is that I've had to wade through a lot of nonsense to get to it.

59
00:04:13,960 --> 00:04:16,900
So here are a few warning signs.

60
00:04:16,900 --> 00:04:23,440
First, be wary of anyone who feels the need to dress up in order to impart scientific information.

61
00:04:23,440 --> 00:04:26,640
Especially when his lab coat looks like it's never been used.

62
00:04:26,640 --> 00:04:27,740
I'm part of a group of doctors.

63
00:04:27,740 --> 00:04:31,620
Second, be wary of someone who says he's part of a group of doctors,

64
00:04:31,620 --> 00:04:33,780
when in fact he's a chiropractor.

65
00:04:33,780 --> 00:04:36,760
...that are out bringing the truth about genetically modified foods.

66
00:04:36,760 --> 00:04:40,960
Thirdly, never trust anyone who tells you he's speaking the truth.

67
00:04:40,960 --> 00:04:44,960
Science depends on evidence that's consistent with a hypothesis.

68
00:04:45,020 --> 00:04:47,220
Truth is a religious concept.

69
00:04:47,220 --> 00:04:49,160
...and the harmful effects that it has on our health.

70
00:04:49,160 --> 00:04:51,800
And fourth, check the information.

71
00:04:51,800 --> 00:04:56,300
So in 1989, dozens of Americans actually died and thousands were affected

72
00:04:56,300 --> 00:05:00,200
and impaired by a genetically modified version of the food supplement L-tryptophan.

73
00:05:00,200 --> 00:05:04,340
But if we check this claim, we find that studies have concluded that the deaths

74
00:05:04,340 --> 00:05:07,180
were not caused by genetic modification.

75
00:05:07,180 --> 00:05:11,080
They were caused by contamination of the L-tryptophan.

76
00:05:11,100 --> 00:05:14,940
So while the chiropractor in the white coat is free to announce his belief

77
00:05:14,940 --> 00:05:17,820
that these illnesses were the result of GMO,

78
00:05:17,820 --> 00:05:21,120
he ought to admit that this is just his belief

79
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:25,160
and not the result of published scientific research.

80
00:05:25,160 --> 00:05:28,520
But if there is a study that shows GMOs are harmful,

81
00:05:28,520 --> 00:05:33,900
surely it would be among these ten studies that prove GMOs are harmful to human health,

82
00:05:33,900 --> 00:05:37,300
which has been cut and pasted all over the internet.

83
00:05:37,300 --> 00:05:39,660
Six of them fail at the first hurdle,

84
00:05:39,680 --> 00:05:43,320
because they aren't even studying the effects of GMOs on health,

85
00:05:43,320 --> 00:05:46,980
they're studying the effects of herbicides and pesticides.

86
00:05:46,980 --> 00:05:49,620
And anyway, one of these studies was so flawed,

87
00:05:49,620 --> 00:05:53,760
it was withdrawn from the journal Food and Chemical Toxicology.

88
00:05:53,760 --> 00:05:55,700
The argument goes like this.

89
00:05:55,700 --> 00:05:59,600
GMOs are designed to be resistant to pesticides and herbicides,

90
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:01,940
therefore allowing more of these chemicals to be used

91
00:06:01,940 --> 00:06:04,700
without endangering the health of the plants.

92
00:06:04,700 --> 00:06:07,900
And the residues from these chemicals may be unhealthy.

93
00:06:07,920 --> 00:06:10,420
Now all this may very well be correct,

94
00:06:10,420 --> 00:06:15,320
but this is not proof that GMOs themselves are dangerous or unhealthy,

95
00:06:15,320 --> 00:06:18,600
which is, after all, the claim being made.

96
00:06:18,600 --> 00:06:24,040
First of all, only some GMOs are designed to be resistant to pesticides and herbicides,

97
00:06:24,040 --> 00:06:26,540
others decrease the need for pesticides

98
00:06:26,540 --> 00:06:29,580
because they're engineered to be pest-resistant.

99
00:06:29,580 --> 00:06:33,820
And most GMOs have nothing to do with pesticides and herbicides at all,

100
00:06:33,820 --> 00:06:36,240
they're grown for completely different reasons,

101
00:06:36,260 --> 00:06:39,480
like rice that helps the body produce vitamin A,

102
00:06:39,480 --> 00:06:42,160
tomatoes that don't get squashed and spoiled,

103
00:06:42,160 --> 00:06:44,520
or drought-resistant maize.

104
00:06:44,520 --> 00:06:46,800
Of the remaining so-called proofs,

105
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:50,480
two are not published in respected peer-reviewed journals,

106
00:06:50,480 --> 00:06:54,380
by which I mean journals that are on the master journals list.

107
00:06:54,380 --> 00:06:58,960
I know a study by something called the Institute for Responsible Technology

108
00:06:58,960 --> 00:07:03,500
may sound like authoritative and meticulously researched science,

109
00:07:03,500 --> 00:07:06,720
but in fact it's an anti-GMO website.

110
00:07:06,720 --> 00:07:10,000
Giving your blog a fancy, sciency-sounding name

111
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:14,520
doesn't turn you into a respected peer-reviewed scientific journal.

112
00:07:14,520 --> 00:07:17,840
I'll look at the other study on pigs in a moment.

113
00:07:17,840 --> 00:07:20,580
Number ten consists of several documents,

114
00:07:20,580 --> 00:07:25,920
a review paper that includes research into the effect of herbicides, not GMOs,

115
00:07:25,920 --> 00:07:28,620
and a paper on research methodology.

116
00:07:28,620 --> 00:07:31,360
Once again, nothing that lives up to the title

117
00:07:31,360 --> 00:07:37,520
and constitutes any kind of evidence, let alone proof that GMOs are unsafe.

118
00:07:37,520 --> 00:07:41,440
Finally, the only paper from a respected scientific journal,

119
00:07:41,440 --> 00:07:44,560
and one that could possibly be related to GMOs,

120
00:07:44,560 --> 00:07:48,440
is number two on the list, a paper by Spisanc et al.

121
00:07:48,440 --> 00:07:53,720
It detected tiny amounts of DNA fragments floating around in the bloodstream.

122
00:07:53,720 --> 00:07:56,960
The DNA is not related to genetic modification,

123
00:07:56,960 --> 00:08:00,560
and the amounts are so small they could be due to contamination.

124
00:08:00,560 --> 00:08:03,400
But let's go with the conclusions of the paper.

125
00:08:03,400 --> 00:08:07,040
The fragments were predominantly found in people with inflamed stomachs

126
00:08:07,040 --> 00:08:08,920
due to Kawasaki disease.

127
00:08:08,920 --> 00:08:14,040
So why is this study proof that GMOs can be harmful to human health?

128
00:08:14,040 --> 00:08:17,000
The paper doesn't make any such conclusion.

129
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:21,120
After all, there are all sorts of bits of DNA floating around our bloodstream

130
00:08:21,120 --> 00:08:25,560
from dead cells, bacteria, viruses, and even from other humans.

131
00:08:25,560 --> 00:08:30,800
So why would bits of DNA from plants be any more or less of a concern?

132
00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:34,800
Well, the anti-GMO website kind of tells us.

133
00:08:34,800 --> 00:08:38,640
This still doesn't mean that GMOs can enter into our cells, it says.

134
00:08:38,640 --> 00:08:39,640
And that's right.

135
00:08:39,640 --> 00:08:43,160
In fact, there's no evidence at all that any of these bits of DNA

136
00:08:43,160 --> 00:08:44,920
are getting into our cells.

137
00:08:44,920 --> 00:08:46,800
And that's a pretty hard thing to do,

138
00:08:46,800 --> 00:08:51,560
unless they're bacteria or viruses fit for the purpose, which they're not.

139
00:08:51,560 --> 00:08:55,680
It's telling that the authors of this list aren't even proposing a hypothesis

140
00:08:55,680 --> 00:08:59,200
to show how these bits of DNA might infect a cell,

141
00:08:59,200 --> 00:09:02,560
and how and why this infected cell would then be harmful,

142
00:09:02,560 --> 00:09:06,400
and why it wouldn't be overwhelmed and killed by white blood cells.

143
00:09:06,400 --> 00:09:09,960
But given the fact GMOs have been linked to cancer...

144
00:09:09,960 --> 00:09:13,200
No, GMOs have not been linked to cancer.

145
00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:15,960
The link alluded to is one of the papers

146
00:09:15,960 --> 00:09:20,640
that deals with the weed killer glyphosate, not GMOs.

147
00:09:20,640 --> 00:09:23,840
This study demonstrates another cause for concern.

148
00:09:23,840 --> 00:09:25,160
Another cause?

149
00:09:25,160 --> 00:09:30,280
Again, none of these studies cited on the list supposedly proving GMOs are harmful

150
00:09:30,280 --> 00:09:34,000
have shown any evidence for that, let alone any proof.

151
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:38,440
And certainly they haven't shown any cause for concern about GMOs.

152
00:09:38,440 --> 00:09:43,720
Even the authors of the SPISAC paper don't think their discovery is any cause for concern,

153
00:09:43,720 --> 00:09:45,920
neither does the scientific community,

154
00:09:45,920 --> 00:09:49,480
since the paper's only been cited five times.

155
00:09:49,480 --> 00:09:54,160
However, if we ignore the hyperbole and talk seriously about the science,

156
00:09:54,160 --> 00:09:59,800
then the SPISAC paper should certainly be followed up with more research.

157
00:09:59,800 --> 00:10:01,120
So you see the problem.

158
00:10:01,120 --> 00:10:04,760
A list of ten studies proving GMOs are harmful

159
00:10:04,760 --> 00:10:08,960
can't come up with a single study published in a respected scientific journal

160
00:10:08,960 --> 00:10:11,400
showing that GMOs are harmful.

161
00:10:11,400 --> 00:10:13,920
That didn't end my search by any means.

162
00:10:13,920 --> 00:10:16,880
I kept trawling through the anti-GMO sites,

163
00:10:16,880 --> 00:10:19,480
but kept coming up with the same references,

164
00:10:19,480 --> 00:10:22,200
especially this one, number nine on the list,

165
00:10:22,200 --> 00:10:25,200
published in the Journal of Organic Systems.

166
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:27,960
Once again, the title sounds impressive,

167
00:10:27,960 --> 00:10:31,800
but this is an online journal started in 2006,

168
00:10:31,800 --> 00:10:34,400
and it's not on the master journals list,

169
00:10:34,400 --> 00:10:38,640
which made me wonder why it got the attention of the Reuters news agency,

170
00:10:38,640 --> 00:10:42,080
who echoed the claims of the authors without question.

171
00:10:42,080 --> 00:10:46,640
Scientists say new study shows pig health hurt by GMO feed.

172
00:10:46,640 --> 00:10:50,200
Something tells me that Carrie Gillum, who wrote the Reuters story,

173
00:10:50,200 --> 00:10:52,520
didn't actually read the paper.

174
00:10:52,520 --> 00:10:57,880
For one thing, her story seems to have simply copied and pasted what's in the abstract.

175
00:10:57,880 --> 00:11:02,240
Those pigs that ate the GM-Fed diet had a higher rate of severe stomach inflammation,

176
00:11:02,240 --> 00:11:05,360
with a rate of 32% of GM-Fed pigs,

177
00:11:05,360 --> 00:11:08,680
compared to 12% of non-GM-Fed pigs.

178
00:11:08,680 --> 00:11:12,080
The severe stomach inflammation was worse in GM-Fed males,

179
00:11:12,080 --> 00:11:15,640
compared to non-GM-Fed males, by a factor of four.

180
00:11:15,640 --> 00:11:21,360
And GM-Fed females, compared to non-GM-Fed females, by a factor of 2.2.

181
00:11:21,360 --> 00:11:25,640
If Gillum had bothered to find out where those figures came from in the paper,

182
00:11:25,640 --> 00:11:28,040
she might have noticed something odd.

183
00:11:28,040 --> 00:11:31,640
It's true, 23 pigs did have severe stomach inflammation,

184
00:11:31,640 --> 00:11:33,600
compared to nine who didn't.

185
00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:36,280
That's not a very large sample size,

186
00:11:36,280 --> 00:11:40,240
and that's where the 32% and 12% figures come from.

187
00:11:40,240 --> 00:11:44,320
What didn't make it into the abstract were the other stomach inflammation figures

188
00:11:44,320 --> 00:11:48,320
that could equally well suggest that GM foods are safer.

189
00:11:48,320 --> 00:11:54,480
After all, 60 pigs fed with non-GM food had mild or moderate stomach inflammation,

190
00:11:54,480 --> 00:11:58,840
compared to only 41 of the pigs fed with GM food.

191
00:11:58,840 --> 00:12:05,160
And the pigs fed with GM food were twice as likely to have no stomach inflammation altogether.

192
00:12:05,160 --> 00:12:06,920
Why? Who knows?

193
00:12:06,920 --> 00:12:10,000
The study contains no hypothesis to be tested,

194
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:12,200
the sample sizes are way too small,

195
00:12:12,200 --> 00:12:16,520
and consequently the results don't show any consistent pattern.

196
00:12:16,520 --> 00:12:19,600
But for some reason none of this made it into the abstract,

197
00:12:19,600 --> 00:12:22,240
the peer reviewer didn't seem to notice or care,

198
00:12:22,240 --> 00:12:27,840
and Carrie Gillum at Reuters simply parroted what she read at the top of the paper.

199
00:12:27,840 --> 00:12:32,360
But in the end I did find a reference to a study from a respected peer-reviewed journal,

200
00:12:32,360 --> 00:12:33,520
which might be relevant.

201
00:12:33,520 --> 00:12:41,120
Now here in Cell Research we have a new study called the exogenous plant MIR16A.

202
00:12:41,120 --> 00:12:44,080
And although many researchers are skeptical of the results,

203
00:12:44,080 --> 00:12:50,160
I can't find any responses indicating serious flaws in this paper by Zhang et al.

204
00:12:50,160 --> 00:12:56,440
The study found that microRNA found in rice can bind to receptors in mammalian livers,

205
00:12:56,440 --> 00:13:02,240
and potentially inhibit production of a protein in mice that removes bad cholesterol.

206
00:13:02,240 --> 00:13:03,720
But before we get carried away...

207
00:13:03,720 --> 00:13:07,200
It can alter the expression, the function of your organs, such as the liver,

208
00:13:07,200 --> 00:13:11,840
and possibly, in fact very likely, many other organs, including your brain,

209
00:13:11,840 --> 00:13:15,560
including fertility organs, including your kidneys, perhaps even your heart...

210
00:13:15,560 --> 00:13:18,560
No, I said before we get carried away.

211
00:13:18,560 --> 00:13:25,160
This was a study about microRNA found in ordinary rice, not genetically modified rice.

212
00:13:25,160 --> 00:13:31,400
So if anti-GMO activists are concerned about any effect this microRNA might have on humans,

213
00:13:31,400 --> 00:13:33,640
and there's no evidence it has any,

214
00:13:33,680 --> 00:13:37,920
perhaps they should run a campaign urging us not to eat rice.

215
00:13:37,920 --> 00:13:42,640
The Zhang paper is certainly interesting because it shows the potential for genes found

216
00:13:42,640 --> 00:13:48,200
in ordinary plants to work their way out of the gut and possibly find receptors in human organs,

217
00:13:48,200 --> 00:13:51,560
or at least in one particular case they might.

218
00:13:51,560 --> 00:13:56,040
I say potential and possibly because this is a very long way from discovering

219
00:13:56,040 --> 00:13:59,680
that this actually happens, and even further away from discovering

220
00:13:59,680 --> 00:14:02,200
that it has any adverse effects.

221
00:14:02,200 --> 00:14:06,000
And obviously a billion Chinese eat their stuff at least twice a day

222
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:09,880
for their entire lives and don't seem to be affected.

223
00:14:09,880 --> 00:14:14,600
Even so, as with the other study, it's definitely worth doing further research.

224
00:14:14,600 --> 00:14:18,040
And that goes for GMO research in general.

225
00:14:18,040 --> 00:14:22,440
In my humble opinion, and treat this as the ramblings of a drooling idiot

226
00:14:22,440 --> 00:14:26,200
because I'm just a science journalist, however confident we are

227
00:14:26,200 --> 00:14:31,680
and however many studies have been done, the safety of our food supply is so important

228
00:14:31,680 --> 00:14:37,280
that we should be constantly monitoring the health of populations and updating studies.

229
00:14:37,280 --> 00:14:45,200
We may be 99.9% sure, but there's no reason we shouldn't strive to be 99.99% sure.

230
00:14:45,200 --> 00:14:51,240
And in return maybe the anti-GMO campaigners could stop the hype and the scary claptrap

231
00:14:51,240 --> 00:14:54,960
and stop lumping all GMOs together as collectively bad.

232
00:14:54,960 --> 00:14:59,440
The more genetically modified food you consume, the less human you become.

233
00:14:59,520 --> 00:15:02,800
Oh no, what's happening to me? Am I dying?

234
00:15:02,800 --> 00:15:08,920
There's a huge difference between GMOs like Roundup Ready that may promote the use of more herbicides

235
00:15:08,920 --> 00:15:12,560
where it's the herbicides that could have health consequences

236
00:15:12,560 --> 00:15:18,160
and GMOs that promote the production of vitamin A in populations that are vitamin A deficient

237
00:15:18,160 --> 00:15:22,880
and GMOs that can be grown in areas that at the moment can't be cultivated.

238
00:15:22,880 --> 00:15:28,720
Let's have an honest and sensible debate based on the evidence in the scientific literature

239
00:15:28,720 --> 00:15:35,840
rather than a blanket attack on GMOs that misinforms and plays on people's fear and ignorance.

240
00:15:35,840 --> 00:15:43,280
There are things we should be concerned about like dioxin, PCBs, hormones and other contaminants in food

241
00:15:43,280 --> 00:15:48,240
and of course things like sea level rise, earthquakes, tsunami, climate change and viruses

242
00:15:48,240 --> 00:15:54,800
because these are all concerns based on facts and conclusions published in respected scientific journals.

243
00:15:54,800 --> 00:15:59,440
What we shouldn't be so concerned about are links between vaccines and autism,

244
00:15:59,440 --> 00:16:04,320
an imminent ice age or turning into pustulant zombies through eating GMOs

245
00:16:04,320 --> 00:16:10,320
because these concerns are not based on facts and conclusions published in respected scientific journals.

246
00:16:10,320 --> 00:16:14,800
They're based on poster campaigns, blogs and newspaper headlines.

247
00:16:14,800 --> 00:16:21,440
What I find fascinating is that the organisations embracing the scientific literature on the safety of GMOs

248
00:16:21,440 --> 00:16:24,560
like the Heartland Organisation and Fox News

249
00:16:24,560 --> 00:16:28,800
are the same organisations who rail against the scientific literature

250
00:16:28,800 --> 00:16:31,760
when it comes to climate change and evolution.

251
00:16:31,760 --> 00:16:39,600
To show that GMOs are safe, Forbes magazine cites the endorsement of just about every major scientific institution.

252
00:16:39,600 --> 00:16:45,120
But when the same scientific institutions endorse the link between CO2 and global temperature

253
00:16:45,120 --> 00:16:48,240
Forbes magazine is happy to ignore them.

254
00:16:48,240 --> 00:16:55,120
Conversely, the people urging us to accept the conclusions of researchers when it comes to climate change like Greenpeace

255
00:16:55,120 --> 00:17:02,240
are the same people who happily ignore the conclusions of researchers when it comes to the safety of GMOs.

256
00:17:02,240 --> 00:17:05,520
In other words, for extremists at both ends of the spectrum

257
00:17:05,520 --> 00:17:11,280
the acceptance of science is subordinate to an ideological or political position.

258
00:17:11,280 --> 00:17:16,480
I find it much easier to go with the science whether it fits my beliefs or not.
