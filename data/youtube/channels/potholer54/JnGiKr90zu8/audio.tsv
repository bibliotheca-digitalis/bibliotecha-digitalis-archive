0	4040	Speaking during an October 2009 videoconference in Hong Kong,
4040	14460	Supreme Master Ching Hai mentioned the many hazards of genetically modified organisms
14460	17920	along with the need to avoid their use to ensure human welfare.
17920	24160	Nowadays, many people try to do this so-called genetically modified food.
24160	27900	So sometimes we eat the vegetarian food
27900	33300	and we don't even know that there are animals' substances in it, scientifically speaking.
33300	37180	Meat is being linked to disease of all kinds,
37180	41220	with cholesterol, obesity, heart disease and strokes.
41220	47820	So if we put meat or animals' substances into vegetables,
47820	51420	then we will also have similar effects, more or less.
51420	53120	Yeah, more or less.
53120	57860	Inject meat into a healthy vegetable and you make it unhealthy.
57860	59800	But here on The Pothole of 54 channel,
59800	65300	we tend not to simply believe what masters tell us, even if they are supreme.
65300	69040	We like to check the facts and see what the scientific research shows,
69040	72680	as published in respected peer-reviewed journals.
72680	77780	So let's try to find a slightly less emotional argument against genetically modified food.
77780	81680	What happens when you consume plants that have been altered,
81680	86720	artificially concocted in a laboratory by profit-driven scientists
86720	89620	working for the most evil corporation in the world?
89620	94620	LAUGHTER
112480	116440	OK, let's leave the evil scientist to one side
116440	119400	and take a look at some real science.
119400	123840	Contrary to the images, GMOs aren't made by injecting meat or poison
123840	126280	or anything else into healthy plants.
126280	130240	They're made by splicing part of the gene of one organism with another
130240	132420	to pass on favourable traits.
132420	135920	The reason they're in demand is that they endow plants with favourable traits
135920	141060	like higher yield or pest resistance, or salt or drought tolerance.
141060	145060	In theory, genetic modification shouldn't be harmful at all.
145080	150320	After all, we ingest bits of DNA all the time, and have done for thousands of years.
150320	152400	That's what our food is made of.
152400	157560	There's no reason why modifying a few nucleotides should have any effect at all,
157560	160900	let alone turn us into hideous monsters.
160900	164700	In the case of one type of genetically modified tomato, for example,
164700	169440	a gene that produces the enzyme polygalactinase is deactivated.
169440	174680	That stops the tomato softening, making it ripen closer to the time it's consumed.
174700	179200	So will the lack of polygalactinase cause health problems?
179200	182500	Well, most researchers say, why should it?
182500	186480	People who don't eat tomatoes at all seem to do just fine.
186480	189980	There isn't even a hypothesis to test or a mechanism
189980	193760	by which the lack of polygalactinase might affect us.
193760	198520	Even so, exhaustive studies have been done to look for any adverse health effects,
198520	201220	and so far none has been found.
201240	206940	In fact, the hyperbole of the anti-GMO campaign is what really scuppers their claims.
206940	212880	Because if GMOs really are the cause of cancer, brain damage, metabolic collapse, and what else?
212880	216080	Digestive disorders, organ damage, tumours, allergies...
216080	217180	Yeah, right.
217180	220920	Then that ought to show up among the billions of people and animals
220920	224320	who've been consuming it over the last 20 to 30 years,
224320	226860	compared to those who haven't.
226860	230300	The studies that have been done have all drawn a blank.
230340	232440	So let's try the opposite tack.
232440	236820	Are there any studies that do show negative health effects from GMOs?
236820	242220	Well, if there are, we ought to find them cited by the huge number of anti-GMO organisations
242220	244760	that have sprung up in the last 30 years.
244760	250020	But I have to warn you, the reason the opening of this video had a slightly mocking tone
250020	253960	is that I've had to wade through a lot of nonsense to get to it.
253960	256900	So here are a few warning signs.
256900	263440	First, be wary of anyone who feels the need to dress up in order to impart scientific information.
263440	266640	Especially when his lab coat looks like it's never been used.
266640	267740	I'm part of a group of doctors.
267740	271620	Second, be wary of someone who says he's part of a group of doctors,
271620	273780	when in fact he's a chiropractor.
273780	276760	...that are out bringing the truth about genetically modified foods.
276760	280960	Thirdly, never trust anyone who tells you he's speaking the truth.
280960	284960	Science depends on evidence that's consistent with a hypothesis.
285020	287220	Truth is a religious concept.
287220	289160	...and the harmful effects that it has on our health.
289160	291800	And fourth, check the information.
291800	296300	So in 1989, dozens of Americans actually died and thousands were affected
296300	300200	and impaired by a genetically modified version of the food supplement L-tryptophan.
300200	304340	But if we check this claim, we find that studies have concluded that the deaths
304340	307180	were not caused by genetic modification.
307180	311080	They were caused by contamination of the L-tryptophan.
311100	314940	So while the chiropractor in the white coat is free to announce his belief
314940	317820	that these illnesses were the result of GMO,
317820	321120	he ought to admit that this is just his belief
321120	325160	and not the result of published scientific research.
325160	328520	But if there is a study that shows GMOs are harmful,
328520	333900	surely it would be among these ten studies that prove GMOs are harmful to human health,
333900	337300	which has been cut and pasted all over the internet.
337300	339660	Six of them fail at the first hurdle,
339680	343320	because they aren't even studying the effects of GMOs on health,
343320	346980	they're studying the effects of herbicides and pesticides.
346980	349620	And anyway, one of these studies was so flawed,
349620	353760	it was withdrawn from the journal Food and Chemical Toxicology.
353760	355700	The argument goes like this.
355700	359600	GMOs are designed to be resistant to pesticides and herbicides,
359600	361940	therefore allowing more of these chemicals to be used
361940	364700	without endangering the health of the plants.
364700	367900	And the residues from these chemicals may be unhealthy.
367920	370420	Now all this may very well be correct,
370420	375320	but this is not proof that GMOs themselves are dangerous or unhealthy,
375320	378600	which is, after all, the claim being made.
378600	384040	First of all, only some GMOs are designed to be resistant to pesticides and herbicides,
384040	386540	others decrease the need for pesticides
386540	389580	because they're engineered to be pest-resistant.
389580	393820	And most GMOs have nothing to do with pesticides and herbicides at all,
393820	396240	they're grown for completely different reasons,
396260	399480	like rice that helps the body produce vitamin A,
399480	402160	tomatoes that don't get squashed and spoiled,
402160	404520	or drought-resistant maize.
404520	406800	Of the remaining so-called proofs,
406800	410480	two are not published in respected peer-reviewed journals,
410480	414380	by which I mean journals that are on the master journals list.
414380	418960	I know a study by something called the Institute for Responsible Technology
418960	423500	may sound like authoritative and meticulously researched science,
423500	426720	but in fact it's an anti-GMO website.
426720	430000	Giving your blog a fancy, sciency-sounding name
430000	434520	doesn't turn you into a respected peer-reviewed scientific journal.
434520	437840	I'll look at the other study on pigs in a moment.
437840	440580	Number ten consists of several documents,
440580	445920	a review paper that includes research into the effect of herbicides, not GMOs,
445920	448620	and a paper on research methodology.
448620	451360	Once again, nothing that lives up to the title
451360	457520	and constitutes any kind of evidence, let alone proof that GMOs are unsafe.
457520	461440	Finally, the only paper from a respected scientific journal,
461440	464560	and one that could possibly be related to GMOs,
464560	468440	is number two on the list, a paper by Spisanc et al.
468440	473720	It detected tiny amounts of DNA fragments floating around in the bloodstream.
473720	476960	The DNA is not related to genetic modification,
476960	480560	and the amounts are so small they could be due to contamination.
480560	483400	But let's go with the conclusions of the paper.
483400	487040	The fragments were predominantly found in people with inflamed stomachs
487040	488920	due to Kawasaki disease.
488920	494040	So why is this study proof that GMOs can be harmful to human health?
494040	497000	The paper doesn't make any such conclusion.
497000	501120	After all, there are all sorts of bits of DNA floating around our bloodstream
501120	505560	from dead cells, bacteria, viruses, and even from other humans.
505560	510800	So why would bits of DNA from plants be any more or less of a concern?
510800	514800	Well, the anti-GMO website kind of tells us.
514800	518640	This still doesn't mean that GMOs can enter into our cells, it says.
518640	519640	And that's right.
519640	523160	In fact, there's no evidence at all that any of these bits of DNA
523160	524920	are getting into our cells.
524920	526800	And that's a pretty hard thing to do,
526800	531560	unless they're bacteria or viruses fit for the purpose, which they're not.
531560	535680	It's telling that the authors of this list aren't even proposing a hypothesis
535680	539200	to show how these bits of DNA might infect a cell,
539200	542560	and how and why this infected cell would then be harmful,
542560	546400	and why it wouldn't be overwhelmed and killed by white blood cells.
546400	549960	But given the fact GMOs have been linked to cancer...
549960	553200	No, GMOs have not been linked to cancer.
553200	555960	The link alluded to is one of the papers
555960	560640	that deals with the weed killer glyphosate, not GMOs.
560640	563840	This study demonstrates another cause for concern.
563840	565160	Another cause?
565160	570280	Again, none of these studies cited on the list supposedly proving GMOs are harmful
570280	574000	have shown any evidence for that, let alone any proof.
574000	578440	And certainly they haven't shown any cause for concern about GMOs.
578440	583720	Even the authors of the SPISAC paper don't think their discovery is any cause for concern,
583720	585920	neither does the scientific community,
585920	589480	since the paper's only been cited five times.
589480	594160	However, if we ignore the hyperbole and talk seriously about the science,
594160	599800	then the SPISAC paper should certainly be followed up with more research.
599800	601120	So you see the problem.
601120	604760	A list of ten studies proving GMOs are harmful
604760	608960	can't come up with a single study published in a respected scientific journal
608960	611400	showing that GMOs are harmful.
611400	613920	That didn't end my search by any means.
613920	616880	I kept trawling through the anti-GMO sites,
616880	619480	but kept coming up with the same references,
619480	622200	especially this one, number nine on the list,
622200	625200	published in the Journal of Organic Systems.
625200	627960	Once again, the title sounds impressive,
627960	631800	but this is an online journal started in 2006,
631800	634400	and it's not on the master journals list,
634400	638640	which made me wonder why it got the attention of the Reuters news agency,
638640	642080	who echoed the claims of the authors without question.
642080	646640	Scientists say new study shows pig health hurt by GMO feed.
646640	650200	Something tells me that Carrie Gillum, who wrote the Reuters story,
650200	652520	didn't actually read the paper.
652520	657880	For one thing, her story seems to have simply copied and pasted what's in the abstract.
657880	662240	Those pigs that ate the GM-Fed diet had a higher rate of severe stomach inflammation,
662240	665360	with a rate of 32% of GM-Fed pigs,
665360	668680	compared to 12% of non-GM-Fed pigs.
668680	672080	The severe stomach inflammation was worse in GM-Fed males,
672080	675640	compared to non-GM-Fed males, by a factor of four.
675640	681360	And GM-Fed females, compared to non-GM-Fed females, by a factor of 2.2.
681360	685640	If Gillum had bothered to find out where those figures came from in the paper,
685640	688040	she might have noticed something odd.
688040	691640	It's true, 23 pigs did have severe stomach inflammation,
691640	693600	compared to nine who didn't.
693600	696280	That's not a very large sample size,
696280	700240	and that's where the 32% and 12% figures come from.
700240	704320	What didn't make it into the abstract were the other stomach inflammation figures
704320	708320	that could equally well suggest that GM foods are safer.
708320	714480	After all, 60 pigs fed with non-GM food had mild or moderate stomach inflammation,
714480	718840	compared to only 41 of the pigs fed with GM food.
718840	725160	And the pigs fed with GM food were twice as likely to have no stomach inflammation altogether.
725160	726920	Why? Who knows?
726920	730000	The study contains no hypothesis to be tested,
730000	732200	the sample sizes are way too small,
732200	736520	and consequently the results don't show any consistent pattern.
736520	739600	But for some reason none of this made it into the abstract,
739600	742240	the peer reviewer didn't seem to notice or care,
742240	747840	and Carrie Gillum at Reuters simply parroted what she read at the top of the paper.
747840	752360	But in the end I did find a reference to a study from a respected peer-reviewed journal,
752360	753520	which might be relevant.
753520	761120	Now here in Cell Research we have a new study called the exogenous plant MIR16A.
761120	764080	And although many researchers are skeptical of the results,
764080	770160	I can't find any responses indicating serious flaws in this paper by Zhang et al.
770160	776440	The study found that microRNA found in rice can bind to receptors in mammalian livers,
776440	782240	and potentially inhibit production of a protein in mice that removes bad cholesterol.
782240	783720	But before we get carried away...
783720	787200	It can alter the expression, the function of your organs, such as the liver,
787200	791840	and possibly, in fact very likely, many other organs, including your brain,
791840	795560	including fertility organs, including your kidneys, perhaps even your heart...
795560	798560	No, I said before we get carried away.
798560	805160	This was a study about microRNA found in ordinary rice, not genetically modified rice.
805160	811400	So if anti-GMO activists are concerned about any effect this microRNA might have on humans,
811400	813640	and there's no evidence it has any,
813680	817920	perhaps they should run a campaign urging us not to eat rice.
817920	822640	The Zhang paper is certainly interesting because it shows the potential for genes found
822640	828200	in ordinary plants to work their way out of the gut and possibly find receptors in human organs,
828200	831560	or at least in one particular case they might.
831560	836040	I say potential and possibly because this is a very long way from discovering
836040	839680	that this actually happens, and even further away from discovering
839680	842200	that it has any adverse effects.
842200	846000	And obviously a billion Chinese eat their stuff at least twice a day
846000	849880	for their entire lives and don't seem to be affected.
849880	854600	Even so, as with the other study, it's definitely worth doing further research.
854600	858040	And that goes for GMO research in general.
858040	862440	In my humble opinion, and treat this as the ramblings of a drooling idiot
862440	866200	because I'm just a science journalist, however confident we are
866200	871680	and however many studies have been done, the safety of our food supply is so important
871680	877280	that we should be constantly monitoring the health of populations and updating studies.
877280	885200	We may be 99.9% sure, but there's no reason we shouldn't strive to be 99.99% sure.
885200	891240	And in return maybe the anti-GMO campaigners could stop the hype and the scary claptrap
891240	894960	and stop lumping all GMOs together as collectively bad.
894960	899440	The more genetically modified food you consume, the less human you become.
899520	902800	Oh no, what's happening to me? Am I dying?
902800	908920	There's a huge difference between GMOs like Roundup Ready that may promote the use of more herbicides
908920	912560	where it's the herbicides that could have health consequences
912560	918160	and GMOs that promote the production of vitamin A in populations that are vitamin A deficient
918160	922880	and GMOs that can be grown in areas that at the moment can't be cultivated.
922880	928720	Let's have an honest and sensible debate based on the evidence in the scientific literature
928720	935840	rather than a blanket attack on GMOs that misinforms and plays on people's fear and ignorance.
935840	943280	There are things we should be concerned about like dioxin, PCBs, hormones and other contaminants in food
943280	948240	and of course things like sea level rise, earthquakes, tsunami, climate change and viruses
948240	954800	because these are all concerns based on facts and conclusions published in respected scientific journals.
954800	959440	What we shouldn't be so concerned about are links between vaccines and autism,
959440	964320	an imminent ice age or turning into pustulant zombies through eating GMOs
964320	970320	because these concerns are not based on facts and conclusions published in respected scientific journals.
970320	974800	They're based on poster campaigns, blogs and newspaper headlines.
974800	981440	What I find fascinating is that the organisations embracing the scientific literature on the safety of GMOs
981440	984560	like the Heartland Organisation and Fox News
984560	988800	are the same organisations who rail against the scientific literature
988800	991760	when it comes to climate change and evolution.
991760	999600	To show that GMOs are safe, Forbes magazine cites the endorsement of just about every major scientific institution.
999600	1005120	But when the same scientific institutions endorse the link between CO2 and global temperature
1005120	1008240	Forbes magazine is happy to ignore them.
1008240	1015120	Conversely, the people urging us to accept the conclusions of researchers when it comes to climate change like Greenpeace
1015120	1022240	are the same people who happily ignore the conclusions of researchers when it comes to the safety of GMOs.
1022240	1025520	In other words, for extremists at both ends of the spectrum
1025520	1031280	the acceptance of science is subordinate to an ideological or political position.
1031280	1036480	I find it much easier to go with the science whether it fits my beliefs or not.
