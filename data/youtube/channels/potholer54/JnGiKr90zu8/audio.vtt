00:00.000 --> 00:04.040
Speaking during an October 2009 videoconference in Hong Kong,

00:04.040 --> 00:14.460
Supreme Master Ching Hai mentioned the many hazards of genetically modified organisms

00:14.460 --> 00:17.920
along with the need to avoid their use to ensure human welfare.

00:17.920 --> 00:24.160
Nowadays, many people try to do this so-called genetically modified food.

00:24.160 --> 00:27.900
So sometimes we eat the vegetarian food

00:27.900 --> 00:33.300
and we don't even know that there are animals' substances in it, scientifically speaking.

00:33.300 --> 00:37.180
Meat is being linked to disease of all kinds,

00:37.180 --> 00:41.220
with cholesterol, obesity, heart disease and strokes.

00:41.220 --> 00:47.820
So if we put meat or animals' substances into vegetables,

00:47.820 --> 00:51.420
then we will also have similar effects, more or less.

00:51.420 --> 00:53.120
Yeah, more or less.

00:53.120 --> 00:57.860
Inject meat into a healthy vegetable and you make it unhealthy.

00:57.860 --> 00:59.800
But here on The Pothole of 54 channel,

00:59.800 --> 01:05.300
we tend not to simply believe what masters tell us, even if they are supreme.

01:05.300 --> 01:09.040
We like to check the facts and see what the scientific research shows,

01:09.040 --> 01:12.680
as published in respected peer-reviewed journals.

01:12.680 --> 01:17.780
So let's try to find a slightly less emotional argument against genetically modified food.

01:17.780 --> 01:21.680
What happens when you consume plants that have been altered,

01:21.680 --> 01:26.720
artificially concocted in a laboratory by profit-driven scientists

01:26.720 --> 01:29.620
working for the most evil corporation in the world?

01:29.620 --> 01:34.620
LAUGHTER

01:52.480 --> 01:56.440
OK, let's leave the evil scientist to one side

01:56.440 --> 01:59.400
and take a look at some real science.

01:59.400 --> 02:03.840
Contrary to the images, GMOs aren't made by injecting meat or poison

02:03.840 --> 02:06.280
or anything else into healthy plants.

02:06.280 --> 02:10.240
They're made by splicing part of the gene of one organism with another

02:10.240 --> 02:12.420
to pass on favourable traits.

02:12.420 --> 02:15.920
The reason they're in demand is that they endow plants with favourable traits

02:15.920 --> 02:21.060
like higher yield or pest resistance, or salt or drought tolerance.

02:21.060 --> 02:25.060
In theory, genetic modification shouldn't be harmful at all.

02:25.080 --> 02:30.320
After all, we ingest bits of DNA all the time, and have done for thousands of years.

02:30.320 --> 02:32.400
That's what our food is made of.

02:32.400 --> 02:37.560
There's no reason why modifying a few nucleotides should have any effect at all,

02:37.560 --> 02:40.900
let alone turn us into hideous monsters.

02:40.900 --> 02:44.700
In the case of one type of genetically modified tomato, for example,

02:44.700 --> 02:49.440
a gene that produces the enzyme polygalactinase is deactivated.

02:49.440 --> 02:54.680
That stops the tomato softening, making it ripen closer to the time it's consumed.

02:54.700 --> 02:59.200
So will the lack of polygalactinase cause health problems?

02:59.200 --> 03:02.500
Well, most researchers say, why should it?

03:02.500 --> 03:06.480
People who don't eat tomatoes at all seem to do just fine.

03:06.480 --> 03:09.980
There isn't even a hypothesis to test or a mechanism

03:09.980 --> 03:13.760
by which the lack of polygalactinase might affect us.

03:13.760 --> 03:18.520
Even so, exhaustive studies have been done to look for any adverse health effects,

03:18.520 --> 03:21.220
and so far none has been found.

03:21.240 --> 03:26.940
In fact, the hyperbole of the anti-GMO campaign is what really scuppers their claims.

03:26.940 --> 03:32.880
Because if GMOs really are the cause of cancer, brain damage, metabolic collapse, and what else?

03:32.880 --> 03:36.080
Digestive disorders, organ damage, tumours, allergies...

03:36.080 --> 03:37.180
Yeah, right.

03:37.180 --> 03:40.920
Then that ought to show up among the billions of people and animals

03:40.920 --> 03:44.320
who've been consuming it over the last 20 to 30 years,

03:44.320 --> 03:46.860
compared to those who haven't.

03:46.860 --> 03:50.300
The studies that have been done have all drawn a blank.

03:50.340 --> 03:52.440
So let's try the opposite tack.

03:52.440 --> 03:56.820
Are there any studies that do show negative health effects from GMOs?

03:56.820 --> 04:02.220
Well, if there are, we ought to find them cited by the huge number of anti-GMO organisations

04:02.220 --> 04:04.760
that have sprung up in the last 30 years.

04:04.760 --> 04:10.020
But I have to warn you, the reason the opening of this video had a slightly mocking tone

04:10.020 --> 04:13.960
is that I've had to wade through a lot of nonsense to get to it.

04:13.960 --> 04:16.900
So here are a few warning signs.

04:16.900 --> 04:23.440
First, be wary of anyone who feels the need to dress up in order to impart scientific information.

04:23.440 --> 04:26.640
Especially when his lab coat looks like it's never been used.

04:26.640 --> 04:27.740
I'm part of a group of doctors.

04:27.740 --> 04:31.620
Second, be wary of someone who says he's part of a group of doctors,

04:31.620 --> 04:33.780
when in fact he's a chiropractor.

04:33.780 --> 04:36.760
...that are out bringing the truth about genetically modified foods.

04:36.760 --> 04:40.960
Thirdly, never trust anyone who tells you he's speaking the truth.

04:40.960 --> 04:44.960
Science depends on evidence that's consistent with a hypothesis.

04:45.020 --> 04:47.220
Truth is a religious concept.

04:47.220 --> 04:49.160
...and the harmful effects that it has on our health.

04:49.160 --> 04:51.800
And fourth, check the information.

04:51.800 --> 04:56.300
So in 1989, dozens of Americans actually died and thousands were affected

04:56.300 --> 05:00.200
and impaired by a genetically modified version of the food supplement L-tryptophan.

05:00.200 --> 05:04.340
But if we check this claim, we find that studies have concluded that the deaths

05:04.340 --> 05:07.180
were not caused by genetic modification.

05:07.180 --> 05:11.080
They were caused by contamination of the L-tryptophan.

05:11.100 --> 05:14.940
So while the chiropractor in the white coat is free to announce his belief

05:14.940 --> 05:17.820
that these illnesses were the result of GMO,

05:17.820 --> 05:21.120
he ought to admit that this is just his belief

05:21.120 --> 05:25.160
and not the result of published scientific research.

05:25.160 --> 05:28.520
But if there is a study that shows GMOs are harmful,

05:28.520 --> 05:33.900
surely it would be among these ten studies that prove GMOs are harmful to human health,

05:33.900 --> 05:37.300
which has been cut and pasted all over the internet.

05:37.300 --> 05:39.660
Six of them fail at the first hurdle,

05:39.680 --> 05:43.320
because they aren't even studying the effects of GMOs on health,

05:43.320 --> 05:46.980
they're studying the effects of herbicides and pesticides.

05:46.980 --> 05:49.620
And anyway, one of these studies was so flawed,

05:49.620 --> 05:53.760
it was withdrawn from the journal Food and Chemical Toxicology.

05:53.760 --> 05:55.700
The argument goes like this.

05:55.700 --> 05:59.600
GMOs are designed to be resistant to pesticides and herbicides,

05:59.600 --> 06:01.940
therefore allowing more of these chemicals to be used

06:01.940 --> 06:04.700
without endangering the health of the plants.

06:04.700 --> 06:07.900
And the residues from these chemicals may be unhealthy.

06:07.920 --> 06:10.420
Now all this may very well be correct,

06:10.420 --> 06:15.320
but this is not proof that GMOs themselves are dangerous or unhealthy,

06:15.320 --> 06:18.600
which is, after all, the claim being made.

06:18.600 --> 06:24.040
First of all, only some GMOs are designed to be resistant to pesticides and herbicides,

06:24.040 --> 06:26.540
others decrease the need for pesticides

06:26.540 --> 06:29.580
because they're engineered to be pest-resistant.

06:29.580 --> 06:33.820
And most GMOs have nothing to do with pesticides and herbicides at all,

06:33.820 --> 06:36.240
they're grown for completely different reasons,

06:36.260 --> 06:39.480
like rice that helps the body produce vitamin A,

06:39.480 --> 06:42.160
tomatoes that don't get squashed and spoiled,

06:42.160 --> 06:44.520
or drought-resistant maize.

06:44.520 --> 06:46.800
Of the remaining so-called proofs,

06:46.800 --> 06:50.480
two are not published in respected peer-reviewed journals,

06:50.480 --> 06:54.380
by which I mean journals that are on the master journals list.

06:54.380 --> 06:58.960
I know a study by something called the Institute for Responsible Technology

06:58.960 --> 07:03.500
may sound like authoritative and meticulously researched science,

07:03.500 --> 07:06.720
but in fact it's an anti-GMO website.

07:06.720 --> 07:10.000
Giving your blog a fancy, sciency-sounding name

07:10.000 --> 07:14.520
doesn't turn you into a respected peer-reviewed scientific journal.

07:14.520 --> 07:17.840
I'll look at the other study on pigs in a moment.

07:17.840 --> 07:20.580
Number ten consists of several documents,

07:20.580 --> 07:25.920
a review paper that includes research into the effect of herbicides, not GMOs,

07:25.920 --> 07:28.620
and a paper on research methodology.

07:28.620 --> 07:31.360
Once again, nothing that lives up to the title

07:31.360 --> 07:37.520
and constitutes any kind of evidence, let alone proof that GMOs are unsafe.

07:37.520 --> 07:41.440
Finally, the only paper from a respected scientific journal,

07:41.440 --> 07:44.560
and one that could possibly be related to GMOs,

07:44.560 --> 07:48.440
is number two on the list, a paper by Spisanc et al.

07:48.440 --> 07:53.720
It detected tiny amounts of DNA fragments floating around in the bloodstream.

07:53.720 --> 07:56.960
The DNA is not related to genetic modification,

07:56.960 --> 08:00.560
and the amounts are so small they could be due to contamination.

08:00.560 --> 08:03.400
But let's go with the conclusions of the paper.

08:03.400 --> 08:07.040
The fragments were predominantly found in people with inflamed stomachs

08:07.040 --> 08:08.920
due to Kawasaki disease.

08:08.920 --> 08:14.040
So why is this study proof that GMOs can be harmful to human health?

08:14.040 --> 08:17.000
The paper doesn't make any such conclusion.

08:17.000 --> 08:21.120
After all, there are all sorts of bits of DNA floating around our bloodstream

08:21.120 --> 08:25.560
from dead cells, bacteria, viruses, and even from other humans.

08:25.560 --> 08:30.800
So why would bits of DNA from plants be any more or less of a concern?

08:30.800 --> 08:34.800
Well, the anti-GMO website kind of tells us.

08:34.800 --> 08:38.640
This still doesn't mean that GMOs can enter into our cells, it says.

08:38.640 --> 08:39.640
And that's right.

08:39.640 --> 08:43.160
In fact, there's no evidence at all that any of these bits of DNA

08:43.160 --> 08:44.920
are getting into our cells.

08:44.920 --> 08:46.800
And that's a pretty hard thing to do,

08:46.800 --> 08:51.560
unless they're bacteria or viruses fit for the purpose, which they're not.

08:51.560 --> 08:55.680
It's telling that the authors of this list aren't even proposing a hypothesis

08:55.680 --> 08:59.200
to show how these bits of DNA might infect a cell,

08:59.200 --> 09:02.560
and how and why this infected cell would then be harmful,

09:02.560 --> 09:06.400
and why it wouldn't be overwhelmed and killed by white blood cells.

09:06.400 --> 09:09.960
But given the fact GMOs have been linked to cancer...

09:09.960 --> 09:13.200
No, GMOs have not been linked to cancer.

09:13.200 --> 09:15.960
The link alluded to is one of the papers

09:15.960 --> 09:20.640
that deals with the weed killer glyphosate, not GMOs.

09:20.640 --> 09:23.840
This study demonstrates another cause for concern.

09:23.840 --> 09:25.160
Another cause?

09:25.160 --> 09:30.280
Again, none of these studies cited on the list supposedly proving GMOs are harmful

09:30.280 --> 09:34.000
have shown any evidence for that, let alone any proof.

09:34.000 --> 09:38.440
And certainly they haven't shown any cause for concern about GMOs.

09:38.440 --> 09:43.720
Even the authors of the SPISAC paper don't think their discovery is any cause for concern,

09:43.720 --> 09:45.920
neither does the scientific community,

09:45.920 --> 09:49.480
since the paper's only been cited five times.

09:49.480 --> 09:54.160
However, if we ignore the hyperbole and talk seriously about the science,

09:54.160 --> 09:59.800
then the SPISAC paper should certainly be followed up with more research.

09:59.800 --> 10:01.120
So you see the problem.

10:01.120 --> 10:04.760
A list of ten studies proving GMOs are harmful

10:04.760 --> 10:08.960
can't come up with a single study published in a respected scientific journal

10:08.960 --> 10:11.400
showing that GMOs are harmful.

10:11.400 --> 10:13.920
That didn't end my search by any means.

10:13.920 --> 10:16.880
I kept trawling through the anti-GMO sites,

10:16.880 --> 10:19.480
but kept coming up with the same references,

10:19.480 --> 10:22.200
especially this one, number nine on the list,

10:22.200 --> 10:25.200
published in the Journal of Organic Systems.

10:25.200 --> 10:27.960
Once again, the title sounds impressive,

10:27.960 --> 10:31.800
but this is an online journal started in 2006,

10:31.800 --> 10:34.400
and it's not on the master journals list,

10:34.400 --> 10:38.640
which made me wonder why it got the attention of the Reuters news agency,

10:38.640 --> 10:42.080
who echoed the claims of the authors without question.

10:42.080 --> 10:46.640
Scientists say new study shows pig health hurt by GMO feed.

10:46.640 --> 10:50.200
Something tells me that Carrie Gillum, who wrote the Reuters story,

10:50.200 --> 10:52.520
didn't actually read the paper.

10:52.520 --> 10:57.880
For one thing, her story seems to have simply copied and pasted what's in the abstract.

10:57.880 --> 11:02.240
Those pigs that ate the GM-Fed diet had a higher rate of severe stomach inflammation,

11:02.240 --> 11:05.360
with a rate of 32% of GM-Fed pigs,

11:05.360 --> 11:08.680
compared to 12% of non-GM-Fed pigs.

11:08.680 --> 11:12.080
The severe stomach inflammation was worse in GM-Fed males,

11:12.080 --> 11:15.640
compared to non-GM-Fed males, by a factor of four.

11:15.640 --> 11:21.360
And GM-Fed females, compared to non-GM-Fed females, by a factor of 2.2.

11:21.360 --> 11:25.640
If Gillum had bothered to find out where those figures came from in the paper,

11:25.640 --> 11:28.040
she might have noticed something odd.

11:28.040 --> 11:31.640
It's true, 23 pigs did have severe stomach inflammation,

11:31.640 --> 11:33.600
compared to nine who didn't.

11:33.600 --> 11:36.280
That's not a very large sample size,

11:36.280 --> 11:40.240
and that's where the 32% and 12% figures come from.

11:40.240 --> 11:44.320
What didn't make it into the abstract were the other stomach inflammation figures

11:44.320 --> 11:48.320
that could equally well suggest that GM foods are safer.

11:48.320 --> 11:54.480
After all, 60 pigs fed with non-GM food had mild or moderate stomach inflammation,

11:54.480 --> 11:58.840
compared to only 41 of the pigs fed with GM food.

11:58.840 --> 12:05.160
And the pigs fed with GM food were twice as likely to have no stomach inflammation altogether.

12:05.160 --> 12:06.920
Why? Who knows?

12:06.920 --> 12:10.000
The study contains no hypothesis to be tested,

12:10.000 --> 12:12.200
the sample sizes are way too small,

12:12.200 --> 12:16.520
and consequently the results don't show any consistent pattern.

12:16.520 --> 12:19.600
But for some reason none of this made it into the abstract,

12:19.600 --> 12:22.240
the peer reviewer didn't seem to notice or care,

12:22.240 --> 12:27.840
and Carrie Gillum at Reuters simply parroted what she read at the top of the paper.

12:27.840 --> 12:32.360
But in the end I did find a reference to a study from a respected peer-reviewed journal,

12:32.360 --> 12:33.520
which might be relevant.

12:33.520 --> 12:41.120
Now here in Cell Research we have a new study called the exogenous plant MIR16A.

12:41.120 --> 12:44.080
And although many researchers are skeptical of the results,

12:44.080 --> 12:50.160
I can't find any responses indicating serious flaws in this paper by Zhang et al.

12:50.160 --> 12:56.440
The study found that microRNA found in rice can bind to receptors in mammalian livers,

12:56.440 --> 13:02.240
and potentially inhibit production of a protein in mice that removes bad cholesterol.

13:02.240 --> 13:03.720
But before we get carried away...

13:03.720 --> 13:07.200
It can alter the expression, the function of your organs, such as the liver,

13:07.200 --> 13:11.840
and possibly, in fact very likely, many other organs, including your brain,

13:11.840 --> 13:15.560
including fertility organs, including your kidneys, perhaps even your heart...

13:15.560 --> 13:18.560
No, I said before we get carried away.

13:18.560 --> 13:25.160
This was a study about microRNA found in ordinary rice, not genetically modified rice.

13:25.160 --> 13:31.400
So if anti-GMO activists are concerned about any effect this microRNA might have on humans,

13:31.400 --> 13:33.640
and there's no evidence it has any,

13:33.680 --> 13:37.920
perhaps they should run a campaign urging us not to eat rice.

13:37.920 --> 13:42.640
The Zhang paper is certainly interesting because it shows the potential for genes found

13:42.640 --> 13:48.200
in ordinary plants to work their way out of the gut and possibly find receptors in human organs,

13:48.200 --> 13:51.560
or at least in one particular case they might.

13:51.560 --> 13:56.040
I say potential and possibly because this is a very long way from discovering

13:56.040 --> 13:59.680
that this actually happens, and even further away from discovering

13:59.680 --> 14:02.200
that it has any adverse effects.

14:02.200 --> 14:06.000
And obviously a billion Chinese eat their stuff at least twice a day

14:06.000 --> 14:09.880
for their entire lives and don't seem to be affected.

14:09.880 --> 14:14.600
Even so, as with the other study, it's definitely worth doing further research.

14:14.600 --> 14:18.040
And that goes for GMO research in general.

14:18.040 --> 14:22.440
In my humble opinion, and treat this as the ramblings of a drooling idiot

14:22.440 --> 14:26.200
because I'm just a science journalist, however confident we are

14:26.200 --> 14:31.680
and however many studies have been done, the safety of our food supply is so important

14:31.680 --> 14:37.280
that we should be constantly monitoring the health of populations and updating studies.

14:37.280 --> 14:45.200
We may be 99.9% sure, but there's no reason we shouldn't strive to be 99.99% sure.

14:45.200 --> 14:51.240
And in return maybe the anti-GMO campaigners could stop the hype and the scary claptrap

14:51.240 --> 14:54.960
and stop lumping all GMOs together as collectively bad.

14:54.960 --> 14:59.440
The more genetically modified food you consume, the less human you become.

14:59.520 --> 15:02.800
Oh no, what's happening to me? Am I dying?

15:02.800 --> 15:08.920
There's a huge difference between GMOs like Roundup Ready that may promote the use of more herbicides

15:08.920 --> 15:12.560
where it's the herbicides that could have health consequences

15:12.560 --> 15:18.160
and GMOs that promote the production of vitamin A in populations that are vitamin A deficient

15:18.160 --> 15:22.880
and GMOs that can be grown in areas that at the moment can't be cultivated.

15:22.880 --> 15:28.720
Let's have an honest and sensible debate based on the evidence in the scientific literature

15:28.720 --> 15:35.840
rather than a blanket attack on GMOs that misinforms and plays on people's fear and ignorance.

15:35.840 --> 15:43.280
There are things we should be concerned about like dioxin, PCBs, hormones and other contaminants in food

15:43.280 --> 15:48.240
and of course things like sea level rise, earthquakes, tsunami, climate change and viruses

15:48.240 --> 15:54.800
because these are all concerns based on facts and conclusions published in respected scientific journals.

15:54.800 --> 15:59.440
What we shouldn't be so concerned about are links between vaccines and autism,

15:59.440 --> 16:04.320
an imminent ice age or turning into pustulant zombies through eating GMOs

16:04.320 --> 16:10.320
because these concerns are not based on facts and conclusions published in respected scientific journals.

16:10.320 --> 16:14.800
They're based on poster campaigns, blogs and newspaper headlines.

16:14.800 --> 16:21.440
What I find fascinating is that the organisations embracing the scientific literature on the safety of GMOs

16:21.440 --> 16:24.560
like the Heartland Organisation and Fox News

16:24.560 --> 16:28.800
are the same organisations who rail against the scientific literature

16:28.800 --> 16:31.760
when it comes to climate change and evolution.

16:31.760 --> 16:39.600
To show that GMOs are safe, Forbes magazine cites the endorsement of just about every major scientific institution.

16:39.600 --> 16:45.120
But when the same scientific institutions endorse the link between CO2 and global temperature

16:45.120 --> 16:48.240
Forbes magazine is happy to ignore them.

16:48.240 --> 16:55.120
Conversely, the people urging us to accept the conclusions of researchers when it comes to climate change like Greenpeace

16:55.120 --> 17:02.240
are the same people who happily ignore the conclusions of researchers when it comes to the safety of GMOs.

17:02.240 --> 17:05.520
In other words, for extremists at both ends of the spectrum

17:05.520 --> 17:11.280
the acceptance of science is subordinate to an ideological or political position.

17:11.280 --> 17:16.480
I find it much easier to go with the science whether it fits my beliefs or not.
