0	6540	There is a discrepancy between what the observations are showing, which shows about an average
6540	13720	of 0.13 degrees C per decade warming, which is a very small number, compared to the climate
13720	17580	models which are generally twice that at least.
17580	22220	My thanks to those who cited this interview with Roy Spencer a few weeks back, claiming
22220	25460	that global warming is far less than models predicted.
26000	30260	Actually, he's been saying the same thing for three decades, and in this video I'll
30260	34940	look at that claim. So let's start with whether measurements show that the Earth's temperature
34940	43080	is rising at 0.13 degrees C per decade. The answer is yes, if we only look at Roy Spencer
43080	49340	and John Christie's analysis of the satellite data at the University of Alabama at Huntsville,
50340	55980	If we look at all the other temperature monitoring bodies, they all show warming of about 0.18
55980	62280	degrees C per decade. If you think satellites are more reliable than ground stations, well
62280	67600	the analysis by the other satellite monitoring body, Remote Sensing Systems, that's the
67600	75080	purple line at the top, also shows warming of about 0.18 degrees C per decade.
75080	80880	Radiosonde balloons, which, like the satellites, are measuring temperatures in the lower troposphere,
80880	86880	show even higher rates of warming. And an average of all the tropospheric measurements,
86880	94020	including Spencer's UAH analysis, gives a warming trend of, again, 0.18 degrees C per
94020	100580	decade. And the temperature trend conforms pretty well to the predictions of the models.
100580	105500	Several independent studies have been done, and they've found a close match. The most
105500	112220	recent study, a 2020 analysis in Geophysical Research Letters, found that 14 out of 17
112220	118240	models closely matched observations for a given concentration of CO2. For a more detailed
118240	123420	explanation of their results, please see the video description with a link to the study.
123420	128940	All my sources are listed in the video description, along with links.
128980	134180	A couple of the models reviewed are more than twice the temperature trend Spencer calculated,
134180	141500	which would be over 0.26 degrees C per decade, but there's also one that's way under, so
141500	147500	it's very easy to cherry pick. But the fact is that most of the models match the actual
147500	152680	trend shown by every temperature dataset except Spencer's.
152680	156740	So the next question is, how reliable is Spencer's analysis?
156740	160380	The advantage to it is that it's from satellites and it covers the whole Earth. There's no
160380	163420	other temperature dataset that covers the whole Earth.
163420	168620	Actually, there is. There's the analysis by Remote Sensing Systems, which also gets its
168620	173960	data from the same satellite and covers the whole Earth. As we've seen, their results
173960	178340	don't agree with Spencer's. They agree much more closely with all the other temperature
178340	179340	measurements.
179340	185040	OK, then, maybe Spencer and his colleague, John Christie, have a much better track record
185040	190040	than anyone else in getting their temperature analysis right. And that's why we should
190040	194480	only trust their results and ignore all the others.
194480	200120	In fact, the opposite is true. In the 1990s, their temperature dataset was again out of
200120	204480	sync with all the others. Spencer claimed their satellite measurements – the line
204480	209760	at the bottom with the black dots – showed not a warming but a cooling trend of about
209760	214340	0.1 degrees C per decade in the tropics.
214340	218580	The graph they published showed the ground temperature data on the top line with a clear
218580	221100	warming trend.
221100	225920	When two researchers published evidence in 1997 that Spencer and Christie's observations
225920	231260	must be wrong, Spencer said there isn't a problem with the measurements that we can
231260	238780	find. And in a speech to the Competitive Enterprise Institute in 1997, he argued that his results
238780	245140	have an independent validation, which he said surface measurements don't.
245140	250900	As now, Spencer used his observations to argue that the warming predictions were wrong. He
250900	256640	said the models that originally predicted warming of around 0.3 degrees C per decade
256640	263340	but had now reduced that to 0.18 degrees. If that figure sounds familiar, we saw earlier
263340	268500	that that's not only the prediction of the models for actual CO2 concentration, it's
268500	273980	also the amount of warming measured by RSS and all the ground stations.
273980	279460	Spencer didn't disagree that CO2 is a greenhouse gas, but he argued that since the troposphere
279460	285060	wasn't warming as expected then nature must be getting rid of the excess heat, a temperature
285060	287860	stabilising mechanism.
287860	294980	It wasn't until 2005 that researchers at the other satellite analysis institute, RSS,
294980	299700	finally discovered the error in Spencer and Christie's calculations.
299700	305740	Put simply, the orbit of the temperature measuring satellite degrades over time. As a result,
305740	311620	daily temperatures get taken later and later in the day, which gives a false lower reading.
311620	316140	Spencer and Christie had adjusted their data to take account of this, but they'd made
316140	321900	a mathematical error. When the error was corrected, their temperature readings went from a flat
321900	331140	line of 0.087 to 0.19 degrees C per decade in line with everyone else, and in line with
331140	336820	the models, which Spencer himself had said predicted warming of around 0.18 degrees C
336820	338500	per decade.
338500	345740	Spencer later argued on his blog that this was only one error in 25 plus years. Actually,
345740	351700	there were others, but this was the most egregious, and it was a hugely important error because
351700	357300	the ambiguities set climate science back a decade, and it was one of the first claims
357300	362300	that launched the so-called sceptic movement on social media.
362300	366620	Now it was clear that the world was indeed warming, Spencer had to drop the argument
366620	371900	that weather systems were ridding the world of the excess heat caused by rising CO2 levels,
371900	376340	because clearly they weren't. But he still didn't want to drop his belief that the
376340	383380	earth must have some kind of natural self-regulating mechanism that would somehow stop the warming.
383380	388280	That idea doesn't work if carbon dioxide is responsible, because it would mean that temperatures
388280	393540	would keep going up as long as we keep adding CO2 to the atmosphere.
393540	398820	So he started looking around for some other reason for the warming. In 2008 he told a
398820	405160	Heritage Foundation conference there's probably a natural reason for it. In a blog contribution
405160	410900	that same year, he predicted that further research will reveal some other cause, maybe
410900	418040	the sun or a change in cloudiness, perhaps due to changes in the Pacific Decadal Oscillation.
418040	423080	But further research didn't show that. Solar physicists showed that solar activity was
423080	428760	falling so the sun couldn't be pushing global temperatures up, and further research showed
428760	434360	that for over 100 years there was no trend in the Pacific Decadal Oscillation compared
434360	440040	to the upward trend in global temperature. As for clouds, Spencer's argument was that
440040	446280	they're nature's sunshade, so if there's a decrease in cloud cover you get warming.
446280	451060	How could the experts have missed such a simple explanation, he asked?
451060	455280	Well they hadn't. Experts had done a huge amount of research into the cooling effect
455280	461120	of clouds. What they didn't miss was the fact that as well as being nature's sunshade, clouds
461120	467880	are also nature's blanket. They reflect shortwave energy from the sun back into space on top,
467880	474920	but also trap longwave radiation, heat energy, on Earth from below. What studies found was
474920	480560	that the warming effect is much more pronounced on high altitude clouds at night and at higher
480560	486640	latitudes and the cooling effect is greater with low altitude clouds during the day closer
486640	492860	to the tropics. Looking at both of these effects, and not just one, the net effect
492860	499320	of an increase in cloud cover is zero to slightly positive. So if anything, studies show a decrease
499320	504640	in cloud cover would cause a very slight cooling, not warming.
504640	509840	Spencer's belief that there's probably a natural reason for global warming and his feeling
509840	515320	that the Earth has a natural air conditioning process sounds like an article of faith, well
515320	521080	there's a good reason for that. Spencer has made no secret of his belief that God is directing
521080	528440	the climate. He's a member, and also on the advisory board, of an evangelical organisation
528440	534240	called the Cornwall Alliance that believes the Earth and its ecosystems, created by God's
534240	540040	intelligent design and infinite power and sustained by his faithful providence, are
540040	548820	robust, resilient, self-regulating and self-correcting. Earth's climate system is no exception.
548820	553320	Now there's nothing wrong with personal religious belief and millions of scientists around the
553320	559320	world are Christians, Jews, Hindus, Buddhists and Muslims who believe in all kinds of deities.
559320	564900	That's not the issue. The problem arises when a widely accepted scientific conclusion is
564900	570560	specifically precluded by that religious belief. When Spencer expounds his ideas of
570560	576780	some unknown self-regulating system keeping global warming in check in speeches, letters
576780	583200	to politicians, blogs and TV interviews, people assume he's talking as a scientist. They may
583200	589140	not be aware that what he's saying is indistinguishable from his religious doctrine that there must
589140	594700	be a self-regulating system because God would never let the climate warm beyond a comfortable
594700	600500	level. It's very clear to geologists, and this is my field, that the Earth does not
600500	606440	have a self-regulating system that keeps temperatures stable because they've gone much higher and
606440	612300	lower in the past. A million years ago there was a glaciation called the Calabrian with
612300	617140	ice sheets across most of the continents. Fifty million years ago there was what's called
617140	623940	a hot house or greenhouse period in the late Cretaceous. And before that a cool period.
623940	630500	And before that another greenhouse. And before that an ice age. And before that a greenhouse.
630500	636520	And before that an ice age. And before that, 500 million years ago, there was another greenhouse
636520	642780	with coral reefs near the North Pole. The range in temperatures between these extremes
642780	648680	is around 13 degrees centigrade. If you want to see why these changes have occurred, see
648680	654760	my video The History of the Earth in 33 Minutes. But even if you don't accept the scientific
654760	660160	explanation for these changes, the idea that there's a self-regulating mechanism or that
660160	666760	God or a force of nature would never let temperatures rise above 1 or 2 degrees centigrade is clearly
666760	672520	not supported by evidence from the past. Unless you believe the Earth's geological history
672520	680320	only goes back 6,500 years. But back to more recent history. No sooner
680320	687040	had Spencer and Christie's UAH satellite analysis been corrected than RSS had its own problems
687040	694440	with satellite data. Just like UAH in the 1990s, while every other data set showed warming,
694440	701120	RSS showed none, or even a slight cooling. Of course it was pretty obvious to climatologists
701120	706400	that there was something wrong with RSS's analysis. In his blog, Spencer wrote that
706400	712380	even his boss, John Christie, thought that the temperature recorded by RSS data was undergoing
712380	719400	spurious cooling. In other words, it's wrong. Most likely caused, again, by a decaying satellite
719400	723680	orbit. And Spencer added that those of you who really,
723680	728040	really need the global temperature record to show as little warming as possible might
728040	734920	want to consider jumping ship and switch from the UAH to the RSS data set. I'm sure
734920	741200	it was meant as a joke, but that's exactly what they did. Now that UAH had admitted the
741200	747880	world was indeed warming, and it was the RSS data that flatlined, suddenly it was the RSS
747880	752680	data set that was brought out every time the critics wanted to prove that global warming
752680	756560	had stopped. There's been no significant warming whatsoever.
756560	763120	The satellites show no global warming at all. Well, one analysis of the satellite data showed
763120	768800	no warming. The other satellite data analysis, by John Christie and Roy Spencer, did show
768800	774960	warming. Same with all the ground temperature data over the same period.
774960	779860	The same cherry-picked RSS graph was passed around blogs held up in congressional committee
779860	786480	hearings, featured in political reports, shown on TV, and wheeled out during political conferences,
786480	794020	until finally, in 2017, RSS found and published the source of its error.
794020	799540	As Christie and the other experts had predicted, when the faults were corrected, RSS data showed
799540	805540	a warming trend that matched the warming trend measured by everyone else. And it showed warming
805540	813700	of around, guess what, 0.18 degrees centigrade per decade for the last 35 years.
813700	819600	So why does satellite analysis, once lauded as the best data available, keep giving wrong
819600	825080	numbers? The problem is, there's just one satellite gathering data, and it isn't simply
825080	830120	pointing thermometers at the atmosphere and taking the temperature. The process is far
830120	836940	more complicated than that. It measures microwave radiance from oxygen atoms, and from that
836940	842860	researchers calculate the energy of the atoms. And from that energy, they calculate the temperature
842860	848960	of the atoms in that part of the troposphere using a model called the retrieval algorithm.
848960	854940	Then UAH subtracts what they estimate is the radiative effect from the ground. Finally,
854940	859440	they have to calculate the position of the satellite and adjust the data to take account
859440	863880	of its changing orbit. Spencer and Christie developed this model
863880	868500	back in the 1980s, and it was certainly a brilliant method of measuring the temperature
868500	874760	of the lower troposphere, in theory. But in practice, it's complicated and flawed,
874760	879100	and frequently underestimates global temperature trends.
879100	883420	If any conspiracy theorists think that this is just a plot by scientists to change data
883420	889120	they don't like, I should point out that Spencer and Christie themselves have published corrections
889120	899120	in 1992, 1994, 1997, 1998, 2003 and 2004. Each time they made a correction, it adjusted
899120	904680	the actual tropospheric temperature higher. They also accepted the major error found by
904680	914660	RSS in 2005, and they accepted the revision RSS made to its own faulty data in 2017.
914660	920160	So given the track record of satellite analysis, it's not a huge surprise that UAH temperature
920160	926300	measurements have again been drifting below all the others. That's why it's misleading
926300	937180	to report this as the actual temperature trend, and ignore all the others.
937180	941380	Apart from his belief that there should be a negative feedback system to counteract global
941380	946720	warming, Spencer's other argument is, or rather was, that the main positive feedback
946720	952920	anticipated by researchers wouldn't happen. That's an increase in water vapour.
952920	957980	The models predict that as more CO2 is added to the atmosphere, the amount of water vapour
957980	962920	in the atmosphere increases, because there's more evaporation and warmer air can hold more
962920	970220	water vapour. Since water vapour is a powerful greenhouse gas, that amplifies the warming.
970260	976040	Back in 1997, Spencer didn't disagree that water vapour is a powerful greenhouse gas,
976040	981240	and any increase could produce positive feedback. He just didn't think such an increase would
981240	986400	happen. But his prediction was wrong. Studies measuring
986400	992400	water vapour in the atmosphere over the next 20 years did find a change, an increase, just
992400	998160	as the models had predicted. This wasn't the only prediction Spencer's got wrong over
998160	1005480	the years. Also, in 1997, he expressed little confidence we'd even see 1 to 1.5 degrees
1005480	1011160	of warming by the end of this century. But we've already seen a 1 degree centigrade
1011160	1016660	rise in line with the models, and it's only 2022.
1016660	1021280	In 2012, he predicted this. We may see very little warming in the future.
1021280	1027020	That prediction was also wrong. Even Spencer's own data showed continued warming, just as
1027020	1033140	the models had predicted. And, as he admitted on his blog, all of the next six years were
1033140	1039300	warmer than 2012, and four of them were the warmest ever recorded.
1039300	1043500	As more and more of his predictions failed, and increasingly the warming we're seeing
1043500	1048100	matched the predictions of the models, it became harder for Spencer to claim there was
1048100	1053900	no warming, or that CO2 wasn't the cause. So his position has shifted over the last
1053900	1058460	25 years. Regarding tropospheric temperatures, he moved
1058460	1063420	from claiming there's a cooling trend, and it's unlikely temperatures will increase even
1063420	1068460	1 to 1.5 degrees centigrade by the end of this century, to an admission that it was
1068460	1074320	actually warming faster than that, and then to a claim that we'd see no more warming,
1074320	1078900	and then to an admission that there was more warming, and last year, an assertion that
1078900	1084860	warming will reach 1.5 to 2 degrees centigrade when CO2 concentration doubles, late in the
1084860	1089900	21st century. As for carbon dioxide, in the 1990s he argued
1089900	1095340	that it wasn't causing any warming because nature was getting rid of the excess heat.
1095340	1100100	In 2008, after his temperature measurements were shown to be wrong, he said the warming
1100100	1104740	was nothing to do with CO2. Four years later, he said this.
1104740	1108780	I think that most of the warming we've seen could well be natural.
1108780	1112100	Or to put it another way, I think some of that warmth is due to the
1112100	1116100	CO2 we're producing. And a few seconds later, it goes up to half.
1116100	1120420	I think about half of it's natural. A year later in his blog, he changed that
1120420	1127260	to, could be mostly human caused. So over the last 25 years, Spencer's temperature
1127260	1134180	predictions have slowly risen from negligible warming to almost match published estimates.
1134180	1138660	And his view about the role of carbon dioxide in this warming have moved up from none to
1138660	1144960	some to half to most. Despite doing numerous TV and vlog interviews,
1144960	1150500	no one seems to have noticed this subtle shift in position over the last 25 years or asked
1150500	1155380	Spencer about it. So this brings us back to where we started.
1155380	1160220	Far from failing, the climate models have proved to be remarkably accurate, while Spencer's
1160220	1166060	predictions pretty much all failed. Spencer has had to change his position several
1166060	1171720	times to keep up and has moved closer and closer to the published science.
1171720	1177860	So will he take that extra last step? My prediction is that he can't.
1177860	1183460	If he accepts that the increase in CO2 concentration is responsible for recent warming, that would
1183460	1188980	go against his fundamental religious belief that God is in charge of the climate.
1189020	1195140	And if he accepts that a doubling of CO2 concentration will lead to a rise of around 3 degrees centigrade
1195140	1200320	and keep rising as we burn more fossil fuels, then his doctrine that God has given the Earth
1200320	1206180	a self-regulating climate is dead. Abandoning a scientific conclusion in the
1206180	1212460	face of overwhelming contrary evidence is easy. Abandoning a fundamental religious belief
1212460	1214540	seems to be much, much harder.
