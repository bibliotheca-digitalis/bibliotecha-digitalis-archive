1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,540
There is a discrepancy between what the observations are showing, which shows about an average

2
00:00:06,540 --> 00:00:13,720
of 0.13 degrees C per decade warming, which is a very small number, compared to the climate

3
00:00:13,720 --> 00:00:17,580
models which are generally twice that at least.

4
00:00:17,580 --> 00:00:22,220
My thanks to those who cited this interview with Roy Spencer a few weeks back, claiming

5
00:00:22,220 --> 00:00:25,460
that global warming is far less than models predicted.

6
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:30,260
Actually, he's been saying the same thing for three decades, and in this video I'll

7
00:00:30,260 --> 00:00:34,940
look at that claim. So let's start with whether measurements show that the Earth's temperature

8
00:00:34,940 --> 00:00:43,080
is rising at 0.13 degrees C per decade. The answer is yes, if we only look at Roy Spencer

9
00:00:43,080 --> 00:00:49,340
and John Christie's analysis of the satellite data at the University of Alabama at Huntsville,

10
00:00:50,340 --> 00:00:55,980
If we look at all the other temperature monitoring bodies, they all show warming of about 0.18

11
00:00:55,980 --> 00:01:02,280
degrees C per decade. If you think satellites are more reliable than ground stations, well

12
00:01:02,280 --> 00:01:07,600
the analysis by the other satellite monitoring body, Remote Sensing Systems, that's the

13
00:01:07,600 --> 00:01:15,080
purple line at the top, also shows warming of about 0.18 degrees C per decade.

14
00:01:15,080 --> 00:01:20,880
Radiosonde balloons, which, like the satellites, are measuring temperatures in the lower troposphere,

15
00:01:20,880 --> 00:01:26,880
show even higher rates of warming. And an average of all the tropospheric measurements,

16
00:01:26,880 --> 00:01:34,020
including Spencer's UAH analysis, gives a warming trend of, again, 0.18 degrees C per

17
00:01:34,020 --> 00:01:40,580
decade. And the temperature trend conforms pretty well to the predictions of the models.

18
00:01:40,580 --> 00:01:45,500
Several independent studies have been done, and they've found a close match. The most

19
00:01:45,500 --> 00:01:52,220
recent study, a 2020 analysis in Geophysical Research Letters, found that 14 out of 17

20
00:01:52,220 --> 00:01:58,240
models closely matched observations for a given concentration of CO2. For a more detailed

21
00:01:58,240 --> 00:02:03,420
explanation of their results, please see the video description with a link to the study.

22
00:02:03,420 --> 00:02:08,940
All my sources are listed in the video description, along with links.

23
00:02:08,980 --> 00:02:14,180
A couple of the models reviewed are more than twice the temperature trend Spencer calculated,

24
00:02:14,180 --> 00:02:21,500
which would be over 0.26 degrees C per decade, but there's also one that's way under, so

25
00:02:21,500 --> 00:02:27,500
it's very easy to cherry pick. But the fact is that most of the models match the actual

26
00:02:27,500 --> 00:02:32,680
trend shown by every temperature dataset except Spencer's.

27
00:02:32,680 --> 00:02:36,740
So the next question is, how reliable is Spencer's analysis?

28
00:02:36,740 --> 00:02:40,380
The advantage to it is that it's from satellites and it covers the whole Earth. There's no

29
00:02:40,380 --> 00:02:43,420
other temperature dataset that covers the whole Earth.

30
00:02:43,420 --> 00:02:48,620
Actually, there is. There's the analysis by Remote Sensing Systems, which also gets its

31
00:02:48,620 --> 00:02:53,960
data from the same satellite and covers the whole Earth. As we've seen, their results

32
00:02:53,960 --> 00:02:58,340
don't agree with Spencer's. They agree much more closely with all the other temperature

33
00:02:58,340 --> 00:02:59,340
measurements.

34
00:02:59,340 --> 00:03:05,040
OK, then, maybe Spencer and his colleague, John Christie, have a much better track record

35
00:03:05,040 --> 00:03:10,040
than anyone else in getting their temperature analysis right. And that's why we should

36
00:03:10,040 --> 00:03:14,480
only trust their results and ignore all the others.

37
00:03:14,480 --> 00:03:20,120
In fact, the opposite is true. In the 1990s, their temperature dataset was again out of

38
00:03:20,120 --> 00:03:24,480
sync with all the others. Spencer claimed their satellite measurements – the line

39
00:03:24,480 --> 00:03:29,760
at the bottom with the black dots – showed not a warming but a cooling trend of about

40
00:03:29,760 --> 00:03:34,340
0.1 degrees C per decade in the tropics.

41
00:03:34,340 --> 00:03:38,580
The graph they published showed the ground temperature data on the top line with a clear

42
00:03:38,580 --> 00:03:41,100
warming trend.

43
00:03:41,100 --> 00:03:45,920
When two researchers published evidence in 1997 that Spencer and Christie's observations

44
00:03:45,920 --> 00:03:51,260
must be wrong, Spencer said there isn't a problem with the measurements that we can

45
00:03:51,260 --> 00:03:58,780
find. And in a speech to the Competitive Enterprise Institute in 1997, he argued that his results

46
00:03:58,780 --> 00:04:05,140
have an independent validation, which he said surface measurements don't.

47
00:04:05,140 --> 00:04:10,900
As now, Spencer used his observations to argue that the warming predictions were wrong. He

48
00:04:10,900 --> 00:04:16,640
said the models that originally predicted warming of around 0.3 degrees C per decade

49
00:04:16,640 --> 00:04:23,340
but had now reduced that to 0.18 degrees. If that figure sounds familiar, we saw earlier

50
00:04:23,340 --> 00:04:28,500
that that's not only the prediction of the models for actual CO2 concentration, it's

51
00:04:28,500 --> 00:04:33,980
also the amount of warming measured by RSS and all the ground stations.

52
00:04:33,980 --> 00:04:39,460
Spencer didn't disagree that CO2 is a greenhouse gas, but he argued that since the troposphere

53
00:04:39,460 --> 00:04:45,060
wasn't warming as expected then nature must be getting rid of the excess heat, a temperature

54
00:04:45,060 --> 00:04:47,860
stabilising mechanism.

55
00:04:47,860 --> 00:04:54,980
It wasn't until 2005 that researchers at the other satellite analysis institute, RSS,

56
00:04:54,980 --> 00:04:59,700
finally discovered the error in Spencer and Christie's calculations.

57
00:04:59,700 --> 00:05:05,740
Put simply, the orbit of the temperature measuring satellite degrades over time. As a result,

58
00:05:05,740 --> 00:05:11,620
daily temperatures get taken later and later in the day, which gives a false lower reading.

59
00:05:11,620 --> 00:05:16,140
Spencer and Christie had adjusted their data to take account of this, but they'd made

60
00:05:16,140 --> 00:05:21,900
a mathematical error. When the error was corrected, their temperature readings went from a flat

61
00:05:21,900 --> 00:05:31,140
line of 0.087 to 0.19 degrees C per decade in line with everyone else, and in line with

62
00:05:31,140 --> 00:05:36,820
the models, which Spencer himself had said predicted warming of around 0.18 degrees C

63
00:05:36,820 --> 00:05:38,500
per decade.

64
00:05:38,500 --> 00:05:45,740
Spencer later argued on his blog that this was only one error in 25 plus years. Actually,

65
00:05:45,740 --> 00:05:51,700
there were others, but this was the most egregious, and it was a hugely important error because

66
00:05:51,700 --> 00:05:57,300
the ambiguities set climate science back a decade, and it was one of the first claims

67
00:05:57,300 --> 00:06:02,300
that launched the so-called sceptic movement on social media.

68
00:06:02,300 --> 00:06:06,620
Now it was clear that the world was indeed warming, Spencer had to drop the argument

69
00:06:06,620 --> 00:06:11,900
that weather systems were ridding the world of the excess heat caused by rising CO2 levels,

70
00:06:11,900 --> 00:06:16,340
because clearly they weren't. But he still didn't want to drop his belief that the

71
00:06:16,340 --> 00:06:23,380
earth must have some kind of natural self-regulating mechanism that would somehow stop the warming.

72
00:06:23,380 --> 00:06:28,280
That idea doesn't work if carbon dioxide is responsible, because it would mean that temperatures

73
00:06:28,280 --> 00:06:33,540
would keep going up as long as we keep adding CO2 to the atmosphere.

74
00:06:33,540 --> 00:06:38,820
So he started looking around for some other reason for the warming. In 2008 he told a

75
00:06:38,820 --> 00:06:45,160
Heritage Foundation conference there's probably a natural reason for it. In a blog contribution

76
00:06:45,160 --> 00:06:50,900
that same year, he predicted that further research will reveal some other cause, maybe

77
00:06:50,900 --> 00:06:58,040
the sun or a change in cloudiness, perhaps due to changes in the Pacific Decadal Oscillation.

78
00:06:58,040 --> 00:07:03,080
But further research didn't show that. Solar physicists showed that solar activity was

79
00:07:03,080 --> 00:07:08,760
falling so the sun couldn't be pushing global temperatures up, and further research showed

80
00:07:08,760 --> 00:07:14,360
that for over 100 years there was no trend in the Pacific Decadal Oscillation compared

81
00:07:14,360 --> 00:07:20,040
to the upward trend in global temperature. As for clouds, Spencer's argument was that

82
00:07:20,040 --> 00:07:26,280
they're nature's sunshade, so if there's a decrease in cloud cover you get warming.

83
00:07:26,280 --> 00:07:31,060
How could the experts have missed such a simple explanation, he asked?

84
00:07:31,060 --> 00:07:35,280
Well they hadn't. Experts had done a huge amount of research into the cooling effect

85
00:07:35,280 --> 00:07:41,120
of clouds. What they didn't miss was the fact that as well as being nature's sunshade, clouds

86
00:07:41,120 --> 00:07:47,880
are also nature's blanket. They reflect shortwave energy from the sun back into space on top,

87
00:07:47,880 --> 00:07:54,920
but also trap longwave radiation, heat energy, on Earth from below. What studies found was

88
00:07:54,920 --> 00:08:00,560
that the warming effect is much more pronounced on high altitude clouds at night and at higher

89
00:08:00,560 --> 00:08:06,640
latitudes and the cooling effect is greater with low altitude clouds during the day closer

90
00:08:06,640 --> 00:08:12,860
to the tropics. Looking at both of these effects, and not just one, the net effect

91
00:08:12,860 --> 00:08:19,320
of an increase in cloud cover is zero to slightly positive. So if anything, studies show a decrease

92
00:08:19,320 --> 00:08:24,640
in cloud cover would cause a very slight cooling, not warming.

93
00:08:24,640 --> 00:08:29,840
Spencer's belief that there's probably a natural reason for global warming and his feeling

94
00:08:29,840 --> 00:08:35,320
that the Earth has a natural air conditioning process sounds like an article of faith, well

95
00:08:35,320 --> 00:08:41,080
there's a good reason for that. Spencer has made no secret of his belief that God is directing

96
00:08:41,080 --> 00:08:48,440
the climate. He's a member, and also on the advisory board, of an evangelical organisation

97
00:08:48,440 --> 00:08:54,240
called the Cornwall Alliance that believes the Earth and its ecosystems, created by God's

98
00:08:54,240 --> 00:09:00,040
intelligent design and infinite power and sustained by his faithful providence, are

99
00:09:00,040 --> 00:09:08,820
robust, resilient, self-regulating and self-correcting. Earth's climate system is no exception.

100
00:09:08,820 --> 00:09:13,320
Now there's nothing wrong with personal religious belief and millions of scientists around the

101
00:09:13,320 --> 00:09:19,320
world are Christians, Jews, Hindus, Buddhists and Muslims who believe in all kinds of deities.

102
00:09:19,320 --> 00:09:24,900
That's not the issue. The problem arises when a widely accepted scientific conclusion is

103
00:09:24,900 --> 00:09:30,560
specifically precluded by that religious belief. When Spencer expounds his ideas of

104
00:09:30,560 --> 00:09:36,780
some unknown self-regulating system keeping global warming in check in speeches, letters

105
00:09:36,780 --> 00:09:43,200
to politicians, blogs and TV interviews, people assume he's talking as a scientist. They may

106
00:09:43,200 --> 00:09:49,140
not be aware that what he's saying is indistinguishable from his religious doctrine that there must

107
00:09:49,140 --> 00:09:54,700
be a self-regulating system because God would never let the climate warm beyond a comfortable

108
00:09:54,700 --> 00:10:00,500
level. It's very clear to geologists, and this is my field, that the Earth does not

109
00:10:00,500 --> 00:10:06,440
have a self-regulating system that keeps temperatures stable because they've gone much higher and

110
00:10:06,440 --> 00:10:12,300
lower in the past. A million years ago there was a glaciation called the Calabrian with

111
00:10:12,300 --> 00:10:17,140
ice sheets across most of the continents. Fifty million years ago there was what's called

112
00:10:17,140 --> 00:10:23,940
a hot house or greenhouse period in the late Cretaceous. And before that a cool period.

113
00:10:23,940 --> 00:10:30,500
And before that another greenhouse. And before that an ice age. And before that a greenhouse.

114
00:10:30,500 --> 00:10:36,520
And before that an ice age. And before that, 500 million years ago, there was another greenhouse

115
00:10:36,520 --> 00:10:42,780
with coral reefs near the North Pole. The range in temperatures between these extremes

116
00:10:42,780 --> 00:10:48,680
is around 13 degrees centigrade. If you want to see why these changes have occurred, see

117
00:10:48,680 --> 00:10:54,760
my video The History of the Earth in 33 Minutes. But even if you don't accept the scientific

118
00:10:54,760 --> 00:11:00,160
explanation for these changes, the idea that there's a self-regulating mechanism or that

119
00:11:00,160 --> 00:11:06,760
God or a force of nature would never let temperatures rise above 1 or 2 degrees centigrade is clearly

120
00:11:06,760 --> 00:11:12,520
not supported by evidence from the past. Unless you believe the Earth's geological history

121
00:11:12,520 --> 00:11:20,320
only goes back 6,500 years. But back to more recent history. No sooner

122
00:11:20,320 --> 00:11:27,040
had Spencer and Christie's UAH satellite analysis been corrected than RSS had its own problems

123
00:11:27,040 --> 00:11:34,440
with satellite data. Just like UAH in the 1990s, while every other data set showed warming,

124
00:11:34,440 --> 00:11:41,120
RSS showed none, or even a slight cooling. Of course it was pretty obvious to climatologists

125
00:11:41,120 --> 00:11:46,400
that there was something wrong with RSS's analysis. In his blog, Spencer wrote that

126
00:11:46,400 --> 00:11:52,380
even his boss, John Christie, thought that the temperature recorded by RSS data was undergoing

127
00:11:52,380 --> 00:11:59,400
spurious cooling. In other words, it's wrong. Most likely caused, again, by a decaying satellite

128
00:11:59,400 --> 00:12:03,680
orbit. And Spencer added that those of you who really,

129
00:12:03,680 --> 00:12:08,040
really need the global temperature record to show as little warming as possible might

130
00:12:08,040 --> 00:12:14,920
want to consider jumping ship and switch from the UAH to the RSS data set. I'm sure

131
00:12:14,920 --> 00:12:21,200
it was meant as a joke, but that's exactly what they did. Now that UAH had admitted the

132
00:12:21,200 --> 00:12:27,880
world was indeed warming, and it was the RSS data that flatlined, suddenly it was the RSS

133
00:12:27,880 --> 00:12:32,680
data set that was brought out every time the critics wanted to prove that global warming

134
00:12:32,680 --> 00:12:36,560
had stopped. There's been no significant warming whatsoever.

135
00:12:36,560 --> 00:12:43,120
The satellites show no global warming at all. Well, one analysis of the satellite data showed

136
00:12:43,120 --> 00:12:48,800
no warming. The other satellite data analysis, by John Christie and Roy Spencer, did show

137
00:12:48,800 --> 00:12:54,960
warming. Same with all the ground temperature data over the same period.

138
00:12:54,960 --> 00:12:59,860
The same cherry-picked RSS graph was passed around blogs held up in congressional committee

139
00:12:59,860 --> 00:13:06,480
hearings, featured in political reports, shown on TV, and wheeled out during political conferences,

140
00:13:06,480 --> 00:13:14,020
until finally, in 2017, RSS found and published the source of its error.

141
00:13:14,020 --> 00:13:19,540
As Christie and the other experts had predicted, when the faults were corrected, RSS data showed

142
00:13:19,540 --> 00:13:25,540
a warming trend that matched the warming trend measured by everyone else. And it showed warming

143
00:13:25,540 --> 00:13:33,700
of around, guess what, 0.18 degrees centigrade per decade for the last 35 years.

144
00:13:33,700 --> 00:13:39,600
So why does satellite analysis, once lauded as the best data available, keep giving wrong

145
00:13:39,600 --> 00:13:45,080
numbers? The problem is, there's just one satellite gathering data, and it isn't simply

146
00:13:45,080 --> 00:13:50,120
pointing thermometers at the atmosphere and taking the temperature. The process is far

147
00:13:50,120 --> 00:13:56,940
more complicated than that. It measures microwave radiance from oxygen atoms, and from that

148
00:13:56,940 --> 00:14:02,860
researchers calculate the energy of the atoms. And from that energy, they calculate the temperature

149
00:14:02,860 --> 00:14:08,960
of the atoms in that part of the troposphere using a model called the retrieval algorithm.

150
00:14:08,960 --> 00:14:14,940
Then UAH subtracts what they estimate is the radiative effect from the ground. Finally,

151
00:14:14,940 --> 00:14:19,440
they have to calculate the position of the satellite and adjust the data to take account

152
00:14:19,440 --> 00:14:23,880
of its changing orbit. Spencer and Christie developed this model

153
00:14:23,880 --> 00:14:28,500
back in the 1980s, and it was certainly a brilliant method of measuring the temperature

154
00:14:28,500 --> 00:14:34,760
of the lower troposphere, in theory. But in practice, it's complicated and flawed,

155
00:14:34,760 --> 00:14:39,100
and frequently underestimates global temperature trends.

156
00:14:39,100 --> 00:14:43,420
If any conspiracy theorists think that this is just a plot by scientists to change data

157
00:14:43,420 --> 00:14:49,120
they don't like, I should point out that Spencer and Christie themselves have published corrections

158
00:14:49,120 --> 00:14:59,120
in 1992, 1994, 1997, 1998, 2003 and 2004. Each time they made a correction, it adjusted

159
00:14:59,120 --> 00:15:04,680
the actual tropospheric temperature higher. They also accepted the major error found by

160
00:15:04,680 --> 00:15:14,660
RSS in 2005, and they accepted the revision RSS made to its own faulty data in 2017.

161
00:15:14,660 --> 00:15:20,160
So given the track record of satellite analysis, it's not a huge surprise that UAH temperature

162
00:15:20,160 --> 00:15:26,300
measurements have again been drifting below all the others. That's why it's misleading

163
00:15:26,300 --> 00:15:37,180
to report this as the actual temperature trend, and ignore all the others.

164
00:15:37,180 --> 00:15:41,380
Apart from his belief that there should be a negative feedback system to counteract global

165
00:15:41,380 --> 00:15:46,720
warming, Spencer's other argument is, or rather was, that the main positive feedback

166
00:15:46,720 --> 00:15:52,920
anticipated by researchers wouldn't happen. That's an increase in water vapour.

167
00:15:52,920 --> 00:15:57,980
The models predict that as more CO2 is added to the atmosphere, the amount of water vapour

168
00:15:57,980 --> 00:16:02,920
in the atmosphere increases, because there's more evaporation and warmer air can hold more

169
00:16:02,920 --> 00:16:10,220
water vapour. Since water vapour is a powerful greenhouse gas, that amplifies the warming.

170
00:16:10,260 --> 00:16:16,040
Back in 1997, Spencer didn't disagree that water vapour is a powerful greenhouse gas,

171
00:16:16,040 --> 00:16:21,240
and any increase could produce positive feedback. He just didn't think such an increase would

172
00:16:21,240 --> 00:16:26,400
happen. But his prediction was wrong. Studies measuring

173
00:16:26,400 --> 00:16:32,400
water vapour in the atmosphere over the next 20 years did find a change, an increase, just

174
00:16:32,400 --> 00:16:38,160
as the models had predicted. This wasn't the only prediction Spencer's got wrong over

175
00:16:38,160 --> 00:16:45,480
the years. Also, in 1997, he expressed little confidence we'd even see 1 to 1.5 degrees

176
00:16:45,480 --> 00:16:51,160
of warming by the end of this century. But we've already seen a 1 degree centigrade

177
00:16:51,160 --> 00:16:56,660
rise in line with the models, and it's only 2022.

178
00:16:56,660 --> 00:17:01,280
In 2012, he predicted this. We may see very little warming in the future.

179
00:17:01,280 --> 00:17:07,020
That prediction was also wrong. Even Spencer's own data showed continued warming, just as

180
00:17:07,020 --> 00:17:13,140
the models had predicted. And, as he admitted on his blog, all of the next six years were

181
00:17:13,140 --> 00:17:19,300
warmer than 2012, and four of them were the warmest ever recorded.

182
00:17:19,300 --> 00:17:23,500
As more and more of his predictions failed, and increasingly the warming we're seeing

183
00:17:23,500 --> 00:17:28,100
matched the predictions of the models, it became harder for Spencer to claim there was

184
00:17:28,100 --> 00:17:33,900
no warming, or that CO2 wasn't the cause. So his position has shifted over the last

185
00:17:33,900 --> 00:17:38,460
25 years. Regarding tropospheric temperatures, he moved

186
00:17:38,460 --> 00:17:43,420
from claiming there's a cooling trend, and it's unlikely temperatures will increase even

187
00:17:43,420 --> 00:17:48,460
1 to 1.5 degrees centigrade by the end of this century, to an admission that it was

188
00:17:48,460 --> 00:17:54,320
actually warming faster than that, and then to a claim that we'd see no more warming,

189
00:17:54,320 --> 00:17:58,900
and then to an admission that there was more warming, and last year, an assertion that

190
00:17:58,900 --> 00:18:04,860
warming will reach 1.5 to 2 degrees centigrade when CO2 concentration doubles, late in the

191
00:18:04,860 --> 00:18:09,900
21st century. As for carbon dioxide, in the 1990s he argued

192
00:18:09,900 --> 00:18:15,340
that it wasn't causing any warming because nature was getting rid of the excess heat.

193
00:18:15,340 --> 00:18:20,100
In 2008, after his temperature measurements were shown to be wrong, he said the warming

194
00:18:20,100 --> 00:18:24,740
was nothing to do with CO2. Four years later, he said this.

195
00:18:24,740 --> 00:18:28,780
I think that most of the warming we've seen could well be natural.

196
00:18:28,780 --> 00:18:32,100
Or to put it another way, I think some of that warmth is due to the

197
00:18:32,100 --> 00:18:36,100
CO2 we're producing. And a few seconds later, it goes up to half.

198
00:18:36,100 --> 00:18:40,420
I think about half of it's natural. A year later in his blog, he changed that

199
00:18:40,420 --> 00:18:47,260
to, could be mostly human caused. So over the last 25 years, Spencer's temperature

200
00:18:47,260 --> 00:18:54,180
predictions have slowly risen from negligible warming to almost match published estimates.

201
00:18:54,180 --> 00:18:58,660
And his view about the role of carbon dioxide in this warming have moved up from none to

202
00:18:58,660 --> 00:19:04,960
some to half to most. Despite doing numerous TV and vlog interviews,

203
00:19:04,960 --> 00:19:10,500
no one seems to have noticed this subtle shift in position over the last 25 years or asked

204
00:19:10,500 --> 00:19:15,380
Spencer about it. So this brings us back to where we started.

205
00:19:15,380 --> 00:19:20,220
Far from failing, the climate models have proved to be remarkably accurate, while Spencer's

206
00:19:20,220 --> 00:19:26,060
predictions pretty much all failed. Spencer has had to change his position several

207
00:19:26,060 --> 00:19:31,720
times to keep up and has moved closer and closer to the published science.

208
00:19:31,720 --> 00:19:37,860
So will he take that extra last step? My prediction is that he can't.

209
00:19:37,860 --> 00:19:43,460
If he accepts that the increase in CO2 concentration is responsible for recent warming, that would

210
00:19:43,460 --> 00:19:48,980
go against his fundamental religious belief that God is in charge of the climate.

211
00:19:49,020 --> 00:19:55,140
And if he accepts that a doubling of CO2 concentration will lead to a rise of around 3 degrees centigrade

212
00:19:55,140 --> 00:20:00,320
and keep rising as we burn more fossil fuels, then his doctrine that God has given the Earth

213
00:20:00,320 --> 00:20:06,180
a self-regulating climate is dead. Abandoning a scientific conclusion in the

214
00:20:06,180 --> 00:20:12,460
face of overwhelming contrary evidence is easy. Abandoning a fundamental religious belief

215
00:20:12,460 --> 00:20:14,540
seems to be much, much harder.
