00:00.000 --> 00:06.540
There is a discrepancy between what the observations are showing, which shows about an average

00:06.540 --> 00:13.720
of 0.13 degrees C per decade warming, which is a very small number, compared to the climate

00:13.720 --> 00:17.580
models which are generally twice that at least.

00:17.580 --> 00:22.220
My thanks to those who cited this interview with Roy Spencer a few weeks back, claiming

00:22.220 --> 00:25.460
that global warming is far less than models predicted.

00:26.000 --> 00:30.260
Actually, he's been saying the same thing for three decades, and in this video I'll

00:30.260 --> 00:34.940
look at that claim. So let's start with whether measurements show that the Earth's temperature

00:34.940 --> 00:43.080
is rising at 0.13 degrees C per decade. The answer is yes, if we only look at Roy Spencer

00:43.080 --> 00:49.340
and John Christie's analysis of the satellite data at the University of Alabama at Huntsville,

00:50.340 --> 00:55.980
If we look at all the other temperature monitoring bodies, they all show warming of about 0.18

00:55.980 --> 01:02.280
degrees C per decade. If you think satellites are more reliable than ground stations, well

01:02.280 --> 01:07.600
the analysis by the other satellite monitoring body, Remote Sensing Systems, that's the

01:07.600 --> 01:15.080
purple line at the top, also shows warming of about 0.18 degrees C per decade.

01:15.080 --> 01:20.880
Radiosonde balloons, which, like the satellites, are measuring temperatures in the lower troposphere,

01:20.880 --> 01:26.880
show even higher rates of warming. And an average of all the tropospheric measurements,

01:26.880 --> 01:34.020
including Spencer's UAH analysis, gives a warming trend of, again, 0.18 degrees C per

01:34.020 --> 01:40.580
decade. And the temperature trend conforms pretty well to the predictions of the models.

01:40.580 --> 01:45.500
Several independent studies have been done, and they've found a close match. The most

01:45.500 --> 01:52.220
recent study, a 2020 analysis in Geophysical Research Letters, found that 14 out of 17

01:52.220 --> 01:58.240
models closely matched observations for a given concentration of CO2. For a more detailed

01:58.240 --> 02:03.420
explanation of their results, please see the video description with a link to the study.

02:03.420 --> 02:08.940
All my sources are listed in the video description, along with links.

02:08.980 --> 02:14.180
A couple of the models reviewed are more than twice the temperature trend Spencer calculated,

02:14.180 --> 02:21.500
which would be over 0.26 degrees C per decade, but there's also one that's way under, so

02:21.500 --> 02:27.500
it's very easy to cherry pick. But the fact is that most of the models match the actual

02:27.500 --> 02:32.680
trend shown by every temperature dataset except Spencer's.

02:32.680 --> 02:36.740
So the next question is, how reliable is Spencer's analysis?

02:36.740 --> 02:40.380
The advantage to it is that it's from satellites and it covers the whole Earth. There's no

02:40.380 --> 02:43.420
other temperature dataset that covers the whole Earth.

02:43.420 --> 02:48.620
Actually, there is. There's the analysis by Remote Sensing Systems, which also gets its

02:48.620 --> 02:53.960
data from the same satellite and covers the whole Earth. As we've seen, their results

02:53.960 --> 02:58.340
don't agree with Spencer's. They agree much more closely with all the other temperature

02:58.340 --> 02:59.340
measurements.

02:59.340 --> 03:05.040
OK, then, maybe Spencer and his colleague, John Christie, have a much better track record

03:05.040 --> 03:10.040
than anyone else in getting their temperature analysis right. And that's why we should

03:10.040 --> 03:14.480
only trust their results and ignore all the others.

03:14.480 --> 03:20.120
In fact, the opposite is true. In the 1990s, their temperature dataset was again out of

03:20.120 --> 03:24.480
sync with all the others. Spencer claimed their satellite measurements – the line

03:24.480 --> 03:29.760
at the bottom with the black dots – showed not a warming but a cooling trend of about

03:29.760 --> 03:34.340
0.1 degrees C per decade in the tropics.

03:34.340 --> 03:38.580
The graph they published showed the ground temperature data on the top line with a clear

03:38.580 --> 03:41.100
warming trend.

03:41.100 --> 03:45.920
When two researchers published evidence in 1997 that Spencer and Christie's observations

03:45.920 --> 03:51.260
must be wrong, Spencer said there isn't a problem with the measurements that we can

03:51.260 --> 03:58.780
find. And in a speech to the Competitive Enterprise Institute in 1997, he argued that his results

03:58.780 --> 04:05.140
have an independent validation, which he said surface measurements don't.

04:05.140 --> 04:10.900
As now, Spencer used his observations to argue that the warming predictions were wrong. He

04:10.900 --> 04:16.640
said the models that originally predicted warming of around 0.3 degrees C per decade

04:16.640 --> 04:23.340
but had now reduced that to 0.18 degrees. If that figure sounds familiar, we saw earlier

04:23.340 --> 04:28.500
that that's not only the prediction of the models for actual CO2 concentration, it's

04:28.500 --> 04:33.980
also the amount of warming measured by RSS and all the ground stations.

04:33.980 --> 04:39.460
Spencer didn't disagree that CO2 is a greenhouse gas, but he argued that since the troposphere

04:39.460 --> 04:45.060
wasn't warming as expected then nature must be getting rid of the excess heat, a temperature

04:45.060 --> 04:47.860
stabilising mechanism.

04:47.860 --> 04:54.980
It wasn't until 2005 that researchers at the other satellite analysis institute, RSS,

04:54.980 --> 04:59.700
finally discovered the error in Spencer and Christie's calculations.

04:59.700 --> 05:05.740
Put simply, the orbit of the temperature measuring satellite degrades over time. As a result,

05:05.740 --> 05:11.620
daily temperatures get taken later and later in the day, which gives a false lower reading.

05:11.620 --> 05:16.140
Spencer and Christie had adjusted their data to take account of this, but they'd made

05:16.140 --> 05:21.900
a mathematical error. When the error was corrected, their temperature readings went from a flat

05:21.900 --> 05:31.140
line of 0.087 to 0.19 degrees C per decade in line with everyone else, and in line with

05:31.140 --> 05:36.820
the models, which Spencer himself had said predicted warming of around 0.18 degrees C

05:36.820 --> 05:38.500
per decade.

05:38.500 --> 05:45.740
Spencer later argued on his blog that this was only one error in 25 plus years. Actually,

05:45.740 --> 05:51.700
there were others, but this was the most egregious, and it was a hugely important error because

05:51.700 --> 05:57.300
the ambiguities set climate science back a decade, and it was one of the first claims

05:57.300 --> 06:02.300
that launched the so-called sceptic movement on social media.

06:02.300 --> 06:06.620
Now it was clear that the world was indeed warming, Spencer had to drop the argument

06:06.620 --> 06:11.900
that weather systems were ridding the world of the excess heat caused by rising CO2 levels,

06:11.900 --> 06:16.340
because clearly they weren't. But he still didn't want to drop his belief that the

06:16.340 --> 06:23.380
earth must have some kind of natural self-regulating mechanism that would somehow stop the warming.

06:23.380 --> 06:28.280
That idea doesn't work if carbon dioxide is responsible, because it would mean that temperatures

06:28.280 --> 06:33.540
would keep going up as long as we keep adding CO2 to the atmosphere.

06:33.540 --> 06:38.820
So he started looking around for some other reason for the warming. In 2008 he told a

06:38.820 --> 06:45.160
Heritage Foundation conference there's probably a natural reason for it. In a blog contribution

06:45.160 --> 06:50.900
that same year, he predicted that further research will reveal some other cause, maybe

06:50.900 --> 06:58.040
the sun or a change in cloudiness, perhaps due to changes in the Pacific Decadal Oscillation.

06:58.040 --> 07:03.080
But further research didn't show that. Solar physicists showed that solar activity was

07:03.080 --> 07:08.760
falling so the sun couldn't be pushing global temperatures up, and further research showed

07:08.760 --> 07:14.360
that for over 100 years there was no trend in the Pacific Decadal Oscillation compared

07:14.360 --> 07:20.040
to the upward trend in global temperature. As for clouds, Spencer's argument was that

07:20.040 --> 07:26.280
they're nature's sunshade, so if there's a decrease in cloud cover you get warming.

07:26.280 --> 07:31.060
How could the experts have missed such a simple explanation, he asked?

07:31.060 --> 07:35.280
Well they hadn't. Experts had done a huge amount of research into the cooling effect

07:35.280 --> 07:41.120
of clouds. What they didn't miss was the fact that as well as being nature's sunshade, clouds

07:41.120 --> 07:47.880
are also nature's blanket. They reflect shortwave energy from the sun back into space on top,

07:47.880 --> 07:54.920
but also trap longwave radiation, heat energy, on Earth from below. What studies found was

07:54.920 --> 08:00.560
that the warming effect is much more pronounced on high altitude clouds at night and at higher

08:00.560 --> 08:06.640
latitudes and the cooling effect is greater with low altitude clouds during the day closer

08:06.640 --> 08:12.860
to the tropics. Looking at both of these effects, and not just one, the net effect

08:12.860 --> 08:19.320
of an increase in cloud cover is zero to slightly positive. So if anything, studies show a decrease

08:19.320 --> 08:24.640
in cloud cover would cause a very slight cooling, not warming.

08:24.640 --> 08:29.840
Spencer's belief that there's probably a natural reason for global warming and his feeling

08:29.840 --> 08:35.320
that the Earth has a natural air conditioning process sounds like an article of faith, well

08:35.320 --> 08:41.080
there's a good reason for that. Spencer has made no secret of his belief that God is directing

08:41.080 --> 08:48.440
the climate. He's a member, and also on the advisory board, of an evangelical organisation

08:48.440 --> 08:54.240
called the Cornwall Alliance that believes the Earth and its ecosystems, created by God's

08:54.240 --> 09:00.040
intelligent design and infinite power and sustained by his faithful providence, are

09:00.040 --> 09:08.820
robust, resilient, self-regulating and self-correcting. Earth's climate system is no exception.

09:08.820 --> 09:13.320
Now there's nothing wrong with personal religious belief and millions of scientists around the

09:13.320 --> 09:19.320
world are Christians, Jews, Hindus, Buddhists and Muslims who believe in all kinds of deities.

09:19.320 --> 09:24.900
That's not the issue. The problem arises when a widely accepted scientific conclusion is

09:24.900 --> 09:30.560
specifically precluded by that religious belief. When Spencer expounds his ideas of

09:30.560 --> 09:36.780
some unknown self-regulating system keeping global warming in check in speeches, letters

09:36.780 --> 09:43.200
to politicians, blogs and TV interviews, people assume he's talking as a scientist. They may

09:43.200 --> 09:49.140
not be aware that what he's saying is indistinguishable from his religious doctrine that there must

09:49.140 --> 09:54.700
be a self-regulating system because God would never let the climate warm beyond a comfortable

09:54.700 --> 10:00.500
level. It's very clear to geologists, and this is my field, that the Earth does not

10:00.500 --> 10:06.440
have a self-regulating system that keeps temperatures stable because they've gone much higher and

10:06.440 --> 10:12.300
lower in the past. A million years ago there was a glaciation called the Calabrian with

10:12.300 --> 10:17.140
ice sheets across most of the continents. Fifty million years ago there was what's called

10:17.140 --> 10:23.940
a hot house or greenhouse period in the late Cretaceous. And before that a cool period.

10:23.940 --> 10:30.500
And before that another greenhouse. And before that an ice age. And before that a greenhouse.

10:30.500 --> 10:36.520
And before that an ice age. And before that, 500 million years ago, there was another greenhouse

10:36.520 --> 10:42.780
with coral reefs near the North Pole. The range in temperatures between these extremes

10:42.780 --> 10:48.680
is around 13 degrees centigrade. If you want to see why these changes have occurred, see

10:48.680 --> 10:54.760
my video The History of the Earth in 33 Minutes. But even if you don't accept the scientific

10:54.760 --> 11:00.160
explanation for these changes, the idea that there's a self-regulating mechanism or that

11:00.160 --> 11:06.760
God or a force of nature would never let temperatures rise above 1 or 2 degrees centigrade is clearly

11:06.760 --> 11:12.520
not supported by evidence from the past. Unless you believe the Earth's geological history

11:12.520 --> 11:20.320
only goes back 6,500 years. But back to more recent history. No sooner

11:20.320 --> 11:27.040
had Spencer and Christie's UAH satellite analysis been corrected than RSS had its own problems

11:27.040 --> 11:34.440
with satellite data. Just like UAH in the 1990s, while every other data set showed warming,

11:34.440 --> 11:41.120
RSS showed none, or even a slight cooling. Of course it was pretty obvious to climatologists

11:41.120 --> 11:46.400
that there was something wrong with RSS's analysis. In his blog, Spencer wrote that

11:46.400 --> 11:52.380
even his boss, John Christie, thought that the temperature recorded by RSS data was undergoing

11:52.380 --> 11:59.400
spurious cooling. In other words, it's wrong. Most likely caused, again, by a decaying satellite

11:59.400 --> 12:03.680
orbit. And Spencer added that those of you who really,

12:03.680 --> 12:08.040
really need the global temperature record to show as little warming as possible might

12:08.040 --> 12:14.920
want to consider jumping ship and switch from the UAH to the RSS data set. I'm sure

12:14.920 --> 12:21.200
it was meant as a joke, but that's exactly what they did. Now that UAH had admitted the

12:21.200 --> 12:27.880
world was indeed warming, and it was the RSS data that flatlined, suddenly it was the RSS

12:27.880 --> 12:32.680
data set that was brought out every time the critics wanted to prove that global warming

12:32.680 --> 12:36.560
had stopped. There's been no significant warming whatsoever.

12:36.560 --> 12:43.120
The satellites show no global warming at all. Well, one analysis of the satellite data showed

12:43.120 --> 12:48.800
no warming. The other satellite data analysis, by John Christie and Roy Spencer, did show

12:48.800 --> 12:54.960
warming. Same with all the ground temperature data over the same period.

12:54.960 --> 12:59.860
The same cherry-picked RSS graph was passed around blogs held up in congressional committee

12:59.860 --> 13:06.480
hearings, featured in political reports, shown on TV, and wheeled out during political conferences,

13:06.480 --> 13:14.020
until finally, in 2017, RSS found and published the source of its error.

13:14.020 --> 13:19.540
As Christie and the other experts had predicted, when the faults were corrected, RSS data showed

13:19.540 --> 13:25.540
a warming trend that matched the warming trend measured by everyone else. And it showed warming

13:25.540 --> 13:33.700
of around, guess what, 0.18 degrees centigrade per decade for the last 35 years.

13:33.700 --> 13:39.600
So why does satellite analysis, once lauded as the best data available, keep giving wrong

13:39.600 --> 13:45.080
numbers? The problem is, there's just one satellite gathering data, and it isn't simply

13:45.080 --> 13:50.120
pointing thermometers at the atmosphere and taking the temperature. The process is far

13:50.120 --> 13:56.940
more complicated than that. It measures microwave radiance from oxygen atoms, and from that

13:56.940 --> 14:02.860
researchers calculate the energy of the atoms. And from that energy, they calculate the temperature

14:02.860 --> 14:08.960
of the atoms in that part of the troposphere using a model called the retrieval algorithm.

14:08.960 --> 14:14.940
Then UAH subtracts what they estimate is the radiative effect from the ground. Finally,

14:14.940 --> 14:19.440
they have to calculate the position of the satellite and adjust the data to take account

14:19.440 --> 14:23.880
of its changing orbit. Spencer and Christie developed this model

14:23.880 --> 14:28.500
back in the 1980s, and it was certainly a brilliant method of measuring the temperature

14:28.500 --> 14:34.760
of the lower troposphere, in theory. But in practice, it's complicated and flawed,

14:34.760 --> 14:39.100
and frequently underestimates global temperature trends.

14:39.100 --> 14:43.420
If any conspiracy theorists think that this is just a plot by scientists to change data

14:43.420 --> 14:49.120
they don't like, I should point out that Spencer and Christie themselves have published corrections

14:49.120 --> 14:59.120
in 1992, 1994, 1997, 1998, 2003 and 2004. Each time they made a correction, it adjusted

14:59.120 --> 15:04.680
the actual tropospheric temperature higher. They also accepted the major error found by

15:04.680 --> 15:14.660
RSS in 2005, and they accepted the revision RSS made to its own faulty data in 2017.

15:14.660 --> 15:20.160
So given the track record of satellite analysis, it's not a huge surprise that UAH temperature

15:20.160 --> 15:26.300
measurements have again been drifting below all the others. That's why it's misleading

15:26.300 --> 15:37.180
to report this as the actual temperature trend, and ignore all the others.

15:37.180 --> 15:41.380
Apart from his belief that there should be a negative feedback system to counteract global

15:41.380 --> 15:46.720
warming, Spencer's other argument is, or rather was, that the main positive feedback

15:46.720 --> 15:52.920
anticipated by researchers wouldn't happen. That's an increase in water vapour.

15:52.920 --> 15:57.980
The models predict that as more CO2 is added to the atmosphere, the amount of water vapour

15:57.980 --> 16:02.920
in the atmosphere increases, because there's more evaporation and warmer air can hold more

16:02.920 --> 16:10.220
water vapour. Since water vapour is a powerful greenhouse gas, that amplifies the warming.

16:10.260 --> 16:16.040
Back in 1997, Spencer didn't disagree that water vapour is a powerful greenhouse gas,

16:16.040 --> 16:21.240
and any increase could produce positive feedback. He just didn't think such an increase would

16:21.240 --> 16:26.400
happen. But his prediction was wrong. Studies measuring

16:26.400 --> 16:32.400
water vapour in the atmosphere over the next 20 years did find a change, an increase, just

16:32.400 --> 16:38.160
as the models had predicted. This wasn't the only prediction Spencer's got wrong over

16:38.160 --> 16:45.480
the years. Also, in 1997, he expressed little confidence we'd even see 1 to 1.5 degrees

16:45.480 --> 16:51.160
of warming by the end of this century. But we've already seen a 1 degree centigrade

16:51.160 --> 16:56.660
rise in line with the models, and it's only 2022.

16:56.660 --> 17:01.280
In 2012, he predicted this. We may see very little warming in the future.

17:01.280 --> 17:07.020
That prediction was also wrong. Even Spencer's own data showed continued warming, just as

17:07.020 --> 17:13.140
the models had predicted. And, as he admitted on his blog, all of the next six years were

17:13.140 --> 17:19.300
warmer than 2012, and four of them were the warmest ever recorded.

17:19.300 --> 17:23.500
As more and more of his predictions failed, and increasingly the warming we're seeing

17:23.500 --> 17:28.100
matched the predictions of the models, it became harder for Spencer to claim there was

17:28.100 --> 17:33.900
no warming, or that CO2 wasn't the cause. So his position has shifted over the last

17:33.900 --> 17:38.460
25 years. Regarding tropospheric temperatures, he moved

17:38.460 --> 17:43.420
from claiming there's a cooling trend, and it's unlikely temperatures will increase even

17:43.420 --> 17:48.460
1 to 1.5 degrees centigrade by the end of this century, to an admission that it was

17:48.460 --> 17:54.320
actually warming faster than that, and then to a claim that we'd see no more warming,

17:54.320 --> 17:58.900
and then to an admission that there was more warming, and last year, an assertion that

17:58.900 --> 18:04.860
warming will reach 1.5 to 2 degrees centigrade when CO2 concentration doubles, late in the

18:04.860 --> 18:09.900
21st century. As for carbon dioxide, in the 1990s he argued

18:09.900 --> 18:15.340
that it wasn't causing any warming because nature was getting rid of the excess heat.

18:15.340 --> 18:20.100
In 2008, after his temperature measurements were shown to be wrong, he said the warming

18:20.100 --> 18:24.740
was nothing to do with CO2. Four years later, he said this.

18:24.740 --> 18:28.780
I think that most of the warming we've seen could well be natural.

18:28.780 --> 18:32.100
Or to put it another way, I think some of that warmth is due to the

18:32.100 --> 18:36.100
CO2 we're producing. And a few seconds later, it goes up to half.

18:36.100 --> 18:40.420
I think about half of it's natural. A year later in his blog, he changed that

18:40.420 --> 18:47.260
to, could be mostly human caused. So over the last 25 years, Spencer's temperature

18:47.260 --> 18:54.180
predictions have slowly risen from negligible warming to almost match published estimates.

18:54.180 --> 18:58.660
And his view about the role of carbon dioxide in this warming have moved up from none to

18:58.660 --> 19:04.960
some to half to most. Despite doing numerous TV and vlog interviews,

19:04.960 --> 19:10.500
no one seems to have noticed this subtle shift in position over the last 25 years or asked

19:10.500 --> 19:15.380
Spencer about it. So this brings us back to where we started.

19:15.380 --> 19:20.220
Far from failing, the climate models have proved to be remarkably accurate, while Spencer's

19:20.220 --> 19:26.060
predictions pretty much all failed. Spencer has had to change his position several

19:26.060 --> 19:31.720
times to keep up and has moved closer and closer to the published science.

19:31.720 --> 19:37.860
So will he take that extra last step? My prediction is that he can't.

19:37.860 --> 19:43.460
If he accepts that the increase in CO2 concentration is responsible for recent warming, that would

19:43.460 --> 19:48.980
go against his fundamental religious belief that God is in charge of the climate.

19:49.020 --> 19:55.140
And if he accepts that a doubling of CO2 concentration will lead to a rise of around 3 degrees centigrade

19:55.140 --> 20:00.320
and keep rising as we burn more fossil fuels, then his doctrine that God has given the Earth

20:00.320 --> 20:06.180
a self-regulating climate is dead. Abandoning a scientific conclusion in the

20:06.180 --> 20:12.460
face of overwhelming contrary evidence is easy. Abandoning a fundamental religious belief

20:12.460 --> 20:14.540
seems to be much, much harder.

20:18.980 --> 20:22.980
