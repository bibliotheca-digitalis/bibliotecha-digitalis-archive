1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,480
I got several requests to correct Bill Whittle's video, Is Climate Change Real?

2
00:00:04,480 --> 00:00:10,640
As always, I'll list all his sources as well as my own peer-reviewed scientific sources in the video description

3
00:00:11,200 --> 00:00:13,200
so that you can check them for yourselves.

4
00:00:14,160 --> 00:00:16,880
Let's take all his claims in chronological order.

5
00:00:17,160 --> 00:00:23,600
We'll start with this projection for global sea level, which is currently rising at the rate of about three millimeters a year.

6
00:00:24,120 --> 00:00:27,680
See now three millimeters a year. That means in 100 years

7
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,080
I wish I had a science guy here to check my numbers

8
00:00:33,360 --> 00:00:35,080
We'll be up to

9
00:00:35,080 --> 00:00:39,720
300 millimeters. Boy, that's 11.8 inches. That's almost a foot.

10
00:00:39,720 --> 00:00:44,400
Whittle's five-second calculation assumes that the rate of sea level rise remains constant.

11
00:00:44,600 --> 00:00:49,460
But we all know that when the climate's changing the sea level doesn't remain constant.

12
00:00:49,880 --> 00:00:53,120
According to researchers, sea level rise will soon start to accelerate.

13
00:00:53,680 --> 00:00:59,940
Firstly, because we're seeing accelerating melt from ice sheets and glaciers and because ocean temperatures are rising

14
00:01:00,160 --> 00:01:02,840
and warmer oceans leads to thermal expansion.

15
00:01:03,440 --> 00:01:08,280
There are a couple of ways to work out how much sea level rise we'll get from these two phenomena.

16
00:01:08,520 --> 00:01:14,240
One is to figure out on paper how much ice ought to melt and how much the oceans ought to expand

17
00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:21,080
due to a given rise in global temperature. And that gave an average figure of about three feet by the end of this century.

18
00:01:21,760 --> 00:01:29,120
The other method is to see how much sea levels have risen in the past in response to a similar increase in global temperature.

19
00:01:29,440 --> 00:01:36,740
And when two different studies measured that, they found that the answer again came to about three feet by the end of this century.

20
00:01:37,480 --> 00:01:42,160
I'm only looking at the average, so here are the exact figures for various different studies.

21
00:01:42,860 --> 00:01:48,720
A more recent study has now doubled that estimate to around six feet by the end of this century.

22
00:01:49,120 --> 00:01:51,760
And after that, of course, they would keep rising.

23
00:01:52,600 --> 00:02:00,120
Whittle broached this subject because he was criticising Bill Nye for talking in a video about a sea level rise of 70 metres

24
00:02:00,120 --> 00:02:05,800
if all the ice on Earth melts, without mentioning that this process would take thousands of years.

25
00:02:06,280 --> 00:02:10,480
If all this ice melts, the ocean is going to have more water in it.

26
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:16,760
So the sea levels, as measured from the coasts, is going to go up. It's going to go up 70 metres.

27
00:02:17,760 --> 00:02:23,320
And Whittle's right to criticise. Nye should have told people that this will take thousands of years.

28
00:02:23,320 --> 00:02:28,880
Al Gore did the same thing when he talked about a rise of 20 feet, but didn't mention the timeline.

29
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:34,000
By the same token, Whittle has an obligation to report the sea level studies

30
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:39,480
and not make up his own sea level projection based on a spurious calculation in his head.

31
00:02:39,480 --> 00:02:43,680
If he thinks all these studies are wrong, then he needs to explain why.

32
00:02:44,280 --> 00:02:49,680
Because whether you want to accept these studies or not, whether you think these conclusions are important or not,

33
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:55,920
you still have a right to know about them, just as you have a right to know how long it'll take for all the ice to melt.

34
00:02:56,400 --> 00:03:01,400
Science tells us that during the late Cretaceous period, around 80 million years ago or so,

35
00:03:01,400 --> 00:03:05,600
Kansas was directly under the Western Interior Seaway.

36
00:03:05,600 --> 00:03:12,840
It was a vast inland ocean, 2,000 miles long, 600 miles wide and 2,500 feet deep.

37
00:03:12,840 --> 00:03:18,840
But 80 million years ago, CO2 levels were about 1,000 parts per million.

38
00:03:18,840 --> 00:03:25,240
In fact, during the Cambrian period, 500 million years ago, CO2 levels were perhaps 7,000 parts per million.

39
00:03:25,240 --> 00:03:29,240
OK, now we have to join up the dots and hear the other half of the story.

40
00:03:29,240 --> 00:03:37,840
Whittle's quite right. During the late Cretaceous, CO2 levels were about 1,000 parts per million compared to 400 million today,

41
00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:40,840
and 7,000 parts per million during the Cambrian.

42
00:03:40,840 --> 00:03:45,840
So what was the consequence of these high levels of CO2?

43
00:03:45,840 --> 00:03:51,840
According to science, as Whittle puts it, they should have caused much stronger global warming than we see today.

44
00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:53,840
And they did.

45
00:03:53,840 --> 00:03:57,840
During both periods, it was so hot that the ice melted at the poles.

46
00:03:57,840 --> 00:04:01,840
And what was the result? Sea level rise.

47
00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:08,840
During the Cretaceous, combined with eustatic movement, it led to the highest sea level in several hundred million years.

48
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:12,840
This is the rest of the world during the Cretaceous.

49
00:04:12,840 --> 00:04:17,840
So Whittle was right in saying CO2 levels were much higher during the Cretaceous.

50
00:04:17,840 --> 00:04:24,840
And he was right in saying that half of the USA was underwater during the Cretaceous, but he didn't explain the connection.

51
00:04:24,840 --> 00:04:30,840
Al Gore and the rest of the crowd sold the American people, in fact the entire world, on this.

52
00:04:30,840 --> 00:04:38,840
This is a graph of pretty much stable temperatures than a drastic, unprecedented rise corresponding to fossil fuel use.

53
00:04:38,840 --> 00:04:42,840
This chart that they used goes back a thousand years.

54
00:04:42,840 --> 00:04:44,840
Wow.

55
00:04:44,840 --> 00:04:48,840
Hey, here's a world temperature chart that goes back 11,000 years.

56
00:04:48,840 --> 00:04:53,840
The little red bar you see is the length of the hockey stick sample that got this ball rolling in the first place.

57
00:04:53,840 --> 00:04:55,840
Well, not quite.

58
00:04:55,840 --> 00:05:07,840
What got this ball rolling was a theory by Svante Arrhenius in 1894 that since CO2 traps longwave radiation, an increase in the concentration of atmospheric CO2 would lead to global warming.

59
00:05:07,840 --> 00:05:16,840
That theory was refined by Guy Stewart Callender in the 1930s and 40s and confirmed by a number of researchers in the 1950s and 60s.

60
00:05:16,840 --> 00:05:26,840
As for this reconstruction, it was just the first of a dozen reconstructions, each one showing a steep rise in temperatures over the last 100 years.

61
00:05:26,840 --> 00:05:33,840
But the point Whittle wants to make is that we need to compare this to global temperatures over the last 11,000 years.

62
00:05:33,840 --> 00:05:37,840
So let's go back to this reconstruction. What was it again?

63
00:05:37,840 --> 00:05:38,840
Here's a world temperature chart.

64
00:05:38,840 --> 00:05:44,840
If it's a world temperature chart, why does it say GISP2, Greenland?

65
00:05:44,840 --> 00:05:53,840
It took me less than a minute to discover that this reconstruction is based on just one location, the GISP2 drilling site on top of the Greenland ice sheet.

66
00:05:53,840 --> 00:05:56,840
Here's the original graph that Whittle used.

67
00:05:56,840 --> 00:06:03,840
It comes from a blog and it seems to be a faithful reproduction of the data, but as we'll see in a minute, it's a bit misleading.

68
00:06:03,840 --> 00:06:06,840
First, let's remind ourselves of Whittle's claim.

69
00:06:06,840 --> 00:06:11,840
The little red bar you see is the length of the hockey stick sample that got this ball rolling in the first place.

70
00:06:11,840 --> 00:06:23,840
The problem is whoever added the red line for Bill Whittle's video either assumed or pretended that the reconstruction ends at roughly the same time as the hockey stick curve, but it doesn't.

71
00:06:23,840 --> 00:06:27,840
The hockey stick ends roughly in the year 2000, as is shown on the scale.

72
00:06:27,840 --> 00:06:33,840
The GISP2 graph ends in zero, which represents the present.

73
00:06:33,840 --> 00:06:41,840
Now you may think that that means the year 2000 or 2017 or whenever the graph was made, but it doesn't.

74
00:06:41,840 --> 00:06:49,840
To avoid confusion like this and make reconstructions consistent, scientists always use the year 1950 as a baseline.

75
00:06:49,840 --> 00:06:57,840
So on the GISP2 data set here, BP, or before present, means before 1950.

76
00:06:57,840 --> 00:07:07,840
Wait, there's more. If we zoom in on the small time period we're talking about, the last 1000 years, we can see that the data even stopped short of 1950.

77
00:07:07,840 --> 00:07:14,840
And that's not a few years short, it's several decades short, because this black line represents 500 years.

78
00:07:14,840 --> 00:07:16,840
So what is the end point?

79
00:07:17,840 --> 00:07:23,840
To find out, I accessed the raw data from GISP2, which is freely available on the internet.

80
00:07:23,840 --> 00:07:30,840
And it turns out that the youngest data sample is 0.0951409000 years before present.

81
00:07:30,840 --> 00:07:39,840
0.0951409000 years is 95 years, and before present means before 1950.

82
00:07:39,840 --> 00:07:44,840
So 95 years before 1950 is 1855.

83
00:07:44,840 --> 00:07:52,840
So in fact, the data graph ends in 1855, decades before the sharp increase in warming shown by the hockey stick graphs.

84
00:07:52,840 --> 00:07:57,840
So that's comparing chalk and cheese. Let's compare like with like.

85
00:07:57,840 --> 00:08:04,840
Firstly, we'll look at global temperatures over the last 11,000 years, which is what Whittle claimed he was showing us.

86
00:08:04,840 --> 00:08:09,840
And we'll take temperatures up to the 21st century instead of 1855.

87
00:08:10,840 --> 00:08:15,840
This study by Marcotte et al. in 2013 does exactly that.

88
00:08:15,840 --> 00:08:22,840
The grey curves at the end show instrumental data representing the rise in temperatures since 1950.

89
00:08:22,840 --> 00:08:27,840
As you can see, temperatures are now the highest they've been in the last 11,000 years.

90
00:08:27,840 --> 00:08:34,840
And the rise is steep and sudden over the last 100 years, completely in line with the sudden rise of the hockey stick curve.

91
00:08:34,840 --> 00:08:40,840
Here's the last 1,000 years covered by the hockey stick graph, also reflecting that sudden rise.

92
00:08:40,840 --> 00:08:48,840
Again, this sudden increase in temperature may not bother you, but Whittle has an obligation to at least present you with these facts.

93
00:08:48,840 --> 00:08:51,840
Otherwise, he's only telling half the story.

94
00:08:51,840 --> 00:08:58,840
So let's just run that clip of Whittle again, this time putting in the graph he's describing, which is world temperatures,

95
00:08:58,840 --> 00:09:03,840
and the timescale he's claiming to cover, which is up to the 21st century.

96
00:09:03,840 --> 00:09:06,840
Here's a world temperature chart that goes back 11,000 years.

97
00:09:06,840 --> 00:09:11,840
The little red bar you see is the length of the hockey stick sample that got this ball rolling in the first place.

98
00:09:11,840 --> 00:09:13,840
What a difference that makes.

99
00:09:13,840 --> 00:09:16,840
OK, back to the wrong graph and more of the video.

100
00:09:16,840 --> 00:09:22,840
Temperatures have been in constant flux for the last 11,000 years.

101
00:09:24,840 --> 00:09:27,840
And the last 450,000 years.

102
00:09:28,840 --> 00:09:33,840
And for the last 4.6 billion years.

103
00:09:33,840 --> 00:09:35,840
There's nothing before that here on Earth.

104
00:09:35,840 --> 00:09:39,840
The blue line here, by the way, is temperature. The purple is CO2 levels.

105
00:09:39,840 --> 00:09:46,840
Now there's a scientific term for this delta, this rise and fall of temperatures, and that scientific term is called change.

106
00:09:46,840 --> 00:09:55,840
Constant rhythmic climate change and nothing but constant rhythmic climate change going back not 1,000 years,

107
00:09:55,840 --> 00:09:57,840
but 4.6 billion years.

108
00:09:57,840 --> 00:09:59,840
The climate's always changing.

109
00:09:59,840 --> 00:10:05,840
It's like warning us about daylight change because the sun is getting closer to the horizon.

110
00:10:05,840 --> 00:10:08,840
That's true, but there's kind of more to the story, isn't there?

111
00:10:08,840 --> 00:10:10,840
Yes, there's much more to the story.

112
00:10:10,840 --> 00:10:15,840
Scientists haven't spent the last 100 years discovering that climate's always changing.

113
00:10:15,840 --> 00:10:18,840
They've been discovering why it changes.

114
00:10:18,840 --> 00:10:23,840
Whittle's hinted at the reason, so let's fill in the other half of the story.

115
00:10:23,840 --> 00:10:32,840
As Whittle explained, the Cambrian period had exceptionally high levels of CO2, around 7,000 parts per million, compared to 400 today.

116
00:10:32,840 --> 00:10:36,840
The result was hyper-warming and the Cambrian hot house.

117
00:10:36,840 --> 00:10:43,840
And this happened at a time when solar output was about 4% weaker, which should have caused an ice age.

118
00:10:43,840 --> 00:10:48,840
It was carbon dioxide that kept the planet not just warm, but much hotter than now.

119
00:10:48,840 --> 00:10:57,840
And since then, carbon dioxide has been on a slow downward cooling trend, with occasional rises in CO concentration that sent temperatures back up.

120
00:10:57,840 --> 00:11:02,840
But if we look at the reconstruction behind Whittle, which comes from a blog,

121
00:11:02,840 --> 00:11:08,840
what he's trying to show us is that there seems to be no correlation between temperature and carbon dioxide.

122
00:11:08,840 --> 00:11:16,840
What he doesn't show us is that the same temperature graph set against solar luminosity also shows no correlation.

123
00:11:16,840 --> 00:11:19,840
So here's the other half of the story.

124
00:11:19,840 --> 00:11:27,840
Over the last 500 million years, as CO2 levels have trended downwards, solar luminosity has been trending upwards.

125
00:11:27,840 --> 00:11:30,840
In other words, the Sun's been getting hotter.

126
00:11:30,840 --> 00:11:35,840
You don't need a physics degree to know that the Sun is an important influence on global temperature.

127
00:11:35,840 --> 00:11:41,840
So if the Sun's been getting steadily hotter, why hasn't the Earth also been getting steadily hotter?

128
00:11:41,840 --> 00:11:44,840
There's no correlation at all.

129
00:11:44,840 --> 00:11:52,840
But when researchers factored in the effect of the Sun and CO2 on global temperatures, they got a very good correlation.

130
00:11:52,840 --> 00:11:56,840
Since the Sun's rising output has been slow and predictable,

131
00:11:56,840 --> 00:12:01,840
it's the ups and downs of carbon dioxide that forced the changes in global temperature.

132
00:12:01,840 --> 00:12:08,840
That's why carbon dioxide has been called the Earth's thermostat and the primary driver of phanerozoic climate.

133
00:12:08,840 --> 00:12:11,840
A couple of quick questions for you, science guys.

134
00:12:11,840 --> 00:12:15,840
How did CO2 levels go from a Cambrian high of 7,000 parts per million

135
00:12:15,840 --> 00:12:21,840
to a quaternary low of about 180 parts per million without Bill Nye, Al Gore, Leonardo DiCaprio...

136
00:12:21,840 --> 00:12:26,840
Well, that's easy because the answer can be looked up in any good geology textbook.

137
00:12:26,840 --> 00:12:30,840
Carbon dioxide was removed over time through chemical weathering.

138
00:12:30,840 --> 00:12:35,840
This is a process by which CO2 and water from the atmosphere make carbonic acid,

139
00:12:35,840 --> 00:12:38,840
which reacts with rock minerals to form carbonates.

140
00:12:38,840 --> 00:12:43,840
The most common reaction is with calcium silicates, making calcium carbonate.

141
00:12:43,840 --> 00:12:50,840
This gets washed out to sea, where it eventually sinks and forms a sedimentary rock called limestone.

142
00:12:50,840 --> 00:12:56,840
Carbon was also taken out of the atmosphere by living organisms and buried as coal and oil.

143
00:12:56,840 --> 00:13:04,840
And to answer the other part of Bill's question, yes, all this really did happen without Bill Nye or Leonardo DiCaprio.

144
00:13:04,840 --> 00:13:07,840
By the way, this isn't my theory. I'm a complete dunce.

145
00:13:07,840 --> 00:13:12,840
I'm just reporting what researchers have concluded through a century of solid evidence.

146
00:13:12,840 --> 00:13:19,840
Anyone can look this up by spending five minutes at the local library or searching scientific papers online.

147
00:13:19,840 --> 00:13:23,840
The removal of atmospheric CO2 over 200 million years

148
00:13:23,840 --> 00:13:27,840
brought the concentration down to a low point during the Carboniferous.

149
00:13:27,840 --> 00:13:34,840
Then over a few million years it went shooting back up again thanks to a flood basalt event called the Siberian Traps.

150
00:13:34,840 --> 00:13:41,840
A flood basalt is caused by a weak area of crust that sends out thousands of cubic miles of molten rock,

151
00:13:41,840 --> 00:13:44,840
in this case covering a large part of Siberia.

152
00:13:44,840 --> 00:13:48,840
That event released huge amounts of CO2.

153
00:13:48,840 --> 00:13:52,840
It's important to note that the build-up of CO2 sent temperatures soaring.

154
00:13:52,840 --> 00:13:58,840
At the end of it there was a mass extinction event, wiping out 90% of the species on Earth.

155
00:13:58,840 --> 00:14:05,840
Some researchers have found evidence that the Earth became so warm it caused methane hydrates on the sea floor to vaporize,

156
00:14:05,840 --> 00:14:09,840
adding even more CO2 and accelerating the warming.

157
00:14:09,840 --> 00:14:15,840
Then the process of weathering out the carbon dioxide began again. Next question?

158
00:14:15,840 --> 00:14:21,840
Whose factories and auto emissions got CO2 to 2.5 times current levels 80 million years ago?

159
00:14:21,840 --> 00:14:25,840
Another answer that can be easily found in any geology textbook.

160
00:14:25,840 --> 00:14:32,840
First build, you have to get away from the crazy idea that carbon dioxide can only be produced by cars and factories.

161
00:14:32,840 --> 00:14:35,840
You said the same thing in an interview with Front Page Mag,

162
00:14:35,840 --> 00:14:40,840
where you explained why you started questioning climate science in the first place.

163
00:14:40,840 --> 00:14:48,840
I thought, well, if it was ice-free 20 million years ago, whose SUVs caused it to be ice-free 20 million years ago?

164
00:14:48,840 --> 00:14:55,840
Again, you seem to think that SUVs and modern industrial machines are the only things that can produce huge quantities of CO2.

165
00:14:55,840 --> 00:15:02,840
Something else can do it, a flood basalt. Fortunately, we're not experiencing any of these at the moment.

166
00:15:02,840 --> 00:15:11,840
But in answer to your question, the increase in carbon dioxide 80 million years ago was caused by a flood basalt event called the Deccan Traps.

167
00:15:11,840 --> 00:15:18,840
Just as in Siberia, it produced thousands of cubic miles of basalt and billions of tonnes of carbon dioxide.

168
00:15:18,840 --> 00:15:21,840
You can still see this basalt today.

169
00:15:21,840 --> 00:15:29,840
After that, the slow weathering process continued, bringing atmospheric CO2 concentration back to the level it was during the Carboniferous.

170
00:15:29,840 --> 00:15:35,840
Two and a half million years ago, that's the period covered by the tiny blue line you can see in the corner,

171
00:15:35,840 --> 00:15:41,840
an ice age began, and the Earth has been cycling in and out of glaciations every 30,000 years or so,

172
00:15:41,840 --> 00:15:47,840
as a wobble in the Earth's tilt and orbit allowed a little more or a little less sunlight to fall on Earth,

173
00:15:47,840 --> 00:15:55,840
and this in turn either degassed or dissolved CO2 in the oceans, which in turn either melted or expanded the ice sheets.

174
00:15:55,840 --> 00:16:01,840
This regular cycle of glaciation and deglaciation is the reconstruction whittles showing here.

175
00:16:01,840 --> 00:16:05,840
But all he said about this was that they show the climate's changed.

176
00:16:05,840 --> 00:16:12,840
He left out the reason why it's changed and the crucial part that carbon dioxide has played in those changes.

177
00:16:12,840 --> 00:16:18,840
The posts I'm going to get in response to this video are so predictable I can address them in advance.

178
00:16:18,840 --> 00:16:24,840
First there are going to be the what about questions, repeating myths that are circulating on the internet.

179
00:16:24,840 --> 00:16:28,840
You'll find all these myths addressed in my climate change videos,

180
00:16:28,840 --> 00:16:33,840
so check out the video description here to find out where you'll find your favourite myth addressed.

181
00:16:33,840 --> 00:16:36,840
Then there'll be a flood of posts complaining about my voice,

182
00:16:36,840 --> 00:16:40,840
and I'm sure a lot of people are going to write in and tell me I missed the point.

183
00:16:40,840 --> 00:16:45,840
There are various points, but the main one would be that Whittle isn't attacking climate science,

184
00:16:45,840 --> 00:16:50,840
he's attacking left-wing idiots who don't tell the whole story. Yes, I get it.

185
00:16:50,840 --> 00:16:57,840
See, this video isn't about temperatures. It's about the fundamental integrity of science being weaponised into politics.

186
00:16:57,840 --> 00:17:03,840
And I couldn't agree more. I don't care whether it's left-wingers or right-wingers misrepresenting the science.

187
00:17:03,840 --> 00:17:06,840
Any misrepresentation of science is wrong.

188
00:17:06,840 --> 00:17:14,840
So for the 28 seconds Whittle spent criticising Bill Nye's omission of the ice melt timescale, I heartily concur.

189
00:17:14,840 --> 00:17:20,840
But then Whittle spends the rest of the video, the next 8 minutes, not attacking left-wingers,

190
00:17:20,840 --> 00:17:27,840
but promoting his own view of climate science and misrepresenting the conclusions of peer-reviewed scientific studies.

191
00:17:27,840 --> 00:17:32,840
In other words, doing exactly what Bill Nye did and more.

192
00:17:32,840 --> 00:17:42,840
Whittle only told us half the story by talking about past sea level rise and past carbon dioxide rise without telling us the connection between the two.

193
00:17:42,840 --> 00:17:50,840
He mentioned past CO2 levels of 7000ppm and 1000ppm without mentioning the hothouse conditions that resulted.

194
00:17:50,840 --> 00:18:01,840
He was telling us again and again that the climate always changes while leaving out half the story, the scientific explanation as to why the climate changes.

195
00:18:01,840 --> 00:18:05,840
And he left out the crucial role of the sun in past climate change.

196
00:18:05,840 --> 00:18:08,840
Telling half of that truth is not science, it's fraud.

197
00:18:08,840 --> 00:18:12,840
OK, that's pretty damning. But I'm not done yet.

198
00:18:12,840 --> 00:18:15,840
Those were just the crucial facts you left out, Bill.

199
00:18:15,840 --> 00:18:23,840
Worse still are the parts of your video where you misled people, telling us the data shows sea level rise will be less than a foot by the end of the century,

200
00:18:23,840 --> 00:18:27,840
when in fact studies conclude there will be a sea level rise three times higher.

201
00:18:27,840 --> 00:18:32,840
And you're telling us that this is a reconstruction of world temperatures when it's not,

202
00:18:32,840 --> 00:18:37,840
and telling us this portion represents the period of the hockey stick curve when it doesn't,

203
00:18:37,840 --> 00:18:45,840
and that misrepresentation meant people couldn't get to see real world temperatures and the real nature of recent temperature increase for themselves.

204
00:18:45,840 --> 00:18:50,840
Now we come to the thorny question of why Bill Whittle didn't tell the whole story,

205
00:18:50,840 --> 00:18:54,840
and couldn't answer his own questions and even misrepresented the science.

206
00:18:54,840 --> 00:18:57,840
After all, isn't he a scientist?

207
00:18:57,840 --> 00:19:03,840
I taught astronomy for 20 years and I've been a technician in a geochronology lab using thermoluminescence to date pottery shards,

208
00:19:03,840 --> 00:19:08,840
so while I may not be a climate scientist, and neither is Bill Nye by the way, who has a degree in mechanical engineering,

209
00:19:08,840 --> 00:19:12,840
I at least know what real science looks like.

210
00:19:12,840 --> 00:19:18,840
But I couldn't find any record of Whittle having any qualifications in astronomy or teaching astronomy.

211
00:19:18,840 --> 00:19:22,840
The best I could find was that he told Front Page Mag in that interview,

212
00:19:22,840 --> 00:19:29,840
I worked as an astronomy lab assistant and I worked in a geochronology lab for four to five years,

213
00:19:29,840 --> 00:19:32,840
so I know a little bit about science.

214
00:19:32,840 --> 00:19:39,840
But it doesn't matter if you've got a PhD, even someone who knows a little bit about science should have been able to look stuff up.

215
00:19:39,840 --> 00:19:44,840
I'm a complete dunce, but even I managed to find the other half of the story.

216
00:19:44,840 --> 00:19:52,840
Neither is his impressive 20 years teaching astronomy, mentioned anywhere in the bio Whittle wrote for himself on his YouTube channel.

217
00:19:52,840 --> 00:19:55,840
Instead it's all about politics.

218
00:19:55,840 --> 00:20:01,840
Bill Whittle is considered by many politico insiders to be the hottest up and coming conservative political commentator

219
00:20:01,840 --> 00:20:05,840
and American heritage philosopher of his time.

220
00:20:05,840 --> 00:20:10,840
Now Whittle can rail against the politicisation of science when it comes to social sciences,

221
00:20:10,840 --> 00:20:18,840
feminism, gender identity and all the other stuff that seems to be preoccupying so many people in the United States these days.

222
00:20:18,840 --> 00:20:22,840
So by definition a lot of that is political.

223
00:20:22,840 --> 00:20:29,840
But Whittle goes on for the rest of the video to misrepresent hard sciences like physics, geology and glaciology.

224
00:20:29,840 --> 00:20:35,840
Why would a political commentator who only knows a little bit about science want to do that?

225
00:20:35,840 --> 00:20:40,840
It's about the fundamental integrity of science being weaponised into politics.

226
00:20:40,840 --> 00:20:42,840
I couldn't have put it better myself.
