0	4480	I got several requests to correct Bill Whittle's video, Is Climate Change Real?
4480	10640	As always, I'll list all his sources as well as my own peer-reviewed scientific sources in the video description
11200	13200	so that you can check them for yourselves.
14160	16880	Let's take all his claims in chronological order.
17160	23600	We'll start with this projection for global sea level, which is currently rising at the rate of about three millimeters a year.
24120	27680	See now three millimeters a year. That means in 100 years
30000	32080	I wish I had a science guy here to check my numbers
33360	35080	We'll be up to
35080	39720	300 millimeters. Boy, that's 11.8 inches. That's almost a foot.
39720	44400	Whittle's five-second calculation assumes that the rate of sea level rise remains constant.
44600	49460	But we all know that when the climate's changing the sea level doesn't remain constant.
49880	53120	According to researchers, sea level rise will soon start to accelerate.
53680	59940	Firstly, because we're seeing accelerating melt from ice sheets and glaciers and because ocean temperatures are rising
60160	62840	and warmer oceans leads to thermal expansion.
63440	68280	There are a couple of ways to work out how much sea level rise we'll get from these two phenomena.
68520	74240	One is to figure out on paper how much ice ought to melt and how much the oceans ought to expand
74240	81080	due to a given rise in global temperature. And that gave an average figure of about three feet by the end of this century.
81760	89120	The other method is to see how much sea levels have risen in the past in response to a similar increase in global temperature.
89440	96740	And when two different studies measured that, they found that the answer again came to about three feet by the end of this century.
97480	102160	I'm only looking at the average, so here are the exact figures for various different studies.
102860	108720	A more recent study has now doubled that estimate to around six feet by the end of this century.
109120	111760	And after that, of course, they would keep rising.
112600	120120	Whittle broached this subject because he was criticising Bill Nye for talking in a video about a sea level rise of 70 metres
120120	125800	if all the ice on Earth melts, without mentioning that this process would take thousands of years.
126280	130480	If all this ice melts, the ocean is going to have more water in it.
130560	136760	So the sea levels, as measured from the coasts, is going to go up. It's going to go up 70 metres.
137760	143320	And Whittle's right to criticise. Nye should have told people that this will take thousands of years.
143320	148880	Al Gore did the same thing when he talked about a rise of 20 feet, but didn't mention the timeline.
149280	154000	By the same token, Whittle has an obligation to report the sea level studies
154000	159480	and not make up his own sea level projection based on a spurious calculation in his head.
159480	163680	If he thinks all these studies are wrong, then he needs to explain why.
164280	169680	Because whether you want to accept these studies or not, whether you think these conclusions are important or not,
169680	175920	you still have a right to know about them, just as you have a right to know how long it'll take for all the ice to melt.
176400	181400	Science tells us that during the late Cretaceous period, around 80 million years ago or so,
181400	185600	Kansas was directly under the Western Interior Seaway.
185600	192840	It was a vast inland ocean, 2,000 miles long, 600 miles wide and 2,500 feet deep.
192840	198840	But 80 million years ago, CO2 levels were about 1,000 parts per million.
198840	205240	In fact, during the Cambrian period, 500 million years ago, CO2 levels were perhaps 7,000 parts per million.
205240	209240	OK, now we have to join up the dots and hear the other half of the story.
209240	217840	Whittle's quite right. During the late Cretaceous, CO2 levels were about 1,000 parts per million compared to 400 million today,
217840	220840	and 7,000 parts per million during the Cambrian.
220840	225840	So what was the consequence of these high levels of CO2?
225840	231840	According to science, as Whittle puts it, they should have caused much stronger global warming than we see today.
231840	233840	And they did.
233840	237840	During both periods, it was so hot that the ice melted at the poles.
237840	241840	And what was the result? Sea level rise.
241840	248840	During the Cretaceous, combined with eustatic movement, it led to the highest sea level in several hundred million years.
249840	252840	This is the rest of the world during the Cretaceous.
252840	257840	So Whittle was right in saying CO2 levels were much higher during the Cretaceous.
257840	264840	And he was right in saying that half of the USA was underwater during the Cretaceous, but he didn't explain the connection.
264840	270840	Al Gore and the rest of the crowd sold the American people, in fact the entire world, on this.
270840	278840	This is a graph of pretty much stable temperatures than a drastic, unprecedented rise corresponding to fossil fuel use.
278840	282840	This chart that they used goes back a thousand years.
282840	284840	Wow.
284840	288840	Hey, here's a world temperature chart that goes back 11,000 years.
288840	293840	The little red bar you see is the length of the hockey stick sample that got this ball rolling in the first place.
293840	295840	Well, not quite.
295840	307840	What got this ball rolling was a theory by Svante Arrhenius in 1894 that since CO2 traps longwave radiation, an increase in the concentration of atmospheric CO2 would lead to global warming.
307840	316840	That theory was refined by Guy Stewart Callender in the 1930s and 40s and confirmed by a number of researchers in the 1950s and 60s.
316840	326840	As for this reconstruction, it was just the first of a dozen reconstructions, each one showing a steep rise in temperatures over the last 100 years.
326840	333840	But the point Whittle wants to make is that we need to compare this to global temperatures over the last 11,000 years.
333840	337840	So let's go back to this reconstruction. What was it again?
337840	338840	Here's a world temperature chart.
338840	344840	If it's a world temperature chart, why does it say GISP2, Greenland?
344840	353840	It took me less than a minute to discover that this reconstruction is based on just one location, the GISP2 drilling site on top of the Greenland ice sheet.
353840	356840	Here's the original graph that Whittle used.
356840	363840	It comes from a blog and it seems to be a faithful reproduction of the data, but as we'll see in a minute, it's a bit misleading.
363840	366840	First, let's remind ourselves of Whittle's claim.
366840	371840	The little red bar you see is the length of the hockey stick sample that got this ball rolling in the first place.
371840	383840	The problem is whoever added the red line for Bill Whittle's video either assumed or pretended that the reconstruction ends at roughly the same time as the hockey stick curve, but it doesn't.
383840	387840	The hockey stick ends roughly in the year 2000, as is shown on the scale.
387840	393840	The GISP2 graph ends in zero, which represents the present.
393840	401840	Now you may think that that means the year 2000 or 2017 or whenever the graph was made, but it doesn't.
401840	409840	To avoid confusion like this and make reconstructions consistent, scientists always use the year 1950 as a baseline.
409840	417840	So on the GISP2 data set here, BP, or before present, means before 1950.
417840	427840	Wait, there's more. If we zoom in on the small time period we're talking about, the last 1000 years, we can see that the data even stopped short of 1950.
427840	434840	And that's not a few years short, it's several decades short, because this black line represents 500 years.
434840	436840	So what is the end point?
437840	443840	To find out, I accessed the raw data from GISP2, which is freely available on the internet.
443840	450840	And it turns out that the youngest data sample is 0.0951409000 years before present.
450840	459840	0.0951409000 years is 95 years, and before present means before 1950.
459840	464840	So 95 years before 1950 is 1855.
464840	472840	So in fact, the data graph ends in 1855, decades before the sharp increase in warming shown by the hockey stick graphs.
472840	477840	So that's comparing chalk and cheese. Let's compare like with like.
477840	484840	Firstly, we'll look at global temperatures over the last 11,000 years, which is what Whittle claimed he was showing us.
484840	489840	And we'll take temperatures up to the 21st century instead of 1855.
490840	495840	This study by Marcotte et al. in 2013 does exactly that.
495840	502840	The grey curves at the end show instrumental data representing the rise in temperatures since 1950.
502840	507840	As you can see, temperatures are now the highest they've been in the last 11,000 years.
507840	514840	And the rise is steep and sudden over the last 100 years, completely in line with the sudden rise of the hockey stick curve.
514840	520840	Here's the last 1,000 years covered by the hockey stick graph, also reflecting that sudden rise.
520840	528840	Again, this sudden increase in temperature may not bother you, but Whittle has an obligation to at least present you with these facts.
528840	531840	Otherwise, he's only telling half the story.
531840	538840	So let's just run that clip of Whittle again, this time putting in the graph he's describing, which is world temperatures,
538840	543840	and the timescale he's claiming to cover, which is up to the 21st century.
543840	546840	Here's a world temperature chart that goes back 11,000 years.
546840	551840	The little red bar you see is the length of the hockey stick sample that got this ball rolling in the first place.
551840	553840	What a difference that makes.
553840	556840	OK, back to the wrong graph and more of the video.
556840	562840	Temperatures have been in constant flux for the last 11,000 years.
564840	567840	And the last 450,000 years.
568840	573840	And for the last 4.6 billion years.
573840	575840	There's nothing before that here on Earth.
575840	579840	The blue line here, by the way, is temperature. The purple is CO2 levels.
579840	586840	Now there's a scientific term for this delta, this rise and fall of temperatures, and that scientific term is called change.
586840	595840	Constant rhythmic climate change and nothing but constant rhythmic climate change going back not 1,000 years,
595840	597840	but 4.6 billion years.
597840	599840	The climate's always changing.
599840	605840	It's like warning us about daylight change because the sun is getting closer to the horizon.
605840	608840	That's true, but there's kind of more to the story, isn't there?
608840	610840	Yes, there's much more to the story.
610840	615840	Scientists haven't spent the last 100 years discovering that climate's always changing.
615840	618840	They've been discovering why it changes.
618840	623840	Whittle's hinted at the reason, so let's fill in the other half of the story.
623840	632840	As Whittle explained, the Cambrian period had exceptionally high levels of CO2, around 7,000 parts per million, compared to 400 today.
632840	636840	The result was hyper-warming and the Cambrian hot house.
636840	643840	And this happened at a time when solar output was about 4% weaker, which should have caused an ice age.
643840	648840	It was carbon dioxide that kept the planet not just warm, but much hotter than now.
648840	657840	And since then, carbon dioxide has been on a slow downward cooling trend, with occasional rises in CO concentration that sent temperatures back up.
657840	662840	But if we look at the reconstruction behind Whittle, which comes from a blog,
662840	668840	what he's trying to show us is that there seems to be no correlation between temperature and carbon dioxide.
668840	676840	What he doesn't show us is that the same temperature graph set against solar luminosity also shows no correlation.
676840	679840	So here's the other half of the story.
679840	687840	Over the last 500 million years, as CO2 levels have trended downwards, solar luminosity has been trending upwards.
687840	690840	In other words, the Sun's been getting hotter.
690840	695840	You don't need a physics degree to know that the Sun is an important influence on global temperature.
695840	701840	So if the Sun's been getting steadily hotter, why hasn't the Earth also been getting steadily hotter?
701840	704840	There's no correlation at all.
704840	712840	But when researchers factored in the effect of the Sun and CO2 on global temperatures, they got a very good correlation.
712840	716840	Since the Sun's rising output has been slow and predictable,
716840	721840	it's the ups and downs of carbon dioxide that forced the changes in global temperature.
721840	728840	That's why carbon dioxide has been called the Earth's thermostat and the primary driver of phanerozoic climate.
728840	731840	A couple of quick questions for you, science guys.
731840	735840	How did CO2 levels go from a Cambrian high of 7,000 parts per million
735840	741840	to a quaternary low of about 180 parts per million without Bill Nye, Al Gore, Leonardo DiCaprio...
741840	746840	Well, that's easy because the answer can be looked up in any good geology textbook.
746840	750840	Carbon dioxide was removed over time through chemical weathering.
750840	755840	This is a process by which CO2 and water from the atmosphere make carbonic acid,
755840	758840	which reacts with rock minerals to form carbonates.
758840	763840	The most common reaction is with calcium silicates, making calcium carbonate.
763840	770840	This gets washed out to sea, where it eventually sinks and forms a sedimentary rock called limestone.
770840	776840	Carbon was also taken out of the atmosphere by living organisms and buried as coal and oil.
776840	784840	And to answer the other part of Bill's question, yes, all this really did happen without Bill Nye or Leonardo DiCaprio.
784840	787840	By the way, this isn't my theory. I'm a complete dunce.
787840	792840	I'm just reporting what researchers have concluded through a century of solid evidence.
792840	799840	Anyone can look this up by spending five minutes at the local library or searching scientific papers online.
799840	803840	The removal of atmospheric CO2 over 200 million years
803840	807840	brought the concentration down to a low point during the Carboniferous.
807840	814840	Then over a few million years it went shooting back up again thanks to a flood basalt event called the Siberian Traps.
814840	821840	A flood basalt is caused by a weak area of crust that sends out thousands of cubic miles of molten rock,
821840	824840	in this case covering a large part of Siberia.
824840	828840	That event released huge amounts of CO2.
828840	832840	It's important to note that the build-up of CO2 sent temperatures soaring.
832840	838840	At the end of it there was a mass extinction event, wiping out 90% of the species on Earth.
838840	845840	Some researchers have found evidence that the Earth became so warm it caused methane hydrates on the sea floor to vaporize,
845840	849840	adding even more CO2 and accelerating the warming.
849840	855840	Then the process of weathering out the carbon dioxide began again. Next question?
855840	861840	Whose factories and auto emissions got CO2 to 2.5 times current levels 80 million years ago?
861840	865840	Another answer that can be easily found in any geology textbook.
865840	872840	First build, you have to get away from the crazy idea that carbon dioxide can only be produced by cars and factories.
872840	875840	You said the same thing in an interview with Front Page Mag,
875840	880840	where you explained why you started questioning climate science in the first place.
880840	888840	I thought, well, if it was ice-free 20 million years ago, whose SUVs caused it to be ice-free 20 million years ago?
888840	895840	Again, you seem to think that SUVs and modern industrial machines are the only things that can produce huge quantities of CO2.
895840	902840	Something else can do it, a flood basalt. Fortunately, we're not experiencing any of these at the moment.
902840	911840	But in answer to your question, the increase in carbon dioxide 80 million years ago was caused by a flood basalt event called the Deccan Traps.
911840	918840	Just as in Siberia, it produced thousands of cubic miles of basalt and billions of tonnes of carbon dioxide.
918840	921840	You can still see this basalt today.
921840	929840	After that, the slow weathering process continued, bringing atmospheric CO2 concentration back to the level it was during the Carboniferous.
929840	935840	Two and a half million years ago, that's the period covered by the tiny blue line you can see in the corner,
935840	941840	an ice age began, and the Earth has been cycling in and out of glaciations every 30,000 years or so,
941840	947840	as a wobble in the Earth's tilt and orbit allowed a little more or a little less sunlight to fall on Earth,
947840	955840	and this in turn either degassed or dissolved CO2 in the oceans, which in turn either melted or expanded the ice sheets.
955840	961840	This regular cycle of glaciation and deglaciation is the reconstruction whittles showing here.
961840	965840	But all he said about this was that they show the climate's changed.
965840	972840	He left out the reason why it's changed and the crucial part that carbon dioxide has played in those changes.
972840	978840	The posts I'm going to get in response to this video are so predictable I can address them in advance.
978840	984840	First there are going to be the what about questions, repeating myths that are circulating on the internet.
984840	988840	You'll find all these myths addressed in my climate change videos,
988840	993840	so check out the video description here to find out where you'll find your favourite myth addressed.
993840	996840	Then there'll be a flood of posts complaining about my voice,
996840	1000840	and I'm sure a lot of people are going to write in and tell me I missed the point.
1000840	1005840	There are various points, but the main one would be that Whittle isn't attacking climate science,
1005840	1010840	he's attacking left-wing idiots who don't tell the whole story. Yes, I get it.
1010840	1017840	See, this video isn't about temperatures. It's about the fundamental integrity of science being weaponised into politics.
1017840	1023840	And I couldn't agree more. I don't care whether it's left-wingers or right-wingers misrepresenting the science.
1023840	1026840	Any misrepresentation of science is wrong.
1026840	1034840	So for the 28 seconds Whittle spent criticising Bill Nye's omission of the ice melt timescale, I heartily concur.
1034840	1040840	But then Whittle spends the rest of the video, the next 8 minutes, not attacking left-wingers,
1040840	1047840	but promoting his own view of climate science and misrepresenting the conclusions of peer-reviewed scientific studies.
1047840	1052840	In other words, doing exactly what Bill Nye did and more.
1052840	1062840	Whittle only told us half the story by talking about past sea level rise and past carbon dioxide rise without telling us the connection between the two.
1062840	1070840	He mentioned past CO2 levels of 7000ppm and 1000ppm without mentioning the hothouse conditions that resulted.
1070840	1081840	He was telling us again and again that the climate always changes while leaving out half the story, the scientific explanation as to why the climate changes.
1081840	1085840	And he left out the crucial role of the sun in past climate change.
1085840	1088840	Telling half of that truth is not science, it's fraud.
1088840	1092840	OK, that's pretty damning. But I'm not done yet.
1092840	1095840	Those were just the crucial facts you left out, Bill.
1095840	1103840	Worse still are the parts of your video where you misled people, telling us the data shows sea level rise will be less than a foot by the end of the century,
1103840	1107840	when in fact studies conclude there will be a sea level rise three times higher.
1107840	1112840	And you're telling us that this is a reconstruction of world temperatures when it's not,
1112840	1117840	and telling us this portion represents the period of the hockey stick curve when it doesn't,
1117840	1125840	and that misrepresentation meant people couldn't get to see real world temperatures and the real nature of recent temperature increase for themselves.
1125840	1130840	Now we come to the thorny question of why Bill Whittle didn't tell the whole story,
1130840	1134840	and couldn't answer his own questions and even misrepresented the science.
1134840	1137840	After all, isn't he a scientist?
1137840	1143840	I taught astronomy for 20 years and I've been a technician in a geochronology lab using thermoluminescence to date pottery shards,
1143840	1148840	so while I may not be a climate scientist, and neither is Bill Nye by the way, who has a degree in mechanical engineering,
1148840	1152840	I at least know what real science looks like.
1152840	1158840	But I couldn't find any record of Whittle having any qualifications in astronomy or teaching astronomy.
1158840	1162840	The best I could find was that he told Front Page Mag in that interview,
1162840	1169840	I worked as an astronomy lab assistant and I worked in a geochronology lab for four to five years,
1169840	1172840	so I know a little bit about science.
1172840	1179840	But it doesn't matter if you've got a PhD, even someone who knows a little bit about science should have been able to look stuff up.
1179840	1184840	I'm a complete dunce, but even I managed to find the other half of the story.
1184840	1192840	Neither is his impressive 20 years teaching astronomy, mentioned anywhere in the bio Whittle wrote for himself on his YouTube channel.
1192840	1195840	Instead it's all about politics.
1195840	1201840	Bill Whittle is considered by many politico insiders to be the hottest up and coming conservative political commentator
1201840	1205840	and American heritage philosopher of his time.
1205840	1210840	Now Whittle can rail against the politicisation of science when it comes to social sciences,
