0	4520	I always know when a new claim is doing the rounds of the blogosphere, because comments
4520	9520	start appearing on my channel from people who unquestioningly believe them.
9520	13840	So I began to suspect something was up when a couple of people claimed the Greenland ice
13840	19840	sheet was growing. A quick search on Google, and yes, here they are.
19840	24200	Greenland ice mass balance increasing, says a blog called Ice Age Now.
24200	29960	New study shows global warming non-existent for nearly two decades, says the Constitution.
29960	34800	A new study could prove to be the globalists' worst nightmare, says the blog What Did You
34800	37480	Say? I thought the worst nightmare was a banana.
37480	41680	Behold the atheists' nightmare.
41680	47080	And this is the study in question, or at least a summary of it by the Danish Meteorological
47080	49320	Institute on its website.
49320	53920	Now it's unlikely all these bloggers read the DMI website and made exactly the same
53920	59160	mistake, so as always we have to track back to find out where the original infestation
59160	62360	– I mean error – started.
62360	67240	So let's start with this blog, the Constitution, which says it's defending the Union from
67240	70920	threats foreign and domestic, which is nice.
70920	76040	It says the culmination of decades of exhausting unbiased work in the field of global climate
76040	81280	science has now gifted us with one of the clearest pictures of our planet's true environmental
81280	85860	situation, and the globalists are not going to be happy.
85860	91280	It then quotes The Daily Wire quoting The Daily Telegraph, which it turns out is quoting
91280	94820	another blog called Not a Lot of People Know That.
94820	98900	And Not a Lot of People Know That claims to have got its information from a computer model
98900	103300	by the Danish Meteorological Institute, the DMI.
103300	108040	But the bloggers are all so busy copying and quoting from one another that nobody seems
108040	114260	to have thought to check the information from the DMI to see if it's been accurately reported.
114260	118300	So a warning to those who believe the bloggers – switch off now unless you want to see
118300	121740	the actual report to find out what it really says.
121740	126260	Let's start with the Telegraph article that most bloggers were copying from by Christopher
126260	127460	Booker.
127460	132440	He makes six claims altogether in the space of just three paragraphs, so let's see how
132440	134780	many can be battered out of the ballpark.
134780	137980	We'll start with the first one.
137980	142600	Booker writes, Last week we were brought back to Earth by the Danish Meteorological Institute
142600	147760	– DMI – as chartered by our friend Paul Homewood on his blog Not a Lot of People Know
147760	152480	That, with the news that ever since December, temperatures in the Arctic have consistently
152480	155960	been lower than minus 20.
155960	160880	I don't know if that's surprisingly cold for the Arctic in winter, and Booker doesn't
160880	161880	say.
161880	164880	So let's go to his source, Paul Homewood.
164880	170080	What Homewood actually says is that temperatures have been minus 20 degrees C or more all years
170080	171080	so far.
171080	176720	That's from January 1st up till May 2nd 2017, and that temperatures are currently
176720	178720	below average.
178720	183540	And Homewood reproduces a graph from the DMI website to confirm this.
183540	185560	And sure enough, he's right.
185560	189860	Around the beginning of May, the temperatures, which is the red line, were below average
189860	191800	– that's the green line.
191800	196360	I'm sorry the graph is a bit fuzzy, but I've had to zoom in to capture the two or
196360	200920	three days of the year when the temperatures were below average.
200920	205840	If we zoom out and look at the whole graph, we can see that for the rest of the year,
205840	208280	temperatures were well above average.
208280	212320	This is what's known as cherry-picking, and it's the first ball to be batted out
212320	215120	of the ballpark.
215120	218580	Let's move on to the next claim by Christopher Booker.
218580	222520	He writes, in April, the extent of Arctic sea ice was back to where it was in April
222520	226500	13 years ago, again quoting Paul Homewood.
226500	229760	And again, that's not quite what Homewood wrote.
229760	236720	What he actually said was that average April ice extent has now been stable since 2004.
236720	237720	Has it?
237720	241960	Well, just below that claim, he shows a graph that seems to confirm it.
241960	245320	But why April, and why 2004?
245320	251880	Well, because a lot of ice was lost in 2004, so it's a good year for his starting point.
251880	256820	And if Homewood had chosen June or July or August or September or October or November
256820	262980	or December of that year, then sea ice extent would have been much bigger in 2004, and that's
262980	265220	not what he wants us to hear.
265220	270060	So he was very particular about which month and which year to cherry-pick.
270060	275460	But even choosing April 2004 doesn't disguise the downward trend line, as the graph from
275460	277800	the DMI clearly shows.
277800	282980	And if we take a look at annual Arctic sea ice extent, the decline over the last 35 years
282980	289860	is obvious even to those who prefer to cherry-pick their months.
289860	290940	Claim number three.
290940	296060	Whereas in 2008 most of the ice was extremely thin, this year most has been at least two
296060	298020	metres thick.
298020	302700	Homewood tries to support this claim with two maps from the DMI model showing ice thickness
302700	306900	for May 2008 and May 2017.
306900	311460	The reds represent thicker ice, the blues and purples thinner.
311460	316740	Now it certainly looks to me like there's more blue and purple in the 2017 map and more
316740	321220	red in the 2008 map, but that's purely subjective.
321220	326660	To Homewood it apparently looks like the opposite, and that's also in the eye of the beholder.
326660	331380	So let's dispense with the art class and look at the science, which has to do with measuring
331380	334280	and numbers and calculations.
334280	338700	We need to know exactly how much area is covered by ice that's five metres thick, how much
338700	343780	covered by ice that's three metres thick and so on according to the DMI model.
343780	348860	And that of course gives us volume, and comparing volume year by year tells us how much of the
348860	351100	ice has melted.
351100	355600	Fortunately not only has the DMI worked out the volume in their model, they've reproduced
355600	357540	their results in the insets.
357540	362120	I don't know if Homewood realised what they were, but they directly contradict what he's
362120	363620	just written.
363620	371220	Ice volume is much lower in 2017, the black line here, than 2008, the black line here.
371220	376940	Now it may be that in some parts of the Arctic ice is thicker in 2017 than 2008 and vice
376940	382900	versa, but what the DMI shows is that not only is ice extent shrinking, but ice volume
382900	387300	is also shrinking, which means there's net melt of sea ice.
387300	392620	And of course that's consistent with global warming.
392620	397100	Disclaim from Booker, the Greenland ice cap last winter increased in volume faster than
397100	399620	at any time for years.
399620	404100	Of course the Greenland ice cap always grows in winter because that's when it's cold and
404100	406980	it melts in summer when it's warm.
406980	411680	Here's the graph from the DMI reproduced by Homewood that shows it.
411680	414520	So the question is, is it growing faster?
414520	419740	In other words is the amount of snow being added every winter increasing?
419740	422940	Well that's an easy one, yes it is.
422940	427540	One of the predictions attached to global warming is that warmer air holds more moisture
427540	433220	and more moisture in the air means more precipitation in areas where rain and snow falls, like the
433220	436060	highlands and interior of Greenland.
436060	439780	So every winter more and more ice is added.
439780	443820	At this point that's all the bloggers and the Daily Telegraph will tell you.
443820	448340	But as the man who inspired me in my radio career, Paul Harvey, used to say...
448340	451020	Now the rest of the story.
451020	456360	The rest of the story is what happens in summer when there's net ice loss.
456360	460940	According to predictions, global warming will cause accelerated ice loss in summer just
460940	467980	as it causes accelerated ice accumulation in winter and that prediction matches observations.
467980	473620	This study published in Nature Climate Change shows ice accumulation in red and ice loss
473620	474620	in blue.
475140	480380	Both are increasing every year but as you can see from the graph, Greenland's ice loss
480380	484620	is increasing faster than ice accumulation.
484620	489220	Now it's possible Homewood didn't read the Nature Climate Change study but he says he
489220	495340	did read the DMI statement and that also says ice loss is greater than ice gain.
495340	500000	I know a lot of people won't believe me so read it for yourselves.
500000	505360	The DMI statement says over the year it snows more than it melts but carving of icebergs
505360	509040	also adds to the total mass budget of the ice sheet.
509040	514000	Satellite observations over the last decade show that the ice sheet is not in balance.
514000	518540	The carving loss is greater than the gain from surface mass balance and Greenland is
518540	522800	losing mass at about 200 billion tonnes a year.
522800	525800	And it even repeats that further down.
525800	530240	Satellites have observed a loss of around 200 billion tonnes a year.
530240	535080	So it's not as if this wasn't spelled out in the DMI report that Homewood's using as
535080	537880	its source.
537880	541640	Next claim, the satellites now show in recent months global temperatures have plummeted
541640	544240	by more than 0.6 degrees.
544240	547520	Yes and there is the plummeting global temperature.
547520	553320	It plummeted because there was a temperature spike in 2016 caused by El Niño.
553320	557240	There are lots of these temperature spikes and temperature rises and of course they're
557240	561880	followed by temperature falls because temperature doesn't go up in straight lines.
561880	567240	The question is do these ups and downs change the long-term temperature trend?
567240	571440	No of course they don't as a look at any temperature trend shows.
571440	574440	But Booker doesn't even accept the trend.
574440	578760	He writes, this means the global temperature trend has now shown no further warming for
578760	580360	19 years.
580400	585760	Yeah I hear this a lot and we've had claims of no temperature rise for 15 or 20 or 19
585760	591920	or 18 or 17 years and yet all the temperature measurements show clearly that there has been
591920	592920	warming.
592920	598080	So in the space of three short paragraphs that's six claims out of six battered out
598080	599840	of the ballpark.
599840	603120	And if you don't agree, well the DMI report is right there.
603120	607880	I've given a link to it in the video description so you can read it for yourselves.
607880	610960	The thing is you don't need to be a genius to do this.
610960	616920	I came bottom of my class but even I can click on a link and compare the claim with the source.
616920	621480	A lot of people tell me they've started doing that now and it clears up a lot of confusion
621480	624360	about what to believe on the internet.
624360	628920	The only thing the bloggers got right is that for a lot of people this accelerated melting
628920	632280	of the Greenland ice sheet is their worst nightmare.
632280	636800	It's what scientists were warning about as far back as the 1950s and now it's happening
636800	638300	for real.
638300	641640	You can say you don't care or you can say you're happy about it.
641640	643080	That's up to you.
643080	648000	But what you can't do is cherry pick or change the conclusion of a scientific study that
648000	652240	says it is happening in order to support your belief that it's not.
