1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,520
I always know when a new claim is doing the rounds of the blogosphere, because comments

2
00:00:04,520 --> 00:00:09,520
start appearing on my channel from people who unquestioningly believe them.

3
00:00:09,520 --> 00:00:13,840
So I began to suspect something was up when a couple of people claimed the Greenland ice

4
00:00:13,840 --> 00:00:19,840
sheet was growing. A quick search on Google, and yes, here they are.

5
00:00:19,840 --> 00:00:24,200
Greenland ice mass balance increasing, says a blog called Ice Age Now.

6
00:00:24,200 --> 00:00:29,960
New study shows global warming non-existent for nearly two decades, says the Constitution.

7
00:00:29,960 --> 00:00:34,800
A new study could prove to be the globalists' worst nightmare, says the blog What Did You

8
00:00:34,800 --> 00:00:37,480
Say? I thought the worst nightmare was a banana.

9
00:00:37,480 --> 00:00:41,680
Behold the atheists' nightmare.

10
00:00:41,680 --> 00:00:47,080
And this is the study in question, or at least a summary of it by the Danish Meteorological

11
00:00:47,080 --> 00:00:49,320
Institute on its website.

12
00:00:49,320 --> 00:00:53,920
Now it's unlikely all these bloggers read the DMI website and made exactly the same

13
00:00:53,920 --> 00:00:59,160
mistake, so as always we have to track back to find out where the original infestation

14
00:00:59,160 --> 00:01:02,360
– I mean error – started.

15
00:01:02,360 --> 00:01:07,240
So let's start with this blog, the Constitution, which says it's defending the Union from

16
00:01:07,240 --> 00:01:10,920
threats foreign and domestic, which is nice.

17
00:01:10,920 --> 00:01:16,040
It says the culmination of decades of exhausting unbiased work in the field of global climate

18
00:01:16,040 --> 00:01:21,280
science has now gifted us with one of the clearest pictures of our planet's true environmental

19
00:01:21,280 --> 00:01:25,860
situation, and the globalists are not going to be happy.

20
00:01:25,860 --> 00:01:31,280
It then quotes The Daily Wire quoting The Daily Telegraph, which it turns out is quoting

21
00:01:31,280 --> 00:01:34,820
another blog called Not a Lot of People Know That.

22
00:01:34,820 --> 00:01:38,900
And Not a Lot of People Know That claims to have got its information from a computer model

23
00:01:38,900 --> 00:01:43,300
by the Danish Meteorological Institute, the DMI.

24
00:01:43,300 --> 00:01:48,040
But the bloggers are all so busy copying and quoting from one another that nobody seems

25
00:01:48,040 --> 00:01:54,260
to have thought to check the information from the DMI to see if it's been accurately reported.

26
00:01:54,260 --> 00:01:58,300
So a warning to those who believe the bloggers – switch off now unless you want to see

27
00:01:58,300 --> 00:02:01,740
the actual report to find out what it really says.

28
00:02:01,740 --> 00:02:06,260
Let's start with the Telegraph article that most bloggers were copying from by Christopher

29
00:02:06,260 --> 00:02:07,460
Booker.

30
00:02:07,460 --> 00:02:12,440
He makes six claims altogether in the space of just three paragraphs, so let's see how

31
00:02:12,440 --> 00:02:14,780
many can be battered out of the ballpark.

32
00:02:14,780 --> 00:02:17,980
We'll start with the first one.

33
00:02:17,980 --> 00:02:22,600
Booker writes, Last week we were brought back to Earth by the Danish Meteorological Institute

34
00:02:22,600 --> 00:02:27,760
– DMI – as chartered by our friend Paul Homewood on his blog Not a Lot of People Know

35
00:02:27,760 --> 00:02:32,480
That, with the news that ever since December, temperatures in the Arctic have consistently

36
00:02:32,480 --> 00:02:35,960
been lower than minus 20.

37
00:02:35,960 --> 00:02:40,880
I don't know if that's surprisingly cold for the Arctic in winter, and Booker doesn't

38
00:02:40,880 --> 00:02:41,880
say.

39
00:02:41,880 --> 00:02:44,880
So let's go to his source, Paul Homewood.

40
00:02:44,880 --> 00:02:50,080
What Homewood actually says is that temperatures have been minus 20 degrees C or more all years

41
00:02:50,080 --> 00:02:51,080
so far.

42
00:02:51,080 --> 00:02:56,720
That's from January 1st up till May 2nd 2017, and that temperatures are currently

43
00:02:56,720 --> 00:02:58,720
below average.

44
00:02:58,720 --> 00:03:03,540
And Homewood reproduces a graph from the DMI website to confirm this.

45
00:03:03,540 --> 00:03:05,560
And sure enough, he's right.

46
00:03:05,560 --> 00:03:09,860
Around the beginning of May, the temperatures, which is the red line, were below average

47
00:03:09,860 --> 00:03:11,800
– that's the green line.

48
00:03:11,800 --> 00:03:16,360
I'm sorry the graph is a bit fuzzy, but I've had to zoom in to capture the two or

49
00:03:16,360 --> 00:03:20,920
three days of the year when the temperatures were below average.

50
00:03:20,920 --> 00:03:25,840
If we zoom out and look at the whole graph, we can see that for the rest of the year,

51
00:03:25,840 --> 00:03:28,280
temperatures were well above average.

52
00:03:28,280 --> 00:03:32,320
This is what's known as cherry-picking, and it's the first ball to be batted out

53
00:03:32,320 --> 00:03:35,120
of the ballpark.

54
00:03:35,120 --> 00:03:38,580
Let's move on to the next claim by Christopher Booker.

55
00:03:38,580 --> 00:03:42,520
He writes, in April, the extent of Arctic sea ice was back to where it was in April

56
00:03:42,520 --> 00:03:46,500
13 years ago, again quoting Paul Homewood.

57
00:03:46,500 --> 00:03:49,760
And again, that's not quite what Homewood wrote.

58
00:03:49,760 --> 00:03:56,720
What he actually said was that average April ice extent has now been stable since 2004.

59
00:03:56,720 --> 00:03:57,720
Has it?

60
00:03:57,720 --> 00:04:01,960
Well, just below that claim, he shows a graph that seems to confirm it.

61
00:04:01,960 --> 00:04:05,320
But why April, and why 2004?

62
00:04:05,320 --> 00:04:11,880
Well, because a lot of ice was lost in 2004, so it's a good year for his starting point.

63
00:04:11,880 --> 00:04:16,820
And if Homewood had chosen June or July or August or September or October or November

64
00:04:16,820 --> 00:04:22,980
or December of that year, then sea ice extent would have been much bigger in 2004, and that's

65
00:04:22,980 --> 00:04:25,220
not what he wants us to hear.

66
00:04:25,220 --> 00:04:30,060
So he was very particular about which month and which year to cherry-pick.

67
00:04:30,060 --> 00:04:35,460
But even choosing April 2004 doesn't disguise the downward trend line, as the graph from

68
00:04:35,460 --> 00:04:37,800
the DMI clearly shows.

69
00:04:37,800 --> 00:04:42,980
And if we take a look at annual Arctic sea ice extent, the decline over the last 35 years

70
00:04:42,980 --> 00:04:49,860
is obvious even to those who prefer to cherry-pick their months.

71
00:04:49,860 --> 00:04:50,940
Claim number three.

72
00:04:50,940 --> 00:04:56,060
Whereas in 2008 most of the ice was extremely thin, this year most has been at least two

73
00:04:56,060 --> 00:04:58,020
metres thick.

74
00:04:58,020 --> 00:05:02,700
Homewood tries to support this claim with two maps from the DMI model showing ice thickness

75
00:05:02,700 --> 00:05:06,900
for May 2008 and May 2017.

76
00:05:06,900 --> 00:05:11,460
The reds represent thicker ice, the blues and purples thinner.

77
00:05:11,460 --> 00:05:16,740
Now it certainly looks to me like there's more blue and purple in the 2017 map and more

78
00:05:16,740 --> 00:05:21,220
red in the 2008 map, but that's purely subjective.

79
00:05:21,220 --> 00:05:26,660
To Homewood it apparently looks like the opposite, and that's also in the eye of the beholder.

80
00:05:26,660 --> 00:05:31,380
So let's dispense with the art class and look at the science, which has to do with measuring

81
00:05:31,380 --> 00:05:34,280
and numbers and calculations.

82
00:05:34,280 --> 00:05:38,700
We need to know exactly how much area is covered by ice that's five metres thick, how much

83
00:05:38,700 --> 00:05:43,780
covered by ice that's three metres thick and so on according to the DMI model.

84
00:05:43,780 --> 00:05:48,860
And that of course gives us volume, and comparing volume year by year tells us how much of the

85
00:05:48,860 --> 00:05:51,100
ice has melted.

86
00:05:51,100 --> 00:05:55,600
Fortunately not only has the DMI worked out the volume in their model, they've reproduced

87
00:05:55,600 --> 00:05:57,540
their results in the insets.

88
00:05:57,540 --> 00:06:02,120
I don't know if Homewood realised what they were, but they directly contradict what he's

89
00:06:02,120 --> 00:06:03,620
just written.

90
00:06:03,620 --> 00:06:11,220
Ice volume is much lower in 2017, the black line here, than 2008, the black line here.

91
00:06:11,220 --> 00:06:16,940
Now it may be that in some parts of the Arctic ice is thicker in 2017 than 2008 and vice

92
00:06:16,940 --> 00:06:22,900
versa, but what the DMI shows is that not only is ice extent shrinking, but ice volume

93
00:06:22,900 --> 00:06:27,300
is also shrinking, which means there's net melt of sea ice.

94
00:06:27,300 --> 00:06:32,620
And of course that's consistent with global warming.

95
00:06:32,620 --> 00:06:37,100
Disclaim from Booker, the Greenland ice cap last winter increased in volume faster than

96
00:06:37,100 --> 00:06:39,620
at any time for years.

97
00:06:39,620 --> 00:06:44,100
Of course the Greenland ice cap always grows in winter because that's when it's cold and

98
00:06:44,100 --> 00:06:46,980
it melts in summer when it's warm.

99
00:06:46,980 --> 00:06:51,680
Here's the graph from the DMI reproduced by Homewood that shows it.

100
00:06:51,680 --> 00:06:54,520
So the question is, is it growing faster?

101
00:06:54,520 --> 00:06:59,740
In other words is the amount of snow being added every winter increasing?

102
00:06:59,740 --> 00:07:02,940
Well that's an easy one, yes it is.

103
00:07:02,940 --> 00:07:07,540
One of the predictions attached to global warming is that warmer air holds more moisture

104
00:07:07,540 --> 00:07:13,220
and more moisture in the air means more precipitation in areas where rain and snow falls, like the

105
00:07:13,220 --> 00:07:16,060
highlands and interior of Greenland.

106
00:07:16,060 --> 00:07:19,780
So every winter more and more ice is added.

107
00:07:19,780 --> 00:07:23,820
At this point that's all the bloggers and the Daily Telegraph will tell you.

108
00:07:23,820 --> 00:07:28,340
But as the man who inspired me in my radio career, Paul Harvey, used to say...

109
00:07:28,340 --> 00:07:31,020
Now the rest of the story.

110
00:07:31,020 --> 00:07:36,360
The rest of the story is what happens in summer when there's net ice loss.

111
00:07:36,360 --> 00:07:40,940
According to predictions, global warming will cause accelerated ice loss in summer just

112
00:07:40,940 --> 00:07:47,980
as it causes accelerated ice accumulation in winter and that prediction matches observations.

113
00:07:47,980 --> 00:07:53,620
This study published in Nature Climate Change shows ice accumulation in red and ice loss

114
00:07:53,620 --> 00:07:54,620
in blue.

115
00:07:55,140 --> 00:08:00,380
Both are increasing every year but as you can see from the graph, Greenland's ice loss

116
00:08:00,380 --> 00:08:04,620
is increasing faster than ice accumulation.

117
00:08:04,620 --> 00:08:09,220
Now it's possible Homewood didn't read the Nature Climate Change study but he says he

118
00:08:09,220 --> 00:08:15,340
did read the DMI statement and that also says ice loss is greater than ice gain.

119
00:08:15,340 --> 00:08:20,000
I know a lot of people won't believe me so read it for yourselves.

120
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:25,360
The DMI statement says over the year it snows more than it melts but carving of icebergs

121
00:08:25,360 --> 00:08:29,040
also adds to the total mass budget of the ice sheet.

122
00:08:29,040 --> 00:08:34,000
Satellite observations over the last decade show that the ice sheet is not in balance.

123
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:38,540
The carving loss is greater than the gain from surface mass balance and Greenland is

124
00:08:38,540 --> 00:08:42,800
losing mass at about 200 billion tonnes a year.

125
00:08:42,800 --> 00:08:45,800
And it even repeats that further down.

126
00:08:45,800 --> 00:08:50,240
Satellites have observed a loss of around 200 billion tonnes a year.

127
00:08:50,240 --> 00:08:55,080
So it's not as if this wasn't spelled out in the DMI report that Homewood's using as

128
00:08:55,080 --> 00:08:57,880
its source.

129
00:08:57,880 --> 00:09:01,640
Next claim, the satellites now show in recent months global temperatures have plummeted

130
00:09:01,640 --> 00:09:04,240
by more than 0.6 degrees.

131
00:09:04,240 --> 00:09:07,520
Yes and there is the plummeting global temperature.

132
00:09:07,520 --> 00:09:13,320
It plummeted because there was a temperature spike in 2016 caused by El Niño.

133
00:09:13,320 --> 00:09:17,240
There are lots of these temperature spikes and temperature rises and of course they're

134
00:09:17,240 --> 00:09:21,880
followed by temperature falls because temperature doesn't go up in straight lines.

135
00:09:21,880 --> 00:09:27,240
The question is do these ups and downs change the long-term temperature trend?

136
00:09:27,240 --> 00:09:31,440
No of course they don't as a look at any temperature trend shows.

137
00:09:31,440 --> 00:09:34,440
But Booker doesn't even accept the trend.

138
00:09:34,440 --> 00:09:38,760
He writes, this means the global temperature trend has now shown no further warming for

139
00:09:38,760 --> 00:09:40,360
19 years.

140
00:09:40,400 --> 00:09:45,760
Yeah I hear this a lot and we've had claims of no temperature rise for 15 or 20 or 19

141
00:09:45,760 --> 00:09:51,920
or 18 or 17 years and yet all the temperature measurements show clearly that there has been

142
00:09:51,920 --> 00:09:52,920
warming.

143
00:09:52,920 --> 00:09:58,080
So in the space of three short paragraphs that's six claims out of six battered out

144
00:09:58,080 --> 00:09:59,840
of the ballpark.

145
00:09:59,840 --> 00:10:03,120
And if you don't agree, well the DMI report is right there.

146
00:10:03,120 --> 00:10:07,880
I've given a link to it in the video description so you can read it for yourselves.

147
00:10:07,880 --> 00:10:10,960
The thing is you don't need to be a genius to do this.

148
00:10:10,960 --> 00:10:16,920
I came bottom of my class but even I can click on a link and compare the claim with the source.

149
00:10:16,920 --> 00:10:21,480
A lot of people tell me they've started doing that now and it clears up a lot of confusion

150
00:10:21,480 --> 00:10:24,360
about what to believe on the internet.

151
00:10:24,360 --> 00:10:28,920
The only thing the bloggers got right is that for a lot of people this accelerated melting

152
00:10:28,920 --> 00:10:32,280
of the Greenland ice sheet is their worst nightmare.

153
00:10:32,280 --> 00:10:36,800
It's what scientists were warning about as far back as the 1950s and now it's happening

154
00:10:36,800 --> 00:10:38,300
for real.

155
00:10:38,300 --> 00:10:41,640
You can say you don't care or you can say you're happy about it.

156
00:10:41,640 --> 00:10:43,080
That's up to you.

157
00:10:43,080 --> 00:10:48,000
But what you can't do is cherry pick or change the conclusion of a scientific study that

158
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:52,240
says it is happening in order to support your belief that it's not.
