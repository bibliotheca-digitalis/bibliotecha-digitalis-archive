00:00.000 --> 00:04.520
I always know when a new claim is doing the rounds of the blogosphere, because comments

00:04.520 --> 00:09.520
start appearing on my channel from people who unquestioningly believe them.

00:09.520 --> 00:13.840
So I began to suspect something was up when a couple of people claimed the Greenland ice

00:13.840 --> 00:19.840
sheet was growing. A quick search on Google, and yes, here they are.

00:19.840 --> 00:24.200
Greenland ice mass balance increasing, says a blog called Ice Age Now.

00:24.200 --> 00:29.960
New study shows global warming non-existent for nearly two decades, says the Constitution.

00:29.960 --> 00:34.800
A new study could prove to be the globalists' worst nightmare, says the blog What Did You

00:34.800 --> 00:37.480
Say? I thought the worst nightmare was a banana.

00:37.480 --> 00:41.680
Behold the atheists' nightmare.

00:41.680 --> 00:47.080
And this is the study in question, or at least a summary of it by the Danish Meteorological

00:47.080 --> 00:49.320
Institute on its website.

00:49.320 --> 00:53.920
Now it's unlikely all these bloggers read the DMI website and made exactly the same

00:53.920 --> 00:59.160
mistake, so as always we have to track back to find out where the original infestation

00:59.160 --> 01:02.360
– I mean error – started.

01:02.360 --> 01:07.240
So let's start with this blog, the Constitution, which says it's defending the Union from

01:07.240 --> 01:10.920
threats foreign and domestic, which is nice.

01:10.920 --> 01:16.040
It says the culmination of decades of exhausting unbiased work in the field of global climate

01:16.040 --> 01:21.280
science has now gifted us with one of the clearest pictures of our planet's true environmental

01:21.280 --> 01:25.860
situation, and the globalists are not going to be happy.

01:25.860 --> 01:31.280
It then quotes The Daily Wire quoting The Daily Telegraph, which it turns out is quoting

01:31.280 --> 01:34.820
another blog called Not a Lot of People Know That.

01:34.820 --> 01:38.900
And Not a Lot of People Know That claims to have got its information from a computer model

01:38.900 --> 01:43.300
by the Danish Meteorological Institute, the DMI.

01:43.300 --> 01:48.040
But the bloggers are all so busy copying and quoting from one another that nobody seems

01:48.040 --> 01:54.260
to have thought to check the information from the DMI to see if it's been accurately reported.

01:54.260 --> 01:58.300
So a warning to those who believe the bloggers – switch off now unless you want to see

01:58.300 --> 02:01.740
the actual report to find out what it really says.

02:01.740 --> 02:06.260
Let's start with the Telegraph article that most bloggers were copying from by Christopher

02:06.260 --> 02:07.460
Booker.

02:07.460 --> 02:12.440
He makes six claims altogether in the space of just three paragraphs, so let's see how

02:12.440 --> 02:14.780
many can be battered out of the ballpark.

02:14.780 --> 02:17.980
We'll start with the first one.

02:17.980 --> 02:22.600
Booker writes, Last week we were brought back to Earth by the Danish Meteorological Institute

02:22.600 --> 02:27.760
– DMI – as chartered by our friend Paul Homewood on his blog Not a Lot of People Know

02:27.760 --> 02:32.480
That, with the news that ever since December, temperatures in the Arctic have consistently

02:32.480 --> 02:35.960
been lower than minus 20.

02:35.960 --> 02:40.880
I don't know if that's surprisingly cold for the Arctic in winter, and Booker doesn't

02:40.880 --> 02:41.880
say.

02:41.880 --> 02:44.880
So let's go to his source, Paul Homewood.

02:44.880 --> 02:50.080
What Homewood actually says is that temperatures have been minus 20 degrees C or more all years

02:50.080 --> 02:51.080
so far.

02:51.080 --> 02:56.720
That's from January 1st up till May 2nd 2017, and that temperatures are currently

02:56.720 --> 02:58.720
below average.

02:58.720 --> 03:03.540
And Homewood reproduces a graph from the DMI website to confirm this.

03:03.540 --> 03:05.560
And sure enough, he's right.

03:05.560 --> 03:09.860
Around the beginning of May, the temperatures, which is the red line, were below average

03:09.860 --> 03:11.800
– that's the green line.

03:11.800 --> 03:16.360
I'm sorry the graph is a bit fuzzy, but I've had to zoom in to capture the two or

03:16.360 --> 03:20.920
three days of the year when the temperatures were below average.

03:20.920 --> 03:25.840
If we zoom out and look at the whole graph, we can see that for the rest of the year,

03:25.840 --> 03:28.280
temperatures were well above average.

03:28.280 --> 03:32.320
This is what's known as cherry-picking, and it's the first ball to be batted out

03:32.320 --> 03:35.120
of the ballpark.

03:35.120 --> 03:38.580
Let's move on to the next claim by Christopher Booker.

03:38.580 --> 03:42.520
He writes, in April, the extent of Arctic sea ice was back to where it was in April

03:42.520 --> 03:46.500
13 years ago, again quoting Paul Homewood.

03:46.500 --> 03:49.760
And again, that's not quite what Homewood wrote.

03:49.760 --> 03:56.720
What he actually said was that average April ice extent has now been stable since 2004.

03:56.720 --> 03:57.720
Has it?

03:57.720 --> 04:01.960
Well, just below that claim, he shows a graph that seems to confirm it.

04:01.960 --> 04:05.320
But why April, and why 2004?

04:05.320 --> 04:11.880
Well, because a lot of ice was lost in 2004, so it's a good year for his starting point.

04:11.880 --> 04:16.820
And if Homewood had chosen June or July or August or September or October or November

04:16.820 --> 04:22.980
or December of that year, then sea ice extent would have been much bigger in 2004, and that's

04:22.980 --> 04:25.220
not what he wants us to hear.

04:25.220 --> 04:30.060
So he was very particular about which month and which year to cherry-pick.

04:30.060 --> 04:35.460
But even choosing April 2004 doesn't disguise the downward trend line, as the graph from

04:35.460 --> 04:37.800
the DMI clearly shows.

04:37.800 --> 04:42.980
And if we take a look at annual Arctic sea ice extent, the decline over the last 35 years

04:42.980 --> 04:49.860
is obvious even to those who prefer to cherry-pick their months.

04:49.860 --> 04:50.940
Claim number three.

04:50.940 --> 04:56.060
Whereas in 2008 most of the ice was extremely thin, this year most has been at least two

04:56.060 --> 04:58.020
metres thick.

04:58.020 --> 05:02.700
Homewood tries to support this claim with two maps from the DMI model showing ice thickness

05:02.700 --> 05:06.900
for May 2008 and May 2017.

05:06.900 --> 05:11.460
The reds represent thicker ice, the blues and purples thinner.

05:11.460 --> 05:16.740
Now it certainly looks to me like there's more blue and purple in the 2017 map and more

05:16.740 --> 05:21.220
red in the 2008 map, but that's purely subjective.

05:21.220 --> 05:26.660
To Homewood it apparently looks like the opposite, and that's also in the eye of the beholder.

05:26.660 --> 05:31.380
So let's dispense with the art class and look at the science, which has to do with measuring

05:31.380 --> 05:34.280
and numbers and calculations.

05:34.280 --> 05:38.700
We need to know exactly how much area is covered by ice that's five metres thick, how much

05:38.700 --> 05:43.780
covered by ice that's three metres thick and so on according to the DMI model.

05:43.780 --> 05:48.860
And that of course gives us volume, and comparing volume year by year tells us how much of the

05:48.860 --> 05:51.100
ice has melted.

05:51.100 --> 05:55.600
Fortunately not only has the DMI worked out the volume in their model, they've reproduced

05:55.600 --> 05:57.540
their results in the insets.

05:57.540 --> 06:02.120
I don't know if Homewood realised what they were, but they directly contradict what he's

06:02.120 --> 06:03.620
just written.

06:03.620 --> 06:11.220
Ice volume is much lower in 2017, the black line here, than 2008, the black line here.

06:11.220 --> 06:16.940
Now it may be that in some parts of the Arctic ice is thicker in 2017 than 2008 and vice

06:16.940 --> 06:22.900
versa, but what the DMI shows is that not only is ice extent shrinking, but ice volume

06:22.900 --> 06:27.300
is also shrinking, which means there's net melt of sea ice.

06:27.300 --> 06:32.620
And of course that's consistent with global warming.

06:32.620 --> 06:37.100
Disclaim from Booker, the Greenland ice cap last winter increased in volume faster than

06:37.100 --> 06:39.620
at any time for years.

06:39.620 --> 06:44.100
Of course the Greenland ice cap always grows in winter because that's when it's cold and

06:44.100 --> 06:46.980
it melts in summer when it's warm.

06:46.980 --> 06:51.680
Here's the graph from the DMI reproduced by Homewood that shows it.

06:51.680 --> 06:54.520
So the question is, is it growing faster?

06:54.520 --> 06:59.740
In other words is the amount of snow being added every winter increasing?

06:59.740 --> 07:02.940
Well that's an easy one, yes it is.

07:02.940 --> 07:07.540
One of the predictions attached to global warming is that warmer air holds more moisture

07:07.540 --> 07:13.220
and more moisture in the air means more precipitation in areas where rain and snow falls, like the

07:13.220 --> 07:16.060
highlands and interior of Greenland.

07:16.060 --> 07:19.780
So every winter more and more ice is added.

07:19.780 --> 07:23.820
At this point that's all the bloggers and the Daily Telegraph will tell you.

07:23.820 --> 07:28.340
But as the man who inspired me in my radio career, Paul Harvey, used to say...

07:28.340 --> 07:31.020
Now the rest of the story.

07:31.020 --> 07:36.360
The rest of the story is what happens in summer when there's net ice loss.

07:36.360 --> 07:40.940
According to predictions, global warming will cause accelerated ice loss in summer just

07:40.940 --> 07:47.980
as it causes accelerated ice accumulation in winter and that prediction matches observations.

07:47.980 --> 07:53.620
This study published in Nature Climate Change shows ice accumulation in red and ice loss

07:53.620 --> 07:54.620
in blue.

07:55.140 --> 08:00.380
Both are increasing every year but as you can see from the graph, Greenland's ice loss

08:00.380 --> 08:04.620
is increasing faster than ice accumulation.

08:04.620 --> 08:09.220
Now it's possible Homewood didn't read the Nature Climate Change study but he says he

08:09.220 --> 08:15.340
did read the DMI statement and that also says ice loss is greater than ice gain.

08:15.340 --> 08:20.000
I know a lot of people won't believe me so read it for yourselves.

08:20.000 --> 08:25.360
The DMI statement says over the year it snows more than it melts but carving of icebergs

08:25.360 --> 08:29.040
also adds to the total mass budget of the ice sheet.

08:29.040 --> 08:34.000
Satellite observations over the last decade show that the ice sheet is not in balance.

08:34.000 --> 08:38.540
The carving loss is greater than the gain from surface mass balance and Greenland is

08:38.540 --> 08:42.800
losing mass at about 200 billion tonnes a year.

08:42.800 --> 08:45.800
And it even repeats that further down.

08:45.800 --> 08:50.240
Satellites have observed a loss of around 200 billion tonnes a year.

08:50.240 --> 08:55.080
So it's not as if this wasn't spelled out in the DMI report that Homewood's using as

08:55.080 --> 08:57.880
its source.

08:57.880 --> 09:01.640
Next claim, the satellites now show in recent months global temperatures have plummeted

09:01.640 --> 09:04.240
by more than 0.6 degrees.

09:04.240 --> 09:07.520
Yes and there is the plummeting global temperature.

09:07.520 --> 09:13.320
It plummeted because there was a temperature spike in 2016 caused by El Niño.

09:13.320 --> 09:17.240
There are lots of these temperature spikes and temperature rises and of course they're

09:17.240 --> 09:21.880
followed by temperature falls because temperature doesn't go up in straight lines.

09:21.880 --> 09:27.240
The question is do these ups and downs change the long-term temperature trend?

09:27.240 --> 09:31.440
No of course they don't as a look at any temperature trend shows.

09:31.440 --> 09:34.440
But Booker doesn't even accept the trend.

09:34.440 --> 09:38.760
He writes, this means the global temperature trend has now shown no further warming for

09:38.760 --> 09:40.360
19 years.

09:40.400 --> 09:45.760
Yeah I hear this a lot and we've had claims of no temperature rise for 15 or 20 or 19

09:45.760 --> 09:51.920
or 18 or 17 years and yet all the temperature measurements show clearly that there has been

09:51.920 --> 09:52.920
warming.

09:52.920 --> 09:58.080
So in the space of three short paragraphs that's six claims out of six battered out

09:58.080 --> 09:59.840
of the ballpark.

09:59.840 --> 10:03.120
And if you don't agree, well the DMI report is right there.

10:03.120 --> 10:07.880
I've given a link to it in the video description so you can read it for yourselves.

10:07.880 --> 10:10.960
The thing is you don't need to be a genius to do this.

10:10.960 --> 10:16.920
I came bottom of my class but even I can click on a link and compare the claim with the source.

10:16.920 --> 10:21.480
A lot of people tell me they've started doing that now and it clears up a lot of confusion

10:21.480 --> 10:24.360
about what to believe on the internet.

10:24.360 --> 10:28.920
The only thing the bloggers got right is that for a lot of people this accelerated melting

10:28.920 --> 10:32.280
of the Greenland ice sheet is their worst nightmare.

10:32.280 --> 10:36.800
It's what scientists were warning about as far back as the 1950s and now it's happening

10:36.800 --> 10:38.300
for real.

10:38.300 --> 10:41.640
You can say you don't care or you can say you're happy about it.

10:41.640 --> 10:43.080
That's up to you.

10:43.080 --> 10:48.000
But what you can't do is cherry pick or change the conclusion of a scientific study that

10:48.000 --> 10:52.240
says it is happening in order to support your belief that it's not.
