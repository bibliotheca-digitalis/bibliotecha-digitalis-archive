1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,080
What you do need to take into account here is that people base their lives on your projections

2
00:00:06,080 --> 00:00:11,520
and it turned out that none of it was true. You painted a doomsday climate change scenario,

3
00:00:11,520 --> 00:00:15,440
farmers, city planners, taxpayers, they believe, none of it was correct. So you can't just

4
00:00:15,440 --> 00:00:18,640
admonish them now. You can't just look down your nose at them now and say, well, I can't,

5
00:00:18,640 --> 00:00:22,000
why wouldn't you, why wouldn't you believe us, you silly bumpkin? Well, because of you.

6
00:00:22,880 --> 00:00:25,760
I don't believe you. You lied last time. You don't believe science?

7
00:00:26,640 --> 00:00:31,680
What's got Steven Crowder and his friends worked up is a projection about water levels in the

8
00:00:31,680 --> 00:00:37,040
Great Lakes, just one of many forecasts related to the consequences of climate change.

9
00:00:37,760 --> 00:00:42,080
You might be forgiven for thinking he's attacking researchers for getting their projections wrong.

10
00:00:42,720 --> 00:00:46,240
In fact, he was citing this prediction by a politician.

11
00:00:46,240 --> 00:00:50,400
What we're seeing in global warming is the evaporation of our Great Lakes.

12
00:00:51,360 --> 00:00:52,800
It's a scary thing.

13
00:00:52,800 --> 00:00:54,880
And this prediction from a news article.

14
00:00:55,440 --> 00:00:59,200
And here we have an article from USA Today. I remember this article. I think it was in 2012,

15
00:00:59,200 --> 00:01:03,840
2013. They said it would take decades of rain, decades of rain, heavy, heavy rain,

16
00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:08,960
just to return to normal. OK, it took two years. Actually, the article didn't say anything of the

17
00:01:08,960 --> 00:01:14,960
sort. I tracked it down where it talked about the restoration of lake levels. It wasn't quoting

18
00:01:14,960 --> 00:01:20,640
a scientific study. It was quoting a retired hydrologist who said it would take years of

19
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:27,760
consistent rain to return Lake Michigan and Lake Huron to normal. So, no, not decades of rain.

20
00:01:28,640 --> 00:01:34,080
But Crowder was spot on with his criticism of the politician. Now, Senator Durbin's right in

21
00:01:34,080 --> 00:01:39,600
saying we get evaporation from the Great Lakes. And according to scientific research, that's been

22
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:45,840
increasing because of higher water temperatures and diminished ice cover. But he either didn't

23
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:52,160
know or didn't mention that this evaporation is offset by water coming in from the catchment area.

24
00:01:52,160 --> 00:01:57,360
When you say levels will undeniably, undoubtedly continue to descend to record low levels due to

25
00:01:57,360 --> 00:02:02,080
climate change and exclusively climate change, they have to plan their seasons for things like

26
00:02:02,080 --> 00:02:07,200
more erosion, less underpass room for waterway bridges. They have to plan extensive dredging of

27
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:10,160
harbors. City engineering comes into play, not to mention the private businesses. They have to

28
00:02:10,160 --> 00:02:14,800
adjust their business models based on your projections of shorefront. Crowder did say in

29
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:20,480
the video that he wasn't going to look at the science, but perhaps he should. Because business

30
00:02:20,480 --> 00:02:27,120
managers, town planners and farmers don't base their lives or future plans on a claim by a senator.

31
00:02:27,760 --> 00:02:31,840
They plan based on properly conducted peer-reviewed scientific research.

32
00:02:32,640 --> 00:02:39,280
So what does the science say? Far from predicting scary evaporation, the 2007

33
00:02:39,280 --> 00:02:44,160
International Upper Great Lakes study found that future lake levels would remain within the

34
00:02:44,160 --> 00:02:49,840
historical range. The most recent long-term projections by the US Army Corps of Engineers,

35
00:02:49,840 --> 00:02:55,440
which is responsible for monitoring the Great Lakes, only looks ahead five years. But their

36
00:02:55,440 --> 00:03:01,200
conclusion was that during that time, water levels would vary more, but with an average higher than

37
00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:06,880
the historical range. Where are we now? Lake Superior is already near record high levels.

38
00:03:06,880 --> 00:03:11,280
By May could reach a record that was set in the mid 1980s. Lake Erie could reach record highs

39
00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:15,840
later this spring. Lake Michigan and Huron also expected to be much higher, much, much higher

40
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:22,080
than historically normal levels. It only took a few years to get to significantly higher than

41
00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:26,480
normal levels. And I remember this because I was in Michigan. Fair enough, Stephen, but why didn't

42
00:03:26,480 --> 00:03:32,960
you tell your listeners that this is exactly what scientific studies had predicted? Anyway, this

43
00:03:32,960 --> 00:03:37,920
video isn't about the Great Lakes or Stephen Crowder. It just so happened he released a video

44
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:43,200
rubbishing climate predictions at the same time I was researching this video about climate

45
00:03:43,200 --> 00:03:50,000
predictions, so it made a very good point. People often misrepresent the science, but that's not an

46
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:56,480
exclusively left-wing or a right-wing phenomenon. It's done by politicians, op-ed writers, lobbyists

47
00:03:56,480 --> 00:04:02,800
and bloggers on both sides of the political spectrum. But through all this misrepresentation

48
00:04:02,800 --> 00:04:08,880
and political squabbling, an important fact has been overlooked. That scientific studies in this

49
00:04:08,880 --> 00:04:14,160
field have a very good track record in getting their projections right, just as they did with

50
00:04:14,160 --> 00:04:20,240
the Great Lakes. And if you're already gasping in disbelief at that, it probably means you've

51
00:04:20,240 --> 00:04:25,920
been spending way too much time listening to bloggers and political pundits. The same goes

52
00:04:25,920 --> 00:04:31,520
for this popular list of supposedly failed scientific conclusions from Fox News, copied

53
00:04:31,520 --> 00:04:37,840
by this vlogger and many others. Here now are the top 10 global warming predictions

54
00:04:37,840 --> 00:04:44,480
gotten wrong. Number 10 from the UK came this prediction. Within a few years, a scientist said,

55
00:04:44,480 --> 00:04:50,400
children just aren't going to know what snow is. Snowfall will be very rare. That, according to

56
00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:58,400
Dr David Vinner, senior research scientist at the Climate Research Unit, CRU, East Anglia.

57
00:04:58,400 --> 00:05:04,400
Yes, and I've debunked this claim myself. It's not based on any scientific study. It comes from

58
00:05:04,400 --> 00:05:09,840
a newspaper interview and it's nonsense. Of course, a lot of people will be saying,

59
00:05:09,840 --> 00:05:15,280
but he's a scientist. Surely anything scientists say must be based on scientific research.

60
00:05:15,840 --> 00:05:20,160
Well, if you've watched my channel, you'll know that scientists spout all sorts of crap when

61
00:05:20,160 --> 00:05:25,760
they're not confined to the rigorous demands of scientific publishing. The reason we have

62
00:05:25,840 --> 00:05:31,600
peer-reviewed scientific publishing is to ensure that conclusions are supported by evidence.

63
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:36,640
Calculations and analyses have to be done strictly according to the scientific method.

64
00:05:37,200 --> 00:05:42,240
That's why, to use Steven Crowder's yardstick, planners, farmers and business people

65
00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:48,320
base their lives and futures on properly published science, not random statements in newspapers and

66
00:05:48,320 --> 00:05:55,520
on TV. Dr Viner didn't cite a study that supported his claim and the independent newspaper didn't ask

67
00:05:55,520 --> 00:06:01,600
for one. But I did, and here's the lame response I got from the organisation Viner worked for.

68
00:06:02,480 --> 00:06:07,040
In other words, the answer is no. There's no scientific study supporting his claim.

69
00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:13,760
Bloggers have tried to cite other predictions of no more snow. Most, like Viner's, are completely

70
00:06:13,760 --> 00:06:20,320
unsupported by scientific studies. But this one supposedly comes from the IPCC, and the allegation

71
00:06:20,320 --> 00:06:25,280
that the prediction failed has been mindlessly copied by other bloggers who never bothered to

72
00:06:25,280 --> 00:06:31,360
check it. Here's the statement from the IPCC report they quote. In the North America section,

73
00:06:31,360 --> 00:06:36,960
bottom paragraph here, it says milder winter temperatures will decrease heavy snowstorms,

74
00:06:36,960 --> 00:06:42,320
but could cause an increase in freezing rain. The section a bit further down that the bloggers

75
00:06:42,320 --> 00:06:48,960
never cite is this prediction. Fewer periods of extreme cold, fewer snowstorms, although there

76
00:06:48,960 --> 00:06:54,560
may be an increase in the number of intense storms. This blogger claims the prediction is

77
00:06:54,560 --> 00:07:01,040
wrong because the northern hemisphere's snow area shows remarkably little change since 1967.

78
00:07:01,040 --> 00:07:05,280
But the prediction wasn't for the northern hemisphere, it was for North America.

79
00:07:05,840 --> 00:07:11,280
It wasn't a prediction about snow area, but about snow storms. There was no mention of a

80
00:07:11,280 --> 00:07:18,240
start point in 1967, and no mention of an end point in 2017. It's no good debunking

81
00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:22,720
a prediction if your yardstick is something completely different to that of the prediction.

82
00:07:23,920 --> 00:07:28,000
Of course, if you're living in a part of the USA affected by those snowstorms,

83
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:33,120
it won't look as though the continent is getting milder, but remember that there are other places

84
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:40,000
in North America besides where you live. Even a year before the independent story came out,

85
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:45,920
another scientific study was also predicting more intense snowstorms. According to the researchers'

86
00:07:45,920 --> 00:07:51,920
model, as ice melts in the Arctic, it'll create a high pressure zone moving cold air further south

87
00:07:51,920 --> 00:07:57,440
in winter. And because of a weakened jet stream, another consequence of global warming that I

88
00:07:57,440 --> 00:08:03,040
explained in my video on hurricanes, this cold air will no longer be contained within the Arctic

89
00:08:03,040 --> 00:08:08,480
circle. It'll spill out, bringing Arctic weather conditions to Europe and North America.

90
00:08:09,280 --> 00:08:15,600
The prediction of colder Arctic air moving south was so accurate that a projected meteorological

91
00:08:15,600 --> 00:08:22,160
pattern from Petakov and Semenov's 2010 paper looks almost identical to a mass of Arctic air

92
00:08:22,160 --> 00:08:27,600
that swept Europe a few years later, and a similar pattern has now hit the United States several

93
00:08:27,600 --> 00:08:33,760
years running. The red areas are where temperatures are well above normal, the blue areas are where

94
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:39,920
it's well below normal. It looks as though the Arctic is warming so fast that freezing air is

95
00:08:39,920 --> 00:08:46,160
being pushed out further south, and essentially that's what's happening. So when it comes to an

96
00:08:46,160 --> 00:08:51,760
end to snow, the newspaper may have got it wrong, but the scientific predictions, the ones backed

97
00:08:51,760 --> 00:08:57,520
by peer-reviewed scientific research, were unfortunately all too accurate. Number nine,

98
00:08:57,600 --> 00:09:04,640
by 1995 the greenhouse effect will be desolating the hard land of North America and Eurasia with

99
00:09:04,640 --> 00:09:13,040
horrific drought causing crop failures and riots. By 1996 the Platte River of Nebraska will be dry,

100
00:09:13,600 --> 00:09:19,680
that according to Michael Oppenheimer. But according to Fox News, which compiled the list,

101
00:09:19,680 --> 00:09:25,920
this claim came from a book, not a scientific study. So again we have to find out what the

102
00:09:25,920 --> 00:09:31,840
science says. NOAA, which made a study of the midwest, looked at the trend over the next 90

103
00:09:31,840 --> 00:09:37,920
years based on a number of different scenarios, and the Met Office looked ahead to the year 2100.

104
00:09:38,480 --> 00:09:42,800
Both predicted that the midwest would get drier and hotter over the next century,

105
00:09:43,360 --> 00:09:49,440
but no scientific study predicted that climate change would look like this in midwestern states

106
00:09:49,440 --> 00:09:57,840
by 1995 or 1996. Number eight, arctic specialist Brent Belkom says a general warming trend over

107
00:09:57,840 --> 00:10:04,640
the north pole is melting the polar ice cap and may produce an ice-free arctic ocean by the year

108
00:10:04,640 --> 00:10:12,720
2000. Arctic specialist? Well he was a Norwegian aviator in the 1930s who flew a lot in the arctic,

109
00:10:12,720 --> 00:10:17,440
but no prizes for guessing that he never wrote a scientific study on future melting,

110
00:10:17,440 --> 00:10:23,760
he was simply giving his opinion to a newspaper. Predictions about the arctic also pop up regularly

111
00:10:23,760 --> 00:10:30,960
in my channel fora, but all too often the experts in their field turn out to be Al Gore, who's not

112
00:10:30,960 --> 00:10:36,720
an expert and hasn't published a study on arctic ice. Al Gore's claim is based on something a

113
00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:43,600
researcher called Wieslaw Maslowski said at a meeting of the American Geophysical Union in 2007,

114
00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:47,280
that the arctic might be ice-free during the summer within five years.

115
00:10:48,320 --> 00:10:53,920
Nearly all the peer-reviewed studies at the time were predicting an ice-free summer arctic decades

116
00:10:53,920 --> 00:11:00,160
ahead, around 2070. In fact, later measurements showed that the arctic is melting much faster

117
00:11:00,160 --> 00:11:06,000
than predicted, so most recent studies have brought the date forward, closer to the range of between

118
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:27,840
2040 and 2060. According to Fox News, which compiled the list, AP got this from a study by

119
00:11:27,840 --> 00:11:33,440
the Atmospheric and Environmental Research Inc, but it doesn't say where the study was published

120
00:11:33,440 --> 00:11:38,480
or from when this temperature rise is supposed to be measured or what the margin of error is.

121
00:11:38,480 --> 00:11:42,320
It's impossible to compare this prediction if we don't know what it was predicting.

122
00:11:43,520 --> 00:11:48,720
In its rebuttal, Fox News cites global temperatures, but the study itself supposedly

123
00:11:48,720 --> 00:11:54,240
cited nationwide temperatures. But if Fox News wants to look at global temperatures, there's a

124
00:11:54,240 --> 00:11:59,760
much more famous prediction from that time that does that, and one that bloggers frequently cite

125
00:11:59,760 --> 00:12:06,640
as a failure. In 1988, James Hansen looked at forcing bicarbon dioxide based on three possible

126
00:12:06,640 --> 00:12:11,600
scenarios, depending on what governments and industry decided to do in the next few decades.

127
00:12:12,560 --> 00:12:18,320
Scenario A showed what would happen to temperatures if no action was taken to curb CO2 emissions

128
00:12:18,320 --> 00:12:25,200
and there was exponential growth. In other words, the growth in CO2 concentration accelerated.

129
00:12:25,200 --> 00:12:30,560
Scenario B showed temperatures assuming some action was taken to curb CO2 emissions

130
00:12:30,560 --> 00:12:36,080
and there was a linear rate of growth. And Scenario C showed temperatures assuming cuts

131
00:12:36,080 --> 00:12:41,440
in CO2 emissions. As it turned out, action was taken to curb CO2 emissions,

132
00:12:41,440 --> 00:12:48,000
thanks in large part to the Kyoto Protocol. So Scenario A was avoided. What the world ended up

133
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:54,640
with was linear growth, Scenario B. This is what Hansen predicted would be the temperature rise,

134
00:12:54,640 --> 00:12:58,400
30 years on, how does that compare with the actual temperature rise?

135
00:13:00,160 --> 00:13:06,240
Pretty much spot on. Hansen used a climate sensitivity of 4.2 degrees centigrade for

136
00:13:06,240 --> 00:13:10,320
his projection, whereas more recent research shows the sensitivity

137
00:13:10,320 --> 00:13:16,560
closer to 3 degrees centigrade. If 3 degrees is used, the projection is even more accurate.

138
00:13:17,360 --> 00:13:20,960
Now of course, people who spend all their time in chat rooms and blogs

139
00:13:20,960 --> 00:13:26,880
hearing the mantra that the models are wrong are not going to accept this. I get it. You've

140
00:13:26,880 --> 00:13:31,280
seen graphs that show something completely different. So where did those come from?

141
00:13:31,920 --> 00:13:37,920
In 1998, a climatologist called Patrick Michaels told a House of Representatives committee that

142
00:13:37,920 --> 00:13:42,480
actual temperature measurements had failed to follow the projection made by Hansen 10 years

143
00:13:42,480 --> 00:13:48,800
earlier. As evidence, he showed Hansen's three different scenarios and compared them to actual

144
00:13:48,800 --> 00:13:55,360
temperatures. At least that's what he should have done. What he actually did was airbrush out the

145
00:13:55,360 --> 00:14:00,640
scenario that followed the real rise in CO2 concentration, and only showed the projected

146
00:14:00,640 --> 00:14:06,560
temperature rise caused by accelerating CO2 emissions, a scenario that never happened.

147
00:14:07,440 --> 00:14:13,200
It's hard to dismiss this as a mistake, because Michaels is a qualified research climatologist

148
00:14:13,200 --> 00:14:18,320
and understands how projections work, and he knew what the measured rise in CO2 was.

149
00:14:18,880 --> 00:14:22,400
But I should mention that he was no longer a research climatologist

150
00:14:22,400 --> 00:14:26,720
when he testified. Four years earlier, he'd started a lobbying company,

151
00:14:27,280 --> 00:14:31,760
sorry, an advocacy company, called New Hope Environmental Services.

152
00:14:32,560 --> 00:14:36,720
I can't tell you who funds him. I'll let Patrick Michaels tell you himself.

153
00:14:36,720 --> 00:14:38,560
What I'm saying is that...

154
00:14:38,560 --> 00:14:40,320
Is your research funded by these industries?

155
00:14:40,320 --> 00:14:43,760
Not largely. The fact of the matter is...

156
00:14:43,760 --> 00:14:47,760
Can I ask you what percentage of your work is funded by the petroleum industry?

157
00:14:47,760 --> 00:14:50,160
I don't know. 40%? I don't know.

158
00:14:50,160 --> 00:14:53,760
There's nothing wrong with being an advocate for oil industry interests,

159
00:14:53,760 --> 00:14:59,920
and that shouldn't matter or make any difference, as long as his testimony to Congress in 1998

160
00:14:59,920 --> 00:15:04,000
was scientifically accurate. Unfortunately, it wasn't.

161
00:15:04,800 --> 00:15:08,560
In fact, it was so misleading that it caused a senior spokesperson for the

162
00:15:08,560 --> 00:15:13,360
libertarian Cato Institute to change his mind when he discovered the deception.

163
00:15:14,080 --> 00:15:18,800
The Cato Institute is a political organization also lobbying against climate change.

164
00:15:19,360 --> 00:15:23,200
Patrick Michaels and Jerry Taylor were their most prominent spokesmen.

165
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:28,000
Not being a scientist, Taylor simply repeated Michael's claims

166
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:30,160
that Hansen's forecasts were way off.

167
00:15:30,960 --> 00:15:35,360
After one particular TV interview where he gave the usual talking points,

168
00:15:35,360 --> 00:15:37,040
he describes what happened next.

169
00:15:37,600 --> 00:15:42,000
After we got done with the programme and were back in the green room getting the make-up off,

170
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:43,200
Joe said to me,

171
00:15:43,200 --> 00:15:45,840
Did you even read that testimony you've just talked about?

172
00:15:46,400 --> 00:15:48,960
And when I told him it had been a while, he said,

173
00:15:48,960 --> 00:15:51,280
I'm daring you to go back and double-check this.

174
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:55,120
He told me that some of Hansen's projections were spot on.

175
00:15:55,920 --> 00:16:01,120
So I went back to my office and I re-read Hansen's testimony, and Joe was correct.

176
00:16:01,760 --> 00:16:05,840
So then I talked to the climate skeptics who had made this argument to me,

177
00:16:05,840 --> 00:16:10,160
and it turns out they'd done so with full knowledge that they were being misleading.

178
00:16:11,120 --> 00:16:14,560
Taylor, by the way, is still with the Cato Institute,

179
00:16:14,560 --> 00:16:18,000
and he still advocates for his libertarian political views.

180
00:16:18,640 --> 00:16:21,760
But he does so without having to misrepresent the science.

181
00:16:22,400 --> 00:16:27,760
But Michaels is still running his company and still trying to discredit Hansen's prediction.

182
00:16:27,760 --> 00:16:32,160
In this recent Wall Street Journal op-ed, he does show Scenario B,

183
00:16:32,160 --> 00:16:37,200
but he's come up with a new airbrushing technique for pretending the temperatures don't match it,

184
00:16:37,200 --> 00:16:39,200
as explained in the accompanying text.

185
00:16:39,840 --> 00:16:44,160
Global surface temperature has not increased significantly since 2000,

186
00:16:44,160 --> 00:16:48,400
discounting the larger-than-usual El Niño of 2015-16.

187
00:16:49,120 --> 00:16:52,400
Well, that's a novel approach to getting the answer you want.

188
00:16:52,400 --> 00:16:57,040
But El Niño is an integral part of the temperature pattern, as is La Niña.

189
00:16:57,680 --> 00:17:02,480
Shown in blue here, La Niña is a period when the oceans suck in heat from the atmosphere,

190
00:17:02,480 --> 00:17:05,920
and El Niño is a period when that heat is expelled.

191
00:17:05,920 --> 00:17:10,240
If we go to the time period in question and look at the far right of the picture,

192
00:17:10,240 --> 00:17:14,560
what Michaels has done is simply airbrush out the most recent El Niño

193
00:17:14,560 --> 00:17:18,480
in order to make atmospheric temperatures look lower than they really are.

194
00:17:18,480 --> 00:17:20,320
Now you see it, now you don't.

195
00:17:21,040 --> 00:17:26,320
Of course, the most ardent conspiracy theorists will claim that the data showing temperature rise

196
00:17:26,320 --> 00:17:30,960
and ice melt and glacier retreat and warming oceans are all fake,

197
00:17:30,960 --> 00:17:35,040
and that geologists, oceanographers, climatologists, glaciologists,

198
00:17:35,040 --> 00:17:39,440
journal editors and analysts of different nationalities in different countries

199
00:17:39,440 --> 00:17:42,800
are all in on a huge worldwide conspiracy.

200
00:17:42,800 --> 00:17:47,680
But even Patrick Michaels, Roy Spencer and other critics don't dispute the data.

201
00:17:48,320 --> 00:17:51,680
If that's what they thought, they'd simply show the evidence for that,

202
00:17:51,680 --> 00:17:53,920
rather than resort to all this airbrushing.

203
00:17:54,960 --> 00:17:57,440
So how have the predictions of the critics been doing?

204
00:17:58,080 --> 00:18:02,640
A few researchers thought other factors were a bigger forcing than carbon dioxide

205
00:18:02,640 --> 00:18:04,400
and predicted that the Earth would cool.

206
00:18:05,280 --> 00:18:09,440
Don Easterbrook predicted that a Pacific Ocean cycle known as the PDO

207
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:14,000
would send temperatures lower, and he predicted worldwide cooling.

208
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:18,560
But all three of his predictions turned out to be way under actual temperatures.

209
00:18:18,560 --> 00:18:22,480
They were not just wrong, they were headed in completely the wrong direction.

210
00:18:23,280 --> 00:18:26,800
Richard Lindzen thought cloud cover provided the Earth with a mechanism

211
00:18:26,800 --> 00:18:28,800
which kept the Earth's temperatures stable.

212
00:18:29,520 --> 00:18:33,600
Nice idea, but his prediction also turned out to be way out.

213
00:18:35,360 --> 00:18:38,480
Willy Soon claimed the Sun drives global temperatures,

214
00:18:38,480 --> 00:18:42,800
but that prediction fizzled out when solar irradiance and global temperatures

215
00:18:42,800 --> 00:18:44,960
went in completely opposite directions.

216
00:18:46,080 --> 00:18:49,760
I wanted to go through the whole list, but I've already run out of time.

217
00:18:50,480 --> 00:18:55,200
You can debunk the rest of the list yourself, simply by checking where the claim came from,

218
00:18:55,200 --> 00:18:59,120
whether the prediction has been accurately reported by Fox News,

219
00:18:59,120 --> 00:19:01,440
and whether it's based on a scientific study.

220
00:19:02,160 --> 00:19:05,600
So let's close, as always, by looking at what the science says.

221
00:19:06,640 --> 00:19:10,880
The scientific prediction that increased CO2 would cause temperature rise

222
00:19:10,880 --> 00:19:13,360
is now well over a century old.

223
00:19:13,360 --> 00:19:17,840
As far back as the 1950s, this had been quantified so accurately

224
00:19:18,400 --> 00:19:21,280
that the rate of warming was close to actual values.

225
00:19:22,160 --> 00:19:25,440
And from that, researchers could make other predictions.

226
00:19:25,440 --> 00:19:28,880
They predicted decades ago that increased levels of CO2

227
00:19:28,880 --> 00:19:33,520
would cause the Greenland and West Antarctica ice sheets to start melting.

228
00:19:33,520 --> 00:19:35,440
And that prediction was correct.

229
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:40,000
This graph shows the loss of Greenland ice since 2002,

230
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:43,520
and now West Antarctica is also measurably losing ice.

231
00:19:44,320 --> 00:19:46,400
Studies predicted warmer oceans,

232
00:19:46,480 --> 00:19:48,960
and as we've seen, that prediction was correct.

233
00:19:49,760 --> 00:19:53,520
Decades ago, they predicted that global warming would lead to more evaporation

234
00:19:53,520 --> 00:19:56,640
and higher water vapour content in the atmosphere.

235
00:19:56,640 --> 00:19:57,140
Correct.

236
00:19:58,160 --> 00:20:02,080
Decades ago, researchers predicted that high northern latitudes

237
00:20:02,080 --> 00:20:04,960
would warm much faster than lower latitudes.

238
00:20:04,960 --> 00:20:06,480
Another correct prediction.

239
00:20:07,840 --> 00:20:10,560
Shrinking Arctic sea ice was predicted.

240
00:20:10,560 --> 00:20:16,000
Again, this prediction goes back decades, long before the ice was measurably shrinking.

241
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:21,680
The only prediction that was wrong was the IPCC's estimate of how fast the ice would shrink.

242
00:20:21,680 --> 00:20:23,840
It's actually happening much faster.

243
00:20:24,800 --> 00:20:28,640
And researchers predicted that glaciers worldwide would retreat,

244
00:20:28,640 --> 00:20:30,560
and that's happening worldwide.

245
00:20:31,200 --> 00:20:34,400
A few glaciers are advancing because of local factors,

246
00:20:34,400 --> 00:20:36,720
but the vast majority are shrinking.

247
00:20:37,360 --> 00:20:40,880
And so we get into the phenomena that follow on from these changes.

248
00:20:41,440 --> 00:20:45,520
Of course, it's not hard to figure out that warmer oceans, which increase in volume,

249
00:20:46,080 --> 00:20:52,000
and melting ice, which adds more water to the oceans, both result in sea level rise.

250
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:53,760
Even critics don't deny that.

251
00:20:54,320 --> 00:20:57,200
What they say is that we're not seeing it.

252
00:20:57,200 --> 00:21:00,080
Same with drought, flooding, and stronger hurricanes.

253
00:21:00,080 --> 00:21:01,360
We're just not seeing it.

254
00:21:02,640 --> 00:21:08,160
Of course, that's true if what you're expecting is that by now the Midwest should be a desert,

255
00:21:08,160 --> 00:21:11,920
the Arctic should be ice-free, the Great Lakes should be drying up,

256
00:21:11,920 --> 00:21:14,160
and New York should be underwater.

257
00:21:14,160 --> 00:21:18,000
We've already seen what the scientific predictions really are for the Midwest,

258
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:19,680
Arctic ice, and the Great Lakes.

259
00:21:20,320 --> 00:21:26,320
And as for New York, James Hansen didn't predict that the city would be underwater by 2018,

260
00:21:26,320 --> 00:21:30,160
or Manhattan, or even parts of Manhattan for that matter.

261
00:21:30,160 --> 00:21:33,360
Of course, I'm going to get a lot of posts insisting that he did.

262
00:21:33,920 --> 00:21:36,240
So before you post, here's an idea.

263
00:21:36,800 --> 00:21:38,320
Do what Jerry Taylor did.

264
00:21:38,960 --> 00:21:43,520
Don't just repeat talking points because that's what you've read in a hundred blogs,

265
00:21:43,520 --> 00:21:46,080
or because that's what you think you're supposed to believe.

266
00:21:46,640 --> 00:21:49,840
Like Jerry Taylor, go back and check your facts.

267
00:21:50,560 --> 00:21:55,840
In this case, check where Hansen supposedly said this and find out what he actually said.

268
00:21:56,480 --> 00:22:00,400
Then see if there's a scientific study that supports what he actually said.

269
00:22:01,200 --> 00:22:04,800
If people still believe this myth then I'll be very happy to make a video

270
00:22:04,800 --> 00:22:06,880
showing how to track it back to its source.

271
00:22:07,840 --> 00:22:13,200
What researchers have predicted is that sea levels will rise about three feet this century.

272
00:22:13,760 --> 00:22:16,400
That's an average of about 10 millimetres a year.

273
00:22:17,120 --> 00:22:22,640
Sea levels are currently rising at about three millimetres a year, in line with predictions,

274
00:22:22,640 --> 00:22:26,640
and accelerating as the oceans heat up and ice melt accelerates.

275
00:22:27,440 --> 00:22:32,960
That may not be as dramatic as this, but the scientific conclusion is that it'll destroy

276
00:22:32,960 --> 00:22:37,920
coastal infrastructure, cause coastal erosion, salination, and storm surges.

277
00:22:38,560 --> 00:22:41,200
Some low-lying areas are already feeling that.

278
00:22:41,920 --> 00:22:45,760
If nothing else is done to curb the rise in CO2 emissions,

279
00:22:45,760 --> 00:22:50,240
the scientific prediction is for continuing sea level rise into the future.

280
00:22:50,880 --> 00:22:55,840
We're certainly seeing the destruction of coral reefs because of rising ocean temperatures,

281
00:22:55,840 --> 00:22:59,120
and that will affect fish stocks and coastal erosion.

282
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:05,280
With droughts, forest fires, and floods, it's much harder to detect the global warming signal

283
00:23:05,280 --> 00:23:07,760
among the general shifts in weather patterns,

284
00:23:07,840 --> 00:23:11,680
a bit like trying to detect smoking as the cause of lung cancer in a patient.

285
00:23:12,480 --> 00:23:16,480
But the more patients you have, the easier it is to detect a pattern.

286
00:23:17,200 --> 00:23:20,400
So in recent years, researchers have become more confident

287
00:23:20,400 --> 00:23:24,080
that the record floods, droughts, and forest fires we're seeing,

288
00:23:24,080 --> 00:23:27,760
and record strong hurricanes are the result of global warming.

289
00:23:28,480 --> 00:23:31,680
As for reduced water supply because of glacial melt,

290
00:23:31,680 --> 00:23:34,320
that's another prediction that's now discernible.

291
00:23:35,120 --> 00:23:39,520
I do understand why people might be confused about all these misleading messages on the

292
00:23:39,520 --> 00:23:42,560
blogosphere about what the science actually says.

293
00:23:43,360 --> 00:23:45,040
But the solution is pretty simple.

294
00:23:45,840 --> 00:23:51,040
Tune out bloggers' opinions and go to reputable scientific institutions like,

295
00:23:51,040 --> 00:23:54,320
if you're an American, the National Academy of Sciences,

296
00:23:54,320 --> 00:23:56,640
the National Snow and Ice Data Center,

297
00:23:56,640 --> 00:23:59,520
the American Association for the Advancement of Science,

298
00:23:59,520 --> 00:24:01,440
NASA, the American Chemical Society,

299
00:24:01,440 --> 00:24:02,960
the American Geophysical Union,

300
00:24:02,960 --> 00:24:04,800
the American Meteorological Society,

301
00:24:04,800 --> 00:24:06,560
the Federation of American Scientists,

302
00:24:06,560 --> 00:24:08,320
the Geological Society of America,

303
00:24:08,320 --> 00:24:10,400
or the United States Geological Survey.

304
00:24:11,360 --> 00:24:15,040
Most of them have information about global warming and climate change

305
00:24:15,040 --> 00:24:17,520
that reflects what's in the scientific literature.

306
00:24:18,640 --> 00:24:21,760
If you're a conspiracy theorist and you don't trust them,

307
00:24:21,760 --> 00:24:26,960
then go to websites run by respected scientific institutions in other countries

308
00:24:26,960 --> 00:24:30,080
like the Royal Society, the Meteorological Office,

309
00:24:30,080 --> 00:24:33,840
the Geological Survey, or the Royal Meteorological Society in the UK,

310
00:24:34,480 --> 00:24:36,400
or the French Academy of Sciences,

311
00:24:36,400 --> 00:24:38,480
the German Academy of Natural Sciences,

312
00:24:38,480 --> 00:24:39,840
the Max Planck Institute,

313
00:24:39,840 --> 00:24:41,360
the Royal Society of Canada,

314
00:24:41,360 --> 00:24:43,200
the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences,

315
00:24:43,200 --> 00:24:44,720
the Science Council of Japan,

316
00:24:44,720 --> 00:24:46,800
or the Denmark Meteorological Institute.

317
00:24:47,600 --> 00:24:52,320
I'm not disagreeing with people like Crowder who say that some predictions are wrong

318
00:24:52,320 --> 00:24:55,440
if he's citing politicians and newspaper stories,

319
00:24:55,440 --> 00:24:58,320
even if the newspaper story didn't say what he thought it said.

320
00:24:58,960 --> 00:25:02,000
But if a lot of these people are getting their predictions wrong,

321
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:05,120
and peer-reviewed scientific studies are getting them right,

322
00:25:05,680 --> 00:25:08,960
then surely the answer is go with the science.
