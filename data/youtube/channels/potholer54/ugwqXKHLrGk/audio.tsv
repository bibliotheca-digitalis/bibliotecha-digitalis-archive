0	6080	What you do need to take into account here is that people base their lives on your projections
6080	11520	and it turned out that none of it was true. You painted a doomsday climate change scenario,
11520	15440	farmers, city planners, taxpayers, they believe, none of it was correct. So you can't just
15440	18640	admonish them now. You can't just look down your nose at them now and say, well, I can't,
18640	22000	why wouldn't you, why wouldn't you believe us, you silly bumpkin? Well, because of you.
22880	25760	I don't believe you. You lied last time. You don't believe science?
26640	31680	What's got Steven Crowder and his friends worked up is a projection about water levels in the
31680	37040	Great Lakes, just one of many forecasts related to the consequences of climate change.
37760	42080	You might be forgiven for thinking he's attacking researchers for getting their projections wrong.
42720	46240	In fact, he was citing this prediction by a politician.
46240	50400	What we're seeing in global warming is the evaporation of our Great Lakes.
51360	52800	It's a scary thing.
52800	54880	And this prediction from a news article.
55440	59200	And here we have an article from USA Today. I remember this article. I think it was in 2012,
59200	63840	2013. They said it would take decades of rain, decades of rain, heavy, heavy rain,
63840	68960	just to return to normal. OK, it took two years. Actually, the article didn't say anything of the
68960	74960	sort. I tracked it down where it talked about the restoration of lake levels. It wasn't quoting
74960	80640	a scientific study. It was quoting a retired hydrologist who said it would take years of
80640	87760	consistent rain to return Lake Michigan and Lake Huron to normal. So, no, not decades of rain.
88640	94080	But Crowder was spot on with his criticism of the politician. Now, Senator Durbin's right in
94080	99600	saying we get evaporation from the Great Lakes. And according to scientific research, that's been
99600	105840	increasing because of higher water temperatures and diminished ice cover. But he either didn't
105840	112160	know or didn't mention that this evaporation is offset by water coming in from the catchment area.
112160	117360	When you say levels will undeniably, undoubtedly continue to descend to record low levels due to
117360	122080	climate change and exclusively climate change, they have to plan their seasons for things like
122080	127200	more erosion, less underpass room for waterway bridges. They have to plan extensive dredging of
127200	130160	harbors. City engineering comes into play, not to mention the private businesses. They have to
130160	134800	adjust their business models based on your projections of shorefront. Crowder did say in
134800	140480	the video that he wasn't going to look at the science, but perhaps he should. Because business
140480	147120	managers, town planners and farmers don't base their lives or future plans on a claim by a senator.
147760	151840	They plan based on properly conducted peer-reviewed scientific research.
152640	159280	So what does the science say? Far from predicting scary evaporation, the 2007
159280	164160	International Upper Great Lakes study found that future lake levels would remain within the
164160	169840	historical range. The most recent long-term projections by the US Army Corps of Engineers,
169840	175440	which is responsible for monitoring the Great Lakes, only looks ahead five years. But their
175440	181200	conclusion was that during that time, water levels would vary more, but with an average higher than
181200	186880	the historical range. Where are we now? Lake Superior is already near record high levels.
186880	191280	By May could reach a record that was set in the mid 1980s. Lake Erie could reach record highs
191280	195840	later this spring. Lake Michigan and Huron also expected to be much higher, much, much higher
195840	202080	than historically normal levels. It only took a few years to get to significantly higher than
202080	206480	normal levels. And I remember this because I was in Michigan. Fair enough, Stephen, but why didn't
206480	212960	you tell your listeners that this is exactly what scientific studies had predicted? Anyway, this
212960	217920	video isn't about the Great Lakes or Stephen Crowder. It just so happened he released a video
218000	223200	rubbishing climate predictions at the same time I was researching this video about climate
223200	230000	predictions, so it made a very good point. People often misrepresent the science, but that's not an
230000	236480	exclusively left-wing or a right-wing phenomenon. It's done by politicians, op-ed writers, lobbyists
236480	242800	and bloggers on both sides of the political spectrum. But through all this misrepresentation
242800	248880	and political squabbling, an important fact has been overlooked. That scientific studies in this
248880	254160	field have a very good track record in getting their projections right, just as they did with
254160	260240	the Great Lakes. And if you're already gasping in disbelief at that, it probably means you've
260240	265920	been spending way too much time listening to bloggers and political pundits. The same goes
265920	271520	for this popular list of supposedly failed scientific conclusions from Fox News, copied
271520	277840	by this vlogger and many others. Here now are the top 10 global warming predictions
277840	284480	gotten wrong. Number 10 from the UK came this prediction. Within a few years, a scientist said,
284480	290400	children just aren't going to know what snow is. Snowfall will be very rare. That, according to
290400	298400	Dr David Vinner, senior research scientist at the Climate Research Unit, CRU, East Anglia.
298400	304400	Yes, and I've debunked this claim myself. It's not based on any scientific study. It comes from
304400	309840	a newspaper interview and it's nonsense. Of course, a lot of people will be saying,
309840	315280	but he's a scientist. Surely anything scientists say must be based on scientific research.
315840	320160	Well, if you've watched my channel, you'll know that scientists spout all sorts of crap when
320160	325760	they're not confined to the rigorous demands of scientific publishing. The reason we have
325840	331600	peer-reviewed scientific publishing is to ensure that conclusions are supported by evidence.
331600	336640	Calculations and analyses have to be done strictly according to the scientific method.
337200	342240	That's why, to use Steven Crowder's yardstick, planners, farmers and business people
342240	348320	base their lives and futures on properly published science, not random statements in newspapers and
348320	355520	on TV. Dr Viner didn't cite a study that supported his claim and the independent newspaper didn't ask
355520	361600	for one. But I did, and here's the lame response I got from the organisation Viner worked for.
362480	367040	In other words, the answer is no. There's no scientific study supporting his claim.
368160	373760	Bloggers have tried to cite other predictions of no more snow. Most, like Viner's, are completely
373760	380320	unsupported by scientific studies. But this one supposedly comes from the IPCC, and the allegation
380320	385280	that the prediction failed has been mindlessly copied by other bloggers who never bothered to
385280	391360	check it. Here's the statement from the IPCC report they quote. In the North America section,
391360	396960	bottom paragraph here, it says milder winter temperatures will decrease heavy snowstorms,
396960	402320	but could cause an increase in freezing rain. The section a bit further down that the bloggers
402320	408960	never cite is this prediction. Fewer periods of extreme cold, fewer snowstorms, although there
408960	414560	may be an increase in the number of intense storms. This blogger claims the prediction is
414560	421040	wrong because the northern hemisphere's snow area shows remarkably little change since 1967.
421040	425280	But the prediction wasn't for the northern hemisphere, it was for North America.
425840	431280	It wasn't a prediction about snow area, but about snow storms. There was no mention of a
431280	438240	start point in 1967, and no mention of an end point in 2017. It's no good debunking
438240	442720	a prediction if your yardstick is something completely different to that of the prediction.
443920	448000	Of course, if you're living in a part of the USA affected by those snowstorms,
448000	453120	it won't look as though the continent is getting milder, but remember that there are other places
453120	460000	in North America besides where you live. Even a year before the independent story came out,
460000	465920	another scientific study was also predicting more intense snowstorms. According to the researchers'
465920	471920	model, as ice melts in the Arctic, it'll create a high pressure zone moving cold air further south
471920	477440	in winter. And because of a weakened jet stream, another consequence of global warming that I
477440	483040	explained in my video on hurricanes, this cold air will no longer be contained within the Arctic
483040	488480	circle. It'll spill out, bringing Arctic weather conditions to Europe and North America.
489280	495600	The prediction of colder Arctic air moving south was so accurate that a projected meteorological
495600	502160	pattern from Petakov and Semenov's 2010 paper looks almost identical to a mass of Arctic air
502160	507600	that swept Europe a few years later, and a similar pattern has now hit the United States several
507600	513760	years running. The red areas are where temperatures are well above normal, the blue areas are where
514000	519920	it's well below normal. It looks as though the Arctic is warming so fast that freezing air is
519920	526160	being pushed out further south, and essentially that's what's happening. So when it comes to an
526160	531760	end to snow, the newspaper may have got it wrong, but the scientific predictions, the ones backed
531760	537520	by peer-reviewed scientific research, were unfortunately all too accurate. Number nine,
537600	544640	by 1995 the greenhouse effect will be desolating the hard land of North America and Eurasia with
544640	553040	horrific drought causing crop failures and riots. By 1996 the Platte River of Nebraska will be dry,
553600	559680	that according to Michael Oppenheimer. But according to Fox News, which compiled the list,
559680	565920	this claim came from a book, not a scientific study. So again we have to find out what the
565920	571840	science says. NOAA, which made a study of the midwest, looked at the trend over the next 90
571840	577920	years based on a number of different scenarios, and the Met Office looked ahead to the year 2100.
578480	582800	Both predicted that the midwest would get drier and hotter over the next century,
583360	589440	but no scientific study predicted that climate change would look like this in midwestern states
589440	597840	by 1995 or 1996. Number eight, arctic specialist Brent Belkom says a general warming trend over
597840	604640	the north pole is melting the polar ice cap and may produce an ice-free arctic ocean by the year
604640	612720	2000. Arctic specialist? Well he was a Norwegian aviator in the 1930s who flew a lot in the arctic,
612720	617440	but no prizes for guessing that he never wrote a scientific study on future melting,
617440	623760	he was simply giving his opinion to a newspaper. Predictions about the arctic also pop up regularly
623760	630960	in my channel fora, but all too often the experts in their field turn out to be Al Gore, who's not
630960	636720	an expert and hasn't published a study on arctic ice. Al Gore's claim is based on something a
636720	643600	researcher called Wieslaw Maslowski said at a meeting of the American Geophysical Union in 2007,
643600	647280	that the arctic might be ice-free during the summer within five years.
648320	653920	Nearly all the peer-reviewed studies at the time were predicting an ice-free summer arctic decades
653920	660160	ahead, around 2070. In fact, later measurements showed that the arctic is melting much faster
660160	666000	than predicted, so most recent studies have brought the date forward, closer to the range of between
666000	687840	2040 and 2060. According to Fox News, which compiled the list, AP got this from a study by
687840	693440	the Atmospheric and Environmental Research Inc, but it doesn't say where the study was published
693440	698480	or from when this temperature rise is supposed to be measured or what the margin of error is.
698480	702320	It's impossible to compare this prediction if we don't know what it was predicting.
703520	708720	In its rebuttal, Fox News cites global temperatures, but the study itself supposedly
708720	714240	cited nationwide temperatures. But if Fox News wants to look at global temperatures, there's a
714240	719760	much more famous prediction from that time that does that, and one that bloggers frequently cite
719760	726640	as a failure. In 1988, James Hansen looked at forcing bicarbon dioxide based on three possible
726640	731600	scenarios, depending on what governments and industry decided to do in the next few decades.
732560	738320	Scenario A showed what would happen to temperatures if no action was taken to curb CO2 emissions
738320	745200	and there was exponential growth. In other words, the growth in CO2 concentration accelerated.
745200	750560	Scenario B showed temperatures assuming some action was taken to curb CO2 emissions
750560	756080	and there was a linear rate of growth. And Scenario C showed temperatures assuming cuts
756080	761440	in CO2 emissions. As it turned out, action was taken to curb CO2 emissions,
761440	768000	thanks in large part to the Kyoto Protocol. So Scenario A was avoided. What the world ended up
768000	774640	with was linear growth, Scenario B. This is what Hansen predicted would be the temperature rise,
774640	778400	30 years on, how does that compare with the actual temperature rise?
780160	786240	Pretty much spot on. Hansen used a climate sensitivity of 4.2 degrees centigrade for
786240	790320	his projection, whereas more recent research shows the sensitivity
790320	796560	closer to 3 degrees centigrade. If 3 degrees is used, the projection is even more accurate.
797360	800960	Now of course, people who spend all their time in chat rooms and blogs
800960	806880	hearing the mantra that the models are wrong are not going to accept this. I get it. You've
806880	811280	seen graphs that show something completely different. So where did those come from?
811920	817920	In 1998, a climatologist called Patrick Michaels told a House of Representatives committee that
817920	822480	actual temperature measurements had failed to follow the projection made by Hansen 10 years
822480	828800	earlier. As evidence, he showed Hansen's three different scenarios and compared them to actual
828800	835360	temperatures. At least that's what he should have done. What he actually did was airbrush out the
835360	840640	scenario that followed the real rise in CO2 concentration, and only showed the projected
840640	846560	temperature rise caused by accelerating CO2 emissions, a scenario that never happened.
847440	853200	It's hard to dismiss this as a mistake, because Michaels is a qualified research climatologist
853200	858320	and understands how projections work, and he knew what the measured rise in CO2 was.
858880	862400	But I should mention that he was no longer a research climatologist
862400	866720	when he testified. Four years earlier, he'd started a lobbying company,
867280	871760	sorry, an advocacy company, called New Hope Environmental Services.
872560	876720	I can't tell you who funds him. I'll let Patrick Michaels tell you himself.
876720	878560	What I'm saying is that...
878560	880320	Is your research funded by these industries?
880320	883760	Not largely. The fact of the matter is...
883760	887760	Can I ask you what percentage of your work is funded by the petroleum industry?
887760	890160	I don't know. 40%? I don't know.
890160	893760	There's nothing wrong with being an advocate for oil industry interests,
893760	899920	and that shouldn't matter or make any difference, as long as his testimony to Congress in 1998
899920	904000	was scientifically accurate. Unfortunately, it wasn't.
904800	908560	In fact, it was so misleading that it caused a senior spokesperson for the
908560	913360	libertarian Cato Institute to change his mind when he discovered the deception.
914080	918800	The Cato Institute is a political organization also lobbying against climate change.
919360	923200	Patrick Michaels and Jerry Taylor were their most prominent spokesmen.
924000	928000	Not being a scientist, Taylor simply repeated Michael's claims
928000	930160	that Hansen's forecasts were way off.
930960	935360	After one particular TV interview where he gave the usual talking points,
935360	937040	he describes what happened next.
937600	942000	After we got done with the programme and were back in the green room getting the make-up off,
942000	943200	Joe said to me,
943200	945840	Did you even read that testimony you've just talked about?
946400	948960	And when I told him it had been a while, he said,
948960	951280	I'm daring you to go back and double-check this.
952000	955120	He told me that some of Hansen's projections were spot on.
955920	961120	So I went back to my office and I re-read Hansen's testimony, and Joe was correct.
961760	965840	So then I talked to the climate skeptics who had made this argument to me,
965840	970160	and it turns out they'd done so with full knowledge that they were being misleading.
971120	974560	Taylor, by the way, is still with the Cato Institute,
974560	978000	and he still advocates for his libertarian political views.
978640	981760	But he does so without having to misrepresent the science.
982400	987760	But Michaels is still running his company and still trying to discredit Hansen's prediction.
987760	992160	In this recent Wall Street Journal op-ed, he does show Scenario B,
992160	997200	but he's come up with a new airbrushing technique for pretending the temperatures don't match it,
997200	999200	as explained in the accompanying text.
999840	1004160	Global surface temperature has not increased significantly since 2000,
1004160	1008400	discounting the larger-than-usual El Niño of 2015-16.
1009120	1012400	Well, that's a novel approach to getting the answer you want.
1012400	1017040	But El Niño is an integral part of the temperature pattern, as is La Niña.
1017680	1022480	Shown in blue here, La Niña is a period when the oceans suck in heat from the atmosphere,
1022480	1025920	and El Niño is a period when that heat is expelled.
1025920	1030240	If we go to the time period in question and look at the far right of the picture,
1030240	1034560	what Michaels has done is simply airbrush out the most recent El Niño
1034560	1038480	in order to make atmospheric temperatures look lower than they really are.
1038480	1040320	Now you see it, now you don't.
1041040	1046320	Of course, the most ardent conspiracy theorists will claim that the data showing temperature rise
1046320	1050960	and ice melt and glacier retreat and warming oceans are all fake,
1050960	1055040	and that geologists, oceanographers, climatologists, glaciologists,
1055040	1059440	journal editors and analysts of different nationalities in different countries
1059440	1062800	are all in on a huge worldwide conspiracy.
1062800	1067680	But even Patrick Michaels, Roy Spencer and other critics don't dispute the data.
1068320	1071680	If that's what they thought, they'd simply show the evidence for that,
1071680	1073920	rather than resort to all this airbrushing.
1074960	1077440	So how have the predictions of the critics been doing?
1078080	1082640	A few researchers thought other factors were a bigger forcing than carbon dioxide
1082640	1084400	and predicted that the Earth would cool.
1085280	1089440	Don Easterbrook predicted that a Pacific Ocean cycle known as the PDO
1090000	1094000	would send temperatures lower, and he predicted worldwide cooling.
1094000	1098560	But all three of his predictions turned out to be way under actual temperatures.
1098560	1102480	They were not just wrong, they were headed in completely the wrong direction.
1103280	1106800	Richard Lindzen thought cloud cover provided the Earth with a mechanism
1106800	1108800	which kept the Earth's temperatures stable.
1109520	1113600	Nice idea, but his prediction also turned out to be way out.
1115360	1118480	Willy Soon claimed the Sun drives global temperatures,
1118480	1122800	but that prediction fizzled out when solar irradiance and global temperatures
1122800	1124960	went in completely opposite directions.
1126080	1129760	I wanted to go through the whole list, but I've already run out of time.
1130480	1135200	You can debunk the rest of the list yourself, simply by checking where the claim came from,
1135200	1139120	whether the prediction has been accurately reported by Fox News,
1139120	1141440	and whether it's based on a scientific study.
1142160	1145600	So let's close, as always, by looking at what the science says.
1146640	1150880	The scientific prediction that increased CO2 would cause temperature rise
1150880	1153360	is now well over a century old.
1153360	1157840	As far back as the 1950s, this had been quantified so accurately
1158400	1161280	that the rate of warming was close to actual values.
1162160	1165440	And from that, researchers could make other predictions.
1165440	1168880	They predicted decades ago that increased levels of CO2
1168880	1173520	would cause the Greenland and West Antarctica ice sheets to start melting.
1173520	1175440	And that prediction was correct.
1176000	1180000	This graph shows the loss of Greenland ice since 2002,
1180000	1183520	and now West Antarctica is also measurably losing ice.
1184320	1186400	Studies predicted warmer oceans,
1186480	1188960	and as we've seen, that prediction was correct.
1189760	1193520	Decades ago, they predicted that global warming would lead to more evaporation
1193520	1196640	and higher water vapour content in the atmosphere.
1196640	1197140	Correct.
1198160	1202080	Decades ago, researchers predicted that high northern latitudes
1202080	1204960	would warm much faster than lower latitudes.
1204960	1206480	Another correct prediction.
1207840	1210560	Shrinking Arctic sea ice was predicted.
1210560	1216000	Again, this prediction goes back decades, long before the ice was measurably shrinking.
1216000	1221680	The only prediction that was wrong was the IPCC's estimate of how fast the ice would shrink.
1221680	1223840	It's actually happening much faster.
1224800	1228640	And researchers predicted that glaciers worldwide would retreat,
1228640	1230560	and that's happening worldwide.
1231200	1234400	A few glaciers are advancing because of local factors,
1234400	1236720	but the vast majority are shrinking.
1237360	1240880	And so we get into the phenomena that follow on from these changes.
1241440	1245520	Of course, it's not hard to figure out that warmer oceans, which increase in volume,
1246080	1252000	and melting ice, which adds more water to the oceans, both result in sea level rise.
1252000	1253760	Even critics don't deny that.
1254320	1257200	What they say is that we're not seeing it.
1257200	1260080	Same with drought, flooding, and stronger hurricanes.
1260080	1261360	We're just not seeing it.
1262640	1268160	Of course, that's true if what you're expecting is that by now the Midwest should be a desert,
1268160	1271920	the Arctic should be ice-free, the Great Lakes should be drying up,
1271920	1274160	and New York should be underwater.
1274160	1278000	We've already seen what the scientific predictions really are for the Midwest,
1278000	1279680	Arctic ice, and the Great Lakes.
1280320	1286320	And as for New York, James Hansen didn't predict that the city would be underwater by 2018,
1286320	1290160	or Manhattan, or even parts of Manhattan for that matter.
1290160	1293360	Of course, I'm going to get a lot of posts insisting that he did.
1293920	1296240	So before you post, here's an idea.
1296800	1298320	Do what Jerry Taylor did.
1298960	1303520	Don't just repeat talking points because that's what you've read in a hundred blogs,
1303520	1306080	or because that's what you think you're supposed to believe.
1306640	1309840	Like Jerry Taylor, go back and check your facts.
1310560	1315840	In this case, check where Hansen supposedly said this and find out what he actually said.
1316480	1320400	Then see if there's a scientific study that supports what he actually said.
1321200	1324800	If people still believe this myth then I'll be very happy to make a video
1324800	1326880	showing how to track it back to its source.
1327840	1333200	What researchers have predicted is that sea levels will rise about three feet this century.
1333760	1336400	That's an average of about 10 millimetres a year.
1337120	1342640	Sea levels are currently rising at about three millimetres a year, in line with predictions,
1342640	1346640	and accelerating as the oceans heat up and ice melt accelerates.
1347440	1352960	That may not be as dramatic as this, but the scientific conclusion is that it'll destroy
1352960	1357920	coastal infrastructure, cause coastal erosion, salination, and storm surges.
1358560	1361200	Some low-lying areas are already feeling that.
1361920	1365760	If nothing else is done to curb the rise in CO2 emissions,
1365760	1370240	the scientific prediction is for continuing sea level rise into the future.
1370880	1375840	We're certainly seeing the destruction of coral reefs because of rising ocean temperatures,
1375840	1379120	and that will affect fish stocks and coastal erosion.
1380000	1385280	With droughts, forest fires, and floods, it's much harder to detect the global warming signal
1385280	1387760	among the general shifts in weather patterns,
1387840	1391680	a bit like trying to detect smoking as the cause of lung cancer in a patient.
1392480	1396480	But the more patients you have, the easier it is to detect a pattern.
1397200	1400400	So in recent years, researchers have become more confident
1400400	1404080	that the record floods, droughts, and forest fires we're seeing,
1404080	1407760	and record strong hurricanes are the result of global warming.
1408480	1411680	As for reduced water supply because of glacial melt,
1411680	1414320	that's another prediction that's now discernible.
1415120	1419520	I do understand why people might be confused about all these misleading messages on the
1419520	1422560	blogosphere about what the science actually says.
1423360	1425040	But the solution is pretty simple.
1425840	1431040	Tune out bloggers' opinions and go to reputable scientific institutions like,
1431040	1434320	if you're an American, the National Academy of Sciences,
1434320	1436640	the National Snow and Ice Data Center,
1436640	1439520	the American Association for the Advancement of Science,
1439520	1441440	NASA, the American Chemical Society,
1441440	1442960	the American Geophysical Union,
1442960	1444800	the American Meteorological Society,
1444800	1446560	the Federation of American Scientists,
1446560	1448320	the Geological Society of America,
1448320	1450400	or the United States Geological Survey.
1451360	1455040	Most of them have information about global warming and climate change
1455040	1457520	that reflects what's in the scientific literature.
1458640	1461760	If you're a conspiracy theorist and you don't trust them,
1461760	1466960	then go to websites run by respected scientific institutions in other countries
1466960	1470080	like the Royal Society, the Meteorological Office,
1470080	1473840	the Geological Survey, or the Royal Meteorological Society in the UK,
1474480	1476400	or the French Academy of Sciences,
1476400	1478480	the German Academy of Natural Sciences,
1478480	1479840	the Max Planck Institute,
1479840	1481360	the Royal Society of Canada,
1481360	1483200	the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences,
1483200	1484720	the Science Council of Japan,
1484720	1486800	or the Denmark Meteorological Institute.
1487600	1492320	I'm not disagreeing with people like Crowder who say that some predictions are wrong
1492320	1495440	if he's citing politicians and newspaper stories,
1495440	1498320	even if the newspaper story didn't say what he thought it said.
1498960	1502000	But if a lot of these people are getting their predictions wrong,
1502000	1505120	and peer-reviewed scientific studies are getting them right,
1505680	1508960	then surely the answer is go with the science.
