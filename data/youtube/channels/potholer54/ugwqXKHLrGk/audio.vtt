00:00.000 --> 00:06.080
What you do need to take into account here is that people base their lives on your projections

00:06.080 --> 00:11.520
and it turned out that none of it was true. You painted a doomsday climate change scenario,

00:11.520 --> 00:15.440
farmers, city planners, taxpayers, they believe, none of it was correct. So you can't just

00:15.440 --> 00:18.640
admonish them now. You can't just look down your nose at them now and say, well, I can't,

00:18.640 --> 00:22.000
why wouldn't you, why wouldn't you believe us, you silly bumpkin? Well, because of you.

00:22.880 --> 00:25.760
I don't believe you. You lied last time. You don't believe science?

00:26.640 --> 00:31.680
What's got Steven Crowder and his friends worked up is a projection about water levels in the

00:31.680 --> 00:37.040
Great Lakes, just one of many forecasts related to the consequences of climate change.

00:37.760 --> 00:42.080
You might be forgiven for thinking he's attacking researchers for getting their projections wrong.

00:42.720 --> 00:46.240
In fact, he was citing this prediction by a politician.

00:46.240 --> 00:50.400
What we're seeing in global warming is the evaporation of our Great Lakes.

00:51.360 --> 00:52.800
It's a scary thing.

00:52.800 --> 00:54.880
And this prediction from a news article.

00:55.440 --> 00:59.200
And here we have an article from USA Today. I remember this article. I think it was in 2012,

00:59.200 --> 01:03.840
2013. They said it would take decades of rain, decades of rain, heavy, heavy rain,

01:03.840 --> 01:08.960
just to return to normal. OK, it took two years. Actually, the article didn't say anything of the

01:08.960 --> 01:14.960
sort. I tracked it down where it talked about the restoration of lake levels. It wasn't quoting

01:14.960 --> 01:20.640
a scientific study. It was quoting a retired hydrologist who said it would take years of

01:20.640 --> 01:27.760
consistent rain to return Lake Michigan and Lake Huron to normal. So, no, not decades of rain.

01:28.640 --> 01:34.080
But Crowder was spot on with his criticism of the politician. Now, Senator Durbin's right in

01:34.080 --> 01:39.600
saying we get evaporation from the Great Lakes. And according to scientific research, that's been

01:39.600 --> 01:45.840
increasing because of higher water temperatures and diminished ice cover. But he either didn't

01:45.840 --> 01:52.160
know or didn't mention that this evaporation is offset by water coming in from the catchment area.

01:52.160 --> 01:57.360
When you say levels will undeniably, undoubtedly continue to descend to record low levels due to

01:57.360 --> 02:02.080
climate change and exclusively climate change, they have to plan their seasons for things like

02:02.080 --> 02:07.200
more erosion, less underpass room for waterway bridges. They have to plan extensive dredging of

02:07.200 --> 02:10.160
harbors. City engineering comes into play, not to mention the private businesses. They have to

02:10.160 --> 02:14.800
adjust their business models based on your projections of shorefront. Crowder did say in

02:14.800 --> 02:20.480
the video that he wasn't going to look at the science, but perhaps he should. Because business

02:20.480 --> 02:27.120
managers, town planners and farmers don't base their lives or future plans on a claim by a senator.

02:27.760 --> 02:31.840
They plan based on properly conducted peer-reviewed scientific research.

02:32.640 --> 02:39.280
So what does the science say? Far from predicting scary evaporation, the 2007

02:39.280 --> 02:44.160
International Upper Great Lakes study found that future lake levels would remain within the

02:44.160 --> 02:49.840
historical range. The most recent long-term projections by the US Army Corps of Engineers,

02:49.840 --> 02:55.440
which is responsible for monitoring the Great Lakes, only looks ahead five years. But their

02:55.440 --> 03:01.200
conclusion was that during that time, water levels would vary more, but with an average higher than

03:01.200 --> 03:06.880
the historical range. Where are we now? Lake Superior is already near record high levels.

03:06.880 --> 03:11.280
By May could reach a record that was set in the mid 1980s. Lake Erie could reach record highs

03:11.280 --> 03:15.840
later this spring. Lake Michigan and Huron also expected to be much higher, much, much higher

03:15.840 --> 03:22.080
than historically normal levels. It only took a few years to get to significantly higher than

03:22.080 --> 03:26.480
normal levels. And I remember this because I was in Michigan. Fair enough, Stephen, but why didn't

03:26.480 --> 03:32.960
you tell your listeners that this is exactly what scientific studies had predicted? Anyway, this

03:32.960 --> 03:37.920
video isn't about the Great Lakes or Stephen Crowder. It just so happened he released a video

03:38.000 --> 03:43.200
rubbishing climate predictions at the same time I was researching this video about climate

03:43.200 --> 03:50.000
predictions, so it made a very good point. People often misrepresent the science, but that's not an

03:50.000 --> 03:56.480
exclusively left-wing or a right-wing phenomenon. It's done by politicians, op-ed writers, lobbyists

03:56.480 --> 04:02.800
and bloggers on both sides of the political spectrum. But through all this misrepresentation

04:02.800 --> 04:08.880
and political squabbling, an important fact has been overlooked. That scientific studies in this

04:08.880 --> 04:14.160
field have a very good track record in getting their projections right, just as they did with

04:14.160 --> 04:20.240
the Great Lakes. And if you're already gasping in disbelief at that, it probably means you've

04:20.240 --> 04:25.920
been spending way too much time listening to bloggers and political pundits. The same goes

04:25.920 --> 04:31.520
for this popular list of supposedly failed scientific conclusions from Fox News, copied

04:31.520 --> 04:37.840
by this vlogger and many others. Here now are the top 10 global warming predictions

04:37.840 --> 04:44.480
gotten wrong. Number 10 from the UK came this prediction. Within a few years, a scientist said,

04:44.480 --> 04:50.400
children just aren't going to know what snow is. Snowfall will be very rare. That, according to

04:50.400 --> 04:58.400
Dr David Vinner, senior research scientist at the Climate Research Unit, CRU, East Anglia.

04:58.400 --> 05:04.400
Yes, and I've debunked this claim myself. It's not based on any scientific study. It comes from

05:04.400 --> 05:09.840
a newspaper interview and it's nonsense. Of course, a lot of people will be saying,

05:09.840 --> 05:15.280
but he's a scientist. Surely anything scientists say must be based on scientific research.

05:15.840 --> 05:20.160
Well, if you've watched my channel, you'll know that scientists spout all sorts of crap when

05:20.160 --> 05:25.760
they're not confined to the rigorous demands of scientific publishing. The reason we have

05:25.840 --> 05:31.600
peer-reviewed scientific publishing is to ensure that conclusions are supported by evidence.

05:31.600 --> 05:36.640
Calculations and analyses have to be done strictly according to the scientific method.

05:37.200 --> 05:42.240
That's why, to use Steven Crowder's yardstick, planners, farmers and business people

05:42.240 --> 05:48.320
base their lives and futures on properly published science, not random statements in newspapers and

05:48.320 --> 05:55.520
on TV. Dr Viner didn't cite a study that supported his claim and the independent newspaper didn't ask

05:55.520 --> 06:01.600
for one. But I did, and here's the lame response I got from the organisation Viner worked for.

06:02.480 --> 06:07.040
In other words, the answer is no. There's no scientific study supporting his claim.

06:08.160 --> 06:13.760
Bloggers have tried to cite other predictions of no more snow. Most, like Viner's, are completely

06:13.760 --> 06:20.320
unsupported by scientific studies. But this one supposedly comes from the IPCC, and the allegation

06:20.320 --> 06:25.280
that the prediction failed has been mindlessly copied by other bloggers who never bothered to

06:25.280 --> 06:31.360
check it. Here's the statement from the IPCC report they quote. In the North America section,

06:31.360 --> 06:36.960
bottom paragraph here, it says milder winter temperatures will decrease heavy snowstorms,

06:36.960 --> 06:42.320
but could cause an increase in freezing rain. The section a bit further down that the bloggers

06:42.320 --> 06:48.960
never cite is this prediction. Fewer periods of extreme cold, fewer snowstorms, although there

06:48.960 --> 06:54.560
may be an increase in the number of intense storms. This blogger claims the prediction is

06:54.560 --> 07:01.040
wrong because the northern hemisphere's snow area shows remarkably little change since 1967.

07:01.040 --> 07:05.280
But the prediction wasn't for the northern hemisphere, it was for North America.

07:05.840 --> 07:11.280
It wasn't a prediction about snow area, but about snow storms. There was no mention of a

07:11.280 --> 07:18.240
start point in 1967, and no mention of an end point in 2017. It's no good debunking

07:18.240 --> 07:22.720
a prediction if your yardstick is something completely different to that of the prediction.

07:23.920 --> 07:28.000
Of course, if you're living in a part of the USA affected by those snowstorms,

07:28.000 --> 07:33.120
it won't look as though the continent is getting milder, but remember that there are other places

07:33.120 --> 07:40.000
in North America besides where you live. Even a year before the independent story came out,

07:40.000 --> 07:45.920
another scientific study was also predicting more intense snowstorms. According to the researchers'

07:45.920 --> 07:51.920
model, as ice melts in the Arctic, it'll create a high pressure zone moving cold air further south

07:51.920 --> 07:57.440
in winter. And because of a weakened jet stream, another consequence of global warming that I

07:57.440 --> 08:03.040
explained in my video on hurricanes, this cold air will no longer be contained within the Arctic

08:03.040 --> 08:08.480
circle. It'll spill out, bringing Arctic weather conditions to Europe and North America.

08:09.280 --> 08:15.600
The prediction of colder Arctic air moving south was so accurate that a projected meteorological

08:15.600 --> 08:22.160
pattern from Petakov and Semenov's 2010 paper looks almost identical to a mass of Arctic air

08:22.160 --> 08:27.600
that swept Europe a few years later, and a similar pattern has now hit the United States several

08:27.600 --> 08:33.760
years running. The red areas are where temperatures are well above normal, the blue areas are where

08:34.000 --> 08:39.920
it's well below normal. It looks as though the Arctic is warming so fast that freezing air is

08:39.920 --> 08:46.160
being pushed out further south, and essentially that's what's happening. So when it comes to an

08:46.160 --> 08:51.760
end to snow, the newspaper may have got it wrong, but the scientific predictions, the ones backed

08:51.760 --> 08:57.520
by peer-reviewed scientific research, were unfortunately all too accurate. Number nine,

08:57.600 --> 09:04.640
by 1995 the greenhouse effect will be desolating the hard land of North America and Eurasia with

09:04.640 --> 09:13.040
horrific drought causing crop failures and riots. By 1996 the Platte River of Nebraska will be dry,

09:13.600 --> 09:19.680
that according to Michael Oppenheimer. But according to Fox News, which compiled the list,

09:19.680 --> 09:25.920
this claim came from a book, not a scientific study. So again we have to find out what the

09:25.920 --> 09:31.840
science says. NOAA, which made a study of the midwest, looked at the trend over the next 90

09:31.840 --> 09:37.920
years based on a number of different scenarios, and the Met Office looked ahead to the year 2100.

09:38.480 --> 09:42.800
Both predicted that the midwest would get drier and hotter over the next century,

09:43.360 --> 09:49.440
but no scientific study predicted that climate change would look like this in midwestern states

09:49.440 --> 09:57.840
by 1995 or 1996. Number eight, arctic specialist Brent Belkom says a general warming trend over

09:57.840 --> 10:04.640
the north pole is melting the polar ice cap and may produce an ice-free arctic ocean by the year

10:04.640 --> 10:12.720
2000. Arctic specialist? Well he was a Norwegian aviator in the 1930s who flew a lot in the arctic,

10:12.720 --> 10:17.440
but no prizes for guessing that he never wrote a scientific study on future melting,

10:17.440 --> 10:23.760
he was simply giving his opinion to a newspaper. Predictions about the arctic also pop up regularly

10:23.760 --> 10:30.960
in my channel fora, but all too often the experts in their field turn out to be Al Gore, who's not

10:30.960 --> 10:36.720
an expert and hasn't published a study on arctic ice. Al Gore's claim is based on something a

10:36.720 --> 10:43.600
researcher called Wieslaw Maslowski said at a meeting of the American Geophysical Union in 2007,

10:43.600 --> 10:47.280
that the arctic might be ice-free during the summer within five years.

10:48.320 --> 10:53.920
Nearly all the peer-reviewed studies at the time were predicting an ice-free summer arctic decades

10:53.920 --> 11:00.160
ahead, around 2070. In fact, later measurements showed that the arctic is melting much faster

11:00.160 --> 11:06.000
than predicted, so most recent studies have brought the date forward, closer to the range of between

11:06.000 --> 11:27.840
2040 and 2060. According to Fox News, which compiled the list, AP got this from a study by

11:27.840 --> 11:33.440
the Atmospheric and Environmental Research Inc, but it doesn't say where the study was published

11:33.440 --> 11:38.480
or from when this temperature rise is supposed to be measured or what the margin of error is.

11:38.480 --> 11:42.320
It's impossible to compare this prediction if we don't know what it was predicting.

11:43.520 --> 11:48.720
In its rebuttal, Fox News cites global temperatures, but the study itself supposedly

11:48.720 --> 11:54.240
cited nationwide temperatures. But if Fox News wants to look at global temperatures, there's a

11:54.240 --> 11:59.760
much more famous prediction from that time that does that, and one that bloggers frequently cite

11:59.760 --> 12:06.640
as a failure. In 1988, James Hansen looked at forcing bicarbon dioxide based on three possible

12:06.640 --> 12:11.600
scenarios, depending on what governments and industry decided to do in the next few decades.

12:12.560 --> 12:18.320
Scenario A showed what would happen to temperatures if no action was taken to curb CO2 emissions

12:18.320 --> 12:25.200
and there was exponential growth. In other words, the growth in CO2 concentration accelerated.

12:25.200 --> 12:30.560
Scenario B showed temperatures assuming some action was taken to curb CO2 emissions

12:30.560 --> 12:36.080
and there was a linear rate of growth. And Scenario C showed temperatures assuming cuts

12:36.080 --> 12:41.440
in CO2 emissions. As it turned out, action was taken to curb CO2 emissions,

12:41.440 --> 12:48.000
thanks in large part to the Kyoto Protocol. So Scenario A was avoided. What the world ended up

12:48.000 --> 12:54.640
with was linear growth, Scenario B. This is what Hansen predicted would be the temperature rise,

12:54.640 --> 12:58.400
30 years on, how does that compare with the actual temperature rise?

13:00.160 --> 13:06.240
Pretty much spot on. Hansen used a climate sensitivity of 4.2 degrees centigrade for

13:06.240 --> 13:10.320
his projection, whereas more recent research shows the sensitivity

13:10.320 --> 13:16.560
closer to 3 degrees centigrade. If 3 degrees is used, the projection is even more accurate.

13:17.360 --> 13:20.960
Now of course, people who spend all their time in chat rooms and blogs

13:20.960 --> 13:26.880
hearing the mantra that the models are wrong are not going to accept this. I get it. You've

13:26.880 --> 13:31.280
seen graphs that show something completely different. So where did those come from?

13:31.920 --> 13:37.920
In 1998, a climatologist called Patrick Michaels told a House of Representatives committee that

13:37.920 --> 13:42.480
actual temperature measurements had failed to follow the projection made by Hansen 10 years

13:42.480 --> 13:48.800
earlier. As evidence, he showed Hansen's three different scenarios and compared them to actual

13:48.800 --> 13:55.360
temperatures. At least that's what he should have done. What he actually did was airbrush out the

13:55.360 --> 14:00.640
scenario that followed the real rise in CO2 concentration, and only showed the projected

14:00.640 --> 14:06.560
temperature rise caused by accelerating CO2 emissions, a scenario that never happened.

14:07.440 --> 14:13.200
It's hard to dismiss this as a mistake, because Michaels is a qualified research climatologist

14:13.200 --> 14:18.320
and understands how projections work, and he knew what the measured rise in CO2 was.

14:18.880 --> 14:22.400
But I should mention that he was no longer a research climatologist

14:22.400 --> 14:26.720
when he testified. Four years earlier, he'd started a lobbying company,

14:27.280 --> 14:31.760
sorry, an advocacy company, called New Hope Environmental Services.

14:32.560 --> 14:36.720
I can't tell you who funds him. I'll let Patrick Michaels tell you himself.

14:36.720 --> 14:38.560
What I'm saying is that...

14:38.560 --> 14:40.320
Is your research funded by these industries?

14:40.320 --> 14:43.760
Not largely. The fact of the matter is...

14:43.760 --> 14:47.760
Can I ask you what percentage of your work is funded by the petroleum industry?

14:47.760 --> 14:50.160
I don't know. 40%? I don't know.

14:50.160 --> 14:53.760
There's nothing wrong with being an advocate for oil industry interests,

14:53.760 --> 14:59.920
and that shouldn't matter or make any difference, as long as his testimony to Congress in 1998

14:59.920 --> 15:04.000
was scientifically accurate. Unfortunately, it wasn't.

15:04.800 --> 15:08.560
In fact, it was so misleading that it caused a senior spokesperson for the

15:08.560 --> 15:13.360
libertarian Cato Institute to change his mind when he discovered the deception.

15:14.080 --> 15:18.800
The Cato Institute is a political organization also lobbying against climate change.

15:19.360 --> 15:23.200
Patrick Michaels and Jerry Taylor were their most prominent spokesmen.

15:24.000 --> 15:28.000
Not being a scientist, Taylor simply repeated Michael's claims

15:28.000 --> 15:30.160
that Hansen's forecasts were way off.

15:30.960 --> 15:35.360
After one particular TV interview where he gave the usual talking points,

15:35.360 --> 15:37.040
he describes what happened next.

15:37.600 --> 15:42.000
After we got done with the programme and were back in the green room getting the make-up off,

15:42.000 --> 15:43.200
Joe said to me,

15:43.200 --> 15:45.840
Did you even read that testimony you've just talked about?

15:46.400 --> 15:48.960
And when I told him it had been a while, he said,

15:48.960 --> 15:51.280
I'm daring you to go back and double-check this.

15:52.000 --> 15:55.120
He told me that some of Hansen's projections were spot on.

15:55.920 --> 16:01.120
So I went back to my office and I re-read Hansen's testimony, and Joe was correct.

16:01.760 --> 16:05.840
So then I talked to the climate skeptics who had made this argument to me,

16:05.840 --> 16:10.160
and it turns out they'd done so with full knowledge that they were being misleading.

16:11.120 --> 16:14.560
Taylor, by the way, is still with the Cato Institute,

16:14.560 --> 16:18.000
and he still advocates for his libertarian political views.

16:18.640 --> 16:21.760
But he does so without having to misrepresent the science.

16:22.400 --> 16:27.760
But Michaels is still running his company and still trying to discredit Hansen's prediction.

16:27.760 --> 16:32.160
In this recent Wall Street Journal op-ed, he does show Scenario B,

16:32.160 --> 16:37.200
but he's come up with a new airbrushing technique for pretending the temperatures don't match it,

16:37.200 --> 16:39.200
as explained in the accompanying text.

16:39.840 --> 16:44.160
Global surface temperature has not increased significantly since 2000,

16:44.160 --> 16:48.400
discounting the larger-than-usual El Niño of 2015-16.

16:49.120 --> 16:52.400
Well, that's a novel approach to getting the answer you want.

16:52.400 --> 16:57.040
But El Niño is an integral part of the temperature pattern, as is La Niña.

16:57.680 --> 17:02.480
Shown in blue here, La Niña is a period when the oceans suck in heat from the atmosphere,

17:02.480 --> 17:05.920
and El Niño is a period when that heat is expelled.

17:05.920 --> 17:10.240
If we go to the time period in question and look at the far right of the picture,

17:10.240 --> 17:14.560
what Michaels has done is simply airbrush out the most recent El Niño

17:14.560 --> 17:18.480
in order to make atmospheric temperatures look lower than they really are.

17:18.480 --> 17:20.320
Now you see it, now you don't.

17:21.040 --> 17:26.320
Of course, the most ardent conspiracy theorists will claim that the data showing temperature rise

17:26.320 --> 17:30.960
and ice melt and glacier retreat and warming oceans are all fake,

17:30.960 --> 17:35.040
and that geologists, oceanographers, climatologists, glaciologists,

17:35.040 --> 17:39.440
journal editors and analysts of different nationalities in different countries

17:39.440 --> 17:42.800
are all in on a huge worldwide conspiracy.

17:42.800 --> 17:47.680
But even Patrick Michaels, Roy Spencer and other critics don't dispute the data.

17:48.320 --> 17:51.680
If that's what they thought, they'd simply show the evidence for that,

17:51.680 --> 17:53.920
rather than resort to all this airbrushing.

17:54.960 --> 17:57.440
So how have the predictions of the critics been doing?

17:58.080 --> 18:02.640
A few researchers thought other factors were a bigger forcing than carbon dioxide

18:02.640 --> 18:04.400
and predicted that the Earth would cool.

18:05.280 --> 18:09.440
Don Easterbrook predicted that a Pacific Ocean cycle known as the PDO

18:10.000 --> 18:14.000
would send temperatures lower, and he predicted worldwide cooling.

18:14.000 --> 18:18.560
But all three of his predictions turned out to be way under actual temperatures.

18:18.560 --> 18:22.480
They were not just wrong, they were headed in completely the wrong direction.

18:23.280 --> 18:26.800
Richard Lindzen thought cloud cover provided the Earth with a mechanism

18:26.800 --> 18:28.800
which kept the Earth's temperatures stable.

18:29.520 --> 18:33.600
Nice idea, but his prediction also turned out to be way out.

18:35.360 --> 18:38.480
Willy Soon claimed the Sun drives global temperatures,

18:38.480 --> 18:42.800
but that prediction fizzled out when solar irradiance and global temperatures

18:42.800 --> 18:44.960
went in completely opposite directions.

18:46.080 --> 18:49.760
I wanted to go through the whole list, but I've already run out of time.

18:50.480 --> 18:55.200
You can debunk the rest of the list yourself, simply by checking where the claim came from,

18:55.200 --> 18:59.120
whether the prediction has been accurately reported by Fox News,

18:59.120 --> 19:01.440
and whether it's based on a scientific study.

19:02.160 --> 19:05.600
So let's close, as always, by looking at what the science says.

19:06.640 --> 19:10.880
The scientific prediction that increased CO2 would cause temperature rise

19:10.880 --> 19:13.360
is now well over a century old.

19:13.360 --> 19:17.840
As far back as the 1950s, this had been quantified so accurately

19:18.400 --> 19:21.280
that the rate of warming was close to actual values.

19:22.160 --> 19:25.440
And from that, researchers could make other predictions.

19:25.440 --> 19:28.880
They predicted decades ago that increased levels of CO2

19:28.880 --> 19:33.520
would cause the Greenland and West Antarctica ice sheets to start melting.

19:33.520 --> 19:35.440
And that prediction was correct.

19:36.000 --> 19:40.000
This graph shows the loss of Greenland ice since 2002,

19:40.000 --> 19:43.520
and now West Antarctica is also measurably losing ice.

19:44.320 --> 19:46.400
Studies predicted warmer oceans,

19:46.480 --> 19:48.960
and as we've seen, that prediction was correct.

19:49.760 --> 19:53.520
Decades ago, they predicted that global warming would lead to more evaporation

19:53.520 --> 19:56.640
and higher water vapour content in the atmosphere.

19:56.640 --> 19:57.140
Correct.

19:58.160 --> 20:02.080
Decades ago, researchers predicted that high northern latitudes

20:02.080 --> 20:04.960
would warm much faster than lower latitudes.

20:04.960 --> 20:06.480
Another correct prediction.

20:07.840 --> 20:10.560
Shrinking Arctic sea ice was predicted.

20:10.560 --> 20:16.000
Again, this prediction goes back decades, long before the ice was measurably shrinking.

20:16.000 --> 20:21.680
The only prediction that was wrong was the IPCC's estimate of how fast the ice would shrink.

20:21.680 --> 20:23.840
It's actually happening much faster.

20:24.800 --> 20:28.640
And researchers predicted that glaciers worldwide would retreat,

20:28.640 --> 20:30.560
and that's happening worldwide.

20:31.200 --> 20:34.400
A few glaciers are advancing because of local factors,

20:34.400 --> 20:36.720
but the vast majority are shrinking.

20:37.360 --> 20:40.880
And so we get into the phenomena that follow on from these changes.

20:41.440 --> 20:45.520
Of course, it's not hard to figure out that warmer oceans, which increase in volume,

20:46.080 --> 20:52.000
and melting ice, which adds more water to the oceans, both result in sea level rise.

20:52.000 --> 20:53.760
Even critics don't deny that.

20:54.320 --> 20:57.200
What they say is that we're not seeing it.

20:57.200 --> 21:00.080
Same with drought, flooding, and stronger hurricanes.

21:00.080 --> 21:01.360
We're just not seeing it.

21:02.640 --> 21:08.160
Of course, that's true if what you're expecting is that by now the Midwest should be a desert,

21:08.160 --> 21:11.920
the Arctic should be ice-free, the Great Lakes should be drying up,

21:11.920 --> 21:14.160
and New York should be underwater.

21:14.160 --> 21:18.000
We've already seen what the scientific predictions really are for the Midwest,

21:18.000 --> 21:19.680
Arctic ice, and the Great Lakes.

21:20.320 --> 21:26.320
And as for New York, James Hansen didn't predict that the city would be underwater by 2018,

21:26.320 --> 21:30.160
or Manhattan, or even parts of Manhattan for that matter.

21:30.160 --> 21:33.360
Of course, I'm going to get a lot of posts insisting that he did.

21:33.920 --> 21:36.240
So before you post, here's an idea.

21:36.800 --> 21:38.320
Do what Jerry Taylor did.

21:38.960 --> 21:43.520
Don't just repeat talking points because that's what you've read in a hundred blogs,

21:43.520 --> 21:46.080
or because that's what you think you're supposed to believe.

21:46.640 --> 21:49.840
Like Jerry Taylor, go back and check your facts.

21:50.560 --> 21:55.840
In this case, check where Hansen supposedly said this and find out what he actually said.

21:56.480 --> 22:00.400
Then see if there's a scientific study that supports what he actually said.

22:01.200 --> 22:04.800
If people still believe this myth then I'll be very happy to make a video

22:04.800 --> 22:06.880
showing how to track it back to its source.

22:07.840 --> 22:13.200
What researchers have predicted is that sea levels will rise about three feet this century.

22:13.760 --> 22:16.400
That's an average of about 10 millimetres a year.

22:17.120 --> 22:22.640
Sea levels are currently rising at about three millimetres a year, in line with predictions,

22:22.640 --> 22:26.640
and accelerating as the oceans heat up and ice melt accelerates.

22:27.440 --> 22:32.960
That may not be as dramatic as this, but the scientific conclusion is that it'll destroy

22:32.960 --> 22:37.920
coastal infrastructure, cause coastal erosion, salination, and storm surges.

22:38.560 --> 22:41.200
Some low-lying areas are already feeling that.

22:41.920 --> 22:45.760
If nothing else is done to curb the rise in CO2 emissions,

22:45.760 --> 22:50.240
the scientific prediction is for continuing sea level rise into the future.

22:50.880 --> 22:55.840
We're certainly seeing the destruction of coral reefs because of rising ocean temperatures,

22:55.840 --> 22:59.120
and that will affect fish stocks and coastal erosion.

23:00.000 --> 23:05.280
With droughts, forest fires, and floods, it's much harder to detect the global warming signal

23:05.280 --> 23:07.760
among the general shifts in weather patterns,

23:07.840 --> 23:11.680
a bit like trying to detect smoking as the cause of lung cancer in a patient.

23:12.480 --> 23:16.480
But the more patients you have, the easier it is to detect a pattern.

23:17.200 --> 23:20.400
So in recent years, researchers have become more confident

23:20.400 --> 23:24.080
that the record floods, droughts, and forest fires we're seeing,

23:24.080 --> 23:27.760
and record strong hurricanes are the result of global warming.

23:28.480 --> 23:31.680
As for reduced water supply because of glacial melt,

23:31.680 --> 23:34.320
that's another prediction that's now discernible.

23:35.120 --> 23:39.520
I do understand why people might be confused about all these misleading messages on the

23:39.520 --> 23:42.560
blogosphere about what the science actually says.

23:43.360 --> 23:45.040
But the solution is pretty simple.

23:45.840 --> 23:51.040
Tune out bloggers' opinions and go to reputable scientific institutions like,

23:51.040 --> 23:54.320
if you're an American, the National Academy of Sciences,

23:54.320 --> 23:56.640
the National Snow and Ice Data Center,

23:56.640 --> 23:59.520
the American Association for the Advancement of Science,

23:59.520 --> 24:01.440
NASA, the American Chemical Society,

24:01.440 --> 24:02.960
the American Geophysical Union,

24:02.960 --> 24:04.800
the American Meteorological Society,

24:04.800 --> 24:06.560
the Federation of American Scientists,

24:06.560 --> 24:08.320
the Geological Society of America,

24:08.320 --> 24:10.400
or the United States Geological Survey.

24:11.360 --> 24:15.040
Most of them have information about global warming and climate change

24:15.040 --> 24:17.520
that reflects what's in the scientific literature.

24:18.640 --> 24:21.760
If you're a conspiracy theorist and you don't trust them,

24:21.760 --> 24:26.960
then go to websites run by respected scientific institutions in other countries

24:26.960 --> 24:30.080
like the Royal Society, the Meteorological Office,

24:30.080 --> 24:33.840
the Geological Survey, or the Royal Meteorological Society in the UK,

24:34.480 --> 24:36.400
or the French Academy of Sciences,

24:36.400 --> 24:38.480
the German Academy of Natural Sciences,

24:38.480 --> 24:39.840
the Max Planck Institute,

24:39.840 --> 24:41.360
the Royal Society of Canada,

24:41.360 --> 24:43.200
the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences,

24:43.200 --> 24:44.720
the Science Council of Japan,

24:44.720 --> 24:46.800
or the Denmark Meteorological Institute.

24:47.600 --> 24:52.320
I'm not disagreeing with people like Crowder who say that some predictions are wrong

24:52.320 --> 24:55.440
if he's citing politicians and newspaper stories,

24:55.440 --> 24:58.320
even if the newspaper story didn't say what he thought it said.

24:58.960 --> 25:02.000
But if a lot of these people are getting their predictions wrong,

25:02.000 --> 25:05.120
and peer-reviewed scientific studies are getting them right,

25:05.680 --> 25:08.960
then surely the answer is go with the science.
