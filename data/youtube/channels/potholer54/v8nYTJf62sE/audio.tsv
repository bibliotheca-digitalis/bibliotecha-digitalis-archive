0	7000	When Bill O'Reilly asked Kirk Cameron to give his best shot in proving the existence of God, this is what he said.
7000	19000	The fact that a painting proves there must be a painter, the human body proves there must be a designer because of its complexity and because of the information we can see down at the DNA level.
19000	24000	The problem for fundamentalists like Cameron is that this argument can be too easily flattened.
24000	29000	In this video I want to show what scientists have actually deduced about the origins of life.
29000	35000	So let's start by putting the artist and painting myth to rest. Why can't paintings paint themselves?
35000	40000	Simple, because they're made of chemicals that can't replicate themselves.
40000	44000	Living matter, on the other hand, does contain a chemical that can replicate itself.
44000	51000	Even if God made DNA, he doesn't need to intervene every time animals mate. The DNA does the job on its own.
51000	58000	So the real question is, how did DNA appear? How did living matter come from non-living sludge?
58000	67000	Here again, fundamentalists need to drop a common argument that seems to be based on complete ignorance of current scientific hypotheses, which is this.
67000	70000	Of course that's not what scientists believe.
70000	75000	Life popping out of nowhere is no better a theory than life popping out of the hand of a deity.
75000	79000	So what do scientists believe about the origin of life?
79000	82000	Let's take this step by step.
82000	87000	The first step involves looking at the primordial earth 4.7 billion years ago.
87000	93000	There it is, mostly wet, very warm, and with an atmosphere composed of all sorts of gases.
93000	97000	Hydrogen, hydrogen cyanide, methane and ammonia are among them.
97000	102000	DNA is a long chain molecule made from just four different types of nucleotide.
102000	106000	So the first question is, where did the nucleotides come from?
106000	118000	In 1961, a researcher called Juan Oro left hydrogen cyanide and ammonia to stew in an aqueous solution in his laboratory under conditions very similar to those that prevailed on the primordial earth.
118000	124000	Left alone, the solution produced adenine, one of the four nucleotide bases that make up DNA.
124000	131000	To make a complete nucleotide, these bases need to gain a sugar called ribose and a group of phosphates.
131000	137000	Biochemists think they know how the phosphate group formed. They're now trying to find out how the ribose is attached.
137000	144000	Once nucleotides formed, the next step was to join together to make chains called polynucleotides.
144000	155000	In the 1980s, researchers found that a clay called montmorillonite, which was abundant on the primordial sea floor and in hot pools of water on land, is the perfect catalyst for this process.
156000	165000	Some of these long polynucleotide chains like ribonucleic acid or RNA are able to make copies of themselves.
165000	174000	The copies aren't always perfect, mistakes creep in, but some imperfectly copied molecules would have been better adapted to the environment than others.
174000	182000	These successful molecules continued to replicate and pass on their traits, while weaker or less well adapted molecules would have broken apart.
183000	190000	As RNA molecules replicated themselves, they shared their environment with other chemicals that thrive in montmorillonite clay.
190000	197000	One group called lipids have a natural tendency to clump together to form spherical structures called micelles.
197000	204000	RNA molecules that attracted these lipids would therefore find themselves protected inside a micelle membrane.
204000	210000	Because they were better protected, they better survived and replicated more successfully.
210000	213000	There you have the first primitive cells.
213000	217000	They look nothing like the complex cells we have today for a very good reason.
217000	220000	Over 3.7 billion years, they've evolved.
220000	224000	I'll tackle the subject of evolution in another video.
224000	227000	Over hundreds of millions of years, RNA grew more complex.
227000	233000	The single strand became a double strand and the better adapted DNA molecule evolved.
233000	239000	One of the differences between RNA and DNA is that DNA needs proteins to replicate itself.
239000	243000	Proteins are made of amino acids, which are often called the building blocks of life.
243000	246000	So where did the first ones come from?
246000	248000	No, there was no need for God.
248000	256000	A number of experiments using montmorillonite have produced not only amino acids, but long chains of amino acids called polypeptides.
256000	263000	Montmorillonite, it turns out, is a natural breeding ground for all kinds of complex organic chemicals.
264000	271000	It has to be said that this research is in its infancy and current hypotheses are nowhere near as solid as the theory of evolution,
271000	276000	which has been around for 150 years and has overwhelming evidence to support it.
276000	282000	But the reality is a far cry from the idea that scientists believe life popped out of nowhere.
282000	286000	If God did indeed create life, then where did he come in?
286000	289000	Step one, step two, and why?
289000	294000	If the chemical process can happen on its own, why would God need to intervene at all?
294000	302000	Before I go, I just want to look at a couple of other hoary old arguments that have been used and which also show a complete ignorance of science.
305000	306000	Really?
306000	311000	Just because creationist websites like to pass this myth around doesn't make it true.
311000	312000	We know it's not true.
312000	318000	Left alone, organic chemicals can and do polymerize to form longer, more complex chemicals.
321000	322000	Oh, that sad argument.
322000	329000	The fact is that the natural formation of replicating chemicals doesn't conflict with any of the laws of thermodynamics.
329000	335000	People who make that argument need to read the law because I suspect most of them have never done so
335000	339000	and are just mindlessly repeating an urban myth that's already been debunked.
339000	343000	As I've said, we still have a lot more to learn about this process.
343000	348000	Researchers know that there are many more intermediate steps that we haven't yet discovered.
348000	352000	And when all of them are found, there will still be fundamentalists around to say,
352000	356000	ah, but you can't prove that this is how life started on Earth.
356000	358000	No, we probably never will.
358000	364000	But what we can say is if there's a natural process by which the first replicating molecules appeared on Earth,
365000	370000	then we don't need to invent gods, goddesses and other invisible deities to explain it.
370000	372000	Ultimately, this isn't a guessing game.
372000	374000	It's a detective trail.
