00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,000
When Bill O'Reilly asked Kirk Cameron to give his best shot in proving the existence of God, this is what he said.

2
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:19,000
The fact that a painting proves there must be a painter, the human body proves there must be a designer because of its complexity and because of the information we can see down at the DNA level.

3
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:24,000
The problem for fundamentalists like Cameron is that this argument can be too easily flattened.

4
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:29,000
In this video I want to show what scientists have actually deduced about the origins of life.

5
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:35,000
So let's start by putting the artist and painting myth to rest. Why can't paintings paint themselves?

6
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:40,000
Simple, because they're made of chemicals that can't replicate themselves.

7
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:44,000
Living matter, on the other hand, does contain a chemical that can replicate itself.

8
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:51,000
Even if God made DNA, he doesn't need to intervene every time animals mate. The DNA does the job on its own.

9
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:58,000
So the real question is, how did DNA appear? How did living matter come from non-living sludge?

10
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:07,000
Here again, fundamentalists need to drop a common argument that seems to be based on complete ignorance of current scientific hypotheses, which is this.

11
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:10,000
Of course that's not what scientists believe.

12
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:15,000
Life popping out of nowhere is no better a theory than life popping out of the hand of a deity.

13
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:19,000
So what do scientists believe about the origin of life?

14
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:22,000
Let's take this step by step.

15
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:27,000
The first step involves looking at the primordial earth 4.7 billion years ago.

16
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:33,000
There it is, mostly wet, very warm, and with an atmosphere composed of all sorts of gases.

17
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:37,000
Hydrogen, hydrogen cyanide, methane and ammonia are among them.

18
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:42,000
DNA is a long chain molecule made from just four different types of nucleotide.

19
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:46,000
So the first question is, where did the nucleotides come from?

20
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:58,000
In 1961, a researcher called Juan Oro left hydrogen cyanide and ammonia to stew in an aqueous solution in his laboratory under conditions very similar to those that prevailed on the primordial earth.

21
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:04,000
Left alone, the solution produced adenine, one of the four nucleotide bases that make up DNA.

22
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:11,000
To make a complete nucleotide, these bases need to gain a sugar called ribose and a group of phosphates.

23
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:17,000
Biochemists think they know how the phosphate group formed. They're now trying to find out how the ribose is attached.

24
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:24,000
Once nucleotides formed, the next step was to join together to make chains called polynucleotides.

25
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:35,000
In the 1980s, researchers found that a clay called montmorillonite, which was abundant on the primordial sea floor and in hot pools of water on land, is the perfect catalyst for this process.

26
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:45,000
Some of these long polynucleotide chains like ribonucleic acid or RNA are able to make copies of themselves.

27
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:54,000
The copies aren't always perfect, mistakes creep in, but some imperfectly copied molecules would have been better adapted to the environment than others.

28
00:02:54,000 --> 00:03:02,000
These successful molecules continued to replicate and pass on their traits, while weaker or less well adapted molecules would have broken apart.

29
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:10,000
As RNA molecules replicated themselves, they shared their environment with other chemicals that thrive in montmorillonite clay.

30
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:17,000
One group called lipids have a natural tendency to clump together to form spherical structures called micelles.

31
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:24,000
RNA molecules that attracted these lipids would therefore find themselves protected inside a micelle membrane.

32
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:30,000
Because they were better protected, they better survived and replicated more successfully.

33
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:33,000
There you have the first primitive cells.

34
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:37,000
They look nothing like the complex cells we have today for a very good reason.

35
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:40,000
Over 3.7 billion years, they've evolved.

36
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:44,000
I'll tackle the subject of evolution in another video.

37
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:47,000
Over hundreds of millions of years, RNA grew more complex.

38
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:53,000
The single strand became a double strand and the better adapted DNA molecule evolved.

39
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:59,000
One of the differences between RNA and DNA is that DNA needs proteins to replicate itself.

40
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:03,000
Proteins are made of amino acids, which are often called the building blocks of life.

41
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:06,000
So where did the first ones come from?

42
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,000
No, there was no need for God.

43
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:16,000
A number of experiments using montmorillonite have produced not only amino acids, but long chains of amino acids called polypeptides.

44
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:23,000
Montmorillonite, it turns out, is a natural breeding ground for all kinds of complex organic chemicals.

45
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:31,000
It has to be said that this research is in its infancy and current hypotheses are nowhere near as solid as the theory of evolution,

46
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:36,000
which has been around for 150 years and has overwhelming evidence to support it.

47
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:42,000
But the reality is a far cry from the idea that scientists believe life popped out of nowhere.

48
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:46,000
If God did indeed create life, then where did he come in?

49
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:49,000
Step one, step two, and why?

50
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:54,000
If the chemical process can happen on its own, why would God need to intervene at all?

51
00:04:54,000 --> 00:05:02,000
Before I go, I just want to look at a couple of other hoary old arguments that have been used and which also show a complete ignorance of science.

52
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:06,000
Really?

53
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:11,000
Just because creationist websites like to pass this myth around doesn't make it true.

54
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:12,000
We know it's not true.

55
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:18,000
Left alone, organic chemicals can and do polymerize to form longer, more complex chemicals.

56
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:22,000
Oh, that sad argument.

57
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:29,000
The fact is that the natural formation of replicating chemicals doesn't conflict with any of the laws of thermodynamics.

58
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:35,000
People who make that argument need to read the law because I suspect most of them have never done so

59
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:39,000
and are just mindlessly repeating an urban myth that's already been debunked.

60
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:43,000
As I've said, we still have a lot more to learn about this process.

61
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:48,000
Researchers know that there are many more intermediate steps that we haven't yet discovered.

62
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:52,000
And when all of them are found, there will still be fundamentalists around to say,

63
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:56,000
ah, but you can't prove that this is how life started on Earth.

64
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,000
No, we probably never will.

65
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:04,000
But what we can say is if there's a natural process by which the first replicating molecules appeared on Earth,

66
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:10,000
then we don't need to invent gods, goddesses and other invisible deities to explain it.

67
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:12,000
Ultimately, this isn't a guessing game.

68
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:14,000
It's a detective trail.
