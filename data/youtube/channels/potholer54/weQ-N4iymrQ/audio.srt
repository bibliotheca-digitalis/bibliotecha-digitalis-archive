1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,240
After my last video correcting Tony Heller's attempts at fact-checking,

2
00:00:04,240 --> 00:00:08,400
his immediate response was, he really is a glutton for punishment.

3
00:00:08,400 --> 00:00:13,520
But for me, fact-checking isn't a punishment at all. I welcome it, because I want to make my

4
00:00:13,520 --> 00:00:19,680
videos as factually accurate as possible. If I've got something wrong, I want to know about it.

5
00:00:19,680 --> 00:00:25,040
And if even the most determined attempt to find a fault in my videos can't find a single error,

6
00:00:25,040 --> 00:00:30,480
that's even better. Since science is about facts rather than personal opinion,

7
00:00:30,480 --> 00:00:35,680
I'm glad that through this video debate, which entails fact-checking and asking for sources,

8
00:00:35,680 --> 00:00:39,200
people are beginning to see which claims are supported and which claims have been

9
00:00:39,200 --> 00:00:45,920
shown to be wrong or are still unsupported. So let's just get up to speed. These are the

10
00:00:45,920 --> 00:00:51,120
issues we've been discussing that have now been resolved. To read them, just pause the video.

11
00:00:51,760 --> 00:00:56,400
And these are the ones Tony still disputes. So these are the ones I'll deal with in the

12
00:00:56,400 --> 00:01:01,120
second round of this debate. Let's go through his second round video and look at the things

13
00:01:01,120 --> 00:01:12,400
he still disputes. The first six minutes are filled with an explanation of who Milankovitch

14
00:01:12,400 --> 00:01:18,160
was and why we get summers and winters. Then Tony read from an Indiana University website,

15
00:01:18,160 --> 00:01:23,040
which explains what Milankovitch cycles are. All this can be found on Wikipedia,

16
00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:26,080
so let's skip to the part where Tony disputes what I said.

17
00:01:26,080 --> 00:01:31,680
It's of primary importance to explain that climate change and subsequent periods of glaciation

18
00:01:31,680 --> 00:01:37,520
resulting from the following three variables is not due to the total amount of solar energy

19
00:01:37,520 --> 00:01:43,520
reaching Earth. The three Milankovitch cycles impact the seasonality and location of solar

20
00:01:43,520 --> 00:01:48,320
energy around the Earth, thus impacting contrasts between the seasons.

21
00:01:48,960 --> 00:01:53,520
Let's look closely at his claim from the professional paper he cited.

22
00:01:53,520 --> 00:01:59,120
The total insulation received by Earth has varied by less than 0.7 watts per meter.

23
00:01:59,120 --> 00:02:04,400
But this is junk science. As I just pointed out from the Indiana University website,

24
00:02:04,400 --> 00:02:09,440
total solar insulation is irrelevant. But the authors of the paper make exactly

25
00:02:09,440 --> 00:02:15,440
the same point. The reason Tony calls it junk science is because he misread the paper.

26
00:02:15,440 --> 00:02:19,920
The authors say exactly the same thing as the Indiana University website,

27
00:02:19,920 --> 00:02:24,320
that the obliquity of the Earth's axis and the precession of the equinoxes

28
00:02:24,320 --> 00:02:28,960
strongly affect the distribution of available energy between latitudes and seasons.

29
00:02:29,600 --> 00:02:34,160
For example, the variation of the summer insulation at 65 degrees north.

30
00:02:34,960 --> 00:02:39,120
But what they found is that even if you include the response of ice sheets,

31
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:43,680
which was Milankovitch's theory regarding the 65 degree north latitude,

32
00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:47,120
that's still not enough feedback to explain the glacial cycles.

33
00:02:47,920 --> 00:02:52,720
What may explain it, say the authors, is the data from recent ice core samples

34
00:02:52,720 --> 00:02:57,440
showing a likely increase of CO2 and methane, which are powerful greenhouse gases.

35
00:02:58,160 --> 00:03:02,240
They show their figures, they cite their sources, and their conclusions have since

36
00:03:02,240 --> 00:03:05,680
been confirmed by other studies that I cited in my last video.

37
00:03:06,560 --> 00:03:09,040
Just saying they're wrong is not much of an answer.

38
00:03:09,680 --> 00:03:13,600
So Milankovitch's basic idea is accepted by researchers,

39
00:03:13,600 --> 00:03:17,280
but like all theories, every detail is not carved in stone.

40
00:03:17,840 --> 00:03:22,960
Since Milankovitch proposed it 90 odd years ago, researchers have been able to accurately

41
00:03:22,960 --> 00:03:28,080
date these glacial cycles and discovered that Milankovitch cycles don't make a perfect fit.

42
00:03:28,800 --> 00:03:32,320
Lots of new evidence has emerged in the last nine decades,

43
00:03:32,320 --> 00:03:36,240
such as other orbital cycles, ice core data, and so on.

44
00:03:37,040 --> 00:03:40,480
From this new data, researchers have calculated that changes in

45
00:03:40,480 --> 00:03:44,320
insulation and the positive feedback of ice albedo alone

46
00:03:44,320 --> 00:03:47,280
can't explain the advance and retreat of ice sheets.

47
00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:51,200
Other feedback factors like carbon dioxide and methane have to be added.

48
00:03:52,320 --> 00:03:56,080
And for all those who would much rather hear my personal theories, why?

49
00:03:56,800 --> 00:03:59,840
Like Tony, I'm a complete amateur in this field.

50
00:03:59,840 --> 00:04:03,920
If you want to know what amateurs believe, their theories are all over YouTube.

51
00:04:03,920 --> 00:04:08,000
If you want to know what the scientific researchers found, well, this is it.

52
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:14,080
In my first video, I showed Potholer criticizing Al Gore.

53
00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:18,400
My criticism of Potholer was centered around the fact that he just

54
00:04:18,400 --> 00:04:21,120
blew off Al Gore as being someone irrelevant.

55
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:23,600
Actually, that's not what you said. You said this.

56
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:28,160
What he blew over in his discussion was that Al Gore said the exact opposite.

57
00:04:28,160 --> 00:04:31,360
He tried to make it sound like CO2 drove the temperature.

58
00:04:31,360 --> 00:04:35,520
And I answered that by showing how I didn't brush over it at all, clearly.

59
00:04:35,520 --> 00:04:39,600
In his film An Inconvenient Truth, Al Gore used a graph like this to show

60
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:43,520
a correlation between carbon dioxide levels and increased temperatures.

61
00:04:44,160 --> 00:04:47,360
But he obscured the fact that the carbon dioxide increases

62
00:04:47,360 --> 00:04:50,400
lagged the temperature increases by 800 years.

63
00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:55,280
So now that we're up to speed, let's deal with what Tony mistakenly thinks he said.

64
00:04:55,280 --> 00:04:57,600
Did I assert that Al Gore is irrelevant?

65
00:04:58,320 --> 00:05:02,480
As usual, Tony doesn't play a clip, so I'll just have to tell you what I think.

66
00:05:03,200 --> 00:05:07,280
I think Al Gore's very relevant to the public perception of climate science

67
00:05:07,280 --> 00:05:11,760
because he's a high profile figure and millions of people saw his movie.

68
00:05:11,760 --> 00:05:14,880
And he's clearly relevant to people who believe whatever he says.

69
00:05:15,440 --> 00:05:17,760
And that's why I corrected his claims.

70
00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:21,520
But Gore is completely irrelevant in the science world

71
00:05:21,520 --> 00:05:26,400
because he isn't a professional researcher in this field and he isn't publishing any studies.

72
00:05:27,200 --> 00:05:33,040
So his claims should not be cited as scientific fact in newspapers or TV programs,

73
00:05:33,040 --> 00:05:36,640
or be passed off as the conclusions of professional researchers.

74
00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:41,760
By the way, I started making videos about climate science ten years ago,

75
00:05:41,760 --> 00:05:47,600
and the very first one included a criticism of Al Gore's CO2 claim, which I just showed you.

76
00:05:48,160 --> 00:05:53,440
The second one and the fourth one in the series also included corrections of his claims,

77
00:05:53,440 --> 00:05:54,320
like this one.

78
00:05:54,320 --> 00:05:56,400
If Greenland broke up and melted,

79
00:05:57,360 --> 00:06:02,880
or if half of Greenland and half of West Antarctica broke up and melted,

80
00:06:02,880 --> 00:06:06,000
this is what would happen to the sea level in Florida.

81
00:06:06,560 --> 00:06:12,000
Well, yes, but it's rather like saying that if the Rockefeller Center turned into a banana split,

82
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:14,720
ice cream would melt all over Fifth Avenue.

83
00:06:14,720 --> 00:06:18,000
The crucial question is, how likely is that to happen?

84
00:06:19,360 --> 00:06:23,920
Let's look more closely at Al Gore's claim about a 20-foot rise in sea levels.

85
00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:27,280
The important word here, of course, is if.

86
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:29,920
Gore isn't exactly lying.

87
00:06:29,920 --> 00:06:34,640
If these ice sheets melted, then yes, we could get a 20-foot rise in sea levels,

88
00:06:34,640 --> 00:06:38,160
although more recent research suggests the figure would be less.

89
00:06:38,160 --> 00:06:42,080
But no climate scientist is saying it'll happen any time soon.

90
00:06:42,080 --> 00:06:45,840
At current warming rates, the data show it'll take at least a thousand years

91
00:06:45,840 --> 00:06:48,480
for the Greenland ice sheet to completely melt,

92
00:06:48,480 --> 00:06:52,240
and thousands more for the West Antarctic ice sheet to melt.

93
00:06:52,240 --> 00:06:56,400
So let's get back to the ever-shortening list of things I supposedly got wrong.

94
00:06:57,120 --> 00:07:00,400
Now let's look at another appeal to authority by Potholer.

95
00:07:01,280 --> 00:07:05,840
Potholer is describing a single very controversial paper by Shikun

96
00:07:05,840 --> 00:07:09,360
as if that represented the opinion of the scientific community.

97
00:07:10,240 --> 00:07:13,360
Many scientists have poked holes in Shikun's work,

98
00:07:13,360 --> 00:07:16,640
and it's pretty much irrelevant to the discussion anyway.

99
00:07:16,640 --> 00:07:21,040
Actually, those scientists Tony is talking about later retracted their criticisms

100
00:07:21,040 --> 00:07:24,160
and agreed that the Shikun paper was correct after all.

101
00:07:25,920 --> 00:07:29,040
To all those watching, is what I've just said true?

102
00:07:29,040 --> 00:07:29,840
How do you know?

103
00:07:30,560 --> 00:07:34,480
Unless I give you a source, in other words, show who these scientists are

104
00:07:34,480 --> 00:07:38,400
and where they made this retraction, you have no way of fact-checking it.

105
00:07:39,280 --> 00:07:43,120
I have no idea if it's true or even if these scientists exist,

106
00:07:43,120 --> 00:07:47,760
because Tony hasn't given his source either, so I can't fact-check it.

107
00:07:48,480 --> 00:07:53,600
This is why it's important to cite sources to allow people to fact-check assertions.

108
00:07:54,320 --> 00:07:57,760
If many scientists have poked holes in the Shikun paper,

109
00:07:57,760 --> 00:08:01,760
then they'll be in comment papers among the 658 citations

110
00:08:01,760 --> 00:08:04,560
of Shikun's paper listed in the scientific literature.

111
00:08:05,280 --> 00:08:09,040
So all Tony has to do is cite the titles, authors,

112
00:08:09,040 --> 00:08:13,600
dates of publication and journals of these comment papers in his next response,

113
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:17,840
the same way I always cite my sources when I make a claim.

114
00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:20,080
But let's step back a bit.

115
00:08:20,720 --> 00:08:24,960
Tony calls my citing of this scientific study an appeal to authority.

116
00:08:25,680 --> 00:08:29,280
As anyone who's ever studied graduate-level science knows,

117
00:08:29,280 --> 00:08:32,720
citing peer-reviewed papers is standard practice in science.

118
00:08:33,440 --> 00:08:35,360
Not doing so would get you an F.

119
00:08:36,080 --> 00:08:40,880
And at the end of every scientific paper that's published is a list of citations,

120
00:08:40,880 --> 00:08:42,880
because that's how science is done.

121
00:08:43,680 --> 00:08:46,160
An appeal to authority is completely different.

122
00:08:46,720 --> 00:08:51,200
It's insisting that a claim is true simply because a valid authority or

123
00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:55,440
expert on the issue said it was true without any supporting evidence offered.

124
00:08:56,160 --> 00:09:01,920
To give a real example, it's like saying Dr David Viner is a clever man with a PhD.

125
00:09:01,920 --> 00:09:06,640
David Viner says there'll be no more snow in Britain, so there'll be no more snow in Britain.

126
00:09:07,760 --> 00:09:12,640
Viner is indeed an authority, but he didn't publish or cite a peer-reviewed study

127
00:09:12,640 --> 00:09:14,720
showing evidence to support that claim.

128
00:09:15,360 --> 00:09:18,240
So that's what's known as an argument from authority.

129
00:09:19,120 --> 00:09:21,840
The irony is that when Tony does give his sources,

130
00:09:22,400 --> 00:09:27,280
they all take their data from peer-reviewed papers, even if he didn't realize it.

131
00:09:28,400 --> 00:09:30,800
Let's move on to the next unresolved issue.

132
00:09:30,800 --> 00:09:35,520
Anyway, his valid criticism was that I used a 10C change in temperature

133
00:09:35,520 --> 00:09:38,720
for 100 parts per million change in CO2.

134
00:09:38,720 --> 00:09:42,320
And his point was, yes, it was 10C change in Antarctica,

135
00:09:42,320 --> 00:09:44,960
but that wasn't the change in global temperature.

136
00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:50,000
Actually, my point was that Tony claimed I said that a 10 degree rise in temperature

137
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:55,120
was caused by a 100 degree rise in CO2, which he now accepts I didn't say.

138
00:09:55,920 --> 00:09:59,840
And my other point was that it was Tony himself who came up with this figure

139
00:09:59,840 --> 00:10:04,880
by getting a graph off the internet and not fact checking what the temperature data referred to.

140
00:10:05,600 --> 00:10:09,600
So that led to his mistaken belief that these are global temperatures.

141
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:13,840
In fact, they're Antarctic temperatures, which he now accepts he got wrong.

142
00:10:14,480 --> 00:10:16,720
This is the graph he was referring to.

143
00:10:16,720 --> 00:10:18,880
It's not really very hard to find this graph.

144
00:10:18,880 --> 00:10:23,040
It's the first thing that comes up when you type in Antarctic ice core graphs.

145
00:10:23,840 --> 00:10:26,320
He tries to make it sound like I'm hiding something,

146
00:10:26,320 --> 00:10:29,440
but this is just the standard data from the ice cores.

147
00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:32,000
I just assumed that he knew how to use Google.

148
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:35,680
Tony's right in saying it's not hard to find this graph, as I showed.

149
00:10:36,240 --> 00:10:41,120
What requires a bit more intelligence, or knowing how to use Google, as Tony puts it,

150
00:10:41,120 --> 00:10:44,160
is finding out where this graph originated.

151
00:10:44,160 --> 00:10:46,960
In my last video, I showed how I tracked it down.

152
00:10:47,600 --> 00:10:50,000
When I got to the source data, I found that

153
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:53,200
Tony's assumption that these are global temperatures was wrong.

154
00:10:54,080 --> 00:10:56,560
I'm not suggesting you're hiding anything, Tony.

155
00:10:56,560 --> 00:11:00,480
I'm prepared to accept that you didn't know how to fact check this graph,

156
00:11:00,480 --> 00:11:03,200
or didn't realize why fact checking is important.

157
00:11:03,840 --> 00:11:08,240
But I hope you now do appreciate that by not tracking down the source of the data,

158
00:11:08,240 --> 00:11:10,240
you made a mistake in interpreting it.

159
00:11:10,240 --> 00:11:13,280
This graph is from the 1990 IPCC report,

160
00:11:13,280 --> 00:11:18,160
and it shows about a 5C swing in temperature between ice ages and interglacials.

161
00:11:18,160 --> 00:11:21,120
That's about half of what the Antarctic ice cores show.

162
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:27,280
Using even the highest estimates of climate sensitivity from the IPCC report,

163
00:11:27,280 --> 00:11:30,720
you can only account for about 1C swing in temperature

164
00:11:30,720 --> 00:11:34,320
from the 100 parts per million change in carbon dioxide.

165
00:11:34,320 --> 00:11:38,720
So the vast majority of the change can't be due to carbon dioxide.

166
00:11:38,720 --> 00:11:40,640
It has to be due to something else.

167
00:11:40,640 --> 00:11:43,440
But as we've seen, it's not carbon dioxide alone.

168
00:11:44,320 --> 00:11:47,520
But I'm glad that this time Tony's not claiming that I said that

169
00:11:47,520 --> 00:11:52,320
five degrees of warming was caused by a 100 parts per million increase of CO2,

170
00:11:52,320 --> 00:11:53,600
because of course I didn't.

171
00:11:54,240 --> 00:11:56,640
I'm going to explain this again very simply,

172
00:11:56,640 --> 00:12:00,320
and hopefully this time even Potholer will be able to understand.

173
00:12:00,880 --> 00:12:04,800
Methane only has three small narrow spectral spikes,

174
00:12:04,800 --> 00:12:07,280
and only two of any significance.

175
00:12:07,280 --> 00:12:11,200
And both of these small narrow spectral spikes of methane

176
00:12:11,200 --> 00:12:16,480
overlap with the very tall broad spectrum of water vapour.

177
00:12:16,480 --> 00:12:22,400
Water vapour is a much more potent greenhouse gas than nearly irrelevant methane.

178
00:12:22,400 --> 00:12:26,480
But all the measurements and studies show exactly how relevant methane is.

179
00:12:27,040 --> 00:12:29,440
Repeating your unsubstantiated claim,

180
00:12:29,440 --> 00:12:33,920
even when laced with sarcasm, is still just an unsubstantiated claim.

181
00:12:34,880 --> 00:12:38,720
If science was just a question of saying you believe something isn't true,

182
00:12:38,720 --> 00:12:43,040
I could just as easily say yes it is, and you could say no it's not.

183
00:12:43,040 --> 00:12:48,080
I can say yes it is, and we can keep batting back and forth until one of us gives up.

184
00:12:49,040 --> 00:12:52,720
I showed the actual figures for methane's radiative forcing,

185
00:12:52,720 --> 00:12:56,640
the figures for its absorption wavelengths for infrared radiation,

186
00:12:56,640 --> 00:12:58,640
the figures for its longevity,

187
00:12:58,640 --> 00:13:02,000
and the figures for its comparative concentration in the atmosphere.

188
00:13:02,720 --> 00:13:05,280
And I showed the sources of all these figures,

189
00:13:05,280 --> 00:13:09,440
so if Tony thinks they're wrong it's no good just saying I think they're wrong,

190
00:13:09,440 --> 00:13:13,040
he needs to cite studies that also show facts and figures.

191
00:13:13,600 --> 00:13:15,920
Because that's how science is done.

192
00:13:16,720 --> 00:13:18,160
And here's the kicker.

193
00:13:18,160 --> 00:13:22,240
Even the Indiana University website that Tony used as a source

194
00:13:22,240 --> 00:13:24,960
lists methane as a significant greenhouse gas.

195
00:13:26,080 --> 00:13:29,600
If carbon dioxide feedback produced a gain of more than one,

196
00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:31,520
it would become the driver of climate.

197
00:13:31,520 --> 00:13:35,280
It would go out of control and you'd never be able to get out of an ice age.

198
00:13:35,280 --> 00:13:37,040
Or when you started out of an ice age,

199
00:13:37,040 --> 00:13:39,600
you'd never be able to stop and you'd end up like Venus.

200
00:13:39,600 --> 00:13:42,160
Well I already explained this in my last video.

201
00:13:42,720 --> 00:13:47,440
Not because this is my theory, but because this is what researchers have found.

202
00:13:47,440 --> 00:13:51,440
Their conclusions are based on some fairly basic principles of physics.

203
00:13:51,440 --> 00:13:55,360
Once again Tony's only response is to claim that he's right and they must all be wrong.

204
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:58,320
So that doesn't really advance things very far.

205
00:13:58,320 --> 00:14:01,840
If he can come up with a study that says we should have had runaway warming

206
00:14:01,840 --> 00:14:05,200
and the oceans should have boiled, then I'll be very glad to look at it.

207
00:14:05,840 --> 00:14:08,400
So where do we now stand on the remaining issues?

208
00:14:08,960 --> 00:14:12,640
Forcing duty CO2 and methane did not contribute to Glaze Hill cycles.

209
00:14:12,640 --> 00:14:17,680
Well, the paper that Tony said was junk science was the result of him misreading it.

210
00:14:17,680 --> 00:14:20,000
All the scientific studies I've cited,

211
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:23,600
even the source of one of the graphs Tony cited, say they did.

212
00:14:24,480 --> 00:14:29,360
Tony's argument that this wasn't part of Milankovitch's theory over 90 years ago

213
00:14:29,360 --> 00:14:34,160
is very interesting history, but researchers have discovered a lot more since then.

214
00:14:34,560 --> 00:14:39,440
His claim that I blew over Al Gore's misleading speech about CO2 correlation,

215
00:14:39,440 --> 00:14:42,080
as we've seen for the second time, I didn't.

216
00:14:43,200 --> 00:14:45,840
Methane is not a significant greenhouse gas.

217
00:14:45,840 --> 00:14:49,520
Again, all the scientific studies I've cited show otherwise,

218
00:14:49,520 --> 00:14:53,520
and the authors of these studies have measurements and figures to back that up.

219
00:14:53,920 --> 00:14:56,880
Tony hasn't cited any studies that contradict this.

220
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:02,080
Tony, you're now suggesting you want to end this online fact checking debate

221
00:15:02,880 --> 00:15:05,440
about the things I supposedly got wrong,

222
00:15:05,440 --> 00:15:08,800
which of course is your prerogative because you began it.

223
00:15:08,800 --> 00:15:12,080
I'm very glad that by digging up sources and fact checking,

224
00:15:12,080 --> 00:15:15,840
we'd been able to see that the list of things I supposedly got wrong

225
00:15:15,840 --> 00:15:17,600
turned out to be errors on your part.

226
00:15:18,240 --> 00:15:23,520
Misquotes of what I said, claims that I didn't show things in my videos that in fact I did show,

227
00:15:23,520 --> 00:15:27,440
your misreading of scientific papers, and your misunderstanding of graphs.

228
00:15:27,440 --> 00:15:33,600
I do understand why you see citing sources and fact checking as punishment.

229
00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:38,080
It is a bit tedious, it takes more time, but it does expose errors.

230
00:15:38,720 --> 00:15:41,760
So please look on it as a positive, not a negative.

231
00:15:42,400 --> 00:15:46,560
You say that you don't have time to respond in this fact checking format,

232
00:15:46,560 --> 00:15:49,280
so why not take a few days to do it like I do?

233
00:15:49,920 --> 00:15:54,480
Instead of rushing out a video in a single day and getting your facts wrong,

234
00:15:54,480 --> 00:15:57,760
why not take the time to fact check the sources I give,

235
00:15:57,760 --> 00:16:01,520
and more importantly, take the time to find sources for your claims

236
00:16:01,520 --> 00:16:04,240
so that everyone watching can fact check them also?

237
00:16:04,880 --> 00:16:08,400
Hate to say it, but that is how science is done.
