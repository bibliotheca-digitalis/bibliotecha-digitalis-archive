0	4240	After my last video correcting Tony Heller's attempts at fact-checking,
4240	8400	his immediate response was, he really is a glutton for punishment.
8400	13520	But for me, fact-checking isn't a punishment at all. I welcome it, because I want to make my
13520	19680	videos as factually accurate as possible. If I've got something wrong, I want to know about it.
19680	25040	And if even the most determined attempt to find a fault in my videos can't find a single error,
25040	30480	that's even better. Since science is about facts rather than personal opinion,
30480	35680	I'm glad that through this video debate, which entails fact-checking and asking for sources,
35680	39200	people are beginning to see which claims are supported and which claims have been
39200	45920	shown to be wrong or are still unsupported. So let's just get up to speed. These are the
45920	51120	issues we've been discussing that have now been resolved. To read them, just pause the video.
51760	56400	And these are the ones Tony still disputes. So these are the ones I'll deal with in the
56400	61120	second round of this debate. Let's go through his second round video and look at the things
61120	72400	he still disputes. The first six minutes are filled with an explanation of who Milankovitch
72400	78160	was and why we get summers and winters. Then Tony read from an Indiana University website,
78160	83040	which explains what Milankovitch cycles are. All this can be found on Wikipedia,
83040	86080	so let's skip to the part where Tony disputes what I said.
86080	91680	It's of primary importance to explain that climate change and subsequent periods of glaciation
91680	97520	resulting from the following three variables is not due to the total amount of solar energy
97520	103520	reaching Earth. The three Milankovitch cycles impact the seasonality and location of solar
103520	108320	energy around the Earth, thus impacting contrasts between the seasons.
108960	113520	Let's look closely at his claim from the professional paper he cited.
113520	119120	The total insulation received by Earth has varied by less than 0.7 watts per meter.
119120	124400	But this is junk science. As I just pointed out from the Indiana University website,
124400	129440	total solar insulation is irrelevant. But the authors of the paper make exactly
129440	135440	the same point. The reason Tony calls it junk science is because he misread the paper.
135440	139920	The authors say exactly the same thing as the Indiana University website,
139920	144320	that the obliquity of the Earth's axis and the precession of the equinoxes
144320	148960	strongly affect the distribution of available energy between latitudes and seasons.
149600	154160	For example, the variation of the summer insulation at 65 degrees north.
154960	159120	But what they found is that even if you include the response of ice sheets,
159120	163680	which was Milankovitch's theory regarding the 65 degree north latitude,
163680	167120	that's still not enough feedback to explain the glacial cycles.
167920	172720	What may explain it, say the authors, is the data from recent ice core samples
172720	177440	showing a likely increase of CO2 and methane, which are powerful greenhouse gases.
178160	182240	They show their figures, they cite their sources, and their conclusions have since
182240	185680	been confirmed by other studies that I cited in my last video.
186560	189040	Just saying they're wrong is not much of an answer.
189680	193600	So Milankovitch's basic idea is accepted by researchers,
193600	197280	but like all theories, every detail is not carved in stone.
197840	202960	Since Milankovitch proposed it 90 odd years ago, researchers have been able to accurately
202960	208080	date these glacial cycles and discovered that Milankovitch cycles don't make a perfect fit.
208800	212320	Lots of new evidence has emerged in the last nine decades,
212320	216240	such as other orbital cycles, ice core data, and so on.
217040	220480	From this new data, researchers have calculated that changes in
220480	224320	insulation and the positive feedback of ice albedo alone
224320	227280	can't explain the advance and retreat of ice sheets.
227280	231200	Other feedback factors like carbon dioxide and methane have to be added.
232320	236080	And for all those who would much rather hear my personal theories, why?
236800	239840	Like Tony, I'm a complete amateur in this field.
239840	243920	If you want to know what amateurs believe, their theories are all over YouTube.
243920	248000	If you want to know what the scientific researchers found, well, this is it.
249840	254080	In my first video, I showed Potholer criticizing Al Gore.
254720	258400	My criticism of Potholer was centered around the fact that he just
258400	261120	blew off Al Gore as being someone irrelevant.
261120	263600	Actually, that's not what you said. You said this.
263600	268160	What he blew over in his discussion was that Al Gore said the exact opposite.
268160	271360	He tried to make it sound like CO2 drove the temperature.
271360	275520	And I answered that by showing how I didn't brush over it at all, clearly.
275520	279600	In his film An Inconvenient Truth, Al Gore used a graph like this to show
279600	283520	a correlation between carbon dioxide levels and increased temperatures.
284160	287360	But he obscured the fact that the carbon dioxide increases
287360	290400	lagged the temperature increases by 800 years.
290400	295280	So now that we're up to speed, let's deal with what Tony mistakenly thinks he said.
295280	297600	Did I assert that Al Gore is irrelevant?
298320	302480	As usual, Tony doesn't play a clip, so I'll just have to tell you what I think.
303200	307280	I think Al Gore's very relevant to the public perception of climate science
307280	311760	because he's a high profile figure and millions of people saw his movie.
311760	314880	And he's clearly relevant to people who believe whatever he says.
315440	317760	And that's why I corrected his claims.
318560	321520	But Gore is completely irrelevant in the science world
321520	326400	because he isn't a professional researcher in this field and he isn't publishing any studies.
327200	333040	So his claims should not be cited as scientific fact in newspapers or TV programs,
333040	336640	or be passed off as the conclusions of professional researchers.
337600	341760	By the way, I started making videos about climate science ten years ago,
341760	347600	and the very first one included a criticism of Al Gore's CO2 claim, which I just showed you.
348160	353440	The second one and the fourth one in the series also included corrections of his claims,
353440	354320	like this one.
354320	356400	If Greenland broke up and melted,
357360	362880	or if half of Greenland and half of West Antarctica broke up and melted,
362880	366000	this is what would happen to the sea level in Florida.
366560	372000	Well, yes, but it's rather like saying that if the Rockefeller Center turned into a banana split,
372000	374720	ice cream would melt all over Fifth Avenue.
374720	378000	The crucial question is, how likely is that to happen?
379360	383920	Let's look more closely at Al Gore's claim about a 20-foot rise in sea levels.
384560	387280	The important word here, of course, is if.
388000	389920	Gore isn't exactly lying.
389920	394640	If these ice sheets melted, then yes, we could get a 20-foot rise in sea levels,
394640	398160	although more recent research suggests the figure would be less.
398160	402080	But no climate scientist is saying it'll happen any time soon.
402080	405840	At current warming rates, the data show it'll take at least a thousand years
405840	408480	for the Greenland ice sheet to completely melt,
408480	412240	and thousands more for the West Antarctic ice sheet to melt.
412240	416400	So let's get back to the ever-shortening list of things I supposedly got wrong.
417120	420400	Now let's look at another appeal to authority by Potholer.
421280	425840	Potholer is describing a single very controversial paper by Shikun
425840	429360	as if that represented the opinion of the scientific community.
430240	433360	Many scientists have poked holes in Shikun's work,
433360	436640	and it's pretty much irrelevant to the discussion anyway.
436640	441040	Actually, those scientists Tony is talking about later retracted their criticisms
441040	444160	and agreed that the Shikun paper was correct after all.
445920	449040	To all those watching, is what I've just said true?
449040	449840	How do you know?
450560	454480	Unless I give you a source, in other words, show who these scientists are
454480	458400	and where they made this retraction, you have no way of fact-checking it.
459280	463120	I have no idea if it's true or even if these scientists exist,
463120	467760	because Tony hasn't given his source either, so I can't fact-check it.
468480	473600	This is why it's important to cite sources to allow people to fact-check assertions.
474320	477760	If many scientists have poked holes in the Shikun paper,
477760	481760	then they'll be in comment papers among the 658 citations
481760	484560	of Shikun's paper listed in the scientific literature.
485280	489040	So all Tony has to do is cite the titles, authors,
489040	493600	dates of publication and journals of these comment papers in his next response,
494160	497840	the same way I always cite my sources when I make a claim.
498800	500080	But let's step back a bit.
500720	504960	Tony calls my citing of this scientific study an appeal to authority.
505680	509280	As anyone who's ever studied graduate-level science knows,
509280	512720	citing peer-reviewed papers is standard practice in science.
513440	515360	Not doing so would get you an F.
516080	520880	And at the end of every scientific paper that's published is a list of citations,
520880	522880	because that's how science is done.
523680	526160	An appeal to authority is completely different.
526720	531200	It's insisting that a claim is true simply because a valid authority or
531200	535440	expert on the issue said it was true without any supporting evidence offered.
536160	541920	To give a real example, it's like saying Dr David Viner is a clever man with a PhD.
541920	546640	David Viner says there'll be no more snow in Britain, so there'll be no more snow in Britain.
547760	552640	Viner is indeed an authority, but he didn't publish or cite a peer-reviewed study
552640	554720	showing evidence to support that claim.
555360	558240	So that's what's known as an argument from authority.
559120	561840	The irony is that when Tony does give his sources,
562400	567280	they all take their data from peer-reviewed papers, even if he didn't realize it.
568400	570800	Let's move on to the next unresolved issue.
570800	575520	Anyway, his valid criticism was that I used a 10C change in temperature
575520	578720	for 100 parts per million change in CO2.
578720	582320	And his point was, yes, it was 10C change in Antarctica,
582320	584960	but that wasn't the change in global temperature.
585600	590000	Actually, my point was that Tony claimed I said that a 10 degree rise in temperature
590000	595120	was caused by a 100 degree rise in CO2, which he now accepts I didn't say.
595920	599840	And my other point was that it was Tony himself who came up with this figure
599840	604880	by getting a graph off the internet and not fact checking what the temperature data referred to.
605600	609600	So that led to his mistaken belief that these are global temperatures.
609600	613840	In fact, they're Antarctic temperatures, which he now accepts he got wrong.
614480	616720	This is the graph he was referring to.
616720	618880	It's not really very hard to find this graph.
618880	623040	It's the first thing that comes up when you type in Antarctic ice core graphs.
623840	626320	He tries to make it sound like I'm hiding something,
626320	629440	but this is just the standard data from the ice cores.
629600	632000	I just assumed that he knew how to use Google.
632000	635680	Tony's right in saying it's not hard to find this graph, as I showed.
636240	641120	What requires a bit more intelligence, or knowing how to use Google, as Tony puts it,
641120	644160	is finding out where this graph originated.
644160	646960	In my last video, I showed how I tracked it down.
647600	650000	When I got to the source data, I found that
650000	653200	Tony's assumption that these are global temperatures was wrong.
654080	656560	I'm not suggesting you're hiding anything, Tony.
656560	660480	I'm prepared to accept that you didn't know how to fact check this graph,
660480	663200	or didn't realize why fact checking is important.
663840	668240	But I hope you now do appreciate that by not tracking down the source of the data,
668240	670240	you made a mistake in interpreting it.
670240	673280	This graph is from the 1990 IPCC report,
673280	678160	and it shows about a 5C swing in temperature between ice ages and interglacials.
678160	681120	That's about half of what the Antarctic ice cores show.
682000	687280	Using even the highest estimates of climate sensitivity from the IPCC report,
687280	690720	you can only account for about 1C swing in temperature
690720	694320	from the 100 parts per million change in carbon dioxide.
694320	698720	So the vast majority of the change can't be due to carbon dioxide.
698720	700640	It has to be due to something else.
700640	703440	But as we've seen, it's not carbon dioxide alone.
704320	707520	But I'm glad that this time Tony's not claiming that I said that
707520	712320	five degrees of warming was caused by a 100 parts per million increase of CO2,
712320	713600	because of course I didn't.
714240	716640	I'm going to explain this again very simply,
716640	720320	and hopefully this time even Potholer will be able to understand.
720880	724800	Methane only has three small narrow spectral spikes,
724800	727280	and only two of any significance.
727280	731200	And both of these small narrow spectral spikes of methane
731200	736480	overlap with the very tall broad spectrum of water vapour.
736480	742400	Water vapour is a much more potent greenhouse gas than nearly irrelevant methane.
742400	746480	But all the measurements and studies show exactly how relevant methane is.
747040	749440	Repeating your unsubstantiated claim,
749440	753920	even when laced with sarcasm, is still just an unsubstantiated claim.
754880	758720	If science was just a question of saying you believe something isn't true,
758720	763040	I could just as easily say yes it is, and you could say no it's not.
763040	768080	I can say yes it is, and we can keep batting back and forth until one of us gives up.
769040	772720	I showed the actual figures for methane's radiative forcing,
772720	776640	the figures for its absorption wavelengths for infrared radiation,
776640	778640	the figures for its longevity,
778640	782000	and the figures for its comparative concentration in the atmosphere.
782720	785280	And I showed the sources of all these figures,
785280	789440	so if Tony thinks they're wrong it's no good just saying I think they're wrong,
789440	793040	he needs to cite studies that also show facts and figures.
793600	795920	Because that's how science is done.
796720	798160	And here's the kicker.
798160	802240	Even the Indiana University website that Tony used as a source
802240	804960	lists methane as a significant greenhouse gas.
806080	809600	If carbon dioxide feedback produced a gain of more than one,
809600	811520	it would become the driver of climate.
811520	815280	It would go out of control and you'd never be able to get out of an ice age.
815280	817040	Or when you started out of an ice age,
817040	819600	you'd never be able to stop and you'd end up like Venus.
819600	822160	Well I already explained this in my last video.
822720	827440	Not because this is my theory, but because this is what researchers have found.
827440	831440	Their conclusions are based on some fairly basic principles of physics.
831440	835360	Once again Tony's only response is to claim that he's right and they must all be wrong.
836000	838320	So that doesn't really advance things very far.
838320	841840	If he can come up with a study that says we should have had runaway warming
841840	845200	and the oceans should have boiled, then I'll be very glad to look at it.
845840	848400	So where do we now stand on the remaining issues?
848960	852640	Forcing duty CO2 and methane did not contribute to Glaze Hill cycles.
852640	857680	Well, the paper that Tony said was junk science was the result of him misreading it.
857680	860000	All the scientific studies I've cited,
860000	863600	even the source of one of the graphs Tony cited, say they did.
864480	869360	Tony's argument that this wasn't part of Milankovitch's theory over 90 years ago
869360	874160	is very interesting history, but researchers have discovered a lot more since then.
874560	879440	His claim that I blew over Al Gore's misleading speech about CO2 correlation,
879440	882080	as we've seen for the second time, I didn't.
883200	885840	Methane is not a significant greenhouse gas.
885840	889520	Again, all the scientific studies I've cited show otherwise,
889520	893520	and the authors of these studies have measurements and figures to back that up.
893920	896880	Tony hasn't cited any studies that contradict this.
898000	902080	Tony, you're now suggesting you want to end this online fact checking debate
902880	905440	about the things I supposedly got wrong,
905440	908800	which of course is your prerogative because you began it.
908800	912080	I'm very glad that by digging up sources and fact checking,
912080	915840	we'd been able to see that the list of things I supposedly got wrong
915840	917600	turned out to be errors on your part.
918240	923520	Misquotes of what I said, claims that I didn't show things in my videos that in fact I did show,
923520	927440	your misreading of scientific papers, and your misunderstanding of graphs.
927440	933600	I do understand why you see citing sources and fact checking as punishment.
933600	938080	It is a bit tedious, it takes more time, but it does expose errors.
938720	941760	So please look on it as a positive, not a negative.
942400	946560	You say that you don't have time to respond in this fact checking format,
946560	949280	so why not take a few days to do it like I do?
949920	954480	Instead of rushing out a video in a single day and getting your facts wrong,
954480	957760	why not take the time to fact check the sources I give,
957760	961520	and more importantly, take the time to find sources for your claims
961520	964240	so that everyone watching can fact check them also?
964880	968400	Hate to say it, but that is how science is done.
