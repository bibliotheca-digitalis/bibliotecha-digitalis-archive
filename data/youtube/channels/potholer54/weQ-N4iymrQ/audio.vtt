00:00.000 --> 00:04.240
After my last video correcting Tony Heller's attempts at fact-checking,

00:04.240 --> 00:08.400
his immediate response was, he really is a glutton for punishment.

00:08.400 --> 00:13.520
But for me, fact-checking isn't a punishment at all. I welcome it, because I want to make my

00:13.520 --> 00:19.680
videos as factually accurate as possible. If I've got something wrong, I want to know about it.

00:19.680 --> 00:25.040
And if even the most determined attempt to find a fault in my videos can't find a single error,

00:25.040 --> 00:30.480
that's even better. Since science is about facts rather than personal opinion,

00:30.480 --> 00:35.680
I'm glad that through this video debate, which entails fact-checking and asking for sources,

00:35.680 --> 00:39.200
people are beginning to see which claims are supported and which claims have been

00:39.200 --> 00:45.920
shown to be wrong or are still unsupported. So let's just get up to speed. These are the

00:45.920 --> 00:51.120
issues we've been discussing that have now been resolved. To read them, just pause the video.

00:51.760 --> 00:56.400
And these are the ones Tony still disputes. So these are the ones I'll deal with in the

00:56.400 --> 01:01.120
second round of this debate. Let's go through his second round video and look at the things

01:01.120 --> 01:12.400
he still disputes. The first six minutes are filled with an explanation of who Milankovitch

01:12.400 --> 01:18.160
was and why we get summers and winters. Then Tony read from an Indiana University website,

01:18.160 --> 01:23.040
which explains what Milankovitch cycles are. All this can be found on Wikipedia,

01:23.040 --> 01:26.080
so let's skip to the part where Tony disputes what I said.

01:26.080 --> 01:31.680
It's of primary importance to explain that climate change and subsequent periods of glaciation

01:31.680 --> 01:37.520
resulting from the following three variables is not due to the total amount of solar energy

01:37.520 --> 01:43.520
reaching Earth. The three Milankovitch cycles impact the seasonality and location of solar

01:43.520 --> 01:48.320
energy around the Earth, thus impacting contrasts between the seasons.

01:48.960 --> 01:53.520
Let's look closely at his claim from the professional paper he cited.

01:53.520 --> 01:59.120
The total insulation received by Earth has varied by less than 0.7 watts per meter.

01:59.120 --> 02:04.400
But this is junk science. As I just pointed out from the Indiana University website,

02:04.400 --> 02:09.440
total solar insulation is irrelevant. But the authors of the paper make exactly

02:09.440 --> 02:15.440
the same point. The reason Tony calls it junk science is because he misread the paper.

02:15.440 --> 02:19.920
The authors say exactly the same thing as the Indiana University website,

02:19.920 --> 02:24.320
that the obliquity of the Earth's axis and the precession of the equinoxes

02:24.320 --> 02:28.960
strongly affect the distribution of available energy between latitudes and seasons.

02:29.600 --> 02:34.160
For example, the variation of the summer insulation at 65 degrees north.

02:34.960 --> 02:39.120
But what they found is that even if you include the response of ice sheets,

02:39.120 --> 02:43.680
which was Milankovitch's theory regarding the 65 degree north latitude,

02:43.680 --> 02:47.120
that's still not enough feedback to explain the glacial cycles.

02:47.920 --> 02:52.720
What may explain it, say the authors, is the data from recent ice core samples

02:52.720 --> 02:57.440
showing a likely increase of CO2 and methane, which are powerful greenhouse gases.

02:58.160 --> 03:02.240
They show their figures, they cite their sources, and their conclusions have since

03:02.240 --> 03:05.680
been confirmed by other studies that I cited in my last video.

03:06.560 --> 03:09.040
Just saying they're wrong is not much of an answer.

03:09.680 --> 03:13.600
So Milankovitch's basic idea is accepted by researchers,

03:13.600 --> 03:17.280
but like all theories, every detail is not carved in stone.

03:17.840 --> 03:22.960
Since Milankovitch proposed it 90 odd years ago, researchers have been able to accurately

03:22.960 --> 03:28.080
date these glacial cycles and discovered that Milankovitch cycles don't make a perfect fit.

03:28.800 --> 03:32.320
Lots of new evidence has emerged in the last nine decades,

03:32.320 --> 03:36.240
such as other orbital cycles, ice core data, and so on.

03:37.040 --> 03:40.480
From this new data, researchers have calculated that changes in

03:40.480 --> 03:44.320
insulation and the positive feedback of ice albedo alone

03:44.320 --> 03:47.280
can't explain the advance and retreat of ice sheets.

03:47.280 --> 03:51.200
Other feedback factors like carbon dioxide and methane have to be added.

03:52.320 --> 03:56.080
And for all those who would much rather hear my personal theories, why?

03:56.800 --> 03:59.840
Like Tony, I'm a complete amateur in this field.

03:59.840 --> 04:03.920
If you want to know what amateurs believe, their theories are all over YouTube.

04:03.920 --> 04:08.000
If you want to know what the scientific researchers found, well, this is it.

04:09.840 --> 04:14.080
In my first video, I showed Potholer criticizing Al Gore.

04:14.720 --> 04:18.400
My criticism of Potholer was centered around the fact that he just

04:18.400 --> 04:21.120
blew off Al Gore as being someone irrelevant.

04:21.120 --> 04:23.600
Actually, that's not what you said. You said this.

04:23.600 --> 04:28.160
What he blew over in his discussion was that Al Gore said the exact opposite.

04:28.160 --> 04:31.360
He tried to make it sound like CO2 drove the temperature.

04:31.360 --> 04:35.520
And I answered that by showing how I didn't brush over it at all, clearly.

04:35.520 --> 04:39.600
In his film An Inconvenient Truth, Al Gore used a graph like this to show

04:39.600 --> 04:43.520
a correlation between carbon dioxide levels and increased temperatures.

04:44.160 --> 04:47.360
But he obscured the fact that the carbon dioxide increases

04:47.360 --> 04:50.400
lagged the temperature increases by 800 years.

04:50.400 --> 04:55.280
So now that we're up to speed, let's deal with what Tony mistakenly thinks he said.

04:55.280 --> 04:57.600
Did I assert that Al Gore is irrelevant?

04:58.320 --> 05:02.480
As usual, Tony doesn't play a clip, so I'll just have to tell you what I think.

05:03.200 --> 05:07.280
I think Al Gore's very relevant to the public perception of climate science

05:07.280 --> 05:11.760
because he's a high profile figure and millions of people saw his movie.

05:11.760 --> 05:14.880
And he's clearly relevant to people who believe whatever he says.

05:15.440 --> 05:17.760
And that's why I corrected his claims.

05:18.560 --> 05:21.520
But Gore is completely irrelevant in the science world

05:21.520 --> 05:26.400
because he isn't a professional researcher in this field and he isn't publishing any studies.

05:27.200 --> 05:33.040
So his claims should not be cited as scientific fact in newspapers or TV programs,

05:33.040 --> 05:36.640
or be passed off as the conclusions of professional researchers.

05:37.600 --> 05:41.760
By the way, I started making videos about climate science ten years ago,

05:41.760 --> 05:47.600
and the very first one included a criticism of Al Gore's CO2 claim, which I just showed you.

05:48.160 --> 05:53.440
The second one and the fourth one in the series also included corrections of his claims,

05:53.440 --> 05:54.320
like this one.

05:54.320 --> 05:56.400
If Greenland broke up and melted,

05:57.360 --> 06:02.880
or if half of Greenland and half of West Antarctica broke up and melted,

06:02.880 --> 06:06.000
this is what would happen to the sea level in Florida.

06:06.560 --> 06:12.000
Well, yes, but it's rather like saying that if the Rockefeller Center turned into a banana split,

06:12.000 --> 06:14.720
ice cream would melt all over Fifth Avenue.

06:14.720 --> 06:18.000
The crucial question is, how likely is that to happen?

06:19.360 --> 06:23.920
Let's look more closely at Al Gore's claim about a 20-foot rise in sea levels.

06:24.560 --> 06:27.280
The important word here, of course, is if.

06:28.000 --> 06:29.920
Gore isn't exactly lying.

06:29.920 --> 06:34.640
If these ice sheets melted, then yes, we could get a 20-foot rise in sea levels,

06:34.640 --> 06:38.160
although more recent research suggests the figure would be less.

06:38.160 --> 06:42.080
But no climate scientist is saying it'll happen any time soon.

06:42.080 --> 06:45.840
At current warming rates, the data show it'll take at least a thousand years

06:45.840 --> 06:48.480
for the Greenland ice sheet to completely melt,

06:48.480 --> 06:52.240
and thousands more for the West Antarctic ice sheet to melt.

06:52.240 --> 06:56.400
So let's get back to the ever-shortening list of things I supposedly got wrong.

06:57.120 --> 07:00.400
Now let's look at another appeal to authority by Potholer.

07:01.280 --> 07:05.840
Potholer is describing a single very controversial paper by Shikun

07:05.840 --> 07:09.360
as if that represented the opinion of the scientific community.

07:10.240 --> 07:13.360
Many scientists have poked holes in Shikun's work,

07:13.360 --> 07:16.640
and it's pretty much irrelevant to the discussion anyway.

07:16.640 --> 07:21.040
Actually, those scientists Tony is talking about later retracted their criticisms

07:21.040 --> 07:24.160
and agreed that the Shikun paper was correct after all.

07:25.920 --> 07:29.040
To all those watching, is what I've just said true?

07:29.040 --> 07:29.840
How do you know?

07:30.560 --> 07:34.480
Unless I give you a source, in other words, show who these scientists are

07:34.480 --> 07:38.400
and where they made this retraction, you have no way of fact-checking it.

07:39.280 --> 07:43.120
I have no idea if it's true or even if these scientists exist,

07:43.120 --> 07:47.760
because Tony hasn't given his source either, so I can't fact-check it.

07:48.480 --> 07:53.600
This is why it's important to cite sources to allow people to fact-check assertions.

07:54.320 --> 07:57.760
If many scientists have poked holes in the Shikun paper,

07:57.760 --> 08:01.760
then they'll be in comment papers among the 658 citations

08:01.760 --> 08:04.560
of Shikun's paper listed in the scientific literature.

08:05.280 --> 08:09.040
So all Tony has to do is cite the titles, authors,

08:09.040 --> 08:13.600
dates of publication and journals of these comment papers in his next response,

08:14.160 --> 08:17.840
the same way I always cite my sources when I make a claim.

08:18.800 --> 08:20.080
But let's step back a bit.

08:20.720 --> 08:24.960
Tony calls my citing of this scientific study an appeal to authority.

08:25.680 --> 08:29.280
As anyone who's ever studied graduate-level science knows,

08:29.280 --> 08:32.720
citing peer-reviewed papers is standard practice in science.

08:33.440 --> 08:35.360
Not doing so would get you an F.

08:36.080 --> 08:40.880
And at the end of every scientific paper that's published is a list of citations,

08:40.880 --> 08:42.880
because that's how science is done.

08:43.680 --> 08:46.160
An appeal to authority is completely different.

08:46.720 --> 08:51.200
It's insisting that a claim is true simply because a valid authority or

08:51.200 --> 08:55.440
expert on the issue said it was true without any supporting evidence offered.

08:56.160 --> 09:01.920
To give a real example, it's like saying Dr David Viner is a clever man with a PhD.

09:01.920 --> 09:06.640
David Viner says there'll be no more snow in Britain, so there'll be no more snow in Britain.

09:07.760 --> 09:12.640
Viner is indeed an authority, but he didn't publish or cite a peer-reviewed study

09:12.640 --> 09:14.720
showing evidence to support that claim.

09:15.360 --> 09:18.240
So that's what's known as an argument from authority.

09:19.120 --> 09:21.840
The irony is that when Tony does give his sources,

09:22.400 --> 09:27.280
they all take their data from peer-reviewed papers, even if he didn't realize it.

09:28.400 --> 09:30.800
Let's move on to the next unresolved issue.

09:30.800 --> 09:35.520
Anyway, his valid criticism was that I used a 10C change in temperature

09:35.520 --> 09:38.720
for 100 parts per million change in CO2.

09:38.720 --> 09:42.320
And his point was, yes, it was 10C change in Antarctica,

09:42.320 --> 09:44.960
but that wasn't the change in global temperature.

09:45.600 --> 09:50.000
Actually, my point was that Tony claimed I said that a 10 degree rise in temperature

09:50.000 --> 09:55.120
was caused by a 100 degree rise in CO2, which he now accepts I didn't say.

09:55.920 --> 09:59.840
And my other point was that it was Tony himself who came up with this figure

09:59.840 --> 10:04.880
by getting a graph off the internet and not fact checking what the temperature data referred to.

10:05.600 --> 10:09.600
So that led to his mistaken belief that these are global temperatures.

10:09.600 --> 10:13.840
In fact, they're Antarctic temperatures, which he now accepts he got wrong.

10:14.480 --> 10:16.720
This is the graph he was referring to.

10:16.720 --> 10:18.880
It's not really very hard to find this graph.

10:18.880 --> 10:23.040
It's the first thing that comes up when you type in Antarctic ice core graphs.

10:23.840 --> 10:26.320
He tries to make it sound like I'm hiding something,

10:26.320 --> 10:29.440
but this is just the standard data from the ice cores.

10:29.600 --> 10:32.000
I just assumed that he knew how to use Google.

10:32.000 --> 10:35.680
Tony's right in saying it's not hard to find this graph, as I showed.

10:36.240 --> 10:41.120
What requires a bit more intelligence, or knowing how to use Google, as Tony puts it,

10:41.120 --> 10:44.160
is finding out where this graph originated.

10:44.160 --> 10:46.960
In my last video, I showed how I tracked it down.

10:47.600 --> 10:50.000
When I got to the source data, I found that

10:50.000 --> 10:53.200
Tony's assumption that these are global temperatures was wrong.

10:54.080 --> 10:56.560
I'm not suggesting you're hiding anything, Tony.

10:56.560 --> 11:00.480
I'm prepared to accept that you didn't know how to fact check this graph,

11:00.480 --> 11:03.200
or didn't realize why fact checking is important.

11:03.840 --> 11:08.240
But I hope you now do appreciate that by not tracking down the source of the data,

11:08.240 --> 11:10.240
you made a mistake in interpreting it.

11:10.240 --> 11:13.280
This graph is from the 1990 IPCC report,

11:13.280 --> 11:18.160
and it shows about a 5C swing in temperature between ice ages and interglacials.

11:18.160 --> 11:21.120
That's about half of what the Antarctic ice cores show.

11:22.000 --> 11:27.280
Using even the highest estimates of climate sensitivity from the IPCC report,

11:27.280 --> 11:30.720
you can only account for about 1C swing in temperature

11:30.720 --> 11:34.320
from the 100 parts per million change in carbon dioxide.

11:34.320 --> 11:38.720
So the vast majority of the change can't be due to carbon dioxide.

11:38.720 --> 11:40.640
It has to be due to something else.

11:40.640 --> 11:43.440
But as we've seen, it's not carbon dioxide alone.

11:44.320 --> 11:47.520
But I'm glad that this time Tony's not claiming that I said that

11:47.520 --> 11:52.320
five degrees of warming was caused by a 100 parts per million increase of CO2,

11:52.320 --> 11:53.600
because of course I didn't.

11:54.240 --> 11:56.640
I'm going to explain this again very simply,

11:56.640 --> 12:00.320
and hopefully this time even Potholer will be able to understand.

12:00.880 --> 12:04.800
Methane only has three small narrow spectral spikes,

12:04.800 --> 12:07.280
and only two of any significance.

12:07.280 --> 12:11.200
And both of these small narrow spectral spikes of methane

12:11.200 --> 12:16.480
overlap with the very tall broad spectrum of water vapour.

12:16.480 --> 12:22.400
Water vapour is a much more potent greenhouse gas than nearly irrelevant methane.

12:22.400 --> 12:26.480
But all the measurements and studies show exactly how relevant methane is.

12:27.040 --> 12:29.440
Repeating your unsubstantiated claim,

12:29.440 --> 12:33.920
even when laced with sarcasm, is still just an unsubstantiated claim.

12:34.880 --> 12:38.720
If science was just a question of saying you believe something isn't true,

12:38.720 --> 12:43.040
I could just as easily say yes it is, and you could say no it's not.

12:43.040 --> 12:48.080
I can say yes it is, and we can keep batting back and forth until one of us gives up.

12:49.040 --> 12:52.720
I showed the actual figures for methane's radiative forcing,

12:52.720 --> 12:56.640
the figures for its absorption wavelengths for infrared radiation,

12:56.640 --> 12:58.640
the figures for its longevity,

12:58.640 --> 13:02.000
and the figures for its comparative concentration in the atmosphere.

13:02.720 --> 13:05.280
And I showed the sources of all these figures,

13:05.280 --> 13:09.440
so if Tony thinks they're wrong it's no good just saying I think they're wrong,

13:09.440 --> 13:13.040
he needs to cite studies that also show facts and figures.

13:13.600 --> 13:15.920
Because that's how science is done.

13:16.720 --> 13:18.160
And here's the kicker.

13:18.160 --> 13:22.240
Even the Indiana University website that Tony used as a source

13:22.240 --> 13:24.960
lists methane as a significant greenhouse gas.

13:26.080 --> 13:29.600
If carbon dioxide feedback produced a gain of more than one,

13:29.600 --> 13:31.520
it would become the driver of climate.

13:31.520 --> 13:35.280
It would go out of control and you'd never be able to get out of an ice age.

13:35.280 --> 13:37.040
Or when you started out of an ice age,

13:37.040 --> 13:39.600
you'd never be able to stop and you'd end up like Venus.

13:39.600 --> 13:42.160
Well I already explained this in my last video.

13:42.720 --> 13:47.440
Not because this is my theory, but because this is what researchers have found.

13:47.440 --> 13:51.440
Their conclusions are based on some fairly basic principles of physics.

13:51.440 --> 13:55.360
Once again Tony's only response is to claim that he's right and they must all be wrong.

13:56.000 --> 13:58.320
So that doesn't really advance things very far.

13:58.320 --> 14:01.840
If he can come up with a study that says we should have had runaway warming

14:01.840 --> 14:05.200
and the oceans should have boiled, then I'll be very glad to look at it.

14:05.840 --> 14:08.400
So where do we now stand on the remaining issues?

14:08.960 --> 14:12.640
Forcing duty CO2 and methane did not contribute to Glaze Hill cycles.

14:12.640 --> 14:17.680
Well, the paper that Tony said was junk science was the result of him misreading it.

14:17.680 --> 14:20.000
All the scientific studies I've cited,

14:20.000 --> 14:23.600
even the source of one of the graphs Tony cited, say they did.

14:24.480 --> 14:29.360
Tony's argument that this wasn't part of Milankovitch's theory over 90 years ago

14:29.360 --> 14:34.160
is very interesting history, but researchers have discovered a lot more since then.

14:34.560 --> 14:39.440
His claim that I blew over Al Gore's misleading speech about CO2 correlation,

14:39.440 --> 14:42.080
as we've seen for the second time, I didn't.

14:43.200 --> 14:45.840
Methane is not a significant greenhouse gas.

14:45.840 --> 14:49.520
Again, all the scientific studies I've cited show otherwise,

14:49.520 --> 14:53.520
and the authors of these studies have measurements and figures to back that up.

14:53.920 --> 14:56.880
Tony hasn't cited any studies that contradict this.

14:58.000 --> 15:02.080
Tony, you're now suggesting you want to end this online fact checking debate

15:02.880 --> 15:05.440
about the things I supposedly got wrong,

15:05.440 --> 15:08.800
which of course is your prerogative because you began it.

15:08.800 --> 15:12.080
I'm very glad that by digging up sources and fact checking,

15:12.080 --> 15:15.840
we'd been able to see that the list of things I supposedly got wrong

15:15.840 --> 15:17.600
turned out to be errors on your part.

15:18.240 --> 15:23.520
Misquotes of what I said, claims that I didn't show things in my videos that in fact I did show,

15:23.520 --> 15:27.440
your misreading of scientific papers, and your misunderstanding of graphs.

15:27.440 --> 15:33.600
I do understand why you see citing sources and fact checking as punishment.

15:33.600 --> 15:38.080
It is a bit tedious, it takes more time, but it does expose errors.

15:38.720 --> 15:41.760
So please look on it as a positive, not a negative.

15:42.400 --> 15:46.560
You say that you don't have time to respond in this fact checking format,

15:46.560 --> 15:49.280
so why not take a few days to do it like I do?

15:49.920 --> 15:54.480
Instead of rushing out a video in a single day and getting your facts wrong,

15:54.480 --> 15:57.760
why not take the time to fact check the sources I give,

15:57.760 --> 16:01.520
and more importantly, take the time to find sources for your claims

16:01.520 --> 16:04.240
so that everyone watching can fact check them also?

16:04.880 --> 16:08.400
Hate to say it, but that is how science is done.
