0	15760	Wacky Religious News, Stateline Saudi Arabia
15760	16760	This just in!
16760	21600	A girls' school in Saudi Arabia has defied a religious ban on female sports by erecting
21600	26880	basketball hoops and letting pupils play at break time, the Daily Al-Wattan reported on
26880	28360	Wednesday.
28400	32240	Several clerics in the conservative Islamic Kingdom have long spoken against allowing
32240	37600	women to play sports, with one senior figure saying in 2009 it might lead them to lose
37600	40520	their virginity by tearing their hymens.
40520	43680	Well, yeah, this just in, clerics!
43680	46760	You don't lose your virginity by playing sports.
46760	51140	If that was possible, I would have had a much easier adolescence, and a lot of teen movies
51140	53360	would have had no storyline.
53360	57600	Now I don't know if playing sports does cause girls to tear their hymens, although as Dave
57600	62640	Barry would say, the torn hymens would be a great name for a female rock band.
62640	66440	But even if it did, that's not the same as having sex.
66440	70900	The only way a girl could lose her virginity playing basketball is if the girls' team happens
70900	75140	to play a boys' team, and one of the girls lands on an erect penis when she comes down
75140	76640	from a dunk.
76640	79740	So these girls are still virgins, get it?
79740	83880	This sounds less like a concern about the sanctity of the hymen, and more a worry about
83880	88480	allowing Muslim schoolgirls to actually do something meaningful with their lives, even
88480	93040	if it's just to throw a ball through a hoop during break time.
93040	98140	And this just in, the Jerusalem Post reports that several religious soldiers requested
98140	103000	last week to wear earplugs or listen to MP3 players during a Holocaust Remembrance Day
103000	108200	ceremony in which women were singing, as well as for upcoming ceremonies for Remembrance
108200	110200	Day and Independence Day.
110240	115040	For those not well versed in archaic Jewish law, the Post tells us it generally prohibits
115040	118440	men from listening to women singing in person.
118440	119640	In person?
119640	126660	So it's okay if an Orthodox Jew listens to a woman singing on a CD, or on the radio.
126660	130320	But if he's listening on the radio and he's approaching the radio station, and he goes
130320	134160	inside and happens to catch a glimpse of the woman who's singing the song he's listening
134160	137920	to on the radio, then that's not okay.
137920	141520	And what if he's going into the radio station listening to the radio, and he doesn't actually
141520	146760	look at the window into the recording booth, but he happens to look away and catch a glimpse
146760	152080	of the recording artist through a reflection in a glass door that's being opened?
152080	155320	This seems to be a law with a lot of fuzzy areas.
155320	160560	Now I'd hate anyone to spoil this wonderful archaic rule, but wouldn't it be, well, terrible
160560	165900	if the next time you ladies are walking down the street and spot an Orthodox Jewish gentleman,
165900	167560	you burst into song?
167560	172720	I certainly wouldn't condone such a despicable breach of religious taboo.
