Wacky Religious News, Stateline Saudi Arabia

00:15.760 --> 00:16.760
This just in!

00:16.760 --> 00:21.600
A girls' school in Saudi Arabia has defied a religious ban on female sports by erecting

00:21.600 --> 00:26.880
basketball hoops and letting pupils play at break time, the Daily Al-Wattan reported on

00:26.880 --> 00:28.360
Wednesday.

00:28.400 --> 00:32.240
Several clerics in the conservative Islamic Kingdom have long spoken against allowing

00:32.240 --> 00:37.600
women to play sports, with one senior figure saying in 2009 it might lead them to lose

00:37.600 --> 00:40.520
their virginity by tearing their hymens.

00:40.520 --> 00:43.680
Well, yeah, this just in, clerics!

00:43.680 --> 00:46.760
You don't lose your virginity by playing sports.

00:46.760 --> 00:51.140
If that was possible, I would have had a much easier adolescence, and a lot of teen movies

00:51.140 --> 00:53.360
would have had no storyline.

00:53.360 --> 00:57.600
Now I don't know if playing sports does cause girls to tear their hymens, although as Dave

00:57.600 --> 01:02.640
Barry would say, the torn hymens would be a great name for a female rock band.

01:02.640 --> 01:06.440
But even if it did, that's not the same as having sex.

01:06.440 --> 01:10.900
The only way a girl could lose her virginity playing basketball is if the girls' team happens

01:10.900 --> 01:15.140
to play a boys' team, and one of the girls lands on an erect penis when she comes down

01:15.140 --> 01:16.640
from a dunk.

01:16.640 --> 01:19.740
So these girls are still virgins, get it?

01:19.740 --> 01:23.880
This sounds less like a concern about the sanctity of the hymen, and more a worry about

01:23.880 --> 01:28.480
allowing Muslim schoolgirls to actually do something meaningful with their lives, even

01:28.480 --> 01:33.040
if it's just to throw a ball through a hoop during break time.

01:33.040 --> 01:38.140
And this just in, the Jerusalem Post reports that several religious soldiers requested

01:38.140 --> 01:43.000
last week to wear earplugs or listen to MP3 players during a Holocaust Remembrance Day

01:43.000 --> 01:48.200
ceremony in which women were singing, as well as for upcoming ceremonies for Remembrance

01:48.200 --> 01:50.200
Day and Independence Day.

01:50.240 --> 01:55.040
For those not well versed in archaic Jewish law, the Post tells us it generally prohibits

01:55.040 --> 01:58.440
men from listening to women singing in person.

01:58.440 --> 01:59.640
In person?

01:59.640 --> 02:06.660
So it's okay if an Orthodox Jew listens to a woman singing on a CD, or on the radio.

02:06.660 --> 02:10.320
But if he's listening on the radio and he's approaching the radio station, and he goes

02:10.320 --> 02:14.160
inside and happens to catch a glimpse of the woman who's singing the song he's listening

02:14.160 --> 02:17.920
to on the radio, then that's not okay.

02:17.920 --> 02:21.520
And what if he's going into the radio station listening to the radio, and he doesn't actually

02:21.520 --> 02:26.760
look at the window into the recording booth, but he happens to look away and catch a glimpse

02:26.760 --> 02:32.080
of the recording artist through a reflection in a glass door that's being opened?

02:32.080 --> 02:35.320
This seems to be a law with a lot of fuzzy areas.

02:35.320 --> 02:40.560
Now I'd hate anyone to spoil this wonderful archaic rule, but wouldn't it be, well, terrible

02:40.560 --> 02:45.900
if the next time you ladies are walking down the street and spot an Orthodox Jewish gentleman,

02:45.900 --> 02:47.560
you burst into song?

02:47.560 --> 02:52.720
I certainly wouldn't condone such a despicable breach of religious taboo.

02:52.720 --> 02:54.880
