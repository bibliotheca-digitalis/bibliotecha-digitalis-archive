Wacky Religious News, Stateline Saudi Arabia

2
00:00:15,760 --> 00:00:16,760
This just in!

3
00:00:16,760 --> 00:00:21,600
A girls' school in Saudi Arabia has defied a religious ban on female sports by erecting

4
00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:26,880
basketball hoops and letting pupils play at break time, the Daily Al-Wattan reported on

5
00:00:26,880 --> 00:00:28,360
Wednesday.

6
00:00:28,400 --> 00:00:32,240
Several clerics in the conservative Islamic Kingdom have long spoken against allowing

7
00:00:32,240 --> 00:00:37,600
women to play sports, with one senior figure saying in 2009 it might lead them to lose

8
00:00:37,600 --> 00:00:40,520
their virginity by tearing their hymens.

9
00:00:40,520 --> 00:00:43,680
Well, yeah, this just in, clerics!

10
00:00:43,680 --> 00:00:46,760
You don't lose your virginity by playing sports.

11
00:00:46,760 --> 00:00:51,140
If that was possible, I would have had a much easier adolescence, and a lot of teen movies

12
00:00:51,140 --> 00:00:53,360
would have had no storyline.

13
00:00:53,360 --> 00:00:57,600
Now I don't know if playing sports does cause girls to tear their hymens, although as Dave

14
00:00:57,600 --> 00:01:02,640
Barry would say, the torn hymens would be a great name for a female rock band.

15
00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:06,440
But even if it did, that's not the same as having sex.

16
00:01:06,440 --> 00:01:10,900
The only way a girl could lose her virginity playing basketball is if the girls' team happens

17
00:01:10,900 --> 00:01:15,140
to play a boys' team, and one of the girls lands on an erect penis when she comes down

18
00:01:15,140 --> 00:01:16,640
from a dunk.

19
00:01:16,640 --> 00:01:19,740
So these girls are still virgins, get it?

20
00:01:19,740 --> 00:01:23,880
This sounds less like a concern about the sanctity of the hymen, and more a worry about

21
00:01:23,880 --> 00:01:28,480
allowing Muslim schoolgirls to actually do something meaningful with their lives, even

22
00:01:28,480 --> 00:01:33,040
if it's just to throw a ball through a hoop during break time.

23
00:01:33,040 --> 00:01:38,140
And this just in, the Jerusalem Post reports that several religious soldiers requested

24
00:01:38,140 --> 00:01:43,000
last week to wear earplugs or listen to MP3 players during a Holocaust Remembrance Day

25
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:48,200
ceremony in which women were singing, as well as for upcoming ceremonies for Remembrance

26
00:01:48,200 --> 00:01:50,200
Day and Independence Day.

27
00:01:50,240 --> 00:01:55,040
For those not well versed in archaic Jewish law, the Post tells us it generally prohibits

28
00:01:55,040 --> 00:01:58,440
men from listening to women singing in person.

29
00:01:58,440 --> 00:01:59,640
In person?

30
00:01:59,640 --> 00:02:06,660
So it's okay if an Orthodox Jew listens to a woman singing on a CD, or on the radio.

31
00:02:06,660 --> 00:02:10,320
But if he's listening on the radio and he's approaching the radio station, and he goes

32
00:02:10,320 --> 00:02:14,160
inside and happens to catch a glimpse of the woman who's singing the song he's listening

33
00:02:14,160 --> 00:02:17,920
to on the radio, then that's not okay.

34
00:02:17,920 --> 00:02:21,520
And what if he's going into the radio station listening to the radio, and he doesn't actually

35
00:02:21,520 --> 00:02:26,760
look at the window into the recording booth, but he happens to look away and catch a glimpse

36
00:02:26,760 --> 00:02:32,080
of the recording artist through a reflection in a glass door that's being opened?

37
00:02:32,080 --> 00:02:35,320
This seems to be a law with a lot of fuzzy areas.

38
00:02:35,320 --> 00:02:40,560
Now I'd hate anyone to spoil this wonderful archaic rule, but wouldn't it be, well, terrible

39
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:45,900
if the next time you ladies are walking down the street and spot an Orthodox Jewish gentleman,

40
00:02:45,900 --> 00:02:47,560
you burst into song?

41
00:02:47,560 --> 00:02:52,720
I certainly wouldn't condone such a despicable breach of religious taboo.

42
00:02:52,720 --> 00:02:54,880
