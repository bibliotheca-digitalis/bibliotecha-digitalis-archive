00:00.000 --> 00:06.000
I was asked recently why I wasn't going to take up Christopher Monkton's invitation to a public debate.

00:06.000 --> 00:08.000
Well, there's a very good reason.

00:08.000 --> 00:11.000
Monkton hasn't invited me to one.

00:11.000 --> 00:17.000
It turns out that this can be traced back to yet another piece of fiction published on the What's Up With That website.

00:17.000 --> 00:24.000
Further references to Peter Hadfield, who will not engage in a face-to-face debate in a neutral venue, will be deleted.

00:24.000 --> 00:32.000
The claim that I refuse to debate Christopher Monkton comes on top of made-up quotes attributed to me by the guy who runs the channel, Anthony Watts.

00:32.000 --> 00:40.000
So in order to correct this latest piece of misinformation, I sent the following message to the same comments forum where it appeared.

00:40.000 --> 00:50.000
The message basically says what I've just told you, that I haven't received an invitation, I haven't declined one, and that I'd be delighted to show him all my documentary evidence face-to-face.

00:50.000 --> 00:53.000
Not surprisingly, the message didn't appear.

00:53.000 --> 00:59.000
A few days later, I tried again, this time addressing the moderator, DBS, and ending with,

00:59.000 --> 01:03.000
Please publish this so that people are not misled by your erroneous claim.

01:03.000 --> 01:05.000
It still didn't appear.

01:05.000 --> 01:10.000
So I emailed Anthony Watts, asking him to correct the error. No response.

01:10.000 --> 01:15.000
I have no idea why Anthony has taken such an intense dislike to me.

01:15.000 --> 01:18.000
Yes, me. Can you imagine that?

01:18.000 --> 01:21.000
Now he's even banned anyone from mentioning me.

01:21.000 --> 01:29.000
Although that rule doesn't seem to apply if you want to add to the fictitious claim that I won't debate Monkton, or if you want to criticise me in general.

01:29.000 --> 01:33.000
I don't know exactly what I've done to deserve all this acrimony.

01:33.000 --> 01:38.000
Why are you doing this?

01:38.000 --> 01:48.000
I've been polite in all my exchanges, and even my rebuttal to Monkton on what's up with that doggedly stuck to the facts and cited evidence on every single point.

01:48.000 --> 01:53.000
But whatever I've done to incur your wrath, Anthony, in the immortal words of Jack Nicholson,

01:53.000 --> 01:58.000
Why can't we all just get along?

02:18.000 --> 02:41.000
What's this?

02:41.000 --> 02:44.000
No, that wasn't what I meant.

02:44.000 --> 02:48.000
OK, let's instead take the same immortal words from Rodney King.

02:48.000 --> 02:57.000
I just want to say, you know, can we all get along? Can we get along?

02:57.000 --> 03:05.000
Can we stop making it horrible for the older people and the kids?

03:05.000 --> 03:10.000
Yes, Anthony, for the sake of the kids and the old people, let's just get along.

03:11.000 --> 03:19.000
If you hate the fact that I pointed out Monkton's many, many, many, many mistakes, from now on I'll believe everything he says unconditionally.

03:19.000 --> 03:22.000
I won't check anything ever again.

03:22.000 --> 03:25.000
Well, maybe I can put this better in a song.

03:25.000 --> 03:28.000
Man, I sleep this night the long way crying.

03:28.000 --> 03:30.000
Yeah, I've been crying, man.

03:30.000 --> 03:35.000
I've been telling her I believed you, but I knew you were lying.

03:35.000 --> 03:39.000
And right now you want to leave me alone.

03:39.000 --> 03:42.000
Just tell me one thing, Anthony.

03:42.000 --> 03:43.000
What did I do wrong?

03:43.000 --> 03:44.000
Why do you hurt me so bad?

03:44.000 --> 03:48.000
What did I do wrong?

03:48.000 --> 03:52.000
Nah, Anthony, I'm just kidding. Don't go starting another rumour.

03:52.000 --> 03:56.000
Look, as I've said before, you can run your site any way you like.

03:56.000 --> 03:59.000
You can make stuff up and block people and censor messages.

03:59.000 --> 04:01.000
It's your site.

04:01.000 --> 04:06.000
But when it comes to making stuff up about me, I'm politely asking you to correct it.

04:06.000 --> 04:10.000
And here's a fact you can check with Monkton yourself if you don't believe me.

04:10.000 --> 04:15.000
I'll say it again, I've never received an invitation to debate him face to face in a neutral venue,

04:15.000 --> 04:19.000
or anywhere for that matter, and I've never declined one.

04:19.000 --> 04:22.000
If Mr Monkton wants to debate my allegations face to face,

04:22.000 --> 04:25.000
I'll be happy to show him the documentary evidence,

04:25.000 --> 04:28.000
and he can give his answers to each of the claims made.

04:28.000 --> 04:31.000
Of course, this is unlikely to make much difference.

04:31.000 --> 04:35.000
I doubt what's up with that will come clean and tell its readers what I've just said.

04:35.000 --> 04:39.000
It'll either persist with this piece of fiction, or simply invent a new one.

04:39.000 --> 04:43.000
After all, Monkton hasn't agreed to debate me face to face.

04:43.000 --> 04:46.000
In fact, he opted out of a debate on what's up with that itself.

04:46.000 --> 04:50.000
And yet I don't see any diktat that references to him should be banned,

04:50.000 --> 04:56.000
and neither do I see any criticism of him on what's up with that for his unwillingness to debate.
