0	6000	I was asked recently why I wasn't going to take up Christopher Monkton's invitation to a public debate.
6000	8000	Well, there's a very good reason.
8000	11000	Monkton hasn't invited me to one.
11000	17000	It turns out that this can be traced back to yet another piece of fiction published on the What's Up With That website.
17000	24000	Further references to Peter Hadfield, who will not engage in a face-to-face debate in a neutral venue, will be deleted.
24000	32000	The claim that I refuse to debate Christopher Monkton comes on top of made-up quotes attributed to me by the guy who runs the channel, Anthony Watts.
32000	40000	So in order to correct this latest piece of misinformation, I sent the following message to the same comments forum where it appeared.
40000	50000	The message basically says what I've just told you, that I haven't received an invitation, I haven't declined one, and that I'd be delighted to show him all my documentary evidence face-to-face.
50000	53000	Not surprisingly, the message didn't appear.
53000	59000	A few days later, I tried again, this time addressing the moderator, DBS, and ending with,
59000	63000	Please publish this so that people are not misled by your erroneous claim.
63000	65000	It still didn't appear.
65000	70000	So I emailed Anthony Watts, asking him to correct the error. No response.
70000	75000	I have no idea why Anthony has taken such an intense dislike to me.
75000	78000	Yes, me. Can you imagine that?
78000	81000	Now he's even banned anyone from mentioning me.
81000	89000	Although that rule doesn't seem to apply if you want to add to the fictitious claim that I won't debate Monkton, or if you want to criticise me in general.
89000	93000	I don't know exactly what I've done to deserve all this acrimony.
93000	98000	Why are you doing this?
98000	108000	I've been polite in all my exchanges, and even my rebuttal to Monkton on what's up with that doggedly stuck to the facts and cited evidence on every single point.
108000	113000	But whatever I've done to incur your wrath, Anthony, in the immortal words of Jack Nicholson,
113000	118000	Why can't we all just get along?
138000	161000	What's this?
161000	164000	No, that wasn't what I meant.
164000	168000	OK, let's instead take the same immortal words from Rodney King.
168000	177000	I just want to say, you know, can we all get along? Can we get along?
177000	185000	Can we stop making it horrible for the older people and the kids?
185000	190000	Yes, Anthony, for the sake of the kids and the old people, let's just get along.
191000	199000	If you hate the fact that I pointed out Monkton's many, many, many, many mistakes, from now on I'll believe everything he says unconditionally.
199000	202000	I won't check anything ever again.
202000	205000	Well, maybe I can put this better in a song.
205000	208000	Man, I sleep this night the long way crying.
208000	210000	Yeah, I've been crying, man.
210000	215000	I've been telling her I believed you, but I knew you were lying.
215000	219000	And right now you want to leave me alone.
219000	222000	Just tell me one thing, Anthony.
222000	223000	What did I do wrong?
223000	224000	Why do you hurt me so bad?
224000	228000	What did I do wrong?
228000	232000	Nah, Anthony, I'm just kidding. Don't go starting another rumour.
232000	236000	Look, as I've said before, you can run your site any way you like.
236000	239000	You can make stuff up and block people and censor messages.
239000	241000	It's your site.
241000	246000	But when it comes to making stuff up about me, I'm politely asking you to correct it.
246000	250000	And here's a fact you can check with Monkton yourself if you don't believe me.
250000	255000	I'll say it again, I've never received an invitation to debate him face to face in a neutral venue,
255000	259000	or anywhere for that matter, and I've never declined one.
259000	262000	If Mr Monkton wants to debate my allegations face to face,
262000	265000	I'll be happy to show him the documentary evidence,
265000	268000	and he can give his answers to each of the claims made.
268000	271000	Of course, this is unlikely to make much difference.
271000	275000	I doubt what's up with that will come clean and tell its readers what I've just said.
275000	279000	It'll either persist with this piece of fiction, or simply invent a new one.
279000	283000	After all, Monkton hasn't agreed to debate me face to face.
283000	286000	In fact, he opted out of a debate on what's up with that itself.
286000	290000	And yet I don't see any diktat that references to him should be banned,
290000	296000	and neither do I see any criticism of him on what's up with that for his unwillingness to debate.
