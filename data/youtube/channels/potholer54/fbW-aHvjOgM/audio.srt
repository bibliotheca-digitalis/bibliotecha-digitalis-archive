1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,240
I've got a question for all those who are so unskeptical they believe whatever Christopher

2
00:00:04,240 --> 00:00:10,780
Monckton says about climate. Why? What is it about him that makes him so believable?

3
00:00:10,780 --> 00:00:13,860
Is it his science background as science advisor to Margaret Thatcher?

4
00:00:13,860 --> 00:00:18,180
Or Lord Christopher Monckton, former science advisor to Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher?

5
00:00:18,180 --> 00:00:22,400
Is it the fact that he wrote several peer-reviewed scientific papers, so he must know what he's

6
00:00:22,400 --> 00:00:23,000
talking about?

7
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:25,760
Now, when I write a peer-reviewed paper in a scientific journal...

8
00:00:25,760 --> 00:00:30,140
Or is it simply the weight of his irrefutable arguments, which you've checked for yourselves,

9
00:00:30,140 --> 00:00:33,480
and show quite clearly that his fellow scientists have got things wrong?

10
00:00:33,480 --> 00:00:38,320
Well, we can dispense with the first two very quickly. The idea that Monckton has some kind

11
00:00:38,320 --> 00:00:43,920
of a science background may have started with an article he wrote in 2006, claiming to have

12
00:00:43,920 --> 00:00:50,420
advised Margaret Thatcher on scientific scams and scares. In fact, he has no science background.

13
00:00:50,420 --> 00:00:54,280
He has a degree in classics and a diploma in journalism.

14
00:00:54,280 --> 00:00:58,380
And if he was Margaret Thatcher's science advisor, let's check her autobiography to

15
00:00:58,380 --> 00:01:00,520
see what she thought of his advice.

16
00:01:00,520 --> 00:01:05,780
That's funny. Margaret Thatcher says her science advisor in the policy unit was George

17
00:01:05,780 --> 00:01:11,200
Guy's. Well, maybe Monckton was the man who advised her specifically on climate change.

18
00:01:11,200 --> 00:01:12,800
After all, he says so himself.

19
00:01:12,800 --> 00:01:16,800
Now, Margaret Thatcher, whom I used to advise on this question 25 years ago...

20
00:01:16,800 --> 00:01:22,440
Nope, Margaret Thatcher disagrees. She specifically says George Guy's advised her on climate change,

21
00:01:22,600 --> 00:01:26,980
as a result of which she made a speech about it to the Royal Society, and set up the Climatic

22
00:01:26,980 --> 00:01:28,460
Research Unit.

23
00:01:28,460 --> 00:01:34,460
So what role did Monckton play in her life? Well, let's take a look in the index. Molotov?

24
00:01:34,460 --> 00:01:36,820
Molyneux? Monetarism?

25
00:01:36,820 --> 00:01:41,580
In the entire 900-page autobiography, it seems Margaret Thatcher couldn't find room for a

26
00:01:41,580 --> 00:01:45,780
single mention of one of her most important advisors.

27
00:01:45,780 --> 00:01:50,220
To be fair to Monckton, he started out in his climate campaign freely admitting he has

28
00:01:50,220 --> 00:01:51,940
no qualifications as a scientist.

29
00:01:51,940 --> 00:01:58,200
So you may be thinking, what right does a non-scientist, albeit a former political advisor

30
00:01:58,200 --> 00:02:03,580
to prime ministers, have to talk to us about the science of climate change?

31
00:02:03,580 --> 00:02:08,740
What about that peer-reviewed scientific paper? No, Monckton never wrote one. He was invited

32
00:02:08,740 --> 00:02:13,380
to submit an opinion piece to the newsletter of the American Physical Society as part of

33
00:02:13,380 --> 00:02:19,300
a debate. This isn't one of the APS's peer-reviewed journals, it's a forum for opinions, as the

34
00:02:19,300 --> 00:02:24,780
editorial statement of purpose shows. Monckton's insistence that his piece was peer-reviewed

35
00:02:24,780 --> 00:02:30,500
even led the editor to publish a response, pointing out that it wasn't.

36
00:02:30,500 --> 00:02:34,500
By now I'm sure a lot of Monckton fans will be saying, what does it matter if he isn't

37
00:02:34,500 --> 00:02:38,780
a scientist? He was never Margaret Thatcher's science advisor and has never published a

38
00:02:38,780 --> 00:02:43,580
scientific paper. If he's not presenting his own theories, but just correctly presenting

39
00:02:43,580 --> 00:02:49,100
data and inferences from the scientific literature, he doesn't need a science background.

40
00:02:49,100 --> 00:02:55,900
And I agree. But all this is conditional on these facts and these quotes being correct.

41
00:02:55,900 --> 00:03:00,500
If anyone thinks we should unquestioningly believe whatever Monckton says, and that checking

42
00:03:00,500 --> 00:03:04,900
his facts is somehow unfair, I'm going to call on someone who's going to support me

43
00:03:04,900 --> 00:03:06,600
throughout these videos.

44
00:03:06,600 --> 00:03:12,300
Skepticism is the highest of duties, blind faith, the one unpardonable sin.

45
00:03:12,300 --> 00:03:14,500
Yes, Christopher Monckton himself.

46
00:03:14,500 --> 00:03:20,700
Now I'm not going to give you, as he did in that film, my opinion about climate change,

47
00:03:20,700 --> 00:03:24,100
because it is as worthless as his.

48
00:03:24,100 --> 00:03:31,100
Everything I say, I can and will on request verify, either in the data or with equations

49
00:03:31,100 --> 00:03:33,380
or in the peer-reviewed literature.

50
00:03:33,380 --> 00:03:37,900
Then that makes things very easy. Where Mr Monckton gives sources, we can check them

51
00:03:37,900 --> 00:03:41,940
to make sure he's quoting them correctly. Where he doesn't give sources, we'll find

52
00:03:41,940 --> 00:03:43,700
out if he has any.

53
00:03:43,700 --> 00:03:48,000
Because as we'll see later in this video, I wrote to Mr Monckton asking him to verify

54
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:53,660
certain facts and asking for his sources, but the results were quite extraordinary,

55
00:03:53,660 --> 00:03:57,900
because I discovered that the person who can best debunk Christopher Monckton is Christopher

56
00:03:57,900 --> 00:04:00,020
Monckton himself.

57
00:04:00,020 --> 00:04:01,220
So where do we start?

58
00:04:01,220 --> 00:04:04,820
So here's the first one.

59
00:04:04,820 --> 00:04:11,760
We've had nine years of a global cooling trend since the first of January 2001.

60
00:04:11,760 --> 00:04:16,200
There has been global cooling for the last eight or nine years.

61
00:04:16,200 --> 00:04:20,280
Well, if Monckton is quoting from the data and the scientific literature, what does the

62
00:04:20,280 --> 00:04:23,240
data and the scientific literature say about this?

63
00:04:23,240 --> 00:04:28,080
A paper published in 2008 by the National Climate Centre in Australia looked at temperature

64
00:04:28,080 --> 00:04:33,000
data from the world's three terrestrial temperature monitoring bodies and concluded,

65
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:40,040
In all three data sets, the linear trend over 1998-2007 is upward, i.e. one of warming,

66
00:04:40,040 --> 00:04:44,640
even if the warming is weaker in the British data set than in the American data sets.

67
00:04:44,640 --> 00:04:49,640
1998 was even warmer than Monckton's starting point, 2001.

68
00:04:49,640 --> 00:04:54,560
In addition, an independent group of statisticians was given the raw data by the Associated Press

69
00:04:54,560 --> 00:04:57,000
without being told what it was.

70
00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:02,660
The experts found no true temperature declines over time.

71
00:05:02,660 --> 00:05:07,160
And the AP quoted NOAA climate monitoring chief, Deke Arndt, as saying,

72
00:05:07,160 --> 00:05:10,840
The last ten years are the warmest ten-year period of the modern record.

73
00:05:10,840 --> 00:05:15,200
Even if you analyse the trend during that ten years, the trend is actually positive,

74
00:05:15,200 --> 00:05:17,560
which means warming.

75
00:05:17,560 --> 00:05:22,320
So if temperature monitoring bodies and reviewers and statisticians say the trend is up, what

76
00:05:22,320 --> 00:05:25,780
experts is Monckton citing to show the trend is down?

77
00:05:25,780 --> 00:05:32,020
And what that looks to me like is a fairly hefty, and indeed it is, statistically significant

78
00:05:32,020 --> 00:05:33,160
rate of fall.

79
00:05:33,160 --> 00:05:35,320
It turns out none.

80
00:05:35,320 --> 00:05:39,940
Monckton is giving us his own opinion, and since he has no expertise in this field, he's

81
00:05:39,940 --> 00:05:44,140
quite right to say that his opinion is as worthless as Al Gore's.

82
00:05:44,140 --> 00:05:48,720
For a start, you can't tell statistical significance just by looking at a graph.

83
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:53,640
As I explained in an earlier video, statistically significant doesn't mean notable.

84
00:05:53,640 --> 00:05:57,840
It has a specific mathematical meaning and has to be calculated.

85
00:05:57,840 --> 00:06:02,020
But statistically significant or not, how did Monckton end up drawing a downward trend

86
00:06:02,020 --> 00:06:05,940
line when all the experts insist that the trend is up?

87
00:06:05,940 --> 00:06:08,380
It turns out the answer is very simple.

88
00:06:08,380 --> 00:06:12,140
It all depends on where you choose your start and end points.

89
00:06:12,140 --> 00:06:16,360
Global temperatures are subject to short-term cyclical factors, from the El Niño-southern

90
00:06:16,360 --> 00:06:20,760
Oscillation every few years to the solar cycle every eleven years.

91
00:06:20,760 --> 00:06:25,180
So if you choose a start and end point over a very short period of time, with strong warming

92
00:06:25,180 --> 00:06:30,580
factors such as El Niño near the start, and an exceptional solar minimum towards the end,

93
00:06:30,580 --> 00:06:34,580
these natural background fluctuations will skew the result.

94
00:06:34,580 --> 00:06:39,660
John Grego, a professor of statistics at the University of South Carolina, told the AP,

95
00:06:39,660 --> 00:06:44,740
if you look at the data and sort of cherry-pick a micro-trend within a bigger trend, that

96
00:06:44,740 --> 00:06:47,860
technique is particularly suspect.

97
00:06:47,860 --> 00:06:52,060
If Monckton fans find that hard to believe, I have someone here who'll tell you exactly

98
00:06:52,060 --> 00:06:53,260
the same thing.

99
00:06:53,260 --> 00:06:57,620
If you choose your start points and your end points carefully enough, you can make it look

100
00:06:57,620 --> 00:06:59,820
as though any trend you want is happening.

101
00:06:59,820 --> 00:07:06,900
We've had nine years of a global cooling trend since the first of January 2001.

102
00:07:06,900 --> 00:07:11,120
So how do climate scientists and statisticians get around this problem?

103
00:07:11,120 --> 00:07:14,020
As I explained in climate change, is the Earth cooling?

104
00:07:14,020 --> 00:07:18,820
For one thing, they look at time periods over decades, rather than just a few years.

105
00:07:18,820 --> 00:07:23,180
When you expand the timeline and look at the last few years in context, things look a little

106
00:07:23,180 --> 00:07:24,340
different.

107
00:07:24,340 --> 00:07:29,140
They can also correct this data for anomalies like the El Niño-southern Oscillation.

108
00:07:29,140 --> 00:07:34,340
And most commonly, they even out the background fluctuations by taking a moving average every

109
00:07:34,340 --> 00:07:36,180
5, 10 or 11 years.

110
00:07:36,180 --> 00:07:39,460
That way, the underlying trend becomes clear.

111
00:07:39,460 --> 00:07:43,580
Temperatures started moving upwards in the mid to late 1970s, and they're still moving

112
00:07:43,580 --> 00:07:49,380
up today.

113
00:07:49,380 --> 00:07:54,340
Then we go on to Arctic sea ice, which follows a regular kind of sine wave.

114
00:07:54,340 --> 00:07:56,420
It comes and goes with the seasons.

115
00:07:56,420 --> 00:08:00,480
There's lots of it during the winter, not so much during the summer.

116
00:08:00,480 --> 00:08:03,900
Nothing particularly to worry about in that graph there.

117
00:08:03,900 --> 00:08:09,940
In fact, there was a temporary loss of Arctic sea ice at the summer minimum in 2007.

118
00:08:09,940 --> 00:08:12,260
That's the left-hand globe there.

119
00:08:12,260 --> 00:08:16,060
But then by 2008, it's the purple area, which is the sea ice.

120
00:08:16,060 --> 00:08:19,840
That's just the way the computer graphics from the satellite do it.

121
00:08:19,840 --> 00:08:22,500
By 2008, half of that missing ice had come back.

122
00:08:22,500 --> 00:08:26,500
By 2009, nearly all of it had come back.

123
00:08:26,500 --> 00:08:32,700
So we're not looking at a sort of long-term, systematic loss of ice in the Arctic.

124
00:08:32,700 --> 00:08:36,520
Now this surprised me, because research papers show there's been a steady loss of Arctic

125
00:08:36,520 --> 00:08:38,220
sea ice for 30 years.

126
00:08:38,220 --> 00:08:42,900
Since Moncton says everything he tells us comes from the data and the scientific literature,

127
00:08:42,900 --> 00:08:45,620
then it should be easy to discover who's right.

128
00:08:45,620 --> 00:08:48,320
All I needed was Moncton's source.

129
00:08:48,320 --> 00:08:53,300
As so often happens, Moncton doesn't give a source, so I wrote to him asking for one,

130
00:08:53,300 --> 00:08:54,760
and he wrote back,

131
00:08:54,760 --> 00:08:58,920
For Arctic and Antarctic sea ice, see the monthly CO2 reports that I produce for the

132
00:08:58,920 --> 00:09:01,160
Science and Public Policy Institute.

133
00:09:01,160 --> 00:09:03,920
The graphs are all explained and sourced.

134
00:09:03,920 --> 00:09:09,160
There was only one graph that specifically related to Arctic ice going back just 10 years,

135
00:09:09,160 --> 00:09:13,620
and while the graph was sourced, the interpretation of it was not.

136
00:09:13,620 --> 00:09:18,040
So I asked Moncton again for the sources that back up his claim that we're not looking at

137
00:09:18,040 --> 00:09:21,680
a sort of long-term, systematic loss of ice in the Arctic.

138
00:09:21,680 --> 00:09:23,720
He came back with this.

139
00:09:23,720 --> 00:09:28,560
Arctic sea ice has indeed been declining in extent for 30 years, and the monthly CO2 reports

140
00:09:28,560 --> 00:09:30,560
fairly reflect this.

141
00:09:30,560 --> 00:09:32,440
What was that first bit again?

142
00:09:32,440 --> 00:09:36,880
Arctic sea ice has indeed been declining in extent for 30 years, but didn't you just tell

143
00:09:36,880 --> 00:09:37,880
everyone

144
00:09:37,880 --> 00:09:43,640
We're not looking at a sort of long-term, systematic loss of ice in the Arctic.

145
00:09:43,640 --> 00:09:46,640
Once again, which Moncton should we believe?

146
00:09:46,640 --> 00:09:51,840
Speaking in the monthly CO2 report, Moncton does indeed accept that there has been a decline.

147
00:09:51,840 --> 00:09:56,620
There has been a very slight decline in the trend of global sea ice extent over the decades,

148
00:09:56,620 --> 00:10:01,040
chiefly attributable to a loss of sea ice in the Arctic during the summer.

149
00:10:01,040 --> 00:10:06,400
So his preaching of no long-term decline is not only unsupported by the data and the scientific

150
00:10:06,400 --> 00:10:10,020
literature, even Moncton accepts that it's wrong.

151
00:10:10,020 --> 00:10:14,540
And yet the arguments he gives to his audiences seem absolutely convincing.

152
00:10:14,540 --> 00:10:17,160
So let's see how Moncton managed to persuade them.

153
00:10:17,160 --> 00:10:21,500
If you choose your start points and your end points carefully enough, you can make it look

154
00:10:21,500 --> 00:10:23,920
as though any trend you want is happening.

155
00:10:23,920 --> 00:10:28,620
In this case, Moncton's start point and end point were embarrassingly close together.

156
00:10:28,620 --> 00:10:35,240
His start point was just two years earlier, in 2007, when ice extent was at a record low.

157
00:10:35,240 --> 00:10:40,220
This wasn't primarily caused by global warming, it was the result of winds and currents.

158
00:10:40,220 --> 00:10:42,260
And Moncton acknowledges this.

159
00:10:42,280 --> 00:10:47,080
But there are 30 years of data going back to when satellite images were first taken.

160
00:10:47,080 --> 00:10:48,940
This is what it shows.

161
00:10:48,940 --> 00:10:54,040
As Moncton admits, when you press for a source, it's a 30-year decline.

162
00:10:54,040 --> 00:10:58,420
And if we go back even further, we can see the last 30 years in context.

163
00:10:58,420 --> 00:11:02,880
So Moncton seems to be giving one message to his audiences and in videos, but a very

164
00:11:02,880 --> 00:11:07,400
different message if anyone takes the trouble to check his facts in more detail.

165
00:11:07,400 --> 00:11:11,440
As I've said before, when someone makes a surprising claim, the best way to disprove

166
00:11:11,440 --> 00:11:15,360
it is to force them to give up their source, however reluctantly.

167
00:11:15,360 --> 00:11:21,120
90% of the time, finding the source or the non-existence of a source gets you to the truth.

168
00:11:24,120 --> 00:11:27,120
How many of you have heard that Greenland is melting away?

169
00:11:27,120 --> 00:11:28,960
Yes, that's right, you've all heard that.

170
00:11:28,960 --> 00:11:29,960
Right.

171
00:11:29,960 --> 00:11:35,800
Here is a paper by Johannessen et al., a very diligent Danish researcher using laser altimetry.

172
00:11:36,160 --> 00:11:44,480
And what he found was that between 1992 and 2003, the average thickness of the vast Greenland

173
00:11:44,480 --> 00:11:48,560
ice sheet increased by two inches a year.

174
00:11:48,560 --> 00:11:50,680
Up to a point, Lord Copper.

175
00:11:50,680 --> 00:11:55,360
Once again, resolving the differences between Moncton and the climatologists is fairly easy

176
00:11:55,360 --> 00:11:58,440
because both claim to cite the scientific literature.

177
00:11:58,440 --> 00:12:04,560
And here, Moncton actually gives us a source, a paper by Johannessen published in 2005.

178
00:12:04,560 --> 00:12:08,520
If Johannessen's altimetry measurements show a thickening of the Greenland ice sheet, and

179
00:12:08,520 --> 00:12:12,940
this is not disputed by other researchers, then Moncton doesn't need to convince me with

180
00:12:12,940 --> 00:12:15,320
pictures of ice getting thicker.

181
00:12:15,320 --> 00:12:18,600
What I am going to do is check what Moncton claims.

182
00:12:18,600 --> 00:12:21,560
I'm going to read Johannessen's paper.

183
00:12:21,560 --> 00:12:25,440
And it turns out he did not report that the average thickness of the Greenland ice sheet

184
00:12:25,440 --> 00:12:26,580
has increased.

185
00:12:26,580 --> 00:12:30,880
On the contrary, he says we can't make that assessment because his study only measured

186
00:12:30,880 --> 00:12:35,440
the interior of Greenland at an altitude of 1500 metres or more.

187
00:12:35,440 --> 00:12:38,840
The title of the paper alone should have been a clue.

188
00:12:38,840 --> 00:12:43,840
It's conceivable, Johannessen says, that Greenland is losing more ice through ablation, that's

189
00:12:43,840 --> 00:12:49,880
melting, at the lower altitudes than it's gaining ice at the higher altitudes he measured.

190
00:12:49,880 --> 00:12:53,600
That's putting what he said into plain English, but if Moncton fans find it hard to believe

191
00:12:53,600 --> 00:12:59,320
Moncton got this wrong, please pause the video and read what Johannessen wrote for yourselves.

192
00:12:59,320 --> 00:13:03,120
Or look up the paper on the internet and read the whole thing.

193
00:13:03,120 --> 00:13:07,000
And since that paper was published, other studies have shown that the ice loss at lower

194
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:11,200
altitudes is greater than the ice gain that Johannessen measured.

195
00:13:11,200 --> 00:13:14,640
In other words, there's a net loss of ice from Greenland.

196
00:13:14,640 --> 00:13:18,160
Two definitive papers were published in 2006.

197
00:13:18,160 --> 00:13:22,320
So these were available to Moncton at the time he made his speeches, telling everyone

198
00:13:22,320 --> 00:13:24,960
that there was no net loss.

199
00:13:24,960 --> 00:13:29,300
Another thing that Moncton missed is Johannessen's conclusion that the increase in ice at higher

200
00:13:29,300 --> 00:13:35,160
altitudes could be due to a decadal climate system like the North Atlantic Oscillation.

201
00:13:35,160 --> 00:13:39,460
What's more, he says this increase was predicted by climate models.

202
00:13:39,460 --> 00:13:45,060
I am simply going to tell you a series of facts from the science and the data and the

203
00:13:45,060 --> 00:13:51,540
peer-reviewed literature, and I am going to allow you to draw the conclusion for yourselves.

204
00:13:51,540 --> 00:13:56,060
I'm not going to presume that Moncton is deliberately trying to mislead his audiences.

205
00:13:56,060 --> 00:13:58,380
As always, I can't discern motivation.

206
00:13:58,380 --> 00:14:02,340
I can only check the information and show whether it's right or wrong.

207
00:14:02,340 --> 00:14:08,220
But assuming Moncton is sincere in his beliefs, then there are only two possible conclusions.

208
00:14:08,220 --> 00:14:12,380
Either he didn't read or he misunderstood the scientific studies that have measured

209
00:14:12,380 --> 00:14:14,420
the loss of ice in Greenland.

210
00:14:14,420 --> 00:14:19,460
And either he didn't read or he misunderstood the one paper he quoted upon which his entire

211
00:14:19,460 --> 00:14:21,220
argument rests.

212
00:14:21,220 --> 00:14:24,180
I would urge Moncton fans to do what I did.

213
00:14:24,180 --> 00:14:26,460
If he doesn't give a source, be skeptical.

214
00:14:26,460 --> 00:14:28,300
If he does give a source, read it.

215
00:14:28,300 --> 00:14:31,100
And that's what the scientific method is about.

216
00:14:31,100 --> 00:14:32,900
It's about checking.

217
00:14:32,900 --> 00:14:36,900
Moncton gets so many things wrong, and it's so easy to show that he's wrong, that I've

218
00:14:36,900 --> 00:14:39,580
got at least two more videos to do on him.

219
00:14:39,580 --> 00:14:43,140
And in case they get removed from YouTube, please copy and mirror them.
