00:00.000 --> 00:04.240
I've got a question for all those who are so unskeptical they believe whatever Christopher

00:04.240 --> 00:10.780
Monckton says about climate. Why? What is it about him that makes him so believable?

00:10.780 --> 00:13.860
Is it his science background as science advisor to Margaret Thatcher?

00:13.860 --> 00:18.180
Or Lord Christopher Monckton, former science advisor to Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher?

00:18.180 --> 00:22.400
Is it the fact that he wrote several peer-reviewed scientific papers, so he must know what he's

00:22.400 --> 00:23.000
talking about?

00:23.000 --> 00:25.760
Now, when I write a peer-reviewed paper in a scientific journal...

00:25.760 --> 00:30.140
Or is it simply the weight of his irrefutable arguments, which you've checked for yourselves,

00:30.140 --> 00:33.480
and show quite clearly that his fellow scientists have got things wrong?

00:33.480 --> 00:38.320
Well, we can dispense with the first two very quickly. The idea that Monckton has some kind

00:38.320 --> 00:43.920
of a science background may have started with an article he wrote in 2006, claiming to have

00:43.920 --> 00:50.420
advised Margaret Thatcher on scientific scams and scares. In fact, he has no science background.

00:50.420 --> 00:54.280
He has a degree in classics and a diploma in journalism.

00:54.280 --> 00:58.380
And if he was Margaret Thatcher's science advisor, let's check her autobiography to

00:58.380 --> 01:00.520
see what she thought of his advice.

01:00.520 --> 01:05.780
That's funny. Margaret Thatcher says her science advisor in the policy unit was George

01:05.780 --> 01:11.200
Guy's. Well, maybe Monckton was the man who advised her specifically on climate change.

01:11.200 --> 01:12.800
After all, he says so himself.

01:12.800 --> 01:16.800
Now, Margaret Thatcher, whom I used to advise on this question 25 years ago...

01:16.800 --> 01:22.440
Nope, Margaret Thatcher disagrees. She specifically says George Guy's advised her on climate change,

01:22.600 --> 01:26.980
as a result of which she made a speech about it to the Royal Society, and set up the Climatic

01:26.980 --> 01:28.460
Research Unit.

01:28.460 --> 01:34.460
So what role did Monckton play in her life? Well, let's take a look in the index. Molotov?

01:34.460 --> 01:36.820
Molyneux? Monetarism?

01:36.820 --> 01:41.580
In the entire 900-page autobiography, it seems Margaret Thatcher couldn't find room for a

01:41.580 --> 01:45.780
single mention of one of her most important advisors.

01:45.780 --> 01:50.220
To be fair to Monckton, he started out in his climate campaign freely admitting he has

01:50.220 --> 01:51.940
no qualifications as a scientist.

01:51.940 --> 01:58.200
So you may be thinking, what right does a non-scientist, albeit a former political advisor

01:58.200 --> 02:03.580
to prime ministers, have to talk to us about the science of climate change?

02:03.580 --> 02:08.740
What about that peer-reviewed scientific paper? No, Monckton never wrote one. He was invited

02:08.740 --> 02:13.380
to submit an opinion piece to the newsletter of the American Physical Society as part of

02:13.380 --> 02:19.300
a debate. This isn't one of the APS's peer-reviewed journals, it's a forum for opinions, as the

02:19.300 --> 02:24.780
editorial statement of purpose shows. Monckton's insistence that his piece was peer-reviewed

02:24.780 --> 02:30.500
even led the editor to publish a response, pointing out that it wasn't.

02:30.500 --> 02:34.500
By now I'm sure a lot of Monckton fans will be saying, what does it matter if he isn't

02:34.500 --> 02:38.780
a scientist? He was never Margaret Thatcher's science advisor and has never published a

02:38.780 --> 02:43.580
scientific paper. If he's not presenting his own theories, but just correctly presenting

02:43.580 --> 02:49.100
data and inferences from the scientific literature, he doesn't need a science background.

02:49.100 --> 02:55.900
And I agree. But all this is conditional on these facts and these quotes being correct.

02:55.900 --> 03:00.500
If anyone thinks we should unquestioningly believe whatever Monckton says, and that checking

03:00.500 --> 03:04.900
his facts is somehow unfair, I'm going to call on someone who's going to support me

03:04.900 --> 03:06.600
throughout these videos.

03:06.600 --> 03:12.300
Skepticism is the highest of duties, blind faith, the one unpardonable sin.

03:12.300 --> 03:14.500
Yes, Christopher Monckton himself.

03:14.500 --> 03:20.700
Now I'm not going to give you, as he did in that film, my opinion about climate change,

03:20.700 --> 03:24.100
because it is as worthless as his.

03:24.100 --> 03:31.100
Everything I say, I can and will on request verify, either in the data or with equations

03:31.100 --> 03:33.380
or in the peer-reviewed literature.

03:33.380 --> 03:37.900
Then that makes things very easy. Where Mr Monckton gives sources, we can check them

03:37.900 --> 03:41.940
to make sure he's quoting them correctly. Where he doesn't give sources, we'll find

03:41.940 --> 03:43.700
out if he has any.

03:43.700 --> 03:48.000
Because as we'll see later in this video, I wrote to Mr Monckton asking him to verify

03:48.000 --> 03:53.660
certain facts and asking for his sources, but the results were quite extraordinary,

03:53.660 --> 03:57.900
because I discovered that the person who can best debunk Christopher Monckton is Christopher

03:57.900 --> 04:00.020
Monckton himself.

04:00.020 --> 04:01.220
So where do we start?

04:01.220 --> 04:04.820
So here's the first one.

04:04.820 --> 04:11.760
We've had nine years of a global cooling trend since the first of January 2001.

04:11.760 --> 04:16.200
There has been global cooling for the last eight or nine years.

04:16.200 --> 04:20.280
Well, if Monckton is quoting from the data and the scientific literature, what does the

04:20.280 --> 04:23.240
data and the scientific literature say about this?

04:23.240 --> 04:28.080
A paper published in 2008 by the National Climate Centre in Australia looked at temperature

04:28.080 --> 04:33.000
data from the world's three terrestrial temperature monitoring bodies and concluded,

04:33.000 --> 04:40.040
In all three data sets, the linear trend over 1998-2007 is upward, i.e. one of warming,

04:40.040 --> 04:44.640
even if the warming is weaker in the British data set than in the American data sets.

04:44.640 --> 04:49.640
1998 was even warmer than Monckton's starting point, 2001.

04:49.640 --> 04:54.560
In addition, an independent group of statisticians was given the raw data by the Associated Press

04:54.560 --> 04:57.000
without being told what it was.

04:57.000 --> 05:02.660
The experts found no true temperature declines over time.

05:02.660 --> 05:07.160
And the AP quoted NOAA climate monitoring chief, Deke Arndt, as saying,

05:07.160 --> 05:10.840
The last ten years are the warmest ten-year period of the modern record.

05:10.840 --> 05:15.200
Even if you analyse the trend during that ten years, the trend is actually positive,

05:15.200 --> 05:17.560
which means warming.

05:17.560 --> 05:22.320
So if temperature monitoring bodies and reviewers and statisticians say the trend is up, what

05:22.320 --> 05:25.780
experts is Monckton citing to show the trend is down?

05:25.780 --> 05:32.020
And what that looks to me like is a fairly hefty, and indeed it is, statistically significant

05:32.020 --> 05:33.160
rate of fall.

05:33.160 --> 05:35.320
It turns out none.

05:35.320 --> 05:39.940
Monckton is giving us his own opinion, and since he has no expertise in this field, he's

05:39.940 --> 05:44.140
quite right to say that his opinion is as worthless as Al Gore's.

05:44.140 --> 05:48.720
For a start, you can't tell statistical significance just by looking at a graph.

05:48.720 --> 05:53.640
As I explained in an earlier video, statistically significant doesn't mean notable.

05:53.640 --> 05:57.840
It has a specific mathematical meaning and has to be calculated.

05:57.840 --> 06:02.020
But statistically significant or not, how did Monckton end up drawing a downward trend

06:02.020 --> 06:05.940
line when all the experts insist that the trend is up?

06:05.940 --> 06:08.380
It turns out the answer is very simple.

06:08.380 --> 06:12.140
It all depends on where you choose your start and end points.

06:12.140 --> 06:16.360
Global temperatures are subject to short-term cyclical factors, from the El Niño-southern

06:16.360 --> 06:20.760
Oscillation every few years to the solar cycle every eleven years.

06:20.760 --> 06:25.180
So if you choose a start and end point over a very short period of time, with strong warming

06:25.180 --> 06:30.580
factors such as El Niño near the start, and an exceptional solar minimum towards the end,

06:30.580 --> 06:34.580
these natural background fluctuations will skew the result.

06:34.580 --> 06:39.660
John Grego, a professor of statistics at the University of South Carolina, told the AP,

06:39.660 --> 06:44.740
if you look at the data and sort of cherry-pick a micro-trend within a bigger trend, that

06:44.740 --> 06:47.860
technique is particularly suspect.

06:47.860 --> 06:52.060
If Monckton fans find that hard to believe, I have someone here who'll tell you exactly

06:52.060 --> 06:53.260
the same thing.

06:53.260 --> 06:57.620
If you choose your start points and your end points carefully enough, you can make it look

06:57.620 --> 06:59.820
as though any trend you want is happening.

06:59.820 --> 07:06.900
We've had nine years of a global cooling trend since the first of January 2001.

07:06.900 --> 07:11.120
So how do climate scientists and statisticians get around this problem?

07:11.120 --> 07:14.020
As I explained in climate change, is the Earth cooling?

07:14.020 --> 07:18.820
For one thing, they look at time periods over decades, rather than just a few years.

07:18.820 --> 07:23.180
When you expand the timeline and look at the last few years in context, things look a little

07:23.180 --> 07:24.340
different.

07:24.340 --> 07:29.140
They can also correct this data for anomalies like the El Niño-southern Oscillation.

07:29.140 --> 07:34.340
And most commonly, they even out the background fluctuations by taking a moving average every

07:34.340 --> 07:36.180
5, 10 or 11 years.

07:36.180 --> 07:39.460
That way, the underlying trend becomes clear.

07:39.460 --> 07:43.580
Temperatures started moving upwards in the mid to late 1970s, and they're still moving

07:43.580 --> 07:49.380
up today.

07:49.380 --> 07:54.340
Then we go on to Arctic sea ice, which follows a regular kind of sine wave.

07:54.340 --> 07:56.420
It comes and goes with the seasons.

07:56.420 --> 08:00.480
There's lots of it during the winter, not so much during the summer.

08:00.480 --> 08:03.900
Nothing particularly to worry about in that graph there.

08:03.900 --> 08:09.940
In fact, there was a temporary loss of Arctic sea ice at the summer minimum in 2007.

08:09.940 --> 08:12.260
That's the left-hand globe there.

08:12.260 --> 08:16.060
But then by 2008, it's the purple area, which is the sea ice.

08:16.060 --> 08:19.840
That's just the way the computer graphics from the satellite do it.

08:19.840 --> 08:22.500
By 2008, half of that missing ice had come back.

08:22.500 --> 08:26.500
By 2009, nearly all of it had come back.

08:26.500 --> 08:32.700
So we're not looking at a sort of long-term, systematic loss of ice in the Arctic.

08:32.700 --> 08:36.520
Now this surprised me, because research papers show there's been a steady loss of Arctic

08:36.520 --> 08:38.220
sea ice for 30 years.

08:38.220 --> 08:42.900
Since Moncton says everything he tells us comes from the data and the scientific literature,

08:42.900 --> 08:45.620
then it should be easy to discover who's right.

08:45.620 --> 08:48.320
All I needed was Moncton's source.

08:48.320 --> 08:53.300
As so often happens, Moncton doesn't give a source, so I wrote to him asking for one,

08:53.300 --> 08:54.760
and he wrote back,

08:54.760 --> 08:58.920
For Arctic and Antarctic sea ice, see the monthly CO2 reports that I produce for the

08:58.920 --> 09:01.160
Science and Public Policy Institute.

09:01.160 --> 09:03.920
The graphs are all explained and sourced.

09:03.920 --> 09:09.160
There was only one graph that specifically related to Arctic ice going back just 10 years,

09:09.160 --> 09:13.620
and while the graph was sourced, the interpretation of it was not.

09:13.620 --> 09:18.040
So I asked Moncton again for the sources that back up his claim that we're not looking at

09:18.040 --> 09:21.680
a sort of long-term, systematic loss of ice in the Arctic.

09:21.680 --> 09:23.720
He came back with this.

09:23.720 --> 09:28.560
Arctic sea ice has indeed been declining in extent for 30 years, and the monthly CO2 reports

09:28.560 --> 09:30.560
fairly reflect this.

09:30.560 --> 09:32.440
What was that first bit again?

09:32.440 --> 09:36.880
Arctic sea ice has indeed been declining in extent for 30 years, but didn't you just tell

09:36.880 --> 09:37.880
everyone

09:37.880 --> 09:43.640
We're not looking at a sort of long-term, systematic loss of ice in the Arctic.

09:43.640 --> 09:46.640
Once again, which Moncton should we believe?

09:46.640 --> 09:51.840
Speaking in the monthly CO2 report, Moncton does indeed accept that there has been a decline.

09:51.840 --> 09:56.620
There has been a very slight decline in the trend of global sea ice extent over the decades,

09:56.620 --> 10:01.040
chiefly attributable to a loss of sea ice in the Arctic during the summer.

10:01.040 --> 10:06.400
So his preaching of no long-term decline is not only unsupported by the data and the scientific

10:06.400 --> 10:10.020
literature, even Moncton accepts that it's wrong.

10:10.020 --> 10:14.540
And yet the arguments he gives to his audiences seem absolutely convincing.

10:14.540 --> 10:17.160
So let's see how Moncton managed to persuade them.

10:17.160 --> 10:21.500
If you choose your start points and your end points carefully enough, you can make it look

10:21.500 --> 10:23.920
as though any trend you want is happening.

10:23.920 --> 10:28.620
In this case, Moncton's start point and end point were embarrassingly close together.

10:28.620 --> 10:35.240
His start point was just two years earlier, in 2007, when ice extent was at a record low.

10:35.240 --> 10:40.220
This wasn't primarily caused by global warming, it was the result of winds and currents.

10:40.220 --> 10:42.260
And Moncton acknowledges this.

10:42.280 --> 10:47.080
But there are 30 years of data going back to when satellite images were first taken.

10:47.080 --> 10:48.940
This is what it shows.

10:48.940 --> 10:54.040
As Moncton admits, when you press for a source, it's a 30-year decline.

10:54.040 --> 10:58.420
And if we go back even further, we can see the last 30 years in context.

10:58.420 --> 11:02.880
So Moncton seems to be giving one message to his audiences and in videos, but a very

11:02.880 --> 11:07.400
different message if anyone takes the trouble to check his facts in more detail.

11:07.400 --> 11:11.440
As I've said before, when someone makes a surprising claim, the best way to disprove

11:11.440 --> 11:15.360
it is to force them to give up their source, however reluctantly.

11:15.360 --> 11:21.120
90% of the time, finding the source or the non-existence of a source gets you to the truth.

11:24.120 --> 11:27.120
How many of you have heard that Greenland is melting away?

11:27.120 --> 11:28.960
Yes, that's right, you've all heard that.

11:28.960 --> 11:29.960
Right.

11:29.960 --> 11:35.800
Here is a paper by Johannessen et al., a very diligent Danish researcher using laser altimetry.

11:36.160 --> 11:44.480
And what he found was that between 1992 and 2003, the average thickness of the vast Greenland

11:44.480 --> 11:48.560
ice sheet increased by two inches a year.

11:48.560 --> 11:50.680
Up to a point, Lord Copper.

11:50.680 --> 11:55.360
Once again, resolving the differences between Moncton and the climatologists is fairly easy

11:55.360 --> 11:58.440
because both claim to cite the scientific literature.

11:58.440 --> 12:04.560
And here, Moncton actually gives us a source, a paper by Johannessen published in 2005.

12:04.560 --> 12:08.520
If Johannessen's altimetry measurements show a thickening of the Greenland ice sheet, and

12:08.520 --> 12:12.940
this is not disputed by other researchers, then Moncton doesn't need to convince me with

12:12.940 --> 12:15.320
pictures of ice getting thicker.

12:15.320 --> 12:18.600
What I am going to do is check what Moncton claims.

12:18.600 --> 12:21.560
I'm going to read Johannessen's paper.

12:21.560 --> 12:25.440
And it turns out he did not report that the average thickness of the Greenland ice sheet

12:25.440 --> 12:26.580
has increased.

12:26.580 --> 12:30.880
On the contrary, he says we can't make that assessment because his study only measured

12:30.880 --> 12:35.440
the interior of Greenland at an altitude of 1500 metres or more.

12:35.440 --> 12:38.840
The title of the paper alone should have been a clue.

12:38.840 --> 12:43.840
It's conceivable, Johannessen says, that Greenland is losing more ice through ablation, that's

12:43.840 --> 12:49.880
melting, at the lower altitudes than it's gaining ice at the higher altitudes he measured.

12:49.880 --> 12:53.600
That's putting what he said into plain English, but if Moncton fans find it hard to believe

12:53.600 --> 12:59.320
Moncton got this wrong, please pause the video and read what Johannessen wrote for yourselves.

12:59.320 --> 13:03.120
Or look up the paper on the internet and read the whole thing.

13:03.120 --> 13:07.000
And since that paper was published, other studies have shown that the ice loss at lower

13:07.000 --> 13:11.200
altitudes is greater than the ice gain that Johannessen measured.

13:11.200 --> 13:14.640
In other words, there's a net loss of ice from Greenland.

13:14.640 --> 13:18.160
Two definitive papers were published in 2006.

13:18.160 --> 13:22.320
So these were available to Moncton at the time he made his speeches, telling everyone

13:22.320 --> 13:24.960
that there was no net loss.

13:24.960 --> 13:29.300
Another thing that Moncton missed is Johannessen's conclusion that the increase in ice at higher

13:29.300 --> 13:35.160
altitudes could be due to a decadal climate system like the North Atlantic Oscillation.

13:35.160 --> 13:39.460
What's more, he says this increase was predicted by climate models.

13:39.460 --> 13:45.060
I am simply going to tell you a series of facts from the science and the data and the

13:45.060 --> 13:51.540
peer-reviewed literature, and I am going to allow you to draw the conclusion for yourselves.

13:51.540 --> 13:56.060
I'm not going to presume that Moncton is deliberately trying to mislead his audiences.

13:56.060 --> 13:58.380
As always, I can't discern motivation.

13:58.380 --> 14:02.340
I can only check the information and show whether it's right or wrong.

14:02.340 --> 14:08.220
But assuming Moncton is sincere in his beliefs, then there are only two possible conclusions.

14:08.220 --> 14:12.380
Either he didn't read or he misunderstood the scientific studies that have measured

14:12.380 --> 14:14.420
the loss of ice in Greenland.

14:14.420 --> 14:19.460
And either he didn't read or he misunderstood the one paper he quoted upon which his entire

14:19.460 --> 14:21.220
argument rests.

14:21.220 --> 14:24.180
I would urge Moncton fans to do what I did.

14:24.180 --> 14:26.460
If he doesn't give a source, be skeptical.

14:26.460 --> 14:28.300
If he does give a source, read it.

14:28.300 --> 14:31.100
And that's what the scientific method is about.

14:31.100 --> 14:32.900
It's about checking.

14:32.900 --> 14:36.900
Moncton gets so many things wrong, and it's so easy to show that he's wrong, that I've

14:36.900 --> 14:39.580
got at least two more videos to do on him.

14:39.580 --> 14:43.140
