0	4240	I've got a question for all those who are so unskeptical they believe whatever Christopher
4240	10780	Monckton says about climate. Why? What is it about him that makes him so believable?
10780	13860	Is it his science background as science advisor to Margaret Thatcher?
13860	18180	Or Lord Christopher Monckton, former science advisor to Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher?
18180	22400	Is it the fact that he wrote several peer-reviewed scientific papers, so he must know what he's
22400	23000	talking about?
23000	25760	Now, when I write a peer-reviewed paper in a scientific journal...
25760	30140	Or is it simply the weight of his irrefutable arguments, which you've checked for yourselves,
30140	33480	and show quite clearly that his fellow scientists have got things wrong?
33480	38320	Well, we can dispense with the first two very quickly. The idea that Monckton has some kind
38320	43920	of a science background may have started with an article he wrote in 2006, claiming to have
43920	50420	advised Margaret Thatcher on scientific scams and scares. In fact, he has no science background.
50420	54280	He has a degree in classics and a diploma in journalism.
54280	58380	And if he was Margaret Thatcher's science advisor, let's check her autobiography to
58380	60520	see what she thought of his advice.
60520	65780	That's funny. Margaret Thatcher says her science advisor in the policy unit was George
65780	71200	Guy's. Well, maybe Monckton was the man who advised her specifically on climate change.
71200	72800	After all, he says so himself.
72800	76800	Now, Margaret Thatcher, whom I used to advise on this question 25 years ago...
76800	82440	Nope, Margaret Thatcher disagrees. She specifically says George Guy's advised her on climate change,
82600	86980	as a result of which she made a speech about it to the Royal Society, and set up the Climatic
86980	88460	Research Unit.
88460	94460	So what role did Monckton play in her life? Well, let's take a look in the index. Molotov?
94460	96820	Molyneux? Monetarism?
96820	101580	In the entire 900-page autobiography, it seems Margaret Thatcher couldn't find room for a
101580	105780	single mention of one of her most important advisors.
105780	110220	To be fair to Monckton, he started out in his climate campaign freely admitting he has
110220	111940	no qualifications as a scientist.
111940	118200	So you may be thinking, what right does a non-scientist, albeit a former political advisor
118200	123580	to prime ministers, have to talk to us about the science of climate change?
123580	128740	What about that peer-reviewed scientific paper? No, Monckton never wrote one. He was invited
128740	133380	to submit an opinion piece to the newsletter of the American Physical Society as part of
133380	139300	a debate. This isn't one of the APS's peer-reviewed journals, it's a forum for opinions, as the
139300	144780	editorial statement of purpose shows. Monckton's insistence that his piece was peer-reviewed
144780	150500	even led the editor to publish a response, pointing out that it wasn't.
150500	154500	By now I'm sure a lot of Monckton fans will be saying, what does it matter if he isn't
154500	158780	a scientist? He was never Margaret Thatcher's science advisor and has never published a
158780	163580	scientific paper. If he's not presenting his own theories, but just correctly presenting
163580	169100	data and inferences from the scientific literature, he doesn't need a science background.
169100	175900	And I agree. But all this is conditional on these facts and these quotes being correct.
175900	180500	If anyone thinks we should unquestioningly believe whatever Monckton says, and that checking
180500	184900	his facts is somehow unfair, I'm going to call on someone who's going to support me
184900	186600	throughout these videos.
186600	192300	Skepticism is the highest of duties, blind faith, the one unpardonable sin.
192300	194500	Yes, Christopher Monckton himself.
194500	200700	Now I'm not going to give you, as he did in that film, my opinion about climate change,
200700	204100	because it is as worthless as his.
204100	211100	Everything I say, I can and will on request verify, either in the data or with equations
211100	213380	or in the peer-reviewed literature.
213380	217900	Then that makes things very easy. Where Mr Monckton gives sources, we can check them
217900	221940	to make sure he's quoting them correctly. Where he doesn't give sources, we'll find
221940	223700	out if he has any.
223700	228000	Because as we'll see later in this video, I wrote to Mr Monckton asking him to verify
228000	233660	certain facts and asking for his sources, but the results were quite extraordinary,
233660	237900	because I discovered that the person who can best debunk Christopher Monckton is Christopher
237900	240020	Monckton himself.
240020	241220	So where do we start?
241220	244820	So here's the first one.
244820	251760	We've had nine years of a global cooling trend since the first of January 2001.
251760	256200	There has been global cooling for the last eight or nine years.
256200	260280	Well, if Monckton is quoting from the data and the scientific literature, what does the
260280	263240	data and the scientific literature say about this?
263240	268080	A paper published in 2008 by the National Climate Centre in Australia looked at temperature
268080	273000	data from the world's three terrestrial temperature monitoring bodies and concluded,
273000	280040	In all three data sets, the linear trend over 1998-2007 is upward, i.e. one of warming,
280040	284640	even if the warming is weaker in the British data set than in the American data sets.
284640	289640	1998 was even warmer than Monckton's starting point, 2001.
289640	294560	In addition, an independent group of statisticians was given the raw data by the Associated Press
294560	297000	without being told what it was.
297000	302660	The experts found no true temperature declines over time.
302660	307160	And the AP quoted NOAA climate monitoring chief, Deke Arndt, as saying,
307160	310840	The last ten years are the warmest ten-year period of the modern record.
310840	315200	Even if you analyse the trend during that ten years, the trend is actually positive,
315200	317560	which means warming.
317560	322320	So if temperature monitoring bodies and reviewers and statisticians say the trend is up, what
322320	325780	experts is Monckton citing to show the trend is down?
325780	332020	And what that looks to me like is a fairly hefty, and indeed it is, statistically significant
332020	333160	rate of fall.
333160	335320	It turns out none.
335320	339940	Monckton is giving us his own opinion, and since he has no expertise in this field, he's
339940	344140	quite right to say that his opinion is as worthless as Al Gore's.
344140	348720	For a start, you can't tell statistical significance just by looking at a graph.
348720	353640	As I explained in an earlier video, statistically significant doesn't mean notable.
353640	357840	It has a specific mathematical meaning and has to be calculated.
357840	362020	But statistically significant or not, how did Monckton end up drawing a downward trend
362020	365940	line when all the experts insist that the trend is up?
365940	368380	It turns out the answer is very simple.
368380	372140	It all depends on where you choose your start and end points.
372140	376360	Global temperatures are subject to short-term cyclical factors, from the El Niño-southern
376360	380760	Oscillation every few years to the solar cycle every eleven years.
380760	385180	So if you choose a start and end point over a very short period of time, with strong warming
385180	390580	factors such as El Niño near the start, and an exceptional solar minimum towards the end,
390580	394580	these natural background fluctuations will skew the result.
394580	399660	John Grego, a professor of statistics at the University of South Carolina, told the AP,
399660	404740	if you look at the data and sort of cherry-pick a micro-trend within a bigger trend, that
404740	407860	technique is particularly suspect.
407860	412060	If Monckton fans find that hard to believe, I have someone here who'll tell you exactly
412060	413260	the same thing.
413260	417620	If you choose your start points and your end points carefully enough, you can make it look
417620	419820	as though any trend you want is happening.
419820	426900	We've had nine years of a global cooling trend since the first of January 2001.
426900	431120	So how do climate scientists and statisticians get around this problem?
431120	434020	As I explained in climate change, is the Earth cooling?
434020	438820	For one thing, they look at time periods over decades, rather than just a few years.
438820	443180	When you expand the timeline and look at the last few years in context, things look a little
443180	444340	different.
444340	449140	They can also correct this data for anomalies like the El Niño-southern Oscillation.
449140	454340	And most commonly, they even out the background fluctuations by taking a moving average every
454340	456180	5, 10 or 11 years.
456180	459460	That way, the underlying trend becomes clear.
459460	463580	Temperatures started moving upwards in the mid to late 1970s, and they're still moving
463580	469380	up today.
469380	474340	Then we go on to Arctic sea ice, which follows a regular kind of sine wave.
474340	476420	It comes and goes with the seasons.
476420	480480	There's lots of it during the winter, not so much during the summer.
480480	483900	Nothing particularly to worry about in that graph there.
483900	489940	In fact, there was a temporary loss of Arctic sea ice at the summer minimum in 2007.
489940	492260	That's the left-hand globe there.
492260	496060	But then by 2008, it's the purple area, which is the sea ice.
496060	499840	That's just the way the computer graphics from the satellite do it.
499840	502500	By 2008, half of that missing ice had come back.
502500	506500	By 2009, nearly all of it had come back.
506500	512700	So we're not looking at a sort of long-term, systematic loss of ice in the Arctic.
512700	516520	Now this surprised me, because research papers show there's been a steady loss of Arctic
516520	518220	sea ice for 30 years.
518220	522900	Since Moncton says everything he tells us comes from the data and the scientific literature,
522900	525620	then it should be easy to discover who's right.
525620	528320	All I needed was Moncton's source.
528320	533300	As so often happens, Moncton doesn't give a source, so I wrote to him asking for one,
533300	534760	and he wrote back,
534760	538920	For Arctic and Antarctic sea ice, see the monthly CO2 reports that I produce for the
538920	541160	Science and Public Policy Institute.
541160	543920	The graphs are all explained and sourced.
543920	549160	There was only one graph that specifically related to Arctic ice going back just 10 years,
549160	553620	and while the graph was sourced, the interpretation of it was not.
553620	558040	So I asked Moncton again for the sources that back up his claim that we're not looking at
558040	561680	a sort of long-term, systematic loss of ice in the Arctic.
561680	563720	He came back with this.
563720	568560	Arctic sea ice has indeed been declining in extent for 30 years, and the monthly CO2 reports
568560	570560	fairly reflect this.
570560	572440	What was that first bit again?
572440	576880	Arctic sea ice has indeed been declining in extent for 30 years, but didn't you just tell
576880	577880	everyone
577880	583640	We're not looking at a sort of long-term, systematic loss of ice in the Arctic.
583640	586640	Once again, which Moncton should we believe?
586640	591840	Speaking in the monthly CO2 report, Moncton does indeed accept that there has been a decline.
591840	596620	There has been a very slight decline in the trend of global sea ice extent over the decades,
596620	601040	chiefly attributable to a loss of sea ice in the Arctic during the summer.
601040	606400	So his preaching of no long-term decline is not only unsupported by the data and the scientific
606400	610020	literature, even Moncton accepts that it's wrong.
610020	614540	And yet the arguments he gives to his audiences seem absolutely convincing.
614540	617160	So let's see how Moncton managed to persuade them.
617160	621500	If you choose your start points and your end points carefully enough, you can make it look
621500	623920	as though any trend you want is happening.
623920	628620	In this case, Moncton's start point and end point were embarrassingly close together.
628620	635240	His start point was just two years earlier, in 2007, when ice extent was at a record low.
635240	640220	This wasn't primarily caused by global warming, it was the result of winds and currents.
640220	642260	And Moncton acknowledges this.
642280	647080	But there are 30 years of data going back to when satellite images were first taken.
647080	648940	This is what it shows.
648940	654040	As Moncton admits, when you press for a source, it's a 30-year decline.
654040	658420	And if we go back even further, we can see the last 30 years in context.
658420	662880	So Moncton seems to be giving one message to his audiences and in videos, but a very
662880	667400	different message if anyone takes the trouble to check his facts in more detail.
667400	671440	As I've said before, when someone makes a surprising claim, the best way to disprove
671440	675360	it is to force them to give up their source, however reluctantly.
675360	681120	90% of the time, finding the source or the non-existence of a source gets you to the truth.
684120	687120	How many of you have heard that Greenland is melting away?
687120	688960	Yes, that's right, you've all heard that.
688960	689960	Right.
689960	695800	Here is a paper by Johannessen et al., a very diligent Danish researcher using laser altimetry.
696160	704480	And what he found was that between 1992 and 2003, the average thickness of the vast Greenland
704480	708560	ice sheet increased by two inches a year.
708560	710680	Up to a point, Lord Copper.
710680	715360	Once again, resolving the differences between Moncton and the climatologists is fairly easy
715360	718440	because both claim to cite the scientific literature.
718440	724560	And here, Moncton actually gives us a source, a paper by Johannessen published in 2005.
724560	728520	If Johannessen's altimetry measurements show a thickening of the Greenland ice sheet, and
728520	732940	this is not disputed by other researchers, then Moncton doesn't need to convince me with
732940	735320	pictures of ice getting thicker.
735320	738600	What I am going to do is check what Moncton claims.
738600	741560	I'm going to read Johannessen's paper.
741560	745440	And it turns out he did not report that the average thickness of the Greenland ice sheet
745440	746580	has increased.
746580	750880	On the contrary, he says we can't make that assessment because his study only measured
750880	755440	the interior of Greenland at an altitude of 1500 metres or more.
755440	758840	The title of the paper alone should have been a clue.
758840	763840	It's conceivable, Johannessen says, that Greenland is losing more ice through ablation, that's
763840	769880	melting, at the lower altitudes than it's gaining ice at the higher altitudes he measured.
769880	773600	That's putting what he said into plain English, but if Moncton fans find it hard to believe
773600	779320	Moncton got this wrong, please pause the video and read what Johannessen wrote for yourselves.
779320	783120	Or look up the paper on the internet and read the whole thing.
783120	787000	And since that paper was published, other studies have shown that the ice loss at lower
787000	791200	altitudes is greater than the ice gain that Johannessen measured.
791200	794640	In other words, there's a net loss of ice from Greenland.
794640	798160	Two definitive papers were published in 2006.
798160	802320	So these were available to Moncton at the time he made his speeches, telling everyone
802320	804960	that there was no net loss.
804960	809300	Another thing that Moncton missed is Johannessen's conclusion that the increase in ice at higher
809300	815160	altitudes could be due to a decadal climate system like the North Atlantic Oscillation.
815160	819460	What's more, he says this increase was predicted by climate models.
819460	825060	I am simply going to tell you a series of facts from the science and the data and the
825060	831540	peer-reviewed literature, and I am going to allow you to draw the conclusion for yourselves.
831540	836060	I'm not going to presume that Moncton is deliberately trying to mislead his audiences.
836060	838380	As always, I can't discern motivation.
838380	842340	I can only check the information and show whether it's right or wrong.
842340	848220	But assuming Moncton is sincere in his beliefs, then there are only two possible conclusions.
848220	852380	Either he didn't read or he misunderstood the scientific studies that have measured
852380	854420	the loss of ice in Greenland.
854420	859460	And either he didn't read or he misunderstood the one paper he quoted upon which his entire
859460	861220	argument rests.
861220	864180	I would urge Moncton fans to do what I did.
864180	866460	If he doesn't give a source, be skeptical.
866460	868300	If he does give a source, read it.
868300	871100	And that's what the scientific method is about.
871100	872900	It's about checking.
872900	876900	Moncton gets so many things wrong, and it's so easy to show that he's wrong, that I've
876900	879580	got at least two more videos to do on him.
879580	883140	And in case they get removed from YouTube, please copy and mirror them.
