1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:19,720
In an interview with Ben Stein for the movie Expelled, he stated quite clearly that no

2
00:00:19,720 --> 00:00:23,680
one knows how life started and that there's a real possibility that life on this planet

3
00:00:23,680 --> 00:00:26,960
may have been seeded or influenced by higher forms of life.

4
00:00:26,960 --> 00:00:28,200
Here's a question.

5
00:00:28,200 --> 00:00:33,040
Why doesn't the what you ought to know guy actually show Dawkins saying that instead

6
00:00:33,040 --> 00:00:35,760
of just telling us he said it?

7
00:00:35,760 --> 00:00:37,600
After all, the clip is freely available.

8
00:00:37,600 --> 00:00:42,920
Well, you've probably guessed, because Dawkins never said it.

9
00:00:42,920 --> 00:00:47,480
So I will show the clip, but before I do, take a look at the transcript.

10
00:00:47,480 --> 00:00:50,760
Now read carefully and I hope you'll notice something odd.

11
00:00:50,760 --> 00:00:53,920
Ben Stein asks how heaven and earth got created.

12
00:00:53,920 --> 00:00:58,120
Dawkins says, quite rightly, that this was a very slow process.

13
00:00:58,120 --> 00:01:00,880
So Stein asks how it got started.

14
00:01:00,880 --> 00:01:04,920
Now here Dawkins could have explained about the Big Bang and the condensation of matter

15
00:01:04,920 --> 00:01:10,320
from a plasma of energy and the coming together of quantum particles to form atoms and how

16
00:01:10,320 --> 00:01:14,820
space expanded and these atoms were drawn together to form the first stars.

17
00:01:14,820 --> 00:01:17,960
But instead he says nobody knows how life started.

18
00:01:17,960 --> 00:01:22,200
Now why would Dawkins say that when the start of our universe has been understood since

19
00:01:22,200 --> 00:01:24,320
the 1950s?

20
00:01:24,320 --> 00:01:27,600
Then Dawkins' explanation gets even stranger.

21
00:01:27,600 --> 00:01:32,160
He says we know the sort of event that must have happened for the origin of life.

22
00:01:32,160 --> 00:01:34,160
The origin of life?

23
00:01:34,160 --> 00:01:38,160
But the origin of life has nothing to do with the origin of the universe.

24
00:01:38,160 --> 00:01:41,640
The two events are separated by about 10 billion years.

25
00:01:41,640 --> 00:01:45,840
Has Dawkins gone mad or did I miss something?

26
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:50,320
Well it turns out I did miss something and when we look at the interview itself we can

27
00:01:50,320 --> 00:01:52,000
see where it's gone missing.

28
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:55,360
Well then how did it get created?

29
00:01:55,360 --> 00:01:59,280
Well um by a very slow process.

30
00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:00,280
Well how did it start?

31
00:02:00,280 --> 00:02:02,460
Nobody knows how it got started.

32
00:02:02,460 --> 00:02:04,560
We know the kind of event that it must have been.

33
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:08,160
We know the sort of event that must have happened for the origin of life.

34
00:02:08,160 --> 00:02:13,600
Four very obvious cuts in both the audio and the video in the space of just a few seconds

35
00:02:13,600 --> 00:02:18,400
taking us from a question about the origin of the universe to an answer about the origin

36
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:19,400
of life.

37
00:02:19,600 --> 00:02:25,000
If you saw my video on TV tricks of the trade, and even if you didn't, it's not hard to spot

38
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:26,720
the very clumsy edits here.

39
00:02:26,720 --> 00:02:28,800
Right, how did that happen?

40
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:30,600
I told you we don't know.

41
00:02:30,600 --> 00:02:35,000
Dawkins could be answering no one knows to just about anything because we don't get to

42
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:37,180
hear what the question was.

43
00:02:37,180 --> 00:02:41,920
The giveaway is so clear that this kind of duplicitous editing wouldn't fool anyone.

44
00:02:41,920 --> 00:02:44,760
Oh okay, most people.

45
00:02:44,760 --> 00:02:49,040
But that's hardly enough to earn a golden crocoduck, so let's look at what does.

46
00:02:49,040 --> 00:02:52,800
There's a real possibility that life on this planet may have been seeded or influenced

47
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:54,200
by higher forms of life.

48
00:02:54,200 --> 00:02:58,000
Yes, this is the second thing Dawkins was supposed to have stated.

49
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:02,560
Now Dawkins has already said that life must have started with a self-replicating molecule.

50
00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:05,960
We know the sort of event that must have happened for the origin of life.

51
00:03:05,960 --> 00:03:06,960
What was that?

52
00:03:06,960 --> 00:03:11,060
It was the origin of the first self-replicating molecule.

53
00:03:11,060 --> 00:03:15,280
So isn't it odd that he suddenly starts talking about the possibility that we were designed

54
00:03:15,280 --> 00:03:17,400
by aliens from another planet?

55
00:03:17,760 --> 00:03:19,520
Are we missing something?

56
00:03:19,520 --> 00:03:20,520
Once again, yes.

57
00:03:20,520 --> 00:03:22,360
So you have no idea how it started?

58
00:03:22,360 --> 00:03:23,360
No, no.

59
00:03:23,360 --> 00:03:24,360
Nor has anybody.

60
00:03:24,360 --> 00:03:25,360
Nor has anyone else.

61
00:03:25,360 --> 00:03:30,600
What do you think is the possibility that intelligent design might turn out to be the

62
00:03:30,600 --> 00:03:35,600
answer to some issues in genetics or in evolution?

63
00:03:35,600 --> 00:03:37,460
It could come about in the following way.

64
00:03:37,460 --> 00:03:46,080
It could be that at some earlier time, somewhere in the universe, a civilization evolved.

65
00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:49,560
And once again, the question doesn't fit the answer.

66
00:03:49,560 --> 00:03:52,740
What do you think of the possibility of intelligent design?

67
00:03:52,740 --> 00:03:53,920
Should elicit the answer.

68
00:03:53,920 --> 00:03:57,240
Well, anything's possible, but it's very unlikely.

69
00:03:57,240 --> 00:04:02,000
So if Dawkins's answer is, it could come about in the following way, then the question must

70
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:03,000
have been different.

71
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:07,160
I was going to suggest that Stein's question must have been something like, if there was

72
00:04:07,160 --> 00:04:10,560
intelligent design, how might it have come about?

73
00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:14,680
But then I came across this interview with Dawkins in which he told us the question that

74
00:04:14,680 --> 00:04:15,680
was put to him.

75
00:04:16,080 --> 00:04:21,440
So when Ben Stein, who was the compare of the infamous, expelled film that some of you

76
00:04:21,440 --> 00:04:26,360
may have heard of, asked me in an interview whether I could think of any circumstances

77
00:04:26,360 --> 00:04:32,200
in which I could remotely think that intelligent design of life on Earth was plausible.

78
00:04:32,200 --> 00:04:35,200
And of course that fits perfectly with his answer.

79
00:04:35,200 --> 00:04:38,520
Now, does it matter how he was led into this question?

80
00:04:38,520 --> 00:04:40,720
After all, he did say it was a possibility.

81
00:04:41,240 --> 00:04:45,320
Yes, but the conditions that he was given, that he had to come up with some way that

82
00:04:45,320 --> 00:04:48,960
intelligent design might have happened, have been cut.

83
00:04:48,960 --> 00:04:53,240
After all, I could ask Ben Stein if it's possible Richard Nixon was gay.

84
00:04:53,240 --> 00:04:57,320
And if he's honest, he would have to say yes, of course it's possible.

85
00:04:57,320 --> 00:05:02,720
Pat could have been a cover, but would it then be fair to write this headline?

86
00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:06,020
Stein claims possible Nixon was gay.

87
00:05:06,020 --> 00:05:10,940
And if all Stein did was admit to the possibility if all other options are taken away, then

88
00:05:10,940 --> 00:05:16,940
it would be even more of a distortion to write, Stein claims real possibility Nixon was gay.

89
00:05:16,940 --> 00:05:21,160
And finally, Stein claims Nixon was gay.

90
00:05:21,160 --> 00:05:24,360
And that's where this misquote of Dawkins takes us.

91
00:05:24,360 --> 00:05:29,740
From a hypothetical possibility if the option of abiogenesis is taken away, to a possibility

92
00:05:29,740 --> 00:05:33,120
that it happened, to a real possibility that it happened.

93
00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:36,880
There's a real possibility that life on this planet may have been seeded or influenced

94
00:05:36,880 --> 00:05:38,360
by higher forms of life.

95
00:05:38,360 --> 00:05:41,400
And then to Dawkins saying it actually happened.

96
00:05:41,400 --> 00:05:45,120
It's wonderful what you can do with these one-off quotes and a complete disregard for

97
00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:50,840
the truth, simply to score a few silly brownie points in support of your religion.

98
00:05:50,840 --> 00:05:53,520
Potholer needs to be filled in on thermodynamics.

99
00:05:53,520 --> 00:05:58,560
I promise this wasn't nominated by me, but Ian Juby refers to me in this video.

100
00:05:58,560 --> 00:06:13,920
And this begs exactly the same question I put to the previous nominee, why is it that

101
00:06:13,920 --> 00:06:19,200
Ian doesn't show a clip from my video where I cite snowflakes and sunflowers as examples

102
00:06:19,200 --> 00:06:23,080
of how energy from the sun causes life to arise on earth?

103
00:06:23,080 --> 00:06:27,360
He tells people I said this, so why not actually show me saying it?

104
00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:31,880
Well, the answer is, of course, because there are no clips of me saying that.

105
00:06:31,880 --> 00:06:36,960
Ironically, in trying to criticise a video called Setting Fire to Creationist Strawmen,

106
00:06:36,960 --> 00:06:40,480
Juby has set up his own creationist strawman.

107
00:06:40,480 --> 00:06:46,180
In his a bit of advice, in my videos I always play the clip or show the quote I'm critiquing

108
00:06:46,180 --> 00:06:50,740
so that there can be no question that I've misinterpreted or misquoted it, or simply

109
00:06:50,740 --> 00:06:53,440
made it up out of thin air.

110
00:06:53,440 --> 00:06:58,600
So here's what I actually said about sunflowers and snowflakes in response to a nominee called

111
00:06:58,600 --> 00:07:00,340
the atheist antidote.

112
00:07:00,340 --> 00:07:04,760
He claimed the second law of thermodynamics supports creationism because it says the whole

113
00:07:04,760 --> 00:07:11,640
universe is running down into complete disorder.

114
00:07:11,640 --> 00:07:16,200
Now I say quite explicitly that I was using the example of snowflakes and sunflowers and

115
00:07:16,200 --> 00:07:21,240
geodes to show that there is a tendency for the universe to run down into disorder.

116
00:07:21,240 --> 00:07:26,360
No one, apart from creationists, has ever defined the second law as the whole universe

117
00:07:26,360 --> 00:07:29,240
running down into complete disorder.

118
00:07:29,240 --> 00:07:33,520
After all, we only need to look around us to see that that isn't the case.

119
00:07:33,520 --> 00:07:38,180
Plant a sunflower seed and it grows into a flower that can turn to face the sun.

120
00:07:38,180 --> 00:07:43,700
When water evaporates and rises haphazardly into the atmosphere, it turns into exquisitely

121
00:07:43,700 --> 00:07:45,460
ordered snowflakes.

122
00:07:45,460 --> 00:07:49,600
As long as the snowflake eventually melts, the sunflower dies and the geode eventually

123
00:07:49,600 --> 00:07:54,860
gets remelted, then every example of order is in perfect conformity with the second

124
00:07:54,860 --> 00:07:55,860
law.

125
00:07:55,860 --> 00:08:00,360
Obviously, Ian couldn't find anything wrong with that statement, so he made something

126
00:08:00,360 --> 00:08:01,360
up.

127
00:08:01,360 --> 00:08:17,320
It's not true, but that's why we have the golden crocoduck.

128
00:08:17,320 --> 00:08:22,120
Once again, Juby doesn't show a clip of me comparing a snowflake to a sunflower, because

129
00:08:22,120 --> 00:08:25,360
as you've just seen, he doesn't have one.

130
00:08:25,360 --> 00:08:29,280
From this he seems to go completely off the rails, like saying that because a rock formed

131
00:08:29,280 --> 00:08:33,920
by natural processes, we can therefore conclude that the space shuttle can also form by natural

132
00:08:33,920 --> 00:08:34,920
processes.

133
00:08:34,920 --> 00:08:36,800
Yeah, good point Ian.

134
00:08:36,800 --> 00:08:41,640
And so here's Juby's conclusion, and apparently he still thinks he's arguing with something

135
00:08:41,640 --> 00:08:42,640
I said.

136
00:08:42,640 --> 00:08:51,840
Well yes, Ian, that's exactly what I spent five minutes explaining, in a clip that you

137
00:08:51,840 --> 00:08:56,340
could quite easily have shown people if you wanted to rebut what I was saying.

138
00:08:56,340 --> 00:09:01,160
In fact, reality complies very nicely with the second law of thermodynamics, which says

139
00:09:01,160 --> 00:09:05,700
there's a tendency towards disorder in a closed system.

140
00:09:05,700 --> 00:09:09,340
And evolution complies very nicely also, on two counts.

141
00:09:09,340 --> 00:09:12,320
First, there is a tendency towards disorder in a closed system.

142
00:09:12,320 --> 00:09:16,280
I know, it's definitely more trouble and more time consuming to download the videos

143
00:09:16,280 --> 00:09:19,800
you're critiquing and find the clips you want to rebut.

144
00:09:19,800 --> 00:09:24,320
But at least my subscribers know that they're not being thrown a straw man because I always

145
00:09:24,320 --> 00:09:29,200
show them what someone actually says, rather than make up some spurious claim about what

146
00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:30,660
they said.

147
00:09:30,660 --> 00:09:35,840
And if you do that, you're less likely to slip up and get nominated for a golden crocoduck.
