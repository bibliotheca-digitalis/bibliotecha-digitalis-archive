00:00.000 --> 00:19.720
In an interview with Ben Stein for the movie Expelled, he stated quite clearly that no

00:19.720 --> 00:23.680
one knows how life started and that there's a real possibility that life on this planet

00:23.680 --> 00:26.960
may have been seeded or influenced by higher forms of life.

00:26.960 --> 00:28.200
Here's a question.

00:28.200 --> 00:33.040
Why doesn't the what you ought to know guy actually show Dawkins saying that instead

00:33.040 --> 00:35.760
of just telling us he said it?

00:35.760 --> 00:37.600
After all, the clip is freely available.

00:37.600 --> 00:42.920
Well, you've probably guessed, because Dawkins never said it.

00:42.920 --> 00:47.480
So I will show the clip, but before I do, take a look at the transcript.

00:47.480 --> 00:50.760
Now read carefully and I hope you'll notice something odd.

00:50.760 --> 00:53.920
Ben Stein asks how heaven and earth got created.

00:53.920 --> 00:58.120
Dawkins says, quite rightly, that this was a very slow process.

00:58.120 --> 01:00.880
So Stein asks how it got started.

01:00.880 --> 01:04.920
Now here Dawkins could have explained about the Big Bang and the condensation of matter

01:04.920 --> 01:10.320
from a plasma of energy and the coming together of quantum particles to form atoms and how

01:10.320 --> 01:14.820
space expanded and these atoms were drawn together to form the first stars.

01:14.820 --> 01:17.960
But instead he says nobody knows how life started.

01:17.960 --> 01:22.200
Now why would Dawkins say that when the start of our universe has been understood since

01:22.200 --> 01:24.320
the 1950s?

01:24.320 --> 01:27.600
Then Dawkins' explanation gets even stranger.

01:27.600 --> 01:32.160
He says we know the sort of event that must have happened for the origin of life.

01:32.160 --> 01:34.160
The origin of life?

01:34.160 --> 01:38.160
But the origin of life has nothing to do with the origin of the universe.

01:38.160 --> 01:41.640
The two events are separated by about 10 billion years.

01:41.640 --> 01:45.840
Has Dawkins gone mad or did I miss something?

01:45.840 --> 01:50.320
Well it turns out I did miss something and when we look at the interview itself we can

01:50.320 --> 01:52.000
see where it's gone missing.

01:52.000 --> 01:55.360
Well then how did it get created?

01:55.360 --> 01:59.280
Well um by a very slow process.

01:59.280 --> 02:00.280
Well how did it start?

02:00.280 --> 02:02.460
Nobody knows how it got started.

02:02.460 --> 02:04.560
We know the kind of event that it must have been.

02:04.560 --> 02:08.160
We know the sort of event that must have happened for the origin of life.

02:08.160 --> 02:13.600
Four very obvious cuts in both the audio and the video in the space of just a few seconds

02:13.600 --> 02:18.400
taking us from a question about the origin of the universe to an answer about the origin

02:18.400 --> 02:19.400
of life.

02:19.600 --> 02:25.000
If you saw my video on TV tricks of the trade, and even if you didn't, it's not hard to spot

02:25.000 --> 02:26.720
the very clumsy edits here.

02:26.720 --> 02:28.800
Right, how did that happen?

02:28.800 --> 02:30.600
I told you we don't know.

02:30.600 --> 02:35.000
Dawkins could be answering no one knows to just about anything because we don't get to

02:35.000 --> 02:37.180
hear what the question was.

02:37.180 --> 02:41.920
The giveaway is so clear that this kind of duplicitous editing wouldn't fool anyone.

02:41.920 --> 02:44.760
Oh okay, most people.

02:44.760 --> 02:49.040
But that's hardly enough to earn a golden crocoduck, so let's look at what does.

02:49.040 --> 02:52.800
There's a real possibility that life on this planet may have been seeded or influenced

02:52.800 --> 02:54.200
by higher forms of life.

02:54.200 --> 02:58.000
Yes, this is the second thing Dawkins was supposed to have stated.

02:58.000 --> 03:02.560
Now Dawkins has already said that life must have started with a self-replicating molecule.

03:02.560 --> 03:05.960
We know the sort of event that must have happened for the origin of life.

03:05.960 --> 03:06.960
What was that?

03:06.960 --> 03:11.060
It was the origin of the first self-replicating molecule.

03:11.060 --> 03:15.280
So isn't it odd that he suddenly starts talking about the possibility that we were designed

03:15.280 --> 03:17.400
by aliens from another planet?

03:17.760 --> 03:19.520
Are we missing something?

03:19.520 --> 03:20.520
Once again, yes.

03:20.520 --> 03:22.360
So you have no idea how it started?

03:22.360 --> 03:23.360
No, no.

03:23.360 --> 03:24.360
Nor has anybody.

03:24.360 --> 03:25.360
Nor has anyone else.

03:25.360 --> 03:30.600
What do you think is the possibility that intelligent design might turn out to be the

03:30.600 --> 03:35.600
answer to some issues in genetics or in evolution?

03:35.600 --> 03:37.460
It could come about in the following way.

03:37.460 --> 03:46.080
It could be that at some earlier time, somewhere in the universe, a civilization evolved.

03:46.080 --> 03:49.560
And once again, the question doesn't fit the answer.

03:49.560 --> 03:52.740
What do you think of the possibility of intelligent design?

03:52.740 --> 03:53.920
Should elicit the answer.

03:53.920 --> 03:57.240
Well, anything's possible, but it's very unlikely.

03:57.240 --> 04:02.000
So if Dawkins's answer is, it could come about in the following way, then the question must

04:02.000 --> 04:03.000
have been different.

04:03.000 --> 04:07.160
I was going to suggest that Stein's question must have been something like, if there was

04:07.160 --> 04:10.560
intelligent design, how might it have come about?

04:10.560 --> 04:14.680
But then I came across this interview with Dawkins in which he told us the question that

04:14.680 --> 04:15.680
was put to him.

04:16.080 --> 04:21.440
So when Ben Stein, who was the compare of the infamous, expelled film that some of you

04:21.440 --> 04:26.360
may have heard of, asked me in an interview whether I could think of any circumstances

04:26.360 --> 04:32.200
in which I could remotely think that intelligent design of life on Earth was plausible.

04:32.200 --> 04:35.200
And of course that fits perfectly with his answer.

04:35.200 --> 04:38.520
Now, does it matter how he was led into this question?

04:38.520 --> 04:40.720
After all, he did say it was a possibility.

04:41.240 --> 04:45.320
Yes, but the conditions that he was given, that he had to come up with some way that

04:45.320 --> 04:48.960
intelligent design might have happened, have been cut.

04:48.960 --> 04:53.240
After all, I could ask Ben Stein if it's possible Richard Nixon was gay.

04:53.240 --> 04:57.320
And if he's honest, he would have to say yes, of course it's possible.

04:57.320 --> 05:02.720
Pat could have been a cover, but would it then be fair to write this headline?

05:02.720 --> 05:06.020
Stein claims possible Nixon was gay.

05:06.020 --> 05:10.940
And if all Stein did was admit to the possibility if all other options are taken away, then

05:10.940 --> 05:16.940
it would be even more of a distortion to write, Stein claims real possibility Nixon was gay.

05:16.940 --> 05:21.160
And finally, Stein claims Nixon was gay.

05:21.160 --> 05:24.360
And that's where this misquote of Dawkins takes us.

05:24.360 --> 05:29.740
From a hypothetical possibility if the option of abiogenesis is taken away, to a possibility

05:29.740 --> 05:33.120
that it happened, to a real possibility that it happened.

05:33.120 --> 05:36.880
There's a real possibility that life on this planet may have been seeded or influenced

05:36.880 --> 05:38.360
by higher forms of life.

05:38.360 --> 05:41.400
And then to Dawkins saying it actually happened.

05:41.400 --> 05:45.120
It's wonderful what you can do with these one-off quotes and a complete disregard for

05:45.120 --> 05:50.840
the truth, simply to score a few silly brownie points in support of your religion.

05:50.840 --> 05:53.520
Potholer needs to be filled in on thermodynamics.

05:53.520 --> 05:58.560
I promise this wasn't nominated by me, but Ian Juby refers to me in this video.

05:58.560 --> 06:13.920
And this begs exactly the same question I put to the previous nominee, why is it that

06:13.920 --> 06:19.200
Ian doesn't show a clip from my video where I cite snowflakes and sunflowers as examples

06:19.200 --> 06:23.080
of how energy from the sun causes life to arise on earth?

06:23.080 --> 06:27.360
He tells people I said this, so why not actually show me saying it?

06:27.360 --> 06:31.880
Well, the answer is, of course, because there are no clips of me saying that.

06:31.880 --> 06:36.960
Ironically, in trying to criticise a video called Setting Fire to Creationist Strawmen,

06:36.960 --> 06:40.480
Juby has set up his own creationist strawman.

06:40.480 --> 06:46.180
In his a bit of advice, in my videos I always play the clip or show the quote I'm critiquing

06:46.180 --> 06:50.740
so that there can be no question that I've misinterpreted or misquoted it, or simply

06:50.740 --> 06:53.440
made it up out of thin air.

06:53.440 --> 06:58.600
So here's what I actually said about sunflowers and snowflakes in response to a nominee called

06:58.600 --> 07:00.340
the atheist antidote.

07:00.340 --> 07:04.760
He claimed the second law of thermodynamics supports creationism because it says the whole

07:04.760 --> 07:11.640
universe is running down into complete disorder.

07:11.640 --> 07:16.200
Now I say quite explicitly that I was using the example of snowflakes and sunflowers and

07:16.200 --> 07:21.240
geodes to show that there is a tendency for the universe to run down into disorder.

07:21.240 --> 07:26.360
No one, apart from creationists, has ever defined the second law as the whole universe

07:26.360 --> 07:29.240
running down into complete disorder.

07:29.240 --> 07:33.520
After all, we only need to look around us to see that that isn't the case.

07:33.520 --> 07:38.180
Plant a sunflower seed and it grows into a flower that can turn to face the sun.

07:38.180 --> 07:43.700
When water evaporates and rises haphazardly into the atmosphere, it turns into exquisitely

07:43.700 --> 07:45.460
ordered snowflakes.

07:45.460 --> 07:49.600
As long as the snowflake eventually melts, the sunflower dies and the geode eventually

07:49.600 --> 07:54.860
gets remelted, then every example of order is in perfect conformity with the second

07:54.860 --> 07:55.860
law.

07:55.860 --> 08:00.360
Obviously, Ian couldn't find anything wrong with that statement, so he made something

08:00.360 --> 08:01.360
up.

08:01.360 --> 08:17.320
It's not true, but that's why we have the golden crocoduck.

08:17.320 --> 08:22.120
Once again, Juby doesn't show a clip of me comparing a snowflake to a sunflower, because

08:22.120 --> 08:25.360
as you've just seen, he doesn't have one.

08:25.360 --> 08:29.280
From this he seems to go completely off the rails, like saying that because a rock formed

08:29.280 --> 08:33.920
by natural processes, we can therefore conclude that the space shuttle can also form by natural

08:33.920 --> 08:34.920
processes.

08:34.920 --> 08:36.800
Yeah, good point Ian.

08:36.800 --> 08:41.640
And so here's Juby's conclusion, and apparently he still thinks he's arguing with something

08:41.640 --> 08:42.640
I said.

08:42.640 --> 08:51.840
Well yes, Ian, that's exactly what I spent five minutes explaining, in a clip that you

08:51.840 --> 08:56.340
could quite easily have shown people if you wanted to rebut what I was saying.

08:56.340 --> 09:01.160
In fact, reality complies very nicely with the second law of thermodynamics, which says

09:01.160 --> 09:05.700
there's a tendency towards disorder in a closed system.

09:05.700 --> 09:09.340
And evolution complies very nicely also, on two counts.

09:09.340 --> 09:12.320
First, there is a tendency towards disorder in a closed system.

09:12.320 --> 09:16.280
I know, it's definitely more trouble and more time consuming to download the videos

09:16.280 --> 09:19.800
you're critiquing and find the clips you want to rebut.

09:19.800 --> 09:24.320
But at least my subscribers know that they're not being thrown a straw man because I always

09:24.320 --> 09:29.200
show them what someone actually says, rather than make up some spurious claim about what

09:29.200 --> 09:30.660
they said.

09:30.660 --> 09:35.840
And if you do that, you're less likely to slip up and get nominated for a golden crocoduck.
