0	19720	In an interview with Ben Stein for the movie Expelled, he stated quite clearly that no
19720	23680	one knows how life started and that there's a real possibility that life on this planet
23680	26960	may have been seeded or influenced by higher forms of life.
26960	28200	Here's a question.
28200	33040	Why doesn't the what you ought to know guy actually show Dawkins saying that instead
33040	35760	of just telling us he said it?
35760	37600	After all, the clip is freely available.
37600	42920	Well, you've probably guessed, because Dawkins never said it.
42920	47480	So I will show the clip, but before I do, take a look at the transcript.
47480	50760	Now read carefully and I hope you'll notice something odd.
50760	53920	Ben Stein asks how heaven and earth got created.
53920	58120	Dawkins says, quite rightly, that this was a very slow process.
58120	60880	So Stein asks how it got started.
60880	64920	Now here Dawkins could have explained about the Big Bang and the condensation of matter
64920	70320	from a plasma of energy and the coming together of quantum particles to form atoms and how
70320	74820	space expanded and these atoms were drawn together to form the first stars.
74820	77960	But instead he says nobody knows how life started.
77960	82200	Now why would Dawkins say that when the start of our universe has been understood since
82200	84320	the 1950s?
84320	87600	Then Dawkins' explanation gets even stranger.
87600	92160	He says we know the sort of event that must have happened for the origin of life.
92160	94160	The origin of life?
94160	98160	But the origin of life has nothing to do with the origin of the universe.
98160	101640	The two events are separated by about 10 billion years.
101640	105840	Has Dawkins gone mad or did I miss something?
105840	110320	Well it turns out I did miss something and when we look at the interview itself we can
110320	112000	see where it's gone missing.
112000	115360	Well then how did it get created?
115360	119280	Well um by a very slow process.
119280	120280	Well how did it start?
120280	122460	Nobody knows how it got started.
122460	124560	We know the kind of event that it must have been.
124560	128160	We know the sort of event that must have happened for the origin of life.
128160	133600	Four very obvious cuts in both the audio and the video in the space of just a few seconds
133600	138400	taking us from a question about the origin of the universe to an answer about the origin
138400	139400	of life.
139600	145000	If you saw my video on TV tricks of the trade, and even if you didn't, it's not hard to spot
145000	146720	the very clumsy edits here.
146720	148800	Right, how did that happen?
148800	150600	I told you we don't know.
150600	155000	Dawkins could be answering no one knows to just about anything because we don't get to
155000	157180	hear what the question was.
157180	161920	The giveaway is so clear that this kind of duplicitous editing wouldn't fool anyone.
161920	164760	Oh okay, most people.
164760	169040	But that's hardly enough to earn a golden crocoduck, so let's look at what does.
169040	172800	There's a real possibility that life on this planet may have been seeded or influenced
172800	174200	by higher forms of life.
174200	178000	Yes, this is the second thing Dawkins was supposed to have stated.
178000	182560	Now Dawkins has already said that life must have started with a self-replicating molecule.
182560	185960	We know the sort of event that must have happened for the origin of life.
185960	186960	What was that?
186960	191060	It was the origin of the first self-replicating molecule.
191060	195280	So isn't it odd that he suddenly starts talking about the possibility that we were designed
195280	197400	by aliens from another planet?
197760	199520	Are we missing something?
199520	200520	Once again, yes.
200520	202360	So you have no idea how it started?
202360	203360	No, no.
203360	204360	Nor has anybody.
204360	205360	Nor has anyone else.
205360	210600	What do you think is the possibility that intelligent design might turn out to be the
210600	215600	answer to some issues in genetics or in evolution?
215600	217460	It could come about in the following way.
217460	226080	It could be that at some earlier time, somewhere in the universe, a civilization evolved.
226080	229560	And once again, the question doesn't fit the answer.
229560	232740	What do you think of the possibility of intelligent design?
232740	233920	Should elicit the answer.
233920	237240	Well, anything's possible, but it's very unlikely.
237240	242000	So if Dawkins's answer is, it could come about in the following way, then the question must
242000	243000	have been different.
243000	247160	I was going to suggest that Stein's question must have been something like, if there was
247160	250560	intelligent design, how might it have come about?
250560	254680	But then I came across this interview with Dawkins in which he told us the question that
254680	255680	was put to him.
256080	261440	So when Ben Stein, who was the compare of the infamous, expelled film that some of you
261440	266360	may have heard of, asked me in an interview whether I could think of any circumstances
266360	272200	in which I could remotely think that intelligent design of life on Earth was plausible.
272200	275200	And of course that fits perfectly with his answer.
275200	278520	Now, does it matter how he was led into this question?
278520	280720	After all, he did say it was a possibility.
281240	285320	Yes, but the conditions that he was given, that he had to come up with some way that
285320	288960	intelligent design might have happened, have been cut.
288960	293240	After all, I could ask Ben Stein if it's possible Richard Nixon was gay.
293240	297320	And if he's honest, he would have to say yes, of course it's possible.
297320	302720	Pat could have been a cover, but would it then be fair to write this headline?
302720	306020	Stein claims possible Nixon was gay.
306020	310940	And if all Stein did was admit to the possibility if all other options are taken away, then
310940	316940	it would be even more of a distortion to write, Stein claims real possibility Nixon was gay.
316940	321160	And finally, Stein claims Nixon was gay.
321160	324360	And that's where this misquote of Dawkins takes us.
324360	329740	From a hypothetical possibility if the option of abiogenesis is taken away, to a possibility
329740	333120	that it happened, to a real possibility that it happened.
333120	336880	There's a real possibility that life on this planet may have been seeded or influenced
336880	338360	by higher forms of life.
338360	341400	And then to Dawkins saying it actually happened.
341400	345120	It's wonderful what you can do with these one-off quotes and a complete disregard for
345120	350840	the truth, simply to score a few silly brownie points in support of your religion.
350840	353520	Potholer needs to be filled in on thermodynamics.
353520	358560	I promise this wasn't nominated by me, but Ian Juby refers to me in this video.
358560	373920	And this begs exactly the same question I put to the previous nominee, why is it that
373920	379200	Ian doesn't show a clip from my video where I cite snowflakes and sunflowers as examples
379200	383080	of how energy from the sun causes life to arise on earth?
383080	387360	He tells people I said this, so why not actually show me saying it?
387360	391880	Well, the answer is, of course, because there are no clips of me saying that.
391880	396960	Ironically, in trying to criticise a video called Setting Fire to Creationist Strawmen,
396960	400480	Juby has set up his own creationist strawman.
400480	406180	In his a bit of advice, in my videos I always play the clip or show the quote I'm critiquing
406180	410740	so that there can be no question that I've misinterpreted or misquoted it, or simply
410740	413440	made it up out of thin air.
413440	418600	So here's what I actually said about sunflowers and snowflakes in response to a nominee called
418600	420340	the atheist antidote.
420340	424760	He claimed the second law of thermodynamics supports creationism because it says the whole
424760	431640	universe is running down into complete disorder.
431640	436200	Now I say quite explicitly that I was using the example of snowflakes and sunflowers and
436200	441240	geodes to show that there is a tendency for the universe to run down into disorder.
441240	446360	No one, apart from creationists, has ever defined the second law as the whole universe
446360	449240	running down into complete disorder.
449240	453520	After all, we only need to look around us to see that that isn't the case.
453520	458180	Plant a sunflower seed and it grows into a flower that can turn to face the sun.
458180	463700	When water evaporates and rises haphazardly into the atmosphere, it turns into exquisitely
463700	465460	ordered snowflakes.
465460	469600	As long as the snowflake eventually melts, the sunflower dies and the geode eventually
469600	474860	gets remelted, then every example of order is in perfect conformity with the second
474860	475860	law.
475860	480360	Obviously, Ian couldn't find anything wrong with that statement, so he made something
480360	481360	up.
481360	497320	It's not true, but that's why we have the golden crocoduck.
497320	502120	Once again, Juby doesn't show a clip of me comparing a snowflake to a sunflower, because
502120	505360	as you've just seen, he doesn't have one.
505360	509280	From this he seems to go completely off the rails, like saying that because a rock formed
509280	513920	by natural processes, we can therefore conclude that the space shuttle can also form by natural
513920	514920	processes.
514920	516800	Yeah, good point Ian.
516800	521640	And so here's Juby's conclusion, and apparently he still thinks he's arguing with something
521640	522640	I said.
522640	531840	Well yes, Ian, that's exactly what I spent five minutes explaining, in a clip that you
531840	536340	could quite easily have shown people if you wanted to rebut what I was saying.
536340	541160	In fact, reality complies very nicely with the second law of thermodynamics, which says
541160	545700	there's a tendency towards disorder in a closed system.
545700	549340	And evolution complies very nicely also, on two counts.
549340	552320	First, there is a tendency towards disorder in a closed system.
552320	556280	I know, it's definitely more trouble and more time consuming to download the videos
556280	559800	you're critiquing and find the clips you want to rebut.
559800	564320	But at least my subscribers know that they're not being thrown a straw man because I always
564320	569200	show them what someone actually says, rather than make up some spurious claim about what
569200	570660	they said.
570660	575840	And if you do that, you're less likely to slip up and get nominated for a golden crocoduck.
