1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,780
Um, well, yeah, conspiracies exist, come on, say it with me, conspiracy, conspiracy.

2
00:00:10,780 --> 00:00:12,640
Conspiracy theorists, I have a complaint.

3
00:00:12,640 --> 00:00:13,640
You want a complaint?

4
00:00:13,640 --> 00:00:16,200
Look at these shoes, I've only had them three weeks, now it's in your pocket.

5
00:00:16,200 --> 00:00:17,200
Shut up.

6
00:00:17,200 --> 00:00:19,240
It's about this conspiracy you tried to sell me.

7
00:00:19,240 --> 00:00:23,680
I had a salesman show up at the door two years ago with what seemed like an incredible story

8
00:00:23,680 --> 00:00:29,800
of fabricated evidence and dishonest scientists, and at first I have to admit I was taken in.

9
00:00:29,800 --> 00:00:32,320
Especially by this.

10
00:00:32,320 --> 00:00:34,560
But then I did some checking.

11
00:00:34,560 --> 00:00:39,920
Now your salesman told me that hiding the decline referred to a decline in global temperatures,

12
00:00:39,920 --> 00:00:44,440
but when I read the actual email from which this quote was lifted, it turned out that

13
00:00:44,440 --> 00:00:50,320
he was talking about proxies, and a well-known phenomenon called the divergence problem.

14
00:00:50,320 --> 00:00:55,320
But a lot of people are so gullible they'll still believe anything your salesman say,

15
00:00:55,320 --> 00:00:59,600
and they were so convinced by this sales pitch two years ago they still cling to the belief

16
00:00:59,600 --> 00:01:04,320
that the decline refers to global temperatures.

17
00:01:04,320 --> 00:01:08,600
Now that bloody salesman is back again, peddling the same thing.

18
00:01:08,600 --> 00:01:12,940
Five thousand emails, which filled twenty-five thousand pages when I put them into plain

19
00:01:12,940 --> 00:01:16,400
text, of supposed fraud and conspiracy.

20
00:01:16,400 --> 00:01:20,880
Okay, I admit that at first I was sucked in, just like last time.

21
00:01:20,880 --> 00:01:25,200
I read a couple of emails which talked about destroying documents before any freedom of

22
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:30,000
information request is received, and I thought, they're at it again.

23
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:34,560
Ah, then I realised of course that these five thousand emails aren't new.

24
00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:37,920
They're part of the same batch that was leaked in 2009.

25
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:41,680
Look, we already knew they were keeping their data secret.

26
00:01:41,680 --> 00:01:46,520
I and many others criticised them for it, and since then they've released all the data.

27
00:01:46,520 --> 00:01:49,400
So it's kind of old news.

28
00:01:49,400 --> 00:01:51,360
Some of the emails aren't even new.

29
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:56,560
I thought I recognised this one, and yes, it's exactly the same email that was released

30
00:01:56,560 --> 00:01:59,260
with the first batch in 2009.

31
00:01:59,260 --> 00:02:01,380
By the way, I fell for this one too.

32
00:02:01,380 --> 00:02:05,080
It turns out the figure being discussed isn't man's.

33
00:02:05,080 --> 00:02:10,560
So not only are these emails contemporaneous, some of them, I have no idea how many, are

34
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:12,520
identical.

35
00:02:12,520 --> 00:02:16,440
Now the problem I had with the salesman last time was that he was simply giving me quotes

36
00:02:16,440 --> 00:02:20,680
that looked sinister, but when you actually read them in the context of the emails they

37
00:02:20,680 --> 00:02:24,200
turned out to be just part of a debate about the science.

38
00:02:24,200 --> 00:02:27,800
So I thought at least this time your salesman would have a different approach.

39
00:02:27,800 --> 00:02:33,560
You know, show the whole email, explain what it's about and how it shows a conspiracy.

40
00:02:33,560 --> 00:02:36,360
Ah, but no.

41
00:02:36,360 --> 00:02:39,480
Here's a popular one, reprinted in the Daily Mail.

42
00:02:39,480 --> 00:02:44,560
The trick may be to decide on the main message and use that to guide what's included and

43
00:02:44,560 --> 00:02:45,920
what's left out.

44
00:02:45,920 --> 00:02:48,680
Ooh, sounds suspicious, right?

45
00:02:48,680 --> 00:02:52,360
But here's what Jonathan Overpeck said in context.

46
00:02:52,360 --> 00:02:57,040
He's talking about condensing a lot of information into a small amount of space.

47
00:02:57,040 --> 00:03:01,400
And that's why, he says, the trick may be to decide on the main message and use that

48
00:03:01,400 --> 00:03:04,400
to guide what's included and what's left out.

49
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:09,680
For the IPCC, we need to know what is relevant and useful for assessing recent and future

50
00:03:09,680 --> 00:03:10,960
climate change.

51
00:03:10,960 --> 00:03:16,740
Moreover, we have to have solid data, not inconclusive information.

52
00:03:16,740 --> 00:03:19,840
So that paints a very different picture.

53
00:03:19,840 --> 00:03:24,820
This quote, which was widely circulated, is not only not a complete email, it's not even

54
00:03:24,820 --> 00:03:26,500
a complete sentence.

55
00:03:26,500 --> 00:03:28,420
The first part has been chopped off.

56
00:03:28,420 --> 00:03:32,860
Ironic that you're trying to sell me a story about deceptive science by showing me a quote

57
00:03:32,860 --> 00:03:35,520
that itself is deceptive.

58
00:03:35,520 --> 00:03:38,460
And here's the whole thing in context.

59
00:03:38,460 --> 00:03:43,700
Now a Financial Times columnist told us this email referred to the science of climate change

60
00:03:43,700 --> 00:03:46,860
being manipulated for political purposes.

61
00:03:46,860 --> 00:03:51,640
And that's what it would look like to me if all I had was this truncated sentence.

62
00:03:51,640 --> 00:03:56,480
But when we look at the whole quote, and then the whole email, it turns out Thorne wasn't

63
00:03:56,480 --> 00:03:59,580
talking about the science of climate change at all.

64
00:03:59,580 --> 00:04:03,380
He was talking about a draft report to be published at a meeting.

65
00:04:03,380 --> 00:04:08,500
He's voicing his concern that the draft might be manipulated for political purposes.

66
00:04:08,500 --> 00:04:09,500
By whom?

67
00:04:09,500 --> 00:04:10,500
We don't know.

68
00:04:10,500 --> 00:04:13,500
And we don't even know if his fears were well-founded.

69
00:04:13,500 --> 00:04:17,380
But the very fact that he's voicing them, and that Phil Jones seems to agree that this

70
00:04:17,380 --> 00:04:23,780
shouldn't happen, is completely contrary to the picture we're being sold of a conspiracy.

71
00:04:23,780 --> 00:04:28,620
So if conspiracy theorists want to convince me these researchers are colluding to dishonestly

72
00:04:28,620 --> 00:04:34,460
fix the numbers, why do these email quotes show them arguing about the validity of data,

73
00:04:34,460 --> 00:04:38,460
or criticising a figure they think is deceptive?

74
00:04:38,460 --> 00:04:42,900
And what you don't see until you read the emails is that there are far more cases where

75
00:04:42,900 --> 00:04:47,340
they're critiquing the work of researchers who don't accept the role of CO2 in global

76
00:04:47,340 --> 00:04:48,380
warming.

77
00:04:48,380 --> 00:04:53,340
Why do we see private emails like this if these alleged conspirators know that their

78
00:04:53,340 --> 00:04:58,340
own conclusions are phony, and Christy and Douglas's conclusions are correct?

79
00:04:58,340 --> 00:05:04,300
It's the same question I had in 2009, when I showed this email, one of many examples

80
00:05:04,300 --> 00:05:08,620
of climate researchers arguing against hyping the science.

81
00:05:08,620 --> 00:05:12,220
And this email showed up again in this latest batch.

82
00:05:12,220 --> 00:05:15,940
Further evidence that a lot of them are simply the same emails.

83
00:05:15,940 --> 00:05:20,860
This is Tom Wigley, writing to a group of non-scientific academics who are soliciting

84
00:05:20,860 --> 00:05:25,500
signatures for a letter pushing for tougher controls on carbon emissions.

85
00:05:25,500 --> 00:05:29,780
Scientists have an added responsibility to keep their personal views separate from the

86
00:05:29,780 --> 00:05:34,660
science, he writes, and to make it clear to others when they diverge from the objectivity

87
00:05:34,660 --> 00:05:38,180
they hopefully adhere to in their scientific research.

88
00:05:38,180 --> 00:05:42,900
It isn't, of course, one of the emails being quoted in the blogosphere, because, like so

89
00:05:42,900 --> 00:05:48,100
many other emails, it doesn't fit the conspiracy theory.

90
00:05:48,100 --> 00:05:52,740
If conspiracy theorists are trying to convince me that there are examples of mistakes, bodges,

91
00:05:52,740 --> 00:05:56,100
and bias in climate science, OK, no problem.

92
00:05:56,100 --> 00:06:00,940
I was convinced of that long before this anti-science campaign began.

93
00:06:00,940 --> 00:06:07,100
Because there are always a few scientists guilty of these sins in any branch of science.

94
00:06:07,100 --> 00:06:09,500
But that isn't what we're being sold.

95
00:06:09,500 --> 00:06:15,020
This is supposed to be a worldwide conspiracy that's dreamed up an entire scientific theory

96
00:06:15,020 --> 00:06:17,660
of CO2 causing warming.

97
00:06:17,660 --> 00:06:21,920
I'm sure I'll get the usual comments from conspiracy theorists that I'm being entirely

98
00:06:21,920 --> 00:06:25,060
predictable by questioning these quotes.

99
00:06:25,060 --> 00:06:29,020
But of course, did you really think I'd just swallow them hook, line, and sinker without

100
00:06:29,020 --> 00:06:33,620
checking, like some dumb Daily Mail reader?

101
00:06:33,620 --> 00:06:37,860
This is why I see these quotes very differently to you.

102
00:06:37,860 --> 00:06:41,500
Conspiracy theorists will just look at the disembodied quotes and jump to the conclusion

103
00:06:41,500 --> 00:06:47,100
this confirms their conspiracy, while skeptics will take the time to check the context of

104
00:06:47,100 --> 00:06:52,080
the quotes and therefore end up with a much clearer picture of what they mean.

105
00:06:52,080 --> 00:06:57,020
All I can say to skeptics out there, and I mean people who really are sceptical, not

106
00:06:57,020 --> 00:07:00,940
those who simply swallow whatever they read on the internet without bothering to check

107
00:07:00,940 --> 00:07:01,940
it.

108
00:07:01,940 --> 00:07:06,580
If you want to find out what these disembodied quotes refer to, read the emails they came

109
00:07:06,580 --> 00:07:07,580
from.

110
00:07:07,580 --> 00:07:12,520
You'll read a surprisingly honest discussion, complete with arguments and certainties, as

111
00:07:12,520 --> 00:07:14,100
well as uncertainties.

112
00:07:14,100 --> 00:07:19,960
Yes, there are uncertainties in climate science, as there are in every field of science.

113
00:07:19,960 --> 00:07:24,620
But although conspiracy theorists get very excited when they see a doubt or an uncertainty

114
00:07:24,620 --> 00:07:30,360
expressed in the emails, and take this as a sign that these must be secret, no instance

115
00:07:30,360 --> 00:07:35,880
has been sighted of an uncertainty that hasn't already been openly discussed by these researchers

116
00:07:35,880 --> 00:07:39,080
in publicly available scientific journals.

117
00:07:39,080 --> 00:07:42,440
So conspiracy theorists, forgive me my scepticism.

118
00:07:42,440 --> 00:07:47,960
I know that in this fast food age of instant gratification, it's not fashionable to check

119
00:07:47,960 --> 00:07:51,900
everything and examine the evidence before rushing to judgement.

120
00:07:51,900 --> 00:07:54,080
But that's the way I work.

121
00:07:54,080 --> 00:07:58,560
I'd rather be the last person to get it right than the first person to get it wrong.
