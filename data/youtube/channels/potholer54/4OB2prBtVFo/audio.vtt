00:00.000 --> 00:10.780
Um, well, yeah, conspiracies exist, come on, say it with me, conspiracy, conspiracy.

00:10.780 --> 00:12.640
Conspiracy theorists, I have a complaint.

00:12.640 --> 00:13.640
You want a complaint?

00:13.640 --> 00:16.200
Look at these shoes, I've only had them three weeks, now it's in your pocket.

00:16.200 --> 00:17.200
Shut up.

00:17.200 --> 00:19.240
It's about this conspiracy you tried to sell me.

00:19.240 --> 00:23.680
I had a salesman show up at the door two years ago with what seemed like an incredible story

00:23.680 --> 00:29.800
of fabricated evidence and dishonest scientists, and at first I have to admit I was taken in.

00:29.800 --> 00:32.320
Especially by this.

00:32.320 --> 00:34.560
But then I did some checking.

00:34.560 --> 00:39.920
Now your salesman told me that hiding the decline referred to a decline in global temperatures,

00:39.920 --> 00:44.440
but when I read the actual email from which this quote was lifted, it turned out that

00:44.440 --> 00:50.320
he was talking about proxies, and a well-known phenomenon called the divergence problem.

00:50.320 --> 00:55.320
But a lot of people are so gullible they'll still believe anything your salesman say,

00:55.320 --> 00:59.600
and they were so convinced by this sales pitch two years ago they still cling to the belief

00:59.600 --> 01:04.320
that the decline refers to global temperatures.

01:04.320 --> 01:08.600
Now that bloody salesman is back again, peddling the same thing.

01:08.600 --> 01:12.940
Five thousand emails, which filled twenty-five thousand pages when I put them into plain

01:12.940 --> 01:16.400
text, of supposed fraud and conspiracy.

01:16.400 --> 01:20.880
Okay, I admit that at first I was sucked in, just like last time.

01:20.880 --> 01:25.200
I read a couple of emails which talked about destroying documents before any freedom of

01:25.200 --> 01:30.000
information request is received, and I thought, they're at it again.

01:30.000 --> 01:34.560
Ah, then I realised of course that these five thousand emails aren't new.

01:34.560 --> 01:37.920
They're part of the same batch that was leaked in 2009.

01:37.920 --> 01:41.680
Look, we already knew they were keeping their data secret.

01:41.680 --> 01:46.520
I and many others criticised them for it, and since then they've released all the data.

01:46.520 --> 01:49.400
So it's kind of old news.

01:49.400 --> 01:51.360
Some of the emails aren't even new.

01:51.360 --> 01:56.560
I thought I recognised this one, and yes, it's exactly the same email that was released

01:56.560 --> 01:59.260
with the first batch in 2009.

01:59.260 --> 02:01.380
By the way, I fell for this one too.

02:01.380 --> 02:05.080
It turns out the figure being discussed isn't man's.

02:05.080 --> 02:10.560
So not only are these emails contemporaneous, some of them, I have no idea how many, are

02:10.560 --> 02:12.520
identical.

02:12.520 --> 02:16.440
Now the problem I had with the salesman last time was that he was simply giving me quotes

02:16.440 --> 02:20.680
that looked sinister, but when you actually read them in the context of the emails they

02:20.680 --> 02:24.200
turned out to be just part of a debate about the science.

02:24.200 --> 02:27.800
So I thought at least this time your salesman would have a different approach.

02:27.800 --> 02:33.560
You know, show the whole email, explain what it's about and how it shows a conspiracy.

02:33.560 --> 02:36.360
Ah, but no.

02:36.360 --> 02:39.480
Here's a popular one, reprinted in the Daily Mail.

02:39.480 --> 02:44.560
The trick may be to decide on the main message and use that to guide what's included and

02:44.560 --> 02:45.920
what's left out.

02:45.920 --> 02:48.680
Ooh, sounds suspicious, right?

02:48.680 --> 02:52.360
But here's what Jonathan Overpeck said in context.

02:52.360 --> 02:57.040
He's talking about condensing a lot of information into a small amount of space.

02:57.040 --> 03:01.400
And that's why, he says, the trick may be to decide on the main message and use that

03:01.400 --> 03:04.400
to guide what's included and what's left out.

03:04.400 --> 03:09.680
For the IPCC, we need to know what is relevant and useful for assessing recent and future

03:09.680 --> 03:10.960
climate change.

03:10.960 --> 03:16.740
Moreover, we have to have solid data, not inconclusive information.

03:16.740 --> 03:19.840
So that paints a very different picture.

03:19.840 --> 03:24.820
This quote, which was widely circulated, is not only not a complete email, it's not even

03:24.820 --> 03:26.500
a complete sentence.

03:26.500 --> 03:28.420
The first part has been chopped off.

03:28.420 --> 03:32.860
Ironic that you're trying to sell me a story about deceptive science by showing me a quote

03:32.860 --> 03:35.520
that itself is deceptive.

03:35.520 --> 03:38.460
And here's the whole thing in context.

03:38.460 --> 03:43.700
Now a Financial Times columnist told us this email referred to the science of climate change

03:43.700 --> 03:46.860
being manipulated for political purposes.

03:46.860 --> 03:51.640
And that's what it would look like to me if all I had was this truncated sentence.

03:51.640 --> 03:56.480
But when we look at the whole quote, and then the whole email, it turns out Thorne wasn't

03:56.480 --> 03:59.580
talking about the science of climate change at all.

03:59.580 --> 04:03.380
He was talking about a draft report to be published at a meeting.

04:03.380 --> 04:08.500
He's voicing his concern that the draft might be manipulated for political purposes.

04:08.500 --> 04:09.500
By whom?

04:09.500 --> 04:10.500
We don't know.

04:10.500 --> 04:13.500
And we don't even know if his fears were well-founded.

04:13.500 --> 04:17.380
But the very fact that he's voicing them, and that Phil Jones seems to agree that this

04:17.380 --> 04:23.780
shouldn't happen, is completely contrary to the picture we're being sold of a conspiracy.

04:23.780 --> 04:28.620
So if conspiracy theorists want to convince me these researchers are colluding to dishonestly

04:28.620 --> 04:34.460
fix the numbers, why do these email quotes show them arguing about the validity of data,

04:34.460 --> 04:38.460
or criticising a figure they think is deceptive?

04:38.460 --> 04:42.900
And what you don't see until you read the emails is that there are far more cases where

04:42.900 --> 04:47.340
they're critiquing the work of researchers who don't accept the role of CO2 in global

04:47.340 --> 04:48.380
warming.

04:48.380 --> 04:53.340
Why do we see private emails like this if these alleged conspirators know that their

04:53.340 --> 04:58.340
own conclusions are phony, and Christy and Douglas's conclusions are correct?

04:58.340 --> 05:04.300
It's the same question I had in 2009, when I showed this email, one of many examples

05:04.300 --> 05:08.620
of climate researchers arguing against hyping the science.

05:08.620 --> 05:12.220
And this email showed up again in this latest batch.

05:12.220 --> 05:15.940
Further evidence that a lot of them are simply the same emails.

05:15.940 --> 05:20.860
This is Tom Wigley, writing to a group of non-scientific academics who are soliciting

05:20.860 --> 05:25.500
signatures for a letter pushing for tougher controls on carbon emissions.

05:25.500 --> 05:29.780
Scientists have an added responsibility to keep their personal views separate from the

05:29.780 --> 05:34.660
science, he writes, and to make it clear to others when they diverge from the objectivity

05:34.660 --> 05:38.180
they hopefully adhere to in their scientific research.

05:38.180 --> 05:42.900
It isn't, of course, one of the emails being quoted in the blogosphere, because, like so

05:42.900 --> 05:48.100
many other emails, it doesn't fit the conspiracy theory.

05:48.100 --> 05:52.740
If conspiracy theorists are trying to convince me that there are examples of mistakes, bodges,

05:52.740 --> 05:56.100
and bias in climate science, OK, no problem.

05:56.100 --> 06:00.940
I was convinced of that long before this anti-science campaign began.

06:00.940 --> 06:07.100
Because there are always a few scientists guilty of these sins in any branch of science.

06:07.100 --> 06:09.500
But that isn't what we're being sold.

06:09.500 --> 06:15.020
This is supposed to be a worldwide conspiracy that's dreamed up an entire scientific theory

06:15.020 --> 06:17.660
of CO2 causing warming.

06:17.660 --> 06:21.920
I'm sure I'll get the usual comments from conspiracy theorists that I'm being entirely

06:21.920 --> 06:25.060
predictable by questioning these quotes.

06:25.060 --> 06:29.020
But of course, did you really think I'd just swallow them hook, line, and sinker without

06:29.020 --> 06:33.620
checking, like some dumb Daily Mail reader?

06:33.620 --> 06:37.860
This is why I see these quotes very differently to you.

06:37.860 --> 06:41.500
Conspiracy theorists will just look at the disembodied quotes and jump to the conclusion

06:41.500 --> 06:47.100
this confirms their conspiracy, while skeptics will take the time to check the context of

06:47.100 --> 06:52.080
the quotes and therefore end up with a much clearer picture of what they mean.

06:52.080 --> 06:57.020
All I can say to skeptics out there, and I mean people who really are sceptical, not

06:57.020 --> 07:00.940
those who simply swallow whatever they read on the internet without bothering to check

07:00.940 --> 07:01.940
it.

07:01.940 --> 07:06.580
If you want to find out what these disembodied quotes refer to, read the emails they came

07:06.580 --> 07:07.580
from.

07:07.580 --> 07:12.520
You'll read a surprisingly honest discussion, complete with arguments and certainties, as

07:12.520 --> 07:14.100
well as uncertainties.

07:14.100 --> 07:19.960
Yes, there are uncertainties in climate science, as there are in every field of science.

07:19.960 --> 07:24.620
But although conspiracy theorists get very excited when they see a doubt or an uncertainty

07:24.620 --> 07:30.360
expressed in the emails, and take this as a sign that these must be secret, no instance

07:30.360 --> 07:35.880
has been sighted of an uncertainty that hasn't already been openly discussed by these researchers

07:35.880 --> 07:39.080
in publicly available scientific journals.

07:39.080 --> 07:42.440
So conspiracy theorists, forgive me my scepticism.

07:42.440 --> 07:47.960
I know that in this fast food age of instant gratification, it's not fashionable to check

07:47.960 --> 07:51.900
everything and examine the evidence before rushing to judgement.

07:51.900 --> 07:54.080
But that's the way I work.

07:54.080 --> 07:58.560
I'd rather be the last person to get it right than the first person to get it wrong.
