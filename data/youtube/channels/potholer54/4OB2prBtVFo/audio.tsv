0	10780	Um, well, yeah, conspiracies exist, come on, say it with me, conspiracy, conspiracy.
10780	12640	Conspiracy theorists, I have a complaint.
12640	13640	You want a complaint?
13640	16200	Look at these shoes, I've only had them three weeks, now it's in your pocket.
16200	17200	Shut up.
17200	19240	It's about this conspiracy you tried to sell me.
19240	23680	I had a salesman show up at the door two years ago with what seemed like an incredible story
23680	29800	of fabricated evidence and dishonest scientists, and at first I have to admit I was taken in.
29800	32320	Especially by this.
32320	34560	But then I did some checking.
34560	39920	Now your salesman told me that hiding the decline referred to a decline in global temperatures,
39920	44440	but when I read the actual email from which this quote was lifted, it turned out that
44440	50320	he was talking about proxies, and a well-known phenomenon called the divergence problem.
50320	55320	But a lot of people are so gullible they'll still believe anything your salesman say,
55320	59600	and they were so convinced by this sales pitch two years ago they still cling to the belief
59600	64320	that the decline refers to global temperatures.
64320	68600	Now that bloody salesman is back again, peddling the same thing.
68600	72940	Five thousand emails, which filled twenty-five thousand pages when I put them into plain
72940	76400	text, of supposed fraud and conspiracy.
76400	80880	Okay, I admit that at first I was sucked in, just like last time.
80880	85200	I read a couple of emails which talked about destroying documents before any freedom of
85200	90000	information request is received, and I thought, they're at it again.
90000	94560	Ah, then I realised of course that these five thousand emails aren't new.
94560	97920	They're part of the same batch that was leaked in 2009.
97920	101680	Look, we already knew they were keeping their data secret.
101680	106520	I and many others criticised them for it, and since then they've released all the data.
106520	109400	So it's kind of old news.
109400	111360	Some of the emails aren't even new.
111360	116560	I thought I recognised this one, and yes, it's exactly the same email that was released
116560	119260	with the first batch in 2009.
119260	121380	By the way, I fell for this one too.
121380	125080	It turns out the figure being discussed isn't man's.
125080	130560	So not only are these emails contemporaneous, some of them, I have no idea how many, are
130560	132520	identical.
132520	136440	Now the problem I had with the salesman last time was that he was simply giving me quotes
136440	140680	that looked sinister, but when you actually read them in the context of the emails they
140680	144200	turned out to be just part of a debate about the science.
144200	147800	So I thought at least this time your salesman would have a different approach.
147800	153560	You know, show the whole email, explain what it's about and how it shows a conspiracy.
153560	156360	Ah, but no.
156360	159480	Here's a popular one, reprinted in the Daily Mail.
159480	164560	The trick may be to decide on the main message and use that to guide what's included and
164560	165920	what's left out.
165920	168680	Ooh, sounds suspicious, right?
168680	172360	But here's what Jonathan Overpeck said in context.
172360	177040	He's talking about condensing a lot of information into a small amount of space.
177040	181400	And that's why, he says, the trick may be to decide on the main message and use that
181400	184400	to guide what's included and what's left out.
184400	189680	For the IPCC, we need to know what is relevant and useful for assessing recent and future
189680	190960	climate change.
190960	196740	Moreover, we have to have solid data, not inconclusive information.
196740	199840	So that paints a very different picture.
199840	204820	This quote, which was widely circulated, is not only not a complete email, it's not even
204820	206500	a complete sentence.
206500	208420	The first part has been chopped off.
208420	212860	Ironic that you're trying to sell me a story about deceptive science by showing me a quote
212860	215520	that itself is deceptive.
215520	218460	And here's the whole thing in context.
218460	223700	Now a Financial Times columnist told us this email referred to the science of climate change
223700	226860	being manipulated for political purposes.
226860	231640	And that's what it would look like to me if all I had was this truncated sentence.
231640	236480	But when we look at the whole quote, and then the whole email, it turns out Thorne wasn't
236480	239580	talking about the science of climate change at all.
239580	243380	He was talking about a draft report to be published at a meeting.
243380	248500	He's voicing his concern that the draft might be manipulated for political purposes.
248500	249500	By whom?
249500	250500	We don't know.
250500	253500	And we don't even know if his fears were well-founded.
253500	257380	But the very fact that he's voicing them, and that Phil Jones seems to agree that this
257380	263780	shouldn't happen, is completely contrary to the picture we're being sold of a conspiracy.
263780	268620	So if conspiracy theorists want to convince me these researchers are colluding to dishonestly
268620	274460	fix the numbers, why do these email quotes show them arguing about the validity of data,
274460	278460	or criticising a figure they think is deceptive?
278460	282900	And what you don't see until you read the emails is that there are far more cases where
282900	287340	they're critiquing the work of researchers who don't accept the role of CO2 in global
287340	288380	warming.
288380	293340	Why do we see private emails like this if these alleged conspirators know that their
293340	298340	own conclusions are phony, and Christy and Douglas's conclusions are correct?
298340	304300	It's the same question I had in 2009, when I showed this email, one of many examples
304300	308620	of climate researchers arguing against hyping the science.
308620	312220	And this email showed up again in this latest batch.
312220	315940	Further evidence that a lot of them are simply the same emails.
315940	320860	This is Tom Wigley, writing to a group of non-scientific academics who are soliciting
320860	325500	signatures for a letter pushing for tougher controls on carbon emissions.
325500	329780	Scientists have an added responsibility to keep their personal views separate from the
329780	334660	science, he writes, and to make it clear to others when they diverge from the objectivity
334660	338180	they hopefully adhere to in their scientific research.
338180	342900	It isn't, of course, one of the emails being quoted in the blogosphere, because, like so
342900	348100	many other emails, it doesn't fit the conspiracy theory.
348100	352740	If conspiracy theorists are trying to convince me that there are examples of mistakes, bodges,
352740	356100	and bias in climate science, OK, no problem.
356100	360940	I was convinced of that long before this anti-science campaign began.
360940	367100	Because there are always a few scientists guilty of these sins in any branch of science.
367100	369500	But that isn't what we're being sold.
369500	375020	This is supposed to be a worldwide conspiracy that's dreamed up an entire scientific theory
375020	377660	of CO2 causing warming.
377660	381920	I'm sure I'll get the usual comments from conspiracy theorists that I'm being entirely
381920	385060	predictable by questioning these quotes.
385060	389020	But of course, did you really think I'd just swallow them hook, line, and sinker without
389020	393620	checking, like some dumb Daily Mail reader?
393620	397860	This is why I see these quotes very differently to you.
397860	401500	Conspiracy theorists will just look at the disembodied quotes and jump to the conclusion
401500	407100	this confirms their conspiracy, while skeptics will take the time to check the context of
407100	412080	the quotes and therefore end up with a much clearer picture of what they mean.
412080	417020	All I can say to skeptics out there, and I mean people who really are sceptical, not
417020	420940	those who simply swallow whatever they read on the internet without bothering to check
420940	421940	it.
421940	426580	If you want to find out what these disembodied quotes refer to, read the emails they came
426580	427580	from.
427580	432520	You'll read a surprisingly honest discussion, complete with arguments and certainties, as
432520	434100	well as uncertainties.
434100	439960	Yes, there are uncertainties in climate science, as there are in every field of science.
439960	444620	But although conspiracy theorists get very excited when they see a doubt or an uncertainty
444620	450360	expressed in the emails, and take this as a sign that these must be secret, no instance
450360	455880	has been sighted of an uncertainty that hasn't already been openly discussed by these researchers
455880	459080	in publicly available scientific journals.
459080	462440	So conspiracy theorists, forgive me my scepticism.
462440	467960	I know that in this fast food age of instant gratification, it's not fashionable to check
467960	471900	everything and examine the evidence before rushing to judgement.
471900	474080	But that's the way I work.
474080	478560	I'd rather be the last person to get it right than the first person to get it wrong.
