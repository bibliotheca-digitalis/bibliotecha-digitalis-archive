1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:13,240
I usually wait until October to announce the winner of The Cock, the prize named after

2
00:00:13,240 --> 00:00:18,000
a YouTuber for the dumbest question asked in the expectation that there's no possible

3
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:19,000
answer.

4
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:23,120
But as the year wears on, I realise there's no way we'll be able to compete with this

5
00:00:23,120 --> 00:00:27,560
year's clear frontrunner, so I'm going to give the award, which is now bigger than

6
00:00:27,560 --> 00:00:30,400
ever a couple of months early.

7
00:00:30,400 --> 00:00:34,720
Before I introduce the winner, I first want to take you back to the very first Cock, which

8
00:00:34,720 --> 00:00:46,200
was awarded in 2008 to Stone Commander.

9
00:00:46,200 --> 00:00:50,880
The prize was then known as the Stone Commander Defiance and Ignorance Prize, but when Stone

10
00:00:50,880 --> 00:00:55,400
Commander turned out to be a very nice fellow who accepted that his question had been rather

11
00:00:55,400 --> 00:01:00,680
arrogantly put, I renamed the prize in honour of someone who truly fulfilled the perfect

12
00:01:00,680 --> 00:01:05,640
mix of arrogance and boneheadedness that the prize embodies.

13
00:01:05,640 --> 00:01:11,140
The reason I mention this is that in the 2008 video, I parodied Stone Commander's ignorance

14
00:01:11,140 --> 00:01:22,520
of the forces of nature with this.

15
00:01:22,520 --> 00:01:27,200
Now this was meant to be a parody, and I never dreamed there really was a creationist

16
00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:32,400
out there who didn't understand what drives the tides, let alone someone who's paid

17
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:35,960
to broadcast his ignorance to millions of people.

18
00:01:35,960 --> 00:01:43,080
But that was before this.

19
00:01:43,080 --> 00:01:46,080
Yes, David Silverman's face says it all.

20
00:01:46,080 --> 00:01:51,200
Did Bill O'Reilly really say, tide goes in, tide goes out, you just can't explain

21
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:52,200
that?

22
00:01:52,880 --> 00:02:07,000
Well, watch because he says it again.

23
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:11,360
To those who don't know him, Bill O'Reilly is a commentator on Fox News, although I'll

24
00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:16,080
always remember him as the anchorman for one of the worst tabloid shows on television,

25
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:17,080
Inside Edition.

26
00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:22,720
After he told the world no-one can explain what causes the tides to go in and out, O'Reilly

27
00:02:22,720 --> 00:02:28,000
was inundated with clarifications from people who went to school and understood the cause

28
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:29,000
perfectly well.

29
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:30,000
David, Beverly Hills, Florida.

30
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:34,080
What do you mean when you refer to the tides, when you asked about the existence of God?

31
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:37,460
Science explains the tides, the moon's gravity pulls on the ocean.

32
00:02:37,460 --> 00:02:41,800
But unlike Stone Commander, Bill wasn't the least bit humbled by the fact that he'd

33
00:02:41,800 --> 00:02:46,440
just been given an answer to a question he had told us was impossible to answer.

34
00:02:46,440 --> 00:02:51,360
He just moved on to the next thing he was ignorant of, that he was convinced would stump

35
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:52,360
us all.

36
00:02:52,360 --> 00:02:53,360
OK, how'd the moon get there?

37
00:02:53,360 --> 00:02:56,360
How'd the moon get there?

38
00:02:56,360 --> 00:03:00,640
Look, you pinheads who attacked me for this, you guys are just desperate.

39
00:03:00,640 --> 00:03:01,880
How'd the moon get there?

40
00:03:01,880 --> 00:03:02,880
How'd the sun get there?

41
00:03:02,880 --> 00:03:03,880
How'd it get there?

42
00:03:03,880 --> 00:03:05,880
Can you explain that to me?

43
00:03:05,880 --> 00:03:12,120
Well, yes we can, Bill, which I guess means that we were awake in school and the pinhead

44
00:03:12,120 --> 00:03:15,600
would be, well, you.

45
00:03:15,600 --> 00:03:19,300
Now I'm sure most people would laugh at your ignorance and give you a very condescending

46
00:03:19,300 --> 00:03:22,720
response that makes you look like a complete idiot.

47
00:03:22,720 --> 00:03:23,720
But not me.

48
00:03:23,720 --> 00:03:29,200
I'm not going to be condescending because this is a question I often get asked by children.

49
00:03:29,200 --> 00:03:33,080
So the principal of our local primary school has invited you to sit in on one of their

50
00:03:33,080 --> 00:03:37,840
science classes where you can learn about space along with the other kids.

51
00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:40,640
And at the end of it we're going to do a show and tell.

52
00:03:40,640 --> 00:03:43,960
All right, children, Mr O'Reilly will be joining us in class today.

53
00:03:44,320 --> 00:03:47,120
We're going to learn about the moon and stars.

54
00:03:47,120 --> 00:03:52,440
Okay, a lot of you probably think I am being condescending and you're right.

55
00:03:52,440 --> 00:03:56,440
This class is way past learning about the moon and stars, so I don't want to insult

56
00:03:56,440 --> 00:03:59,480
the intelligence of these kids by going through it all again.

57
00:03:59,480 --> 00:04:04,120
Sorry, Bill, I'm afraid we'll have to put you in a lower class.

58
00:04:04,120 --> 00:04:05,120
That's better.

59
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:07,440
Okay, let's start with the basics.

60
00:04:07,440 --> 00:04:08,680
Now pay attention, Bill.

61
00:04:08,680 --> 00:04:11,280
Where is space?

62
00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:12,280
Up there.

63
00:04:12,280 --> 00:04:13,280
Yeah.

64
00:04:14,280 --> 00:04:16,280
What's also up there?

65
00:04:16,280 --> 00:04:18,280
Stars and planets.

66
00:04:18,280 --> 00:04:20,280
That's right, Tommy.

67
00:04:20,280 --> 00:04:25,280
Now the planets all formed from dust that was drawn together by gravity, ironically

68
00:04:25,280 --> 00:04:28,280
the same thing that makes the tides go in and out.

69
00:04:28,280 --> 00:04:32,280
And they got bigger and bigger until they formed large planets that orbited the sun.

70
00:04:32,280 --> 00:04:36,280
Then two of these planets collided, forming the Earth.

71
00:04:36,280 --> 00:04:40,280
The collision threw up a lot of rock that circled the Earth and again was drawn together

72
00:04:40,280 --> 00:04:42,280
by gravity to form the moon.

73
00:04:42,280 --> 00:04:48,280
As for how the sun got there, it's explained in our class science book, Deep Deep Space.

74
00:04:48,280 --> 00:04:51,280
Now children, any more questions about the moon?

75
00:04:51,280 --> 00:04:53,280
Yes, Billy, again.

76
00:04:53,280 --> 00:04:56,280
How come we have that and Mars doesn't have it?

77
00:04:56,280 --> 00:04:59,280
Can anyone in the class answer that?

78
00:04:59,280 --> 00:05:02,280
Okay, I don't want to see the same hands up all the time.

79
00:05:02,280 --> 00:05:05,280
Come on, Billy, don't you have any idea?

80
00:05:05,280 --> 00:05:08,280
In the fact file it says Mars does have a moon.

81
00:05:08,280 --> 00:05:10,280
In fact it has two.

82
00:05:10,280 --> 00:05:13,280
Do you understand that a planet can have two moons, Billy?

83
00:05:13,280 --> 00:05:15,280
Well, sorry, but it does.

84
00:05:15,280 --> 00:05:17,280
Any other questions?

85
00:05:17,280 --> 00:05:18,280
Yes, Billy.

86
00:05:18,280 --> 00:05:20,280
How did that little amoeba get here?

87
00:05:20,280 --> 00:05:21,280
Call out there.

88
00:05:21,280 --> 00:05:22,280
How'd it do it?

89
00:05:22,280 --> 00:05:26,280
Maybe some of the older children can come into our class to explain it to me.

90
00:05:26,280 --> 00:05:30,280
Evolution is the way things change over time.

91
00:05:30,280 --> 00:05:33,280
Over a billion years or more.

92
00:05:33,280 --> 00:05:37,280
Well, without evolution no one would live on Earth.

93
00:05:37,280 --> 00:05:45,280
It's nature and they like discovering nature and seeing how its body works and stuff.

94
00:05:45,280 --> 00:05:46,280
Time comes in, time goes out.

95
00:05:46,280 --> 00:05:48,280
Billy, I've just explained that.

96
00:05:48,280 --> 00:05:49,280
Time comes in, time goes out.

97
00:05:49,280 --> 00:05:50,280
It's the moon, Billy.

98
00:05:50,280 --> 00:05:51,280
Okay, yeah, the moon does it, fine.

99
00:05:51,280 --> 00:05:53,280
How'd the moon get there?

100
00:05:53,280 --> 00:05:54,280
Who put it there?

101
00:05:54,280 --> 00:05:57,280
No one put the moon there, now you're just being silly, Billy.

102
00:05:57,280 --> 00:06:00,280
You're going to have to explain this for our show and tell, so stop being silly.

103
00:06:00,280 --> 00:06:05,280
Okay, if we have existence, if we have life on Earth, how come they don't have it on the other planets?

104
00:06:05,280 --> 00:06:07,280
We don't know that they don't, Billy.

105
00:06:07,280 --> 00:06:10,280
Have you been to Uranus and checked there's no life there?

106
00:06:10,280 --> 00:06:12,280
Now you're just showing off.

107
00:06:12,280 --> 00:06:17,280
Still, at least you do understand that the gravitational attraction of the moon causes the tides,

108
00:06:17,280 --> 00:06:21,280
so you earn a smiley face sticker and you can choose a toy from the toy tray.

109
00:06:21,280 --> 00:06:27,280
Okay, Billy, now it's time to get behind the teacher's desk so you can practice your lines for show and tell.

110
00:06:27,280 --> 00:06:28,280
I've written it out for you.

111
00:06:28,280 --> 00:06:30,280
Can you read what's on the card?

112
00:06:35,280 --> 00:06:38,280
Now, I can't read it, there's no words on it.

113
00:06:38,280 --> 00:06:39,280
Don't be silly, Billy.

114
00:06:39,280 --> 00:06:41,280
The moon was formed...

115
00:06:41,280 --> 00:06:42,280
Now what does that mean?

116
00:06:42,280 --> 00:06:43,280
Billy?

117
00:06:43,280 --> 00:06:44,280
The moon was fo...

118
00:06:44,280 --> 00:06:45,280
Hey, fuck it!

119
00:06:45,280 --> 00:06:46,280
Billy!

120
00:06:47,280 --> 00:06:48,280
Fuck it!

121
00:06:48,280 --> 00:06:50,280
I'll take away your smiley face sticker.

122
00:06:50,280 --> 00:06:52,280
Fucking thing sucks!

123
00:06:52,280 --> 00:06:55,280
Okay, Billy's thrown a hissy fit and stormed out of class,

124
00:06:55,280 --> 00:07:00,280
but at least I tried to educate him with kids of his level instead of being condescending.

125
00:07:01,280 --> 00:07:04,280
The difference between Bill O'Reilly and five-year-old kids

126
00:07:04,280 --> 00:07:07,280
is that at least they're willing to listen and to learn.

127
00:07:07,280 --> 00:07:10,280
Listen to me because you'll learn.

128
00:07:12,280 --> 00:07:15,280
So when kids ask a basic question like where the moon came from,

129
00:07:15,280 --> 00:07:18,280
they actually want to know the answer.

130
00:07:18,280 --> 00:07:22,280
If it doesn't make sense to them, they'll question it or argue against it,

131
00:07:22,280 --> 00:07:26,280
but that's good, it shows intelligence and critical thinking.

132
00:07:26,280 --> 00:07:28,280
When Bill O'Reilly asks where the moon came from,

133
00:07:28,280 --> 00:07:33,280
it's in the confident expectation that there's no possible natural explanation,

134
00:07:33,280 --> 00:07:36,280
and it's for asking a dumb question in the confident expectation

135
00:07:36,280 --> 00:07:40,280
there's no possible answer that Bill O'Reilly is in a league of his own

136
00:07:40,280 --> 00:07:44,280
to receive this year's large and glittering cock.
