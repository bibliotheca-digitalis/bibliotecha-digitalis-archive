0	13240	I usually wait until October to announce the winner of The Cock, the prize named after
13240	18000	a YouTuber for the dumbest question asked in the expectation that there's no possible
18000	19000	answer.
19000	23120	But as the year wears on, I realise there's no way we'll be able to compete with this
23120	27560	year's clear frontrunner, so I'm going to give the award, which is now bigger than
27560	30400	ever a couple of months early.
30400	34720	Before I introduce the winner, I first want to take you back to the very first Cock, which
34720	46200	was awarded in 2008 to Stone Commander.
46200	50880	The prize was then known as the Stone Commander Defiance and Ignorance Prize, but when Stone
50880	55400	Commander turned out to be a very nice fellow who accepted that his question had been rather
55400	60680	arrogantly put, I renamed the prize in honour of someone who truly fulfilled the perfect
60680	65640	mix of arrogance and boneheadedness that the prize embodies.
65640	71140	The reason I mention this is that in the 2008 video, I parodied Stone Commander's ignorance
71140	82520	of the forces of nature with this.
82520	87200	Now this was meant to be a parody, and I never dreamed there really was a creationist
87200	92400	out there who didn't understand what drives the tides, let alone someone who's paid
92400	95960	to broadcast his ignorance to millions of people.
95960	103080	But that was before this.
103080	106080	Yes, David Silverman's face says it all.
106080	111200	Did Bill O'Reilly really say, tide goes in, tide goes out, you just can't explain
111200	112200	that?
112880	127000	Well, watch because he says it again.
127000	131360	To those who don't know him, Bill O'Reilly is a commentator on Fox News, although I'll
131360	136080	always remember him as the anchorman for one of the worst tabloid shows on television,
136080	137080	Inside Edition.
137680	142720	After he told the world no-one can explain what causes the tides to go in and out, O'Reilly
142720	148000	was inundated with clarifications from people who went to school and understood the cause
148000	149000	perfectly well.
149000	150000	David, Beverly Hills, Florida.
150000	154080	What do you mean when you refer to the tides, when you asked about the existence of God?
154080	157460	Science explains the tides, the moon's gravity pulls on the ocean.
157460	161800	But unlike Stone Commander, Bill wasn't the least bit humbled by the fact that he'd
161800	166440	just been given an answer to a question he had told us was impossible to answer.
166440	171360	He just moved on to the next thing he was ignorant of, that he was convinced would stump
171360	172360	us all.
172360	173360	OK, how'd the moon get there?
173360	176360	How'd the moon get there?
176360	180640	Look, you pinheads who attacked me for this, you guys are just desperate.
180640	181880	How'd the moon get there?
181880	182880	How'd the sun get there?
182880	183880	How'd it get there?
183880	185880	Can you explain that to me?
185880	192120	Well, yes we can, Bill, which I guess means that we were awake in school and the pinhead
192120	195600	would be, well, you.
195600	199300	Now I'm sure most people would laugh at your ignorance and give you a very condescending
199300	202720	response that makes you look like a complete idiot.
202720	203720	But not me.
203720	209200	I'm not going to be condescending because this is a question I often get asked by children.
209200	213080	So the principal of our local primary school has invited you to sit in on one of their
213080	217840	science classes where you can learn about space along with the other kids.
217840	220640	And at the end of it we're going to do a show and tell.
220640	223960	All right, children, Mr O'Reilly will be joining us in class today.
224320	227120	We're going to learn about the moon and stars.
227120	232440	Okay, a lot of you probably think I am being condescending and you're right.
232440	236440	This class is way past learning about the moon and stars, so I don't want to insult
236440	239480	the intelligence of these kids by going through it all again.
239480	244120	Sorry, Bill, I'm afraid we'll have to put you in a lower class.
244120	245120	That's better.
245120	247440	Okay, let's start with the basics.
247440	248680	Now pay attention, Bill.
248680	251280	Where is space?
251280	252280	Up there.
252280	253280	Yeah.
254280	256280	What's also up there?
256280	258280	Stars and planets.
258280	260280	That's right, Tommy.
260280	265280	Now the planets all formed from dust that was drawn together by gravity, ironically
265280	268280	the same thing that makes the tides go in and out.
268280	272280	And they got bigger and bigger until they formed large planets that orbited the sun.
272280	276280	Then two of these planets collided, forming the Earth.
276280	280280	The collision threw up a lot of rock that circled the Earth and again was drawn together
280280	282280	by gravity to form the moon.
282280	288280	As for how the sun got there, it's explained in our class science book, Deep Deep Space.
288280	291280	Now children, any more questions about the moon?
291280	293280	Yes, Billy, again.
293280	296280	How come we have that and Mars doesn't have it?
296280	299280	Can anyone in the class answer that?
299280	302280	Okay, I don't want to see the same hands up all the time.
302280	305280	Come on, Billy, don't you have any idea?
305280	308280	In the fact file it says Mars does have a moon.
308280	310280	In fact it has two.
310280	313280	Do you understand that a planet can have two moons, Billy?
313280	315280	Well, sorry, but it does.
315280	317280	Any other questions?
317280	318280	Yes, Billy.
318280	320280	How did that little amoeba get here?
320280	321280	Call out there.
321280	322280	How'd it do it?
322280	326280	Maybe some of the older children can come into our class to explain it to me.
326280	330280	Evolution is the way things change over time.
330280	333280	Over a billion years or more.
333280	337280	Well, without evolution no one would live on Earth.
337280	345280	It's nature and they like discovering nature and seeing how its body works and stuff.
345280	346280	Time comes in, time goes out.
346280	348280	Billy, I've just explained that.
348280	349280	Time comes in, time goes out.
349280	350280	It's the moon, Billy.
350280	351280	Okay, yeah, the moon does it, fine.
351280	353280	How'd the moon get there?
353280	354280	Who put it there?
354280	357280	No one put the moon there, now you're just being silly, Billy.
357280	360280	You're going to have to explain this for our show and tell, so stop being silly.
360280	365280	Okay, if we have existence, if we have life on Earth, how come they don't have it on the other planets?
365280	367280	We don't know that they don't, Billy.
367280	370280	Have you been to Uranus and checked there's no life there?
370280	372280	Now you're just showing off.
372280	377280	Still, at least you do understand that the gravitational attraction of the moon causes the tides,
377280	381280	so you earn a smiley face sticker and you can choose a toy from the toy tray.
381280	387280	Okay, Billy, now it's time to get behind the teacher's desk so you can practice your lines for show and tell.
387280	388280	I've written it out for you.
388280	390280	Can you read what's on the card?
395280	398280	Now, I can't read it, there's no words on it.
398280	399280	Don't be silly, Billy.
399280	401280	The moon was formed...
401280	402280	Now what does that mean?
402280	403280	Billy?
403280	404280	The moon was fo...
404280	405280	Hey, fuck it!
405280	406280	Billy!
407280	408280	Fuck it!
408280	410280	I'll take away your smiley face sticker.
410280	412280	Fucking thing sucks!
412280	415280	Okay, Billy's thrown a hissy fit and stormed out of class,
415280	420280	but at least I tried to educate him with kids of his level instead of being condescending.
421280	424280	The difference between Bill O'Reilly and five-year-old kids
424280	427280	is that at least they're willing to listen and to learn.
427280	430280	Listen to me because you'll learn.
432280	435280	So when kids ask a basic question like where the moon came from,
435280	438280	they actually want to know the answer.
438280	442280	If it doesn't make sense to them, they'll question it or argue against it,
442280	446280	but that's good, it shows intelligence and critical thinking.
446280	448280	When Bill O'Reilly asks where the moon came from,
448280	453280	it's in the confident expectation that there's no possible natural explanation,
453280	456280	and it's for asking a dumb question in the confident expectation
456280	460280	there's no possible answer that Bill O'Reilly is in a league of his own
460280	464280	to receive this year's large and glittering cock.
