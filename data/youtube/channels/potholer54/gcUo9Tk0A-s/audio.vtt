WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:13.240
I usually wait until October to announce the winner of The Cock, the prize named after

00:13.240 --> 00:18.000
a YouTuber for the dumbest question asked in the expectation that there's no possible

00:18.000 --> 00:19.000
answer.

00:19.000 --> 00:23.120
But as the year wears on, I realise there's no way we'll be able to compete with this

00:23.120 --> 00:27.560
year's clear frontrunner, so I'm going to give the award, which is now bigger than

00:27.560 --> 00:30.400
ever a couple of months early.

00:30.400 --> 00:34.720
Before I introduce the winner, I first want to take you back to the very first Cock, which

00:34.720 --> 00:46.200
was awarded in 2008 to Stone Commander.

00:46.200 --> 00:50.880
The prize was then known as the Stone Commander Defiance and Ignorance Prize, but when Stone

00:50.880 --> 00:55.400
Commander turned out to be a very nice fellow who accepted that his question had been rather

00:55.400 --> 01:00.680
arrogantly put, I renamed the prize in honour of someone who truly fulfilled the perfect

01:00.680 --> 01:05.640
mix of arrogance and boneheadedness that the prize embodies.

01:05.640 --> 01:11.140
The reason I mention this is that in the 2008 video, I parodied Stone Commander's ignorance

01:11.140 --> 01:22.520
of the forces of nature with this.

01:22.520 --> 01:27.200
Now this was meant to be a parody, and I never dreamed there really was a creationist

01:27.200 --> 01:32.400
out there who didn't understand what drives the tides, let alone someone who's paid

01:32.400 --> 01:35.960
to broadcast his ignorance to millions of people.

01:35.960 --> 01:43.080
But that was before this.

01:43.080 --> 01:46.080
Yes, David Silverman's face says it all.

01:46.080 --> 01:51.200
Did Bill O'Reilly really say, tide goes in, tide goes out, you just can't explain

01:51.200 --> 01:52.200
that?

01:52.880 --> 02:07.000
Well, watch because he says it again.

02:07.000 --> 02:11.360
To those who don't know him, Bill O'Reilly is a commentator on Fox News, although I'll

02:11.360 --> 02:16.080
always remember him as the anchorman for one of the worst tabloid shows on television,

02:16.080 --> 02:17.080
Inside Edition.

02:17.680 --> 02:22.720
After he told the world no-one can explain what causes the tides to go in and out, O'Reilly

02:22.720 --> 02:28.000
was inundated with clarifications from people who went to school and understood the cause

02:28.000 --> 02:29.000
perfectly well.

02:29.000 --> 02:30.000
David, Beverly Hills, Florida.

02:30.000 --> 02:34.080
What do you mean when you refer to the tides, when you asked about the existence of God?

02:34.080 --> 02:37.460
Science explains the tides, the moon's gravity pulls on the ocean.

02:37.460 --> 02:41.800
But unlike Stone Commander, Bill wasn't the least bit humbled by the fact that he'd

02:41.800 --> 02:46.440
just been given an answer to a question he had told us was impossible to answer.

02:46.440 --> 02:51.360
He just moved on to the next thing he was ignorant of, that he was convinced would stump

02:51.360 --> 02:52.360
us all.

02:52.360 --> 02:53.360
OK, how'd the moon get there?

02:53.360 --> 02:56.360
How'd the moon get there?

02:56.360 --> 03:00.640
Look, you pinheads who attacked me for this, you guys are just desperate.

03:00.640 --> 03:01.880
How'd the moon get there?

03:01.880 --> 03:02.880
How'd the sun get there?

03:02.880 --> 03:03.880
How'd it get there?

03:03.880 --> 03:05.880
Can you explain that to me?

03:05.880 --> 03:12.120
Well, yes we can, Bill, which I guess means that we were awake in school and the pinhead

03:12.120 --> 03:15.600
would be, well, you.

03:15.600 --> 03:19.300
Now I'm sure most people would laugh at your ignorance and give you a very condescending

03:19.300 --> 03:22.720
response that makes you look like a complete idiot.

03:22.720 --> 03:23.720
But not me.

03:23.720 --> 03:29.200
I'm not going to be condescending because this is a question I often get asked by children.

03:29.200 --> 03:33.080
So the principal of our local primary school has invited you to sit in on one of their

03:33.080 --> 03:37.840
science classes where you can learn about space along with the other kids.

03:37.840 --> 03:40.640
And at the end of it we're going to do a show and tell.

03:40.640 --> 03:43.960
All right, children, Mr O'Reilly will be joining us in class today.

03:44.320 --> 03:47.120
We're going to learn about the moon and stars.

03:47.120 --> 03:52.440
Okay, a lot of you probably think I am being condescending and you're right.

03:52.440 --> 03:56.440
This class is way past learning about the moon and stars, so I don't want to insult

03:56.440 --> 03:59.480
the intelligence of these kids by going through it all again.

03:59.480 --> 04:04.120
Sorry, Bill, I'm afraid we'll have to put you in a lower class.

04:04.120 --> 04:05.120
That's better.

04:05.120 --> 04:07.440
Okay, let's start with the basics.

04:07.440 --> 04:08.680
Now pay attention, Bill.

04:08.680 --> 04:11.280
Where is space?

04:11.280 --> 04:12.280
Up there.

04:12.280 --> 04:13.280
Yeah.

04:14.280 --> 04:16.280
What's also up there?

04:16.280 --> 04:18.280
Stars and planets.

04:18.280 --> 04:20.280
That's right, Tommy.

04:20.280 --> 04:25.280
Now the planets all formed from dust that was drawn together by gravity, ironically

04:25.280 --> 04:28.280
the same thing that makes the tides go in and out.

04:28.280 --> 04:32.280
And they got bigger and bigger until they formed large planets that orbited the sun.

04:32.280 --> 04:36.280
Then two of these planets collided, forming the Earth.

04:36.280 --> 04:40.280
The collision threw up a lot of rock that circled the Earth and again was drawn together

04:40.280 --> 04:42.280
by gravity to form the moon.

04:42.280 --> 04:48.280
As for how the sun got there, it's explained in our class science book, Deep Deep Space.

04:48.280 --> 04:51.280
Now children, any more questions about the moon?

04:51.280 --> 04:53.280
Yes, Billy, again.

04:53.280 --> 04:56.280
How come we have that and Mars doesn't have it?

04:56.280 --> 04:59.280
Can anyone in the class answer that?

04:59.280 --> 05:02.280
Okay, I don't want to see the same hands up all the time.

05:02.280 --> 05:05.280
Come on, Billy, don't you have any idea?

05:05.280 --> 05:08.280
In the fact file it says Mars does have a moon.

05:08.280 --> 05:10.280
In fact it has two.

05:10.280 --> 05:13.280
Do you understand that a planet can have two moons, Billy?

05:13.280 --> 05:15.280
Well, sorry, but it does.

05:15.280 --> 05:17.280
Any other questions?

05:17.280 --> 05:18.280
Yes, Billy.

05:18.280 --> 05:20.280
How did that little amoeba get here?

05:20.280 --> 05:21.280
Call out there.

05:21.280 --> 05:22.280
How'd it do it?

05:22.280 --> 05:26.280
Maybe some of the older children can come into our class to explain it to me.

05:26.280 --> 05:30.280
Evolution is the way things change over time.

05:30.280 --> 05:33.280
Over a billion years or more.

05:33.280 --> 05:37.280
Well, without evolution no one would live on Earth.

05:37.280 --> 05:45.280
It's nature and they like discovering nature and seeing how its body works and stuff.

05:45.280 --> 05:46.280
Time comes in, time goes out.

05:46.280 --> 05:48.280
Billy, I've just explained that.

05:48.280 --> 05:49.280
Time comes in, time goes out.

05:49.280 --> 05:50.280
It's the moon, Billy.

05:50.280 --> 05:51.280
Okay, yeah, the moon does it, fine.

05:51.280 --> 05:53.280
How'd the moon get there?

05:53.280 --> 05:54.280
Who put it there?

05:54.280 --> 05:57.280
No one put the moon there, now you're just being silly, Billy.

05:57.280 --> 06:00.280
You're going to have to explain this for our show and tell, so stop being silly.

06:00.280 --> 06:05.280
Okay, if we have existence, if we have life on Earth, how come they don't have it on the other planets?

06:05.280 --> 06:07.280
We don't know that they don't, Billy.

06:07.280 --> 06:10.280
Have you been to Uranus and checked there's no life there?

06:10.280 --> 06:12.280
Now you're just showing off.

06:12.280 --> 06:17.280
Still, at least you do understand that the gravitational attraction of the moon causes the tides,

06:17.280 --> 06:21.280
so you earn a smiley face sticker and you can choose a toy from the toy tray.

06:21.280 --> 06:27.280
Okay, Billy, now it's time to get behind the teacher's desk so you can practice your lines for show and tell.

06:27.280 --> 06:28.280
I've written it out for you.

06:28.280 --> 06:30.280
Can you read what's on the card?

06:35.280 --> 06:38.280
Now, I can't read it, there's no words on it.

06:38.280 --> 06:39.280
Don't be silly, Billy.

06:39.280 --> 06:41.280
The moon was formed...

06:41.280 --> 06:42.280
Now what does that mean?

06:42.280 --> 06:43.280
Billy?

06:43.280 --> 06:44.280
The moon was fo...

06:44.280 --> 06:45.280
Hey, fuck it!

06:45.280 --> 06:46.280
Billy!

06:47.280 --> 06:48.280
Fuck it!

06:48.280 --> 06:50.280
I'll take away your smiley face sticker.

06:50.280 --> 06:52.280
Fucking thing sucks!

06:52.280 --> 06:55.280
Okay, Billy's thrown a hissy fit and stormed out of class,

06:55.280 --> 07:00.280
but at least I tried to educate him with kids of his level instead of being condescending.

07:01.280 --> 07:04.280
The difference between Bill O'Reilly and five-year-old kids

07:04.280 --> 07:07.280
is that at least they're willing to listen and to learn.

07:07.280 --> 07:10.280
Listen to me because you'll learn.

07:12.280 --> 07:15.280
So when kids ask a basic question like where the moon came from,

07:15.280 --> 07:18.280
they actually want to know the answer.

07:18.280 --> 07:22.280
If it doesn't make sense to them, they'll question it or argue against it,

07:22.280 --> 07:26.280
but that's good, it shows intelligence and critical thinking.

07:26.280 --> 07:28.280
When Bill O'Reilly asks where the moon came from,

07:28.280 --> 07:33.280
it's in the confident expectation that there's no possible natural explanation,

07:33.280 --> 07:36.280
and it's for asking a dumb question in the confident expectation

07:36.280 --> 07:40.280
there's no possible answer that Bill O'Reilly is in a league of his own

07:40.280 --> 07:44.280
to receive this year's large and glittering cock.
