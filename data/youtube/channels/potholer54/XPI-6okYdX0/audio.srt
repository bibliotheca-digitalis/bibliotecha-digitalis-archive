1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,060
Great, steaming lumps of Thirk!

2
00:00:03,060 --> 00:00:05,560
Kent Hovind's busted out of jail.

3
00:00:05,560 --> 00:00:09,520
And what a wonderful gift the Lugemeister gave me on his release.

4
00:00:09,520 --> 00:00:14,100
In his very first video, he starts off talking about something that was going to be the subject

5
00:00:14,100 --> 00:00:16,760
of my next video, this video.

6
00:00:16,760 --> 00:00:20,080
But if you add up the dates given in the Bible, you'll find what everybody else has found

7
00:00:20,080 --> 00:00:21,680
through history that's done this.

8
00:00:21,680 --> 00:00:26,520
The Bible dates indicate the Earth was created in six days about 6,000 years ago.

9
00:00:26,520 --> 00:00:29,820
It is not millions or billions of years old.

10
00:00:29,820 --> 00:00:32,660
So this top timeline kind of indicates what the Bible teaches.

11
00:00:32,660 --> 00:00:37,140
6,000 years ago, or 4,000 BC, God created everything.

12
00:00:37,140 --> 00:00:42,140
4,400 years ago, there was a big flood in the days of Noah that destroyed everything.

13
00:00:42,140 --> 00:00:47,360
And that flood explains all the geology of the world, the canyons, the mountain ranges,

14
00:00:47,360 --> 00:00:49,700
the ocean basins, the continental shelf.

15
00:00:49,700 --> 00:00:54,140
And we cover all that on video number five or six of our series, which you can see right

16
00:00:54,140 --> 00:00:56,140
here on the YouTube channel.

17
00:00:56,140 --> 00:01:00,740
When Jesus came 2,000 years ago, and here we are today, 2015, today happens to be July

18
00:01:00,740 --> 00:01:06,740
20th, and the Lord's coming back probably, hopefully, soon, next to 10, 15 years, we'll

19
00:01:06,740 --> 00:01:07,740
see about that.

20
00:01:07,740 --> 00:01:12,620
Yeah, that's kind of what fundamentalists have been saying for the last 2,000 years.

21
00:01:12,620 --> 00:01:16,900
But credit where credit's due, Kent Hovind's absolutely right.

22
00:01:16,900 --> 00:01:21,060
Seriously, if you add up the dates in the Bible, they produce an age for the universe

23
00:01:21,060 --> 00:01:24,260
and the Earth of just 6,000 years.

24
00:01:24,300 --> 00:01:29,820
That's why we know the Bible's full of crap, at least when it comes to scientific details.

25
00:01:29,820 --> 00:01:35,060
Because we've already seen in previous videos how four billion years of geological history

26
00:01:35,060 --> 00:01:40,020
doesn't fit into just 6,000 years, and how three and a half billion years of evolutionary

27
00:01:40,020 --> 00:01:43,940
history doesn't fit into just 4,500 years.

28
00:01:43,940 --> 00:01:48,820
And in this video, we're going to see how over 5,000 years of Egyptian history can't

29
00:01:48,820 --> 00:01:51,540
squeeze into 3,000 years.

30
00:01:51,540 --> 00:01:55,740
And unusually for this channel, we're not going to do it with historical, archaeological

31
00:01:55,740 --> 00:01:57,820
or scientific evidence.

32
00:01:57,820 --> 00:01:59,300
That would be too easy.

33
00:01:59,300 --> 00:02:03,060
I'm going to let creationists argue with themselves.

34
00:02:03,060 --> 00:02:08,100
For example, the fundamentalist encyclopedia, Conservopedia, tells us the chronology of

35
00:02:08,100 --> 00:02:14,420
ancient Egypt, the idea that Egyptian civilisation is 5,000 years old, is the least settled of

36
00:02:14,420 --> 00:02:17,780
all the chronologies of the great powers of the ancient Near East.

37
00:02:17,780 --> 00:02:19,380
Highly dubious at best.

38
00:02:19,380 --> 00:02:23,060
Moreover, an increasing body of evidence now suggests that the history of ancient Egypt

39
00:02:23,060 --> 00:02:27,980
is shorter, by several millennia, than most scholars have previously supposed.

40
00:02:27,980 --> 00:02:33,060
More recent research now strongly supports the original conclusion of James Usher.

41
00:02:33,060 --> 00:02:38,140
In other words, it supports Usher's conclusion that the world is just 6,000 years old, and

42
00:02:38,140 --> 00:02:43,700
that Egyptian civilisation arose after the Biblical flood 4,500 years ago.

43
00:02:43,700 --> 00:02:45,660
What research supports this?

44
00:02:45,660 --> 00:02:48,660
Maybe a paper in the Journal of Archaeological Research?

45
00:02:48,660 --> 00:02:49,940
Or Egyptian Archaeology?

46
00:02:49,940 --> 00:02:52,380
Or the International Journal of Historical Archaeology?

47
00:02:52,380 --> 00:02:53,540
Or World Archaeology?

48
00:02:53,540 --> 00:02:55,260
Or the Journal of Egyptian Archaeology?

49
00:02:55,260 --> 00:02:57,300
Or the Journal of Anthropology and Archaeology?

50
00:02:57,300 --> 00:02:59,300
I can't wait to find out.

51
00:02:59,300 --> 00:03:05,300
Well if we click on the reference link, we find it's a website run by Creationist Ministries

52
00:03:05,300 --> 00:03:07,180
International.

53
00:03:07,180 --> 00:03:11,980
This is Conservopedia's source that an increasing body of evidence now suggests that the history

54
00:03:11,980 --> 00:03:17,340
of ancient Egypt is shorter, by several millennia, than most scholars previously supposed.

55
00:03:17,340 --> 00:03:22,460
And it's based, as you can see, on Biblical stories and what Creationist Ministry International

56
00:03:22,460 --> 00:03:25,380
calls the truth and authority of the Bible.

57
00:03:25,380 --> 00:03:30,460
Meanwhile, most scholars and most encyclopedias still go with the wealth of archaeological

58
00:03:30,460 --> 00:03:33,740
evidence, like this one.

59
00:03:33,740 --> 00:03:38,660
Egypt has endured as a unified state for more than 5,000 years, it says, and archaeological

60
00:03:38,660 --> 00:03:43,900
evidence indicates that a developed Egyptian society has existed for much longer.

61
00:03:43,900 --> 00:03:47,320
And another entry in the same encyclopaedia concurs.

62
00:03:47,320 --> 00:03:49,900
So which encyclopaedia is it?

63
00:03:49,900 --> 00:03:50,900
Wait what?

64
00:03:50,900 --> 00:03:52,380
Great knobbly plates of toast!

65
00:03:52,380 --> 00:03:57,380
It's Conservopedia, the same encyclopaedia that told us this great age was dubious at

66
00:03:57,380 --> 00:04:01,100
best and contradicted by more recent research.

67
00:04:01,100 --> 00:04:06,860
And if we click on the link to Egyptian Chronology, we come to, yes, that very page.

68
00:04:06,860 --> 00:04:12,140
So on the one hand, Conservopedia is telling us Egyptian civilisation is 5,000 years old,

69
00:04:12,140 --> 00:04:16,420
and on the other hand Conservopedia is telling us this is nonsense.

70
00:04:16,420 --> 00:04:20,780
That's what you get when you try to squeeze things into timescales that don't fit.

71
00:04:20,780 --> 00:04:23,980
You end up with your foot inside your own mouth.

72
00:04:23,980 --> 00:04:27,840
But again, I'm not going to argue with these creationists, I'll let them carry on arguing

73
00:04:27,840 --> 00:04:29,260
with themselves.

74
00:04:29,260 --> 00:04:36,500
According to answers in Genesis, the Biblical flood dates to 2,348 BC, and 160 years after

75
00:04:36,500 --> 00:04:41,940
the flood had subsided, according to answers in Genesis, a grandson of Noah, Mizraim, took

76
00:04:41,940 --> 00:04:47,140
his family to settle in Egypt in 2,188 BC.

77
00:04:47,140 --> 00:04:50,500
So when did his descendants build the first large pyramid?

78
00:04:50,500 --> 00:04:56,500
No, not that pyramid, this is the first large pyramid, called the step pyramid.

79
00:04:56,500 --> 00:05:02,320
Answers in Genesis tells us it was built between 2100 to 2000 BC.

80
00:05:02,320 --> 00:05:07,240
Although the pyramid builders would have started work on it just 88 years after AIG

81
00:05:07,240 --> 00:05:11,240
tells us the first family of humans arrived to settle Egypt.

82
00:05:11,240 --> 00:05:14,040
So how many people were around to do this?

83
00:05:14,040 --> 00:05:20,180
AIG claims that since the flood, the human population has doubled every 150 years.

84
00:05:20,180 --> 00:05:24,920
And if you double the population every 150 years, you conveniently go from 8 people on

85
00:05:24,920 --> 00:05:28,320
the ark to around 7 billion people on Earth today.

86
00:05:28,320 --> 00:05:34,080
AIG calls this estimate very conservative by comparing it with population growth in

87
00:05:34,080 --> 00:05:35,720
the modern era.

88
00:05:35,720 --> 00:05:40,760
But of course in the modern era we have medicine, inoculation against disease, sanitation, welfare,

89
00:05:40,760 --> 00:05:46,240
trade, improved food production, and all those things that allow populations to boom.

90
00:05:46,240 --> 00:05:50,720
The historical and archaeological evidence shows that from the time of Jesus, it was

91
00:05:50,720 --> 00:05:55,160
1650 years before the population doubled.

92
00:05:55,160 --> 00:05:58,560
So AIG is out by a factor of around 10.

93
00:05:58,560 --> 00:06:02,640
But of course we're not going to use any of that fancy schmancy scientific or historical

94
00:06:02,640 --> 00:06:03,640
evidence.

95
00:06:03,640 --> 00:06:06,060
Let's go with AIG's figures.

96
00:06:06,060 --> 00:06:13,040
They say Egypt was founded by Mizraim and his family of 8 people in 2188 BC.

97
00:06:13,040 --> 00:06:20,480
And AIG says the earliest date for the pyramids was 2100 BC, just 88 years later.

98
00:06:20,480 --> 00:06:25,140
And AIG says the population doubled every 150 years.

99
00:06:25,140 --> 00:06:28,060
So it's just a simple mathematical calculation.

100
00:06:28,060 --> 00:06:34,820
By 2100 BC, there would have been about 12 of them.

101
00:06:34,820 --> 00:06:38,740
Well OK, let's say they just started work in 2100 BC.

102
00:06:38,740 --> 00:06:44,200
They've still got another 100 years to finish the project, according to AIG's date range.

103
00:06:44,200 --> 00:06:48,380
So there could be thousands of people toiling on the project by the end of it.

104
00:06:48,380 --> 00:06:49,500
No.

105
00:06:49,500 --> 00:06:55,020
According to AIG's population growth estimates, the descendants of Mizraim in 2000 BC would

106
00:06:55,020 --> 00:06:57,820
have numbered just over 16.

107
00:06:57,820 --> 00:07:02,700
Well, AIG reasons, maybe they had slaves.

108
00:07:02,700 --> 00:07:07,260
But that still doesn't solve the problem, because according to AIG, the world population

109
00:07:07,260 --> 00:07:11,240
in 2350 BC was just 8.

110
00:07:11,240 --> 00:07:16,180
So even if the entire world population was involved in building the first pyramid, that's

111
00:07:16,180 --> 00:07:20,980
still less than 40 people by the year 2000 BC.

112
00:07:20,980 --> 00:07:25,460
Well surely they had labour-saving devices like cranes and hoists.

113
00:07:25,460 --> 00:07:27,900
Yes, presumably they did.

114
00:07:27,900 --> 00:07:32,340
But they not only had to move the blocks and hoist them into place, they also had to quarry

115
00:07:32,340 --> 00:07:36,860
them and shape them with copper tools, and someone had to mine the copper, and someone

116
00:07:36,860 --> 00:07:41,960
had to smelt the metal, and make the tools, and someone had to sharpen the tools, which

117
00:07:41,960 --> 00:07:45,860
would get blunt very quickly, and someone had to make the dinner, and someone had to

118
00:07:45,860 --> 00:07:50,500
grow the food, and someone had to make the tools to grow the food, beginning to look

119
00:07:50,540 --> 00:07:54,700
like 40 men, women, and children just weren't enough.

120
00:07:54,700 --> 00:07:59,520
To get around this problem, Answers in Genesis does a bit of double bookkeeping.

121
00:07:59,520 --> 00:08:02,660
Change the rate of growth to make it fit.

122
00:08:02,660 --> 00:08:04,940
So what do we need to build a pyramid?

123
00:08:04,940 --> 00:08:07,200
Let's say about 30,000 people.

124
00:08:07,200 --> 00:08:12,380
And how do we get from one married couple to 30,000 in just 150 years?

125
00:08:12,380 --> 00:08:18,400
Well you have to double the population every 15 years, not every 150.

126
00:08:18,400 --> 00:08:20,800
So now that becomes the rate of growth.

127
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:24,200
AIG calls this probably quite conservative.

128
00:08:24,200 --> 00:08:29,120
I'm glad to see there's now an element of doubt in a population growth 100 times faster

129
00:08:29,120 --> 00:08:31,680
than the historical record shows.

130
00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:36,080
The new figure represents a breakneck speed of growth, and that creates another problem

131
00:08:36,080 --> 00:08:37,080
for AIG.

132
00:08:37,080 --> 00:08:42,820
A doubling of population every 15 years would mean Noah's three sons and their wives would

133
00:08:42,820 --> 00:08:47,900
have given us a population of 12 in 2335 BC.

134
00:08:47,900 --> 00:08:54,580
By 1885 BC, long before the founding of Rome, the population of the world would be nearly

135
00:08:54,580 --> 00:08:58,700
double what it is today, 12.9 billion.

136
00:08:58,700 --> 00:09:03,420
And if you extrapolated to the year 2015, there'd be more people on the planet than

137
00:09:03,420 --> 00:09:05,260
stars in the sky.

138
00:09:05,260 --> 00:09:10,180
We'd be groaning under the weight of trillions upon trillions of people.

139
00:09:10,180 --> 00:09:15,540
So how does AIG reconcile these two completely different population growth rates?

140
00:09:15,540 --> 00:09:16,740
It doesn't.

141
00:09:16,740 --> 00:09:18,340
It's like creative accounting.

142
00:09:18,340 --> 00:09:22,320
If people want to know how it's possible to reach a population of 7 billion in just a

143
00:09:22,320 --> 00:09:27,020
few thousand years, they're directed to one set of books that says the population doubled

144
00:09:27,020 --> 00:09:29,180
every 150 years.

145
00:09:29,180 --> 00:09:32,580
If they want to know how it's possible to reach a population capable of building the

146
00:09:32,580 --> 00:09:38,420
pyramids in just 150 years, direct them to another set of books that says the population

147
00:09:38,420 --> 00:09:41,980
doubled every 15 years, 10 times faster.

148
00:09:41,980 --> 00:09:47,980
Just hope no one asks both questions at the same time in the same room.

149
00:09:47,980 --> 00:09:52,480
Then we come on to another problem of trying to contort 500 million years of history into

150
00:09:52,480 --> 00:09:54,420
just 4,000 years.

151
00:09:54,420 --> 00:09:57,020
What on earth are the pyramids made of?

152
00:09:57,020 --> 00:09:59,320
Well, sandstone, of course.

153
00:09:59,320 --> 00:10:02,820
But this must be some kind of miraculous sandstone, surely.

154
00:10:02,820 --> 00:10:08,180
After all, sandstone is made of sand that's compressed and, over time, cemented together

155
00:10:08,180 --> 00:10:12,940
to form rocks solid enough to support the weight of several tonnes of pyramid.

156
00:10:12,940 --> 00:10:18,140
According to AIG, all the sedimentary rocks we find, including sandstone, were deposited

157
00:10:18,140 --> 00:10:19,900
by the global flood.

158
00:10:19,900 --> 00:10:24,320
So after the flood, they would have looked like this, soft and wet.

159
00:10:24,320 --> 00:10:28,900
So how can they form themselves into blocks of sandstone rock capable of holding up a

160
00:10:28,900 --> 00:10:33,500
massive pyramid in just 250 years?

161
00:10:33,500 --> 00:10:36,540
Answers in Genesis, as usual, has no answer.

162
00:10:36,540 --> 00:10:41,180
The closest I could get was this page, which said millions of years aren't needed for rocks

163
00:10:41,180 --> 00:10:45,420
to solidify, just compaction and the presence of cementing agents.

164
00:10:45,420 --> 00:10:47,960
Well, here's the problem with that.

165
00:10:47,960 --> 00:10:52,340
We know where the sandstone used to make the pyramids was quarried from, and it was near

166
00:10:52,340 --> 00:10:55,180
the surface, so it wasn't compacted.

167
00:10:55,180 --> 00:10:59,800
And if there were miraculous cementing agents, then how come this sand hasn't turned into

168
00:10:59,800 --> 00:11:03,100
solid rock in over 2,000 years?

169
00:11:03,100 --> 00:11:07,300
Archaeologists have found tonnes of sand used to fill in chambers, and they were sealed

170
00:11:07,300 --> 00:11:09,140
when the pyramids were built.

171
00:11:09,140 --> 00:11:15,780
They found skeletons from the time buried in sand, and the sand is still loose 2,000 years later.

172
00:11:15,780 --> 00:11:20,940
Yes, I know, if God could turn water into wine, then he could instantly turn sand into rock.

173
00:11:20,940 --> 00:11:26,180
But AIG goes to great lengths to show how the flood, and all the rocks it supposedly

174
00:11:26,180 --> 00:11:31,020
formed, happened naturally without resorting to magical solutions.

175
00:11:31,060 --> 00:11:36,140
So once again, answers in Genesis has no answers, so I look forward to your letters.

176
00:11:36,140 --> 00:11:40,860
Oh, and before the creationists out there yell at me for ignoring the explanation AIG

177
00:11:40,860 --> 00:11:45,900
gives as to how clocks and spark plugs and handbags and hats have petrified, in other

178
00:11:45,900 --> 00:11:51,180
words turned into rock, in just a few years, I haven't ignored it, I've covered this nonsense

179
00:11:51,180 --> 00:11:55,380
in my video Rapid Fossilisation of Hats Debunked.

180
00:11:55,380 --> 00:12:00,980
To recap, these objects haven't been petrified, they've had concretions deposited on them,

181
00:12:00,980 --> 00:12:06,220
in much the same way as concretions form around the sinkhole in your bath, or in objects

182
00:12:06,220 --> 00:12:09,060
placed in heavily mineralised water.

183
00:12:09,060 --> 00:12:15,020
So we have two problems with building the pyramids in a post-flood world, no people,

184
00:12:15,020 --> 00:12:20,740
and no sandstone, and if AIG wants to argue that there were enough people, then guys just

185
00:12:20,740 --> 00:12:25,780
talk among yourselves, because elsewhere on your channel you show very convincingly that

186
00:12:25,780 --> 00:12:27,100
there weren't.

187
00:12:27,620 --> 00:12:32,820
Ah, but it's not all bad news for creationists, at least you have Kent Hovind back, and on

188
00:12:32,820 --> 00:12:37,300
behalf of the atheist community, I'm delighted to welcome him out of prison.

189
00:12:37,300 --> 00:12:43,060
Because as you know, I have a love-hate relationship with creationists, they're so nice and lovable,

190
00:12:43,060 --> 00:12:46,700
and they probably feel the same way about us, I'm sure they understand that we could

191
00:12:46,700 --> 00:12:52,180
all be friends if only… well, you know how those dumb beliefs just keep getting in the

192
00:12:52,180 --> 00:12:53,180
way.

193
00:12:53,180 --> 00:12:58,500
I don't know, I just can't put it into words, perhaps the best way to express it is in song.
