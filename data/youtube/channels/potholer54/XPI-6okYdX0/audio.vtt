00:00.000 --> 00:03.060
Great, steaming lumps of Thirk!

00:03.060 --> 00:05.560
Kent Hovind's busted out of jail.

00:05.560 --> 00:09.520
And what a wonderful gift the Lugemeister gave me on his release.

00:09.520 --> 00:14.100
In his very first video, he starts off talking about something that was going to be the subject

00:14.100 --> 00:16.760
of my next video, this video.

00:16.760 --> 00:20.080
But if you add up the dates given in the Bible, you'll find what everybody else has found

00:20.080 --> 00:21.680
through history that's done this.

00:21.680 --> 00:26.520
The Bible dates indicate the Earth was created in six days about 6,000 years ago.

00:26.520 --> 00:29.820
It is not millions or billions of years old.

00:29.820 --> 00:32.660
So this top timeline kind of indicates what the Bible teaches.

00:32.660 --> 00:37.140
6,000 years ago, or 4,000 BC, God created everything.

00:37.140 --> 00:42.140
4,400 years ago, there was a big flood in the days of Noah that destroyed everything.

00:42.140 --> 00:47.360
And that flood explains all the geology of the world, the canyons, the mountain ranges,

00:47.360 --> 00:49.700
the ocean basins, the continental shelf.

00:49.700 --> 00:54.140
And we cover all that on video number five or six of our series, which you can see right

00:54.140 --> 00:56.140
here on the YouTube channel.

00:56.140 --> 01:00.740
When Jesus came 2,000 years ago, and here we are today, 2015, today happens to be July

01:00.740 --> 01:06.740
20th, and the Lord's coming back probably, hopefully, soon, next to 10, 15 years, we'll

01:06.740 --> 01:07.740
see about that.

01:07.740 --> 01:12.620
Yeah, that's kind of what fundamentalists have been saying for the last 2,000 years.

01:12.620 --> 01:16.900
But credit where credit's due, Kent Hovind's absolutely right.

01:16.900 --> 01:21.060
Seriously, if you add up the dates in the Bible, they produce an age for the universe

01:21.060 --> 01:24.260
and the Earth of just 6,000 years.

01:24.300 --> 01:29.820
That's why we know the Bible's full of crap, at least when it comes to scientific details.

01:29.820 --> 01:35.060
Because we've already seen in previous videos how four billion years of geological history

01:35.060 --> 01:40.020
doesn't fit into just 6,000 years, and how three and a half billion years of evolutionary

01:40.020 --> 01:43.940
history doesn't fit into just 4,500 years.

01:43.940 --> 01:48.820
And in this video, we're going to see how over 5,000 years of Egyptian history can't

01:48.820 --> 01:51.540
squeeze into 3,000 years.

01:51.540 --> 01:55.740
And unusually for this channel, we're not going to do it with historical, archaeological

01:55.740 --> 01:57.820
or scientific evidence.

01:57.820 --> 01:59.300
That would be too easy.

01:59.300 --> 02:03.060
I'm going to let creationists argue with themselves.

02:03.060 --> 02:08.100
For example, the fundamentalist encyclopedia, Conservopedia, tells us the chronology of

02:08.100 --> 02:14.420
ancient Egypt, the idea that Egyptian civilisation is 5,000 years old, is the least settled of

02:14.420 --> 02:17.780
all the chronologies of the great powers of the ancient Near East.

02:17.780 --> 02:19.380
Highly dubious at best.

02:19.380 --> 02:23.060
Moreover, an increasing body of evidence now suggests that the history of ancient Egypt

02:23.060 --> 02:27.980
is shorter, by several millennia, than most scholars have previously supposed.

02:27.980 --> 02:33.060
More recent research now strongly supports the original conclusion of James Usher.

02:33.060 --> 02:38.140
In other words, it supports Usher's conclusion that the world is just 6,000 years old, and

02:38.140 --> 02:43.700
that Egyptian civilisation arose after the Biblical flood 4,500 years ago.

02:43.700 --> 02:45.660
What research supports this?

02:45.660 --> 02:48.660
Maybe a paper in the Journal of Archaeological Research?

02:48.660 --> 02:49.940
Or Egyptian Archaeology?

02:49.940 --> 02:52.380
Or the International Journal of Historical Archaeology?

02:52.380 --> 02:53.540
Or World Archaeology?

02:53.540 --> 02:55.260
Or the Journal of Egyptian Archaeology?

02:55.260 --> 02:57.300
Or the Journal of Anthropology and Archaeology?

02:57.300 --> 02:59.300
I can't wait to find out.

02:59.300 --> 03:05.300
Well if we click on the reference link, we find it's a website run by Creationist Ministries

03:05.300 --> 03:07.180
International.

03:07.180 --> 03:11.980
This is Conservopedia's source that an increasing body of evidence now suggests that the history

03:11.980 --> 03:17.340
of ancient Egypt is shorter, by several millennia, than most scholars previously supposed.

03:17.340 --> 03:22.460
And it's based, as you can see, on Biblical stories and what Creationist Ministry International

03:22.460 --> 03:25.380
calls the truth and authority of the Bible.

03:25.380 --> 03:30.460
Meanwhile, most scholars and most encyclopedias still go with the wealth of archaeological

03:30.460 --> 03:33.740
evidence, like this one.

03:33.740 --> 03:38.660
Egypt has endured as a unified state for more than 5,000 years, it says, and archaeological

03:38.660 --> 03:43.900
evidence indicates that a developed Egyptian society has existed for much longer.

03:43.900 --> 03:47.320
And another entry in the same encyclopaedia concurs.

03:47.320 --> 03:49.900
So which encyclopaedia is it?

03:49.900 --> 03:50.900
Wait what?

03:50.900 --> 03:52.380
Great knobbly plates of toast!

03:52.380 --> 03:57.380
It's Conservopedia, the same encyclopaedia that told us this great age was dubious at

03:57.380 --> 04:01.100
best and contradicted by more recent research.

04:01.100 --> 04:06.860
And if we click on the link to Egyptian Chronology, we come to, yes, that very page.

04:06.860 --> 04:12.140
So on the one hand, Conservopedia is telling us Egyptian civilisation is 5,000 years old,

04:12.140 --> 04:16.420
and on the other hand Conservopedia is telling us this is nonsense.

04:16.420 --> 04:20.780
That's what you get when you try to squeeze things into timescales that don't fit.

04:20.780 --> 04:23.980
You end up with your foot inside your own mouth.

04:23.980 --> 04:27.840
But again, I'm not going to argue with these creationists, I'll let them carry on arguing

04:27.840 --> 04:29.260
with themselves.

04:29.260 --> 04:36.500
According to answers in Genesis, the Biblical flood dates to 2,348 BC, and 160 years after

04:36.500 --> 04:41.940
the flood had subsided, according to answers in Genesis, a grandson of Noah, Mizraim, took

04:41.940 --> 04:47.140
his family to settle in Egypt in 2,188 BC.

04:47.140 --> 04:50.500
So when did his descendants build the first large pyramid?

04:50.500 --> 04:56.500
No, not that pyramid, this is the first large pyramid, called the step pyramid.

04:56.500 --> 05:02.320
Answers in Genesis tells us it was built between 2100 to 2000 BC.

05:02.320 --> 05:07.240
Although the pyramid builders would have started work on it just 88 years after AIG

05:07.240 --> 05:11.240
tells us the first family of humans arrived to settle Egypt.

05:11.240 --> 05:14.040
So how many people were around to do this?

05:14.040 --> 05:20.180
AIG claims that since the flood, the human population has doubled every 150 years.

05:20.180 --> 05:24.920
And if you double the population every 150 years, you conveniently go from 8 people on

05:24.920 --> 05:28.320
the ark to around 7 billion people on Earth today.

05:28.320 --> 05:34.080
AIG calls this estimate very conservative by comparing it with population growth in

05:34.080 --> 05:35.720
the modern era.

05:35.720 --> 05:40.760
But of course in the modern era we have medicine, inoculation against disease, sanitation, welfare,

05:40.760 --> 05:46.240
trade, improved food production, and all those things that allow populations to boom.

05:46.240 --> 05:50.720
The historical and archaeological evidence shows that from the time of Jesus, it was

05:50.720 --> 05:55.160
1650 years before the population doubled.

05:55.160 --> 05:58.560
So AIG is out by a factor of around 10.

05:58.560 --> 06:02.640
But of course we're not going to use any of that fancy schmancy scientific or historical

06:02.640 --> 06:03.640
evidence.

06:03.640 --> 06:06.060
Let's go with AIG's figures.

06:06.060 --> 06:13.040
They say Egypt was founded by Mizraim and his family of 8 people in 2188 BC.

06:13.040 --> 06:20.480
And AIG says the earliest date for the pyramids was 2100 BC, just 88 years later.

06:20.480 --> 06:25.140
And AIG says the population doubled every 150 years.

06:25.140 --> 06:28.060
So it's just a simple mathematical calculation.

06:28.060 --> 06:34.820
By 2100 BC, there would have been about 12 of them.

06:34.820 --> 06:38.740
Well OK, let's say they just started work in 2100 BC.

06:38.740 --> 06:44.200
They've still got another 100 years to finish the project, according to AIG's date range.

06:44.200 --> 06:48.380
So there could be thousands of people toiling on the project by the end of it.

06:48.380 --> 06:49.500
No.

06:49.500 --> 06:55.020
According to AIG's population growth estimates, the descendants of Mizraim in 2000 BC would

06:55.020 --> 06:57.820
have numbered just over 16.

06:57.820 --> 07:02.700
Well, AIG reasons, maybe they had slaves.

07:02.700 --> 07:07.260
But that still doesn't solve the problem, because according to AIG, the world population

07:07.260 --> 07:11.240
in 2350 BC was just 8.

07:11.240 --> 07:16.180
So even if the entire world population was involved in building the first pyramid, that's

07:16.180 --> 07:20.980
still less than 40 people by the year 2000 BC.

07:20.980 --> 07:25.460
Well surely they had labour-saving devices like cranes and hoists.

07:25.460 --> 07:27.900
Yes, presumably they did.

07:27.900 --> 07:32.340
But they not only had to move the blocks and hoist them into place, they also had to quarry

07:32.340 --> 07:36.860
them and shape them with copper tools, and someone had to mine the copper, and someone

07:36.860 --> 07:41.960
had to smelt the metal, and make the tools, and someone had to sharpen the tools, which

07:41.960 --> 07:45.860
would get blunt very quickly, and someone had to make the dinner, and someone had to

07:45.860 --> 07:50.500
grow the food, and someone had to make the tools to grow the food, beginning to look

07:50.540 --> 07:54.700
like 40 men, women, and children just weren't enough.

07:54.700 --> 07:59.520
To get around this problem, Answers in Genesis does a bit of double bookkeeping.

07:59.520 --> 08:02.660
Change the rate of growth to make it fit.

08:02.660 --> 08:04.940
So what do we need to build a pyramid?

08:04.940 --> 08:07.200
Let's say about 30,000 people.

08:07.200 --> 08:12.380
And how do we get from one married couple to 30,000 in just 150 years?

08:12.380 --> 08:18.400
Well you have to double the population every 15 years, not every 150.

08:18.400 --> 08:20.800
So now that becomes the rate of growth.

08:20.800 --> 08:24.200
AIG calls this probably quite conservative.

08:24.200 --> 08:29.120
I'm glad to see there's now an element of doubt in a population growth 100 times faster

08:29.120 --> 08:31.680
than the historical record shows.

08:31.680 --> 08:36.080
The new figure represents a breakneck speed of growth, and that creates another problem

08:36.080 --> 08:37.080
for AIG.

08:37.080 --> 08:42.820
A doubling of population every 15 years would mean Noah's three sons and their wives would

08:42.820 --> 08:47.900
have given us a population of 12 in 2335 BC.

08:47.900 --> 08:54.580
By 1885 BC, long before the founding of Rome, the population of the world would be nearly

08:54.580 --> 08:58.700
double what it is today, 12.9 billion.

08:58.700 --> 09:03.420
And if you extrapolated to the year 2015, there'd be more people on the planet than

09:03.420 --> 09:05.260
stars in the sky.

09:05.260 --> 09:10.180
We'd be groaning under the weight of trillions upon trillions of people.

09:10.180 --> 09:15.540
So how does AIG reconcile these two completely different population growth rates?

09:15.540 --> 09:16.740
It doesn't.

09:16.740 --> 09:18.340
It's like creative accounting.

09:18.340 --> 09:22.320
If people want to know how it's possible to reach a population of 7 billion in just a

09:22.320 --> 09:27.020
few thousand years, they're directed to one set of books that says the population doubled

09:27.020 --> 09:29.180
every 150 years.

09:29.180 --> 09:32.580
If they want to know how it's possible to reach a population capable of building the

09:32.580 --> 09:38.420
pyramids in just 150 years, direct them to another set of books that says the population

09:38.420 --> 09:41.980
doubled every 15 years, 10 times faster.

09:41.980 --> 09:47.980
Just hope no one asks both questions at the same time in the same room.

09:47.980 --> 09:52.480
Then we come on to another problem of trying to contort 500 million years of history into

09:52.480 --> 09:54.420
just 4,000 years.

09:54.420 --> 09:57.020
What on earth are the pyramids made of?

09:57.020 --> 09:59.320
Well, sandstone, of course.

09:59.320 --> 10:02.820
But this must be some kind of miraculous sandstone, surely.

10:02.820 --> 10:08.180
After all, sandstone is made of sand that's compressed and, over time, cemented together

10:08.180 --> 10:12.940
to form rocks solid enough to support the weight of several tonnes of pyramid.

10:12.940 --> 10:18.140
According to AIG, all the sedimentary rocks we find, including sandstone, were deposited

10:18.140 --> 10:19.900
by the global flood.

10:19.900 --> 10:24.320
So after the flood, they would have looked like this, soft and wet.

10:24.320 --> 10:28.900
So how can they form themselves into blocks of sandstone rock capable of holding up a

10:28.900 --> 10:33.500
massive pyramid in just 250 years?

10:33.500 --> 10:36.540
Answers in Genesis, as usual, has no answer.

10:36.540 --> 10:41.180
The closest I could get was this page, which said millions of years aren't needed for rocks

10:41.180 --> 10:45.420
to solidify, just compaction and the presence of cementing agents.

10:45.420 --> 10:47.960
Well, here's the problem with that.

10:47.960 --> 10:52.340
We know where the sandstone used to make the pyramids was quarried from, and it was near

10:52.340 --> 10:55.180
the surface, so it wasn't compacted.

10:55.180 --> 10:59.800
And if there were miraculous cementing agents, then how come this sand hasn't turned into

10:59.800 --> 11:03.100
solid rock in over 2,000 years?

11:03.100 --> 11:07.300
Archaeologists have found tonnes of sand used to fill in chambers, and they were sealed

11:07.300 --> 11:09.140
when the pyramids were built.

11:09.140 --> 11:15.780
They found skeletons from the time buried in sand, and the sand is still loose 2,000 years later.

11:15.780 --> 11:20.940
Yes, I know, if God could turn water into wine, then he could instantly turn sand into rock.

11:20.940 --> 11:26.180
But AIG goes to great lengths to show how the flood, and all the rocks it supposedly

11:26.180 --> 11:31.020
formed, happened naturally without resorting to magical solutions.

11:31.060 --> 11:36.140
So once again, answers in Genesis has no answers, so I look forward to your letters.

11:36.140 --> 11:40.860
Oh, and before the creationists out there yell at me for ignoring the explanation AIG

11:40.860 --> 11:45.900
gives as to how clocks and spark plugs and handbags and hats have petrified, in other

11:45.900 --> 11:51.180
words turned into rock, in just a few years, I haven't ignored it, I've covered this nonsense

11:51.180 --> 11:55.380
in my video Rapid Fossilisation of Hats Debunked.

11:55.380 --> 12:00.980
To recap, these objects haven't been petrified, they've had concretions deposited on them,

12:00.980 --> 12:06.220
in much the same way as concretions form around the sinkhole in your bath, or in objects

12:06.220 --> 12:09.060
placed in heavily mineralised water.

12:09.060 --> 12:15.020
So we have two problems with building the pyramids in a post-flood world, no people,

12:15.020 --> 12:20.740
and no sandstone, and if AIG wants to argue that there were enough people, then guys just

12:20.740 --> 12:25.780
talk among yourselves, because elsewhere on your channel you show very convincingly that

12:25.780 --> 12:27.100
there weren't.

12:27.620 --> 12:32.820
Ah, but it's not all bad news for creationists, at least you have Kent Hovind back, and on

12:32.820 --> 12:37.300
behalf of the atheist community, I'm delighted to welcome him out of prison.

12:37.300 --> 12:43.060
Because as you know, I have a love-hate relationship with creationists, they're so nice and lovable,

12:43.060 --> 12:46.700
and they probably feel the same way about us, I'm sure they understand that we could

12:46.700 --> 12:52.180
all be friends if only… well, you know how those dumb beliefs just keep getting in the

12:52.180 --> 12:53.180
way.

12:53.180 --> 12:58.500
I don't know, I just can't put it into words, perhaps the best way to express it is in song.
