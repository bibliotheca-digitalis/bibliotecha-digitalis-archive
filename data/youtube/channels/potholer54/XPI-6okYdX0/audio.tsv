0	3060	Great, steaming lumps of Thirk!
3060	5560	Kent Hovind's busted out of jail.
5560	9520	And what a wonderful gift the Lugemeister gave me on his release.
9520	14100	In his very first video, he starts off talking about something that was going to be the subject
14100	16760	of my next video, this video.
16760	20080	But if you add up the dates given in the Bible, you'll find what everybody else has found
20080	21680	through history that's done this.
21680	26520	The Bible dates indicate the Earth was created in six days about 6,000 years ago.
26520	29820	It is not millions or billions of years old.
29820	32660	So this top timeline kind of indicates what the Bible teaches.
32660	37140	6,000 years ago, or 4,000 BC, God created everything.
37140	42140	4,400 years ago, there was a big flood in the days of Noah that destroyed everything.
42140	47360	And that flood explains all the geology of the world, the canyons, the mountain ranges,
47360	49700	the ocean basins, the continental shelf.
49700	54140	And we cover all that on video number five or six of our series, which you can see right
54140	56140	here on the YouTube channel.
56140	60740	When Jesus came 2,000 years ago, and here we are today, 2015, today happens to be July
60740	66740	20th, and the Lord's coming back probably, hopefully, soon, next to 10, 15 years, we'll
66740	67740	see about that.
67740	72620	Yeah, that's kind of what fundamentalists have been saying for the last 2,000 years.
72620	76900	But credit where credit's due, Kent Hovind's absolutely right.
76900	81060	Seriously, if you add up the dates in the Bible, they produce an age for the universe
81060	84260	and the Earth of just 6,000 years.
84300	89820	That's why we know the Bible's full of crap, at least when it comes to scientific details.
89820	95060	Because we've already seen in previous videos how four billion years of geological history
95060	100020	doesn't fit into just 6,000 years, and how three and a half billion years of evolutionary
100020	103940	history doesn't fit into just 4,500 years.
103940	108820	And in this video, we're going to see how over 5,000 years of Egyptian history can't
108820	111540	squeeze into 3,000 years.
111540	115740	And unusually for this channel, we're not going to do it with historical, archaeological
115740	117820	or scientific evidence.
117820	119300	That would be too easy.
119300	123060	I'm going to let creationists argue with themselves.
123060	128100	For example, the fundamentalist encyclopedia, Conservopedia, tells us the chronology of
128100	134420	ancient Egypt, the idea that Egyptian civilisation is 5,000 years old, is the least settled of
134420	137780	all the chronologies of the great powers of the ancient Near East.
137780	139380	Highly dubious at best.
139380	143060	Moreover, an increasing body of evidence now suggests that the history of ancient Egypt
143060	147980	is shorter, by several millennia, than most scholars have previously supposed.
147980	153060	More recent research now strongly supports the original conclusion of James Usher.
153060	158140	In other words, it supports Usher's conclusion that the world is just 6,000 years old, and
158140	163700	that Egyptian civilisation arose after the Biblical flood 4,500 years ago.
163700	165660	What research supports this?
165660	168660	Maybe a paper in the Journal of Archaeological Research?
168660	169940	Or Egyptian Archaeology?
169940	172380	Or the International Journal of Historical Archaeology?
172380	173540	Or World Archaeology?
173540	175260	Or the Journal of Egyptian Archaeology?
175260	177300	Or the Journal of Anthropology and Archaeology?
177300	179300	I can't wait to find out.
179300	185300	Well if we click on the reference link, we find it's a website run by Creationist Ministries
185300	187180	International.
187180	191980	This is Conservopedia's source that an increasing body of evidence now suggests that the history
191980	197340	of ancient Egypt is shorter, by several millennia, than most scholars previously supposed.
197340	202460	And it's based, as you can see, on Biblical stories and what Creationist Ministry International
202460	205380	calls the truth and authority of the Bible.
205380	210460	Meanwhile, most scholars and most encyclopedias still go with the wealth of archaeological
210460	213740	evidence, like this one.
213740	218660	Egypt has endured as a unified state for more than 5,000 years, it says, and archaeological
218660	223900	evidence indicates that a developed Egyptian society has existed for much longer.
223900	227320	And another entry in the same encyclopaedia concurs.
227320	229900	So which encyclopaedia is it?
229900	230900	Wait what?
230900	232380	Great knobbly plates of toast!
232380	237380	It's Conservopedia, the same encyclopaedia that told us this great age was dubious at
237380	241100	best and contradicted by more recent research.
241100	246860	And if we click on the link to Egyptian Chronology, we come to, yes, that very page.
246860	252140	So on the one hand, Conservopedia is telling us Egyptian civilisation is 5,000 years old,
252140	256420	and on the other hand Conservopedia is telling us this is nonsense.
256420	260780	That's what you get when you try to squeeze things into timescales that don't fit.
260780	263980	You end up with your foot inside your own mouth.
263980	267840	But again, I'm not going to argue with these creationists, I'll let them carry on arguing
267840	269260	with themselves.
269260	276500	According to answers in Genesis, the Biblical flood dates to 2,348 BC, and 160 years after
276500	281940	the flood had subsided, according to answers in Genesis, a grandson of Noah, Mizraim, took
281940	287140	his family to settle in Egypt in 2,188 BC.
287140	290500	So when did his descendants build the first large pyramid?
290500	296500	No, not that pyramid, this is the first large pyramid, called the step pyramid.
296500	302320	Answers in Genesis tells us it was built between 2100 to 2000 BC.
302320	307240	Although the pyramid builders would have started work on it just 88 years after AIG
307240	311240	tells us the first family of humans arrived to settle Egypt.
311240	314040	So how many people were around to do this?
314040	320180	AIG claims that since the flood, the human population has doubled every 150 years.
320180	324920	And if you double the population every 150 years, you conveniently go from 8 people on
324920	328320	the ark to around 7 billion people on Earth today.
328320	334080	AIG calls this estimate very conservative by comparing it with population growth in
334080	335720	the modern era.
335720	340760	But of course in the modern era we have medicine, inoculation against disease, sanitation, welfare,
340760	346240	trade, improved food production, and all those things that allow populations to boom.
346240	350720	The historical and archaeological evidence shows that from the time of Jesus, it was
350720	355160	1650 years before the population doubled.
355160	358560	So AIG is out by a factor of around 10.
358560	362640	But of course we're not going to use any of that fancy schmancy scientific or historical
362640	363640	evidence.
363640	366060	Let's go with AIG's figures.
366060	373040	They say Egypt was founded by Mizraim and his family of 8 people in 2188 BC.
373040	380480	And AIG says the earliest date for the pyramids was 2100 BC, just 88 years later.
380480	385140	And AIG says the population doubled every 150 years.
385140	388060	So it's just a simple mathematical calculation.
388060	394820	By 2100 BC, there would have been about 12 of them.
394820	398740	Well OK, let's say they just started work in 2100 BC.
398740	404200	They've still got another 100 years to finish the project, according to AIG's date range.
404200	408380	So there could be thousands of people toiling on the project by the end of it.
408380	409500	No.
409500	415020	According to AIG's population growth estimates, the descendants of Mizraim in 2000 BC would
415020	417820	have numbered just over 16.
417820	422700	Well, AIG reasons, maybe they had slaves.
422700	427260	But that still doesn't solve the problem, because according to AIG, the world population
427260	431240	in 2350 BC was just 8.
431240	436180	So even if the entire world population was involved in building the first pyramid, that's
436180	440980	still less than 40 people by the year 2000 BC.
440980	445460	Well surely they had labour-saving devices like cranes and hoists.
445460	447900	Yes, presumably they did.
447900	452340	But they not only had to move the blocks and hoist them into place, they also had to quarry
452340	456860	them and shape them with copper tools, and someone had to mine the copper, and someone
456860	461960	had to smelt the metal, and make the tools, and someone had to sharpen the tools, which
461960	465860	would get blunt very quickly, and someone had to make the dinner, and someone had to
465860	470500	grow the food, and someone had to make the tools to grow the food, beginning to look
470540	474700	like 40 men, women, and children just weren't enough.
474700	479520	To get around this problem, Answers in Genesis does a bit of double bookkeeping.
479520	482660	Change the rate of growth to make it fit.
482660	484940	So what do we need to build a pyramid?
484940	487200	Let's say about 30,000 people.
487200	492380	And how do we get from one married couple to 30,000 in just 150 years?
492380	498400	Well you have to double the population every 15 years, not every 150.
498400	500800	So now that becomes the rate of growth.
500800	504200	AIG calls this probably quite conservative.
504200	509120	I'm glad to see there's now an element of doubt in a population growth 100 times faster
509120	511680	than the historical record shows.
511680	516080	The new figure represents a breakneck speed of growth, and that creates another problem
516080	517080	for AIG.
517080	522820	A doubling of population every 15 years would mean Noah's three sons and their wives would
522820	527900	have given us a population of 12 in 2335 BC.
527900	534580	By 1885 BC, long before the founding of Rome, the population of the world would be nearly
534580	538700	double what it is today, 12.9 billion.
538700	543420	And if you extrapolated to the year 2015, there'd be more people on the planet than
543420	545260	stars in the sky.
545260	550180	We'd be groaning under the weight of trillions upon trillions of people.
550180	555540	So how does AIG reconcile these two completely different population growth rates?
555540	556740	It doesn't.
556740	558340	It's like creative accounting.
558340	562320	If people want to know how it's possible to reach a population of 7 billion in just a
562320	567020	few thousand years, they're directed to one set of books that says the population doubled
567020	569180	every 150 years.
569180	572580	If they want to know how it's possible to reach a population capable of building the
572580	578420	pyramids in just 150 years, direct them to another set of books that says the population
578420	581980	doubled every 15 years, 10 times faster.
581980	587980	Just hope no one asks both questions at the same time in the same room.
587980	592480	Then we come on to another problem of trying to contort 500 million years of history into
592480	594420	just 4,000 years.
594420	597020	What on earth are the pyramids made of?
597020	599320	Well, sandstone, of course.
599320	602820	But this must be some kind of miraculous sandstone, surely.
602820	608180	After all, sandstone is made of sand that's compressed and, over time, cemented together
608180	612940	to form rocks solid enough to support the weight of several tonnes of pyramid.
612940	618140	According to AIG, all the sedimentary rocks we find, including sandstone, were deposited
618140	619900	by the global flood.
619900	624320	So after the flood, they would have looked like this, soft and wet.
624320	628900	So how can they form themselves into blocks of sandstone rock capable of holding up a
628900	633500	massive pyramid in just 250 years?
633500	636540	Answers in Genesis, as usual, has no answer.
636540	641180	The closest I could get was this page, which said millions of years aren't needed for rocks
641180	645420	to solidify, just compaction and the presence of cementing agents.
645420	647960	Well, here's the problem with that.
647960	652340	We know where the sandstone used to make the pyramids was quarried from, and it was near
652340	655180	the surface, so it wasn't compacted.
655180	659800	And if there were miraculous cementing agents, then how come this sand hasn't turned into
659800	663100	solid rock in over 2,000 years?
663100	667300	Archaeologists have found tonnes of sand used to fill in chambers, and they were sealed
667300	669140	when the pyramids were built.
669140	675780	They found skeletons from the time buried in sand, and the sand is still loose 2,000 years later.
675780	680940	Yes, I know, if God could turn water into wine, then he could instantly turn sand into rock.
680940	686180	But AIG goes to great lengths to show how the flood, and all the rocks it supposedly
686180	691020	formed, happened naturally without resorting to magical solutions.
691060	696140	So once again, answers in Genesis has no answers, so I look forward to your letters.
696140	700860	Oh, and before the creationists out there yell at me for ignoring the explanation AIG
700860	705900	gives as to how clocks and spark plugs and handbags and hats have petrified, in other
705900	711180	words turned into rock, in just a few years, I haven't ignored it, I've covered this nonsense
711180	715380	in my video Rapid Fossilisation of Hats Debunked.
715380	720980	To recap, these objects haven't been petrified, they've had concretions deposited on them,
720980	726220	in much the same way as concretions form around the sinkhole in your bath, or in objects
726220	729060	placed in heavily mineralised water.
729060	735020	So we have two problems with building the pyramids in a post-flood world, no people,
735020	740740	and no sandstone, and if AIG wants to argue that there were enough people, then guys just
740740	745780	talk among yourselves, because elsewhere on your channel you show very convincingly that
745780	747100	there weren't.
747620	752820	Ah, but it's not all bad news for creationists, at least you have Kent Hovind back, and on
752820	757300	behalf of the atheist community, I'm delighted to welcome him out of prison.
757300	763060	Because as you know, I have a love-hate relationship with creationists, they're so nice and lovable,
763060	766700	and they probably feel the same way about us, I'm sure they understand that we could
766700	772180	all be friends if only… well, you know how those dumb beliefs just keep getting in the
772180	773180	way.
773180	778500	I don't know, I just can't put it into words, perhaps the best way to express it is in song.
