0	4000	And for that, the Australian government wants to bring the economy to its knees.
4000	6000	Say no to the carbon tax.
6000	10000	This message is brought to you by the Galileo movement.
10000	14000	No, this isn't a video about the carbon tax.
14000	18000	Whether you're for it or against it is your business, not mine.
18000	22000	What I'm interested in is this thing called the Galileo movement.
22000	26000	Whenever a particular group wants to challenge established science,
26000	32000	they like to compare themselves to Galileo, a lone voice crying out against the scientific consensus.
32000	38000	Trouble is, Galileo wasn't challenging the scientific consensus of the 17th century.
38000	42000	He was the scientific consensus of the 17th century,
42000	45000	which is why he's called the father of modern science.
45000	49000	What he was challenging was belief and dogma,
49000	53000	and the idea that just because authorities like the Pope or Aristotle
53000	57000	believes something to be true, that doesn't make it true.
57000	62000	What counts is evidence derived by the scientific method.
62000	67000	But this begs the question, is there a consensus on whether CO2 affects global temperature?
67000	71000	Citizen scientists can't seem to agree. Some say there isn't.
71000	75000	Or that we don't know whether there's a consensus or not.
75000	78000	Nobody knows what the majority of scientists think.
78000	80000	Well, let me attempt to break the tie.
80000	84000	We don't know if there's a consensus on any scientific theory.
84000	86000	Of course, if you feel the need to put a number on it,
86000	91000	you could quite easily count the number of papers consistent with a certain theory,
91000	94000	or the impact factors of the journals in which they're published,
94000	96000	or the number of times they've been cited,
96000	100000	or count up the position statements of scientific organisations.
100000	105000	No one ever takes a vote to see how many scientists support any theory,
105000	110000	whether it's climate change, evolution, or even whether the Earth orbits the Sun.
110000	115000	So, if scientists never get to vote on them, how do we know that these theories are correct?
115000	119000	And why do they end up being taught in schools and universities?
119000	124000	To explain how this works, let's take a look at the theory of plate tectonics as an example.
124000	128000	The theory didn't develop overnight because geologists voted for it.
128000	133000	It started with evidence showing continuity of fossils and rock types between continents.
133000	136000	And, of course, early on there were a lot of flaws in the theory,
136000	140000	and other hypotheses that explained the evidence that had been found.
140000	143000	Then came the discovery of magnetic alignment in rocks,
143000	146000	and oceanographers discovered magnetic striping.
146000	150000	Each step, each discovery, and each conclusion was written down
150000	153000	and published in peer-reviewed papers,
153000	156000	where the evidence could be checked and challenged or confirmed.
156000	159000	As more and more evidence supported the hypothesis,
159000	164000	fewer flaws were found, and therefore fewer rebuttal papers could find fault with it.
164000	168000	The hypothesis became a theory not because everyone voted for it,
168000	172000	but because the amount of evidence became so overwhelming that in the end
172000	175000	no one could find any serious flaws.
175000	178000	And no other hypothesis could explain the evidence.
178000	182000	Every scientific theory goes through exactly the same process.
182000	186000	Of course, there are always a few researchers who have a pet hypothesis
187000	191000	that they stick to even if they can't produce any evidence to support it.
191000	196000	What matters is not what these contrarians assert in blogs and TV interviews.
196000	202000	What matters is the evidence they publish in scientific papers supporting those assertions.
202000	205000	And if they don't have any evidence to publish,
205000	209000	then railing against a hypothesis may sway public opinion,
209000	212000	but it cuts no ice in the world of science.
213000	218000	Quoting what experts say in television interviews or blogs or even congressional inquiries
218000	221000	is called an argument from authority.
221000	225000	That's why I always check to see whether any public statement
225000	230000	is supported by a peer-reviewed paper published in a respected scientific journal.
230000	233000	And if it is, then I quote that.
233000	238000	The problem for contrarians is that most scientific theories are so well supported
238000	241000	that it's hard to find any scientists who still disagree with them.
241000	246000	So people from outside have to be trucked in and their credentials puffed up.
246000	253000	Here, for example, are some familiar activists who don't accept that CO2 is the long-term driver of climate,
253000	256000	along with the phony titles they've been given.
256000	259000	And here are their real fields of expertise.
259000	261000	Does that matter?
261000	267000	No, as long as their statements are backed by evidence they've published in peer-reviewed papers.
267000	269000	But they're not.
269000	273000	So quoting these guys is not only an argument from authority, it's worse.
273000	276000	It's an argument from a phony authority.
276000	281000	Of course, the methods used to attack paleoclimatology are exactly the same
281000	284000	as the methods used to attack paleontology.
284000	289000	Turn someone into an authority, and then argue from that phony authority.
289000	293000	Professor and science researcher Ian Juby.
293000	298000	If Ian Juby has evidence that a particular type of dinosaur laid its eggs in a different manner,
298000	305000	all he has to do is write a scientific paper on this astonishing discovery and submit it for publication.
305000	311000	If we look at climate through the geological timeframe, we would never suspect CO2 as a major climate driver.
311000	316000	And instead of going on television and telling us CO2 is not a long-term driver of climate change,
316000	323000	why doesn't Ian Clark submit a response paper to all those researchers who've shown that it clearly is?
323000	327000	After all, he's written hundreds of papers in his own field, which is geochemistry,
327000	332000	but for some reason, not one single paper related to the effects of CO2 on temperature.
332000	338000	He can say whatever he likes on television, but again, that cuts no ice with science.
338000	343000	And when I pointed out Bob Carter's lack of research in my video Meet the Scientists,
343000	346000	I got this comment from Easy S on the forum.
346000	352000	Pottola54, are you even aware of what someone who studies stratigraphic sequences does?
352000	358000	Well, I know it's hard to believe, but I did actually go through three years of stratigraphy lectures when I studied geology.
358000	363000	I admit I was asleep during half of them and hungover during the other half,
363000	366000	but I did manage to pass my stratigraphy exam at the end of it.
366000	370000	So I guess I do have an inkling of what a stratigrapher does.
370000	373000	And it's not the same as paleoclimatology.
373000	378000	Also, lots of the underpinning data that goes into paleoclimatology studies comes from the past climate expressed through stratigraphy.
378000	384000	Yes, it does. And in fact, we can see how Carter's work is important for paleoclimatology.
384000	390000	I took one of the few papers I could find of his that related to past climate and checked the citations.
390000	395000	It was cited by this paper. In other words, it was used, along with a lot of other research papers,
395000	399000	to help build up a picture of the Pliocene climate.
399000	405000	And that research paper was cited by this paper, which was then cited by this paper,
405000	411000	which was cited by this paper, showing a link between glaciation in Greenland during the late Pliocene
411000	414000	and a decline in atmospheric carbon dioxide.
414000	421000	So EZS is right. Carter's work does indeed underpin data that goes into paleoclimatology studies.
421000	427000	But unfortunately, it supports the correlation between CO2 and global temperature.
427000	433000	If Carter disagrees, why hasn't he published a paper detailing the reasons for his disagreement?
433000	440000	Of course, the answer is that writing a scientific paper isn't the same as writing an op-ed piece in the Daily Telegraph.
440000	446000	You can't just write, I'm one of the world's top paleoclimatologists, and I say global warming stopped. So there.
446000	452000	In a proper science paper, you have to explain what evidence you have that global warming stopped.
452000	455000	And that's something Carter can't do.
455000	460000	The other problem with publishing in a respected scientific journal is that your work is fact-checked.
460000	466000	So while you can get away with describing yourself as one of the world's top paleoclimatologists in a book,
466000	471000	you can't get away with it in a scientific paper just to make you seem more important.
471000	475000	Of course, if you don't name your expert, you can give him any credentials you like.
475000	480000	You can even pretend he has a publishing history without fear that anyone will be able to check.
480000	486000	The governor's source has led June Sarpong to a small town on the outskirts of civilization.
486000	492000	It's here that a global warming critic says he's hiding for his life.
492000	499000	I admit, I'm worried. Once I get to the other side, I'm going to be out of cell phone range.
499000	504000	I don't know if anyone's following me or what to expect.
504000	508000	She finds a man who does not want to be seen or named.
508000	516000	A climate scientist who's been at the top of his field since the 1970s when the concern was global cooling.
516000	520000	Can you tell us why you're in silhouette today for this interview?
520000	524000	Well, because of the attacks on me personally.
524000	528000	Now I've got no idea who this mystery climatologist is.
528000	533000	One person we know it definitely isn't is Professor Tim Ball.
533000	541000	After all, the climatologist in hiding is described as a climate scientist who's been at the top of his field since the 1970s.
541000	544000	And we know that Tim Ball is a retired geography professor.
544000	550000	He didn't study climatology until the 1980s and his only contribution to climatology research
550000	555000	was three papers looking at the historical weather records of the Hudson's Bay Company,
555000	557000	all of them now around 30 years old.
557000	559000	So what do you think is causing global warming?
559000	562000	The sun. There's absolutely no question.
562000	569000	The sun is virtually ignored by the authorities and particularly the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change.
569000	574000	Well, now we definitely know it's not Tim Ball because Tim Ball doesn't sound anything like that.
574000	577000	They virtually ignore the sun as a factor of climate change.
577000	586000	Well, that's funny. Excuse me a second. Tim? Hello? Tim? Is that you? I can see you.
586000	595000	Yes, it is you, Tim. Now, I'm sure conspiracy theorists tell me I'm endangering Tim Ball's life by exposing the identity of the mystery shadow man.
595000	602000	Well, if Ball really was in fear of his life, it's odd that he's appeared on television programmes and given public speeches
602000	609000	and plastered his photo on website blogs many times since the conspiracy show was broadcast in 2009.
609000	612000	He doesn't seem that concerned.
612000	616000	Can you tell us why you're in silhouette today for this interview?
616000	619000	Well, that's a very good question, June.
619000	624000	Could it be that your producers didn't think the conspiracy show would be much of a conspiracy show
624000	628000	if it didn't have people hiding in the darkness because of a conspiracy against them
628000	635000	and interviewers being scared that they're followed to the outskirts of civilisation, in other words, Canada, where Tim Ball lives?
635000	639000	Could it be that disguising him means that we have to take your word that we're listening to
639000	643000	a climate scientist who's been at the top of his field since the 1970s
643000	649000	rather than a retired geography professor who's never published any papers in the field he's pontificating about?
649000	651000	Could that be the reason?
651000	656000	Sounds like a familiar tactic from those whose beliefs clash with scientific conclusions.
656000	663000	I'm having the pleasure of sitting down with a geophysicist that unfortunately has to remain anonymous.
663000	664000	So, can I call you Steve?
664000	665000	My name's Gladys.
665000	670000	Alright, so Steve is going to share with us… no, just Steve, let me ask you as a geophysicist…
670000	675000	Still, Tim Ball is one of the few climate activists who's actually studied climatology,
675000	680000	and that prompted this post from Straight Forever on my Meet the Scientist video forum.
680000	687000	I study geography, and within the geography department where I study, there are people there who study different fields within geography,
687000	689000	climatology being one of them.
689000	694000	This person is therefore a climatologist and not a geography lecturer-professor.
694000	702000	Sorry to disagree back, but Tim Ball was a geography professor and even describes himself as a geography professor
702000	706000	when he's writing to people who can separate academic truth from bullshit.
706000	715000	He only describes himself as a climatology professor when he's trying to impress politicians and members of the public who don't know any better.
715000	720000	As I showed in the video, there is no department of climatology at the University of Winnipeg,
720000	727000	but even if you still want to insist he's an expert on climatology, the same rule applies to all the other experts,
727000	733000	they can't just make pronouncements on TV and tell us we have to believe them because they're experts,
733000	739000	they have to publish their evidence so that other scientists can test it and check it and challenge it.
739000	741000	Ball hasn't.
741000	748000	And if you still want to insist he's an expert, then let's test that by seeing how much he actually knows.
750000	751000	We'll start with this.
751000	756000	I started in 1968 and at that time global cooling was the consensus.
756000	761000	Now there are people out there that have tried to say, oh it wasn't the consensus, well I can tell you it was.
761000	766000	I was not only in it, I was teaching it and researching it as well.
766000	768000	Hang on a second, what date was that?
768000	769000	In 1968.
769000	778000	1968? But according to your own bio, you weren't teaching it, you were a search and rescue operations officer at that time,
778000	783000	and you didn't do your doctorate in climatology until the 1980s.
783000	790000	So what evidence do you have that there was a consensus on global cooling except for a faulty memory?
790000	796000	If Ball had taken the time to read papers that predicted future temperature trends in the 1960s and 70s,
796000	801000	he'd find that 44 predicted warming and 7 predicted cooling.
801000	806000	Ball also seems to be confused about what his supposed area of expertise is called.
806000	813000	They started with global warming and then when they realised that the global temperature was going down since 2000,
813000	818000	even though CO2 continued to rise, and they started talking about climate change.
818000	823000	Which makes me wonder whether he's read any climate science papers in the last 25 years.
823000	828000	Not only was this phenomenon called climatic change as far back as the 1950s,
828000	836000	we even have something called the IPCC, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, set up in the 1980s.
836000	843000	Global warming is a colloquial term meaning exactly what it says, the overall warming of the earth.
843000	848000	Climate change is the change in climate that results from that warming.
848000	850000	And then we come to this.
850000	854000	For example, they virtually ignore the sun as a factor of climate change.
854000	858000	Now anyone who reads scientific journals that deal with climate science
858000	863000	will be well aware of the huge amount of research that's gone into the role of the sun in warming.
863000	867000	Even I've read these papers, Tim, and I'm not a climate scientist.
867000	873000	What goes for Tim Ball goes for every other phony expert who eschews scientific research
873000	878000	in favour of TV interviews, newspaper opinion and amateur dramatics.
878000	886000	If there really were hundreds of climate scientists who disagree that CO2 is a long-term driver of climate, where are they?
886000	890000	How come TV programmes and congressional inquiries can't find them
890000	895000	and have to resort to using people who've never published any research in this field
895000	898000	and then make up phony titles for them?
898000	900000	And more to the point, where are their papers?
900000	906000	Even the busiest armchair scientists who deluge my channel with links can't find them.
906000	910000	So thanks for all the links to blogs, videos and data.
910000	914000	And the occasional scientific paper showing facts that no-one is disputing.
914000	919000	And thanks for letting me know that there are unknowns in climatology and biology
919000	922000	just as there are unknowns in any scientific field.
922000	924000	That's why we do research.
924000	927000	Was the medieval warm period global?
927000	930000	Is atmospheric heat being taken up in the deep oceans?
930000	933000	What's the contribution of epigenetics to evolution?
933000	935000	How did giraffes evolve?
935000	937000	Why are there hotspots in the mantle?
937000	942000	What's the relationship between currents in the mantle and continental drift?
942000	948000	Those who want to undermine scientific theories love to focus on the questions and the unknowns
948000	953000	to imply that if we don't know some things, then we can't know anything.
953000	957000	But they never tackle the evidence that gave us these theories in the first place
957000	960000	because that evidence is as solid as it gets.
960000	965000	If you're interested in having a go, I've outlined the evidence for the CO2 temperature link
965000	970000	in my video The Evidence for Climate Change without Computer Models or the IPCC.
970000	975000	And I've outlined the evidence for evolution in my videos Natural Selection Made Easy
975000	978000	and The Theory of Evolution Made Easy.
978000	982000	So check the papers I cite and see if you can find response papers
982000	987000	or any papers published in respected scientific journals that find fault with them.
987000	995000	Simply listing names and appealing to authority, let alone a phony authority, is not how science is done.
995000	1000000	Before Galileo came along, this kind of argument from authority might have worked.
1000000	1005000	But thanks to him and other pioneers of science, we've learnt that what counts is not dogma
1005000	1010000	or the assertions of experts or the assertions of people who pretend to be experts.
1010000	1014000	What matters is evidence that's peer-reviewed and published
1014000	1018000	so it can be examined, tested, replicated, fact-checked and faulted.
1018000	1022000	That, after all, is what Galileo would do.
1022000	1027000	It's the nearest thing we have to knowing what the consensus is in science.
