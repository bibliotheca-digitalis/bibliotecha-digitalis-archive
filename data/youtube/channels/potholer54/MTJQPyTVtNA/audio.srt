1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
And for that, the Australian government wants to bring the economy to its knees.

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:06,000
Say no to the carbon tax.

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:10,000
This message is brought to you by the Galileo movement.

4
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:14,000
No, this isn't a video about the carbon tax.

5
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:18,000
Whether you're for it or against it is your business, not mine.

6
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:22,000
What I'm interested in is this thing called the Galileo movement.

7
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:26,000
Whenever a particular group wants to challenge established science,

8
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:32,000
they like to compare themselves to Galileo, a lone voice crying out against the scientific consensus.

9
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:38,000
Trouble is, Galileo wasn't challenging the scientific consensus of the 17th century.

10
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:42,000
He was the scientific consensus of the 17th century,

11
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:45,000
which is why he's called the father of modern science.

12
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:49,000
What he was challenging was belief and dogma,

13
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:53,000
and the idea that just because authorities like the Pope or Aristotle

14
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:57,000
believes something to be true, that doesn't make it true.

15
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:02,000
What counts is evidence derived by the scientific method.

16
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:07,000
But this begs the question, is there a consensus on whether CO2 affects global temperature?

17
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:11,000
Citizen scientists can't seem to agree. Some say there isn't.

18
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:15,000
Or that we don't know whether there's a consensus or not.

19
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:18,000
Nobody knows what the majority of scientists think.

20
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,000
Well, let me attempt to break the tie.

21
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:24,000
We don't know if there's a consensus on any scientific theory.

22
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,000
Of course, if you feel the need to put a number on it,

23
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:31,000
you could quite easily count the number of papers consistent with a certain theory,

24
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:34,000
or the impact factors of the journals in which they're published,

25
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,000
or the number of times they've been cited,

26
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:40,000
or count up the position statements of scientific organisations.

27
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:45,000
No one ever takes a vote to see how many scientists support any theory,

28
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:50,000
whether it's climate change, evolution, or even whether the Earth orbits the Sun.

29
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:55,000
So, if scientists never get to vote on them, how do we know that these theories are correct?

30
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:59,000
And why do they end up being taught in schools and universities?

31
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:04,000
To explain how this works, let's take a look at the theory of plate tectonics as an example.

32
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:08,000
The theory didn't develop overnight because geologists voted for it.

33
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:13,000
It started with evidence showing continuity of fossils and rock types between continents.

34
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:16,000
And, of course, early on there were a lot of flaws in the theory,

35
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:20,000
and other hypotheses that explained the evidence that had been found.

36
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:23,000
Then came the discovery of magnetic alignment in rocks,

37
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:26,000
and oceanographers discovered magnetic striping.

38
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:30,000
Each step, each discovery, and each conclusion was written down

39
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:33,000
and published in peer-reviewed papers,

40
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:36,000
where the evidence could be checked and challenged or confirmed.

41
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:39,000
As more and more evidence supported the hypothesis,

42
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:44,000
fewer flaws were found, and therefore fewer rebuttal papers could find fault with it.

43
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:48,000
The hypothesis became a theory not because everyone voted for it,

44
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:52,000
but because the amount of evidence became so overwhelming that in the end

45
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:55,000
no one could find any serious flaws.

46
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:58,000
And no other hypothesis could explain the evidence.

47
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:02,000
Every scientific theory goes through exactly the same process.

48
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:06,000
Of course, there are always a few researchers who have a pet hypothesis

49
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:11,000
that they stick to even if they can't produce any evidence to support it.

50
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:16,000
What matters is not what these contrarians assert in blogs and TV interviews.

51
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:22,000
What matters is the evidence they publish in scientific papers supporting those assertions.

52
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:25,000
And if they don't have any evidence to publish,

53
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:29,000
then railing against a hypothesis may sway public opinion,

54
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:32,000
but it cuts no ice in the world of science.

55
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:38,000
Quoting what experts say in television interviews or blogs or even congressional inquiries

56
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:41,000
is called an argument from authority.

57
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:45,000
That's why I always check to see whether any public statement

58
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:50,000
is supported by a peer-reviewed paper published in a respected scientific journal.

59
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:53,000
And if it is, then I quote that.

60
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:58,000
The problem for contrarians is that most scientific theories are so well supported

61
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:01,000
that it's hard to find any scientists who still disagree with them.

62
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:06,000
So people from outside have to be trucked in and their credentials puffed up.

63
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:13,000
Here, for example, are some familiar activists who don't accept that CO2 is the long-term driver of climate,

64
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:16,000
along with the phony titles they've been given.

65
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:19,000
And here are their real fields of expertise.

66
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:21,000
Does that matter?

67
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:27,000
No, as long as their statements are backed by evidence they've published in peer-reviewed papers.

68
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:29,000
But they're not.

69
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:33,000
So quoting these guys is not only an argument from authority, it's worse.

70
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:36,000
It's an argument from a phony authority.

71
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:41,000
Of course, the methods used to attack paleoclimatology are exactly the same

72
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:44,000
as the methods used to attack paleontology.

73
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:49,000
Turn someone into an authority, and then argue from that phony authority.

74
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:53,000
Professor and science researcher Ian Juby.

75
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:58,000
If Ian Juby has evidence that a particular type of dinosaur laid its eggs in a different manner,

76
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:05,000
all he has to do is write a scientific paper on this astonishing discovery and submit it for publication.

77
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:11,000
If we look at climate through the geological timeframe, we would never suspect CO2 as a major climate driver.

78
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:16,000
And instead of going on television and telling us CO2 is not a long-term driver of climate change,

79
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:23,000
why doesn't Ian Clark submit a response paper to all those researchers who've shown that it clearly is?

80
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:27,000
After all, he's written hundreds of papers in his own field, which is geochemistry,

81
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:32,000
but for some reason, not one single paper related to the effects of CO2 on temperature.

82
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:38,000
He can say whatever he likes on television, but again, that cuts no ice with science.

83
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:43,000
And when I pointed out Bob Carter's lack of research in my video Meet the Scientists,

84
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:46,000
I got this comment from Easy S on the forum.

85
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:52,000
Pottola54, are you even aware of what someone who studies stratigraphic sequences does?

86
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:58,000
Well, I know it's hard to believe, but I did actually go through three years of stratigraphy lectures when I studied geology.

87
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:03,000
I admit I was asleep during half of them and hungover during the other half,

88
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:06,000
but I did manage to pass my stratigraphy exam at the end of it.

89
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:10,000
So I guess I do have an inkling of what a stratigrapher does.

90
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:13,000
And it's not the same as paleoclimatology.

91
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:18,000
Also, lots of the underpinning data that goes into paleoclimatology studies comes from the past climate expressed through stratigraphy.

92
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:24,000
Yes, it does. And in fact, we can see how Carter's work is important for paleoclimatology.

93
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:30,000
I took one of the few papers I could find of his that related to past climate and checked the citations.

94
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:35,000
It was cited by this paper. In other words, it was used, along with a lot of other research papers,

95
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:39,000
to help build up a picture of the Pliocene climate.

96
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:45,000
And that research paper was cited by this paper, which was then cited by this paper,

97
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:51,000
which was cited by this paper, showing a link between glaciation in Greenland during the late Pliocene

98
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:54,000
and a decline in atmospheric carbon dioxide.

99
00:06:54,000 --> 00:07:01,000
So EZS is right. Carter's work does indeed underpin data that goes into paleoclimatology studies.

100
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:07,000
But unfortunately, it supports the correlation between CO2 and global temperature.

101
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:13,000
If Carter disagrees, why hasn't he published a paper detailing the reasons for his disagreement?

102
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:20,000
Of course, the answer is that writing a scientific paper isn't the same as writing an op-ed piece in the Daily Telegraph.

103
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:26,000
You can't just write, I'm one of the world's top paleoclimatologists, and I say global warming stopped. So there.

104
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:32,000
In a proper science paper, you have to explain what evidence you have that global warming stopped.

105
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:35,000
And that's something Carter can't do.

106
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:40,000
The other problem with publishing in a respected scientific journal is that your work is fact-checked.

107
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:46,000
So while you can get away with describing yourself as one of the world's top paleoclimatologists in a book,

108
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:51,000
you can't get away with it in a scientific paper just to make you seem more important.

109
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:55,000
Of course, if you don't name your expert, you can give him any credentials you like.

110
00:07:55,000 --> 00:08:00,000
You can even pretend he has a publishing history without fear that anyone will be able to check.

111
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:06,000
The governor's source has led June Sarpong to a small town on the outskirts of civilization.

112
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:12,000
It's here that a global warming critic says he's hiding for his life.

113
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:19,000
I admit, I'm worried. Once I get to the other side, I'm going to be out of cell phone range.

114
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:24,000
I don't know if anyone's following me or what to expect.

115
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:28,000
She finds a man who does not want to be seen or named.

116
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:36,000
A climate scientist who's been at the top of his field since the 1970s when the concern was global cooling.

117
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:40,000
Can you tell us why you're in silhouette today for this interview?

118
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:44,000
Well, because of the attacks on me personally.

119
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:48,000
Now I've got no idea who this mystery climatologist is.

120
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:53,000
One person we know it definitely isn't is Professor Tim Ball.

121
00:08:53,000 --> 00:09:01,000
After all, the climatologist in hiding is described as a climate scientist who's been at the top of his field since the 1970s.

122
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:04,000
And we know that Tim Ball is a retired geography professor.

123
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:10,000
He didn't study climatology until the 1980s and his only contribution to climatology research

124
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:15,000
was three papers looking at the historical weather records of the Hudson's Bay Company,

125
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:17,000
all of them now around 30 years old.

126
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:19,000
So what do you think is causing global warming?

127
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:22,000
The sun. There's absolutely no question.

128
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:29,000
The sun is virtually ignored by the authorities and particularly the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change.

129
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:34,000
Well, now we definitely know it's not Tim Ball because Tim Ball doesn't sound anything like that.

130
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:37,000
They virtually ignore the sun as a factor of climate change.

131
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:46,000
Well, that's funny. Excuse me a second. Tim? Hello? Tim? Is that you? I can see you.

132
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:55,000
Yes, it is you, Tim. Now, I'm sure conspiracy theorists tell me I'm endangering Tim Ball's life by exposing the identity of the mystery shadow man.

133
00:09:55,000 --> 00:10:02,000
Well, if Ball really was in fear of his life, it's odd that he's appeared on television programmes and given public speeches

134
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:09,000
and plastered his photo on website blogs many times since the conspiracy show was broadcast in 2009.

135
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:12,000
He doesn't seem that concerned.

136
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:16,000
Can you tell us why you're in silhouette today for this interview?

137
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:19,000
Well, that's a very good question, June.

138
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:24,000
Could it be that your producers didn't think the conspiracy show would be much of a conspiracy show

139
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:28,000
if it didn't have people hiding in the darkness because of a conspiracy against them

140
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:35,000
and interviewers being scared that they're followed to the outskirts of civilisation, in other words, Canada, where Tim Ball lives?

141
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:39,000
Could it be that disguising him means that we have to take your word that we're listening to

142
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:43,000
a climate scientist who's been at the top of his field since the 1970s

143
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:49,000
rather than a retired geography professor who's never published any papers in the field he's pontificating about?

144
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:51,000
Could that be the reason?

145
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:56,000
Sounds like a familiar tactic from those whose beliefs clash with scientific conclusions.

146
00:10:56,000 --> 00:11:03,000
I'm having the pleasure of sitting down with a geophysicist that unfortunately has to remain anonymous.

147
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:04,000
So, can I call you Steve?

148
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:05,000
My name's Gladys.

149
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:10,000
Alright, so Steve is going to share with us… no, just Steve, let me ask you as a geophysicist…

150
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:15,000
Still, Tim Ball is one of the few climate activists who's actually studied climatology,

151
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:20,000
and that prompted this post from Straight Forever on my Meet the Scientist video forum.

152
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:27,000
I study geography, and within the geography department where I study, there are people there who study different fields within geography,

153
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:29,000
climatology being one of them.

154
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:34,000
This person is therefore a climatologist and not a geography lecturer-professor.

155
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:42,000
Sorry to disagree back, but Tim Ball was a geography professor and even describes himself as a geography professor

156
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:46,000
when he's writing to people who can separate academic truth from bullshit.

157
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:55,000
He only describes himself as a climatology professor when he's trying to impress politicians and members of the public who don't know any better.

158
00:11:55,000 --> 00:12:00,000
As I showed in the video, there is no department of climatology at the University of Winnipeg,

159
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:07,000
but even if you still want to insist he's an expert on climatology, the same rule applies to all the other experts,

160
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:13,000
they can't just make pronouncements on TV and tell us we have to believe them because they're experts,

161
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:19,000
they have to publish their evidence so that other scientists can test it and check it and challenge it.

162
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:21,000
Ball hasn't.

163
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:28,000
And if you still want to insist he's an expert, then let's test that by seeing how much he actually knows.

164
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:31,000
We'll start with this.

165
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:36,000
I started in 1968 and at that time global cooling was the consensus.

166
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:41,000
Now there are people out there that have tried to say, oh it wasn't the consensus, well I can tell you it was.

167
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:46,000
I was not only in it, I was teaching it and researching it as well.

168
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:48,000
Hang on a second, what date was that?

169
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:49,000
In 1968.

170
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:58,000
1968? But according to your own bio, you weren't teaching it, you were a search and rescue operations officer at that time,

171
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:03,000
and you didn't do your doctorate in climatology until the 1980s.

172
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:10,000
So what evidence do you have that there was a consensus on global cooling except for a faulty memory?

173
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:16,000
If Ball had taken the time to read papers that predicted future temperature trends in the 1960s and 70s,

174
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:21,000
he'd find that 44 predicted warming and 7 predicted cooling.

175
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:26,000
Ball also seems to be confused about what his supposed area of expertise is called.

176
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:33,000
They started with global warming and then when they realised that the global temperature was going down since 2000,

177
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:38,000
even though CO2 continued to rise, and they started talking about climate change.

178
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:43,000
Which makes me wonder whether he's read any climate science papers in the last 25 years.

179
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:48,000
Not only was this phenomenon called climatic change as far back as the 1950s,

180
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:56,000
we even have something called the IPCC, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, set up in the 1980s.

181
00:13:56,000 --> 00:14:03,000
Global warming is a colloquial term meaning exactly what it says, the overall warming of the earth.

182
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:08,000
Climate change is the change in climate that results from that warming.

183
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:10,000
And then we come to this.

184
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:14,000
For example, they virtually ignore the sun as a factor of climate change.

185
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:18,000
Now anyone who reads scientific journals that deal with climate science

186
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:23,000
will be well aware of the huge amount of research that's gone into the role of the sun in warming.

187
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:27,000
Even I've read these papers, Tim, and I'm not a climate scientist.

188
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:33,000
What goes for Tim Ball goes for every other phony expert who eschews scientific research

189
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:38,000
in favour of TV interviews, newspaper opinion and amateur dramatics.

190
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:46,000
If there really were hundreds of climate scientists who disagree that CO2 is a long-term driver of climate, where are they?

191
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:50,000
How come TV programmes and congressional inquiries can't find them

192
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:55,000
and have to resort to using people who've never published any research in this field

193
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:58,000
and then make up phony titles for them?

194
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:00,000
And more to the point, where are their papers?

195
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:06,000
Even the busiest armchair scientists who deluge my channel with links can't find them.

196
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:10,000
So thanks for all the links to blogs, videos and data.

197
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:14,000
And the occasional scientific paper showing facts that no-one is disputing.

198
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:19,000
And thanks for letting me know that there are unknowns in climatology and biology

199
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:22,000
just as there are unknowns in any scientific field.

200
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:24,000
That's why we do research.

201
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:27,000
Was the medieval warm period global?

202
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:30,000
Is atmospheric heat being taken up in the deep oceans?

203
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:33,000
What's the contribution of epigenetics to evolution?

204
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:35,000
How did giraffes evolve?

205
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:37,000
Why are there hotspots in the mantle?

206
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:42,000
What's the relationship between currents in the mantle and continental drift?

207
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:48,000
Those who want to undermine scientific theories love to focus on the questions and the unknowns

208
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:53,000
to imply that if we don't know some things, then we can't know anything.

209
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:57,000
But they never tackle the evidence that gave us these theories in the first place

210
00:15:57,000 --> 00:16:00,000
because that evidence is as solid as it gets.

211
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:05,000
If you're interested in having a go, I've outlined the evidence for the CO2 temperature link

212
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:10,000
in my video The Evidence for Climate Change without Computer Models or the IPCC.

213
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:15,000
And I've outlined the evidence for evolution in my videos Natural Selection Made Easy

214
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:18,000
and The Theory of Evolution Made Easy.

215
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:22,000
So check the papers I cite and see if you can find response papers

216
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:27,000
or any papers published in respected scientific journals that find fault with them.

217
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:35,000
Simply listing names and appealing to authority, let alone a phony authority, is not how science is done.

218
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:40,000
Before Galileo came along, this kind of argument from authority might have worked.

219
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:45,000
But thanks to him and other pioneers of science, we've learnt that what counts is not dogma

220
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:50,000
or the assertions of experts or the assertions of people who pretend to be experts.

221
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:54,000
What matters is evidence that's peer-reviewed and published

222
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:58,000
so it can be examined, tested, replicated, fact-checked and faulted.

223
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:02,000
That, after all, is what Galileo would do.

224
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:07,000
It's the nearest thing we have to knowing what the consensus is in science.
