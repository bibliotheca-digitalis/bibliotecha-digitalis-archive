00:00.000 --> 00:04.000
And for that, the Australian government wants to bring the economy to its knees.

00:04.000 --> 00:06.000
Say no to the carbon tax.

00:06.000 --> 00:10.000
This message is brought to you by the Galileo movement.

00:10.000 --> 00:14.000
No, this isn't a video about the carbon tax.

00:14.000 --> 00:18.000
Whether you're for it or against it is your business, not mine.

00:18.000 --> 00:22.000
What I'm interested in is this thing called the Galileo movement.

00:22.000 --> 00:26.000
Whenever a particular group wants to challenge established science,

00:26.000 --> 00:32.000
they like to compare themselves to Galileo, a lone voice crying out against the scientific consensus.

00:32.000 --> 00:38.000
Trouble is, Galileo wasn't challenging the scientific consensus of the 17th century.

00:38.000 --> 00:42.000
He was the scientific consensus of the 17th century,

00:42.000 --> 00:45.000
which is why he's called the father of modern science.

00:45.000 --> 00:49.000
What he was challenging was belief and dogma,

00:49.000 --> 00:53.000
and the idea that just because authorities like the Pope or Aristotle

00:53.000 --> 00:57.000
believes something to be true, that doesn't make it true.

00:57.000 --> 01:02.000
What counts is evidence derived by the scientific method.

01:02.000 --> 01:07.000
But this begs the question, is there a consensus on whether CO2 affects global temperature?

01:07.000 --> 01:11.000
Citizen scientists can't seem to agree. Some say there isn't.

01:11.000 --> 01:15.000
Or that we don't know whether there's a consensus or not.

01:15.000 --> 01:18.000
Nobody knows what the majority of scientists think.

01:18.000 --> 01:20.000
Well, let me attempt to break the tie.

01:20.000 --> 01:24.000
We don't know if there's a consensus on any scientific theory.

01:24.000 --> 01:26.000
Of course, if you feel the need to put a number on it,

01:26.000 --> 01:31.000
you could quite easily count the number of papers consistent with a certain theory,

01:31.000 --> 01:34.000
or the impact factors of the journals in which they're published,

01:34.000 --> 01:36.000
or the number of times they've been cited,

01:36.000 --> 01:40.000
or count up the position statements of scientific organisations.

01:40.000 --> 01:45.000
No one ever takes a vote to see how many scientists support any theory,

01:45.000 --> 01:50.000
whether it's climate change, evolution, or even whether the Earth orbits the Sun.

01:50.000 --> 01:55.000
So, if scientists never get to vote on them, how do we know that these theories are correct?

01:55.000 --> 01:59.000
And why do they end up being taught in schools and universities?

01:59.000 --> 02:04.000
To explain how this works, let's take a look at the theory of plate tectonics as an example.

02:04.000 --> 02:08.000
The theory didn't develop overnight because geologists voted for it.

02:08.000 --> 02:13.000
It started with evidence showing continuity of fossils and rock types between continents.

02:13.000 --> 02:16.000
And, of course, early on there were a lot of flaws in the theory,

02:16.000 --> 02:20.000
and other hypotheses that explained the evidence that had been found.

02:20.000 --> 02:23.000
Then came the discovery of magnetic alignment in rocks,

02:23.000 --> 02:26.000
and oceanographers discovered magnetic striping.

02:26.000 --> 02:30.000
Each step, each discovery, and each conclusion was written down

02:30.000 --> 02:33.000
and published in peer-reviewed papers,

02:33.000 --> 02:36.000
where the evidence could be checked and challenged or confirmed.

02:36.000 --> 02:39.000
As more and more evidence supported the hypothesis,

02:39.000 --> 02:44.000
fewer flaws were found, and therefore fewer rebuttal papers could find fault with it.

02:44.000 --> 02:48.000
The hypothesis became a theory not because everyone voted for it,

02:48.000 --> 02:52.000
but because the amount of evidence became so overwhelming that in the end

02:52.000 --> 02:55.000
no one could find any serious flaws.

02:55.000 --> 02:58.000
And no other hypothesis could explain the evidence.

02:58.000 --> 03:02.000
Every scientific theory goes through exactly the same process.

03:02.000 --> 03:06.000
Of course, there are always a few researchers who have a pet hypothesis

03:07.000 --> 03:11.000
that they stick to even if they can't produce any evidence to support it.

03:11.000 --> 03:16.000
What matters is not what these contrarians assert in blogs and TV interviews.

03:16.000 --> 03:22.000
What matters is the evidence they publish in scientific papers supporting those assertions.

03:22.000 --> 03:25.000
And if they don't have any evidence to publish,

03:25.000 --> 03:29.000
then railing against a hypothesis may sway public opinion,

03:29.000 --> 03:32.000
but it cuts no ice in the world of science.

03:33.000 --> 03:38.000
Quoting what experts say in television interviews or blogs or even congressional inquiries

03:38.000 --> 03:41.000
is called an argument from authority.

03:41.000 --> 03:45.000
That's why I always check to see whether any public statement

03:45.000 --> 03:50.000
is supported by a peer-reviewed paper published in a respected scientific journal.

03:50.000 --> 03:53.000
And if it is, then I quote that.

03:53.000 --> 03:58.000
The problem for contrarians is that most scientific theories are so well supported

03:58.000 --> 04:01.000
that it's hard to find any scientists who still disagree with them.

04:01.000 --> 04:06.000
So people from outside have to be trucked in and their credentials puffed up.

04:06.000 --> 04:13.000
Here, for example, are some familiar activists who don't accept that CO2 is the long-term driver of climate,

04:13.000 --> 04:16.000
along with the phony titles they've been given.

04:16.000 --> 04:19.000
And here are their real fields of expertise.

04:19.000 --> 04:21.000
Does that matter?

04:21.000 --> 04:27.000
No, as long as their statements are backed by evidence they've published in peer-reviewed papers.

04:27.000 --> 04:29.000
But they're not.

04:29.000 --> 04:33.000
So quoting these guys is not only an argument from authority, it's worse.

04:33.000 --> 04:36.000
It's an argument from a phony authority.

04:36.000 --> 04:41.000
Of course, the methods used to attack paleoclimatology are exactly the same

04:41.000 --> 04:44.000
as the methods used to attack paleontology.

04:44.000 --> 04:49.000
Turn someone into an authority, and then argue from that phony authority.

04:49.000 --> 04:53.000
Professor and science researcher Ian Juby.

04:53.000 --> 04:58.000
If Ian Juby has evidence that a particular type of dinosaur laid its eggs in a different manner,

04:58.000 --> 05:05.000
all he has to do is write a scientific paper on this astonishing discovery and submit it for publication.

05:05.000 --> 05:11.000
If we look at climate through the geological timeframe, we would never suspect CO2 as a major climate driver.

05:11.000 --> 05:16.000
And instead of going on television and telling us CO2 is not a long-term driver of climate change,

05:16.000 --> 05:23.000
why doesn't Ian Clark submit a response paper to all those researchers who've shown that it clearly is?

05:23.000 --> 05:27.000
After all, he's written hundreds of papers in his own field, which is geochemistry,

05:27.000 --> 05:32.000
but for some reason, not one single paper related to the effects of CO2 on temperature.

05:32.000 --> 05:38.000
He can say whatever he likes on television, but again, that cuts no ice with science.

05:38.000 --> 05:43.000
And when I pointed out Bob Carter's lack of research in my video Meet the Scientists,

05:43.000 --> 05:46.000
I got this comment from Easy S on the forum.

05:46.000 --> 05:52.000
Pottola54, are you even aware of what someone who studies stratigraphic sequences does?

05:52.000 --> 05:58.000
Well, I know it's hard to believe, but I did actually go through three years of stratigraphy lectures when I studied geology.

05:58.000 --> 06:03.000
I admit I was asleep during half of them and hungover during the other half,

06:03.000 --> 06:06.000
but I did manage to pass my stratigraphy exam at the end of it.

06:06.000 --> 06:10.000
So I guess I do have an inkling of what a stratigrapher does.

06:10.000 --> 06:13.000
And it's not the same as paleoclimatology.

06:13.000 --> 06:18.000
Also, lots of the underpinning data that goes into paleoclimatology studies comes from the past climate expressed through stratigraphy.

06:18.000 --> 06:24.000
Yes, it does. And in fact, we can see how Carter's work is important for paleoclimatology.

06:24.000 --> 06:30.000
I took one of the few papers I could find of his that related to past climate and checked the citations.

06:30.000 --> 06:35.000
It was cited by this paper. In other words, it was used, along with a lot of other research papers,

06:35.000 --> 06:39.000
to help build up a picture of the Pliocene climate.

06:39.000 --> 06:45.000
And that research paper was cited by this paper, which was then cited by this paper,

06:45.000 --> 06:51.000
which was cited by this paper, showing a link between glaciation in Greenland during the late Pliocene

06:51.000 --> 06:54.000
and a decline in atmospheric carbon dioxide.

06:54.000 --> 07:01.000
So EZS is right. Carter's work does indeed underpin data that goes into paleoclimatology studies.

07:01.000 --> 07:07.000
But unfortunately, it supports the correlation between CO2 and global temperature.

07:07.000 --> 07:13.000
If Carter disagrees, why hasn't he published a paper detailing the reasons for his disagreement?

07:13.000 --> 07:20.000
Of course, the answer is that writing a scientific paper isn't the same as writing an op-ed piece in the Daily Telegraph.

07:20.000 --> 07:26.000
You can't just write, I'm one of the world's top paleoclimatologists, and I say global warming stopped. So there.

07:26.000 --> 07:32.000
In a proper science paper, you have to explain what evidence you have that global warming stopped.

07:32.000 --> 07:35.000
And that's something Carter can't do.

07:35.000 --> 07:40.000
The other problem with publishing in a respected scientific journal is that your work is fact-checked.

07:40.000 --> 07:46.000
So while you can get away with describing yourself as one of the world's top paleoclimatologists in a book,

07:46.000 --> 07:51.000
you can't get away with it in a scientific paper just to make you seem more important.

07:51.000 --> 07:55.000
Of course, if you don't name your expert, you can give him any credentials you like.

07:55.000 --> 08:00.000
You can even pretend he has a publishing history without fear that anyone will be able to check.

08:00.000 --> 08:06.000
The governor's source has led June Sarpong to a small town on the outskirts of civilization.

08:06.000 --> 08:12.000
It's here that a global warming critic says he's hiding for his life.

08:12.000 --> 08:19.000
I admit, I'm worried. Once I get to the other side, I'm going to be out of cell phone range.

08:19.000 --> 08:24.000
I don't know if anyone's following me or what to expect.

08:24.000 --> 08:28.000
She finds a man who does not want to be seen or named.

08:28.000 --> 08:36.000
A climate scientist who's been at the top of his field since the 1970s when the concern was global cooling.

08:36.000 --> 08:40.000
Can you tell us why you're in silhouette today for this interview?

08:40.000 --> 08:44.000
Well, because of the attacks on me personally.

08:44.000 --> 08:48.000
Now I've got no idea who this mystery climatologist is.

08:48.000 --> 08:53.000
One person we know it definitely isn't is Professor Tim Ball.

08:53.000 --> 09:01.000
After all, the climatologist in hiding is described as a climate scientist who's been at the top of his field since the 1970s.

09:01.000 --> 09:04.000
And we know that Tim Ball is a retired geography professor.

09:04.000 --> 09:10.000
He didn't study climatology until the 1980s and his only contribution to climatology research

09:10.000 --> 09:15.000
was three papers looking at the historical weather records of the Hudson's Bay Company,

09:15.000 --> 09:17.000
all of them now around 30 years old.

09:17.000 --> 09:19.000
So what do you think is causing global warming?

09:19.000 --> 09:22.000
The sun. There's absolutely no question.

09:22.000 --> 09:29.000
The sun is virtually ignored by the authorities and particularly the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change.

09:29.000 --> 09:34.000
Well, now we definitely know it's not Tim Ball because Tim Ball doesn't sound anything like that.

09:34.000 --> 09:37.000
They virtually ignore the sun as a factor of climate change.

09:37.000 --> 09:46.000
Well, that's funny. Excuse me a second. Tim? Hello? Tim? Is that you? I can see you.

09:46.000 --> 09:55.000
Yes, it is you, Tim. Now, I'm sure conspiracy theorists tell me I'm endangering Tim Ball's life by exposing the identity of the mystery shadow man.

09:55.000 --> 10:02.000
Well, if Ball really was in fear of his life, it's odd that he's appeared on television programmes and given public speeches

10:02.000 --> 10:09.000
and plastered his photo on website blogs many times since the conspiracy show was broadcast in 2009.

10:09.000 --> 10:12.000
He doesn't seem that concerned.

10:12.000 --> 10:16.000
Can you tell us why you're in silhouette today for this interview?

10:16.000 --> 10:19.000
Well, that's a very good question, June.

10:19.000 --> 10:24.000
Could it be that your producers didn't think the conspiracy show would be much of a conspiracy show

10:24.000 --> 10:28.000
if it didn't have people hiding in the darkness because of a conspiracy against them

10:28.000 --> 10:35.000
and interviewers being scared that they're followed to the outskirts of civilisation, in other words, Canada, where Tim Ball lives?

10:35.000 --> 10:39.000
Could it be that disguising him means that we have to take your word that we're listening to

10:39.000 --> 10:43.000
a climate scientist who's been at the top of his field since the 1970s

10:43.000 --> 10:49.000
rather than a retired geography professor who's never published any papers in the field he's pontificating about?

10:49.000 --> 10:51.000
Could that be the reason?

10:51.000 --> 10:56.000
Sounds like a familiar tactic from those whose beliefs clash with scientific conclusions.

10:56.000 --> 11:03.000
I'm having the pleasure of sitting down with a geophysicist that unfortunately has to remain anonymous.

11:03.000 --> 11:04.000
So, can I call you Steve?

11:04.000 --> 11:05.000
My name's Gladys.

11:05.000 --> 11:10.000
Alright, so Steve is going to share with us… no, just Steve, let me ask you as a geophysicist…

11:10.000 --> 11:15.000
Still, Tim Ball is one of the few climate activists who's actually studied climatology,

11:15.000 --> 11:20.000
and that prompted this post from Straight Forever on my Meet the Scientist video forum.

11:20.000 --> 11:27.000
I study geography, and within the geography department where I study, there are people there who study different fields within geography,

11:27.000 --> 11:29.000
climatology being one of them.

11:29.000 --> 11:34.000
This person is therefore a climatologist and not a geography lecturer-professor.

11:34.000 --> 11:42.000
Sorry to disagree back, but Tim Ball was a geography professor and even describes himself as a geography professor

11:42.000 --> 11:46.000
when he's writing to people who can separate academic truth from bullshit.

11:46.000 --> 11:55.000
He only describes himself as a climatology professor when he's trying to impress politicians and members of the public who don't know any better.

11:55.000 --> 12:00.000
As I showed in the video, there is no department of climatology at the University of Winnipeg,

12:00.000 --> 12:07.000
but even if you still want to insist he's an expert on climatology, the same rule applies to all the other experts,

12:07.000 --> 12:13.000
they can't just make pronouncements on TV and tell us we have to believe them because they're experts,

12:13.000 --> 12:19.000
they have to publish their evidence so that other scientists can test it and check it and challenge it.

12:19.000 --> 12:21.000
Ball hasn't.

12:21.000 --> 12:28.000
And if you still want to insist he's an expert, then let's test that by seeing how much he actually knows.

12:30.000 --> 12:31.000
We'll start with this.

12:31.000 --> 12:36.000
I started in 1968 and at that time global cooling was the consensus.

12:36.000 --> 12:41.000
Now there are people out there that have tried to say, oh it wasn't the consensus, well I can tell you it was.

12:41.000 --> 12:46.000
I was not only in it, I was teaching it and researching it as well.

12:46.000 --> 12:48.000
Hang on a second, what date was that?

12:48.000 --> 12:49.000
In 1968.

12:49.000 --> 12:58.000
1968? But according to your own bio, you weren't teaching it, you were a search and rescue operations officer at that time,

12:58.000 --> 13:03.000
and you didn't do your doctorate in climatology until the 1980s.

13:03.000 --> 13:10.000
So what evidence do you have that there was a consensus on global cooling except for a faulty memory?

13:10.000 --> 13:16.000
If Ball had taken the time to read papers that predicted future temperature trends in the 1960s and 70s,

13:16.000 --> 13:21.000
he'd find that 44 predicted warming and 7 predicted cooling.

13:21.000 --> 13:26.000
Ball also seems to be confused about what his supposed area of expertise is called.

13:26.000 --> 13:33.000
They started with global warming and then when they realised that the global temperature was going down since 2000,

13:33.000 --> 13:38.000
even though CO2 continued to rise, and they started talking about climate change.

13:38.000 --> 13:43.000
Which makes me wonder whether he's read any climate science papers in the last 25 years.

13:43.000 --> 13:48.000
Not only was this phenomenon called climatic change as far back as the 1950s,

13:48.000 --> 13:56.000
we even have something called the IPCC, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, set up in the 1980s.

13:56.000 --> 14:03.000
Global warming is a colloquial term meaning exactly what it says, the overall warming of the earth.

14:03.000 --> 14:08.000
Climate change is the change in climate that results from that warming.

14:08.000 --> 14:10.000
And then we come to this.

14:10.000 --> 14:14.000
For example, they virtually ignore the sun as a factor of climate change.

14:14.000 --> 14:18.000
Now anyone who reads scientific journals that deal with climate science

14:18.000 --> 14:23.000
will be well aware of the huge amount of research that's gone into the role of the sun in warming.

14:23.000 --> 14:27.000
Even I've read these papers, Tim, and I'm not a climate scientist.

14:27.000 --> 14:33.000
What goes for Tim Ball goes for every other phony expert who eschews scientific research

14:33.000 --> 14:38.000
in favour of TV interviews, newspaper opinion and amateur dramatics.

14:38.000 --> 14:46.000
If there really were hundreds of climate scientists who disagree that CO2 is a long-term driver of climate, where are they?

14:46.000 --> 14:50.000
How come TV programmes and congressional inquiries can't find them

14:50.000 --> 14:55.000
and have to resort to using people who've never published any research in this field

14:55.000 --> 14:58.000
and then make up phony titles for them?

14:58.000 --> 15:00.000
And more to the point, where are their papers?

15:00.000 --> 15:06.000
Even the busiest armchair scientists who deluge my channel with links can't find them.

15:06.000 --> 15:10.000
So thanks for all the links to blogs, videos and data.

15:10.000 --> 15:14.000
And the occasional scientific paper showing facts that no-one is disputing.

15:14.000 --> 15:19.000
And thanks for letting me know that there are unknowns in climatology and biology

15:19.000 --> 15:22.000
just as there are unknowns in any scientific field.

15:22.000 --> 15:24.000
That's why we do research.

15:24.000 --> 15:27.000
Was the medieval warm period global?

15:27.000 --> 15:30.000
Is atmospheric heat being taken up in the deep oceans?

15:30.000 --> 15:33.000
What's the contribution of epigenetics to evolution?

15:33.000 --> 15:35.000
How did giraffes evolve?

15:35.000 --> 15:37.000
Why are there hotspots in the mantle?

15:37.000 --> 15:42.000
What's the relationship between currents in the mantle and continental drift?

15:42.000 --> 15:48.000
Those who want to undermine scientific theories love to focus on the questions and the unknowns

15:48.000 --> 15:53.000
to imply that if we don't know some things, then we can't know anything.

15:53.000 --> 15:57.000
But they never tackle the evidence that gave us these theories in the first place

15:57.000 --> 16:00.000
because that evidence is as solid as it gets.

16:00.000 --> 16:05.000
If you're interested in having a go, I've outlined the evidence for the CO2 temperature link

16:05.000 --> 16:10.000
in my video The Evidence for Climate Change without Computer Models or the IPCC.

16:10.000 --> 16:15.000
And I've outlined the evidence for evolution in my videos Natural Selection Made Easy

16:15.000 --> 16:18.000
and The Theory of Evolution Made Easy.

16:18.000 --> 16:22.000
So check the papers I cite and see if you can find response papers

16:22.000 --> 16:27.000
or any papers published in respected scientific journals that find fault with them.

16:27.000 --> 16:35.000
Simply listing names and appealing to authority, let alone a phony authority, is not how science is done.

16:35.000 --> 16:40.000
Before Galileo came along, this kind of argument from authority might have worked.

16:40.000 --> 16:45.000
But thanks to him and other pioneers of science, we've learnt that what counts is not dogma

16:45.000 --> 16:50.000
or the assertions of experts or the assertions of people who pretend to be experts.

16:50.000 --> 16:54.000
What matters is evidence that's peer-reviewed and published

16:54.000 --> 16:58.000
so it can be examined, tested, replicated, fact-checked and faulted.

16:58.000 --> 17:02.000
That, after all, is what Galileo would do.

17:02.000 --> 17:07.000
It's the nearest thing we have to knowing what the consensus is in science.
