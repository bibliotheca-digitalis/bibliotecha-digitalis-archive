0	5240	Here's a little murder mystery. One morning police find the body of a murdered woman,
5240	10960	her head bashed in by a clock. Its hands rest at ten o'clock. Her broken watch shows the
10960	16260	same time. A doctor arrives and estimates the time of death based on body temperature
16260	21360	at between nine forty five and ten fifteen the previous evening. Phone records show the
21360	27460	woman made an emergency call at nine fifty seven, but the line was then cut. So here's
27460	33200	the question. What time was the woman killed? It's possible of course that one of these
33200	38220	pieces of evidence is wrong. The phone company's records may be wrong. The clock may have been
38220	44940	slow or fast or broken on another occasion. So it's very remotely possible that all the
44940	51140	evidence is wrong. So what makes us confident that each piece of evidence is right? It's
51140	56780	the fact that they all point to the same time. If each piece of evidence was wrong then the
56820	61060	times they point to would be all over the place. The fact that they all point to the
61060	68060	same time is called consistency. Consistency is what turns an observation into evidence
68460	73820	and we all use it all the time to make deductions about what happened in the past. In the story
73820	79240	of The Earth Made Easy I showed four photographs and asked people to deduce which was the earthquake,
79240	83860	the tornado, the hurricane and the flood. I asked a lot of creationists to take the
83860	88340	test but they were either vague about their results or refused to tell me whether they
88340	93340	got the right answer and how they derived it. I suppose an admission that we can work
93340	98580	this out is an admission that we can work out what happened in the past. But it doesn't
98580	103840	matter, I know they got the right answer and we all know how they derived it. They looked
103840	110200	for the same things any rational person looks for, consistency. If people living in this
110200	116400	town told you this damage was caused by an earthquake you wouldn't believe it. Why not?
116400	121200	Because the limited extent of the damage is inconsistent with an earthquake, or a flood
121200	126080	or a hurricane come to that. But the single trail of destruction is consistent with the
126080	132800	path of a tornado. And if we look closer we'll discover that brick structures remain undamaged,
132800	136960	also inconsistent with an earthquake, while lighter objects have been strewn all over
136960	143680	the place. Inconsistent with an earthquake, but entirely consistent with a typhoon. So it
143680	149200	really doesn't matter what our eyewitnesses claim. Maybe they were mistaken or maybe they were lying
149200	155240	or maybe they're delusional. Eyewitnesses often get things wrong but the evidence doesn't lie.
155240	161720	We're intelligent enough to work things out for ourselves. Throughout this series which took us
161720	166800	from the beginning of our universe to the human migration out of Africa, through all of this the
166800	172760	evidence has been consistent. All of the millions of pieces of individual evidence that form the
172760	178480	hundreds of theories in dozens of different scientific fields, each and all are consistent
178480	184920	with a single time frame and with each other. So the argument creationists use to suggest how
184920	190920	one piece of evidence might possibly be wrong can't override one unanswerable fact that all
191000	197120	the scientific evidence is consistent. And none of the evidence is even remotely consistent with
197120	204200	the universe, Earth and every living thing in it being instantly created 6,000 years ago. So where
204200	209280	an imaginary God was there to explain all the gaps in our knowledge, as we learn more about how the
209280	215520	world works and how we got here, the role of this deity diminishes until it finds a place beyond the
215520	221600	current extent of our knowledge inside the Big Bang. Cosmologists admit that they don't yet know
221600	226320	what caused the Big Bang. I don't mind people telling me that their religion does have the
226320	231600	answer and that it's the absolute unassailable truth. But if that's the case then let's have
231600	237280	the details. Whatever lurks inside the world of quantum physics and singularity can't be masculine
237280	243920	or feminine. So what is this God thing? What did it do to cause the Big Bang? How did it all happen?
243920	249960	If you don't know then you really don't know much more than I do. The plain fact is that none of us
249960	256240	yet knows so let's stop pretending we do. Sitting around arguing about what we don't know is like
256240	261800	ancient Greeks trying to use philosophy to work out what powers the Sun. But one thing we do know
261800	267280	is that we can't use the Bible or the Quran as evidence because the evidence we can see shows
267280	273000	that these books are erroneous. Whatever it was that caused the Big Bang we know from observations
273080	279880	how the world has unfolded since then. There was no Garden of Eden, no man made out of clay and a
279880	285620	woman made out of a rib. We know this because we can trace our origins very clearly back to Africa
285620	292040	over 100,000 years ago. There was no instant creation of all the animals. We have overwhelming
292040	297240	evidence that animals evolved over hundreds of millions of years. There was no global flood.
297240	302280	We've dug and drilled through miles of rock stretching back billions of years and the
302280	309200	evidence for a worldwide flood 4,000 years ago just is not there. The universe was not made in
309200	315520	a few days. It's nearly 14 billion years old and we can see galaxies so far away that the light from
315520	321080	them takes billions of years to reach us. And since we know all this then we also know that
321080	327680	the deity described in these holy books is a myth. A Bronze Age guess aimed at explaining the yawning
327680	333800	gaps in our knowledge 3,000 years ago. The problem is these books have been believed for so long it's
333800	339320	difficult to wean people off them and that makes for a dangerous world in which Bronze Age myths
339320	345280	hold greater power over some leaders and some nations than rational thought. I'm not just
345280	349880	talking about the obvious dangers of religious intolerance. The world is facing unprecedented
349880	355840	environmental challenges in the 21st century. We can't act under the assumption that a benign
355840	362280	being is watching over us and will make sure we come to no harm. Or worse follow a book that tells
362280	367760	us the ultimate destruction of our environment is the will of some invisible deity and that the best
367760	373760	way to save ourselves is not to try to fix the damage but to pray to the deity. This has been
373760	379760	the futile practice of humans for thousands of years. Natives praying to a volcano god instead
379760	384880	of taking to their canoes. I hope this series has shown why we can't afford to be complacent.
385200	391200	If we assume the fate of our world is sealed and out of our hands then it soon will be.
391200	399040	So what happens now? Well the series of videos that explains the evidence for our origins is
399040	405160	finished. On this channel I'll continue to upload videos explaining scientific concepts and the next
405160	412280	one will be the Ice Age Made Easy. And I've started a new channel Pothola54 Debunks to debunk
412320	418680	creationist junk science and fake claims and also to answer questions. Because I expect a lot of
418680	423840	complaints about the new series and attempts to get the channel blocked I'm keeping it separate
423840	429440	from the Made Easy series on this channel. And finally thank you to all those who've written in
429440	434960	to tell me I'm going to hell. You've probably realized by now that I'm impervious to these
434960	441080	pathetic scare stories. And to those who've asked what if I'm wrong my answer is the same as yours.
441080	446880	What if I tell you that you have to go outside right now and howl at the moon or a monster will
446880	452440	crawl out from under your bed tonight and boil you in acid? You may think that's nonsense but
452440	458840	what if you're wrong? As you can see when it's tried on you it just doesn't work. And to all
458840	463920	those who've asked where I'll go when I die I'm happy to say I'll be in the same place I was in
463920	473640	1947 and 1853 and 1622. I'll be a bunch of atoms spread across the landscape. Is that an awful
473640	479000	picture? A hundred years ago not being alive didn't bother me so I don't suppose it will bother me a
479000	487080	hundred years from now. Let God's pale archangel, the grim reaper come. He can hack my bones, he can
487080	494400	step up on my gravestone, he can kiss my bone, I don't care. Oh and one more thing, I'm delighted to take the
494400	498480	blasphemy challenge and announce that I deny the Holy Spirit.
498480	519280	He was a blacksmith by trade. He used to live on his own. She was a little old maid. She was all
519280	526440	gristlin' bone, just a crone that you might not have fancied yourself. She was not born to attract.
526440	535240	She was lined up for the shelf if it were not for the fact the blacksmith loved her well. He loved her
535240	548160	like hell. He used to grunt and sigh fit to die but from afar for he was shy. As blacksmiths often
548160	557840	learn. She made a meager livelihood from a homemade toffee that she'd sell. Up and down the
557840	566640	neighborhood to a butterscotch and caramel clientele and optimistically she used to think that she'd get
566640	575560	her husband yet. She was far too modest, too wink, too proud to be coquette. You bet cause she'd got
575560	586120	a squint. She was skinny, she was skint. It never seemed that she, so palpably, bizarre but none could
586120	594760	ever be a farmer fatter. Time has no time to spare.
