1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,240
Here's a little murder mystery. One morning police find the body of a murdered woman,

2
00:00:05,240 --> 00:00:10,960
her head bashed in by a clock. Its hands rest at ten o'clock. Her broken watch shows the

3
00:00:10,960 --> 00:00:16,260
same time. A doctor arrives and estimates the time of death based on body temperature

4
00:00:16,260 --> 00:00:21,360
at between nine forty five and ten fifteen the previous evening. Phone records show the

5
00:00:21,360 --> 00:00:27,460
woman made an emergency call at nine fifty seven, but the line was then cut. So here's

6
00:00:27,460 --> 00:00:33,200
the question. What time was the woman killed? It's possible of course that one of these

7
00:00:33,200 --> 00:00:38,220
pieces of evidence is wrong. The phone company's records may be wrong. The clock may have been

8
00:00:38,220 --> 00:00:44,940
slow or fast or broken on another occasion. So it's very remotely possible that all the

9
00:00:44,940 --> 00:00:51,140
evidence is wrong. So what makes us confident that each piece of evidence is right? It's

10
00:00:51,140 --> 00:00:56,780
the fact that they all point to the same time. If each piece of evidence was wrong then the

11
00:00:56,820 --> 00:01:01,060
times they point to would be all over the place. The fact that they all point to the

12
00:01:01,060 --> 00:01:08,060
same time is called consistency. Consistency is what turns an observation into evidence

13
00:01:08,460 --> 00:01:13,820
and we all use it all the time to make deductions about what happened in the past. In the story

14
00:01:13,820 --> 00:01:19,240
of The Earth Made Easy I showed four photographs and asked people to deduce which was the earthquake,

15
00:01:19,240 --> 00:01:23,860
the tornado, the hurricane and the flood. I asked a lot of creationists to take the

16
00:01:23,860 --> 00:01:28,340
test but they were either vague about their results or refused to tell me whether they

17
00:01:28,340 --> 00:01:33,340
got the right answer and how they derived it. I suppose an admission that we can work

18
00:01:33,340 --> 00:01:38,580
this out is an admission that we can work out what happened in the past. But it doesn't

19
00:01:38,580 --> 00:01:43,840
matter, I know they got the right answer and we all know how they derived it. They looked

20
00:01:43,840 --> 00:01:50,200
for the same things any rational person looks for, consistency. If people living in this

21
00:01:50,200 --> 00:01:56,400
town told you this damage was caused by an earthquake you wouldn't believe it. Why not?

22
00:01:56,400 --> 00:02:01,200
Because the limited extent of the damage is inconsistent with an earthquake, or a flood

23
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:06,080
or a hurricane come to that. But the single trail of destruction is consistent with the

24
00:02:06,080 --> 00:02:12,800
path of a tornado. And if we look closer we'll discover that brick structures remain undamaged,

25
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:16,960
also inconsistent with an earthquake, while lighter objects have been strewn all over

26
00:02:16,960 --> 00:02:23,680
the place. Inconsistent with an earthquake, but entirely consistent with a typhoon. So it

27
00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:29,200
really doesn't matter what our eyewitnesses claim. Maybe they were mistaken or maybe they were lying

28
00:02:29,200 --> 00:02:35,240
or maybe they're delusional. Eyewitnesses often get things wrong but the evidence doesn't lie.

29
00:02:35,240 --> 00:02:41,720
We're intelligent enough to work things out for ourselves. Throughout this series which took us

30
00:02:41,720 --> 00:02:46,800
from the beginning of our universe to the human migration out of Africa, through all of this the

31
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:52,760
evidence has been consistent. All of the millions of pieces of individual evidence that form the

32
00:02:52,760 --> 00:02:58,480
hundreds of theories in dozens of different scientific fields, each and all are consistent

33
00:02:58,480 --> 00:03:04,920
with a single time frame and with each other. So the argument creationists use to suggest how

34
00:03:04,920 --> 00:03:10,920
one piece of evidence might possibly be wrong can't override one unanswerable fact that all

35
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:17,120
the scientific evidence is consistent. And none of the evidence is even remotely consistent with

36
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:24,200
the universe, Earth and every living thing in it being instantly created 6,000 years ago. So where

37
00:03:24,200 --> 00:03:29,280
an imaginary God was there to explain all the gaps in our knowledge, as we learn more about how the

38
00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:35,520
world works and how we got here, the role of this deity diminishes until it finds a place beyond the

39
00:03:35,520 --> 00:03:41,600
current extent of our knowledge inside the Big Bang. Cosmologists admit that they don't yet know

40
00:03:41,600 --> 00:03:46,320
what caused the Big Bang. I don't mind people telling me that their religion does have the

41
00:03:46,320 --> 00:03:51,600
answer and that it's the absolute unassailable truth. But if that's the case then let's have

42
00:03:51,600 --> 00:03:57,280
the details. Whatever lurks inside the world of quantum physics and singularity can't be masculine

43
00:03:57,280 --> 00:04:03,920
or feminine. So what is this God thing? What did it do to cause the Big Bang? How did it all happen?

44
00:04:03,920 --> 00:04:09,960
If you don't know then you really don't know much more than I do. The plain fact is that none of us

45
00:04:09,960 --> 00:04:16,240
yet knows so let's stop pretending we do. Sitting around arguing about what we don't know is like

46
00:04:16,240 --> 00:04:21,800
ancient Greeks trying to use philosophy to work out what powers the Sun. But one thing we do know

47
00:04:21,800 --> 00:04:27,280
is that we can't use the Bible or the Quran as evidence because the evidence we can see shows

48
00:04:27,280 --> 00:04:33,000
that these books are erroneous. Whatever it was that caused the Big Bang we know from observations

49
00:04:33,080 --> 00:04:39,880
how the world has unfolded since then. There was no Garden of Eden, no man made out of clay and a

50
00:04:39,880 --> 00:04:45,620
woman made out of a rib. We know this because we can trace our origins very clearly back to Africa

51
00:04:45,620 --> 00:04:52,040
over 100,000 years ago. There was no instant creation of all the animals. We have overwhelming

52
00:04:52,040 --> 00:04:57,240
evidence that animals evolved over hundreds of millions of years. There was no global flood.

53
00:04:57,240 --> 00:05:02,280
We've dug and drilled through miles of rock stretching back billions of years and the

54
00:05:02,280 --> 00:05:09,200
evidence for a worldwide flood 4,000 years ago just is not there. The universe was not made in

55
00:05:09,200 --> 00:05:15,520
a few days. It's nearly 14 billion years old and we can see galaxies so far away that the light from

56
00:05:15,520 --> 00:05:21,080
them takes billions of years to reach us. And since we know all this then we also know that

57
00:05:21,080 --> 00:05:27,680
the deity described in these holy books is a myth. A Bronze Age guess aimed at explaining the yawning

58
00:05:27,680 --> 00:05:33,800
gaps in our knowledge 3,000 years ago. The problem is these books have been believed for so long it's

59
00:05:33,800 --> 00:05:39,320
difficult to wean people off them and that makes for a dangerous world in which Bronze Age myths

60
00:05:39,320 --> 00:05:45,280
hold greater power over some leaders and some nations than rational thought. I'm not just

61
00:05:45,280 --> 00:05:49,880
talking about the obvious dangers of religious intolerance. The world is facing unprecedented

62
00:05:49,880 --> 00:05:55,840
environmental challenges in the 21st century. We can't act under the assumption that a benign

63
00:05:55,840 --> 00:06:02,280
being is watching over us and will make sure we come to no harm. Or worse follow a book that tells

64
00:06:02,280 --> 00:06:07,760
us the ultimate destruction of our environment is the will of some invisible deity and that the best

65
00:06:07,760 --> 00:06:13,760
way to save ourselves is not to try to fix the damage but to pray to the deity. This has been

66
00:06:13,760 --> 00:06:19,760
the futile practice of humans for thousands of years. Natives praying to a volcano god instead

67
00:06:19,760 --> 00:06:24,880
of taking to their canoes. I hope this series has shown why we can't afford to be complacent.

68
00:06:25,200 --> 00:06:31,200
If we assume the fate of our world is sealed and out of our hands then it soon will be.

69
00:06:31,200 --> 00:06:39,040
So what happens now? Well the series of videos that explains the evidence for our origins is

70
00:06:39,040 --> 00:06:45,160
finished. On this channel I'll continue to upload videos explaining scientific concepts and the next

71
00:06:45,160 --> 00:06:52,280
one will be the Ice Age Made Easy. And I've started a new channel Pothola54 Debunks to debunk

72
00:06:52,320 --> 00:06:58,680
creationist junk science and fake claims and also to answer questions. Because I expect a lot of

73
00:06:58,680 --> 00:07:03,840
complaints about the new series and attempts to get the channel blocked I'm keeping it separate

74
00:07:03,840 --> 00:07:09,440
from the Made Easy series on this channel. And finally thank you to all those who've written in

75
00:07:09,440 --> 00:07:14,960
to tell me I'm going to hell. You've probably realized by now that I'm impervious to these

76
00:07:14,960 --> 00:07:21,080
pathetic scare stories. And to those who've asked what if I'm wrong my answer is the same as yours.

77
00:07:21,080 --> 00:07:26,880
What if I tell you that you have to go outside right now and howl at the moon or a monster will

78
00:07:26,880 --> 00:07:32,440
crawl out from under your bed tonight and boil you in acid? You may think that's nonsense but

79
00:07:32,440 --> 00:07:38,840
what if you're wrong? As you can see when it's tried on you it just doesn't work. And to all

80
00:07:38,840 --> 00:07:43,920
those who've asked where I'll go when I die I'm happy to say I'll be in the same place I was in

81
00:07:43,920 --> 00:07:53,640
1947 and 1853 and 1622. I'll be a bunch of atoms spread across the landscape. Is that an awful

82
00:07:53,640 --> 00:07:59,000
picture? A hundred years ago not being alive didn't bother me so I don't suppose it will bother me a

83
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:07,080
hundred years from now. Let God's pale archangel, the grim reaper come. He can hack my bones, he can

84
00:08:07,080 --> 00:08:14,400
step up on my gravestone, he can kiss my bone, I don't care. Oh and one more thing, I'm delighted to take the

85
00:08:14,400 --> 00:08:18,480
blasphemy challenge and announce that I deny the Holy Spirit.

86
00:08:18,480 --> 00:08:39,280
He was a blacksmith by trade. He used to live on his own. She was a little old maid. She was all

87
00:08:39,280 --> 00:08:46,440
gristlin' bone, just a crone that you might not have fancied yourself. She was not born to attract.

88
00:08:46,440 --> 00:08:55,240
She was lined up for the shelf if it were not for the fact the blacksmith loved her well. He loved her

89
00:08:55,240 --> 00:09:08,160
like hell. He used to grunt and sigh fit to die but from afar for he was shy. As blacksmiths often

90
00:09:08,160 --> 00:09:17,840
learn. She made a meager livelihood from a homemade toffee that she'd sell. Up and down the

91
00:09:17,840 --> 00:09:26,640
neighborhood to a butterscotch and caramel clientele and optimistically she used to think that she'd get

92
00:09:26,640 --> 00:09:35,560
her husband yet. She was far too modest, too wink, too proud to be coquette. You bet cause she'd got

93
00:09:35,560 --> 00:09:46,120
a squint. She was skinny, she was skint. It never seemed that she, so palpably, bizarre but none could

94
00:09:46,120 --> 00:09:54,760
ever be a farmer fatter. Time has no time to spare.
