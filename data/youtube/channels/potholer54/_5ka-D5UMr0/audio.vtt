00:00.000 --> 00:05.240
Here's a little murder mystery. One morning police find the body of a murdered woman,

00:05.240 --> 00:10.960
her head bashed in by a clock. Its hands rest at ten o'clock. Her broken watch shows the

00:10.960 --> 00:16.260
same time. A doctor arrives and estimates the time of death based on body temperature

00:16.260 --> 00:21.360
at between nine forty five and ten fifteen the previous evening. Phone records show the

00:21.360 --> 00:27.460
woman made an emergency call at nine fifty seven, but the line was then cut. So here's

00:27.460 --> 00:33.200
the question. What time was the woman killed? It's possible of course that one of these

00:33.200 --> 00:38.220
pieces of evidence is wrong. The phone company's records may be wrong. The clock may have been

00:38.220 --> 00:44.940
slow or fast or broken on another occasion. So it's very remotely possible that all the

00:44.940 --> 00:51.140
evidence is wrong. So what makes us confident that each piece of evidence is right? It's

00:51.140 --> 00:56.780
the fact that they all point to the same time. If each piece of evidence was wrong then the

00:56.820 --> 01:01.060
times they point to would be all over the place. The fact that they all point to the

01:01.060 --> 01:08.060
same time is called consistency. Consistency is what turns an observation into evidence

01:08.460 --> 01:13.820
and we all use it all the time to make deductions about what happened in the past. In the story

01:13.820 --> 01:19.240
of The Earth Made Easy I showed four photographs and asked people to deduce which was the earthquake,

01:19.240 --> 01:23.860
the tornado, the hurricane and the flood. I asked a lot of creationists to take the

01:23.860 --> 01:28.340
test but they were either vague about their results or refused to tell me whether they

01:28.340 --> 01:33.340
got the right answer and how they derived it. I suppose an admission that we can work

01:33.340 --> 01:38.580
this out is an admission that we can work out what happened in the past. But it doesn't

01:38.580 --> 01:43.840
matter, I know they got the right answer and we all know how they derived it. They looked

01:43.840 --> 01:50.200
for the same things any rational person looks for, consistency. If people living in this

01:50.200 --> 01:56.400
town told you this damage was caused by an earthquake you wouldn't believe it. Why not?

01:56.400 --> 02:01.200
Because the limited extent of the damage is inconsistent with an earthquake, or a flood

02:01.200 --> 02:06.080
or a hurricane come to that. But the single trail of destruction is consistent with the

02:06.080 --> 02:12.800
path of a tornado. And if we look closer we'll discover that brick structures remain undamaged,

02:12.800 --> 02:16.960
also inconsistent with an earthquake, while lighter objects have been strewn all over

02:16.960 --> 02:23.680
the place. Inconsistent with an earthquake, but entirely consistent with a typhoon. So it

02:23.680 --> 02:29.200
really doesn't matter what our eyewitnesses claim. Maybe they were mistaken or maybe they were lying

02:29.200 --> 02:35.240
or maybe they're delusional. Eyewitnesses often get things wrong but the evidence doesn't lie.

02:35.240 --> 02:41.720
We're intelligent enough to work things out for ourselves. Throughout this series which took us

02:41.720 --> 02:46.800
from the beginning of our universe to the human migration out of Africa, through all of this the

02:46.800 --> 02:52.760
evidence has been consistent. All of the millions of pieces of individual evidence that form the

02:52.760 --> 02:58.480
hundreds of theories in dozens of different scientific fields, each and all are consistent

02:58.480 --> 03:04.920
with a single time frame and with each other. So the argument creationists use to suggest how

03:04.920 --> 03:10.920
one piece of evidence might possibly be wrong can't override one unanswerable fact that all

03:11.000 --> 03:17.120
the scientific evidence is consistent. And none of the evidence is even remotely consistent with

03:17.120 --> 03:24.200
the universe, Earth and every living thing in it being instantly created 6,000 years ago. So where

03:24.200 --> 03:29.280
an imaginary God was there to explain all the gaps in our knowledge, as we learn more about how the

03:29.280 --> 03:35.520
world works and how we got here, the role of this deity diminishes until it finds a place beyond the

03:35.520 --> 03:41.600
current extent of our knowledge inside the Big Bang. Cosmologists admit that they don't yet know

03:41.600 --> 03:46.320
what caused the Big Bang. I don't mind people telling me that their religion does have the

03:46.320 --> 03:51.600
answer and that it's the absolute unassailable truth. But if that's the case then let's have

03:51.600 --> 03:57.280
the details. Whatever lurks inside the world of quantum physics and singularity can't be masculine

03:57.280 --> 04:03.920
or feminine. So what is this God thing? What did it do to cause the Big Bang? How did it all happen?

04:03.920 --> 04:09.960
If you don't know then you really don't know much more than I do. The plain fact is that none of us

04:09.960 --> 04:16.240
yet knows so let's stop pretending we do. Sitting around arguing about what we don't know is like

04:16.240 --> 04:21.800
ancient Greeks trying to use philosophy to work out what powers the Sun. But one thing we do know

04:21.800 --> 04:27.280
is that we can't use the Bible or the Quran as evidence because the evidence we can see shows

04:27.280 --> 04:33.000
that these books are erroneous. Whatever it was that caused the Big Bang we know from observations

04:33.080 --> 04:39.880
how the world has unfolded since then. There was no Garden of Eden, no man made out of clay and a

04:39.880 --> 04:45.620
woman made out of a rib. We know this because we can trace our origins very clearly back to Africa

04:45.620 --> 04:52.040
over 100,000 years ago. There was no instant creation of all the animals. We have overwhelming

04:52.040 --> 04:57.240
evidence that animals evolved over hundreds of millions of years. There was no global flood.

04:57.240 --> 05:02.280
We've dug and drilled through miles of rock stretching back billions of years and the

05:02.280 --> 05:09.200
evidence for a worldwide flood 4,000 years ago just is not there. The universe was not made in

05:09.200 --> 05:15.520
a few days. It's nearly 14 billion years old and we can see galaxies so far away that the light from

05:15.520 --> 05:21.080
them takes billions of years to reach us. And since we know all this then we also know that

05:21.080 --> 05:27.680
the deity described in these holy books is a myth. A Bronze Age guess aimed at explaining the yawning

05:27.680 --> 05:33.800
gaps in our knowledge 3,000 years ago. The problem is these books have been believed for so long it's

05:33.800 --> 05:39.320
difficult to wean people off them and that makes for a dangerous world in which Bronze Age myths

05:39.320 --> 05:45.280
hold greater power over some leaders and some nations than rational thought. I'm not just

05:45.280 --> 05:49.880
talking about the obvious dangers of religious intolerance. The world is facing unprecedented

05:49.880 --> 05:55.840
environmental challenges in the 21st century. We can't act under the assumption that a benign

05:55.840 --> 06:02.280
being is watching over us and will make sure we come to no harm. Or worse follow a book that tells

06:02.280 --> 06:07.760
us the ultimate destruction of our environment is the will of some invisible deity and that the best

06:07.760 --> 06:13.760
way to save ourselves is not to try to fix the damage but to pray to the deity. This has been

06:13.760 --> 06:19.760
the futile practice of humans for thousands of years. Natives praying to a volcano god instead

06:19.760 --> 06:24.880
of taking to their canoes. I hope this series has shown why we can't afford to be complacent.

06:25.200 --> 06:31.200
If we assume the fate of our world is sealed and out of our hands then it soon will be.

06:31.200 --> 06:39.040
So what happens now? Well the series of videos that explains the evidence for our origins is

06:39.040 --> 06:45.160
finished. On this channel I'll continue to upload videos explaining scientific concepts and the next

06:45.160 --> 06:52.280
one will be the Ice Age Made Easy. And I've started a new channel Pothola54 Debunks to debunk

06:52.320 --> 06:58.680
creationist junk science and fake claims and also to answer questions. Because I expect a lot of

06:58.680 --> 07:03.840
complaints about the new series and attempts to get the channel blocked I'm keeping it separate

07:03.840 --> 07:09.440
from the Made Easy series on this channel. And finally thank you to all those who've written in

07:09.440 --> 07:14.960
to tell me I'm going to hell. You've probably realized by now that I'm impervious to these

07:14.960 --> 07:21.080
pathetic scare stories. And to those who've asked what if I'm wrong my answer is the same as yours.

07:21.080 --> 07:26.880
What if I tell you that you have to go outside right now and howl at the moon or a monster will

07:26.880 --> 07:32.440
crawl out from under your bed tonight and boil you in acid? You may think that's nonsense but

07:32.440 --> 07:38.840
what if you're wrong? As you can see when it's tried on you it just doesn't work. And to all

07:38.840 --> 07:43.920
those who've asked where I'll go when I die I'm happy to say I'll be in the same place I was in

07:43.920 --> 07:53.640
1947 and 1853 and 1622. I'll be a bunch of atoms spread across the landscape. Is that an awful

07:53.640 --> 07:59.000
picture? A hundred years ago not being alive didn't bother me so I don't suppose it will bother me a

07:59.000 --> 08:07.080
hundred years from now. Let God's pale archangel, the grim reaper come. He can hack my bones, he can

08:07.080 --> 08:14.400
step up on my gravestone, he can kiss my bone, I don't care. Oh and one more thing, I'm delighted to take the

08:14.400 --> 08:18.480
blasphemy challenge and announce that I deny the Holy Spirit.

08:18.480 --> 08:39.280
He was a blacksmith by trade. He used to live on his own. She was a little old maid. She was all

08:39.280 --> 08:46.440
gristlin' bone, just a crone that you might not have fancied yourself. She was not born to attract.

08:46.440 --> 08:55.240
She was lined up for the shelf if it were not for the fact the blacksmith loved her well. He loved her

08:55.240 --> 09:08.160
like hell. He used to grunt and sigh fit to die but from afar for he was shy. As blacksmiths often

09:08.160 --> 09:17.840
learn. She made a meager livelihood from a homemade toffee that she'd sell. Up and down the

09:17.840 --> 09:26.640
neighborhood to a butterscotch and caramel clientele and optimistically she used to think that she'd get

09:26.640 --> 09:35.560
her husband yet. She was far too modest, too wink, too proud to be coquette. You bet cause she'd got

09:35.560 --> 09:46.120
a squint. She was skinny, she was skint. It never seemed that she, so palpably, bizarre but none could

09:46.120 --> 09:54.760
ever be a farmer fatter. Time has no time to spare.
