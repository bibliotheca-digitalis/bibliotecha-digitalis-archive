0	5720	Pothola54 kindly took the time to respond to my video on the Maldives in which I wondered
5720	10240	out loud how outrageous claims made about it in the name of climate change could possibly
10240	11240	be true.
11240	14040	Thanks Academic Agent, you're welcome.
14040	20040	And just a reminder, here was the outrageous claim that AA, Academic Agent, is referring
20040	21040	to.
21040	24880	Scientists have been giving grave warnings about the Maldives for many years.
24880	29840	In 1988 they predicted that it may be submerged in 30 years time.
29840	33160	Maldives may be under the sea by the year 2030.
33160	36800	And AA wondered why, therefore people were investing in the islands.
36800	41240	Don't they know that their money will be under the sea before long?
41240	47160	So who was making this outrageous claim about the Maldives being under the sea by 2030?
47160	53400	As I showed in my response video, it wasn't scientists and it wasn't even the Mail Online.
53400	56160	It was the Academic Agent himself.
56160	58960	The media distorted and misreported the facts.
59000	64400	Sorry AA, but it's no good blaming the media for the fact that you misread the Mail Online
64400	65520	story.
65520	70600	The problem seems to be that you only read the headline, which is where you got the 2030
70600	71700	date from.
71700	75680	If you'd read the body of the story, you would have seen that there was a range of dates
75680	79360	from the 2030s to the 2060s.
79360	83400	And you assumed that uninhabitability meant being under the sea.
83400	85380	It doesn't mean that at all.
85380	88260	Even the Mail Online never suggested that.
88260	92220	If you'd checked the Mail Source, which is a scientific study, you would have found all
92220	96780	the relevant dates and what uninhabitability entails.
96780	101620	The Academic Agent's reason for not reading the study is that people, I presume he means
101620	107500	himself, don't have access to academic journals and they don't have training in stats.
107500	112380	But to get access to the study the Mail was citing, all I had to do was google an obvious
112380	115980	key word in the Mail story and the year.
115980	118780	I found the paper in about 30 seconds.
118780	120300	It's publicly available.
120300	122520	Anyone can download it.
122520	125500	And you don't need any training in stats to read it.
125500	129380	I suck at stats, but the paper was in plain English.
129380	135380	What Pothola reports about what the actual science says, I was correct!
135380	138420	No, you didn't get the science right either.
138420	142180	It's funny because in an audio call-in you accepted that.
142180	147180	I made the fatal error of saying scientists say, and apparently if you go back to the
147180	152340	original journal article the scientists didn't say that, you know, the media got it wrong.
152340	153840	Well you got it wrong.
153840	156520	But OK, does that matter?
156520	158700	And the answer is yes, of course.
158700	163220	There's a huge campaign these days trying to discredit scientists by quoting or inventing
163220	167980	ridiculous claims and then pretending that these are the conclusions of scientists in
167980	170860	order to bring science into disrepute.
170860	176380	I'm sure this was just bad reporting by the academic agent rather than a deliberate ploy,
176380	181700	but either way the academic agent's subscribers believe what he tells them.
181700	187820	Either the media, the activists and the likes of Greta or let us say the AOC or Bill Nye
187820	195180	the Science Guy are correct and we should be alarmed or the science is correct and the
195180	200020	truth is that the concerns we hear about almost daily are very, very overblown.
200180	202580	No, it's not either or.
202580	208100	Bill Nye and Greta may get some facts correct and they may get others wrong, just as the
208100	210340	academic agent does.
210340	214940	Just as all bloggers, politicians, newspapers and political activists do.
214940	219860	It's our responsibility, if we're going to report on the science, to correct assertions
219860	224420	that are wrong and disseminate those that are factually accurate.
224420	228500	In this particular case, if the Mail Online had raised concerns that the Maldives will
228500	233860	be underwater by 2030, then of course that would be overblown.
233860	236340	But the Mail never made any such claim.
236340	241300	That was something the academic agent made up himself and he simply assumed that that's
241300	244660	what the scientific study had concluded.
244660	249220	Now that AA knows scientists are not saying the Maldives will be submerged in 12 years'
249220	254580	time, it's a century away, he's gone to the opposite extreme and assumes researchers are
254580	257380	saying there's no immediate concern.
257380	259860	But that isn't the case either.
259860	264780	What researchers are saying is that although total inundation beneath the waves is a century
264780	270940	away, the Maldives will become increasingly uninhabitable long before that, as sea level
270940	278140	rise triggers more regular overwash, causing infrastructure damage and salty groundwater.
278140	283020	As the authors of the study explain, how soon and how quickly this occurs depends on how
283020	289300	much CO2 concentration rises over the next few decades, and that depends on the decisions
289300	291340	we make now.
291340	295700	It's also a concern now for children growing up in the Maldives, who will have to deal
295700	301220	with the consequences of more frequent overwash, salty drinking water, damaged and destroyed
301220	305220	infrastructure, and eventual evacuation of their islands.
305220	308980	They don't see these concerns as overblown at all.
308980	313460	Now of course I agree with the academic agent that there's a lot of bullshit in the public
313460	314580	arena.
314580	320540	Politicians make dumb remarks like, the world will end in 12 years, and that ice melt can't
320540	322540	cause sea level rise.
322540	328020	Tabloid newspapers, videos and blogs make so many ridiculous or misleading claims that
328020	330620	I have a hard time keeping up.
330620	336420	The answer isn't to embellish these misrepresentations and make up an even more fanciful claim, and
336420	341540	then claim to have been right all along, the answer is to correct them.
341540	346540	So I hope you take this criticism as constructive AA, and I would urge you, when you want to
346540	351420	expose a misleading claim, find one that really is misleading.
351420	356160	Quote it so that people can see you haven't misunderstood or misrepresented it.
356160	359180	Then fact check the claim by doing some research.
359180	363940	I've debunked lots of these silly claims on my channel, so do feel free to borrow some.
