00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,720
Pothola54 kindly took the time to respond to my video on the Maldives in which I wondered

2
00:00:05,720 --> 00:00:10,240
out loud how outrageous claims made about it in the name of climate change could possibly

3
00:00:10,240 --> 00:00:11,240
be true.

4
00:00:11,240 --> 00:00:14,040
Thanks Academic Agent, you're welcome.

5
00:00:14,040 --> 00:00:20,040
And just a reminder, here was the outrageous claim that AA, Academic Agent, is referring

6
00:00:20,040 --> 00:00:21,040
to.

7
00:00:21,040 --> 00:00:24,880
Scientists have been giving grave warnings about the Maldives for many years.

8
00:00:24,880 --> 00:00:29,840
In 1988 they predicted that it may be submerged in 30 years time.

9
00:00:29,840 --> 00:00:33,160
Maldives may be under the sea by the year 2030.

10
00:00:33,160 --> 00:00:36,800
And AA wondered why, therefore people were investing in the islands.

11
00:00:36,800 --> 00:00:41,240
Don't they know that their money will be under the sea before long?

12
00:00:41,240 --> 00:00:47,160
So who was making this outrageous claim about the Maldives being under the sea by 2030?

13
00:00:47,160 --> 00:00:53,400
As I showed in my response video, it wasn't scientists and it wasn't even the Mail Online.

14
00:00:53,400 --> 00:00:56,160
It was the Academic Agent himself.

15
00:00:56,160 --> 00:00:58,960
The media distorted and misreported the facts.

16
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:04,400
Sorry AA, but it's no good blaming the media for the fact that you misread the Mail Online

17
00:01:04,400 --> 00:01:05,520
story.

18
00:01:05,520 --> 00:01:10,600
The problem seems to be that you only read the headline, which is where you got the 2030

19
00:01:10,600 --> 00:01:11,700
date from.

20
00:01:11,700 --> 00:01:15,680
If you'd read the body of the story, you would have seen that there was a range of dates

21
00:01:15,680 --> 00:01:19,360
from the 2030s to the 2060s.

22
00:01:19,360 --> 00:01:23,400
And you assumed that uninhabitability meant being under the sea.

23
00:01:23,400 --> 00:01:25,380
It doesn't mean that at all.

24
00:01:25,380 --> 00:01:28,260
Even the Mail Online never suggested that.

25
00:01:28,260 --> 00:01:32,220
If you'd checked the Mail Source, which is a scientific study, you would have found all

26
00:01:32,220 --> 00:01:36,780
the relevant dates and what uninhabitability entails.

27
00:01:36,780 --> 00:01:41,620
The Academic Agent's reason for not reading the study is that people, I presume he means

28
00:01:41,620 --> 00:01:47,500
himself, don't have access to academic journals and they don't have training in stats.

29
00:01:47,500 --> 00:01:52,380
But to get access to the study the Mail was citing, all I had to do was google an obvious

30
00:01:52,380 --> 00:01:55,980
key word in the Mail story and the year.

31
00:01:55,980 --> 00:01:58,780
I found the paper in about 30 seconds.

32
00:01:58,780 --> 00:02:00,300
It's publicly available.

33
00:02:00,300 --> 00:02:02,520
Anyone can download it.

34
00:02:02,520 --> 00:02:05,500
And you don't need any training in stats to read it.

35
00:02:05,500 --> 00:02:09,380
I suck at stats, but the paper was in plain English.

36
00:02:09,380 --> 00:02:15,380
What Pothola reports about what the actual science says, I was correct!

37
00:02:15,380 --> 00:02:18,420
No, you didn't get the science right either.

38
00:02:18,420 --> 00:02:22,180
It's funny because in an audio call-in you accepted that.

39
00:02:22,180 --> 00:02:27,180
I made the fatal error of saying scientists say, and apparently if you go back to the

40
00:02:27,180 --> 00:02:32,340
original journal article the scientists didn't say that, you know, the media got it wrong.

41
00:02:32,340 --> 00:02:33,840
Well you got it wrong.

42
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:36,520
But OK, does that matter?

43
00:02:36,520 --> 00:02:38,700
And the answer is yes, of course.

44
00:02:38,700 --> 00:02:43,220
There's a huge campaign these days trying to discredit scientists by quoting or inventing

45
00:02:43,220 --> 00:02:47,980
ridiculous claims and then pretending that these are the conclusions of scientists in

46
00:02:47,980 --> 00:02:50,860
order to bring science into disrepute.

47
00:02:50,860 --> 00:02:56,380
I'm sure this was just bad reporting by the academic agent rather than a deliberate ploy,

48
00:02:56,380 --> 00:03:01,700
but either way the academic agent's subscribers believe what he tells them.

49
00:03:01,700 --> 00:03:07,820
Either the media, the activists and the likes of Greta or let us say the AOC or Bill Nye

50
00:03:07,820 --> 00:03:15,180
the Science Guy are correct and we should be alarmed or the science is correct and the

51
00:03:15,180 --> 00:03:20,020
truth is that the concerns we hear about almost daily are very, very overblown.

52
00:03:20,180 --> 00:03:22,580
No, it's not either or.

53
00:03:22,580 --> 00:03:28,100
Bill Nye and Greta may get some facts correct and they may get others wrong, just as the

54
00:03:28,100 --> 00:03:30,340
academic agent does.

55
00:03:30,340 --> 00:03:34,940
Just as all bloggers, politicians, newspapers and political activists do.

56
00:03:34,940 --> 00:03:39,860
It's our responsibility, if we're going to report on the science, to correct assertions

57
00:03:39,860 --> 00:03:44,420
that are wrong and disseminate those that are factually accurate.

58
00:03:44,420 --> 00:03:48,500
In this particular case, if the Mail Online had raised concerns that the Maldives will

59
00:03:48,500 --> 00:03:53,860
be underwater by 2030, then of course that would be overblown.

60
00:03:53,860 --> 00:03:56,340
But the Mail never made any such claim.

61
00:03:56,340 --> 00:04:01,300
That was something the academic agent made up himself and he simply assumed that that's

62
00:04:01,300 --> 00:04:04,660
what the scientific study had concluded.

63
00:04:04,660 --> 00:04:09,220
Now that AA knows scientists are not saying the Maldives will be submerged in 12 years'

64
00:04:09,220 --> 00:04:14,580
time, it's a century away, he's gone to the opposite extreme and assumes researchers are

65
00:04:14,580 --> 00:04:17,380
saying there's no immediate concern.

66
00:04:17,380 --> 00:04:19,860
But that isn't the case either.

67
00:04:19,860 --> 00:04:24,780
What researchers are saying is that although total inundation beneath the waves is a century

68
00:04:24,780 --> 00:04:30,940
away, the Maldives will become increasingly uninhabitable long before that, as sea level

69
00:04:30,940 --> 00:04:38,140
rise triggers more regular overwash, causing infrastructure damage and salty groundwater.

70
00:04:38,140 --> 00:04:43,020
As the authors of the study explain, how soon and how quickly this occurs depends on how

71
00:04:43,020 --> 00:04:49,300
much CO2 concentration rises over the next few decades, and that depends on the decisions

72
00:04:49,300 --> 00:04:51,340
we make now.

73
00:04:51,340 --> 00:04:55,700
It's also a concern now for children growing up in the Maldives, who will have to deal

74
00:04:55,700 --> 00:05:01,220
with the consequences of more frequent overwash, salty drinking water, damaged and destroyed

75
00:05:01,220 --> 00:05:05,220
infrastructure, and eventual evacuation of their islands.

76
00:05:05,220 --> 00:05:08,980
They don't see these concerns as overblown at all.

77
00:05:08,980 --> 00:05:13,460
Now of course I agree with the academic agent that there's a lot of bullshit in the public

78
00:05:13,460 --> 00:05:14,580
arena.

79
00:05:14,580 --> 00:05:20,540
Politicians make dumb remarks like, the world will end in 12 years, and that ice melt can't

80
00:05:20,540 --> 00:05:22,540
cause sea level rise.

81
00:05:22,540 --> 00:05:28,020
Tabloid newspapers, videos and blogs make so many ridiculous or misleading claims that

82
00:05:28,020 --> 00:05:30,620
I have a hard time keeping up.

83
00:05:30,620 --> 00:05:36,420
The answer isn't to embellish these misrepresentations and make up an even more fanciful claim, and

84
00:05:36,420 --> 00:05:41,540
then claim to have been right all along, the answer is to correct them.

85
00:05:41,540 --> 00:05:46,540
So I hope you take this criticism as constructive AA, and I would urge you, when you want to

86
00:05:46,540 --> 00:05:51,420
expose a misleading claim, find one that really is misleading.

87
00:05:51,420 --> 00:05:56,160
Quote it so that people can see you haven't misunderstood or misrepresented it.

88
00:05:56,160 --> 00:05:59,180
Then fact check the claim by doing some research.

89
00:05:59,180 --> 00:06:03,940
I've debunked lots of these silly claims on my channel, so do feel free to borrow some.
