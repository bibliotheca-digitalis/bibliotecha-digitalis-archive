00:00.000 --> 00:05.720
Pothola54 kindly took the time to respond to my video on the Maldives in which I wondered

00:05.720 --> 00:10.240
out loud how outrageous claims made about it in the name of climate change could possibly

00:10.240 --> 00:11.240
be true.

00:11.240 --> 00:14.040
Thanks Academic Agent, you're welcome.

00:14.040 --> 00:20.040
And just a reminder, here was the outrageous claim that AA, Academic Agent, is referring

00:20.040 --> 00:21.040
to.

00:21.040 --> 00:24.880
Scientists have been giving grave warnings about the Maldives for many years.

00:24.880 --> 00:29.840
In 1988 they predicted that it may be submerged in 30 years time.

00:29.840 --> 00:33.160
Maldives may be under the sea by the year 2030.

00:33.160 --> 00:36.800
And AA wondered why, therefore people were investing in the islands.

00:36.800 --> 00:41.240
Don't they know that their money will be under the sea before long?

00:41.240 --> 00:47.160
So who was making this outrageous claim about the Maldives being under the sea by 2030?

00:47.160 --> 00:53.400
As I showed in my response video, it wasn't scientists and it wasn't even the Mail Online.

00:53.400 --> 00:56.160
It was the Academic Agent himself.

00:56.160 --> 00:58.960
The media distorted and misreported the facts.

00:59.000 --> 01:04.400
Sorry AA, but it's no good blaming the media for the fact that you misread the Mail Online

01:04.400 --> 01:05.520
story.

01:05.520 --> 01:10.600
The problem seems to be that you only read the headline, which is where you got the 2030

01:10.600 --> 01:11.700
date from.

01:11.700 --> 01:15.680
If you'd read the body of the story, you would have seen that there was a range of dates

01:15.680 --> 01:19.360
from the 2030s to the 2060s.

01:19.360 --> 01:23.400
And you assumed that uninhabitability meant being under the sea.

01:23.400 --> 01:25.380
It doesn't mean that at all.

01:25.380 --> 01:28.260
Even the Mail Online never suggested that.

01:28.260 --> 01:32.220
If you'd checked the Mail Source, which is a scientific study, you would have found all

01:32.220 --> 01:36.780
the relevant dates and what uninhabitability entails.

01:36.780 --> 01:41.620
The Academic Agent's reason for not reading the study is that people, I presume he means

01:41.620 --> 01:47.500
himself, don't have access to academic journals and they don't have training in stats.

01:47.500 --> 01:52.380
But to get access to the study the Mail was citing, all I had to do was google an obvious

01:52.380 --> 01:55.980
key word in the Mail story and the year.

01:55.980 --> 01:58.780
I found the paper in about 30 seconds.

01:58.780 --> 02:00.300
It's publicly available.

02:00.300 --> 02:02.520
Anyone can download it.

02:02.520 --> 02:05.500
And you don't need any training in stats to read it.

02:05.500 --> 02:09.380
I suck at stats, but the paper was in plain English.

02:09.380 --> 02:15.380
What Pothola reports about what the actual science says, I was correct!

02:15.380 --> 02:18.420
No, you didn't get the science right either.

02:18.420 --> 02:22.180
It's funny because in an audio call-in you accepted that.

02:22.180 --> 02:27.180
I made the fatal error of saying scientists say, and apparently if you go back to the

02:27.180 --> 02:32.340
original journal article the scientists didn't say that, you know, the media got it wrong.

02:32.340 --> 02:33.840
Well you got it wrong.

02:33.840 --> 02:36.520
But OK, does that matter?

02:36.520 --> 02:38.700
And the answer is yes, of course.

02:38.700 --> 02:43.220
There's a huge campaign these days trying to discredit scientists by quoting or inventing

02:43.220 --> 02:47.980
ridiculous claims and then pretending that these are the conclusions of scientists in

02:47.980 --> 02:50.860
order to bring science into disrepute.

02:50.860 --> 02:56.380
I'm sure this was just bad reporting by the academic agent rather than a deliberate ploy,

02:56.380 --> 03:01.700
but either way the academic agent's subscribers believe what he tells them.

03:01.700 --> 03:07.820
Either the media, the activists and the likes of Greta or let us say the AOC or Bill Nye

03:07.820 --> 03:15.180
the Science Guy are correct and we should be alarmed or the science is correct and the

03:15.180 --> 03:20.020
truth is that the concerns we hear about almost daily are very, very overblown.

03:20.180 --> 03:22.580
No, it's not either or.

03:22.580 --> 03:28.100
Bill Nye and Greta may get some facts correct and they may get others wrong, just as the

03:28.100 --> 03:30.340
academic agent does.

03:30.340 --> 03:34.940
Just as all bloggers, politicians, newspapers and political activists do.

03:34.940 --> 03:39.860
It's our responsibility, if we're going to report on the science, to correct assertions

03:39.860 --> 03:44.420
that are wrong and disseminate those that are factually accurate.

03:44.420 --> 03:48.500
In this particular case, if the Mail Online had raised concerns that the Maldives will

03:48.500 --> 03:53.860
be underwater by 2030, then of course that would be overblown.

03:53.860 --> 03:56.340
But the Mail never made any such claim.

03:56.340 --> 04:01.300
That was something the academic agent made up himself and he simply assumed that that's

04:01.300 --> 04:04.660
what the scientific study had concluded.

04:04.660 --> 04:09.220
Now that AA knows scientists are not saying the Maldives will be submerged in 12 years'

04:09.220 --> 04:14.580
time, it's a century away, he's gone to the opposite extreme and assumes researchers are

04:14.580 --> 04:17.380
saying there's no immediate concern.

04:17.380 --> 04:19.860
But that isn't the case either.

04:19.860 --> 04:24.780
What researchers are saying is that although total inundation beneath the waves is a century

04:24.780 --> 04:30.940
away, the Maldives will become increasingly uninhabitable long before that, as sea level

04:30.940 --> 04:38.140
rise triggers more regular overwash, causing infrastructure damage and salty groundwater.

04:38.140 --> 04:43.020
As the authors of the study explain, how soon and how quickly this occurs depends on how

04:43.020 --> 04:49.300
much CO2 concentration rises over the next few decades, and that depends on the decisions

04:49.300 --> 04:51.340
we make now.

04:51.340 --> 04:55.700
It's also a concern now for children growing up in the Maldives, who will have to deal

04:55.700 --> 05:01.220
with the consequences of more frequent overwash, salty drinking water, damaged and destroyed

05:01.220 --> 05:05.220
infrastructure, and eventual evacuation of their islands.

05:05.220 --> 05:08.980
They don't see these concerns as overblown at all.

05:08.980 --> 05:13.460
Now of course I agree with the academic agent that there's a lot of bullshit in the public

05:13.460 --> 05:14.580
arena.

05:14.580 --> 05:20.540
Politicians make dumb remarks like, the world will end in 12 years, and that ice melt can't

05:20.540 --> 05:22.540
cause sea level rise.

05:22.540 --> 05:28.020
Tabloid newspapers, videos and blogs make so many ridiculous or misleading claims that

05:28.020 --> 05:30.620
I have a hard time keeping up.

05:30.620 --> 05:36.420
The answer isn't to embellish these misrepresentations and make up an even more fanciful claim, and

05:36.420 --> 05:41.540
then claim to have been right all along, the answer is to correct them.

05:41.540 --> 05:46.540
So I hope you take this criticism as constructive AA, and I would urge you, when you want to

05:46.540 --> 05:51.420
expose a misleading claim, find one that really is misleading.

05:51.420 --> 05:56.160
Quote it so that people can see you haven't misunderstood or misrepresented it.

05:56.160 --> 05:59.180
Then fact check the claim by doing some research.

05:59.180 --> 06:03.940
I've debunked lots of these silly claims on my channel, so do feel free to borrow some.
