00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,400
As I reported last month, Christopher Monckton backed out of a debate we were having on the

2
00:00:04,400 --> 00:00:06,280
website What's Up With That.

3
00:00:06,280 --> 00:00:10,500
Well, I'm still offering him the chance to continue the debate and provide the response

4
00:00:10,500 --> 00:00:13,680
he promised, but it'll be on a new site.

5
00:00:13,680 --> 00:00:19,120
I'll give details at the end of this video, but first I have to explain what's happened.

6
00:00:19,120 --> 00:00:22,620
Monckton's decision to pull the plug on the debate has been swiftly endorsed by the man

7
00:00:22,620 --> 00:00:26,800
who runs the What's Up With That site, Anthony Watts.

8
00:00:26,800 --> 00:00:31,000
I first got word of this not from Anthony, but from people who began commenting on it

9
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:32,280
on my channel.

10
00:00:32,280 --> 00:00:36,640
It turns out he'd written this in the comments section of a Monckton guest post on What's

11
00:00:36,640 --> 00:00:38,100
Up With That.

12
00:00:38,100 --> 00:00:43,360
He was referring to an interview with me that Peter Sinclair, aka Green Man, had posted

13
00:00:43,360 --> 00:00:44,360
on his website.

14
00:00:44,360 --> 00:00:50,200
While I can't hear what Hadfield is saying, they seem totally infatuated with their manhunt,

15
00:00:50,200 --> 00:00:54,520
so much for Hadfield's repeated claims of being dispassionate and logical.

16
00:00:54,520 --> 00:00:56,000
Thanks for posting this.

17
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:00,440
When he starts colluding with that hateful Green Man, all semblance of rational debate

18
00:01:00,440 --> 00:01:01,880
is destroyed.

19
00:01:01,880 --> 00:01:06,240
This video then cements my decision not to provide any further space to Hadfield here.

20
00:01:06,240 --> 00:01:10,240
Well, Anthony, I don't know if Sinclair is hateful or not.

21
00:01:10,240 --> 00:01:14,460
Sinclair emailed me very politely, asking if he could do an interview, and I saw no

22
00:01:14,460 --> 00:01:16,000
reason to refuse him.

23
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:21,760
See, I'm not really interested in this rather silly us-versus-them catfight that so many

24
00:01:21,760 --> 00:01:25,440
people seem to think substitutes for a debate about the facts.

25
00:01:25,440 --> 00:01:27,400
I don't have hate lists.

26
00:01:27,400 --> 00:01:31,840
Everyone's welcome on my channel, whoever they are and whomever they talk to.

27
00:01:31,840 --> 00:01:35,440
But as I've said before, Anthony, you have a perfect right to run your channel as you

28
00:01:35,440 --> 00:01:41,280
see fit, to ban anyone you want and block any comments you don't like.

29
00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:44,740
As for the idea that we seem to be on a manhunt, even though you couldn't make out what was

30
00:01:44,740 --> 00:01:48,040
being said, I can assure you there is no manhunt.

31
00:01:48,040 --> 00:01:51,200
I'm not looking for Monckton, and it doesn't really matter where he is.

32
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:55,560
All he has to do is post his promised response and answer the allegations that have been

33
00:01:55,560 --> 00:01:58,120
clearly laid out and documented.

34
00:01:58,120 --> 00:02:02,360
Perhaps instead of defending him, you should ask him why he doesn't do that.

35
00:02:02,360 --> 00:02:06,080
But I do have one beef, and that is with you making up quotes.

36
00:02:06,080 --> 00:02:10,000
I've never said I was dispassionate and logical.

37
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:12,200
Not once, let alone repeatedly.

38
00:02:12,200 --> 00:02:16,040
Firstly, it sounds arrogant for me to make assertions like this.

39
00:02:16,040 --> 00:02:21,320
Secondly, whether the quote is flattering or not, making up quotes is simply wrong.

40
00:02:21,320 --> 00:02:26,600
Okay, I could explain why making up quotes is wrong, but this should be understood without

41
00:02:26,600 --> 00:02:27,920
having to have it explained.

42
00:02:27,920 --> 00:02:31,800
It's one of the first things they teach at journalism school, one of the first things

43
00:02:31,800 --> 00:02:37,320
academics learn when they do their research, and something even politicians realise.

44
00:02:37,320 --> 00:02:39,800
And this brings us back to the debate.

45
00:02:39,800 --> 00:02:44,520
Because Monckton, a politician, does know that his misquotes will be damaging to him,

46
00:02:44,520 --> 00:02:47,320
which is why he backed out of the debate.

47
00:02:47,320 --> 00:02:51,640
A few days after his comment was posted, I did get official word from Anthony Watts that

48
00:02:51,640 --> 00:02:53,640
he was pulling the plug on the debate.

49
00:02:53,640 --> 00:02:58,960
Oh well, I was delighted that Mr Watts had even allowed the debate to begin, given that

50
00:02:58,960 --> 00:03:03,840
so many of his readers, and even one of his moderators, professed themselves admirers

51
00:03:03,840 --> 00:03:05,200
of Monckton.

52
00:03:05,200 --> 00:03:08,080
It was a courageous act, and one that surprised me.

53
00:03:08,080 --> 00:03:12,240
So Anthony, I certainly don't take back my thanks to you for allowing your readers to

54
00:03:12,240 --> 00:03:16,680
glimpse some of Mr Monckton's sources that clearly contradict the claims he made for

55
00:03:16,680 --> 00:03:17,680
them.

56
00:03:17,680 --> 00:03:22,840
Fortunately, there are other internet sites that are willing to see a free and fair debate.

57
00:03:22,840 --> 00:03:27,840
I'm certainly willing to host one on my channel, and I've made that invitation to Mr Monckton.

58
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:32,200
And I was approached by a website called the League of Reason for that same purpose.

59
00:03:32,200 --> 00:03:36,080
I've readily agreed for the debate to be hosted on their website.

60
00:03:36,080 --> 00:03:41,000
I understand they've also invited Mr Monckton, and asked him to send his promised response,

61
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:43,600
which is now two months overdue.

62
00:03:43,600 --> 00:03:48,240
According to his supporters on what's up with that, Monckton can whip me easily.

63
00:03:48,240 --> 00:03:54,080
Great, if you think a debate about accurately quoting sources is a football game, then why

64
00:03:54,080 --> 00:03:54,880
doesn't he?
