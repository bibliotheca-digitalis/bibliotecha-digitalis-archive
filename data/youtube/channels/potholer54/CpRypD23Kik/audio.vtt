00:00.000 --> 00:04.400
As I reported last month, Christopher Monckton backed out of a debate we were having on the

00:04.400 --> 00:06.280
website What's Up With That.

00:06.280 --> 00:10.500
Well, I'm still offering him the chance to continue the debate and provide the response

00:10.500 --> 00:13.680
he promised, but it'll be on a new site.

00:13.680 --> 00:19.120
I'll give details at the end of this video, but first I have to explain what's happened.

00:19.120 --> 00:22.620
Monckton's decision to pull the plug on the debate has been swiftly endorsed by the man

00:22.620 --> 00:26.800
who runs the What's Up With That site, Anthony Watts.

00:26.800 --> 00:31.000
I first got word of this not from Anthony, but from people who began commenting on it

00:31.000 --> 00:32.280
on my channel.

00:32.280 --> 00:36.640
It turns out he'd written this in the comments section of a Monckton guest post on What's

00:36.640 --> 00:38.100
Up With That.

00:38.100 --> 00:43.360
He was referring to an interview with me that Peter Sinclair, aka Green Man, had posted

00:43.360 --> 00:44.360
on his website.

00:44.360 --> 00:50.200
While I can't hear what Hadfield is saying, they seem totally infatuated with their manhunt,

00:50.200 --> 00:54.520
so much for Hadfield's repeated claims of being dispassionate and logical.

00:54.520 --> 00:56.000
Thanks for posting this.

00:56.000 --> 01:00.440
When he starts colluding with that hateful Green Man, all semblance of rational debate

01:00.440 --> 01:01.880
is destroyed.

01:01.880 --> 01:06.240
This video then cements my decision not to provide any further space to Hadfield here.

01:06.240 --> 01:10.240
Well, Anthony, I don't know if Sinclair is hateful or not.

01:10.240 --> 01:14.460
Sinclair emailed me very politely, asking if he could do an interview, and I saw no

01:14.460 --> 01:16.000
reason to refuse him.

01:16.000 --> 01:21.760
See, I'm not really interested in this rather silly us-versus-them catfight that so many

01:21.760 --> 01:25.440
people seem to think substitutes for a debate about the facts.

01:25.440 --> 01:27.400
I don't have hate lists.

01:27.400 --> 01:31.840
Everyone's welcome on my channel, whoever they are and whomever they talk to.

01:31.840 --> 01:35.440
But as I've said before, Anthony, you have a perfect right to run your channel as you

01:35.440 --> 01:41.280
see fit, to ban anyone you want and block any comments you don't like.

01:41.280 --> 01:44.740
As for the idea that we seem to be on a manhunt, even though you couldn't make out what was

01:44.740 --> 01:48.040
being said, I can assure you there is no manhunt.

01:48.040 --> 01:51.200
I'm not looking for Monckton, and it doesn't really matter where he is.

01:51.200 --> 01:55.560
All he has to do is post his promised response and answer the allegations that have been

01:55.560 --> 01:58.120
clearly laid out and documented.

01:58.120 --> 02:02.360
Perhaps instead of defending him, you should ask him why he doesn't do that.

02:02.360 --> 02:06.080
But I do have one beef, and that is with you making up quotes.

02:06.080 --> 02:10.000
I've never said I was dispassionate and logical.

02:10.000 --> 02:12.200
Not once, let alone repeatedly.

02:12.200 --> 02:16.040
Firstly, it sounds arrogant for me to make assertions like this.

02:16.040 --> 02:21.320
Secondly, whether the quote is flattering or not, making up quotes is simply wrong.

02:21.320 --> 02:26.600
Okay, I could explain why making up quotes is wrong, but this should be understood without

02:26.600 --> 02:27.920
having to have it explained.

02:27.920 --> 02:31.800
It's one of the first things they teach at journalism school, one of the first things

02:31.800 --> 02:37.320
academics learn when they do their research, and something even politicians realise.

02:37.320 --> 02:39.800
And this brings us back to the debate.

02:39.800 --> 02:44.520
Because Monckton, a politician, does know that his misquotes will be damaging to him,

02:44.520 --> 02:47.320
which is why he backed out of the debate.

02:47.320 --> 02:51.640
A few days after his comment was posted, I did get official word from Anthony Watts that

02:51.640 --> 02:53.640
he was pulling the plug on the debate.

02:53.640 --> 02:58.960
Oh well, I was delighted that Mr Watts had even allowed the debate to begin, given that

02:58.960 --> 03:03.840
so many of his readers, and even one of his moderators, professed themselves admirers

03:03.840 --> 03:05.200
of Monckton.

03:05.200 --> 03:08.080
It was a courageous act, and one that surprised me.

03:08.080 --> 03:12.240
So Anthony, I certainly don't take back my thanks to you for allowing your readers to

03:12.240 --> 03:16.680
glimpse some of Mr Monckton's sources that clearly contradict the claims he made for

03:16.680 --> 03:17.680
them.

03:17.680 --> 03:22.840
Fortunately, there are other internet sites that are willing to see a free and fair debate.

03:22.840 --> 03:27.840
I'm certainly willing to host one on my channel, and I've made that invitation to Mr Monckton.

03:27.840 --> 03:32.200
And I was approached by a website called the League of Reason for that same purpose.

03:32.200 --> 03:36.080
I've readily agreed for the debate to be hosted on their website.

03:36.080 --> 03:41.000
I understand they've also invited Mr Monckton, and asked him to send his promised response,

03:41.000 --> 03:43.600
which is now two months overdue.

03:43.600 --> 03:48.240
According to his supporters on what's up with that, Monckton can whip me easily.

03:48.240 --> 03:54.080
Great, if you think a debate about accurately quoting sources is a football game, then why

03:54.080 --> 03:54.880
doesn't he?
