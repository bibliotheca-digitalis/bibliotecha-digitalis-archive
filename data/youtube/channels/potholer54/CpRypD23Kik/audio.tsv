0	4400	As I reported last month, Christopher Monckton backed out of a debate we were having on the
4400	6280	website What's Up With That.
6280	10500	Well, I'm still offering him the chance to continue the debate and provide the response
10500	13680	he promised, but it'll be on a new site.
13680	19120	I'll give details at the end of this video, but first I have to explain what's happened.
19120	22620	Monckton's decision to pull the plug on the debate has been swiftly endorsed by the man
22620	26800	who runs the What's Up With That site, Anthony Watts.
26800	31000	I first got word of this not from Anthony, but from people who began commenting on it
31000	32280	on my channel.
32280	36640	It turns out he'd written this in the comments section of a Monckton guest post on What's
36640	38100	Up With That.
38100	43360	He was referring to an interview with me that Peter Sinclair, aka Green Man, had posted
43360	44360	on his website.
44360	50200	While I can't hear what Hadfield is saying, they seem totally infatuated with their manhunt,
50200	54520	so much for Hadfield's repeated claims of being dispassionate and logical.
54520	56000	Thanks for posting this.
56000	60440	When he starts colluding with that hateful Green Man, all semblance of rational debate
60440	61880	is destroyed.
61880	66240	This video then cements my decision not to provide any further space to Hadfield here.
66240	70240	Well, Anthony, I don't know if Sinclair is hateful or not.
70240	74460	Sinclair emailed me very politely, asking if he could do an interview, and I saw no
74460	76000	reason to refuse him.
76000	81760	See, I'm not really interested in this rather silly us-versus-them catfight that so many
81760	85440	people seem to think substitutes for a debate about the facts.
85440	87400	I don't have hate lists.
87400	91840	Everyone's welcome on my channel, whoever they are and whomever they talk to.
91840	95440	But as I've said before, Anthony, you have a perfect right to run your channel as you
95440	101280	see fit, to ban anyone you want and block any comments you don't like.
101280	104740	As for the idea that we seem to be on a manhunt, even though you couldn't make out what was
104740	108040	being said, I can assure you there is no manhunt.
108040	111200	I'm not looking for Monckton, and it doesn't really matter where he is.
111200	115560	All he has to do is post his promised response and answer the allegations that have been
115560	118120	clearly laid out and documented.
118120	122360	Perhaps instead of defending him, you should ask him why he doesn't do that.
122360	126080	But I do have one beef, and that is with you making up quotes.
126080	130000	I've never said I was dispassionate and logical.
130000	132200	Not once, let alone repeatedly.
132200	136040	Firstly, it sounds arrogant for me to make assertions like this.
136040	141320	Secondly, whether the quote is flattering or not, making up quotes is simply wrong.
141320	146600	Okay, I could explain why making up quotes is wrong, but this should be understood without
146600	147920	having to have it explained.
147920	151800	It's one of the first things they teach at journalism school, one of the first things
151800	157320	academics learn when they do their research, and something even politicians realise.
157320	159800	And this brings us back to the debate.
159800	164520	Because Monckton, a politician, does know that his misquotes will be damaging to him,
164520	167320	which is why he backed out of the debate.
167320	171640	A few days after his comment was posted, I did get official word from Anthony Watts that
171640	173640	he was pulling the plug on the debate.
173640	178960	Oh well, I was delighted that Mr Watts had even allowed the debate to begin, given that
178960	183840	so many of his readers, and even one of his moderators, professed themselves admirers
183840	185200	of Monckton.
185200	188080	It was a courageous act, and one that surprised me.
188080	192240	So Anthony, I certainly don't take back my thanks to you for allowing your readers to
192240	196680	glimpse some of Mr Monckton's sources that clearly contradict the claims he made for
196680	197680	them.
197680	202840	Fortunately, there are other internet sites that are willing to see a free and fair debate.
202840	207840	I'm certainly willing to host one on my channel, and I've made that invitation to Mr Monckton.
207840	212200	And I was approached by a website called the League of Reason for that same purpose.
212200	216080	I've readily agreed for the debate to be hosted on their website.
216080	221000	I understand they've also invited Mr Monckton, and asked him to send his promised response,
221000	223600	which is now two months overdue.
223600	228240	According to his supporters on what's up with that, Monckton can whip me easily.
228240	234080	Great, if you think a debate about accurately quoting sources is a football game, then why
234080	234880	doesn't he?
