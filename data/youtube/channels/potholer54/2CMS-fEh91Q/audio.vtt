My last video, Human Evolution Made Easy, showed how mitochondrial DNA can be used to

00:21.480 --> 00:27.840
trace our most recent common matrilineal female ancestor who lived about 150,000 years ago

00:27.840 --> 00:33.200
in Africa. But the same can be done for markers on the Y chromosome which are only passed

00:33.200 --> 00:39.000
from father to son. Our most recent common male ancestor also lived in Africa but much

00:39.000 --> 00:45.200
later, around 60,000 years ago. This video will look at what happened next and how we

00:45.200 --> 00:50.320
know that these ancestors migrated out of Africa and the routes they took to colonise

00:50.320 --> 00:56.040
the world. To understand that evidence we first need to understand these DNA markers.

00:56.080 --> 01:01.880
DNA consists of two intertwining strands which are basically joined up chemicals called nucleotides.

01:01.880 --> 01:07.400
Just four different types of nucleotide are found on each strand, adenine, thymine,

01:07.400 --> 01:13.640
cytosine and guanine. To glue the two strands together, adenine always pairs with thymine

01:13.640 --> 01:19.720
and cytosine always pairs with guanine. That's just the nature of their chemical bonds. When

01:19.720 --> 01:25.120
DNA copies itself, the copies aren't always perfect. So sometimes the wrong nucleotide

01:25.200 --> 01:30.960
will be put in place, in this case adenine instead of cytosine. If that isn't corrected,

01:30.960 --> 01:36.520
the pairing nucleotide will also be wrong. So you've got yourself a mutation, a marker.

01:36.520 --> 01:41.160
If the marker is on mitochondrial DNA, that marker will be passed down through every female

01:41.160 --> 01:46.440
descendant without alteration. If it's on Y chromosome DNA, it will be passed down through

01:46.440 --> 01:51.760
every male descendant without alteration. So if we find a marker in people today, we

01:51.760 --> 01:57.320
can trace it back through thousands of generations to find out when and where it started. Now

01:57.320 --> 02:03.040
imagine if all these people were migrating. This group stays put, this group moves north

02:03.040 --> 02:08.960
and in this group, headed east, a baby boy is born with a unique marker on his Y chromosome.

02:08.960 --> 02:14.200
The baby grows up and has male children who also carry the same marker. As the group continues

02:14.200 --> 02:19.640
its migration, some tribes settle and others keep moving eastwards. Like a leaky boat,

02:19.640 --> 02:24.900
the male movement leaves in its wake a trail of descendants with the red genetic marker.

02:24.900 --> 02:30.520
So by checking the DNA of people living today, we find those with the same genetic markers.

02:30.520 --> 02:35.800
This map shows the distribution of men with a marker on their Y chromosome called M130.

02:35.800 --> 02:40.280
We can wind this film backwards and follow the migration route they took, which was the

02:40.280 --> 02:46.120
first complete one out of Africa around 60,000 years ago. That was the basis for the study

02:46.120 --> 02:51.420
conducted by Spencer Wells and others in 2000, which involved collecting DNA samples

02:51.420 --> 02:56.440
from indigenous people all over the world. Wells found distinctive genetic markers and

02:56.440 --> 03:02.520
traced each back to its source, marked here by red circles. We're retracing the migration

03:02.520 --> 03:08.700
paths our ancestors took backwards through time and this is where they started once again

03:08.700 --> 03:14.520
in Africa. Because the mutations happen at a fairly regular rate, these ancestral markers

03:14.520 --> 03:20.960
can even be dated, so the time scale on this map marks the progress of each migration.

03:20.960 --> 03:25.120
Populations that stay put and don't migrate will, of course, have a lot more of these

03:25.120 --> 03:29.840
genetic markers. So it's not surprising that we find the greatest genetic diversity

03:29.840 --> 03:35.420
in Africa. But the greatest of all belongs to a people whose ancestral homeland once

03:35.420 --> 03:40.760
extended from South Africa to the Rift Valley. Wherever you're from in the world, whatever

03:40.760 --> 03:46.720
mitochondrial or Y chromosome DNA markers you have, you can trace your ancestry back

03:46.720 --> 03:52.800
to the people whose modern descendants are the San, the Bushmen, the living embodiment

03:52.800 --> 03:53.800
of all modern humans.

04:10.760 --> 04:26.320
The DNA evidence coincides perfectly with climatological evidence that shows these migrations

04:26.320 --> 04:31.840
occurred when East Africa was wetter and the Sahara was a savannah. Humans followed migrating

04:31.840 --> 04:37.720
herds across it. But when the climate became drier, the Sahara turned to desert. Effectively,

04:37.720 --> 04:42.840
climate slammed shut like a gate. When the Saharan climate improved again, DNA evidence,

04:42.840 --> 04:49.000
coincidentally, shows a second great migration. This was the big one. Our ancestors moved

04:49.000 --> 04:54.820
into the heart of Europe and Asia, then later across a land bridge into the Americas. Wherever

04:54.820 --> 05:00.220
they went, humans adapted to the climate and new diets. People moving into northern climates

05:00.220 --> 05:06.320
lost the melanin in their skins. Melanin inhibits the production of vitamin D by sunlight. That's

05:06.320 --> 05:12.360
no problem in sunny Africa, but a drawback in northern latitudes. As long as they were

05:12.360 --> 05:17.000
moving and opening up new territory, there was plenty of space for excess populations

05:17.000 --> 05:23.880
to expand. But around 20,000 years ago, the human diaspora had filled nearly every continent.

05:23.880 --> 05:28.680
Settled populations began to grow. What we learned in primary school is that Stone Age

05:28.680 --> 05:33.960
humans were hunter-gatherers living in small tribes, then all of a sudden they discovered

05:33.960 --> 05:38.840
farming, settled down, built towns and invented writing. But if humans had been around for

05:38.840 --> 05:43.520
over 100,000 years, why did they suddenly become civilised in different parts of the

05:43.520 --> 05:49.760
world at the same time? Archaeologists don't see civilisation as something that appeared

05:49.760 --> 05:55.280
out of the blue, like a light suddenly banishing the darkness of the Stone Age. Instead, they

05:55.280 --> 06:00.620
see increasingly complex and hierarchical societies. In Europe and the Middle East,

06:00.620 --> 06:05.220
people were living in semi-permanent settlements 20,000 years before the first pyramids were

06:05.220 --> 06:11.540
built and 12,000 years before farming was discovered. They had art, culture, religion,

06:11.540 --> 06:17.100
medicine and a growing technology. They mass produced beads and mined obsidian and flint

06:17.100 --> 06:23.100
for export, then transported them over extensive trading routes. They criss-crossed the Mediterranean

06:23.100 --> 06:28.580
in trading boats and far from having lives that were nasty, brutish and short, most of

06:28.580 --> 06:34.500
them lived to be grandparents and enjoyed healthy food surpluses. Even 6,000 years before

06:34.500 --> 06:40.380
farming was introduced, people in northern Mesopotamia were living in sophisticated settlements.

06:40.380 --> 06:45.640
This is a temple complex dating back 11,000 years. Further south, the people called the

06:45.640 --> 06:51.140
Natufians were also living in permanent villages and there's evidence they stored grain. But

06:51.140 --> 06:56.780
then came the next big change. In the Middle East, the climate dried. Whether people began

06:56.780 --> 07:01.500
planting crops because they'd become scarce in the wild or whether scattered populations

07:01.500 --> 07:07.100
had to congregate around oases and rivers because water was scarce, whatever the case,

07:07.100 --> 07:11.860
farming seems to have begun out of necessity. Over several hundred years, it took hold in

07:11.860 --> 07:17.540
Mesopotamia and the Yellow River Valley, apparently independently. It took a thousand more years

07:17.540 --> 07:22.620
for the practice to spread via trade routes to the Indus Valley, the Nile Valley and other

07:22.620 --> 07:29.020
parts of Eurasia. But the payoff from farming was huge. It opened the way for larger settlements,

07:29.020 --> 07:35.740
technological innovation and accelerated trade and writing. The motivation of these megalithic

07:35.740 --> 07:40.980
and neolithic people may always be debatable, but nothing contradicts the hard evidence

07:40.980 --> 07:47.460
of DNA. Tracing our ancestry uses exactly the same techniques used in determining paternity

07:47.460 --> 07:53.020
and convicting criminals. The DNA evidence also fits perfectly with the climatological

07:53.020 --> 07:59.420
and archaeological evidence. We have a lot more to learn, but we do at least know how

07:59.420 --> 08:05.500
we got here. And so we come to the present day, having traced our origins in this series

08:05.500 --> 08:11.300
all the way from the Big Bang. Of course, to use a cliche, this is all ancient history.

08:11.300 --> 08:15.600
But to those with a yearning to know who they are and where they came from, it's a history

08:15.600 --> 08:21.280
that made us who we are. To understand that, just look at Britain's oldest complete skeleton,

08:21.280 --> 08:28.360
9,000-year-old Cheddar Man. In 1997, DNA was taken from the skeleton and compared to people

08:28.360 --> 08:33.820
from the area. They discovered one of Cheddar Man's direct descendants, a schoolteacher

08:33.820 --> 08:36.720
living just half a mile from where the skeleton was found.
