0	21480	My last video, Human Evolution Made Easy, showed how mitochondrial DNA can be used to
21480	27840	trace our most recent common matrilineal female ancestor who lived about 150,000 years ago
27840	33200	in Africa. But the same can be done for markers on the Y chromosome which are only passed
33200	39000	from father to son. Our most recent common male ancestor also lived in Africa but much
39000	45200	later, around 60,000 years ago. This video will look at what happened next and how we
45200	50320	know that these ancestors migrated out of Africa and the routes they took to colonise
50320	56040	the world. To understand that evidence we first need to understand these DNA markers.
56080	61880	DNA consists of two intertwining strands which are basically joined up chemicals called nucleotides.
61880	67400	Just four different types of nucleotide are found on each strand, adenine, thymine,
67400	73640	cytosine and guanine. To glue the two strands together, adenine always pairs with thymine
73640	79720	and cytosine always pairs with guanine. That's just the nature of their chemical bonds. When
79720	85120	DNA copies itself, the copies aren't always perfect. So sometimes the wrong nucleotide
85200	90960	will be put in place, in this case adenine instead of cytosine. If that isn't corrected,
90960	96520	the pairing nucleotide will also be wrong. So you've got yourself a mutation, a marker.
96520	101160	If the marker is on mitochondrial DNA, that marker will be passed down through every female
101160	106440	descendant without alteration. If it's on Y chromosome DNA, it will be passed down through
106440	111760	every male descendant without alteration. So if we find a marker in people today, we
111760	117320	can trace it back through thousands of generations to find out when and where it started. Now
117320	123040	imagine if all these people were migrating. This group stays put, this group moves north
123040	128960	and in this group, headed east, a baby boy is born with a unique marker on his Y chromosome.
128960	134200	The baby grows up and has male children who also carry the same marker. As the group continues
134200	139640	its migration, some tribes settle and others keep moving eastwards. Like a leaky boat,
139640	144900	the male movement leaves in its wake a trail of descendants with the red genetic marker.
144900	150520	So by checking the DNA of people living today, we find those with the same genetic markers.
150520	155800	This map shows the distribution of men with a marker on their Y chromosome called M130.
155800	160280	We can wind this film backwards and follow the migration route they took, which was the
160280	166120	first complete one out of Africa around 60,000 years ago. That was the basis for the study
166120	171420	conducted by Spencer Wells and others in 2000, which involved collecting DNA samples
171420	176440	from indigenous people all over the world. Wells found distinctive genetic markers and
176440	182520	traced each back to its source, marked here by red circles. We're retracing the migration
182520	188700	paths our ancestors took backwards through time and this is where they started once again
188700	194520	in Africa. Because the mutations happen at a fairly regular rate, these ancestral markers
194520	200960	can even be dated, so the time scale on this map marks the progress of each migration.
200960	205120	Populations that stay put and don't migrate will, of course, have a lot more of these
205120	209840	genetic markers. So it's not surprising that we find the greatest genetic diversity
209840	215420	in Africa. But the greatest of all belongs to a people whose ancestral homeland once
215420	220760	extended from South Africa to the Rift Valley. Wherever you're from in the world, whatever
220760	226720	mitochondrial or Y chromosome DNA markers you have, you can trace your ancestry back
226720	232800	to the people whose modern descendants are the San, the Bushmen, the living embodiment
232800	233800	of all modern humans.
250760	266320	The DNA evidence coincides perfectly with climatological evidence that shows these migrations
266320	271840	occurred when East Africa was wetter and the Sahara was a savannah. Humans followed migrating
271840	277720	herds across it. But when the climate became drier, the Sahara turned to desert. Effectively,
277720	282840	climate slammed shut like a gate. When the Saharan climate improved again, DNA evidence,
282840	289000	coincidentally, shows a second great migration. This was the big one. Our ancestors moved
289000	294820	into the heart of Europe and Asia, then later across a land bridge into the Americas. Wherever
294820	300220	they went, humans adapted to the climate and new diets. People moving into northern climates
300220	306320	lost the melanin in their skins. Melanin inhibits the production of vitamin D by sunlight. That's
306320	312360	no problem in sunny Africa, but a drawback in northern latitudes. As long as they were
312360	317000	moving and opening up new territory, there was plenty of space for excess populations
317000	323880	to expand. But around 20,000 years ago, the human diaspora had filled nearly every continent.
323880	328680	Settled populations began to grow. What we learned in primary school is that Stone Age
328680	333960	humans were hunter-gatherers living in small tribes, then all of a sudden they discovered
333960	338840	farming, settled down, built towns and invented writing. But if humans had been around for
338840	343520	over 100,000 years, why did they suddenly become civilised in different parts of the
343520	349760	world at the same time? Archaeologists don't see civilisation as something that appeared
349760	355280	out of the blue, like a light suddenly banishing the darkness of the Stone Age. Instead, they
355280	360620	see increasingly complex and hierarchical societies. In Europe and the Middle East,
360620	365220	people were living in semi-permanent settlements 20,000 years before the first pyramids were
365220	371540	built and 12,000 years before farming was discovered. They had art, culture, religion,
371540	377100	medicine and a growing technology. They mass produced beads and mined obsidian and flint
377100	383100	for export, then transported them over extensive trading routes. They criss-crossed the Mediterranean
383100	388580	in trading boats and far from having lives that were nasty, brutish and short, most of
388580	394500	them lived to be grandparents and enjoyed healthy food surpluses. Even 6,000 years before
394500	400380	farming was introduced, people in northern Mesopotamia were living in sophisticated settlements.
400380	405640	This is a temple complex dating back 11,000 years. Further south, the people called the
405640	411140	Natufians were also living in permanent villages and there's evidence they stored grain. But
411140	416780	then came the next big change. In the Middle East, the climate dried. Whether people began
416780	421500	planting crops because they'd become scarce in the wild or whether scattered populations
421500	427100	had to congregate around oases and rivers because water was scarce, whatever the case,
427100	431860	farming seems to have begun out of necessity. Over several hundred years, it took hold in
431860	437540	Mesopotamia and the Yellow River Valley, apparently independently. It took a thousand more years
437540	442620	for the practice to spread via trade routes to the Indus Valley, the Nile Valley and other
442620	449020	parts of Eurasia. But the payoff from farming was huge. It opened the way for larger settlements,
449020	455740	technological innovation and accelerated trade and writing. The motivation of these megalithic
455740	460980	and neolithic people may always be debatable, but nothing contradicts the hard evidence
460980	467460	of DNA. Tracing our ancestry uses exactly the same techniques used in determining paternity
467460	473020	and convicting criminals. The DNA evidence also fits perfectly with the climatological
473020	479420	and archaeological evidence. We have a lot more to learn, but we do at least know how
479420	485500	we got here. And so we come to the present day, having traced our origins in this series
485500	491300	all the way from the Big Bang. Of course, to use a cliche, this is all ancient history.
491300	495600	But to those with a yearning to know who they are and where they came from, it's a history
495600	501280	that made us who we are. To understand that, just look at Britain's oldest complete skeleton,
501280	508360	9,000-year-old Cheddar Man. In 1997, DNA was taken from the skeleton and compared to people
508360	513820	from the area. They discovered one of Cheddar Man's direct descendants, a schoolteacher
513820	516720	living just half a mile from where the skeleton was found.
