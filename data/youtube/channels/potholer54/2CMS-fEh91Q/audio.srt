00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:21,480
My last video, Human Evolution Made Easy, showed how mitochondrial DNA can be used to

2
00:00:21,480 --> 00:00:27,840
trace our most recent common matrilineal female ancestor who lived about 150,000 years ago

3
00:00:27,840 --> 00:00:33,200
in Africa. But the same can be done for markers on the Y chromosome which are only passed

4
00:00:33,200 --> 00:00:39,000
from father to son. Our most recent common male ancestor also lived in Africa but much

5
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:45,200
later, around 60,000 years ago. This video will look at what happened next and how we

6
00:00:45,200 --> 00:00:50,320
know that these ancestors migrated out of Africa and the routes they took to colonise

7
00:00:50,320 --> 00:00:56,040
the world. To understand that evidence we first need to understand these DNA markers.

8
00:00:56,080 --> 00:01:01,880
DNA consists of two intertwining strands which are basically joined up chemicals called nucleotides.

9
00:01:01,880 --> 00:01:07,400
Just four different types of nucleotide are found on each strand, adenine, thymine,

10
00:01:07,400 --> 00:01:13,640
cytosine and guanine. To glue the two strands together, adenine always pairs with thymine

11
00:01:13,640 --> 00:01:19,720
and cytosine always pairs with guanine. That's just the nature of their chemical bonds. When

12
00:01:19,720 --> 00:01:25,120
DNA copies itself, the copies aren't always perfect. So sometimes the wrong nucleotide

13
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:30,960
will be put in place, in this case adenine instead of cytosine. If that isn't corrected,

14
00:01:30,960 --> 00:01:36,520
the pairing nucleotide will also be wrong. So you've got yourself a mutation, a marker.

15
00:01:36,520 --> 00:01:41,160
If the marker is on mitochondrial DNA, that marker will be passed down through every female

16
00:01:41,160 --> 00:01:46,440
descendant without alteration. If it's on Y chromosome DNA, it will be passed down through

17
00:01:46,440 --> 00:01:51,760
every male descendant without alteration. So if we find a marker in people today, we

18
00:01:51,760 --> 00:01:57,320
can trace it back through thousands of generations to find out when and where it started. Now

19
00:01:57,320 --> 00:02:03,040
imagine if all these people were migrating. This group stays put, this group moves north

20
00:02:03,040 --> 00:02:08,960
and in this group, headed east, a baby boy is born with a unique marker on his Y chromosome.

21
00:02:08,960 --> 00:02:14,200
The baby grows up and has male children who also carry the same marker. As the group continues

22
00:02:14,200 --> 00:02:19,640
its migration, some tribes settle and others keep moving eastwards. Like a leaky boat,

23
00:02:19,640 --> 00:02:24,900
the male movement leaves in its wake a trail of descendants with the red genetic marker.

24
00:02:24,900 --> 00:02:30,520
So by checking the DNA of people living today, we find those with the same genetic markers.

25
00:02:30,520 --> 00:02:35,800
This map shows the distribution of men with a marker on their Y chromosome called M130.

26
00:02:35,800 --> 00:02:40,280
We can wind this film backwards and follow the migration route they took, which was the

27
00:02:40,280 --> 00:02:46,120
first complete one out of Africa around 60,000 years ago. That was the basis for the study

28
00:02:46,120 --> 00:02:51,420
conducted by Spencer Wells and others in 2000, which involved collecting DNA samples

29
00:02:51,420 --> 00:02:56,440
from indigenous people all over the world. Wells found distinctive genetic markers and

30
00:02:56,440 --> 00:03:02,520
traced each back to its source, marked here by red circles. We're retracing the migration

31
00:03:02,520 --> 00:03:08,700
paths our ancestors took backwards through time and this is where they started once again

32
00:03:08,700 --> 00:03:14,520
in Africa. Because the mutations happen at a fairly regular rate, these ancestral markers

33
00:03:14,520 --> 00:03:20,960
can even be dated, so the time scale on this map marks the progress of each migration.

34
00:03:20,960 --> 00:03:25,120
Populations that stay put and don't migrate will, of course, have a lot more of these

35
00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:29,840
genetic markers. So it's not surprising that we find the greatest genetic diversity

36
00:03:29,840 --> 00:03:35,420
in Africa. But the greatest of all belongs to a people whose ancestral homeland once

37
00:03:35,420 --> 00:03:40,760
extended from South Africa to the Rift Valley. Wherever you're from in the world, whatever

38
00:03:40,760 --> 00:03:46,720
mitochondrial or Y chromosome DNA markers you have, you can trace your ancestry back

39
00:03:46,720 --> 00:03:52,800
to the people whose modern descendants are the San, the Bushmen, the living embodiment

40
00:03:52,800 --> 00:03:53,800
of all modern humans.

41
00:04:10,760 --> 00:04:26,320
The DNA evidence coincides perfectly with climatological evidence that shows these migrations

42
00:04:26,320 --> 00:04:31,840
occurred when East Africa was wetter and the Sahara was a savannah. Humans followed migrating

43
00:04:31,840 --> 00:04:37,720
herds across it. But when the climate became drier, the Sahara turned to desert. Effectively,

44
00:04:37,720 --> 00:04:42,840
climate slammed shut like a gate. When the Saharan climate improved again, DNA evidence,

45
00:04:42,840 --> 00:04:49,000
coincidentally, shows a second great migration. This was the big one. Our ancestors moved

46
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:54,820
into the heart of Europe and Asia, then later across a land bridge into the Americas. Wherever

47
00:04:54,820 --> 00:05:00,220
they went, humans adapted to the climate and new diets. People moving into northern climates

48
00:05:00,220 --> 00:05:06,320
lost the melanin in their skins. Melanin inhibits the production of vitamin D by sunlight. That's

49
00:05:06,320 --> 00:05:12,360
no problem in sunny Africa, but a drawback in northern latitudes. As long as they were

50
00:05:12,360 --> 00:05:17,000
moving and opening up new territory, there was plenty of space for excess populations

51
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:23,880
to expand. But around 20,000 years ago, the human diaspora had filled nearly every continent.

52
00:05:23,880 --> 00:05:28,680
Settled populations began to grow. What we learned in primary school is that Stone Age

53
00:05:28,680 --> 00:05:33,960
humans were hunter-gatherers living in small tribes, then all of a sudden they discovered

54
00:05:33,960 --> 00:05:38,840
farming, settled down, built towns and invented writing. But if humans had been around for

55
00:05:38,840 --> 00:05:43,520
over 100,000 years, why did they suddenly become civilised in different parts of the

56
00:05:43,520 --> 00:05:49,760
world at the same time? Archaeologists don't see civilisation as something that appeared

57
00:05:49,760 --> 00:05:55,280
out of the blue, like a light suddenly banishing the darkness of the Stone Age. Instead, they

58
00:05:55,280 --> 00:06:00,620
see increasingly complex and hierarchical societies. In Europe and the Middle East,

59
00:06:00,620 --> 00:06:05,220
people were living in semi-permanent settlements 20,000 years before the first pyramids were

60
00:06:05,220 --> 00:06:11,540
built and 12,000 years before farming was discovered. They had art, culture, religion,

61
00:06:11,540 --> 00:06:17,100
medicine and a growing technology. They mass produced beads and mined obsidian and flint

62
00:06:17,100 --> 00:06:23,100
for export, then transported them over extensive trading routes. They criss-crossed the Mediterranean

63
00:06:23,100 --> 00:06:28,580
in trading boats and far from having lives that were nasty, brutish and short, most of

64
00:06:28,580 --> 00:06:34,500
them lived to be grandparents and enjoyed healthy food surpluses. Even 6,000 years before

65
00:06:34,500 --> 00:06:40,380
farming was introduced, people in northern Mesopotamia were living in sophisticated settlements.

66
00:06:40,380 --> 00:06:45,640
This is a temple complex dating back 11,000 years. Further south, the people called the

67
00:06:45,640 --> 00:06:51,140
Natufians were also living in permanent villages and there's evidence they stored grain. But

68
00:06:51,140 --> 00:06:56,780
then came the next big change. In the Middle East, the climate dried. Whether people began

69
00:06:56,780 --> 00:07:01,500
planting crops because they'd become scarce in the wild or whether scattered populations

70
00:07:01,500 --> 00:07:07,100
had to congregate around oases and rivers because water was scarce, whatever the case,

71
00:07:07,100 --> 00:07:11,860
farming seems to have begun out of necessity. Over several hundred years, it took hold in

72
00:07:11,860 --> 00:07:17,540
Mesopotamia and the Yellow River Valley, apparently independently. It took a thousand more years

73
00:07:17,540 --> 00:07:22,620
for the practice to spread via trade routes to the Indus Valley, the Nile Valley and other

74
00:07:22,620 --> 00:07:29,020
parts of Eurasia. But the payoff from farming was huge. It opened the way for larger settlements,

75
00:07:29,020 --> 00:07:35,740
technological innovation and accelerated trade and writing. The motivation of these megalithic

76
00:07:35,740 --> 00:07:40,980
and neolithic people may always be debatable, but nothing contradicts the hard evidence

77
00:07:40,980 --> 00:07:47,460
of DNA. Tracing our ancestry uses exactly the same techniques used in determining paternity

78
00:07:47,460 --> 00:07:53,020
and convicting criminals. The DNA evidence also fits perfectly with the climatological

79
00:07:53,020 --> 00:07:59,420
and archaeological evidence. We have a lot more to learn, but we do at least know how

80
00:07:59,420 --> 00:08:05,500
we got here. And so we come to the present day, having traced our origins in this series

81
00:08:05,500 --> 00:08:11,300
all the way from the Big Bang. Of course, to use a cliche, this is all ancient history.

82
00:08:11,300 --> 00:08:15,600
But to those with a yearning to know who they are and where they came from, it's a history

83
00:08:15,600 --> 00:08:21,280
that made us who we are. To understand that, just look at Britain's oldest complete skeleton,

84
00:08:21,280 --> 00:08:28,360
9,000-year-old Cheddar Man. In 1997, DNA was taken from the skeleton and compared to people

85
00:08:28,360 --> 00:08:33,820
from the area. They discovered one of Cheddar Man's direct descendants, a schoolteacher

86
00:08:33,820 --> 00:08:36,720
living just half a mile from where the skeleton was found.
