00:00.000 --> 00:05.280
Another mole has popped up, and after receiving several messages about a paper that finally

00:05.280 --> 00:10.100
settles the science of climate change, I thought it deserved to be whacked down and put in

00:10.100 --> 00:11.460
perspective.

00:11.460 --> 00:16.300
The latest urban myth to do the rounds of the internet is based on a paper by researchers

00:16.300 --> 00:20.380
from CERN, the European Particle Accelerator.

00:20.380 --> 00:25.220
Now I could read the paper, they wrote, but why bother going through all that sciencey

00:25.220 --> 00:30.300
stuff when a thousand internet bloggers don't need to read the paper in order to tell you

00:30.300 --> 00:32.580
everything it says?

00:32.580 --> 00:37.300
According to Newsroom America, researchers at CERN have concluded that global warming

00:37.300 --> 00:39.460
is caused by the sun.

00:39.460 --> 00:41.260
How do I know that's true?

00:41.260 --> 00:46.780
Because it's confirmed by NaturalNews.com and countless other blogs, and of course by

00:46.780 --> 00:49.920
James Delingpole at the Daily Telegraph.

00:49.920 --> 00:55.180
As Delingpole himself admits, he doesn't read scientific papers, but if it's on the internet,

00:55.220 --> 01:01.420
and Delingpole believes it and repeats it, then that's confirmation that it must be true.

01:01.420 --> 01:05.260
The other conclusion that can be drawn from the paper, without actually having to read

01:05.260 --> 01:09.140
it, is that it now settles the science on climate change.

01:09.140 --> 01:14.520
The paper apparently has convincing new evidence that cosmic rays and the sun are the controllers

01:14.520 --> 01:18.340
of the Earth's climate, and that's settled.

01:18.340 --> 01:23.620
But before I go, look, I hate to do this to you, but I am going to have to show you the

01:23.620 --> 01:28.020
paper that all this hyperbole and hysteria is supposed to be based on.

01:28.020 --> 01:33.300
I know, it's tedious to actually check a source and read all that boring science, but let's

01:33.300 --> 01:38.000
see if the paper says what the bloggers think it ought to say.

01:38.000 --> 01:40.580
Let's start with what it doesn't say.

01:40.580 --> 01:46.140
It doesn't say the sun is responsible for global warming, or anything like it.

01:46.140 --> 01:51.120
Maybe Newsroom America copied the quote from James Delingpole's column, but he didn't get

01:51.120 --> 01:56.640
it from the paper, he got it from another journalist and blogger, Lawrence Solomon.

01:56.640 --> 02:02.440
Solomon also seems to think the findings point to cosmic rays and the sun, not human activities,

02:02.440 --> 02:04.840
as the controller of climate on Earth.

02:04.840 --> 02:08.320
But the paper says nothing of the sort.

02:08.320 --> 02:10.520
So what does the paper say?

02:10.520 --> 02:15.600
Well, sorry bloggers, but to find out, you actually have to read it, instead of just

02:15.600 --> 02:18.680
copying and quoting off each other.

02:18.720 --> 02:23.560
The research is in response to a hypothesis by the Danish researcher Henrik Svensmark

02:23.560 --> 02:29.480
that cosmic rays could bring together, or nucleate, aerosol particles in the atmosphere,

02:29.480 --> 02:32.400
and that they could seed more clouds.

02:32.400 --> 02:36.920
Svensmark postulates that more clouds might cause cooling, but let's not get ahead of

02:36.920 --> 02:37.920
ourselves.

02:37.920 --> 02:43.080
What the researchers at CERN confirmed was that cosmic rays can nucleate small particles

02:43.080 --> 02:45.060
in the atmosphere.

02:45.060 --> 02:49.080
This is a very interesting piece of research, but it's a long way from showing that cosmic

02:49.080 --> 02:51.900
rays drive the Earth's climate.

02:51.900 --> 02:56.460
If we believe Newsroom America, however, scientists were able to demonstrate that cosmic rays

02:56.460 --> 03:01.120
can form molecules that then grow seed clouds inside the atmosphere.

03:01.120 --> 03:05.400
In fact, the researchers specifically stated that they didn't demonstrate this.

03:05.400 --> 03:10.380
They wrote that because the nucleated particles produced in the experiment were quite small,

03:10.380 --> 03:14.900
it's not clear what fraction would grow large enough to seed cloud droplets.

03:14.900 --> 03:19.000
And if they could seed clouds, would this be significant compared to the amount of cloud

03:19.000 --> 03:20.600
that's already up there?

03:20.600 --> 03:25.040
And if it is significant, what does that mean for atmospheric temperatures?

03:25.040 --> 03:27.020
Clouds have a dual role in climate.

03:27.020 --> 03:31.620
They reflect sunlight back into space and therefore have a negative cooling effect,

03:31.620 --> 03:36.540
but they also prevent heat from escaping and therefore have a positive warming effect.

03:36.540 --> 03:40.940
The cooling effect is greater in clouds near the ground, and at the equator, the warming

03:40.940 --> 03:45.220
effect is greater in clouds higher up and at greater latitudes.

03:45.220 --> 03:49.780
So even if it could be conclusively shown that there is a slight cooling, how much of

03:49.780 --> 03:55.940
a mitigating effect would that have on the warming caused by increased carbon dioxide?

03:55.940 --> 04:00.320
But these questions and uncertainties aren't the reason climatologists have rejected the

04:00.320 --> 04:02.620
cosmic ray hypothesis.

04:02.620 --> 04:07.620
They've rejected it for a much simpler reason, because if cosmic rays do have an effect on

04:07.620 --> 04:12.780
the temperature of the Earth, then we'd expect to see that in the climate record.

04:12.780 --> 04:17.380
Cosmic rays have been stable for the last 35 years, just as solar irradiance has been

04:17.380 --> 04:22.300
stable, so they can't account for the warming we've been seeing over that period.

04:22.300 --> 04:27.420
In short, cosmic rays and global temperatures can be measured over time, and they don't

04:27.420 --> 04:29.520
match up.

04:29.520 --> 04:33.580
So while the CERN researchers advance our knowledge of the way cosmic rays interact

04:33.580 --> 04:37.940
with the atmosphere, they didn't do any experiments to determine what effect this

04:37.940 --> 04:43.540
has on cloud cover, or what effect cloud cover has on global temperatures.

04:43.540 --> 04:48.020
Which brings us on to the next myth concerning this paper, that CERN Director-General Rolf

04:48.020 --> 04:53.700
Dieter Heuer said scientists should refrain from drawing conclusions from the experiment.

04:53.700 --> 04:58.460
This obviously makes no sense, as one discerning YouTuber surmised,

04:59.460 --> 05:16.660
The first thing that's obvious is that the paper did draw a conclusion that cosmic rays can nucleate aerosols.

05:16.660 --> 05:22.480
This is what the experiment was designed to find out, and what it demonstrated very clearly.

05:22.480 --> 05:27.460
What Heuer actually said, if we read the source of his comments in De Welt, is that the researchers

05:27.460 --> 05:30.340
shouldn't interpret the results.

05:30.340 --> 05:35.060
Nigel Calder, one of the few bloggers who actually did read the paper, thinks the implication

05:35.060 --> 05:40.720
of Heuer's words was that researchers should on no account endorse the Danish heresy, Henrik

05:40.720 --> 05:45.620
Svensmark's hypothesis that most of the global warming of the 20th century can be explained

05:45.620 --> 05:50.840
by the reduction in cosmic rays due to livelier solar activity, resulting in less low cloud

05:50.840 --> 05:53.740
cover and warmer surface temperatures.

05:53.740 --> 05:59.260
But if this is what he meant, there's a very good reason why his advice is spot on.

05:59.260 --> 06:03.940
The CERN scientists didn't do any research into how clouds affect global temperature

06:03.940 --> 06:10.140
or into any link between cosmic rays and climate during the 20th century, so how can they speculate

06:10.140 --> 06:15.260
on what the results might have been for an experiment they didn't do?

06:15.260 --> 06:19.820
And if they speculated that the global warming of the 20th century can be explained by the

06:19.820 --> 06:24.520
reduction in cosmic rays due to livelier solar activity, their paper would have been

06:24.520 --> 06:28.620
rejected by nature as undergraduate claptrap.

06:28.620 --> 06:32.500
Because they have no evidence for this at all, since they didn't do any experiments

06:32.500 --> 06:37.020
on this, they would have had to go to other papers that show that solar activity isn't

06:37.020 --> 06:42.600
livelier, it's been very stable for half a century, and cosmic rays haven't been reduced

06:42.600 --> 06:47.380
in activity, they follow the stable pattern of 11 year solar cycles.

06:47.380 --> 06:52.400
If the researchers had to take anyone's advice, and I doubt they needed to anyway, it would

06:52.400 --> 06:58.100
have been Hoyer's to stick with what the results show, rather than Calder's to go on a wild

06:58.100 --> 07:02.980
speculative romp that flies in the face of observations.

07:02.980 --> 07:07.060
Speculation without evidence wouldn't be published in one of the most prestigious journals in

07:07.060 --> 07:09.340
science, it would end up on a blog.
