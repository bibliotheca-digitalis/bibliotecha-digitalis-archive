0	5280	Another mole has popped up, and after receiving several messages about a paper that finally
5280	10100	settles the science of climate change, I thought it deserved to be whacked down and put in
10100	11460	perspective.
11460	16300	The latest urban myth to do the rounds of the internet is based on a paper by researchers
16300	20380	from CERN, the European Particle Accelerator.
20380	25220	Now I could read the paper, they wrote, but why bother going through all that sciencey
25220	30300	stuff when a thousand internet bloggers don't need to read the paper in order to tell you
30300	32580	everything it says?
32580	37300	According to Newsroom America, researchers at CERN have concluded that global warming
37300	39460	is caused by the sun.
39460	41260	How do I know that's true?
41260	46780	Because it's confirmed by NaturalNews.com and countless other blogs, and of course by
46780	49920	James Delingpole at the Daily Telegraph.
49920	55180	As Delingpole himself admits, he doesn't read scientific papers, but if it's on the internet,
55220	61420	and Delingpole believes it and repeats it, then that's confirmation that it must be true.
61420	65260	The other conclusion that can be drawn from the paper, without actually having to read
65260	69140	it, is that it now settles the science on climate change.
69140	74520	The paper apparently has convincing new evidence that cosmic rays and the sun are the controllers
74520	78340	of the Earth's climate, and that's settled.
78340	83620	But before I go, look, I hate to do this to you, but I am going to have to show you the
83620	88020	paper that all this hyperbole and hysteria is supposed to be based on.
88020	93300	I know, it's tedious to actually check a source and read all that boring science, but let's
93300	98000	see if the paper says what the bloggers think it ought to say.
98000	100580	Let's start with what it doesn't say.
100580	106140	It doesn't say the sun is responsible for global warming, or anything like it.
106140	111120	Maybe Newsroom America copied the quote from James Delingpole's column, but he didn't get
111120	116640	it from the paper, he got it from another journalist and blogger, Lawrence Solomon.
116640	122440	Solomon also seems to think the findings point to cosmic rays and the sun, not human activities,
122440	124840	as the controller of climate on Earth.
124840	128320	But the paper says nothing of the sort.
128320	130520	So what does the paper say?
130520	135600	Well, sorry bloggers, but to find out, you actually have to read it, instead of just
135600	138680	copying and quoting off each other.
138720	143560	The research is in response to a hypothesis by the Danish researcher Henrik Svensmark
143560	149480	that cosmic rays could bring together, or nucleate, aerosol particles in the atmosphere,
149480	152400	and that they could seed more clouds.
152400	156920	Svensmark postulates that more clouds might cause cooling, but let's not get ahead of
156920	157920	ourselves.
157920	163080	What the researchers at CERN confirmed was that cosmic rays can nucleate small particles
163080	165060	in the atmosphere.
165060	169080	This is a very interesting piece of research, but it's a long way from showing that cosmic
169080	171900	rays drive the Earth's climate.
171900	176460	If we believe Newsroom America, however, scientists were able to demonstrate that cosmic rays
176460	181120	can form molecules that then grow seed clouds inside the atmosphere.
181120	185400	In fact, the researchers specifically stated that they didn't demonstrate this.
185400	190380	They wrote that because the nucleated particles produced in the experiment were quite small,
190380	194900	it's not clear what fraction would grow large enough to seed cloud droplets.
194900	199000	And if they could seed clouds, would this be significant compared to the amount of cloud
199000	200600	that's already up there?
200600	205040	And if it is significant, what does that mean for atmospheric temperatures?
205040	207020	Clouds have a dual role in climate.
207020	211620	They reflect sunlight back into space and therefore have a negative cooling effect,
211620	216540	but they also prevent heat from escaping and therefore have a positive warming effect.
216540	220940	The cooling effect is greater in clouds near the ground, and at the equator, the warming
220940	225220	effect is greater in clouds higher up and at greater latitudes.
225220	229780	So even if it could be conclusively shown that there is a slight cooling, how much of
229780	235940	a mitigating effect would that have on the warming caused by increased carbon dioxide?
235940	240320	But these questions and uncertainties aren't the reason climatologists have rejected the
240320	242620	cosmic ray hypothesis.
242620	247620	They've rejected it for a much simpler reason, because if cosmic rays do have an effect on
247620	252780	the temperature of the Earth, then we'd expect to see that in the climate record.
252780	257380	Cosmic rays have been stable for the last 35 years, just as solar irradiance has been
257380	262300	stable, so they can't account for the warming we've been seeing over that period.
262300	267420	In short, cosmic rays and global temperatures can be measured over time, and they don't
267420	269520	match up.
269520	273580	So while the CERN researchers advance our knowledge of the way cosmic rays interact
273580	277940	with the atmosphere, they didn't do any experiments to determine what effect this
277940	283540	has on cloud cover, or what effect cloud cover has on global temperatures.
283540	288020	Which brings us on to the next myth concerning this paper, that CERN Director-General Rolf
288020	293700	Dieter Heuer said scientists should refrain from drawing conclusions from the experiment.
293700	298460	This obviously makes no sense, as one discerning YouTuber surmised,
299460	316660	The first thing that's obvious is that the paper did draw a conclusion that cosmic rays can nucleate aerosols.
316660	322480	This is what the experiment was designed to find out, and what it demonstrated very clearly.
322480	327460	What Heuer actually said, if we read the source of his comments in De Welt, is that the researchers
327460	330340	shouldn't interpret the results.
330340	335060	Nigel Calder, one of the few bloggers who actually did read the paper, thinks the implication
335060	340720	of Heuer's words was that researchers should on no account endorse the Danish heresy, Henrik
340720	345620	Svensmark's hypothesis that most of the global warming of the 20th century can be explained
345620	350840	by the reduction in cosmic rays due to livelier solar activity, resulting in less low cloud
350840	353740	cover and warmer surface temperatures.
353740	359260	But if this is what he meant, there's a very good reason why his advice is spot on.
359260	363940	The CERN scientists didn't do any research into how clouds affect global temperature
363940	370140	or into any link between cosmic rays and climate during the 20th century, so how can they speculate
370140	375260	on what the results might have been for an experiment they didn't do?
375260	379820	And if they speculated that the global warming of the 20th century can be explained by the
379820	384520	reduction in cosmic rays due to livelier solar activity, their paper would have been
384520	388620	rejected by nature as undergraduate claptrap.
388620	392500	Because they have no evidence for this at all, since they didn't do any experiments
392500	397020	on this, they would have had to go to other papers that show that solar activity isn't
397020	402600	livelier, it's been very stable for half a century, and cosmic rays haven't been reduced
402600	407380	in activity, they follow the stable pattern of 11 year solar cycles.
407380	412400	If the researchers had to take anyone's advice, and I doubt they needed to anyway, it would
412400	418100	have been Hoyer's to stick with what the results show, rather than Calder's to go on a wild
418100	422980	speculative romp that flies in the face of observations.
422980	427060	Speculation without evidence wouldn't be published in one of the most prestigious journals in
427060	429340	science, it would end up on a blog.
