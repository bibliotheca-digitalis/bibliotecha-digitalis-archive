00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,280
Another mole has popped up, and after receiving several messages about a paper that finally

2
00:00:05,280 --> 00:00:10,100
settles the science of climate change, I thought it deserved to be whacked down and put in

3
00:00:10,100 --> 00:00:11,460
perspective.

4
00:00:11,460 --> 00:00:16,300
The latest urban myth to do the rounds of the internet is based on a paper by researchers

5
00:00:16,300 --> 00:00:20,380
from CERN, the European Particle Accelerator.

6
00:00:20,380 --> 00:00:25,220
Now I could read the paper, they wrote, but why bother going through all that sciencey

7
00:00:25,220 --> 00:00:30,300
stuff when a thousand internet bloggers don't need to read the paper in order to tell you

8
00:00:30,300 --> 00:00:32,580
everything it says?

9
00:00:32,580 --> 00:00:37,300
According to Newsroom America, researchers at CERN have concluded that global warming

10
00:00:37,300 --> 00:00:39,460
is caused by the sun.

11
00:00:39,460 --> 00:00:41,260
How do I know that's true?

12
00:00:41,260 --> 00:00:46,780
Because it's confirmed by NaturalNews.com and countless other blogs, and of course by

13
00:00:46,780 --> 00:00:49,920
James Delingpole at the Daily Telegraph.

14
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:55,180
As Delingpole himself admits, he doesn't read scientific papers, but if it's on the internet,

15
00:00:55,220 --> 00:01:01,420
and Delingpole believes it and repeats it, then that's confirmation that it must be true.

16
00:01:01,420 --> 00:01:05,260
The other conclusion that can be drawn from the paper, without actually having to read

17
00:01:05,260 --> 00:01:09,140
it, is that it now settles the science on climate change.

18
00:01:09,140 --> 00:01:14,520
The paper apparently has convincing new evidence that cosmic rays and the sun are the controllers

19
00:01:14,520 --> 00:01:18,340
of the Earth's climate, and that's settled.

20
00:01:18,340 --> 00:01:23,620
But before I go, look, I hate to do this to you, but I am going to have to show you the

21
00:01:23,620 --> 00:01:28,020
paper that all this hyperbole and hysteria is supposed to be based on.

22
00:01:28,020 --> 00:01:33,300
I know, it's tedious to actually check a source and read all that boring science, but let's

23
00:01:33,300 --> 00:01:38,000
see if the paper says what the bloggers think it ought to say.

24
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:40,580
Let's start with what it doesn't say.

25
00:01:40,580 --> 00:01:46,140
It doesn't say the sun is responsible for global warming, or anything like it.

26
00:01:46,140 --> 00:01:51,120
Maybe Newsroom America copied the quote from James Delingpole's column, but he didn't get

27
00:01:51,120 --> 00:01:56,640
it from the paper, he got it from another journalist and blogger, Lawrence Solomon.

28
00:01:56,640 --> 00:02:02,440
Solomon also seems to think the findings point to cosmic rays and the sun, not human activities,

29
00:02:02,440 --> 00:02:04,840
as the controller of climate on Earth.

30
00:02:04,840 --> 00:02:08,320
But the paper says nothing of the sort.

31
00:02:08,320 --> 00:02:10,520
So what does the paper say?

32
00:02:10,520 --> 00:02:15,600
Well, sorry bloggers, but to find out, you actually have to read it, instead of just

33
00:02:15,600 --> 00:02:18,680
copying and quoting off each other.

34
00:02:18,720 --> 00:02:23,560
The research is in response to a hypothesis by the Danish researcher Henrik Svensmark

35
00:02:23,560 --> 00:02:29,480
that cosmic rays could bring together, or nucleate, aerosol particles in the atmosphere,

36
00:02:29,480 --> 00:02:32,400
and that they could seed more clouds.

37
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:36,920
Svensmark postulates that more clouds might cause cooling, but let's not get ahead of

38
00:02:36,920 --> 00:02:37,920
ourselves.

39
00:02:37,920 --> 00:02:43,080
What the researchers at CERN confirmed was that cosmic rays can nucleate small particles

40
00:02:43,080 --> 00:02:45,060
in the atmosphere.

41
00:02:45,060 --> 00:02:49,080
This is a very interesting piece of research, but it's a long way from showing that cosmic

42
00:02:49,080 --> 00:02:51,900
rays drive the Earth's climate.

43
00:02:51,900 --> 00:02:56,460
If we believe Newsroom America, however, scientists were able to demonstrate that cosmic rays

44
00:02:56,460 --> 00:03:01,120
can form molecules that then grow seed clouds inside the atmosphere.

45
00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:05,400
In fact, the researchers specifically stated that they didn't demonstrate this.

46
00:03:05,400 --> 00:03:10,380
They wrote that because the nucleated particles produced in the experiment were quite small,

47
00:03:10,380 --> 00:03:14,900
it's not clear what fraction would grow large enough to seed cloud droplets.

48
00:03:14,900 --> 00:03:19,000
And if they could seed clouds, would this be significant compared to the amount of cloud

49
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:20,600
that's already up there?

50
00:03:20,600 --> 00:03:25,040
And if it is significant, what does that mean for atmospheric temperatures?

51
00:03:25,040 --> 00:03:27,020
Clouds have a dual role in climate.

52
00:03:27,020 --> 00:03:31,620
They reflect sunlight back into space and therefore have a negative cooling effect,

53
00:03:31,620 --> 00:03:36,540
but they also prevent heat from escaping and therefore have a positive warming effect.

54
00:03:36,540 --> 00:03:40,940
The cooling effect is greater in clouds near the ground, and at the equator, the warming

55
00:03:40,940 --> 00:03:45,220
effect is greater in clouds higher up and at greater latitudes.

56
00:03:45,220 --> 00:03:49,780
So even if it could be conclusively shown that there is a slight cooling, how much of

57
00:03:49,780 --> 00:03:55,940
a mitigating effect would that have on the warming caused by increased carbon dioxide?

58
00:03:55,940 --> 00:04:00,320
But these questions and uncertainties aren't the reason climatologists have rejected the

59
00:04:00,320 --> 00:04:02,620
cosmic ray hypothesis.

60
00:04:02,620 --> 00:04:07,620
They've rejected it for a much simpler reason, because if cosmic rays do have an effect on

61
00:04:07,620 --> 00:04:12,780
the temperature of the Earth, then we'd expect to see that in the climate record.

62
00:04:12,780 --> 00:04:17,380
Cosmic rays have been stable for the last 35 years, just as solar irradiance has been

63
00:04:17,380 --> 00:04:22,300
stable, so they can't account for the warming we've been seeing over that period.

64
00:04:22,300 --> 00:04:27,420
In short, cosmic rays and global temperatures can be measured over time, and they don't

65
00:04:27,420 --> 00:04:29,520
match up.

66
00:04:29,520 --> 00:04:33,580
So while the CERN researchers advance our knowledge of the way cosmic rays interact

67
00:04:33,580 --> 00:04:37,940
with the atmosphere, they didn't do any experiments to determine what effect this

68
00:04:37,940 --> 00:04:43,540
has on cloud cover, or what effect cloud cover has on global temperatures.

69
00:04:43,540 --> 00:04:48,020
Which brings us on to the next myth concerning this paper, that CERN Director-General Rolf

70
00:04:48,020 --> 00:04:53,700
Dieter Heuer said scientists should refrain from drawing conclusions from the experiment.

71
00:04:53,700 --> 00:04:58,460
This obviously makes no sense, as one discerning YouTuber surmised,

72
00:04:59,460 --> 00:05:16,660
The first thing that's obvious is that the paper did draw a conclusion that cosmic rays can nucleate aerosols.

73
00:05:16,660 --> 00:05:22,480
This is what the experiment was designed to find out, and what it demonstrated very clearly.

74
00:05:22,480 --> 00:05:27,460
What Heuer actually said, if we read the source of his comments in De Welt, is that the researchers

75
00:05:27,460 --> 00:05:30,340
shouldn't interpret the results.

76
00:05:30,340 --> 00:05:35,060
Nigel Calder, one of the few bloggers who actually did read the paper, thinks the implication

77
00:05:35,060 --> 00:05:40,720
of Heuer's words was that researchers should on no account endorse the Danish heresy, Henrik

78
00:05:40,720 --> 00:05:45,620
Svensmark's hypothesis that most of the global warming of the 20th century can be explained

79
00:05:45,620 --> 00:05:50,840
by the reduction in cosmic rays due to livelier solar activity, resulting in less low cloud

80
00:05:50,840 --> 00:05:53,740
cover and warmer surface temperatures.

81
00:05:53,740 --> 00:05:59,260
But if this is what he meant, there's a very good reason why his advice is spot on.

82
00:05:59,260 --> 00:06:03,940
The CERN scientists didn't do any research into how clouds affect global temperature

83
00:06:03,940 --> 00:06:10,140
or into any link between cosmic rays and climate during the 20th century, so how can they speculate

84
00:06:10,140 --> 00:06:15,260
on what the results might have been for an experiment they didn't do?

85
00:06:15,260 --> 00:06:19,820
And if they speculated that the global warming of the 20th century can be explained by the

86
00:06:19,820 --> 00:06:24,520
reduction in cosmic rays due to livelier solar activity, their paper would have been

87
00:06:24,520 --> 00:06:28,620
rejected by nature as undergraduate claptrap.

88
00:06:28,620 --> 00:06:32,500
Because they have no evidence for this at all, since they didn't do any experiments

89
00:06:32,500 --> 00:06:37,020
on this, they would have had to go to other papers that show that solar activity isn't

90
00:06:37,020 --> 00:06:42,600
livelier, it's been very stable for half a century, and cosmic rays haven't been reduced

91
00:06:42,600 --> 00:06:47,380
in activity, they follow the stable pattern of 11 year solar cycles.

92
00:06:47,380 --> 00:06:52,400
If the researchers had to take anyone's advice, and I doubt they needed to anyway, it would

93
00:06:52,400 --> 00:06:58,100
have been Hoyer's to stick with what the results show, rather than Calder's to go on a wild

94
00:06:58,100 --> 00:07:02,980
speculative romp that flies in the face of observations.

95
00:07:02,980 --> 00:07:07,060
Speculation without evidence wouldn't be published in one of the most prestigious journals in

96
00:07:07,060 --> 00:07:09,340
science, it would end up on a blog.
