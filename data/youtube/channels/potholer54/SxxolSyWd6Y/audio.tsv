0	2820	You've got a cow.
2820	8960	You want to teach it how to live all of its life in the open ocean, still retaining its
8960	11120	air-breathing characteristics.
11120	15960	What do you have to do from an engineering point of view to change the cow into a whale?
15960	17320	Good question.
17320	21960	David Bielinski was nominated for a Golden Crocoduck a few years ago, but I've resurrected
21960	26360	the nomination because we had a couple of other nominations this year on exactly the
26360	29400	same theme, improbability.
29400	35880	Bielinski is pondering evolution, which apparently requires turning cows into whales.
35880	41080	Virtually every feature of the cow has to be changed, it has to be adapted.
41080	47960	But since we know that life on Earth and life in the water are fundamentally different enterprises,
47960	50120	we have some sense of the number of changes.
50120	53840	We're not talking about genetics, we're talking about simple numbers.
53840	58440	The skin has to change completely, it has to become impermeable to water.
58440	59800	That's one change.
59800	64720	Breathing apparatus has to change, a diving apparatus has to be put in place, lactation
64720	69240	systems have to be designed, the eyes have to be protected, the hearing has to be altered,
69240	72760	salivary organs have to be changed, feeding mechanisms have to be changed.
72760	76120	After all, a cow eats grass, a whale doesn't.
76120	81360	As I say, I've tried to do some of these calculations, the calculations are certainly, certainly
81360	82840	not hard.
82840	86880	But they're interesting because I stopped at 50,000, that is morphological changes.
86880	87880	Okay, that's enough.
87880	88880	Let's go back a bit.
88880	93880	Dr Balinski, you're a mathematician and a philosopher, and I freely admit that you're
93880	95760	much, much smarter than me.
95760	99280	You've taught at university, and I came bottom of the class.
99280	102720	But even I know that cows did not turn into whales.
102720	106880	I think you've been watching too many creationist videos.
106880	116120	Yes, I understand you're talking philosophically, and the principle of one animal turning into
116120	117120	another.
117120	121860	But if you're going to count the number of changes from one particular species to another,
121860	124680	at least get your examples right.
124680	129640	Whales and cows both evolved from a common ancestor that lived about 50 million years
129640	133600	ago, partly in the water and partly on land.
133600	138520	By the way, I know Balinski claims not to be a creationist, but he's using a creationist
138520	143560	argument, he's a senior fellow of the Discovery Institute, and his breach of the ninth commandment
143560	150200	is promoting the creationist cause, so he does qualify for a coveted golden crocoduck.
150200	156160	Balinski counts at least 50,000 changes from a cow to a whale because, he explains, a cow
156160	160520	is a land animal completely unadapted to living in the water.
160520	166160	But the artiodactyl is already halfway there, so let's say it needs half as many changes,
166160	168060	about 25,000.
168060	172380	It needs to get bigger, have its nostrils moved higher, its hands would have to be used
172380	174380	as flippers, and so on.
174380	177820	And this has to be done over the course of about 50 million years.
177820	179360	Well, let's see.
179360	185140	If the animal takes seven years to reach breeding age, about halfway between a whale and a rodent,
185140	190740	then 25,000 changes would have to take place over 7 million generations.
190740	198420	That's about one change every 285 generations, hardly outside the bounds of possibility.
198420	202820	But what are the chances of these thousands of changes happening in exactly the right
202820	204980	way to make a whale?
204980	207140	Now there I would agree with Balinski.
207140	210320	The odds against it are staggeringly high.
210320	213500	So how did such impossible odds get beaten?
213500	219500	The answer lies in the story of Sandeep Singh, who won $30 million in the Mega Millions lottery.
219500	235180	And here's Jack Whittaker, who won $315 million in the Powerball lottery, Neil Wanlass
235180	240900	won $232 million, and Solomon Jackson Jr. won $260 million.
240900	242380	So what, you might think?
242380	249020	Well, the odds of Singh, or any of the others, winning is 1 in 175 million, which means that
249020	256660	the odds of Singh and Whittaker and Wanlass and Jackson winning are 875 million billion
256660	258880	billion to 1.
258880	263020	So how were such odds beaten without any of us thinking it extraordinary?
263020	266840	Well, the astute among you will already have figured out why.
266840	271300	The odds against anything happening are of course going to be astronomically high if
271300	274140	you try to achieve a known outcome.
274140	277460	In other words, if you name those people who are going to win the lotteries.
278180	281740	I don't play the lottery, but as far as I know, a jackpot just keeps getting bigger
281740	283420	until a winner is found.
283420	289020	So the odds of someone winning are in fact statistically 1 in 1, a certainty.
289020	294560	If Singh and Whittaker and Wanlass and Jackson hadn't won, 4 other people would have won.
294560	298740	We can lengthen the odds even more by looking at the chances of Singh or Whittaker or Wanlass
298740	300460	even being born.
300460	304680	They're about the same as the chances of me being born, which are astronomically high
304680	305940	against it.
306100	310300	Maybe I'm only here because a German pilot met a girl at a wedding, and the extra few
310300	315620	seconds he spent waving goodbye to her from the cockpit of his bomber delayed his take-off,
315620	320000	which meant that he dropped his bombs over Portsmouth a few seconds later than planned,
320000	323780	so that instead of killing my father, one of the bombs killed the man standing next
323780	325040	to him.
325040	329220	Going even further back, if my ancestor John Hadfield hadn't signed this contract to
329220	334980	buy a farm in 1605, he would have stayed at his old farm in Whitfold, and all of my subsequent
335020	337420	family history would have been different.
337420	341780	Even my great-great-great-great-great-great-great-grandparents wouldn't have been born.
341780	347660	The odds against me being born are astronomical, because every tiny event in history had to
347660	349860	happen exactly the way it happened.
349860	353820	No, it's not fate or divine will, it's simple.
353820	357220	If I hadn't been born, someone else would have been born.
357220	360820	If Sandeep Singh hadn't won the lottery, someone else would.
360820	365020	And if the artiodactyl hadn't evolved into a whale, it would have evolved into something
365020	366580	else.
366580	370780	And that's the problem with similar probability arguments, like the one that says the odds
370780	374780	are astronomically against the Earth to exist as we know it.
374780	379020	Again, if you start with the Earth as we know it and work backwards, then of course the
379020	384220	odds are astronomically against, but if you start with the universe as it is and calculate
384220	388580	the odds of an Earth-like planet, in other words a planet that's cool enough for water
388580	393300	not to boil and warm enough that it doesn't freeze, a planet with a magnetic field to
393300	397620	warn off solar wind, then the odds shorten to near certainty.
397620	402300	Out of the trillions upon trillions of star systems, there must be billions of planets
402300	404300	that fit the bill.
404300	407980	But that brings us to the next probability argument, the planet might have the right
407980	412320	environment and ingredients, but what are the chances chemicals will come together to
412320	413320	form life?
413320	417700	Abiogenesis is the idea that life can form from non-living material, which is also called
417820	421020	Spontaneous Generation, which was proven wrong over 200 years ago.
421020	422660	Woah, hey, what?
422660	424620	Oh, it's Cherry Boy.
424620	427180	He's back as a YouTuber called Horsewillbe.
427180	428180	As what?
428180	429180	I don't know.
429180	433940	Now what's this about Abiogenesis also being called Spontaneous Generation?
433940	437260	No prizes for guessing that Horsewillbe got this wrong.
437260	441220	Abiogenesis is called Abiogenesis.
441220	446980	Spontaneous Generation is a discredited Aristotelian idea that tried to explain the sudden overnight
447260	449860	appearance of things like maggots and mushrooms.
449860	453580	It didn't try to explain the formation of nucleic acids.
453580	455580	That's Abiogenesis.
455580	457620	See the difference?
457620	463100	Spontaneous Generation was disproved by Louis Pasteur and John Tyndall in this simple experiment.
463100	468540	They showed that apparently spontaneously generated organisms had their origins in spores
468540	469540	and eggs.
469540	473440	But we wouldn't expect Horsewillbe to know that because he's just reading some crap
473440	475180	he got off the internet.
475180	477260	But back to the question of probability.
477260	482740	The smallest living cell on Earth has a DNA string of some one million pairs of DNA, and
482740	484540	it has 600 genes.
484540	490620	If we cut this number and just took a quarter of that, we would have a string of some 250,000
490620	491620	base pairs of DNA.
491620	493540	That is still a hefty number.
493540	499100	The chances of such an arrangement of DNA arising by sheer chance are four to the 250,000th
499100	500700	power, and that's generous.
500700	504020	A video called Chatting with Charlie makes the same case.
504020	510000	Sir Frederick Hoyle said the chance of the chemicals of which DNA occur were to show
510000	514900	up in the same place at the same time is like 10 to the 40,000th.
514900	519980	Of course Hoyle wrote this long before new discoveries showed that DNA had evolved, probably
519980	521580	from RNA.
521580	524940	And sorry Horsewillbe, but the cell evolved too.
524940	530040	For these things to suddenly appear, fully formed, would be Spontaneous Generation, which
530040	533460	Horsewillbe has already told us doesn't happen.
533460	536140	Except in imaginary cases.
536140	541760	And as every creationist doesn't know, evolution is not driven by some random process, it's
541760	544540	driven by natural selection.
544540	549940	I addressed this in a much earlier video that was on my other channel, Potola 54 Debunks.
549940	555020	In trying to similarly explain the difficulty in getting all of the sequences of DNA together,
555020	559500	Hal Halbrook is explaining the impossibility of getting 20 numbers in sequence.
559500	565100	Now let's suppose that I could play at blinding speed and get all 20 blocks out in just one
565100	569540	second, then do it again the next second and every second thereafter.
569540	574420	The law of averages says that I can expect to get the 20 blocks out of the box in order
574420	580100	at the rate of once every 77 billion years.
580100	585900	Natural selection works by selecting those traits, in this case numbers, that are advantageous,
585900	589660	fit to survive, and rejecting those that aren't.
589660	592480	That's what survival of the fittest is all about.
592480	595040	So we pick the numbers at random, sure.
595040	600500	If the first one out of the box is a 6 or a 12, it gets rejected and goes back.
600500	604700	If it's a 1, then that's an advantageous trait that survives.
604700	607900	We then move on to the second number, and so on.
607900	612920	If we pick one number every second, as the video suggests, then it would only take 20
612920	616840	seconds at the most to get our first correct number, number 1.
616840	621480	It'll take 19 seconds at the most to get the next number in the sequence, number 2, and
621480	624820	18 seconds at the most to get number 3.
624820	630960	This means it'll take the mayor of Amity Island just 346 seconds, less than 6 minutes, to
630960	633180	get all the numbers in sequence.
633180	638200	That's very different to 77 million years, and that's the difference between natural
638200	658800	selection and natural chance.
658800	661460	If this was a random process, yes.
661460	666400	But now let's apply the rules of natural selection, which says that beneficial traits are kept
666400	669140	and non-beneficial ones are rejected.
669140	673520	Every time a slot machine comes up with a little bacterium, it stays there and the wheels
673520	676480	that didn't show a bacterium roll again.
676480	680800	If there are six symbols on the rollers, each of these wheels will come up with a bacterium
680800	682600	one time out of six.
682600	686640	If it takes 10 seconds for each pull on the slot machine, that means it'll take about
686640	690120	a minute for each wheel to register a bacterium.
690120	694360	And since each wheel is running at the same time, and all 250 machines are running at
694360	700360	the same time, it'll take just one minute for every single one to hit the jackpot.
700360	705280	This is why the casinos don't let you select which symbol to hold on every wheel.
705280	707880	Apparently they understand evolution.
707880	712240	And finally there's the probability pusher who has the occasional senior moment.
712240	723240	I'm assuming that one million beneficial mutations are needed to make a species evolve into another.
723240	727520	I'm assuming that 30 million species have existed throughout all time.
727520	735240	This is actually the estimate for species alive today.
735240	739760	I'm assuming that every single beneficial mutation is kept in the population once it
739760	744240	occurs, which means that natural selection is perfect.
744240	749840	Now the probability of evolution is one in ten to the power of...
749920	750920	Wait, wait, wait, wait.
750920	754840	I got all the assumptions, and I saw the final result.
754840	758080	What's missing is how you actually work this all out.
758080	760520	You know, the yada yada yada in the middle.
760520	762640	I guess we'll never know.
762640	767600	Creationists love to focus on the huge numbers, and show just how improbable improbable odds
767600	772280	are, while skipping over the detail of how these numbers are derived in the first place.
772280	778400	Like, for example, the calculation I've made that VenomFangX, now calling himself HorseWillBe,
778400	783360	will ever stop reading internet blogs and read just one page of a primary school science
783360	784360	book.
784360	788800	Computing the amount of homeschooling he must have received from creationist parents, coupled
788800	793800	with a high level of hormonal activity, the calculation is yada yada yada, and the answer
793800	798080	is one in ten to the power of ninety trillion.
798080	799720	Ten to the forty thousand.
799720	802520	Four to the two hundred and fifty thousandth power.
