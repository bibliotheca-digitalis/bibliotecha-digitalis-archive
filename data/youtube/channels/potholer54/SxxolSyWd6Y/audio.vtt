00:00.000 --> 00:02.820
You've got a cow.

00:02.820 --> 00:08.960
You want to teach it how to live all of its life in the open ocean, still retaining its

00:08.960 --> 00:11.120
air-breathing characteristics.

00:11.120 --> 00:15.960
What do you have to do from an engineering point of view to change the cow into a whale?

00:15.960 --> 00:17.320
Good question.

00:17.320 --> 00:21.960
David Bielinski was nominated for a Golden Crocoduck a few years ago, but I've resurrected

00:21.960 --> 00:26.360
the nomination because we had a couple of other nominations this year on exactly the

00:26.360 --> 00:29.400
same theme, improbability.

00:29.400 --> 00:35.880
Bielinski is pondering evolution, which apparently requires turning cows into whales.

00:35.880 --> 00:41.080
Virtually every feature of the cow has to be changed, it has to be adapted.

00:41.080 --> 00:47.960
But since we know that life on Earth and life in the water are fundamentally different enterprises,

00:47.960 --> 00:50.120
we have some sense of the number of changes.

00:50.120 --> 00:53.840
We're not talking about genetics, we're talking about simple numbers.

00:53.840 --> 00:58.440
The skin has to change completely, it has to become impermeable to water.

00:58.440 --> 00:59.800
That's one change.

00:59.800 --> 01:04.720
Breathing apparatus has to change, a diving apparatus has to be put in place, lactation

01:04.720 --> 01:09.240
systems have to be designed, the eyes have to be protected, the hearing has to be altered,

01:09.240 --> 01:12.760
salivary organs have to be changed, feeding mechanisms have to be changed.

01:12.760 --> 01:16.120
After all, a cow eats grass, a whale doesn't.

01:16.120 --> 01:21.360
As I say, I've tried to do some of these calculations, the calculations are certainly, certainly

01:21.360 --> 01:22.840
not hard.

01:22.840 --> 01:26.880
But they're interesting because I stopped at 50,000, that is morphological changes.

01:26.880 --> 01:27.880
Okay, that's enough.

01:27.880 --> 01:28.880
Let's go back a bit.

01:28.880 --> 01:33.880
Dr Balinski, you're a mathematician and a philosopher, and I freely admit that you're

01:33.880 --> 01:35.760
much, much smarter than me.

01:35.760 --> 01:39.280
You've taught at university, and I came bottom of the class.

01:39.280 --> 01:42.720
But even I know that cows did not turn into whales.

01:42.720 --> 01:46.880
I think you've been watching too many creationist videos.

01:46.880 --> 01:56.120
Yes, I understand you're talking philosophically, and the principle of one animal turning into

01:56.120 --> 01:57.120
another.

01:57.120 --> 02:01.860
But if you're going to count the number of changes from one particular species to another,

02:01.860 --> 02:04.680
at least get your examples right.

02:04.680 --> 02:09.640
Whales and cows both evolved from a common ancestor that lived about 50 million years

02:09.640 --> 02:13.600
ago, partly in the water and partly on land.

02:13.600 --> 02:18.520
By the way, I know Balinski claims not to be a creationist, but he's using a creationist

02:18.520 --> 02:23.560
argument, he's a senior fellow of the Discovery Institute, and his breach of the ninth commandment

02:23.560 --> 02:30.200
is promoting the creationist cause, so he does qualify for a coveted golden crocoduck.

02:30.200 --> 02:36.160
Balinski counts at least 50,000 changes from a cow to a whale because, he explains, a cow

02:36.160 --> 02:40.520
is a land animal completely unadapted to living in the water.

02:40.520 --> 02:46.160
But the artiodactyl is already halfway there, so let's say it needs half as many changes,

02:46.160 --> 02:48.060
about 25,000.

02:48.060 --> 02:52.380
It needs to get bigger, have its nostrils moved higher, its hands would have to be used

02:52.380 --> 02:54.380
as flippers, and so on.

02:54.380 --> 02:57.820
And this has to be done over the course of about 50 million years.

02:57.820 --> 02:59.360
Well, let's see.

02:59.360 --> 03:05.140
If the animal takes seven years to reach breeding age, about halfway between a whale and a rodent,

03:05.140 --> 03:10.740
then 25,000 changes would have to take place over 7 million generations.

03:10.740 --> 03:18.420
That's about one change every 285 generations, hardly outside the bounds of possibility.

03:18.420 --> 03:22.820
But what are the chances of these thousands of changes happening in exactly the right

03:22.820 --> 03:24.980
way to make a whale?

03:24.980 --> 03:27.140
Now there I would agree with Balinski.

03:27.140 --> 03:30.320
The odds against it are staggeringly high.

03:30.320 --> 03:33.500
So how did such impossible odds get beaten?

03:33.500 --> 03:39.500
The answer lies in the story of Sandeep Singh, who won $30 million in the Mega Millions lottery.

03:39.500 --> 03:55.180
And here's Jack Whittaker, who won $315 million in the Powerball lottery, Neil Wanlass

03:55.180 --> 04:00.900
won $232 million, and Solomon Jackson Jr. won $260 million.

04:00.900 --> 04:02.380
So what, you might think?

04:02.380 --> 04:09.020
Well, the odds of Singh, or any of the others, winning is 1 in 175 million, which means that

04:09.020 --> 04:16.660
the odds of Singh and Whittaker and Wanlass and Jackson winning are 875 million billion

04:16.660 --> 04:18.880
billion to 1.

04:18.880 --> 04:23.020
So how were such odds beaten without any of us thinking it extraordinary?

04:23.020 --> 04:26.840
Well, the astute among you will already have figured out why.

04:26.840 --> 04:31.300
The odds against anything happening are of course going to be astronomically high if

04:31.300 --> 04:34.140
you try to achieve a known outcome.

04:34.140 --> 04:37.460
In other words, if you name those people who are going to win the lotteries.

04:38.180 --> 04:41.740
I don't play the lottery, but as far as I know, a jackpot just keeps getting bigger

04:41.740 --> 04:43.420
until a winner is found.

04:43.420 --> 04:49.020
So the odds of someone winning are in fact statistically 1 in 1, a certainty.

04:49.020 --> 04:54.560
If Singh and Whittaker and Wanlass and Jackson hadn't won, 4 other people would have won.

04:54.560 --> 04:58.740
We can lengthen the odds even more by looking at the chances of Singh or Whittaker or Wanlass

04:58.740 --> 05:00.460
even being born.

05:00.460 --> 05:04.680
They're about the same as the chances of me being born, which are astronomically high

05:04.680 --> 05:05.940
against it.

05:06.100 --> 05:10.300
Maybe I'm only here because a German pilot met a girl at a wedding, and the extra few

05:10.300 --> 05:15.620
seconds he spent waving goodbye to her from the cockpit of his bomber delayed his take-off,

05:15.620 --> 05:20.000
which meant that he dropped his bombs over Portsmouth a few seconds later than planned,

05:20.000 --> 05:23.780
so that instead of killing my father, one of the bombs killed the man standing next

05:23.780 --> 05:25.040
to him.

05:25.040 --> 05:29.220
Going even further back, if my ancestor John Hadfield hadn't signed this contract to

05:29.220 --> 05:34.980
buy a farm in 1605, he would have stayed at his old farm in Whitfold, and all of my subsequent

05:35.020 --> 05:37.420
family history would have been different.

05:37.420 --> 05:41.780
Even my great-great-great-great-great-great-great-grandparents wouldn't have been born.

05:41.780 --> 05:47.660
The odds against me being born are astronomical, because every tiny event in history had to

05:47.660 --> 05:49.860
happen exactly the way it happened.

05:49.860 --> 05:53.820
No, it's not fate or divine will, it's simple.

05:53.820 --> 05:57.220
If I hadn't been born, someone else would have been born.

05:57.220 --> 06:00.820
If Sandeep Singh hadn't won the lottery, someone else would.

06:00.820 --> 06:05.020
And if the artiodactyl hadn't evolved into a whale, it would have evolved into something

06:05.020 --> 06:06.580
else.

06:06.580 --> 06:10.780
And that's the problem with similar probability arguments, like the one that says the odds

06:10.780 --> 06:14.780
are astronomically against the Earth to exist as we know it.

06:14.780 --> 06:19.020
Again, if you start with the Earth as we know it and work backwards, then of course the

06:19.020 --> 06:24.220
odds are astronomically against, but if you start with the universe as it is and calculate

06:24.220 --> 06:28.580
the odds of an Earth-like planet, in other words a planet that's cool enough for water

06:28.580 --> 06:33.300
not to boil and warm enough that it doesn't freeze, a planet with a magnetic field to

06:33.300 --> 06:37.620
warn off solar wind, then the odds shorten to near certainty.

06:37.620 --> 06:42.300
Out of the trillions upon trillions of star systems, there must be billions of planets

06:42.300 --> 06:44.300
that fit the bill.

06:44.300 --> 06:47.980
But that brings us to the next probability argument, the planet might have the right

06:47.980 --> 06:52.320
environment and ingredients, but what are the chances chemicals will come together to

06:52.320 --> 06:53.320
form life?

06:53.320 --> 06:57.700
Abiogenesis is the idea that life can form from non-living material, which is also called

06:57.820 --> 07:01.020
Spontaneous Generation, which was proven wrong over 200 years ago.

07:01.020 --> 07:02.660
Woah, hey, what?

07:02.660 --> 07:04.620
Oh, it's Cherry Boy.

07:04.620 --> 07:07.180
He's back as a YouTuber called Horsewillbe.

07:07.180 --> 07:08.180
As what?

07:08.180 --> 07:09.180
I don't know.

07:09.180 --> 07:13.940
Now what's this about Abiogenesis also being called Spontaneous Generation?

07:13.940 --> 07:17.260
No prizes for guessing that Horsewillbe got this wrong.

07:17.260 --> 07:21.220
Abiogenesis is called Abiogenesis.

07:21.220 --> 07:26.980
Spontaneous Generation is a discredited Aristotelian idea that tried to explain the sudden overnight

07:27.260 --> 07:29.860
appearance of things like maggots and mushrooms.

07:29.860 --> 07:33.580
It didn't try to explain the formation of nucleic acids.

07:33.580 --> 07:35.580
That's Abiogenesis.

07:35.580 --> 07:37.620
See the difference?

07:37.620 --> 07:43.100
Spontaneous Generation was disproved by Louis Pasteur and John Tyndall in this simple experiment.

07:43.100 --> 07:48.540
They showed that apparently spontaneously generated organisms had their origins in spores

07:48.540 --> 07:49.540
and eggs.

07:49.540 --> 07:53.440
But we wouldn't expect Horsewillbe to know that because he's just reading some crap

07:53.440 --> 07:55.180
he got off the internet.

07:55.180 --> 07:57.260
But back to the question of probability.

07:57.260 --> 08:02.740
The smallest living cell on Earth has a DNA string of some one million pairs of DNA, and

08:02.740 --> 08:04.540
it has 600 genes.

08:04.540 --> 08:10.620
If we cut this number and just took a quarter of that, we would have a string of some 250,000

08:10.620 --> 08:11.620
base pairs of DNA.

08:11.620 --> 08:13.540
That is still a hefty number.

08:13.540 --> 08:19.100
The chances of such an arrangement of DNA arising by sheer chance are four to the 250,000th

08:19.100 --> 08:20.700
power, and that's generous.

08:20.700 --> 08:24.020
A video called Chatting with Charlie makes the same case.

08:24.020 --> 08:30.000
Sir Frederick Hoyle said the chance of the chemicals of which DNA occur were to show

08:30.000 --> 08:34.900
up in the same place at the same time is like 10 to the 40,000th.

08:34.900 --> 08:39.980
Of course Hoyle wrote this long before new discoveries showed that DNA had evolved, probably

08:39.980 --> 08:41.580
from RNA.

08:41.580 --> 08:44.940
And sorry Horsewillbe, but the cell evolved too.

08:44.940 --> 08:50.040
For these things to suddenly appear, fully formed, would be Spontaneous Generation, which

08:50.040 --> 08:53.460
Horsewillbe has already told us doesn't happen.

08:53.460 --> 08:56.140
Except in imaginary cases.

08:56.140 --> 09:01.760
And as every creationist doesn't know, evolution is not driven by some random process, it's

09:01.760 --> 09:04.540
driven by natural selection.

09:04.540 --> 09:09.940
I addressed this in a much earlier video that was on my other channel, Potola 54 Debunks.

09:09.940 --> 09:15.020
In trying to similarly explain the difficulty in getting all of the sequences of DNA together,

09:15.020 --> 09:19.500
Hal Halbrook is explaining the impossibility of getting 20 numbers in sequence.

09:19.500 --> 09:25.100
Now let's suppose that I could play at blinding speed and get all 20 blocks out in just one

09:25.100 --> 09:29.540
second, then do it again the next second and every second thereafter.

09:29.540 --> 09:34.420
The law of averages says that I can expect to get the 20 blocks out of the box in order

09:34.420 --> 09:40.100
at the rate of once every 77 billion years.

09:40.100 --> 09:45.900
Natural selection works by selecting those traits, in this case numbers, that are advantageous,

09:45.900 --> 09:49.660
fit to survive, and rejecting those that aren't.

09:49.660 --> 09:52.480
That's what survival of the fittest is all about.

09:52.480 --> 09:55.040
So we pick the numbers at random, sure.

09:55.040 --> 10:00.500
If the first one out of the box is a 6 or a 12, it gets rejected and goes back.

10:00.500 --> 10:04.700
If it's a 1, then that's an advantageous trait that survives.

10:04.700 --> 10:07.900
We then move on to the second number, and so on.

10:07.900 --> 10:12.920
If we pick one number every second, as the video suggests, then it would only take 20

10:12.920 --> 10:16.840
seconds at the most to get our first correct number, number 1.

10:16.840 --> 10:21.480
It'll take 19 seconds at the most to get the next number in the sequence, number 2, and

10:21.480 --> 10:24.820
18 seconds at the most to get number 3.

10:24.820 --> 10:30.960
This means it'll take the mayor of Amity Island just 346 seconds, less than 6 minutes, to

10:30.960 --> 10:33.180
get all the numbers in sequence.

10:33.180 --> 10:38.200
That's very different to 77 million years, and that's the difference between natural

10:38.200 --> 10:58.800
selection and natural chance.

10:58.800 --> 11:01.460
If this was a random process, yes.

11:01.460 --> 11:06.400
But now let's apply the rules of natural selection, which says that beneficial traits are kept

11:06.400 --> 11:09.140
and non-beneficial ones are rejected.

11:09.140 --> 11:13.520
Every time a slot machine comes up with a little bacterium, it stays there and the wheels

11:13.520 --> 11:16.480
that didn't show a bacterium roll again.

11:16.480 --> 11:20.800
If there are six symbols on the rollers, each of these wheels will come up with a bacterium

11:20.800 --> 11:22.600
one time out of six.

11:22.600 --> 11:26.640
If it takes 10 seconds for each pull on the slot machine, that means it'll take about

11:26.640 --> 11:30.120
a minute for each wheel to register a bacterium.

11:30.120 --> 11:34.360
And since each wheel is running at the same time, and all 250 machines are running at

11:34.360 --> 11:40.360
the same time, it'll take just one minute for every single one to hit the jackpot.

11:40.360 --> 11:45.280
This is why the casinos don't let you select which symbol to hold on every wheel.

11:45.280 --> 11:47.880
Apparently they understand evolution.

11:47.880 --> 11:52.240
And finally there's the probability pusher who has the occasional senior moment.

11:52.240 --> 12:03.240
I'm assuming that one million beneficial mutations are needed to make a species evolve into another.

12:03.240 --> 12:07.520
I'm assuming that 30 million species have existed throughout all time.

12:07.520 --> 12:15.240
This is actually the estimate for species alive today.

12:15.240 --> 12:19.760
I'm assuming that every single beneficial mutation is kept in the population once it

12:19.760 --> 12:24.240
occurs, which means that natural selection is perfect.

12:24.240 --> 12:29.840
Now the probability of evolution is one in ten to the power of...

12:29.920 --> 12:30.920
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

12:30.920 --> 12:34.840
I got all the assumptions, and I saw the final result.

12:34.840 --> 12:38.080
What's missing is how you actually work this all out.

12:38.080 --> 12:40.520
You know, the yada yada yada in the middle.

12:40.520 --> 12:42.640
I guess we'll never know.

12:42.640 --> 12:47.600
Creationists love to focus on the huge numbers, and show just how improbable improbable odds

12:47.600 --> 12:52.280
are, while skipping over the detail of how these numbers are derived in the first place.

12:52.280 --> 12:58.400
Like, for example, the calculation I've made that VenomFangX, now calling himself HorseWillBe,

12:58.400 --> 13:03.360
will ever stop reading internet blogs and read just one page of a primary school science

13:03.360 --> 13:04.360
book.

13:04.360 --> 13:08.800
Computing the amount of homeschooling he must have received from creationist parents, coupled

13:08.800 --> 13:13.800
with a high level of hormonal activity, the calculation is yada yada yada, and the answer

13:13.800 --> 13:18.080
is one in ten to the power of ninety trillion.

13:18.080 --> 13:19.720
Ten to the forty thousand.

13:19.720 --> 13:22.520
Four to the two hundred and fifty thousandth power.
