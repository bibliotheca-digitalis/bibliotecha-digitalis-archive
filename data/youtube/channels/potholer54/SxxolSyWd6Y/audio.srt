1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,820
You've got a cow.

2
00:00:02,820 --> 00:00:08,960
You want to teach it how to live all of its life in the open ocean, still retaining its

3
00:00:08,960 --> 00:00:11,120
air-breathing characteristics.

4
00:00:11,120 --> 00:00:15,960
What do you have to do from an engineering point of view to change the cow into a whale?

5
00:00:15,960 --> 00:00:17,320
Good question.

6
00:00:17,320 --> 00:00:21,960
David Bielinski was nominated for a Golden Crocoduck a few years ago, but I've resurrected

7
00:00:21,960 --> 00:00:26,360
the nomination because we had a couple of other nominations this year on exactly the

8
00:00:26,360 --> 00:00:29,400
same theme, improbability.

9
00:00:29,400 --> 00:00:35,880
Bielinski is pondering evolution, which apparently requires turning cows into whales.

10
00:00:35,880 --> 00:00:41,080
Virtually every feature of the cow has to be changed, it has to be adapted.

11
00:00:41,080 --> 00:00:47,960
But since we know that life on Earth and life in the water are fundamentally different enterprises,

12
00:00:47,960 --> 00:00:50,120
we have some sense of the number of changes.

13
00:00:50,120 --> 00:00:53,840
We're not talking about genetics, we're talking about simple numbers.

14
00:00:53,840 --> 00:00:58,440
The skin has to change completely, it has to become impermeable to water.

15
00:00:58,440 --> 00:00:59,800
That's one change.

16
00:00:59,800 --> 00:01:04,720
Breathing apparatus has to change, a diving apparatus has to be put in place, lactation

17
00:01:04,720 --> 00:01:09,240
systems have to be designed, the eyes have to be protected, the hearing has to be altered,

18
00:01:09,240 --> 00:01:12,760
salivary organs have to be changed, feeding mechanisms have to be changed.

19
00:01:12,760 --> 00:01:16,120
After all, a cow eats grass, a whale doesn't.

20
00:01:16,120 --> 00:01:21,360
As I say, I've tried to do some of these calculations, the calculations are certainly, certainly

21
00:01:21,360 --> 00:01:22,840
not hard.

22
00:01:22,840 --> 00:01:26,880
But they're interesting because I stopped at 50,000, that is morphological changes.

23
00:01:26,880 --> 00:01:27,880
Okay, that's enough.

24
00:01:27,880 --> 00:01:28,880
Let's go back a bit.

25
00:01:28,880 --> 00:01:33,880
Dr Balinski, you're a mathematician and a philosopher, and I freely admit that you're

26
00:01:33,880 --> 00:01:35,760
much, much smarter than me.

27
00:01:35,760 --> 00:01:39,280
You've taught at university, and I came bottom of the class.

28
00:01:39,280 --> 00:01:42,720
But even I know that cows did not turn into whales.

29
00:01:42,720 --> 00:01:46,880
I think you've been watching too many creationist videos.

30
00:01:46,880 --> 00:01:56,120
Yes, I understand you're talking philosophically, and the principle of one animal turning into

31
00:01:56,120 --> 00:01:57,120
another.

32
00:01:57,120 --> 00:02:01,860
But if you're going to count the number of changes from one particular species to another,

33
00:02:01,860 --> 00:02:04,680
at least get your examples right.

34
00:02:04,680 --> 00:02:09,640
Whales and cows both evolved from a common ancestor that lived about 50 million years

35
00:02:09,640 --> 00:02:13,600
ago, partly in the water and partly on land.

36
00:02:13,600 --> 00:02:18,520
By the way, I know Balinski claims not to be a creationist, but he's using a creationist

37
00:02:18,520 --> 00:02:23,560
argument, he's a senior fellow of the Discovery Institute, and his breach of the ninth commandment

38
00:02:23,560 --> 00:02:30,200
is promoting the creationist cause, so he does qualify for a coveted golden crocoduck.

39
00:02:30,200 --> 00:02:36,160
Balinski counts at least 50,000 changes from a cow to a whale because, he explains, a cow

40
00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:40,520
is a land animal completely unadapted to living in the water.

41
00:02:40,520 --> 00:02:46,160
But the artiodactyl is already halfway there, so let's say it needs half as many changes,

42
00:02:46,160 --> 00:02:48,060
about 25,000.

43
00:02:48,060 --> 00:02:52,380
It needs to get bigger, have its nostrils moved higher, its hands would have to be used

44
00:02:52,380 --> 00:02:54,380
as flippers, and so on.

45
00:02:54,380 --> 00:02:57,820
And this has to be done over the course of about 50 million years.

46
00:02:57,820 --> 00:02:59,360
Well, let's see.

47
00:02:59,360 --> 00:03:05,140
If the animal takes seven years to reach breeding age, about halfway between a whale and a rodent,

48
00:03:05,140 --> 00:03:10,740
then 25,000 changes would have to take place over 7 million generations.

49
00:03:10,740 --> 00:03:18,420
That's about one change every 285 generations, hardly outside the bounds of possibility.

50
00:03:18,420 --> 00:03:22,820
But what are the chances of these thousands of changes happening in exactly the right

51
00:03:22,820 --> 00:03:24,980
way to make a whale?

52
00:03:24,980 --> 00:03:27,140
Now there I would agree with Balinski.

53
00:03:27,140 --> 00:03:30,320
The odds against it are staggeringly high.

54
00:03:30,320 --> 00:03:33,500
So how did such impossible odds get beaten?

55
00:03:33,500 --> 00:03:39,500
The answer lies in the story of Sandeep Singh, who won $30 million in the Mega Millions lottery.

56
00:03:39,500 --> 00:03:55,180
And here's Jack Whittaker, who won $315 million in the Powerball lottery, Neil Wanlass

57
00:03:55,180 --> 00:04:00,900
won $232 million, and Solomon Jackson Jr. won $260 million.

58
00:04:00,900 --> 00:04:02,380
So what, you might think?

59
00:04:02,380 --> 00:04:09,020
Well, the odds of Singh, or any of the others, winning is 1 in 175 million, which means that

60
00:04:09,020 --> 00:04:16,660
the odds of Singh and Whittaker and Wanlass and Jackson winning are 875 million billion

61
00:04:16,660 --> 00:04:18,880
billion to 1.

62
00:04:18,880 --> 00:04:23,020
So how were such odds beaten without any of us thinking it extraordinary?

63
00:04:23,020 --> 00:04:26,840
Well, the astute among you will already have figured out why.

64
00:04:26,840 --> 00:04:31,300
The odds against anything happening are of course going to be astronomically high if

65
00:04:31,300 --> 00:04:34,140
you try to achieve a known outcome.

66
00:04:34,140 --> 00:04:37,460
In other words, if you name those people who are going to win the lotteries.

67
00:04:38,180 --> 00:04:41,740
I don't play the lottery, but as far as I know, a jackpot just keeps getting bigger

68
00:04:41,740 --> 00:04:43,420
until a winner is found.

69
00:04:43,420 --> 00:04:49,020
So the odds of someone winning are in fact statistically 1 in 1, a certainty.

70
00:04:49,020 --> 00:04:54,560
If Singh and Whittaker and Wanlass and Jackson hadn't won, 4 other people would have won.

71
00:04:54,560 --> 00:04:58,740
We can lengthen the odds even more by looking at the chances of Singh or Whittaker or Wanlass

72
00:04:58,740 --> 00:05:00,460
even being born.

73
00:05:00,460 --> 00:05:04,680
They're about the same as the chances of me being born, which are astronomically high

74
00:05:04,680 --> 00:05:05,940
against it.

75
00:05:06,100 --> 00:05:10,300
Maybe I'm only here because a German pilot met a girl at a wedding, and the extra few

76
00:05:10,300 --> 00:05:15,620
seconds he spent waving goodbye to her from the cockpit of his bomber delayed his take-off,

77
00:05:15,620 --> 00:05:20,000
which meant that he dropped his bombs over Portsmouth a few seconds later than planned,

78
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:23,780
so that instead of killing my father, one of the bombs killed the man standing next

79
00:05:23,780 --> 00:05:25,040
to him.

80
00:05:25,040 --> 00:05:29,220
Going even further back, if my ancestor John Hadfield hadn't signed this contract to

81
00:05:29,220 --> 00:05:34,980
buy a farm in 1605, he would have stayed at his old farm in Whitfold, and all of my subsequent

82
00:05:35,020 --> 00:05:37,420
family history would have been different.

83
00:05:37,420 --> 00:05:41,780
Even my great-great-great-great-great-great-great-grandparents wouldn't have been born.

84
00:05:41,780 --> 00:05:47,660
The odds against me being born are astronomical, because every tiny event in history had to

85
00:05:47,660 --> 00:05:49,860
happen exactly the way it happened.

86
00:05:49,860 --> 00:05:53,820
No, it's not fate or divine will, it's simple.

87
00:05:53,820 --> 00:05:57,220
If I hadn't been born, someone else would have been born.

88
00:05:57,220 --> 00:06:00,820
If Sandeep Singh hadn't won the lottery, someone else would.

89
00:06:00,820 --> 00:06:05,020
And if the artiodactyl hadn't evolved into a whale, it would have evolved into something

90
00:06:05,020 --> 00:06:06,580
else.

91
00:06:06,580 --> 00:06:10,780
And that's the problem with similar probability arguments, like the one that says the odds

92
00:06:10,780 --> 00:06:14,780
are astronomically against the Earth to exist as we know it.

93
00:06:14,780 --> 00:06:19,020
Again, if you start with the Earth as we know it and work backwards, then of course the

94
00:06:19,020 --> 00:06:24,220
odds are astronomically against, but if you start with the universe as it is and calculate

95
00:06:24,220 --> 00:06:28,580
the odds of an Earth-like planet, in other words a planet that's cool enough for water

96
00:06:28,580 --> 00:06:33,300
not to boil and warm enough that it doesn't freeze, a planet with a magnetic field to

97
00:06:33,300 --> 00:06:37,620
warn off solar wind, then the odds shorten to near certainty.

98
00:06:37,620 --> 00:06:42,300
Out of the trillions upon trillions of star systems, there must be billions of planets

99
00:06:42,300 --> 00:06:44,300
that fit the bill.

100
00:06:44,300 --> 00:06:47,980
But that brings us to the next probability argument, the planet might have the right

101
00:06:47,980 --> 00:06:52,320
environment and ingredients, but what are the chances chemicals will come together to

102
00:06:52,320 --> 00:06:53,320
form life?

103
00:06:53,320 --> 00:06:57,700
Abiogenesis is the idea that life can form from non-living material, which is also called

104
00:06:57,820 --> 00:07:01,020
Spontaneous Generation, which was proven wrong over 200 years ago.

105
00:07:01,020 --> 00:07:02,660
Woah, hey, what?

106
00:07:02,660 --> 00:07:04,620
Oh, it's Cherry Boy.

107
00:07:04,620 --> 00:07:07,180
He's back as a YouTuber called Horsewillbe.

108
00:07:07,180 --> 00:07:08,180
As what?

109
00:07:08,180 --> 00:07:09,180
I don't know.

110
00:07:09,180 --> 00:07:13,940
Now what's this about Abiogenesis also being called Spontaneous Generation?

111
00:07:13,940 --> 00:07:17,260
No prizes for guessing that Horsewillbe got this wrong.

112
00:07:17,260 --> 00:07:21,220
Abiogenesis is called Abiogenesis.

113
00:07:21,220 --> 00:07:26,980
Spontaneous Generation is a discredited Aristotelian idea that tried to explain the sudden overnight

114
00:07:27,260 --> 00:07:29,860
appearance of things like maggots and mushrooms.

115
00:07:29,860 --> 00:07:33,580
It didn't try to explain the formation of nucleic acids.

116
00:07:33,580 --> 00:07:35,580
That's Abiogenesis.

117
00:07:35,580 --> 00:07:37,620
See the difference?

118
00:07:37,620 --> 00:07:43,100
Spontaneous Generation was disproved by Louis Pasteur and John Tyndall in this simple experiment.

119
00:07:43,100 --> 00:07:48,540
They showed that apparently spontaneously generated organisms had their origins in spores

120
00:07:48,540 --> 00:07:49,540
and eggs.

121
00:07:49,540 --> 00:07:53,440
But we wouldn't expect Horsewillbe to know that because he's just reading some crap

122
00:07:53,440 --> 00:07:55,180
he got off the internet.

123
00:07:55,180 --> 00:07:57,260
But back to the question of probability.

124
00:07:57,260 --> 00:08:02,740
The smallest living cell on Earth has a DNA string of some one million pairs of DNA, and

125
00:08:02,740 --> 00:08:04,540
it has 600 genes.

126
00:08:04,540 --> 00:08:10,620
If we cut this number and just took a quarter of that, we would have a string of some 250,000

127
00:08:10,620 --> 00:08:11,620
base pairs of DNA.

128
00:08:11,620 --> 00:08:13,540
That is still a hefty number.

129
00:08:13,540 --> 00:08:19,100
The chances of such an arrangement of DNA arising by sheer chance are four to the 250,000th

130
00:08:19,100 --> 00:08:20,700
power, and that's generous.

131
00:08:20,700 --> 00:08:24,020
A video called Chatting with Charlie makes the same case.

132
00:08:24,020 --> 00:08:30,000
Sir Frederick Hoyle said the chance of the chemicals of which DNA occur were to show

133
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:34,900
up in the same place at the same time is like 10 to the 40,000th.

134
00:08:34,900 --> 00:08:39,980
Of course Hoyle wrote this long before new discoveries showed that DNA had evolved, probably

135
00:08:39,980 --> 00:08:41,580
from RNA.

136
00:08:41,580 --> 00:08:44,940
And sorry Horsewillbe, but the cell evolved too.

137
00:08:44,940 --> 00:08:50,040
For these things to suddenly appear, fully formed, would be Spontaneous Generation, which

138
00:08:50,040 --> 00:08:53,460
Horsewillbe has already told us doesn't happen.

139
00:08:53,460 --> 00:08:56,140
Except in imaginary cases.

140
00:08:56,140 --> 00:09:01,760
And as every creationist doesn't know, evolution is not driven by some random process, it's

141
00:09:01,760 --> 00:09:04,540
driven by natural selection.

142
00:09:04,540 --> 00:09:09,940
I addressed this in a much earlier video that was on my other channel, Potola 54 Debunks.

143
00:09:09,940 --> 00:09:15,020
In trying to similarly explain the difficulty in getting all of the sequences of DNA together,

144
00:09:15,020 --> 00:09:19,500
Hal Halbrook is explaining the impossibility of getting 20 numbers in sequence.

145
00:09:19,500 --> 00:09:25,100
Now let's suppose that I could play at blinding speed and get all 20 blocks out in just one

146
00:09:25,100 --> 00:09:29,540
second, then do it again the next second and every second thereafter.

147
00:09:29,540 --> 00:09:34,420
The law of averages says that I can expect to get the 20 blocks out of the box in order

148
00:09:34,420 --> 00:09:40,100
at the rate of once every 77 billion years.

149
00:09:40,100 --> 00:09:45,900
Natural selection works by selecting those traits, in this case numbers, that are advantageous,

150
00:09:45,900 --> 00:09:49,660
fit to survive, and rejecting those that aren't.

151
00:09:49,660 --> 00:09:52,480
That's what survival of the fittest is all about.

152
00:09:52,480 --> 00:09:55,040
So we pick the numbers at random, sure.

153
00:09:55,040 --> 00:10:00,500
If the first one out of the box is a 6 or a 12, it gets rejected and goes back.

154
00:10:00,500 --> 00:10:04,700
If it's a 1, then that's an advantageous trait that survives.

155
00:10:04,700 --> 00:10:07,900
We then move on to the second number, and so on.

156
00:10:07,900 --> 00:10:12,920
If we pick one number every second, as the video suggests, then it would only take 20

157
00:10:12,920 --> 00:10:16,840
seconds at the most to get our first correct number, number 1.

158
00:10:16,840 --> 00:10:21,480
It'll take 19 seconds at the most to get the next number in the sequence, number 2, and

159
00:10:21,480 --> 00:10:24,820
18 seconds at the most to get number 3.

160
00:10:24,820 --> 00:10:30,960
This means it'll take the mayor of Amity Island just 346 seconds, less than 6 minutes, to

161
00:10:30,960 --> 00:10:33,180
get all the numbers in sequence.

162
00:10:33,180 --> 00:10:38,200
That's very different to 77 million years, and that's the difference between natural

163
00:10:38,200 --> 00:10:58,800
selection and natural chance.

164
00:10:58,800 --> 00:11:01,460
If this was a random process, yes.

165
00:11:01,460 --> 00:11:06,400
But now let's apply the rules of natural selection, which says that beneficial traits are kept

166
00:11:06,400 --> 00:11:09,140
and non-beneficial ones are rejected.

167
00:11:09,140 --> 00:11:13,520
Every time a slot machine comes up with a little bacterium, it stays there and the wheels

168
00:11:13,520 --> 00:11:16,480
that didn't show a bacterium roll again.

169
00:11:16,480 --> 00:11:20,800
If there are six symbols on the rollers, each of these wheels will come up with a bacterium

170
00:11:20,800 --> 00:11:22,600
one time out of six.

171
00:11:22,600 --> 00:11:26,640
If it takes 10 seconds for each pull on the slot machine, that means it'll take about

172
00:11:26,640 --> 00:11:30,120
a minute for each wheel to register a bacterium.

173
00:11:30,120 --> 00:11:34,360
And since each wheel is running at the same time, and all 250 machines are running at

174
00:11:34,360 --> 00:11:40,360
the same time, it'll take just one minute for every single one to hit the jackpot.

175
00:11:40,360 --> 00:11:45,280
This is why the casinos don't let you select which symbol to hold on every wheel.

176
00:11:45,280 --> 00:11:47,880
Apparently they understand evolution.

177
00:11:47,880 --> 00:11:52,240
And finally there's the probability pusher who has the occasional senior moment.

178
00:11:52,240 --> 00:12:03,240
I'm assuming that one million beneficial mutations are needed to make a species evolve into another.

179
00:12:03,240 --> 00:12:07,520
I'm assuming that 30 million species have existed throughout all time.

180
00:12:07,520 --> 00:12:15,240
This is actually the estimate for species alive today.

181
00:12:15,240 --> 00:12:19,760
I'm assuming that every single beneficial mutation is kept in the population once it

182
00:12:19,760 --> 00:12:24,240
occurs, which means that natural selection is perfect.

183
00:12:24,240 --> 00:12:29,840
Now the probability of evolution is one in ten to the power of...

184
00:12:29,920 --> 00:12:30,920
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

185
00:12:30,920 --> 00:12:34,840
I got all the assumptions, and I saw the final result.

186
00:12:34,840 --> 00:12:38,080
What's missing is how you actually work this all out.

187
00:12:38,080 --> 00:12:40,520
You know, the yada yada yada in the middle.

188
00:12:40,520 --> 00:12:42,640
I guess we'll never know.

189
00:12:42,640 --> 00:12:47,600
Creationists love to focus on the huge numbers, and show just how improbable improbable odds

190
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:52,280
are, while skipping over the detail of how these numbers are derived in the first place.

191
00:12:52,280 --> 00:12:58,400
Like, for example, the calculation I've made that VenomFangX, now calling himself HorseWillBe,

192
00:12:58,400 --> 00:13:03,360
will ever stop reading internet blogs and read just one page of a primary school science

193
00:13:03,360 --> 00:13:04,360
book.

194
00:13:04,360 --> 00:13:08,800
Computing the amount of homeschooling he must have received from creationist parents, coupled

195
00:13:08,800 --> 00:13:13,800
with a high level of hormonal activity, the calculation is yada yada yada, and the answer

196
00:13:13,800 --> 00:13:18,080
is one in ten to the power of ninety trillion.

197
00:13:18,080 --> 00:13:19,720
Ten to the forty thousand.

198
00:13:19,720 --> 00:13:22,520
Four to the two hundred and fifty thousandth power.
