Hi, Peter and YouTube viewers. I'm Jonathan Jennings, Executive Director of Health and

00:03.680 --> 00:08.400
Harmony, and today I'm in Indonesian Borneo with our partner, Asri, inside their incredible

00:08.400 --> 00:13.280
hospital here in the rainforest. More on that video in a minute, so if you're a fan of this

00:13.280 --> 00:19.120
channel, please stay tuned. First, to let you know that I've got a few videos in the pipeline,

00:19.120 --> 00:23.680
part two of my look at free market solutions to climate change, of course, and a video looking

00:23.680 --> 00:29.760
at this scientific explanation for what are too often called miracles. As part of my Science and

00:29.760 --> 00:34.960
the Media series, I'll have a video showing how the line between fact and opinion is being blurred

00:34.960 --> 00:41.680
in the media, especially when it comes to science, and a video on basic geology for those creationists

00:41.680 --> 00:48.000
who thought my video, The Age of Our World Made Easy, was way too difficult. I don't get paid to

00:48.000 --> 00:53.280
make these videos, and a lot of the meticulous fact-checking, citing of sources, and correcting

00:53.280 --> 00:59.600
of errors takes time. The ads you see at the start of some of my videos have been forced on me by

01:00.480 --> 01:05.440
YouTube, because it seems it's no longer possible to contest copyright claims in cases where I

01:05.440 --> 01:12.240
legitimately use video clips for the purpose of rebuttal. YouTube has decided instead to simply

01:12.240 --> 01:18.640
stick ads onto my videos and give the revenue to the copyright holder. I'm trying to fix that, but

01:18.640 --> 01:25.680
my channel remains unmonetized. In lieu of payment and responding to the many offers of financial

01:25.680 --> 01:32.400
support, I asked people to support a charity I came across in 2016 when I went on assignment

01:32.400 --> 01:38.720
to Borneo. One of the stories I covered was here in the remote southwest corner of the island,

01:38.720 --> 01:44.640
where a group of doctors and dentists had started a remarkable project that trades affordable medical

01:44.640 --> 01:50.960
care for rainforest protection. Before these medical practitioners came along, local villagers

01:50.960 --> 01:56.240
around this national park were entering the forest and cutting down trees to get money.

01:56.240 --> 02:01.280
They didn't need the money for food. They didn't need it for shelter. The villagers even knew it

02:01.280 --> 02:06.720
was doing harm to their community's environment and water supplies. They didn't want to do it.

02:06.720 --> 02:11.920
What they needed the money for were medical emergencies. When your kids are sick, you'll

02:11.920 --> 02:17.520
pretty much do anything to get them treated. So an American doctor and an Indonesian dentist listened

02:17.520 --> 02:22.800
to their concerns and made an offer to each village. If your village pledges not to cut

02:22.800 --> 02:30.000
down any trees, we'll slash our medical fees by 70%. The remaining 30%, you can pay in the form

02:30.000 --> 02:35.920
of seedlings. A clinic was set up, villagers pledged their support and patients flooded in.

02:36.560 --> 02:41.280
The seedlings they use as payment are then taken to the areas of the national park that have been

02:41.280 --> 02:47.040
logged and replanted. The project receives carbon credits for this and the money they get from

02:47.120 --> 02:51.760
carbon credits helps pay the salary of young doctors and dentists who come to work at the

02:51.760 --> 02:57.280
clinic. But they also depend on charitable donations and they don't have any expensive

02:57.280 --> 03:03.120
high-profile funding campaigns. So I was delighted that within days of me endorsing them,

03:03.120 --> 03:08.000
thousands of dollars poured in from my subscribers. So adding to my thanks,

03:08.000 --> 03:12.640
this is the charity's way of saying thank you to everyone and give you all a progress report.

03:17.680 --> 03:23.200
Since pot holder 54 started featuring Health and Harmony's work about a year ago,

03:23.200 --> 03:30.080
175 of you have donated about 20,000 US dollars to Health and Harmony. So today we want to give

03:30.080 --> 03:35.280
you special insight into how we're using those donations here in Borneo to improve the lives of

03:35.280 --> 03:40.800
people, the ecosystem, this incredible rain forest and the planet. Thank you very much.

03:40.800 --> 03:47.120
One of the ways your donations is making a difference here in Borneo is through our

03:47.120 --> 03:52.960
chainsaw buyback program. August, how many chainsaws have you bought so far in the one

03:52.960 --> 04:03.920
year old program? And why are you buying these chainsaws? What is the purpose of your program?

04:11.440 --> 04:16.080
Fantastic. And you have, you have managed to buy back 65 chainsaws.

04:16.080 --> 04:23.040
How many chainsaws do you want to buy? 150 units.

04:24.480 --> 04:32.080
So 150 chainsaws is the target. And the reason is there are about 150 loggers left inside of

04:32.080 --> 04:38.160
Borneo Island National Park. So it's not enough, August knows, just to buy the chainsaw. August

04:38.160 --> 04:45.040
and his team are then training, mentoring, accompanying the logger and the logger's wife

04:45.040 --> 04:46.960
in the development of a small business.

05:09.040 --> 05:15.920
So we're not only just buying the chainsaw from the loggers, but we also start an alternative

05:15.920 --> 05:24.960
livelihood for them so that they do not go back to logging. And you said that there's a decrease

05:25.920 --> 05:33.760
with 89% decrease in illegal logging households in Gunung Palung. Actually the 11% remaining,

05:34.400 --> 05:41.280
every one of them actually wants to stop logging. So by doing this chainsaw buyback program,

05:41.280 --> 05:46.480
we're actually helping them to actually do what they want to do for the forest.

05:47.120 --> 05:54.400
And, you know, Peter and Peter, your followers, Auto54 viewers, thank you so much. We can't do

05:54.400 --> 05:59.920
this without you. We, Peter, we respect your work so much. We're climate change is concerned. We're

05:59.920 --> 06:06.240
all big fans of yours and we're thrilled that some of your followers are now supporting our work

06:06.240 --> 06:11.360
and we look forward to staying in touch. Thank you so much. Thank you. What I love about this

06:11.360 --> 06:16.960
project is that it ticks two boxes for me. Most charities that deal with people's urgent medical

06:16.960 --> 06:22.320
needs do little for the environment. Most environmental charities do little for people's

06:22.320 --> 06:29.360
urgent medical needs. This project does both. The other reason I love it is that it works.

06:29.360 --> 06:34.160
As you've seen, the rate of deforestation has plunged and the health of the population is much

06:34.160 --> 06:39.440
better. I was with a group of doctors when they responded to one call where they managed to save

06:39.440 --> 06:45.760
the life of a young girl. Areas that were once cleared of trees are now reforested and camera

06:45.760 --> 06:51.920
traps show that animals and birds are back. Thanks in part to your donations, they've gone from being

06:51.920 --> 06:57.840
a small clinic to a small hospital and hope to introduce this model in other countries.

06:57.840 --> 07:02.480
But right now, they need money for a new truck and have put out an urgent appeal.

07:02.480 --> 07:06.800
It's costing them time and money to keep fixing the old one, so if you can help,

07:06.800 --> 07:12.560
please click on the links in the video description and donate. There are also links to my BBC report

07:12.560 --> 07:17.760
on the project. On days when I don't feel up to working on videos for my channel, it really is

07:17.760 --> 07:24.080
an incentive to know that every video I produce helps this important work and your donations force

07:24.080 --> 07:30.320
me to get on with it. So come on, give me a boot up the backside. Even people who hate this channel

07:30.320 --> 07:31.680
will want to do that.
