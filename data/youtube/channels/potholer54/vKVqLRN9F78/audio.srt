Hi, Peter and YouTube viewers. I'm Jonathan Jennings, Executive Director of Health and

2
00:00:03,680 --> 00:00:08,400
Harmony, and today I'm in Indonesian Borneo with our partner, Asri, inside their incredible

3
00:00:08,400 --> 00:00:13,280
hospital here in the rainforest. More on that video in a minute, so if you're a fan of this

4
00:00:13,280 --> 00:00:19,120
channel, please stay tuned. First, to let you know that I've got a few videos in the pipeline,

5
00:00:19,120 --> 00:00:23,680
part two of my look at free market solutions to climate change, of course, and a video looking

6
00:00:23,680 --> 00:00:29,760
at this scientific explanation for what are too often called miracles. As part of my Science and

7
00:00:29,760 --> 00:00:34,960
the Media series, I'll have a video showing how the line between fact and opinion is being blurred

8
00:00:34,960 --> 00:00:41,680
in the media, especially when it comes to science, and a video on basic geology for those creationists

9
00:00:41,680 --> 00:00:48,000
who thought my video, The Age of Our World Made Easy, was way too difficult. I don't get paid to

10
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:53,280
make these videos, and a lot of the meticulous fact-checking, citing of sources, and correcting

11
00:00:53,280 --> 00:00:59,600
of errors takes time. The ads you see at the start of some of my videos have been forced on me by

12
00:01:00,480 --> 00:01:05,440
YouTube, because it seems it's no longer possible to contest copyright claims in cases where I

13
00:01:05,440 --> 00:01:12,240
legitimately use video clips for the purpose of rebuttal. YouTube has decided instead to simply

14
00:01:12,240 --> 00:01:18,640
stick ads onto my videos and give the revenue to the copyright holder. I'm trying to fix that, but

15
00:01:18,640 --> 00:01:25,680
my channel remains unmonetized. In lieu of payment and responding to the many offers of financial

16
00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:32,400
support, I asked people to support a charity I came across in 2016 when I went on assignment

17
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:38,720
to Borneo. One of the stories I covered was here in the remote southwest corner of the island,

18
00:01:38,720 --> 00:01:44,640
where a group of doctors and dentists had started a remarkable project that trades affordable medical

19
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:50,960
care for rainforest protection. Before these medical practitioners came along, local villagers

20
00:01:50,960 --> 00:01:56,240
around this national park were entering the forest and cutting down trees to get money.

21
00:01:56,240 --> 00:02:01,280
They didn't need the money for food. They didn't need it for shelter. The villagers even knew it

22
00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:06,720
was doing harm to their community's environment and water supplies. They didn't want to do it.

23
00:02:06,720 --> 00:02:11,920
What they needed the money for were medical emergencies. When your kids are sick, you'll

24
00:02:11,920 --> 00:02:17,520
pretty much do anything to get them treated. So an American doctor and an Indonesian dentist listened

25
00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:22,800
to their concerns and made an offer to each village. If your village pledges not to cut

26
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:30,000
down any trees, we'll slash our medical fees by 70%. The remaining 30%, you can pay in the form

27
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:35,920
of seedlings. A clinic was set up, villagers pledged their support and patients flooded in.

28
00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:41,280
The seedlings they use as payment are then taken to the areas of the national park that have been

29
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:47,040
logged and replanted. The project receives carbon credits for this and the money they get from

30
00:02:47,120 --> 00:02:51,760
carbon credits helps pay the salary of young doctors and dentists who come to work at the

31
00:02:51,760 --> 00:02:57,280
clinic. But they also depend on charitable donations and they don't have any expensive

32
00:02:57,280 --> 00:03:03,120
high-profile funding campaigns. So I was delighted that within days of me endorsing them,

33
00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:08,000
thousands of dollars poured in from my subscribers. So adding to my thanks,

34
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:12,640
this is the charity's way of saying thank you to everyone and give you all a progress report.

35
00:03:17,680 --> 00:03:23,200
Since pot holder 54 started featuring Health and Harmony's work about a year ago,

36
00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:30,080
175 of you have donated about 20,000 US dollars to Health and Harmony. So today we want to give

37
00:03:30,080 --> 00:03:35,280
you special insight into how we're using those donations here in Borneo to improve the lives of

38
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:40,800
people, the ecosystem, this incredible rain forest and the planet. Thank you very much.

39
00:03:40,800 --> 00:03:47,120
One of the ways your donations is making a difference here in Borneo is through our

40
00:03:47,120 --> 00:03:52,960
chainsaw buyback program. August, how many chainsaws have you bought so far in the one

41
00:03:52,960 --> 00:04:03,920
year old program? And why are you buying these chainsaws? What is the purpose of your program?

42
00:04:11,440 --> 00:04:16,080
Fantastic. And you have, you have managed to buy back 65 chainsaws.

43
00:04:16,080 --> 00:04:23,040
How many chainsaws do you want to buy? 150 units.

44
00:04:24,480 --> 00:04:32,080
So 150 chainsaws is the target. And the reason is there are about 150 loggers left inside of

45
00:04:32,080 --> 00:04:38,160
Borneo Island National Park. So it's not enough, August knows, just to buy the chainsaw. August

46
00:04:38,160 --> 00:04:45,040
and his team are then training, mentoring, accompanying the logger and the logger's wife

47
00:04:45,040 --> 00:04:46,960
in the development of a small business.

48
00:05:09,040 --> 00:05:15,920
So we're not only just buying the chainsaw from the loggers, but we also start an alternative

49
00:05:15,920 --> 00:05:24,960
livelihood for them so that they do not go back to logging. And you said that there's a decrease

50
00:05:25,920 --> 00:05:33,760
with 89% decrease in illegal logging households in Gunung Palung. Actually the 11% remaining,

51
00:05:34,400 --> 00:05:41,280
every one of them actually wants to stop logging. So by doing this chainsaw buyback program,

52
00:05:41,280 --> 00:05:46,480
we're actually helping them to actually do what they want to do for the forest.

53
00:05:47,120 --> 00:05:54,400
And, you know, Peter and Peter, your followers, Auto54 viewers, thank you so much. We can't do

54
00:05:54,400 --> 00:05:59,920
this without you. We, Peter, we respect your work so much. We're climate change is concerned. We're

55
00:05:59,920 --> 00:06:06,240
all big fans of yours and we're thrilled that some of your followers are now supporting our work

56
00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:11,360
and we look forward to staying in touch. Thank you so much. Thank you. What I love about this

57
00:06:11,360 --> 00:06:16,960
project is that it ticks two boxes for me. Most charities that deal with people's urgent medical

58
00:06:16,960 --> 00:06:22,320
needs do little for the environment. Most environmental charities do little for people's

59
00:06:22,320 --> 00:06:29,360
urgent medical needs. This project does both. The other reason I love it is that it works.

60
00:06:29,360 --> 00:06:34,160
As you've seen, the rate of deforestation has plunged and the health of the population is much

61
00:06:34,160 --> 00:06:39,440
better. I was with a group of doctors when they responded to one call where they managed to save

62
00:06:39,440 --> 00:06:45,760
the life of a young girl. Areas that were once cleared of trees are now reforested and camera

63
00:06:45,760 --> 00:06:51,920
traps show that animals and birds are back. Thanks in part to your donations, they've gone from being

64
00:06:51,920 --> 00:06:57,840
a small clinic to a small hospital and hope to introduce this model in other countries.

65
00:06:57,840 --> 00:07:02,480
But right now, they need money for a new truck and have put out an urgent appeal.

66
00:07:02,480 --> 00:07:06,800
It's costing them time and money to keep fixing the old one, so if you can help,

67
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:12,560
please click on the links in the video description and donate. There are also links to my BBC report

68
00:07:12,560 --> 00:07:17,760
on the project. On days when I don't feel up to working on videos for my channel, it really is

69
00:07:17,760 --> 00:07:24,080
an incentive to know that every video I produce helps this important work and your donations force

70
00:07:24,080 --> 00:07:30,320
me to get on with it. So come on, give me a boot up the backside. Even people who hate this channel

71
00:07:30,320 --> 00:07:31,680
will want to do that.
