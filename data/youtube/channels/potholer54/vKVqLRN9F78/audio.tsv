0	3680	Hi, Peter and YouTube viewers. I'm Jonathan Jennings, Executive Director of Health and
3680	8400	Harmony, and today I'm in Indonesian Borneo with our partner, Asri, inside their incredible
8400	13280	hospital here in the rainforest. More on that video in a minute, so if you're a fan of this
13280	19120	channel, please stay tuned. First, to let you know that I've got a few videos in the pipeline,
19120	23680	part two of my look at free market solutions to climate change, of course, and a video looking
23680	29760	at this scientific explanation for what are too often called miracles. As part of my Science and
29760	34960	the Media series, I'll have a video showing how the line between fact and opinion is being blurred
34960	41680	in the media, especially when it comes to science, and a video on basic geology for those creationists
41680	48000	who thought my video, The Age of Our World Made Easy, was way too difficult. I don't get paid to
48000	53280	make these videos, and a lot of the meticulous fact-checking, citing of sources, and correcting
53280	59600	of errors takes time. The ads you see at the start of some of my videos have been forced on me by
60480	65440	YouTube, because it seems it's no longer possible to contest copyright claims in cases where I
65440	72240	legitimately use video clips for the purpose of rebuttal. YouTube has decided instead to simply
72240	78640	stick ads onto my videos and give the revenue to the copyright holder. I'm trying to fix that, but
78640	85680	my channel remains unmonetized. In lieu of payment and responding to the many offers of financial
85680	92400	support, I asked people to support a charity I came across in 2016 when I went on assignment
92400	98720	to Borneo. One of the stories I covered was here in the remote southwest corner of the island,
98720	104640	where a group of doctors and dentists had started a remarkable project that trades affordable medical
104640	110960	care for rainforest protection. Before these medical practitioners came along, local villagers
110960	116240	around this national park were entering the forest and cutting down trees to get money.
116240	121280	They didn't need the money for food. They didn't need it for shelter. The villagers even knew it
121280	126720	was doing harm to their community's environment and water supplies. They didn't want to do it.
126720	131920	What they needed the money for were medical emergencies. When your kids are sick, you'll
131920	137520	pretty much do anything to get them treated. So an American doctor and an Indonesian dentist listened
137520	142800	to their concerns and made an offer to each village. If your village pledges not to cut
142800	150000	down any trees, we'll slash our medical fees by 70%. The remaining 30%, you can pay in the form
150000	155920	of seedlings. A clinic was set up, villagers pledged their support and patients flooded in.
156560	161280	The seedlings they use as payment are then taken to the areas of the national park that have been
161280	167040	logged and replanted. The project receives carbon credits for this and the money they get from
167120	171760	carbon credits helps pay the salary of young doctors and dentists who come to work at the
171760	177280	clinic. But they also depend on charitable donations and they don't have any expensive
177280	183120	high-profile funding campaigns. So I was delighted that within days of me endorsing them,
183120	188000	thousands of dollars poured in from my subscribers. So adding to my thanks,
188000	192640	this is the charity's way of saying thank you to everyone and give you all a progress report.
197680	203200	Since pot holder 54 started featuring Health and Harmony's work about a year ago,
203200	210080	175 of you have donated about 20,000 US dollars to Health and Harmony. So today we want to give
210080	215280	you special insight into how we're using those donations here in Borneo to improve the lives of
215280	220800	people, the ecosystem, this incredible rain forest and the planet. Thank you very much.
220800	227120	One of the ways your donations is making a difference here in Borneo is through our
227120	232960	chainsaw buyback program. August, how many chainsaws have you bought so far in the one
232960	243920	year old program? And why are you buying these chainsaws? What is the purpose of your program?
251440	256080	Fantastic. And you have, you have managed to buy back 65 chainsaws.
256080	263040	How many chainsaws do you want to buy? 150 units.
264480	272080	So 150 chainsaws is the target. And the reason is there are about 150 loggers left inside of
272080	278160	Borneo Island National Park. So it's not enough, August knows, just to buy the chainsaw. August
278160	285040	and his team are then training, mentoring, accompanying the logger and the logger's wife
285040	286960	in the development of a small business.
309040	315920	So we're not only just buying the chainsaw from the loggers, but we also start an alternative
315920	324960	livelihood for them so that they do not go back to logging. And you said that there's a decrease
325920	333760	with 89% decrease in illegal logging households in Gunung Palung. Actually the 11% remaining,
334400	341280	every one of them actually wants to stop logging. So by doing this chainsaw buyback program,
341280	346480	we're actually helping them to actually do what they want to do for the forest.
347120	354400	And, you know, Peter and Peter, your followers, Auto54 viewers, thank you so much. We can't do
354400	359920	this without you. We, Peter, we respect your work so much. We're climate change is concerned. We're
359920	366240	all big fans of yours and we're thrilled that some of your followers are now supporting our work
366240	371360	and we look forward to staying in touch. Thank you so much. Thank you. What I love about this
371360	376960	project is that it ticks two boxes for me. Most charities that deal with people's urgent medical
376960	382320	needs do little for the environment. Most environmental charities do little for people's
382320	389360	urgent medical needs. This project does both. The other reason I love it is that it works.
389360	394160	As you've seen, the rate of deforestation has plunged and the health of the population is much
394160	399440	better. I was with a group of doctors when they responded to one call where they managed to save
399440	405760	the life of a young girl. Areas that were once cleared of trees are now reforested and camera
405760	411920	traps show that animals and birds are back. Thanks in part to your donations, they've gone from being
411920	417840	a small clinic to a small hospital and hope to introduce this model in other countries.
417840	422480	But right now, they need money for a new truck and have put out an urgent appeal.
422480	426800	It's costing them time and money to keep fixing the old one, so if you can help,
426800	432560	please click on the links in the video description and donate. There are also links to my BBC report
432560	437760	on the project. On days when I don't feel up to working on videos for my channel, it really is
437760	444080	an incentive to know that every video I produce helps this important work and your donations force
444080	450320	me to get on with it. So come on, give me a boot up the backside. Even people who hate this channel
450320	451680	will want to do that.
