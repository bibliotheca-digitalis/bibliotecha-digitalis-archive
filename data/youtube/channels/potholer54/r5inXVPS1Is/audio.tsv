0	5280	So here I am, I'm outside Gloucester Royal Hospital just to show you how dead it is.
6160	10400	Okay Debbie, walk through the main entrance now. Point out again how dead it is.
10960	15120	Look, it's absolutely dead. Look, look, look at this.
22560	25680	Come on Debbie, say something like, where's the second wave?
26400	27840	Where's the second wave?
27840	28720	That's good.
28720	33600	Where's all the people dying from the second wave, hey? Where are they?
33600	34160	Even better.
36080	41280	All right, we've made the point here. Go back out and head for A&E. Let's show how dead it is.
42720	46080	Oh, can I get through to A&E this way? I don't think I can. Right,
46080	47680	I'm going to walk back outside again.
47680	49840	Oh for goodness sake, Debbie, it's not rocket science.
49840	58640	Oh, two people. I've literally seen about, I've got a scarf, sorry, I'm exempt actually.
59200	64720	You shouldn't be asking me. Yeah, yeah, you shouldn't be asking me about, about that.
64720	66960	Thank you. Bye. Thank you.
67680	69280	Tell her to piss off, Debbie.
69280	70240	None of your business.
72880	75760	Two stupid old women asking me why I'm not wearing a face covering.
75760	78000	Yeah, I heard. What a pair of bitches.
80720	82640	Okay, that's the door for A&E. Go on in.
83840	85360	Okay, so I'm going into A&E.
86960	88480	Don't forget to say there's no one there.
88480	89200	Just have a look.
91600	92480	Oh shit.
92480	96800	So we've got three, four, five, seven people in A&E.
96800	100480	Abort, abort. Make something up. Say there will be denied emergency treatment.
101440	104160	All the people being denied emergency treatment.
104160	104720	That'll work.
105360	109360	We'll have more on this fearless visit to a ghost hospital later.
110240	114720	No matter how obvious something is, there are always people willing to shut their eyes
114720	117840	and pretend they can't see whatever conflicts with their beliefs.
118400	122960	We've seen it in everything from creationists to flat earthers to climate contrarians.
123520	126400	But Covid-19 really seems to have brought this home.
127440	132880	So meet Ted Nugent, who got dressed up in camouflage gear to shut his eyes to the Covid-19
132880	133600	pandemic.
133600	136640	It's not a real pandemic and that's not a real vaccine. I'm sorry.
136640	140640	If you've never heard of Ted Nugent, he's a guitarist from, I don't know,
141440	146400	yesteryear. But these days he's amassed quite a following for statements like this.
146400	152480	Lying, scam, smoking mirrors, Covid-19 freaks.
153040	156880	And I'm going to stand six feet away from everybody. Are you that stupid?
157520	161120	Why weren't we shut down for Covid-1 through 18?
161120	167440	There was a Covid-1 and there was a Covid 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18.
167440	171520	Covid-1 through 18 didn't shut anything down, but whoa Covid-19.
171520	174240	If you're not already facepalming, let me explain.
174880	181680	Covid-19 is not the 19th incarnation of Covid. There was no Covid-1, 2, 3 and 4.
182240	186880	It's called Covid-19 because it's a disease caused by coronavirus
186880	190000	and it was first discovered in 2019.
190960	195680	Now there's nothing wrong with not knowing that or asking where the name Covid-19 comes from.
196240	203280	And 99% of us who might ask that question would simply google it and go to a reputable website
203280	209680	where the origin of the name is explained. That's exactly what I did and it took me all of 21
209680	216000	seconds to do that. But in the age of the internet, bloggers and video makers don't spend 21 seconds
216000	220880	finding the answer. Instead they spend 21 minutes setting up a camera,
220880	225280	spouting their beliefs into it and then uploading it for the world to pass on.
226320	230480	As I said in my video on lockdowns, I have no problem with people who want to argue that we
230480	236080	shouldn't lock down. That's an opinion. But opinions have to be based on an understanding
236080	242640	of the facts. And this wasn't. Now you may wonder why Nugent replaced his combat fatigues with a
242640	248960	bathrobe and isn't looking too well as he continued to argue that Covid-19 is a hoax.
249520	252160	Well, after a few days we found out why.
272640	283200	That's right. The virus he'd been claiming for months was a scam
283200	288720	from a pandemic that didn't exist, finally caught up with him and he contracted it himself.
289520	293360	But we're not done yet. Nugent explained that before he got tested,
293920	295680	he couldn't see the point in having a test.
302960	307200	Actually, some people do know what's in it. And if you can't even honestly answer our questions
307200	313600	of exactly what's in it and why are you testing it. If I test positive for the Chinese virus,
313600	320400	what will you do different for me than if I test negative? And all the doctors said, nothing.
323360	330000	And he said, what would be the good from knowing if you can't do anything different for me
330000	335520	if I test positive than if I test negative? You say it's good to know. What's the good?
337520	344160	If it's good to know, what good are you offering me? There's no good. It's not good to know.
344160	350000	There's nothing you're going to do. Goofballs. Actually, these are two separate questions and
350000	355440	they're good questions. But Nugent only gave the doctor's answer to the first one. What's the
355440	361680	answer to the second one? Well, the clue is in the question itself. If you can't do anything
361680	367680	different for me, what good are you offering me? If you're going to ask a good question,
367680	372640	then you have to be willing to listen to the answer. I'm sure the doctors told Nugent that
372640	378480	it's not always about me, me, me. It's important for someone to know if they're carrying the virus
378480	384480	not for their own sake, but for the sake of others around them. If they know they have COVID-19,
384480	388880	they can make sure they don't infect their wives, fathers, mothers, or uncles,
388880	394560	or the old woman living next door. It's like wearing a mask. It may not offer you much
394560	399600	protection, but it does offer protection for people around you, because it's not always
399600	405360	about me, me, me. Other people have the same rights and freedoms that you do. Get it?
406720	411200	One thing I do have to give Nugent credit for, at least when he got the diagnosis,
411200	416720	he did accept it. Some people have been so programmed to believe the pandemic is a hoax
416720	421600	that they can't even accept that they've got the disease. What? Even when they're struggling
421600	426400	for breath and dying in hospital, you might sceptically and somewhat dismissively inquire
426400	432080	in disbelief. Yeah, even then. And they don't want to believe that COVID is real. And the reason I
432080	437360	tweeted what I did is it wasn't one particular patient. It's just a culmination of so many
437360	444080	people. And their last dying words are, this can't be happening. It's not real.
444080	448400	Or when you try to reason with people of, can I call your family, your kids, your wife,
448400	453760	your friend, your brother? And they say, no, because I'm going to be fine. And you're watching
453760	459920	their oxygen levels maxed out on what we call Vapotherm at 100%. And their oxygen level might
459920	464880	be 75. That's not really that compatible with life. And we know where that's going to head.
465360	473840	And it just makes you sad and mad and frustrated. And then you know that you're just going to come
473840	478640	back and do it all over again. One other thing, because if Ted Nugent believes this stuff,
478640	483600	then I'm sure others believe it too. We haven't taken the vaccine. Nobody knows what's in it.
483600	487520	And if you can't even honestly answer our questions of exactly what's in it.
487520	492720	Pharmaceutical companies have told us what's in the vaccine. The information is freely available
492720	498720	online. Again, it only took 21 seconds to find it. Of course, if you believe there's a worldwide
498720	503360	conspiracy among pharmaceutical companies and health authorities to add an ingredient that
503360	507840	will poison you, then you have bigger problems than COVID-19 to worry about.
508960	511840	Talking of people who think the authorities are out to get them,
511840	517840	let's go back to that empty hospital video. I was led to it by a poster on my channel who echoed
517840	524480	the claim that COVID-19 isn't real because those videos of hospitals filled with COVID patients
524480	530560	are all fake. At first sight, the video does seem to show an empty hospital. Where are all the
530560	535920	COVID patients? Where are all these alleged ventilators and people supposedly struggling
535920	540720	to breathe and the doctors and nurses who claim they're worked off their feet trying to save lives?
541760	545600	Well, I checked by looking at a plan of the Gloucestershire Royal Hospital.
546240	550400	And it turns out that COVID patients are in a completely different building,
550400	556800	three floors up on Block C. The woman who took the video, Debbie Hicks, was filming the
556800	563520	outpatients department. How do I know? Firstly, because you can follow her route on the plan.
563520	568240	And secondly, because of one of the dumbest giveaways in the history of conspiracy theory
568240	574160	videos, she films a ticket machine marked outpatients check in. Gee, there's a clue.
575040	579840	COVID patients aren't brought into the outpatients building, that's the whole point of keeping
579840	586560	infectious patients separate. Not only that, it turns out Debbie did this stunt on December 28th,
586560	592880	which was a public holiday in the UK, so the outpatients department was closed. Debbie Hicks
592880	598000	would have known that, so this is where ignorance crosses over into deliberate misrepresentation.
599040	604000	By the way, I thought I'd save dozens of drama queens the trouble of writing posts like these
604080	608720	expressing outrage at how Debbie Hicks was later charged with a public order offence.
609760	617040	So no, she wasn't charged with denying COVID or for being true. No, it isn't against the law to
617040	623360	hold a belief. How is it a public order offence? Well, if the drama queens who think there's a law
623360	629920	in Britain making denying COVID or holding a belief illegal, just spend 21 seconds online
629920	635840	finding out what the public order offence was, she was charged with threatening or abusive words
635840	642080	or behaviour likely to cause harassment, alarm or distress when she allegedly lashed out at staff
642080	647200	after they asked her to stop filming, contrary to section 5 of the Public Order Act.
648480	653360	The reason filming isn't allowed in a hospital without permission is the same reason you can't
653360	658880	film inside a school, or a public toilet, or a gym changing room without permission.
658880	663360	It's not all about me, me, me. Other people have a right to privacy.
664480	669440	Don't worry, Debbie won't serve jail time or become a martyr. The most likely outcome,
669440	673040	if she's found guilty, is that she'll be bound over to keep the peace.
674240	678560	The thing is, you don't need to film an outpatient's department on a day it's closed
678560	682480	in order to convince people that hospitals have been seeing far fewer patients.
683120	688640	Just watch the evening news. It's hardly a secret, and there are very good reasons for it.
688720	692800	Vanessa Johnson has asthma as well as a history of pulmonary blood clots.
692800	696960	Her mother Sarah has multiple health issues. A few weeks ago they decided
696960	700800	during this Covid emergency to stay away from the emergency room.
701840	707040	One reason there's a drop in emergency room visits is because there are fewer traffic collisions.
707040	711120	In San Francisco alone the city is reporting that compared to last April,
711120	716000	this April, they're seeing a drop by 50% in traffic accidents.
716000	720880	Doctors have openly stated that they cancelled a lot of non-essential surgical procedures
720880	725040	and treatments in order to cope with the inundation of Covid cases.
725600	731680	At the same time, people who do have serious issues like heart problems and suspected cancers
731680	735600	have been urged by doctors to come in for diagnosis and treatment,
735600	740560	but they chose to stay away because they were afraid of catching Covid-19 in hospitals.
741520	746640	Now you may say, it's easy to debunk people like Ted Nugent and Debbie Hicks.
746640	751920	They're clearly not that bright. But in the end it doesn't matter whether this false information
751920	756720	is coming from people who left school without qualifications, or learned professors with
756720	761920	degrees up the ying yang. Politics doesn't matter either. Debbie Hicks was an active
761920	767440	member of a left-wing organisation, and Ted Nugent was an active member of a right-wing organisation.
768000	772880	It doesn't matter if the spreader of disinformation is an anonymous poster on a forum
772880	780000	or a goofy looking bloke in a beanie. But to some people it does matter. In my video on PCR,
780000	784560	no one contradicted my correction of a misquote on several anonymous blogs,
784560	789200	but when I showed what one of the bloggers actually looked like, and corrected him,
789200	794240	that caused outrage. You chose to debunk some barely literate guy making his video out of a
794240	799040	car in Australia. It's very easy to go for low hanging fruit, and I wouldn't be at all
799040	803520	surprised if Beanie Bloke is a shill putting on an act anyway. This is low hanging fruit
803520	809600	for a man of your standing. My standing? Checking information really isn't that hard,
809600	815280	so anyone who changes a quote or misrepresents a scientific paper is low hanging fruit.
816160	820960	Why would a claim by someone who looks one sandwich short of a picnic be very easy to
820960	826560	debunk, but for some reason the same claim made by a well-spoken graduate in a suit
826560	833120	is supposedly much harder to debunk? Is bullshit not bullshit because it's spouted by someone with
833120	838480	Professor in front of his name? Or Doctor? After doing this for 14 years I can tell you
838480	844320	that if anything these professors and PhDs are easier to debunk because they often state their
844320	850560	sources. And that makes it very easy to see how they've misread or misrepresented their own source.
851280	855520	With the bloggers and the Beanie Blokes you usually have to spend more time tracking their
855520	861280	sources down because they don't give them. It's not people I'm debunking, it's the crap they
861280	866320	spout, so it makes no difference whether the claimant is an anonymous person hiding behind
866320	872400	a blog, or someone on his front porch, or someone with a science degree in a slick video production
872400	878240	paid for by a lobby group, or an atmospheric physics professor, a solar physics professor,
878320	883440	a geochemistry professor, or a stratigraphy professor. It doesn't matter whether they're
883440	889120	amateurs dressing up to make their point, or professionals dressing up to make their point.
889120	895840	It doesn't matter whether exactly the same myth is spouted by a politician or by a twit with a PhD.
895840	902640	They're all low-hanging fruit because crap is crap. As long as they're spouting nonsense and
902640	906800	thousands or even millions of people unquestioningly believe what they say,
907360	909760	then I've been very happy to fact-check them all.
918000	923360	My channel doesn't ask for money, and unlike most YouTubers I don't make these videos for financial
923360	929040	gain. But since people have frequently asked if they can contribute something, I've suggested they
929040	934960	send money to an innovative charity called Health in Harmony. The charity's unique system of trading
935040	940160	healthcare for forest protection is now the subject of a peer-reviewed study from Stanford
940160	946880	University. It confirms that the model has resulted in 70% less deforestation in an important
946880	953920	national park, saving over 27 square kilometres of rainforest. The study also found that it's
953920	960240	provided cheap medical services for over 28,000 people who would otherwise have been cutting down
960240	966000	trees to pay for healthcare. The model is now being extended from the forests of Borneo
966000	971920	to Madagascar and Amazonia, funded in large part by contributions from my subscribers.
973200	978080	So whether you want to support a charity that protects forests, or one that saves animals,
978080	983840	or one that improves healthcare, now you can do all three. There's something in it for everyone.
