WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:05.280
So here I am, I'm outside Gloucester Royal Hospital just to show you how dead it is.

00:06.160 --> 00:10.400
Okay Debbie, walk through the main entrance now. Point out again how dead it is.

00:10.960 --> 00:15.120
Look, it's absolutely dead. Look, look, look at this.

00:22.560 --> 00:25.680
Come on Debbie, say something like, where's the second wave?

00:26.400 --> 00:27.840
Where's the second wave?

00:27.840 --> 00:28.720
That's good.

00:28.720 --> 00:33.600
Where's all the people dying from the second wave, hey? Where are they?

00:33.600 --> 00:34.160
Even better.

00:36.080 --> 00:41.280
All right, we've made the point here. Go back out and head for A&E. Let's show how dead it is.

00:42.720 --> 00:46.080
Oh, can I get through to A&E this way? I don't think I can. Right,

00:46.080 --> 00:47.680
I'm going to walk back outside again.

00:47.680 --> 00:49.840
Oh for goodness sake, Debbie, it's not rocket science.

00:49.840 --> 00:58.640
Oh, two people. I've literally seen about, I've got a scarf, sorry, I'm exempt actually.

00:59.200 --> 01:04.720
You shouldn't be asking me. Yeah, yeah, you shouldn't be asking me about, about that.

01:04.720 --> 01:06.960
Thank you. Bye. Thank you.

01:07.680 --> 01:09.280
Tell her to piss off, Debbie.

01:09.280 --> 01:10.240
None of your business.

01:12.880 --> 01:15.760
Two stupid old women asking me why I'm not wearing a face covering.

01:15.760 --> 01:18.000
Yeah, I heard. What a pair of bitches.

01:20.720 --> 01:22.640
Okay, that's the door for A&E. Go on in.

01:23.840 --> 01:25.360
Okay, so I'm going into A&E.

01:26.960 --> 01:28.480
Don't forget to say there's no one there.

01:28.480 --> 01:29.200
Just have a look.

01:31.600 --> 01:32.480
Oh shit.

01:32.480 --> 01:36.800
So we've got three, four, five, seven people in A&E.

01:36.800 --> 01:40.480
Abort, abort. Make something up. Say there will be denied emergency treatment.

01:41.440 --> 01:44.160
All the people being denied emergency treatment.

01:44.160 --> 01:44.720
That'll work.

01:45.360 --> 01:49.360
We'll have more on this fearless visit to a ghost hospital later.

01:50.240 --> 01:54.720
No matter how obvious something is, there are always people willing to shut their eyes

01:54.720 --> 01:57.840
and pretend they can't see whatever conflicts with their beliefs.

01:58.400 --> 02:02.960
We've seen it in everything from creationists to flat earthers to climate contrarians.

02:03.520 --> 02:06.400
But Covid-19 really seems to have brought this home.

02:07.440 --> 02:12.880
So meet Ted Nugent, who got dressed up in camouflage gear to shut his eyes to the Covid-19

02:12.880 --> 02:13.600
pandemic.

02:13.600 --> 02:16.640
It's not a real pandemic and that's not a real vaccine. I'm sorry.

02:16.640 --> 02:20.640
If you've never heard of Ted Nugent, he's a guitarist from, I don't know,

02:21.440 --> 02:26.400
yesteryear. But these days he's amassed quite a following for statements like this.

02:26.400 --> 02:32.480
Lying, scam, smoking mirrors, Covid-19 freaks.

02:33.040 --> 02:36.880
And I'm going to stand six feet away from everybody. Are you that stupid?

02:37.520 --> 02:41.120
Why weren't we shut down for Covid-1 through 18?

02:41.120 --> 02:47.440
There was a Covid-1 and there was a Covid 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18.

02:47.440 --> 02:51.520
Covid-1 through 18 didn't shut anything down, but whoa Covid-19.

02:51.520 --> 02:54.240
If you're not already facepalming, let me explain.

02:54.880 --> 03:01.680
Covid-19 is not the 19th incarnation of Covid. There was no Covid-1, 2, 3 and 4.

03:02.240 --> 03:06.880
It's called Covid-19 because it's a disease caused by coronavirus

03:06.880 --> 03:10.000
and it was first discovered in 2019.

03:10.960 --> 03:15.680
Now there's nothing wrong with not knowing that or asking where the name Covid-19 comes from.

03:16.240 --> 03:23.280
And 99% of us who might ask that question would simply google it and go to a reputable website

03:23.280 --> 03:29.680
where the origin of the name is explained. That's exactly what I did and it took me all of 21

03:29.680 --> 03:36.000
seconds to do that. But in the age of the internet, bloggers and video makers don't spend 21 seconds

03:36.000 --> 03:40.880
finding the answer. Instead they spend 21 minutes setting up a camera,

03:40.880 --> 03:45.280
spouting their beliefs into it and then uploading it for the world to pass on.

03:46.320 --> 03:50.480
As I said in my video on lockdowns, I have no problem with people who want to argue that we

03:50.480 --> 03:56.080
shouldn't lock down. That's an opinion. But opinions have to be based on an understanding

03:56.080 --> 04:02.640
of the facts. And this wasn't. Now you may wonder why Nugent replaced his combat fatigues with a

04:02.640 --> 04:08.960
bathrobe and isn't looking too well as he continued to argue that Covid-19 is a hoax.

04:09.520 --> 04:12.160
Well, after a few days we found out why.

04:32.640 --> 04:43.200
That's right. The virus he'd been claiming for months was a scam

04:43.200 --> 04:48.720
from a pandemic that didn't exist, finally caught up with him and he contracted it himself.

04:49.520 --> 04:53.360
But we're not done yet. Nugent explained that before he got tested,

04:53.920 --> 04:55.680
he couldn't see the point in having a test.

05:02.960 --> 05:07.200
Actually, some people do know what's in it. And if you can't even honestly answer our questions

05:07.200 --> 05:13.600
of exactly what's in it and why are you testing it. If I test positive for the Chinese virus,

05:13.600 --> 05:20.400
what will you do different for me than if I test negative? And all the doctors said, nothing.

05:23.360 --> 05:30.000
And he said, what would be the good from knowing if you can't do anything different for me

05:30.000 --> 05:35.520
if I test positive than if I test negative? You say it's good to know. What's the good?

05:37.520 --> 05:44.160
If it's good to know, what good are you offering me? There's no good. It's not good to know.

05:44.160 --> 05:50.000
There's nothing you're going to do. Goofballs. Actually, these are two separate questions and

05:50.000 --> 05:55.440
they're good questions. But Nugent only gave the doctor's answer to the first one. What's the

05:55.440 --> 06:01.680
answer to the second one? Well, the clue is in the question itself. If you can't do anything

06:01.680 --> 06:07.680
different for me, what good are you offering me? If you're going to ask a good question,

06:07.680 --> 06:12.640
then you have to be willing to listen to the answer. I'm sure the doctors told Nugent that

06:12.640 --> 06:18.480
it's not always about me, me, me. It's important for someone to know if they're carrying the virus

06:18.480 --> 06:24.480
not for their own sake, but for the sake of others around them. If they know they have COVID-19,

06:24.480 --> 06:28.880
they can make sure they don't infect their wives, fathers, mothers, or uncles,

06:28.880 --> 06:34.560
or the old woman living next door. It's like wearing a mask. It may not offer you much

06:34.560 --> 06:39.600
protection, but it does offer protection for people around you, because it's not always

06:39.600 --> 06:45.360
about me, me, me. Other people have the same rights and freedoms that you do. Get it?

06:46.720 --> 06:51.200
One thing I do have to give Nugent credit for, at least when he got the diagnosis,

06:51.200 --> 06:56.720
he did accept it. Some people have been so programmed to believe the pandemic is a hoax

06:56.720 --> 07:01.600
that they can't even accept that they've got the disease. What? Even when they're struggling

07:01.600 --> 07:06.400
for breath and dying in hospital, you might sceptically and somewhat dismissively inquire

07:06.400 --> 07:12.080
in disbelief. Yeah, even then. And they don't want to believe that COVID is real. And the reason I

07:12.080 --> 07:17.360
tweeted what I did is it wasn't one particular patient. It's just a culmination of so many

07:17.360 --> 07:24.080
people. And their last dying words are, this can't be happening. It's not real.

07:24.080 --> 07:28.400
Or when you try to reason with people of, can I call your family, your kids, your wife,

07:28.400 --> 07:33.760
your friend, your brother? And they say, no, because I'm going to be fine. And you're watching

07:33.760 --> 07:39.920
their oxygen levels maxed out on what we call Vapotherm at 100%. And their oxygen level might

07:39.920 --> 07:44.880
be 75. That's not really that compatible with life. And we know where that's going to head.

07:45.360 --> 07:53.840
And it just makes you sad and mad and frustrated. And then you know that you're just going to come

07:53.840 --> 07:58.640
back and do it all over again. One other thing, because if Ted Nugent believes this stuff,

07:58.640 --> 08:03.600
then I'm sure others believe it too. We haven't taken the vaccine. Nobody knows what's in it.

08:03.600 --> 08:07.520
And if you can't even honestly answer our questions of exactly what's in it.

08:07.520 --> 08:12.720
Pharmaceutical companies have told us what's in the vaccine. The information is freely available

08:12.720 --> 08:18.720
online. Again, it only took 21 seconds to find it. Of course, if you believe there's a worldwide

08:18.720 --> 08:23.360
conspiracy among pharmaceutical companies and health authorities to add an ingredient that

08:23.360 --> 08:27.840
will poison you, then you have bigger problems than COVID-19 to worry about.

08:28.960 --> 08:31.840
Talking of people who think the authorities are out to get them,

08:31.840 --> 08:37.840
let's go back to that empty hospital video. I was led to it by a poster on my channel who echoed

08:37.840 --> 08:44.480
the claim that COVID-19 isn't real because those videos of hospitals filled with COVID patients

08:44.480 --> 08:50.560
are all fake. At first sight, the video does seem to show an empty hospital. Where are all the

08:50.560 --> 08:55.920
COVID patients? Where are all these alleged ventilators and people supposedly struggling

08:55.920 --> 09:00.720
to breathe and the doctors and nurses who claim they're worked off their feet trying to save lives?

09:01.760 --> 09:05.600
Well, I checked by looking at a plan of the Gloucestershire Royal Hospital.

09:06.240 --> 09:10.400
And it turns out that COVID patients are in a completely different building,

09:10.400 --> 09:16.800
three floors up on Block C. The woman who took the video, Debbie Hicks, was filming the

09:16.800 --> 09:23.520
outpatients department. How do I know? Firstly, because you can follow her route on the plan.

09:23.520 --> 09:28.240
And secondly, because of one of the dumbest giveaways in the history of conspiracy theory

09:28.240 --> 09:34.160
videos, she films a ticket machine marked outpatients check in. Gee, there's a clue.

09:35.040 --> 09:39.840
COVID patients aren't brought into the outpatients building, that's the whole point of keeping

09:39.840 --> 09:46.560
infectious patients separate. Not only that, it turns out Debbie did this stunt on December 28th,

09:46.560 --> 09:52.880
which was a public holiday in the UK, so the outpatients department was closed. Debbie Hicks

09:52.880 --> 09:58.000
would have known that, so this is where ignorance crosses over into deliberate misrepresentation.

09:59.040 --> 10:04.000
By the way, I thought I'd save dozens of drama queens the trouble of writing posts like these

10:04.080 --> 10:08.720
expressing outrage at how Debbie Hicks was later charged with a public order offence.

10:09.760 --> 10:17.040
So no, she wasn't charged with denying COVID or for being true. No, it isn't against the law to

10:17.040 --> 10:23.360
hold a belief. How is it a public order offence? Well, if the drama queens who think there's a law

10:23.360 --> 10:29.920
in Britain making denying COVID or holding a belief illegal, just spend 21 seconds online

10:29.920 --> 10:35.840
finding out what the public order offence was, she was charged with threatening or abusive words

10:35.840 --> 10:42.080
or behaviour likely to cause harassment, alarm or distress when she allegedly lashed out at staff

10:42.080 --> 10:47.200
after they asked her to stop filming, contrary to section 5 of the Public Order Act.

10:48.480 --> 10:53.360
The reason filming isn't allowed in a hospital without permission is the same reason you can't

10:53.360 --> 10:58.880
film inside a school, or a public toilet, or a gym changing room without permission.

10:58.880 --> 11:03.360
It's not all about me, me, me. Other people have a right to privacy.

11:04.480 --> 11:09.440
Don't worry, Debbie won't serve jail time or become a martyr. The most likely outcome,

11:09.440 --> 11:13.040
if she's found guilty, is that she'll be bound over to keep the peace.

11:14.240 --> 11:18.560
The thing is, you don't need to film an outpatient's department on a day it's closed

11:18.560 --> 11:22.480
in order to convince people that hospitals have been seeing far fewer patients.

11:23.120 --> 11:28.640
Just watch the evening news. It's hardly a secret, and there are very good reasons for it.

11:28.720 --> 11:32.800
Vanessa Johnson has asthma as well as a history of pulmonary blood clots.

11:32.800 --> 11:36.960
Her mother Sarah has multiple health issues. A few weeks ago they decided

11:36.960 --> 11:40.800
during this Covid emergency to stay away from the emergency room.

11:41.840 --> 11:47.040
One reason there's a drop in emergency room visits is because there are fewer traffic collisions.

11:47.040 --> 11:51.120
In San Francisco alone the city is reporting that compared to last April,

11:51.120 --> 11:56.000
this April, they're seeing a drop by 50% in traffic accidents.

11:56.000 --> 12:00.880
Doctors have openly stated that they cancelled a lot of non-essential surgical procedures

12:00.880 --> 12:05.040
and treatments in order to cope with the inundation of Covid cases.

12:05.600 --> 12:11.680
At the same time, people who do have serious issues like heart problems and suspected cancers

12:11.680 --> 12:15.600
have been urged by doctors to come in for diagnosis and treatment,

12:15.600 --> 12:20.560
but they chose to stay away because they were afraid of catching Covid-19 in hospitals.

12:21.520 --> 12:26.640
Now you may say, it's easy to debunk people like Ted Nugent and Debbie Hicks.

12:26.640 --> 12:31.920
They're clearly not that bright. But in the end it doesn't matter whether this false information

12:31.920 --> 12:36.720
is coming from people who left school without qualifications, or learned professors with

12:36.720 --> 12:41.920
degrees up the ying yang. Politics doesn't matter either. Debbie Hicks was an active

12:41.920 --> 12:47.440
member of a left-wing organisation, and Ted Nugent was an active member of a right-wing organisation.

12:48.000 --> 12:52.880
It doesn't matter if the spreader of disinformation is an anonymous poster on a forum

12:52.880 --> 13:00.000
or a goofy looking bloke in a beanie. But to some people it does matter. In my video on PCR,

13:00.000 --> 13:04.560
no one contradicted my correction of a misquote on several anonymous blogs,

13:04.560 --> 13:09.200
but when I showed what one of the bloggers actually looked like, and corrected him,

13:09.200 --> 13:14.240
that caused outrage. You chose to debunk some barely literate guy making his video out of a

13:14.240 --> 13:19.040
car in Australia. It's very easy to go for low hanging fruit, and I wouldn't be at all

13:19.040 --> 13:23.520
surprised if Beanie Bloke is a shill putting on an act anyway. This is low hanging fruit

13:23.520 --> 13:29.600
for a man of your standing. My standing? Checking information really isn't that hard,

13:29.600 --> 13:35.280
so anyone who changes a quote or misrepresents a scientific paper is low hanging fruit.

13:36.160 --> 13:40.960
Why would a claim by someone who looks one sandwich short of a picnic be very easy to

13:40.960 --> 13:46.560
debunk, but for some reason the same claim made by a well-spoken graduate in a suit

13:46.560 --> 13:53.120
is supposedly much harder to debunk? Is bullshit not bullshit because it's spouted by someone with

13:53.120 --> 13:58.480
Professor in front of his name? Or Doctor? After doing this for 14 years I can tell you

13:58.480 --> 14:04.320
that if anything these professors and PhDs are easier to debunk because they often state their

14:04.320 --> 14:10.560
sources. And that makes it very easy to see how they've misread or misrepresented their own source.

14:11.280 --> 14:15.520
With the bloggers and the Beanie Blokes you usually have to spend more time tracking their

14:15.520 --> 14:21.280
sources down because they don't give them. It's not people I'm debunking, it's the crap they

14:21.280 --> 14:26.320
spout, so it makes no difference whether the claimant is an anonymous person hiding behind

14:26.320 --> 14:32.400
a blog, or someone on his front porch, or someone with a science degree in a slick video production

14:32.400 --> 14:38.240
paid for by a lobby group, or an atmospheric physics professor, a solar physics professor,

14:38.320 --> 14:43.440
a geochemistry professor, or a stratigraphy professor. It doesn't matter whether they're

14:43.440 --> 14:49.120
amateurs dressing up to make their point, or professionals dressing up to make their point.

14:49.120 --> 14:55.840
It doesn't matter whether exactly the same myth is spouted by a politician or by a twit with a PhD.

14:55.840 --> 15:02.640
They're all low-hanging fruit because crap is crap. As long as they're spouting nonsense and

15:02.640 --> 15:06.800
thousands or even millions of people unquestioningly believe what they say,

15:07.360 --> 15:09.760
then I've been very happy to fact-check them all.

15:18.000 --> 15:23.360
My channel doesn't ask for money, and unlike most YouTubers I don't make these videos for financial

15:23.360 --> 15:29.040
gain. But since people have frequently asked if they can contribute something, I've suggested they

15:29.040 --> 15:34.960
send money to an innovative charity called Health in Harmony. The charity's unique system of trading

15:35.040 --> 15:40.160
healthcare for forest protection is now the subject of a peer-reviewed study from Stanford

15:40.160 --> 15:46.880
University. It confirms that the model has resulted in 70% less deforestation in an important

15:46.880 --> 15:53.920
national park, saving over 27 square kilometres of rainforest. The study also found that it's

15:53.920 --> 16:00.240
provided cheap medical services for over 28,000 people who would otherwise have been cutting down

16:00.240 --> 16:06.000
trees to pay for healthcare. The model is now being extended from the forests of Borneo

16:06.000 --> 16:11.920
to Madagascar and Amazonia, funded in large part by contributions from my subscribers.

16:13.200 --> 16:18.080
So whether you want to support a charity that protects forests, or one that saves animals,

16:18.080 --> 16:23.840
or one that improves healthcare, now you can do all three. There's something in it for everyone.
