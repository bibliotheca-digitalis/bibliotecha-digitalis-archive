1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,280
So here I am, I'm outside Gloucester Royal Hospital just to show you how dead it is.

2
00:00:06,160 --> 00:00:10,400
Okay Debbie, walk through the main entrance now. Point out again how dead it is.

3
00:00:10,960 --> 00:00:15,120
Look, it's absolutely dead. Look, look, look at this.

4
00:00:22,560 --> 00:00:25,680
Come on Debbie, say something like, where's the second wave?

5
00:00:26,400 --> 00:00:27,840
Where's the second wave?

6
00:00:27,840 --> 00:00:28,720
That's good.

7
00:00:28,720 --> 00:00:33,600
Where's all the people dying from the second wave, hey? Where are they?

8
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:34,160
Even better.

9
00:00:36,080 --> 00:00:41,280
All right, we've made the point here. Go back out and head for A&E. Let's show how dead it is.

10
00:00:42,720 --> 00:00:46,080
Oh, can I get through to A&E this way? I don't think I can. Right,

11
00:00:46,080 --> 00:00:47,680
I'm going to walk back outside again.

12
00:00:47,680 --> 00:00:49,840
Oh for goodness sake, Debbie, it's not rocket science.

13
00:00:49,840 --> 00:00:58,640
Oh, two people. I've literally seen about, I've got a scarf, sorry, I'm exempt actually.

14
00:00:59,200 --> 00:01:04,720
You shouldn't be asking me. Yeah, yeah, you shouldn't be asking me about, about that.

15
00:01:04,720 --> 00:01:06,960
Thank you. Bye. Thank you.

16
00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:09,280
Tell her to piss off, Debbie.

17
00:01:09,280 --> 00:01:10,240
None of your business.

18
00:01:12,880 --> 00:01:15,760
Two stupid old women asking me why I'm not wearing a face covering.

19
00:01:15,760 --> 00:01:18,000
Yeah, I heard. What a pair of bitches.

20
00:01:20,720 --> 00:01:22,640
Okay, that's the door for A&E. Go on in.

21
00:01:23,840 --> 00:01:25,360
Okay, so I'm going into A&E.

22
00:01:26,960 --> 00:01:28,480
Don't forget to say there's no one there.

23
00:01:28,480 --> 00:01:29,200
Just have a look.

24
00:01:31,600 --> 00:01:32,480
Oh shit.

25
00:01:32,480 --> 00:01:36,800
So we've got three, four, five, seven people in A&E.

26
00:01:36,800 --> 00:01:40,480
Abort, abort. Make something up. Say there will be denied emergency treatment.

27
00:01:41,440 --> 00:01:44,160
All the people being denied emergency treatment.

28
00:01:44,160 --> 00:01:44,720
That'll work.

29
00:01:45,360 --> 00:01:49,360
We'll have more on this fearless visit to a ghost hospital later.

30
00:01:50,240 --> 00:01:54,720
No matter how obvious something is, there are always people willing to shut their eyes

31
00:01:54,720 --> 00:01:57,840
and pretend they can't see whatever conflicts with their beliefs.

32
00:01:58,400 --> 00:02:02,960
We've seen it in everything from creationists to flat earthers to climate contrarians.

33
00:02:03,520 --> 00:02:06,400
But Covid-19 really seems to have brought this home.

34
00:02:07,440 --> 00:02:12,880
So meet Ted Nugent, who got dressed up in camouflage gear to shut his eyes to the Covid-19

35
00:02:12,880 --> 00:02:13,600
pandemic.

36
00:02:13,600 --> 00:02:16,640
It's not a real pandemic and that's not a real vaccine. I'm sorry.

37
00:02:16,640 --> 00:02:20,640
If you've never heard of Ted Nugent, he's a guitarist from, I don't know,

38
00:02:21,440 --> 00:02:26,400
yesteryear. But these days he's amassed quite a following for statements like this.

39
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:32,480
Lying, scam, smoking mirrors, Covid-19 freaks.

40
00:02:33,040 --> 00:02:36,880
And I'm going to stand six feet away from everybody. Are you that stupid?

41
00:02:37,520 --> 00:02:41,120
Why weren't we shut down for Covid-1 through 18?

42
00:02:41,120 --> 00:02:47,440
There was a Covid-1 and there was a Covid 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18.

43
00:02:47,440 --> 00:02:51,520
Covid-1 through 18 didn't shut anything down, but whoa Covid-19.

44
00:02:51,520 --> 00:02:54,240
If you're not already facepalming, let me explain.

45
00:02:54,880 --> 00:03:01,680
Covid-19 is not the 19th incarnation of Covid. There was no Covid-1, 2, 3 and 4.

46
00:03:02,240 --> 00:03:06,880
It's called Covid-19 because it's a disease caused by coronavirus

47
00:03:06,880 --> 00:03:10,000
and it was first discovered in 2019.

48
00:03:10,960 --> 00:03:15,680
Now there's nothing wrong with not knowing that or asking where the name Covid-19 comes from.

49
00:03:16,240 --> 00:03:23,280
And 99% of us who might ask that question would simply google it and go to a reputable website

50
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:29,680
where the origin of the name is explained. That's exactly what I did and it took me all of 21

51
00:03:29,680 --> 00:03:36,000
seconds to do that. But in the age of the internet, bloggers and video makers don't spend 21 seconds

52
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:40,880
finding the answer. Instead they spend 21 minutes setting up a camera,

53
00:03:40,880 --> 00:03:45,280
spouting their beliefs into it and then uploading it for the world to pass on.

54
00:03:46,320 --> 00:03:50,480
As I said in my video on lockdowns, I have no problem with people who want to argue that we

55
00:03:50,480 --> 00:03:56,080
shouldn't lock down. That's an opinion. But opinions have to be based on an understanding

56
00:03:56,080 --> 00:04:02,640
of the facts. And this wasn't. Now you may wonder why Nugent replaced his combat fatigues with a

57
00:04:02,640 --> 00:04:08,960
bathrobe and isn't looking too well as he continued to argue that Covid-19 is a hoax.

58
00:04:09,520 --> 00:04:12,160
Well, after a few days we found out why.

59
00:04:32,640 --> 00:04:43,200
That's right. The virus he'd been claiming for months was a scam

60
00:04:43,200 --> 00:04:48,720
from a pandemic that didn't exist, finally caught up with him and he contracted it himself.

61
00:04:49,520 --> 00:04:53,360
But we're not done yet. Nugent explained that before he got tested,

62
00:04:53,920 --> 00:04:55,680
he couldn't see the point in having a test.

63
00:05:02,960 --> 00:05:07,200
Actually, some people do know what's in it. And if you can't even honestly answer our questions

64
00:05:07,200 --> 00:05:13,600
of exactly what's in it and why are you testing it. If I test positive for the Chinese virus,

65
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:20,400
what will you do different for me than if I test negative? And all the doctors said, nothing.

66
00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:30,000
And he said, what would be the good from knowing if you can't do anything different for me

67
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:35,520
if I test positive than if I test negative? You say it's good to know. What's the good?

68
00:05:37,520 --> 00:05:44,160
If it's good to know, what good are you offering me? There's no good. It's not good to know.

69
00:05:44,160 --> 00:05:50,000
There's nothing you're going to do. Goofballs. Actually, these are two separate questions and

70
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:55,440
they're good questions. But Nugent only gave the doctor's answer to the first one. What's the

71
00:05:55,440 --> 00:06:01,680
answer to the second one? Well, the clue is in the question itself. If you can't do anything

72
00:06:01,680 --> 00:06:07,680
different for me, what good are you offering me? If you're going to ask a good question,

73
00:06:07,680 --> 00:06:12,640
then you have to be willing to listen to the answer. I'm sure the doctors told Nugent that

74
00:06:12,640 --> 00:06:18,480
it's not always about me, me, me. It's important for someone to know if they're carrying the virus

75
00:06:18,480 --> 00:06:24,480
not for their own sake, but for the sake of others around them. If they know they have COVID-19,

76
00:06:24,480 --> 00:06:28,880
they can make sure they don't infect their wives, fathers, mothers, or uncles,

77
00:06:28,880 --> 00:06:34,560
or the old woman living next door. It's like wearing a mask. It may not offer you much

78
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:39,600
protection, but it does offer protection for people around you, because it's not always

79
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:45,360
about me, me, me. Other people have the same rights and freedoms that you do. Get it?

80
00:06:46,720 --> 00:06:51,200
One thing I do have to give Nugent credit for, at least when he got the diagnosis,

81
00:06:51,200 --> 00:06:56,720
he did accept it. Some people have been so programmed to believe the pandemic is a hoax

82
00:06:56,720 --> 00:07:01,600
that they can't even accept that they've got the disease. What? Even when they're struggling

83
00:07:01,600 --> 00:07:06,400
for breath and dying in hospital, you might sceptically and somewhat dismissively inquire

84
00:07:06,400 --> 00:07:12,080
in disbelief. Yeah, even then. And they don't want to believe that COVID is real. And the reason I

85
00:07:12,080 --> 00:07:17,360
tweeted what I did is it wasn't one particular patient. It's just a culmination of so many

86
00:07:17,360 --> 00:07:24,080
people. And their last dying words are, this can't be happening. It's not real.

87
00:07:24,080 --> 00:07:28,400
Or when you try to reason with people of, can I call your family, your kids, your wife,

88
00:07:28,400 --> 00:07:33,760
your friend, your brother? And they say, no, because I'm going to be fine. And you're watching

89
00:07:33,760 --> 00:07:39,920
their oxygen levels maxed out on what we call Vapotherm at 100%. And their oxygen level might

90
00:07:39,920 --> 00:07:44,880
be 75. That's not really that compatible with life. And we know where that's going to head.

91
00:07:45,360 --> 00:07:53,840
And it just makes you sad and mad and frustrated. And then you know that you're just going to come

92
00:07:53,840 --> 00:07:58,640
back and do it all over again. One other thing, because if Ted Nugent believes this stuff,

93
00:07:58,640 --> 00:08:03,600
then I'm sure others believe it too. We haven't taken the vaccine. Nobody knows what's in it.

94
00:08:03,600 --> 00:08:07,520
And if you can't even honestly answer our questions of exactly what's in it.

95
00:08:07,520 --> 00:08:12,720
Pharmaceutical companies have told us what's in the vaccine. The information is freely available

96
00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:18,720
online. Again, it only took 21 seconds to find it. Of course, if you believe there's a worldwide

97
00:08:18,720 --> 00:08:23,360
conspiracy among pharmaceutical companies and health authorities to add an ingredient that

98
00:08:23,360 --> 00:08:27,840
will poison you, then you have bigger problems than COVID-19 to worry about.

99
00:08:28,960 --> 00:08:31,840
Talking of people who think the authorities are out to get them,

100
00:08:31,840 --> 00:08:37,840
let's go back to that empty hospital video. I was led to it by a poster on my channel who echoed

101
00:08:37,840 --> 00:08:44,480
the claim that COVID-19 isn't real because those videos of hospitals filled with COVID patients

102
00:08:44,480 --> 00:08:50,560
are all fake. At first sight, the video does seem to show an empty hospital. Where are all the

103
00:08:50,560 --> 00:08:55,920
COVID patients? Where are all these alleged ventilators and people supposedly struggling

104
00:08:55,920 --> 00:09:00,720
to breathe and the doctors and nurses who claim they're worked off their feet trying to save lives?

105
00:09:01,760 --> 00:09:05,600
Well, I checked by looking at a plan of the Gloucestershire Royal Hospital.

106
00:09:06,240 --> 00:09:10,400
And it turns out that COVID patients are in a completely different building,

107
00:09:10,400 --> 00:09:16,800
three floors up on Block C. The woman who took the video, Debbie Hicks, was filming the

108
00:09:16,800 --> 00:09:23,520
outpatients department. How do I know? Firstly, because you can follow her route on the plan.

109
00:09:23,520 --> 00:09:28,240
And secondly, because of one of the dumbest giveaways in the history of conspiracy theory

110
00:09:28,240 --> 00:09:34,160
videos, she films a ticket machine marked outpatients check in. Gee, there's a clue.

111
00:09:35,040 --> 00:09:39,840
COVID patients aren't brought into the outpatients building, that's the whole point of keeping

112
00:09:39,840 --> 00:09:46,560
infectious patients separate. Not only that, it turns out Debbie did this stunt on December 28th,

113
00:09:46,560 --> 00:09:52,880
which was a public holiday in the UK, so the outpatients department was closed. Debbie Hicks

114
00:09:52,880 --> 00:09:58,000
would have known that, so this is where ignorance crosses over into deliberate misrepresentation.

115
00:09:59,040 --> 00:10:04,000
By the way, I thought I'd save dozens of drama queens the trouble of writing posts like these

116
00:10:04,080 --> 00:10:08,720
expressing outrage at how Debbie Hicks was later charged with a public order offence.

117
00:10:09,760 --> 00:10:17,040
So no, she wasn't charged with denying COVID or for being true. No, it isn't against the law to

118
00:10:17,040 --> 00:10:23,360
hold a belief. How is it a public order offence? Well, if the drama queens who think there's a law

119
00:10:23,360 --> 00:10:29,920
in Britain making denying COVID or holding a belief illegal, just spend 21 seconds online

120
00:10:29,920 --> 00:10:35,840
finding out what the public order offence was, she was charged with threatening or abusive words

121
00:10:35,840 --> 00:10:42,080
or behaviour likely to cause harassment, alarm or distress when she allegedly lashed out at staff

122
00:10:42,080 --> 00:10:47,200
after they asked her to stop filming, contrary to section 5 of the Public Order Act.

123
00:10:48,480 --> 00:10:53,360
The reason filming isn't allowed in a hospital without permission is the same reason you can't

124
00:10:53,360 --> 00:10:58,880
film inside a school, or a public toilet, or a gym changing room without permission.

125
00:10:58,880 --> 00:11:03,360
It's not all about me, me, me. Other people have a right to privacy.

126
00:11:04,480 --> 00:11:09,440
Don't worry, Debbie won't serve jail time or become a martyr. The most likely outcome,

127
00:11:09,440 --> 00:11:13,040
if she's found guilty, is that she'll be bound over to keep the peace.

128
00:11:14,240 --> 00:11:18,560
The thing is, you don't need to film an outpatient's department on a day it's closed

129
00:11:18,560 --> 00:11:22,480
in order to convince people that hospitals have been seeing far fewer patients.

130
00:11:23,120 --> 00:11:28,640
Just watch the evening news. It's hardly a secret, and there are very good reasons for it.

131
00:11:28,720 --> 00:11:32,800
Vanessa Johnson has asthma as well as a history of pulmonary blood clots.

132
00:11:32,800 --> 00:11:36,960
Her mother Sarah has multiple health issues. A few weeks ago they decided

133
00:11:36,960 --> 00:11:40,800
during this Covid emergency to stay away from the emergency room.

134
00:11:41,840 --> 00:11:47,040
One reason there's a drop in emergency room visits is because there are fewer traffic collisions.

135
00:11:47,040 --> 00:11:51,120
In San Francisco alone the city is reporting that compared to last April,

136
00:11:51,120 --> 00:11:56,000
this April, they're seeing a drop by 50% in traffic accidents.

137
00:11:56,000 --> 00:12:00,880
Doctors have openly stated that they cancelled a lot of non-essential surgical procedures

138
00:12:00,880 --> 00:12:05,040
and treatments in order to cope with the inundation of Covid cases.

139
00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:11,680
At the same time, people who do have serious issues like heart problems and suspected cancers

140
00:12:11,680 --> 00:12:15,600
have been urged by doctors to come in for diagnosis and treatment,

141
00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:20,560
but they chose to stay away because they were afraid of catching Covid-19 in hospitals.

142
00:12:21,520 --> 00:12:26,640
Now you may say, it's easy to debunk people like Ted Nugent and Debbie Hicks.

143
00:12:26,640 --> 00:12:31,920
They're clearly not that bright. But in the end it doesn't matter whether this false information

144
00:12:31,920 --> 00:12:36,720
is coming from people who left school without qualifications, or learned professors with

145
00:12:36,720 --> 00:12:41,920
degrees up the ying yang. Politics doesn't matter either. Debbie Hicks was an active

146
00:12:41,920 --> 00:12:47,440
member of a left-wing organisation, and Ted Nugent was an active member of a right-wing organisation.

147
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:52,880
It doesn't matter if the spreader of disinformation is an anonymous poster on a forum

148
00:12:52,880 --> 00:13:00,000
or a goofy looking bloke in a beanie. But to some people it does matter. In my video on PCR,

149
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:04,560
no one contradicted my correction of a misquote on several anonymous blogs,

150
00:13:04,560 --> 00:13:09,200
but when I showed what one of the bloggers actually looked like, and corrected him,

151
00:13:09,200 --> 00:13:14,240
that caused outrage. You chose to debunk some barely literate guy making his video out of a

152
00:13:14,240 --> 00:13:19,040
car in Australia. It's very easy to go for low hanging fruit, and I wouldn't be at all

153
00:13:19,040 --> 00:13:23,520
surprised if Beanie Bloke is a shill putting on an act anyway. This is low hanging fruit

154
00:13:23,520 --> 00:13:29,600
for a man of your standing. My standing? Checking information really isn't that hard,

155
00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:35,280
so anyone who changes a quote or misrepresents a scientific paper is low hanging fruit.

156
00:13:36,160 --> 00:13:40,960
Why would a claim by someone who looks one sandwich short of a picnic be very easy to

157
00:13:40,960 --> 00:13:46,560
debunk, but for some reason the same claim made by a well-spoken graduate in a suit

158
00:13:46,560 --> 00:13:53,120
is supposedly much harder to debunk? Is bullshit not bullshit because it's spouted by someone with

159
00:13:53,120 --> 00:13:58,480
Professor in front of his name? Or Doctor? After doing this for 14 years I can tell you

160
00:13:58,480 --> 00:14:04,320
that if anything these professors and PhDs are easier to debunk because they often state their

161
00:14:04,320 --> 00:14:10,560
sources. And that makes it very easy to see how they've misread or misrepresented their own source.

162
00:14:11,280 --> 00:14:15,520
With the bloggers and the Beanie Blokes you usually have to spend more time tracking their

163
00:14:15,520 --> 00:14:21,280
sources down because they don't give them. It's not people I'm debunking, it's the crap they

164
00:14:21,280 --> 00:14:26,320
spout, so it makes no difference whether the claimant is an anonymous person hiding behind

165
00:14:26,320 --> 00:14:32,400
a blog, or someone on his front porch, or someone with a science degree in a slick video production

166
00:14:32,400 --> 00:14:38,240
paid for by a lobby group, or an atmospheric physics professor, a solar physics professor,

167
00:14:38,320 --> 00:14:43,440
a geochemistry professor, or a stratigraphy professor. It doesn't matter whether they're

168
00:14:43,440 --> 00:14:49,120
amateurs dressing up to make their point, or professionals dressing up to make their point.

169
00:14:49,120 --> 00:14:55,840
It doesn't matter whether exactly the same myth is spouted by a politician or by a twit with a PhD.

170
00:14:55,840 --> 00:15:02,640
They're all low-hanging fruit because crap is crap. As long as they're spouting nonsense and

171
00:15:02,640 --> 00:15:06,800
thousands or even millions of people unquestioningly believe what they say,

172
00:15:07,360 --> 00:15:09,760
then I've been very happy to fact-check them all.

173
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:23,360
My channel doesn't ask for money, and unlike most YouTubers I don't make these videos for financial

174
00:15:23,360 --> 00:15:29,040
gain. But since people have frequently asked if they can contribute something, I've suggested they

175
00:15:29,040 --> 00:15:34,960
send money to an innovative charity called Health in Harmony. The charity's unique system of trading

176
00:15:35,040 --> 00:15:40,160
healthcare for forest protection is now the subject of a peer-reviewed study from Stanford

177
00:15:40,160 --> 00:15:46,880
University. It confirms that the model has resulted in 70% less deforestation in an important

178
00:15:46,880 --> 00:15:53,920
national park, saving over 27 square kilometres of rainforest. The study also found that it's

179
00:15:53,920 --> 00:16:00,240
provided cheap medical services for over 28,000 people who would otherwise have been cutting down

180
00:16:00,240 --> 00:16:06,000
trees to pay for healthcare. The model is now being extended from the forests of Borneo

181
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:11,920
to Madagascar and Amazonia, funded in large part by contributions from my subscribers.

182
00:16:13,200 --> 00:16:18,080
So whether you want to support a charity that protects forests, or one that saves animals,

183
00:16:18,080 --> 00:16:23,840
or one that improves healthcare, now you can do all three. There's something in it for everyone.
