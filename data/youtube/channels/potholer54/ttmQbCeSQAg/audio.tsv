0	5680	the first half of the discussion I had with Ben Davidson, aka Suspicious Observers. This came out
5680	11520	of his claims that I'd lied and deliberately misrepresented one of his videos, and his call
11520	18000	for a live debate on my alleged misdeeds. Two days before we were due to talk, Ben told me it wasn't
18000	24080	going out live after all, and I had no time to get that organised from my side. So I asked Ben to send
24080	29040	me the audio file, which he very kindly did, and I'd been matching it to the images I was showing
29040	34240	him during our discussion. Since the discussion I've also fact-checked some of his claims that
34240	39120	I couldn't check in the middle of the discussion, and also added a couple of graphics to illustrate
39120	44560	what we're talking about. I make it very clear when these are added, and pause the audio when
44560	50640	I add them, without cutting the audio at all. The only things I've cut out, with Ben's permission,
50640	56160	are where we had technical issues of no sound or no images. So if Ben wants to post this on his
56160	61520	channel without the fact-checks, he can do so seamlessly by simply cutting them out. Anyway,
61520	71920	here goes. Well listen, you go first, because you were the one who thought my video was
73600	81920	misrepresenting you, so I'm happy to listen to that. Alright, so I'd rather not hurl accusations
81920	87120	at you, what I'd rather do is sort of go through some of the things right now, and
88960	92160	you tell me where I'm going wrong, okay? Okay, sure.
95680	100160	And I'll start with the fact that where you had crossed off Ice Age and put Interglacial,
100800	105440	I kind of figured that all the stuff above that was what happened during the Interglacial. We're
105440	110080	in the Interglacial, and so the way I saw it is, you know, we're in the Ice Age for a long time,
110160	115360	there's glaciers forming at the poles, obviously, there's ice up there, and then there's ice also
115360	119840	at lower latitudes. Maybe not at what we would consider low latitude, but at least at mid
119840	127360	latitudes, latitudes that are lower. As I understood it, Earth was in an Ice Age and
127360	134480	had been in many Ice Ages where, unlike today where we see ice semi-permanently at the polar
134480	140720	regions or at some places of the poles permanently right now, there were glaciers at lower latitudes
140720	149440	as well. For example, in the Great Lakes region, and probably parts of Scandinavia, things like
149440	157120	that. And so what happens is it doesn't all just start to melt right away. What happens is the
157120	163360	glaciers at mid latitudes start to melt, but while that is happening, at the polar region,
164000	170800	there is much more accumulation of ice. There's a lot more, it's not like the whole planet starts
170800	176560	melting all at once. So we're in an Ice Age and that's how it is. And that 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 was
176560	183040	supposed to be the story of the Interglacial. And 5 was supposed to be a question mark as to how that
183040	191920	was actually going to happen. So as I saw it, as opposed to ice accumulating everywhere, the first
191920	197360	thing we notice in an interglacial is that the ice is accumulating only at the poles,
198080	208320	as opposed to everywhere. And that is what drops Earth's albedo. The fact that we went from having
208320	215120	ice everywhere to ice being accumulating at the poles. Now, because this is just apparently the
215120	220160	first video in this series that you've commented on, it is a bit like coming into Wednesday in
220160	226320	week 9 in a seminar class. And so we've been talking about the different phases of ice.
226320	231600	There's ice accumulating everywhere, there's ice accumulating at the poles, and then there's ice
231600	239120	melting everywhere. Those are basically the only 3 phases Earth has. And so as we come out of a
239120	244400	glacial period and we go into the interglacial, the story of that is we go from having ice
244400	249920	everywhere to ice accumulating at the poles only. When this happens, Earth's albedo drops.
250560	257120	The planet warms up even further. Eventually, that warmth overtakes the poles too.
258320	263120	CO2 is released, even more methane is released. While it's heating up, more water vapor is going
263120	270000	into the atmosphere. And yet, the question mark, number 5, always an ice age has followed. And that
270080	274800	seems to, we didn't attempt to give an answer to that. We just sort of said that is what has
274800	282640	happened. And correct me if I'm wrong, there was still CO2 and methane releases and water vapor
283600	288960	increases in the atmosphere during the previous interglacials, right? And something always throws
288960	294160	us back into an ice age. Okay. Right. Can I start with you there? Because I've been taking notes,
294160	299520	and there's a lot to get through on that. The first thing is, I did get the impression from
299600	306720	a lot of your subscribers that they saw some sort of hidden references behind all this,
306720	310880	that clearly, now that you tell me this is part of a series of things you've been doing,
312320	322080	that makes a lot more sense. Because taken on its own, this video did suggest that ice accumulate,
322080	327200	well, okay, I won't go into that. I'll show you the timeline a bit later. But I think what you're
327200	337120	not getting, let me ask you what you think, okay, what you don't get is why we go from an
337120	342560	interglacial. You can understand why we go from a glaciation into an interglacial. But what I
342560	348080	noticed was you said somehow we go from an interglacial back into a glaciation. That's
348080	354240	going from a warm interglacial like we have now back into what you call an ice age. Now,
354240	358880	you said somehow, which suggests that you don't think that there is any scientific explanation
358880	363600	for that. So first of all, let me just clarify, do you think there is a scientific explanation
363600	370080	for that? And do you know what that scientific explanation is? I have read it. And I think that
370080	377200	your video did a very good job explaining. You know, I sort of mentioned Milankovitch cycles
378000	381520	in a moment, and you just sort of did a much better job explaining what those are.
382160	393840	I have read a good deal about that. At the moment, you know, there's a big disconnect because
394400	399200	the same things that were happening in the atmosphere every previous time or the same
399200	404320	things that were happening in space with Earth every single time, those things are happening
404320	414560	again now. And so what is the disconnect? What is happening now that isn't just a faster version,
414560	420400	a more extreme version of what happened before? If you have a good answer to that.
420400	425040	Okay, I'll answer that. I'll answer that. The first thing I can tell you that's happening now
425040	431440	that never happened before is that we're getting carbon dioxide levels up to concentrations that
431440	435680	we have never seen in any interglacial before. So the first thing that's extraordinary about
435680	440320	what's happening now is the level of carbon dioxide. If you look back at interglacials in the
440320	446240	past, there was never this kind of CO2 concentration simply because there was never this kind of fossil
446240	452080	fuel burning. So we've had basically a 50% increase in the amount of CO2 in the atmosphere
452080	455520	because we've been burning fossil fuels. That's one thing that's different. But I want to bring
455520	461600	you back to one thing you said which was that what is happening now is what happened before
461600	468240	in the sense of, from what I understand of your hypothesis, your idea of how this works,
468240	475840	you think that ice melts at the poles, comes down to the lower latitudes, cuts off circulation,
475840	482720	ice forms at the lower latitudes, this causes us to go into an ice age or what geologists would
482720	495600	call a glaciation. That's not quite it. It's a larger process of things but the desalinization
495600	502560	is a big portion of it. I mean the the salinization level of the ocean could be as important as the
502560	512320	CO2 level in the troposphere. My question to you would be, do you believe that
512320	518080	everything we pump into the troposphere can just stay here at you know higher and higher densities
518080	522800	without bleeding more and more into the oceans and up into the stratosphere and in the ocean?
522800	528960	No no no because because the science now, look I can only follow what the researchers
528960	535040	have measured. 50% has stayed up there. 50% basically goes into the biosphere and the oceans
535040	539360	but can I, sorry, I don't want to stray away from this point because it's an important one.
539360	546480	I want to establish what it is you think that is happening now that also happened to bring an end
546480	551200	to the interglacials in the past. There's something you think that is happening now that also happened
551200	555840	that brought the past interglacials to a close. I'm trying to establish what that is. What I'm
555840	562000	saying is the only thing that is different is the is how much pollution humans have put into
562000	567680	the atmosphere. That's the only thing really that that's different. Just a quick fact check here so
567680	572800	you can see what we're talking about. The level of CO2 during most interglacials doesn't go much
572800	580160	above 280 parts per million. That's the blue line. In the last 200 years it's gone from 280 to over
580160	587520	400 parts per million in just 200 years. That's the red line. I mean if you look at the timing
588560	592560	you mean if you look at the timing of this interglacial this has been a fairly long
592560	599840	interglacial. Really? I mean compared to the last couple wouldn't you say?
601440	608240	Well the one that you pointed to when you did your second video rebutting mine you actually
608240	611920	clarified what you were talking about which was then clear that you were talking about coming out
611920	617360	of a glaciation. You were looking at termination 4. That was the example you gave of us coming out
617360	623040	of a glaciation. Well out of termination 4 the interglacial lasted about 50,000 60,000 years.
623760	630640	Now we're only about 11,000 into our interglacial so we have a long way to go yet.
630640	636400	Others are much shorter but you also get into glacials that are much longer. So I mean these
636400	643680	are not insignificant time periods. But again I don't want to stray away from the point that
643680	650480	I'm trying to get to. You said somehow we come out of this glacial this interglacial.
650480	656320	I'm trying to establish what it is you think scientists say because you're suggesting that
656320	662240	maybe scientists don't know. No I'm not suggesting that and it's not like every scientist in the
662240	668720	world says it's the exact same things and puts the exact same attribution on all of them.
668800	678320	You know I am not sure whether you fully understand what we were trying to do or what we
678320	689600	were trying to communicate there. But this is not always meant to be telling the exact line of what
689600	697120	peer-reviewed science is. Okay all right but let me just tell you what the science says and then
697120	703600	you can tell me why they're wrong. That would be the easiest way. According to the science
704240	709200	these cycles happen and they're very regular cycles. I mean they've got a periodicity of
709200	714800	about a hundred thousand years and they happen because of Milankovitch cycle. So we go into
715840	721920	a glaciation because the earth gets less sunlight because of the tilt and the wobble of the earth's
721920	728480	axis and its orbit. We get less sunlight and that little bit of less sunlight causes
729360	733040	the earth to cool a little bit which gives us more ice which gives us more albedo.
733600	740000	That causes the oceans to degas CO2 and carbon dioxide being a very powerful greenhouse gas
740560	746560	sorry to absorb CO2 because it's more soluble in colder water. That takes CO2 out of the
746560	750160	atmosphere and that continues the cooling. So there's a kind of a positive feedback
750160	755200	which accelerates this cooling. Now coming out of that is when we get the Milankovitch cycles
755200	765680	work in the opposite way where we get an increase in insulation and that causes less ice that means
765680	772080	less albedo. CO2 is degas from the oceans and CO2 is a powerful greenhouse gas so it warms the earth
772080	778000	even further and again we get a positive feedback. You suggested that that ought to cause runaway
778000	781680	warming but there's no reason why that should cause runaway warming. I did not suggest that
781680	789440	that would cause runaway warming. I put that at the at the end as a as a as like sort of like a
789440	795040	footnote or end note to the the very clear periodicity and one of your commenters hit me
795040	799840	hard and said hey look take a look during your supposed ice ages there's little spikes up here
799840	805280	and there and I had to explain that I wasn't suggesting that Milankovitch cycles were responsible
805280	811360	for every up and down on that chart but the very clear periodicity that I imagine a five or six
811360	816560	year old could say hey do you see the pattern of things going up and down spiking up and going
816560	821600	absolutely you know I said yeah what I was saying was hey if you wanted to know more about that
821600	827440	you could look into Milankovitch cycles that was all I said. Yeah and so there's no real mystery
827440	831760	then about why we're going in and out of glaciations or do you still think there's
831760	837520	no but but all right so so here's here's the point and here let me if I may run you through
837520	842000	weeks one through eight that you missed and you can maybe tell me if something's going wrong here
842880	850720	all right so sooner or later and I have actually read a couple different things about where we are
850720	856880	in the Milankovitch cycles but we are not exactly in the the favorable side if if you want a warmer
856880	862480	planet we are gonna you know basically from here on out we are going towards the colder period
863120	868160	now that's not something that's going to be playing in our lifetimes all right but it's
868160	873040	something that should be thought of when they're talking about you know hundreds thousands of years
873040	880800	ahead of time for right now here are the points that we have made that that makes us that make us
880800	886240	think that the planet is about to cool down and first and foremost is a combination of political
886240	893120	pressure continually worsening extreme weather and technological innovations are going to reduce
893120	899760	carbon emissions never underestimate human ingenuity or the power of disasters and propaganda
899760	906800	both good and bad propaganda there is almost no question in my mind that if you have any foresight
906800	913360	you can see the wild reduction of pollution of this planet it is not at all hard to see
914080	921920	if that occurs it's not like the desalinization of the oceans stops immediately those do increase
921920	928800	the freeze potential of the oceans in winter and they disrupt critical ocean currents they do help
928800	935920	stratify the ocean and partially incarcerate the sea floor methane releases now while that is
935920	941440	happening and it's not like if we stop polluting tomorrow the the warmth in the arctic that we've
942080	947360	been noticing anomalously is going to just suddenly disappear but we've learned that
947360	954320	the warm arctic is not the you know is another way to have a weaker polar vortex
954960	959600	early sudden stratospheric warming events and create more jet stream blocking that was what
959600	965520	i showed in in the actual video now what i brought back in during the discussion was the fact that we
965520	973680	had seen tons of articles about how low solar activity weakens the polar vortex increases early
973680	979040	sudden stratospheric warming events and creates more jet stream blocking and so what we will have
979040	984880	here is the sun entering a significant minimum the arctic will still be warm even if we stop
984880	991760	pollution and both of those things will force weaker polar vortex increases in sudden uh
991760	998160	stratospheric warmings and more jet stream blocking now specifically on the decreased solar
998800	1008480	you know this idea of 0.1 change over the solar cycle being the sun's influence in climate is
1008480	1015680	absolutely preposterous and if you saw the solar forcing for cmip6 when that does come out it will
1015680	1021360	no longer be restricted to that 0.1 the solar scientists have stood up and said that is
1021840	1027840	uncharacteristically preposterous because there's also x-ray radiation and their solar energetic
1027840	1034400	particles along with the indirect connection to galactic cosmic rays the ionization of the cloud
1034400	1040160	layer etc offering less energy while earth's albedo profile goes up due to cosmic rays
1041680	1045920	and so that's going to be happening more and more as we enter into that significant solar
1045920	1053680	minimum this century all these things should be happening this century um okay and you know this
1053680	1060560	is this is all fine but i mean uh i really i thought we were here to to talk about my
1061280	1066080	misrepresentations of what you'd said so i'd really like to get back onto that i i mean all
1066080	1072720	your theories are great and i i have no idea how much uh evidence you've got to support this because
1072720	1078240	you know what i would need to do is look at your sources and go through them um so could could we
1078240	1084320	just go back um would you mind if i i talk about you know what we were here to debate which was
1084960	1090160	my misrepresentations of your video and what you said in that video i'm sure that you said a lot of
1090160	1096240	things in other videos and i'm sure that this is the eighth in a series and that one through seven
1096240	1100720	talked about all sorts of other things but i really can't get into those now because i haven't
1100720	1107600	seen those videos on it so let's just deal with this video what i want to know is why why and i
1107600	1112240	don't know if you did this in comments or if there was some other video or on or you did this on
1112240	1121200	facebook or whatever because i i don't understand how this happened but i got literally over 800
1121920	1128400	comments within the span of 24 hours all saying virtually the same thing
1129360	1137520	that i didn't understand what those papers were saying and that i didn't have any basis
1138320	1144160	whatsoever in talking okay then then let's talk about that because i suspect the reason they said
1144160	1148400	that was because you didn't understand what the papers were saying now if you want to say
1148400	1152960	you did understand that's absolutely fine with me and and that's what i would like to talk about so
1153600	1163760	um what i've got um is um is is what you what you said uh about um about my video i mean i'm
1163760	1168640	i'm happy to talk about one of the papers if you want to if you want me to talk about which paper
1168640	1174400	did you think i misunderstood well here's the thing i wasn't i was not attempting to represent
1174400	1182000	the conclusions of the papers i was not attempting to do that i know but let's go with what you
1182000	1187680	actually said you you were you were doing let me just play you this this clip and this is from your
1187680	1193040	your video okay cold fresh water and various atmospheric connections send us spiraling into
1193040	1199200	an ice age thereafter just this month we learned that part of that process may include that extra
1199200	1205120	cold fresh water creating a stratification in the oceans that halts convection not to mention the
1205120	1217120	golf stream so um all that this was all i was meant to do and um this may help you understand
1217120	1227440	a lot um i put i put huge faith in observations i put much less faith in interpretations and
1227440	1233200	conclusions based on those and um frankly i have the track record to back that up
1233760	1239040	um this the only thing i cared about was we have been looking and waiting for the story that says
1239040	1244720	that there is an increased freshening of that water and the reason we've been waiting for that
1244720	1249440	is because we've been waiting for the Beaufort Gyre to release we've been waiting for that for
1250320	1253520	three times longer than we've ever supposed to have waited for that before
1254560	1260800	and it's not like people are just stationed up there taking measurements of the current all the
1260800	1266240	time it's not like you can put buoys okay so basically this paper you're you're saying this
1266240	1273680	paper doesn't support what you were saying about uh the um this this cold water being part of the
1273680	1282800	process that leads into an ice age you agree that it doesn't support that it it supports my overall
1282800	1289760	thesis that we could have a mini ice age like event this century and all we were looking for
1289760	1295920	was the increased freshening of the surface water all right so this is your theory this
1295920	1299920	is something you've come up with this has been what this whole thing is about the notion that
1299920	1307200	hey look we are we're about to see pollution take a dive while there are everywhere you look
1307200	1314560	signals that cold is coming or at least cold yeah yeah but no no it doesn't it doesn't sorry
1314800	1320800	this is where this is where i'm i'm i can actually begin to disagree with what you're saying here
1320800	1328560	because um you say cold is coming you're talking about global cold i'm talking as you know are you
1328560	1336480	not i'm talking about another mini ice age like event we had in the 1400s to 1600s but something
1336480	1341120	like that okay that's okay that was called the little ice age which is global cold you are
1341120	1348320	talking about global temperatures getting cooler rather than warmer yes okay right now that we've
1348320	1353520	established that you agree that these papers don't support that but this is basically just your idea
1353520	1358560	we've already established in fact i did play in my video the part where you do say that they don't
1358560	1363840	support it so i'm not trying to misrepresent what you said but you did say that we learned
1364800	1371200	this month and um in fact you were showing this paper uh suggesting that we learned from this
1371200	1375200	paper so all i'm saying is well we didn't learn it from this paper this is something that you
1375200	1380720	have come up with and you would agree uh all this paper does is show that there will there is
1381520	1388080	cold fresh water coming down from the arctic and it's hovering above the saline water the
1388080	1393520	more saline water of the overturning circulation and possibly cutting it off so that's basically
1393600	1398880	what the paper says the rest of it is is all your interpretation i think we're agreed on that are we
1399520	1406160	yes but that has never been something i so is this whole thing going to be about like you didn't
1406160	1412560	realize that i was giving my my hypothesis and my things about this and you don't think i have
1412560	1419760	the chops to do it should we just skip to where i no no no no not at all not at all i'm just trying
1419760	1426640	to establish um uh that one of the one of the things you said was that somehow i had misled
1426640	1434720	people uh in to saying that you were claiming that these papers uh somehow uh did not support
1434720	1440000	the warming or something like that i can play you the clip but but basically what i'm showing is
1440000	1446000	that uh there was a slight misrepresentation in that you did say that we're learning from these
1446000	1452160	papers that this is part of the process that leads into it i think that was a very i think
1452160	1457360	that was a kind way of saying it if you were just to walk into this seminar week nine in this video
1457360	1463840	the whole thing seems like of a wild misrepresentation i think okay well that's
1463840	1469920	fine so i didn't misread anything no but what you did you you would agree but what you did was
1469920	1475120	even you would agree that if you just watch this video and you haven't watched the entire series
1475120	1479200	of which most people when they watch youtube videos they watch a video because it's got an
1479200	1485040	interesting headline they read they watch it and they get kind of taken in by it now if they
1485040	1490800	haven't seen the previous seven they wouldn't know uh what this video is saying so when you say well
1490800	1494960	you know you're misrepresenting what i said actually i'm just taking exactly what you said
1494960	1500000	now that maybe that there were a lot of thoughts behind that that you didn't put out in the video
1500000	1503600	there were a lot of things that you'd said earlier that were not in this video that's fine
1504080	1508160	uh i'm just saying that this is what you were putting out in this video which a lot of people
1508160	1513680	would see without having seen the entire series i i strongly disagree the only reason why so many
1513680	1519520	people are going to see this is because of what you did i am not discoverable easily unless you
1519520	1525520	type my name in i am intentionally hard to discover on youtube no no i've seen your name
1525520	1530640	before yes you've seen my name before because it pops up on on a lot of your videos and we've
1530640	1535920	talked about the same kind of thing a lot of times but it's not like somebody could
1535920	1540320	go type in climate change and my name would ever come up in a million years
1542000	1547760	but even so i think i think we we all have a responsibility to represent if that is the case
1547760	1552160	you had i think you had a responsibility to send me an email and say hey what are you doing or at
1552160	1557920	least go and try to find some of my other videos on on the climate because what ended up happening
1557920	1564000	is a bunch of people hundreds of people didn't know what happened and they came and my god some
1564000	1572880	of your viewers were so horrendously vulgar listen i can't i'm sorry i i had a lot from yours as well
1572880	1578080	so i can't be responsible for what people post on your videos but and i'm sure you can't be
1578080	1585440	responsible for what people uh know but but the idea let's not get in but can we talk about the
1585440	1589920	science yes because i'm not getting into an argument about what i was talking somebody posted
1589920	1594240	something that you found offensive what i was talking about and what offended me was the notion
1594240	1601520	that this was portrayed to be something it wasn't this was portrayed to be then that's what that's
1601520	1606640	what this discussion is about then that's what this discussion is about so let's get to the bottom
1606640	1614160	of whether this this was fair enough or not um now you you did say um you need to go to the studies
1614160	1620560	on this right uh uh the um the study that you're talking about is this one by altman's you've read
1620560	1628080	this study have you yeah if you're going to ask me to remember specific lines out of it i i'm not
1628080	1633600	i'm not but you did obviously read the study um you know because you're quoting the study and you
1633600	1638800	did advise people to go and read the study rather than just the summary so i'm just establishing that
1638800	1646400	you actually did read that study yes sir okay um now it doesn't and and i think we can agree it
1646400	1651280	doesn't concur with your idea that uh this is going to lead into an ice age we've already
1651280	1657840	established that how about whether it concurs that the cold water coming south is likely to freeze is
1657840	1662560	there anything in the paper that suggests that i did not suggest that that is where that information
1662560	1668000	came from that was something that people already you did no no i didn't say that i was just asking
1668000	1673200	no nothing in this paper says that but as long as people realize i didn't say it did
1674320	1679760	i didn't say this paper said that no but does it does it contradict that though um
1681680	1687600	maybe i i don't remember uh exactly that's not really the reason i was reading this paper like
1687600	1694560	for example i didn't pay much attention to the methods section of this paper okay no i very
1694560	1700320	rarely do either but um what do you think um i mean do you disagree with the paper put it that
1700320	1706080	way is there anything in the paper that you disagree with i think they got you know i i do
1706080	1710720	remember the answer is yes but i don't remember what that was exactly at this time and frankly
1710720	1716880	the the majority of my problems with these papers is the fact that you know because of how many
1716880	1721840	papers come out in the climate realm even though we have known what solar forcing is going to be
1721840	1728720	for cmip6 for a year now um and even though there have been hundreds of papers that are going to be
1728720	1735040	included in the next update when it comes out there is nobody who's using anything but cmip5
1735040	1742640	for these studies and it this is by necessity you couldn't expect you know even these three people
1742640	1749040	and if they had 10 students working with them to go and figure out what the what all the new
1749040	1753360	variables would be in their model between the time they submitted the paper and it got published
1753360	1759120	bunch of those variables would change you know okay what was the conclusion of the paper dude
1759120	1762800	i know it's been a while since you read it but basically what was its conclusion
1765680	1775200	um man i i'm racking my brain here this uh was this the one that was talking about um
1775840	1780560	the accumulation versus uh the accumulated retention versus the release amount
1781440	1786240	the paper we're looking at is the one ben mentioned here and that he's citing it's the
1786240	1792160	paper from which ben said we learned that part of the process of glaciation may include extra cold
1792160	1797920	fresh water creating a stratification in the oceans the paper does say that fresh water will
1797920	1803840	be injected into the atlantic but it does not say that that is part of the process of glaciation
1803840	1808480	so we did not learn this from the paper if you want to check this i've cited the paper
1808480	1813840	in the video description this is the one that was talking about an increased uh risk well are you
1813840	1819120	seeing the the screenshot in front of you i'm seeing it but it's a little blurry in terms of the
1819120	1826000	words okay the headline of the paper is increased risk of a shutdown of ocean convection posed by
1826000	1831520	warm north atlantic summers okay um which pretty much says it all you know that that was the one
1831760	1838880	that um i just played on your clip that you suggested showed that this would stop the
1838880	1846720	overturning circulation of the uh atlantic and it would keep the cool fresh water on top and and the
1846720	1852560	saline water underneath stop the circulation now your your theory is that that would lead to
1852560	1860640	freezing of this um top layer of cold water not all it's not like it's going to freeze down off
1860640	1869920	the coast of north carolina man but as more ice enters the water and as it loses its saline
1869920	1877200	its saline profile we will see spikes in ice i mean but how did we get record high Antarctic
1877200	1884160	ice all right all right let's deal with that then if we're going to see spikes in ice you do you
1884160	1889680	know that the conclusion of the paper was the complete opposite i am aware of that the reason
1889680	1895600	but we have seen the opposite happen in both the north and the south over just the last decade
1895600	1902560	in 2013 and 2014 there was record high Antarctic ice and then we didn't have record high arctic
1902560	1908640	ice but we saw uh what they called a record recovery of the arctic just a couple years
1908640	1914160	ago i think you you you misunderstand me when i say that its conclusion is the complete opposite
1914160	1919120	i'm not saying it's the complete opposite of your your theory i mean that's that's something else
1919120	1926320	we're talking about specifics you say that the uh the water on top will freeze now in fact what
1926320	1932320	the paper concludes and the paper is is quite clear on on the quantity of heat coming out
1932320	1936480	have you got um can you see now the middle of the paper which i'm showing you with
1936480	1944240	two red boxes one left one left and one right right um they talk about um regressing on the
1944240	1948720	left-hand side regressing the results on both summer indices we find that the salinity anomaly
1948720	1955360	accounts for an energy surplus of around 2.8 times 10 to the 8th joules per square meter
1955360	1962400	after fresh erminia sea summers and around 4.8 times 10 to the uh power of 8 joules per square
1962400	1967280	meter after fresh labrador summers now we can go on and and look at their conclusions
1968080	1975200	and their conclusions actually say that the that the reason uh the bit because we've got this
1975200	1980240	this layer of fresh water on top the reason it's not sinking is not because it's too cold
1980240	1987840	but because it's too warm and if it got colder it would sink because of course uh colder colder
1987840	1993680	water does sink and then the circulation would would be okay the reason the circulation is not
1993680	1999440	working is because the water is too warm so in fact those figures which um i haven't heard you
1999440	2005520	disputing uh show that in fact this water is too warm it wouldn't freeze it would simply drop and
2005520	2011360	cause the circulation to continue um this is not just my interpretation of the paper and i i read
2011360	2017200	the paper uh new scientist says exactly the same thing um and this is a clip from new scientist
2017200	2022320	which i'm showing you now um the fresh water poses the threat to convection it has been
2023040	2031200	water it has to be cool um so i'm very aware of this conclusion but oh you are okay
2033280	2035200	i thought you didn't know what the conclusion was
2036560	2040560	well i mean i i remember it now but that would be the part i disagreed with
2042560	2049520	because why do you disagree with them because we have actually seen observations of the physical
2049600	2055760	world that show the exact opposite i want to know specifically sorry specifically what do
2055760	2060880	you disagree with do you disagree that cool water would sink no i don't the fresh water got colder
2060880	2068640	it would sink you disagree with that no what i am saying is this same excuse of oh the the you know
2068640	2077040	this is the same thing that they said caused the record high antarctic ice back in 2013 and 2014
2077040	2083040	when all those websites were using the record high antarctic ice to try to slam climate science
2083040	2087680	what was the proper answer yeah but but you're talking you're talking about this paper and
2087680	2092160	you're talking about the north atlantic so can we get back to what i'm saying is and the north
2092160	2098320	atlantic and this is the thing that you keep cutting me off you keep cutting me off man i i'm
2098320	2103920	just trying to get the full thought out and you keep cutting me off and it's okay your accent your
2103920	2109040	accent is so charming that it's like i i'm thrown off i don't know what to do about it
2109040	2117120	but so what i'm saying is the reason given for the record high arctic recovery when it happened
2117120	2124960	a couple years ago was that so much cold fresh water had melted off into it the explanation
2125680	2133760	for the record high antarctic ice in 2013 and 2014 was that cold fresh water had melted off
2136240	2142640	into the into the water cooled it off slightly it changed the salinity those were the i mean
2142640	2147760	i wasn't part of that battle back and forth but i saw one side of the debate yelling hey like look
2147760	2153120	at this we've got record high antarctic ice back then and like hey look we've got a record recovery
2153120	2158080	in the arctic and i saw the other side saying well you just put a bunch of cold fresh water
2158080	2164400	in there chilled it off and increased i'm sorry and and decreased the salinity what did you expect
2164400	2170080	was going to happen and here we have this other paper that it observes the same thing and then
2170080	2180320	uses and then uses a you know what is i suppose very good math um you know repeatable you know
2180320	2186880	math can be replicated to show that something is going to happen but we have seen this exact same
2186880	2194960	thing and the exact opposite happens on the planet this was the that that that water the
2194960	2202800	the freshening on top and the melting of the ice that was what was supposedly causing that
2203760	2209520	and it will this not have an effect on the gulf stream as well i mean i actually don't know as
2209520	2215120	much about its effect on the gulf stream and the keroshe current but i mean would it not disrupt
2215120	2221280	those as well eventually first of all let me apologize for interrupting you um you you're
2221280	2227680	right that that was rude and i'll tell you why i did it because i i felt when we're on a track
2227680	2232560	and we're on a subject um i had the experience as a journalist and i've interviewed a lot of
2232560	2238720	politicians and i'm not saying you're a politician but but people do tend to to get away to other
2238720	2244320	subjects and the antarctic and the arctic are completely different situations completely
2244320	2250800	different so you can't say well no i wouldn't say they're completely different situations it's it's
2250800	2256880	both when what i'm talking about the surface freeze it is about the temperature and the
2256880	2262320	salinity profile of the water which is affected by the melting ice that is not i mean it's not
2262320	2267520	like you've got different chemistries at work and you've got different laws of physics at work in
2267520	2273920	the north and south poles right okay but but there is there is a difference in in ocean
2273920	2279440	circulation there's a huge difference in the amount of warming and and sorry but but i think
2279440	2284480	let's focus on the thing that we're talking about because once you start saying yeah but in another
2284480	2288400	situation it's completely different yeah in another situation it is completely different
2288400	2293600	i think we can both agree on that there are reasons there are reasons why things happen
2293600	2302400	in antarctica for example it happened in the arctic too let's deal with the arctic then and
2302400	2308640	the north atlantic and the paper that is now the one that's under discussion what i'm interested
2308640	2313680	in knowing is that you disagree with the the paper and i'm what i'm trying to get at is
2313680	2319280	what is it you disagree with when they say that the fresh water on top is staying on top because
2319280	2325440	it's warmer because it has a heat content whereas if it cooled as we know from basic physics cool
2325440	2330880	water tends to sink and so you disagree with the conclusions of the paper and i'm trying to find
2330880	2337120	out why you think that cool water would not sink and restart the ocean circulation what is it that
2337120	2342160	you know that these researchers don't know because this is the exact same thing that happened
2342160	2346320	when the arctic had its record ice recovery
2348320	2353920	with respect it's not um the the arctic doesn't have the same overturning circulation
2355120	2361040	we are talking about the other the other thing is the arctic is a lot colder the ant sorry i
2361040	2366080	wasn't sorry i might have missed something you you say that again i'm sorry that was probably my
2366080	2371680	fault all right so yes okay i did include that thing about the about the antarctic
2371680	2378000	but during that same time they had what up north what they called a record recovery
2378000	2383440	of the arctic ice there was a spike back up and during that brief period and of course it's all
2383440	2388080	gone now we're at record low now but if you'll recall and i don't remember if it was exactly
2388080	2392800	at the time when antarctica was at record high or it was slightly after but there was that period
2392800	2400240	where there was the uh the record recovery from the low point in summer to where it was in winter
2400240	2408800	and it had a great winter and the explanation for that was more cold fresh water melted off
2408800	2415520	into the ocean so i emailed him after the discussion and asked him to cite the study that
2415520	2421120	said the explanation for that record recovery was more fresh water melted off into the ocean
2421920	2428080	his response it didn't come from a scientific study it was on a social media site ben doesn't
2428080	2434320	remember what year it was but he remembers there was a post from michael man and some guy from noah
2434320	2439600	whose name he can't remember he doesn't remember which ice recovery was being referred to but he
2439600	2445360	says it was in the last 10 years and it was a record recovery so that can only be the record
2445360	2453280	ice advance of 2012-2013 unfortunately ben didn't keep a copy so i have no idea what was actually
2453280	2460000	written in that post or what study it was based on if any so let's go to the actual study which
2460000	2466720	shows the scientific explanation they don't say the recovery was due to ice melting into the ocean
2466720	2472880	they say the opposite it was caused by a lack of melt a definitive study published in nature
2472880	2479360	geoscience concluded that the increase was driven by the retention of thick sea ice northwest of
2479360	2486000	greenland during 2013 which in turn was associated with a five percent drop in the number of days on
2486000	2491120	which melting occurred so we moved on to other issues which i'll have to put in part two of this
2491120	2495840	conversation when i get around to mixing it with the graphics i go on assignment in the middle of
2495840	2501520	april which is why i had to get this done quickly i've got another timely video to post this week
2501520	2506880	plus my discussion with academic agent another youtuber and i'm putting the final touches to
2506880	2512080	a regular video that i hope to post before i leave it's going to be unusually busy on
2512080	2515360	this channel for the next couple of weeks thanks for watching
