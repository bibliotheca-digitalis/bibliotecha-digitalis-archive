1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,680
the first half of the discussion I had with Ben Davidson, aka Suspicious Observers. This came out

2
00:00:05,680 --> 00:00:11,520
of his claims that I'd lied and deliberately misrepresented one of his videos, and his call

3
00:00:11,520 --> 00:00:18,000
for a live debate on my alleged misdeeds. Two days before we were due to talk, Ben told me it wasn't

4
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:24,080
going out live after all, and I had no time to get that organised from my side. So I asked Ben to send

5
00:00:24,080 --> 00:00:29,040
me the audio file, which he very kindly did, and I'd been matching it to the images I was showing

6
00:00:29,040 --> 00:00:34,240
him during our discussion. Since the discussion I've also fact-checked some of his claims that

7
00:00:34,240 --> 00:00:39,120
I couldn't check in the middle of the discussion, and also added a couple of graphics to illustrate

8
00:00:39,120 --> 00:00:44,560
what we're talking about. I make it very clear when these are added, and pause the audio when

9
00:00:44,560 --> 00:00:50,640
I add them, without cutting the audio at all. The only things I've cut out, with Ben's permission,

10
00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:56,160
are where we had technical issues of no sound or no images. So if Ben wants to post this on his

11
00:00:56,160 --> 00:01:01,520
channel without the fact-checks, he can do so seamlessly by simply cutting them out. Anyway,

12
00:01:01,520 --> 00:01:11,920
here goes. Well listen, you go first, because you were the one who thought my video was

13
00:01:13,600 --> 00:01:21,920
misrepresenting you, so I'm happy to listen to that. Alright, so I'd rather not hurl accusations

14
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:27,120
at you, what I'd rather do is sort of go through some of the things right now, and

15
00:01:28,960 --> 00:01:32,160
you tell me where I'm going wrong, okay? Okay, sure.

16
00:01:35,680 --> 00:01:40,160
And I'll start with the fact that where you had crossed off Ice Age and put Interglacial,

17
00:01:40,800 --> 00:01:45,440
I kind of figured that all the stuff above that was what happened during the Interglacial. We're

18
00:01:45,440 --> 00:01:50,080
in the Interglacial, and so the way I saw it is, you know, we're in the Ice Age for a long time,

19
00:01:50,160 --> 00:01:55,360
there's glaciers forming at the poles, obviously, there's ice up there, and then there's ice also

20
00:01:55,360 --> 00:01:59,840
at lower latitudes. Maybe not at what we would consider low latitude, but at least at mid

21
00:01:59,840 --> 00:02:07,360
latitudes, latitudes that are lower. As I understood it, Earth was in an Ice Age and

22
00:02:07,360 --> 00:02:14,480
had been in many Ice Ages where, unlike today where we see ice semi-permanently at the polar

23
00:02:14,480 --> 00:02:20,720
regions or at some places of the poles permanently right now, there were glaciers at lower latitudes

24
00:02:20,720 --> 00:02:29,440
as well. For example, in the Great Lakes region, and probably parts of Scandinavia, things like

25
00:02:29,440 --> 00:02:37,120
that. And so what happens is it doesn't all just start to melt right away. What happens is the

26
00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:43,360
glaciers at mid latitudes start to melt, but while that is happening, at the polar region,

27
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:50,800
there is much more accumulation of ice. There's a lot more, it's not like the whole planet starts

28
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:56,560
melting all at once. So we're in an Ice Age and that's how it is. And that 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 was

29
00:02:56,560 --> 00:03:03,040
supposed to be the story of the Interglacial. And 5 was supposed to be a question mark as to how that

30
00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:11,920
was actually going to happen. So as I saw it, as opposed to ice accumulating everywhere, the first

31
00:03:11,920 --> 00:03:17,360
thing we notice in an interglacial is that the ice is accumulating only at the poles,

32
00:03:18,080 --> 00:03:28,320
as opposed to everywhere. And that is what drops Earth's albedo. The fact that we went from having

33
00:03:28,320 --> 00:03:35,120
ice everywhere to ice being accumulating at the poles. Now, because this is just apparently the

34
00:03:35,120 --> 00:03:40,160
first video in this series that you've commented on, it is a bit like coming into Wednesday in

35
00:03:40,160 --> 00:03:46,320
week 9 in a seminar class. And so we've been talking about the different phases of ice.

36
00:03:46,320 --> 00:03:51,600
There's ice accumulating everywhere, there's ice accumulating at the poles, and then there's ice

37
00:03:51,600 --> 00:03:59,120
melting everywhere. Those are basically the only 3 phases Earth has. And so as we come out of a

38
00:03:59,120 --> 00:04:04,400
glacial period and we go into the interglacial, the story of that is we go from having ice

39
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:09,920
everywhere to ice accumulating at the poles only. When this happens, Earth's albedo drops.

40
00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:17,120
The planet warms up even further. Eventually, that warmth overtakes the poles too.

41
00:04:18,320 --> 00:04:23,120
CO2 is released, even more methane is released. While it's heating up, more water vapor is going

42
00:04:23,120 --> 00:04:30,000
into the atmosphere. And yet, the question mark, number 5, always an ice age has followed. And that

43
00:04:30,080 --> 00:04:34,800
seems to, we didn't attempt to give an answer to that. We just sort of said that is what has

44
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:42,640
happened. And correct me if I'm wrong, there was still CO2 and methane releases and water vapor

45
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:48,960
increases in the atmosphere during the previous interglacials, right? And something always throws

46
00:04:48,960 --> 00:04:54,160
us back into an ice age. Okay. Right. Can I start with you there? Because I've been taking notes,

47
00:04:54,160 --> 00:04:59,520
and there's a lot to get through on that. The first thing is, I did get the impression from

48
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:06,720
a lot of your subscribers that they saw some sort of hidden references behind all this,

49
00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:10,880
that clearly, now that you tell me this is part of a series of things you've been doing,

50
00:05:12,320 --> 00:05:22,080
that makes a lot more sense. Because taken on its own, this video did suggest that ice accumulate,

51
00:05:22,080 --> 00:05:27,200
well, okay, I won't go into that. I'll show you the timeline a bit later. But I think what you're

52
00:05:27,200 --> 00:05:37,120
not getting, let me ask you what you think, okay, what you don't get is why we go from an

53
00:05:37,120 --> 00:05:42,560
interglacial. You can understand why we go from a glaciation into an interglacial. But what I

54
00:05:42,560 --> 00:05:48,080
noticed was you said somehow we go from an interglacial back into a glaciation. That's

55
00:05:48,080 --> 00:05:54,240
going from a warm interglacial like we have now back into what you call an ice age. Now,

56
00:05:54,240 --> 00:05:58,880
you said somehow, which suggests that you don't think that there is any scientific explanation

57
00:05:58,880 --> 00:06:03,600
for that. So first of all, let me just clarify, do you think there is a scientific explanation

58
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:10,080
for that? And do you know what that scientific explanation is? I have read it. And I think that

59
00:06:10,080 --> 00:06:17,200
your video did a very good job explaining. You know, I sort of mentioned Milankovitch cycles

60
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:21,520
in a moment, and you just sort of did a much better job explaining what those are.

61
00:06:22,160 --> 00:06:33,840
I have read a good deal about that. At the moment, you know, there's a big disconnect because

62
00:06:34,400 --> 00:06:39,200
the same things that were happening in the atmosphere every previous time or the same

63
00:06:39,200 --> 00:06:44,320
things that were happening in space with Earth every single time, those things are happening

64
00:06:44,320 --> 00:06:54,560
again now. And so what is the disconnect? What is happening now that isn't just a faster version,

65
00:06:54,560 --> 00:07:00,400
a more extreme version of what happened before? If you have a good answer to that.

66
00:07:00,400 --> 00:07:05,040
Okay, I'll answer that. I'll answer that. The first thing I can tell you that's happening now

67
00:07:05,040 --> 00:07:11,440
that never happened before is that we're getting carbon dioxide levels up to concentrations that

68
00:07:11,440 --> 00:07:15,680
we have never seen in any interglacial before. So the first thing that's extraordinary about

69
00:07:15,680 --> 00:07:20,320
what's happening now is the level of carbon dioxide. If you look back at interglacials in the

70
00:07:20,320 --> 00:07:26,240
past, there was never this kind of CO2 concentration simply because there was never this kind of fossil

71
00:07:26,240 --> 00:07:32,080
fuel burning. So we've had basically a 50% increase in the amount of CO2 in the atmosphere

72
00:07:32,080 --> 00:07:35,520
because we've been burning fossil fuels. That's one thing that's different. But I want to bring

73
00:07:35,520 --> 00:07:41,600
you back to one thing you said which was that what is happening now is what happened before

74
00:07:41,600 --> 00:07:48,240
in the sense of, from what I understand of your hypothesis, your idea of how this works,

75
00:07:48,240 --> 00:07:55,840
you think that ice melts at the poles, comes down to the lower latitudes, cuts off circulation,

76
00:07:55,840 --> 00:08:02,720
ice forms at the lower latitudes, this causes us to go into an ice age or what geologists would

77
00:08:02,720 --> 00:08:15,600
call a glaciation. That's not quite it. It's a larger process of things but the desalinization

78
00:08:15,600 --> 00:08:22,560
is a big portion of it. I mean the the salinization level of the ocean could be as important as the

79
00:08:22,560 --> 00:08:32,320
CO2 level in the troposphere. My question to you would be, do you believe that

80
00:08:32,320 --> 00:08:38,080
everything we pump into the troposphere can just stay here at you know higher and higher densities

81
00:08:38,080 --> 00:08:42,800
without bleeding more and more into the oceans and up into the stratosphere and in the ocean?

82
00:08:42,800 --> 00:08:48,960
No no no because because the science now, look I can only follow what the researchers

83
00:08:48,960 --> 00:08:55,040
have measured. 50% has stayed up there. 50% basically goes into the biosphere and the oceans

84
00:08:55,040 --> 00:08:59,360
but can I, sorry, I don't want to stray away from this point because it's an important one.

85
00:08:59,360 --> 00:09:06,480
I want to establish what it is you think that is happening now that also happened to bring an end

86
00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:11,200
to the interglacials in the past. There's something you think that is happening now that also happened

87
00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:15,840
that brought the past interglacials to a close. I'm trying to establish what that is. What I'm

88
00:09:15,840 --> 00:09:22,000
saying is the only thing that is different is the is how much pollution humans have put into

89
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:27,680
the atmosphere. That's the only thing really that that's different. Just a quick fact check here so

90
00:09:27,680 --> 00:09:32,800
you can see what we're talking about. The level of CO2 during most interglacials doesn't go much

91
00:09:32,800 --> 00:09:40,160
above 280 parts per million. That's the blue line. In the last 200 years it's gone from 280 to over

92
00:09:40,160 --> 00:09:47,520
400 parts per million in just 200 years. That's the red line. I mean if you look at the timing

93
00:09:48,560 --> 00:09:52,560
you mean if you look at the timing of this interglacial this has been a fairly long

94
00:09:52,560 --> 00:09:59,840
interglacial. Really? I mean compared to the last couple wouldn't you say?

95
00:10:01,440 --> 00:10:08,240
Well the one that you pointed to when you did your second video rebutting mine you actually

96
00:10:08,240 --> 00:10:11,920
clarified what you were talking about which was then clear that you were talking about coming out

97
00:10:11,920 --> 00:10:17,360
of a glaciation. You were looking at termination 4. That was the example you gave of us coming out

98
00:10:17,360 --> 00:10:23,040
of a glaciation. Well out of termination 4 the interglacial lasted about 50,000 60,000 years.

99
00:10:23,760 --> 00:10:30,640
Now we're only about 11,000 into our interglacial so we have a long way to go yet.

100
00:10:30,640 --> 00:10:36,400
Others are much shorter but you also get into glacials that are much longer. So I mean these

101
00:10:36,400 --> 00:10:43,680
are not insignificant time periods. But again I don't want to stray away from the point that

102
00:10:43,680 --> 00:10:50,480
I'm trying to get to. You said somehow we come out of this glacial this interglacial.

103
00:10:50,480 --> 00:10:56,320
I'm trying to establish what it is you think scientists say because you're suggesting that

104
00:10:56,320 --> 00:11:02,240
maybe scientists don't know. No I'm not suggesting that and it's not like every scientist in the

105
00:11:02,240 --> 00:11:08,720
world says it's the exact same things and puts the exact same attribution on all of them.

106
00:11:08,800 --> 00:11:18,320
You know I am not sure whether you fully understand what we were trying to do or what we

107
00:11:18,320 --> 00:11:29,600
were trying to communicate there. But this is not always meant to be telling the exact line of what

108
00:11:29,600 --> 00:11:37,120
peer-reviewed science is. Okay all right but let me just tell you what the science says and then

109
00:11:37,120 --> 00:11:43,600
you can tell me why they're wrong. That would be the easiest way. According to the science

110
00:11:44,240 --> 00:11:49,200
these cycles happen and they're very regular cycles. I mean they've got a periodicity of

111
00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:54,800
about a hundred thousand years and they happen because of Milankovitch cycle. So we go into

112
00:11:55,840 --> 00:12:01,920
a glaciation because the earth gets less sunlight because of the tilt and the wobble of the earth's

113
00:12:01,920 --> 00:12:08,480
axis and its orbit. We get less sunlight and that little bit of less sunlight causes

114
00:12:09,360 --> 00:12:13,040
the earth to cool a little bit which gives us more ice which gives us more albedo.

115
00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:20,000
That causes the oceans to degas CO2 and carbon dioxide being a very powerful greenhouse gas

116
00:12:20,560 --> 00:12:26,560
sorry to absorb CO2 because it's more soluble in colder water. That takes CO2 out of the

117
00:12:26,560 --> 00:12:30,160
atmosphere and that continues the cooling. So there's a kind of a positive feedback

118
00:12:30,160 --> 00:12:35,200
which accelerates this cooling. Now coming out of that is when we get the Milankovitch cycles

119
00:12:35,200 --> 00:12:45,680
work in the opposite way where we get an increase in insulation and that causes less ice that means

120
00:12:45,680 --> 00:12:52,080
less albedo. CO2 is degas from the oceans and CO2 is a powerful greenhouse gas so it warms the earth

121
00:12:52,080 --> 00:12:58,000
even further and again we get a positive feedback. You suggested that that ought to cause runaway

122
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:01,680
warming but there's no reason why that should cause runaway warming. I did not suggest that

123
00:13:01,680 --> 00:13:09,440
that would cause runaway warming. I put that at the at the end as a as a as like sort of like a

124
00:13:09,440 --> 00:13:15,040
footnote or end note to the the very clear periodicity and one of your commenters hit me

125
00:13:15,040 --> 00:13:19,840
hard and said hey look take a look during your supposed ice ages there's little spikes up here

126
00:13:19,840 --> 00:13:25,280
and there and I had to explain that I wasn't suggesting that Milankovitch cycles were responsible

127
00:13:25,280 --> 00:13:31,360
for every up and down on that chart but the very clear periodicity that I imagine a five or six

128
00:13:31,360 --> 00:13:36,560
year old could say hey do you see the pattern of things going up and down spiking up and going

129
00:13:36,560 --> 00:13:41,600
absolutely you know I said yeah what I was saying was hey if you wanted to know more about that

130
00:13:41,600 --> 00:13:47,440
you could look into Milankovitch cycles that was all I said. Yeah and so there's no real mystery

131
00:13:47,440 --> 00:13:51,760
then about why we're going in and out of glaciations or do you still think there's

132
00:13:51,760 --> 00:13:57,520
no but but all right so so here's here's the point and here let me if I may run you through

133
00:13:57,520 --> 00:14:02,000
weeks one through eight that you missed and you can maybe tell me if something's going wrong here

134
00:14:02,880 --> 00:14:10,720
all right so sooner or later and I have actually read a couple different things about where we are

135
00:14:10,720 --> 00:14:16,880
in the Milankovitch cycles but we are not exactly in the the favorable side if if you want a warmer

136
00:14:16,880 --> 00:14:22,480
planet we are gonna you know basically from here on out we are going towards the colder period

137
00:14:23,120 --> 00:14:28,160
now that's not something that's going to be playing in our lifetimes all right but it's

138
00:14:28,160 --> 00:14:33,040
something that should be thought of when they're talking about you know hundreds thousands of years

139
00:14:33,040 --> 00:14:40,800
ahead of time for right now here are the points that we have made that that makes us that make us

140
00:14:40,800 --> 00:14:46,240
think that the planet is about to cool down and first and foremost is a combination of political

141
00:14:46,240 --> 00:14:53,120
pressure continually worsening extreme weather and technological innovations are going to reduce

142
00:14:53,120 --> 00:14:59,760
carbon emissions never underestimate human ingenuity or the power of disasters and propaganda

143
00:14:59,760 --> 00:15:06,800
both good and bad propaganda there is almost no question in my mind that if you have any foresight

144
00:15:06,800 --> 00:15:13,360
you can see the wild reduction of pollution of this planet it is not at all hard to see

145
00:15:14,080 --> 00:15:21,920
if that occurs it's not like the desalinization of the oceans stops immediately those do increase

146
00:15:21,920 --> 00:15:28,800
the freeze potential of the oceans in winter and they disrupt critical ocean currents they do help

147
00:15:28,800 --> 00:15:35,920
stratify the ocean and partially incarcerate the sea floor methane releases now while that is

148
00:15:35,920 --> 00:15:41,440
happening and it's not like if we stop polluting tomorrow the the warmth in the arctic that we've

149
00:15:42,080 --> 00:15:47,360
been noticing anomalously is going to just suddenly disappear but we've learned that

150
00:15:47,360 --> 00:15:54,320
the warm arctic is not the you know is another way to have a weaker polar vortex

151
00:15:54,960 --> 00:15:59,600
early sudden stratospheric warming events and create more jet stream blocking that was what

152
00:15:59,600 --> 00:16:05,520
i showed in in the actual video now what i brought back in during the discussion was the fact that we

153
00:16:05,520 --> 00:16:13,680
had seen tons of articles about how low solar activity weakens the polar vortex increases early

154
00:16:13,680 --> 00:16:19,040
sudden stratospheric warming events and creates more jet stream blocking and so what we will have

155
00:16:19,040 --> 00:16:24,880
here is the sun entering a significant minimum the arctic will still be warm even if we stop

156
00:16:24,880 --> 00:16:31,760
pollution and both of those things will force weaker polar vortex increases in sudden uh

157
00:16:31,760 --> 00:16:38,160
stratospheric warmings and more jet stream blocking now specifically on the decreased solar

158
00:16:38,800 --> 00:16:48,480
you know this idea of 0.1 change over the solar cycle being the sun's influence in climate is

159
00:16:48,480 --> 00:16:55,680
absolutely preposterous and if you saw the solar forcing for cmip6 when that does come out it will

160
00:16:55,680 --> 00:17:01,360
no longer be restricted to that 0.1 the solar scientists have stood up and said that is

161
00:17:01,840 --> 00:17:07,840
uncharacteristically preposterous because there's also x-ray radiation and their solar energetic

162
00:17:07,840 --> 00:17:14,400
particles along with the indirect connection to galactic cosmic rays the ionization of the cloud

163
00:17:14,400 --> 00:17:20,160
layer etc offering less energy while earth's albedo profile goes up due to cosmic rays

164
00:17:21,680 --> 00:17:25,920
and so that's going to be happening more and more as we enter into that significant solar

165
00:17:25,920 --> 00:17:33,680
minimum this century all these things should be happening this century um okay and you know this

166
00:17:33,680 --> 00:17:40,560
is this is all fine but i mean uh i really i thought we were here to to talk about my

167
00:17:41,280 --> 00:17:46,080
misrepresentations of what you'd said so i'd really like to get back onto that i i mean all

168
00:17:46,080 --> 00:17:52,720
your theories are great and i i have no idea how much uh evidence you've got to support this because

169
00:17:52,720 --> 00:17:58,240
you know what i would need to do is look at your sources and go through them um so could could we

170
00:17:58,240 --> 00:18:04,320
just go back um would you mind if i i talk about you know what we were here to debate which was

171
00:18:04,960 --> 00:18:10,160
my misrepresentations of your video and what you said in that video i'm sure that you said a lot of

172
00:18:10,160 --> 00:18:16,240
things in other videos and i'm sure that this is the eighth in a series and that one through seven

173
00:18:16,240 --> 00:18:20,720
talked about all sorts of other things but i really can't get into those now because i haven't

174
00:18:20,720 --> 00:18:27,600
seen those videos on it so let's just deal with this video what i want to know is why why and i

175
00:18:27,600 --> 00:18:32,240
don't know if you did this in comments or if there was some other video or on or you did this on

176
00:18:32,240 --> 00:18:41,200
facebook or whatever because i i don't understand how this happened but i got literally over 800

177
00:18:41,920 --> 00:18:48,400
comments within the span of 24 hours all saying virtually the same thing

178
00:18:49,360 --> 00:18:57,520
that i didn't understand what those papers were saying and that i didn't have any basis

179
00:18:58,320 --> 00:19:04,160
whatsoever in talking okay then then let's talk about that because i suspect the reason they said

180
00:19:04,160 --> 00:19:08,400
that was because you didn't understand what the papers were saying now if you want to say

181
00:19:08,400 --> 00:19:12,960
you did understand that's absolutely fine with me and and that's what i would like to talk about so

182
00:19:13,600 --> 00:19:23,760
um what i've got um is um is is what you what you said uh about um about my video i mean i'm

183
00:19:23,760 --> 00:19:28,640
i'm happy to talk about one of the papers if you want to if you want me to talk about which paper

184
00:19:28,640 --> 00:19:34,400
did you think i misunderstood well here's the thing i wasn't i was not attempting to represent

185
00:19:34,400 --> 00:19:42,000
the conclusions of the papers i was not attempting to do that i know but let's go with what you

186
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:47,680
actually said you you were you were doing let me just play you this this clip and this is from your

187
00:19:47,680 --> 00:19:53,040
your video okay cold fresh water and various atmospheric connections send us spiraling into

188
00:19:53,040 --> 00:19:59,200
an ice age thereafter just this month we learned that part of that process may include that extra

189
00:19:59,200 --> 00:20:05,120
cold fresh water creating a stratification in the oceans that halts convection not to mention the

190
00:20:05,120 --> 00:20:17,120
golf stream so um all that this was all i was meant to do and um this may help you understand

191
00:20:17,120 --> 00:20:27,440
a lot um i put i put huge faith in observations i put much less faith in interpretations and

192
00:20:27,440 --> 00:20:33,200
conclusions based on those and um frankly i have the track record to back that up

193
00:20:33,760 --> 00:20:39,040
um this the only thing i cared about was we have been looking and waiting for the story that says

194
00:20:39,040 --> 00:20:44,720
that there is an increased freshening of that water and the reason we've been waiting for that

195
00:20:44,720 --> 00:20:49,440
is because we've been waiting for the Beaufort Gyre to release we've been waiting for that for

196
00:20:50,320 --> 00:20:53,520
three times longer than we've ever supposed to have waited for that before

197
00:20:54,560 --> 00:21:00,800
and it's not like people are just stationed up there taking measurements of the current all the

198
00:21:00,800 --> 00:21:06,240
time it's not like you can put buoys okay so basically this paper you're you're saying this

199
00:21:06,240 --> 00:21:13,680
paper doesn't support what you were saying about uh the um this this cold water being part of the

200
00:21:13,680 --> 00:21:22,800
process that leads into an ice age you agree that it doesn't support that it it supports my overall

201
00:21:22,800 --> 00:21:29,760
thesis that we could have a mini ice age like event this century and all we were looking for

202
00:21:29,760 --> 00:21:35,920
was the increased freshening of the surface water all right so this is your theory this

203
00:21:35,920 --> 00:21:39,920
is something you've come up with this has been what this whole thing is about the notion that

204
00:21:39,920 --> 00:21:47,200
hey look we are we're about to see pollution take a dive while there are everywhere you look

205
00:21:47,200 --> 00:21:54,560
signals that cold is coming or at least cold yeah yeah but no no it doesn't it doesn't sorry

206
00:21:54,800 --> 00:22:00,800
this is where this is where i'm i'm i can actually begin to disagree with what you're saying here

207
00:22:00,800 --> 00:22:08,560
because um you say cold is coming you're talking about global cold i'm talking as you know are you

208
00:22:08,560 --> 00:22:16,480
not i'm talking about another mini ice age like event we had in the 1400s to 1600s but something

209
00:22:16,480 --> 00:22:21,120
like that okay that's okay that was called the little ice age which is global cold you are

210
00:22:21,120 --> 00:22:28,320
talking about global temperatures getting cooler rather than warmer yes okay right now that we've

211
00:22:28,320 --> 00:22:33,520
established that you agree that these papers don't support that but this is basically just your idea

212
00:22:33,520 --> 00:22:38,560
we've already established in fact i did play in my video the part where you do say that they don't

213
00:22:38,560 --> 00:22:43,840
support it so i'm not trying to misrepresent what you said but you did say that we learned

214
00:22:44,800 --> 00:22:51,200
this month and um in fact you were showing this paper uh suggesting that we learned from this

215
00:22:51,200 --> 00:22:55,200
paper so all i'm saying is well we didn't learn it from this paper this is something that you

216
00:22:55,200 --> 00:23:00,720
have come up with and you would agree uh all this paper does is show that there will there is

217
00:23:01,520 --> 00:23:08,080
cold fresh water coming down from the arctic and it's hovering above the saline water the

218
00:23:08,080 --> 00:23:13,520
more saline water of the overturning circulation and possibly cutting it off so that's basically

219
00:23:13,600 --> 00:23:18,880
what the paper says the rest of it is is all your interpretation i think we're agreed on that are we

220
00:23:19,520 --> 00:23:26,160
yes but that has never been something i so is this whole thing going to be about like you didn't

221
00:23:26,160 --> 00:23:32,560
realize that i was giving my my hypothesis and my things about this and you don't think i have

222
00:23:32,560 --> 00:23:39,760
the chops to do it should we just skip to where i no no no no not at all not at all i'm just trying

223
00:23:39,760 --> 00:23:46,640
to establish um uh that one of the one of the things you said was that somehow i had misled

224
00:23:46,640 --> 00:23:54,720
people uh in to saying that you were claiming that these papers uh somehow uh did not support

225
00:23:54,720 --> 00:24:00,000
the warming or something like that i can play you the clip but but basically what i'm showing is

226
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:06,000
that uh there was a slight misrepresentation in that you did say that we're learning from these

227
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:12,160
papers that this is part of the process that leads into it i think that was a very i think

228
00:24:12,160 --> 00:24:17,360
that was a kind way of saying it if you were just to walk into this seminar week nine in this video

229
00:24:17,360 --> 00:24:23,840
the whole thing seems like of a wild misrepresentation i think okay well that's

230
00:24:23,840 --> 00:24:29,920
fine so i didn't misread anything no but what you did you you would agree but what you did was

231
00:24:29,920 --> 00:24:35,120
even you would agree that if you just watch this video and you haven't watched the entire series

232
00:24:35,120 --> 00:24:39,200
of which most people when they watch youtube videos they watch a video because it's got an

233
00:24:39,200 --> 00:24:45,040
interesting headline they read they watch it and they get kind of taken in by it now if they

234
00:24:45,040 --> 00:24:50,800
haven't seen the previous seven they wouldn't know uh what this video is saying so when you say well

235
00:24:50,800 --> 00:24:54,960
you know you're misrepresenting what i said actually i'm just taking exactly what you said

236
00:24:54,960 --> 00:25:00,000
now that maybe that there were a lot of thoughts behind that that you didn't put out in the video

237
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:03,600
there were a lot of things that you'd said earlier that were not in this video that's fine

238
00:25:04,080 --> 00:25:08,160
uh i'm just saying that this is what you were putting out in this video which a lot of people

239
00:25:08,160 --> 00:25:13,680
would see without having seen the entire series i i strongly disagree the only reason why so many

240
00:25:13,680 --> 00:25:19,520
people are going to see this is because of what you did i am not discoverable easily unless you

241
00:25:19,520 --> 00:25:25,520
type my name in i am intentionally hard to discover on youtube no no i've seen your name

242
00:25:25,520 --> 00:25:30,640
before yes you've seen my name before because it pops up on on a lot of your videos and we've

243
00:25:30,640 --> 00:25:35,920
talked about the same kind of thing a lot of times but it's not like somebody could

244
00:25:35,920 --> 00:25:40,320
go type in climate change and my name would ever come up in a million years

245
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:47,760
but even so i think i think we we all have a responsibility to represent if that is the case

246
00:25:47,760 --> 00:25:52,160
you had i think you had a responsibility to send me an email and say hey what are you doing or at

247
00:25:52,160 --> 00:25:57,920
least go and try to find some of my other videos on on the climate because what ended up happening

248
00:25:57,920 --> 00:26:04,000
is a bunch of people hundreds of people didn't know what happened and they came and my god some

249
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:12,880
of your viewers were so horrendously vulgar listen i can't i'm sorry i i had a lot from yours as well

250
00:26:12,880 --> 00:26:18,080
so i can't be responsible for what people post on your videos but and i'm sure you can't be

251
00:26:18,080 --> 00:26:25,440
responsible for what people uh know but but the idea let's not get in but can we talk about the

252
00:26:25,440 --> 00:26:29,920
science yes because i'm not getting into an argument about what i was talking somebody posted

253
00:26:29,920 --> 00:26:34,240
something that you found offensive what i was talking about and what offended me was the notion

254
00:26:34,240 --> 00:26:41,520
that this was portrayed to be something it wasn't this was portrayed to be then that's what that's

255
00:26:41,520 --> 00:26:46,640
what this discussion is about then that's what this discussion is about so let's get to the bottom

256
00:26:46,640 --> 00:26:54,160
of whether this this was fair enough or not um now you you did say um you need to go to the studies

257
00:26:54,160 --> 00:27:00,560
on this right uh uh the um the study that you're talking about is this one by altman's you've read

258
00:27:00,560 --> 00:27:08,080
this study have you yeah if you're going to ask me to remember specific lines out of it i i'm not

259
00:27:08,080 --> 00:27:13,600
i'm not but you did obviously read the study um you know because you're quoting the study and you

260
00:27:13,600 --> 00:27:18,800
did advise people to go and read the study rather than just the summary so i'm just establishing that

261
00:27:18,800 --> 00:27:26,400
you actually did read that study yes sir okay um now it doesn't and and i think we can agree it

262
00:27:26,400 --> 00:27:31,280
doesn't concur with your idea that uh this is going to lead into an ice age we've already

263
00:27:31,280 --> 00:27:37,840
established that how about whether it concurs that the cold water coming south is likely to freeze is

264
00:27:37,840 --> 00:27:42,560
there anything in the paper that suggests that i did not suggest that that is where that information

265
00:27:42,560 --> 00:27:48,000
came from that was something that people already you did no no i didn't say that i was just asking

266
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:53,200
no nothing in this paper says that but as long as people realize i didn't say it did

267
00:27:54,320 --> 00:27:59,760
i didn't say this paper said that no but does it does it contradict that though um

268
00:28:01,680 --> 00:28:07,600
maybe i i don't remember uh exactly that's not really the reason i was reading this paper like

269
00:28:07,600 --> 00:28:14,560
for example i didn't pay much attention to the methods section of this paper okay no i very

270
00:28:14,560 --> 00:28:20,320
rarely do either but um what do you think um i mean do you disagree with the paper put it that

271
00:28:20,320 --> 00:28:26,080
way is there anything in the paper that you disagree with i think they got you know i i do

272
00:28:26,080 --> 00:28:30,720
remember the answer is yes but i don't remember what that was exactly at this time and frankly

273
00:28:30,720 --> 00:28:36,880
the the majority of my problems with these papers is the fact that you know because of how many

274
00:28:36,880 --> 00:28:41,840
papers come out in the climate realm even though we have known what solar forcing is going to be

275
00:28:41,840 --> 00:28:48,720
for cmip6 for a year now um and even though there have been hundreds of papers that are going to be

276
00:28:48,720 --> 00:28:55,040
included in the next update when it comes out there is nobody who's using anything but cmip5

277
00:28:55,040 --> 00:29:02,640
for these studies and it this is by necessity you couldn't expect you know even these three people

278
00:29:02,640 --> 00:29:09,040
and if they had 10 students working with them to go and figure out what the what all the new

279
00:29:09,040 --> 00:29:13,360
variables would be in their model between the time they submitted the paper and it got published

280
00:29:13,360 --> 00:29:19,120
bunch of those variables would change you know okay what was the conclusion of the paper dude

281
00:29:19,120 --> 00:29:22,800
i know it's been a while since you read it but basically what was its conclusion

282
00:29:25,680 --> 00:29:35,200
um man i i'm racking my brain here this uh was this the one that was talking about um

283
00:29:35,840 --> 00:29:40,560
the accumulation versus uh the accumulated retention versus the release amount

284
00:29:41,440 --> 00:29:46,240
the paper we're looking at is the one ben mentioned here and that he's citing it's the

285
00:29:46,240 --> 00:29:52,160
paper from which ben said we learned that part of the process of glaciation may include extra cold

286
00:29:52,160 --> 00:29:57,920
fresh water creating a stratification in the oceans the paper does say that fresh water will

287
00:29:57,920 --> 00:30:03,840
be injected into the atlantic but it does not say that that is part of the process of glaciation

288
00:30:03,840 --> 00:30:08,480
so we did not learn this from the paper if you want to check this i've cited the paper

289
00:30:08,480 --> 00:30:13,840
in the video description this is the one that was talking about an increased uh risk well are you

290
00:30:13,840 --> 00:30:19,120
seeing the the screenshot in front of you i'm seeing it but it's a little blurry in terms of the

291
00:30:19,120 --> 00:30:26,000
words okay the headline of the paper is increased risk of a shutdown of ocean convection posed by

292
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:31,520
warm north atlantic summers okay um which pretty much says it all you know that that was the one

293
00:30:31,760 --> 00:30:38,880
that um i just played on your clip that you suggested showed that this would stop the

294
00:30:38,880 --> 00:30:46,720
overturning circulation of the uh atlantic and it would keep the cool fresh water on top and and the

295
00:30:46,720 --> 00:30:52,560
saline water underneath stop the circulation now your your theory is that that would lead to

296
00:30:52,560 --> 00:31:00,640
freezing of this um top layer of cold water not all it's not like it's going to freeze down off

297
00:31:00,640 --> 00:31:09,920
the coast of north carolina man but as more ice enters the water and as it loses its saline

298
00:31:09,920 --> 00:31:17,200
its saline profile we will see spikes in ice i mean but how did we get record high Antarctic

299
00:31:17,200 --> 00:31:24,160
ice all right all right let's deal with that then if we're going to see spikes in ice you do you

300
00:31:24,160 --> 00:31:29,680
know that the conclusion of the paper was the complete opposite i am aware of that the reason

301
00:31:29,680 --> 00:31:35,600
but we have seen the opposite happen in both the north and the south over just the last decade

302
00:31:35,600 --> 00:31:42,560
in 2013 and 2014 there was record high Antarctic ice and then we didn't have record high arctic

303
00:31:42,560 --> 00:31:48,640
ice but we saw uh what they called a record recovery of the arctic just a couple years

304
00:31:48,640 --> 00:31:54,160
ago i think you you you misunderstand me when i say that its conclusion is the complete opposite

305
00:31:54,160 --> 00:31:59,120
i'm not saying it's the complete opposite of your your theory i mean that's that's something else

306
00:31:59,120 --> 00:32:06,320
we're talking about specifics you say that the uh the water on top will freeze now in fact what

307
00:32:06,320 --> 00:32:12,320
the paper concludes and the paper is is quite clear on on the quantity of heat coming out

308
00:32:12,320 --> 00:32:16,480
have you got um can you see now the middle of the paper which i'm showing you with

309
00:32:16,480 --> 00:32:24,240
two red boxes one left one left and one right right um they talk about um regressing on the

310
00:32:24,240 --> 00:32:28,720
left-hand side regressing the results on both summer indices we find that the salinity anomaly

311
00:32:28,720 --> 00:32:35,360
accounts for an energy surplus of around 2.8 times 10 to the 8th joules per square meter

312
00:32:35,360 --> 00:32:42,400
after fresh erminia sea summers and around 4.8 times 10 to the uh power of 8 joules per square

313
00:32:42,400 --> 00:32:47,280
meter after fresh labrador summers now we can go on and and look at their conclusions

314
00:32:48,080 --> 00:32:55,200
and their conclusions actually say that the that the reason uh the bit because we've got this

315
00:32:55,200 --> 00:33:00,240
this layer of fresh water on top the reason it's not sinking is not because it's too cold

316
00:33:00,240 --> 00:33:07,840
but because it's too warm and if it got colder it would sink because of course uh colder colder

317
00:33:07,840 --> 00:33:13,680
water does sink and then the circulation would would be okay the reason the circulation is not

318
00:33:13,680 --> 00:33:19,440
working is because the water is too warm so in fact those figures which um i haven't heard you

319
00:33:19,440 --> 00:33:25,520
disputing uh show that in fact this water is too warm it wouldn't freeze it would simply drop and

320
00:33:25,520 --> 00:33:31,360
cause the circulation to continue um this is not just my interpretation of the paper and i i read

321
00:33:31,360 --> 00:33:37,200
the paper uh new scientist says exactly the same thing um and this is a clip from new scientist

322
00:33:37,200 --> 00:33:42,320
which i'm showing you now um the fresh water poses the threat to convection it has been

323
00:33:43,040 --> 00:33:51,200
water it has to be cool um so i'm very aware of this conclusion but oh you are okay

324
00:33:53,280 --> 00:33:55,200
i thought you didn't know what the conclusion was

325
00:33:56,560 --> 00:34:00,560
well i mean i i remember it now but that would be the part i disagreed with

326
00:34:02,560 --> 00:34:09,520
because why do you disagree with them because we have actually seen observations of the physical

327
00:34:09,600 --> 00:34:15,760
world that show the exact opposite i want to know specifically sorry specifically what do

328
00:34:15,760 --> 00:34:20,880
you disagree with do you disagree that cool water would sink no i don't the fresh water got colder

329
00:34:20,880 --> 00:34:28,640
it would sink you disagree with that no what i am saying is this same excuse of oh the the you know

330
00:34:28,640 --> 00:34:37,040
this is the same thing that they said caused the record high antarctic ice back in 2013 and 2014

331
00:34:37,040 --> 00:34:43,040
when all those websites were using the record high antarctic ice to try to slam climate science

332
00:34:43,040 --> 00:34:47,680
what was the proper answer yeah but but you're talking you're talking about this paper and

333
00:34:47,680 --> 00:34:52,160
you're talking about the north atlantic so can we get back to what i'm saying is and the north

334
00:34:52,160 --> 00:34:58,320
atlantic and this is the thing that you keep cutting me off you keep cutting me off man i i'm

335
00:34:58,320 --> 00:35:03,920
just trying to get the full thought out and you keep cutting me off and it's okay your accent your

336
00:35:03,920 --> 00:35:09,040
accent is so charming that it's like i i'm thrown off i don't know what to do about it

337
00:35:09,040 --> 00:35:17,120
but so what i'm saying is the reason given for the record high arctic recovery when it happened

338
00:35:17,120 --> 00:35:24,960
a couple years ago was that so much cold fresh water had melted off into it the explanation

339
00:35:25,680 --> 00:35:33,760
for the record high antarctic ice in 2013 and 2014 was that cold fresh water had melted off

340
00:35:36,240 --> 00:35:42,640
into the into the water cooled it off slightly it changed the salinity those were the i mean

341
00:35:42,640 --> 00:35:47,760
i wasn't part of that battle back and forth but i saw one side of the debate yelling hey like look

342
00:35:47,760 --> 00:35:53,120
at this we've got record high antarctic ice back then and like hey look we've got a record recovery

343
00:35:53,120 --> 00:35:58,080
in the arctic and i saw the other side saying well you just put a bunch of cold fresh water

344
00:35:58,080 --> 00:36:04,400
in there chilled it off and increased i'm sorry and and decreased the salinity what did you expect

345
00:36:04,400 --> 00:36:10,080
was going to happen and here we have this other paper that it observes the same thing and then

346
00:36:10,080 --> 00:36:20,320
uses and then uses a you know what is i suppose very good math um you know repeatable you know

347
00:36:20,320 --> 00:36:26,880
math can be replicated to show that something is going to happen but we have seen this exact same

348
00:36:26,880 --> 00:36:34,960
thing and the exact opposite happens on the planet this was the that that that water the

349
00:36:34,960 --> 00:36:42,800
the freshening on top and the melting of the ice that was what was supposedly causing that

350
00:36:43,760 --> 00:36:49,520
and it will this not have an effect on the gulf stream as well i mean i actually don't know as

351
00:36:49,520 --> 00:36:55,120
much about its effect on the gulf stream and the keroshe current but i mean would it not disrupt

352
00:36:55,120 --> 00:37:01,280
those as well eventually first of all let me apologize for interrupting you um you you're

353
00:37:01,280 --> 00:37:07,680
right that that was rude and i'll tell you why i did it because i i felt when we're on a track

354
00:37:07,680 --> 00:37:12,560
and we're on a subject um i had the experience as a journalist and i've interviewed a lot of

355
00:37:12,560 --> 00:37:18,720
politicians and i'm not saying you're a politician but but people do tend to to get away to other

356
00:37:18,720 --> 00:37:24,320
subjects and the antarctic and the arctic are completely different situations completely

357
00:37:24,320 --> 00:37:30,800
different so you can't say well no i wouldn't say they're completely different situations it's it's

358
00:37:30,800 --> 00:37:36,880
both when what i'm talking about the surface freeze it is about the temperature and the

359
00:37:36,880 --> 00:37:42,320
salinity profile of the water which is affected by the melting ice that is not i mean it's not

360
00:37:42,320 --> 00:37:47,520
like you've got different chemistries at work and you've got different laws of physics at work in

361
00:37:47,520 --> 00:37:53,920
the north and south poles right okay but but there is there is a difference in in ocean

362
00:37:53,920 --> 00:37:59,440
circulation there's a huge difference in the amount of warming and and sorry but but i think

363
00:37:59,440 --> 00:38:04,480
let's focus on the thing that we're talking about because once you start saying yeah but in another

364
00:38:04,480 --> 00:38:08,400
situation it's completely different yeah in another situation it is completely different

365
00:38:08,400 --> 00:38:13,600
i think we can both agree on that there are reasons there are reasons why things happen

366
00:38:13,600 --> 00:38:22,400
in antarctica for example it happened in the arctic too let's deal with the arctic then and

367
00:38:22,400 --> 00:38:28,640
the north atlantic and the paper that is now the one that's under discussion what i'm interested

368
00:38:28,640 --> 00:38:33,680
in knowing is that you disagree with the the paper and i'm what i'm trying to get at is

369
00:38:33,680 --> 00:38:39,280
what is it you disagree with when they say that the fresh water on top is staying on top because

370
00:38:39,280 --> 00:38:45,440
it's warmer because it has a heat content whereas if it cooled as we know from basic physics cool

371
00:38:45,440 --> 00:38:50,880
water tends to sink and so you disagree with the conclusions of the paper and i'm trying to find

372
00:38:50,880 --> 00:38:57,120
out why you think that cool water would not sink and restart the ocean circulation what is it that

373
00:38:57,120 --> 00:39:02,160
you know that these researchers don't know because this is the exact same thing that happened

374
00:39:02,160 --> 00:39:06,320
when the arctic had its record ice recovery

375
00:39:08,320 --> 00:39:13,920
with respect it's not um the the arctic doesn't have the same overturning circulation

376
00:39:15,120 --> 00:39:21,040
we are talking about the other the other thing is the arctic is a lot colder the ant sorry i

377
00:39:21,040 --> 00:39:26,080
wasn't sorry i might have missed something you you say that again i'm sorry that was probably my

378
00:39:26,080 --> 00:39:31,680
fault all right so yes okay i did include that thing about the about the antarctic

379
00:39:31,680 --> 00:39:38,000
but during that same time they had what up north what they called a record recovery

380
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:43,440
of the arctic ice there was a spike back up and during that brief period and of course it's all

381
00:39:43,440 --> 00:39:48,080
gone now we're at record low now but if you'll recall and i don't remember if it was exactly

382
00:39:48,080 --> 00:39:52,800
at the time when antarctica was at record high or it was slightly after but there was that period

383
00:39:52,800 --> 00:40:00,240
where there was the uh the record recovery from the low point in summer to where it was in winter

384
00:40:00,240 --> 00:40:08,800
and it had a great winter and the explanation for that was more cold fresh water melted off

385
00:40:08,800 --> 00:40:15,520
into the ocean so i emailed him after the discussion and asked him to cite the study that

386
00:40:15,520 --> 00:40:21,120
said the explanation for that record recovery was more fresh water melted off into the ocean

387
00:40:21,920 --> 00:40:28,080
his response it didn't come from a scientific study it was on a social media site ben doesn't

388
00:40:28,080 --> 00:40:34,320
remember what year it was but he remembers there was a post from michael man and some guy from noah

389
00:40:34,320 --> 00:40:39,600
whose name he can't remember he doesn't remember which ice recovery was being referred to but he

390
00:40:39,600 --> 00:40:45,360
says it was in the last 10 years and it was a record recovery so that can only be the record

391
00:40:45,360 --> 00:40:53,280
ice advance of 2012-2013 unfortunately ben didn't keep a copy so i have no idea what was actually

392
00:40:53,280 --> 00:41:00,000
written in that post or what study it was based on if any so let's go to the actual study which

393
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:06,720
shows the scientific explanation they don't say the recovery was due to ice melting into the ocean

394
00:41:06,720 --> 00:41:12,880
they say the opposite it was caused by a lack of melt a definitive study published in nature

395
00:41:12,880 --> 00:41:19,360
geoscience concluded that the increase was driven by the retention of thick sea ice northwest of

396
00:41:19,360 --> 00:41:26,000
greenland during 2013 which in turn was associated with a five percent drop in the number of days on

397
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:31,120
which melting occurred so we moved on to other issues which i'll have to put in part two of this

398
00:41:31,120 --> 00:41:35,840
conversation when i get around to mixing it with the graphics i go on assignment in the middle of

399
00:41:35,840 --> 00:41:41,520
april which is why i had to get this done quickly i've got another timely video to post this week

400
00:41:41,520 --> 00:41:46,880
plus my discussion with academic agent another youtuber and i'm putting the final touches to

401
00:41:46,880 --> 00:41:52,080
a regular video that i hope to post before i leave it's going to be unusually busy on

402
00:41:52,080 --> 00:41:55,360
this channel for the next couple of weeks thanks for watching
