WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:05.680
the first half of the discussion I had with Ben Davidson, aka Suspicious Observers. This came out

00:05.680 --> 00:11.520
of his claims that I'd lied and deliberately misrepresented one of his videos, and his call

00:11.520 --> 00:18.000
for a live debate on my alleged misdeeds. Two days before we were due to talk, Ben told me it wasn't

00:18.000 --> 00:24.080
going out live after all, and I had no time to get that organised from my side. So I asked Ben to send

00:24.080 --> 00:29.040
me the audio file, which he very kindly did, and I'd been matching it to the images I was showing

00:29.040 --> 00:34.240
him during our discussion. Since the discussion I've also fact-checked some of his claims that

00:34.240 --> 00:39.120
I couldn't check in the middle of the discussion, and also added a couple of graphics to illustrate

00:39.120 --> 00:44.560
what we're talking about. I make it very clear when these are added, and pause the audio when

00:44.560 --> 00:50.640
I add them, without cutting the audio at all. The only things I've cut out, with Ben's permission,

00:50.640 --> 00:56.160
are where we had technical issues of no sound or no images. So if Ben wants to post this on his

00:56.160 --> 01:01.520
channel without the fact-checks, he can do so seamlessly by simply cutting them out. Anyway,

01:01.520 --> 01:11.920
here goes. Well listen, you go first, because you were the one who thought my video was

01:13.600 --> 01:21.920
misrepresenting you, so I'm happy to listen to that. Alright, so I'd rather not hurl accusations

01:21.920 --> 01:27.120
at you, what I'd rather do is sort of go through some of the things right now, and

01:28.960 --> 01:32.160
you tell me where I'm going wrong, okay? Okay, sure.

01:35.680 --> 01:40.160
And I'll start with the fact that where you had crossed off Ice Age and put Interglacial,

01:40.800 --> 01:45.440
I kind of figured that all the stuff above that was what happened during the Interglacial. We're

01:45.440 --> 01:50.080
in the Interglacial, and so the way I saw it is, you know, we're in the Ice Age for a long time,

01:50.160 --> 01:55.360
there's glaciers forming at the poles, obviously, there's ice up there, and then there's ice also

01:55.360 --> 01:59.840
at lower latitudes. Maybe not at what we would consider low latitude, but at least at mid

01:59.840 --> 02:07.360
latitudes, latitudes that are lower. As I understood it, Earth was in an Ice Age and

02:07.360 --> 02:14.480
had been in many Ice Ages where, unlike today where we see ice semi-permanently at the polar

02:14.480 --> 02:20.720
regions or at some places of the poles permanently right now, there were glaciers at lower latitudes

02:20.720 --> 02:29.440
as well. For example, in the Great Lakes region, and probably parts of Scandinavia, things like

02:29.440 --> 02:37.120
that. And so what happens is it doesn't all just start to melt right away. What happens is the

02:37.120 --> 02:43.360
glaciers at mid latitudes start to melt, but while that is happening, at the polar region,

02:44.000 --> 02:50.800
there is much more accumulation of ice. There's a lot more, it's not like the whole planet starts

02:50.800 --> 02:56.560
melting all at once. So we're in an Ice Age and that's how it is. And that 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 was

02:56.560 --> 03:03.040
supposed to be the story of the Interglacial. And 5 was supposed to be a question mark as to how that

03:03.040 --> 03:11.920
was actually going to happen. So as I saw it, as opposed to ice accumulating everywhere, the first

03:11.920 --> 03:17.360
thing we notice in an interglacial is that the ice is accumulating only at the poles,

03:18.080 --> 03:28.320
as opposed to everywhere. And that is what drops Earth's albedo. The fact that we went from having

03:28.320 --> 03:35.120
ice everywhere to ice being accumulating at the poles. Now, because this is just apparently the

03:35.120 --> 03:40.160
first video in this series that you've commented on, it is a bit like coming into Wednesday in

03:40.160 --> 03:46.320
week 9 in a seminar class. And so we've been talking about the different phases of ice.

03:46.320 --> 03:51.600
There's ice accumulating everywhere, there's ice accumulating at the poles, and then there's ice

03:51.600 --> 03:59.120
melting everywhere. Those are basically the only 3 phases Earth has. And so as we come out of a

03:59.120 --> 04:04.400
glacial period and we go into the interglacial, the story of that is we go from having ice

04:04.400 --> 04:09.920
everywhere to ice accumulating at the poles only. When this happens, Earth's albedo drops.

04:10.560 --> 04:17.120
The planet warms up even further. Eventually, that warmth overtakes the poles too.

04:18.320 --> 04:23.120
CO2 is released, even more methane is released. While it's heating up, more water vapor is going

04:23.120 --> 04:30.000
into the atmosphere. And yet, the question mark, number 5, always an ice age has followed. And that

04:30.080 --> 04:34.800
seems to, we didn't attempt to give an answer to that. We just sort of said that is what has

04:34.800 --> 04:42.640
happened. And correct me if I'm wrong, there was still CO2 and methane releases and water vapor

04:43.600 --> 04:48.960
increases in the atmosphere during the previous interglacials, right? And something always throws

04:48.960 --> 04:54.160
us back into an ice age. Okay. Right. Can I start with you there? Because I've been taking notes,

04:54.160 --> 04:59.520
and there's a lot to get through on that. The first thing is, I did get the impression from

04:59.600 --> 05:06.720
a lot of your subscribers that they saw some sort of hidden references behind all this,

05:06.720 --> 05:10.880
that clearly, now that you tell me this is part of a series of things you've been doing,

05:12.320 --> 05:22.080
that makes a lot more sense. Because taken on its own, this video did suggest that ice accumulate,

05:22.080 --> 05:27.200
well, okay, I won't go into that. I'll show you the timeline a bit later. But I think what you're

05:27.200 --> 05:37.120
not getting, let me ask you what you think, okay, what you don't get is why we go from an

05:37.120 --> 05:42.560
interglacial. You can understand why we go from a glaciation into an interglacial. But what I

05:42.560 --> 05:48.080
noticed was you said somehow we go from an interglacial back into a glaciation. That's

05:48.080 --> 05:54.240
going from a warm interglacial like we have now back into what you call an ice age. Now,

05:54.240 --> 05:58.880
you said somehow, which suggests that you don't think that there is any scientific explanation

05:58.880 --> 06:03.600
for that. So first of all, let me just clarify, do you think there is a scientific explanation

06:03.600 --> 06:10.080
for that? And do you know what that scientific explanation is? I have read it. And I think that

06:10.080 --> 06:17.200
your video did a very good job explaining. You know, I sort of mentioned Milankovitch cycles

06:18.000 --> 06:21.520
in a moment, and you just sort of did a much better job explaining what those are.

06:22.160 --> 06:33.840
I have read a good deal about that. At the moment, you know, there's a big disconnect because

06:34.400 --> 06:39.200
the same things that were happening in the atmosphere every previous time or the same

06:39.200 --> 06:44.320
things that were happening in space with Earth every single time, those things are happening

06:44.320 --> 06:54.560
again now. And so what is the disconnect? What is happening now that isn't just a faster version,

06:54.560 --> 07:00.400
a more extreme version of what happened before? If you have a good answer to that.

07:00.400 --> 07:05.040
Okay, I'll answer that. I'll answer that. The first thing I can tell you that's happening now

07:05.040 --> 07:11.440
that never happened before is that we're getting carbon dioxide levels up to concentrations that

07:11.440 --> 07:15.680
we have never seen in any interglacial before. So the first thing that's extraordinary about

07:15.680 --> 07:20.320
what's happening now is the level of carbon dioxide. If you look back at interglacials in the

07:20.320 --> 07:26.240
past, there was never this kind of CO2 concentration simply because there was never this kind of fossil

07:26.240 --> 07:32.080
fuel burning. So we've had basically a 50% increase in the amount of CO2 in the atmosphere

07:32.080 --> 07:35.520
because we've been burning fossil fuels. That's one thing that's different. But I want to bring

07:35.520 --> 07:41.600
you back to one thing you said which was that what is happening now is what happened before

07:41.600 --> 07:48.240
in the sense of, from what I understand of your hypothesis, your idea of how this works,

07:48.240 --> 07:55.840
you think that ice melts at the poles, comes down to the lower latitudes, cuts off circulation,

07:55.840 --> 08:02.720
ice forms at the lower latitudes, this causes us to go into an ice age or what geologists would

08:02.720 --> 08:15.600
call a glaciation. That's not quite it. It's a larger process of things but the desalinization

08:15.600 --> 08:22.560
is a big portion of it. I mean the the salinization level of the ocean could be as important as the

08:22.560 --> 08:32.320
CO2 level in the troposphere. My question to you would be, do you believe that

08:32.320 --> 08:38.080
everything we pump into the troposphere can just stay here at you know higher and higher densities

08:38.080 --> 08:42.800
without bleeding more and more into the oceans and up into the stratosphere and in the ocean?

08:42.800 --> 08:48.960
No no no because because the science now, look I can only follow what the researchers

08:48.960 --> 08:55.040
have measured. 50% has stayed up there. 50% basically goes into the biosphere and the oceans

08:55.040 --> 08:59.360
but can I, sorry, I don't want to stray away from this point because it's an important one.

08:59.360 --> 09:06.480
I want to establish what it is you think that is happening now that also happened to bring an end

09:06.480 --> 09:11.200
to the interglacials in the past. There's something you think that is happening now that also happened

09:11.200 --> 09:15.840
that brought the past interglacials to a close. I'm trying to establish what that is. What I'm

09:15.840 --> 09:22.000
saying is the only thing that is different is the is how much pollution humans have put into

09:22.000 --> 09:27.680
the atmosphere. That's the only thing really that that's different. Just a quick fact check here so

09:27.680 --> 09:32.800
you can see what we're talking about. The level of CO2 during most interglacials doesn't go much

09:32.800 --> 09:40.160
above 280 parts per million. That's the blue line. In the last 200 years it's gone from 280 to over

09:40.160 --> 09:47.520
400 parts per million in just 200 years. That's the red line. I mean if you look at the timing

09:48.560 --> 09:52.560
you mean if you look at the timing of this interglacial this has been a fairly long

09:52.560 --> 09:59.840
interglacial. Really? I mean compared to the last couple wouldn't you say?

10:01.440 --> 10:08.240
Well the one that you pointed to when you did your second video rebutting mine you actually

10:08.240 --> 10:11.920
clarified what you were talking about which was then clear that you were talking about coming out

10:11.920 --> 10:17.360
of a glaciation. You were looking at termination 4. That was the example you gave of us coming out

10:17.360 --> 10:23.040
of a glaciation. Well out of termination 4 the interglacial lasted about 50,000 60,000 years.

10:23.760 --> 10:30.640
Now we're only about 11,000 into our interglacial so we have a long way to go yet.

10:30.640 --> 10:36.400
Others are much shorter but you also get into glacials that are much longer. So I mean these

10:36.400 --> 10:43.680
are not insignificant time periods. But again I don't want to stray away from the point that

10:43.680 --> 10:50.480
I'm trying to get to. You said somehow we come out of this glacial this interglacial.

10:50.480 --> 10:56.320
I'm trying to establish what it is you think scientists say because you're suggesting that

10:56.320 --> 11:02.240
maybe scientists don't know. No I'm not suggesting that and it's not like every scientist in the

11:02.240 --> 11:08.720
world says it's the exact same things and puts the exact same attribution on all of them.

11:08.800 --> 11:18.320
You know I am not sure whether you fully understand what we were trying to do or what we

11:18.320 --> 11:29.600
were trying to communicate there. But this is not always meant to be telling the exact line of what

11:29.600 --> 11:37.120
peer-reviewed science is. Okay all right but let me just tell you what the science says and then

11:37.120 --> 11:43.600
you can tell me why they're wrong. That would be the easiest way. According to the science

11:44.240 --> 11:49.200
these cycles happen and they're very regular cycles. I mean they've got a periodicity of

11:49.200 --> 11:54.800
about a hundred thousand years and they happen because of Milankovitch cycle. So we go into

11:55.840 --> 12:01.920
a glaciation because the earth gets less sunlight because of the tilt and the wobble of the earth's

12:01.920 --> 12:08.480
axis and its orbit. We get less sunlight and that little bit of less sunlight causes

12:09.360 --> 12:13.040
the earth to cool a little bit which gives us more ice which gives us more albedo.

12:13.600 --> 12:20.000
That causes the oceans to degas CO2 and carbon dioxide being a very powerful greenhouse gas

12:20.560 --> 12:26.560
sorry to absorb CO2 because it's more soluble in colder water. That takes CO2 out of the

12:26.560 --> 12:30.160
atmosphere and that continues the cooling. So there's a kind of a positive feedback

12:30.160 --> 12:35.200
which accelerates this cooling. Now coming out of that is when we get the Milankovitch cycles

12:35.200 --> 12:45.680
work in the opposite way where we get an increase in insulation and that causes less ice that means

12:45.680 --> 12:52.080
less albedo. CO2 is degas from the oceans and CO2 is a powerful greenhouse gas so it warms the earth

12:52.080 --> 12:58.000
even further and again we get a positive feedback. You suggested that that ought to cause runaway

12:58.000 --> 13:01.680
warming but there's no reason why that should cause runaway warming. I did not suggest that

13:01.680 --> 13:09.440
that would cause runaway warming. I put that at the at the end as a as a as like sort of like a

13:09.440 --> 13:15.040
footnote or end note to the the very clear periodicity and one of your commenters hit me

13:15.040 --> 13:19.840
hard and said hey look take a look during your supposed ice ages there's little spikes up here

13:19.840 --> 13:25.280
and there and I had to explain that I wasn't suggesting that Milankovitch cycles were responsible

13:25.280 --> 13:31.360
for every up and down on that chart but the very clear periodicity that I imagine a five or six

13:31.360 --> 13:36.560
year old could say hey do you see the pattern of things going up and down spiking up and going

13:36.560 --> 13:41.600
absolutely you know I said yeah what I was saying was hey if you wanted to know more about that

13:41.600 --> 13:47.440
you could look into Milankovitch cycles that was all I said. Yeah and so there's no real mystery

13:47.440 --> 13:51.760
then about why we're going in and out of glaciations or do you still think there's

13:51.760 --> 13:57.520
no but but all right so so here's here's the point and here let me if I may run you through

13:57.520 --> 14:02.000
weeks one through eight that you missed and you can maybe tell me if something's going wrong here

14:02.880 --> 14:10.720
all right so sooner or later and I have actually read a couple different things about where we are

14:10.720 --> 14:16.880
in the Milankovitch cycles but we are not exactly in the the favorable side if if you want a warmer

14:16.880 --> 14:22.480
planet we are gonna you know basically from here on out we are going towards the colder period

14:23.120 --> 14:28.160
now that's not something that's going to be playing in our lifetimes all right but it's

14:28.160 --> 14:33.040
something that should be thought of when they're talking about you know hundreds thousands of years

14:33.040 --> 14:40.800
ahead of time for right now here are the points that we have made that that makes us that make us

14:40.800 --> 14:46.240
think that the planet is about to cool down and first and foremost is a combination of political

14:46.240 --> 14:53.120
pressure continually worsening extreme weather and technological innovations are going to reduce

14:53.120 --> 14:59.760
carbon emissions never underestimate human ingenuity or the power of disasters and propaganda

14:59.760 --> 15:06.800
both good and bad propaganda there is almost no question in my mind that if you have any foresight

15:06.800 --> 15:13.360
you can see the wild reduction of pollution of this planet it is not at all hard to see

15:14.080 --> 15:21.920
if that occurs it's not like the desalinization of the oceans stops immediately those do increase

15:21.920 --> 15:28.800
the freeze potential of the oceans in winter and they disrupt critical ocean currents they do help

15:28.800 --> 15:35.920
stratify the ocean and partially incarcerate the sea floor methane releases now while that is

15:35.920 --> 15:41.440
happening and it's not like if we stop polluting tomorrow the the warmth in the arctic that we've

15:42.080 --> 15:47.360
been noticing anomalously is going to just suddenly disappear but we've learned that

15:47.360 --> 15:54.320
the warm arctic is not the you know is another way to have a weaker polar vortex

15:54.960 --> 15:59.600
early sudden stratospheric warming events and create more jet stream blocking that was what

15:59.600 --> 16:05.520
i showed in in the actual video now what i brought back in during the discussion was the fact that we

16:05.520 --> 16:13.680
had seen tons of articles about how low solar activity weakens the polar vortex increases early

16:13.680 --> 16:19.040
sudden stratospheric warming events and creates more jet stream blocking and so what we will have

16:19.040 --> 16:24.880
here is the sun entering a significant minimum the arctic will still be warm even if we stop

16:24.880 --> 16:31.760
pollution and both of those things will force weaker polar vortex increases in sudden uh

16:31.760 --> 16:38.160
stratospheric warmings and more jet stream blocking now specifically on the decreased solar

16:38.800 --> 16:48.480
you know this idea of 0.1 change over the solar cycle being the sun's influence in climate is

16:48.480 --> 16:55.680
absolutely preposterous and if you saw the solar forcing for cmip6 when that does come out it will

16:55.680 --> 17:01.360
no longer be restricted to that 0.1 the solar scientists have stood up and said that is

17:01.840 --> 17:07.840
uncharacteristically preposterous because there's also x-ray radiation and their solar energetic

17:07.840 --> 17:14.400
particles along with the indirect connection to galactic cosmic rays the ionization of the cloud

17:14.400 --> 17:20.160
layer etc offering less energy while earth's albedo profile goes up due to cosmic rays

17:21.680 --> 17:25.920
and so that's going to be happening more and more as we enter into that significant solar

17:25.920 --> 17:33.680
minimum this century all these things should be happening this century um okay and you know this

17:33.680 --> 17:40.560
is this is all fine but i mean uh i really i thought we were here to to talk about my

17:41.280 --> 17:46.080
misrepresentations of what you'd said so i'd really like to get back onto that i i mean all

17:46.080 --> 17:52.720
your theories are great and i i have no idea how much uh evidence you've got to support this because

17:52.720 --> 17:58.240
you know what i would need to do is look at your sources and go through them um so could could we

17:58.240 --> 18:04.320
just go back um would you mind if i i talk about you know what we were here to debate which was

18:04.960 --> 18:10.160
my misrepresentations of your video and what you said in that video i'm sure that you said a lot of

18:10.160 --> 18:16.240
things in other videos and i'm sure that this is the eighth in a series and that one through seven

18:16.240 --> 18:20.720
talked about all sorts of other things but i really can't get into those now because i haven't

18:20.720 --> 18:27.600
seen those videos on it so let's just deal with this video what i want to know is why why and i

18:27.600 --> 18:32.240
don't know if you did this in comments or if there was some other video or on or you did this on

18:32.240 --> 18:41.200
facebook or whatever because i i don't understand how this happened but i got literally over 800

18:41.920 --> 18:48.400
comments within the span of 24 hours all saying virtually the same thing

18:49.360 --> 18:57.520
that i didn't understand what those papers were saying and that i didn't have any basis

18:58.320 --> 19:04.160
whatsoever in talking okay then then let's talk about that because i suspect the reason they said

19:04.160 --> 19:08.400
that was because you didn't understand what the papers were saying now if you want to say

19:08.400 --> 19:12.960
you did understand that's absolutely fine with me and and that's what i would like to talk about so

19:13.600 --> 19:23.760
um what i've got um is um is is what you what you said uh about um about my video i mean i'm

19:23.760 --> 19:28.640
i'm happy to talk about one of the papers if you want to if you want me to talk about which paper

19:28.640 --> 19:34.400
did you think i misunderstood well here's the thing i wasn't i was not attempting to represent

19:34.400 --> 19:42.000
the conclusions of the papers i was not attempting to do that i know but let's go with what you

19:42.000 --> 19:47.680
actually said you you were you were doing let me just play you this this clip and this is from your

19:47.680 --> 19:53.040
your video okay cold fresh water and various atmospheric connections send us spiraling into

19:53.040 --> 19:59.200
an ice age thereafter just this month we learned that part of that process may include that extra

19:59.200 --> 20:05.120
cold fresh water creating a stratification in the oceans that halts convection not to mention the

20:05.120 --> 20:17.120
golf stream so um all that this was all i was meant to do and um this may help you understand

20:17.120 --> 20:27.440
a lot um i put i put huge faith in observations i put much less faith in interpretations and

20:27.440 --> 20:33.200
conclusions based on those and um frankly i have the track record to back that up

20:33.760 --> 20:39.040
um this the only thing i cared about was we have been looking and waiting for the story that says

20:39.040 --> 20:44.720
that there is an increased freshening of that water and the reason we've been waiting for that

20:44.720 --> 20:49.440
is because we've been waiting for the Beaufort Gyre to release we've been waiting for that for

20:50.320 --> 20:53.520
three times longer than we've ever supposed to have waited for that before

20:54.560 --> 21:00.800
and it's not like people are just stationed up there taking measurements of the current all the

21:00.800 --> 21:06.240
time it's not like you can put buoys okay so basically this paper you're you're saying this

21:06.240 --> 21:13.680
paper doesn't support what you were saying about uh the um this this cold water being part of the

21:13.680 --> 21:22.800
process that leads into an ice age you agree that it doesn't support that it it supports my overall

21:22.800 --> 21:29.760
thesis that we could have a mini ice age like event this century and all we were looking for

21:29.760 --> 21:35.920
was the increased freshening of the surface water all right so this is your theory this

21:35.920 --> 21:39.920
is something you've come up with this has been what this whole thing is about the notion that

21:39.920 --> 21:47.200
hey look we are we're about to see pollution take a dive while there are everywhere you look

21:47.200 --> 21:54.560
signals that cold is coming or at least cold yeah yeah but no no it doesn't it doesn't sorry

21:54.800 --> 22:00.800
this is where this is where i'm i'm i can actually begin to disagree with what you're saying here

22:00.800 --> 22:08.560
because um you say cold is coming you're talking about global cold i'm talking as you know are you

22:08.560 --> 22:16.480
not i'm talking about another mini ice age like event we had in the 1400s to 1600s but something

22:16.480 --> 22:21.120
like that okay that's okay that was called the little ice age which is global cold you are

22:21.120 --> 22:28.320
talking about global temperatures getting cooler rather than warmer yes okay right now that we've

22:28.320 --> 22:33.520
established that you agree that these papers don't support that but this is basically just your idea

22:33.520 --> 22:38.560
we've already established in fact i did play in my video the part where you do say that they don't

22:38.560 --> 22:43.840
support it so i'm not trying to misrepresent what you said but you did say that we learned

22:44.800 --> 22:51.200
this month and um in fact you were showing this paper uh suggesting that we learned from this

22:51.200 --> 22:55.200
paper so all i'm saying is well we didn't learn it from this paper this is something that you

22:55.200 --> 23:00.720
have come up with and you would agree uh all this paper does is show that there will there is

23:01.520 --> 23:08.080
cold fresh water coming down from the arctic and it's hovering above the saline water the

23:08.080 --> 23:13.520
more saline water of the overturning circulation and possibly cutting it off so that's basically

23:13.600 --> 23:18.880
what the paper says the rest of it is is all your interpretation i think we're agreed on that are we

23:19.520 --> 23:26.160
yes but that has never been something i so is this whole thing going to be about like you didn't

23:26.160 --> 23:32.560
realize that i was giving my my hypothesis and my things about this and you don't think i have

23:32.560 --> 23:39.760
the chops to do it should we just skip to where i no no no no not at all not at all i'm just trying

23:39.760 --> 23:46.640
to establish um uh that one of the one of the things you said was that somehow i had misled

23:46.640 --> 23:54.720
people uh in to saying that you were claiming that these papers uh somehow uh did not support

23:54.720 --> 24:00.000
the warming or something like that i can play you the clip but but basically what i'm showing is

24:00.000 --> 24:06.000
that uh there was a slight misrepresentation in that you did say that we're learning from these

24:06.000 --> 24:12.160
papers that this is part of the process that leads into it i think that was a very i think

24:12.160 --> 24:17.360
that was a kind way of saying it if you were just to walk into this seminar week nine in this video

24:17.360 --> 24:23.840
the whole thing seems like of a wild misrepresentation i think okay well that's

24:23.840 --> 24:29.920
fine so i didn't misread anything no but what you did you you would agree but what you did was

24:29.920 --> 24:35.120
even you would agree that if you just watch this video and you haven't watched the entire series

24:35.120 --> 24:39.200
of which most people when they watch youtube videos they watch a video because it's got an

24:39.200 --> 24:45.040
interesting headline they read they watch it and they get kind of taken in by it now if they

24:45.040 --> 24:50.800
haven't seen the previous seven they wouldn't know uh what this video is saying so when you say well

24:50.800 --> 24:54.960
you know you're misrepresenting what i said actually i'm just taking exactly what you said

24:54.960 --> 25:00.000
now that maybe that there were a lot of thoughts behind that that you didn't put out in the video

25:00.000 --> 25:03.600
there were a lot of things that you'd said earlier that were not in this video that's fine

25:04.080 --> 25:08.160
uh i'm just saying that this is what you were putting out in this video which a lot of people

25:08.160 --> 25:13.680
would see without having seen the entire series i i strongly disagree the only reason why so many

25:13.680 --> 25:19.520
people are going to see this is because of what you did i am not discoverable easily unless you

25:19.520 --> 25:25.520
type my name in i am intentionally hard to discover on youtube no no i've seen your name

25:25.520 --> 25:30.640
before yes you've seen my name before because it pops up on on a lot of your videos and we've

25:30.640 --> 25:35.920
talked about the same kind of thing a lot of times but it's not like somebody could

25:35.920 --> 25:40.320
go type in climate change and my name would ever come up in a million years

25:42.000 --> 25:47.760
but even so i think i think we we all have a responsibility to represent if that is the case

25:47.760 --> 25:52.160
you had i think you had a responsibility to send me an email and say hey what are you doing or at

25:52.160 --> 25:57.920
least go and try to find some of my other videos on on the climate because what ended up happening

25:57.920 --> 26:04.000
is a bunch of people hundreds of people didn't know what happened and they came and my god some

26:04.000 --> 26:12.880
of your viewers were so horrendously vulgar listen i can't i'm sorry i i had a lot from yours as well

26:12.880 --> 26:18.080
so i can't be responsible for what people post on your videos but and i'm sure you can't be

26:18.080 --> 26:25.440
responsible for what people uh know but but the idea let's not get in but can we talk about the

26:25.440 --> 26:29.920
science yes because i'm not getting into an argument about what i was talking somebody posted

26:29.920 --> 26:34.240
something that you found offensive what i was talking about and what offended me was the notion

26:34.240 --> 26:41.520
that this was portrayed to be something it wasn't this was portrayed to be then that's what that's

26:41.520 --> 26:46.640
what this discussion is about then that's what this discussion is about so let's get to the bottom

26:46.640 --> 26:54.160
of whether this this was fair enough or not um now you you did say um you need to go to the studies

26:54.160 --> 27:00.560
on this right uh uh the um the study that you're talking about is this one by altman's you've read

27:00.560 --> 27:08.080
this study have you yeah if you're going to ask me to remember specific lines out of it i i'm not

27:08.080 --> 27:13.600
i'm not but you did obviously read the study um you know because you're quoting the study and you

27:13.600 --> 27:18.800
did advise people to go and read the study rather than just the summary so i'm just establishing that

27:18.800 --> 27:26.400
you actually did read that study yes sir okay um now it doesn't and and i think we can agree it

27:26.400 --> 27:31.280
doesn't concur with your idea that uh this is going to lead into an ice age we've already

27:31.280 --> 27:37.840
established that how about whether it concurs that the cold water coming south is likely to freeze is

27:37.840 --> 27:42.560
there anything in the paper that suggests that i did not suggest that that is where that information

27:42.560 --> 27:48.000
came from that was something that people already you did no no i didn't say that i was just asking

27:48.000 --> 27:53.200
no nothing in this paper says that but as long as people realize i didn't say it did

27:54.320 --> 27:59.760
i didn't say this paper said that no but does it does it contradict that though um

28:01.680 --> 28:07.600
maybe i i don't remember uh exactly that's not really the reason i was reading this paper like

28:07.600 --> 28:14.560
for example i didn't pay much attention to the methods section of this paper okay no i very

28:14.560 --> 28:20.320
rarely do either but um what do you think um i mean do you disagree with the paper put it that

28:20.320 --> 28:26.080
way is there anything in the paper that you disagree with i think they got you know i i do

28:26.080 --> 28:30.720
remember the answer is yes but i don't remember what that was exactly at this time and frankly

28:30.720 --> 28:36.880
the the majority of my problems with these papers is the fact that you know because of how many

28:36.880 --> 28:41.840
papers come out in the climate realm even though we have known what solar forcing is going to be

28:41.840 --> 28:48.720
for cmip6 for a year now um and even though there have been hundreds of papers that are going to be

28:48.720 --> 28:55.040
included in the next update when it comes out there is nobody who's using anything but cmip5

28:55.040 --> 29:02.640
for these studies and it this is by necessity you couldn't expect you know even these three people

29:02.640 --> 29:09.040
and if they had 10 students working with them to go and figure out what the what all the new

29:09.040 --> 29:13.360
variables would be in their model between the time they submitted the paper and it got published

29:13.360 --> 29:19.120
bunch of those variables would change you know okay what was the conclusion of the paper dude

29:19.120 --> 29:22.800
i know it's been a while since you read it but basically what was its conclusion

29:25.680 --> 29:35.200
um man i i'm racking my brain here this uh was this the one that was talking about um

29:35.840 --> 29:40.560
the accumulation versus uh the accumulated retention versus the release amount

29:41.440 --> 29:46.240
the paper we're looking at is the one ben mentioned here and that he's citing it's the

29:46.240 --> 29:52.160
paper from which ben said we learned that part of the process of glaciation may include extra cold

29:52.160 --> 29:57.920
fresh water creating a stratification in the oceans the paper does say that fresh water will

29:57.920 --> 30:03.840
be injected into the atlantic but it does not say that that is part of the process of glaciation

30:03.840 --> 30:08.480
so we did not learn this from the paper if you want to check this i've cited the paper

30:08.480 --> 30:13.840
in the video description this is the one that was talking about an increased uh risk well are you

30:13.840 --> 30:19.120
seeing the the screenshot in front of you i'm seeing it but it's a little blurry in terms of the

30:19.120 --> 30:26.000
words okay the headline of the paper is increased risk of a shutdown of ocean convection posed by

30:26.000 --> 30:31.520
warm north atlantic summers okay um which pretty much says it all you know that that was the one

30:31.760 --> 30:38.880
that um i just played on your clip that you suggested showed that this would stop the

30:38.880 --> 30:46.720
overturning circulation of the uh atlantic and it would keep the cool fresh water on top and and the

30:46.720 --> 30:52.560
saline water underneath stop the circulation now your your theory is that that would lead to

30:52.560 --> 31:00.640
freezing of this um top layer of cold water not all it's not like it's going to freeze down off

31:00.640 --> 31:09.920
the coast of north carolina man but as more ice enters the water and as it loses its saline

31:09.920 --> 31:17.200
its saline profile we will see spikes in ice i mean but how did we get record high Antarctic

31:17.200 --> 31:24.160
ice all right all right let's deal with that then if we're going to see spikes in ice you do you

31:24.160 --> 31:29.680
know that the conclusion of the paper was the complete opposite i am aware of that the reason

31:29.680 --> 31:35.600
but we have seen the opposite happen in both the north and the south over just the last decade

31:35.600 --> 31:42.560
in 2013 and 2014 there was record high Antarctic ice and then we didn't have record high arctic

31:42.560 --> 31:48.640
ice but we saw uh what they called a record recovery of the arctic just a couple years

31:48.640 --> 31:54.160
ago i think you you you misunderstand me when i say that its conclusion is the complete opposite

31:54.160 --> 31:59.120
i'm not saying it's the complete opposite of your your theory i mean that's that's something else

31:59.120 --> 32:06.320
we're talking about specifics you say that the uh the water on top will freeze now in fact what

32:06.320 --> 32:12.320
the paper concludes and the paper is is quite clear on on the quantity of heat coming out

32:12.320 --> 32:16.480
have you got um can you see now the middle of the paper which i'm showing you with

32:16.480 --> 32:24.240
two red boxes one left one left and one right right um they talk about um regressing on the

32:24.240 --> 32:28.720
left-hand side regressing the results on both summer indices we find that the salinity anomaly

32:28.720 --> 32:35.360
accounts for an energy surplus of around 2.8 times 10 to the 8th joules per square meter

32:35.360 --> 32:42.400
after fresh erminia sea summers and around 4.8 times 10 to the uh power of 8 joules per square

32:42.400 --> 32:47.280
meter after fresh labrador summers now we can go on and and look at their conclusions

32:48.080 --> 32:55.200
and their conclusions actually say that the that the reason uh the bit because we've got this

32:55.200 --> 33:00.240
this layer of fresh water on top the reason it's not sinking is not because it's too cold

33:00.240 --> 33:07.840
but because it's too warm and if it got colder it would sink because of course uh colder colder

33:07.840 --> 33:13.680
water does sink and then the circulation would would be okay the reason the circulation is not

33:13.680 --> 33:19.440
working is because the water is too warm so in fact those figures which um i haven't heard you

33:19.440 --> 33:25.520
disputing uh show that in fact this water is too warm it wouldn't freeze it would simply drop and

33:25.520 --> 33:31.360
cause the circulation to continue um this is not just my interpretation of the paper and i i read

33:31.360 --> 33:37.200
the paper uh new scientist says exactly the same thing um and this is a clip from new scientist

33:37.200 --> 33:42.320
which i'm showing you now um the fresh water poses the threat to convection it has been

33:43.040 --> 33:51.200
water it has to be cool um so i'm very aware of this conclusion but oh you are okay

33:53.280 --> 33:55.200
i thought you didn't know what the conclusion was

33:56.560 --> 34:00.560
well i mean i i remember it now but that would be the part i disagreed with

34:02.560 --> 34:09.520
because why do you disagree with them because we have actually seen observations of the physical

34:09.600 --> 34:15.760
world that show the exact opposite i want to know specifically sorry specifically what do

34:15.760 --> 34:20.880
you disagree with do you disagree that cool water would sink no i don't the fresh water got colder

34:20.880 --> 34:28.640
it would sink you disagree with that no what i am saying is this same excuse of oh the the you know

34:28.640 --> 34:37.040
this is the same thing that they said caused the record high antarctic ice back in 2013 and 2014

34:37.040 --> 34:43.040
when all those websites were using the record high antarctic ice to try to slam climate science

34:43.040 --> 34:47.680
what was the proper answer yeah but but you're talking you're talking about this paper and

34:47.680 --> 34:52.160
you're talking about the north atlantic so can we get back to what i'm saying is and the north

34:52.160 --> 34:58.320
atlantic and this is the thing that you keep cutting me off you keep cutting me off man i i'm

34:58.320 --> 35:03.920
just trying to get the full thought out and you keep cutting me off and it's okay your accent your

35:03.920 --> 35:09.040
accent is so charming that it's like i i'm thrown off i don't know what to do about it

35:09.040 --> 35:17.120
but so what i'm saying is the reason given for the record high arctic recovery when it happened

35:17.120 --> 35:24.960
a couple years ago was that so much cold fresh water had melted off into it the explanation

35:25.680 --> 35:33.760
for the record high antarctic ice in 2013 and 2014 was that cold fresh water had melted off

35:36.240 --> 35:42.640
into the into the water cooled it off slightly it changed the salinity those were the i mean

35:42.640 --> 35:47.760
i wasn't part of that battle back and forth but i saw one side of the debate yelling hey like look

35:47.760 --> 35:53.120
at this we've got record high antarctic ice back then and like hey look we've got a record recovery

35:53.120 --> 35:58.080
in the arctic and i saw the other side saying well you just put a bunch of cold fresh water

35:58.080 --> 36:04.400
in there chilled it off and increased i'm sorry and and decreased the salinity what did you expect

36:04.400 --> 36:10.080
was going to happen and here we have this other paper that it observes the same thing and then

36:10.080 --> 36:20.320
uses and then uses a you know what is i suppose very good math um you know repeatable you know

36:20.320 --> 36:26.880
math can be replicated to show that something is going to happen but we have seen this exact same

36:26.880 --> 36:34.960
thing and the exact opposite happens on the planet this was the that that that water the

36:34.960 --> 36:42.800
the freshening on top and the melting of the ice that was what was supposedly causing that

36:43.760 --> 36:49.520
and it will this not have an effect on the gulf stream as well i mean i actually don't know as

36:49.520 --> 36:55.120
much about its effect on the gulf stream and the keroshe current but i mean would it not disrupt

36:55.120 --> 37:01.280
those as well eventually first of all let me apologize for interrupting you um you you're

37:01.280 --> 37:07.680
right that that was rude and i'll tell you why i did it because i i felt when we're on a track

37:07.680 --> 37:12.560
and we're on a subject um i had the experience as a journalist and i've interviewed a lot of

37:12.560 --> 37:18.720
politicians and i'm not saying you're a politician but but people do tend to to get away to other

37:18.720 --> 37:24.320
subjects and the antarctic and the arctic are completely different situations completely

37:24.320 --> 37:30.800
different so you can't say well no i wouldn't say they're completely different situations it's it's

37:30.800 --> 37:36.880
both when what i'm talking about the surface freeze it is about the temperature and the

37:36.880 --> 37:42.320
salinity profile of the water which is affected by the melting ice that is not i mean it's not

37:42.320 --> 37:47.520
like you've got different chemistries at work and you've got different laws of physics at work in

37:47.520 --> 37:53.920
the north and south poles right okay but but there is there is a difference in in ocean

37:53.920 --> 37:59.440
circulation there's a huge difference in the amount of warming and and sorry but but i think

37:59.440 --> 38:04.480
let's focus on the thing that we're talking about because once you start saying yeah but in another

38:04.480 --> 38:08.400
situation it's completely different yeah in another situation it is completely different

38:08.400 --> 38:13.600
i think we can both agree on that there are reasons there are reasons why things happen

38:13.600 --> 38:22.400
in antarctica for example it happened in the arctic too let's deal with the arctic then and

38:22.400 --> 38:28.640
the north atlantic and the paper that is now the one that's under discussion what i'm interested

38:28.640 --> 38:33.680
in knowing is that you disagree with the the paper and i'm what i'm trying to get at is

38:33.680 --> 38:39.280
what is it you disagree with when they say that the fresh water on top is staying on top because

38:39.280 --> 38:45.440
it's warmer because it has a heat content whereas if it cooled as we know from basic physics cool

38:45.440 --> 38:50.880
water tends to sink and so you disagree with the conclusions of the paper and i'm trying to find

38:50.880 --> 38:57.120
out why you think that cool water would not sink and restart the ocean circulation what is it that

38:57.120 --> 39:02.160
you know that these researchers don't know because this is the exact same thing that happened

39:02.160 --> 39:06.320
when the arctic had its record ice recovery

39:08.320 --> 39:13.920
with respect it's not um the the arctic doesn't have the same overturning circulation

39:15.120 --> 39:21.040
we are talking about the other the other thing is the arctic is a lot colder the ant sorry i

39:21.040 --> 39:26.080
wasn't sorry i might have missed something you you say that again i'm sorry that was probably my

39:26.080 --> 39:31.680
fault all right so yes okay i did include that thing about the about the antarctic

39:31.680 --> 39:38.000
but during that same time they had what up north what they called a record recovery

39:38.000 --> 39:43.440
of the arctic ice there was a spike back up and during that brief period and of course it's all

39:43.440 --> 39:48.080
gone now we're at record low now but if you'll recall and i don't remember if it was exactly

39:48.080 --> 39:52.800
at the time when antarctica was at record high or it was slightly after but there was that period

39:52.800 --> 40:00.240
where there was the uh the record recovery from the low point in summer to where it was in winter

40:00.240 --> 40:08.800
and it had a great winter and the explanation for that was more cold fresh water melted off

40:08.800 --> 40:15.520
into the ocean so i emailed him after the discussion and asked him to cite the study that

40:15.520 --> 40:21.120
said the explanation for that record recovery was more fresh water melted off into the ocean

40:21.920 --> 40:28.080
his response it didn't come from a scientific study it was on a social media site ben doesn't

40:28.080 --> 40:34.320
remember what year it was but he remembers there was a post from michael man and some guy from noah

40:34.320 --> 40:39.600
whose name he can't remember he doesn't remember which ice recovery was being referred to but he

40:39.600 --> 40:45.360
says it was in the last 10 years and it was a record recovery so that can only be the record

40:45.360 --> 40:53.280
ice advance of 2012-2013 unfortunately ben didn't keep a copy so i have no idea what was actually

40:53.280 --> 41:00.000
written in that post or what study it was based on if any so let's go to the actual study which

41:00.000 --> 41:06.720
shows the scientific explanation they don't say the recovery was due to ice melting into the ocean

41:06.720 --> 41:12.880
they say the opposite it was caused by a lack of melt a definitive study published in nature

41:12.880 --> 41:19.360
geoscience concluded that the increase was driven by the retention of thick sea ice northwest of

41:19.360 --> 41:26.000
greenland during 2013 which in turn was associated with a five percent drop in the number of days on

41:26.000 --> 41:31.120
which melting occurred so we moved on to other issues which i'll have to put in part two of this

41:31.120 --> 41:35.840
conversation when i get around to mixing it with the graphics i go on assignment in the middle of

41:35.840 --> 41:41.520
april which is why i had to get this done quickly i've got another timely video to post this week

41:41.520 --> 41:46.880
plus my discussion with academic agent another youtuber and i'm putting the final touches to

41:46.880 --> 41:52.080
a regular video that i hope to post before i leave it's going to be unusually busy on

41:52.080 --> 41:55.360
this channel for the next couple of weeks thanks for watching
