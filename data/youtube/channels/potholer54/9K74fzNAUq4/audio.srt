1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,880
It seems Christopher Monckton has responded to my video series about him, sort of.

2
00:00:04,880 --> 00:00:09,520
On the website What's Up With That, he replied not directly to the videos,

3
00:00:09,520 --> 00:00:12,400
but to a loose summary of them that someone had posted.

4
00:00:13,600 --> 00:00:18,240
What made Monckton's response interesting is that it wasn't really a rebuttal at all,

5
00:00:18,240 --> 00:00:22,000
but for the most part an astonishing climb down in his position,

6
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:24,400
and even outright denial of what he said.

7
00:00:24,800 --> 00:00:28,560
Once again, this needs very little comment from me because

8
00:00:28,560 --> 00:00:32,400
Monckton is extremely good at debunking himself. Just watch.

9
00:00:33,360 --> 00:00:37,200
First up, the claim that Monckton was Margaret Thatcher's science advisor.

10
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:41,840
I did advise Margaret Thatcher on many scientific and other matters, including climate change.

11
00:00:42,640 --> 00:00:48,160
He may well have done, who knows, but that doesn't make him Margaret Thatcher's science advisor,

12
00:00:48,160 --> 00:00:51,120
and that's the claim that's being made by his supporters.

13
00:00:51,760 --> 00:00:56,320
I refuted Monckton's claim that he'd written a peer-reviewed paper, and he responded,

14
00:00:56,320 --> 00:00:58,800
As was usual for Physics and Society at the time,

15
00:00:58,800 --> 00:01:03,040
the journal's review editor, Professor Alvin Saperstein, reviewed the paper.

16
00:01:03,680 --> 00:01:09,200
But that's routine editing, Mr Monckton, which every submission to the newsletter goes through.

17
00:01:09,200 --> 00:01:11,680
It's not the same as peer review.

18
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:15,280
Physics and Society itself says it's not a peer-reviewed journal.

19
00:01:15,280 --> 00:01:20,080
It's a forum for letters, commentary, book reviews, and non-peer-reviewed articles.

20
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:24,160
Surely anyone who understands scientific publishing knows the difference.

21
00:01:24,720 --> 00:01:26,960
So my rebuttal of your claim is correct.

22
00:01:27,680 --> 00:01:30,560
What about Monckton's claim that the Earth has been cooling?

23
00:01:30,560 --> 00:01:36,800
In 2008, I said the Earth had been cooling since the turn of the millennium on 1st of January 2001.

24
00:01:36,800 --> 00:01:38,400
So it had at that time.

25
00:01:38,960 --> 00:01:41,600
Do the linear regression for yourself and see.

26
00:01:41,600 --> 00:01:46,400
Recent warming, however, means that there's been little change in temperature since 2001.

27
00:01:46,960 --> 00:01:49,440
No need to tell us what you said, Mr Monckton.

28
00:01:49,440 --> 00:01:51,120
Here's what you actually said.

29
00:01:51,120 --> 00:01:55,280
And what that looks to me like is a fairly hefty, and indeed it is,

30
00:01:55,840 --> 00:01:58,560
statistically significant rate of fall.

31
00:01:58,560 --> 00:02:02,800
But of course, cherry-picking start and end points over such a short period of time

32
00:02:02,800 --> 00:02:06,000
is not any kind of guide to long-term temperature change.

33
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:10,640
In statistical parlance, any temperature decline you might have cherry-picked from the graph

34
00:02:10,640 --> 00:02:12,720
is not statistically significant.

35
00:02:13,280 --> 00:02:15,440
Of course, Monckton claimed that it was.

36
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:19,280
Statistically significant rate of fall.

37
00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:21,280
But here's someone who contradicts him.

38
00:02:21,920 --> 00:02:25,200
There has been a fall trend in temperatures.

39
00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:29,520
It's not at present a statistically significant fall.

40
00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:31,280
Who's the mystery rebutter?

41
00:02:31,280 --> 00:02:32,880
Why, it's Monckton himself.

42
00:02:33,760 --> 00:02:36,160
This is what I'll call the Monckton manoeuvre,

43
00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:41,520
a subtle change in position whenever he gets caught out or realises he's made a mistake.

44
00:02:41,520 --> 00:02:43,680
I'll let the two Moncktons argue about whether

45
00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:46,880
Monckton's trend is statistically significant or not.

46
00:02:46,880 --> 00:02:51,440
As we saw in my video, real climate scientists all agree that the trend is up,

47
00:02:51,440 --> 00:02:54,400
and Monckton can't show where their analysis is wrong.

48
00:02:55,600 --> 00:02:58,080
On overall melting of the Greenland ice cap,

49
00:02:58,080 --> 00:03:03,360
Johannesson et al, whom I cited, reported a substantial net accumulation of snow,

50
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:06,880
fern and ice on Greenland from 1992 to 2003.

51
00:03:07,760 --> 00:03:09,760
As I said, no he didn't.

52
00:03:09,760 --> 00:03:12,560
Here, Monckton is simply repeating his claim,

53
00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:16,240
even though I showed Johannesson's paper, which Monckton cites,

54
00:03:16,240 --> 00:03:19,440
showing the complete opposite to what Monckton claims.

55
00:03:19,440 --> 00:03:21,440
How much clearer can that be?

56
00:03:21,440 --> 00:03:23,840
But Monckton simply repeats the claim as if

57
00:03:23,840 --> 00:03:27,600
repeating it will magically make the paper change its text.

58
00:03:27,600 --> 00:03:30,800
But if Monckton ever does get around to realising his mistake

59
00:03:30,800 --> 00:03:33,520
by checking Johannesson's paper more closely,

60
00:03:33,520 --> 00:03:35,920
watch out for the next Monckton manoeuvre.

61
00:03:35,920 --> 00:03:39,680
My bet is he'll quietly eliminate the word net from his claim.

62
00:03:40,320 --> 00:03:43,520
As for no systematic loss of ice in the Arctic,

63
00:03:43,520 --> 00:03:46,240
well, before I show Monckton's response to this one,

64
00:03:46,240 --> 00:03:48,560
let's just listen again to what he said.

65
00:03:49,200 --> 00:03:55,440
So we're not looking at a sort of long-term systematic loss of ice in the Arctic.

66
00:03:55,440 --> 00:03:59,440
As always, the best person to contradict this claim is Monckton himself.

67
00:03:59,440 --> 00:04:02,480
Look for the Monckton manoeuvre buried inside his response.

68
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:07,280
Arctic ice has certainly declined ever since the satellites have been watching.

69
00:04:08,240 --> 00:04:09,760
Yes, exactly.

70
00:04:09,760 --> 00:04:14,000
So there is a long-term systematic loss of ice in the Arctic,

71
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:18,320
which is exactly what glaciologists and climatologists have been saying

72
00:04:18,320 --> 00:04:20,720
and which Monckton previously denied.

73
00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:26,800
So we're not looking at a sort of long-term systematic loss of ice in the Arctic.

74
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:30,480
Next, Monckton's claim that there's no correlation between

75
00:04:30,480 --> 00:04:33,360
CO2 and temperatures over the past 500 million years.

76
00:04:33,920 --> 00:04:34,880
Monckton responds,

77
00:04:35,440 --> 00:04:38,320
there has indeed been a remarkable correlation between

78
00:04:38,320 --> 00:04:42,400
CO2 and temperatures over the past 500 million years.

79
00:04:42,400 --> 00:04:42,900
What?

80
00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:47,360
You've been arguing all along that there was no correlation.

81
00:04:47,360 --> 00:04:49,440
Oh, it's another Monckton manoeuvre.

82
00:04:49,440 --> 00:04:55,040
So let's just go back to what you told your audiences repeatedly just a couple of years ago.

83
00:04:55,040 --> 00:05:00,320
Here we get a rather prodigious mismatch again between CO2 concentration,

84
00:05:00,320 --> 00:05:04,560
which is the black line, and temperature concentration, which is the blue line,

85
00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:07,120
going right back to almost 600,000 years into the past.

86
00:05:07,120 --> 00:05:11,200
Controversial is that again it doesn't show a terribly good link between the two.

87
00:05:11,200 --> 00:05:14,960
And look at how little correlation there is in that graph between

88
00:05:14,960 --> 00:05:19,440
temperature in blue there and CO2 concentration in black.

89
00:05:19,440 --> 00:05:24,800
Now Monckton quietly drops that claim altogether and brazenly tells us the complete opposite.

90
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:30,400
Next, a pre-Cambrian ice planet shows that CO2 has no effect on the climate.

91
00:05:31,040 --> 00:05:34,560
Okay, Monckton goes into a rather long and boring dissertation on this,

92
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:36,480
but here's the main point.

93
00:05:37,040 --> 00:05:40,400
The reasonable point that I made quoting Professor Ian Plimer,

94
00:05:40,400 --> 00:05:43,520
a geologist who has made a particular study of the period,

95
00:05:43,520 --> 00:05:49,200
was that even allowing for the fact that the sun was 5% fainter in the neo-proterozoic than today,

96
00:05:49,200 --> 00:05:52,800
and for the fact that the planet's albedo was much greater than now,

97
00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:56,240
equatorial sea level glaciers could not have come and gone twice if

98
00:05:56,240 --> 00:06:00,480
CO2 had had the very large warming effect that is now imagined.

99
00:06:00,480 --> 00:06:05,600
Monckton ignores real research, which I cited, showing that carbon dioxide played

100
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:09,040
a crucial role in unlocking the earth from a global glaciation.

101
00:06:09,840 --> 00:06:14,560
The question I asked in my video was if the earth was effectively deep frozen

102
00:06:14,560 --> 00:06:19,440
with glaciers at the equator and a much weaker sun, as Monckton agrees,

103
00:06:20,080 --> 00:06:23,920
and a high albedo that reflected most of the solar energy it did receive,

104
00:06:24,480 --> 00:06:28,160
how did the earth emerge from this condition and turn into a hot house,

105
00:06:28,160 --> 00:06:30,880
not just once, but perhaps two or three times?

106
00:06:31,440 --> 00:06:33,840
Monckton doesn't even try to answer this question,

107
00:06:33,840 --> 00:06:38,480
he simply repeats his belief that CO2 could not have unfrozen the earth,

108
00:06:38,480 --> 00:06:40,880
but he gives no explanation for that belief.

109
00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:45,680
He says there's been no change in Himalayan glaciers for 200 years, there has.

110
00:06:45,680 --> 00:06:47,760
Let's just see where this claim comes from.

111
00:06:48,480 --> 00:06:50,080
They're doing fine, by the way.

112
00:06:50,080 --> 00:06:53,520
He's got 200 years of records from the days of the Raj,

113
00:06:53,520 --> 00:06:56,160
when we first began monitoring these things, dead should know.

114
00:06:56,960 --> 00:07:00,720
And the glaciers are showing no particular change in 200 years.

115
00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:04,800
The only glacier that's declined a little is Gangotri, very famous glacier,

116
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:07,440
because there's been local geological instability,

117
00:07:07,440 --> 00:07:10,000
nothing to do with global warming, all the others are doing fine.

118
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:12,880
Well, in the rebuttal, Monckton says something slightly different.

119
00:07:13,760 --> 00:07:17,600
The pattern of advance and retreat of the glaciers is as much as it has been

120
00:07:17,600 --> 00:07:21,520
over the past 200 years since the Raj first kept records,

121
00:07:21,520 --> 00:07:24,560
but that's not what Monckton told his audiences.

122
00:07:24,560 --> 00:07:28,240
He told them only one glacier had retreated, a little.

123
00:07:29,040 --> 00:07:32,800
Astonishingly, Monckton has already done one Monckton manoeuvre on this

124
00:07:32,800 --> 00:07:34,880
when I questioned him about his sources,

125
00:07:34,880 --> 00:07:38,160
and he came up with the fact that Himalayan glaciers have been receding

126
00:07:38,160 --> 00:07:39,520
since the 19th century.

127
00:07:40,080 --> 00:07:42,560
Which of the three versions do you want to believe?

128
00:07:42,560 --> 00:07:44,800
Well, I'm not inclined to believe any of them,

129
00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:49,040
because this isn't a matter of belief, but of properly conducted studies,

130
00:07:49,040 --> 00:07:51,840
and nowhere does Monckton cite a single study,

131
00:07:51,840 --> 00:07:55,040
except reference to his exchanges with Professor Batt,

132
00:07:55,040 --> 00:07:59,520
the man he claims is responsible for monitoring Himalayan glaciers.

133
00:07:59,520 --> 00:08:01,680
But Monckton doesn't rebut my revelation

134
00:08:01,680 --> 00:08:05,920
that Batt is not the person responsible for monitoring Himalayan glaciers.

135
00:08:05,920 --> 00:08:06,960
How do I know?

136
00:08:06,960 --> 00:08:09,280
Because Batt himself says so.

137
00:08:09,840 --> 00:08:11,760
What's Monckton's answer to this?

138
00:08:11,760 --> 00:08:12,480
None at all.

139
00:08:13,440 --> 00:08:15,840
And that takes us very neatly on to the next claim,

140
00:08:16,560 --> 00:08:19,760
which was that only one Himalayan glacier was retreating.

141
00:08:21,200 --> 00:08:24,000
Of course, now there's a Monckton manoeuvre on this.

142
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:27,760
He now goes on to admit that many other glaciers are receding.

143
00:08:29,040 --> 00:08:32,400
And he says, merely because I mentioned one glacier as receding,

144
00:08:32,400 --> 00:08:35,600
it is not legitimate to infer that I said or implied

145
00:08:35,600 --> 00:08:38,000
that only one glacier was receding.

146
00:08:38,560 --> 00:08:41,040
The only glacier that's declined a little is Gangotri.

147
00:08:41,040 --> 00:08:43,440
But I'm not inferring it, Mr Monckton.

148
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:45,440
You said it quite clearly.

149
00:08:45,440 --> 00:08:48,000
The only glacier that's declined a little is Gangotri.

150
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:50,640
If you can't even stand by your original claim,

151
00:08:50,640 --> 00:08:55,200
but exercise another slippery Monckton manoeuvre to deny you ever said it,

152
00:08:55,200 --> 00:08:57,840
then I guess the first Mr Monckton was wrong,

153
00:08:57,840 --> 00:09:00,000
and my rebuttal of him is correct.

154
00:09:00,720 --> 00:09:05,520
Now Monckton's claim that CO2 forcing is 1.135 watts per square metre.

155
00:09:05,520 --> 00:09:06,560
Here's his response.

156
00:09:07,120 --> 00:09:09,600
A finding of low climate sensitivity in Linsen

157
00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:12,480
suggests that the warming exercised by CO2

158
00:09:12,480 --> 00:09:17,520
is equivalent to assuming a forcing of 1.135 watts per square metre.

159
00:09:18,160 --> 00:09:23,040
Again, never mind what you think you said or what you meant to say, Mr Monckton.

160
00:09:23,040 --> 00:09:26,400
Here's what you actually wrote in your APS opinion piece.

161
00:09:26,960 --> 00:09:31,840
Forcing approximately equals 1.135 watts per square metre.

162
00:09:32,880 --> 00:09:37,040
I know, let's make it go away for a second and see if it changes into something else.

163
00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:41,280
Nope, he really did write that.

164
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:46,880
And to substantiate the rest of my statement, climatologists, even the sceptics,

165
00:09:46,880 --> 00:09:50,800
all agree that the figure is in fact around three times higher.

166
00:09:50,800 --> 00:09:55,280
Even Linsen, whose paper Monckton cites, puts the figure three times higher.

167
00:09:56,240 --> 00:09:59,840
So I don't know what else I have to do to show that my claim is correct.

168
00:10:00,720 --> 00:10:04,880
Now of course various factors might make it appear that forcing is less,

169
00:10:04,880 --> 00:10:09,360
but that's called sensitivity, which is something completely different.

170
00:10:09,360 --> 00:10:14,160
And that brings us on to the next Monckton error, that he confused forcing with sensitivity.

171
00:10:14,800 --> 00:10:19,600
I gave an explanation of forcing and sensitivity in one of my Monckton Buncombe videos.

172
00:10:19,600 --> 00:10:23,440
If you open all the windows on a cold night, it might appear that the output

173
00:10:23,440 --> 00:10:26,720
of a heater has been reduced, but that's an illusion.

174
00:10:26,720 --> 00:10:29,840
The heater's still pumping out the same amount of heat.

175
00:10:29,840 --> 00:10:34,480
It's how the house responds to that heat source that decides the ultimate temperature.

176
00:10:35,200 --> 00:10:37,600
It's summed up in this very well-known equation.

177
00:10:38,160 --> 00:10:42,480
If Monckton for some reason thinks the earth is not responding to a CO2 increase

178
00:10:42,480 --> 00:10:48,720
in the way most climatologists conclude, what he should have done is reduce sensitivity by three.

179
00:10:49,760 --> 00:10:54,960
Nowhere in his what's up with that response does Monckton deny he mixed the two up.

180
00:10:54,960 --> 00:10:58,160
He just makes the most astonishing excuse for it,

181
00:10:58,160 --> 00:11:03,840
which is that it doesn't matter which you divide by three, it comes out to the same answer anyway.

182
00:11:04,800 --> 00:11:09,840
But even this excuse is belied by Monckton's belated attempts to cover up his mistake.

183
00:11:10,400 --> 00:11:16,560
In his opinion piece for the APS newsletter, he tells us quite clearly he divided forcing by three.

184
00:11:17,600 --> 00:11:21,680
But later he obviously realised his mistake, and in a response to critics,

185
00:11:21,680 --> 00:11:24,800
tried to pretend he'd divided sensitivity by three.

186
00:11:25,680 --> 00:11:29,440
This quiet reversal of position is the closest you'll ever get

187
00:11:29,440 --> 00:11:32,240
to an admission from Monckton that he made a mistake.

188
00:11:32,480 --> 00:11:37,600
He says a leading climate researcher found a loss of cloud cover is responsible for recent warming.

189
00:11:37,600 --> 00:11:39,520
She says it shows no such thing.

190
00:11:40,080 --> 00:11:44,800
Actually, what I showed in my video were three instances of Monckton citing a paper by Rachel

191
00:11:44,800 --> 00:11:50,480
Pinker and claiming that it demonstrated decreased cloud cover was responsible for recent warming.

192
00:11:51,040 --> 00:11:56,320
And I showed a statement from Dr Pinker explaining that her paper didn't demonstrate this at all,

193
00:11:56,320 --> 00:11:57,520
and that Monckton was wrong.

194
00:11:58,160 --> 00:11:59,520
What's Monckton's rebuttal?

195
00:12:00,080 --> 00:12:02,800
OK, there is a bit of a Monckton manoeuvre here.

196
00:12:02,800 --> 00:12:06,240
He no longer asserts that warming is due to decreased cloud cover.

197
00:12:06,240 --> 00:12:10,720
It's now just a hypothesis, and it doesn't come from Dr Pinker or the paper.

198
00:12:10,720 --> 00:12:13,920
It comes from Monckton's interpretation of her paper.

199
00:12:13,920 --> 00:12:15,120
So who's right?

200
00:12:15,840 --> 00:12:21,200
Now, before anyone starts thinking that maybe Dr Pinker, despite 30 years as a researcher,

201
00:12:21,200 --> 00:12:24,000
is not very bright and might have made a mistake,

202
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:28,080
let me just get a character reference from someone who may be familiar to you.

203
00:12:28,800 --> 00:12:31,520
He is wholly unconcerned with the global warming debate.

204
00:12:31,520 --> 00:12:33,280
It's as though he lives on another planet.

205
00:12:33,280 --> 00:12:36,240
He lives for verifying whether satellites are doing their job.

206
00:12:36,240 --> 00:12:38,080
That's what Pinker is all about.

207
00:12:38,080 --> 00:12:40,800
Then my rebuttal of his claim obviously stands.

208
00:12:40,800 --> 00:12:44,000
Dr Pinker does indeed say that Monckton is wrong.

209
00:12:44,640 --> 00:12:48,720
Now, I never said Monckton misquoted scientists to mislead his audience,

210
00:12:48,720 --> 00:12:52,400
but I did show how he changed quotes in order to support his arguments.

211
00:12:53,040 --> 00:12:54,320
Monckton responds,

212
00:12:54,320 --> 00:12:57,920
No instances are given to support this libel, so I cannot comment.

213
00:12:58,560 --> 00:13:01,840
But of course instances are given very clearly.

214
00:13:01,840 --> 00:13:04,400
What you'll read next are the actual quotes,

215
00:13:04,400 --> 00:13:07,600
and what you'll hear are Mr Monckton's misquotes.

216
00:13:07,600 --> 00:13:10,560
There has been no global warming for a decade.

217
00:13:10,560 --> 00:13:12,080
We cannot explain why.

218
00:13:12,640 --> 00:13:15,200
It is a travesty that we can't.

219
00:13:15,200 --> 00:13:15,760
And he said,

220
00:13:16,640 --> 00:13:21,840
The Argeddon scenario that he depicts is not based on any scientific view.

221
00:13:22,560 --> 00:13:27,680
Unless we announce disasters, no one will listen.

222
00:13:28,640 --> 00:13:30,800
If Mr Monckton thinks I'm being libelous

223
00:13:30,800 --> 00:13:34,480
by showing him publicly giving altered versions of these quotes,

224
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:38,960
great, sue me, and I'll be happy to produce all of this evidence in court.

225
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:43,920
Monckton said planets with a high albedo are cooler than planets with a low albedo.

226
00:13:43,920 --> 00:13:47,600
Now, Monckton starts off his response with the carefully chosen words,

227
00:13:47,600 --> 00:13:50,240
If all other parameters be held constant.

228
00:13:51,120 --> 00:13:54,960
Now, this is correct, but Monckton didn't tell his audiences that.

229
00:13:54,960 --> 00:13:57,520
He didn't tell them that in order to make this conclusion,

230
00:13:57,520 --> 00:13:59,920
one has to strip away a planet's atmosphere.

231
00:14:00,480 --> 00:14:04,320
So a planet with an atmosphere is going to behave completely differently,

232
00:14:04,320 --> 00:14:07,040
and our planet does have an atmosphere.

233
00:14:07,040 --> 00:14:09,440
So what he told the audience was wrong.

234
00:14:10,400 --> 00:14:13,920
Then by using the Monckton manoeuvre to add the unassuming phrase,

235
00:14:13,920 --> 00:14:16,480
If all other parameters be held constant,

236
00:14:16,480 --> 00:14:18,560
Monckton accepts that what he said was wrong.

237
00:14:19,440 --> 00:14:22,400
Monckton gets information in peer-reviewed science papers wrong,

238
00:14:22,400 --> 00:14:23,360
and he responds,

239
00:14:23,360 --> 00:14:26,480
Not a single instance is cited. This is pure yah-boo.

240
00:14:27,120 --> 00:14:29,760
Of course an instance is cited, Mr Monckton.

241
00:14:29,760 --> 00:14:31,760
Several instances are cited.

242
00:14:31,760 --> 00:14:35,280
I cited your misquote of a paper by Scafetta and West,

243
00:14:35,280 --> 00:14:39,920
and of course I cited Johansson, and a paper by Sami Solanki et al.

244
00:14:39,920 --> 00:14:43,360
He says some planets are warming because of the sun. No, they're not.

245
00:14:43,360 --> 00:14:46,400
Again, I didn't write this. Someone put this on the forum,

246
00:14:46,400 --> 00:14:49,040
and it isn't really even a paraphrase of what I said,

247
00:14:49,040 --> 00:14:51,280
but Monckton's response is interesting anyway.

248
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:56,560
There has indeed been evidence of simultaneous warming in many planets of the solar system,

249
00:14:56,560 --> 00:14:59,120
and I have mentioned this. Well, that's true.

250
00:14:59,120 --> 00:15:02,000
However, given the difficulties of reliable measurement and imaging,

251
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:07,280
I have not sought to draw definitive conclusions about the role of the sun in global warming

252
00:15:07,280 --> 00:15:09,520
from such observations. Really?

253
00:15:10,240 --> 00:15:13,920
At the moment the polar ice caps of Mars are melting,

254
00:15:13,920 --> 00:15:17,760
there has been warming noticed on the surface of Jupiter,

255
00:15:17,760 --> 00:15:23,360
on one of the moons of Neptune, even on far distant Pluto, all at the same time.

256
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:28,560
And why is this? Because astronauts are taking their 4x4s up into space?

257
00:15:28,560 --> 00:15:33,920
No. It's because the sun, as we'll see, has been remarkably active.

258
00:15:34,720 --> 00:15:38,480
I can't add to this except to say, another Monckton manoeuvre.

259
00:15:38,480 --> 00:15:42,480
Monckton is now completely denying something he said in front of audiences,

260
00:15:42,480 --> 00:15:45,040
and even filmed for distribution.

261
00:15:45,040 --> 00:15:48,880
He said that the International Astronomical Union has declared the sun is responsible

262
00:15:48,880 --> 00:15:50,720
for the recent warming. It didn't.

263
00:15:50,720 --> 00:15:55,280
And Monckton responds, I cited a paper given by Dr Habibulu Atusomatov

264
00:15:55,280 --> 00:15:59,200
at the 2004 symposium of the IAU in St Petersburg, Florida,

265
00:15:59,200 --> 00:16:03,200
but put IAU at the foot of the slide, rather than Dr Atusomatov's name.

266
00:16:03,840 --> 00:16:08,080
Well, I'd say that was a mistake, because Dr Atusomatov

267
00:16:08,080 --> 00:16:11,200
is clearly not the International Astronomical Union.

268
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:16,800
And Monckton seems to make a habit of replacing the name Dr Atusomatov

269
00:16:16,800 --> 00:16:19,280
for the International Astronomical Union.

270
00:16:19,840 --> 00:16:23,760
Now, to slip up on a name once is perhaps understandable.

271
00:16:23,760 --> 00:16:26,240
To continue to do it is astonishing.

272
00:16:26,240 --> 00:16:30,480
Most solar physicists agree the International Astronomical Union in 2004 had a symposium on it.

273
00:16:30,480 --> 00:16:31,760
They concluded that that was the case.

274
00:16:31,760 --> 00:16:33,840
And this is not my conclusion, this is the conclusion of

275
00:16:33,840 --> 00:16:37,520
the International Astronomical Union symposium in 2004.

276
00:16:37,520 --> 00:16:38,640
This is what they said.

277
00:16:38,640 --> 00:16:41,120
Sun caused today's warming, today's warming is normal.

278
00:16:41,120 --> 00:16:43,120
Well, that covers all the responses.

279
00:16:43,120 --> 00:16:46,560
I'll have to put my conclusions in the second part of this video.
