00:00.000 --> 00:04.880
It seems Christopher Monckton has responded to my video series about him, sort of.

00:04.880 --> 00:09.520
On the website What's Up With That, he replied not directly to the videos,

00:09.520 --> 00:12.400
but to a loose summary of them that someone had posted.

00:13.600 --> 00:18.240
What made Monckton's response interesting is that it wasn't really a rebuttal at all,

00:18.240 --> 00:22.000
but for the most part an astonishing climb down in his position,

00:22.000 --> 00:24.400
and even outright denial of what he said.

00:24.800 --> 00:28.560
Once again, this needs very little comment from me because

00:28.560 --> 00:32.400
Monckton is extremely good at debunking himself. Just watch.

00:33.360 --> 00:37.200
First up, the claim that Monckton was Margaret Thatcher's science advisor.

00:37.200 --> 00:41.840
I did advise Margaret Thatcher on many scientific and other matters, including climate change.

00:42.640 --> 00:48.160
He may well have done, who knows, but that doesn't make him Margaret Thatcher's science advisor,

00:48.160 --> 00:51.120
and that's the claim that's being made by his supporters.

00:51.760 --> 00:56.320
I refuted Monckton's claim that he'd written a peer-reviewed paper, and he responded,

00:56.320 --> 00:58.800
As was usual for Physics and Society at the time,

00:58.800 --> 01:03.040
the journal's review editor, Professor Alvin Saperstein, reviewed the paper.

01:03.680 --> 01:09.200
But that's routine editing, Mr Monckton, which every submission to the newsletter goes through.

01:09.200 --> 01:11.680
It's not the same as peer review.

01:11.680 --> 01:15.280
Physics and Society itself says it's not a peer-reviewed journal.

01:15.280 --> 01:20.080
It's a forum for letters, commentary, book reviews, and non-peer-reviewed articles.

01:20.640 --> 01:24.160
Surely anyone who understands scientific publishing knows the difference.

01:24.720 --> 01:26.960
So my rebuttal of your claim is correct.

01:27.680 --> 01:30.560
What about Monckton's claim that the Earth has been cooling?

01:30.560 --> 01:36.800
In 2008, I said the Earth had been cooling since the turn of the millennium on 1st of January 2001.

01:36.800 --> 01:38.400
So it had at that time.

01:38.960 --> 01:41.600
Do the linear regression for yourself and see.

01:41.600 --> 01:46.400
Recent warming, however, means that there's been little change in temperature since 2001.

01:46.960 --> 01:49.440
No need to tell us what you said, Mr Monckton.

01:49.440 --> 01:51.120
Here's what you actually said.

01:51.120 --> 01:55.280
And what that looks to me like is a fairly hefty, and indeed it is,

01:55.840 --> 01:58.560
statistically significant rate of fall.

01:58.560 --> 02:02.800
But of course, cherry-picking start and end points over such a short period of time

02:02.800 --> 02:06.000
is not any kind of guide to long-term temperature change.

02:06.000 --> 02:10.640
In statistical parlance, any temperature decline you might have cherry-picked from the graph

02:10.640 --> 02:12.720
is not statistically significant.

02:13.280 --> 02:15.440
Of course, Monckton claimed that it was.

02:16.000 --> 02:19.280
Statistically significant rate of fall.

02:19.280 --> 02:21.280
But here's someone who contradicts him.

02:21.920 --> 02:25.200
There has been a fall trend in temperatures.

02:25.200 --> 02:29.520
It's not at present a statistically significant fall.

02:29.520 --> 02:31.280
Who's the mystery rebutter?

02:31.280 --> 02:32.880
Why, it's Monckton himself.

02:33.760 --> 02:36.160
This is what I'll call the Monckton manoeuvre,

02:36.160 --> 02:41.520
a subtle change in position whenever he gets caught out or realises he's made a mistake.

02:41.520 --> 02:43.680
I'll let the two Moncktons argue about whether

02:43.680 --> 02:46.880
Monckton's trend is statistically significant or not.

02:46.880 --> 02:51.440
As we saw in my video, real climate scientists all agree that the trend is up,

02:51.440 --> 02:54.400
and Monckton can't show where their analysis is wrong.

02:55.600 --> 02:58.080
On overall melting of the Greenland ice cap,

02:58.080 --> 03:03.360
Johannesson et al, whom I cited, reported a substantial net accumulation of snow,

03:03.360 --> 03:06.880
fern and ice on Greenland from 1992 to 2003.

03:07.760 --> 03:09.760
As I said, no he didn't.

03:09.760 --> 03:12.560
Here, Monckton is simply repeating his claim,

03:12.560 --> 03:16.240
even though I showed Johannesson's paper, which Monckton cites,

03:16.240 --> 03:19.440
showing the complete opposite to what Monckton claims.

03:19.440 --> 03:21.440
How much clearer can that be?

03:21.440 --> 03:23.840
But Monckton simply repeats the claim as if

03:23.840 --> 03:27.600
repeating it will magically make the paper change its text.

03:27.600 --> 03:30.800
But if Monckton ever does get around to realising his mistake

03:30.800 --> 03:33.520
by checking Johannesson's paper more closely,

03:33.520 --> 03:35.920
watch out for the next Monckton manoeuvre.

03:35.920 --> 03:39.680
My bet is he'll quietly eliminate the word net from his claim.

03:40.320 --> 03:43.520
As for no systematic loss of ice in the Arctic,

03:43.520 --> 03:46.240
well, before I show Monckton's response to this one,

03:46.240 --> 03:48.560
let's just listen again to what he said.

03:49.200 --> 03:55.440
So we're not looking at a sort of long-term systematic loss of ice in the Arctic.

03:55.440 --> 03:59.440
As always, the best person to contradict this claim is Monckton himself.

03:59.440 --> 04:02.480
Look for the Monckton manoeuvre buried inside his response.

04:03.200 --> 04:07.280
Arctic ice has certainly declined ever since the satellites have been watching.

04:08.240 --> 04:09.760
Yes, exactly.

04:09.760 --> 04:14.000
So there is a long-term systematic loss of ice in the Arctic,

04:14.000 --> 04:18.320
which is exactly what glaciologists and climatologists have been saying

04:18.320 --> 04:20.720
and which Monckton previously denied.

04:20.720 --> 04:26.800
So we're not looking at a sort of long-term systematic loss of ice in the Arctic.

04:27.600 --> 04:30.480
Next, Monckton's claim that there's no correlation between

04:30.480 --> 04:33.360
CO2 and temperatures over the past 500 million years.

04:33.920 --> 04:34.880
Monckton responds,

04:35.440 --> 04:38.320
there has indeed been a remarkable correlation between

04:38.320 --> 04:42.400
CO2 and temperatures over the past 500 million years.

04:42.400 --> 04:42.900
What?

04:43.680 --> 04:47.360
You've been arguing all along that there was no correlation.

04:47.360 --> 04:49.440
Oh, it's another Monckton manoeuvre.

04:49.440 --> 04:55.040
So let's just go back to what you told your audiences repeatedly just a couple of years ago.

04:55.040 --> 05:00.320
Here we get a rather prodigious mismatch again between CO2 concentration,

05:00.320 --> 05:04.560
which is the black line, and temperature concentration, which is the blue line,

05:04.560 --> 05:07.120
going right back to almost 600,000 years into the past.

05:07.120 --> 05:11.200
Controversial is that again it doesn't show a terribly good link between the two.

05:11.200 --> 05:14.960
And look at how little correlation there is in that graph between

05:14.960 --> 05:19.440
temperature in blue there and CO2 concentration in black.

05:19.440 --> 05:24.800
Now Monckton quietly drops that claim altogether and brazenly tells us the complete opposite.

05:26.000 --> 05:30.400
Next, a pre-Cambrian ice planet shows that CO2 has no effect on the climate.

05:31.040 --> 05:34.560
Okay, Monckton goes into a rather long and boring dissertation on this,

05:34.560 --> 05:36.480
but here's the main point.

05:37.040 --> 05:40.400
The reasonable point that I made quoting Professor Ian Plimer,

05:40.400 --> 05:43.520
a geologist who has made a particular study of the period,

05:43.520 --> 05:49.200
was that even allowing for the fact that the sun was 5% fainter in the neo-proterozoic than today,

05:49.200 --> 05:52.800
and for the fact that the planet's albedo was much greater than now,

05:52.800 --> 05:56.240
equatorial sea level glaciers could not have come and gone twice if

05:56.240 --> 06:00.480
CO2 had had the very large warming effect that is now imagined.

06:00.480 --> 06:05.600
Monckton ignores real research, which I cited, showing that carbon dioxide played

06:05.600 --> 06:09.040
a crucial role in unlocking the earth from a global glaciation.

06:09.840 --> 06:14.560
The question I asked in my video was if the earth was effectively deep frozen

06:14.560 --> 06:19.440
with glaciers at the equator and a much weaker sun, as Monckton agrees,

06:20.080 --> 06:23.920
and a high albedo that reflected most of the solar energy it did receive,

06:24.480 --> 06:28.160
how did the earth emerge from this condition and turn into a hot house,

06:28.160 --> 06:30.880
not just once, but perhaps two or three times?

06:31.440 --> 06:33.840
Monckton doesn't even try to answer this question,

06:33.840 --> 06:38.480
he simply repeats his belief that CO2 could not have unfrozen the earth,

06:38.480 --> 06:40.880
but he gives no explanation for that belief.

06:41.600 --> 06:45.680
He says there's been no change in Himalayan glaciers for 200 years, there has.

06:45.680 --> 06:47.760
Let's just see where this claim comes from.

06:48.480 --> 06:50.080
They're doing fine, by the way.

06:50.080 --> 06:53.520
He's got 200 years of records from the days of the Raj,

06:53.520 --> 06:56.160
when we first began monitoring these things, dead should know.

06:56.960 --> 07:00.720
And the glaciers are showing no particular change in 200 years.

07:00.720 --> 07:04.800
The only glacier that's declined a little is Gangotri, very famous glacier,

07:04.800 --> 07:07.440
because there's been local geological instability,

07:07.440 --> 07:10.000
nothing to do with global warming, all the others are doing fine.

07:10.000 --> 07:12.880
Well, in the rebuttal, Monckton says something slightly different.

07:13.760 --> 07:17.600
The pattern of advance and retreat of the glaciers is as much as it has been

07:17.600 --> 07:21.520
over the past 200 years since the Raj first kept records,

07:21.520 --> 07:24.560
but that's not what Monckton told his audiences.

07:24.560 --> 07:28.240
He told them only one glacier had retreated, a little.

07:29.040 --> 07:32.800
Astonishingly, Monckton has already done one Monckton manoeuvre on this

07:32.800 --> 07:34.880
when I questioned him about his sources,

07:34.880 --> 07:38.160
and he came up with the fact that Himalayan glaciers have been receding

07:38.160 --> 07:39.520
since the 19th century.

07:40.080 --> 07:42.560
Which of the three versions do you want to believe?

07:42.560 --> 07:44.800
Well, I'm not inclined to believe any of them,

07:44.800 --> 07:49.040
because this isn't a matter of belief, but of properly conducted studies,

07:49.040 --> 07:51.840
and nowhere does Monckton cite a single study,

07:51.840 --> 07:55.040
except reference to his exchanges with Professor Batt,

07:55.040 --> 07:59.520
the man he claims is responsible for monitoring Himalayan glaciers.

07:59.520 --> 08:01.680
But Monckton doesn't rebut my revelation

08:01.680 --> 08:05.920
that Batt is not the person responsible for monitoring Himalayan glaciers.

08:05.920 --> 08:06.960
How do I know?

08:06.960 --> 08:09.280
Because Batt himself says so.

08:09.840 --> 08:11.760
What's Monckton's answer to this?

08:11.760 --> 08:12.480
None at all.

08:13.440 --> 08:15.840
And that takes us very neatly on to the next claim,

08:16.560 --> 08:19.760
which was that only one Himalayan glacier was retreating.

08:21.200 --> 08:24.000
Of course, now there's a Monckton manoeuvre on this.

08:24.000 --> 08:27.760
He now goes on to admit that many other glaciers are receding.

08:29.040 --> 08:32.400
And he says, merely because I mentioned one glacier as receding,

08:32.400 --> 08:35.600
it is not legitimate to infer that I said or implied

08:35.600 --> 08:38.000
that only one glacier was receding.

08:38.560 --> 08:41.040
The only glacier that's declined a little is Gangotri.

08:41.040 --> 08:43.440
But I'm not inferring it, Mr Monckton.

08:43.440 --> 08:45.440
You said it quite clearly.

08:45.440 --> 08:48.000
The only glacier that's declined a little is Gangotri.

08:48.000 --> 08:50.640
If you can't even stand by your original claim,

08:50.640 --> 08:55.200
but exercise another slippery Monckton manoeuvre to deny you ever said it,

08:55.200 --> 08:57.840
then I guess the first Mr Monckton was wrong,

08:57.840 --> 09:00.000
and my rebuttal of him is correct.

09:00.720 --> 09:05.520
Now Monckton's claim that CO2 forcing is 1.135 watts per square metre.

09:05.520 --> 09:06.560
Here's his response.

09:07.120 --> 09:09.600
A finding of low climate sensitivity in Linsen

09:09.600 --> 09:12.480
suggests that the warming exercised by CO2

09:12.480 --> 09:17.520
is equivalent to assuming a forcing of 1.135 watts per square metre.

09:18.160 --> 09:23.040
Again, never mind what you think you said or what you meant to say, Mr Monckton.

09:23.040 --> 09:26.400
Here's what you actually wrote in your APS opinion piece.

09:26.960 --> 09:31.840
Forcing approximately equals 1.135 watts per square metre.

09:32.880 --> 09:37.040
I know, let's make it go away for a second and see if it changes into something else.

09:39.600 --> 09:41.280
Nope, he really did write that.

09:42.000 --> 09:46.880
And to substantiate the rest of my statement, climatologists, even the sceptics,

09:46.880 --> 09:50.800
all agree that the figure is in fact around three times higher.

09:50.800 --> 09:55.280
Even Linsen, whose paper Monckton cites, puts the figure three times higher.

09:56.240 --> 09:59.840
So I don't know what else I have to do to show that my claim is correct.

10:00.720 --> 10:04.880
Now of course various factors might make it appear that forcing is less,

10:04.880 --> 10:09.360
but that's called sensitivity, which is something completely different.

10:09.360 --> 10:14.160
And that brings us on to the next Monckton error, that he confused forcing with sensitivity.

10:14.800 --> 10:19.600
I gave an explanation of forcing and sensitivity in one of my Monckton Buncombe videos.

10:19.600 --> 10:23.440
If you open all the windows on a cold night, it might appear that the output

10:23.440 --> 10:26.720
of a heater has been reduced, but that's an illusion.

10:26.720 --> 10:29.840
The heater's still pumping out the same amount of heat.

10:29.840 --> 10:34.480
It's how the house responds to that heat source that decides the ultimate temperature.

10:35.200 --> 10:37.600
It's summed up in this very well-known equation.

10:38.160 --> 10:42.480
If Monckton for some reason thinks the earth is not responding to a CO2 increase

10:42.480 --> 10:48.720
in the way most climatologists conclude, what he should have done is reduce sensitivity by three.

10:49.760 --> 10:54.960
Nowhere in his what's up with that response does Monckton deny he mixed the two up.

10:54.960 --> 10:58.160
He just makes the most astonishing excuse for it,

10:58.160 --> 11:03.840
which is that it doesn't matter which you divide by three, it comes out to the same answer anyway.

11:04.800 --> 11:09.840
But even this excuse is belied by Monckton's belated attempts to cover up his mistake.

11:10.400 --> 11:16.560
In his opinion piece for the APS newsletter, he tells us quite clearly he divided forcing by three.

11:17.600 --> 11:21.680
But later he obviously realised his mistake, and in a response to critics,

11:21.680 --> 11:24.800
tried to pretend he'd divided sensitivity by three.

11:25.680 --> 11:29.440
This quiet reversal of position is the closest you'll ever get

11:29.440 --> 11:32.240
to an admission from Monckton that he made a mistake.

11:32.480 --> 11:37.600
He says a leading climate researcher found a loss of cloud cover is responsible for recent warming.

11:37.600 --> 11:39.520
She says it shows no such thing.

11:40.080 --> 11:44.800
Actually, what I showed in my video were three instances of Monckton citing a paper by Rachel

11:44.800 --> 11:50.480
Pinker and claiming that it demonstrated decreased cloud cover was responsible for recent warming.

11:51.040 --> 11:56.320
And I showed a statement from Dr Pinker explaining that her paper didn't demonstrate this at all,

11:56.320 --> 11:57.520
and that Monckton was wrong.

11:58.160 --> 11:59.520
What's Monckton's rebuttal?

12:00.080 --> 12:02.800
OK, there is a bit of a Monckton manoeuvre here.

12:02.800 --> 12:06.240
He no longer asserts that warming is due to decreased cloud cover.

12:06.240 --> 12:10.720
It's now just a hypothesis, and it doesn't come from Dr Pinker or the paper.

12:10.720 --> 12:13.920
It comes from Monckton's interpretation of her paper.

12:13.920 --> 12:15.120
So who's right?

12:15.840 --> 12:21.200
Now, before anyone starts thinking that maybe Dr Pinker, despite 30 years as a researcher,

12:21.200 --> 12:24.000
is not very bright and might have made a mistake,

12:24.000 --> 12:28.080
let me just get a character reference from someone who may be familiar to you.

12:28.800 --> 12:31.520
He is wholly unconcerned with the global warming debate.

12:31.520 --> 12:33.280
It's as though he lives on another planet.

12:33.280 --> 12:36.240
He lives for verifying whether satellites are doing their job.

12:36.240 --> 12:38.080
That's what Pinker is all about.

12:38.080 --> 12:40.800
Then my rebuttal of his claim obviously stands.

12:40.800 --> 12:44.000
Dr Pinker does indeed say that Monckton is wrong.

12:44.640 --> 12:48.720
Now, I never said Monckton misquoted scientists to mislead his audience,

12:48.720 --> 12:52.400
but I did show how he changed quotes in order to support his arguments.

12:53.040 --> 12:54.320
Monckton responds,

12:54.320 --> 12:57.920
No instances are given to support this libel, so I cannot comment.

12:58.560 --> 13:01.840
But of course instances are given very clearly.

13:01.840 --> 13:04.400
What you'll read next are the actual quotes,

13:04.400 --> 13:07.600
and what you'll hear are Mr Monckton's misquotes.

13:07.600 --> 13:10.560
There has been no global warming for a decade.

13:10.560 --> 13:12.080
We cannot explain why.

13:12.640 --> 13:15.200
It is a travesty that we can't.

13:15.200 --> 13:15.760
And he said,

13:16.640 --> 13:21.840
The Argeddon scenario that he depicts is not based on any scientific view.

13:22.560 --> 13:27.680
Unless we announce disasters, no one will listen.

13:28.640 --> 13:30.800
If Mr Monckton thinks I'm being libelous

13:30.800 --> 13:34.480
by showing him publicly giving altered versions of these quotes,

13:34.480 --> 13:38.960
great, sue me, and I'll be happy to produce all of this evidence in court.

13:40.000 --> 13:43.920
Monckton said planets with a high albedo are cooler than planets with a low albedo.

13:43.920 --> 13:47.600
Now, Monckton starts off his response with the carefully chosen words,

13:47.600 --> 13:50.240
If all other parameters be held constant.

13:51.120 --> 13:54.960
Now, this is correct, but Monckton didn't tell his audiences that.

13:54.960 --> 13:57.520
He didn't tell them that in order to make this conclusion,

13:57.520 --> 13:59.920
one has to strip away a planet's atmosphere.

14:00.480 --> 14:04.320
So a planet with an atmosphere is going to behave completely differently,

14:04.320 --> 14:07.040
and our planet does have an atmosphere.

14:07.040 --> 14:09.440
So what he told the audience was wrong.

14:10.400 --> 14:13.920
Then by using the Monckton manoeuvre to add the unassuming phrase,

14:13.920 --> 14:16.480
If all other parameters be held constant,

14:16.480 --> 14:18.560
Monckton accepts that what he said was wrong.

14:19.440 --> 14:22.400
Monckton gets information in peer-reviewed science papers wrong,

14:22.400 --> 14:23.360
and he responds,

14:23.360 --> 14:26.480
Not a single instance is cited. This is pure yah-boo.

14:27.120 --> 14:29.760
Of course an instance is cited, Mr Monckton.

14:29.760 --> 14:31.760
Several instances are cited.

14:31.760 --> 14:35.280
I cited your misquote of a paper by Scafetta and West,

14:35.280 --> 14:39.920
and of course I cited Johansson, and a paper by Sami Solanki et al.

14:39.920 --> 14:43.360
He says some planets are warming because of the sun. No, they're not.

14:43.360 --> 14:46.400
Again, I didn't write this. Someone put this on the forum,

14:46.400 --> 14:49.040
and it isn't really even a paraphrase of what I said,

14:49.040 --> 14:51.280
but Monckton's response is interesting anyway.

14:52.000 --> 14:56.560
There has indeed been evidence of simultaneous warming in many planets of the solar system,

14:56.560 --> 14:59.120
and I have mentioned this. Well, that's true.

14:59.120 --> 15:02.000
However, given the difficulties of reliable measurement and imaging,

15:02.000 --> 15:07.280
I have not sought to draw definitive conclusions about the role of the sun in global warming

15:07.280 --> 15:09.520
from such observations. Really?

15:10.240 --> 15:13.920
At the moment the polar ice caps of Mars are melting,

15:13.920 --> 15:17.760
there has been warming noticed on the surface of Jupiter,

15:17.760 --> 15:23.360
on one of the moons of Neptune, even on far distant Pluto, all at the same time.

15:24.000 --> 15:28.560
And why is this? Because astronauts are taking their 4x4s up into space?

15:28.560 --> 15:33.920
No. It's because the sun, as we'll see, has been remarkably active.

15:34.720 --> 15:38.480
I can't add to this except to say, another Monckton manoeuvre.

15:38.480 --> 15:42.480
Monckton is now completely denying something he said in front of audiences,

15:42.480 --> 15:45.040
and even filmed for distribution.

15:45.040 --> 15:48.880
He said that the International Astronomical Union has declared the sun is responsible

15:48.880 --> 15:50.720
for the recent warming. It didn't.

15:50.720 --> 15:55.280
And Monckton responds, I cited a paper given by Dr Habibulu Atusomatov

15:55.280 --> 15:59.200
at the 2004 symposium of the IAU in St Petersburg, Florida,

15:59.200 --> 16:03.200
but put IAU at the foot of the slide, rather than Dr Atusomatov's name.

16:03.840 --> 16:08.080
Well, I'd say that was a mistake, because Dr Atusomatov

16:08.080 --> 16:11.200
is clearly not the International Astronomical Union.

16:12.000 --> 16:16.800
And Monckton seems to make a habit of replacing the name Dr Atusomatov

16:16.800 --> 16:19.280
for the International Astronomical Union.

16:19.840 --> 16:23.760
Now, to slip up on a name once is perhaps understandable.

16:23.760 --> 16:26.240
To continue to do it is astonishing.

16:26.240 --> 16:30.480
Most solar physicists agree the International Astronomical Union in 2004 had a symposium on it.

16:30.480 --> 16:31.760
They concluded that that was the case.

16:31.760 --> 16:33.840
And this is not my conclusion, this is the conclusion of

16:33.840 --> 16:37.520
the International Astronomical Union symposium in 2004.

16:37.520 --> 16:38.640
This is what they said.

16:38.640 --> 16:41.120
Sun caused today's warming, today's warming is normal.

16:41.120 --> 16:43.120
Well, that covers all the responses.

16:43.120 --> 16:46.560
I'll have to put my conclusions in the second part of this video.
