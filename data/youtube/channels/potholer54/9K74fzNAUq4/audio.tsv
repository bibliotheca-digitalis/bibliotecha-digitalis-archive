0	4880	It seems Christopher Monckton has responded to my video series about him, sort of.
4880	9520	On the website What's Up With That, he replied not directly to the videos,
9520	12400	but to a loose summary of them that someone had posted.
13600	18240	What made Monckton's response interesting is that it wasn't really a rebuttal at all,
18240	22000	but for the most part an astonishing climb down in his position,
22000	24400	and even outright denial of what he said.
24800	28560	Once again, this needs very little comment from me because
28560	32400	Monckton is extremely good at debunking himself. Just watch.
33360	37200	First up, the claim that Monckton was Margaret Thatcher's science advisor.
37200	41840	I did advise Margaret Thatcher on many scientific and other matters, including climate change.
42640	48160	He may well have done, who knows, but that doesn't make him Margaret Thatcher's science advisor,
48160	51120	and that's the claim that's being made by his supporters.
51760	56320	I refuted Monckton's claim that he'd written a peer-reviewed paper, and he responded,
56320	58800	As was usual for Physics and Society at the time,
58800	63040	the journal's review editor, Professor Alvin Saperstein, reviewed the paper.
63680	69200	But that's routine editing, Mr Monckton, which every submission to the newsletter goes through.
69200	71680	It's not the same as peer review.
71680	75280	Physics and Society itself says it's not a peer-reviewed journal.
75280	80080	It's a forum for letters, commentary, book reviews, and non-peer-reviewed articles.
80640	84160	Surely anyone who understands scientific publishing knows the difference.
84720	86960	So my rebuttal of your claim is correct.
87680	90560	What about Monckton's claim that the Earth has been cooling?
90560	96800	In 2008, I said the Earth had been cooling since the turn of the millennium on 1st of January 2001.
96800	98400	So it had at that time.
98960	101600	Do the linear regression for yourself and see.
101600	106400	Recent warming, however, means that there's been little change in temperature since 2001.
106960	109440	No need to tell us what you said, Mr Monckton.
109440	111120	Here's what you actually said.
111120	115280	And what that looks to me like is a fairly hefty, and indeed it is,
115840	118560	statistically significant rate of fall.
118560	122800	But of course, cherry-picking start and end points over such a short period of time
122800	126000	is not any kind of guide to long-term temperature change.
126000	130640	In statistical parlance, any temperature decline you might have cherry-picked from the graph
130640	132720	is not statistically significant.
133280	135440	Of course, Monckton claimed that it was.
136000	139280	Statistically significant rate of fall.
139280	141280	But here's someone who contradicts him.
141920	145200	There has been a fall trend in temperatures.
145200	149520	It's not at present a statistically significant fall.
149520	151280	Who's the mystery rebutter?
151280	152880	Why, it's Monckton himself.
153760	156160	This is what I'll call the Monckton manoeuvre,
156160	161520	a subtle change in position whenever he gets caught out or realises he's made a mistake.
161520	163680	I'll let the two Moncktons argue about whether
163680	166880	Monckton's trend is statistically significant or not.
166880	171440	As we saw in my video, real climate scientists all agree that the trend is up,
171440	174400	and Monckton can't show where their analysis is wrong.
175600	178080	On overall melting of the Greenland ice cap,
178080	183360	Johannesson et al, whom I cited, reported a substantial net accumulation of snow,
183360	186880	fern and ice on Greenland from 1992 to 2003.
187760	189760	As I said, no he didn't.
189760	192560	Here, Monckton is simply repeating his claim,
192560	196240	even though I showed Johannesson's paper, which Monckton cites,
196240	199440	showing the complete opposite to what Monckton claims.
199440	201440	How much clearer can that be?
201440	203840	But Monckton simply repeats the claim as if
203840	207600	repeating it will magically make the paper change its text.
207600	210800	But if Monckton ever does get around to realising his mistake
210800	213520	by checking Johannesson's paper more closely,
213520	215920	watch out for the next Monckton manoeuvre.
215920	219680	My bet is he'll quietly eliminate the word net from his claim.
220320	223520	As for no systematic loss of ice in the Arctic,
223520	226240	well, before I show Monckton's response to this one,
226240	228560	let's just listen again to what he said.
229200	235440	So we're not looking at a sort of long-term systematic loss of ice in the Arctic.
235440	239440	As always, the best person to contradict this claim is Monckton himself.
239440	242480	Look for the Monckton manoeuvre buried inside his response.
243200	247280	Arctic ice has certainly declined ever since the satellites have been watching.
248240	249760	Yes, exactly.
249760	254000	So there is a long-term systematic loss of ice in the Arctic,
254000	258320	which is exactly what glaciologists and climatologists have been saying
258320	260720	and which Monckton previously denied.
260720	266800	So we're not looking at a sort of long-term systematic loss of ice in the Arctic.
267600	270480	Next, Monckton's claim that there's no correlation between
270480	273360	CO2 and temperatures over the past 500 million years.
273920	274880	Monckton responds,
275440	278320	there has indeed been a remarkable correlation between
278320	282400	CO2 and temperatures over the past 500 million years.
282400	282900	What?
283680	287360	You've been arguing all along that there was no correlation.
287360	289440	Oh, it's another Monckton manoeuvre.
289440	295040	So let's just go back to what you told your audiences repeatedly just a couple of years ago.
295040	300320	Here we get a rather prodigious mismatch again between CO2 concentration,
300320	304560	which is the black line, and temperature concentration, which is the blue line,
304560	307120	going right back to almost 600,000 years into the past.
307120	311200	Controversial is that again it doesn't show a terribly good link between the two.
311200	314960	And look at how little correlation there is in that graph between
314960	319440	temperature in blue there and CO2 concentration in black.
319440	324800	Now Monckton quietly drops that claim altogether and brazenly tells us the complete opposite.
326000	330400	Next, a pre-Cambrian ice planet shows that CO2 has no effect on the climate.
331040	334560	Okay, Monckton goes into a rather long and boring dissertation on this,
334560	336480	but here's the main point.
337040	340400	The reasonable point that I made quoting Professor Ian Plimer,
340400	343520	a geologist who has made a particular study of the period,
343520	349200	was that even allowing for the fact that the sun was 5% fainter in the neo-proterozoic than today,
349200	352800	and for the fact that the planet's albedo was much greater than now,
352800	356240	equatorial sea level glaciers could not have come and gone twice if
356240	360480	CO2 had had the very large warming effect that is now imagined.
360480	365600	Monckton ignores real research, which I cited, showing that carbon dioxide played
365600	369040	a crucial role in unlocking the earth from a global glaciation.
369840	374560	The question I asked in my video was if the earth was effectively deep frozen
374560	379440	with glaciers at the equator and a much weaker sun, as Monckton agrees,
380080	383920	and a high albedo that reflected most of the solar energy it did receive,
384480	388160	how did the earth emerge from this condition and turn into a hot house,
388160	390880	not just once, but perhaps two or three times?
391440	393840	Monckton doesn't even try to answer this question,
393840	398480	he simply repeats his belief that CO2 could not have unfrozen the earth,
398480	400880	but he gives no explanation for that belief.
401600	405680	He says there's been no change in Himalayan glaciers for 200 years, there has.
405680	407760	Let's just see where this claim comes from.
408480	410080	They're doing fine, by the way.
410080	413520	He's got 200 years of records from the days of the Raj,
413520	416160	when we first began monitoring these things, dead should know.
416960	420720	And the glaciers are showing no particular change in 200 years.
420720	424800	The only glacier that's declined a little is Gangotri, very famous glacier,
424800	427440	because there's been local geological instability,
427440	430000	nothing to do with global warming, all the others are doing fine.
430000	432880	Well, in the rebuttal, Monckton says something slightly different.
433760	437600	The pattern of advance and retreat of the glaciers is as much as it has been
437600	441520	over the past 200 years since the Raj first kept records,
441520	444560	but that's not what Monckton told his audiences.
444560	448240	He told them only one glacier had retreated, a little.
449040	452800	Astonishingly, Monckton has already done one Monckton manoeuvre on this
452800	454880	when I questioned him about his sources,
454880	458160	and he came up with the fact that Himalayan glaciers have been receding
458160	459520	since the 19th century.
460080	462560	Which of the three versions do you want to believe?
462560	464800	Well, I'm not inclined to believe any of them,
464800	469040	because this isn't a matter of belief, but of properly conducted studies,
469040	471840	and nowhere does Monckton cite a single study,
471840	475040	except reference to his exchanges with Professor Batt,
475040	479520	the man he claims is responsible for monitoring Himalayan glaciers.
479520	481680	But Monckton doesn't rebut my revelation
481680	485920	that Batt is not the person responsible for monitoring Himalayan glaciers.
485920	486960	How do I know?
486960	489280	Because Batt himself says so.
489840	491760	What's Monckton's answer to this?
491760	492480	None at all.
493440	495840	And that takes us very neatly on to the next claim,
496560	499760	which was that only one Himalayan glacier was retreating.
501200	504000	Of course, now there's a Monckton manoeuvre on this.
504000	507760	He now goes on to admit that many other glaciers are receding.
509040	512400	And he says, merely because I mentioned one glacier as receding,
512400	515600	it is not legitimate to infer that I said or implied
515600	518000	that only one glacier was receding.
518560	521040	The only glacier that's declined a little is Gangotri.
521040	523440	But I'm not inferring it, Mr Monckton.
523440	525440	You said it quite clearly.
525440	528000	The only glacier that's declined a little is Gangotri.
528000	530640	If you can't even stand by your original claim,
530640	535200	but exercise another slippery Monckton manoeuvre to deny you ever said it,
535200	537840	then I guess the first Mr Monckton was wrong,
537840	540000	and my rebuttal of him is correct.
540720	545520	Now Monckton's claim that CO2 forcing is 1.135 watts per square metre.
545520	546560	Here's his response.
547120	549600	A finding of low climate sensitivity in Linsen
549600	552480	suggests that the warming exercised by CO2
552480	557520	is equivalent to assuming a forcing of 1.135 watts per square metre.
558160	563040	Again, never mind what you think you said or what you meant to say, Mr Monckton.
563040	566400	Here's what you actually wrote in your APS opinion piece.
566960	571840	Forcing approximately equals 1.135 watts per square metre.
572880	577040	I know, let's make it go away for a second and see if it changes into something else.
579600	581280	Nope, he really did write that.
582000	586880	And to substantiate the rest of my statement, climatologists, even the sceptics,
586880	590800	all agree that the figure is in fact around three times higher.
590800	595280	Even Linsen, whose paper Monckton cites, puts the figure three times higher.
596240	599840	So I don't know what else I have to do to show that my claim is correct.
600720	604880	Now of course various factors might make it appear that forcing is less,
604880	609360	but that's called sensitivity, which is something completely different.
609360	614160	And that brings us on to the next Monckton error, that he confused forcing with sensitivity.
614800	619600	I gave an explanation of forcing and sensitivity in one of my Monckton Buncombe videos.
619600	623440	If you open all the windows on a cold night, it might appear that the output
623440	626720	of a heater has been reduced, but that's an illusion.
626720	629840	The heater's still pumping out the same amount of heat.
629840	634480	It's how the house responds to that heat source that decides the ultimate temperature.
635200	637600	It's summed up in this very well-known equation.
638160	642480	If Monckton for some reason thinks the earth is not responding to a CO2 increase
642480	648720	in the way most climatologists conclude, what he should have done is reduce sensitivity by three.
649760	654960	Nowhere in his what's up with that response does Monckton deny he mixed the two up.
654960	658160	He just makes the most astonishing excuse for it,
658160	663840	which is that it doesn't matter which you divide by three, it comes out to the same answer anyway.
664800	669840	But even this excuse is belied by Monckton's belated attempts to cover up his mistake.
670400	676560	In his opinion piece for the APS newsletter, he tells us quite clearly he divided forcing by three.
677600	681680	But later he obviously realised his mistake, and in a response to critics,
681680	684800	tried to pretend he'd divided sensitivity by three.
685680	689440	This quiet reversal of position is the closest you'll ever get
689440	692240	to an admission from Monckton that he made a mistake.
692480	697600	He says a leading climate researcher found a loss of cloud cover is responsible for recent warming.
697600	699520	She says it shows no such thing.
700080	704800	Actually, what I showed in my video were three instances of Monckton citing a paper by Rachel
704800	710480	Pinker and claiming that it demonstrated decreased cloud cover was responsible for recent warming.
711040	716320	And I showed a statement from Dr Pinker explaining that her paper didn't demonstrate this at all,
716320	717520	and that Monckton was wrong.
718160	719520	What's Monckton's rebuttal?
720080	722800	OK, there is a bit of a Monckton manoeuvre here.
722800	726240	He no longer asserts that warming is due to decreased cloud cover.
726240	730720	It's now just a hypothesis, and it doesn't come from Dr Pinker or the paper.
730720	733920	It comes from Monckton's interpretation of her paper.
733920	735120	So who's right?
735840	741200	Now, before anyone starts thinking that maybe Dr Pinker, despite 30 years as a researcher,
741200	744000	is not very bright and might have made a mistake,
744000	748080	let me just get a character reference from someone who may be familiar to you.
748800	751520	He is wholly unconcerned with the global warming debate.
751520	753280	It's as though he lives on another planet.
753280	756240	He lives for verifying whether satellites are doing their job.
756240	758080	That's what Pinker is all about.
758080	760800	Then my rebuttal of his claim obviously stands.
760800	764000	Dr Pinker does indeed say that Monckton is wrong.
764640	768720	Now, I never said Monckton misquoted scientists to mislead his audience,
768720	772400	but I did show how he changed quotes in order to support his arguments.
773040	774320	Monckton responds,
774320	777920	No instances are given to support this libel, so I cannot comment.
778560	781840	But of course instances are given very clearly.
781840	784400	What you'll read next are the actual quotes,
784400	787600	and what you'll hear are Mr Monckton's misquotes.
787600	790560	There has been no global warming for a decade.
790560	792080	We cannot explain why.
792640	795200	It is a travesty that we can't.
795200	795760	And he said,
796640	801840	The Argeddon scenario that he depicts is not based on any scientific view.
802560	807680	Unless we announce disasters, no one will listen.
808640	810800	If Mr Monckton thinks I'm being libelous
810800	814480	by showing him publicly giving altered versions of these quotes,
814480	818960	great, sue me, and I'll be happy to produce all of this evidence in court.
820000	823920	Monckton said planets with a high albedo are cooler than planets with a low albedo.
823920	827600	Now, Monckton starts off his response with the carefully chosen words,
827600	830240	If all other parameters be held constant.
831120	834960	Now, this is correct, but Monckton didn't tell his audiences that.
834960	837520	He didn't tell them that in order to make this conclusion,
837520	839920	one has to strip away a planet's atmosphere.
840480	844320	So a planet with an atmosphere is going to behave completely differently,
844320	847040	and our planet does have an atmosphere.
847040	849440	So what he told the audience was wrong.
850400	853920	Then by using the Monckton manoeuvre to add the unassuming phrase,
853920	856480	If all other parameters be held constant,
856480	858560	Monckton accepts that what he said was wrong.
859440	862400	Monckton gets information in peer-reviewed science papers wrong,
862400	863360	and he responds,
863360	866480	Not a single instance is cited. This is pure yah-boo.
867120	869760	Of course an instance is cited, Mr Monckton.
869760	871760	Several instances are cited.
871760	875280	I cited your misquote of a paper by Scafetta and West,
875280	879920	and of course I cited Johansson, and a paper by Sami Solanki et al.
879920	883360	He says some planets are warming because of the sun. No, they're not.
883360	886400	Again, I didn't write this. Someone put this on the forum,
886400	889040	and it isn't really even a paraphrase of what I said,
889040	891280	but Monckton's response is interesting anyway.
892000	896560	There has indeed been evidence of simultaneous warming in many planets of the solar system,
896560	899120	and I have mentioned this. Well, that's true.
899120	902000	However, given the difficulties of reliable measurement and imaging,
902000	907280	I have not sought to draw definitive conclusions about the role of the sun in global warming
907280	909520	from such observations. Really?
910240	913920	At the moment the polar ice caps of Mars are melting,
913920	917760	there has been warming noticed on the surface of Jupiter,
917760	923360	on one of the moons of Neptune, even on far distant Pluto, all at the same time.
924000	928560	And why is this? Because astronauts are taking their 4x4s up into space?
928560	933920	No. It's because the sun, as we'll see, has been remarkably active.
934720	938480	I can't add to this except to say, another Monckton manoeuvre.
938480	942480	Monckton is now completely denying something he said in front of audiences,
942480	945040	and even filmed for distribution.
945040	948880	He said that the International Astronomical Union has declared the sun is responsible
948880	950720	for the recent warming. It didn't.
950720	955280	And Monckton responds, I cited a paper given by Dr Habibulu Atusomatov
955280	959200	at the 2004 symposium of the IAU in St Petersburg, Florida,
959200	963200	but put IAU at the foot of the slide, rather than Dr Atusomatov's name.
963840	968080	Well, I'd say that was a mistake, because Dr Atusomatov
968080	971200	is clearly not the International Astronomical Union.
972000	976800	And Monckton seems to make a habit of replacing the name Dr Atusomatov
976800	979280	for the International Astronomical Union.
979840	983760	Now, to slip up on a name once is perhaps understandable.
