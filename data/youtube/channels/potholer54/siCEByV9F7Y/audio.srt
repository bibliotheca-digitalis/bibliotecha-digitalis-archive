1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,200
All right, if you're God, reveal your Godhead.

2
00:00:03,200 --> 00:00:05,200
No, no, no, no.

3
00:00:05,200 --> 00:00:08,200
A miracle. Show us a miracle.

4
00:00:08,200 --> 00:00:09,700
Here's a miracle.

5
00:00:09,700 --> 00:00:10,700
Why?

6
00:00:10,700 --> 00:00:12,700
This hand.

7
00:00:12,700 --> 00:00:14,700
No, I don't mean that sort of miracle.

8
00:00:14,700 --> 00:00:17,700
I mean a proper miracle, like the loaves and the fishes.

9
00:00:17,700 --> 00:00:20,200
Yes, they were proper miracles.

10
00:00:20,200 --> 00:00:23,200
Ask answers in Genesis to name their top miracles,

11
00:00:23,200 --> 00:00:25,200
and this is what they give you.

12
00:00:25,200 --> 00:00:27,000
The parting of the Red Sea,

13
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:29,000
Jesus coming back to life,

14
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:31,000
and Jesus walking on water.

15
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:32,700
Their conclusion?

16
00:00:32,700 --> 00:00:35,700
Natural explanations, in other words science,

17
00:00:35,700 --> 00:00:38,700
can't account for any of these miracles.

18
00:00:38,700 --> 00:00:41,200
But science also can't explain how Athena

19
00:00:41,200 --> 00:00:43,700
sprang fully armoured from the head of Zeus.

20
00:00:43,700 --> 00:00:46,700
It can't explain how looking at Medusa's face

21
00:00:46,700 --> 00:00:48,700
turned people into stone.

22
00:00:48,700 --> 00:00:51,200
Maybe the problem isn't science.

23
00:00:51,200 --> 00:00:54,700
Maybe it's the veracity of these ancient stories.

24
00:00:55,700 --> 00:00:58,500
So if these were proper miracles,

25
00:00:58,500 --> 00:01:01,000
how can we never see any of them today?

26
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:03,000
Like the loaves and the fishes,

27
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:06,000
or the miracle of Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego,

28
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,500
who were thrown into a fiery furnace

29
00:01:08,500 --> 00:01:12,000
and yet walked around inside the flames unharmed.

30
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:15,000
Instead of raising Lazarus,

31
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:17,000
I'll raise you a table.

32
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:19,000
What? That table?

33
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:21,000
Ten feet.

34
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:23,000
Rise up.

35
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:25,000
Slowly.

36
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:27,000
Lonely.

37
00:01:27,500 --> 00:01:29,500
Rise up.

38
00:01:30,500 --> 00:01:32,500
One foot.

39
00:01:32,500 --> 00:01:34,500
Two.

40
00:01:34,500 --> 00:01:36,500
Three.

41
00:01:36,500 --> 00:01:38,500
Four.

42
00:01:38,500 --> 00:01:40,500
Slowly.

43
00:01:40,500 --> 00:01:42,500
Slowly.

44
00:01:42,500 --> 00:01:44,500
Five.

45
00:01:44,500 --> 00:01:46,500
Six.

46
00:01:46,500 --> 00:01:48,500
Seven.

47
00:01:48,500 --> 00:01:50,500
Eight.

48
00:01:50,500 --> 00:01:52,500
Nine.

49
00:01:52,500 --> 00:01:54,500
Ten.

50
00:01:54,500 --> 00:01:58,000
The table floats ten feet in space.

51
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,000
I think it's a bloody miracle.

52
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:03,000
I once asked a Christian to give me an example

53
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:05,000
of a modern day miracle.

54
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:07,000
And he said, a sunset.

55
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:09,000
Look, it's beautiful.

56
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:11,000
A miracle of God's creation.

57
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:15,000
But miracles are supposed to defy natural explanation.

58
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:17,000
A sunset is a gaseous body of hydrogen

59
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:20,000
fusing into helium under gravitational pressure,

60
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,000
emitting white light which gets scattered

61
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,000
in the atmosphere as the Earth rotates

62
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,000
so that we predominantly see the longer

63
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:29,500
wavelength bands of the electromagnetic spectrum.

64
00:02:29,500 --> 00:02:31,500
Then we have the miracle of people surviving

65
00:02:31,500 --> 00:02:33,500
plane crashes and avalanches.

66
00:02:33,500 --> 00:02:37,500
And again, these have perfectly natural explanations.

67
00:02:37,500 --> 00:02:39,500
It would be a strange world indeed

68
00:02:39,500 --> 00:02:43,500
if people never survived air crashes and avalanches.

69
00:02:43,500 --> 00:02:45,500
And word to Pat Robertson,

70
00:02:45,500 --> 00:02:47,500
just calling fish oil a miracle

71
00:02:47,500 --> 00:02:50,500
doesn't make it any less of a TV commercial.

72
00:02:50,500 --> 00:02:52,500
The miracle of fish oil,

73
00:02:52,500 --> 00:02:54,000
man, we appreciate this.

74
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:55,000
This book is available now.

75
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:57,000
The Omega Zone, a miracle of the

76
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:59,000
RX of high dose fish oil.

77
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:01,000
It's a bloody miracle!

78
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:03,000
You have what, fourteen patents on stuff?

79
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:05,000
Yes.

80
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:08,000
Never heard of anyone taking out patents on a miracle.

81
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:11,000
So I spent a bit of time looking for a real miracle,

82
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:14,000
like three men walking inside a fiery furnace.

83
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,000
Then I found it.

84
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:19,000
I asked a Catholic on my channel forum

85
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:21,000
to give me the very best example of a miracle.

86
00:03:21,500 --> 00:03:23,500
And he said, that's easy.

87
00:03:23,500 --> 00:03:25,500
The rosary miracle of Hiroshima.

88
00:03:25,500 --> 00:03:27,500
The what now?

89
00:03:27,500 --> 00:03:30,500
Surely I'd heard of the rosary miracle of Hiroshima,

90
00:03:30,500 --> 00:03:34,500
eight Jesuits who survived the atomic bombing in 1945.

91
00:03:34,500 --> 00:03:37,500
Apparently it's famous in Catholic circles

92
00:03:37,500 --> 00:03:40,500
as one of the best examples of a modern day miracle.

93
00:03:40,500 --> 00:03:42,500
Here's how it goes.

94
00:03:42,500 --> 00:03:46,500
The blast wave was found as far away as 37 miles.

95
00:03:46,500 --> 00:03:49,500
Two thirds of the city's buildings were destroyed.

96
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,000
Although no official figure exists,

97
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:56,000
it is estimated that between 80,000 to 140,000 people

98
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:59,000
were killed instantly in the blast.

99
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:01,000
The hundreds of fires,

100
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:03,000
ignited by the thermal pulse,

101
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:05,000
combined to produce a firestorm

102
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:07,000
that incinerated everything

103
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:10,000
within 4.4 miles of ground zero.

104
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:24,000
Yet incredibly less than a half mile away from ground zero,

105
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:28,000
eight German Jesuit priests staggered out of their home,

106
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:31,000
one of the few buildings still standing in that area,

107
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:33,000
with only relatively minor injury.

108
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:35,000
Later, all eight of these men

109
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:38,000
would be examined by U.S. Army medical experts,

110
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:41,000
along with the other survivors of the blast.

111
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:43,000
According to these medical reports,

112
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:45,000
the Jesuit priests suffered no signs

113
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:47,000
of the explosion of the blast.

114
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:48,500
According to these medical reports,

115
00:04:48,500 --> 00:04:51,500
the Jesuit priests suffered no signs of elevated radiation

116
00:04:51,500 --> 00:04:53,500
or indeed any of the other ill effects

117
00:04:53,500 --> 00:04:56,500
experienced by the other survivors.

118
00:04:56,500 --> 00:04:58,500
Speaking on behalf of all eight men,

119
00:04:58,500 --> 00:05:00,500
30 year old Father Hubert Schiffer

120
00:05:00,500 --> 00:05:02,500
had only one explanation.

121
00:05:02,500 --> 00:05:05,500
We believe that we survived

122
00:05:05,500 --> 00:05:08,500
because we were living the message of Fatima.

123
00:05:08,500 --> 00:05:12,500
Wow, take that Shadrach, Meshach and Abednego.

124
00:05:12,500 --> 00:05:14,500
You only survived a fiery furnace.

125
00:05:14,500 --> 00:05:17,000
These eight priests stood in front of an exploding

126
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:21,000
nuclear-frigging bomb and weren't even hurt.

127
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:23,500
After it was over, Father Hubert Schiffer

128
00:05:23,500 --> 00:05:26,500
relayed the story to another priest who reported,

129
00:05:26,500 --> 00:05:29,000
The only physical harm to himself

130
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:31,000
was that he could feel a few pieces of glass

131
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:32,500
in the back of his neck.

132
00:05:32,500 --> 00:05:34,000
As far as he could tell,

133
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:37,000
there was nothing else physically wrong with himself.

134
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:40,000
All eight priests went on to live out their days in full health

135
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:43,500
with no cancer or side effects from radiation.

136
00:05:43,500 --> 00:05:45,500
And of course, priests don't lie.

137
00:05:45,500 --> 00:05:48,000
Their residence should have been utterly destroyed.

138
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,000
Severe lung and heart damage,

139
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:52,000
heads blown off, skulls crushed,

140
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,000
cotton clothes catching fire.

141
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:56,500
There are no physical laws to explain

142
00:05:56,500 --> 00:06:00,500
why the Jesuits were untouched in the Hiroshima air blast.

143
00:06:00,500 --> 00:06:03,000
They received enough radiation to be dead

144
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:05,000
within at most a matter of minutes.

145
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:08,000
What happened to those Jesuits at Hiroshima

146
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:11,000
still defies all human logic.

147
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:13,000
The story is not only in blogs,

148
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:15,500
it's been written up in the Catholic News Agency

149
00:06:15,500 --> 00:06:17,500
and in the Catholic Herald,

150
00:06:17,500 --> 00:06:20,500
which tells us practically everything was vaporized

151
00:06:20,500 --> 00:06:22,500
within a mile of the point of impact,

152
00:06:22,500 --> 00:06:26,000
and yet the eight priests escaped virtually unscathed.

153
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:29,500
And yes, they say this is just like the three biblical figures

154
00:06:29,500 --> 00:06:31,500
thrown into the fiery furnace.

155
00:06:31,500 --> 00:06:34,000
The miracle is even used to sell rosaries.

156
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:35,500
Same story again.

157
00:06:35,500 --> 00:06:38,500
Eight priests who prayed to the rosary every day,

158
00:06:38,500 --> 00:06:41,000
just eight blocks from the atomic explosion,

159
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:44,000
minor injuries, no radiation sickness.

160
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:45,500
So buy a rosary,

161
00:06:45,500 --> 00:06:48,500
and you too can survive a nuclear bomb.

162
00:06:48,500 --> 00:06:50,500
Well, I'm convinced.

163
00:06:50,500 --> 00:06:52,500
Unless, of course, miracles are just real

164
00:06:52,500 --> 00:06:54,500
and easily explained events

165
00:06:54,500 --> 00:06:57,500
that then become grossly exaggerated.

166
00:06:57,500 --> 00:06:59,500
As you know, the first thing to ask

167
00:06:59,500 --> 00:07:01,500
when you hear something extraordinary is,

168
00:07:01,500 --> 00:07:03,500
what's your source?

169
00:07:03,500 --> 00:07:07,000
The miracle account gives us the names of the eight priests,

170
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:09,500
so that's a starting point.

171
00:07:09,500 --> 00:07:11,000
I tracked down the source

172
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:13,000
to an original report of the incident

173
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:15,000
and the one that seems to have publicized it

174
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:17,000
the most at the time.

175
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:21,000
This New Yorker magazine article dated August 1946,

176
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:23,000
a year after the Hiroshima bombing,

177
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:25,000
quickly sold out of newsstands

178
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:27,000
and was made into a book.

179
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:29,000
The author, John Hersey,

180
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:31,000
interviewed six survivors at the bombing

181
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:33,000
who recounted what happened to them

182
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:35,000
and the people around them.

183
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:39,000
Only one was a Catholic priest, Father Kleinsauger,

184
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:41,500
and although surviving an atomic bomb explosion

185
00:07:41,500 --> 00:07:43,500
is a remarkable story,

186
00:07:43,500 --> 00:07:45,500
his experience was no more remarkable

187
00:07:45,500 --> 00:07:47,500
than any of the other five survivors

188
00:07:47,500 --> 00:07:49,500
interviewed by Hersey,

189
00:07:49,500 --> 00:07:51,500
all of whom were Japanese

190
00:07:51,500 --> 00:07:53,500
and only one a Christian.

191
00:07:53,500 --> 00:07:57,500
Hersey never singled out Kleinsauger's story as exceptional

192
00:07:57,500 --> 00:07:59,500
and there was no mention of a miracle.

193
00:07:59,500 --> 00:08:02,500
But perhaps because Kleinsauger was Caucasian,

194
00:08:02,500 --> 00:08:05,500
the story of the priest grabbed people's attention.

195
00:08:05,500 --> 00:08:08,500
Another of them, Father John Simms,

196
00:08:08,500 --> 00:08:12,000
gave an interview detailing his own story of survival.

197
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:15,000
But as I investigated some of the details,

198
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:17,000
a few things didn't add up.

199
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:19,000
Let's start with the primary source,

200
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:21,000
the New Yorker story.

201
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:23,500
Father Kleinsauger told the New Yorker

202
00:08:23,500 --> 00:08:25,000
that he and his fellow priests

203
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:27,000
were staying at a downtown mission house

204
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:30,000
in Noboricho, about 1,400 yards

205
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:32,000
from the centre of the explosion.

206
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:34,000
That's about 0.8 miles.

207
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:36,500
Here's Noboricho and the first thing you notice

208
00:08:36,500 --> 00:08:38,500
is that it's nearer to the edge

209
00:08:38,500 --> 00:08:41,500
than the centre of that one-mile destruction zone.

210
00:08:41,500 --> 00:08:45,000
But okay, still a dangerous place to be.

211
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:47,000
Then it turns out that although houses

212
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:49,000
all around them were flattened in the blast,

213
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:51,500
the mission house had been double-braced

214
00:08:51,500 --> 00:08:54,000
to withstand powerful earthquakes.

215
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:56,000
And far from being vaporised,

216
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:59,000
there were lots of survivors in the blast zone.

217
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:01,000
But unlike the mission house,

218
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:03,000
their homes weren't reinforced.

219
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:06,000
So many were trapped under collapsed houses.

220
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:08,000
They didn't die because of the blast.

221
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:10,500
They died later when fires spread.

222
00:09:10,500 --> 00:09:12,500
Others who survived in the streets

223
00:09:12,500 --> 00:09:14,000
tried to put out the fires

224
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:16,000
or ran towards the river.

225
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:18,500
So clearly the priests weren't the only survivors

226
00:09:18,500 --> 00:09:20,000
walking around.

227
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:23,000
The New Yorker doesn't give figures for survival rates

228
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:25,500
so I checked a 1956 study titled

229
00:09:25,500 --> 00:09:28,500
Medical Effects of the Atomic Bomb in Japan.

230
00:09:28,500 --> 00:09:30,500
In the zone that priests were in,

231
00:09:30,500 --> 00:09:33,500
the survival rate was 48.4%.

232
00:09:33,500 --> 00:09:37,000
In other words, half the people there survived.

233
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:39,000
But even in a reinforced house

234
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:40,500
that can withstand the blast,

235
00:09:40,500 --> 00:09:42,500
still a miracle that all eight

236
00:09:42,500 --> 00:09:46,000
survived completely unscathed, right?

237
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:48,000
But again, the priests told the New Yorker

238
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:50,000
a different story.

239
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:52,000
According to Kleinzauger's account,

240
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:55,000
at least two priests were seriously injured.

241
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:56,500
Blood was spurting from a wound

242
00:09:56,500 --> 00:09:58,500
in Father Schiffer's head.

243
00:09:58,500 --> 00:10:00,500
Lying on the ground, he whispered,

244
00:10:00,500 --> 00:10:03,500
It's as if I were already dead.

245
00:10:03,500 --> 00:10:07,000
Father Superior LaSalle was covered in blood.

246
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:09,500
Only Father Kleinzauger and Father Cieslik

247
00:10:09,500 --> 00:10:11,000
escaped with minor injuries,

248
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:13,500
according to the New Yorker account.

249
00:10:13,500 --> 00:10:15,000
In Father Cieslik's case,

250
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:17,000
not because he prayed on his rosary

251
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:18,500
and hoped for a miracle,

252
00:10:18,500 --> 00:10:20,000
but because he had the foresight

253
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:22,000
to take refuge under a doorway,

254
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:25,000
one of the strongest parts of the house.

255
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:27,000
And the New Yorker account is corroborated

256
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:29,000
by the priests themselves.

257
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:32,000
According to a written account by Father John Simms,

258
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:35,000
Father Schiffer is on the ground pale as a ghost.

259
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:37,500
He has a deep incised wound behind the ear

260
00:10:37,500 --> 00:10:39,000
and has lost so much blood

261
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:42,500
that we're concerned about his chances for survival.

262
00:10:42,500 --> 00:10:44,000
The Father Superior has suffered

263
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:46,000
a deep wound of the lower leg.

264
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:48,000
Father Cieslik and Father Kleinzauger

265
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:51,500
have minor injuries but are completely exhausted.

266
00:10:51,500 --> 00:10:54,000
So that accounts for four of the priests,

267
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:56,500
but what about the other four?

268
00:10:56,500 --> 00:10:58,000
Well, the reason they weren't part

269
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:00,000
of the New Yorker story is because

270
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:02,000
they were in a separate building.

271
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:04,500
We'll let the US Army film about Father Simms

272
00:11:04,500 --> 00:11:06,500
tell that part of the story.

273
00:11:06,500 --> 00:11:09,000
Between Zero Point and the main building

274
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:11,500
of the novitiate of Jesuits, four miles away...

275
00:11:11,500 --> 00:11:13,500
Hang on, four miles away?

276
00:11:13,500 --> 00:11:15,500
...was a hill which served to lessen

277
00:11:15,500 --> 00:11:16,500
the intensity of the blast.

278
00:11:16,500 --> 00:11:18,500
Now there's a hill between the main building

279
00:11:18,500 --> 00:11:20,500
and the blast site four miles away?

280
00:11:20,500 --> 00:11:23,000
Yes, it turns out the other four priests

281
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:24,500
weren't even in Hiroshima

282
00:11:24,500 --> 00:11:26,500
at the time the bomb was dropped.

283
00:11:26,500 --> 00:11:28,500
In his written account, Father Simms said

284
00:11:28,500 --> 00:11:30,500
the building was in Nangatsuke,

285
00:11:30,500 --> 00:11:32,000
up a valley going into the mountains

286
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:36,000
about two kilometres from the edge of the city.

287
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:37,000
But there's one hope left

288
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:40,000
for this increasingly shaky miracle.

289
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:42,000
What about the fact that the four priests

290
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:45,000
escaped any kind of radiation sickness?

291
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:47,500
The religious sources say they were examined

292
00:11:47,500 --> 00:11:50,000
by doctors hundreds of times.

293
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:52,500
Problem is, none of the religious sources

294
00:11:52,500 --> 00:11:56,000
cites a single medical report to substantiate this

295
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:58,500
and the only medical examination I could find

296
00:11:58,500 --> 00:12:00,500
was of two of the priests,

297
00:12:00,500 --> 00:12:02,500
as reported by Father Simms.

298
00:12:02,500 --> 00:12:04,500
He tells a different story.

299
00:12:04,500 --> 00:12:07,000
Father Kleinzorger and Father Cieslik,

300
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:09,000
who were near the centre of the explosion

301
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:11,000
but who did not suffer burns,

302
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:15,000
became quite weak some 14 days after the explosion.

303
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:18,500
The attending physician diagnosed it as leukopenia.

304
00:12:18,500 --> 00:12:20,500
Leukopenia is a decrease in the number

305
00:12:20,500 --> 00:12:22,000
of white blood cells,

306
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:25,500
a classic symptom of radiation sickness.

307
00:12:25,500 --> 00:12:28,000
A retrospective by the New York Times

308
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:31,000
reported in 1985 that Father Kleinzorger

309
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:37,000
suffered from a classic case history of A-bomb sickness.

310
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:40,000
The medical history of the other two priests isn't known

311
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:44,500
but Father Schiffer died at either age 63 or 67,

312
00:12:44,500 --> 00:12:47,000
relatively young.

313
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:49,000
So after a bit of fact-checking,

314
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:51,000
how's the miracle doing?

315
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:54,000
Yet incredibly, less than a half mile away from ground zero...

316
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:56,500
More than half a mile away from ground zero...

317
00:12:56,500 --> 00:12:58,500
eight German Jesuit priests...

318
00:12:58,500 --> 00:13:00,500
four German Jesuit priests...

319
00:13:00,500 --> 00:13:02,000
staggered out of their home,

320
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:04,500
one of the few buildings still standing in that area...

321
00:13:04,500 --> 00:13:07,000
because it had been double-braced and reinforced...

322
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:09,000
with only relatively minor injuries...

323
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:11,000
two of them with severe injuries.

324
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:13,000
According to these medical reports,

325
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:16,000
the Jesuit priests suffered no signs of elevated radiation

326
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:19,000
or indeed any of the other ill effects experienced

327
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:20,500
by the other survivors.

328
00:13:20,500 --> 00:13:23,000
At least two of the priests suffered radiation sickness

329
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:25,500
and a third died in his mid-60s.

330
00:13:25,500 --> 00:13:27,500
Speaking on behalf of all eight men,

331
00:13:27,500 --> 00:13:32,000
30-year-old Father Hubert Schiffer had only one explanation.

332
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:34,500
We believe that we survived

333
00:13:34,500 --> 00:13:37,500
because we were living the message of Fatima.

334
00:13:37,500 --> 00:13:41,500
Or you survived because half of the people in your area also survived.

335
00:13:41,500 --> 00:13:44,000
In fact, two of the priests fared even worse

336
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:47,000
than 2,500 Japanese residents

337
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:50,000
in the same damage zone who escaped injury.

338
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:53,500
For some reason, these are not called miracles.

339
00:13:53,500 --> 00:13:57,000
So how do atheists explain this so-called miracle?

340
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:58,000
Very easily.

341
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:00,500
By simply checking the records,

342
00:14:00,500 --> 00:14:04,500
something we can't do with alleged miracles from the Bronze Age.

343
00:14:04,500 --> 00:14:06,500
The more interesting question is

344
00:14:06,500 --> 00:14:08,500
how was this miracle fabricated

345
00:14:08,500 --> 00:14:11,000
out of something that's so well documented

346
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:13,000
and easily fact-checked?

347
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:16,000
In 1953, Father Schiffer wrote a booklet

348
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:19,500
in which he linked his survival to praying with the rosary.

349
00:14:19,500 --> 00:14:21,500
He named the four priests involved

350
00:14:21,500 --> 00:14:24,000
and mentioned only that they were wounded.

351
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:26,500
23 years on, Schiffer gave an interview

352
00:14:26,500 --> 00:14:29,000
about the incident to Father Paul Ruger

353
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:32,500
at the 1976 Eucharist Congress in Philadelphia.

354
00:14:32,500 --> 00:14:34,000
He attributed his survival

355
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:36,000
not to the reinforcement of the house

356
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:39,000
but because we were living the message of Fatima.

357
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:43,000
We lived and prayed the rosary daily in that home.

358
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:45,500
And he downplayed his injuries even more.

359
00:14:45,500 --> 00:14:48,000
Now it was just a few pieces of glass

360
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:49,500
in the back of his neck

361
00:14:49,500 --> 00:14:51,500
and nothing else physically wrong.

362
00:14:51,500 --> 00:14:53,500
So the progression of this miracle

363
00:14:53,500 --> 00:14:56,000
is that we go from a priest who's on the ground

364
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:58,000
pale as a ghost, whispering that he feels

365
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:00,000
as if he's already dead,

366
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:01,500
to one who's wounded,

367
00:15:01,500 --> 00:15:04,000
then nothing wrong except a fragment of glass,

368
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:06,000
to completely unscathed.

369
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:08,500
Tis but a scratch. A scratch!

370
00:15:08,500 --> 00:15:11,000
This is more than just debunking a silly myth.

371
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:13,000
It shows how an easily explained event

372
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:15,500
can be embellished, exaggerated, altered,

373
00:15:15,500 --> 00:15:17,500
and turned into a miracle.

374
00:15:17,500 --> 00:15:19,500
As long as those who want to believe it

375
00:15:19,500 --> 00:15:21,000
don't fact-check it.

376
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:23,000
If this had happened 2,000 years ago

377
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:25,000
it would have made it into the Bible

378
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:27,000
instead of the Catholic Herald.

379
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:29,500
And with all the documentary evidence lost

380
00:15:29,500 --> 00:15:32,000
it would be cited as another miracle

381
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:33,500
that science can't explain,

382
00:15:33,500 --> 00:15:36,500
just like the three men in the fiery furnace.

383
00:15:36,500 --> 00:15:38,500
The Catholic Herald is right.

384
00:15:38,500 --> 00:15:40,000
The story of the eight priests surviving

385
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:42,500
an atomic bomb explosion unscathed

386
00:15:42,500 --> 00:15:45,000
is exactly like the story of three men

387
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:47,500
walking around in a fiery furnace.

388
00:15:47,500 --> 00:15:49,500
Get it?

389
00:15:49,500 --> 00:15:52,500
Few modern-day miracles have drawn bigger crowds

390
00:15:52,500 --> 00:15:54,500
than this recurring one.

391
00:15:54,500 --> 00:15:56,000
It goes like this.

392
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:57,000
God says,

393
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:59,000
I think I'll perform a few miracles.

394
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:02,000
Should I cure the kids in a cancer ward overnight?

395
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:03,000
Nah.

396
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:05,000
Regrow the limbs of an amputee.

397
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:08,000
How about making crops miraculously grow

398
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:10,000
in a drought-stricken area?

399
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:11,000
Puh.

400
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:12,000
I know.

401
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:14,000
I'll make a statue cry.

402
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:16,500
That will be really useful.

403
00:16:16,500 --> 00:16:20,000
And it was so popular he did it again and again.

404
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:21,500
These days it seems to be a miracle

405
00:16:21,500 --> 00:16:25,000
when a church doesn't produce a weeping Madonna.

406
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:27,000
There's so much competition

407
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:30,000
that your Madonna now has to do more than just weep.

408
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:32,500
This one sheds tears of blood.

409
00:16:32,500 --> 00:16:33,500
The only problem is

410
00:16:33,500 --> 00:16:36,500
this isn't a difficult miracle to perform.

411
00:16:36,500 --> 00:16:38,000
Most statues are hollow,

412
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:39,500
made of porous plaster,

413
00:16:39,500 --> 00:16:41,500
and glazed on the outside.

414
00:16:41,500 --> 00:16:43,500
If you fill the inside with water

415
00:16:43,500 --> 00:16:45,500
it seeps through the plaster,

416
00:16:45,500 --> 00:16:47,500
but because the glaze is waterproof

417
00:16:47,500 --> 00:16:49,500
the water just stays where it is,

418
00:16:49,500 --> 00:16:51,500
like filling a cup.

419
00:16:51,500 --> 00:16:53,000
But if you scratch away the glaze

420
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:55,000
where you want the water to come out,

421
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:56,500
like under the eyes,

422
00:16:56,500 --> 00:16:57,500
presto,

423
00:16:57,500 --> 00:16:59,000
a weeping Madonna.

424
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:00,000
This is so easy

425
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:01,500
that you don't even need to struggle

426
00:17:01,500 --> 00:17:03,500
through the crowds to see it.

427
00:17:03,500 --> 00:17:06,000
You can make your own graven image at home.

428
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:08,000
Invite your friends.

429
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:10,000
And as congregations begin to tire

430
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:11,500
of weeping Madonnas,

431
00:17:11,500 --> 00:17:14,000
slice things up a bit by using red dye.

432
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:16,000
Or scratch glaze off the nipple area

433
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:17,500
rather than the eyes,

434
00:17:17,500 --> 00:17:19,500
then fill the statue with milk.

435
00:17:19,500 --> 00:17:22,500
Amaze the faithful with your novelty suckling Madonna.

436
00:17:22,500 --> 00:17:24,000
It's a bloody miracle!

437
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:26,000
Miracles don't just happen in Christianity,

438
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:27,000
of course,

439
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:29,000
Islam is full of them.

440
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:30,000
But I couldn't find anything

441
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:32,000
to compete with the simple magic tricks

442
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:34,000
or well-documented fabrications

443
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:36,000
of the Christian church.

444
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:38,500
Muslims do this the way we saw at the beginning.

445
00:17:38,500 --> 00:17:39,500
Take an ordinary,

446
00:17:39,500 --> 00:17:41,000
easily explained event

447
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:43,500
and simply declare it to be a miracle.

448
00:17:43,500 --> 00:17:45,500
How can anyone prove it isn't?

449
00:17:45,500 --> 00:17:47,500
All these supposed miracles

450
00:17:47,500 --> 00:17:49,000
came from a video called

451
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:50,500
Top Ten Miracles.

452
00:17:50,500 --> 00:17:52,500
And what was their number one?

453
00:17:52,500 --> 00:17:55,500
This, I know, looks very ordinary,

454
00:17:55,500 --> 00:17:57,500
but Allah has written his name,

455
00:17:57,500 --> 00:17:58,500
this name,

456
00:17:58,500 --> 00:18:00,500
somewhere in this picture.

457
00:18:00,500 --> 00:18:02,000
Can you match the name

458
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:03,500
to the geographical feature?

459
00:18:03,500 --> 00:18:05,000
Pause the video

460
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:07,500
and give yourself 30 seconds to find it.

461
00:18:07,500 --> 00:18:09,500
OK, time's up.

462
00:18:09,500 --> 00:18:11,000
According to the video,

463
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:12,000
it's here.

464
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:13,500
And this, remember,

465
00:18:13,500 --> 00:18:15,000
is the top miracle

466
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:18,000
out of the top ten miracles.

467
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:20,000
My advice to Muslims is

468
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:22,000
don't try to compete with Christians

469
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:24,500
when it comes to finding symbols of your religion

470
00:18:24,500 --> 00:18:26,000
in natural patterns.

471
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:28,000
You have to find this.

472
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:30,500
All they have to do is find this.

473
00:18:30,500 --> 00:18:31,500
And believe me,

474
00:18:31,500 --> 00:18:32,500
that's so easy,

475
00:18:32,500 --> 00:18:34,000
they see it everywhere.

476
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:37,000
...laminin protein molecule.

477
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:39,000
It looks just like this.

478
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:42,500
They still don't give a flying f**k, do they?

479
00:18:42,500 --> 00:18:45,000
The perfect shape

480
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:48,000
of the cross of our Lord Jesus Christ.

481
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:49,500
Nah.

482
00:18:49,500 --> 00:18:50,500
Even I can spot

483
00:18:50,500 --> 00:18:53,000
a couple of very obvious crosses right here.

484
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:54,500
But that's because you can find

485
00:18:54,500 --> 00:18:57,500
pretty much anything you want to find in this picture,

486
00:18:57,500 --> 00:18:59,000
including the golden arches

487
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:01,000
of our Lord and Saviour, Ronald McDonald.

488
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:03,500
It didn't rise, there it is!

489
00:19:04,500 --> 00:19:06,000
Tuck us all!

490
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:07,000
Believe!

491
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:08,000
Did you see it, Doctor?

492
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:09,000
No.

493
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:11,500
Into my galvanised pressure cooker!

494
00:19:11,500 --> 00:19:13,000
There's no miracle!

495
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:14,000
Poor God.

496
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:15,500
He just can't get a break

497
00:19:15,500 --> 00:19:18,500
in this cynical fact-checking scientific age.

498
00:19:18,500 --> 00:19:20,500
The nearest thing we have to miracles these days

499
00:19:20,500 --> 00:19:22,000
are magic tricks,

500
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:23,500
and they're far more astonishing

501
00:19:23,500 --> 00:19:25,500
than weeping statues

502
00:19:25,500 --> 00:19:27,500
and squiggles in the sand.
