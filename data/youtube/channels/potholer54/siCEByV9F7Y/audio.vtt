00:00.000 --> 00:03.200
All right, if you're God, reveal your Godhead.

00:03.200 --> 00:05.200
No, no, no, no.

00:05.200 --> 00:08.200
A miracle. Show us a miracle.

00:08.200 --> 00:09.700
Here's a miracle.

00:09.700 --> 00:10.700
Why?

00:10.700 --> 00:12.700
This hand.

00:12.700 --> 00:14.700
No, I don't mean that sort of miracle.

00:14.700 --> 00:17.700
I mean a proper miracle, like the loaves and the fishes.

00:17.700 --> 00:20.200
Yes, they were proper miracles.

00:20.200 --> 00:23.200
Ask answers in Genesis to name their top miracles,

00:23.200 --> 00:25.200
and this is what they give you.

00:25.200 --> 00:27.000
The parting of the Red Sea,

00:27.000 --> 00:29.000
Jesus coming back to life,

00:29.000 --> 00:31.000
and Jesus walking on water.

00:31.000 --> 00:32.700
Their conclusion?

00:32.700 --> 00:35.700
Natural explanations, in other words science,

00:35.700 --> 00:38.700
can't account for any of these miracles.

00:38.700 --> 00:41.200
But science also can't explain how Athena

00:41.200 --> 00:43.700
sprang fully armoured from the head of Zeus.

00:43.700 --> 00:46.700
It can't explain how looking at Medusa's face

00:46.700 --> 00:48.700
turned people into stone.

00:48.700 --> 00:51.200
Maybe the problem isn't science.

00:51.200 --> 00:54.700
Maybe it's the veracity of these ancient stories.

00:55.700 --> 00:58.500
So if these were proper miracles,

00:58.500 --> 01:01.000
how can we never see any of them today?

01:01.000 --> 01:03.000
Like the loaves and the fishes,

01:03.000 --> 01:06.000
or the miracle of Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego,

01:06.000 --> 01:08.500
who were thrown into a fiery furnace

01:08.500 --> 01:12.000
and yet walked around inside the flames unharmed.

01:12.000 --> 01:15.000
Instead of raising Lazarus,

01:15.000 --> 01:17.000
I'll raise you a table.

01:17.000 --> 01:19.000
What? That table?

01:19.000 --> 01:21.000
Ten feet.

01:21.000 --> 01:23.000
Rise up.

01:23.000 --> 01:25.000
Slowly.

01:25.000 --> 01:27.000
Lonely.

01:27.500 --> 01:29.500
Rise up.

01:30.500 --> 01:32.500
One foot.

01:32.500 --> 01:34.500
Two.

01:34.500 --> 01:36.500
Three.

01:36.500 --> 01:38.500
Four.

01:38.500 --> 01:40.500
Slowly.

01:40.500 --> 01:42.500
Slowly.

01:42.500 --> 01:44.500
Five.

01:44.500 --> 01:46.500
Six.

01:46.500 --> 01:48.500
Seven.

01:48.500 --> 01:50.500
Eight.

01:50.500 --> 01:52.500
Nine.

01:52.500 --> 01:54.500
Ten.

01:54.500 --> 01:58.000
The table floats ten feet in space.

01:58.000 --> 02:00.000
I think it's a bloody miracle.

02:00.000 --> 02:03.000
I once asked a Christian to give me an example

02:03.000 --> 02:05.000
of a modern day miracle.

02:05.000 --> 02:07.000
And he said, a sunset.

02:07.000 --> 02:09.000
Look, it's beautiful.

02:09.000 --> 02:11.000
A miracle of God's creation.

02:11.000 --> 02:15.000
But miracles are supposed to defy natural explanation.

02:15.000 --> 02:17.000
A sunset is a gaseous body of hydrogen

02:17.000 --> 02:20.000
fusing into helium under gravitational pressure,

02:20.000 --> 02:22.000
emitting white light which gets scattered

02:22.000 --> 02:24.000
in the atmosphere as the Earth rotates

02:24.000 --> 02:26.000
so that we predominantly see the longer

02:26.000 --> 02:29.500
wavelength bands of the electromagnetic spectrum.

02:29.500 --> 02:31.500
Then we have the miracle of people surviving

02:31.500 --> 02:33.500
plane crashes and avalanches.

02:33.500 --> 02:37.500
And again, these have perfectly natural explanations.

02:37.500 --> 02:39.500
It would be a strange world indeed

02:39.500 --> 02:43.500
if people never survived air crashes and avalanches.

02:43.500 --> 02:45.500
And word to Pat Robertson,

02:45.500 --> 02:47.500
just calling fish oil a miracle

02:47.500 --> 02:50.500
doesn't make it any less of a TV commercial.

02:50.500 --> 02:52.500
The miracle of fish oil,

02:52.500 --> 02:54.000
man, we appreciate this.

02:54.000 --> 02:55.000
This book is available now.

02:55.000 --> 02:57.000
The Omega Zone, a miracle of the

02:57.000 --> 02:59.000
RX of high dose fish oil.

02:59.000 --> 03:01.000
It's a bloody miracle!

03:01.000 --> 03:03.000
You have what, fourteen patents on stuff?

03:03.000 --> 03:05.000
Yes.

03:05.000 --> 03:08.000
Never heard of anyone taking out patents on a miracle.

03:08.000 --> 03:11.000
So I spent a bit of time looking for a real miracle,

03:11.000 --> 03:14.000
like three men walking inside a fiery furnace.

03:14.000 --> 03:16.000
Then I found it.

03:16.000 --> 03:19.000
I asked a Catholic on my channel forum

03:19.000 --> 03:21.000
to give me the very best example of a miracle.

03:21.500 --> 03:23.500
And he said, that's easy.

03:23.500 --> 03:25.500
The rosary miracle of Hiroshima.

03:25.500 --> 03:27.500
The what now?

03:27.500 --> 03:30.500
Surely I'd heard of the rosary miracle of Hiroshima,

03:30.500 --> 03:34.500
eight Jesuits who survived the atomic bombing in 1945.

03:34.500 --> 03:37.500
Apparently it's famous in Catholic circles

03:37.500 --> 03:40.500
as one of the best examples of a modern day miracle.

03:40.500 --> 03:42.500
Here's how it goes.

03:42.500 --> 03:46.500
The blast wave was found as far away as 37 miles.

03:46.500 --> 03:49.500
Two thirds of the city's buildings were destroyed.

03:50.000 --> 03:52.000
Although no official figure exists,

03:52.000 --> 03:56.000
it is estimated that between 80,000 to 140,000 people

03:56.000 --> 03:59.000
were killed instantly in the blast.

03:59.000 --> 04:01.000
The hundreds of fires,

04:01.000 --> 04:03.000
ignited by the thermal pulse,

04:03.000 --> 04:05.000
combined to produce a firestorm

04:05.000 --> 04:07.000
that incinerated everything

04:07.000 --> 04:10.000
within 4.4 miles of ground zero.

04:20.000 --> 04:24.000
Yet incredibly less than a half mile away from ground zero,

04:24.000 --> 04:28.000
eight German Jesuit priests staggered out of their home,

04:28.000 --> 04:31.000
one of the few buildings still standing in that area,

04:31.000 --> 04:33.000
with only relatively minor injury.

04:33.000 --> 04:35.000
Later, all eight of these men

04:35.000 --> 04:38.000
would be examined by U.S. Army medical experts,

04:38.000 --> 04:41.000
along with the other survivors of the blast.

04:41.000 --> 04:43.000
According to these medical reports,

04:43.000 --> 04:45.000
the Jesuit priests suffered no signs

04:45.000 --> 04:47.000
of the explosion of the blast.

04:47.000 --> 04:48.500
According to these medical reports,

04:48.500 --> 04:51.500
the Jesuit priests suffered no signs of elevated radiation

04:51.500 --> 04:53.500
or indeed any of the other ill effects

04:53.500 --> 04:56.500
experienced by the other survivors.

04:56.500 --> 04:58.500
Speaking on behalf of all eight men,

04:58.500 --> 05:00.500
30 year old Father Hubert Schiffer

05:00.500 --> 05:02.500
had only one explanation.

05:02.500 --> 05:05.500
We believe that we survived

05:05.500 --> 05:08.500
because we were living the message of Fatima.

05:08.500 --> 05:12.500
Wow, take that Shadrach, Meshach and Abednego.

05:12.500 --> 05:14.500
You only survived a fiery furnace.

05:14.500 --> 05:17.000
These eight priests stood in front of an exploding

05:17.000 --> 05:21.000
nuclear-frigging bomb and weren't even hurt.

05:21.000 --> 05:23.500
After it was over, Father Hubert Schiffer

05:23.500 --> 05:26.500
relayed the story to another priest who reported,

05:26.500 --> 05:29.000
The only physical harm to himself

05:29.000 --> 05:31.000
was that he could feel a few pieces of glass

05:31.000 --> 05:32.500
in the back of his neck.

05:32.500 --> 05:34.000
As far as he could tell,

05:34.000 --> 05:37.000
there was nothing else physically wrong with himself.

05:37.000 --> 05:40.000
All eight priests went on to live out their days in full health

05:40.000 --> 05:43.500
with no cancer or side effects from radiation.

05:43.500 --> 05:45.500
And of course, priests don't lie.

05:45.500 --> 05:48.000
Their residence should have been utterly destroyed.

05:48.000 --> 05:50.000
Severe lung and heart damage,

05:50.000 --> 05:52.000
heads blown off, skulls crushed,

05:52.000 --> 05:54.000
cotton clothes catching fire.

05:54.000 --> 05:56.500
There are no physical laws to explain

05:56.500 --> 06:00.500
why the Jesuits were untouched in the Hiroshima air blast.

06:00.500 --> 06:03.000
They received enough radiation to be dead

06:03.000 --> 06:05.000
within at most a matter of minutes.

06:05.000 --> 06:08.000
What happened to those Jesuits at Hiroshima

06:08.000 --> 06:11.000
still defies all human logic.

06:11.000 --> 06:13.000
The story is not only in blogs,

06:13.000 --> 06:15.500
it's been written up in the Catholic News Agency

06:15.500 --> 06:17.500
and in the Catholic Herald,

06:17.500 --> 06:20.500
which tells us practically everything was vaporized

06:20.500 --> 06:22.500
within a mile of the point of impact,

06:22.500 --> 06:26.000
and yet the eight priests escaped virtually unscathed.

06:26.000 --> 06:29.500
And yes, they say this is just like the three biblical figures

06:29.500 --> 06:31.500
thrown into the fiery furnace.

06:31.500 --> 06:34.000
The miracle is even used to sell rosaries.

06:34.000 --> 06:35.500
Same story again.

06:35.500 --> 06:38.500
Eight priests who prayed to the rosary every day,

06:38.500 --> 06:41.000
just eight blocks from the atomic explosion,

06:41.000 --> 06:44.000
minor injuries, no radiation sickness.

06:44.000 --> 06:45.500
So buy a rosary,

06:45.500 --> 06:48.500
and you too can survive a nuclear bomb.

06:48.500 --> 06:50.500
Well, I'm convinced.

06:50.500 --> 06:52.500
Unless, of course, miracles are just real

06:52.500 --> 06:54.500
and easily explained events

06:54.500 --> 06:57.500
that then become grossly exaggerated.

06:57.500 --> 06:59.500
As you know, the first thing to ask

06:59.500 --> 07:01.500
when you hear something extraordinary is,

07:01.500 --> 07:03.500
what's your source?

07:03.500 --> 07:07.000
The miracle account gives us the names of the eight priests,

07:07.000 --> 07:09.500
so that's a starting point.

07:09.500 --> 07:11.000
I tracked down the source

07:11.000 --> 07:13.000
to an original report of the incident

07:13.000 --> 07:15.000
and the one that seems to have publicized it

07:15.000 --> 07:17.000
the most at the time.

07:17.000 --> 07:21.000
This New Yorker magazine article dated August 1946,

07:21.000 --> 07:23.000
a year after the Hiroshima bombing,

07:23.000 --> 07:25.000
quickly sold out of newsstands

07:25.000 --> 07:27.000
and was made into a book.

07:27.000 --> 07:29.000
The author, John Hersey,

07:29.000 --> 07:31.000
interviewed six survivors at the bombing

07:31.000 --> 07:33.000
who recounted what happened to them

07:33.000 --> 07:35.000
and the people around them.

07:35.000 --> 07:39.000
Only one was a Catholic priest, Father Kleinsauger,

07:39.000 --> 07:41.500
and although surviving an atomic bomb explosion

07:41.500 --> 07:43.500
is a remarkable story,

07:43.500 --> 07:45.500
his experience was no more remarkable

07:45.500 --> 07:47.500
than any of the other five survivors

07:47.500 --> 07:49.500
interviewed by Hersey,

07:49.500 --> 07:51.500
all of whom were Japanese

07:51.500 --> 07:53.500
and only one a Christian.

07:53.500 --> 07:57.500
Hersey never singled out Kleinsauger's story as exceptional

07:57.500 --> 07:59.500
and there was no mention of a miracle.

07:59.500 --> 08:02.500
But perhaps because Kleinsauger was Caucasian,

08:02.500 --> 08:05.500
the story of the priest grabbed people's attention.

08:05.500 --> 08:08.500
Another of them, Father John Simms,

08:08.500 --> 08:12.000
gave an interview detailing his own story of survival.

08:12.000 --> 08:15.000
But as I investigated some of the details,

08:15.000 --> 08:17.000
a few things didn't add up.

08:17.000 --> 08:19.000
Let's start with the primary source,

08:19.000 --> 08:21.000
the New Yorker story.

08:21.000 --> 08:23.500
Father Kleinsauger told the New Yorker

08:23.500 --> 08:25.000
that he and his fellow priests

08:25.000 --> 08:27.000
were staying at a downtown mission house

08:27.000 --> 08:30.000
in Noboricho, about 1,400 yards

08:30.000 --> 08:32.000
from the centre of the explosion.

08:32.000 --> 08:34.000
That's about 0.8 miles.

08:34.000 --> 08:36.500
Here's Noboricho and the first thing you notice

08:36.500 --> 08:38.500
is that it's nearer to the edge

08:38.500 --> 08:41.500
than the centre of that one-mile destruction zone.

08:41.500 --> 08:45.000
But okay, still a dangerous place to be.

08:45.000 --> 08:47.000
Then it turns out that although houses

08:47.000 --> 08:49.000
all around them were flattened in the blast,

08:49.000 --> 08:51.500
the mission house had been double-braced

08:51.500 --> 08:54.000
to withstand powerful earthquakes.

08:54.000 --> 08:56.000
And far from being vaporised,

08:56.000 --> 08:59.000
there were lots of survivors in the blast zone.

08:59.000 --> 09:01.000
But unlike the mission house,

09:01.000 --> 09:03.000
their homes weren't reinforced.

09:03.000 --> 09:06.000
So many were trapped under collapsed houses.

09:06.000 --> 09:08.000
They didn't die because of the blast.

09:08.000 --> 09:10.500
They died later when fires spread.

09:10.500 --> 09:12.500
Others who survived in the streets

09:12.500 --> 09:14.000
tried to put out the fires

09:14.000 --> 09:16.000
or ran towards the river.

09:16.000 --> 09:18.500
So clearly the priests weren't the only survivors

09:18.500 --> 09:20.000
walking around.

09:20.000 --> 09:23.000
The New Yorker doesn't give figures for survival rates

09:23.000 --> 09:25.500
so I checked a 1956 study titled

09:25.500 --> 09:28.500
Medical Effects of the Atomic Bomb in Japan.

09:28.500 --> 09:30.500
In the zone that priests were in,

09:30.500 --> 09:33.500
the survival rate was 48.4%.

09:33.500 --> 09:37.000
In other words, half the people there survived.

09:37.000 --> 09:39.000
But even in a reinforced house

09:39.000 --> 09:40.500
that can withstand the blast,

09:40.500 --> 09:42.500
still a miracle that all eight

09:42.500 --> 09:46.000
survived completely unscathed, right?

09:46.000 --> 09:48.000
But again, the priests told the New Yorker

09:48.000 --> 09:50.000
a different story.

09:50.000 --> 09:52.000
According to Kleinzauger's account,

09:52.000 --> 09:55.000
at least two priests were seriously injured.

09:55.000 --> 09:56.500
Blood was spurting from a wound

09:56.500 --> 09:58.500
in Father Schiffer's head.

09:58.500 --> 10:00.500
Lying on the ground, he whispered,

10:00.500 --> 10:03.500
It's as if I were already dead.

10:03.500 --> 10:07.000
Father Superior LaSalle was covered in blood.

10:07.000 --> 10:09.500
Only Father Kleinzauger and Father Cieslik

10:09.500 --> 10:11.000
escaped with minor injuries,

10:11.000 --> 10:13.500
according to the New Yorker account.

10:13.500 --> 10:15.000
In Father Cieslik's case,

10:15.000 --> 10:17.000
not because he prayed on his rosary

10:17.000 --> 10:18.500
and hoped for a miracle,

10:18.500 --> 10:20.000
but because he had the foresight

10:20.000 --> 10:22.000
to take refuge under a doorway,

10:22.000 --> 10:25.000
one of the strongest parts of the house.

10:25.000 --> 10:27.000
And the New Yorker account is corroborated

10:27.000 --> 10:29.000
by the priests themselves.

10:29.000 --> 10:32.000
According to a written account by Father John Simms,

10:32.000 --> 10:35.000
Father Schiffer is on the ground pale as a ghost.

10:35.000 --> 10:37.500
He has a deep incised wound behind the ear

10:37.500 --> 10:39.000
and has lost so much blood

10:39.000 --> 10:42.500
that we're concerned about his chances for survival.

10:42.500 --> 10:44.000
The Father Superior has suffered

10:44.000 --> 10:46.000
a deep wound of the lower leg.

10:46.000 --> 10:48.000
Father Cieslik and Father Kleinzauger

10:48.000 --> 10:51.500
have minor injuries but are completely exhausted.

10:51.500 --> 10:54.000
So that accounts for four of the priests,

10:54.000 --> 10:56.500
but what about the other four?

10:56.500 --> 10:58.000
Well, the reason they weren't part

10:58.000 --> 11:00.000
of the New Yorker story is because

11:00.000 --> 11:02.000
they were in a separate building.

11:02.000 --> 11:04.500
We'll let the US Army film about Father Simms

11:04.500 --> 11:06.500
tell that part of the story.

11:06.500 --> 11:09.000
Between Zero Point and the main building

11:09.000 --> 11:11.500
of the novitiate of Jesuits, four miles away...

11:11.500 --> 11:13.500
Hang on, four miles away?

11:13.500 --> 11:15.500
...was a hill which served to lessen

11:15.500 --> 11:16.500
the intensity of the blast.

11:16.500 --> 11:18.500
Now there's a hill between the main building

11:18.500 --> 11:20.500
and the blast site four miles away?

11:20.500 --> 11:23.000
Yes, it turns out the other four priests

11:23.000 --> 11:24.500
weren't even in Hiroshima

11:24.500 --> 11:26.500
at the time the bomb was dropped.

11:26.500 --> 11:28.500
In his written account, Father Simms said

11:28.500 --> 11:30.500
the building was in Nangatsuke,

11:30.500 --> 11:32.000
up a valley going into the mountains

11:32.000 --> 11:36.000
about two kilometres from the edge of the city.

11:36.000 --> 11:37.000
But there's one hope left

11:37.000 --> 11:40.000
for this increasingly shaky miracle.

11:40.000 --> 11:42.000
What about the fact that the four priests

11:42.000 --> 11:45.000
escaped any kind of radiation sickness?

11:45.000 --> 11:47.500
The religious sources say they were examined

11:47.500 --> 11:50.000
by doctors hundreds of times.

11:50.000 --> 11:52.500
Problem is, none of the religious sources

11:52.500 --> 11:56.000
cites a single medical report to substantiate this

11:56.000 --> 11:58.500
and the only medical examination I could find

11:58.500 --> 12:00.500
was of two of the priests,

12:00.500 --> 12:02.500
as reported by Father Simms.

12:02.500 --> 12:04.500
He tells a different story.

12:04.500 --> 12:07.000
Father Kleinzorger and Father Cieslik,

12:07.000 --> 12:09.000
who were near the centre of the explosion

12:09.000 --> 12:11.000
but who did not suffer burns,

12:11.000 --> 12:15.000
became quite weak some 14 days after the explosion.

12:15.000 --> 12:18.500
The attending physician diagnosed it as leukopenia.

12:18.500 --> 12:20.500
Leukopenia is a decrease in the number

12:20.500 --> 12:22.000
of white blood cells,

12:22.000 --> 12:25.500
a classic symptom of radiation sickness.

12:25.500 --> 12:28.000
A retrospective by the New York Times

12:28.000 --> 12:31.000
reported in 1985 that Father Kleinzorger

12:31.000 --> 12:37.000
suffered from a classic case history of A-bomb sickness.

12:37.000 --> 12:40.000
The medical history of the other two priests isn't known

12:40.000 --> 12:44.500
but Father Schiffer died at either age 63 or 67,

12:44.500 --> 12:47.000
relatively young.

12:47.000 --> 12:49.000
So after a bit of fact-checking,

12:49.000 --> 12:51.000
how's the miracle doing?

12:51.000 --> 12:54.000
Yet incredibly, less than a half mile away from ground zero...

12:54.000 --> 12:56.500
More than half a mile away from ground zero...

12:56.500 --> 12:58.500
eight German Jesuit priests...

12:58.500 --> 13:00.500
four German Jesuit priests...

13:00.500 --> 13:02.000
staggered out of their home,

13:02.000 --> 13:04.500
one of the few buildings still standing in that area...

13:04.500 --> 13:07.000
because it had been double-braced and reinforced...

13:07.000 --> 13:09.000
with only relatively minor injuries...

13:09.000 --> 13:11.000
two of them with severe injuries.

13:11.000 --> 13:13.000
According to these medical reports,

13:13.000 --> 13:16.000
the Jesuit priests suffered no signs of elevated radiation

13:16.000 --> 13:19.000
or indeed any of the other ill effects experienced

13:19.000 --> 13:20.500
by the other survivors.

13:20.500 --> 13:23.000
At least two of the priests suffered radiation sickness

13:23.000 --> 13:25.500
and a third died in his mid-60s.

13:25.500 --> 13:27.500
Speaking on behalf of all eight men,

13:27.500 --> 13:32.000
30-year-old Father Hubert Schiffer had only one explanation.

13:32.000 --> 13:34.500
We believe that we survived

13:34.500 --> 13:37.500
because we were living the message of Fatima.

13:37.500 --> 13:41.500
Or you survived because half of the people in your area also survived.

13:41.500 --> 13:44.000
In fact, two of the priests fared even worse

13:44.000 --> 13:47.000
than 2,500 Japanese residents

13:47.000 --> 13:50.000
in the same damage zone who escaped injury.

13:50.000 --> 13:53.500
For some reason, these are not called miracles.

13:53.500 --> 13:57.000
So how do atheists explain this so-called miracle?

13:57.000 --> 13:58.000
Very easily.

13:58.000 --> 14:00.500
By simply checking the records,

14:00.500 --> 14:04.500
something we can't do with alleged miracles from the Bronze Age.

14:04.500 --> 14:06.500
The more interesting question is

14:06.500 --> 14:08.500
how was this miracle fabricated

14:08.500 --> 14:11.000
out of something that's so well documented

14:11.000 --> 14:13.000
and easily fact-checked?

14:13.000 --> 14:16.000
In 1953, Father Schiffer wrote a booklet

14:16.000 --> 14:19.500
in which he linked his survival to praying with the rosary.

14:19.500 --> 14:21.500
He named the four priests involved

14:21.500 --> 14:24.000
and mentioned only that they were wounded.

14:24.000 --> 14:26.500
23 years on, Schiffer gave an interview

14:26.500 --> 14:29.000
about the incident to Father Paul Ruger

14:29.000 --> 14:32.500
at the 1976 Eucharist Congress in Philadelphia.

14:32.500 --> 14:34.000
He attributed his survival

14:34.000 --> 14:36.000
not to the reinforcement of the house

14:36.000 --> 14:39.000
but because we were living the message of Fatima.

14:39.000 --> 14:43.000
We lived and prayed the rosary daily in that home.

14:43.000 --> 14:45.500
And he downplayed his injuries even more.

14:45.500 --> 14:48.000
Now it was just a few pieces of glass

14:48.000 --> 14:49.500
in the back of his neck

14:49.500 --> 14:51.500
and nothing else physically wrong.

14:51.500 --> 14:53.500
So the progression of this miracle

14:53.500 --> 14:56.000
is that we go from a priest who's on the ground

14:56.000 --> 14:58.000
pale as a ghost, whispering that he feels

14:58.000 --> 15:00.000
as if he's already dead,

15:00.000 --> 15:01.500
to one who's wounded,

15:01.500 --> 15:04.000
then nothing wrong except a fragment of glass,

15:04.000 --> 15:06.000
to completely unscathed.

15:06.000 --> 15:08.500
Tis but a scratch. A scratch!

15:08.500 --> 15:11.000
This is more than just debunking a silly myth.

15:11.000 --> 15:13.000
It shows how an easily explained event

15:13.000 --> 15:15.500
can be embellished, exaggerated, altered,

15:15.500 --> 15:17.500
and turned into a miracle.

15:17.500 --> 15:19.500
As long as those who want to believe it

15:19.500 --> 15:21.000
don't fact-check it.

15:21.000 --> 15:23.000
If this had happened 2,000 years ago

15:23.000 --> 15:25.000
it would have made it into the Bible

15:25.000 --> 15:27.000
instead of the Catholic Herald.

15:27.000 --> 15:29.500
And with all the documentary evidence lost

15:29.500 --> 15:32.000
it would be cited as another miracle

15:32.000 --> 15:33.500
that science can't explain,

15:33.500 --> 15:36.500
just like the three men in the fiery furnace.

15:36.500 --> 15:38.500
The Catholic Herald is right.

15:38.500 --> 15:40.000
The story of the eight priests surviving

15:40.000 --> 15:42.500
an atomic bomb explosion unscathed

15:42.500 --> 15:45.000
is exactly like the story of three men

15:45.000 --> 15:47.500
walking around in a fiery furnace.

15:47.500 --> 15:49.500
Get it?

15:49.500 --> 15:52.500
Few modern-day miracles have drawn bigger crowds

15:52.500 --> 15:54.500
than this recurring one.

15:54.500 --> 15:56.000
It goes like this.

15:56.000 --> 15:57.000
God says,

15:57.000 --> 15:59.000
I think I'll perform a few miracles.

15:59.000 --> 16:02.000
Should I cure the kids in a cancer ward overnight?

16:02.000 --> 16:03.000
Nah.

16:03.000 --> 16:05.000
Regrow the limbs of an amputee.

16:05.000 --> 16:08.000
How about making crops miraculously grow

16:08.000 --> 16:10.000
in a drought-stricken area?

16:10.000 --> 16:11.000
Puh.

16:11.000 --> 16:12.000
I know.

16:12.000 --> 16:14.000
I'll make a statue cry.

16:14.000 --> 16:16.500
That will be really useful.

16:16.500 --> 16:20.000
And it was so popular he did it again and again.

16:20.000 --> 16:21.500
These days it seems to be a miracle

16:21.500 --> 16:25.000
when a church doesn't produce a weeping Madonna.

16:25.000 --> 16:27.000
There's so much competition

16:27.000 --> 16:30.000
that your Madonna now has to do more than just weep.

16:30.000 --> 16:32.500
This one sheds tears of blood.

16:32.500 --> 16:33.500
The only problem is

16:33.500 --> 16:36.500
this isn't a difficult miracle to perform.

16:36.500 --> 16:38.000
Most statues are hollow,

16:38.000 --> 16:39.500
made of porous plaster,

16:39.500 --> 16:41.500
and glazed on the outside.

16:41.500 --> 16:43.500
If you fill the inside with water

16:43.500 --> 16:45.500
it seeps through the plaster,

16:45.500 --> 16:47.500
but because the glaze is waterproof

16:47.500 --> 16:49.500
the water just stays where it is,

16:49.500 --> 16:51.500
like filling a cup.

16:51.500 --> 16:53.000
But if you scratch away the glaze

16:53.000 --> 16:55.000
where you want the water to come out,

16:55.000 --> 16:56.500
like under the eyes,

16:56.500 --> 16:57.500
presto,

16:57.500 --> 16:59.000
a weeping Madonna.

16:59.000 --> 17:00.000
This is so easy

17:00.000 --> 17:01.500
that you don't even need to struggle

17:01.500 --> 17:03.500
through the crowds to see it.

17:03.500 --> 17:06.000
You can make your own graven image at home.

17:06.000 --> 17:08.000
Invite your friends.

17:08.000 --> 17:10.000
And as congregations begin to tire

17:10.000 --> 17:11.500
of weeping Madonnas,

17:11.500 --> 17:14.000
slice things up a bit by using red dye.

17:14.000 --> 17:16.000
Or scratch glaze off the nipple area

17:16.000 --> 17:17.500
rather than the eyes,

17:17.500 --> 17:19.500
then fill the statue with milk.

17:19.500 --> 17:22.500
Amaze the faithful with your novelty suckling Madonna.

17:22.500 --> 17:24.000
It's a bloody miracle!

17:24.000 --> 17:26.000
Miracles don't just happen in Christianity,

17:26.000 --> 17:27.000
of course,

17:27.000 --> 17:29.000
Islam is full of them.

17:29.000 --> 17:30.000
But I couldn't find anything

17:30.000 --> 17:32.000
to compete with the simple magic tricks

17:32.000 --> 17:34.000
or well-documented fabrications

17:34.000 --> 17:36.000
of the Christian church.

17:36.000 --> 17:38.500
Muslims do this the way we saw at the beginning.

17:38.500 --> 17:39.500
Take an ordinary,

17:39.500 --> 17:41.000
easily explained event

17:41.000 --> 17:43.500
and simply declare it to be a miracle.

17:43.500 --> 17:45.500
How can anyone prove it isn't?

17:45.500 --> 17:47.500
All these supposed miracles

17:47.500 --> 17:49.000
came from a video called

17:49.000 --> 17:50.500
Top Ten Miracles.

17:50.500 --> 17:52.500
And what was their number one?

17:52.500 --> 17:55.500
This, I know, looks very ordinary,

17:55.500 --> 17:57.500
but Allah has written his name,

17:57.500 --> 17:58.500
this name,

17:58.500 --> 18:00.500
somewhere in this picture.

18:00.500 --> 18:02.000
Can you match the name

18:02.000 --> 18:03.500
to the geographical feature?

18:03.500 --> 18:05.000
Pause the video

18:05.000 --> 18:07.500
and give yourself 30 seconds to find it.

18:07.500 --> 18:09.500
OK, time's up.

18:09.500 --> 18:11.000
According to the video,

18:11.000 --> 18:12.000
it's here.

18:12.000 --> 18:13.500
And this, remember,

18:13.500 --> 18:15.000
is the top miracle

18:15.000 --> 18:18.000
out of the top ten miracles.

18:18.000 --> 18:20.000
My advice to Muslims is

18:20.000 --> 18:22.000
don't try to compete with Christians

18:22.000 --> 18:24.500
when it comes to finding symbols of your religion

18:24.500 --> 18:26.000
in natural patterns.

18:26.000 --> 18:28.000
You have to find this.

18:28.000 --> 18:30.500
All they have to do is find this.

18:30.500 --> 18:31.500
And believe me,

18:31.500 --> 18:32.500
that's so easy,

18:32.500 --> 18:34.000
they see it everywhere.

18:34.000 --> 18:37.000
...laminin protein molecule.

18:37.000 --> 18:39.000
It looks just like this.

18:40.000 --> 18:42.500
They still don't give a flying f**k, do they?

18:42.500 --> 18:45.000
The perfect shape

18:45.000 --> 18:48.000
of the cross of our Lord Jesus Christ.

18:48.000 --> 18:49.500
Nah.

18:49.500 --> 18:50.500
Even I can spot

18:50.500 --> 18:53.000
a couple of very obvious crosses right here.

18:53.000 --> 18:54.500
But that's because you can find

18:54.500 --> 18:57.500
pretty much anything you want to find in this picture,

18:57.500 --> 18:59.000
including the golden arches

18:59.000 --> 19:01.000
of our Lord and Saviour, Ronald McDonald.

19:01.000 --> 19:03.500
It didn't rise, there it is!

19:04.500 --> 19:06.000
Tuck us all!

19:06.000 --> 19:07.000
Believe!

19:07.000 --> 19:08.000
Did you see it, Doctor?

19:08.000 --> 19:09.000
No.

19:09.000 --> 19:11.500
Into my galvanised pressure cooker!

19:11.500 --> 19:13.000
There's no miracle!

19:13.000 --> 19:14.000
Poor God.

19:14.000 --> 19:15.500
He just can't get a break

19:15.500 --> 19:18.500
in this cynical fact-checking scientific age.

19:18.500 --> 19:20.500
The nearest thing we have to miracles these days

19:20.500 --> 19:22.000
are magic tricks,

19:22.000 --> 19:23.500
and they're far more astonishing
