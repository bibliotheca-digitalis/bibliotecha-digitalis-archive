0	3200	All right, if you're God, reveal your Godhead.
3200	5200	No, no, no, no.
5200	8200	A miracle. Show us a miracle.
8200	9700	Here's a miracle.
9700	10700	Why?
10700	12700	This hand.
12700	14700	No, I don't mean that sort of miracle.
14700	17700	I mean a proper miracle, like the loaves and the fishes.
17700	20200	Yes, they were proper miracles.
20200	23200	Ask answers in Genesis to name their top miracles,
23200	25200	and this is what they give you.
25200	27000	The parting of the Red Sea,
27000	29000	Jesus coming back to life,
29000	31000	and Jesus walking on water.
31000	32700	Their conclusion?
32700	35700	Natural explanations, in other words science,
35700	38700	can't account for any of these miracles.
38700	41200	But science also can't explain how Athena
41200	43700	sprang fully armoured from the head of Zeus.
43700	46700	It can't explain how looking at Medusa's face
46700	48700	turned people into stone.
48700	51200	Maybe the problem isn't science.
51200	54700	Maybe it's the veracity of these ancient stories.
55700	58500	So if these were proper miracles,
58500	61000	how can we never see any of them today?
61000	63000	Like the loaves and the fishes,
63000	66000	or the miracle of Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego,
66000	68500	who were thrown into a fiery furnace
68500	72000	and yet walked around inside the flames unharmed.
72000	75000	Instead of raising Lazarus,
75000	77000	I'll raise you a table.
77000	79000	What? That table?
79000	81000	Ten feet.
81000	83000	Rise up.
83000	85000	Slowly.
85000	87000	Lonely.
87500	89500	Rise up.
90500	92500	One foot.
92500	94500	Two.
94500	96500	Three.
96500	98500	Four.
98500	100500	Slowly.
100500	102500	Slowly.
102500	104500	Five.
104500	106500	Six.
106500	108500	Seven.
108500	110500	Eight.
110500	112500	Nine.
112500	114500	Ten.
114500	118000	The table floats ten feet in space.
118000	120000	I think it's a bloody miracle.
120000	123000	I once asked a Christian to give me an example
123000	125000	of a modern day miracle.
125000	127000	And he said, a sunset.
127000	129000	Look, it's beautiful.
129000	131000	A miracle of God's creation.
131000	135000	But miracles are supposed to defy natural explanation.
135000	137000	A sunset is a gaseous body of hydrogen
137000	140000	fusing into helium under gravitational pressure,
140000	142000	emitting white light which gets scattered
142000	144000	in the atmosphere as the Earth rotates
144000	146000	so that we predominantly see the longer
146000	149500	wavelength bands of the electromagnetic spectrum.
149500	151500	Then we have the miracle of people surviving
151500	153500	plane crashes and avalanches.
153500	157500	And again, these have perfectly natural explanations.
157500	159500	It would be a strange world indeed
159500	163500	if people never survived air crashes and avalanches.
163500	165500	And word to Pat Robertson,
165500	167500	just calling fish oil a miracle
167500	170500	doesn't make it any less of a TV commercial.
170500	172500	The miracle of fish oil,
172500	174000	man, we appreciate this.
174000	175000	This book is available now.
175000	177000	The Omega Zone, a miracle of the
177000	179000	RX of high dose fish oil.
179000	181000	It's a bloody miracle!
181000	183000	You have what, fourteen patents on stuff?
183000	185000	Yes.
185000	188000	Never heard of anyone taking out patents on a miracle.
188000	191000	So I spent a bit of time looking for a real miracle,
191000	194000	like three men walking inside a fiery furnace.
194000	196000	Then I found it.
196000	199000	I asked a Catholic on my channel forum
199000	201000	to give me the very best example of a miracle.
201500	203500	And he said, that's easy.
203500	205500	The rosary miracle of Hiroshima.
205500	207500	The what now?
207500	210500	Surely I'd heard of the rosary miracle of Hiroshima,
210500	214500	eight Jesuits who survived the atomic bombing in 1945.
214500	217500	Apparently it's famous in Catholic circles
217500	220500	as one of the best examples of a modern day miracle.
220500	222500	Here's how it goes.
222500	226500	The blast wave was found as far away as 37 miles.
226500	229500	Two thirds of the city's buildings were destroyed.
230000	232000	Although no official figure exists,
232000	236000	it is estimated that between 80,000 to 140,000 people
236000	239000	were killed instantly in the blast.
239000	241000	The hundreds of fires,
241000	243000	ignited by the thermal pulse,
243000	245000	combined to produce a firestorm
245000	247000	that incinerated everything
247000	250000	within 4.4 miles of ground zero.
260000	264000	Yet incredibly less than a half mile away from ground zero,
264000	268000	eight German Jesuit priests staggered out of their home,
268000	271000	one of the few buildings still standing in that area,
271000	273000	with only relatively minor injury.
273000	275000	Later, all eight of these men
275000	278000	would be examined by U.S. Army medical experts,
278000	281000	along with the other survivors of the blast.
281000	283000	According to these medical reports,
283000	285000	the Jesuit priests suffered no signs
285000	287000	of the explosion of the blast.
287000	288500	According to these medical reports,
288500	291500	the Jesuit priests suffered no signs of elevated radiation
291500	293500	or indeed any of the other ill effects
293500	296500	experienced by the other survivors.
296500	298500	Speaking on behalf of all eight men,
298500	300500	30 year old Father Hubert Schiffer
300500	302500	had only one explanation.
302500	305500	We believe that we survived
305500	308500	because we were living the message of Fatima.
308500	312500	Wow, take that Shadrach, Meshach and Abednego.
312500	314500	You only survived a fiery furnace.
314500	317000	These eight priests stood in front of an exploding
317000	321000	nuclear-frigging bomb and weren't even hurt.
321000	323500	After it was over, Father Hubert Schiffer
323500	326500	relayed the story to another priest who reported,
326500	329000	The only physical harm to himself
329000	331000	was that he could feel a few pieces of glass
331000	332500	in the back of his neck.
332500	334000	As far as he could tell,
334000	337000	there was nothing else physically wrong with himself.
337000	340000	All eight priests went on to live out their days in full health
340000	343500	with no cancer or side effects from radiation.
343500	345500	And of course, priests don't lie.
345500	348000	Their residence should have been utterly destroyed.
348000	350000	Severe lung and heart damage,
350000	352000	heads blown off, skulls crushed,
352000	354000	cotton clothes catching fire.
354000	356500	There are no physical laws to explain
356500	360500	why the Jesuits were untouched in the Hiroshima air blast.
360500	363000	They received enough radiation to be dead
363000	365000	within at most a matter of minutes.
365000	368000	What happened to those Jesuits at Hiroshima
368000	371000	still defies all human logic.
371000	373000	The story is not only in blogs,
373000	375500	it's been written up in the Catholic News Agency
375500	377500	and in the Catholic Herald,
377500	380500	which tells us practically everything was vaporized
380500	382500	within a mile of the point of impact,
382500	386000	and yet the eight priests escaped virtually unscathed.
386000	389500	And yes, they say this is just like the three biblical figures
389500	391500	thrown into the fiery furnace.
391500	394000	The miracle is even used to sell rosaries.
394000	395500	Same story again.
395500	398500	Eight priests who prayed to the rosary every day,
398500	401000	just eight blocks from the atomic explosion,
401000	404000	minor injuries, no radiation sickness.
404000	405500	So buy a rosary,
405500	408500	and you too can survive a nuclear bomb.
408500	410500	Well, I'm convinced.
410500	412500	Unless, of course, miracles are just real
412500	414500	and easily explained events
414500	417500	that then become grossly exaggerated.
417500	419500	As you know, the first thing to ask
419500	421500	when you hear something extraordinary is,
421500	423500	what's your source?
423500	427000	The miracle account gives us the names of the eight priests,
427000	429500	so that's a starting point.
429500	431000	I tracked down the source
431000	433000	to an original report of the incident
433000	435000	and the one that seems to have publicized it
435000	437000	the most at the time.
437000	441000	This New Yorker magazine article dated August 1946,
441000	443000	a year after the Hiroshima bombing,
443000	445000	quickly sold out of newsstands
445000	447000	and was made into a book.
447000	449000	The author, John Hersey,
449000	451000	interviewed six survivors at the bombing
451000	453000	who recounted what happened to them
453000	455000	and the people around them.
455000	459000	Only one was a Catholic priest, Father Kleinsauger,
459000	461500	and although surviving an atomic bomb explosion
461500	463500	is a remarkable story,
463500	465500	his experience was no more remarkable
465500	467500	than any of the other five survivors
467500	469500	interviewed by Hersey,
469500	471500	all of whom were Japanese
471500	473500	and only one a Christian.
473500	477500	Hersey never singled out Kleinsauger's story as exceptional
477500	479500	and there was no mention of a miracle.
479500	482500	But perhaps because Kleinsauger was Caucasian,
482500	485500	the story of the priest grabbed people's attention.
485500	488500	Another of them, Father John Simms,
488500	492000	gave an interview detailing his own story of survival.
492000	495000	But as I investigated some of the details,
495000	497000	a few things didn't add up.
497000	499000	Let's start with the primary source,
499000	501000	the New Yorker story.
501000	503500	Father Kleinsauger told the New Yorker
503500	505000	that he and his fellow priests
505000	507000	were staying at a downtown mission house
507000	510000	in Noboricho, about 1,400 yards
510000	512000	from the centre of the explosion.
512000	514000	That's about 0.8 miles.
514000	516500	Here's Noboricho and the first thing you notice
516500	518500	is that it's nearer to the edge
518500	521500	than the centre of that one-mile destruction zone.
521500	525000	But okay, still a dangerous place to be.
525000	527000	Then it turns out that although houses
527000	529000	all around them were flattened in the blast,
529000	531500	the mission house had been double-braced
531500	534000	to withstand powerful earthquakes.
534000	536000	And far from being vaporised,
536000	539000	there were lots of survivors in the blast zone.
539000	541000	But unlike the mission house,
541000	543000	their homes weren't reinforced.
543000	546000	So many were trapped under collapsed houses.
546000	548000	They didn't die because of the blast.
548000	550500	They died later when fires spread.
550500	552500	Others who survived in the streets
552500	554000	tried to put out the fires
554000	556000	or ran towards the river.
556000	558500	So clearly the priests weren't the only survivors
558500	560000	walking around.
560000	563000	The New Yorker doesn't give figures for survival rates
563000	565500	so I checked a 1956 study titled
565500	568500	Medical Effects of the Atomic Bomb in Japan.
568500	570500	In the zone that priests were in,
570500	573500	the survival rate was 48.4%.
573500	577000	In other words, half the people there survived.
577000	579000	But even in a reinforced house
579000	580500	that can withstand the blast,
580500	582500	still a miracle that all eight
582500	586000	survived completely unscathed, right?
586000	588000	But again, the priests told the New Yorker
588000	590000	a different story.
590000	592000	According to Kleinzauger's account,
592000	595000	at least two priests were seriously injured.
595000	596500	Blood was spurting from a wound
596500	598500	in Father Schiffer's head.
598500	600500	Lying on the ground, he whispered,
600500	603500	It's as if I were already dead.
603500	607000	Father Superior LaSalle was covered in blood.
607000	609500	Only Father Kleinzauger and Father Cieslik
609500	611000	escaped with minor injuries,
611000	613500	according to the New Yorker account.
613500	615000	In Father Cieslik's case,
615000	617000	not because he prayed on his rosary
617000	618500	and hoped for a miracle,
618500	620000	but because he had the foresight
620000	622000	to take refuge under a doorway,
622000	625000	one of the strongest parts of the house.
625000	627000	And the New Yorker account is corroborated
627000	629000	by the priests themselves.
629000	632000	According to a written account by Father John Simms,
632000	635000	Father Schiffer is on the ground pale as a ghost.
635000	637500	He has a deep incised wound behind the ear
637500	639000	and has lost so much blood
639000	642500	that we're concerned about his chances for survival.
642500	644000	The Father Superior has suffered
644000	646000	a deep wound of the lower leg.
646000	648000	Father Cieslik and Father Kleinzauger
648000	651500	have minor injuries but are completely exhausted.
651500	654000	So that accounts for four of the priests,
654000	656500	but what about the other four?
656500	658000	Well, the reason they weren't part
658000	660000	of the New Yorker story is because
660000	662000	they were in a separate building.
662000	664500	We'll let the US Army film about Father Simms
664500	666500	tell that part of the story.
666500	669000	Between Zero Point and the main building
669000	671500	of the novitiate of Jesuits, four miles away...
671500	673500	Hang on, four miles away?
673500	675500	...was a hill which served to lessen
675500	676500	the intensity of the blast.
676500	678500	Now there's a hill between the main building
678500	680500	and the blast site four miles away?
680500	683000	Yes, it turns out the other four priests
683000	684500	weren't even in Hiroshima
684500	686500	at the time the bomb was dropped.
686500	688500	In his written account, Father Simms said
688500	690500	the building was in Nangatsuke,
690500	692000	up a valley going into the mountains
692000	696000	about two kilometres from the edge of the city.
696000	697000	But there's one hope left
697000	700000	for this increasingly shaky miracle.
700000	702000	What about the fact that the four priests
702000	705000	escaped any kind of radiation sickness?
705000	707500	The religious sources say they were examined
707500	710000	by doctors hundreds of times.
710000	712500	Problem is, none of the religious sources
712500	716000	cites a single medical report to substantiate this
716000	718500	and the only medical examination I could find
718500	720500	was of two of the priests,
720500	722500	as reported by Father Simms.
722500	724500	He tells a different story.
724500	727000	Father Kleinzorger and Father Cieslik,
727000	729000	who were near the centre of the explosion
729000	731000	but who did not suffer burns,
731000	735000	became quite weak some 14 days after the explosion.
735000	738500	The attending physician diagnosed it as leukopenia.
738500	740500	Leukopenia is a decrease in the number
740500	742000	of white blood cells,
742000	745500	a classic symptom of radiation sickness.
745500	748000	A retrospective by the New York Times
748000	751000	reported in 1985 that Father Kleinzorger
751000	757000	suffered from a classic case history of A-bomb sickness.
757000	760000	The medical history of the other two priests isn't known
760000	764500	but Father Schiffer died at either age 63 or 67,
764500	767000	relatively young.
767000	769000	So after a bit of fact-checking,
769000	771000	how's the miracle doing?
771000	774000	Yet incredibly, less than a half mile away from ground zero...
774000	776500	More than half a mile away from ground zero...
776500	778500	eight German Jesuit priests...
778500	780500	four German Jesuit priests...
780500	782000	staggered out of their home,
782000	784500	one of the few buildings still standing in that area...
784500	787000	because it had been double-braced and reinforced...
787000	789000	with only relatively minor injuries...
789000	791000	two of them with severe injuries.
791000	793000	According to these medical reports,
793000	796000	the Jesuit priests suffered no signs of elevated radiation
796000	799000	or indeed any of the other ill effects experienced
799000	800500	by the other survivors.
800500	803000	At least two of the priests suffered radiation sickness
803000	805500	and a third died in his mid-60s.
805500	807500	Speaking on behalf of all eight men,
807500	812000	30-year-old Father Hubert Schiffer had only one explanation.
812000	814500	We believe that we survived
814500	817500	because we were living the message of Fatima.
817500	821500	Or you survived because half of the people in your area also survived.
821500	824000	In fact, two of the priests fared even worse
824000	827000	than 2,500 Japanese residents
827000	830000	in the same damage zone who escaped injury.
830000	833500	For some reason, these are not called miracles.
833500	837000	So how do atheists explain this so-called miracle?
837000	838000	Very easily.
838000	840500	By simply checking the records,
840500	844500	something we can't do with alleged miracles from the Bronze Age.
844500	846500	The more interesting question is
846500	848500	how was this miracle fabricated
848500	851000	out of something that's so well documented
851000	853000	and easily fact-checked?
853000	856000	In 1953, Father Schiffer wrote a booklet
856000	859500	in which he linked his survival to praying with the rosary.
859500	861500	He named the four priests involved
861500	864000	and mentioned only that they were wounded.
864000	866500	23 years on, Schiffer gave an interview
866500	869000	about the incident to Father Paul Ruger
869000	872500	at the 1976 Eucharist Congress in Philadelphia.
872500	874000	He attributed his survival
874000	876000	not to the reinforcement of the house
876000	879000	but because we were living the message of Fatima.
879000	883000	We lived and prayed the rosary daily in that home.
883000	885500	And he downplayed his injuries even more.
885500	888000	Now it was just a few pieces of glass
888000	889500	in the back of his neck
889500	891500	and nothing else physically wrong.
891500	893500	So the progression of this miracle
893500	896000	is that we go from a priest who's on the ground
896000	898000	pale as a ghost, whispering that he feels
898000	900000	as if he's already dead,
900000	901500	to one who's wounded,
901500	904000	then nothing wrong except a fragment of glass,
904000	906000	to completely unscathed.
906000	908500	Tis but a scratch. A scratch!
908500	911000	This is more than just debunking a silly myth.
911000	913000	It shows how an easily explained event
913000	915500	can be embellished, exaggerated, altered,
915500	917500	and turned into a miracle.
917500	919500	As long as those who want to believe it
919500	921000	don't fact-check it.
921000	923000	If this had happened 2,000 years ago
923000	925000	it would have made it into the Bible
925000	927000	instead of the Catholic Herald.
927000	929500	And with all the documentary evidence lost
929500	932000	it would be cited as another miracle
932000	933500	that science can't explain,
933500	936500	just like the three men in the fiery furnace.
936500	938500	The Catholic Herald is right.
938500	940000	The story of the eight priests surviving
940000	942500	an atomic bomb explosion unscathed
942500	945000	is exactly like the story of three men
945000	947500	walking around in a fiery furnace.
947500	949500	Get it?
949500	952500	Few modern-day miracles have drawn bigger crowds
952500	954500	than this recurring one.
954500	956000	It goes like this.
956000	957000	God says,
957000	959000	I think I'll perform a few miracles.
959000	962000	Should I cure the kids in a cancer ward overnight?
962000	963000	Nah.
963000	965000	Regrow the limbs of an amputee.
965000	968000	How about making crops miraculously grow
968000	970000	in a drought-stricken area?
970000	971000	Puh.
971000	972000	I know.
972000	974000	I'll make a statue cry.
974000	976500	That will be really useful.
976500	980000	And it was so popular he did it again and again.
980000	981500	These days it seems to be a miracle
981500	985000	when a church doesn't produce a weeping Madonna.
985000	987000	There's so much competition
987000	990000	that your Madonna now has to do more than just weep.
990000	992500	This one sheds tears of blood.
992500	993500	The only problem is
993500	996500	this isn't a difficult miracle to perform.
996500	998000	Most statues are hollow,
998000	999500	made of porous plaster,
999500	1001500	and glazed on the outside.
1001500	1003500	If you fill the inside with water
1003500	1005500	it seeps through the plaster,
1005500	1007500	but because the glaze is waterproof
1007500	1009500	the water just stays where it is,
1009500	1011500	like filling a cup.
1011500	1013000	But if you scratch away the glaze
1013000	1015000	where you want the water to come out,
1015000	1016500	like under the eyes,
1016500	1017500	presto,
1017500	1019000	a weeping Madonna.
1019000	1020000	This is so easy
1020000	1021500	that you don't even need to struggle
1021500	1023500	through the crowds to see it.
1023500	1026000	You can make your own graven image at home.
1026000	1028000	Invite your friends.
1028000	1030000	And as congregations begin to tire
1030000	1031500	of weeping Madonnas,
1031500	1034000	slice things up a bit by using red dye.
1034000	1036000	Or scratch glaze off the nipple area
1036000	1037500	rather than the eyes,
1037500	1039500	then fill the statue with milk.
1039500	1042500	Amaze the faithful with your novelty suckling Madonna.
1042500	1044000	It's a bloody miracle!
1044000	1046000	Miracles don't just happen in Christianity,
1046000	1047000	of course,
1047000	1049000	Islam is full of them.
1049000	1050000	But I couldn't find anything
1050000	1052000	to compete with the simple magic tricks
1052000	1054000	or well-documented fabrications
1054000	1056000	of the Christian church.
1056000	1058500	Muslims do this the way we saw at the beginning.
1058500	1059500	Take an ordinary,
1059500	1061000	easily explained event
1061000	1063500	and simply declare it to be a miracle.
1063500	1065500	How can anyone prove it isn't?
1065500	1067500	All these supposed miracles
1067500	1069000	came from a video called
1069000	1070500	Top Ten Miracles.
1070500	1072500	And what was their number one?
1072500	1075500	This, I know, looks very ordinary,
1075500	1077500	but Allah has written his name,
1077500	1078500	this name,
1078500	1080500	somewhere in this picture.
1080500	1082000	Can you match the name
1082000	1083500	to the geographical feature?
1083500	1085000	Pause the video
1085000	1087500	and give yourself 30 seconds to find it.
1087500	1089500	OK, time's up.
1089500	1091000	According to the video,
1091000	1092000	it's here.
1092000	1093500	And this, remember,
1093500	1095000	is the top miracle
1095000	1098000	out of the top ten miracles.
1098000	1100000	My advice to Muslims is
1100000	1102000	don't try to compete with Christians
1102000	1104500	when it comes to finding symbols of your religion
1104500	1106000	in natural patterns.
1106000	1108000	You have to find this.
1108000	1110500	All they have to do is find this.
1110500	1111500	And believe me,
1111500	1112500	that's so easy,
1112500	1114000	they see it everywhere.
1114000	1117000	...laminin protein molecule.
1117000	1119000	It looks just like this.
1120000	1122500	They still don't give a flying f**k, do they?
1122500	1125000	The perfect shape
1125000	1128000	of the cross of our Lord Jesus Christ.
1128000	1129500	Nah.
1129500	1130500	Even I can spot
1130500	1133000	a couple of very obvious crosses right here.
1133000	1134500	But that's because you can find
1134500	1137500	pretty much anything you want to find in this picture,
1137500	1139000	including the golden arches
1139000	1141000	of our Lord and Saviour, Ronald McDonald.
1141000	1143500	It didn't rise, there it is!
1144500	1146000	Tuck us all!
1146000	1147000	Believe!
1147000	1148000	Did you see it, Doctor?
1148000	1149000	No.
1149000	1151500	Into my galvanised pressure cooker!
1151500	1153000	There's no miracle!
1153000	1154000	Poor God.
1154000	1155500	He just can't get a break
1155500	1158500	in this cynical fact-checking scientific age.
1158500	1160500	The nearest thing we have to miracles these days
1160500	1162000	are magic tricks,
1162000	1163500	and they're far more astonishing
1163500	1165500	than weeping statues
1165500	1167500	and squiggles in the sand.
