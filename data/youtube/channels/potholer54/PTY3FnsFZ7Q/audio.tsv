0	5440	Let's take Professor Richard Linden, for instance, who has produced paper after paper
5440	9560	showing that climate sensitivity is around a quarter to a seventh of what the Euro has
9560	13080	changed. That means three watts per square meter, all anthropogenic forcings estimated
13080	17460	by the IPCC, 0.8, five times as much forcing for natural causes.
17460	22380	The question I asked in my first video on Moncton is, why do people believe him? And
22380	27460	here we start to get an insight. Here he is on national television in Australia debating
27460	32660	a professional climate scientist and easily getting the better of him. You can tell Dr
32660	38500	Ben McNeill is thinking, shit, I thought this would be a pushover. I wish I'd prepared.
38500	42500	Yes, McNeill would have been wise to find out a bit more about Moncton and his arguments
42500	46740	before coming on the programme, because Moncton certainly did his homework on McNeill.
46740	51440	With all respect, you are not an expert on the central question in this debate, which
51440	56800	is climate sensitivity. How much warming will you get if you add CO2 to the atmosphere?
56800	61640	And he's right. McNeill isn't an expert on climate sensitivity. He's an expert on carbon
61640	66960	dioxide absorption in oceans, which is the subject of most of his research. So when Moncton
66960	72160	turns to an area outside of McNeill's expertise, Moncton can pretty well make any claim he
72160	77840	likes without fear of contradiction. Let's face it, he sounds bold, confident, eloquent
77840	82640	and sure of his assertions. McNeill can't check whether Moncton's claims are correct.
82640	87840	Neither can the interviewer. But we can. So that's exactly what we're going to do.
87840	93360	First, let me explain some terms that you'll hear a lot. Put simply, forcing is the amount
93360	98440	of warming caused by whatever might be warming the Earth. It could be the sun, or a greenhouse
98440	103840	gas or a light reflective surface turning into a darker one. The amount of forcing or
103840	109640	warming due to a doubling of CO2 levels is pretty much agreed on by all climatologists.
109640	114680	Richard Linson, the skeptic everyone likes to quote, says this figure is about 3.5 watts
114680	120680	per square metre, as noted in the last three IPCC scientific assessments. The IPCC actually
120680	125080	puts the figure at 3.7 watts per square metre, but there's a margin of error, so we're in
125080	130360	the same ballpark. When forcing increases, the average global surface temperature rises
130360	134560	until it reaches a stage where the amount of energy leaving the Earth is about the same
134560	139320	as the amount of energy being pumped in by the forcing. This is called the equilibrium
139320	144400	temperature and in its most basic form it's very easy to work out. Temperature equals
144400	149520	forcing times lambda, which is the Earth's sensitivity. It's usually written as delta
149520	155920	T to denote a change in temperature in response to delta F, a change in forcing. So forcing
155920	160880	is like a heater in a cabin, and sensitivity tells us the final temperature the cabin will
160880	165880	reach in response to that heat. It's important to understand the difference between forcing
165880	170920	and sensitivity, because as we'll see in a minute, Moncton gets them completely mixed
170920	177640	up. If no other factors are involved, climate sensitivity is about 0.27, so if we plug in
177640	183120	a forcing of 3.7 watts per square metre caused by a doubling of CO2, we'd get an increase
183120	188500	in temperature of about 1 degree centigrade. This is also generally agreed on by all climate
188500	194420	scientists. Unfortunately, other factors are involved. As the Earth warms towards this
194420	199340	level, changes happen that tend to amplify and reduce the warming, known as positive
199340	204940	and negative feedback. Lindsen argues that more water vapour will produce more clouds,
204940	210300	which reflect sunlight and may act as a negative feedback, outweighing all the positives. The
210300	215180	reason this isn't generally accepted is because other climatologists have found flaws in Lindsen's
215180	220720	hypothesis. For one thing, it only encompasses the tropics, not the whole Earth. And even
220720	225660	clouds in the tropics not only reflect sunlight and act as a negative feedback, they also
225660	231700	send outgoing longwave radiation back to Earth, and so act as a positive feedback. And the
231700	236100	other reason Lindsen's hypothesis doesn't fit is that researchers working in a completely
236100	241460	different field, geology, found that the feedback effects from CO2 in the past were clearly
241460	247000	positive, not negative. So these various feedbacks have to be plugged in to find out
247000	251700	what the Earth's sensitivity really is, and therefore what the equilibrium temperature
251700	257860	will be. Modelling is just one of many different ways sensitivity can be determined. Glaciologists
257860	262940	and geologists determine sensitivity by looking at how global temperatures changed according
262940	268260	to carbon dioxide level rises in the past. A review of the various results from a dozen
268260	273300	different methods, each denoted by a different colour, shows that nearly all cluster around
273300	279900	the 2 to 4.5 degree range. I'll squash them up so we can see them in one frame. The thicker
279900	285140	lines show more results and greater probability. Individual results that are well outside the
285140	291540	cluster, known as outliers, are marked with crosses. So let's just pick a result at random.
291540	296060	This study, for instance, shows that global temperatures will rise by 10 degrees because
296060	303220	of a doubling of CO2. And this one, for instance, says the same thing. So we now know that temperatures
303220	309540	will rise by 10 degrees, which is three times higher than the IPCC estimate. What do you
309540	315780	mean that's nonsense? Rats. The Moncton fans have spotted what I did. Yes, I completely
315780	320180	ignored the majority of results clustered in the middle and just happened to deliberately
320180	325000	pick the most extreme outliers. Then I pretended that they were representative of the body
325000	329700	of evidence and claimed that we know these results are correct. You could just as easily
329700	334240	pick a couple of studies from the opposite extreme and do the same thing. But who would
334240	339780	do something as obviously bogus as that? Let's take Professor Richard Linden, for instance,
339780	343900	who has produced paper after paper showing that climate sensitivity is around a quarter
343900	348460	to a second. So now we're beginning to see Moncton's performance in context. He cherry-picked
348460	353520	extremely low figures that are clearly outside the range of most research. Then he conveys
353520	358800	the impression that this result is correct, undisputed, known and settled. The biggest
358800	363040	problem is that a number of papers have found flaws in the research of Lindsen, Douglas
363040	369400	and Knox and Moncton makes no mention of this. Here's my own calculation and we get 1.6 degrees
369400	375880	Celsius as the change in temperature for a doubling of CO2. The warming we would expect
375880	380240	to get if we doubled the CO2 concentration in the atmosphere, that is what's known as
380240	386200	climate sensitivity, will be about a fifth of a Celsius degree, just a little bit more
386200	391000	than a fifth of a Celsius degree. In his piece in the Forum on Physics and Society newsletter,
391000	396700	Moncton gives yet another figure for temperature rise, 0.58 degrees centigrade. Which one Moncton
396700	401220	decides to settle on really doesn't matter, because we'll see that his calculation method
401220	406520	is nonsense anyway. He laid it out in the APS newsletter piece. I'm not going to go
406520	411360	over the whole thing because people far better qualified than me have already done that. I'll
411360	415920	just point out one of the most egregious errors that even the most scientifically illiterate
415920	422360	can grasp. It concerns the figure for forcing, which Moncton initially puts at 3.405 watts
422360	428480	per square metre. Okay, this is lower than the accepted estimate of 3.5 to 3.7, but never
428480	435140	mind, that small beer compared to what he does next. He divides it by three. So he now
435140	441920	gives us a forcing of just 1.135 watts per square metre. Moncton says this is to take
441920	446020	account of the observed failure of the tropical mid-troposphere to warm as projected by the
446020	451640	models, citing a paper by Richard Linson. But whether the tropical mid-troposphere warms
451640	458140	as projected or not, this isn't forcing. It's sensitivity. Nowhere in the cited paper does
458140	464940	Linson cut forcing. In fact, Linson specifically says in the same paper that forcing is 3.5
464940	471640	watts per square metre for a doubling of CO2. Nowhere near Moncton's 1.135. Surely
471640	476580	no-one who testifies to Congress on the subject of climate could possibly mix up sensitivity
476580	481540	and forcing, especially in what he claims is his peer-reviewed paper. That would be
481540	486360	like confusing time and distance, or pressure and volume. They're two completely different
486360	493220	things. But then our old ally comes along to show that's exactly what he did. In an
493220	498320	attempt to hit back at his critics, Moncton justified his decision by citing a passage
498320	503980	from Linson's 2007 paper. He made a mistake on the date, by the way. But it's obvious
503980	510220	that in the passage Moncton quotes, Linson is talking about sensitivity, not forcing.
510220	515540	After reading the critiques of his calculation, Moncton obviously and rather belatedly realised
515540	520840	this. But instead of admitting his mistake, Moncton decides to simply substitute one word
520840	526620	for another, as if no-one will notice. In his rebuttal, he justifies dividing sensitivity
526620	532500	by three. But if we check back with his APS piece, we can see he didn't do any such thing.
532500	538520	He divided forcing by three, and he says so. It even came in a section titled, radiative
538520	543420	forcing reconsidered. I don't think anyone could show more clearly that Moncton mistook
543420	549740	sensitivity for forcing than this attempt at a rebuttal by Moncton himself. So as impressive
549740	553680	as Moncton's equations may seem, and as clever as they make Moncton look in front
553680	559440	of audiences, they're nonsense. The trouble is, audiences do get dazzled by sums and symbols,
559440	562200	and can't tell the difference between good physics and crap.
562200	567620	If we apply that equation to this question of whether the clouds building up would make
567620	572840	the earth warmer or cooler, we get an extremely clear answer. It would make it cooler if you
572840	576880	had more clouds. I'm not going to go through this calculation now. You'll be glad to
576880	581980	hear it. Anyone who's nerdy enough to want to follow it, get my slides and read the text
581980	582980	underneath.
582980	588440	Please sir, I'm nerdy enough. First, another quick explanation. Albedo is the reflectivity
588440	593620	of a surface. So a black surface will have a very low albedo and a warming effect because
593620	599060	it doesn't reflect much radiation. A white or shiny surface will have a very high albedo
599060	604740	and a cooling effect. So let's go to the slides. Moncton's hypothesis on this is called
604740	610280	bears crap in the woods. Here we demonstrate very easily that increasing the earth's albedo
610280	616060	has a very large cooling effect. Well, yes, that was easy. Since increasing albedo has
616060	621480	a cooling effect, Moncton has successfully demonstrated that increasing albedo has a
621480	626700	cooling effect, and sitting under a shade has a shading effect. Then Moncton imagines
626700	630960	the earth without an atmosphere, so that an increase in cloud cover is represented by
630960	636060	an increase in whiteness on the planet's surface. Again, no arguments about the result.
636060	641420	If you paint dark areas of a planet white, you increase the albedo and cool it down.
641420	647260	Moncton concludes that therefore, the higher the albedo, the cooler the planet. Well, no,
647260	651280	that's different. A cooling effect is not the same as saying that one thing will be
651280	656500	cooler than another. The best way to empirically show that this is crap is to apply it to a
656500	662920	couple of planets. Venus has a very high albedo of around 0.75, while Mercury is less
662920	669400	than 0.1. So according to Moncton, Venus should be much cooler than Mercury. In fact, it's
669400	675720	hotter, even though it's much further from the sun. Why? Because it has an atmosphere.
675720	679520	Of course, Moncton eliminated the earth's atmosphere in order to do his hypothetical
679520	685360	calculation, but as we can see from the example of Venus and Mercury, this hypothetical exercise
685380	691460	leads to a hypothetical result that doesn't match reality. So let's come back to the real
691460	696820	world and put the earth's atmosphere back. Now, instead of just reflecting solar radiation
696820	701280	and cooling the earth down, the clouds do what they do in the real world. They also
701280	706880	stop radiation escaping from earth and add warming. In his speeches, of course, Moncton
706880	712580	doesn't tell his audience that his proof requires the omission of the atmosphere. Well then,
712580	718160	is there anyone who can support Moncton on this? Now, this paper was written in 2005
718160	724280	by a satellite nerd named Pinker. He is wholly unconcerned with the global warming debate.
724280	729080	And what he found was this, that there was a significant, naturally occurring decline
729080	735720	in cloud cover between 1983 and 2001. So what we know from this is that something like four
735720	740000	fifths of the warming over that period in the satellite era, when we can work out what
740000	744980	caused it, was in fact caused by a change in cloud cover. The radiative forcing, the
744980	750860	change in temperature forced by something happening was naturally occurring. Cloud cover
750860	755140	change of three watts per square meter. Hold that thought while we watch a clip from Annie
755140	759820	Hall. I think that my insight into Mr. McLuhan will have a great deal of validity. Oh, do
759820	764180	you? Well, that's funny because I happen to have Mr. McLuhan right here. So, so, yeah,
764180	769580	just let me, let me, let me come over here a second. Oh, I heard what you were saying.
769580	774780	You know nothing of my work. You mean my whole fallacy is wrong. How you ever got to
774780	779680	teach a course in anything is totally amazing. Boy, if life were only like this. Well, sometimes
779680	786620	life is like that. When Monckton again pontificated on the work of Dr. Pinker at a debate in Australia,
786620	792280	his opponent Tim Lambert was ready for him. So here we have an enormous, naturally occurring
792280	797640	forcing verified in Pinker's paper by four separate methods. Lambert did the next best
797640	802240	thing to dragging Pinker on stage. He had a recording of someone reading a statement
802240	807500	from her. The CO2 radiative forcing value that Mr. Christopher Monckton is quoting refers
807500	812540	to the impact on the Earth's radiative balance. The numbers that we quote in our paper represent
812540	817940	the change in surface shortwave radiation due to changes in the atmosphere. Clouds,
817940	823460	water vapour, aerosols. These two numbers cannot be compared at their face value. To
823460	827720	the best of my understanding, this is the source of the misunderstanding. This might
827720	833080	seem amusing, but several months after hearing Dr. Pinker's words for himself, Monckton was
833080	838320	still misrepresenting her paper, this time to members of Congress. This is Dr. Pinker's
838320	845320	paper establishing that the warming of that period was caused largely by a naturally occurring
845320	849760	reduction in cloud cover, extra sunlight reaching the ground. For some reason they preferred
849760	855220	to hear an explanation of Dr. Pinker's work from Monckton rather than Dr. Pinker. So once
855220	860820	again Pinker had to issue a rebuttal, this time to Congress, detailing Monckton's misreading
860820	867820	and misunderstanding of her research. I'm going to testify not of course as a scientist
868060	874980	because I'm not one, but as a policy maker. And the role of policy makers when confronted
875000	882000	with scientists is to know what questions to ask and I'm going to raise one or two questions
883040	890040	now. It relies on a bogus statistical technique. It is defective as I shall now show. Not very
892140	899140	much warming is going to happen. The reality however is just 0.7. The IPCC should not have
899840	906240	used that first graph. Let us now see what the true position is. The conclusion from
906240	911240	this is that we can explain the warming by other methods.
