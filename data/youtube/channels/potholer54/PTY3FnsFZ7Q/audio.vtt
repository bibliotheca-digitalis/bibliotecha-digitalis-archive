00:00.000 --> 00:05.440
Let's take Professor Richard Linden, for instance, who has produced paper after paper

00:05.440 --> 00:09.560
showing that climate sensitivity is around a quarter to a seventh of what the Euro has

00:09.560 --> 00:13.080
changed. That means three watts per square meter, all anthropogenic forcings estimated

00:13.080 --> 00:17.460
by the IPCC, 0.8, five times as much forcing for natural causes.

00:17.460 --> 00:22.380
The question I asked in my first video on Moncton is, why do people believe him? And

00:22.380 --> 00:27.460
here we start to get an insight. Here he is on national television in Australia debating

00:27.460 --> 00:32.660
a professional climate scientist and easily getting the better of him. You can tell Dr

00:32.660 --> 00:38.500
Ben McNeill is thinking, shit, I thought this would be a pushover. I wish I'd prepared.

00:38.500 --> 00:42.500
Yes, McNeill would have been wise to find out a bit more about Moncton and his arguments

00:42.500 --> 00:46.740
before coming on the programme, because Moncton certainly did his homework on McNeill.

00:46.740 --> 00:51.440
With all respect, you are not an expert on the central question in this debate, which

00:51.440 --> 00:56.800
is climate sensitivity. How much warming will you get if you add CO2 to the atmosphere?

00:56.800 --> 01:01.640
And he's right. McNeill isn't an expert on climate sensitivity. He's an expert on carbon

01:01.640 --> 01:06.960
dioxide absorption in oceans, which is the subject of most of his research. So when Moncton

01:06.960 --> 01:12.160
turns to an area outside of McNeill's expertise, Moncton can pretty well make any claim he

01:12.160 --> 01:17.840
likes without fear of contradiction. Let's face it, he sounds bold, confident, eloquent

01:17.840 --> 01:22.640
and sure of his assertions. McNeill can't check whether Moncton's claims are correct.

01:22.640 --> 01:27.840
Neither can the interviewer. But we can. So that's exactly what we're going to do.

01:27.840 --> 01:33.360
First, let me explain some terms that you'll hear a lot. Put simply, forcing is the amount

01:33.360 --> 01:38.440
of warming caused by whatever might be warming the Earth. It could be the sun, or a greenhouse

01:38.440 --> 01:43.840
gas or a light reflective surface turning into a darker one. The amount of forcing or

01:43.840 --> 01:49.640
warming due to a doubling of CO2 levels is pretty much agreed on by all climatologists.

01:49.640 --> 01:54.680
Richard Linson, the skeptic everyone likes to quote, says this figure is about 3.5 watts

01:54.680 --> 02:00.680
per square metre, as noted in the last three IPCC scientific assessments. The IPCC actually

02:00.680 --> 02:05.080
puts the figure at 3.7 watts per square metre, but there's a margin of error, so we're in

02:05.080 --> 02:10.360
the same ballpark. When forcing increases, the average global surface temperature rises

02:10.360 --> 02:14.560
until it reaches a stage where the amount of energy leaving the Earth is about the same

02:14.560 --> 02:19.320
as the amount of energy being pumped in by the forcing. This is called the equilibrium

02:19.320 --> 02:24.400
temperature and in its most basic form it's very easy to work out. Temperature equals

02:24.400 --> 02:29.520
forcing times lambda, which is the Earth's sensitivity. It's usually written as delta

02:29.520 --> 02:35.920
T to denote a change in temperature in response to delta F, a change in forcing. So forcing

02:35.920 --> 02:40.880
is like a heater in a cabin, and sensitivity tells us the final temperature the cabin will

02:40.880 --> 02:45.880
reach in response to that heat. It's important to understand the difference between forcing

02:45.880 --> 02:50.920
and sensitivity, because as we'll see in a minute, Moncton gets them completely mixed

02:50.920 --> 02:57.640
up. If no other factors are involved, climate sensitivity is about 0.27, so if we plug in

02:57.640 --> 03:03.120
a forcing of 3.7 watts per square metre caused by a doubling of CO2, we'd get an increase

03:03.120 --> 03:08.500
in temperature of about 1 degree centigrade. This is also generally agreed on by all climate

03:08.500 --> 03:14.420
scientists. Unfortunately, other factors are involved. As the Earth warms towards this

03:14.420 --> 03:19.340
level, changes happen that tend to amplify and reduce the warming, known as positive

03:19.340 --> 03:24.940
and negative feedback. Lindsen argues that more water vapour will produce more clouds,

03:24.940 --> 03:30.300
which reflect sunlight and may act as a negative feedback, outweighing all the positives. The

03:30.300 --> 03:35.180
reason this isn't generally accepted is because other climatologists have found flaws in Lindsen's

03:35.180 --> 03:40.720
hypothesis. For one thing, it only encompasses the tropics, not the whole Earth. And even

03:40.720 --> 03:45.660
clouds in the tropics not only reflect sunlight and act as a negative feedback, they also

03:45.660 --> 03:51.700
send outgoing longwave radiation back to Earth, and so act as a positive feedback. And the

03:51.700 --> 03:56.100
other reason Lindsen's hypothesis doesn't fit is that researchers working in a completely

03:56.100 --> 04:01.460
different field, geology, found that the feedback effects from CO2 in the past were clearly

04:01.460 --> 04:07.000
positive, not negative. So these various feedbacks have to be plugged in to find out

04:07.000 --> 04:11.700
what the Earth's sensitivity really is, and therefore what the equilibrium temperature

04:11.700 --> 04:17.860
will be. Modelling is just one of many different ways sensitivity can be determined. Glaciologists

04:17.860 --> 04:22.940
and geologists determine sensitivity by looking at how global temperatures changed according

04:22.940 --> 04:28.260
to carbon dioxide level rises in the past. A review of the various results from a dozen

04:28.260 --> 04:33.300
different methods, each denoted by a different colour, shows that nearly all cluster around

04:33.300 --> 04:39.900
the 2 to 4.5 degree range. I'll squash them up so we can see them in one frame. The thicker

04:39.900 --> 04:45.140
lines show more results and greater probability. Individual results that are well outside the

04:45.140 --> 04:51.540
cluster, known as outliers, are marked with crosses. So let's just pick a result at random.

04:51.540 --> 04:56.060
This study, for instance, shows that global temperatures will rise by 10 degrees because

04:56.060 --> 05:03.220
of a doubling of CO2. And this one, for instance, says the same thing. So we now know that temperatures

05:03.220 --> 05:09.540
will rise by 10 degrees, which is three times higher than the IPCC estimate. What do you

05:09.540 --> 05:15.780
mean that's nonsense? Rats. The Moncton fans have spotted what I did. Yes, I completely

05:15.780 --> 05:20.180
ignored the majority of results clustered in the middle and just happened to deliberately

05:20.180 --> 05:25.000
pick the most extreme outliers. Then I pretended that they were representative of the body

05:25.000 --> 05:29.700
of evidence and claimed that we know these results are correct. You could just as easily

05:29.700 --> 05:34.240
pick a couple of studies from the opposite extreme and do the same thing. But who would

05:34.240 --> 05:39.780
do something as obviously bogus as that? Let's take Professor Richard Linden, for instance,

05:39.780 --> 05:43.900
who has produced paper after paper showing that climate sensitivity is around a quarter

05:43.900 --> 05:48.460
to a second. So now we're beginning to see Moncton's performance in context. He cherry-picked

05:48.460 --> 05:53.520
extremely low figures that are clearly outside the range of most research. Then he conveys

05:53.520 --> 05:58.800
the impression that this result is correct, undisputed, known and settled. The biggest

05:58.800 --> 06:03.040
problem is that a number of papers have found flaws in the research of Lindsen, Douglas

06:03.040 --> 06:09.400
and Knox and Moncton makes no mention of this. Here's my own calculation and we get 1.6 degrees

06:09.400 --> 06:15.880
Celsius as the change in temperature for a doubling of CO2. The warming we would expect

06:15.880 --> 06:20.240
to get if we doubled the CO2 concentration in the atmosphere, that is what's known as

06:20.240 --> 06:26.200
climate sensitivity, will be about a fifth of a Celsius degree, just a little bit more

06:26.200 --> 06:31.000
than a fifth of a Celsius degree. In his piece in the Forum on Physics and Society newsletter,

06:31.000 --> 06:36.700
Moncton gives yet another figure for temperature rise, 0.58 degrees centigrade. Which one Moncton

06:36.700 --> 06:41.220
decides to settle on really doesn't matter, because we'll see that his calculation method

06:41.220 --> 06:46.520
is nonsense anyway. He laid it out in the APS newsletter piece. I'm not going to go

06:46.520 --> 06:51.360
over the whole thing because people far better qualified than me have already done that. I'll

06:51.360 --> 06:55.920
just point out one of the most egregious errors that even the most scientifically illiterate

06:55.920 --> 07:02.360
can grasp. It concerns the figure for forcing, which Moncton initially puts at 3.405 watts

07:02.360 --> 07:08.480
per square metre. Okay, this is lower than the accepted estimate of 3.5 to 3.7, but never

07:08.480 --> 07:15.140
mind, that small beer compared to what he does next. He divides it by three. So he now

07:15.140 --> 07:21.920
gives us a forcing of just 1.135 watts per square metre. Moncton says this is to take

07:21.920 --> 07:26.020
account of the observed failure of the tropical mid-troposphere to warm as projected by the

07:26.020 --> 07:31.640
models, citing a paper by Richard Linson. But whether the tropical mid-troposphere warms

07:31.640 --> 07:38.140
as projected or not, this isn't forcing. It's sensitivity. Nowhere in the cited paper does

07:38.140 --> 07:44.940
Linson cut forcing. In fact, Linson specifically says in the same paper that forcing is 3.5

07:44.940 --> 07:51.640
watts per square metre for a doubling of CO2. Nowhere near Moncton's 1.135. Surely

07:51.640 --> 07:56.580
no-one who testifies to Congress on the subject of climate could possibly mix up sensitivity

07:56.580 --> 08:01.540
and forcing, especially in what he claims is his peer-reviewed paper. That would be

08:01.540 --> 08:06.360
like confusing time and distance, or pressure and volume. They're two completely different

08:06.360 --> 08:13.220
things. But then our old ally comes along to show that's exactly what he did. In an

08:13.220 --> 08:18.320
attempt to hit back at his critics, Moncton justified his decision by citing a passage

08:18.320 --> 08:23.980
from Linson's 2007 paper. He made a mistake on the date, by the way. But it's obvious

08:23.980 --> 08:30.220
that in the passage Moncton quotes, Linson is talking about sensitivity, not forcing.

08:30.220 --> 08:35.540
After reading the critiques of his calculation, Moncton obviously and rather belatedly realised

08:35.540 --> 08:40.840
this. But instead of admitting his mistake, Moncton decides to simply substitute one word

08:40.840 --> 08:46.620
for another, as if no-one will notice. In his rebuttal, he justifies dividing sensitivity

08:46.620 --> 08:52.500
by three. But if we check back with his APS piece, we can see he didn't do any such thing.

08:52.500 --> 08:58.520
He divided forcing by three, and he says so. It even came in a section titled, radiative

08:58.520 --> 09:03.420
forcing reconsidered. I don't think anyone could show more clearly that Moncton mistook

09:03.420 --> 09:09.740
sensitivity for forcing than this attempt at a rebuttal by Moncton himself. So as impressive

09:09.740 --> 09:13.680
as Moncton's equations may seem, and as clever as they make Moncton look in front

09:13.680 --> 09:19.440
of audiences, they're nonsense. The trouble is, audiences do get dazzled by sums and symbols,

09:19.440 --> 09:22.200
and can't tell the difference between good physics and crap.

09:22.200 --> 09:27.620
If we apply that equation to this question of whether the clouds building up would make

09:27.620 --> 09:32.840
the earth warmer or cooler, we get an extremely clear answer. It would make it cooler if you

09:32.840 --> 09:36.880
had more clouds. I'm not going to go through this calculation now. You'll be glad to

09:36.880 --> 09:41.980
hear it. Anyone who's nerdy enough to want to follow it, get my slides and read the text

09:41.980 --> 09:42.980
underneath.

09:42.980 --> 09:48.440
Please sir, I'm nerdy enough. First, another quick explanation. Albedo is the reflectivity

09:48.440 --> 09:53.620
of a surface. So a black surface will have a very low albedo and a warming effect because

09:53.620 --> 09:59.060
it doesn't reflect much radiation. A white or shiny surface will have a very high albedo

09:59.060 --> 10:04.740
and a cooling effect. So let's go to the slides. Moncton's hypothesis on this is called

10:04.740 --> 10:10.280
bears crap in the woods. Here we demonstrate very easily that increasing the earth's albedo

10:10.280 --> 10:16.060
has a very large cooling effect. Well, yes, that was easy. Since increasing albedo has

10:16.060 --> 10:21.480
a cooling effect, Moncton has successfully demonstrated that increasing albedo has a

10:21.480 --> 10:26.700
cooling effect, and sitting under a shade has a shading effect. Then Moncton imagines

10:26.700 --> 10:30.960
the earth without an atmosphere, so that an increase in cloud cover is represented by

10:30.960 --> 10:36.060
an increase in whiteness on the planet's surface. Again, no arguments about the result.

10:36.060 --> 10:41.420
If you paint dark areas of a planet white, you increase the albedo and cool it down.

10:41.420 --> 10:47.260
Moncton concludes that therefore, the higher the albedo, the cooler the planet. Well, no,

10:47.260 --> 10:51.280
that's different. A cooling effect is not the same as saying that one thing will be

10:51.280 --> 10:56.500
cooler than another. The best way to empirically show that this is crap is to apply it to a

10:56.500 --> 11:02.920
couple of planets. Venus has a very high albedo of around 0.75, while Mercury is less

11:02.920 --> 11:09.400
than 0.1. So according to Moncton, Venus should be much cooler than Mercury. In fact, it's

11:09.400 --> 11:15.720
hotter, even though it's much further from the sun. Why? Because it has an atmosphere.

11:15.720 --> 11:19.520
Of course, Moncton eliminated the earth's atmosphere in order to do his hypothetical

11:19.520 --> 11:25.360
calculation, but as we can see from the example of Venus and Mercury, this hypothetical exercise

11:25.380 --> 11:31.460
leads to a hypothetical result that doesn't match reality. So let's come back to the real

11:31.460 --> 11:36.820
world and put the earth's atmosphere back. Now, instead of just reflecting solar radiation

11:36.820 --> 11:41.280
and cooling the earth down, the clouds do what they do in the real world. They also

11:41.280 --> 11:46.880
stop radiation escaping from earth and add warming. In his speeches, of course, Moncton

11:46.880 --> 11:52.580
doesn't tell his audience that his proof requires the omission of the atmosphere. Well then,

11:52.580 --> 11:58.160
is there anyone who can support Moncton on this? Now, this paper was written in 2005

11:58.160 --> 12:04.280
by a satellite nerd named Pinker. He is wholly unconcerned with the global warming debate.

12:04.280 --> 12:09.080
And what he found was this, that there was a significant, naturally occurring decline

12:09.080 --> 12:15.720
in cloud cover between 1983 and 2001. So what we know from this is that something like four

12:15.720 --> 12:20.000
fifths of the warming over that period in the satellite era, when we can work out what

12:20.000 --> 12:24.980
caused it, was in fact caused by a change in cloud cover. The radiative forcing, the

12:24.980 --> 12:30.860
change in temperature forced by something happening was naturally occurring. Cloud cover

12:30.860 --> 12:35.140
change of three watts per square meter. Hold that thought while we watch a clip from Annie

12:35.140 --> 12:39.820
Hall. I think that my insight into Mr. McLuhan will have a great deal of validity. Oh, do

12:39.820 --> 12:44.180
you? Well, that's funny because I happen to have Mr. McLuhan right here. So, so, yeah,

12:44.180 --> 12:49.580
just let me, let me, let me come over here a second. Oh, I heard what you were saying.

12:49.580 --> 12:54.780
You know nothing of my work. You mean my whole fallacy is wrong. How you ever got to

12:54.780 --> 12:59.680
teach a course in anything is totally amazing. Boy, if life were only like this. Well, sometimes

12:59.680 --> 13:06.620
life is like that. When Monckton again pontificated on the work of Dr. Pinker at a debate in Australia,

13:06.620 --> 13:12.280
his opponent Tim Lambert was ready for him. So here we have an enormous, naturally occurring

13:12.280 --> 13:17.640
forcing verified in Pinker's paper by four separate methods. Lambert did the next best

13:17.640 --> 13:22.240
thing to dragging Pinker on stage. He had a recording of someone reading a statement

13:22.240 --> 13:27.500
from her. The CO2 radiative forcing value that Mr. Christopher Monckton is quoting refers

13:27.500 --> 13:32.540
to the impact on the Earth's radiative balance. The numbers that we quote in our paper represent

13:32.540 --> 13:37.940
the change in surface shortwave radiation due to changes in the atmosphere. Clouds,

13:37.940 --> 13:43.460
water vapour, aerosols. These two numbers cannot be compared at their face value. To

13:43.460 --> 13:47.720
the best of my understanding, this is the source of the misunderstanding. This might

13:47.720 --> 13:53.080
seem amusing, but several months after hearing Dr. Pinker's words for himself, Monckton was

13:53.080 --> 13:58.320
still misrepresenting her paper, this time to members of Congress. This is Dr. Pinker's

13:58.320 --> 14:05.320
paper establishing that the warming of that period was caused largely by a naturally occurring

14:05.320 --> 14:09.760
reduction in cloud cover, extra sunlight reaching the ground. For some reason they preferred

14:09.760 --> 14:15.220
to hear an explanation of Dr. Pinker's work from Monckton rather than Dr. Pinker. So once

14:15.220 --> 14:20.820
again Pinker had to issue a rebuttal, this time to Congress, detailing Monckton's misreading

14:20.820 --> 14:27.820
and misunderstanding of her research. I'm going to testify not of course as a scientist

14:28.060 --> 14:34.980
because I'm not one, but as a policy maker. And the role of policy makers when confronted

14:35.000 --> 14:42.000
with scientists is to know what questions to ask and I'm going to raise one or two questions

14:43.040 --> 14:50.040
now. It relies on a bogus statistical technique. It is defective as I shall now show. Not very

14:52.140 --> 14:59.140
much warming is going to happen. The reality however is just 0.7. The IPCC should not have

14:59.840 --> 15:06.240
used that first graph. Let us now see what the true position is. The conclusion from

15:06.240 --> 15:11.240
this is that we can explain the warming by other methods.
