1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,440
Let's take Professor Richard Linden, for instance, who has produced paper after paper

2
00:00:05,440 --> 00:00:09,560
showing that climate sensitivity is around a quarter to a seventh of what the Euro has

3
00:00:09,560 --> 00:00:13,080
changed. That means three watts per square meter, all anthropogenic forcings estimated

4
00:00:13,080 --> 00:00:17,460
by the IPCC, 0.8, five times as much forcing for natural causes.

5
00:00:17,460 --> 00:00:22,380
The question I asked in my first video on Moncton is, why do people believe him? And

6
00:00:22,380 --> 00:00:27,460
here we start to get an insight. Here he is on national television in Australia debating

7
00:00:27,460 --> 00:00:32,660
a professional climate scientist and easily getting the better of him. You can tell Dr

8
00:00:32,660 --> 00:00:38,500
Ben McNeill is thinking, shit, I thought this would be a pushover. I wish I'd prepared.

9
00:00:38,500 --> 00:00:42,500
Yes, McNeill would have been wise to find out a bit more about Moncton and his arguments

10
00:00:42,500 --> 00:00:46,740
before coming on the programme, because Moncton certainly did his homework on McNeill.

11
00:00:46,740 --> 00:00:51,440
With all respect, you are not an expert on the central question in this debate, which

12
00:00:51,440 --> 00:00:56,800
is climate sensitivity. How much warming will you get if you add CO2 to the atmosphere?

13
00:00:56,800 --> 00:01:01,640
And he's right. McNeill isn't an expert on climate sensitivity. He's an expert on carbon

14
00:01:01,640 --> 00:01:06,960
dioxide absorption in oceans, which is the subject of most of his research. So when Moncton

15
00:01:06,960 --> 00:01:12,160
turns to an area outside of McNeill's expertise, Moncton can pretty well make any claim he

16
00:01:12,160 --> 00:01:17,840
likes without fear of contradiction. Let's face it, he sounds bold, confident, eloquent

17
00:01:17,840 --> 00:01:22,640
and sure of his assertions. McNeill can't check whether Moncton's claims are correct.

18
00:01:22,640 --> 00:01:27,840
Neither can the interviewer. But we can. So that's exactly what we're going to do.

19
00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:33,360
First, let me explain some terms that you'll hear a lot. Put simply, forcing is the amount

20
00:01:33,360 --> 00:01:38,440
of warming caused by whatever might be warming the Earth. It could be the sun, or a greenhouse

21
00:01:38,440 --> 00:01:43,840
gas or a light reflective surface turning into a darker one. The amount of forcing or

22
00:01:43,840 --> 00:01:49,640
warming due to a doubling of CO2 levels is pretty much agreed on by all climatologists.

23
00:01:49,640 --> 00:01:54,680
Richard Linson, the skeptic everyone likes to quote, says this figure is about 3.5 watts

24
00:01:54,680 --> 00:02:00,680
per square metre, as noted in the last three IPCC scientific assessments. The IPCC actually

25
00:02:00,680 --> 00:02:05,080
puts the figure at 3.7 watts per square metre, but there's a margin of error, so we're in

26
00:02:05,080 --> 00:02:10,360
the same ballpark. When forcing increases, the average global surface temperature rises

27
00:02:10,360 --> 00:02:14,560
until it reaches a stage where the amount of energy leaving the Earth is about the same

28
00:02:14,560 --> 00:02:19,320
as the amount of energy being pumped in by the forcing. This is called the equilibrium

29
00:02:19,320 --> 00:02:24,400
temperature and in its most basic form it's very easy to work out. Temperature equals

30
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:29,520
forcing times lambda, which is the Earth's sensitivity. It's usually written as delta

31
00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:35,920
T to denote a change in temperature in response to delta F, a change in forcing. So forcing

32
00:02:35,920 --> 00:02:40,880
is like a heater in a cabin, and sensitivity tells us the final temperature the cabin will

33
00:02:40,880 --> 00:02:45,880
reach in response to that heat. It's important to understand the difference between forcing

34
00:02:45,880 --> 00:02:50,920
and sensitivity, because as we'll see in a minute, Moncton gets them completely mixed

35
00:02:50,920 --> 00:02:57,640
up. If no other factors are involved, climate sensitivity is about 0.27, so if we plug in

36
00:02:57,640 --> 00:03:03,120
a forcing of 3.7 watts per square metre caused by a doubling of CO2, we'd get an increase

37
00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:08,500
in temperature of about 1 degree centigrade. This is also generally agreed on by all climate

38
00:03:08,500 --> 00:03:14,420
scientists. Unfortunately, other factors are involved. As the Earth warms towards this

39
00:03:14,420 --> 00:03:19,340
level, changes happen that tend to amplify and reduce the warming, known as positive

40
00:03:19,340 --> 00:03:24,940
and negative feedback. Lindsen argues that more water vapour will produce more clouds,

41
00:03:24,940 --> 00:03:30,300
which reflect sunlight and may act as a negative feedback, outweighing all the positives. The

42
00:03:30,300 --> 00:03:35,180
reason this isn't generally accepted is because other climatologists have found flaws in Lindsen's

43
00:03:35,180 --> 00:03:40,720
hypothesis. For one thing, it only encompasses the tropics, not the whole Earth. And even

44
00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:45,660
clouds in the tropics not only reflect sunlight and act as a negative feedback, they also

45
00:03:45,660 --> 00:03:51,700
send outgoing longwave radiation back to Earth, and so act as a positive feedback. And the

46
00:03:51,700 --> 00:03:56,100
other reason Lindsen's hypothesis doesn't fit is that researchers working in a completely

47
00:03:56,100 --> 00:04:01,460
different field, geology, found that the feedback effects from CO2 in the past were clearly

48
00:04:01,460 --> 00:04:07,000
positive, not negative. So these various feedbacks have to be plugged in to find out

49
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:11,700
what the Earth's sensitivity really is, and therefore what the equilibrium temperature

50
00:04:11,700 --> 00:04:17,860
will be. Modelling is just one of many different ways sensitivity can be determined. Glaciologists

51
00:04:17,860 --> 00:04:22,940
and geologists determine sensitivity by looking at how global temperatures changed according

52
00:04:22,940 --> 00:04:28,260
to carbon dioxide level rises in the past. A review of the various results from a dozen

53
00:04:28,260 --> 00:04:33,300
different methods, each denoted by a different colour, shows that nearly all cluster around

54
00:04:33,300 --> 00:04:39,900
the 2 to 4.5 degree range. I'll squash them up so we can see them in one frame. The thicker

55
00:04:39,900 --> 00:04:45,140
lines show more results and greater probability. Individual results that are well outside the

56
00:04:45,140 --> 00:04:51,540
cluster, known as outliers, are marked with crosses. So let's just pick a result at random.

57
00:04:51,540 --> 00:04:56,060
This study, for instance, shows that global temperatures will rise by 10 degrees because

58
00:04:56,060 --> 00:05:03,220
of a doubling of CO2. And this one, for instance, says the same thing. So we now know that temperatures

59
00:05:03,220 --> 00:05:09,540
will rise by 10 degrees, which is three times higher than the IPCC estimate. What do you

60
00:05:09,540 --> 00:05:15,780
mean that's nonsense? Rats. The Moncton fans have spotted what I did. Yes, I completely

61
00:05:15,780 --> 00:05:20,180
ignored the majority of results clustered in the middle and just happened to deliberately

62
00:05:20,180 --> 00:05:25,000
pick the most extreme outliers. Then I pretended that they were representative of the body

63
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:29,700
of evidence and claimed that we know these results are correct. You could just as easily

64
00:05:29,700 --> 00:05:34,240
pick a couple of studies from the opposite extreme and do the same thing. But who would

65
00:05:34,240 --> 00:05:39,780
do something as obviously bogus as that? Let's take Professor Richard Linden, for instance,

66
00:05:39,780 --> 00:05:43,900
who has produced paper after paper showing that climate sensitivity is around a quarter

67
00:05:43,900 --> 00:05:48,460
to a second. So now we're beginning to see Moncton's performance in context. He cherry-picked

68
00:05:48,460 --> 00:05:53,520
extremely low figures that are clearly outside the range of most research. Then he conveys

69
00:05:53,520 --> 00:05:58,800
the impression that this result is correct, undisputed, known and settled. The biggest

70
00:05:58,800 --> 00:06:03,040
problem is that a number of papers have found flaws in the research of Lindsen, Douglas

71
00:06:03,040 --> 00:06:09,400
and Knox and Moncton makes no mention of this. Here's my own calculation and we get 1.6 degrees

72
00:06:09,400 --> 00:06:15,880
Celsius as the change in temperature for a doubling of CO2. The warming we would expect

73
00:06:15,880 --> 00:06:20,240
to get if we doubled the CO2 concentration in the atmosphere, that is what's known as

74
00:06:20,240 --> 00:06:26,200
climate sensitivity, will be about a fifth of a Celsius degree, just a little bit more

75
00:06:26,200 --> 00:06:31,000
than a fifth of a Celsius degree. In his piece in the Forum on Physics and Society newsletter,

76
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:36,700
Moncton gives yet another figure for temperature rise, 0.58 degrees centigrade. Which one Moncton

77
00:06:36,700 --> 00:06:41,220
decides to settle on really doesn't matter, because we'll see that his calculation method

78
00:06:41,220 --> 00:06:46,520
is nonsense anyway. He laid it out in the APS newsletter piece. I'm not going to go

79
00:06:46,520 --> 00:06:51,360
over the whole thing because people far better qualified than me have already done that. I'll

80
00:06:51,360 --> 00:06:55,920
just point out one of the most egregious errors that even the most scientifically illiterate

81
00:06:55,920 --> 00:07:02,360
can grasp. It concerns the figure for forcing, which Moncton initially puts at 3.405 watts

82
00:07:02,360 --> 00:07:08,480
per square metre. Okay, this is lower than the accepted estimate of 3.5 to 3.7, but never

83
00:07:08,480 --> 00:07:15,140
mind, that small beer compared to what he does next. He divides it by three. So he now

84
00:07:15,140 --> 00:07:21,920
gives us a forcing of just 1.135 watts per square metre. Moncton says this is to take

85
00:07:21,920 --> 00:07:26,020
account of the observed failure of the tropical mid-troposphere to warm as projected by the

86
00:07:26,020 --> 00:07:31,640
models, citing a paper by Richard Linson. But whether the tropical mid-troposphere warms

87
00:07:31,640 --> 00:07:38,140
as projected or not, this isn't forcing. It's sensitivity. Nowhere in the cited paper does

88
00:07:38,140 --> 00:07:44,940
Linson cut forcing. In fact, Linson specifically says in the same paper that forcing is 3.5

89
00:07:44,940 --> 00:07:51,640
watts per square metre for a doubling of CO2. Nowhere near Moncton's 1.135. Surely

90
00:07:51,640 --> 00:07:56,580
no-one who testifies to Congress on the subject of climate could possibly mix up sensitivity

91
00:07:56,580 --> 00:08:01,540
and forcing, especially in what he claims is his peer-reviewed paper. That would be

92
00:08:01,540 --> 00:08:06,360
like confusing time and distance, or pressure and volume. They're two completely different

93
00:08:06,360 --> 00:08:13,220
things. But then our old ally comes along to show that's exactly what he did. In an

94
00:08:13,220 --> 00:08:18,320
attempt to hit back at his critics, Moncton justified his decision by citing a passage

95
00:08:18,320 --> 00:08:23,980
from Linson's 2007 paper. He made a mistake on the date, by the way. But it's obvious

96
00:08:23,980 --> 00:08:30,220
that in the passage Moncton quotes, Linson is talking about sensitivity, not forcing.

97
00:08:30,220 --> 00:08:35,540
After reading the critiques of his calculation, Moncton obviously and rather belatedly realised

98
00:08:35,540 --> 00:08:40,840
this. But instead of admitting his mistake, Moncton decides to simply substitute one word

99
00:08:40,840 --> 00:08:46,620
for another, as if no-one will notice. In his rebuttal, he justifies dividing sensitivity

100
00:08:46,620 --> 00:08:52,500
by three. But if we check back with his APS piece, we can see he didn't do any such thing.

101
00:08:52,500 --> 00:08:58,520
He divided forcing by three, and he says so. It even came in a section titled, radiative

102
00:08:58,520 --> 00:09:03,420
forcing reconsidered. I don't think anyone could show more clearly that Moncton mistook

103
00:09:03,420 --> 00:09:09,740
sensitivity for forcing than this attempt at a rebuttal by Moncton himself. So as impressive

104
00:09:09,740 --> 00:09:13,680
as Moncton's equations may seem, and as clever as they make Moncton look in front

105
00:09:13,680 --> 00:09:19,440
of audiences, they're nonsense. The trouble is, audiences do get dazzled by sums and symbols,

106
00:09:19,440 --> 00:09:22,200
and can't tell the difference between good physics and crap.

107
00:09:22,200 --> 00:09:27,620
If we apply that equation to this question of whether the clouds building up would make

108
00:09:27,620 --> 00:09:32,840
the earth warmer or cooler, we get an extremely clear answer. It would make it cooler if you

109
00:09:32,840 --> 00:09:36,880
had more clouds. I'm not going to go through this calculation now. You'll be glad to

110
00:09:36,880 --> 00:09:41,980
hear it. Anyone who's nerdy enough to want to follow it, get my slides and read the text

111
00:09:41,980 --> 00:09:42,980
underneath.

112
00:09:42,980 --> 00:09:48,440
Please sir, I'm nerdy enough. First, another quick explanation. Albedo is the reflectivity

113
00:09:48,440 --> 00:09:53,620
of a surface. So a black surface will have a very low albedo and a warming effect because

114
00:09:53,620 --> 00:09:59,060
it doesn't reflect much radiation. A white or shiny surface will have a very high albedo

115
00:09:59,060 --> 00:10:04,740
and a cooling effect. So let's go to the slides. Moncton's hypothesis on this is called

116
00:10:04,740 --> 00:10:10,280
bears crap in the woods. Here we demonstrate very easily that increasing the earth's albedo

117
00:10:10,280 --> 00:10:16,060
has a very large cooling effect. Well, yes, that was easy. Since increasing albedo has

118
00:10:16,060 --> 00:10:21,480
a cooling effect, Moncton has successfully demonstrated that increasing albedo has a

119
00:10:21,480 --> 00:10:26,700
cooling effect, and sitting under a shade has a shading effect. Then Moncton imagines

120
00:10:26,700 --> 00:10:30,960
the earth without an atmosphere, so that an increase in cloud cover is represented by

121
00:10:30,960 --> 00:10:36,060
an increase in whiteness on the planet's surface. Again, no arguments about the result.

122
00:10:36,060 --> 00:10:41,420
If you paint dark areas of a planet white, you increase the albedo and cool it down.

123
00:10:41,420 --> 00:10:47,260
Moncton concludes that therefore, the higher the albedo, the cooler the planet. Well, no,

124
00:10:47,260 --> 00:10:51,280
that's different. A cooling effect is not the same as saying that one thing will be

125
00:10:51,280 --> 00:10:56,500
cooler than another. The best way to empirically show that this is crap is to apply it to a

126
00:10:56,500 --> 00:11:02,920
couple of planets. Venus has a very high albedo of around 0.75, while Mercury is less

127
00:11:02,920 --> 00:11:09,400
than 0.1. So according to Moncton, Venus should be much cooler than Mercury. In fact, it's

128
00:11:09,400 --> 00:11:15,720
hotter, even though it's much further from the sun. Why? Because it has an atmosphere.

129
00:11:15,720 --> 00:11:19,520
Of course, Moncton eliminated the earth's atmosphere in order to do his hypothetical

130
00:11:19,520 --> 00:11:25,360
calculation, but as we can see from the example of Venus and Mercury, this hypothetical exercise

131
00:11:25,380 --> 00:11:31,460
leads to a hypothetical result that doesn't match reality. So let's come back to the real

132
00:11:31,460 --> 00:11:36,820
world and put the earth's atmosphere back. Now, instead of just reflecting solar radiation

133
00:11:36,820 --> 00:11:41,280
and cooling the earth down, the clouds do what they do in the real world. They also

134
00:11:41,280 --> 00:11:46,880
stop radiation escaping from earth and add warming. In his speeches, of course, Moncton

135
00:11:46,880 --> 00:11:52,580
doesn't tell his audience that his proof requires the omission of the atmosphere. Well then,

136
00:11:52,580 --> 00:11:58,160
is there anyone who can support Moncton on this? Now, this paper was written in 2005

137
00:11:58,160 --> 00:12:04,280
by a satellite nerd named Pinker. He is wholly unconcerned with the global warming debate.

138
00:12:04,280 --> 00:12:09,080
And what he found was this, that there was a significant, naturally occurring decline

139
00:12:09,080 --> 00:12:15,720
in cloud cover between 1983 and 2001. So what we know from this is that something like four

140
00:12:15,720 --> 00:12:20,000
fifths of the warming over that period in the satellite era, when we can work out what

141
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:24,980
caused it, was in fact caused by a change in cloud cover. The radiative forcing, the

142
00:12:24,980 --> 00:12:30,860
change in temperature forced by something happening was naturally occurring. Cloud cover

143
00:12:30,860 --> 00:12:35,140
change of three watts per square meter. Hold that thought while we watch a clip from Annie

144
00:12:35,140 --> 00:12:39,820
Hall. I think that my insight into Mr. McLuhan will have a great deal of validity. Oh, do

145
00:12:39,820 --> 00:12:44,180
you? Well, that's funny because I happen to have Mr. McLuhan right here. So, so, yeah,

146
00:12:44,180 --> 00:12:49,580
just let me, let me, let me come over here a second. Oh, I heard what you were saying.

147
00:12:49,580 --> 00:12:54,780
You know nothing of my work. You mean my whole fallacy is wrong. How you ever got to

148
00:12:54,780 --> 00:12:59,680
teach a course in anything is totally amazing. Boy, if life were only like this. Well, sometimes

149
00:12:59,680 --> 00:13:06,620
life is like that. When Monckton again pontificated on the work of Dr. Pinker at a debate in Australia,

150
00:13:06,620 --> 00:13:12,280
his opponent Tim Lambert was ready for him. So here we have an enormous, naturally occurring

151
00:13:12,280 --> 00:13:17,640
forcing verified in Pinker's paper by four separate methods. Lambert did the next best

152
00:13:17,640 --> 00:13:22,240
thing to dragging Pinker on stage. He had a recording of someone reading a statement

153
00:13:22,240 --> 00:13:27,500
from her. The CO2 radiative forcing value that Mr. Christopher Monckton is quoting refers

154
00:13:27,500 --> 00:13:32,540
to the impact on the Earth's radiative balance. The numbers that we quote in our paper represent

155
00:13:32,540 --> 00:13:37,940
the change in surface shortwave radiation due to changes in the atmosphere. Clouds,

156
00:13:37,940 --> 00:13:43,460
water vapour, aerosols. These two numbers cannot be compared at their face value. To

157
00:13:43,460 --> 00:13:47,720
the best of my understanding, this is the source of the misunderstanding. This might

158
00:13:47,720 --> 00:13:53,080
seem amusing, but several months after hearing Dr. Pinker's words for himself, Monckton was

159
00:13:53,080 --> 00:13:58,320
still misrepresenting her paper, this time to members of Congress. This is Dr. Pinker's

160
00:13:58,320 --> 00:14:05,320
paper establishing that the warming of that period was caused largely by a naturally occurring

161
00:14:05,320 --> 00:14:09,760
reduction in cloud cover, extra sunlight reaching the ground. For some reason they preferred

162
00:14:09,760 --> 00:14:15,220
to hear an explanation of Dr. Pinker's work from Monckton rather than Dr. Pinker. So once

163
00:14:15,220 --> 00:14:20,820
again Pinker had to issue a rebuttal, this time to Congress, detailing Monckton's misreading

164
00:14:20,820 --> 00:14:27,820
and misunderstanding of her research. I'm going to testify not of course as a scientist

165
00:14:28,060 --> 00:14:34,980
because I'm not one, but as a policy maker. And the role of policy makers when confronted

166
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:42,000
with scientists is to know what questions to ask and I'm going to raise one or two questions

167
00:14:43,040 --> 00:14:50,040
now. It relies on a bogus statistical technique. It is defective as I shall now show. Not very

168
00:14:52,140 --> 00:14:59,140
much warming is going to happen. The reality however is just 0.7. The IPCC should not have

169
00:14:59,840 --> 00:15:06,240
used that first graph. Let us now see what the true position is. The conclusion from

170
00:15:06,240 --> 00:15:11,240
this is that we can explain the warming by other methods.
