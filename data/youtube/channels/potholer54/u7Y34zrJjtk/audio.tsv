0	8720	In previous videos I've shown evidence of how the world around us was formed, but a
8720	11040	fundamental question remains.
11040	26200	How did we get here?
26200	29440	The void has always been filled by fanciful stories.
29440	34200	The Chinese believed a dragon goddess needed someone to talk to, so she formed humans out
34200	36320	of clay from a river bank.
36320	40920	According to Jewish mythology, a god made a man out of clay and then fashioned a woman
40920	42720	out of one of his ribs.
42720	47240	Inuit mythology describes a raven god who filled the earth with pea pods, and one of
47240	50760	these burst open to reveal the first man.
50760	56040	But 150 years ago one book shattered these myths and opened the door to a rational and
56040	59480	evidence-based understanding of our origins.
59480	64640	But while Charles Darwin and Alfred Wallace jointly came up with the idea of natural selection,
64640	69720	they parted company on whether this evolutionary mechanism could be applied to humans.
69720	74680	Wallace formulated the idea that animals had evolved, but he couldn't compromise his belief
74680	77280	that humans were the work of a deity.
77280	82960	But Darwin caved to the inevitable conclusion and called it My Little Heresy.
82960	88000	My Little Heresy was first expounded not by Darwin but by naturalist Thomas Huxley
88000	93040	in an 1863 book called Evidence as to Man's Place in Nature.
93040	97080	Huxley and his supporters had clear evidence of evolution in animals.
97080	102640	What they lacked was direct physical evidence to show that evolution also applied to humans.
102640	107320	The search was now on for what became known as the missing link, a fossil that was half
107320	109640	human, half ape.
109640	115080	We are, of course, all apes according to classification, but for the purpose of simplification, in
115080	120920	this video I'll refer to human apes as humans and our common ancestor with chimpanzees as
120920	122820	apes.
122820	127360	It didn't take long for this new branch of science to find its first piece of evidence.
127360	131600	Just three years before Darwin published The Origin of Species, the bones of what looked
131600	136720	like an oddly deformed human were unearthed in the Neander Valley in Germany.
136720	142200	Fossil man wasn't the missing link but it did seem to be one of our archaic ancestors.
142200	148520	In 1891 fossil bones from the first real archaic hominid, later called Homo erectus, were found
148520	154560	on Java Island and 32 years later another Homo erectus skull, Peking Man, was found
154560	155760	in China.
155760	158600	Neither of these fossils were the fabled missing link.
158600	163200	They were closer to humans than apes but they did spark the idea that modern humans may
163200	165640	have evolved in Asia.
165640	170680	Africa was also beginning to yield some valuable finds including the Taung Child, found in
170680	173260	South Africa in 1924.
173260	178280	The problem was these didn't fit with another discovery made 16 years earlier in southern
178280	180880	England, Piltdown Man.
180880	186120	But as more fossils emerged from South Africa in the 1930s it became clear that Piltdown
186120	189480	Man was the anomaly, not the Taung Child.
189480	194560	Piltdown Man just didn't make any sense, either in its physiology or its geographical
194560	195800	location.
195800	200440	It only made sense in 1953 when the hoax was revealed.
200440	204780	By then the distribution of hominid fossils had given rise to two schools of thought on
204780	211000	human origins, an African origin and a multi-regional origin, the idea that humans evolved from
211000	214640	archaic hominids in different parts of the world.
214640	220120	But over the next 40 years paleoanthropologists uncovered the motherload of hominid fossils.
254560	262880	The idea of a missing link has long been relegated to the status of a quaint 19th century
262880	264760	preoccupation.
264760	269240	Finding fossils that link humans to ancestral apes isn't the problem.
269240	274000	The problem is that East Africa has produced so many of them that paleoanthropologists
274000	279140	are having a hard time sorting out which are our direct ancestors and which are the evolutionary
279140	280660	dead ends.
280660	285580	We find what we find in most animal species, a wealth of relatives.
285580	288620	Some branched off and reached a dead end very quickly.
288620	293260	Others evolved for hundreds of thousands of years before becoming extinct.
293260	296620	So our family tree turns out to be very rich indeed.
296620	300640	It's a bit like trying to find the next of kin of an orphaned baby and coming up not
300640	306340	only with direct ancestors but also their brothers, sisters, uncles and cousins.
306340	310080	But together these hominid fossils tell a single story.
310080	315380	As we work our way forward in time, just as expected, they become less ape-like and
315380	316380	more human-like.
316380	322980	Well, no one disputes that, but what species of ape?
322980	326700	There's clear evidence that some of these apes could light fires and make tools and
326700	327980	hunt with weapons.
327980	331580	They walked on two legs, but they weren't human either.
331580	336420	They had obvious ape characteristics like arms longer than legs.
336420	341120	And why do we see a clear progression through time of more ape-like creatures disappearing
341120	346560	and more intelligent and more human-like species appearing in the sedimentary layers above?
346560	351560	We never see a species disappearing to be replaced by something less intelligent and
351560	354880	less human-like.
354880	358240	That might be true in some cases, but not in all.
358240	362700	And skull shape is only one characteristic that separates humans from apes.
362700	368040	A more slender body form, larger brain size, walking on two legs, having opposable thumbs.
368040	373420	These are all crucial human features that we see evolving gradually through time.
373420	378000	Evolution from ape characteristics to human characteristics can also be found in the smallest
378000	382840	details from the shape of the pelvis to the thickness of tooth enamel.
382840	387380	When the field of DNA opened up, paleoanthropology got its first big break.
387380	391240	This completely new field of science would either confirm one of the mythical accounts
391240	396500	of our instant creation or it would confirm the evidence of slow evolution.
396500	401620	And guess which one turned out to be right?
401620	403080	Or is it?
403080	408260	When geneticists investigated, they discovered that humans have only 46 chromosomes and all
408260	410700	the other great apes have 48.
410700	415920	So we couldn't have evolved directly from a common ape ancestor.
415920	420080	Unless two pairs of chromosomes had fused.
420080	421560	Well there's only one way to find out.
421560	425220	I'll let Dr. Ken Miller pick up the story.
425220	429320	So we can scan our genome and you know what, if we don't find that chromosome, evolution's
429320	430320	in trouble.
430320	431580	Well, guess what?
431580	433460	It's chromosome number two.
433460	436400	Mitochondrial DNA tells us even more.
436400	441460	It shows that our nearest relative in the animal kingdom is, exactly as the fossil evidence
441460	444800	predicted, a great ape, the chimpanzee.
444800	447780	And when did we last share a common ancestor?
447780	454260	Five million years ago, just before the date of the first ancestral hominid fossils.
454260	457840	Mitochondrial DNA from a Neanderthal fossil has also been analysed.
457840	462100	It's completely different to every type of modern human and it shows that humans and
462100	467900	Neanderthals last shared a common ancestor around half a million years ago.
467900	471980	Mitochondrial DNA can only be passed from mother to child and it mutates at a fairly
471980	473720	regular rate.
473720	479060	Let's say this woman's mitochondrial DNA develops a mutation and let's mark it red.
479060	484080	Her kids will share the same mutation but only the girls will pass it on.
484080	488700	Several generations later, another part of the mitochondrial DNA mutates.
488700	490840	Let's give this one a blue code.
490840	493280	Then another one mutates, a green code.
493280	495480	Then more mutations.
495480	498820	Thousands of generations later we can see a clear pattern.
498820	502460	Closely related people share a lot of similar mutation markers.
502460	507180	The less closely related they are, the fewer common mutations they share.
507180	512220	But everyone shares the red mutation which means they can all be traced back to a common
512220	514180	female ancestor.
514180	518480	And since geneticists know roughly the rate at which these mutations occur, they can work
518480	521140	out roughly when and where she lived.
521140	528700	The result coincided perfectly with the fossil evidence around 150,000 years ago in Africa.
528700	533580	I've laid out the twists and turns of the last 150 years because science doesn't move
533580	535400	in a straight line.
535400	540620	Ideas are constantly being refined, updated and amended as more evidence comes to light.
540620	543740	There are no foregone conclusions and no preconceptions.
543740	549040	Instead, we feel our way in a darkened room, collecting evidence and getting closer and
549040	552100	closer to an understanding of the layout.
552100	557220	When DNA analysis came along, it was as if a light had been switched on.
557260	561660	The understanding in the DNA evidence contradicts what we find in the fossil evidence.
561660	565460	Together they give us the broad picture of our origins.
565460	570140	In the next video, the ancestry of humans made easy, I'll show evidence of who these
570140	575020	ancestors were and how they left their homeland to conquer the world.
