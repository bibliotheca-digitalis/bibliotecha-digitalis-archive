1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,720
In previous videos I've shown evidence of how the world around us was formed, but a

2
00:00:08,720 --> 00:00:11,040
fundamental question remains.

3
00:00:11,040 --> 00:00:26,200
How did we get here?

4
00:00:26,200 --> 00:00:29,440
The void has always been filled by fanciful stories.

5
00:00:29,440 --> 00:00:34,200
The Chinese believed a dragon goddess needed someone to talk to, so she formed humans out

6
00:00:34,200 --> 00:00:36,320
of clay from a river bank.

7
00:00:36,320 --> 00:00:40,920
According to Jewish mythology, a god made a man out of clay and then fashioned a woman

8
00:00:40,920 --> 00:00:42,720
out of one of his ribs.

9
00:00:42,720 --> 00:00:47,240
Inuit mythology describes a raven god who filled the earth with pea pods, and one of

10
00:00:47,240 --> 00:00:50,760
these burst open to reveal the first man.

11
00:00:50,760 --> 00:00:56,040
But 150 years ago one book shattered these myths and opened the door to a rational and

12
00:00:56,040 --> 00:00:59,480
evidence-based understanding of our origins.

13
00:00:59,480 --> 00:01:04,640
But while Charles Darwin and Alfred Wallace jointly came up with the idea of natural selection,

14
00:01:04,640 --> 00:01:09,720
they parted company on whether this evolutionary mechanism could be applied to humans.

15
00:01:09,720 --> 00:01:14,680
Wallace formulated the idea that animals had evolved, but he couldn't compromise his belief

16
00:01:14,680 --> 00:01:17,280
that humans were the work of a deity.

17
00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:22,960
But Darwin caved to the inevitable conclusion and called it My Little Heresy.

18
00:01:22,960 --> 00:01:28,000
My Little Heresy was first expounded not by Darwin but by naturalist Thomas Huxley

19
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:33,040
in an 1863 book called Evidence as to Man's Place in Nature.

20
00:01:33,040 --> 00:01:37,080
Huxley and his supporters had clear evidence of evolution in animals.

21
00:01:37,080 --> 00:01:42,640
What they lacked was direct physical evidence to show that evolution also applied to humans.

22
00:01:42,640 --> 00:01:47,320
The search was now on for what became known as the missing link, a fossil that was half

23
00:01:47,320 --> 00:01:49,640
human, half ape.

24
00:01:49,640 --> 00:01:55,080
We are, of course, all apes according to classification, but for the purpose of simplification, in

25
00:01:55,080 --> 00:02:00,920
this video I'll refer to human apes as humans and our common ancestor with chimpanzees as

26
00:02:00,920 --> 00:02:02,820
apes.

27
00:02:02,820 --> 00:02:07,360
It didn't take long for this new branch of science to find its first piece of evidence.

28
00:02:07,360 --> 00:02:11,600
Just three years before Darwin published The Origin of Species, the bones of what looked

29
00:02:11,600 --> 00:02:16,720
like an oddly deformed human were unearthed in the Neander Valley in Germany.

30
00:02:16,720 --> 00:02:22,200
Fossil man wasn't the missing link but it did seem to be one of our archaic ancestors.

31
00:02:22,200 --> 00:02:28,520
In 1891 fossil bones from the first real archaic hominid, later called Homo erectus, were found

32
00:02:28,520 --> 00:02:34,560
on Java Island and 32 years later another Homo erectus skull, Peking Man, was found

33
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:35,760
in China.

34
00:02:35,760 --> 00:02:38,600
Neither of these fossils were the fabled missing link.

35
00:02:38,600 --> 00:02:43,200
They were closer to humans than apes but they did spark the idea that modern humans may

36
00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:45,640
have evolved in Asia.

37
00:02:45,640 --> 00:02:50,680
Africa was also beginning to yield some valuable finds including the Taung Child, found in

38
00:02:50,680 --> 00:02:53,260
South Africa in 1924.

39
00:02:53,260 --> 00:02:58,280
The problem was these didn't fit with another discovery made 16 years earlier in southern

40
00:02:58,280 --> 00:03:00,880
England, Piltdown Man.

41
00:03:00,880 --> 00:03:06,120
But as more fossils emerged from South Africa in the 1930s it became clear that Piltdown

42
00:03:06,120 --> 00:03:09,480
Man was the anomaly, not the Taung Child.

43
00:03:09,480 --> 00:03:14,560
Piltdown Man just didn't make any sense, either in its physiology or its geographical

44
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:15,800
location.

45
00:03:15,800 --> 00:03:20,440
It only made sense in 1953 when the hoax was revealed.

46
00:03:20,440 --> 00:03:24,780
By then the distribution of hominid fossils had given rise to two schools of thought on

47
00:03:24,780 --> 00:03:31,000
human origins, an African origin and a multi-regional origin, the idea that humans evolved from

48
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:34,640
archaic hominids in different parts of the world.

49
00:03:34,640 --> 00:03:40,120
But over the next 40 years paleoanthropologists uncovered the motherload of hominid fossils.

50
00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:22,880
The idea of a missing link has long been relegated to the status of a quaint 19th century

51
00:04:22,880 --> 00:04:24,760
preoccupation.

52
00:04:24,760 --> 00:04:29,240
Finding fossils that link humans to ancestral apes isn't the problem.

53
00:04:29,240 --> 00:04:34,000
The problem is that East Africa has produced so many of them that paleoanthropologists

54
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:39,140
are having a hard time sorting out which are our direct ancestors and which are the evolutionary

55
00:04:39,140 --> 00:04:40,660
dead ends.

56
00:04:40,660 --> 00:04:45,580
We find what we find in most animal species, a wealth of relatives.

57
00:04:45,580 --> 00:04:48,620
Some branched off and reached a dead end very quickly.

58
00:04:48,620 --> 00:04:53,260
Others evolved for hundreds of thousands of years before becoming extinct.

59
00:04:53,260 --> 00:04:56,620
So our family tree turns out to be very rich indeed.

60
00:04:56,620 --> 00:05:00,640
It's a bit like trying to find the next of kin of an orphaned baby and coming up not

61
00:05:00,640 --> 00:05:06,340
only with direct ancestors but also their brothers, sisters, uncles and cousins.

62
00:05:06,340 --> 00:05:10,080
But together these hominid fossils tell a single story.

63
00:05:10,080 --> 00:05:15,380
As we work our way forward in time, just as expected, they become less ape-like and

64
00:05:15,380 --> 00:05:16,380
more human-like.

65
00:05:16,380 --> 00:05:22,980
Well, no one disputes that, but what species of ape?

66
00:05:22,980 --> 00:05:26,700
There's clear evidence that some of these apes could light fires and make tools and

67
00:05:26,700 --> 00:05:27,980
hunt with weapons.

68
00:05:27,980 --> 00:05:31,580
They walked on two legs, but they weren't human either.

69
00:05:31,580 --> 00:05:36,420
They had obvious ape characteristics like arms longer than legs.

70
00:05:36,420 --> 00:05:41,120
And why do we see a clear progression through time of more ape-like creatures disappearing

71
00:05:41,120 --> 00:05:46,560
and more intelligent and more human-like species appearing in the sedimentary layers above?

72
00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:51,560
We never see a species disappearing to be replaced by something less intelligent and

73
00:05:51,560 --> 00:05:54,880
less human-like.

74
00:05:54,880 --> 00:05:58,240
That might be true in some cases, but not in all.

75
00:05:58,240 --> 00:06:02,700
And skull shape is only one characteristic that separates humans from apes.

76
00:06:02,700 --> 00:06:08,040
A more slender body form, larger brain size, walking on two legs, having opposable thumbs.

77
00:06:08,040 --> 00:06:13,420
These are all crucial human features that we see evolving gradually through time.

78
00:06:13,420 --> 00:06:18,000
Evolution from ape characteristics to human characteristics can also be found in the smallest

79
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:22,840
details from the shape of the pelvis to the thickness of tooth enamel.

80
00:06:22,840 --> 00:06:27,380
When the field of DNA opened up, paleoanthropology got its first big break.

81
00:06:27,380 --> 00:06:31,240
This completely new field of science would either confirm one of the mythical accounts

82
00:06:31,240 --> 00:06:36,500
of our instant creation or it would confirm the evidence of slow evolution.

83
00:06:36,500 --> 00:06:41,620
And guess which one turned out to be right?

84
00:06:41,620 --> 00:06:43,080
Or is it?

85
00:06:43,080 --> 00:06:48,260
When geneticists investigated, they discovered that humans have only 46 chromosomes and all

86
00:06:48,260 --> 00:06:50,700
the other great apes have 48.

87
00:06:50,700 --> 00:06:55,920
So we couldn't have evolved directly from a common ape ancestor.

88
00:06:55,920 --> 00:07:00,080
Unless two pairs of chromosomes had fused.

89
00:07:00,080 --> 00:07:01,560
Well there's only one way to find out.

90
00:07:01,560 --> 00:07:05,220
I'll let Dr. Ken Miller pick up the story.

91
00:07:05,220 --> 00:07:09,320
So we can scan our genome and you know what, if we don't find that chromosome, evolution's

92
00:07:09,320 --> 00:07:10,320
in trouble.

93
00:07:10,320 --> 00:07:11,580
Well, guess what?

94
00:07:11,580 --> 00:07:13,460
It's chromosome number two.

95
00:07:13,460 --> 00:07:16,400
Mitochondrial DNA tells us even more.

96
00:07:16,400 --> 00:07:21,460
It shows that our nearest relative in the animal kingdom is, exactly as the fossil evidence

97
00:07:21,460 --> 00:07:24,800
predicted, a great ape, the chimpanzee.

98
00:07:24,800 --> 00:07:27,780
And when did we last share a common ancestor?

99
00:07:27,780 --> 00:07:34,260
Five million years ago, just before the date of the first ancestral hominid fossils.

100
00:07:34,260 --> 00:07:37,840
Mitochondrial DNA from a Neanderthal fossil has also been analysed.

101
00:07:37,840 --> 00:07:42,100
It's completely different to every type of modern human and it shows that humans and

102
00:07:42,100 --> 00:07:47,900
Neanderthals last shared a common ancestor around half a million years ago.

103
00:07:47,900 --> 00:07:51,980
Mitochondrial DNA can only be passed from mother to child and it mutates at a fairly

104
00:07:51,980 --> 00:07:53,720
regular rate.

105
00:07:53,720 --> 00:07:59,060
Let's say this woman's mitochondrial DNA develops a mutation and let's mark it red.

106
00:07:59,060 --> 00:08:04,080
Her kids will share the same mutation but only the girls will pass it on.

107
00:08:04,080 --> 00:08:08,700
Several generations later, another part of the mitochondrial DNA mutates.

108
00:08:08,700 --> 00:08:10,840
Let's give this one a blue code.

109
00:08:10,840 --> 00:08:13,280
Then another one mutates, a green code.

110
00:08:13,280 --> 00:08:15,480
Then more mutations.

111
00:08:15,480 --> 00:08:18,820
Thousands of generations later we can see a clear pattern.

112
00:08:18,820 --> 00:08:22,460
Closely related people share a lot of similar mutation markers.

113
00:08:22,460 --> 00:08:27,180
The less closely related they are, the fewer common mutations they share.

114
00:08:27,180 --> 00:08:32,220
But everyone shares the red mutation which means they can all be traced back to a common

115
00:08:32,220 --> 00:08:34,180
female ancestor.

116
00:08:34,180 --> 00:08:38,480
And since geneticists know roughly the rate at which these mutations occur, they can work

117
00:08:38,480 --> 00:08:41,140
out roughly when and where she lived.

118
00:08:41,140 --> 00:08:48,700
The result coincided perfectly with the fossil evidence around 150,000 years ago in Africa.

119
00:08:48,700 --> 00:08:53,580
I've laid out the twists and turns of the last 150 years because science doesn't move

120
00:08:53,580 --> 00:08:55,400
in a straight line.

121
00:08:55,400 --> 00:09:00,620
Ideas are constantly being refined, updated and amended as more evidence comes to light.

122
00:09:00,620 --> 00:09:03,740
There are no foregone conclusions and no preconceptions.

123
00:09:03,740 --> 00:09:09,040
Instead, we feel our way in a darkened room, collecting evidence and getting closer and

124
00:09:09,040 --> 00:09:12,100
closer to an understanding of the layout.

125
00:09:12,100 --> 00:09:17,220
When DNA analysis came along, it was as if a light had been switched on.

126
00:09:17,260 --> 00:09:21,660
The understanding in the DNA evidence contradicts what we find in the fossil evidence.

127
00:09:21,660 --> 00:09:25,460
Together they give us the broad picture of our origins.

128
00:09:25,460 --> 00:09:30,140
In the next video, the ancestry of humans made easy, I'll show evidence of who these

129
00:09:30,140 --> 00:09:35,020
ancestors were and how they left their homeland to conquer the world.
