00:00.000 --> 00:08.720
In previous videos I've shown evidence of how the world around us was formed, but a

00:08.720 --> 00:11.040
fundamental question remains.

00:11.040 --> 00:26.200
How did we get here?

00:26.200 --> 00:29.440
The void has always been filled by fanciful stories.

00:29.440 --> 00:34.200
The Chinese believed a dragon goddess needed someone to talk to, so she formed humans out

00:34.200 --> 00:36.320
of clay from a river bank.

00:36.320 --> 00:40.920
According to Jewish mythology, a god made a man out of clay and then fashioned a woman

00:40.920 --> 00:42.720
out of one of his ribs.

00:42.720 --> 00:47.240
Inuit mythology describes a raven god who filled the earth with pea pods, and one of

00:47.240 --> 00:50.760
these burst open to reveal the first man.

00:50.760 --> 00:56.040
But 150 years ago one book shattered these myths and opened the door to a rational and

00:56.040 --> 00:59.480
evidence-based understanding of our origins.

00:59.480 --> 01:04.640
But while Charles Darwin and Alfred Wallace jointly came up with the idea of natural selection,

01:04.640 --> 01:09.720
they parted company on whether this evolutionary mechanism could be applied to humans.

01:09.720 --> 01:14.680
Wallace formulated the idea that animals had evolved, but he couldn't compromise his belief

01:14.680 --> 01:17.280
that humans were the work of a deity.

01:17.280 --> 01:22.960
But Darwin caved to the inevitable conclusion and called it My Little Heresy.

01:22.960 --> 01:28.000
My Little Heresy was first expounded not by Darwin but by naturalist Thomas Huxley

01:28.000 --> 01:33.040
in an 1863 book called Evidence as to Man's Place in Nature.

01:33.040 --> 01:37.080
Huxley and his supporters had clear evidence of evolution in animals.

01:37.080 --> 01:42.640
What they lacked was direct physical evidence to show that evolution also applied to humans.

01:42.640 --> 01:47.320
The search was now on for what became known as the missing link, a fossil that was half

01:47.320 --> 01:49.640
human, half ape.

01:49.640 --> 01:55.080
We are, of course, all apes according to classification, but for the purpose of simplification, in

01:55.080 --> 02:00.920
this video I'll refer to human apes as humans and our common ancestor with chimpanzees as

02:00.920 --> 02:02.820
apes.

02:02.820 --> 02:07.360
It didn't take long for this new branch of science to find its first piece of evidence.

02:07.360 --> 02:11.600
Just three years before Darwin published The Origin of Species, the bones of what looked

02:11.600 --> 02:16.720
like an oddly deformed human were unearthed in the Neander Valley in Germany.

02:16.720 --> 02:22.200
Fossil man wasn't the missing link but it did seem to be one of our archaic ancestors.

02:22.200 --> 02:28.520
In 1891 fossil bones from the first real archaic hominid, later called Homo erectus, were found

02:28.520 --> 02:34.560
on Java Island and 32 years later another Homo erectus skull, Peking Man, was found

02:34.560 --> 02:35.760
in China.

02:35.760 --> 02:38.600
Neither of these fossils were the fabled missing link.

02:38.600 --> 02:43.200
They were closer to humans than apes but they did spark the idea that modern humans may

02:43.200 --> 02:45.640
have evolved in Asia.

02:45.640 --> 02:50.680
Africa was also beginning to yield some valuable finds including the Taung Child, found in

02:50.680 --> 02:53.260
South Africa in 1924.

02:53.260 --> 02:58.280
The problem was these didn't fit with another discovery made 16 years earlier in southern

02:58.280 --> 03:00.880
England, Piltdown Man.

03:00.880 --> 03:06.120
But as more fossils emerged from South Africa in the 1930s it became clear that Piltdown

03:06.120 --> 03:09.480
Man was the anomaly, not the Taung Child.

03:09.480 --> 03:14.560
Piltdown Man just didn't make any sense, either in its physiology or its geographical

03:14.560 --> 03:15.800
location.

03:15.800 --> 03:20.440
It only made sense in 1953 when the hoax was revealed.

03:20.440 --> 03:24.780
By then the distribution of hominid fossils had given rise to two schools of thought on

03:24.780 --> 03:31.000
human origins, an African origin and a multi-regional origin, the idea that humans evolved from

03:31.000 --> 03:34.640
archaic hominids in different parts of the world.

03:34.640 --> 03:40.120
But over the next 40 years paleoanthropologists uncovered the motherload of hominid fossils.

04:14.560 --> 04:22.880
The idea of a missing link has long been relegated to the status of a quaint 19th century

04:22.880 --> 04:24.760
preoccupation.

04:24.760 --> 04:29.240
Finding fossils that link humans to ancestral apes isn't the problem.

04:29.240 --> 04:34.000
The problem is that East Africa has produced so many of them that paleoanthropologists

04:34.000 --> 04:39.140
are having a hard time sorting out which are our direct ancestors and which are the evolutionary

04:39.140 --> 04:40.660
dead ends.

04:40.660 --> 04:45.580
We find what we find in most animal species, a wealth of relatives.

04:45.580 --> 04:48.620
Some branched off and reached a dead end very quickly.

04:48.620 --> 04:53.260
Others evolved for hundreds of thousands of years before becoming extinct.

04:53.260 --> 04:56.620
So our family tree turns out to be very rich indeed.

04:56.620 --> 05:00.640
It's a bit like trying to find the next of kin of an orphaned baby and coming up not

05:00.640 --> 05:06.340
only with direct ancestors but also their brothers, sisters, uncles and cousins.

05:06.340 --> 05:10.080
But together these hominid fossils tell a single story.

05:10.080 --> 05:15.380
As we work our way forward in time, just as expected, they become less ape-like and

05:15.380 --> 05:16.380
more human-like.

05:16.380 --> 05:22.980
Well, no one disputes that, but what species of ape?

05:22.980 --> 05:26.700
There's clear evidence that some of these apes could light fires and make tools and

05:26.700 --> 05:27.980
hunt with weapons.

05:27.980 --> 05:31.580
They walked on two legs, but they weren't human either.

05:31.580 --> 05:36.420
They had obvious ape characteristics like arms longer than legs.

05:36.420 --> 05:41.120
And why do we see a clear progression through time of more ape-like creatures disappearing

05:41.120 --> 05:46.560
and more intelligent and more human-like species appearing in the sedimentary layers above?

05:46.560 --> 05:51.560
We never see a species disappearing to be replaced by something less intelligent and

05:51.560 --> 05:54.880
less human-like.

05:54.880 --> 05:58.240
That might be true in some cases, but not in all.

05:58.240 --> 06:02.700
And skull shape is only one characteristic that separates humans from apes.

06:02.700 --> 06:08.040
A more slender body form, larger brain size, walking on two legs, having opposable thumbs.

06:08.040 --> 06:13.420
These are all crucial human features that we see evolving gradually through time.

06:13.420 --> 06:18.000
Evolution from ape characteristics to human characteristics can also be found in the smallest

06:18.000 --> 06:22.840
details from the shape of the pelvis to the thickness of tooth enamel.

06:22.840 --> 06:27.380
When the field of DNA opened up, paleoanthropology got its first big break.

06:27.380 --> 06:31.240
This completely new field of science would either confirm one of the mythical accounts

06:31.240 --> 06:36.500
of our instant creation or it would confirm the evidence of slow evolution.

06:36.500 --> 06:41.620
And guess which one turned out to be right?

06:41.620 --> 06:43.080
Or is it?

06:43.080 --> 06:48.260
When geneticists investigated, they discovered that humans have only 46 chromosomes and all

06:48.260 --> 06:50.700
the other great apes have 48.

06:50.700 --> 06:55.920
So we couldn't have evolved directly from a common ape ancestor.

06:55.920 --> 07:00.080
Unless two pairs of chromosomes had fused.

07:00.080 --> 07:01.560
Well there's only one way to find out.

07:01.560 --> 07:05.220
I'll let Dr. Ken Miller pick up the story.

07:05.220 --> 07:09.320
So we can scan our genome and you know what, if we don't find that chromosome, evolution's

07:09.320 --> 07:10.320
in trouble.

07:10.320 --> 07:11.580
Well, guess what?

07:11.580 --> 07:13.460
It's chromosome number two.

07:13.460 --> 07:16.400
Mitochondrial DNA tells us even more.

07:16.400 --> 07:21.460
It shows that our nearest relative in the animal kingdom is, exactly as the fossil evidence

07:21.460 --> 07:24.800
predicted, a great ape, the chimpanzee.

07:24.800 --> 07:27.780
And when did we last share a common ancestor?

07:27.780 --> 07:34.260
Five million years ago, just before the date of the first ancestral hominid fossils.

07:34.260 --> 07:37.840
Mitochondrial DNA from a Neanderthal fossil has also been analysed.

07:37.840 --> 07:42.100
It's completely different to every type of modern human and it shows that humans and

07:42.100 --> 07:47.900
Neanderthals last shared a common ancestor around half a million years ago.

07:47.900 --> 07:51.980
Mitochondrial DNA can only be passed from mother to child and it mutates at a fairly

07:51.980 --> 07:53.720
regular rate.

07:53.720 --> 07:59.060
Let's say this woman's mitochondrial DNA develops a mutation and let's mark it red.

07:59.060 --> 08:04.080
Her kids will share the same mutation but only the girls will pass it on.

08:04.080 --> 08:08.700
Several generations later, another part of the mitochondrial DNA mutates.

08:08.700 --> 08:10.840
Let's give this one a blue code.

08:10.840 --> 08:13.280
Then another one mutates, a green code.

08:13.280 --> 08:15.480
Then more mutations.

08:15.480 --> 08:18.820
Thousands of generations later we can see a clear pattern.

08:18.820 --> 08:22.460
Closely related people share a lot of similar mutation markers.

08:22.460 --> 08:27.180
The less closely related they are, the fewer common mutations they share.

08:27.180 --> 08:32.220
But everyone shares the red mutation which means they can all be traced back to a common

08:32.220 --> 08:34.180
female ancestor.

08:34.180 --> 08:38.480
And since geneticists know roughly the rate at which these mutations occur, they can work

08:38.480 --> 08:41.140
out roughly when and where she lived.

08:41.140 --> 08:48.700
The result coincided perfectly with the fossil evidence around 150,000 years ago in Africa.

08:48.700 --> 08:53.580
I've laid out the twists and turns of the last 150 years because science doesn't move

08:53.580 --> 08:55.400
in a straight line.

08:55.400 --> 09:00.620
Ideas are constantly being refined, updated and amended as more evidence comes to light.

09:00.620 --> 09:03.740
There are no foregone conclusions and no preconceptions.

09:03.740 --> 09:09.040
Instead, we feel our way in a darkened room, collecting evidence and getting closer and

09:09.040 --> 09:12.100
closer to an understanding of the layout.

09:12.100 --> 09:17.220
When DNA analysis came along, it was as if a light had been switched on.

09:17.260 --> 09:21.660
The understanding in the DNA evidence contradicts what we find in the fossil evidence.

09:21.660 --> 09:25.460
Together they give us the broad picture of our origins.

09:25.460 --> 09:30.140
In the next video, the ancestry of humans made easy, I'll show evidence of who these

09:30.140 --> 09:35.020
ancestors were and how they left their homeland to conquer the world.
