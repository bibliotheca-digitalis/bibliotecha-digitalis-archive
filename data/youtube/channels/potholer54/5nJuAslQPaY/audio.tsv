0	3080	Snow in Britain? In winter?
3080	7640	The Internet, of course, is awash with theories about how and why this unprecedented event
7640	8880	is happening.
8880	12340	Now I hope you all know me well enough by now to know that the first thing I do when
12340	18960	confronted with Internet hysteria is, that's right, track the information back to its source.
18960	23140	Most Internet sites quote other Internet sites that quote other Internet sites.
23140	26780	It's the electronic adult equivalent of schoolyard gossip.
26780	30340	And when we follow the trail right back, we find that all these assertions come from
30340	35260	just one source, a theoretical physicist called Gianluigi Zangari.
35260	39780	In July, he published a paper on the website of something called the Geophysical Association
39780	41020	of Italy.
41020	45160	Out of the hundreds of scientific papers I've read in my professional career, this has to
45160	49820	be one of the shortest and most amateurish outside of creationist literature.
49820	53320	It would be laughable to even presume it was peer-reviewed.
53320	56380	It's so brief, I can sum it up very quickly.
56380	61260	Zangari looked at satellite images and concluded that the loop current in the Gulf Stream must
61260	62860	have slowed down.
62860	67340	Since observations have shown us that sea currents often speed up or slow down, is this
67340	69300	anything unusual in the Gulf?
69300	70540	Has it happened before?
70540	72320	Is it part of a cycle?
72320	75060	Zangari doesn't spend any time finding that out.
75060	79500	He's already moved on and the rest of the paper consists of conjecture, possibilities
79500	81900	and armchair speculation.
81900	86500	It might be plausible, he writes, that the BP oil spill caused this slowdown and that
86500	93180	it's reasonable to foresee instabilities which in turn may interrupt the global climate.
93180	95300	What evidence is there for any of this?
95300	96300	None.
96300	98220	It's just Zangari's ponderings.
98220	103260	But the Chinese whispers of the internet playground turn these plausibles and maybes into alarming
103260	108220	certainties about how scientists have discovered a disruption of the global climate.
108220	112780	There's even a YouTube guru who calls himself the Earl of Sterling, spreading this alarmist
112780	113780	crap.
113780	118580	I call this alarmist because this is the correct definition of the term alarmist.
118580	122620	We're not dealing with research published in respected peer-reviewed journals, warning
122620	127060	of earthquakes, health risks and climate change and backed by solid evidence.
127060	132620	These are people who make up scary predictions based on exaggerations or inactive imagination.
132620	134620	In a radio interview, the Earl said this.
134620	137980	But then he said, have you got confirmation from NOAA?
137980	139220	A good question.
139220	141020	What does NOAA think of your ideas?
141020	146340	I mean, it would be good to have some actual science-based confirmation in the way of published
146340	147340	research.
147340	151080	As I've said before, we don't research something as complex as the global climate, just by
151080	153860	looking out the window to see what the weather's like.
153860	159860	And I said, with all due respect, if you want confirmation, look outside the window.
159860	164140	Ah, if that's the best you can come up with, we don't need to waste any more time on your
164140	165140	theory.
165140	169440	Let's move on to the other extreme of this so-called debate, the carefully formulated
169440	173820	theory called, it's snowing outside so the world can't be warming.
173820	177740	Every time winter comes around, whether it's a blizzard in New York or a snow flurry in
177740	182780	London, you can bet that someone will say, whatever happened to global warming?
182780	186900	I thought these so-called scientists had decreed that the UK would have no more snow and that
186900	191860	the climate would resemble the south of France, said one post in the Daily Mail.
191860	194700	Scientists were saying there would be no more snow in Britain.
194700	196460	When was this piece of research published?
196460	201620	I tried to keep up with the scientific journals but obviously I missed this one, so once again
201620	204340	let's track this down to a source.
204340	208580	It didn't take long to discover that this didn't come from any scientific research,
208580	213540	but a story in Britain's independent newspaper ten years ago titled, Snowfalls are now just
213540	215220	a thing of the past.
215220	218180	And where did the independent get this nonsense from?
218180	222940	Well I'll come to that in a minute, but first let's check the independent's claim.
222940	227340	Now it's labelled environment, and it's supposed to be about weather patterns and climate,
227340	229660	which means it's a science story.
229660	234020	But the author was someone called Charles Onions, who, no surprise for guessing, is
234020	236100	not a science journalist.
236100	240020	No kidding, what I'm about to read you comes verbatim from the story.
240020	243020	Cue teary music and a silly voiceover.
243020	250920	Sledgers, snowmen, snowballs, and the excitement at waking to find that the stuff has settled
250920	256580	outside are all a rapidly diminishing part of Britain's culture.
256580	261840	A generation was growing up without experiencing one of the great joys and privileges of living
261840	266360	in this part of the world, open air skating.
266360	270520	The chances are certainly now stacked against the sort of heavy snowfall in cities that
270520	275800	inspired impressionist painters such as Sisley and the 19th century poet laureate Robert
275800	282240	Bridges, who wrote in London Snow of it, stealthily and perpetually settling and loosely
282240	283240	lying.
283240	290280	Not anymore, it seems.
290280	292360	Oh cut before I throw up.
292360	296760	As I said in my last video, too often the media seem to think stories about the environment
296760	300860	are touchy-feely human interest pieces rather than science.
300860	305120	So instead of assigning the snow-free Britain story to a science journalist, who might have
305120	309440	determined that it was crap, they give it to a journalist who apparently specialises
309440	311620	in human rights issues.
311620	316260	And instead of citing scientific studies and peer-reviewed research papers, Onions gives
316260	322400	us quotes from Hamley's Toy Store, the Fenland Indoor Speed Skating Club, a local historian,
322400	328500	an anthropologist and, oh yes, a scientist, Dr David Viner of the Climatic Research Unit.
328500	332760	No research was cited in support of it, including Viner's.
332760	335280	Someone wrote to me saying Viner should issue a retraction.
335280	340880	Yes, I'd like him to go even further, a retraction and an explanation.
340880	345720	But Viner has been surprisingly silent on this ever since snowmen, sledges and snowballs
345720	349160	unexpectedly appeared on his doorstep last November.
349160	353600	I wrote to him through the British Council, where he now works, and got this rather lame
353600	358160	reply, filtered through the British Council's Public Relations Department.
358160	362400	Over the past decade, climate science has moved on considerably, and there is now more
362400	366800	understanding about the impact climate change will have on weather patterns in the coming
366800	368120	years.
368120	372920	It has indeed moved on, but not to the extent that ten years ago researchers thought snow
372920	377400	would be a rarity within a few years, and within a few years they completely changed
377400	378400	their minds.
378400	383880	I can't find anything in the scientific literature ten years ago that supports Viner's statement,
383880	389280	and his unwillingness to defend the rare snow idea by citing any can only lead to the conclusion
389280	391240	that there isn't any.
391240	396560	Apart from Viner, Onions refers to only one other scientist but doesn't quote him at all.
396560	400720	Onions writes, David Parker at the Hadley Centre for Climate Prediction and Research
400720	407200	in Berkshire says, ultimately, British children could have only virtual experience of snow.
407200	409320	No time scale is given.
409320	412960	Ultimately could mean 100 or 150 years from now.
412960	418320	As well as an explanation from Viner, I think we also deserve an explanation from the Independent.
418320	423260	If this is supposed to be science news, why was a science reporter not assigned?
423260	427940	Why wasn't a single scientific paper cited in support of the story's premise?
427940	432280	Why wasn't it corroborated by climatologists who were actually doing research into European
432280	433660	weather patterns?
433660	437920	Because the Independent's claim bears no relation to anything in the scientific literature at
437920	442880	the time, and it's the scientific literature that represents our knowledge of science,
442880	445040	not quotes in the popular press.
445040	449080	If Onions or his editor had bothered to check, they would have found a wealth of research
449080	454480	on European weather patterns, none of which predicted an end to Sledgers, snowmen, snowballs
454480	456200	and the excitement of waking to finance.
456200	458480	All right, all right, I've just had lunch.
458480	462940	A number of papers written in the late 1990s showed that warm and cold winters in Northern
462940	467360	Europe are cyclical and dependent on two atmospheric phenomena.
467360	471440	One of them, the North Atlantic Oscillation, is characterised by a permanent state of high
471440	475160	pressure over the Azores and low pressure over Iceland.
475160	479760	If the difference is small, the NAO is said to be in a negative phase and Northern European
479760	481280	winters are cold.
481280	486000	If the difference in pressure increases, the NAO goes into a positive phase and winters
486000	487400	are warmer.
487400	491560	The reason for this is that the difference in pressure drives westerly winds.
491560	499120	1947 and 1963 saw particularly cold winters in Britain, just like 2009 and 2010, and all
499160	503520	of them coincided with negative phases of the NAO.
503520	509040	The warm winters of the 1990s were associated with positive phases at the Oscillation.
509040	514640	In 1997, Hurrell and Van Loon wrote this in a paper published in Climate Change.
514640	518840	Recent decadal changes in temperature and precipitation are related to pronounced changes
518840	524320	over the past 20 years in the wintertime atmospheric circulation over the ocean basins of the Northern
524320	525960	Hemisphere.
525960	530160	So Onions' assertion that scientists were attributing warmer winters to global climate
530160	532600	change was pure bunkum.
532600	536520	Some scientists may have been, who knows, but climatologists who were actually doing
536520	539500	the research were much more circumspect.
539500	545280	The uncertainty at the time was neatly summed up in the same paper by Hurrell and Van Loon.
545280	549600	Whether the observed changes are in response to greenhouse gas forcing or whether the changes
549600	555360	are part of a natural decadal timescale variation is difficult to assess and is a matter of
555360	557540	much debate.
557540	562800	Whatever the influence of global warming, no published paper concluded that the NAO
562800	567840	was dead and that cold winters would become a rarity in Britain within a few years.
567840	571960	The second major influence is something called the Arctic Oscillation, which was also being
571960	574720	researched in the late 1990s.
574720	580000	According to Thompson and Wallace in a study published in 1998, the leading empirical orthogonal
580000	584040	function of the wintertime sea level pressure field is more strongly coupled to surface
584040	589380	air temperature fluctuations over the Eurasian continent than the NAO.
589380	593920	In plain English, this means that a fluctuating weather pattern called the Arctic Oscillation
593920	598000	has even more influence than the NAO.
598000	601860	Researchers now believe that both are linked, working together to bring extreme warm and
601860	606440	cold winters to northern Europe in cycles that run over several decades.
606440	611000	As a science journalist rather than a climatologist, one of the ways I can determine the importance
611000	616280	and influence of these papers is to see how many times they have been cited by other researchers.
616280	623360	In other words, how many other studies use the results to help further their research?
623360	627320	But the papers I have quoted have each been cited around a thousand times.
627320	630560	It would have been impossible for the independent to have missed them.
630560	634620	Of course, other factors can interrupt or exaggerate the effects of these natural cycles
634620	639200	– the warming effect of carbon dioxide, the cooling effect of the solar cycle and
639200	641920	the cooling effect of particulates and aerosols.
641920	646800	To that, we now have to add one more factor – the reduction in Arctic sea ice.
646800	651000	A capping of sea ice tends to stop heat escaping from the ocean underneath.
651000	655200	A recently published paper by Petakov and Semenov found that when there is less ice
655200	661020	on the Barents and Karas seas, the Arctic Ocean gives up heat and warms the troposphere.
661020	666180	This forms an anticyclone, a high pressure area over the Arctic that sends cold easterly
666180	668320	winds across northern Europe.
668560	671920	Before critics of climate science rushed to their keyboards to tell me this is just a
671920	677000	hurried and belated excuse to blame global warming for the severe winter weather, let
677000	681160	me point out that this paper was submitted in November 2009.
681160	687200	So the research was done before the severe winter of 2009-2010 and well before the severe
687200	692680	weather Europe is currently experiencing in 2010-2011.
692680	696520	One of the problems is that when people outside the field of science first became aware of
696520	700960	global warming in the 1990s, they assumed that from that point on everything would
700960	702440	start to get warmer.
702440	707560	A headline in Britain's Sun newspaper, again not the best source of science news, predicted
707560	709920	Acosta del Manchester.
709920	714240	When Britons experienced the warm winters of the late 1990s, they assumed this was now
714240	715720	the new climate.
715720	718560	And so did a lot of journalists, it seems.
718560	723560	There was also an assumption that global warming meant every part of the planet would get warmer.
723600	728480	But that's not the case either, which is why the scientific term is climate change.
728480	732640	So to the guy who wrote this post, and the people who persistently put these posts on
732640	737320	my channel, scientists haven't recently been calling it climate change at all.
737320	741320	The term has been in use for over a century, which is why we have the Intergovernmental
741320	747020	Panel on Climate Change and the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change.
747020	752200	The term global warming was a colloquialism coined in the late 1970s that specifically
752200	755560	refers to rising average global temperatures.
755560	759980	Petikov and Semenov's paper shows why the two terms shouldn't be confused.
759980	765200	As the planet warms up, not every regional climate and every season will experience increases
765200	766720	in temperature.
766720	771120	By way of illustration, here's the temperature map of Europe, showing the extreme below average
771120	774040	temperatures in November 2010.
774040	778820	But if we zoom out from that, we can see that the rest of the northern latitudes were experiencing
778820	781120	above average temperatures.
781120	786040	So throughout this video series, I used the term climate change to mean climate change,
786040	789040	and global warming to mean global warming.
789040	793920	If you think one term has replaced the other as part of a conspiracy to fool us, I suggest
793920	798840	you find out the difference and see how they're used in the scientific literature.
798840	803640	So why hasn't the climate models showed us that there would be snow in winters?
803640	806840	Answer, climate models have shown us exactly that.
806840	810440	Well, it's hardly surprising that people don't read the research that predicted the
810440	815040	deep chill, preferring instead to read fluffy stories about children never knowing the joys
815040	816520	of snow.
816520	819200	One's hard, the other's easy.
819200	824480	So now the no snow myth joins the other myths attributed to scientists, that they predicted
824480	829120	global cooling in the 1970s and an ice age in the 1990s.
829120	832280	You'll find debunks of these in my other videos.
832280	835800	But the last laugh really has to go to poor old Charles Onions.
835800	840240	Having given us the no more snow in winter story in The Independent ten years ago, he's
840240	845920	recently been reporting for the news wire AFP on, guess what, the paralysis at Charles
845920	848640	de Gaulle Airport due to heavy snow.
848640	853720	It could only be more ironic if he was reporting on British kids having fun with their toboggans.
870240	871240	Thank you.
871240	871240
