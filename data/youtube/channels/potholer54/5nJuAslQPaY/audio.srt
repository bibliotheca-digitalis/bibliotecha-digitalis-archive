1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,080
Snow in Britain? In winter?

2
00:00:03,080 --> 00:00:07,640
The Internet, of course, is awash with theories about how and why this unprecedented event

3
00:00:07,640 --> 00:00:08,880
is happening.

4
00:00:08,880 --> 00:00:12,340
Now I hope you all know me well enough by now to know that the first thing I do when

5
00:00:12,340 --> 00:00:18,960
confronted with Internet hysteria is, that's right, track the information back to its source.

6
00:00:18,960 --> 00:00:23,140
Most Internet sites quote other Internet sites that quote other Internet sites.

7
00:00:23,140 --> 00:00:26,780
It's the electronic adult equivalent of schoolyard gossip.

8
00:00:26,780 --> 00:00:30,340
And when we follow the trail right back, we find that all these assertions come from

9
00:00:30,340 --> 00:00:35,260
just one source, a theoretical physicist called Gianluigi Zangari.

10
00:00:35,260 --> 00:00:39,780
In July, he published a paper on the website of something called the Geophysical Association

11
00:00:39,780 --> 00:00:41,020
of Italy.

12
00:00:41,020 --> 00:00:45,160
Out of the hundreds of scientific papers I've read in my professional career, this has to

13
00:00:45,160 --> 00:00:49,820
be one of the shortest and most amateurish outside of creationist literature.

14
00:00:49,820 --> 00:00:53,320
It would be laughable to even presume it was peer-reviewed.

15
00:00:53,320 --> 00:00:56,380
It's so brief, I can sum it up very quickly.

16
00:00:56,380 --> 00:01:01,260
Zangari looked at satellite images and concluded that the loop current in the Gulf Stream must

17
00:01:01,260 --> 00:01:02,860
have slowed down.

18
00:01:02,860 --> 00:01:07,340
Since observations have shown us that sea currents often speed up or slow down, is this

19
00:01:07,340 --> 00:01:09,300
anything unusual in the Gulf?

20
00:01:09,300 --> 00:01:10,540
Has it happened before?

21
00:01:10,540 --> 00:01:12,320
Is it part of a cycle?

22
00:01:12,320 --> 00:01:15,060
Zangari doesn't spend any time finding that out.

23
00:01:15,060 --> 00:01:19,500
He's already moved on and the rest of the paper consists of conjecture, possibilities

24
00:01:19,500 --> 00:01:21,900
and armchair speculation.

25
00:01:21,900 --> 00:01:26,500
It might be plausible, he writes, that the BP oil spill caused this slowdown and that

26
00:01:26,500 --> 00:01:33,180
it's reasonable to foresee instabilities which in turn may interrupt the global climate.

27
00:01:33,180 --> 00:01:35,300
What evidence is there for any of this?

28
00:01:35,300 --> 00:01:36,300
None.

29
00:01:36,300 --> 00:01:38,220
It's just Zangari's ponderings.

30
00:01:38,220 --> 00:01:43,260
But the Chinese whispers of the internet playground turn these plausibles and maybes into alarming

31
00:01:43,260 --> 00:01:48,220
certainties about how scientists have discovered a disruption of the global climate.

32
00:01:48,220 --> 00:01:52,780
There's even a YouTube guru who calls himself the Earl of Sterling, spreading this alarmist

33
00:01:52,780 --> 00:01:53,780
crap.

34
00:01:53,780 --> 00:01:58,580
I call this alarmist because this is the correct definition of the term alarmist.

35
00:01:58,580 --> 00:02:02,620
We're not dealing with research published in respected peer-reviewed journals, warning

36
00:02:02,620 --> 00:02:07,060
of earthquakes, health risks and climate change and backed by solid evidence.

37
00:02:07,060 --> 00:02:12,620
These are people who make up scary predictions based on exaggerations or inactive imagination.

38
00:02:12,620 --> 00:02:14,620
In a radio interview, the Earl said this.

39
00:02:14,620 --> 00:02:17,980
But then he said, have you got confirmation from NOAA?

40
00:02:17,980 --> 00:02:19,220
A good question.

41
00:02:19,220 --> 00:02:21,020
What does NOAA think of your ideas?

42
00:02:21,020 --> 00:02:26,340
I mean, it would be good to have some actual science-based confirmation in the way of published

43
00:02:26,340 --> 00:02:27,340
research.

44
00:02:27,340 --> 00:02:31,080
As I've said before, we don't research something as complex as the global climate, just by

45
00:02:31,080 --> 00:02:33,860
looking out the window to see what the weather's like.

46
00:02:33,860 --> 00:02:39,860
And I said, with all due respect, if you want confirmation, look outside the window.

47
00:02:39,860 --> 00:02:44,140
Ah, if that's the best you can come up with, we don't need to waste any more time on your

48
00:02:44,140 --> 00:02:45,140
theory.

49
00:02:45,140 --> 00:02:49,440
Let's move on to the other extreme of this so-called debate, the carefully formulated

50
00:02:49,440 --> 00:02:53,820
theory called, it's snowing outside so the world can't be warming.

51
00:02:53,820 --> 00:02:57,740
Every time winter comes around, whether it's a blizzard in New York or a snow flurry in

52
00:02:57,740 --> 00:03:02,780
London, you can bet that someone will say, whatever happened to global warming?

53
00:03:02,780 --> 00:03:06,900
I thought these so-called scientists had decreed that the UK would have no more snow and that

54
00:03:06,900 --> 00:03:11,860
the climate would resemble the south of France, said one post in the Daily Mail.

55
00:03:11,860 --> 00:03:14,700
Scientists were saying there would be no more snow in Britain.

56
00:03:14,700 --> 00:03:16,460
When was this piece of research published?

57
00:03:16,460 --> 00:03:21,620
I tried to keep up with the scientific journals but obviously I missed this one, so once again

58
00:03:21,620 --> 00:03:24,340
let's track this down to a source.

59
00:03:24,340 --> 00:03:28,580
It didn't take long to discover that this didn't come from any scientific research,

60
00:03:28,580 --> 00:03:33,540
but a story in Britain's independent newspaper ten years ago titled, Snowfalls are now just

61
00:03:33,540 --> 00:03:35,220
a thing of the past.

62
00:03:35,220 --> 00:03:38,180
And where did the independent get this nonsense from?

63
00:03:38,180 --> 00:03:42,940
Well I'll come to that in a minute, but first let's check the independent's claim.

64
00:03:42,940 --> 00:03:47,340
Now it's labelled environment, and it's supposed to be about weather patterns and climate,

65
00:03:47,340 --> 00:03:49,660
which means it's a science story.

66
00:03:49,660 --> 00:03:54,020
But the author was someone called Charles Onions, who, no surprise for guessing, is

67
00:03:54,020 --> 00:03:56,100
not a science journalist.

68
00:03:56,100 --> 00:04:00,020
No kidding, what I'm about to read you comes verbatim from the story.

69
00:04:00,020 --> 00:04:03,020
Cue teary music and a silly voiceover.

70
00:04:03,020 --> 00:04:10,920
Sledgers, snowmen, snowballs, and the excitement at waking to find that the stuff has settled

71
00:04:10,920 --> 00:04:16,580
outside are all a rapidly diminishing part of Britain's culture.

72
00:04:16,580 --> 00:04:21,840
A generation was growing up without experiencing one of the great joys and privileges of living

73
00:04:21,840 --> 00:04:26,360
in this part of the world, open air skating.

74
00:04:26,360 --> 00:04:30,520
The chances are certainly now stacked against the sort of heavy snowfall in cities that

75
00:04:30,520 --> 00:04:35,800
inspired impressionist painters such as Sisley and the 19th century poet laureate Robert

76
00:04:35,800 --> 00:04:42,240
Bridges, who wrote in London Snow of it, stealthily and perpetually settling and loosely

77
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:43,240
lying.

78
00:04:43,240 --> 00:04:50,280
Not anymore, it seems.

79
00:04:50,280 --> 00:04:52,360
Oh cut before I throw up.

80
00:04:52,360 --> 00:04:56,760
As I said in my last video, too often the media seem to think stories about the environment

81
00:04:56,760 --> 00:05:00,860
are touchy-feely human interest pieces rather than science.

82
00:05:00,860 --> 00:05:05,120
So instead of assigning the snow-free Britain story to a science journalist, who might have

83
00:05:05,120 --> 00:05:09,440
determined that it was crap, they give it to a journalist who apparently specialises

84
00:05:09,440 --> 00:05:11,620
in human rights issues.

85
00:05:11,620 --> 00:05:16,260
And instead of citing scientific studies and peer-reviewed research papers, Onions gives

86
00:05:16,260 --> 00:05:22,400
us quotes from Hamley's Toy Store, the Fenland Indoor Speed Skating Club, a local historian,

87
00:05:22,400 --> 00:05:28,500
an anthropologist and, oh yes, a scientist, Dr David Viner of the Climatic Research Unit.

88
00:05:28,500 --> 00:05:32,760
No research was cited in support of it, including Viner's.

89
00:05:32,760 --> 00:05:35,280
Someone wrote to me saying Viner should issue a retraction.

90
00:05:35,280 --> 00:05:40,880
Yes, I'd like him to go even further, a retraction and an explanation.

91
00:05:40,880 --> 00:05:45,720
But Viner has been surprisingly silent on this ever since snowmen, sledges and snowballs

92
00:05:45,720 --> 00:05:49,160
unexpectedly appeared on his doorstep last November.

93
00:05:49,160 --> 00:05:53,600
I wrote to him through the British Council, where he now works, and got this rather lame

94
00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:58,160
reply, filtered through the British Council's Public Relations Department.

95
00:05:58,160 --> 00:06:02,400
Over the past decade, climate science has moved on considerably, and there is now more

96
00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:06,800
understanding about the impact climate change will have on weather patterns in the coming

97
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:08,120
years.

98
00:06:08,120 --> 00:06:12,920
It has indeed moved on, but not to the extent that ten years ago researchers thought snow

99
00:06:12,920 --> 00:06:17,400
would be a rarity within a few years, and within a few years they completely changed

100
00:06:17,400 --> 00:06:18,400
their minds.

101
00:06:18,400 --> 00:06:23,880
I can't find anything in the scientific literature ten years ago that supports Viner's statement,

102
00:06:23,880 --> 00:06:29,280
and his unwillingness to defend the rare snow idea by citing any can only lead to the conclusion

103
00:06:29,280 --> 00:06:31,240
that there isn't any.

104
00:06:31,240 --> 00:06:36,560
Apart from Viner, Onions refers to only one other scientist but doesn't quote him at all.

105
00:06:36,560 --> 00:06:40,720
Onions writes, David Parker at the Hadley Centre for Climate Prediction and Research

106
00:06:40,720 --> 00:06:47,200
in Berkshire says, ultimately, British children could have only virtual experience of snow.

107
00:06:47,200 --> 00:06:49,320
No time scale is given.

108
00:06:49,320 --> 00:06:52,960
Ultimately could mean 100 or 150 years from now.

109
00:06:52,960 --> 00:06:58,320
As well as an explanation from Viner, I think we also deserve an explanation from the Independent.

110
00:06:58,320 --> 00:07:03,260
If this is supposed to be science news, why was a science reporter not assigned?

111
00:07:03,260 --> 00:07:07,940
Why wasn't a single scientific paper cited in support of the story's premise?

112
00:07:07,940 --> 00:07:12,280
Why wasn't it corroborated by climatologists who were actually doing research into European

113
00:07:12,280 --> 00:07:13,660
weather patterns?

114
00:07:13,660 --> 00:07:17,920
Because the Independent's claim bears no relation to anything in the scientific literature at

115
00:07:17,920 --> 00:07:22,880
the time, and it's the scientific literature that represents our knowledge of science,

116
00:07:22,880 --> 00:07:25,040
not quotes in the popular press.

117
00:07:25,040 --> 00:07:29,080
If Onions or his editor had bothered to check, they would have found a wealth of research

118
00:07:29,080 --> 00:07:34,480
on European weather patterns, none of which predicted an end to Sledgers, snowmen, snowballs

119
00:07:34,480 --> 00:07:36,200
and the excitement of waking to finance.

120
00:07:36,200 --> 00:07:38,480
All right, all right, I've just had lunch.

121
00:07:38,480 --> 00:07:42,940
A number of papers written in the late 1990s showed that warm and cold winters in Northern

122
00:07:42,940 --> 00:07:47,360
Europe are cyclical and dependent on two atmospheric phenomena.

123
00:07:47,360 --> 00:07:51,440
One of them, the North Atlantic Oscillation, is characterised by a permanent state of high

124
00:07:51,440 --> 00:07:55,160
pressure over the Azores and low pressure over Iceland.

125
00:07:55,160 --> 00:07:59,760
If the difference is small, the NAO is said to be in a negative phase and Northern European

126
00:07:59,760 --> 00:08:01,280
winters are cold.

127
00:08:01,280 --> 00:08:06,000
If the difference in pressure increases, the NAO goes into a positive phase and winters

128
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:07,400
are warmer.

129
00:08:07,400 --> 00:08:11,560
The reason for this is that the difference in pressure drives westerly winds.

130
00:08:11,560 --> 00:08:19,120
1947 and 1963 saw particularly cold winters in Britain, just like 2009 and 2010, and all

131
00:08:19,160 --> 00:08:23,520
of them coincided with negative phases of the NAO.

132
00:08:23,520 --> 00:08:29,040
The warm winters of the 1990s were associated with positive phases at the Oscillation.

133
00:08:29,040 --> 00:08:34,640
In 1997, Hurrell and Van Loon wrote this in a paper published in Climate Change.

134
00:08:34,640 --> 00:08:38,840
Recent decadal changes in temperature and precipitation are related to pronounced changes

135
00:08:38,840 --> 00:08:44,320
over the past 20 years in the wintertime atmospheric circulation over the ocean basins of the Northern

136
00:08:44,320 --> 00:08:45,960
Hemisphere.

137
00:08:45,960 --> 00:08:50,160
So Onions' assertion that scientists were attributing warmer winters to global climate

138
00:08:50,160 --> 00:08:52,600
change was pure bunkum.

139
00:08:52,600 --> 00:08:56,520
Some scientists may have been, who knows, but climatologists who were actually doing

140
00:08:56,520 --> 00:08:59,500
the research were much more circumspect.

141
00:08:59,500 --> 00:09:05,280
The uncertainty at the time was neatly summed up in the same paper by Hurrell and Van Loon.

142
00:09:05,280 --> 00:09:09,600
Whether the observed changes are in response to greenhouse gas forcing or whether the changes

143
00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:15,360
are part of a natural decadal timescale variation is difficult to assess and is a matter of

144
00:09:15,360 --> 00:09:17,540
much debate.

145
00:09:17,540 --> 00:09:22,800
Whatever the influence of global warming, no published paper concluded that the NAO

146
00:09:22,800 --> 00:09:27,840
was dead and that cold winters would become a rarity in Britain within a few years.

147
00:09:27,840 --> 00:09:31,960
The second major influence is something called the Arctic Oscillation, which was also being

148
00:09:31,960 --> 00:09:34,720
researched in the late 1990s.

149
00:09:34,720 --> 00:09:40,000
According to Thompson and Wallace in a study published in 1998, the leading empirical orthogonal

150
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:44,040
function of the wintertime sea level pressure field is more strongly coupled to surface

151
00:09:44,040 --> 00:09:49,380
air temperature fluctuations over the Eurasian continent than the NAO.

152
00:09:49,380 --> 00:09:53,920
In plain English, this means that a fluctuating weather pattern called the Arctic Oscillation

153
00:09:53,920 --> 00:09:58,000
has even more influence than the NAO.

154
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:01,860
Researchers now believe that both are linked, working together to bring extreme warm and

155
00:10:01,860 --> 00:10:06,440
cold winters to northern Europe in cycles that run over several decades.

156
00:10:06,440 --> 00:10:11,000
As a science journalist rather than a climatologist, one of the ways I can determine the importance

157
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:16,280
and influence of these papers is to see how many times they have been cited by other researchers.

158
00:10:16,280 --> 00:10:23,360
In other words, how many other studies use the results to help further their research?

159
00:10:23,360 --> 00:10:27,320
But the papers I have quoted have each been cited around a thousand times.

160
00:10:27,320 --> 00:10:30,560
It would have been impossible for the independent to have missed them.

161
00:10:30,560 --> 00:10:34,620
Of course, other factors can interrupt or exaggerate the effects of these natural cycles

162
00:10:34,620 --> 00:10:39,200
– the warming effect of carbon dioxide, the cooling effect of the solar cycle and

163
00:10:39,200 --> 00:10:41,920
the cooling effect of particulates and aerosols.

164
00:10:41,920 --> 00:10:46,800
To that, we now have to add one more factor – the reduction in Arctic sea ice.

165
00:10:46,800 --> 00:10:51,000
A capping of sea ice tends to stop heat escaping from the ocean underneath.

166
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:55,200
A recently published paper by Petakov and Semenov found that when there is less ice

167
00:10:55,200 --> 00:11:01,020
on the Barents and Karas seas, the Arctic Ocean gives up heat and warms the troposphere.

168
00:11:01,020 --> 00:11:06,180
This forms an anticyclone, a high pressure area over the Arctic that sends cold easterly

169
00:11:06,180 --> 00:11:08,320
winds across northern Europe.

170
00:11:08,560 --> 00:11:11,920
Before critics of climate science rushed to their keyboards to tell me this is just a

171
00:11:11,920 --> 00:11:17,000
hurried and belated excuse to blame global warming for the severe winter weather, let

172
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:21,160
me point out that this paper was submitted in November 2009.

173
00:11:21,160 --> 00:11:27,200
So the research was done before the severe winter of 2009-2010 and well before the severe

174
00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:32,680
weather Europe is currently experiencing in 2010-2011.

175
00:11:32,680 --> 00:11:36,520
One of the problems is that when people outside the field of science first became aware of

176
00:11:36,520 --> 00:11:40,960
global warming in the 1990s, they assumed that from that point on everything would

177
00:11:40,960 --> 00:11:42,440
start to get warmer.

178
00:11:42,440 --> 00:11:47,560
A headline in Britain's Sun newspaper, again not the best source of science news, predicted

179
00:11:47,560 --> 00:11:49,920
Acosta del Manchester.

180
00:11:49,920 --> 00:11:54,240
When Britons experienced the warm winters of the late 1990s, they assumed this was now

181
00:11:54,240 --> 00:11:55,720
the new climate.

182
00:11:55,720 --> 00:11:58,560
And so did a lot of journalists, it seems.

183
00:11:58,560 --> 00:12:03,560
There was also an assumption that global warming meant every part of the planet would get warmer.

184
00:12:03,600 --> 00:12:08,480
But that's not the case either, which is why the scientific term is climate change.

185
00:12:08,480 --> 00:12:12,640
So to the guy who wrote this post, and the people who persistently put these posts on

186
00:12:12,640 --> 00:12:17,320
my channel, scientists haven't recently been calling it climate change at all.

187
00:12:17,320 --> 00:12:21,320
The term has been in use for over a century, which is why we have the Intergovernmental

188
00:12:21,320 --> 00:12:27,020
Panel on Climate Change and the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change.

189
00:12:27,020 --> 00:12:32,200
The term global warming was a colloquialism coined in the late 1970s that specifically

190
00:12:32,200 --> 00:12:35,560
refers to rising average global temperatures.

191
00:12:35,560 --> 00:12:39,980
Petikov and Semenov's paper shows why the two terms shouldn't be confused.

192
00:12:39,980 --> 00:12:45,200
As the planet warms up, not every regional climate and every season will experience increases

193
00:12:45,200 --> 00:12:46,720
in temperature.

194
00:12:46,720 --> 00:12:51,120
By way of illustration, here's the temperature map of Europe, showing the extreme below average

195
00:12:51,120 --> 00:12:54,040
temperatures in November 2010.

196
00:12:54,040 --> 00:12:58,820
But if we zoom out from that, we can see that the rest of the northern latitudes were experiencing

197
00:12:58,820 --> 00:13:01,120
above average temperatures.

198
00:13:01,120 --> 00:13:06,040
So throughout this video series, I used the term climate change to mean climate change,

199
00:13:06,040 --> 00:13:09,040
and global warming to mean global warming.

200
00:13:09,040 --> 00:13:13,920
If you think one term has replaced the other as part of a conspiracy to fool us, I suggest

201
00:13:13,920 --> 00:13:18,840
you find out the difference and see how they're used in the scientific literature.

202
00:13:18,840 --> 00:13:23,640
So why hasn't the climate models showed us that there would be snow in winters?

203
00:13:23,640 --> 00:13:26,840
Answer, climate models have shown us exactly that.

204
00:13:26,840 --> 00:13:30,440
Well, it's hardly surprising that people don't read the research that predicted the

205
00:13:30,440 --> 00:13:35,040
deep chill, preferring instead to read fluffy stories about children never knowing the joys

206
00:13:35,040 --> 00:13:36,520
of snow.

207
00:13:36,520 --> 00:13:39,200
One's hard, the other's easy.

208
00:13:39,200 --> 00:13:44,480
So now the no snow myth joins the other myths attributed to scientists, that they predicted

209
00:13:44,480 --> 00:13:49,120
global cooling in the 1970s and an ice age in the 1990s.

210
00:13:49,120 --> 00:13:52,280
You'll find debunks of these in my other videos.

211
00:13:52,280 --> 00:13:55,800
But the last laugh really has to go to poor old Charles Onions.

212
00:13:55,800 --> 00:14:00,240
Having given us the no more snow in winter story in The Independent ten years ago, he's

213
00:14:00,240 --> 00:14:05,920
recently been reporting for the news wire AFP on, guess what, the paralysis at Charles

214
00:14:05,920 --> 00:14:08,640
de Gaulle Airport due to heavy snow.

215
00:14:08,640 --> 00:14:13,720
It could only be more ironic if he was reporting on British kids having fun with their toboggans.

216
00:14:30,240 --> 00:14:31,240
Thank you.

217
00:14:31,240 --> 00:14:31,240
