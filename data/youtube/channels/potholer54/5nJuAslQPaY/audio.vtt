WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:03.080
Snow in Britain? In winter?

00:03.080 --> 00:07.640
The Internet, of course, is awash with theories about how and why this unprecedented event

00:07.640 --> 00:08.880
is happening.

00:08.880 --> 00:12.340
Now I hope you all know me well enough by now to know that the first thing I do when

00:12.340 --> 00:18.960
confronted with Internet hysteria is, that's right, track the information back to its source.

00:18.960 --> 00:23.140
Most Internet sites quote other Internet sites that quote other Internet sites.

00:23.140 --> 00:26.780
It's the electronic adult equivalent of schoolyard gossip.

00:26.780 --> 00:30.340
And when we follow the trail right back, we find that all these assertions come from

00:30.340 --> 00:35.260
just one source, a theoretical physicist called Gianluigi Zangari.

00:35.260 --> 00:39.780
In July, he published a paper on the website of something called the Geophysical Association

00:39.780 --> 00:41.020
of Italy.

00:41.020 --> 00:45.160
Out of the hundreds of scientific papers I've read in my professional career, this has to

00:45.160 --> 00:49.820
be one of the shortest and most amateurish outside of creationist literature.

00:49.820 --> 00:53.320
It would be laughable to even presume it was peer-reviewed.

00:53.320 --> 00:56.380
It's so brief, I can sum it up very quickly.

00:56.380 --> 01:01.260
Zangari looked at satellite images and concluded that the loop current in the Gulf Stream must

01:01.260 --> 01:02.860
have slowed down.

01:02.860 --> 01:07.340
Since observations have shown us that sea currents often speed up or slow down, is this

01:07.340 --> 01:09.300
anything unusual in the Gulf?

01:09.300 --> 01:10.540
Has it happened before?

01:10.540 --> 01:12.320
Is it part of a cycle?

01:12.320 --> 01:15.060
Zangari doesn't spend any time finding that out.

01:15.060 --> 01:19.500
He's already moved on and the rest of the paper consists of conjecture, possibilities

01:19.500 --> 01:21.900
and armchair speculation.

01:21.900 --> 01:26.500
It might be plausible, he writes, that the BP oil spill caused this slowdown and that

01:26.500 --> 01:33.180
it's reasonable to foresee instabilities which in turn may interrupt the global climate.

01:33.180 --> 01:35.300
What evidence is there for any of this?

01:35.300 --> 01:36.300
None.

01:36.300 --> 01:38.220
It's just Zangari's ponderings.

01:38.220 --> 01:43.260
But the Chinese whispers of the internet playground turn these plausibles and maybes into alarming

01:43.260 --> 01:48.220
certainties about how scientists have discovered a disruption of the global climate.

01:48.220 --> 01:52.780
There's even a YouTube guru who calls himself the Earl of Sterling, spreading this alarmist

01:52.780 --> 01:53.780
crap.

01:53.780 --> 01:58.580
I call this alarmist because this is the correct definition of the term alarmist.

01:58.580 --> 02:02.620
We're not dealing with research published in respected peer-reviewed journals, warning

02:02.620 --> 02:07.060
of earthquakes, health risks and climate change and backed by solid evidence.

02:07.060 --> 02:12.620
These are people who make up scary predictions based on exaggerations or inactive imagination.

02:12.620 --> 02:14.620
In a radio interview, the Earl said this.

02:14.620 --> 02:17.980
But then he said, have you got confirmation from NOAA?

02:17.980 --> 02:19.220
A good question.

02:19.220 --> 02:21.020
What does NOAA think of your ideas?

02:21.020 --> 02:26.340
I mean, it would be good to have some actual science-based confirmation in the way of published

02:26.340 --> 02:27.340
research.

02:27.340 --> 02:31.080
As I've said before, we don't research something as complex as the global climate, just by

02:31.080 --> 02:33.860
looking out the window to see what the weather's like.

02:33.860 --> 02:39.860
And I said, with all due respect, if you want confirmation, look outside the window.

02:39.860 --> 02:44.140
Ah, if that's the best you can come up with, we don't need to waste any more time on your

02:44.140 --> 02:45.140
theory.

02:45.140 --> 02:49.440
Let's move on to the other extreme of this so-called debate, the carefully formulated

02:49.440 --> 02:53.820
theory called, it's snowing outside so the world can't be warming.

02:53.820 --> 02:57.740
Every time winter comes around, whether it's a blizzard in New York or a snow flurry in

02:57.740 --> 03:02.780
London, you can bet that someone will say, whatever happened to global warming?

03:02.780 --> 03:06.900
I thought these so-called scientists had decreed that the UK would have no more snow and that

03:06.900 --> 03:11.860
the climate would resemble the south of France, said one post in the Daily Mail.

03:11.860 --> 03:14.700
Scientists were saying there would be no more snow in Britain.

03:14.700 --> 03:16.460
When was this piece of research published?

03:16.460 --> 03:21.620
I tried to keep up with the scientific journals but obviously I missed this one, so once again

03:21.620 --> 03:24.340
let's track this down to a source.

03:24.340 --> 03:28.580
It didn't take long to discover that this didn't come from any scientific research,

03:28.580 --> 03:33.540
but a story in Britain's independent newspaper ten years ago titled, Snowfalls are now just

03:33.540 --> 03:35.220
a thing of the past.

03:35.220 --> 03:38.180
And where did the independent get this nonsense from?

03:38.180 --> 03:42.940
Well I'll come to that in a minute, but first let's check the independent's claim.

03:42.940 --> 03:47.340
Now it's labelled environment, and it's supposed to be about weather patterns and climate,

03:47.340 --> 03:49.660
which means it's a science story.

03:49.660 --> 03:54.020
But the author was someone called Charles Onions, who, no surprise for guessing, is

03:54.020 --> 03:56.100
not a science journalist.

03:56.100 --> 04:00.020
No kidding, what I'm about to read you comes verbatim from the story.

04:00.020 --> 04:03.020
Cue teary music and a silly voiceover.

04:03.020 --> 04:10.920
Sledgers, snowmen, snowballs, and the excitement at waking to find that the stuff has settled

04:10.920 --> 04:16.580
outside are all a rapidly diminishing part of Britain's culture.

04:16.580 --> 04:21.840
A generation was growing up without experiencing one of the great joys and privileges of living

04:21.840 --> 04:26.360
in this part of the world, open air skating.

04:26.360 --> 04:30.520
The chances are certainly now stacked against the sort of heavy snowfall in cities that

04:30.520 --> 04:35.800
inspired impressionist painters such as Sisley and the 19th century poet laureate Robert

04:35.800 --> 04:42.240
Bridges, who wrote in London Snow of it, stealthily and perpetually settling and loosely

04:42.240 --> 04:43.240
lying.

04:43.240 --> 04:50.280
Not anymore, it seems.

04:50.280 --> 04:52.360
Oh cut before I throw up.

04:52.360 --> 04:56.760
As I said in my last video, too often the media seem to think stories about the environment

04:56.760 --> 05:00.860
are touchy-feely human interest pieces rather than science.

05:00.860 --> 05:05.120
So instead of assigning the snow-free Britain story to a science journalist, who might have

05:05.120 --> 05:09.440
determined that it was crap, they give it to a journalist who apparently specialises

05:09.440 --> 05:11.620
in human rights issues.

05:11.620 --> 05:16.260
And instead of citing scientific studies and peer-reviewed research papers, Onions gives

05:16.260 --> 05:22.400
us quotes from Hamley's Toy Store, the Fenland Indoor Speed Skating Club, a local historian,

05:22.400 --> 05:28.500
an anthropologist and, oh yes, a scientist, Dr David Viner of the Climatic Research Unit.

05:28.500 --> 05:32.760
No research was cited in support of it, including Viner's.

05:32.760 --> 05:35.280
Someone wrote to me saying Viner should issue a retraction.

05:35.280 --> 05:40.880
Yes, I'd like him to go even further, a retraction and an explanation.

05:40.880 --> 05:45.720
But Viner has been surprisingly silent on this ever since snowmen, sledges and snowballs

05:45.720 --> 05:49.160
unexpectedly appeared on his doorstep last November.

05:49.160 --> 05:53.600
I wrote to him through the British Council, where he now works, and got this rather lame

05:53.600 --> 05:58.160
reply, filtered through the British Council's Public Relations Department.

05:58.160 --> 06:02.400
Over the past decade, climate science has moved on considerably, and there is now more

06:02.400 --> 06:06.800
understanding about the impact climate change will have on weather patterns in the coming

06:06.800 --> 06:08.120
years.

06:08.120 --> 06:12.920
It has indeed moved on, but not to the extent that ten years ago researchers thought snow

06:12.920 --> 06:17.400
would be a rarity within a few years, and within a few years they completely changed

06:17.400 --> 06:18.400
their minds.

06:18.400 --> 06:23.880
I can't find anything in the scientific literature ten years ago that supports Viner's statement,

06:23.880 --> 06:29.280
and his unwillingness to defend the rare snow idea by citing any can only lead to the conclusion

06:29.280 --> 06:31.240
that there isn't any.

06:31.240 --> 06:36.560
Apart from Viner, Onions refers to only one other scientist but doesn't quote him at all.

06:36.560 --> 06:40.720
Onions writes, David Parker at the Hadley Centre for Climate Prediction and Research

06:40.720 --> 06:47.200
in Berkshire says, ultimately, British children could have only virtual experience of snow.

06:47.200 --> 06:49.320
No time scale is given.

06:49.320 --> 06:52.960
Ultimately could mean 100 or 150 years from now.

06:52.960 --> 06:58.320
As well as an explanation from Viner, I think we also deserve an explanation from the Independent.

06:58.320 --> 07:03.260
If this is supposed to be science news, why was a science reporter not assigned?

07:03.260 --> 07:07.940
Why wasn't a single scientific paper cited in support of the story's premise?

07:07.940 --> 07:12.280
Why wasn't it corroborated by climatologists who were actually doing research into European

07:12.280 --> 07:13.660
weather patterns?

07:13.660 --> 07:17.920
Because the Independent's claim bears no relation to anything in the scientific literature at

07:17.920 --> 07:22.880
the time, and it's the scientific literature that represents our knowledge of science,

07:22.880 --> 07:25.040
not quotes in the popular press.

07:25.040 --> 07:29.080
If Onions or his editor had bothered to check, they would have found a wealth of research

07:29.080 --> 07:34.480
on European weather patterns, none of which predicted an end to Sledgers, snowmen, snowballs

07:34.480 --> 07:36.200
and the excitement of waking to finance.

07:36.200 --> 07:38.480
All right, all right, I've just had lunch.

07:38.480 --> 07:42.940
A number of papers written in the late 1990s showed that warm and cold winters in Northern

07:42.940 --> 07:47.360
Europe are cyclical and dependent on two atmospheric phenomena.

07:47.360 --> 07:51.440
One of them, the North Atlantic Oscillation, is characterised by a permanent state of high

07:51.440 --> 07:55.160
pressure over the Azores and low pressure over Iceland.

07:55.160 --> 07:59.760
If the difference is small, the NAO is said to be in a negative phase and Northern European

07:59.760 --> 08:01.280
winters are cold.

08:01.280 --> 08:06.000
If the difference in pressure increases, the NAO goes into a positive phase and winters

08:06.000 --> 08:07.400
are warmer.

08:07.400 --> 08:11.560
The reason for this is that the difference in pressure drives westerly winds.

08:11.560 --> 08:19.120
1947 and 1963 saw particularly cold winters in Britain, just like 2009 and 2010, and all

08:19.160 --> 08:23.520
of them coincided with negative phases of the NAO.

08:23.520 --> 08:29.040
The warm winters of the 1990s were associated with positive phases at the Oscillation.

08:29.040 --> 08:34.640
In 1997, Hurrell and Van Loon wrote this in a paper published in Climate Change.

08:34.640 --> 08:38.840
Recent decadal changes in temperature and precipitation are related to pronounced changes

08:38.840 --> 08:44.320
over the past 20 years in the wintertime atmospheric circulation over the ocean basins of the Northern

08:44.320 --> 08:45.960
Hemisphere.

08:45.960 --> 08:50.160
So Onions' assertion that scientists were attributing warmer winters to global climate

08:50.160 --> 08:52.600
change was pure bunkum.

08:52.600 --> 08:56.520
Some scientists may have been, who knows, but climatologists who were actually doing

08:56.520 --> 08:59.500
the research were much more circumspect.

08:59.500 --> 09:05.280
The uncertainty at the time was neatly summed up in the same paper by Hurrell and Van Loon.

09:05.280 --> 09:09.600
Whether the observed changes are in response to greenhouse gas forcing or whether the changes

09:09.600 --> 09:15.360
are part of a natural decadal timescale variation is difficult to assess and is a matter of

09:15.360 --> 09:17.540
much debate.

09:17.540 --> 09:22.800
Whatever the influence of global warming, no published paper concluded that the NAO

09:22.800 --> 09:27.840
was dead and that cold winters would become a rarity in Britain within a few years.

09:27.840 --> 09:31.960
The second major influence is something called the Arctic Oscillation, which was also being

09:31.960 --> 09:34.720
researched in the late 1990s.

09:34.720 --> 09:40.000
According to Thompson and Wallace in a study published in 1998, the leading empirical orthogonal

09:40.000 --> 09:44.040
function of the wintertime sea level pressure field is more strongly coupled to surface

09:44.040 --> 09:49.380
air temperature fluctuations over the Eurasian continent than the NAO.

09:49.380 --> 09:53.920
In plain English, this means that a fluctuating weather pattern called the Arctic Oscillation

09:53.920 --> 09:58.000
has even more influence than the NAO.

09:58.000 --> 10:01.860
Researchers now believe that both are linked, working together to bring extreme warm and

10:01.860 --> 10:06.440
cold winters to northern Europe in cycles that run over several decades.

10:06.440 --> 10:11.000
As a science journalist rather than a climatologist, one of the ways I can determine the importance

10:11.000 --> 10:16.280
and influence of these papers is to see how many times they have been cited by other researchers.

10:16.280 --> 10:23.360
In other words, how many other studies use the results to help further their research?

10:23.360 --> 10:27.320
But the papers I have quoted have each been cited around a thousand times.

10:27.320 --> 10:30.560
It would have been impossible for the independent to have missed them.

10:30.560 --> 10:34.620
Of course, other factors can interrupt or exaggerate the effects of these natural cycles

10:34.620 --> 10:39.200
– the warming effect of carbon dioxide, the cooling effect of the solar cycle and

10:39.200 --> 10:41.920
the cooling effect of particulates and aerosols.

10:41.920 --> 10:46.800
To that, we now have to add one more factor – the reduction in Arctic sea ice.

10:46.800 --> 10:51.000
A capping of sea ice tends to stop heat escaping from the ocean underneath.

10:51.000 --> 10:55.200
A recently published paper by Petakov and Semenov found that when there is less ice

10:55.200 --> 11:01.020
on the Barents and Karas seas, the Arctic Ocean gives up heat and warms the troposphere.

11:01.020 --> 11:06.180
This forms an anticyclone, a high pressure area over the Arctic that sends cold easterly

11:06.180 --> 11:08.320
winds across northern Europe.

11:08.560 --> 11:11.920
Before critics of climate science rushed to their keyboards to tell me this is just a

11:11.920 --> 11:17.000
hurried and belated excuse to blame global warming for the severe winter weather, let

11:17.000 --> 11:21.160
me point out that this paper was submitted in November 2009.

11:21.160 --> 11:27.200
So the research was done before the severe winter of 2009-2010 and well before the severe

11:27.200 --> 11:32.680
weather Europe is currently experiencing in 2010-2011.

11:32.680 --> 11:36.520
One of the problems is that when people outside the field of science first became aware of

11:36.520 --> 11:40.960
global warming in the 1990s, they assumed that from that point on everything would

11:40.960 --> 11:42.440
start to get warmer.

11:42.440 --> 11:47.560
A headline in Britain's Sun newspaper, again not the best source of science news, predicted

11:47.560 --> 11:49.920
Acosta del Manchester.

11:49.920 --> 11:54.240
When Britons experienced the warm winters of the late 1990s, they assumed this was now

11:54.240 --> 11:55.720
the new climate.

11:55.720 --> 11:58.560
And so did a lot of journalists, it seems.

11:58.560 --> 12:03.560
There was also an assumption that global warming meant every part of the planet would get warmer.

12:03.600 --> 12:08.480
But that's not the case either, which is why the scientific term is climate change.

12:08.480 --> 12:12.640
So to the guy who wrote this post, and the people who persistently put these posts on

12:12.640 --> 12:17.320
my channel, scientists haven't recently been calling it climate change at all.

12:17.320 --> 12:21.320
The term has been in use for over a century, which is why we have the Intergovernmental

12:21.320 --> 12:27.020
Panel on Climate Change and the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change.

12:27.020 --> 12:32.200
The term global warming was a colloquialism coined in the late 1970s that specifically

12:32.200 --> 12:35.560
refers to rising average global temperatures.

12:35.560 --> 12:39.980
Petikov and Semenov's paper shows why the two terms shouldn't be confused.

12:39.980 --> 12:45.200
As the planet warms up, not every regional climate and every season will experience increases

12:45.200 --> 12:46.720
in temperature.

12:46.720 --> 12:51.120
By way of illustration, here's the temperature map of Europe, showing the extreme below average

12:51.120 --> 12:54.040
temperatures in November 2010.

12:54.040 --> 12:58.820
But if we zoom out from that, we can see that the rest of the northern latitudes were experiencing

12:58.820 --> 13:01.120
above average temperatures.

13:01.120 --> 13:06.040
So throughout this video series, I used the term climate change to mean climate change,

13:06.040 --> 13:09.040
and global warming to mean global warming.

13:09.040 --> 13:13.920
If you think one term has replaced the other as part of a conspiracy to fool us, I suggest

13:13.920 --> 13:18.840
you find out the difference and see how they're used in the scientific literature.

13:18.840 --> 13:23.640
So why hasn't the climate models showed us that there would be snow in winters?

13:23.640 --> 13:26.840
Answer, climate models have shown us exactly that.

13:26.840 --> 13:30.440
Well, it's hardly surprising that people don't read the research that predicted the

13:30.440 --> 13:35.040
deep chill, preferring instead to read fluffy stories about children never knowing the joys

13:35.040 --> 13:36.520
of snow.

13:36.520 --> 13:39.200
One's hard, the other's easy.

13:39.200 --> 13:44.480
So now the no snow myth joins the other myths attributed to scientists, that they predicted
