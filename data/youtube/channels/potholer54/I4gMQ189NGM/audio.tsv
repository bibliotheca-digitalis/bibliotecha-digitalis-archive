0	6000	Let's try a quick quiz.
6000	9200	These pictures show the aftermath of four different disasters,
9200	13080	a tornado, an earthquake, a hurricane and a flood.
13080	15160	Question is, which is which?
15160	18240	Just pause the video for a second to figure it out.
18240	20800	OK, not too hard, was it?
20800	22720	Answers will be at the end.
22720	26720	But how do we know what caused these events if we weren't there to witness them?
26720	28260	Make it up?
28260	33900	And do what you did with the photos and look at the clues that these events leave behind.
33900	38780	After all, deducing what happened in the past is a process we go through every day.
38780	43340	If we weren't there, we have to work it out by observation and deduction.
43340	48380	Each sedimentary rock on Earth, for example, tells the story of how it was formed,
48380	50220	and under what conditions.
50220	53580	Geologists can identify ancient earthquakes and floods,
53580	56760	just as you can identify recent ones.
56760	61880	For thousands of years, Europeans assumed the rocks had all been laid down in the Nersarck flood.
61880	66860	But in the 18th century, early geologists took a good look at the rocks under their feet
66860	69000	and were amazed at what they found.
69000	71280	Many of the rocks they saw were in layers
71280	74560	and made of the sort of material you'd find at the bottom of the sea.
74560	75960	OK.
75960	79400	But why were some of these sedimentary layers at odd angles,
79400	82480	or on mountain tops, or bent out of shape?
82480	86000	Why were the layers made of different materials?
86000	90400	Underneath the top sedimentary layers, the picture got even more complicated.
90400	94800	In 1788, the man called the father of geology, James Hutton,
94800	98200	saw a geological formation that seemed impossible.
98200	103520	At Siccar Point in Scotland, he found this set of almost horizontal sedimentary beds
103520	106720	sitting directly on top of an almost vertical set,
106720	109120	and this formation wasn't unique.
109120	111560	It's called an angular unconformity,
111560	116040	and geologists soon found angular unconformities all over the place.
116040	120160	By the mid 19th century, two principles had been established.
120160	123880	It was clear that sedimentary beds that were once at the bottom of the sea
123880	125840	must have been uplifted.
125840	130480	Of course, the effect of these uplifts, and their opposite number, subsidence,
130480	133360	are enhanced by the rise and fall of sea levels
133360	135960	as polar ice caps grow and melt.
135960	140080	But a rise in sea level alone doesn't explain how sedimentary rocks can be
140080	143080	folded and lifted several miles high.
143080	146400	Some unseen force was acting on them.
146400	150800	Once uplifted, the rocks are subjected to erosion by wind and water.
150800	154480	Silt, sand, and mud are washed into the rivers and out to sea,
154480	158600	where they're deposited, slowly building up the sedimentary beds that'll become
158600	160600	the rocks of the future.
160600	164440	So angular unconformities weren't that weird after all.
164440	168920	The lower beds were laid down under the sea with material eroded from the land.
168960	173040	Over time and under pressure, water percolated through the deposits,
173040	176560	precipitating minerals that cemented the grains together.
176560	179920	Then the solid beds were lifted up and deformed.
179920	183360	Now above sea level, wind and rain eroded the rocks,
183360	185640	forming a soil at the surface.
185640	190400	After a period of time, sea levels rose and covered the beds once again.
190400	192480	More sediment was laid on top.
192480	196400	Then the sea levels fell and the beds were exposed.
196400	200160	Nearly every feature they'd seen in the rocks of the past can be seen in the
200160	202480	deposits that are being laid down today,
202480	205680	showing that this was a long and continual process
205680	208240	that took millions of years.
208240	213080	So early 19th century geologists had to forget their preconceived ideas.
213080	216320	Instead, they followed the evidence.
216320	219280	But although they understood erosion and sedimentation,
219280	221680	the frequent uplifts were a puzzle.
221680	226000	By observing and analyzing the rocks of the Appalachians in the 1850s,
226000	229960	American geologists deduced that a deep trough in the ocean floor
229960	232800	had accumulated sediment over millions of years
232800	235240	and then been violently uplifted.
235240	237800	They called this trough a geosyncline,
237800	240360	and they soon found other mountain ranges in the world
240360	242760	that had been formed in the same way.
242760	245840	But they still had no clue as to what caused them.
245840	250320	Then in the 1960s, researchers made a discovery that transformed our
250320	254560	understanding of the earth and its geological history.
254560	258600	The theory of plate tectonics concludes that we live on pieces of crust
258600	263120	floating on partially melted rock as they drift around the earth's surface.
263120	266560	It's likely these crustal plates are driven by convection currents in the
266560	268280	earth's upper mantle.
268280	271080	Thicker crustal plates, made mostly of granite,
271080	272720	make up our continents.
272720	277560	The oceans mostly fill the lower and thinner crustal plates made of basalt.
277560	280160	In some places these plates are moving apart,
280160	283640	and new rocks well up from the earth's mantle to fill the gap.
283640	286840	In other places they slide alongside each other,
286840	291120	and elsewhere they collide, buckling at the crash site and throwing up huge
291120	292800	mountain chains.
292800	295000	Now the uplift could be explained,
295000	298320	and it fitted exactly with the geosyncline model.
298320	301640	The deep troughs were in fact the boundaries between oceanic and
301640	303800	continental crustal plates,
303800	307400	accumulating sediment over millions of years.
307400	311840	As the ocean closed, it brought two continents into collision.
311840	315920	Thanks to precise GPS measurements, geologists can now see the process
315920	316920	happening.
316920	321640	The continents are indeed moving at about the speed your fingernails grow.
321640	326320	As Africa and Europe collide, the Alps rise about one millimetre a year,
326320	331440	and as India and Asia collide, they force up the Himalayas five times faster.
331440	335080	Plate tectonics also showed that earthquakes are caused by buckling and
335080	335880	jarring
335880	338360	along the edges of the crustal plates.
338360	342680	So if we look at the earth today, we see processes that fit perfectly with the
342680	344920	rocks we find from the past.
344920	348960	We can see and measure uplift identical to the uplift of the past.
348960	352440	We can see how material is slowly eroded and deposited,
352440	355560	and it matches exactly the deposits of the past.
355560	359420	We can even see the same patterns and layering of the rocks today,
359420	362180	as in rocks millions of years old.
362180	365000	Sometimes the sedimentary patterns are repetitive,
365000	368680	if for example deposits are laid down in a seasonal cycle.
368680	373280	Sometimes currents are gentle, and the sediments show distinct rippling.
373280	376620	Shifting ripples in stream deposits and sand dunes
376620	379320	lead to a structure called cross-bedding.
379320	381560	And we can see the result of floods.
381560	384840	Annual floods, catastrophic floods, local floods,
384840	389580	each type of flood leaves its mark and leaves clues as to how strong it was,
389580	393520	how long it lasted, and what sort of material it carried.
393520	397240	We can see a number of different floods at different times in the past,
397240	400400	going back hundreds of millions of years.
400400	402620	And finally take a look at this place,
402620	405040	the Peak District of Derbyshire in Britain.
405040	407120	Several meters down there's coal,
407120	410560	which is the compressed remnants of a hot swampy forest.
410560	413360	Go further down, past a layer of hard grit,
413360	415120	and we find a coral reef,
415120	418320	which means that further back in time this cold moorland
418320	421200	was once a warm tropical sea.
421200	422680	The reason is simple.
422680	426480	The evidence shows that around 350 million years ago
426480	429560	the European crustal plate was much further south
429560	433600	and low-lying areas were covered by a warm coral sea.
433600	435240	Then sea levels fell,
435240	437240	the area became a river delta,
437240	440280	and the coral was buried under sand and gravel.
440280	443080	Millions of years later sea levels dropped further
443080	446360	and the delta turned into a swampy tropical forest.
446360	450600	Over the next hundred million years the European crustal plate moved slowly
450600	453080	northwards to its current position.
453080	456960	So to geologists there's no puzzle as to why we find the remnants of three
456960	460400	completely different environments in the same location.
460400	464120	It fits perfectly with what we know about crustal plate movements,
464120	467440	erosion and sedimentation.
467440	470040	Now let's go back to the quiz at the beginning.
470040	473720	Unless you recognize these pictures I can assume you weren't there when these
473720	477780	disasters happened and neither you nor I witnessed them.
477780	482500	But just like the geology all around us each of these photos has clues
482500	484700	and by using our frontal lobes,
484700	486740	the reasoning parts of our brain,
486740	489540	we can indeed work out what happened in the past.
