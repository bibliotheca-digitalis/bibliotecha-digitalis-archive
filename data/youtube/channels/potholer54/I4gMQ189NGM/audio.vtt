00:00.000 --> 00:06.000
Let's try a quick quiz.

00:06.000 --> 00:09.200
These pictures show the aftermath of four different disasters,

00:09.200 --> 00:13.080
a tornado, an earthquake, a hurricane and a flood.

00:13.080 --> 00:15.160
Question is, which is which?

00:15.160 --> 00:18.240
Just pause the video for a second to figure it out.

00:18.240 --> 00:20.800
OK, not too hard, was it?

00:20.800 --> 00:22.720
Answers will be at the end.

00:22.720 --> 00:26.720
But how do we know what caused these events if we weren't there to witness them?

00:26.720 --> 00:28.260
Make it up?

00:28.260 --> 00:33.900
And do what you did with the photos and look at the clues that these events leave behind.

00:33.900 --> 00:38.780
After all, deducing what happened in the past is a process we go through every day.

00:38.780 --> 00:43.340
If we weren't there, we have to work it out by observation and deduction.

00:43.340 --> 00:48.380
Each sedimentary rock on Earth, for example, tells the story of how it was formed,

00:48.380 --> 00:50.220
and under what conditions.

00:50.220 --> 00:53.580
Geologists can identify ancient earthquakes and floods,

00:53.580 --> 00:56.760
just as you can identify recent ones.

00:56.760 --> 01:01.880
For thousands of years, Europeans assumed the rocks had all been laid down in the Nersarck flood.

01:01.880 --> 01:06.860
But in the 18th century, early geologists took a good look at the rocks under their feet

01:06.860 --> 01:09.000
and were amazed at what they found.

01:09.000 --> 01:11.280
Many of the rocks they saw were in layers

01:11.280 --> 01:14.560
and made of the sort of material you'd find at the bottom of the sea.

01:14.560 --> 01:15.960
OK.

01:15.960 --> 01:19.400
But why were some of these sedimentary layers at odd angles,

01:19.400 --> 01:22.480
or on mountain tops, or bent out of shape?

01:22.480 --> 01:26.000
Why were the layers made of different materials?

01:26.000 --> 01:30.400
Underneath the top sedimentary layers, the picture got even more complicated.

01:30.400 --> 01:34.800
In 1788, the man called the father of geology, James Hutton,

01:34.800 --> 01:38.200
saw a geological formation that seemed impossible.

01:38.200 --> 01:43.520
At Siccar Point in Scotland, he found this set of almost horizontal sedimentary beds

01:43.520 --> 01:46.720
sitting directly on top of an almost vertical set,

01:46.720 --> 01:49.120
and this formation wasn't unique.

01:49.120 --> 01:51.560
It's called an angular unconformity,

01:51.560 --> 01:56.040
and geologists soon found angular unconformities all over the place.

01:56.040 --> 02:00.160
By the mid 19th century, two principles had been established.

02:00.160 --> 02:03.880
It was clear that sedimentary beds that were once at the bottom of the sea

02:03.880 --> 02:05.840
must have been uplifted.

02:05.840 --> 02:10.480
Of course, the effect of these uplifts, and their opposite number, subsidence,

02:10.480 --> 02:13.360
are enhanced by the rise and fall of sea levels

02:13.360 --> 02:15.960
as polar ice caps grow and melt.

02:15.960 --> 02:20.080
But a rise in sea level alone doesn't explain how sedimentary rocks can be

02:20.080 --> 02:23.080
folded and lifted several miles high.

02:23.080 --> 02:26.400
Some unseen force was acting on them.

02:26.400 --> 02:30.800
Once uplifted, the rocks are subjected to erosion by wind and water.

02:30.800 --> 02:34.480
Silt, sand, and mud are washed into the rivers and out to sea,

02:34.480 --> 02:38.600
where they're deposited, slowly building up the sedimentary beds that'll become

02:38.600 --> 02:40.600
the rocks of the future.

02:40.600 --> 02:44.440
So angular unconformities weren't that weird after all.

02:44.440 --> 02:48.920
The lower beds were laid down under the sea with material eroded from the land.

02:48.960 --> 02:53.040
Over time and under pressure, water percolated through the deposits,

02:53.040 --> 02:56.560
precipitating minerals that cemented the grains together.

02:56.560 --> 02:59.920
Then the solid beds were lifted up and deformed.

02:59.920 --> 03:03.360
Now above sea level, wind and rain eroded the rocks,

03:03.360 --> 03:05.640
forming a soil at the surface.

03:05.640 --> 03:10.400
After a period of time, sea levels rose and covered the beds once again.

03:10.400 --> 03:12.480
More sediment was laid on top.

03:12.480 --> 03:16.400
Then the sea levels fell and the beds were exposed.

03:16.400 --> 03:20.160
Nearly every feature they'd seen in the rocks of the past can be seen in the

03:20.160 --> 03:22.480
deposits that are being laid down today,

03:22.480 --> 03:25.680
showing that this was a long and continual process

03:25.680 --> 03:28.240
that took millions of years.

03:28.240 --> 03:33.080
So early 19th century geologists had to forget their preconceived ideas.

03:33.080 --> 03:36.320
Instead, they followed the evidence.

03:36.320 --> 03:39.280
But although they understood erosion and sedimentation,

03:39.280 --> 03:41.680
the frequent uplifts were a puzzle.

03:41.680 --> 03:46.000
By observing and analyzing the rocks of the Appalachians in the 1850s,

03:46.000 --> 03:49.960
American geologists deduced that a deep trough in the ocean floor

03:49.960 --> 03:52.800
had accumulated sediment over millions of years

03:52.800 --> 03:55.240
and then been violently uplifted.

03:55.240 --> 03:57.800
They called this trough a geosyncline,

03:57.800 --> 04:00.360
and they soon found other mountain ranges in the world

04:00.360 --> 04:02.760
that had been formed in the same way.

04:02.760 --> 04:05.840
But they still had no clue as to what caused them.

04:05.840 --> 04:10.320
Then in the 1960s, researchers made a discovery that transformed our

04:10.320 --> 04:14.560
understanding of the earth and its geological history.

04:14.560 --> 04:18.600
The theory of plate tectonics concludes that we live on pieces of crust

04:18.600 --> 04:23.120
floating on partially melted rock as they drift around the earth's surface.

04:23.120 --> 04:26.560
It's likely these crustal plates are driven by convection currents in the

04:26.560 --> 04:28.280
earth's upper mantle.

04:28.280 --> 04:31.080
Thicker crustal plates, made mostly of granite,

04:31.080 --> 04:32.720
make up our continents.

04:32.720 --> 04:37.560
The oceans mostly fill the lower and thinner crustal plates made of basalt.

04:37.560 --> 04:40.160
In some places these plates are moving apart,

04:40.160 --> 04:43.640
and new rocks well up from the earth's mantle to fill the gap.

04:43.640 --> 04:46.840
In other places they slide alongside each other,

04:46.840 --> 04:51.120
and elsewhere they collide, buckling at the crash site and throwing up huge

04:51.120 --> 04:52.800
mountain chains.

04:52.800 --> 04:55.000
Now the uplift could be explained,

04:55.000 --> 04:58.320
and it fitted exactly with the geosyncline model.

04:58.320 --> 05:01.640
The deep troughs were in fact the boundaries between oceanic and

05:01.640 --> 05:03.800
continental crustal plates,

05:03.800 --> 05:07.400
accumulating sediment over millions of years.

05:07.400 --> 05:11.840
As the ocean closed, it brought two continents into collision.

05:11.840 --> 05:15.920
Thanks to precise GPS measurements, geologists can now see the process

05:15.920 --> 05:16.920
happening.

05:16.920 --> 05:21.640
The continents are indeed moving at about the speed your fingernails grow.

05:21.640 --> 05:26.320
As Africa and Europe collide, the Alps rise about one millimetre a year,

05:26.320 --> 05:31.440
and as India and Asia collide, they force up the Himalayas five times faster.

05:31.440 --> 05:35.080
Plate tectonics also showed that earthquakes are caused by buckling and

05:35.080 --> 05:35.880
jarring

05:35.880 --> 05:38.360
along the edges of the crustal plates.

05:38.360 --> 05:42.680
So if we look at the earth today, we see processes that fit perfectly with the

05:42.680 --> 05:44.920
rocks we find from the past.

05:44.920 --> 05:48.960
We can see and measure uplift identical to the uplift of the past.

05:48.960 --> 05:52.440
We can see how material is slowly eroded and deposited,

05:52.440 --> 05:55.560
and it matches exactly the deposits of the past.

05:55.560 --> 05:59.420
We can even see the same patterns and layering of the rocks today,

05:59.420 --> 06:02.180
as in rocks millions of years old.

06:02.180 --> 06:05.000
Sometimes the sedimentary patterns are repetitive,

06:05.000 --> 06:08.680
if for example deposits are laid down in a seasonal cycle.

06:08.680 --> 06:13.280
Sometimes currents are gentle, and the sediments show distinct rippling.

06:13.280 --> 06:16.620
Shifting ripples in stream deposits and sand dunes

06:16.620 --> 06:19.320
lead to a structure called cross-bedding.

06:19.320 --> 06:21.560
And we can see the result of floods.

06:21.560 --> 06:24.840
Annual floods, catastrophic floods, local floods,

06:24.840 --> 06:29.580
each type of flood leaves its mark and leaves clues as to how strong it was,

06:29.580 --> 06:33.520
how long it lasted, and what sort of material it carried.

06:33.520 --> 06:37.240
We can see a number of different floods at different times in the past,

06:37.240 --> 06:40.400
going back hundreds of millions of years.

06:40.400 --> 06:42.620
And finally take a look at this place,

06:42.620 --> 06:45.040
the Peak District of Derbyshire in Britain.

06:45.040 --> 06:47.120
Several meters down there's coal,

06:47.120 --> 06:50.560
which is the compressed remnants of a hot swampy forest.

06:50.560 --> 06:53.360
Go further down, past a layer of hard grit,

06:53.360 --> 06:55.120
and we find a coral reef,

06:55.120 --> 06:58.320
which means that further back in time this cold moorland

06:58.320 --> 07:01.200
was once a warm tropical sea.

07:01.200 --> 07:02.680
The reason is simple.

07:02.680 --> 07:06.480
The evidence shows that around 350 million years ago

07:06.480 --> 07:09.560
the European crustal plate was much further south

07:09.560 --> 07:13.600
and low-lying areas were covered by a warm coral sea.

07:13.600 --> 07:15.240
Then sea levels fell,

07:15.240 --> 07:17.240
the area became a river delta,

07:17.240 --> 07:20.280
and the coral was buried under sand and gravel.

07:20.280 --> 07:23.080
Millions of years later sea levels dropped further

07:23.080 --> 07:26.360
and the delta turned into a swampy tropical forest.

07:26.360 --> 07:30.600
Over the next hundred million years the European crustal plate moved slowly

07:30.600 --> 07:33.080
northwards to its current position.

07:33.080 --> 07:36.960
So to geologists there's no puzzle as to why we find the remnants of three

07:36.960 --> 07:40.400
completely different environments in the same location.

07:40.400 --> 07:44.120
It fits perfectly with what we know about crustal plate movements,

07:44.120 --> 07:47.440
erosion and sedimentation.

07:47.440 --> 07:50.040
Now let's go back to the quiz at the beginning.

07:50.040 --> 07:53.720
Unless you recognize these pictures I can assume you weren't there when these

07:53.720 --> 07:57.780
disasters happened and neither you nor I witnessed them.

07:57.780 --> 08:02.500
But just like the geology all around us each of these photos has clues

08:02.500 --> 08:04.700
and by using our frontal lobes,

08:04.700 --> 08:06.740
the reasoning parts of our brain,

08:06.740 --> 08:09.540
we can indeed work out what happened in the past.
