1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,000
Let's try a quick quiz.

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:09,200
These pictures show the aftermath of four different disasters,

3
00:00:09,200 --> 00:00:13,080
a tornado, an earthquake, a hurricane and a flood.

4
00:00:13,080 --> 00:00:15,160
Question is, which is which?

5
00:00:15,160 --> 00:00:18,240
Just pause the video for a second to figure it out.

6
00:00:18,240 --> 00:00:20,800
OK, not too hard, was it?

7
00:00:20,800 --> 00:00:22,720
Answers will be at the end.

8
00:00:22,720 --> 00:00:26,720
But how do we know what caused these events if we weren't there to witness them?

9
00:00:26,720 --> 00:00:28,260
Make it up?

10
00:00:28,260 --> 00:00:33,900
And do what you did with the photos and look at the clues that these events leave behind.

11
00:00:33,900 --> 00:00:38,780
After all, deducing what happened in the past is a process we go through every day.

12
00:00:38,780 --> 00:00:43,340
If we weren't there, we have to work it out by observation and deduction.

13
00:00:43,340 --> 00:00:48,380
Each sedimentary rock on Earth, for example, tells the story of how it was formed,

14
00:00:48,380 --> 00:00:50,220
and under what conditions.

15
00:00:50,220 --> 00:00:53,580
Geologists can identify ancient earthquakes and floods,

16
00:00:53,580 --> 00:00:56,760
just as you can identify recent ones.

17
00:00:56,760 --> 00:01:01,880
For thousands of years, Europeans assumed the rocks had all been laid down in the Nersarck flood.

18
00:01:01,880 --> 00:01:06,860
But in the 18th century, early geologists took a good look at the rocks under their feet

19
00:01:06,860 --> 00:01:09,000
and were amazed at what they found.

20
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:11,280
Many of the rocks they saw were in layers

21
00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:14,560
and made of the sort of material you'd find at the bottom of the sea.

22
00:01:14,560 --> 00:01:15,960
OK.

23
00:01:15,960 --> 00:01:19,400
But why were some of these sedimentary layers at odd angles,

24
00:01:19,400 --> 00:01:22,480
or on mountain tops, or bent out of shape?

25
00:01:22,480 --> 00:01:26,000
Why were the layers made of different materials?

26
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:30,400
Underneath the top sedimentary layers, the picture got even more complicated.

27
00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:34,800
In 1788, the man called the father of geology, James Hutton,

28
00:01:34,800 --> 00:01:38,200
saw a geological formation that seemed impossible.

29
00:01:38,200 --> 00:01:43,520
At Siccar Point in Scotland, he found this set of almost horizontal sedimentary beds

30
00:01:43,520 --> 00:01:46,720
sitting directly on top of an almost vertical set,

31
00:01:46,720 --> 00:01:49,120
and this formation wasn't unique.

32
00:01:49,120 --> 00:01:51,560
It's called an angular unconformity,

33
00:01:51,560 --> 00:01:56,040
and geologists soon found angular unconformities all over the place.

34
00:01:56,040 --> 00:02:00,160
By the mid 19th century, two principles had been established.

35
00:02:00,160 --> 00:02:03,880
It was clear that sedimentary beds that were once at the bottom of the sea

36
00:02:03,880 --> 00:02:05,840
must have been uplifted.

37
00:02:05,840 --> 00:02:10,480
Of course, the effect of these uplifts, and their opposite number, subsidence,

38
00:02:10,480 --> 00:02:13,360
are enhanced by the rise and fall of sea levels

39
00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:15,960
as polar ice caps grow and melt.

40
00:02:15,960 --> 00:02:20,080
But a rise in sea level alone doesn't explain how sedimentary rocks can be

41
00:02:20,080 --> 00:02:23,080
folded and lifted several miles high.

42
00:02:23,080 --> 00:02:26,400
Some unseen force was acting on them.

43
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:30,800
Once uplifted, the rocks are subjected to erosion by wind and water.

44
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:34,480
Silt, sand, and mud are washed into the rivers and out to sea,

45
00:02:34,480 --> 00:02:38,600
where they're deposited, slowly building up the sedimentary beds that'll become

46
00:02:38,600 --> 00:02:40,600
the rocks of the future.

47
00:02:40,600 --> 00:02:44,440
So angular unconformities weren't that weird after all.

48
00:02:44,440 --> 00:02:48,920
The lower beds were laid down under the sea with material eroded from the land.

49
00:02:48,960 --> 00:02:53,040
Over time and under pressure, water percolated through the deposits,

50
00:02:53,040 --> 00:02:56,560
precipitating minerals that cemented the grains together.

51
00:02:56,560 --> 00:02:59,920
Then the solid beds were lifted up and deformed.

52
00:02:59,920 --> 00:03:03,360
Now above sea level, wind and rain eroded the rocks,

53
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:05,640
forming a soil at the surface.

54
00:03:05,640 --> 00:03:10,400
After a period of time, sea levels rose and covered the beds once again.

55
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:12,480
More sediment was laid on top.

56
00:03:12,480 --> 00:03:16,400
Then the sea levels fell and the beds were exposed.

57
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:20,160
Nearly every feature they'd seen in the rocks of the past can be seen in the

58
00:03:20,160 --> 00:03:22,480
deposits that are being laid down today,

59
00:03:22,480 --> 00:03:25,680
showing that this was a long and continual process

60
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:28,240
that took millions of years.

61
00:03:28,240 --> 00:03:33,080
So early 19th century geologists had to forget their preconceived ideas.

62
00:03:33,080 --> 00:03:36,320
Instead, they followed the evidence.

63
00:03:36,320 --> 00:03:39,280
But although they understood erosion and sedimentation,

64
00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:41,680
the frequent uplifts were a puzzle.

65
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:46,000
By observing and analyzing the rocks of the Appalachians in the 1850s,

66
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:49,960
American geologists deduced that a deep trough in the ocean floor

67
00:03:49,960 --> 00:03:52,800
had accumulated sediment over millions of years

68
00:03:52,800 --> 00:03:55,240
and then been violently uplifted.

69
00:03:55,240 --> 00:03:57,800
They called this trough a geosyncline,

70
00:03:57,800 --> 00:04:00,360
and they soon found other mountain ranges in the world

71
00:04:00,360 --> 00:04:02,760
that had been formed in the same way.

72
00:04:02,760 --> 00:04:05,840
But they still had no clue as to what caused them.

73
00:04:05,840 --> 00:04:10,320
Then in the 1960s, researchers made a discovery that transformed our

74
00:04:10,320 --> 00:04:14,560
understanding of the earth and its geological history.

75
00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:18,600
The theory of plate tectonics concludes that we live on pieces of crust

76
00:04:18,600 --> 00:04:23,120
floating on partially melted rock as they drift around the earth's surface.

77
00:04:23,120 --> 00:04:26,560
It's likely these crustal plates are driven by convection currents in the

78
00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:28,280
earth's upper mantle.

79
00:04:28,280 --> 00:04:31,080
Thicker crustal plates, made mostly of granite,

80
00:04:31,080 --> 00:04:32,720
make up our continents.

81
00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:37,560
The oceans mostly fill the lower and thinner crustal plates made of basalt.

82
00:04:37,560 --> 00:04:40,160
In some places these plates are moving apart,

83
00:04:40,160 --> 00:04:43,640
and new rocks well up from the earth's mantle to fill the gap.

84
00:04:43,640 --> 00:04:46,840
In other places they slide alongside each other,

85
00:04:46,840 --> 00:04:51,120
and elsewhere they collide, buckling at the crash site and throwing up huge

86
00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:52,800
mountain chains.

87
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:55,000
Now the uplift could be explained,

88
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:58,320
and it fitted exactly with the geosyncline model.

89
00:04:58,320 --> 00:05:01,640
The deep troughs were in fact the boundaries between oceanic and

90
00:05:01,640 --> 00:05:03,800
continental crustal plates,

91
00:05:03,800 --> 00:05:07,400
accumulating sediment over millions of years.

92
00:05:07,400 --> 00:05:11,840
As the ocean closed, it brought two continents into collision.

93
00:05:11,840 --> 00:05:15,920
Thanks to precise GPS measurements, geologists can now see the process

94
00:05:15,920 --> 00:05:16,920
happening.

95
00:05:16,920 --> 00:05:21,640
The continents are indeed moving at about the speed your fingernails grow.

96
00:05:21,640 --> 00:05:26,320
As Africa and Europe collide, the Alps rise about one millimetre a year,

97
00:05:26,320 --> 00:05:31,440
and as India and Asia collide, they force up the Himalayas five times faster.

98
00:05:31,440 --> 00:05:35,080
Plate tectonics also showed that earthquakes are caused by buckling and

99
00:05:35,080 --> 00:05:35,880
jarring

100
00:05:35,880 --> 00:05:38,360
along the edges of the crustal plates.

101
00:05:38,360 --> 00:05:42,680
So if we look at the earth today, we see processes that fit perfectly with the

102
00:05:42,680 --> 00:05:44,920
rocks we find from the past.

103
00:05:44,920 --> 00:05:48,960
We can see and measure uplift identical to the uplift of the past.

104
00:05:48,960 --> 00:05:52,440
We can see how material is slowly eroded and deposited,

105
00:05:52,440 --> 00:05:55,560
and it matches exactly the deposits of the past.

106
00:05:55,560 --> 00:05:59,420
We can even see the same patterns and layering of the rocks today,

107
00:05:59,420 --> 00:06:02,180
as in rocks millions of years old.

108
00:06:02,180 --> 00:06:05,000
Sometimes the sedimentary patterns are repetitive,

109
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:08,680
if for example deposits are laid down in a seasonal cycle.

110
00:06:08,680 --> 00:06:13,280
Sometimes currents are gentle, and the sediments show distinct rippling.

111
00:06:13,280 --> 00:06:16,620
Shifting ripples in stream deposits and sand dunes

112
00:06:16,620 --> 00:06:19,320
lead to a structure called cross-bedding.

113
00:06:19,320 --> 00:06:21,560
And we can see the result of floods.

114
00:06:21,560 --> 00:06:24,840
Annual floods, catastrophic floods, local floods,

115
00:06:24,840 --> 00:06:29,580
each type of flood leaves its mark and leaves clues as to how strong it was,

116
00:06:29,580 --> 00:06:33,520
how long it lasted, and what sort of material it carried.

117
00:06:33,520 --> 00:06:37,240
We can see a number of different floods at different times in the past,

118
00:06:37,240 --> 00:06:40,400
going back hundreds of millions of years.

119
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:42,620
And finally take a look at this place,

120
00:06:42,620 --> 00:06:45,040
the Peak District of Derbyshire in Britain.

121
00:06:45,040 --> 00:06:47,120
Several meters down there's coal,

122
00:06:47,120 --> 00:06:50,560
which is the compressed remnants of a hot swampy forest.

123
00:06:50,560 --> 00:06:53,360
Go further down, past a layer of hard grit,

124
00:06:53,360 --> 00:06:55,120
and we find a coral reef,

125
00:06:55,120 --> 00:06:58,320
which means that further back in time this cold moorland

126
00:06:58,320 --> 00:07:01,200
was once a warm tropical sea.

127
00:07:01,200 --> 00:07:02,680
The reason is simple.

128
00:07:02,680 --> 00:07:06,480
The evidence shows that around 350 million years ago

129
00:07:06,480 --> 00:07:09,560
the European crustal plate was much further south

130
00:07:09,560 --> 00:07:13,600
and low-lying areas were covered by a warm coral sea.

131
00:07:13,600 --> 00:07:15,240
Then sea levels fell,

132
00:07:15,240 --> 00:07:17,240
the area became a river delta,

133
00:07:17,240 --> 00:07:20,280
and the coral was buried under sand and gravel.

134
00:07:20,280 --> 00:07:23,080
Millions of years later sea levels dropped further

135
00:07:23,080 --> 00:07:26,360
and the delta turned into a swampy tropical forest.

136
00:07:26,360 --> 00:07:30,600
Over the next hundred million years the European crustal plate moved slowly

137
00:07:30,600 --> 00:07:33,080
northwards to its current position.

138
00:07:33,080 --> 00:07:36,960
So to geologists there's no puzzle as to why we find the remnants of three

139
00:07:36,960 --> 00:07:40,400
completely different environments in the same location.

140
00:07:40,400 --> 00:07:44,120
It fits perfectly with what we know about crustal plate movements,

141
00:07:44,120 --> 00:07:47,440
erosion and sedimentation.

142
00:07:47,440 --> 00:07:50,040
Now let's go back to the quiz at the beginning.

143
00:07:50,040 --> 00:07:53,720
Unless you recognize these pictures I can assume you weren't there when these

144
00:07:53,720 --> 00:07:57,780
disasters happened and neither you nor I witnessed them.

145
00:07:57,780 --> 00:08:02,500
But just like the geology all around us each of these photos has clues

146
00:08:02,500 --> 00:08:04,700
and by using our frontal lobes,

147
00:08:04,700 --> 00:08:06,740
the reasoning parts of our brain,

148
00:08:06,740 --> 00:08:09,540
we can indeed work out what happened in the past.
