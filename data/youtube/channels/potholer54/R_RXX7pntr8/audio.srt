1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,880
If the theory of evolution was viable, if I open this jar of peanut butter, maybe not

2
00:00:07,880 --> 00:00:15,880
often, but on some occasion I should find new life inside. You may smile at this.

3
00:00:15,880 --> 00:00:29,120
Oh Jesus, you're being serious. Well then let's try to clear up what the theory of

4
00:00:29,120 --> 00:00:34,180
evolution is and whether it really does predict that new species will spring out of a jar

5
00:00:34,180 --> 00:00:38,800
of peanut butter. The one thing we all know about the theory of evolution is that it was

6
00:00:38,800 --> 00:00:45,680
proposed by Charles Darwin about 150 years ago. Well, not quite. The idea that organisms

7
00:00:45,680 --> 00:00:50,680
evolve was floating around for 2,000 years before Darwin and was revived a bit before

8
00:00:50,680 --> 00:00:55,200
his time by Jean-Baptiste Lamarck. But it didn't gain much ground because there was

9
00:00:55,200 --> 00:01:00,000
no obvious mechanism by which one type of animal could change into another. Lamarck

10
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:05,120
suggested that maybe animals changed because they felt the need to change. It didn't sound

11
00:01:05,120 --> 00:01:11,760
very scientific and with no evidence to support it, the idea didn't go very far. What Darwin did

12
00:01:11,760 --> 00:01:17,200
was to show a plausible mechanism by which these changes could happen. And let's not forget poor

13
00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:22,240
old Alfred Wallace who came up with the same idea and published it jointly. The paper they

14
00:01:22,240 --> 00:01:28,360
wrote was this. Darwin had come up with what he called the principle of natural selection. These

15
00:01:28,360 --> 00:01:33,760
days we tend to call this the theory of evolution as a kind of shorthand but that's confusing

16
00:01:33,760 --> 00:01:39,720
because we also use the term theory of evolution to describe the fact that organisms evolve. I

17
00:01:39,720 --> 00:01:44,960
want to leave the physical evidence and the proof of evolution for the next video. In this video I

18
00:01:44,960 --> 00:01:50,320
just want to look at the mechanism to see whether sitting in our armchairs and not doing a bit of

19
00:01:50,440 --> 00:01:56,280
research we can predict evolution in animals purely on the basis of what we know. That animals

20
00:01:56,280 --> 00:02:02,160
replicate themselves and that the replication isn't perfect. There's always variation. Just

21
00:02:02,160 --> 00:02:07,680
taking these two known facts and nothing else what do we expect might happen if we keep copying a

22
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:14,240
hypothetical animal generation after generation in a changing environment. Let's say the hypotheticus

23
00:02:14,240 --> 00:02:19,880
lives in a tropical climate grazing happily on grass and plants. We know from our two principles

24
00:02:19,960 --> 00:02:25,600
that not every hypotheticus is the same. This one has been born with a slightly longer neck. This

25
00:02:25,600 --> 00:02:30,280
one has slightly longer legs. The third has slightly longer claws and the fourth has a

26
00:02:30,280 --> 00:02:35,440
slightly hairier body. Over time herds of hypotheticus spread across the continent.

27
00:02:35,440 --> 00:02:41,560
But the climate changes and the continent dries up. Only scrubby bushes and hardy tubers can

28
00:02:41,560 --> 00:02:46,280
survive. The hypotheticus with the slightly longer neck can obviously get to more leaves

29
00:02:46,280 --> 00:02:52,400
than its neighbours. Inevitably taller and longer necked hypothetica are better fed and fitter and

30
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:58,320
therefore reproduce more. A few generations later the drought has caused overall numbers to dwindle

31
00:02:58,320 --> 00:03:03,320
but there are more long necked animals. But natural selection doesn't suddenly stop just

32
00:03:03,320 --> 00:03:08,280
because average neck length has increased. The longest of the long necks now has an advantage

33
00:03:08,280 --> 00:03:14,160
over ordinary long necks and so the process continues. That's so easy to understand you

34
00:03:14,160 --> 00:03:18,160
have to wonder why it's so misunderstood. I'm curious is there anybody on the stage that does

35
00:03:18,160 --> 00:03:23,280
not agree in it believe in evolution? All right for the sake of Republican candidates and peanut

36
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:29,360
butter man I'll break this process into steps and we'll see where the problem lies. Surely no

37
00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:38,000
argument there. By which I mean children are like their parents and inherit their traits. For

38
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:42,720
example if it gets colder animals with hairier bodies will have a slightly better chance of

39
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:50,080
survival. Pretty obvious? Like genes for hairy bodies. Genes that don't confer these advantages

40
00:03:50,080 --> 00:03:54,920
tend not to get passed on because the animals that carry them have a lower chance of survival.

41
00:03:54,920 --> 00:04:00,760
After years of rejecting these simple steps of natural selection some creationist preachers are

42
00:04:00,760 --> 00:04:06,800
now embracing them. Well they have to as more and more animal species turned up in the fossil record

43
00:04:06,800 --> 00:04:12,040
Noah's Ark was in danger of sinking under the weight. So creationist preachers now proposed

44
00:04:12,080 --> 00:04:17,120
that Noah filled the ark with different kinds of animals and that these later evolved and branched

45
00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:23,640
out into the huge variety we see today. But while real evolution takes millions of years creationist

46
00:04:23,640 --> 00:04:29,240
evolution squeezes all these changes into a couple of thousand. Do take a look at this great video on

47
00:04:29,240 --> 00:04:36,200
super evolution. But they accept natural selection with one important caveat. Now that's an interesting

48
00:04:36,440 --> 00:04:44,800
conclusion. What physical evidence do they have to back it up? None. Oh all right. None. In lieu

49
00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:50,400
of actual evidence creationist support their contention with one single argument that evolution

50
00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:56,200
into a new species has never been observed. In mammals that's hardly surprising. You just

51
00:04:56,200 --> 00:05:03,440
wouldn't notice. After all it only took 60 years to turn this into this. But I doubt that George

52
00:05:03,480 --> 00:05:09,200
Bush noticed any day-to-day changes when he looked in the mirror. If every scientific phenomenon had

53
00:05:09,200 --> 00:05:14,040
to be directly observed then we could wave goodbye to concepts like the flow of electricity or the

54
00:05:14,040 --> 00:05:19,480
splitting of atoms or the movement of the solar system around our galaxy. None of these can be

55
00:05:19,480 --> 00:05:25,560
directly seen. They're inferred from other observations. I'll leave the evidence of speciation

56
00:05:25,560 --> 00:05:30,600
for the next video and look at this through the example of our hypotheticus. We've seen how it

57
00:05:30,600 --> 00:05:35,400
can grow taller over time in order to survive a change of climate. But there may be other ways of

58
00:05:35,400 --> 00:05:41,520
surviving. This hypotheticus for example may not be able to compete well for leaves but because of

59
00:05:41,520 --> 00:05:46,880
its longer claws it can dig more easily for tubers so it would have a better chance of survival and

60
00:05:46,880 --> 00:05:52,640
its genes would be passed on. The question is not whether the hypotheticus would change over time

61
00:05:52,640 --> 00:05:58,800
but what could possibly stop these changes from happening. Each generational change may be tiny

62
00:05:58,840 --> 00:06:04,560
but millions of years of accumulated change in a changing environment leads to two completely

63
00:06:04,560 --> 00:06:10,400
different animals. The question is whether their DNA would by then be so different that they could

64
00:06:10,400 --> 00:06:15,560
no longer breed. In the next video we'll see if there's any physical evidence to give us the answer.

65
00:06:15,560 --> 00:06:22,600
Anti-evolutionists have other objections which come up time and again. Well if you're imagining

66
00:06:22,600 --> 00:06:29,040
something like this then obviously you can't. But using our theory of natural selection and

67
00:06:29,040 --> 00:06:34,920
breaking it down into evolutionary steps it's easy to understand. Simple organisms would have

68
00:06:34,920 --> 00:06:40,920
a sensory system like the amoeba which can sense heat cold and chemicals. This could then evolve

69
00:06:40,920 --> 00:06:46,400
into a sensory system with a central processor just like in insects. Individuals with better

70
00:06:46,400 --> 00:06:51,560
organized centralized nervous systems would be able to do more things and pass on this improved

71
00:06:51,560 --> 00:06:59,000
trait. The central processor would get bigger and better. Again in stages. I won't spend time

72
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:04,000
explaining the evolution of the eye here because there are a number of good videos on YouTube that

73
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:13,120
do that job including this one. No evolution requires variation. If information is a fancy

74
00:07:13,120 --> 00:07:18,400
way of saying bigger ears, hairier bodies and longer necks then fine we know that happens.

75
00:07:18,400 --> 00:07:24,760
We can see it. If information means miraculously adding completely new parts then of course that

76
00:07:24,760 --> 00:07:30,680
doesn't happen and we know why. In the next video I'll show the evidence that animals adapt existing

77
00:07:30,680 --> 00:07:37,920
morphology for new tasks. Trying to characterize evolution as an accident doesn't change what it

78
00:07:37,920 --> 00:07:43,160
is or the evidence for it and clearly there's nothing random about natural selection itself

79
00:07:43,160 --> 00:07:49,480
because genes survive only if they're best suited to survive. Mutations are just the inevitable

80
00:07:49,480 --> 00:07:55,720
result of DNA that didn't make a perfect copy and they're very common. The result is variation

81
00:07:55,720 --> 00:08:01,000
not some science fiction army of mutant ninja turtles. In fact there's new evidence that

82
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:05,880
mutations don't play such an important role in natural selection and this might be a good time

83
00:08:05,880 --> 00:08:11,040
to look at what we've learned since Darwin. At the time Darwin and Wallace published their paper on

84
00:08:11,040 --> 00:08:16,640
natural selection Louis Pasteur was developing his pathogenic theory of medicine the idea that

85
00:08:16,640 --> 00:08:22,040
germs cause disease but it would be laughable to presume that biologists haven't learned anything

86
00:08:22,040 --> 00:08:28,320
new about pathogens since 1860. Of course our knowledge has advanced so why would our knowledge

87
00:08:28,320 --> 00:08:34,960
of evolution be any different? Biologists now know that mutations may not be the big engine of change.

88
00:08:34,960 --> 00:08:41,440
DNA can be changed by proteins which turn genes on and off a process known as cis regulation.

89
00:08:41,440 --> 00:08:48,240
Epigenetics is a huge field but it drastically changes Darwin's premise that genes are just

90
00:08:48,240 --> 00:08:53,440
passively sitting there being manipulated by environmental changes around them. Putting this

91
00:08:53,440 --> 00:08:59,400
very simply biologists have discovered that DNA can exaggerate traits that are being naturally

92
00:08:59,400 --> 00:09:05,440
selected. Instead of being the slow and steady change that Darwin envisaged evolution seems to

93
00:09:05,440 --> 00:09:11,160
happen in fits and starts. It's as if natural selection is occasionally turbocharged. Cis

94
00:09:11,160 --> 00:09:17,400
regulation and epigenetics might explain why this happens. These and many other discoveries don't

95
00:09:17,400 --> 00:09:22,520
overturn the 19th century idea of natural selection any more than modern microbiology

96
00:09:22,520 --> 00:09:28,160
overturns the discoveries of Louis Pasteur but they do show that Darwin's ideas were crude and

97
00:09:28,160 --> 00:09:34,640
incomplete. There's a lot more to the mechanism that drives evolution yet to be uncovered. Okay

98
00:09:34,640 --> 00:09:39,800
so we deduced from the comfort of our armchairs that evolution ought to happen. At least I hope

99
00:09:39,800 --> 00:09:44,880
so. Now it's time to do the research and see if these ideas are supported by physical evidence.

100
00:09:44,880 --> 00:09:46,880
Meet me in the next video.
