0	7880	If the theory of evolution was viable, if I open this jar of peanut butter, maybe not
7880	15880	often, but on some occasion I should find new life inside. You may smile at this.
15880	29120	Oh Jesus, you're being serious. Well then let's try to clear up what the theory of
29120	34180	evolution is and whether it really does predict that new species will spring out of a jar
34180	38800	of peanut butter. The one thing we all know about the theory of evolution is that it was
38800	45680	proposed by Charles Darwin about 150 years ago. Well, not quite. The idea that organisms
45680	50680	evolve was floating around for 2,000 years before Darwin and was revived a bit before
50680	55200	his time by Jean-Baptiste Lamarck. But it didn't gain much ground because there was
55200	60000	no obvious mechanism by which one type of animal could change into another. Lamarck
60000	65120	suggested that maybe animals changed because they felt the need to change. It didn't sound
65120	71760	very scientific and with no evidence to support it, the idea didn't go very far. What Darwin did
71760	77200	was to show a plausible mechanism by which these changes could happen. And let's not forget poor
77200	82240	old Alfred Wallace who came up with the same idea and published it jointly. The paper they
82240	88360	wrote was this. Darwin had come up with what he called the principle of natural selection. These
88360	93760	days we tend to call this the theory of evolution as a kind of shorthand but that's confusing
93760	99720	because we also use the term theory of evolution to describe the fact that organisms evolve. I
99720	104960	want to leave the physical evidence and the proof of evolution for the next video. In this video I
104960	110320	just want to look at the mechanism to see whether sitting in our armchairs and not doing a bit of
110440	116280	research we can predict evolution in animals purely on the basis of what we know. That animals
116280	122160	replicate themselves and that the replication isn't perfect. There's always variation. Just
122160	127680	taking these two known facts and nothing else what do we expect might happen if we keep copying a
127680	134240	hypothetical animal generation after generation in a changing environment. Let's say the hypotheticus
134240	139880	lives in a tropical climate grazing happily on grass and plants. We know from our two principles
139960	145600	that not every hypotheticus is the same. This one has been born with a slightly longer neck. This
145600	150280	one has slightly longer legs. The third has slightly longer claws and the fourth has a
150280	155440	slightly hairier body. Over time herds of hypotheticus spread across the continent.
155440	161560	But the climate changes and the continent dries up. Only scrubby bushes and hardy tubers can
161560	166280	survive. The hypotheticus with the slightly longer neck can obviously get to more leaves
166280	172400	than its neighbours. Inevitably taller and longer necked hypothetica are better fed and fitter and
172400	178320	therefore reproduce more. A few generations later the drought has caused overall numbers to dwindle
178320	183320	but there are more long necked animals. But natural selection doesn't suddenly stop just
183320	188280	because average neck length has increased. The longest of the long necks now has an advantage
188280	194160	over ordinary long necks and so the process continues. That's so easy to understand you
194160	198160	have to wonder why it's so misunderstood. I'm curious is there anybody on the stage that does
198160	203280	not agree in it believe in evolution? All right for the sake of Republican candidates and peanut
203280	209360	butter man I'll break this process into steps and we'll see where the problem lies. Surely no
209360	218000	argument there. By which I mean children are like their parents and inherit their traits. For
218000	222720	example if it gets colder animals with hairier bodies will have a slightly better chance of
222720	230080	survival. Pretty obvious? Like genes for hairy bodies. Genes that don't confer these advantages
230080	234920	tend not to get passed on because the animals that carry them have a lower chance of survival.
234920	240760	After years of rejecting these simple steps of natural selection some creationist preachers are
240760	246800	now embracing them. Well they have to as more and more animal species turned up in the fossil record
246800	252040	Noah's Ark was in danger of sinking under the weight. So creationist preachers now proposed
252080	257120	that Noah filled the ark with different kinds of animals and that these later evolved and branched
257120	263640	out into the huge variety we see today. But while real evolution takes millions of years creationist
263640	269240	evolution squeezes all these changes into a couple of thousand. Do take a look at this great video on
269240	276200	super evolution. But they accept natural selection with one important caveat. Now that's an interesting
276440	284800	conclusion. What physical evidence do they have to back it up? None. Oh all right. None. In lieu
284800	290400	of actual evidence creationist support their contention with one single argument that evolution
290400	296200	into a new species has never been observed. In mammals that's hardly surprising. You just
296200	303440	wouldn't notice. After all it only took 60 years to turn this into this. But I doubt that George
303480	309200	Bush noticed any day-to-day changes when he looked in the mirror. If every scientific phenomenon had
309200	314040	to be directly observed then we could wave goodbye to concepts like the flow of electricity or the
314040	319480	splitting of atoms or the movement of the solar system around our galaxy. None of these can be
319480	325560	directly seen. They're inferred from other observations. I'll leave the evidence of speciation
325560	330600	for the next video and look at this through the example of our hypotheticus. We've seen how it
330600	335400	can grow taller over time in order to survive a change of climate. But there may be other ways of
335400	341520	surviving. This hypotheticus for example may not be able to compete well for leaves but because of
341520	346880	its longer claws it can dig more easily for tubers so it would have a better chance of survival and
346880	352640	its genes would be passed on. The question is not whether the hypotheticus would change over time
352640	358800	but what could possibly stop these changes from happening. Each generational change may be tiny
358840	364560	but millions of years of accumulated change in a changing environment leads to two completely
364560	370400	different animals. The question is whether their DNA would by then be so different that they could
370400	375560	no longer breed. In the next video we'll see if there's any physical evidence to give us the answer.
375560	382600	Anti-evolutionists have other objections which come up time and again. Well if you're imagining
382600	389040	something like this then obviously you can't. But using our theory of natural selection and
389040	394920	breaking it down into evolutionary steps it's easy to understand. Simple organisms would have
394920	400920	a sensory system like the amoeba which can sense heat cold and chemicals. This could then evolve
400920	406400	into a sensory system with a central processor just like in insects. Individuals with better
406400	411560	organized centralized nervous systems would be able to do more things and pass on this improved
411560	419000	trait. The central processor would get bigger and better. Again in stages. I won't spend time
419000	424000	explaining the evolution of the eye here because there are a number of good videos on YouTube that
424000	433120	do that job including this one. No evolution requires variation. If information is a fancy
433120	438400	way of saying bigger ears, hairier bodies and longer necks then fine we know that happens.
438400	444760	We can see it. If information means miraculously adding completely new parts then of course that
444760	450680	doesn't happen and we know why. In the next video I'll show the evidence that animals adapt existing
450680	457920	morphology for new tasks. Trying to characterize evolution as an accident doesn't change what it
457920	463160	is or the evidence for it and clearly there's nothing random about natural selection itself
463160	469480	because genes survive only if they're best suited to survive. Mutations are just the inevitable
469480	475720	result of DNA that didn't make a perfect copy and they're very common. The result is variation
475720	481000	not some science fiction army of mutant ninja turtles. In fact there's new evidence that
481000	485880	mutations don't play such an important role in natural selection and this might be a good time
485880	491040	to look at what we've learned since Darwin. At the time Darwin and Wallace published their paper on
491040	496640	natural selection Louis Pasteur was developing his pathogenic theory of medicine the idea that
496640	502040	germs cause disease but it would be laughable to presume that biologists haven't learned anything
502040	508320	new about pathogens since 1860. Of course our knowledge has advanced so why would our knowledge
508320	514960	of evolution be any different? Biologists now know that mutations may not be the big engine of change.
514960	521440	DNA can be changed by proteins which turn genes on and off a process known as cis regulation.
521440	528240	Epigenetics is a huge field but it drastically changes Darwin's premise that genes are just
528240	533440	passively sitting there being manipulated by environmental changes around them. Putting this
533440	539400	very simply biologists have discovered that DNA can exaggerate traits that are being naturally
539400	545440	selected. Instead of being the slow and steady change that Darwin envisaged evolution seems to
545440	551160	happen in fits and starts. It's as if natural selection is occasionally turbocharged. Cis
551160	557400	regulation and epigenetics might explain why this happens. These and many other discoveries don't
557400	562520	overturn the 19th century idea of natural selection any more than modern microbiology
562520	568160	overturns the discoveries of Louis Pasteur but they do show that Darwin's ideas were crude and
568160	574640	incomplete. There's a lot more to the mechanism that drives evolution yet to be uncovered. Okay
574640	579800	so we deduced from the comfort of our armchairs that evolution ought to happen. At least I hope
579800	584880	so. Now it's time to do the research and see if these ideas are supported by physical evidence.
584880	586880	Meet me in the next video.
