If the theory of evolution was viable, if I open this jar of peanut butter, maybe not

00:07.880 --> 00:15.880
often, but on some occasion I should find new life inside. You may smile at this.

00:15.880 --> 00:29.120
Oh Jesus, you're being serious. Well then let's try to clear up what the theory of

00:29.120 --> 00:34.180
evolution is and whether it really does predict that new species will spring out of a jar

00:34.180 --> 00:38.800
of peanut butter. The one thing we all know about the theory of evolution is that it was

00:38.800 --> 00:45.680
proposed by Charles Darwin about 150 years ago. Well, not quite. The idea that organisms

00:45.680 --> 00:50.680
evolve was floating around for 2,000 years before Darwin and was revived a bit before

00:50.680 --> 00:55.200
his time by Jean-Baptiste Lamarck. But it didn't gain much ground because there was

00:55.200 --> 01:00.000
no obvious mechanism by which one type of animal could change into another. Lamarck

01:00.000 --> 01:05.120
suggested that maybe animals changed because they felt the need to change. It didn't sound

01:05.120 --> 01:11.760
very scientific and with no evidence to support it, the idea didn't go very far. What Darwin did

01:11.760 --> 01:17.200
was to show a plausible mechanism by which these changes could happen. And let's not forget poor

01:17.200 --> 01:22.240
old Alfred Wallace who came up with the same idea and published it jointly. The paper they

01:22.240 --> 01:28.360
wrote was this. Darwin had come up with what he called the principle of natural selection. These

01:28.360 --> 01:33.760
days we tend to call this the theory of evolution as a kind of shorthand but that's confusing

01:33.760 --> 01:39.720
because we also use the term theory of evolution to describe the fact that organisms evolve. I

01:39.720 --> 01:44.960
want to leave the physical evidence and the proof of evolution for the next video. In this video I

01:44.960 --> 01:50.320
just want to look at the mechanism to see whether sitting in our armchairs and not doing a bit of

01:50.440 --> 01:56.280
research we can predict evolution in animals purely on the basis of what we know. That animals

01:56.280 --> 02:02.160
replicate themselves and that the replication isn't perfect. There's always variation. Just

02:02.160 --> 02:07.680
taking these two known facts and nothing else what do we expect might happen if we keep copying a

02:07.680 --> 02:14.240
hypothetical animal generation after generation in a changing environment. Let's say the hypotheticus

02:14.240 --> 02:19.880
lives in a tropical climate grazing happily on grass and plants. We know from our two principles

02:19.960 --> 02:25.600
that not every hypotheticus is the same. This one has been born with a slightly longer neck. This

02:25.600 --> 02:30.280
one has slightly longer legs. The third has slightly longer claws and the fourth has a

02:30.280 --> 02:35.440
slightly hairier body. Over time herds of hypotheticus spread across the continent.

02:35.440 --> 02:41.560
But the climate changes and the continent dries up. Only scrubby bushes and hardy tubers can

02:41.560 --> 02:46.280
survive. The hypotheticus with the slightly longer neck can obviously get to more leaves

02:46.280 --> 02:52.400
than its neighbours. Inevitably taller and longer necked hypothetica are better fed and fitter and

02:52.400 --> 02:58.320
therefore reproduce more. A few generations later the drought has caused overall numbers to dwindle

02:58.320 --> 03:03.320
but there are more long necked animals. But natural selection doesn't suddenly stop just

03:03.320 --> 03:08.280
because average neck length has increased. The longest of the long necks now has an advantage

03:08.280 --> 03:14.160
over ordinary long necks and so the process continues. That's so easy to understand you

03:14.160 --> 03:18.160
have to wonder why it's so misunderstood. I'm curious is there anybody on the stage that does

03:18.160 --> 03:23.280
not agree in it believe in evolution? All right for the sake of Republican candidates and peanut

03:23.280 --> 03:29.360
butter man I'll break this process into steps and we'll see where the problem lies. Surely no

03:29.360 --> 03:38.000
argument there. By which I mean children are like their parents and inherit their traits. For

03:38.000 --> 03:42.720
example if it gets colder animals with hairier bodies will have a slightly better chance of

03:42.720 --> 03:50.080
survival. Pretty obvious? Like genes for hairy bodies. Genes that don't confer these advantages

03:50.080 --> 03:54.920
tend not to get passed on because the animals that carry them have a lower chance of survival.

03:54.920 --> 04:00.760
After years of rejecting these simple steps of natural selection some creationist preachers are

04:00.760 --> 04:06.800
now embracing them. Well they have to as more and more animal species turned up in the fossil record

04:06.800 --> 04:12.040
Noah's Ark was in danger of sinking under the weight. So creationist preachers now proposed

04:12.080 --> 04:17.120
that Noah filled the ark with different kinds of animals and that these later evolved and branched

04:17.120 --> 04:23.640
out into the huge variety we see today. But while real evolution takes millions of years creationist

04:23.640 --> 04:29.240
evolution squeezes all these changes into a couple of thousand. Do take a look at this great video on

04:29.240 --> 04:36.200
super evolution. But they accept natural selection with one important caveat. Now that's an interesting

04:36.440 --> 04:44.800
conclusion. What physical evidence do they have to back it up? None. Oh all right. None. In lieu

04:44.800 --> 04:50.400
of actual evidence creationist support their contention with one single argument that evolution

04:50.400 --> 04:56.200
into a new species has never been observed. In mammals that's hardly surprising. You just

04:56.200 --> 05:03.440
wouldn't notice. After all it only took 60 years to turn this into this. But I doubt that George

05:03.480 --> 05:09.200
Bush noticed any day-to-day changes when he looked in the mirror. If every scientific phenomenon had

05:09.200 --> 05:14.040
to be directly observed then we could wave goodbye to concepts like the flow of electricity or the

05:14.040 --> 05:19.480
splitting of atoms or the movement of the solar system around our galaxy. None of these can be

05:19.480 --> 05:25.560
directly seen. They're inferred from other observations. I'll leave the evidence of speciation

05:25.560 --> 05:30.600
for the next video and look at this through the example of our hypotheticus. We've seen how it

05:30.600 --> 05:35.400
can grow taller over time in order to survive a change of climate. But there may be other ways of

05:35.400 --> 05:41.520
surviving. This hypotheticus for example may not be able to compete well for leaves but because of

05:41.520 --> 05:46.880
its longer claws it can dig more easily for tubers so it would have a better chance of survival and

05:46.880 --> 05:52.640
its genes would be passed on. The question is not whether the hypotheticus would change over time

05:52.640 --> 05:58.800
but what could possibly stop these changes from happening. Each generational change may be tiny

05:58.840 --> 06:04.560
but millions of years of accumulated change in a changing environment leads to two completely

06:04.560 --> 06:10.400
different animals. The question is whether their DNA would by then be so different that they could

06:10.400 --> 06:15.560
no longer breed. In the next video we'll see if there's any physical evidence to give us the answer.

06:15.560 --> 06:22.600
Anti-evolutionists have other objections which come up time and again. Well if you're imagining

06:22.600 --> 06:29.040
something like this then obviously you can't. But using our theory of natural selection and

06:29.040 --> 06:34.920
breaking it down into evolutionary steps it's easy to understand. Simple organisms would have

06:34.920 --> 06:40.920
a sensory system like the amoeba which can sense heat cold and chemicals. This could then evolve

06:40.920 --> 06:46.400
into a sensory system with a central processor just like in insects. Individuals with better

06:46.400 --> 06:51.560
organized centralized nervous systems would be able to do more things and pass on this improved

06:51.560 --> 06:59.000
trait. The central processor would get bigger and better. Again in stages. I won't spend time

06:59.000 --> 07:04.000
explaining the evolution of the eye here because there are a number of good videos on YouTube that

07:04.000 --> 07:13.120
do that job including this one. No evolution requires variation. If information is a fancy

07:13.120 --> 07:18.400
way of saying bigger ears, hairier bodies and longer necks then fine we know that happens.

07:18.400 --> 07:24.760
We can see it. If information means miraculously adding completely new parts then of course that

07:24.760 --> 07:30.680
doesn't happen and we know why. In the next video I'll show the evidence that animals adapt existing

07:30.680 --> 07:37.920
morphology for new tasks. Trying to characterize evolution as an accident doesn't change what it

07:37.920 --> 07:43.160
is or the evidence for it and clearly there's nothing random about natural selection itself

07:43.160 --> 07:49.480
because genes survive only if they're best suited to survive. Mutations are just the inevitable

07:49.480 --> 07:55.720
result of DNA that didn't make a perfect copy and they're very common. The result is variation

07:55.720 --> 08:01.000
not some science fiction army of mutant ninja turtles. In fact there's new evidence that

08:01.000 --> 08:05.880
mutations don't play such an important role in natural selection and this might be a good time

08:05.880 --> 08:11.040
to look at what we've learned since Darwin. At the time Darwin and Wallace published their paper on

08:11.040 --> 08:16.640
natural selection Louis Pasteur was developing his pathogenic theory of medicine the idea that

08:16.640 --> 08:22.040
germs cause disease but it would be laughable to presume that biologists haven't learned anything

08:22.040 --> 08:28.320
new about pathogens since 1860. Of course our knowledge has advanced so why would our knowledge

08:28.320 --> 08:34.960
of evolution be any different? Biologists now know that mutations may not be the big engine of change.

08:34.960 --> 08:41.440
DNA can be changed by proteins which turn genes on and off a process known as cis regulation.

08:41.440 --> 08:48.240
Epigenetics is a huge field but it drastically changes Darwin's premise that genes are just

08:48.240 --> 08:53.440
passively sitting there being manipulated by environmental changes around them. Putting this

08:53.440 --> 08:59.400
very simply biologists have discovered that DNA can exaggerate traits that are being naturally

08:59.400 --> 09:05.440
selected. Instead of being the slow and steady change that Darwin envisaged evolution seems to

09:05.440 --> 09:11.160
happen in fits and starts. It's as if natural selection is occasionally turbocharged. Cis

09:11.160 --> 09:17.400
regulation and epigenetics might explain why this happens. These and many other discoveries don't

09:17.400 --> 09:22.520
overturn the 19th century idea of natural selection any more than modern microbiology

09:22.520 --> 09:28.160
overturns the discoveries of Louis Pasteur but they do show that Darwin's ideas were crude and

09:28.160 --> 09:34.640
incomplete. There's a lot more to the mechanism that drives evolution yet to be uncovered. Okay

09:34.640 --> 09:39.800
so we deduced from the comfort of our armchairs that evolution ought to happen. At least I hope

09:39.800 --> 09:44.880
so. Now it's time to do the research and see if these ideas are supported by physical evidence.

09:44.880 --> 09:46.880
Meet me in the next video.
