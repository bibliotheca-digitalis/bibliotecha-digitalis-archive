0	3520	Someone responded to my video on hurricanes, atolls and coral,
3520	7280	very politely questioning whether total submergence beneath the waves
7280	10160	is really not a major problem facing atolls.
10160	15200	He cited a news report from Al Jazeera about a small group of islands at Kuna Yala
15200	19680	off the coast of Panama, which are indeed being swamped by rising sea levels.
19680	20800	So I took a look.
20800	23040	The Kuna tribe understand struggle.
25440	28800	They survived pirates and Spanish conquistadors,
28880	31440	a US invasion and Panamanian politicians.
33840	36560	Their latest battle, global warming.
37440	41120	I'm always ready to accept that I got something wrong and corrected.
41120	44000	But first, let's see what Al Jazeera is claiming.
44000	47680	This area where I'm standing and actually within a 30 meter radius
47680	49680	used to be completely above the water.
49680	50800	Whoa, hold the tape.
51360	55440	Now, when I saw this, I realized straight away that either we're dealing with faulty memories
55440	57600	about where the sea level used to be,
57600	61600	or this sea level rise is being caused by something other than global warming.
62160	66960	If Monica Villamizar had been a science reporter, perhaps she would have questioned it too,
66960	70000	because global warming has caused an average sea level rise
70000	72640	of a few centimeters within living memory.
72640	76960	Granted, it's uneven and the Western Caribbean may be getting more than the average,
76960	81680	but surely not enough to take the coastal water from ankle level to crotch level.
81680	85440	So I looked for more information and it turned out Reuters had done a story
85440	89040	on Kuna Yala five months earlier saying pretty much the same thing.
89760	93680	That's probably where Al Jazeera got the inspiration to do its story.
93680	97600	Except Reuters blamed a lot of the inundation on the damage to the coral reef,
97600	99040	as well as global warming.
99840	104240	Now, the destruction of coral would account for storm surges and coastal erosion.
104240	109760	Sure, but not permanent sea level rise to the extent the islanders described to Al Jazeera.
109760	112160	There was just one other possibility.
112160	114000	The sea wasn't rising.
114000	117520	The entire crust on which the island sat was sinking.
118400	123040	The Caribbean is well known as an area of complex interacting tectonic blocks.
123040	126080	So I checked to see if there are any tectonic plate movements
126080	129360	that might be causing that part of Panama to subside.
129360	131200	And it couldn't be more obvious.
131200	134560	The Kuna Yala islands lie just south of a subduction zone,
134560	137600	which means the crust they sit on is being dragged downwards
137600	140400	as the Caribbean plate to the north subducts underneath.
141280	146080	So then I went in search of papers that confirm subduction under the Kuna Yala region.
146080	146960	And here it is.
147840	152960	The results indicate such large variations in both direction and rate of secular movement
152960	158320	as to rule out changes in volume of ocean water as being more than a subordinate factor.
158320	162800	The only satisfactory explanation is that the land level beneath the tide gauges
162800	166560	is rising in some places and sinking in others.
166560	169280	Their latest battle, global warming.
170080	174880	Now I don't want to be too hard on the reporter because science is clearly not her beat.
174880	178160	The fault really lies with Al Jazeera and all the other networks
178160	180880	that assume reporting on a story on the environment
180880	185760	means assigning your most poetic journalist to do a touchy-feely human interest piece
185760	188960	instead of looking at it first and foremost as a science story.
189840	192080	Before the conspiracy theorists start saying,
192400	195040	told you so, this works both ways.
195040	198400	I still remember a Paul Harvey report from 20 years ago
198400	201760	where he refused to accept the fact that sea levels were rising
201760	205280	because he said the sea level is rising in the south of England
205280	207600	but falling in the north of Scotland.
207600	209040	So it must all be bunkum.
212800	217280	It's not the sea rising and falling but a case of the land rising and falling.
217280	219200	It's known as glacial rebound.
219280	223280	There was so much ice weighing down the north of Britain 20,000 years ago
223280	228160	that when the ice melted the crust began a process of what's called isostatic uplift.
228160	232480	And it's still rising today pushing down poor old England as it does so.
232480	234560	Sounds a great cheering from the Scots.
234560	236880	But when reporters fail to understand this
236880	240080	and confuse tectonic subsidence with climate change
240080	242640	that just muddies the waters even further.
242640	245280	Because when people like me point out that they're wrong
245280	248080	there's a danger that conspiracy theorists will seize on that
248080	250400	as a claim that none of the science can be trusted.
251200	253280	But remember what you see in the media
253280	256560	is not necessarily what's in the scientific literature.
256560	260880	Most media reports I've seen do reflect the scientific literature quite well.
260880	264800	The ones that fail are the ones that don't use scientific research as a source.
265360	268240	So if you want to know if a media report can be trusted
268240	272320	listen out or read carefully to see where the information comes from.
272320	276080	It has to be research published in a respected peer-reviewed journal.
276080	279680	Not a quote from someone who doesn't do any research in that field.
279680	283200	Not common sense or something that seems obvious to the reporter.
283200	285200	Not a piece of information from the internet
285200	289440	or a clever bloke down the pub that fits into an editorial position.
289440	293200	Not the interpretation of an editor who failed high school science.
293200	294960	Not by looking out of the window
294960	299280	and assuming that daffodils in January must be the result of global warming.
299280	302080	In the next video we'll see a classic example.
