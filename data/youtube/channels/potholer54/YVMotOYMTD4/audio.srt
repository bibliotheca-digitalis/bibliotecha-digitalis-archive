1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,520
Someone responded to my video on hurricanes, atolls and coral,

2
00:00:03,520 --> 00:00:07,280
very politely questioning whether total submergence beneath the waves

3
00:00:07,280 --> 00:00:10,160
is really not a major problem facing atolls.

4
00:00:10,160 --> 00:00:15,200
He cited a news report from Al Jazeera about a small group of islands at Kuna Yala

5
00:00:15,200 --> 00:00:19,680
off the coast of Panama, which are indeed being swamped by rising sea levels.

6
00:00:19,680 --> 00:00:20,800
So I took a look.

7
00:00:20,800 --> 00:00:23,040
The Kuna tribe understand struggle.

8
00:00:25,440 --> 00:00:28,800
They survived pirates and Spanish conquistadors,

9
00:00:28,880 --> 00:00:31,440
a US invasion and Panamanian politicians.

10
00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:36,560
Their latest battle, global warming.

11
00:00:37,440 --> 00:00:41,120
I'm always ready to accept that I got something wrong and corrected.

12
00:00:41,120 --> 00:00:44,000
But first, let's see what Al Jazeera is claiming.

13
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:47,680
This area where I'm standing and actually within a 30 meter radius

14
00:00:47,680 --> 00:00:49,680
used to be completely above the water.

15
00:00:49,680 --> 00:00:50,800
Whoa, hold the tape.

16
00:00:51,360 --> 00:00:55,440
Now, when I saw this, I realized straight away that either we're dealing with faulty memories

17
00:00:55,440 --> 00:00:57,600
about where the sea level used to be,

18
00:00:57,600 --> 00:01:01,600
or this sea level rise is being caused by something other than global warming.

19
00:01:02,160 --> 00:01:06,960
If Monica Villamizar had been a science reporter, perhaps she would have questioned it too,

20
00:01:06,960 --> 00:01:10,000
because global warming has caused an average sea level rise

21
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,640
of a few centimeters within living memory.

22
00:01:12,640 --> 00:01:16,960
Granted, it's uneven and the Western Caribbean may be getting more than the average,

23
00:01:16,960 --> 00:01:21,680
but surely not enough to take the coastal water from ankle level to crotch level.

24
00:01:21,680 --> 00:01:25,440
So I looked for more information and it turned out Reuters had done a story

25
00:01:25,440 --> 00:01:29,040
on Kuna Yala five months earlier saying pretty much the same thing.

26
00:01:29,760 --> 00:01:33,680
That's probably where Al Jazeera got the inspiration to do its story.

27
00:01:33,680 --> 00:01:37,600
Except Reuters blamed a lot of the inundation on the damage to the coral reef,

28
00:01:37,600 --> 00:01:39,040
as well as global warming.

29
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:44,240
Now, the destruction of coral would account for storm surges and coastal erosion.

30
00:01:44,240 --> 00:01:49,760
Sure, but not permanent sea level rise to the extent the islanders described to Al Jazeera.

31
00:01:49,760 --> 00:01:52,160
There was just one other possibility.

32
00:01:52,160 --> 00:01:54,000
The sea wasn't rising.

33
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:57,520
The entire crust on which the island sat was sinking.

34
00:01:58,400 --> 00:02:03,040
The Caribbean is well known as an area of complex interacting tectonic blocks.

35
00:02:03,040 --> 00:02:06,080
So I checked to see if there are any tectonic plate movements

36
00:02:06,080 --> 00:02:09,360
that might be causing that part of Panama to subside.

37
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:11,200
And it couldn't be more obvious.

38
00:02:11,200 --> 00:02:14,560
The Kuna Yala islands lie just south of a subduction zone,

39
00:02:14,560 --> 00:02:17,600
which means the crust they sit on is being dragged downwards

40
00:02:17,600 --> 00:02:20,400
as the Caribbean plate to the north subducts underneath.

41
00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:26,080
So then I went in search of papers that confirm subduction under the Kuna Yala region.

42
00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:26,960
And here it is.

43
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:32,960
The results indicate such large variations in both direction and rate of secular movement

44
00:02:32,960 --> 00:02:38,320
as to rule out changes in volume of ocean water as being more than a subordinate factor.

45
00:02:38,320 --> 00:02:42,800
The only satisfactory explanation is that the land level beneath the tide gauges

46
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:46,560
is rising in some places and sinking in others.

47
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:49,280
Their latest battle, global warming.

48
00:02:50,080 --> 00:02:54,880
Now I don't want to be too hard on the reporter because science is clearly not her beat.

49
00:02:54,880 --> 00:02:58,160
The fault really lies with Al Jazeera and all the other networks

50
00:02:58,160 --> 00:03:00,880
that assume reporting on a story on the environment

51
00:03:00,880 --> 00:03:05,760
means assigning your most poetic journalist to do a touchy-feely human interest piece

52
00:03:05,760 --> 00:03:08,960
instead of looking at it first and foremost as a science story.

53
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:12,080
Before the conspiracy theorists start saying,

54
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:15,040
told you so, this works both ways.

55
00:03:15,040 --> 00:03:18,400
I still remember a Paul Harvey report from 20 years ago

56
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:21,760
where he refused to accept the fact that sea levels were rising

57
00:03:21,760 --> 00:03:25,280
because he said the sea level is rising in the south of England

58
00:03:25,280 --> 00:03:27,600
but falling in the north of Scotland.

59
00:03:27,600 --> 00:03:29,040
So it must all be bunkum.

60
00:03:32,800 --> 00:03:37,280
It's not the sea rising and falling but a case of the land rising and falling.

61
00:03:37,280 --> 00:03:39,200
It's known as glacial rebound.

62
00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:43,280
There was so much ice weighing down the north of Britain 20,000 years ago

63
00:03:43,280 --> 00:03:48,160
that when the ice melted the crust began a process of what's called isostatic uplift.

64
00:03:48,160 --> 00:03:52,480
And it's still rising today pushing down poor old England as it does so.

65
00:03:52,480 --> 00:03:54,560
Sounds a great cheering from the Scots.

66
00:03:54,560 --> 00:03:56,880
But when reporters fail to understand this

67
00:03:56,880 --> 00:04:00,080
and confuse tectonic subsidence with climate change

68
00:04:00,080 --> 00:04:02,640
that just muddies the waters even further.

69
00:04:02,640 --> 00:04:05,280
Because when people like me point out that they're wrong

70
00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:08,080
there's a danger that conspiracy theorists will seize on that

71
00:04:08,080 --> 00:04:10,400
as a claim that none of the science can be trusted.

72
00:04:11,200 --> 00:04:13,280
But remember what you see in the media

73
00:04:13,280 --> 00:04:16,560
is not necessarily what's in the scientific literature.

74
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:20,880
Most media reports I've seen do reflect the scientific literature quite well.

75
00:04:20,880 --> 00:04:24,800
The ones that fail are the ones that don't use scientific research as a source.

76
00:04:25,360 --> 00:04:28,240
So if you want to know if a media report can be trusted

77
00:04:28,240 --> 00:04:32,320
listen out or read carefully to see where the information comes from.

78
00:04:32,320 --> 00:04:36,080
It has to be research published in a respected peer-reviewed journal.

79
00:04:36,080 --> 00:04:39,680
Not a quote from someone who doesn't do any research in that field.

80
00:04:39,680 --> 00:04:43,200
Not common sense or something that seems obvious to the reporter.

81
00:04:43,200 --> 00:04:45,200
Not a piece of information from the internet

82
00:04:45,200 --> 00:04:49,440
or a clever bloke down the pub that fits into an editorial position.

83
00:04:49,440 --> 00:04:53,200
Not the interpretation of an editor who failed high school science.

84
00:04:53,200 --> 00:04:54,960
Not by looking out of the window

85
00:04:54,960 --> 00:04:59,280
and assuming that daffodils in January must be the result of global warming.

86
00:04:59,280 --> 00:05:02,080
In the next video we'll see a classic example.
