00:00.000 --> 00:03.520
Someone responded to my video on hurricanes, atolls and coral,

00:03.520 --> 00:07.280
very politely questioning whether total submergence beneath the waves

00:07.280 --> 00:10.160
is really not a major problem facing atolls.

00:10.160 --> 00:15.200
He cited a news report from Al Jazeera about a small group of islands at Kuna Yala

00:15.200 --> 00:19.680
off the coast of Panama, which are indeed being swamped by rising sea levels.

00:19.680 --> 00:20.800
So I took a look.

00:20.800 --> 00:23.040
The Kuna tribe understand struggle.

00:25.440 --> 00:28.800
They survived pirates and Spanish conquistadors,

00:28.880 --> 00:31.440
a US invasion and Panamanian politicians.

00:33.840 --> 00:36.560
Their latest battle, global warming.

00:37.440 --> 00:41.120
I'm always ready to accept that I got something wrong and corrected.

00:41.120 --> 00:44.000
But first, let's see what Al Jazeera is claiming.

00:44.000 --> 00:47.680
This area where I'm standing and actually within a 30 meter radius

00:47.680 --> 00:49.680
used to be completely above the water.

00:49.680 --> 00:50.800
Whoa, hold the tape.

00:51.360 --> 00:55.440
Now, when I saw this, I realized straight away that either we're dealing with faulty memories

00:55.440 --> 00:57.600
about where the sea level used to be,

00:57.600 --> 01:01.600
or this sea level rise is being caused by something other than global warming.

01:02.160 --> 01:06.960
If Monica Villamizar had been a science reporter, perhaps she would have questioned it too,

01:06.960 --> 01:10.000
because global warming has caused an average sea level rise

01:10.000 --> 01:12.640
of a few centimeters within living memory.

01:12.640 --> 01:16.960
Granted, it's uneven and the Western Caribbean may be getting more than the average,

01:16.960 --> 01:21.680
but surely not enough to take the coastal water from ankle level to crotch level.

01:21.680 --> 01:25.440
So I looked for more information and it turned out Reuters had done a story

01:25.440 --> 01:29.040
on Kuna Yala five months earlier saying pretty much the same thing.

01:29.760 --> 01:33.680
That's probably where Al Jazeera got the inspiration to do its story.

01:33.680 --> 01:37.600
Except Reuters blamed a lot of the inundation on the damage to the coral reef,

01:37.600 --> 01:39.040
as well as global warming.

01:39.840 --> 01:44.240
Now, the destruction of coral would account for storm surges and coastal erosion.

01:44.240 --> 01:49.760
Sure, but not permanent sea level rise to the extent the islanders described to Al Jazeera.

01:49.760 --> 01:52.160
There was just one other possibility.

01:52.160 --> 01:54.000
The sea wasn't rising.

01:54.000 --> 01:57.520
The entire crust on which the island sat was sinking.

01:58.400 --> 02:03.040
The Caribbean is well known as an area of complex interacting tectonic blocks.

02:03.040 --> 02:06.080
So I checked to see if there are any tectonic plate movements

02:06.080 --> 02:09.360
that might be causing that part of Panama to subside.

02:09.360 --> 02:11.200
And it couldn't be more obvious.

02:11.200 --> 02:14.560
The Kuna Yala islands lie just south of a subduction zone,

02:14.560 --> 02:17.600
which means the crust they sit on is being dragged downwards

02:17.600 --> 02:20.400
as the Caribbean plate to the north subducts underneath.

02:21.280 --> 02:26.080
So then I went in search of papers that confirm subduction under the Kuna Yala region.

02:26.080 --> 02:26.960
And here it is.

02:27.840 --> 02:32.960
The results indicate such large variations in both direction and rate of secular movement

02:32.960 --> 02:38.320
as to rule out changes in volume of ocean water as being more than a subordinate factor.

02:38.320 --> 02:42.800
The only satisfactory explanation is that the land level beneath the tide gauges

02:42.800 --> 02:46.560
is rising in some places and sinking in others.

02:46.560 --> 02:49.280
Their latest battle, global warming.

02:50.080 --> 02:54.880
Now I don't want to be too hard on the reporter because science is clearly not her beat.

02:54.880 --> 02:58.160
The fault really lies with Al Jazeera and all the other networks

02:58.160 --> 03:00.880
that assume reporting on a story on the environment

03:00.880 --> 03:05.760
means assigning your most poetic journalist to do a touchy-feely human interest piece

03:05.760 --> 03:08.960
instead of looking at it first and foremost as a science story.

03:09.840 --> 03:12.080
Before the conspiracy theorists start saying,

03:12.400 --> 03:15.040
told you so, this works both ways.

03:15.040 --> 03:18.400
I still remember a Paul Harvey report from 20 years ago

03:18.400 --> 03:21.760
where he refused to accept the fact that sea levels were rising

03:21.760 --> 03:25.280
because he said the sea level is rising in the south of England

03:25.280 --> 03:27.600
but falling in the north of Scotland.

03:27.600 --> 03:29.040
So it must all be bunkum.

03:32.800 --> 03:37.280
It's not the sea rising and falling but a case of the land rising and falling.

03:37.280 --> 03:39.200
It's known as glacial rebound.

03:39.280 --> 03:43.280
There was so much ice weighing down the north of Britain 20,000 years ago

03:43.280 --> 03:48.160
that when the ice melted the crust began a process of what's called isostatic uplift.

03:48.160 --> 03:52.480
And it's still rising today pushing down poor old England as it does so.

03:52.480 --> 03:54.560
Sounds a great cheering from the Scots.

03:54.560 --> 03:56.880
But when reporters fail to understand this

03:56.880 --> 04:00.080
and confuse tectonic subsidence with climate change

04:00.080 --> 04:02.640
that just muddies the waters even further.

04:02.640 --> 04:05.280
Because when people like me point out that they're wrong

04:05.280 --> 04:08.080
there's a danger that conspiracy theorists will seize on that

04:08.080 --> 04:10.400
as a claim that none of the science can be trusted.

04:11.200 --> 04:13.280
But remember what you see in the media

04:13.280 --> 04:16.560
is not necessarily what's in the scientific literature.

04:16.560 --> 04:20.880
Most media reports I've seen do reflect the scientific literature quite well.

04:20.880 --> 04:24.800
The ones that fail are the ones that don't use scientific research as a source.

04:25.360 --> 04:28.240
So if you want to know if a media report can be trusted

04:28.240 --> 04:32.320
listen out or read carefully to see where the information comes from.

04:32.320 --> 04:36.080
It has to be research published in a respected peer-reviewed journal.

04:36.080 --> 04:39.680
Not a quote from someone who doesn't do any research in that field.

04:39.680 --> 04:43.200
Not common sense or something that seems obvious to the reporter.

04:43.200 --> 04:45.200
Not a piece of information from the internet

04:45.200 --> 04:49.440
or a clever bloke down the pub that fits into an editorial position.

04:49.440 --> 04:53.200
Not the interpretation of an editor who failed high school science.

04:53.200 --> 04:54.960
Not by looking out of the window

04:54.960 --> 04:59.280
and assuming that daffodils in January must be the result of global warming.

04:59.280 --> 05:02.080
In the next video we'll see a classic example.
