1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,280
It's not often I get three posts, one after the other, all asking me to look at the same thing,

2
00:00:05,280 --> 00:00:10,400
in this case a claim by the blog No Trick Zone. If you've followed my climate change series,

3
00:00:10,400 --> 00:00:14,480
you'll know that this site is notorious for misrepresenting science,

4
00:00:14,480 --> 00:00:19,920
and the latest offering is no exception. So I'm going to do a very quick and timely response.

5
00:00:20,800 --> 00:00:26,160
The blog claimed, citing a researcher called Scafetta, that estimates for climate sensitivity

6
00:00:26,160 --> 00:00:31,440
have been tending towards zero, based on what it calls published papers.

7
00:00:31,440 --> 00:00:36,800
So I took a look at the very first one on the list. And it wasn't a published paper at all.

8
00:00:36,800 --> 00:00:42,400
It was a blog called Toutes Les Energies. And it isn't just my opinion that it's a blog,

9
00:00:42,400 --> 00:00:47,760
it even calls itself a blog. This blog is a free space for French speaking writers.

10
00:00:48,480 --> 00:00:54,000
As for the author, Franz Karl Reinhardt, he has no training or expertise in the field of climate.

11
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:58,400
He's an electrical engineer. The big clue that this is something

12
00:00:58,400 --> 00:01:04,160
more than a scientific endeavour is that Reinhardt mixes political opinion with his conclusion.

13
00:01:04,880 --> 00:01:10,800
Demands for sequestering CO2 are unjustified, and trading of CO2 certificates is an economic

14
00:01:10,800 --> 00:01:15,360
absurdity. Well, maybe that got put to the top of the list by mistake.

15
00:01:15,920 --> 00:01:19,840
Let's have a look at the second one on the list. That's a paper published in an online

16
00:01:19,840 --> 00:01:25,760
journal called GeoResJ that started four years ago, and has announced that it's folding next

17
00:01:25,760 --> 00:01:31,760
year. It's not on the master journals list, which means it's not recognised as a proper academic

18
00:01:31,760 --> 00:01:37,600
journal. Not only that, the paper itself has been criticised by leading climate scientists

19
00:01:37,600 --> 00:01:43,520
as seriously flawed and junk science. According to Gavin Schmidt, the authors missed out the

20
00:01:43,520 --> 00:01:50,480
entire period of recent warming in their models because of a 35 year error, so that 1965 became

21
00:01:50,480 --> 00:01:56,800
the year 2000. Benjamin Henley of the University of Melbourne said the paper had used only six

22
00:01:56,800 --> 00:02:02,560
paleoclimate records when there are nearly 700 to choose from. So why would a journal,

23
00:02:02,560 --> 00:02:08,800
even one that's not even recognised as a journal, want to publish junk science? Because in this day

24
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:14,240
and age anyone can start an online journal and charge people to have their work published,

25
00:02:14,240 --> 00:02:20,160
and often the editors don't much care about the content. Hence we see papers like this one titled

26
00:02:20,160 --> 00:02:25,840
Get me off your f***ing mailing list! The third paper on the list was published in the

27
00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:31,520
International Journal of Atmospheric Sciences, which sounds very formidable, but in fact it's

28
00:02:31,520 --> 00:02:37,280
just another pay-to-play journal. This one is published in Egypt, and again it's not a

29
00:02:37,280 --> 00:02:42,880
recognised journal on the master journals list. Unfortunately the rise of the internet has led

30
00:02:42,880 --> 00:02:48,320
to the creation of thousands of these online so-called journals. Some of them are reasonably

31
00:02:48,320 --> 00:02:53,360
good, others are just money-making machines for publishers. I've explained how you can tell the

32
00:02:53,360 --> 00:02:59,200
difference in my video Can we trust peer-reviewed papers. So the problem is it's now very easy to

33
00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:04,960
get pretty much anything published, which is why we all need to be careful and check the reputation

34
00:03:04,960 --> 00:03:10,320
of something that calls itself a journal. Scafetta's graph that No Tricks Zone published

35
00:03:10,320 --> 00:03:16,160
to support its claim in fact emphasises this very point. The number of studies on climate

36
00:03:16,160 --> 00:03:24,160
sensitivity between 2000 and 2010 was on average 1.3 a year. But with the rise of blogs and online

37
00:03:24,160 --> 00:03:31,200
publishing since then, that number has shot up. In just four years between 2011 and 2014,

38
00:03:31,840 --> 00:03:37,040
21 so-called papers on this subject were published. That's more than five a year.

39
00:03:37,600 --> 00:03:43,040
The fact that the top three so-called published papers were published in obscure online journals

40
00:03:43,040 --> 00:03:48,560
and a blog, and one of them has been critiqued as flawed junk science, doesn't say much for

41
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:52,080
the quality of the list or the robustness of the conclusion.
