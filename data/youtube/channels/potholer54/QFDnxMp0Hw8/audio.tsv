0	5280	It's not often I get three posts, one after the other, all asking me to look at the same thing,
5280	10400	in this case a claim by the blog No Trick Zone. If you've followed my climate change series,
10400	14480	you'll know that this site is notorious for misrepresenting science,
14480	19920	and the latest offering is no exception. So I'm going to do a very quick and timely response.
20800	26160	The blog claimed, citing a researcher called Scafetta, that estimates for climate sensitivity
26160	31440	have been tending towards zero, based on what it calls published papers.
31440	36800	So I took a look at the very first one on the list. And it wasn't a published paper at all.
36800	42400	It was a blog called Toutes Les Energies. And it isn't just my opinion that it's a blog,
42400	47760	it even calls itself a blog. This blog is a free space for French speaking writers.
48480	54000	As for the author, Franz Karl Reinhardt, he has no training or expertise in the field of climate.
54000	58400	He's an electrical engineer. The big clue that this is something
58400	64160	more than a scientific endeavour is that Reinhardt mixes political opinion with his conclusion.
64880	70800	Demands for sequestering CO2 are unjustified, and trading of CO2 certificates is an economic
70800	75360	absurdity. Well, maybe that got put to the top of the list by mistake.
75920	79840	Let's have a look at the second one on the list. That's a paper published in an online
79840	85760	journal called GeoResJ that started four years ago, and has announced that it's folding next
85760	91760	year. It's not on the master journals list, which means it's not recognised as a proper academic
91760	97600	journal. Not only that, the paper itself has been criticised by leading climate scientists
97600	103520	as seriously flawed and junk science. According to Gavin Schmidt, the authors missed out the
103520	110480	entire period of recent warming in their models because of a 35 year error, so that 1965 became
110480	116800	the year 2000. Benjamin Henley of the University of Melbourne said the paper had used only six
116800	122560	paleoclimate records when there are nearly 700 to choose from. So why would a journal,
122560	128800	even one that's not even recognised as a journal, want to publish junk science? Because in this day
128800	134240	and age anyone can start an online journal and charge people to have their work published,
134240	140160	and often the editors don't much care about the content. Hence we see papers like this one titled
140160	145840	Get me off your f***ing mailing list! The third paper on the list was published in the
145840	151520	International Journal of Atmospheric Sciences, which sounds very formidable, but in fact it's
151520	157280	just another pay-to-play journal. This one is published in Egypt, and again it's not a
157280	162880	recognised journal on the master journals list. Unfortunately the rise of the internet has led
162880	168320	to the creation of thousands of these online so-called journals. Some of them are reasonably
168320	173360	good, others are just money-making machines for publishers. I've explained how you can tell the
173360	179200	difference in my video Can we trust peer-reviewed papers. So the problem is it's now very easy to
179200	184960	get pretty much anything published, which is why we all need to be careful and check the reputation
184960	190320	of something that calls itself a journal. Scafetta's graph that No Tricks Zone published
190320	196160	to support its claim in fact emphasises this very point. The number of studies on climate
196160	204160	sensitivity between 2000 and 2010 was on average 1.3 a year. But with the rise of blogs and online
204160	211200	publishing since then, that number has shot up. In just four years between 2011 and 2014,
211840	217040	21 so-called papers on this subject were published. That's more than five a year.
217600	223040	The fact that the top three so-called published papers were published in obscure online journals
223040	228560	and a blog, and one of them has been critiqued as flawed junk science, doesn't say much for
228560	232080	the quality of the list or the robustness of the conclusion.
