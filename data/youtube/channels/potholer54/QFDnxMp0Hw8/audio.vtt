It's not often I get three posts, one after the other, all asking me to look at the same thing,

00:05.280 --> 00:10.400
in this case a claim by the blog No Trick Zone. If you've followed my climate change series,

00:10.400 --> 00:14.480
you'll know that this site is notorious for misrepresenting science,

00:14.480 --> 00:19.920
and the latest offering is no exception. So I'm going to do a very quick and timely response.

00:20.800 --> 00:26.160
The blog claimed, citing a researcher called Scafetta, that estimates for climate sensitivity

00:26.160 --> 00:31.440
have been tending towards zero, based on what it calls published papers.

00:31.440 --> 00:36.800
So I took a look at the very first one on the list. And it wasn't a published paper at all.

00:36.800 --> 00:42.400
It was a blog called Toutes Les Energies. And it isn't just my opinion that it's a blog,

00:42.400 --> 00:47.760
it even calls itself a blog. This blog is a free space for French speaking writers.

00:48.480 --> 00:54.000
As for the author, Franz Karl Reinhardt, he has no training or expertise in the field of climate.

00:54.000 --> 00:58.400
He's an electrical engineer. The big clue that this is something

00:58.400 --> 01:04.160
more than a scientific endeavour is that Reinhardt mixes political opinion with his conclusion.

01:04.880 --> 01:10.800
Demands for sequestering CO2 are unjustified, and trading of CO2 certificates is an economic

01:10.800 --> 01:15.360
absurdity. Well, maybe that got put to the top of the list by mistake.

01:15.920 --> 01:19.840
Let's have a look at the second one on the list. That's a paper published in an online

01:19.840 --> 01:25.760
journal called GeoResJ that started four years ago, and has announced that it's folding next

01:25.760 --> 01:31.760
year. It's not on the master journals list, which means it's not recognised as a proper academic

01:31.760 --> 01:37.600
journal. Not only that, the paper itself has been criticised by leading climate scientists

01:37.600 --> 01:43.520
as seriously flawed and junk science. According to Gavin Schmidt, the authors missed out the

01:43.520 --> 01:50.480
entire period of recent warming in their models because of a 35 year error, so that 1965 became

01:50.480 --> 01:56.800
the year 2000. Benjamin Henley of the University of Melbourne said the paper had used only six

01:56.800 --> 02:02.560
paleoclimate records when there are nearly 700 to choose from. So why would a journal,

02:02.560 --> 02:08.800
even one that's not even recognised as a journal, want to publish junk science? Because in this day

02:08.800 --> 02:14.240
and age anyone can start an online journal and charge people to have their work published,

02:14.240 --> 02:20.160
and often the editors don't much care about the content. Hence we see papers like this one titled

02:20.160 --> 02:25.840
Get me off your f***ing mailing list! The third paper on the list was published in the

02:25.840 --> 02:31.520
International Journal of Atmospheric Sciences, which sounds very formidable, but in fact it's

02:31.520 --> 02:37.280
just another pay-to-play journal. This one is published in Egypt, and again it's not a

02:37.280 --> 02:42.880
recognised journal on the master journals list. Unfortunately the rise of the internet has led

02:42.880 --> 02:48.320
to the creation of thousands of these online so-called journals. Some of them are reasonably

02:48.320 --> 02:53.360
good, others are just money-making machines for publishers. I've explained how you can tell the

02:53.360 --> 02:59.200
difference in my video Can we trust peer-reviewed papers. So the problem is it's now very easy to

02:59.200 --> 03:04.960
get pretty much anything published, which is why we all need to be careful and check the reputation

03:04.960 --> 03:10.320
of something that calls itself a journal. Scafetta's graph that No Tricks Zone published

03:10.320 --> 03:16.160
to support its claim in fact emphasises this very point. The number of studies on climate

03:16.160 --> 03:24.160
sensitivity between 2000 and 2010 was on average 1.3 a year. But with the rise of blogs and online

03:24.160 --> 03:31.200
publishing since then, that number has shot up. In just four years between 2011 and 2014,

03:31.840 --> 03:37.040
21 so-called papers on this subject were published. That's more than five a year.

03:37.600 --> 03:43.040
The fact that the top three so-called published papers were published in obscure online journals

03:43.040 --> 03:48.560
and a blog, and one of them has been critiqued as flawed junk science, doesn't say much for

03:48.560 --> 03:52.080
the quality of the list or the robustness of the conclusion.
