0	4800	This is just a quick video in response to a new wave of claims that the Earth is cooling
4800	10560	and that we have record ice cover in the Arctic. Which researchers are reporting this based on what
10560	16160	data and published in which peer-reviewed journal? None, of course, because the claims are coming
16160	22000	from people who don't read scientific journals. They get all the science they need from the Daily
22000	27520	Mail. For the umpteenth time in two years, the Mail is proclaiming that the world is cooling,
27520	32800	and to prove it, we have a record return of the Arctic ice cap in August 2013.
33840	39040	Well, here's an idea. Instead of believing the headlines in the Daily Mail, how about checking
39040	45680	with the people who should know, the National Snow and Ice Data Center, the NSIDC. They monitor
45680	51520	Arctic ice cover, and there's no record return of Arctic ice at all. In fact, according to them,
51520	61600	cover for August 2013 was 398,000 square miles below the 1981 to 2010 average for August,
61600	68240	and similar to the years 2008 to 2010. In addition, ice volume is going down,
68240	72640	because not only is the ice extent retreating, the ice itself is getting thinner.
72640	81840	So, where does the Daily Mail get its figures from? Ah, from David Rose, the tabloid journalist
81840	86800	who keeps churning out stories about how the world is cooling, based on the junk scientist's
86800	92400	favorite technique, projecting long-term trends from short-term cherry-pick time intervals.
93200	97440	It works like this. Nothing in weather or climate happens in a straight line,
97440	100960	because there are always dips, peaks, and wobbles in every trend.
101440	107120	So although we've had 35 years of declining Arctic ice cover, it obviously isn't going to move in a
107120	114640	straight line. There are going to be bad years, like 2007 and 2012, where ice is at record lows,
114640	120080	and that obviously means the following year, ice cover will be higher. So all you have to do is
120080	125360	wait for a record low, compare it to the year that follows, and you can create an upward trend.
126080	130160	We saw how Christopher Monckton did this based on two years worth of data.
130160	136480	By 2008, half of that missing ice had come back. By 2009, nearly all of it had come back.
136480	142160	And now David Rose is doing it based on one year's worth of data. That slight of a hand
142160	146320	should be easy for most people to understand, but for the average Daily Mail reader,
146320	152640	I'll have to make it simpler still. Now, we all agree that temperatures will rise in London
152640	157760	between January and July, and we all know that you're not going to get a continual rise in
157760	163600	temperature, with each day being successively warmer than the previous one, right? So on May
163600	170080	the 5th it might be 68 degrees, but the next day it might be 64 degrees. Now, according to the
170080	175120	David Rose theory, this would send alarm bells ringing in the tabloid press, because it's a
175120	181280	clear indication that Britain is cooling. In fact, if we plot those two points and draw a graph,
181280	187440	it clearly shows that by July, London will be well below freezing. Now, hands up all those who
187440	193520	really think that such an absurd conclusion can be reached. OK, the Daily Mail readers have all
193520	199440	put their hands up. As for the accompanying claim of a prediction that the Arctic would be
199440	207200	ice-free by 2013, it pays to read the story rather than the headline, David. The BBC was quoting one
207200	212640	researcher, Professor Wieslaw Maslowski, whose model shows much faster ice melt than other
212640	218720	models. These other teams, the BBC reports in the body of the story, have variously produced
218720	225600	dates for an open summer ocean that, broadly speaking, go out from about 2040 to 2100.
226320	231760	And there's a quote in the same BBC story from another Arctic ice expert, Professor Peter
231760	238160	Wadhams, who said, it might not be as early as 2013, but it will be soon, much earlier than
238160	244080	2040. My thinking on this is that 2030 is not an unreasonable date to be thinking of.
244720	250800	Did you miss that, David, or feel it wasn't worth reporting, just as the record low ice volume and
250800	257360	the three decades of ice cover data outside of the one year you chose weren't worth reporting either?
