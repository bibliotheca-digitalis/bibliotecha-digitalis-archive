00:00.000 --> 00:04.800
This is just a quick video in response to a new wave of claims that the Earth is cooling

00:04.800 --> 00:10.560
and that we have record ice cover in the Arctic. Which researchers are reporting this based on what

00:10.560 --> 00:16.160
data and published in which peer-reviewed journal? None, of course, because the claims are coming

00:16.160 --> 00:22.000
from people who don't read scientific journals. They get all the science they need from the Daily

00:22.000 --> 00:27.520
Mail. For the umpteenth time in two years, the Mail is proclaiming that the world is cooling,

00:27.520 --> 00:32.800
and to prove it, we have a record return of the Arctic ice cap in August 2013.

00:33.840 --> 00:39.040
Well, here's an idea. Instead of believing the headlines in the Daily Mail, how about checking

00:39.040 --> 00:45.680
with the people who should know, the National Snow and Ice Data Center, the NSIDC. They monitor

00:45.680 --> 00:51.520
Arctic ice cover, and there's no record return of Arctic ice at all. In fact, according to them,

00:51.520 --> 01:01.600
cover for August 2013 was 398,000 square miles below the 1981 to 2010 average for August,

01:01.600 --> 01:08.240
and similar to the years 2008 to 2010. In addition, ice volume is going down,

01:08.240 --> 01:12.640
because not only is the ice extent retreating, the ice itself is getting thinner.

01:12.640 --> 01:21.840
So, where does the Daily Mail get its figures from? Ah, from David Rose, the tabloid journalist

01:21.840 --> 01:26.800
who keeps churning out stories about how the world is cooling, based on the junk scientist's

01:26.800 --> 01:32.400
favorite technique, projecting long-term trends from short-term cherry-pick time intervals.

01:33.200 --> 01:37.440
It works like this. Nothing in weather or climate happens in a straight line,

01:37.440 --> 01:40.960
because there are always dips, peaks, and wobbles in every trend.

01:41.440 --> 01:47.120
So although we've had 35 years of declining Arctic ice cover, it obviously isn't going to move in a

01:47.120 --> 01:54.640
straight line. There are going to be bad years, like 2007 and 2012, where ice is at record lows,

01:54.640 --> 02:00.080
and that obviously means the following year, ice cover will be higher. So all you have to do is

02:00.080 --> 02:05.360
wait for a record low, compare it to the year that follows, and you can create an upward trend.

02:06.080 --> 02:10.160
We saw how Christopher Monckton did this based on two years worth of data.

02:10.160 --> 02:16.480
By 2008, half of that missing ice had come back. By 2009, nearly all of it had come back.

02:16.480 --> 02:22.160
And now David Rose is doing it based on one year's worth of data. That slight of a hand

02:22.160 --> 02:26.320
should be easy for most people to understand, but for the average Daily Mail reader,

02:26.320 --> 02:32.640
I'll have to make it simpler still. Now, we all agree that temperatures will rise in London

02:32.640 --> 02:37.760
between January and July, and we all know that you're not going to get a continual rise in

02:37.760 --> 02:43.600
temperature, with each day being successively warmer than the previous one, right? So on May

02:43.600 --> 02:50.080
the 5th it might be 68 degrees, but the next day it might be 64 degrees. Now, according to the

02:50.080 --> 02:55.120
David Rose theory, this would send alarm bells ringing in the tabloid press, because it's a

02:55.120 --> 03:01.280
clear indication that Britain is cooling. In fact, if we plot those two points and draw a graph,

03:01.280 --> 03:07.440
it clearly shows that by July, London will be well below freezing. Now, hands up all those who

03:07.440 --> 03:13.520
really think that such an absurd conclusion can be reached. OK, the Daily Mail readers have all

03:13.520 --> 03:19.440
put their hands up. As for the accompanying claim of a prediction that the Arctic would be

03:19.440 --> 03:27.200
ice-free by 2013, it pays to read the story rather than the headline, David. The BBC was quoting one

03:27.200 --> 03:32.640
researcher, Professor Wieslaw Maslowski, whose model shows much faster ice melt than other

03:32.640 --> 03:38.720
models. These other teams, the BBC reports in the body of the story, have variously produced

03:38.720 --> 03:45.600
dates for an open summer ocean that, broadly speaking, go out from about 2040 to 2100.

03:46.320 --> 03:51.760
And there's a quote in the same BBC story from another Arctic ice expert, Professor Peter

03:51.760 --> 03:58.160
Wadhams, who said, it might not be as early as 2013, but it will be soon, much earlier than

03:58.160 --> 04:04.080
2040. My thinking on this is that 2030 is not an unreasonable date to be thinking of.

04:04.720 --> 04:10.800
Did you miss that, David, or feel it wasn't worth reporting, just as the record low ice volume and

04:10.800 --> 04:17.360
the three decades of ice cover data outside of the one year you chose weren't worth reporting either?
