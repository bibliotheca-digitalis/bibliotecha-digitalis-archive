00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,800
This is just a quick video in response to a new wave of claims that the Earth is cooling

2
00:00:04,800 --> 00:00:10,560
and that we have record ice cover in the Arctic. Which researchers are reporting this based on what

3
00:00:10,560 --> 00:00:16,160
data and published in which peer-reviewed journal? None, of course, because the claims are coming

4
00:00:16,160 --> 00:00:22,000
from people who don't read scientific journals. They get all the science they need from the Daily

5
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:27,520
Mail. For the umpteenth time in two years, the Mail is proclaiming that the world is cooling,

6
00:00:27,520 --> 00:00:32,800
and to prove it, we have a record return of the Arctic ice cap in August 2013.

7
00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:39,040
Well, here's an idea. Instead of believing the headlines in the Daily Mail, how about checking

8
00:00:39,040 --> 00:00:45,680
with the people who should know, the National Snow and Ice Data Center, the NSIDC. They monitor

9
00:00:45,680 --> 00:00:51,520
Arctic ice cover, and there's no record return of Arctic ice at all. In fact, according to them,

10
00:00:51,520 --> 00:01:01,600
cover for August 2013 was 398,000 square miles below the 1981 to 2010 average for August,

11
00:01:01,600 --> 00:01:08,240
and similar to the years 2008 to 2010. In addition, ice volume is going down,

12
00:01:08,240 --> 00:01:12,640
because not only is the ice extent retreating, the ice itself is getting thinner.

13
00:01:12,640 --> 00:01:21,840
So, where does the Daily Mail get its figures from? Ah, from David Rose, the tabloid journalist

14
00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:26,800
who keeps churning out stories about how the world is cooling, based on the junk scientist's

15
00:01:26,800 --> 00:01:32,400
favorite technique, projecting long-term trends from short-term cherry-pick time intervals.

16
00:01:33,200 --> 00:01:37,440
It works like this. Nothing in weather or climate happens in a straight line,

17
00:01:37,440 --> 00:01:40,960
because there are always dips, peaks, and wobbles in every trend.

18
00:01:41,440 --> 00:01:47,120
So although we've had 35 years of declining Arctic ice cover, it obviously isn't going to move in a

19
00:01:47,120 --> 00:01:54,640
straight line. There are going to be bad years, like 2007 and 2012, where ice is at record lows,

20
00:01:54,640 --> 00:02:00,080
and that obviously means the following year, ice cover will be higher. So all you have to do is

21
00:02:00,080 --> 00:02:05,360
wait for a record low, compare it to the year that follows, and you can create an upward trend.

22
00:02:06,080 --> 00:02:10,160
We saw how Christopher Monckton did this based on two years worth of data.

23
00:02:10,160 --> 00:02:16,480
By 2008, half of that missing ice had come back. By 2009, nearly all of it had come back.

24
00:02:16,480 --> 00:02:22,160
And now David Rose is doing it based on one year's worth of data. That slight of a hand

25
00:02:22,160 --> 00:02:26,320
should be easy for most people to understand, but for the average Daily Mail reader,

26
00:02:26,320 --> 00:02:32,640
I'll have to make it simpler still. Now, we all agree that temperatures will rise in London

27
00:02:32,640 --> 00:02:37,760
between January and July, and we all know that you're not going to get a continual rise in

28
00:02:37,760 --> 00:02:43,600
temperature, with each day being successively warmer than the previous one, right? So on May

29
00:02:43,600 --> 00:02:50,080
the 5th it might be 68 degrees, but the next day it might be 64 degrees. Now, according to the

30
00:02:50,080 --> 00:02:55,120
David Rose theory, this would send alarm bells ringing in the tabloid press, because it's a

31
00:02:55,120 --> 00:03:01,280
clear indication that Britain is cooling. In fact, if we plot those two points and draw a graph,

32
00:03:01,280 --> 00:03:07,440
it clearly shows that by July, London will be well below freezing. Now, hands up all those who

33
00:03:07,440 --> 00:03:13,520
really think that such an absurd conclusion can be reached. OK, the Daily Mail readers have all

34
00:03:13,520 --> 00:03:19,440
put their hands up. As for the accompanying claim of a prediction that the Arctic would be

35
00:03:19,440 --> 00:03:27,200
ice-free by 2013, it pays to read the story rather than the headline, David. The BBC was quoting one

36
00:03:27,200 --> 00:03:32,640
researcher, Professor Wieslaw Maslowski, whose model shows much faster ice melt than other

37
00:03:32,640 --> 00:03:38,720
models. These other teams, the BBC reports in the body of the story, have variously produced

38
00:03:38,720 --> 00:03:45,600
dates for an open summer ocean that, broadly speaking, go out from about 2040 to 2100.

39
00:03:46,320 --> 00:03:51,760
And there's a quote in the same BBC story from another Arctic ice expert, Professor Peter

40
00:03:51,760 --> 00:03:58,160
Wadhams, who said, it might not be as early as 2013, but it will be soon, much earlier than

41
00:03:58,160 --> 00:04:04,080
2040. My thinking on this is that 2030 is not an unreasonable date to be thinking of.

42
00:04:04,720 --> 00:04:10,800
Did you miss that, David, or feel it wasn't worth reporting, just as the record low ice volume and

43
00:04:10,800 --> 00:04:17,360
the three decades of ice cover data outside of the one year you chose weren't worth reporting either?
