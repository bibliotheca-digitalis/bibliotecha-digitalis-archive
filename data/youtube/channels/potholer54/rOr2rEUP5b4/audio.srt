1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,000
This one is called the Vela Pulsar, and it's magnificent, a thousand light years away.

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:09,100
It's a highly magnetised neutron star.

3
00:00:09,100 --> 00:00:14,600
You must remember this guy, Louis Giglio, who got very excited two years ago about a

4
00:00:14,600 --> 00:00:20,000
chemical called laminin that was in the perfect shape of the cross of our Lord Jesus Christ.

5
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:25,840
It's in the perfect shape of the cross of our Lord Jesus Christ.

6
00:00:25,840 --> 00:00:30,740
Or as I pointed out, a bit like the cross, a sort of wobbly crucifix better suited to

7
00:00:30,740 --> 00:00:33,240
the crucifixion of mermaids.

8
00:00:33,240 --> 00:00:37,440
But now he's at it again, and I bet you know what Giglio's going to say.

9
00:00:37,440 --> 00:00:42,600
Here's a distant gas cloud in our galaxy that looks exactly like our Lord Jesus Christ,

10
00:00:42,600 --> 00:00:43,600
right Louis?

11
00:00:43,600 --> 00:00:50,420
And as it is oscillating you can see what's happening, it's shooting a radio frequency

12
00:00:50,420 --> 00:00:51,680
out of itself.

13
00:00:51,680 --> 00:00:56,520
Oh, okay, maybe it's not supposed to be a galactic portrait of our Lord Jesus Christ.

14
00:00:56,520 --> 00:00:58,800
Um, I give up.

15
00:00:58,800 --> 00:01:03,560
Because when they aimed the radio telescopes at the Vela Pulsar, this is what they heard.

16
00:01:03,560 --> 00:01:08,440
Oh, I know, I know, the Vela Pulsar is going to sound like a choir of angels.

17
00:01:08,440 --> 00:01:09,440
L'OCCOLIA!

18
00:01:09,440 --> 00:01:10,440
L'OCCOLIA!

19
00:01:10,440 --> 00:01:11,440
L'OCCOLIA!

20
00:01:11,440 --> 00:01:12,440
L'OCCOLIA!

21
00:01:12,440 --> 00:01:13,440
L'OCCOLIA!

22
00:01:13,440 --> 00:01:14,440
L'OCCOLIA!

23
00:01:14,440 --> 00:01:15,440
L'OCCOLIA!

24
00:01:15,440 --> 00:01:16,440
Right Louis?

25
00:01:16,440 --> 00:01:17,440
Sounds like that, doesn't it Louis?

26
00:01:17,440 --> 00:01:20,920
This is what from a thousand light years away the Vela Pulsar sounds like right now.

27
00:01:21,160 --> 00:01:22,160
This is it, listen to this.

28
00:01:22,160 --> 00:01:40,000
Now I don't know about you but that blew me away, I'm thinking wow, this is incredible.

29
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:41,040
You're like well what does it mean?

30
00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:44,960
I don't know, is that some kind of Morse code for something or what does all that mean?

31
00:01:44,960 --> 00:01:50,040
I don't know what it means but I don't want to go too crazy here but maybe the Vela Pulsar

32
00:01:50,160 --> 00:01:55,400
got wind somehow innately of Psalm 148 verse 3 and says praise him sun and moon and all

33
00:01:55,400 --> 00:01:58,520
you shining stars, we're a shining star, we should praise him.

34
00:01:58,520 --> 00:01:59,520
Well how are we going to praise him?

35
00:01:59,520 --> 00:02:05,400
I know, let's oscillate 11 times a second on our axis and see if we can send a radio

36
00:02:05,400 --> 00:02:13,920
signal into the universe that would join in the symphony of God's praise from all creation.

37
00:02:13,920 --> 00:02:18,720
Yeah, yep, that's exactly what happened Louis.

38
00:02:18,720 --> 00:02:23,120
A neutron star was just sitting there with nothing to do after the star it came from

39
00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:28,840
exploded and collapsed and it thought, because it has a brain after all, it thought, according

40
00:02:28,840 --> 00:02:34,820
to a psalm I heard on a distant planet, I'm supposed to be singing praises to some deity.

41
00:02:34,820 --> 00:02:36,340
With me so far?

42
00:02:36,340 --> 00:02:40,640
Now although this neutron star had a brain and was very smart, it didn't have lungs

43
00:02:40,640 --> 00:02:46,440
or a larynx or a mouth, come on that would be silly, so through sheer willpower it made

44
00:02:46,440 --> 00:02:52,560
itself start spinning, just like a mountain can't, because it knew that by spinning 11

45
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:58,100
times a second it would eject x-rays and gamma rays that would make beautiful music, or at

46
00:02:58,100 --> 00:03:00,000
least the sound of a jackhammer.

47
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,120
I don't want to go too crazy here.

48
00:03:02,120 --> 00:03:06,700
No, of course not Louis, I'm glad you've kept this real and haven't ventured into the world

49
00:03:06,700 --> 00:03:08,760
of lunatic fantasy.

50
00:03:08,760 --> 00:03:13,280
And it's fascinating to learn that choirs like this one are wasting their time because

51
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:19,040
lovely as these melodic harmonies sound to our ears, God would be just as happy with

52
00:03:19,040 --> 00:03:20,040
this.

53
00:03:20,040 --> 00:03:32,920
However, there are a few things that make this intelligent pulsar idea kind of implausible

54
00:03:32,920 --> 00:03:34,080
anyway.

55
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:42,360
When I say a few, I actually mean about 3520, but I'll save us both time and give you one.

56
00:03:42,360 --> 00:03:47,180
The first thing that defeats this idea that a pulsar is singing from a hymn sheet is the

57
00:03:47,180 --> 00:03:49,120
first law of the movie Alien.

58
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:54,000
In space, no one can hear you scream.

59
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:57,680
That's not just a clever tagline, it's a fact of physics.

60
00:03:57,680 --> 00:04:02,180
Sound needs a medium in which to propagate, because sound waves are compression waves,

61
00:04:02,180 --> 00:04:04,700
they have to compress something.

62
00:04:04,700 --> 00:04:09,680
So for example here's the Mormon Tabernacle Choir singing How Great Thou Art at normal

63
00:04:09,680 --> 00:04:11,520
atmospheric pressure.

64
00:04:11,520 --> 00:04:15,640
Now we've sealed the temple around them to make it airtight, so watch what happens as

65
00:04:15,640 --> 00:04:31,640
we suck the air out and replicate the vacuum of space.

66
00:04:31,640 --> 00:04:36,400
And no, the choir would not explode as they do in sci-fi movies, but just before they

67
00:04:36,400 --> 00:04:41,840
pass out and die of asphyxiation, notice how their singing becomes inaudible as less air

68
00:04:41,840 --> 00:04:45,040
becomes available to propagate the sound waves.

69
00:04:45,040 --> 00:04:50,360
So this pulsar isn't singing the praises of our Lord, even if you went right up to it,

70
00:04:50,360 --> 00:04:55,960
all you'd hear is this.

71
00:04:55,960 --> 00:05:00,080
What you're playing to your impressionable audience, Louis, are just computer-generated

72
00:05:00,080 --> 00:05:04,720
sound waves following the pattern of electromagnetic emissions.

73
00:05:04,960 --> 00:05:08,560
And just one other thing I guess I ought to comment on, I didn't realise that not only

74
00:05:08,560 --> 00:05:13,340
do stars have a brain, but they can exercise free will as well.

75
00:05:13,340 --> 00:05:17,760
They can decide whether to praise God or not praise God, and I guess that means they can

76
00:05:17,760 --> 00:05:22,380
decide whether they want to be religious, maybe there are atheist stars.

77
00:05:22,380 --> 00:05:27,000
And if they don't have free will, because according to the Bible only humans have that,

78
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:32,760
then the only alternative is that God deliberately designed these neutron stars to eject charged

79
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:35,580
particles and sing his praises.

80
00:05:35,580 --> 00:05:40,000
If so, what an egotistical, self-deluding deity he is.

81
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:44,360
He's a bit like a teenage girl singing in front of a mirror, who plays her own fake

82
00:05:44,360 --> 00:05:48,160
tape of audience applause every time she finishes a performance.

83
00:05:48,160 --> 00:05:51,600
Louis, doesn't your God have better things to do with his time?
