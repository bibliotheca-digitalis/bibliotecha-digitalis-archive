00:00.000 --> 00:06.000
This one is called the Vela Pulsar, and it's magnificent, a thousand light years away.

00:06.000 --> 00:09.100
It's a highly magnetised neutron star.

00:09.100 --> 00:14.600
You must remember this guy, Louis Giglio, who got very excited two years ago about a

00:14.600 --> 00:20.000
chemical called laminin that was in the perfect shape of the cross of our Lord Jesus Christ.

00:20.000 --> 00:25.840
It's in the perfect shape of the cross of our Lord Jesus Christ.

00:25.840 --> 00:30.740
Or as I pointed out, a bit like the cross, a sort of wobbly crucifix better suited to

00:30.740 --> 00:33.240
the crucifixion of mermaids.

00:33.240 --> 00:37.440
But now he's at it again, and I bet you know what Giglio's going to say.

00:37.440 --> 00:42.600
Here's a distant gas cloud in our galaxy that looks exactly like our Lord Jesus Christ,

00:42.600 --> 00:43.600
right Louis?

00:43.600 --> 00:50.420
And as it is oscillating you can see what's happening, it's shooting a radio frequency

00:50.420 --> 00:51.680
out of itself.

00:51.680 --> 00:56.520
Oh, okay, maybe it's not supposed to be a galactic portrait of our Lord Jesus Christ.

00:56.520 --> 00:58.800
Um, I give up.

00:58.800 --> 01:03.560
Because when they aimed the radio telescopes at the Vela Pulsar, this is what they heard.

01:03.560 --> 01:08.440
Oh, I know, I know, the Vela Pulsar is going to sound like a choir of angels.

01:08.440 --> 01:09.440
L'OCCOLIA!

01:09.440 --> 01:10.440
L'OCCOLIA!

01:10.440 --> 01:11.440
L'OCCOLIA!

01:11.440 --> 01:12.440
L'OCCOLIA!

01:12.440 --> 01:13.440
L'OCCOLIA!

01:13.440 --> 01:14.440
L'OCCOLIA!

01:14.440 --> 01:15.440
L'OCCOLIA!

01:15.440 --> 01:16.440
Right Louis?

01:16.440 --> 01:17.440
Sounds like that, doesn't it Louis?

01:17.440 --> 01:20.920
This is what from a thousand light years away the Vela Pulsar sounds like right now.

01:21.160 --> 01:22.160
This is it, listen to this.

01:22.160 --> 01:40.000
Now I don't know about you but that blew me away, I'm thinking wow, this is incredible.

01:40.000 --> 01:41.040
You're like well what does it mean?

01:41.040 --> 01:44.960
I don't know, is that some kind of Morse code for something or what does all that mean?

01:44.960 --> 01:50.040
I don't know what it means but I don't want to go too crazy here but maybe the Vela Pulsar

01:50.160 --> 01:55.400
got wind somehow innately of Psalm 148 verse 3 and says praise him sun and moon and all

01:55.400 --> 01:58.520
you shining stars, we're a shining star, we should praise him.

01:58.520 --> 01:59.520
Well how are we going to praise him?

01:59.520 --> 02:05.400
I know, let's oscillate 11 times a second on our axis and see if we can send a radio

02:05.400 --> 02:13.920
signal into the universe that would join in the symphony of God's praise from all creation.

02:13.920 --> 02:18.720
Yeah, yep, that's exactly what happened Louis.

02:18.720 --> 02:23.120
A neutron star was just sitting there with nothing to do after the star it came from

02:23.120 --> 02:28.840
exploded and collapsed and it thought, because it has a brain after all, it thought, according

02:28.840 --> 02:34.820
to a psalm I heard on a distant planet, I'm supposed to be singing praises to some deity.

02:34.820 --> 02:36.340
With me so far?

02:36.340 --> 02:40.640
Now although this neutron star had a brain and was very smart, it didn't have lungs

02:40.640 --> 02:46.440
or a larynx or a mouth, come on that would be silly, so through sheer willpower it made

02:46.440 --> 02:52.560
itself start spinning, just like a mountain can't, because it knew that by spinning 11

02:52.560 --> 02:58.100
times a second it would eject x-rays and gamma rays that would make beautiful music, or at

02:58.100 --> 03:00.000
least the sound of a jackhammer.

03:00.000 --> 03:02.120
I don't want to go too crazy here.

03:02.120 --> 03:06.700
No, of course not Louis, I'm glad you've kept this real and haven't ventured into the world

03:06.700 --> 03:08.760
of lunatic fantasy.

03:08.760 --> 03:13.280
And it's fascinating to learn that choirs like this one are wasting their time because

03:13.280 --> 03:19.040
lovely as these melodic harmonies sound to our ears, God would be just as happy with

03:19.040 --> 03:20.040
this.

03:20.040 --> 03:32.920
However, there are a few things that make this intelligent pulsar idea kind of implausible

03:32.920 --> 03:34.080
anyway.

03:34.080 --> 03:42.360
When I say a few, I actually mean about 3520, but I'll save us both time and give you one.

03:42.360 --> 03:47.180
The first thing that defeats this idea that a pulsar is singing from a hymn sheet is the

03:47.180 --> 03:49.120
first law of the movie Alien.

03:49.120 --> 03:54.000
In space, no one can hear you scream.

03:54.000 --> 03:57.680
That's not just a clever tagline, it's a fact of physics.

03:57.680 --> 04:02.180
Sound needs a medium in which to propagate, because sound waves are compression waves,

04:02.180 --> 04:04.700
they have to compress something.

04:04.700 --> 04:09.680
So for example here's the Mormon Tabernacle Choir singing How Great Thou Art at normal

04:09.680 --> 04:11.520
atmospheric pressure.

04:11.520 --> 04:15.640
Now we've sealed the temple around them to make it airtight, so watch what happens as

04:15.640 --> 04:31.640
we suck the air out and replicate the vacuum of space.

04:31.640 --> 04:36.400
And no, the choir would not explode as they do in sci-fi movies, but just before they

04:36.400 --> 04:41.840
pass out and die of asphyxiation, notice how their singing becomes inaudible as less air

04:41.840 --> 04:45.040
becomes available to propagate the sound waves.

04:45.040 --> 04:50.360
So this pulsar isn't singing the praises of our Lord, even if you went right up to it,

04:50.360 --> 04:55.960
all you'd hear is this.

04:55.960 --> 05:00.080
What you're playing to your impressionable audience, Louis, are just computer-generated

05:00.080 --> 05:04.720
sound waves following the pattern of electromagnetic emissions.

05:04.960 --> 05:08.560
And just one other thing I guess I ought to comment on, I didn't realise that not only

05:08.560 --> 05:13.340
do stars have a brain, but they can exercise free will as well.

05:13.340 --> 05:17.760
They can decide whether to praise God or not praise God, and I guess that means they can

05:17.760 --> 05:22.380
decide whether they want to be religious, maybe there are atheist stars.

05:22.380 --> 05:27.000
And if they don't have free will, because according to the Bible only humans have that,

05:27.000 --> 05:32.760
then the only alternative is that God deliberately designed these neutron stars to eject charged

05:32.800 --> 05:35.580
particles and sing his praises.

05:35.580 --> 05:40.000
If so, what an egotistical, self-deluding deity he is.

05:40.000 --> 05:44.360
He's a bit like a teenage girl singing in front of a mirror, who plays her own fake

05:44.360 --> 05:48.160
tape of audience applause every time she finishes a performance.

05:48.160 --> 05:51.600
Louis, doesn't your God have better things to do with his time?
