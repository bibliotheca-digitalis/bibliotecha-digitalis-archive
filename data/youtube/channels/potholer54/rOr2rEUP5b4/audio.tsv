0	6000	This one is called the Vela Pulsar, and it's magnificent, a thousand light years away.
6000	9100	It's a highly magnetised neutron star.
9100	14600	You must remember this guy, Louis Giglio, who got very excited two years ago about a
14600	20000	chemical called laminin that was in the perfect shape of the cross of our Lord Jesus Christ.
20000	25840	It's in the perfect shape of the cross of our Lord Jesus Christ.
25840	30740	Or as I pointed out, a bit like the cross, a sort of wobbly crucifix better suited to
30740	33240	the crucifixion of mermaids.
33240	37440	But now he's at it again, and I bet you know what Giglio's going to say.
37440	42600	Here's a distant gas cloud in our galaxy that looks exactly like our Lord Jesus Christ,
42600	43600	right Louis?
43600	50420	And as it is oscillating you can see what's happening, it's shooting a radio frequency
50420	51680	out of itself.
51680	56520	Oh, okay, maybe it's not supposed to be a galactic portrait of our Lord Jesus Christ.
56520	58800	Um, I give up.
58800	63560	Because when they aimed the radio telescopes at the Vela Pulsar, this is what they heard.
63560	68440	Oh, I know, I know, the Vela Pulsar is going to sound like a choir of angels.
68440	69440	L'OCCOLIA!
69440	70440	L'OCCOLIA!
70440	71440	L'OCCOLIA!
71440	72440	L'OCCOLIA!
72440	73440	L'OCCOLIA!
73440	74440	L'OCCOLIA!
74440	75440	L'OCCOLIA!
75440	76440	Right Louis?
76440	77440	Sounds like that, doesn't it Louis?
77440	80920	This is what from a thousand light years away the Vela Pulsar sounds like right now.
81160	82160	This is it, listen to this.
82160	100000	Now I don't know about you but that blew me away, I'm thinking wow, this is incredible.
100000	101040	You're like well what does it mean?
101040	104960	I don't know, is that some kind of Morse code for something or what does all that mean?
104960	110040	I don't know what it means but I don't want to go too crazy here but maybe the Vela Pulsar
110160	115400	got wind somehow innately of Psalm 148 verse 3 and says praise him sun and moon and all
115400	118520	you shining stars, we're a shining star, we should praise him.
118520	119520	Well how are we going to praise him?
119520	125400	I know, let's oscillate 11 times a second on our axis and see if we can send a radio
125400	133920	signal into the universe that would join in the symphony of God's praise from all creation.
133920	138720	Yeah, yep, that's exactly what happened Louis.
138720	143120	A neutron star was just sitting there with nothing to do after the star it came from
143120	148840	exploded and collapsed and it thought, because it has a brain after all, it thought, according
148840	154820	to a psalm I heard on a distant planet, I'm supposed to be singing praises to some deity.
154820	156340	With me so far?
156340	160640	Now although this neutron star had a brain and was very smart, it didn't have lungs
160640	166440	or a larynx or a mouth, come on that would be silly, so through sheer willpower it made
166440	172560	itself start spinning, just like a mountain can't, because it knew that by spinning 11
172560	178100	times a second it would eject x-rays and gamma rays that would make beautiful music, or at
178100	180000	least the sound of a jackhammer.
180000	182120	I don't want to go too crazy here.
182120	186700	No, of course not Louis, I'm glad you've kept this real and haven't ventured into the world
186700	188760	of lunatic fantasy.
188760	193280	And it's fascinating to learn that choirs like this one are wasting their time because
193280	199040	lovely as these melodic harmonies sound to our ears, God would be just as happy with
199040	200040	this.
200040	212920	However, there are a few things that make this intelligent pulsar idea kind of implausible
212920	214080	anyway.
214080	222360	When I say a few, I actually mean about 3520, but I'll save us both time and give you one.
222360	227180	The first thing that defeats this idea that a pulsar is singing from a hymn sheet is the
227180	229120	first law of the movie Alien.
229120	234000	In space, no one can hear you scream.
234000	237680	That's not just a clever tagline, it's a fact of physics.
237680	242180	Sound needs a medium in which to propagate, because sound waves are compression waves,
242180	244700	they have to compress something.
244700	249680	So for example here's the Mormon Tabernacle Choir singing How Great Thou Art at normal
249680	251520	atmospheric pressure.
251520	255640	Now we've sealed the temple around them to make it airtight, so watch what happens as
255640	271640	we suck the air out and replicate the vacuum of space.
271640	276400	And no, the choir would not explode as they do in sci-fi movies, but just before they
276400	281840	pass out and die of asphyxiation, notice how their singing becomes inaudible as less air
281840	285040	becomes available to propagate the sound waves.
285040	290360	So this pulsar isn't singing the praises of our Lord, even if you went right up to it,
290360	295960	all you'd hear is this.
295960	300080	What you're playing to your impressionable audience, Louis, are just computer-generated
300080	304720	sound waves following the pattern of electromagnetic emissions.
304960	308560	And just one other thing I guess I ought to comment on, I didn't realise that not only
308560	313340	do stars have a brain, but they can exercise free will as well.
313340	317760	They can decide whether to praise God or not praise God, and I guess that means they can
317760	322380	decide whether they want to be religious, maybe there are atheist stars.
322380	327000	And if they don't have free will, because according to the Bible only humans have that,
327000	332760	then the only alternative is that God deliberately designed these neutron stars to eject charged
332800	335580	particles and sing his praises.
335580	340000	If so, what an egotistical, self-deluding deity he is.
340000	344360	He's a bit like a teenage girl singing in front of a mirror, who plays her own fake
344360	348160	tape of audience applause every time she finishes a performance.
348160	351600	Louis, doesn't your God have better things to do with his time?
