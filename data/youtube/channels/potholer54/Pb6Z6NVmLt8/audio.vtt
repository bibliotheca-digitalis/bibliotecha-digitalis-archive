I want to start with the observation that a dog can never give birth to a non-dog.

00:09.000 --> 00:12.000
Nobody's ever seen a dog produce a non-dog.

00:12.000 --> 00:16.000
You may get a big dog or a little dog, I understand, but you're going to get a dog.

00:16.000 --> 00:20.000
It's good to know that creationism and evolution are perfectly in tune on this.

00:20.000 --> 00:25.000
If a dog didn't give birth to a dog, the whole theory of evolution would fall to the ground.

00:25.000 --> 00:30.000
And both sides agree, I hope, that the offspring are always slightly different to the parents.

00:30.000 --> 00:36.000
And most creationist preachers even agree that these small changes accumulate over time to produce different types of animals.

00:36.000 --> 00:40.000
And it could be the dog, the wolf, and the coyote had a common ancestor.

00:40.000 --> 00:49.000
The only difference is that creationists believe no matter how many changes there are, the animals are still the same kind, meaning that they can bring forth.

00:49.000 --> 00:54.000
See, if they can bring forth, they're the same kind. Simple definition, can they bring forth?

00:54.000 --> 00:57.000
Let's take the example of the greenish warbler.

00:57.000 --> 01:05.000
It doesn't give birth to a rat or an albatross, it gives birth to another greenish warbler, with, of course, slight genetic differences.

01:05.000 --> 01:08.000
Over successive generations, these differences accumulate.

01:08.000 --> 01:16.000
If some warblers move into new territory, their descendants are eventually going to look very different to the distant cousins they left behind.

01:16.000 --> 01:21.000
But they still interbreed, so as the Bible would say, they're the same kind.

01:21.000 --> 01:27.000
And that's exactly what happened to the greenish warbler, which biologists think originated in the southern Himalayas.

01:27.000 --> 01:34.000
As the species expanded eastwards and northwards around the Tibetan plateau, it progressively changed.

01:34.000 --> 01:39.000
But despite the differences, each type of warbler could still interbreed with its neighbours.

01:39.000 --> 01:43.000
Creationists would call this a classic example of microevolution.

01:43.000 --> 01:48.000
Animals change, but they're still the same kind. They can still interbreed.

01:48.000 --> 01:52.000
The same thing happened with the warblers that spread around the west of the Tibetan plateau.

01:52.000 --> 02:00.000
As they adapted to their new environments, they changed, but each type of warbler could still interbreed with warblers from neighbouring groups.

02:00.000 --> 02:07.000
Then the two lines came together to the north of the Tibetan plateau, and that's where the creationist theory comes unstuck.

02:07.000 --> 02:15.000
Because by now, each line has evolved so much, and become so different to the ancestral greenish warbler left behind in the Himalayas,

02:15.000 --> 02:18.000
that the neighbouring species can't bring forth after their own kind.

02:18.000 --> 02:23.000
So according to the biblical definition, they must be different kinds.

02:23.000 --> 02:28.000
Let's just see what happens as we follow the evolutionary trail of these warblers northwards.

02:28.000 --> 02:31.000
Same kind, same kind, whoops!

02:31.000 --> 02:37.000
If they're all the same kind, why can't these two interbreed? That would make them a different kind.

02:37.000 --> 02:42.000
But we know this one can interbreed with this one, so they must be the same kind.

02:42.000 --> 02:44.000
Let's follow the trail back again.

02:44.000 --> 02:47.000
Same kind, same kind, same kind, dope!

02:47.000 --> 02:49.000
We've hit the same problem.

02:49.000 --> 02:54.000
These ones at the end can't be the same kind, because they can't interbreed.

02:54.000 --> 02:57.000
This phenomenon is called ring species.

02:57.000 --> 03:04.000
This may not fit with the biblical idea of kinds, but the existence of ring species is perfectly compatible with evolution.

03:04.000 --> 03:09.000
In fact, we'd expect to get ring species according to the theory of evolution.

03:09.000 --> 03:15.000
This is because in the real world, evolution doesn't produce little boxes dividing organisms into kinds.

03:15.000 --> 03:20.000
Evolution is a gradation, a slow change from one type of organism into another.

03:20.000 --> 03:28.000
And when it hits on a type that's perfectly adapted to its environment, then that type stays much longer and changes much more slowly.

03:28.000 --> 03:34.000
And the result is that some animals that are closely related genetically breed very easily.

03:34.000 --> 03:40.000
Once they drift apart, they don't breed so easily, then with great difficulty, and finally not at all.

03:40.000 --> 03:46.000
This is called speciation, and we can see it in the fossil record as we go through layers of sedimentary rock.

03:46.000 --> 03:52.000
And because of ring species, we can see it happen as animals move and evolve geographically.
