00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:09,000
I want to start with the observation that a dog can never give birth to a non-dog.

2
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:12,000
Nobody's ever seen a dog produce a non-dog.

3
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:16,000
You may get a big dog or a little dog, I understand, but you're going to get a dog.

4
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:20,000
It's good to know that creationism and evolution are perfectly in tune on this.

5
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:25,000
If a dog didn't give birth to a dog, the whole theory of evolution would fall to the ground.

6
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:30,000
And both sides agree, I hope, that the offspring are always slightly different to the parents.

7
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:36,000
And most creationist preachers even agree that these small changes accumulate over time to produce different types of animals.

8
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:40,000
And it could be the dog, the wolf, and the coyote had a common ancestor.

9
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:49,000
The only difference is that creationists believe no matter how many changes there are, the animals are still the same kind, meaning that they can bring forth.

10
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:54,000
See, if they can bring forth, they're the same kind. Simple definition, can they bring forth?

11
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:57,000
Let's take the example of the greenish warbler.

12
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:05,000
It doesn't give birth to a rat or an albatross, it gives birth to another greenish warbler, with, of course, slight genetic differences.

13
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:08,000
Over successive generations, these differences accumulate.

14
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:16,000
If some warblers move into new territory, their descendants are eventually going to look very different to the distant cousins they left behind.

15
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:21,000
But they still interbreed, so as the Bible would say, they're the same kind.

16
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:27,000
And that's exactly what happened to the greenish warbler, which biologists think originated in the southern Himalayas.

17
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:34,000
As the species expanded eastwards and northwards around the Tibetan plateau, it progressively changed.

18
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:39,000
But despite the differences, each type of warbler could still interbreed with its neighbours.

19
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:43,000
Creationists would call this a classic example of microevolution.

20
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:48,000
Animals change, but they're still the same kind. They can still interbreed.

21
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:52,000
The same thing happened with the warblers that spread around the west of the Tibetan plateau.

22
00:01:52,000 --> 00:02:00,000
As they adapted to their new environments, they changed, but each type of warbler could still interbreed with warblers from neighbouring groups.

23
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:07,000
Then the two lines came together to the north of the Tibetan plateau, and that's where the creationist theory comes unstuck.

24
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:15,000
Because by now, each line has evolved so much, and become so different to the ancestral greenish warbler left behind in the Himalayas,

25
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:18,000
that the neighbouring species can't bring forth after their own kind.

26
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:23,000
So according to the biblical definition, they must be different kinds.

27
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:28,000
Let's just see what happens as we follow the evolutionary trail of these warblers northwards.

28
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:31,000
Same kind, same kind, whoops!

29
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:37,000
If they're all the same kind, why can't these two interbreed? That would make them a different kind.

30
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:42,000
But we know this one can interbreed with this one, so they must be the same kind.

31
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,000
Let's follow the trail back again.

32
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:47,000
Same kind, same kind, same kind, dope!

33
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:49,000
We've hit the same problem.

34
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:54,000
These ones at the end can't be the same kind, because they can't interbreed.

35
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:57,000
This phenomenon is called ring species.

36
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:04,000
This may not fit with the biblical idea of kinds, but the existence of ring species is perfectly compatible with evolution.

37
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:09,000
In fact, we'd expect to get ring species according to the theory of evolution.

38
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:15,000
This is because in the real world, evolution doesn't produce little boxes dividing organisms into kinds.

39
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:20,000
Evolution is a gradation, a slow change from one type of organism into another.

40
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:28,000
And when it hits on a type that's perfectly adapted to its environment, then that type stays much longer and changes much more slowly.

41
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:34,000
And the result is that some animals that are closely related genetically breed very easily.

42
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:40,000
Once they drift apart, they don't breed so easily, then with great difficulty, and finally not at all.

43
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:46,000
This is called speciation, and we can see it in the fossil record as we go through layers of sedimentary rock.

44
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:52,000
And because of ring species, we can see it happen as animals move and evolve geographically.
