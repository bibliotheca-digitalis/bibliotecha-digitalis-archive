0	9000	I want to start with the observation that a dog can never give birth to a non-dog.
9000	12000	Nobody's ever seen a dog produce a non-dog.
12000	16000	You may get a big dog or a little dog, I understand, but you're going to get a dog.
16000	20000	It's good to know that creationism and evolution are perfectly in tune on this.
20000	25000	If a dog didn't give birth to a dog, the whole theory of evolution would fall to the ground.
25000	30000	And both sides agree, I hope, that the offspring are always slightly different to the parents.
30000	36000	And most creationist preachers even agree that these small changes accumulate over time to produce different types of animals.
36000	40000	And it could be the dog, the wolf, and the coyote had a common ancestor.
40000	49000	The only difference is that creationists believe no matter how many changes there are, the animals are still the same kind, meaning that they can bring forth.
49000	54000	See, if they can bring forth, they're the same kind. Simple definition, can they bring forth?
54000	57000	Let's take the example of the greenish warbler.
57000	65000	It doesn't give birth to a rat or an albatross, it gives birth to another greenish warbler, with, of course, slight genetic differences.
65000	68000	Over successive generations, these differences accumulate.
68000	76000	If some warblers move into new territory, their descendants are eventually going to look very different to the distant cousins they left behind.
76000	81000	But they still interbreed, so as the Bible would say, they're the same kind.
81000	87000	And that's exactly what happened to the greenish warbler, which biologists think originated in the southern Himalayas.
87000	94000	As the species expanded eastwards and northwards around the Tibetan plateau, it progressively changed.
94000	99000	But despite the differences, each type of warbler could still interbreed with its neighbours.
99000	103000	Creationists would call this a classic example of microevolution.
103000	108000	Animals change, but they're still the same kind. They can still interbreed.
108000	112000	The same thing happened with the warblers that spread around the west of the Tibetan plateau.
112000	120000	As they adapted to their new environments, they changed, but each type of warbler could still interbreed with warblers from neighbouring groups.
120000	127000	Then the two lines came together to the north of the Tibetan plateau, and that's where the creationist theory comes unstuck.
127000	135000	Because by now, each line has evolved so much, and become so different to the ancestral greenish warbler left behind in the Himalayas,
135000	138000	that the neighbouring species can't bring forth after their own kind.
138000	143000	So according to the biblical definition, they must be different kinds.
143000	148000	Let's just see what happens as we follow the evolutionary trail of these warblers northwards.
148000	151000	Same kind, same kind, whoops!
151000	157000	If they're all the same kind, why can't these two interbreed? That would make them a different kind.
157000	162000	But we know this one can interbreed with this one, so they must be the same kind.
162000	164000	Let's follow the trail back again.
164000	167000	Same kind, same kind, same kind, dope!
167000	169000	We've hit the same problem.
169000	174000	These ones at the end can't be the same kind, because they can't interbreed.
174000	177000	This phenomenon is called ring species.
177000	184000	This may not fit with the biblical idea of kinds, but the existence of ring species is perfectly compatible with evolution.
184000	189000	In fact, we'd expect to get ring species according to the theory of evolution.
189000	195000	This is because in the real world, evolution doesn't produce little boxes dividing organisms into kinds.
195000	200000	Evolution is a gradation, a slow change from one type of organism into another.
200000	208000	And when it hits on a type that's perfectly adapted to its environment, then that type stays much longer and changes much more slowly.
208000	214000	And the result is that some animals that are closely related genetically breed very easily.
214000	220000	Once they drift apart, they don't breed so easily, then with great difficulty, and finally not at all.
220000	226000	This is called speciation, and we can see it in the fossil record as we go through layers of sedimentary rock.
226000	232000	And because of ring species, we can see it happen as animals move and evolve geographically.
