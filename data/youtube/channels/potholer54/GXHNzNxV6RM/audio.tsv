0	3040	I'm sure you've all heard the expression, the moon is made of cheese.
3680	7920	Understandable because the moon does look a bit like a big round cheese,
7920	12080	but in fact the correct expression is, the moon is made of green cheese,
12080	16640	and the first written record of it comes from John Heywood in the 16th century,
16640	21360	as part of a collection of old sayings. But of course the moon isn't green, so
21360	25760	where does this idea come from? Is it possible the original saying,
25760	30640	going back centuries before Heywood, was that the moon is made of cream cheese,
30640	33840	and ancient beliefs are often based on a kernel of truth?
34800	38560	Cream cheese is a carbon-based compound made of elements that are commonly found
38560	42480	throughout the universe. This is what it looks like under a microscope.
43040	46960	So is it possible that a similar compound does exist on the moon?
48000	53040	We know that cheese is formed when proteins break down into peptides and then amino acids,
53040	57520	and finally into carboxylic acids through a process called liposilis.
58240	61840	Now you might think, surely you can't get proteins on the moon,
61840	67040	they're complex organic chemicals. Yes they are, but amino acids are not,
67840	72800	and we know that amino acids are present on the moon because they've been found in meteorites.
73360	79040	So there's no reason why the same chemical process that turns amino acids into carboxylic acids on
79040	83680	Earth couldn't happen on the moon. But is there any evidence for it?
84400	88640	When Apollo astronauts came back from the moon, NASA announced that the samples they
88640	92880	brought with them were volcanic rock, and they said maybe we could mine the moon for
92880	97680	valuable minerals. And because everyone trusts NASA, no one questioned it.
98400	104800	But I'd urge you to check for yourselves. This is what moon rock looks like under a microscope.
104800	109840	NASA claims it's volcanic, but here's rock from the Earth that we know is volcanic,
109840	113760	and it looks nothing like the supposedly volcanic rock they found on the moon.
114560	117840	So what does it look like? Well let's go back to that
117840	122640	microscopic image of cream cheese that we saw earlier. Notice any similarity?
123600	129600	But why, you might ask, would NASA want to fake all this? Well just follow the money. Here's
129600	135040	NASA's budget as a percentage of the federal budget over the last 60 years. You'd have to
135040	139600	be blind not to see that their most profitable years were when they were sending rockets to
139600	144800	the moon. As long as they can keep up the pretence that there are valuable minerals there, they can
144800	149840	ask for billions of dollars in funding. But the movement to expose NASA's fraud
149840	154480	is growing. There's currently a debate over this issue in the scientific community,
154480	159280	so you need to keep an open mind and listen to both sides of the argument.
159280	163760	There was a huge controversy earlier this year when a peer-reviewed paper was published
163760	169120	providing more evidence that the moon is made of cheese. The reason you haven't heard about this
169120	174560	is because as soon as the paper was published, the author was fired from his job stacking boxes
174560	179920	at a Walmart superstore, ostensibly because he forgot to refrigerate a carton of blueberry
179920	185840	swirl ice cream. But the real reason is that he dared to go against the scientific consensus.
186720	191360	Not only that, everyone who's read the paper mysteriously disappeared
191360	195680	or ended up dead in a dumpster. The only conclusion we can draw-
195680	196180	NO!
198560	204080	I apologise for that rant by my evil twin brother, but he was going a bit too far with this
204080	209440	conspiracy. Just in case anyone was beginning to doubt it, the moon isn't made of cheese,
209440	213920	but I suppose some people will already be sufficiently convinced that they'll just assume
214160	219280	I'm part of the conspiracy to cover that up. After all, people are prepared to believe videos
219280	224640	that claim the Earth is expanding. If I'd made up something mildly less absurd, like
224640	229600	the moon is going to crash into the Earth, it would be very easy to dazzle gullible people
229600	235280	with lots of numbers and diagrams and convince them of anything. Don't just take my word for it,
235280	241200	try it yourselves. Think up the most outlandish conspiracy you can, in other words a conspiracy
241200	247120	of scientists to fake data to cover up what you think is the truth, and build on it. Don't just
247120	252880	make stuff up out of thin air, do what real conspiracy theorists do, make it plausible.
252880	256800	Cherry pick some real facts, just make sure you draw the wrong conclusions.
258000	263440	It's surprisingly easy and actually quite fun. So in this video I'm going to look at why people
263440	269440	trust blogs and videos like these more than science textbooks. Of course there are psychology
269440	274560	papers that have studied the problem in depth, but their conclusions are not rocket science.
274560	279680	There's a pretty obvious pattern in why people are drawn into believing junk science videos and
279680	285120	blogs. The trick is to shame them into thinking they're closed-minded and stupid if they just
285120	290480	follow what they're taught by the government, i.e. science teachers, but smart and enlightened if
290480	296000	they believe in a conspiracy that few people know about. You may have failed science at school,
296000	300080	but now you're somebody. You're on equal terms with a Harvard professor.
300800	305760	And use certain buzzwords that I've seen come up time and time again in discussions with
305760	312000	conspiracy theorists on my channel. One of the most popular mantras is do your own research,
312000	316800	which of course doesn't mean pick up a textbook and learn about the subject, it means google
316800	322320	blogs that are easy to understand and echo your newfound beliefs, and blogs that are dressed up
322320	328320	to look like peer-reviewed scientific papers. Oh yes, that paper. Well, the journal of eclectic
328320	334560	science is a journal my evil twin brother made up. All it takes is a build your own webpage app.
334560	339280	The journal also contains cutting edge research into spoon bending, and there's a paper showing
339280	344640	that Elvis is alive. If you think that starting your own scientific journal to promote your
344640	350720	beliefs is a bit far-fetched, well it's already been done. This impressive looking journal was
350720	356080	started by two Irish brothers who submitted their own papers to themselves, peer reviewed
356080	361360	their own papers, approved them without changes, and published them on their own blog, which they
361360	367200	called Open Peer Review Journal. Now you might think, who in their right mind would fall for
367200	374720	something like that? Well people do, and they're citing it. When I floated the idea that the
374720	380400	internet might be seriously undermining real science back in 2011, I said this.
380960	385600	When Cliff Clavin expounded his knowledge in the barroom at Cheers, he had an audience of less
385600	391360	than a dozen people. These days, Cliffy would undoubtedly have his own website, and to disguise
391360	396560	the fact that it's written by a mailman, he can make it anonymous, or he can give himself any
396560	402240	title he likes, and claim a specialist background he doesn't have. That was eight years ago.
402800	407600	In fact, I first mooted the idea more than five years earlier than that, at a time when people
407600	413520	still knew who Cliff Clavin was. But back then, I still found it hard to believe that a useful
413520	418720	tool like this newfangled internet could be responsible for undermining two hundred years
418720	424880	of published science. Surely I thought normal, intelligent people wouldn't fall for this.
424880	429760	We'd never have, say, a President of the United States gullible enough to believe whatever he
429760	440960	sees on the internet. Look, it doesn't matter if this was a Republican or a Democratic President,
440960	444720	we should all be concerned if our leaders are this easily misled.
445520	449280	It's ironic that we now have a world of information at our fingertips.
449280	454480	People can check any fact, from the mass of Jupiter to the chemical constituents of asparagus,
454480	459200	without having to hunt through their local library. And yet the result has not been an
459200	465280	increase in public knowledge, but a dumbing down. What are people learning? That evolution never
465280	470880	happened. That putting crystals on your body draws out negative energy. And yes, this really
470880	478720	is a growing belief that the Earth is flat. In April 2018, a YouGov poll found that 7%
478720	484960	of Americans now think the Earth is or may be flat. That's 23 million people,
484960	490240	in one of the best educated countries in the world. It's not often I agree with creationist
490240	495680	Ray Comfort. In fact, I don't think I ever have. But he did manage to get this one right.
495680	501120	If you're a Christian, and you believe that the Earth is flat, please keep it to yourself.
501120	506720	Even if you have Bible verses that you think prove it, verses that are obviously metaphoric.
506720	512160	This is because in many people's minds, you'll be perceived intellectually on the level of someone
512160	516080	who thinks the moon is made of cheese. If they know you're a Christian,
516080	520160	insisting that the Earth is flat won't exactly help your credibility.
520160	522800	Yeah, I wouldn't want to make ourselves look stupid, right?
522800	525680	Behold, the atheist's nightmare.
525680	530800	But it's not Christians Ray has to worry about. Most of them have no problem with science.
530800	536560	It's his fellow fundamentalists. According to the same YouGov poll, the more religious you are,
536560	541280	the more likely you are to believe that the Earth is flat. That's not surprising,
541280	544880	because people who are inclined to see a conspiracy in one field of science
544880	550240	tend to believe in conspiracies everywhere. Tony Heller, whose blog is full of climate
550240	555360	conspiracies, also gives vent to the idea that the Sandy Hook School massacre might have been
555360	560080	a conspiracy, as well as the conspiracy theory that Obama was born in Kenya.
560800	565600	The guy who made this video about a flat Earth also thinks NASA faked the moon landings.
566320	569680	Once you start believing everyone's conspiring to hoax you,
569680	572240	that means everyone's conspiring to hoax you.
572880	579200	The fact is that all these conspiracy theories use exactly the same modus operandi. Cherrypick,
579200	584080	misrepresent, misquote and invent a fictitious motive for the conspiracy,
584080	588400	which is why it'll be so easy for you to build your own if you want to try it.
589280	595440	The reason for this growing trend in conspiracies is best illustrated by the YouGov survey on flat
595440	600800	Earth belief. The younger you are, the more likely you are to believe in a flat Earth.
600800	607760	94% of people over 55 accept that the Earth is round. Only 66% of millennials do.
608480	612880	And where do millennials get their information? No prizes for guessing.
612880	615920	Don't just take my word for it. Look it up yourself.
615920	618480	There it is again. Do your own research.
619200	623600	Now, there's nothing wrong with that if you want to look up how the ancient Greeks worked
623600	629280	out that the Earth was round over 2000 years ago and how it's been confirmed by every branch
629280	634640	of physics since then. But of course these videos are aimed at people who aren't that much into
634640	639600	science. They're not going to bother with textbooks and educational websites that contain
639600	644000	complicated things like numbers. They'll google sites like this.
645440	650000	After all, 5% of respondents say they used to believe the Earth was round,
650000	654960	then as recommended they did their own research and came to the conclusion that there's some
654960	660480	merit to the belief that the Earth is flat. So it's pretty obvious where they did their research.
661600	664800	Google searches may not convince them that the Earth is flat,
664800	668400	but it exposes them to enough bullcrap to sow a seed of doubt.
669360	674080	That's all junk science needs. Once you believe scientists might be faking everything,
674080	678960	you'll move quickly on to why, and that leads to the argument that they're doing it to get
678960	685040	more research grant money. Why else? So let's see how this conspiracy works.
685840	690160	In my geology class there was only one high achiever who went on to do a PhD.
690720	695760	This isn't her by the way. The rest of us were just humdrum geology graduates who took up
695760	700640	well-paid jobs in the oil industry because the intellectual demands aren't that great and the
700640	706320	money is good. Most of my classmates went on to senior management roles in the oil industry
706320	712480	where the pay got even better. Helen, the one who did the PhD, could have easily landed a similar
712480	718640	job because she was the smart one. But she wasn't interested in an industry job. She was motivated
718640	723920	by a burning interest in geology and a desire to make new discoveries and further the limits
723920	729760	of scientific knowledge. Don't be surprised some people are just like that. The obsessive
729760	735120	inquisitive nature of researchers is how science has advanced for the last 500 years.
736080	740480	In the years after graduation Helen never mentioned that she'd been initiated into this
740480	746880	secret worldwide conspiracy but here's how it must have gone. After Helen successfully applied for a
746880	751600	grant to study carboniferous ocean environments her tutor would have broken the news to her.
752160	757120	Sorry Helen but if you're going to find any evidence that's going to overturn accepted science
757760	762160	in other words everything that's already been published you're not allowed to publish that
762160	766000	you have to fake the data to cover it up but there will be money in it for you.
766800	770960	Let's just imagine Helen didn't tell the tutor that this was an outrageous request
770960	775040	but she's curious as to how anyone can profit from such a duplicitous scam.
775600	780400	Her tutor would have told her you'll get grant money it will allow you to do more research
781280	786800	and when Helen asks what's the point in doing more research if that entails simply faking more data
786800	792400	and never coming up with any discoveries her tutor would have said no point at all your entire
792400	797280	research career would be pointless you'll never stand out and your work will never be recognised
797280	803360	or produce anything groundbreaking or original and you'll never benefit financially the only benefit
803360	808720	that you get is to continue this charade until you retire without any self-respect and then die
809280	815520	to which Helen must have said sounds like a plan to me and that's why she supposedly took up a
815520	822080	poorly paid research job faking data all to get grants to do more data faking rather than simply
822080	828640	move into a worthwhile and well-paid job in mining or oil exploration or dam construction and not
828640	834000	only Helen agreed to this the same conversation happened with every PhD candidate involved in
834000	839840	these controversial areas of science they joined a conspiracy that involves not only researchers
839840	845840	but also journal editors Nobel Prize committee members everyone who works at geological surveys
845840	851360	around the world the Royal Society the National Academy of Sciences and a host of other scientific
851360	856880	institutes and presumably their spouses and partners apparently they're all in on it
858320	863840	when I made my last video the story of the earth in 33 minutes I seem to have triggered all the
863840	869440	various conspiracy theorists from creationists who didn't accept evolution to flat earthers who
869440	874880	refused to accept that the world is round there were people who didn't accept plate tectonics
874880	880720	or the role of co2 in climate change even people who believed Osama bin Laden was still alive
880720	885920	or that he was a US government agent and bin laden was only in the video as part of an interesting
885920	892720	story about geological unconformities the weirdest conspiracy theorists of the lot were those who saw
892720	899120	a conspiracy in the fact that the video was 33 minutes long I had no idea what they were on about
899120	904800	until I looked it up and apparently the number 33 has some sort of dark masonic connection
905840	911600	well that's a bit awkward we can kiss goodbye to most scientific solutions if they're going to be
911600	918320	put in a conspiracy basket whenever they use the number 33 remember my video was simply explaining
918320	924320	what geology students learn at university there's nothing controversial about it but those who've
924320	929280	decided some of this conflicts with their religious or ideological beliefs want the
929280	936080	subject taught with those bits taken out well sorry science doesn't work that way it isn't a
936080	942320	pick and mix all the disciplines within geology are interconnected every piece of evidence is
942320	949040	related to and supports other pieces of evidence ignore one part and the rest makes no sense
949040	954080	like pulling away the leg of a stool but if you're already convinced that scientists are
954080	959760	conspiring to fake their research then it's obviously no good me trying to provide evidence
959760	964640	because evidence comes from peer-reviewed studies and of course you'll just believe these are part
964640	970320	of the conspiracy so I'll just say this peer-reviewed studies are the basis of all
970320	975600	scientific research they're the basis of science textbooks they're the basis of everything science
975600	980800	students learn at the university they're the basis of every piece of technology you use
980800	986720	and the standard of living you now enjoy even if you didn't know it for example this paper by
986720	992720	watson and crick and this paper by kerry mullis are the basis of dna analysis used for everything
992720	997760	from catching murder suspects to breeding endangered animals and they're the basis of
997760	1003520	gmos that give you things like cheap breakfast cereals studies are the properties of cathode
1003520	1010160	ray tubes in the early 20th century led to the development of television this paper was one of
1010160	1015520	several landmark papers that established plate tectonic theory that's used to predict earthquake
1015520	1021680	patterns and mitigate earthquake disasters even medical papers which are most frequently prone
1021680	1027040	to errors because of the nature of the subject are still robust enough to make huge advances in
1027040	1032480	treating illness and disease and peer-reviewed papers are still paving the way for technologies
1032480	1037680	of the future and don't forget each of these landmark papers was dependent on hundreds of
1037680	1042640	other peer-reviewed papers that went before them which the authors cited and the landmark
1042640	1048000	papers themselves have been cited by hundreds of other papers that came afterwards and advanced
1048000	1053680	our scientific knowledge even further so before you start rubbishing peer-reviewed papers that
1053680	1059440	are the basis of science it's worth finding out how you've benefited from them and taking a leaf
1059440	1063920	out of my own subject you're benefiting from the system of peer-reviewed scientific publishing
1063920	1070000	every time you fill up your car knowing where to look for oil is no longer a matter of dumb luck
1070000	1075440	it's dependent on understanding different rock types their stratigraphy their physical properties
1075440	1081600	their faulting and folding patterns and their ages so the next time you find yourself musing
1081600	1087600	about how peer-reviewed studies can't be trusted while you fill up your car with gasoline and mutter
1087600	1092960	that the best way to advance science is by sitting around a table giving persuasive arguments
1092960	1098080	try instead to spend those 60 seconds thinking about where the knowledge to find that gasoline
1098080	1103440	came from and give thanks to the geologists who used it to find not only your gasoline
1103440	1109680	but also the minerals that make up your car you're welcome but if you still think that
1109680	1114400	geology is nothing more than a huge conspiracy or just the link between earthquakes and plate
1114400	1120640	tectonics or the link between plate tectonics and co2 or the link between co2 and climate or the
1120640	1125680	link between climate and evolution or the link between evolution and plate tectonics if you think
1125680	1130480	any of these connections is a hoax then there's no point in teaching any geology to the next
1130480	1137040	generation of geologists because without each link the whole discipline falls apart so you might as
1137040	1142160	well fire the mineralogists and the well loggers and replace them with bloggers and youtube video
1142160	1147760	makers who thought up their own science through persuasive argument just go with what's on the
1147760	1153680	internet abolish universities stop all the research burn all the textbooks stop pumping
1153680	1160000	the gasoline abandon your car made of metal and walk back to the 14th century
1162320	1167520	thanks again to all those who are supporting this channel by donating to my favorite charity
1167520	1172560	i'm delighted to pass on an email i got from them saying that donations from my subscribers
1172560	1180800	have now reached 63 000 and one very generous donor gave 18 000 which is mind-blowing this has
1180800	1185600	allowed the model of providing health care in exchange for reforestation to spread to other
1185600	1192240	parts of the world like brazil and madagascar and here's some important news until december 31st
1192240	1197760	all contributions will be matched by a generous outside donor so anything you give between now
1197760	1203600	and the new year will be doubled if you don't know what this charity is or what it does please take
1203600	1208560	a look in the video description because it really is groundbreaking and i've been to borneo to see
1208560	1213680	the work they do for myself even if you're a conspiracy theorist and you've come to this
1213680	1219440	channel just to promote your pet conspiracy you're doing that for free so why not give a few bucks to
1219440	1224880	charity for the privilege if they had a penny for every conspiracy that's out there they'd already
1224880	1228480	be fully funded
