00:00.000 --> 00:03.040
I'm sure you've all heard the expression, the moon is made of cheese.

00:03.680 --> 00:07.920
Understandable because the moon does look a bit like a big round cheese,

00:07.920 --> 00:12.080
but in fact the correct expression is, the moon is made of green cheese,

00:12.080 --> 00:16.640
and the first written record of it comes from John Heywood in the 16th century,

00:16.640 --> 00:21.360
as part of a collection of old sayings. But of course the moon isn't green, so

00:21.360 --> 00:25.760
where does this idea come from? Is it possible the original saying,

00:25.760 --> 00:30.640
going back centuries before Heywood, was that the moon is made of cream cheese,

00:30.640 --> 00:33.840
and ancient beliefs are often based on a kernel of truth?

00:34.800 --> 00:38.560
Cream cheese is a carbon-based compound made of elements that are commonly found

00:38.560 --> 00:42.480
throughout the universe. This is what it looks like under a microscope.

00:43.040 --> 00:46.960
So is it possible that a similar compound does exist on the moon?

00:48.000 --> 00:53.040
We know that cheese is formed when proteins break down into peptides and then amino acids,

00:53.040 --> 00:57.520
and finally into carboxylic acids through a process called liposilis.

00:58.240 --> 01:01.840
Now you might think, surely you can't get proteins on the moon,

01:01.840 --> 01:07.040
they're complex organic chemicals. Yes they are, but amino acids are not,

01:07.840 --> 01:12.800
and we know that amino acids are present on the moon because they've been found in meteorites.

01:13.360 --> 01:19.040
So there's no reason why the same chemical process that turns amino acids into carboxylic acids on

01:19.040 --> 01:23.680
Earth couldn't happen on the moon. But is there any evidence for it?

01:24.400 --> 01:28.640
When Apollo astronauts came back from the moon, NASA announced that the samples they

01:28.640 --> 01:32.880
brought with them were volcanic rock, and they said maybe we could mine the moon for

01:32.880 --> 01:37.680
valuable minerals. And because everyone trusts NASA, no one questioned it.

01:38.400 --> 01:44.800
But I'd urge you to check for yourselves. This is what moon rock looks like under a microscope.

01:44.800 --> 01:49.840
NASA claims it's volcanic, but here's rock from the Earth that we know is volcanic,

01:49.840 --> 01:53.760
and it looks nothing like the supposedly volcanic rock they found on the moon.

01:54.560 --> 01:57.840
So what does it look like? Well let's go back to that

01:57.840 --> 02:02.640
microscopic image of cream cheese that we saw earlier. Notice any similarity?

02:03.600 --> 02:09.600
But why, you might ask, would NASA want to fake all this? Well just follow the money. Here's

02:09.600 --> 02:15.040
NASA's budget as a percentage of the federal budget over the last 60 years. You'd have to

02:15.040 --> 02:19.600
be blind not to see that their most profitable years were when they were sending rockets to

02:19.600 --> 02:24.800
the moon. As long as they can keep up the pretence that there are valuable minerals there, they can

02:24.800 --> 02:29.840
ask for billions of dollars in funding. But the movement to expose NASA's fraud

02:29.840 --> 02:34.480
is growing. There's currently a debate over this issue in the scientific community,

02:34.480 --> 02:39.280
so you need to keep an open mind and listen to both sides of the argument.

02:39.280 --> 02:43.760
There was a huge controversy earlier this year when a peer-reviewed paper was published

02:43.760 --> 02:49.120
providing more evidence that the moon is made of cheese. The reason you haven't heard about this

02:49.120 --> 02:54.560
is because as soon as the paper was published, the author was fired from his job stacking boxes

02:54.560 --> 02:59.920
at a Walmart superstore, ostensibly because he forgot to refrigerate a carton of blueberry

02:59.920 --> 03:05.840
swirl ice cream. But the real reason is that he dared to go against the scientific consensus.

03:06.720 --> 03:11.360
Not only that, everyone who's read the paper mysteriously disappeared

03:11.360 --> 03:15.680
or ended up dead in a dumpster. The only conclusion we can draw-

03:15.680 --> 03:16.180
NO!

03:18.560 --> 03:24.080
I apologise for that rant by my evil twin brother, but he was going a bit too far with this

03:24.080 --> 03:29.440
conspiracy. Just in case anyone was beginning to doubt it, the moon isn't made of cheese,

03:29.440 --> 03:33.920
but I suppose some people will already be sufficiently convinced that they'll just assume

03:34.160 --> 03:39.280
I'm part of the conspiracy to cover that up. After all, people are prepared to believe videos

03:39.280 --> 03:44.640
that claim the Earth is expanding. If I'd made up something mildly less absurd, like

03:44.640 --> 03:49.600
the moon is going to crash into the Earth, it would be very easy to dazzle gullible people

03:49.600 --> 03:55.280
with lots of numbers and diagrams and convince them of anything. Don't just take my word for it,

03:55.280 --> 04:01.200
try it yourselves. Think up the most outlandish conspiracy you can, in other words a conspiracy

04:01.200 --> 04:07.120
of scientists to fake data to cover up what you think is the truth, and build on it. Don't just

04:07.120 --> 04:12.880
make stuff up out of thin air, do what real conspiracy theorists do, make it plausible.

04:12.880 --> 04:16.800
Cherry pick some real facts, just make sure you draw the wrong conclusions.

04:18.000 --> 04:23.440
It's surprisingly easy and actually quite fun. So in this video I'm going to look at why people

04:23.440 --> 04:29.440
trust blogs and videos like these more than science textbooks. Of course there are psychology

04:29.440 --> 04:34.560
papers that have studied the problem in depth, but their conclusions are not rocket science.

04:34.560 --> 04:39.680
There's a pretty obvious pattern in why people are drawn into believing junk science videos and

04:39.680 --> 04:45.120
blogs. The trick is to shame them into thinking they're closed-minded and stupid if they just

04:45.120 --> 04:50.480
follow what they're taught by the government, i.e. science teachers, but smart and enlightened if

04:50.480 --> 04:56.000
they believe in a conspiracy that few people know about. You may have failed science at school,

04:56.000 --> 05:00.080
but now you're somebody. You're on equal terms with a Harvard professor.

05:00.800 --> 05:05.760
And use certain buzzwords that I've seen come up time and time again in discussions with

05:05.760 --> 05:12.000
conspiracy theorists on my channel. One of the most popular mantras is do your own research,

05:12.000 --> 05:16.800
which of course doesn't mean pick up a textbook and learn about the subject, it means google

05:16.800 --> 05:22.320
blogs that are easy to understand and echo your newfound beliefs, and blogs that are dressed up

05:22.320 --> 05:28.320
to look like peer-reviewed scientific papers. Oh yes, that paper. Well, the journal of eclectic

05:28.320 --> 05:34.560
science is a journal my evil twin brother made up. All it takes is a build your own webpage app.

05:34.560 --> 05:39.280
The journal also contains cutting edge research into spoon bending, and there's a paper showing

05:39.280 --> 05:44.640
that Elvis is alive. If you think that starting your own scientific journal to promote your

05:44.640 --> 05:50.720
beliefs is a bit far-fetched, well it's already been done. This impressive looking journal was

05:50.720 --> 05:56.080
started by two Irish brothers who submitted their own papers to themselves, peer reviewed

05:56.080 --> 06:01.360
their own papers, approved them without changes, and published them on their own blog, which they

06:01.360 --> 06:07.200
called Open Peer Review Journal. Now you might think, who in their right mind would fall for

06:07.200 --> 06:14.720
something like that? Well people do, and they're citing it. When I floated the idea that the

06:14.720 --> 06:20.400
internet might be seriously undermining real science back in 2011, I said this.

06:20.960 --> 06:25.600
When Cliff Clavin expounded his knowledge in the barroom at Cheers, he had an audience of less

06:25.600 --> 06:31.360
than a dozen people. These days, Cliffy would undoubtedly have his own website, and to disguise

06:31.360 --> 06:36.560
the fact that it's written by a mailman, he can make it anonymous, or he can give himself any

06:36.560 --> 06:42.240
title he likes, and claim a specialist background he doesn't have. That was eight years ago.

06:42.800 --> 06:47.600
In fact, I first mooted the idea more than five years earlier than that, at a time when people

06:47.600 --> 06:53.520
still knew who Cliff Clavin was. But back then, I still found it hard to believe that a useful

06:53.520 --> 06:58.720
tool like this newfangled internet could be responsible for undermining two hundred years

06:58.720 --> 07:04.880
of published science. Surely I thought normal, intelligent people wouldn't fall for this.

07:04.880 --> 07:09.760
We'd never have, say, a President of the United States gullible enough to believe whatever he

07:09.760 --> 07:20.960
sees on the internet. Look, it doesn't matter if this was a Republican or a Democratic President,

07:20.960 --> 07:24.720
we should all be concerned if our leaders are this easily misled.

07:25.520 --> 07:29.280
It's ironic that we now have a world of information at our fingertips.

07:29.280 --> 07:34.480
People can check any fact, from the mass of Jupiter to the chemical constituents of asparagus,

07:34.480 --> 07:39.200
without having to hunt through their local library. And yet the result has not been an

07:39.200 --> 07:45.280
increase in public knowledge, but a dumbing down. What are people learning? That evolution never

07:45.280 --> 07:50.880
happened. That putting crystals on your body draws out negative energy. And yes, this really

07:50.880 --> 07:58.720
is a growing belief that the Earth is flat. In April 2018, a YouGov poll found that 7%

07:58.720 --> 08:04.960
of Americans now think the Earth is or may be flat. That's 23 million people,

08:04.960 --> 08:10.240
in one of the best educated countries in the world. It's not often I agree with creationist

08:10.240 --> 08:15.680
Ray Comfort. In fact, I don't think I ever have. But he did manage to get this one right.

08:15.680 --> 08:21.120
If you're a Christian, and you believe that the Earth is flat, please keep it to yourself.

08:21.120 --> 08:26.720
Even if you have Bible verses that you think prove it, verses that are obviously metaphoric.

08:26.720 --> 08:32.160
This is because in many people's minds, you'll be perceived intellectually on the level of someone

08:32.160 --> 08:36.080
who thinks the moon is made of cheese. If they know you're a Christian,

08:36.080 --> 08:40.160
insisting that the Earth is flat won't exactly help your credibility.

08:40.160 --> 08:42.800
Yeah, I wouldn't want to make ourselves look stupid, right?

08:42.800 --> 08:45.680
Behold, the atheist's nightmare.

08:45.680 --> 08:50.800
But it's not Christians Ray has to worry about. Most of them have no problem with science.

08:50.800 --> 08:56.560
It's his fellow fundamentalists. According to the same YouGov poll, the more religious you are,

08:56.560 --> 09:01.280
the more likely you are to believe that the Earth is flat. That's not surprising,

09:01.280 --> 09:04.880
because people who are inclined to see a conspiracy in one field of science

09:04.880 --> 09:10.240
tend to believe in conspiracies everywhere. Tony Heller, whose blog is full of climate

09:10.240 --> 09:15.360
conspiracies, also gives vent to the idea that the Sandy Hook School massacre might have been

09:15.360 --> 09:20.080
a conspiracy, as well as the conspiracy theory that Obama was born in Kenya.

09:20.800 --> 09:25.600
The guy who made this video about a flat Earth also thinks NASA faked the moon landings.

09:26.320 --> 09:29.680
Once you start believing everyone's conspiring to hoax you,

09:29.680 --> 09:32.240
that means everyone's conspiring to hoax you.

09:32.880 --> 09:39.200
The fact is that all these conspiracy theories use exactly the same modus operandi. Cherrypick,

09:39.200 --> 09:44.080
misrepresent, misquote and invent a fictitious motive for the conspiracy,

09:44.080 --> 09:48.400
which is why it'll be so easy for you to build your own if you want to try it.

09:49.280 --> 09:55.440
The reason for this growing trend in conspiracies is best illustrated by the YouGov survey on flat

09:55.440 --> 10:00.800
Earth belief. The younger you are, the more likely you are to believe in a flat Earth.

10:00.800 --> 10:07.760
94% of people over 55 accept that the Earth is round. Only 66% of millennials do.

10:08.480 --> 10:12.880
And where do millennials get their information? No prizes for guessing.

10:12.880 --> 10:15.920
Don't just take my word for it. Look it up yourself.

10:15.920 --> 10:18.480
There it is again. Do your own research.

10:19.200 --> 10:23.600
Now, there's nothing wrong with that if you want to look up how the ancient Greeks worked

10:23.600 --> 10:29.280
out that the Earth was round over 2000 years ago and how it's been confirmed by every branch

10:29.280 --> 10:34.640
of physics since then. But of course these videos are aimed at people who aren't that much into

10:34.640 --> 10:39.600
science. They're not going to bother with textbooks and educational websites that contain

10:39.600 --> 10:44.000
complicated things like numbers. They'll google sites like this.

10:45.440 --> 10:50.000
After all, 5% of respondents say they used to believe the Earth was round,

10:50.000 --> 10:54.960
then as recommended they did their own research and came to the conclusion that there's some

10:54.960 --> 11:00.480
merit to the belief that the Earth is flat. So it's pretty obvious where they did their research.

11:01.600 --> 11:04.800
Google searches may not convince them that the Earth is flat,

11:04.800 --> 11:08.400
but it exposes them to enough bullcrap to sow a seed of doubt.

11:09.360 --> 11:14.080
That's all junk science needs. Once you believe scientists might be faking everything,

11:14.080 --> 11:18.960
you'll move quickly on to why, and that leads to the argument that they're doing it to get

11:18.960 --> 11:25.040
more research grant money. Why else? So let's see how this conspiracy works.

11:25.840 --> 11:30.160
In my geology class there was only one high achiever who went on to do a PhD.

11:30.720 --> 11:35.760
This isn't her by the way. The rest of us were just humdrum geology graduates who took up

11:35.760 --> 11:40.640
well-paid jobs in the oil industry because the intellectual demands aren't that great and the

11:40.640 --> 11:46.320
money is good. Most of my classmates went on to senior management roles in the oil industry

11:46.320 --> 11:52.480
where the pay got even better. Helen, the one who did the PhD, could have easily landed a similar

11:52.480 --> 11:58.640
job because she was the smart one. But she wasn't interested in an industry job. She was motivated

11:58.640 --> 12:03.920
by a burning interest in geology and a desire to make new discoveries and further the limits

12:03.920 --> 12:09.760
of scientific knowledge. Don't be surprised some people are just like that. The obsessive

12:09.760 --> 12:15.120
inquisitive nature of researchers is how science has advanced for the last 500 years.

12:16.080 --> 12:20.480
In the years after graduation Helen never mentioned that she'd been initiated into this

12:20.480 --> 12:26.880
secret worldwide conspiracy but here's how it must have gone. After Helen successfully applied for a

12:26.880 --> 12:31.600
grant to study carboniferous ocean environments her tutor would have broken the news to her.

12:32.160 --> 12:37.120
Sorry Helen but if you're going to find any evidence that's going to overturn accepted science

12:37.760 --> 12:42.160
in other words everything that's already been published you're not allowed to publish that

12:42.160 --> 12:46.000
you have to fake the data to cover it up but there will be money in it for you.

12:46.800 --> 12:50.960
Let's just imagine Helen didn't tell the tutor that this was an outrageous request

12:50.960 --> 12:55.040
but she's curious as to how anyone can profit from such a duplicitous scam.

12:55.600 --> 13:00.400
Her tutor would have told her you'll get grant money it will allow you to do more research

13:01.280 --> 13:06.800
and when Helen asks what's the point in doing more research if that entails simply faking more data

13:06.800 --> 13:12.400
and never coming up with any discoveries her tutor would have said no point at all your entire

13:12.400 --> 13:17.280
research career would be pointless you'll never stand out and your work will never be recognised

13:17.280 --> 13:23.360
or produce anything groundbreaking or original and you'll never benefit financially the only benefit

13:23.360 --> 13:28.720
that you get is to continue this charade until you retire without any self-respect and then die

13:29.280 --> 13:35.520
to which Helen must have said sounds like a plan to me and that's why she supposedly took up a

13:35.520 --> 13:42.080
poorly paid research job faking data all to get grants to do more data faking rather than simply

13:42.080 --> 13:48.640
move into a worthwhile and well-paid job in mining or oil exploration or dam construction and not

13:48.640 --> 13:54.000
only Helen agreed to this the same conversation happened with every PhD candidate involved in

13:54.000 --> 13:59.840
these controversial areas of science they joined a conspiracy that involves not only researchers

13:59.840 --> 14:05.840
but also journal editors Nobel Prize committee members everyone who works at geological surveys

14:05.840 --> 14:11.360
around the world the Royal Society the National Academy of Sciences and a host of other scientific

14:11.360 --> 14:16.880
institutes and presumably their spouses and partners apparently they're all in on it

14:18.320 --> 14:23.840
when I made my last video the story of the earth in 33 minutes I seem to have triggered all the

14:23.840 --> 14:29.440
various conspiracy theorists from creationists who didn't accept evolution to flat earthers who

14:29.440 --> 14:34.880
refused to accept that the world is round there were people who didn't accept plate tectonics

14:34.880 --> 14:40.720
or the role of co2 in climate change even people who believed Osama bin Laden was still alive

14:40.720 --> 14:45.920
or that he was a US government agent and bin laden was only in the video as part of an interesting

14:45.920 --> 14:52.720
story about geological unconformities the weirdest conspiracy theorists of the lot were those who saw

14:52.720 --> 14:59.120
a conspiracy in the fact that the video was 33 minutes long I had no idea what they were on about

14:59.120 --> 15:04.800
until I looked it up and apparently the number 33 has some sort of dark masonic connection

15:05.840 --> 15:11.600
well that's a bit awkward we can kiss goodbye to most scientific solutions if they're going to be

15:11.600 --> 15:18.320
put in a conspiracy basket whenever they use the number 33 remember my video was simply explaining

15:18.320 --> 15:24.320
what geology students learn at university there's nothing controversial about it but those who've

15:24.320 --> 15:29.280
decided some of this conflicts with their religious or ideological beliefs want the

15:29.280 --> 15:36.080
subject taught with those bits taken out well sorry science doesn't work that way it isn't a

15:36.080 --> 15:42.320
pick and mix all the disciplines within geology are interconnected every piece of evidence is

15:42.320 --> 15:49.040
related to and supports other pieces of evidence ignore one part and the rest makes no sense

15:49.040 --> 15:54.080
like pulling away the leg of a stool but if you're already convinced that scientists are

15:54.080 --> 15:59.760
conspiring to fake their research then it's obviously no good me trying to provide evidence

15:59.760 --> 16:04.640
because evidence comes from peer-reviewed studies and of course you'll just believe these are part

16:04.640 --> 16:10.320
of the conspiracy so I'll just say this peer-reviewed studies are the basis of all

16:10.320 --> 16:15.600
scientific research they're the basis of science textbooks they're the basis of everything science

16:15.600 --> 16:20.800
students learn at the university they're the basis of every piece of technology you use

16:20.800 --> 16:26.720
and the standard of living you now enjoy even if you didn't know it for example this paper by

16:26.720 --> 16:32.720
watson and crick and this paper by kerry mullis are the basis of dna analysis used for everything

16:32.720 --> 16:37.760
from catching murder suspects to breeding endangered animals and they're the basis of

16:37.760 --> 16:43.520
gmos that give you things like cheap breakfast cereals studies are the properties of cathode

16:43.520 --> 16:50.160
ray tubes in the early 20th century led to the development of television this paper was one of

16:50.160 --> 16:55.520
several landmark papers that established plate tectonic theory that's used to predict earthquake

16:55.520 --> 17:01.680
patterns and mitigate earthquake disasters even medical papers which are most frequently prone

17:01.680 --> 17:07.040
to errors because of the nature of the subject are still robust enough to make huge advances in

17:07.040 --> 17:12.480
treating illness and disease and peer-reviewed papers are still paving the way for technologies

17:12.480 --> 17:17.680
of the future and don't forget each of these landmark papers was dependent on hundreds of

17:17.680 --> 17:22.640
other peer-reviewed papers that went before them which the authors cited and the landmark

17:22.640 --> 17:28.000
papers themselves have been cited by hundreds of other papers that came afterwards and advanced

17:28.000 --> 17:33.680
our scientific knowledge even further so before you start rubbishing peer-reviewed papers that

17:33.680 --> 17:39.440
are the basis of science it's worth finding out how you've benefited from them and taking a leaf

17:39.440 --> 17:43.920
out of my own subject you're benefiting from the system of peer-reviewed scientific publishing

17:43.920 --> 17:50.000
every time you fill up your car knowing where to look for oil is no longer a matter of dumb luck

17:50.000 --> 17:55.440
it's dependent on understanding different rock types their stratigraphy their physical properties

17:55.440 --> 18:01.600
their faulting and folding patterns and their ages so the next time you find yourself musing

18:01.600 --> 18:07.600
about how peer-reviewed studies can't be trusted while you fill up your car with gasoline and mutter

18:07.600 --> 18:12.960
that the best way to advance science is by sitting around a table giving persuasive arguments

18:12.960 --> 18:18.080
try instead to spend those 60 seconds thinking about where the knowledge to find that gasoline

18:18.080 --> 18:23.440
came from and give thanks to the geologists who used it to find not only your gasoline

18:23.440 --> 18:29.680
but also the minerals that make up your car you're welcome but if you still think that

18:29.680 --> 18:34.400
geology is nothing more than a huge conspiracy or just the link between earthquakes and plate

18:34.400 --> 18:40.640
tectonics or the link between plate tectonics and co2 or the link between co2 and climate or the

18:40.640 --> 18:45.680
link between climate and evolution or the link between evolution and plate tectonics if you think

18:45.680 --> 18:50.480
any of these connections is a hoax then there's no point in teaching any geology to the next

18:50.480 --> 18:57.040
generation of geologists because without each link the whole discipline falls apart so you might as

18:57.040 --> 19:02.160
well fire the mineralogists and the well loggers and replace them with bloggers and youtube video

19:02.160 --> 19:07.760
makers who thought up their own science through persuasive argument just go with what's on the

19:07.760 --> 19:13.680
internet abolish universities stop all the research burn all the textbooks stop pumping

19:13.680 --> 19:20.000
the gasoline abandon your car made of metal and walk back to the 14th century

19:22.320 --> 19:27.520
thanks again to all those who are supporting this channel by donating to my favorite charity

19:27.520 --> 19:32.560
i'm delighted to pass on an email i got from them saying that donations from my subscribers

19:32.560 --> 19:40.800
have now reached 63 000 and one very generous donor gave 18 000 which is mind-blowing this has

19:40.800 --> 19:45.600
allowed the model of providing health care in exchange for reforestation to spread to other

19:45.600 --> 19:52.240
parts of the world like brazil and madagascar and here's some important news until december 31st

19:52.240 --> 19:57.760
all contributions will be matched by a generous outside donor so anything you give between now

19:57.760 --> 20:03.600
and the new year will be doubled if you don't know what this charity is or what it does please take

20:03.600 --> 20:08.560
a look in the video description because it really is groundbreaking and i've been to borneo to see

20:08.560 --> 20:13.680
the work they do for myself even if you're a conspiracy theorist and you've come to this

20:13.680 --> 20:19.440
channel just to promote your pet conspiracy you're doing that for free so why not give a few bucks to

20:19.440 --> 20:24.880
charity for the privilege if they had a penny for every conspiracy that's out there they'd already

20:24.880 --> 20:28.480
be fully funded
