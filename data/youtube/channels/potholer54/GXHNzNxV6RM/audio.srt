1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,040
I'm sure you've all heard the expression, the moon is made of cheese.

2
00:00:03,680 --> 00:00:07,920
Understandable because the moon does look a bit like a big round cheese,

3
00:00:07,920 --> 00:00:12,080
but in fact the correct expression is, the moon is made of green cheese,

4
00:00:12,080 --> 00:00:16,640
and the first written record of it comes from John Heywood in the 16th century,

5
00:00:16,640 --> 00:00:21,360
as part of a collection of old sayings. But of course the moon isn't green, so

6
00:00:21,360 --> 00:00:25,760
where does this idea come from? Is it possible the original saying,

7
00:00:25,760 --> 00:00:30,640
going back centuries before Heywood, was that the moon is made of cream cheese,

8
00:00:30,640 --> 00:00:33,840
and ancient beliefs are often based on a kernel of truth?

9
00:00:34,800 --> 00:00:38,560
Cream cheese is a carbon-based compound made of elements that are commonly found

10
00:00:38,560 --> 00:00:42,480
throughout the universe. This is what it looks like under a microscope.

11
00:00:43,040 --> 00:00:46,960
So is it possible that a similar compound does exist on the moon?

12
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:53,040
We know that cheese is formed when proteins break down into peptides and then amino acids,

13
00:00:53,040 --> 00:00:57,520
and finally into carboxylic acids through a process called liposilis.

14
00:00:58,240 --> 00:01:01,840
Now you might think, surely you can't get proteins on the moon,

15
00:01:01,840 --> 00:01:07,040
they're complex organic chemicals. Yes they are, but amino acids are not,

16
00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:12,800
and we know that amino acids are present on the moon because they've been found in meteorites.

17
00:01:13,360 --> 00:01:19,040
So there's no reason why the same chemical process that turns amino acids into carboxylic acids on

18
00:01:19,040 --> 00:01:23,680
Earth couldn't happen on the moon. But is there any evidence for it?

19
00:01:24,400 --> 00:01:28,640
When Apollo astronauts came back from the moon, NASA announced that the samples they

20
00:01:28,640 --> 00:01:32,880
brought with them were volcanic rock, and they said maybe we could mine the moon for

21
00:01:32,880 --> 00:01:37,680
valuable minerals. And because everyone trusts NASA, no one questioned it.

22
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:44,800
But I'd urge you to check for yourselves. This is what moon rock looks like under a microscope.

23
00:01:44,800 --> 00:01:49,840
NASA claims it's volcanic, but here's rock from the Earth that we know is volcanic,

24
00:01:49,840 --> 00:01:53,760
and it looks nothing like the supposedly volcanic rock they found on the moon.

25
00:01:54,560 --> 00:01:57,840
So what does it look like? Well let's go back to that

26
00:01:57,840 --> 00:02:02,640
microscopic image of cream cheese that we saw earlier. Notice any similarity?

27
00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:09,600
But why, you might ask, would NASA want to fake all this? Well just follow the money. Here's

28
00:02:09,600 --> 00:02:15,040
NASA's budget as a percentage of the federal budget over the last 60 years. You'd have to

29
00:02:15,040 --> 00:02:19,600
be blind not to see that their most profitable years were when they were sending rockets to

30
00:02:19,600 --> 00:02:24,800
the moon. As long as they can keep up the pretence that there are valuable minerals there, they can

31
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:29,840
ask for billions of dollars in funding. But the movement to expose NASA's fraud

32
00:02:29,840 --> 00:02:34,480
is growing. There's currently a debate over this issue in the scientific community,

33
00:02:34,480 --> 00:02:39,280
so you need to keep an open mind and listen to both sides of the argument.

34
00:02:39,280 --> 00:02:43,760
There was a huge controversy earlier this year when a peer-reviewed paper was published

35
00:02:43,760 --> 00:02:49,120
providing more evidence that the moon is made of cheese. The reason you haven't heard about this

36
00:02:49,120 --> 00:02:54,560
is because as soon as the paper was published, the author was fired from his job stacking boxes

37
00:02:54,560 --> 00:02:59,920
at a Walmart superstore, ostensibly because he forgot to refrigerate a carton of blueberry

38
00:02:59,920 --> 00:03:05,840
swirl ice cream. But the real reason is that he dared to go against the scientific consensus.

39
00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:11,360
Not only that, everyone who's read the paper mysteriously disappeared

40
00:03:11,360 --> 00:03:15,680
or ended up dead in a dumpster. The only conclusion we can draw-

41
00:03:15,680 --> 00:03:16,180
NO!

42
00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:24,080
I apologise for that rant by my evil twin brother, but he was going a bit too far with this

43
00:03:24,080 --> 00:03:29,440
conspiracy. Just in case anyone was beginning to doubt it, the moon isn't made of cheese,

44
00:03:29,440 --> 00:03:33,920
but I suppose some people will already be sufficiently convinced that they'll just assume

45
00:03:34,160 --> 00:03:39,280
I'm part of the conspiracy to cover that up. After all, people are prepared to believe videos

46
00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:44,640
that claim the Earth is expanding. If I'd made up something mildly less absurd, like

47
00:03:44,640 --> 00:03:49,600
the moon is going to crash into the Earth, it would be very easy to dazzle gullible people

48
00:03:49,600 --> 00:03:55,280
with lots of numbers and diagrams and convince them of anything. Don't just take my word for it,

49
00:03:55,280 --> 00:04:01,200
try it yourselves. Think up the most outlandish conspiracy you can, in other words a conspiracy

50
00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:07,120
of scientists to fake data to cover up what you think is the truth, and build on it. Don't just

51
00:04:07,120 --> 00:04:12,880
make stuff up out of thin air, do what real conspiracy theorists do, make it plausible.

52
00:04:12,880 --> 00:04:16,800
Cherry pick some real facts, just make sure you draw the wrong conclusions.

53
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:23,440
It's surprisingly easy and actually quite fun. So in this video I'm going to look at why people

54
00:04:23,440 --> 00:04:29,440
trust blogs and videos like these more than science textbooks. Of course there are psychology

55
00:04:29,440 --> 00:04:34,560
papers that have studied the problem in depth, but their conclusions are not rocket science.

56
00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:39,680
There's a pretty obvious pattern in why people are drawn into believing junk science videos and

57
00:04:39,680 --> 00:04:45,120
blogs. The trick is to shame them into thinking they're closed-minded and stupid if they just

58
00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:50,480
follow what they're taught by the government, i.e. science teachers, but smart and enlightened if

59
00:04:50,480 --> 00:04:56,000
they believe in a conspiracy that few people know about. You may have failed science at school,

60
00:04:56,000 --> 00:05:00,080
but now you're somebody. You're on equal terms with a Harvard professor.

61
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:05,760
And use certain buzzwords that I've seen come up time and time again in discussions with

62
00:05:05,760 --> 00:05:12,000
conspiracy theorists on my channel. One of the most popular mantras is do your own research,

63
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:16,800
which of course doesn't mean pick up a textbook and learn about the subject, it means google

64
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:22,320
blogs that are easy to understand and echo your newfound beliefs, and blogs that are dressed up

65
00:05:22,320 --> 00:05:28,320
to look like peer-reviewed scientific papers. Oh yes, that paper. Well, the journal of eclectic

66
00:05:28,320 --> 00:05:34,560
science is a journal my evil twin brother made up. All it takes is a build your own webpage app.

67
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:39,280
The journal also contains cutting edge research into spoon bending, and there's a paper showing

68
00:05:39,280 --> 00:05:44,640
that Elvis is alive. If you think that starting your own scientific journal to promote your

69
00:05:44,640 --> 00:05:50,720
beliefs is a bit far-fetched, well it's already been done. This impressive looking journal was

70
00:05:50,720 --> 00:05:56,080
started by two Irish brothers who submitted their own papers to themselves, peer reviewed

71
00:05:56,080 --> 00:06:01,360
their own papers, approved them without changes, and published them on their own blog, which they

72
00:06:01,360 --> 00:06:07,200
called Open Peer Review Journal. Now you might think, who in their right mind would fall for

73
00:06:07,200 --> 00:06:14,720
something like that? Well people do, and they're citing it. When I floated the idea that the

74
00:06:14,720 --> 00:06:20,400
internet might be seriously undermining real science back in 2011, I said this.

75
00:06:20,960 --> 00:06:25,600
When Cliff Clavin expounded his knowledge in the barroom at Cheers, he had an audience of less

76
00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:31,360
than a dozen people. These days, Cliffy would undoubtedly have his own website, and to disguise

77
00:06:31,360 --> 00:06:36,560
the fact that it's written by a mailman, he can make it anonymous, or he can give himself any

78
00:06:36,560 --> 00:06:42,240
title he likes, and claim a specialist background he doesn't have. That was eight years ago.

79
00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:47,600
In fact, I first mooted the idea more than five years earlier than that, at a time when people

80
00:06:47,600 --> 00:06:53,520
still knew who Cliff Clavin was. But back then, I still found it hard to believe that a useful

81
00:06:53,520 --> 00:06:58,720
tool like this newfangled internet could be responsible for undermining two hundred years

82
00:06:58,720 --> 00:07:04,880
of published science. Surely I thought normal, intelligent people wouldn't fall for this.

83
00:07:04,880 --> 00:07:09,760
We'd never have, say, a President of the United States gullible enough to believe whatever he

84
00:07:09,760 --> 00:07:20,960
sees on the internet. Look, it doesn't matter if this was a Republican or a Democratic President,

85
00:07:20,960 --> 00:07:24,720
we should all be concerned if our leaders are this easily misled.

86
00:07:25,520 --> 00:07:29,280
It's ironic that we now have a world of information at our fingertips.

87
00:07:29,280 --> 00:07:34,480
People can check any fact, from the mass of Jupiter to the chemical constituents of asparagus,

88
00:07:34,480 --> 00:07:39,200
without having to hunt through their local library. And yet the result has not been an

89
00:07:39,200 --> 00:07:45,280
increase in public knowledge, but a dumbing down. What are people learning? That evolution never

90
00:07:45,280 --> 00:07:50,880
happened. That putting crystals on your body draws out negative energy. And yes, this really

91
00:07:50,880 --> 00:07:58,720
is a growing belief that the Earth is flat. In April 2018, a YouGov poll found that 7%

92
00:07:58,720 --> 00:08:04,960
of Americans now think the Earth is or may be flat. That's 23 million people,

93
00:08:04,960 --> 00:08:10,240
in one of the best educated countries in the world. It's not often I agree with creationist

94
00:08:10,240 --> 00:08:15,680
Ray Comfort. In fact, I don't think I ever have. But he did manage to get this one right.

95
00:08:15,680 --> 00:08:21,120
If you're a Christian, and you believe that the Earth is flat, please keep it to yourself.

96
00:08:21,120 --> 00:08:26,720
Even if you have Bible verses that you think prove it, verses that are obviously metaphoric.

97
00:08:26,720 --> 00:08:32,160
This is because in many people's minds, you'll be perceived intellectually on the level of someone

98
00:08:32,160 --> 00:08:36,080
who thinks the moon is made of cheese. If they know you're a Christian,

99
00:08:36,080 --> 00:08:40,160
insisting that the Earth is flat won't exactly help your credibility.

100
00:08:40,160 --> 00:08:42,800
Yeah, I wouldn't want to make ourselves look stupid, right?

101
00:08:42,800 --> 00:08:45,680
Behold, the atheist's nightmare.

102
00:08:45,680 --> 00:08:50,800
But it's not Christians Ray has to worry about. Most of them have no problem with science.

103
00:08:50,800 --> 00:08:56,560
It's his fellow fundamentalists. According to the same YouGov poll, the more religious you are,

104
00:08:56,560 --> 00:09:01,280
the more likely you are to believe that the Earth is flat. That's not surprising,

105
00:09:01,280 --> 00:09:04,880
because people who are inclined to see a conspiracy in one field of science

106
00:09:04,880 --> 00:09:10,240
tend to believe in conspiracies everywhere. Tony Heller, whose blog is full of climate

107
00:09:10,240 --> 00:09:15,360
conspiracies, also gives vent to the idea that the Sandy Hook School massacre might have been

108
00:09:15,360 --> 00:09:20,080
a conspiracy, as well as the conspiracy theory that Obama was born in Kenya.

109
00:09:20,800 --> 00:09:25,600
The guy who made this video about a flat Earth also thinks NASA faked the moon landings.

110
00:09:26,320 --> 00:09:29,680
Once you start believing everyone's conspiring to hoax you,

111
00:09:29,680 --> 00:09:32,240
that means everyone's conspiring to hoax you.

112
00:09:32,880 --> 00:09:39,200
The fact is that all these conspiracy theories use exactly the same modus operandi. Cherrypick,

113
00:09:39,200 --> 00:09:44,080
misrepresent, misquote and invent a fictitious motive for the conspiracy,

114
00:09:44,080 --> 00:09:48,400
which is why it'll be so easy for you to build your own if you want to try it.

115
00:09:49,280 --> 00:09:55,440
The reason for this growing trend in conspiracies is best illustrated by the YouGov survey on flat

116
00:09:55,440 --> 00:10:00,800
Earth belief. The younger you are, the more likely you are to believe in a flat Earth.

117
00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:07,760
94% of people over 55 accept that the Earth is round. Only 66% of millennials do.

118
00:10:08,480 --> 00:10:12,880
And where do millennials get their information? No prizes for guessing.

119
00:10:12,880 --> 00:10:15,920
Don't just take my word for it. Look it up yourself.

120
00:10:15,920 --> 00:10:18,480
There it is again. Do your own research.

121
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:23,600
Now, there's nothing wrong with that if you want to look up how the ancient Greeks worked

122
00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:29,280
out that the Earth was round over 2000 years ago and how it's been confirmed by every branch

123
00:10:29,280 --> 00:10:34,640
of physics since then. But of course these videos are aimed at people who aren't that much into

124
00:10:34,640 --> 00:10:39,600
science. They're not going to bother with textbooks and educational websites that contain

125
00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:44,000
complicated things like numbers. They'll google sites like this.

126
00:10:45,440 --> 00:10:50,000
After all, 5% of respondents say they used to believe the Earth was round,

127
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:54,960
then as recommended they did their own research and came to the conclusion that there's some

128
00:10:54,960 --> 00:11:00,480
merit to the belief that the Earth is flat. So it's pretty obvious where they did their research.

129
00:11:01,600 --> 00:11:04,800
Google searches may not convince them that the Earth is flat,

130
00:11:04,800 --> 00:11:08,400
but it exposes them to enough bullcrap to sow a seed of doubt.

131
00:11:09,360 --> 00:11:14,080
That's all junk science needs. Once you believe scientists might be faking everything,

132
00:11:14,080 --> 00:11:18,960
you'll move quickly on to why, and that leads to the argument that they're doing it to get

133
00:11:18,960 --> 00:11:25,040
more research grant money. Why else? So let's see how this conspiracy works.

134
00:11:25,840 --> 00:11:30,160
In my geology class there was only one high achiever who went on to do a PhD.

135
00:11:30,720 --> 00:11:35,760
This isn't her by the way. The rest of us were just humdrum geology graduates who took up

136
00:11:35,760 --> 00:11:40,640
well-paid jobs in the oil industry because the intellectual demands aren't that great and the

137
00:11:40,640 --> 00:11:46,320
money is good. Most of my classmates went on to senior management roles in the oil industry

138
00:11:46,320 --> 00:11:52,480
where the pay got even better. Helen, the one who did the PhD, could have easily landed a similar

139
00:11:52,480 --> 00:11:58,640
job because she was the smart one. But she wasn't interested in an industry job. She was motivated

140
00:11:58,640 --> 00:12:03,920
by a burning interest in geology and a desire to make new discoveries and further the limits

141
00:12:03,920 --> 00:12:09,760
of scientific knowledge. Don't be surprised some people are just like that. The obsessive

142
00:12:09,760 --> 00:12:15,120
inquisitive nature of researchers is how science has advanced for the last 500 years.

143
00:12:16,080 --> 00:12:20,480
In the years after graduation Helen never mentioned that she'd been initiated into this

144
00:12:20,480 --> 00:12:26,880
secret worldwide conspiracy but here's how it must have gone. After Helen successfully applied for a

145
00:12:26,880 --> 00:12:31,600
grant to study carboniferous ocean environments her tutor would have broken the news to her.

146
00:12:32,160 --> 00:12:37,120
Sorry Helen but if you're going to find any evidence that's going to overturn accepted science

147
00:12:37,760 --> 00:12:42,160
in other words everything that's already been published you're not allowed to publish that

148
00:12:42,160 --> 00:12:46,000
you have to fake the data to cover it up but there will be money in it for you.

149
00:12:46,800 --> 00:12:50,960
Let's just imagine Helen didn't tell the tutor that this was an outrageous request

150
00:12:50,960 --> 00:12:55,040
but she's curious as to how anyone can profit from such a duplicitous scam.

151
00:12:55,600 --> 00:13:00,400
Her tutor would have told her you'll get grant money it will allow you to do more research

152
00:13:01,280 --> 00:13:06,800
and when Helen asks what's the point in doing more research if that entails simply faking more data

153
00:13:06,800 --> 00:13:12,400
and never coming up with any discoveries her tutor would have said no point at all your entire

154
00:13:12,400 --> 00:13:17,280
research career would be pointless you'll never stand out and your work will never be recognised

155
00:13:17,280 --> 00:13:23,360
or produce anything groundbreaking or original and you'll never benefit financially the only benefit

156
00:13:23,360 --> 00:13:28,720
that you get is to continue this charade until you retire without any self-respect and then die

157
00:13:29,280 --> 00:13:35,520
to which Helen must have said sounds like a plan to me and that's why she supposedly took up a

158
00:13:35,520 --> 00:13:42,080
poorly paid research job faking data all to get grants to do more data faking rather than simply

159
00:13:42,080 --> 00:13:48,640
move into a worthwhile and well-paid job in mining or oil exploration or dam construction and not

160
00:13:48,640 --> 00:13:54,000
only Helen agreed to this the same conversation happened with every PhD candidate involved in

161
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:59,840
these controversial areas of science they joined a conspiracy that involves not only researchers

162
00:13:59,840 --> 00:14:05,840
but also journal editors Nobel Prize committee members everyone who works at geological surveys

163
00:14:05,840 --> 00:14:11,360
around the world the Royal Society the National Academy of Sciences and a host of other scientific

164
00:14:11,360 --> 00:14:16,880
institutes and presumably their spouses and partners apparently they're all in on it

165
00:14:18,320 --> 00:14:23,840
when I made my last video the story of the earth in 33 minutes I seem to have triggered all the

166
00:14:23,840 --> 00:14:29,440
various conspiracy theorists from creationists who didn't accept evolution to flat earthers who

167
00:14:29,440 --> 00:14:34,880
refused to accept that the world is round there were people who didn't accept plate tectonics

168
00:14:34,880 --> 00:14:40,720
or the role of co2 in climate change even people who believed Osama bin Laden was still alive

169
00:14:40,720 --> 00:14:45,920
or that he was a US government agent and bin laden was only in the video as part of an interesting

170
00:14:45,920 --> 00:14:52,720
story about geological unconformities the weirdest conspiracy theorists of the lot were those who saw

171
00:14:52,720 --> 00:14:59,120
a conspiracy in the fact that the video was 33 minutes long I had no idea what they were on about

172
00:14:59,120 --> 00:15:04,800
until I looked it up and apparently the number 33 has some sort of dark masonic connection

173
00:15:05,840 --> 00:15:11,600
well that's a bit awkward we can kiss goodbye to most scientific solutions if they're going to be

174
00:15:11,600 --> 00:15:18,320
put in a conspiracy basket whenever they use the number 33 remember my video was simply explaining

175
00:15:18,320 --> 00:15:24,320
what geology students learn at university there's nothing controversial about it but those who've

176
00:15:24,320 --> 00:15:29,280
decided some of this conflicts with their religious or ideological beliefs want the

177
00:15:29,280 --> 00:15:36,080
subject taught with those bits taken out well sorry science doesn't work that way it isn't a

178
00:15:36,080 --> 00:15:42,320
pick and mix all the disciplines within geology are interconnected every piece of evidence is

179
00:15:42,320 --> 00:15:49,040
related to and supports other pieces of evidence ignore one part and the rest makes no sense

180
00:15:49,040 --> 00:15:54,080
like pulling away the leg of a stool but if you're already convinced that scientists are

181
00:15:54,080 --> 00:15:59,760
conspiring to fake their research then it's obviously no good me trying to provide evidence

182
00:15:59,760 --> 00:16:04,640
because evidence comes from peer-reviewed studies and of course you'll just believe these are part

183
00:16:04,640 --> 00:16:10,320
of the conspiracy so I'll just say this peer-reviewed studies are the basis of all

184
00:16:10,320 --> 00:16:15,600
scientific research they're the basis of science textbooks they're the basis of everything science

185
00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:20,800
students learn at the university they're the basis of every piece of technology you use

186
00:16:20,800 --> 00:16:26,720
and the standard of living you now enjoy even if you didn't know it for example this paper by

187
00:16:26,720 --> 00:16:32,720
watson and crick and this paper by kerry mullis are the basis of dna analysis used for everything

188
00:16:32,720 --> 00:16:37,760
from catching murder suspects to breeding endangered animals and they're the basis of

189
00:16:37,760 --> 00:16:43,520
gmos that give you things like cheap breakfast cereals studies are the properties of cathode

190
00:16:43,520 --> 00:16:50,160
ray tubes in the early 20th century led to the development of television this paper was one of

191
00:16:50,160 --> 00:16:55,520
several landmark papers that established plate tectonic theory that's used to predict earthquake

192
00:16:55,520 --> 00:17:01,680
patterns and mitigate earthquake disasters even medical papers which are most frequently prone

193
00:17:01,680 --> 00:17:07,040
to errors because of the nature of the subject are still robust enough to make huge advances in

194
00:17:07,040 --> 00:17:12,480
treating illness and disease and peer-reviewed papers are still paving the way for technologies

195
00:17:12,480 --> 00:17:17,680
of the future and don't forget each of these landmark papers was dependent on hundreds of

196
00:17:17,680 --> 00:17:22,640
other peer-reviewed papers that went before them which the authors cited and the landmark

197
00:17:22,640 --> 00:17:28,000
papers themselves have been cited by hundreds of other papers that came afterwards and advanced

198
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:33,680
our scientific knowledge even further so before you start rubbishing peer-reviewed papers that

199
00:17:33,680 --> 00:17:39,440
are the basis of science it's worth finding out how you've benefited from them and taking a leaf

200
00:17:39,440 --> 00:17:43,920
out of my own subject you're benefiting from the system of peer-reviewed scientific publishing

201
00:17:43,920 --> 00:17:50,000
every time you fill up your car knowing where to look for oil is no longer a matter of dumb luck

202
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:55,440
it's dependent on understanding different rock types their stratigraphy their physical properties

203
00:17:55,440 --> 00:18:01,600
their faulting and folding patterns and their ages so the next time you find yourself musing

204
00:18:01,600 --> 00:18:07,600
about how peer-reviewed studies can't be trusted while you fill up your car with gasoline and mutter

205
00:18:07,600 --> 00:18:12,960
that the best way to advance science is by sitting around a table giving persuasive arguments

206
00:18:12,960 --> 00:18:18,080
try instead to spend those 60 seconds thinking about where the knowledge to find that gasoline

207
00:18:18,080 --> 00:18:23,440
came from and give thanks to the geologists who used it to find not only your gasoline

208
00:18:23,440 --> 00:18:29,680
but also the minerals that make up your car you're welcome but if you still think that

209
00:18:29,680 --> 00:18:34,400
geology is nothing more than a huge conspiracy or just the link between earthquakes and plate

210
00:18:34,400 --> 00:18:40,640
tectonics or the link between plate tectonics and co2 or the link between co2 and climate or the

211
00:18:40,640 --> 00:18:45,680
link between climate and evolution or the link between evolution and plate tectonics if you think

212
00:18:45,680 --> 00:18:50,480
any of these connections is a hoax then there's no point in teaching any geology to the next

213
00:18:50,480 --> 00:18:57,040
generation of geologists because without each link the whole discipline falls apart so you might as

214
00:18:57,040 --> 00:19:02,160
well fire the mineralogists and the well loggers and replace them with bloggers and youtube video

215
00:19:02,160 --> 00:19:07,760
makers who thought up their own science through persuasive argument just go with what's on the

216
00:19:07,760 --> 00:19:13,680
internet abolish universities stop all the research burn all the textbooks stop pumping

217
00:19:13,680 --> 00:19:20,000
the gasoline abandon your car made of metal and walk back to the 14th century

218
00:19:22,320 --> 00:19:27,520
thanks again to all those who are supporting this channel by donating to my favorite charity

219
00:19:27,520 --> 00:19:32,560
i'm delighted to pass on an email i got from them saying that donations from my subscribers

220
00:19:32,560 --> 00:19:40,800
have now reached 63 000 and one very generous donor gave 18 000 which is mind-blowing this has

221
00:19:40,800 --> 00:19:45,600
allowed the model of providing health care in exchange for reforestation to spread to other

222
00:19:45,600 --> 00:19:52,240
parts of the world like brazil and madagascar and here's some important news until december 31st

223
00:19:52,240 --> 00:19:57,760
all contributions will be matched by a generous outside donor so anything you give between now

224
00:19:57,760 --> 00:20:03,600
and the new year will be doubled if you don't know what this charity is or what it does please take

225
00:20:03,600 --> 00:20:08,560
a look in the video description because it really is groundbreaking and i've been to borneo to see

226
00:20:08,560 --> 00:20:13,680
the work they do for myself even if you're a conspiracy theorist and you've come to this

227
00:20:13,680 --> 00:20:19,440
channel just to promote your pet conspiracy you're doing that for free so why not give a few bucks to

228
00:20:19,440 --> 00:20:24,880
charity for the privilege if they had a penny for every conspiracy that's out there they'd already

229
00:20:24,880 --> 00:20:28,480
be fully funded
