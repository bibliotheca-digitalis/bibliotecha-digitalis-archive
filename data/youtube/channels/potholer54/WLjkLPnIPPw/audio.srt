00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,680
My thanks to Tony Heller for checking my channel for accuracy

2
00:00:03,680 --> 00:00:08,560
in his video Debunking the Debunker. A lot of people ask me to respond,

3
00:00:08,560 --> 00:00:13,760
so I'm happy to do so. I'll go through his claims in chronological order.

4
00:00:13,760 --> 00:00:18,800
Here's the first one. He claims that a tiny bit of cooling triggers ice ages

5
00:00:18,800 --> 00:00:23,440
and a tiny bit of warming ends them. Well the researchers I cite conclude this,

6
00:00:23,440 --> 00:00:27,280
not me. But he doesn't provide any evidence of the magnitude of these

7
00:00:27,280 --> 00:00:31,920
changes. Actually I do. I not only give the figures, I cite and

8
00:00:31,920 --> 00:00:37,040
show the study they came from. This is from my video Does CO2 Lead or

9
00:00:37,040 --> 00:00:40,960
Lag Global Warming? A paper by Lorius et al shows that

10
00:00:40,960 --> 00:00:44,880
insulation has varied by only 0.7 watts per square meter

11
00:00:44,880 --> 00:00:50,080
over the last 160,000 years. In other words, the tiny amount of forcing due to

12
00:00:50,080 --> 00:00:53,600
the Earth's orbit wasn't enough to defrost miles of thick

13
00:00:53,600 --> 00:00:59,360
ice covering a large part of the planet. Listen carefully to what he says here.

14
00:00:59,360 --> 00:01:03,200
But each time something had to act as that initial trigger.

15
00:01:03,200 --> 00:01:06,880
Something had to nudge the round weight just a fraction.

16
00:01:06,880 --> 00:01:10,640
A strong contender has always been regular cyclical deviation in the Earth's

17
00:01:10,640 --> 00:01:13,600
position or orbit, changing the amount of sunlight the

18
00:01:13,600 --> 00:01:17,280
Earth received. Whatever it was, in the depths of the ice

19
00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:20,240
age this change melted a tiny part of the ice sheet

20
00:01:20,320 --> 00:01:24,080
and released carbon gases from the soil and from the warmer oceans.

21
00:01:24,080 --> 00:01:28,720
Whatever it was, he doesn't actually know what the trigger of the ice ages is, but

22
00:01:28,720 --> 00:01:31,600
he claims to know that the magnitude of it is small.

23
00:01:31,600 --> 00:01:34,960
But didn't I just explain what researchers think it was?

24
00:01:34,960 --> 00:01:38,800
Tony even played the clip. A strong contender has always been regular

25
00:01:38,800 --> 00:01:41,920
cyclical deviation in the Earth's position or orbit,

26
00:01:41,920 --> 00:01:46,080
changing the amount of sunlight the Earth received. These orbital movements

27
00:01:46,080 --> 00:01:48,800
and wobbles are called Milankovitch cycles.

28
00:01:48,800 --> 00:01:53,520
In another video I explain that again. Researchers say carbon dioxide was not

29
00:01:53,520 --> 00:01:57,760
the cause of the initial warming during any of the recent deglaciations.

30
00:01:57,760 --> 00:02:00,960
The most likely trigger was the Milankovitch cycles,

31
00:02:00,960 --> 00:02:05,200
changes in the Earth's tilt and orbit that caused more insulation.

32
00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:08,640
What if the effect of those orbital cycles was actually very large?

33
00:02:08,640 --> 00:02:12,800
Then his entire theory goes down the drain immediately. But as I point out,

34
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:16,080
researchers have calculated that they aren't large.

35
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:20,400
And again, it's not my theory. Professional researchers know very

36
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:23,680
precisely what these orbital variations are,

37
00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:27,040
and they can calculate within given margins of error

38
00:02:27,040 --> 00:02:30,480
how much they affect the energy budget of the Earth.

39
00:02:30,480 --> 00:02:34,400
Of course, Tony can speculate that it's much bigger or much smaller.

40
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:39,280
He's free to imagine any figures he likes. But researchers can't do that.

41
00:02:39,280 --> 00:02:42,880
They have to go with what the measurements and calculations show.

42
00:02:42,880 --> 00:02:46,240
And as a science reporter, I can't do that either.

43
00:02:46,240 --> 00:02:49,440
I have to accurately report their results.

44
00:02:49,440 --> 00:02:52,800
Tony goes on to describe how a small amount of warming

45
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:57,520
causes oceans to release CO2, since carbon dioxide is less soluble at

46
00:02:57,520 --> 00:03:02,400
higher water temperature. I explain exactly the same thing, so no

47
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:05,840
argument there. So the relationship here, as Potholler

48
00:03:05,840 --> 00:03:09,600
correctly stated, is that CO2 follows temperature.

49
00:03:09,680 --> 00:03:13,840
Temperature changes first, and the CO2 changes later.

50
00:03:13,840 --> 00:03:18,400
What he blew over in his discussion was that Al Gore said the exact opposite.

51
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:21,680
He tried to make it sound like CO2 drove the temperature.

52
00:03:21,680 --> 00:03:25,680
He did indeed, and I pointed out his mistake very clearly.

53
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:29,920
In his film An Inconvenient Truth, Al Gore used a graph like this to show a

54
00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:32,400
correlation between carbon dioxide levels

55
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:36,160
and increased temperatures. But he obscured the fact that the carbon

56
00:03:36,160 --> 00:03:40,160
dioxide increases lag the temperature increases by 800

57
00:03:40,160 --> 00:03:43,520
years. So I didn't blow over this at all. It's

58
00:03:43,520 --> 00:03:46,240
right there. Billions of school children around the

59
00:03:46,240 --> 00:03:50,560
world have been lied to about this topic, and Potholler didn't seem to think that

60
00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:54,640
was very important. Now that's a bit unfair. I think that's

61
00:03:54,640 --> 00:03:57,840
extremely important, and if you'd asked me, Tony, I would have

62
00:03:57,840 --> 00:04:01,840
been very happy to tell you that. I've made no indication in any of my

63
00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:05,680
videos that I'm not concerned about children being misinformed about

64
00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:08,880
science, whether it's by Al Gore or Laurie David

65
00:04:08,880 --> 00:04:12,560
or anyone else. I've frequently spoken out in my videos

66
00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:16,320
about the need to stop junk science creeping into classrooms,

67
00:04:16,320 --> 00:04:20,960
and I'm happy to repeat that now. I've also said schools need to spend more

68
00:04:20,960 --> 00:04:24,400
time teaching children how to tell the difference between real

69
00:04:24,400 --> 00:04:29,920
science and junk science on the internet. But let's just get back to what Tony

70
00:04:29,920 --> 00:04:34,080
claims I agree with. So the relationship here, as Potholler

71
00:04:34,080 --> 00:04:37,840
correctly stated, is that CO2 follows temperature.

72
00:04:37,840 --> 00:04:41,600
Temperature changes first, and the CO2 changes later.

73
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:45,680
Well I didn't say the relationship here is that CO2 follows temperature,

74
00:04:45,680 --> 00:04:50,160
obviously, because this is a graph covering several glacial cycles.

75
00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:54,000
What I said was that CO2 followed temperatures in the early stages of

76
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:57,520
deglaciation in the southern hemisphere, because I'm

77
00:04:57,520 --> 00:05:00,400
reporting the conclusion of scientific studies.

78
00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:03,920
In the latter stages of deglaciation shown on the graph,

79
00:05:03,920 --> 00:05:08,160
and in the northern hemisphere, CO2 led temperature rise.

80
00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:12,000
So just as it's wrong for Al Gore to give the impression that CO2 always

81
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:16,320
leads temperature changes, it's wrong for Tony to give the impression that CO2

82
00:05:16,320 --> 00:05:20,080
always lags. If Tony's concerned that billions of

83
00:05:20,080 --> 00:05:23,120
school children are being lied to about this topic,

84
00:05:23,120 --> 00:05:27,840
and I don't doubt his sincerity, then I hope he'll join me in insisting that

85
00:05:27,840 --> 00:05:31,040
school children should be told what the science says,

86
00:05:31,040 --> 00:05:34,400
which is that carbon dioxide does both. It leads

87
00:05:34,400 --> 00:05:38,880
and lags temperature at different stages in the glacial cycle.

88
00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:42,160
Now let's go back and look at the ice core graph again.

89
00:05:42,160 --> 00:05:46,320
The graph shows swings in temperature of about 10 degrees centigrade

90
00:05:46,320 --> 00:05:51,440
during glacial cycles. These correspond with swings in carbon dioxide level in

91
00:05:51,440 --> 00:05:55,440
the atmosphere of about 100 parts per million. Now

92
00:05:55,440 --> 00:05:58,880
remember what Potholler said. He said that a very small change in

93
00:05:58,880 --> 00:06:02,080
temperature causes feedback from carbon dioxide,

94
00:06:02,080 --> 00:06:05,120
and that we get a 10 degree swing in temperature

95
00:06:05,120 --> 00:06:08,640
from a 100 part per million change in CO2.

96
00:06:08,640 --> 00:06:12,640
Does anyone remember me saying that we get a 10 degree swing in temperature

97
00:06:12,640 --> 00:06:16,160
from a 100 part per million change in CO2?

98
00:06:16,160 --> 00:06:20,480
No, because that would imply a ridiculously high figure for the Earth's

99
00:06:20,480 --> 00:06:23,440
sensitivity, which is how much the Earth responds

100
00:06:23,440 --> 00:06:28,000
to carbon dioxide forcing. Did Tony show a video clip of me saying

101
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:31,280
that? Of course not, because I never said any

102
00:06:31,280 --> 00:06:35,440
such thing. And yet when Tony made that claim, some

103
00:06:35,440 --> 00:06:39,440
people simply believed him without checking. That's why I got a

104
00:06:39,440 --> 00:06:43,200
couple of rather abusive messages on my channel.

105
00:06:43,200 --> 00:06:47,680
And that is completely ludicrous. It is, which is why I didn't say it.

106
00:06:47,680 --> 00:06:52,400
Not even the most outrageous claims of climate sensitivity come anywhere close to that level.

107
00:06:52,400 --> 00:06:56,640
I didn't say that, Tony. Okay, just to settle this, here's what I

108
00:06:56,640 --> 00:07:00,720
did say about climate sensitivity. And these estimates show that for a

109
00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:04,480
doubling of CO2 concentrations, we should see a rise in global

110
00:07:04,480 --> 00:07:08,400
temperatures of between 2 and 4.5 degrees.

111
00:07:08,400 --> 00:07:12,080
Now that's what I've reported, so what does Tony Heller say?

112
00:07:12,080 --> 00:07:15,840
According to the United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate

113
00:07:15,840 --> 00:07:18,240
Change, climate sensitivity is somewhere

114
00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:23,840
between 1.5 degrees centigrade and 4.5 degrees centigrade for a

115
00:07:23,840 --> 00:07:27,840
doubling of CO2. So it turns out Tony agrees with my

116
00:07:27,840 --> 00:07:32,080
reporting of the sensitivity estimates. There's a reason for the small half a

117
00:07:32,080 --> 00:07:37,520
degree difference in the lower estimate, but this is essentially the same result.

118
00:07:37,520 --> 00:07:40,720
So I didn't say that a 10 degree rise in temperature

119
00:07:40,720 --> 00:07:44,080
came from a 100 part per million rise in CO2.

120
00:07:44,080 --> 00:07:47,680
And certainly no study I've ever read has made such a claim,

121
00:07:47,680 --> 00:07:51,600
or given that interpretation to the data used to make the graph.

122
00:07:51,600 --> 00:07:55,600
Tony Heller assumed that that's what the graph shows, because he made a basic

123
00:07:55,600 --> 00:07:58,800
error when he tried to interpret the graph for himself.

124
00:07:58,800 --> 00:08:02,960
To find out what he got wrong, we first need to find out where he got this graph

125
00:08:02,960 --> 00:08:06,080
from. Tony doesn't tell us because he

126
00:08:06,080 --> 00:08:10,640
doesn't give his sources, so I had to track it down myself. It's

127
00:08:10,640 --> 00:08:14,720
been passed around the internet a lot, but by searching the image and

128
00:08:14,720 --> 00:08:19,280
screening the time it was first uploaded, I finally found the first posting of it

129
00:08:19,360 --> 00:08:22,880
from a slideshow, and that led me to this slide presentation

130
00:08:22,880 --> 00:08:25,920
at Harvard. The data for the graph, according to the

131
00:08:25,920 --> 00:08:29,680
authors, came from this paper by Petit et al.

132
00:08:29,680 --> 00:08:33,280
Reading Petit's paper, which gives us more detail about how the data were

133
00:08:33,280 --> 00:08:35,920
gathered, it's clear that the temperature scale on

134
00:08:35,920 --> 00:08:39,840
Tony's graph is not measuring average global temperature.

135
00:08:39,840 --> 00:08:44,560
The authors measured oxygen isotopes in the air bubbles trapped in the ice,

136
00:08:44,560 --> 00:08:47,680
which are good proxies for air temperatures. So,

137
00:08:47,680 --> 00:08:52,400
as they explain in the study, they're measuring temperature at two places,

138
00:08:52,400 --> 00:08:56,560
where the precipitation formed, in other words, where the snowflakes formed,

139
00:08:56,560 --> 00:09:00,800
and where the snowflakes fell and were later compressed into ice.

140
00:09:00,800 --> 00:09:05,120
To put it in even simpler terms, they weren't measuring global temperatures at

141
00:09:05,120 --> 00:09:07,360
all. They were measuring Antarctic

142
00:09:07,360 --> 00:09:10,960
temperatures. So, Tony's wrong to infer climate

143
00:09:10,960 --> 00:09:14,560
sensitivity from this, because climate sensitivity is based on

144
00:09:14,560 --> 00:09:18,160
average global temperatures, like the average global temperatures

145
00:09:18,160 --> 00:09:22,000
Tony looked at when he cites the IPCC result.

146
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:25,040
I'm sure everyone understands the difference between these

147
00:09:25,040 --> 00:09:30,400
average global temperature figures and these Antarctic temperature figures.

148
00:09:30,400 --> 00:09:34,480
Under potholars feedback theory, not my theory mate, we would have expected that

149
00:09:34,480 --> 00:09:38,560
as CO2 spiked, temperatures would have gone up too. Okay,

150
00:09:38,560 --> 00:09:42,240
there's obviously a genuine belief that this is my theory,

151
00:09:42,240 --> 00:09:46,080
so I'd better explain that the conclusion that post-glacial warming was

152
00:09:46,080 --> 00:09:51,520
amplified by positive feedback is a well-accepted scientific principle.

153
00:09:51,520 --> 00:09:55,440
Anyone with a passing interest in climate science would surely be aware

154
00:09:55,440 --> 00:09:58,640
of the mountainous studies that have been written about it.

155
00:09:58,640 --> 00:10:01,920
I've explained these positive feedback factors many times,

156
00:10:01,920 --> 00:10:06,480
citing scientific studies. So, if anyone thinks it's my theory,

157
00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:10,800
I'm very flattered, but I'm not nearly smart enough to have discovered it,

158
00:10:10,800 --> 00:10:14,800
so please read these studies for yourselves. And it isn't a recent

159
00:10:14,800 --> 00:10:17,760
phenomenon invented by fraudulent scientists.

160
00:10:17,760 --> 00:10:23,840
Positive feedback as a forcing amplifier has been understood since at least 1969,

161
00:10:23,840 --> 00:10:27,840
when Charles Keating of the Scripps Institute wrote about it.

162
00:10:27,840 --> 00:10:31,040
This summary explains positive feedback very well,

163
00:10:31,040 --> 00:10:36,320
published in 1979. So, to answer the question of whether temperature goes up,

164
00:10:36,320 --> 00:10:41,760
after CO2 goes up, yes, researchers have shown that it clearly does.

165
00:10:41,760 --> 00:10:46,320
What Tony is wondering is why, therefore, don't temperatures keep rising

166
00:10:46,320 --> 00:10:51,440
when CO2 hits its peak? We would have expected that as CO2 spiked,

167
00:10:51,440 --> 00:10:55,840
temperatures would have gone up too. Well, when something doesn't make any sense to

168
00:10:55,840 --> 00:10:58,160
me, I don't assume that the science must be

169
00:10:58,160 --> 00:11:02,480
wrong. I try to find out if professional researchers have an answer.

170
00:11:02,480 --> 00:11:07,360
And of course they do. What researchers have found is that towards the end of

171
00:11:07,360 --> 00:11:11,040
each deglaciation, the forcing stops and the Earth reaches

172
00:11:11,040 --> 00:11:16,720
what's called equilibrium temperature. It enters an interglacial. Now, negative

173
00:11:16,720 --> 00:11:21,120
forcing takes effect. The most likely reason for this change is

174
00:11:21,120 --> 00:11:24,880
the Milankovitch cycles. As the southern hemisphere receives a

175
00:11:24,880 --> 00:11:29,440
little less insulation, the oceans cool, dissolving more CO2,

176
00:11:29,440 --> 00:11:33,120
which reduces CO2 concentration in the atmosphere.

177
00:11:33,120 --> 00:11:37,440
And colder conditions create more ice, increasing albedo

178
00:11:37,440 --> 00:11:42,560
and reflecting more sunlight. It's the reverse of what happens at the start of

179
00:11:42,560 --> 00:11:47,280
a deglaciation. Look how quickly we come out of ice ages,

180
00:11:47,280 --> 00:11:53,040
starting with very low levels of CO2. This is the exact opposite of what we'd

181
00:11:53,040 --> 00:11:56,560
expect from CO2 theory. Of course, you only need to read the

182
00:11:56,640 --> 00:12:00,880
published studies to see that these observations aren't the opposite.

183
00:12:00,880 --> 00:12:04,400
They're completely consistent. To recap briefly,

184
00:12:04,400 --> 00:12:08,720
the research shows that a small increase in insulation warms the oceans

185
00:12:08,720 --> 00:12:12,160
and that causes CO2 to come out of solution.

186
00:12:12,160 --> 00:12:15,360
Now, if CO2 wasn't a powerful greenhouse gas,

187
00:12:15,360 --> 00:12:18,800
that would be the end of the line. Research has shown that the small

188
00:12:18,800 --> 00:12:22,560
increase in insulation alone wouldn't be enough to melt all the ice

189
00:12:22,560 --> 00:12:25,600
sheets. So there would be no way to explain how

190
00:12:25,600 --> 00:12:31,040
each glaciation came to an end. But if CO2 is a powerful greenhouse gas,

191
00:12:31,040 --> 00:12:34,480
then the result would be more warming, amplified by positive

192
00:12:34,480 --> 00:12:38,720
feedback, bringing us quickly out of the glaciation.

193
00:12:38,720 --> 00:12:42,800
So how can this process be the opposite of the theory that CO2 is a powerful

194
00:12:42,800 --> 00:12:45,840
greenhouse gas when the entire sequence of events

195
00:12:45,840 --> 00:12:50,320
depends on it? In 2004, the guy who's in charge of

196
00:12:50,320 --> 00:12:53,600
temperature records at NASA, Gavin Schmidt, said

197
00:12:53,680 --> 00:12:58,400
during recent decades, surface temperatures decreased significantly over

198
00:12:58,400 --> 00:13:02,000
most of Antarctica. Let's remember now that we're talking

199
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:06,240
about Antarctic ice core records. Gavin Schmidt says the temperature is

200
00:13:06,240 --> 00:13:12,400
going down as CO2 has spiked. Under pothole's feedback theory, not my

201
00:13:12,400 --> 00:13:15,840
theory mate, you would have expected that as CO2 spiked,

202
00:13:15,840 --> 00:13:19,520
temperatures would have gone up too. Okay, a lot of assumptions and

203
00:13:19,520 --> 00:13:23,360
misunderstandings here. The problem seems to be that Tony's only

204
00:13:23,360 --> 00:13:26,640
reading the abstract of the study on a NASA website.

205
00:13:26,640 --> 00:13:30,640
He needs to read the paper itself, where the source of his misunderstanding is

206
00:13:30,640 --> 00:13:34,320
revealed. In the paper itself, the authors show

207
00:13:34,320 --> 00:13:38,720
that ozone depletion and greenhouse gases exacerbated a

208
00:13:38,720 --> 00:13:41,440
phenomenon called the southern annular mode,

209
00:13:41,440 --> 00:13:46,640
or the SAM, which defines the changing position of the southern wind belt.

210
00:13:46,640 --> 00:13:50,400
According to the study, 90 percent of the cooling at South Pole and East

211
00:13:50,400 --> 00:13:54,480
Antarctica stations correlated to the SAM, so their

212
00:13:54,480 --> 00:13:57,440
conclusion was that recent cooling over the Antarctic

213
00:13:57,440 --> 00:14:01,120
continental interior has likely been caused by both ozone

214
00:14:01,120 --> 00:14:06,080
depletion and greenhouse gas increases. Now that's a clear distinction between

215
00:14:06,080 --> 00:14:10,000
global warming now and global warming during deglaciations

216
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:14,320
of the past. Firstly, ozone depletion over Antarctica

217
00:14:14,320 --> 00:14:18,160
is not something known to have occurred or been a factor at the end of each

218
00:14:18,200 --> 00:14:22,320
deglaciation. Secondly, while greenhouse gases are the

219
00:14:22,320 --> 00:14:25,840
initial forcing now, during deglaciation periods the

220
00:14:25,840 --> 00:14:31,360
initial forcing was increased insulation, as other studies I've cited explain. And

221
00:14:31,360 --> 00:14:35,200
the third difference, which wasn't in the Schindel and Schmidt paper but which has

222
00:14:35,200 --> 00:14:39,120
been shown in other studies, is that during deglaciations the

223
00:14:39,120 --> 00:14:42,560
initial forcing was insulation in the southern hemisphere,

224
00:14:42,560 --> 00:14:47,280
much closer to Antarctica. Now the initial forcing is CO2 in the

225
00:14:47,280 --> 00:14:51,600
northern hemisphere, much further away. So of course

226
00:14:51,600 --> 00:14:56,720
Antarctica is responding differently. Not to mention the fact that 100 years is

227
00:14:56,720 --> 00:15:00,320
a long period in terms of the warming we're experiencing now,

228
00:15:00,320 --> 00:15:04,400
but a very short time period in terms of glacial cycles.

229
00:15:04,400 --> 00:15:08,400
It's been understood for a long time that if the feedback is greater than the

230
00:15:08,400 --> 00:15:11,040
signal, it will go out of control and there's no

231
00:15:11,040 --> 00:15:15,040
way to stop it. He's claiming that the feedback is much

232
00:15:15,040 --> 00:15:19,440
larger than the driver or a gain of much larger than one.

233
00:15:19,440 --> 00:15:23,120
If that was true there would be no way to stop it once you start it down into

234
00:15:23,120 --> 00:15:26,720
an ice age or just keep getting colder and colder until the whole Earth was

235
00:15:26,720 --> 00:15:29,520
covered with ice and there'd be no way to get back out

236
00:15:29,520 --> 00:15:32,160
of it. Well of course I'm not claiming this.

237
00:15:32,160 --> 00:15:36,160
Researchers are claiming it and they've shown all their evidence in published

238
00:15:36,160 --> 00:15:40,240
papers for Tony or anyone else to read and learn the scientific

239
00:15:40,240 --> 00:15:44,400
explanation. I have to admit though I had exactly the

240
00:15:44,400 --> 00:15:48,160
same question years ago when I started doing videos about this.

241
00:15:48,160 --> 00:15:52,000
I would have agreed with Tony. It didn't make much sense to me.

242
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:55,440
But instead of assuming the science must be wrong and therefore it's

243
00:15:55,440 --> 00:15:59,280
deliberately faked, I assumed that maybe these professional

244
00:15:59,280 --> 00:16:03,680
researchers knew something I didn't. I always find that the easiest way to

245
00:16:03,680 --> 00:16:05,680
get an answer when you don't know something

246
00:16:05,680 --> 00:16:09,360
is to simply ask. So I asked some climatologists

247
00:16:09,360 --> 00:16:13,360
and the answer turned out to be surprisingly easy.

248
00:16:13,360 --> 00:16:18,080
Once the initial forcing stops, positive feedback has diminishing returns.

249
00:16:18,080 --> 00:16:21,680
It's a bit like a child pushing himself on a swing.

250
00:16:21,680 --> 00:16:25,920
He can go higher and higher as long as he's giving a bit of a kick with his

251
00:16:25,920 --> 00:16:29,600
legs. But if he stops doing that and just sits

252
00:16:29,600 --> 00:16:34,320
there, in other words the forcing stops, then the swing will keep swinging but

253
00:16:34,320 --> 00:16:37,280
with a smaller and smaller amplitude each time

254
00:16:37,280 --> 00:16:42,240
until it finally comes to a stop. On top of that a basic principle of

255
00:16:42,240 --> 00:16:46,720
thermodynamics comes into effect which I've explained in my videos. The

256
00:16:46,720 --> 00:16:49,120
positive feedback doesn't go on forever of course

257
00:16:49,120 --> 00:16:53,360
because as the temperature of the earth rises it radiates more heat.

258
00:16:53,360 --> 00:16:57,280
So once the initial forcing has stopped the temperature keeps rising

259
00:16:57,280 --> 00:17:01,120
until the amount of heat leaving the earth balances the amount of heat coming

260
00:17:01,120 --> 00:17:04,640
in. The earth then stabilises at a higher

261
00:17:04,640 --> 00:17:08,240
temperature called the equilibrium temperature.

262
00:17:08,240 --> 00:17:12,400
Another good question is what happens if the forcing doesn't stop?

263
00:17:12,400 --> 00:17:17,360
What if it goes on forever? But of course every forcing eventually stops.

264
00:17:17,360 --> 00:17:21,360
No flood basalt event which caused CO2 release in the past

265
00:17:21,360 --> 00:17:26,000
goes on forever. Milankovitch cycles never go in one direction forever

266
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:30,640
that's why they're called cycles. So it's not a question of whether the

267
00:17:30,640 --> 00:17:34,320
forcing will stop but obviously the longer the forcing goes

268
00:17:34,320 --> 00:17:38,400
on the higher the final equilibrium temperature will be.

269
00:17:38,400 --> 00:17:42,000
The off-sided claim that methane is a potent greenhouse gas

270
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:45,040
simply isn't true. Well that's very easy to check.

271
00:17:45,040 --> 00:17:49,360
Just read the studies. Here's one that measured the spectral absorption of

272
00:17:49,360 --> 00:17:52,960
methane and found that although methane overlaps water vapor

273
00:17:52,960 --> 00:17:57,200
in the 3.3 micrometer band it fills windows in the spectrum in the

274
00:17:57,200 --> 00:18:02,480
1.6 and 2.3 micrometer bands. Their measurements show that the

275
00:18:02,480 --> 00:18:05,760
increase in methane concentration since 1750

276
00:18:05,760 --> 00:18:08,960
has therefore led to a net radiative forcing of about

277
00:18:08,960 --> 00:18:14,240
0.61 watts per square meter. Numerous other studies also contradict

278
00:18:14,240 --> 00:18:17,600
Tony's belief that methane is not a greenhouse gas.

279
00:18:17,600 --> 00:18:21,920
They show it has an estimated global warming potential of around 30 times

280
00:18:21,920 --> 00:18:25,440
that of carbon dioxide. I checked back in the scientific

281
00:18:25,440 --> 00:18:29,440
literature and this has been known for over four decades.

282
00:18:29,440 --> 00:18:33,840
Methane is only two parts per million in the atmosphere. But as any scientist

283
00:18:33,840 --> 00:18:36,400
will tell you just because something is small in

284
00:18:36,400 --> 00:18:40,560
quantity doesn't mean it has a correspondingly small effect.

285
00:18:40,560 --> 00:18:45,440
If you don't agree try ingesting just 0.06 percent of your body weight in

286
00:18:45,440 --> 00:18:49,040
strychnine and see what effect that has. The layer

287
00:18:49,040 --> 00:18:53,120
of ozone in the stratosphere makes up a tiny percentage of the gases in the

288
00:18:53,120 --> 00:18:56,320
atmosphere but without it plants and animals would

289
00:18:56,320 --> 00:19:01,040
fry under ultraviolet light. Scientists judge the efficacy of a

290
00:19:01,040 --> 00:19:03,680
chemical by measuring the effect of a given

291
00:19:03,680 --> 00:19:07,600
quantity not by assuming that because the quantity is small

292
00:19:07,600 --> 00:19:11,280
it can't have any effect. And it's very unstable.

293
00:19:11,280 --> 00:19:15,360
It oxidizes into carbon dioxide and water very quickly.

294
00:19:15,360 --> 00:19:19,520
No, it takes 12 years for half of a given amount of methane to break down into

295
00:19:19,520 --> 00:19:23,920
CO2 and water. So if a ton of methane is released then

296
00:19:23,920 --> 00:19:26,640
as a rule of thumb half a ton will still be in the

297
00:19:26,640 --> 00:19:30,560
atmosphere after 12 years. A quarter of a ton will still be there

298
00:19:30,560 --> 00:19:35,040
after 24 years and so on. That's why the global warming

299
00:19:35,040 --> 00:19:38,240
potential of methane is given according to the length of

300
00:19:38,240 --> 00:19:43,120
time being measured. Again this isn't my theory. This is what

301
00:19:43,120 --> 00:19:46,000
studies over the last 40 years have found.

302
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:50,240
There's no way to get a large buildup of methane in an atmosphere which contains

303
00:19:50,240 --> 00:19:53,680
a significant amount of oxygen. It just can't happen.

304
00:19:53,680 --> 00:19:57,120
And yet here it is. Not only does it happen

305
00:19:57,120 --> 00:20:01,920
but researchers can measure it. The amount is increasing as human activity

306
00:20:01,920 --> 00:20:07,120
and positive feedback produce more of it. The concentration has more than doubled

307
00:20:07,120 --> 00:20:11,120
from 750 parts per billion in pre-industrial times

308
00:20:11,120 --> 00:20:17,040
to around 1800 parts per billion today. So although it's not as long-lived as

309
00:20:17,040 --> 00:20:20,000
carbon dioxide it's sticking around long enough to have

310
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:23,600
an increasing impact which is why so much research is being

311
00:20:23,600 --> 00:20:27,360
done on its effects. Geologists are also estimating its

312
00:20:27,360 --> 00:20:32,160
impact on past warming. So let's review everything Potholer did

313
00:20:32,160 --> 00:20:36,400
wrong. Yes this should be fun and we'll put my responses in there to

314
00:20:36,400 --> 00:20:40,640
sum up. First he made the baseless claim that whatever drives ice ages

315
00:20:40,640 --> 00:20:44,800
is very small even though he didn't know what the mechanism was.

316
00:20:44,800 --> 00:20:48,480
A strong contender has always been regular cyclical deviation in the Earth's

317
00:20:48,480 --> 00:20:51,520
position or orbit changing the amount of sunlight the

318
00:20:51,520 --> 00:20:56,160
Earth received. The most likely trigger was the Milankovitch cycles changes in

319
00:20:56,160 --> 00:21:00,080
the Earth's tilt and orbit that caused more insulation. Then he stated the

320
00:21:00,080 --> 00:21:04,560
outrageous claim that a huge amount of feedback on top of a tiny signal is what

321
00:21:04,560 --> 00:21:09,360
was driving ice age descent and ascent. He didn't provide any

322
00:21:09,360 --> 00:21:12,400
evidence for that. A paper by Laureus et al shows that

323
00:21:12,400 --> 00:21:16,320
insulation has varied by only 0.7 watts per square meter

324
00:21:16,320 --> 00:21:20,480
over the last 160,000 years. Climatologists agree that the amount of

325
00:21:20,480 --> 00:21:24,320
forcing from the Earth's changing orbit, thought to be the initial trigger for

326
00:21:24,320 --> 00:21:27,760
deglaciation, had nowhere near enough energy to thaw

327
00:21:27,760 --> 00:21:30,320
ice covering a large portion of the planet.

328
00:21:30,320 --> 00:21:34,080
And as I showed you the climate sensitivity that would be necessary for

329
00:21:34,080 --> 00:21:37,120
that to occur is about 10 times higher than even the

330
00:21:37,120 --> 00:21:41,600
most extreme IPCC estimates of climate sensitivity. But as we

331
00:21:41,600 --> 00:21:44,800
saw Tony got that absurdly high sensitivity

332
00:21:44,800 --> 00:21:48,640
by looking at a graph he got off the internet without checking the data it

333
00:21:48,640 --> 00:21:51,440
came from and without noticing that these are

334
00:21:51,440 --> 00:21:56,000
Antarctic temperatures, not global averages. And he then compared

335
00:21:56,000 --> 00:22:00,880
that with actual sensitivity estimates which do use global averages. Then I

336
00:22:00,880 --> 00:22:04,960
showed you using feedback theory that the feedback has to be smaller than the

337
00:22:04,960 --> 00:22:07,840
signal. Otherwise the climate would be unstable

338
00:22:07,840 --> 00:22:11,760
and Earth would either be like Venus or it'd be snowball Earth. But what you

339
00:22:11,760 --> 00:22:15,520
didn't understand is that this would only be true as long as the forcing

340
00:22:15,520 --> 00:22:19,200
continues. Once the forcing stops, positive feedback

341
00:22:19,200 --> 00:22:24,160
has diminishing returns. In addition, outgoing energy rises as the

342
00:22:24,160 --> 00:22:28,160
temperature of the Earth increases, bringing us to a higher equilibrium

343
00:22:28,160 --> 00:22:32,960
temperature, as I explained in my videos. Then I showed you how his teeter-totter

344
00:22:32,960 --> 00:22:36,480
diagram was unsupportable because it suddenly hit the ground and

345
00:22:36,480 --> 00:22:41,040
stopped, but he never defined what the ground was. The basic laws of

346
00:22:41,040 --> 00:22:45,040
physics tell us that the Earth will heat up in response to this extra energy

347
00:22:45,040 --> 00:22:48,480
and the temperature will keep rising until the increased amount of energy

348
00:22:48,480 --> 00:22:51,840
radiated out matches the amount coming in, what's

349
00:22:51,840 --> 00:22:55,120
called equilibrium. The temperature will eventually

350
00:22:55,120 --> 00:22:58,880
stabilize at a higher level. Then he made claims about methane which

351
00:22:58,880 --> 00:23:02,720
are unsupportable. Well it's supported by 40 years of solid

352
00:23:02,720 --> 00:23:06,000
scientific research and all the studies I've cited which

353
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:08,480
have measured methane's global warming potential,

354
00:23:08,480 --> 00:23:12,240
its longevity and its increasing presence in the atmosphere.

355
00:23:12,240 --> 00:23:15,440
And methane is very unstable. You can't build up

356
00:23:15,440 --> 00:23:18,960
large amounts of methane in the atmosphere. And as direct measurements

357
00:23:18,960 --> 00:23:23,120
clearly show, yes you can.
