00:00.000 --> 00:03.680
My thanks to Tony Heller for checking my channel for accuracy

00:03.680 --> 00:08.560
in his video Debunking the Debunker. A lot of people ask me to respond,

00:08.560 --> 00:13.760
so I'm happy to do so. I'll go through his claims in chronological order.

00:13.760 --> 00:18.800
Here's the first one. He claims that a tiny bit of cooling triggers ice ages

00:18.800 --> 00:23.440
and a tiny bit of warming ends them. Well the researchers I cite conclude this,

00:23.440 --> 00:27.280
not me. But he doesn't provide any evidence of the magnitude of these

00:27.280 --> 00:31.920
changes. Actually I do. I not only give the figures, I cite and

00:31.920 --> 00:37.040
show the study they came from. This is from my video Does CO2 Lead or

00:37.040 --> 00:40.960
Lag Global Warming? A paper by Lorius et al shows that

00:40.960 --> 00:44.880
insulation has varied by only 0.7 watts per square meter

00:44.880 --> 00:50.080
over the last 160,000 years. In other words, the tiny amount of forcing due to

00:50.080 --> 00:53.600
the Earth's orbit wasn't enough to defrost miles of thick

00:53.600 --> 00:59.360
ice covering a large part of the planet. Listen carefully to what he says here.

00:59.360 --> 01:03.200
But each time something had to act as that initial trigger.

01:03.200 --> 01:06.880
Something had to nudge the round weight just a fraction.

01:06.880 --> 01:10.640
A strong contender has always been regular cyclical deviation in the Earth's

01:10.640 --> 01:13.600
position or orbit, changing the amount of sunlight the

01:13.600 --> 01:17.280
Earth received. Whatever it was, in the depths of the ice

01:17.280 --> 01:20.240
age this change melted a tiny part of the ice sheet

01:20.320 --> 01:24.080
and released carbon gases from the soil and from the warmer oceans.

01:24.080 --> 01:28.720
Whatever it was, he doesn't actually know what the trigger of the ice ages is, but

01:28.720 --> 01:31.600
he claims to know that the magnitude of it is small.

01:31.600 --> 01:34.960
But didn't I just explain what researchers think it was?

01:34.960 --> 01:38.800
Tony even played the clip. A strong contender has always been regular

01:38.800 --> 01:41.920
cyclical deviation in the Earth's position or orbit,

01:41.920 --> 01:46.080
changing the amount of sunlight the Earth received. These orbital movements

01:46.080 --> 01:48.800
and wobbles are called Milankovitch cycles.

01:48.800 --> 01:53.520
In another video I explain that again. Researchers say carbon dioxide was not

01:53.520 --> 01:57.760
the cause of the initial warming during any of the recent deglaciations.

01:57.760 --> 02:00.960
The most likely trigger was the Milankovitch cycles,

02:00.960 --> 02:05.200
changes in the Earth's tilt and orbit that caused more insulation.

02:05.200 --> 02:08.640
What if the effect of those orbital cycles was actually very large?

02:08.640 --> 02:12.800
Then his entire theory goes down the drain immediately. But as I point out,

02:12.800 --> 02:16.080
researchers have calculated that they aren't large.

02:16.080 --> 02:20.400
And again, it's not my theory. Professional researchers know very

02:20.400 --> 02:23.680
precisely what these orbital variations are,

02:23.680 --> 02:27.040
and they can calculate within given margins of error

02:27.040 --> 02:30.480
how much they affect the energy budget of the Earth.

02:30.480 --> 02:34.400
Of course, Tony can speculate that it's much bigger or much smaller.

02:34.400 --> 02:39.280
He's free to imagine any figures he likes. But researchers can't do that.

02:39.280 --> 02:42.880
They have to go with what the measurements and calculations show.

02:42.880 --> 02:46.240
And as a science reporter, I can't do that either.

02:46.240 --> 02:49.440
I have to accurately report their results.

02:49.440 --> 02:52.800
Tony goes on to describe how a small amount of warming

02:52.800 --> 02:57.520
causes oceans to release CO2, since carbon dioxide is less soluble at

02:57.520 --> 03:02.400
higher water temperature. I explain exactly the same thing, so no

03:02.400 --> 03:05.840
argument there. So the relationship here, as Potholler

03:05.840 --> 03:09.600
correctly stated, is that CO2 follows temperature.

03:09.680 --> 03:13.840
Temperature changes first, and the CO2 changes later.

03:13.840 --> 03:18.400
What he blew over in his discussion was that Al Gore said the exact opposite.

03:18.400 --> 03:21.680
He tried to make it sound like CO2 drove the temperature.

03:21.680 --> 03:25.680
He did indeed, and I pointed out his mistake very clearly.

03:25.680 --> 03:29.920
In his film An Inconvenient Truth, Al Gore used a graph like this to show a

03:29.920 --> 03:32.400
correlation between carbon dioxide levels

03:32.400 --> 03:36.160
and increased temperatures. But he obscured the fact that the carbon

03:36.160 --> 03:40.160
dioxide increases lag the temperature increases by 800

03:40.160 --> 03:43.520
years. So I didn't blow over this at all. It's

03:43.520 --> 03:46.240
right there. Billions of school children around the

03:46.240 --> 03:50.560
world have been lied to about this topic, and Potholler didn't seem to think that

03:50.560 --> 03:54.640
was very important. Now that's a bit unfair. I think that's

03:54.640 --> 03:57.840
extremely important, and if you'd asked me, Tony, I would have

03:57.840 --> 04:01.840
been very happy to tell you that. I've made no indication in any of my

04:01.840 --> 04:05.680
videos that I'm not concerned about children being misinformed about

04:05.680 --> 04:08.880
science, whether it's by Al Gore or Laurie David

04:08.880 --> 04:12.560
or anyone else. I've frequently spoken out in my videos

04:12.560 --> 04:16.320
about the need to stop junk science creeping into classrooms,

04:16.320 --> 04:20.960
and I'm happy to repeat that now. I've also said schools need to spend more

04:20.960 --> 04:24.400
time teaching children how to tell the difference between real

04:24.400 --> 04:29.920
science and junk science on the internet. But let's just get back to what Tony

04:29.920 --> 04:34.080
claims I agree with. So the relationship here, as Potholler

04:34.080 --> 04:37.840
correctly stated, is that CO2 follows temperature.

04:37.840 --> 04:41.600
Temperature changes first, and the CO2 changes later.

04:41.600 --> 04:45.680
Well I didn't say the relationship here is that CO2 follows temperature,

04:45.680 --> 04:50.160
obviously, because this is a graph covering several glacial cycles.

04:50.160 --> 04:54.000
What I said was that CO2 followed temperatures in the early stages of

04:54.000 --> 04:57.520
deglaciation in the southern hemisphere, because I'm

04:57.520 --> 05:00.400
reporting the conclusion of scientific studies.

05:00.400 --> 05:03.920
In the latter stages of deglaciation shown on the graph,

05:03.920 --> 05:08.160
and in the northern hemisphere, CO2 led temperature rise.

05:08.160 --> 05:12.000
So just as it's wrong for Al Gore to give the impression that CO2 always

05:12.000 --> 05:16.320
leads temperature changes, it's wrong for Tony to give the impression that CO2

05:16.320 --> 05:20.080
always lags. If Tony's concerned that billions of

05:20.080 --> 05:23.120
school children are being lied to about this topic,

05:23.120 --> 05:27.840
and I don't doubt his sincerity, then I hope he'll join me in insisting that

05:27.840 --> 05:31.040
school children should be told what the science says,

05:31.040 --> 05:34.400
which is that carbon dioxide does both. It leads

05:34.400 --> 05:38.880
and lags temperature at different stages in the glacial cycle.

05:38.880 --> 05:42.160
Now let's go back and look at the ice core graph again.

05:42.160 --> 05:46.320
The graph shows swings in temperature of about 10 degrees centigrade

05:46.320 --> 05:51.440
during glacial cycles. These correspond with swings in carbon dioxide level in

05:51.440 --> 05:55.440
the atmosphere of about 100 parts per million. Now

05:55.440 --> 05:58.880
remember what Potholler said. He said that a very small change in

05:58.880 --> 06:02.080
temperature causes feedback from carbon dioxide,

06:02.080 --> 06:05.120
and that we get a 10 degree swing in temperature

06:05.120 --> 06:08.640
from a 100 part per million change in CO2.

06:08.640 --> 06:12.640
Does anyone remember me saying that we get a 10 degree swing in temperature

06:12.640 --> 06:16.160
from a 100 part per million change in CO2?

06:16.160 --> 06:20.480
No, because that would imply a ridiculously high figure for the Earth's

06:20.480 --> 06:23.440
sensitivity, which is how much the Earth responds

06:23.440 --> 06:28.000
to carbon dioxide forcing. Did Tony show a video clip of me saying

06:28.000 --> 06:31.280
that? Of course not, because I never said any

06:31.280 --> 06:35.440
such thing. And yet when Tony made that claim, some

06:35.440 --> 06:39.440
people simply believed him without checking. That's why I got a

06:39.440 --> 06:43.200
couple of rather abusive messages on my channel.

06:43.200 --> 06:47.680
And that is completely ludicrous. It is, which is why I didn't say it.

06:47.680 --> 06:52.400
Not even the most outrageous claims of climate sensitivity come anywhere close to that level.

06:52.400 --> 06:56.640
I didn't say that, Tony. Okay, just to settle this, here's what I

06:56.640 --> 07:00.720
did say about climate sensitivity. And these estimates show that for a

07:00.720 --> 07:04.480
doubling of CO2 concentrations, we should see a rise in global

07:04.480 --> 07:08.400
temperatures of between 2 and 4.5 degrees.

07:08.400 --> 07:12.080
Now that's what I've reported, so what does Tony Heller say?

07:12.080 --> 07:15.840
According to the United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate

07:15.840 --> 07:18.240
Change, climate sensitivity is somewhere

07:18.240 --> 07:23.840
between 1.5 degrees centigrade and 4.5 degrees centigrade for a

07:23.840 --> 07:27.840
doubling of CO2. So it turns out Tony agrees with my

07:27.840 --> 07:32.080
reporting of the sensitivity estimates. There's a reason for the small half a

07:32.080 --> 07:37.520
degree difference in the lower estimate, but this is essentially the same result.

07:37.520 --> 07:40.720
So I didn't say that a 10 degree rise in temperature

07:40.720 --> 07:44.080
came from a 100 part per million rise in CO2.

07:44.080 --> 07:47.680
And certainly no study I've ever read has made such a claim,

07:47.680 --> 07:51.600
or given that interpretation to the data used to make the graph.

07:51.600 --> 07:55.600
Tony Heller assumed that that's what the graph shows, because he made a basic

07:55.600 --> 07:58.800
error when he tried to interpret the graph for himself.

07:58.800 --> 08:02.960
To find out what he got wrong, we first need to find out where he got this graph

08:02.960 --> 08:06.080
from. Tony doesn't tell us because he

08:06.080 --> 08:10.640
doesn't give his sources, so I had to track it down myself. It's

08:10.640 --> 08:14.720
been passed around the internet a lot, but by searching the image and

08:14.720 --> 08:19.280
screening the time it was first uploaded, I finally found the first posting of it

08:19.360 --> 08:22.880
from a slideshow, and that led me to this slide presentation

08:22.880 --> 08:25.920
at Harvard. The data for the graph, according to the

08:25.920 --> 08:29.680
authors, came from this paper by Petit et al.

08:29.680 --> 08:33.280
Reading Petit's paper, which gives us more detail about how the data were

08:33.280 --> 08:35.920
gathered, it's clear that the temperature scale on

08:35.920 --> 08:39.840
Tony's graph is not measuring average global temperature.

08:39.840 --> 08:44.560
The authors measured oxygen isotopes in the air bubbles trapped in the ice,

08:44.560 --> 08:47.680
which are good proxies for air temperatures. So,

08:47.680 --> 08:52.400
as they explain in the study, they're measuring temperature at two places,

08:52.400 --> 08:56.560
where the precipitation formed, in other words, where the snowflakes formed,

08:56.560 --> 09:00.800
and where the snowflakes fell and were later compressed into ice.

09:00.800 --> 09:05.120
To put it in even simpler terms, they weren't measuring global temperatures at

09:05.120 --> 09:07.360
all. They were measuring Antarctic

09:07.360 --> 09:10.960
temperatures. So, Tony's wrong to infer climate

09:10.960 --> 09:14.560
sensitivity from this, because climate sensitivity is based on

09:14.560 --> 09:18.160
average global temperatures, like the average global temperatures

09:18.160 --> 09:22.000
Tony looked at when he cites the IPCC result.

09:22.000 --> 09:25.040
I'm sure everyone understands the difference between these

09:25.040 --> 09:30.400
average global temperature figures and these Antarctic temperature figures.

09:30.400 --> 09:34.480
Under potholars feedback theory, not my theory mate, we would have expected that

09:34.480 --> 09:38.560
as CO2 spiked, temperatures would have gone up too. Okay,

09:38.560 --> 09:42.240
there's obviously a genuine belief that this is my theory,

09:42.240 --> 09:46.080
so I'd better explain that the conclusion that post-glacial warming was

09:46.080 --> 09:51.520
amplified by positive feedback is a well-accepted scientific principle.

09:51.520 --> 09:55.440
Anyone with a passing interest in climate science would surely be aware

09:55.440 --> 09:58.640
of the mountainous studies that have been written about it.

09:58.640 --> 10:01.920
I've explained these positive feedback factors many times,

10:01.920 --> 10:06.480
citing scientific studies. So, if anyone thinks it's my theory,

10:06.480 --> 10:10.800
I'm very flattered, but I'm not nearly smart enough to have discovered it,

10:10.800 --> 10:14.800
so please read these studies for yourselves. And it isn't a recent

10:14.800 --> 10:17.760
phenomenon invented by fraudulent scientists.

10:17.760 --> 10:23.840
Positive feedback as a forcing amplifier has been understood since at least 1969,

10:23.840 --> 10:27.840
when Charles Keating of the Scripps Institute wrote about it.

10:27.840 --> 10:31.040
This summary explains positive feedback very well,

10:31.040 --> 10:36.320
published in 1979. So, to answer the question of whether temperature goes up,

10:36.320 --> 10:41.760
after CO2 goes up, yes, researchers have shown that it clearly does.

10:41.760 --> 10:46.320
What Tony is wondering is why, therefore, don't temperatures keep rising

10:46.320 --> 10:51.440
when CO2 hits its peak? We would have expected that as CO2 spiked,

10:51.440 --> 10:55.840
temperatures would have gone up too. Well, when something doesn't make any sense to

10:55.840 --> 10:58.160
me, I don't assume that the science must be

10:58.160 --> 11:02.480
wrong. I try to find out if professional researchers have an answer.

11:02.480 --> 11:07.360
And of course they do. What researchers have found is that towards the end of

11:07.360 --> 11:11.040
each deglaciation, the forcing stops and the Earth reaches

11:11.040 --> 11:16.720
what's called equilibrium temperature. It enters an interglacial. Now, negative

11:16.720 --> 11:21.120
forcing takes effect. The most likely reason for this change is

11:21.120 --> 11:24.880
the Milankovitch cycles. As the southern hemisphere receives a

11:24.880 --> 11:29.440
little less insulation, the oceans cool, dissolving more CO2,

11:29.440 --> 11:33.120
which reduces CO2 concentration in the atmosphere.

11:33.120 --> 11:37.440
And colder conditions create more ice, increasing albedo

11:37.440 --> 11:42.560
and reflecting more sunlight. It's the reverse of what happens at the start of

11:42.560 --> 11:47.280
a deglaciation. Look how quickly we come out of ice ages,

11:47.280 --> 11:53.040
starting with very low levels of CO2. This is the exact opposite of what we'd

11:53.040 --> 11:56.560
expect from CO2 theory. Of course, you only need to read the

11:56.640 --> 12:00.880
published studies to see that these observations aren't the opposite.

12:00.880 --> 12:04.400
They're completely consistent. To recap briefly,

12:04.400 --> 12:08.720
the research shows that a small increase in insulation warms the oceans

12:08.720 --> 12:12.160
and that causes CO2 to come out of solution.

12:12.160 --> 12:15.360
Now, if CO2 wasn't a powerful greenhouse gas,

12:15.360 --> 12:18.800
that would be the end of the line. Research has shown that the small

12:18.800 --> 12:22.560
increase in insulation alone wouldn't be enough to melt all the ice

12:22.560 --> 12:25.600
sheets. So there would be no way to explain how

12:25.600 --> 12:31.040
each glaciation came to an end. But if CO2 is a powerful greenhouse gas,

12:31.040 --> 12:34.480
then the result would be more warming, amplified by positive

12:34.480 --> 12:38.720
feedback, bringing us quickly out of the glaciation.

12:38.720 --> 12:42.800
So how can this process be the opposite of the theory that CO2 is a powerful

12:42.800 --> 12:45.840
greenhouse gas when the entire sequence of events

12:45.840 --> 12:50.320
depends on it? In 2004, the guy who's in charge of

12:50.320 --> 12:53.600
temperature records at NASA, Gavin Schmidt, said

12:53.680 --> 12:58.400
during recent decades, surface temperatures decreased significantly over

12:58.400 --> 13:02.000
most of Antarctica. Let's remember now that we're talking

13:02.000 --> 13:06.240
about Antarctic ice core records. Gavin Schmidt says the temperature is

13:06.240 --> 13:12.400
going down as CO2 has spiked. Under pothole's feedback theory, not my

13:12.400 --> 13:15.840
theory mate, you would have expected that as CO2 spiked,

13:15.840 --> 13:19.520
temperatures would have gone up too. Okay, a lot of assumptions and

13:19.520 --> 13:23.360
misunderstandings here. The problem seems to be that Tony's only

13:23.360 --> 13:26.640
reading the abstract of the study on a NASA website.

13:26.640 --> 13:30.640
He needs to read the paper itself, where the source of his misunderstanding is

13:30.640 --> 13:34.320
revealed. In the paper itself, the authors show

13:34.320 --> 13:38.720
that ozone depletion and greenhouse gases exacerbated a

13:38.720 --> 13:41.440
phenomenon called the southern annular mode,

13:41.440 --> 13:46.640
or the SAM, which defines the changing position of the southern wind belt.

13:46.640 --> 13:50.400
According to the study, 90 percent of the cooling at South Pole and East

13:50.400 --> 13:54.480
Antarctica stations correlated to the SAM, so their

13:54.480 --> 13:57.440
conclusion was that recent cooling over the Antarctic

13:57.440 --> 14:01.120
continental interior has likely been caused by both ozone

14:01.120 --> 14:06.080
depletion and greenhouse gas increases. Now that's a clear distinction between

14:06.080 --> 14:10.000
global warming now and global warming during deglaciations

14:10.000 --> 14:14.320
of the past. Firstly, ozone depletion over Antarctica

14:14.320 --> 14:18.160
is not something known to have occurred or been a factor at the end of each

14:18.200 --> 14:22.320
deglaciation. Secondly, while greenhouse gases are the

14:22.320 --> 14:25.840
initial forcing now, during deglaciation periods the

14:25.840 --> 14:31.360
initial forcing was increased insulation, as other studies I've cited explain. And

14:31.360 --> 14:35.200
the third difference, which wasn't in the Schindel and Schmidt paper but which has

14:35.200 --> 14:39.120
been shown in other studies, is that during deglaciations the

14:39.120 --> 14:42.560
initial forcing was insulation in the southern hemisphere,

14:42.560 --> 14:47.280
much closer to Antarctica. Now the initial forcing is CO2 in the

14:47.280 --> 14:51.600
northern hemisphere, much further away. So of course

14:51.600 --> 14:56.720
Antarctica is responding differently. Not to mention the fact that 100 years is

14:56.720 --> 15:00.320
a long period in terms of the warming we're experiencing now,

15:00.320 --> 15:04.400
but a very short time period in terms of glacial cycles.

15:04.400 --> 15:08.400
It's been understood for a long time that if the feedback is greater than the

15:08.400 --> 15:11.040
signal, it will go out of control and there's no

15:11.040 --> 15:15.040
way to stop it. He's claiming that the feedback is much

15:15.040 --> 15:19.440
larger than the driver or a gain of much larger than one.

15:19.440 --> 15:23.120
If that was true there would be no way to stop it once you start it down into

15:23.120 --> 15:26.720
an ice age or just keep getting colder and colder until the whole Earth was

15:26.720 --> 15:29.520
covered with ice and there'd be no way to get back out

15:29.520 --> 15:32.160
of it. Well of course I'm not claiming this.

15:32.160 --> 15:36.160
Researchers are claiming it and they've shown all their evidence in published

15:36.160 --> 15:40.240
papers for Tony or anyone else to read and learn the scientific

15:40.240 --> 15:44.400
explanation. I have to admit though I had exactly the

15:44.400 --> 15:48.160
same question years ago when I started doing videos about this.

15:48.160 --> 15:52.000
I would have agreed with Tony. It didn't make much sense to me.

15:52.000 --> 15:55.440
But instead of assuming the science must be wrong and therefore it's

15:55.440 --> 15:59.280
deliberately faked, I assumed that maybe these professional

15:59.280 --> 16:03.680
researchers knew something I didn't. I always find that the easiest way to

16:03.680 --> 16:05.680
get an answer when you don't know something

16:05.680 --> 16:09.360
is to simply ask. So I asked some climatologists

16:09.360 --> 16:13.360
and the answer turned out to be surprisingly easy.

16:13.360 --> 16:18.080
Once the initial forcing stops, positive feedback has diminishing returns.

16:18.080 --> 16:21.680
It's a bit like a child pushing himself on a swing.

16:21.680 --> 16:25.920
He can go higher and higher as long as he's giving a bit of a kick with his

16:25.920 --> 16:29.600
legs. But if he stops doing that and just sits

16:29.600 --> 16:34.320
there, in other words the forcing stops, then the swing will keep swinging but

16:34.320 --> 16:37.280
with a smaller and smaller amplitude each time

16:37.280 --> 16:42.240
until it finally comes to a stop. On top of that a basic principle of

16:42.240 --> 16:46.720
thermodynamics comes into effect which I've explained in my videos. The

16:46.720 --> 16:49.120
positive feedback doesn't go on forever of course

16:49.120 --> 16:53.360
because as the temperature of the earth rises it radiates more heat.

16:53.360 --> 16:57.280
So once the initial forcing has stopped the temperature keeps rising

16:57.280 --> 17:01.120
until the amount of heat leaving the earth balances the amount of heat coming

17:01.120 --> 17:04.640
in. The earth then stabilises at a higher

17:04.640 --> 17:08.240
temperature called the equilibrium temperature.

17:08.240 --> 17:12.400
Another good question is what happens if the forcing doesn't stop?

17:12.400 --> 17:17.360
What if it goes on forever? But of course every forcing eventually stops.

17:17.360 --> 17:21.360
No flood basalt event which caused CO2 release in the past

17:21.360 --> 17:26.000
goes on forever. Milankovitch cycles never go in one direction forever

17:26.000 --> 17:30.640
that's why they're called cycles. So it's not a question of whether the

17:30.640 --> 17:34.320
forcing will stop but obviously the longer the forcing goes

17:34.320 --> 17:38.400
on the higher the final equilibrium temperature will be.

17:38.400 --> 17:42.000
The off-sided claim that methane is a potent greenhouse gas

17:42.000 --> 17:45.040
simply isn't true. Well that's very easy to check.

17:45.040 --> 17:49.360
Just read the studies. Here's one that measured the spectral absorption of

17:49.360 --> 17:52.960
methane and found that although methane overlaps water vapor

17:52.960 --> 17:57.200
in the 3.3 micrometer band it fills windows in the spectrum in the

17:57.200 --> 18:02.480
1.6 and 2.3 micrometer bands. Their measurements show that the

18:02.480 --> 18:05.760
increase in methane concentration since 1750

18:05.760 --> 18:08.960
has therefore led to a net radiative forcing of about

18:08.960 --> 18:14.240
0.61 watts per square meter. Numerous other studies also contradict

18:14.240 --> 18:17.600
Tony's belief that methane is not a greenhouse gas.

18:17.600 --> 18:21.920
They show it has an estimated global warming potential of around 30 times

18:21.920 --> 18:25.440
that of carbon dioxide. I checked back in the scientific

18:25.440 --> 18:29.440
literature and this has been known for over four decades.

18:29.440 --> 18:33.840
Methane is only two parts per million in the atmosphere. But as any scientist

18:33.840 --> 18:36.400
will tell you just because something is small in

18:36.400 --> 18:40.560
quantity doesn't mean it has a correspondingly small effect.

18:40.560 --> 18:45.440
If you don't agree try ingesting just 0.06 percent of your body weight in

18:45.440 --> 18:49.040
strychnine and see what effect that has. The layer

18:49.040 --> 18:53.120
of ozone in the stratosphere makes up a tiny percentage of the gases in the

18:53.120 --> 18:56.320
atmosphere but without it plants and animals would

18:56.320 --> 19:01.040
fry under ultraviolet light. Scientists judge the efficacy of a

19:01.040 --> 19:03.680
chemical by measuring the effect of a given

19:03.680 --> 19:07.600
quantity not by assuming that because the quantity is small

19:07.600 --> 19:11.280
it can't have any effect. And it's very unstable.

19:11.280 --> 19:15.360
It oxidizes into carbon dioxide and water very quickly.

19:15.360 --> 19:19.520
No, it takes 12 years for half of a given amount of methane to break down into

19:19.520 --> 19:23.920
CO2 and water. So if a ton of methane is released then

19:23.920 --> 19:26.640
as a rule of thumb half a ton will still be in the

19:26.640 --> 19:30.560
atmosphere after 12 years. A quarter of a ton will still be there

19:30.560 --> 19:35.040
after 24 years and so on. That's why the global warming

19:35.040 --> 19:38.240
potential of methane is given according to the length of

19:38.240 --> 19:43.120
time being measured. Again this isn't my theory. This is what

19:43.120 --> 19:46.000
studies over the last 40 years have found.

19:46.000 --> 19:50.240
There's no way to get a large buildup of methane in an atmosphere which contains

19:50.240 --> 19:53.680
a significant amount of oxygen. It just can't happen.

19:53.680 --> 19:57.120
And yet here it is. Not only does it happen

19:57.120 --> 20:01.920
but researchers can measure it. The amount is increasing as human activity

20:01.920 --> 20:07.120
and positive feedback produce more of it. The concentration has more than doubled

20:07.120 --> 20:11.120
from 750 parts per billion in pre-industrial times

20:11.120 --> 20:17.040
to around 1800 parts per billion today. So although it's not as long-lived as

20:17.040 --> 20:20.000
carbon dioxide it's sticking around long enough to have

20:20.000 --> 20:23.600
an increasing impact which is why so much research is being

20:23.600 --> 20:27.360
done on its effects. Geologists are also estimating its

20:27.360 --> 20:32.160
impact on past warming. So let's review everything Potholer did

20:32.160 --> 20:36.400
wrong. Yes this should be fun and we'll put my responses in there to

20:36.400 --> 20:40.640
sum up. First he made the baseless claim that whatever drives ice ages

20:40.640 --> 20:44.800
is very small even though he didn't know what the mechanism was.

20:44.800 --> 20:48.480
A strong contender has always been regular cyclical deviation in the Earth's

20:48.480 --> 20:51.520
position or orbit changing the amount of sunlight the

20:51.520 --> 20:56.160
Earth received. The most likely trigger was the Milankovitch cycles changes in

20:56.160 --> 21:00.080
the Earth's tilt and orbit that caused more insulation. Then he stated the

21:00.080 --> 21:04.560
outrageous claim that a huge amount of feedback on top of a tiny signal is what

21:04.560 --> 21:09.360
was driving ice age descent and ascent. He didn't provide any

21:09.360 --> 21:12.400
evidence for that. A paper by Laureus et al shows that

21:12.400 --> 21:16.320
insulation has varied by only 0.7 watts per square meter

21:16.320 --> 21:20.480
over the last 160,000 years. Climatologists agree that the amount of

21:20.480 --> 21:24.320
forcing from the Earth's changing orbit, thought to be the initial trigger for

21:24.320 --> 21:27.760
deglaciation, had nowhere near enough energy to thaw

21:27.760 --> 21:30.320
ice covering a large portion of the planet.

21:30.320 --> 21:34.080
And as I showed you the climate sensitivity that would be necessary for

21:34.080 --> 21:37.120
that to occur is about 10 times higher than even the

21:37.120 --> 21:41.600
most extreme IPCC estimates of climate sensitivity. But as we

21:41.600 --> 21:44.800
saw Tony got that absurdly high sensitivity

21:44.800 --> 21:48.640
by looking at a graph he got off the internet without checking the data it

21:48.640 --> 21:51.440
came from and without noticing that these are

21:51.440 --> 21:56.000
Antarctic temperatures, not global averages. And he then compared

21:56.000 --> 22:00.880
that with actual sensitivity estimates which do use global averages. Then I

22:00.880 --> 22:04.960
showed you using feedback theory that the feedback has to be smaller than the

22:04.960 --> 22:07.840
signal. Otherwise the climate would be unstable

22:07.840 --> 22:11.760
and Earth would either be like Venus or it'd be snowball Earth. But what you

22:11.760 --> 22:15.520
didn't understand is that this would only be true as long as the forcing

22:15.520 --> 22:19.200
continues. Once the forcing stops, positive feedback

22:19.200 --> 22:24.160
has diminishing returns. In addition, outgoing energy rises as the

22:24.160 --> 22:28.160
temperature of the Earth increases, bringing us to a higher equilibrium

22:28.160 --> 22:32.960
temperature, as I explained in my videos. Then I showed you how his teeter-totter

22:32.960 --> 22:36.480
diagram was unsupportable because it suddenly hit the ground and

22:36.480 --> 22:41.040
stopped, but he never defined what the ground was. The basic laws of

22:41.040 --> 22:45.040
physics tell us that the Earth will heat up in response to this extra energy

22:45.040 --> 22:48.480
and the temperature will keep rising until the increased amount of energy

22:48.480 --> 22:51.840
radiated out matches the amount coming in, what's

22:51.840 --> 22:55.120
called equilibrium. The temperature will eventually

22:55.120 --> 22:58.880
stabilize at a higher level. Then he made claims about methane which

22:58.880 --> 23:02.720
are unsupportable. Well it's supported by 40 years of solid

23:02.720 --> 23:06.000
scientific research and all the studies I've cited which

23:06.000 --> 23:08.480
have measured methane's global warming potential,

23:08.480 --> 23:12.240
its longevity and its increasing presence in the atmosphere.

23:12.240 --> 23:15.440
And methane is very unstable. You can't build up

23:15.440 --> 23:18.960
large amounts of methane in the atmosphere. And as direct measurements

23:18.960 --> 23:23.120
clearly show, yes you can.
