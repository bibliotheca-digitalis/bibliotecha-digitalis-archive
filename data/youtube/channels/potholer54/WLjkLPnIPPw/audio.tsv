0	3680	My thanks to Tony Heller for checking my channel for accuracy
3680	8560	in his video Debunking the Debunker. A lot of people ask me to respond,
8560	13760	so I'm happy to do so. I'll go through his claims in chronological order.
13760	18800	Here's the first one. He claims that a tiny bit of cooling triggers ice ages
18800	23440	and a tiny bit of warming ends them. Well the researchers I cite conclude this,
23440	27280	not me. But he doesn't provide any evidence of the magnitude of these
27280	31920	changes. Actually I do. I not only give the figures, I cite and
31920	37040	show the study they came from. This is from my video Does CO2 Lead or
37040	40960	Lag Global Warming? A paper by Lorius et al shows that
40960	44880	insulation has varied by only 0.7 watts per square meter
44880	50080	over the last 160,000 years. In other words, the tiny amount of forcing due to
50080	53600	the Earth's orbit wasn't enough to defrost miles of thick
53600	59360	ice covering a large part of the planet. Listen carefully to what he says here.
59360	63200	But each time something had to act as that initial trigger.
63200	66880	Something had to nudge the round weight just a fraction.
66880	70640	A strong contender has always been regular cyclical deviation in the Earth's
70640	73600	position or orbit, changing the amount of sunlight the
73600	77280	Earth received. Whatever it was, in the depths of the ice
77280	80240	age this change melted a tiny part of the ice sheet
80320	84080	and released carbon gases from the soil and from the warmer oceans.
84080	88720	Whatever it was, he doesn't actually know what the trigger of the ice ages is, but
88720	91600	he claims to know that the magnitude of it is small.
91600	94960	But didn't I just explain what researchers think it was?
94960	98800	Tony even played the clip. A strong contender has always been regular
98800	101920	cyclical deviation in the Earth's position or orbit,
101920	106080	changing the amount of sunlight the Earth received. These orbital movements
106080	108800	and wobbles are called Milankovitch cycles.
108800	113520	In another video I explain that again. Researchers say carbon dioxide was not
113520	117760	the cause of the initial warming during any of the recent deglaciations.
117760	120960	The most likely trigger was the Milankovitch cycles,
120960	125200	changes in the Earth's tilt and orbit that caused more insulation.
125200	128640	What if the effect of those orbital cycles was actually very large?
128640	132800	Then his entire theory goes down the drain immediately. But as I point out,
132800	136080	researchers have calculated that they aren't large.
136080	140400	And again, it's not my theory. Professional researchers know very
140400	143680	precisely what these orbital variations are,
143680	147040	and they can calculate within given margins of error
147040	150480	how much they affect the energy budget of the Earth.
150480	154400	Of course, Tony can speculate that it's much bigger or much smaller.
154400	159280	He's free to imagine any figures he likes. But researchers can't do that.
159280	162880	They have to go with what the measurements and calculations show.
162880	166240	And as a science reporter, I can't do that either.
166240	169440	I have to accurately report their results.
169440	172800	Tony goes on to describe how a small amount of warming
172800	177520	causes oceans to release CO2, since carbon dioxide is less soluble at
177520	182400	higher water temperature. I explain exactly the same thing, so no
182400	185840	argument there. So the relationship here, as Potholler
185840	189600	correctly stated, is that CO2 follows temperature.
189680	193840	Temperature changes first, and the CO2 changes later.
193840	198400	What he blew over in his discussion was that Al Gore said the exact opposite.
198400	201680	He tried to make it sound like CO2 drove the temperature.
201680	205680	He did indeed, and I pointed out his mistake very clearly.
205680	209920	In his film An Inconvenient Truth, Al Gore used a graph like this to show a
209920	212400	correlation between carbon dioxide levels
212400	216160	and increased temperatures. But he obscured the fact that the carbon
216160	220160	dioxide increases lag the temperature increases by 800
220160	223520	years. So I didn't blow over this at all. It's
223520	226240	right there. Billions of school children around the
226240	230560	world have been lied to about this topic, and Potholler didn't seem to think that
230560	234640	was very important. Now that's a bit unfair. I think that's
234640	237840	extremely important, and if you'd asked me, Tony, I would have
237840	241840	been very happy to tell you that. I've made no indication in any of my
241840	245680	videos that I'm not concerned about children being misinformed about
245680	248880	science, whether it's by Al Gore or Laurie David
248880	252560	or anyone else. I've frequently spoken out in my videos
252560	256320	about the need to stop junk science creeping into classrooms,
256320	260960	and I'm happy to repeat that now. I've also said schools need to spend more
260960	264400	time teaching children how to tell the difference between real
264400	269920	science and junk science on the internet. But let's just get back to what Tony
269920	274080	claims I agree with. So the relationship here, as Potholler
274080	277840	correctly stated, is that CO2 follows temperature.
277840	281600	Temperature changes first, and the CO2 changes later.
281600	285680	Well I didn't say the relationship here is that CO2 follows temperature,
285680	290160	obviously, because this is a graph covering several glacial cycles.
290160	294000	What I said was that CO2 followed temperatures in the early stages of
294000	297520	deglaciation in the southern hemisphere, because I'm
297520	300400	reporting the conclusion of scientific studies.
300400	303920	In the latter stages of deglaciation shown on the graph,
303920	308160	and in the northern hemisphere, CO2 led temperature rise.
308160	312000	So just as it's wrong for Al Gore to give the impression that CO2 always
312000	316320	leads temperature changes, it's wrong for Tony to give the impression that CO2
316320	320080	always lags. If Tony's concerned that billions of
320080	323120	school children are being lied to about this topic,
323120	327840	and I don't doubt his sincerity, then I hope he'll join me in insisting that
327840	331040	school children should be told what the science says,
331040	334400	which is that carbon dioxide does both. It leads
334400	338880	and lags temperature at different stages in the glacial cycle.
338880	342160	Now let's go back and look at the ice core graph again.
342160	346320	The graph shows swings in temperature of about 10 degrees centigrade
346320	351440	during glacial cycles. These correspond with swings in carbon dioxide level in
351440	355440	the atmosphere of about 100 parts per million. Now
355440	358880	remember what Potholler said. He said that a very small change in
358880	362080	temperature causes feedback from carbon dioxide,
362080	365120	and that we get a 10 degree swing in temperature
365120	368640	from a 100 part per million change in CO2.
368640	372640	Does anyone remember me saying that we get a 10 degree swing in temperature
372640	376160	from a 100 part per million change in CO2?
376160	380480	No, because that would imply a ridiculously high figure for the Earth's
380480	383440	sensitivity, which is how much the Earth responds
383440	388000	to carbon dioxide forcing. Did Tony show a video clip of me saying
388000	391280	that? Of course not, because I never said any
391280	395440	such thing. And yet when Tony made that claim, some
395440	399440	people simply believed him without checking. That's why I got a
399440	403200	couple of rather abusive messages on my channel.
403200	407680	And that is completely ludicrous. It is, which is why I didn't say it.
407680	412400	Not even the most outrageous claims of climate sensitivity come anywhere close to that level.
412400	416640	I didn't say that, Tony. Okay, just to settle this, here's what I
416640	420720	did say about climate sensitivity. And these estimates show that for a
420720	424480	doubling of CO2 concentrations, we should see a rise in global
424480	428400	temperatures of between 2 and 4.5 degrees.
428400	432080	Now that's what I've reported, so what does Tony Heller say?
432080	435840	According to the United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate
435840	438240	Change, climate sensitivity is somewhere
438240	443840	between 1.5 degrees centigrade and 4.5 degrees centigrade for a
443840	447840	doubling of CO2. So it turns out Tony agrees with my
447840	452080	reporting of the sensitivity estimates. There's a reason for the small half a
452080	457520	degree difference in the lower estimate, but this is essentially the same result.
457520	460720	So I didn't say that a 10 degree rise in temperature
460720	464080	came from a 100 part per million rise in CO2.
464080	467680	And certainly no study I've ever read has made such a claim,
467680	471600	or given that interpretation to the data used to make the graph.
471600	475600	Tony Heller assumed that that's what the graph shows, because he made a basic
475600	478800	error when he tried to interpret the graph for himself.
478800	482960	To find out what he got wrong, we first need to find out where he got this graph
482960	486080	from. Tony doesn't tell us because he
486080	490640	doesn't give his sources, so I had to track it down myself. It's
490640	494720	been passed around the internet a lot, but by searching the image and
494720	499280	screening the time it was first uploaded, I finally found the first posting of it
499360	502880	from a slideshow, and that led me to this slide presentation
502880	505920	at Harvard. The data for the graph, according to the
505920	509680	authors, came from this paper by Petit et al.
509680	513280	Reading Petit's paper, which gives us more detail about how the data were
513280	515920	gathered, it's clear that the temperature scale on
515920	519840	Tony's graph is not measuring average global temperature.
519840	524560	The authors measured oxygen isotopes in the air bubbles trapped in the ice,
524560	527680	which are good proxies for air temperatures. So,
527680	532400	as they explain in the study, they're measuring temperature at two places,
532400	536560	where the precipitation formed, in other words, where the snowflakes formed,
536560	540800	and where the snowflakes fell and were later compressed into ice.
540800	545120	To put it in even simpler terms, they weren't measuring global temperatures at
545120	547360	all. They were measuring Antarctic
547360	550960	temperatures. So, Tony's wrong to infer climate
550960	554560	sensitivity from this, because climate sensitivity is based on
554560	558160	average global temperatures, like the average global temperatures
558160	562000	Tony looked at when he cites the IPCC result.
562000	565040	I'm sure everyone understands the difference between these
565040	570400	average global temperature figures and these Antarctic temperature figures.
570400	574480	Under potholars feedback theory, not my theory mate, we would have expected that
574480	578560	as CO2 spiked, temperatures would have gone up too. Okay,
578560	582240	there's obviously a genuine belief that this is my theory,
582240	586080	so I'd better explain that the conclusion that post-glacial warming was
586080	591520	amplified by positive feedback is a well-accepted scientific principle.
591520	595440	Anyone with a passing interest in climate science would surely be aware
595440	598640	of the mountainous studies that have been written about it.
598640	601920	I've explained these positive feedback factors many times,
601920	606480	citing scientific studies. So, if anyone thinks it's my theory,
606480	610800	I'm very flattered, but I'm not nearly smart enough to have discovered it,
610800	614800	so please read these studies for yourselves. And it isn't a recent
614800	617760	phenomenon invented by fraudulent scientists.
617760	623840	Positive feedback as a forcing amplifier has been understood since at least 1969,
623840	627840	when Charles Keating of the Scripps Institute wrote about it.
627840	631040	This summary explains positive feedback very well,
631040	636320	published in 1979. So, to answer the question of whether temperature goes up,
636320	641760	after CO2 goes up, yes, researchers have shown that it clearly does.
641760	646320	What Tony is wondering is why, therefore, don't temperatures keep rising
646320	651440	when CO2 hits its peak? We would have expected that as CO2 spiked,
651440	655840	temperatures would have gone up too. Well, when something doesn't make any sense to
655840	658160	me, I don't assume that the science must be
658160	662480	wrong. I try to find out if professional researchers have an answer.
662480	667360	And of course they do. What researchers have found is that towards the end of
667360	671040	each deglaciation, the forcing stops and the Earth reaches
671040	676720	what's called equilibrium temperature. It enters an interglacial. Now, negative
676720	681120	forcing takes effect. The most likely reason for this change is
681120	684880	the Milankovitch cycles. As the southern hemisphere receives a
684880	689440	little less insulation, the oceans cool, dissolving more CO2,
689440	693120	which reduces CO2 concentration in the atmosphere.
693120	697440	And colder conditions create more ice, increasing albedo
697440	702560	and reflecting more sunlight. It's the reverse of what happens at the start of
702560	707280	a deglaciation. Look how quickly we come out of ice ages,
707280	713040	starting with very low levels of CO2. This is the exact opposite of what we'd
713040	716560	expect from CO2 theory. Of course, you only need to read the
716640	720880	published studies to see that these observations aren't the opposite.
720880	724400	They're completely consistent. To recap briefly,
724400	728720	the research shows that a small increase in insulation warms the oceans
728720	732160	and that causes CO2 to come out of solution.
732160	735360	Now, if CO2 wasn't a powerful greenhouse gas,
735360	738800	that would be the end of the line. Research has shown that the small
738800	742560	increase in insulation alone wouldn't be enough to melt all the ice
742560	745600	sheets. So there would be no way to explain how
745600	751040	each glaciation came to an end. But if CO2 is a powerful greenhouse gas,
751040	754480	then the result would be more warming, amplified by positive
754480	758720	feedback, bringing us quickly out of the glaciation.
758720	762800	So how can this process be the opposite of the theory that CO2 is a powerful
762800	765840	greenhouse gas when the entire sequence of events
765840	770320	depends on it? In 2004, the guy who's in charge of
770320	773600	temperature records at NASA, Gavin Schmidt, said
773680	778400	during recent decades, surface temperatures decreased significantly over
778400	782000	most of Antarctica. Let's remember now that we're talking
782000	786240	about Antarctic ice core records. Gavin Schmidt says the temperature is
786240	792400	going down as CO2 has spiked. Under pothole's feedback theory, not my
792400	795840	theory mate, you would have expected that as CO2 spiked,
795840	799520	temperatures would have gone up too. Okay, a lot of assumptions and
799520	803360	misunderstandings here. The problem seems to be that Tony's only
803360	806640	reading the abstract of the study on a NASA website.
806640	810640	He needs to read the paper itself, where the source of his misunderstanding is
810640	814320	revealed. In the paper itself, the authors show
814320	818720	that ozone depletion and greenhouse gases exacerbated a
818720	821440	phenomenon called the southern annular mode,
821440	826640	or the SAM, which defines the changing position of the southern wind belt.
826640	830400	According to the study, 90 percent of the cooling at South Pole and East
830400	834480	Antarctica stations correlated to the SAM, so their
834480	837440	conclusion was that recent cooling over the Antarctic
837440	841120	continental interior has likely been caused by both ozone
841120	846080	depletion and greenhouse gas increases. Now that's a clear distinction between
846080	850000	global warming now and global warming during deglaciations
850000	854320	of the past. Firstly, ozone depletion over Antarctica
854320	858160	is not something known to have occurred or been a factor at the end of each
858200	862320	deglaciation. Secondly, while greenhouse gases are the
862320	865840	initial forcing now, during deglaciation periods the
865840	871360	initial forcing was increased insulation, as other studies I've cited explain. And
871360	875200	the third difference, which wasn't in the Schindel and Schmidt paper but which has
875200	879120	been shown in other studies, is that during deglaciations the
879120	882560	initial forcing was insulation in the southern hemisphere,
882560	887280	much closer to Antarctica. Now the initial forcing is CO2 in the
887280	891600	northern hemisphere, much further away. So of course
891600	896720	Antarctica is responding differently. Not to mention the fact that 100 years is
896720	900320	a long period in terms of the warming we're experiencing now,
900320	904400	but a very short time period in terms of glacial cycles.
904400	908400	It's been understood for a long time that if the feedback is greater than the
908400	911040	signal, it will go out of control and there's no
911040	915040	way to stop it. He's claiming that the feedback is much
915040	919440	larger than the driver or a gain of much larger than one.
919440	923120	If that was true there would be no way to stop it once you start it down into
923120	926720	an ice age or just keep getting colder and colder until the whole Earth was
926720	929520	covered with ice and there'd be no way to get back out
929520	932160	of it. Well of course I'm not claiming this.
932160	936160	Researchers are claiming it and they've shown all their evidence in published
936160	940240	papers for Tony or anyone else to read and learn the scientific
940240	944400	explanation. I have to admit though I had exactly the
944400	948160	same question years ago when I started doing videos about this.
948160	952000	I would have agreed with Tony. It didn't make much sense to me.
952000	955440	But instead of assuming the science must be wrong and therefore it's
955440	959280	deliberately faked, I assumed that maybe these professional
959280	963680	researchers knew something I didn't. I always find that the easiest way to
963680	965680	get an answer when you don't know something
965680	969360	is to simply ask. So I asked some climatologists
969360	973360	and the answer turned out to be surprisingly easy.
973360	978080	Once the initial forcing stops, positive feedback has diminishing returns.
978080	981680	It's a bit like a child pushing himself on a swing.
981680	985920	He can go higher and higher as long as he's giving a bit of a kick with his
985920	989600	legs. But if he stops doing that and just sits
989600	994320	there, in other words the forcing stops, then the swing will keep swinging but
994320	997280	with a smaller and smaller amplitude each time
997280	1002240	until it finally comes to a stop. On top of that a basic principle of
1002240	1006720	thermodynamics comes into effect which I've explained in my videos. The
1006720	1009120	positive feedback doesn't go on forever of course
1009120	1013360	because as the temperature of the earth rises it radiates more heat.
1013360	1017280	So once the initial forcing has stopped the temperature keeps rising
1017280	1021120	until the amount of heat leaving the earth balances the amount of heat coming
1021120	1024640	in. The earth then stabilises at a higher
1024640	1028240	temperature called the equilibrium temperature.
1028240	1032400	Another good question is what happens if the forcing doesn't stop?
1032400	1037360	What if it goes on forever? But of course every forcing eventually stops.
1037360	1041360	No flood basalt event which caused CO2 release in the past
1041360	1046000	goes on forever. Milankovitch cycles never go in one direction forever
1046000	1050640	that's why they're called cycles. So it's not a question of whether the
1050640	1054320	forcing will stop but obviously the longer the forcing goes
1054320	1058400	on the higher the final equilibrium temperature will be.
1058400	1062000	The off-sided claim that methane is a potent greenhouse gas
1062000	1065040	simply isn't true. Well that's very easy to check.
1065040	1069360	Just read the studies. Here's one that measured the spectral absorption of
1069360	1072960	methane and found that although methane overlaps water vapor
1072960	1077200	in the 3.3 micrometer band it fills windows in the spectrum in the
1077200	1082480	1.6 and 2.3 micrometer bands. Their measurements show that the
1082480	1085760	increase in methane concentration since 1750
1085760	1088960	has therefore led to a net radiative forcing of about
1088960	1094240	0.61 watts per square meter. Numerous other studies also contradict
1094240	1097600	Tony's belief that methane is not a greenhouse gas.
1097600	1101920	They show it has an estimated global warming potential of around 30 times
1101920	1105440	that of carbon dioxide. I checked back in the scientific
1105440	1109440	literature and this has been known for over four decades.
1109440	1113840	Methane is only two parts per million in the atmosphere. But as any scientist
1113840	1116400	will tell you just because something is small in
1116400	1120560	quantity doesn't mean it has a correspondingly small effect.
1120560	1125440	If you don't agree try ingesting just 0.06 percent of your body weight in
1125440	1129040	strychnine and see what effect that has. The layer
1129040	1133120	of ozone in the stratosphere makes up a tiny percentage of the gases in the
1133120	1136320	atmosphere but without it plants and animals would
1136320	1141040	fry under ultraviolet light. Scientists judge the efficacy of a
1141040	1143680	chemical by measuring the effect of a given
1143680	1147600	quantity not by assuming that because the quantity is small
1147600	1151280	it can't have any effect. And it's very unstable.
1151280	1155360	It oxidizes into carbon dioxide and water very quickly.
1155360	1159520	No, it takes 12 years for half of a given amount of methane to break down into
1159520	1163920	CO2 and water. So if a ton of methane is released then
1163920	1166640	as a rule of thumb half a ton will still be in the
1166640	1170560	atmosphere after 12 years. A quarter of a ton will still be there
1170560	1175040	after 24 years and so on. That's why the global warming
1175040	1178240	potential of methane is given according to the length of
1178240	1183120	time being measured. Again this isn't my theory. This is what
1183120	1186000	studies over the last 40 years have found.
1186000	1190240	There's no way to get a large buildup of methane in an atmosphere which contains
1190240	1193680	a significant amount of oxygen. It just can't happen.
1193680	1197120	And yet here it is. Not only does it happen
1197120	1201920	but researchers can measure it. The amount is increasing as human activity
1201920	1207120	and positive feedback produce more of it. The concentration has more than doubled
1207120	1211120	from 750 parts per billion in pre-industrial times
1211120	1217040	to around 1800 parts per billion today. So although it's not as long-lived as
1217040	1220000	carbon dioxide it's sticking around long enough to have
1220000	1223600	an increasing impact which is why so much research is being
1223600	1227360	done on its effects. Geologists are also estimating its
1227360	1232160	impact on past warming. So let's review everything Potholer did
1232160	1236400	wrong. Yes this should be fun and we'll put my responses in there to
1236400	1240640	sum up. First he made the baseless claim that whatever drives ice ages
1240640	1244800	is very small even though he didn't know what the mechanism was.
1244800	1248480	A strong contender has always been regular cyclical deviation in the Earth's
1248480	1251520	position or orbit changing the amount of sunlight the
1251520	1256160	Earth received. The most likely trigger was the Milankovitch cycles changes in
1256160	1260080	the Earth's tilt and orbit that caused more insulation. Then he stated the
1260080	1264560	outrageous claim that a huge amount of feedback on top of a tiny signal is what
1264560	1269360	was driving ice age descent and ascent. He didn't provide any
1269360	1272400	evidence for that. A paper by Laureus et al shows that
1272400	1276320	insulation has varied by only 0.7 watts per square meter
1276320	1280480	over the last 160,000 years. Climatologists agree that the amount of
1280480	1284320	forcing from the Earth's changing orbit, thought to be the initial trigger for
1284320	1287760	deglaciation, had nowhere near enough energy to thaw
1287760	1290320	ice covering a large portion of the planet.
1290320	1294080	And as I showed you the climate sensitivity that would be necessary for
1294080	1297120	that to occur is about 10 times higher than even the
1297120	1301600	most extreme IPCC estimates of climate sensitivity. But as we
1301600	1304800	saw Tony got that absurdly high sensitivity
1304800	1308640	by looking at a graph he got off the internet without checking the data it
1308640	1311440	came from and without noticing that these are
1311440	1316000	Antarctic temperatures, not global averages. And he then compared
1316000	1320880	that with actual sensitivity estimates which do use global averages. Then I
1320880	1324960	showed you using feedback theory that the feedback has to be smaller than the
1324960	1327840	signal. Otherwise the climate would be unstable
1327840	1331760	and Earth would either be like Venus or it'd be snowball Earth. But what you
1331760	1335520	didn't understand is that this would only be true as long as the forcing
1335520	1339200	continues. Once the forcing stops, positive feedback
1339200	1344160	has diminishing returns. In addition, outgoing energy rises as the
1344160	1348160	temperature of the Earth increases, bringing us to a higher equilibrium
1348160	1352960	temperature, as I explained in my videos. Then I showed you how his teeter-totter
1352960	1356480	diagram was unsupportable because it suddenly hit the ground and
1356480	1361040	stopped, but he never defined what the ground was. The basic laws of
1361040	1365040	physics tell us that the Earth will heat up in response to this extra energy
1365040	1368480	and the temperature will keep rising until the increased amount of energy
1368480	1371840	radiated out matches the amount coming in, what's
1371840	1375120	called equilibrium. The temperature will eventually
1375120	1378880	stabilize at a higher level. Then he made claims about methane which
1378880	1382720	are unsupportable. Well it's supported by 40 years of solid
1382720	1386000	scientific research and all the studies I've cited which
1386000	1388480	have measured methane's global warming potential,
1388480	1392240	its longevity and its increasing presence in the atmosphere.
1392240	1395440	And methane is very unstable. You can't build up
1395440	1398960	large amounts of methane in the atmosphere. And as direct measurements
1398960	1403120	clearly show, yes you can.
