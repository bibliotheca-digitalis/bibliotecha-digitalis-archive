1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,520
I can't keep up. While I was uploading this catalogue of errors on Steve Crowder's website

2
00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:11,520
in my last video, I mean literally while it was being uploaded, I noticed Team Crowder posted

3
00:00:11,520 --> 00:00:16,400
yet another one. Well, at least this time they can't be blamed for not checking with the source

4
00:00:16,400 --> 00:00:22,400
because this time their source isn't a blog or a tabloid newspaper. It's the actual statement by

5
00:00:22,400 --> 00:00:27,840
the Swiss National Science Foundation which funded research by several scientific organisations.

6
00:00:27,840 --> 00:00:34,320
The PMOD which led the study, the EAWAG, ETH Zurich and the University of Bern.

7
00:00:35,440 --> 00:00:39,840
So there's no fact checking to be done, the facts are right there in front of them.

8
00:00:39,840 --> 00:00:45,280
All they had to do was copy them. And this time they can't be excused for not understanding the

9
00:00:45,280 --> 00:00:50,720
complicated scientific jargon because it's not a scientific paper, it's a statement written in

10
00:00:50,720 --> 00:00:56,560
just plain English. So what on earth went wrong? Well let's start with an easy one,

11
00:00:56,560 --> 00:01:01,600
the very second paragraph of the statement begins, there is human induced climate change

12
00:01:01,600 --> 00:01:07,520
and there are natural climate fluctuations. But Team Crowder thinks the statement concludes,

13
00:01:07,520 --> 00:01:11,280
when it comes to fluctuations in global temperatures, the sun is to blame.

14
00:01:12,480 --> 00:01:17,920
No, the statement says nothing of the sort, nowhere in the entire text. It says climate

15
00:01:17,920 --> 00:01:23,760
change is due to human induced climate change and natural climate fluctuations, which of course is

16
00:01:23,760 --> 00:01:28,720
what every other researcher in the field says. And one of those natural climate fluctuations

17
00:01:28,720 --> 00:01:35,200
is the sun. But that kind of misrepresentation is easy, Team Crowder is just making something up and

18
00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:39,440
hoping no one notices. What they do next is far more subtle.

19
00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:46,960
First Team Crowder quotes verbatim from the SNSF statement, they, that's the researchers,

20
00:01:46,960 --> 00:01:51,840
expect the earth's temperature to fall by half a degree when solar activity reaches its next

21
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:59,280
minimum. Yes, that is in the SNSF statement and it looks pretty cast iron. So Team Crowder feels

22
00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:04,720
it can confidently tell us that the earth is poised to not get warmer but a little cooler,

23
00:02:04,720 --> 00:02:09,680
the climate cools as the sun cools. Then if we scroll down,

24
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:19,280
a bit further, okay stop, go back. Right there, Team Crowder tells us that climate

25
00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:25,040
changes are already rushing to decry this new information. Typical climate changes.

26
00:02:25,600 --> 00:02:30,560
Because good news for the planet is bad news for idiots who want to feel relevant by blaming

27
00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:36,160
humanity for having the power to affect the planet's climate. So who's the example they

28
00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:42,080
give of an idiot climate changer decrying this new information? According to the example they

29
00:02:42,080 --> 00:02:48,800
showed, some guy called Werner Schmutz, head of some project or other. According to the project

30
00:02:48,880 --> 00:02:53,520
head Werner Schmutz, this reduction in temperature is significant even though it will do little to

31
00:02:53,520 --> 00:02:59,600
compensate for human-induced climate change. So again Team Crowder seems to be right. As soon as

32
00:02:59,600 --> 00:03:04,400
the scientist publishes a study clearly showing that we're in for a period of global cooling,

33
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:09,760
some idiot climate changer decries it with a claim that it's going to be overwhelmed by man-made

34
00:03:09,760 --> 00:03:17,120
global warming. So who is this Werner Schmutz? Well, if we look to see where the quote comes

35
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:22,720
from it turns out a crucial piece of identifying information has been cut by Team Crowder.

36
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:31,120
The original quote identifies Werner Schmutz as director of PMOD. Hang on, isn't that one

37
00:03:31,120 --> 00:03:36,720
of the scientific institutes that did the study? Now that's odd. Is the director of the PMOD

38
00:03:36,720 --> 00:03:41,840
refuting the conclusions of his own researchers? And if so, why did Team Crowder remove the

39
00:03:41,840 --> 00:03:48,400
reference? Well, it turns out that Werner Schmutz, the idiot climate changer who apparently decries

40
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:56,000
the SNSF study, is the same Werner Schmutz who was lead author of the SNSF study. That's because the

41
00:03:56,000 --> 00:04:02,240
quote Team Crowder lifted explaining that warming will continue came from the same place in the SNSF

42
00:04:02,240 --> 00:04:08,400
statement as their earlier quote about solar cooling. Here they are as originally written

43
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:14,160
in the SNSF statement. Wow, you guys went to a lot of trouble to mix this up.

44
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:20,560
So from the top the SNSF is not saying the sun is to blame for fluctuations in the climate,

45
00:04:21,200 --> 00:04:26,720
it's saying it's one factor. Man-made climate change, in other words carbon dioxide,

46
00:04:26,720 --> 00:04:32,960
is another. And they're saying that of the two, man-made climate change is more powerful and will

47
00:04:32,960 --> 00:04:38,480
overwhelm a small amount of cooling due to lower solar output over the next 50 to 100 years.

48
00:04:39,200 --> 00:04:44,000
This small amount of cooling won't stop global warming, it won't reverse global warming, but it

49
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:48,880
might reduce it a little. Schmutz spells out the conclusion, the same conclusion of other

50
00:04:48,880 --> 00:04:54,080
researchers who've studied future solar output by the way, that despite lower solar output the world

51
00:04:54,080 --> 00:05:01,440
will still continue warming because of human-induced climate change. So once again Team Crowder is

52
00:05:01,440 --> 00:05:06,800
claiming that the conclusion of the researchers is the complete opposite to what they clearly

53
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:12,480
stated. I've linked the Crowder blog and the statement in my video description so everything's

54
00:05:12,480 --> 00:05:18,560
open for you to check for yourselves. Okay now to Steve's response on the forum of my last video.

55
00:05:19,120 --> 00:05:24,000
Once again Steve you say I've got some things wrong and some things right and once again you've

56
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:29,840
invited me onto your show, presumably to talk about the things you think I got wrong. So once

57
00:05:29,840 --> 00:05:35,680
again I've asked you to tell me what those things are so that we have something to discuss and once

58
00:05:35,680 --> 00:05:40,960
again you won't say. Instead you give enigmatic responses like this on your Twitter feed.

59
00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:46,960
But what if he's misrepresenting both our evidence and conclusions? Oh come on, that's being more

60
00:05:46,960 --> 00:05:52,160
coy than a flirty teenager. What if I asked you out? What would you say? Are you asking me out?

61
00:05:52,160 --> 00:05:56,720
What if I was? I don't know, depends if you're asking. Oh for goodness sake Steve, we're grown-ups.

62
00:05:56,720 --> 00:06:02,640
Did I misrepresent your evidence and conclusions or not? What if I did? Well then the solution is

63
00:06:02,640 --> 00:06:08,640
very easy and it's in your hands. Tell everyone openly what I've misrepresented and let's debate

64
00:06:08,640 --> 00:06:14,080
it. This doesn't have to be done live in order to be open. To be open it just has to be done on a

65
00:06:14,080 --> 00:06:19,920
public forum. I've invited you to debate any of my corrections that you can test openly so that

66
00:06:19,920 --> 00:06:26,080
everyone can read and check the evidence we both present. This doesn't have to be done on your

67
00:06:26,080 --> 00:06:31,360
channel or mine if that's what's stopping you. It could be done on any website. Anyone want to set

68
00:06:31,360 --> 00:06:37,360
one up? I'll lay out my case and upload all the papers and all the evidence for everyone to read.

69
00:06:37,360 --> 00:06:42,960
Then you can respond and present your evidence in rebuttal for everyone to read. A free and open

70
00:06:42,960 --> 00:06:48,240
debate where each side, including the audience, has the chance to read and check all the evidence

71
00:06:48,240 --> 00:06:53,920
we present. I'm reading the sources you provided so all we have to do is compare what you think

72
00:06:53,920 --> 00:07:00,160
the source says to what the source actually says. Shouldn't take long. Your excuse is that you're

73
00:07:00,160 --> 00:07:06,720
too busy to debate in an open forum but to be fair you've got an entire team on your side and time to

74
00:07:06,720 --> 00:07:13,360
send me an email and post two lengthy responses on my video fora and several tweets so surely you can

75
00:07:13,360 --> 00:07:19,280
find the time to do this. As for debating this on your show as we both know I'm still waiting for

76
00:07:19,280 --> 00:07:26,160
you to decide on a topic which you won't do. I'm not asking you to give away your arguments. All I

77
00:07:26,160 --> 00:07:31,440
want to establish is what we're going to talk about. Your producer Jared said it could be a

78
00:07:31,440 --> 00:07:36,720
discussion of our differences which is fine but if you won't tell me which of my corrections are

79
00:07:36,720 --> 00:07:42,320
valid and which ones aren't then I don't know what these differences are. I think six months

80
00:07:42,320 --> 00:07:48,480
of asking you is long enough so I had an idea. I figured that since you haven't corrected or

81
00:07:48,480 --> 00:07:54,960
redacted any of these claims on your website it's fair to assume you stand by all of them and since

82
00:07:54,960 --> 00:08:00,320
you won't choose which claim you want to debate I'll pick one for you. So let's go with the one

83
00:08:00,320 --> 00:08:05,520
I focused on in my last video the claim that NASA says fossil fuels cause global cooling.

84
00:08:06,160 --> 00:08:11,360
I know you didn't write this but it's on your website and under your name so I presume you

85
00:08:11,360 --> 00:08:16,560
approved it and after I exposed the errors you must have checked it and decided it needs to stay

86
00:08:16,560 --> 00:08:22,240
up there. You have a huge advantage over me because you've seen the evidence I'm going to present

87
00:08:22,240 --> 00:08:28,240
and you have plenty of time to prepare. To make sure I'm not misrepresenting your conclusion it's

88
00:08:28,240 --> 00:08:35,120
right here. Your claim is that this NASA study concludes that fossil fuels cause temporary global

89
00:08:35,120 --> 00:08:42,240
cooling not global warming. You still stand by that claim? Okay then we're good. I found a moderator

90
00:08:42,240 --> 00:08:48,000
as you suggested Richard Jones a YouTuber who invited me to take part in a charitable quiz a

91
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:53,280
few years back. I've never met him but he did a great technical job in arranging a three-screen

92
00:08:53,280 --> 00:08:58,640
live broadcast of that event which is exactly what we need and he's agreed to set this up.

93
00:08:59,200 --> 00:09:04,480
He's done a lot of videos promoting atheism but don't hold that against him. Our discussion isn't

94
00:09:04,480 --> 00:09:09,600
about religion. He'll make sure we each get a fair hearing, don't shout over one another

95
00:09:10,160 --> 00:09:16,320
or refuse to cite our sources. Here's the email I sent him suggesting what I hope you'll agree

96
00:09:16,320 --> 00:09:22,320
are very fair guidelines. By the way ignore number four because that was written when you were still

97
00:09:22,320 --> 00:09:27,840
refusing to give a topic for the debate. I've chosen one for you. I know it sucks having

98
00:09:27,840 --> 00:09:32,800
guidelines but we are having a debate about science which entails things like citing papers

99
00:09:32,800 --> 00:09:38,560
and showing evidence in line with our shared belief that everything should be always open.

100
00:09:38,560 --> 00:09:43,520
I'm so glad you agree with that. And of course the guidelines ensure we stay focused on the

101
00:09:43,520 --> 00:09:49,600
topic of debate rather than side tracking. But that doesn't mean it can't be fun. Neither of us

102
00:09:49,600 --> 00:09:54,880
is taking our differences personally and you've been very civil throughout our dialogue. Thanks.

103
00:09:54,880 --> 00:09:59,600
So let's try to shed some light on the facts rather than just generate a lot of heat with

104
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:04,800
opinion. The other stumbling block to going on your show was the 12-hour time difference

105
00:10:04,800 --> 00:10:10,080
but since you generously offered to let me choose the time then that should no longer be an issue.

106
00:10:10,080 --> 00:10:16,240
Thanks very much for being flexible on that. And finally as I said I'm on the road until September

107
00:10:16,240 --> 00:10:20,960
so any on-air discussion will have to wait until then. For the next four months I'm

108
00:10:20,960 --> 00:10:26,560
traveling with an unpredictable schedule and trying to cope with weak wi-fi in a variety of hotels.

109
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:32,240
In the meantime there's nothing to stop us debating any of your other claims online

110
00:10:32,240 --> 00:10:37,920
in the open so everyone can see your evidence and my evidence. How about making the topic of

111
00:10:37,920 --> 00:10:42,720
that debate? Team Crowder's claimed that this statement by the Swiss National Science Foundation

112
00:10:42,720 --> 00:10:48,480
says their research shows that the sun regulates the climate and that the SNSF says we're headed

113
00:10:48,480 --> 00:10:55,200
for global cooling. That should be fun. If Team Crowder or some kind soul can set up a website

114
00:10:55,200 --> 00:11:00,400
where we can debate this we can get started. I've been trying to get you to debate your claims for

115
00:11:00,400 --> 00:11:07,200
six months Steve. I know your excuse for avoiding this debate is that you're all too busy. Well let's see.
