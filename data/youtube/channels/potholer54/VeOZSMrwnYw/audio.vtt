00:00.000 --> 00:05.520
I can't keep up. While I was uploading this catalogue of errors on Steve Crowder's website

00:05.520 --> 00:11.520
in my last video, I mean literally while it was being uploaded, I noticed Team Crowder posted

00:11.520 --> 00:16.400
yet another one. Well, at least this time they can't be blamed for not checking with the source

00:16.400 --> 00:22.400
because this time their source isn't a blog or a tabloid newspaper. It's the actual statement by

00:22.400 --> 00:27.840
the Swiss National Science Foundation which funded research by several scientific organisations.

00:27.840 --> 00:34.320
The PMOD which led the study, the EAWAG, ETH Zurich and the University of Bern.

00:35.440 --> 00:39.840
So there's no fact checking to be done, the facts are right there in front of them.

00:39.840 --> 00:45.280
All they had to do was copy them. And this time they can't be excused for not understanding the

00:45.280 --> 00:50.720
complicated scientific jargon because it's not a scientific paper, it's a statement written in

00:50.720 --> 00:56.560
just plain English. So what on earth went wrong? Well let's start with an easy one,

00:56.560 --> 01:01.600
the very second paragraph of the statement begins, there is human induced climate change

01:01.600 --> 01:07.520
and there are natural climate fluctuations. But Team Crowder thinks the statement concludes,

01:07.520 --> 01:11.280
when it comes to fluctuations in global temperatures, the sun is to blame.

01:12.480 --> 01:17.920
No, the statement says nothing of the sort, nowhere in the entire text. It says climate

01:17.920 --> 01:23.760
change is due to human induced climate change and natural climate fluctuations, which of course is

01:23.760 --> 01:28.720
what every other researcher in the field says. And one of those natural climate fluctuations

01:28.720 --> 01:35.200
is the sun. But that kind of misrepresentation is easy, Team Crowder is just making something up and

01:35.200 --> 01:39.440
hoping no one notices. What they do next is far more subtle.

01:40.560 --> 01:46.960
First Team Crowder quotes verbatim from the SNSF statement, they, that's the researchers,

01:46.960 --> 01:51.840
expect the earth's temperature to fall by half a degree when solar activity reaches its next

01:51.840 --> 01:59.280
minimum. Yes, that is in the SNSF statement and it looks pretty cast iron. So Team Crowder feels

01:59.280 --> 02:04.720
it can confidently tell us that the earth is poised to not get warmer but a little cooler,

02:04.720 --> 02:09.680
the climate cools as the sun cools. Then if we scroll down,

02:12.000 --> 02:19.280
a bit further, okay stop, go back. Right there, Team Crowder tells us that climate

02:19.280 --> 02:25.040
changes are already rushing to decry this new information. Typical climate changes.

02:25.600 --> 02:30.560
Because good news for the planet is bad news for idiots who want to feel relevant by blaming

02:30.560 --> 02:36.160
humanity for having the power to affect the planet's climate. So who's the example they

02:36.160 --> 02:42.080
give of an idiot climate changer decrying this new information? According to the example they

02:42.080 --> 02:48.800
showed, some guy called Werner Schmutz, head of some project or other. According to the project

02:48.880 --> 02:53.520
head Werner Schmutz, this reduction in temperature is significant even though it will do little to

02:53.520 --> 02:59.600
compensate for human-induced climate change. So again Team Crowder seems to be right. As soon as

02:59.600 --> 03:04.400
the scientist publishes a study clearly showing that we're in for a period of global cooling,

03:04.400 --> 03:09.760
some idiot climate changer decries it with a claim that it's going to be overwhelmed by man-made

03:09.760 --> 03:17.120
global warming. So who is this Werner Schmutz? Well, if we look to see where the quote comes

03:17.120 --> 03:22.720
from it turns out a crucial piece of identifying information has been cut by Team Crowder.

03:23.280 --> 03:31.120
The original quote identifies Werner Schmutz as director of PMOD. Hang on, isn't that one

03:31.120 --> 03:36.720
of the scientific institutes that did the study? Now that's odd. Is the director of the PMOD

03:36.720 --> 03:41.840
refuting the conclusions of his own researchers? And if so, why did Team Crowder remove the

03:41.840 --> 03:48.400
reference? Well, it turns out that Werner Schmutz, the idiot climate changer who apparently decries

03:48.400 --> 03:56.000
the SNSF study, is the same Werner Schmutz who was lead author of the SNSF study. That's because the

03:56.000 --> 04:02.240
quote Team Crowder lifted explaining that warming will continue came from the same place in the SNSF

04:02.240 --> 04:08.400
statement as their earlier quote about solar cooling. Here they are as originally written

04:08.400 --> 04:14.160
in the SNSF statement. Wow, you guys went to a lot of trouble to mix this up.

04:15.120 --> 04:20.560
So from the top the SNSF is not saying the sun is to blame for fluctuations in the climate,

04:21.200 --> 04:26.720
it's saying it's one factor. Man-made climate change, in other words carbon dioxide,

04:26.720 --> 04:32.960
is another. And they're saying that of the two, man-made climate change is more powerful and will

04:32.960 --> 04:38.480
overwhelm a small amount of cooling due to lower solar output over the next 50 to 100 years.

04:39.200 --> 04:44.000
This small amount of cooling won't stop global warming, it won't reverse global warming, but it

04:44.000 --> 04:48.880
might reduce it a little. Schmutz spells out the conclusion, the same conclusion of other

04:48.880 --> 04:54.080
researchers who've studied future solar output by the way, that despite lower solar output the world

04:54.080 --> 05:01.440
will still continue warming because of human-induced climate change. So once again Team Crowder is

05:01.440 --> 05:06.800
claiming that the conclusion of the researchers is the complete opposite to what they clearly

05:06.800 --> 05:12.480
stated. I've linked the Crowder blog and the statement in my video description so everything's

05:12.480 --> 05:18.560
open for you to check for yourselves. Okay now to Steve's response on the forum of my last video.

05:19.120 --> 05:24.000
Once again Steve you say I've got some things wrong and some things right and once again you've

05:24.000 --> 05:29.840
invited me onto your show, presumably to talk about the things you think I got wrong. So once

05:29.840 --> 05:35.680
again I've asked you to tell me what those things are so that we have something to discuss and once

05:35.680 --> 05:40.960
again you won't say. Instead you give enigmatic responses like this on your Twitter feed.

05:41.600 --> 05:46.960
But what if he's misrepresenting both our evidence and conclusions? Oh come on, that's being more

05:46.960 --> 05:52.160
coy than a flirty teenager. What if I asked you out? What would you say? Are you asking me out?

05:52.160 --> 05:56.720
What if I was? I don't know, depends if you're asking. Oh for goodness sake Steve, we're grown-ups.

05:56.720 --> 06:02.640
Did I misrepresent your evidence and conclusions or not? What if I did? Well then the solution is

06:02.640 --> 06:08.640
very easy and it's in your hands. Tell everyone openly what I've misrepresented and let's debate

06:08.640 --> 06:14.080
it. This doesn't have to be done live in order to be open. To be open it just has to be done on a

06:14.080 --> 06:19.920
public forum. I've invited you to debate any of my corrections that you can test openly so that

06:19.920 --> 06:26.080
everyone can read and check the evidence we both present. This doesn't have to be done on your

06:26.080 --> 06:31.360
channel or mine if that's what's stopping you. It could be done on any website. Anyone want to set

06:31.360 --> 06:37.360
one up? I'll lay out my case and upload all the papers and all the evidence for everyone to read.

06:37.360 --> 06:42.960
Then you can respond and present your evidence in rebuttal for everyone to read. A free and open

06:42.960 --> 06:48.240
debate where each side, including the audience, has the chance to read and check all the evidence

06:48.240 --> 06:53.920
we present. I'm reading the sources you provided so all we have to do is compare what you think

06:53.920 --> 07:00.160
the source says to what the source actually says. Shouldn't take long. Your excuse is that you're

07:00.160 --> 07:06.720
too busy to debate in an open forum but to be fair you've got an entire team on your side and time to

07:06.720 --> 07:13.360
send me an email and post two lengthy responses on my video fora and several tweets so surely you can

07:13.360 --> 07:19.280
find the time to do this. As for debating this on your show as we both know I'm still waiting for

07:19.280 --> 07:26.160
you to decide on a topic which you won't do. I'm not asking you to give away your arguments. All I

07:26.160 --> 07:31.440
want to establish is what we're going to talk about. Your producer Jared said it could be a

07:31.440 --> 07:36.720
discussion of our differences which is fine but if you won't tell me which of my corrections are

07:36.720 --> 07:42.320
valid and which ones aren't then I don't know what these differences are. I think six months

07:42.320 --> 07:48.480
of asking you is long enough so I had an idea. I figured that since you haven't corrected or

07:48.480 --> 07:54.960
redacted any of these claims on your website it's fair to assume you stand by all of them and since

07:54.960 --> 08:00.320
you won't choose which claim you want to debate I'll pick one for you. So let's go with the one

08:00.320 --> 08:05.520
I focused on in my last video the claim that NASA says fossil fuels cause global cooling.

08:06.160 --> 08:11.360
I know you didn't write this but it's on your website and under your name so I presume you

08:11.360 --> 08:16.560
approved it and after I exposed the errors you must have checked it and decided it needs to stay

08:16.560 --> 08:22.240
up there. You have a huge advantage over me because you've seen the evidence I'm going to present

08:22.240 --> 08:28.240
and you have plenty of time to prepare. To make sure I'm not misrepresenting your conclusion it's

08:28.240 --> 08:35.120
right here. Your claim is that this NASA study concludes that fossil fuels cause temporary global

08:35.120 --> 08:42.240
cooling not global warming. You still stand by that claim? Okay then we're good. I found a moderator

08:42.240 --> 08:48.000
as you suggested Richard Jones a YouTuber who invited me to take part in a charitable quiz a

08:48.000 --> 08:53.280
few years back. I've never met him but he did a great technical job in arranging a three-screen

08:53.280 --> 08:58.640
live broadcast of that event which is exactly what we need and he's agreed to set this up.

08:59.200 --> 09:04.480
He's done a lot of videos promoting atheism but don't hold that against him. Our discussion isn't

09:04.480 --> 09:09.600
about religion. He'll make sure we each get a fair hearing, don't shout over one another

09:10.160 --> 09:16.320
or refuse to cite our sources. Here's the email I sent him suggesting what I hope you'll agree

09:16.320 --> 09:22.320
are very fair guidelines. By the way ignore number four because that was written when you were still

09:22.320 --> 09:27.840
refusing to give a topic for the debate. I've chosen one for you. I know it sucks having

09:27.840 --> 09:32.800
guidelines but we are having a debate about science which entails things like citing papers

09:32.800 --> 09:38.560
and showing evidence in line with our shared belief that everything should be always open.

09:38.560 --> 09:43.520
I'm so glad you agree with that. And of course the guidelines ensure we stay focused on the

09:43.520 --> 09:49.600
topic of debate rather than side tracking. But that doesn't mean it can't be fun. Neither of us

09:49.600 --> 09:54.880
is taking our differences personally and you've been very civil throughout our dialogue. Thanks.

09:54.880 --> 09:59.600
So let's try to shed some light on the facts rather than just generate a lot of heat with

09:59.600 --> 10:04.800
opinion. The other stumbling block to going on your show was the 12-hour time difference

10:04.800 --> 10:10.080
but since you generously offered to let me choose the time then that should no longer be an issue.

10:10.080 --> 10:16.240
Thanks very much for being flexible on that. And finally as I said I'm on the road until September

10:16.240 --> 10:20.960
so any on-air discussion will have to wait until then. For the next four months I'm

10:20.960 --> 10:26.560
traveling with an unpredictable schedule and trying to cope with weak wi-fi in a variety of hotels.

10:28.000 --> 10:32.240
In the meantime there's nothing to stop us debating any of your other claims online

10:32.240 --> 10:37.920
in the open so everyone can see your evidence and my evidence. How about making the topic of

10:37.920 --> 10:42.720
that debate? Team Crowder's claimed that this statement by the Swiss National Science Foundation

10:42.720 --> 10:48.480
says their research shows that the sun regulates the climate and that the SNSF says we're headed

10:48.480 --> 10:55.200
for global cooling. That should be fun. If Team Crowder or some kind soul can set up a website

10:55.200 --> 11:00.400
where we can debate this we can get started. I've been trying to get you to debate your claims for

11:00.400 --> 11:07.200
six months Steve. I know your excuse for avoiding this debate is that you're all too busy. Well let's see.
