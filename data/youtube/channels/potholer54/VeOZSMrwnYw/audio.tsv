0	5520	I can't keep up. While I was uploading this catalogue of errors on Steve Crowder's website
5520	11520	in my last video, I mean literally while it was being uploaded, I noticed Team Crowder posted
11520	16400	yet another one. Well, at least this time they can't be blamed for not checking with the source
16400	22400	because this time their source isn't a blog or a tabloid newspaper. It's the actual statement by
22400	27840	the Swiss National Science Foundation which funded research by several scientific organisations.
27840	34320	The PMOD which led the study, the EAWAG, ETH Zurich and the University of Bern.
35440	39840	So there's no fact checking to be done, the facts are right there in front of them.
39840	45280	All they had to do was copy them. And this time they can't be excused for not understanding the
45280	50720	complicated scientific jargon because it's not a scientific paper, it's a statement written in
50720	56560	just plain English. So what on earth went wrong? Well let's start with an easy one,
56560	61600	the very second paragraph of the statement begins, there is human induced climate change
61600	67520	and there are natural climate fluctuations. But Team Crowder thinks the statement concludes,
67520	71280	when it comes to fluctuations in global temperatures, the sun is to blame.
72480	77920	No, the statement says nothing of the sort, nowhere in the entire text. It says climate
77920	83760	change is due to human induced climate change and natural climate fluctuations, which of course is
83760	88720	what every other researcher in the field says. And one of those natural climate fluctuations
88720	95200	is the sun. But that kind of misrepresentation is easy, Team Crowder is just making something up and
95200	99440	hoping no one notices. What they do next is far more subtle.
100560	106960	First Team Crowder quotes verbatim from the SNSF statement, they, that's the researchers,
106960	111840	expect the earth's temperature to fall by half a degree when solar activity reaches its next
111840	119280	minimum. Yes, that is in the SNSF statement and it looks pretty cast iron. So Team Crowder feels
119280	124720	it can confidently tell us that the earth is poised to not get warmer but a little cooler,
124720	129680	the climate cools as the sun cools. Then if we scroll down,
132000	139280	a bit further, okay stop, go back. Right there, Team Crowder tells us that climate
139280	145040	changes are already rushing to decry this new information. Typical climate changes.
145600	150560	Because good news for the planet is bad news for idiots who want to feel relevant by blaming
150560	156160	humanity for having the power to affect the planet's climate. So who's the example they
156160	162080	give of an idiot climate changer decrying this new information? According to the example they
162080	168800	showed, some guy called Werner Schmutz, head of some project or other. According to the project
168880	173520	head Werner Schmutz, this reduction in temperature is significant even though it will do little to
173520	179600	compensate for human-induced climate change. So again Team Crowder seems to be right. As soon as
179600	184400	the scientist publishes a study clearly showing that we're in for a period of global cooling,
184400	189760	some idiot climate changer decries it with a claim that it's going to be overwhelmed by man-made
189760	197120	global warming. So who is this Werner Schmutz? Well, if we look to see where the quote comes
197120	202720	from it turns out a crucial piece of identifying information has been cut by Team Crowder.
203280	211120	The original quote identifies Werner Schmutz as director of PMOD. Hang on, isn't that one
211120	216720	of the scientific institutes that did the study? Now that's odd. Is the director of the PMOD
216720	221840	refuting the conclusions of his own researchers? And if so, why did Team Crowder remove the
221840	228400	reference? Well, it turns out that Werner Schmutz, the idiot climate changer who apparently decries
228400	236000	the SNSF study, is the same Werner Schmutz who was lead author of the SNSF study. That's because the
236000	242240	quote Team Crowder lifted explaining that warming will continue came from the same place in the SNSF
242240	248400	statement as their earlier quote about solar cooling. Here they are as originally written
248400	254160	in the SNSF statement. Wow, you guys went to a lot of trouble to mix this up.
255120	260560	So from the top the SNSF is not saying the sun is to blame for fluctuations in the climate,
261200	266720	it's saying it's one factor. Man-made climate change, in other words carbon dioxide,
266720	272960	is another. And they're saying that of the two, man-made climate change is more powerful and will
272960	278480	overwhelm a small amount of cooling due to lower solar output over the next 50 to 100 years.
279200	284000	This small amount of cooling won't stop global warming, it won't reverse global warming, but it
284000	288880	might reduce it a little. Schmutz spells out the conclusion, the same conclusion of other
288880	294080	researchers who've studied future solar output by the way, that despite lower solar output the world
294080	301440	will still continue warming because of human-induced climate change. So once again Team Crowder is
301440	306800	claiming that the conclusion of the researchers is the complete opposite to what they clearly
306800	312480	stated. I've linked the Crowder blog and the statement in my video description so everything's
312480	318560	open for you to check for yourselves. Okay now to Steve's response on the forum of my last video.
319120	324000	Once again Steve you say I've got some things wrong and some things right and once again you've
324000	329840	invited me onto your show, presumably to talk about the things you think I got wrong. So once
329840	335680	again I've asked you to tell me what those things are so that we have something to discuss and once
335680	340960	again you won't say. Instead you give enigmatic responses like this on your Twitter feed.
341600	346960	But what if he's misrepresenting both our evidence and conclusions? Oh come on, that's being more
346960	352160	coy than a flirty teenager. What if I asked you out? What would you say? Are you asking me out?
352160	356720	What if I was? I don't know, depends if you're asking. Oh for goodness sake Steve, we're grown-ups.
356720	362640	Did I misrepresent your evidence and conclusions or not? What if I did? Well then the solution is
362640	368640	very easy and it's in your hands. Tell everyone openly what I've misrepresented and let's debate
368640	374080	it. This doesn't have to be done live in order to be open. To be open it just has to be done on a
374080	379920	public forum. I've invited you to debate any of my corrections that you can test openly so that
379920	386080	everyone can read and check the evidence we both present. This doesn't have to be done on your
386080	391360	channel or mine if that's what's stopping you. It could be done on any website. Anyone want to set
391360	397360	one up? I'll lay out my case and upload all the papers and all the evidence for everyone to read.
397360	402960	Then you can respond and present your evidence in rebuttal for everyone to read. A free and open
402960	408240	debate where each side, including the audience, has the chance to read and check all the evidence
408240	413920	we present. I'm reading the sources you provided so all we have to do is compare what you think
413920	420160	the source says to what the source actually says. Shouldn't take long. Your excuse is that you're
420160	426720	too busy to debate in an open forum but to be fair you've got an entire team on your side and time to
426720	433360	send me an email and post two lengthy responses on my video fora and several tweets so surely you can
433360	439280	find the time to do this. As for debating this on your show as we both know I'm still waiting for
439280	446160	you to decide on a topic which you won't do. I'm not asking you to give away your arguments. All I
446160	451440	want to establish is what we're going to talk about. Your producer Jared said it could be a
451440	456720	discussion of our differences which is fine but if you won't tell me which of my corrections are
456720	462320	valid and which ones aren't then I don't know what these differences are. I think six months
462320	468480	of asking you is long enough so I had an idea. I figured that since you haven't corrected or
468480	474960	redacted any of these claims on your website it's fair to assume you stand by all of them and since
474960	480320	you won't choose which claim you want to debate I'll pick one for you. So let's go with the one
480320	485520	I focused on in my last video the claim that NASA says fossil fuels cause global cooling.
486160	491360	I know you didn't write this but it's on your website and under your name so I presume you
491360	496560	approved it and after I exposed the errors you must have checked it and decided it needs to stay
496560	502240	up there. You have a huge advantage over me because you've seen the evidence I'm going to present
502240	508240	and you have plenty of time to prepare. To make sure I'm not misrepresenting your conclusion it's
508240	515120	right here. Your claim is that this NASA study concludes that fossil fuels cause temporary global
515120	522240	cooling not global warming. You still stand by that claim? Okay then we're good. I found a moderator
522240	528000	as you suggested Richard Jones a YouTuber who invited me to take part in a charitable quiz a
528000	533280	few years back. I've never met him but he did a great technical job in arranging a three-screen
533280	538640	live broadcast of that event which is exactly what we need and he's agreed to set this up.
539200	544480	He's done a lot of videos promoting atheism but don't hold that against him. Our discussion isn't
544480	549600	about religion. He'll make sure we each get a fair hearing, don't shout over one another
550160	556320	or refuse to cite our sources. Here's the email I sent him suggesting what I hope you'll agree
556320	562320	are very fair guidelines. By the way ignore number four because that was written when you were still
562320	567840	refusing to give a topic for the debate. I've chosen one for you. I know it sucks having
567840	572800	guidelines but we are having a debate about science which entails things like citing papers
572800	578560	and showing evidence in line with our shared belief that everything should be always open.
578560	583520	I'm so glad you agree with that. And of course the guidelines ensure we stay focused on the
583520	589600	topic of debate rather than side tracking. But that doesn't mean it can't be fun. Neither of us
589600	594880	is taking our differences personally and you've been very civil throughout our dialogue. Thanks.
594880	599600	So let's try to shed some light on the facts rather than just generate a lot of heat with
599600	604800	opinion. The other stumbling block to going on your show was the 12-hour time difference
604800	610080	but since you generously offered to let me choose the time then that should no longer be an issue.
610080	616240	Thanks very much for being flexible on that. And finally as I said I'm on the road until September
616240	620960	so any on-air discussion will have to wait until then. For the next four months I'm
620960	626560	traveling with an unpredictable schedule and trying to cope with weak wi-fi in a variety of hotels.
628000	632240	In the meantime there's nothing to stop us debating any of your other claims online
632240	637920	in the open so everyone can see your evidence and my evidence. How about making the topic of
637920	642720	that debate? Team Crowder's claimed that this statement by the Swiss National Science Foundation
642720	648480	says their research shows that the sun regulates the climate and that the SNSF says we're headed
648480	655200	for global cooling. That should be fun. If Team Crowder or some kind soul can set up a website
655200	660400	where we can debate this we can get started. I've been trying to get you to debate your claims for
660400	667200	six months Steve. I know your excuse for avoiding this debate is that you're all too busy. Well let's see.
