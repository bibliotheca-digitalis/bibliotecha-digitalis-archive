00:00.000 --> 00:04.600
I don't know if anyone has seen the headlines recently, but all the newspapers are talking

00:04.600 --> 00:10.140
about a new study published in Nature which looked at our planet's ice loss from 2003

00:10.140 --> 00:11.980
to 2010.

00:11.980 --> 00:14.180
Earth loses huge amounts of ice.

00:14.180 --> 00:18.820
Scientists say 4.3 trillion tonnes of ice melted in just eight years.

00:18.820 --> 00:22.780
Nearly 150 cubic miles of ice being lost every year.

00:22.780 --> 00:24.740
You didn't see these headlines?

00:24.740 --> 00:29.420
Well hardly surprising, because although this is what the study showed, this isn't what

00:29.840 --> 00:33.060
headline editors have been running recently.

00:33.060 --> 00:37.560
It's headlines like this that have been repeated ad nauseam and have now become the latest

00:37.560 --> 00:40.040
mantra in the war against science.

00:40.040 --> 00:41.560
What's their source?

00:41.560 --> 00:44.200
Well it's this paper in Nature.

00:44.200 --> 00:47.140
Hang on, isn't that the same paper?

00:47.140 --> 00:50.480
How can the same paper say two completely different things?

00:50.480 --> 00:51.800
There's no ice melt.

00:51.800 --> 00:53.360
There's a huge amount of ice melt.

00:53.360 --> 00:54.920
Which is it?

00:54.920 --> 00:58.940
Well let me try to unravel it by doing something most journalists covering this story clearly

00:59.480 --> 01:00.480
haven't done.

01:00.480 --> 01:02.560
Read the paper itself.

01:02.560 --> 01:07.000
The researchers wanted to quantify the melt rate of glaciers and ice caps around the world

01:07.000 --> 01:09.600
outside of Greenland and Antarctica.

01:09.600 --> 01:14.140
So they used a satellite program called GRACE, which measures gravitational attraction over

01:14.140 --> 01:16.160
different parts of the Earth.

01:16.160 --> 01:20.560
Where ice is melting, there's less gravitational attraction, and where it's gaining, there's

01:20.560 --> 01:21.560
more.

01:21.560 --> 01:26.560
So bluer areas are where ice is melting, the redder areas show ice gain.

01:26.560 --> 01:31.620
And the first thing you'll notice of course are huge areas of blue and very little red.

01:31.620 --> 01:36.980
A massive quantity of ice is melting all over the world, especially rapidly in Patagonia,

01:36.980 --> 01:40.160
Alaska, Iceland and Northern Canada.

01:40.160 --> 01:44.580
But when it came to the Himalayas, they calculated there was very little net loss of ice over

01:44.580 --> 01:46.220
the area as a whole.

01:46.220 --> 01:48.080
Now how can that be?

01:48.080 --> 01:52.940
After all, most studies so far have suggested strong melt of the Himalayan glaciers.

01:52.940 --> 01:56.940
The problem is the only direct measurements have come from accessible glaciers at lower

01:56.940 --> 01:58.120
altitudes.

01:58.120 --> 02:03.340
The rate of melt of high altitude glaciers, which are inaccessible, has either been extrapolated

02:03.340 --> 02:07.040
from these results or measured by remote sensing.

02:07.040 --> 02:10.760
And the Nature Study suggests both methods are flawed.

02:10.760 --> 02:15.680
The nature researchers, on the other hand, could only measure blocks of 100 square kilometres.

02:15.680 --> 02:19.220
They couldn't differentiate between individual glaciers.

02:19.220 --> 02:24.320
So they postulated that melting at lower altitudes is compensated for by ice gain at

02:24.320 --> 02:26.320
higher altitudes.

02:26.320 --> 02:31.080
So the conclusion was that while most glacial areas around the world are melting, high altitude

02:31.080 --> 02:34.640
glaciers, notably in the Himalayas, are not.

02:34.640 --> 02:38.640
One of the researchers, John Warr, suggested by way of explanation,

02:38.640 --> 02:43.400
Unlike the lower glaciers, most of the high glaciers are located in very cold environments

02:43.400 --> 02:48.040
and require greater amounts of atmospheric warming before local temperatures rise enough

02:48.040 --> 02:50.860
to cause significant melting.

02:50.860 --> 02:55.580
As a result of this revised data, the researchers found that the rate of melt from glaciers

02:55.580 --> 03:00.780
and ice caps around the world is about 30% smaller than previously estimated for the

03:00.780 --> 03:01.960
same period.

03:01.960 --> 03:06.320
In other words, about 63 billion tonnes less melted ice.

03:06.320 --> 03:11.340
But while the Himalayas had no net loss, nearly every other glacial area showed significant

03:11.340 --> 03:14.980
loss and so did Greenland and Antarctica.

03:15.000 --> 03:20.720
So how does the revised Himalayan ice loss affect melt rates worldwide?

03:20.720 --> 03:26.520
Well according to the paper, glaciers and ice caps alone accounted for 148 billion tonnes

03:26.520 --> 03:29.960
of melting ice a year over the study period.

03:29.960 --> 03:36.040
Peripheral glaciers and ice caps in Greenland and Antarctica accounted for 81 billion tonnes.

03:36.040 --> 03:41.920
And ice sheets in Greenland and Antarctica accounted for 303 billion tonnes.

03:41.980 --> 03:49.780
That's a total of 532 billion tonnes, or nearly 150 cubic miles of ice melting every year.

03:49.780 --> 03:55.340
Since this is around 63 billion tonnes less than expected, it's a drop of around 10.5%

03:55.340 --> 03:57.380
from what was previously thought.

03:57.380 --> 04:01.660
So the headlines about the Himalayas don't tell the whole story, and in many news articles

04:01.660 --> 04:05.340
the rest of the story was buried much further down.

04:05.340 --> 04:07.220
No further.

04:07.220 --> 04:08.220
There it is.

04:08.220 --> 04:12.680
The study clearly notes that lower altitude glaciers and ice caps are melting to the tune

04:12.680 --> 04:17.660
of about 150 billion tonnes of ice annually, which the study predicts could lead to an

04:17.660 --> 04:20.600
overall rise in sea levels.

04:20.600 --> 04:24.940
But of course most commentators and opinion makers either missed that or decided to completely

04:24.940 --> 04:25.940
ignore it.

04:25.940 --> 04:30.640
Now it's okay to run with this headline because it was a significant piece of news.

04:30.640 --> 04:34.720
For scientists, the fact that the world is warming and ice is rapidly melting is old

04:34.720 --> 04:39.380
news, and indeed the study wasn't supposed to be evidence for global warming, its purpose

04:39.380 --> 04:43.880
was to look at how much sea level rise can be expected from this ice melt.

04:43.880 --> 04:47.660
But for the popular press, the headline has to be balanced with what was shown in the

04:47.660 --> 04:53.020
rest of the study, otherwise it's going to be misunderstood, as it was.

04:53.020 --> 04:57.500
Too many commentators simply looked at the headline and assumed this meant ice isn't

04:57.500 --> 05:00.820
melting and therefore the world can't be warming.

05:00.820 --> 05:03.880
And that ubiquitous ten-year figure is an invention.

05:03.880 --> 05:07.160
The study covered eight years and clearly said so.

05:07.160 --> 05:11.760
But the fact that a ten-year figure has been so widely circulated suggests that journalists

05:11.760 --> 05:17.560
didn't read the paper, but in time-honoured tradition they simply copied off each other.

05:17.560 --> 05:21.040
But there is one silver lining in this catalogue of misreporting.

05:21.040 --> 05:25.740
Normally, when a scientific paper like this comes out, critics of climate science dismiss

05:25.740 --> 05:31.600
it as propaganda, fake figures and dishonest scientists chasing after research grants.

05:31.600 --> 05:35.400
But I'm delighted that in this case they've decided to accept it.

05:35.400 --> 05:36.400
Great!

05:36.400 --> 05:43.480
So they accept that over 1,000 cubic miles of ice melted between 2003 and 2010.

05:43.480 --> 05:48.000
So the next question they have to answer is, what on earth could be causing that?
