0	4600	I don't know if anyone has seen the headlines recently, but all the newspapers are talking
4600	10140	about a new study published in Nature which looked at our planet's ice loss from 2003
10140	11980	to 2010.
11980	14180	Earth loses huge amounts of ice.
14180	18820	Scientists say 4.3 trillion tonnes of ice melted in just eight years.
18820	22780	Nearly 150 cubic miles of ice being lost every year.
22780	24740	You didn't see these headlines?
24740	29420	Well hardly surprising, because although this is what the study showed, this isn't what
29840	33060	headline editors have been running recently.
33060	37560	It's headlines like this that have been repeated ad nauseam and have now become the latest
37560	40040	mantra in the war against science.
40040	41560	What's their source?
41560	44200	Well it's this paper in Nature.
44200	47140	Hang on, isn't that the same paper?
47140	50480	How can the same paper say two completely different things?
50480	51800	There's no ice melt.
51800	53360	There's a huge amount of ice melt.
53360	54920	Which is it?
54920	58940	Well let me try to unravel it by doing something most journalists covering this story clearly
59480	60480	haven't done.
60480	62560	Read the paper itself.
62560	67000	The researchers wanted to quantify the melt rate of glaciers and ice caps around the world
67000	69600	outside of Greenland and Antarctica.
69600	74140	So they used a satellite program called GRACE, which measures gravitational attraction over
74140	76160	different parts of the Earth.
76160	80560	Where ice is melting, there's less gravitational attraction, and where it's gaining, there's
80560	81560	more.
81560	86560	So bluer areas are where ice is melting, the redder areas show ice gain.
86560	91620	And the first thing you'll notice of course are huge areas of blue and very little red.
91620	96980	A massive quantity of ice is melting all over the world, especially rapidly in Patagonia,
96980	100160	Alaska, Iceland and Northern Canada.
100160	104580	But when it came to the Himalayas, they calculated there was very little net loss of ice over
104580	106220	the area as a whole.
106220	108080	Now how can that be?
108080	112940	After all, most studies so far have suggested strong melt of the Himalayan glaciers.
112940	116940	The problem is the only direct measurements have come from accessible glaciers at lower
116940	118120	altitudes.
118120	123340	The rate of melt of high altitude glaciers, which are inaccessible, has either been extrapolated
123340	127040	from these results or measured by remote sensing.
127040	130760	And the Nature Study suggests both methods are flawed.
130760	135680	The nature researchers, on the other hand, could only measure blocks of 100 square kilometres.
135680	139220	They couldn't differentiate between individual glaciers.
139220	144320	So they postulated that melting at lower altitudes is compensated for by ice gain at
144320	146320	higher altitudes.
146320	151080	So the conclusion was that while most glacial areas around the world are melting, high altitude
151080	154640	glaciers, notably in the Himalayas, are not.
154640	158640	One of the researchers, John Warr, suggested by way of explanation,
158640	163400	Unlike the lower glaciers, most of the high glaciers are located in very cold environments
163400	168040	and require greater amounts of atmospheric warming before local temperatures rise enough
168040	170860	to cause significant melting.
170860	175580	As a result of this revised data, the researchers found that the rate of melt from glaciers
175580	180780	and ice caps around the world is about 30% smaller than previously estimated for the
180780	181960	same period.
181960	186320	In other words, about 63 billion tonnes less melted ice.
186320	191340	But while the Himalayas had no net loss, nearly every other glacial area showed significant
191340	194980	loss and so did Greenland and Antarctica.
195000	200720	So how does the revised Himalayan ice loss affect melt rates worldwide?
200720	206520	Well according to the paper, glaciers and ice caps alone accounted for 148 billion tonnes
206520	209960	of melting ice a year over the study period.
209960	216040	Peripheral glaciers and ice caps in Greenland and Antarctica accounted for 81 billion tonnes.
216040	221920	And ice sheets in Greenland and Antarctica accounted for 303 billion tonnes.
221980	229780	That's a total of 532 billion tonnes, or nearly 150 cubic miles of ice melting every year.
229780	235340	Since this is around 63 billion tonnes less than expected, it's a drop of around 10.5%
235340	237380	from what was previously thought.
237380	241660	So the headlines about the Himalayas don't tell the whole story, and in many news articles
241660	245340	the rest of the story was buried much further down.
245340	247220	No further.
247220	248220	There it is.
248220	252680	The study clearly notes that lower altitude glaciers and ice caps are melting to the tune
252680	257660	of about 150 billion tonnes of ice annually, which the study predicts could lead to an
257660	260600	overall rise in sea levels.
260600	264940	But of course most commentators and opinion makers either missed that or decided to completely
264940	265940	ignore it.
265940	270640	Now it's okay to run with this headline because it was a significant piece of news.
270640	274720	For scientists, the fact that the world is warming and ice is rapidly melting is old
274720	279380	news, and indeed the study wasn't supposed to be evidence for global warming, its purpose
279380	283880	was to look at how much sea level rise can be expected from this ice melt.
283880	287660	But for the popular press, the headline has to be balanced with what was shown in the
287660	293020	rest of the study, otherwise it's going to be misunderstood, as it was.
293020	297500	Too many commentators simply looked at the headline and assumed this meant ice isn't
297500	300820	melting and therefore the world can't be warming.
300820	303880	And that ubiquitous ten-year figure is an invention.
303880	307160	The study covered eight years and clearly said so.
307160	311760	But the fact that a ten-year figure has been so widely circulated suggests that journalists
311760	317560	didn't read the paper, but in time-honoured tradition they simply copied off each other.
317560	321040	But there is one silver lining in this catalogue of misreporting.
321040	325740	Normally, when a scientific paper like this comes out, critics of climate science dismiss
325740	331600	it as propaganda, fake figures and dishonest scientists chasing after research grants.
331600	335400	But I'm delighted that in this case they've decided to accept it.
335400	336400	Great!
336400	343480	So they accept that over 1,000 cubic miles of ice melted between 2003 and 2010.
343480	348000	So the next question they have to answer is, what on earth could be causing that?
