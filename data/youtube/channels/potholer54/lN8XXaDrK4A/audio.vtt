00:00.000 --> 00:05.440
Let's try a quick quiz. These pictures show the aftermath of four different disasters

00:05.440 --> 00:08.760
a tornado, an earthquake, a hurricane and a flood

00:08.760 --> 00:13.840
question is which is which? Just pause the video for a second to figure it out

00:13.840 --> 00:18.640
okay not too hard was it? answers will be at the end

00:18.640 --> 00:23.360
what this quiz tells us is something that Bible preacher Kent Hovind

00:23.360 --> 00:25.800
has yet to figure out about the history of the earth

00:30.000 --> 00:33.760
you're right Kent

00:33.760 --> 00:37.960
I wasn't there. The problem is you weren't there either

00:37.960 --> 00:42.640
none of us was there so how can we best work out the earth's history

00:42.640 --> 00:45.880
follow Bronze Age beliefs, follow our hearts

00:45.880 --> 00:49.280
make it up or do what you did with the photos

00:49.280 --> 00:53.480
and look at the clues that these events leave behind. After all

00:53.480 --> 00:57.400
deducing what happened in the past is a process we go through every day

00:57.760 --> 01:01.960
if we weren't there we have to work it out by observation and deduction

01:01.960 --> 01:04.960
each sedimentary rock on earth for example

01:04.960 --> 01:08.800
tells the story of how it was formed and under what conditions

01:08.800 --> 01:12.560
geologists can identify ancient earthquakes and floods

01:12.560 --> 01:17.840
just as you can identify recent ones but this knowledge wasn't gained overnight

01:17.840 --> 01:22.000
for centuries people didn't question the biblical version of creation

01:22.000 --> 01:25.400
but in the 18th century the Age of Enlightenment

01:25.600 --> 01:30.520
curiosity led some leading thinkers to take a closer look at the rocks that God had made

01:30.520 --> 01:34.120
and the more they looked the more things didn't add up

01:34.120 --> 01:38.520
many of the rocks they saw were in layers and made of the sort of material

01:38.520 --> 01:40.240
you'd find at the bottom of the sea

01:40.240 --> 01:43.960
okay but why was some of these sedimentary layers

01:43.960 --> 01:47.840
at odd angles or on mountain tops or bent out of shape

01:47.840 --> 01:50.880
why were the layers made of different materials

01:51.880 --> 01:55.920
underneath the top sedimentary layers the picture got even more complicated

01:55.920 --> 01:59.840
in 1788 the man called the father of geology

01:59.840 --> 02:03.720
James Hutton saw a geological formation that seemed impossible

02:03.720 --> 02:09.200
at Siccar Point in Scotland he found this set of almost horizontal sedimentary beds

02:09.200 --> 02:12.320
sitting directly on top of an almost vertical set

02:12.320 --> 02:15.680
and this formation wasn't unique it's called

02:15.680 --> 02:20.280
an angular unconformity and geologists soon found angular unconformities all

02:20.280 --> 02:21.200
over the place

02:21.200 --> 02:25.440
by the mid 19th century two principles had been established

02:25.440 --> 02:29.720
it was clear that sedimentary beds that were once at the bottom of the sea

02:29.720 --> 02:33.760
must have been uplifted of course the effect of these uplifts

02:33.760 --> 02:38.480
and their opposite number subsidence's are enhanced by the rise and fall of sea

02:38.480 --> 02:39.080
levels

02:39.080 --> 02:44.360
as polar ice caps grow and melt but a rise in sea level alone doesn't explain

02:44.360 --> 02:46.720
how sedimentary rocks can be folded

02:46.880 --> 02:51.400
and lifted several miles high some unseen force was acting on them

02:51.400 --> 02:56.440
once uplifted the rocks are subjected to erosion by wind and water

02:56.440 --> 03:00.280
silt sand and mud are washed into the rivers and out to sea

03:00.280 --> 03:04.720
where they're deposited slowly building up the sedimentary beds that will become the

03:04.720 --> 03:05.880
rocks of the future

03:05.880 --> 03:10.040
so angular unconformities weren't that weird after all

03:10.040 --> 03:14.480
the lower beds were laid down under the sea with material eroded from the land

03:14.920 --> 03:18.840
over time and under pressure water percolated through the deposits

03:18.840 --> 03:21.880
precipitating minerals that cemented the grains together

03:21.880 --> 03:25.200
then the solid beds were lifted up and deformed

03:25.200 --> 03:29.160
now above sea level wind and rain eroded the rocks

03:29.160 --> 03:33.960
forming a soil at the surface after a period of time sea levels rose

03:33.960 --> 03:38.120
and covered the beds once again more sediment was laid on top

03:38.120 --> 03:41.480
and the sea levels fell and the beds were exposed

03:42.360 --> 03:46.120
nearly every feature they'd seen in the rocks of the past can be seen in the

03:46.120 --> 03:48.240
deposits that are being laid down today

03:48.240 --> 03:51.480
showing that this was a long and continual process

03:51.480 --> 03:56.640
that took millions of years so early 19th century geologists had to forget

03:56.640 --> 04:01.120
their preconceived ideas of a 6,500 year old world

04:01.120 --> 04:04.400
and a 4,000 year old flood instead

04:04.400 --> 04:09.800
they followed the evidence but although they understood erosion and sedimentation

04:09.880 --> 04:14.360
the frequent uplifts were a puzzle by observing and analyzing the rocks of the

04:14.360 --> 04:16.360
Appalachians in the 1850s

04:16.360 --> 04:20.360
American geologists deduced that a deep trough in the ocean floor

04:20.360 --> 04:24.600
had accumulated sediment over millions of years and then been violently

04:24.600 --> 04:25.400
uplifted

04:25.400 --> 04:29.280
they called this trough a geosyncline and they soon found

04:29.280 --> 04:32.800
other mountain ranges in the world that had been formed in the same way

04:32.800 --> 04:36.000
but they still had no clue as to what caused them

04:36.400 --> 04:40.880
then in the 1960s researchers made a discovery that transformed our

04:40.880 --> 04:42.280
understanding of the earth

04:42.280 --> 04:47.720
and its geological history the theory of plate tectonics concludes that we live

04:47.720 --> 04:49.000
on pieces of crust

04:49.000 --> 04:53.080
floating on partially melted rock as they drift around the earth's surface

04:53.080 --> 04:57.100
it's likely these crustal plates are driven by convection currents in the

04:57.100 --> 04:58.280
earth's upper mantle

04:58.280 --> 05:01.480
thicker crustal plates made mostly of granite

05:01.480 --> 05:05.960
make up our continents the oceans mostly fill the lower and thinner crustal

05:06.000 --> 05:07.440
plates made of basalt

05:07.440 --> 05:10.520
in some places these plates are moving apart

05:10.520 --> 05:13.800
and new rocks well up from the earth's mantle to fill the gap

05:13.800 --> 05:16.960
in other places they slide alongside each other

05:16.960 --> 05:21.720
and elsewhere they collide buckling at the crash site and throwing up huge

05:21.720 --> 05:22.800
mountain chains

05:22.800 --> 05:27.880
now the uplift could be explained and it fitted exactly with the geosyncline

05:27.880 --> 05:28.440
model

05:28.440 --> 05:31.520
the deep troughs were in fact the boundaries between

05:31.520 --> 05:36.400
oceanic and continental crustal plates accumulating sediment over millions of

05:36.400 --> 05:37.040
years

05:37.040 --> 05:41.480
as the ocean closed it brought two continents into collision

05:41.480 --> 05:46.480
thanks to precise GPS measurements geologists can now see the process

05:46.480 --> 05:47.160
happening

05:47.160 --> 05:51.880
the continents are indeed moving at about the speed your fingernails grow

05:51.880 --> 05:56.640
as Africa and Europe collide the Alps rise about one millimeter a year

05:56.640 --> 06:01.480
and as India and Asia collide they force up the Himalayas five times faster

06:01.520 --> 06:04.840
plate tectonics also showed that earthquakes

06:04.840 --> 06:08.760
aren't the action of a vengeful God they're the buckling and jarring along

06:08.760 --> 06:10.600
the edges of the crustal plates

06:10.600 --> 06:15.280
so if we look at the earth today we see processes that fit perfectly with the

06:15.280 --> 06:17.160
rocks we find from the past

06:17.160 --> 06:21.440
we can see and measure uplift identical to the uplift of the past

06:21.440 --> 06:24.960
we can see how material is slowly eroded and deposited

06:24.960 --> 06:28.000
and it matches exactly the deposits of the past

06:28.160 --> 06:31.880
we can even see the same patterns and layering of the rocks today

06:31.880 --> 06:36.640
as in rocks millions of years old sometimes the sedimentary patterns are

06:36.640 --> 06:37.400
repetitive

06:37.400 --> 06:40.920
if for example deposits are laid down in a seasonal cycle

06:40.920 --> 06:45.480
sometimes currents are gentle and the sediments show distinct rippling

06:45.480 --> 06:49.000
shifting ripples in stream deposits and sand dunes

06:49.000 --> 06:53.840
lead to a structure called cross bedding and we can see the result of floods

06:53.840 --> 06:57.280
annual floods catastrophic floods local floods

06:57.440 --> 07:02.080
each type of flood leaves its mark and leaves clues as to how strong it was

07:02.080 --> 07:05.640
how long it lasted and what sort of material it carried

07:05.640 --> 07:09.640
we can see a number of different floods at different times in the past

07:09.640 --> 07:14.760
going back hundreds of millions of years if a global flood really had happened

07:14.760 --> 07:16.320
just four thousand years ago

07:16.320 --> 07:21.040
it would not go unnoticed and finally take a look at this place

07:21.040 --> 07:25.640
the Peak District of Derbyshire in Britain several meters down this coal

07:25.720 --> 07:28.760
which is the compressed remnants of a hot swampy forest

07:28.760 --> 07:31.880
go further down past a layer of hard grit

07:31.880 --> 07:36.160
and we find a coral reef which means that further back in time this cold

07:36.160 --> 07:36.760
moorland

07:36.760 --> 07:41.000
was once a warm tropical sea the reason is simple

07:41.000 --> 07:44.920
the evidence shows that around 350 million years ago

07:44.920 --> 07:48.000
the European crustal plate was much further south

07:48.000 --> 07:51.600
and low-lying areas were covered by a warm coral sea

07:51.600 --> 07:55.560
then sea levels fell the area became a river delta

07:55.840 --> 08:00.320
and the coral was buried under sand and gravel millions of years later sea

08:00.320 --> 08:01.600
levels dropped further

08:01.600 --> 08:04.600
and the Delta turned into a swampy tropical forest

08:04.600 --> 08:08.600
over the next hundred million years the European crustal plate

08:08.600 --> 08:13.160
moved slowly northwards to its current position so to geologists there's no

08:13.160 --> 08:17.520
puzzle as to why we find the remnants of three completely different environments

08:17.520 --> 08:22.080
in the same location it fits perfectly with what we know about crustal plate

08:22.080 --> 08:22.720
movements

08:22.720 --> 08:27.680
erosion and sedimentation faced with two hundred years of solid and well

08:27.680 --> 08:28.800
researched evidence

08:28.800 --> 08:32.360
creationists have come up with a few theories of their own to counter it

08:32.360 --> 08:36.280
I wanted to do more on the wild theories of these Noah's arkists

08:36.280 --> 08:39.560
but was so staggered at the outlandishness of their claims

08:39.560 --> 08:43.080
that I decided I couldn't give it adequate treatment in the time I got for

08:43.080 --> 08:43.840
this video

08:43.840 --> 08:47.040
so I'm going to make another video especially for them

08:47.040 --> 08:51.080
now let's go back to the quiz at the beginning

08:51.400 --> 08:55.160
unless you recognize these pictures I can assume you weren't there when these

08:55.160 --> 08:56.360
disasters happened

08:56.360 --> 09:01.240
and neither you nor I witnessed them but just like the geology all around us

09:01.240 --> 09:05.880
each of these photos has clues and by using our frontal lobes

09:05.880 --> 09:10.440
the reasoning parts of our brain we can indeed work out what happened in the

09:10.440 --> 09:10.880
past

09:21.080 --> 09:23.160
you
