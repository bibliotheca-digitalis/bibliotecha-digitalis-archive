00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,440
Let's try a quick quiz. These pictures show the aftermath of four different disasters

2
00:00:05,440 --> 00:00:08,760
a tornado, an earthquake, a hurricane and a flood

3
00:00:08,760 --> 00:00:13,840
question is which is which? Just pause the video for a second to figure it out

4
00:00:13,840 --> 00:00:18,640
okay not too hard was it? answers will be at the end

5
00:00:18,640 --> 00:00:23,360
what this quiz tells us is something that Bible preacher Kent Hovind

6
00:00:23,360 --> 00:00:25,800
has yet to figure out about the history of the earth

7
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,760
you're right Kent

8
00:00:33,760 --> 00:00:37,960
I wasn't there. The problem is you weren't there either

9
00:00:37,960 --> 00:00:42,640
none of us was there so how can we best work out the earth's history

10
00:00:42,640 --> 00:00:45,880
follow Bronze Age beliefs, follow our hearts

11
00:00:45,880 --> 00:00:49,280
make it up or do what you did with the photos

12
00:00:49,280 --> 00:00:53,480
and look at the clues that these events leave behind. After all

13
00:00:53,480 --> 00:00:57,400
deducing what happened in the past is a process we go through every day

14
00:00:57,760 --> 00:01:01,960
if we weren't there we have to work it out by observation and deduction

15
00:01:01,960 --> 00:01:04,960
each sedimentary rock on earth for example

16
00:01:04,960 --> 00:01:08,800
tells the story of how it was formed and under what conditions

17
00:01:08,800 --> 00:01:12,560
geologists can identify ancient earthquakes and floods

18
00:01:12,560 --> 00:01:17,840
just as you can identify recent ones but this knowledge wasn't gained overnight

19
00:01:17,840 --> 00:01:22,000
for centuries people didn't question the biblical version of creation

20
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:25,400
but in the 18th century the Age of Enlightenment

21
00:01:25,600 --> 00:01:30,520
curiosity led some leading thinkers to take a closer look at the rocks that God had made

22
00:01:30,520 --> 00:01:34,120
and the more they looked the more things didn't add up

23
00:01:34,120 --> 00:01:38,520
many of the rocks they saw were in layers and made of the sort of material

24
00:01:38,520 --> 00:01:40,240
you'd find at the bottom of the sea

25
00:01:40,240 --> 00:01:43,960
okay but why was some of these sedimentary layers

26
00:01:43,960 --> 00:01:47,840
at odd angles or on mountain tops or bent out of shape

27
00:01:47,840 --> 00:01:50,880
why were the layers made of different materials

28
00:01:51,880 --> 00:01:55,920
underneath the top sedimentary layers the picture got even more complicated

29
00:01:55,920 --> 00:01:59,840
in 1788 the man called the father of geology

30
00:01:59,840 --> 00:02:03,720
James Hutton saw a geological formation that seemed impossible

31
00:02:03,720 --> 00:02:09,200
at Siccar Point in Scotland he found this set of almost horizontal sedimentary beds

32
00:02:09,200 --> 00:02:12,320
sitting directly on top of an almost vertical set

33
00:02:12,320 --> 00:02:15,680
and this formation wasn't unique it's called

34
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:20,280
an angular unconformity and geologists soon found angular unconformities all

35
00:02:20,280 --> 00:02:21,200
over the place

36
00:02:21,200 --> 00:02:25,440
by the mid 19th century two principles had been established

37
00:02:25,440 --> 00:02:29,720
it was clear that sedimentary beds that were once at the bottom of the sea

38
00:02:29,720 --> 00:02:33,760
must have been uplifted of course the effect of these uplifts

39
00:02:33,760 --> 00:02:38,480
and their opposite number subsidence's are enhanced by the rise and fall of sea

40
00:02:38,480 --> 00:02:39,080
levels

41
00:02:39,080 --> 00:02:44,360
as polar ice caps grow and melt but a rise in sea level alone doesn't explain

42
00:02:44,360 --> 00:02:46,720
how sedimentary rocks can be folded

43
00:02:46,880 --> 00:02:51,400
and lifted several miles high some unseen force was acting on them

44
00:02:51,400 --> 00:02:56,440
once uplifted the rocks are subjected to erosion by wind and water

45
00:02:56,440 --> 00:03:00,280
silt sand and mud are washed into the rivers and out to sea

46
00:03:00,280 --> 00:03:04,720
where they're deposited slowly building up the sedimentary beds that will become the

47
00:03:04,720 --> 00:03:05,880
rocks of the future

48
00:03:05,880 --> 00:03:10,040
so angular unconformities weren't that weird after all

49
00:03:10,040 --> 00:03:14,480
the lower beds were laid down under the sea with material eroded from the land

50
00:03:14,920 --> 00:03:18,840
over time and under pressure water percolated through the deposits

51
00:03:18,840 --> 00:03:21,880
precipitating minerals that cemented the grains together

52
00:03:21,880 --> 00:03:25,200
then the solid beds were lifted up and deformed

53
00:03:25,200 --> 00:03:29,160
now above sea level wind and rain eroded the rocks

54
00:03:29,160 --> 00:03:33,960
forming a soil at the surface after a period of time sea levels rose

55
00:03:33,960 --> 00:03:38,120
and covered the beds once again more sediment was laid on top

56
00:03:38,120 --> 00:03:41,480
and the sea levels fell and the beds were exposed

57
00:03:42,360 --> 00:03:46,120
nearly every feature they'd seen in the rocks of the past can be seen in the

58
00:03:46,120 --> 00:03:48,240
deposits that are being laid down today

59
00:03:48,240 --> 00:03:51,480
showing that this was a long and continual process

60
00:03:51,480 --> 00:03:56,640
that took millions of years so early 19th century geologists had to forget

61
00:03:56,640 --> 00:04:01,120
their preconceived ideas of a 6,500 year old world

62
00:04:01,120 --> 00:04:04,400
and a 4,000 year old flood instead

63
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:09,800
they followed the evidence but although they understood erosion and sedimentation

64
00:04:09,880 --> 00:04:14,360
the frequent uplifts were a puzzle by observing and analyzing the rocks of the

65
00:04:14,360 --> 00:04:16,360
Appalachians in the 1850s

66
00:04:16,360 --> 00:04:20,360
American geologists deduced that a deep trough in the ocean floor

67
00:04:20,360 --> 00:04:24,600
had accumulated sediment over millions of years and then been violently

68
00:04:24,600 --> 00:04:25,400
uplifted

69
00:04:25,400 --> 00:04:29,280
they called this trough a geosyncline and they soon found

70
00:04:29,280 --> 00:04:32,800
other mountain ranges in the world that had been formed in the same way

71
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:36,000
but they still had no clue as to what caused them

72
00:04:36,400 --> 00:04:40,880
then in the 1960s researchers made a discovery that transformed our

73
00:04:40,880 --> 00:04:42,280
understanding of the earth

74
00:04:42,280 --> 00:04:47,720
and its geological history the theory of plate tectonics concludes that we live

75
00:04:47,720 --> 00:04:49,000
on pieces of crust

76
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:53,080
floating on partially melted rock as they drift around the earth's surface

77
00:04:53,080 --> 00:04:57,100
it's likely these crustal plates are driven by convection currents in the

78
00:04:57,100 --> 00:04:58,280
earth's upper mantle

79
00:04:58,280 --> 00:05:01,480
thicker crustal plates made mostly of granite

80
00:05:01,480 --> 00:05:05,960
make up our continents the oceans mostly fill the lower and thinner crustal

81
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:07,440
plates made of basalt

82
00:05:07,440 --> 00:05:10,520
in some places these plates are moving apart

83
00:05:10,520 --> 00:05:13,800
and new rocks well up from the earth's mantle to fill the gap

84
00:05:13,800 --> 00:05:16,960
in other places they slide alongside each other

85
00:05:16,960 --> 00:05:21,720
and elsewhere they collide buckling at the crash site and throwing up huge

86
00:05:21,720 --> 00:05:22,800
mountain chains

87
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:27,880
now the uplift could be explained and it fitted exactly with the geosyncline

88
00:05:27,880 --> 00:05:28,440
model

89
00:05:28,440 --> 00:05:31,520
the deep troughs were in fact the boundaries between

90
00:05:31,520 --> 00:05:36,400
oceanic and continental crustal plates accumulating sediment over millions of

91
00:05:36,400 --> 00:05:37,040
years

92
00:05:37,040 --> 00:05:41,480
as the ocean closed it brought two continents into collision

93
00:05:41,480 --> 00:05:46,480
thanks to precise GPS measurements geologists can now see the process

94
00:05:46,480 --> 00:05:47,160
happening

95
00:05:47,160 --> 00:05:51,880
the continents are indeed moving at about the speed your fingernails grow

96
00:05:51,880 --> 00:05:56,640
as Africa and Europe collide the Alps rise about one millimeter a year

97
00:05:56,640 --> 00:06:01,480
and as India and Asia collide they force up the Himalayas five times faster

98
00:06:01,520 --> 00:06:04,840
plate tectonics also showed that earthquakes

99
00:06:04,840 --> 00:06:08,760
aren't the action of a vengeful God they're the buckling and jarring along

100
00:06:08,760 --> 00:06:10,600
the edges of the crustal plates

101
00:06:10,600 --> 00:06:15,280
so if we look at the earth today we see processes that fit perfectly with the

102
00:06:15,280 --> 00:06:17,160
rocks we find from the past

103
00:06:17,160 --> 00:06:21,440
we can see and measure uplift identical to the uplift of the past

104
00:06:21,440 --> 00:06:24,960
we can see how material is slowly eroded and deposited

105
00:06:24,960 --> 00:06:28,000
and it matches exactly the deposits of the past

106
00:06:28,160 --> 00:06:31,880
we can even see the same patterns and layering of the rocks today

107
00:06:31,880 --> 00:06:36,640
as in rocks millions of years old sometimes the sedimentary patterns are

108
00:06:36,640 --> 00:06:37,400
repetitive

109
00:06:37,400 --> 00:06:40,920
if for example deposits are laid down in a seasonal cycle

110
00:06:40,920 --> 00:06:45,480
sometimes currents are gentle and the sediments show distinct rippling

111
00:06:45,480 --> 00:06:49,000
shifting ripples in stream deposits and sand dunes

112
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:53,840
lead to a structure called cross bedding and we can see the result of floods

113
00:06:53,840 --> 00:06:57,280
annual floods catastrophic floods local floods

114
00:06:57,440 --> 00:07:02,080
each type of flood leaves its mark and leaves clues as to how strong it was

115
00:07:02,080 --> 00:07:05,640
how long it lasted and what sort of material it carried

116
00:07:05,640 --> 00:07:09,640
we can see a number of different floods at different times in the past

117
00:07:09,640 --> 00:07:14,760
going back hundreds of millions of years if a global flood really had happened

118
00:07:14,760 --> 00:07:16,320
just four thousand years ago

119
00:07:16,320 --> 00:07:21,040
it would not go unnoticed and finally take a look at this place

120
00:07:21,040 --> 00:07:25,640
the Peak District of Derbyshire in Britain several meters down this coal

121
00:07:25,720 --> 00:07:28,760
which is the compressed remnants of a hot swampy forest

122
00:07:28,760 --> 00:07:31,880
go further down past a layer of hard grit

123
00:07:31,880 --> 00:07:36,160
and we find a coral reef which means that further back in time this cold

124
00:07:36,160 --> 00:07:36,760
moorland

125
00:07:36,760 --> 00:07:41,000
was once a warm tropical sea the reason is simple

126
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:44,920
the evidence shows that around 350 million years ago

127
00:07:44,920 --> 00:07:48,000
the European crustal plate was much further south

128
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:51,600
and low-lying areas were covered by a warm coral sea

129
00:07:51,600 --> 00:07:55,560
then sea levels fell the area became a river delta

130
00:07:55,840 --> 00:08:00,320
and the coral was buried under sand and gravel millions of years later sea

131
00:08:00,320 --> 00:08:01,600
levels dropped further

132
00:08:01,600 --> 00:08:04,600
and the Delta turned into a swampy tropical forest

133
00:08:04,600 --> 00:08:08,600
over the next hundred million years the European crustal plate

134
00:08:08,600 --> 00:08:13,160
moved slowly northwards to its current position so to geologists there's no

135
00:08:13,160 --> 00:08:17,520
puzzle as to why we find the remnants of three completely different environments

136
00:08:17,520 --> 00:08:22,080
in the same location it fits perfectly with what we know about crustal plate

137
00:08:22,080 --> 00:08:22,720
movements

138
00:08:22,720 --> 00:08:27,680
erosion and sedimentation faced with two hundred years of solid and well

139
00:08:27,680 --> 00:08:28,800
researched evidence

140
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:32,360
creationists have come up with a few theories of their own to counter it

141
00:08:32,360 --> 00:08:36,280
I wanted to do more on the wild theories of these Noah's arkists

142
00:08:36,280 --> 00:08:39,560
but was so staggered at the outlandishness of their claims

143
00:08:39,560 --> 00:08:43,080
that I decided I couldn't give it adequate treatment in the time I got for

144
00:08:43,080 --> 00:08:43,840
this video

145
00:08:43,840 --> 00:08:47,040
so I'm going to make another video especially for them

146
00:08:47,040 --> 00:08:51,080
now let's go back to the quiz at the beginning

147
00:08:51,400 --> 00:08:55,160
unless you recognize these pictures I can assume you weren't there when these

148
00:08:55,160 --> 00:08:56,360
disasters happened

149
00:08:56,360 --> 00:09:01,240
and neither you nor I witnessed them but just like the geology all around us

150
00:09:01,240 --> 00:09:05,880
each of these photos has clues and by using our frontal lobes

151
00:09:05,880 --> 00:09:10,440
the reasoning parts of our brain we can indeed work out what happened in the

152
00:09:10,440 --> 00:09:10,880
past

153
00:09:21,080 --> 00:09:23,160
you
