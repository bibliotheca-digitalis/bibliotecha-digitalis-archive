0	5440	Let's try a quick quiz. These pictures show the aftermath of four different disasters
5440	8760	a tornado, an earthquake, a hurricane and a flood
8760	13840	question is which is which? Just pause the video for a second to figure it out
13840	18640	okay not too hard was it? answers will be at the end
18640	23360	what this quiz tells us is something that Bible preacher Kent Hovind
23360	25800	has yet to figure out about the history of the earth
30000	33760	you're right Kent
33760	37960	I wasn't there. The problem is you weren't there either
37960	42640	none of us was there so how can we best work out the earth's history
42640	45880	follow Bronze Age beliefs, follow our hearts
45880	49280	make it up or do what you did with the photos
49280	53480	and look at the clues that these events leave behind. After all
53480	57400	deducing what happened in the past is a process we go through every day
57760	61960	if we weren't there we have to work it out by observation and deduction
61960	64960	each sedimentary rock on earth for example
64960	68800	tells the story of how it was formed and under what conditions
68800	72560	geologists can identify ancient earthquakes and floods
72560	77840	just as you can identify recent ones but this knowledge wasn't gained overnight
77840	82000	for centuries people didn't question the biblical version of creation
82000	85400	but in the 18th century the Age of Enlightenment
85600	90520	curiosity led some leading thinkers to take a closer look at the rocks that God had made
90520	94120	and the more they looked the more things didn't add up
94120	98520	many of the rocks they saw were in layers and made of the sort of material
98520	100240	you'd find at the bottom of the sea
100240	103960	okay but why was some of these sedimentary layers
103960	107840	at odd angles or on mountain tops or bent out of shape
107840	110880	why were the layers made of different materials
111880	115920	underneath the top sedimentary layers the picture got even more complicated
115920	119840	in 1788 the man called the father of geology
119840	123720	James Hutton saw a geological formation that seemed impossible
123720	129200	at Siccar Point in Scotland he found this set of almost horizontal sedimentary beds
129200	132320	sitting directly on top of an almost vertical set
132320	135680	and this formation wasn't unique it's called
135680	140280	an angular unconformity and geologists soon found angular unconformities all
140280	141200	over the place
141200	145440	by the mid 19th century two principles had been established
145440	149720	it was clear that sedimentary beds that were once at the bottom of the sea
149720	153760	must have been uplifted of course the effect of these uplifts
153760	158480	and their opposite number subsidence's are enhanced by the rise and fall of sea
158480	159080	levels
159080	164360	as polar ice caps grow and melt but a rise in sea level alone doesn't explain
164360	166720	how sedimentary rocks can be folded
166880	171400	and lifted several miles high some unseen force was acting on them
171400	176440	once uplifted the rocks are subjected to erosion by wind and water
176440	180280	silt sand and mud are washed into the rivers and out to sea
180280	184720	where they're deposited slowly building up the sedimentary beds that will become the
184720	185880	rocks of the future
185880	190040	so angular unconformities weren't that weird after all
190040	194480	the lower beds were laid down under the sea with material eroded from the land
194920	198840	over time and under pressure water percolated through the deposits
198840	201880	precipitating minerals that cemented the grains together
201880	205200	then the solid beds were lifted up and deformed
205200	209160	now above sea level wind and rain eroded the rocks
209160	213960	forming a soil at the surface after a period of time sea levels rose
213960	218120	and covered the beds once again more sediment was laid on top
218120	221480	and the sea levels fell and the beds were exposed
222360	226120	nearly every feature they'd seen in the rocks of the past can be seen in the
226120	228240	deposits that are being laid down today
228240	231480	showing that this was a long and continual process
231480	236640	that took millions of years so early 19th century geologists had to forget
236640	241120	their preconceived ideas of a 6,500 year old world
241120	244400	and a 4,000 year old flood instead
244400	249800	they followed the evidence but although they understood erosion and sedimentation
249880	254360	the frequent uplifts were a puzzle by observing and analyzing the rocks of the
254360	256360	Appalachians in the 1850s
256360	260360	American geologists deduced that a deep trough in the ocean floor
260360	264600	had accumulated sediment over millions of years and then been violently
264600	265400	uplifted
265400	269280	they called this trough a geosyncline and they soon found
269280	272800	other mountain ranges in the world that had been formed in the same way
272800	276000	but they still had no clue as to what caused them
276400	280880	then in the 1960s researchers made a discovery that transformed our
280880	282280	understanding of the earth
282280	287720	and its geological history the theory of plate tectonics concludes that we live
287720	289000	on pieces of crust
289000	293080	floating on partially melted rock as they drift around the earth's surface
293080	297100	it's likely these crustal plates are driven by convection currents in the
297100	298280	earth's upper mantle
298280	301480	thicker crustal plates made mostly of granite
301480	305960	make up our continents the oceans mostly fill the lower and thinner crustal
306000	307440	plates made of basalt
307440	310520	in some places these plates are moving apart
310520	313800	and new rocks well up from the earth's mantle to fill the gap
313800	316960	in other places they slide alongside each other
316960	321720	and elsewhere they collide buckling at the crash site and throwing up huge
321720	322800	mountain chains
322800	327880	now the uplift could be explained and it fitted exactly with the geosyncline
327880	328440	model
328440	331520	the deep troughs were in fact the boundaries between
331520	336400	oceanic and continental crustal plates accumulating sediment over millions of
336400	337040	years
337040	341480	as the ocean closed it brought two continents into collision
341480	346480	thanks to precise GPS measurements geologists can now see the process
346480	347160	happening
347160	351880	the continents are indeed moving at about the speed your fingernails grow
351880	356640	as Africa and Europe collide the Alps rise about one millimeter a year
356640	361480	and as India and Asia collide they force up the Himalayas five times faster
361520	364840	plate tectonics also showed that earthquakes
364840	368760	aren't the action of a vengeful God they're the buckling and jarring along
368760	370600	the edges of the crustal plates
370600	375280	so if we look at the earth today we see processes that fit perfectly with the
375280	377160	rocks we find from the past
377160	381440	we can see and measure uplift identical to the uplift of the past
381440	384960	we can see how material is slowly eroded and deposited
384960	388000	and it matches exactly the deposits of the past
388160	391880	we can even see the same patterns and layering of the rocks today
391880	396640	as in rocks millions of years old sometimes the sedimentary patterns are
396640	397400	repetitive
397400	400920	if for example deposits are laid down in a seasonal cycle
400920	405480	sometimes currents are gentle and the sediments show distinct rippling
405480	409000	shifting ripples in stream deposits and sand dunes
409000	413840	lead to a structure called cross bedding and we can see the result of floods
413840	417280	annual floods catastrophic floods local floods
417440	422080	each type of flood leaves its mark and leaves clues as to how strong it was
422080	425640	how long it lasted and what sort of material it carried
425640	429640	we can see a number of different floods at different times in the past
429640	434760	going back hundreds of millions of years if a global flood really had happened
434760	436320	just four thousand years ago
436320	441040	it would not go unnoticed and finally take a look at this place
441040	445640	the Peak District of Derbyshire in Britain several meters down this coal
445720	448760	which is the compressed remnants of a hot swampy forest
448760	451880	go further down past a layer of hard grit
451880	456160	and we find a coral reef which means that further back in time this cold
456160	456760	moorland
456760	461000	was once a warm tropical sea the reason is simple
461000	464920	the evidence shows that around 350 million years ago
464920	468000	the European crustal plate was much further south
468000	471600	and low-lying areas were covered by a warm coral sea
471600	475560	then sea levels fell the area became a river delta
475840	480320	and the coral was buried under sand and gravel millions of years later sea
480320	481600	levels dropped further
481600	484600	and the Delta turned into a swampy tropical forest
484600	488600	over the next hundred million years the European crustal plate
488600	493160	moved slowly northwards to its current position so to geologists there's no
493160	497520	puzzle as to why we find the remnants of three completely different environments
497520	502080	in the same location it fits perfectly with what we know about crustal plate
502080	502720	movements
502720	507680	erosion and sedimentation faced with two hundred years of solid and well
507680	508800	researched evidence
508800	512360	creationists have come up with a few theories of their own to counter it
512360	516280	I wanted to do more on the wild theories of these Noah's arkists
516280	519560	but was so staggered at the outlandishness of their claims
519560	523080	that I decided I couldn't give it adequate treatment in the time I got for
523080	523840	this video
523840	527040	so I'm going to make another video especially for them
527040	531080	now let's go back to the quiz at the beginning
531400	535160	unless you recognize these pictures I can assume you weren't there when these
535160	536360	disasters happened
536360	541240	and neither you nor I witnessed them but just like the geology all around us
541240	545880	each of these photos has clues and by using our frontal lobes
545880	550440	the reasoning parts of our brain we can indeed work out what happened in the
550440	550880	past
561080	563160	you
