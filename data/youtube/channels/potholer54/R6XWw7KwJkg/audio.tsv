0	5980	This video is going to be very difficult to make and it's going to be very difficult for you to understand
6840	8840	Because I'm going to be talking about
9180	15740	Mathematical formulas and I'm going to be talking a lot about mathematics. So if you don't understand mathematics
16420	18420	Don't watch this video
19980	23280	Okay next but hey, how about the Earth's magnetic field this is hilarious
23280	27660	There's magnetic field has been measured since 1835 and it's growing weaker, which means it used to be
28380	32580	Stronger you guys are on the ball. Okay. Here's the problem. The evolutionists have though folks if we extrapolate backwards
32580	39380	Just as 20,000 years ago how long 20,000 years ago 20 million not 20 minutes would be billion 20 billion 20,000 years ago
39380	42740	The heat produced by the magnetic field would have liquefied the earth
44420	48680	20,000 years ago and a million years ago folks if this the magnetic field would have been so strong
48680	51360	It would have vaporized our planet vaporize the planet
52580	56360	Now I had to think long and hard about this because even for a creationist theory
56360	60320	This is nuts. How would the Earth's magnetic field melt anything?
60800	65480	The first thing I did was to figure out exactly how much heat it would take to melt the Earth's crust
65920	68760	over 30 trillion trillion kilojoules
69320	74000	I'm sure the heating engineers watching this will tell you my calculation is dodgy and to be honest
74000	78720	I haven't really checked it but still we need a staggering amount of heat to liquefy the earth
79140	82420	Even Crohn's fellow creationists would tell him this sounds nuts
82620	88740	So here's what I think happened Billy was sitting at the breakfast table one morning reading a book by Thomas Barnes a
89020	94800	Creationist who argued that because the Earth's magnetic field is decaying it must have been excessively high in the past
95500	103200	Working his way through a bowl of sugar-frosted sugar loops Crohn thought very high magnetic field Wow like those energy fields in Star Wars and stuff
103200	107300	Maybe it would like heat up the planet or something. Hey wait vaporize the entire planet
108300	113140	But the Earth's magnetic field doesn't even melt ice at the poles where it interacts with the Earth's surface
113340	118120	So it's not going to melt any rocks firstly Barnes made a crucial error
118220	122680	He assumed that the magnetic field was generated by an electrical circuit within the earth
122820	130620	Which is an old idea long discarded as the energy runs down thought Barnes the electrical circuit weakens and the magnetic field dies
131100	137180	So extrapolate back and the magnetic field would have been much stronger in the past now his reasoning would mean
137300	143460	That the electrical current needed to produce such a huge magnetic field would have required a huge amount of energy
144060	147180	Yes enough energy to melt every rock on the planet
147700	150380	Unable to climb down from the chair on which he was dancing
150460	157060	Crohn mistook the high amount of energy required to generate the magnetic field to mean that the magnetic field itself
157500	161220	generated energy since Barnes wrote that book in 1973
162020	169160	Researchers have discovered that it's not free electrons that generate the magnetic field but the movement of molten rock that acts as a kind of dynamo
170060	174620	thermodynamic currents are caused by heating and cooling just as happens in the world's oceans and
174780	179920	Just as oceans circulate because of the motion of the earth so does molten rock under the surface
180180	185200	The magnetic field strengthens and weakens according to the dynamics of this circulation
185840	191920	Okay, Billy what else now folks here's the problem with the evolutionary time scale runs in the major problems starting with just one couple
191920	197880	Hey people not eight people just one couple just 41,000 years ago. Did you say a million not a million two million?
197880	205000	Not two million just 41,000 years ago taking into wars and all that stuff the population on earth by now folks would be two to
205000	209080	Ten to the 89th power. How great is that number? This number is so great folks
209080	212280	There would not be enough space in the universe to hold that many bodies
215920	217120	I
217120	221380	Can't dissect Billy Crohn's calculations because he doesn't give us any calculations
221480	227240	So does anyone have a mathematical analysis of this population thing, but if you're good at mathematics
227240	229240	You're probably gonna understand what I'm trying to say
229640	234280	Well, I wanted to avoid some difficult math, but I guess there's no way around it
235060	241980	Human population history has been calculated by geneticists and anthropologists, but as you can see the math is not easy
242260	244380	This is just one part of one paper
244900	249300	Analyzing the manifestation of inbreeding in genes and its effect on population
249380	253540	So, let's see what creationist mathematicians have come up with to debunk it
254300	261260	And if you want to watch this video and you're not very good at maths then try and understand what I'm saying and try and stay
261260	266860	Along, okay fair enough. I'll listen carefully to your argument and if I manage to spot a flaw at some point
266860	269540	I'll stop the video. We have the original population
270300	272300	Okay, let me stop you there
272780	278000	No part of evolution theory suggests that the original population of humans was two
278540	281420	Humans evolved in groups through the interchange of genes
281640	285740	We can all trace our ancestry back to one man and one woman, of course
285740	291780	But they lived at different times in different places. There was never an original pair of breeding humans
292020	299300	But do go on the population doubles every 150 years. Sorry. I have to stop you again on what basis did the prehistoric population
299900	304080	Double every 150 years. Where does that figure come from? I
304940	308860	Messaged truthful Christian to ask him for his source and he wrote back
308860	314380	I got this number from a friend of mine at the fitness club in my local area
315140	317140	Yes, but it's not
317780	318900	Look
318900	322140	scientists have spent decades researching human population through
322460	327640	Archaeological evidence and the mapping of the human genome and they've written volumes of scientific papers
327880	334700	Calculating past population growth based on this evidence and you're saying that all they really needed to do was ask Richard Simmons
335000	340480	Now I don't want to be too hard on truthful Christian because no one who sincerely wanted to pull the wool over our eyes
340480	346040	Would be so honest as to admit that his scientific information comes from the local gym and truthful
346040	352040	Christian was honest enough under no pressure from me to accept that he may be wrong and his numbers may not be accurate
352600	358440	So clearly this guy isn't out to deliberately deceive and this disqualifies him for a golden crocodile
358680	365520	But let's pursue this local fitness club connection. I think I may have traced it back to this line from answers in Genesis
365840	371000	Let us assume a IG says that the population doubles every 150 years
371840	377540	Why assume such an arbitrary figure? Why not 80 or 200 or 120?
378180	380860	Because answers in Genesis was working backwards
381460	386700	the Bible gave it a starting population of eight people and a IG wanted to show that after
387300	391060	4,500 years that population would expand to 6.5 billion
391740	394100	Knowing the answer made the math very easy
394460	400540	What rate of growth is required to get that answer turns out to be a doubling every 150 years?
401340	406980	So then answers in Genesis turned the calculation around and started at the beginning if the population
407540	413740	4,500 years ago was eight people and assuming a doubling of the population every oh, I don't know. Let's say
414380	417180	150 years what population should we have today?
417660	424300	Why it works out to 6.5 billion and since that's what we've got the Bible must be right
425060	428900	Then using the same arbitrary doubling of population every 150 years
429260	433540	What population would we have today if humans have been around for 40,000 years?
433540	436680	There would not be enough space in the universe to hold that many bodies
436680	441640	But of course a doubling of the population every 150 years never happened for most of human history
442100	447340	Human populations expand according to the resources that are available to fuel that expansion
447700	454140	Hunter-gatherers have very low population growth because the land can't support a large population of hunter-gatherers
454420	461180	When the neolithic farming revolution came along populations grew because the same amount of land could support more people
461180	467780	And when cities grew up in Egypt Mesopotamia India and China they could support larger populations still
468380	475620	So prior to the neolithic human populations didn't grow very fast at all. They were constrained by the resources that fed them
476500	478980	Into this mix you have to add the occasional mass
479400	480260	Extermination
480260	488020	Around 70,000 years ago a volcanic eruption in Sumatra caused global cooling which reduced the human population to as little as
488260	490340	10,000 people in Africa and India
491180	498460	Coming up with ideas about human population at the breakfast table is easy if you apply arbitrary numbers and do a bit of simple math
499220	502580	Conducting careful research over decades doing more sophisticated
502660	509660	Sophisticated mathematical calculations not making arbitrary assumptions and basing every conclusion on the evidence is much harder
509780	511780	But the result stands up to scrutiny
