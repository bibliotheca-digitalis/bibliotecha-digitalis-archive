00:00.000 --> 00:05.980
This video is going to be very difficult to make and it's going to be very difficult for you to understand

00:06.840 --> 00:08.840
Because I'm going to be talking about

00:09.180 --> 00:15.740
Mathematical formulas and I'm going to be talking a lot about mathematics. So if you don't understand mathematics

00:16.420 --> 00:18.420
Don't watch this video

00:19.980 --> 00:23.280
Okay next but hey, how about the Earth's magnetic field this is hilarious

00:23.280 --> 00:27.660
There's magnetic field has been measured since 1835 and it's growing weaker, which means it used to be

00:28.380 --> 00:32.580
Stronger you guys are on the ball. Okay. Here's the problem. The evolutionists have though folks if we extrapolate backwards

00:32.580 --> 00:39.380
Just as 20,000 years ago how long 20,000 years ago 20 million not 20 minutes would be billion 20 billion 20,000 years ago

00:39.380 --> 00:42.740
The heat produced by the magnetic field would have liquefied the earth

00:44.420 --> 00:48.680
20,000 years ago and a million years ago folks if this the magnetic field would have been so strong

00:48.680 --> 00:51.360
It would have vaporized our planet vaporize the planet

00:52.580 --> 00:56.360
Now I had to think long and hard about this because even for a creationist theory

00:56.360 --> 01:00.320
This is nuts. How would the Earth's magnetic field melt anything?

01:00.800 --> 01:05.480
The first thing I did was to figure out exactly how much heat it would take to melt the Earth's crust

01:05.920 --> 01:08.760
over 30 trillion trillion kilojoules

01:09.320 --> 01:14.000
I'm sure the heating engineers watching this will tell you my calculation is dodgy and to be honest

01:14.000 --> 01:18.720
I haven't really checked it but still we need a staggering amount of heat to liquefy the earth

01:19.140 --> 01:22.420
Even Crohn's fellow creationists would tell him this sounds nuts

01:22.620 --> 01:28.740
So here's what I think happened Billy was sitting at the breakfast table one morning reading a book by Thomas Barnes a

01:29.020 --> 01:34.800
Creationist who argued that because the Earth's magnetic field is decaying it must have been excessively high in the past

01:35.500 --> 01:43.200
Working his way through a bowl of sugar-frosted sugar loops Crohn thought very high magnetic field Wow like those energy fields in Star Wars and stuff

01:43.200 --> 01:47.300
Maybe it would like heat up the planet or something. Hey wait vaporize the entire planet

01:48.300 --> 01:53.140
But the Earth's magnetic field doesn't even melt ice at the poles where it interacts with the Earth's surface

01:53.340 --> 01:58.120
So it's not going to melt any rocks firstly Barnes made a crucial error

01:58.220 --> 02:02.680
He assumed that the magnetic field was generated by an electrical circuit within the earth

02:02.820 --> 02:10.620
Which is an old idea long discarded as the energy runs down thought Barnes the electrical circuit weakens and the magnetic field dies

02:11.100 --> 02:17.180
So extrapolate back and the magnetic field would have been much stronger in the past now his reasoning would mean

02:17.300 --> 02:23.460
That the electrical current needed to produce such a huge magnetic field would have required a huge amount of energy

02:24.060 --> 02:27.180
Yes enough energy to melt every rock on the planet

02:27.700 --> 02:30.380
Unable to climb down from the chair on which he was dancing

02:30.460 --> 02:37.060
Crohn mistook the high amount of energy required to generate the magnetic field to mean that the magnetic field itself

02:37.500 --> 02:41.220
generated energy since Barnes wrote that book in 1973

02:42.020 --> 02:49.160
Researchers have discovered that it's not free electrons that generate the magnetic field but the movement of molten rock that acts as a kind of dynamo

02:50.060 --> 02:54.620
thermodynamic currents are caused by heating and cooling just as happens in the world's oceans and

02:54.780 --> 02:59.920
Just as oceans circulate because of the motion of the earth so does molten rock under the surface

03:00.180 --> 03:05.200
The magnetic field strengthens and weakens according to the dynamics of this circulation

03:05.840 --> 03:11.920
Okay, Billy what else now folks here's the problem with the evolutionary time scale runs in the major problems starting with just one couple

03:11.920 --> 03:17.880
Hey people not eight people just one couple just 41,000 years ago. Did you say a million not a million two million?

03:17.880 --> 03:25.000
Not two million just 41,000 years ago taking into wars and all that stuff the population on earth by now folks would be two to

03:25.000 --> 03:29.080
Ten to the 89th power. How great is that number? This number is so great folks

03:29.080 --> 03:32.280
There would not be enough space in the universe to hold that many bodies

03:35.920 --> 03:37.120
I

03:37.120 --> 03:41.380
Can't dissect Billy Crohn's calculations because he doesn't give us any calculations

03:41.480 --> 03:47.240
So does anyone have a mathematical analysis of this population thing, but if you're good at mathematics

03:47.240 --> 03:49.240
You're probably gonna understand what I'm trying to say

03:49.640 --> 03:54.280
Well, I wanted to avoid some difficult math, but I guess there's no way around it

03:55.060 --> 04:01.980
Human population history has been calculated by geneticists and anthropologists, but as you can see the math is not easy

04:02.260 --> 04:04.380
This is just one part of one paper

04:04.900 --> 04:09.300
Analyzing the manifestation of inbreeding in genes and its effect on population

04:09.380 --> 04:13.540
So, let's see what creationist mathematicians have come up with to debunk it

04:14.300 --> 04:21.260
And if you want to watch this video and you're not very good at maths then try and understand what I'm saying and try and stay

04:21.260 --> 04:26.860
Along, okay fair enough. I'll listen carefully to your argument and if I manage to spot a flaw at some point

04:26.860 --> 04:29.540
I'll stop the video. We have the original population

04:30.300 --> 04:32.300
Okay, let me stop you there

04:32.780 --> 04:38.000
No part of evolution theory suggests that the original population of humans was two

04:38.540 --> 04:41.420
Humans evolved in groups through the interchange of genes

04:41.640 --> 04:45.740
We can all trace our ancestry back to one man and one woman, of course

04:45.740 --> 04:51.780
But they lived at different times in different places. There was never an original pair of breeding humans

04:52.020 --> 04:59.300
But do go on the population doubles every 150 years. Sorry. I have to stop you again on what basis did the prehistoric population

04:59.900 --> 05:04.080
Double every 150 years. Where does that figure come from? I

05:04.940 --> 05:08.860
Messaged truthful Christian to ask him for his source and he wrote back

05:08.860 --> 05:14.380
I got this number from a friend of mine at the fitness club in my local area

05:15.140 --> 05:17.140
Yes, but it's not

05:17.780 --> 05:18.900
Look

05:18.900 --> 05:22.140
scientists have spent decades researching human population through

05:22.460 --> 05:27.640
Archaeological evidence and the mapping of the human genome and they've written volumes of scientific papers

05:27.880 --> 05:34.700
Calculating past population growth based on this evidence and you're saying that all they really needed to do was ask Richard Simmons

05:35.000 --> 05:40.480
Now I don't want to be too hard on truthful Christian because no one who sincerely wanted to pull the wool over our eyes

05:40.480 --> 05:46.040
Would be so honest as to admit that his scientific information comes from the local gym and truthful

05:46.040 --> 05:52.040
Christian was honest enough under no pressure from me to accept that he may be wrong and his numbers may not be accurate

05:52.600 --> 05:58.440
So clearly this guy isn't out to deliberately deceive and this disqualifies him for a golden crocodile

05:58.680 --> 06:05.520
But let's pursue this local fitness club connection. I think I may have traced it back to this line from answers in Genesis

06:05.840 --> 06:11.000
Let us assume a IG says that the population doubles every 150 years

06:11.840 --> 06:17.540
Why assume such an arbitrary figure? Why not 80 or 200 or 120?

06:18.180 --> 06:20.860
Because answers in Genesis was working backwards

06:21.460 --> 06:26.700
the Bible gave it a starting population of eight people and a IG wanted to show that after

06:27.300 --> 06:31.060
4,500 years that population would expand to 6.5 billion

06:31.740 --> 06:34.100
Knowing the answer made the math very easy

06:34.460 --> 06:40.540
What rate of growth is required to get that answer turns out to be a doubling every 150 years?

06:41.340 --> 06:46.980
So then answers in Genesis turned the calculation around and started at the beginning if the population

06:47.540 --> 06:53.740
4,500 years ago was eight people and assuming a doubling of the population every oh, I don't know. Let's say

06:54.380 --> 06:57.180
150 years what population should we have today?

06:57.660 --> 07:04.300
Why it works out to 6.5 billion and since that's what we've got the Bible must be right

07:05.060 --> 07:08.900
Then using the same arbitrary doubling of population every 150 years

07:09.260 --> 07:13.540
What population would we have today if humans have been around for 40,000 years?

07:13.540 --> 07:16.680
There would not be enough space in the universe to hold that many bodies

07:16.680 --> 07:21.640
But of course a doubling of the population every 150 years never happened for most of human history

07:22.100 --> 07:27.340
Human populations expand according to the resources that are available to fuel that expansion

07:27.700 --> 07:34.140
Hunter-gatherers have very low population growth because the land can't support a large population of hunter-gatherers

07:34.420 --> 07:41.180
When the neolithic farming revolution came along populations grew because the same amount of land could support more people

07:41.180 --> 07:47.780
And when cities grew up in Egypt Mesopotamia India and China they could support larger populations still

07:48.380 --> 07:55.620
So prior to the neolithic human populations didn't grow very fast at all. They were constrained by the resources that fed them

07:56.500 --> 07:58.980
Into this mix you have to add the occasional mass

07:59.400 --> 08:00.260
Extermination

08:00.260 --> 08:08.020
Around 70,000 years ago a volcanic eruption in Sumatra caused global cooling which reduced the human population to as little as

08:08.260 --> 08:10.340
10,000 people in Africa and India

08:11.180 --> 08:18.460
Coming up with ideas about human population at the breakfast table is easy if you apply arbitrary numbers and do a bit of simple math

08:19.220 --> 08:22.580
Conducting careful research over decades doing more sophisticated

08:22.660 --> 08:29.660
Sophisticated mathematical calculations not making arbitrary assumptions and basing every conclusion on the evidence is much harder

08:29.780 --> 08:31.780
But the result stands up to scrutiny
