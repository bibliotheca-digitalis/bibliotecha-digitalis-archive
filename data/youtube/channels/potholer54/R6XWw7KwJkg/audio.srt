1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,980
This video is going to be very difficult to make and it's going to be very difficult for you to understand

2
00:00:06,840 --> 00:00:08,840
Because I'm going to be talking about

3
00:00:09,180 --> 00:00:15,740
Mathematical formulas and I'm going to be talking a lot about mathematics. So if you don't understand mathematics

4
00:00:16,420 --> 00:00:18,420
Don't watch this video

5
00:00:19,980 --> 00:00:23,280
Okay next but hey, how about the Earth's magnetic field this is hilarious

6
00:00:23,280 --> 00:00:27,660
There's magnetic field has been measured since 1835 and it's growing weaker, which means it used to be

7
00:00:28,380 --> 00:00:32,580
Stronger you guys are on the ball. Okay. Here's the problem. The evolutionists have though folks if we extrapolate backwards

8
00:00:32,580 --> 00:00:39,380
Just as 20,000 years ago how long 20,000 years ago 20 million not 20 minutes would be billion 20 billion 20,000 years ago

9
00:00:39,380 --> 00:00:42,740
The heat produced by the magnetic field would have liquefied the earth

10
00:00:44,420 --> 00:00:48,680
20,000 years ago and a million years ago folks if this the magnetic field would have been so strong

11
00:00:48,680 --> 00:00:51,360
It would have vaporized our planet vaporize the planet

12
00:00:52,580 --> 00:00:56,360
Now I had to think long and hard about this because even for a creationist theory

13
00:00:56,360 --> 00:01:00,320
This is nuts. How would the Earth's magnetic field melt anything?

14
00:01:00,800 --> 00:01:05,480
The first thing I did was to figure out exactly how much heat it would take to melt the Earth's crust

15
00:01:05,920 --> 00:01:08,760
over 30 trillion trillion kilojoules

16
00:01:09,320 --> 00:01:14,000
I'm sure the heating engineers watching this will tell you my calculation is dodgy and to be honest

17
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:18,720
I haven't really checked it but still we need a staggering amount of heat to liquefy the earth

18
00:01:19,140 --> 00:01:22,420
Even Crohn's fellow creationists would tell him this sounds nuts

19
00:01:22,620 --> 00:01:28,740
So here's what I think happened Billy was sitting at the breakfast table one morning reading a book by Thomas Barnes a

20
00:01:29,020 --> 00:01:34,800
Creationist who argued that because the Earth's magnetic field is decaying it must have been excessively high in the past

21
00:01:35,500 --> 00:01:43,200
Working his way through a bowl of sugar-frosted sugar loops Crohn thought very high magnetic field Wow like those energy fields in Star Wars and stuff

22
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:47,300
Maybe it would like heat up the planet or something. Hey wait vaporize the entire planet

23
00:01:48,300 --> 00:01:53,140
But the Earth's magnetic field doesn't even melt ice at the poles where it interacts with the Earth's surface

24
00:01:53,340 --> 00:01:58,120
So it's not going to melt any rocks firstly Barnes made a crucial error

25
00:01:58,220 --> 00:02:02,680
He assumed that the magnetic field was generated by an electrical circuit within the earth

26
00:02:02,820 --> 00:02:10,620
Which is an old idea long discarded as the energy runs down thought Barnes the electrical circuit weakens and the magnetic field dies

27
00:02:11,100 --> 00:02:17,180
So extrapolate back and the magnetic field would have been much stronger in the past now his reasoning would mean

28
00:02:17,300 --> 00:02:23,460
That the electrical current needed to produce such a huge magnetic field would have required a huge amount of energy

29
00:02:24,060 --> 00:02:27,180
Yes enough energy to melt every rock on the planet

30
00:02:27,700 --> 00:02:30,380
Unable to climb down from the chair on which he was dancing

31
00:02:30,460 --> 00:02:37,060
Crohn mistook the high amount of energy required to generate the magnetic field to mean that the magnetic field itself

32
00:02:37,500 --> 00:02:41,220
generated energy since Barnes wrote that book in 1973

33
00:02:42,020 --> 00:02:49,160
Researchers have discovered that it's not free electrons that generate the magnetic field but the movement of molten rock that acts as a kind of dynamo

34
00:02:50,060 --> 00:02:54,620
thermodynamic currents are caused by heating and cooling just as happens in the world's oceans and

35
00:02:54,780 --> 00:02:59,920
Just as oceans circulate because of the motion of the earth so does molten rock under the surface

36
00:03:00,180 --> 00:03:05,200
The magnetic field strengthens and weakens according to the dynamics of this circulation

37
00:03:05,840 --> 00:03:11,920
Okay, Billy what else now folks here's the problem with the evolutionary time scale runs in the major problems starting with just one couple

38
00:03:11,920 --> 00:03:17,880
Hey people not eight people just one couple just 41,000 years ago. Did you say a million not a million two million?

39
00:03:17,880 --> 00:03:25,000
Not two million just 41,000 years ago taking into wars and all that stuff the population on earth by now folks would be two to

40
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:29,080
Ten to the 89th power. How great is that number? This number is so great folks

41
00:03:29,080 --> 00:03:32,280
There would not be enough space in the universe to hold that many bodies

42
00:03:35,920 --> 00:03:37,120
I

43
00:03:37,120 --> 00:03:41,380
Can't dissect Billy Crohn's calculations because he doesn't give us any calculations

44
00:03:41,480 --> 00:03:47,240
So does anyone have a mathematical analysis of this population thing, but if you're good at mathematics

45
00:03:47,240 --> 00:03:49,240
You're probably gonna understand what I'm trying to say

46
00:03:49,640 --> 00:03:54,280
Well, I wanted to avoid some difficult math, but I guess there's no way around it

47
00:03:55,060 --> 00:04:01,980
Human population history has been calculated by geneticists and anthropologists, but as you can see the math is not easy

48
00:04:02,260 --> 00:04:04,380
This is just one part of one paper

49
00:04:04,900 --> 00:04:09,300
Analyzing the manifestation of inbreeding in genes and its effect on population

50
00:04:09,380 --> 00:04:13,540
So, let's see what creationist mathematicians have come up with to debunk it

51
00:04:14,300 --> 00:04:21,260
And if you want to watch this video and you're not very good at maths then try and understand what I'm saying and try and stay

52
00:04:21,260 --> 00:04:26,860
Along, okay fair enough. I'll listen carefully to your argument and if I manage to spot a flaw at some point

53
00:04:26,860 --> 00:04:29,540
I'll stop the video. We have the original population

54
00:04:30,300 --> 00:04:32,300
Okay, let me stop you there

55
00:04:32,780 --> 00:04:38,000
No part of evolution theory suggests that the original population of humans was two

56
00:04:38,540 --> 00:04:41,420
Humans evolved in groups through the interchange of genes

57
00:04:41,640 --> 00:04:45,740
We can all trace our ancestry back to one man and one woman, of course

58
00:04:45,740 --> 00:04:51,780
But they lived at different times in different places. There was never an original pair of breeding humans

59
00:04:52,020 --> 00:04:59,300
But do go on the population doubles every 150 years. Sorry. I have to stop you again on what basis did the prehistoric population

60
00:04:59,900 --> 00:05:04,080
Double every 150 years. Where does that figure come from? I

61
00:05:04,940 --> 00:05:08,860
Messaged truthful Christian to ask him for his source and he wrote back

62
00:05:08,860 --> 00:05:14,380
I got this number from a friend of mine at the fitness club in my local area

63
00:05:15,140 --> 00:05:17,140
Yes, but it's not

64
00:05:17,780 --> 00:05:18,900
Look

65
00:05:18,900 --> 00:05:22,140
scientists have spent decades researching human population through

66
00:05:22,460 --> 00:05:27,640
Archaeological evidence and the mapping of the human genome and they've written volumes of scientific papers

67
00:05:27,880 --> 00:05:34,700
Calculating past population growth based on this evidence and you're saying that all they really needed to do was ask Richard Simmons

68
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:40,480
Now I don't want to be too hard on truthful Christian because no one who sincerely wanted to pull the wool over our eyes

69
00:05:40,480 --> 00:05:46,040
Would be so honest as to admit that his scientific information comes from the local gym and truthful

70
00:05:46,040 --> 00:05:52,040
Christian was honest enough under no pressure from me to accept that he may be wrong and his numbers may not be accurate

71
00:05:52,600 --> 00:05:58,440
So clearly this guy isn't out to deliberately deceive and this disqualifies him for a golden crocodile

72
00:05:58,680 --> 00:06:05,520
But let's pursue this local fitness club connection. I think I may have traced it back to this line from answers in Genesis

73
00:06:05,840 --> 00:06:11,000
Let us assume a IG says that the population doubles every 150 years

74
00:06:11,840 --> 00:06:17,540
Why assume such an arbitrary figure? Why not 80 or 200 or 120?

75
00:06:18,180 --> 00:06:20,860
Because answers in Genesis was working backwards

76
00:06:21,460 --> 00:06:26,700
the Bible gave it a starting population of eight people and a IG wanted to show that after

77
00:06:27,300 --> 00:06:31,060
4,500 years that population would expand to 6.5 billion

78
00:06:31,740 --> 00:06:34,100
Knowing the answer made the math very easy

79
00:06:34,460 --> 00:06:40,540
What rate of growth is required to get that answer turns out to be a doubling every 150 years?

80
00:06:41,340 --> 00:06:46,980
So then answers in Genesis turned the calculation around and started at the beginning if the population

81
00:06:47,540 --> 00:06:53,740
4,500 years ago was eight people and assuming a doubling of the population every oh, I don't know. Let's say

82
00:06:54,380 --> 00:06:57,180
150 years what population should we have today?

83
00:06:57,660 --> 00:07:04,300
Why it works out to 6.5 billion and since that's what we've got the Bible must be right

84
00:07:05,060 --> 00:07:08,900
Then using the same arbitrary doubling of population every 150 years

85
00:07:09,260 --> 00:07:13,540
What population would we have today if humans have been around for 40,000 years?

86
00:07:13,540 --> 00:07:16,680
There would not be enough space in the universe to hold that many bodies

87
00:07:16,680 --> 00:07:21,640
But of course a doubling of the population every 150 years never happened for most of human history

88
00:07:22,100 --> 00:07:27,340
Human populations expand according to the resources that are available to fuel that expansion

89
00:07:27,700 --> 00:07:34,140
Hunter-gatherers have very low population growth because the land can't support a large population of hunter-gatherers

90
00:07:34,420 --> 00:07:41,180
When the neolithic farming revolution came along populations grew because the same amount of land could support more people

91
00:07:41,180 --> 00:07:47,780
And when cities grew up in Egypt Mesopotamia India and China they could support larger populations still

92
00:07:48,380 --> 00:07:55,620
So prior to the neolithic human populations didn't grow very fast at all. They were constrained by the resources that fed them

93
00:07:56,500 --> 00:07:58,980
Into this mix you have to add the occasional mass

94
00:07:59,400 --> 00:08:00,260
Extermination

95
00:08:00,260 --> 00:08:08,020
Around 70,000 years ago a volcanic eruption in Sumatra caused global cooling which reduced the human population to as little as

96
00:08:08,260 --> 00:08:10,340
10,000 people in Africa and India

97
00:08:11,180 --> 00:08:18,460
Coming up with ideas about human population at the breakfast table is easy if you apply arbitrary numbers and do a bit of simple math

98
00:08:19,220 --> 00:08:22,580
Conducting careful research over decades doing more sophisticated

99
00:08:22,660 --> 00:08:29,660
Sophisticated mathematical calculations not making arbitrary assumptions and basing every conclusion on the evidence is much harder

100
00:08:29,780 --> 00:08:31,780
But the result stands up to scrutiny
