0	7320	I'll give you the truth. I'll give you the facts without spin.
7320	12680	Whenever YouTubers start a presentation with a statement like that, it's a red flag. Why
12680	16880	did they feel the need to make a great show of telling you how honest they are in the
16880	22280	same way that most undemocratic countries have to insist so forcefully that they're
22280	26480	democratic? Later in the video we'll check the guy in the beanie hat's sources and
26480	32360	see if he's as truthful as he claims to be. I was hoping to end this series on Covid,
32360	37960	but several people asked me to fact-check claims that PCR tests don't work, so without
37960	44100	further ado, let's go through the claims one by one, starting with this one, that PCR
44100	49580	tests can't distinguish between a live virus and a non-infectious virus. This picture going
49580	53920	around Facebook looks as though it comes from the Australian government, and in fact part
53920	60520	of it does. It can be found here. And this particular claim is true.
60520	66520	So we're off to a good start. PCR is a way of amplifying parts of DNA in order to make
66520	72360	sample sizes large enough to be identified. It can do the same thing with RNA, the stuff
72360	77540	SARS-CoV-2 is made of, by first converting it into DNA.
77540	82160	Now there is a method for estimating the viral load, and it's dependent on the number of
82160	88060	cycles a sample has to go through in order to be amplified enough for easy detection.
88060	93780	But that's a little technical. All we need to know is that PCR can detect a virus and
93780	100120	tell you whether someone is infected, but not necessarily whether they're still infectious.
100120	105420	But then the Facebook claim starts to unravel. This means the test cannot distinguish in
105420	114760	Covid from a cold or measles or Ebola. No, it doesn't mean that at all. And if you haven't
114760	119040	guessed, that part of the statement doesn't come from virologists advising the Department
119040	125640	of Health, it's just ungrammatical claptrap tacked on by some anonymous Facebook user
125640	131600	and then passed around. But hey, this is the internet, where ungrammatical claptrap is
131600	137140	just as good as scientific research. So if we want it to be true, all we have to do is
137140	144300	believe it and pass it on. Unfortunately, too many people don't use the internet as
144300	150820	a tool for serious investigation. It's a place where one person gets an idea and for no reason
150820	156560	other than a willingness to believe, someone copies it and passes it on. And before you
156560	161720	know it, it's gone viral and everyone is moving in the same direction without even
161720	168140	understanding how or why the movement got started. Do your own research basically means
168140	173300	checking to see if everyone else is following the same belief, and if they are, then it
173300	179220	must be right. So if you want to know what the internet would look like if it took human
179220	185260	form, it looks like this. I'll give you the truth. I'll give you the facts without spin.
185260	190100	Now Bloke Inbini looks like the kind of guy I'd love to have a beer with, but I wouldn't
190100	196420	necessarily trust him to give me the facts and the truth about polymerase chain reactions.
196420	201700	He was one of three video makers highlighted by the Australian newspaper as what it calls
201700	207280	an emerging group of coronavirus deniers telling its tens of thousands of followers that the
207280	213800	pandemic is a government conspiracy. Of course, Bloke Inbini is welcome to his opinion, but
213800	221240	he's not welcome to his own facts about PCR tests. Now these tests, the PCR testing wasn't
221240	229120	invented for the coronavirus or COVID-19 to specifically test for that. These tests were
229120	237320	invented way back for HIV and other things. Actually, they weren't designed for any specific
237320	243660	DNA or any specific virus, and certainly not for HIV, which wasn't even identified and
243660	250360	named until three years after PCR was invented. Carrie Mullis, the guy who came up with the
250360	256720	idea for PCR, and his colleagues, let's not forget, discovered a method for copying DNA
256720	262840	to make quantities that were easier to analyse. And that was a hugely useful tool in everything
262840	269300	from forensics and botany to tracing your personal ancestry. Identifying viruses was
269300	275660	simply another useful application. But now Bloke Inbini is going to quote Carrie Mullis
275660	282320	directly, so that should clear things up. Now, I'm just going to read you a quote from the
282320	288500	inventor of these tests. Now these tests... Hold on, he is going to quote Carrie Mullis,
288500	296300	just a minute. And this is directly quoted from the doctor or Carrie B. Mullis, the person who
296340	301180	invented these PCR tests. Okay, he's going to quote Carrie Mullis any second now. So what
301180	307380	Carrie B. Mullis says, Remy and Damon, you might want to sort of get out your little pens and
307380	311300	pencils and take... The Carrie Mullis quote is coming up now, this is it. I wouldn't even wipe
311300	319500	my bum with that, but anyway. Now, the PCR basically takes a sample of your cells and
319500	330500	amplifies any DNA, any DNA, to look for viral sequences, i.e. bits of non-human DNA that seem
330500	336180	to match parts of a known viral genome. Now, in case you're doubting that these are the words
336180	341980	of Carrie Mullis, just go to that source of the truth, the internet. Remember the mantra of
341980	348160	conspiracy theorists, do your own research. That means if we put part of the text into a search
348160	353560	engine and enough people are quoting the same thing, and all of them say it was written by
353560	359160	Carrie Mullis, then that must be true. I mean, surely Bloke Inbini isn't just reading some
359160	363600	nonsense he found on the internet, copied and pasted by someone else on the internet,
363600	368440	from something that had been mindlessly passed around the internet by hundreds of other people,
368440	374760	and not one of them bothered to fact check it, right? I mean, that would be too stupid for words.
374760	383760	PCR basically takes a sample of your cells and amplifies any DNA. The problem is the test is
383760	394800	known not to work. These are his words, not mine. It uses an amplification which means taking a
394800	401160	very, very tiny amount of DNA and growing it exponentially until it can be analysed.
401160	408120	Obviously any minute contaminations in the sample will also be amplified,
408120	417400	leading to potentially gross areas of discovery. The idea these kits can isolate a specific virus
417400	427280	like COVID-19 is nonsense. Well, as Bloke Inbini would say, the problem is that COVID-19 wasn't
427320	436160	named until February 2020, and Carrie Mullis died in August 2019. So you won't see any comment from
436160	442440	Carrie Mullis about COVID-19, and if you do, it's either a fake or it's the work of a mystic who's
442440	449080	managed to contact him from beyond the grave. In other words, also fake. So where does it come
449080	455120	from? Well, here's exactly the same chunk of text, but this time not attributed to Carrie Mullis,
455120	461840	but to a nurse speaking out. Here's the same chunk of text, this time pasted onto a forum
461840	467400	purporting to come from someone who works in the healthcare field. Over time the statement has been
467400	472680	attributed to a nurse, someone who works in the healthcare field, a widely respected professional
472680	479280	scientist, and of course the inventor of PCR dictating from beyond the grave. So where does
479280	484360	it really come from? I'll give you the truth. No thanks, you've had your chance. The best way
484360	490120	to find out who did write it is to put part of the text into the search bar again, and this time
490120	496040	use time parameters in the search engine. I kept tracking the quote back until I found what seems
496040	503400	to be the second oldest version of it in a March 21 blog called Revealing Fraud. It cited a blog
503400	510480	called Occam's Razor Terror Events, and there it was, sandwiched between 9-11 conspiracy theories
510480	517640	and claims that the pandemic is a hoax designed to exert mind control. So the author is a blogger.
517640	523920	Now that may sound like an impeccable source if you think that anything you read on a blog
523920	530600	must be true, but we can all agree it's not Carrie Mullis. So there you go, I thought I would just
530600	537440	clear that up for you, so if you'd like, you know, share this around for a bit of clarity. So even
537480	541760	though we know that Bloke Inbini's just passing on something he read on the internet without
541760	547840	checking it, and even though this quote doesn't come from Carrie Mullis, he's asking you to pass
547840	553640	it on without checking it, so that's not really clearing anything up, it's just acting like a
553640	560280	bunch of people who believe anything they see on the internet. There's also another quote attributed
560280	566040	to Carrie Mullis during the rounds, these PCR tests cannot detect free infectious viruses at
566040	573480	all. So is that one genuine? Well this one's being passed around by someone who laughably calls
573480	579960	himself to your own research, because of course the extent of his research was to read this on
579960	585960	a website and then repeat it. If he did any further research it was just to put the quote
585960	590920	into a search engine and discover that a lot of other people on the internet are also saying
590920	597120	Carrie Mullis said this, pass it along. And under internet rules, if enough people are
597120	604520	copying and pasting the same thing, then it must be true. But none of them say where the quote comes
604520	611400	from or what it's referring to. So let's not just follow the flock, let's do some proper research
611400	618840	and find out, again by tracking this disembodied quote back with a time search. It comes from this
618840	626760	1998 article by John Lauritsen about HIV AIDS. Not only was the quote wrongly attributed to
626760	633480	Carrie Mullis, Lauritsen's explanation of what he was talking about is entirely missing. So let's
633480	641480	put it back. Lauritsen never said PCR can't identify viruses but they can't measure the
641480	646760	quantity of viruses as we've seen. To use an analogy it's a bit like being asked to identify
647160	652520	what type of car is being produced at an auto plant. I can't tell you how many cars there
652520	658920	are in the plant's holding area but I can tell you what make and model they are. Okay, so let's
658920	664440	turn it over to the forum now. Does anyone have any questions? Yes, Julian French. Why are there
664440	668280	so many videos of empty hospitals? Why aren't we discussing healthy lifestyles? Where has the flu
668280	671960	gone? Why are the local elitists making billions of money? Okay, I mean questions about PCR.
672520	678920	Why did a Cambridge PCR test study of 10,000 people show 100% of their positives to be false?
679960	684680	Even though Julian French doesn't give a source for this information, of course he doesn't,
684680	689560	it was quite easy to find this copied and pasted around the echo chamber of the internet,
689560	694360	each time with a slightly different wording. So here's someone who posted the claim with
694360	700840	some figures. 9,000 plus students were tested at Cambridge University in the week up to December 6
700840	706600	and every single one was found to be a false positive after a second test. Wow,
707320	713880	so how many is that? Hundreds? Thousands? That's not conjecture, says the tweeter,
713880	720040	that's Cambridge's own data. So does that mean the writer actually did her own research?
720760	726680	Yes, because in internet land doing your own research means reading a tweet from someone else
726680	730840	and mindlessly passing it on. And here's the tweet she passed on.
731800	737480	100% false positive rate found at Cambridge University colleges following retests. The
737480	744760	truth is emerging very quickly now. Retweet. Nah, instead of mindlessly retweeting this dubious
744760	750360	claim, let's do some research and actually check the source it gives. In other words,
750360	756120	Cambridge's own data. Here it is. The false positive rate for all pooled screening tests
756120	763960	to date has been 1 in 373. 0.3%. That's very different to 100%.
765160	770360	The Twittersphere is out by a factor of over 300. So how did that happen?
771640	775320	Well, first we need to understand what a false positive rate is.
776040	784040	Here are 9,000 students, each figure representing 100 people, about to get tested. We'll say 1,000
784040	790680	of them have coronavirus and just focus on those who aren't infected. That means there are 8,000
790680	796600	people in the group who don't have coronavirus lining up to get tested. When the results of
796600	802280	the tests come in, they all show a negative result except for 200 people whose samples
802280	809640	are mistakenly read as positive. So these are false positives. That's what a false positive
809640	815880	means. It means you're negative but you mistakenly show up as a positive. So the way the false
815880	821400	positive rate is calculated is to take the number of false positives and divide it by the number of
821400	827880	false positives plus the number of true negatives. In our example, the false positive rate is
828600	836600	200 out of 8,000, or 2.5%. So how did the Twitters end up with 100%?
838040	844040	The first step to misrepresenting the Cambridge survey is to get the calculation wrong. Instead
844040	849000	of dividing the number of false positives by the number of negatives plus false positives,
849000	854200	which is the formula, whoever started this internet chatter divided the number of false
854200	860680	positives by the number of positives. The next step is a familiar device known as cherry picking.
861560	866600	Obviously, in a population with a very low infection rate, the number of true positives
866600	872440	is going to be very low. So the percentage of false positives over true positives will be
872440	877800	higher. When you get down to no infections at all, any positive readings you do get will,
877800	882440	of course, be false. So when the amateurs took a look at the weekly results from Cambridge
882440	888280	University, guess which week they cherry picked? Of course, the only week when there were no
888280	896120	infections at all. There were only 10 positives out of 9,376 people tested, and since no one was
896120	903080	infected, they were all false. So to answer Julian French's question, how come testing of 10,000
903080	909560	people show 100% of their positives to be false, the reason is that none of the nearly 10,000
909560	915720	people was infected according to testing. So dividing any false positive figure by itself,
916280	921400	even if it was just one false positive test out of a million people tested, would of course
921400	928520	automatically give you 100%. The real false positive rate for that week was just 0.1%.
930040	936520	And as we've seen for the totality of the survey, it was 0.3%, which is not far off other estimates
936520	940920	for false positive rates. You'll find these studies listed in the video description.
942200	947720	So here's a suggestion to people like Julian French, Good PR Anna, Do Your Own Research,
947720	953240	Julia Hartley-Brewer, and all the other members of the flock. If you read messages giving you
953240	959000	some information and telling you to pass it on, you've got three choices. Either you can ignore
959000	963560	it, which is a sensible thing to do if you don't know whether the information is true or not,
963560	967880	or you could follow the crowd and do as you're told and mindlessly pass it on,
968600	974280	or you spend just a few minutes checking the information by going to the source. See if it
974280	980440	says what the tweeters and retweeters and re-retweeters believe it says. Don't follow a
980440	987160	person, follow the information trail. It could be the start of a whole new experience of thinking
987160	994120	for yourself. If you'd like to donate money to this channel, please don't. The best way to
994120	999160	support it is to donate to a charity that I strongly endorse, which is detailed in the
999160	1004600	video description and on the link to this video. It provides healthcare for people living on the
1004600	1009800	edge of tropical forests in exchange for not cutting down trees, something they were forced
1009800	1015480	to do in the past to pay for medical treatment. It's had huge success in Indonesia and is now
1015480	1021000	expanding into Madagascar and Brazil. Thanks to all those who've donated in the past,
1021000	1022520	and intend to do so now.
