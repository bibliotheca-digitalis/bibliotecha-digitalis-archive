00:00.000 --> 00:07.320
I'll give you the truth. I'll give you the facts without spin.

00:07.320 --> 00:12.680
Whenever YouTubers start a presentation with a statement like that, it's a red flag. Why

00:12.680 --> 00:16.880
did they feel the need to make a great show of telling you how honest they are in the

00:16.880 --> 00:22.280
same way that most undemocratic countries have to insist so forcefully that they're

00:22.280 --> 00:26.480
democratic? Later in the video we'll check the guy in the beanie hat's sources and

00:26.480 --> 00:32.360
see if he's as truthful as he claims to be. I was hoping to end this series on Covid,

00:32.360 --> 00:37.960
but several people asked me to fact-check claims that PCR tests don't work, so without

00:37.960 --> 00:44.100
further ado, let's go through the claims one by one, starting with this one, that PCR

00:44.100 --> 00:49.580
tests can't distinguish between a live virus and a non-infectious virus. This picture going

00:49.580 --> 00:53.920
around Facebook looks as though it comes from the Australian government, and in fact part

00:53.920 --> 01:00.520
of it does. It can be found here. And this particular claim is true.

01:00.520 --> 01:06.520
So we're off to a good start. PCR is a way of amplifying parts of DNA in order to make

01:06.520 --> 01:12.360
sample sizes large enough to be identified. It can do the same thing with RNA, the stuff

01:12.360 --> 01:17.540
SARS-CoV-2 is made of, by first converting it into DNA.

01:17.540 --> 01:22.160
Now there is a method for estimating the viral load, and it's dependent on the number of

01:22.160 --> 01:28.060
cycles a sample has to go through in order to be amplified enough for easy detection.

01:28.060 --> 01:33.780
But that's a little technical. All we need to know is that PCR can detect a virus and

01:33.780 --> 01:40.120
tell you whether someone is infected, but not necessarily whether they're still infectious.

01:40.120 --> 01:45.420
But then the Facebook claim starts to unravel. This means the test cannot distinguish in

01:45.420 --> 01:54.760
Covid from a cold or measles or Ebola. No, it doesn't mean that at all. And if you haven't

01:54.760 --> 01:59.040
guessed, that part of the statement doesn't come from virologists advising the Department

01:59.040 --> 02:05.640
of Health, it's just ungrammatical claptrap tacked on by some anonymous Facebook user

02:05.640 --> 02:11.600
and then passed around. But hey, this is the internet, where ungrammatical claptrap is

02:11.600 --> 02:17.140
just as good as scientific research. So if we want it to be true, all we have to do is

02:17.140 --> 02:24.300
believe it and pass it on. Unfortunately, too many people don't use the internet as

02:24.300 --> 02:30.820
a tool for serious investigation. It's a place where one person gets an idea and for no reason

02:30.820 --> 02:36.560
other than a willingness to believe, someone copies it and passes it on. And before you

02:36.560 --> 02:41.720
know it, it's gone viral and everyone is moving in the same direction without even

02:41.720 --> 02:48.140
understanding how or why the movement got started. Do your own research basically means

02:48.140 --> 02:53.300
checking to see if everyone else is following the same belief, and if they are, then it

02:53.300 --> 02:59.220
must be right. So if you want to know what the internet would look like if it took human

02:59.220 --> 03:05.260
form, it looks like this. I'll give you the truth. I'll give you the facts without spin.

03:05.260 --> 03:10.100
Now Bloke Inbini looks like the kind of guy I'd love to have a beer with, but I wouldn't

03:10.100 --> 03:16.420
necessarily trust him to give me the facts and the truth about polymerase chain reactions.

03:16.420 --> 03:21.700
He was one of three video makers highlighted by the Australian newspaper as what it calls

03:21.700 --> 03:27.280
an emerging group of coronavirus deniers telling its tens of thousands of followers that the

03:27.280 --> 03:33.800
pandemic is a government conspiracy. Of course, Bloke Inbini is welcome to his opinion, but

03:33.800 --> 03:41.240
he's not welcome to his own facts about PCR tests. Now these tests, the PCR testing wasn't

03:41.240 --> 03:49.120
invented for the coronavirus or COVID-19 to specifically test for that. These tests were

03:49.120 --> 03:57.320
invented way back for HIV and other things. Actually, they weren't designed for any specific

03:57.320 --> 04:03.660
DNA or any specific virus, and certainly not for HIV, which wasn't even identified and

04:03.660 --> 04:10.360
named until three years after PCR was invented. Carrie Mullis, the guy who came up with the

04:10.360 --> 04:16.720
idea for PCR, and his colleagues, let's not forget, discovered a method for copying DNA

04:16.720 --> 04:22.840
to make quantities that were easier to analyse. And that was a hugely useful tool in everything

04:22.840 --> 04:29.300
from forensics and botany to tracing your personal ancestry. Identifying viruses was

04:29.300 --> 04:35.660
simply another useful application. But now Bloke Inbini is going to quote Carrie Mullis

04:35.660 --> 04:42.320
directly, so that should clear things up. Now, I'm just going to read you a quote from the

04:42.320 --> 04:48.500
inventor of these tests. Now these tests... Hold on, he is going to quote Carrie Mullis,

04:48.500 --> 04:56.300
just a minute. And this is directly quoted from the doctor or Carrie B. Mullis, the person who

04:56.340 --> 05:01.180
invented these PCR tests. Okay, he's going to quote Carrie Mullis any second now. So what

05:01.180 --> 05:07.380
Carrie B. Mullis says, Remy and Damon, you might want to sort of get out your little pens and

05:07.380 --> 05:11.300
pencils and take... The Carrie Mullis quote is coming up now, this is it. I wouldn't even wipe

05:11.300 --> 05:19.500
my bum with that, but anyway. Now, the PCR basically takes a sample of your cells and

05:19.500 --> 05:30.500
amplifies any DNA, any DNA, to look for viral sequences, i.e. bits of non-human DNA that seem

05:30.500 --> 05:36.180
to match parts of a known viral genome. Now, in case you're doubting that these are the words

05:36.180 --> 05:41.980
of Carrie Mullis, just go to that source of the truth, the internet. Remember the mantra of

05:41.980 --> 05:48.160
conspiracy theorists, do your own research. That means if we put part of the text into a search

05:48.160 --> 05:53.560
engine and enough people are quoting the same thing, and all of them say it was written by

05:53.560 --> 05:59.160
Carrie Mullis, then that must be true. I mean, surely Bloke Inbini isn't just reading some

05:59.160 --> 06:03.600
nonsense he found on the internet, copied and pasted by someone else on the internet,

06:03.600 --> 06:08.440
from something that had been mindlessly passed around the internet by hundreds of other people,

06:08.440 --> 06:14.760
and not one of them bothered to fact check it, right? I mean, that would be too stupid for words.

06:14.760 --> 06:23.760
PCR basically takes a sample of your cells and amplifies any DNA. The problem is the test is

06:23.760 --> 06:34.800
known not to work. These are his words, not mine. It uses an amplification which means taking a

06:34.800 --> 06:41.160
very, very tiny amount of DNA and growing it exponentially until it can be analysed.

06:41.160 --> 06:48.120
Obviously any minute contaminations in the sample will also be amplified,

06:48.120 --> 06:57.400
leading to potentially gross areas of discovery. The idea these kits can isolate a specific virus

06:57.400 --> 07:07.280
like COVID-19 is nonsense. Well, as Bloke Inbini would say, the problem is that COVID-19 wasn't

07:07.320 --> 07:16.160
named until February 2020, and Carrie Mullis died in August 2019. So you won't see any comment from

07:16.160 --> 07:22.440
Carrie Mullis about COVID-19, and if you do, it's either a fake or it's the work of a mystic who's

07:22.440 --> 07:29.080
managed to contact him from beyond the grave. In other words, also fake. So where does it come

07:29.080 --> 07:35.120
from? Well, here's exactly the same chunk of text, but this time not attributed to Carrie Mullis,

07:35.120 --> 07:41.840
but to a nurse speaking out. Here's the same chunk of text, this time pasted onto a forum

07:41.840 --> 07:47.400
purporting to come from someone who works in the healthcare field. Over time the statement has been

07:47.400 --> 07:52.680
attributed to a nurse, someone who works in the healthcare field, a widely respected professional

07:52.680 --> 07:59.280
scientist, and of course the inventor of PCR dictating from beyond the grave. So where does

07:59.280 --> 08:04.360
it really come from? I'll give you the truth. No thanks, you've had your chance. The best way

08:04.360 --> 08:10.120
to find out who did write it is to put part of the text into the search bar again, and this time

08:10.120 --> 08:16.040
use time parameters in the search engine. I kept tracking the quote back until I found what seems

08:16.040 --> 08:23.400
to be the second oldest version of it in a March 21 blog called Revealing Fraud. It cited a blog

08:23.400 --> 08:30.480
called Occam's Razor Terror Events, and there it was, sandwiched between 9-11 conspiracy theories

08:30.480 --> 08:37.640
and claims that the pandemic is a hoax designed to exert mind control. So the author is a blogger.

08:37.640 --> 08:43.920
Now that may sound like an impeccable source if you think that anything you read on a blog

08:43.920 --> 08:50.600
must be true, but we can all agree it's not Carrie Mullis. So there you go, I thought I would just

08:50.600 --> 08:57.440
clear that up for you, so if you'd like, you know, share this around for a bit of clarity. So even

08:57.480 --> 09:01.760
though we know that Bloke Inbini's just passing on something he read on the internet without

09:01.760 --> 09:07.840
checking it, and even though this quote doesn't come from Carrie Mullis, he's asking you to pass

09:07.840 --> 09:13.640
it on without checking it, so that's not really clearing anything up, it's just acting like a

09:13.640 --> 09:20.280
bunch of people who believe anything they see on the internet. There's also another quote attributed

09:20.280 --> 09:26.040
to Carrie Mullis during the rounds, these PCR tests cannot detect free infectious viruses at

09:26.040 --> 09:33.480
all. So is that one genuine? Well this one's being passed around by someone who laughably calls

09:33.480 --> 09:39.960
himself to your own research, because of course the extent of his research was to read this on

09:39.960 --> 09:45.960
a website and then repeat it. If he did any further research it was just to put the quote

09:45.960 --> 09:50.920
into a search engine and discover that a lot of other people on the internet are also saying

09:50.920 --> 09:57.120
Carrie Mullis said this, pass it along. And under internet rules, if enough people are

09:57.120 --> 10:04.520
copying and pasting the same thing, then it must be true. But none of them say where the quote comes

10:04.520 --> 10:11.400
from or what it's referring to. So let's not just follow the flock, let's do some proper research

10:11.400 --> 10:18.840
and find out, again by tracking this disembodied quote back with a time search. It comes from this

10:18.840 --> 10:26.760
1998 article by John Lauritsen about HIV AIDS. Not only was the quote wrongly attributed to

10:26.760 --> 10:33.480
Carrie Mullis, Lauritsen's explanation of what he was talking about is entirely missing. So let's

10:33.480 --> 10:41.480
put it back. Lauritsen never said PCR can't identify viruses but they can't measure the

10:41.480 --> 10:46.760
quantity of viruses as we've seen. To use an analogy it's a bit like being asked to identify

10:47.160 --> 10:52.520
what type of car is being produced at an auto plant. I can't tell you how many cars there

10:52.520 --> 10:58.920
are in the plant's holding area but I can tell you what make and model they are. Okay, so let's

10:58.920 --> 11:04.440
turn it over to the forum now. Does anyone have any questions? Yes, Julian French. Why are there

11:04.440 --> 11:08.280
so many videos of empty hospitals? Why aren't we discussing healthy lifestyles? Where has the flu

11:08.280 --> 11:11.960
gone? Why are the local elitists making billions of money? Okay, I mean questions about PCR.

11:12.520 --> 11:18.920
Why did a Cambridge PCR test study of 10,000 people show 100% of their positives to be false?

11:19.960 --> 11:24.680
Even though Julian French doesn't give a source for this information, of course he doesn't,

11:24.680 --> 11:29.560
it was quite easy to find this copied and pasted around the echo chamber of the internet,

11:29.560 --> 11:34.360
each time with a slightly different wording. So here's someone who posted the claim with

11:34.360 --> 11:40.840
some figures. 9,000 plus students were tested at Cambridge University in the week up to December 6

11:40.840 --> 11:46.600
and every single one was found to be a false positive after a second test. Wow,

11:47.320 --> 11:53.880
so how many is that? Hundreds? Thousands? That's not conjecture, says the tweeter,

11:53.880 --> 12:00.040
that's Cambridge's own data. So does that mean the writer actually did her own research?

12:00.760 --> 12:06.680
Yes, because in internet land doing your own research means reading a tweet from someone else

12:06.680 --> 12:10.840
and mindlessly passing it on. And here's the tweet she passed on.

12:11.800 --> 12:17.480
100% false positive rate found at Cambridge University colleges following retests. The

12:17.480 --> 12:24.760
truth is emerging very quickly now. Retweet. Nah, instead of mindlessly retweeting this dubious

12:24.760 --> 12:30.360
claim, let's do some research and actually check the source it gives. In other words,

12:30.360 --> 12:36.120
Cambridge's own data. Here it is. The false positive rate for all pooled screening tests

12:36.120 --> 12:43.960
to date has been 1 in 373. 0.3%. That's very different to 100%.

12:45.160 --> 12:50.360
The Twittersphere is out by a factor of over 300. So how did that happen?

12:51.640 --> 12:55.320
Well, first we need to understand what a false positive rate is.

12:56.040 --> 13:04.040
Here are 9,000 students, each figure representing 100 people, about to get tested. We'll say 1,000

13:04.040 --> 13:10.680
of them have coronavirus and just focus on those who aren't infected. That means there are 8,000

13:10.680 --> 13:16.600
people in the group who don't have coronavirus lining up to get tested. When the results of

13:16.600 --> 13:22.280
the tests come in, they all show a negative result except for 200 people whose samples

13:22.280 --> 13:29.640
are mistakenly read as positive. So these are false positives. That's what a false positive

13:29.640 --> 13:35.880
means. It means you're negative but you mistakenly show up as a positive. So the way the false

13:35.880 --> 13:41.400
positive rate is calculated is to take the number of false positives and divide it by the number of

13:41.400 --> 13:47.880
false positives plus the number of true negatives. In our example, the false positive rate is

13:48.600 --> 13:56.600
200 out of 8,000, or 2.5%. So how did the Twitters end up with 100%?

13:58.040 --> 14:04.040
The first step to misrepresenting the Cambridge survey is to get the calculation wrong. Instead

14:04.040 --> 14:09.000
of dividing the number of false positives by the number of negatives plus false positives,

14:09.000 --> 14:14.200
which is the formula, whoever started this internet chatter divided the number of false

14:14.200 --> 14:20.680
positives by the number of positives. The next step is a familiar device known as cherry picking.

14:21.560 --> 14:26.600
Obviously, in a population with a very low infection rate, the number of true positives

14:26.600 --> 14:32.440
is going to be very low. So the percentage of false positives over true positives will be

14:32.440 --> 14:37.800
higher. When you get down to no infections at all, any positive readings you do get will,

14:37.800 --> 14:42.440
of course, be false. So when the amateurs took a look at the weekly results from Cambridge

14:42.440 --> 14:48.280
University, guess which week they cherry picked? Of course, the only week when there were no

14:48.280 --> 14:56.120
infections at all. There were only 10 positives out of 9,376 people tested, and since no one was

14:56.120 --> 15:03.080
infected, they were all false. So to answer Julian French's question, how come testing of 10,000

15:03.080 --> 15:09.560
people show 100% of their positives to be false, the reason is that none of the nearly 10,000

15:09.560 --> 15:15.720
people was infected according to testing. So dividing any false positive figure by itself,

15:16.280 --> 15:21.400
even if it was just one false positive test out of a million people tested, would of course

15:21.400 --> 15:28.520
automatically give you 100%. The real false positive rate for that week was just 0.1%.

15:30.040 --> 15:36.520
And as we've seen for the totality of the survey, it was 0.3%, which is not far off other estimates

15:36.520 --> 15:40.920
for false positive rates. You'll find these studies listed in the video description.

15:42.200 --> 15:47.720
So here's a suggestion to people like Julian French, Good PR Anna, Do Your Own Research,

15:47.720 --> 15:53.240
Julia Hartley-Brewer, and all the other members of the flock. If you read messages giving you

15:53.240 --> 15:59.000
some information and telling you to pass it on, you've got three choices. Either you can ignore

15:59.000 --> 16:03.560
it, which is a sensible thing to do if you don't know whether the information is true or not,

16:03.560 --> 16:07.880
or you could follow the crowd and do as you're told and mindlessly pass it on,

16:08.600 --> 16:14.280
or you spend just a few minutes checking the information by going to the source. See if it

16:14.280 --> 16:20.440
says what the tweeters and retweeters and re-retweeters believe it says. Don't follow a

16:20.440 --> 16:27.160
person, follow the information trail. It could be the start of a whole new experience of thinking

16:27.160 --> 16:34.120
for yourself. If you'd like to donate money to this channel, please don't. The best way to

16:34.120 --> 16:39.160
support it is to donate to a charity that I strongly endorse, which is detailed in the

16:39.160 --> 16:44.600
video description and on the link to this video. It provides healthcare for people living on the

16:44.600 --> 16:49.800
edge of tropical forests in exchange for not cutting down trees, something they were forced

16:49.800 --> 16:55.480
to do in the past to pay for medical treatment. It's had huge success in Indonesia and is now

16:55.480 --> 17:01.000
expanding into Madagascar and Brazil. Thanks to all those who've donated in the past,

17:01.000 --> 17:02.520
and intend to do so now.
