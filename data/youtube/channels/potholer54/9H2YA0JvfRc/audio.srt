1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,320
I'll give you the truth. I'll give you the facts without spin.

2
00:00:07,320 --> 00:00:12,680
Whenever YouTubers start a presentation with a statement like that, it's a red flag. Why

3
00:00:12,680 --> 00:00:16,880
did they feel the need to make a great show of telling you how honest they are in the

4
00:00:16,880 --> 00:00:22,280
same way that most undemocratic countries have to insist so forcefully that they're

5
00:00:22,280 --> 00:00:26,480
democratic? Later in the video we'll check the guy in the beanie hat's sources and

6
00:00:26,480 --> 00:00:32,360
see if he's as truthful as he claims to be. I was hoping to end this series on Covid,

7
00:00:32,360 --> 00:00:37,960
but several people asked me to fact-check claims that PCR tests don't work, so without

8
00:00:37,960 --> 00:00:44,100
further ado, let's go through the claims one by one, starting with this one, that PCR

9
00:00:44,100 --> 00:00:49,580
tests can't distinguish between a live virus and a non-infectious virus. This picture going

10
00:00:49,580 --> 00:00:53,920
around Facebook looks as though it comes from the Australian government, and in fact part

11
00:00:53,920 --> 00:01:00,520
of it does. It can be found here. And this particular claim is true.

12
00:01:00,520 --> 00:01:06,520
So we're off to a good start. PCR is a way of amplifying parts of DNA in order to make

13
00:01:06,520 --> 00:01:12,360
sample sizes large enough to be identified. It can do the same thing with RNA, the stuff

14
00:01:12,360 --> 00:01:17,540
SARS-CoV-2 is made of, by first converting it into DNA.

15
00:01:17,540 --> 00:01:22,160
Now there is a method for estimating the viral load, and it's dependent on the number of

16
00:01:22,160 --> 00:01:28,060
cycles a sample has to go through in order to be amplified enough for easy detection.

17
00:01:28,060 --> 00:01:33,780
But that's a little technical. All we need to know is that PCR can detect a virus and

18
00:01:33,780 --> 00:01:40,120
tell you whether someone is infected, but not necessarily whether they're still infectious.

19
00:01:40,120 --> 00:01:45,420
But then the Facebook claim starts to unravel. This means the test cannot distinguish in

20
00:01:45,420 --> 00:01:54,760
Covid from a cold or measles or Ebola. No, it doesn't mean that at all. And if you haven't

21
00:01:54,760 --> 00:01:59,040
guessed, that part of the statement doesn't come from virologists advising the Department

22
00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:05,640
of Health, it's just ungrammatical claptrap tacked on by some anonymous Facebook user

23
00:02:05,640 --> 00:02:11,600
and then passed around. But hey, this is the internet, where ungrammatical claptrap is

24
00:02:11,600 --> 00:02:17,140
just as good as scientific research. So if we want it to be true, all we have to do is

25
00:02:17,140 --> 00:02:24,300
believe it and pass it on. Unfortunately, too many people don't use the internet as

26
00:02:24,300 --> 00:02:30,820
a tool for serious investigation. It's a place where one person gets an idea and for no reason

27
00:02:30,820 --> 00:02:36,560
other than a willingness to believe, someone copies it and passes it on. And before you

28
00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:41,720
know it, it's gone viral and everyone is moving in the same direction without even

29
00:02:41,720 --> 00:02:48,140
understanding how or why the movement got started. Do your own research basically means

30
00:02:48,140 --> 00:02:53,300
checking to see if everyone else is following the same belief, and if they are, then it

31
00:02:53,300 --> 00:02:59,220
must be right. So if you want to know what the internet would look like if it took human

32
00:02:59,220 --> 00:03:05,260
form, it looks like this. I'll give you the truth. I'll give you the facts without spin.

33
00:03:05,260 --> 00:03:10,100
Now Bloke Inbini looks like the kind of guy I'd love to have a beer with, but I wouldn't

34
00:03:10,100 --> 00:03:16,420
necessarily trust him to give me the facts and the truth about polymerase chain reactions.

35
00:03:16,420 --> 00:03:21,700
He was one of three video makers highlighted by the Australian newspaper as what it calls

36
00:03:21,700 --> 00:03:27,280
an emerging group of coronavirus deniers telling its tens of thousands of followers that the

37
00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:33,800
pandemic is a government conspiracy. Of course, Bloke Inbini is welcome to his opinion, but

38
00:03:33,800 --> 00:03:41,240
he's not welcome to his own facts about PCR tests. Now these tests, the PCR testing wasn't

39
00:03:41,240 --> 00:03:49,120
invented for the coronavirus or COVID-19 to specifically test for that. These tests were

40
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:57,320
invented way back for HIV and other things. Actually, they weren't designed for any specific

41
00:03:57,320 --> 00:04:03,660
DNA or any specific virus, and certainly not for HIV, which wasn't even identified and

42
00:04:03,660 --> 00:04:10,360
named until three years after PCR was invented. Carrie Mullis, the guy who came up with the

43
00:04:10,360 --> 00:04:16,720
idea for PCR, and his colleagues, let's not forget, discovered a method for copying DNA

44
00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:22,840
to make quantities that were easier to analyse. And that was a hugely useful tool in everything

45
00:04:22,840 --> 00:04:29,300
from forensics and botany to tracing your personal ancestry. Identifying viruses was

46
00:04:29,300 --> 00:04:35,660
simply another useful application. But now Bloke Inbini is going to quote Carrie Mullis

47
00:04:35,660 --> 00:04:42,320
directly, so that should clear things up. Now, I'm just going to read you a quote from the

48
00:04:42,320 --> 00:04:48,500
inventor of these tests. Now these tests... Hold on, he is going to quote Carrie Mullis,

49
00:04:48,500 --> 00:04:56,300
just a minute. And this is directly quoted from the doctor or Carrie B. Mullis, the person who

50
00:04:56,340 --> 00:05:01,180
invented these PCR tests. Okay, he's going to quote Carrie Mullis any second now. So what

51
00:05:01,180 --> 00:05:07,380
Carrie B. Mullis says, Remy and Damon, you might want to sort of get out your little pens and

52
00:05:07,380 --> 00:05:11,300
pencils and take... The Carrie Mullis quote is coming up now, this is it. I wouldn't even wipe

53
00:05:11,300 --> 00:05:19,500
my bum with that, but anyway. Now, the PCR basically takes a sample of your cells and

54
00:05:19,500 --> 00:05:30,500
amplifies any DNA, any DNA, to look for viral sequences, i.e. bits of non-human DNA that seem

55
00:05:30,500 --> 00:05:36,180
to match parts of a known viral genome. Now, in case you're doubting that these are the words

56
00:05:36,180 --> 00:05:41,980
of Carrie Mullis, just go to that source of the truth, the internet. Remember the mantra of

57
00:05:41,980 --> 00:05:48,160
conspiracy theorists, do your own research. That means if we put part of the text into a search

58
00:05:48,160 --> 00:05:53,560
engine and enough people are quoting the same thing, and all of them say it was written by

59
00:05:53,560 --> 00:05:59,160
Carrie Mullis, then that must be true. I mean, surely Bloke Inbini isn't just reading some

60
00:05:59,160 --> 00:06:03,600
nonsense he found on the internet, copied and pasted by someone else on the internet,

61
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:08,440
from something that had been mindlessly passed around the internet by hundreds of other people,

62
00:06:08,440 --> 00:06:14,760
and not one of them bothered to fact check it, right? I mean, that would be too stupid for words.

63
00:06:14,760 --> 00:06:23,760
PCR basically takes a sample of your cells and amplifies any DNA. The problem is the test is

64
00:06:23,760 --> 00:06:34,800
known not to work. These are his words, not mine. It uses an amplification which means taking a

65
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:41,160
very, very tiny amount of DNA and growing it exponentially until it can be analysed.

66
00:06:41,160 --> 00:06:48,120
Obviously any minute contaminations in the sample will also be amplified,

67
00:06:48,120 --> 00:06:57,400
leading to potentially gross areas of discovery. The idea these kits can isolate a specific virus

68
00:06:57,400 --> 00:07:07,280
like COVID-19 is nonsense. Well, as Bloke Inbini would say, the problem is that COVID-19 wasn't

69
00:07:07,320 --> 00:07:16,160
named until February 2020, and Carrie Mullis died in August 2019. So you won't see any comment from

70
00:07:16,160 --> 00:07:22,440
Carrie Mullis about COVID-19, and if you do, it's either a fake or it's the work of a mystic who's

71
00:07:22,440 --> 00:07:29,080
managed to contact him from beyond the grave. In other words, also fake. So where does it come

72
00:07:29,080 --> 00:07:35,120
from? Well, here's exactly the same chunk of text, but this time not attributed to Carrie Mullis,

73
00:07:35,120 --> 00:07:41,840
but to a nurse speaking out. Here's the same chunk of text, this time pasted onto a forum

74
00:07:41,840 --> 00:07:47,400
purporting to come from someone who works in the healthcare field. Over time the statement has been

75
00:07:47,400 --> 00:07:52,680
attributed to a nurse, someone who works in the healthcare field, a widely respected professional

76
00:07:52,680 --> 00:07:59,280
scientist, and of course the inventor of PCR dictating from beyond the grave. So where does

77
00:07:59,280 --> 00:08:04,360
it really come from? I'll give you the truth. No thanks, you've had your chance. The best way

78
00:08:04,360 --> 00:08:10,120
to find out who did write it is to put part of the text into the search bar again, and this time

79
00:08:10,120 --> 00:08:16,040
use time parameters in the search engine. I kept tracking the quote back until I found what seems

80
00:08:16,040 --> 00:08:23,400
to be the second oldest version of it in a March 21 blog called Revealing Fraud. It cited a blog

81
00:08:23,400 --> 00:08:30,480
called Occam's Razor Terror Events, and there it was, sandwiched between 9-11 conspiracy theories

82
00:08:30,480 --> 00:08:37,640
and claims that the pandemic is a hoax designed to exert mind control. So the author is a blogger.

83
00:08:37,640 --> 00:08:43,920
Now that may sound like an impeccable source if you think that anything you read on a blog

84
00:08:43,920 --> 00:08:50,600
must be true, but we can all agree it's not Carrie Mullis. So there you go, I thought I would just

85
00:08:50,600 --> 00:08:57,440
clear that up for you, so if you'd like, you know, share this around for a bit of clarity. So even

86
00:08:57,480 --> 00:09:01,760
though we know that Bloke Inbini's just passing on something he read on the internet without

87
00:09:01,760 --> 00:09:07,840
checking it, and even though this quote doesn't come from Carrie Mullis, he's asking you to pass

88
00:09:07,840 --> 00:09:13,640
it on without checking it, so that's not really clearing anything up, it's just acting like a

89
00:09:13,640 --> 00:09:20,280
bunch of people who believe anything they see on the internet. There's also another quote attributed

90
00:09:20,280 --> 00:09:26,040
to Carrie Mullis during the rounds, these PCR tests cannot detect free infectious viruses at

91
00:09:26,040 --> 00:09:33,480
all. So is that one genuine? Well this one's being passed around by someone who laughably calls

92
00:09:33,480 --> 00:09:39,960
himself to your own research, because of course the extent of his research was to read this on

93
00:09:39,960 --> 00:09:45,960
a website and then repeat it. If he did any further research it was just to put the quote

94
00:09:45,960 --> 00:09:50,920
into a search engine and discover that a lot of other people on the internet are also saying

95
00:09:50,920 --> 00:09:57,120
Carrie Mullis said this, pass it along. And under internet rules, if enough people are

96
00:09:57,120 --> 00:10:04,520
copying and pasting the same thing, then it must be true. But none of them say where the quote comes

97
00:10:04,520 --> 00:10:11,400
from or what it's referring to. So let's not just follow the flock, let's do some proper research

98
00:10:11,400 --> 00:10:18,840
and find out, again by tracking this disembodied quote back with a time search. It comes from this

99
00:10:18,840 --> 00:10:26,760
1998 article by John Lauritsen about HIV AIDS. Not only was the quote wrongly attributed to

100
00:10:26,760 --> 00:10:33,480
Carrie Mullis, Lauritsen's explanation of what he was talking about is entirely missing. So let's

101
00:10:33,480 --> 00:10:41,480
put it back. Lauritsen never said PCR can't identify viruses but they can't measure the

102
00:10:41,480 --> 00:10:46,760
quantity of viruses as we've seen. To use an analogy it's a bit like being asked to identify

103
00:10:47,160 --> 00:10:52,520
what type of car is being produced at an auto plant. I can't tell you how many cars there

104
00:10:52,520 --> 00:10:58,920
are in the plant's holding area but I can tell you what make and model they are. Okay, so let's

105
00:10:58,920 --> 00:11:04,440
turn it over to the forum now. Does anyone have any questions? Yes, Julian French. Why are there

106
00:11:04,440 --> 00:11:08,280
so many videos of empty hospitals? Why aren't we discussing healthy lifestyles? Where has the flu

107
00:11:08,280 --> 00:11:11,960
gone? Why are the local elitists making billions of money? Okay, I mean questions about PCR.

108
00:11:12,520 --> 00:11:18,920
Why did a Cambridge PCR test study of 10,000 people show 100% of their positives to be false?

109
00:11:19,960 --> 00:11:24,680
Even though Julian French doesn't give a source for this information, of course he doesn't,

110
00:11:24,680 --> 00:11:29,560
it was quite easy to find this copied and pasted around the echo chamber of the internet,

111
00:11:29,560 --> 00:11:34,360
each time with a slightly different wording. So here's someone who posted the claim with

112
00:11:34,360 --> 00:11:40,840
some figures. 9,000 plus students were tested at Cambridge University in the week up to December 6

113
00:11:40,840 --> 00:11:46,600
and every single one was found to be a false positive after a second test. Wow,

114
00:11:47,320 --> 00:11:53,880
so how many is that? Hundreds? Thousands? That's not conjecture, says the tweeter,

115
00:11:53,880 --> 00:12:00,040
that's Cambridge's own data. So does that mean the writer actually did her own research?

116
00:12:00,760 --> 00:12:06,680
Yes, because in internet land doing your own research means reading a tweet from someone else

117
00:12:06,680 --> 00:12:10,840
and mindlessly passing it on. And here's the tweet she passed on.

118
00:12:11,800 --> 00:12:17,480
100% false positive rate found at Cambridge University colleges following retests. The

119
00:12:17,480 --> 00:12:24,760
truth is emerging very quickly now. Retweet. Nah, instead of mindlessly retweeting this dubious

120
00:12:24,760 --> 00:12:30,360
claim, let's do some research and actually check the source it gives. In other words,

121
00:12:30,360 --> 00:12:36,120
Cambridge's own data. Here it is. The false positive rate for all pooled screening tests

122
00:12:36,120 --> 00:12:43,960
to date has been 1 in 373. 0.3%. That's very different to 100%.

123
00:12:45,160 --> 00:12:50,360
The Twittersphere is out by a factor of over 300. So how did that happen?

124
00:12:51,640 --> 00:12:55,320
Well, first we need to understand what a false positive rate is.

125
00:12:56,040 --> 00:13:04,040
Here are 9,000 students, each figure representing 100 people, about to get tested. We'll say 1,000

126
00:13:04,040 --> 00:13:10,680
of them have coronavirus and just focus on those who aren't infected. That means there are 8,000

127
00:13:10,680 --> 00:13:16,600
people in the group who don't have coronavirus lining up to get tested. When the results of

128
00:13:16,600 --> 00:13:22,280
the tests come in, they all show a negative result except for 200 people whose samples

129
00:13:22,280 --> 00:13:29,640
are mistakenly read as positive. So these are false positives. That's what a false positive

130
00:13:29,640 --> 00:13:35,880
means. It means you're negative but you mistakenly show up as a positive. So the way the false

131
00:13:35,880 --> 00:13:41,400
positive rate is calculated is to take the number of false positives and divide it by the number of

132
00:13:41,400 --> 00:13:47,880
false positives plus the number of true negatives. In our example, the false positive rate is

133
00:13:48,600 --> 00:13:56,600
200 out of 8,000, or 2.5%. So how did the Twitters end up with 100%?

134
00:13:58,040 --> 00:14:04,040
The first step to misrepresenting the Cambridge survey is to get the calculation wrong. Instead

135
00:14:04,040 --> 00:14:09,000
of dividing the number of false positives by the number of negatives plus false positives,

136
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:14,200
which is the formula, whoever started this internet chatter divided the number of false

137
00:14:14,200 --> 00:14:20,680
positives by the number of positives. The next step is a familiar device known as cherry picking.

138
00:14:21,560 --> 00:14:26,600
Obviously, in a population with a very low infection rate, the number of true positives

139
00:14:26,600 --> 00:14:32,440
is going to be very low. So the percentage of false positives over true positives will be

140
00:14:32,440 --> 00:14:37,800
higher. When you get down to no infections at all, any positive readings you do get will,

141
00:14:37,800 --> 00:14:42,440
of course, be false. So when the amateurs took a look at the weekly results from Cambridge

142
00:14:42,440 --> 00:14:48,280
University, guess which week they cherry picked? Of course, the only week when there were no

143
00:14:48,280 --> 00:14:56,120
infections at all. There were only 10 positives out of 9,376 people tested, and since no one was

144
00:14:56,120 --> 00:15:03,080
infected, they were all false. So to answer Julian French's question, how come testing of 10,000

145
00:15:03,080 --> 00:15:09,560
people show 100% of their positives to be false, the reason is that none of the nearly 10,000

146
00:15:09,560 --> 00:15:15,720
people was infected according to testing. So dividing any false positive figure by itself,

147
00:15:16,280 --> 00:15:21,400
even if it was just one false positive test out of a million people tested, would of course

148
00:15:21,400 --> 00:15:28,520
automatically give you 100%. The real false positive rate for that week was just 0.1%.

149
00:15:30,040 --> 00:15:36,520
And as we've seen for the totality of the survey, it was 0.3%, which is not far off other estimates

150
00:15:36,520 --> 00:15:40,920
for false positive rates. You'll find these studies listed in the video description.

151
00:15:42,200 --> 00:15:47,720
So here's a suggestion to people like Julian French, Good PR Anna, Do Your Own Research,

152
00:15:47,720 --> 00:15:53,240
Julia Hartley-Brewer, and all the other members of the flock. If you read messages giving you

153
00:15:53,240 --> 00:15:59,000
some information and telling you to pass it on, you've got three choices. Either you can ignore

154
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:03,560
it, which is a sensible thing to do if you don't know whether the information is true or not,

155
00:16:03,560 --> 00:16:07,880
or you could follow the crowd and do as you're told and mindlessly pass it on,

156
00:16:08,600 --> 00:16:14,280
or you spend just a few minutes checking the information by going to the source. See if it

157
00:16:14,280 --> 00:16:20,440
says what the tweeters and retweeters and re-retweeters believe it says. Don't follow a

158
00:16:20,440 --> 00:16:27,160
person, follow the information trail. It could be the start of a whole new experience of thinking

159
00:16:27,160 --> 00:16:34,120
for yourself. If you'd like to donate money to this channel, please don't. The best way to

160
00:16:34,120 --> 00:16:39,160
support it is to donate to a charity that I strongly endorse, which is detailed in the

161
00:16:39,160 --> 00:16:44,600
video description and on the link to this video. It provides healthcare for people living on the

162
00:16:44,600 --> 00:16:49,800
edge of tropical forests in exchange for not cutting down trees, something they were forced

163
00:16:49,800 --> 00:16:55,480
to do in the past to pay for medical treatment. It's had huge success in Indonesia and is now

164
00:16:55,480 --> 00:17:01,000
expanding into Madagascar and Brazil. Thanks to all those who've donated in the past,

165
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:02,520
and intend to do so now.
