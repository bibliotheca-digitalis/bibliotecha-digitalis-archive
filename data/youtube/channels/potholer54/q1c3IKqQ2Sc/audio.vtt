00:00.000 --> 00:06.560
I'm still getting lots of posts from people who think volcanoes emit more CO2 than humans.

00:06.560 --> 00:12.120
Even after I busted this popular myth in my video, are humans contributing only 3% of

00:12.120 --> 00:14.580
CO2 in the atmosphere?

00:14.580 --> 00:19.840
So in this video I'll track down the man who started the myth, and at the end I'll explain

00:19.840 --> 00:23.400
why there's been such a long gap since my last video.

00:23.400 --> 00:25.680
Thanks for your patience.

00:25.680 --> 00:30.880
Let's start with this poster who claims that 40 volcanoes have been erupting under Antarctica

00:30.880 --> 00:36.520
and emitted more CO2 than humans ever have in just two months.

00:36.520 --> 00:42.640
And another, more vague claim that anthropogenic climate change is a boogeyman because, well,

00:42.640 --> 00:47.600
just look at the amount of CO2 produced by just one volcanic eruption.

00:47.600 --> 00:50.520
Which is fair enough, let's look.

00:50.520 --> 00:54.280
Take the eruption of Mount St Helens in 1980 for instance.

00:54.280 --> 00:59.560
It was the largest eruption on the North American continent in nearly a century, so large it

00:59.560 --> 01:04.920
blew away the top of the mountain and sent an ash column 12 miles high.

01:04.920 --> 01:09.440
And it pumped 10 million tonnes of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere.

01:09.440 --> 01:15.800
Surely that dwarfs the amount of CO2 produced by humans, you would have thought.

01:15.800 --> 01:18.360
In fact, it barely touched it.

01:18.360 --> 01:25.240
Natural fuel burning alone pumped out 19.5 billion tonnes of CO2 that same year, in other

01:25.240 --> 01:29.360
words 2,000 times as much as Mount St Helens.

01:29.360 --> 01:34.720
As for 40 undersea volcanoes emitting more CO2 than humans ever have in the space of

01:34.720 --> 01:39.600
just a couple of months, again all you have to do is check the figures.

01:39.600 --> 01:46.560
That would be over 400 billion tonnes of CO2, over 6 billion tonnes a day, and that amount

01:46.560 --> 01:52.200
of CO2 bubbling out of the water around Antarctica would have been noticed not just by us using

01:52.200 --> 01:56.880
instruments but by the penguins who would have suffocated from it.

01:56.880 --> 02:01.880
As made up stories go, this one really hasn't been thought through.

02:01.880 --> 02:07.560
As I showed in this video, one reason we definitively know the CO2 comes from burning fossil fuels

02:07.560 --> 02:13.880
is because it bears an isotopic signature that relates to oil and coal, not volcanoes,

02:13.880 --> 02:17.240
so watch that video to find out why.

02:17.240 --> 02:21.880
The information on how much CO2 volcanoes emit can be found with a simple click of a

02:21.880 --> 02:26.600
mouse button on the United States Geological Survey website.

02:26.600 --> 02:31.500
They're the people who measure and record worldwide volcanic activity.

02:31.500 --> 02:36.880
So the intriguing question is, if these numbers are so easy to check, why do people still

02:36.880 --> 02:41.160
believe this myth, and who started it?

02:41.160 --> 02:46.240
I tracked it back to a book written by this man, Ian Plimer.

02:46.240 --> 02:51.280
Ian Rutherford Plimer is an Australian geologist, explains this poster on Facebook, who tells

02:51.280 --> 02:56.240
us he's going to reveal some very interesting information on climate change that may shock

02:56.240 --> 02:58.360
many of you.

02:58.360 --> 03:02.880
Plimer's information on climate change doesn't come from a scientific study.

03:02.880 --> 03:07.360
He hasn't measured and re-evaluated the CO2 output of volcanoes.

03:07.360 --> 03:09.840
He isn't even a volcanologist.

03:09.840 --> 03:15.000
He simply makes two pronouncements in his book without giving any figures or citing

03:15.000 --> 03:20.080
sources, and then people unquestioningly believe it.

03:20.080 --> 03:24.720
Volcanoes produce more CO2 than the world's cars and industries combine.

03:24.720 --> 03:29.620
Volcanoes add far more CO2 to the oceans and atmosphere than humans.

03:29.620 --> 03:31.440
And that's it.

03:31.440 --> 03:33.360
That's the great thing about books.

03:33.360 --> 03:37.620
Books can make any claim the author wants without having to give a source or even give

03:37.620 --> 03:39.240
any figures.

03:39.240 --> 03:44.480
Even a lot of people who are not the least bit skeptical of unsourced unquantified claims

03:44.480 --> 03:46.960
are willing to believe it.

03:46.960 --> 03:51.680
It's interesting that when Plimer gives information in his book that's based on published scientific

03:51.680 --> 03:57.840
research, like the amount of CO2 absorbed by the oceans, he readily gives his source.

03:57.840 --> 04:02.920
Where he throws in something he's made up or believes or incorrectly remembered and

04:02.920 --> 04:06.720
not bothered to check, there's no source.

04:06.720 --> 04:11.440
And Plimer could quite easily go on the internet and get the actual figures from the United

04:11.440 --> 04:13.920
States Geological Survey.

04:13.920 --> 04:18.280
In fact, Plimer's pronouncements have become so widely believed on the internet that the

04:18.280 --> 04:22.480
USGS even created a page with that very question.

04:22.480 --> 04:28.440
Do the Earth's volcanoes emit more CO2 than human activities, it asks.

04:28.440 --> 04:32.260
And the answer it gives is no.

04:32.260 --> 04:37.180
And unlike Plimer's proclamation, this is based on actual measurements published in

04:37.180 --> 04:41.180
scientific journals that can be checked.

04:41.180 --> 04:46.260
Plimer is a familiar face on TV chat shows and climate conferences, and a lot of people

04:46.260 --> 04:51.860
swallow whatever he says because his qualifications seem so impressive.

04:51.860 --> 04:56.080
Professor Emeritus of Earth Sciences at the University of Melbourne, Professor of Mining

04:56.080 --> 05:00.980
Geology at the University of Adelaide, and the Director of Multiple Mineral Exploration

05:00.980 --> 05:06.740
and Mining Companies, he's published 130 scientific papers, six books, and edited the

05:06.740 --> 05:09.060
Encyclopedia of Geology.

05:09.060 --> 05:12.420
Sounds pretty learned stroke credible, don't you think?

05:12.420 --> 05:19.300
Well, yes, in his field, which is mining engineering, the subject he was writing about in those

05:19.300 --> 05:20.360
papers.

05:20.360 --> 05:25.740
But he's never published a single scientific paper on volcanology or paleoclimatology or

05:25.740 --> 05:27.740
glaciology.

05:27.740 --> 05:33.020
In those subjects which he pronounces on, Ian Plimer is clearly out of his depth.

05:33.020 --> 05:41.220
We've had six major ice ages, and every single major ice age started when we had more carbon

05:41.220 --> 05:43.260
dioxide in the atmosphere than now.

05:43.260 --> 05:47.300
Well, I don't want to quibble, but let's just correct this for the record.

05:47.300 --> 05:52.380
Two of those ice ages occurred in what's called the Precambrian, when the makeup of the atmosphere

05:52.380 --> 05:54.860
isn't very well understood.

05:54.860 --> 05:57.660
Very few rocks survive from that period.

05:57.660 --> 06:02.680
So Plimer can't say that CO2 levels were higher, we simply don't know.

06:02.680 --> 06:07.020
Nearly all of our geological knowledge comes from the Phanerozoic, which started with the

06:07.020 --> 06:10.740
Cambrian about 550 million years ago.

06:10.740 --> 06:15.240
It takes us from a time when there was no life at all on land, and continues all the

06:15.240 --> 06:21.140
way through the era of the amphibians, giant dragonflies, and through the age of the dinosaurs

06:21.140 --> 06:22.940
to now.

06:22.940 --> 06:29.180
And of the three ice ages during the Phanerozoic, only the late Ordovician had higher CO2 levels

06:29.180 --> 06:30.980
than today.

06:30.980 --> 06:36.180
But with that correction in mind, it's true to say there was indeed one ice age during

06:36.180 --> 06:41.280
the late Ordovician when CO2 levels were much higher than today.

06:41.280 --> 06:46.900
But this is already well known by paleoclimatologists, because they're the people that did the research

06:46.900 --> 06:52.660
and published this information, which is how it got it to geology textbooks and then disseminated

06:52.700 --> 06:56.020
on the internet, which is how Plimer learned about it.

06:56.020 --> 07:01.140
In times gone by when the carbon dioxide content was 100 times the current content, we didn't

07:01.140 --> 07:04.100
have runaway global warming, we actually had glaciation.

07:04.100 --> 07:08.960
He didn't discover this himself, he didn't even learn it as an undergraduate, it's just

07:08.960 --> 07:12.740
public information that's even published on Wikipedia.

07:12.740 --> 07:15.980
So what exactly is Plimer's point?

07:15.980 --> 07:18.500
Well that's the thing, he doesn't make a point.

07:18.500 --> 07:23.700
I think he expects us to conclude that if CO2 was higher at a time when there was an

07:23.700 --> 07:29.340
ice age, then higher levels of CO2 can't possibly cause global warming.

07:29.340 --> 07:35.300
And that would be a fair enough conclusion, based on the minimal information he's given us.

07:35.300 --> 07:40.060
If I told you that my car went from New York to New Orleans on just one tank of gas, you

07:40.060 --> 07:43.440
might conclude it was incredibly fuel efficient.

07:43.440 --> 07:49.920
And that would be a reasonable conclusion, because I hadn't told you the whole story.

07:49.920 --> 07:52.040
Remember pothole as axiom.

07:52.040 --> 07:57.080
If you think you figured out something based on widely available information, and it contradicts

07:57.080 --> 08:02.680
what researchers have concluded, then there are only three possible explanations.

08:02.680 --> 08:08.120
Either researchers are all incompetent, or they're all dishonest, or they know something

08:08.120 --> 08:09.960
you don't.

08:09.960 --> 08:14.080
And I'd encourage everyone to explore the third option first.

08:14.080 --> 08:19.320
So is it possible that real experts in this field know something that Plimer doesn't?

08:19.320 --> 08:24.720
Okay, I'm sure you know where this is going, because I've covered this shopworn myth before.

08:24.720 --> 08:29.520
What Plimer's not telling you is that all those past ice ages occurred when the sun

08:29.520 --> 08:32.120
was much weaker than today.

08:32.120 --> 08:36.880
That didn't matter as long as there were high enough levels of CO2 to keep the earth warm.

08:36.880 --> 08:42.940
But when the CO2 concentration dropped, temperatures fell, triggering an ice age.

08:42.940 --> 08:48.000
Now please don't tell me that temperature dropped first and then CO2 levels.

08:48.000 --> 08:53.600
You're confusing phanerozoic ice ages with Pleistocene glacial cycles.

08:53.600 --> 08:58.360
I've done a whole video on that and also explained these different time periods in my video The

08:58.360 --> 09:01.840
Story of the Earth in 33 Minutes.

09:01.840 --> 09:06.280
So is Ian Plimer failing to give you that crucial information because he doesn't know

09:06.280 --> 09:07.280
it?

09:07.280 --> 09:10.960
After all, he's never studied the subject, because when he was an undergraduate in the

09:10.960 --> 09:16.440
1960s the role of the sun and carbon dioxide during the phanerozoic and the cause of ice

09:16.440 --> 09:19.740
ages weren't well understood.

09:19.740 --> 09:23.120
Or is he failing to give you that crucial information because he's trying to pull

09:23.120 --> 09:25.520
the wool over your eyes?

09:25.520 --> 09:29.680
That's not for me to speculate, but it has to be one or the other.

09:29.680 --> 09:33.720
Finally, there's this astonishing claim.

09:33.720 --> 09:38.280
Trying to argue that carbon gases shouldn't be treated as pollutants, Plimer said this,

09:38.280 --> 09:40.520
There are no carbon emissions.

09:40.520 --> 09:46.100
If there were, we could not see, because most carbon is black.

09:46.100 --> 09:50.700
If anyone thinks the Professor of Mining Engineering makes a good point, I'll have to explain

09:50.700 --> 09:56.340
that the term carbon emissions refers to gases that contain carbon.

09:56.340 --> 10:01.500
The two that are most relevant to global warming are methane and carbon dioxide.

10:01.500 --> 10:06.500
But surely, as Plimer points out, if there were such a thing as carbon emissions, these

10:06.500 --> 10:09.700
gases would be black, because carbon is black.

10:09.700 --> 10:15.700
Well, firstly, no, only carbon in the form of graphite or amorphous carbon is black.

10:15.700 --> 10:18.360
In the form of diamond, it's colourless.

10:18.360 --> 10:22.620
In the form of fullerenes, it comes in a variety of colours depending on the length of the

10:22.620 --> 10:24.580
carbon chain.

10:24.580 --> 10:27.080
Carbon atoms themselves have no colour.

10:27.080 --> 10:31.260
The colour depends on how the carbon atoms are arranged.

10:31.260 --> 10:36.180
Secondly, when carbon combines with other elements, called carbon compounds, they produce

10:36.180 --> 10:37.860
a range of colours.

10:37.860 --> 10:39.860
Calcium carbonate is white.

10:39.860 --> 10:42.360
Copper carbonate is green.

10:42.360 --> 10:45.620
Methane and carbon dioxide are colourless.

10:45.620 --> 10:51.340
So the idea that carbon is black is wrong, and even if it was, the idea that carbon compounds

10:51.340 --> 10:56.700
therefore have to be black is equally wrong, and the idea that there are no carbon emissions

10:56.700 --> 11:02.600
because otherwise the atmosphere would be black is complete nonsense.

11:02.600 --> 11:06.460
Now again, I'm not suggesting Ian Plimer doesn't know this.

11:06.460 --> 11:11.820
After all, most of us learned this in elementary school, and as an experienced mining engineer,

11:11.820 --> 11:17.140
Plimer will be very familiar with carbon compounds that come in a lot of different colours.

11:17.140 --> 11:21.720
But here again is the conundrum, not just with Plimer, but with all these pundits from

11:21.720 --> 11:24.560
William Happer to Patrick Moore.

11:24.560 --> 11:29.720
If Plimer is making incorrect statements about simple facts, like the amount of CO2

11:29.720 --> 11:35.880
coming out of volcanoes or the colour of carbon compounds, then is he ignorant or is he deliberately

11:35.880 --> 11:38.520
trying to mislead people?

11:38.520 --> 11:43.560
And if it's the latter, what is he hoped to gain by selling misleading books to a huge

11:43.560 --> 11:50.260
market of credulous readers at $21.34 a copy on Kindle?

11:50.260 --> 11:54.640
And why do people believe him when the figures clearly contradict him?

11:54.640 --> 11:59.920
I'm happy to admit that I came bottom of my class at school, and I'm nowhere near clever

11:59.920 --> 12:05.240
enough to be a university professor or write a scientific paper.

12:05.240 --> 12:06.960
But that's the point.

12:06.960 --> 12:12.520
If a dope like me can find information just by checking publicly available sources, then

12:12.520 --> 12:20.080
why can't these professors and learned-stroke-credible pundits who claim to be experts do it too?

12:20.100 --> 12:24.060
receiving pronouncements from people with titles who don't measure things and don't

12:24.060 --> 12:29.660
give figures is taking us back to the 13th century, a time when people assumed that women

12:29.660 --> 12:34.820
had fewer teeth than men, simply because Aristotle said so.

12:34.820 --> 12:40.980
Bizarre as it may seem, no one thought to actually count the number of teeth and check.

12:40.980 --> 12:45.360
And that's the difference today between the blogosphere, which disseminates proclamations

12:45.360 --> 12:51.560
handed down from learned-stroke-credible people, and science, which is based on measuring

12:51.560 --> 12:53.600
and checking.

12:53.600 --> 12:58.060
Science is about counting the number of teeth, not believing whatever some bloke believes

12:58.060 --> 13:02.580
at the number of teeth, because that's what some other bloke told him.

13:02.580 --> 13:05.940
Finally, my apologies for the long delay in posting.

13:05.940 --> 13:10.220
I've been very busy since the end of the pandemic, and I was working on a video about

13:10.220 --> 13:13.020
mountain building in between assignments.

13:13.020 --> 13:16.280
Then I had a computer crash and everything was lost.

13:16.280 --> 13:20.320
The backup is in Australia, and right now I'm in Europe.

13:20.320 --> 13:23.100
I'll get back to that one in October.

13:23.100 --> 13:28.080
So instead I started work on this video, which has taken longer than expected.

13:28.080 --> 13:33.020
So yes, I'm still very much alive, but please expect another delay until I get back to Australia

13:33.020 --> 13:34.260
in October.

13:34.260 --> 13:39.960
I'm also working on a series, By Popular Demand, explaining how to sort fact from fiction on

13:39.960 --> 13:43.380
the internet, aimed especially at millennials.

13:43.380 --> 13:48.940
Don't forget that my videos aren't supported by advertising, I don't ask for contributions.

13:48.940 --> 13:52.460
My reward comes by donations to a charity.

13:52.460 --> 13:57.540
You'll find a link in the video description, and I'm always kept informed of how well donations

13:57.540 --> 13:59.540
are doing on my behalf.

13:59.540 --> 14:04.020
Last time I checked, it was over 200,000 US dollars.

14:04.020 --> 14:09.040
My thanks to all those who've given, and I do know I need to fulfil my obligation, my

14:09.040 --> 14:12.460
side of the bargain, which is to make more videos.

14:12.460 --> 14:16.580
I promise I've got two assignments left in the Far East, I'll be back home by the end

14:16.580 --> 14:19.020
of October, and I will get stuck in.

14:19.020 --> 14:19.860
Thanks.
