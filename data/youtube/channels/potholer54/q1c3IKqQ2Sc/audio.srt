1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,560
I'm still getting lots of posts from people who think volcanoes emit more CO2 than humans.

2
00:00:06,560 --> 00:00:12,120
Even after I busted this popular myth in my video, are humans contributing only 3% of

3
00:00:12,120 --> 00:00:14,580
CO2 in the atmosphere?

4
00:00:14,580 --> 00:00:19,840
So in this video I'll track down the man who started the myth, and at the end I'll explain

5
00:00:19,840 --> 00:00:23,400
why there's been such a long gap since my last video.

6
00:00:23,400 --> 00:00:25,680
Thanks for your patience.

7
00:00:25,680 --> 00:00:30,880
Let's start with this poster who claims that 40 volcanoes have been erupting under Antarctica

8
00:00:30,880 --> 00:00:36,520
and emitted more CO2 than humans ever have in just two months.

9
00:00:36,520 --> 00:00:42,640
And another, more vague claim that anthropogenic climate change is a boogeyman because, well,

10
00:00:42,640 --> 00:00:47,600
just look at the amount of CO2 produced by just one volcanic eruption.

11
00:00:47,600 --> 00:00:50,520
Which is fair enough, let's look.

12
00:00:50,520 --> 00:00:54,280
Take the eruption of Mount St Helens in 1980 for instance.

13
00:00:54,280 --> 00:00:59,560
It was the largest eruption on the North American continent in nearly a century, so large it

14
00:00:59,560 --> 00:01:04,920
blew away the top of the mountain and sent an ash column 12 miles high.

15
00:01:04,920 --> 00:01:09,440
And it pumped 10 million tonnes of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere.

16
00:01:09,440 --> 00:01:15,800
Surely that dwarfs the amount of CO2 produced by humans, you would have thought.

17
00:01:15,800 --> 00:01:18,360
In fact, it barely touched it.

18
00:01:18,360 --> 00:01:25,240
Natural fuel burning alone pumped out 19.5 billion tonnes of CO2 that same year, in other

19
00:01:25,240 --> 00:01:29,360
words 2,000 times as much as Mount St Helens.

20
00:01:29,360 --> 00:01:34,720
As for 40 undersea volcanoes emitting more CO2 than humans ever have in the space of

21
00:01:34,720 --> 00:01:39,600
just a couple of months, again all you have to do is check the figures.

22
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:46,560
That would be over 400 billion tonnes of CO2, over 6 billion tonnes a day, and that amount

23
00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:52,200
of CO2 bubbling out of the water around Antarctica would have been noticed not just by us using

24
00:01:52,200 --> 00:01:56,880
instruments but by the penguins who would have suffocated from it.

25
00:01:56,880 --> 00:02:01,880
As made up stories go, this one really hasn't been thought through.

26
00:02:01,880 --> 00:02:07,560
As I showed in this video, one reason we definitively know the CO2 comes from burning fossil fuels

27
00:02:07,560 --> 00:02:13,880
is because it bears an isotopic signature that relates to oil and coal, not volcanoes,

28
00:02:13,880 --> 00:02:17,240
so watch that video to find out why.

29
00:02:17,240 --> 00:02:21,880
The information on how much CO2 volcanoes emit can be found with a simple click of a

30
00:02:21,880 --> 00:02:26,600
mouse button on the United States Geological Survey website.

31
00:02:26,600 --> 00:02:31,500
They're the people who measure and record worldwide volcanic activity.

32
00:02:31,500 --> 00:02:36,880
So the intriguing question is, if these numbers are so easy to check, why do people still

33
00:02:36,880 --> 00:02:41,160
believe this myth, and who started it?

34
00:02:41,160 --> 00:02:46,240
I tracked it back to a book written by this man, Ian Plimer.

35
00:02:46,240 --> 00:02:51,280
Ian Rutherford Plimer is an Australian geologist, explains this poster on Facebook, who tells

36
00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:56,240
us he's going to reveal some very interesting information on climate change that may shock

37
00:02:56,240 --> 00:02:58,360
many of you.

38
00:02:58,360 --> 00:03:02,880
Plimer's information on climate change doesn't come from a scientific study.

39
00:03:02,880 --> 00:03:07,360
He hasn't measured and re-evaluated the CO2 output of volcanoes.

40
00:03:07,360 --> 00:03:09,840
He isn't even a volcanologist.

41
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:15,000
He simply makes two pronouncements in his book without giving any figures or citing

42
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:20,080
sources, and then people unquestioningly believe it.

43
00:03:20,080 --> 00:03:24,720
Volcanoes produce more CO2 than the world's cars and industries combine.

44
00:03:24,720 --> 00:03:29,620
Volcanoes add far more CO2 to the oceans and atmosphere than humans.

45
00:03:29,620 --> 00:03:31,440
And that's it.

46
00:03:31,440 --> 00:03:33,360
That's the great thing about books.

47
00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:37,620
Books can make any claim the author wants without having to give a source or even give

48
00:03:37,620 --> 00:03:39,240
any figures.

49
00:03:39,240 --> 00:03:44,480
Even a lot of people who are not the least bit skeptical of unsourced unquantified claims

50
00:03:44,480 --> 00:03:46,960
are willing to believe it.

51
00:03:46,960 --> 00:03:51,680
It's interesting that when Plimer gives information in his book that's based on published scientific

52
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:57,840
research, like the amount of CO2 absorbed by the oceans, he readily gives his source.

53
00:03:57,840 --> 00:04:02,920
Where he throws in something he's made up or believes or incorrectly remembered and

54
00:04:02,920 --> 00:04:06,720
not bothered to check, there's no source.

55
00:04:06,720 --> 00:04:11,440
And Plimer could quite easily go on the internet and get the actual figures from the United

56
00:04:11,440 --> 00:04:13,920
States Geological Survey.

57
00:04:13,920 --> 00:04:18,280
In fact, Plimer's pronouncements have become so widely believed on the internet that the

58
00:04:18,280 --> 00:04:22,480
USGS even created a page with that very question.

59
00:04:22,480 --> 00:04:28,440
Do the Earth's volcanoes emit more CO2 than human activities, it asks.

60
00:04:28,440 --> 00:04:32,260
And the answer it gives is no.

61
00:04:32,260 --> 00:04:37,180
And unlike Plimer's proclamation, this is based on actual measurements published in

62
00:04:37,180 --> 00:04:41,180
scientific journals that can be checked.

63
00:04:41,180 --> 00:04:46,260
Plimer is a familiar face on TV chat shows and climate conferences, and a lot of people

64
00:04:46,260 --> 00:04:51,860
swallow whatever he says because his qualifications seem so impressive.

65
00:04:51,860 --> 00:04:56,080
Professor Emeritus of Earth Sciences at the University of Melbourne, Professor of Mining

66
00:04:56,080 --> 00:05:00,980
Geology at the University of Adelaide, and the Director of Multiple Mineral Exploration

67
00:05:00,980 --> 00:05:06,740
and Mining Companies, he's published 130 scientific papers, six books, and edited the

68
00:05:06,740 --> 00:05:09,060
Encyclopedia of Geology.

69
00:05:09,060 --> 00:05:12,420
Sounds pretty learned stroke credible, don't you think?

70
00:05:12,420 --> 00:05:19,300
Well, yes, in his field, which is mining engineering, the subject he was writing about in those

71
00:05:19,300 --> 00:05:20,360
papers.

72
00:05:20,360 --> 00:05:25,740
But he's never published a single scientific paper on volcanology or paleoclimatology or

73
00:05:25,740 --> 00:05:27,740
glaciology.

74
00:05:27,740 --> 00:05:33,020
In those subjects which he pronounces on, Ian Plimer is clearly out of his depth.

75
00:05:33,020 --> 00:05:41,220
We've had six major ice ages, and every single major ice age started when we had more carbon

76
00:05:41,220 --> 00:05:43,260
dioxide in the atmosphere than now.

77
00:05:43,260 --> 00:05:47,300
Well, I don't want to quibble, but let's just correct this for the record.

78
00:05:47,300 --> 00:05:52,380
Two of those ice ages occurred in what's called the Precambrian, when the makeup of the atmosphere

79
00:05:52,380 --> 00:05:54,860
isn't very well understood.

80
00:05:54,860 --> 00:05:57,660
Very few rocks survive from that period.

81
00:05:57,660 --> 00:06:02,680
So Plimer can't say that CO2 levels were higher, we simply don't know.

82
00:06:02,680 --> 00:06:07,020
Nearly all of our geological knowledge comes from the Phanerozoic, which started with the

83
00:06:07,020 --> 00:06:10,740
Cambrian about 550 million years ago.

84
00:06:10,740 --> 00:06:15,240
It takes us from a time when there was no life at all on land, and continues all the

85
00:06:15,240 --> 00:06:21,140
way through the era of the amphibians, giant dragonflies, and through the age of the dinosaurs

86
00:06:21,140 --> 00:06:22,940
to now.

87
00:06:22,940 --> 00:06:29,180
And of the three ice ages during the Phanerozoic, only the late Ordovician had higher CO2 levels

88
00:06:29,180 --> 00:06:30,980
than today.

89
00:06:30,980 --> 00:06:36,180
But with that correction in mind, it's true to say there was indeed one ice age during

90
00:06:36,180 --> 00:06:41,280
the late Ordovician when CO2 levels were much higher than today.

91
00:06:41,280 --> 00:06:46,900
But this is already well known by paleoclimatologists, because they're the people that did the research

92
00:06:46,900 --> 00:06:52,660
and published this information, which is how it got it to geology textbooks and then disseminated

93
00:06:52,700 --> 00:06:56,020
on the internet, which is how Plimer learned about it.

94
00:06:56,020 --> 00:07:01,140
In times gone by when the carbon dioxide content was 100 times the current content, we didn't

95
00:07:01,140 --> 00:07:04,100
have runaway global warming, we actually had glaciation.

96
00:07:04,100 --> 00:07:08,960
He didn't discover this himself, he didn't even learn it as an undergraduate, it's just

97
00:07:08,960 --> 00:07:12,740
public information that's even published on Wikipedia.

98
00:07:12,740 --> 00:07:15,980
So what exactly is Plimer's point?

99
00:07:15,980 --> 00:07:18,500
Well that's the thing, he doesn't make a point.

100
00:07:18,500 --> 00:07:23,700
I think he expects us to conclude that if CO2 was higher at a time when there was an

101
00:07:23,700 --> 00:07:29,340
ice age, then higher levels of CO2 can't possibly cause global warming.

102
00:07:29,340 --> 00:07:35,300
And that would be a fair enough conclusion, based on the minimal information he's given us.

103
00:07:35,300 --> 00:07:40,060
If I told you that my car went from New York to New Orleans on just one tank of gas, you

104
00:07:40,060 --> 00:07:43,440
might conclude it was incredibly fuel efficient.

105
00:07:43,440 --> 00:07:49,920
And that would be a reasonable conclusion, because I hadn't told you the whole story.

106
00:07:49,920 --> 00:07:52,040
Remember pothole as axiom.

107
00:07:52,040 --> 00:07:57,080
If you think you figured out something based on widely available information, and it contradicts

108
00:07:57,080 --> 00:08:02,680
what researchers have concluded, then there are only three possible explanations.

109
00:08:02,680 --> 00:08:08,120
Either researchers are all incompetent, or they're all dishonest, or they know something

110
00:08:08,120 --> 00:08:09,960
you don't.

111
00:08:09,960 --> 00:08:14,080
And I'd encourage everyone to explore the third option first.

112
00:08:14,080 --> 00:08:19,320
So is it possible that real experts in this field know something that Plimer doesn't?

113
00:08:19,320 --> 00:08:24,720
Okay, I'm sure you know where this is going, because I've covered this shopworn myth before.

114
00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:29,520
What Plimer's not telling you is that all those past ice ages occurred when the sun

115
00:08:29,520 --> 00:08:32,120
was much weaker than today.

116
00:08:32,120 --> 00:08:36,880
That didn't matter as long as there were high enough levels of CO2 to keep the earth warm.

117
00:08:36,880 --> 00:08:42,940
But when the CO2 concentration dropped, temperatures fell, triggering an ice age.

118
00:08:42,940 --> 00:08:48,000
Now please don't tell me that temperature dropped first and then CO2 levels.

119
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:53,600
You're confusing phanerozoic ice ages with Pleistocene glacial cycles.

120
00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:58,360
I've done a whole video on that and also explained these different time periods in my video The

121
00:08:58,360 --> 00:09:01,840
Story of the Earth in 33 Minutes.

122
00:09:01,840 --> 00:09:06,280
So is Ian Plimer failing to give you that crucial information because he doesn't know

123
00:09:06,280 --> 00:09:07,280
it?

124
00:09:07,280 --> 00:09:10,960
After all, he's never studied the subject, because when he was an undergraduate in the

125
00:09:10,960 --> 00:09:16,440
1960s the role of the sun and carbon dioxide during the phanerozoic and the cause of ice

126
00:09:16,440 --> 00:09:19,740
ages weren't well understood.

127
00:09:19,740 --> 00:09:23,120
Or is he failing to give you that crucial information because he's trying to pull

128
00:09:23,120 --> 00:09:25,520
the wool over your eyes?

129
00:09:25,520 --> 00:09:29,680
That's not for me to speculate, but it has to be one or the other.

130
00:09:29,680 --> 00:09:33,720
Finally, there's this astonishing claim.

131
00:09:33,720 --> 00:09:38,280
Trying to argue that carbon gases shouldn't be treated as pollutants, Plimer said this,

132
00:09:38,280 --> 00:09:40,520
There are no carbon emissions.

133
00:09:40,520 --> 00:09:46,100
If there were, we could not see, because most carbon is black.

134
00:09:46,100 --> 00:09:50,700
If anyone thinks the Professor of Mining Engineering makes a good point, I'll have to explain

135
00:09:50,700 --> 00:09:56,340
that the term carbon emissions refers to gases that contain carbon.

136
00:09:56,340 --> 00:10:01,500
The two that are most relevant to global warming are methane and carbon dioxide.

137
00:10:01,500 --> 00:10:06,500
But surely, as Plimer points out, if there were such a thing as carbon emissions, these

138
00:10:06,500 --> 00:10:09,700
gases would be black, because carbon is black.

139
00:10:09,700 --> 00:10:15,700
Well, firstly, no, only carbon in the form of graphite or amorphous carbon is black.

140
00:10:15,700 --> 00:10:18,360
In the form of diamond, it's colourless.

141
00:10:18,360 --> 00:10:22,620
In the form of fullerenes, it comes in a variety of colours depending on the length of the

142
00:10:22,620 --> 00:10:24,580
carbon chain.

143
00:10:24,580 --> 00:10:27,080
Carbon atoms themselves have no colour.

144
00:10:27,080 --> 00:10:31,260
The colour depends on how the carbon atoms are arranged.

145
00:10:31,260 --> 00:10:36,180
Secondly, when carbon combines with other elements, called carbon compounds, they produce

146
00:10:36,180 --> 00:10:37,860
a range of colours.

147
00:10:37,860 --> 00:10:39,860
Calcium carbonate is white.

148
00:10:39,860 --> 00:10:42,360
Copper carbonate is green.

149
00:10:42,360 --> 00:10:45,620
Methane and carbon dioxide are colourless.

150
00:10:45,620 --> 00:10:51,340
So the idea that carbon is black is wrong, and even if it was, the idea that carbon compounds

151
00:10:51,340 --> 00:10:56,700
therefore have to be black is equally wrong, and the idea that there are no carbon emissions

152
00:10:56,700 --> 00:11:02,600
because otherwise the atmosphere would be black is complete nonsense.

153
00:11:02,600 --> 00:11:06,460
Now again, I'm not suggesting Ian Plimer doesn't know this.

154
00:11:06,460 --> 00:11:11,820
After all, most of us learned this in elementary school, and as an experienced mining engineer,

155
00:11:11,820 --> 00:11:17,140
Plimer will be very familiar with carbon compounds that come in a lot of different colours.

156
00:11:17,140 --> 00:11:21,720
But here again is the conundrum, not just with Plimer, but with all these pundits from

157
00:11:21,720 --> 00:11:24,560
William Happer to Patrick Moore.

158
00:11:24,560 --> 00:11:29,720
If Plimer is making incorrect statements about simple facts, like the amount of CO2

159
00:11:29,720 --> 00:11:35,880
coming out of volcanoes or the colour of carbon compounds, then is he ignorant or is he deliberately

160
00:11:35,880 --> 00:11:38,520
trying to mislead people?

161
00:11:38,520 --> 00:11:43,560
And if it's the latter, what is he hoped to gain by selling misleading books to a huge

162
00:11:43,560 --> 00:11:50,260
market of credulous readers at $21.34 a copy on Kindle?

163
00:11:50,260 --> 00:11:54,640
And why do people believe him when the figures clearly contradict him?

164
00:11:54,640 --> 00:11:59,920
I'm happy to admit that I came bottom of my class at school, and I'm nowhere near clever

165
00:11:59,920 --> 00:12:05,240
enough to be a university professor or write a scientific paper.

166
00:12:05,240 --> 00:12:06,960
But that's the point.

167
00:12:06,960 --> 00:12:12,520
If a dope like me can find information just by checking publicly available sources, then

168
00:12:12,520 --> 00:12:20,080
why can't these professors and learned-stroke-credible pundits who claim to be experts do it too?

169
00:12:20,100 --> 00:12:24,060
receiving pronouncements from people with titles who don't measure things and don't

170
00:12:24,060 --> 00:12:29,660
give figures is taking us back to the 13th century, a time when people assumed that women

171
00:12:29,660 --> 00:12:34,820
had fewer teeth than men, simply because Aristotle said so.

172
00:12:34,820 --> 00:12:40,980
Bizarre as it may seem, no one thought to actually count the number of teeth and check.

173
00:12:40,980 --> 00:12:45,360
And that's the difference today between the blogosphere, which disseminates proclamations

174
00:12:45,360 --> 00:12:51,560
handed down from learned-stroke-credible people, and science, which is based on measuring

175
00:12:51,560 --> 00:12:53,600
and checking.

176
00:12:53,600 --> 00:12:58,060
Science is about counting the number of teeth, not believing whatever some bloke believes

177
00:12:58,060 --> 00:13:02,580
at the number of teeth, because that's what some other bloke told him.

178
00:13:02,580 --> 00:13:05,940
Finally, my apologies for the long delay in posting.

179
00:13:05,940 --> 00:13:10,220
I've been very busy since the end of the pandemic, and I was working on a video about

180
00:13:10,220 --> 00:13:13,020
mountain building in between assignments.

181
00:13:13,020 --> 00:13:16,280
Then I had a computer crash and everything was lost.

182
00:13:16,280 --> 00:13:20,320
The backup is in Australia, and right now I'm in Europe.

183
00:13:20,320 --> 00:13:23,100
I'll get back to that one in October.

184
00:13:23,100 --> 00:13:28,080
So instead I started work on this video, which has taken longer than expected.

185
00:13:28,080 --> 00:13:33,020
So yes, I'm still very much alive, but please expect another delay until I get back to Australia

186
00:13:33,020 --> 00:13:34,260
in October.

187
00:13:34,260 --> 00:13:39,960
I'm also working on a series, By Popular Demand, explaining how to sort fact from fiction on

188
00:13:39,960 --> 00:13:43,380
the internet, aimed especially at millennials.

189
00:13:43,380 --> 00:13:48,940
Don't forget that my videos aren't supported by advertising, I don't ask for contributions.

190
00:13:48,940 --> 00:13:52,460
My reward comes by donations to a charity.

191
00:13:52,460 --> 00:13:57,540
You'll find a link in the video description, and I'm always kept informed of how well donations

192
00:13:57,540 --> 00:13:59,540
are doing on my behalf.

193
00:13:59,540 --> 00:14:04,020
Last time I checked, it was over 200,000 US dollars.

194
00:14:04,020 --> 00:14:09,040
My thanks to all those who've given, and I do know I need to fulfil my obligation, my

195
00:14:09,040 --> 00:14:12,460
side of the bargain, which is to make more videos.

196
00:14:12,460 --> 00:14:16,580
I promise I've got two assignments left in the Far East, I'll be back home by the end

197
00:14:16,580 --> 00:14:19,020
of October, and I will get stuck in.

198
00:14:19,020 --> 00:14:19,860
Thanks.
