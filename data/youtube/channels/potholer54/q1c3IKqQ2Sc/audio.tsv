0	6560	I'm still getting lots of posts from people who think volcanoes emit more CO2 than humans.
6560	12120	Even after I busted this popular myth in my video, are humans contributing only 3% of
12120	14580	CO2 in the atmosphere?
14580	19840	So in this video I'll track down the man who started the myth, and at the end I'll explain
19840	23400	why there's been such a long gap since my last video.
23400	25680	Thanks for your patience.
25680	30880	Let's start with this poster who claims that 40 volcanoes have been erupting under Antarctica
30880	36520	and emitted more CO2 than humans ever have in just two months.
36520	42640	And another, more vague claim that anthropogenic climate change is a boogeyman because, well,
42640	47600	just look at the amount of CO2 produced by just one volcanic eruption.
47600	50520	Which is fair enough, let's look.
50520	54280	Take the eruption of Mount St Helens in 1980 for instance.
54280	59560	It was the largest eruption on the North American continent in nearly a century, so large it
59560	64920	blew away the top of the mountain and sent an ash column 12 miles high.
64920	69440	And it pumped 10 million tonnes of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere.
69440	75800	Surely that dwarfs the amount of CO2 produced by humans, you would have thought.
75800	78360	In fact, it barely touched it.
78360	85240	Natural fuel burning alone pumped out 19.5 billion tonnes of CO2 that same year, in other
85240	89360	words 2,000 times as much as Mount St Helens.
89360	94720	As for 40 undersea volcanoes emitting more CO2 than humans ever have in the space of
94720	99600	just a couple of months, again all you have to do is check the figures.
99600	106560	That would be over 400 billion tonnes of CO2, over 6 billion tonnes a day, and that amount
106560	112200	of CO2 bubbling out of the water around Antarctica would have been noticed not just by us using
112200	116880	instruments but by the penguins who would have suffocated from it.
116880	121880	As made up stories go, this one really hasn't been thought through.
121880	127560	As I showed in this video, one reason we definitively know the CO2 comes from burning fossil fuels
127560	133880	is because it bears an isotopic signature that relates to oil and coal, not volcanoes,
133880	137240	so watch that video to find out why.
137240	141880	The information on how much CO2 volcanoes emit can be found with a simple click of a
141880	146600	mouse button on the United States Geological Survey website.
146600	151500	They're the people who measure and record worldwide volcanic activity.
151500	156880	So the intriguing question is, if these numbers are so easy to check, why do people still
156880	161160	believe this myth, and who started it?
161160	166240	I tracked it back to a book written by this man, Ian Plimer.
166240	171280	Ian Rutherford Plimer is an Australian geologist, explains this poster on Facebook, who tells
171280	176240	us he's going to reveal some very interesting information on climate change that may shock
176240	178360	many of you.
178360	182880	Plimer's information on climate change doesn't come from a scientific study.
182880	187360	He hasn't measured and re-evaluated the CO2 output of volcanoes.
187360	189840	He isn't even a volcanologist.
189840	195000	He simply makes two pronouncements in his book without giving any figures or citing
195000	200080	sources, and then people unquestioningly believe it.
200080	204720	Volcanoes produce more CO2 than the world's cars and industries combine.
204720	209620	Volcanoes add far more CO2 to the oceans and atmosphere than humans.
209620	211440	And that's it.
211440	213360	That's the great thing about books.
213360	217620	Books can make any claim the author wants without having to give a source or even give
217620	219240	any figures.
219240	224480	Even a lot of people who are not the least bit skeptical of unsourced unquantified claims
224480	226960	are willing to believe it.
226960	231680	It's interesting that when Plimer gives information in his book that's based on published scientific
231680	237840	research, like the amount of CO2 absorbed by the oceans, he readily gives his source.
237840	242920	Where he throws in something he's made up or believes or incorrectly remembered and
242920	246720	not bothered to check, there's no source.
246720	251440	And Plimer could quite easily go on the internet and get the actual figures from the United
251440	253920	States Geological Survey.
253920	258280	In fact, Plimer's pronouncements have become so widely believed on the internet that the
258280	262480	USGS even created a page with that very question.
262480	268440	Do the Earth's volcanoes emit more CO2 than human activities, it asks.
268440	272260	And the answer it gives is no.
272260	277180	And unlike Plimer's proclamation, this is based on actual measurements published in
277180	281180	scientific journals that can be checked.
281180	286260	Plimer is a familiar face on TV chat shows and climate conferences, and a lot of people
286260	291860	swallow whatever he says because his qualifications seem so impressive.
291860	296080	Professor Emeritus of Earth Sciences at the University of Melbourne, Professor of Mining
296080	300980	Geology at the University of Adelaide, and the Director of Multiple Mineral Exploration
300980	306740	and Mining Companies, he's published 130 scientific papers, six books, and edited the
306740	309060	Encyclopedia of Geology.
309060	312420	Sounds pretty learned stroke credible, don't you think?
312420	319300	Well, yes, in his field, which is mining engineering, the subject he was writing about in those
319300	320360	papers.
320360	325740	But he's never published a single scientific paper on volcanology or paleoclimatology or
325740	327740	glaciology.
327740	333020	In those subjects which he pronounces on, Ian Plimer is clearly out of his depth.
333020	341220	We've had six major ice ages, and every single major ice age started when we had more carbon
341220	343260	dioxide in the atmosphere than now.
343260	347300	Well, I don't want to quibble, but let's just correct this for the record.
347300	352380	Two of those ice ages occurred in what's called the Precambrian, when the makeup of the atmosphere
352380	354860	isn't very well understood.
354860	357660	Very few rocks survive from that period.
357660	362680	So Plimer can't say that CO2 levels were higher, we simply don't know.
362680	367020	Nearly all of our geological knowledge comes from the Phanerozoic, which started with the
367020	370740	Cambrian about 550 million years ago.
370740	375240	It takes us from a time when there was no life at all on land, and continues all the
375240	381140	way through the era of the amphibians, giant dragonflies, and through the age of the dinosaurs
381140	382940	to now.
382940	389180	And of the three ice ages during the Phanerozoic, only the late Ordovician had higher CO2 levels
389180	390980	than today.
390980	396180	But with that correction in mind, it's true to say there was indeed one ice age during
396180	401280	the late Ordovician when CO2 levels were much higher than today.
401280	406900	But this is already well known by paleoclimatologists, because they're the people that did the research
406900	412660	and published this information, which is how it got it to geology textbooks and then disseminated
412700	416020	on the internet, which is how Plimer learned about it.
416020	421140	In times gone by when the carbon dioxide content was 100 times the current content, we didn't
421140	424100	have runaway global warming, we actually had glaciation.
424100	428960	He didn't discover this himself, he didn't even learn it as an undergraduate, it's just
428960	432740	public information that's even published on Wikipedia.
432740	435980	So what exactly is Plimer's point?
435980	438500	Well that's the thing, he doesn't make a point.
438500	443700	I think he expects us to conclude that if CO2 was higher at a time when there was an
443700	449340	ice age, then higher levels of CO2 can't possibly cause global warming.
449340	455300	And that would be a fair enough conclusion, based on the minimal information he's given us.
455300	460060	If I told you that my car went from New York to New Orleans on just one tank of gas, you
460060	463440	might conclude it was incredibly fuel efficient.
463440	469920	And that would be a reasonable conclusion, because I hadn't told you the whole story.
469920	472040	Remember pothole as axiom.
472040	477080	If you think you figured out something based on widely available information, and it contradicts
477080	482680	what researchers have concluded, then there are only three possible explanations.
482680	488120	Either researchers are all incompetent, or they're all dishonest, or they know something
488120	489960	you don't.
489960	494080	And I'd encourage everyone to explore the third option first.
494080	499320	So is it possible that real experts in this field know something that Plimer doesn't?
499320	504720	Okay, I'm sure you know where this is going, because I've covered this shopworn myth before.
504720	509520	What Plimer's not telling you is that all those past ice ages occurred when the sun
509520	512120	was much weaker than today.
512120	516880	That didn't matter as long as there were high enough levels of CO2 to keep the earth warm.
516880	522940	But when the CO2 concentration dropped, temperatures fell, triggering an ice age.
522940	528000	Now please don't tell me that temperature dropped first and then CO2 levels.
528000	533600	You're confusing phanerozoic ice ages with Pleistocene glacial cycles.
533600	538360	I've done a whole video on that and also explained these different time periods in my video The
538360	541840	Story of the Earth in 33 Minutes.
541840	546280	So is Ian Plimer failing to give you that crucial information because he doesn't know
546280	547280	it?
547280	550960	After all, he's never studied the subject, because when he was an undergraduate in the
550960	556440	1960s the role of the sun and carbon dioxide during the phanerozoic and the cause of ice
556440	559740	ages weren't well understood.
559740	563120	Or is he failing to give you that crucial information because he's trying to pull
563120	565520	the wool over your eyes?
565520	569680	That's not for me to speculate, but it has to be one or the other.
569680	573720	Finally, there's this astonishing claim.
573720	578280	Trying to argue that carbon gases shouldn't be treated as pollutants, Plimer said this,
578280	580520	There are no carbon emissions.
580520	586100	If there were, we could not see, because most carbon is black.
586100	590700	If anyone thinks the Professor of Mining Engineering makes a good point, I'll have to explain
590700	596340	that the term carbon emissions refers to gases that contain carbon.
596340	601500	The two that are most relevant to global warming are methane and carbon dioxide.
601500	606500	But surely, as Plimer points out, if there were such a thing as carbon emissions, these
606500	609700	gases would be black, because carbon is black.
609700	615700	Well, firstly, no, only carbon in the form of graphite or amorphous carbon is black.
615700	618360	In the form of diamond, it's colourless.
618360	622620	In the form of fullerenes, it comes in a variety of colours depending on the length of the
622620	624580	carbon chain.
624580	627080	Carbon atoms themselves have no colour.
627080	631260	The colour depends on how the carbon atoms are arranged.
631260	636180	Secondly, when carbon combines with other elements, called carbon compounds, they produce
636180	637860	a range of colours.
637860	639860	Calcium carbonate is white.
639860	642360	Copper carbonate is green.
642360	645620	Methane and carbon dioxide are colourless.
645620	651340	So the idea that carbon is black is wrong, and even if it was, the idea that carbon compounds
651340	656700	therefore have to be black is equally wrong, and the idea that there are no carbon emissions
656700	662600	because otherwise the atmosphere would be black is complete nonsense.
662600	666460	Now again, I'm not suggesting Ian Plimer doesn't know this.
666460	671820	After all, most of us learned this in elementary school, and as an experienced mining engineer,
671820	677140	Plimer will be very familiar with carbon compounds that come in a lot of different colours.
677140	681720	But here again is the conundrum, not just with Plimer, but with all these pundits from
681720	684560	William Happer to Patrick Moore.
684560	689720	If Plimer is making incorrect statements about simple facts, like the amount of CO2
689720	695880	coming out of volcanoes or the colour of carbon compounds, then is he ignorant or is he deliberately
695880	698520	trying to mislead people?
698520	703560	And if it's the latter, what is he hoped to gain by selling misleading books to a huge
703560	710260	market of credulous readers at $21.34 a copy on Kindle?
710260	714640	And why do people believe him when the figures clearly contradict him?
714640	719920	I'm happy to admit that I came bottom of my class at school, and I'm nowhere near clever
719920	725240	enough to be a university professor or write a scientific paper.
725240	726960	But that's the point.
726960	732520	If a dope like me can find information just by checking publicly available sources, then
732520	740080	why can't these professors and learned-stroke-credible pundits who claim to be experts do it too?
740100	744060	receiving pronouncements from people with titles who don't measure things and don't
744060	749660	give figures is taking us back to the 13th century, a time when people assumed that women
749660	754820	had fewer teeth than men, simply because Aristotle said so.
754820	760980	Bizarre as it may seem, no one thought to actually count the number of teeth and check.
760980	765360	And that's the difference today between the blogosphere, which disseminates proclamations
765360	771560	handed down from learned-stroke-credible people, and science, which is based on measuring
771560	773600	and checking.
773600	778060	Science is about counting the number of teeth, not believing whatever some bloke believes
778060	782580	at the number of teeth, because that's what some other bloke told him.
782580	785940	Finally, my apologies for the long delay in posting.
785940	790220	I've been very busy since the end of the pandemic, and I was working on a video about
790220	793020	mountain building in between assignments.
793020	796280	Then I had a computer crash and everything was lost.
796280	800320	The backup is in Australia, and right now I'm in Europe.
800320	803100	I'll get back to that one in October.
803100	808080	So instead I started work on this video, which has taken longer than expected.
808080	813020	So yes, I'm still very much alive, but please expect another delay until I get back to Australia
813020	814260	in October.
814260	819960	I'm also working on a series, By Popular Demand, explaining how to sort fact from fiction on
819960	823380	the internet, aimed especially at millennials.
823380	828940	Don't forget that my videos aren't supported by advertising, I don't ask for contributions.
828940	832460	My reward comes by donations to a charity.
832460	837540	You'll find a link in the video description, and I'm always kept informed of how well donations
837540	839540	are doing on my behalf.
839540	844020	Last time I checked, it was over 200,000 US dollars.
844020	849040	My thanks to all those who've given, and I do know I need to fulfil my obligation, my
849040	852460	side of the bargain, which is to make more videos.
852460	856580	I promise I've got two assignments left in the Far East, I'll be back home by the end
856580	859020	of October, and I will get stuck in.
859020	859860	Thanks.
