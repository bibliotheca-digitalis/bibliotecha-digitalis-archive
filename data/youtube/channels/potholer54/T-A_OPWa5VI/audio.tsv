0	5920	My thanks to all those who suggested, or defiantly challenged me to debunk some supposedly higher
5920	10640	hanging fruit that you thought would be hard to debunk. I'll tackle those over the next
10640	15440	couple of videos. But I thought I'd start with this one because several people suggested
15440	22280	it and because the story is quite recent. The link led me to this blog.
22280	27200	Now this isn't something I'd normally cover because it hasn't got much science content,
27200	31960	but it is about scientists weaponising a virus and it's been widely reported and
31960	35600	believed so I'm happy to accept.
35600	41360	Debunking anything is a simple matter of finding the source in a series of steps. In this case
41360	47020	the first step is easy because the source is right there at the bottom of the page.
47020	54040	It links to this story by Rhea Matthews on news.com.au saying a leaked Chinese document
54040	60660	reveals a sinister plan to unleash coronavirus. And it quotes the Executive Director of the
60660	66880	Australian Strategic Policy Institute Peter Jennings as saying this is as close to a smoking
66880	73560	gun as we've got. It also says Robert Potter, a cyber security specialist who analyses leaked
73560	79320	Chinese government documents, was asked by the Australian to verify the paper. He says
79320	83000	the document definitely isn't fake.
83000	88840	News.com.au says it got all its information from the Australian newspaper because as luck
88840	96020	would have it both media outlets are run by News Corp, owned by my old boss Rupert Murdoch.
96020	101460	So both stories should have reported the same facts. You would have thought. But it turns
101460	107720	out they don't. I read the Australian story online so this is just a screenshot. The article
107720	113300	leads with this. The document, written by People's Liberation Army scientists and senior
113300	119440	Chinese public health officials in 2015, was obtained by the US State Department as it
119440	126800	conducted an investigation into the origins of Covid-19, the Weekend Australian has confirmed.
126800	131160	That certainly sounds secret, although the Australian doesn't actually say that the document
131160	138020	was secret. Then it changes from a document to a paper. The paper describes SARS coronaviruses
138020	144040	as heralding a new era of genetic weapons and says they can be artificially manipulated
144040	150000	into an emerging human disease virus, then weaponised and unleashed in a way never seen
150000	156580	before. The revelation? But hang on, is this really a revelation? After all, it's been
156580	161500	known for years that viruses can be engineered and weaponised. That's been the subject of
161500	168340	discussion by military analysts and intelligence organisations for decades, not just in China.
168340	174420	There's nothing in the Australian article to support news.com.au's assertion of an actual
174420	180940	plan to unleash coronaviruses. So where did the Australian get this from?
180940	187340	The Revelation features in an upcoming investigative book on the origins of Covid-19, titled What
187340	193940	Really Happened in Wuhan, to be published by HarperCollins. And as luck would have it,
193940	200100	the author of that book, Shari Markson, also works for News Corp. She not only writes for
200100	205540	the Australian, she's a commentator on News Corp's Sky News, where she first revealed
205540	208300	the contents of this leaked document.
208300	214480	New details from a document produced by Chinese military scientists, where they discuss weaponising
214480	220740	SARS coronaviruses five years before the pandemic hit. The book was written by…
220740	227420	Hang on, a book? This was a book? I thought this was… yeah, and not just any old Chinese
227420	232220	document, this was supposed to be a leaked Chinese document obtained by the US State
232220	239420	Department. But sure enough, I put a translated title into Wordsearch, and there it was. Not
239420	245560	only is this leaked document in fact a book, it was for sale on Amazon. Yeah, you could
245560	251220	once buy this book online, assuming you could afford it. The reason you can't do so now
251220	257980	is that it was published six years ago, so hardly a revelation.
258340	262860	Even if it's a six year old book, that doesn't change the fact that it reveals China's
262860	268260	sinister plan to unleash coronaviruses on the world. But this is the first thing that
268260	274640	struck me as odd. Why would the Chinese government hatch a sinister plan to bioengineer a deadly
274640	280620	virus in order to unleash it on the world, and then reveal the plan in a book and sell
280620	287740	it on Amazon? Sorry, just leaving you with that thought for a second.
287740	293220	Secondly, since the book would have been purchased and avidly read by intelligence agencies around
293220	298980	the world six years ago when it was published, how come they didn't see this as a sinister
298980	306100	plan to unleash a deadly virus on the world, or warn against it, or publicly condemn it?
306100	310140	No one writing about this has actually read the book, they're all relying on the information
310180	316460	about the contents from just one source, a commentator on Sky News. But in fact, she
316460	321940	doesn't say the book reveals a sinister plan to unleash coronaviruses at all. She
321940	326460	only says that the scientists discussed weaponising SARS coronaviruses.
326460	333020	It describes SARS coronaviruses as heralding, and I quote, a new era of genetic weapons.
333020	340100	It says they can be artificially manipulated into an emerging human disease virus, weaponised
340620	344780	and unleashed in a way never seen before.
344780	347620	And here are two more quotes that are interesting.
347620	352980	Biological weapons attacks could cause catastrophic harm. They could inflict widespread injury
352980	359820	and result in massive casualties and economic disruption. China possesses formidable capabilities.
359820	362980	That's pretty damning evidence.
362980	367980	In fact, this quote doesn't actually come from the book. It's from a publicly obtainable
368020	373980	document published by the White House in 2004. All I've done is substitute the word China
373980	379660	instead of the United States. If we see the quotes in context, you can see they have a
379660	384660	completely different meaning. The reason they have these discussions and do a lot of research
384660	390580	in this area is because the possibility of a viral attack is of great concern.
390580	397580	The significance of this paper is that it offers a rare insight into how senior scientists
397580	403460	at one of the PLA's most prominent military universities, where high levels of defence
403460	407660	research are conducted, were thinking about biological research.
407660	412460	But I thought the most significant thing in this book was supposed to be that it reveals
412460	419380	a sinister Chinese plan to unleash coronaviruses on the world. To uncover this sinister plan,
419380	424620	we need to see exactly what the discussion entailed. I can't get hold of a copy of the
424620	429620	book, of course, it's out of print, so I first checked a description of the book by the two
429620	436620	authors on the Amazon website. And yes indeed, they are discussing the weaponisation of SARS
436620	442820	virus, because they see it as a threat. Their conclusion is that another country may have
442820	447460	created the SARS virus and unleashed it on China.
447460	452480	I also found an extensive review of the book by a reader, written long before the Sky News
452480	458760	story went to air, and he relays the same conclusion. This book suspects that the SARS
458760	465660	virus was actually produced by a foreign laboratory. Further into her programme, Markson also says
465660	467560	that's the book's conclusion.
467560	474360	They claim, and it's a conspiracy theory, that the first SARS from 2003 was a man-made
474360	480680	bioweapon deliberately unleashed on China by terrorists. Of course, scientific consensus
480680	486320	holds that SARS was of natural origin and that it crossed the xenographic barrier from
486320	492120	palm civets to humans, likely through the sale of wild animals in wet markets. So this
492120	497840	is a very odd conspiracy theory for a senior Chinese military scientist to be pushing about
497840	506160	the SARS pandemic of 2003. And it's very similar to China now claiming that the COVID-19 pandemic
506160	510800	was brought into Wuhan in frozen food or by the American military.
510800	516640	Yes, I feel your pain, Shari. The book is nothing more than a conspiracy theory that
516640	522420	foreign enemies, and Taiwan was specifically mentioned, engineered SARS and launched it
522420	528880	against China. Now it's clear why the People's Liberation Army wanted this book to be published
528880	533480	and sold around the world. If you believe what this book says, then you've got an
533480	539480	awful lot of faith in what the Chinese government says and in unsubstantiated conspiracy theories
539480	545600	coming out of Beijing. So despite the rather dramatic innuendo in Marksman's opening,
545600	551560	she never said China had a plan to unleash coronaviruses. That part was invented later
551560	557320	along the information trail, which now looks like this. A publicly available book that
557320	562360	looks at the possibility that a foreign country had weaponised SARS and launched it against
562360	569020	China becomes a book discussing weaponising SARS, and that becomes a document obtained
569020	575880	by the US State Department discussing weaponising SARS, and that becomes a leaked document revealing
575880	584100	a sinister plan to unleash coronaviruses. So where in this chain of shame did the information
584100	590460	get changed? Well, Shari Marksman's account of the book is largely accurate and supported
590460	596060	by the authors themselves and by a reader. But she used disembodied quotes to make it
596060	601820	sound as though this had something to do with the current SARS-CoV-2 pandemic without offering
601820	607580	a shred of evidence that it did. The Australian hyped that further and made it sound as though
607580	613700	this was some kind of a secret document. But the real break comes when news.com.au gets
613700	620140	hold of the story and replaces the word book with leaked document and substitutes a discussion
620140	627460	about the weaponisation of SARS with a sinister Chinese plan to weaponise SARS, and that gets
627460	633020	copied and passed round the world. Of course, we had broken the big breaking news about
633020	642480	how the Chinese military had of course planned a biological warfare using the Covid-19 virus.
642480	647660	As you can see on your screens, the article written by an Australian publication, which
647660	653540	says that the Chinese scientists and the People Liberation Army in fact put their heads
653540	659260	together and came out with a document and wrote about how they were going to use the
659260	664620	SARS virus against the world. This kind of misinformation is exactly the
664620	669680	kind of thing you see in China all the time. News outlets that are ordered to follow a
669680	676180	particular line and facts that are ignored or invented in order to push that line. Do
676180	682860	we really want to see Western media descend to the same level of manipulation and propaganda?
682860	685420	Too late, but I think we can do better.
