00:00.000 --> 00:05.920
My thanks to all those who suggested, or defiantly challenged me to debunk some supposedly higher

00:05.920 --> 00:10.640
hanging fruit that you thought would be hard to debunk. I'll tackle those over the next

00:10.640 --> 00:15.440
couple of videos. But I thought I'd start with this one because several people suggested

00:15.440 --> 00:22.280
it and because the story is quite recent. The link led me to this blog.

00:22.280 --> 00:27.200
Now this isn't something I'd normally cover because it hasn't got much science content,

00:27.200 --> 00:31.960
but it is about scientists weaponising a virus and it's been widely reported and

00:31.960 --> 00:35.600
believed so I'm happy to accept.

00:35.600 --> 00:41.360
Debunking anything is a simple matter of finding the source in a series of steps. In this case

00:41.360 --> 00:47.020
the first step is easy because the source is right there at the bottom of the page.

00:47.020 --> 00:54.040
It links to this story by Rhea Matthews on news.com.au saying a leaked Chinese document

00:54.040 --> 01:00.660
reveals a sinister plan to unleash coronavirus. And it quotes the Executive Director of the

01:00.660 --> 01:06.880
Australian Strategic Policy Institute Peter Jennings as saying this is as close to a smoking

01:06.880 --> 01:13.560
gun as we've got. It also says Robert Potter, a cyber security specialist who analyses leaked

01:13.560 --> 01:19.320
Chinese government documents, was asked by the Australian to verify the paper. He says

01:19.320 --> 01:23.000
the document definitely isn't fake.

01:23.000 --> 01:28.840
News.com.au says it got all its information from the Australian newspaper because as luck

01:28.840 --> 01:36.020
would have it both media outlets are run by News Corp, owned by my old boss Rupert Murdoch.

01:36.020 --> 01:41.460
So both stories should have reported the same facts. You would have thought. But it turns

01:41.460 --> 01:47.720
out they don't. I read the Australian story online so this is just a screenshot. The article

01:47.720 --> 01:53.300
leads with this. The document, written by People's Liberation Army scientists and senior

01:53.300 --> 01:59.440
Chinese public health officials in 2015, was obtained by the US State Department as it

01:59.440 --> 02:06.800
conducted an investigation into the origins of Covid-19, the Weekend Australian has confirmed.

02:06.800 --> 02:11.160
That certainly sounds secret, although the Australian doesn't actually say that the document

02:11.160 --> 02:18.020
was secret. Then it changes from a document to a paper. The paper describes SARS coronaviruses

02:18.020 --> 02:24.040
as heralding a new era of genetic weapons and says they can be artificially manipulated

02:24.040 --> 02:30.000
into an emerging human disease virus, then weaponised and unleashed in a way never seen

02:30.000 --> 02:36.580
before. The revelation? But hang on, is this really a revelation? After all, it's been

02:36.580 --> 02:41.500
known for years that viruses can be engineered and weaponised. That's been the subject of

02:41.500 --> 02:48.340
discussion by military analysts and intelligence organisations for decades, not just in China.

02:48.340 --> 02:54.420
There's nothing in the Australian article to support news.com.au's assertion of an actual

02:54.420 --> 03:00.940
plan to unleash coronaviruses. So where did the Australian get this from?

03:00.940 --> 03:07.340
The Revelation features in an upcoming investigative book on the origins of Covid-19, titled What

03:07.340 --> 03:13.940
Really Happened in Wuhan, to be published by HarperCollins. And as luck would have it,

03:13.940 --> 03:20.100
the author of that book, Shari Markson, also works for News Corp. She not only writes for

03:20.100 --> 03:25.540
the Australian, she's a commentator on News Corp's Sky News, where she first revealed

03:25.540 --> 03:28.300
the contents of this leaked document.

03:28.300 --> 03:34.480
New details from a document produced by Chinese military scientists, where they discuss weaponising

03:34.480 --> 03:40.740
SARS coronaviruses five years before the pandemic hit. The book was written by…

03:40.740 --> 03:47.420
Hang on, a book? This was a book? I thought this was… yeah, and not just any old Chinese

03:47.420 --> 03:52.220
document, this was supposed to be a leaked Chinese document obtained by the US State

03:52.220 --> 03:59.420
Department. But sure enough, I put a translated title into Wordsearch, and there it was. Not

03:59.420 --> 04:05.560
only is this leaked document in fact a book, it was for sale on Amazon. Yeah, you could

04:05.560 --> 04:11.220
once buy this book online, assuming you could afford it. The reason you can't do so now

04:11.220 --> 04:17.980
is that it was published six years ago, so hardly a revelation.

04:18.340 --> 04:22.860
Even if it's a six year old book, that doesn't change the fact that it reveals China's

04:22.860 --> 04:28.260
sinister plan to unleash coronaviruses on the world. But this is the first thing that

04:28.260 --> 04:34.640
struck me as odd. Why would the Chinese government hatch a sinister plan to bioengineer a deadly

04:34.640 --> 04:40.620
virus in order to unleash it on the world, and then reveal the plan in a book and sell

04:40.620 --> 04:47.740
it on Amazon? Sorry, just leaving you with that thought for a second.

04:47.740 --> 04:53.220
Secondly, since the book would have been purchased and avidly read by intelligence agencies around

04:53.220 --> 04:58.980
the world six years ago when it was published, how come they didn't see this as a sinister

04:58.980 --> 05:06.100
plan to unleash a deadly virus on the world, or warn against it, or publicly condemn it?

05:06.100 --> 05:10.140
No one writing about this has actually read the book, they're all relying on the information

05:10.180 --> 05:16.460
about the contents from just one source, a commentator on Sky News. But in fact, she

05:16.460 --> 05:21.940
doesn't say the book reveals a sinister plan to unleash coronaviruses at all. She

05:21.940 --> 05:26.460
only says that the scientists discussed weaponising SARS coronaviruses.

05:26.460 --> 05:33.020
It describes SARS coronaviruses as heralding, and I quote, a new era of genetic weapons.

05:33.020 --> 05:40.100
It says they can be artificially manipulated into an emerging human disease virus, weaponised

05:40.620 --> 05:44.780
and unleashed in a way never seen before.

05:44.780 --> 05:47.620
And here are two more quotes that are interesting.

05:47.620 --> 05:52.980
Biological weapons attacks could cause catastrophic harm. They could inflict widespread injury

05:52.980 --> 05:59.820
and result in massive casualties and economic disruption. China possesses formidable capabilities.

05:59.820 --> 06:02.980
That's pretty damning evidence.

06:02.980 --> 06:07.980
In fact, this quote doesn't actually come from the book. It's from a publicly obtainable

06:08.020 --> 06:13.980
document published by the White House in 2004. All I've done is substitute the word China

06:13.980 --> 06:19.660
instead of the United States. If we see the quotes in context, you can see they have a

06:19.660 --> 06:24.660
completely different meaning. The reason they have these discussions and do a lot of research

06:24.660 --> 06:30.580
in this area is because the possibility of a viral attack is of great concern.

06:30.580 --> 06:37.580
The significance of this paper is that it offers a rare insight into how senior scientists

06:37.580 --> 06:43.460
at one of the PLA's most prominent military universities, where high levels of defence

06:43.460 --> 06:47.660
research are conducted, were thinking about biological research.

06:47.660 --> 06:52.460
But I thought the most significant thing in this book was supposed to be that it reveals

06:52.460 --> 06:59.380
a sinister Chinese plan to unleash coronaviruses on the world. To uncover this sinister plan,

06:59.380 --> 07:04.620
we need to see exactly what the discussion entailed. I can't get hold of a copy of the

07:04.620 --> 07:09.620
book, of course, it's out of print, so I first checked a description of the book by the two

07:09.620 --> 07:16.620
authors on the Amazon website. And yes indeed, they are discussing the weaponisation of SARS

07:16.620 --> 07:22.820
virus, because they see it as a threat. Their conclusion is that another country may have

07:22.820 --> 07:27.460
created the SARS virus and unleashed it on China.

07:27.460 --> 07:32.480
I also found an extensive review of the book by a reader, written long before the Sky News

07:32.480 --> 07:38.760
story went to air, and he relays the same conclusion. This book suspects that the SARS

07:38.760 --> 07:45.660
virus was actually produced by a foreign laboratory. Further into her programme, Markson also says

07:45.660 --> 07:47.560
that's the book's conclusion.

07:47.560 --> 07:54.360
They claim, and it's a conspiracy theory, that the first SARS from 2003 was a man-made

07:54.360 --> 08:00.680
bioweapon deliberately unleashed on China by terrorists. Of course, scientific consensus

08:00.680 --> 08:06.320
holds that SARS was of natural origin and that it crossed the xenographic barrier from

08:06.320 --> 08:12.120
palm civets to humans, likely through the sale of wild animals in wet markets. So this

08:12.120 --> 08:17.840
is a very odd conspiracy theory for a senior Chinese military scientist to be pushing about

08:17.840 --> 08:26.160
the SARS pandemic of 2003. And it's very similar to China now claiming that the COVID-19 pandemic

08:26.160 --> 08:30.800
was brought into Wuhan in frozen food or by the American military.

08:30.800 --> 08:36.640
Yes, I feel your pain, Shari. The book is nothing more than a conspiracy theory that

08:36.640 --> 08:42.420
foreign enemies, and Taiwan was specifically mentioned, engineered SARS and launched it

08:42.420 --> 08:48.880
against China. Now it's clear why the People's Liberation Army wanted this book to be published

08:48.880 --> 08:53.480
and sold around the world. If you believe what this book says, then you've got an

08:53.480 --> 08:59.480
awful lot of faith in what the Chinese government says and in unsubstantiated conspiracy theories

08:59.480 --> 09:05.600
coming out of Beijing. So despite the rather dramatic innuendo in Marksman's opening,

09:05.600 --> 09:11.560
she never said China had a plan to unleash coronaviruses. That part was invented later

09:11.560 --> 09:17.320
along the information trail, which now looks like this. A publicly available book that

09:17.320 --> 09:22.360
looks at the possibility that a foreign country had weaponised SARS and launched it against

09:22.360 --> 09:29.020
China becomes a book discussing weaponising SARS, and that becomes a document obtained

09:29.020 --> 09:35.880
by the US State Department discussing weaponising SARS, and that becomes a leaked document revealing

09:35.880 --> 09:44.100
a sinister plan to unleash coronaviruses. So where in this chain of shame did the information

09:44.100 --> 09:50.460
get changed? Well, Shari Marksman's account of the book is largely accurate and supported

09:50.460 --> 09:56.060
by the authors themselves and by a reader. But she used disembodied quotes to make it

09:56.060 --> 10:01.820
sound as though this had something to do with the current SARS-CoV-2 pandemic without offering

10:01.820 --> 10:07.580
a shred of evidence that it did. The Australian hyped that further and made it sound as though

10:07.580 --> 10:13.700
this was some kind of a secret document. But the real break comes when news.com.au gets

10:13.700 --> 10:20.140
hold of the story and replaces the word book with leaked document and substitutes a discussion

10:20.140 --> 10:27.460
about the weaponisation of SARS with a sinister Chinese plan to weaponise SARS, and that gets

10:27.460 --> 10:33.020
copied and passed round the world. Of course, we had broken the big breaking news about

10:33.020 --> 10:42.480
how the Chinese military had of course planned a biological warfare using the Covid-19 virus.

10:42.480 --> 10:47.660
As you can see on your screens, the article written by an Australian publication, which

10:47.660 --> 10:53.540
says that the Chinese scientists and the People Liberation Army in fact put their heads

10:53.540 --> 10:59.260
together and came out with a document and wrote about how they were going to use the

10:59.260 --> 11:04.620
SARS virus against the world. This kind of misinformation is exactly the

11:04.620 --> 11:09.680
kind of thing you see in China all the time. News outlets that are ordered to follow a

11:09.680 --> 11:16.180
particular line and facts that are ignored or invented in order to push that line. Do

11:16.180 --> 11:22.860
we really want to see Western media descend to the same level of manipulation and propaganda?

11:22.860 --> 11:25.420
Too late, but I think we can do better.
