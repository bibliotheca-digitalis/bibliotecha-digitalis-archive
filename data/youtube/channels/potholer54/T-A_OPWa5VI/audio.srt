1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,920
My thanks to all those who suggested, or defiantly challenged me to debunk some supposedly higher

2
00:00:05,920 --> 00:00:10,640
hanging fruit that you thought would be hard to debunk. I'll tackle those over the next

3
00:00:10,640 --> 00:00:15,440
couple of videos. But I thought I'd start with this one because several people suggested

4
00:00:15,440 --> 00:00:22,280
it and because the story is quite recent. The link led me to this blog.

5
00:00:22,280 --> 00:00:27,200
Now this isn't something I'd normally cover because it hasn't got much science content,

6
00:00:27,200 --> 00:00:31,960
but it is about scientists weaponising a virus and it's been widely reported and

7
00:00:31,960 --> 00:00:35,600
believed so I'm happy to accept.

8
00:00:35,600 --> 00:00:41,360
Debunking anything is a simple matter of finding the source in a series of steps. In this case

9
00:00:41,360 --> 00:00:47,020
the first step is easy because the source is right there at the bottom of the page.

10
00:00:47,020 --> 00:00:54,040
It links to this story by Rhea Matthews on news.com.au saying a leaked Chinese document

11
00:00:54,040 --> 00:01:00,660
reveals a sinister plan to unleash coronavirus. And it quotes the Executive Director of the

12
00:01:00,660 --> 00:01:06,880
Australian Strategic Policy Institute Peter Jennings as saying this is as close to a smoking

13
00:01:06,880 --> 00:01:13,560
gun as we've got. It also says Robert Potter, a cyber security specialist who analyses leaked

14
00:01:13,560 --> 00:01:19,320
Chinese government documents, was asked by the Australian to verify the paper. He says

15
00:01:19,320 --> 00:01:23,000
the document definitely isn't fake.

16
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:28,840
News.com.au says it got all its information from the Australian newspaper because as luck

17
00:01:28,840 --> 00:01:36,020
would have it both media outlets are run by News Corp, owned by my old boss Rupert Murdoch.

18
00:01:36,020 --> 00:01:41,460
So both stories should have reported the same facts. You would have thought. But it turns

19
00:01:41,460 --> 00:01:47,720
out they don't. I read the Australian story online so this is just a screenshot. The article

20
00:01:47,720 --> 00:01:53,300
leads with this. The document, written by People's Liberation Army scientists and senior

21
00:01:53,300 --> 00:01:59,440
Chinese public health officials in 2015, was obtained by the US State Department as it

22
00:01:59,440 --> 00:02:06,800
conducted an investigation into the origins of Covid-19, the Weekend Australian has confirmed.

23
00:02:06,800 --> 00:02:11,160
That certainly sounds secret, although the Australian doesn't actually say that the document

24
00:02:11,160 --> 00:02:18,020
was secret. Then it changes from a document to a paper. The paper describes SARS coronaviruses

25
00:02:18,020 --> 00:02:24,040
as heralding a new era of genetic weapons and says they can be artificially manipulated

26
00:02:24,040 --> 00:02:30,000
into an emerging human disease virus, then weaponised and unleashed in a way never seen

27
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:36,580
before. The revelation? But hang on, is this really a revelation? After all, it's been

28
00:02:36,580 --> 00:02:41,500
known for years that viruses can be engineered and weaponised. That's been the subject of

29
00:02:41,500 --> 00:02:48,340
discussion by military analysts and intelligence organisations for decades, not just in China.

30
00:02:48,340 --> 00:02:54,420
There's nothing in the Australian article to support news.com.au's assertion of an actual

31
00:02:54,420 --> 00:03:00,940
plan to unleash coronaviruses. So where did the Australian get this from?

32
00:03:00,940 --> 00:03:07,340
The Revelation features in an upcoming investigative book on the origins of Covid-19, titled What

33
00:03:07,340 --> 00:03:13,940
Really Happened in Wuhan, to be published by HarperCollins. And as luck would have it,

34
00:03:13,940 --> 00:03:20,100
the author of that book, Shari Markson, also works for News Corp. She not only writes for

35
00:03:20,100 --> 00:03:25,540
the Australian, she's a commentator on News Corp's Sky News, where she first revealed

36
00:03:25,540 --> 00:03:28,300
the contents of this leaked document.

37
00:03:28,300 --> 00:03:34,480
New details from a document produced by Chinese military scientists, where they discuss weaponising

38
00:03:34,480 --> 00:03:40,740
SARS coronaviruses five years before the pandemic hit. The book was written by…

39
00:03:40,740 --> 00:03:47,420
Hang on, a book? This was a book? I thought this was… yeah, and not just any old Chinese

40
00:03:47,420 --> 00:03:52,220
document, this was supposed to be a leaked Chinese document obtained by the US State

41
00:03:52,220 --> 00:03:59,420
Department. But sure enough, I put a translated title into Wordsearch, and there it was. Not

42
00:03:59,420 --> 00:04:05,560
only is this leaked document in fact a book, it was for sale on Amazon. Yeah, you could

43
00:04:05,560 --> 00:04:11,220
once buy this book online, assuming you could afford it. The reason you can't do so now

44
00:04:11,220 --> 00:04:17,980
is that it was published six years ago, so hardly a revelation.

45
00:04:18,340 --> 00:04:22,860
Even if it's a six year old book, that doesn't change the fact that it reveals China's

46
00:04:22,860 --> 00:04:28,260
sinister plan to unleash coronaviruses on the world. But this is the first thing that

47
00:04:28,260 --> 00:04:34,640
struck me as odd. Why would the Chinese government hatch a sinister plan to bioengineer a deadly

48
00:04:34,640 --> 00:04:40,620
virus in order to unleash it on the world, and then reveal the plan in a book and sell

49
00:04:40,620 --> 00:04:47,740
it on Amazon? Sorry, just leaving you with that thought for a second.

50
00:04:47,740 --> 00:04:53,220
Secondly, since the book would have been purchased and avidly read by intelligence agencies around

51
00:04:53,220 --> 00:04:58,980
the world six years ago when it was published, how come they didn't see this as a sinister

52
00:04:58,980 --> 00:05:06,100
plan to unleash a deadly virus on the world, or warn against it, or publicly condemn it?

53
00:05:06,100 --> 00:05:10,140
No one writing about this has actually read the book, they're all relying on the information

54
00:05:10,180 --> 00:05:16,460
about the contents from just one source, a commentator on Sky News. But in fact, she

55
00:05:16,460 --> 00:05:21,940
doesn't say the book reveals a sinister plan to unleash coronaviruses at all. She

56
00:05:21,940 --> 00:05:26,460
only says that the scientists discussed weaponising SARS coronaviruses.

57
00:05:26,460 --> 00:05:33,020
It describes SARS coronaviruses as heralding, and I quote, a new era of genetic weapons.

58
00:05:33,020 --> 00:05:40,100
It says they can be artificially manipulated into an emerging human disease virus, weaponised

59
00:05:40,620 --> 00:05:44,780
and unleashed in a way never seen before.

60
00:05:44,780 --> 00:05:47,620
And here are two more quotes that are interesting.

61
00:05:47,620 --> 00:05:52,980
Biological weapons attacks could cause catastrophic harm. They could inflict widespread injury

62
00:05:52,980 --> 00:05:59,820
and result in massive casualties and economic disruption. China possesses formidable capabilities.

63
00:05:59,820 --> 00:06:02,980
That's pretty damning evidence.

64
00:06:02,980 --> 00:06:07,980
In fact, this quote doesn't actually come from the book. It's from a publicly obtainable

65
00:06:08,020 --> 00:06:13,980
document published by the White House in 2004. All I've done is substitute the word China

66
00:06:13,980 --> 00:06:19,660
instead of the United States. If we see the quotes in context, you can see they have a

67
00:06:19,660 --> 00:06:24,660
completely different meaning. The reason they have these discussions and do a lot of research

68
00:06:24,660 --> 00:06:30,580
in this area is because the possibility of a viral attack is of great concern.

69
00:06:30,580 --> 00:06:37,580
The significance of this paper is that it offers a rare insight into how senior scientists

70
00:06:37,580 --> 00:06:43,460
at one of the PLA's most prominent military universities, where high levels of defence

71
00:06:43,460 --> 00:06:47,660
research are conducted, were thinking about biological research.

72
00:06:47,660 --> 00:06:52,460
But I thought the most significant thing in this book was supposed to be that it reveals

73
00:06:52,460 --> 00:06:59,380
a sinister Chinese plan to unleash coronaviruses on the world. To uncover this sinister plan,

74
00:06:59,380 --> 00:07:04,620
we need to see exactly what the discussion entailed. I can't get hold of a copy of the

75
00:07:04,620 --> 00:07:09,620
book, of course, it's out of print, so I first checked a description of the book by the two

76
00:07:09,620 --> 00:07:16,620
authors on the Amazon website. And yes indeed, they are discussing the weaponisation of SARS

77
00:07:16,620 --> 00:07:22,820
virus, because they see it as a threat. Their conclusion is that another country may have

78
00:07:22,820 --> 00:07:27,460
created the SARS virus and unleashed it on China.

79
00:07:27,460 --> 00:07:32,480
I also found an extensive review of the book by a reader, written long before the Sky News

80
00:07:32,480 --> 00:07:38,760
story went to air, and he relays the same conclusion. This book suspects that the SARS

81
00:07:38,760 --> 00:07:45,660
virus was actually produced by a foreign laboratory. Further into her programme, Markson also says

82
00:07:45,660 --> 00:07:47,560
that's the book's conclusion.

83
00:07:47,560 --> 00:07:54,360
They claim, and it's a conspiracy theory, that the first SARS from 2003 was a man-made

84
00:07:54,360 --> 00:08:00,680
bioweapon deliberately unleashed on China by terrorists. Of course, scientific consensus

85
00:08:00,680 --> 00:08:06,320
holds that SARS was of natural origin and that it crossed the xenographic barrier from

86
00:08:06,320 --> 00:08:12,120
palm civets to humans, likely through the sale of wild animals in wet markets. So this

87
00:08:12,120 --> 00:08:17,840
is a very odd conspiracy theory for a senior Chinese military scientist to be pushing about

88
00:08:17,840 --> 00:08:26,160
the SARS pandemic of 2003. And it's very similar to China now claiming that the COVID-19 pandemic

89
00:08:26,160 --> 00:08:30,800
was brought into Wuhan in frozen food or by the American military.

90
00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:36,640
Yes, I feel your pain, Shari. The book is nothing more than a conspiracy theory that

91
00:08:36,640 --> 00:08:42,420
foreign enemies, and Taiwan was specifically mentioned, engineered SARS and launched it

92
00:08:42,420 --> 00:08:48,880
against China. Now it's clear why the People's Liberation Army wanted this book to be published

93
00:08:48,880 --> 00:08:53,480
and sold around the world. If you believe what this book says, then you've got an

94
00:08:53,480 --> 00:08:59,480
awful lot of faith in what the Chinese government says and in unsubstantiated conspiracy theories

95
00:08:59,480 --> 00:09:05,600
coming out of Beijing. So despite the rather dramatic innuendo in Marksman's opening,

96
00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:11,560
she never said China had a plan to unleash coronaviruses. That part was invented later

97
00:09:11,560 --> 00:09:17,320
along the information trail, which now looks like this. A publicly available book that

98
00:09:17,320 --> 00:09:22,360
looks at the possibility that a foreign country had weaponised SARS and launched it against

99
00:09:22,360 --> 00:09:29,020
China becomes a book discussing weaponising SARS, and that becomes a document obtained

100
00:09:29,020 --> 00:09:35,880
by the US State Department discussing weaponising SARS, and that becomes a leaked document revealing

101
00:09:35,880 --> 00:09:44,100
a sinister plan to unleash coronaviruses. So where in this chain of shame did the information

102
00:09:44,100 --> 00:09:50,460
get changed? Well, Shari Marksman's account of the book is largely accurate and supported

103
00:09:50,460 --> 00:09:56,060
by the authors themselves and by a reader. But she used disembodied quotes to make it

104
00:09:56,060 --> 00:10:01,820
sound as though this had something to do with the current SARS-CoV-2 pandemic without offering

105
00:10:01,820 --> 00:10:07,580
a shred of evidence that it did. The Australian hyped that further and made it sound as though

106
00:10:07,580 --> 00:10:13,700
this was some kind of a secret document. But the real break comes when news.com.au gets

107
00:10:13,700 --> 00:10:20,140
hold of the story and replaces the word book with leaked document and substitutes a discussion

108
00:10:20,140 --> 00:10:27,460
about the weaponisation of SARS with a sinister Chinese plan to weaponise SARS, and that gets

109
00:10:27,460 --> 00:10:33,020
copied and passed round the world. Of course, we had broken the big breaking news about

110
00:10:33,020 --> 00:10:42,480
how the Chinese military had of course planned a biological warfare using the Covid-19 virus.

111
00:10:42,480 --> 00:10:47,660
As you can see on your screens, the article written by an Australian publication, which

112
00:10:47,660 --> 00:10:53,540
says that the Chinese scientists and the People Liberation Army in fact put their heads

113
00:10:53,540 --> 00:10:59,260
together and came out with a document and wrote about how they were going to use the

114
00:10:59,260 --> 00:11:04,620
SARS virus against the world. This kind of misinformation is exactly the

115
00:11:04,620 --> 00:11:09,680
kind of thing you see in China all the time. News outlets that are ordered to follow a

116
00:11:09,680 --> 00:11:16,180
particular line and facts that are ignored or invented in order to push that line. Do

117
00:11:16,180 --> 00:11:22,860
we really want to see Western media descend to the same level of manipulation and propaganda?

118
00:11:22,860 --> 00:11:25,420
Too late, but I think we can do better.
