00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:19,040
In part one of this video I looked at our growing knowledge of the universe and how

2
00:00:19,040 --> 00:00:23,540
humans became aware of its scale in time and space.

3
00:00:23,540 --> 00:00:28,680
Now I want to explain what that knowledge tells us about how our universe unfolded,

4
00:00:28,680 --> 00:00:34,400
how the stars and galaxies formed and how the Earth was created, not by magic but by

5
00:00:34,400 --> 00:00:47,000
physical processes we know and understand.

6
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:52,240
Our universe, which may be one of several in time and space, started with a huge explosion

7
00:00:52,240 --> 00:00:55,200
of energy and matter called the Big Bang.

8
00:00:55,200 --> 00:01:01,320
Neutrons, protons and electrons rode in the wake of an expansion of time and space itself.

9
00:01:01,320 --> 00:01:07,360
After 380,000 years the universe had cooled enough for these particles to come together

10
00:01:07,360 --> 00:01:14,320
to form the first atoms. Nearly three-quarters of them was simple hydrogen, just one proton

11
00:01:14,320 --> 00:01:21,200
and one electron. 28% were helium, which has two protons, two neutrons and two electrons.

12
00:01:21,200 --> 00:01:27,520
Cosmologists thought this cloud of matter must have been patchy,

13
00:01:27,520 --> 00:01:32,740
denser in some parts than others. Otherwise the denser parts couldn't have come together

14
00:01:32,740 --> 00:01:38,680
later to form stars. Based on the state of our present universe and theoretical models

15
00:01:38,680 --> 00:01:43,320
of the Big Bang, they predicted what this patchy early universe would have looked like.

16
00:01:43,320 --> 00:01:49,240
Denser clouds are always a few millionths of a degree warmer than the emptier parts of our

17
00:01:49,280 --> 00:01:55,520
cosmos. So cosmologists knew that if they could look back 13 billion years they should be able

18
00:01:55,520 --> 00:02:00,920
to see the heat imprint of these early clouds of particles. They'd have to find background

19
00:02:00,920 --> 00:02:09,720
temperatures from the universe's furthest reaches. The instrument that achieved this was NASA's

20
00:02:09,720 --> 00:02:16,840
Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe. It spent two years collecting data from 13 billion light

21
00:02:16,880 --> 00:02:23,000
years away, which meant it was not only looking deep into space but also 13 billion years back

22
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:30,680
in time. Then in 2003 the picture was ready and the world caught its first glimpse of our universe

23
00:02:30,680 --> 00:02:39,200
at birth. What you're looking at is a picture of our universe just 380,000 years after it was born,

24
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:46,200
as the first atoms were being formed. It's like seeing the photo of an 80 year old man just 19

25
00:02:46,200 --> 00:02:52,600
hours after his birth. The red areas are warmer clouds of matter, the blue areas colder and

26
00:02:52,600 --> 00:03:00,440
emptier. Hydrogen and helium, protons and neutrons drifting in a dark cosmos. The Wilkinson probe

27
00:03:00,440 --> 00:03:07,360
results were hailed as a scientific breakthrough. They matched the predictions perfectly. Over

28
00:03:07,360 --> 00:03:12,600
millions of years gravitational attraction pulled many of these denser clouds of matter closer

29
00:03:12,760 --> 00:03:18,600
together and the more dense they became the greater the gravitational attraction. Just as

30
00:03:18,600 --> 00:03:24,920
a spinning skater spins faster when she pulls in her outstretched arms each swirling cloud began

31
00:03:24,920 --> 00:03:31,840
to spin until they became tight balls of rotating gas. Inside each ball of gas the pressure

32
00:03:31,840 --> 00:03:38,040
increased. Whenever a gas is compressed it heats up so hydrogen atoms in the centre of the cloud

33
00:03:38,160 --> 00:03:43,680
started vibrating faster and faster until they were crashing into each other at such high speed

34
00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:50,400
they began to fuse to form helium. Each nuclear fusion reaction is accompanied by the release of

35
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:57,000
energy. The energy makes other hydrogen atoms vibrate even faster fusing more of them releasing

36
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:04,040
more energy that fuses more atoms and in a split second a chain reaction. Like trillions of hydrogen

37
00:04:04,040 --> 00:04:10,200
bombs exploding at once the ball of gas ignites. The first stars illuminate the cosmos.

38
00:04:10,200 --> 00:04:36,880
Early swarms of stars were also drawn together by gravitation forming galaxies. The first

39
00:04:36,880 --> 00:04:44,920
stars burned for billions of years powered by fusion. But a star has only so much hydrogen fuel.

40
00:04:44,920 --> 00:04:51,320
As the energy is used up the star begins to collapse pulling the gas ball tighter. Pressure

41
00:04:51,320 --> 00:04:57,320
and temperature increase until they're high enough for helium atoms to crash together and fuse. This

42
00:04:57,320 --> 00:05:03,840
makes heavier atoms like carbon and then oxygen. With higher temperatures and pressures even these

43
00:05:03,840 --> 00:05:11,320
atoms fuse until the star becomes a white-hot factory. The energy from these reactions is far

44
00:05:11,320 --> 00:05:17,160
greater than the fusion of hydrogen. Finally the temperature and pressure are so high that the star

45
00:05:17,160 --> 00:05:23,960
explodes spewing its contents into space. Often the shockwaves throw these heavier elements against

46
00:05:23,960 --> 00:05:29,480
clouds of hydrogen and helium that have been dormant in space for billions of years. This

47
00:05:29,520 --> 00:05:34,440
cloud hadn't been dense enough to pull together under gravitation but the sudden jolt from the

48
00:05:34,440 --> 00:05:41,960
exploded star stirs it. Now gravitation starts to pull the denser areas closer together. The

49
00:05:41,960 --> 00:06:03,240
life cycle of a star begins again. Only this time things are different. This time the cloud

50
00:06:03,240 --> 00:06:09,560
of gas is laden with heavier elements. Thanks to spectroscopy explained in part one of this video

51
00:06:09,760 --> 00:06:15,440
we can measure the proportion of the different elements in stars and in our own Sun. Because

52
00:06:15,440 --> 00:06:20,560
stars have been forming since our universe began we can see them in all their different stages of

53
00:06:20,560 --> 00:06:30,400
development from their inception to birth maturity old age and death. So we know the rate at which

54
00:06:30,400 --> 00:06:36,920
hydrogen and helium fuse. The proportion of the two elements tells us the age of the star. Our Sun

55
00:06:36,920 --> 00:06:42,920
is about halfway through its life cycle which makes it about five billion years old. So five

56
00:06:42,920 --> 00:06:48,480
billion years ago a nondescript cloud of gas must have come together in this way and formed a

57
00:06:48,480 --> 00:06:55,640
medium-sized rather nondescript star on the edge of a very ordinary spiral galaxy. As it formed the

58
00:06:55,640 --> 00:07:01,000
heavier elements in the cloud created rings of dust in orbit. Over time these came together

59
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:07,560
under gravitational attraction to make tiny rocks then larger rocks a process known as accretion.

60
00:07:07,560 --> 00:07:14,720
This isn't an extraordinary process. In our tiny corner of the universe alone cosmologists have

61
00:07:14,720 --> 00:07:21,040
detected hundreds of planets so there could be billions of them in just our galaxy. Some would

62
00:07:21,040 --> 00:07:27,200
be too close to a star and water would boil away in the intense heat. Others would be too far and

63
00:07:27,240 --> 00:07:33,920
water would freeze. But for any planet in an orbit between those two extremes water would be liquid

64
00:07:33,920 --> 00:07:40,360
just like on earth. Within a few hundred million years accretion had created a huge ball of rock

65
00:07:40,360 --> 00:07:45,600
that would become our planet. At first it was molten because of the energy of millions of

66
00:07:45,600 --> 00:07:52,040
collisions then the molten ball began to cool and a hardened crust formed over it. A few million

67
00:07:52,240 --> 00:07:57,480
years after it formed the earth was cool enough for water to condense and over the next billion

68
00:07:57,480 --> 00:08:03,600
years chemical reactions created replicating molecules that would one day evolve into simple

69
00:08:03,600 --> 00:08:03,920
cells.
