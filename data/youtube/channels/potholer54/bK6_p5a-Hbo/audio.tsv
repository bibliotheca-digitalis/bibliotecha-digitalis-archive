0	19040	In part one of this video I looked at our growing knowledge of the universe and how
19040	23540	humans became aware of its scale in time and space.
23540	28680	Now I want to explain what that knowledge tells us about how our universe unfolded,
28680	34400	how the stars and galaxies formed and how the Earth was created, not by magic but by
34400	47000	physical processes we know and understand.
47000	52240	Our universe, which may be one of several in time and space, started with a huge explosion
52240	55200	of energy and matter called the Big Bang.
55200	61320	Neutrons, protons and electrons rode in the wake of an expansion of time and space itself.
61320	67360	After 380,000 years the universe had cooled enough for these particles to come together
67360	74320	to form the first atoms. Nearly three-quarters of them was simple hydrogen, just one proton
74320	81200	and one electron. 28% were helium, which has two protons, two neutrons and two electrons.
81200	87520	Cosmologists thought this cloud of matter must have been patchy,
87520	92740	denser in some parts than others. Otherwise the denser parts couldn't have come together
92740	98680	later to form stars. Based on the state of our present universe and theoretical models
98680	103320	of the Big Bang, they predicted what this patchy early universe would have looked like.
103320	109240	Denser clouds are always a few millionths of a degree warmer than the emptier parts of our
109280	115520	cosmos. So cosmologists knew that if they could look back 13 billion years they should be able
115520	120920	to see the heat imprint of these early clouds of particles. They'd have to find background
120920	129720	temperatures from the universe's furthest reaches. The instrument that achieved this was NASA's
129720	136840	Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe. It spent two years collecting data from 13 billion light
136880	143000	years away, which meant it was not only looking deep into space but also 13 billion years back
143000	150680	in time. Then in 2003 the picture was ready and the world caught its first glimpse of our universe
150680	159200	at birth. What you're looking at is a picture of our universe just 380,000 years after it was born,
159200	166200	as the first atoms were being formed. It's like seeing the photo of an 80 year old man just 19
166200	172600	hours after his birth. The red areas are warmer clouds of matter, the blue areas colder and
172600	180440	emptier. Hydrogen and helium, protons and neutrons drifting in a dark cosmos. The Wilkinson probe
180440	187360	results were hailed as a scientific breakthrough. They matched the predictions perfectly. Over
187360	192600	millions of years gravitational attraction pulled many of these denser clouds of matter closer
192760	198600	together and the more dense they became the greater the gravitational attraction. Just as
198600	204920	a spinning skater spins faster when she pulls in her outstretched arms each swirling cloud began
204920	211840	to spin until they became tight balls of rotating gas. Inside each ball of gas the pressure
211840	218040	increased. Whenever a gas is compressed it heats up so hydrogen atoms in the centre of the cloud
218160	223680	started vibrating faster and faster until they were crashing into each other at such high speed
223680	230400	they began to fuse to form helium. Each nuclear fusion reaction is accompanied by the release of
230400	237000	energy. The energy makes other hydrogen atoms vibrate even faster fusing more of them releasing
237000	244040	more energy that fuses more atoms and in a split second a chain reaction. Like trillions of hydrogen
244040	250200	bombs exploding at once the ball of gas ignites. The first stars illuminate the cosmos.
250200	276880	Early swarms of stars were also drawn together by gravitation forming galaxies. The first
276880	284920	stars burned for billions of years powered by fusion. But a star has only so much hydrogen fuel.
284920	291320	As the energy is used up the star begins to collapse pulling the gas ball tighter. Pressure
291320	297320	and temperature increase until they're high enough for helium atoms to crash together and fuse. This
297320	303840	makes heavier atoms like carbon and then oxygen. With higher temperatures and pressures even these
303840	311320	atoms fuse until the star becomes a white-hot factory. The energy from these reactions is far
311320	317160	greater than the fusion of hydrogen. Finally the temperature and pressure are so high that the star
317160	323960	explodes spewing its contents into space. Often the shockwaves throw these heavier elements against
323960	329480	clouds of hydrogen and helium that have been dormant in space for billions of years. This
329520	334440	cloud hadn't been dense enough to pull together under gravitation but the sudden jolt from the
334440	341960	exploded star stirs it. Now gravitation starts to pull the denser areas closer together. The
341960	363240	life cycle of a star begins again. Only this time things are different. This time the cloud
363240	369560	of gas is laden with heavier elements. Thanks to spectroscopy explained in part one of this video
369760	375440	we can measure the proportion of the different elements in stars and in our own Sun. Because
375440	380560	stars have been forming since our universe began we can see them in all their different stages of
380560	390400	development from their inception to birth maturity old age and death. So we know the rate at which
390400	396920	hydrogen and helium fuse. The proportion of the two elements tells us the age of the star. Our Sun
396920	402920	is about halfway through its life cycle which makes it about five billion years old. So five
402920	408480	billion years ago a nondescript cloud of gas must have come together in this way and formed a
408480	415640	medium-sized rather nondescript star on the edge of a very ordinary spiral galaxy. As it formed the
415640	421000	heavier elements in the cloud created rings of dust in orbit. Over time these came together
421000	427560	under gravitational attraction to make tiny rocks then larger rocks a process known as accretion.
427560	434720	This isn't an extraordinary process. In our tiny corner of the universe alone cosmologists have
434720	441040	detected hundreds of planets so there could be billions of them in just our galaxy. Some would
441040	447200	be too close to a star and water would boil away in the intense heat. Others would be too far and
447240	453920	water would freeze. But for any planet in an orbit between those two extremes water would be liquid
453920	460360	just like on earth. Within a few hundred million years accretion had created a huge ball of rock
460360	465600	that would become our planet. At first it was molten because of the energy of millions of
465600	472040	collisions then the molten ball began to cool and a hardened crust formed over it. A few million
472240	477480	years after it formed the earth was cool enough for water to condense and over the next billion
477480	483600	years chemical reactions created replicating molecules that would one day evolve into simple
483600	483920	cells.
