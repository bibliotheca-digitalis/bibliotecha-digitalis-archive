00:00.000 --> 00:19.040
In part one of this video I looked at our growing knowledge of the universe and how

00:19.040 --> 00:23.540
humans became aware of its scale in time and space.

00:23.540 --> 00:28.680
Now I want to explain what that knowledge tells us about how our universe unfolded,

00:28.680 --> 00:34.400
how the stars and galaxies formed and how the Earth was created, not by magic but by

00:34.400 --> 00:47.000
physical processes we know and understand.

00:47.000 --> 00:52.240
Our universe, which may be one of several in time and space, started with a huge explosion

00:52.240 --> 00:55.200
of energy and matter called the Big Bang.

00:55.200 --> 01:01.320
Neutrons, protons and electrons rode in the wake of an expansion of time and space itself.

01:01.320 --> 01:07.360
After 380,000 years the universe had cooled enough for these particles to come together

01:07.360 --> 01:14.320
to form the first atoms. Nearly three-quarters of them was simple hydrogen, just one proton

01:14.320 --> 01:21.200
and one electron. 28% were helium, which has two protons, two neutrons and two electrons.

01:21.200 --> 01:27.520
Cosmologists thought this cloud of matter must have been patchy,

01:27.520 --> 01:32.740
denser in some parts than others. Otherwise the denser parts couldn't have come together

01:32.740 --> 01:38.680
later to form stars. Based on the state of our present universe and theoretical models

01:38.680 --> 01:43.320
of the Big Bang, they predicted what this patchy early universe would have looked like.

01:43.320 --> 01:49.240
Denser clouds are always a few millionths of a degree warmer than the emptier parts of our

01:49.280 --> 01:55.520
cosmos. So cosmologists knew that if they could look back 13 billion years they should be able

01:55.520 --> 02:00.920
to see the heat imprint of these early clouds of particles. They'd have to find background

02:00.920 --> 02:09.720
temperatures from the universe's furthest reaches. The instrument that achieved this was NASA's

02:09.720 --> 02:16.840
Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe. It spent two years collecting data from 13 billion light

02:16.880 --> 02:23.000
years away, which meant it was not only looking deep into space but also 13 billion years back

02:23.000 --> 02:30.680
in time. Then in 2003 the picture was ready and the world caught its first glimpse of our universe

02:30.680 --> 02:39.200
at birth. What you're looking at is a picture of our universe just 380,000 years after it was born,

02:39.200 --> 02:46.200
as the first atoms were being formed. It's like seeing the photo of an 80 year old man just 19

02:46.200 --> 02:52.600
hours after his birth. The red areas are warmer clouds of matter, the blue areas colder and

02:52.600 --> 03:00.440
emptier. Hydrogen and helium, protons and neutrons drifting in a dark cosmos. The Wilkinson probe

03:00.440 --> 03:07.360
results were hailed as a scientific breakthrough. They matched the predictions perfectly. Over

03:07.360 --> 03:12.600
millions of years gravitational attraction pulled many of these denser clouds of matter closer

03:12.760 --> 03:18.600
together and the more dense they became the greater the gravitational attraction. Just as

03:18.600 --> 03:24.920
a spinning skater spins faster when she pulls in her outstretched arms each swirling cloud began

03:24.920 --> 03:31.840
to spin until they became tight balls of rotating gas. Inside each ball of gas the pressure

03:31.840 --> 03:38.040
increased. Whenever a gas is compressed it heats up so hydrogen atoms in the centre of the cloud

03:38.160 --> 03:43.680
started vibrating faster and faster until they were crashing into each other at such high speed

03:43.680 --> 03:50.400
they began to fuse to form helium. Each nuclear fusion reaction is accompanied by the release of

03:50.400 --> 03:57.000
energy. The energy makes other hydrogen atoms vibrate even faster fusing more of them releasing

03:57.000 --> 04:04.040
more energy that fuses more atoms and in a split second a chain reaction. Like trillions of hydrogen

04:04.040 --> 04:10.200
bombs exploding at once the ball of gas ignites. The first stars illuminate the cosmos.

04:10.200 --> 04:36.880
Early swarms of stars were also drawn together by gravitation forming galaxies. The first

04:36.880 --> 04:44.920
stars burned for billions of years powered by fusion. But a star has only so much hydrogen fuel.

04:44.920 --> 04:51.320
As the energy is used up the star begins to collapse pulling the gas ball tighter. Pressure

04:51.320 --> 04:57.320
and temperature increase until they're high enough for helium atoms to crash together and fuse. This

04:57.320 --> 05:03.840
makes heavier atoms like carbon and then oxygen. With higher temperatures and pressures even these

05:03.840 --> 05:11.320
atoms fuse until the star becomes a white-hot factory. The energy from these reactions is far

05:11.320 --> 05:17.160
greater than the fusion of hydrogen. Finally the temperature and pressure are so high that the star

05:17.160 --> 05:23.960
explodes spewing its contents into space. Often the shockwaves throw these heavier elements against

05:23.960 --> 05:29.480
clouds of hydrogen and helium that have been dormant in space for billions of years. This

05:29.520 --> 05:34.440
cloud hadn't been dense enough to pull together under gravitation but the sudden jolt from the

05:34.440 --> 05:41.960
exploded star stirs it. Now gravitation starts to pull the denser areas closer together. The

05:41.960 --> 06:03.240
life cycle of a star begins again. Only this time things are different. This time the cloud

06:03.240 --> 06:09.560
of gas is laden with heavier elements. Thanks to spectroscopy explained in part one of this video

06:09.760 --> 06:15.440
we can measure the proportion of the different elements in stars and in our own Sun. Because

06:15.440 --> 06:20.560
stars have been forming since our universe began we can see them in all their different stages of

06:20.560 --> 06:30.400
development from their inception to birth maturity old age and death. So we know the rate at which

06:30.400 --> 06:36.920
hydrogen and helium fuse. The proportion of the two elements tells us the age of the star. Our Sun

06:36.920 --> 06:42.920
is about halfway through its life cycle which makes it about five billion years old. So five

06:42.920 --> 06:48.480
billion years ago a nondescript cloud of gas must have come together in this way and formed a

06:48.480 --> 06:55.640
medium-sized rather nondescript star on the edge of a very ordinary spiral galaxy. As it formed the

06:55.640 --> 07:01.000
heavier elements in the cloud created rings of dust in orbit. Over time these came together

07:01.000 --> 07:07.560
under gravitational attraction to make tiny rocks then larger rocks a process known as accretion.

07:07.560 --> 07:14.720
This isn't an extraordinary process. In our tiny corner of the universe alone cosmologists have

07:14.720 --> 07:21.040
detected hundreds of planets so there could be billions of them in just our galaxy. Some would

07:21.040 --> 07:27.200
be too close to a star and water would boil away in the intense heat. Others would be too far and

07:27.240 --> 07:33.920
water would freeze. But for any planet in an orbit between those two extremes water would be liquid

07:33.920 --> 07:40.360
just like on earth. Within a few hundred million years accretion had created a huge ball of rock

07:40.360 --> 07:45.600
that would become our planet. At first it was molten because of the energy of millions of

07:45.600 --> 07:52.040
collisions then the molten ball began to cool and a hardened crust formed over it. A few million

07:52.240 --> 07:57.480
years after it formed the earth was cool enough for water to condense and over the next billion

07:57.480 --> 08:03.600
years chemical reactions created replicating molecules that would one day evolve into simple

08:03.600 --> 08:03.920
cells.
