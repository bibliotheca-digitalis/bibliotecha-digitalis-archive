WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:05.280
Well, hello there. Welcome to my video message.

00:05.280 --> 00:09.880
I know, this guy looks like he's just kidnapped your kid and he's about to give you his ransom

00:09.880 --> 00:15.860
demands. In fact, he's a former nominee for the coveted Golden Crocoduck. And since today

00:15.860 --> 00:20.780
is the Feast of St Jude Thaddeus, the painter and saint of lost causes, I thought it was

00:20.780 --> 00:24.900
a good time to make an announcement about that award.

00:24.900 --> 00:30.340
If anyone doesn't know what the coveted Golden Crocoduck is, it was awarded, well, let's

00:30.340 --> 00:32.820
let creationist Ian Juby explain.

00:32.820 --> 00:38.020
Now this award is given out to those creationists they deem to have broken the 9th commandment.

00:38.020 --> 00:44.660
Well, almost right. It was for those creationists who verifiably breached the 9th commandment,

00:44.660 --> 00:47.700
and there were always plenty of candidates to choose from.

00:47.700 --> 00:50.700
Not one transitional form has been found.

00:50.700 --> 00:52.700
There are no transitional forms.

00:52.700 --> 00:58.700
Carbon dating indicated live snails had died 27,000 years before.

00:58.700 --> 01:03.700
Shells from living snails were carbon dated at 27,000 years old.

01:03.700 --> 01:09.700
Mammoths have been found with food still in their mouths, still in their gut, that is

01:09.700 --> 01:11.700
tropical vegetation.

01:11.700 --> 01:16.700
The evolutionary textbook, you'll still find this, they're claiming that whales evolved

01:16.700 --> 01:18.700
legs and became cows.

01:18.700 --> 01:21.700
It's the stupidest thing I've ever heard.

01:21.700 --> 01:25.700
We ought to see cats, we ought to see dogs, and we ought to see cogs and dats.

01:25.700 --> 01:29.700
And all through the fossil record and life, we don't find one of these.

01:29.700 --> 01:30.700
A crocoduck.

01:30.700 --> 01:36.700
Over the years, many people have been lobbying for a return of the Golden Crocoduck, so I've

01:36.700 --> 01:42.700
listened to the pleas and decided, yes, I will bring it back, wait till I've finished,

01:42.700 --> 01:45.700
but in a more limited form.

01:45.700 --> 01:49.700
Under the old system, anyone could nominate a creationist of their choice, and every month

01:49.700 --> 01:54.700
I'd go through the nominees and fact check the information, in a very respectful way,

01:54.700 --> 02:00.700
of course, so as not to mock or belittle the sincerity of the creationists promoting these theories.

02:00.700 --> 02:04.700
The banana and the hand are perfectly made one for the other.

02:04.700 --> 02:06.700
So God has placed a tab at the top.

02:06.700 --> 02:10.700
When you pull the tab, the contents don't squirt in your face.

02:10.700 --> 02:13.700
Notice how gracefully it sits over the human hand.

02:13.700 --> 02:15.700
Notice it has a point at the top for ease of entry.

02:15.700 --> 02:18.700
It's just the right shape for the human mouth.

02:18.700 --> 02:19.700
Okay, that's enough, Ray.

02:19.700 --> 02:21.700
I'm getting palpitations.

02:21.700 --> 02:23.700
So here's the thing about the Golden Crocoduck.

02:23.700 --> 02:30.700
As you know, I tried very hard to not make it amusing or somehow belittling of these creationist ideas.

02:30.700 --> 02:36.700
I'm less interested in whether Ray Comfort is holding something God made that fits into his hand,

02:36.700 --> 02:41.700
designed for ease of entry into someone's mouth without squirting in their face.

02:41.700 --> 02:42.700
What?

02:42.700 --> 02:43.700
Oh, come on.

02:43.700 --> 02:45.700
I'm talking about his banana.

02:45.700 --> 02:47.700
I'm trying to make a serious point here.

02:47.700 --> 02:52.700
I'm less interested in that than the claim that God made the banana just like this,

02:52.700 --> 02:59.700
rather than whether the modern banana was cultivated by humans from a small, wild, seed-filled fruit.

02:59.700 --> 03:06.700
If a claim turned out to be false, and therefore a breach of one of the creationists' own most sacred commandments,

03:06.700 --> 03:10.700
it got highlighted in a respectful and thoughtful video.

03:10.700 --> 03:12.700
But hey, how about the Earth's magnetic field? This is slow, folks.

03:12.700 --> 03:15.700
If we extrapolate backwards, just as 20,000 years ago!

03:15.700 --> 03:16.700
How long?

03:16.700 --> 03:17.700
20,000 years ago!

03:17.700 --> 03:18.700
20 million?

03:18.700 --> 03:19.700
Not 20 million!

03:19.700 --> 03:20.700
20 billion?

03:20.700 --> 03:21.700
Not 20 billion.

03:21.700 --> 03:24.700
20,000 years ago the heat produced by the magnetic field would have liquefied the Earth!

03:24.700 --> 03:25.700
Get the fuck out of here!

03:25.700 --> 03:26.700
Get the fuck out of here!

03:26.700 --> 03:27.700
20,000 years ago!

03:27.700 --> 03:30.700
And a million years ago, folks, get this, the magnetic field would have been so strong,

03:30.700 --> 03:31.700
it would have vaporised our planet!

03:31.700 --> 03:32.700
Vaporised the planet?

03:32.700 --> 03:34.700
Get the fuck out of here!

03:34.700 --> 03:37.700
Then in September I'd open it up for voting.

03:37.700 --> 03:41.700
On the feast day of St Jude Thaddeus, the patron saint of lost causes,

03:41.700 --> 03:46.700
we'd hold a star-studded gala from the St Jude Thaddeus Theatre in beautiful downtown

03:46.700 --> 03:49.700
Wagga Wagga and I'd announce the winner.

03:49.700 --> 03:54.700
Well, what would happen as that poor dinosaur was breathing heavily in and out through those

03:54.700 --> 03:55.700
very narrow nostrils?

03:55.700 --> 03:59.700
Well, I'll tell you what would happen is the nostrils would catch on fire.

04:06.700 --> 04:10.700
But things will have to be a little different from next year given my time constraints.

04:10.700 --> 04:15.700
There won't be a monthly look at the nominees, there'll just be one video a year.

04:15.700 --> 04:19.700
And that means I can't open it up for voting, sorry.

04:19.700 --> 04:23.700
But you can, of course, post your opinions in the comments section.

04:23.700 --> 04:28.700
I'll gather the best of the nominees, make a video on them, and then announce my choice

04:28.700 --> 04:31.700
on, of course, October 28th.

04:31.700 --> 04:37.700
Now, even though I'm clearly being very respectful of these creationist ideas, there are those

04:37.700 --> 04:43.700
who say the Golden Crocoduck is just frivolously and gratuitously poking fun at people of faith

04:43.700 --> 04:46.700
for the purpose of cheap and easy laughs.

04:46.700 --> 04:49.700
So get those nominations in now.

04:49.700 --> 04:53.700
They close at the end of March because then I have to put together the awards in time

04:53.700 --> 04:56.700
for October 28th, 2023.

04:56.700 --> 04:58.700
Now, a few ground rules.

04:58.700 --> 05:00.700
Videos only, please.

05:00.700 --> 05:05.700
If YouTube won't let you add the link, just give the title of the video, the name of the

05:05.700 --> 05:07.700
channel, and the host website.

05:07.700 --> 05:08.700
I'll find it.

05:08.700 --> 05:12.700
And remember, there are other video hosts with even weirder religious channels.

05:12.700 --> 05:16.700
Sorry, I mean, even more interesting creationist theories.

05:16.700 --> 05:20.700
Secondly, please make sure it is a breach of the Ninth Commandment.

05:20.700 --> 05:26.700
That means something that is verifiably false, not just an opinion or a belief.

05:26.700 --> 05:31.700
For example, in the previous series of Golden Crocoduck awards, I accepted claims from participants

05:31.700 --> 05:37.700
at the Santa Convention that the Earth doesn't spin on the basis that this has been disproved

05:37.700 --> 05:38.700
by basic physics.

05:38.700 --> 05:40.700
It is not moving.

05:40.700 --> 05:44.700
And claims that the only way rocks can fold is if they're newly laid.

05:44.700 --> 05:48.700
Strata will not remain plastic for millions of years so that they can bend.

05:48.700 --> 05:54.700
The only way the strata could have been bent is because they were still plastic, still soft and moist

05:54.700 --> 05:56.700
when they were bent.

05:56.700 --> 06:02.700
Tickers that's been disproved by laboratory experiments of hard, dry rocks under pressure.

06:02.700 --> 06:08.700
But I didn't accept as a nomination the claim that the nostrils of dinosaurs caught fire

06:08.700 --> 06:10.700
because they breathed harder.

06:10.700 --> 06:13.700
However laughable that may sound, it's a belief.

06:13.700 --> 06:19.700
Still, I'm glad someone nominated it anyway because later in the nominated video I did find a breach

06:19.700 --> 06:21.700
of the Ninth Commandment.

06:21.700 --> 06:25.700
Richard Kent claimed that this picture was drawn by pygmies in West Africa

06:25.700 --> 06:28.700
as evidence of the existence of modern-day dinosaurs.

06:28.700 --> 06:36.700
And there's a drawing which they made of the makale mobembe and it looks to me very much like a dinosaur.

06:36.700 --> 06:41.700
And when I searched for the image online, I found that it had come from a children's book

06:41.700 --> 06:46.700
and the artist was not a Congo pygmy who had seen this alleged dinosaur.

06:46.700 --> 06:53.700
And he was a creationist trying to persuade young, fertile minds that dinosaurs still exist.

06:53.700 --> 06:59.700
That's what I meant by verifiable evidence, not just something we deem to be wrong.

06:59.700 --> 07:04.700
Now this debunking of the picture may be rather dull and factual, but it gave me a great opportunity

07:04.700 --> 07:11.700
to air the fiery dinosaur-nostril theory which I knew my subscribers badly needed to hear.

07:11.700 --> 07:13.700
Likewise, this one.

07:13.700 --> 07:19.700
This is a replica of an oviraptor egg nest. This is what the dinosaurs want to do.

07:19.700 --> 07:25.700
I rejected a nomination of Ian Juby for claiming that an oviraptor laid eggs in straight lines

07:25.700 --> 07:28.700
instead of circles because it was running from a flood.

07:28.700 --> 07:30.700
Ian, that's incredible!

07:30.700 --> 07:33.700
And he's welcome to hold that incredible belief.

07:33.700 --> 07:36.700
The breach of the Ninth Commandment came when he gave his source.

07:36.700 --> 07:43.700
All of this is centralized to run an article by Barnhart in the Creation Research Society quarterly magazine.

07:43.700 --> 07:50.700
I discovered that the magazine based its information on a book which based its information on a scientific paper.

07:50.700 --> 07:54.700
And it turned out the straight line's nest wasn't made by an oviraptor at all.

07:54.700 --> 08:00.700
It was made by a Troodon which lived on the opposite side of the Cretaceous world.

08:00.700 --> 08:03.700
So the oviraptor didn't change its egg-laying practice,

08:03.700 --> 08:08.700
and there's nothing at all unusual about how the Troodon laid its eggs.

08:08.700 --> 08:14.700
Maybe Juby was so excited at seeing the pictures that he forgot to read the text.

08:14.700 --> 08:18.700
Well, Eric Hovind apparently beat me up by a few votes, and YouTuber Potholer54,

08:18.700 --> 08:23.700
who organizes the awards, once again has criticized and accused out of his own sheer ignorance.

08:23.700 --> 08:26.700
Well, I have no problem admitting I'm ignorant.

08:26.700 --> 08:31.700
I had no idea, for example, about the nest-laying habits of the oviraptor.

08:31.700 --> 08:37.700
But I looked it up, using Juby's own source, and that's how I know he got it wrong,

08:37.700 --> 08:40.700
despite my ignorance of the subject.

08:40.700 --> 08:42.700
It's right there in black and white.

08:42.700 --> 08:46.700
He didn't bother to read his own sources. I did.

08:46.700 --> 08:52.700
That's why, if your nominee gives a source, then any claim they make can be verifiably disproved,

08:52.700 --> 08:55.700
and the nomination is much more likely to succeed.

08:55.700 --> 08:59.700
And it helps when they put their own source right there on the screen themselves,

08:59.700 --> 09:03.700
and change it to fit their beliefs as they're reading it.

09:03.700 --> 09:09.700
Now, consider. They just stated, hardened shortly after they died.

09:09.700 --> 09:14.700
Or here's Billy Crone, claiming scientists have no explanation for how polystrat trees form.

09:14.700 --> 09:17.700
Here's an upright tree, petrified tree. This guy was working in the mine,

09:17.700 --> 09:21.700
and he came across a tree going through several layers of rock. They have no answer for this one.

09:21.700 --> 09:28.700
But when I tracked down the illustration he uses, I found it came from a book published in 1868

09:28.700 --> 09:34.700
that explains exactly how polystrat trees form in the very same chapter.

09:34.700 --> 09:41.700
Once again, an example of a creationist who copies the pictures, but forgets to read the text.

09:41.700 --> 09:44.700
Of course, the smart ones are careful not to give a source,

09:44.700 --> 09:48.700
so that you can't check the veracity of their information.

09:48.700 --> 09:50.700
Here's a smart one.

09:50.700 --> 09:56.700
Honestly, I don't trust radiometric and carbon dating at all.

09:56.700 --> 10:01.700
But bear with me here. Here's a little article from an article.

10:01.700 --> 10:07.700
Unfortunately, this guy wasn't quite smart enough to know that if he reads out his mystery source,

10:07.700 --> 10:12.700
anyone can Google the chunks of text and find the creationist website

10:12.700 --> 10:16.700
where he got his scientific information from.

10:16.700 --> 10:20.700
Next, please post nominees on this comment section.

10:20.700 --> 10:27.700
Yes, I will see it in my daily feed. If you post it on another video forum, it'll probably be overlooked.

10:27.700 --> 10:31.700
The great thing about keeping everything on this video comment section

10:31.700 --> 10:34.700
is that people can discuss the candidates here.

10:34.700 --> 10:37.700
Finally, it's no good just posting a link.

10:37.700 --> 10:42.700
I get sent dozens of links every week without any explanation as to what they are,

10:42.700 --> 10:44.700
why I'm supposed to click on them,

10:44.700 --> 10:49.700
or where I'm supposed to find whatever information or offending material they contain.

10:49.700 --> 10:53.700
And YouTube usually deletes links automatically anyway.

10:53.700 --> 10:56.700
So along with the title of the video and the name of the channel,

10:56.700 --> 11:03.700
please tell me what the breach of the ninth commandment is and at what time stamp I can find it.

11:03.700 --> 11:06.700
Your chances of getting a nomination will be greatly enhanced

11:06.700 --> 11:12.700
if the creationist's claim is not only ludicrously stupid, but also widely believed.

11:12.700 --> 11:18.700
So this claim was stupid enough to get through, even though it didn't get that many hits.

11:20.700 --> 11:27.700
I'm going to make a scientific experiment today illustrating what would happen

11:27.700 --> 11:32.700
with the Colorado River for billions of years.

11:32.700 --> 11:39.700
This claim about thermodynamics is widely believed, even though it isn't particularly funny.

11:39.700 --> 11:45.700
And it doesn't matter what the religion is, as long as it uses the Ten Commandments as its basic creed.

11:45.700 --> 11:49.700
Al-Dabang any old crap that fits the Golden Crocoduck criteria?

11:49.700 --> 11:57.700
Who can forget the Iraqi astronomer who thought the earth was flat and the sun is tiny because the Quran says so?

11:57.700 --> 11:59.700
And whatever this is.

12:03.700 --> 12:07.700
This has nothing to do with personal religious belief.

12:07.700 --> 12:16.700
If you practice Christianity, Islam or Judaism or worship any of the millions of deities, saints and spirits out there, no problem.

12:16.700 --> 12:24.700
Just don't start publicly preaching misinformation about science in order to get other people to believe whatever you believe.

12:24.700 --> 12:29.700
If you do, then expect to be challenged as publicly as you evangelise.

12:30.700 --> 12:36.700
Now, as with past practice, I will withdraw any nominee who admits they were wrong or made a mistake.

12:36.700 --> 12:39.700
And that has happened a couple of times.

12:39.700 --> 12:47.700
But it's rare, because creationists seem to have an obsessional, almost pathological inability to admit a single mistake.

12:47.700 --> 12:54.700
I find the same thing with people who disbelieve other aspects of science, from climate change to plate tectonics.

12:54.700 --> 13:01.700
It seems that even the tiniest admission of error will bring their entire belief system crashing down.

13:01.700 --> 13:09.700
Which is the complete opposite of science, where the discovery and correction of errors is part of how science advances.

13:09.700 --> 13:13.700
Come on guys, we all make mistakes, myself included.

13:13.700 --> 13:18.700
Would you rather breach one of your own most sacred commandments than admit you're wrong?

13:18.700 --> 13:21.700
The answer, it seems, is yes.

13:21.700 --> 13:30.700
I was in correspondence with this guy who was nominated for claiming that the shaft of a hammer, known as the London artifact, had turned to coal.

13:30.700 --> 13:36.700
I pointed out that a photo of the hammer in his own videos clearly showed that it hadn't.

13:36.700 --> 13:38.700
Which he didn't dispute.

13:38.700 --> 13:44.700
I offered to give him a chance to admit the error and withdraw his claim, but he simply couldn't bring himself to do that.

13:44.700 --> 13:57.700
And this YouTuber even admitted that his translation of Hitler, proclaiming Darwinism to be the state religion and announcing a plan to exterminate creationists, was completely made up.

13:57.700 --> 14:03.700
He even lied to other creationists who thought the quotes were real and wanted to use them in their own videos.

14:03.700 --> 14:07.700
And you wonder how crap gets passed round the internet.

14:07.700 --> 14:12.700
So it's not always a case of self-delusion or confirmation bias.

14:12.700 --> 14:19.700
A lot of these people are quite happily prepared to lie to further the spread of their own personal beliefs.

14:19.700 --> 14:24.700
I find it highly ironic that they would call upon the laws of a god whom they contend does not even exist.

14:24.700 --> 14:30.700
But you do, Ian. Get it? You are the ones claiming to live by these rules.

14:30.700 --> 14:38.700
Yet you're prepared to breach your own most sacred commandments in order to get people to believe in the very commandments you're breaking.

14:38.700 --> 14:40.700
Now that's irony.

14:40.700 --> 14:47.700
And that sound is the concept of irony and hypocrisy going right over Ian Juby's head.

14:47.700 --> 14:54.700
That's OK. We'll keep showing up your hypocrisy and you keep trying to figure out if the Sun orbits the Earth.

14:54.700 --> 14:58.700
Well, yeah. Because geocentrism would...

14:58.700 --> 15:01.700
I could be wrong on this.

15:01.700 --> 15:03.700
Wait. Don't go yet.

15:03.700 --> 15:10.700
Here's an update from the charity you guys have been supporting, which I ask you to do in lieu of sending me money.

15:10.700 --> 15:20.700
Contributions to date are over $266,000, and I can't tell you how much that's helped expand the work of this charity.

15:20.700 --> 15:29.700
It's an innovative scheme to provide affordable healthcare to people living near national parks in exchange for a verifiable cessation of logging.

15:29.700 --> 15:34.700
The result is better health and a better quality environment.

15:34.700 --> 15:39.700
Thanks to your donations, they've expanded into other countries and are getting great results.

15:39.700 --> 15:45.700
They've been written up in scientific studies and won prestigious awards.

15:45.700 --> 15:52.700
I know many of you have put your hands in your pockets and some have even set up recurring contributions, which is great.

15:52.700 --> 15:55.700
Thank you. Thank you.

15:55.700 --> 16:03.700
So if you're watching my videos for free, even if you get some strange enjoyment from hating them, please consider donating.

16:03.700 --> 16:09.700
Knowing that this channel is doing some good in the world really does keep me going. Thanks.
