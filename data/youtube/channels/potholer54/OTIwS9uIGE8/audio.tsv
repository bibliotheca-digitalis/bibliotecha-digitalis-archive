0	5280	Well, hello there. Welcome to my video message.
5280	9880	I know, this guy looks like he's just kidnapped your kid and he's about to give you his ransom
9880	15860	demands. In fact, he's a former nominee for the coveted Golden Crocoduck. And since today
15860	20780	is the Feast of St Jude Thaddeus, the painter and saint of lost causes, I thought it was
20780	24900	a good time to make an announcement about that award.
24900	30340	If anyone doesn't know what the coveted Golden Crocoduck is, it was awarded, well, let's
30340	32820	let creationist Ian Juby explain.
32820	38020	Now this award is given out to those creationists they deem to have broken the 9th commandment.
38020	44660	Well, almost right. It was for those creationists who verifiably breached the 9th commandment,
44660	47700	and there were always plenty of candidates to choose from.
47700	50700	Not one transitional form has been found.
50700	52700	There are no transitional forms.
52700	58700	Carbon dating indicated live snails had died 27,000 years before.
58700	63700	Shells from living snails were carbon dated at 27,000 years old.
63700	69700	Mammoths have been found with food still in their mouths, still in their gut, that is
69700	71700	tropical vegetation.
71700	76700	The evolutionary textbook, you'll still find this, they're claiming that whales evolved
76700	78700	legs and became cows.
78700	81700	It's the stupidest thing I've ever heard.
81700	85700	We ought to see cats, we ought to see dogs, and we ought to see cogs and dats.
85700	89700	And all through the fossil record and life, we don't find one of these.
89700	90700	A crocoduck.
90700	96700	Over the years, many people have been lobbying for a return of the Golden Crocoduck, so I've
96700	102700	listened to the pleas and decided, yes, I will bring it back, wait till I've finished,
102700	105700	but in a more limited form.
105700	109700	Under the old system, anyone could nominate a creationist of their choice, and every month
109700	114700	I'd go through the nominees and fact check the information, in a very respectful way,
114700	120700	of course, so as not to mock or belittle the sincerity of the creationists promoting these theories.
120700	124700	The banana and the hand are perfectly made one for the other.
124700	126700	So God has placed a tab at the top.
126700	130700	When you pull the tab, the contents don't squirt in your face.
130700	133700	Notice how gracefully it sits over the human hand.
133700	135700	Notice it has a point at the top for ease of entry.
135700	138700	It's just the right shape for the human mouth.
138700	139700	Okay, that's enough, Ray.
139700	141700	I'm getting palpitations.
141700	143700	So here's the thing about the Golden Crocoduck.
143700	150700	As you know, I tried very hard to not make it amusing or somehow belittling of these creationist ideas.
150700	156700	I'm less interested in whether Ray Comfort is holding something God made that fits into his hand,
156700	161700	designed for ease of entry into someone's mouth without squirting in their face.
161700	162700	What?
162700	163700	Oh, come on.
163700	165700	I'm talking about his banana.
165700	167700	I'm trying to make a serious point here.
167700	172700	I'm less interested in that than the claim that God made the banana just like this,
172700	179700	rather than whether the modern banana was cultivated by humans from a small, wild, seed-filled fruit.
179700	186700	If a claim turned out to be false, and therefore a breach of one of the creationists' own most sacred commandments,
186700	190700	it got highlighted in a respectful and thoughtful video.
190700	192700	But hey, how about the Earth's magnetic field? This is slow, folks.
192700	195700	If we extrapolate backwards, just as 20,000 years ago!
195700	196700	How long?
196700	197700	20,000 years ago!
197700	198700	20 million?
198700	199700	Not 20 million!
199700	200700	20 billion?
200700	201700	Not 20 billion.
201700	204700	20,000 years ago the heat produced by the magnetic field would have liquefied the Earth!
204700	205700	Get the fuck out of here!
205700	206700	Get the fuck out of here!
206700	207700	20,000 years ago!
207700	210700	And a million years ago, folks, get this, the magnetic field would have been so strong,
210700	211700	it would have vaporised our planet!
211700	212700	Vaporised the planet?
212700	214700	Get the fuck out of here!
214700	217700	Then in September I'd open it up for voting.
217700	221700	On the feast day of St Jude Thaddeus, the patron saint of lost causes,
221700	226700	we'd hold a star-studded gala from the St Jude Thaddeus Theatre in beautiful downtown
226700	229700	Wagga Wagga and I'd announce the winner.
229700	234700	Well, what would happen as that poor dinosaur was breathing heavily in and out through those
234700	235700	very narrow nostrils?
235700	239700	Well, I'll tell you what would happen is the nostrils would catch on fire.
246700	250700	But things will have to be a little different from next year given my time constraints.
250700	255700	There won't be a monthly look at the nominees, there'll just be one video a year.
255700	259700	And that means I can't open it up for voting, sorry.
259700	263700	But you can, of course, post your opinions in the comments section.
263700	268700	I'll gather the best of the nominees, make a video on them, and then announce my choice
268700	271700	on, of course, October 28th.
271700	277700	Now, even though I'm clearly being very respectful of these creationist ideas, there are those
277700	283700	who say the Golden Crocoduck is just frivolously and gratuitously poking fun at people of faith
283700	286700	for the purpose of cheap and easy laughs.
286700	289700	So get those nominations in now.
289700	293700	They close at the end of March because then I have to put together the awards in time
293700	296700	for October 28th, 2023.
296700	298700	Now, a few ground rules.
298700	300700	Videos only, please.
300700	305700	If YouTube won't let you add the link, just give the title of the video, the name of the
305700	307700	channel, and the host website.
307700	308700	I'll find it.
308700	312700	And remember, there are other video hosts with even weirder religious channels.
312700	316700	Sorry, I mean, even more interesting creationist theories.
316700	320700	Secondly, please make sure it is a breach of the Ninth Commandment.
320700	326700	That means something that is verifiably false, not just an opinion or a belief.
326700	331700	For example, in the previous series of Golden Crocoduck awards, I accepted claims from participants
331700	337700	at the Santa Convention that the Earth doesn't spin on the basis that this has been disproved
337700	338700	by basic physics.
338700	340700	It is not moving.
340700	344700	And claims that the only way rocks can fold is if they're newly laid.
344700	348700	Strata will not remain plastic for millions of years so that they can bend.
348700	354700	The only way the strata could have been bent is because they were still plastic, still soft and moist
354700	356700	when they were bent.
356700	362700	Tickers that's been disproved by laboratory experiments of hard, dry rocks under pressure.
362700	368700	But I didn't accept as a nomination the claim that the nostrils of dinosaurs caught fire
368700	370700	because they breathed harder.
370700	373700	However laughable that may sound, it's a belief.
373700	379700	Still, I'm glad someone nominated it anyway because later in the nominated video I did find a breach
379700	381700	of the Ninth Commandment.
381700	385700	Richard Kent claimed that this picture was drawn by pygmies in West Africa
385700	388700	as evidence of the existence of modern-day dinosaurs.
388700	396700	And there's a drawing which they made of the makale mobembe and it looks to me very much like a dinosaur.
396700	401700	And when I searched for the image online, I found that it had come from a children's book
401700	406700	and the artist was not a Congo pygmy who had seen this alleged dinosaur.
406700	413700	And he was a creationist trying to persuade young, fertile minds that dinosaurs still exist.
413700	419700	That's what I meant by verifiable evidence, not just something we deem to be wrong.
419700	424700	Now this debunking of the picture may be rather dull and factual, but it gave me a great opportunity
424700	431700	to air the fiery dinosaur-nostril theory which I knew my subscribers badly needed to hear.
431700	433700	Likewise, this one.
433700	439700	This is a replica of an oviraptor egg nest. This is what the dinosaurs want to do.
439700	445700	I rejected a nomination of Ian Juby for claiming that an oviraptor laid eggs in straight lines
445700	448700	instead of circles because it was running from a flood.
448700	450700	Ian, that's incredible!
450700	453700	And he's welcome to hold that incredible belief.
453700	456700	The breach of the Ninth Commandment came when he gave his source.
456700	463700	All of this is centralized to run an article by Barnhart in the Creation Research Society quarterly magazine.
463700	470700	I discovered that the magazine based its information on a book which based its information on a scientific paper.
470700	474700	And it turned out the straight line's nest wasn't made by an oviraptor at all.
474700	480700	It was made by a Troodon which lived on the opposite side of the Cretaceous world.
480700	483700	So the oviraptor didn't change its egg-laying practice,
483700	488700	and there's nothing at all unusual about how the Troodon laid its eggs.
488700	494700	Maybe Juby was so excited at seeing the pictures that he forgot to read the text.
494700	498700	Well, Eric Hovind apparently beat me up by a few votes, and YouTuber Potholer54,
498700	503700	who organizes the awards, once again has criticized and accused out of his own sheer ignorance.
503700	506700	Well, I have no problem admitting I'm ignorant.
506700	511700	I had no idea, for example, about the nest-laying habits of the oviraptor.
511700	517700	But I looked it up, using Juby's own source, and that's how I know he got it wrong,
517700	520700	despite my ignorance of the subject.
520700	522700	It's right there in black and white.
522700	526700	He didn't bother to read his own sources. I did.
526700	532700	That's why, if your nominee gives a source, then any claim they make can be verifiably disproved,
532700	535700	and the nomination is much more likely to succeed.
535700	539700	And it helps when they put their own source right there on the screen themselves,
539700	543700	and change it to fit their beliefs as they're reading it.
543700	549700	Now, consider. They just stated, hardened shortly after they died.
549700	554700	Or here's Billy Crone, claiming scientists have no explanation for how polystrat trees form.
554700	557700	Here's an upright tree, petrified tree. This guy was working in the mine,
557700	561700	and he came across a tree going through several layers of rock. They have no answer for this one.
561700	568700	But when I tracked down the illustration he uses, I found it came from a book published in 1868
568700	574700	that explains exactly how polystrat trees form in the very same chapter.
574700	581700	Once again, an example of a creationist who copies the pictures, but forgets to read the text.
581700	584700	Of course, the smart ones are careful not to give a source,
584700	588700	so that you can't check the veracity of their information.
588700	590700	Here's a smart one.
590700	596700	Honestly, I don't trust radiometric and carbon dating at all.
596700	601700	But bear with me here. Here's a little article from an article.
601700	607700	Unfortunately, this guy wasn't quite smart enough to know that if he reads out his mystery source,
607700	612700	anyone can Google the chunks of text and find the creationist website
612700	616700	where he got his scientific information from.
616700	620700	Next, please post nominees on this comment section.
620700	627700	Yes, I will see it in my daily feed. If you post it on another video forum, it'll probably be overlooked.
627700	631700	The great thing about keeping everything on this video comment section
631700	634700	is that people can discuss the candidates here.
634700	637700	Finally, it's no good just posting a link.
637700	642700	I get sent dozens of links every week without any explanation as to what they are,
642700	644700	why I'm supposed to click on them,
644700	649700	or where I'm supposed to find whatever information or offending material they contain.
649700	653700	And YouTube usually deletes links automatically anyway.
653700	656700	So along with the title of the video and the name of the channel,
656700	663700	please tell me what the breach of the ninth commandment is and at what time stamp I can find it.
663700	666700	Your chances of getting a nomination will be greatly enhanced
666700	672700	if the creationist's claim is not only ludicrously stupid, but also widely believed.
672700	678700	So this claim was stupid enough to get through, even though it didn't get that many hits.
680700	687700	I'm going to make a scientific experiment today illustrating what would happen
687700	692700	with the Colorado River for billions of years.
692700	699700	This claim about thermodynamics is widely believed, even though it isn't particularly funny.
699700	705700	And it doesn't matter what the religion is, as long as it uses the Ten Commandments as its basic creed.
705700	709700	Al-Dabang any old crap that fits the Golden Crocoduck criteria?
709700	717700	Who can forget the Iraqi astronomer who thought the earth was flat and the sun is tiny because the Quran says so?
717700	719700	And whatever this is.
723700	727700	This has nothing to do with personal religious belief.
727700	736700	If you practice Christianity, Islam or Judaism or worship any of the millions of deities, saints and spirits out there, no problem.
736700	744700	Just don't start publicly preaching misinformation about science in order to get other people to believe whatever you believe.
744700	749700	If you do, then expect to be challenged as publicly as you evangelise.
750700	756700	Now, as with past practice, I will withdraw any nominee who admits they were wrong or made a mistake.
756700	759700	And that has happened a couple of times.
759700	767700	But it's rare, because creationists seem to have an obsessional, almost pathological inability to admit a single mistake.
767700	774700	I find the same thing with people who disbelieve other aspects of science, from climate change to plate tectonics.
774700	781700	It seems that even the tiniest admission of error will bring their entire belief system crashing down.
781700	789700	Which is the complete opposite of science, where the discovery and correction of errors is part of how science advances.
789700	793700	Come on guys, we all make mistakes, myself included.
793700	798700	Would you rather breach one of your own most sacred commandments than admit you're wrong?
798700	801700	The answer, it seems, is yes.
801700	810700	I was in correspondence with this guy who was nominated for claiming that the shaft of a hammer, known as the London artifact, had turned to coal.
810700	816700	I pointed out that a photo of the hammer in his own videos clearly showed that it hadn't.
816700	818700	Which he didn't dispute.
818700	824700	I offered to give him a chance to admit the error and withdraw his claim, but he simply couldn't bring himself to do that.
824700	837700	And this YouTuber even admitted that his translation of Hitler, proclaiming Darwinism to be the state religion and announcing a plan to exterminate creationists, was completely made up.
837700	843700	He even lied to other creationists who thought the quotes were real and wanted to use them in their own videos.
843700	847700	And you wonder how crap gets passed round the internet.
847700	852700	So it's not always a case of self-delusion or confirmation bias.
852700	859700	A lot of these people are quite happily prepared to lie to further the spread of their own personal beliefs.
859700	864700	I find it highly ironic that they would call upon the laws of a god whom they contend does not even exist.
864700	870700	But you do, Ian. Get it? You are the ones claiming to live by these rules.
870700	878700	Yet you're prepared to breach your own most sacred commandments in order to get people to believe in the very commandments you're breaking.
878700	880700	Now that's irony.
880700	887700	And that sound is the concept of irony and hypocrisy going right over Ian Juby's head.
887700	894700	That's OK. We'll keep showing up your hypocrisy and you keep trying to figure out if the Sun orbits the Earth.
894700	898700	Well, yeah. Because geocentrism would...
898700	901700	I could be wrong on this.
901700	903700	Wait. Don't go yet.
903700	910700	Here's an update from the charity you guys have been supporting, which I ask you to do in lieu of sending me money.
910700	920700	Contributions to date are over $266,000, and I can't tell you how much that's helped expand the work of this charity.
920700	929700	It's an innovative scheme to provide affordable healthcare to people living near national parks in exchange for a verifiable cessation of logging.
929700	934700	The result is better health and a better quality environment.
934700	939700	Thanks to your donations, they've expanded into other countries and are getting great results.
939700	945700	They've been written up in scientific studies and won prestigious awards.
945700	952700	I know many of you have put your hands in your pockets and some have even set up recurring contributions, which is great.
952700	955700	Thank you. Thank you.
955700	963700	So if you're watching my videos for free, even if you get some strange enjoyment from hating them, please consider donating.
963700	969700	Knowing that this channel is doing some good in the world really does keep me going. Thanks.
