1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,280
Well, hello there. Welcome to my video message.

2
00:00:05,280 --> 00:00:09,880
I know, this guy looks like he's just kidnapped your kid and he's about to give you his ransom

3
00:00:09,880 --> 00:00:15,860
demands. In fact, he's a former nominee for the coveted Golden Crocoduck. And since today

4
00:00:15,860 --> 00:00:20,780
is the Feast of St Jude Thaddeus, the painter and saint of lost causes, I thought it was

5
00:00:20,780 --> 00:00:24,900
a good time to make an announcement about that award.

6
00:00:24,900 --> 00:00:30,340
If anyone doesn't know what the coveted Golden Crocoduck is, it was awarded, well, let's

7
00:00:30,340 --> 00:00:32,820
let creationist Ian Juby explain.

8
00:00:32,820 --> 00:00:38,020
Now this award is given out to those creationists they deem to have broken the 9th commandment.

9
00:00:38,020 --> 00:00:44,660
Well, almost right. It was for those creationists who verifiably breached the 9th commandment,

10
00:00:44,660 --> 00:00:47,700
and there were always plenty of candidates to choose from.

11
00:00:47,700 --> 00:00:50,700
Not one transitional form has been found.

12
00:00:50,700 --> 00:00:52,700
There are no transitional forms.

13
00:00:52,700 --> 00:00:58,700
Carbon dating indicated live snails had died 27,000 years before.

14
00:00:58,700 --> 00:01:03,700
Shells from living snails were carbon dated at 27,000 years old.

15
00:01:03,700 --> 00:01:09,700
Mammoths have been found with food still in their mouths, still in their gut, that is

16
00:01:09,700 --> 00:01:11,700
tropical vegetation.

17
00:01:11,700 --> 00:01:16,700
The evolutionary textbook, you'll still find this, they're claiming that whales evolved

18
00:01:16,700 --> 00:01:18,700
legs and became cows.

19
00:01:18,700 --> 00:01:21,700
It's the stupidest thing I've ever heard.

20
00:01:21,700 --> 00:01:25,700
We ought to see cats, we ought to see dogs, and we ought to see cogs and dats.

21
00:01:25,700 --> 00:01:29,700
And all through the fossil record and life, we don't find one of these.

22
00:01:29,700 --> 00:01:30,700
A crocoduck.

23
00:01:30,700 --> 00:01:36,700
Over the years, many people have been lobbying for a return of the Golden Crocoduck, so I've

24
00:01:36,700 --> 00:01:42,700
listened to the pleas and decided, yes, I will bring it back, wait till I've finished,

25
00:01:42,700 --> 00:01:45,700
but in a more limited form.

26
00:01:45,700 --> 00:01:49,700
Under the old system, anyone could nominate a creationist of their choice, and every month

27
00:01:49,700 --> 00:01:54,700
I'd go through the nominees and fact check the information, in a very respectful way,

28
00:01:54,700 --> 00:02:00,700
of course, so as not to mock or belittle the sincerity of the creationists promoting these theories.

29
00:02:00,700 --> 00:02:04,700
The banana and the hand are perfectly made one for the other.

30
00:02:04,700 --> 00:02:06,700
So God has placed a tab at the top.

31
00:02:06,700 --> 00:02:10,700
When you pull the tab, the contents don't squirt in your face.

32
00:02:10,700 --> 00:02:13,700
Notice how gracefully it sits over the human hand.

33
00:02:13,700 --> 00:02:15,700
Notice it has a point at the top for ease of entry.

34
00:02:15,700 --> 00:02:18,700
It's just the right shape for the human mouth.

35
00:02:18,700 --> 00:02:19,700
Okay, that's enough, Ray.

36
00:02:19,700 --> 00:02:21,700
I'm getting palpitations.

37
00:02:21,700 --> 00:02:23,700
So here's the thing about the Golden Crocoduck.

38
00:02:23,700 --> 00:02:30,700
As you know, I tried very hard to not make it amusing or somehow belittling of these creationist ideas.

39
00:02:30,700 --> 00:02:36,700
I'm less interested in whether Ray Comfort is holding something God made that fits into his hand,

40
00:02:36,700 --> 00:02:41,700
designed for ease of entry into someone's mouth without squirting in their face.

41
00:02:41,700 --> 00:02:42,700
What?

42
00:02:42,700 --> 00:02:43,700
Oh, come on.

43
00:02:43,700 --> 00:02:45,700
I'm talking about his banana.

44
00:02:45,700 --> 00:02:47,700
I'm trying to make a serious point here.

45
00:02:47,700 --> 00:02:52,700
I'm less interested in that than the claim that God made the banana just like this,

46
00:02:52,700 --> 00:02:59,700
rather than whether the modern banana was cultivated by humans from a small, wild, seed-filled fruit.

47
00:02:59,700 --> 00:03:06,700
If a claim turned out to be false, and therefore a breach of one of the creationists' own most sacred commandments,

48
00:03:06,700 --> 00:03:10,700
it got highlighted in a respectful and thoughtful video.

49
00:03:10,700 --> 00:03:12,700
But hey, how about the Earth's magnetic field? This is slow, folks.

50
00:03:12,700 --> 00:03:15,700
If we extrapolate backwards, just as 20,000 years ago!

51
00:03:15,700 --> 00:03:16,700
How long?

52
00:03:16,700 --> 00:03:17,700
20,000 years ago!

53
00:03:17,700 --> 00:03:18,700
20 million?

54
00:03:18,700 --> 00:03:19,700
Not 20 million!

55
00:03:19,700 --> 00:03:20,700
20 billion?

56
00:03:20,700 --> 00:03:21,700
Not 20 billion.

57
00:03:21,700 --> 00:03:24,700
20,000 years ago the heat produced by the magnetic field would have liquefied the Earth!

58
00:03:24,700 --> 00:03:25,700
Get the fuck out of here!

59
00:03:25,700 --> 00:03:26,700
Get the fuck out of here!

60
00:03:26,700 --> 00:03:27,700
20,000 years ago!

61
00:03:27,700 --> 00:03:30,700
And a million years ago, folks, get this, the magnetic field would have been so strong,

62
00:03:30,700 --> 00:03:31,700
it would have vaporised our planet!

63
00:03:31,700 --> 00:03:32,700
Vaporised the planet?

64
00:03:32,700 --> 00:03:34,700
Get the fuck out of here!

65
00:03:34,700 --> 00:03:37,700
Then in September I'd open it up for voting.

66
00:03:37,700 --> 00:03:41,700
On the feast day of St Jude Thaddeus, the patron saint of lost causes,

67
00:03:41,700 --> 00:03:46,700
we'd hold a star-studded gala from the St Jude Thaddeus Theatre in beautiful downtown

68
00:03:46,700 --> 00:03:49,700
Wagga Wagga and I'd announce the winner.

69
00:03:49,700 --> 00:03:54,700
Well, what would happen as that poor dinosaur was breathing heavily in and out through those

70
00:03:54,700 --> 00:03:55,700
very narrow nostrils?

71
00:03:55,700 --> 00:03:59,700
Well, I'll tell you what would happen is the nostrils would catch on fire.

72
00:04:06,700 --> 00:04:10,700
But things will have to be a little different from next year given my time constraints.

73
00:04:10,700 --> 00:04:15,700
There won't be a monthly look at the nominees, there'll just be one video a year.

74
00:04:15,700 --> 00:04:19,700
And that means I can't open it up for voting, sorry.

75
00:04:19,700 --> 00:04:23,700
But you can, of course, post your opinions in the comments section.

76
00:04:23,700 --> 00:04:28,700
I'll gather the best of the nominees, make a video on them, and then announce my choice

77
00:04:28,700 --> 00:04:31,700
on, of course, October 28th.

78
00:04:31,700 --> 00:04:37,700
Now, even though I'm clearly being very respectful of these creationist ideas, there are those

79
00:04:37,700 --> 00:04:43,700
who say the Golden Crocoduck is just frivolously and gratuitously poking fun at people of faith

80
00:04:43,700 --> 00:04:46,700
for the purpose of cheap and easy laughs.

81
00:04:46,700 --> 00:04:49,700
So get those nominations in now.

82
00:04:49,700 --> 00:04:53,700
They close at the end of March because then I have to put together the awards in time

83
00:04:53,700 --> 00:04:56,700
for October 28th, 2023.

84
00:04:56,700 --> 00:04:58,700
Now, a few ground rules.

85
00:04:58,700 --> 00:05:00,700
Videos only, please.

86
00:05:00,700 --> 00:05:05,700
If YouTube won't let you add the link, just give the title of the video, the name of the

87
00:05:05,700 --> 00:05:07,700
channel, and the host website.

88
00:05:07,700 --> 00:05:08,700
I'll find it.

89
00:05:08,700 --> 00:05:12,700
And remember, there are other video hosts with even weirder religious channels.

90
00:05:12,700 --> 00:05:16,700
Sorry, I mean, even more interesting creationist theories.

91
00:05:16,700 --> 00:05:20,700
Secondly, please make sure it is a breach of the Ninth Commandment.

92
00:05:20,700 --> 00:05:26,700
That means something that is verifiably false, not just an opinion or a belief.

93
00:05:26,700 --> 00:05:31,700
For example, in the previous series of Golden Crocoduck awards, I accepted claims from participants

94
00:05:31,700 --> 00:05:37,700
at the Santa Convention that the Earth doesn't spin on the basis that this has been disproved

95
00:05:37,700 --> 00:05:38,700
by basic physics.

96
00:05:38,700 --> 00:05:40,700
It is not moving.

97
00:05:40,700 --> 00:05:44,700
And claims that the only way rocks can fold is if they're newly laid.

98
00:05:44,700 --> 00:05:48,700
Strata will not remain plastic for millions of years so that they can bend.

99
00:05:48,700 --> 00:05:54,700
The only way the strata could have been bent is because they were still plastic, still soft and moist

100
00:05:54,700 --> 00:05:56,700
when they were bent.

101
00:05:56,700 --> 00:06:02,700
Tickers that's been disproved by laboratory experiments of hard, dry rocks under pressure.

102
00:06:02,700 --> 00:06:08,700
But I didn't accept as a nomination the claim that the nostrils of dinosaurs caught fire

103
00:06:08,700 --> 00:06:10,700
because they breathed harder.

104
00:06:10,700 --> 00:06:13,700
However laughable that may sound, it's a belief.

105
00:06:13,700 --> 00:06:19,700
Still, I'm glad someone nominated it anyway because later in the nominated video I did find a breach

106
00:06:19,700 --> 00:06:21,700
of the Ninth Commandment.

107
00:06:21,700 --> 00:06:25,700
Richard Kent claimed that this picture was drawn by pygmies in West Africa

108
00:06:25,700 --> 00:06:28,700
as evidence of the existence of modern-day dinosaurs.

109
00:06:28,700 --> 00:06:36,700
And there's a drawing which they made of the makale mobembe and it looks to me very much like a dinosaur.

110
00:06:36,700 --> 00:06:41,700
And when I searched for the image online, I found that it had come from a children's book

111
00:06:41,700 --> 00:06:46,700
and the artist was not a Congo pygmy who had seen this alleged dinosaur.

112
00:06:46,700 --> 00:06:53,700
And he was a creationist trying to persuade young, fertile minds that dinosaurs still exist.

113
00:06:53,700 --> 00:06:59,700
That's what I meant by verifiable evidence, not just something we deem to be wrong.

114
00:06:59,700 --> 00:07:04,700
Now this debunking of the picture may be rather dull and factual, but it gave me a great opportunity

115
00:07:04,700 --> 00:07:11,700
to air the fiery dinosaur-nostril theory which I knew my subscribers badly needed to hear.

116
00:07:11,700 --> 00:07:13,700
Likewise, this one.

117
00:07:13,700 --> 00:07:19,700
This is a replica of an oviraptor egg nest. This is what the dinosaurs want to do.

118
00:07:19,700 --> 00:07:25,700
I rejected a nomination of Ian Juby for claiming that an oviraptor laid eggs in straight lines

119
00:07:25,700 --> 00:07:28,700
instead of circles because it was running from a flood.

120
00:07:28,700 --> 00:07:30,700
Ian, that's incredible!

121
00:07:30,700 --> 00:07:33,700
And he's welcome to hold that incredible belief.

122
00:07:33,700 --> 00:07:36,700
The breach of the Ninth Commandment came when he gave his source.

123
00:07:36,700 --> 00:07:43,700
All of this is centralized to run an article by Barnhart in the Creation Research Society quarterly magazine.

124
00:07:43,700 --> 00:07:50,700
I discovered that the magazine based its information on a book which based its information on a scientific paper.

125
00:07:50,700 --> 00:07:54,700
And it turned out the straight line's nest wasn't made by an oviraptor at all.

126
00:07:54,700 --> 00:08:00,700
It was made by a Troodon which lived on the opposite side of the Cretaceous world.

127
00:08:00,700 --> 00:08:03,700
So the oviraptor didn't change its egg-laying practice,

128
00:08:03,700 --> 00:08:08,700
and there's nothing at all unusual about how the Troodon laid its eggs.

129
00:08:08,700 --> 00:08:14,700
Maybe Juby was so excited at seeing the pictures that he forgot to read the text.

130
00:08:14,700 --> 00:08:18,700
Well, Eric Hovind apparently beat me up by a few votes, and YouTuber Potholer54,

131
00:08:18,700 --> 00:08:23,700
who organizes the awards, once again has criticized and accused out of his own sheer ignorance.

132
00:08:23,700 --> 00:08:26,700
Well, I have no problem admitting I'm ignorant.

133
00:08:26,700 --> 00:08:31,700
I had no idea, for example, about the nest-laying habits of the oviraptor.

134
00:08:31,700 --> 00:08:37,700
But I looked it up, using Juby's own source, and that's how I know he got it wrong,

135
00:08:37,700 --> 00:08:40,700
despite my ignorance of the subject.

136
00:08:40,700 --> 00:08:42,700
It's right there in black and white.

137
00:08:42,700 --> 00:08:46,700
He didn't bother to read his own sources. I did.

138
00:08:46,700 --> 00:08:52,700
That's why, if your nominee gives a source, then any claim they make can be verifiably disproved,

139
00:08:52,700 --> 00:08:55,700
and the nomination is much more likely to succeed.

140
00:08:55,700 --> 00:08:59,700
And it helps when they put their own source right there on the screen themselves,

141
00:08:59,700 --> 00:09:03,700
and change it to fit their beliefs as they're reading it.

142
00:09:03,700 --> 00:09:09,700
Now, consider. They just stated, hardened shortly after they died.

143
00:09:09,700 --> 00:09:14,700
Or here's Billy Crone, claiming scientists have no explanation for how polystrat trees form.

144
00:09:14,700 --> 00:09:17,700
Here's an upright tree, petrified tree. This guy was working in the mine,

145
00:09:17,700 --> 00:09:21,700
and he came across a tree going through several layers of rock. They have no answer for this one.

146
00:09:21,700 --> 00:09:28,700
But when I tracked down the illustration he uses, I found it came from a book published in 1868

147
00:09:28,700 --> 00:09:34,700
that explains exactly how polystrat trees form in the very same chapter.

148
00:09:34,700 --> 00:09:41,700
Once again, an example of a creationist who copies the pictures, but forgets to read the text.

149
00:09:41,700 --> 00:09:44,700
Of course, the smart ones are careful not to give a source,

150
00:09:44,700 --> 00:09:48,700
so that you can't check the veracity of their information.

151
00:09:48,700 --> 00:09:50,700
Here's a smart one.

152
00:09:50,700 --> 00:09:56,700
Honestly, I don't trust radiometric and carbon dating at all.

153
00:09:56,700 --> 00:10:01,700
But bear with me here. Here's a little article from an article.

154
00:10:01,700 --> 00:10:07,700
Unfortunately, this guy wasn't quite smart enough to know that if he reads out his mystery source,

155
00:10:07,700 --> 00:10:12,700
anyone can Google the chunks of text and find the creationist website

156
00:10:12,700 --> 00:10:16,700
where he got his scientific information from.

157
00:10:16,700 --> 00:10:20,700
Next, please post nominees on this comment section.

158
00:10:20,700 --> 00:10:27,700
Yes, I will see it in my daily feed. If you post it on another video forum, it'll probably be overlooked.

159
00:10:27,700 --> 00:10:31,700
The great thing about keeping everything on this video comment section

160
00:10:31,700 --> 00:10:34,700
is that people can discuss the candidates here.

161
00:10:34,700 --> 00:10:37,700
Finally, it's no good just posting a link.

162
00:10:37,700 --> 00:10:42,700
I get sent dozens of links every week without any explanation as to what they are,

163
00:10:42,700 --> 00:10:44,700
why I'm supposed to click on them,

164
00:10:44,700 --> 00:10:49,700
or where I'm supposed to find whatever information or offending material they contain.

165
00:10:49,700 --> 00:10:53,700
And YouTube usually deletes links automatically anyway.

166
00:10:53,700 --> 00:10:56,700
So along with the title of the video and the name of the channel,

167
00:10:56,700 --> 00:11:03,700
please tell me what the breach of the ninth commandment is and at what time stamp I can find it.

168
00:11:03,700 --> 00:11:06,700
Your chances of getting a nomination will be greatly enhanced

169
00:11:06,700 --> 00:11:12,700
if the creationist's claim is not only ludicrously stupid, but also widely believed.

170
00:11:12,700 --> 00:11:18,700
So this claim was stupid enough to get through, even though it didn't get that many hits.

171
00:11:20,700 --> 00:11:27,700
I'm going to make a scientific experiment today illustrating what would happen

172
00:11:27,700 --> 00:11:32,700
with the Colorado River for billions of years.

173
00:11:32,700 --> 00:11:39,700
This claim about thermodynamics is widely believed, even though it isn't particularly funny.

174
00:11:39,700 --> 00:11:45,700
And it doesn't matter what the religion is, as long as it uses the Ten Commandments as its basic creed.

175
00:11:45,700 --> 00:11:49,700
Al-Dabang any old crap that fits the Golden Crocoduck criteria?

176
00:11:49,700 --> 00:11:57,700
Who can forget the Iraqi astronomer who thought the earth was flat and the sun is tiny because the Quran says so?

177
00:11:57,700 --> 00:11:59,700
And whatever this is.

178
00:12:03,700 --> 00:12:07,700
This has nothing to do with personal religious belief.

179
00:12:07,700 --> 00:12:16,700
If you practice Christianity, Islam or Judaism or worship any of the millions of deities, saints and spirits out there, no problem.

180
00:12:16,700 --> 00:12:24,700
Just don't start publicly preaching misinformation about science in order to get other people to believe whatever you believe.

181
00:12:24,700 --> 00:12:29,700
If you do, then expect to be challenged as publicly as you evangelise.

182
00:12:30,700 --> 00:12:36,700
Now, as with past practice, I will withdraw any nominee who admits they were wrong or made a mistake.

183
00:12:36,700 --> 00:12:39,700
And that has happened a couple of times.

184
00:12:39,700 --> 00:12:47,700
But it's rare, because creationists seem to have an obsessional, almost pathological inability to admit a single mistake.

185
00:12:47,700 --> 00:12:54,700
I find the same thing with people who disbelieve other aspects of science, from climate change to plate tectonics.

186
00:12:54,700 --> 00:13:01,700
It seems that even the tiniest admission of error will bring their entire belief system crashing down.

187
00:13:01,700 --> 00:13:09,700
Which is the complete opposite of science, where the discovery and correction of errors is part of how science advances.

188
00:13:09,700 --> 00:13:13,700
Come on guys, we all make mistakes, myself included.

189
00:13:13,700 --> 00:13:18,700
Would you rather breach one of your own most sacred commandments than admit you're wrong?

190
00:13:18,700 --> 00:13:21,700
The answer, it seems, is yes.

191
00:13:21,700 --> 00:13:30,700
I was in correspondence with this guy who was nominated for claiming that the shaft of a hammer, known as the London artifact, had turned to coal.

192
00:13:30,700 --> 00:13:36,700
I pointed out that a photo of the hammer in his own videos clearly showed that it hadn't.

193
00:13:36,700 --> 00:13:38,700
Which he didn't dispute.

194
00:13:38,700 --> 00:13:44,700
I offered to give him a chance to admit the error and withdraw his claim, but he simply couldn't bring himself to do that.

195
00:13:44,700 --> 00:13:57,700
And this YouTuber even admitted that his translation of Hitler, proclaiming Darwinism to be the state religion and announcing a plan to exterminate creationists, was completely made up.

196
00:13:57,700 --> 00:14:03,700
He even lied to other creationists who thought the quotes were real and wanted to use them in their own videos.

197
00:14:03,700 --> 00:14:07,700
And you wonder how crap gets passed round the internet.

198
00:14:07,700 --> 00:14:12,700
So it's not always a case of self-delusion or confirmation bias.

199
00:14:12,700 --> 00:14:19,700
A lot of these people are quite happily prepared to lie to further the spread of their own personal beliefs.

200
00:14:19,700 --> 00:14:24,700
I find it highly ironic that they would call upon the laws of a god whom they contend does not even exist.

201
00:14:24,700 --> 00:14:30,700
But you do, Ian. Get it? You are the ones claiming to live by these rules.

202
00:14:30,700 --> 00:14:38,700
Yet you're prepared to breach your own most sacred commandments in order to get people to believe in the very commandments you're breaking.

203
00:14:38,700 --> 00:14:40,700
Now that's irony.

204
00:14:40,700 --> 00:14:47,700
And that sound is the concept of irony and hypocrisy going right over Ian Juby's head.

205
00:14:47,700 --> 00:14:54,700
That's OK. We'll keep showing up your hypocrisy and you keep trying to figure out if the Sun orbits the Earth.

206
00:14:54,700 --> 00:14:58,700
Well, yeah. Because geocentrism would...

207
00:14:58,700 --> 00:15:01,700
I could be wrong on this.

208
00:15:01,700 --> 00:15:03,700
Wait. Don't go yet.

209
00:15:03,700 --> 00:15:10,700
Here's an update from the charity you guys have been supporting, which I ask you to do in lieu of sending me money.

210
00:15:10,700 --> 00:15:20,700
Contributions to date are over $266,000, and I can't tell you how much that's helped expand the work of this charity.

211
00:15:20,700 --> 00:15:29,700
It's an innovative scheme to provide affordable healthcare to people living near national parks in exchange for a verifiable cessation of logging.

212
00:15:29,700 --> 00:15:34,700
The result is better health and a better quality environment.

213
00:15:34,700 --> 00:15:39,700
Thanks to your donations, they've expanded into other countries and are getting great results.

214
00:15:39,700 --> 00:15:45,700
They've been written up in scientific studies and won prestigious awards.

215
00:15:45,700 --> 00:15:52,700
I know many of you have put your hands in your pockets and some have even set up recurring contributions, which is great.

216
00:15:52,700 --> 00:15:55,700
Thank you. Thank you.

217
00:15:55,700 --> 00:16:03,700
So if you're watching my videos for free, even if you get some strange enjoyment from hating them, please consider donating.

218
00:16:03,700 --> 00:16:09,700
Knowing that this channel is doing some good in the world really does keep me going. Thanks.
