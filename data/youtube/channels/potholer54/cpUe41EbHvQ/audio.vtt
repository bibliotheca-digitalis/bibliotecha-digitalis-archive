00:00.000 --> 00:08.340
The heat waves that have occurred in Europe and Asia this summer have made it appear that

00:08.340 --> 00:12.960
the mainstream media has found evidence of a warming climate.

00:12.960 --> 00:19.080
However, more than 1,100 scientists and professionals around the world have signed a World Climate

00:19.080 --> 00:22.640
Declaration stating that there's no climate emergency.

00:22.640 --> 00:29.280
Yes, this new World Climate Declaration issued in June 2022 has got a lot of men in suits

00:29.280 --> 00:34.640
who look into video cameras in front of green screens in their bedrooms very excited.

00:34.640 --> 00:39.120
People have been invited to sign it, and it was so important it was presented to the United

00:39.120 --> 00:42.760
Nations and to the European Parliament.

00:42.760 --> 00:48.160
I thought at first this declaration was just another boring rant by amateurs railing against

00:48.160 --> 00:53.560
science, just like the petition against something called Darwinian theory, then the petition

00:53.560 --> 00:56.240
against CO2-induced warming.

00:56.240 --> 01:00.880
They don't really tell us much except to convince people who aren't very sceptical

01:00.880 --> 01:05.520
that scientific theories are some sort of popularity contest.

01:05.520 --> 01:08.800
And of course, they're trying to persuade politicians.

01:08.800 --> 01:12.140
But then I read the declaration and I was wrong.

01:12.140 --> 01:14.660
It actually does tell us a lot.

01:14.660 --> 01:20.960
Not for what it says, but for what it doesn't say, and for what it tries so hard to imply.

01:20.960 --> 01:23.200
Snack, snap, grin, grin, wink, wink, nudge, nudge, say no more.

01:23.200 --> 01:29.260
So yes, I thought this is funny and disturbing enough to be worth a quick video.

01:29.260 --> 01:31.420
First let's get one thing clear.

01:31.420 --> 01:35.640
It's not the mainstream media that's found evidence of a warming climate.

01:35.640 --> 01:39.920
The mainstream media don't even do climate research any more than most signatories of

01:39.920 --> 01:41.840
these petitions do.

01:41.840 --> 01:47.420
The evidence has been found by climate researchers and published in scientific journals.

01:47.420 --> 01:52.200
In fact, a lot of the mainstream media have spent the last 30 years rejecting the evidence

01:52.200 --> 01:54.080
of global warming.

01:54.080 --> 01:59.400
But why the carefully worded more than 1100 scientists and professionals after all scientists

01:59.400 --> 02:01.120
are professionals.

02:01.120 --> 02:07.920
So why not just say more than 1100 professionals have signed this petition?

02:07.920 --> 02:12.600
To understand why, you have to understand who's organised the petition, a Dutch political

02:12.600 --> 02:15.480
lobby group called Clinton.

02:15.480 --> 02:21.080
The two founders wrote this carefully worded declaration and to bump up the number of signatures,

02:21.080 --> 02:25.240
they invited anyone with a degree and a pulse to sign it.

02:25.240 --> 02:30.320
If you're a dentist or a stockbroker and you have strong feelings about climate science,

02:30.320 --> 02:33.080
you can sign the petition too.

02:33.080 --> 02:38.080
So you have to read the names on the petition to find out that a lot of these scientists

02:38.080 --> 02:43.440
are in fact lawyers, ship designers, political lobbyists, journalists, economists, mining

02:43.440 --> 02:46.280
company CEOs and business owners.

02:46.280 --> 02:50.680
And that's just a fraction of the signatories from Australia alone.

02:50.680 --> 02:56.120
A lot of the actual scientists signing the petition are aircraft engineers, doctors,

02:56.120 --> 03:01.120
seismologists, radiologists, industrial chemists, building engineers, mechanical engineers and

03:01.120 --> 03:05.080
if you don't believe me, just take a look at the list.

03:05.080 --> 03:10.120
So how do we know they understand the first thing about climate science?

03:10.120 --> 03:11.380
We don't of course.

03:11.380 --> 03:15.920
This is pretty much a cross section of people you'll find in a posh village pub.

03:15.920 --> 03:17.880
And more on them later.

03:17.880 --> 03:22.240
Well by calling the signatories scientists and professionals, that sounds very similar

03:22.240 --> 03:26.440
to saying professional scientists.

03:26.440 --> 03:30.600
And then it's easy for men in suits in front of their bedroom green screens to transition

03:30.600 --> 03:34.100
this into a petition by scientists.

03:34.100 --> 03:39.880
And it's easy for one of the founders of Clinton, the aptly named Marcel Crock, to also portray

03:39.880 --> 03:45.720
these poets, lawyers and building engineers as real scientists trying to lecture crazy

03:45.720 --> 03:50.360
journalists on a subject neither group has ever studied.

03:50.360 --> 03:54.400
In reality this petition doesn't come from scientists pushing back against the mainstream

03:54.400 --> 03:55.480
media.

03:55.480 --> 03:57.400
It's the complete opposite.

03:57.400 --> 04:02.560
This is another example of ordinary people who believe what they read in the media pushing

04:02.560 --> 04:05.500
back against the science.

04:05.500 --> 04:09.960
Leaving that aside, I mentioned earlier that what's interesting about this petition isn't

04:09.960 --> 04:13.260
what it says, but what it doesn't say.

04:13.260 --> 04:17.460
The long standing arguments that have now been dropped.

04:17.460 --> 04:21.900
Remember when amateurs like Christopher Monckton used to argue that the world wasn't warming?

04:21.900 --> 04:26.740
No global warming at all for 17 years, 9 months.

04:26.740 --> 04:29.200
Well that claim has now been dropped.

04:29.200 --> 04:33.900
It's no surprise that we're experiencing a period of warming, says the declaration, in

04:33.900 --> 04:37.060
complete contradiction to Monckton's claims.

04:37.060 --> 04:38.860
And who's signed up to that?

04:38.860 --> 04:42.060
Why, it's Christopher Monckton.

04:42.060 --> 04:44.020
The petition goes even further.

04:44.020 --> 04:48.500
In the last declaration signed by assorted doctors and building engineers, the claim

04:48.500 --> 04:53.180
was that CO2 from burning fossil fuels won't disrupt the climate.

04:53.180 --> 04:58.500
And critics like Tim Ball and Ian Clark used to argue that even if the world was warming,

04:58.500 --> 05:00.340
it had nothing to do with carbon dioxide.

05:00.340 --> 05:05.300
No I believe in global warming, I don't believe that human CO2 is causing that warming.

05:05.300 --> 05:09.500
CO2 clearly cannot be causing temperature changes.

05:09.500 --> 05:12.580
But those claims have also been quietly dropped.

05:12.580 --> 05:18.020
Now there's an admission that, as well as natural factors, anthropogenic factors also

05:18.020 --> 05:19.460
cause warming.

05:19.460 --> 05:22.300
In other words, carbon dioxide.

05:22.300 --> 05:25.060
Which means Ball and Clark were wrong.

05:25.060 --> 05:27.540
But guess who's now signed up to that?

05:27.540 --> 05:30.620
Surprise surprise, Tim Ball and Ian Clark.

05:30.620 --> 05:32.100
Here's another one.

05:32.100 --> 05:36.040
Richard Lindsen and William Happer have long been pushing the belief that the earth has

05:36.040 --> 05:39.140
some kind of self-regulating temperature mechanism.

05:39.140 --> 05:44.100
There must be some kind of negative feedback that tends to keep the earth's temperature

05:44.100 --> 05:45.380
about the same.

05:45.380 --> 05:48.540
Tends to keep the earth's temperature about the same?

05:48.540 --> 05:53.340
But as I've shown when I debunk both Lindsen and Happer, the earth's temperature hasn't

05:53.340 --> 05:55.060
stayed about the same.

05:55.060 --> 05:59.140
It's varied considerably over geological time.

05:59.140 --> 06:02.540
So guess which side the petition comes down on.

06:02.540 --> 06:07.700
Earth's climate has varied as long as the planet has existed with natural cold and warm

06:07.700 --> 06:10.220
phases, it says.

06:10.220 --> 06:14.360
You probably think I'm going to show you that Richard Lindsen and William Happer have both

06:14.360 --> 06:18.260
signed the petition that completely contradicts their earlier beliefs.

06:18.260 --> 06:22.380
Well, who am I to disappoint?

06:22.380 --> 06:27.100
But although these longtime critics finally admit that the earth is warming, and that

06:27.100 --> 06:32.460
anthropogenic factors cause warming, and that there's no stabilizing mechanism to stop that

06:32.460 --> 06:39.220
happening, the only way to continue to sow doubt is through, of course, ambiguity, hints

06:39.220 --> 06:41.420
and insinuation.

06:41.420 --> 06:47.340
First, when they say that both natural and anthropogenic factors cause warming, they

06:47.340 --> 06:51.740
deliberately don't specify any particular time period.

06:51.740 --> 06:55.420
So as a general rule, this statement is true.

06:55.420 --> 07:00.680
Natural factors were responsible for past warming, and anthropogenic factors are responsible

07:00.680 --> 07:03.160
for warming now.

07:03.160 --> 07:07.560
The casual reader, however, would take this to mean that both factors are causing warming

07:07.560 --> 07:09.400
today.

07:09.400 --> 07:13.680
Obviously the authors of the Declaration don't dare say that, because they'd be asked to

07:13.680 --> 07:18.960
explain what they think these natural factors might be, and that brings them up against

07:18.960 --> 07:20.640
hard science.

07:20.640 --> 07:22.420
So they have a let out.

07:22.420 --> 07:27.480
They can imply that both factors are at work, and if they're challenged, simply deny the

07:27.480 --> 07:28.480
implication.

07:28.480 --> 07:29.960
Look, are you trying to insinuate something?

07:29.960 --> 07:33.160
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

07:33.160 --> 07:37.040
Next, the Little Ice Age ended as recently as 1850.

07:37.040 --> 07:43.480
Yes, the Little Ice Age ended around 1850, but that was so long ago, I wonder why the

07:43.480 --> 07:46.520
word recently has been inserted.

07:46.520 --> 07:48.600
Let's keep reading and find out.

07:48.600 --> 07:53.240
Therefore, it's no surprise that we're now experiencing a period of warming.

07:53.240 --> 07:58.840
Well, of course, it is no surprise that we're experiencing a period of warming, because

07:58.840 --> 08:04.640
CO2 is a strong greenhouse gas and CO2 concentration has been rising.

08:04.640 --> 08:11.240
The current warming period was predicted as far back as the 1950s and in the 1960s, 70s

08:11.240 --> 08:16.480
and 80s, so no one in climate research was at all surprised.

08:16.480 --> 08:21.420
But adding the word therefore implants the idea that whatever forcing caused the end

08:21.420 --> 08:28.640
of the Little Ice Age in the early 19th century, or recently, as they like to describe it,

08:28.640 --> 08:31.240
had something to do with warming today.

08:31.240 --> 08:34.760
Okay, so what was that?

08:34.760 --> 08:39.640
The Declaration doesn't say, of course, because if they clearly stated that the Little Ice

08:39.640 --> 08:45.240
Age had something to do with recent warming, they'd be forced to explain what that was,

08:45.240 --> 08:49.160
and that would mean tackling the science.

08:49.160 --> 08:53.040
Researchers have found that increased solar activity, measured by sunspot numbers that

08:53.040 --> 08:58.420
were observed at the time, was the most likely cause of the end of the Little Ice Age.

08:58.420 --> 09:02.980
As you can see here, the increase in solar activity at the time correlates very well

09:02.980 --> 09:05.560
with changes in global temperature.

09:05.560 --> 09:10.600
The warming was possibly enhanced by a decrease in volcanic activity that reduced aerosol

09:10.600 --> 09:13.880
concentration in the atmosphere.

09:13.880 --> 09:18.300
But if the authors were to suggest that the same thing is happening now, their petition

09:18.300 --> 09:24.560
would again be laughed at, because those factors clearly aren't responsible for recent warming.

09:24.560 --> 09:30.280
For the last seven decades, solar irradiance has been stable and then falling, and aerosol

09:30.280 --> 09:36.920
concentration has been increasing, thanks to the industrial rise of India and China.

09:36.920 --> 09:41.360
If they suggest the warming was caused by changes in albedo or increased water vapour

09:41.360 --> 09:47.200
concentration, then that's also very easily disproved, because of course these are passive

09:47.200 --> 09:50.220
forcings – they're feedbacks.

09:50.220 --> 09:53.620
Even climate science critics know that.

09:53.620 --> 09:56.000
So instead, they don't explain anything.

09:56.000 --> 10:01.140
They just add a few adverbs and conjunctions to known facts, string them together, and

10:01.140 --> 10:05.780
hope the casual reader will get the impression that the Earth is warming now, due to the

10:05.780 --> 10:08.140
same factors that ended the Little Ice Age.

10:08.140 --> 10:10.300
And not as good as a wink to a blind bat.

10:10.300 --> 10:13.380
And if he does, well, nothing to do with us, Gov.

10:13.380 --> 10:14.900
No, no, no, no, no.

10:14.900 --> 10:20.540
That's the difference between slickly worded petitions signed by lawyers aimed at politicians

10:20.540 --> 10:24.340
and scientific papers aimed at research scientists.

10:24.340 --> 10:28.460
Researchers have to spell out exactly what they're proposing, the method by which they

10:28.460 --> 10:31.740
derived it, and any references they used.

10:31.740 --> 10:36.760
They have to show their data, their evidence, their calculations, and their results, so

10:36.760 --> 10:42.660
it can all be picked apart, scrutinised, and disproved if possible.

10:42.660 --> 10:44.900
Political lobbyists do the complete opposite.

10:44.900 --> 10:47.180
They daren't spell everything out.

10:47.180 --> 10:51.700
By leaving everything vague and ambiguous, they're trying to avoid having their claims

10:51.700 --> 10:53.820
scrutinised or challenged.

10:53.820 --> 10:59.820
OK, let's press on to a claim made in the past by bloggers and lobbyists that CO2 is

10:59.820 --> 11:02.180
too tiny to have any effect.

11:02.180 --> 11:07.820
Why do we suppose that carbon dioxide is responsible for our changing climate?

11:07.820 --> 11:12.920
CO2 forms only a very small part of the Earth's atmosphere.

11:12.920 --> 11:17.020
Only 4% of our greenhouse gas is carbon dioxide.

11:17.020 --> 11:19.660
It's an incredibly small portion.

11:19.660 --> 11:24.340
Carbon dioxide is only a tiny trace gas in the atmosphere.

11:24.340 --> 11:34.140
CO2 now occupies, get this, one ten-thousandth more of the atmosphere than it did in 1750.

11:34.140 --> 11:36.940
That claim is also missing from the petition.

11:36.940 --> 11:40.100
Instead, they argue the complete opposite.

11:40.100 --> 11:45.020
It turns out that this teeny tiny trace gas can have huge effects.

11:45.020 --> 11:49.220
CO2 is essential to all life on Earth, says the petition.

11:49.220 --> 11:55.740
Not only that, the supposedly teeny tiny increase in this teeny tiny trace gas has promoted

11:55.740 --> 11:59.420
growth in global plant biomass.

11:59.420 --> 12:03.580
Which of course it has, as I've explained in my videos and researches have shown in

12:03.580 --> 12:05.940
several studies.

12:05.940 --> 12:10.780
So what happened to the people who thought that a teeny tiny increase in a teeny tiny

12:10.780 --> 12:13.900
trace gas can't possibly have any effect?

12:13.900 --> 12:18.340
Well, we've already seen that Christopher Monckton and Tim Ball have signed up to this

12:18.340 --> 12:24.740
new reality, and yes, so has Jay Lehrer of the Heartland Institute.

12:24.740 --> 12:29.580
The authors of the Declaration do manage to make a few claims very explicitly, without

12:29.580 --> 12:35.820
innuendo, so consequently these can be pretty easily battered out of the ballpark.

12:35.820 --> 12:37.460
Warming is slower than predicted.

12:37.460 --> 12:42.980
The world has warmed significantly less than predicted by the IPCC on the basis of modelled

12:42.980 --> 12:45.540
anthropogenic forcing.

12:45.540 --> 12:50.580
The paragraph that follows also assumes the predictions were inaccurate.

12:50.580 --> 12:54.780
Of course we only have to look at the predictions to see that that's nonsense.

12:54.780 --> 13:00.220
In its first report, the IPCC used this forecast by James Hansen.

13:00.220 --> 13:02.140
There were three scenarios.

13:02.140 --> 13:07.020
Scenario A was based on no action to curb greenhouse emissions and therefore accelerating

13:07.020 --> 13:08.940
CO2 growth.

13:08.940 --> 13:14.340
Scenario B was based on limited action to curb CO2 emissions and linear growth.

13:14.340 --> 13:21.300
And Scenario C was based on strong action to curb CO2 emissions and falling CO2 output.

13:21.300 --> 13:26.420
Thanks to the Kyoto Protocol, what we got was linear growth in CO2 concentration, and

13:26.420 --> 13:30.300
that matched Hansen's forecast pretty well.

13:30.300 --> 13:32.940
But if you're not happy with that, fine.

13:32.940 --> 13:37.380
This was the second IPCC forecast from 1995.

13:37.380 --> 13:40.620
And this one from 2001.

13:40.620 --> 13:43.660
And so on.

13:43.660 --> 13:48.620
All the predictions pretty much match the temperature rise we've seen.

13:48.620 --> 13:52.820
And even if you refuse to accept any of that and just want to focus on the estimate of

13:52.820 --> 13:58.940
climate sensitivity that most results cluster around, a 3 degree centigrade rise for a doubling

13:58.940 --> 14:05.300
of CO2 from pre-industrial levels, that prediction is also right on track.

14:05.300 --> 14:09.860
These real predictions in the scientific literature, going back 40 years, have proved

14:09.860 --> 14:14.580
far more accurate than the predictions of some of the signatories to the petition.

14:14.580 --> 14:19.460
Just look at the contrast between James Hansen's prediction of average global temperatures

14:19.460 --> 14:21.860
and Richard Lindzen's.

14:21.860 --> 14:26.620
And what evidence do the authors of this petition present to back up their claim that warming

14:26.620 --> 14:29.040
is far slower than predicted?

14:29.040 --> 14:32.460
Of course, none at all.

14:32.460 --> 14:36.860
Let's try another statement that actually does make a definitive claim.

14:36.860 --> 14:39.620
Global warming has not increased natural disasters.

14:39.620 --> 14:44.300
There's no statistical evidence that global warming is intensifying hurricanes, floods,

14:44.300 --> 14:50.160
droughts, and such like natural disasters, or making them more frequent.

14:50.160 --> 14:53.140
The obvious question is, how do you know?

14:53.140 --> 14:57.860
Have the authors done a statistical study of all the hurricanes, floods, droughts, and

14:57.860 --> 15:03.660
such like, and published their calculations to be read by all the signatories who unquestioningly

15:03.660 --> 15:05.180
believed it?

15:05.180 --> 15:07.620
If so, where's this study?

15:07.620 --> 15:10.380
Well, no, they haven't.

15:10.380 --> 15:15.380
So when they say there's no statistical evidence, it means they haven't seen any statistical

15:15.380 --> 15:21.420
evidence and neither apparently have the 1,100 plus signatories who believe them.

15:21.420 --> 15:25.940
They're just busy foresters or hardworking coal experts who can't be bothered to wade

15:25.940 --> 15:31.640
through the scientific literature and find it easier just to put their names on a petition.

15:31.640 --> 15:35.040
But it's really not that hard to find this evidence.

15:35.040 --> 15:39.340
Just look at the intensity of hurricanes, because that's very easy to measure.

15:39.340 --> 15:43.740
I found several studies showing that they have indeed grown more intense.

15:43.740 --> 15:48.920
As for global warming making hurricanes more frequent, well, that's one of the effects

15:48.920 --> 15:55.480
the authors of the Declaration seem to think has been predicted as a result of global warming.

15:55.480 --> 15:57.100
But it hasn't.

15:57.100 --> 16:00.980
Climate researchers have always predicted the opposite, that hurricanes would become

16:00.980 --> 16:06.560
less frequent since global warming will reduce global wind circulation and this will increase

16:06.560 --> 16:11.160
wind shear at the tops of hurricanes, chopping them off before they form.

16:11.160 --> 16:14.560
Only the most intense storms will survive.

16:14.560 --> 16:17.960
I covered this in a previous video.

16:17.960 --> 16:19.540
So there's a lesson in this.

16:19.540 --> 16:24.560
If you decide you want to oppose a scientific conclusion that you know very little about

16:24.640 --> 16:30.600
and start a petition, the first step is to at least find out what the scientific conclusion is.

16:30.600 --> 16:35.960
Otherwise you find yourself opposing something that doesn't even exist.

16:35.960 --> 16:39.880
Now let's come back to those signatories, because I'm sure by now there'll be at least

16:39.880 --> 16:42.160
one post in the comments section saying,

16:42.160 --> 16:47.400
But pothola, many of these signatories are actual climatologists.

16:47.400 --> 16:53.520
Well, they've certainly got themselves lots of interesting titles that have the word climatologist in them.

16:53.520 --> 16:58.600
Pavel Duder, excuse my pronunciation, must be a climatologist you'd think, because he

16:58.600 --> 17:00.320
says he is.

17:00.320 --> 17:05.760
But he also says he's a publicist and I can't find any record in the scientific literature

17:05.760 --> 17:09.500
of a climatologist called Pavel Duder.

17:09.500 --> 17:13.800
Lots of people seem to have given themselves the title of climate realist, which isn't

17:13.800 --> 17:17.500
a climatologist and it isn't even a profession.

17:17.500 --> 17:22.080
They seem to practice being a climate realist in their spare time because they have other

17:22.080 --> 17:24.920
qualifications like urologist.

17:24.920 --> 17:29.360
Oh I do beg your pardon, this guy is an informed climate realist.

17:29.360 --> 17:31.520
That's alright then.

17:31.520 --> 17:35.280
One guy calls himself a climate policy commentator.

17:35.280 --> 17:37.960
Real job, anthropologist.

17:37.960 --> 17:41.120
There are lots of people who belong to climate lobbying groups.

17:41.120 --> 17:44.800
That still doesn't make them climatologists.

17:44.800 --> 17:50.320
And being a building engineer who reads climate blogs doesn't make you a climate researcher,

17:50.560 --> 17:55.560
even if you're so convinced you are one that you write it twice.

17:55.560 --> 18:00.800
Okay you might say, but aren't geologists or geophysicists climatologists?

18:00.800 --> 18:02.180
No of course not.

18:02.180 --> 18:06.840
I checked the credentials of some of the geologists on the list and they're mostly involved in

18:06.840 --> 18:11.920
mining geology or other fields like seismology or mineralogy.

18:11.920 --> 18:17.360
Out of the entire list I could only find a handful who had any kind of relevant qualification

18:17.360 --> 18:20.000
in the field of climatology.

18:20.000 --> 18:25.560
Oh pothola, you may remonstrate, you're being an elitist, suggesting that only people with

18:25.560 --> 18:31.400
relevant qualifications should get to sign a petition about a scientific conclusion.

18:31.400 --> 18:33.960
No I'm not saying that at all.

18:33.960 --> 18:38.880
First and foremost, people with relevant qualifications don't go around making vague insinuations

18:38.880 --> 18:42.880
in a petition if they don't like a particular scientific theory.

18:42.880 --> 18:45.100
That's not how science is done.

18:45.100 --> 18:49.960
They publish their evidence clearly and precisely in scientific journals where it can be put

18:49.960 --> 18:52.720
publicly scrutinized and disproved.

18:52.720 --> 18:57.960
Secondly, if a group of doctors and architects don't like a particular scientific theory,

18:57.960 --> 18:59.360
so what?

18:59.360 --> 19:03.860
How is that different to regulars at the local pub deciding they disagree with the theory

19:03.860 --> 19:05.400
of gravity?

19:05.400 --> 19:10.240
Should politicians now make policy decisions about scientific issues like disease control

19:10.240 --> 19:15.520
and earthquake mitigation based on what a bunch of pub-goers sign up to?

19:15.520 --> 19:19.880
I'm also saying there's something far more interesting here than just a bunch of amateurs

19:19.880 --> 19:24.040
deciding they're not happy with the conclusions of climate scientists.

19:24.040 --> 19:26.280
We've seen that before.

19:26.280 --> 19:30.000
What's different is a huge shift in position.

19:30.000 --> 19:34.420
Many of the signatories are bloggers and lobbyists who've long disliked the conclusion that the

19:34.420 --> 19:40.380
Earth is warming and that carbon dioxide is responsible, or even that it could warm.

19:40.500 --> 19:46.900
None of those arguments is stated in this new petition, and most are completely contradicted.

19:46.900 --> 19:52.100
And in place of doubt, which has been the mainstay of the anti-science lobby, from creationists

19:52.100 --> 19:59.380
to tobacco firms to political groups, we now have something far more wussy – ambiguity.

19:59.380 --> 20:03.900
Whereas before they would have wheeled out a few old retired climatologists to say maybe

20:03.900 --> 20:09.020
all the other climatologists are wrong, now the best they can do is drop hints.

20:09.260 --> 20:11.260
Look, are you trying to insinuate something?

20:11.260 --> 20:14.860
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, yes.

20:14.860 --> 20:20.260
I guess catching up to the science of 1955 is progress, right?

20:20.260 --> 20:22.300
One last thing.

20:22.300 --> 20:27.900
Of course, I don't monetise my channel, I don't ask for donations, but if you'd like

20:27.900 --> 20:34.460
me to keep this channel going, I am very encouraged by donations given to a charity that I support.

20:34.460 --> 20:37.380
You'll find all the details in the video description.

20:37.420 --> 20:42.100
So, even if you don't want to help me out, at least please help the charity.

20:42.100 --> 20:42.620
Thanks a lot.
