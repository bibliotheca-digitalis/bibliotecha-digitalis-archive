1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,340
The heat waves that have occurred in Europe and Asia this summer have made it appear that

2
00:00:08,340 --> 00:00:12,960
the mainstream media has found evidence of a warming climate.

3
00:00:12,960 --> 00:00:19,080
However, more than 1,100 scientists and professionals around the world have signed a World Climate

4
00:00:19,080 --> 00:00:22,640
Declaration stating that there's no climate emergency.

5
00:00:22,640 --> 00:00:29,280
Yes, this new World Climate Declaration issued in June 2022 has got a lot of men in suits

6
00:00:29,280 --> 00:00:34,640
who look into video cameras in front of green screens in their bedrooms very excited.

7
00:00:34,640 --> 00:00:39,120
People have been invited to sign it, and it was so important it was presented to the United

8
00:00:39,120 --> 00:00:42,760
Nations and to the European Parliament.

9
00:00:42,760 --> 00:00:48,160
I thought at first this declaration was just another boring rant by amateurs railing against

10
00:00:48,160 --> 00:00:53,560
science, just like the petition against something called Darwinian theory, then the petition

11
00:00:53,560 --> 00:00:56,240
against CO2-induced warming.

12
00:00:56,240 --> 00:01:00,880
They don't really tell us much except to convince people who aren't very sceptical

13
00:01:00,880 --> 00:01:05,520
that scientific theories are some sort of popularity contest.

14
00:01:05,520 --> 00:01:08,800
And of course, they're trying to persuade politicians.

15
00:01:08,800 --> 00:01:12,140
But then I read the declaration and I was wrong.

16
00:01:12,140 --> 00:01:14,660
It actually does tell us a lot.

17
00:01:14,660 --> 00:01:20,960
Not for what it says, but for what it doesn't say, and for what it tries so hard to imply.

18
00:01:20,960 --> 00:01:23,200
Snack, snap, grin, grin, wink, wink, nudge, nudge, say no more.

19
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:29,260
So yes, I thought this is funny and disturbing enough to be worth a quick video.

20
00:01:29,260 --> 00:01:31,420
First let's get one thing clear.

21
00:01:31,420 --> 00:01:35,640
It's not the mainstream media that's found evidence of a warming climate.

22
00:01:35,640 --> 00:01:39,920
The mainstream media don't even do climate research any more than most signatories of

23
00:01:39,920 --> 00:01:41,840
these petitions do.

24
00:01:41,840 --> 00:01:47,420
The evidence has been found by climate researchers and published in scientific journals.

25
00:01:47,420 --> 00:01:52,200
In fact, a lot of the mainstream media have spent the last 30 years rejecting the evidence

26
00:01:52,200 --> 00:01:54,080
of global warming.

27
00:01:54,080 --> 00:01:59,400
But why the carefully worded more than 1100 scientists and professionals after all scientists

28
00:01:59,400 --> 00:02:01,120
are professionals.

29
00:02:01,120 --> 00:02:07,920
So why not just say more than 1100 professionals have signed this petition?

30
00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:12,600
To understand why, you have to understand who's organised the petition, a Dutch political

31
00:02:12,600 --> 00:02:15,480
lobby group called Clinton.

32
00:02:15,480 --> 00:02:21,080
The two founders wrote this carefully worded declaration and to bump up the number of signatures,

33
00:02:21,080 --> 00:02:25,240
they invited anyone with a degree and a pulse to sign it.

34
00:02:25,240 --> 00:02:30,320
If you're a dentist or a stockbroker and you have strong feelings about climate science,

35
00:02:30,320 --> 00:02:33,080
you can sign the petition too.

36
00:02:33,080 --> 00:02:38,080
So you have to read the names on the petition to find out that a lot of these scientists

37
00:02:38,080 --> 00:02:43,440
are in fact lawyers, ship designers, political lobbyists, journalists, economists, mining

38
00:02:43,440 --> 00:02:46,280
company CEOs and business owners.

39
00:02:46,280 --> 00:02:50,680
And that's just a fraction of the signatories from Australia alone.

40
00:02:50,680 --> 00:02:56,120
A lot of the actual scientists signing the petition are aircraft engineers, doctors,

41
00:02:56,120 --> 00:03:01,120
seismologists, radiologists, industrial chemists, building engineers, mechanical engineers and

42
00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:05,080
if you don't believe me, just take a look at the list.

43
00:03:05,080 --> 00:03:10,120
So how do we know they understand the first thing about climate science?

44
00:03:10,120 --> 00:03:11,380
We don't of course.

45
00:03:11,380 --> 00:03:15,920
This is pretty much a cross section of people you'll find in a posh village pub.

46
00:03:15,920 --> 00:03:17,880
And more on them later.

47
00:03:17,880 --> 00:03:22,240
Well by calling the signatories scientists and professionals, that sounds very similar

48
00:03:22,240 --> 00:03:26,440
to saying professional scientists.

49
00:03:26,440 --> 00:03:30,600
And then it's easy for men in suits in front of their bedroom green screens to transition

50
00:03:30,600 --> 00:03:34,100
this into a petition by scientists.

51
00:03:34,100 --> 00:03:39,880
And it's easy for one of the founders of Clinton, the aptly named Marcel Crock, to also portray

52
00:03:39,880 --> 00:03:45,720
these poets, lawyers and building engineers as real scientists trying to lecture crazy

53
00:03:45,720 --> 00:03:50,360
journalists on a subject neither group has ever studied.

54
00:03:50,360 --> 00:03:54,400
In reality this petition doesn't come from scientists pushing back against the mainstream

55
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:55,480
media.

56
00:03:55,480 --> 00:03:57,400
It's the complete opposite.

57
00:03:57,400 --> 00:04:02,560
This is another example of ordinary people who believe what they read in the media pushing

58
00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:05,500
back against the science.

59
00:04:05,500 --> 00:04:09,960
Leaving that aside, I mentioned earlier that what's interesting about this petition isn't

60
00:04:09,960 --> 00:04:13,260
what it says, but what it doesn't say.

61
00:04:13,260 --> 00:04:17,460
The long standing arguments that have now been dropped.

62
00:04:17,460 --> 00:04:21,900
Remember when amateurs like Christopher Monckton used to argue that the world wasn't warming?

63
00:04:21,900 --> 00:04:26,740
No global warming at all for 17 years, 9 months.

64
00:04:26,740 --> 00:04:29,200
Well that claim has now been dropped.

65
00:04:29,200 --> 00:04:33,900
It's no surprise that we're experiencing a period of warming, says the declaration, in

66
00:04:33,900 --> 00:04:37,060
complete contradiction to Monckton's claims.

67
00:04:37,060 --> 00:04:38,860
And who's signed up to that?

68
00:04:38,860 --> 00:04:42,060
Why, it's Christopher Monckton.

69
00:04:42,060 --> 00:04:44,020
The petition goes even further.

70
00:04:44,020 --> 00:04:48,500
In the last declaration signed by assorted doctors and building engineers, the claim

71
00:04:48,500 --> 00:04:53,180
was that CO2 from burning fossil fuels won't disrupt the climate.

72
00:04:53,180 --> 00:04:58,500
And critics like Tim Ball and Ian Clark used to argue that even if the world was warming,

73
00:04:58,500 --> 00:05:00,340
it had nothing to do with carbon dioxide.

74
00:05:00,340 --> 00:05:05,300
No I believe in global warming, I don't believe that human CO2 is causing that warming.

75
00:05:05,300 --> 00:05:09,500
CO2 clearly cannot be causing temperature changes.

76
00:05:09,500 --> 00:05:12,580
But those claims have also been quietly dropped.

77
00:05:12,580 --> 00:05:18,020
Now there's an admission that, as well as natural factors, anthropogenic factors also

78
00:05:18,020 --> 00:05:19,460
cause warming.

79
00:05:19,460 --> 00:05:22,300
In other words, carbon dioxide.

80
00:05:22,300 --> 00:05:25,060
Which means Ball and Clark were wrong.

81
00:05:25,060 --> 00:05:27,540
But guess who's now signed up to that?

82
00:05:27,540 --> 00:05:30,620
Surprise surprise, Tim Ball and Ian Clark.

83
00:05:30,620 --> 00:05:32,100
Here's another one.

84
00:05:32,100 --> 00:05:36,040
Richard Lindsen and William Happer have long been pushing the belief that the earth has

85
00:05:36,040 --> 00:05:39,140
some kind of self-regulating temperature mechanism.

86
00:05:39,140 --> 00:05:44,100
There must be some kind of negative feedback that tends to keep the earth's temperature

87
00:05:44,100 --> 00:05:45,380
about the same.

88
00:05:45,380 --> 00:05:48,540
Tends to keep the earth's temperature about the same?

89
00:05:48,540 --> 00:05:53,340
But as I've shown when I debunk both Lindsen and Happer, the earth's temperature hasn't

90
00:05:53,340 --> 00:05:55,060
stayed about the same.

91
00:05:55,060 --> 00:05:59,140
It's varied considerably over geological time.

92
00:05:59,140 --> 00:06:02,540
So guess which side the petition comes down on.

93
00:06:02,540 --> 00:06:07,700
Earth's climate has varied as long as the planet has existed with natural cold and warm

94
00:06:07,700 --> 00:06:10,220
phases, it says.

95
00:06:10,220 --> 00:06:14,360
You probably think I'm going to show you that Richard Lindsen and William Happer have both

96
00:06:14,360 --> 00:06:18,260
signed the petition that completely contradicts their earlier beliefs.

97
00:06:18,260 --> 00:06:22,380
Well, who am I to disappoint?

98
00:06:22,380 --> 00:06:27,100
But although these longtime critics finally admit that the earth is warming, and that

99
00:06:27,100 --> 00:06:32,460
anthropogenic factors cause warming, and that there's no stabilizing mechanism to stop that

100
00:06:32,460 --> 00:06:39,220
happening, the only way to continue to sow doubt is through, of course, ambiguity, hints

101
00:06:39,220 --> 00:06:41,420
and insinuation.

102
00:06:41,420 --> 00:06:47,340
First, when they say that both natural and anthropogenic factors cause warming, they

103
00:06:47,340 --> 00:06:51,740
deliberately don't specify any particular time period.

104
00:06:51,740 --> 00:06:55,420
So as a general rule, this statement is true.

105
00:06:55,420 --> 00:07:00,680
Natural factors were responsible for past warming, and anthropogenic factors are responsible

106
00:07:00,680 --> 00:07:03,160
for warming now.

107
00:07:03,160 --> 00:07:07,560
The casual reader, however, would take this to mean that both factors are causing warming

108
00:07:07,560 --> 00:07:09,400
today.

109
00:07:09,400 --> 00:07:13,680
Obviously the authors of the Declaration don't dare say that, because they'd be asked to

110
00:07:13,680 --> 00:07:18,960
explain what they think these natural factors might be, and that brings them up against

111
00:07:18,960 --> 00:07:20,640
hard science.

112
00:07:20,640 --> 00:07:22,420
So they have a let out.

113
00:07:22,420 --> 00:07:27,480
They can imply that both factors are at work, and if they're challenged, simply deny the

114
00:07:27,480 --> 00:07:28,480
implication.

115
00:07:28,480 --> 00:07:29,960
Look, are you trying to insinuate something?

116
00:07:29,960 --> 00:07:33,160
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

117
00:07:33,160 --> 00:07:37,040
Next, the Little Ice Age ended as recently as 1850.

118
00:07:37,040 --> 00:07:43,480
Yes, the Little Ice Age ended around 1850, but that was so long ago, I wonder why the

119
00:07:43,480 --> 00:07:46,520
word recently has been inserted.

120
00:07:46,520 --> 00:07:48,600
Let's keep reading and find out.

121
00:07:48,600 --> 00:07:53,240
Therefore, it's no surprise that we're now experiencing a period of warming.

122
00:07:53,240 --> 00:07:58,840
Well, of course, it is no surprise that we're experiencing a period of warming, because

123
00:07:58,840 --> 00:08:04,640
CO2 is a strong greenhouse gas and CO2 concentration has been rising.

124
00:08:04,640 --> 00:08:11,240
The current warming period was predicted as far back as the 1950s and in the 1960s, 70s

125
00:08:11,240 --> 00:08:16,480
and 80s, so no one in climate research was at all surprised.

126
00:08:16,480 --> 00:08:21,420
But adding the word therefore implants the idea that whatever forcing caused the end

127
00:08:21,420 --> 00:08:28,640
of the Little Ice Age in the early 19th century, or recently, as they like to describe it,

128
00:08:28,640 --> 00:08:31,240
had something to do with warming today.

129
00:08:31,240 --> 00:08:34,760
Okay, so what was that?

130
00:08:34,760 --> 00:08:39,640
The Declaration doesn't say, of course, because if they clearly stated that the Little Ice

131
00:08:39,640 --> 00:08:45,240
Age had something to do with recent warming, they'd be forced to explain what that was,

132
00:08:45,240 --> 00:08:49,160
and that would mean tackling the science.

133
00:08:49,160 --> 00:08:53,040
Researchers have found that increased solar activity, measured by sunspot numbers that

134
00:08:53,040 --> 00:08:58,420
were observed at the time, was the most likely cause of the end of the Little Ice Age.

135
00:08:58,420 --> 00:09:02,980
As you can see here, the increase in solar activity at the time correlates very well

136
00:09:02,980 --> 00:09:05,560
with changes in global temperature.

137
00:09:05,560 --> 00:09:10,600
The warming was possibly enhanced by a decrease in volcanic activity that reduced aerosol

138
00:09:10,600 --> 00:09:13,880
concentration in the atmosphere.

139
00:09:13,880 --> 00:09:18,300
But if the authors were to suggest that the same thing is happening now, their petition

140
00:09:18,300 --> 00:09:24,560
would again be laughed at, because those factors clearly aren't responsible for recent warming.

141
00:09:24,560 --> 00:09:30,280
For the last seven decades, solar irradiance has been stable and then falling, and aerosol

142
00:09:30,280 --> 00:09:36,920
concentration has been increasing, thanks to the industrial rise of India and China.

143
00:09:36,920 --> 00:09:41,360
If they suggest the warming was caused by changes in albedo or increased water vapour

144
00:09:41,360 --> 00:09:47,200
concentration, then that's also very easily disproved, because of course these are passive

145
00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:50,220
forcings – they're feedbacks.

146
00:09:50,220 --> 00:09:53,620
Even climate science critics know that.

147
00:09:53,620 --> 00:09:56,000
So instead, they don't explain anything.

148
00:09:56,000 --> 00:10:01,140
They just add a few adverbs and conjunctions to known facts, string them together, and

149
00:10:01,140 --> 00:10:05,780
hope the casual reader will get the impression that the Earth is warming now, due to the

150
00:10:05,780 --> 00:10:08,140
same factors that ended the Little Ice Age.

151
00:10:08,140 --> 00:10:10,300
And not as good as a wink to a blind bat.

152
00:10:10,300 --> 00:10:13,380
And if he does, well, nothing to do with us, Gov.

153
00:10:13,380 --> 00:10:14,900
No, no, no, no, no.

154
00:10:14,900 --> 00:10:20,540
That's the difference between slickly worded petitions signed by lawyers aimed at politicians

155
00:10:20,540 --> 00:10:24,340
and scientific papers aimed at research scientists.

156
00:10:24,340 --> 00:10:28,460
Researchers have to spell out exactly what they're proposing, the method by which they

157
00:10:28,460 --> 00:10:31,740
derived it, and any references they used.

158
00:10:31,740 --> 00:10:36,760
They have to show their data, their evidence, their calculations, and their results, so

159
00:10:36,760 --> 00:10:42,660
it can all be picked apart, scrutinised, and disproved if possible.

160
00:10:42,660 --> 00:10:44,900
Political lobbyists do the complete opposite.

161
00:10:44,900 --> 00:10:47,180
They daren't spell everything out.

162
00:10:47,180 --> 00:10:51,700
By leaving everything vague and ambiguous, they're trying to avoid having their claims

163
00:10:51,700 --> 00:10:53,820
scrutinised or challenged.

164
00:10:53,820 --> 00:10:59,820
OK, let's press on to a claim made in the past by bloggers and lobbyists that CO2 is

165
00:10:59,820 --> 00:11:02,180
too tiny to have any effect.

166
00:11:02,180 --> 00:11:07,820
Why do we suppose that carbon dioxide is responsible for our changing climate?

167
00:11:07,820 --> 00:11:12,920
CO2 forms only a very small part of the Earth's atmosphere.

168
00:11:12,920 --> 00:11:17,020
Only 4% of our greenhouse gas is carbon dioxide.

169
00:11:17,020 --> 00:11:19,660
It's an incredibly small portion.

170
00:11:19,660 --> 00:11:24,340
Carbon dioxide is only a tiny trace gas in the atmosphere.

171
00:11:24,340 --> 00:11:34,140
CO2 now occupies, get this, one ten-thousandth more of the atmosphere than it did in 1750.

172
00:11:34,140 --> 00:11:36,940
That claim is also missing from the petition.

173
00:11:36,940 --> 00:11:40,100
Instead, they argue the complete opposite.

174
00:11:40,100 --> 00:11:45,020
It turns out that this teeny tiny trace gas can have huge effects.

175
00:11:45,020 --> 00:11:49,220
CO2 is essential to all life on Earth, says the petition.

176
00:11:49,220 --> 00:11:55,740
Not only that, the supposedly teeny tiny increase in this teeny tiny trace gas has promoted

177
00:11:55,740 --> 00:11:59,420
growth in global plant biomass.

178
00:11:59,420 --> 00:12:03,580
Which of course it has, as I've explained in my videos and researches have shown in

179
00:12:03,580 --> 00:12:05,940
several studies.

180
00:12:05,940 --> 00:12:10,780
So what happened to the people who thought that a teeny tiny increase in a teeny tiny

181
00:12:10,780 --> 00:12:13,900
trace gas can't possibly have any effect?

182
00:12:13,900 --> 00:12:18,340
Well, we've already seen that Christopher Monckton and Tim Ball have signed up to this

183
00:12:18,340 --> 00:12:24,740
new reality, and yes, so has Jay Lehrer of the Heartland Institute.

184
00:12:24,740 --> 00:12:29,580
The authors of the Declaration do manage to make a few claims very explicitly, without

185
00:12:29,580 --> 00:12:35,820
innuendo, so consequently these can be pretty easily battered out of the ballpark.

186
00:12:35,820 --> 00:12:37,460
Warming is slower than predicted.

187
00:12:37,460 --> 00:12:42,980
The world has warmed significantly less than predicted by the IPCC on the basis of modelled

188
00:12:42,980 --> 00:12:45,540
anthropogenic forcing.

189
00:12:45,540 --> 00:12:50,580
The paragraph that follows also assumes the predictions were inaccurate.

190
00:12:50,580 --> 00:12:54,780
Of course we only have to look at the predictions to see that that's nonsense.

191
00:12:54,780 --> 00:13:00,220
In its first report, the IPCC used this forecast by James Hansen.

192
00:13:00,220 --> 00:13:02,140
There were three scenarios.

193
00:13:02,140 --> 00:13:07,020
Scenario A was based on no action to curb greenhouse emissions and therefore accelerating

194
00:13:07,020 --> 00:13:08,940
CO2 growth.

195
00:13:08,940 --> 00:13:14,340
Scenario B was based on limited action to curb CO2 emissions and linear growth.

196
00:13:14,340 --> 00:13:21,300
And Scenario C was based on strong action to curb CO2 emissions and falling CO2 output.

197
00:13:21,300 --> 00:13:26,420
Thanks to the Kyoto Protocol, what we got was linear growth in CO2 concentration, and

198
00:13:26,420 --> 00:13:30,300
that matched Hansen's forecast pretty well.

199
00:13:30,300 --> 00:13:32,940
But if you're not happy with that, fine.

200
00:13:32,940 --> 00:13:37,380
This was the second IPCC forecast from 1995.

201
00:13:37,380 --> 00:13:40,620
And this one from 2001.

202
00:13:40,620 --> 00:13:43,660
And so on.

203
00:13:43,660 --> 00:13:48,620
All the predictions pretty much match the temperature rise we've seen.

204
00:13:48,620 --> 00:13:52,820
And even if you refuse to accept any of that and just want to focus on the estimate of

205
00:13:52,820 --> 00:13:58,940
climate sensitivity that most results cluster around, a 3 degree centigrade rise for a doubling

206
00:13:58,940 --> 00:14:05,300
of CO2 from pre-industrial levels, that prediction is also right on track.

207
00:14:05,300 --> 00:14:09,860
These real predictions in the scientific literature, going back 40 years, have proved

208
00:14:09,860 --> 00:14:14,580
far more accurate than the predictions of some of the signatories to the petition.

209
00:14:14,580 --> 00:14:19,460
Just look at the contrast between James Hansen's prediction of average global temperatures

210
00:14:19,460 --> 00:14:21,860
and Richard Lindzen's.

211
00:14:21,860 --> 00:14:26,620
And what evidence do the authors of this petition present to back up their claim that warming

212
00:14:26,620 --> 00:14:29,040
is far slower than predicted?

213
00:14:29,040 --> 00:14:32,460
Of course, none at all.

214
00:14:32,460 --> 00:14:36,860
Let's try another statement that actually does make a definitive claim.

215
00:14:36,860 --> 00:14:39,620
Global warming has not increased natural disasters.

216
00:14:39,620 --> 00:14:44,300
There's no statistical evidence that global warming is intensifying hurricanes, floods,

217
00:14:44,300 --> 00:14:50,160
droughts, and such like natural disasters, or making them more frequent.

218
00:14:50,160 --> 00:14:53,140
The obvious question is, how do you know?

219
00:14:53,140 --> 00:14:57,860
Have the authors done a statistical study of all the hurricanes, floods, droughts, and

220
00:14:57,860 --> 00:15:03,660
such like, and published their calculations to be read by all the signatories who unquestioningly

221
00:15:03,660 --> 00:15:05,180
believed it?

222
00:15:05,180 --> 00:15:07,620
If so, where's this study?

223
00:15:07,620 --> 00:15:10,380
Well, no, they haven't.

224
00:15:10,380 --> 00:15:15,380
So when they say there's no statistical evidence, it means they haven't seen any statistical

225
00:15:15,380 --> 00:15:21,420
evidence and neither apparently have the 1,100 plus signatories who believe them.

226
00:15:21,420 --> 00:15:25,940
They're just busy foresters or hardworking coal experts who can't be bothered to wade

227
00:15:25,940 --> 00:15:31,640
through the scientific literature and find it easier just to put their names on a petition.

228
00:15:31,640 --> 00:15:35,040
But it's really not that hard to find this evidence.

229
00:15:35,040 --> 00:15:39,340
Just look at the intensity of hurricanes, because that's very easy to measure.

230
00:15:39,340 --> 00:15:43,740
I found several studies showing that they have indeed grown more intense.

231
00:15:43,740 --> 00:15:48,920
As for global warming making hurricanes more frequent, well, that's one of the effects

232
00:15:48,920 --> 00:15:55,480
the authors of the Declaration seem to think has been predicted as a result of global warming.

233
00:15:55,480 --> 00:15:57,100
But it hasn't.

234
00:15:57,100 --> 00:16:00,980
Climate researchers have always predicted the opposite, that hurricanes would become

235
00:16:00,980 --> 00:16:06,560
less frequent since global warming will reduce global wind circulation and this will increase

236
00:16:06,560 --> 00:16:11,160
wind shear at the tops of hurricanes, chopping them off before they form.

237
00:16:11,160 --> 00:16:14,560
Only the most intense storms will survive.

238
00:16:14,560 --> 00:16:17,960
I covered this in a previous video.

239
00:16:17,960 --> 00:16:19,540
So there's a lesson in this.

240
00:16:19,540 --> 00:16:24,560
If you decide you want to oppose a scientific conclusion that you know very little about

241
00:16:24,640 --> 00:16:30,600
and start a petition, the first step is to at least find out what the scientific conclusion is.

242
00:16:30,600 --> 00:16:35,960
Otherwise you find yourself opposing something that doesn't even exist.

243
00:16:35,960 --> 00:16:39,880
Now let's come back to those signatories, because I'm sure by now there'll be at least

244
00:16:39,880 --> 00:16:42,160
one post in the comments section saying,

245
00:16:42,160 --> 00:16:47,400
But pothola, many of these signatories are actual climatologists.

246
00:16:47,400 --> 00:16:53,520
Well, they've certainly got themselves lots of interesting titles that have the word climatologist in them.

247
00:16:53,520 --> 00:16:58,600
Pavel Duder, excuse my pronunciation, must be a climatologist you'd think, because he

248
00:16:58,600 --> 00:17:00,320
says he is.

249
00:17:00,320 --> 00:17:05,760
But he also says he's a publicist and I can't find any record in the scientific literature

250
00:17:05,760 --> 00:17:09,500
of a climatologist called Pavel Duder.

251
00:17:09,500 --> 00:17:13,800
Lots of people seem to have given themselves the title of climate realist, which isn't

252
00:17:13,800 --> 00:17:17,500
a climatologist and it isn't even a profession.

253
00:17:17,500 --> 00:17:22,080
They seem to practice being a climate realist in their spare time because they have other

254
00:17:22,080 --> 00:17:24,920
qualifications like urologist.

255
00:17:24,920 --> 00:17:29,360
Oh I do beg your pardon, this guy is an informed climate realist.

256
00:17:29,360 --> 00:17:31,520
That's alright then.

257
00:17:31,520 --> 00:17:35,280
One guy calls himself a climate policy commentator.

258
00:17:35,280 --> 00:17:37,960
Real job, anthropologist.

259
00:17:37,960 --> 00:17:41,120
There are lots of people who belong to climate lobbying groups.

260
00:17:41,120 --> 00:17:44,800
That still doesn't make them climatologists.

261
00:17:44,800 --> 00:17:50,320
And being a building engineer who reads climate blogs doesn't make you a climate researcher,

262
00:17:50,560 --> 00:17:55,560
even if you're so convinced you are one that you write it twice.

263
00:17:55,560 --> 00:18:00,800
Okay you might say, but aren't geologists or geophysicists climatologists?

264
00:18:00,800 --> 00:18:02,180
No of course not.

265
00:18:02,180 --> 00:18:06,840
I checked the credentials of some of the geologists on the list and they're mostly involved in

266
00:18:06,840 --> 00:18:11,920
mining geology or other fields like seismology or mineralogy.

267
00:18:11,920 --> 00:18:17,360
Out of the entire list I could only find a handful who had any kind of relevant qualification

268
00:18:17,360 --> 00:18:20,000
in the field of climatology.

269
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:25,560
Oh pothola, you may remonstrate, you're being an elitist, suggesting that only people with

270
00:18:25,560 --> 00:18:31,400
relevant qualifications should get to sign a petition about a scientific conclusion.

271
00:18:31,400 --> 00:18:33,960
No I'm not saying that at all.

272
00:18:33,960 --> 00:18:38,880
First and foremost, people with relevant qualifications don't go around making vague insinuations

273
00:18:38,880 --> 00:18:42,880
in a petition if they don't like a particular scientific theory.

274
00:18:42,880 --> 00:18:45,100
That's not how science is done.

275
00:18:45,100 --> 00:18:49,960
They publish their evidence clearly and precisely in scientific journals where it can be put

276
00:18:49,960 --> 00:18:52,720
publicly scrutinized and disproved.

277
00:18:52,720 --> 00:18:57,960
Secondly, if a group of doctors and architects don't like a particular scientific theory,

278
00:18:57,960 --> 00:18:59,360
so what?

279
00:18:59,360 --> 00:19:03,860
How is that different to regulars at the local pub deciding they disagree with the theory

280
00:19:03,860 --> 00:19:05,400
of gravity?

281
00:19:05,400 --> 00:19:10,240
Should politicians now make policy decisions about scientific issues like disease control

282
00:19:10,240 --> 00:19:15,520
and earthquake mitigation based on what a bunch of pub-goers sign up to?

283
00:19:15,520 --> 00:19:19,880
I'm also saying there's something far more interesting here than just a bunch of amateurs

284
00:19:19,880 --> 00:19:24,040
deciding they're not happy with the conclusions of climate scientists.

285
00:19:24,040 --> 00:19:26,280
We've seen that before.

286
00:19:26,280 --> 00:19:30,000
What's different is a huge shift in position.

287
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:34,420
Many of the signatories are bloggers and lobbyists who've long disliked the conclusion that the

288
00:19:34,420 --> 00:19:40,380
Earth is warming and that carbon dioxide is responsible, or even that it could warm.

289
00:19:40,500 --> 00:19:46,900
None of those arguments is stated in this new petition, and most are completely contradicted.

290
00:19:46,900 --> 00:19:52,100
And in place of doubt, which has been the mainstay of the anti-science lobby, from creationists

291
00:19:52,100 --> 00:19:59,380
to tobacco firms to political groups, we now have something far more wussy – ambiguity.

292
00:19:59,380 --> 00:20:03,900
Whereas before they would have wheeled out a few old retired climatologists to say maybe

293
00:20:03,900 --> 00:20:09,020
all the other climatologists are wrong, now the best they can do is drop hints.

294
00:20:09,260 --> 00:20:11,260
Look, are you trying to insinuate something?

295
00:20:11,260 --> 00:20:14,860
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, yes.

296
00:20:14,860 --> 00:20:20,260
I guess catching up to the science of 1955 is progress, right?

297
00:20:20,260 --> 00:20:22,300
One last thing.

298
00:20:22,300 --> 00:20:27,900
Of course, I don't monetise my channel, I don't ask for donations, but if you'd like

299
00:20:27,900 --> 00:20:34,460
me to keep this channel going, I am very encouraged by donations given to a charity that I support.

300
00:20:34,460 --> 00:20:37,380
You'll find all the details in the video description.

301
00:20:37,420 --> 00:20:42,100
So, even if you don't want to help me out, at least please help the charity.

302
00:20:42,100 --> 00:20:42,620
Thanks a lot.
