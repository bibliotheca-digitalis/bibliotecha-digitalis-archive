0	8340	The heat waves that have occurred in Europe and Asia this summer have made it appear that
8340	12960	the mainstream media has found evidence of a warming climate.
12960	19080	However, more than 1,100 scientists and professionals around the world have signed a World Climate
19080	22640	Declaration stating that there's no climate emergency.
22640	29280	Yes, this new World Climate Declaration issued in June 2022 has got a lot of men in suits
29280	34640	who look into video cameras in front of green screens in their bedrooms very excited.
34640	39120	People have been invited to sign it, and it was so important it was presented to the United
39120	42760	Nations and to the European Parliament.
42760	48160	I thought at first this declaration was just another boring rant by amateurs railing against
48160	53560	science, just like the petition against something called Darwinian theory, then the petition
53560	56240	against CO2-induced warming.
56240	60880	They don't really tell us much except to convince people who aren't very sceptical
60880	65520	that scientific theories are some sort of popularity contest.
65520	68800	And of course, they're trying to persuade politicians.
68800	72140	But then I read the declaration and I was wrong.
72140	74660	It actually does tell us a lot.
74660	80960	Not for what it says, but for what it doesn't say, and for what it tries so hard to imply.
80960	83200	Snack, snap, grin, grin, wink, wink, nudge, nudge, say no more.
83200	89260	So yes, I thought this is funny and disturbing enough to be worth a quick video.
89260	91420	First let's get one thing clear.
91420	95640	It's not the mainstream media that's found evidence of a warming climate.
95640	99920	The mainstream media don't even do climate research any more than most signatories of
99920	101840	these petitions do.
101840	107420	The evidence has been found by climate researchers and published in scientific journals.
107420	112200	In fact, a lot of the mainstream media have spent the last 30 years rejecting the evidence
112200	114080	of global warming.
114080	119400	But why the carefully worded more than 1100 scientists and professionals after all scientists
119400	121120	are professionals.
121120	127920	So why not just say more than 1100 professionals have signed this petition?
127920	132600	To understand why, you have to understand who's organised the petition, a Dutch political
132600	135480	lobby group called Clinton.
135480	141080	The two founders wrote this carefully worded declaration and to bump up the number of signatures,
141080	145240	they invited anyone with a degree and a pulse to sign it.
145240	150320	If you're a dentist or a stockbroker and you have strong feelings about climate science,
150320	153080	you can sign the petition too.
153080	158080	So you have to read the names on the petition to find out that a lot of these scientists
158080	163440	are in fact lawyers, ship designers, political lobbyists, journalists, economists, mining
163440	166280	company CEOs and business owners.
166280	170680	And that's just a fraction of the signatories from Australia alone.
170680	176120	A lot of the actual scientists signing the petition are aircraft engineers, doctors,
176120	181120	seismologists, radiologists, industrial chemists, building engineers, mechanical engineers and
181120	185080	if you don't believe me, just take a look at the list.
185080	190120	So how do we know they understand the first thing about climate science?
190120	191380	We don't of course.
191380	195920	This is pretty much a cross section of people you'll find in a posh village pub.
195920	197880	And more on them later.
197880	202240	Well by calling the signatories scientists and professionals, that sounds very similar
202240	206440	to saying professional scientists.
206440	210600	And then it's easy for men in suits in front of their bedroom green screens to transition
210600	214100	this into a petition by scientists.
214100	219880	And it's easy for one of the founders of Clinton, the aptly named Marcel Crock, to also portray
219880	225720	these poets, lawyers and building engineers as real scientists trying to lecture crazy
225720	230360	journalists on a subject neither group has ever studied.
230360	234400	In reality this petition doesn't come from scientists pushing back against the mainstream
234400	235480	media.
235480	237400	It's the complete opposite.
237400	242560	This is another example of ordinary people who believe what they read in the media pushing
242560	245500	back against the science.
245500	249960	Leaving that aside, I mentioned earlier that what's interesting about this petition isn't
249960	253260	what it says, but what it doesn't say.
253260	257460	The long standing arguments that have now been dropped.
257460	261900	Remember when amateurs like Christopher Monckton used to argue that the world wasn't warming?
261900	266740	No global warming at all for 17 years, 9 months.
266740	269200	Well that claim has now been dropped.
269200	273900	It's no surprise that we're experiencing a period of warming, says the declaration, in
273900	277060	complete contradiction to Monckton's claims.
277060	278860	And who's signed up to that?
278860	282060	Why, it's Christopher Monckton.
282060	284020	The petition goes even further.
284020	288500	In the last declaration signed by assorted doctors and building engineers, the claim
288500	293180	was that CO2 from burning fossil fuels won't disrupt the climate.
293180	298500	And critics like Tim Ball and Ian Clark used to argue that even if the world was warming,
298500	300340	it had nothing to do with carbon dioxide.
300340	305300	No I believe in global warming, I don't believe that human CO2 is causing that warming.
305300	309500	CO2 clearly cannot be causing temperature changes.
309500	312580	But those claims have also been quietly dropped.
312580	318020	Now there's an admission that, as well as natural factors, anthropogenic factors also
318020	319460	cause warming.
319460	322300	In other words, carbon dioxide.
322300	325060	Which means Ball and Clark were wrong.
325060	327540	But guess who's now signed up to that?
327540	330620	Surprise surprise, Tim Ball and Ian Clark.
330620	332100	Here's another one.
332100	336040	Richard Lindsen and William Happer have long been pushing the belief that the earth has
336040	339140	some kind of self-regulating temperature mechanism.
339140	344100	There must be some kind of negative feedback that tends to keep the earth's temperature
344100	345380	about the same.
345380	348540	Tends to keep the earth's temperature about the same?
348540	353340	But as I've shown when I debunk both Lindsen and Happer, the earth's temperature hasn't
353340	355060	stayed about the same.
355060	359140	It's varied considerably over geological time.
359140	362540	So guess which side the petition comes down on.
362540	367700	Earth's climate has varied as long as the planet has existed with natural cold and warm
367700	370220	phases, it says.
370220	374360	You probably think I'm going to show you that Richard Lindsen and William Happer have both
374360	378260	signed the petition that completely contradicts their earlier beliefs.
378260	382380	Well, who am I to disappoint?
382380	387100	But although these longtime critics finally admit that the earth is warming, and that
387100	392460	anthropogenic factors cause warming, and that there's no stabilizing mechanism to stop that
392460	399220	happening, the only way to continue to sow doubt is through, of course, ambiguity, hints
399220	401420	and insinuation.
401420	407340	First, when they say that both natural and anthropogenic factors cause warming, they
407340	411740	deliberately don't specify any particular time period.
411740	415420	So as a general rule, this statement is true.
415420	420680	Natural factors were responsible for past warming, and anthropogenic factors are responsible
420680	423160	for warming now.
423160	427560	The casual reader, however, would take this to mean that both factors are causing warming
427560	429400	today.
429400	433680	Obviously the authors of the Declaration don't dare say that, because they'd be asked to
433680	438960	explain what they think these natural factors might be, and that brings them up against
438960	440640	hard science.
440640	442420	So they have a let out.
442420	447480	They can imply that both factors are at work, and if they're challenged, simply deny the
447480	448480	implication.
448480	449960	Look, are you trying to insinuate something?
449960	453160	No, no, no, no, no, no, no.
453160	457040	Next, the Little Ice Age ended as recently as 1850.
457040	463480	Yes, the Little Ice Age ended around 1850, but that was so long ago, I wonder why the
463480	466520	word recently has been inserted.
466520	468600	Let's keep reading and find out.
468600	473240	Therefore, it's no surprise that we're now experiencing a period of warming.
473240	478840	Well, of course, it is no surprise that we're experiencing a period of warming, because
478840	484640	CO2 is a strong greenhouse gas and CO2 concentration has been rising.
484640	491240	The current warming period was predicted as far back as the 1950s and in the 1960s, 70s
491240	496480	and 80s, so no one in climate research was at all surprised.
496480	501420	But adding the word therefore implants the idea that whatever forcing caused the end
501420	508640	of the Little Ice Age in the early 19th century, or recently, as they like to describe it,
508640	511240	had something to do with warming today.
511240	514760	Okay, so what was that?
514760	519640	The Declaration doesn't say, of course, because if they clearly stated that the Little Ice
519640	525240	Age had something to do with recent warming, they'd be forced to explain what that was,
525240	529160	and that would mean tackling the science.
529160	533040	Researchers have found that increased solar activity, measured by sunspot numbers that
533040	538420	were observed at the time, was the most likely cause of the end of the Little Ice Age.
538420	542980	As you can see here, the increase in solar activity at the time correlates very well
542980	545560	with changes in global temperature.
545560	550600	The warming was possibly enhanced by a decrease in volcanic activity that reduced aerosol
550600	553880	concentration in the atmosphere.
553880	558300	But if the authors were to suggest that the same thing is happening now, their petition
558300	564560	would again be laughed at, because those factors clearly aren't responsible for recent warming.
564560	570280	For the last seven decades, solar irradiance has been stable and then falling, and aerosol
570280	576920	concentration has been increasing, thanks to the industrial rise of India and China.
576920	581360	If they suggest the warming was caused by changes in albedo or increased water vapour
581360	587200	concentration, then that's also very easily disproved, because of course these are passive
587200	590220	forcings – they're feedbacks.
590220	593620	Even climate science critics know that.
593620	596000	So instead, they don't explain anything.
596000	601140	They just add a few adverbs and conjunctions to known facts, string them together, and
601140	605780	hope the casual reader will get the impression that the Earth is warming now, due to the
605780	608140	same factors that ended the Little Ice Age.
608140	610300	And not as good as a wink to a blind bat.
610300	613380	And if he does, well, nothing to do with us, Gov.
613380	614900	No, no, no, no, no.
614900	620540	That's the difference between slickly worded petitions signed by lawyers aimed at politicians
620540	624340	and scientific papers aimed at research scientists.
624340	628460	Researchers have to spell out exactly what they're proposing, the method by which they
628460	631740	derived it, and any references they used.
631740	636760	They have to show their data, their evidence, their calculations, and their results, so
636760	642660	it can all be picked apart, scrutinised, and disproved if possible.
642660	644900	Political lobbyists do the complete opposite.
644900	647180	They daren't spell everything out.
647180	651700	By leaving everything vague and ambiguous, they're trying to avoid having their claims
651700	653820	scrutinised or challenged.
653820	659820	OK, let's press on to a claim made in the past by bloggers and lobbyists that CO2 is
659820	662180	too tiny to have any effect.
662180	667820	Why do we suppose that carbon dioxide is responsible for our changing climate?
667820	672920	CO2 forms only a very small part of the Earth's atmosphere.
672920	677020	Only 4% of our greenhouse gas is carbon dioxide.
677020	679660	It's an incredibly small portion.
679660	684340	Carbon dioxide is only a tiny trace gas in the atmosphere.
684340	694140	CO2 now occupies, get this, one ten-thousandth more of the atmosphere than it did in 1750.
694140	696940	That claim is also missing from the petition.
696940	700100	Instead, they argue the complete opposite.
700100	705020	It turns out that this teeny tiny trace gas can have huge effects.
705020	709220	CO2 is essential to all life on Earth, says the petition.
709220	715740	Not only that, the supposedly teeny tiny increase in this teeny tiny trace gas has promoted
715740	719420	growth in global plant biomass.
719420	723580	Which of course it has, as I've explained in my videos and researches have shown in
723580	725940	several studies.
725940	730780	So what happened to the people who thought that a teeny tiny increase in a teeny tiny
730780	733900	trace gas can't possibly have any effect?
733900	738340	Well, we've already seen that Christopher Monckton and Tim Ball have signed up to this
738340	744740	new reality, and yes, so has Jay Lehrer of the Heartland Institute.
744740	749580	The authors of the Declaration do manage to make a few claims very explicitly, without
749580	755820	innuendo, so consequently these can be pretty easily battered out of the ballpark.
755820	757460	Warming is slower than predicted.
757460	762980	The world has warmed significantly less than predicted by the IPCC on the basis of modelled
762980	765540	anthropogenic forcing.
765540	770580	The paragraph that follows also assumes the predictions were inaccurate.
770580	774780	Of course we only have to look at the predictions to see that that's nonsense.
774780	780220	In its first report, the IPCC used this forecast by James Hansen.
780220	782140	There were three scenarios.
782140	787020	Scenario A was based on no action to curb greenhouse emissions and therefore accelerating
787020	788940	CO2 growth.
788940	794340	Scenario B was based on limited action to curb CO2 emissions and linear growth.
794340	801300	And Scenario C was based on strong action to curb CO2 emissions and falling CO2 output.
801300	806420	Thanks to the Kyoto Protocol, what we got was linear growth in CO2 concentration, and
806420	810300	that matched Hansen's forecast pretty well.
810300	812940	But if you're not happy with that, fine.
812940	817380	This was the second IPCC forecast from 1995.
817380	820620	And this one from 2001.
820620	823660	And so on.
823660	828620	All the predictions pretty much match the temperature rise we've seen.
828620	832820	And even if you refuse to accept any of that and just want to focus on the estimate of
832820	838940	climate sensitivity that most results cluster around, a 3 degree centigrade rise for a doubling
838940	845300	of CO2 from pre-industrial levels, that prediction is also right on track.
845300	849860	These real predictions in the scientific literature, going back 40 years, have proved
849860	854580	far more accurate than the predictions of some of the signatories to the petition.
854580	859460	Just look at the contrast between James Hansen's prediction of average global temperatures
859460	861860	and Richard Lindzen's.
861860	866620	And what evidence do the authors of this petition present to back up their claim that warming
866620	869040	is far slower than predicted?
869040	872460	Of course, none at all.
872460	876860	Let's try another statement that actually does make a definitive claim.
876860	879620	Global warming has not increased natural disasters.
879620	884300	There's no statistical evidence that global warming is intensifying hurricanes, floods,
884300	890160	droughts, and such like natural disasters, or making them more frequent.
890160	893140	The obvious question is, how do you know?
893140	897860	Have the authors done a statistical study of all the hurricanes, floods, droughts, and
897860	903660	such like, and published their calculations to be read by all the signatories who unquestioningly
903660	905180	believed it?
905180	907620	If so, where's this study?
907620	910380	Well, no, they haven't.
910380	915380	So when they say there's no statistical evidence, it means they haven't seen any statistical
915380	921420	evidence and neither apparently have the 1,100 plus signatories who believe them.
921420	925940	They're just busy foresters or hardworking coal experts who can't be bothered to wade
925940	931640	through the scientific literature and find it easier just to put their names on a petition.
931640	935040	But it's really not that hard to find this evidence.
935040	939340	Just look at the intensity of hurricanes, because that's very easy to measure.
939340	943740	I found several studies showing that they have indeed grown more intense.
943740	948920	As for global warming making hurricanes more frequent, well, that's one of the effects
948920	955480	the authors of the Declaration seem to think has been predicted as a result of global warming.
955480	957100	But it hasn't.
957100	960980	Climate researchers have always predicted the opposite, that hurricanes would become
960980	966560	less frequent since global warming will reduce global wind circulation and this will increase
966560	971160	wind shear at the tops of hurricanes, chopping them off before they form.
971160	974560	Only the most intense storms will survive.
974560	977960	I covered this in a previous video.
977960	979540	So there's a lesson in this.
979540	984560	If you decide you want to oppose a scientific conclusion that you know very little about
984640	990600	and start a petition, the first step is to at least find out what the scientific conclusion is.
990600	995960	Otherwise you find yourself opposing something that doesn't even exist.
995960	999880	Now let's come back to those signatories, because I'm sure by now there'll be at least
999880	1002160	one post in the comments section saying,
1002160	1007400	But pothola, many of these signatories are actual climatologists.
1007400	1013520	Well, they've certainly got themselves lots of interesting titles that have the word climatologist in them.
1013520	1018600	Pavel Duder, excuse my pronunciation, must be a climatologist you'd think, because he
1018600	1020320	says he is.
1020320	1025760	But he also says he's a publicist and I can't find any record in the scientific literature
1025760	1029500	of a climatologist called Pavel Duder.
1029500	1033800	Lots of people seem to have given themselves the title of climate realist, which isn't
1033800	1037500	a climatologist and it isn't even a profession.
1037500	1042080	They seem to practice being a climate realist in their spare time because they have other
1042080	1044920	qualifications like urologist.
1044920	1049360	Oh I do beg your pardon, this guy is an informed climate realist.
1049360	1051520	That's alright then.
1051520	1055280	One guy calls himself a climate policy commentator.
1055280	1057960	Real job, anthropologist.
1057960	1061120	There are lots of people who belong to climate lobbying groups.
1061120	1064800	That still doesn't make them climatologists.
1064800	1070320	And being a building engineer who reads climate blogs doesn't make you a climate researcher,
1070560	1075560	even if you're so convinced you are one that you write it twice.
1075560	1080800	Okay you might say, but aren't geologists or geophysicists climatologists?
1080800	1082180	No of course not.
1082180	1086840	I checked the credentials of some of the geologists on the list and they're mostly involved in
1086840	1091920	mining geology or other fields like seismology or mineralogy.
1091920	1097360	Out of the entire list I could only find a handful who had any kind of relevant qualification
1097360	1100000	in the field of climatology.
1100000	1105560	Oh pothola, you may remonstrate, you're being an elitist, suggesting that only people with
1105560	1111400	relevant qualifications should get to sign a petition about a scientific conclusion.
1111400	1113960	No I'm not saying that at all.
1113960	1118880	First and foremost, people with relevant qualifications don't go around making vague insinuations
1118880	1122880	in a petition if they don't like a particular scientific theory.
1122880	1125100	That's not how science is done.
1125100	1129960	They publish their evidence clearly and precisely in scientific journals where it can be put
1129960	1132720	publicly scrutinized and disproved.
1132720	1137960	Secondly, if a group of doctors and architects don't like a particular scientific theory,
1137960	1139360	so what?
1139360	1143860	How is that different to regulars at the local pub deciding they disagree with the theory
1143860	1145400	of gravity?
1145400	1150240	Should politicians now make policy decisions about scientific issues like disease control
1150240	1155520	and earthquake mitigation based on what a bunch of pub-goers sign up to?
1155520	1159880	I'm also saying there's something far more interesting here than just a bunch of amateurs
1159880	1164040	deciding they're not happy with the conclusions of climate scientists.
1164040	1166280	We've seen that before.
1166280	1170000	What's different is a huge shift in position.
1170000	1174420	Many of the signatories are bloggers and lobbyists who've long disliked the conclusion that the
1174420	1180380	Earth is warming and that carbon dioxide is responsible, or even that it could warm.
1180500	1186900	None of those arguments is stated in this new petition, and most are completely contradicted.
1186900	1192100	And in place of doubt, which has been the mainstay of the anti-science lobby, from creationists
1192100	1199380	to tobacco firms to political groups, we now have something far more wussy – ambiguity.
1199380	1203900	Whereas before they would have wheeled out a few old retired climatologists to say maybe
1203900	1209020	all the other climatologists are wrong, now the best they can do is drop hints.
1209260	1211260	Look, are you trying to insinuate something?
1211260	1214860	No, no, no, no, no, no, no, yes.
1214860	1220260	I guess catching up to the science of 1955 is progress, right?
1220260	1222300	One last thing.
1222300	1227900	Of course, I don't monetise my channel, I don't ask for donations, but if you'd like
1227900	1234460	me to keep this channel going, I am very encouraged by donations given to a charity that I support.
1234460	1237380	You'll find all the details in the video description.
1237420	1242100	So, even if you don't want to help me out, at least please help the charity.
1242100	1242620	Thanks a lot.
