1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,000
Whoo! I am so excited, I am beside myself. I cannot believe what I'm seeing.

2
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:12,000
All right, I'll bite. Louis, what is it you're getting so excited about?

3
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:13,000
I'm so fired up!

4
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:20,000
Turns out Louis Giglio is getting excited about a protein called laminin, which binds other proteins together.

5
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:23,000
But I'll let him describe it in a slightly more theatrical way.

6
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:30,000
It's like the rebar of the human body. The steel they put in the concrete when they lay the foundations of things, it's that stuff.

7
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
It's holding your membranes together.

8
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:37,000
Look, I'm going to cut through all this crap and show you what Louis Giglio finally showed his audience.

9
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:40,000
And these little thumbnails come up on the screen and I'm like...

10
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:48,000
Wow! That's laminin?

11
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:51,000
Now I am as happy as a little girl.

12
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:55,000
I love laminin! I'm so fired up!

13
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:01,000
You should see laminin, I guess. That's the thing, right?

14
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:09,000
Okay, here is a scientific diagram of the laminin cell adhesion molecule that's holding your body together right now.

15
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:11,000
Okay, this is what I found right here.

16
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:17,000
They don't seem all that fired up, Louis.

17
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:21,000
No, come on, that's crazy! That's just crazy!

18
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,000
Oh yeah, that's better.

19
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:31,000
The reason the creationist crowd have to be told to get enthused is because, well, what the hell are we looking at?

20
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:35,000
Okay, it looks like a cross, but this is... what was it?

21
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:36,000
Scientific diagram!

22
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:39,000
That's right, it's a scientific diagram.

23
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:44,000
This isn't what laminin actually looks like any more than the London subway system looks like this.

24
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:47,000
It's just drawn this way to make it easier to visualise.

25
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:51,000
The actual laminin molecule doesn't look anything like that,

26
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:56,000
so surely Giglio won't dampen the enthusiasm even more by actually showing them one.

27
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,000
Well, yes, he does.

28
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:06,000
He sends me this image, an electron microscopic image of an actual laminin protein molecule.

29
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,000
It looks just like this.

30
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:12,000
They still don't give a flying f***, Louis.

31
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:15,000
But I can't say I blame them. What the hell is this?

32
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:17,000
How crazy is that?

33
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:22,000
That the stuff that holds our bodies together,

34
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:26,000
that's holding the lining of your organs together, holding your skin on,

35
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:31,000
is in the perfect shape of the cross of our Lord Jesus Christ.

36
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:35,000
It is? Well then, let's compare them.

37
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:39,000
I've heard a blind faith, but you can't be that blind, Louis.

38
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:42,000
This is nothing like the perfect shape of a cross.

39
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,000
And neither is this.

40
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:47,000
This is another photo of real, actual laminin.

41
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:49,000
And this.

42
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:53,000
And here's how laminin is usually represented as a scientific diagram.

43
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:56,000
Even by coveted Golden Crocoduck standards,

44
00:02:56,000 --> 00:03:00,000
this attempt to make people see something that just isn't there

45
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,000
requires gonads the size of basketballs.

46
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:07,000
It's not as if it's all that difficult to find much better crosses in nature, after all.

47
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:13,000
You can find crosses on the backs of toads, in spider's webs, and even in bananas.

48
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:15,000
And what about the man-made world?

49
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:21,000
Look at how God is spreading his message through railway tracks and Lego blocks.

50
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:24,000
Or maybe none of these things have been put there by Jesus.

51
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:27,000
We're predisposed to try and pick out shapes and things.

52
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:30,000
Take a look at this and tell me what you see.

53
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:41,000
Don't get upset with me for that. I'm just showing you a dog's bottom.

54
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:46,000
If you saw something that wasn't there, that's entirely the fault of your wild imagination.

55
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:49,000
And anyway, Louis, what's all this supposed to mean?

56
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:53,000
Are you suggesting your God couldn't be bothered to eliminate genetic defects?

57
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:57,000
But he thought it would be hugely fun to make billions of little proteins

58
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:00,000
that sort of looked like misshapen crosses,

59
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:03,000
and spider's webs and the insides of bananas.

60
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:06,000
Has he really planted all these silly images?

61
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:09,000
Or are we just seeing things that aren't there?
