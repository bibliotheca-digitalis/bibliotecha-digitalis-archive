0	8000	Whoo! I am so excited, I am beside myself. I cannot believe what I'm seeing.
8000	12000	All right, I'll bite. Louis, what is it you're getting so excited about?
12000	13000	I'm so fired up!
13000	20000	Turns out Louis Giglio is getting excited about a protein called laminin, which binds other proteins together.
20000	23000	But I'll let him describe it in a slightly more theatrical way.
23000	30000	It's like the rebar of the human body. The steel they put in the concrete when they lay the foundations of things, it's that stuff.
30000	32000	It's holding your membranes together.
32000	37000	Look, I'm going to cut through all this crap and show you what Louis Giglio finally showed his audience.
37000	40000	And these little thumbnails come up on the screen and I'm like...
44000	48000	Wow! That's laminin?
48000	51000	Now I am as happy as a little girl.
51000	55000	I love laminin! I'm so fired up!
58000	61000	You should see laminin, I guess. That's the thing, right?
61000	69000	Okay, here is a scientific diagram of the laminin cell adhesion molecule that's holding your body together right now.
69000	71000	Okay, this is what I found right here.
74000	77000	They don't seem all that fired up, Louis.
77000	81000	No, come on, that's crazy! That's just crazy!
82000	84000	Oh yeah, that's better.
84000	91000	The reason the creationist crowd have to be told to get enthused is because, well, what the hell are we looking at?
91000	95000	Okay, it looks like a cross, but this is... what was it?
95000	96000	Scientific diagram!
96000	99000	That's right, it's a scientific diagram.
99000	104000	This isn't what laminin actually looks like any more than the London subway system looks like this.
104000	107000	It's just drawn this way to make it easier to visualise.
107000	111000	The actual laminin molecule doesn't look anything like that,
111000	116000	so surely Giglio won't dampen the enthusiasm even more by actually showing them one.
116000	118000	Well, yes, he does.
118000	126000	He sends me this image, an electron microscopic image of an actual laminin protein molecule.
126000	128000	It looks just like this.
129000	132000	They still don't give a flying f***, Louis.
132000	135000	But I can't say I blame them. What the hell is this?
135000	137000	How crazy is that?
137000	142000	That the stuff that holds our bodies together,
142000	146000	that's holding the lining of your organs together, holding your skin on,
146000	151000	is in the perfect shape of the cross of our Lord Jesus Christ.
151000	155000	It is? Well then, let's compare them.
156000	159000	I've heard a blind faith, but you can't be that blind, Louis.
159000	162000	This is nothing like the perfect shape of a cross.
162000	164000	And neither is this.
164000	167000	This is another photo of real, actual laminin.
167000	169000	And this.
169000	173000	And here's how laminin is usually represented as a scientific diagram.
173000	176000	Even by coveted Golden Crocoduck standards,
176000	180000	this attempt to make people see something that just isn't there
180000	182000	requires gonads the size of basketballs.
182000	187000	It's not as if it's all that difficult to find much better crosses in nature, after all.
187000	193000	You can find crosses on the backs of toads, in spider's webs, and even in bananas.
193000	195000	And what about the man-made world?
195000	201000	Look at how God is spreading his message through railway tracks and Lego blocks.
201000	204000	Or maybe none of these things have been put there by Jesus.
204000	207000	We're predisposed to try and pick out shapes and things.
207000	210000	Take a look at this and tell me what you see.
218000	221000	Don't get upset with me for that. I'm just showing you a dog's bottom.
221000	226000	If you saw something that wasn't there, that's entirely the fault of your wild imagination.
226000	229000	And anyway, Louis, what's all this supposed to mean?
229000	233000	Are you suggesting your God couldn't be bothered to eliminate genetic defects?
233000	237000	But he thought it would be hugely fun to make billions of little proteins
237000	240000	that sort of looked like misshapen crosses,
240000	243000	and spider's webs and the insides of bananas.
243000	246000	Has he really planted all these silly images?
246000	249000	Or are we just seeing things that aren't there?
