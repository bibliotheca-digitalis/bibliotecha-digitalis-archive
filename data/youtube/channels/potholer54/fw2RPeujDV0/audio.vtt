00:00.000 --> 00:08.000
Whoo! I am so excited, I am beside myself. I cannot believe what I'm seeing.

00:08.000 --> 00:12.000
All right, I'll bite. Louis, what is it you're getting so excited about?

00:12.000 --> 00:13.000
I'm so fired up!

00:13.000 --> 00:20.000
Turns out Louis Giglio is getting excited about a protein called laminin, which binds other proteins together.

00:20.000 --> 00:23.000
But I'll let him describe it in a slightly more theatrical way.

00:23.000 --> 00:30.000
It's like the rebar of the human body. The steel they put in the concrete when they lay the foundations of things, it's that stuff.

00:30.000 --> 00:32.000
It's holding your membranes together.

00:32.000 --> 00:37.000
Look, I'm going to cut through all this crap and show you what Louis Giglio finally showed his audience.

00:37.000 --> 00:40.000
And these little thumbnails come up on the screen and I'm like...

00:44.000 --> 00:48.000
Wow! That's laminin?

00:48.000 --> 00:51.000
Now I am as happy as a little girl.

00:51.000 --> 00:55.000
I love laminin! I'm so fired up!

00:58.000 --> 01:01.000
You should see laminin, I guess. That's the thing, right?

01:01.000 --> 01:09.000
Okay, here is a scientific diagram of the laminin cell adhesion molecule that's holding your body together right now.

01:09.000 --> 01:11.000
Okay, this is what I found right here.

01:14.000 --> 01:17.000
They don't seem all that fired up, Louis.

01:17.000 --> 01:21.000
No, come on, that's crazy! That's just crazy!

01:22.000 --> 01:24.000
Oh yeah, that's better.

01:24.000 --> 01:31.000
The reason the creationist crowd have to be told to get enthused is because, well, what the hell are we looking at?

01:31.000 --> 01:35.000
Okay, it looks like a cross, but this is... what was it?

01:35.000 --> 01:36.000
Scientific diagram!

01:36.000 --> 01:39.000
That's right, it's a scientific diagram.

01:39.000 --> 01:44.000
This isn't what laminin actually looks like any more than the London subway system looks like this.

01:44.000 --> 01:47.000
It's just drawn this way to make it easier to visualise.

01:47.000 --> 01:51.000
The actual laminin molecule doesn't look anything like that,

01:51.000 --> 01:56.000
so surely Giglio won't dampen the enthusiasm even more by actually showing them one.

01:56.000 --> 01:58.000
Well, yes, he does.

01:58.000 --> 02:06.000
He sends me this image, an electron microscopic image of an actual laminin protein molecule.

02:06.000 --> 02:08.000
It looks just like this.

02:09.000 --> 02:12.000
They still don't give a flying f***, Louis.

02:12.000 --> 02:15.000
But I can't say I blame them. What the hell is this?

02:15.000 --> 02:17.000
How crazy is that?

02:17.000 --> 02:22.000
That the stuff that holds our bodies together,

02:22.000 --> 02:26.000
that's holding the lining of your organs together, holding your skin on,

02:26.000 --> 02:31.000
is in the perfect shape of the cross of our Lord Jesus Christ.

02:31.000 --> 02:35.000
It is? Well then, let's compare them.

02:36.000 --> 02:39.000
I've heard a blind faith, but you can't be that blind, Louis.

02:39.000 --> 02:42.000
This is nothing like the perfect shape of a cross.

02:42.000 --> 02:44.000
And neither is this.

02:44.000 --> 02:47.000
This is another photo of real, actual laminin.

02:47.000 --> 02:49.000
And this.

02:49.000 --> 02:53.000
And here's how laminin is usually represented as a scientific diagram.

02:53.000 --> 02:56.000
Even by coveted Golden Crocoduck standards,

02:56.000 --> 03:00.000
this attempt to make people see something that just isn't there

03:00.000 --> 03:02.000
requires gonads the size of basketballs.

03:02.000 --> 03:07.000
It's not as if it's all that difficult to find much better crosses in nature, after all.

03:07.000 --> 03:13.000
You can find crosses on the backs of toads, in spider's webs, and even in bananas.

03:13.000 --> 03:15.000
And what about the man-made world?

03:15.000 --> 03:21.000
Look at how God is spreading his message through railway tracks and Lego blocks.

03:21.000 --> 03:24.000
Or maybe none of these things have been put there by Jesus.

03:24.000 --> 03:27.000
We're predisposed to try and pick out shapes and things.

03:27.000 --> 03:30.000
Take a look at this and tell me what you see.

03:38.000 --> 03:41.000
Don't get upset with me for that. I'm just showing you a dog's bottom.

03:41.000 --> 03:46.000
If you saw something that wasn't there, that's entirely the fault of your wild imagination.

03:46.000 --> 03:49.000
And anyway, Louis, what's all this supposed to mean?

03:49.000 --> 03:53.000
Are you suggesting your God couldn't be bothered to eliminate genetic defects?

03:53.000 --> 03:57.000
But he thought it would be hugely fun to make billions of little proteins

03:57.000 --> 04:00.000
that sort of looked like misshapen crosses,

04:00.000 --> 04:03.000
and spider's webs and the insides of bananas.

04:03.000 --> 04:06.000
Has he really planted all these silly images?

04:06.000 --> 04:09.000
Or are we just seeing things that aren't there?
