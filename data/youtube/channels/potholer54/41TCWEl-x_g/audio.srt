1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,960
Was referred to a video by a youtuber called the academic agent in which he asked for my help in solving a mystery

2
00:00:07,620 --> 00:00:14,900
So I thought this would make an interesting object lesson in how facts get distorted on the vlogger sphere and how to fact-check

3
00:00:15,840 --> 00:00:23,080
Let me start by saying that I like academic agent and not just because he uses the wonderful George Sanders as his icon

4
00:00:23,440 --> 00:00:27,620
He does repeat a lot of the nonsense about climate change found on the internet

5
00:00:27,900 --> 00:00:33,220
But he has shown a willingness in the past to listen when evidence contradicts his assumptions

6
00:00:33,580 --> 00:00:35,740
So I'm sure he'll do the same here

7
00:00:35,740 --> 00:00:42,240
I have a question to ask you the question is about whether the Maldives are going to be inundated by rising sea levels

8
00:00:43,340 --> 00:00:48,380
Scientists have been giving grave warnings about the Maldives for many years in 1988

9
00:00:48,380 --> 00:00:54,980
They predicted that it may be submerged in 30 years time academic agent says scientists predicted

10
00:00:55,100 --> 00:01:01,420
But this isn't a scientific paper, it's a newspaper report the article doesn't quote a scientist

11
00:01:01,420 --> 00:01:03,460
It quotes a government bureaucrat

12
00:01:03,980 --> 00:01:10,060
So if we're going to look at what scientists predicted then we need to look at what scientists predicted

13
00:01:10,900 --> 00:01:12,900
remarkably in

14
00:01:13,140 --> 00:01:14,500
2018

15
00:01:14,500 --> 00:01:21,180
After this prediction had not come to pass just a reminder. This wasn't a prediction by scientists scientists again

16
00:01:21,660 --> 00:01:23,660
Predicted that the Maldives could become

17
00:01:24,500 --> 00:01:28,800
Uninhabitable in 30 years, but again, this is a newspaper report

18
00:01:28,980 --> 00:01:35,860
So again, we have to check to find out what scientists predicted because believe it or not tabloid newspapers

19
00:01:35,860 --> 00:01:39,820
Don't always accurately report the contents of scientific studies

20
00:01:40,180 --> 00:01:44,660
The mail doesn't even cite its source, but it does give a keyword and a date

21
00:01:44,900 --> 00:01:50,980
so it's not hard to search Google Scholar for the word Roy Namur and find the relevant paper and

22
00:01:51,420 --> 00:01:57,380
It's quickly apparent that it doesn't say the Maldives will become uninhabitable by 2030 at all

23
00:01:58,060 --> 00:02:01,740
First of all, it was looking at the Marshall Islands not the Maldives

24
00:02:02,260 --> 00:02:07,560
The study looks at two different issues. The first is the issue of potable drinking water

25
00:02:08,180 --> 00:02:14,780
As sea levels rise saltwater is intruding into the fresh groundwater making it increasingly salty

26
00:02:15,380 --> 00:02:18,020
the paper predicts that between 2030 and

27
00:02:18,700 --> 00:02:23,140
2065 the groundwater in many atolls will be too salty to drink

28
00:02:24,100 --> 00:02:30,820
The range of dates reflects three different scenarios depending on how much action is taken to curb co2 emissions

29
00:02:31,620 --> 00:02:37,480
2030 is the least likely date because it envisages no action at all on climate change

30
00:02:38,200 --> 00:02:44,460
The mail gave the correct range predicted by the study more or less but typical of a tabloid newspaper

31
00:02:44,540 --> 00:02:50,660
The mail chose to put the least likely date in the headline because it's the most dramatic and

32
00:02:50,980 --> 00:02:54,660
That's the date the academic agent picked up on scientists again

33
00:02:55,340 --> 00:02:59,740
Predicted that the Maldives could become uninhabitable in 30 years

34
00:02:59,740 --> 00:03:07,420
In fact, the study says a lack of potable water could be overcome by desalination or transport of freshwater from elsewhere

35
00:03:07,820 --> 00:03:12,300
But a bigger problem will be storm surges which flood the islands with saltwater

36
00:03:13,260 --> 00:03:16,660
As sea levels rise these will become annual events between

37
00:03:17,340 --> 00:03:18,900
2055 and

38
00:03:18,900 --> 00:03:25,240
2105 the conclusion is that many atolls will remain suitable for human habitation until

39
00:03:25,940 --> 00:03:27,380
2100 or

40
00:03:27,380 --> 00:03:28,420
2150

41
00:03:28,420 --> 00:03:32,640
This isn't just in the body of the study. It's right there in the title

42
00:03:33,740 --> 00:03:36,900
but the mail took this issue of uninhabitability or

43
00:03:37,420 --> 00:03:44,020
Human inhabitants as it calls it and applied it to the earliest date for salty drinking water

44
00:03:44,820 --> 00:03:49,520
The study didn't look at the question of permanent inundation by rising sea levels

45
00:03:49,900 --> 00:03:54,900
But it said that other studies had predicted this wouldn't happen until at least the end of this century

46
00:03:56,100 --> 00:04:01,740
The academic agent however, not only said that the islands would be uninhabitable by 2030

47
00:04:01,980 --> 00:04:06,020
He went on to claim they'd be completely submerged by 2030

48
00:04:06,620 --> 00:04:12,700
Something even the Mail Online didn't suggest given that the Maldives may be under the sea by the year 2030

49
00:04:13,020 --> 00:04:19,380
This is typical of the way information passes around the internet in a kind of virtual telephone game a

50
00:04:19,940 --> 00:04:26,800
Study says water supplies on the island will become too salty to drink sometime between 2030 and 2065

51
00:04:27,700 --> 00:04:31,460
then suffer increasingly frequent storm surges between

52
00:04:32,020 --> 00:04:33,340
2060 to

53
00:04:33,340 --> 00:04:40,660
2105 then become uninhabitable and eventually submerged by rising sea levels after 2100

54
00:04:41,460 --> 00:04:48,240
The Daily Mail picks up bits of this to report that the Maldive Islands will be uninhabitable by 2030 to

55
00:04:48,540 --> 00:04:52,940
2060 and a headline that says this is likely to happen in 2030

56
00:04:53,580 --> 00:05:00,580
And the academic agent picks up bits of the mail story to report that the Maldives will be underwater by 2030

57
00:05:01,500 --> 00:05:08,060
To cap it all the only mention of the Maldives in the study was among a list of islands for which the study's findings are

58
00:05:08,380 --> 00:05:09,860
relevant

59
00:05:09,860 --> 00:05:15,140
Now there are some confusing aspects to this for starters in

60
00:05:16,260 --> 00:05:18,260
2015 in the New Scientist

61
00:05:18,380 --> 00:05:25,300
Some experts walked back the claim and said that the assholes may actually grow in the coming years

62
00:05:25,620 --> 00:05:31,340
Two years later in the same publication. They went back to the original claim that the Maldives was under

63
00:05:31,460 --> 00:05:33,460
grave threat in

64
00:05:33,820 --> 00:05:35,300
2018

65
00:05:35,300 --> 00:05:41,260
Phys.org repeated the claim that climate change may actually help to grow the assholes

66
00:05:41,260 --> 00:05:43,260
But no one's walked back any claims

67
00:05:43,540 --> 00:05:48,780
There's nothing contradictory about studies that show increasing salination and storm surges

68
00:05:49,300 --> 00:05:56,220
alongside studies that show increasing at all sighs because they're all happening and they've all been reported and

69
00:05:56,420 --> 00:05:58,740
predicted in scientific journals for decades

70
00:05:59,420 --> 00:06:04,580
In fact I covered this in my video climate change hurricanes atolls and coral reefs

71
00:06:04,860 --> 00:06:10,440
Dead coral either broken off by wave action or marine organisms builds up to form an island

72
00:06:10,440 --> 00:06:12,940
And it's still building these islands today

73
00:06:13,460 --> 00:06:21,140
This isn't exactly news the process was first postulated by Charles Darwin and a number of papers have been published over the decades

74
00:06:21,580 --> 00:06:25,900
Documenting the continuing growth of these islands although research continues

75
00:06:25,940 --> 00:06:31,740
There's as yet little evidence that the expected rate of sea level rise will reverse that in

76
00:06:32,220 --> 00:06:37,300
2010 Arthur Webb and Paul Kench analyzed hundreds of historical aerial photographs and

77
00:06:37,580 --> 00:06:43,860
Confirmed that 23 out of 27 Pacific atolls are indeed either stable or growing in size

78
00:06:44,540 --> 00:06:46,460
including Tuvalu

79
00:06:46,460 --> 00:06:50,200
So why do climate scientists insist that these islands face problems?

80
00:06:50,480 --> 00:06:57,880
Well the problems are related to other issues caused by climate change such as storm surges coastal erosion and saline intrusion

81
00:06:58,400 --> 00:07:01,120
Not total submergence from rising seas

82
00:07:01,520 --> 00:07:07,360
But of course the stability of the islands depends on the continuing health of the coral reefs and as coral reefs

83
00:07:07,480 --> 00:07:13,760
Continue to die because of rising water temperature the protection and growth they afford will diminish

84
00:07:14,200 --> 00:07:21,160
In fact this is explained in the very articles academic agent sites and the studies on which they're based

85
00:07:21,680 --> 00:07:24,440
It's just a question of reading beyond the headlines

86
00:07:25,040 --> 00:07:30,160
So now that we understand the premise is wrong the rest is pretty easy to straighten out

87
00:07:30,160 --> 00:07:37,000
This narrative is so well-worn that it has even made it onto the GCSE science syllabus

88
00:07:37,200 --> 00:07:42,200
For non British viewers. That's a core curriculum exam taken by all

89
00:07:42,680 --> 00:07:49,200
16 year olds in this country and quite right too because that's what schools teach science

90
00:07:49,840 --> 00:07:56,980
We may not live to see the year 2060, but children of today will they'll be the scientists economists and administrators

91
00:07:57,400 --> 00:08:04,480
Of the future who'll have to deal with salination and annual storm surges and the dislocation of island populations

92
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:08,080
So what could possibly be wrong with teaching this in school?

93
00:08:08,680 --> 00:08:11,360
Not in an alarmist or emotional way

94
00:08:11,520 --> 00:08:18,320
But as sound practical academic study foreign direct investment in the Maldives has more than quadrupled

95
00:08:18,920 --> 00:08:20,920
since the year 2000

96
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:26,000
This is very strange behavior from people betting with their own money

97
00:08:26,360 --> 00:08:32,640
Don't they know that their money will be under the sea before long, but of course anyone who checks this claim

98
00:08:33,080 --> 00:08:36,280
Including the smart investor knows that that's nonsense

99
00:08:37,040 --> 00:08:43,400
Before long is actually decades away and that's more than enough time to see the fruits of an investment

100
00:08:44,080 --> 00:08:49,400
After all all assets will depreciate over time with or without sea level rise

101
00:08:49,920 --> 00:08:55,920
So to reap the rewards of an investment you either need enough time to see profitability outstripped

102
00:08:56,320 --> 00:09:01,600
appreciation or you need to know that when you sell the investment years from now even with the era of

103
00:09:02,120 --> 00:09:05,200
Undrinkable water and annual inundation getting closer

104
00:09:05,520 --> 00:09:08,860
You'll be able to offload it onto the second type of investor

105
00:09:09,120 --> 00:09:15,160
People who don't bother to fact-check and who believe that this wild and implausible claim the Maldives

106
00:09:15,320 --> 00:09:20,720
May be under the sea by the year 2030 is actually a scientific prediction

107
00:09:21,140 --> 00:09:22,560
So 20 years from now

108
00:09:22,560 --> 00:09:24,960
They'll be very happy to invest in the Maldives

109
00:09:25,320 --> 00:09:32,240
Despite scientific predictions about salty drinking water on the grounds that predictions about the Maldives going underwater by

110
00:09:32,480 --> 00:09:34,760
2030 turned out not to be true

111
00:09:35,400 --> 00:09:40,120
Most of them won't even bother watching this video showing that no such prediction was made

112
00:09:43,120 --> 00:09:44,280
Well, yes

113
00:09:44,280 --> 00:09:47,920
But the real Maldives mystery is why so many self-professed

114
00:09:48,440 --> 00:09:53,320
Skeptics who watched the video didn't bother to spend just a few minutes fact-checking

115
00:09:53,940 --> 00:09:56,480
To find out whether any of this was true
