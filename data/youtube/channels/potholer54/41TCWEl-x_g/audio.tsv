0	6960	Was referred to a video by a youtuber called the academic agent in which he asked for my help in solving a mystery
7620	14900	So I thought this would make an interesting object lesson in how facts get distorted on the vlogger sphere and how to fact-check
15840	23080	Let me start by saying that I like academic agent and not just because he uses the wonderful George Sanders as his icon
23440	27620	He does repeat a lot of the nonsense about climate change found on the internet
27900	33220	But he has shown a willingness in the past to listen when evidence contradicts his assumptions
33580	35740	So I'm sure he'll do the same here
35740	42240	I have a question to ask you the question is about whether the Maldives are going to be inundated by rising sea levels
43340	48380	Scientists have been giving grave warnings about the Maldives for many years in 1988
48380	54980	They predicted that it may be submerged in 30 years time academic agent says scientists predicted
55100	61420	But this isn't a scientific paper, it's a newspaper report the article doesn't quote a scientist
61420	63460	It quotes a government bureaucrat
63980	70060	So if we're going to look at what scientists predicted then we need to look at what scientists predicted
70900	72900	remarkably in
73140	74500	2018
74500	81180	After this prediction had not come to pass just a reminder. This wasn't a prediction by scientists scientists again
81660	83660	Predicted that the Maldives could become
84500	88800	Uninhabitable in 30 years, but again, this is a newspaper report
88980	95860	So again, we have to check to find out what scientists predicted because believe it or not tabloid newspapers
95860	99820	Don't always accurately report the contents of scientific studies
100180	104660	The mail doesn't even cite its source, but it does give a keyword and a date
104900	110980	so it's not hard to search Google Scholar for the word Roy Namur and find the relevant paper and
111420	117380	It's quickly apparent that it doesn't say the Maldives will become uninhabitable by 2030 at all
118060	121740	First of all, it was looking at the Marshall Islands not the Maldives
122260	127560	The study looks at two different issues. The first is the issue of potable drinking water
128180	134780	As sea levels rise saltwater is intruding into the fresh groundwater making it increasingly salty
135380	138020	the paper predicts that between 2030 and
138700	143140	2065 the groundwater in many atolls will be too salty to drink
144100	150820	The range of dates reflects three different scenarios depending on how much action is taken to curb co2 emissions
151620	157480	2030 is the least likely date because it envisages no action at all on climate change
158200	164460	The mail gave the correct range predicted by the study more or less but typical of a tabloid newspaper
164540	170660	The mail chose to put the least likely date in the headline because it's the most dramatic and
170980	174660	That's the date the academic agent picked up on scientists again
175340	179740	Predicted that the Maldives could become uninhabitable in 30 years
179740	187420	In fact, the study says a lack of potable water could be overcome by desalination or transport of freshwater from elsewhere
187820	192300	But a bigger problem will be storm surges which flood the islands with saltwater
193260	196660	As sea levels rise these will become annual events between
197340	198900	2055 and
198900	205240	2105 the conclusion is that many atolls will remain suitable for human habitation until
205940	207380	2100 or
207380	208420	2150
208420	212640	This isn't just in the body of the study. It's right there in the title
213740	216900	but the mail took this issue of uninhabitability or
217420	224020	Human inhabitants as it calls it and applied it to the earliest date for salty drinking water
224820	229520	The study didn't look at the question of permanent inundation by rising sea levels
229900	234900	But it said that other studies had predicted this wouldn't happen until at least the end of this century
236100	241740	The academic agent however, not only said that the islands would be uninhabitable by 2030
241980	246020	He went on to claim they'd be completely submerged by 2030
246620	252700	Something even the Mail Online didn't suggest given that the Maldives may be under the sea by the year 2030
253020	259380	This is typical of the way information passes around the internet in a kind of virtual telephone game a
259940	266800	Study says water supplies on the island will become too salty to drink sometime between 2030 and 2065
267700	271460	then suffer increasingly frequent storm surges between
272020	273340	2060 to
273340	280660	2105 then become uninhabitable and eventually submerged by rising sea levels after 2100
281460	288240	The Daily Mail picks up bits of this to report that the Maldive Islands will be uninhabitable by 2030 to
288540	292940	2060 and a headline that says this is likely to happen in 2030
293580	300580	And the academic agent picks up bits of the mail story to report that the Maldives will be underwater by 2030
301500	308060	To cap it all the only mention of the Maldives in the study was among a list of islands for which the study's findings are
308380	309860	relevant
309860	315140	Now there are some confusing aspects to this for starters in
316260	318260	2015 in the New Scientist
318380	325300	Some experts walked back the claim and said that the assholes may actually grow in the coming years
325620	331340	Two years later in the same publication. They went back to the original claim that the Maldives was under
331460	333460	grave threat in
333820	335300	2018
335300	341260	Phys.org repeated the claim that climate change may actually help to grow the assholes
341260	343260	But no one's walked back any claims
343540	348780	There's nothing contradictory about studies that show increasing salination and storm surges
349300	356220	alongside studies that show increasing at all sighs because they're all happening and they've all been reported and
356420	358740	predicted in scientific journals for decades
359420	364580	In fact I covered this in my video climate change hurricanes atolls and coral reefs
364860	370440	Dead coral either broken off by wave action or marine organisms builds up to form an island
370440	372940	And it's still building these islands today
373460	381140	This isn't exactly news the process was first postulated by Charles Darwin and a number of papers have been published over the decades
381580	385900	Documenting the continuing growth of these islands although research continues
385940	391740	There's as yet little evidence that the expected rate of sea level rise will reverse that in
392220	397300	2010 Arthur Webb and Paul Kench analyzed hundreds of historical aerial photographs and
397580	403860	Confirmed that 23 out of 27 Pacific atolls are indeed either stable or growing in size
404540	406460	including Tuvalu
406460	410200	So why do climate scientists insist that these islands face problems?
410480	417880	Well the problems are related to other issues caused by climate change such as storm surges coastal erosion and saline intrusion
418400	421120	Not total submergence from rising seas
421520	427360	But of course the stability of the islands depends on the continuing health of the coral reefs and as coral reefs
427480	433760	Continue to die because of rising water temperature the protection and growth they afford will diminish
434200	441160	In fact this is explained in the very articles academic agent sites and the studies on which they're based
441680	444440	It's just a question of reading beyond the headlines
445040	450160	So now that we understand the premise is wrong the rest is pretty easy to straighten out
450160	457000	This narrative is so well-worn that it has even made it onto the GCSE science syllabus
457200	462200	For non British viewers. That's a core curriculum exam taken by all
462680	469200	16 year olds in this country and quite right too because that's what schools teach science
469840	476980	We may not live to see the year 2060, but children of today will they'll be the scientists economists and administrators
477400	484480	Of the future who'll have to deal with salination and annual storm surges and the dislocation of island populations
484800	488080	So what could possibly be wrong with teaching this in school?
488680	491360	Not in an alarmist or emotional way
491520	498320	But as sound practical academic study foreign direct investment in the Maldives has more than quadrupled
498920	500920	since the year 2000
501000	506000	This is very strange behavior from people betting with their own money
506360	512640	Don't they know that their money will be under the sea before long, but of course anyone who checks this claim
513080	516280	Including the smart investor knows that that's nonsense
517040	523400	Before long is actually decades away and that's more than enough time to see the fruits of an investment
524080	529400	After all all assets will depreciate over time with or without sea level rise
529920	535920	So to reap the rewards of an investment you either need enough time to see profitability outstripped
536320	541600	appreciation or you need to know that when you sell the investment years from now even with the era of
542120	545200	Undrinkable water and annual inundation getting closer
545520	548860	You'll be able to offload it onto the second type of investor
549120	555160	People who don't bother to fact-check and who believe that this wild and implausible claim the Maldives
555320	560720	May be under the sea by the year 2030 is actually a scientific prediction
561140	562560	So 20 years from now
562560	564960	They'll be very happy to invest in the Maldives
565320	572240	Despite scientific predictions about salty drinking water on the grounds that predictions about the Maldives going underwater by
572480	574760	2030 turned out not to be true
575400	580120	Most of them won't even bother watching this video showing that no such prediction was made
583120	584280	Well, yes
584280	587920	But the real Maldives mystery is why so many self-professed
588440	593320	Skeptics who watched the video didn't bother to spend just a few minutes fact-checking
593940	596480	To find out whether any of this was true
