00:00.000 --> 00:06.960
Was referred to a video by a youtuber called the academic agent in which he asked for my help in solving a mystery

00:07.620 --> 00:14.900
So I thought this would make an interesting object lesson in how facts get distorted on the vlogger sphere and how to fact-check

00:15.840 --> 00:23.080
Let me start by saying that I like academic agent and not just because he uses the wonderful George Sanders as his icon

00:23.440 --> 00:27.620
He does repeat a lot of the nonsense about climate change found on the internet

00:27.900 --> 00:33.220
But he has shown a willingness in the past to listen when evidence contradicts his assumptions

00:33.580 --> 00:35.740
So I'm sure he'll do the same here

00:35.740 --> 00:42.240
I have a question to ask you the question is about whether the Maldives are going to be inundated by rising sea levels

00:43.340 --> 00:48.380
Scientists have been giving grave warnings about the Maldives for many years in 1988

00:48.380 --> 00:54.980
They predicted that it may be submerged in 30 years time academic agent says scientists predicted

00:55.100 --> 01:01.420
But this isn't a scientific paper, it's a newspaper report the article doesn't quote a scientist

01:01.420 --> 01:03.460
It quotes a government bureaucrat

01:03.980 --> 01:10.060
So if we're going to look at what scientists predicted then we need to look at what scientists predicted

01:10.900 --> 01:12.900
remarkably in

01:13.140 --> 01:14.500
2018

01:14.500 --> 01:21.180
After this prediction had not come to pass just a reminder. This wasn't a prediction by scientists scientists again

01:21.660 --> 01:23.660
Predicted that the Maldives could become

01:24.500 --> 01:28.800
Uninhabitable in 30 years, but again, this is a newspaper report

01:28.980 --> 01:35.860
So again, we have to check to find out what scientists predicted because believe it or not tabloid newspapers

01:35.860 --> 01:39.820
Don't always accurately report the contents of scientific studies

01:40.180 --> 01:44.660
The mail doesn't even cite its source, but it does give a keyword and a date

01:44.900 --> 01:50.980
so it's not hard to search Google Scholar for the word Roy Namur and find the relevant paper and

01:51.420 --> 01:57.380
It's quickly apparent that it doesn't say the Maldives will become uninhabitable by 2030 at all

01:58.060 --> 02:01.740
First of all, it was looking at the Marshall Islands not the Maldives

02:02.260 --> 02:07.560
The study looks at two different issues. The first is the issue of potable drinking water

02:08.180 --> 02:14.780
As sea levels rise saltwater is intruding into the fresh groundwater making it increasingly salty

02:15.380 --> 02:18.020
the paper predicts that between 2030 and

02:18.700 --> 02:23.140
2065 the groundwater in many atolls will be too salty to drink

02:24.100 --> 02:30.820
The range of dates reflects three different scenarios depending on how much action is taken to curb co2 emissions

02:31.620 --> 02:37.480
2030 is the least likely date because it envisages no action at all on climate change

02:38.200 --> 02:44.460
The mail gave the correct range predicted by the study more or less but typical of a tabloid newspaper

02:44.540 --> 02:50.660
The mail chose to put the least likely date in the headline because it's the most dramatic and

02:50.980 --> 02:54.660
That's the date the academic agent picked up on scientists again

02:55.340 --> 02:59.740
Predicted that the Maldives could become uninhabitable in 30 years

02:59.740 --> 03:07.420
In fact, the study says a lack of potable water could be overcome by desalination or transport of freshwater from elsewhere

03:07.820 --> 03:12.300
But a bigger problem will be storm surges which flood the islands with saltwater

03:13.260 --> 03:16.660
As sea levels rise these will become annual events between

03:17.340 --> 03:18.900
2055 and

03:18.900 --> 03:25.240
2105 the conclusion is that many atolls will remain suitable for human habitation until

03:25.940 --> 03:27.380
2100 or

03:27.380 --> 03:28.420
2150

03:28.420 --> 03:32.640
This isn't just in the body of the study. It's right there in the title

03:33.740 --> 03:36.900
but the mail took this issue of uninhabitability or

03:37.420 --> 03:44.020
Human inhabitants as it calls it and applied it to the earliest date for salty drinking water

03:44.820 --> 03:49.520
The study didn't look at the question of permanent inundation by rising sea levels

03:49.900 --> 03:54.900
But it said that other studies had predicted this wouldn't happen until at least the end of this century

03:56.100 --> 04:01.740
The academic agent however, not only said that the islands would be uninhabitable by 2030

04:01.980 --> 04:06.020
He went on to claim they'd be completely submerged by 2030

04:06.620 --> 04:12.700
Something even the Mail Online didn't suggest given that the Maldives may be under the sea by the year 2030

04:13.020 --> 04:19.380
This is typical of the way information passes around the internet in a kind of virtual telephone game a

04:19.940 --> 04:26.800
Study says water supplies on the island will become too salty to drink sometime between 2030 and 2065

04:27.700 --> 04:31.460
then suffer increasingly frequent storm surges between

04:32.020 --> 04:33.340
2060 to

04:33.340 --> 04:40.660
2105 then become uninhabitable and eventually submerged by rising sea levels after 2100

04:41.460 --> 04:48.240
The Daily Mail picks up bits of this to report that the Maldive Islands will be uninhabitable by 2030 to

04:48.540 --> 04:52.940
2060 and a headline that says this is likely to happen in 2030

04:53.580 --> 05:00.580
And the academic agent picks up bits of the mail story to report that the Maldives will be underwater by 2030

05:01.500 --> 05:08.060
To cap it all the only mention of the Maldives in the study was among a list of islands for which the study's findings are

05:08.380 --> 05:09.860
relevant

05:09.860 --> 05:15.140
Now there are some confusing aspects to this for starters in

05:16.260 --> 05:18.260
2015 in the New Scientist

05:18.380 --> 05:25.300
Some experts walked back the claim and said that the assholes may actually grow in the coming years

05:25.620 --> 05:31.340
Two years later in the same publication. They went back to the original claim that the Maldives was under

05:31.460 --> 05:33.460
grave threat in

05:33.820 --> 05:35.300
2018

05:35.300 --> 05:41.260
Phys.org repeated the claim that climate change may actually help to grow the assholes

05:41.260 --> 05:43.260
But no one's walked back any claims

05:43.540 --> 05:48.780
There's nothing contradictory about studies that show increasing salination and storm surges

05:49.300 --> 05:56.220
alongside studies that show increasing at all sighs because they're all happening and they've all been reported and

05:56.420 --> 05:58.740
predicted in scientific journals for decades

05:59.420 --> 06:04.580
In fact I covered this in my video climate change hurricanes atolls and coral reefs

06:04.860 --> 06:10.440
Dead coral either broken off by wave action or marine organisms builds up to form an island

06:10.440 --> 06:12.940
And it's still building these islands today

06:13.460 --> 06:21.140
This isn't exactly news the process was first postulated by Charles Darwin and a number of papers have been published over the decades

06:21.580 --> 06:25.900
Documenting the continuing growth of these islands although research continues

06:25.940 --> 06:31.740
There's as yet little evidence that the expected rate of sea level rise will reverse that in

06:32.220 --> 06:37.300
2010 Arthur Webb and Paul Kench analyzed hundreds of historical aerial photographs and

06:37.580 --> 06:43.860
Confirmed that 23 out of 27 Pacific atolls are indeed either stable or growing in size

06:44.540 --> 06:46.460
including Tuvalu

06:46.460 --> 06:50.200
So why do climate scientists insist that these islands face problems?

06:50.480 --> 06:57.880
Well the problems are related to other issues caused by climate change such as storm surges coastal erosion and saline intrusion

06:58.400 --> 07:01.120
Not total submergence from rising seas

07:01.520 --> 07:07.360
But of course the stability of the islands depends on the continuing health of the coral reefs and as coral reefs

07:07.480 --> 07:13.760
Continue to die because of rising water temperature the protection and growth they afford will diminish

07:14.200 --> 07:21.160
In fact this is explained in the very articles academic agent sites and the studies on which they're based

07:21.680 --> 07:24.440
It's just a question of reading beyond the headlines

07:25.040 --> 07:30.160
So now that we understand the premise is wrong the rest is pretty easy to straighten out

07:30.160 --> 07:37.000
This narrative is so well-worn that it has even made it onto the GCSE science syllabus

07:37.200 --> 07:42.200
For non British viewers. That's a core curriculum exam taken by all

07:42.680 --> 07:49.200
16 year olds in this country and quite right too because that's what schools teach science

07:49.840 --> 07:56.980
We may not live to see the year 2060, but children of today will they'll be the scientists economists and administrators

07:57.400 --> 08:04.480
Of the future who'll have to deal with salination and annual storm surges and the dislocation of island populations

08:04.800 --> 08:08.080
So what could possibly be wrong with teaching this in school?

08:08.680 --> 08:11.360
Not in an alarmist or emotional way

08:11.520 --> 08:18.320
But as sound practical academic study foreign direct investment in the Maldives has more than quadrupled

08:18.920 --> 08:20.920
since the year 2000

08:21.000 --> 08:26.000
This is very strange behavior from people betting with their own money

08:26.360 --> 08:32.640
Don't they know that their money will be under the sea before long, but of course anyone who checks this claim

08:33.080 --> 08:36.280
Including the smart investor knows that that's nonsense

08:37.040 --> 08:43.400
Before long is actually decades away and that's more than enough time to see the fruits of an investment

08:44.080 --> 08:49.400
After all all assets will depreciate over time with or without sea level rise

08:49.920 --> 08:55.920
So to reap the rewards of an investment you either need enough time to see profitability outstripped

08:56.320 --> 09:01.600
appreciation or you need to know that when you sell the investment years from now even with the era of

09:02.120 --> 09:05.200
Undrinkable water and annual inundation getting closer

09:05.520 --> 09:08.860
You'll be able to offload it onto the second type of investor

09:09.120 --> 09:15.160
People who don't bother to fact-check and who believe that this wild and implausible claim the Maldives

09:15.320 --> 09:20.720
May be under the sea by the year 2030 is actually a scientific prediction

09:21.140 --> 09:22.560
So 20 years from now

09:22.560 --> 09:24.960
They'll be very happy to invest in the Maldives

09:25.320 --> 09:32.240
Despite scientific predictions about salty drinking water on the grounds that predictions about the Maldives going underwater by

09:32.480 --> 09:34.760
2030 turned out not to be true

09:35.400 --> 09:40.120
Most of them won't even bother watching this video showing that no such prediction was made

09:43.120 --> 09:44.280
Well, yes

09:44.280 --> 09:47.920
But the real Maldives mystery is why so many self-professed

09:48.440 --> 09:53.320
Skeptics who watched the video didn't bother to spend just a few minutes fact-checking

09:53.940 --> 09:56.480
To find out whether any of this was true
