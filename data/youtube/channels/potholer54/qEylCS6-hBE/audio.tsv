0	4960	A few people messaged me on the channel page asking about yet another video doing the rounds
4960	10260	of social media, Top 5 Climate Myths by Steven Crowder.
10260	14200	I don't know why this has become so popular, but the fact that several people cited the
14200	18440	same thing made me think it would be worth doing a short video on it.
18440	19920	So here goes.
19920	25220	Unless you accept all of those points wholesale, you are labelled a science denier by the same
25220	29800	people who often push the idea that gender is merely a figment of your imagination.
29800	34780	Well I don't accept all these points wholesale, Steve, and I'm certainly not a science denier
34780	39360	or someone who thinks gender is a figment of one's imagination.
39360	45160	As I've said before on my channel, the word denier is itself derogatory and unscientific.
45160	49760	But if we take the politics, subjectivity and emotion out of these statements, then
49760	51320	yes I do accept them.
51320	52320	The Earth is warming.
52320	54720	I accept that the Earth is warming.
54720	57360	Number two, that humans are the primary cause of it.
57360	61480	I'm not going to accept that humans are the primary cause, because that leads to all kinds
61480	67600	of emotional arguments about religion and guilt and it's all our fault or it's not our fault.
67600	71020	Critics of climate science point out that the Earth's climate has been changing for
71020	76600	millions of years before humans came along, and they've got a good point.
76600	81160	So if we just strip this down to the science, the evidence shows that the cause of warming
81160	83960	is increased levels of carbon dioxide.
83960	86640	Number three, that it will have catastrophic results.
86640	90440	Because you don't define what catastrophic means, Steve.
90440	94200	One man's catastrophe is another man's minor inconvenience.
94200	98960	So again, let's go with what's been published in the scientific literature, which strips
98960	104880	out emotional adjectives and just deals with the quantifiable consequences of global warming,
104880	110480	mainly higher sea levels, stronger hurricanes, increased salination, drought and flood, coastal
110480	112920	erosion and acidification of the oceans.
112920	117880	And most importantly, number four, that the only entity competent and fit to stop these
117880	122360	results is the United States government or some international form of government.
122360	126040	Well, obviously, you can't be a science denier if you don't think the solution lies in more
126040	131920	government control, because that's a matter of opinion and politics, not science.
131920	135960	So before you start arguing about the best solution for an issue that you say doesn't
135960	140280	exist, perhaps the first step should be to accept the science.
140280	142560	Maybe you believe all of these points, and that's fine.
142560	144160	I want to hear from you in the comments section.
144160	148800	Well, at the request of a few of my subscribers, you're hearing from me in this video.
148800	149800	Hi.
149800	154080	Now, if you still don't accept the science with all the politics and subjectivity stripped
154080	158640	out, then you're still not a science denier, Steve, but you are someone who prefers to
158640	163240	believe what he reads in blogs rather than accept what's published in the scientific
163240	164440	literature.
164440	165440	So here goes.
165440	166440	The consensus.
166440	171800	97% of scientists agree on climate change.
171800	175440	As I've said many times, science isn't decided by consensus.
175440	179700	After all, not all scientists agree that the Earth is billions of years old or that animals
179700	182920	evolved or that HIV causes AIDS.
182920	184460	But sorry, Steve, what do you say?
184460	186260	Science isn't determined by consensus.
186260	187420	It's determined by truth.
187420	191060	There might have been consensus that the Earth was flat among certain circles.
191060	192060	Truth revealed that it wasn't.
192060	193900	Yes, he's absolutely right.
193900	195840	It's not determined by consensus.
195840	200400	Although, come on, it's not determined by revealed truth either.
200400	205320	Science isn't religion, so it's determined by evidence, what's known as observation
205320	207440	and inference.
207440	211040	Scientific theories get accepted and made part of the teaching curriculum, not because
211040	215120	most scientists vote for them, but because they're supported by what's called the
215120	221160	overwhelming preponderance of evidence, which is published in respected scientific journals.
221160	226060	I explained this last year in my video Scientific Consensus and Arguments from Authority.
226060	231500	So if you're curious to know why some hypotheses get accepted and others fall by the wayside,
231500	233140	then take a look.
233140	238240	And if you don't like the system, don't blame me, I'm just telling you how it works.
238240	242180	And it does work because it's shown us the link between natural selection and evolution,
242180	247420	between HIV and AIDS, plate tectonics and earthquakes, and yes, carbon dioxide and global
247420	248660	temperature.
248660	252780	You can't praise the method for giving us the theories you like and then say the method
252780	256420	doesn't work when it gives us a theory you don't like.
256420	261140	But on the question of whether these theories are decided by consensus, they're not.
261140	265500	And no poll of scientists, whoever that might be, has ever been taken.
265500	269220	So I agree, Steve, this myth is busted.
269220	270220	Myth number two.
270220	271980	The ice sheets are melting.
271980	272980	Truth.
272980	277260	The Antarctic ice sheets are actually growing by billions of tonnes per year.
277260	279820	Yes, that's according to a study by NASA.
279860	284380	It says Antarctic ice is growing by 82 billion tonnes a year.
284380	287840	And of course, researchers have a very good idea as to why that's happening.
287840	290580	But of course, there are two major ice sheets on Earth.
290580	293660	One is Antarctica, the other is Greenland.
293660	295380	So now, let's hear the figure for Greenland.
295380	298740	According to the new analysis of satellite data, the Antarctic ice sheet showed a net
298740	304380	gain of 112 billion tonnes of ice per year from 1992 to 2001.
304380	309740	Actually, the most recent figure is 82 billion tonnes a year, which you'll mention in a minute.
309740	313940	But now give us the figure for the Earth's other ice sheet on Greenland, so we can work
313940	317500	out the net figure and see whether the myth is true or not.
317500	320500	So where does the myth come from that the ice sheets are melting?
320500	327460	The net gain, net gain being the key words, slowed down to only 82 billion tonnes of Greenland.
327460	328460	Greenland, Steve.
328460	330060	You still haven't given us the figure for Greenland.
330060	331060	I know what you're thinking.
331060	332060	OK, numbers are relative.
332060	333060	No.
333060	336980	I'm thinking, why do you only give us the figure for one ice sheet that happens to fit
336980	341420	your narrative that ice sheets aren't melting, but you won't give us the figure for the other
341420	342620	ice sheet?
342620	344660	So I'll do it myself.
344660	349180	While Antarctica may be gaining ice to the tune of 82 billion tonnes a year, Greenland
349180	353900	is losing ice to the tune of 269 billion tonnes a year.
353900	358820	In other words, on a global scale, the ice sheets are indeed melting away at the rate
358820	361980	of around 187 billion tonnes a year.
361980	368220	That's a net melt of 187 cubic kilometres of ice every year.
368220	371980	And if we add in glaciers and sea ice, the net melt is even larger.
371980	374700	So where does the myth come from that the ice sheets are melting?
374700	378980	Well, Steve, it comes from an appraisal of measurements taken of both ice sheets, not
378980	383300	just the one you happen to read because it's been copied and pasted on the blogosphere.
383300	387060	It comes from people who read the scientific literature, not blogs.
387060	391940	And it comes from NASA, the people whose results you believe for Antarctica, but quietly ignore
391940	393240	in Greenland.
393240	397400	It comes from people who want to see the whole picture, not just a part of the picture that
397400	400140	suits their preconceived beliefs.
400140	401860	That's where the myth comes from.
401860	405620	And that's why this myth is very definitely confirmed.
405620	407160	Myth!
407160	410060	The polar bears are dying off!
410060	411640	OK.
411640	412640	So what?
412640	413640	Truth!
413640	417220	There are possibly more of these soulless killing monsters on Earth today than ever.
417220	419060	Certainly since we've begun monitoring them.
419060	422300	What's that got to do with the issue of whether the Earth is warming, whether carbon dioxide
422300	426620	is the cause, and whether it'll cause stronger hurricanes, increased salination, droughts
426620	430740	and floods and sea level rise, and acidification of the oceans and fewer coral reefs and more
430740	432680	coastal erosion?
432680	435340	These are the myths you're supposed to be busting.
435340	437660	But OK, let's take a look anyway.
437660	442020	Crowder tells us to go to his website for his source, which I did.
442020	444780	It's a blog called factcheck.org.
444780	449800	It says there has indeed been a rise in polar bear numbers since the 1970s, due mainly to
449800	453080	legislation banning polar bear hunting.
453080	457700	And it also says many scientists believe that due to climate change and resulting environmental
457700	460740	factors, the trend is reversing.
460740	463180	Now remember, this is Crowder's source.
463180	466980	And funnily enough, he never mentioned any of this.
466980	471840	Crowder's other source from which he got this graph is, of course, another blog.
471840	474660	The blogger thinks numbers may be increasing.
474660	476320	And she could be right.
476320	479760	My policy is not to believe everything I read in blogs.
479760	482920	But both of Crowder's sources agree on one thing.
482920	485280	We simply don't know for sure.
485280	486280	That's not my assessment.
486280	488440	I haven't got a clue either.
488440	491440	That's the assessment of the blog's Crowder sites.
491440	496060	So despite his revealed truth that polar bear numbers are increasing, we can chalk that
496060	498320	myth down to don't know.
498320	501920	And as far as the question of whether carbon dioxide is the cause of global warming is
501920	506420	concerned, the number of polar bears is totally irrelevant.
506420	507420	Myth number four.
507420	509400	Our current climate models are accurate.
509400	513440	Crowder doesn't actually address the myth he set up, but he does talk about a variety
513440	514440	of other things.
514440	518400	We rely on a few organizations for these predictions, one of which is NOAA.
518400	523940	They can't even accurately predict how many hurricanes there will be this year in Florida.
523940	525580	That's right, they can't.
525580	527320	What a shame that wasn't the myth.
527320	531160	Over 300 scientists are imploring lawmakers to investigate NOAA.
531160	532400	Well, not quite.
532400	536880	The list includes Christopher Monckton, who's a politician, and John Coleman, who graduated
536880	541120	in media studies, and of course Tim Ball, who claims once again to have been a professor
541120	545040	of climatology when, in fact, he was a professor of geography.
545040	551760	But anyway, these people claim NOAA wrongly adjusted temperature data in this 2015 paper.
551760	556520	So why didn't these 300 signatories simply write a response paper pointing out what they
556520	558800	saw as flaws in the NOAA methodology?
558800	560400	Who knows?
560400	565400	Whatever the reason, this still isn't the myth Crowder tasked himself with busting.
565400	570240	So many predictions being wrong, including, by the way, nearly all of the predictions
570240	573720	made in Al Gore's Oscar-nominated An Inconvenient Truth.
573720	577400	Mistakes in Al Gore's movie is evidence that climate research has got things wrong?
577400	578780	Seriously, Steve?
578780	582880	Which predictions to rattle off a few like Mount Kilimanjaro as we address the polar
582880	583880	bears?
583880	585160	North Pole still has ice.
585160	589520	But you can't then make the leap that because people get things wrong in the public media
589520	592540	that the science must therefore be wrong.
592540	597480	Researchers can't be held responsible for the mistakes made by Al Gore and environmentalists
597480	601120	any more than they can be held responsible for the mistakes made by the bloggers you
601120	602120	use as sources.
602120	607080	But you can go back to the 70s and find other doomsday predictions, like global cooling.
607080	611160	But again, what's that got to do with climate researchers?
611160	615260	Never mind the predictions made by movies, books, magazines and individuals with the
615260	620760	scientific acumen of Cheez Whiz, let's deal with the predictions of real, actual climate
620760	624840	researchers, as published in the scientific literature.
624840	627280	Isn't that what you're trying to prove is wrong?
627280	632760	The vast majority of published papers in the 1960s and 70s were predicting warming, not
632760	636120	cooling, by a margin of 44 to 7.
636120	640480	And the reason they gave for this predicted warming was increasing levels of CO2.
640480	646080	Due to our release through factories and automobiles every year of more than 6 billion tonnes of
646080	652200	carbon dioxide, which helps air absorb heat from the sun, our atmosphere seems to be getting
652200	653200	warmer.
653200	654200	This is bad.
654200	659640	Well, it's been calculated a few degrees rise in the Earth's temperature would melt the
659640	661100	polar ice cap.
661100	665640	That isn't a recent propaganda message from Greenpeace, it was an educational film shown
665640	669240	in schools and colleges in 1958.
669240	673240	And of course those predictions have proved 100% accurate.
673240	678600	Ice sheets, glaciers and sea ice are melting, and the rate of melt is accelerating.
678600	683240	Temperatures have been rising to record levels, even when increased pollution and lower solar
683240	686600	output should have been sending temperatures lower.
686600	690840	And while we all tend to focus on atmospheric temperatures, remember that climate scientists
690840	692640	look at the Earth as a whole.
692640	698340	90% of the extra heat is going into the oceans, which have also fulfilled the predictions
698340	699740	of warming.
699740	704500	The only thing climate models can't do is predict short term changes, because in the
704500	708800	short term there are lots of minor fluctuations that affect measurements like temperature
708800	710340	and sea level.
710340	715220	It's like me trying to predict on January 1st in Denver whether the temperature on February
715220	717780	1st will be warmer or colder.
717780	719480	It's almost impossible.
719480	723980	But looking further into the future it gets easier, and I can confidently predict that
723980	729460	the temperature in Denver will be higher in May and much higher in July.
729460	733660	That's because over short periods of time the increasing warming of the sun may not
733660	736180	overcome short term fluctuations.
736180	741300	But over a longer period of time these background fluctuations become less significant.
741300	746280	And while temperatures may go up and down on a daily or even weekly basis, I can confidently
746280	750980	predict that every month in Denver between January and July is going to be warmer on
750980	753340	average than the previous one.
753340	758540	So what climate models can do, and have done very successfully, is predict the long term
758540	760100	trend.
760100	764840	When geologists applied the model to the past 500 million years, it fit almost perfectly
764840	768300	with the continuous changes in the Earth's climate.
768300	772320	Geologists discovered that changing levels of carbon dioxide explained nearly all the
772320	774540	long term changes in temperature.
774540	779100	The model explained the so-called faint sun paradox – that's the problem of why the
779100	784300	Earth was much hotter than today at a time when the sun was much, much weaker.
784300	788460	It was because CO2 levels were many times higher than today.
788460	792880	The model explained why the Earth escaped from a deep freeze during the Precambrian.
792880	797700	It was because of a slow accumulation of carbon dioxide from volcanoes.
797700	803020	The model explained why the Earth has maintained a Goldilocks climate ever since, because as
803020	808080	the sun has been getting increasingly hotter, the high levels of carbon dioxide have gradually
808080	813720	been taken out of the atmosphere and buried as limestone, coal and oil.
813720	818160	And the model solved the problem of why the Earth warmed so much after each glaciation
818160	822480	given that the increased insulation that sparked them wasn't strong enough to melt the ice
822480	823480	sheets.
823480	828080	In fact, the climate model works so well that carbon dioxide is being called the Earth's
828080	832680	thermostat and the long term regulator of the Earth's climate.
832680	836880	We even understand the mechanism by which carbon dioxide can do this.
836880	841240	It's in peer-reviewed research papers going back over a hundred years, when it was first
841240	846440	discovered that carbon dioxide absorbs long-wave radiation, and a physicist calculated as far
846440	851340	back as the 19th century that if the carbon dioxide level ever got high enough, it could
851340	853880	affect the Earth's climate.
853880	856300	Talk about a prescient prediction!
856300	860880	So notwithstanding the fact that Al Gore and assorted environmentalists often make wacky
860880	866680	predictions that are wrong, as far as researchers in the field of glaciology, atmospheric physics,
866680	871360	oceanography, geology, paleoclimatology, and all the other assorted disciplines that
871360	877720	have built up this model are concerned, this myth is confirmed.
877720	884040	National or international government is the only entity capable of solving imminent climate
884040	885040	change catastrophe.
885040	889080	Well, as I said at the beginning, that's not only a political question, it's tackling a
889080	891980	problem that you say doesn't exist.
891980	894980	So here's my suggestion for your next video, Steve.
894980	897220	What's the issues you put up at the beginning?
897220	898940	Is the Earth warming?
898940	902340	Is carbon dioxide from fossil fuel burning the cause?
902340	906380	Will the result be higher sea levels, stronger hurricanes, increased salination, drought
906380	910380	and flood, acidification of the oceans, and coastal erosion?
910380	915500	These are the things that matter to us, because they'll affect our food supply, our infrastructure,
915500	918380	and most importantly, our wallets.
918380	923060	That matters more to people than the number of bloody polar bears.
923060	926860	Put these questions up as myths and see if you can bust them.
926860	931300	But don't just cite a blog and tell people Fred Blogger doesn't believe it, so that proves
931300	932300	it's not true.
932300	935860	You're an intelligent man, dig a little deeper.
935860	938380	Check the blogger's source and verify it.
938380	942340	Find out what the science says by checking the scientific literature, and see if there's
942340	947240	a discrepancy or an explanation of why the blogger might have got his facts wrong.
947240	951960	Look at all the evidence, not just the bits that give you the answer you want.
951960	956960	With the deepest respect, talking louder doesn't mean you're better informed.
