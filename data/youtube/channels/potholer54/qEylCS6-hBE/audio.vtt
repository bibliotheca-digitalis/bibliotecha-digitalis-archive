00:00.000 --> 00:04.960
A few people messaged me on the channel page asking about yet another video doing the rounds

00:04.960 --> 00:10.260
of social media, Top 5 Climate Myths by Steven Crowder.

00:10.260 --> 00:14.200
I don't know why this has become so popular, but the fact that several people cited the

00:14.200 --> 00:18.440
same thing made me think it would be worth doing a short video on it.

00:18.440 --> 00:19.920
So here goes.

00:19.920 --> 00:25.220
Unless you accept all of those points wholesale, you are labelled a science denier by the same

00:25.220 --> 00:29.800
people who often push the idea that gender is merely a figment of your imagination.

00:29.800 --> 00:34.780
Well I don't accept all these points wholesale, Steve, and I'm certainly not a science denier

00:34.780 --> 00:39.360
or someone who thinks gender is a figment of one's imagination.

00:39.360 --> 00:45.160
As I've said before on my channel, the word denier is itself derogatory and unscientific.

00:45.160 --> 00:49.760
But if we take the politics, subjectivity and emotion out of these statements, then

00:49.760 --> 00:51.320
yes I do accept them.

00:51.320 --> 00:52.320
The Earth is warming.

00:52.320 --> 00:54.720
I accept that the Earth is warming.

00:54.720 --> 00:57.360
Number two, that humans are the primary cause of it.

00:57.360 --> 01:01.480
I'm not going to accept that humans are the primary cause, because that leads to all kinds

01:01.480 --> 01:07.600
of emotional arguments about religion and guilt and it's all our fault or it's not our fault.

01:07.600 --> 01:11.020
Critics of climate science point out that the Earth's climate has been changing for

01:11.020 --> 01:16.600
millions of years before humans came along, and they've got a good point.

01:16.600 --> 01:21.160
So if we just strip this down to the science, the evidence shows that the cause of warming

01:21.160 --> 01:23.960
is increased levels of carbon dioxide.

01:23.960 --> 01:26.640
Number three, that it will have catastrophic results.

01:26.640 --> 01:30.440
Because you don't define what catastrophic means, Steve.

01:30.440 --> 01:34.200
One man's catastrophe is another man's minor inconvenience.

01:34.200 --> 01:38.960
So again, let's go with what's been published in the scientific literature, which strips

01:38.960 --> 01:44.880
out emotional adjectives and just deals with the quantifiable consequences of global warming,

01:44.880 --> 01:50.480
mainly higher sea levels, stronger hurricanes, increased salination, drought and flood, coastal

01:50.480 --> 01:52.920
erosion and acidification of the oceans.

01:52.920 --> 01:57.880
And most importantly, number four, that the only entity competent and fit to stop these

01:57.880 --> 02:02.360
results is the United States government or some international form of government.

02:02.360 --> 02:06.040
Well, obviously, you can't be a science denier if you don't think the solution lies in more

02:06.040 --> 02:11.920
government control, because that's a matter of opinion and politics, not science.

02:11.920 --> 02:15.960
So before you start arguing about the best solution for an issue that you say doesn't

02:15.960 --> 02:20.280
exist, perhaps the first step should be to accept the science.

02:20.280 --> 02:22.560
Maybe you believe all of these points, and that's fine.

02:22.560 --> 02:24.160
I want to hear from you in the comments section.

02:24.160 --> 02:28.800
Well, at the request of a few of my subscribers, you're hearing from me in this video.

02:28.800 --> 02:29.800
Hi.

02:29.800 --> 02:34.080
Now, if you still don't accept the science with all the politics and subjectivity stripped

02:34.080 --> 02:38.640
out, then you're still not a science denier, Steve, but you are someone who prefers to

02:38.640 --> 02:43.240
believe what he reads in blogs rather than accept what's published in the scientific

02:43.240 --> 02:44.440
literature.

02:44.440 --> 02:45.440
So here goes.

02:45.440 --> 02:46.440
The consensus.

02:46.440 --> 02:51.800
97% of scientists agree on climate change.

02:51.800 --> 02:55.440
As I've said many times, science isn't decided by consensus.

02:55.440 --> 02:59.700
After all, not all scientists agree that the Earth is billions of years old or that animals

02:59.700 --> 03:02.920
evolved or that HIV causes AIDS.

03:02.920 --> 03:04.460
But sorry, Steve, what do you say?

03:04.460 --> 03:06.260
Science isn't determined by consensus.

03:06.260 --> 03:07.420
It's determined by truth.

03:07.420 --> 03:11.060
There might have been consensus that the Earth was flat among certain circles.

03:11.060 --> 03:12.060
Truth revealed that it wasn't.

03:12.060 --> 03:13.900
Yes, he's absolutely right.

03:13.900 --> 03:15.840
It's not determined by consensus.

03:15.840 --> 03:20.400
Although, come on, it's not determined by revealed truth either.

03:20.400 --> 03:25.320
Science isn't religion, so it's determined by evidence, what's known as observation

03:25.320 --> 03:27.440
and inference.

03:27.440 --> 03:31.040
Scientific theories get accepted and made part of the teaching curriculum, not because

03:31.040 --> 03:35.120
most scientists vote for them, but because they're supported by what's called the

03:35.120 --> 03:41.160
overwhelming preponderance of evidence, which is published in respected scientific journals.

03:41.160 --> 03:46.060
I explained this last year in my video Scientific Consensus and Arguments from Authority.

03:46.060 --> 03:51.500
So if you're curious to know why some hypotheses get accepted and others fall by the wayside,

03:51.500 --> 03:53.140
then take a look.

03:53.140 --> 03:58.240
And if you don't like the system, don't blame me, I'm just telling you how it works.

03:58.240 --> 04:02.180
And it does work because it's shown us the link between natural selection and evolution,

04:02.180 --> 04:07.420
between HIV and AIDS, plate tectonics and earthquakes, and yes, carbon dioxide and global

04:07.420 --> 04:08.660
temperature.

04:08.660 --> 04:12.780
You can't praise the method for giving us the theories you like and then say the method

04:12.780 --> 04:16.420
doesn't work when it gives us a theory you don't like.

04:16.420 --> 04:21.140
But on the question of whether these theories are decided by consensus, they're not.

04:21.140 --> 04:25.500
And no poll of scientists, whoever that might be, has ever been taken.

04:25.500 --> 04:29.220
So I agree, Steve, this myth is busted.

04:29.220 --> 04:30.220
Myth number two.

04:30.220 --> 04:31.980
The ice sheets are melting.

04:31.980 --> 04:32.980
Truth.

04:32.980 --> 04:37.260
The Antarctic ice sheets are actually growing by billions of tonnes per year.

04:37.260 --> 04:39.820
Yes, that's according to a study by NASA.

04:39.860 --> 04:44.380
It says Antarctic ice is growing by 82 billion tonnes a year.

04:44.380 --> 04:47.840
And of course, researchers have a very good idea as to why that's happening.

04:47.840 --> 04:50.580
But of course, there are two major ice sheets on Earth.

04:50.580 --> 04:53.660
One is Antarctica, the other is Greenland.

04:53.660 --> 04:55.380
So now, let's hear the figure for Greenland.

04:55.380 --> 04:58.740
According to the new analysis of satellite data, the Antarctic ice sheet showed a net

04:58.740 --> 05:04.380
gain of 112 billion tonnes of ice per year from 1992 to 2001.

05:04.380 --> 05:09.740
Actually, the most recent figure is 82 billion tonnes a year, which you'll mention in a minute.

05:09.740 --> 05:13.940
But now give us the figure for the Earth's other ice sheet on Greenland, so we can work

05:13.940 --> 05:17.500
out the net figure and see whether the myth is true or not.

05:17.500 --> 05:20.500
So where does the myth come from that the ice sheets are melting?

05:20.500 --> 05:27.460
The net gain, net gain being the key words, slowed down to only 82 billion tonnes of Greenland.

05:27.460 --> 05:28.460
Greenland, Steve.

05:28.460 --> 05:30.060
You still haven't given us the figure for Greenland.

05:30.060 --> 05:31.060
I know what you're thinking.

05:31.060 --> 05:32.060
OK, numbers are relative.

05:32.060 --> 05:33.060
No.

05:33.060 --> 05:36.980
I'm thinking, why do you only give us the figure for one ice sheet that happens to fit

05:36.980 --> 05:41.420
your narrative that ice sheets aren't melting, but you won't give us the figure for the other

05:41.420 --> 05:42.620
ice sheet?

05:42.620 --> 05:44.660
So I'll do it myself.

05:44.660 --> 05:49.180
While Antarctica may be gaining ice to the tune of 82 billion tonnes a year, Greenland

05:49.180 --> 05:53.900
is losing ice to the tune of 269 billion tonnes a year.

05:53.900 --> 05:58.820
In other words, on a global scale, the ice sheets are indeed melting away at the rate

05:58.820 --> 06:01.980
of around 187 billion tonnes a year.

06:01.980 --> 06:08.220
That's a net melt of 187 cubic kilometres of ice every year.

06:08.220 --> 06:11.980
And if we add in glaciers and sea ice, the net melt is even larger.

06:11.980 --> 06:14.700
So where does the myth come from that the ice sheets are melting?

06:14.700 --> 06:18.980
Well, Steve, it comes from an appraisal of measurements taken of both ice sheets, not

06:18.980 --> 06:23.300
just the one you happen to read because it's been copied and pasted on the blogosphere.

06:23.300 --> 06:27.060
It comes from people who read the scientific literature, not blogs.

06:27.060 --> 06:31.940
And it comes from NASA, the people whose results you believe for Antarctica, but quietly ignore

06:31.940 --> 06:33.240
in Greenland.

06:33.240 --> 06:37.400
It comes from people who want to see the whole picture, not just a part of the picture that

06:37.400 --> 06:40.140
suits their preconceived beliefs.

06:40.140 --> 06:41.860
That's where the myth comes from.

06:41.860 --> 06:45.620
And that's why this myth is very definitely confirmed.

06:45.620 --> 06:47.160
Myth!

06:47.160 --> 06:50.060
The polar bears are dying off!

06:50.060 --> 06:51.640
OK.

06:51.640 --> 06:52.640
So what?

06:52.640 --> 06:53.640
Truth!

06:53.640 --> 06:57.220
There are possibly more of these soulless killing monsters on Earth today than ever.

06:57.220 --> 06:59.060
Certainly since we've begun monitoring them.

06:59.060 --> 07:02.300
What's that got to do with the issue of whether the Earth is warming, whether carbon dioxide

07:02.300 --> 07:06.620
is the cause, and whether it'll cause stronger hurricanes, increased salination, droughts

07:06.620 --> 07:10.740
and floods and sea level rise, and acidification of the oceans and fewer coral reefs and more

07:10.740 --> 07:12.680
coastal erosion?

07:12.680 --> 07:15.340
These are the myths you're supposed to be busting.

07:15.340 --> 07:17.660
But OK, let's take a look anyway.

07:17.660 --> 07:22.020
Crowder tells us to go to his website for his source, which I did.

07:22.020 --> 07:24.780
It's a blog called factcheck.org.

07:24.780 --> 07:29.800
It says there has indeed been a rise in polar bear numbers since the 1970s, due mainly to

07:29.800 --> 07:33.080
legislation banning polar bear hunting.

07:33.080 --> 07:37.700
And it also says many scientists believe that due to climate change and resulting environmental

07:37.700 --> 07:40.740
factors, the trend is reversing.

07:40.740 --> 07:43.180
Now remember, this is Crowder's source.

07:43.180 --> 07:46.980
And funnily enough, he never mentioned any of this.

07:46.980 --> 07:51.840
Crowder's other source from which he got this graph is, of course, another blog.

07:51.840 --> 07:54.660
The blogger thinks numbers may be increasing.

07:54.660 --> 07:56.320
And she could be right.

07:56.320 --> 07:59.760
My policy is not to believe everything I read in blogs.

07:59.760 --> 08:02.920
But both of Crowder's sources agree on one thing.

08:02.920 --> 08:05.280
We simply don't know for sure.

08:05.280 --> 08:06.280
That's not my assessment.

08:06.280 --> 08:08.440
I haven't got a clue either.

08:08.440 --> 08:11.440
That's the assessment of the blog's Crowder sites.

08:11.440 --> 08:16.060
So despite his revealed truth that polar bear numbers are increasing, we can chalk that

08:16.060 --> 08:18.320
myth down to don't know.

08:18.320 --> 08:21.920
And as far as the question of whether carbon dioxide is the cause of global warming is

08:21.920 --> 08:26.420
concerned, the number of polar bears is totally irrelevant.

08:26.420 --> 08:27.420
Myth number four.

08:27.420 --> 08:29.400
Our current climate models are accurate.

08:29.400 --> 08:33.440
Crowder doesn't actually address the myth he set up, but he does talk about a variety

08:33.440 --> 08:34.440
of other things.

08:34.440 --> 08:38.400
We rely on a few organizations for these predictions, one of which is NOAA.

08:38.400 --> 08:43.940
They can't even accurately predict how many hurricanes there will be this year in Florida.

08:43.940 --> 08:45.580
That's right, they can't.

08:45.580 --> 08:47.320
What a shame that wasn't the myth.

08:47.320 --> 08:51.160
Over 300 scientists are imploring lawmakers to investigate NOAA.

08:51.160 --> 08:52.400
Well, not quite.

08:52.400 --> 08:56.880
The list includes Christopher Monckton, who's a politician, and John Coleman, who graduated

08:56.880 --> 09:01.120
in media studies, and of course Tim Ball, who claims once again to have been a professor

09:01.120 --> 09:05.040
of climatology when, in fact, he was a professor of geography.

09:05.040 --> 09:11.760
But anyway, these people claim NOAA wrongly adjusted temperature data in this 2015 paper.

09:11.760 --> 09:16.520
So why didn't these 300 signatories simply write a response paper pointing out what they

09:16.520 --> 09:18.800
saw as flaws in the NOAA methodology?

09:18.800 --> 09:20.400
Who knows?

09:20.400 --> 09:25.400
Whatever the reason, this still isn't the myth Crowder tasked himself with busting.

09:25.400 --> 09:30.240
So many predictions being wrong, including, by the way, nearly all of the predictions

09:30.240 --> 09:33.720
made in Al Gore's Oscar-nominated An Inconvenient Truth.

09:33.720 --> 09:37.400
Mistakes in Al Gore's movie is evidence that climate research has got things wrong?

09:37.400 --> 09:38.780
Seriously, Steve?

09:38.780 --> 09:42.880
Which predictions to rattle off a few like Mount Kilimanjaro as we address the polar

09:42.880 --> 09:43.880
bears?

09:43.880 --> 09:45.160
North Pole still has ice.

09:45.160 --> 09:49.520
But you can't then make the leap that because people get things wrong in the public media

09:49.520 --> 09:52.540
that the science must therefore be wrong.

09:52.540 --> 09:57.480
Researchers can't be held responsible for the mistakes made by Al Gore and environmentalists

09:57.480 --> 10:01.120
any more than they can be held responsible for the mistakes made by the bloggers you

10:01.120 --> 10:02.120
use as sources.

10:02.120 --> 10:07.080
But you can go back to the 70s and find other doomsday predictions, like global cooling.

10:07.080 --> 10:11.160
But again, what's that got to do with climate researchers?

10:11.160 --> 10:15.260
Never mind the predictions made by movies, books, magazines and individuals with the

10:15.260 --> 10:20.760
scientific acumen of Cheez Whiz, let's deal with the predictions of real, actual climate

10:20.760 --> 10:24.840
researchers, as published in the scientific literature.

10:24.840 --> 10:27.280
Isn't that what you're trying to prove is wrong?

10:27.280 --> 10:32.760
The vast majority of published papers in the 1960s and 70s were predicting warming, not

10:32.760 --> 10:36.120
cooling, by a margin of 44 to 7.

10:36.120 --> 10:40.480
And the reason they gave for this predicted warming was increasing levels of CO2.

10:40.480 --> 10:46.080
Due to our release through factories and automobiles every year of more than 6 billion tonnes of

10:46.080 --> 10:52.200
carbon dioxide, which helps air absorb heat from the sun, our atmosphere seems to be getting

10:52.200 --> 10:53.200
warmer.

10:53.200 --> 10:54.200
This is bad.

10:54.200 --> 10:59.640
Well, it's been calculated a few degrees rise in the Earth's temperature would melt the

10:59.640 --> 11:01.100
polar ice cap.

11:01.100 --> 11:05.640
That isn't a recent propaganda message from Greenpeace, it was an educational film shown

11:05.640 --> 11:09.240
in schools and colleges in 1958.

11:09.240 --> 11:13.240
And of course those predictions have proved 100% accurate.

11:13.240 --> 11:18.600
Ice sheets, glaciers and sea ice are melting, and the rate of melt is accelerating.

11:18.600 --> 11:23.240
Temperatures have been rising to record levels, even when increased pollution and lower solar

11:23.240 --> 11:26.600
output should have been sending temperatures lower.

11:26.600 --> 11:30.840
And while we all tend to focus on atmospheric temperatures, remember that climate scientists

11:30.840 --> 11:32.640
look at the Earth as a whole.

11:32.640 --> 11:38.340
90% of the extra heat is going into the oceans, which have also fulfilled the predictions

11:38.340 --> 11:39.740
of warming.

11:39.740 --> 11:44.500
The only thing climate models can't do is predict short term changes, because in the

11:44.500 --> 11:48.800
short term there are lots of minor fluctuations that affect measurements like temperature

11:48.800 --> 11:50.340
and sea level.

11:50.340 --> 11:55.220
It's like me trying to predict on January 1st in Denver whether the temperature on February

11:55.220 --> 11:57.780
1st will be warmer or colder.

11:57.780 --> 11:59.480
It's almost impossible.

11:59.480 --> 12:03.980
But looking further into the future it gets easier, and I can confidently predict that

12:03.980 --> 12:09.460
the temperature in Denver will be higher in May and much higher in July.

12:09.460 --> 12:13.660
That's because over short periods of time the increasing warming of the sun may not

12:13.660 --> 12:16.180
overcome short term fluctuations.

12:16.180 --> 12:21.300
But over a longer period of time these background fluctuations become less significant.

12:21.300 --> 12:26.280
And while temperatures may go up and down on a daily or even weekly basis, I can confidently

12:26.280 --> 12:30.980
predict that every month in Denver between January and July is going to be warmer on

12:30.980 --> 12:33.340
average than the previous one.

12:33.340 --> 12:38.540
So what climate models can do, and have done very successfully, is predict the long term

12:38.540 --> 12:40.100
trend.

12:40.100 --> 12:44.840
When geologists applied the model to the past 500 million years, it fit almost perfectly

12:44.840 --> 12:48.300
with the continuous changes in the Earth's climate.

12:48.300 --> 12:52.320
Geologists discovered that changing levels of carbon dioxide explained nearly all the

12:52.320 --> 12:54.540
long term changes in temperature.

12:54.540 --> 12:59.100
The model explained the so-called faint sun paradox – that's the problem of why the

12:59.100 --> 13:04.300
Earth was much hotter than today at a time when the sun was much, much weaker.

13:04.300 --> 13:08.460
It was because CO2 levels were many times higher than today.

13:08.460 --> 13:12.880
The model explained why the Earth escaped from a deep freeze during the Precambrian.

13:12.880 --> 13:17.700
It was because of a slow accumulation of carbon dioxide from volcanoes.

13:17.700 --> 13:23.020
The model explained why the Earth has maintained a Goldilocks climate ever since, because as

13:23.020 --> 13:28.080
the sun has been getting increasingly hotter, the high levels of carbon dioxide have gradually

13:28.080 --> 13:33.720
been taken out of the atmosphere and buried as limestone, coal and oil.

13:33.720 --> 13:38.160
And the model solved the problem of why the Earth warmed so much after each glaciation

13:38.160 --> 13:42.480
given that the increased insulation that sparked them wasn't strong enough to melt the ice

13:42.480 --> 13:43.480
sheets.

13:43.480 --> 13:48.080
In fact, the climate model works so well that carbon dioxide is being called the Earth's

13:48.080 --> 13:52.680
thermostat and the long term regulator of the Earth's climate.

13:52.680 --> 13:56.880
We even understand the mechanism by which carbon dioxide can do this.

13:56.880 --> 14:01.240
It's in peer-reviewed research papers going back over a hundred years, when it was first

14:01.240 --> 14:06.440
discovered that carbon dioxide absorbs long-wave radiation, and a physicist calculated as far

14:06.440 --> 14:11.340
back as the 19th century that if the carbon dioxide level ever got high enough, it could

14:11.340 --> 14:13.880
affect the Earth's climate.

14:13.880 --> 14:16.300
Talk about a prescient prediction!

14:16.300 --> 14:20.880
So notwithstanding the fact that Al Gore and assorted environmentalists often make wacky

14:20.880 --> 14:26.680
predictions that are wrong, as far as researchers in the field of glaciology, atmospheric physics,

14:26.680 --> 14:31.360
oceanography, geology, paleoclimatology, and all the other assorted disciplines that

14:31.360 --> 14:37.720
have built up this model are concerned, this myth is confirmed.

14:37.720 --> 14:44.040
National or international government is the only entity capable of solving imminent climate

14:44.040 --> 14:45.040
change catastrophe.

14:45.040 --> 14:49.080
Well, as I said at the beginning, that's not only a political question, it's tackling a

14:49.080 --> 14:51.980
problem that you say doesn't exist.

14:51.980 --> 14:54.980
So here's my suggestion for your next video, Steve.

14:54.980 --> 14:57.220
What's the issues you put up at the beginning?

14:57.220 --> 14:58.940
Is the Earth warming?

14:58.940 --> 15:02.340
Is carbon dioxide from fossil fuel burning the cause?

15:02.340 --> 15:06.380
Will the result be higher sea levels, stronger hurricanes, increased salination, drought

15:06.380 --> 15:10.380
and flood, acidification of the oceans, and coastal erosion?

15:10.380 --> 15:15.500
These are the things that matter to us, because they'll affect our food supply, our infrastructure,

15:15.500 --> 15:18.380
and most importantly, our wallets.

15:18.380 --> 15:23.060
That matters more to people than the number of bloody polar bears.

15:23.060 --> 15:26.860
Put these questions up as myths and see if you can bust them.

15:26.860 --> 15:31.300
But don't just cite a blog and tell people Fred Blogger doesn't believe it, so that proves

15:31.300 --> 15:32.300
it's not true.

15:32.300 --> 15:35.860
You're an intelligent man, dig a little deeper.

15:35.860 --> 15:38.380
Check the blogger's source and verify it.

15:38.380 --> 15:42.340
Find out what the science says by checking the scientific literature, and see if there's

15:42.340 --> 15:47.240
a discrepancy or an explanation of why the blogger might have got his facts wrong.

15:47.240 --> 15:51.960
Look at all the evidence, not just the bits that give you the answer you want.

15:51.960 --> 15:56.960
With the deepest respect, talking louder doesn't mean you're better informed.
