1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,960
A few people messaged me on the channel page asking about yet another video doing the rounds

2
00:00:04,960 --> 00:00:10,260
of social media, Top 5 Climate Myths by Steven Crowder.

3
00:00:10,260 --> 00:00:14,200
I don't know why this has become so popular, but the fact that several people cited the

4
00:00:14,200 --> 00:00:18,440
same thing made me think it would be worth doing a short video on it.

5
00:00:18,440 --> 00:00:19,920
So here goes.

6
00:00:19,920 --> 00:00:25,220
Unless you accept all of those points wholesale, you are labelled a science denier by the same

7
00:00:25,220 --> 00:00:29,800
people who often push the idea that gender is merely a figment of your imagination.

8
00:00:29,800 --> 00:00:34,780
Well I don't accept all these points wholesale, Steve, and I'm certainly not a science denier

9
00:00:34,780 --> 00:00:39,360
or someone who thinks gender is a figment of one's imagination.

10
00:00:39,360 --> 00:00:45,160
As I've said before on my channel, the word denier is itself derogatory and unscientific.

11
00:00:45,160 --> 00:00:49,760
But if we take the politics, subjectivity and emotion out of these statements, then

12
00:00:49,760 --> 00:00:51,320
yes I do accept them.

13
00:00:51,320 --> 00:00:52,320
The Earth is warming.

14
00:00:52,320 --> 00:00:54,720
I accept that the Earth is warming.

15
00:00:54,720 --> 00:00:57,360
Number two, that humans are the primary cause of it.

16
00:00:57,360 --> 00:01:01,480
I'm not going to accept that humans are the primary cause, because that leads to all kinds

17
00:01:01,480 --> 00:01:07,600
of emotional arguments about religion and guilt and it's all our fault or it's not our fault.

18
00:01:07,600 --> 00:01:11,020
Critics of climate science point out that the Earth's climate has been changing for

19
00:01:11,020 --> 00:01:16,600
millions of years before humans came along, and they've got a good point.

20
00:01:16,600 --> 00:01:21,160
So if we just strip this down to the science, the evidence shows that the cause of warming

21
00:01:21,160 --> 00:01:23,960
is increased levels of carbon dioxide.

22
00:01:23,960 --> 00:01:26,640
Number three, that it will have catastrophic results.

23
00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:30,440
Because you don't define what catastrophic means, Steve.

24
00:01:30,440 --> 00:01:34,200
One man's catastrophe is another man's minor inconvenience.

25
00:01:34,200 --> 00:01:38,960
So again, let's go with what's been published in the scientific literature, which strips

26
00:01:38,960 --> 00:01:44,880
out emotional adjectives and just deals with the quantifiable consequences of global warming,

27
00:01:44,880 --> 00:01:50,480
mainly higher sea levels, stronger hurricanes, increased salination, drought and flood, coastal

28
00:01:50,480 --> 00:01:52,920
erosion and acidification of the oceans.

29
00:01:52,920 --> 00:01:57,880
And most importantly, number four, that the only entity competent and fit to stop these

30
00:01:57,880 --> 00:02:02,360
results is the United States government or some international form of government.

31
00:02:02,360 --> 00:02:06,040
Well, obviously, you can't be a science denier if you don't think the solution lies in more

32
00:02:06,040 --> 00:02:11,920
government control, because that's a matter of opinion and politics, not science.

33
00:02:11,920 --> 00:02:15,960
So before you start arguing about the best solution for an issue that you say doesn't

34
00:02:15,960 --> 00:02:20,280
exist, perhaps the first step should be to accept the science.

35
00:02:20,280 --> 00:02:22,560
Maybe you believe all of these points, and that's fine.

36
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:24,160
I want to hear from you in the comments section.

37
00:02:24,160 --> 00:02:28,800
Well, at the request of a few of my subscribers, you're hearing from me in this video.

38
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:29,800
Hi.

39
00:02:29,800 --> 00:02:34,080
Now, if you still don't accept the science with all the politics and subjectivity stripped

40
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:38,640
out, then you're still not a science denier, Steve, but you are someone who prefers to

41
00:02:38,640 --> 00:02:43,240
believe what he reads in blogs rather than accept what's published in the scientific

42
00:02:43,240 --> 00:02:44,440
literature.

43
00:02:44,440 --> 00:02:45,440
So here goes.

44
00:02:45,440 --> 00:02:46,440
The consensus.

45
00:02:46,440 --> 00:02:51,800
97% of scientists agree on climate change.

46
00:02:51,800 --> 00:02:55,440
As I've said many times, science isn't decided by consensus.

47
00:02:55,440 --> 00:02:59,700
After all, not all scientists agree that the Earth is billions of years old or that animals

48
00:02:59,700 --> 00:03:02,920
evolved or that HIV causes AIDS.

49
00:03:02,920 --> 00:03:04,460
But sorry, Steve, what do you say?

50
00:03:04,460 --> 00:03:06,260
Science isn't determined by consensus.

51
00:03:06,260 --> 00:03:07,420
It's determined by truth.

52
00:03:07,420 --> 00:03:11,060
There might have been consensus that the Earth was flat among certain circles.

53
00:03:11,060 --> 00:03:12,060
Truth revealed that it wasn't.

54
00:03:12,060 --> 00:03:13,900
Yes, he's absolutely right.

55
00:03:13,900 --> 00:03:15,840
It's not determined by consensus.

56
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:20,400
Although, come on, it's not determined by revealed truth either.

57
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:25,320
Science isn't religion, so it's determined by evidence, what's known as observation

58
00:03:25,320 --> 00:03:27,440
and inference.

59
00:03:27,440 --> 00:03:31,040
Scientific theories get accepted and made part of the teaching curriculum, not because

60
00:03:31,040 --> 00:03:35,120
most scientists vote for them, but because they're supported by what's called the

61
00:03:35,120 --> 00:03:41,160
overwhelming preponderance of evidence, which is published in respected scientific journals.

62
00:03:41,160 --> 00:03:46,060
I explained this last year in my video Scientific Consensus and Arguments from Authority.

63
00:03:46,060 --> 00:03:51,500
So if you're curious to know why some hypotheses get accepted and others fall by the wayside,

64
00:03:51,500 --> 00:03:53,140
then take a look.

65
00:03:53,140 --> 00:03:58,240
And if you don't like the system, don't blame me, I'm just telling you how it works.

66
00:03:58,240 --> 00:04:02,180
And it does work because it's shown us the link between natural selection and evolution,

67
00:04:02,180 --> 00:04:07,420
between HIV and AIDS, plate tectonics and earthquakes, and yes, carbon dioxide and global

68
00:04:07,420 --> 00:04:08,660
temperature.

69
00:04:08,660 --> 00:04:12,780
You can't praise the method for giving us the theories you like and then say the method

70
00:04:12,780 --> 00:04:16,420
doesn't work when it gives us a theory you don't like.

71
00:04:16,420 --> 00:04:21,140
But on the question of whether these theories are decided by consensus, they're not.

72
00:04:21,140 --> 00:04:25,500
And no poll of scientists, whoever that might be, has ever been taken.

73
00:04:25,500 --> 00:04:29,220
So I agree, Steve, this myth is busted.

74
00:04:29,220 --> 00:04:30,220
Myth number two.

75
00:04:30,220 --> 00:04:31,980
The ice sheets are melting.

76
00:04:31,980 --> 00:04:32,980
Truth.

77
00:04:32,980 --> 00:04:37,260
The Antarctic ice sheets are actually growing by billions of tonnes per year.

78
00:04:37,260 --> 00:04:39,820
Yes, that's according to a study by NASA.

79
00:04:39,860 --> 00:04:44,380
It says Antarctic ice is growing by 82 billion tonnes a year.

80
00:04:44,380 --> 00:04:47,840
And of course, researchers have a very good idea as to why that's happening.

81
00:04:47,840 --> 00:04:50,580
But of course, there are two major ice sheets on Earth.

82
00:04:50,580 --> 00:04:53,660
One is Antarctica, the other is Greenland.

83
00:04:53,660 --> 00:04:55,380
So now, let's hear the figure for Greenland.

84
00:04:55,380 --> 00:04:58,740
According to the new analysis of satellite data, the Antarctic ice sheet showed a net

85
00:04:58,740 --> 00:05:04,380
gain of 112 billion tonnes of ice per year from 1992 to 2001.

86
00:05:04,380 --> 00:05:09,740
Actually, the most recent figure is 82 billion tonnes a year, which you'll mention in a minute.

87
00:05:09,740 --> 00:05:13,940
But now give us the figure for the Earth's other ice sheet on Greenland, so we can work

88
00:05:13,940 --> 00:05:17,500
out the net figure and see whether the myth is true or not.

89
00:05:17,500 --> 00:05:20,500
So where does the myth come from that the ice sheets are melting?

90
00:05:20,500 --> 00:05:27,460
The net gain, net gain being the key words, slowed down to only 82 billion tonnes of Greenland.

91
00:05:27,460 --> 00:05:28,460
Greenland, Steve.

92
00:05:28,460 --> 00:05:30,060
You still haven't given us the figure for Greenland.

93
00:05:30,060 --> 00:05:31,060
I know what you're thinking.

94
00:05:31,060 --> 00:05:32,060
OK, numbers are relative.

95
00:05:32,060 --> 00:05:33,060
No.

96
00:05:33,060 --> 00:05:36,980
I'm thinking, why do you only give us the figure for one ice sheet that happens to fit

97
00:05:36,980 --> 00:05:41,420
your narrative that ice sheets aren't melting, but you won't give us the figure for the other

98
00:05:41,420 --> 00:05:42,620
ice sheet?

99
00:05:42,620 --> 00:05:44,660
So I'll do it myself.

100
00:05:44,660 --> 00:05:49,180
While Antarctica may be gaining ice to the tune of 82 billion tonnes a year, Greenland

101
00:05:49,180 --> 00:05:53,900
is losing ice to the tune of 269 billion tonnes a year.

102
00:05:53,900 --> 00:05:58,820
In other words, on a global scale, the ice sheets are indeed melting away at the rate

103
00:05:58,820 --> 00:06:01,980
of around 187 billion tonnes a year.

104
00:06:01,980 --> 00:06:08,220
That's a net melt of 187 cubic kilometres of ice every year.

105
00:06:08,220 --> 00:06:11,980
And if we add in glaciers and sea ice, the net melt is even larger.

106
00:06:11,980 --> 00:06:14,700
So where does the myth come from that the ice sheets are melting?

107
00:06:14,700 --> 00:06:18,980
Well, Steve, it comes from an appraisal of measurements taken of both ice sheets, not

108
00:06:18,980 --> 00:06:23,300
just the one you happen to read because it's been copied and pasted on the blogosphere.

109
00:06:23,300 --> 00:06:27,060
It comes from people who read the scientific literature, not blogs.

110
00:06:27,060 --> 00:06:31,940
And it comes from NASA, the people whose results you believe for Antarctica, but quietly ignore

111
00:06:31,940 --> 00:06:33,240
in Greenland.

112
00:06:33,240 --> 00:06:37,400
It comes from people who want to see the whole picture, not just a part of the picture that

113
00:06:37,400 --> 00:06:40,140
suits their preconceived beliefs.

114
00:06:40,140 --> 00:06:41,860
That's where the myth comes from.

115
00:06:41,860 --> 00:06:45,620
And that's why this myth is very definitely confirmed.

116
00:06:45,620 --> 00:06:47,160
Myth!

117
00:06:47,160 --> 00:06:50,060
The polar bears are dying off!

118
00:06:50,060 --> 00:06:51,640
OK.

119
00:06:51,640 --> 00:06:52,640
So what?

120
00:06:52,640 --> 00:06:53,640
Truth!

121
00:06:53,640 --> 00:06:57,220
There are possibly more of these soulless killing monsters on Earth today than ever.

122
00:06:57,220 --> 00:06:59,060
Certainly since we've begun monitoring them.

123
00:06:59,060 --> 00:07:02,300
What's that got to do with the issue of whether the Earth is warming, whether carbon dioxide

124
00:07:02,300 --> 00:07:06,620
is the cause, and whether it'll cause stronger hurricanes, increased salination, droughts

125
00:07:06,620 --> 00:07:10,740
and floods and sea level rise, and acidification of the oceans and fewer coral reefs and more

126
00:07:10,740 --> 00:07:12,680
coastal erosion?

127
00:07:12,680 --> 00:07:15,340
These are the myths you're supposed to be busting.

128
00:07:15,340 --> 00:07:17,660
But OK, let's take a look anyway.

129
00:07:17,660 --> 00:07:22,020
Crowder tells us to go to his website for his source, which I did.

130
00:07:22,020 --> 00:07:24,780
It's a blog called factcheck.org.

131
00:07:24,780 --> 00:07:29,800
It says there has indeed been a rise in polar bear numbers since the 1970s, due mainly to

132
00:07:29,800 --> 00:07:33,080
legislation banning polar bear hunting.

133
00:07:33,080 --> 00:07:37,700
And it also says many scientists believe that due to climate change and resulting environmental

134
00:07:37,700 --> 00:07:40,740
factors, the trend is reversing.

135
00:07:40,740 --> 00:07:43,180
Now remember, this is Crowder's source.

136
00:07:43,180 --> 00:07:46,980
And funnily enough, he never mentioned any of this.

137
00:07:46,980 --> 00:07:51,840
Crowder's other source from which he got this graph is, of course, another blog.

138
00:07:51,840 --> 00:07:54,660
The blogger thinks numbers may be increasing.

139
00:07:54,660 --> 00:07:56,320
And she could be right.

140
00:07:56,320 --> 00:07:59,760
My policy is not to believe everything I read in blogs.

141
00:07:59,760 --> 00:08:02,920
But both of Crowder's sources agree on one thing.

142
00:08:02,920 --> 00:08:05,280
We simply don't know for sure.

143
00:08:05,280 --> 00:08:06,280
That's not my assessment.

144
00:08:06,280 --> 00:08:08,440
I haven't got a clue either.

145
00:08:08,440 --> 00:08:11,440
That's the assessment of the blog's Crowder sites.

146
00:08:11,440 --> 00:08:16,060
So despite his revealed truth that polar bear numbers are increasing, we can chalk that

147
00:08:16,060 --> 00:08:18,320
myth down to don't know.

148
00:08:18,320 --> 00:08:21,920
And as far as the question of whether carbon dioxide is the cause of global warming is

149
00:08:21,920 --> 00:08:26,420
concerned, the number of polar bears is totally irrelevant.

150
00:08:26,420 --> 00:08:27,420
Myth number four.

151
00:08:27,420 --> 00:08:29,400
Our current climate models are accurate.

152
00:08:29,400 --> 00:08:33,440
Crowder doesn't actually address the myth he set up, but he does talk about a variety

153
00:08:33,440 --> 00:08:34,440
of other things.

154
00:08:34,440 --> 00:08:38,400
We rely on a few organizations for these predictions, one of which is NOAA.

155
00:08:38,400 --> 00:08:43,940
They can't even accurately predict how many hurricanes there will be this year in Florida.

156
00:08:43,940 --> 00:08:45,580
That's right, they can't.

157
00:08:45,580 --> 00:08:47,320
What a shame that wasn't the myth.

158
00:08:47,320 --> 00:08:51,160
Over 300 scientists are imploring lawmakers to investigate NOAA.

159
00:08:51,160 --> 00:08:52,400
Well, not quite.

160
00:08:52,400 --> 00:08:56,880
The list includes Christopher Monckton, who's a politician, and John Coleman, who graduated

161
00:08:56,880 --> 00:09:01,120
in media studies, and of course Tim Ball, who claims once again to have been a professor

162
00:09:01,120 --> 00:09:05,040
of climatology when, in fact, he was a professor of geography.

163
00:09:05,040 --> 00:09:11,760
But anyway, these people claim NOAA wrongly adjusted temperature data in this 2015 paper.

164
00:09:11,760 --> 00:09:16,520
So why didn't these 300 signatories simply write a response paper pointing out what they

165
00:09:16,520 --> 00:09:18,800
saw as flaws in the NOAA methodology?

166
00:09:18,800 --> 00:09:20,400
Who knows?

167
00:09:20,400 --> 00:09:25,400
Whatever the reason, this still isn't the myth Crowder tasked himself with busting.

168
00:09:25,400 --> 00:09:30,240
So many predictions being wrong, including, by the way, nearly all of the predictions

169
00:09:30,240 --> 00:09:33,720
made in Al Gore's Oscar-nominated An Inconvenient Truth.

170
00:09:33,720 --> 00:09:37,400
Mistakes in Al Gore's movie is evidence that climate research has got things wrong?

171
00:09:37,400 --> 00:09:38,780
Seriously, Steve?

172
00:09:38,780 --> 00:09:42,880
Which predictions to rattle off a few like Mount Kilimanjaro as we address the polar

173
00:09:42,880 --> 00:09:43,880
bears?

174
00:09:43,880 --> 00:09:45,160
North Pole still has ice.

175
00:09:45,160 --> 00:09:49,520
But you can't then make the leap that because people get things wrong in the public media

176
00:09:49,520 --> 00:09:52,540
that the science must therefore be wrong.

177
00:09:52,540 --> 00:09:57,480
Researchers can't be held responsible for the mistakes made by Al Gore and environmentalists

178
00:09:57,480 --> 00:10:01,120
any more than they can be held responsible for the mistakes made by the bloggers you

179
00:10:01,120 --> 00:10:02,120
use as sources.

180
00:10:02,120 --> 00:10:07,080
But you can go back to the 70s and find other doomsday predictions, like global cooling.

181
00:10:07,080 --> 00:10:11,160
But again, what's that got to do with climate researchers?

182
00:10:11,160 --> 00:10:15,260
Never mind the predictions made by movies, books, magazines and individuals with the

183
00:10:15,260 --> 00:10:20,760
scientific acumen of Cheez Whiz, let's deal with the predictions of real, actual climate

184
00:10:20,760 --> 00:10:24,840
researchers, as published in the scientific literature.

185
00:10:24,840 --> 00:10:27,280
Isn't that what you're trying to prove is wrong?

186
00:10:27,280 --> 00:10:32,760
The vast majority of published papers in the 1960s and 70s were predicting warming, not

187
00:10:32,760 --> 00:10:36,120
cooling, by a margin of 44 to 7.

188
00:10:36,120 --> 00:10:40,480
And the reason they gave for this predicted warming was increasing levels of CO2.

189
00:10:40,480 --> 00:10:46,080
Due to our release through factories and automobiles every year of more than 6 billion tonnes of

190
00:10:46,080 --> 00:10:52,200
carbon dioxide, which helps air absorb heat from the sun, our atmosphere seems to be getting

191
00:10:52,200 --> 00:10:53,200
warmer.

192
00:10:53,200 --> 00:10:54,200
This is bad.

193
00:10:54,200 --> 00:10:59,640
Well, it's been calculated a few degrees rise in the Earth's temperature would melt the

194
00:10:59,640 --> 00:11:01,100
polar ice cap.

195
00:11:01,100 --> 00:11:05,640
That isn't a recent propaganda message from Greenpeace, it was an educational film shown

196
00:11:05,640 --> 00:11:09,240
in schools and colleges in 1958.

197
00:11:09,240 --> 00:11:13,240
And of course those predictions have proved 100% accurate.

198
00:11:13,240 --> 00:11:18,600
Ice sheets, glaciers and sea ice are melting, and the rate of melt is accelerating.

199
00:11:18,600 --> 00:11:23,240
Temperatures have been rising to record levels, even when increased pollution and lower solar

200
00:11:23,240 --> 00:11:26,600
output should have been sending temperatures lower.

201
00:11:26,600 --> 00:11:30,840
And while we all tend to focus on atmospheric temperatures, remember that climate scientists

202
00:11:30,840 --> 00:11:32,640
look at the Earth as a whole.

203
00:11:32,640 --> 00:11:38,340
90% of the extra heat is going into the oceans, which have also fulfilled the predictions

204
00:11:38,340 --> 00:11:39,740
of warming.

205
00:11:39,740 --> 00:11:44,500
The only thing climate models can't do is predict short term changes, because in the

206
00:11:44,500 --> 00:11:48,800
short term there are lots of minor fluctuations that affect measurements like temperature

207
00:11:48,800 --> 00:11:50,340
and sea level.

208
00:11:50,340 --> 00:11:55,220
It's like me trying to predict on January 1st in Denver whether the temperature on February

209
00:11:55,220 --> 00:11:57,780
1st will be warmer or colder.

210
00:11:57,780 --> 00:11:59,480
It's almost impossible.

211
00:11:59,480 --> 00:12:03,980
But looking further into the future it gets easier, and I can confidently predict that

212
00:12:03,980 --> 00:12:09,460
the temperature in Denver will be higher in May and much higher in July.

213
00:12:09,460 --> 00:12:13,660
That's because over short periods of time the increasing warming of the sun may not

214
00:12:13,660 --> 00:12:16,180
overcome short term fluctuations.

215
00:12:16,180 --> 00:12:21,300
But over a longer period of time these background fluctuations become less significant.

216
00:12:21,300 --> 00:12:26,280
And while temperatures may go up and down on a daily or even weekly basis, I can confidently

217
00:12:26,280 --> 00:12:30,980
predict that every month in Denver between January and July is going to be warmer on

218
00:12:30,980 --> 00:12:33,340
average than the previous one.

219
00:12:33,340 --> 00:12:38,540
So what climate models can do, and have done very successfully, is predict the long term

220
00:12:38,540 --> 00:12:40,100
trend.

221
00:12:40,100 --> 00:12:44,840
When geologists applied the model to the past 500 million years, it fit almost perfectly

222
00:12:44,840 --> 00:12:48,300
with the continuous changes in the Earth's climate.

223
00:12:48,300 --> 00:12:52,320
Geologists discovered that changing levels of carbon dioxide explained nearly all the

224
00:12:52,320 --> 00:12:54,540
long term changes in temperature.

225
00:12:54,540 --> 00:12:59,100
The model explained the so-called faint sun paradox – that's the problem of why the

226
00:12:59,100 --> 00:13:04,300
Earth was much hotter than today at a time when the sun was much, much weaker.

227
00:13:04,300 --> 00:13:08,460
It was because CO2 levels were many times higher than today.

228
00:13:08,460 --> 00:13:12,880
The model explained why the Earth escaped from a deep freeze during the Precambrian.

229
00:13:12,880 --> 00:13:17,700
It was because of a slow accumulation of carbon dioxide from volcanoes.

230
00:13:17,700 --> 00:13:23,020
The model explained why the Earth has maintained a Goldilocks climate ever since, because as

231
00:13:23,020 --> 00:13:28,080
the sun has been getting increasingly hotter, the high levels of carbon dioxide have gradually

232
00:13:28,080 --> 00:13:33,720
been taken out of the atmosphere and buried as limestone, coal and oil.

233
00:13:33,720 --> 00:13:38,160
And the model solved the problem of why the Earth warmed so much after each glaciation

234
00:13:38,160 --> 00:13:42,480
given that the increased insulation that sparked them wasn't strong enough to melt the ice

235
00:13:42,480 --> 00:13:43,480
sheets.

236
00:13:43,480 --> 00:13:48,080
In fact, the climate model works so well that carbon dioxide is being called the Earth's

237
00:13:48,080 --> 00:13:52,680
thermostat and the long term regulator of the Earth's climate.

238
00:13:52,680 --> 00:13:56,880
We even understand the mechanism by which carbon dioxide can do this.

239
00:13:56,880 --> 00:14:01,240
It's in peer-reviewed research papers going back over a hundred years, when it was first

240
00:14:01,240 --> 00:14:06,440
discovered that carbon dioxide absorbs long-wave radiation, and a physicist calculated as far

241
00:14:06,440 --> 00:14:11,340
back as the 19th century that if the carbon dioxide level ever got high enough, it could

242
00:14:11,340 --> 00:14:13,880
affect the Earth's climate.

243
00:14:13,880 --> 00:14:16,300
Talk about a prescient prediction!

244
00:14:16,300 --> 00:14:20,880
So notwithstanding the fact that Al Gore and assorted environmentalists often make wacky

245
00:14:20,880 --> 00:14:26,680
predictions that are wrong, as far as researchers in the field of glaciology, atmospheric physics,

246
00:14:26,680 --> 00:14:31,360
oceanography, geology, paleoclimatology, and all the other assorted disciplines that

247
00:14:31,360 --> 00:14:37,720
have built up this model are concerned, this myth is confirmed.

248
00:14:37,720 --> 00:14:44,040
National or international government is the only entity capable of solving imminent climate

249
00:14:44,040 --> 00:14:45,040
change catastrophe.

250
00:14:45,040 --> 00:14:49,080
Well, as I said at the beginning, that's not only a political question, it's tackling a

251
00:14:49,080 --> 00:14:51,980
problem that you say doesn't exist.

252
00:14:51,980 --> 00:14:54,980
So here's my suggestion for your next video, Steve.

253
00:14:54,980 --> 00:14:57,220
What's the issues you put up at the beginning?

254
00:14:57,220 --> 00:14:58,940
Is the Earth warming?

255
00:14:58,940 --> 00:15:02,340
Is carbon dioxide from fossil fuel burning the cause?

256
00:15:02,340 --> 00:15:06,380
Will the result be higher sea levels, stronger hurricanes, increased salination, drought

257
00:15:06,380 --> 00:15:10,380
and flood, acidification of the oceans, and coastal erosion?

258
00:15:10,380 --> 00:15:15,500
These are the things that matter to us, because they'll affect our food supply, our infrastructure,

259
00:15:15,500 --> 00:15:18,380
and most importantly, our wallets.

260
00:15:18,380 --> 00:15:23,060
That matters more to people than the number of bloody polar bears.

261
00:15:23,060 --> 00:15:26,860
Put these questions up as myths and see if you can bust them.

262
00:15:26,860 --> 00:15:31,300
But don't just cite a blog and tell people Fred Blogger doesn't believe it, so that proves

263
00:15:31,300 --> 00:15:32,300
it's not true.

264
00:15:32,300 --> 00:15:35,860
You're an intelligent man, dig a little deeper.

265
00:15:35,860 --> 00:15:38,380
Check the blogger's source and verify it.

266
00:15:38,380 --> 00:15:42,340
Find out what the science says by checking the scientific literature, and see if there's

267
00:15:42,340 --> 00:15:47,240
a discrepancy or an explanation of why the blogger might have got his facts wrong.

268
00:15:47,240 --> 00:15:51,960
Look at all the evidence, not just the bits that give you the answer you want.

269
00:15:51,960 --> 00:15:56,960
With the deepest respect, talking louder doesn't mean you're better informed.
