00:00.000 --> 00:11.200
Censorship blocks the expression of good ideas and inhibits the scrutiny of bad ones. It

00:11.200 --> 00:19.280
retards civilization. Our modern Western civilization is an icon to the worth and fruits that freedom

00:19.280 --> 00:25.240
of expression and freedom of speech can deliver. However, still in the background, there are

00:25.240 --> 00:31.400
those who would happily promote censorship, either legal or illegal, to protect their

00:31.400 --> 00:37.820
ideas from public analysis. Creationists have now clearly adopted the abuse of a legal instrument

00:37.820 --> 00:42.920
constructed for the protection of copyrighted material, the Digital Millennium Copyright

00:42.920 --> 00:49.240
Act or DMCA, as their weapon of choice in attempting to censor those critical of their

00:49.240 --> 00:57.080
beliefs. Over the last year or so, at least five creationist organizations and individuals

00:57.080 --> 01:04.920
have filed multiple, multiple baseless DMCAs against work critical of them. All of those

01:04.920 --> 01:10.340
that were opposed were won by individuals who recognized the danger posed by allowing

01:10.340 --> 01:19.020
such abuse. The offending creationist organizations and individuals include Creation Science Evangelism

01:19.020 --> 01:25.100
founded of course by the convicted fraudster Kent Hovind, Illustria Media, a subsidiary

01:25.100 --> 01:30.440
of the Discover Institute, that's the creationist organization at the core of the intelligent

01:30.440 --> 01:38.660
design movement, Answers in Genesis and their front man Ken Ham, Venom Fang X, of course,

01:38.660 --> 01:46.520
who filed over 150 DMCAs, and the Eternal Media, among others. In response to this,

01:46.520 --> 01:53.120
we have formed a now multinational alliance. We have formed this alliance as a defense

01:53.120 --> 01:59.460
mechanism against the abuse of the DMCA. We have now pulled our legal knowledge and it

01:59.460 --> 02:04.420
should be borne in mind that even as individuals we were hammering these creationists on every

02:04.420 --> 02:10.940
baseless DMCA they filed. Secondly, we have decided to immediately name and shame any

02:10.940 --> 02:19.180
creationist organization who files a baseless DMCA claim. If you try filing a baseless DMCA

02:19.180 --> 02:26.600
claim, it is likely, given that we have maybe 100,000 subscribers between us, that maybe

02:26.600 --> 02:32.800
a million people will know about it within a week. Finally, it should be stated that

02:32.800 --> 02:38.200
every time you file and lose a DMCA claim, you just bring that time one day closer when

02:38.200 --> 02:44.580
one of you will end up in front of a judge for this. We defend reason, we defend western

02:44.580 --> 02:51.860
values, and we defend freedom of speech from those who were limited for dogmatic reasons.

02:51.860 --> 02:59.420
And now, due to this pattern of creationist behavior, we do it as one. The following is

02:59.420 --> 03:01.100
a message from a few of our number.

03:08.200 --> 03:19.340
Particular organizations and individuals appear to have demonstrated a track record of misusing

03:19.340 --> 03:24.980
DMCA's to censor comment and criticism. Even if you receive legal advice that you are likely

03:24.980 --> 03:30.220
to be protected under the Fair Use provisions, the idea of fighting a DMCA is not simply

03:30.220 --> 03:35.160
a legal issue. It's a commitment to stick it out against these organizations and their

03:35.160 --> 03:40.540
underhanded tactics to avoid criticism of their misinformation. After all, you have

03:40.540 --> 03:46.340
to hand over to them your personal details when you lodge the counterclaim. When I made

03:46.340 --> 03:51.260
that decision to stand up and fight against this misuse of DMCA's, I found that I was

03:51.260 --> 03:56.780
not alone. I'm not sure if we realize the potential we all have as a collective. I'm

03:56.780 --> 04:02.100
not sure if we realize that a collective action on all our parts is far more powerful than

04:02.100 --> 04:08.720
the sum of all our individual actions. The time for tolerating this misuse is at an end.

04:08.720 --> 04:13.720
Please feature, favorite and share this video in addition to the copies on our other channels.

04:13.720 --> 04:22.720
I grew up in a pre-internet world where anytime you got into a discussion on any topic, whether

04:22.720 --> 04:27.840
it was history, science, religion, matters of social politics and scandal, whatever the

04:27.840 --> 04:31.200
subject was, wherever you were talking to, you might pull up whatever urban legend was

04:31.300 --> 04:35.700
necessary to back up his story at the time. There was no way on the fly to figure out

04:35.700 --> 04:40.700
what information was actually factual and what was just made up on the spot, statistic-wise.

04:40.700 --> 04:44.700
The only way you could find out, the only way you could find out was if you went to

04:44.700 --> 04:51.200
the library all day and perhaps not even then. So you had to give them, so you had to give

04:51.200 --> 04:55.300
them the benefit of the doubt, especially if they seemed morally outraged by whatever

04:55.300 --> 05:01.600
fact they just coughed up. Back then, propaganda and emotional arguments with made-up statistics

05:01.600 --> 05:06.800
on the spot usually won. These are the people who want to bridle internet information, the

05:06.800 --> 05:10.800
free expression of ideas that prohibit or limit their spread through the general public.

05:10.800 --> 05:14.800
Controlling information and suppressing ideas is the means to manipulate the minds of the

05:14.800 --> 05:18.800
masses, but ethnocentric bigotry and religious and nationalist propag-

05:18.800 --> 05:27.300
But ethnocentric bigotry and religious or nationalist propaganda collapse in an unrestricted

05:27.300 --> 05:31.300
global forum. That's why some would seek to silence, censor, restrict and restrain

05:31.300 --> 05:36.300
contrary comments while we need to preserve and promote your right to say whatever you

05:36.300 --> 05:40.300
want, whoever you are, no matter how wrong I can show you to be.

05:48.800 --> 05:53.300
Many of my viewers know that I freely allow any and all comments, ratings and responses

05:53.300 --> 05:58.300
on my channel, and this is because I believe the only way to settle a debate is to allow

05:58.300 --> 06:03.300
everyone the right to speak. After all, when debate is genuinely free, the truth will always

06:03.300 --> 06:07.800
win. But there are those out there who seek to silence the opinions of others, because

06:07.800 --> 06:12.800
their agenda is threatened by rational inquiry. That they refuse to acknowledge criticism

06:12.800 --> 06:18.300
is bad enough, but their rampant misuse of the DMCA to extend their branch of censorship

06:18.300 --> 06:22.800
to YouTube accounts of those who refute them is completely unacceptable.

06:22.800 --> 06:27.800
Sadly, because of these actions, free speech must be continually fought for. I urge you

06:27.800 --> 06:32.800
to oppose DMCA abuse and stand up for free speech on YouTube.

06:48.800 --> 06:53.800
And that's what I love about YouTube. It's a worldwide open forum that has the potential

06:53.800 --> 06:58.800
to change minds across the world and present new opinions to people who've been cloistered

06:58.800 --> 07:03.800
in narrow-minded communities and repressive regimes. At least, that's how it's supposed

07:03.800 --> 07:08.800
to work. And that's why I'm standing against the false filing of DMCAs and urging YouTube

07:08.800 --> 07:13.800
to take action against people who want to shut down channels and videos that challenge

07:14.300 --> 07:19.300
their beliefs. I have no objection to the legitimate protection of copyright, but this

07:19.300 --> 07:24.300
is an issue of fair use for the purpose of academic debate. In several cases, especially

07:24.300 --> 07:29.300
those related to creationist preacher Kent Hovind, Hovind himself specifically says that

07:29.300 --> 07:35.300
his videos are not copyrighted. But when some YouTubers used clips of his material in order

07:35.300 --> 07:40.300
to refute Hovind, they were shut down because of false claims of breach of copyright.

07:40.800 --> 07:44.800
Let's get this straight. This kind of action has nothing to do with the protection of copyrighted

07:44.800 --> 07:49.800
material. It's a tactic designed purely and simply to shut up dissent, to silence

07:49.800 --> 07:54.800
critics and stamp on freedom of speech. If this is allowed to continue, then YouTube

07:54.800 --> 07:59.800
will eventually become just a boring mouthpiece of organizations that screen comments and

07:59.800 --> 08:04.800
shut down critics. This is your medium, people. Stand up for it.

08:11.300 --> 08:16.300
Hi, this is Vito Omega and I'm stating my support for the campaign against the abuse

08:16.300 --> 08:23.300
of the DMCA. Censorship is basically when you silence people who are critical of your

08:23.300 --> 08:28.800
opinions. The only time when censorship works is when you are infallible. Do you know anyone

08:28.800 --> 08:34.800
who's infallible? Fight DMCA abuse. Fight censorship. This is your YouTube. Stand up for it.

08:34.800 --> 08:44.800
This is Don Exodus. Censorship is a tool used by simple minds to mislead and misinform.

08:44.800 --> 08:48.800
If the facts and reason aren't on your side, it's very easy to win a debate if there's

08:48.800 --> 08:52.800
nobody to debate against. Please, oppose censorship in all its forms, whether it's

08:52.800 --> 08:57.800
a false filing of DMCA copyright claims or simply deleting or disapproving of comments

08:57.800 --> 08:59.800
that disagree with your videos.

09:04.800 --> 09:21.800
CDK007 here. As many of you know, my channel is about the free exchange of ideas. I don't

09:21.800 --> 09:26.800
censor voting, comments, or video responses. However, there are those who are more than

09:26.800 --> 09:32.800
willing to suppress the speech of others in order to further their agenda. Since its inception,

09:32.800 --> 09:37.800
a small minority of people have attempted to manipulate YouTube to censor ideas they

09:37.800 --> 09:42.800
don't necessarily agree with. They have used a variety of techniques, but the false

09:42.800 --> 09:48.800
filing of DMCA's is the most insidious. We don't need to sit back and let these

09:48.800 --> 09:52.800
individuals steal our freedom. If we join together, we can convince YouTube to change

09:52.800 --> 09:57.800
its policies. How do I know this can work? After people realized they could suppress

09:57.800 --> 10:02.800
others by repeatedly down-thumbing every single comment under a video, we complained

10:02.800 --> 10:07.800
and YouTube responded. This time I'm asking you to do more than just think about it.

10:07.800 --> 10:12.800
Together, we can make a difference.

10:12.800 --> 10:16.800
We would like to hear from you if you have been served with a DMCA notice that you consider

10:16.800 --> 10:21.800
was issued in order to prohibit free expression rather than to protect copyright. We would

10:21.800 --> 10:25.800
like to know how often it is happening, who served these notices, what happened as a result.

10:25.800 --> 10:30.800
We believe that opportunity for education, freedom of expression and freedom of speech

10:30.800 --> 10:34.800
are causes worth protecting. We want to do what we can to protect them. Please help us

10:34.800 --> 10:39.800
do that. Feature, favorite, share, rate and comment on the copies of this video on all

10:39.800 --> 10:41.800
our channels. Thank you.
