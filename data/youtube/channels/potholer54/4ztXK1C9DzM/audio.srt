1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:11,200
Censorship blocks the expression of good ideas and inhibits the scrutiny of bad ones. It

2
00:00:11,200 --> 00:00:19,280
retards civilization. Our modern Western civilization is an icon to the worth and fruits that freedom

3
00:00:19,280 --> 00:00:25,240
of expression and freedom of speech can deliver. However, still in the background, there are

4
00:00:25,240 --> 00:00:31,400
those who would happily promote censorship, either legal or illegal, to protect their

5
00:00:31,400 --> 00:00:37,820
ideas from public analysis. Creationists have now clearly adopted the abuse of a legal instrument

6
00:00:37,820 --> 00:00:42,920
constructed for the protection of copyrighted material, the Digital Millennium Copyright

7
00:00:42,920 --> 00:00:49,240
Act or DMCA, as their weapon of choice in attempting to censor those critical of their

8
00:00:49,240 --> 00:00:57,080
beliefs. Over the last year or so, at least five creationist organizations and individuals

9
00:00:57,080 --> 00:01:04,920
have filed multiple, multiple baseless DMCAs against work critical of them. All of those

10
00:01:04,920 --> 00:01:10,340
that were opposed were won by individuals who recognized the danger posed by allowing

11
00:01:10,340 --> 00:01:19,020
such abuse. The offending creationist organizations and individuals include Creation Science Evangelism

12
00:01:19,020 --> 00:01:25,100
founded of course by the convicted fraudster Kent Hovind, Illustria Media, a subsidiary

13
00:01:25,100 --> 00:01:30,440
of the Discover Institute, that's the creationist organization at the core of the intelligent

14
00:01:30,440 --> 00:01:38,660
design movement, Answers in Genesis and their front man Ken Ham, Venom Fang X, of course,

15
00:01:38,660 --> 00:01:46,520
who filed over 150 DMCAs, and the Eternal Media, among others. In response to this,

16
00:01:46,520 --> 00:01:53,120
we have formed a now multinational alliance. We have formed this alliance as a defense

17
00:01:53,120 --> 00:01:59,460
mechanism against the abuse of the DMCA. We have now pulled our legal knowledge and it

18
00:01:59,460 --> 00:02:04,420
should be borne in mind that even as individuals we were hammering these creationists on every

19
00:02:04,420 --> 00:02:10,940
baseless DMCA they filed. Secondly, we have decided to immediately name and shame any

20
00:02:10,940 --> 00:02:19,180
creationist organization who files a baseless DMCA claim. If you try filing a baseless DMCA

21
00:02:19,180 --> 00:02:26,600
claim, it is likely, given that we have maybe 100,000 subscribers between us, that maybe

22
00:02:26,600 --> 00:02:32,800
a million people will know about it within a week. Finally, it should be stated that

23
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:38,200
every time you file and lose a DMCA claim, you just bring that time one day closer when

24
00:02:38,200 --> 00:02:44,580
one of you will end up in front of a judge for this. We defend reason, we defend western

25
00:02:44,580 --> 00:02:51,860
values, and we defend freedom of speech from those who were limited for dogmatic reasons.

26
00:02:51,860 --> 00:02:59,420
And now, due to this pattern of creationist behavior, we do it as one. The following is

27
00:02:59,420 --> 00:03:01,100
a message from a few of our number.

28
00:03:08,200 --> 00:03:19,340
Particular organizations and individuals appear to have demonstrated a track record of misusing

29
00:03:19,340 --> 00:03:24,980
DMCA's to censor comment and criticism. Even if you receive legal advice that you are likely

30
00:03:24,980 --> 00:03:30,220
to be protected under the Fair Use provisions, the idea of fighting a DMCA is not simply

31
00:03:30,220 --> 00:03:35,160
a legal issue. It's a commitment to stick it out against these organizations and their

32
00:03:35,160 --> 00:03:40,540
underhanded tactics to avoid criticism of their misinformation. After all, you have

33
00:03:40,540 --> 00:03:46,340
to hand over to them your personal details when you lodge the counterclaim. When I made

34
00:03:46,340 --> 00:03:51,260
that decision to stand up and fight against this misuse of DMCA's, I found that I was

35
00:03:51,260 --> 00:03:56,780
not alone. I'm not sure if we realize the potential we all have as a collective. I'm

36
00:03:56,780 --> 00:04:02,100
not sure if we realize that a collective action on all our parts is far more powerful than

37
00:04:02,100 --> 00:04:08,720
the sum of all our individual actions. The time for tolerating this misuse is at an end.

Please feature, favorite and share this video in addition to the copies on our other channels.

39
00:04:13,720 --> 00:04:22,720
I grew up in a pre-internet world where anytime you got into a discussion on any topic, whether

40
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:27,840
it was history, science, religion, matters of social politics and scandal, whatever the

41
00:04:27,840 --> 00:04:31,200
subject was, wherever you were talking to, you might pull up whatever urban legend was

42
00:04:31,300 --> 00:04:35,700
necessary to back up his story at the time. There was no way on the fly to figure out

43
00:04:35,700 --> 00:04:40,700
what information was actually factual and what was just made up on the spot, statistic-wise.

44
00:04:40,700 --> 00:04:44,700
The only way you could find out, the only way you could find out was if you went to

45
00:04:44,700 --> 00:04:51,200
the library all day and perhaps not even then. So you had to give them, so you had to give

46
00:04:51,200 --> 00:04:55,300
them the benefit of the doubt, especially if they seemed morally outraged by whatever

47
00:04:55,300 --> 00:05:01,600
fact they just coughed up. Back then, propaganda and emotional arguments with made-up statistics

48
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:06,800
on the spot usually won. These are the people who want to bridle internet information, the

49
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:10,800
free expression of ideas that prohibit or limit their spread through the general public.

50
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:14,800
Controlling information and suppressing ideas is the means to manipulate the minds of the

51
00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:18,800
masses, but ethnocentric bigotry and religious and nationalist propag-

52
00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:27,300
But ethnocentric bigotry and religious or nationalist propaganda collapse in an unrestricted

53
00:05:27,300 --> 00:05:31,300
global forum. That's why some would seek to silence, censor, restrict and restrain

54
00:05:31,300 --> 00:05:36,300
contrary comments while we need to preserve and promote your right to say whatever you

55
00:05:36,300 --> 00:05:40,300
want, whoever you are, no matter how wrong I can show you to be.

56
00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:53,300
Many of my viewers know that I freely allow any and all comments, ratings and responses

57
00:05:53,300 --> 00:05:58,300
on my channel, and this is because I believe the only way to settle a debate is to allow

58
00:05:58,300 --> 00:06:03,300
everyone the right to speak. After all, when debate is genuinely free, the truth will always

59
00:06:03,300 --> 00:06:07,800
win. But there are those out there who seek to silence the opinions of others, because

60
00:06:07,800 --> 00:06:12,800
their agenda is threatened by rational inquiry. That they refuse to acknowledge criticism

61
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:18,300
is bad enough, but their rampant misuse of the DMCA to extend their branch of censorship

62
00:06:18,300 --> 00:06:22,800
to YouTube accounts of those who refute them is completely unacceptable.

63
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:27,800
Sadly, because of these actions, free speech must be continually fought for. I urge you

64
00:06:27,800 --> 00:06:32,800
to oppose DMCA abuse and stand up for free speech on YouTube.

65
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:53,800
And that's what I love about YouTube. It's a worldwide open forum that has the potential

66
00:06:53,800 --> 00:06:58,800
to change minds across the world and present new opinions to people who've been cloistered

67
00:06:58,800 --> 00:07:03,800
in narrow-minded communities and repressive regimes. At least, that's how it's supposed

68
00:07:03,800 --> 00:07:08,800
to work. And that's why I'm standing against the false filing of DMCAs and urging YouTube

69
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:13,800
to take action against people who want to shut down channels and videos that challenge

70
00:07:14,300 --> 00:07:19,300
their beliefs. I have no objection to the legitimate protection of copyright, but this

71
00:07:19,300 --> 00:07:24,300
is an issue of fair use for the purpose of academic debate. In several cases, especially

72
00:07:24,300 --> 00:07:29,300
those related to creationist preacher Kent Hovind, Hovind himself specifically says that

73
00:07:29,300 --> 00:07:35,300
his videos are not copyrighted. But when some YouTubers used clips of his material in order

74
00:07:35,300 --> 00:07:40,300
to refute Hovind, they were shut down because of false claims of breach of copyright.

75
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:44,800
Let's get this straight. This kind of action has nothing to do with the protection of copyrighted

76
00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:49,800
material. It's a tactic designed purely and simply to shut up dissent, to silence

77
00:07:49,800 --> 00:07:54,800
critics and stamp on freedom of speech. If this is allowed to continue, then YouTube

78
00:07:54,800 --> 00:07:59,800
will eventually become just a boring mouthpiece of organizations that screen comments and

79
00:07:59,800 --> 00:08:04,800
shut down critics. This is your medium, people. Stand up for it.

80
00:08:11,300 --> 00:08:16,300
Hi, this is Vito Omega and I'm stating my support for the campaign against the abuse

81
00:08:16,300 --> 00:08:23,300
of the DMCA. Censorship is basically when you silence people who are critical of your

82
00:08:23,300 --> 00:08:28,800
opinions. The only time when censorship works is when you are infallible. Do you know anyone

83
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:34,800
who's infallible? Fight DMCA abuse. Fight censorship. This is your YouTube. Stand up for it.

84
00:08:34,800 --> 00:08:44,800
This is Don Exodus. Censorship is a tool used by simple minds to mislead and misinform.

85
00:08:44,800 --> 00:08:48,800
If the facts and reason aren't on your side, it's very easy to win a debate if there's

86
00:08:48,800 --> 00:08:52,800
nobody to debate against. Please, oppose censorship in all its forms, whether it's

87
00:08:52,800 --> 00:08:57,800
a false filing of DMCA copyright claims or simply deleting or disapproving of comments

88
00:08:57,800 --> 00:08:59,800
that disagree with your videos.

89
00:09:04,800 --> 00:09:21,800
CDK007 here. As many of you know, my channel is about the free exchange of ideas. I don't

90
00:09:21,800 --> 00:09:26,800
censor voting, comments, or video responses. However, there are those who are more than

91
00:09:26,800 --> 00:09:32,800
willing to suppress the speech of others in order to further their agenda. Since its inception,

92
00:09:32,800 --> 00:09:37,800
a small minority of people have attempted to manipulate YouTube to censor ideas they

93
00:09:37,800 --> 00:09:42,800
don't necessarily agree with. They have used a variety of techniques, but the false

94
00:09:42,800 --> 00:09:48,800
filing of DMCA's is the most insidious. We don't need to sit back and let these

95
00:09:48,800 --> 00:09:52,800
individuals steal our freedom. If we join together, we can convince YouTube to change

96
00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:57,800
its policies. How do I know this can work? After people realized they could suppress

97
00:09:57,800 --> 00:10:02,800
others by repeatedly down-thumbing every single comment under a video, we complained

98
00:10:02,800 --> 00:10:07,800
and YouTube responded. This time I'm asking you to do more than just think about it.

99
00:10:07,800 --> 00:10:12,800
Together, we can make a difference.

100
00:10:12,800 --> 00:10:16,800
We would like to hear from you if you have been served with a DMCA notice that you consider

101
00:10:16,800 --> 00:10:21,800
was issued in order to prohibit free expression rather than to protect copyright. We would

102
00:10:21,800 --> 00:10:25,800
like to know how often it is happening, who served these notices, what happened as a result.

103
00:10:25,800 --> 00:10:30,800
We believe that opportunity for education, freedom of expression and freedom of speech

104
00:10:30,800 --> 00:10:34,800
are causes worth protecting. We want to do what we can to protect them. Please help us

105
00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:39,800
do that. Feature, favorite, share, rate and comment on the copies of this video on all

106
00:10:39,800 --> 00:10:41,800
our channels. Thank you.
