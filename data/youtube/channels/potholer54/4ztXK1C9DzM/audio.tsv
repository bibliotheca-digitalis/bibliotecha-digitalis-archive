0	11200	Censorship blocks the expression of good ideas and inhibits the scrutiny of bad ones. It
11200	19280	retards civilization. Our modern Western civilization is an icon to the worth and fruits that freedom
19280	25240	of expression and freedom of speech can deliver. However, still in the background, there are
25240	31400	those who would happily promote censorship, either legal or illegal, to protect their
31400	37820	ideas from public analysis. Creationists have now clearly adopted the abuse of a legal instrument
37820	42920	constructed for the protection of copyrighted material, the Digital Millennium Copyright
42920	49240	Act or DMCA, as their weapon of choice in attempting to censor those critical of their
49240	57080	beliefs. Over the last year or so, at least five creationist organizations and individuals
57080	64920	have filed multiple, multiple baseless DMCAs against work critical of them. All of those
64920	70340	that were opposed were won by individuals who recognized the danger posed by allowing
70340	79020	such abuse. The offending creationist organizations and individuals include Creation Science Evangelism
79020	85100	founded of course by the convicted fraudster Kent Hovind, Illustria Media, a subsidiary
85100	90440	of the Discover Institute, that's the creationist organization at the core of the intelligent
90440	98660	design movement, Answers in Genesis and their front man Ken Ham, Venom Fang X, of course,
98660	106520	who filed over 150 DMCAs, and the Eternal Media, among others. In response to this,
106520	113120	we have formed a now multinational alliance. We have formed this alliance as a defense
113120	119460	mechanism against the abuse of the DMCA. We have now pulled our legal knowledge and it
119460	124420	should be borne in mind that even as individuals we were hammering these creationists on every
124420	130940	baseless DMCA they filed. Secondly, we have decided to immediately name and shame any
130940	139180	creationist organization who files a baseless DMCA claim. If you try filing a baseless DMCA
139180	146600	claim, it is likely, given that we have maybe 100,000 subscribers between us, that maybe
146600	152800	a million people will know about it within a week. Finally, it should be stated that
152800	158200	every time you file and lose a DMCA claim, you just bring that time one day closer when
158200	164580	one of you will end up in front of a judge for this. We defend reason, we defend western
164580	171860	values, and we defend freedom of speech from those who were limited for dogmatic reasons.
171860	179420	And now, due to this pattern of creationist behavior, we do it as one. The following is
179420	181100	a message from a few of our number.
188200	199340	Particular organizations and individuals appear to have demonstrated a track record of misusing
199340	204980	DMCA's to censor comment and criticism. Even if you receive legal advice that you are likely
204980	210220	to be protected under the Fair Use provisions, the idea of fighting a DMCA is not simply
210220	215160	a legal issue. It's a commitment to stick it out against these organizations and their
215160	220540	underhanded tactics to avoid criticism of their misinformation. After all, you have
220540	226340	to hand over to them your personal details when you lodge the counterclaim. When I made
226340	231260	that decision to stand up and fight against this misuse of DMCA's, I found that I was
231260	236780	not alone. I'm not sure if we realize the potential we all have as a collective. I'm
236780	242100	not sure if we realize that a collective action on all our parts is far more powerful than
242100	248720	the sum of all our individual actions. The time for tolerating this misuse is at an end.
248720	253720	Please feature, favorite and share this video in addition to the copies on our other channels.
253720	262720	I grew up in a pre-internet world where anytime you got into a discussion on any topic, whether
262720	267840	it was history, science, religion, matters of social politics and scandal, whatever the
267840	271200	subject was, wherever you were talking to, you might pull up whatever urban legend was
271300	275700	necessary to back up his story at the time. There was no way on the fly to figure out
275700	280700	what information was actually factual and what was just made up on the spot, statistic-wise.
280700	284700	The only way you could find out, the only way you could find out was if you went to
284700	291200	the library all day and perhaps not even then. So you had to give them, so you had to give
291200	295300	them the benefit of the doubt, especially if they seemed morally outraged by whatever
295300	301600	fact they just coughed up. Back then, propaganda and emotional arguments with made-up statistics
301600	306800	on the spot usually won. These are the people who want to bridle internet information, the
306800	310800	free expression of ideas that prohibit or limit their spread through the general public.
310800	314800	Controlling information and suppressing ideas is the means to manipulate the minds of the
314800	318800	masses, but ethnocentric bigotry and religious and nationalist propag-
318800	327300	But ethnocentric bigotry and religious or nationalist propaganda collapse in an unrestricted
327300	331300	global forum. That's why some would seek to silence, censor, restrict and restrain
331300	336300	contrary comments while we need to preserve and promote your right to say whatever you
336300	340300	want, whoever you are, no matter how wrong I can show you to be.
348800	353300	Many of my viewers know that I freely allow any and all comments, ratings and responses
353300	358300	on my channel, and this is because I believe the only way to settle a debate is to allow
358300	363300	everyone the right to speak. After all, when debate is genuinely free, the truth will always
363300	367800	win. But there are those out there who seek to silence the opinions of others, because
367800	372800	their agenda is threatened by rational inquiry. That they refuse to acknowledge criticism
372800	378300	is bad enough, but their rampant misuse of the DMCA to extend their branch of censorship
378300	382800	to YouTube accounts of those who refute them is completely unacceptable.
382800	387800	Sadly, because of these actions, free speech must be continually fought for. I urge you
387800	392800	to oppose DMCA abuse and stand up for free speech on YouTube.
408800	413800	And that's what I love about YouTube. It's a worldwide open forum that has the potential
413800	418800	to change minds across the world and present new opinions to people who've been cloistered
418800	423800	in narrow-minded communities and repressive regimes. At least, that's how it's supposed
423800	428800	to work. And that's why I'm standing against the false filing of DMCAs and urging YouTube
428800	433800	to take action against people who want to shut down channels and videos that challenge
434300	439300	their beliefs. I have no objection to the legitimate protection of copyright, but this
439300	444300	is an issue of fair use for the purpose of academic debate. In several cases, especially
444300	449300	those related to creationist preacher Kent Hovind, Hovind himself specifically says that
449300	455300	his videos are not copyrighted. But when some YouTubers used clips of his material in order
455300	460300	to refute Hovind, they were shut down because of false claims of breach of copyright.
460800	464800	Let's get this straight. This kind of action has nothing to do with the protection of copyrighted
464800	469800	material. It's a tactic designed purely and simply to shut up dissent, to silence
469800	474800	critics and stamp on freedom of speech. If this is allowed to continue, then YouTube
474800	479800	will eventually become just a boring mouthpiece of organizations that screen comments and
479800	484800	shut down critics. This is your medium, people. Stand up for it.
491300	496300	Hi, this is Vito Omega and I'm stating my support for the campaign against the abuse
496300	503300	of the DMCA. Censorship is basically when you silence people who are critical of your
503300	508800	opinions. The only time when censorship works is when you are infallible. Do you know anyone
508800	514800	who's infallible? Fight DMCA abuse. Fight censorship. This is your YouTube. Stand up for it.
514800	524800	This is Don Exodus. Censorship is a tool used by simple minds to mislead and misinform.
524800	528800	If the facts and reason aren't on your side, it's very easy to win a debate if there's
528800	532800	nobody to debate against. Please, oppose censorship in all its forms, whether it's
532800	537800	a false filing of DMCA copyright claims or simply deleting or disapproving of comments
537800	539800	that disagree with your videos.
544800	561800	CDK007 here. As many of you know, my channel is about the free exchange of ideas. I don't
561800	566800	censor voting, comments, or video responses. However, there are those who are more than
566800	572800	willing to suppress the speech of others in order to further their agenda. Since its inception,
572800	577800	a small minority of people have attempted to manipulate YouTube to censor ideas they
577800	582800	don't necessarily agree with. They have used a variety of techniques, but the false
582800	588800	filing of DMCA's is the most insidious. We don't need to sit back and let these
588800	592800	individuals steal our freedom. If we join together, we can convince YouTube to change
592800	597800	its policies. How do I know this can work? After people realized they could suppress
597800	602800	others by repeatedly down-thumbing every single comment under a video, we complained
602800	607800	and YouTube responded. This time I'm asking you to do more than just think about it.
607800	612800	Together, we can make a difference.
612800	616800	We would like to hear from you if you have been served with a DMCA notice that you consider
616800	621800	was issued in order to prohibit free expression rather than to protect copyright. We would
621800	625800	like to know how often it is happening, who served these notices, what happened as a result.
625800	630800	We believe that opportunity for education, freedom of expression and freedom of speech
630800	634800	are causes worth protecting. We want to do what we can to protect them. Please help us
634800	639800	do that. Feature, favorite, share, rate and comment on the copies of this video on all
639800	641800	our channels. Thank you.
