0	6000	In the first part of this two-part video, I went through Monckton's responses to my catalogue of his errors,
6000	9000	and I'd like to just see how the mistake count now stands.
9000	14000	First, the easy ones. Here, Monckton does a U-turn and either denies he said something,
14000	19000	or completely changes his mind, mostly to the point of agreeing with my rebuttal.
19000	25000	So we're not looking at a sort of long-term systematic loss of ice in the Arctic.
30000	36000	And look at how little correlation there is in that graph between temperature in blue there,
36000	39000	and CO2 concentration in black.
47000	51000	And the glaciers are showing no particular change in 200 years.
51000	54000	The only glacier that's declined a little is Gangotri.
54000	58000	The only glacier that's declined a little is Gangotri.
59000	62000	The only glacier that's declined a little is Gangotri.
69000	73000	At the moment the polar ice caps of Mars are melting,
73000	77000	there has been warming noticed on the surface of Jupiter,
77000	83000	on one of the moons of Neptune, even on far distant Pluto, all at the same time.
83000	87000	And why is this? Because astronauts are taking their 4x4s up into space?
87000	93000	No, it's because the sun, as we'll see, has been remarkably active.
101000	105000	Of course, don't expect Monckton to admit he made a mistake.
105000	108000	What he does in these U-turns is add some new claim,
108000	112000	in the hopes that a debate over the new claim will bury his mistake.
112000	117000	So his admission that there is a correlation between CO2 and global temperatures
117000	120000	is accompanied by a new and unsupported claim
120000	123000	that the data shows it was the temperature rise that came first.
123000	127000	If ever Mr Monckton gets around to providing a source for this claim,
127000	133000	citing studies where the repeated analysis of this data covering the Phanerozoic was published,
133000	135000	then I'll be happy to check it.
135000	141000	But first you have to reconcile your claim that there's no correlation between CO2 and temperatures
141000	143000	with your new claim that there is.
143000	145000	Which one is correct?
145000	150000	Or are you now prepared to accept that you were wrong and that my rebuttal was therefore right?
150000	155000	You can't continue to argue two completely contradictory beliefs.
155000	159000	Similarly, the admission that there's been a 30-year decline in Arctic ice
159000	164000	is buried within a claim about the state of the ice in the 1920s and 40s.
164000	168000	I'm quite prepared to tackle this one with the help of Ola Johansson,
168000	174000	a very diligent Danish researcher who compiled this graph covering exactly the period Monckton cites.
174000	179000	By the way, if Monckton wants to suggest that maybe Johansson is not a diligent researcher
179000	184000	and faked this data as part of a worldwide conspiracy, let me bring in a character witness.
184000	187000	You know who it's going to be, don't you?
187000	188000	You're right.
188000	191000	Johansson et al, very diligent Danish researcher.
191000	193000	But again, before we go on to this claim,
193000	198000	Monckton first needs to fess up and tell us whether he's sticking to what he told his audiences,
198000	202000	which is that we're not looking at a sort of long-term decline of ice in the Arctic,
202000	207000	or whether Arctic ice has certainly declined over the last three decades,
207000	210000	which is what he told us in What's Up With That.
210000	215000	In an apology to Monckton, who'd asked that such criticism should be blocked,
215000	220000	the moderator for What's Up With That claimed my rebuttals lack any form of documentation.
220000	225000	I don't know just what sort of documentation What's Up With That would like to see.
225000	229000	How about a paper that Monckton cites claiming it says one thing,
229000	234000	with big red lines underneath the relevant passage showing it says the complete opposite?
234000	239000	How about court transcripts and newspaper articles showing actual quotes
239000	242000	and comparing them to Monckton's rendering of the quotes?
242000	247000	How about a video showing Monckton actually saying something that he denies saying?
247000	251000	How about this long list of documents, including title, author and date,
251000	256000	along with the time on the video where the document is cited in rebuttal to Monckton?
256000	259000	But no, sycophancy wins over science.
259000	265000	I'm a personal admirer of yours and regret any distress such comments may occasion.
265000	271000	Yes, don't upset the Viscount by informing him that these documents say something very different to what he's telling us.
271000	275000	They say, far better to pretend they simply don't exist.
275000	282000	I never claim Monckton said or wrote something without having a video of him or a document written by him stating it,
282000	287000	and I never refute anything without backing it up with documentary evidence,
287000	291000	even showing you exactly where to find the evidence in the document.
291000	298000	I don't think I could do much more without tying the editors of What's Up With That to a chair and forcing them to look at it.
298000	303000	Everything is meticulously researched and then checked to ensure it's accurate,
303000	309000	and I always correct any errors that are found, either with an annotation or in an errata video.
309000	317000	I have a completely open forum for every video on my channel where people can criticise me or the videos to their heart's content.
317000	324000	These policies are ones that What's Up With That might like to follow instead of apologising to Monckton for a critique
324000	328000	and making the absurd claim that there's no documentation to back it up.
328000	335000	It's no excuse to say this comment about a lack of documentation was directed towards the other Brian, the poster,
335000	341000	because he clearly stated that he was summarising my rebuttals on the forum and he gave my YouTube name.
341000	344000	Someone even posted URLs linked to my videos.
344000	350000	So my rebuttals could easily have been checked as well as the documentation supporting them.
350000	357000	Even the editor, Anthony Watt, seems completely disinterested in checking any documents that might contradict Monckton.
357000	364000	The best choice in dealing with such individuals is to take their claims head on, he tells Monckton, which you've done.
364000	367000	Oh come on, he hasn't taken these claims head on?
367000	375000	He's either ignored the documentary evidence, as you have, or denied he said something or simply changed his claim to conform to the rebuttal.
375000	382000	But of course, Monckton is a revered figure among critics of climate science and a frequent commentator on What's Up With That,
382000	393000	whereas I'm just running this little pony and trap show on YouTube meticulously documenting evidence that Mr Monckton and his friends at What's Up With That feel quite happy to ignore.
