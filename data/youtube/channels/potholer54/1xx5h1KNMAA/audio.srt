00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,000
In the first part of this two-part video, I went through Monckton's responses to my catalogue of his errors,

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:09,000
and I'd like to just see how the mistake count now stands.

3
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:14,000
First, the easy ones. Here, Monckton does a U-turn and either denies he said something,

4
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:19,000
or completely changes his mind, mostly to the point of agreeing with my rebuttal.

5
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:25,000
So we're not looking at a sort of long-term systematic loss of ice in the Arctic.

6
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:36,000
And look at how little correlation there is in that graph between temperature in blue there,

7
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:39,000
and CO2 concentration in black.

8
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:51,000
And the glaciers are showing no particular change in 200 years.

9
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:54,000
The only glacier that's declined a little is Gangotri.

10
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:58,000
The only glacier that's declined a little is Gangotri.

11
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:02,000
The only glacier that's declined a little is Gangotri.

12
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:13,000
At the moment the polar ice caps of Mars are melting,

13
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:17,000
there has been warming noticed on the surface of Jupiter,

14
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:23,000
on one of the moons of Neptune, even on far distant Pluto, all at the same time.

15
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:27,000
And why is this? Because astronauts are taking their 4x4s up into space?

16
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:33,000
No, it's because the sun, as we'll see, has been remarkably active.

17
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:45,000
Of course, don't expect Monckton to admit he made a mistake.

18
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:48,000
What he does in these U-turns is add some new claim,

19
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:52,000
in the hopes that a debate over the new claim will bury his mistake.

20
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:57,000
So his admission that there is a correlation between CO2 and global temperatures

21
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:00,000
is accompanied by a new and unsupported claim

22
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:03,000
that the data shows it was the temperature rise that came first.

23
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:07,000
If ever Mr Monckton gets around to providing a source for this claim,

24
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:13,000
citing studies where the repeated analysis of this data covering the Phanerozoic was published,

25
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:15,000
then I'll be happy to check it.

26
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:21,000
But first you have to reconcile your claim that there's no correlation between CO2 and temperatures

27
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:23,000
with your new claim that there is.

28
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:25,000
Which one is correct?

29
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:30,000
Or are you now prepared to accept that you were wrong and that my rebuttal was therefore right?

30
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:35,000
You can't continue to argue two completely contradictory beliefs.

31
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:39,000
Similarly, the admission that there's been a 30-year decline in Arctic ice

32
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:44,000
is buried within a claim about the state of the ice in the 1920s and 40s.

33
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:48,000
I'm quite prepared to tackle this one with the help of Ola Johansson,

34
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:54,000
a very diligent Danish researcher who compiled this graph covering exactly the period Monckton cites.

35
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:59,000
By the way, if Monckton wants to suggest that maybe Johansson is not a diligent researcher

36
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:04,000
and faked this data as part of a worldwide conspiracy, let me bring in a character witness.

37
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:07,000
You know who it's going to be, don't you?

38
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:08,000
You're right.

39
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:11,000
Johansson et al, very diligent Danish researcher.

40
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:13,000
But again, before we go on to this claim,

41
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:18,000
Monckton first needs to fess up and tell us whether he's sticking to what he told his audiences,

42
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:22,000
which is that we're not looking at a sort of long-term decline of ice in the Arctic,

43
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:27,000
or whether Arctic ice has certainly declined over the last three decades,

44
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:30,000
which is what he told us in What's Up With That.

45
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:35,000
In an apology to Monckton, who'd asked that such criticism should be blocked,

46
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:40,000
the moderator for What's Up With That claimed my rebuttals lack any form of documentation.

47
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:45,000
I don't know just what sort of documentation What's Up With That would like to see.

48
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:49,000
How about a paper that Monckton cites claiming it says one thing,

49
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:54,000
with big red lines underneath the relevant passage showing it says the complete opposite?

50
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:59,000
How about court transcripts and newspaper articles showing actual quotes

51
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:02,000
and comparing them to Monckton's rendering of the quotes?

52
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:07,000
How about a video showing Monckton actually saying something that he denies saying?

53
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:11,000
How about this long list of documents, including title, author and date,

54
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:16,000
along with the time on the video where the document is cited in rebuttal to Monckton?

55
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:19,000
But no, sycophancy wins over science.

56
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:25,000
I'm a personal admirer of yours and regret any distress such comments may occasion.

57
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:31,000
Yes, don't upset the Viscount by informing him that these documents say something very different to what he's telling us.

58
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:35,000
They say, far better to pretend they simply don't exist.

59
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:42,000
I never claim Monckton said or wrote something without having a video of him or a document written by him stating it,

60
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:47,000
and I never refute anything without backing it up with documentary evidence,

61
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:51,000
even showing you exactly where to find the evidence in the document.

62
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:58,000
I don't think I could do much more without tying the editors of What's Up With That to a chair and forcing them to look at it.

63
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:03,000
Everything is meticulously researched and then checked to ensure it's accurate,

64
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:09,000
and I always correct any errors that are found, either with an annotation or in an errata video.

65
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:17,000
I have a completely open forum for every video on my channel where people can criticise me or the videos to their heart's content.

66
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:24,000
These policies are ones that What's Up With That might like to follow instead of apologising to Monckton for a critique

67
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:28,000
and making the absurd claim that there's no documentation to back it up.

68
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:35,000
It's no excuse to say this comment about a lack of documentation was directed towards the other Brian, the poster,

69
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:41,000
because he clearly stated that he was summarising my rebuttals on the forum and he gave my YouTube name.

70
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:44,000
Someone even posted URLs linked to my videos.

71
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:50,000
So my rebuttals could easily have been checked as well as the documentation supporting them.

72
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:57,000
Even the editor, Anthony Watt, seems completely disinterested in checking any documents that might contradict Monckton.

73
00:05:57,000 --> 00:06:04,000
The best choice in dealing with such individuals is to take their claims head on, he tells Monckton, which you've done.

74
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:07,000
Oh come on, he hasn't taken these claims head on?

75
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:15,000
He's either ignored the documentary evidence, as you have, or denied he said something or simply changed his claim to conform to the rebuttal.

76
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:22,000
But of course, Monckton is a revered figure among critics of climate science and a frequent commentator on What's Up With That,

77
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:33,000
whereas I'm just running this little pony and trap show on YouTube meticulously documenting evidence that Mr Monckton and his friends at What's Up With That feel quite happy to ignore.
