0	6000	And with this process there is a considerable release of energy and we've demonstrated that this could be sustained on its own.
6000	10000	In other words, much more energy is coming out than we're putting in.
10000	19000	In 1989, two researchers called Pons and Fleischmann held a press conference announcing to the world that they'd created cold fusion in a test tube.
19000	25000	It was one of those too good to be true moments that was, yeah, too good to be true.
25000	29000	I often used to go to press conferences like this where a new discovery was announced
29000	34000	and while most reporters duly scribbled it down and asked excited questions,
34000	39000	the first thing the science journalists wanted to know was where has this been published?
39000	44000	Now why is that important? In this video we're going to find out.
44000	52000	And along the way you'll learn how to publish your very own scientific paper, even if you've never touched a test tube since elementary school.
52000	57000	You'll find out how to tell the difference between real scientific journals and phony ones.
57000	63000	So a quick quiz question here. Which of these two journals is real and is cited by researchers?
63000	66000	And which one will publish any old bullshit for money?
66000	72000	The International Journal of Advanced Computer Technology or the Journal of Computer and System Sciences?
72000	76000	And we'll find out why this is not a good idea.
77000	82000	Before I look at science at its best, let's first look at junk science at its worst,
82000	88000	because a lot of people are confused about the reliability of scientific journals and they're right to be sceptical.
88000	92000	With the rise of the internet, the number of scientific journals has ballooned
92000	97000	and we've seen a steep rise in the number of fraudulent papers retracted.
97000	103000	Example. In 2013, Okurafu Kobanji of the Wassey Institute of Medicine
103000	107000	submitted a paper to the Journal of Natural Pharmaceuticals.
107000	111000	The paper described the anti-cancer properties of a chemical found in lichen
111000	114000	and was duly peer reviewed and published.
114000	118000	Only problem was, Okurafu Kobanji was a made-up name,
118000	121000	the Wassey Institute of Medicine didn't exist,
121000	127000	the anti-cancer chemical didn't exist, and the paper was complete nonsense.
127000	130000	The real author, John Bohannon of Science magazine,
130000	134000	deliberately wrote a bogus paper that he says a high school chemistry student
134000	138000	should have been able to spot in order to test the robustness of peer review
138000	141000	in these new online journals.
141000	145000	He submitted different versions of the bogus paper to 304 journals
145000	150000	and like the Journal of Natural Pharmaceuticals, more than half accepted it.
150000	157000	Why? Because a lot of these online journals will publish anything as long as you pay.
157000	162000	To start one, all it takes is a keyboard, a telephone line and a bank account.
162000	165000	The most predatory of these newly formed so-called journals
165000	170000	sends out thousands of emails to researchers inviting them to submit papers
170000	174000	and then charges them a couple of hundred dollars for publication.
174000	178000	Now when I say these journals will publish anything, I mean anything!
178000	182000	And you're thinking, yeah we know, nonsense science, you've proved your point.
182000	185000	No! I mean anything!
185000	189000	One researcher was so fed up getting spam emails from predatory journals
189000	192000	that he wrote back begging them to take him off their mailing list.
192000	197000	When that didn't work, he relented and decided to submit a paper titled
197000	200000	Get me off your f***ing mailing list!
200000	211000	Complete with an abstract, an introduction, points of methodology, diagrams and charts,
211000	214000	and a summary.
214000	218000	And you probably think the punchline of this story is that the paper was accepted.
218000	224000	Well, yes it was, by the International Journal of Advanced Computer Technology.
224000	230000	With minor changes, the editor told him, and you have to wonder what the minor changes were.
230000	235000	Did Bohannon make a scientific error somewhere in the text by writing please?
235000	239000	Yes, this is the same International Journal of Advanced Computer Technology
239000	241000	I showed you at the beginning of the video.
241000	246000	It's hard to tell on the face of it that it's any worse than the Journal of Computer and System Sciences.
246000	249000	But the latter is at the other end of the scale.
249000	254000	It's a traditional journal that was in print long before the internet came along.
254000	258000	It's properly peer reviewed and highly cited by other researchers.
258000	262000	Traditional journals like this have been the mainstay of scientific publishing
262000	267000	since the Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society was published 350 years ago,
267000	270000	and is still going strong today.
270000	276000	Unlike pay-to-play journals, these traditional journals don't charge researchers to publish their work.
276000	282000	Instead, they make their money from subscriptions, from libraries, institutes and researchers
282000	286000	who need access to the best and latest scientific information.
286000	288000	That's a crucial difference.
288000	294000	It means they're dependent for their survival on the quality and accuracy of what they publish.
294000	299000	Predatory online journals survive by publishing as many papers as they can,
299000	305000	regardless of accuracy, because they make their money from quantity, not quality.
305000	311000	Outside of this body of knowledge are discussion papers and posters presented at conferences and seminars.
311000	316000	Again, this is traditional publishing, but while these papers may look impressive,
316000	318000	they aren't always peer reviewed.
319000	324000	This one, presented at the Lunar and Planetary Science Conference, and looking very respectable,
324000	328000	comes from a physicist who was arguing that an ancient Martian civilisation
328000	331000	was wiped out by a planetary-wide nuclear explosion.
335000	338000	When I write a peer reviewed paper in a scientific journal...
338000	344000	Same goes for opinion pieces and articles written in magazines affiliated with scientific institutions.
344000	349000	When Christopher Monckton tried to pass off his opinion piece in the Forum of Physics and Society
349000	356000	as a peer reviewed paper, the editors added an annotation stating that it most certainly was not.
356000	363000	These conference papers and opinion pieces aren't peer reviewed because they're just a free flow of ideas.
363000	369000	So why aren't researchers equally free to publish whatever they like in peer reviewed journals?
369000	373000	It's a question Ben Stein posed in his movie Expels.
374000	381000	I have always assumed that scientists were free to ask any question, to pursue any line of inquiry, without fear of reprisal.
381000	384000	Well, yes, of course they are, as we've seen.
384000	390000	They can ask whatever they like, and say whatever they like, even if it's speculation or complete crap.
390000	396000	But that doesn't mean scientific journals have to publish all this speculation and claptrap.
396000	402000	In fact, they have a very clear responsibility to not publish speculation and claptrap.
402000	407000	Because, as I've said before, they are the repository of our current scientific knowledge.
407000	415000	If one bad paper gets into the system, one piece of crap, one miscalculation, or a wild speculation touted as fact,
415000	424000	it could get cited by another paper, and that paper could get cited by another, and our repository of scientific knowledge becomes tainted.
424000	432000	Since all life can be found in the Seinfeld Chronicles, it's a bit like the B.O. on the smelly valet that gets transferred into Jerry's car.
432000	433000	What, do you smell something?
433000	437000	And the smell transfers to everyone it comes into contact with.
437000	444000	But to Ben Stein, keeping this crap from tainting our body of scientific knowledge is censorship.
444000	450000	It all began when I met evolutionary biologist Richard Sternberg in Washington D.C.
450000	461000	His life was nearly ruined when he strayed from the party line while serving as editor of a scientific journal affiliated with the prestigious Smithsonian Museum of Natural History.
461000	464000	What was Dr. Sternberg's crime?
464000	471000	He dared to publish an article by Dr. Stephen Meyer, one of the leading lights of the Intelligent Design movement.
471000	480000	The paper ignited a firestorm of controversy merely because it suggested Intelligent Design might be able to explain how life began.
493000	498000	This supposed example of censorship got a lot of attention, so let's go through this one by one.
502000	506000	No, it wasn't the questioning of Darwinism that's a problem.
506000	511000	Darwin's ideas have been challenged and refuted in the scientific literature hundreds of times.
511000	515000	His idea that life might have begun in warm muddy ponds has been challenged.
515000	517000	His tree of life has been challenged.
517000	521000	His idea that natural selection is driven by mutations has been challenged.
521000	524000	So that wasn't the reason the editor got in trouble.
525000	529000	The mentioning of Intelligent Design that occurs at the end of the paper...
529000	539000	Now we're getting warmer. Stephen Meyer did indeed mention Intelligent Design at the end of the paper, but it was in the most important part, the conclusion.
539000	546000	And throughout the paper Meyer was making an argument for Intelligent Design, even though he was careful not to call it that.
546000	557000	His argument was that the animal phyla of the Cambrian period 500 million years ago were incredibly complex, and that complex objects require an intelligent agent to make them.
557000	563000	He also argued that these organisms had no antecedents except single-celled organisms.
563000	569000	He wasn't saying that paleontologists hadn't found any antecedents yet, which could possibly be argued.
569000	572000	He was arguing that there were none to find.
572000	574000	That's pure speculation.
574000	579000	Even the papers he cited to support that argument didn't support anything of the kind.
579000	588000	So what got Sternberg into trouble wasn't any questioning of Darwinism or a single mention of Intelligent Design right at the end of the paper.
588000	597000	It was publishing a paper full of factual errors and wild speculation, neither of which should be tainting the peer-reviewed scientific literature.
599000	600000	You stink.
601000	608000	Normally this kind of thing is published in something like Answers Journal, which may call itself a professional peer-reviewed technical journal,
608000	612000	but kind of gives the game away from the perspective of the recent creation and global flood.
613000	617000	No one in the rational world takes creationist papers seriously.
617000	628000	So a junk science paper that manages to get into a real scientific journal can then be cited to influence public debate, government policy, and even legal cases.
628000	634000	For example, creationists used the Mayer paper to try to get creationism taught at Dover High School.
634000	640000	In a landmark legal case they fought to prove that Intelligent Design was legitimate science,
640000	645000	and they cited the fact that it was published in a respected peer-reviewed journal as evidence.
648000	657000	It seems that any religious group, political organisation, or citizen scientist who can't get his pet beliefs published because of a lack of evidence
657000	661000	never accepts that the lack of evidence is a just reason for not publishing.
661000	664000	It's always a scientific conspiracy against them.
664000	668000	There is a kind of conspiracy of silence among certain scientists.
668000	672000	They know, but are not telling you, that the upper tectonic plates of Earth
672000	678000	I presume you think it's a giant global conspiracy to cover up the fact that the Earth is flat. Why would they do that?
678000	681000	There probably are financial motives behind it.
681000	687000	And if a scientific paper isn't up to scratch, it's never the errors or a lack of originality that's to blame.
687000	689000	It has to be censorship.
689000	694000	The National Academy of Sciences came out with a report stating GMOs are safe to eat.
694000	701000	A few years ago I covered a similar case of an editor who got into trouble for allowing crap to be published under his watch.
701000	707000	The journal was a minor one called Climate Research, and the paper was by Willy Soone and Sally Balliunas.
707000	709000	Here's what I said back then.
709000	716000	Their work wasn't original research, it was a review of around 240 previously published studies.
716000	722000	They looked at climate proxy records such as tree rings, lake sediments and ice cores over the last thousand years
722000	728000	and concluded that overall the 20th century doesn't contain the warmest anomaly of the past millennium.
728000	733000	The problem with the paper wasn't that it contained mistakes and the methodology was flawed.
733000	738000	A lot of papers get published and then mistakes and flaws are found afterwards.
738000	743000	The problem was that the mistakes were so obvious and the methodology so clearly flawed,
743000	747000	climatologists say the paper should never have been published in the first place.
747000	754000	Even authors of the papers being cited as source material objected to the way their work was misinterpreted.
754000	758000	One problem may have been that Soone and Balliunas, who are astrophysicists,
758000	764000	were looking at things like tree ring data with little knowledge or expertise in that field.
764000	767000	A number of climatologists later critiqued the study.
767000	773000	They found that Soone and Balliunas had confused tree ring growth due to warmth with tree ring growth due to rainfall.
773000	778000	They had compared historical proxies with average temperatures for the 20th century as a whole
778000	783000	instead of the late 20th century, which is the period of anomalous warming.
783000	788000	They had assumed that local variations in temperature could be interpreted as global variations.
788000	793000	If this had been an undergraduate paper, it would have been returned with an F.
793000	800000	Soone and Balliunas' paper was so bad that half the editorial board of the journal Climate Research resigned
800000	806000	after one of the editors was refused permission to publish an editorial pointing out the mistakes.
806000	812000	It was hard to understand why lead author Willie Soone went outside his discipline of astrophysics
812000	818000	to write a review paper on tree ring dating that drew the opposite conclusion to researchers in that field
818000	821000	and was riddled with obvious errors.
821000	828000	Later it was found that Soone had accepted around $1.2 million from fossil fuel companies and political lobby groups
828000	830000	to write review papers.
830000	835000	Apart from the fact that he's supposed to declare that on submitting a paper, which he didn't do,
835000	837000	there's nothing wrong with that.
837000	842000	Soone can take whatever money he wants and submit whatever papers he likes.
842000	847000	The onus is on the editors of the journals to keep this crap out of the scientific literature,
847000	852000	which is why it was the editor who approved the paper who took the heat, and not Soone.
852000	859000	There's no way to make all scientific studies 100% error-free, I'd say that's pretty obvious.
859000	862000	Even the best researchers sometimes make mistakes.
862000	868000	And each advance, along with better technology, is always improving and refining what we know.
868000	874000	So with hindsight, a lot of papers don't get things 100% right, and editors aren't clairvoyant.
874000	880000	They can't tell whether another paper written five years from now will overturn what they've just published.
880000	886000	But that's different to knowingly letting obvious falsehoods infect our body of knowledge.
886000	888000	Because there are consequences.
888000	893000	Just as the intelligent design paper was cited as legitimate science in a court of law,
893000	896000	the Soone and Balliunas paper was cited in Congress
896000	900000	when US lawmakers were trying to play down the cause of climate change.
900000	901000	This is unbelievable, B.R.
901000	902000	I know.
902000	907000	Other people post on my channel claiming that even if the research is not tainted by errors,
907000	913000	and it does significantly advance the science, it won't get published if it changes the status quo.
913000	917000	Not only doesn't that match reality, it makes no sense.
917000	922000	Why would journals only want to publish papers that conform to what we already know?
922000	928000	Libraries, scientific institutes and researchers are paying exorbitant subscription fees,
928000	931000	sometimes tens of thousands of dollars for a single subscription,
931000	937000	in order to learn about the latest advances in science, and to further their own research.
937000	941000	Why would they bother paying money to read papers that don't do that?
941000	948000	No journal would refuse to publish a paper that represents a big advance in an important area of science,
948000	950000	as long as it's backed by evidence.
950000	955000	And why would libraries, researchers and scientific institutes want to pay a lot of money
955000	960000	to subscribe to a journal that publishes phony papers and fraudulent results?
960000	966000	If respected journals didn't ensure that the papers they publish are groundbreaking as well as accurate,
966000	967000	it would be like...
967000	970000	Well, let me see if I can think of a suitable analogy.
970000	971000	Oh, yes.
976000	980000	Obviously, if scientists were ruled by their beliefs rather than evidence,
980000	983000	and if journals only published papers that echoed those beliefs,
983000	987000	we'd never see any of the advances we've seen in science.
987000	990000	No journal would have published papers on plate tectonics
990000	993000	that contradicted the assumption that the continents were fixed,
993000	996000	or the theory that time varies depending on your velocity,
996000	1000000	contradicting our assumption that time is the same for everyone,
1000000	1004000	or that a tiny amount of carbon dioxide can govern atmospheric temperatures,
1004000	1008000	or that the universe was once the size of a pinhead.
1008000	1010000	From the biggest theories to the smallest discoveries,
1010000	1015000	the whole point of scientific publishing is to advance into the unknown,
1015000	1019000	and if possible, overturn our assumptions.
1019000	1024000	So how can you tell whether a journal is respectable and doing a proper job of peer review,
1024000	1028000	or whether the journal is not worth the paper it's not written on?
1028000	1033000	The first thing to check is if it's listed as a scientific journal on the master journals list,
1033000	1036000	which catalogues reputable journals.
1036000	1040000	Libraries will only stock journals that are on the list.
1040000	1042000	If it's on the master journals list,
1042000	1046000	the first step is to check the journal's impact factor in journal citation reports.
1046000	1052000	That's the average number of times each of its papers is cited by other studies in a particular year.
1052000	1057000	As a guide, I'd expect a reasonable journal to have an impact factor of at least two,
1057000	1061000	and a good one would have an impact factor of at least five.
1061000	1064000	But it varies according to the scientific discipline.
1064000	1069000	And be careful, because there are even phony citation reports out there.
1069000	1073000	And unscrupulous researchers can easily bump up their citation score
1073000	1077000	by churning out nonsense and getting it published.
1077000	1082000	In 2013, a French computer analyst discovered that 120 papers
1082000	1087000	published at science conferences in China had been generated by computers,
1087000	1089000	and were scientific gibberish.
1089000	1092000	The papers were later withdrawn.
1092000	1095000	Those two things, whether it's on the master journals list
1095000	1098000	and its impact factor in journal citation reports,
1098000	1102000	should tell you most of what you need to know about a journal.
1102000	1108000	It would have allowed you to differentiate between these two journals very quickly.
1108000	1111000	The same goes for the Journal of Natural Pharmaceuticals
1111000	1117000	and the Annual Review of Pharmacology and Toxicology.
1117000	1121000	And if a study is so game-changing it's been brought to your attention,
1121000	1123000	there usually won't be any grey area.
1123000	1127000	An important paper will be in a traditional journal if it's legitimate,
1127000	1132000	or in a poorly cited open access journal if it isn't.
1132000	1136000	That's not to say all open access journals are bad. Of course they're not.
1136000	1139000	Many are beginning to get a good reputation.
1139000	1142000	But most still don't have a reputation to uphold,
1142000	1146000	which is why nearly all the fraud, errors, gibberish and retractions
1146000	1149000	are found in these new online journals.
1149000	1154000	Medical journals have been especially prone to a rash of bad papers.
1154000	1157000	As for assessing a paper itself, if it's an older paper,
1157000	1159000	then you can look at the number of citations.
1159000	1164000	Respected and important papers will be cited much more by other researchers.
1164000	1168000	But as before, be careful and check the citations.
1168000	1173000	It's now so easy to publish online that an author can easily cite his own paper
1173000	1176000	several times simply to bump up the figures.
1176000	1181000	And sometimes citation isn't an endorsement of the paper, but a criticism.
1181000	1187000	So find out if the paper's been commented on, or corrected, or even retracted.
1187000	1192000	If the paper is very old, has it been superseded by subsequent research?
1192000	1196000	Traditional journals aren't immune to errors, of course.
1196000	1198000	It's just that they get far fewer.
1198000	1202000	And they have other problems like the exorbitant subscription costs
1202000	1207000	and copyright issues that prevent even authors from getting copies of their own papers.
1207000	1211000	Open access may one day become a much better and cheaper way to publish.
1211000	1213000	It's just not there yet.
1213000	1216000	And paying for publication is open to abuse.
1216000	1223000	At the moment, traditional journals are still by far the most reliable way to advance science.
1223000	1228000	And it's a system that stood the test of time for the last three and a half centuries,
1228000	1231000	taking us from this to this.
1231000	1234000	And that brings us back to the claim of Pons and Fleischmann,
1234000	1240000	that got the 1980s media so excited about a new form of limitless, cheap energy.
1240000	1243000	When reporters hear about a new discovery like this,
1243000	1248000	whether they're science reporters or general reporters, they're usually not experts.
1248000	1253000	They can understand what they're hearing, but they've got no way of evaluating it.
1253000	1257000	By knowing it's been published in a respected, peer-reviewed scientific journal,
1257000	1263000	we can be assured that one or two other experts have fact-checked it and that it has some merit.
1263000	1268000	Had peer reviewers done that with the Pons-Fleischmann experiment before the press conference,
1268000	1272000	they might have red-flagged some of the flaws that were subsequently found.
1272000	1277000	But believe it or not, this is how a lot of people think science should be done.
1277000	1283000	Do away with peer review altogether and open the doors to allowing anyone to publish anything.
1283000	1287000	In other words, turn the scientific literature into the blogosphere.
1287000	1292000	If someone wants to publish a paper saying vaccines cause autism, let them.
1292000	1295000	If they want to say the Earth is expanding, what's wrong with that?
1295000	1298000	The highest number of likes gets to be true.
1298000	1303000	Don't you see what's happening here? It's attached itself to me. It's alive!
1303000	1310000	By stifling such novel ideas, they say, the scientific establishment is just being closed-minded.
1310000	1316000	We're living in the world of alternative facts, so schools should be able to use whatever is trending on the internet
1316000	1322000	as teaching material in science class. After all, what's scientific publishing ever done for us?
1322000	1329000	Wait, wait, wait. Since I made this video, there's been another blog posing as a peer-reviewed paper.
1329000	1332000	Of course, copied and pasted by other blogs.
1332000	1336000	It's getting a lot of attention and it really proves the point I've been making.
1336000	1343000	Writing something and posting it on the internet does not make it a peer-reviewed paper published in a respected scientific journal.
1343000	1347000	A claim that it is, is totally bogus.
1347000	1353000	This blog was written and posted by James Wallace III, Joseph Dalio and Craig Idso.
1353000	1362000	The fact that two of them get paid by the Heartland Institute, a political organisation lobbying against climate science, isn't really relevant.
1362000	1366000	Neither is it relevant that they get paid rather well for writing these blogs.
1366000	1372000	According to Heartland's leaked 2012 budget, Joseph Dalio gets $500 a month.
1372000	1380000	Craig Idso gets $11,600 a month. What? Anyway, that's not relevant either.
1380000	1388000	And Idso also writes blogs for the Cato Institute, another political organisation lobbying against climate science.
1388000	1393000	I don't know how much he gets paid by them, but again, it's not relevant.
1393000	1403000	None of this is relevant if they submit whatever research they do for proper peer review and publication in a respected scientific journal.
1403000	1414000	But if they're not willing to submit it to a respected scientific journal for peer review, then it's just a blog paid for by a political organisation to support the conclusion of that organisation.
1414000	1418000	And it's a blog that cites other blogs as sources.
1418000	1431000	As for the claim that the blog has been peer reviewed, getting a bunch of economists, meteorologists and engineers who agree with your conclusion, to state that they agree with your conclusion, is not peer review.
1431000	1441000	In the real world, it's the editor of a respected scientific journal who decides who'll peer review the paper, and he ensures that they're experts in that field.
1441000	1447000	In scientific publishing, it's not the job of peer reviewers to agree or disagree with the conclusions.
1447000	1454000	It's their job to ensure that the methodology, the calculations and the conclusions are robust.
1454000	1463000	After all, the Three Stooges could post a blog claiming that humans lived with dinosaurs, and then get a bunch of geologists, economists and engineers to agree.
1463000	1469000	That doesn't make it a peer reviewed paper published in a respected scientific journal.
1469000	1473000	So, getting back to the validity blog, what's the bombshell?
1473000	1480000	Well, Wallace, Dalio and Idso revealed that NOAA and NASA have adjusted historical temperature data.
1480000	1486000	Yeah, but we already knew that. They've said so publicly.
1486000	1492000	NASA explains this not just on a web page, but in its frequently asked questions.
1492000	1496000	They even wrote papers explaining how and why they made the adjustments.
1496000	1503000	And there have been real peer reviewed papers published in respected scientific journals substantiating the revised temperature record.
1503000	1508000	Updating data is not the exception in science, it's the rule.
1508000	1514000	As scientists gather more and more data, they get a clearer and more accurate picture of past temperatures.
1514000	1520000	So no, a blog citing other blogs isn't going to dismantle a hundred years of solid scientific evidence.
1520000	1526000	We already know that adjustments are made to temperature data, we know how and we know why.
1526000	1536000	If Wallace, Dalio and Idso think there's something wrong with these adjustments, then they have to show it through evidence and publish it as a comment or a response paper.
1536000	1542000	Let other researchers check their facts and point out the flaws. That's how science works.
1542000	1551000	The reason these three authors don't want to do that is because they don't think their analysis would pass peer review and they're probably right.
1551000	1561000	So instead they post it on the internet because 99% of the people who will read it won't have a clue what it's all about, they'll simply believe the conclusion.
1561000	1565000	Then some of them will write blogs themselves with headlines like
1565000	1570000	NASA, NOAA and UK's Met Office falsify temperature data to show warmer temperatures.
1570000	1573000	And those blogs will be copied by other blogs.
1573000	1581000	Eventually I've no doubt this blog will be cited at a congressional hearing and once again be passed off as a peer reviewed scientific paper.
1581000	1593000	If you're not worried about that, then at least be worried about the contamination of a scientific field you do care about, like evolution, cancer, GMOs or vaccinations.
1593000	1601000	And if you don't care about any of these scientific fields being contaminated by crap science, then go live back in the middle ages.
