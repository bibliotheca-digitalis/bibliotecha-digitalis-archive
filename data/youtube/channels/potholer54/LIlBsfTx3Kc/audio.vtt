WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:06.000
And with this process there is a considerable release of energy and we've demonstrated that this could be sustained on its own.

00:06.000 --> 00:10.000
In other words, much more energy is coming out than we're putting in.

00:10.000 --> 00:19.000
In 1989, two researchers called Pons and Fleischmann held a press conference announcing to the world that they'd created cold fusion in a test tube.

00:19.000 --> 00:25.000
It was one of those too good to be true moments that was, yeah, too good to be true.

00:25.000 --> 00:29.000
I often used to go to press conferences like this where a new discovery was announced

00:29.000 --> 00:34.000
and while most reporters duly scribbled it down and asked excited questions,

00:34.000 --> 00:39.000
the first thing the science journalists wanted to know was where has this been published?

00:39.000 --> 00:44.000
Now why is that important? In this video we're going to find out.

00:44.000 --> 00:52.000
And along the way you'll learn how to publish your very own scientific paper, even if you've never touched a test tube since elementary school.

00:52.000 --> 00:57.000
You'll find out how to tell the difference between real scientific journals and phony ones.

00:57.000 --> 01:03.000
So a quick quiz question here. Which of these two journals is real and is cited by researchers?

01:03.000 --> 01:06.000
And which one will publish any old bullshit for money?

01:06.000 --> 01:12.000
The International Journal of Advanced Computer Technology or the Journal of Computer and System Sciences?

01:12.000 --> 01:16.000
And we'll find out why this is not a good idea.

01:17.000 --> 01:22.000
Before I look at science at its best, let's first look at junk science at its worst,

01:22.000 --> 01:28.000
because a lot of people are confused about the reliability of scientific journals and they're right to be sceptical.

01:28.000 --> 01:32.000
With the rise of the internet, the number of scientific journals has ballooned

01:32.000 --> 01:37.000
and we've seen a steep rise in the number of fraudulent papers retracted.

01:37.000 --> 01:43.000
Example. In 2013, Okurafu Kobanji of the Wassey Institute of Medicine

01:43.000 --> 01:47.000
submitted a paper to the Journal of Natural Pharmaceuticals.

01:47.000 --> 01:51.000
The paper described the anti-cancer properties of a chemical found in lichen

01:51.000 --> 01:54.000
and was duly peer reviewed and published.

01:54.000 --> 01:58.000
Only problem was, Okurafu Kobanji was a made-up name,

01:58.000 --> 02:01.000
the Wassey Institute of Medicine didn't exist,

02:01.000 --> 02:07.000
the anti-cancer chemical didn't exist, and the paper was complete nonsense.

02:07.000 --> 02:10.000
The real author, John Bohannon of Science magazine,

02:10.000 --> 02:14.000
deliberately wrote a bogus paper that he says a high school chemistry student

02:14.000 --> 02:18.000
should have been able to spot in order to test the robustness of peer review

02:18.000 --> 02:21.000
in these new online journals.

02:21.000 --> 02:25.000
He submitted different versions of the bogus paper to 304 journals

02:25.000 --> 02:30.000
and like the Journal of Natural Pharmaceuticals, more than half accepted it.

02:30.000 --> 02:37.000
Why? Because a lot of these online journals will publish anything as long as you pay.

02:37.000 --> 02:42.000
To start one, all it takes is a keyboard, a telephone line and a bank account.

02:42.000 --> 02:45.000
The most predatory of these newly formed so-called journals

02:45.000 --> 02:50.000
sends out thousands of emails to researchers inviting them to submit papers

02:50.000 --> 02:54.000
and then charges them a couple of hundred dollars for publication.

02:54.000 --> 02:58.000
Now when I say these journals will publish anything, I mean anything!

02:58.000 --> 03:02.000
And you're thinking, yeah we know, nonsense science, you've proved your point.

03:02.000 --> 03:05.000
No! I mean anything!

03:05.000 --> 03:09.000
One researcher was so fed up getting spam emails from predatory journals

03:09.000 --> 03:12.000
that he wrote back begging them to take him off their mailing list.

03:12.000 --> 03:17.000
When that didn't work, he relented and decided to submit a paper titled

03:17.000 --> 03:20.000
Get me off your f***ing mailing list!

03:20.000 --> 03:31.000
Complete with an abstract, an introduction, points of methodology, diagrams and charts,

03:31.000 --> 03:34.000
and a summary.

03:34.000 --> 03:38.000
And you probably think the punchline of this story is that the paper was accepted.

03:38.000 --> 03:44.000
Well, yes it was, by the International Journal of Advanced Computer Technology.

03:44.000 --> 03:50.000
With minor changes, the editor told him, and you have to wonder what the minor changes were.

03:50.000 --> 03:55.000
Did Bohannon make a scientific error somewhere in the text by writing please?

03:55.000 --> 03:59.000
Yes, this is the same International Journal of Advanced Computer Technology

03:59.000 --> 04:01.000
I showed you at the beginning of the video.

04:01.000 --> 04:06.000
It's hard to tell on the face of it that it's any worse than the Journal of Computer and System Sciences.

04:06.000 --> 04:09.000
But the latter is at the other end of the scale.

04:09.000 --> 04:14.000
It's a traditional journal that was in print long before the internet came along.

04:14.000 --> 04:18.000
It's properly peer reviewed and highly cited by other researchers.

04:18.000 --> 04:22.000
Traditional journals like this have been the mainstay of scientific publishing

04:22.000 --> 04:27.000
since the Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society was published 350 years ago,

04:27.000 --> 04:30.000
and is still going strong today.

04:30.000 --> 04:36.000
Unlike pay-to-play journals, these traditional journals don't charge researchers to publish their work.

04:36.000 --> 04:42.000
Instead, they make their money from subscriptions, from libraries, institutes and researchers

04:42.000 --> 04:46.000
who need access to the best and latest scientific information.

04:46.000 --> 04:48.000
That's a crucial difference.

04:48.000 --> 04:54.000
It means they're dependent for their survival on the quality and accuracy of what they publish.

04:54.000 --> 04:59.000
Predatory online journals survive by publishing as many papers as they can,

04:59.000 --> 05:05.000
regardless of accuracy, because they make their money from quantity, not quality.

05:05.000 --> 05:11.000
Outside of this body of knowledge are discussion papers and posters presented at conferences and seminars.

05:11.000 --> 05:16.000
Again, this is traditional publishing, but while these papers may look impressive,

05:16.000 --> 05:18.000
they aren't always peer reviewed.

05:19.000 --> 05:24.000
This one, presented at the Lunar and Planetary Science Conference, and looking very respectable,

05:24.000 --> 05:28.000
comes from a physicist who was arguing that an ancient Martian civilisation

05:28.000 --> 05:31.000
was wiped out by a planetary-wide nuclear explosion.

05:35.000 --> 05:38.000
When I write a peer reviewed paper in a scientific journal...

05:38.000 --> 05:44.000
Same goes for opinion pieces and articles written in magazines affiliated with scientific institutions.

05:44.000 --> 05:49.000
When Christopher Monckton tried to pass off his opinion piece in the Forum of Physics and Society

05:49.000 --> 05:56.000
as a peer reviewed paper, the editors added an annotation stating that it most certainly was not.

05:56.000 --> 06:03.000
These conference papers and opinion pieces aren't peer reviewed because they're just a free flow of ideas.

06:03.000 --> 06:09.000
So why aren't researchers equally free to publish whatever they like in peer reviewed journals?

06:09.000 --> 06:13.000
It's a question Ben Stein posed in his movie Expels.

06:14.000 --> 06:21.000
I have always assumed that scientists were free to ask any question, to pursue any line of inquiry, without fear of reprisal.

06:21.000 --> 06:24.000
Well, yes, of course they are, as we've seen.

06:24.000 --> 06:30.000
They can ask whatever they like, and say whatever they like, even if it's speculation or complete crap.

06:30.000 --> 06:36.000
But that doesn't mean scientific journals have to publish all this speculation and claptrap.

06:36.000 --> 06:42.000
In fact, they have a very clear responsibility to not publish speculation and claptrap.

06:42.000 --> 06:47.000
Because, as I've said before, they are the repository of our current scientific knowledge.

06:47.000 --> 06:55.000
If one bad paper gets into the system, one piece of crap, one miscalculation, or a wild speculation touted as fact,

06:55.000 --> 07:04.000
it could get cited by another paper, and that paper could get cited by another, and our repository of scientific knowledge becomes tainted.

07:04.000 --> 07:12.000
Since all life can be found in the Seinfeld Chronicles, it's a bit like the B.O. on the smelly valet that gets transferred into Jerry's car.

07:12.000 --> 07:13.000
What, do you smell something?

07:13.000 --> 07:17.000
And the smell transfers to everyone it comes into contact with.

07:17.000 --> 07:24.000
But to Ben Stein, keeping this crap from tainting our body of scientific knowledge is censorship.

07:24.000 --> 07:30.000
It all began when I met evolutionary biologist Richard Sternberg in Washington D.C.

07:30.000 --> 07:41.000
His life was nearly ruined when he strayed from the party line while serving as editor of a scientific journal affiliated with the prestigious Smithsonian Museum of Natural History.

07:41.000 --> 07:44.000
What was Dr. Sternberg's crime?

07:44.000 --> 07:51.000
He dared to publish an article by Dr. Stephen Meyer, one of the leading lights of the Intelligent Design movement.

07:51.000 --> 08:00.000
The paper ignited a firestorm of controversy merely because it suggested Intelligent Design might be able to explain how life began.

08:13.000 --> 08:18.000
This supposed example of censorship got a lot of attention, so let's go through this one by one.

08:22.000 --> 08:26.000
No, it wasn't the questioning of Darwinism that's a problem.

08:26.000 --> 08:31.000
Darwin's ideas have been challenged and refuted in the scientific literature hundreds of times.

08:31.000 --> 08:35.000
His idea that life might have begun in warm muddy ponds has been challenged.

08:35.000 --> 08:37.000
His tree of life has been challenged.

08:37.000 --> 08:41.000
His idea that natural selection is driven by mutations has been challenged.

08:41.000 --> 08:44.000
So that wasn't the reason the editor got in trouble.

08:45.000 --> 08:49.000
The mentioning of Intelligent Design that occurs at the end of the paper...

08:49.000 --> 08:59.000
Now we're getting warmer. Stephen Meyer did indeed mention Intelligent Design at the end of the paper, but it was in the most important part, the conclusion.

08:59.000 --> 09:06.000
And throughout the paper Meyer was making an argument for Intelligent Design, even though he was careful not to call it that.

09:06.000 --> 09:17.000
His argument was that the animal phyla of the Cambrian period 500 million years ago were incredibly complex, and that complex objects require an intelligent agent to make them.

09:17.000 --> 09:23.000
He also argued that these organisms had no antecedents except single-celled organisms.

09:23.000 --> 09:29.000
He wasn't saying that paleontologists hadn't found any antecedents yet, which could possibly be argued.

09:29.000 --> 09:32.000
He was arguing that there were none to find.

09:32.000 --> 09:34.000
That's pure speculation.

09:34.000 --> 09:39.000
Even the papers he cited to support that argument didn't support anything of the kind.

09:39.000 --> 09:48.000
So what got Sternberg into trouble wasn't any questioning of Darwinism or a single mention of Intelligent Design right at the end of the paper.

09:48.000 --> 09:57.000
It was publishing a paper full of factual errors and wild speculation, neither of which should be tainting the peer-reviewed scientific literature.

09:59.000 --> 10:00.000
You stink.

10:01.000 --> 10:08.000
Normally this kind of thing is published in something like Answers Journal, which may call itself a professional peer-reviewed technical journal,

10:08.000 --> 10:12.000
but kind of gives the game away from the perspective of the recent creation and global flood.

10:13.000 --> 10:17.000
No one in the rational world takes creationist papers seriously.

10:17.000 --> 10:28.000
So a junk science paper that manages to get into a real scientific journal can then be cited to influence public debate, government policy, and even legal cases.

10:28.000 --> 10:34.000
For example, creationists used the Mayer paper to try to get creationism taught at Dover High School.

10:34.000 --> 10:40.000
In a landmark legal case they fought to prove that Intelligent Design was legitimate science,

10:40.000 --> 10:45.000
and they cited the fact that it was published in a respected peer-reviewed journal as evidence.

10:48.000 --> 10:57.000
It seems that any religious group, political organisation, or citizen scientist who can't get his pet beliefs published because of a lack of evidence

10:57.000 --> 11:01.000
never accepts that the lack of evidence is a just reason for not publishing.

11:01.000 --> 11:04.000
It's always a scientific conspiracy against them.

11:04.000 --> 11:08.000
There is a kind of conspiracy of silence among certain scientists.

11:08.000 --> 11:12.000
They know, but are not telling you, that the upper tectonic plates of Earth

11:12.000 --> 11:18.000
I presume you think it's a giant global conspiracy to cover up the fact that the Earth is flat. Why would they do that?

11:18.000 --> 11:21.000
There probably are financial motives behind it.

11:21.000 --> 11:27.000
And if a scientific paper isn't up to scratch, it's never the errors or a lack of originality that's to blame.

11:27.000 --> 11:29.000
It has to be censorship.

11:29.000 --> 11:34.000
The National Academy of Sciences came out with a report stating GMOs are safe to eat.

11:34.000 --> 11:41.000
A few years ago I covered a similar case of an editor who got into trouble for allowing crap to be published under his watch.

11:41.000 --> 11:47.000
The journal was a minor one called Climate Research, and the paper was by Willy Soone and Sally Balliunas.

11:47.000 --> 11:49.000
Here's what I said back then.

11:49.000 --> 11:56.000
Their work wasn't original research, it was a review of around 240 previously published studies.

11:56.000 --> 12:02.000
They looked at climate proxy records such as tree rings, lake sediments and ice cores over the last thousand years

12:02.000 --> 12:08.000
and concluded that overall the 20th century doesn't contain the warmest anomaly of the past millennium.

12:08.000 --> 12:13.000
The problem with the paper wasn't that it contained mistakes and the methodology was flawed.

12:13.000 --> 12:18.000
A lot of papers get published and then mistakes and flaws are found afterwards.

12:18.000 --> 12:23.000
The problem was that the mistakes were so obvious and the methodology so clearly flawed,

12:23.000 --> 12:27.000
climatologists say the paper should never have been published in the first place.

12:27.000 --> 12:34.000
Even authors of the papers being cited as source material objected to the way their work was misinterpreted.

12:34.000 --> 12:38.000
One problem may have been that Soone and Balliunas, who are astrophysicists,

12:38.000 --> 12:44.000
were looking at things like tree ring data with little knowledge or expertise in that field.

12:44.000 --> 12:47.000
A number of climatologists later critiqued the study.

12:47.000 --> 12:53.000
They found that Soone and Balliunas had confused tree ring growth due to warmth with tree ring growth due to rainfall.

12:53.000 --> 12:58.000
They had compared historical proxies with average temperatures for the 20th century as a whole

12:58.000 --> 13:03.000
instead of the late 20th century, which is the period of anomalous warming.

13:03.000 --> 13:08.000
They had assumed that local variations in temperature could be interpreted as global variations.

13:08.000 --> 13:13.000
If this had been an undergraduate paper, it would have been returned with an F.

13:13.000 --> 13:20.000
Soone and Balliunas' paper was so bad that half the editorial board of the journal Climate Research resigned

13:20.000 --> 13:26.000
after one of the editors was refused permission to publish an editorial pointing out the mistakes.

13:26.000 --> 13:32.000
It was hard to understand why lead author Willie Soone went outside his discipline of astrophysics

13:32.000 --> 13:38.000
to write a review paper on tree ring dating that drew the opposite conclusion to researchers in that field

13:38.000 --> 13:41.000
and was riddled with obvious errors.

13:41.000 --> 13:48.000
Later it was found that Soone had accepted around $1.2 million from fossil fuel companies and political lobby groups

13:48.000 --> 13:50.000
to write review papers.

13:50.000 --> 13:55.000
Apart from the fact that he's supposed to declare that on submitting a paper, which he didn't do,

13:55.000 --> 13:57.000
there's nothing wrong with that.

13:57.000 --> 14:02.000
Soone can take whatever money he wants and submit whatever papers he likes.

14:02.000 --> 14:07.000
The onus is on the editors of the journals to keep this crap out of the scientific literature,

14:07.000 --> 14:12.000
which is why it was the editor who approved the paper who took the heat, and not Soone.

14:12.000 --> 14:19.000
There's no way to make all scientific studies 100% error-free, I'd say that's pretty obvious.

14:19.000 --> 14:22.000
Even the best researchers sometimes make mistakes.

14:22.000 --> 14:28.000
And each advance, along with better technology, is always improving and refining what we know.

14:28.000 --> 14:34.000
So with hindsight, a lot of papers don't get things 100% right, and editors aren't clairvoyant.

14:34.000 --> 14:40.000
They can't tell whether another paper written five years from now will overturn what they've just published.

14:40.000 --> 14:46.000
But that's different to knowingly letting obvious falsehoods infect our body of knowledge.

14:46.000 --> 14:48.000
Because there are consequences.

14:48.000 --> 14:53.000
Just as the intelligent design paper was cited as legitimate science in a court of law,

14:53.000 --> 14:56.000
the Soone and Balliunas paper was cited in Congress

14:56.000 --> 15:00.000
when US lawmakers were trying to play down the cause of climate change.

15:00.000 --> 15:01.000
This is unbelievable, B.R.

15:01.000 --> 15:02.000
I know.

15:02.000 --> 15:07.000
Other people post on my channel claiming that even if the research is not tainted by errors,

15:07.000 --> 15:13.000
and it does significantly advance the science, it won't get published if it changes the status quo.

15:13.000 --> 15:17.000
Not only doesn't that match reality, it makes no sense.

15:17.000 --> 15:22.000
Why would journals only want to publish papers that conform to what we already know?

15:22.000 --> 15:28.000
Libraries, scientific institutes and researchers are paying exorbitant subscription fees,

15:28.000 --> 15:31.000
sometimes tens of thousands of dollars for a single subscription,

15:31.000 --> 15:37.000
in order to learn about the latest advances in science, and to further their own research.

15:37.000 --> 15:41.000
Why would they bother paying money to read papers that don't do that?

15:41.000 --> 15:48.000
No journal would refuse to publish a paper that represents a big advance in an important area of science,

15:48.000 --> 15:50.000
as long as it's backed by evidence.

15:50.000 --> 15:55.000
And why would libraries, researchers and scientific institutes want to pay a lot of money

15:55.000 --> 16:00.000
to subscribe to a journal that publishes phony papers and fraudulent results?

16:00.000 --> 16:06.000
If respected journals didn't ensure that the papers they publish are groundbreaking as well as accurate,

16:06.000 --> 16:07.000
it would be like...

16:07.000 --> 16:10.000
Well, let me see if I can think of a suitable analogy.

16:10.000 --> 16:11.000
Oh, yes.

16:16.000 --> 16:20.000
Obviously, if scientists were ruled by their beliefs rather than evidence,

16:20.000 --> 16:23.000
and if journals only published papers that echoed those beliefs,

16:23.000 --> 16:27.000
we'd never see any of the advances we've seen in science.

16:27.000 --> 16:30.000
No journal would have published papers on plate tectonics

16:30.000 --> 16:33.000
that contradicted the assumption that the continents were fixed,

16:33.000 --> 16:36.000
or the theory that time varies depending on your velocity,

16:36.000 --> 16:40.000
contradicting our assumption that time is the same for everyone,

16:40.000 --> 16:44.000
or that a tiny amount of carbon dioxide can govern atmospheric temperatures,

16:44.000 --> 16:48.000
or that the universe was once the size of a pinhead.

16:48.000 --> 16:50.000
From the biggest theories to the smallest discoveries,

16:50.000 --> 16:55.000
the whole point of scientific publishing is to advance into the unknown,

16:55.000 --> 16:59.000
and if possible, overturn our assumptions.

16:59.000 --> 17:04.000
So how can you tell whether a journal is respectable and doing a proper job of peer review,

17:04.000 --> 17:08.000
or whether the journal is not worth the paper it's not written on?

17:08.000 --> 17:13.000
The first thing to check is if it's listed as a scientific journal on the master journals list,

17:13.000 --> 17:16.000
which catalogues reputable journals.

17:16.000 --> 17:20.000
Libraries will only stock journals that are on the list.

17:20.000 --> 17:22.000
If it's on the master journals list,

17:22.000 --> 17:26.000
the first step is to check the journal's impact factor in journal citation reports.

17:26.000 --> 17:32.000
That's the average number of times each of its papers is cited by other studies in a particular year.

17:32.000 --> 17:37.000
As a guide, I'd expect a reasonable journal to have an impact factor of at least two,

17:37.000 --> 17:41.000
and a good one would have an impact factor of at least five.

17:41.000 --> 17:44.000
But it varies according to the scientific discipline.

17:44.000 --> 17:49.000
And be careful, because there are even phony citation reports out there.

17:49.000 --> 17:53.000
And unscrupulous researchers can easily bump up their citation score

17:53.000 --> 17:57.000
by churning out nonsense and getting it published.

17:57.000 --> 18:02.000
In 2013, a French computer analyst discovered that 120 papers

18:02.000 --> 18:07.000
published at science conferences in China had been generated by computers,

18:07.000 --> 18:09.000
and were scientific gibberish.

18:09.000 --> 18:12.000
The papers were later withdrawn.

18:12.000 --> 18:15.000
Those two things, whether it's on the master journals list

18:15.000 --> 18:18.000
and its impact factor in journal citation reports,

18:18.000 --> 18:22.000
should tell you most of what you need to know about a journal.

18:22.000 --> 18:28.000
It would have allowed you to differentiate between these two journals very quickly.

18:28.000 --> 18:31.000
The same goes for the Journal of Natural Pharmaceuticals

18:31.000 --> 18:37.000
and the Annual Review of Pharmacology and Toxicology.

18:37.000 --> 18:41.000
And if a study is so game-changing it's been brought to your attention,

18:41.000 --> 18:43.000
there usually won't be any grey area.

18:43.000 --> 18:47.000
An important paper will be in a traditional journal if it's legitimate,

18:47.000 --> 18:52.000
or in a poorly cited open access journal if it isn't.

18:52.000 --> 18:56.000
That's not to say all open access journals are bad. Of course they're not.

18:56.000 --> 18:59.000
Many are beginning to get a good reputation.

18:59.000 --> 19:02.000
But most still don't have a reputation to uphold,

19:02.000 --> 19:06.000
which is why nearly all the fraud, errors, gibberish and retractions

19:06.000 --> 19:09.000
are found in these new online journals.

19:09.000 --> 19:14.000
Medical journals have been especially prone to a rash of bad papers.

19:14.000 --> 19:17.000
As for assessing a paper itself, if it's an older paper,

19:17.000 --> 19:19.000
then you can look at the number of citations.

19:19.000 --> 19:24.000
Respected and important papers will be cited much more by other researchers.

19:24.000 --> 19:28.000
But as before, be careful and check the citations.

19:28.000 --> 19:33.000
It's now so easy to publish online that an author can easily cite his own paper

19:33.000 --> 19:36.000
several times simply to bump up the figures.

19:36.000 --> 19:41.000
And sometimes citation isn't an endorsement of the paper, but a criticism.

19:41.000 --> 19:47.000
So find out if the paper's been commented on, or corrected, or even retracted.

19:47.000 --> 19:52.000
If the paper is very old, has it been superseded by subsequent research?

19:52.000 --> 19:56.000
Traditional journals aren't immune to errors, of course.

19:56.000 --> 19:58.000
It's just that they get far fewer.

19:58.000 --> 20:02.000
And they have other problems like the exorbitant subscription costs

20:02.000 --> 20:07.000
and copyright issues that prevent even authors from getting copies of their own papers.

20:07.000 --> 20:11.000
Open access may one day become a much better and cheaper way to publish.

20:11.000 --> 20:13.000
It's just not there yet.

20:13.000 --> 20:16.000
And paying for publication is open to abuse.

20:16.000 --> 20:23.000
At the moment, traditional journals are still by far the most reliable way to advance science.

20:23.000 --> 20:28.000
And it's a system that stood the test of time for the last three and a half centuries,

20:28.000 --> 20:31.000
taking us from this to this.

20:31.000 --> 20:34.000
And that brings us back to the claim of Pons and Fleischmann,

20:34.000 --> 20:40.000
that got the 1980s media so excited about a new form of limitless, cheap energy.

20:40.000 --> 20:43.000
When reporters hear about a new discovery like this,

20:43.000 --> 20:48.000
whether they're science reporters or general reporters, they're usually not experts.

20:48.000 --> 20:53.000
They can understand what they're hearing, but they've got no way of evaluating it.

20:53.000 --> 20:57.000
By knowing it's been published in a respected, peer-reviewed scientific journal,

20:57.000 --> 21:03.000
we can be assured that one or two other experts have fact-checked it and that it has some merit.

21:03.000 --> 21:08.000
Had peer reviewers done that with the Pons-Fleischmann experiment before the press conference,

21:08.000 --> 21:12.000
they might have red-flagged some of the flaws that were subsequently found.

21:12.000 --> 21:17.000
But believe it or not, this is how a lot of people think science should be done.

21:17.000 --> 21:23.000
Do away with peer review altogether and open the doors to allowing anyone to publish anything.

21:23.000 --> 21:27.000
In other words, turn the scientific literature into the blogosphere.

21:27.000 --> 21:32.000
If someone wants to publish a paper saying vaccines cause autism, let them.

21:32.000 --> 21:35.000
If they want to say the Earth is expanding, what's wrong with that?

21:35.000 --> 21:38.000
The highest number of likes gets to be true.

21:38.000 --> 21:43.000
Don't you see what's happening here? It's attached itself to me. It's alive!

21:43.000 --> 21:50.000
By stifling such novel ideas, they say, the scientific establishment is just being closed-minded.

21:50.000 --> 21:56.000
We're living in the world of alternative facts, so schools should be able to use whatever is trending on the internet

21:56.000 --> 22:02.000
as teaching material in science class. After all, what's scientific publishing ever done for us?

22:02.000 --> 22:09.000
Wait, wait, wait. Since I made this video, there's been another blog posing as a peer-reviewed paper.

22:09.000 --> 22:12.000
Of course, copied and pasted by other blogs.

22:12.000 --> 22:16.000
It's getting a lot of attention and it really proves the point I've been making.

22:16.000 --> 22:23.000
Writing something and posting it on the internet does not make it a peer-reviewed paper published in a respected scientific journal.

22:23.000 --> 22:27.000
A claim that it is, is totally bogus.

22:27.000 --> 22:33.000
This blog was written and posted by James Wallace III, Joseph Dalio and Craig Idso.

22:33.000 --> 22:42.000
The fact that two of them get paid by the Heartland Institute, a political organisation lobbying against climate science, isn't really relevant.

22:42.000 --> 22:46.000
Neither is it relevant that they get paid rather well for writing these blogs.

22:46.000 --> 22:52.000
According to Heartland's leaked 2012 budget, Joseph Dalio gets $500 a month.

22:52.000 --> 23:00.000
Craig Idso gets $11,600 a month. What? Anyway, that's not relevant either.

23:00.000 --> 23:08.000
And Idso also writes blogs for the Cato Institute, another political organisation lobbying against climate science.

23:08.000 --> 23:13.000
I don't know how much he gets paid by them, but again, it's not relevant.

23:13.000 --> 23:23.000
None of this is relevant if they submit whatever research they do for proper peer review and publication in a respected scientific journal.

23:23.000 --> 23:34.000
But if they're not willing to submit it to a respected scientific journal for peer review, then it's just a blog paid for by a political organisation to support the conclusion of that organisation.

23:34.000 --> 23:38.000
And it's a blog that cites other blogs as sources.

23:38.000 --> 23:51.000
As for the claim that the blog has been peer reviewed, getting a bunch of economists, meteorologists and engineers who agree with your conclusion, to state that they agree with your conclusion, is not peer review.

23:51.000 --> 24:01.000
In the real world, it's the editor of a respected scientific journal who decides who'll peer review the paper, and he ensures that they're experts in that field.

24:01.000 --> 24:07.000
In scientific publishing, it's not the job of peer reviewers to agree or disagree with the conclusions.

24:07.000 --> 24:14.000
It's their job to ensure that the methodology, the calculations and the conclusions are robust.

24:14.000 --> 24:23.000
After all, the Three Stooges could post a blog claiming that humans lived with dinosaurs, and then get a bunch of geologists, economists and engineers to agree.

24:23.000 --> 24:29.000
That doesn't make it a peer reviewed paper published in a respected scientific journal.

24:29.000 --> 24:33.000
So, getting back to the validity blog, what's the bombshell?

24:33.000 --> 24:40.000
Well, Wallace, Dalio and Idso revealed that NOAA and NASA have adjusted historical temperature data.

24:40.000 --> 24:46.000
Yeah, but we already knew that. They've said so publicly.

24:46.000 --> 24:52.000
NASA explains this not just on a web page, but in its frequently asked questions.

24:52.000 --> 24:56.000
They even wrote papers explaining how and why they made the adjustments.

24:56.000 --> 25:03.000
And there have been real peer reviewed papers published in respected scientific journals substantiating the revised temperature record.

25:03.000 --> 25:08.000
Updating data is not the exception in science, it's the rule.

25:08.000 --> 25:14.000
As scientists gather more and more data, they get a clearer and more accurate picture of past temperatures.

25:14.000 --> 25:20.000
So no, a blog citing other blogs isn't going to dismantle a hundred years of solid scientific evidence.

25:20.000 --> 25:26.000
We already know that adjustments are made to temperature data, we know how and we know why.

25:26.000 --> 25:36.000
If Wallace, Dalio and Idso think there's something wrong with these adjustments, then they have to show it through evidence and publish it as a comment or a response paper.

25:36.000 --> 25:42.000
Let other researchers check their facts and point out the flaws. That's how science works.

25:42.000 --> 25:51.000
The reason these three authors don't want to do that is because they don't think their analysis would pass peer review and they're probably right.

25:51.000 --> 26:01.000
So instead they post it on the internet because 99% of the people who will read it won't have a clue what it's all about, they'll simply believe the conclusion.

26:01.000 --> 26:05.000
Then some of them will write blogs themselves with headlines like

26:05.000 --> 26:10.000
NASA, NOAA and UK's Met Office falsify temperature data to show warmer temperatures.

26:10.000 --> 26:13.000
And those blogs will be copied by other blogs.

26:13.000 --> 26:21.000
Eventually I've no doubt this blog will be cited at a congressional hearing and once again be passed off as a peer reviewed scientific paper.

26:21.000 --> 26:33.000
If you're not worried about that, then at least be worried about the contamination of a scientific field you do care about, like evolution, cancer, GMOs or vaccinations.

26:33.000 --> 26:41.000
And if you don't care about any of these scientific fields being contaminated by crap science, then go live back in the middle ages.
