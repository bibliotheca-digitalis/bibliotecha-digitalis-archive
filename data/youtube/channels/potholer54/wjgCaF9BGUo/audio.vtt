00:00.000 --> 00:04.000
Is a grand solar minimum coming? Yes.

00:04.000 --> 00:12.000
Well that was easy, because that's what solar physicists have concluded through numerous published studies and years of research.

00:12.000 --> 00:14.500
The question is, what does that mean?

00:14.500 --> 00:20.000
The problem comes when the media hear the words grand and minimum and come to this conclusion.

00:20.000 --> 00:23.500
Far from heating up, the Earth is actually heading for a new ice age.

00:23.500 --> 00:26.000
We're heading into a mini ice age.

00:26.000 --> 00:30.500
So in this video I'm going to answer these basic questions.

00:30.500 --> 00:35.000
What is the grand solar minimum? How grand will it be?

00:35.000 --> 00:38.000
What will be the effect on global temperatures?

00:38.000 --> 00:42.500
And how or why did news reports and blogs get it so wrong?

00:42.500 --> 00:49.500
As always, scientific studies are listed in the video description so you can check them for yourselves.

00:49.500 --> 00:52.500
First, what is the grand solar minimum?

00:52.500 --> 00:56.000
Well, solar irradiance follows three basic patterns.

00:56.000 --> 01:03.500
The longest is a gradual increase in solar luminescence as more of the Sun's hydrogen fuel is fused into helium.

01:03.500 --> 01:09.500
But we don't have to worry about that one, because the effect is only felt over hundreds of millions of years.

01:09.500 --> 01:15.500
The shortest change is an 11 year cycle caused by changes in the Sun's magnetic field.

01:15.500 --> 01:22.000
During the peaks we get flares and sunspots and the Sun gives off a tiny bit more radiation.

01:22.000 --> 01:26.000
The swings look huge, but that's only because of the scale.

01:26.000 --> 01:31.500
In fact, these swings only change solar activity by about 0.1%.

01:31.500 --> 01:37.000
If we represent the variations as a line, the difference between the top and bottom of the line,

01:37.000 --> 01:43.000
in other words the peaks and troughs of the cycle, is only about 1.3 watts per square metre.

01:43.000 --> 01:49.500
Compare that to the Sun's total irradiance of around 1360 watts per square metre

01:49.500 --> 01:52.500
and you can see how tiny these changes are.

01:52.500 --> 01:57.000
So luckily for us, the Sun is a pretty stable star.

01:57.000 --> 02:03.500
Finally, there are the irregular periods of time when several of these peaks are less active in succession.

02:03.500 --> 02:07.500
It's known as a grand minimum not because it's particularly grand

02:07.500 --> 02:11.500
– solar irradiance only falls by less than 0.3%

02:11.500 --> 02:17.000
– but to differentiate it from the ordinary minimum of each 11 year cycle.

02:17.000 --> 02:21.500
These ups and downs of peak solar activity happen at various times

02:21.500 --> 02:25.500
and for varying periods of time with varying intensity.

02:25.500 --> 02:30.000
Patterns have been sought, but none has been definitively found.

02:30.000 --> 02:33.500
Solar activity has been dropping for the last two cycles

02:33.500 --> 02:37.500
and solar physicists can see changes in the Sun's magnetic field

02:37.500 --> 02:42.000
that suggest this marks the start of another grand solar minimum.

02:42.000 --> 02:47.000
So the next thing we need to know is how minimum will the coming GSM be?

02:47.000 --> 02:50.500
The simple answer is, researchers don't know.

02:50.500 --> 02:54.000
So they look at past GSMs as a guide.

02:54.000 --> 02:57.500
The studies that have been done found that total solar irradiance

02:57.500 --> 03:05.500
for the previous four grand solar minima were between 0.08% and 0.25% lower.

03:05.500 --> 03:10.500
The highest figure is for a scenario like the Maunder Minimum of the 17th century.

03:10.500 --> 03:17.000
The term refers to a minimum solar activity named after astronomers Annie and Edward Maunder.

03:17.000 --> 03:22.000
Unfortunately, a lot of people think the Maunder Minimum refers to minimum temperatures

03:22.000 --> 03:26.500
and that's because it occurred in the middle of a cold period called the Little Ice Age.

03:26.500 --> 03:29.500
So they assume it must be the cause.

03:29.500 --> 03:33.000
In fact, the Maunder Minimum can't be the cause for the simple reason

03:33.000 --> 03:38.000
that the Little Ice Age started 200 years before the Maunder Minimum began

03:38.000 --> 03:42.500
and it continued for 100 years after the Maunder Minimum ended.

03:42.500 --> 03:47.500
But what about those frost fairs in London when the Thames froze over?

03:47.500 --> 03:53.000
Well the Thames froze over 23 times between 1408 and 1814.

03:53.000 --> 03:56.500
Only nine of those times occurred during the Maunder Minimum

03:56.500 --> 03:59.500
so that couldn't have been the primary cause.

03:59.500 --> 04:02.500
In fact, the Thames continued to freeze over regularly

04:02.500 --> 04:06.000
even when the Sun was as active as it is today.

04:06.000 --> 04:08.500
The most likely cause, studies have found,

04:08.500 --> 04:13.500
was a series of sulphur-rich volcanic eruptions which reflected sunlight.

04:13.500 --> 04:19.500
But they concluded that when the Maunder Minimum happened between 1650 and 1720

04:19.500 --> 04:22.000
it compounded this cooling.

04:22.000 --> 04:27.000
And a GSM has a strong regional effect which we'll look at in a minute.

04:27.000 --> 04:29.500
That would have exacerbated the cooling further

04:29.500 --> 04:34.000
in places like Western Europe and the northeast part of North America.

04:34.000 --> 04:37.500
So how much of a temperature drop will we see?

04:37.500 --> 04:41.500
Researchers have calculated that even if solar irradiance fell

04:41.500 --> 04:43.500
to the same level of the Maunder Minimum,

04:43.500 --> 04:49.500
the resultant drop in global temperature would be less than 0.3°C.

04:49.500 --> 04:53.500
That's much less than the warming we've seen already this century.

04:53.500 --> 04:56.500
So even if nothing else was acting on global temperature

04:56.500 --> 05:00.500
and even if solar activity dropped to the level of the Maunder Minimum

05:00.500 --> 05:05.000
it would only take us back to the temperature of 2009.

05:05.000 --> 05:08.500
Not a mini ice age or anything like it.

05:08.500 --> 05:13.000
And researchers have calculated that even that small amount of cooling can't happen

05:13.000 --> 05:18.000
because the forcing due to an increase in greenhouse gases over the next few decades

05:18.000 --> 05:23.000
is much greater than the forcing due to a small drop in solar irradiance.

05:23.000 --> 05:25.500
Even if the mathematics is hard to fathom,

05:25.500 --> 05:29.000
the starkest evidence for that is the fact that we've already seen a drop

05:29.000 --> 05:32.000
in solar irradiance over the last two cycles

05:32.000 --> 05:35.500
and global temperatures didn't fall, they rose,

05:35.500 --> 05:41.500
thanks to a 25% increase in CO2 concentration during that period.

05:41.500 --> 05:47.000
And global temperatures are expected to rise another 2°C in the next few decades

05:47.000 --> 05:51.500
as CO2 concentration doubles from pre-industrial revolution levels

05:51.500 --> 05:57.000
far outweighing the 0.25°C expected from the GSM.

05:57.000 --> 05:59.500
But as I mentioned several studies did find

05:59.500 --> 06:03.000
that a reduction in TSI would have a regional effect.

06:03.000 --> 06:05.500
It would reduce ultraviolet radiation

06:05.500 --> 06:09.500
resulting in less ozone being produced in the upper atmosphere.

06:09.500 --> 06:12.500
That will affect things like the North Atlantic Oscillation

06:12.500 --> 06:18.500
and the Arctic Oscillation sending winter storms eastwards from Greenland into Europe.

06:18.500 --> 06:23.000
There will be other regional changes but these still don't mean global cooling,

06:23.000 --> 06:28.000
just variations in weather patterns in some places and at certain times,

06:28.000 --> 06:31.000
and nowhere near enough to bring on a mini ice age

06:31.000 --> 06:34.500
even in those places most severely affected.

06:34.500 --> 06:39.500
Nearly all the scientific studies that have looked into the effects of a GSM

06:39.500 --> 06:44.500
show no possibility of cooling, let alone a little ice age.

06:44.500 --> 06:47.000
So where does this myth come from?

06:47.000 --> 06:51.500
It's so persistent that posters on my channel are convinced it's true.

06:51.500 --> 06:54.500
Well, as always, let's track back to the source

06:54.500 --> 06:59.500
and see where all these blogs and tweets and videos are getting their information from.

06:59.500 --> 07:03.000
A lot of them cited this article by UPI,

07:03.000 --> 07:07.000
a press agency that distributes copied newsrooms around the world.

07:07.000 --> 07:12.000
Earth heading for mini ice age in just 15 years, scientists say.

07:12.000 --> 07:18.000
But the UPI story didn't explain who these scientists were, or even quote them.

07:18.000 --> 07:24.000
Nor did it cite the scientists who supposedly said the GSM will be accompanied by bitter cold winters,

07:24.000 --> 07:29.000
frigid enough to cause rivers like the Thames in London to freeze over.

07:29.000 --> 07:32.500
So where did UPI get its information from?

07:32.500 --> 07:35.500
Well, if you click the link to this claim, shown in blue,

07:35.500 --> 07:38.000
it doesn't take you to any scientists,

07:38.000 --> 07:43.000
it takes you to an article in the Daily Telegraph with the same spurious headline.

07:43.000 --> 07:49.000
And the UPI tells us it also got information from a report in the Independent newspaper,

07:49.000 --> 07:53.000
which ironically is the same newspaper that was claiming a few years ago

07:53.000 --> 07:56.000
that snowfalls are now just a thing of the past.

07:56.000 --> 08:00.000
Now it's claiming there'll be another little ice age.

08:00.000 --> 08:02.000
So that's the next source in our trail.

08:02.000 --> 08:06.000
Where did they get this information about a mini ice age from?

08:06.000 --> 08:10.000
The only source given by both newspapers is a press release

08:10.000 --> 08:15.000
issued by the 2015 National Astronomy meeting in Llandudno.

08:15.000 --> 08:21.000
But the press release didn't say there would be another mini ice age, or anything like it.

08:21.000 --> 08:25.000
It was announcing a presentation by astrophysicist Valentina Zharkova,

08:25.000 --> 08:29.000
predicting only a grand solar minimum.

08:29.000 --> 08:32.000
So how did this innocent and rather obscure research paper,

08:32.000 --> 08:36.000
which confirmed what several other studies had already predicted,

08:36.000 --> 08:38.000
get so badly misunderstood?

08:38.000 --> 08:41.000
Well if we go back and look at the trail, it was here.

08:41.000 --> 08:46.000
The press release issued by the National Astronomy meeting was technically correct,

08:46.000 --> 08:48.000
and reflected the study.

08:48.000 --> 08:53.000
But it did include some colourful detail in order to attract media attention.

08:53.000 --> 08:58.000
Firstly, it said there would be a 60% fall in solar activity.

08:58.000 --> 09:03.000
This is correct, but that doesn't mean a 60% drop in total solar irradiance.

09:03.000 --> 09:08.000
I emailed Professor Zharkova to confirm the obvious, which she did.

09:08.000 --> 09:09.000
She wrote back,

09:09.000 --> 09:17.000
That means the maximal number of sunspots in cycle 26 will be 60-70% lower than in cycle 24.

09:17.000 --> 09:23.000
A 60% drop in total solar irradiance would cause the Earth to freeze over completely,

09:23.000 --> 09:25.000
and extinguish nearly all life.

09:25.000 --> 09:29.000
Solar activity is just this tiny fluctuating range at the top,

09:29.000 --> 09:36.000
which is why researchers have calculated that the actual fall in total solar irradiance would be a fraction of 1%.

09:36.000 --> 09:44.000
And the press release said we can expect conditions last seen during the mini ice age that began in 1645.

09:44.000 --> 09:50.000
The press release was talking about conditions of solar activity, not climate conditions.

09:50.000 --> 09:57.000
Neither Zharkova's study nor the press release made any claim that we'd be seeing another mini ice age,

09:57.000 --> 10:00.000
let alone a timetable of 15 years.

10:00.000 --> 10:09.000
No one is more surprised than Valentina Zharkova that her research prompted a worldwide media storm over the next ice age, said USA Today.

10:09.000 --> 10:11.000
Zharkova told the newspaper,

10:11.000 --> 10:15.000
In the press release we didn't say anything about climate change.

10:15.000 --> 10:17.000
My guess is they heard about the Maunder Minimum.

10:17.000 --> 10:21.000
They used Wikipedia or something to find out more about it.

10:21.000 --> 10:25.000
In fact, the press release linked journalists to a Wikipedia page on the little ice age,

10:25.000 --> 10:28.000
but they obviously didn't read it very carefully.

10:28.000 --> 10:35.000
In fact, the scientific reality was in the independent story, just buried several paragraphs down.

10:35.000 --> 10:42.000
Since the Earth is now warmer, we're unlikely to see a return to the temperatures experienced then, said the independent,

10:42.000 --> 10:45.000
in complete contradiction to its own headline.

10:45.000 --> 10:49.000
And the Telegraph later corrected and redacted its story.

10:49.000 --> 10:56.000
The Telegraph admitted that Zharkova's research did not make any prediction about future climate effects.

10:56.000 --> 11:02.000
But the scary and inaccurate headlines remained, and it was too little too late anyway.

11:02.000 --> 11:08.000
By then the spurious story had been picked up by blogs, where corrections are never made.

11:08.000 --> 11:13.000
This isn't the only trail you can follow to trace back these mini ice age myths.

11:13.000 --> 11:22.000
Here's one that's been passed around the blogosphere, predicting a mini ice age caused by an 8 watts per square metre drop in total solar irradiance.

11:22.000 --> 11:28.000
And here's another one, which as we'll see, eventually leads back to the same source at the end of the trail.

11:28.000 --> 11:33.000
Scientists warn of mini ice age as Sun hibernates during solar minimum.

11:33.000 --> 11:35.000
Its source?

11:35.000 --> 11:41.000
Not scientists, of course. International Business Times cites a story in the Express newspaper.

11:41.000 --> 11:46.000
Earth could be hit by mini ice age as Sun hibernates, expert claims.

11:46.000 --> 11:48.000
And the Express' source?

11:48.000 --> 11:55.000
Apparently this story in the Sun newspaper and its source is a familiar name, Professor Valentina Zharkova,

11:55.000 --> 12:01.000
who told the newspaper the reduction in temperature will result in cold weather on Earth.

12:01.000 --> 12:09.000
Which is a bit strange, because as we've seen, Zharkova herself says she didn't mention the effects of climate in her 2015 study,

12:09.000 --> 12:13.000
and neither has she published any research in this field since then.

12:13.000 --> 12:15.000
Climatology isn't even her field.

12:15.000 --> 12:23.000
When she spoke to USA Today, she expressed surprise that journalists had used her research to make up stories about a coming mini ice age,

12:23.000 --> 12:27.000
and suggested that maybe they got it off Wikipedia.

12:27.000 --> 12:30.000
And yet now, here she is believing those claims.

12:30.000 --> 12:33.000
So where's she getting this from?

12:33.000 --> 12:35.000
We'll start with some actual figures.

12:35.000 --> 12:40.000
Since Zharkova doesn't publish any research on this, it has to come from a video interview.

12:40.000 --> 12:46.000
We look at the calculation of this temperature by Lina Tal, they have a number of papers,

12:46.000 --> 12:58.000
and they show that the temperature on the Earth during the mountain minimum and irradiance was decreased about 0.3%.

12:59.000 --> 13:06.000
By the way, Zharkova isn't referring to someone called Lina Tal, she's referring to papers by Lien et al.

13:06.000 --> 13:14.000
Lien estimates that total solar irradiance during the modern minimum was 0.2% lower, not 0.3%.

13:14.000 --> 13:18.000
That translates to a negative forcing of around 1 watt per square metre,

13:18.000 --> 13:24.000
leading to a lower average global temperature of around 0.1 degrees centigrade.

13:24.000 --> 13:30.000
Lien et al. have shown that this will be overwhelmed by the greenhouse gas forcing we're expecting.

13:30.000 --> 13:37.000
As we've seen, all the other studies that have looked into the cooling effect of a grand solar minimum come to the same conclusion.

13:37.000 --> 13:43.000
It'll have regional effects, but it's not going to make much of a difference to global warming.

13:43.000 --> 13:46.000
So if it doesn't come from Lien et al. or her own research,

13:46.000 --> 13:51.000
where does Zharkova get her information that the GSM will lead to cold weather,

13:51.000 --> 13:54.000
which then becomes a leap into a mini ice age?

13:54.000 --> 13:57.000
After all, she must have got it from somewhere.

13:57.000 --> 14:00.000
To find out, I sent an email and asked her.

14:00.000 --> 14:03.000
Her response was to send me what she called evidence.

14:03.000 --> 14:09.000
Not a scientific paper, as you might expect, but two news reports and a video.

14:09.000 --> 14:12.000
The first news article didn't predict a mini ice age at all.

14:12.000 --> 14:20.000
It was a report on a scientific analysis of a cold spell in the year 536 caused by two major volcanic eruptions.

14:20.000 --> 14:23.000
Nothing to do with solar activity.

14:23.000 --> 14:31.000
The second was a 2019 report on winter floods in Oman and a temperature of minus two degrees at Jabal Shams.

14:31.000 --> 14:33.000
But nothing unusual about that.

14:33.000 --> 14:38.000
I checked the records and it drops below zero at Jabal Shams every winter

14:38.000 --> 14:44.000
because it's the tallest mountain on the Arabian Peninsula, over 9,000 feet high.

14:44.000 --> 14:50.000
And minus two is nowhere near the lowest temperature recorded in 300 years or even 10 years.

14:50.000 --> 14:56.000
Zharkova added that there was snow and frost in other Arab countries in January that year,

14:56.000 --> 14:58.000
but again that's not unusual.

14:58.000 --> 15:03.000
While temperatures were below average that month in a small part of the Middle East,

15:03.000 --> 15:08.000
in the rest of the region it was warmer than average, and pretty much everywhere else in the world.

15:08.000 --> 15:11.000
It's a classic example of cherry picking.

15:11.000 --> 15:17.000
In fact, on a global scale, January 2020 was the warmest on record.

15:17.000 --> 15:25.000
Zharkova's final piece of evidence was a video by a prepper called David Dubine who sells survival merchandise.

15:25.000 --> 15:33.000
Zharkova pointed to two pieces of what she calls evidence in Dubine's videos on variations of sea level and ice.

15:33.000 --> 15:40.000
But these gave false and misleading figures to try to claim that sea levels aren't rising and that arctic ice isn't melting.

15:40.000 --> 15:43.000
I'll take a look at those in a separate video.

15:46.000 --> 15:53.000
They represent trends over the last 140 years, so even if the figures were correct, which they're not,

15:53.000 --> 15:57.000
they can't be evidence that we're entering a mini ice age this year.

15:57.000 --> 16:04.000
Zharkova continued to send me more of what she called evidence, this time by a blogger called Cap Allen,

16:04.000 --> 16:10.000
again detailing cold weather, conspiracy theories and predictions of a mini ice age.

16:10.000 --> 16:13.000
Like Dubine, Cap Allen isn't a climate researcher.

16:13.000 --> 16:18.000
As far as I can tell, he lives in Portugal, he puts his theories on his Facebook page,

16:18.000 --> 16:22.000
and the only thing he's published are a couple of children's books.

16:22.000 --> 16:25.000
So where does Allen get his information from?

16:25.000 --> 16:33.000
Well, a lot of it is just his own speculation that we must be facing a mini ice age because of all these cold weather reports he's reading.

16:33.000 --> 16:38.000
It's a classic case of if it's snowing outside, the world can't be warming.

16:38.000 --> 16:48.000
The only quantitative evidence he presents is a claim that total solar irradiance will drop by about 8 watts per square metre during the grand solar minimum.

16:48.000 --> 16:50.000
And where does he get that from?

16:50.000 --> 16:56.000
It comes from a YouTuber called Lee Wheelbarger, featured on Allen's blog in an interview.

16:56.000 --> 17:01.000
And Wheelbarger claims he got that figure from Zharkova's analysis.

17:01.000 --> 17:04.000
But of course Zharkova never predicted that at all.

17:04.000 --> 17:10.000
She hasn't quantified the radiation drop, except to say that sunspot numbers will decline by 60%.

17:10.000 --> 17:20.000
As we've seen, during an interview Zharkova cites the conclusion of Lee Natal that during the mordor minimum solar irradiance fell by 0.3%.

17:20.000 --> 17:28.000
Actually, Lee Natal said 0.2%, but even if we go with Zharkova's misremembered figure of 0.3%,

17:28.000 --> 17:33.000
and even if we assume that the GSM will be as bad as the mordor minimum,

17:33.000 --> 17:39.000
that still means a drop in total solar irradiance of just 4 watts per square metre, not 8.

17:39.000 --> 17:42.000
We have already done all of the math.

17:42.000 --> 17:50.000
What effect will global warming or the IPCC's numbers have against this?

17:50.000 --> 17:53.000
I've already done all that math.

17:53.000 --> 17:57.000
So the problem seems to be that Wheelbarger worked this out himself.

17:57.000 --> 18:03.000
He then compounds the error by assuming that TSI and solar forcing are the same thing.

18:03.000 --> 18:17.000
So if you do, at worst case scenario, a 1.5 watt per square metre increase in heating based upon the CO2,

18:17.000 --> 18:29.000
so there's what, 6.5 watt minus per square metre loss in TSI to the planet.

18:29.000 --> 18:33.000
If we did get minus 6.5 watts per square metre of forcing,

18:33.000 --> 18:37.000
we'd see ice sheets covering almost all of Europe and North America.

18:37.000 --> 18:40.000
Such a plunge in forcing would be unprecedented.

18:40.000 --> 18:44.000
So we need to look at where Wheelbarger went wrong.

18:44.000 --> 18:52.000
Total solar irradiance is the amount of radiation received by one square metre facing the Sun above the atmosphere.

18:52.000 --> 18:57.000
It's usually a little over 1360 watts per square metre.

18:57.000 --> 19:02.000
But of course that's not the energy received by every square metre on the ground.

19:02.000 --> 19:07.000
We have to divide TSI by 4 to take account of the Earth's spherical shape,

19:07.000 --> 19:11.000
and nearly a third of the radiation is reflected back into space,

19:11.000 --> 19:17.000
so we also need to multiply by 0.7 to take account of the Earth's albedo.

19:17.000 --> 19:28.000
As a result, one watt per square metre change in TSI results in roughly a 0.18 watt per square metre change in solar forcing on Earth.

19:28.000 --> 19:34.000
It can be either positive, forcing temperatures higher, or negative, forcing them lower.

19:34.000 --> 19:38.000
Solar forcing can also be represented by temperature units.

19:38.000 --> 19:46.000
One watt per square metre change in TSI is equivalent to a change in global temperature of around 0.1°C.

19:46.000 --> 19:51.000
By the way, these aren't my figures, I'm an amateur in this field just like Wheelbarger.

19:51.000 --> 19:57.000
The calculations come from studies by Miele, Kopp, Lien and others, cited in the video description.

19:57.000 --> 20:00.000
So let's put Wheelbarger's figures straight.

20:01.000 --> 20:08.000
Firstly, Zhakhova's 0.3% decrease in TSI is about 4 watts per square metre, not 8.

20:08.000 --> 20:18.000
Secondly, a decrease of 4 watts per square metre in TSI works out to a negative forcing of around 0.76 watts per square metre.

20:18.000 --> 20:27.000
So if we subtract that from the positive forcing due to greenhouse gases, we get a positive figure, in other words warming, not cooling.

20:28.000 --> 20:36.000
But of course this claim of an 8 watts per square metre forcing, erroneously attributed to Zhakhova, quickly swamped the blogosphere.

20:36.000 --> 20:39.000
It's hard to shake the faith of people who believe it.

20:40.000 --> 20:49.000
As one solar physicist said, whatever increases the temperature above solar forcing from carbon gases and other factors also has to be addressed.

20:49.000 --> 20:53.000
Zhakhova didn't look at it, she has to leave that to specialists.

20:53.000 --> 20:56.000
Who said that? Zhakhova herself.

20:56.000 --> 21:03.000
And whatever increases above, it increases more than people expect probably coming from carbon or others.

21:03.000 --> 21:10.000
This has to be addressed. This has done, we didn't look at it. So we leave to the specialists who do it.

21:10.000 --> 21:18.000
When The Sun's editors discovered that Zhakhova isn't an expert in this field and was giving personal beliefs that were contrary to scientific conclusions,

21:18.000 --> 21:25.000
they corrected their story, which is unusual for a Murdoch newspaper on the subject of climate change.

21:26.000 --> 21:30.000
And equally unheard of, even the Express corrected its story.

21:30.000 --> 21:36.000
OK, last one, I promise. Here's the latest addition to this alarmism over a mini ice age.

21:37.000 --> 21:45.000
In November 2018, a claim that NASA was predicting global cooling, even a mini ice age, filled the blogosphere.

21:45.000 --> 21:53.000
The wording in many of these stories was identical, which showed that they were all copying off each other rather than reading the source of this information,

21:53.000 --> 21:56.000
even though it was clearly given.

21:56.000 --> 22:01.000
So what did NASA scientist Martin Volunchak tell Space Weather?

22:01.000 --> 22:04.000
Well, all the blogs carried this quote.

22:04.000 --> 22:11.000
We see a cooling trend. High above the Earth's surface, near the edge of space, our atmosphere is losing heat energy.

22:11.000 --> 22:16.000
If current trends continue, it could set a space age record for cold.

22:16.000 --> 22:24.000
So even in the part they quoted, the bloggers and journalists missed the fact that this cooling trend is high above the Earth's surface.

22:24.000 --> 22:33.000
In the next couple of paragraphs, Space Weather explained that this refers to the temperature of the thermosphere, not the temperature here on Earth.

22:33.000 --> 22:38.000
The thermosphere is hundreds of kilometres further up, where many satellites orbit.

22:39.000 --> 22:49.000
So nowhere did Volunchak say the climate would get cooler, or that we're expecting a mini ice age, either in the Space Weather interview or his study on which it was based.

22:49.000 --> 22:57.000
These misrepresentations were inserted by the bloggers and journalists themselves, and then of course spread round the internet.

22:57.000 --> 23:07.000
Fortunately, some bloggers did understand the difference between the troposphere and the thermosphere, and this one checked with Volunchak, who was happy to explain it.

23:08.000 --> 23:12.000
The claims such as those in the Metro article are false, he wrote.

23:12.000 --> 23:19.000
To emphasise, the cooling effects we're seeing in Earth's thermosphere are a result of the current solar minimum conditions.

23:19.000 --> 23:28.000
The thermosphere is the layer of Earth's atmosphere beginning 65 miles above the Earth's surface, and is highly sensitive to solar activity.

23:28.000 --> 23:37.000
There is no relationship between the natural cycle of cooling and warming in the thermosphere, and the weather stroke climate at Earth's surface.

23:37.000 --> 23:41.000
NASA even tried to get that message across by dumbing down the language.

23:41.000 --> 23:47.000
Yes, the Sun is less active ran its headline. No, you're not likely to notice.

23:47.000 --> 23:52.000
Chill out, that's the current message from the Sun to Earth's upper atmosphere.

23:52.000 --> 24:05.000
To be more precise, as the Sun settles into a cyclical, natural lull in activity, the upper atmosphere, or thermosphere, far above our own climate system, is responding in kind by cooling and contracting.

24:05.000 --> 24:11.000
Could that have implications for folks down here on the surface? Absolutely not.

24:11.000 --> 24:15.000
All these mini ice age myths are nothing new.

24:15.000 --> 24:21.000
Predictions that we're about to enter one go back to that infamous Newsweek article that I covered in an earlier video.

24:21.000 --> 24:29.000
But alarmist predictions about imminent cooling continue to be as persistent as claims about the second coming of Jesus.

24:29.000 --> 24:36.000
As soon as one predicted appearance of this mini ice age fails to materialise, another one pops up.

24:36.000 --> 24:39.000
So let's take a trip down memory lane.

24:39.000 --> 24:46.000
In 2001, Don Easterbrook predicted the global chill would start between 2002 and 2012.

24:47.000 --> 24:54.000
But of course it didn't. If we compare Easterbrook's prediction to actual temperatures, he was completely wrong.

24:54.000 --> 25:00.000
But researchers who predicted continued warming were completely right.

25:00.000 --> 25:14.000
In 2005, two Russian solar physicists who predicted that lower solar activity would see global temperatures fall were offered a $10,000 bet by climatologist James Annan, who said temperatures would rise.

25:14.000 --> 25:23.000
The solar physicists lost. Global temperatures did continue rising, just as Annan and other climate researchers had predicted.

25:23.000 --> 25:30.000
In 2007, David Archibald predicted that temperatures would drop by about 2 degrees by 2015.

25:30.000 --> 25:37.000
He was wrong. Temperatures continued rising, just as climate researchers had predicted.

25:37.000 --> 25:44.000
In 2008, Easterbrook tried again, declaring that this time global warming really was over.

25:44.000 --> 25:51.000
And the blog What's Up With That agreed. It said the predicted cooling seems to have already begun.

25:51.000 --> 25:58.000
It hadn't. Temperatures have continued rising since 2008, just as climate researchers have predicted.

25:58.000 --> 26:08.000
The same year, two members of the Global Warming Policy Foundation made a £1,000 bet that 2015 would be colder than 2008. They lost.

26:08.000 --> 26:11.000
In 2009, Jay Lehrer predicted this.

26:11.000 --> 26:24.000
We've seen very, very low sunspot activity and we're definitely, in my mind, not only in a cooling period, we're going to be staying in it for a couple decades.

26:24.000 --> 26:30.000
We weren't. We didn't. Temperatures continued rising, just as climate researchers had predicted.

26:30.000 --> 26:37.000
That same year, Henrik Svensmark declared, global warming has stopped and cooling has begun.

26:37.000 --> 26:42.000
He was wrong. He added that no climate model has predicted cooling of the Earth.

26:42.000 --> 26:52.000
And on that, he was right. The climate models all predicted warming. And as they predicted, the world did continue to warm.

26:52.000 --> 26:59.000
In 2010, Fox News walled up a big chill, complete with a picture of a frozen Statue of Liberty.

26:59.000 --> 27:08.000
They quoted a speech by Don Easterbrook, who once again tried declaring global warming over, and from now there would be global cooling.

27:08.000 --> 27:14.000
But temperatures continued rising, just as climate researchers had predicted.

27:14.000 --> 27:24.000
In 2011, the New Zealand Climate Science Coalition predicted that 2011 would be the coolest year globally since 1956, or even earlier.

27:24.000 --> 27:28.000
It turned out to be the ninth warmest on record.

27:28.000 --> 27:37.000
The same year, there was a prediction by three Norwegians that the drop in solar activity would cause temperatures to plunge in Svalbard between 2009 and 2020.

27:37.000 --> 27:43.000
In fact, temperatures rose, just as climate researchers had predicted.

27:43.000 --> 27:50.000
In 2013, Kabibulo Abdusatimov predicted that the Little Ice Age would begin in 2015.

27:50.000 --> 27:54.000
But, well, you don't need me to tell you what happened.

27:54.000 --> 28:02.000
In 2014, Kevin Long predicted that temperatures would start dropping after 2015, and a deep chill would set in.

28:02.000 --> 28:11.000
It didn't. 2016 was the hottest on record, and the next five years were the hottest five years on record.

28:11.000 --> 28:19.000
And that same year, Ollie Humlum predicted a temperature decrease of up to one degree centigrade by 2020.

28:19.000 --> 28:23.000
Well, we've had a temperature increase of 0.2 degrees.

28:23.000 --> 28:36.000
In 2016, Kabibulo Abdusatimov, undaunted by his earlier failed prediction that the Little Ice Age was supposed to have started in 2015, declared that his Little Ice Age had started anyway.

28:36.000 --> 28:40.000
Now temperatures, he said, would continue to decline.

28:40.000 --> 28:50.000
It hadn't. 2015, 2016, 2017, 2018 and 2019 were not years of a mini ice age, but the hottest years on record.

28:50.000 --> 28:59.000
Despite this trail of failed predictions, the looming mini ice age has always been just around the corner, contrary to scientific studies.

28:59.000 --> 29:11.000
And when the batch of blogosphere hysteria over 2020 being the start of the mini ice age fails to materialise, it'll just shift to next year, and then the year after that.

29:11.000 --> 29:22.000
Meanwhile, scientific predictions that we would not see global cooling but global warming have all consistently borne out, with a surprising degree of accuracy.

29:22.000 --> 29:33.000
When I use the term scientific prediction, I mean predictions that have been published in respected peer-reviewed scientific journals or reports, and in this video that means global temperature predictions.

29:33.000 --> 29:40.000
So please know what about posts in the forum that say, what about this prediction? Or that prediction?

29:40.000 --> 29:48.000
If there was some other failed prediction you want to comment on, please go to the video I've made on that prediction and that subject.

29:49.000 --> 30:03.000
So there are two lessons to be learned from this. Firstly, peer-reviewed science that predicted global warming have been proved right, while bloggers, lobby groups and scientists outside peer-reviewed scientific publishing have been proved wrong.

30:03.000 --> 30:11.000
Secondly, if you want to make easy money, make a bet that we won't see a mini ice age in the next 5, 10 or 20 years.

30:11.000 --> 30:20.000
But make sure you get all the money put into escrow, because Annan says that the Russian solar physicist who lost the bet with him never paid up.
