0	4000	Is a grand solar minimum coming? Yes.
4000	12000	Well that was easy, because that's what solar physicists have concluded through numerous published studies and years of research.
12000	14500	The question is, what does that mean?
14500	20000	The problem comes when the media hear the words grand and minimum and come to this conclusion.
20000	23500	Far from heating up, the Earth is actually heading for a new ice age.
23500	26000	We're heading into a mini ice age.
26000	30500	So in this video I'm going to answer these basic questions.
30500	35000	What is the grand solar minimum? How grand will it be?
35000	38000	What will be the effect on global temperatures?
38000	42500	And how or why did news reports and blogs get it so wrong?
42500	49500	As always, scientific studies are listed in the video description so you can check them for yourselves.
49500	52500	First, what is the grand solar minimum?
52500	56000	Well, solar irradiance follows three basic patterns.
56000	63500	The longest is a gradual increase in solar luminescence as more of the Sun's hydrogen fuel is fused into helium.
63500	69500	But we don't have to worry about that one, because the effect is only felt over hundreds of millions of years.
69500	75500	The shortest change is an 11 year cycle caused by changes in the Sun's magnetic field.
75500	82000	During the peaks we get flares and sunspots and the Sun gives off a tiny bit more radiation.
82000	86000	The swings look huge, but that's only because of the scale.
86000	91500	In fact, these swings only change solar activity by about 0.1%.
91500	97000	If we represent the variations as a line, the difference between the top and bottom of the line,
97000	103000	in other words the peaks and troughs of the cycle, is only about 1.3 watts per square metre.
103000	109500	Compare that to the Sun's total irradiance of around 1360 watts per square metre
109500	112500	and you can see how tiny these changes are.
112500	117000	So luckily for us, the Sun is a pretty stable star.
117000	123500	Finally, there are the irregular periods of time when several of these peaks are less active in succession.
123500	127500	It's known as a grand minimum not because it's particularly grand
127500	131500	– solar irradiance only falls by less than 0.3%
131500	137000	– but to differentiate it from the ordinary minimum of each 11 year cycle.
137000	141500	These ups and downs of peak solar activity happen at various times
141500	145500	and for varying periods of time with varying intensity.
145500	150000	Patterns have been sought, but none has been definitively found.
150000	153500	Solar activity has been dropping for the last two cycles
153500	157500	and solar physicists can see changes in the Sun's magnetic field
157500	162000	that suggest this marks the start of another grand solar minimum.
162000	167000	So the next thing we need to know is how minimum will the coming GSM be?
167000	170500	The simple answer is, researchers don't know.
170500	174000	So they look at past GSMs as a guide.
174000	177500	The studies that have been done found that total solar irradiance
177500	185500	for the previous four grand solar minima were between 0.08% and 0.25% lower.
185500	190500	The highest figure is for a scenario like the Maunder Minimum of the 17th century.
190500	197000	The term refers to a minimum solar activity named after astronomers Annie and Edward Maunder.
197000	202000	Unfortunately, a lot of people think the Maunder Minimum refers to minimum temperatures
202000	206500	and that's because it occurred in the middle of a cold period called the Little Ice Age.
206500	209500	So they assume it must be the cause.
209500	213000	In fact, the Maunder Minimum can't be the cause for the simple reason
213000	218000	that the Little Ice Age started 200 years before the Maunder Minimum began
218000	222500	and it continued for 100 years after the Maunder Minimum ended.
222500	227500	But what about those frost fairs in London when the Thames froze over?
227500	233000	Well the Thames froze over 23 times between 1408 and 1814.
233000	236500	Only nine of those times occurred during the Maunder Minimum
236500	239500	so that couldn't have been the primary cause.
239500	242500	In fact, the Thames continued to freeze over regularly
242500	246000	even when the Sun was as active as it is today.
246000	248500	The most likely cause, studies have found,
248500	253500	was a series of sulphur-rich volcanic eruptions which reflected sunlight.
253500	259500	But they concluded that when the Maunder Minimum happened between 1650 and 1720
259500	262000	it compounded this cooling.
262000	267000	And a GSM has a strong regional effect which we'll look at in a minute.
267000	269500	That would have exacerbated the cooling further
269500	274000	in places like Western Europe and the northeast part of North America.
274000	277500	So how much of a temperature drop will we see?
277500	281500	Researchers have calculated that even if solar irradiance fell
281500	283500	to the same level of the Maunder Minimum,
283500	289500	the resultant drop in global temperature would be less than 0.3°C.
289500	293500	That's much less than the warming we've seen already this century.
293500	296500	So even if nothing else was acting on global temperature
296500	300500	and even if solar activity dropped to the level of the Maunder Minimum
300500	305000	it would only take us back to the temperature of 2009.
305000	308500	Not a mini ice age or anything like it.
308500	313000	And researchers have calculated that even that small amount of cooling can't happen
313000	318000	because the forcing due to an increase in greenhouse gases over the next few decades
318000	323000	is much greater than the forcing due to a small drop in solar irradiance.
323000	325500	Even if the mathematics is hard to fathom,
325500	329000	the starkest evidence for that is the fact that we've already seen a drop
329000	332000	in solar irradiance over the last two cycles
332000	335500	and global temperatures didn't fall, they rose,
335500	341500	thanks to a 25% increase in CO2 concentration during that period.
341500	347000	And global temperatures are expected to rise another 2°C in the next few decades
347000	351500	as CO2 concentration doubles from pre-industrial revolution levels
351500	357000	far outweighing the 0.25°C expected from the GSM.
357000	359500	But as I mentioned several studies did find
359500	363000	that a reduction in TSI would have a regional effect.
363000	365500	It would reduce ultraviolet radiation
365500	369500	resulting in less ozone being produced in the upper atmosphere.
369500	372500	That will affect things like the North Atlantic Oscillation
372500	378500	and the Arctic Oscillation sending winter storms eastwards from Greenland into Europe.
378500	383000	There will be other regional changes but these still don't mean global cooling,
383000	388000	just variations in weather patterns in some places and at certain times,
388000	391000	and nowhere near enough to bring on a mini ice age
391000	394500	even in those places most severely affected.
394500	399500	Nearly all the scientific studies that have looked into the effects of a GSM
399500	404500	show no possibility of cooling, let alone a little ice age.
404500	407000	So where does this myth come from?
407000	411500	It's so persistent that posters on my channel are convinced it's true.
411500	414500	Well, as always, let's track back to the source
414500	419500	and see where all these blogs and tweets and videos are getting their information from.
419500	423000	A lot of them cited this article by UPI,
423000	427000	a press agency that distributes copied newsrooms around the world.
427000	432000	Earth heading for mini ice age in just 15 years, scientists say.
432000	438000	But the UPI story didn't explain who these scientists were, or even quote them.
438000	444000	Nor did it cite the scientists who supposedly said the GSM will be accompanied by bitter cold winters,
444000	449000	frigid enough to cause rivers like the Thames in London to freeze over.
449000	452500	So where did UPI get its information from?
452500	455500	Well, if you click the link to this claim, shown in blue,
455500	458000	it doesn't take you to any scientists,
458000	463000	it takes you to an article in the Daily Telegraph with the same spurious headline.
463000	469000	And the UPI tells us it also got information from a report in the Independent newspaper,
469000	473000	which ironically is the same newspaper that was claiming a few years ago
473000	476000	that snowfalls are now just a thing of the past.
476000	480000	Now it's claiming there'll be another little ice age.
480000	482000	So that's the next source in our trail.
482000	486000	Where did they get this information about a mini ice age from?
486000	490000	The only source given by both newspapers is a press release
490000	495000	issued by the 2015 National Astronomy meeting in Llandudno.
495000	501000	But the press release didn't say there would be another mini ice age, or anything like it.
501000	505000	It was announcing a presentation by astrophysicist Valentina Zharkova,
505000	509000	predicting only a grand solar minimum.
509000	512000	So how did this innocent and rather obscure research paper,
512000	516000	which confirmed what several other studies had already predicted,
516000	518000	get so badly misunderstood?
518000	521000	Well if we go back and look at the trail, it was here.
521000	526000	The press release issued by the National Astronomy meeting was technically correct,
526000	528000	and reflected the study.
528000	533000	But it did include some colourful detail in order to attract media attention.
533000	538000	Firstly, it said there would be a 60% fall in solar activity.
538000	543000	This is correct, but that doesn't mean a 60% drop in total solar irradiance.
543000	548000	I emailed Professor Zharkova to confirm the obvious, which she did.
548000	549000	She wrote back,
549000	557000	That means the maximal number of sunspots in cycle 26 will be 60-70% lower than in cycle 24.
557000	563000	A 60% drop in total solar irradiance would cause the Earth to freeze over completely,
563000	565000	and extinguish nearly all life.
565000	569000	Solar activity is just this tiny fluctuating range at the top,
569000	576000	which is why researchers have calculated that the actual fall in total solar irradiance would be a fraction of 1%.
576000	584000	And the press release said we can expect conditions last seen during the mini ice age that began in 1645.
584000	590000	The press release was talking about conditions of solar activity, not climate conditions.
590000	597000	Neither Zharkova's study nor the press release made any claim that we'd be seeing another mini ice age,
597000	600000	let alone a timetable of 15 years.
600000	609000	No one is more surprised than Valentina Zharkova that her research prompted a worldwide media storm over the next ice age, said USA Today.
609000	611000	Zharkova told the newspaper,
611000	615000	In the press release we didn't say anything about climate change.
615000	617000	My guess is they heard about the Maunder Minimum.
617000	621000	They used Wikipedia or something to find out more about it.
621000	625000	In fact, the press release linked journalists to a Wikipedia page on the little ice age,
625000	628000	but they obviously didn't read it very carefully.
628000	635000	In fact, the scientific reality was in the independent story, just buried several paragraphs down.
635000	642000	Since the Earth is now warmer, we're unlikely to see a return to the temperatures experienced then, said the independent,
642000	645000	in complete contradiction to its own headline.
645000	649000	And the Telegraph later corrected and redacted its story.
649000	656000	The Telegraph admitted that Zharkova's research did not make any prediction about future climate effects.
656000	662000	But the scary and inaccurate headlines remained, and it was too little too late anyway.
662000	668000	By then the spurious story had been picked up by blogs, where corrections are never made.
668000	673000	This isn't the only trail you can follow to trace back these mini ice age myths.
673000	682000	Here's one that's been passed around the blogosphere, predicting a mini ice age caused by an 8 watts per square metre drop in total solar irradiance.
682000	688000	And here's another one, which as we'll see, eventually leads back to the same source at the end of the trail.
688000	693000	Scientists warn of mini ice age as Sun hibernates during solar minimum.
693000	695000	Its source?
695000	701000	Not scientists, of course. International Business Times cites a story in the Express newspaper.
701000	706000	Earth could be hit by mini ice age as Sun hibernates, expert claims.
706000	708000	And the Express' source?
708000	715000	Apparently this story in the Sun newspaper and its source is a familiar name, Professor Valentina Zharkova,
715000	721000	who told the newspaper the reduction in temperature will result in cold weather on Earth.
721000	729000	Which is a bit strange, because as we've seen, Zharkova herself says she didn't mention the effects of climate in her 2015 study,
729000	733000	and neither has she published any research in this field since then.
733000	735000	Climatology isn't even her field.
735000	743000	When she spoke to USA Today, she expressed surprise that journalists had used her research to make up stories about a coming mini ice age,
743000	747000	and suggested that maybe they got it off Wikipedia.
747000	750000	And yet now, here she is believing those claims.
750000	753000	So where's she getting this from?
753000	755000	We'll start with some actual figures.
755000	760000	Since Zharkova doesn't publish any research on this, it has to come from a video interview.
760000	766000	We look at the calculation of this temperature by Lina Tal, they have a number of papers,
766000	778000	and they show that the temperature on the Earth during the mountain minimum and irradiance was decreased about 0.3%.
779000	786000	By the way, Zharkova isn't referring to someone called Lina Tal, she's referring to papers by Lien et al.
786000	794000	Lien estimates that total solar irradiance during the modern minimum was 0.2% lower, not 0.3%.
794000	798000	That translates to a negative forcing of around 1 watt per square metre,
798000	804000	leading to a lower average global temperature of around 0.1 degrees centigrade.
804000	810000	Lien et al. have shown that this will be overwhelmed by the greenhouse gas forcing we're expecting.
810000	817000	As we've seen, all the other studies that have looked into the cooling effect of a grand solar minimum come to the same conclusion.
817000	823000	It'll have regional effects, but it's not going to make much of a difference to global warming.
823000	826000	So if it doesn't come from Lien et al. or her own research,
826000	831000	where does Zharkova get her information that the GSM will lead to cold weather,
831000	834000	which then becomes a leap into a mini ice age?
834000	837000	After all, she must have got it from somewhere.
837000	840000	To find out, I sent an email and asked her.
840000	843000	Her response was to send me what she called evidence.
843000	849000	Not a scientific paper, as you might expect, but two news reports and a video.
849000	852000	The first news article didn't predict a mini ice age at all.
852000	860000	It was a report on a scientific analysis of a cold spell in the year 536 caused by two major volcanic eruptions.
860000	863000	Nothing to do with solar activity.
863000	871000	The second was a 2019 report on winter floods in Oman and a temperature of minus two degrees at Jabal Shams.
871000	873000	But nothing unusual about that.
873000	878000	I checked the records and it drops below zero at Jabal Shams every winter
878000	884000	because it's the tallest mountain on the Arabian Peninsula, over 9,000 feet high.
884000	890000	And minus two is nowhere near the lowest temperature recorded in 300 years or even 10 years.
890000	896000	Zharkova added that there was snow and frost in other Arab countries in January that year,
896000	898000	but again that's not unusual.
898000	903000	While temperatures were below average that month in a small part of the Middle East,
903000	908000	in the rest of the region it was warmer than average, and pretty much everywhere else in the world.
908000	911000	It's a classic example of cherry picking.
911000	917000	In fact, on a global scale, January 2020 was the warmest on record.
917000	925000	Zharkova's final piece of evidence was a video by a prepper called David Dubine who sells survival merchandise.
925000	933000	Zharkova pointed to two pieces of what she calls evidence in Dubine's videos on variations of sea level and ice.
933000	940000	But these gave false and misleading figures to try to claim that sea levels aren't rising and that arctic ice isn't melting.
940000	943000	I'll take a look at those in a separate video.
946000	953000	They represent trends over the last 140 years, so even if the figures were correct, which they're not,
953000	957000	they can't be evidence that we're entering a mini ice age this year.
957000	964000	Zharkova continued to send me more of what she called evidence, this time by a blogger called Cap Allen,
964000	970000	again detailing cold weather, conspiracy theories and predictions of a mini ice age.
970000	973000	Like Dubine, Cap Allen isn't a climate researcher.
973000	978000	As far as I can tell, he lives in Portugal, he puts his theories on his Facebook page,
978000	982000	and the only thing he's published are a couple of children's books.
982000	985000	So where does Allen get his information from?
985000	993000	Well, a lot of it is just his own speculation that we must be facing a mini ice age because of all these cold weather reports he's reading.
993000	998000	It's a classic case of if it's snowing outside, the world can't be warming.
998000	1008000	The only quantitative evidence he presents is a claim that total solar irradiance will drop by about 8 watts per square metre during the grand solar minimum.
1008000	1010000	And where does he get that from?
1010000	1016000	It comes from a YouTuber called Lee Wheelbarger, featured on Allen's blog in an interview.
1016000	1021000	And Wheelbarger claims he got that figure from Zharkova's analysis.
1021000	1024000	But of course Zharkova never predicted that at all.
1024000	1030000	She hasn't quantified the radiation drop, except to say that sunspot numbers will decline by 60%.
1030000	1040000	As we've seen, during an interview Zharkova cites the conclusion of Lee Natal that during the mordor minimum solar irradiance fell by 0.3%.
1040000	1048000	Actually, Lee Natal said 0.2%, but even if we go with Zharkova's misremembered figure of 0.3%,
1048000	1053000	and even if we assume that the GSM will be as bad as the mordor minimum,
1053000	1059000	that still means a drop in total solar irradiance of just 4 watts per square metre, not 8.
1059000	1062000	We have already done all of the math.
1062000	1070000	What effect will global warming or the IPCC's numbers have against this?
1070000	1073000	I've already done all that math.
1073000	1077000	So the problem seems to be that Wheelbarger worked this out himself.
1077000	1083000	He then compounds the error by assuming that TSI and solar forcing are the same thing.
1083000	1097000	So if you do, at worst case scenario, a 1.5 watt per square metre increase in heating based upon the CO2,
1097000	1109000	so there's what, 6.5 watt minus per square metre loss in TSI to the planet.
1109000	1113000	If we did get minus 6.5 watts per square metre of forcing,
1113000	1117000	we'd see ice sheets covering almost all of Europe and North America.
1117000	1120000	Such a plunge in forcing would be unprecedented.
1120000	1124000	So we need to look at where Wheelbarger went wrong.
1124000	1132000	Total solar irradiance is the amount of radiation received by one square metre facing the Sun above the atmosphere.
1132000	1137000	It's usually a little over 1360 watts per square metre.
1137000	1142000	But of course that's not the energy received by every square metre on the ground.
1142000	1147000	We have to divide TSI by 4 to take account of the Earth's spherical shape,
1147000	1151000	and nearly a third of the radiation is reflected back into space,
1151000	1157000	so we also need to multiply by 0.7 to take account of the Earth's albedo.
1157000	1168000	As a result, one watt per square metre change in TSI results in roughly a 0.18 watt per square metre change in solar forcing on Earth.
1168000	1174000	It can be either positive, forcing temperatures higher, or negative, forcing them lower.
1174000	1178000	Solar forcing can also be represented by temperature units.
1178000	1186000	One watt per square metre change in TSI is equivalent to a change in global temperature of around 0.1°C.
1186000	1191000	By the way, these aren't my figures, I'm an amateur in this field just like Wheelbarger.
1191000	1197000	The calculations come from studies by Miele, Kopp, Lien and others, cited in the video description.
1197000	1200000	So let's put Wheelbarger's figures straight.
1201000	1208000	Firstly, Zhakhova's 0.3% decrease in TSI is about 4 watts per square metre, not 8.
1208000	1218000	Secondly, a decrease of 4 watts per square metre in TSI works out to a negative forcing of around 0.76 watts per square metre.
1218000	1227000	So if we subtract that from the positive forcing due to greenhouse gases, we get a positive figure, in other words warming, not cooling.
1228000	1236000	But of course this claim of an 8 watts per square metre forcing, erroneously attributed to Zhakhova, quickly swamped the blogosphere.
1236000	1239000	It's hard to shake the faith of people who believe it.
1240000	1249000	As one solar physicist said, whatever increases the temperature above solar forcing from carbon gases and other factors also has to be addressed.
1249000	1253000	Zhakhova didn't look at it, she has to leave that to specialists.
1253000	1256000	Who said that? Zhakhova herself.
1256000	1263000	And whatever increases above, it increases more than people expect probably coming from carbon or others.
1263000	1270000	This has to be addressed. This has done, we didn't look at it. So we leave to the specialists who do it.
1270000	1278000	When The Sun's editors discovered that Zhakhova isn't an expert in this field and was giving personal beliefs that were contrary to scientific conclusions,
1278000	1285000	they corrected their story, which is unusual for a Murdoch newspaper on the subject of climate change.
1286000	1290000	And equally unheard of, even the Express corrected its story.
1290000	1296000	OK, last one, I promise. Here's the latest addition to this alarmism over a mini ice age.
1297000	1305000	In November 2018, a claim that NASA was predicting global cooling, even a mini ice age, filled the blogosphere.
1305000	1313000	The wording in many of these stories was identical, which showed that they were all copying off each other rather than reading the source of this information,
1313000	1316000	even though it was clearly given.
1316000	1321000	So what did NASA scientist Martin Volunchak tell Space Weather?
1321000	1324000	Well, all the blogs carried this quote.
1324000	1331000	We see a cooling trend. High above the Earth's surface, near the edge of space, our atmosphere is losing heat energy.
1331000	1336000	If current trends continue, it could set a space age record for cold.
1336000	1344000	So even in the part they quoted, the bloggers and journalists missed the fact that this cooling trend is high above the Earth's surface.
1344000	1353000	In the next couple of paragraphs, Space Weather explained that this refers to the temperature of the thermosphere, not the temperature here on Earth.
1353000	1358000	The thermosphere is hundreds of kilometres further up, where many satellites orbit.
1359000	1369000	So nowhere did Volunchak say the climate would get cooler, or that we're expecting a mini ice age, either in the Space Weather interview or his study on which it was based.
1369000	1377000	These misrepresentations were inserted by the bloggers and journalists themselves, and then of course spread round the internet.
1377000	1387000	Fortunately, some bloggers did understand the difference between the troposphere and the thermosphere, and this one checked with Volunchak, who was happy to explain it.
1388000	1392000	The claims such as those in the Metro article are false, he wrote.
1392000	1399000	To emphasise, the cooling effects we're seeing in Earth's thermosphere are a result of the current solar minimum conditions.
1399000	1408000	The thermosphere is the layer of Earth's atmosphere beginning 65 miles above the Earth's surface, and is highly sensitive to solar activity.
1408000	1417000	There is no relationship between the natural cycle of cooling and warming in the thermosphere, and the weather stroke climate at Earth's surface.
1417000	1421000	NASA even tried to get that message across by dumbing down the language.
1421000	1427000	Yes, the Sun is less active ran its headline. No, you're not likely to notice.
1427000	1432000	Chill out, that's the current message from the Sun to Earth's upper atmosphere.
1432000	1445000	To be more precise, as the Sun settles into a cyclical, natural lull in activity, the upper atmosphere, or thermosphere, far above our own climate system, is responding in kind by cooling and contracting.
1445000	1451000	Could that have implications for folks down here on the surface? Absolutely not.
1451000	1455000	All these mini ice age myths are nothing new.
1455000	1461000	Predictions that we're about to enter one go back to that infamous Newsweek article that I covered in an earlier video.
1461000	1469000	But alarmist predictions about imminent cooling continue to be as persistent as claims about the second coming of Jesus.
1469000	1476000	As soon as one predicted appearance of this mini ice age fails to materialise, another one pops up.
1476000	1479000	So let's take a trip down memory lane.
1479000	1486000	In 2001, Don Easterbrook predicted the global chill would start between 2002 and 2012.
1487000	1494000	But of course it didn't. If we compare Easterbrook's prediction to actual temperatures, he was completely wrong.
1494000	1500000	But researchers who predicted continued warming were completely right.
1500000	1514000	In 2005, two Russian solar physicists who predicted that lower solar activity would see global temperatures fall were offered a $10,000 bet by climatologist James Annan, who said temperatures would rise.
1514000	1523000	The solar physicists lost. Global temperatures did continue rising, just as Annan and other climate researchers had predicted.
1523000	1530000	In 2007, David Archibald predicted that temperatures would drop by about 2 degrees by 2015.
1530000	1537000	He was wrong. Temperatures continued rising, just as climate researchers had predicted.
1537000	1544000	In 2008, Easterbrook tried again, declaring that this time global warming really was over.
1544000	1551000	And the blog What's Up With That agreed. It said the predicted cooling seems to have already begun.
1551000	1558000	It hadn't. Temperatures have continued rising since 2008, just as climate researchers have predicted.
1558000	1568000	The same year, two members of the Global Warming Policy Foundation made a £1,000 bet that 2015 would be colder than 2008. They lost.
1568000	1571000	In 2009, Jay Lehrer predicted this.
1571000	1584000	We've seen very, very low sunspot activity and we're definitely, in my mind, not only in a cooling period, we're going to be staying in it for a couple decades.
1584000	1590000	We weren't. We didn't. Temperatures continued rising, just as climate researchers had predicted.
1590000	1597000	That same year, Henrik Svensmark declared, global warming has stopped and cooling has begun.
1597000	1602000	He was wrong. He added that no climate model has predicted cooling of the Earth.
1602000	1612000	And on that, he was right. The climate models all predicted warming. And as they predicted, the world did continue to warm.
1612000	1619000	In 2010, Fox News walled up a big chill, complete with a picture of a frozen Statue of Liberty.
1619000	1628000	They quoted a speech by Don Easterbrook, who once again tried declaring global warming over, and from now there would be global cooling.
1628000	1634000	But temperatures continued rising, just as climate researchers had predicted.
1634000	1644000	In 2011, the New Zealand Climate Science Coalition predicted that 2011 would be the coolest year globally since 1956, or even earlier.
1644000	1648000	It turned out to be the ninth warmest on record.
1648000	1657000	The same year, there was a prediction by three Norwegians that the drop in solar activity would cause temperatures to plunge in Svalbard between 2009 and 2020.
1657000	1663000	In fact, temperatures rose, just as climate researchers had predicted.
1663000	1670000	In 2013, Kabibulo Abdusatimov predicted that the Little Ice Age would begin in 2015.
1670000	1674000	But, well, you don't need me to tell you what happened.
1674000	1682000	In 2014, Kevin Long predicted that temperatures would start dropping after 2015, and a deep chill would set in.
1682000	1691000	It didn't. 2016 was the hottest on record, and the next five years were the hottest five years on record.
1691000	1699000	And that same year, Ollie Humlum predicted a temperature decrease of up to one degree centigrade by 2020.
1699000	1703000	Well, we've had a temperature increase of 0.2 degrees.
1703000	1716000	In 2016, Kabibulo Abdusatimov, undaunted by his earlier failed prediction that the Little Ice Age was supposed to have started in 2015, declared that his Little Ice Age had started anyway.
1716000	1720000	Now temperatures, he said, would continue to decline.
1720000	1730000	It hadn't. 2015, 2016, 2017, 2018 and 2019 were not years of a mini ice age, but the hottest years on record.
1730000	1739000	Despite this trail of failed predictions, the looming mini ice age has always been just around the corner, contrary to scientific studies.
1739000	1751000	And when the batch of blogosphere hysteria over 2020 being the start of the mini ice age fails to materialise, it'll just shift to next year, and then the year after that.
1751000	1762000	Meanwhile, scientific predictions that we would not see global cooling but global warming have all consistently borne out, with a surprising degree of accuracy.
1762000	1773000	When I use the term scientific prediction, I mean predictions that have been published in respected peer-reviewed scientific journals or reports, and in this video that means global temperature predictions.
1773000	1780000	So please know what about posts in the forum that say, what about this prediction? Or that prediction?
1780000	1788000	If there was some other failed prediction you want to comment on, please go to the video I've made on that prediction and that subject.
1789000	1803000	So there are two lessons to be learned from this. Firstly, peer-reviewed science that predicted global warming have been proved right, while bloggers, lobby groups and scientists outside peer-reviewed scientific publishing have been proved wrong.
1803000	1811000	Secondly, if you want to make easy money, make a bet that we won't see a mini ice age in the next 5, 10 or 20 years.
1811000	1820000	But make sure you get all the money put into escrow, because Annan says that the Russian solar physicist who lost the bet with him never paid up.
