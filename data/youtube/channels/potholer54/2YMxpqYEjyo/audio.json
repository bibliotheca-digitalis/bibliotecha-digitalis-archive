{"text": " When I started this channel I decided to maintain anonymity. At the time I was still working regularly and didn't want evangelicals harassing the networks I reported for. But as this channel has become more popular it seems my credentials are beginning to matter and now that I plan to do a series on science and the media and inject some personal opinion they're going to matter even more. So I've decided to come out of my comfortable cocoon of anonymity, strip away the cape, the leotard and the budgie smugglers and reveal my identity. I'm sorry to say it won't be all that exciting after all the speculation that's been going on and here I am at a media briefing circa 1993. But let's go back. I started writing for the British press in South America in the early 1980s but news was scant and British interest in the news from South America was even In 1986 I traveled to Japan and found my forte writing humor. First for Punch and then the Sunday Express and Private Eye. In 1992 Punch folded after a glorious 150 year history but my association with Private Eye continued for another 12 years. In 1988 I was taken on as the Tokyo correspondent for Britain's Sunday Times newspaper. I also began writing freelance stories for New Scientist magazine. In 1989 the Tokyo correspondent for New Scientist left and I took over the role. I continued writing for New Scientist for the next 16 years. In 1991 lured by the promise of a weekly column I quit the Sunday Times and was poached by the Daily Mail. The column left me plenty of time to freelance. I teamed up with a photographer who I still consider to be one of the best in the Far East, Robert MacLeod, and began doing feature stories for Britain's so-called Sunday supplements. The Sunday Times magazine, The Observer magazine, and You magazine. In those days they were the magazines every British writer aspired to. As more assignments came in I found I was traveling more first around Japan and then to other parts of the Far East. How I got into broadcasting is a bit bizarre. I think it was 1992 and I was in the workroom at the Foreign Correspondence Club in Tokyo. A journalist answered the workroom phone and it turned out to be Monitor Radio in Boston on the line wanting someone to do a Q&A. I volunteered to do it and afterwards Monitor Radio asked if I'd be their regular correspondent first in Tokyo then the Far East. If it weren't for the barbed wire and the secret police patrolling in odd-looking punts on the water Aung San Suu Kyi's lakeside home would be the model of serenity. She was held prisoner here for seven years until her release last year. Once people know your work in the media offers start flooding in So after a year with Monitor Radio I was soon getting assignments from other radio networks. By the mid 90s I was flying out of the country about once a month. That's why behind the slopes that lead to this tranquil temple hundreds of laborers are working to build tourist walkways and souvenir shops. Army trucks supply the raw material local people provide the labor. Peter what would be next what would the Japanese do after announcing this tax cut package? The big fight is not going to be economic it's going to be political the prime minister has to actually push this through parliament now to a certain extent he's put his political reputation on the line because we've been through the various processes. What are Kim Jong Nam's relations like with his father? He is I suppose you might say the favored son he is the son of Kim Jong Il's first wife who is a very famous North Korean actress and he's highly placed he was working for the North Korea's national intelligence agency for a year and a half Political analysts say tension in the Japanese diet is now so high that Ibuchi may be forced to dissolve parliament and call a general election Peter Hadfield BBC News Tokyo. Through all of this I was still filing regularly for New Scientist. Over the 16 years I worked for the magazine I filed at least one story a week when I wasn't traveling sometimes it was just a small news piece sometimes a major feature story that took a week to research and write. The science ranged from robotics and mechanical engineering to microbiology and geophysics. My work at New Scientist and my experience in radio soon led me to regular work with science programs like the BBC's Science in Action an Australian broadcasting science show Joining me to discuss these questions and others more intelligently phrased are three top science journalists joining us from Tokyo Peter Hadfield hello Peter yes hello from the Daily Telegraph in London Roger Highfield science editor of that august newspaper hello roger hello there hi sits back as his wife sells part of the catch to other villagers biologist Kent Hortle says the Mekong system is so complex that even one dam can have a major effect. By now I had an arrangement with a broadcasting network and a newspaper in most english-speaking countries except in the United States where I was only working for radio so I began writing for USA Today to fill the gap the move into television also got off to a bizarre start I got a call from the BBC show South Today they knew my name through BBC radio and asked if I had any experience in television. Having absolutely no experience at all I told them yes of course well it's all going off with remarkable precision and that's hardly surprising this isn't so much an exercise as it is a performance for the television cameras inflating even this modest achievement more brazenly than a timball resume I wormed my way into other tv networks. Since I was already cbc's radio correspondent I was taken on as correspondent for cbc television and did a weekly link with a bc-based program called Pacific Rim Report. After working on a documentary with WTN and Fuji television Fuji took me on as a sort of voice of the foreign media in Japan and invaded our home once a month to quiz me about whatever was the story of the day and I became a kind of substitute teacher of the international airwaves filling in for the bureau chiefs of other networks when they were overseas the prime minister will find out just how much stomach the Japanese people have for the kind of harsh medicine he wants them to take. Peter Hadfield CNN Tokyo. A national BBC program called the John Dunn show asked me to do a weekly Q&A in 1994 John brought the whole show to Japan oasis in the heart of Tokyo and joining me here is the man who's been our eyes on Japan for so long and to whom I've spoken so often on the phone Peter Hadfield hello Peter wonderful to see you hello John yes nice to see you in the flesh in the flesh tell me about this imperial when John Dunn retired in 1998 sadly the legendary broadcaster died a few years after that the BBC bundled me off to radio 2's Katrina Liskanich show to do a similar weekly Q&A. My relationship with USA Today ended in about 1998 when US News and World Report offered me a position as their correspondent at about the same time I ended my arrangement with the Daily Mail and became Tokyo correspondent for the Sunday Telegraph. I continued reporting after I moved to Australia in late 2001.
