WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:03.680
When I started this channel I decided to maintain anonymity.

00:03.680 --> 00:07.680
At the time I was still working regularly and didn't want evangelicals

00:07.680 --> 00:12.160
harassing the networks I reported for. But as this channel has become more

00:12.160 --> 00:15.600
popular it seems my credentials are beginning to matter

00:15.600 --> 00:18.800
and now that I plan to do a series on science and the media

00:18.800 --> 00:22.960
and inject some personal opinion they're going to matter even more.

00:22.960 --> 00:26.560
So I've decided to come out of my comfortable cocoon of anonymity,

00:26.560 --> 00:29.760
strip away the cape, the leotard and the budgie smugglers

00:29.760 --> 00:34.640
and reveal my identity. I'm sorry to say it won't be all that exciting

00:34.640 --> 00:38.240
after all the speculation that's been going on and here I am

00:38.240 --> 00:43.840
at a media briefing circa 1993. But let's go back. I started writing for

00:43.840 --> 00:47.200
the British press in South America in the early 1980s

00:47.200 --> 00:51.280
but news was scant and British interest in the news from South America was even

00:52.240 --> 00:56.160
In 1986 I traveled to Japan and found my forte

00:56.160 --> 01:01.680
writing humor. First for Punch and then the Sunday Express and Private Eye.

01:01.680 --> 01:06.560
In 1992 Punch folded after a glorious 150 year history

01:06.560 --> 01:10.640
but my association with Private Eye continued for another 12 years.

01:10.640 --> 01:14.720
In 1988 I was taken on as the Tokyo correspondent for Britain's Sunday

01:14.720 --> 01:18.080
Times newspaper. I also began writing freelance stories

01:18.080 --> 01:22.640
for New Scientist magazine. In 1989 the Tokyo correspondent for New

01:22.640 --> 01:25.920
Scientist left and I took over the role. I continued

01:25.920 --> 01:29.280
writing for New Scientist for the next 16 years.

01:29.280 --> 01:32.720
In 1991 lured by the promise of a weekly column

01:32.720 --> 01:36.240
I quit the Sunday Times and was poached by the Daily Mail.

01:36.240 --> 01:39.680
The column left me plenty of time to freelance. I teamed up with a

01:39.680 --> 01:43.280
photographer who I still consider to be one of the best in the Far East,

01:43.280 --> 01:47.440
Robert MacLeod, and began doing feature stories for Britain's so-called Sunday

01:47.440 --> 01:50.560
supplements. The Sunday Times magazine, The Observer

01:50.560 --> 01:54.480
magazine, and You magazine. In those days they were the magazines

01:54.480 --> 01:58.560
every British writer aspired to. As more assignments came in I found I

01:58.560 --> 02:01.600
was traveling more first around Japan and then to other

02:01.600 --> 02:05.360
parts of the Far East. How I got into broadcasting is a bit

02:05.360 --> 02:09.360
bizarre. I think it was 1992 and I was in the workroom at the Foreign

02:09.360 --> 02:12.880
Correspondence Club in Tokyo. A journalist answered the workroom phone

02:12.880 --> 02:16.000
and it turned out to be Monitor Radio in Boston on the line

02:16.000 --> 02:19.600
wanting someone to do a Q&A. I volunteered to do it

02:19.600 --> 02:23.440
and afterwards Monitor Radio asked if I'd be their regular correspondent

02:23.440 --> 02:27.520
first in Tokyo then the Far East. If it weren't for the barbed wire and the

02:27.520 --> 02:30.960
secret police patrolling in odd-looking punts on the water

02:30.960 --> 02:34.880
Aung San Suu Kyi's lakeside home would be the model of serenity.

02:34.880 --> 02:38.880
She was held prisoner here for seven years until her release last year.

02:38.880 --> 02:42.480
Once people know your work in the media offers start flooding in

02:42.480 --> 02:46.000
So after a year with Monitor Radio I was soon getting assignments from other

02:46.000 --> 02:49.360
radio networks. By the mid 90s I was flying out of the

02:49.360 --> 02:52.960
country about once a month. That's why behind the slopes that lead to

02:52.960 --> 02:56.400
this tranquil temple hundreds of laborers are working to build

02:56.400 --> 03:01.600
tourist walkways and souvenir shops. Army trucks supply the raw material

03:01.600 --> 03:05.920
local people provide the labor. Peter what would be next what would the

03:05.920 --> 03:08.800
Japanese do after announcing this tax cut package?

03:08.800 --> 03:12.080
The big fight is not going to be economic it's going to be political

03:12.080 --> 03:15.360
the prime minister has to actually push this through parliament

03:15.360 --> 03:19.120
now to a certain extent he's put his political reputation on the line

03:19.120 --> 03:23.040
because we've been through the various processes. What are Kim Jong Nam's

03:23.040 --> 03:28.320
relations like with his father? He is I suppose you might say the favored son

03:28.320 --> 03:32.240
he is the son of Kim Jong Il's first wife who is a very famous

03:32.240 --> 03:36.720
North Korean actress and he's highly placed he was working for the North

03:36.720 --> 03:39.680
Korea's national intelligence agency for a year and a half

03:39.680 --> 03:43.760
Political analysts say tension in the Japanese diet is now so high

03:43.760 --> 03:48.000
that Ibuchi may be forced to dissolve parliament and call a general election

03:48.000 --> 03:52.240
Peter Hadfield BBC News Tokyo. Through all of this I was still filing

03:52.240 --> 03:56.080
regularly for New Scientist. Over the 16 years I worked for the

03:56.080 --> 04:00.000
magazine I filed at least one story a week when I wasn't traveling

04:00.000 --> 04:04.160
sometimes it was just a small news piece sometimes a major feature story that

04:04.160 --> 04:08.160
took a week to research and write. The science ranged from robotics and

04:08.240 --> 04:12.560
mechanical engineering to microbiology and geophysics. My work

04:12.560 --> 04:15.280
at New Scientist and my experience in radio

04:15.280 --> 04:19.280
soon led me to regular work with science programs like the BBC's Science in

04:19.280 --> 04:22.400
Action an Australian broadcasting science show

04:22.400 --> 04:25.920
Joining me to discuss these questions and others more intelligently phrased

04:25.920 --> 04:30.000
are three top science journalists joining us from Tokyo Peter Hadfield

04:30.000 --> 04:33.280
hello Peter yes hello from the Daily Telegraph in London

04:33.280 --> 04:35.840
Roger Highfield science editor of that august

04:35.840 --> 04:40.560
newspaper hello roger hello there hi sits back as his wife sells part of

04:40.560 --> 04:44.080
the catch to other villagers

04:47.840 --> 04:52.080
biologist Kent Hortle says the Mekong system is so complex

04:52.080 --> 04:56.000
that even one dam can have a major effect. By now I had an arrangement with

04:56.000 --> 04:59.840
a broadcasting network and a newspaper in most english-speaking countries

04:59.840 --> 05:03.200
except in the United States where I was only working for radio

05:03.200 --> 05:06.720
so I began writing for USA Today to fill the gap

05:06.720 --> 05:10.080
the move into television also got off to a bizarre start

05:10.080 --> 05:13.200
I got a call from the BBC show South Today

05:13.200 --> 05:17.200
they knew my name through BBC radio and asked if I had any experience in

05:17.200 --> 05:21.040
television. Having absolutely no experience at all I

05:21.040 --> 05:24.160
told them yes of course well it's all going off

05:24.160 --> 05:27.040
with remarkable precision and that's hardly surprising

05:27.040 --> 05:31.360
this isn't so much an exercise as it is a performance for the television cameras

05:32.160 --> 05:36.480
inflating even this modest achievement more brazenly than a timball resume

05:36.480 --> 05:41.440
I wormed my way into other tv networks. Since I was already cbc's radio

05:41.440 --> 05:44.000
correspondent I was taken on as correspondent for

05:44.000 --> 05:48.640
cbc television and did a weekly link with a bc-based program called Pacific

05:48.640 --> 05:52.240
Rim Report. After working on a documentary with WTN

05:52.240 --> 05:55.360
and Fuji television Fuji took me on as a sort of voice of

05:55.360 --> 05:58.720
the foreign media in Japan and invaded our home once a month to

05:58.720 --> 06:02.880
quiz me about whatever was the story of the day

06:05.920 --> 06:09.360
and I became a kind of substitute teacher of the international airwaves

06:09.360 --> 06:13.120
filling in for the bureau chiefs of other networks when they were overseas

06:13.120 --> 06:16.480
the prime minister will find out just how much stomach the Japanese people

06:16.480 --> 06:18.880
have for the kind of harsh medicine he wants

06:18.880 --> 06:22.720
them to take. Peter Hadfield CNN Tokyo. A national BBC

06:22.720 --> 06:26.560
program called the John Dunn show asked me to do a weekly Q&A

06:26.560 --> 06:29.520
in 1994 John brought the whole show to Japan

06:29.520 --> 06:33.840
oasis in the heart of Tokyo and joining me here is the man who's been our eyes

06:33.840 --> 06:37.200
on Japan for so long and to whom I've spoken so often on the

06:37.200 --> 06:40.400
phone Peter Hadfield hello Peter wonderful to see you hello John yes nice

06:40.400 --> 06:44.000
to see you in the flesh in the flesh tell me about this imperial when John

06:44.000 --> 06:47.920
Dunn retired in 1998 sadly the legendary broadcaster died a

06:47.920 --> 06:51.280
few years after that the BBC bundled me off to radio 2's

06:51.280 --> 06:55.120
Katrina Liskanich show to do a similar weekly Q&A. My

06:55.120 --> 06:58.640
relationship with USA Today ended in about 1998

06:58.640 --> 07:02.720
when US News and World Report offered me a position as their correspondent

07:02.720 --> 07:05.920
at about the same time I ended my arrangement with the Daily Mail

07:05.920 --> 07:09.840
and became Tokyo correspondent for the Sunday Telegraph. I continued reporting

07:09.840 --> 07:14.640
after I moved to Australia in late 2001. They've been throwing everything they

07:14.640 --> 07:18.720
can at this latest fire which has penetrated deep into suburban

07:18.720 --> 07:22.080
Sydney in one area the flames up to 20 meters

07:22.160 --> 07:26.000
high reached backyard fences before being turned by the wind

07:26.000 --> 07:30.400
after a few minutes ghostly gray shapes are silhouetted against the trees

07:30.400 --> 07:35.040
Glover switches off the engine trains his spotlight on the grazing kangaroos

07:35.040 --> 07:39.360
and lifts his rifle he's sitting down feeding

07:43.360 --> 07:47.200
straight through the head see instant death

07:48.240 --> 07:51.760
some of these rescue children would be lucky enough to return to their home

07:51.760 --> 07:55.360
countries and find work using the skills they acquired here at

07:55.360 --> 07:58.560
Nontoburi others will have to cope with lingering

07:58.560 --> 08:03.600
trauma and as often happens abuse from friends and relatives in the

08:03.600 --> 08:07.280
24 years I've been reporting a lot has changed in the Far East

08:07.280 --> 08:11.040
when I started most countries in the Far East were ruled by dictators

08:11.040 --> 08:14.320
by the time I left they were flourishing democracies

08:14.320 --> 08:18.640
China opened up Japan went from economic superpower to basket case

08:18.640 --> 08:22.800
the last colonial outpost disappeared covering the region has been like

08:22.800 --> 08:25.120
traveling through the pages of a history book

08:25.120 --> 08:29.120
and helping write the text among the thousands of people I interviewed the

08:29.120 --> 08:33.280
ones who impressed me most weren't the Hollywood celebrities or the politicians

08:33.280 --> 08:36.800
the person who made the biggest impression on me was probably Han Dong

08:36.800 --> 08:39.040
Fang who most people would never even have

08:39.040 --> 08:43.520
heard of we spend so much time obsessed with the inconsequential lives of

08:43.520 --> 08:46.560
celebrities that the courage and tenacity of really

08:46.560 --> 08:50.480
extraordinary people go unnoticed but I won't climb onto this

08:50.480 --> 08:53.840
hobby horse just yet this channel will continue to focus on

08:53.840 --> 08:57.360
the accurate reading of science and in the new series I'll look at how the

08:57.360 --> 09:03.200
media report science and why they so often get it wrong
