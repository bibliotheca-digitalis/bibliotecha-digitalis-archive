0	3680	When I started this channel I decided to maintain anonymity.
3680	7680	At the time I was still working regularly and didn't want evangelicals
7680	12160	harassing the networks I reported for. But as this channel has become more
12160	15600	popular it seems my credentials are beginning to matter
15600	18800	and now that I plan to do a series on science and the media
18800	22960	and inject some personal opinion they're going to matter even more.
22960	26560	So I've decided to come out of my comfortable cocoon of anonymity,
26560	29760	strip away the cape, the leotard and the budgie smugglers
29760	34640	and reveal my identity. I'm sorry to say it won't be all that exciting
34640	38240	after all the speculation that's been going on and here I am
38240	43840	at a media briefing circa 1993. But let's go back. I started writing for
43840	47200	the British press in South America in the early 1980s
47200	51280	but news was scant and British interest in the news from South America was even
52240	56160	In 1986 I traveled to Japan and found my forte
56160	61680	writing humor. First for Punch and then the Sunday Express and Private Eye.
61680	66560	In 1992 Punch folded after a glorious 150 year history
66560	70640	but my association with Private Eye continued for another 12 years.
70640	74720	In 1988 I was taken on as the Tokyo correspondent for Britain's Sunday
74720	78080	Times newspaper. I also began writing freelance stories
78080	82640	for New Scientist magazine. In 1989 the Tokyo correspondent for New
82640	85920	Scientist left and I took over the role. I continued
85920	89280	writing for New Scientist for the next 16 years.
89280	92720	In 1991 lured by the promise of a weekly column
92720	96240	I quit the Sunday Times and was poached by the Daily Mail.
96240	99680	The column left me plenty of time to freelance. I teamed up with a
99680	103280	photographer who I still consider to be one of the best in the Far East,
103280	107440	Robert MacLeod, and began doing feature stories for Britain's so-called Sunday
107440	110560	supplements. The Sunday Times magazine, The Observer
110560	114480	magazine, and You magazine. In those days they were the magazines
114480	118560	every British writer aspired to. As more assignments came in I found I
118560	121600	was traveling more first around Japan and then to other
121600	125360	parts of the Far East. How I got into broadcasting is a bit
125360	129360	bizarre. I think it was 1992 and I was in the workroom at the Foreign
129360	132880	Correspondence Club in Tokyo. A journalist answered the workroom phone
132880	136000	and it turned out to be Monitor Radio in Boston on the line
136000	139600	wanting someone to do a Q&A. I volunteered to do it
139600	143440	and afterwards Monitor Radio asked if I'd be their regular correspondent
143440	147520	first in Tokyo then the Far East. If it weren't for the barbed wire and the
147520	150960	secret police patrolling in odd-looking punts on the water
150960	154880	Aung San Suu Kyi's lakeside home would be the model of serenity.
154880	158880	She was held prisoner here for seven years until her release last year.
158880	162480	Once people know your work in the media offers start flooding in
162480	166000	So after a year with Monitor Radio I was soon getting assignments from other
166000	169360	radio networks. By the mid 90s I was flying out of the
169360	172960	country about once a month. That's why behind the slopes that lead to
172960	176400	this tranquil temple hundreds of laborers are working to build
176400	181600	tourist walkways and souvenir shops. Army trucks supply the raw material
181600	185920	local people provide the labor. Peter what would be next what would the
185920	188800	Japanese do after announcing this tax cut package?
188800	192080	The big fight is not going to be economic it's going to be political
192080	195360	the prime minister has to actually push this through parliament
195360	199120	now to a certain extent he's put his political reputation on the line
199120	203040	because we've been through the various processes. What are Kim Jong Nam's
203040	208320	relations like with his father? He is I suppose you might say the favored son
208320	212240	he is the son of Kim Jong Il's first wife who is a very famous
212240	216720	North Korean actress and he's highly placed he was working for the North
216720	219680	Korea's national intelligence agency for a year and a half
219680	223760	Political analysts say tension in the Japanese diet is now so high
223760	228000	that Ibuchi may be forced to dissolve parliament and call a general election
228000	232240	Peter Hadfield BBC News Tokyo. Through all of this I was still filing
232240	236080	regularly for New Scientist. Over the 16 years I worked for the
236080	240000	magazine I filed at least one story a week when I wasn't traveling
240000	244160	sometimes it was just a small news piece sometimes a major feature story that
244160	248160	took a week to research and write. The science ranged from robotics and
248240	252560	mechanical engineering to microbiology and geophysics. My work
252560	255280	at New Scientist and my experience in radio
255280	259280	soon led me to regular work with science programs like the BBC's Science in
259280	262400	Action an Australian broadcasting science show
262400	265920	Joining me to discuss these questions and others more intelligently phrased
265920	270000	are three top science journalists joining us from Tokyo Peter Hadfield
270000	273280	hello Peter yes hello from the Daily Telegraph in London
273280	275840	Roger Highfield science editor of that august
275840	280560	newspaper hello roger hello there hi sits back as his wife sells part of
280560	284080	the catch to other villagers
287840	292080	biologist Kent Hortle says the Mekong system is so complex
292080	296000	that even one dam can have a major effect. By now I had an arrangement with
296000	299840	a broadcasting network and a newspaper in most english-speaking countries
299840	303200	except in the United States where I was only working for radio
303200	306720	so I began writing for USA Today to fill the gap
306720	310080	the move into television also got off to a bizarre start
310080	313200	I got a call from the BBC show South Today
313200	317200	they knew my name through BBC radio and asked if I had any experience in
317200	321040	television. Having absolutely no experience at all I
321040	324160	told them yes of course well it's all going off
324160	327040	with remarkable precision and that's hardly surprising
327040	331360	this isn't so much an exercise as it is a performance for the television cameras
332160	336480	inflating even this modest achievement more brazenly than a timball resume
336480	341440	I wormed my way into other tv networks. Since I was already cbc's radio
341440	344000	correspondent I was taken on as correspondent for
344000	348640	cbc television and did a weekly link with a bc-based program called Pacific
348640	352240	Rim Report. After working on a documentary with WTN
352240	355360	and Fuji television Fuji took me on as a sort of voice of
355360	358720	the foreign media in Japan and invaded our home once a month to
358720	362880	quiz me about whatever was the story of the day
365920	369360	and I became a kind of substitute teacher of the international airwaves
369360	373120	filling in for the bureau chiefs of other networks when they were overseas
373120	376480	the prime minister will find out just how much stomach the Japanese people
376480	378880	have for the kind of harsh medicine he wants
378880	382720	them to take. Peter Hadfield CNN Tokyo. A national BBC
382720	386560	program called the John Dunn show asked me to do a weekly Q&A
386560	389520	in 1994 John brought the whole show to Japan
389520	393840	oasis in the heart of Tokyo and joining me here is the man who's been our eyes
393840	397200	on Japan for so long and to whom I've spoken so often on the
397200	400400	phone Peter Hadfield hello Peter wonderful to see you hello John yes nice
400400	404000	to see you in the flesh in the flesh tell me about this imperial when John
404000	407920	Dunn retired in 1998 sadly the legendary broadcaster died a
407920	411280	few years after that the BBC bundled me off to radio 2's
411280	415120	Katrina Liskanich show to do a similar weekly Q&A. My
415120	418640	relationship with USA Today ended in about 1998
418640	422720	when US News and World Report offered me a position as their correspondent
422720	425920	at about the same time I ended my arrangement with the Daily Mail
425920	429840	and became Tokyo correspondent for the Sunday Telegraph. I continued reporting
429840	434640	after I moved to Australia in late 2001. They've been throwing everything they
434640	438720	can at this latest fire which has penetrated deep into suburban
438720	442080	Sydney in one area the flames up to 20 meters
442160	446000	high reached backyard fences before being turned by the wind
446000	450400	after a few minutes ghostly gray shapes are silhouetted against the trees
450400	455040	Glover switches off the engine trains his spotlight on the grazing kangaroos
455040	459360	and lifts his rifle he's sitting down feeding
463360	467200	straight through the head see instant death
468240	471760	some of these rescue children would be lucky enough to return to their home
471760	475360	countries and find work using the skills they acquired here at
475360	478560	Nontoburi others will have to cope with lingering
478560	483600	trauma and as often happens abuse from friends and relatives in the
483600	487280	24 years I've been reporting a lot has changed in the Far East
487280	491040	when I started most countries in the Far East were ruled by dictators
491040	494320	by the time I left they were flourishing democracies
494320	498640	China opened up Japan went from economic superpower to basket case
498640	502800	the last colonial outpost disappeared covering the region has been like
502800	505120	traveling through the pages of a history book
505120	509120	and helping write the text among the thousands of people I interviewed the
509120	513280	ones who impressed me most weren't the Hollywood celebrities or the politicians
513280	516800	the person who made the biggest impression on me was probably Han Dong
516800	519040	Fang who most people would never even have
519040	523520	heard of we spend so much time obsessed with the inconsequential lives of
523520	526560	celebrities that the courage and tenacity of really
526560	530480	extraordinary people go unnoticed but I won't climb onto this
530480	533840	hobby horse just yet this channel will continue to focus on
533840	537360	the accurate reading of science and in the new series I'll look at how the
537360	543200	media report science and why they so often get it wrong
