0	5140	Typically you quarantine the sick. When someone has measles you quarantine them.
5140	8980	We've never seen where we quarantine the healthy.
8980	16180	Actually we have. The word quarantine itself comes from the practice of locking down healthy people for 40 days.
16180	21180	Quarantena, in old Italian, when ships arrived in Venice from areas of plague.
21180	26180	In the 17th century the villagers of Iam in England, most of them healthy,
26360	31360	locked themselves down when a few of their number caught bubonic plague.
31360	38360	If you don't recognise this guy, he's Dan Erickson, one of two doctors who held a press conference back in April.
38360	42360	They work for Accelerated Urgent Care in Bakersfield, California.
42360	45360	They specialise in common ailments like these.
45360	53360	And the reason for the press conference was to voice concern that their business was suffering because of Covid-19 restrictions.
53540	60540	This has caused some severe disruption for Accelerated as we have people coming in seven in the morning till midnight
60540	68540	or reporting to the health department or calling patients back and at the same time our volumes have dropped significantly.
68540	73540	Now I'm not unsympathetic to opinions that lockdowns may be doing more harm than good.
73540	80540	After all these doctors, like so many people running a business, have seen a sharp decline in income because of lockdowns.
80720	83720	They also have an adverse effect on mental health.
83720	91720	They increase domestic violence, economic hardship, infringe on civil liberty, raise unemployment and lower GDP.
91720	95720	So I don't mind listening to arguments for and against.
95720	104720	But I do mind when people try to support their case by misrepresenting scientific facts and figures and presenting bogus information.
104720	107720	And that's what's happening here.
107900	113900	They claimed that lockdown isn't necessary because they calculated, wrongly as it turns out,
113900	121900	that the infection fatality rate of Covid-19 is only 0.03%, a third that of flu.
121900	124900	That claim, of course, went viral.
124900	129900	So let's go through their calculation and just buzz in when you spot the mistake.
130080	133080	So if we look at California, these numbers are from yesterday.
133080	141080	We have 33,865 Covid cases out of a total of 280,900 total tested.
141080	145080	That's 12% of Californians were positive for Covid.
145080	148080	Good use of the buzzer.
148080	149080	And you're right.
149080	152080	It's not 12% of Californians who were Covid positive.
152080	155080	It's 12% of the people who got tested.
155260	159260	And they obviously aren't representative of the population as a whole.
159260	166260	Because before mass testing came in, people got tested because they had symptoms or were exposed to the virus
166260	169260	or thought they might have been exposed to the virus.
169260	175260	So there's going to be a much higher percentage of positive cases among those tested during the early weeks of the pandemic
175260	178260	compared to the general population.
178260	182260	It's like doing a survey of a waiting room at a Texas hospital
182440	186440	and then discovering that a third of the people waiting are critically ill.
186440	191440	You can't scale that up and assume that therefore a third of Texans must be critically ill.
191440	195440	So the more you test, the more positives you get.
195440	198440	But that's a classic case of mixing up measurements.
198440	202440	You get more positive cases but the percentage of positive cases
202440	206440	which is what the doctors are measuring for their calculation
206440	209440	doesn't go up, it goes down.
209620	213620	Even if the doctors don't understand the difference between a number and a percentage
213620	215620	which I find hard to believe
215620	218620	all they have to do is look at the data they claim to be using.
218620	222620	As testing expanded to the California population as a whole
222620	225620	shown by the light brown bars on this graph
225620	230620	the number of positive cases went up, shown by the darker brown at the bottom.
230620	234620	But the percentage of positive cases went down
234620	238620	shown by the blue line with the percentage scale on the right hand side.
238800	241800	A month after the doctors held their press conference
241800	243800	far more people were being tested
243800	249800	and of course the positivity rate was down from 12% to around 4.5%.
249800	253800	The doctors' analysis was so bad and so amateurish
253800	256800	that the American College of Emergency Physicians
256800	259800	and the American Academy of Emergency Medicine
259800	263800	took the extraordinary step of issuing a joint statement disowning it.
263980	267980	They called the doctors' claims reckless and untested musings.
269980	273980	I got interested in this topic when someone posted this on the forum
273980	275980	and it seems to be a view that's widely shared.
275980	278980	Listening to the science didn't work out so well
278980	281980	seven months later and a global recession
281980	284980	even Fauci now says on a recent 60 Minutes
284980	288980	he would not shut down the economy when faced with a similar virus.
288980	291980	Actually that's not what Fauci said
292160	296160	but I'm more interested in the idea that listening to the science isn't a good idea.
296160	300160	Because science can't tell you whether lockdowns are the right policy
300160	304160	that's a personal opinion and ultimately a political decision.
304160	309160	All it can tell you is what the epidemiological effects of a lockdown will be
309160	313160	the reproduction rate of the virus, the number of infections
313160	317160	and roughly how many people would die over what period of time.
317160	321160	That's why listening to the science always works out well
321340	325340	because it ensures that when a government weighs the pros and cons of lockdown
325340	328340	it does so on the basis of facts and figures
328340	332340	rather than ideological dogma, blind guesses and wishful thinking.
332340	336340	So what do real scientific studies say about lockdowns?
336340	340340	Lockdown has become a catch-all word to describe
340340	343340	restricted movements, limits on social gatherings
343340	345340	and the closure of certain businesses.
345340	349340	Sometimes the rules are tightened, sometimes they're relaxed
349520	353520	depending on whether the number of cases is rising or falling.
353520	359520	Scientific studies refer to these as restrictions or non-pharmaceutical interventions.
359520	360520	What about Sweden?
360520	362520	Sweden, Sweden, Sweden, Sweden.
362520	365520	Hold on, I'm going to look at Sweden in a minute.
365520	369520	A lot of posters on my channel suggested I take a look at the claims of Ivor Cummins
369520	373520	an Irish biochemical engineer who runs a YouTube channel.
373520	377520	Unlike the Bakersfield doctors, he actually cites scientific studies
377700	379700	which is commendable.
379700	383700	We now have many, many publications, including Lancet
383700	387700	that show clearly, based on the data, that lockdown
387700	391700	barely or does not affect deaths per million outcomes.
391700	395700	Well here's the first one on the list and the one Cummins highlights.
395700	400700	It wasn't published in The Lancet, which is one of the world's top two medical journals
400700	403700	it was published in eClinical Medicine
403700	406700	a separate open access journal owned by The Lancet.
406880	410880	Nevertheless, it concluded that lockdowns don't affect mortality rates
410880	413880	which is supportive of Cummins' claims.
413880	415880	But here's the problem.
415880	418880	When I look for other studies in Lancet-owned journals
418880	420880	and in The Lancet itself
420880	423880	they all reach the opposite conclusion.
423880	427880	They all concluded that lockdowns reduced rates of infection.
427880	430880	Some showed that the stricter lockdown measures were
430880	432880	the more effective they were
432880	435880	and they showed that when the strictest lockdown measures were lifted
436060	439060	infection rates began to rise again.
439060	443060	Picking one study from The Lancet group that supports your case
443060	445060	and ignoring all the others that don't
445060	447060	is called cherry picking
447060	450060	and it's a familiar tactic on social media.
450060	454060	So then I moved on to the second paper on Cummins' list
454060	458060	which was published by a very reputable journal, Science.
458060	461060	It's a shame that Cummins doesn't show the paper
461060	463060	and give a proper citation or link
463060	465060	so that people can read it for themselves.
465240	469240	I could only find the study by doing a search of Google Scholar
469240	472240	using the part of the title that Cummins showed.
472240	474240	It's a paper by Denning et al.
474240	476240	But when I clicked on the link
476240	479240	it turns out that the title of the paper has changed.
479240	481240	According to Cummins, the paper claimed
481240	483240	lockdown had only a minor effect.
483240	485240	In fact, their study
485240	487240	which looked at lockdowns in Germany
487240	490240	found a clear reduction of the spreading rate
490240	492240	related to each governmental intervention.
492240	494240	And it concluded
494420	497420	results suggest that the full extent of government interventions
497420	500420	was necessary to stop exponential growth.
500420	503420	Then I checked the third citation in the list
503420	505420	which turns out to be ambiguous.
505420	508420	There's no such thing as the Koch Institute.
508420	511420	There's the Robert Koch Institute in Germany
511420	513420	a respected government medical agency
513420	516420	that advises on responses to the pandemic.
516420	518420	And there's the Charles Koch Institute
518420	520420	in the United States
520420	522420	an American lobby group that gives frequent opinions
522600	524600	and conclusions on the pandemic
524600	526600	from a political perspective.
526600	528600	If Cummins is citing
528600	530600	the political lobby group
530600	532600	Charles Koch, then its opinions
532600	534600	about the reproduction rate
534600	537600	are irrelevant because it isn't a scientific body.
537600	539600	If Cummins is citing
539600	541600	the scientific institute
541600	543600	the Robert Koch Institute
543600	546600	it's stated very clearly that lockdowns are effective.
546600	548600	In this bulletin
548600	550600	the RKI says
550780	552780	Oh, sorry.
552780	554780	Isolation measures
554780	556780	of confirmed cases and the quarantining
556780	558780	of contact persons lead not only
558780	560780	to a reduction in the number of secondary cases
560780	562780	but also to a shortening of
562780	564780	the generation time.
564780	566780	The RKI even did a review of studies
566780	568780	that looked at the effect of restrictions
568780	570780	and interventions.
570780	572780	It listed the conclusions of each one.
572780	574780	The vast majority
574780	576780	found that restrictions slowed the
576780	578780	reproduction rate of the virus
578960	580960	and reduced the number of cases
580960	582960	or both.
582960	584960	If you want to check them for yourselves
584960	586960	the review is linked in the video description.
586960	588960	Based on this thorough review
588960	590960	of the scientific literature
590960	592960	the RKI doesn't conclude
592960	594960	that lockdowns are ineffective
594960	596960	it says the complete opposite.
596960	598960	In our analysis we find
598960	600960	a strong dose response effect
600960	602960	of restrictions on gatherings
602960	604960	the requirement to wear masks
604960	606960	and the closings of workplaces and schools
607140	609140	and both of the COVID-19 pandemic.
609140	611140	I'm not going to go through the list
611140	613140	and track down every blog article
613140	615140	and study.
615140	617140	That's something Cummins should have done
617140	619140	before he posted it.
619140	621140	But at number 17 I did spot one that I'd already read
621140	623140	in the British Medical Journal
623140	625140	so I knew that Cummins had misrepresented
625140	627140	that one too.
627140	629140	It's not a scientific study
629140	631140	it's a non peer reviewed news article
631140	633140	looking at why Belarus had so few deaths
633140	635140	due to COVID-19.
635320	637320	The likely explanations
637320	639320	the article reports are a high
639320	641320	proportion of hospital beds per thousand
641320	643320	population, 40 times
643320	645320	that of the UK, and a
645320	647320	structural bias towards dealing with
647320	649320	pandemics and mass testing
649320	651320	and very few care homes
651320	653320	and the relative isolation
653320	655320	of the country that means borders
655320	657320	could be easily closed and
657320	659320	travellers monitored.
659320	661320	And finally because Belarus is a dictatorship
661320	663320	where the figures may have been
663320	665320	fudged anyway, some experts
665320	667320	fear that many coronavirus
667320	669320	related deaths are registered
669320	671320	as cases of pneumonia.
671320	673320	Most importantly even if it
673320	675320	had been a scientific study
675320	677320	the article made no conclusion about
677320	679320	the effectiveness of lockdown
679320	681320	and nothing in the article that suggests
681320	683320	lockdowns are ineffective.
683320	685320	So just like numbers two and three
685320	687320	what on earth is it doing on
687320	689320	Cummins' list?
689320	691320	He needs to check all these supposed sources
691320	693320	read them properly, make sure
693320	695320	they're peer reviewed scientific studies and
695320	697320	not newspaper stories or political
697320	699320	blogs, pick out the ones that really
699320	701320	do show that lockdowns are ineffective
701320	703320	and then repost an accurate
703320	705320	list.
705320	707320	If you don't cherry pick and misread
707320	709320	what real scientific studies
709320	711320	show is that lockdowns are effective.
711320	713320	It doesn't mean they're a good
713320	715320	idea, it just means that
715320	717320	they are effective in reducing the spread
717320	719320	of an infectious disease.
719320	721320	That's been known since 14th century
721320	723320	Venice and it's pretty obvious
723320	725320	why. So all other things
725320	727320	being equal the strictest lockdown
727320	729320	measures, which most countries
729320	731320	do when the R8 gets dangerously high
731320	733320	ought to result in a reduction of
733320	735320	Covid-19 cases after
735320	737320	about 10 to 14 days.
737320	739320	And that's exactly what we see.
739320	741320	What about Sweden? Sweden. Sweden.
741320	743320	Sweden. Sweden. Alright, so what
743320	745320	about Sweden? Sweden never
745320	747320	locked down, never mandated masks
747320	749320	never closed their borders,
749320	751320	never closed their under-16 schools,
751320	753320	never closed the restaurants
753320	755320	and bars and did everything they could
755320	757320	to avoid trampling on human rights.
757320	759320	Sweden took an approach based
759320	761320	on science. Well, Tony Heller
761320	763320	did get one thing right. Sweden
763320	765320	took an approach based on science,
765320	767320	just like most countries with a couple
767320	769320	of obvious exceptions.
769320	771320	Swedish epidemiologists know as well
771320	773320	as American or British epidemiologists
773320	775320	that eliminating mass gatherings
775320	777320	and restricting movement
777320	779320	slow the spread of the virus,
779320	781320	including the architect of the Swedish
781320	783320	model Anders Tegnell.
783320	785320	He says people who claim Sweden
785320	787320	didn't have restrictions are
787320	789320	wrong. You're saying
789320	791320	that the strategy here, apart from the face mask
791320	793320	is pretty much the same as everywhere else, is that?
793320	795320	To a great extent, yes.
795320	797320	I mean, we also slow down many
797320	799320	things.
799320	801320	The
801320	803320	domestic air flights
803320	805320	in Sweden were slowed down to
805320	807320	basically nothing. There was no domestic
807320	809320	flights in Sweden anymore.
809320	811320	This was due to people stopped travelling, not because
811320	813320	we made it mandatory for the flights to stop.
813320	815320	Trains were also cut down
815320	817320	quite a lot, so
817320	819320	the society really slowed down
819320	821320	quite a lot also in Sweden.
821320	823320	I think much more than many people in other countries
823320	825320	understand. The reason Tegnell
825320	827320	thought a voluntary system would work
827320	829320	is that Sweden has a number of advantages
829320	831320	over countries outside
831320	833320	of Scandinavia.
833320	835320	For one thing, it has a modern universal
835320	837320	healthcare system that the authorities
837320	839320	calculated had enough ICU
839320	841320	beds to cope with a high number
841320	843320	of COVID cases and treat
843320	845320	them effectively. Secondly,
845320	847320	most Swedes live alone,
847320	849320	and the country isn't a major tourist destination
849320	851320	or a travel crossroads,
851320	853320	so it would be less vulnerable to a rapid
853320	855320	spread of the virus.
855320	857320	Sweden isn't a particularly religious
857320	859320	country, so you don't see many
859320	861320	mass gatherings in churches or mosques.
861320	863320	And most importantly,
863320	865320	imposing rules is probably not
865320	867320	even necessary. After all,
867320	869320	this is the nation that gave us ABBA
869320	871320	and Volvo's. Swedes don't
871320	873320	go around raping and pillaging anymore.
873320	875320	They're a pretty sensible, responsible
875320	877320	people who for the most part follow
877320	879320	government advice.
879320	881320	Isn't that a little racist?
881320	883320	If I like their race,
883320	885320	how can that be racist?
885320	887320	So the authorities opted for guidelines
887320	889320	like these rather than legally
889320	891320	enforced rules. Refrain
891320	893320	from unnecessary journeys,
893320	895320	avoid public transport, don't go
895320	897320	to meetings and concerts, and so on.
897320	899320	Life looks pretty good in Sweden.
899320	901320	Things are open, their schools
901320	903320	are open, their universities are
903320	905320	open. People in Sweden are
905320	907320	going about their lives normally.
907320	909320	Well, not really. A photograph doesn't
909320	911320	tell the whole story.
911320	913320	Sweden may have a more relaxed approach
913320	915320	than countries like Britain and France,
915320	917320	but life in Sweden over the last 11
917320	919320	months has been anything but normal.
919320	921320	As well as the voluntary
921320	923320	guidelines, there are also restrictions
923320	925320	mandated by law.
925320	927320	Crowd sizes at public events
927320	929320	were limited to 50 people,
929320	931320	and as the virus got worse, that number
931320	933320	was reduced to just eight.
933320	935320	Restaurants and bars can only serve
935320	937320	customers who are seated.
937320	939320	Visits to nursing homes are restricted.
939320	941320	There are travel restrictions from other
941320	943320	countries. Twice, schools have
943320	945320	switched to remote learning, and
945320	947320	that's in addition to all the voluntary
947320	949320	guidelines I just showed you regarding
949320	951320	gatherings, social distancing, and
951320	953320	staying home.
953320	955320	A survey by Sweden's Civil Contingencies
955320	957320	Agency suggests that
957320	959320	87% of the population
959320	961320	are continuing to follow social distancing
961320	963320	recommendations, and domestic
963320	965320	airlines are grounded.
965320	967320	And according to Anders Tenjel,
967320	969320	Swedes have only around 30%
969320	971320	of the social interactions that
971320	973320	they did prior to the pandemic.
973320	975320	Sweden travelled a lot less than they
975320	977320	usually do. They actually decreased their
977320	979320	travel more than the travel was
979320	981320	decreased in our Scandinavian
981320	983320	neighbours.
983320	985320	If you ask Swedes,
985320	987320	80-90% of them say that
987320	989320	their lives have been very much affected
989320	991320	by the Covid-19. So
991320	993320	I think you make a mistake if
993320	995320	you think that the Swedish lockdown was
995320	997320	less in place
997320	999320	and was less effective than in many
999320	1001320	places just because it was a voluntary
1001320	1003320	lockdown. So admire the Swedish
1003320	1005320	model by all means, but let's
1005320	1007320	not pretend that life in Sweden has
1007320	1009320	gone on as normal. This is
1009320	1011320	all far from normal.
1011320	1013320	Sweden has reached herd immunity
1013320	1015320	even as the United States
1015320	1017320	panics. But Sweden is nowhere
1017320	1019320	near reaching herd immunity.
1019320	1021320	That's the problem with believing tabloid
1021320	1023320	newspapers like the Daily Mail
1023320	1025320	instead of listening to epidemiologists
1025320	1027320	and checking the figures.
1027320	1029320	Back in May, Professor Bjorn
1029320	1031320	Olsson said herd immunity in
1031320	1033320	Sweden is a long way off
1033320	1035320	if we ever reach it. And in August
1035320	1037320	he co-authored a study showing
1037320	1039320	rates of infection way below the
1039320	1041320	60-70% needed
1041320	1043320	for herd immunity.
1043320	1045320	As did a study commissioned by the
1045320	1047320	Swedish Public Health Agency in May
1047320	1049320	and a third study in December.
1049320	1051320	And even the man
1051320	1053320	every proponent of the Swedish model
1053320	1055320	likes to quote, Anders Tegnell,
1055320	1057320	said as late as November
1057320	1059320	that the issue of herd immunity is
1059320	1061320	difficult and there are no signs
1061320	1063320	of immunity in the population that
1063320	1065320	are slowing down the infection.
1065320	1067320	In this graph you can see the difference
1067320	1069320	between what's going on in Sweden
1069320	1071320	with Dr Anders Tegnell
1071320	1073320	versus the US with Dr Fauci.
1073320	1075320	But of course the United States
1075320	1077320	is doing even worse than Sweden.
1077320	1079320	Anders Tegnell was put in charge
1079320	1081320	of Sweden's pandemic policy
1081320	1083320	while Anthony Fauci had no
1083320	1085320	executive power at all.
1085320	1087320	He could only advise a president
1087320	1089320	who routinely ignored his advice.
1089320	1091320	So while Sweden had a national
1091320	1093320	plan led by an epidemiologist
1093320	1095320	the United States had none
1095320	1097320	led by a politician.
1097320	1099320	And there are other differences.
1099320	1101320	Sweden had a universal healthcare
1101320	1103320	system which could cope with a
1103320	1105320	pandemic and where everyone could get
1105320	1107320	treated free of charge.
1107320	1109320	Whether you think that's a good thing or a bad thing
1109320	1111320	it's something the United States
1111320	1113320	doesn't have.
1113320	1115320	And unlike Sweden where few people go to church
1115320	1117320	millions of Americans continued
1117320	1119320	to pack places of worship.
1119320	1121320	And Swedes are pretty healthy.
1121320	1123320	Compare the level of diabetes
1123320	1125320	in Sweden with that of the
1125320	1127320	United States.
1127320	1129320	This is the level of obesity in Sweden
1129320	1131320	compared to the USA.
1131320	1133320	And while most domestic
1133320	1135320	flights in Sweden were grounded
1135320	1137320	in the United States they continued
1137320	1139320	flying. And most Swedes
1139320	1141320	followed government guidelines and restrictions.
1141320	1143320	In the United States these
1143320	1145320	varied from state to state and
1145320	1147320	were often ignored even by the
1147320	1149320	leader of the country. And even
1149320	1151320	by politicians urging others to follow
1151320	1153320	the guidelines.
1153320	1155320	So why would anyone be surprised that the
1155320	1157320	American death toll was higher?
1157320	1159320	To see how Sweden's been doing
1159320	1161320	it's no good comparing it to countries with
1161320	1163320	completely different population densities
1163320	1165320	different obesity levels
1165320	1167320	different healthcare systems and different
1167320	1169320	cultures. You need to compare it with
1169320	1171320	countries where all those things are similar.
1171320	1173320	And that's not hard.
1173320	1175320	Sweden's neighbours have very
1175320	1177320	similar profiles in all those respects.
1177320	1179320	The only significant differences
1179320	1181320	were mandatory lockdowns
1181320	1183320	versus voluntary lockdown
1183320	1185320	and policies on mask wearing, test
1185320	1187320	and trace.
1187320	1189320	The result? At the time of writing
1189320	1191320	Sweden has a mortality rate
1191320	1193320	in other words the number of deaths per million people
1193320	1195320	four times that of Denmark
1195320	1197320	eight times that of Finland
1197320	1199320	and ten times that of Norway.
1199320	1201320	And now even mainstream
1201320	1203320	media outlets like Newsweek
1203320	1205320	are acknowledging the fact that they succeeded.
1205320	1207320	Well that may be Newsweek's
1207320	1209320	opinion, but opinion is not
1209320	1211320	fact. If the United States
1211320	1213320	had the same mortality rate as Sweden
1213320	1215320	then instead of having 260,000
1215320	1217320	deaths at the time of writing
1217320	1219320	it would have had 210,000
1219320	1221320	deaths.
1221320	1223320	People can have their own opinions about whether
1223320	1225320	that's a success, but they aren't
1225320	1227320	entitled to change the facts to
1227320	1229320	fit that opinion.
1229320	1231320	So what's my opinion?
1231320	1233320	Well of course the whole point of this channel is not
1233320	1235320	to tell you what I think, but to
1235320	1237320	fact check the claims of those who do
1237320	1239320	give you their opinion and to present
1239320	1241320	facts so you can form your own opinion.
1241320	1243320	You just can't
1243320	1245320	borrow someone else's opinion off the shelf
1245320	1247320	or beat the drum for a team.
1247320	1249320	You have to answer questions
1249320	1251320	that are rather difficult to answer.
1251320	1253320	For example, apart from the
1253320	1255320	fatalities caused by COVID-19
1255320	1257320	how do we assess the downside
1257320	1259320	of millions of people who didn't die
1259320	1261320	but continue to feel the effects?
1261320	1263320	I also wanted to mention that 96%
1263320	1265320	of people in California who get COVID
1265320	1267320	recover with almost no significant
1267320	1269320	sequelae, or no significant
1269320	1271320	continuing medical
1271320	1273320	problems. But where does that
1273320	1275320	figure come from? That's the
1275320	1277320	trouble with doing science by press conference.
1277320	1279320	There's a tendency to dream up
1279320	1281320	some figures on the back of an envelope
1281320	1283320	and throw others out with a confident
1283320	1285320	knowledge they can't be checked.
1285320	1287320	Ericsson is saying that only
1287320	1289320	about 4% of people suffer
1289320	1291320	long-term effects from COVID-19.
1291320	1293320	It's impossible to say if Ericsson
1293320	1295320	got that figure from a reliable source
1295320	1297320	or made a mistake, or found
1297320	1299320	it in a blog, or simply made it
1299320	1301320	up. All I can do is
1301320	1303320	cite proper studies and real figures
1303320	1305320	which do have sources you can
1305320	1307320	check. For example, a British
1307320	1309320	study found that 10% of people
1309320	1311320	experience prolonged illness after
1311320	1313320	COVID-19. A paper
1313320	1315320	in the Journal of the American Medical Association
1315320	1317320	found that 71% of
1317320	1319320	COVID cases in Italy had
1319320	1321320	symptoms during infection,
1321320	1323320	and of those, 32%
1323320	1325320	still had one or two symptoms two months
1325320	1327320	later, and 44%
1327320	1329320	had a worse quality of life.
1329320	1331320	Another US study found that
1331320	1333320	only 35% of people
1333320	1335320	didn't return to their previous level of
1335320	1337320	health two to three weeks after
1337320	1339320	a positive test.
1339320	1341320	It's known as long-COVID,
1341320	1343320	the long-term health problems brought on
1343320	1345320	by COVID-19.
1345320	1347320	Symptoms range from fatigue and joint
1347320	1349320	pain to chest pain and
1349320	1351320	diarrhoea, and more seriously heart
1351320	1353320	problems and breathing difficulties.
1353320	1355320	I sympathise with people like
1355320	1357320	the Bakersfield doctors whose businesses
1357320	1359320	are suffering, but giving misinformation
1359320	1361320	like that isn't helping.
1361320	1363320	If we, as Tony Abbott
1363320	1365320	suggested, let nature run its course
1365320	1367320	and take no action to curb the virus,
1367320	1369320	would these doctors be back in business
1369320	1371320	or would patients be even
1371320	1373320	less likely to visit their hospital?
1373320	1375320	Would it make businesses
1375320	1377320	like cafes, bars and movie theatres
1377320	1379320	more popular, or would
1379320	1381320	people be worried about an uncontrolled
1381320	1383320	pandemic and stay away?
1383320	1385320	In other words, would keeping
1385320	1387320	everything open and letting
1387320	1389320	the pandemic run its course
1389320	1391320	result in better economic conditions
1391320	1393320	or worse?
1393320	1395320	And what about the people who work in these places
1395320	1397320	and interact with a heavily infected
1397320	1399320	public? Is it fair
1399320	1401320	to ask them to risk their lives,
1401320	1403320	and if they refuse, would it be fair
1403320	1405320	to sack them? And if people
1405320	1407320	were free to contract COVID, which
1407320	1409320	is surely their right, is
1409320	1411320	that fair on people they might
1411320	1413320	infect, or on hospital staff who
1413320	1415320	would then have to risk their lives treating
1415320	1417320	these people? And how do
1417320	1419320	we factor in the cost of lockdown
1419320	1421320	in terms of mental health,
1421320	1423320	educational setback, how do you
1423320	1425320	assess that level of pain felt by
1425320	1427320	millions of people under lockdown
1427320	1429320	and then compare it to, say, the
1429320	1431320	pain of losing a loved one or
1431320	1433320	the suffering caused by long COVID?
1433320	1435320	I know that borrowing
1435320	1437320	an opinion off the shelf is very
1437320	1439320	simple, quick and easy, and
1439320	1441320	thinking about questions like these,
1441320	1443320	weighing them in the balance and checking
1443320	1445320	all the facts and figures is
1445320	1447320	much harder work.
1447320	1449320	But if you're going to voice an opinion and
1449320	1451320	hold that opinion very firmly,
1451320	1453320	then I hope you have weighed each of these
1453320	1455320	questions carefully and are very
1455320	1457320	sure of your answers.
1477320	1479320	Thank you.
