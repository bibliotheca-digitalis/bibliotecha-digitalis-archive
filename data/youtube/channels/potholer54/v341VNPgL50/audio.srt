1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,140
Typically you quarantine the sick. When someone has measles you quarantine them.

2
00:00:05,140 --> 00:00:08,980
We've never seen where we quarantine the healthy.

3
00:00:08,980 --> 00:00:16,180
Actually we have. The word quarantine itself comes from the practice of locking down healthy people for 40 days.

4
00:00:16,180 --> 00:00:21,180
Quarantena, in old Italian, when ships arrived in Venice from areas of plague.

5
00:00:21,180 --> 00:00:26,180
In the 17th century the villagers of Iam in England, most of them healthy,

6
00:00:26,360 --> 00:00:31,360
locked themselves down when a few of their number caught bubonic plague.

7
00:00:31,360 --> 00:00:38,360
If you don't recognise this guy, he's Dan Erickson, one of two doctors who held a press conference back in April.

8
00:00:38,360 --> 00:00:42,360
They work for Accelerated Urgent Care in Bakersfield, California.

9
00:00:42,360 --> 00:00:45,360
They specialise in common ailments like these.

10
00:00:45,360 --> 00:00:53,360
And the reason for the press conference was to voice concern that their business was suffering because of Covid-19 restrictions.

11
00:00:53,540 --> 00:01:00,540
This has caused some severe disruption for Accelerated as we have people coming in seven in the morning till midnight

12
00:01:00,540 --> 00:01:08,540
or reporting to the health department or calling patients back and at the same time our volumes have dropped significantly.

13
00:01:08,540 --> 00:01:13,540
Now I'm not unsympathetic to opinions that lockdowns may be doing more harm than good.

14
00:01:13,540 --> 00:01:20,540
After all these doctors, like so many people running a business, have seen a sharp decline in income because of lockdowns.

15
00:01:20,720 --> 00:01:23,720
They also have an adverse effect on mental health.

16
00:01:23,720 --> 00:01:31,720
They increase domestic violence, economic hardship, infringe on civil liberty, raise unemployment and lower GDP.

17
00:01:31,720 --> 00:01:35,720
So I don't mind listening to arguments for and against.

18
00:01:35,720 --> 00:01:44,720
But I do mind when people try to support their case by misrepresenting scientific facts and figures and presenting bogus information.

19
00:01:44,720 --> 00:01:47,720
And that's what's happening here.

20
00:01:47,900 --> 00:01:53,900
They claimed that lockdown isn't necessary because they calculated, wrongly as it turns out,

21
00:01:53,900 --> 00:02:01,900
that the infection fatality rate of Covid-19 is only 0.03%, a third that of flu.

22
00:02:01,900 --> 00:02:04,900
That claim, of course, went viral.

23
00:02:04,900 --> 00:02:09,900
So let's go through their calculation and just buzz in when you spot the mistake.

24
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:13,080
So if we look at California, these numbers are from yesterday.

25
00:02:13,080 --> 00:02:21,080
We have 33,865 Covid cases out of a total of 280,900 total tested.

26
00:02:21,080 --> 00:02:25,080
That's 12% of Californians were positive for Covid.

27
00:02:25,080 --> 00:02:28,080
Good use of the buzzer.

28
00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:29,080
And you're right.

29
00:02:29,080 --> 00:02:32,080
It's not 12% of Californians who were Covid positive.

30
00:02:32,080 --> 00:02:35,080
It's 12% of the people who got tested.

31
00:02:35,260 --> 00:02:39,260
And they obviously aren't representative of the population as a whole.

32
00:02:39,260 --> 00:02:46,260
Because before mass testing came in, people got tested because they had symptoms or were exposed to the virus

33
00:02:46,260 --> 00:02:49,260
or thought they might have been exposed to the virus.

34
00:02:49,260 --> 00:02:55,260
So there's going to be a much higher percentage of positive cases among those tested during the early weeks of the pandemic

35
00:02:55,260 --> 00:02:58,260
compared to the general population.

36
00:02:58,260 --> 00:03:02,260
It's like doing a survey of a waiting room at a Texas hospital

37
00:03:02,440 --> 00:03:06,440
and then discovering that a third of the people waiting are critically ill.

38
00:03:06,440 --> 00:03:11,440
You can't scale that up and assume that therefore a third of Texans must be critically ill.

39
00:03:11,440 --> 00:03:15,440
So the more you test, the more positives you get.

40
00:03:15,440 --> 00:03:18,440
But that's a classic case of mixing up measurements.

41
00:03:18,440 --> 00:03:22,440
You get more positive cases but the percentage of positive cases

42
00:03:22,440 --> 00:03:26,440
which is what the doctors are measuring for their calculation

43
00:03:26,440 --> 00:03:29,440
doesn't go up, it goes down.

44
00:03:29,620 --> 00:03:33,620
Even if the doctors don't understand the difference between a number and a percentage

45
00:03:33,620 --> 00:03:35,620
which I find hard to believe

46
00:03:35,620 --> 00:03:38,620
all they have to do is look at the data they claim to be using.

47
00:03:38,620 --> 00:03:42,620
As testing expanded to the California population as a whole

48
00:03:42,620 --> 00:03:45,620
shown by the light brown bars on this graph

49
00:03:45,620 --> 00:03:50,620
the number of positive cases went up, shown by the darker brown at the bottom.

50
00:03:50,620 --> 00:03:54,620
But the percentage of positive cases went down

51
00:03:54,620 --> 00:03:58,620
shown by the blue line with the percentage scale on the right hand side.

52
00:03:58,800 --> 00:04:01,800
A month after the doctors held their press conference

53
00:04:01,800 --> 00:04:03,800
far more people were being tested

54
00:04:03,800 --> 00:04:09,800
and of course the positivity rate was down from 12% to around 4.5%.

55
00:04:09,800 --> 00:04:13,800
The doctors' analysis was so bad and so amateurish

56
00:04:13,800 --> 00:04:16,800
that the American College of Emergency Physicians

57
00:04:16,800 --> 00:04:19,800
and the American Academy of Emergency Medicine

58
00:04:19,800 --> 00:04:23,800
took the extraordinary step of issuing a joint statement disowning it.

59
00:04:23,980 --> 00:04:27,980
They called the doctors' claims reckless and untested musings.

60
00:04:29,980 --> 00:04:33,980
I got interested in this topic when someone posted this on the forum

61
00:04:33,980 --> 00:04:35,980
and it seems to be a view that's widely shared.

62
00:04:35,980 --> 00:04:38,980
Listening to the science didn't work out so well

63
00:04:38,980 --> 00:04:41,980
seven months later and a global recession

64
00:04:41,980 --> 00:04:44,980
even Fauci now says on a recent 60 Minutes

65
00:04:44,980 --> 00:04:48,980
he would not shut down the economy when faced with a similar virus.

66
00:04:48,980 --> 00:04:51,980
Actually that's not what Fauci said

67
00:04:52,160 --> 00:04:56,160
but I'm more interested in the idea that listening to the science isn't a good idea.

68
00:04:56,160 --> 00:05:00,160
Because science can't tell you whether lockdowns are the right policy

69
00:05:00,160 --> 00:05:04,160
that's a personal opinion and ultimately a political decision.

70
00:05:04,160 --> 00:05:09,160
All it can tell you is what the epidemiological effects of a lockdown will be

71
00:05:09,160 --> 00:05:13,160
the reproduction rate of the virus, the number of infections

72
00:05:13,160 --> 00:05:17,160
and roughly how many people would die over what period of time.

73
00:05:17,160 --> 00:05:21,160
That's why listening to the science always works out well

74
00:05:21,340 --> 00:05:25,340
because it ensures that when a government weighs the pros and cons of lockdown

75
00:05:25,340 --> 00:05:28,340
it does so on the basis of facts and figures

76
00:05:28,340 --> 00:05:32,340
rather than ideological dogma, blind guesses and wishful thinking.

77
00:05:32,340 --> 00:05:36,340
So what do real scientific studies say about lockdowns?

78
00:05:36,340 --> 00:05:40,340
Lockdown has become a catch-all word to describe

79
00:05:40,340 --> 00:05:43,340
restricted movements, limits on social gatherings

80
00:05:43,340 --> 00:05:45,340
and the closure of certain businesses.

81
00:05:45,340 --> 00:05:49,340
Sometimes the rules are tightened, sometimes they're relaxed

82
00:05:49,520 --> 00:05:53,520
depending on whether the number of cases is rising or falling.

83
00:05:53,520 --> 00:05:59,520
Scientific studies refer to these as restrictions or non-pharmaceutical interventions.

84
00:05:59,520 --> 00:06:00,520
What about Sweden?

85
00:06:00,520 --> 00:06:02,520
Sweden, Sweden, Sweden, Sweden.

86
00:06:02,520 --> 00:06:05,520
Hold on, I'm going to look at Sweden in a minute.

87
00:06:05,520 --> 00:06:09,520
A lot of posters on my channel suggested I take a look at the claims of Ivor Cummins

88
00:06:09,520 --> 00:06:13,520
an Irish biochemical engineer who runs a YouTube channel.

89
00:06:13,520 --> 00:06:17,520
Unlike the Bakersfield doctors, he actually cites scientific studies

90
00:06:17,700 --> 00:06:19,700
which is commendable.

91
00:06:19,700 --> 00:06:23,700
We now have many, many publications, including Lancet

92
00:06:23,700 --> 00:06:27,700
that show clearly, based on the data, that lockdown

93
00:06:27,700 --> 00:06:31,700
barely or does not affect deaths per million outcomes.

94
00:06:31,700 --> 00:06:35,700
Well here's the first one on the list and the one Cummins highlights.

95
00:06:35,700 --> 00:06:40,700
It wasn't published in The Lancet, which is one of the world's top two medical journals

96
00:06:40,700 --> 00:06:43,700
it was published in eClinical Medicine

97
00:06:43,700 --> 00:06:46,700
a separate open access journal owned by The Lancet.

98
00:06:46,880 --> 00:06:50,880
Nevertheless, it concluded that lockdowns don't affect mortality rates

99
00:06:50,880 --> 00:06:53,880
which is supportive of Cummins' claims.

100
00:06:53,880 --> 00:06:55,880
But here's the problem.

101
00:06:55,880 --> 00:06:58,880
When I look for other studies in Lancet-owned journals

102
00:06:58,880 --> 00:07:00,880
and in The Lancet itself

103
00:07:00,880 --> 00:07:03,880
they all reach the opposite conclusion.

104
00:07:03,880 --> 00:07:07,880
They all concluded that lockdowns reduced rates of infection.

105
00:07:07,880 --> 00:07:10,880
Some showed that the stricter lockdown measures were

106
00:07:10,880 --> 00:07:12,880
the more effective they were

107
00:07:12,880 --> 00:07:15,880
and they showed that when the strictest lockdown measures were lifted

108
00:07:16,060 --> 00:07:19,060
infection rates began to rise again.

109
00:07:19,060 --> 00:07:23,060
Picking one study from The Lancet group that supports your case

110
00:07:23,060 --> 00:07:25,060
and ignoring all the others that don't

111
00:07:25,060 --> 00:07:27,060
is called cherry picking

112
00:07:27,060 --> 00:07:30,060
and it's a familiar tactic on social media.

113
00:07:30,060 --> 00:07:34,060
So then I moved on to the second paper on Cummins' list

114
00:07:34,060 --> 00:07:38,060
which was published by a very reputable journal, Science.

115
00:07:38,060 --> 00:07:41,060
It's a shame that Cummins doesn't show the paper

116
00:07:41,060 --> 00:07:43,060
and give a proper citation or link

117
00:07:43,060 --> 00:07:45,060
so that people can read it for themselves.

118
00:07:45,240 --> 00:07:49,240
I could only find the study by doing a search of Google Scholar

119
00:07:49,240 --> 00:07:52,240
using the part of the title that Cummins showed.

120
00:07:52,240 --> 00:07:54,240
It's a paper by Denning et al.

121
00:07:54,240 --> 00:07:56,240
But when I clicked on the link

122
00:07:56,240 --> 00:07:59,240
it turns out that the title of the paper has changed.

123
00:07:59,240 --> 00:08:01,240
According to Cummins, the paper claimed

124
00:08:01,240 --> 00:08:03,240
lockdown had only a minor effect.

125
00:08:03,240 --> 00:08:05,240
In fact, their study

126
00:08:05,240 --> 00:08:07,240
which looked at lockdowns in Germany

127
00:08:07,240 --> 00:08:10,240
found a clear reduction of the spreading rate

128
00:08:10,240 --> 00:08:12,240
related to each governmental intervention.

129
00:08:12,240 --> 00:08:14,240
And it concluded

130
00:08:14,420 --> 00:08:17,420
results suggest that the full extent of government interventions

131
00:08:17,420 --> 00:08:20,420
was necessary to stop exponential growth.

132
00:08:20,420 --> 00:08:23,420
Then I checked the third citation in the list

133
00:08:23,420 --> 00:08:25,420
which turns out to be ambiguous.

134
00:08:25,420 --> 00:08:28,420
There's no such thing as the Koch Institute.

135
00:08:28,420 --> 00:08:31,420
There's the Robert Koch Institute in Germany

136
00:08:31,420 --> 00:08:33,420
a respected government medical agency

137
00:08:33,420 --> 00:08:36,420
that advises on responses to the pandemic.

138
00:08:36,420 --> 00:08:38,420
And there's the Charles Koch Institute

139
00:08:38,420 --> 00:08:40,420
in the United States

140
00:08:40,420 --> 00:08:42,420
an American lobby group that gives frequent opinions

141
00:08:42,600 --> 00:08:44,600
and conclusions on the pandemic

142
00:08:44,600 --> 00:08:46,600
from a political perspective.

143
00:08:46,600 --> 00:08:48,600
If Cummins is citing

144
00:08:48,600 --> 00:08:50,600
the political lobby group

145
00:08:50,600 --> 00:08:52,600
Charles Koch, then its opinions

146
00:08:52,600 --> 00:08:54,600
about the reproduction rate

147
00:08:54,600 --> 00:08:57,600
are irrelevant because it isn't a scientific body.

148
00:08:57,600 --> 00:08:59,600
If Cummins is citing

149
00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:01,600
the scientific institute

150
00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:03,600
the Robert Koch Institute

151
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:06,600
it's stated very clearly that lockdowns are effective.

152
00:09:06,600 --> 00:09:08,600
In this bulletin

153
00:09:08,600 --> 00:09:10,600
the RKI says

154
00:09:10,780 --> 00:09:12,780
Oh, sorry.

155
00:09:12,780 --> 00:09:14,780
Isolation measures

156
00:09:14,780 --> 00:09:16,780
of confirmed cases and the quarantining

157
00:09:16,780 --> 00:09:18,780
of contact persons lead not only

158
00:09:18,780 --> 00:09:20,780
to a reduction in the number of secondary cases

159
00:09:20,780 --> 00:09:22,780
but also to a shortening of

160
00:09:22,780 --> 00:09:24,780
the generation time.

161
00:09:24,780 --> 00:09:26,780
The RKI even did a review of studies

162
00:09:26,780 --> 00:09:28,780
that looked at the effect of restrictions

163
00:09:28,780 --> 00:09:30,780
and interventions.

164
00:09:30,780 --> 00:09:32,780
It listed the conclusions of each one.

165
00:09:32,780 --> 00:09:34,780
The vast majority

166
00:09:34,780 --> 00:09:36,780
found that restrictions slowed the

167
00:09:36,780 --> 00:09:38,780
reproduction rate of the virus

168
00:09:38,960 --> 00:09:40,960
and reduced the number of cases

169
00:09:40,960 --> 00:09:42,960
or both.

170
00:09:42,960 --> 00:09:44,960
If you want to check them for yourselves

171
00:09:44,960 --> 00:09:46,960
the review is linked in the video description.

172
00:09:46,960 --> 00:09:48,960
Based on this thorough review

173
00:09:48,960 --> 00:09:50,960
of the scientific literature

174
00:09:50,960 --> 00:09:52,960
the RKI doesn't conclude

175
00:09:52,960 --> 00:09:54,960
that lockdowns are ineffective

176
00:09:54,960 --> 00:09:56,960
it says the complete opposite.

177
00:09:56,960 --> 00:09:58,960
In our analysis we find

178
00:09:58,960 --> 00:10:00,960
a strong dose response effect

179
00:10:00,960 --> 00:10:02,960
of restrictions on gatherings

180
00:10:02,960 --> 00:10:04,960
the requirement to wear masks

181
00:10:04,960 --> 00:10:06,960
and the closings of workplaces and schools

182
00:10:07,140 --> 00:10:09,140
and both of the COVID-19 pandemic.

183
00:10:09,140 --> 00:10:11,140
I'm not going to go through the list

184
00:10:11,140 --> 00:10:13,140
and track down every blog article

185
00:10:13,140 --> 00:10:15,140
and study.

186
00:10:15,140 --> 00:10:17,140
That's something Cummins should have done

187
00:10:17,140 --> 00:10:19,140
before he posted it.

188
00:10:19,140 --> 00:10:21,140
But at number 17 I did spot one that I'd already read

189
00:10:21,140 --> 00:10:23,140
in the British Medical Journal

190
00:10:23,140 --> 00:10:25,140
so I knew that Cummins had misrepresented

191
00:10:25,140 --> 00:10:27,140
that one too.

192
00:10:27,140 --> 00:10:29,140
It's not a scientific study

193
00:10:29,140 --> 00:10:31,140
it's a non peer reviewed news article

194
00:10:31,140 --> 00:10:33,140
looking at why Belarus had so few deaths

195
00:10:33,140 --> 00:10:35,140
due to COVID-19.

196
00:10:35,320 --> 00:10:37,320
The likely explanations

197
00:10:37,320 --> 00:10:39,320
the article reports are a high

198
00:10:39,320 --> 00:10:41,320
proportion of hospital beds per thousand

199
00:10:41,320 --> 00:10:43,320
population, 40 times

200
00:10:43,320 --> 00:10:45,320
that of the UK, and a

201
00:10:45,320 --> 00:10:47,320
structural bias towards dealing with

202
00:10:47,320 --> 00:10:49,320
pandemics and mass testing

203
00:10:49,320 --> 00:10:51,320
and very few care homes

204
00:10:51,320 --> 00:10:53,320
and the relative isolation

205
00:10:53,320 --> 00:10:55,320
of the country that means borders

206
00:10:55,320 --> 00:10:57,320
could be easily closed and

207
00:10:57,320 --> 00:10:59,320
travellers monitored.

208
00:10:59,320 --> 00:11:01,320
And finally because Belarus is a dictatorship

209
00:11:01,320 --> 00:11:03,320
where the figures may have been

210
00:11:03,320 --> 00:11:05,320
fudged anyway, some experts

211
00:11:05,320 --> 00:11:07,320
fear that many coronavirus

212
00:11:07,320 --> 00:11:09,320
related deaths are registered

213
00:11:09,320 --> 00:11:11,320
as cases of pneumonia.

214
00:11:11,320 --> 00:11:13,320
Most importantly even if it

215
00:11:13,320 --> 00:11:15,320
had been a scientific study

216
00:11:15,320 --> 00:11:17,320
the article made no conclusion about

217
00:11:17,320 --> 00:11:19,320
the effectiveness of lockdown

218
00:11:19,320 --> 00:11:21,320
and nothing in the article that suggests

219
00:11:21,320 --> 00:11:23,320
lockdowns are ineffective.

220
00:11:23,320 --> 00:11:25,320
So just like numbers two and three

221
00:11:25,320 --> 00:11:27,320
what on earth is it doing on

222
00:11:27,320 --> 00:11:29,320
Cummins' list?

223
00:11:29,320 --> 00:11:31,320
He needs to check all these supposed sources

224
00:11:31,320 --> 00:11:33,320
read them properly, make sure

225
00:11:33,320 --> 00:11:35,320
they're peer reviewed scientific studies and

226
00:11:35,320 --> 00:11:37,320
not newspaper stories or political

227
00:11:37,320 --> 00:11:39,320
blogs, pick out the ones that really

228
00:11:39,320 --> 00:11:41,320
do show that lockdowns are ineffective

229
00:11:41,320 --> 00:11:43,320
and then repost an accurate

230
00:11:43,320 --> 00:11:45,320
list.

231
00:11:45,320 --> 00:11:47,320
If you don't cherry pick and misread

232
00:11:47,320 --> 00:11:49,320
what real scientific studies

233
00:11:49,320 --> 00:11:51,320
show is that lockdowns are effective.

234
00:11:51,320 --> 00:11:53,320
It doesn't mean they're a good

235
00:11:53,320 --> 00:11:55,320
idea, it just means that

236
00:11:55,320 --> 00:11:57,320
they are effective in reducing the spread

237
00:11:57,320 --> 00:11:59,320
of an infectious disease.

238
00:11:59,320 --> 00:12:01,320
That's been known since 14th century

239
00:12:01,320 --> 00:12:03,320
Venice and it's pretty obvious

240
00:12:03,320 --> 00:12:05,320
why. So all other things

241
00:12:05,320 --> 00:12:07,320
being equal the strictest lockdown

242
00:12:07,320 --> 00:12:09,320
measures, which most countries

243
00:12:09,320 --> 00:12:11,320
do when the R8 gets dangerously high

244
00:12:11,320 --> 00:12:13,320
ought to result in a reduction of

245
00:12:13,320 --> 00:12:15,320
Covid-19 cases after

246
00:12:15,320 --> 00:12:17,320
about 10 to 14 days.

247
00:12:17,320 --> 00:12:19,320
And that's exactly what we see.

248
00:12:19,320 --> 00:12:21,320
What about Sweden? Sweden. Sweden.

249
00:12:21,320 --> 00:12:23,320
Sweden. Sweden. Alright, so what

250
00:12:23,320 --> 00:12:25,320
about Sweden? Sweden never

251
00:12:25,320 --> 00:12:27,320
locked down, never mandated masks

252
00:12:27,320 --> 00:12:29,320
never closed their borders,

253
00:12:29,320 --> 00:12:31,320
never closed their under-16 schools,

254
00:12:31,320 --> 00:12:33,320
never closed the restaurants

255
00:12:33,320 --> 00:12:35,320
and bars and did everything they could

256
00:12:35,320 --> 00:12:37,320
to avoid trampling on human rights.

257
00:12:37,320 --> 00:12:39,320
Sweden took an approach based

258
00:12:39,320 --> 00:12:41,320
on science. Well, Tony Heller

259
00:12:41,320 --> 00:12:43,320
did get one thing right. Sweden

260
00:12:43,320 --> 00:12:45,320
took an approach based on science,

261
00:12:45,320 --> 00:12:47,320
just like most countries with a couple

262
00:12:47,320 --> 00:12:49,320
of obvious exceptions.

263
00:12:49,320 --> 00:12:51,320
Swedish epidemiologists know as well

264
00:12:51,320 --> 00:12:53,320
as American or British epidemiologists

265
00:12:53,320 --> 00:12:55,320
that eliminating mass gatherings

266
00:12:55,320 --> 00:12:57,320
and restricting movement

267
00:12:57,320 --> 00:12:59,320
slow the spread of the virus,

268
00:12:59,320 --> 00:13:01,320
including the architect of the Swedish

269
00:13:01,320 --> 00:13:03,320
model Anders Tegnell.

270
00:13:03,320 --> 00:13:05,320
He says people who claim Sweden

271
00:13:05,320 --> 00:13:07,320
didn't have restrictions are

272
00:13:07,320 --> 00:13:09,320
wrong. You're saying

273
00:13:09,320 --> 00:13:11,320
that the strategy here, apart from the face mask

274
00:13:11,320 --> 00:13:13,320
is pretty much the same as everywhere else, is that?

275
00:13:13,320 --> 00:13:15,320
To a great extent, yes.

276
00:13:15,320 --> 00:13:17,320
I mean, we also slow down many

277
00:13:17,320 --> 00:13:19,320
things.

278
00:13:19,320 --> 00:13:21,320
The

279
00:13:21,320 --> 00:13:23,320
domestic air flights

280
00:13:23,320 --> 00:13:25,320
in Sweden were slowed down to

281
00:13:25,320 --> 00:13:27,320
basically nothing. There was no domestic

282
00:13:27,320 --> 00:13:29,320
flights in Sweden anymore.

283
00:13:29,320 --> 00:13:31,320
This was due to people stopped travelling, not because

284
00:13:31,320 --> 00:13:33,320
we made it mandatory for the flights to stop.

285
00:13:33,320 --> 00:13:35,320
Trains were also cut down

286
00:13:35,320 --> 00:13:37,320
quite a lot, so

287
00:13:37,320 --> 00:13:39,320
the society really slowed down

288
00:13:39,320 --> 00:13:41,320
quite a lot also in Sweden.

289
00:13:41,320 --> 00:13:43,320
I think much more than many people in other countries

290
00:13:43,320 --> 00:13:45,320
understand. The reason Tegnell

291
00:13:45,320 --> 00:13:47,320
thought a voluntary system would work

292
00:13:47,320 --> 00:13:49,320
is that Sweden has a number of advantages

293
00:13:49,320 --> 00:13:51,320
over countries outside

294
00:13:51,320 --> 00:13:53,320
of Scandinavia.

295
00:13:53,320 --> 00:13:55,320
For one thing, it has a modern universal

296
00:13:55,320 --> 00:13:57,320
healthcare system that the authorities

297
00:13:57,320 --> 00:13:59,320
calculated had enough ICU

298
00:13:59,320 --> 00:14:01,320
beds to cope with a high number

299
00:14:01,320 --> 00:14:03,320
of COVID cases and treat

300
00:14:03,320 --> 00:14:05,320
them effectively. Secondly,

301
00:14:05,320 --> 00:14:07,320
most Swedes live alone,

302
00:14:07,320 --> 00:14:09,320
and the country isn't a major tourist destination

303
00:14:09,320 --> 00:14:11,320
or a travel crossroads,

304
00:14:11,320 --> 00:14:13,320
so it would be less vulnerable to a rapid

305
00:14:13,320 --> 00:14:15,320
spread of the virus.

306
00:14:15,320 --> 00:14:17,320
Sweden isn't a particularly religious

307
00:14:17,320 --> 00:14:19,320
country, so you don't see many

308
00:14:19,320 --> 00:14:21,320
mass gatherings in churches or mosques.

309
00:14:21,320 --> 00:14:23,320
And most importantly,

310
00:14:23,320 --> 00:14:25,320
imposing rules is probably not

311
00:14:25,320 --> 00:14:27,320
even necessary. After all,

312
00:14:27,320 --> 00:14:29,320
this is the nation that gave us ABBA

313
00:14:29,320 --> 00:14:31,320
and Volvo's. Swedes don't

314
00:14:31,320 --> 00:14:33,320
go around raping and pillaging anymore.

315
00:14:33,320 --> 00:14:35,320
They're a pretty sensible, responsible

316
00:14:35,320 --> 00:14:37,320
people who for the most part follow

317
00:14:37,320 --> 00:14:39,320
government advice.

318
00:14:39,320 --> 00:14:41,320
Isn't that a little racist?

319
00:14:41,320 --> 00:14:43,320
If I like their race,

320
00:14:43,320 --> 00:14:45,320
how can that be racist?

321
00:14:45,320 --> 00:14:47,320
So the authorities opted for guidelines

322
00:14:47,320 --> 00:14:49,320
like these rather than legally

323
00:14:49,320 --> 00:14:51,320
enforced rules. Refrain

324
00:14:51,320 --> 00:14:53,320
from unnecessary journeys,

325
00:14:53,320 --> 00:14:55,320
avoid public transport, don't go

326
00:14:55,320 --> 00:14:57,320
to meetings and concerts, and so on.

327
00:14:57,320 --> 00:14:59,320
Life looks pretty good in Sweden.

328
00:14:59,320 --> 00:15:01,320
Things are open, their schools

329
00:15:01,320 --> 00:15:03,320
are open, their universities are

330
00:15:03,320 --> 00:15:05,320
open. People in Sweden are

331
00:15:05,320 --> 00:15:07,320
going about their lives normally.

332
00:15:07,320 --> 00:15:09,320
Well, not really. A photograph doesn't

333
00:15:09,320 --> 00:15:11,320
tell the whole story.

334
00:15:11,320 --> 00:15:13,320
Sweden may have a more relaxed approach

335
00:15:13,320 --> 00:15:15,320
than countries like Britain and France,

336
00:15:15,320 --> 00:15:17,320
but life in Sweden over the last 11

337
00:15:17,320 --> 00:15:19,320
months has been anything but normal.

338
00:15:19,320 --> 00:15:21,320
As well as the voluntary

339
00:15:21,320 --> 00:15:23,320
guidelines, there are also restrictions

340
00:15:23,320 --> 00:15:25,320
mandated by law.

341
00:15:25,320 --> 00:15:27,320
Crowd sizes at public events

342
00:15:27,320 --> 00:15:29,320
were limited to 50 people,

343
00:15:29,320 --> 00:15:31,320
and as the virus got worse, that number

344
00:15:31,320 --> 00:15:33,320
was reduced to just eight.

345
00:15:33,320 --> 00:15:35,320
Restaurants and bars can only serve

346
00:15:35,320 --> 00:15:37,320
customers who are seated.

347
00:15:37,320 --> 00:15:39,320
Visits to nursing homes are restricted.

348
00:15:39,320 --> 00:15:41,320
There are travel restrictions from other

349
00:15:41,320 --> 00:15:43,320
countries. Twice, schools have

350
00:15:43,320 --> 00:15:45,320
switched to remote learning, and

351
00:15:45,320 --> 00:15:47,320
that's in addition to all the voluntary

352
00:15:47,320 --> 00:15:49,320
guidelines I just showed you regarding

353
00:15:49,320 --> 00:15:51,320
gatherings, social distancing, and

354
00:15:51,320 --> 00:15:53,320
staying home.

355
00:15:53,320 --> 00:15:55,320
A survey by Sweden's Civil Contingencies

356
00:15:55,320 --> 00:15:57,320
Agency suggests that

357
00:15:57,320 --> 00:15:59,320
87% of the population

358
00:15:59,320 --> 00:16:01,320
are continuing to follow social distancing

359
00:16:01,320 --> 00:16:03,320
recommendations, and domestic

360
00:16:03,320 --> 00:16:05,320
airlines are grounded.

361
00:16:05,320 --> 00:16:07,320
And according to Anders Tenjel,

362
00:16:07,320 --> 00:16:09,320
Swedes have only around 30%

363
00:16:09,320 --> 00:16:11,320
of the social interactions that

364
00:16:11,320 --> 00:16:13,320
they did prior to the pandemic.

365
00:16:13,320 --> 00:16:15,320
Sweden travelled a lot less than they

366
00:16:15,320 --> 00:16:17,320
usually do. They actually decreased their

367
00:16:17,320 --> 00:16:19,320
travel more than the travel was

368
00:16:19,320 --> 00:16:21,320
decreased in our Scandinavian

369
00:16:21,320 --> 00:16:23,320
neighbours.

370
00:16:23,320 --> 00:16:25,320
If you ask Swedes,

371
00:16:25,320 --> 00:16:27,320
80-90% of them say that

372
00:16:27,320 --> 00:16:29,320
their lives have been very much affected

373
00:16:29,320 --> 00:16:31,320
by the Covid-19. So

374
00:16:31,320 --> 00:16:33,320
I think you make a mistake if

375
00:16:33,320 --> 00:16:35,320
you think that the Swedish lockdown was

376
00:16:35,320 --> 00:16:37,320
less in place

377
00:16:37,320 --> 00:16:39,320
and was less effective than in many

378
00:16:39,320 --> 00:16:41,320
places just because it was a voluntary

379
00:16:41,320 --> 00:16:43,320
lockdown. So admire the Swedish

380
00:16:43,320 --> 00:16:45,320
model by all means, but let's

381
00:16:45,320 --> 00:16:47,320
not pretend that life in Sweden has

382
00:16:47,320 --> 00:16:49,320
gone on as normal. This is

383
00:16:49,320 --> 00:16:51,320
all far from normal.

384
00:16:51,320 --> 00:16:53,320
Sweden has reached herd immunity

385
00:16:53,320 --> 00:16:55,320
even as the United States

386
00:16:55,320 --> 00:16:57,320
panics. But Sweden is nowhere

387
00:16:57,320 --> 00:16:59,320
near reaching herd immunity.

388
00:16:59,320 --> 00:17:01,320
That's the problem with believing tabloid

389
00:17:01,320 --> 00:17:03,320
newspapers like the Daily Mail

390
00:17:03,320 --> 00:17:05,320
instead of listening to epidemiologists

391
00:17:05,320 --> 00:17:07,320
and checking the figures.

392
00:17:07,320 --> 00:17:09,320
Back in May, Professor Bjorn

393
00:17:09,320 --> 00:17:11,320
Olsson said herd immunity in

394
00:17:11,320 --> 00:17:13,320
Sweden is a long way off

395
00:17:13,320 --> 00:17:15,320
if we ever reach it. And in August

396
00:17:15,320 --> 00:17:17,320
he co-authored a study showing

397
00:17:17,320 --> 00:17:19,320
rates of infection way below the

398
00:17:19,320 --> 00:17:21,320
60-70% needed

399
00:17:21,320 --> 00:17:23,320
for herd immunity.

400
00:17:23,320 --> 00:17:25,320
As did a study commissioned by the

401
00:17:25,320 --> 00:17:27,320
Swedish Public Health Agency in May

402
00:17:27,320 --> 00:17:29,320
and a third study in December.

403
00:17:29,320 --> 00:17:31,320
And even the man

404
00:17:31,320 --> 00:17:33,320
every proponent of the Swedish model

405
00:17:33,320 --> 00:17:35,320
likes to quote, Anders Tegnell,

406
00:17:35,320 --> 00:17:37,320
said as late as November

407
00:17:37,320 --> 00:17:39,320
that the issue of herd immunity is

408
00:17:39,320 --> 00:17:41,320
difficult and there are no signs

409
00:17:41,320 --> 00:17:43,320
of immunity in the population that

410
00:17:43,320 --> 00:17:45,320
are slowing down the infection.

411
00:17:45,320 --> 00:17:47,320
In this graph you can see the difference

412
00:17:47,320 --> 00:17:49,320
between what's going on in Sweden

413
00:17:49,320 --> 00:17:51,320
with Dr Anders Tegnell

414
00:17:51,320 --> 00:17:53,320
versus the US with Dr Fauci.

415
00:17:53,320 --> 00:17:55,320
But of course the United States

416
00:17:55,320 --> 00:17:57,320
is doing even worse than Sweden.

417
00:17:57,320 --> 00:17:59,320
Anders Tegnell was put in charge

418
00:17:59,320 --> 00:18:01,320
of Sweden's pandemic policy

419
00:18:01,320 --> 00:18:03,320
while Anthony Fauci had no

420
00:18:03,320 --> 00:18:05,320
executive power at all.

421
00:18:05,320 --> 00:18:07,320
He could only advise a president

422
00:18:07,320 --> 00:18:09,320
who routinely ignored his advice.

423
00:18:09,320 --> 00:18:11,320
So while Sweden had a national

424
00:18:11,320 --> 00:18:13,320
plan led by an epidemiologist

425
00:18:13,320 --> 00:18:15,320
the United States had none

426
00:18:15,320 --> 00:18:17,320
led by a politician.

427
00:18:17,320 --> 00:18:19,320
And there are other differences.

428
00:18:19,320 --> 00:18:21,320
Sweden had a universal healthcare

429
00:18:21,320 --> 00:18:23,320
system which could cope with a

430
00:18:23,320 --> 00:18:25,320
pandemic and where everyone could get

431
00:18:25,320 --> 00:18:27,320
treated free of charge.

432
00:18:27,320 --> 00:18:29,320
Whether you think that's a good thing or a bad thing

433
00:18:29,320 --> 00:18:31,320
it's something the United States

434
00:18:31,320 --> 00:18:33,320
doesn't have.

435
00:18:33,320 --> 00:18:35,320
And unlike Sweden where few people go to church

436
00:18:35,320 --> 00:18:37,320
millions of Americans continued

437
00:18:37,320 --> 00:18:39,320
to pack places of worship.

438
00:18:39,320 --> 00:18:41,320
And Swedes are pretty healthy.

439
00:18:41,320 --> 00:18:43,320
Compare the level of diabetes

440
00:18:43,320 --> 00:18:45,320
in Sweden with that of the

441
00:18:45,320 --> 00:18:47,320
United States.

442
00:18:47,320 --> 00:18:49,320
This is the level of obesity in Sweden

443
00:18:49,320 --> 00:18:51,320
compared to the USA.

444
00:18:51,320 --> 00:18:53,320
And while most domestic

445
00:18:53,320 --> 00:18:55,320
flights in Sweden were grounded

446
00:18:55,320 --> 00:18:57,320
in the United States they continued

447
00:18:57,320 --> 00:18:59,320
flying. And most Swedes

448
00:18:59,320 --> 00:19:01,320
followed government guidelines and restrictions.

449
00:19:01,320 --> 00:19:03,320
In the United States these

450
00:19:03,320 --> 00:19:05,320
varied from state to state and

451
00:19:05,320 --> 00:19:07,320
were often ignored even by the

452
00:19:07,320 --> 00:19:09,320
leader of the country. And even

453
00:19:09,320 --> 00:19:11,320
by politicians urging others to follow

454
00:19:11,320 --> 00:19:13,320
the guidelines.

455
00:19:13,320 --> 00:19:15,320
So why would anyone be surprised that the

456
00:19:15,320 --> 00:19:17,320
American death toll was higher?

457
00:19:17,320 --> 00:19:19,320
To see how Sweden's been doing

458
00:19:19,320 --> 00:19:21,320
it's no good comparing it to countries with

459
00:19:21,320 --> 00:19:23,320
completely different population densities

460
00:19:23,320 --> 00:19:25,320
different obesity levels

461
00:19:25,320 --> 00:19:27,320
different healthcare systems and different

462
00:19:27,320 --> 00:19:29,320
cultures. You need to compare it with

463
00:19:29,320 --> 00:19:31,320
countries where all those things are similar.

464
00:19:31,320 --> 00:19:33,320
And that's not hard.

465
00:19:33,320 --> 00:19:35,320
Sweden's neighbours have very

466
00:19:35,320 --> 00:19:37,320
similar profiles in all those respects.

467
00:19:37,320 --> 00:19:39,320
The only significant differences

468
00:19:39,320 --> 00:19:41,320
were mandatory lockdowns

469
00:19:41,320 --> 00:19:43,320
versus voluntary lockdown

470
00:19:43,320 --> 00:19:45,320
and policies on mask wearing, test

471
00:19:45,320 --> 00:19:47,320
and trace.

472
00:19:47,320 --> 00:19:49,320
The result? At the time of writing

473
00:19:49,320 --> 00:19:51,320
Sweden has a mortality rate

474
00:19:51,320 --> 00:19:53,320
in other words the number of deaths per million people

475
00:19:53,320 --> 00:19:55,320
four times that of Denmark

476
00:19:55,320 --> 00:19:57,320
eight times that of Finland

477
00:19:57,320 --> 00:19:59,320
and ten times that of Norway.

478
00:19:59,320 --> 00:20:01,320
And now even mainstream

479
00:20:01,320 --> 00:20:03,320
media outlets like Newsweek

480
00:20:03,320 --> 00:20:05,320
are acknowledging the fact that they succeeded.

481
00:20:05,320 --> 00:20:07,320
Well that may be Newsweek's

482
00:20:07,320 --> 00:20:09,320
opinion, but opinion is not

483
00:20:09,320 --> 00:20:11,320
fact. If the United States

484
00:20:11,320 --> 00:20:13,320
had the same mortality rate as Sweden

485
00:20:13,320 --> 00:20:15,320
then instead of having 260,000

486
00:20:15,320 --> 00:20:17,320
deaths at the time of writing

487
00:20:17,320 --> 00:20:19,320
it would have had 210,000

488
00:20:19,320 --> 00:20:21,320
deaths.

489
00:20:21,320 --> 00:20:23,320
People can have their own opinions about whether

490
00:20:23,320 --> 00:20:25,320
that's a success, but they aren't

491
00:20:25,320 --> 00:20:27,320
entitled to change the facts to

492
00:20:27,320 --> 00:20:29,320
fit that opinion.

493
00:20:29,320 --> 00:20:31,320
So what's my opinion?

494
00:20:31,320 --> 00:20:33,320
Well of course the whole point of this channel is not

495
00:20:33,320 --> 00:20:35,320
to tell you what I think, but to

496
00:20:35,320 --> 00:20:37,320
fact check the claims of those who do

497
00:20:37,320 --> 00:20:39,320
give you their opinion and to present

498
00:20:39,320 --> 00:20:41,320
facts so you can form your own opinion.

499
00:20:41,320 --> 00:20:43,320
You just can't

500
00:20:43,320 --> 00:20:45,320
borrow someone else's opinion off the shelf

501
00:20:45,320 --> 00:20:47,320
or beat the drum for a team.

502
00:20:47,320 --> 00:20:49,320
You have to answer questions

503
00:20:49,320 --> 00:20:51,320
that are rather difficult to answer.

504
00:20:51,320 --> 00:20:53,320
For example, apart from the

505
00:20:53,320 --> 00:20:55,320
fatalities caused by COVID-19

506
00:20:55,320 --> 00:20:57,320
how do we assess the downside

507
00:20:57,320 --> 00:20:59,320
of millions of people who didn't die

508
00:20:59,320 --> 00:21:01,320
but continue to feel the effects?

509
00:21:01,320 --> 00:21:03,320
I also wanted to mention that 96%

510
00:21:03,320 --> 00:21:05,320
of people in California who get COVID

511
00:21:05,320 --> 00:21:07,320
recover with almost no significant

512
00:21:07,320 --> 00:21:09,320
sequelae, or no significant

513
00:21:09,320 --> 00:21:11,320
continuing medical

514
00:21:11,320 --> 00:21:13,320
problems. But where does that

515
00:21:13,320 --> 00:21:15,320
figure come from? That's the

516
00:21:15,320 --> 00:21:17,320
trouble with doing science by press conference.

517
00:21:17,320 --> 00:21:19,320
There's a tendency to dream up

518
00:21:19,320 --> 00:21:21,320
some figures on the back of an envelope

519
00:21:21,320 --> 00:21:23,320
and throw others out with a confident

520
00:21:23,320 --> 00:21:25,320
knowledge they can't be checked.

521
00:21:25,320 --> 00:21:27,320
Ericsson is saying that only

522
00:21:27,320 --> 00:21:29,320
about 4% of people suffer

523
00:21:29,320 --> 00:21:31,320
long-term effects from COVID-19.

524
00:21:31,320 --> 00:21:33,320
It's impossible to say if Ericsson

525
00:21:33,320 --> 00:21:35,320
got that figure from a reliable source

526
00:21:35,320 --> 00:21:37,320
or made a mistake, or found

527
00:21:37,320 --> 00:21:39,320
it in a blog, or simply made it

528
00:21:39,320 --> 00:21:41,320
up. All I can do is

529
00:21:41,320 --> 00:21:43,320
cite proper studies and real figures

530
00:21:43,320 --> 00:21:45,320
which do have sources you can

531
00:21:45,320 --> 00:21:47,320
check. For example, a British

532
00:21:47,320 --> 00:21:49,320
study found that 10% of people

533
00:21:49,320 --> 00:21:51,320
experience prolonged illness after

534
00:21:51,320 --> 00:21:53,320
COVID-19. A paper

535
00:21:53,320 --> 00:21:55,320
in the Journal of the American Medical Association

536
00:21:55,320 --> 00:21:57,320
found that 71% of

537
00:21:57,320 --> 00:21:59,320
COVID cases in Italy had

538
00:21:59,320 --> 00:22:01,320
symptoms during infection,

539
00:22:01,320 --> 00:22:03,320
and of those, 32%

540
00:22:03,320 --> 00:22:05,320
still had one or two symptoms two months

541
00:22:05,320 --> 00:22:07,320
later, and 44%

542
00:22:07,320 --> 00:22:09,320
had a worse quality of life.

543
00:22:09,320 --> 00:22:11,320
Another US study found that

544
00:22:11,320 --> 00:22:13,320
only 35% of people

545
00:22:13,320 --> 00:22:15,320
didn't return to their previous level of

546
00:22:15,320 --> 00:22:17,320
health two to three weeks after

547
00:22:17,320 --> 00:22:19,320
a positive test.

548
00:22:19,320 --> 00:22:21,320
It's known as long-COVID,

549
00:22:21,320 --> 00:22:23,320
the long-term health problems brought on

550
00:22:23,320 --> 00:22:25,320
by COVID-19.

551
00:22:25,320 --> 00:22:27,320
Symptoms range from fatigue and joint

552
00:22:27,320 --> 00:22:29,320
pain to chest pain and

553
00:22:29,320 --> 00:22:31,320
diarrhoea, and more seriously heart

554
00:22:31,320 --> 00:22:33,320
problems and breathing difficulties.

555
00:22:33,320 --> 00:22:35,320
I sympathise with people like

556
00:22:35,320 --> 00:22:37,320
the Bakersfield doctors whose businesses

557
00:22:37,320 --> 00:22:39,320
are suffering, but giving misinformation

558
00:22:39,320 --> 00:22:41,320
like that isn't helping.

559
00:22:41,320 --> 00:22:43,320
If we, as Tony Abbott

560
00:22:43,320 --> 00:22:45,320
suggested, let nature run its course

561
00:22:45,320 --> 00:22:47,320
and take no action to curb the virus,

562
00:22:47,320 --> 00:22:49,320
would these doctors be back in business

563
00:22:49,320 --> 00:22:51,320
or would patients be even

564
00:22:51,320 --> 00:22:53,320
less likely to visit their hospital?

565
00:22:53,320 --> 00:22:55,320
Would it make businesses

566
00:22:55,320 --> 00:22:57,320
like cafes, bars and movie theatres

567
00:22:57,320 --> 00:22:59,320
more popular, or would

568
00:22:59,320 --> 00:23:01,320
people be worried about an uncontrolled

569
00:23:01,320 --> 00:23:03,320
pandemic and stay away?

570
00:23:03,320 --> 00:23:05,320
In other words, would keeping

571
00:23:05,320 --> 00:23:07,320
everything open and letting

572
00:23:07,320 --> 00:23:09,320
the pandemic run its course

573
00:23:09,320 --> 00:23:11,320
result in better economic conditions

574
00:23:11,320 --> 00:23:13,320
or worse?

575
00:23:13,320 --> 00:23:15,320
And what about the people who work in these places

576
00:23:15,320 --> 00:23:17,320
and interact with a heavily infected

577
00:23:17,320 --> 00:23:19,320
public? Is it fair

578
00:23:19,320 --> 00:23:21,320
to ask them to risk their lives,

579
00:23:21,320 --> 00:23:23,320
and if they refuse, would it be fair

580
00:23:23,320 --> 00:23:25,320
to sack them? And if people

581
00:23:25,320 --> 00:23:27,320
were free to contract COVID, which

582
00:23:27,320 --> 00:23:29,320
is surely their right, is

583
00:23:29,320 --> 00:23:31,320
that fair on people they might

584
00:23:31,320 --> 00:23:33,320
infect, or on hospital staff who

585
00:23:33,320 --> 00:23:35,320
would then have to risk their lives treating

586
00:23:35,320 --> 00:23:37,320
these people? And how do

587
00:23:37,320 --> 00:23:39,320
we factor in the cost of lockdown

588
00:23:39,320 --> 00:23:41,320
in terms of mental health,

589
00:23:41,320 --> 00:23:43,320
educational setback, how do you

590
00:23:43,320 --> 00:23:45,320
assess that level of pain felt by

591
00:23:45,320 --> 00:23:47,320
millions of people under lockdown

592
00:23:47,320 --> 00:23:49,320
and then compare it to, say, the

593
00:23:49,320 --> 00:23:51,320
pain of losing a loved one or

594
00:23:51,320 --> 00:23:53,320
the suffering caused by long COVID?

595
00:23:53,320 --> 00:23:55,320
I know that borrowing

596
00:23:55,320 --> 00:23:57,320
an opinion off the shelf is very

597
00:23:57,320 --> 00:23:59,320
simple, quick and easy, and

598
00:23:59,320 --> 00:24:01,320
thinking about questions like these,

599
00:24:01,320 --> 00:24:03,320
weighing them in the balance and checking

600
00:24:03,320 --> 00:24:05,320
all the facts and figures is

601
00:24:05,320 --> 00:24:07,320
much harder work.

602
00:24:07,320 --> 00:24:09,320
But if you're going to voice an opinion and

603
00:24:09,320 --> 00:24:11,320
hold that opinion very firmly,

604
00:24:11,320 --> 00:24:13,320
then I hope you have weighed each of these

605
00:24:13,320 --> 00:24:15,320
questions carefully and are very

606
00:24:15,320 --> 00:24:17,320
sure of your answers.

607
00:24:37,320 --> 00:24:39,320
Thank you.
