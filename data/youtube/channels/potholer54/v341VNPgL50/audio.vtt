00:00.000 --> 00:05.140
Typically you quarantine the sick. When someone has measles you quarantine them.

00:05.140 --> 00:08.980
We've never seen where we quarantine the healthy.

00:08.980 --> 00:16.180
Actually we have. The word quarantine itself comes from the practice of locking down healthy people for 40 days.

00:16.180 --> 00:21.180
Quarantena, in old Italian, when ships arrived in Venice from areas of plague.

00:21.180 --> 00:26.180
In the 17th century the villagers of Iam in England, most of them healthy,

00:26.360 --> 00:31.360
locked themselves down when a few of their number caught bubonic plague.

00:31.360 --> 00:38.360
If you don't recognise this guy, he's Dan Erickson, one of two doctors who held a press conference back in April.

00:38.360 --> 00:42.360
They work for Accelerated Urgent Care in Bakersfield, California.

00:42.360 --> 00:45.360
They specialise in common ailments like these.

00:45.360 --> 00:53.360
And the reason for the press conference was to voice concern that their business was suffering because of Covid-19 restrictions.

00:53.540 --> 01:00.540
This has caused some severe disruption for Accelerated as we have people coming in seven in the morning till midnight

01:00.540 --> 01:08.540
or reporting to the health department or calling patients back and at the same time our volumes have dropped significantly.

01:08.540 --> 01:13.540
Now I'm not unsympathetic to opinions that lockdowns may be doing more harm than good.

01:13.540 --> 01:20.540
After all these doctors, like so many people running a business, have seen a sharp decline in income because of lockdowns.

01:20.720 --> 01:23.720
They also have an adverse effect on mental health.

01:23.720 --> 01:31.720
They increase domestic violence, economic hardship, infringe on civil liberty, raise unemployment and lower GDP.

01:31.720 --> 01:35.720
So I don't mind listening to arguments for and against.

01:35.720 --> 01:44.720
But I do mind when people try to support their case by misrepresenting scientific facts and figures and presenting bogus information.

01:44.720 --> 01:47.720
And that's what's happening here.

01:47.900 --> 01:53.900
They claimed that lockdown isn't necessary because they calculated, wrongly as it turns out,

01:53.900 --> 02:01.900
that the infection fatality rate of Covid-19 is only 0.03%, a third that of flu.

02:01.900 --> 02:04.900
That claim, of course, went viral.

02:04.900 --> 02:09.900
So let's go through their calculation and just buzz in when you spot the mistake.

02:10.080 --> 02:13.080
So if we look at California, these numbers are from yesterday.

02:13.080 --> 02:21.080
We have 33,865 Covid cases out of a total of 280,900 total tested.

02:21.080 --> 02:25.080
That's 12% of Californians were positive for Covid.

02:25.080 --> 02:28.080
Good use of the buzzer.

02:28.080 --> 02:29.080
And you're right.

02:29.080 --> 02:32.080
It's not 12% of Californians who were Covid positive.

02:32.080 --> 02:35.080
It's 12% of the people who got tested.

02:35.260 --> 02:39.260
And they obviously aren't representative of the population as a whole.

02:39.260 --> 02:46.260
Because before mass testing came in, people got tested because they had symptoms or were exposed to the virus

02:46.260 --> 02:49.260
or thought they might have been exposed to the virus.

02:49.260 --> 02:55.260
So there's going to be a much higher percentage of positive cases among those tested during the early weeks of the pandemic

02:55.260 --> 02:58.260
compared to the general population.

02:58.260 --> 03:02.260
It's like doing a survey of a waiting room at a Texas hospital

03:02.440 --> 03:06.440
and then discovering that a third of the people waiting are critically ill.

03:06.440 --> 03:11.440
You can't scale that up and assume that therefore a third of Texans must be critically ill.

03:11.440 --> 03:15.440
So the more you test, the more positives you get.

03:15.440 --> 03:18.440
But that's a classic case of mixing up measurements.

03:18.440 --> 03:22.440
You get more positive cases but the percentage of positive cases

03:22.440 --> 03:26.440
which is what the doctors are measuring for their calculation

03:26.440 --> 03:29.440
doesn't go up, it goes down.

03:29.620 --> 03:33.620
Even if the doctors don't understand the difference between a number and a percentage

03:33.620 --> 03:35.620
which I find hard to believe

03:35.620 --> 03:38.620
all they have to do is look at the data they claim to be using.

03:38.620 --> 03:42.620
As testing expanded to the California population as a whole

03:42.620 --> 03:45.620
shown by the light brown bars on this graph

03:45.620 --> 03:50.620
the number of positive cases went up, shown by the darker brown at the bottom.

03:50.620 --> 03:54.620
But the percentage of positive cases went down

03:54.620 --> 03:58.620
shown by the blue line with the percentage scale on the right hand side.

03:58.800 --> 04:01.800
A month after the doctors held their press conference

04:01.800 --> 04:03.800
far more people were being tested

04:03.800 --> 04:09.800
and of course the positivity rate was down from 12% to around 4.5%.

04:09.800 --> 04:13.800
The doctors' analysis was so bad and so amateurish

04:13.800 --> 04:16.800
that the American College of Emergency Physicians

04:16.800 --> 04:19.800
and the American Academy of Emergency Medicine

04:19.800 --> 04:23.800
took the extraordinary step of issuing a joint statement disowning it.

04:23.980 --> 04:27.980
They called the doctors' claims reckless and untested musings.

04:29.980 --> 04:33.980
I got interested in this topic when someone posted this on the forum

04:33.980 --> 04:35.980
and it seems to be a view that's widely shared.

04:35.980 --> 04:38.980
Listening to the science didn't work out so well

04:38.980 --> 04:41.980
seven months later and a global recession

04:41.980 --> 04:44.980
even Fauci now says on a recent 60 Minutes

04:44.980 --> 04:48.980
he would not shut down the economy when faced with a similar virus.

04:48.980 --> 04:51.980
Actually that's not what Fauci said

04:52.160 --> 04:56.160
but I'm more interested in the idea that listening to the science isn't a good idea.

04:56.160 --> 05:00.160
Because science can't tell you whether lockdowns are the right policy

05:00.160 --> 05:04.160
that's a personal opinion and ultimately a political decision.

05:04.160 --> 05:09.160
All it can tell you is what the epidemiological effects of a lockdown will be

05:09.160 --> 05:13.160
the reproduction rate of the virus, the number of infections

05:13.160 --> 05:17.160
and roughly how many people would die over what period of time.

05:17.160 --> 05:21.160
That's why listening to the science always works out well

05:21.340 --> 05:25.340
because it ensures that when a government weighs the pros and cons of lockdown

05:25.340 --> 05:28.340
it does so on the basis of facts and figures

05:28.340 --> 05:32.340
rather than ideological dogma, blind guesses and wishful thinking.

05:32.340 --> 05:36.340
So what do real scientific studies say about lockdowns?

05:36.340 --> 05:40.340
Lockdown has become a catch-all word to describe

05:40.340 --> 05:43.340
restricted movements, limits on social gatherings

05:43.340 --> 05:45.340
and the closure of certain businesses.

05:45.340 --> 05:49.340
Sometimes the rules are tightened, sometimes they're relaxed

05:49.520 --> 05:53.520
depending on whether the number of cases is rising or falling.

05:53.520 --> 05:59.520
Scientific studies refer to these as restrictions or non-pharmaceutical interventions.

05:59.520 --> 06:00.520
What about Sweden?

06:00.520 --> 06:02.520
Sweden, Sweden, Sweden, Sweden.

06:02.520 --> 06:05.520
Hold on, I'm going to look at Sweden in a minute.

06:05.520 --> 06:09.520
A lot of posters on my channel suggested I take a look at the claims of Ivor Cummins

06:09.520 --> 06:13.520
an Irish biochemical engineer who runs a YouTube channel.

06:13.520 --> 06:17.520
Unlike the Bakersfield doctors, he actually cites scientific studies

06:17.700 --> 06:19.700
which is commendable.

06:19.700 --> 06:23.700
We now have many, many publications, including Lancet

06:23.700 --> 06:27.700
that show clearly, based on the data, that lockdown

06:27.700 --> 06:31.700
barely or does not affect deaths per million outcomes.

06:31.700 --> 06:35.700
Well here's the first one on the list and the one Cummins highlights.

06:35.700 --> 06:40.700
It wasn't published in The Lancet, which is one of the world's top two medical journals

06:40.700 --> 06:43.700
it was published in eClinical Medicine

06:43.700 --> 06:46.700
a separate open access journal owned by The Lancet.

06:46.880 --> 06:50.880
Nevertheless, it concluded that lockdowns don't affect mortality rates

06:50.880 --> 06:53.880
which is supportive of Cummins' claims.

06:53.880 --> 06:55.880
But here's the problem.

06:55.880 --> 06:58.880
When I look for other studies in Lancet-owned journals

06:58.880 --> 07:00.880
and in The Lancet itself

07:00.880 --> 07:03.880
they all reach the opposite conclusion.

07:03.880 --> 07:07.880
They all concluded that lockdowns reduced rates of infection.

07:07.880 --> 07:10.880
Some showed that the stricter lockdown measures were

07:10.880 --> 07:12.880
the more effective they were

07:12.880 --> 07:15.880
and they showed that when the strictest lockdown measures were lifted

07:16.060 --> 07:19.060
infection rates began to rise again.

07:19.060 --> 07:23.060
Picking one study from The Lancet group that supports your case

07:23.060 --> 07:25.060
and ignoring all the others that don't

07:25.060 --> 07:27.060
is called cherry picking

07:27.060 --> 07:30.060
and it's a familiar tactic on social media.

07:30.060 --> 07:34.060
So then I moved on to the second paper on Cummins' list

07:34.060 --> 07:38.060
which was published by a very reputable journal, Science.

07:38.060 --> 07:41.060
It's a shame that Cummins doesn't show the paper

07:41.060 --> 07:43.060
and give a proper citation or link

07:43.060 --> 07:45.060
so that people can read it for themselves.

07:45.240 --> 07:49.240
I could only find the study by doing a search of Google Scholar

07:49.240 --> 07:52.240
using the part of the title that Cummins showed.

07:52.240 --> 07:54.240
It's a paper by Denning et al.

07:54.240 --> 07:56.240
But when I clicked on the link

07:56.240 --> 07:59.240
it turns out that the title of the paper has changed.

07:59.240 --> 08:01.240
According to Cummins, the paper claimed

08:01.240 --> 08:03.240
lockdown had only a minor effect.

08:03.240 --> 08:05.240
In fact, their study

08:05.240 --> 08:07.240
which looked at lockdowns in Germany

08:07.240 --> 08:10.240
found a clear reduction of the spreading rate

08:10.240 --> 08:12.240
related to each governmental intervention.

08:12.240 --> 08:14.240
And it concluded

08:14.420 --> 08:17.420
results suggest that the full extent of government interventions

08:17.420 --> 08:20.420
was necessary to stop exponential growth.

08:20.420 --> 08:23.420
Then I checked the third citation in the list

08:23.420 --> 08:25.420
which turns out to be ambiguous.

08:25.420 --> 08:28.420
There's no such thing as the Koch Institute.

08:28.420 --> 08:31.420
There's the Robert Koch Institute in Germany

08:31.420 --> 08:33.420
a respected government medical agency

08:33.420 --> 08:36.420
that advises on responses to the pandemic.

08:36.420 --> 08:38.420
And there's the Charles Koch Institute

08:38.420 --> 08:40.420
in the United States

08:40.420 --> 08:42.420
an American lobby group that gives frequent opinions

08:42.600 --> 08:44.600
and conclusions on the pandemic

08:44.600 --> 08:46.600
from a political perspective.

08:46.600 --> 08:48.600
If Cummins is citing

08:48.600 --> 08:50.600
the political lobby group

08:50.600 --> 08:52.600
Charles Koch, then its opinions

08:52.600 --> 08:54.600
about the reproduction rate

08:54.600 --> 08:57.600
are irrelevant because it isn't a scientific body.

08:57.600 --> 08:59.600
If Cummins is citing

08:59.600 --> 09:01.600
the scientific institute

09:01.600 --> 09:03.600
the Robert Koch Institute

09:03.600 --> 09:06.600
it's stated very clearly that lockdowns are effective.

09:06.600 --> 09:08.600
In this bulletin

09:08.600 --> 09:10.600
the RKI says

09:10.780 --> 09:12.780
Oh, sorry.

09:12.780 --> 09:14.780
Isolation measures

09:14.780 --> 09:16.780
of confirmed cases and the quarantining

09:16.780 --> 09:18.780
of contact persons lead not only

09:18.780 --> 09:20.780
to a reduction in the number of secondary cases

09:20.780 --> 09:22.780
but also to a shortening of

09:22.780 --> 09:24.780
the generation time.

09:24.780 --> 09:26.780
The RKI even did a review of studies

09:26.780 --> 09:28.780
that looked at the effect of restrictions

09:28.780 --> 09:30.780
and interventions.

09:30.780 --> 09:32.780
It listed the conclusions of each one.

09:32.780 --> 09:34.780
The vast majority

09:34.780 --> 09:36.780
found that restrictions slowed the

09:36.780 --> 09:38.780
reproduction rate of the virus

09:38.960 --> 09:40.960
and reduced the number of cases

09:40.960 --> 09:42.960
or both.

09:42.960 --> 09:44.960
If you want to check them for yourselves

09:44.960 --> 09:46.960
the review is linked in the video description.

09:46.960 --> 09:48.960
Based on this thorough review

09:48.960 --> 09:50.960
of the scientific literature

09:50.960 --> 09:52.960
the RKI doesn't conclude

09:52.960 --> 09:54.960
that lockdowns are ineffective

09:54.960 --> 09:56.960
it says the complete opposite.

09:56.960 --> 09:58.960
In our analysis we find

09:58.960 --> 10:00.960
a strong dose response effect

10:00.960 --> 10:02.960
of restrictions on gatherings

10:02.960 --> 10:04.960
the requirement to wear masks

10:04.960 --> 10:06.960
and the closings of workplaces and schools

10:07.140 --> 10:09.140
and both of the COVID-19 pandemic.

10:09.140 --> 10:11.140
I'm not going to go through the list

10:11.140 --> 10:13.140
and track down every blog article

10:13.140 --> 10:15.140
and study.

10:15.140 --> 10:17.140
That's something Cummins should have done

10:17.140 --> 10:19.140
before he posted it.

10:19.140 --> 10:21.140
But at number 17 I did spot one that I'd already read

10:21.140 --> 10:23.140
in the British Medical Journal

10:23.140 --> 10:25.140
so I knew that Cummins had misrepresented

10:25.140 --> 10:27.140
that one too.

10:27.140 --> 10:29.140
It's not a scientific study

10:29.140 --> 10:31.140
it's a non peer reviewed news article

10:31.140 --> 10:33.140
looking at why Belarus had so few deaths

10:33.140 --> 10:35.140
due to COVID-19.

10:35.320 --> 10:37.320
The likely explanations

10:37.320 --> 10:39.320
the article reports are a high

10:39.320 --> 10:41.320
proportion of hospital beds per thousand

10:41.320 --> 10:43.320
population, 40 times

10:43.320 --> 10:45.320
that of the UK, and a

10:45.320 --> 10:47.320
structural bias towards dealing with

10:47.320 --> 10:49.320
pandemics and mass testing

10:49.320 --> 10:51.320
and very few care homes

10:51.320 --> 10:53.320
and the relative isolation

10:53.320 --> 10:55.320
of the country that means borders

10:55.320 --> 10:57.320
could be easily closed and

10:57.320 --> 10:59.320
travellers monitored.

10:59.320 --> 11:01.320
And finally because Belarus is a dictatorship

11:01.320 --> 11:03.320
where the figures may have been

11:03.320 --> 11:05.320
fudged anyway, some experts

11:05.320 --> 11:07.320
fear that many coronavirus

11:07.320 --> 11:09.320
related deaths are registered

11:09.320 --> 11:11.320
as cases of pneumonia.

11:11.320 --> 11:13.320
Most importantly even if it

11:13.320 --> 11:15.320
had been a scientific study

11:15.320 --> 11:17.320
the article made no conclusion about

11:17.320 --> 11:19.320
the effectiveness of lockdown

11:19.320 --> 11:21.320
and nothing in the article that suggests

11:21.320 --> 11:23.320
lockdowns are ineffective.

11:23.320 --> 11:25.320
So just like numbers two and three

11:25.320 --> 11:27.320
what on earth is it doing on

11:27.320 --> 11:29.320
Cummins' list?

11:29.320 --> 11:31.320
He needs to check all these supposed sources

11:31.320 --> 11:33.320
read them properly, make sure

11:33.320 --> 11:35.320
they're peer reviewed scientific studies and

11:35.320 --> 11:37.320
not newspaper stories or political

11:37.320 --> 11:39.320
blogs, pick out the ones that really

11:39.320 --> 11:41.320
do show that lockdowns are ineffective

11:41.320 --> 11:43.320
and then repost an accurate

11:43.320 --> 11:45.320
list.

11:45.320 --> 11:47.320
If you don't cherry pick and misread

11:47.320 --> 11:49.320
what real scientific studies

11:49.320 --> 11:51.320
show is that lockdowns are effective.

11:51.320 --> 11:53.320
It doesn't mean they're a good

11:53.320 --> 11:55.320
idea, it just means that

11:55.320 --> 11:57.320
they are effective in reducing the spread

11:57.320 --> 11:59.320
of an infectious disease.

11:59.320 --> 12:01.320
That's been known since 14th century

12:01.320 --> 12:03.320
Venice and it's pretty obvious

12:03.320 --> 12:05.320
why. So all other things

12:05.320 --> 12:07.320
being equal the strictest lockdown

12:07.320 --> 12:09.320
measures, which most countries

12:09.320 --> 12:11.320
do when the R8 gets dangerously high

12:11.320 --> 12:13.320
ought to result in a reduction of

12:13.320 --> 12:15.320
Covid-19 cases after

12:15.320 --> 12:17.320
about 10 to 14 days.

12:17.320 --> 12:19.320
And that's exactly what we see.

12:19.320 --> 12:21.320
What about Sweden? Sweden. Sweden.

12:21.320 --> 12:23.320
Sweden. Sweden. Alright, so what

12:23.320 --> 12:25.320
about Sweden? Sweden never

12:25.320 --> 12:27.320
locked down, never mandated masks

12:27.320 --> 12:29.320
never closed their borders,

12:29.320 --> 12:31.320
never closed their under-16 schools,

12:31.320 --> 12:33.320
never closed the restaurants

12:33.320 --> 12:35.320
and bars and did everything they could

12:35.320 --> 12:37.320
to avoid trampling on human rights.

12:37.320 --> 12:39.320
Sweden took an approach based

12:39.320 --> 12:41.320
on science. Well, Tony Heller

12:41.320 --> 12:43.320
did get one thing right. Sweden

12:43.320 --> 12:45.320
took an approach based on science,

12:45.320 --> 12:47.320
just like most countries with a couple

12:47.320 --> 12:49.320
of obvious exceptions.

12:49.320 --> 12:51.320
Swedish epidemiologists know as well

12:51.320 --> 12:53.320
as American or British epidemiologists

12:53.320 --> 12:55.320
that eliminating mass gatherings

12:55.320 --> 12:57.320
and restricting movement

12:57.320 --> 12:59.320
slow the spread of the virus,

12:59.320 --> 13:01.320
including the architect of the Swedish

13:01.320 --> 13:03.320
model Anders Tegnell.

13:03.320 --> 13:05.320
He says people who claim Sweden

13:05.320 --> 13:07.320
didn't have restrictions are

13:07.320 --> 13:09.320
wrong. You're saying

13:09.320 --> 13:11.320
that the strategy here, apart from the face mask

13:11.320 --> 13:13.320
is pretty much the same as everywhere else, is that?

13:13.320 --> 13:15.320
To a great extent, yes.

13:15.320 --> 13:17.320
I mean, we also slow down many

13:17.320 --> 13:19.320
things.

13:19.320 --> 13:21.320
The

13:21.320 --> 13:23.320
domestic air flights

13:23.320 --> 13:25.320
in Sweden were slowed down to

13:25.320 --> 13:27.320
basically nothing. There was no domestic

13:27.320 --> 13:29.320
flights in Sweden anymore.

13:29.320 --> 13:31.320
This was due to people stopped travelling, not because

13:31.320 --> 13:33.320
we made it mandatory for the flights to stop.

13:33.320 --> 13:35.320
Trains were also cut down

13:35.320 --> 13:37.320
quite a lot, so

13:37.320 --> 13:39.320
the society really slowed down

13:39.320 --> 13:41.320
quite a lot also in Sweden.

13:41.320 --> 13:43.320
I think much more than many people in other countries

13:43.320 --> 13:45.320
understand. The reason Tegnell

13:45.320 --> 13:47.320
thought a voluntary system would work

13:47.320 --> 13:49.320
is that Sweden has a number of advantages

13:49.320 --> 13:51.320
over countries outside

13:51.320 --> 13:53.320
of Scandinavia.

13:53.320 --> 13:55.320
For one thing, it has a modern universal

13:55.320 --> 13:57.320
healthcare system that the authorities

13:57.320 --> 13:59.320
calculated had enough ICU

13:59.320 --> 14:01.320
beds to cope with a high number

14:01.320 --> 14:03.320
of COVID cases and treat

14:03.320 --> 14:05.320
them effectively. Secondly,

14:05.320 --> 14:07.320
most Swedes live alone,

14:07.320 --> 14:09.320
and the country isn't a major tourist destination

14:09.320 --> 14:11.320
or a travel crossroads,

14:11.320 --> 14:13.320
so it would be less vulnerable to a rapid

14:13.320 --> 14:15.320
spread of the virus.

14:15.320 --> 14:17.320
Sweden isn't a particularly religious

14:17.320 --> 14:19.320
country, so you don't see many

14:19.320 --> 14:21.320
mass gatherings in churches or mosques.

14:21.320 --> 14:23.320
And most importantly,

14:23.320 --> 14:25.320
imposing rules is probably not

14:25.320 --> 14:27.320
even necessary. After all,

14:27.320 --> 14:29.320
this is the nation that gave us ABBA

14:29.320 --> 14:31.320
and Volvo's. Swedes don't

14:31.320 --> 14:33.320
go around raping and pillaging anymore.

14:33.320 --> 14:35.320
They're a pretty sensible, responsible

14:35.320 --> 14:37.320
people who for the most part follow

14:37.320 --> 14:39.320
government advice.

14:39.320 --> 14:41.320
Isn't that a little racist?

14:41.320 --> 14:43.320
If I like their race,

14:43.320 --> 14:45.320
how can that be racist?

14:45.320 --> 14:47.320
So the authorities opted for guidelines

14:47.320 --> 14:49.320
like these rather than legally

14:49.320 --> 14:51.320
enforced rules. Refrain

14:51.320 --> 14:53.320
from unnecessary journeys,

14:53.320 --> 14:55.320
avoid public transport, don't go

14:55.320 --> 14:57.320
to meetings and concerts, and so on.

14:57.320 --> 14:59.320
Life looks pretty good in Sweden.

14:59.320 --> 15:01.320
Things are open, their schools

15:01.320 --> 15:03.320
are open, their universities are

15:03.320 --> 15:05.320
open. People in Sweden are

15:05.320 --> 15:07.320
going about their lives normally.

15:07.320 --> 15:09.320
Well, not really. A photograph doesn't

15:09.320 --> 15:11.320
tell the whole story.

15:11.320 --> 15:13.320
Sweden may have a more relaxed approach

15:13.320 --> 15:15.320
than countries like Britain and France,

15:15.320 --> 15:17.320
but life in Sweden over the last 11

15:17.320 --> 15:19.320
months has been anything but normal.

15:19.320 --> 15:21.320
As well as the voluntary

15:21.320 --> 15:23.320
guidelines, there are also restrictions

15:23.320 --> 15:25.320
mandated by law.

15:25.320 --> 15:27.320
Crowd sizes at public events

15:27.320 --> 15:29.320
were limited to 50 people,

15:29.320 --> 15:31.320
and as the virus got worse, that number

15:31.320 --> 15:33.320
was reduced to just eight.

15:33.320 --> 15:35.320
Restaurants and bars can only serve

15:35.320 --> 15:37.320
customers who are seated.

15:37.320 --> 15:39.320
Visits to nursing homes are restricted.

15:39.320 --> 15:41.320
There are travel restrictions from other

15:41.320 --> 15:43.320
countries. Twice, schools have

15:43.320 --> 15:45.320
switched to remote learning, and

15:45.320 --> 15:47.320
that's in addition to all the voluntary

15:47.320 --> 15:49.320
guidelines I just showed you regarding

15:49.320 --> 15:51.320
gatherings, social distancing, and

15:51.320 --> 15:53.320
staying home.

15:53.320 --> 15:55.320
A survey by Sweden's Civil Contingencies

15:55.320 --> 15:57.320
Agency suggests that

15:57.320 --> 15:59.320
87% of the population

15:59.320 --> 16:01.320
are continuing to follow social distancing

16:01.320 --> 16:03.320
recommendations, and domestic

16:03.320 --> 16:05.320
airlines are grounded.

16:05.320 --> 16:07.320
And according to Anders Tenjel,

16:07.320 --> 16:09.320
Swedes have only around 30%

16:09.320 --> 16:11.320
of the social interactions that

16:11.320 --> 16:13.320
they did prior to the pandemic.

16:13.320 --> 16:15.320
Sweden travelled a lot less than they

16:15.320 --> 16:17.320
usually do. They actually decreased their

16:17.320 --> 16:19.320
travel more than the travel was

16:19.320 --> 16:21.320
decreased in our Scandinavian

16:21.320 --> 16:23.320
neighbours.

16:23.320 --> 16:25.320
If you ask Swedes,

16:25.320 --> 16:27.320
80-90% of them say that

16:27.320 --> 16:29.320
their lives have been very much affected

16:29.320 --> 16:31.320
by the Covid-19. So

16:31.320 --> 16:33.320
I think you make a mistake if

16:33.320 --> 16:35.320
you think that the Swedish lockdown was

16:35.320 --> 16:37.320
less in place

16:37.320 --> 16:39.320
and was less effective than in many

16:39.320 --> 16:41.320
places just because it was a voluntary

16:41.320 --> 16:43.320
lockdown. So admire the Swedish

16:43.320 --> 16:45.320
model by all means, but let's

16:45.320 --> 16:47.320
not pretend that life in Sweden has

16:47.320 --> 16:49.320
gone on as normal. This is

16:49.320 --> 16:51.320
all far from normal.

16:51.320 --> 16:53.320
Sweden has reached herd immunity

16:53.320 --> 16:55.320
even as the United States

16:55.320 --> 16:57.320
panics. But Sweden is nowhere

16:57.320 --> 16:59.320
near reaching herd immunity.

16:59.320 --> 17:01.320
That's the problem with believing tabloid

17:01.320 --> 17:03.320
newspapers like the Daily Mail

17:03.320 --> 17:05.320
instead of listening to epidemiologists

17:05.320 --> 17:07.320
and checking the figures.

17:07.320 --> 17:09.320
Back in May, Professor Bjorn

17:09.320 --> 17:11.320
Olsson said herd immunity in

17:11.320 --> 17:13.320
Sweden is a long way off

17:13.320 --> 17:15.320
if we ever reach it. And in August

17:15.320 --> 17:17.320
he co-authored a study showing

17:17.320 --> 17:19.320
rates of infection way below the

17:19.320 --> 17:21.320
60-70% needed

17:21.320 --> 17:23.320
for herd immunity.

17:23.320 --> 17:25.320
As did a study commissioned by the

17:25.320 --> 17:27.320
Swedish Public Health Agency in May

17:27.320 --> 17:29.320
and a third study in December.

17:29.320 --> 17:31.320
And even the man

17:31.320 --> 17:33.320
every proponent of the Swedish model

17:33.320 --> 17:35.320
likes to quote, Anders Tegnell,

17:35.320 --> 17:37.320
said as late as November

17:37.320 --> 17:39.320
that the issue of herd immunity is

17:39.320 --> 17:41.320
difficult and there are no signs

17:41.320 --> 17:43.320
of immunity in the population that

17:43.320 --> 17:45.320
are slowing down the infection.

17:45.320 --> 17:47.320
In this graph you can see the difference

17:47.320 --> 17:49.320
between what's going on in Sweden

17:49.320 --> 17:51.320
with Dr Anders Tegnell

17:51.320 --> 17:53.320
versus the US with Dr Fauci.

17:53.320 --> 17:55.320
But of course the United States

17:55.320 --> 17:57.320
is doing even worse than Sweden.

17:57.320 --> 17:59.320
Anders Tegnell was put in charge

17:59.320 --> 18:01.320
of Sweden's pandemic policy

18:01.320 --> 18:03.320
while Anthony Fauci had no

18:03.320 --> 18:05.320
executive power at all.

18:05.320 --> 18:07.320
He could only advise a president

18:07.320 --> 18:09.320
who routinely ignored his advice.

18:09.320 --> 18:11.320
So while Sweden had a national

18:11.320 --> 18:13.320
plan led by an epidemiologist

18:13.320 --> 18:15.320
the United States had none

18:15.320 --> 18:17.320
led by a politician.

18:17.320 --> 18:19.320
And there are other differences.

18:19.320 --> 18:21.320
Sweden had a universal healthcare

18:21.320 --> 18:23.320
system which could cope with a

18:23.320 --> 18:25.320
pandemic and where everyone could get

18:25.320 --> 18:27.320
treated free of charge.

18:27.320 --> 18:29.320
Whether you think that's a good thing or a bad thing

18:29.320 --> 18:31.320
it's something the United States

18:31.320 --> 18:33.320
doesn't have.

18:33.320 --> 18:35.320
And unlike Sweden where few people go to church

18:35.320 --> 18:37.320
millions of Americans continued

18:37.320 --> 18:39.320
to pack places of worship.

18:39.320 --> 18:41.320
And Swedes are pretty healthy.

18:41.320 --> 18:43.320
Compare the level of diabetes

18:43.320 --> 18:45.320
in Sweden with that of the

18:45.320 --> 18:47.320
United States.

18:47.320 --> 18:49.320
This is the level of obesity in Sweden

18:49.320 --> 18:51.320
compared to the USA.

18:51.320 --> 18:53.320
And while most domestic

18:53.320 --> 18:55.320
flights in Sweden were grounded

18:55.320 --> 18:57.320
in the United States they continued

18:57.320 --> 18:59.320
flying. And most Swedes

18:59.320 --> 19:01.320
followed government guidelines and restrictions.

19:01.320 --> 19:03.320
In the United States these

19:03.320 --> 19:05.320
varied from state to state and

19:05.320 --> 19:07.320
were often ignored even by the

19:07.320 --> 19:09.320
leader of the country. And even

19:09.320 --> 19:11.320
by politicians urging others to follow

19:11.320 --> 19:13.320
the guidelines.

19:13.320 --> 19:15.320
So why would anyone be surprised that the

19:15.320 --> 19:17.320
American death toll was higher?

19:17.320 --> 19:19.320
To see how Sweden's been doing

19:19.320 --> 19:21.320
it's no good comparing it to countries with

19:21.320 --> 19:23.320
completely different population densities

19:23.320 --> 19:25.320
different obesity levels

19:25.320 --> 19:27.320
different healthcare systems and different

19:27.320 --> 19:29.320
cultures. You need to compare it with

19:29.320 --> 19:31.320
countries where all those things are similar.

19:31.320 --> 19:33.320
And that's not hard.

19:33.320 --> 19:35.320
Sweden's neighbours have very

19:35.320 --> 19:37.320
similar profiles in all those respects.

19:37.320 --> 19:39.320
The only significant differences

19:39.320 --> 19:41.320
were mandatory lockdowns

19:41.320 --> 19:43.320
versus voluntary lockdown

19:43.320 --> 19:45.320
and policies on mask wearing, test

19:45.320 --> 19:47.320
and trace.

19:47.320 --> 19:49.320
The result? At the time of writing

19:49.320 --> 19:51.320
Sweden has a mortality rate

19:51.320 --> 19:53.320
in other words the number of deaths per million people

19:53.320 --> 19:55.320
four times that of Denmark

19:55.320 --> 19:57.320
eight times that of Finland

19:57.320 --> 19:59.320
and ten times that of Norway.

19:59.320 --> 20:01.320
And now even mainstream

20:01.320 --> 20:03.320
media outlets like Newsweek

20:03.320 --> 20:05.320
are acknowledging the fact that they succeeded.

20:05.320 --> 20:07.320
Well that may be Newsweek's

20:07.320 --> 20:09.320
opinion, but opinion is not

20:09.320 --> 20:11.320
fact. If the United States

20:11.320 --> 20:13.320
had the same mortality rate as Sweden

20:13.320 --> 20:15.320
then instead of having 260,000

20:15.320 --> 20:17.320
deaths at the time of writing

20:17.320 --> 20:19.320
it would have had 210,000

20:19.320 --> 20:21.320
deaths.

20:21.320 --> 20:23.320
People can have their own opinions about whether

20:23.320 --> 20:25.320
that's a success, but they aren't

20:25.320 --> 20:27.320
entitled to change the facts to

20:27.320 --> 20:29.320
fit that opinion.

20:29.320 --> 20:31.320
So what's my opinion?

20:31.320 --> 20:33.320
Well of course the whole point of this channel is not

20:33.320 --> 20:35.320
to tell you what I think, but to

20:35.320 --> 20:37.320
fact check the claims of those who do

20:37.320 --> 20:39.320
give you their opinion and to present

20:39.320 --> 20:41.320
facts so you can form your own opinion.

20:41.320 --> 20:43.320
You just can't

20:43.320 --> 20:45.320
borrow someone else's opinion off the shelf

20:45.320 --> 20:47.320
or beat the drum for a team.

20:47.320 --> 20:49.320
You have to answer questions

20:49.320 --> 20:51.320
that are rather difficult to answer.

20:51.320 --> 20:53.320
For example, apart from the

20:53.320 --> 20:55.320
fatalities caused by COVID-19

20:55.320 --> 20:57.320
how do we assess the downside

20:57.320 --> 20:59.320
of millions of people who didn't die

20:59.320 --> 21:01.320
but continue to feel the effects?

21:01.320 --> 21:03.320
I also wanted to mention that 96%

21:03.320 --> 21:05.320
of people in California who get COVID

21:05.320 --> 21:07.320
recover with almost no significant

21:07.320 --> 21:09.320
sequelae, or no significant

21:09.320 --> 21:11.320
continuing medical

21:11.320 --> 21:13.320
problems. But where does that

21:13.320 --> 21:15.320
figure come from? That's the

21:15.320 --> 21:17.320
trouble with doing science by press conference.

21:17.320 --> 21:19.320
There's a tendency to dream up

21:19.320 --> 21:21.320
some figures on the back of an envelope

21:21.320 --> 21:23.320
and throw others out with a confident

21:23.320 --> 21:25.320
knowledge they can't be checked.

21:25.320 --> 21:27.320
Ericsson is saying that only

21:27.320 --> 21:29.320
about 4% of people suffer

21:29.320 --> 21:31.320
long-term effects from COVID-19.

21:31.320 --> 21:33.320
It's impossible to say if Ericsson

21:33.320 --> 21:35.320
got that figure from a reliable source

21:35.320 --> 21:37.320
or made a mistake, or found

21:37.320 --> 21:39.320
it in a blog, or simply made it

21:39.320 --> 21:41.320
up. All I can do is

21:41.320 --> 21:43.320
cite proper studies and real figures

21:43.320 --> 21:45.320
which do have sources you can

21:45.320 --> 21:47.320
check. For example, a British

21:47.320 --> 21:49.320
study found that 10% of people

21:49.320 --> 21:51.320
experience prolonged illness after

21:51.320 --> 21:53.320
COVID-19. A paper

21:53.320 --> 21:55.320
in the Journal of the American Medical Association

21:55.320 --> 21:57.320
found that 71% of

21:57.320 --> 21:59.320
COVID cases in Italy had

21:59.320 --> 22:01.320
symptoms during infection,

22:01.320 --> 22:03.320
and of those, 32%

22:03.320 --> 22:05.320
still had one or two symptoms two months

22:05.320 --> 22:07.320
later, and 44%

22:07.320 --> 22:09.320
had a worse quality of life.

22:09.320 --> 22:11.320
Another US study found that

22:11.320 --> 22:13.320
only 35% of people

22:13.320 --> 22:15.320
didn't return to their previous level of

22:15.320 --> 22:17.320
health two to three weeks after

22:17.320 --> 22:19.320
a positive test.

22:19.320 --> 22:21.320
It's known as long-COVID,

22:21.320 --> 22:23.320
the long-term health problems brought on

22:23.320 --> 22:25.320
by COVID-19.

22:25.320 --> 22:27.320
Symptoms range from fatigue and joint

22:27.320 --> 22:29.320
pain to chest pain and

22:29.320 --> 22:31.320
diarrhoea, and more seriously heart

22:31.320 --> 22:33.320
problems and breathing difficulties.

22:33.320 --> 22:35.320
I sympathise with people like

22:35.320 --> 22:37.320
the Bakersfield doctors whose businesses

22:37.320 --> 22:39.320
are suffering, but giving misinformation

22:39.320 --> 22:41.320
like that isn't helping.

22:41.320 --> 22:43.320
If we, as Tony Abbott

22:43.320 --> 22:45.320
suggested, let nature run its course

22:45.320 --> 22:47.320
and take no action to curb the virus,

22:47.320 --> 22:49.320
would these doctors be back in business

22:49.320 --> 22:51.320
or would patients be even

22:51.320 --> 22:53.320
less likely to visit their hospital?

22:53.320 --> 22:55.320
Would it make businesses

22:55.320 --> 22:57.320
like cafes, bars and movie theatres

22:57.320 --> 22:59.320
more popular, or would

22:59.320 --> 23:01.320
people be worried about an uncontrolled

23:01.320 --> 23:03.320
pandemic and stay away?

23:03.320 --> 23:05.320
In other words, would keeping

23:05.320 --> 23:07.320
everything open and letting

23:07.320 --> 23:09.320
the pandemic run its course

23:09.320 --> 23:11.320
result in better economic conditions

23:11.320 --> 23:13.320
or worse?

23:13.320 --> 23:15.320
And what about the people who work in these places

23:15.320 --> 23:17.320
and interact with a heavily infected

23:17.320 --> 23:19.320
public? Is it fair

23:19.320 --> 23:21.320
to ask them to risk their lives,

23:21.320 --> 23:23.320
and if they refuse, would it be fair

23:23.320 --> 23:25.320
to sack them? And if people

23:25.320 --> 23:27.320
were free to contract COVID, which

23:27.320 --> 23:29.320
is surely their right, is

23:29.320 --> 23:31.320
that fair on people they might

23:31.320 --> 23:33.320
infect, or on hospital staff who

23:33.320 --> 23:35.320
would then have to risk their lives treating

23:35.320 --> 23:37.320
these people? And how do

23:37.320 --> 23:39.320
we factor in the cost of lockdown

23:39.320 --> 23:41.320
in terms of mental health,

23:41.320 --> 23:43.320
educational setback, how do you

23:43.320 --> 23:45.320
assess that level of pain felt by

23:45.320 --> 23:47.320
millions of people under lockdown

23:47.320 --> 23:49.320
and then compare it to, say, the

23:49.320 --> 23:51.320
pain of losing a loved one or

23:51.320 --> 23:53.320
the suffering caused by long COVID?

23:53.320 --> 23:55.320
I know that borrowing

23:55.320 --> 23:57.320
an opinion off the shelf is very

23:57.320 --> 23:59.320
simple, quick and easy, and

23:59.320 --> 24:01.320
thinking about questions like these,

24:01.320 --> 24:03.320
weighing them in the balance and checking

24:03.320 --> 24:05.320
all the facts and figures is

24:05.320 --> 24:07.320
much harder work.

24:07.320 --> 24:09.320
But if you're going to voice an opinion and

24:09.320 --> 24:11.320
hold that opinion very firmly,

24:11.320 --> 24:13.320
then I hope you have weighed each of these

24:13.320 --> 24:15.320
questions carefully and are very

24:15.320 --> 24:17.320
sure of your answers.

24:37.320 --> 24:39.320
Thank you.
