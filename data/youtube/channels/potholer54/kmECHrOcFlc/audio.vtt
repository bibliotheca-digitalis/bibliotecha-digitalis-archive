00:00.000 --> 00:06.560
The movie The Day After Tomorrow is based very loosely on a hypothesis that increased

00:06.560 --> 00:11.240
global warming will trigger another ice age. It's a theme that's also been taken up by

00:11.240 --> 00:16.560
the media. But in this video, as always, I want to look at the science and compare it

00:16.560 --> 00:18.180
to the hype.

00:18.180 --> 00:22.720
So let's start with Wally Broecker, who postulated that increasing meltwater flowing south from

00:22.720 --> 00:27.080
Greenland would interrupt the Gulf Stream. That's the current that brings warm water

00:27.080 --> 00:32.600
up from the Caribbean to the North Atlantic, and most climatologists agree, keeps Western

00:32.600 --> 00:34.720
Europe warm in winter.

00:34.720 --> 00:39.640
Normally the Gulf Stream gets more salty as water evaporates on the journey northwards.

00:39.640 --> 00:44.400
Since salty water is dense, it sinks in the North Atlantic, forming a deep-sea current

00:44.400 --> 00:49.680
that makes the return journey southwards. This is known as the Atlantic Meridional Overturning

00:49.680 --> 00:54.940
Circulation, or AMOC, which is part of a much larger thermohaline circulation extending

00:54.940 --> 00:56.720
around the world.

00:56.720 --> 01:01.720
And meltwater from Greenland is fresh water. If that mixes with the Gulf Stream, then the

01:01.720 --> 01:07.720
salt content is diluted and the water no longer sinks. The result would be a slowdown or even

01:07.720 --> 01:14.220
a shutdown of the AMOC. Western Europe would experience the same kinds of winters as Canada.

01:14.220 --> 01:19.480
Evidence from the past supports the idea because the same thing has happened several times.

01:19.480 --> 01:23.960
Most recently, at the end of the last glaciation, the probable cause of what's known as the

01:23.960 --> 01:29.200
Younger Dryas was a huge lake of melted ice in North America that burst its banks and

01:29.200 --> 01:34.480
spilled into the Atlantic. Oceanographers say it's likely increasing amounts of meltwater

01:34.480 --> 01:40.140
will begin to slow down the ocean's circulation system, but not in the next few decades. It'll

01:40.140 --> 01:44.680
take at least 100 years for there to be enough meltwater to do that.

01:44.680 --> 01:50.320
Even so, they began to monitor the strength of the Atlantic circulation. In 2005, researchers

01:50.320 --> 01:55.360
at the National Oceanography Centre in Britain surveyed the Atlantic and compared their findings

01:55.360 --> 02:00.960
with records going back to 1957. Now, the figures had to be extrapolated because previous

02:00.960 --> 02:05.920
surveys had recorded different criteria, but the results suggested that the deep current

02:05.920 --> 02:12.600
taking cold water south had slowed 30%. The tabloid press, of course, immediately hyped

02:12.600 --> 02:13.600
the story.

02:13.600 --> 02:17.920
Is Britain on the brink of a new ice age? asked one British newspaper.

02:17.920 --> 02:22.360
The body of the story answered the question unequivocally, as the Gulf Stream that warms

02:22.360 --> 02:28.160
our shores falters was the first line. The story went on. This week's news that the Gulf

02:28.160 --> 02:33.160
Stream has abruptly begun to weaken could be one of the most important and most devastating

02:33.160 --> 02:39.440
scientific observations ever to hit the headlines. Researchers at the National Oceanography Centre

02:39.440 --> 02:44.240
in Southampton, who have measured the strength of the current far out into the Atlantic,

02:44.240 --> 02:49.880
have found that it has slowed by a massive 30%. But there was no data to show whether

02:49.880 --> 02:56.000
the slowdown, even if it was real, was anything abnormal or permanent. Science is sceptical

02:56.000 --> 03:01.240
by nature. Most scientists don't jump to conclusions, especially based on just one

03:01.240 --> 03:07.340
inconclusive study. realclimate.org, a blog run by climate scientists, warned that while

03:07.340 --> 03:12.320
continued monitoring of this key climatic area is clearly warranted, the imminent chilling

03:12.320 --> 03:17.400
of Europe is a ways off yet. Gavin Schmidt, a climate modeller at the Goddard Institute

03:17.400 --> 03:22.440
for Space Studies, and Richard Woods, chief oceanographer at the Hadley Centre in Britain,

03:22.440 --> 03:26.720
both said the same thing, that a decline in circulation should have produced a decline

03:26.720 --> 03:32.400
in European surface temperatures, but it hadn't. So it's likely that even the result itself

03:32.400 --> 03:37.560
was erroneous. Robert Dixon of the British Centre for Environment, Fisheries and Aquaculture

03:37.560 --> 03:41.900
Science told the New York Times that much more data was needed to determine whether

03:41.900 --> 03:48.200
a slowdown was underway. Even Harry Brydon, lead author of the study, was cautious about

03:48.200 --> 03:53.180
his own results. He told news scientists he wasn't yet sure if the change was temporary

03:53.180 --> 03:59.660
or signals a long-term trend. But caution and caveats are not what sell news stories.

03:59.660 --> 04:04.260
Critics of the anthropogenic climate change theory often accuse the media of alarmism,

04:04.260 --> 04:09.140
and this is a prime example. When Brydon and his colleagues checked newly installed sensors

04:09.140 --> 04:14.340
a few months later as part of a follow-up study, the results were more ambiguous.

04:14.340 --> 04:18.740
We've got a variable signal, but it's too early to detect any trends, Brydon told news

04:18.740 --> 04:24.420
scientists, in a story titled No New Ice Age for Western Europe. You couldn't get a clearer

04:24.420 --> 04:30.780
headline than that. Carl Wunsch, an oceanographer at MIT, was quoted as saying, it's a complicated

04:30.780 --> 04:36.280
story reduced to a fairy tale. And yet the mainstream media was still fixated on the

04:36.280 --> 04:41.160
idea of an imminent shutdown. Sea change, why global warming could leave Brydon feeling

04:41.160 --> 04:46.480
the cold, was the headline in The Guardian. In 2007, the full results of the follow-up

04:46.480 --> 04:52.680
study were published. And it confirmed the preliminary 2006 results, showing a huge variation

04:52.680 --> 04:59.040
in the speed of the thermohaline circulation. Even if the 30% slowdown found in 2005 was

04:59.040 --> 05:03.880
real, it could easily be part of this natural variation, which is what prominent climate

05:03.880 --> 05:09.560
scientists had been saying all along. Then in March 2010, researchers from NASA's Jet

05:09.560 --> 05:15.640
Propulsion Laboratory used other data to measure the circulation, including satellite altimetry,

05:15.640 --> 05:22.560
and found no significant change between 2002 and 2009. So the Daily Mail fearlessly busted

05:22.560 --> 05:29.560
the media's Ice Age fearmongering. New climate change myth! Gulf Stream is not slowing down.

05:30.080 --> 05:33.860
Fears that global warming will shut down the Gulf Stream and plunge Britain into a mini

05:33.860 --> 05:39.920
Ice Age are unfounded, a study shows. Some environmentalists have argued that global

05:39.920 --> 05:44.680
warming could shut off the stream, sending temperatures spiralling down across Europe

05:44.680 --> 05:49.680
as they rise elsewhere. Hang on, it was the media that was telling us that global warming

05:49.680 --> 05:54.200
would shut off the Gulf Stream, and they didn't get that from environmentalists. If the Daily

05:54.200 --> 05:58.760
Mail wants to name and shame those who created the myth, it should start with this piece

05:58.760 --> 06:05.760
of hysterical nonsense from 2005. Okay, who printed it? Why, shock horror, it was the

06:06.760 --> 06:12.520
Daily Mail. Obviously, in its outrage that we'd all been hoodwinked by yet another myth,

06:12.520 --> 06:16.800
the Mail forgot that it had helped start the myth five years earlier with this kind of

06:16.800 --> 06:22.760
scaremongering rubbish. Without the Gulf Stream, Britain would be scarcely habitable, its broad

06:22.760 --> 06:29.200
acres would turn to tundra, and winter temperatures would plunge to minus 20 degrees centigrade.

06:29.200 --> 06:33.720
The Daily Mail could easily have checked with climate scientists to see if this was at all

06:33.720 --> 06:38.720
likely. It could have read the science media, which managed to get the story right. Instead,

06:38.720 --> 06:43.600
it drew its own conclusions based on a limited understanding of the scientific method and

06:43.600 --> 06:48.560
ramped up the hype. It is hard to imagine the devastating effect such a climatic flip

06:48.560 --> 06:53.920
would have on our tightly populated islands, and on the world as a whole. Civilization

06:53.920 --> 06:59.600
could scarcely survive it. Now, five years on, the Daily Mail is railing against a myth

06:59.600 --> 07:04.540
of its own making. The idea that a slowdown of the ocean currents would trigger such a

07:04.540 --> 07:11.540
rapid change in climate is pure fantasy, explained Dr Willis. Well, yes. But four years earlier,

07:11.800 --> 07:16.320
Carl Wunsch had told news scientists exactly the same thing, except he had called it a

07:16.360 --> 07:21.680
fairy tale. Where was the Daily Mail then? I guess reporters were too busy having one

07:21.680 --> 07:27.560
last shag in anticipation that civilization was about to end. The Daily Mail wasn't the

07:27.560 --> 07:32.560
only one to help create a myth, then turn around five years later to disown it, and

07:32.560 --> 07:37.240
have the Schutzpah to blame someone else. Britain's Daily Telegraph also went overboard

07:37.240 --> 07:42.800
on Brydon's 2005 study. The discovery has alarmed scientists because ancient climate

07:42.800 --> 07:47.560
records show that northern air temperatures can drop by up to 10 degrees centigrade within

07:47.560 --> 07:53.620
decades of the circulation slowing, or even stopping. But despite quoting two experts

07:53.620 --> 07:58.560
in the story, the Telegraph failed to find a single one who said he was alarmed. The

07:58.560 --> 08:03.640
alarm seemed to be sounded by the Telegraph itself. The changes in the Atlantic currents

08:03.640 --> 08:08.560
would cause average temperatures over Britain to fall by up to 6 degrees centigrade in as

08:08.560 --> 08:14.280
little as 20 years. No prizes for guessing the Telegraph's stance five years on, when

08:14.280 --> 08:19.500
it had to report that scientists were not predicting any such thing. Research suggests

08:19.500 --> 08:25.960
that fears that Britain could be plunged into an ice age by a waning Gulf Stream are unfounded.

08:25.960 --> 08:30.960
The findings call into question theories proposed by some environmentalists that global warming

08:30.960 --> 08:36.880
could shut down the stream, causing temperatures to fall dramatically in Europe. But this theory

08:36.880 --> 08:41.520
isn't proposed by some environmentalists. The Telegraph based its story on a study by

08:41.520 --> 08:46.700
the Oceanography Centre, which it didn't understand, and then added its own speculation

08:46.700 --> 08:52.480
based on a poor understanding of climate science. Broca's theory, actually a hypothesis, has

08:52.480 --> 08:57.400
remained unchanged and unchallenged throughout this saga, and it doesn't say we're about

08:57.400 --> 09:03.000
to be plunged into another ice age. The smokescreen and spin put out by some of the media, whether

09:03.000 --> 09:07.760
they're hyping the science or trying to undermine it, make it harder and harder to get across

09:07.760 --> 09:13.440
the reality that's turning up in the research. Oceanographers say a slowdown of the thermohaline

09:13.440 --> 09:19.140
circulation is at least 100 years away, although that depends on the Greenland ice sheet continuing

09:19.140 --> 09:24.880
to melt at the current rate. Many glaciologists say it's likely to accelerate. Even if and

09:24.880 --> 09:29.300
when it happens, not one of the models predicts what the Daily Mail and the Daily Telegraph

09:29.300 --> 09:35.760
call an ice age. You know, Britain scarcely habitable, civilisation scarcely surviving

09:35.760 --> 09:41.840
it. Oceanographers say the world isn't facing the same situation it did 12,500 years ago,

09:41.840 --> 09:46.520
when it was coming out of a glaciation and global temperatures were much cooler. So even

09:46.520 --> 09:50.900
if and when a slowdown happens, the Mail's prediction that another ice age would cover

09:50.900 --> 09:55.960
Britain in permanently frozen soil is nothing more than tabloid journalists drawing their

09:55.960 --> 10:02.580
own conclusions. Does all this sound familiar? The 1970s myth about an imminent ice age was

10:02.580 --> 10:07.540
also largely the work of the media, for which scientists are now getting the blame. How

10:07.540 --> 10:12.500
long do you think before people are proclaiming the Daily Mail a champion of truth for busting

10:12.500 --> 10:15.580
a myth that those fraudulent scientists started?
