0	6560	The movie The Day After Tomorrow is based very loosely on a hypothesis that increased
6560	11240	global warming will trigger another ice age. It's a theme that's also been taken up by
11240	16560	the media. But in this video, as always, I want to look at the science and compare it
16560	18180	to the hype.
18180	22720	So let's start with Wally Broecker, who postulated that increasing meltwater flowing south from
22720	27080	Greenland would interrupt the Gulf Stream. That's the current that brings warm water
27080	32600	up from the Caribbean to the North Atlantic, and most climatologists agree, keeps Western
32600	34720	Europe warm in winter.
34720	39640	Normally the Gulf Stream gets more salty as water evaporates on the journey northwards.
39640	44400	Since salty water is dense, it sinks in the North Atlantic, forming a deep-sea current
44400	49680	that makes the return journey southwards. This is known as the Atlantic Meridional Overturning
49680	54940	Circulation, or AMOC, which is part of a much larger thermohaline circulation extending
54940	56720	around the world.
56720	61720	And meltwater from Greenland is fresh water. If that mixes with the Gulf Stream, then the
61720	67720	salt content is diluted and the water no longer sinks. The result would be a slowdown or even
67720	74220	a shutdown of the AMOC. Western Europe would experience the same kinds of winters as Canada.
74220	79480	Evidence from the past supports the idea because the same thing has happened several times.
79480	83960	Most recently, at the end of the last glaciation, the probable cause of what's known as the
83960	89200	Younger Dryas was a huge lake of melted ice in North America that burst its banks and
89200	94480	spilled into the Atlantic. Oceanographers say it's likely increasing amounts of meltwater
94480	100140	will begin to slow down the ocean's circulation system, but not in the next few decades. It'll
100140	104680	take at least 100 years for there to be enough meltwater to do that.
104680	110320	Even so, they began to monitor the strength of the Atlantic circulation. In 2005, researchers
110320	115360	at the National Oceanography Centre in Britain surveyed the Atlantic and compared their findings
115360	120960	with records going back to 1957. Now, the figures had to be extrapolated because previous
120960	125920	surveys had recorded different criteria, but the results suggested that the deep current
125920	132600	taking cold water south had slowed 30%. The tabloid press, of course, immediately hyped
132600	133600	the story.
133600	137920	Is Britain on the brink of a new ice age? asked one British newspaper.
137920	142360	The body of the story answered the question unequivocally, as the Gulf Stream that warms
142360	148160	our shores falters was the first line. The story went on. This week's news that the Gulf
148160	153160	Stream has abruptly begun to weaken could be one of the most important and most devastating
153160	159440	scientific observations ever to hit the headlines. Researchers at the National Oceanography Centre
159440	164240	in Southampton, who have measured the strength of the current far out into the Atlantic,
164240	169880	have found that it has slowed by a massive 30%. But there was no data to show whether
169880	176000	the slowdown, even if it was real, was anything abnormal or permanent. Science is sceptical
176000	181240	by nature. Most scientists don't jump to conclusions, especially based on just one
181240	187340	inconclusive study. realclimate.org, a blog run by climate scientists, warned that while
187340	192320	continued monitoring of this key climatic area is clearly warranted, the imminent chilling
192320	197400	of Europe is a ways off yet. Gavin Schmidt, a climate modeller at the Goddard Institute
197400	202440	for Space Studies, and Richard Woods, chief oceanographer at the Hadley Centre in Britain,
202440	206720	both said the same thing, that a decline in circulation should have produced a decline
206720	212400	in European surface temperatures, but it hadn't. So it's likely that even the result itself
212400	217560	was erroneous. Robert Dixon of the British Centre for Environment, Fisheries and Aquaculture
217560	221900	Science told the New York Times that much more data was needed to determine whether
221900	228200	a slowdown was underway. Even Harry Brydon, lead author of the study, was cautious about
228200	233180	his own results. He told news scientists he wasn't yet sure if the change was temporary
233180	239660	or signals a long-term trend. But caution and caveats are not what sell news stories.
239660	244260	Critics of the anthropogenic climate change theory often accuse the media of alarmism,
244260	249140	and this is a prime example. When Brydon and his colleagues checked newly installed sensors
249140	254340	a few months later as part of a follow-up study, the results were more ambiguous.
254340	258740	We've got a variable signal, but it's too early to detect any trends, Brydon told news
258740	264420	scientists, in a story titled No New Ice Age for Western Europe. You couldn't get a clearer
264420	270780	headline than that. Carl Wunsch, an oceanographer at MIT, was quoted as saying, it's a complicated
270780	276280	story reduced to a fairy tale. And yet the mainstream media was still fixated on the
276280	281160	idea of an imminent shutdown. Sea change, why global warming could leave Brydon feeling
281160	286480	the cold, was the headline in The Guardian. In 2007, the full results of the follow-up
286480	292680	study were published. And it confirmed the preliminary 2006 results, showing a huge variation
292680	299040	in the speed of the thermohaline circulation. Even if the 30% slowdown found in 2005 was
299040	303880	real, it could easily be part of this natural variation, which is what prominent climate
303880	309560	scientists had been saying all along. Then in March 2010, researchers from NASA's Jet
309560	315640	Propulsion Laboratory used other data to measure the circulation, including satellite altimetry,
315640	322560	and found no significant change between 2002 and 2009. So the Daily Mail fearlessly busted
322560	329560	the media's Ice Age fearmongering. New climate change myth! Gulf Stream is not slowing down.
330080	333860	Fears that global warming will shut down the Gulf Stream and plunge Britain into a mini
333860	339920	Ice Age are unfounded, a study shows. Some environmentalists have argued that global
339920	344680	warming could shut off the stream, sending temperatures spiralling down across Europe
344680	349680	as they rise elsewhere. Hang on, it was the media that was telling us that global warming
349680	354200	would shut off the Gulf Stream, and they didn't get that from environmentalists. If the Daily
354200	358760	Mail wants to name and shame those who created the myth, it should start with this piece
358760	365760	of hysterical nonsense from 2005. Okay, who printed it? Why, shock horror, it was the
366760	372520	Daily Mail. Obviously, in its outrage that we'd all been hoodwinked by yet another myth,
372520	376800	the Mail forgot that it had helped start the myth five years earlier with this kind of
376800	382760	scaremongering rubbish. Without the Gulf Stream, Britain would be scarcely habitable, its broad
382760	389200	acres would turn to tundra, and winter temperatures would plunge to minus 20 degrees centigrade.
389200	393720	The Daily Mail could easily have checked with climate scientists to see if this was at all
393720	398720	likely. It could have read the science media, which managed to get the story right. Instead,
398720	403600	it drew its own conclusions based on a limited understanding of the scientific method and
403600	408560	ramped up the hype. It is hard to imagine the devastating effect such a climatic flip
408560	413920	would have on our tightly populated islands, and on the world as a whole. Civilization
413920	419600	could scarcely survive it. Now, five years on, the Daily Mail is railing against a myth
419600	424540	of its own making. The idea that a slowdown of the ocean currents would trigger such a
424540	431540	rapid change in climate is pure fantasy, explained Dr Willis. Well, yes. But four years earlier,
431800	436320	Carl Wunsch had told news scientists exactly the same thing, except he had called it a
436360	441680	fairy tale. Where was the Daily Mail then? I guess reporters were too busy having one
441680	447560	last shag in anticipation that civilization was about to end. The Daily Mail wasn't the
447560	452560	only one to help create a myth, then turn around five years later to disown it, and
452560	457240	have the Schutzpah to blame someone else. Britain's Daily Telegraph also went overboard
457240	462800	on Brydon's 2005 study. The discovery has alarmed scientists because ancient climate
462800	467560	records show that northern air temperatures can drop by up to 10 degrees centigrade within
467560	473620	decades of the circulation slowing, or even stopping. But despite quoting two experts
473620	478560	in the story, the Telegraph failed to find a single one who said he was alarmed. The
478560	483640	alarm seemed to be sounded by the Telegraph itself. The changes in the Atlantic currents
483640	488560	would cause average temperatures over Britain to fall by up to 6 degrees centigrade in as
488560	494280	little as 20 years. No prizes for guessing the Telegraph's stance five years on, when
494280	499500	it had to report that scientists were not predicting any such thing. Research suggests
499500	505960	that fears that Britain could be plunged into an ice age by a waning Gulf Stream are unfounded.
505960	510960	The findings call into question theories proposed by some environmentalists that global warming
510960	516880	could shut down the stream, causing temperatures to fall dramatically in Europe. But this theory
516880	521520	isn't proposed by some environmentalists. The Telegraph based its story on a study by
521520	526700	the Oceanography Centre, which it didn't understand, and then added its own speculation
526700	532480	based on a poor understanding of climate science. Broca's theory, actually a hypothesis, has
532480	537400	remained unchanged and unchallenged throughout this saga, and it doesn't say we're about
537400	543000	to be plunged into another ice age. The smokescreen and spin put out by some of the media, whether
543000	547760	they're hyping the science or trying to undermine it, make it harder and harder to get across
547760	553440	the reality that's turning up in the research. Oceanographers say a slowdown of the thermohaline
553440	559140	circulation is at least 100 years away, although that depends on the Greenland ice sheet continuing
559140	564880	to melt at the current rate. Many glaciologists say it's likely to accelerate. Even if and
564880	569300	when it happens, not one of the models predicts what the Daily Mail and the Daily Telegraph
569300	575760	call an ice age. You know, Britain scarcely habitable, civilisation scarcely surviving
575760	581840	it. Oceanographers say the world isn't facing the same situation it did 12,500 years ago,
581840	586520	when it was coming out of a glaciation and global temperatures were much cooler. So even
586520	590900	if and when a slowdown happens, the Mail's prediction that another ice age would cover
590900	595960	Britain in permanently frozen soil is nothing more than tabloid journalists drawing their
595960	602580	own conclusions. Does all this sound familiar? The 1970s myth about an imminent ice age was
602580	607540	also largely the work of the media, for which scientists are now getting the blame. How
607540	612500	long do you think before people are proclaiming the Daily Mail a champion of truth for busting
612500	615580	a myth that those fraudulent scientists started?
