1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,560
The movie The Day After Tomorrow is based very loosely on a hypothesis that increased

2
00:00:06,560 --> 00:00:11,240
global warming will trigger another ice age. It's a theme that's also been taken up by

3
00:00:11,240 --> 00:00:16,560
the media. But in this video, as always, I want to look at the science and compare it

4
00:00:16,560 --> 00:00:18,180
to the hype.

5
00:00:18,180 --> 00:00:22,720
So let's start with Wally Broecker, who postulated that increasing meltwater flowing south from

6
00:00:22,720 --> 00:00:27,080
Greenland would interrupt the Gulf Stream. That's the current that brings warm water

7
00:00:27,080 --> 00:00:32,600
up from the Caribbean to the North Atlantic, and most climatologists agree, keeps Western

8
00:00:32,600 --> 00:00:34,720
Europe warm in winter.

9
00:00:34,720 --> 00:00:39,640
Normally the Gulf Stream gets more salty as water evaporates on the journey northwards.

10
00:00:39,640 --> 00:00:44,400
Since salty water is dense, it sinks in the North Atlantic, forming a deep-sea current

11
00:00:44,400 --> 00:00:49,680
that makes the return journey southwards. This is known as the Atlantic Meridional Overturning

12
00:00:49,680 --> 00:00:54,940
Circulation, or AMOC, which is part of a much larger thermohaline circulation extending

13
00:00:54,940 --> 00:00:56,720
around the world.

14
00:00:56,720 --> 00:01:01,720
And meltwater from Greenland is fresh water. If that mixes with the Gulf Stream, then the

15
00:01:01,720 --> 00:01:07,720
salt content is diluted and the water no longer sinks. The result would be a slowdown or even

16
00:01:07,720 --> 00:01:14,220
a shutdown of the AMOC. Western Europe would experience the same kinds of winters as Canada.

17
00:01:14,220 --> 00:01:19,480
Evidence from the past supports the idea because the same thing has happened several times.

18
00:01:19,480 --> 00:01:23,960
Most recently, at the end of the last glaciation, the probable cause of what's known as the

19
00:01:23,960 --> 00:01:29,200
Younger Dryas was a huge lake of melted ice in North America that burst its banks and

20
00:01:29,200 --> 00:01:34,480
spilled into the Atlantic. Oceanographers say it's likely increasing amounts of meltwater

21
00:01:34,480 --> 00:01:40,140
will begin to slow down the ocean's circulation system, but not in the next few decades. It'll

22
00:01:40,140 --> 00:01:44,680
take at least 100 years for there to be enough meltwater to do that.

23
00:01:44,680 --> 00:01:50,320
Even so, they began to monitor the strength of the Atlantic circulation. In 2005, researchers

24
00:01:50,320 --> 00:01:55,360
at the National Oceanography Centre in Britain surveyed the Atlantic and compared their findings

25
00:01:55,360 --> 00:02:00,960
with records going back to 1957. Now, the figures had to be extrapolated because previous

26
00:02:00,960 --> 00:02:05,920
surveys had recorded different criteria, but the results suggested that the deep current

27
00:02:05,920 --> 00:02:12,600
taking cold water south had slowed 30%. The tabloid press, of course, immediately hyped

28
00:02:12,600 --> 00:02:13,600
the story.

29
00:02:13,600 --> 00:02:17,920
Is Britain on the brink of a new ice age? asked one British newspaper.

30
00:02:17,920 --> 00:02:22,360
The body of the story answered the question unequivocally, as the Gulf Stream that warms

31
00:02:22,360 --> 00:02:28,160
our shores falters was the first line. The story went on. This week's news that the Gulf

32
00:02:28,160 --> 00:02:33,160
Stream has abruptly begun to weaken could be one of the most important and most devastating

33
00:02:33,160 --> 00:02:39,440
scientific observations ever to hit the headlines. Researchers at the National Oceanography Centre

34
00:02:39,440 --> 00:02:44,240
in Southampton, who have measured the strength of the current far out into the Atlantic,

35
00:02:44,240 --> 00:02:49,880
have found that it has slowed by a massive 30%. But there was no data to show whether

36
00:02:49,880 --> 00:02:56,000
the slowdown, even if it was real, was anything abnormal or permanent. Science is sceptical

37
00:02:56,000 --> 00:03:01,240
by nature. Most scientists don't jump to conclusions, especially based on just one

38
00:03:01,240 --> 00:03:07,340
inconclusive study. realclimate.org, a blog run by climate scientists, warned that while

39
00:03:07,340 --> 00:03:12,320
continued monitoring of this key climatic area is clearly warranted, the imminent chilling

40
00:03:12,320 --> 00:03:17,400
of Europe is a ways off yet. Gavin Schmidt, a climate modeller at the Goddard Institute

41
00:03:17,400 --> 00:03:22,440
for Space Studies, and Richard Woods, chief oceanographer at the Hadley Centre in Britain,

42
00:03:22,440 --> 00:03:26,720
both said the same thing, that a decline in circulation should have produced a decline

43
00:03:26,720 --> 00:03:32,400
in European surface temperatures, but it hadn't. So it's likely that even the result itself

44
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:37,560
was erroneous. Robert Dixon of the British Centre for Environment, Fisheries and Aquaculture

45
00:03:37,560 --> 00:03:41,900
Science told the New York Times that much more data was needed to determine whether

46
00:03:41,900 --> 00:03:48,200
a slowdown was underway. Even Harry Brydon, lead author of the study, was cautious about

47
00:03:48,200 --> 00:03:53,180
his own results. He told news scientists he wasn't yet sure if the change was temporary

48
00:03:53,180 --> 00:03:59,660
or signals a long-term trend. But caution and caveats are not what sell news stories.

49
00:03:59,660 --> 00:04:04,260
Critics of the anthropogenic climate change theory often accuse the media of alarmism,

50
00:04:04,260 --> 00:04:09,140
and this is a prime example. When Brydon and his colleagues checked newly installed sensors

51
00:04:09,140 --> 00:04:14,340
a few months later as part of a follow-up study, the results were more ambiguous.

52
00:04:14,340 --> 00:04:18,740
We've got a variable signal, but it's too early to detect any trends, Brydon told news

53
00:04:18,740 --> 00:04:24,420
scientists, in a story titled No New Ice Age for Western Europe. You couldn't get a clearer

54
00:04:24,420 --> 00:04:30,780
headline than that. Carl Wunsch, an oceanographer at MIT, was quoted as saying, it's a complicated

55
00:04:30,780 --> 00:04:36,280
story reduced to a fairy tale. And yet the mainstream media was still fixated on the

56
00:04:36,280 --> 00:04:41,160
idea of an imminent shutdown. Sea change, why global warming could leave Brydon feeling

57
00:04:41,160 --> 00:04:46,480
the cold, was the headline in The Guardian. In 2007, the full results of the follow-up

58
00:04:46,480 --> 00:04:52,680
study were published. And it confirmed the preliminary 2006 results, showing a huge variation

59
00:04:52,680 --> 00:04:59,040
in the speed of the thermohaline circulation. Even if the 30% slowdown found in 2005 was

60
00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:03,880
real, it could easily be part of this natural variation, which is what prominent climate

61
00:05:03,880 --> 00:05:09,560
scientists had been saying all along. Then in March 2010, researchers from NASA's Jet

62
00:05:09,560 --> 00:05:15,640
Propulsion Laboratory used other data to measure the circulation, including satellite altimetry,

63
00:05:15,640 --> 00:05:22,560
and found no significant change between 2002 and 2009. So the Daily Mail fearlessly busted

64
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:29,560
the media's Ice Age fearmongering. New climate change myth! Gulf Stream is not slowing down.

65
00:05:30,080 --> 00:05:33,860
Fears that global warming will shut down the Gulf Stream and plunge Britain into a mini

66
00:05:33,860 --> 00:05:39,920
Ice Age are unfounded, a study shows. Some environmentalists have argued that global

67
00:05:39,920 --> 00:05:44,680
warming could shut off the stream, sending temperatures spiralling down across Europe

68
00:05:44,680 --> 00:05:49,680
as they rise elsewhere. Hang on, it was the media that was telling us that global warming

69
00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:54,200
would shut off the Gulf Stream, and they didn't get that from environmentalists. If the Daily

70
00:05:54,200 --> 00:05:58,760
Mail wants to name and shame those who created the myth, it should start with this piece

71
00:05:58,760 --> 00:06:05,760
of hysterical nonsense from 2005. Okay, who printed it? Why, shock horror, it was the

72
00:06:06,760 --> 00:06:12,520
Daily Mail. Obviously, in its outrage that we'd all been hoodwinked by yet another myth,

73
00:06:12,520 --> 00:06:16,800
the Mail forgot that it had helped start the myth five years earlier with this kind of

74
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:22,760
scaremongering rubbish. Without the Gulf Stream, Britain would be scarcely habitable, its broad

75
00:06:22,760 --> 00:06:29,200
acres would turn to tundra, and winter temperatures would plunge to minus 20 degrees centigrade.

76
00:06:29,200 --> 00:06:33,720
The Daily Mail could easily have checked with climate scientists to see if this was at all

77
00:06:33,720 --> 00:06:38,720
likely. It could have read the science media, which managed to get the story right. Instead,

78
00:06:38,720 --> 00:06:43,600
it drew its own conclusions based on a limited understanding of the scientific method and

79
00:06:43,600 --> 00:06:48,560
ramped up the hype. It is hard to imagine the devastating effect such a climatic flip

80
00:06:48,560 --> 00:06:53,920
would have on our tightly populated islands, and on the world as a whole. Civilization

81
00:06:53,920 --> 00:06:59,600
could scarcely survive it. Now, five years on, the Daily Mail is railing against a myth

82
00:06:59,600 --> 00:07:04,540
of its own making. The idea that a slowdown of the ocean currents would trigger such a

83
00:07:04,540 --> 00:07:11,540
rapid change in climate is pure fantasy, explained Dr Willis. Well, yes. But four years earlier,

84
00:07:11,800 --> 00:07:16,320
Carl Wunsch had told news scientists exactly the same thing, except he had called it a

85
00:07:16,360 --> 00:07:21,680
fairy tale. Where was the Daily Mail then? I guess reporters were too busy having one

86
00:07:21,680 --> 00:07:27,560
last shag in anticipation that civilization was about to end. The Daily Mail wasn't the

87
00:07:27,560 --> 00:07:32,560
only one to help create a myth, then turn around five years later to disown it, and

88
00:07:32,560 --> 00:07:37,240
have the Schutzpah to blame someone else. Britain's Daily Telegraph also went overboard

89
00:07:37,240 --> 00:07:42,800
on Brydon's 2005 study. The discovery has alarmed scientists because ancient climate

90
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:47,560
records show that northern air temperatures can drop by up to 10 degrees centigrade within

91
00:07:47,560 --> 00:07:53,620
decades of the circulation slowing, or even stopping. But despite quoting two experts

92
00:07:53,620 --> 00:07:58,560
in the story, the Telegraph failed to find a single one who said he was alarmed. The

93
00:07:58,560 --> 00:08:03,640
alarm seemed to be sounded by the Telegraph itself. The changes in the Atlantic currents

94
00:08:03,640 --> 00:08:08,560
would cause average temperatures over Britain to fall by up to 6 degrees centigrade in as

95
00:08:08,560 --> 00:08:14,280
little as 20 years. No prizes for guessing the Telegraph's stance five years on, when

96
00:08:14,280 --> 00:08:19,500
it had to report that scientists were not predicting any such thing. Research suggests

97
00:08:19,500 --> 00:08:25,960
that fears that Britain could be plunged into an ice age by a waning Gulf Stream are unfounded.

98
00:08:25,960 --> 00:08:30,960
The findings call into question theories proposed by some environmentalists that global warming

99
00:08:30,960 --> 00:08:36,880
could shut down the stream, causing temperatures to fall dramatically in Europe. But this theory

100
00:08:36,880 --> 00:08:41,520
isn't proposed by some environmentalists. The Telegraph based its story on a study by

101
00:08:41,520 --> 00:08:46,700
the Oceanography Centre, which it didn't understand, and then added its own speculation

102
00:08:46,700 --> 00:08:52,480
based on a poor understanding of climate science. Broca's theory, actually a hypothesis, has

103
00:08:52,480 --> 00:08:57,400
remained unchanged and unchallenged throughout this saga, and it doesn't say we're about

104
00:08:57,400 --> 00:09:03,000
to be plunged into another ice age. The smokescreen and spin put out by some of the media, whether

105
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:07,760
they're hyping the science or trying to undermine it, make it harder and harder to get across

106
00:09:07,760 --> 00:09:13,440
the reality that's turning up in the research. Oceanographers say a slowdown of the thermohaline

107
00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:19,140
circulation is at least 100 years away, although that depends on the Greenland ice sheet continuing

108
00:09:19,140 --> 00:09:24,880
to melt at the current rate. Many glaciologists say it's likely to accelerate. Even if and

109
00:09:24,880 --> 00:09:29,300
when it happens, not one of the models predicts what the Daily Mail and the Daily Telegraph

110
00:09:29,300 --> 00:09:35,760
call an ice age. You know, Britain scarcely habitable, civilisation scarcely surviving

111
00:09:35,760 --> 00:09:41,840
it. Oceanographers say the world isn't facing the same situation it did 12,500 years ago,

112
00:09:41,840 --> 00:09:46,520
when it was coming out of a glaciation and global temperatures were much cooler. So even

113
00:09:46,520 --> 00:09:50,900
if and when a slowdown happens, the Mail's prediction that another ice age would cover

114
00:09:50,900 --> 00:09:55,960
Britain in permanently frozen soil is nothing more than tabloid journalists drawing their

115
00:09:55,960 --> 00:10:02,580
own conclusions. Does all this sound familiar? The 1970s myth about an imminent ice age was

116
00:10:02,580 --> 00:10:07,540
also largely the work of the media, for which scientists are now getting the blame. How

117
00:10:07,540 --> 00:10:12,500
long do you think before people are proclaiming the Daily Mail a champion of truth for busting

118
00:10:12,500 --> 00:10:15,580
a myth that those fraudulent scientists started?
