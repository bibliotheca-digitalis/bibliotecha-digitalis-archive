WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:03.720
People who purport to speak on behalf of science

00:03.720 --> 00:07.280
and then defend the corruption of science for political gain

00:07.280 --> 00:11.240
need to be exposed as the political demagogues that they are.

00:11.240 --> 00:15.240
And of course I'm talking about Potholer 54.

00:15.240 --> 00:18.520
Political demagogue? Moi? Ooh.

00:18.520 --> 00:22.400
I have to say my channel has always steered well clear of politics

00:22.400 --> 00:25.920
and if I am pushing a political point I'm doing a

00:25.920 --> 00:30.400
pretty shitty job of it because no one seems to know what my politics are.

00:30.400 --> 00:34.480
Several people have taken a guess but they've all been wrong.

00:34.480 --> 00:38.560
The reason I don't proclaim my politics is that this is a channel

00:38.560 --> 00:42.560
about science and far from defending the corruption of science

00:42.560 --> 00:46.680
just about every video I put out is attacking the corruption of science

00:46.680 --> 00:51.560
and so is this one. Now while some of you may think that scientific facts

00:51.560 --> 00:55.280
are dependent on politics, funnily enough they're not.

00:55.320 --> 00:59.000
But of course that doesn't stop politicians from trying to invent

00:59.000 --> 01:04.280
a version of science that fits their own political, religious or ideological preferences.

01:04.280 --> 01:08.920
I'm sure we all remember this famous nugget from Sarah Palin

01:08.920 --> 01:10.800
on the subject of fruit fly research.

01:10.800 --> 01:16.000
Sometimes these dollars they go to projects having little or nothing to do with the public good.

01:16.000 --> 01:21.000
Things like fruit fly research in Paris, France. I kid you not.

01:21.000 --> 01:25.040
Just in case you haven't heard this before, I should point out that fruit flies

01:25.040 --> 01:29.320
are specially bred for studying everything from viruses and diseases

01:29.320 --> 01:32.520
to genetics and medical treatments. It's hard to find

01:32.520 --> 01:35.640
any research more geared towards the public good.

01:35.640 --> 01:39.200
So with that benchmark of stupidity to beat

01:39.200 --> 01:42.440
let's look at some of the stupidest and funniest

01:42.440 --> 01:45.440
scientific conclusions made by politicians.

02:25.040 --> 02:43.560
Yes we are going to start with the low-hanging fruit.

02:43.560 --> 02:48.080
President Robert Mugabe gave us this insight into Zimbabwean politics

02:48.080 --> 02:52.480
when he believed a woman who said she could conjure diesel from a rock.

02:52.920 --> 02:57.360
In 2007 he dispatched three nicely dressed government ministers

02:57.360 --> 03:00.400
to witness a demonstration and sure enough

03:00.400 --> 03:04.440
they reported that it was all true. As you can imagine

03:04.440 --> 03:07.560
crude oil, better yet refined diesel

03:07.560 --> 03:11.680
oozing out of a rock would be the answer to Zimbabwe's fuel shortage.

03:11.680 --> 03:15.560
So according to press reports Mugabe gave the woman a million dollars to

03:15.560 --> 03:17.320
conjure up even more diesel

03:17.320 --> 03:21.200
from other rocks. Now there are two possibilities here.

03:21.600 --> 03:26.760
Either this is a magical process that could turn Zimbabwe into a net exporter

03:26.760 --> 03:28.800
of diesel fuel for the whole continent

03:28.800 --> 03:33.160
or it could be an elaborate hoax with a hole drilled into a rock leading to a

03:33.160 --> 03:34.600
pump and a tank of diesel.

03:34.600 --> 03:37.640
It's a toss-up. Hard to say either way.

03:37.640 --> 03:41.840
Okay, turned out it was a tank of diesel being pumped through a man-made hole but

03:41.840 --> 03:44.560
it could have been the answer to Zimbabwe's fuel shortage

03:44.560 --> 03:48.480
so let's not make a complete donkey's arse out of President Mugabe.

03:48.880 --> 03:51.640
We'll put his magic fuel from rocks idea

03:51.640 --> 03:56.440
quite low on the list. Onto the next one. People outside the United States might

03:56.440 --> 03:58.760
not be familiar with Congressman Todd

03:58.760 --> 04:03.680
Akin who four years ago revealed to the world the amazing science that stops

04:03.680 --> 04:07.240
rape victims getting pregnant. From what I understand from doctors

04:07.240 --> 04:10.560
that's really rare. If it's a legitimate rape

04:10.560 --> 04:14.280
the female body has ways to try to shut that whole thing down. Having failed to

04:14.280 --> 04:17.200
explain the technicalities to one TV journalist

04:17.280 --> 04:18.960
Akin tried it with another.

04:18.960 --> 04:24.160
Stress plays some part in fertility. Perhaps you know some people they wanted

04:24.160 --> 04:24.640
to have a

04:24.640 --> 04:28.600
a child and they couldn't seem to do it so they adopt somebody and then pretty

04:28.600 --> 04:29.160
soon

04:29.160 --> 04:32.480
the woman gets pregnant because there isn't the stress.

04:32.480 --> 04:37.080
Ah, I see. So the medical doctors you're quoting determined that a woman who was under

04:37.080 --> 04:38.640
stress when she got raped

04:38.640 --> 04:43.040
wouldn't get pregnant. Which means that those who did get pregnant either weren't

04:43.040 --> 04:44.000
really raped

04:44.320 --> 04:48.240
they made the whole thing up or they weren't under any stress when they were

04:48.240 --> 04:48.760
raped

04:48.760 --> 04:53.080
in other words they secretly enjoyed it. It's beginning to sound less like

04:53.080 --> 04:55.280
something you learned from a medical study Todd

04:55.280 --> 04:58.760
and more like something you heard in the locker room during football training in

04:58.760 --> 04:59.440
high school.

04:59.440 --> 05:06.440
Are you sure you don't want to have another shot at explaining this

05:07.160 --> 05:11.920
scientific theory? I'm not setting myself up as a medical doctor or anything. Yeah, no shit.

05:12.680 --> 05:16.440
And there are a whole series of studies. Great! Well

05:16.440 --> 05:19.840
off you go and get them while I entertain my subscribers with a popular

05:19.840 --> 05:22.120
selection of London Tea Room dance melodies.

05:41.920 --> 05:46.560
Sorry, I can't wait any longer Todd.

05:46.560 --> 05:49.720
You don't have any medical studies do you?

05:49.720 --> 05:54.840
No, that's what I thought. So let's see if we can track this myth down.

05:54.840 --> 05:58.800
His source was probably an obstetrician called John Wilkie

05:58.800 --> 06:02.920
who first came up with this argument. He's written quite a bit about the

06:02.920 --> 06:06.560
capacity of the female body to shut down a pregnancy when raped

06:06.560 --> 06:10.280
and he told the New York Times how it's done. Now

06:10.280 --> 06:13.640
he's an obstetrician so obviously an expert

06:13.640 --> 06:17.320
and here's his study. An expert and a study.

06:17.320 --> 06:22.960
Potholer I hear you cry. What more do you want? Well as I've pointed out many times

06:22.960 --> 06:23.800
in my videos

06:23.800 --> 06:27.600
science is not determined by the opinions of experts.

06:27.600 --> 06:32.000
It's determined by what's been published in respected peer-reviewed scientific

06:32.000 --> 06:32.640
journals

06:32.640 --> 06:36.760
set against what else has been published in respected peer-reviewed scientific

06:36.760 --> 06:37.360
journals.

06:37.760 --> 06:40.440
And Wilkie doesn't even pass the first hurdle.

06:40.440 --> 06:44.920
He may believe this stuff about spasming fallopian tubes

06:44.920 --> 06:50.160
but belief is not science. He's never published any studies outlining his

06:50.160 --> 06:51.920
research, his methodology,

06:51.920 --> 06:54.960
his experiments, his sample sizes or anything

06:54.960 --> 06:59.400
that would allow peer reviewers and other researchers to evaluate his conclusions.

06:59.400 --> 07:04.560
This study isn't a study. It's something Wilkie published in a book.

07:05.560 --> 07:09.560
Now you know why I'm always banging on about not believing the science you see

07:09.560 --> 07:10.280
in books,

07:10.280 --> 07:15.200
blogs, videos, newspapers and on TV unless they cite peer-reviewed scientific

07:15.200 --> 07:18.080
papers published in respected scientific journals.

07:18.080 --> 07:22.640
You could so easily end up with a jury believing that this nonsense is real

07:22.640 --> 07:23.320
science

07:23.320 --> 07:27.240
and acquitting a rapist on the grounds that his victim got pregnant.

07:27.240 --> 07:32.440
Fortunately Aitken was booted out by voters before his wacky conclusions took

07:32.440 --> 07:33.040
hold.

07:33.440 --> 07:36.160
Thank goodness none of the other ideas on this list

07:36.160 --> 07:39.360
are life-threatening. You see when you ask the question

07:39.360 --> 07:42.400
does HIV cause AIDS?

07:42.400 --> 07:45.880
The question is does a virus

07:45.880 --> 07:49.840
cause a syndrome? Oh damn it South African President Thabo Mbeki

07:49.840 --> 07:53.480
with this statement Mbeki took charge of a government

07:53.480 --> 07:57.000
that promoted herbal remedies to treat people with AIDS

07:57.000 --> 08:00.520
instead of retrovirals that might have saved their lives.

08:00.600 --> 08:04.880
How does a virus cause a syndrome? Well perhaps if you read a medical

08:04.880 --> 08:08.320
textbook or ask someone who's published studies on the subject

08:08.320 --> 08:12.680
you'd find out but no Mbeki was getting his information

08:12.680 --> 08:17.760
from the internet and the blogosphere is full of claims that HIV doesn't cause

08:17.760 --> 08:18.260
AIDS

08:18.260 --> 08:23.040
along with a coterie of experts to back them up. There's Peter Duisberg

08:23.040 --> 08:27.520
a professor of molecular and cell biology and Kary Mullis who won a Nobel

08:27.520 --> 08:30.040
Prize for his work in genetic PCR.

08:30.080 --> 08:34.040
There's a group of doctors in Western Australia none of them believes

08:34.040 --> 08:39.400
HIV causes AIDS. But once again winning a Nobel Prize or being a

08:39.400 --> 08:40.840
distinguished professor

08:40.840 --> 08:44.240
doesn't mean that any sound that emanates from your anal sphincter

08:44.240 --> 08:47.360
must be a pearl of infallible scientific wisdom.

08:47.360 --> 08:50.880
Most of these beliefs don't pass the first hurdle

08:50.880 --> 08:54.920
because they're published in blogs rather than respected peer-reviewed

08:54.920 --> 08:56.200
scientific journals.

08:56.200 --> 08:59.200
And although Duisberg has published papers

08:59.400 --> 09:03.160
they've been drowned out by the wealth of evidence coming from studies that show

09:03.160 --> 09:03.720
a very

09:03.720 --> 09:08.680
clear link between HIV and AIDS. It seemed to me that we could not blame

09:08.680 --> 09:13.400
everything on a single virus. A Harvard study concluded that the South African

09:13.400 --> 09:16.240
government's denial of the HIV AIDS link

09:16.240 --> 09:20.000
led to the deaths of over 300,000 people

09:20.000 --> 09:25.560
who didn't get the treatment they needed. When I was compiling this list I thought

09:25.760 --> 09:30.600
some politician somewhere is going to be dumb enough to repeat the internet myth

09:30.600 --> 09:33.960
that vaccines cause autism. So why not Google

09:33.960 --> 09:38.320
vaccines, autism, politician and see what comes up.

09:38.320 --> 09:42.360
Two and a half years old the child, a beautiful child, went to have the vaccine

09:42.360 --> 09:46.280
and came back and a week later got a tremendous fever

09:46.280 --> 09:50.360
got very very sick, now is autistic. Her little daughter

09:50.360 --> 09:53.880
took that vaccine, that injection

09:54.080 --> 09:57.000
and she suffered from mental retardation thereafter.

09:57.000 --> 10:03.280
Yeah, you see the thing is it's sort of like me saying that last week my son had

10:03.280 --> 10:04.560
the MMR vaccine

10:04.560 --> 10:08.280
and a week later he finished first in the 100 meters race at school.

10:08.280 --> 10:12.200
Obviously that would mean vaccines improve athletic performance.

10:12.200 --> 10:17.400
Cause and effect need a correlation and that means taking large sample sizes

10:17.400 --> 10:23.040
and analyzing statistics. Now there was a peer-reviewed study that purported to

10:23.200 --> 10:25.200
show a link between vaccines and autism

10:25.200 --> 10:30.000
so that passes the first hurdle. But it doesn't get past the second

10:30.000 --> 10:33.800
because it was found to be heavily flawed, it was redacted

10:33.800 --> 10:37.200
and every other study shows no link between the two.

10:37.200 --> 10:41.360
So the only place you'll find this claim is where politicians do most of their

10:41.360 --> 10:42.520
reading on science

10:42.520 --> 10:48.000
which is the internet. I won't go into the details of why this is junk science

10:48.000 --> 10:50.040
because you'll find a complete debunk of this

10:50.040 --> 10:55.520
internet myth on my channel. And while we're on the subject to Michelle Backman

10:55.520 --> 10:58.520
here's something else she had to say about science.

10:58.520 --> 11:02.360
I don't think that it has been established yet as a fact

11:02.360 --> 11:05.680
that global warming is the issue of the day.

11:05.680 --> 11:09.480
One thing that we need to do

11:09.480 --> 11:14.440
is look at the science. Funny because I thought looking at the science was the job of

11:14.440 --> 11:18.880
scientists. It's not the job of politicians to look at the science for a

11:18.920 --> 11:20.120
very good reason.

11:20.120 --> 11:24.200
Very few of them have the time to read through the scientific literature

11:24.200 --> 11:28.160
and even if they did they wouldn't understand it because few of them have

11:28.160 --> 11:32.480
any scientific training at all. If you think I'm wrong just keep watching and

11:32.480 --> 11:36.680
you'll see probably the most woeful examples of politicians trying to play

11:36.680 --> 11:37.600
scientist

11:37.600 --> 11:42.960
and showing just how ignorant they are. As far back as 1863

11:42.960 --> 11:47.360
Congress realised that an understanding of the increasing complexity of science

11:47.440 --> 11:52.440
was slipping beyond its cognitive grasp so it decided to establish an advisory

11:52.440 --> 11:53.840
body of scientists.

11:53.840 --> 11:57.000
It's called the National Academy of Sciences

11:57.000 --> 12:01.360
and it's the Academy's job to explain scientific conclusions published in the

12:01.360 --> 12:02.640
scientific literature

12:02.640 --> 12:07.440
to politicians. But these days politicians don't want to hear that.

12:07.440 --> 12:11.080
They think they're smart enough to figure it all out for themselves

12:11.080 --> 12:14.560
even if that means getting all their information from blogs,

12:14.640 --> 12:18.960
half-remembered junior high school science and going on a crash course in

12:18.960 --> 12:20.320
remedial geology.

12:20.320 --> 12:23.720
There have been these back and forth between

12:23.720 --> 12:27.720
on glaciers and the melting that we've seen over and over again.

12:27.720 --> 12:34.360
Why did it happen then if the same factors that you're blaming it on didn't

12:34.360 --> 12:35.240
exist then?

12:35.240 --> 12:39.720
I can give you as much or as little answers that you would like.

12:39.720 --> 12:43.040
Give me 15 seconds. Okay give me 30 if I may.

12:43.200 --> 12:46.840
Yep, you've got 30 seconds to educate me in a field of science that usually

12:46.840 --> 12:48.520
requires a three-year degree

12:48.520 --> 12:51.600
and a basic understanding of physics which I don't have.

12:51.600 --> 12:56.560
And so Richard Alley has to explain the Milankovitch cycles and the concept of

12:56.560 --> 13:01.240
insulation and positive feedback using his head and his bald spot

13:01.240 --> 13:04.480
to represent the Earth and the South Pole respectively.

13:04.480 --> 13:09.520
And when the 30 seconds is up of course Senator Rohr and Bakker still doesn't

13:09.520 --> 13:10.440
understand it

13:10.520 --> 13:13.320
so it must all be wrong.

13:13.320 --> 13:16.880
Let's leave the remedial class and see how politicians are getting on in the

13:16.880 --> 13:17.720
other class

13:17.720 --> 13:21.200
for those with learning difficulties. I live in Wisconsin.

13:21.200 --> 13:24.960
There were two, I think 200 foot thick glaciers

13:24.960 --> 13:28.160
in Wisconsin. How do you explain

13:28.160 --> 13:31.920
the climate change before man ever had a carbon footprint?

13:31.920 --> 13:37.160
The statement that you just made is blatantly false. How do you explain

13:37.200 --> 13:40.800
climate change that occurred 10,000 years ago before man had a carbon

13:40.800 --> 13:43.920
print? Which is science speak for

13:43.920 --> 13:49.840
are you really that stupid? For anyone who thinks Senator Johnson makes a good

13:49.840 --> 13:50.440
point

13:50.440 --> 13:53.640
listen again. He's not making a point.

13:53.640 --> 13:57.800
He doesn't accept the science so he's asking a question which he thinks will

13:57.800 --> 13:59.480
have these researchers stumped.

13:59.480 --> 14:03.760
If he really wants to know what causes glaciations all he has to do is read a

14:03.760 --> 14:04.760
science book

14:04.760 --> 14:09.360
or have a scientist come to his office and explain it or watch my video on the

14:09.360 --> 14:14.240
800 year lag explained where I show that deglaciation was caused by a wobble in

14:14.240 --> 14:15.320
the Earth's axis.

14:15.320 --> 14:19.480
That caused a small increase in insulation in the southern hemisphere

14:19.480 --> 14:23.640
which led to increased water vapour, lower albedo through melting ice

14:23.640 --> 14:27.200
and the degassing of carbon dioxide which in turn

14:27.200 --> 14:32.120
led to more warming. You're welcome Senator. So who else wants to turn a congressional

14:32.120 --> 14:34.240
hearing into a remedial science lesson

14:34.280 --> 14:38.840
by attempting to stump the teacher? Lead scientist at NASA said this

14:38.840 --> 14:42.880
he said that what ended the ice age was global wobbling.

14:42.880 --> 14:46.040
Is the wobbling of the earth included in any of your modeling?

14:46.040 --> 14:50.200
And the answer was no. When you have a model and you say we're going to leave out the

14:50.200 --> 14:52.760
most important impact of that model

14:52.760 --> 14:56.220
out of our theory and not talk about global

14:56.220 --> 15:00.920
wobbling, how can you make projections? Well Congressman it's like this

15:01.320 --> 15:05.360
Global wobbling or the Milankovitch cycles as they're more commonly known

15:05.360 --> 15:08.520
take place over the course of hundreds of thousands of years.

15:08.520 --> 15:12.200
Their effect in the space of a few decades or a few centuries

15:12.200 --> 15:15.400
is so minimal as to be totally ineffective.

15:15.400 --> 15:18.800
But again Congressman Stockman's complete

15:18.800 --> 15:22.520
ignorance on this subject is a given. It's not the point.

15:22.520 --> 15:26.660
The point is he makes the assumption that the science must be wrong

15:26.780 --> 15:29.300
and he's convinced his questions will have all these

15:29.300 --> 15:34.500
know-it-all scientists stumped. They can't possibly have seen the flaw he spotted.

15:34.500 --> 15:39.980
Oh wait, I've just been told that Stockman has managed to spot an even bigger flaw in the theory.

15:39.980 --> 15:43.860
How long will it take for the sea level to rise two feet?

15:43.860 --> 15:48.940
Think about it, if your ice cube melts in your glass it doesn't overflow, it's displacement.

15:48.940 --> 15:52.500
This is the thing, some of the things that they're talking about mathematically and

15:52.500 --> 15:53.380
scientifically

15:53.380 --> 15:57.060
don't make sense.

15:57.060 --> 16:00.860
I think what you mean Congressman is that they don't make sense to you.

16:00.860 --> 16:05.340
And why should they? You're a politician with a bachelor's degree in accounting.

16:05.340 --> 16:08.540
Don't assume that because it doesn't make sense to you

16:08.540 --> 16:12.620
it doesn't make sense to anyone who studied science past tenth grade.

16:12.620 --> 16:16.120
No, scratch that, even second grade kids understand it.

16:16.120 --> 16:20.420
So it's hardly surprising that research glaciologists and oceanographers

16:20.620 --> 16:23.620
spend their entire professional careers understanding it.

16:23.620 --> 16:26.700
Now there is the teeniest possibility,

16:26.700 --> 16:30.460
about the same odds of diesel coming out of a rock, that in the course of a

16:30.460 --> 16:35.260
hundred years of research not one single oceanographer or glaciologist

16:35.260 --> 16:39.980
realised that ice melting in a glass of water doesn't raise the level of water.

16:39.980 --> 16:44.740
It's possible Congressman Stockman in his spare time has discovered something

16:44.740 --> 16:46.700
completely unknown to science.

16:47.140 --> 16:50.820
Or it's possible these oceanographers and glaciologists know something that

16:50.820 --> 16:51.900
Stockman doesn't.

16:51.900 --> 16:57.180
It's a toss-up. So instead of giving Congress the benefit of his theory

16:57.180 --> 17:00.940
it might have been better to go over to the remedial class at the Committee of

17:00.940 --> 17:02.780
Science, Space and Technology.

17:02.780 --> 17:07.180
And Stockman could have asked why it makes sense to scientists and not to him.

17:07.180 --> 17:10.580
He would have been told that melting ice already in the ocean

17:10.580 --> 17:15.740
is not the cause of sea level rise. The cause of sea level rise is partly due to

17:15.780 --> 17:19.460
ice melting on land and pouring into the oceans

17:19.460 --> 17:24.900
to the tune of 150 cubic miles a year and partly due to the thermal expansion

17:24.900 --> 17:25.820
of the oceans

17:25.820 --> 17:30.500
as they warm up. The problem is that this failure to understand the science

17:30.500 --> 17:34.700
not only leads these politicians to conclude that the science must be wrong,

17:34.700 --> 17:38.420
they figure that the only way thousands of scientists can be wrong

17:38.420 --> 17:42.460
is if they're all in on a conspiracy. And if there's a conspiracy

17:42.580 --> 17:46.220
then the politicians can happily ignore the published science and make up their

17:46.220 --> 17:46.700
own.

17:46.700 --> 17:51.660
It's like a downward vortex of ignorance, stupidity, paranoia

17:51.660 --> 17:57.260
and religious conviction. Now you would have thought that Stockman's

17:57.260 --> 18:02.020
ice-in-a-glass theory would rank among the stupidest ever uttered by a politician.

18:02.020 --> 18:06.180
It's got to be up there but there's a lot of competition.

18:06.180 --> 18:09.660
The temperature on Mars is exactly as it is here.

18:10.060 --> 18:14.060
Nobody will dispute that.

18:14.060 --> 18:17.340
It could be secular. It could be just a shift on the axis.

18:17.340 --> 18:20.420
The ice caps are melting which we see over and over again.

18:20.420 --> 18:24.900
Yeah, they're melting on Mars too. One would have to say the Great Flood

18:24.900 --> 18:27.900
is an example of climate change. Yes, he really

18:27.900 --> 18:30.940
is talking about the well-known scientific fact

18:30.940 --> 18:34.420
that Noah led all the animals two by two into an arc.

18:34.420 --> 18:39.140
This is his crucial piece of evidence that carbon dioxide can't cause

18:39.140 --> 18:41.060
atmospheric temperatures to rise.

18:41.060 --> 18:44.380
And that certainly wasn't because mankind had overdeveloped

18:44.380 --> 18:49.260
hydrocarbon energy. No, it was because an invisible being made it rain for

18:49.260 --> 18:52.340
forty days and forty nights and flooded the entire world

18:52.340 --> 18:57.140
and by the way left not a trace. Which brings me neatly onto the number one

18:57.140 --> 19:00.100
wacky idea politicians have about science

19:00.100 --> 19:04.140
that it's all bunk because we were in fact created

19:04.260 --> 19:06.220
6,500 years ago.

19:06.220 --> 19:10.020
I've come to understand that. All that stuff I was taught about evolution

19:10.020 --> 19:14.220
and embryology and big bang theory

19:14.220 --> 19:18.220
all that lies straight from the pit of hell.

19:18.220 --> 19:22.060
Over the last hundred years geology, astronomy and biology have been under

19:22.060 --> 19:22.780
attack

19:22.780 --> 19:26.980
by American politicians who want to influence how these subjects are taught.

19:26.980 --> 19:30.900
Not according to discoveries and conclusions published in the scientific

19:30.900 --> 19:31.580
literature

19:31.900 --> 19:34.900
which is how it's done in the rest of the world but according to the

19:34.900 --> 19:35.700
politicians'

19:35.700 --> 19:40.740
own beliefs. The battle began in the 1920s when several states

19:40.740 --> 19:44.260
banned the teaching of evolution and it's still going on today

19:44.260 --> 19:48.900
as they try to push creationism into science classes.

19:48.900 --> 19:52.420
It's difficult to know how much this literal belief in creation

19:52.420 --> 19:56.300
is fueling the anti-science movement among American politicians.

19:56.300 --> 20:00.500
I never ascribe motivation because I can't read people's minds

20:00.620 --> 20:05.540
but often they make the link themselves. Todd Akins remarks about rape victims

20:05.540 --> 20:06.740
not getting pregnant

20:06.740 --> 20:10.500
were used to justify refusing abortion to rape victims

20:10.500 --> 20:15.220
and his strong anti-abortion views were in turn shaped by his religion.

20:15.220 --> 20:19.940
This guy who was chairman of the House Committee on Science, Space and Technology

20:19.940 --> 20:24.620
refused to accept that carbon dioxide affects atmospheric temperature because

20:24.620 --> 20:28.020
because we can't control what God

20:28.340 --> 20:31.780
does. Now I've restricted my list to the

20:31.780 --> 20:36.060
English-speaking world and to advanced democracies but you might well ask

20:36.060 --> 20:40.740
why are most of the people on Pottole's list conservative American politicians?

20:40.740 --> 20:45.980
Yes! Good question! I'd like to know the answer to that too.

20:45.980 --> 20:49.020
It's certainly not because Americans are dumb.

20:49.020 --> 20:52.340
After all this is the land of technology and innovation

20:52.340 --> 20:55.620
which has produced some of the greatest scientific minds of our age.

20:56.340 --> 20:59.980
And it's certainly not because conservatives are scientifically illiterate.

20:59.980 --> 21:03.540
Far from it. In other advanced democracies like

21:03.540 --> 21:08.100
Europe and Japan conservatives are just as accepting of scientific conclusions

21:08.100 --> 21:08.400
as

21:08.400 --> 21:13.100
any other part of the political spectrum. I found examples of politicians on the

21:13.100 --> 21:14.780
left fudging the science

21:14.780 --> 21:18.660
that's in my videos but I haven't come across examples of them

21:18.660 --> 21:22.860
refusing to accept the conclusions of researchers or trying to substitute

21:22.860 --> 21:24.300
their own science.

21:24.780 --> 21:28.300
So don't blame me. American conservatives themselves

21:28.300 --> 21:32.240
see this as a battle between liberals, people on the left who accept the

21:32.240 --> 21:33.220
published science

21:33.220 --> 21:35.460
and conservatives who don't.

21:35.460 --> 21:39.660
I've instinctively known this from the get-go from 20 years ago. The whole thing's made up.

21:39.660 --> 21:42.260
And the reason I know it is because liberals are behind it.

21:42.260 --> 21:46.420
Conservapedia thinks evolution, plate tectonics, black holes, dark matter

21:46.420 --> 21:50.460
and just about anything in the realms of science are part of a liberal plot.

21:50.940 --> 21:55.300
For politicians to echo these beliefs, well it's a situation that conservatives

21:55.300 --> 21:55.540
in

21:55.540 --> 22:00.780
other parts of the world find bizarre. Being a conservative means believing in

22:00.780 --> 22:01.840
free markets

22:01.840 --> 22:06.420
and minimising the role of government in the economy. It means defending individual

22:06.420 --> 22:08.520
freedoms from the power of the state.

22:08.520 --> 22:12.060
It means individual responsibility and accountability.

22:12.060 --> 22:16.140
It means a lot of things that have been expounded in conservative creeds

22:16.140 --> 22:19.360
from various think tanks and individuals. It

22:19.360 --> 22:22.480
doesn't mean rejecting scientific conclusions

22:22.480 --> 22:27.640
or making up scientific facts to suit your ideological or religious beliefs.

22:27.640 --> 22:30.520
That's never been a conservative principle.

22:30.520 --> 22:34.780
It could be just a shift on the axis. So here's my advice to American politicians

22:34.780 --> 22:38.400
who don't seem to be on board with the bipartisan approach to science

22:38.400 --> 22:44.080
adopted in other advanced democracies. Your job isn't to do a 30-second crash

22:44.080 --> 22:46.400
course in a complex scientific subject

22:46.600 --> 22:50.360
and when you don't understand it decide to make up your own science instead.

22:50.360 --> 22:53.920
Your job is to decide what policies to implement

22:53.920 --> 22:58.040
based on scientific conclusions that have been published in respected

22:58.040 --> 23:02.880
peer-reviewed scientific journals. And if you don't know what those conclusions are

23:02.880 --> 23:07.160
ask the scientists doing the research or the institutions that have been set up

23:07.160 --> 23:08.480
to do the research

23:08.480 --> 23:12.300
or the National Academy of Sciences that was set up to advise you

23:12.300 --> 23:16.060
what those conclusions are. Don't have a scientific hearing

23:16.060 --> 23:19.980
and call another politician as your only witness.

23:19.980 --> 23:24.540
Don't ask busy researchers for a 30-second crash course in

23:24.540 --> 23:28.980
basic physics so you can decide for yourself whether their conclusions are

23:28.980 --> 23:29.620
right.

23:29.620 --> 23:33.140
But as you sit there in your chair with your data we sit up here

23:33.140 --> 23:36.780
with our data and the constituents and stuff behind us. You don't have the

23:36.780 --> 23:38.380
basic scientific knowledge

23:38.460 --> 23:40.780
or the time to understand it all.

23:40.780 --> 23:45.460
Your job is not to pick and choose which bits of science you want to accept

23:45.460 --> 23:48.580
based on your ideological or religious beliefs.

23:48.580 --> 23:51.620
So if you don't want to impose a carbon tax

23:51.620 --> 23:56.060
then vote against it. Don't use the excuse that the science doesn't make

23:56.060 --> 23:56.940
sense to you

23:56.940 --> 24:01.340
and therefore it must be wrong. And if you want to vote against legalising

24:01.340 --> 24:02.860
abortion for rape victims

24:02.860 --> 24:07.860
then be honest and vote for that. Don't invoke some scientific claptrap about how

24:07.900 --> 24:09.340
women who get pregnant

24:09.340 --> 24:13.460
haven't really been raped. And if you want kids to learn your religious

24:13.460 --> 24:14.100
beliefs

24:14.100 --> 24:17.980
fine! Be honest and vote for a bill that mandates that.

24:17.980 --> 24:21.620
Don't give your religious beliefs some pseudo-scientific title

24:21.620 --> 24:25.700
then pretend scientists are divided over the issue so that both sides need to be

24:25.700 --> 24:26.940
taught in school.

24:26.940 --> 24:31.820
In other words, don't make up your own science or hide behind pseudo-researchers

24:31.820 --> 24:33.540
who've never published their beliefs

24:33.700 --> 24:37.900
simply because real scientific conclusions might lead to a policy you

24:37.900 --> 24:38.620
don't like.
