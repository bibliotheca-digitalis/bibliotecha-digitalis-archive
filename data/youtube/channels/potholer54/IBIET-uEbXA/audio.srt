1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,720
People who purport to speak on behalf of science

2
00:00:03,720 --> 00:00:07,280
and then defend the corruption of science for political gain

3
00:00:07,280 --> 00:00:11,240
need to be exposed as the political demagogues that they are.

4
00:00:11,240 --> 00:00:15,240
And of course I'm talking about Potholer 54.

5
00:00:15,240 --> 00:00:18,520
Political demagogue? Moi? Ooh.

6
00:00:18,520 --> 00:00:22,400
I have to say my channel has always steered well clear of politics

7
00:00:22,400 --> 00:00:25,920
and if I am pushing a political point I'm doing a

8
00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:30,400
pretty shitty job of it because no one seems to know what my politics are.

9
00:00:30,400 --> 00:00:34,480
Several people have taken a guess but they've all been wrong.

10
00:00:34,480 --> 00:00:38,560
The reason I don't proclaim my politics is that this is a channel

11
00:00:38,560 --> 00:00:42,560
about science and far from defending the corruption of science

12
00:00:42,560 --> 00:00:46,680
just about every video I put out is attacking the corruption of science

13
00:00:46,680 --> 00:00:51,560
and so is this one. Now while some of you may think that scientific facts

14
00:00:51,560 --> 00:00:55,280
are dependent on politics, funnily enough they're not.

15
00:00:55,320 --> 00:00:59,000
But of course that doesn't stop politicians from trying to invent

16
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:04,280
a version of science that fits their own political, religious or ideological preferences.

17
00:01:04,280 --> 00:01:08,920
I'm sure we all remember this famous nugget from Sarah Palin

18
00:01:08,920 --> 00:01:10,800
on the subject of fruit fly research.

19
00:01:10,800 --> 00:01:16,000
Sometimes these dollars they go to projects having little or nothing to do with the public good.

20
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:21,000
Things like fruit fly research in Paris, France. I kid you not.

21
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:25,040
Just in case you haven't heard this before, I should point out that fruit flies

22
00:01:25,040 --> 00:01:29,320
are specially bred for studying everything from viruses and diseases

23
00:01:29,320 --> 00:01:32,520
to genetics and medical treatments. It's hard to find

24
00:01:32,520 --> 00:01:35,640
any research more geared towards the public good.

25
00:01:35,640 --> 00:01:39,200
So with that benchmark of stupidity to beat

26
00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:42,440
let's look at some of the stupidest and funniest

27
00:01:42,440 --> 00:01:45,440
scientific conclusions made by politicians.

28
00:02:25,040 --> 00:02:43,560
Yes we are going to start with the low-hanging fruit.

29
00:02:43,560 --> 00:02:48,080
President Robert Mugabe gave us this insight into Zimbabwean politics

30
00:02:48,080 --> 00:02:52,480
when he believed a woman who said she could conjure diesel from a rock.

31
00:02:52,920 --> 00:02:57,360
In 2007 he dispatched three nicely dressed government ministers

32
00:02:57,360 --> 00:03:00,400
to witness a demonstration and sure enough

33
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:04,440
they reported that it was all true. As you can imagine

34
00:03:04,440 --> 00:03:07,560
crude oil, better yet refined diesel

35
00:03:07,560 --> 00:03:11,680
oozing out of a rock would be the answer to Zimbabwe's fuel shortage.

36
00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:15,560
So according to press reports Mugabe gave the woman a million dollars to

37
00:03:15,560 --> 00:03:17,320
conjure up even more diesel

38
00:03:17,320 --> 00:03:21,200
from other rocks. Now there are two possibilities here.

39
00:03:21,600 --> 00:03:26,760
Either this is a magical process that could turn Zimbabwe into a net exporter

40
00:03:26,760 --> 00:03:28,800
of diesel fuel for the whole continent

41
00:03:28,800 --> 00:03:33,160
or it could be an elaborate hoax with a hole drilled into a rock leading to a

42
00:03:33,160 --> 00:03:34,600
pump and a tank of diesel.

43
00:03:34,600 --> 00:03:37,640
It's a toss-up. Hard to say either way.

44
00:03:37,640 --> 00:03:41,840
Okay, turned out it was a tank of diesel being pumped through a man-made hole but

45
00:03:41,840 --> 00:03:44,560
it could have been the answer to Zimbabwe's fuel shortage

46
00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:48,480
so let's not make a complete donkey's arse out of President Mugabe.

47
00:03:48,880 --> 00:03:51,640
We'll put his magic fuel from rocks idea

48
00:03:51,640 --> 00:03:56,440
quite low on the list. Onto the next one. People outside the United States might

49
00:03:56,440 --> 00:03:58,760
not be familiar with Congressman Todd

50
00:03:58,760 --> 00:04:03,680
Akin who four years ago revealed to the world the amazing science that stops

51
00:04:03,680 --> 00:04:07,240
rape victims getting pregnant. From what I understand from doctors

52
00:04:07,240 --> 00:04:10,560
that's really rare. If it's a legitimate rape

53
00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:14,280
the female body has ways to try to shut that whole thing down. Having failed to

54
00:04:14,280 --> 00:04:17,200
explain the technicalities to one TV journalist

55
00:04:17,280 --> 00:04:18,960
Akin tried it with another.

56
00:04:18,960 --> 00:04:24,160
Stress plays some part in fertility. Perhaps you know some people they wanted

57
00:04:24,160 --> 00:04:24,640
to have a

58
00:04:24,640 --> 00:04:28,600
a child and they couldn't seem to do it so they adopt somebody and then pretty

59
00:04:28,600 --> 00:04:29,160
soon

60
00:04:29,160 --> 00:04:32,480
the woman gets pregnant because there isn't the stress.

61
00:04:32,480 --> 00:04:37,080
Ah, I see. So the medical doctors you're quoting determined that a woman who was under

62
00:04:37,080 --> 00:04:38,640
stress when she got raped

63
00:04:38,640 --> 00:04:43,040
wouldn't get pregnant. Which means that those who did get pregnant either weren't

64
00:04:43,040 --> 00:04:44,000
really raped

65
00:04:44,320 --> 00:04:48,240
they made the whole thing up or they weren't under any stress when they were

66
00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:48,760
raped

67
00:04:48,760 --> 00:04:53,080
in other words they secretly enjoyed it. It's beginning to sound less like

68
00:04:53,080 --> 00:04:55,280
something you learned from a medical study Todd

69
00:04:55,280 --> 00:04:58,760
and more like something you heard in the locker room during football training in

70
00:04:58,760 --> 00:04:59,440
high school.

71
00:04:59,440 --> 00:05:06,440
Are you sure you don't want to have another shot at explaining this

72
00:05:07,160 --> 00:05:11,920
scientific theory? I'm not setting myself up as a medical doctor or anything. Yeah, no shit.

73
00:05:12,680 --> 00:05:16,440
And there are a whole series of studies. Great! Well

74
00:05:16,440 --> 00:05:19,840
off you go and get them while I entertain my subscribers with a popular

75
00:05:19,840 --> 00:05:22,120
selection of London Tea Room dance melodies.

76
00:05:41,920 --> 00:05:46,560
Sorry, I can't wait any longer Todd.

77
00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:49,720
You don't have any medical studies do you?

78
00:05:49,720 --> 00:05:54,840
No, that's what I thought. So let's see if we can track this myth down.

79
00:05:54,840 --> 00:05:58,800
His source was probably an obstetrician called John Wilkie

80
00:05:58,800 --> 00:06:02,920
who first came up with this argument. He's written quite a bit about the

81
00:06:02,920 --> 00:06:06,560
capacity of the female body to shut down a pregnancy when raped

82
00:06:06,560 --> 00:06:10,280
and he told the New York Times how it's done. Now

83
00:06:10,280 --> 00:06:13,640
he's an obstetrician so obviously an expert

84
00:06:13,640 --> 00:06:17,320
and here's his study. An expert and a study.

85
00:06:17,320 --> 00:06:22,960
Potholer I hear you cry. What more do you want? Well as I've pointed out many times

86
00:06:22,960 --> 00:06:23,800
in my videos

87
00:06:23,800 --> 00:06:27,600
science is not determined by the opinions of experts.

88
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:32,000
It's determined by what's been published in respected peer-reviewed scientific

89
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:32,640
journals

90
00:06:32,640 --> 00:06:36,760
set against what else has been published in respected peer-reviewed scientific

91
00:06:36,760 --> 00:06:37,360
journals.

92
00:06:37,760 --> 00:06:40,440
And Wilkie doesn't even pass the first hurdle.

93
00:06:40,440 --> 00:06:44,920
He may believe this stuff about spasming fallopian tubes

94
00:06:44,920 --> 00:06:50,160
but belief is not science. He's never published any studies outlining his

95
00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:51,920
research, his methodology,

96
00:06:51,920 --> 00:06:54,960
his experiments, his sample sizes or anything

97
00:06:54,960 --> 00:06:59,400
that would allow peer reviewers and other researchers to evaluate his conclusions.

98
00:06:59,400 --> 00:07:04,560
This study isn't a study. It's something Wilkie published in a book.

99
00:07:05,560 --> 00:07:09,560
Now you know why I'm always banging on about not believing the science you see

100
00:07:09,560 --> 00:07:10,280
in books,

101
00:07:10,280 --> 00:07:15,200
blogs, videos, newspapers and on TV unless they cite peer-reviewed scientific

102
00:07:15,200 --> 00:07:18,080
papers published in respected scientific journals.

103
00:07:18,080 --> 00:07:22,640
You could so easily end up with a jury believing that this nonsense is real

104
00:07:22,640 --> 00:07:23,320
science

105
00:07:23,320 --> 00:07:27,240
and acquitting a rapist on the grounds that his victim got pregnant.

106
00:07:27,240 --> 00:07:32,440
Fortunately Aitken was booted out by voters before his wacky conclusions took

107
00:07:32,440 --> 00:07:33,040
hold.

108
00:07:33,440 --> 00:07:36,160
Thank goodness none of the other ideas on this list

109
00:07:36,160 --> 00:07:39,360
are life-threatening. You see when you ask the question

110
00:07:39,360 --> 00:07:42,400
does HIV cause AIDS?

111
00:07:42,400 --> 00:07:45,880
The question is does a virus

112
00:07:45,880 --> 00:07:49,840
cause a syndrome? Oh damn it South African President Thabo Mbeki

113
00:07:49,840 --> 00:07:53,480
with this statement Mbeki took charge of a government

114
00:07:53,480 --> 00:07:57,000
that promoted herbal remedies to treat people with AIDS

115
00:07:57,000 --> 00:08:00,520
instead of retrovirals that might have saved their lives.

116
00:08:00,600 --> 00:08:04,880
How does a virus cause a syndrome? Well perhaps if you read a medical

117
00:08:04,880 --> 00:08:08,320
textbook or ask someone who's published studies on the subject

118
00:08:08,320 --> 00:08:12,680
you'd find out but no Mbeki was getting his information

119
00:08:12,680 --> 00:08:17,760
from the internet and the blogosphere is full of claims that HIV doesn't cause

120
00:08:17,760 --> 00:08:18,260
AIDS

121
00:08:18,260 --> 00:08:23,040
along with a coterie of experts to back them up. There's Peter Duisberg

122
00:08:23,040 --> 00:08:27,520
a professor of molecular and cell biology and Kary Mullis who won a Nobel

123
00:08:27,520 --> 00:08:30,040
Prize for his work in genetic PCR.

124
00:08:30,080 --> 00:08:34,040
There's a group of doctors in Western Australia none of them believes

125
00:08:34,040 --> 00:08:39,400
HIV causes AIDS. But once again winning a Nobel Prize or being a

126
00:08:39,400 --> 00:08:40,840
distinguished professor

127
00:08:40,840 --> 00:08:44,240
doesn't mean that any sound that emanates from your anal sphincter

128
00:08:44,240 --> 00:08:47,360
must be a pearl of infallible scientific wisdom.

129
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:50,880
Most of these beliefs don't pass the first hurdle

130
00:08:50,880 --> 00:08:54,920
because they're published in blogs rather than respected peer-reviewed

131
00:08:54,920 --> 00:08:56,200
scientific journals.

132
00:08:56,200 --> 00:08:59,200
And although Duisberg has published papers

133
00:08:59,400 --> 00:09:03,160
they've been drowned out by the wealth of evidence coming from studies that show

134
00:09:03,160 --> 00:09:03,720
a very

135
00:09:03,720 --> 00:09:08,680
clear link between HIV and AIDS. It seemed to me that we could not blame

136
00:09:08,680 --> 00:09:13,400
everything on a single virus. A Harvard study concluded that the South African

137
00:09:13,400 --> 00:09:16,240
government's denial of the HIV AIDS link

138
00:09:16,240 --> 00:09:20,000
led to the deaths of over 300,000 people

139
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:25,560
who didn't get the treatment they needed. When I was compiling this list I thought

140
00:09:25,760 --> 00:09:30,600
some politician somewhere is going to be dumb enough to repeat the internet myth

141
00:09:30,600 --> 00:09:33,960
that vaccines cause autism. So why not Google

142
00:09:33,960 --> 00:09:38,320
vaccines, autism, politician and see what comes up.

143
00:09:38,320 --> 00:09:42,360
Two and a half years old the child, a beautiful child, went to have the vaccine

144
00:09:42,360 --> 00:09:46,280
and came back and a week later got a tremendous fever

145
00:09:46,280 --> 00:09:50,360
got very very sick, now is autistic. Her little daughter

146
00:09:50,360 --> 00:09:53,880
took that vaccine, that injection

147
00:09:54,080 --> 00:09:57,000
and she suffered from mental retardation thereafter.

148
00:09:57,000 --> 00:10:03,280
Yeah, you see the thing is it's sort of like me saying that last week my son had

149
00:10:03,280 --> 00:10:04,560
the MMR vaccine

150
00:10:04,560 --> 00:10:08,280
and a week later he finished first in the 100 meters race at school.

151
00:10:08,280 --> 00:10:12,200
Obviously that would mean vaccines improve athletic performance.

152
00:10:12,200 --> 00:10:17,400
Cause and effect need a correlation and that means taking large sample sizes

153
00:10:17,400 --> 00:10:23,040
and analyzing statistics. Now there was a peer-reviewed study that purported to

154
00:10:23,200 --> 00:10:25,200
show a link between vaccines and autism

155
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:30,000
so that passes the first hurdle. But it doesn't get past the second

156
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:33,800
because it was found to be heavily flawed, it was redacted

157
00:10:33,800 --> 00:10:37,200
and every other study shows no link between the two.

158
00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:41,360
So the only place you'll find this claim is where politicians do most of their

159
00:10:41,360 --> 00:10:42,520
reading on science

160
00:10:42,520 --> 00:10:48,000
which is the internet. I won't go into the details of why this is junk science

161
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:50,040
because you'll find a complete debunk of this

162
00:10:50,040 --> 00:10:55,520
internet myth on my channel. And while we're on the subject to Michelle Backman

163
00:10:55,520 --> 00:10:58,520
here's something else she had to say about science.

164
00:10:58,520 --> 00:11:02,360
I don't think that it has been established yet as a fact

165
00:11:02,360 --> 00:11:05,680
that global warming is the issue of the day.

166
00:11:05,680 --> 00:11:09,480
One thing that we need to do

167
00:11:09,480 --> 00:11:14,440
is look at the science. Funny because I thought looking at the science was the job of

168
00:11:14,440 --> 00:11:18,880
scientists. It's not the job of politicians to look at the science for a

169
00:11:18,920 --> 00:11:20,120
very good reason.

170
00:11:20,120 --> 00:11:24,200
Very few of them have the time to read through the scientific literature

171
00:11:24,200 --> 00:11:28,160
and even if they did they wouldn't understand it because few of them have

172
00:11:28,160 --> 00:11:32,480
any scientific training at all. If you think I'm wrong just keep watching and

173
00:11:32,480 --> 00:11:36,680
you'll see probably the most woeful examples of politicians trying to play

174
00:11:36,680 --> 00:11:37,600
scientist

175
00:11:37,600 --> 00:11:42,960
and showing just how ignorant they are. As far back as 1863

176
00:11:42,960 --> 00:11:47,360
Congress realised that an understanding of the increasing complexity of science

177
00:11:47,440 --> 00:11:52,440
was slipping beyond its cognitive grasp so it decided to establish an advisory

178
00:11:52,440 --> 00:11:53,840
body of scientists.

179
00:11:53,840 --> 00:11:57,000
It's called the National Academy of Sciences

180
00:11:57,000 --> 00:12:01,360
and it's the Academy's job to explain scientific conclusions published in the

181
00:12:01,360 --> 00:12:02,640
scientific literature

182
00:12:02,640 --> 00:12:07,440
to politicians. But these days politicians don't want to hear that.

183
00:12:07,440 --> 00:12:11,080
They think they're smart enough to figure it all out for themselves

184
00:12:11,080 --> 00:12:14,560
even if that means getting all their information from blogs,

185
00:12:14,640 --> 00:12:18,960
half-remembered junior high school science and going on a crash course in

186
00:12:18,960 --> 00:12:20,320
remedial geology.

187
00:12:20,320 --> 00:12:23,720
There have been these back and forth between

188
00:12:23,720 --> 00:12:27,720
on glaciers and the melting that we've seen over and over again.

189
00:12:27,720 --> 00:12:34,360
Why did it happen then if the same factors that you're blaming it on didn't

190
00:12:34,360 --> 00:12:35,240
exist then?

191
00:12:35,240 --> 00:12:39,720
I can give you as much or as little answers that you would like.

192
00:12:39,720 --> 00:12:43,040
Give me 15 seconds. Okay give me 30 if I may.

193
00:12:43,200 --> 00:12:46,840
Yep, you've got 30 seconds to educate me in a field of science that usually

194
00:12:46,840 --> 00:12:48,520
requires a three-year degree

195
00:12:48,520 --> 00:12:51,600
and a basic understanding of physics which I don't have.

196
00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:56,560
And so Richard Alley has to explain the Milankovitch cycles and the concept of

197
00:12:56,560 --> 00:13:01,240
insulation and positive feedback using his head and his bald spot

198
00:13:01,240 --> 00:13:04,480
to represent the Earth and the South Pole respectively.

199
00:13:04,480 --> 00:13:09,520
And when the 30 seconds is up of course Senator Rohr and Bakker still doesn't

200
00:13:09,520 --> 00:13:10,440
understand it

201
00:13:10,520 --> 00:13:13,320
so it must all be wrong.

202
00:13:13,320 --> 00:13:16,880
Let's leave the remedial class and see how politicians are getting on in the

203
00:13:16,880 --> 00:13:17,720
other class

204
00:13:17,720 --> 00:13:21,200
for those with learning difficulties. I live in Wisconsin.

205
00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:24,960
There were two, I think 200 foot thick glaciers

206
00:13:24,960 --> 00:13:28,160
in Wisconsin. How do you explain

207
00:13:28,160 --> 00:13:31,920
the climate change before man ever had a carbon footprint?

208
00:13:31,920 --> 00:13:37,160
The statement that you just made is blatantly false. How do you explain

209
00:13:37,200 --> 00:13:40,800
climate change that occurred 10,000 years ago before man had a carbon

210
00:13:40,800 --> 00:13:43,920
print? Which is science speak for

211
00:13:43,920 --> 00:13:49,840
are you really that stupid? For anyone who thinks Senator Johnson makes a good

212
00:13:49,840 --> 00:13:50,440
point

213
00:13:50,440 --> 00:13:53,640
listen again. He's not making a point.

214
00:13:53,640 --> 00:13:57,800
He doesn't accept the science so he's asking a question which he thinks will

215
00:13:57,800 --> 00:13:59,480
have these researchers stumped.

216
00:13:59,480 --> 00:14:03,760
If he really wants to know what causes glaciations all he has to do is read a

217
00:14:03,760 --> 00:14:04,760
science book

218
00:14:04,760 --> 00:14:09,360
or have a scientist come to his office and explain it or watch my video on the

219
00:14:09,360 --> 00:14:14,240
800 year lag explained where I show that deglaciation was caused by a wobble in

220
00:14:14,240 --> 00:14:15,320
the Earth's axis.

221
00:14:15,320 --> 00:14:19,480
That caused a small increase in insulation in the southern hemisphere

222
00:14:19,480 --> 00:14:23,640
which led to increased water vapour, lower albedo through melting ice

223
00:14:23,640 --> 00:14:27,200
and the degassing of carbon dioxide which in turn

224
00:14:27,200 --> 00:14:32,120
led to more warming. You're welcome Senator. So who else wants to turn a congressional

225
00:14:32,120 --> 00:14:34,240
hearing into a remedial science lesson

226
00:14:34,280 --> 00:14:38,840
by attempting to stump the teacher? Lead scientist at NASA said this

227
00:14:38,840 --> 00:14:42,880
he said that what ended the ice age was global wobbling.

228
00:14:42,880 --> 00:14:46,040
Is the wobbling of the earth included in any of your modeling?

229
00:14:46,040 --> 00:14:50,200
And the answer was no. When you have a model and you say we're going to leave out the

230
00:14:50,200 --> 00:14:52,760
most important impact of that model

231
00:14:52,760 --> 00:14:56,220
out of our theory and not talk about global

232
00:14:56,220 --> 00:15:00,920
wobbling, how can you make projections? Well Congressman it's like this

233
00:15:01,320 --> 00:15:05,360
Global wobbling or the Milankovitch cycles as they're more commonly known

234
00:15:05,360 --> 00:15:08,520
take place over the course of hundreds of thousands of years.

235
00:15:08,520 --> 00:15:12,200
Their effect in the space of a few decades or a few centuries

236
00:15:12,200 --> 00:15:15,400
is so minimal as to be totally ineffective.

237
00:15:15,400 --> 00:15:18,800
But again Congressman Stockman's complete

238
00:15:18,800 --> 00:15:22,520
ignorance on this subject is a given. It's not the point.

239
00:15:22,520 --> 00:15:26,660
The point is he makes the assumption that the science must be wrong

240
00:15:26,780 --> 00:15:29,300
and he's convinced his questions will have all these

241
00:15:29,300 --> 00:15:34,500
know-it-all scientists stumped. They can't possibly have seen the flaw he spotted.

242
00:15:34,500 --> 00:15:39,980
Oh wait, I've just been told that Stockman has managed to spot an even bigger flaw in the theory.

243
00:15:39,980 --> 00:15:43,860
How long will it take for the sea level to rise two feet?

244
00:15:43,860 --> 00:15:48,940
Think about it, if your ice cube melts in your glass it doesn't overflow, it's displacement.

245
00:15:48,940 --> 00:15:52,500
This is the thing, some of the things that they're talking about mathematically and

246
00:15:52,500 --> 00:15:53,380
scientifically

247
00:15:53,380 --> 00:15:57,060
don't make sense.

248
00:15:57,060 --> 00:16:00,860
I think what you mean Congressman is that they don't make sense to you.

249
00:16:00,860 --> 00:16:05,340
And why should they? You're a politician with a bachelor's degree in accounting.

250
00:16:05,340 --> 00:16:08,540
Don't assume that because it doesn't make sense to you

251
00:16:08,540 --> 00:16:12,620
it doesn't make sense to anyone who studied science past tenth grade.

252
00:16:12,620 --> 00:16:16,120
No, scratch that, even second grade kids understand it.

253
00:16:16,120 --> 00:16:20,420
So it's hardly surprising that research glaciologists and oceanographers

254
00:16:20,620 --> 00:16:23,620
spend their entire professional careers understanding it.

255
00:16:23,620 --> 00:16:26,700
Now there is the teeniest possibility,

256
00:16:26,700 --> 00:16:30,460
about the same odds of diesel coming out of a rock, that in the course of a

257
00:16:30,460 --> 00:16:35,260
hundred years of research not one single oceanographer or glaciologist

258
00:16:35,260 --> 00:16:39,980
realised that ice melting in a glass of water doesn't raise the level of water.

259
00:16:39,980 --> 00:16:44,740
It's possible Congressman Stockman in his spare time has discovered something

260
00:16:44,740 --> 00:16:46,700
completely unknown to science.

261
00:16:47,140 --> 00:16:50,820
Or it's possible these oceanographers and glaciologists know something that

262
00:16:50,820 --> 00:16:51,900
Stockman doesn't.

263
00:16:51,900 --> 00:16:57,180
It's a toss-up. So instead of giving Congress the benefit of his theory

264
00:16:57,180 --> 00:17:00,940
it might have been better to go over to the remedial class at the Committee of

265
00:17:00,940 --> 00:17:02,780
Science, Space and Technology.

266
00:17:02,780 --> 00:17:07,180
And Stockman could have asked why it makes sense to scientists and not to him.

267
00:17:07,180 --> 00:17:10,580
He would have been told that melting ice already in the ocean

268
00:17:10,580 --> 00:17:15,740
is not the cause of sea level rise. The cause of sea level rise is partly due to

269
00:17:15,780 --> 00:17:19,460
ice melting on land and pouring into the oceans

270
00:17:19,460 --> 00:17:24,900
to the tune of 150 cubic miles a year and partly due to the thermal expansion

271
00:17:24,900 --> 00:17:25,820
of the oceans

272
00:17:25,820 --> 00:17:30,500
as they warm up. The problem is that this failure to understand the science

273
00:17:30,500 --> 00:17:34,700
not only leads these politicians to conclude that the science must be wrong,

274
00:17:34,700 --> 00:17:38,420
they figure that the only way thousands of scientists can be wrong

275
00:17:38,420 --> 00:17:42,460
is if they're all in on a conspiracy. And if there's a conspiracy

276
00:17:42,580 --> 00:17:46,220
then the politicians can happily ignore the published science and make up their

277
00:17:46,220 --> 00:17:46,700
own.

278
00:17:46,700 --> 00:17:51,660
It's like a downward vortex of ignorance, stupidity, paranoia

279
00:17:51,660 --> 00:17:57,260
and religious conviction. Now you would have thought that Stockman's

280
00:17:57,260 --> 00:18:02,020
ice-in-a-glass theory would rank among the stupidest ever uttered by a politician.

281
00:18:02,020 --> 00:18:06,180
It's got to be up there but there's a lot of competition.

282
00:18:06,180 --> 00:18:09,660
The temperature on Mars is exactly as it is here.

283
00:18:10,060 --> 00:18:14,060
Nobody will dispute that.

284
00:18:14,060 --> 00:18:17,340
It could be secular. It could be just a shift on the axis.

285
00:18:17,340 --> 00:18:20,420
The ice caps are melting which we see over and over again.

286
00:18:20,420 --> 00:18:24,900
Yeah, they're melting on Mars too. One would have to say the Great Flood

287
00:18:24,900 --> 00:18:27,900
is an example of climate change. Yes, he really

288
00:18:27,900 --> 00:18:30,940
is talking about the well-known scientific fact

289
00:18:30,940 --> 00:18:34,420
that Noah led all the animals two by two into an arc.

290
00:18:34,420 --> 00:18:39,140
This is his crucial piece of evidence that carbon dioxide can't cause

291
00:18:39,140 --> 00:18:41,060
atmospheric temperatures to rise.

292
00:18:41,060 --> 00:18:44,380
And that certainly wasn't because mankind had overdeveloped

293
00:18:44,380 --> 00:18:49,260
hydrocarbon energy. No, it was because an invisible being made it rain for

294
00:18:49,260 --> 00:18:52,340
forty days and forty nights and flooded the entire world

295
00:18:52,340 --> 00:18:57,140
and by the way left not a trace. Which brings me neatly onto the number one

296
00:18:57,140 --> 00:19:00,100
wacky idea politicians have about science

297
00:19:00,100 --> 00:19:04,140
that it's all bunk because we were in fact created

298
00:19:04,260 --> 00:19:06,220
6,500 years ago.

299
00:19:06,220 --> 00:19:10,020
I've come to understand that. All that stuff I was taught about evolution

300
00:19:10,020 --> 00:19:14,220
and embryology and big bang theory

301
00:19:14,220 --> 00:19:18,220
all that lies straight from the pit of hell.

302
00:19:18,220 --> 00:19:22,060
Over the last hundred years geology, astronomy and biology have been under

303
00:19:22,060 --> 00:19:22,780
attack

304
00:19:22,780 --> 00:19:26,980
by American politicians who want to influence how these subjects are taught.

305
00:19:26,980 --> 00:19:30,900
Not according to discoveries and conclusions published in the scientific

306
00:19:30,900 --> 00:19:31,580
literature

307
00:19:31,900 --> 00:19:34,900
which is how it's done in the rest of the world but according to the

308
00:19:34,900 --> 00:19:35,700
politicians'

309
00:19:35,700 --> 00:19:40,740
own beliefs. The battle began in the 1920s when several states

310
00:19:40,740 --> 00:19:44,260
banned the teaching of evolution and it's still going on today

311
00:19:44,260 --> 00:19:48,900
as they try to push creationism into science classes.

312
00:19:48,900 --> 00:19:52,420
It's difficult to know how much this literal belief in creation

313
00:19:52,420 --> 00:19:56,300
is fueling the anti-science movement among American politicians.

314
00:19:56,300 --> 00:20:00,500
I never ascribe motivation because I can't read people's minds

315
00:20:00,620 --> 00:20:05,540
but often they make the link themselves. Todd Akins remarks about rape victims

316
00:20:05,540 --> 00:20:06,740
not getting pregnant

317
00:20:06,740 --> 00:20:10,500
were used to justify refusing abortion to rape victims

318
00:20:10,500 --> 00:20:15,220
and his strong anti-abortion views were in turn shaped by his religion.

319
00:20:15,220 --> 00:20:19,940
This guy who was chairman of the House Committee on Science, Space and Technology

320
00:20:19,940 --> 00:20:24,620
refused to accept that carbon dioxide affects atmospheric temperature because

321
00:20:24,620 --> 00:20:28,020
because we can't control what God

322
00:20:28,340 --> 00:20:31,780
does. Now I've restricted my list to the

323
00:20:31,780 --> 00:20:36,060
English-speaking world and to advanced democracies but you might well ask

324
00:20:36,060 --> 00:20:40,740
why are most of the people on Pottole's list conservative American politicians?

325
00:20:40,740 --> 00:20:45,980
Yes! Good question! I'd like to know the answer to that too.

326
00:20:45,980 --> 00:20:49,020
It's certainly not because Americans are dumb.

327
00:20:49,020 --> 00:20:52,340
After all this is the land of technology and innovation

328
00:20:52,340 --> 00:20:55,620
which has produced some of the greatest scientific minds of our age.

329
00:20:56,340 --> 00:20:59,980
And it's certainly not because conservatives are scientifically illiterate.

330
00:20:59,980 --> 00:21:03,540
Far from it. In other advanced democracies like

331
00:21:03,540 --> 00:21:08,100
Europe and Japan conservatives are just as accepting of scientific conclusions

332
00:21:08,100 --> 00:21:08,400
as

333
00:21:08,400 --> 00:21:13,100
any other part of the political spectrum. I found examples of politicians on the

334
00:21:13,100 --> 00:21:14,780
left fudging the science

335
00:21:14,780 --> 00:21:18,660
that's in my videos but I haven't come across examples of them

336
00:21:18,660 --> 00:21:22,860
refusing to accept the conclusions of researchers or trying to substitute

337
00:21:22,860 --> 00:21:24,300
their own science.

338
00:21:24,780 --> 00:21:28,300
So don't blame me. American conservatives themselves

339
00:21:28,300 --> 00:21:32,240
see this as a battle between liberals, people on the left who accept the

340
00:21:32,240 --> 00:21:33,220
published science

341
00:21:33,220 --> 00:21:35,460
and conservatives who don't.

342
00:21:35,460 --> 00:21:39,660
I've instinctively known this from the get-go from 20 years ago. The whole thing's made up.

343
00:21:39,660 --> 00:21:42,260
And the reason I know it is because liberals are behind it.

344
00:21:42,260 --> 00:21:46,420
Conservapedia thinks evolution, plate tectonics, black holes, dark matter

345
00:21:46,420 --> 00:21:50,460
and just about anything in the realms of science are part of a liberal plot.

346
00:21:50,940 --> 00:21:55,300
For politicians to echo these beliefs, well it's a situation that conservatives

347
00:21:55,300 --> 00:21:55,540
in

348
00:21:55,540 --> 00:22:00,780
other parts of the world find bizarre. Being a conservative means believing in

349
00:22:00,780 --> 00:22:01,840
free markets

350
00:22:01,840 --> 00:22:06,420
and minimising the role of government in the economy. It means defending individual

351
00:22:06,420 --> 00:22:08,520
freedoms from the power of the state.

352
00:22:08,520 --> 00:22:12,060
It means individual responsibility and accountability.

353
00:22:12,060 --> 00:22:16,140
It means a lot of things that have been expounded in conservative creeds

354
00:22:16,140 --> 00:22:19,360
from various think tanks and individuals. It

355
00:22:19,360 --> 00:22:22,480
doesn't mean rejecting scientific conclusions

356
00:22:22,480 --> 00:22:27,640
or making up scientific facts to suit your ideological or religious beliefs.

357
00:22:27,640 --> 00:22:30,520
That's never been a conservative principle.

358
00:22:30,520 --> 00:22:34,780
It could be just a shift on the axis. So here's my advice to American politicians

359
00:22:34,780 --> 00:22:38,400
who don't seem to be on board with the bipartisan approach to science

360
00:22:38,400 --> 00:22:44,080
adopted in other advanced democracies. Your job isn't to do a 30-second crash

361
00:22:44,080 --> 00:22:46,400
course in a complex scientific subject

362
00:22:46,600 --> 00:22:50,360
and when you don't understand it decide to make up your own science instead.

363
00:22:50,360 --> 00:22:53,920
Your job is to decide what policies to implement

364
00:22:53,920 --> 00:22:58,040
based on scientific conclusions that have been published in respected

365
00:22:58,040 --> 00:23:02,880
peer-reviewed scientific journals. And if you don't know what those conclusions are

366
00:23:02,880 --> 00:23:07,160
ask the scientists doing the research or the institutions that have been set up

367
00:23:07,160 --> 00:23:08,480
to do the research

368
00:23:08,480 --> 00:23:12,300
or the National Academy of Sciences that was set up to advise you

369
00:23:12,300 --> 00:23:16,060
what those conclusions are. Don't have a scientific hearing

370
00:23:16,060 --> 00:23:19,980
and call another politician as your only witness.

371
00:23:19,980 --> 00:23:24,540
Don't ask busy researchers for a 30-second crash course in

372
00:23:24,540 --> 00:23:28,980
basic physics so you can decide for yourself whether their conclusions are

373
00:23:28,980 --> 00:23:29,620
right.

374
00:23:29,620 --> 00:23:33,140
But as you sit there in your chair with your data we sit up here

375
00:23:33,140 --> 00:23:36,780
with our data and the constituents and stuff behind us. You don't have the

376
00:23:36,780 --> 00:23:38,380
basic scientific knowledge

377
00:23:38,460 --> 00:23:40,780
or the time to understand it all.

378
00:23:40,780 --> 00:23:45,460
Your job is not to pick and choose which bits of science you want to accept

379
00:23:45,460 --> 00:23:48,580
based on your ideological or religious beliefs.

380
00:23:48,580 --> 00:23:51,620
So if you don't want to impose a carbon tax

381
00:23:51,620 --> 00:23:56,060
then vote against it. Don't use the excuse that the science doesn't make

382
00:23:56,060 --> 00:23:56,940
sense to you

383
00:23:56,940 --> 00:24:01,340
and therefore it must be wrong. And if you want to vote against legalising

384
00:24:01,340 --> 00:24:02,860
abortion for rape victims

385
00:24:02,860 --> 00:24:07,860
then be honest and vote for that. Don't invoke some scientific claptrap about how

386
00:24:07,900 --> 00:24:09,340
women who get pregnant

387
00:24:09,340 --> 00:24:13,460
haven't really been raped. And if you want kids to learn your religious

388
00:24:13,460 --> 00:24:14,100
beliefs

389
00:24:14,100 --> 00:24:17,980
fine! Be honest and vote for a bill that mandates that.

390
00:24:17,980 --> 00:24:21,620
Don't give your religious beliefs some pseudo-scientific title

391
00:24:21,620 --> 00:24:25,700
then pretend scientists are divided over the issue so that both sides need to be

392
00:24:25,700 --> 00:24:26,940
taught in school.

393
00:24:26,940 --> 00:24:31,820
In other words, don't make up your own science or hide behind pseudo-researchers

394
00:24:31,820 --> 00:24:33,540
who've never published their beliefs

395
00:24:33,700 --> 00:24:37,900
simply because real scientific conclusions might lead to a policy you

396
00:24:37,900 --> 00:24:38,620
don't like.
