0	3720	People who purport to speak on behalf of science
3720	7280	and then defend the corruption of science for political gain
7280	11240	need to be exposed as the political demagogues that they are.
11240	15240	And of course I'm talking about Potholer 54.
15240	18520	Political demagogue? Moi? Ooh.
18520	22400	I have to say my channel has always steered well clear of politics
22400	25920	and if I am pushing a political point I'm doing a
25920	30400	pretty shitty job of it because no one seems to know what my politics are.
30400	34480	Several people have taken a guess but they've all been wrong.
34480	38560	The reason I don't proclaim my politics is that this is a channel
38560	42560	about science and far from defending the corruption of science
42560	46680	just about every video I put out is attacking the corruption of science
46680	51560	and so is this one. Now while some of you may think that scientific facts
51560	55280	are dependent on politics, funnily enough they're not.
55320	59000	But of course that doesn't stop politicians from trying to invent
59000	64280	a version of science that fits their own political, religious or ideological preferences.
64280	68920	I'm sure we all remember this famous nugget from Sarah Palin
68920	70800	on the subject of fruit fly research.
70800	76000	Sometimes these dollars they go to projects having little or nothing to do with the public good.
76000	81000	Things like fruit fly research in Paris, France. I kid you not.
81000	85040	Just in case you haven't heard this before, I should point out that fruit flies
85040	89320	are specially bred for studying everything from viruses and diseases
89320	92520	to genetics and medical treatments. It's hard to find
92520	95640	any research more geared towards the public good.
95640	99200	So with that benchmark of stupidity to beat
99200	102440	let's look at some of the stupidest and funniest
102440	105440	scientific conclusions made by politicians.
145040	163560	Yes we are going to start with the low-hanging fruit.
163560	168080	President Robert Mugabe gave us this insight into Zimbabwean politics
168080	172480	when he believed a woman who said she could conjure diesel from a rock.
172920	177360	In 2007 he dispatched three nicely dressed government ministers
177360	180400	to witness a demonstration and sure enough
180400	184440	they reported that it was all true. As you can imagine
184440	187560	crude oil, better yet refined diesel
187560	191680	oozing out of a rock would be the answer to Zimbabwe's fuel shortage.
191680	195560	So according to press reports Mugabe gave the woman a million dollars to
195560	197320	conjure up even more diesel
197320	201200	from other rocks. Now there are two possibilities here.
201600	206760	Either this is a magical process that could turn Zimbabwe into a net exporter
206760	208800	of diesel fuel for the whole continent
208800	213160	or it could be an elaborate hoax with a hole drilled into a rock leading to a
213160	214600	pump and a tank of diesel.
214600	217640	It's a toss-up. Hard to say either way.
217640	221840	Okay, turned out it was a tank of diesel being pumped through a man-made hole but
221840	224560	it could have been the answer to Zimbabwe's fuel shortage
224560	228480	so let's not make a complete donkey's arse out of President Mugabe.
228880	231640	We'll put his magic fuel from rocks idea
231640	236440	quite low on the list. Onto the next one. People outside the United States might
236440	238760	not be familiar with Congressman Todd
238760	243680	Akin who four years ago revealed to the world the amazing science that stops
243680	247240	rape victims getting pregnant. From what I understand from doctors
247240	250560	that's really rare. If it's a legitimate rape
250560	254280	the female body has ways to try to shut that whole thing down. Having failed to
254280	257200	explain the technicalities to one TV journalist
257280	258960	Akin tried it with another.
258960	264160	Stress plays some part in fertility. Perhaps you know some people they wanted
264160	264640	to have a
264640	268600	a child and they couldn't seem to do it so they adopt somebody and then pretty
268600	269160	soon
269160	272480	the woman gets pregnant because there isn't the stress.
272480	277080	Ah, I see. So the medical doctors you're quoting determined that a woman who was under
277080	278640	stress when she got raped
278640	283040	wouldn't get pregnant. Which means that those who did get pregnant either weren't
283040	284000	really raped
284320	288240	they made the whole thing up or they weren't under any stress when they were
288240	288760	raped
288760	293080	in other words they secretly enjoyed it. It's beginning to sound less like
293080	295280	something you learned from a medical study Todd
295280	298760	and more like something you heard in the locker room during football training in
298760	299440	high school.
299440	306440	Are you sure you don't want to have another shot at explaining this
307160	311920	scientific theory? I'm not setting myself up as a medical doctor or anything. Yeah, no shit.
312680	316440	And there are a whole series of studies. Great! Well
316440	319840	off you go and get them while I entertain my subscribers with a popular
319840	322120	selection of London Tea Room dance melodies.
341920	346560	Sorry, I can't wait any longer Todd.
346560	349720	You don't have any medical studies do you?
349720	354840	No, that's what I thought. So let's see if we can track this myth down.
354840	358800	His source was probably an obstetrician called John Wilkie
358800	362920	who first came up with this argument. He's written quite a bit about the
362920	366560	capacity of the female body to shut down a pregnancy when raped
366560	370280	and he told the New York Times how it's done. Now
370280	373640	he's an obstetrician so obviously an expert
373640	377320	and here's his study. An expert and a study.
377320	382960	Potholer I hear you cry. What more do you want? Well as I've pointed out many times
382960	383800	in my videos
383800	387600	science is not determined by the opinions of experts.
387600	392000	It's determined by what's been published in respected peer-reviewed scientific
392000	392640	journals
392640	396760	set against what else has been published in respected peer-reviewed scientific
396760	397360	journals.
397760	400440	And Wilkie doesn't even pass the first hurdle.
400440	404920	He may believe this stuff about spasming fallopian tubes
404920	410160	but belief is not science. He's never published any studies outlining his
410160	411920	research, his methodology,
411920	414960	his experiments, his sample sizes or anything
414960	419400	that would allow peer reviewers and other researchers to evaluate his conclusions.
419400	424560	This study isn't a study. It's something Wilkie published in a book.
425560	429560	Now you know why I'm always banging on about not believing the science you see
429560	430280	in books,
430280	435200	blogs, videos, newspapers and on TV unless they cite peer-reviewed scientific
435200	438080	papers published in respected scientific journals.
438080	442640	You could so easily end up with a jury believing that this nonsense is real
442640	443320	science
443320	447240	and acquitting a rapist on the grounds that his victim got pregnant.
447240	452440	Fortunately Aitken was booted out by voters before his wacky conclusions took
452440	453040	hold.
453440	456160	Thank goodness none of the other ideas on this list
456160	459360	are life-threatening. You see when you ask the question
459360	462400	does HIV cause AIDS?
462400	465880	The question is does a virus
465880	469840	cause a syndrome? Oh damn it South African President Thabo Mbeki
469840	473480	with this statement Mbeki took charge of a government
473480	477000	that promoted herbal remedies to treat people with AIDS
477000	480520	instead of retrovirals that might have saved their lives.
480600	484880	How does a virus cause a syndrome? Well perhaps if you read a medical
484880	488320	textbook or ask someone who's published studies on the subject
488320	492680	you'd find out but no Mbeki was getting his information
492680	497760	from the internet and the blogosphere is full of claims that HIV doesn't cause
497760	498260	AIDS
498260	503040	along with a coterie of experts to back them up. There's Peter Duisberg
503040	507520	a professor of molecular and cell biology and Kary Mullis who won a Nobel
507520	510040	Prize for his work in genetic PCR.
510080	514040	There's a group of doctors in Western Australia none of them believes
514040	519400	HIV causes AIDS. But once again winning a Nobel Prize or being a
519400	520840	distinguished professor
520840	524240	doesn't mean that any sound that emanates from your anal sphincter
524240	527360	must be a pearl of infallible scientific wisdom.
527360	530880	Most of these beliefs don't pass the first hurdle
530880	534920	because they're published in blogs rather than respected peer-reviewed
534920	536200	scientific journals.
536200	539200	And although Duisberg has published papers
539400	543160	they've been drowned out by the wealth of evidence coming from studies that show
543160	543720	a very
543720	548680	clear link between HIV and AIDS. It seemed to me that we could not blame
548680	553400	everything on a single virus. A Harvard study concluded that the South African
553400	556240	government's denial of the HIV AIDS link
556240	560000	led to the deaths of over 300,000 people
560000	565560	who didn't get the treatment they needed. When I was compiling this list I thought
565760	570600	some politician somewhere is going to be dumb enough to repeat the internet myth
570600	573960	that vaccines cause autism. So why not Google
573960	578320	vaccines, autism, politician and see what comes up.
578320	582360	Two and a half years old the child, a beautiful child, went to have the vaccine
582360	586280	and came back and a week later got a tremendous fever
586280	590360	got very very sick, now is autistic. Her little daughter
590360	593880	took that vaccine, that injection
594080	597000	and she suffered from mental retardation thereafter.
597000	603280	Yeah, you see the thing is it's sort of like me saying that last week my son had
603280	604560	the MMR vaccine
604560	608280	and a week later he finished first in the 100 meters race at school.
608280	612200	Obviously that would mean vaccines improve athletic performance.
612200	617400	Cause and effect need a correlation and that means taking large sample sizes
617400	623040	and analyzing statistics. Now there was a peer-reviewed study that purported to
623200	625200	show a link between vaccines and autism
625200	630000	so that passes the first hurdle. But it doesn't get past the second
630000	633800	because it was found to be heavily flawed, it was redacted
633800	637200	and every other study shows no link between the two.
637200	641360	So the only place you'll find this claim is where politicians do most of their
641360	642520	reading on science
642520	648000	which is the internet. I won't go into the details of why this is junk science
648000	650040	because you'll find a complete debunk of this
650040	655520	internet myth on my channel. And while we're on the subject to Michelle Backman
655520	658520	here's something else she had to say about science.
658520	662360	I don't think that it has been established yet as a fact
662360	665680	that global warming is the issue of the day.
665680	669480	One thing that we need to do
669480	674440	is look at the science. Funny because I thought looking at the science was the job of
674440	678880	scientists. It's not the job of politicians to look at the science for a
678920	680120	very good reason.
680120	684200	Very few of them have the time to read through the scientific literature
684200	688160	and even if they did they wouldn't understand it because few of them have
688160	692480	any scientific training at all. If you think I'm wrong just keep watching and
692480	696680	you'll see probably the most woeful examples of politicians trying to play
696680	697600	scientist
697600	702960	and showing just how ignorant they are. As far back as 1863
702960	707360	Congress realised that an understanding of the increasing complexity of science
707440	712440	was slipping beyond its cognitive grasp so it decided to establish an advisory
712440	713840	body of scientists.
713840	717000	It's called the National Academy of Sciences
717000	721360	and it's the Academy's job to explain scientific conclusions published in the
721360	722640	scientific literature
722640	727440	to politicians. But these days politicians don't want to hear that.
727440	731080	They think they're smart enough to figure it all out for themselves
731080	734560	even if that means getting all their information from blogs,
734640	738960	half-remembered junior high school science and going on a crash course in
738960	740320	remedial geology.
740320	743720	There have been these back and forth between
743720	747720	on glaciers and the melting that we've seen over and over again.
747720	754360	Why did it happen then if the same factors that you're blaming it on didn't
754360	755240	exist then?
755240	759720	I can give you as much or as little answers that you would like.
759720	763040	Give me 15 seconds. Okay give me 30 if I may.
763200	766840	Yep, you've got 30 seconds to educate me in a field of science that usually
766840	768520	requires a three-year degree
768520	771600	and a basic understanding of physics which I don't have.
771600	776560	And so Richard Alley has to explain the Milankovitch cycles and the concept of
776560	781240	insulation and positive feedback using his head and his bald spot
781240	784480	to represent the Earth and the South Pole respectively.
784480	789520	And when the 30 seconds is up of course Senator Rohr and Bakker still doesn't
789520	790440	understand it
790520	793320	so it must all be wrong.
793320	796880	Let's leave the remedial class and see how politicians are getting on in the
796880	797720	other class
797720	801200	for those with learning difficulties. I live in Wisconsin.
801200	804960	There were two, I think 200 foot thick glaciers
804960	808160	in Wisconsin. How do you explain
808160	811920	the climate change before man ever had a carbon footprint?
811920	817160	The statement that you just made is blatantly false. How do you explain
817200	820800	climate change that occurred 10,000 years ago before man had a carbon
820800	823920	print? Which is science speak for
823920	829840	are you really that stupid? For anyone who thinks Senator Johnson makes a good
829840	830440	point
830440	833640	listen again. He's not making a point.
833640	837800	He doesn't accept the science so he's asking a question which he thinks will
837800	839480	have these researchers stumped.
839480	843760	If he really wants to know what causes glaciations all he has to do is read a
843760	844760	science book
844760	849360	or have a scientist come to his office and explain it or watch my video on the
849360	854240	800 year lag explained where I show that deglaciation was caused by a wobble in
854240	855320	the Earth's axis.
855320	859480	That caused a small increase in insulation in the southern hemisphere
859480	863640	which led to increased water vapour, lower albedo through melting ice
863640	867200	and the degassing of carbon dioxide which in turn
867200	872120	led to more warming. You're welcome Senator. So who else wants to turn a congressional
872120	874240	hearing into a remedial science lesson
874280	878840	by attempting to stump the teacher? Lead scientist at NASA said this
878840	882880	he said that what ended the ice age was global wobbling.
882880	886040	Is the wobbling of the earth included in any of your modeling?
886040	890200	And the answer was no. When you have a model and you say we're going to leave out the
890200	892760	most important impact of that model
892760	896220	out of our theory and not talk about global
896220	900920	wobbling, how can you make projections? Well Congressman it's like this
901320	905360	Global wobbling or the Milankovitch cycles as they're more commonly known
905360	908520	take place over the course of hundreds of thousands of years.
908520	912200	Their effect in the space of a few decades or a few centuries
912200	915400	is so minimal as to be totally ineffective.
915400	918800	But again Congressman Stockman's complete
918800	922520	ignorance on this subject is a given. It's not the point.
922520	926660	The point is he makes the assumption that the science must be wrong
926780	929300	and he's convinced his questions will have all these
929300	934500	know-it-all scientists stumped. They can't possibly have seen the flaw he spotted.
934500	939980	Oh wait, I've just been told that Stockman has managed to spot an even bigger flaw in the theory.
939980	943860	How long will it take for the sea level to rise two feet?
943860	948940	Think about it, if your ice cube melts in your glass it doesn't overflow, it's displacement.
948940	952500	This is the thing, some of the things that they're talking about mathematically and
952500	953380	scientifically
953380	957060	don't make sense.
957060	960860	I think what you mean Congressman is that they don't make sense to you.
960860	965340	And why should they? You're a politician with a bachelor's degree in accounting.
965340	968540	Don't assume that because it doesn't make sense to you
968540	972620	it doesn't make sense to anyone who studied science past tenth grade.
972620	976120	No, scratch that, even second grade kids understand it.
976120	980420	So it's hardly surprising that research glaciologists and oceanographers
980620	983620	spend their entire professional careers understanding it.
983620	986700	Now there is the teeniest possibility,
986700	990460	about the same odds of diesel coming out of a rock, that in the course of a
990460	995260	hundred years of research not one single oceanographer or glaciologist
995260	999980	realised that ice melting in a glass of water doesn't raise the level of water.
999980	1004740	It's possible Congressman Stockman in his spare time has discovered something
1004740	1006700	completely unknown to science.
1007140	1010820	Or it's possible these oceanographers and glaciologists know something that
1010820	1011900	Stockman doesn't.
1011900	1017180	It's a toss-up. So instead of giving Congress the benefit of his theory
1017180	1020940	it might have been better to go over to the remedial class at the Committee of
1020940	1022780	Science, Space and Technology.
1022780	1027180	And Stockman could have asked why it makes sense to scientists and not to him.
1027180	1030580	He would have been told that melting ice already in the ocean
1030580	1035740	is not the cause of sea level rise. The cause of sea level rise is partly due to
1035780	1039460	ice melting on land and pouring into the oceans
1039460	1044900	to the tune of 150 cubic miles a year and partly due to the thermal expansion
1044900	1045820	of the oceans
1045820	1050500	as they warm up. The problem is that this failure to understand the science
1050500	1054700	not only leads these politicians to conclude that the science must be wrong,
1054700	1058420	they figure that the only way thousands of scientists can be wrong
1058420	1062460	is if they're all in on a conspiracy. And if there's a conspiracy
1062580	1066220	then the politicians can happily ignore the published science and make up their
1066220	1066700	own.
1066700	1071660	It's like a downward vortex of ignorance, stupidity, paranoia
1071660	1077260	and religious conviction. Now you would have thought that Stockman's
1077260	1082020	ice-in-a-glass theory would rank among the stupidest ever uttered by a politician.
1082020	1086180	It's got to be up there but there's a lot of competition.
1086180	1089660	The temperature on Mars is exactly as it is here.
1090060	1094060	Nobody will dispute that.
1094060	1097340	It could be secular. It could be just a shift on the axis.
1097340	1100420	The ice caps are melting which we see over and over again.
1100420	1104900	Yeah, they're melting on Mars too. One would have to say the Great Flood
1104900	1107900	is an example of climate change. Yes, he really
1107900	1110940	is talking about the well-known scientific fact
1110940	1114420	that Noah led all the animals two by two into an arc.
1114420	1119140	This is his crucial piece of evidence that carbon dioxide can't cause
1119140	1121060	atmospheric temperatures to rise.
1121060	1124380	And that certainly wasn't because mankind had overdeveloped
1124380	1129260	hydrocarbon energy. No, it was because an invisible being made it rain for
1129260	1132340	forty days and forty nights and flooded the entire world
1132340	1137140	and by the way left not a trace. Which brings me neatly onto the number one
1137140	1140100	wacky idea politicians have about science
1140100	1144140	that it's all bunk because we were in fact created
1144260	1146220	6,500 years ago.
1146220	1150020	I've come to understand that. All that stuff I was taught about evolution
1150020	1154220	and embryology and big bang theory
1154220	1158220	all that lies straight from the pit of hell.
1158220	1162060	Over the last hundred years geology, astronomy and biology have been under
1162060	1162780	attack
1162780	1166980	by American politicians who want to influence how these subjects are taught.
1166980	1170900	Not according to discoveries and conclusions published in the scientific
1170900	1171580	literature
1171900	1174900	which is how it's done in the rest of the world but according to the
1174900	1175700	politicians'
1175700	1180740	own beliefs. The battle began in the 1920s when several states
1180740	1184260	banned the teaching of evolution and it's still going on today
1184260	1188900	as they try to push creationism into science classes.
1188900	1192420	It's difficult to know how much this literal belief in creation
1192420	1196300	is fueling the anti-science movement among American politicians.
1196300	1200500	I never ascribe motivation because I can't read people's minds
1200620	1205540	but often they make the link themselves. Todd Akins remarks about rape victims
1205540	1206740	not getting pregnant
1206740	1210500	were used to justify refusing abortion to rape victims
1210500	1215220	and his strong anti-abortion views were in turn shaped by his religion.
1215220	1219940	This guy who was chairman of the House Committee on Science, Space and Technology
1219940	1224620	refused to accept that carbon dioxide affects atmospheric temperature because
1224620	1228020	because we can't control what God
1228340	1231780	does. Now I've restricted my list to the
1231780	1236060	English-speaking world and to advanced democracies but you might well ask
1236060	1240740	why are most of the people on Pottole's list conservative American politicians?
1240740	1245980	Yes! Good question! I'd like to know the answer to that too.
1245980	1249020	It's certainly not because Americans are dumb.
1249020	1252340	After all this is the land of technology and innovation
1252340	1255620	which has produced some of the greatest scientific minds of our age.
1256340	1259980	And it's certainly not because conservatives are scientifically illiterate.
1259980	1263540	Far from it. In other advanced democracies like
1263540	1268100	Europe and Japan conservatives are just as accepting of scientific conclusions
1268100	1268400	as
1268400	1273100	any other part of the political spectrum. I found examples of politicians on the
1273100	1274780	left fudging the science
1274780	1278660	that's in my videos but I haven't come across examples of them
1278660	1282860	refusing to accept the conclusions of researchers or trying to substitute
1282860	1284300	their own science.
1284780	1288300	So don't blame me. American conservatives themselves
1288300	1292240	see this as a battle between liberals, people on the left who accept the
1292240	1293220	published science
1293220	1295460	and conservatives who don't.
1295460	1299660	I've instinctively known this from the get-go from 20 years ago. The whole thing's made up.
1299660	1302260	And the reason I know it is because liberals are behind it.
1302260	1306420	Conservapedia thinks evolution, plate tectonics, black holes, dark matter
1306420	1310460	and just about anything in the realms of science are part of a liberal plot.
1310940	1315300	For politicians to echo these beliefs, well it's a situation that conservatives
1315300	1315540	in
1315540	1320780	other parts of the world find bizarre. Being a conservative means believing in
1320780	1321840	free markets
1321840	1326420	and minimising the role of government in the economy. It means defending individual
1326420	1328520	freedoms from the power of the state.
1328520	1332060	It means individual responsibility and accountability.
1332060	1336140	It means a lot of things that have been expounded in conservative creeds
1336140	1339360	from various think tanks and individuals. It
1339360	1342480	doesn't mean rejecting scientific conclusions
1342480	1347640	or making up scientific facts to suit your ideological or religious beliefs.
1347640	1350520	That's never been a conservative principle.
1350520	1354780	It could be just a shift on the axis. So here's my advice to American politicians
1354780	1358400	who don't seem to be on board with the bipartisan approach to science
1358400	1364080	adopted in other advanced democracies. Your job isn't to do a 30-second crash
1364080	1366400	course in a complex scientific subject
1366600	1370360	and when you don't understand it decide to make up your own science instead.
1370360	1373920	Your job is to decide what policies to implement
1373920	1378040	based on scientific conclusions that have been published in respected
1378040	1382880	peer-reviewed scientific journals. And if you don't know what those conclusions are
1382880	1387160	ask the scientists doing the research or the institutions that have been set up
1387160	1388480	to do the research
1388480	1392300	or the National Academy of Sciences that was set up to advise you
1392300	1396060	what those conclusions are. Don't have a scientific hearing
1396060	1399980	and call another politician as your only witness.
1399980	1404540	Don't ask busy researchers for a 30-second crash course in
1404540	1408980	basic physics so you can decide for yourself whether their conclusions are
1408980	1409620	right.
1409620	1413140	But as you sit there in your chair with your data we sit up here
1413140	1416780	with our data and the constituents and stuff behind us. You don't have the
1416780	1418380	basic scientific knowledge
1418460	1420780	or the time to understand it all.
1420780	1425460	Your job is not to pick and choose which bits of science you want to accept
1425460	1428580	based on your ideological or religious beliefs.
1428580	1431620	So if you don't want to impose a carbon tax
1431620	1436060	then vote against it. Don't use the excuse that the science doesn't make
1436060	1436940	sense to you
1436940	1441340	and therefore it must be wrong. And if you want to vote against legalising
1441340	1442860	abortion for rape victims
1442860	1447860	then be honest and vote for that. Don't invoke some scientific claptrap about how
1447900	1449340	women who get pregnant
1449340	1453460	haven't really been raped. And if you want kids to learn your religious
1453460	1454100	beliefs
1454100	1457980	fine! Be honest and vote for a bill that mandates that.
1457980	1461620	Don't give your religious beliefs some pseudo-scientific title
1461620	1465700	then pretend scientists are divided over the issue so that both sides need to be
1465700	1466940	taught in school.
1466940	1471820	In other words, don't make up your own science or hide behind pseudo-researchers
1471820	1473540	who've never published their beliefs
1473700	1477900	simply because real scientific conclusions might lead to a policy you
1477900	1478620	don't like.
