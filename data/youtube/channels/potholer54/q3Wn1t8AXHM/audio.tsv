0	5780	Four hundred million years ago, this was a cauldron of exploding volcanoes and molten
5780	11700	lava. A few million years later, a shallow tropical sea appeared and laid down this bed
11700	17040	of limestone. None of which would really matter to anyone today, except for the fact that
17040	23400	this is Flodden Field, the site of one of the bloodiest battles in British history.
23400	28660	But how did a volcanic eruption four hundred million years ago help defeat one of the strongest
28660	33620	armies ever to invade England? And why did the formation of the Ardennes Mountains in
33620	39620	Belgium cause the death of the King of Scotland and change the course of British history?
58660	87540	In this series, we are going to look at how environments far back in time, millions of
87540	93900	years before humans appeared on Earth affected the outcome of battles and changed human history.
93900	99180	The type of rock an army found itself fighting on was sometimes a matter of design, but often
99180	104100	it was pure chance. And if the right type of environment had laid down the right type
104100	110560	of rock, it gave the underdog an unwitting victory.
110560	115060	The underdog at the Battle of Flodden five hundred years ago was Henry VIII's army of
115060	122500	around 26,000 men. Henry himself wasn't even there. He was off fighting in France and he
122500	127460	left the elderly Earl of Surrey in charge of what remained of his forces in England,
127460	131260	with strict instructions not to trust the Scots.
131260	137540	His potential adversary was James IV, a Renaissance king with a keen interest in science and culture
137540	143740	and an old-fashioned spirit of chivalry. A powerful ruler, James had united Scotland,
143740	148600	founded its navy, encouraged the first printing press and brought culture and prestige to
148600	154580	the nation. He even married Henry VIII's sister and signed a perpetual treaty of peace with
154580	160260	England. But when France came under attack, James felt honour-bound to strike a blow for
160260	167140	the old Scottish-French alliance. He assembled an army of over 30,000 men and crossed the
167140	172180	border here at the River Tweed.
172180	178100	The Scots sacked Norham Castle, the English fortress that overlooks the river. As they
178100	186700	marched south, other castles fell with barely a fight. Then James came up against two things.
186700	196360	One was Henry VIII's home army. The second was some serious Devonian geology.
196360	202060	The Devonian was a period so far back in time you can forget humans. Oh, it was way back
202060	207540	before the dinosaurs and even the animals that evolved into dinosaurs. During the Devonian,
207540	213700	around 400 million years ago, there were no land animals at all. And that wasn't the only
213700	218540	thing that was different about the Devonian period. The geography of the continents was
218540	225780	unrecognisable. Europe was in the tropics. It moves because the pieces of the Earth's
225780	231620	crust are in constant motion, floating on the Earth's upper mantle. Plates of basalt
231620	237760	which make up the ocean submerge under thicker plates made of granite, which are the continents.
237760	243700	As they do so, they melt, creating chains of volcanoes.
243700	248500	But when pieces of continent collide, they can't submerge. Instead, they crumple into
248500	254980	huge mountain ranges and eventually fuse together. For billions of years, these pieces of crust
254980	260380	have been splitting apart, drifting around and colliding.
260380	265740	By the beginning of the Devonian, two of these plates, Eurasia and North America, had crashed
265740	270860	together. As they pushed against each other, they threw up the Caledonian mountains and
270860	276340	forged Scotland. Further south, in the Cheviot Hills, the grinding
276340	282080	of the crustal plates caused enormous friction. Rocks at the base of the crust melted and
282080	286920	pushed their way through fissures to the surface. There they exploded in a cauldron
286920	293360	of ash, gas and molten lava. And this is the result. A thick layer of volcanic
293360	300360	material, heaped onto the barren Earth. Look at it closely and you can see it's a
300360	306640	mixture of ash, rock fragments and other volcanic debris. Sandwiched between layers of lava,
306640	312480	geologists estimate this volcanic material was once two kilometres thick. Towering volcanic
312480	318800	peaks dominated the landscape. So 400 million years ago, this was an enormous
318800	325120	mountain range. But wind, rain, sun and ice have worn the mountains down and as we travel
325120	332120	north-east, the peaks get smaller and lower. Their last gasp is an outlying lump called
332120	340000	Flodden Hill. It's covered in woodland today, but in 1513
340000	345040	this was an exposed volcanic outcrop and when King James saw it, he immediately realised
345040	350400	its potential. The steep scarps facing south would be like a fortress against the advancing
350400	357140	English army. He dug gun emplacements into the side of the hill and waited.
357140	361920	This outcrop on the side of Flodden Hill shows exactly what it's made of. A lava called
361920	370720	andesite, which flowed out of a volcano and then solidified into this solid mass.
370720	376360	But the sheer size of this volcanic outlier proved to be a little too impregnable. The
376360	382440	Earl of Surrey quite sensibly decided he didn't want to attack it.
382440	388720	So he came up with a risky plan. Surrey would lead his army right around Flodden Hill and
388720	398400	face the Scots from the other side. Out of sight he embarked on a two-day forced march.
398400	403160	His exhausted and bedraggled army finally reached its objective at about four o'clock
403160	408600	in the afternoon of the 9th of September. The vanguard of Surrey's army broke cover
408600	414560	here about a mile and a half north of Flodden Hill. James now realised that the English
414560	420520	army was behind him. His supply lines from Scotland had been cut and his line of retreat
420520	426840	blocked. He had no choice but to come down from his natural fortress. He moved his army
426840	432200	to the piece of high ground opposite called Branxton Hill. But what neither he nor Surrey
432200	438540	understood was that each was occupying a completely different type of slope. While the Scots were
438540	444360	still on the andesite, the volcanic rock, the English had set up on a piece of limestone
444360	450080	called cement stone, and that was to make all the difference.
450080	454740	To understand where these cement stone rocks came from, we need to fast forward 50 million
454740	463740	years from when those volcanoes were exploding. The earth looks very different. We're in the
463740	471360	Carboniferous, the next geological period after the Devonian, and a lot has changed.
471360	477120	After the volcanic eruptions stopped, the Cheviot Mountains began to erode. Then at
477120	482820	the beginning of the Carboniferous, sea levels rose, cutting them off. Being on the edge
482820	487240	of this mountain range, Flodden Hill would have been right on the coastline, the tropical
487240	492620	waters lapping up against it. It would have looked something like this. Not exactly how
492620	498840	we think of Northumberland. Tons of sediment were deposited at the bottom of these shallow
498840	504240	seas. Silt and sand washed out from rivers. The crushed shells of tiny marine animals
504240	511800	mixed with mud. The detritus piled up over millions of years. When the sea finally retreated
511800	517040	at the end of the Carboniferous, it left a thick layer of this material behind, collectively
517040	523000	known as the cement stone group. This is an outcrop not far from the battlefield.
523000	528820	You can see that the cement stone has hardened into this concrete-like rock, but it's weathered
528820	535500	into a very permeable material. The water drains away very freely.
535500	541380	In contrast to the impermeable andesite, rainwater drains easily from the cement stone group.
541380	546260	It gushes through cracks in the limestone. It filters into and between the layers of
546260	550740	sandstone. So these were the bedrocks on which our two
550740	557460	armies now squared up. The English troops exhausted after a long forced march. The Scottish
557540	562060	soldiers were rested and eager, and had a commanding position on the volcanic slopes
562060	567180	of Branxton Hill. They also had the unbeatable weapon of the
567180	573740	age, the Swiss pike. The pike was 15, 16 feet long. And you can
573740	580740	imagine, a bit like a porcupine, lots of them together made a formidable weapon. The medieval
581380	588380	version of the tank, with a front of 100 of these pikes moving forward at a steady pace,
590300	597300	they were absolutely unstoppable and devastating. After an artillery exchange, the battle opened
601540	606540	on the left flank, with formations of Scottish pikemen advancing across flat ground to the
606580	613580	west of Branxton Hill, towards Sir Edmund Howard and his 4,000 English foot soldiers.
613900	619060	The English were armed with the much smaller bill, a double-bladed weapon with a hook.
619060	626060	But the landscape easily favoured the pike. In this open country, the Scots charged into
626500	632580	the English lines and scattered them. If this success could be repeated with the other two
632580	638340	pike battalions, the Scots would easily have carried the day. But on the rest of the battlefield,
638340	642820	the geology was different. James IV didn't know it, but the volcanic
642820	648080	andesite under his feet was going to be a problem. And it was compounded by another
648080	655080	geological event he was equally, blissfully unaware of.
655540	659860	To understand it, we have to fast forward through the Carboniferous, through the age
659900	665260	of the dinosaurs, through the Tertiary period, almost right up to the present day in geological
665260	670460	terms. Through all this, the continent of Europe was pushed northwards by crustal plate
670460	677140	movement. Britain left the tropics and migrated to its current position. Now, in its colder,
677140	684140	more northerly latitude, it was hit head on by the Ice Age.
685140	692140	15,000 years ago, all this was buried under an ice sheet one mile thick. That's just
693140	699140	recently in geological terms, which means that the ice has left its mark.
699140	702940	If you've got an eye for these things, the hills and valleys here are full of glacial
702940	708860	clues and features. A huge ice sheet crept down from Scotland, hit the cheviate hills
708860	713940	and deflected to the east. The moving ice carried particles of eroded material in the
713940	719740	form of sand and gravel and churned up the underlying rock into a fine clay. As the Ice
719740	725460	Age ended, it melted, depositing this material on the landscape. And though neither side
725460	731460	could see it, the ice had left its fatal mark on the battlefield. Each slope had been coated
731460	736300	with a different glacial material. So the English began to draw up their formations
736300	741800	on the well-drained cement stone. The Scots marched towards them, on top of the impermeable
741840	747200	volcanic andesite. The retreating glaciers had gifted the English well-drained deposits
747200	753320	of sand and gravel. For the Scots, it had dumped a mucky, thick coating of clay called
753320	760320	till. On 9 September 1513, it began to rain. This had little effect on the English, who
760760	766760	stood firm on the cement stone, which carried the water away. But here on the Scottish side,
766760	772440	the volcanic bedrock trapped water in the coating of glacial clay. While the battalions
772440	777000	of pikes had done well on the left flank, here in the muddy slopes of the centre and
777000	784000	the right, the Scots began to slip and stumble. Slowly they began to break formation.
785200	789600	By the time they reached the bottom of the slope, their lines were already faltering.
789600	794480	And now they met the next obstacle, and this is where a mountain building event in Europe,
794480	801480	millions of years ago, was to seal their fate.
808960	813400	Throughout the Devonian and Carboniferous periods, a series of collisions between crustal
813400	819380	plates was throwing up mountain chains all over Europe. Called the Hercinian orogeny,
819380	824380	it formed the Ardennes in Belgium and the Massif Central in France. It was an event
824380	829140	that took place over hundreds of millions of years, and even today geologists are still
829140	834420	trying to make sense of it. But one thing they do know is that this upheaval caused
834420	838780	rocks in outlying areas to crack.
838780	843300	The cracks, called faults, run for several miles, and half a dozen can be found in the
843300	848020	Cheviot Hills. Each fault was heralded by an earthquake.
848020	853260	And this is Flodden Fault, running right through the middle of the battlefield. It separated
853260	859260	the Scots from the English. A series of earthquakes thrust up these andesites and pushed them
859260	864940	hard up against the cement stone. And it was this fault line that was to seal the fate
864940	867220	of the Scottish battalions.
867220	874060	This big fault system, which juxtaposes the younger cement stones of the Carboniferous
874060	881060	against the Devonian volcanics, that has moved the rocks on either side into that position,
882840	888020	such that subsequently, when they've weathered and eroded, you've now got this great topographic
888020	889240	difference.
889240	894180	The topographic difference washed tonnes of eroded material into the newly created gash
894180	900060	in the earth, forming a deep, boggy sump. The charge of the Scottish pike formations,
900060	905180	already disrupted by the wet clay till and the badly drained andesite slope, hit the
905180	910700	sticky bog of the fault line and began to break apart.
910700	917700	The pikes? Unstoppable. Formidable. Whilst they're in motion.
918500	925500	Unfortunately for the Scots, on the steeper part of Brankson Hill, suddenly the front
928980	934260	ranks were knee deep in mud, which slowed them down. The ranks behind piled on top of
934260	941260	them, complete confusion, and as they were no longer moving, they were suddenly a target.
942260	946940	Then the English bills had a go.
946940	953940	It has a point for stabbing and jabbing, it has, this one has another point for hacking
955980	962980	into armour, into a helmet, and it also has this deadly hook for grabbing the back of
963780	970500	the knee, or eye-wateringly, up and under.
970500	977500	It also has this axe-type blade here. This is a fearsome weapon.
977500	984500	From what had seemed almost certain victory, the Scots were now, incredibly, facing likely
984500	991500	defeat. Their only hope was a battalion of Highlanders held in reserve on the right flank.
1008020	1013860	But a Highland charge was stopped in its tracks by a breakaway detachment of English archers.
1013860	1018900	The Highlanders, thinking they'd been outflanked by a much larger contingent of Surrey's army,
1018900	1021860	broke off their charge and fled.
1021860	1027300	James was now desperately fighting on foot, alongside his men, their ranks broken, their
1027300	1033300	weapons useless, and surrounded on all sides. An arrow was shot through his mouth, and then
1033300	1040060	an unearned English soldier sliced his throat with a bill. James died along with his son,
1040060	1047060	eight earls and thirteen barons. The cream of Scottish nobility, a generation of leaders,
1047260	1054260	was wiped out.
1054260	1061260	Every year on the anniversary of the battle, a commemoration takes place at the Flodden
1073260	1080020	Monument overlooking the battle site. This is very much a Scottish affair. While in England
1080020	1084900	the Battle of Flodden is largely forgotten, for the Scots it's a significant and wrenching
1084900	1091180	piece of history. What could have been a golden age of Scottish Renaissance ended abruptly
1091180	1093700	and catastrophically.
1093700	1100700	Before the Battle of Flodden, Scotland was a very prosperous nation. James IV founded
1101580	1108100	universities, he looked after his people, and he was the most popular king Scotland
1108100	1115100	ever had, and then it all finished here. Within a hundred years, Scotland was united
1116580	1120800	with England, the crowns were united.
1120800	1126420	Battles are rarely decided by one factor alone. If James had been less impetuous, if the Highlanders
1126420	1131380	had charged earlier, the Scots might have carried the day. But the early Scottish success
1131380	1136500	on the left flank showed that what ultimately defeated them were geological events they
1136540	1139860	never even knew had happened.
1139860	1145360	The events three or four hundred million years ago have dictated the nature of the lithology,
1145360	1152360	the rocks beneath our feet at that particular point. And also not just the depositional
1153820	1160820	and environmental effects of that time, but the subsequent earth movements.
1161540	1168540	Geology sleeps underground. It only gets our attention when new disasters hit the headlines,
1168700	1175700	earthquakes, landslides, tsunami. But events that occurred far back in time are just disasters
1175780	1182780	lying in wait. A volcanic eruption that no one saw, an earthquake no one felt, an ice
1184420	1190040	sheet that came and went while our ancestors were still migrating out of Africa. All these
1190040	1197040	events have been waiting for their date with history.
