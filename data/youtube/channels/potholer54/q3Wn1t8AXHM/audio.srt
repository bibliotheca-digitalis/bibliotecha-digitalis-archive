1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,780
Four hundred million years ago, this was a cauldron of exploding volcanoes and molten

2
00:00:05,780 --> 00:00:11,700
lava. A few million years later, a shallow tropical sea appeared and laid down this bed

3
00:00:11,700 --> 00:00:17,040
of limestone. None of which would really matter to anyone today, except for the fact that

4
00:00:17,040 --> 00:00:23,400
this is Flodden Field, the site of one of the bloodiest battles in British history.

5
00:00:23,400 --> 00:00:28,660
But how did a volcanic eruption four hundred million years ago help defeat one of the strongest

6
00:00:28,660 --> 00:00:33,620
armies ever to invade England? And why did the formation of the Ardennes Mountains in

7
00:00:33,620 --> 00:00:39,620
Belgium cause the death of the King of Scotland and change the course of British history?

8
00:00:58,660 --> 00:01:27,540
In this series, we are going to look at how environments far back in time, millions of

9
00:01:27,540 --> 00:01:33,900
years before humans appeared on Earth affected the outcome of battles and changed human history.

10
00:01:33,900 --> 00:01:39,180
The type of rock an army found itself fighting on was sometimes a matter of design, but often

11
00:01:39,180 --> 00:01:44,100
it was pure chance. And if the right type of environment had laid down the right type

12
00:01:44,100 --> 00:01:50,560
of rock, it gave the underdog an unwitting victory.

13
00:01:50,560 --> 00:01:55,060
The underdog at the Battle of Flodden five hundred years ago was Henry VIII's army of

14
00:01:55,060 --> 00:02:02,500
around 26,000 men. Henry himself wasn't even there. He was off fighting in France and he

15
00:02:02,500 --> 00:02:07,460
left the elderly Earl of Surrey in charge of what remained of his forces in England,

16
00:02:07,460 --> 00:02:11,260
with strict instructions not to trust the Scots.

17
00:02:11,260 --> 00:02:17,540
His potential adversary was James IV, a Renaissance king with a keen interest in science and culture

18
00:02:17,540 --> 00:02:23,740
and an old-fashioned spirit of chivalry. A powerful ruler, James had united Scotland,

19
00:02:23,740 --> 00:02:28,600
founded its navy, encouraged the first printing press and brought culture and prestige to

20
00:02:28,600 --> 00:02:34,580
the nation. He even married Henry VIII's sister and signed a perpetual treaty of peace with

21
00:02:34,580 --> 00:02:40,260
England. But when France came under attack, James felt honour-bound to strike a blow for

22
00:02:40,260 --> 00:02:47,140
the old Scottish-French alliance. He assembled an army of over 30,000 men and crossed the

23
00:02:47,140 --> 00:02:52,180
border here at the River Tweed.

24
00:02:52,180 --> 00:02:58,100
The Scots sacked Norham Castle, the English fortress that overlooks the river. As they

25
00:02:58,100 --> 00:03:06,700
marched south, other castles fell with barely a fight. Then James came up against two things.

26
00:03:06,700 --> 00:03:16,360
One was Henry VIII's home army. The second was some serious Devonian geology.

27
00:03:16,360 --> 00:03:22,060
The Devonian was a period so far back in time you can forget humans. Oh, it was way back

28
00:03:22,060 --> 00:03:27,540
before the dinosaurs and even the animals that evolved into dinosaurs. During the Devonian,

29
00:03:27,540 --> 00:03:33,700
around 400 million years ago, there were no land animals at all. And that wasn't the only

30
00:03:33,700 --> 00:03:38,540
thing that was different about the Devonian period. The geography of the continents was

31
00:03:38,540 --> 00:03:45,780
unrecognisable. Europe was in the tropics. It moves because the pieces of the Earth's

32
00:03:45,780 --> 00:03:51,620
crust are in constant motion, floating on the Earth's upper mantle. Plates of basalt

33
00:03:51,620 --> 00:03:57,760
which make up the ocean submerge under thicker plates made of granite, which are the continents.

34
00:03:57,760 --> 00:04:03,700
As they do so, they melt, creating chains of volcanoes.

35
00:04:03,700 --> 00:04:08,500
But when pieces of continent collide, they can't submerge. Instead, they crumple into

36
00:04:08,500 --> 00:04:14,980
huge mountain ranges and eventually fuse together. For billions of years, these pieces of crust

37
00:04:14,980 --> 00:04:20,380
have been splitting apart, drifting around and colliding.

38
00:04:20,380 --> 00:04:25,740
By the beginning of the Devonian, two of these plates, Eurasia and North America, had crashed

39
00:04:25,740 --> 00:04:30,860
together. As they pushed against each other, they threw up the Caledonian mountains and

40
00:04:30,860 --> 00:04:36,340
forged Scotland. Further south, in the Cheviot Hills, the grinding

41
00:04:36,340 --> 00:04:42,080
of the crustal plates caused enormous friction. Rocks at the base of the crust melted and

42
00:04:42,080 --> 00:04:46,920
pushed their way through fissures to the surface. There they exploded in a cauldron

43
00:04:46,920 --> 00:04:53,360
of ash, gas and molten lava. And this is the result. A thick layer of volcanic

44
00:04:53,360 --> 00:05:00,360
material, heaped onto the barren Earth. Look at it closely and you can see it's a

45
00:05:00,360 --> 00:05:06,640
mixture of ash, rock fragments and other volcanic debris. Sandwiched between layers of lava,

46
00:05:06,640 --> 00:05:12,480
geologists estimate this volcanic material was once two kilometres thick. Towering volcanic

47
00:05:12,480 --> 00:05:18,800
peaks dominated the landscape. So 400 million years ago, this was an enormous

48
00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:25,120
mountain range. But wind, rain, sun and ice have worn the mountains down and as we travel

49
00:05:25,120 --> 00:05:32,120
north-east, the peaks get smaller and lower. Their last gasp is an outlying lump called

50
00:05:32,120 --> 00:05:40,000
Flodden Hill. It's covered in woodland today, but in 1513

51
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:45,040
this was an exposed volcanic outcrop and when King James saw it, he immediately realised

52
00:05:45,040 --> 00:05:50,400
its potential. The steep scarps facing south would be like a fortress against the advancing

53
00:05:50,400 --> 00:05:57,140
English army. He dug gun emplacements into the side of the hill and waited.

54
00:05:57,140 --> 00:06:01,920
This outcrop on the side of Flodden Hill shows exactly what it's made of. A lava called

55
00:06:01,920 --> 00:06:10,720
andesite, which flowed out of a volcano and then solidified into this solid mass.

56
00:06:10,720 --> 00:06:16,360
But the sheer size of this volcanic outlier proved to be a little too impregnable. The

57
00:06:16,360 --> 00:06:22,440
Earl of Surrey quite sensibly decided he didn't want to attack it.

58
00:06:22,440 --> 00:06:28,720
So he came up with a risky plan. Surrey would lead his army right around Flodden Hill and

59
00:06:28,720 --> 00:06:38,400
face the Scots from the other side. Out of sight he embarked on a two-day forced march.

60
00:06:38,400 --> 00:06:43,160
His exhausted and bedraggled army finally reached its objective at about four o'clock

61
00:06:43,160 --> 00:06:48,600
in the afternoon of the 9th of September. The vanguard of Surrey's army broke cover

62
00:06:48,600 --> 00:06:54,560
here about a mile and a half north of Flodden Hill. James now realised that the English

63
00:06:54,560 --> 00:07:00,520
army was behind him. His supply lines from Scotland had been cut and his line of retreat

64
00:07:00,520 --> 00:07:06,840
blocked. He had no choice but to come down from his natural fortress. He moved his army

65
00:07:06,840 --> 00:07:12,200
to the piece of high ground opposite called Branxton Hill. But what neither he nor Surrey

66
00:07:12,200 --> 00:07:18,540
understood was that each was occupying a completely different type of slope. While the Scots were

67
00:07:18,540 --> 00:07:24,360
still on the andesite, the volcanic rock, the English had set up on a piece of limestone

68
00:07:24,360 --> 00:07:30,080
called cement stone, and that was to make all the difference.

69
00:07:30,080 --> 00:07:34,740
To understand where these cement stone rocks came from, we need to fast forward 50 million

70
00:07:34,740 --> 00:07:43,740
years from when those volcanoes were exploding. The earth looks very different. We're in the

71
00:07:43,740 --> 00:07:51,360
Carboniferous, the next geological period after the Devonian, and a lot has changed.

72
00:07:51,360 --> 00:07:57,120
After the volcanic eruptions stopped, the Cheviot Mountains began to erode. Then at

73
00:07:57,120 --> 00:08:02,820
the beginning of the Carboniferous, sea levels rose, cutting them off. Being on the edge

74
00:08:02,820 --> 00:08:07,240
of this mountain range, Flodden Hill would have been right on the coastline, the tropical

75
00:08:07,240 --> 00:08:12,620
waters lapping up against it. It would have looked something like this. Not exactly how

76
00:08:12,620 --> 00:08:18,840
we think of Northumberland. Tons of sediment were deposited at the bottom of these shallow

77
00:08:18,840 --> 00:08:24,240
seas. Silt and sand washed out from rivers. The crushed shells of tiny marine animals

78
00:08:24,240 --> 00:08:31,800
mixed with mud. The detritus piled up over millions of years. When the sea finally retreated

79
00:08:31,800 --> 00:08:37,040
at the end of the Carboniferous, it left a thick layer of this material behind, collectively

80
00:08:37,040 --> 00:08:43,000
known as the cement stone group. This is an outcrop not far from the battlefield.

81
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:48,820
You can see that the cement stone has hardened into this concrete-like rock, but it's weathered

82
00:08:48,820 --> 00:08:55,500
into a very permeable material. The water drains away very freely.

83
00:08:55,500 --> 00:09:01,380
In contrast to the impermeable andesite, rainwater drains easily from the cement stone group.

84
00:09:01,380 --> 00:09:06,260
It gushes through cracks in the limestone. It filters into and between the layers of

85
00:09:06,260 --> 00:09:10,740
sandstone. So these were the bedrocks on which our two

86
00:09:10,740 --> 00:09:17,460
armies now squared up. The English troops exhausted after a long forced march. The Scottish

87
00:09:17,540 --> 00:09:22,060
soldiers were rested and eager, and had a commanding position on the volcanic slopes

88
00:09:22,060 --> 00:09:27,180
of Branxton Hill. They also had the unbeatable weapon of the

89
00:09:27,180 --> 00:09:33,740
age, the Swiss pike. The pike was 15, 16 feet long. And you can

90
00:09:33,740 --> 00:09:40,740
imagine, a bit like a porcupine, lots of them together made a formidable weapon. The medieval

91
00:09:41,380 --> 00:09:48,380
version of the tank, with a front of 100 of these pikes moving forward at a steady pace,

92
00:09:50,300 --> 00:09:57,300
they were absolutely unstoppable and devastating. After an artillery exchange, the battle opened

93
00:10:01,540 --> 00:10:06,540
on the left flank, with formations of Scottish pikemen advancing across flat ground to the

94
00:10:06,580 --> 00:10:13,580
west of Branxton Hill, towards Sir Edmund Howard and his 4,000 English foot soldiers.

95
00:10:13,900 --> 00:10:19,060
The English were armed with the much smaller bill, a double-bladed weapon with a hook.

96
00:10:19,060 --> 00:10:26,060
But the landscape easily favoured the pike. In this open country, the Scots charged into

97
00:10:26,500 --> 00:10:32,580
the English lines and scattered them. If this success could be repeated with the other two

98
00:10:32,580 --> 00:10:38,340
pike battalions, the Scots would easily have carried the day. But on the rest of the battlefield,

99
00:10:38,340 --> 00:10:42,820
the geology was different. James IV didn't know it, but the volcanic

100
00:10:42,820 --> 00:10:48,080
andesite under his feet was going to be a problem. And it was compounded by another

101
00:10:48,080 --> 00:10:55,080
geological event he was equally, blissfully unaware of.

102
00:10:55,540 --> 00:10:59,860
To understand it, we have to fast forward through the Carboniferous, through the age

103
00:10:59,900 --> 00:11:05,260
of the dinosaurs, through the Tertiary period, almost right up to the present day in geological

104
00:11:05,260 --> 00:11:10,460
terms. Through all this, the continent of Europe was pushed northwards by crustal plate

105
00:11:10,460 --> 00:11:17,140
movement. Britain left the tropics and migrated to its current position. Now, in its colder,

106
00:11:17,140 --> 00:11:24,140
more northerly latitude, it was hit head on by the Ice Age.

107
00:11:25,140 --> 00:11:32,140
15,000 years ago, all this was buried under an ice sheet one mile thick. That's just

108
00:11:33,140 --> 00:11:39,140
recently in geological terms, which means that the ice has left its mark.

109
00:11:39,140 --> 00:11:42,940
If you've got an eye for these things, the hills and valleys here are full of glacial

110
00:11:42,940 --> 00:11:48,860
clues and features. A huge ice sheet crept down from Scotland, hit the cheviate hills

111
00:11:48,860 --> 00:11:53,940
and deflected to the east. The moving ice carried particles of eroded material in the

112
00:11:53,940 --> 00:11:59,740
form of sand and gravel and churned up the underlying rock into a fine clay. As the Ice

113
00:11:59,740 --> 00:12:05,460
Age ended, it melted, depositing this material on the landscape. And though neither side

114
00:12:05,460 --> 00:12:11,460
could see it, the ice had left its fatal mark on the battlefield. Each slope had been coated

115
00:12:11,460 --> 00:12:16,300
with a different glacial material. So the English began to draw up their formations

116
00:12:16,300 --> 00:12:21,800
on the well-drained cement stone. The Scots marched towards them, on top of the impermeable

117
00:12:21,840 --> 00:12:27,200
volcanic andesite. The retreating glaciers had gifted the English well-drained deposits

118
00:12:27,200 --> 00:12:33,320
of sand and gravel. For the Scots, it had dumped a mucky, thick coating of clay called

119
00:12:33,320 --> 00:12:40,320
till. On 9 September 1513, it began to rain. This had little effect on the English, who

120
00:12:40,760 --> 00:12:46,760
stood firm on the cement stone, which carried the water away. But here on the Scottish side,

121
00:12:46,760 --> 00:12:52,440
the volcanic bedrock trapped water in the coating of glacial clay. While the battalions

122
00:12:52,440 --> 00:12:57,000
of pikes had done well on the left flank, here in the muddy slopes of the centre and

123
00:12:57,000 --> 00:13:04,000
the right, the Scots began to slip and stumble. Slowly they began to break formation.

124
00:13:05,200 --> 00:13:09,600
By the time they reached the bottom of the slope, their lines were already faltering.

125
00:13:09,600 --> 00:13:14,480
And now they met the next obstacle, and this is where a mountain building event in Europe,

126
00:13:14,480 --> 00:13:21,480
millions of years ago, was to seal their fate.

127
00:13:28,960 --> 00:13:33,400
Throughout the Devonian and Carboniferous periods, a series of collisions between crustal

128
00:13:33,400 --> 00:13:39,380
plates was throwing up mountain chains all over Europe. Called the Hercinian orogeny,

129
00:13:39,380 --> 00:13:44,380
it formed the Ardennes in Belgium and the Massif Central in France. It was an event

130
00:13:44,380 --> 00:13:49,140
that took place over hundreds of millions of years, and even today geologists are still

131
00:13:49,140 --> 00:13:54,420
trying to make sense of it. But one thing they do know is that this upheaval caused

132
00:13:54,420 --> 00:13:58,780
rocks in outlying areas to crack.

133
00:13:58,780 --> 00:14:03,300
The cracks, called faults, run for several miles, and half a dozen can be found in the

134
00:14:03,300 --> 00:14:08,020
Cheviot Hills. Each fault was heralded by an earthquake.

135
00:14:08,020 --> 00:14:13,260
And this is Flodden Fault, running right through the middle of the battlefield. It separated

136
00:14:13,260 --> 00:14:19,260
the Scots from the English. A series of earthquakes thrust up these andesites and pushed them

137
00:14:19,260 --> 00:14:24,940
hard up against the cement stone. And it was this fault line that was to seal the fate

138
00:14:24,940 --> 00:14:27,220
of the Scottish battalions.

139
00:14:27,220 --> 00:14:34,060
This big fault system, which juxtaposes the younger cement stones of the Carboniferous

140
00:14:34,060 --> 00:14:41,060
against the Devonian volcanics, that has moved the rocks on either side into that position,

141
00:14:42,840 --> 00:14:48,020
such that subsequently, when they've weathered and eroded, you've now got this great topographic

142
00:14:48,020 --> 00:14:49,240
difference.

143
00:14:49,240 --> 00:14:54,180
The topographic difference washed tonnes of eroded material into the newly created gash

144
00:14:54,180 --> 00:15:00,060
in the earth, forming a deep, boggy sump. The charge of the Scottish pike formations,

145
00:15:00,060 --> 00:15:05,180
already disrupted by the wet clay till and the badly drained andesite slope, hit the

146
00:15:05,180 --> 00:15:10,700
sticky bog of the fault line and began to break apart.

147
00:15:10,700 --> 00:15:17,700
The pikes? Unstoppable. Formidable. Whilst they're in motion.

148
00:15:18,500 --> 00:15:25,500
Unfortunately for the Scots, on the steeper part of Brankson Hill, suddenly the front

149
00:15:28,980 --> 00:15:34,260
ranks were knee deep in mud, which slowed them down. The ranks behind piled on top of

150
00:15:34,260 --> 00:15:41,260
them, complete confusion, and as they were no longer moving, they were suddenly a target.

151
00:15:42,260 --> 00:15:46,940
Then the English bills had a go.

152
00:15:46,940 --> 00:15:53,940
It has a point for stabbing and jabbing, it has, this one has another point for hacking

153
00:15:55,980 --> 00:16:02,980
into armour, into a helmet, and it also has this deadly hook for grabbing the back of

154
00:16:03,780 --> 00:16:10,500
the knee, or eye-wateringly, up and under.

155
00:16:10,500 --> 00:16:17,500
It also has this axe-type blade here. This is a fearsome weapon.

156
00:16:17,500 --> 00:16:24,500
From what had seemed almost certain victory, the Scots were now, incredibly, facing likely

157
00:16:24,500 --> 00:16:31,500
defeat. Their only hope was a battalion of Highlanders held in reserve on the right flank.

158
00:16:48,020 --> 00:16:53,860
But a Highland charge was stopped in its tracks by a breakaway detachment of English archers.

159
00:16:53,860 --> 00:16:58,900
The Highlanders, thinking they'd been outflanked by a much larger contingent of Surrey's army,

160
00:16:58,900 --> 00:17:01,860
broke off their charge and fled.

161
00:17:01,860 --> 00:17:07,300
James was now desperately fighting on foot, alongside his men, their ranks broken, their

162
00:17:07,300 --> 00:17:13,300
weapons useless, and surrounded on all sides. An arrow was shot through his mouth, and then

163
00:17:13,300 --> 00:17:20,060
an unearned English soldier sliced his throat with a bill. James died along with his son,

164
00:17:20,060 --> 00:17:27,060
eight earls and thirteen barons. The cream of Scottish nobility, a generation of leaders,

165
00:17:27,260 --> 00:17:34,260
was wiped out.

166
00:17:34,260 --> 00:17:41,260
Every year on the anniversary of the battle, a commemoration takes place at the Flodden

167
00:17:53,260 --> 00:18:00,020
Monument overlooking the battle site. This is very much a Scottish affair. While in England

168
00:18:00,020 --> 00:18:04,900
the Battle of Flodden is largely forgotten, for the Scots it's a significant and wrenching

169
00:18:04,900 --> 00:18:11,180
piece of history. What could have been a golden age of Scottish Renaissance ended abruptly

170
00:18:11,180 --> 00:18:13,700
and catastrophically.

171
00:18:13,700 --> 00:18:20,700
Before the Battle of Flodden, Scotland was a very prosperous nation. James IV founded

172
00:18:21,580 --> 00:18:28,100
universities, he looked after his people, and he was the most popular king Scotland

173
00:18:28,100 --> 00:18:35,100
ever had, and then it all finished here. Within a hundred years, Scotland was united

174
00:18:36,580 --> 00:18:40,800
with England, the crowns were united.

175
00:18:40,800 --> 00:18:46,420
Battles are rarely decided by one factor alone. If James had been less impetuous, if the Highlanders

176
00:18:46,420 --> 00:18:51,380
had charged earlier, the Scots might have carried the day. But the early Scottish success

177
00:18:51,380 --> 00:18:56,500
on the left flank showed that what ultimately defeated them were geological events they

178
00:18:56,540 --> 00:18:59,860
never even knew had happened.

179
00:18:59,860 --> 00:19:05,360
The events three or four hundred million years ago have dictated the nature of the lithology,

180
00:19:05,360 --> 00:19:12,360
the rocks beneath our feet at that particular point. And also not just the depositional

181
00:19:13,820 --> 00:19:20,820
and environmental effects of that time, but the subsequent earth movements.

182
00:19:21,540 --> 00:19:28,540
Geology sleeps underground. It only gets our attention when new disasters hit the headlines,

183
00:19:28,700 --> 00:19:35,700
earthquakes, landslides, tsunami. But events that occurred far back in time are just disasters

184
00:19:35,780 --> 00:19:42,780
lying in wait. A volcanic eruption that no one saw, an earthquake no one felt, an ice

185
00:19:44,420 --> 00:19:50,040
sheet that came and went while our ancestors were still migrating out of Africa. All these

186
00:19:50,040 --> 00:19:57,040
events have been waiting for their date with history.
