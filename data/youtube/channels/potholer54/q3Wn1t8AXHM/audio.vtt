00:00.000 --> 00:05.780
Four hundred million years ago, this was a cauldron of exploding volcanoes and molten

00:05.780 --> 00:11.700
lava. A few million years later, a shallow tropical sea appeared and laid down this bed

00:11.700 --> 00:17.040
of limestone. None of which would really matter to anyone today, except for the fact that

00:17.040 --> 00:23.400
this is Flodden Field, the site of one of the bloodiest battles in British history.

00:23.400 --> 00:28.660
But how did a volcanic eruption four hundred million years ago help defeat one of the strongest

00:28.660 --> 00:33.620
armies ever to invade England? And why did the formation of the Ardennes Mountains in

00:33.620 --> 00:39.620
Belgium cause the death of the King of Scotland and change the course of British history?

00:58.660 --> 01:27.540
In this series, we are going to look at how environments far back in time, millions of

01:27.540 --> 01:33.900
years before humans appeared on Earth affected the outcome of battles and changed human history.

01:33.900 --> 01:39.180
The type of rock an army found itself fighting on was sometimes a matter of design, but often

01:39.180 --> 01:44.100
it was pure chance. And if the right type of environment had laid down the right type

01:44.100 --> 01:50.560
of rock, it gave the underdog an unwitting victory.

01:50.560 --> 01:55.060
The underdog at the Battle of Flodden five hundred years ago was Henry VIII's army of

01:55.060 --> 02:02.500
around 26,000 men. Henry himself wasn't even there. He was off fighting in France and he

02:02.500 --> 02:07.460
left the elderly Earl of Surrey in charge of what remained of his forces in England,

02:07.460 --> 02:11.260
with strict instructions not to trust the Scots.

02:11.260 --> 02:17.540
His potential adversary was James IV, a Renaissance king with a keen interest in science and culture

02:17.540 --> 02:23.740
and an old-fashioned spirit of chivalry. A powerful ruler, James had united Scotland,

02:23.740 --> 02:28.600
founded its navy, encouraged the first printing press and brought culture and prestige to

02:28.600 --> 02:34.580
the nation. He even married Henry VIII's sister and signed a perpetual treaty of peace with

02:34.580 --> 02:40.260
England. But when France came under attack, James felt honour-bound to strike a blow for

02:40.260 --> 02:47.140
the old Scottish-French alliance. He assembled an army of over 30,000 men and crossed the

02:47.140 --> 02:52.180
border here at the River Tweed.

02:52.180 --> 02:58.100
The Scots sacked Norham Castle, the English fortress that overlooks the river. As they

02:58.100 --> 03:06.700
marched south, other castles fell with barely a fight. Then James came up against two things.

03:06.700 --> 03:16.360
One was Henry VIII's home army. The second was some serious Devonian geology.

03:16.360 --> 03:22.060
The Devonian was a period so far back in time you can forget humans. Oh, it was way back

03:22.060 --> 03:27.540
before the dinosaurs and even the animals that evolved into dinosaurs. During the Devonian,

03:27.540 --> 03:33.700
around 400 million years ago, there were no land animals at all. And that wasn't the only

03:33.700 --> 03:38.540
thing that was different about the Devonian period. The geography of the continents was

03:38.540 --> 03:45.780
unrecognisable. Europe was in the tropics. It moves because the pieces of the Earth's

03:45.780 --> 03:51.620
crust are in constant motion, floating on the Earth's upper mantle. Plates of basalt

03:51.620 --> 03:57.760
which make up the ocean submerge under thicker plates made of granite, which are the continents.

03:57.760 --> 04:03.700
As they do so, they melt, creating chains of volcanoes.

04:03.700 --> 04:08.500
But when pieces of continent collide, they can't submerge. Instead, they crumple into

04:08.500 --> 04:14.980
huge mountain ranges and eventually fuse together. For billions of years, these pieces of crust

04:14.980 --> 04:20.380
have been splitting apart, drifting around and colliding.

04:20.380 --> 04:25.740
By the beginning of the Devonian, two of these plates, Eurasia and North America, had crashed

04:25.740 --> 04:30.860
together. As they pushed against each other, they threw up the Caledonian mountains and

04:30.860 --> 04:36.340
forged Scotland. Further south, in the Cheviot Hills, the grinding

04:36.340 --> 04:42.080
of the crustal plates caused enormous friction. Rocks at the base of the crust melted and

04:42.080 --> 04:46.920
pushed their way through fissures to the surface. There they exploded in a cauldron

04:46.920 --> 04:53.360
of ash, gas and molten lava. And this is the result. A thick layer of volcanic

04:53.360 --> 05:00.360
material, heaped onto the barren Earth. Look at it closely and you can see it's a

05:00.360 --> 05:06.640
mixture of ash, rock fragments and other volcanic debris. Sandwiched between layers of lava,

05:06.640 --> 05:12.480
geologists estimate this volcanic material was once two kilometres thick. Towering volcanic

05:12.480 --> 05:18.800
peaks dominated the landscape. So 400 million years ago, this was an enormous

05:18.800 --> 05:25.120
mountain range. But wind, rain, sun and ice have worn the mountains down and as we travel

05:25.120 --> 05:32.120
north-east, the peaks get smaller and lower. Their last gasp is an outlying lump called

05:32.120 --> 05:40.000
Flodden Hill. It's covered in woodland today, but in 1513

05:40.000 --> 05:45.040
this was an exposed volcanic outcrop and when King James saw it, he immediately realised

05:45.040 --> 05:50.400
its potential. The steep scarps facing south would be like a fortress against the advancing

05:50.400 --> 05:57.140
English army. He dug gun emplacements into the side of the hill and waited.

05:57.140 --> 06:01.920
This outcrop on the side of Flodden Hill shows exactly what it's made of. A lava called

06:01.920 --> 06:10.720
andesite, which flowed out of a volcano and then solidified into this solid mass.

06:10.720 --> 06:16.360
But the sheer size of this volcanic outlier proved to be a little too impregnable. The

06:16.360 --> 06:22.440
Earl of Surrey quite sensibly decided he didn't want to attack it.

06:22.440 --> 06:28.720
So he came up with a risky plan. Surrey would lead his army right around Flodden Hill and

06:28.720 --> 06:38.400
face the Scots from the other side. Out of sight he embarked on a two-day forced march.

06:38.400 --> 06:43.160
His exhausted and bedraggled army finally reached its objective at about four o'clock

06:43.160 --> 06:48.600
in the afternoon of the 9th of September. The vanguard of Surrey's army broke cover

06:48.600 --> 06:54.560
here about a mile and a half north of Flodden Hill. James now realised that the English

06:54.560 --> 07:00.520
army was behind him. His supply lines from Scotland had been cut and his line of retreat

07:00.520 --> 07:06.840
blocked. He had no choice but to come down from his natural fortress. He moved his army

07:06.840 --> 07:12.200
to the piece of high ground opposite called Branxton Hill. But what neither he nor Surrey

07:12.200 --> 07:18.540
understood was that each was occupying a completely different type of slope. While the Scots were

07:18.540 --> 07:24.360
still on the andesite, the volcanic rock, the English had set up on a piece of limestone

07:24.360 --> 07:30.080
called cement stone, and that was to make all the difference.

07:30.080 --> 07:34.740
To understand where these cement stone rocks came from, we need to fast forward 50 million

07:34.740 --> 07:43.740
years from when those volcanoes were exploding. The earth looks very different. We're in the

07:43.740 --> 07:51.360
Carboniferous, the next geological period after the Devonian, and a lot has changed.

07:51.360 --> 07:57.120
After the volcanic eruptions stopped, the Cheviot Mountains began to erode. Then at

07:57.120 --> 08:02.820
the beginning of the Carboniferous, sea levels rose, cutting them off. Being on the edge

08:02.820 --> 08:07.240
of this mountain range, Flodden Hill would have been right on the coastline, the tropical

08:07.240 --> 08:12.620
waters lapping up against it. It would have looked something like this. Not exactly how

08:12.620 --> 08:18.840
we think of Northumberland. Tons of sediment were deposited at the bottom of these shallow

08:18.840 --> 08:24.240
seas. Silt and sand washed out from rivers. The crushed shells of tiny marine animals

08:24.240 --> 08:31.800
mixed with mud. The detritus piled up over millions of years. When the sea finally retreated

08:31.800 --> 08:37.040
at the end of the Carboniferous, it left a thick layer of this material behind, collectively

08:37.040 --> 08:43.000
known as the cement stone group. This is an outcrop not far from the battlefield.

08:43.000 --> 08:48.820
You can see that the cement stone has hardened into this concrete-like rock, but it's weathered

08:48.820 --> 08:55.500
into a very permeable material. The water drains away very freely.

08:55.500 --> 09:01.380
In contrast to the impermeable andesite, rainwater drains easily from the cement stone group.

09:01.380 --> 09:06.260
It gushes through cracks in the limestone. It filters into and between the layers of

09:06.260 --> 09:10.740
sandstone. So these were the bedrocks on which our two

09:10.740 --> 09:17.460
armies now squared up. The English troops exhausted after a long forced march. The Scottish

09:17.540 --> 09:22.060
soldiers were rested and eager, and had a commanding position on the volcanic slopes

09:22.060 --> 09:27.180
of Branxton Hill. They also had the unbeatable weapon of the

09:27.180 --> 09:33.740
age, the Swiss pike. The pike was 15, 16 feet long. And you can

09:33.740 --> 09:40.740
imagine, a bit like a porcupine, lots of them together made a formidable weapon. The medieval

09:41.380 --> 09:48.380
version of the tank, with a front of 100 of these pikes moving forward at a steady pace,

09:50.300 --> 09:57.300
they were absolutely unstoppable and devastating. After an artillery exchange, the battle opened

10:01.540 --> 10:06.540
on the left flank, with formations of Scottish pikemen advancing across flat ground to the

10:06.580 --> 10:13.580
west of Branxton Hill, towards Sir Edmund Howard and his 4,000 English foot soldiers.

10:13.900 --> 10:19.060
The English were armed with the much smaller bill, a double-bladed weapon with a hook.

10:19.060 --> 10:26.060
But the landscape easily favoured the pike. In this open country, the Scots charged into

10:26.500 --> 10:32.580
the English lines and scattered them. If this success could be repeated with the other two

10:32.580 --> 10:38.340
pike battalions, the Scots would easily have carried the day. But on the rest of the battlefield,

10:38.340 --> 10:42.820
the geology was different. James IV didn't know it, but the volcanic

10:42.820 --> 10:48.080
andesite under his feet was going to be a problem. And it was compounded by another

10:48.080 --> 10:55.080
geological event he was equally, blissfully unaware of.

10:55.540 --> 10:59.860
To understand it, we have to fast forward through the Carboniferous, through the age

10:59.900 --> 11:05.260
of the dinosaurs, through the Tertiary period, almost right up to the present day in geological

11:05.260 --> 11:10.460
terms. Through all this, the continent of Europe was pushed northwards by crustal plate

11:10.460 --> 11:17.140
movement. Britain left the tropics and migrated to its current position. Now, in its colder,

11:17.140 --> 11:24.140
more northerly latitude, it was hit head on by the Ice Age.

11:25.140 --> 11:32.140
15,000 years ago, all this was buried under an ice sheet one mile thick. That's just

11:33.140 --> 11:39.140
recently in geological terms, which means that the ice has left its mark.

11:39.140 --> 11:42.940
If you've got an eye for these things, the hills and valleys here are full of glacial

11:42.940 --> 11:48.860
clues and features. A huge ice sheet crept down from Scotland, hit the cheviate hills

11:48.860 --> 11:53.940
and deflected to the east. The moving ice carried particles of eroded material in the

11:53.940 --> 11:59.740
form of sand and gravel and churned up the underlying rock into a fine clay. As the Ice

11:59.740 --> 12:05.460
Age ended, it melted, depositing this material on the landscape. And though neither side

12:05.460 --> 12:11.460
could see it, the ice had left its fatal mark on the battlefield. Each slope had been coated

12:11.460 --> 12:16.300
with a different glacial material. So the English began to draw up their formations

12:16.300 --> 12:21.800
on the well-drained cement stone. The Scots marched towards them, on top of the impermeable

12:21.840 --> 12:27.200
volcanic andesite. The retreating glaciers had gifted the English well-drained deposits

12:27.200 --> 12:33.320
of sand and gravel. For the Scots, it had dumped a mucky, thick coating of clay called

12:33.320 --> 12:40.320
till. On 9 September 1513, it began to rain. This had little effect on the English, who

12:40.760 --> 12:46.760
stood firm on the cement stone, which carried the water away. But here on the Scottish side,

12:46.760 --> 12:52.440
the volcanic bedrock trapped water in the coating of glacial clay. While the battalions

12:52.440 --> 12:57.000
of pikes had done well on the left flank, here in the muddy slopes of the centre and

12:57.000 --> 13:04.000
the right, the Scots began to slip and stumble. Slowly they began to break formation.

13:05.200 --> 13:09.600
By the time they reached the bottom of the slope, their lines were already faltering.

13:09.600 --> 13:14.480
And now they met the next obstacle, and this is where a mountain building event in Europe,

13:14.480 --> 13:21.480
millions of years ago, was to seal their fate.

13:28.960 --> 13:33.400
Throughout the Devonian and Carboniferous periods, a series of collisions between crustal

13:33.400 --> 13:39.380
plates was throwing up mountain chains all over Europe. Called the Hercinian orogeny,

13:39.380 --> 13:44.380
it formed the Ardennes in Belgium and the Massif Central in France. It was an event

13:44.380 --> 13:49.140
that took place over hundreds of millions of years, and even today geologists are still

13:49.140 --> 13:54.420
trying to make sense of it. But one thing they do know is that this upheaval caused

13:54.420 --> 13:58.780
rocks in outlying areas to crack.

13:58.780 --> 14:03.300
The cracks, called faults, run for several miles, and half a dozen can be found in the

14:03.300 --> 14:08.020
Cheviot Hills. Each fault was heralded by an earthquake.

14:08.020 --> 14:13.260
And this is Flodden Fault, running right through the middle of the battlefield. It separated

14:13.260 --> 14:19.260
the Scots from the English. A series of earthquakes thrust up these andesites and pushed them

14:19.260 --> 14:24.940
hard up against the cement stone. And it was this fault line that was to seal the fate

14:24.940 --> 14:27.220
of the Scottish battalions.

14:27.220 --> 14:34.060
This big fault system, which juxtaposes the younger cement stones of the Carboniferous

14:34.060 --> 14:41.060
against the Devonian volcanics, that has moved the rocks on either side into that position,

14:42.840 --> 14:48.020
such that subsequently, when they've weathered and eroded, you've now got this great topographic

14:48.020 --> 14:49.240
difference.

14:49.240 --> 14:54.180
The topographic difference washed tonnes of eroded material into the newly created gash

14:54.180 --> 15:00.060
in the earth, forming a deep, boggy sump. The charge of the Scottish pike formations,

15:00.060 --> 15:05.180
already disrupted by the wet clay till and the badly drained andesite slope, hit the

15:05.180 --> 15:10.700
sticky bog of the fault line and began to break apart.

15:10.700 --> 15:17.700
The pikes? Unstoppable. Formidable. Whilst they're in motion.

15:18.500 --> 15:25.500
Unfortunately for the Scots, on the steeper part of Brankson Hill, suddenly the front

15:28.980 --> 15:34.260
ranks were knee deep in mud, which slowed them down. The ranks behind piled on top of

15:34.260 --> 15:41.260
them, complete confusion, and as they were no longer moving, they were suddenly a target.

15:42.260 --> 15:46.940
Then the English bills had a go.

15:46.940 --> 15:53.940
It has a point for stabbing and jabbing, it has, this one has another point for hacking

15:55.980 --> 16:02.980
into armour, into a helmet, and it also has this deadly hook for grabbing the back of

16:03.780 --> 16:10.500
the knee, or eye-wateringly, up and under.

16:10.500 --> 16:17.500
It also has this axe-type blade here. This is a fearsome weapon.

16:17.500 --> 16:24.500
From what had seemed almost certain victory, the Scots were now, incredibly, facing likely

16:24.500 --> 16:31.500
defeat. Their only hope was a battalion of Highlanders held in reserve on the right flank.

16:48.020 --> 16:53.860
But a Highland charge was stopped in its tracks by a breakaway detachment of English archers.

16:53.860 --> 16:58.900
The Highlanders, thinking they'd been outflanked by a much larger contingent of Surrey's army,

16:58.900 --> 17:01.860
broke off their charge and fled.

17:01.860 --> 17:07.300
James was now desperately fighting on foot, alongside his men, their ranks broken, their

17:07.300 --> 17:13.300
weapons useless, and surrounded on all sides. An arrow was shot through his mouth, and then

17:13.300 --> 17:20.060
an unearned English soldier sliced his throat with a bill. James died along with his son,

17:20.060 --> 17:27.060
eight earls and thirteen barons. The cream of Scottish nobility, a generation of leaders,

17:27.260 --> 17:34.260
was wiped out.

17:34.260 --> 17:41.260
Every year on the anniversary of the battle, a commemoration takes place at the Flodden

17:53.260 --> 18:00.020
Monument overlooking the battle site. This is very much a Scottish affair. While in England

18:00.020 --> 18:04.900
the Battle of Flodden is largely forgotten, for the Scots it's a significant and wrenching

18:04.900 --> 18:11.180
piece of history. What could have been a golden age of Scottish Renaissance ended abruptly

18:11.180 --> 18:13.700
and catastrophically.

18:13.700 --> 18:20.700
Before the Battle of Flodden, Scotland was a very prosperous nation. James IV founded

18:21.580 --> 18:28.100
universities, he looked after his people, and he was the most popular king Scotland

18:28.100 --> 18:35.100
ever had, and then it all finished here. Within a hundred years, Scotland was united

18:36.580 --> 18:40.800
with England, the crowns were united.

18:40.800 --> 18:46.420
Battles are rarely decided by one factor alone. If James had been less impetuous, if the Highlanders

18:46.420 --> 18:51.380
had charged earlier, the Scots might have carried the day. But the early Scottish success

18:51.380 --> 18:56.500
on the left flank showed that what ultimately defeated them were geological events they

18:56.540 --> 18:59.860
never even knew had happened.

18:59.860 --> 19:05.360
The events three or four hundred million years ago have dictated the nature of the lithology,

19:05.360 --> 19:12.360
the rocks beneath our feet at that particular point. And also not just the depositional

19:13.820 --> 19:20.820
and environmental effects of that time, but the subsequent earth movements.

19:21.540 --> 19:28.540
Geology sleeps underground. It only gets our attention when new disasters hit the headlines,

19:28.700 --> 19:35.700
earthquakes, landslides, tsunami. But events that occurred far back in time are just disasters

19:35.780 --> 19:42.780
lying in wait. A volcanic eruption that no one saw, an earthquake no one felt, an ice

19:44.420 --> 19:50.040
sheet that came and went while our ancestors were still migrating out of Africa. All these

19:50.040 --> 19:57.040
events have been waiting for their date with history.
