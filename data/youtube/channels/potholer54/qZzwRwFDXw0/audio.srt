1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,000
As a scientist, I know that global warming doesn't really exist at all in any sense of significance.

2
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:14,000
Thanks for the reassurance, John. Only one problem.

3
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:16,000
Hello, you're not a scientist.

4
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:20,000
You got a degree in media studies and became a TV weatherman.

5
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:25,000
And while you claim to be a meteorologist, the American Meteorological Society disagrees.

6
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:29,000
You're not on the list of certified broadcast meteorologists.

7
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:33,000
In other words, TV weather personalities with degrees in meteorology.

8
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:35,000
And the biggest irony of the lot...

9
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:41,000
There are thousands who signed a petition, 19,000 on a petition against global warming.

10
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:46,000
Coleman keeps promoting a petition of scientists against anthropogenic climate change,

11
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:50,000
but his lack of a science degree means he isn't even qualified to sign it.

12
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:54,000
Lord Christopher Monckton, former science advisor to Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher.

13
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:57,000
Christopher Monckton has a degree in journalism.

14
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:01,000
So how did he become Margaret Thatcher's science advisor?

15
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:05,000
Answer? He didn't. He was her economic policy advisor.

16
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:09,000
We'll see more of Monckton and his ideas in a future video.

17
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:12,000
So if we're going to look at the consensus on climate change,

18
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:17,000
we should start by defining which group of people is supposed to be reaching that consensus.

19
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:20,000
Since Coleman and Monckton are so keen to pretend they're scientists,

20
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:23,000
they seem to think that that's the criterion.

21
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:30,000
And so do a lot of other people who cite this petition as evidence that there's no consensus on anthropogenic climate change.

22
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:34,000
After all, scientists are supposed to know all there is to know about every field of science.

23
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:38,000
Well, Brains, your phenomenal mind made all this possible.

24
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:44,000
In Thunderbirds, Brains was able to turn his hand at everything from the dubious aerodynamics of Thunderbird 2

25
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:47,000
to the hydrology of New York City.

26
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:52,000
Now, underground streams do exist, but they've never been considered a threat.

27
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:58,000
Brains may have been an expert in every aspect of science, but his arse was made of plastic.

28
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:03,000
Real life scientists aren't experts on everything, they have to specialise.

29
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:07,000
And the more they specialise, the greater their expertise.

30
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:13,000
A wood engineer knows a lot about wood engineering, but that doesn't mean he understands atmospheric physics.

31
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:20,000
So when Stephen C. Zilkowski, who is a wood engineer, signs his name to a petition telling us there's no evidence

32
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:28,000
that carbon dioxide causes catastrophic heating of the Earth, he's simply stating his belief based on whatever he's read.

33
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:36,000
We have no idea what that is, but it's certainly not this series of papers explaining the cause of catastrophic warming during the late Permian.

34
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:43,000
And why should Earl M. Argard, a professor of biology at Southern Adventist University, have read the paper either?

35
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:53,000
In between Argard and Zilkowski, the first and last names on the petition are an assortment of metallurgists, botanists, agronomists, organic chemists and so on

36
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:58,000
who tell us they haven't seen any evidence for CO2 causing catastrophic heating either.

37
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:05,000
The vast majority of scientists who signed the petition have never studied climatology and don't do any research into it.

38
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:11,000
It doesn't matter if you're a PhD. A PhD in metallurgy just makes you better at metallurgy.

39
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:15,000
It doesn't transform you into some kind of an expert in paleoclimatology.

40
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:23,000
Since this is so obvious, why is it that so many people are convinced that Thunderbirds is real and every scientist is brains?

41
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:28,000
Even an intelligent journalist like John Stossel falls into this misconception.

42
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:36,000
17,000 scientists signed a petition saying there's no convincing evidence that greenhouse gases will disrupt the Earth's climate.

43
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:42,000
31,000 scientists are saying that global warming is beneficial and it's natural. It's not caused by humans.

44
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:50,000
OK, let me try this again. Since even the dumbest reporters must at some time have contracted an embarrassing medical condition and visited a hospital,

45
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:55,000
why is the specialisation of sciences such a hard concept to grasp?

46
00:03:55,000 --> 00:04:03,000
If you had a skin rash, you wouldn't go to a climatologist to be cured any more than you'd go to a doctor to learn the facts about climate.

47
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:09,000
And surely we understand that medical experts, like all scientists, specialise further within the field of medicine.

48
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:23,000
With a skin rash, you wouldn't go to an immunologist or an audiologist, a paediatrician, a respirologist, a gynaecologist, an obstetrician, a cardiologist, a neurologist or any other of the medical disciplines. You'd go to a dermatologist.

49
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:30,000
The same goes for fields like meteorology and geophysics, which also encompass a huge number of specialist fields.

50
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:40,000
Most graduates in these subjects don't go on to study climate. A lot of meteorologists become weather forecasters or pilots or teachers or homemakers or business people.

51
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:49,000
I know a lot of geophysicists who specialise in measuring seismic and magnetic anomalies in mining exploration. One of them runs a bar in Madrid.

52
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:59,000
So the petition's suggestion that everyone with a degree in meteorology or geophysics knows a lot about climate change or is familiar with all the research that's been done is patent crap.

53
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:10,000
To people unfamiliar with the way science works, this can be confusing. Bob Carter, for example, is described as a paleoclimatologist in this US Senate committee report.

54
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:19,000
But since his PhD was in paleontology and nearly all his research work has been in the field of stratigraphy, why not more accurately call him a stratigrapher?

55
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:31,000
Phil Chapman was described as a geophysicist when he wanted to promote his thoughts on climate, but his bio on NASA's website shows that he was a physicist who specialised in aeronautical instrumentation.

56
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:41,000
Tim Ball has a variety of titles. 28 years Professor of Climatology at the University of Winnipeg. 32 years as Professor of Climatology at the University of Winnipeg.

57
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:48,000
A former climatology professor. Professor Tim Ball of the Department of Climatology at the University of Winnipeg.

58
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:56,000
OK, here's where you slipped up, Tim. There is no climatology department at the University of Winnipeg. Sorry, that was fairly easy to verify.

59
00:05:56,000 --> 00:06:05,000
Climatology was just one small element of the geography course that you taught. Your major was in geography and you were a geography professor.

60
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:18,000
So you weren't a professor of climatology. And according to your own biography, you were a professor at the University of Winnipeg from 1988 to 1996. So that's 8 years. Not 28 or 32.

61
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:20,000
Of course he's belittling geography.

62
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:34,000
No, the problem isn't that anyone's belittling geography. The problem is that you're inflating 8 years of geography, a perfectly respectable subject, into 32 years of climatology, which is something completely different. And you got caught out.

63
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:45,000
Ball's only academic contribution to climate science was a handful of papers, mostly on the historical weather records of the Hudson's Bay Company in central Canada and mostly published in the 1980s.

64
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:51,000
None of that research addressed or even tried to challenge the accepted link between CO2 and global warming.

65
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:59,000
If Ball hadn't been so heavily promoted on television, most climate scientists would never have heard of this obscure geography professor.

66
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:09,000
If all this sounds a bit negative and dismissive, it's because people with few qualifications and little research history would never be promoted as experts in any other scientific field.

67
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:13,000
So why do the media insist on lowering the standards for climate science?

68
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:23,000
Of course Al Gore isn't an expert either. Neither is Leonardo DiCaprio or Danny Glover or any of the activists who go on television urging action on global warming.

69
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:34,000
What actors, politicians and lawyers believe is as irrelevant to our understanding of climate science as the beliefs of media experts and journalists, or for that matter, my opinions and beliefs.

70
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:44,000
Even the IPCC is irrelevant. What matters is what's shown through properly published research, which is why it's the researchers who are considered the experts.

71
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:47,000
And that's true of all scientific disciplines.

72
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:56,000
The researchers not only have to have studied their subjects, they also have to keep up with new developments in their field through reading scientific journals and attending seminars.

73
00:07:56,000 --> 00:08:02,000
Of course climate change theory, like any scientific theory, comprises evidence from a number of different fields.

74
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:08,000
It depends on input from dendrochronologists and glaciologists, as well as statisticians and petrologists.

75
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:11,000
Each specialist can speak to his own field of expertise.

76
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:18,000
But if he starts spouting opinions on something outside that field, then he's not speaking from a position of expertise.

77
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:22,000
If you want to know what a real expert climatologist looks like, here's one.

78
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:29,000
John Christie has a PhD in Atmospheric Sciences and a long track record of published research in climate change.

79
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:32,000
And he's still actively engaged in climate research.

80
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:37,000
Here's another. Richard Linson has a PhD in Atmospheric Physics.

81
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:41,000
He's been a researcher in meteorology and climatology since 1966.

82
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:49,000
Like Christie, he has a long and solid history of published research into climate change, not stratigraphy or electronics.

83
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:57,000
The problem is, real climatologists like these who oppose the accepted climate model have been dwindling in number over the last 20 years.

84
00:08:57,000 --> 00:09:05,000
So if you're an American journalist who wants to use expert climatologists to question the accepted climate change model, the choice is now pretty limited.

85
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:10,000
John Christie, Richard Linson, Patrick Michaels and Roy Spencer.

86
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:18,000
...posed as a result of category 4 and 5 hurricanes in the Atlantic basin in a completely futile attempt to...

87
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:22,000
...and say that the central tenants now become politicised, solar energy and wind...

88
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:26,000
...for the 10 years before that and 0.43 for the 10 years before that.

89
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:33,000
So the question of who's an expert in any scientific discipline, including climatology, is really very simple and long established.

90
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:37,000
If these so-called experts have to lie or are vague about their resume,

91
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:44,000
if nothing is ever outside their wide field of expertise, if they spend more time talking about politics and economics than hard science,

92
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:51,000
and if they make assertions completely unsupported by any research, chances are they're not a real expert.

93
00:09:51,000 --> 00:10:00,000
But if you still find all this confusing, don't worry. Just be reassured by the prognosis of the man who's not a scientist but plays one on TV.

94
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:09,000
The Earth is going to change with cycles of the sun and with ocean currents and we're all going to do just fine.
