0	10000	As a scientist, I know that global warming doesn't really exist at all in any sense of significance.
10000	14000	Thanks for the reassurance, John. Only one problem.
14000	16000	Hello, you're not a scientist.
16000	20000	You got a degree in media studies and became a TV weatherman.
20000	25000	And while you claim to be a meteorologist, the American Meteorological Society disagrees.
25000	29000	You're not on the list of certified broadcast meteorologists.
29000	33000	In other words, TV weather personalities with degrees in meteorology.
33000	35000	And the biggest irony of the lot...
35000	41000	There are thousands who signed a petition, 19,000 on a petition against global warming.
41000	46000	Coleman keeps promoting a petition of scientists against anthropogenic climate change,
46000	50000	but his lack of a science degree means he isn't even qualified to sign it.
50000	54000	Lord Christopher Monckton, former science advisor to Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher.
54000	57000	Christopher Monckton has a degree in journalism.
57000	61000	So how did he become Margaret Thatcher's science advisor?
61000	65000	Answer? He didn't. He was her economic policy advisor.
65000	69000	We'll see more of Monckton and his ideas in a future video.
69000	72000	So if we're going to look at the consensus on climate change,
72000	77000	we should start by defining which group of people is supposed to be reaching that consensus.
77000	80000	Since Coleman and Monckton are so keen to pretend they're scientists,
80000	83000	they seem to think that that's the criterion.
83000	90000	And so do a lot of other people who cite this petition as evidence that there's no consensus on anthropogenic climate change.
90000	94000	After all, scientists are supposed to know all there is to know about every field of science.
94000	98000	Well, Brains, your phenomenal mind made all this possible.
98000	104000	In Thunderbirds, Brains was able to turn his hand at everything from the dubious aerodynamics of Thunderbird 2
104000	107000	to the hydrology of New York City.
107000	112000	Now, underground streams do exist, but they've never been considered a threat.
112000	118000	Brains may have been an expert in every aspect of science, but his arse was made of plastic.
118000	123000	Real life scientists aren't experts on everything, they have to specialise.
123000	127000	And the more they specialise, the greater their expertise.
127000	133000	A wood engineer knows a lot about wood engineering, but that doesn't mean he understands atmospheric physics.
133000	140000	So when Stephen C. Zilkowski, who is a wood engineer, signs his name to a petition telling us there's no evidence
140000	148000	that carbon dioxide causes catastrophic heating of the Earth, he's simply stating his belief based on whatever he's read.
148000	156000	We have no idea what that is, but it's certainly not this series of papers explaining the cause of catastrophic warming during the late Permian.
156000	163000	And why should Earl M. Argard, a professor of biology at Southern Adventist University, have read the paper either?
163000	173000	In between Argard and Zilkowski, the first and last names on the petition are an assortment of metallurgists, botanists, agronomists, organic chemists and so on
173000	178000	who tell us they haven't seen any evidence for CO2 causing catastrophic heating either.
178000	185000	The vast majority of scientists who signed the petition have never studied climatology and don't do any research into it.
185000	191000	It doesn't matter if you're a PhD. A PhD in metallurgy just makes you better at metallurgy.
191000	195000	It doesn't transform you into some kind of an expert in paleoclimatology.
195000	203000	Since this is so obvious, why is it that so many people are convinced that Thunderbirds is real and every scientist is brains?
203000	208000	Even an intelligent journalist like John Stossel falls into this misconception.
208000	216000	17,000 scientists signed a petition saying there's no convincing evidence that greenhouse gases will disrupt the Earth's climate.
217000	222000	31,000 scientists are saying that global warming is beneficial and it's natural. It's not caused by humans.
222000	230000	OK, let me try this again. Since even the dumbest reporters must at some time have contracted an embarrassing medical condition and visited a hospital,
230000	235000	why is the specialisation of sciences such a hard concept to grasp?
235000	243000	If you had a skin rash, you wouldn't go to a climatologist to be cured any more than you'd go to a doctor to learn the facts about climate.
243000	249000	And surely we understand that medical experts, like all scientists, specialise further within the field of medicine.
249000	263000	With a skin rash, you wouldn't go to an immunologist or an audiologist, a paediatrician, a respirologist, a gynaecologist, an obstetrician, a cardiologist, a neurologist or any other of the medical disciplines. You'd go to a dermatologist.
263000	270000	The same goes for fields like meteorology and geophysics, which also encompass a huge number of specialist fields.
270000	280000	Most graduates in these subjects don't go on to study climate. A lot of meteorologists become weather forecasters or pilots or teachers or homemakers or business people.
280000	289000	I know a lot of geophysicists who specialise in measuring seismic and magnetic anomalies in mining exploration. One of them runs a bar in Madrid.
289000	299000	So the petition's suggestion that everyone with a degree in meteorology or geophysics knows a lot about climate change or is familiar with all the research that's been done is patent crap.
300000	310000	To people unfamiliar with the way science works, this can be confusing. Bob Carter, for example, is described as a paleoclimatologist in this US Senate committee report.
310000	319000	But since his PhD was in paleontology and nearly all his research work has been in the field of stratigraphy, why not more accurately call him a stratigrapher?
320000	331000	Phil Chapman was described as a geophysicist when he wanted to promote his thoughts on climate, but his bio on NASA's website shows that he was a physicist who specialised in aeronautical instrumentation.
331000	341000	Tim Ball has a variety of titles. 28 years Professor of Climatology at the University of Winnipeg. 32 years as Professor of Climatology at the University of Winnipeg.
341000	348000	A former climatology professor. Professor Tim Ball of the Department of Climatology at the University of Winnipeg.
348000	356000	OK, here's where you slipped up, Tim. There is no climatology department at the University of Winnipeg. Sorry, that was fairly easy to verify.
356000	365000	Climatology was just one small element of the geography course that you taught. Your major was in geography and you were a geography professor.
365000	378000	So you weren't a professor of climatology. And according to your own biography, you were a professor at the University of Winnipeg from 1988 to 1996. So that's 8 years. Not 28 or 32.
378000	380000	Of course he's belittling geography.
380000	394000	No, the problem isn't that anyone's belittling geography. The problem is that you're inflating 8 years of geography, a perfectly respectable subject, into 32 years of climatology, which is something completely different. And you got caught out.
394000	405000	Ball's only academic contribution to climate science was a handful of papers, mostly on the historical weather records of the Hudson's Bay Company in central Canada and mostly published in the 1980s.
405000	411000	None of that research addressed or even tried to challenge the accepted link between CO2 and global warming.
411000	419000	If Ball hadn't been so heavily promoted on television, most climate scientists would never have heard of this obscure geography professor.
419000	429000	If all this sounds a bit negative and dismissive, it's because people with few qualifications and little research history would never be promoted as experts in any other scientific field.
429000	433000	So why do the media insist on lowering the standards for climate science?
434000	443000	Of course Al Gore isn't an expert either. Neither is Leonardo DiCaprio or Danny Glover or any of the activists who go on television urging action on global warming.
443000	454000	What actors, politicians and lawyers believe is as irrelevant to our understanding of climate science as the beliefs of media experts and journalists, or for that matter, my opinions and beliefs.
454000	464000	Even the IPCC is irrelevant. What matters is what's shown through properly published research, which is why it's the researchers who are considered the experts.
464000	467000	And that's true of all scientific disciplines.
467000	476000	The researchers not only have to have studied their subjects, they also have to keep up with new developments in their field through reading scientific journals and attending seminars.
476000	482000	Of course climate change theory, like any scientific theory, comprises evidence from a number of different fields.
482000	488000	It depends on input from dendrochronologists and glaciologists, as well as statisticians and petrologists.
488000	491000	Each specialist can speak to his own field of expertise.
491000	498000	But if he starts spouting opinions on something outside that field, then he's not speaking from a position of expertise.
498000	502000	If you want to know what a real expert climatologist looks like, here's one.
502000	509000	John Christie has a PhD in Atmospheric Sciences and a long track record of published research in climate change.
509000	512000	And he's still actively engaged in climate research.
512000	517000	Here's another. Richard Linson has a PhD in Atmospheric Physics.
517000	521000	He's been a researcher in meteorology and climatology since 1966.
521000	529000	Like Christie, he has a long and solid history of published research into climate change, not stratigraphy or electronics.
529000	537000	The problem is, real climatologists like these who oppose the accepted climate model have been dwindling in number over the last 20 years.
537000	545000	So if you're an American journalist who wants to use expert climatologists to question the accepted climate change model, the choice is now pretty limited.
545000	550000	John Christie, Richard Linson, Patrick Michaels and Roy Spencer.
550000	558000	...posed as a result of category 4 and 5 hurricanes in the Atlantic basin in a completely futile attempt to...
558000	562000	...and say that the central tenants now become politicised, solar energy and wind...
562000	566000	...for the 10 years before that and 0.43 for the 10 years before that.
566000	573000	So the question of who's an expert in any scientific discipline, including climatology, is really very simple and long established.
573000	577000	If these so-called experts have to lie or are vague about their resume,
577000	584000	if nothing is ever outside their wide field of expertise, if they spend more time talking about politics and economics than hard science,
584000	591000	and if they make assertions completely unsupported by any research, chances are they're not a real expert.
591000	600000	But if you still find all this confusing, don't worry. Just be reassured by the prognosis of the man who's not a scientist but plays one on TV.
600000	609000	The Earth is going to change with cycles of the sun and with ocean currents and we're all going to do just fine.
