0	4160	To those who don't know this channel, I'm a former geologist who's been a science journalist for
4160	10640	25 years. My YouTube channel debunks all kinds of scientific urban myths. So here's a summary
10640	14960	of the most common misrepresentations of science I've come across over the years
14960	19680	regarding climate change, and the real science they're misrepresenting or omitting.
20480	24320	Let's start with a famous myth about the name of the subject we're talking about.
24320	33760	No, first of all, they started with global warming because they wanted to focus on CO2,
33760	36080	and they started talking about climate change.
37120	39520	That's why they call it climate change now and not global warming.
39520	44560	No, it goes back a lot further than that. The conclusion that CO2 concentration affects
44560	50560	global temperature was made 120 years ago and confirmed in the 1930s and 40s.
51040	56320	In the 1950s, it became known as the carbon dioxide theory of climatic change,
56320	60560	or climate change for short. This paper was written in 1955.
61200	65440	That's why back in the 1980s, we saw the formation of something called
65440	68400	the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change.
69360	74320	The term global warming describes the global warming that causes this climate change.
76240	79760	Climate changes all the time. It's a very natural thing.
79760	82640	Climate change is a natural phenomenon that always will be.
83600	85600	The climate change has always been occurring.
86160	91120	How do you explain climate change that occurred 10,000 years ago before man had a carbon footprint?
92080	96000	Because of course it's not the mere presence of humans that's changing the climate,
96000	101280	it's carbon dioxide. We know why carbon dioxide concentration is rising now,
101280	103680	and geologists know why it rose in the past.
104400	109680	First of all, let's get one thing clear. The main active drivers of global temperature now
109680	113680	are exactly the same as in the past, long before humans came along.
114320	118720	Which shouldn't really be a surprise, because the laws of physics haven't changed.
118720	121760	They're threefold. Changes in solar irradiance,
121760	124000	which is the amount of heat we receive from the sun,
124560	128560	changes in carbon dioxide concentration, which traps that heat,
128560	132320	and changes in aerosol concentration, which reflects that heat.
133520	136480	Just to anticipate a few other myths that I'll cover later,
136480	140320	things like water vapour content, cloud cover and ice albedo
140320	144320	respond to these changes in temperature, but they aren't the primary causes.
145200	148080	And although winds and oceans move the heat around,
148080	152960	they don't significantly change the temperature of the earth, so they aren't active forcings either.
154000	158720	So how did carbon dioxide levels change before factories and SUVs came along?
159840	164000	Well, let's start at the beginning of the Phanerozoic, about 500 million years ago,
164000	167280	when CO2 levels were nearly 20 times higher than today.
167840	172800	Over hundreds of millions of years they got taken out of the atmosphere by chemical weathering,
172800	177520	which turns the carbon dioxide into calcium carbonates and deposits it as sediment in the
177520	183280	oceans. So trillions of tonnes of CO2 that were once in the atmosphere are now locked up in
183280	189600	limestone. The other way CO2 got taken out was when living matter got buried as coal and oil.
190320	197200	But this gradual decline in CO2 concentration is punctuated by sporadic increases in CO2 during
197200	202400	flood basalt events â€“ occasional weaknesses in the earth's crust that spill thousands of
202400	207760	square miles of thick lava and release billions of tonnes of CO2 back into the atmosphere.
209200	214000	So that brings us to the next myth. Since CO2 is a powerful greenhouse gas
214000	219200	and CO2 levels were much higher in the past, why was the earth sometimes colder?
219600	226400	Here there was an ice age when CO2 was at least 10 times higher than it is today.
226400	232800	The reason is very simple. The sun was much weaker back then. Over the last 500 million years there's
232800	239040	been a slow and steady increase in solar output. So during the late Ordovician, the time period
239040	245360	Patrick Moore is talking about, solar output was about 4% lower than today. So it's no surprise
245360	251360	that the earth was in an ice age. The question the critics need to answer is why was that the
251360	257520	exception? Why was it much hotter than today for hundreds of millions of years either side of this
257520	268080	brief ice age? And here we had almost 7,000 parts per million of CO2 compared with 385 or thereby
268080	275200	today. 7,000 then. Temperature managed to get up to about 22 Celsius. That's the point. How did it
275200	281280	manage to get up to 22 Celsius, which is 6 degrees hotter than today, even though the sun was about
281280	288240	4% cooler? There's never been an answer from the critics, but scientists explain it quite easily.
288240	294880	Since CO2 has a strong warming effect, it was this insulating blanket of CO2 that kept the earth
294880	300320	warm. And researchers have found that the reason it cooled during the Ordovician was because a
300320	306480	series of tectonic collisions led to a period of mountain building that sped up chemical weathering
306480	313520	and took a lot of CO2 out of the atmosphere. As CO2 levels fell, the earth cooled and triggered
313520	319920	an ice age. Since the increase in solar irradiance has been very slow and steady over the last 500
319920	325360	million years, researchers have found that it's these sporadic increases and decreases in CO2
325360	331680	levels that have largely driven global temperature. By the way, the graph Christopher Mungton is using
331680	337440	is the same graph Patrick Moore was using, just in different colours. It comes from a blog.
337440	342880	CO2 levels compiled by a researcher called Robert Berner, shown in black, have been put alongside
342880	348240	global temperatures compiled by Christopher Scottese, shown in blue. Scottese drew the
348240	354800	temperature sketch nearly 20 years ago based on a book that's now 26 years old, so he's recently
354800	359920	updated it. This is Scottese's more accurate and more recent reconstruction.
363840	367680	And look at how little correlation there is in that graph between
367680	373600	temperature in blue there and CO2 concentration in black. And it shows very clearly that there's
373600	380720	no lockstep correlation between CO2 and global temperature. But there's no lockstep correlation
380720	386400	between solar irradiation and global temperature either. But surely we can't conclude from that
386400	392560	that the Sun has no effect on global temperature. Since there are three main active drivers of
392560	397600	global temperature, you can't just ignore the other two, you have to look at all three.
397600	402960	And when you do that, you get a very good correlation. Correlation doesn't necessarily mean
402960	407600	causation, of course, so in this video I'm not going to try to show you the evidence for the
407600	413440	strong link between CO2 and global temperature. That's in another video I made. In this video,
413440	418160	I'm just debunking the most widespread myths about climate science and the claim that there's
418160	424960	no correlation is one of them. Now let's move forward in time to the present. And to do that,
424960	430160	I want to give you an idea of the difference in time scale that represents. Let's take a walk up
430160	437520	the Mississippi River from New Orleans to Memphis. That's 485 miles, so that represents about a mile
437520	443280	for every million years of the Phanerozoic. It's a long walk that Google Maps reckons would take
443280	450720	about a week non-stop. Only the last two miles represents our ice age and the last 40 years of
450720	456480	strong warming is just a couple of inches. That's the period of time we're going to be looking at in
456480	462960	the next couple of myths. So what do you think is causing global warming? The Sun. There's
462960	469200	definitely no question. They virtually ignore the Sun as a factor of climate change. The Sun is
469200	475840	driving climate change. CO2 is irrelevant. It's the Sun's stupid. So why do climate researchers
475840	481920	say it's not the Sun? Because solar irradiance, shown here in blue, has been decreasing over the
481920	488480	last 40 years, so it can't possibly have caused temperatures, shown in red, to go higher. The
488480	493440	claim that the role of the Sun has been ignored by scientists is also wrong. Scientists have devoted
493440	498800	a huge amount of effort into monitoring the output of the Sun and studying its effects on global
498800	504640	temperature, both now and in the past. When I mentioned this before, people have been confused
504640	509280	by the fact that the Sun has been getting cooler over the last 40 years, when I've also said that
509280	514160	for the last 500 million years it's been getting hotter. That's because of the difference in
514160	520000	magnitude and time scale. Here's where the time illustration will help. Because the growing output
520000	526960	of the Sun represents our uphill climb from New Orleans to Memphis. We're climbing 308 feet, which
526960	532880	is quite a lot. It's the height of the Statue of Liberty. That represents the 4% increase in
532880	540640	solar output. But over 485 miles you wouldn't even notice it. The road looks pretty flat. What you
540640	546800	would notice are the very small dips and inclines over short periods. Even this wheelchair ramp down
546800	552800	from a sidewalk onto the road represents a decrease in solar activity over hundreds of years, similar
552800	558800	to the Little Ice Age. In other words, the tiny drop in solar irradiation over the last 40 years
558800	564960	would go unnoticed when set against the huge rise in solar irradiation over the last 500 million
564960	571760	years. And the other side of the coin is that the long-term rise in solar irradiation is so slow
571760	574640	that it wouldn't even be noticed over a 40-year period.
578240	584640	There are many more factors in play than simply the concentration of CO2 in the atmosphere.
586000	590880	Factors such as the shape and size of the Earth's elliptical orbit around the Sun.
590960	597600	Lead scientist at NASA said this. He said that what ended the Ice Age was global wobbling.
597600	602320	Is the wobbling of the Earth included in any of your modellings? And the answer was no.
602320	607280	When you have a model and you say we're going to leave out the most important impact of that model
607840	613680	out of our theory and not talk about global wobbling, how can you make projections?
613680	619200	Because right now these wobbles are not affecting us. They're well known and very predictable.
619200	622800	At the moment there's a very small change over a period of thousands of years,
622800	627360	but for reasons I've just explained this is too small to be measurable over a 40-year or
627360	632320	100-year period. The last time the Earth's wobble had a significant effect was about
632320	637360	15,000 years ago and the next time will be at least 16,000 years from now.
639760	644000	Now one thing that kind of jumps out at you is, do they ever fit together?
644000	649520	But looks can be deceiving. Al Gore is glossing over the fact that the start of each deglaciation
649520	655920	was not caused by CO2. It was caused, as we've seen, by a wobble in the Earth's axis and orbit
655920	661280	that allowed a little more sunlight to hit the Earth. Over most of the Phanerozoic these wobbles
661280	667360	have no discernible effect. The change in global temperature is too small. But an Ice Age is
667360	673200	different because ice has properties that amplify the warming far more than when the Earth is ice
673200	679520	free. When a small amount of ice melts less sunlight is reflected back into space and methane
679520	686320	and carbon dioxide locked up in frozen soils and cold oceans are released and that causes more
686320	692960	warming. The amount of extra sunlight the Earth receives due to its orbital wobbling isn't enough
692960	698160	to melt ice sheets the size of continents. What does that are the amplifying factors,
698160	702960	as we'll see when we move on to our next myth, the complete opposite of the previous one.
703200	711440	So here we're looking at the ice core record from Vostok and in the red we see temperature
711440	718000	going up from early time to later time at a very key interval when we came out of a glaciation
718000	725840	and we see the temperature going up and then we see the CO2 coming up. CO2 lags behind that
725840	731840	increase. It's got an 800 year lag so temperature is leading CO2 by 800 years.
732720	740000	So obviously carbon dioxide is not the cause of that warming. In fact we can say that the warming
740800	745600	produced the increase in carbon dioxide. And that's correct. Researchers have found that
745600	751520	carbon dioxide is not the cause of that warming. The critics are specifying that this happens at
751520	756320	the end of a glaciation and as we've seen the little bit of extra sunlight the Earth
756320	763280	receives at the end of a glaciation does indeed warm the Earth. As oceans warm dissolved CO2 is
763280	770160	less soluble and it's released into the atmosphere. CO2 and methane locked up in frozen soils is also
770160	777520	released and methane also breaks down into CO2. So it's no surprise that at the end of a glaciation,
777520	783440	which is the start of a period called deglaciation, CO2 lags temperature. The
783440	789360	problem is that the critics assume this means that CO2 can only lag temperature and that it
789360	796320	therefore can't be a greenhouse gas. But this focus only on the early stages of deglaciation
796320	801600	ignores the fact that research scientists say that in the latter stages of deglaciation
801600	807840	CO2 leads temperature. Just ask the researchers who are credited with making this graph,
807840	814800	Nicolas Cayon et al. Here's the original graph in the paper being referenced by the critics.
814800	820560	The authors explain how CO2 lags temperature in the early part of deglaciation in the southern
820560	826960	hemisphere but it leads temperature rise during the rest of deglaciation in the northern hemisphere.
827600	833280	The authors write, this sequence of events is still in full agreement with the idea that CO2
833280	839600	plays, through its greenhouse effect, a key role in amplifying the initial orbital forcing.
839600	844640	That means the Earth's wobble. Other researchers have found exactly the same thing.
846320	851760	So telling us that CO2 lags temperature rise at the end of a glaciation is correct.
851760	856480	But it's only telling half the story and sometimes the critics blur that.
856560	860480	CO2 clearly cannot be causing temperature changes.
860480	863840	It's a product of temperature. It's following temperature changes.
863840	869200	This is giving the impression that CO2 only ever lags temperature. Lots of people have
869200	872880	come onto my channel convinced that that's what the researchers have found.
874400	878480	The positive feedback doesn't go on forever, of course, because as the temperature of the
878480	883520	Earth rises it radiates more heat. So once the initial forcing has stopped,
883520	887280	the temperature keeps rising until the amount of heat leaving the Earth
887280	889200	balances the amount of heat coming in.
890480	895040	The Earth then stabilises at a higher temperature called the equilibrium temperature.
895920	900400	So the longer it takes to stop the CO2 forcing that we're experiencing now,
900400	903200	the longer it'll take for temperatures to stabilise
903200	906000	and the higher the final equilibrium temperature will be.
906000	915200	How much CO2 is up there anyway? 4% of that is due to man.
916000	922400	Human activity contributes perhaps 3% of the 3%.
923600	927680	No, the figure is actually 10 times higher. It's around 33%.
928640	933040	How do we know? Because since the Industrial Revolution, humans have poured hundreds of
933040	937760	billions of tonnes of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere and researchers can measure
937760	943600	where it's gone. About half has been dissolved in the oceans, where it's turned into carbonic acid,
943600	950560	and about half has accumulated in the atmosphere. That's why after about 8,000 years of CO2 levels
950560	958880	between 260 and 280 ppm, the concentration has risen to over 400 ppm since the Industrial
958880	965120	Revolution began 200 years ago. So where do the critics get this 3% figure from?
966080	972480	97% of all CO2 emitted every year around the world is naturally caused.
972480	978160	Only about 3% is from humans. We're creating only 3% of the Earth's CO2.
978160	983280	The biggest sources are decaying plants, volcanoes and forest fires.
983280	987280	But that's normal carbon flux. Since this is not explained,
987280	991200	it leads people to believe the figure refers to the human contribution to the
991200	996160	increase in atmospheric carbon dioxide. So what is carbon flux?
997280	1001920	Pence writes when he says the surface of the Earth is constantly expelling carbon dioxide
1001920	1007920	in a variety of ways. But what he doesn't mention is that at the same time it's reabsorbing
1007920	1014720	carbon dioxide in a variety of different ways. For every tree that dies and releases carbon dioxide,
1014720	1019920	another tree grows and absorbs it. The ocean is expelling carbon dioxide,
1019920	1023440	but it's also dissolving carbon dioxide, and so on.
1024160	1030640	So CO2 is constantly cycling in and out of the biosphere. And for the last 8,000 years,
1030640	1036000	since the end of the last glaciation, that recycling, called carbon flux,
1036000	1041440	has pretty much been in balance. In other words, very little of this carbon in circulation
1041440	1048400	accumulates and builds up in the atmosphere. The problem is into this balanced circulation system,
1048400	1052640	billions of tonnes of extra carbon has been introduced from a new source,
1052640	1056160	the burning of coal and oil that had previously been sequestered.
1056880	1061360	About half of this new carbon has been matched by ocean and biosphere absorption,
1061360	1066800	in other words it simply joined the carbon flux cycle. But the other half has been slowly
1066800	1070240	accumulating in the atmosphere since the industrial revolution.
1071120	1075760	That accumulation now comprises around a third of atmospheric CO2,
1075760	1079280	so it's the accumulated CO2 that has the warming effect.
1080320	1086640	In my video Are Humans Contributing Only 3% of CO2, I show the difference between carbon flux
1086640	1090720	and carbon accumulation, using the example of two tanks of water.
1091280	1096320	Water is going out of tank A into tank B at the rate of 100 litres a day,
1096320	1100880	at the same time water is being pumped from tank B into tank A at the same rate.
1101680	1104960	The result is that the level in tank A stays where it is.
1105600	1109920	But if we introduce water from a new source at the rate of 2 litres a day,
1109920	1114400	that's just 2% of the water in circulation, it steadily accumulates.
1114960	1119120	The level of water in tank A rises, and that's where the problem lies with
1119120	1123600	CO2 accumulating in the atmosphere, and that's what's causing the warming.
1125280	1129280	How do we know that the extra CO2 is from fossil fuel burning?
1129280	1136480	Because carbon has three main isotopes, carbon-12, the most common one, carbon-13 and carbon-14.
1137040	1141680	Unlike volcanoes, fossil fuels contain almost no carbon-13,
1141760	1145440	and unlike plants, they contain almost no carbon-14.
1146080	1150480	The evidence that the extra carbon that's accumulating is from fossil fuel burning,
1150480	1153200	rather than living matter or volcanoes,
1153200	1159360	is that the ratio of these C-13 and C-14 isotopes has gone down in the atmosphere and oceans.
1160720	1165280	If critics still want to insist that the CO2 isn't from fossil fuel burning,
1165280	1171040	then they have to explain how all this extra CO2 suddenly appeared in the atmosphere and oceans,
1171040	1174480	and they have to explain where the hundreds of billions of tonnes of
1174480	1179040	CO2 that humans have produced over the last 200 years has gone.
1182800	1186720	Can global warming be happening as expected if the world has stopped getting hotter?
1187600	1190560	The Earth basically has not been warming for the last 15 years or so.
1190560	1195040	No, the Earth has continued to warm, and this has been confirmed by every single
1195040	1199280	temperature monitoring body across the world, in a number of different countries.
1199840	1205680	It may be cold right now wherever you are, but these measurements are taken on a global scale,
1205680	1210480	on the ground, in the air and under the sea, and averaged over the entire year.
1211440	1216320	Hundreds of people from dozens of different scientific institutes all over the world
1216320	1221680	are involved in this process. Collectively and individually they all show that despite
1221680	1227200	lower solar irradiance and increased aerosol pollution, the Earth continues to warm.
1228160	1232000	Well, maybe the temperature data has been faked, the critics will say.
1232000	1236160	And even if there has been warming, it isn't as much as the models predicted.
1236160	1241680	And even if it is, warming will be good. And didn't they predict an ice age in the 1970s?
1241680	1245040	And aren't we expecting an ice age now, because the sun's about to go dim?
1245840	1251200	Yes, there are lots of other myths, I know, and unfortunately I can't cover them all in just one
1251200	1256560	video. But I have covered them all in my climate change series, so take a look and see what the
1257200	1263120	science has to say. But I hope the moral of this story is that if you want to call yourself a
1263120	1269280	sceptic, that's admirable, but in that case be sceptical. If you're told there's no correlation
1269280	1274720	between CO2 and temperature, then ask why researchers conclude that there is a link.
1275360	1280320	Find out what it is they know that the critics don't, or that the critics aren't telling you.
1281600	1285840	Instead of just accepting that the scientists must be wrong because someone tells you the
1285840	1291760	sun is causing global warming, turn that into a question. How come researchers don't think the
1291760	1297600	sun is responsible? Find out. And obviously, if only 3% of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere
1297600	1303440	is attributed to humans, then we don't have a problem, so why all the fuss? What is it that
1303440	1309440	the researchers know that the amateurs don't? Because either professional researchers are so
1309440	1314720	incompetent that in 120 years of published research they haven't spotted something so
1314720	1320800	simple and obvious that even an amateur can post it in a YouTube video, or they know something the
1320800	1328080	amateurs don't. Start by asking a question and finding the answer. As always, don't even believe
1328080	1333120	what I'm telling you either. Check my sources, which are in the video description and shown
1333120	1338160	on the screen, and see for yourself if the critics are telling you the whole story.
1338160	1341600	That's the hallmark of a true sceptic.
1344720	1346720	Thank you.
