00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,160
To those who don't know this channel, I'm a former geologist who's been a science journalist for

2
00:00:04,160 --> 00:00:10,640
25 years. My YouTube channel debunks all kinds of scientific urban myths. So here's a summary

3
00:00:10,640 --> 00:00:14,960
of the most common misrepresentations of science I've come across over the years

4
00:00:14,960 --> 00:00:19,680
regarding climate change, and the real science they're misrepresenting or omitting.

5
00:00:20,480 --> 00:00:24,320
Let's start with a famous myth about the name of the subject we're talking about.

6
00:00:24,320 --> 00:00:33,760
No, first of all, they started with global warming because they wanted to focus on CO2,

7
00:00:33,760 --> 00:00:36,080
and they started talking about climate change.

8
00:00:37,120 --> 00:00:39,520
That's why they call it climate change now and not global warming.

9
00:00:39,520 --> 00:00:44,560
No, it goes back a lot further than that. The conclusion that CO2 concentration affects

10
00:00:44,560 --> 00:00:50,560
global temperature was made 120 years ago and confirmed in the 1930s and 40s.

11
00:00:51,040 --> 00:00:56,320
In the 1950s, it became known as the carbon dioxide theory of climatic change,

12
00:00:56,320 --> 00:01:00,560
or climate change for short. This paper was written in 1955.

13
00:01:01,200 --> 00:01:05,440
That's why back in the 1980s, we saw the formation of something called

14
00:01:05,440 --> 00:01:08,400
the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change.

15
00:01:09,360 --> 00:01:14,320
The term global warming describes the global warming that causes this climate change.

16
00:01:16,240 --> 00:01:19,760
Climate changes all the time. It's a very natural thing.

17
00:01:19,760 --> 00:01:22,640
Climate change is a natural phenomenon that always will be.

18
00:01:23,600 --> 00:01:25,600
The climate change has always been occurring.

19
00:01:26,160 --> 00:01:31,120
How do you explain climate change that occurred 10,000 years ago before man had a carbon footprint?

20
00:01:32,080 --> 00:01:36,000
Because of course it's not the mere presence of humans that's changing the climate,

21
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:41,280
it's carbon dioxide. We know why carbon dioxide concentration is rising now,

22
00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:43,680
and geologists know why it rose in the past.

23
00:01:44,400 --> 00:01:49,680
First of all, let's get one thing clear. The main active drivers of global temperature now

24
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:53,680
are exactly the same as in the past, long before humans came along.

25
00:01:54,320 --> 00:01:58,720
Which shouldn't really be a surprise, because the laws of physics haven't changed.

26
00:01:58,720 --> 00:02:01,760
They're threefold. Changes in solar irradiance,

27
00:02:01,760 --> 00:02:04,000
which is the amount of heat we receive from the sun,

28
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:08,560
changes in carbon dioxide concentration, which traps that heat,

29
00:02:08,560 --> 00:02:12,320
and changes in aerosol concentration, which reflects that heat.

30
00:02:13,520 --> 00:02:16,480
Just to anticipate a few other myths that I'll cover later,

31
00:02:16,480 --> 00:02:20,320
things like water vapour content, cloud cover and ice albedo

32
00:02:20,320 --> 00:02:24,320
respond to these changes in temperature, but they aren't the primary causes.

33
00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:28,080
And although winds and oceans move the heat around,

34
00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:32,960
they don't significantly change the temperature of the earth, so they aren't active forcings either.

35
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:38,720
So how did carbon dioxide levels change before factories and SUVs came along?

36
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:44,000
Well, let's start at the beginning of the Phanerozoic, about 500 million years ago,

37
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:47,280
when CO2 levels were nearly 20 times higher than today.

38
00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:52,800
Over hundreds of millions of years they got taken out of the atmosphere by chemical weathering,

39
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:57,520
which turns the carbon dioxide into calcium carbonates and deposits it as sediment in the

40
00:02:57,520 --> 00:03:03,280
oceans. So trillions of tonnes of CO2 that were once in the atmosphere are now locked up in

41
00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:09,600
limestone. The other way CO2 got taken out was when living matter got buried as coal and oil.

42
00:03:10,320 --> 00:03:17,200
But this gradual decline in CO2 concentration is punctuated by sporadic increases in CO2 during

43
00:03:17,200 --> 00:03:22,400
flood basalt events â€“ occasional weaknesses in the earth's crust that spill thousands of

44
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:27,760
square miles of thick lava and release billions of tonnes of CO2 back into the atmosphere.

45
00:03:29,200 --> 00:03:34,000
So that brings us to the next myth. Since CO2 is a powerful greenhouse gas

46
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:39,200
and CO2 levels were much higher in the past, why was the earth sometimes colder?

47
00:03:39,600 --> 00:03:46,400
Here there was an ice age when CO2 was at least 10 times higher than it is today.

48
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:52,800
The reason is very simple. The sun was much weaker back then. Over the last 500 million years there's

49
00:03:52,800 --> 00:03:59,040
been a slow and steady increase in solar output. So during the late Ordovician, the time period

50
00:03:59,040 --> 00:04:05,360
Patrick Moore is talking about, solar output was about 4% lower than today. So it's no surprise

51
00:04:05,360 --> 00:04:11,360
that the earth was in an ice age. The question the critics need to answer is why was that the

52
00:04:11,360 --> 00:04:17,520
exception? Why was it much hotter than today for hundreds of millions of years either side of this

53
00:04:17,520 --> 00:04:28,080
brief ice age? And here we had almost 7,000 parts per million of CO2 compared with 385 or thereby

54
00:04:28,080 --> 00:04:35,200
today. 7,000 then. Temperature managed to get up to about 22 Celsius. That's the point. How did it

55
00:04:35,200 --> 00:04:41,280
manage to get up to 22 Celsius, which is 6 degrees hotter than today, even though the sun was about

56
00:04:41,280 --> 00:04:48,240
4% cooler? There's never been an answer from the critics, but scientists explain it quite easily.

57
00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:54,880
Since CO2 has a strong warming effect, it was this insulating blanket of CO2 that kept the earth

58
00:04:54,880 --> 00:05:00,320
warm. And researchers have found that the reason it cooled during the Ordovician was because a

59
00:05:00,320 --> 00:05:06,480
series of tectonic collisions led to a period of mountain building that sped up chemical weathering

60
00:05:06,480 --> 00:05:13,520
and took a lot of CO2 out of the atmosphere. As CO2 levels fell, the earth cooled and triggered

61
00:05:13,520 --> 00:05:19,920
an ice age. Since the increase in solar irradiance has been very slow and steady over the last 500

62
00:05:19,920 --> 00:05:25,360
million years, researchers have found that it's these sporadic increases and decreases in CO2

63
00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:31,680
levels that have largely driven global temperature. By the way, the graph Christopher Mungton is using

64
00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:37,440
is the same graph Patrick Moore was using, just in different colours. It comes from a blog.

65
00:05:37,440 --> 00:05:42,880
CO2 levels compiled by a researcher called Robert Berner, shown in black, have been put alongside

66
00:05:42,880 --> 00:05:48,240
global temperatures compiled by Christopher Scottese, shown in blue. Scottese drew the

67
00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:54,800
temperature sketch nearly 20 years ago based on a book that's now 26 years old, so he's recently

68
00:05:54,800 --> 00:05:59,920
updated it. This is Scottese's more accurate and more recent reconstruction.

69
00:06:03,840 --> 00:06:07,680
And look at how little correlation there is in that graph between

70
00:06:07,680 --> 00:06:13,600
temperature in blue there and CO2 concentration in black. And it shows very clearly that there's

71
00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:20,720
no lockstep correlation between CO2 and global temperature. But there's no lockstep correlation

72
00:06:20,720 --> 00:06:26,400
between solar irradiation and global temperature either. But surely we can't conclude from that

73
00:06:26,400 --> 00:06:32,560
that the Sun has no effect on global temperature. Since there are three main active drivers of

74
00:06:32,560 --> 00:06:37,600
global temperature, you can't just ignore the other two, you have to look at all three.

75
00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:42,960
And when you do that, you get a very good correlation. Correlation doesn't necessarily mean

76
00:06:42,960 --> 00:06:47,600
causation, of course, so in this video I'm not going to try to show you the evidence for the

77
00:06:47,600 --> 00:06:53,440
strong link between CO2 and global temperature. That's in another video I made. In this video,

78
00:06:53,440 --> 00:06:58,160
I'm just debunking the most widespread myths about climate science and the claim that there's

79
00:06:58,160 --> 00:07:04,960
no correlation is one of them. Now let's move forward in time to the present. And to do that,

80
00:07:04,960 --> 00:07:10,160
I want to give you an idea of the difference in time scale that represents. Let's take a walk up

81
00:07:10,160 --> 00:07:17,520
the Mississippi River from New Orleans to Memphis. That's 485 miles, so that represents about a mile

82
00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:23,280
for every million years of the Phanerozoic. It's a long walk that Google Maps reckons would take

83
00:07:23,280 --> 00:07:30,720
about a week non-stop. Only the last two miles represents our ice age and the last 40 years of

84
00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:36,480
strong warming is just a couple of inches. That's the period of time we're going to be looking at in

85
00:07:36,480 --> 00:07:42,960
the next couple of myths. So what do you think is causing global warming? The Sun. There's

86
00:07:42,960 --> 00:07:49,200
definitely no question. They virtually ignore the Sun as a factor of climate change. The Sun is

87
00:07:49,200 --> 00:07:55,840
driving climate change. CO2 is irrelevant. It's the Sun's stupid. So why do climate researchers

88
00:07:55,840 --> 00:08:01,920
say it's not the Sun? Because solar irradiance, shown here in blue, has been decreasing over the

89
00:08:01,920 --> 00:08:08,480
last 40 years, so it can't possibly have caused temperatures, shown in red, to go higher. The

90
00:08:08,480 --> 00:08:13,440
claim that the role of the Sun has been ignored by scientists is also wrong. Scientists have devoted

91
00:08:13,440 --> 00:08:18,800
a huge amount of effort into monitoring the output of the Sun and studying its effects on global

92
00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:24,640
temperature, both now and in the past. When I mentioned this before, people have been confused

93
00:08:24,640 --> 00:08:29,280
by the fact that the Sun has been getting cooler over the last 40 years, when I've also said that

94
00:08:29,280 --> 00:08:34,160
for the last 500 million years it's been getting hotter. That's because of the difference in

95
00:08:34,160 --> 00:08:40,000
magnitude and time scale. Here's where the time illustration will help. Because the growing output

96
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:46,960
of the Sun represents our uphill climb from New Orleans to Memphis. We're climbing 308 feet, which

97
00:08:46,960 --> 00:08:52,880
is quite a lot. It's the height of the Statue of Liberty. That represents the 4% increase in

98
00:08:52,880 --> 00:09:00,640
solar output. But over 485 miles you wouldn't even notice it. The road looks pretty flat. What you

99
00:09:00,640 --> 00:09:06,800
would notice are the very small dips and inclines over short periods. Even this wheelchair ramp down

100
00:09:06,800 --> 00:09:12,800
from a sidewalk onto the road represents a decrease in solar activity over hundreds of years, similar

101
00:09:12,800 --> 00:09:18,800
to the Little Ice Age. In other words, the tiny drop in solar irradiation over the last 40 years

102
00:09:18,800 --> 00:09:24,960
would go unnoticed when set against the huge rise in solar irradiation over the last 500 million

103
00:09:24,960 --> 00:09:31,760
years. And the other side of the coin is that the long-term rise in solar irradiation is so slow

104
00:09:31,760 --> 00:09:34,640
that it wouldn't even be noticed over a 40-year period.

105
00:09:38,240 --> 00:09:44,640
There are many more factors in play than simply the concentration of CO2 in the atmosphere.

106
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:50,880
Factors such as the shape and size of the Earth's elliptical orbit around the Sun.

107
00:09:50,960 --> 00:09:57,600
Lead scientist at NASA said this. He said that what ended the Ice Age was global wobbling.

108
00:09:57,600 --> 00:10:02,320
Is the wobbling of the Earth included in any of your modellings? And the answer was no.

109
00:10:02,320 --> 00:10:07,280
When you have a model and you say we're going to leave out the most important impact of that model

110
00:10:07,840 --> 00:10:13,680
out of our theory and not talk about global wobbling, how can you make projections?

111
00:10:13,680 --> 00:10:19,200
Because right now these wobbles are not affecting us. They're well known and very predictable.

112
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:22,800
At the moment there's a very small change over a period of thousands of years,

113
00:10:22,800 --> 00:10:27,360
but for reasons I've just explained this is too small to be measurable over a 40-year or

114
00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:32,320
100-year period. The last time the Earth's wobble had a significant effect was about

115
00:10:32,320 --> 00:10:37,360
15,000 years ago and the next time will be at least 16,000 years from now.

116
00:10:39,760 --> 00:10:44,000
Now one thing that kind of jumps out at you is, do they ever fit together?

117
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:49,520
But looks can be deceiving. Al Gore is glossing over the fact that the start of each deglaciation

118
00:10:49,520 --> 00:10:55,920
was not caused by CO2. It was caused, as we've seen, by a wobble in the Earth's axis and orbit

119
00:10:55,920 --> 00:11:01,280
that allowed a little more sunlight to hit the Earth. Over most of the Phanerozoic these wobbles

120
00:11:01,280 --> 00:11:07,360
have no discernible effect. The change in global temperature is too small. But an Ice Age is

121
00:11:07,360 --> 00:11:13,200
different because ice has properties that amplify the warming far more than when the Earth is ice

122
00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:19,520
free. When a small amount of ice melts less sunlight is reflected back into space and methane

123
00:11:19,520 --> 00:11:26,320
and carbon dioxide locked up in frozen soils and cold oceans are released and that causes more

124
00:11:26,320 --> 00:11:32,960
warming. The amount of extra sunlight the Earth receives due to its orbital wobbling isn't enough

125
00:11:32,960 --> 00:11:38,160
to melt ice sheets the size of continents. What does that are the amplifying factors,

126
00:11:38,160 --> 00:11:42,960
as we'll see when we move on to our next myth, the complete opposite of the previous one.

127
00:11:43,200 --> 00:11:51,440
So here we're looking at the ice core record from Vostok and in the red we see temperature

128
00:11:51,440 --> 00:11:58,000
going up from early time to later time at a very key interval when we came out of a glaciation

129
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:05,840
and we see the temperature going up and then we see the CO2 coming up. CO2 lags behind that

130
00:12:05,840 --> 00:12:11,840
increase. It's got an 800 year lag so temperature is leading CO2 by 800 years.

131
00:12:12,720 --> 00:12:20,000
So obviously carbon dioxide is not the cause of that warming. In fact we can say that the warming

132
00:12:20,800 --> 00:12:25,600
produced the increase in carbon dioxide. And that's correct. Researchers have found that

133
00:12:25,600 --> 00:12:31,520
carbon dioxide is not the cause of that warming. The critics are specifying that this happens at

134
00:12:31,520 --> 00:12:36,320
the end of a glaciation and as we've seen the little bit of extra sunlight the Earth

135
00:12:36,320 --> 00:12:43,280
receives at the end of a glaciation does indeed warm the Earth. As oceans warm dissolved CO2 is

136
00:12:43,280 --> 00:12:50,160
less soluble and it's released into the atmosphere. CO2 and methane locked up in frozen soils is also

137
00:12:50,160 --> 00:12:57,520
released and methane also breaks down into CO2. So it's no surprise that at the end of a glaciation,

138
00:12:57,520 --> 00:13:03,440
which is the start of a period called deglaciation, CO2 lags temperature. The

139
00:13:03,440 --> 00:13:09,360
problem is that the critics assume this means that CO2 can only lag temperature and that it

140
00:13:09,360 --> 00:13:16,320
therefore can't be a greenhouse gas. But this focus only on the early stages of deglaciation

141
00:13:16,320 --> 00:13:21,600
ignores the fact that research scientists say that in the latter stages of deglaciation

142
00:13:21,600 --> 00:13:27,840
CO2 leads temperature. Just ask the researchers who are credited with making this graph,

143
00:13:27,840 --> 00:13:34,800
Nicolas Cayon et al. Here's the original graph in the paper being referenced by the critics.

144
00:13:34,800 --> 00:13:40,560
The authors explain how CO2 lags temperature in the early part of deglaciation in the southern

145
00:13:40,560 --> 00:13:46,960
hemisphere but it leads temperature rise during the rest of deglaciation in the northern hemisphere.

146
00:13:47,600 --> 00:13:53,280
The authors write, this sequence of events is still in full agreement with the idea that CO2

147
00:13:53,280 --> 00:13:59,600
plays, through its greenhouse effect, a key role in amplifying the initial orbital forcing.

148
00:13:59,600 --> 00:14:04,640
That means the Earth's wobble. Other researchers have found exactly the same thing.

149
00:14:06,320 --> 00:14:11,760
So telling us that CO2 lags temperature rise at the end of a glaciation is correct.

150
00:14:11,760 --> 00:14:16,480
But it's only telling half the story and sometimes the critics blur that.

151
00:14:16,560 --> 00:14:20,480
CO2 clearly cannot be causing temperature changes.

152
00:14:20,480 --> 00:14:23,840
It's a product of temperature. It's following temperature changes.

153
00:14:23,840 --> 00:14:29,200
This is giving the impression that CO2 only ever lags temperature. Lots of people have

154
00:14:29,200 --> 00:14:32,880
come onto my channel convinced that that's what the researchers have found.

155
00:14:34,400 --> 00:14:38,480
The positive feedback doesn't go on forever, of course, because as the temperature of the

156
00:14:38,480 --> 00:14:43,520
Earth rises it radiates more heat. So once the initial forcing has stopped,

157
00:14:43,520 --> 00:14:47,280
the temperature keeps rising until the amount of heat leaving the Earth

158
00:14:47,280 --> 00:14:49,200
balances the amount of heat coming in.

159
00:14:50,480 --> 00:14:55,040
The Earth then stabilises at a higher temperature called the equilibrium temperature.

160
00:14:55,920 --> 00:15:00,400
So the longer it takes to stop the CO2 forcing that we're experiencing now,

161
00:15:00,400 --> 00:15:03,200
the longer it'll take for temperatures to stabilise

162
00:15:03,200 --> 00:15:06,000
and the higher the final equilibrium temperature will be.

163
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:15,200
How much CO2 is up there anyway? 4% of that is due to man.

164
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:22,400
Human activity contributes perhaps 3% of the 3%.

165
00:15:23,600 --> 00:15:27,680
No, the figure is actually 10 times higher. It's around 33%.

166
00:15:28,640 --> 00:15:33,040
How do we know? Because since the Industrial Revolution, humans have poured hundreds of

167
00:15:33,040 --> 00:15:37,760
billions of tonnes of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere and researchers can measure

168
00:15:37,760 --> 00:15:43,600
where it's gone. About half has been dissolved in the oceans, where it's turned into carbonic acid,

169
00:15:43,600 --> 00:15:50,560
and about half has accumulated in the atmosphere. That's why after about 8,000 years of CO2 levels

170
00:15:50,560 --> 00:15:58,880
between 260 and 280 ppm, the concentration has risen to over 400 ppm since the Industrial

171
00:15:58,880 --> 00:16:05,120
Revolution began 200 years ago. So where do the critics get this 3% figure from?

172
00:16:06,080 --> 00:16:12,480
97% of all CO2 emitted every year around the world is naturally caused.

173
00:16:12,480 --> 00:16:18,160
Only about 3% is from humans. We're creating only 3% of the Earth's CO2.

174
00:16:18,160 --> 00:16:23,280
The biggest sources are decaying plants, volcanoes and forest fires.

175
00:16:23,280 --> 00:16:27,280
But that's normal carbon flux. Since this is not explained,

176
00:16:27,280 --> 00:16:31,200
it leads people to believe the figure refers to the human contribution to the

177
00:16:31,200 --> 00:16:36,160
increase in atmospheric carbon dioxide. So what is carbon flux?

178
00:16:37,280 --> 00:16:41,920
Pence writes when he says the surface of the Earth is constantly expelling carbon dioxide

179
00:16:41,920 --> 00:16:47,920
in a variety of ways. But what he doesn't mention is that at the same time it's reabsorbing

180
00:16:47,920 --> 00:16:54,720
carbon dioxide in a variety of different ways. For every tree that dies and releases carbon dioxide,

181
00:16:54,720 --> 00:16:59,920
another tree grows and absorbs it. The ocean is expelling carbon dioxide,

182
00:16:59,920 --> 00:17:03,440
but it's also dissolving carbon dioxide, and so on.

183
00:17:04,160 --> 00:17:10,640
So CO2 is constantly cycling in and out of the biosphere. And for the last 8,000 years,

184
00:17:10,640 --> 00:17:16,000
since the end of the last glaciation, that recycling, called carbon flux,

185
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:21,440
has pretty much been in balance. In other words, very little of this carbon in circulation

186
00:17:21,440 --> 00:17:28,400
accumulates and builds up in the atmosphere. The problem is into this balanced circulation system,

187
00:17:28,400 --> 00:17:32,640
billions of tonnes of extra carbon has been introduced from a new source,

188
00:17:32,640 --> 00:17:36,160
the burning of coal and oil that had previously been sequestered.

189
00:17:36,880 --> 00:17:41,360
About half of this new carbon has been matched by ocean and biosphere absorption,

190
00:17:41,360 --> 00:17:46,800
in other words it simply joined the carbon flux cycle. But the other half has been slowly

191
00:17:46,800 --> 00:17:50,240
accumulating in the atmosphere since the industrial revolution.

192
00:17:51,120 --> 00:17:55,760
That accumulation now comprises around a third of atmospheric CO2,

193
00:17:55,760 --> 00:17:59,280
so it's the accumulated CO2 that has the warming effect.

194
00:18:00,320 --> 00:18:06,640
In my video Are Humans Contributing Only 3% of CO2, I show the difference between carbon flux

195
00:18:06,640 --> 00:18:10,720
and carbon accumulation, using the example of two tanks of water.

196
00:18:11,280 --> 00:18:16,320
Water is going out of tank A into tank B at the rate of 100 litres a day,

197
00:18:16,320 --> 00:18:20,880
at the same time water is being pumped from tank B into tank A at the same rate.

198
00:18:21,680 --> 00:18:24,960
The result is that the level in tank A stays where it is.

199
00:18:25,600 --> 00:18:29,920
But if we introduce water from a new source at the rate of 2 litres a day,

200
00:18:29,920 --> 00:18:34,400
that's just 2% of the water in circulation, it steadily accumulates.

201
00:18:34,960 --> 00:18:39,120
The level of water in tank A rises, and that's where the problem lies with

202
00:18:39,120 --> 00:18:43,600
CO2 accumulating in the atmosphere, and that's what's causing the warming.

203
00:18:45,280 --> 00:18:49,280
How do we know that the extra CO2 is from fossil fuel burning?

204
00:18:49,280 --> 00:18:56,480
Because carbon has three main isotopes, carbon-12, the most common one, carbon-13 and carbon-14.

205
00:18:57,040 --> 00:19:01,680
Unlike volcanoes, fossil fuels contain almost no carbon-13,

206
00:19:01,760 --> 00:19:05,440
and unlike plants, they contain almost no carbon-14.

207
00:19:06,080 --> 00:19:10,480
The evidence that the extra carbon that's accumulating is from fossil fuel burning,

208
00:19:10,480 --> 00:19:13,200
rather than living matter or volcanoes,

209
00:19:13,200 --> 00:19:19,360
is that the ratio of these C-13 and C-14 isotopes has gone down in the atmosphere and oceans.

210
00:19:20,720 --> 00:19:25,280
If critics still want to insist that the CO2 isn't from fossil fuel burning,

211
00:19:25,280 --> 00:19:31,040
then they have to explain how all this extra CO2 suddenly appeared in the atmosphere and oceans,

212
00:19:31,040 --> 00:19:34,480
and they have to explain where the hundreds of billions of tonnes of

213
00:19:34,480 --> 00:19:39,040
CO2 that humans have produced over the last 200 years has gone.

214
00:19:42,800 --> 00:19:46,720
Can global warming be happening as expected if the world has stopped getting hotter?

215
00:19:47,600 --> 00:19:50,560
The Earth basically has not been warming for the last 15 years or so.

216
00:19:50,560 --> 00:19:55,040
No, the Earth has continued to warm, and this has been confirmed by every single

217
00:19:55,040 --> 00:19:59,280
temperature monitoring body across the world, in a number of different countries.

218
00:19:59,840 --> 00:20:05,680
It may be cold right now wherever you are, but these measurements are taken on a global scale,

219
00:20:05,680 --> 00:20:10,480
on the ground, in the air and under the sea, and averaged over the entire year.

220
00:20:11,440 --> 00:20:16,320
Hundreds of people from dozens of different scientific institutes all over the world

221
00:20:16,320 --> 00:20:21,680
are involved in this process. Collectively and individually they all show that despite

222
00:20:21,680 --> 00:20:27,200
lower solar irradiance and increased aerosol pollution, the Earth continues to warm.

223
00:20:28,160 --> 00:20:32,000
Well, maybe the temperature data has been faked, the critics will say.

224
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:36,160
And even if there has been warming, it isn't as much as the models predicted.

225
00:20:36,160 --> 00:20:41,680
And even if it is, warming will be good. And didn't they predict an ice age in the 1970s?

226
00:20:41,680 --> 00:20:45,040
And aren't we expecting an ice age now, because the sun's about to go dim?

227
00:20:45,840 --> 00:20:51,200
Yes, there are lots of other myths, I know, and unfortunately I can't cover them all in just one

228
00:20:51,200 --> 00:20:56,560
video. But I have covered them all in my climate change series, so take a look and see what the

229
00:20:57,200 --> 00:21:03,120
science has to say. But I hope the moral of this story is that if you want to call yourself a

230
00:21:03,120 --> 00:21:09,280
sceptic, that's admirable, but in that case be sceptical. If you're told there's no correlation

231
00:21:09,280 --> 00:21:14,720
between CO2 and temperature, then ask why researchers conclude that there is a link.

232
00:21:15,360 --> 00:21:20,320
Find out what it is they know that the critics don't, or that the critics aren't telling you.

233
00:21:21,600 --> 00:21:25,840
Instead of just accepting that the scientists must be wrong because someone tells you the

234
00:21:25,840 --> 00:21:31,760
sun is causing global warming, turn that into a question. How come researchers don't think the

235
00:21:31,760 --> 00:21:37,600
sun is responsible? Find out. And obviously, if only 3% of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere

236
00:21:37,600 --> 00:21:43,440
is attributed to humans, then we don't have a problem, so why all the fuss? What is it that

237
00:21:43,440 --> 00:21:49,440
the researchers know that the amateurs don't? Because either professional researchers are so

238
00:21:49,440 --> 00:21:54,720
incompetent that in 120 years of published research they haven't spotted something so

239
00:21:54,720 --> 00:22:00,800
simple and obvious that even an amateur can post it in a YouTube video, or they know something the

240
00:22:00,800 --> 00:22:08,080
amateurs don't. Start by asking a question and finding the answer. As always, don't even believe

241
00:22:08,080 --> 00:22:13,120
what I'm telling you either. Check my sources, which are in the video description and shown

242
00:22:13,120 --> 00:22:18,160
on the screen, and see for yourself if the critics are telling you the whole story.

243
00:22:18,160 --> 00:22:21,600
That's the hallmark of a true sceptic.

244
00:22:24,720 --> 00:22:26,720
Thank you.
