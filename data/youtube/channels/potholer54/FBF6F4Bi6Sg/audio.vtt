00:00.000 --> 00:04.160
To those who don't know this channel, I'm a former geologist who's been a science journalist for

00:04.160 --> 00:10.640
25 years. My YouTube channel debunks all kinds of scientific urban myths. So here's a summary

00:10.640 --> 00:14.960
of the most common misrepresentations of science I've come across over the years

00:14.960 --> 00:19.680
regarding climate change, and the real science they're misrepresenting or omitting.

00:20.480 --> 00:24.320
Let's start with a famous myth about the name of the subject we're talking about.

00:24.320 --> 00:33.760
No, first of all, they started with global warming because they wanted to focus on CO2,

00:33.760 --> 00:36.080
and they started talking about climate change.

00:37.120 --> 00:39.520
That's why they call it climate change now and not global warming.

00:39.520 --> 00:44.560
No, it goes back a lot further than that. The conclusion that CO2 concentration affects

00:44.560 --> 00:50.560
global temperature was made 120 years ago and confirmed in the 1930s and 40s.

00:51.040 --> 00:56.320
In the 1950s, it became known as the carbon dioxide theory of climatic change,

00:56.320 --> 01:00.560
or climate change for short. This paper was written in 1955.

01:01.200 --> 01:05.440
That's why back in the 1980s, we saw the formation of something called

01:05.440 --> 01:08.400
the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change.

01:09.360 --> 01:14.320
The term global warming describes the global warming that causes this climate change.

01:16.240 --> 01:19.760
Climate changes all the time. It's a very natural thing.

01:19.760 --> 01:22.640
Climate change is a natural phenomenon that always will be.

01:23.600 --> 01:25.600
The climate change has always been occurring.

01:26.160 --> 01:31.120
How do you explain climate change that occurred 10,000 years ago before man had a carbon footprint?

01:32.080 --> 01:36.000
Because of course it's not the mere presence of humans that's changing the climate,

01:36.000 --> 01:41.280
it's carbon dioxide. We know why carbon dioxide concentration is rising now,

01:41.280 --> 01:43.680
and geologists know why it rose in the past.

01:44.400 --> 01:49.680
First of all, let's get one thing clear. The main active drivers of global temperature now

01:49.680 --> 01:53.680
are exactly the same as in the past, long before humans came along.

01:54.320 --> 01:58.720
Which shouldn't really be a surprise, because the laws of physics haven't changed.

01:58.720 --> 02:01.760
They're threefold. Changes in solar irradiance,

02:01.760 --> 02:04.000
which is the amount of heat we receive from the sun,

02:04.560 --> 02:08.560
changes in carbon dioxide concentration, which traps that heat,

02:08.560 --> 02:12.320
and changes in aerosol concentration, which reflects that heat.

02:13.520 --> 02:16.480
Just to anticipate a few other myths that I'll cover later,

02:16.480 --> 02:20.320
things like water vapour content, cloud cover and ice albedo

02:20.320 --> 02:24.320
respond to these changes in temperature, but they aren't the primary causes.

02:25.200 --> 02:28.080
And although winds and oceans move the heat around,

02:28.080 --> 02:32.960
they don't significantly change the temperature of the earth, so they aren't active forcings either.

02:34.000 --> 02:38.720
So how did carbon dioxide levels change before factories and SUVs came along?

02:39.840 --> 02:44.000
Well, let's start at the beginning of the Phanerozoic, about 500 million years ago,

02:44.000 --> 02:47.280
when CO2 levels were nearly 20 times higher than today.

02:47.840 --> 02:52.800
Over hundreds of millions of years they got taken out of the atmosphere by chemical weathering,

02:52.800 --> 02:57.520
which turns the carbon dioxide into calcium carbonates and deposits it as sediment in the

02:57.520 --> 03:03.280
oceans. So trillions of tonnes of CO2 that were once in the atmosphere are now locked up in

03:03.280 --> 03:09.600
limestone. The other way CO2 got taken out was when living matter got buried as coal and oil.

03:10.320 --> 03:17.200
But this gradual decline in CO2 concentration is punctuated by sporadic increases in CO2 during

03:17.200 --> 03:22.400
flood basalt events â€“ occasional weaknesses in the earth's crust that spill thousands of

03:22.400 --> 03:27.760
square miles of thick lava and release billions of tonnes of CO2 back into the atmosphere.

03:29.200 --> 03:34.000
So that brings us to the next myth. Since CO2 is a powerful greenhouse gas

03:34.000 --> 03:39.200
and CO2 levels were much higher in the past, why was the earth sometimes colder?

03:39.600 --> 03:46.400
Here there was an ice age when CO2 was at least 10 times higher than it is today.

03:46.400 --> 03:52.800
The reason is very simple. The sun was much weaker back then. Over the last 500 million years there's

03:52.800 --> 03:59.040
been a slow and steady increase in solar output. So during the late Ordovician, the time period

03:59.040 --> 04:05.360
Patrick Moore is talking about, solar output was about 4% lower than today. So it's no surprise

04:05.360 --> 04:11.360
that the earth was in an ice age. The question the critics need to answer is why was that the

04:11.360 --> 04:17.520
exception? Why was it much hotter than today for hundreds of millions of years either side of this

04:17.520 --> 04:28.080
brief ice age? And here we had almost 7,000 parts per million of CO2 compared with 385 or thereby

04:28.080 --> 04:35.200
today. 7,000 then. Temperature managed to get up to about 22 Celsius. That's the point. How did it

04:35.200 --> 04:41.280
manage to get up to 22 Celsius, which is 6 degrees hotter than today, even though the sun was about

04:41.280 --> 04:48.240
4% cooler? There's never been an answer from the critics, but scientists explain it quite easily.

04:48.240 --> 04:54.880
Since CO2 has a strong warming effect, it was this insulating blanket of CO2 that kept the earth

04:54.880 --> 05:00.320
warm. And researchers have found that the reason it cooled during the Ordovician was because a

05:00.320 --> 05:06.480
series of tectonic collisions led to a period of mountain building that sped up chemical weathering

05:06.480 --> 05:13.520
and took a lot of CO2 out of the atmosphere. As CO2 levels fell, the earth cooled and triggered

05:13.520 --> 05:19.920
an ice age. Since the increase in solar irradiance has been very slow and steady over the last 500

05:19.920 --> 05:25.360
million years, researchers have found that it's these sporadic increases and decreases in CO2

05:25.360 --> 05:31.680
levels that have largely driven global temperature. By the way, the graph Christopher Mungton is using

05:31.680 --> 05:37.440
is the same graph Patrick Moore was using, just in different colours. It comes from a blog.

05:37.440 --> 05:42.880
CO2 levels compiled by a researcher called Robert Berner, shown in black, have been put alongside

05:42.880 --> 05:48.240
global temperatures compiled by Christopher Scottese, shown in blue. Scottese drew the

05:48.240 --> 05:54.800
temperature sketch nearly 20 years ago based on a book that's now 26 years old, so he's recently

05:54.800 --> 05:59.920
updated it. This is Scottese's more accurate and more recent reconstruction.

06:03.840 --> 06:07.680
And look at how little correlation there is in that graph between

06:07.680 --> 06:13.600
temperature in blue there and CO2 concentration in black. And it shows very clearly that there's

06:13.600 --> 06:20.720
no lockstep correlation between CO2 and global temperature. But there's no lockstep correlation

06:20.720 --> 06:26.400
between solar irradiation and global temperature either. But surely we can't conclude from that

06:26.400 --> 06:32.560
that the Sun has no effect on global temperature. Since there are three main active drivers of

06:32.560 --> 06:37.600
global temperature, you can't just ignore the other two, you have to look at all three.

06:37.600 --> 06:42.960
And when you do that, you get a very good correlation. Correlation doesn't necessarily mean

06:42.960 --> 06:47.600
causation, of course, so in this video I'm not going to try to show you the evidence for the

06:47.600 --> 06:53.440
strong link between CO2 and global temperature. That's in another video I made. In this video,

06:53.440 --> 06:58.160
I'm just debunking the most widespread myths about climate science and the claim that there's

06:58.160 --> 07:04.960
no correlation is one of them. Now let's move forward in time to the present. And to do that,

07:04.960 --> 07:10.160
I want to give you an idea of the difference in time scale that represents. Let's take a walk up

07:10.160 --> 07:17.520
the Mississippi River from New Orleans to Memphis. That's 485 miles, so that represents about a mile

07:17.520 --> 07:23.280
for every million years of the Phanerozoic. It's a long walk that Google Maps reckons would take

07:23.280 --> 07:30.720
about a week non-stop. Only the last two miles represents our ice age and the last 40 years of

07:30.720 --> 07:36.480
strong warming is just a couple of inches. That's the period of time we're going to be looking at in

07:36.480 --> 07:42.960
the next couple of myths. So what do you think is causing global warming? The Sun. There's

07:42.960 --> 07:49.200
definitely no question. They virtually ignore the Sun as a factor of climate change. The Sun is

07:49.200 --> 07:55.840
driving climate change. CO2 is irrelevant. It's the Sun's stupid. So why do climate researchers

07:55.840 --> 08:01.920
say it's not the Sun? Because solar irradiance, shown here in blue, has been decreasing over the

08:01.920 --> 08:08.480
last 40 years, so it can't possibly have caused temperatures, shown in red, to go higher. The

08:08.480 --> 08:13.440
claim that the role of the Sun has been ignored by scientists is also wrong. Scientists have devoted

08:13.440 --> 08:18.800
a huge amount of effort into monitoring the output of the Sun and studying its effects on global

08:18.800 --> 08:24.640
temperature, both now and in the past. When I mentioned this before, people have been confused

08:24.640 --> 08:29.280
by the fact that the Sun has been getting cooler over the last 40 years, when I've also said that

08:29.280 --> 08:34.160
for the last 500 million years it's been getting hotter. That's because of the difference in

08:34.160 --> 08:40.000
magnitude and time scale. Here's where the time illustration will help. Because the growing output

08:40.000 --> 08:46.960
of the Sun represents our uphill climb from New Orleans to Memphis. We're climbing 308 feet, which

08:46.960 --> 08:52.880
is quite a lot. It's the height of the Statue of Liberty. That represents the 4% increase in

08:52.880 --> 09:00.640
solar output. But over 485 miles you wouldn't even notice it. The road looks pretty flat. What you

09:00.640 --> 09:06.800
would notice are the very small dips and inclines over short periods. Even this wheelchair ramp down

09:06.800 --> 09:12.800
from a sidewalk onto the road represents a decrease in solar activity over hundreds of years, similar

09:12.800 --> 09:18.800
to the Little Ice Age. In other words, the tiny drop in solar irradiation over the last 40 years

09:18.800 --> 09:24.960
would go unnoticed when set against the huge rise in solar irradiation over the last 500 million

09:24.960 --> 09:31.760
years. And the other side of the coin is that the long-term rise in solar irradiation is so slow

09:31.760 --> 09:34.640
that it wouldn't even be noticed over a 40-year period.

09:38.240 --> 09:44.640
There are many more factors in play than simply the concentration of CO2 in the atmosphere.

09:46.000 --> 09:50.880
Factors such as the shape and size of the Earth's elliptical orbit around the Sun.

09:50.960 --> 09:57.600
Lead scientist at NASA said this. He said that what ended the Ice Age was global wobbling.

09:57.600 --> 10:02.320
Is the wobbling of the Earth included in any of your modellings? And the answer was no.

10:02.320 --> 10:07.280
When you have a model and you say we're going to leave out the most important impact of that model

10:07.840 --> 10:13.680
out of our theory and not talk about global wobbling, how can you make projections?

10:13.680 --> 10:19.200
Because right now these wobbles are not affecting us. They're well known and very predictable.

10:19.200 --> 10:22.800
At the moment there's a very small change over a period of thousands of years,

10:22.800 --> 10:27.360
but for reasons I've just explained this is too small to be measurable over a 40-year or

10:27.360 --> 10:32.320
100-year period. The last time the Earth's wobble had a significant effect was about

10:32.320 --> 10:37.360
15,000 years ago and the next time will be at least 16,000 years from now.

10:39.760 --> 10:44.000
Now one thing that kind of jumps out at you is, do they ever fit together?

10:44.000 --> 10:49.520
But looks can be deceiving. Al Gore is glossing over the fact that the start of each deglaciation

10:49.520 --> 10:55.920
was not caused by CO2. It was caused, as we've seen, by a wobble in the Earth's axis and orbit

10:55.920 --> 11:01.280
that allowed a little more sunlight to hit the Earth. Over most of the Phanerozoic these wobbles

11:01.280 --> 11:07.360
have no discernible effect. The change in global temperature is too small. But an Ice Age is

11:07.360 --> 11:13.200
different because ice has properties that amplify the warming far more than when the Earth is ice

11:13.200 --> 11:19.520
free. When a small amount of ice melts less sunlight is reflected back into space and methane

11:19.520 --> 11:26.320
and carbon dioxide locked up in frozen soils and cold oceans are released and that causes more

11:26.320 --> 11:32.960
warming. The amount of extra sunlight the Earth receives due to its orbital wobbling isn't enough

11:32.960 --> 11:38.160
to melt ice sheets the size of continents. What does that are the amplifying factors,

11:38.160 --> 11:42.960
as we'll see when we move on to our next myth, the complete opposite of the previous one.

11:43.200 --> 11:51.440
So here we're looking at the ice core record from Vostok and in the red we see temperature

11:51.440 --> 11:58.000
going up from early time to later time at a very key interval when we came out of a glaciation

11:58.000 --> 12:05.840
and we see the temperature going up and then we see the CO2 coming up. CO2 lags behind that

12:05.840 --> 12:11.840
increase. It's got an 800 year lag so temperature is leading CO2 by 800 years.

12:12.720 --> 12:20.000
So obviously carbon dioxide is not the cause of that warming. In fact we can say that the warming

12:20.800 --> 12:25.600
produced the increase in carbon dioxide. And that's correct. Researchers have found that

12:25.600 --> 12:31.520
carbon dioxide is not the cause of that warming. The critics are specifying that this happens at

12:31.520 --> 12:36.320
the end of a glaciation and as we've seen the little bit of extra sunlight the Earth

12:36.320 --> 12:43.280
receives at the end of a glaciation does indeed warm the Earth. As oceans warm dissolved CO2 is

12:43.280 --> 12:50.160
less soluble and it's released into the atmosphere. CO2 and methane locked up in frozen soils is also

12:50.160 --> 12:57.520
released and methane also breaks down into CO2. So it's no surprise that at the end of a glaciation,

12:57.520 --> 13:03.440
which is the start of a period called deglaciation, CO2 lags temperature. The

13:03.440 --> 13:09.360
problem is that the critics assume this means that CO2 can only lag temperature and that it

13:09.360 --> 13:16.320
therefore can't be a greenhouse gas. But this focus only on the early stages of deglaciation

13:16.320 --> 13:21.600
ignores the fact that research scientists say that in the latter stages of deglaciation

13:21.600 --> 13:27.840
CO2 leads temperature. Just ask the researchers who are credited with making this graph,

13:27.840 --> 13:34.800
Nicolas Cayon et al. Here's the original graph in the paper being referenced by the critics.

13:34.800 --> 13:40.560
The authors explain how CO2 lags temperature in the early part of deglaciation in the southern

13:40.560 --> 13:46.960
hemisphere but it leads temperature rise during the rest of deglaciation in the northern hemisphere.

13:47.600 --> 13:53.280
The authors write, this sequence of events is still in full agreement with the idea that CO2

13:53.280 --> 13:59.600
plays, through its greenhouse effect, a key role in amplifying the initial orbital forcing.

13:59.600 --> 14:04.640
That means the Earth's wobble. Other researchers have found exactly the same thing.

14:06.320 --> 14:11.760
So telling us that CO2 lags temperature rise at the end of a glaciation is correct.

14:11.760 --> 14:16.480
But it's only telling half the story and sometimes the critics blur that.

14:16.560 --> 14:20.480
CO2 clearly cannot be causing temperature changes.

14:20.480 --> 14:23.840
It's a product of temperature. It's following temperature changes.

14:23.840 --> 14:29.200
This is giving the impression that CO2 only ever lags temperature. Lots of people have

14:29.200 --> 14:32.880
come onto my channel convinced that that's what the researchers have found.

14:34.400 --> 14:38.480
The positive feedback doesn't go on forever, of course, because as the temperature of the

14:38.480 --> 14:43.520
Earth rises it radiates more heat. So once the initial forcing has stopped,

14:43.520 --> 14:47.280
the temperature keeps rising until the amount of heat leaving the Earth

14:47.280 --> 14:49.200
balances the amount of heat coming in.

14:50.480 --> 14:55.040
The Earth then stabilises at a higher temperature called the equilibrium temperature.

14:55.920 --> 15:00.400
So the longer it takes to stop the CO2 forcing that we're experiencing now,

15:00.400 --> 15:03.200
the longer it'll take for temperatures to stabilise

15:03.200 --> 15:06.000
and the higher the final equilibrium temperature will be.

15:06.000 --> 15:15.200
How much CO2 is up there anyway? 4% of that is due to man.

15:16.000 --> 15:22.400
Human activity contributes perhaps 3% of the 3%.

15:23.600 --> 15:27.680
No, the figure is actually 10 times higher. It's around 33%.

15:28.640 --> 15:33.040
How do we know? Because since the Industrial Revolution, humans have poured hundreds of

15:33.040 --> 15:37.760
billions of tonnes of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere and researchers can measure

15:37.760 --> 15:43.600
where it's gone. About half has been dissolved in the oceans, where it's turned into carbonic acid,

15:43.600 --> 15:50.560
and about half has accumulated in the atmosphere. That's why after about 8,000 years of CO2 levels

15:50.560 --> 15:58.880
between 260 and 280 ppm, the concentration has risen to over 400 ppm since the Industrial

15:58.880 --> 16:05.120
Revolution began 200 years ago. So where do the critics get this 3% figure from?

16:06.080 --> 16:12.480
97% of all CO2 emitted every year around the world is naturally caused.

16:12.480 --> 16:18.160
Only about 3% is from humans. We're creating only 3% of the Earth's CO2.

16:18.160 --> 16:23.280
The biggest sources are decaying plants, volcanoes and forest fires.

16:23.280 --> 16:27.280
But that's normal carbon flux. Since this is not explained,

16:27.280 --> 16:31.200
it leads people to believe the figure refers to the human contribution to the

16:31.200 --> 16:36.160
increase in atmospheric carbon dioxide. So what is carbon flux?

16:37.280 --> 16:41.920
Pence writes when he says the surface of the Earth is constantly expelling carbon dioxide

16:41.920 --> 16:47.920
in a variety of ways. But what he doesn't mention is that at the same time it's reabsorbing

16:47.920 --> 16:54.720
carbon dioxide in a variety of different ways. For every tree that dies and releases carbon dioxide,

16:54.720 --> 16:59.920
another tree grows and absorbs it. The ocean is expelling carbon dioxide,

16:59.920 --> 17:03.440
but it's also dissolving carbon dioxide, and so on.

17:04.160 --> 17:10.640
So CO2 is constantly cycling in and out of the biosphere. And for the last 8,000 years,

17:10.640 --> 17:16.000
since the end of the last glaciation, that recycling, called carbon flux,

17:16.000 --> 17:21.440
has pretty much been in balance. In other words, very little of this carbon in circulation

17:21.440 --> 17:28.400
accumulates and builds up in the atmosphere. The problem is into this balanced circulation system,

17:28.400 --> 17:32.640
billions of tonnes of extra carbon has been introduced from a new source,

17:32.640 --> 17:36.160
the burning of coal and oil that had previously been sequestered.

17:36.880 --> 17:41.360
About half of this new carbon has been matched by ocean and biosphere absorption,

17:41.360 --> 17:46.800
in other words it simply joined the carbon flux cycle. But the other half has been slowly

17:46.800 --> 17:50.240
accumulating in the atmosphere since the industrial revolution.

17:51.120 --> 17:55.760
That accumulation now comprises around a third of atmospheric CO2,

17:55.760 --> 17:59.280
so it's the accumulated CO2 that has the warming effect.

18:00.320 --> 18:06.640
In my video Are Humans Contributing Only 3% of CO2, I show the difference between carbon flux

18:06.640 --> 18:10.720
and carbon accumulation, using the example of two tanks of water.

18:11.280 --> 18:16.320
Water is going out of tank A into tank B at the rate of 100 litres a day,

18:16.320 --> 18:20.880
at the same time water is being pumped from tank B into tank A at the same rate.

18:21.680 --> 18:24.960
The result is that the level in tank A stays where it is.

18:25.600 --> 18:29.920
But if we introduce water from a new source at the rate of 2 litres a day,

18:29.920 --> 18:34.400
that's just 2% of the water in circulation, it steadily accumulates.

18:34.960 --> 18:39.120
The level of water in tank A rises, and that's where the problem lies with

18:39.120 --> 18:43.600
CO2 accumulating in the atmosphere, and that's what's causing the warming.

18:45.280 --> 18:49.280
How do we know that the extra CO2 is from fossil fuel burning?

18:49.280 --> 18:56.480
Because carbon has three main isotopes, carbon-12, the most common one, carbon-13 and carbon-14.

18:57.040 --> 19:01.680
Unlike volcanoes, fossil fuels contain almost no carbon-13,

19:01.760 --> 19:05.440
and unlike plants, they contain almost no carbon-14.

19:06.080 --> 19:10.480
The evidence that the extra carbon that's accumulating is from fossil fuel burning,

19:10.480 --> 19:13.200
rather than living matter or volcanoes,

19:13.200 --> 19:19.360
is that the ratio of these C-13 and C-14 isotopes has gone down in the atmosphere and oceans.

19:20.720 --> 19:25.280
If critics still want to insist that the CO2 isn't from fossil fuel burning,

19:25.280 --> 19:31.040
then they have to explain how all this extra CO2 suddenly appeared in the atmosphere and oceans,

19:31.040 --> 19:34.480
and they have to explain where the hundreds of billions of tonnes of

19:34.480 --> 19:39.040
CO2 that humans have produced over the last 200 years has gone.

19:42.800 --> 19:46.720
Can global warming be happening as expected if the world has stopped getting hotter?

19:47.600 --> 19:50.560
The Earth basically has not been warming for the last 15 years or so.

19:50.560 --> 19:55.040
No, the Earth has continued to warm, and this has been confirmed by every single

19:55.040 --> 19:59.280
temperature monitoring body across the world, in a number of different countries.

19:59.840 --> 20:05.680
It may be cold right now wherever you are, but these measurements are taken on a global scale,

20:05.680 --> 20:10.480
on the ground, in the air and under the sea, and averaged over the entire year.

20:11.440 --> 20:16.320
Hundreds of people from dozens of different scientific institutes all over the world

20:16.320 --> 20:21.680
are involved in this process. Collectively and individually they all show that despite

20:21.680 --> 20:27.200
lower solar irradiance and increased aerosol pollution, the Earth continues to warm.

20:28.160 --> 20:32.000
Well, maybe the temperature data has been faked, the critics will say.

20:32.000 --> 20:36.160
And even if there has been warming, it isn't as much as the models predicted.

20:36.160 --> 20:41.680
And even if it is, warming will be good. And didn't they predict an ice age in the 1970s?

20:41.680 --> 20:45.040
And aren't we expecting an ice age now, because the sun's about to go dim?

20:45.840 --> 20:51.200
Yes, there are lots of other myths, I know, and unfortunately I can't cover them all in just one

20:51.200 --> 20:56.560
video. But I have covered them all in my climate change series, so take a look and see what the

20:57.200 --> 21:03.120
science has to say. But I hope the moral of this story is that if you want to call yourself a

21:03.120 --> 21:09.280
sceptic, that's admirable, but in that case be sceptical. If you're told there's no correlation

21:09.280 --> 21:14.720
between CO2 and temperature, then ask why researchers conclude that there is a link.

21:15.360 --> 21:20.320
Find out what it is they know that the critics don't, or that the critics aren't telling you.

21:21.600 --> 21:25.840
Instead of just accepting that the scientists must be wrong because someone tells you the

21:25.840 --> 21:31.760
sun is causing global warming, turn that into a question. How come researchers don't think the

21:31.760 --> 21:37.600
sun is responsible? Find out. And obviously, if only 3% of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere

21:37.600 --> 21:43.440
is attributed to humans, then we don't have a problem, so why all the fuss? What is it that

21:43.440 --> 21:49.440
the researchers know that the amateurs don't? Because either professional researchers are so

21:49.440 --> 21:54.720
incompetent that in 120 years of published research they haven't spotted something so

21:54.720 --> 22:00.800
simple and obvious that even an amateur can post it in a YouTube video, or they know something the

22:00.800 --> 22:08.080
amateurs don't. Start by asking a question and finding the answer. As always, don't even believe

22:08.080 --> 22:13.120
what I'm telling you either. Check my sources, which are in the video description and shown

22:13.120 --> 22:18.160
on the screen, and see for yourself if the critics are telling you the whole story.

22:18.160 --> 22:21.600
That's the hallmark of a true sceptic.

22:24.720 --> 22:26.720
Thank you.
