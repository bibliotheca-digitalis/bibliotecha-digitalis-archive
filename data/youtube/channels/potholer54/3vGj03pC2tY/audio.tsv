0	5980	Contrary to the media narrative, COVID-19 treatment with hydroxychloroquine is a safe
5980	6980	and generic...
6980	10860	Whoa, before people start reaching for the fish tank cleaner and YouTube blocks this
10860	15120	video, let me jump in quickly and say that this is crap.
15120	19760	So don't take medical advice from television pundits on Sky News.
19760	23840	I'm going to look at the rise and fall of a therapy that was passionately championed
23840	29120	in some sections of the media and the dangers of mixing politics and medicine.
29240	34120	I'm going to look at the scientific reasons why hydroxychloroquine hasn't been approved
34120	40800	by the FDA, the Therapeutics Goods Administration of Australia, the PFSB of Japan, and just
40800	46120	about every major pharmaceutical authority in Europe except, I think, for Italy.
46120	48720	Is this because Donald Trump has spoken in favour of it, do you reckon?
48720	54160	No, Alan, it's because nearly every study that's been done shows that hydroxychloroquine
54160	56480	isn't an effective treatment.
56480	60840	That may be hard to fathom if you ignore most of the science and only have a flawed,
60840	63440	narrow and selective understanding of the research.
63440	68620	In a new study, Smith and three other medical experts prove what he and his This Show have
68620	73540	been telling you for more than a year, that hydroxychloroquine can save lives.
73540	78040	But this wasn't a published clinical study or a randomized trial.
78040	83600	It was an observational study made by a group of doctors that was posted online.
83600	88480	There certainly have been a few studies that found hydroxychloroquine might be beneficial,
88480	93200	like this study by Achad et al. published in May 2020.
93200	97200	But for all the hype it was given in some sections of the media, you wouldn't know that
97200	101600	it was not a randomized control study and that it had a caveat.
101600	107840	Well, a new hydroxychloroquine study has just dropped and it could have all those experts
107840	108840	eating their words.
108840	115360	The Henry Ford Health System in Michigan tonight is announcing that hydroxychloroquine significantly
115360	120680	reduced death rates among sick and hospitalized COVID patients.
120680	123240	No, it didn't say that at all.
123240	128940	What it actually concluded was that treatment with hydroxychloroquine alone and in combination
128940	135620	with azithromycin was associated with a reduction in COVID-19-associated mortality.
135620	139120	An association is not the same as cause and effect.
139120	142860	For that, the study recommends prospective trials.
142860	144660	And these were done.
144660	149740	When taken in their totality, rather than picking just one or two for a TV program,
149740	153800	they show that hydroxychloroquine is ineffective.
153800	160540	This review found no benefit on viral clearance but a significant increase in mortality.
160540	165060	All these studies can be found in the review linked in the video description, as are my
165060	169900	other sources, so you can check all these studies yourselves.
169900	176880	And this review of studies looking at hydroxychloroquine as a prophylaxis also found that it was ineffective.
176880	181820	The key message from completed studies and randomized control trials seems to be that
181820	185520	hydroxychloroquine does not work.
185520	190460	An editorial in the Journal of the American Medical Association also summarized the findings
190460	192720	of all the studies.
192720	198280	These well-conducted trials, it said, including the study reported in this issue of JAMA,
198280	204680	demonstrate the lack of efficacy of hydroxychloroquine in patients with COVID-19.
204680	209480	They have been ignored by many TV pundits in favour of trumpeting just a few selected
209480	213740	studies that supposedly prove the pundits are right.
213740	219500	They see science, as they always do, as a battle between teams, or political sides.
219500	224900	And that meant anyone who said hydroxychloroquine was not safe and effective for COVID-19 must
224900	227460	be on the opposite team.
227460	232860	Never mind about randomized control trials and meta-analysis and statistically significant
232860	235780	mortality and all that sciencey stuff.
235780	240780	In the end, this is a lot easier to understand than this.
240780	243460	So when Alan Jones asked the question…
243460	245920	Is this because Donald Trump has spoken in favour of it, do you reckon?
245920	250820	He didn't turn to a knowledgeable researcher who could explain all this research to him.
250820	255840	He asked someone on his team, a member of the Australian Parliament with no scientific
255840	257880	expertise at all.
257880	263240	It's ironic that the people who claim that politics is interfering with scientific decisions
263240	269240	are the ones who consistently ignore the conclusions of qualified scientific researchers in favour
269240	273240	of seeking out answers from politicians.
273240	277840	So that brings us on to the next, very reasonable argument.
277840	281960	Hydroxychloroquine may not help, but surely it won't hurt.
281960	286260	After all, there's anecdotal evidence, so why not give it anyway?
286260	291920	That was the view of many people who responded to my video Coronavirus vs Politics.
291920	294720	Sure, no need to convince me.
294720	300320	Of course it's been around for a long time to treat malaria, lupus and rheumatoid arthritis.
300320	305920	But Covid-19 treatment with hydroxychloroquine is a safe and generic medication?
305920	314880	Yes, for treating malaria, lupus and rheumatoid arthritis, not for treating Covid-19.
314880	318540	There are many studies of hydroxychloroquine's effects and they are all in agreement that
318540	321560	if it's taken in the right doses, it's safe.
321560	326480	There is no reason to believe why somebody having the coronavirus would change this fact.
326800	333800	Actually, there is a reason to believe that if the coronavirus manifests itself as Covid-19.
333800	337800	The next poster inadvertently stumbled on the answer.
337800	342400	The safety and side effects of chloroquine are well understood and the mechanism of action
342400	344320	is well understood.
344320	350560	Indeed, the side effects of chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine are well understood and
350560	354280	that's why it's a problem for Covid-19 patients.
354280	359520	To find out why, first I have to explain something called the QT interval.
359520	363700	It's the period of time between the end of the heart's atrial contraction and the end
363700	368760	of its ventricular contraction, this part of the heart's cycle.
368760	374940	The interval, shown here by the peaks labelled Q and T, is called the QT interval.
374940	377960	In a normal heart it looks like this.
377960	382560	But medical researchers have known for a long time that hydroxychloroquine has an adverse
382560	387280	effect on the heart's rhythm by lengthening the QT interval.
387280	391920	This has been the subject of discussion and published research long before SARS-CoV-2
391920	393440	came along.
393440	398520	But unless a patient has existing heart problems, and most patients with malaria, lupus and
398520	405280	rheumatoid arthritis don't, then the adverse effects are outweighed by the benefits.
405280	410760	The problem is, a lot of Covid patients do often have heart problems is one of the complications
410760	412860	of Covid-19.
412860	417340	So pretty early on, several studies focused on whether this might be aggravated by the
417340	420280	use of hydroxychloroquine.
420280	423880	Some studies found it did, some found that it didn't.
423880	428380	Some even found a statistically significant increase in the number of deaths.
428380	434440	So no, the studies are not in agreement that hydroxychloroquine is safe for Covid-19, even
434440	437040	in the right doses.
437040	441520	In case you think there's something political about the QT cycle, I should point out that
441520	447540	hydroxychloroquine upsets the cardiac cycle whether you're a Republican or a Democrat.
447540	449520	But try telling that to members of the team.
449520	450520	There was a lot of fear.
450520	455580	I mean, obviously there was strange political reasons that I'll never understand.
455580	458680	When I recommend something, they like to say don't use it.
458680	462960	OK, well there's one last piece of the puzzle that shows this has nothing to do with party
462960	463960	politics.
463960	471360	We want the FDA to issue an emergency use authorization for Remdesivir.
471360	475520	We would like to see very quick approvals, especially with things at work.
475520	479880	And Remdesivir has been approved by health authorities all over the world, including
479880	481620	the United States.
481620	484040	It's widely used as a therapy.
484040	486460	The president also endorsed this treatment.
486460	489360	Within a very short period of time, they gave me Regeneron.
489360	494560	And Regeneron has been approved for emergency use in treating Covid-19, and that authorization
494560	498120	is being expanded as trials continue.
498120	500080	And of course, there's the vaccine.
500080	504960	And the vaccine looks like it's really heading in a very rapid direction, a very positive
504960	505960	direction.
505960	509780	No need to tell you that that has been approved and widely adopted.
509780	514080	So the common denominator is not whether the president spoke in favour of a particular
514080	520040	therapy, but whether clinical trials showed that the medication was effective and reasonably
520040	521160	safe.
521160	526920	As so often happens, eventually the pundits have no choice but to catch up with the science.
526920	533300	So after 18 months of bombshell reports that prove hydroxychloroquine works, most opinion
533300	536580	makers have now quietly stopped promoting it.
536580	540760	So it's not the researchers who are eating their word, but the amateurs who play doctor
540760	542420	on TV.
542420	547900	At least it would be if they could bring themselves to issue a correction or an apology.
547900	549680	But of course, there hasn't been any.
549680	552460	The promotion has just been quietly dropped.
552460	558320	Sky News, which once cried censorship and cancel culture when YouTube removed its misleading
558320	564960	videos on hydroxychloroquine, ended up removing the videos itself from its own website, including
564960	566140	this one.
566140	571000	It just takes these people a little longer to catch up with the rest of us.
571000	576660	Now another drug, ivermectin, is being touted as the latest miracle cure that the authorities
576660	578760	don't want you to know about.
578760	583960	A lot of studies have been done on ivermectin, and as always it's the positive ones that
583960	586560	are selected and promoted.
586560	590140	But the quality of some of these studies is questionable.
590140	595160	Many of the amateurs supported their case for ivermectin by citing a preprint, in other
595160	600020	words a study that hadn't been peer reviewed that was later found to be fraudulent and
600060	602600	withdrawn from publication.
602600	605220	That's bad enough, but it gets worse.
605220	610300	That study was so large that it became an important component of meta-analyses also
610300	615740	touted by amateur pundits, as proof that ivermectin works.
615740	622140	Another study touted by the gurus seemed too good to be true – a 100% success rate.
622140	624720	The lead author was Hector Cavallo.
624720	628780	But medical professionals and journalists have found a number of discrepancies in the
628780	629780	study.
629780	633980	There were contradictions in the number of participants given in the paper and submitted
633980	637260	to an official clinical trials database.
637260	639180	Some of the numbers don't even add up.
639180	644220	I mean literally they don't equal the totals at the bottom of the table.
644220	649000	A hospital named in the paper announced that it had no record of the study and its name
649000	651420	had to be removed from the paper.
651420	657140	It was replaced with a vague reference to Other Peripheral Medical Centre, which remains
657140	658140	unnamed.
658180	663060	A doctor, whom the lead author said had helped review the data, denied having anything to
663060	665160	do with the study.
665160	668140	Why wasn't any of this picked up in peer review?
668140	672900	Perhaps because this study was published in an open access journal that isn't on the
672900	677860	master journals list, in other words little better than a website, and there were only
677860	681780	seven days between submission and acceptance.
681780	686680	I have to point out that the case of ivermectin is not yet a carbon copy of what happened
686720	688520	with hydroxychloroquine.
688520	694400	I can't proclaim that ivermectin works or doesn't work as a treatment or a prophylaxis.
694400	696160	What's wrong with me?
696160	698380	Why can't I pick a team?
698380	701040	Because that's not how science works.
701040	706600	The efficacy of ivermectin is dependent on evidence and professional medical bodies,
706600	710800	including the company that discovered and markets the drug, have determined that the
710800	713400	evidence is still lacking.
713400	718880	They say studies done so far have been small-scale, inadequate and contradictory.
718880	724720	What's needed is a proper large-scale, randomised control trial, and this is now being undertaken
724720	727400	by Oxford University.
727400	732340	But it's unfortunate that such tentative data are being used to not only promote ivermectin
732340	737720	on mainstream and social media, but to proclaim that if it's as effective as its proponents
737720	744840	hope, and they're often preaching that hope as a fact, then it makes the vaccine unnecessary.
744840	751240	And that has real-life consequences for people who take these pronouncements on faith.
751240	756360	But this video isn't about ivermectin, and it isn't even about hydroxychloroquine.
756360	762680	It's about how science has been co-opted by the self-professed gurus who make these recommendations
762680	765680	and the blind faith of people who believe them.
765680	771240	The crucial question on these miracle drugs isn't a political one, but a medical one.
771240	776140	Should health experts authorise a drug that they know could cause patients to die and
776140	782960	is most likely ineffective when other therapies that are effective are readily available?
782960	788000	Imagine if they had authorised hydroxychloroquine, despite knowing that studies showed it was
788000	791240	ineffective and a danger to patients.
791240	795580	Now that would be a real conspiracy, and I wonder who would be the first to express
795580	797400	outrage at that.
797400	798880	Careful what you wish for, Laura.
821240	823240	Thank you.
