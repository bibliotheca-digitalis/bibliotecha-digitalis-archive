1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,980
Contrary to the media narrative, COVID-19 treatment with hydroxychloroquine is a safe

2
00:00:05,980 --> 00:00:06,980
and generic...

3
00:00:06,980 --> 00:00:10,860
Whoa, before people start reaching for the fish tank cleaner and YouTube blocks this

4
00:00:10,860 --> 00:00:15,120
video, let me jump in quickly and say that this is crap.

5
00:00:15,120 --> 00:00:19,760
So don't take medical advice from television pundits on Sky News.

6
00:00:19,760 --> 00:00:23,840
I'm going to look at the rise and fall of a therapy that was passionately championed

7
00:00:23,840 --> 00:00:29,120
in some sections of the media and the dangers of mixing politics and medicine.

8
00:00:29,240 --> 00:00:34,120
I'm going to look at the scientific reasons why hydroxychloroquine hasn't been approved

9
00:00:34,120 --> 00:00:40,800
by the FDA, the Therapeutics Goods Administration of Australia, the PFSB of Japan, and just

10
00:00:40,800 --> 00:00:46,120
about every major pharmaceutical authority in Europe except, I think, for Italy.

11
00:00:46,120 --> 00:00:48,720
Is this because Donald Trump has spoken in favour of it, do you reckon?

12
00:00:48,720 --> 00:00:54,160
No, Alan, it's because nearly every study that's been done shows that hydroxychloroquine

13
00:00:54,160 --> 00:00:56,480
isn't an effective treatment.

14
00:00:56,480 --> 00:01:00,840
That may be hard to fathom if you ignore most of the science and only have a flawed,

15
00:01:00,840 --> 00:01:03,440
narrow and selective understanding of the research.

16
00:01:03,440 --> 00:01:08,620
In a new study, Smith and three other medical experts prove what he and his This Show have

17
00:01:08,620 --> 00:01:13,540
been telling you for more than a year, that hydroxychloroquine can save lives.

18
00:01:13,540 --> 00:01:18,040
But this wasn't a published clinical study or a randomized trial.

19
00:01:18,040 --> 00:01:23,600
It was an observational study made by a group of doctors that was posted online.

20
00:01:23,600 --> 00:01:28,480
There certainly have been a few studies that found hydroxychloroquine might be beneficial,

21
00:01:28,480 --> 00:01:33,200
like this study by Achad et al. published in May 2020.

22
00:01:33,200 --> 00:01:37,200
But for all the hype it was given in some sections of the media, you wouldn't know that

23
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:41,600
it was not a randomized control study and that it had a caveat.

24
00:01:41,600 --> 00:01:47,840
Well, a new hydroxychloroquine study has just dropped and it could have all those experts

25
00:01:47,840 --> 00:01:48,840
eating their words.

26
00:01:48,840 --> 00:01:55,360
The Henry Ford Health System in Michigan tonight is announcing that hydroxychloroquine significantly

27
00:01:55,360 --> 00:02:00,680
reduced death rates among sick and hospitalized COVID patients.

28
00:02:00,680 --> 00:02:03,240
No, it didn't say that at all.

29
00:02:03,240 --> 00:02:08,940
What it actually concluded was that treatment with hydroxychloroquine alone and in combination

30
00:02:08,940 --> 00:02:15,620
with azithromycin was associated with a reduction in COVID-19-associated mortality.

31
00:02:15,620 --> 00:02:19,120
An association is not the same as cause and effect.

32
00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:22,860
For that, the study recommends prospective trials.

33
00:02:22,860 --> 00:02:24,660
And these were done.

34
00:02:24,660 --> 00:02:29,740
When taken in their totality, rather than picking just one or two for a TV program,

35
00:02:29,740 --> 00:02:33,800
they show that hydroxychloroquine is ineffective.

36
00:02:33,800 --> 00:02:40,540
This review found no benefit on viral clearance but a significant increase in mortality.

37
00:02:40,540 --> 00:02:45,060
All these studies can be found in the review linked in the video description, as are my

38
00:02:45,060 --> 00:02:49,900
other sources, so you can check all these studies yourselves.

39
00:02:49,900 --> 00:02:56,880
And this review of studies looking at hydroxychloroquine as a prophylaxis also found that it was ineffective.

40
00:02:56,880 --> 00:03:01,820
The key message from completed studies and randomized control trials seems to be that

41
00:03:01,820 --> 00:03:05,520
hydroxychloroquine does not work.

42
00:03:05,520 --> 00:03:10,460
An editorial in the Journal of the American Medical Association also summarized the findings

43
00:03:10,460 --> 00:03:12,720
of all the studies.

44
00:03:12,720 --> 00:03:18,280
These well-conducted trials, it said, including the study reported in this issue of JAMA,

45
00:03:18,280 --> 00:03:24,680
demonstrate the lack of efficacy of hydroxychloroquine in patients with COVID-19.

46
00:03:24,680 --> 00:03:29,480
They have been ignored by many TV pundits in favour of trumpeting just a few selected

47
00:03:29,480 --> 00:03:33,740
studies that supposedly prove the pundits are right.

48
00:03:33,740 --> 00:03:39,500
They see science, as they always do, as a battle between teams, or political sides.

49
00:03:39,500 --> 00:03:44,900
And that meant anyone who said hydroxychloroquine was not safe and effective for COVID-19 must

50
00:03:44,900 --> 00:03:47,460
be on the opposite team.

51
00:03:47,460 --> 00:03:52,860
Never mind about randomized control trials and meta-analysis and statistically significant

52
00:03:52,860 --> 00:03:55,780
mortality and all that sciencey stuff.

53
00:03:55,780 --> 00:04:00,780
In the end, this is a lot easier to understand than this.

54
00:04:00,780 --> 00:04:03,460
So when Alan Jones asked the questionâ€¦

55
00:04:03,460 --> 00:04:05,920
Is this because Donald Trump has spoken in favour of it, do you reckon?

56
00:04:05,920 --> 00:04:10,820
He didn't turn to a knowledgeable researcher who could explain all this research to him.

57
00:04:10,820 --> 00:04:15,840
He asked someone on his team, a member of the Australian Parliament with no scientific

58
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:17,880
expertise at all.

59
00:04:17,880 --> 00:04:23,240
It's ironic that the people who claim that politics is interfering with scientific decisions

60
00:04:23,240 --> 00:04:29,240
are the ones who consistently ignore the conclusions of qualified scientific researchers in favour

61
00:04:29,240 --> 00:04:33,240
of seeking out answers from politicians.

62
00:04:33,240 --> 00:04:37,840
So that brings us on to the next, very reasonable argument.

63
00:04:37,840 --> 00:04:41,960
Hydroxychloroquine may not help, but surely it won't hurt.

64
00:04:41,960 --> 00:04:46,260
After all, there's anecdotal evidence, so why not give it anyway?

65
00:04:46,260 --> 00:04:51,920
That was the view of many people who responded to my video Coronavirus vs Politics.

66
00:04:51,920 --> 00:04:54,720
Sure, no need to convince me.

67
00:04:54,720 --> 00:05:00,320
Of course it's been around for a long time to treat malaria, lupus and rheumatoid arthritis.

68
00:05:00,320 --> 00:05:05,920
But Covid-19 treatment with hydroxychloroquine is a safe and generic medication?

69
00:05:05,920 --> 00:05:14,880
Yes, for treating malaria, lupus and rheumatoid arthritis, not for treating Covid-19.

70
00:05:14,880 --> 00:05:18,540
There are many studies of hydroxychloroquine's effects and they are all in agreement that

71
00:05:18,540 --> 00:05:21,560
if it's taken in the right doses, it's safe.

72
00:05:21,560 --> 00:05:26,480
There is no reason to believe why somebody having the coronavirus would change this fact.

73
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:33,800
Actually, there is a reason to believe that if the coronavirus manifests itself as Covid-19.

74
00:05:33,800 --> 00:05:37,800
The next poster inadvertently stumbled on the answer.

75
00:05:37,800 --> 00:05:42,400
The safety and side effects of chloroquine are well understood and the mechanism of action

76
00:05:42,400 --> 00:05:44,320
is well understood.

77
00:05:44,320 --> 00:05:50,560
Indeed, the side effects of chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine are well understood and

78
00:05:50,560 --> 00:05:54,280
that's why it's a problem for Covid-19 patients.

79
00:05:54,280 --> 00:05:59,520
To find out why, first I have to explain something called the QT interval.

80
00:05:59,520 --> 00:06:03,700
It's the period of time between the end of the heart's atrial contraction and the end

81
00:06:03,700 --> 00:06:08,760
of its ventricular contraction, this part of the heart's cycle.

82
00:06:08,760 --> 00:06:14,940
The interval, shown here by the peaks labelled Q and T, is called the QT interval.

83
00:06:14,940 --> 00:06:17,960
In a normal heart it looks like this.

84
00:06:17,960 --> 00:06:22,560
But medical researchers have known for a long time that hydroxychloroquine has an adverse

85
00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:27,280
effect on the heart's rhythm by lengthening the QT interval.

86
00:06:27,280 --> 00:06:31,920
This has been the subject of discussion and published research long before SARS-CoV-2

87
00:06:31,920 --> 00:06:33,440
came along.

88
00:06:33,440 --> 00:06:38,520
But unless a patient has existing heart problems, and most patients with malaria, lupus and

89
00:06:38,520 --> 00:06:45,280
rheumatoid arthritis don't, then the adverse effects are outweighed by the benefits.

90
00:06:45,280 --> 00:06:50,760
The problem is, a lot of Covid patients do often have heart problems is one of the complications

91
00:06:50,760 --> 00:06:52,860
of Covid-19.

92
00:06:52,860 --> 00:06:57,340
So pretty early on, several studies focused on whether this might be aggravated by the

93
00:06:57,340 --> 00:07:00,280
use of hydroxychloroquine.

94
00:07:00,280 --> 00:07:03,880
Some studies found it did, some found that it didn't.

95
00:07:03,880 --> 00:07:08,380
Some even found a statistically significant increase in the number of deaths.

96
00:07:08,380 --> 00:07:14,440
So no, the studies are not in agreement that hydroxychloroquine is safe for Covid-19, even

97
00:07:14,440 --> 00:07:17,040
in the right doses.

98
00:07:17,040 --> 00:07:21,520
In case you think there's something political about the QT cycle, I should point out that

99
00:07:21,520 --> 00:07:27,540
hydroxychloroquine upsets the cardiac cycle whether you're a Republican or a Democrat.

100
00:07:27,540 --> 00:07:29,520
But try telling that to members of the team.

101
00:07:29,520 --> 00:07:30,520
There was a lot of fear.

102
00:07:30,520 --> 00:07:35,580
I mean, obviously there was strange political reasons that I'll never understand.

103
00:07:35,580 --> 00:07:38,680
When I recommend something, they like to say don't use it.

104
00:07:38,680 --> 00:07:42,960
OK, well there's one last piece of the puzzle that shows this has nothing to do with party

105
00:07:42,960 --> 00:07:43,960
politics.

106
00:07:43,960 --> 00:07:51,360
We want the FDA to issue an emergency use authorization for Remdesivir.

107
00:07:51,360 --> 00:07:55,520
We would like to see very quick approvals, especially with things at work.

108
00:07:55,520 --> 00:07:59,880
And Remdesivir has been approved by health authorities all over the world, including

109
00:07:59,880 --> 00:08:01,620
the United States.

110
00:08:01,620 --> 00:08:04,040
It's widely used as a therapy.

111
00:08:04,040 --> 00:08:06,460
The president also endorsed this treatment.

112
00:08:06,460 --> 00:08:09,360
Within a very short period of time, they gave me Regeneron.

113
00:08:09,360 --> 00:08:14,560
And Regeneron has been approved for emergency use in treating Covid-19, and that authorization

114
00:08:14,560 --> 00:08:18,120
is being expanded as trials continue.

115
00:08:18,120 --> 00:08:20,080
And of course, there's the vaccine.

116
00:08:20,080 --> 00:08:24,960
And the vaccine looks like it's really heading in a very rapid direction, a very positive

117
00:08:24,960 --> 00:08:25,960
direction.

118
00:08:25,960 --> 00:08:29,780
No need to tell you that that has been approved and widely adopted.

119
00:08:29,780 --> 00:08:34,080
So the common denominator is not whether the president spoke in favour of a particular

120
00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:40,040
therapy, but whether clinical trials showed that the medication was effective and reasonably

121
00:08:40,040 --> 00:08:41,160
safe.

122
00:08:41,160 --> 00:08:46,920
As so often happens, eventually the pundits have no choice but to catch up with the science.

123
00:08:46,920 --> 00:08:53,300
So after 18 months of bombshell reports that prove hydroxychloroquine works, most opinion

124
00:08:53,300 --> 00:08:56,580
makers have now quietly stopped promoting it.

125
00:08:56,580 --> 00:09:00,760
So it's not the researchers who are eating their word, but the amateurs who play doctor

126
00:09:00,760 --> 00:09:02,420
on TV.

127
00:09:02,420 --> 00:09:07,900
At least it would be if they could bring themselves to issue a correction or an apology.

128
00:09:07,900 --> 00:09:09,680
But of course, there hasn't been any.

129
00:09:09,680 --> 00:09:12,460
The promotion has just been quietly dropped.

130
00:09:12,460 --> 00:09:18,320
Sky News, which once cried censorship and cancel culture when YouTube removed its misleading

131
00:09:18,320 --> 00:09:24,960
videos on hydroxychloroquine, ended up removing the videos itself from its own website, including

132
00:09:24,960 --> 00:09:26,140
this one.

133
00:09:26,140 --> 00:09:31,000
It just takes these people a little longer to catch up with the rest of us.

134
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:36,660
Now another drug, ivermectin, is being touted as the latest miracle cure that the authorities

135
00:09:36,660 --> 00:09:38,760
don't want you to know about.

136
00:09:38,760 --> 00:09:43,960
A lot of studies have been done on ivermectin, and as always it's the positive ones that

137
00:09:43,960 --> 00:09:46,560
are selected and promoted.

138
00:09:46,560 --> 00:09:50,140
But the quality of some of these studies is questionable.

139
00:09:50,140 --> 00:09:55,160
Many of the amateurs supported their case for ivermectin by citing a preprint, in other

140
00:09:55,160 --> 00:10:00,020
words a study that hadn't been peer reviewed that was later found to be fraudulent and

141
00:10:00,060 --> 00:10:02,600
withdrawn from publication.

142
00:10:02,600 --> 00:10:05,220
That's bad enough, but it gets worse.

143
00:10:05,220 --> 00:10:10,300
That study was so large that it became an important component of meta-analyses also

144
00:10:10,300 --> 00:10:15,740
touted by amateur pundits, as proof that ivermectin works.

145
00:10:15,740 --> 00:10:22,140
Another study touted by the gurus seemed too good to be true â€“ a 100% success rate.

146
00:10:22,140 --> 00:10:24,720
The lead author was Hector Cavallo.

147
00:10:24,720 --> 00:10:28,780
But medical professionals and journalists have found a number of discrepancies in the

148
00:10:28,780 --> 00:10:29,780
study.

149
00:10:29,780 --> 00:10:33,980
There were contradictions in the number of participants given in the paper and submitted

150
00:10:33,980 --> 00:10:37,260
to an official clinical trials database.

151
00:10:37,260 --> 00:10:39,180
Some of the numbers don't even add up.

152
00:10:39,180 --> 00:10:44,220
I mean literally they don't equal the totals at the bottom of the table.

153
00:10:44,220 --> 00:10:49,000
A hospital named in the paper announced that it had no record of the study and its name

154
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:51,420
had to be removed from the paper.

155
00:10:51,420 --> 00:10:57,140
It was replaced with a vague reference to Other Peripheral Medical Centre, which remains

156
00:10:57,140 --> 00:10:58,140
unnamed.

157
00:10:58,180 --> 00:11:03,060
A doctor, whom the lead author said had helped review the data, denied having anything to

158
00:11:03,060 --> 00:11:05,160
do with the study.

159
00:11:05,160 --> 00:11:08,140
Why wasn't any of this picked up in peer review?

160
00:11:08,140 --> 00:11:12,900
Perhaps because this study was published in an open access journal that isn't on the

161
00:11:12,900 --> 00:11:17,860
master journals list, in other words little better than a website, and there were only

162
00:11:17,860 --> 00:11:21,780
seven days between submission and acceptance.

163
00:11:21,780 --> 00:11:26,680
I have to point out that the case of ivermectin is not yet a carbon copy of what happened

164
00:11:26,720 --> 00:11:28,520
with hydroxychloroquine.

165
00:11:28,520 --> 00:11:34,400
I can't proclaim that ivermectin works or doesn't work as a treatment or a prophylaxis.

166
00:11:34,400 --> 00:11:36,160
What's wrong with me?

167
00:11:36,160 --> 00:11:38,380
Why can't I pick a team?

168
00:11:38,380 --> 00:11:41,040
Because that's not how science works.

169
00:11:41,040 --> 00:11:46,600
The efficacy of ivermectin is dependent on evidence and professional medical bodies,

170
00:11:46,600 --> 00:11:50,800
including the company that discovered and markets the drug, have determined that the

171
00:11:50,800 --> 00:11:53,400
evidence is still lacking.

172
00:11:53,400 --> 00:11:58,880
They say studies done so far have been small-scale, inadequate and contradictory.

173
00:11:58,880 --> 00:12:04,720
What's needed is a proper large-scale, randomised control trial, and this is now being undertaken

174
00:12:04,720 --> 00:12:07,400
by Oxford University.

175
00:12:07,400 --> 00:12:12,340
But it's unfortunate that such tentative data are being used to not only promote ivermectin

176
00:12:12,340 --> 00:12:17,720
on mainstream and social media, but to proclaim that if it's as effective as its proponents

177
00:12:17,720 --> 00:12:24,840
hope, and they're often preaching that hope as a fact, then it makes the vaccine unnecessary.

178
00:12:24,840 --> 00:12:31,240
And that has real-life consequences for people who take these pronouncements on faith.

179
00:12:31,240 --> 00:12:36,360
But this video isn't about ivermectin, and it isn't even about hydroxychloroquine.

180
00:12:36,360 --> 00:12:42,680
It's about how science has been co-opted by the self-professed gurus who make these recommendations

181
00:12:42,680 --> 00:12:45,680
and the blind faith of people who believe them.

182
00:12:45,680 --> 00:12:51,240
The crucial question on these miracle drugs isn't a political one, but a medical one.

183
00:12:51,240 --> 00:12:56,140
Should health experts authorise a drug that they know could cause patients to die and

184
00:12:56,140 --> 00:13:02,960
is most likely ineffective when other therapies that are effective are readily available?

185
00:13:02,960 --> 00:13:08,000
Imagine if they had authorised hydroxychloroquine, despite knowing that studies showed it was

186
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:11,240
ineffective and a danger to patients.

187
00:13:11,240 --> 00:13:15,580
Now that would be a real conspiracy, and I wonder who would be the first to express

188
00:13:15,580 --> 00:13:17,400
outrage at that.

189
00:13:17,400 --> 00:13:18,880
Careful what you wish for, Laura.

190
00:13:41,240 --> 00:13:43,240
Thank you.
