WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:05.980
Contrary to the media narrative, COVID-19 treatment with hydroxychloroquine is a safe

00:05.980 --> 00:06.980
and generic...

00:06.980 --> 00:10.860
Whoa, before people start reaching for the fish tank cleaner and YouTube blocks this

00:10.860 --> 00:15.120
video, let me jump in quickly and say that this is crap.

00:15.120 --> 00:19.760
So don't take medical advice from television pundits on Sky News.

00:19.760 --> 00:23.840
I'm going to look at the rise and fall of a therapy that was passionately championed

00:23.840 --> 00:29.120
in some sections of the media and the dangers of mixing politics and medicine.

00:29.240 --> 00:34.120
I'm going to look at the scientific reasons why hydroxychloroquine hasn't been approved

00:34.120 --> 00:40.800
by the FDA, the Therapeutics Goods Administration of Australia, the PFSB of Japan, and just

00:40.800 --> 00:46.120
about every major pharmaceutical authority in Europe except, I think, for Italy.

00:46.120 --> 00:48.720
Is this because Donald Trump has spoken in favour of it, do you reckon?

00:48.720 --> 00:54.160
No, Alan, it's because nearly every study that's been done shows that hydroxychloroquine

00:54.160 --> 00:56.480
isn't an effective treatment.

00:56.480 --> 01:00.840
That may be hard to fathom if you ignore most of the science and only have a flawed,

01:00.840 --> 01:03.440
narrow and selective understanding of the research.

01:03.440 --> 01:08.620
In a new study, Smith and three other medical experts prove what he and his This Show have

01:08.620 --> 01:13.540
been telling you for more than a year, that hydroxychloroquine can save lives.

01:13.540 --> 01:18.040
But this wasn't a published clinical study or a randomized trial.

01:18.040 --> 01:23.600
It was an observational study made by a group of doctors that was posted online.

01:23.600 --> 01:28.480
There certainly have been a few studies that found hydroxychloroquine might be beneficial,

01:28.480 --> 01:33.200
like this study by Achad et al. published in May 2020.

01:33.200 --> 01:37.200
But for all the hype it was given in some sections of the media, you wouldn't know that

01:37.200 --> 01:41.600
it was not a randomized control study and that it had a caveat.

01:41.600 --> 01:47.840
Well, a new hydroxychloroquine study has just dropped and it could have all those experts

01:47.840 --> 01:48.840
eating their words.

01:48.840 --> 01:55.360
The Henry Ford Health System in Michigan tonight is announcing that hydroxychloroquine significantly

01:55.360 --> 02:00.680
reduced death rates among sick and hospitalized COVID patients.

02:00.680 --> 02:03.240
No, it didn't say that at all.

02:03.240 --> 02:08.940
What it actually concluded was that treatment with hydroxychloroquine alone and in combination

02:08.940 --> 02:15.620
with azithromycin was associated with a reduction in COVID-19-associated mortality.

02:15.620 --> 02:19.120
An association is not the same as cause and effect.

02:19.120 --> 02:22.860
For that, the study recommends prospective trials.

02:22.860 --> 02:24.660
And these were done.

02:24.660 --> 02:29.740
When taken in their totality, rather than picking just one or two for a TV program,

02:29.740 --> 02:33.800
they show that hydroxychloroquine is ineffective.

02:33.800 --> 02:40.540
This review found no benefit on viral clearance but a significant increase in mortality.

02:40.540 --> 02:45.060
All these studies can be found in the review linked in the video description, as are my

02:45.060 --> 02:49.900
other sources, so you can check all these studies yourselves.

02:49.900 --> 02:56.880
And this review of studies looking at hydroxychloroquine as a prophylaxis also found that it was ineffective.

02:56.880 --> 03:01.820
The key message from completed studies and randomized control trials seems to be that

03:01.820 --> 03:05.520
hydroxychloroquine does not work.

03:05.520 --> 03:10.460
An editorial in the Journal of the American Medical Association also summarized the findings

03:10.460 --> 03:12.720
of all the studies.

03:12.720 --> 03:18.280
These well-conducted trials, it said, including the study reported in this issue of JAMA,

03:18.280 --> 03:24.680
demonstrate the lack of efficacy of hydroxychloroquine in patients with COVID-19.

03:24.680 --> 03:29.480
They have been ignored by many TV pundits in favour of trumpeting just a few selected

03:29.480 --> 03:33.740
studies that supposedly prove the pundits are right.

03:33.740 --> 03:39.500
They see science, as they always do, as a battle between teams, or political sides.

03:39.500 --> 03:44.900
And that meant anyone who said hydroxychloroquine was not safe and effective for COVID-19 must

03:44.900 --> 03:47.460
be on the opposite team.

03:47.460 --> 03:52.860
Never mind about randomized control trials and meta-analysis and statistically significant

03:52.860 --> 03:55.780
mortality and all that sciencey stuff.

03:55.780 --> 04:00.780
In the end, this is a lot easier to understand than this.

04:00.780 --> 04:03.460
So when Alan Jones asked the question…

04:03.460 --> 04:05.920
Is this because Donald Trump has spoken in favour of it, do you reckon?

04:05.920 --> 04:10.820
He didn't turn to a knowledgeable researcher who could explain all this research to him.

04:10.820 --> 04:15.840
He asked someone on his team, a member of the Australian Parliament with no scientific

04:15.840 --> 04:17.880
expertise at all.

04:17.880 --> 04:23.240
It's ironic that the people who claim that politics is interfering with scientific decisions

04:23.240 --> 04:29.240
are the ones who consistently ignore the conclusions of qualified scientific researchers in favour

04:29.240 --> 04:33.240
of seeking out answers from politicians.

04:33.240 --> 04:37.840
So that brings us on to the next, very reasonable argument.

04:37.840 --> 04:41.960
Hydroxychloroquine may not help, but surely it won't hurt.

04:41.960 --> 04:46.260
After all, there's anecdotal evidence, so why not give it anyway?

04:46.260 --> 04:51.920
That was the view of many people who responded to my video Coronavirus vs Politics.

04:51.920 --> 04:54.720
Sure, no need to convince me.

04:54.720 --> 05:00.320
Of course it's been around for a long time to treat malaria, lupus and rheumatoid arthritis.

05:00.320 --> 05:05.920
But Covid-19 treatment with hydroxychloroquine is a safe and generic medication?

05:05.920 --> 05:14.880
Yes, for treating malaria, lupus and rheumatoid arthritis, not for treating Covid-19.

05:14.880 --> 05:18.540
There are many studies of hydroxychloroquine's effects and they are all in agreement that

05:18.540 --> 05:21.560
if it's taken in the right doses, it's safe.

05:21.560 --> 05:26.480
There is no reason to believe why somebody having the coronavirus would change this fact.

05:26.800 --> 05:33.800
Actually, there is a reason to believe that if the coronavirus manifests itself as Covid-19.

05:33.800 --> 05:37.800
The next poster inadvertently stumbled on the answer.

05:37.800 --> 05:42.400
The safety and side effects of chloroquine are well understood and the mechanism of action

05:42.400 --> 05:44.320
is well understood.

05:44.320 --> 05:50.560
Indeed, the side effects of chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine are well understood and

05:50.560 --> 05:54.280
that's why it's a problem for Covid-19 patients.

05:54.280 --> 05:59.520
To find out why, first I have to explain something called the QT interval.

05:59.520 --> 06:03.700
It's the period of time between the end of the heart's atrial contraction and the end

06:03.700 --> 06:08.760
of its ventricular contraction, this part of the heart's cycle.

06:08.760 --> 06:14.940
The interval, shown here by the peaks labelled Q and T, is called the QT interval.

06:14.940 --> 06:17.960
In a normal heart it looks like this.

06:17.960 --> 06:22.560
But medical researchers have known for a long time that hydroxychloroquine has an adverse

06:22.560 --> 06:27.280
effect on the heart's rhythm by lengthening the QT interval.

06:27.280 --> 06:31.920
This has been the subject of discussion and published research long before SARS-CoV-2

06:31.920 --> 06:33.440
came along.

06:33.440 --> 06:38.520
But unless a patient has existing heart problems, and most patients with malaria, lupus and

06:38.520 --> 06:45.280
rheumatoid arthritis don't, then the adverse effects are outweighed by the benefits.

06:45.280 --> 06:50.760
The problem is, a lot of Covid patients do often have heart problems is one of the complications

06:50.760 --> 06:52.860
of Covid-19.

06:52.860 --> 06:57.340
So pretty early on, several studies focused on whether this might be aggravated by the

06:57.340 --> 07:00.280
use of hydroxychloroquine.

07:00.280 --> 07:03.880
Some studies found it did, some found that it didn't.

07:03.880 --> 07:08.380
Some even found a statistically significant increase in the number of deaths.

07:08.380 --> 07:14.440
So no, the studies are not in agreement that hydroxychloroquine is safe for Covid-19, even

07:14.440 --> 07:17.040
in the right doses.

07:17.040 --> 07:21.520
In case you think there's something political about the QT cycle, I should point out that

07:21.520 --> 07:27.540
hydroxychloroquine upsets the cardiac cycle whether you're a Republican or a Democrat.

07:27.540 --> 07:29.520
But try telling that to members of the team.

07:29.520 --> 07:30.520
There was a lot of fear.

07:30.520 --> 07:35.580
I mean, obviously there was strange political reasons that I'll never understand.

07:35.580 --> 07:38.680
When I recommend something, they like to say don't use it.

07:38.680 --> 07:42.960
OK, well there's one last piece of the puzzle that shows this has nothing to do with party

07:42.960 --> 07:43.960
politics.

07:43.960 --> 07:51.360
We want the FDA to issue an emergency use authorization for Remdesivir.

07:51.360 --> 07:55.520
We would like to see very quick approvals, especially with things at work.

07:55.520 --> 07:59.880
And Remdesivir has been approved by health authorities all over the world, including

07:59.880 --> 08:01.620
the United States.

08:01.620 --> 08:04.040
It's widely used as a therapy.

08:04.040 --> 08:06.460
The president also endorsed this treatment.

08:06.460 --> 08:09.360
Within a very short period of time, they gave me Regeneron.

08:09.360 --> 08:14.560
And Regeneron has been approved for emergency use in treating Covid-19, and that authorization

08:14.560 --> 08:18.120
is being expanded as trials continue.

08:18.120 --> 08:20.080
And of course, there's the vaccine.

08:20.080 --> 08:24.960
And the vaccine looks like it's really heading in a very rapid direction, a very positive

08:24.960 --> 08:25.960
direction.

08:25.960 --> 08:29.780
No need to tell you that that has been approved and widely adopted.

08:29.780 --> 08:34.080
So the common denominator is not whether the president spoke in favour of a particular

08:34.080 --> 08:40.040
therapy, but whether clinical trials showed that the medication was effective and reasonably

08:40.040 --> 08:41.160
safe.

08:41.160 --> 08:46.920
As so often happens, eventually the pundits have no choice but to catch up with the science.

08:46.920 --> 08:53.300
So after 18 months of bombshell reports that prove hydroxychloroquine works, most opinion

08:53.300 --> 08:56.580
makers have now quietly stopped promoting it.

08:56.580 --> 09:00.760
So it's not the researchers who are eating their word, but the amateurs who play doctor

09:00.760 --> 09:02.420
on TV.

09:02.420 --> 09:07.900
At least it would be if they could bring themselves to issue a correction or an apology.

09:07.900 --> 09:09.680
But of course, there hasn't been any.

09:09.680 --> 09:12.460
The promotion has just been quietly dropped.

09:12.460 --> 09:18.320
Sky News, which once cried censorship and cancel culture when YouTube removed its misleading

09:18.320 --> 09:24.960
videos on hydroxychloroquine, ended up removing the videos itself from its own website, including

09:24.960 --> 09:26.140
this one.

09:26.140 --> 09:31.000
It just takes these people a little longer to catch up with the rest of us.

09:31.000 --> 09:36.660
Now another drug, ivermectin, is being touted as the latest miracle cure that the authorities

09:36.660 --> 09:38.760
don't want you to know about.

09:38.760 --> 09:43.960
A lot of studies have been done on ivermectin, and as always it's the positive ones that

09:43.960 --> 09:46.560
are selected and promoted.

09:46.560 --> 09:50.140
But the quality of some of these studies is questionable.

09:50.140 --> 09:55.160
Many of the amateurs supported their case for ivermectin by citing a preprint, in other

09:55.160 --> 10:00.020
words a study that hadn't been peer reviewed that was later found to be fraudulent and

10:00.060 --> 10:02.600
withdrawn from publication.

10:02.600 --> 10:05.220
That's bad enough, but it gets worse.

10:05.220 --> 10:10.300
That study was so large that it became an important component of meta-analyses also

10:10.300 --> 10:15.740
touted by amateur pundits, as proof that ivermectin works.

10:15.740 --> 10:22.140
Another study touted by the gurus seemed too good to be true – a 100% success rate.

10:22.140 --> 10:24.720
The lead author was Hector Cavallo.

10:24.720 --> 10:28.780
But medical professionals and journalists have found a number of discrepancies in the

10:28.780 --> 10:29.780
study.

10:29.780 --> 10:33.980
There were contradictions in the number of participants given in the paper and submitted

10:33.980 --> 10:37.260
to an official clinical trials database.

10:37.260 --> 10:39.180
Some of the numbers don't even add up.

10:39.180 --> 10:44.220
I mean literally they don't equal the totals at the bottom of the table.

10:44.220 --> 10:49.000
A hospital named in the paper announced that it had no record of the study and its name

10:49.000 --> 10:51.420
had to be removed from the paper.

10:51.420 --> 10:57.140
It was replaced with a vague reference to Other Peripheral Medical Centre, which remains

10:57.140 --> 10:58.140
unnamed.

10:58.180 --> 11:03.060
A doctor, whom the lead author said had helped review the data, denied having anything to

11:03.060 --> 11:05.160
do with the study.

11:05.160 --> 11:08.140
Why wasn't any of this picked up in peer review?

11:08.140 --> 11:12.900
Perhaps because this study was published in an open access journal that isn't on the

11:12.900 --> 11:17.860
master journals list, in other words little better than a website, and there were only

11:17.860 --> 11:21.780
seven days between submission and acceptance.

11:21.780 --> 11:26.680
I have to point out that the case of ivermectin is not yet a carbon copy of what happened

11:26.720 --> 11:28.520
with hydroxychloroquine.

11:28.520 --> 11:34.400
I can't proclaim that ivermectin works or doesn't work as a treatment or a prophylaxis.

11:34.400 --> 11:36.160
What's wrong with me?

11:36.160 --> 11:38.380
Why can't I pick a team?

11:38.380 --> 11:41.040
Because that's not how science works.

11:41.040 --> 11:46.600
The efficacy of ivermectin is dependent on evidence and professional medical bodies,

11:46.600 --> 11:50.800
including the company that discovered and markets the drug, have determined that the

11:50.800 --> 11:53.400
evidence is still lacking.

11:53.400 --> 11:58.880
They say studies done so far have been small-scale, inadequate and contradictory.

11:58.880 --> 12:04.720
What's needed is a proper large-scale, randomised control trial, and this is now being undertaken

12:04.720 --> 12:07.400
by Oxford University.

12:07.400 --> 12:12.340
But it's unfortunate that such tentative data are being used to not only promote ivermectin

12:12.340 --> 12:17.720
on mainstream and social media, but to proclaim that if it's as effective as its proponents

12:17.720 --> 12:24.840
hope, and they're often preaching that hope as a fact, then it makes the vaccine unnecessary.

12:24.840 --> 12:31.240
And that has real-life consequences for people who take these pronouncements on faith.

12:31.240 --> 12:36.360
But this video isn't about ivermectin, and it isn't even about hydroxychloroquine.

12:36.360 --> 12:42.680
It's about how science has been co-opted by the self-professed gurus who make these recommendations

12:42.680 --> 12:45.680
and the blind faith of people who believe them.

12:45.680 --> 12:51.240
The crucial question on these miracle drugs isn't a political one, but a medical one.

12:51.240 --> 12:56.140
Should health experts authorise a drug that they know could cause patients to die and

12:56.140 --> 13:02.960
is most likely ineffective when other therapies that are effective are readily available?

13:02.960 --> 13:08.000
Imagine if they had authorised hydroxychloroquine, despite knowing that studies showed it was

13:08.000 --> 13:11.240
ineffective and a danger to patients.

13:11.240 --> 13:15.580
Now that would be a real conspiracy, and I wonder who would be the first to express

13:15.580 --> 13:17.400
outrage at that.

13:17.400 --> 13:18.880
Careful what you wish for, Laura.

13:41.240 --> 13:43.240
Thank you.
