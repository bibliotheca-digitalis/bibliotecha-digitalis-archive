1
00:00:00,800 --> 00:00:04,880
I have to add an addendum to my last video, because no sooner had it come out

2
00:00:04,880 --> 00:00:09,120
than the perfect example of what I was saying was splashed all over the internet.

3
00:00:09,120 --> 00:00:14,160
It was a headline that read, there has been no global warming since 1995,

4
00:00:14,160 --> 00:00:18,080
and I'm sure you've all seen it. The source for most of these stories,

5
00:00:18,080 --> 00:00:22,720
and even the headline, was an article in Britain's Daily Mail on February the 14th.

6
00:00:22,720 --> 00:00:24,720
But remember what I said in my last video?

7
00:00:25,440 --> 00:00:29,280
Find out where the information comes from. Is the source reliable?

8
00:00:29,280 --> 00:00:33,840
Does the information you've been given accurately reflect the information from the source?

9
00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:38,640
So instead of trusting the Daily Mail to accurately report what Phil Jones said,

10
00:00:38,640 --> 00:00:44,000
why don't we go to the BBC website and read the transcript and find out what he actually said.

11
00:00:44,720 --> 00:00:46,960
The headline in the Daily Mail was this,

12
00:00:46,960 --> 00:00:53,440
Climategate U-turn as scientist at Centre of Rau admits there has been no global warming since 1995.

13
00:00:53,440 --> 00:00:57,200
But that's not what Phil Jones said. If we go to the source,

14
00:00:57,200 --> 00:01:02,080
the BBC transcript, we find this. Phil Jones was asked if he agreed that from

15
00:01:02,080 --> 00:01:07,200
1995 to the present there's been no statistically significant global warming.

16
00:01:07,760 --> 00:01:14,640
Yes, he said, but only just. I also calculated the trend for the period 1995 to 2009.

17
00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:22,080
This trend, 0.12 degrees centigrade per decade, is positive, but not significant at the 95%

18
00:01:22,080 --> 00:01:26,320
significance level. The positive trend is quite close to the significance level.

19
00:01:26,880 --> 00:01:31,840
This is not the same as saying there's been no warming. Firstly, the word significant in

20
00:01:31,840 --> 00:01:37,040
statistics doesn't indicate how much or how important something is, but how more likely

21
00:01:37,040 --> 00:01:41,840
it is to have occurred by chance. It's a function of the strength of the thing you're measuring,

22
00:01:41,840 --> 00:01:45,040
the strength of the background noise, and the size of the sample.

23
00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:50,800
Phil Jones and his team could measure global warming, he even gave the BBC the figure.

24
00:01:50,800 --> 00:01:55,200
But they couldn't be absolutely sure that this trend was real and not just a chance

25
00:01:55,200 --> 00:02:00,160
anomaly caused by background variations in temperature. Most researchers aim for

26
00:02:00,160 --> 00:02:07,440
a significance level of 95%, meaning they've got 95% confidence that a trend is real and not chance.

27
00:02:08,400 --> 00:02:12,320
Jones said he got close to that. I don't know what figure he reached,

28
00:02:12,320 --> 00:02:18,320
but just for an example, let's say it was 80%. That would mean there's an 80% probability that

29
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:25,360
the warming he detected between 1995 and 2009 was an underlying trend and not a chance result

30
00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:30,080
caused by natural background temperature fluctuations. Of course, the greater your

31
00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:34,960
sample size or the longer you measure something, the more significant your results become.

32
00:02:35,600 --> 00:02:40,800
Let's go to the beach for an example. It's a bit like measuring waves coming onto the shore.

33
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:46,000
If you mark how far each wave comes up the sand with a flag, can you tell whether the tide's

34
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:51,840
coming in? Over a short period of time, say half an hour, your flags might progress very slightly

35
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:56,960
up the beach, which would indicate that the tide's coming in, but the distance is so small

36
00:02:56,960 --> 00:03:02,080
that it's possible it's been distorted by one or two strong waves. To use the Daily Mail's

37
00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:06,640
understanding, this means there's been no movement up the sand for half an hour, so the tide can't

38
00:03:06,640 --> 00:03:12,800
be coming in. But it doesn't. It means there has been movement up the sand, but it's not enough

39
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:17,360
and the time scale is too short to say with confidence that the tide is coming in.

40
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:22,320
OK, one more example and then I'll shut up about statistical significance.

41
00:03:22,960 --> 00:03:27,680
God, I hate statistics. Let's say you're suspicious that a die has been weighted in

42
00:03:27,680 --> 00:03:33,120
favour of falling on a six. If you roll the die a couple of times and it comes up with sixes both

43
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:38,800
times, can you say with confidence that it's been weighted? No, because you could have got

44
00:03:38,800 --> 00:03:43,920
those two sixes through pure chance. So you keep rolling and here's what you get.

45
00:03:44,480 --> 00:03:51,840
A six, a five, a six, a six, a four and two more sixes. How confident are you now?

46
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:57,280
Well, it's beginning to look as though the results are because of weighting rather than chance.

47
00:03:57,280 --> 00:04:02,720
The significance of our results is rising, but it still could be chance. If we're almost at

48
00:04:02,720 --> 00:04:08,560
the 95% significance level but not quite there, what would the Daily Mail make of these results?

49
00:04:09,280 --> 00:04:13,920
They'd say that since the figure isn't significant it means the die isn't weighted.

50
00:04:14,800 --> 00:04:19,440
OK, it's complicated but this is why science is published in scientific journals,

51
00:04:19,440 --> 00:04:24,400
not in the tabloid press. The Daily Mail did get the quote right in the body of the story

52
00:04:24,400 --> 00:04:29,360
but didn't explain what it meant, so readers were left with the impression from the headline

53
00:04:29,360 --> 00:04:35,120
that it meant there's been no warming. So why did Jones go on to say in the BBC interview

54
00:04:35,120 --> 00:04:41,040
he was 100% confident that the climate has warmed? Well, I can't speak for him and I don't

55
00:04:41,040 --> 00:04:47,520
think any scientist can express 100% confidence in anything. But what he was probably referring to

56
00:04:47,520 --> 00:04:53,760
was that the CRU, together with the Hadley Centre, has more than just 15 years of data to draw on.

57
00:04:53,760 --> 00:04:59,200
Let's go back to the analogy. If we keep planting flags over a longer period of time,

58
00:04:59,200 --> 00:05:04,400
say an hour, the movement of flags up the beach overcomes the background noise of advancing and

59
00:05:04,400 --> 00:05:10,080
retreating waves and it becomes very clear that the tide is coming in. So Jones is looking at

60
00:05:10,080 --> 00:05:15,920
over 30 years of data which shows the warming trend very clearly. Not surprisingly, the Daily

61
00:05:15,920 --> 00:05:21,440
Mail completely omitted Jones's statement that the earth was warming. If we look at data from

62
00:05:21,440 --> 00:05:27,120
the other surface temperature monitoring bodies, the GISS and NOAA, the warming trend comes through

63
00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:32,560
more clearly so the statistical significance is higher. This is because there are few weather

64
00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:38,400
stations in the Arctic or Antarctic so Hadcrut, that's the CRU and the Hadley Centre's combined

65
00:05:38,400 --> 00:05:44,800
data, leaves these areas out. Goddard and NOAA extrapolate Arctic and Antarctic temperatures

66
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:50,320
from the nearest available weather stations, so their coverage is more extensive. Since the

67
00:05:50,320 --> 00:05:55,200
Arctic is the fastest warming part of the planet, Goddard and NOAA show much more warming than

68
00:05:55,200 --> 00:06:01,680
Hadcrut. I showed this in my last video, has the earth been cooling? It's not hard to spot other

69
00:06:01,680 --> 00:06:08,480
errors and misquotes. The Daily Mail told us that Jones conceded the possibility that the world was

70
00:06:08,480 --> 00:06:13,840
warmer in medieval times than now, but that's rather like asking a climatologist who argues

71
00:06:13,840 --> 00:06:19,600
that the medieval warm period was warmer than today whether it's possible it was cooler. If

72
00:06:19,600 --> 00:06:25,040
he's being honest, then he'd say yes, of course it's possible. That shouldn't be misconstrued as

73
00:06:25,040 --> 00:06:30,240
a concession or an admission that he's wrong. The geographical extent and nature of the medieval

74
00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:36,080
warm period is not known. In the BBC interview, Jones gives a fair summary of the state of our

75
00:06:36,080 --> 00:06:43,440
understanding. Read it. He doesn't concede or do a U-turn on anything. The Daily Mail goes from that

76
00:06:43,440 --> 00:06:49,200
to this. Skeptics said this was the first time a senior scientist working with the IPCC

77
00:06:49,200 --> 00:06:54,400
had admitted to the possibility that the medieval warming period could have been global, and

78
00:06:54,400 --> 00:06:59,440
therefore the world could have been hotter then than now. Of course the Mail doesn't say who these

79
00:06:59,440 --> 00:07:04,880
skeptics are. They could be the office cleaners, but they're wrong and the Mail didn't bother to

80
00:07:04,880 --> 00:07:12,720
check. Here's part of the IPCC's fourth assessment report on climate change in 2007. Section 661 has

81
00:07:12,720 --> 00:07:18,880
a long dissertation on the nature of the medieval warm period, which includes these lines in box 64.

82
00:07:19,600 --> 00:07:25,360
In medieval times, as now, climate was unlikely to have changed in the same direction or by the

83
00:07:25,360 --> 00:07:31,200
same magnitude everywhere. In other words, the IPCC doesn't say there's no way the warm climate

84
00:07:31,200 --> 00:07:36,400
could have been global or that it definitely wasn't. It concludes that it's unlikely to have

85
00:07:36,400 --> 00:07:42,400
been global. The IPCC clearly accepts the possibility that it wasn't. But nobody at the

86
00:07:42,400 --> 00:07:47,920
Daily Mail bothered to check the latest IPCC documents to substantiate the claim that it

87
00:07:47,920 --> 00:07:53,760
doesn't accept such a possibility. And neither did any of the scores of blogs and commentators

88
00:07:53,760 --> 00:07:58,560
who parroted this assertion. But then the Daily Mail goes on to make an assumption

89
00:07:58,560 --> 00:08:02,080
based on what it thinks is Professor Jones doing a U-turn.

90
00:08:04,960 --> 00:08:10,480
This suggestion doesn't come from Jones or the BBC or anyone named by the Mail. It seems to come

91
00:08:10,480 --> 00:08:15,600
from the writer and editor at the Mail who put the story together. I know a lot of editors at

92
00:08:15,600 --> 00:08:20,480
the Mail and the nugget of science they understand is so small it can be drowned in their lunchtime

93
00:08:20,480 --> 00:08:25,920
gins and tonics. They shouldn't be used as a credible source on this complicated aspect

94
00:08:25,920 --> 00:08:31,600
of science. So once again I would urge internet lovers to be sceptical. Don't believe something

95
00:08:31,600 --> 00:08:36,160
you read simply because it's in a tabloid newspaper. If it gives no source for the

96
00:08:36,160 --> 00:08:41,920
information, treat it with scepticism. If it does give a source, don't let the tabloid editors

97
00:08:41,920 --> 00:08:47,680
interpret it for you. Read the source yourself and check whether the interpretation you've been given

98
00:08:47,680 --> 00:08:49,520
is accurate.
