800	4880	I have to add an addendum to my last video, because no sooner had it come out
4880	9120	than the perfect example of what I was saying was splashed all over the internet.
9120	14160	It was a headline that read, there has been no global warming since 1995,
14160	18080	and I'm sure you've all seen it. The source for most of these stories,
18080	22720	and even the headline, was an article in Britain's Daily Mail on February the 14th.
22720	24720	But remember what I said in my last video?
25440	29280	Find out where the information comes from. Is the source reliable?
29280	33840	Does the information you've been given accurately reflect the information from the source?
33840	38640	So instead of trusting the Daily Mail to accurately report what Phil Jones said,
38640	44000	why don't we go to the BBC website and read the transcript and find out what he actually said.
44720	46960	The headline in the Daily Mail was this,
46960	53440	Climategate U-turn as scientist at Centre of Rau admits there has been no global warming since 1995.
53440	57200	But that's not what Phil Jones said. If we go to the source,
57200	62080	the BBC transcript, we find this. Phil Jones was asked if he agreed that from
62080	67200	1995 to the present there's been no statistically significant global warming.
67760	74640	Yes, he said, but only just. I also calculated the trend for the period 1995 to 2009.
74640	82080	This trend, 0.12 degrees centigrade per decade, is positive, but not significant at the 95%
82080	86320	significance level. The positive trend is quite close to the significance level.
86880	91840	This is not the same as saying there's been no warming. Firstly, the word significant in
91840	97040	statistics doesn't indicate how much or how important something is, but how more likely
97040	101840	it is to have occurred by chance. It's a function of the strength of the thing you're measuring,
101840	105040	the strength of the background noise, and the size of the sample.
105600	110800	Phil Jones and his team could measure global warming, he even gave the BBC the figure.
110800	115200	But they couldn't be absolutely sure that this trend was real and not just a chance
115200	120160	anomaly caused by background variations in temperature. Most researchers aim for
120160	127440	a significance level of 95%, meaning they've got 95% confidence that a trend is real and not chance.
128400	132320	Jones said he got close to that. I don't know what figure he reached,
132320	138320	but just for an example, let's say it was 80%. That would mean there's an 80% probability that
138400	145360	the warming he detected between 1995 and 2009 was an underlying trend and not a chance result
145360	150080	caused by natural background temperature fluctuations. Of course, the greater your
150080	154960	sample size or the longer you measure something, the more significant your results become.
155600	160800	Let's go to the beach for an example. It's a bit like measuring waves coming onto the shore.
160800	166000	If you mark how far each wave comes up the sand with a flag, can you tell whether the tide's
166000	171840	coming in? Over a short period of time, say half an hour, your flags might progress very slightly
171840	176960	up the beach, which would indicate that the tide's coming in, but the distance is so small
176960	182080	that it's possible it's been distorted by one or two strong waves. To use the Daily Mail's
182080	186640	understanding, this means there's been no movement up the sand for half an hour, so the tide can't
186640	192800	be coming in. But it doesn't. It means there has been movement up the sand, but it's not enough
192800	197360	and the time scale is too short to say with confidence that the tide is coming in.
198400	202320	OK, one more example and then I'll shut up about statistical significance.
202960	207680	God, I hate statistics. Let's say you're suspicious that a die has been weighted in
207680	213120	favour of falling on a six. If you roll the die a couple of times and it comes up with sixes both
213120	218800	times, can you say with confidence that it's been weighted? No, because you could have got
218800	223920	those two sixes through pure chance. So you keep rolling and here's what you get.
224480	231840	A six, a five, a six, a six, a four and two more sixes. How confident are you now?
232560	237280	Well, it's beginning to look as though the results are because of weighting rather than chance.
237280	242720	The significance of our results is rising, but it still could be chance. If we're almost at
242720	248560	the 95% significance level but not quite there, what would the Daily Mail make of these results?
249280	253920	They'd say that since the figure isn't significant it means the die isn't weighted.
254800	259440	OK, it's complicated but this is why science is published in scientific journals,
259440	264400	not in the tabloid press. The Daily Mail did get the quote right in the body of the story
264400	269360	but didn't explain what it meant, so readers were left with the impression from the headline
269360	275120	that it meant there's been no warming. So why did Jones go on to say in the BBC interview
275120	281040	he was 100% confident that the climate has warmed? Well, I can't speak for him and I don't
281040	287520	think any scientist can express 100% confidence in anything. But what he was probably referring to
287520	293760	was that the CRU, together with the Hadley Centre, has more than just 15 years of data to draw on.
293760	299200	Let's go back to the analogy. If we keep planting flags over a longer period of time,
299200	304400	say an hour, the movement of flags up the beach overcomes the background noise of advancing and
304400	310080	retreating waves and it becomes very clear that the tide is coming in. So Jones is looking at
310080	315920	over 30 years of data which shows the warming trend very clearly. Not surprisingly, the Daily
315920	321440	Mail completely omitted Jones's statement that the earth was warming. If we look at data from
321440	327120	the other surface temperature monitoring bodies, the GISS and NOAA, the warming trend comes through
327120	332560	more clearly so the statistical significance is higher. This is because there are few weather
332560	338400	stations in the Arctic or Antarctic so Hadcrut, that's the CRU and the Hadley Centre's combined
338400	344800	data, leaves these areas out. Goddard and NOAA extrapolate Arctic and Antarctic temperatures
344800	350320	from the nearest available weather stations, so their coverage is more extensive. Since the
350320	355200	Arctic is the fastest warming part of the planet, Goddard and NOAA show much more warming than
355200	361680	Hadcrut. I showed this in my last video, has the earth been cooling? It's not hard to spot other
361680	368480	errors and misquotes. The Daily Mail told us that Jones conceded the possibility that the world was
368480	373840	warmer in medieval times than now, but that's rather like asking a climatologist who argues
373840	379600	that the medieval warm period was warmer than today whether it's possible it was cooler. If
379600	385040	he's being honest, then he'd say yes, of course it's possible. That shouldn't be misconstrued as
385040	390240	a concession or an admission that he's wrong. The geographical extent and nature of the medieval
390240	396080	warm period is not known. In the BBC interview, Jones gives a fair summary of the state of our
396080	403440	understanding. Read it. He doesn't concede or do a U-turn on anything. The Daily Mail goes from that
403440	409200	to this. Skeptics said this was the first time a senior scientist working with the IPCC
409200	414400	had admitted to the possibility that the medieval warming period could have been global, and
414400	419440	therefore the world could have been hotter then than now. Of course the Mail doesn't say who these
419440	424880	skeptics are. They could be the office cleaners, but they're wrong and the Mail didn't bother to
424880	432720	check. Here's part of the IPCC's fourth assessment report on climate change in 2007. Section 661 has
432720	438880	a long dissertation on the nature of the medieval warm period, which includes these lines in box 64.
439600	445360	In medieval times, as now, climate was unlikely to have changed in the same direction or by the
445360	451200	same magnitude everywhere. In other words, the IPCC doesn't say there's no way the warm climate
451200	456400	could have been global or that it definitely wasn't. It concludes that it's unlikely to have
456400	462400	been global. The IPCC clearly accepts the possibility that it wasn't. But nobody at the
462400	467920	Daily Mail bothered to check the latest IPCC documents to substantiate the claim that it
467920	473760	doesn't accept such a possibility. And neither did any of the scores of blogs and commentators
473760	478560	who parroted this assertion. But then the Daily Mail goes on to make an assumption
478560	482080	based on what it thinks is Professor Jones doing a U-turn.
484960	490480	This suggestion doesn't come from Jones or the BBC or anyone named by the Mail. It seems to come
490480	495600	from the writer and editor at the Mail who put the story together. I know a lot of editors at
495600	500480	the Mail and the nugget of science they understand is so small it can be drowned in their lunchtime
500480	505920	gins and tonics. They shouldn't be used as a credible source on this complicated aspect
505920	511600	of science. So once again I would urge internet lovers to be sceptical. Don't believe something
511600	516160	you read simply because it's in a tabloid newspaper. If it gives no source for the
516160	521920	information, treat it with scepticism. If it does give a source, don't let the tabloid editors
521920	527680	interpret it for you. Read the source yourself and check whether the interpretation you've been given
527680	529520	is accurate.
