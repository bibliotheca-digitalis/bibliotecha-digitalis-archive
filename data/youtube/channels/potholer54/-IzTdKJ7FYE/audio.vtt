00:00.000 --> 00:05.040
Now listen, if you went scuba diving and you found a treasure chest full of gold coins,

00:05.040 --> 00:08.720
and I asked you the simple question, when did the boat sink?

00:08.720 --> 00:14.000
No, we haven't resurrected Kent Hovind for another coveted golden crocodile. I just want

00:14.000 --> 00:18.480
you to watch carefully as he leads his audience through a fairly simple piece of mathematical

00:18.480 --> 00:23.520
logic, and we're going to compare it with his son's preaching of exactly the same story.

00:23.680 --> 00:29.760
If we were to go scuba diving and we found a treasure chest full of gold coins,

00:30.480 --> 00:35.680
and I ask you the simple question, hey, when did that boat sink?

00:36.240 --> 00:40.240
And you say, I don't know. Look at the dates on the coins.

00:41.120 --> 00:46.560
See, if there's a coin in there from 1750, you ought to be able to figure out the boat

00:46.560 --> 00:53.040
sank after 1750. How many can figure this out with no help?

00:53.040 --> 00:55.760
Well, sure, that would be easy for a third grader, right?

00:56.320 --> 01:01.440
But notice how Hovind only asks the audience if they were able to figure this out after he's

01:01.440 --> 01:06.320
already given them the answer. We're going to find out why in a segment called,

01:06.320 --> 01:07.840
I Should Have Listened to My Daddy.

01:15.280 --> 01:21.040
Watch how young Eric Hovind preaches exactly the same thing, but with one crucial difference.

01:21.040 --> 01:26.400
He didn't learn this lesson from his daddy. No matter how easy it is, you never,

01:26.400 --> 01:30.960
ever ask a room full of creationists a question that requires the mathematical

01:30.960 --> 01:34.720
skills of a third grader. Because if you find a coin in there from,

01:34.720 --> 01:43.040
let's see here, 1750, then you know the boat sank when? Before 1750 or after 1750?

01:44.240 --> 01:48.480
Told you. After 1750.

01:48.480 --> 01:53.600
No, not before 1750 because we've got a coin in there from 1750.

01:54.160 --> 01:58.080
Now believe me, Eric, in the next 20 seconds this creationist audience

01:58.080 --> 02:02.640
isn't going to get any smarter, so please don't ask them anything else.

02:02.640 --> 02:09.200
Then I find one in there that is from 1859. Don't do it.

02:09.200 --> 02:13.360
Now we've even limited even farther. Hey, when we're trying to figure out when that boat sank,

02:13.360 --> 02:16.480
do I look for the oldest coin or the youngest coin?

02:16.480 --> 02:21.200
The youngest coin. All right, we'll get it figured out here.

02:21.200 --> 02:25.600
No, they won't. Remember these are people who wonder why there are still monkeys if

02:25.600 --> 02:30.640
we all descended from monkeys. Your audience doesn't want to have to figure these things out.

02:30.640 --> 02:35.600
All they want you to do is give them a piece of information and they'll be happy to believe it.

02:35.600 --> 02:39.760
Like this. You don't go poking around in the box and find the oldest coin. You find the

02:39.760 --> 02:44.000
youngest coin and that becomes what is called the limiting factor. The boat could not be

02:44.000 --> 02:48.400
older than that. The point about this limiting factor is that Hovind senior wants to apply it

02:48.400 --> 02:53.920
to the age of the earth and Hovind junior wants to copy whatever Hovind senior did.

02:54.480 --> 02:58.800
And so we come to the limiting factor that is the distance of the moon.

02:58.800 --> 03:03.760
The moon is going around the earth. How many knew that already? The moon goes around the earth.

03:03.760 --> 03:07.520
I don't know. The moon goes around the earth. That's good, Eric.

03:07.520 --> 03:10.320
How many of you guys knew that already? You guys had that figured out? Okay,

03:10.320 --> 03:14.320
the moon goes around the earth. Yep. By the way, does anybody know its official name?

03:14.320 --> 03:18.480
It's called the moon, Eric. That's way too hard. Cut to daddy.

03:18.480 --> 03:21.760
Did you know as the moon goes around, it's gradually getting farther away?

03:21.760 --> 03:26.960
We're slowly losing the moon. The moon is getting farther and farther away from the earth.

03:26.960 --> 03:30.160
Good. Now give it some drama. Guys, we're losing the moon.

03:30.160 --> 03:34.080
Not that much. The moon is getting farther from the earth every year.

03:34.080 --> 03:42.560
So that means that it used to be closer. Because you go backwards in time. Let's see,

03:42.560 --> 03:46.640
if the moon is here and it's getting farther away, that means that it used to be

03:48.080 --> 03:52.000
closer to the earth. Good job. I think they might just have grasped that.

03:52.640 --> 03:57.360
Well, now I've got some sad news to relate, Eric. While your daddy was great at reaching

03:57.360 --> 04:03.360
down to the scientific level of his audience, he wasn't very, how can I put this, enlightened

04:03.360 --> 04:09.840
when it came to basic science himself. He gained the title Doctor through this doctoral dissertation

04:09.840 --> 04:16.560
submitted to this university. To put it delicately, he was great at quoting the Bible,

04:16.560 --> 04:22.480
but he sucked at physics. And that's what's got you landed with a Golden Crocoduck nomination.

04:23.200 --> 04:27.600
So that brings us to the next segment called I Shouldn't Have Listened to My Daddy.

04:35.520 --> 04:39.680
And if you run all the math on this, you'll find out about 1.2 billion years ago,

04:40.240 --> 04:44.720
the moon was whizzing around just above the surface of the earth. You go back about 1.3

04:44.720 --> 04:50.400
billion years, now you've got a serious problem. Because the moon is skimming the surface of the

04:50.400 --> 04:55.280
earth. See, the thing is this. Obviously the moon couldn't have been skimming the surface of the

04:55.280 --> 05:00.880
earth 1.3 billion years ago. That's impossible. So something must be wrong with your daddy's

05:00.880 --> 05:06.560
calculation. And it's quite easy to figure out what it is. His calculation was based on the

05:06.560 --> 05:12.800
assumption that the moon has always been receding at the same rate, 3.8 centimetres a year. But of

05:12.800 --> 05:18.160
course it hasn't. We know this through a simple principle of physics that Hoeven senior comes

05:18.160 --> 05:23.200
very close to understanding. Because the moon causes the tides. Now what's the consequence of

05:23.200 --> 05:28.640
the moon's gravitation causing tides? Well I'm going to exaggerate it in this diagram so you can

05:28.640 --> 05:34.560
see what's happening. The moon's gravitational attraction causes a bulge of ocean water in the

05:34.560 --> 05:40.320
part of the earth closest to it. Because the earth spins faster than the moon orbits, this bulge

05:40.320 --> 05:46.000
pulls a little ahead of the moon. And it reciprocates the gravitational tug by tugging at the

05:46.000 --> 05:51.840
moon itself, as if there was an invisible rope between them. So the moon is dragging on the

05:51.840 --> 05:57.360
earth's spin, slowing it down a fraction of a millisecond every year. And the bulge is pulling

05:57.360 --> 06:02.720
on the moon, giving it more energy. Through the conservation of angular momentum, the momentum

06:02.720 --> 06:09.200
lost by the earth must be gained by the moon. As it gains energy, the moon moves to a higher orbit.

06:09.200 --> 06:16.400
That's why it's receding. So to assume that the moon has always been receding at the same rate,

06:16.400 --> 06:21.760
you have to assume that the tidal configuration we have today has always been the same. And of

06:21.760 --> 06:27.120
course it hasn't. The drag exerted by the tides depends on the configuration and depth of the

06:27.120 --> 06:32.560
oceans. For most of the earth's history, the oceans were much more extensive. And of course

06:32.560 --> 06:38.320
we have continental drift, which encourages the formation of super continents and super oceans.

06:39.840 --> 06:45.040
Fortunately, we don't need to guess what effect this has on recession rates. We can work it out,

06:45.040 --> 06:50.720
because we know where the moon was in the past. How do we know? I don't know. Because some coastal

06:50.720 --> 06:56.400
and estuarine sediments in the past, just like today, were laid down with the rhythm of the tides,

06:56.400 --> 07:01.360
so we can see how many tides there were in a year. And from coral growth and other seasonal

07:01.360 --> 07:06.560
indicators, geologists can work out how many days there were in a year, and therefore how fast the

07:06.560 --> 07:11.760
earth was spinning. And since the period of the moon's orbit is directly linked to its orbital

07:11.760 --> 07:16.160
radius, then we can work out the distance of the moon from the earth at various times.

07:16.800 --> 07:21.200
And that tells us how much the moon receded in the intervals between those times.

07:22.080 --> 07:27.120
This paper by Williams takes us back nearly 2.5 billion years, and during most of the

07:27.120 --> 07:35.520
Proterozoic, 2,450 to 620 million years ago, it turns out the moon was receding at about 1.24

07:35.520 --> 07:43.280
centimetres a year, and around 2.17 centimetres a year since then. In other words, much less than

07:43.280 --> 07:49.920
it is today. So Hovind's vision of the moon skimming the surface of the earth 1.2 or 1.3

07:49.920 --> 07:55.840
billion years ago only works if the recession has been constant, which it hasn't. When we look at

07:55.840 --> 08:00.960
the geological evidence, it turns out that 2.5 billion years ago the moon was only about 10%

08:01.520 --> 08:08.000
closer to the earth than it is today. That's hardly skimming the surface. The varying recession

08:08.000 --> 08:13.920
of the moon was known as far back as 1990, but Hovind Sr didn't bother to check all this because

08:13.920 --> 08:19.440
he's simply regurgitating the musings of other creationists who preceded him. And young Eric

08:19.440 --> 08:23.120
didn't question it because, well, he just listens to daddy.
