1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,040
Now listen, if you went scuba diving and you found a treasure chest full of gold coins,

2
00:00:05,040 --> 00:00:08,720
and I asked you the simple question, when did the boat sink?

3
00:00:08,720 --> 00:00:14,000
No, we haven't resurrected Kent Hovind for another coveted golden crocodile. I just want

4
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:18,480
you to watch carefully as he leads his audience through a fairly simple piece of mathematical

5
00:00:18,480 --> 00:00:23,520
logic, and we're going to compare it with his son's preaching of exactly the same story.

6
00:00:23,680 --> 00:00:29,760
If we were to go scuba diving and we found a treasure chest full of gold coins,

7
00:00:30,480 --> 00:00:35,680
and I ask you the simple question, hey, when did that boat sink?

8
00:00:36,240 --> 00:00:40,240
And you say, I don't know. Look at the dates on the coins.

9
00:00:41,120 --> 00:00:46,560
See, if there's a coin in there from 1750, you ought to be able to figure out the boat

10
00:00:46,560 --> 00:00:53,040
sank after 1750. How many can figure this out with no help?

11
00:00:53,040 --> 00:00:55,760
Well, sure, that would be easy for a third grader, right?

12
00:00:56,320 --> 00:01:01,440
But notice how Hovind only asks the audience if they were able to figure this out after he's

13
00:01:01,440 --> 00:01:06,320
already given them the answer. We're going to find out why in a segment called,

14
00:01:06,320 --> 00:01:07,840
I Should Have Listened to My Daddy.

15
00:01:15,280 --> 00:01:21,040
Watch how young Eric Hovind preaches exactly the same thing, but with one crucial difference.

16
00:01:21,040 --> 00:01:26,400
He didn't learn this lesson from his daddy. No matter how easy it is, you never,

17
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:30,960
ever ask a room full of creationists a question that requires the mathematical

18
00:01:30,960 --> 00:01:34,720
skills of a third grader. Because if you find a coin in there from,

19
00:01:34,720 --> 00:01:43,040
let's see here, 1750, then you know the boat sank when? Before 1750 or after 1750?

20
00:01:44,240 --> 00:01:48,480
Told you. After 1750.

21
00:01:48,480 --> 00:01:53,600
No, not before 1750 because we've got a coin in there from 1750.

22
00:01:54,160 --> 00:01:58,080
Now believe me, Eric, in the next 20 seconds this creationist audience

23
00:01:58,080 --> 00:02:02,640
isn't going to get any smarter, so please don't ask them anything else.

24
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:09,200
Then I find one in there that is from 1859. Don't do it.

25
00:02:09,200 --> 00:02:13,360
Now we've even limited even farther. Hey, when we're trying to figure out when that boat sank,

26
00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:16,480
do I look for the oldest coin or the youngest coin?

27
00:02:16,480 --> 00:02:21,200
The youngest coin. All right, we'll get it figured out here.

28
00:02:21,200 --> 00:02:25,600
No, they won't. Remember these are people who wonder why there are still monkeys if

29
00:02:25,600 --> 00:02:30,640
we all descended from monkeys. Your audience doesn't want to have to figure these things out.

30
00:02:30,640 --> 00:02:35,600
All they want you to do is give them a piece of information and they'll be happy to believe it.

31
00:02:35,600 --> 00:02:39,760
Like this. You don't go poking around in the box and find the oldest coin. You find the

32
00:02:39,760 --> 00:02:44,000
youngest coin and that becomes what is called the limiting factor. The boat could not be

33
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:48,400
older than that. The point about this limiting factor is that Hovind senior wants to apply it

34
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:53,920
to the age of the earth and Hovind junior wants to copy whatever Hovind senior did.

35
00:02:54,480 --> 00:02:58,800
And so we come to the limiting factor that is the distance of the moon.

36
00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:03,760
The moon is going around the earth. How many knew that already? The moon goes around the earth.

37
00:03:03,760 --> 00:03:07,520
I don't know. The moon goes around the earth. That's good, Eric.

38
00:03:07,520 --> 00:03:10,320
How many of you guys knew that already? You guys had that figured out? Okay,

39
00:03:10,320 --> 00:03:14,320
the moon goes around the earth. Yep. By the way, does anybody know its official name?

40
00:03:14,320 --> 00:03:18,480
It's called the moon, Eric. That's way too hard. Cut to daddy.

41
00:03:18,480 --> 00:03:21,760
Did you know as the moon goes around, it's gradually getting farther away?

42
00:03:21,760 --> 00:03:26,960
We're slowly losing the moon. The moon is getting farther and farther away from the earth.

43
00:03:26,960 --> 00:03:30,160
Good. Now give it some drama. Guys, we're losing the moon.

44
00:03:30,160 --> 00:03:34,080
Not that much. The moon is getting farther from the earth every year.

45
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:42,560
So that means that it used to be closer. Because you go backwards in time. Let's see,

46
00:03:42,560 --> 00:03:46,640
if the moon is here and it's getting farther away, that means that it used to be

47
00:03:48,080 --> 00:03:52,000
closer to the earth. Good job. I think they might just have grasped that.

48
00:03:52,640 --> 00:03:57,360
Well, now I've got some sad news to relate, Eric. While your daddy was great at reaching

49
00:03:57,360 --> 00:04:03,360
down to the scientific level of his audience, he wasn't very, how can I put this, enlightened

50
00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:09,840
when it came to basic science himself. He gained the title Doctor through this doctoral dissertation

51
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:16,560
submitted to this university. To put it delicately, he was great at quoting the Bible,

52
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:22,480
but he sucked at physics. And that's what's got you landed with a Golden Crocoduck nomination.

53
00:04:23,200 --> 00:04:27,600
So that brings us to the next segment called I Shouldn't Have Listened to My Daddy.

54
00:04:35,520 --> 00:04:39,680
And if you run all the math on this, you'll find out about 1.2 billion years ago,

55
00:04:40,240 --> 00:04:44,720
the moon was whizzing around just above the surface of the earth. You go back about 1.3

56
00:04:44,720 --> 00:04:50,400
billion years, now you've got a serious problem. Because the moon is skimming the surface of the

57
00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:55,280
earth. See, the thing is this. Obviously the moon couldn't have been skimming the surface of the

58
00:04:55,280 --> 00:05:00,880
earth 1.3 billion years ago. That's impossible. So something must be wrong with your daddy's

59
00:05:00,880 --> 00:05:06,560
calculation. And it's quite easy to figure out what it is. His calculation was based on the

60
00:05:06,560 --> 00:05:12,800
assumption that the moon has always been receding at the same rate, 3.8 centimetres a year. But of

61
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:18,160
course it hasn't. We know this through a simple principle of physics that Hoeven senior comes

62
00:05:18,160 --> 00:05:23,200
very close to understanding. Because the moon causes the tides. Now what's the consequence of

63
00:05:23,200 --> 00:05:28,640
the moon's gravitation causing tides? Well I'm going to exaggerate it in this diagram so you can

64
00:05:28,640 --> 00:05:34,560
see what's happening. The moon's gravitational attraction causes a bulge of ocean water in the

65
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:40,320
part of the earth closest to it. Because the earth spins faster than the moon orbits, this bulge

66
00:05:40,320 --> 00:05:46,000
pulls a little ahead of the moon. And it reciprocates the gravitational tug by tugging at the

67
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:51,840
moon itself, as if there was an invisible rope between them. So the moon is dragging on the

68
00:05:51,840 --> 00:05:57,360
earth's spin, slowing it down a fraction of a millisecond every year. And the bulge is pulling

69
00:05:57,360 --> 00:06:02,720
on the moon, giving it more energy. Through the conservation of angular momentum, the momentum

70
00:06:02,720 --> 00:06:09,200
lost by the earth must be gained by the moon. As it gains energy, the moon moves to a higher orbit.

71
00:06:09,200 --> 00:06:16,400
That's why it's receding. So to assume that the moon has always been receding at the same rate,

72
00:06:16,400 --> 00:06:21,760
you have to assume that the tidal configuration we have today has always been the same. And of

73
00:06:21,760 --> 00:06:27,120
course it hasn't. The drag exerted by the tides depends on the configuration and depth of the

74
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:32,560
oceans. For most of the earth's history, the oceans were much more extensive. And of course

75
00:06:32,560 --> 00:06:38,320
we have continental drift, which encourages the formation of super continents and super oceans.

76
00:06:39,840 --> 00:06:45,040
Fortunately, we don't need to guess what effect this has on recession rates. We can work it out,

77
00:06:45,040 --> 00:06:50,720
because we know where the moon was in the past. How do we know? I don't know. Because some coastal

78
00:06:50,720 --> 00:06:56,400
and estuarine sediments in the past, just like today, were laid down with the rhythm of the tides,

79
00:06:56,400 --> 00:07:01,360
so we can see how many tides there were in a year. And from coral growth and other seasonal

80
00:07:01,360 --> 00:07:06,560
indicators, geologists can work out how many days there were in a year, and therefore how fast the

81
00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:11,760
earth was spinning. And since the period of the moon's orbit is directly linked to its orbital

82
00:07:11,760 --> 00:07:16,160
radius, then we can work out the distance of the moon from the earth at various times.

83
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:21,200
And that tells us how much the moon receded in the intervals between those times.

84
00:07:22,080 --> 00:07:27,120
This paper by Williams takes us back nearly 2.5 billion years, and during most of the

85
00:07:27,120 --> 00:07:35,520
Proterozoic, 2,450 to 620 million years ago, it turns out the moon was receding at about 1.24

86
00:07:35,520 --> 00:07:43,280
centimetres a year, and around 2.17 centimetres a year since then. In other words, much less than

87
00:07:43,280 --> 00:07:49,920
it is today. So Hovind's vision of the moon skimming the surface of the earth 1.2 or 1.3

88
00:07:49,920 --> 00:07:55,840
billion years ago only works if the recession has been constant, which it hasn't. When we look at

89
00:07:55,840 --> 00:08:00,960
the geological evidence, it turns out that 2.5 billion years ago the moon was only about 10%

90
00:08:01,520 --> 00:08:08,000
closer to the earth than it is today. That's hardly skimming the surface. The varying recession

91
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:13,920
of the moon was known as far back as 1990, but Hovind Sr didn't bother to check all this because

92
00:08:13,920 --> 00:08:19,440
he's simply regurgitating the musings of other creationists who preceded him. And young Eric

93
00:08:19,440 --> 00:08:23,120
didn't question it because, well, he just listens to daddy.
