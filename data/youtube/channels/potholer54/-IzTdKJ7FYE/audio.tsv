0	5040	Now listen, if you went scuba diving and you found a treasure chest full of gold coins,
5040	8720	and I asked you the simple question, when did the boat sink?
8720	14000	No, we haven't resurrected Kent Hovind for another coveted golden crocodile. I just want
14000	18480	you to watch carefully as he leads his audience through a fairly simple piece of mathematical
18480	23520	logic, and we're going to compare it with his son's preaching of exactly the same story.
23680	29760	If we were to go scuba diving and we found a treasure chest full of gold coins,
30480	35680	and I ask you the simple question, hey, when did that boat sink?
36240	40240	And you say, I don't know. Look at the dates on the coins.
41120	46560	See, if there's a coin in there from 1750, you ought to be able to figure out the boat
46560	53040	sank after 1750. How many can figure this out with no help?
53040	55760	Well, sure, that would be easy for a third grader, right?
56320	61440	But notice how Hovind only asks the audience if they were able to figure this out after he's
61440	66320	already given them the answer. We're going to find out why in a segment called,
66320	67840	I Should Have Listened to My Daddy.
75280	81040	Watch how young Eric Hovind preaches exactly the same thing, but with one crucial difference.
81040	86400	He didn't learn this lesson from his daddy. No matter how easy it is, you never,
86400	90960	ever ask a room full of creationists a question that requires the mathematical
90960	94720	skills of a third grader. Because if you find a coin in there from,
94720	103040	let's see here, 1750, then you know the boat sank when? Before 1750 or after 1750?
104240	108480	Told you. After 1750.
108480	113600	No, not before 1750 because we've got a coin in there from 1750.
114160	118080	Now believe me, Eric, in the next 20 seconds this creationist audience
118080	122640	isn't going to get any smarter, so please don't ask them anything else.
122640	129200	Then I find one in there that is from 1859. Don't do it.
129200	133360	Now we've even limited even farther. Hey, when we're trying to figure out when that boat sank,
133360	136480	do I look for the oldest coin or the youngest coin?
136480	141200	The youngest coin. All right, we'll get it figured out here.
141200	145600	No, they won't. Remember these are people who wonder why there are still monkeys if
145600	150640	we all descended from monkeys. Your audience doesn't want to have to figure these things out.
150640	155600	All they want you to do is give them a piece of information and they'll be happy to believe it.
155600	159760	Like this. You don't go poking around in the box and find the oldest coin. You find the
159760	164000	youngest coin and that becomes what is called the limiting factor. The boat could not be
164000	168400	older than that. The point about this limiting factor is that Hovind senior wants to apply it
168400	173920	to the age of the earth and Hovind junior wants to copy whatever Hovind senior did.
174480	178800	And so we come to the limiting factor that is the distance of the moon.
178800	183760	The moon is going around the earth. How many knew that already? The moon goes around the earth.
183760	187520	I don't know. The moon goes around the earth. That's good, Eric.
187520	190320	How many of you guys knew that already? You guys had that figured out? Okay,
190320	194320	the moon goes around the earth. Yep. By the way, does anybody know its official name?
194320	198480	It's called the moon, Eric. That's way too hard. Cut to daddy.
198480	201760	Did you know as the moon goes around, it's gradually getting farther away?
201760	206960	We're slowly losing the moon. The moon is getting farther and farther away from the earth.
206960	210160	Good. Now give it some drama. Guys, we're losing the moon.
210160	214080	Not that much. The moon is getting farther from the earth every year.
214080	222560	So that means that it used to be closer. Because you go backwards in time. Let's see,
222560	226640	if the moon is here and it's getting farther away, that means that it used to be
228080	232000	closer to the earth. Good job. I think they might just have grasped that.
232640	237360	Well, now I've got some sad news to relate, Eric. While your daddy was great at reaching
237360	243360	down to the scientific level of his audience, he wasn't very, how can I put this, enlightened
243360	249840	when it came to basic science himself. He gained the title Doctor through this doctoral dissertation
249840	256560	submitted to this university. To put it delicately, he was great at quoting the Bible,
256560	262480	but he sucked at physics. And that's what's got you landed with a Golden Crocoduck nomination.
263200	267600	So that brings us to the next segment called I Shouldn't Have Listened to My Daddy.
275520	279680	And if you run all the math on this, you'll find out about 1.2 billion years ago,
280240	284720	the moon was whizzing around just above the surface of the earth. You go back about 1.3
284720	290400	billion years, now you've got a serious problem. Because the moon is skimming the surface of the
290400	295280	earth. See, the thing is this. Obviously the moon couldn't have been skimming the surface of the
295280	300880	earth 1.3 billion years ago. That's impossible. So something must be wrong with your daddy's
300880	306560	calculation. And it's quite easy to figure out what it is. His calculation was based on the
306560	312800	assumption that the moon has always been receding at the same rate, 3.8 centimetres a year. But of
312800	318160	course it hasn't. We know this through a simple principle of physics that Hoeven senior comes
318160	323200	very close to understanding. Because the moon causes the tides. Now what's the consequence of
323200	328640	the moon's gravitation causing tides? Well I'm going to exaggerate it in this diagram so you can
328640	334560	see what's happening. The moon's gravitational attraction causes a bulge of ocean water in the
334560	340320	part of the earth closest to it. Because the earth spins faster than the moon orbits, this bulge
340320	346000	pulls a little ahead of the moon. And it reciprocates the gravitational tug by tugging at the
346000	351840	moon itself, as if there was an invisible rope between them. So the moon is dragging on the
351840	357360	earth's spin, slowing it down a fraction of a millisecond every year. And the bulge is pulling
357360	362720	on the moon, giving it more energy. Through the conservation of angular momentum, the momentum
362720	369200	lost by the earth must be gained by the moon. As it gains energy, the moon moves to a higher orbit.
369200	376400	That's why it's receding. So to assume that the moon has always been receding at the same rate,
376400	381760	you have to assume that the tidal configuration we have today has always been the same. And of
381760	387120	course it hasn't. The drag exerted by the tides depends on the configuration and depth of the
387120	392560	oceans. For most of the earth's history, the oceans were much more extensive. And of course
392560	398320	we have continental drift, which encourages the formation of super continents and super oceans.
399840	405040	Fortunately, we don't need to guess what effect this has on recession rates. We can work it out,
405040	410720	because we know where the moon was in the past. How do we know? I don't know. Because some coastal
410720	416400	and estuarine sediments in the past, just like today, were laid down with the rhythm of the tides,
416400	421360	so we can see how many tides there were in a year. And from coral growth and other seasonal
421360	426560	indicators, geologists can work out how many days there were in a year, and therefore how fast the
426560	431760	earth was spinning. And since the period of the moon's orbit is directly linked to its orbital
431760	436160	radius, then we can work out the distance of the moon from the earth at various times.
436800	441200	And that tells us how much the moon receded in the intervals between those times.
442080	447120	This paper by Williams takes us back nearly 2.5 billion years, and during most of the
447120	455520	Proterozoic, 2,450 to 620 million years ago, it turns out the moon was receding at about 1.24
455520	463280	centimetres a year, and around 2.17 centimetres a year since then. In other words, much less than
463280	469920	it is today. So Hovind's vision of the moon skimming the surface of the earth 1.2 or 1.3
469920	475840	billion years ago only works if the recession has been constant, which it hasn't. When we look at
475840	480960	the geological evidence, it turns out that 2.5 billion years ago the moon was only about 10%
481520	488000	closer to the earth than it is today. That's hardly skimming the surface. The varying recession
488000	493920	of the moon was known as far back as 1990, but Hovind Sr didn't bother to check all this because
493920	499440	he's simply regurgitating the musings of other creationists who preceded him. And young Eric
499440	503120	didn't question it because, well, he just listens to daddy.
