00:00.000 --> 00:05.140
When I started my geology course at university many years ago I learnt something extraordinary

00:05.140 --> 00:11.140
on the very first day. Most of the rocks we see around us started life as flat beds laid

00:11.140 --> 00:17.460
down at the bottom of the sea. I was shocked, so I put my hand up and asked the obvious

00:17.460 --> 00:23.660
question. If rocks started out as flat sheets, how come nearly all the rocks I see today

00:23.660 --> 00:29.120
are lumpy and knobbly? To which the lecturer replied, are you sure you wouldn't be more

00:29.120 --> 00:34.340
comfortable on an arts course? But it was, I thought, a very good question. How do we

00:34.340 --> 00:42.080
get from this to this? And from this to this? Why are bits of trilobites, brachiopods and

00:42.080 --> 00:48.000
crinoids that lived at the bottom of the ocean now found on top of the Himalayas? And what

00:48.000 --> 00:55.440
the hell is going on here? In short, how did we make mountains out of sea mud? It took

00:55.440 --> 01:02.160
me three years to find out, but in this video I'll let you into the secret in just 23 minutes.

01:02.160 --> 01:06.480
By the end of the video, you'll be able to work it out for yourselves when you come across

01:06.480 --> 01:11.880
outcrops like these, so you can impress all your friends. Unless you've already got a

01:11.880 --> 01:17.760
geology degree, in which case you probably don't have any friends. Let's dispense with

01:17.760 --> 01:23.160
the rock that makes this kind of mountain first, because it's easy. It's a volcano.

01:23.160 --> 01:28.320
But no, you don't get any points for knowing that. This is made of another type of rock

01:28.320 --> 01:32.920
called igneous, which is molten rock that usually starts life in the hot zone of the

01:32.920 --> 01:39.380
Earth's mantle. Molten rock that pools below the surface cools quite slowly, and that means

01:39.380 --> 01:45.400
crystals have time to form, so the crystals are quite big. If the molten rock makes it

01:45.400 --> 01:51.580
all the way to the surface, it's called lava. Exposed to the air, it cools more quickly,

01:51.580 --> 01:56.900
so the crystals don't have much time to form, and as a result they're smaller. The fastest

01:56.900 --> 02:02.940
growing igneous rocks are those that emerge under water. They solidify so quickly that

02:02.940 --> 02:07.380
crystals on the outside barely have time to form, and you're sometimes left with a rock

02:07.380 --> 02:14.340
as fine as glass, called obsidian. Although technically it is a rock, obsidian does look

02:14.340 --> 02:19.900
like a mineral, so it gets mineralogists very excited, because they're a simple people attracted

02:19.900 --> 02:25.320
to shiny objects. These types of formations are called pillow lavas, and they're very

02:25.320 --> 02:31.100
easy to spot. Here they are under the sea around Hawaii, and here are some the Earth

02:31.100 --> 02:37.360
made earlier. So if you come across an igneous rock on a romantic stroll through the countryside,

02:37.360 --> 02:41.620
you can now impress your girlfriend by explaining how deeply you think the rock might have cooled

02:41.620 --> 02:46.740
and solidified based on its grain size, and you can go through the various classifications

02:46.740 --> 02:52.620
of igneous rocks in some detail, and if you find yourself walking home alone, you'll understand

02:52.620 --> 02:57.620
why geology students don't have girlfriends. By the way, the name of the rock not only

02:57.620 --> 03:03.100
depends on the size of the minerals, but also the type of minerals. That's why most geologists

03:03.100 --> 03:09.100
always carry a hand lens, along with the traditional hammer. One of my classmates was once asked

03:09.100 --> 03:14.020
by a lecturer what minerals were in one of the igneous rocks on a cliff face, and he

03:14.020 --> 03:20.260
said, don't know. The lecturer said, well, use your hand lens, man. After examining

03:20.260 --> 03:24.620
the rock for ten seconds through the hand lens, the student gave his verdict. Looks

03:24.620 --> 03:30.300
the same, only bigger. Ladies and gentlemen, this is the genius who would one day be entrusted

03:30.300 --> 03:36.620
with finding the oil that runs your car. Sometimes the molten lava contains a lot of gas, like

03:36.620 --> 03:43.520
steam and carbon dioxide, causing explosive eruptions. The lava is spat out so quickly,

03:43.520 --> 03:49.520
it turns into ash and small rock bombs. This may not look like molten rock, but you can

03:49.520 --> 03:56.000
see it better at night in the same volcano. These layers build up into the familiar steep

03:56.000 --> 04:02.160
conical shape of what are called composite volcanoes. The ash hardens over time to form

04:02.160 --> 04:08.880
a rock called tuff. Hence the well-known expression, it's tough at the top. When the lava is less

04:08.880 --> 04:14.360
gassy and explosive, as in Hawaii, it flows out along the landscape, making wider and

04:14.360 --> 04:20.680
flatter shield volcanoes. But most mountains aren't volcanoes, they're sedimentary rocks

04:20.680 --> 04:26.620
pushed up by tectonic forces, so that's what we'll look at in the rest of the video. To

04:26.620 --> 04:30.800
follow this process, let's start with the sedimentary material as it's moved around

04:30.800 --> 04:37.600
by currents and eventually falls to the seabed. As the environment changes over time, different

04:37.600 --> 04:43.640
metals, predominantly mud, silt, sand, calcium carbonate and bits of dead animals, are laid

04:43.640 --> 04:50.120
down one on top of the other. Over time, they harden and that all has to do with pressure

04:50.120 --> 04:56.720
and cementation that I won't go into here. Since sections of crust are constantly moving,

04:56.720 --> 05:00.840
eventually the piece of crust these hardened sediments are riding on will collide with

05:00.840 --> 05:06.380
another piece of crust. If you want to know how crustal plates move and collide, see my

05:06.380 --> 05:11.980
last educational video, The Story of the Earth in 33 Minutes.

05:11.980 --> 05:17.380
So what happens to the sedimentary layers? In this experiment, structural geologists,

05:17.380 --> 05:22.620
who don't like sleeping in tents, try to find out from the comfort of a warm, dry laboratory

05:22.620 --> 05:28.860
using layers of sand to represent rock strata. As one set of beds is pushed against the other,

05:28.860 --> 05:33.980
they're lifted up and begin to fold. As the pressure increases, the strata uplift and

05:33.980 --> 05:41.140
fold even more, sometimes to the point where the rocks that were underneath end up on top.

05:41.140 --> 05:46.820
These are called recumbent folds. And the purpose of recumbent folds is to confuse geology

05:46.820 --> 05:52.820
students who have to figure out why an older rock layer is lying on top of a younger one.

05:52.820 --> 05:58.220
Yes, that is me with all the hair. Being hairy is one of the entry requirements for a geology

05:58.220 --> 06:04.220
course, and when you graduate, you're given a beard. Even the women. Now, that's only

06:04.220 --> 06:10.180
a laboratory sand experiment, you might think. Rocks don't behave like that in the real world.

06:10.180 --> 06:16.220
But yes, they do. The great thing about lab experiments, apart from being warm and dry,

06:16.220 --> 06:22.340
is that if you get the materials right, you can recreate what we see in the real world.

06:22.340 --> 06:28.420
Water can also uplift rock strata by faulting, in other words, creating huge cracks. Now

06:28.420 --> 06:32.980
that the rocks have been uplifted, whether by faulting or folding, the mountains have

06:32.980 --> 06:39.620
to be further shaped by weathering and erosion. As rain falls, water finds its way across

06:39.620 --> 06:45.540
the rising sedimentary beds and into the low points and cracks. As the mountains rise higher,

06:45.540 --> 06:50.860
the channels cut deeper and the cracks get wider. Now they're beginning to look like

06:50.900 --> 06:57.060
proper mountains. Contrary to popular belief, it's not just one tiny river that carves all this.

06:57.060 --> 07:02.900
These river channels expose the rock face, but then it's other weathering forces that do most

07:02.900 --> 07:08.300
of the work in opening them up. Same goes for rock formations that aren't folded or faltered,

07:08.300 --> 07:15.500
just pushed up intact, and as flat as they were formed on the seabed. Erosion eats away at minor

07:15.580 --> 07:22.180
cracks, which get larger and eventually become chasms that separate and isolate large chunks

07:22.180 --> 07:28.500
of rock, known as outliers. You can see them in the North American desert. Eventually, the rock

07:28.500 --> 07:35.940
gets eroded to a pile of sand blowing across the landscape. So how does weathering work? First,

07:35.940 --> 07:40.780
there's chemical weathering, such as dissolved carbon dioxide from the air, mixing with water

07:40.860 --> 07:46.860
to make a weak acid. It dissolves the silicates and carbonates that make up most rock minerals.

07:46.860 --> 07:53.020
That's the weathering part. Then dissolved and broken rock is washed downwards, and the river

07:53.020 --> 07:59.260
carries them away. That's the erosion. Second, there's mechanical or physical weathering,

07:59.260 --> 08:06.060
like freeze and thaw, as water gets into cracks and crevices on the rock face. At night or during

08:06.060 --> 08:12.300
the winter, every time temperatures dip below zero, the water freezes and expands, cracking

08:12.300 --> 08:19.020
the rock. More water then comes into the larger crack, and when that freezes, it expands and the

08:19.020 --> 08:25.140
crack gets larger. Repeat this thousands of times and the crack gets larger and larger until the

08:25.140 --> 08:31.100
rock cracks apart. Closer to the tops of mountains, the ice never melts throughout the year,

08:31.100 --> 08:37.980
so the ice acts as a kind of glue, keeping loose rock permanently together. But thanks to global

08:37.980 --> 08:43.140
warming, the ice that held the rock together for millions of years is beginning to melt during the

08:43.140 --> 08:49.980
summer. The rocks become unglued and the result is dangerous landslides. A few years ago I went

08:49.980 --> 08:54.500
to Switzerland to do a story on how this is affecting the Alps, and while I was interviewing

08:54.500 --> 09:04.300
a local expert on this phenomenon, we were interrupted by just such an event. So the snow

09:04.300 --> 09:10.980
used to be around from November, around November to March, April. Now the snow doesn't begin until

09:10.980 --> 09:26.260
December and we're just getting a rockfall here. The other side of the valley, these rocks are just

09:26.260 --> 09:32.220
crashing down into the valley below from where the glacier has been. I don't think there could

09:32.220 --> 09:36.740
be a better example of how the glue that has held these rocks together and held that mountain

09:36.740 --> 09:45.940
together is now coming apart and the rocks are so loose they're just falling down. The science of

09:45.940 --> 09:52.300
mapping this tangle of tilting and folding rocks is called stratigraphy. Apart from the traditional

09:52.300 --> 09:58.500
hammer, the only equipment a stratigrapher needs is a compass, a clinometer and of course a carrot.

09:58.500 --> 10:04.740
Okay I know what you're thinking, what the hell is a clinometer? Well it's an instrument that

10:04.820 --> 10:11.340
measures the dipping angle of the rock strata. The hammer is there to expose fresh rock and it's true,

10:11.340 --> 10:16.780
we do lick these rocks when we break them open. It makes it easier to see the grain structure and

10:16.780 --> 10:23.060
identify the rock. Of course mineralogists do it because they like the taste. When I was a geology

10:23.060 --> 10:30.020
student we used to studiously examine rock outcrops. Okay this photo isn't showing that,

10:30.020 --> 10:40.780
but we did used to studiously examine rock outcrops. We used to studiously examine rock

10:40.780 --> 10:48.020
outcrops. Look this was a time when university education was free so we didn't have any student

10:48.020 --> 10:55.420
loans to worry about. Oh there it is. So we used to studiously examine the outcrop by bashing it

10:55.420 --> 11:02.180
to pieces with our hammers. One day the sedimentology lecturer admonished us. Don't just go straight in

11:02.180 --> 11:06.820
there and start hammering at the rock, he said, stand back. Look at how the surface has been

11:06.820 --> 11:12.300
withered. See if you can spot any cross bedding, graded bedding or unconformities. These are all

11:12.300 --> 11:20.580
clues. So the next day when we got to an outcrop we went in and this time we still started bashing

11:20.580 --> 11:26.420
it to pieces with our hammers because the truth is we just like bashing rocks. It's very satisfying

11:26.420 --> 11:31.300
when a layer of sediment that's been sitting untouched since it was laid down a hundred

11:31.300 --> 11:37.660
million years before dinosaurs came along and in the space of half a second is crushed under the

11:37.660 --> 11:44.020
hammer of an 18 year old with acne. But with hindsight our lecturer was right. I told you

11:44.020 --> 11:50.100
that on my first day I was mystified as to how flat beds on the sea floor turned into a chaotic

11:50.140 --> 11:58.220
jumble of rocks. But stand back, look closely and there are clues. You can still see the traces of

11:58.220 --> 12:03.700
the flat beds where the sediment was laid down even though the formation has been tilted and

12:03.700 --> 12:09.700
cracked. At the top of Mount Everest too you can still see the flat outline of the seabed laid down

12:09.700 --> 12:17.940
400 million years ago. Sometimes the clues are very obvious but usually most folds and faults

12:17.940 --> 12:24.100
stretch for miles under our feet so they can't be seen. This is what's underneath a 50 mile line

12:24.100 --> 12:30.300
across Greater London. It's the bottom of a fold, a sink line, which is why a river runs there and

12:30.300 --> 12:36.900
the river is why London is there. It just goes to show how much our lives are influenced by geology

12:36.900 --> 12:43.460
whether we know it or not. Stratigraphers need to build up a picture of what we can't see underneath

12:43.460 --> 12:49.860
our feet by looking at sparse and scattered outcrops that we can see. So they go off into

12:49.860 --> 12:54.820
the wilderness for months at a time armed only with the essential tools they need to make their

12:54.820 --> 13:01.460
measurements. A hammer, a compass, a clinometer and a carrot. What do you mean what's a carrot for?

13:01.460 --> 13:07.340
They've got to eat. They leave behind unnecessary and cumbersome equipment like polarizing

13:07.340 --> 13:14.220
microscopes and thin section cutters and a change of clothes and deodorant and when they come back

13:14.220 --> 13:19.340
to civilization they're locked away in dark basements where they process all that information.

13:20.140 --> 13:25.500
From the various outcrops they visited they plot the angle and direction of the dipping strata

13:25.500 --> 13:31.260
and from that they build up a picture of what's underneath. The result is beautiful geological

13:31.260 --> 13:37.260
columns and cross-sectional maps like these. Stratigraphers are the medieval monks of the

13:37.260 --> 13:43.020
geology world and not just because they're celibate for most of the year. Some rock types

13:43.020 --> 13:48.540
will baffle even the stratigraphers. The senior geologist I was working with in Australia told me

13:48.540 --> 13:53.740
about a stratigrapher who was out in the field and sent back some samples of what was obviously

13:53.740 --> 14:00.140
dunite with a note. Can you tell me what the pretty green rock is? The people who are experts

14:00.140 --> 14:05.420
at identifying rocks are called petrologists from the ancient Greek word petros, rock.

14:05.420 --> 14:12.140
The same word that gives us petroleum, rock oil. Now I have to tell you these people are fun fun

14:12.140 --> 14:17.980
fun. Just take a look at this hysterical joke from a petrology website and you'll see what I mean.

14:18.940 --> 14:24.780
Okay not all their jokes are as funny as that one but what they lack in quality they make up for in

14:24.780 --> 14:30.540
quantity. The reason petrologists have time to think of all these jokes is because they spend

14:30.540 --> 14:37.020
long hours looking at rocks and then more rocks and then other rocks. So they don't waste time

14:37.020 --> 14:43.340
doing the kind of frivolous things normal people do like going out. Anyway let's get back to

14:43.340 --> 14:49.180
weathering. There's a phenomenon called differential weathering which means rocks weather at different

14:49.180 --> 14:54.300
rates. You can see here the hard layers are protruding because the softer layers on top

14:54.300 --> 14:59.100
and below have been weathered more quickly. The material is different because of course

14:59.100 --> 15:05.340
the environment in which they were laid down changed over time. When hardened soft layers

15:05.340 --> 15:11.900
are tilted the same process can form hills. Even two layers of the same rock type can have different

15:11.900 --> 15:18.380
hardness. So the softer layer will erode faster and when it's underneath the harder layer that

15:18.380 --> 15:23.660
can leave us with features like these. Igneous rocks are the hardest of the lot.

15:24.620 --> 15:30.780
Remember that pool of magma I showed you earlier? Well it cools and solidifies into a hard large

15:30.780 --> 15:37.420
grained igneous rock usually granite so when the softer rocks around it are eroded the granite

15:37.420 --> 15:43.420
remains a prominent feature of the landscape called a massif. Now weathering patterns in one

15:43.420 --> 15:48.460
type of rock are so distinctive that even geology students can spot it from a distance.

15:49.500 --> 15:55.900
This is limestone calcium carbonate the stuff seashells are made of and calcium carbonate is

15:55.900 --> 16:02.780
a strong alkali so even a weak acid like co2 dissolved in water will eat it away very quickly.

16:03.740 --> 16:08.780
This is a model but it shows how limestone has a tendency to crack not only along its

16:08.780 --> 16:15.740
bedding planes but also at right angles to them forming blocks. So it's like the sandstone outlier

16:15.740 --> 16:22.620
process we saw earlier but on steroids. Acidic water seeps into cracks and dissolves them

16:22.620 --> 16:30.220
isolating and reducing the blocks. It forms what's called a cast landscape. The limestone

16:30.220 --> 16:36.620
also gets eaten away underground causing huge caves which sometimes flood when the water table

16:36.620 --> 16:42.380
rises. When these can no longer support the weight of rock above them they collapse forming

16:42.380 --> 16:49.180
sinkholes like the famous cenotes of Mexico. Because it's fine-grained and often made from

16:49.180 --> 16:55.100
fossilized sea creatures limestone can be a treasure trove of fossils a branch of geology

16:55.100 --> 17:01.580
called paleontology. Here we see a fashionable paleontologist in his typical working attire

17:01.580 --> 17:07.500
just off on a jaunt collecting fossils. You can look for fossils yourselves but it's not

17:07.500 --> 17:11.980
a good idea to take a paleontologist with you because when they find something interesting

17:11.980 --> 17:18.140
they tend to drool. Finally there's one last process shaping our mountains and it's the most

17:18.140 --> 17:26.620
recent. Over the last two million years the earth has been and still is in an ice age. During colder

17:26.620 --> 17:32.620
phases called glaciations ice sheets and glaciers advanced over much of the continents and as they

17:32.620 --> 17:40.060
moved they shaped the ground underneath. Think of a glacier as a slow-moving river of ice. Rocks that

17:40.060 --> 17:46.140
had shattered through freeze thaw fell into the glaciers. Rocks that were plucked from the ground

17:46.140 --> 17:51.740
were swept along and all were smoothed over thousands of years as they rubbed up against

17:51.740 --> 17:57.980
other rocks. They were dragged across in situ formations leaving scrape marks we can still see

17:57.980 --> 18:05.100
today called glacial scarring. V-shaped valleys were ground into u-shaped valleys by the rivers of ice.

18:05.980 --> 18:11.500
When the ice finally melted and the glaciers retreated the huge boulders they'd carried were

18:11.500 --> 18:19.180
left high and dry dumped on the landscape. They're called erratics. Now how can you tell the difference

18:19.180 --> 18:24.300
between a balancing rock that's an erratic from one that's been weathered? An outlier.

18:25.020 --> 18:30.620
Obviously the outlier is still attached at the base because it hasn't been moved. It's in situ.

18:31.580 --> 18:37.420
But there are other clues. Strata in a weathered rock will typically have the same dip and direction

18:37.420 --> 18:43.980
as the strata to which it's attached and it'll fit into the sequence. A glacial erratic is usually

18:43.980 --> 18:49.100
smoothed and made of a completely different material to the rock it sits on unattached.

18:50.060 --> 18:54.380
You can see the strata quite clearly in the famous balanced rock of Colorado Springs.

18:54.940 --> 19:01.260
It was formed nearly 300 million years ago from sand deposited at sea then lifted up with the

19:01.260 --> 19:08.540
Colorado mountains and weathered over millions of years by wind and rain. To get to this unique site

19:08.540 --> 19:14.140
involves a long hike through the eastern Rocky Mountains. At least it would except this is the

19:14.140 --> 19:20.220
United States so of course they made it into a drive-in. So the growth of mountains is a tug of

19:20.220 --> 19:26.780
war between uplift and erosion, the two great principles of geology. As the continents continue

19:26.780 --> 19:32.620
to collide today uplift in these regions is greater than erosion so mountain chains between

19:32.620 --> 19:39.180
them are still rising. Africa is still crashing into Europe, squeezing the Mediterranean and

19:39.180 --> 19:46.220
throwing up the Alps. India is still crashing into Asia and lifting the Himalayas. The higher

19:46.220 --> 19:52.700
these mountain chains go the faster they weather. Where the collisions have stopped the forces

19:52.700 --> 19:58.540
pushing these mountain ranges up are no longer operating so erosion takes over as the dominant

19:58.620 --> 20:04.300
force. The longer the period of tectonic inactivity has been the lower the mountains

20:04.300 --> 20:10.220
have been worn down. The Grampian Mountains in Scotland for example formed when North America

20:10.220 --> 20:16.220
crashed into Europe 450 million years ago and they were once as impressive as the Alps.

20:16.940 --> 20:22.620
Then the collisions stopped, erosion took over as the dominant force and most of the sedimentary

20:22.620 --> 20:28.780
rock has now been eroded away. All that's left are the igneous and metamorphic rocks

20:28.780 --> 20:34.940
that were once deep inside the mountain range. If you're a geomorphologist I bet you're getting

20:34.940 --> 20:40.700
very excited right now. If you think I've left a few things out from a three-year geology course

20:40.700 --> 20:48.780
in a 30-minute video you'd be absolutely right. I've left out about 2,624 and a half hours of

20:48.780 --> 20:54.700
material so I'm sure the comments section will be filled with things I supposedly forgot to mention.

20:55.420 --> 20:59.580
Thanks in advance but I haven't forgotten anything. I've just shown you a rough guide to

20:59.580 --> 21:04.700
the basics. If I've got anything wrong and you're watching this more than two days after the video

21:04.700 --> 21:10.540
was released it will already be in the corrections section of the video description so do check that

21:10.540 --> 21:16.380
please. And if you'd like to find out more well there's a wealth of information on the internet

21:16.380 --> 21:22.380
from online encyclopedias to universities schools and geological institutes with educational

21:22.380 --> 21:28.700
websites and all for free. You don't know how lucky you are to have all this information

21:28.700 --> 21:34.220
with just a few clicks of a search engine because when I was a student we had to scour the library

21:34.220 --> 21:40.220
to find what we needed. So of course in the internet age everyone is now learning from these

21:40.220 --> 21:46.300
sites and is better educated. Ah who am I kidding of course they aren't. People don't want to bother

21:46.300 --> 21:51.420
using the internet to find out how the earth really works. It's much more exciting to take

21:51.420 --> 21:57.580
lessons from bloggers and vloggers who say that the earth is expanding or it's hollow or it's flat

21:57.580 --> 22:02.860
rather than trying to understand any of that complicated math chemistry and geophysics that

22:02.860 --> 22:08.700
real geologists have to put up with. It's so much easier to imagine that a balancing rock on Mars

22:08.700 --> 22:13.820
was carved by martians and to save you the trouble of learning why a piece of coral is found on top

22:13.820 --> 22:18.620
of a mountain it's much easier to put the question on reddit and have people explain

22:18.620 --> 22:25.500
to you maybe someone carried it there. To those people I say by all means ignore the discoveries

22:25.500 --> 22:30.940
made by petrologists, mineralogists, stratigraphers and paleontologists who cut themselves off from

22:30.940 --> 22:36.460
the civilised world for most of the year and forego the comforts of life like bathing in

22:36.460 --> 22:41.660
order to find the oil that runs your car, the coal that powers your electricity, the iron ore that

22:41.660 --> 22:47.820
builds the bridges you drive over and the precious metals you need for your phone. Ignore their work

22:47.820 --> 22:53.580
and their sacrifice if you prefer to believe in martians but if you don't believe any of this

22:53.580 --> 22:59.900
geology stuff then stop running your car, your computer and your phone and don't go anywhere.

22:59.900 --> 23:05.740
See what life would be like without them. To the others who've made it this far and who are

23:05.740 --> 23:13.180
interested in the real world I hope this video has been useful. Wait don't go yet! I don't ask

23:13.180 --> 23:18.380
for contributions for my channel and I don't make any money out of my videos so if you like the

23:18.380 --> 23:23.900
video and want to contribute something I always request that you send the money to this charity

23:23.900 --> 23:29.740
instead. It's an innovative scheme that offers subsidised medical care to poor people who live

23:29.740 --> 23:35.500
in or near forests in exchange for not cutting down the trees because the reason they cut down

23:35.500 --> 23:40.940
the trees in the past was because they needed cash urgently when members of the family were sick.

23:41.740 --> 23:46.220
The scheme has been so successful that studies have been written about it and found that people

23:46.220 --> 23:51.740
in the areas where it's operating are healthier and illegal logging has been drastically reduced.

23:52.460 --> 23:59.820
So far donations in my name from subscribers to this channel have reached $270,000 and that's

23:59.820 --> 24:05.580
helped expand the scheme from Indonesia to Madagascar and Brazil. So if you've always

24:05.580 --> 24:11.180
faced the dilemma of whether you should donate money to help poor people or save the forests,

24:11.180 --> 24:14.940
well now you can do both. Details are in the video description.
