00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,140
When I started my geology course at university many years ago I learnt something extraordinary

2
00:00:05,140 --> 00:00:11,140
on the very first day. Most of the rocks we see around us started life as flat beds laid

3
00:00:11,140 --> 00:00:17,460
down at the bottom of the sea. I was shocked, so I put my hand up and asked the obvious

4
00:00:17,460 --> 00:00:23,660
question. If rocks started out as flat sheets, how come nearly all the rocks I see today

5
00:00:23,660 --> 00:00:29,120
are lumpy and knobbly? To which the lecturer replied, are you sure you wouldn't be more

6
00:00:29,120 --> 00:00:34,340
comfortable on an arts course? But it was, I thought, a very good question. How do we

7
00:00:34,340 --> 00:00:42,080
get from this to this? And from this to this? Why are bits of trilobites, brachiopods and

8
00:00:42,080 --> 00:00:48,000
crinoids that lived at the bottom of the ocean now found on top of the Himalayas? And what

9
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:55,440
the hell is going on here? In short, how did we make mountains out of sea mud? It took

10
00:00:55,440 --> 00:01:02,160
me three years to find out, but in this video I'll let you into the secret in just 23 minutes.

11
00:01:02,160 --> 00:01:06,480
By the end of the video, you'll be able to work it out for yourselves when you come across

12
00:01:06,480 --> 00:01:11,880
outcrops like these, so you can impress all your friends. Unless you've already got a

13
00:01:11,880 --> 00:01:17,760
geology degree, in which case you probably don't have any friends. Let's dispense with

14
00:01:17,760 --> 00:01:23,160
the rock that makes this kind of mountain first, because it's easy. It's a volcano.

15
00:01:23,160 --> 00:01:28,320
But no, you don't get any points for knowing that. This is made of another type of rock

16
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:32,920
called igneous, which is molten rock that usually starts life in the hot zone of the

17
00:01:32,920 --> 00:01:39,380
Earth's mantle. Molten rock that pools below the surface cools quite slowly, and that means

18
00:01:39,380 --> 00:01:45,400
crystals have time to form, so the crystals are quite big. If the molten rock makes it

19
00:01:45,400 --> 00:01:51,580
all the way to the surface, it's called lava. Exposed to the air, it cools more quickly,

20
00:01:51,580 --> 00:01:56,900
so the crystals don't have much time to form, and as a result they're smaller. The fastest

21
00:01:56,900 --> 00:02:02,940
growing igneous rocks are those that emerge under water. They solidify so quickly that

22
00:02:02,940 --> 00:02:07,380
crystals on the outside barely have time to form, and you're sometimes left with a rock

23
00:02:07,380 --> 00:02:14,340
as fine as glass, called obsidian. Although technically it is a rock, obsidian does look

24
00:02:14,340 --> 00:02:19,900
like a mineral, so it gets mineralogists very excited, because they're a simple people attracted

25
00:02:19,900 --> 00:02:25,320
to shiny objects. These types of formations are called pillow lavas, and they're very

26
00:02:25,320 --> 00:02:31,100
easy to spot. Here they are under the sea around Hawaii, and here are some the Earth

27
00:02:31,100 --> 00:02:37,360
made earlier. So if you come across an igneous rock on a romantic stroll through the countryside,

28
00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:41,620
you can now impress your girlfriend by explaining how deeply you think the rock might have cooled

29
00:02:41,620 --> 00:02:46,740
and solidified based on its grain size, and you can go through the various classifications

30
00:02:46,740 --> 00:02:52,620
of igneous rocks in some detail, and if you find yourself walking home alone, you'll understand

31
00:02:52,620 --> 00:02:57,620
why geology students don't have girlfriends. By the way, the name of the rock not only

32
00:02:57,620 --> 00:03:03,100
depends on the size of the minerals, but also the type of minerals. That's why most geologists

33
00:03:03,100 --> 00:03:09,100
always carry a hand lens, along with the traditional hammer. One of my classmates was once asked

34
00:03:09,100 --> 00:03:14,020
by a lecturer what minerals were in one of the igneous rocks on a cliff face, and he

35
00:03:14,020 --> 00:03:20,260
said, don't know. The lecturer said, well, use your hand lens, man. After examining

36
00:03:20,260 --> 00:03:24,620
the rock for ten seconds through the hand lens, the student gave his verdict. Looks

37
00:03:24,620 --> 00:03:30,300
the same, only bigger. Ladies and gentlemen, this is the genius who would one day be entrusted

38
00:03:30,300 --> 00:03:36,620
with finding the oil that runs your car. Sometimes the molten lava contains a lot of gas, like

39
00:03:36,620 --> 00:03:43,520
steam and carbon dioxide, causing explosive eruptions. The lava is spat out so quickly,

40
00:03:43,520 --> 00:03:49,520
it turns into ash and small rock bombs. This may not look like molten rock, but you can

41
00:03:49,520 --> 00:03:56,000
see it better at night in the same volcano. These layers build up into the familiar steep

42
00:03:56,000 --> 00:04:02,160
conical shape of what are called composite volcanoes. The ash hardens over time to form

43
00:04:02,160 --> 00:04:08,880
a rock called tuff. Hence the well-known expression, it's tough at the top. When the lava is less

44
00:04:08,880 --> 00:04:14,360
gassy and explosive, as in Hawaii, it flows out along the landscape, making wider and

45
00:04:14,360 --> 00:04:20,680
flatter shield volcanoes. But most mountains aren't volcanoes, they're sedimentary rocks

46
00:04:20,680 --> 00:04:26,620
pushed up by tectonic forces, so that's what we'll look at in the rest of the video. To

47
00:04:26,620 --> 00:04:30,800
follow this process, let's start with the sedimentary material as it's moved around

48
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:37,600
by currents and eventually falls to the seabed. As the environment changes over time, different

49
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:43,640
metals, predominantly mud, silt, sand, calcium carbonate and bits of dead animals, are laid

50
00:04:43,640 --> 00:04:50,120
down one on top of the other. Over time, they harden and that all has to do with pressure

51
00:04:50,120 --> 00:04:56,720
and cementation that I won't go into here. Since sections of crust are constantly moving,

52
00:04:56,720 --> 00:05:00,840
eventually the piece of crust these hardened sediments are riding on will collide with

53
00:05:00,840 --> 00:05:06,380
another piece of crust. If you want to know how crustal plates move and collide, see my

54
00:05:06,380 --> 00:05:11,980
last educational video, The Story of the Earth in 33 Minutes.

55
00:05:11,980 --> 00:05:17,380
So what happens to the sedimentary layers? In this experiment, structural geologists,

56
00:05:17,380 --> 00:05:22,620
who don't like sleeping in tents, try to find out from the comfort of a warm, dry laboratory

57
00:05:22,620 --> 00:05:28,860
using layers of sand to represent rock strata. As one set of beds is pushed against the other,

58
00:05:28,860 --> 00:05:33,980
they're lifted up and begin to fold. As the pressure increases, the strata uplift and

59
00:05:33,980 --> 00:05:41,140
fold even more, sometimes to the point where the rocks that were underneath end up on top.

60
00:05:41,140 --> 00:05:46,820
These are called recumbent folds. And the purpose of recumbent folds is to confuse geology

61
00:05:46,820 --> 00:05:52,820
students who have to figure out why an older rock layer is lying on top of a younger one.

62
00:05:52,820 --> 00:05:58,220
Yes, that is me with all the hair. Being hairy is one of the entry requirements for a geology

63
00:05:58,220 --> 00:06:04,220
course, and when you graduate, you're given a beard. Even the women. Now, that's only

64
00:06:04,220 --> 00:06:10,180
a laboratory sand experiment, you might think. Rocks don't behave like that in the real world.

65
00:06:10,180 --> 00:06:16,220
But yes, they do. The great thing about lab experiments, apart from being warm and dry,

66
00:06:16,220 --> 00:06:22,340
is that if you get the materials right, you can recreate what we see in the real world.

67
00:06:22,340 --> 00:06:28,420
Water can also uplift rock strata by faulting, in other words, creating huge cracks. Now

68
00:06:28,420 --> 00:06:32,980
that the rocks have been uplifted, whether by faulting or folding, the mountains have

69
00:06:32,980 --> 00:06:39,620
to be further shaped by weathering and erosion. As rain falls, water finds its way across

70
00:06:39,620 --> 00:06:45,540
the rising sedimentary beds and into the low points and cracks. As the mountains rise higher,

71
00:06:45,540 --> 00:06:50,860
the channels cut deeper and the cracks get wider. Now they're beginning to look like

72
00:06:50,900 --> 00:06:57,060
proper mountains. Contrary to popular belief, it's not just one tiny river that carves all this.

73
00:06:57,060 --> 00:07:02,900
These river channels expose the rock face, but then it's other weathering forces that do most

74
00:07:02,900 --> 00:07:08,300
of the work in opening them up. Same goes for rock formations that aren't folded or faltered,

75
00:07:08,300 --> 00:07:15,500
just pushed up intact, and as flat as they were formed on the seabed. Erosion eats away at minor

76
00:07:15,580 --> 00:07:22,180
cracks, which get larger and eventually become chasms that separate and isolate large chunks

77
00:07:22,180 --> 00:07:28,500
of rock, known as outliers. You can see them in the North American desert. Eventually, the rock

78
00:07:28,500 --> 00:07:35,940
gets eroded to a pile of sand blowing across the landscape. So how does weathering work? First,

79
00:07:35,940 --> 00:07:40,780
there's chemical weathering, such as dissolved carbon dioxide from the air, mixing with water

80
00:07:40,860 --> 00:07:46,860
to make a weak acid. It dissolves the silicates and carbonates that make up most rock minerals.

81
00:07:46,860 --> 00:07:53,020
That's the weathering part. Then dissolved and broken rock is washed downwards, and the river

82
00:07:53,020 --> 00:07:59,260
carries them away. That's the erosion. Second, there's mechanical or physical weathering,

83
00:07:59,260 --> 00:08:06,060
like freeze and thaw, as water gets into cracks and crevices on the rock face. At night or during

84
00:08:06,060 --> 00:08:12,300
the winter, every time temperatures dip below zero, the water freezes and expands, cracking

85
00:08:12,300 --> 00:08:19,020
the rock. More water then comes into the larger crack, and when that freezes, it expands and the

86
00:08:19,020 --> 00:08:25,140
crack gets larger. Repeat this thousands of times and the crack gets larger and larger until the

87
00:08:25,140 --> 00:08:31,100
rock cracks apart. Closer to the tops of mountains, the ice never melts throughout the year,

88
00:08:31,100 --> 00:08:37,980
so the ice acts as a kind of glue, keeping loose rock permanently together. But thanks to global

89
00:08:37,980 --> 00:08:43,140
warming, the ice that held the rock together for millions of years is beginning to melt during the

90
00:08:43,140 --> 00:08:49,980
summer. The rocks become unglued and the result is dangerous landslides. A few years ago I went

91
00:08:49,980 --> 00:08:54,500
to Switzerland to do a story on how this is affecting the Alps, and while I was interviewing

92
00:08:54,500 --> 00:09:04,300
a local expert on this phenomenon, we were interrupted by just such an event. So the snow

93
00:09:04,300 --> 00:09:10,980
used to be around from November, around November to March, April. Now the snow doesn't begin until

94
00:09:10,980 --> 00:09:26,260
December and we're just getting a rockfall here. The other side of the valley, these rocks are just

95
00:09:26,260 --> 00:09:32,220
crashing down into the valley below from where the glacier has been. I don't think there could

96
00:09:32,220 --> 00:09:36,740
be a better example of how the glue that has held these rocks together and held that mountain

97
00:09:36,740 --> 00:09:45,940
together is now coming apart and the rocks are so loose they're just falling down. The science of

98
00:09:45,940 --> 00:09:52,300
mapping this tangle of tilting and folding rocks is called stratigraphy. Apart from the traditional

99
00:09:52,300 --> 00:09:58,500
hammer, the only equipment a stratigrapher needs is a compass, a clinometer and of course a carrot.

100
00:09:58,500 --> 00:10:04,740
Okay I know what you're thinking, what the hell is a clinometer? Well it's an instrument that

101
00:10:04,820 --> 00:10:11,340
measures the dipping angle of the rock strata. The hammer is there to expose fresh rock and it's true,

102
00:10:11,340 --> 00:10:16,780
we do lick these rocks when we break them open. It makes it easier to see the grain structure and

103
00:10:16,780 --> 00:10:23,060
identify the rock. Of course mineralogists do it because they like the taste. When I was a geology

104
00:10:23,060 --> 00:10:30,020
student we used to studiously examine rock outcrops. Okay this photo isn't showing that,

105
00:10:30,020 --> 00:10:40,780
but we did used to studiously examine rock outcrops. We used to studiously examine rock

106
00:10:40,780 --> 00:10:48,020
outcrops. Look this was a time when university education was free so we didn't have any student

107
00:10:48,020 --> 00:10:55,420
loans to worry about. Oh there it is. So we used to studiously examine the outcrop by bashing it

108
00:10:55,420 --> 00:11:02,180
to pieces with our hammers. One day the sedimentology lecturer admonished us. Don't just go straight in

109
00:11:02,180 --> 00:11:06,820
there and start hammering at the rock, he said, stand back. Look at how the surface has been

110
00:11:06,820 --> 00:11:12,300
withered. See if you can spot any cross bedding, graded bedding or unconformities. These are all

111
00:11:12,300 --> 00:11:20,580
clues. So the next day when we got to an outcrop we went in and this time we still started bashing

112
00:11:20,580 --> 00:11:26,420
it to pieces with our hammers because the truth is we just like bashing rocks. It's very satisfying

113
00:11:26,420 --> 00:11:31,300
when a layer of sediment that's been sitting untouched since it was laid down a hundred

114
00:11:31,300 --> 00:11:37,660
million years before dinosaurs came along and in the space of half a second is crushed under the

115
00:11:37,660 --> 00:11:44,020
hammer of an 18 year old with acne. But with hindsight our lecturer was right. I told you

116
00:11:44,020 --> 00:11:50,100
that on my first day I was mystified as to how flat beds on the sea floor turned into a chaotic

117
00:11:50,140 --> 00:11:58,220
jumble of rocks. But stand back, look closely and there are clues. You can still see the traces of

118
00:11:58,220 --> 00:12:03,700
the flat beds where the sediment was laid down even though the formation has been tilted and

119
00:12:03,700 --> 00:12:09,700
cracked. At the top of Mount Everest too you can still see the flat outline of the seabed laid down

120
00:12:09,700 --> 00:12:17,940
400 million years ago. Sometimes the clues are very obvious but usually most folds and faults

121
00:12:17,940 --> 00:12:24,100
stretch for miles under our feet so they can't be seen. This is what's underneath a 50 mile line

122
00:12:24,100 --> 00:12:30,300
across Greater London. It's the bottom of a fold, a sink line, which is why a river runs there and

123
00:12:30,300 --> 00:12:36,900
the river is why London is there. It just goes to show how much our lives are influenced by geology

124
00:12:36,900 --> 00:12:43,460
whether we know it or not. Stratigraphers need to build up a picture of what we can't see underneath

125
00:12:43,460 --> 00:12:49,860
our feet by looking at sparse and scattered outcrops that we can see. So they go off into

126
00:12:49,860 --> 00:12:54,820
the wilderness for months at a time armed only with the essential tools they need to make their

127
00:12:54,820 --> 00:13:01,460
measurements. A hammer, a compass, a clinometer and a carrot. What do you mean what's a carrot for?

128
00:13:01,460 --> 00:13:07,340
They've got to eat. They leave behind unnecessary and cumbersome equipment like polarizing

129
00:13:07,340 --> 00:13:14,220
microscopes and thin section cutters and a change of clothes and deodorant and when they come back

130
00:13:14,220 --> 00:13:19,340
to civilization they're locked away in dark basements where they process all that information.

131
00:13:20,140 --> 00:13:25,500
From the various outcrops they visited they plot the angle and direction of the dipping strata

132
00:13:25,500 --> 00:13:31,260
and from that they build up a picture of what's underneath. The result is beautiful geological

133
00:13:31,260 --> 00:13:37,260
columns and cross-sectional maps like these. Stratigraphers are the medieval monks of the

134
00:13:37,260 --> 00:13:43,020
geology world and not just because they're celibate for most of the year. Some rock types

135
00:13:43,020 --> 00:13:48,540
will baffle even the stratigraphers. The senior geologist I was working with in Australia told me

136
00:13:48,540 --> 00:13:53,740
about a stratigrapher who was out in the field and sent back some samples of what was obviously

137
00:13:53,740 --> 00:14:00,140
dunite with a note. Can you tell me what the pretty green rock is? The people who are experts

138
00:14:00,140 --> 00:14:05,420
at identifying rocks are called petrologists from the ancient Greek word petros, rock.

139
00:14:05,420 --> 00:14:12,140
The same word that gives us petroleum, rock oil. Now I have to tell you these people are fun fun

140
00:14:12,140 --> 00:14:17,980
fun. Just take a look at this hysterical joke from a petrology website and you'll see what I mean.

141
00:14:18,940 --> 00:14:24,780
Okay not all their jokes are as funny as that one but what they lack in quality they make up for in

142
00:14:24,780 --> 00:14:30,540
quantity. The reason petrologists have time to think of all these jokes is because they spend

143
00:14:30,540 --> 00:14:37,020
long hours looking at rocks and then more rocks and then other rocks. So they don't waste time

144
00:14:37,020 --> 00:14:43,340
doing the kind of frivolous things normal people do like going out. Anyway let's get back to

145
00:14:43,340 --> 00:14:49,180
weathering. There's a phenomenon called differential weathering which means rocks weather at different

146
00:14:49,180 --> 00:14:54,300
rates. You can see here the hard layers are protruding because the softer layers on top

147
00:14:54,300 --> 00:14:59,100
and below have been weathered more quickly. The material is different because of course

148
00:14:59,100 --> 00:15:05,340
the environment in which they were laid down changed over time. When hardened soft layers

149
00:15:05,340 --> 00:15:11,900
are tilted the same process can form hills. Even two layers of the same rock type can have different

150
00:15:11,900 --> 00:15:18,380
hardness. So the softer layer will erode faster and when it's underneath the harder layer that

151
00:15:18,380 --> 00:15:23,660
can leave us with features like these. Igneous rocks are the hardest of the lot.

152
00:15:24,620 --> 00:15:30,780
Remember that pool of magma I showed you earlier? Well it cools and solidifies into a hard large

153
00:15:30,780 --> 00:15:37,420
grained igneous rock usually granite so when the softer rocks around it are eroded the granite

154
00:15:37,420 --> 00:15:43,420
remains a prominent feature of the landscape called a massif. Now weathering patterns in one

155
00:15:43,420 --> 00:15:48,460
type of rock are so distinctive that even geology students can spot it from a distance.

156
00:15:49,500 --> 00:15:55,900
This is limestone calcium carbonate the stuff seashells are made of and calcium carbonate is

157
00:15:55,900 --> 00:16:02,780
a strong alkali so even a weak acid like co2 dissolved in water will eat it away very quickly.

158
00:16:03,740 --> 00:16:08,780
This is a model but it shows how limestone has a tendency to crack not only along its

159
00:16:08,780 --> 00:16:15,740
bedding planes but also at right angles to them forming blocks. So it's like the sandstone outlier

160
00:16:15,740 --> 00:16:22,620
process we saw earlier but on steroids. Acidic water seeps into cracks and dissolves them

161
00:16:22,620 --> 00:16:30,220
isolating and reducing the blocks. It forms what's called a cast landscape. The limestone

162
00:16:30,220 --> 00:16:36,620
also gets eaten away underground causing huge caves which sometimes flood when the water table

163
00:16:36,620 --> 00:16:42,380
rises. When these can no longer support the weight of rock above them they collapse forming

164
00:16:42,380 --> 00:16:49,180
sinkholes like the famous cenotes of Mexico. Because it's fine-grained and often made from

165
00:16:49,180 --> 00:16:55,100
fossilized sea creatures limestone can be a treasure trove of fossils a branch of geology

166
00:16:55,100 --> 00:17:01,580
called paleontology. Here we see a fashionable paleontologist in his typical working attire

167
00:17:01,580 --> 00:17:07,500
just off on a jaunt collecting fossils. You can look for fossils yourselves but it's not

168
00:17:07,500 --> 00:17:11,980
a good idea to take a paleontologist with you because when they find something interesting

169
00:17:11,980 --> 00:17:18,140
they tend to drool. Finally there's one last process shaping our mountains and it's the most

170
00:17:18,140 --> 00:17:26,620
recent. Over the last two million years the earth has been and still is in an ice age. During colder

171
00:17:26,620 --> 00:17:32,620
phases called glaciations ice sheets and glaciers advanced over much of the continents and as they

172
00:17:32,620 --> 00:17:40,060
moved they shaped the ground underneath. Think of a glacier as a slow-moving river of ice. Rocks that

173
00:17:40,060 --> 00:17:46,140
had shattered through freeze thaw fell into the glaciers. Rocks that were plucked from the ground

174
00:17:46,140 --> 00:17:51,740
were swept along and all were smoothed over thousands of years as they rubbed up against

175
00:17:51,740 --> 00:17:57,980
other rocks. They were dragged across in situ formations leaving scrape marks we can still see

176
00:17:57,980 --> 00:18:05,100
today called glacial scarring. V-shaped valleys were ground into u-shaped valleys by the rivers of ice.

177
00:18:05,980 --> 00:18:11,500
When the ice finally melted and the glaciers retreated the huge boulders they'd carried were

178
00:18:11,500 --> 00:18:19,180
left high and dry dumped on the landscape. They're called erratics. Now how can you tell the difference

179
00:18:19,180 --> 00:18:24,300
between a balancing rock that's an erratic from one that's been weathered? An outlier.

180
00:18:25,020 --> 00:18:30,620
Obviously the outlier is still attached at the base because it hasn't been moved. It's in situ.

181
00:18:31,580 --> 00:18:37,420
But there are other clues. Strata in a weathered rock will typically have the same dip and direction

182
00:18:37,420 --> 00:18:43,980
as the strata to which it's attached and it'll fit into the sequence. A glacial erratic is usually

183
00:18:43,980 --> 00:18:49,100
smoothed and made of a completely different material to the rock it sits on unattached.

184
00:18:50,060 --> 00:18:54,380
You can see the strata quite clearly in the famous balanced rock of Colorado Springs.

185
00:18:54,940 --> 00:19:01,260
It was formed nearly 300 million years ago from sand deposited at sea then lifted up with the

186
00:19:01,260 --> 00:19:08,540
Colorado mountains and weathered over millions of years by wind and rain. To get to this unique site

187
00:19:08,540 --> 00:19:14,140
involves a long hike through the eastern Rocky Mountains. At least it would except this is the

188
00:19:14,140 --> 00:19:20,220
United States so of course they made it into a drive-in. So the growth of mountains is a tug of

189
00:19:20,220 --> 00:19:26,780
war between uplift and erosion, the two great principles of geology. As the continents continue

190
00:19:26,780 --> 00:19:32,620
to collide today uplift in these regions is greater than erosion so mountain chains between

191
00:19:32,620 --> 00:19:39,180
them are still rising. Africa is still crashing into Europe, squeezing the Mediterranean and

192
00:19:39,180 --> 00:19:46,220
throwing up the Alps. India is still crashing into Asia and lifting the Himalayas. The higher

193
00:19:46,220 --> 00:19:52,700
these mountain chains go the faster they weather. Where the collisions have stopped the forces

194
00:19:52,700 --> 00:19:58,540
pushing these mountain ranges up are no longer operating so erosion takes over as the dominant

195
00:19:58,620 --> 00:20:04,300
force. The longer the period of tectonic inactivity has been the lower the mountains

196
00:20:04,300 --> 00:20:10,220
have been worn down. The Grampian Mountains in Scotland for example formed when North America

197
00:20:10,220 --> 00:20:16,220
crashed into Europe 450 million years ago and they were once as impressive as the Alps.

198
00:20:16,940 --> 00:20:22,620
Then the collisions stopped, erosion took over as the dominant force and most of the sedimentary

199
00:20:22,620 --> 00:20:28,780
rock has now been eroded away. All that's left are the igneous and metamorphic rocks

200
00:20:28,780 --> 00:20:34,940
that were once deep inside the mountain range. If you're a geomorphologist I bet you're getting

201
00:20:34,940 --> 00:20:40,700
very excited right now. If you think I've left a few things out from a three-year geology course

202
00:20:40,700 --> 00:20:48,780
in a 30-minute video you'd be absolutely right. I've left out about 2,624 and a half hours of

203
00:20:48,780 --> 00:20:54,700
material so I'm sure the comments section will be filled with things I supposedly forgot to mention.

204
00:20:55,420 --> 00:20:59,580
Thanks in advance but I haven't forgotten anything. I've just shown you a rough guide to

205
00:20:59,580 --> 00:21:04,700
the basics. If I've got anything wrong and you're watching this more than two days after the video

206
00:21:04,700 --> 00:21:10,540
was released it will already be in the corrections section of the video description so do check that

207
00:21:10,540 --> 00:21:16,380
please. And if you'd like to find out more well there's a wealth of information on the internet

208
00:21:16,380 --> 00:21:22,380
from online encyclopedias to universities schools and geological institutes with educational

209
00:21:22,380 --> 00:21:28,700
websites and all for free. You don't know how lucky you are to have all this information

210
00:21:28,700 --> 00:21:34,220
with just a few clicks of a search engine because when I was a student we had to scour the library

211
00:21:34,220 --> 00:21:40,220
to find what we needed. So of course in the internet age everyone is now learning from these

212
00:21:40,220 --> 00:21:46,300
sites and is better educated. Ah who am I kidding of course they aren't. People don't want to bother

213
00:21:46,300 --> 00:21:51,420
using the internet to find out how the earth really works. It's much more exciting to take

214
00:21:51,420 --> 00:21:57,580
lessons from bloggers and vloggers who say that the earth is expanding or it's hollow or it's flat

215
00:21:57,580 --> 00:22:02,860
rather than trying to understand any of that complicated math chemistry and geophysics that

216
00:22:02,860 --> 00:22:08,700
real geologists have to put up with. It's so much easier to imagine that a balancing rock on Mars

217
00:22:08,700 --> 00:22:13,820
was carved by martians and to save you the trouble of learning why a piece of coral is found on top

218
00:22:13,820 --> 00:22:18,620
of a mountain it's much easier to put the question on reddit and have people explain

219
00:22:18,620 --> 00:22:25,500
to you maybe someone carried it there. To those people I say by all means ignore the discoveries

220
00:22:25,500 --> 00:22:30,940
made by petrologists, mineralogists, stratigraphers and paleontologists who cut themselves off from

221
00:22:30,940 --> 00:22:36,460
the civilised world for most of the year and forego the comforts of life like bathing in

222
00:22:36,460 --> 00:22:41,660
order to find the oil that runs your car, the coal that powers your electricity, the iron ore that

223
00:22:41,660 --> 00:22:47,820
builds the bridges you drive over and the precious metals you need for your phone. Ignore their work

224
00:22:47,820 --> 00:22:53,580
and their sacrifice if you prefer to believe in martians but if you don't believe any of this

225
00:22:53,580 --> 00:22:59,900
geology stuff then stop running your car, your computer and your phone and don't go anywhere.

226
00:22:59,900 --> 00:23:05,740
See what life would be like without them. To the others who've made it this far and who are

227
00:23:05,740 --> 00:23:13,180
interested in the real world I hope this video has been useful. Wait don't go yet! I don't ask

228
00:23:13,180 --> 00:23:18,380
for contributions for my channel and I don't make any money out of my videos so if you like the

229
00:23:18,380 --> 00:23:23,900
video and want to contribute something I always request that you send the money to this charity

230
00:23:23,900 --> 00:23:29,740
instead. It's an innovative scheme that offers subsidised medical care to poor people who live

231
00:23:29,740 --> 00:23:35,500
in or near forests in exchange for not cutting down the trees because the reason they cut down

232
00:23:35,500 --> 00:23:40,940
the trees in the past was because they needed cash urgently when members of the family were sick.

233
00:23:41,740 --> 00:23:46,220
The scheme has been so successful that studies have been written about it and found that people

234
00:23:46,220 --> 00:23:51,740
in the areas where it's operating are healthier and illegal logging has been drastically reduced.

235
00:23:52,460 --> 00:23:59,820
So far donations in my name from subscribers to this channel have reached $270,000 and that's

236
00:23:59,820 --> 00:24:05,580
helped expand the scheme from Indonesia to Madagascar and Brazil. So if you've always

237
00:24:05,580 --> 00:24:11,180
faced the dilemma of whether you should donate money to help poor people or save the forests,

238
00:24:11,180 --> 00:24:14,940
well now you can do both. Details are in the video description.
