0	5140	When I started my geology course at university many years ago I learnt something extraordinary
5140	11140	on the very first day. Most of the rocks we see around us started life as flat beds laid
11140	17460	down at the bottom of the sea. I was shocked, so I put my hand up and asked the obvious
17460	23660	question. If rocks started out as flat sheets, how come nearly all the rocks I see today
23660	29120	are lumpy and knobbly? To which the lecturer replied, are you sure you wouldn't be more
29120	34340	comfortable on an arts course? But it was, I thought, a very good question. How do we
34340	42080	get from this to this? And from this to this? Why are bits of trilobites, brachiopods and
42080	48000	crinoids that lived at the bottom of the ocean now found on top of the Himalayas? And what
48000	55440	the hell is going on here? In short, how did we make mountains out of sea mud? It took
55440	62160	me three years to find out, but in this video I'll let you into the secret in just 23 minutes.
62160	66480	By the end of the video, you'll be able to work it out for yourselves when you come across
66480	71880	outcrops like these, so you can impress all your friends. Unless you've already got a
71880	77760	geology degree, in which case you probably don't have any friends. Let's dispense with
77760	83160	the rock that makes this kind of mountain first, because it's easy. It's a volcano.
83160	88320	But no, you don't get any points for knowing that. This is made of another type of rock
88320	92920	called igneous, which is molten rock that usually starts life in the hot zone of the
92920	99380	Earth's mantle. Molten rock that pools below the surface cools quite slowly, and that means
99380	105400	crystals have time to form, so the crystals are quite big. If the molten rock makes it
105400	111580	all the way to the surface, it's called lava. Exposed to the air, it cools more quickly,
111580	116900	so the crystals don't have much time to form, and as a result they're smaller. The fastest
116900	122940	growing igneous rocks are those that emerge under water. They solidify so quickly that
122940	127380	crystals on the outside barely have time to form, and you're sometimes left with a rock
127380	134340	as fine as glass, called obsidian. Although technically it is a rock, obsidian does look
134340	139900	like a mineral, so it gets mineralogists very excited, because they're a simple people attracted
139900	145320	to shiny objects. These types of formations are called pillow lavas, and they're very
145320	151100	easy to spot. Here they are under the sea around Hawaii, and here are some the Earth
151100	157360	made earlier. So if you come across an igneous rock on a romantic stroll through the countryside,
157360	161620	you can now impress your girlfriend by explaining how deeply you think the rock might have cooled
161620	166740	and solidified based on its grain size, and you can go through the various classifications
166740	172620	of igneous rocks in some detail, and if you find yourself walking home alone, you'll understand
172620	177620	why geology students don't have girlfriends. By the way, the name of the rock not only
177620	183100	depends on the size of the minerals, but also the type of minerals. That's why most geologists
183100	189100	always carry a hand lens, along with the traditional hammer. One of my classmates was once asked
189100	194020	by a lecturer what minerals were in one of the igneous rocks on a cliff face, and he
194020	200260	said, don't know. The lecturer said, well, use your hand lens, man. After examining
200260	204620	the rock for ten seconds through the hand lens, the student gave his verdict. Looks
204620	210300	the same, only bigger. Ladies and gentlemen, this is the genius who would one day be entrusted
210300	216620	with finding the oil that runs your car. Sometimes the molten lava contains a lot of gas, like
216620	223520	steam and carbon dioxide, causing explosive eruptions. The lava is spat out so quickly,
223520	229520	it turns into ash and small rock bombs. This may not look like molten rock, but you can
229520	236000	see it better at night in the same volcano. These layers build up into the familiar steep
236000	242160	conical shape of what are called composite volcanoes. The ash hardens over time to form
242160	248880	a rock called tuff. Hence the well-known expression, it's tough at the top. When the lava is less
248880	254360	gassy and explosive, as in Hawaii, it flows out along the landscape, making wider and
254360	260680	flatter shield volcanoes. But most mountains aren't volcanoes, they're sedimentary rocks
260680	266620	pushed up by tectonic forces, so that's what we'll look at in the rest of the video. To
266620	270800	follow this process, let's start with the sedimentary material as it's moved around
270800	277600	by currents and eventually falls to the seabed. As the environment changes over time, different
277600	283640	metals, predominantly mud, silt, sand, calcium carbonate and bits of dead animals, are laid
283640	290120	down one on top of the other. Over time, they harden and that all has to do with pressure
290120	296720	and cementation that I won't go into here. Since sections of crust are constantly moving,
296720	300840	eventually the piece of crust these hardened sediments are riding on will collide with
300840	306380	another piece of crust. If you want to know how crustal plates move and collide, see my
306380	311980	last educational video, The Story of the Earth in 33 Minutes.
311980	317380	So what happens to the sedimentary layers? In this experiment, structural geologists,
317380	322620	who don't like sleeping in tents, try to find out from the comfort of a warm, dry laboratory
322620	328860	using layers of sand to represent rock strata. As one set of beds is pushed against the other,
328860	333980	they're lifted up and begin to fold. As the pressure increases, the strata uplift and
333980	341140	fold even more, sometimes to the point where the rocks that were underneath end up on top.
341140	346820	These are called recumbent folds. And the purpose of recumbent folds is to confuse geology
346820	352820	students who have to figure out why an older rock layer is lying on top of a younger one.
352820	358220	Yes, that is me with all the hair. Being hairy is one of the entry requirements for a geology
358220	364220	course, and when you graduate, you're given a beard. Even the women. Now, that's only
364220	370180	a laboratory sand experiment, you might think. Rocks don't behave like that in the real world.
370180	376220	But yes, they do. The great thing about lab experiments, apart from being warm and dry,
376220	382340	is that if you get the materials right, you can recreate what we see in the real world.
382340	388420	Water can also uplift rock strata by faulting, in other words, creating huge cracks. Now
388420	392980	that the rocks have been uplifted, whether by faulting or folding, the mountains have
392980	399620	to be further shaped by weathering and erosion. As rain falls, water finds its way across
399620	405540	the rising sedimentary beds and into the low points and cracks. As the mountains rise higher,
405540	410860	the channels cut deeper and the cracks get wider. Now they're beginning to look like
410900	417060	proper mountains. Contrary to popular belief, it's not just one tiny river that carves all this.
417060	422900	These river channels expose the rock face, but then it's other weathering forces that do most
422900	428300	of the work in opening them up. Same goes for rock formations that aren't folded or faltered,
428300	435500	just pushed up intact, and as flat as they were formed on the seabed. Erosion eats away at minor
435580	442180	cracks, which get larger and eventually become chasms that separate and isolate large chunks
442180	448500	of rock, known as outliers. You can see them in the North American desert. Eventually, the rock
448500	455940	gets eroded to a pile of sand blowing across the landscape. So how does weathering work? First,
455940	460780	there's chemical weathering, such as dissolved carbon dioxide from the air, mixing with water
460860	466860	to make a weak acid. It dissolves the silicates and carbonates that make up most rock minerals.
466860	473020	That's the weathering part. Then dissolved and broken rock is washed downwards, and the river
473020	479260	carries them away. That's the erosion. Second, there's mechanical or physical weathering,
479260	486060	like freeze and thaw, as water gets into cracks and crevices on the rock face. At night or during
486060	492300	the winter, every time temperatures dip below zero, the water freezes and expands, cracking
492300	499020	the rock. More water then comes into the larger crack, and when that freezes, it expands and the
499020	505140	crack gets larger. Repeat this thousands of times and the crack gets larger and larger until the
505140	511100	rock cracks apart. Closer to the tops of mountains, the ice never melts throughout the year,
511100	517980	so the ice acts as a kind of glue, keeping loose rock permanently together. But thanks to global
517980	523140	warming, the ice that held the rock together for millions of years is beginning to melt during the
523140	529980	summer. The rocks become unglued and the result is dangerous landslides. A few years ago I went
529980	534500	to Switzerland to do a story on how this is affecting the Alps, and while I was interviewing
534500	544300	a local expert on this phenomenon, we were interrupted by just such an event. So the snow
544300	550980	used to be around from November, around November to March, April. Now the snow doesn't begin until
550980	566260	December and we're just getting a rockfall here. The other side of the valley, these rocks are just
566260	572220	crashing down into the valley below from where the glacier has been. I don't think there could
572220	576740	be a better example of how the glue that has held these rocks together and held that mountain
576740	585940	together is now coming apart and the rocks are so loose they're just falling down. The science of
585940	592300	mapping this tangle of tilting and folding rocks is called stratigraphy. Apart from the traditional
592300	598500	hammer, the only equipment a stratigrapher needs is a compass, a clinometer and of course a carrot.
598500	604740	Okay I know what you're thinking, what the hell is a clinometer? Well it's an instrument that
604820	611340	measures the dipping angle of the rock strata. The hammer is there to expose fresh rock and it's true,
611340	616780	we do lick these rocks when we break them open. It makes it easier to see the grain structure and
616780	623060	identify the rock. Of course mineralogists do it because they like the taste. When I was a geology
623060	630020	student we used to studiously examine rock outcrops. Okay this photo isn't showing that,
630020	640780	but we did used to studiously examine rock outcrops. We used to studiously examine rock
640780	648020	outcrops. Look this was a time when university education was free so we didn't have any student
648020	655420	loans to worry about. Oh there it is. So we used to studiously examine the outcrop by bashing it
655420	662180	to pieces with our hammers. One day the sedimentology lecturer admonished us. Don't just go straight in
662180	666820	there and start hammering at the rock, he said, stand back. Look at how the surface has been
666820	672300	withered. See if you can spot any cross bedding, graded bedding or unconformities. These are all
672300	680580	clues. So the next day when we got to an outcrop we went in and this time we still started bashing
680580	686420	it to pieces with our hammers because the truth is we just like bashing rocks. It's very satisfying
686420	691300	when a layer of sediment that's been sitting untouched since it was laid down a hundred
691300	697660	million years before dinosaurs came along and in the space of half a second is crushed under the
697660	704020	hammer of an 18 year old with acne. But with hindsight our lecturer was right. I told you
704020	710100	that on my first day I was mystified as to how flat beds on the sea floor turned into a chaotic
710140	718220	jumble of rocks. But stand back, look closely and there are clues. You can still see the traces of
718220	723700	the flat beds where the sediment was laid down even though the formation has been tilted and
723700	729700	cracked. At the top of Mount Everest too you can still see the flat outline of the seabed laid down
729700	737940	400 million years ago. Sometimes the clues are very obvious but usually most folds and faults
737940	744100	stretch for miles under our feet so they can't be seen. This is what's underneath a 50 mile line
744100	750300	across Greater London. It's the bottom of a fold, a sink line, which is why a river runs there and
750300	756900	the river is why London is there. It just goes to show how much our lives are influenced by geology
756900	763460	whether we know it or not. Stratigraphers need to build up a picture of what we can't see underneath
763460	769860	our feet by looking at sparse and scattered outcrops that we can see. So they go off into
769860	774820	the wilderness for months at a time armed only with the essential tools they need to make their
774820	781460	measurements. A hammer, a compass, a clinometer and a carrot. What do you mean what's a carrot for?
781460	787340	They've got to eat. They leave behind unnecessary and cumbersome equipment like polarizing
787340	794220	microscopes and thin section cutters and a change of clothes and deodorant and when they come back
794220	799340	to civilization they're locked away in dark basements where they process all that information.
800140	805500	From the various outcrops they visited they plot the angle and direction of the dipping strata
805500	811260	and from that they build up a picture of what's underneath. The result is beautiful geological
811260	817260	columns and cross-sectional maps like these. Stratigraphers are the medieval monks of the
817260	823020	geology world and not just because they're celibate for most of the year. Some rock types
823020	828540	will baffle even the stratigraphers. The senior geologist I was working with in Australia told me
828540	833740	about a stratigrapher who was out in the field and sent back some samples of what was obviously
833740	840140	dunite with a note. Can you tell me what the pretty green rock is? The people who are experts
840140	845420	at identifying rocks are called petrologists from the ancient Greek word petros, rock.
845420	852140	The same word that gives us petroleum, rock oil. Now I have to tell you these people are fun fun
852140	857980	fun. Just take a look at this hysterical joke from a petrology website and you'll see what I mean.
858940	864780	Okay not all their jokes are as funny as that one but what they lack in quality they make up for in
864780	870540	quantity. The reason petrologists have time to think of all these jokes is because they spend
870540	877020	long hours looking at rocks and then more rocks and then other rocks. So they don't waste time
877020	883340	doing the kind of frivolous things normal people do like going out. Anyway let's get back to
883340	889180	weathering. There's a phenomenon called differential weathering which means rocks weather at different
889180	894300	rates. You can see here the hard layers are protruding because the softer layers on top
894300	899100	and below have been weathered more quickly. The material is different because of course
899100	905340	the environment in which they were laid down changed over time. When hardened soft layers
905340	911900	are tilted the same process can form hills. Even two layers of the same rock type can have different
911900	918380	hardness. So the softer layer will erode faster and when it's underneath the harder layer that
918380	923660	can leave us with features like these. Igneous rocks are the hardest of the lot.
924620	930780	Remember that pool of magma I showed you earlier? Well it cools and solidifies into a hard large
930780	937420	grained igneous rock usually granite so when the softer rocks around it are eroded the granite
937420	943420	remains a prominent feature of the landscape called a massif. Now weathering patterns in one
943420	948460	type of rock are so distinctive that even geology students can spot it from a distance.
949500	955900	This is limestone calcium carbonate the stuff seashells are made of and calcium carbonate is
955900	962780	a strong alkali so even a weak acid like co2 dissolved in water will eat it away very quickly.
963740	968780	This is a model but it shows how limestone has a tendency to crack not only along its
968780	975740	bedding planes but also at right angles to them forming blocks. So it's like the sandstone outlier
975740	982620	process we saw earlier but on steroids. Acidic water seeps into cracks and dissolves them
982620	990220	isolating and reducing the blocks. It forms what's called a cast landscape. The limestone
990220	996620	also gets eaten away underground causing huge caves which sometimes flood when the water table
996620	1002380	rises. When these can no longer support the weight of rock above them they collapse forming
1002380	1009180	sinkholes like the famous cenotes of Mexico. Because it's fine-grained and often made from
1009180	1015100	fossilized sea creatures limestone can be a treasure trove of fossils a branch of geology
1015100	1021580	called paleontology. Here we see a fashionable paleontologist in his typical working attire
1021580	1027500	just off on a jaunt collecting fossils. You can look for fossils yourselves but it's not
1027500	1031980	a good idea to take a paleontologist with you because when they find something interesting
1031980	1038140	they tend to drool. Finally there's one last process shaping our mountains and it's the most
1038140	1046620	recent. Over the last two million years the earth has been and still is in an ice age. During colder
1046620	1052620	phases called glaciations ice sheets and glaciers advanced over much of the continents and as they
1052620	1060060	moved they shaped the ground underneath. Think of a glacier as a slow-moving river of ice. Rocks that
1060060	1066140	had shattered through freeze thaw fell into the glaciers. Rocks that were plucked from the ground
1066140	1071740	were swept along and all were smoothed over thousands of years as they rubbed up against
1071740	1077980	other rocks. They were dragged across in situ formations leaving scrape marks we can still see
1077980	1085100	today called glacial scarring. V-shaped valleys were ground into u-shaped valleys by the rivers of ice.
1085980	1091500	When the ice finally melted and the glaciers retreated the huge boulders they'd carried were
1091500	1099180	left high and dry dumped on the landscape. They're called erratics. Now how can you tell the difference
1099180	1104300	between a balancing rock that's an erratic from one that's been weathered? An outlier.
1105020	1110620	Obviously the outlier is still attached at the base because it hasn't been moved. It's in situ.
1111580	1117420	But there are other clues. Strata in a weathered rock will typically have the same dip and direction
1117420	1123980	as the strata to which it's attached and it'll fit into the sequence. A glacial erratic is usually
1123980	1129100	smoothed and made of a completely different material to the rock it sits on unattached.
1130060	1134380	You can see the strata quite clearly in the famous balanced rock of Colorado Springs.
1134940	1141260	It was formed nearly 300 million years ago from sand deposited at sea then lifted up with the
1141260	1148540	Colorado mountains and weathered over millions of years by wind and rain. To get to this unique site
1148540	1154140	involves a long hike through the eastern Rocky Mountains. At least it would except this is the
1154140	1160220	United States so of course they made it into a drive-in. So the growth of mountains is a tug of
1160220	1166780	war between uplift and erosion, the two great principles of geology. As the continents continue
1166780	1172620	to collide today uplift in these regions is greater than erosion so mountain chains between
1172620	1179180	them are still rising. Africa is still crashing into Europe, squeezing the Mediterranean and
1179180	1186220	throwing up the Alps. India is still crashing into Asia and lifting the Himalayas. The higher
1186220	1192700	these mountain chains go the faster they weather. Where the collisions have stopped the forces
1192700	1198540	pushing these mountain ranges up are no longer operating so erosion takes over as the dominant
1198620	1204300	force. The longer the period of tectonic inactivity has been the lower the mountains
1204300	1210220	have been worn down. The Grampian Mountains in Scotland for example formed when North America
1210220	1216220	crashed into Europe 450 million years ago and they were once as impressive as the Alps.
1216940	1222620	Then the collisions stopped, erosion took over as the dominant force and most of the sedimentary
1222620	1228780	rock has now been eroded away. All that's left are the igneous and metamorphic rocks
1228780	1234940	that were once deep inside the mountain range. If you're a geomorphologist I bet you're getting
1234940	1240700	very excited right now. If you think I've left a few things out from a three-year geology course
1240700	1248780	in a 30-minute video you'd be absolutely right. I've left out about 2,624 and a half hours of
1248780	1254700	material so I'm sure the comments section will be filled with things I supposedly forgot to mention.
1255420	1259580	Thanks in advance but I haven't forgotten anything. I've just shown you a rough guide to
1259580	1264700	the basics. If I've got anything wrong and you're watching this more than two days after the video
1264700	1270540	was released it will already be in the corrections section of the video description so do check that
1270540	1276380	please. And if you'd like to find out more well there's a wealth of information on the internet
1276380	1282380	from online encyclopedias to universities schools and geological institutes with educational
1282380	1288700	websites and all for free. You don't know how lucky you are to have all this information
1288700	1294220	with just a few clicks of a search engine because when I was a student we had to scour the library
1294220	1300220	to find what we needed. So of course in the internet age everyone is now learning from these
1300220	1306300	sites and is better educated. Ah who am I kidding of course they aren't. People don't want to bother
1306300	1311420	using the internet to find out how the earth really works. It's much more exciting to take
1311420	1317580	lessons from bloggers and vloggers who say that the earth is expanding or it's hollow or it's flat
1317580	1322860	rather than trying to understand any of that complicated math chemistry and geophysics that
1322860	1328700	real geologists have to put up with. It's so much easier to imagine that a balancing rock on Mars
1328700	1333820	was carved by martians and to save you the trouble of learning why a piece of coral is found on top
1333820	1338620	of a mountain it's much easier to put the question on reddit and have people explain
1338620	1345500	to you maybe someone carried it there. To those people I say by all means ignore the discoveries
1345500	1350940	made by petrologists, mineralogists, stratigraphers and paleontologists who cut themselves off from
1350940	1356460	the civilised world for most of the year and forego the comforts of life like bathing in
1356460	1361660	order to find the oil that runs your car, the coal that powers your electricity, the iron ore that
1361660	1367820	builds the bridges you drive over and the precious metals you need for your phone. Ignore their work
1367820	1373580	and their sacrifice if you prefer to believe in martians but if you don't believe any of this
1373580	1379900	geology stuff then stop running your car, your computer and your phone and don't go anywhere.
1379900	1385740	See what life would be like without them. To the others who've made it this far and who are
1385740	1393180	interested in the real world I hope this video has been useful. Wait don't go yet! I don't ask
1393180	1398380	for contributions for my channel and I don't make any money out of my videos so if you like the
1398380	1403900	video and want to contribute something I always request that you send the money to this charity
1403900	1409740	instead. It's an innovative scheme that offers subsidised medical care to poor people who live
1409740	1415500	in or near forests in exchange for not cutting down the trees because the reason they cut down
1415500	1420940	the trees in the past was because they needed cash urgently when members of the family were sick.
1421740	1426220	The scheme has been so successful that studies have been written about it and found that people
1426220	1431740	in the areas where it's operating are healthier and illegal logging has been drastically reduced.
1432460	1439820	So far donations in my name from subscribers to this channel have reached $270,000 and that's
1439820	1445580	helped expand the scheme from Indonesia to Madagascar and Brazil. So if you've always
1445580	1451180	faced the dilemma of whether you should donate money to help poor people or save the forests,
1451180	1454940	well now you can do both. Details are in the video description.
