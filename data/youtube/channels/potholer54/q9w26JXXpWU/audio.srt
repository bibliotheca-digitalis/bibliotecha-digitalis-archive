1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,000
Humans and animals and plants were much larger before Noah's flood.

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:16,000
Here is a dragonfly, and it's got a 50 inch wingspan, that's a fossilized dragonfly found in Italy.

3
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:17,000
I can't imagine that.

4
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:21,000
Can you imagine a dragonfly flying around in your sitting room?

5
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:22,000
No.

6
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:24,000
50 inches across.

7
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:26,000
Never frightened the life out of me, don't know about you.

8
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:27,000
Doesn't bother me.

9
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:34,000
Now, cockroaches, fossilized cockroaches, they found fossil cockroaches 18 inches long.

10
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:35,000
I certainly can't imagine that.

11
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:40,000
Can you imagine what it would feel like to have a cockroach 18 inches long

12
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:41,000
I can't imagine.

13
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:43,000
coming out of the cupboard underneath your kitchen sink?

14
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:45,000
No.

15
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:49,000
Fossils of grasshoppers have been found over 2 feet long.

16
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:50,000
Don't ask me to imagine it.

17
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,000
That would be huge. Can you imagine looking out onto your garden

18
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:53,000
No.

19
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:55,000
and seeing a 2 foot long grasshopper?

20
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:56,000
No, I said I can't imagine it.

21
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,000
Well, that's what the fossil record actually shows.

22
00:00:58,000 --> 00:00:59,000
I don't care.

23
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:01,000
So maybe we'd have to go on a grasshopper hunt.

24
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:03,000
I am not going to imagine this one.

25
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:05,000
Giant tarantula.

26
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:07,000
I'm not going to imagine it.

27
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:09,000
Great big spiders, a foot long.

28
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:11,000
Don't make me imagine it.

29
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:12,000
Can you imagine that?

30
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:13,000
No.

31
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:17,000
Imagine that scuttling across your floor as you're watching this now.

32
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:21,000
Cattails have been found 60 feet high.

33
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:22,000
Can you imagine?

34
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:23,000
No.

35
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:24,000
Can you imagine?

36
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:27,000
I'm going to get a glass of water.

37
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:30,000
Don't say anything.

38
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:36,000
Can you imagine that grass 60 feet high in the sedimentary rock?

39
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:39,000
Well, you're going to ask, what about dinosaurs?

40
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:41,000
We'll come onto that in a minute.

41
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:44,000
First, what exactly is all this about?

42
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:48,000
Well, Dr Richard Kent explains that oxygen levels were much higher in the past

43
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:51,000
and that's given him a new theory about the dinosaurs.

44
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:55,000
Oxygen levels were indeed much higher during the Carboniferous

45
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:58,000
but that was long before humans appeared on Earth.

46
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:02,000
Nearly all of the unimaginably large insect fossils he's showing us

47
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:05,000
were found in Carboniferous sedimentary rock.

48
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:07,000
Why did they grow so large?

49
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:09,000
Because insects don't have lungs.

50
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:11,000
They take in oxygen through their skin.

51
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:14,000
This isn't very efficient and limits their body size

52
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:17,000
according to the amount of oxygen in the atmosphere.

53
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:20,000
But Kent has to make all this fit the Bible.

54
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:24,000
A contortion that requires his new theory about the dinosaurs.

55
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:29,000
I have with me tonight an elk, Mrs Anne Elk.

56
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:33,000
You have a new theory about the Brontosaurus.

57
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:37,000
Now here's just a drawing of an 80 foot long Apatosaurus,

58
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:39,000
also known as a Brontosaurus.

59
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:43,000
And if you go to the Natural History Museum in London and look at the skeleton,

60
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:48,000
you'll find that the skeleton of an Apatosaurus or a Brontosaurus

61
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:53,000
has very, very small nostrils about the same size as a horse.

62
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:57,000
Wilkis, you may well ask me what is my theory?

63
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:01,000
I am asking.

64
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:04,000
Well, very simply, before the flood,

65
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:08,000
dinosaurs lived in a very, very high oxygen environment.

66
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:12,000
But after the flood, they were in terrible trouble

67
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:15,000
because their nostrils were simply not well adapted

68
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:19,000
for breathing in a low oxygen environment.

69
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:21,000
Now, I don't know if you've heard about in England,

70
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:23,000
we talk about St George and the dragon.

71
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:26,000
And dragons, not much is known about them.

72
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:29,000
Well, I'll tell you one thing that's known about dragons, Richard.

73
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:32,000
They're not real. They're creatures from mythology.

74
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:38,000
We know as much about dragons as we do unicorns, water nymphs and flying reindeer.

75
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:41,000
But come on, I want to hear your theory about the dinosaurs.

76
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:46,000
Now, I want you to imagine a dinosaur living in a low oxygen environment

77
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:54,000
with huge great lungs about the size possibly of the room you're in right now,

78
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:58,000
breathing through tiny, tiny little nostrils

79
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:01,000
which were not adapted for a low oxygen environment.

80
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:06,000
Well, what would happen as that poor dinosaur was breathing heavily

81
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,000
in and out through those very narrow nostrils?

82
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:09,000
Well, I'll tell you what would happen.

83
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:11,000
It's the nostrils would catch on fire.

84
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:18,000
I'm sorry, my brain must be numbed by listening to too many creationist videos.

85
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:21,000
For a moment I thought you said that breathing heavily

86
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:24,000
would cause their nostrils to catch on fire.

87
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,000
You didn't say that, did you?

88
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:31,000
Maybe that's how we get legends of fire-breathing dragons.

89
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:35,000
They're simply dinosaurs which are having trouble breathing

90
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:43,000
and cause their nostrils to come alight and breathe out fire.

91
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:46,000
See, this bullshit sticks in even your throat.

92
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:49,000
Well, of course, there's only one way to find out.

93
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:53,000
Following the great success of our chickens laying eggs on the run experiment,

94
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:58,000
I gave Dr Kent Free access to our nutty creationist ideas testing lab

95
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:01,000
to test his theory that if you breathe in and out really quickly,

96
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:03,000
your nostrils will catch fire.

97
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:15,000
Hello, everyone.

98
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:18,000
We started our experiment on canines.

99
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:28,000
As you can see, the theory definitely works on dogs.

100
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:31,000
Here we see a young boy whose excessive masturbation

101
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:36,000
has brought on unstoppable heavy breathing with devastating consequences.

102
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:39,000
Can you imagine your pubic hair burning?

103
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:41,000
That would frighten the life out of me.

104
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:44,000
And it's well known that while recording Je t'aime one en plus,

105
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:49,000
Serge Gainsbourg breathed so heavily that his nostrils caught fire in the recording studio

106
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:52,000
and had to be extinguished with a bottle of Pinot Meunier.

107
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:55,000
Je t'aime. Je t'aime.

108
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:57,000
Oui, je t'aime.

109
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:06,000
And, of course, during a stage performance of the song in 1976,

110
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:11,000
Jane Birkin got so carried away that her entire bosom area spontaneously exploded.

111
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:18,000
Even today, hundreds of people suffer from spontaneous combustors in Australia

112
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:20,000
while listening to the song.

113
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:22,000
So what have we learnt from this?

114
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:25,000
If nostrils ever do catch fire due to heavy breathing,

115
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:29,000
it's been witnessed about as often as we've seen fire-breathing dragons.

116
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:33,000
But before we go, there's just one other part of the Richard Kent dinosaur theory

117
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:35,000
we have to flush down the toilet.

118
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:40,000
Kent doesn't think every single dinosaur was finished off by combustible nostrils.

119
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:44,000
Some of the dinosaurs had more robust nose parts and survived.

120
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:48,000
Now, there are still actually dinosaurs around the world.

121
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:54,000
In 1959, a missionary in the Congo said that two pygmies

122
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:57,000
had killed what they called a makale mobembe,

123
00:06:57,000 --> 00:07:01,000
and there's a drawing which they made of the makale mobembe,

124
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:05,000
and it looks to me very much like a dinosaur.

125
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:07,000
A drawing that they made.

126
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:11,000
Now, I don't want to belittle the artistic skills of the Congo pygmies,

127
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:14,000
but I was sceptical of the claim that they drew this picture.

128
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:17,000
Yes, I agree with Kent, it does look very much like a dinosaur,

129
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:21,000
but it has all the hallmarks of a Western artist's impression.

130
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:23,000
And it took less than a minute to check.

131
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:28,000
I simply googled makale mobembe and came up with a number of drawings,

132
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:31,000
including this one, the same picture.

133
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:34,000
So then I checked the website where it had been posted

134
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:37,000
and discovered that the artists were Earl and Bonnie Snellenberger.

135
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:40,000
Are they by any chance Congo pygmies?

136
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:42,000
No, they're illustrators for children's books.

137
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:45,000
Children's creationist books, that is.

138
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:49,000
Or, to be more specific, children's creationist books

139
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:52,000
that teach that dinosaurs are still alive today.

140
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:55,000
So Kent's evidence that this animal might be a dinosaur

141
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:59,000
because of the remarkable physiological characteristics found in the drawing

142
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:02,000
is based on the fact that it was deliberately drawn that way

143
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:04,000
by two creationist artists.

144
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:08,000
We might as well conclude that people kept dinosaurs as pets

145
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:10,000
because that's what we see in the Flintstones.

146
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:12,000
Can you imagine what it would feel like?

147
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:14,000
No, but it's not real.

148
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:16,000
It would never frighten the life out of me. Don't know about you.

149
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:19,000
It's not scary, Richard. It's a cartoon.

150
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:22,000
Can you imagine going to the seaside and seeing a 12-foot tortoise?

151
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:24,000
No, I don't want to start that.

152
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:26,000
Can you imagine looking out onto your god?

153
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:28,000
Shut up.

154
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:00,000
I'm afraid of you.

155
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:03,000
I'm afraid of you.

156
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:07,000
I'm afraid of you.

157
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:10,000
I'm afraid of you.

158
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:16,000
Aah!

159
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:19,000
Oh, my love.

160
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:22,000
You are my love.

161
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:25,000
My love.

162
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:33,000
Too far, too far to move, yeah.
