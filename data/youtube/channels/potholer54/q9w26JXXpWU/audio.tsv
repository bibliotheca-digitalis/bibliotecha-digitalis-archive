0	6000	Humans and animals and plants were much larger before Noah's flood.
6000	16000	Here is a dragonfly, and it's got a 50 inch wingspan, that's a fossilized dragonfly found in Italy.
16000	17000	I can't imagine that.
17000	21000	Can you imagine a dragonfly flying around in your sitting room?
21000	22000	No.
22000	24000	50 inches across.
24000	26000	Never frightened the life out of me, don't know about you.
26000	27000	Doesn't bother me.
27000	34000	Now, cockroaches, fossilized cockroaches, they found fossil cockroaches 18 inches long.
34000	35000	I certainly can't imagine that.
35000	40000	Can you imagine what it would feel like to have a cockroach 18 inches long
40000	41000	I can't imagine.
41000	43000	coming out of the cupboard underneath your kitchen sink?
43000	45000	No.
45000	49000	Fossils of grasshoppers have been found over 2 feet long.
49000	50000	Don't ask me to imagine it.
50000	52000	That would be huge. Can you imagine looking out onto your garden
52000	53000	No.
53000	55000	and seeing a 2 foot long grasshopper?
55000	56000	No, I said I can't imagine it.
56000	58000	Well, that's what the fossil record actually shows.
58000	59000	I don't care.
59000	61000	So maybe we'd have to go on a grasshopper hunt.
61000	63000	I am not going to imagine this one.
63000	65000	Giant tarantula.
65000	67000	I'm not going to imagine it.
67000	69000	Great big spiders, a foot long.
69000	71000	Don't make me imagine it.
71000	72000	Can you imagine that?
72000	73000	No.
73000	77000	Imagine that scuttling across your floor as you're watching this now.
77000	81000	Cattails have been found 60 feet high.
81000	82000	Can you imagine?
82000	83000	No.
83000	84000	Can you imagine?
84000	87000	I'm going to get a glass of water.
87000	90000	Don't say anything.
90000	96000	Can you imagine that grass 60 feet high in the sedimentary rock?
96000	99000	Well, you're going to ask, what about dinosaurs?
99000	101000	We'll come onto that in a minute.
101000	104000	First, what exactly is all this about?
104000	108000	Well, Dr Richard Kent explains that oxygen levels were much higher in the past
108000	111000	and that's given him a new theory about the dinosaurs.
111000	115000	Oxygen levels were indeed much higher during the Carboniferous
115000	118000	but that was long before humans appeared on Earth.
118000	122000	Nearly all of the unimaginably large insect fossils he's showing us
122000	125000	were found in Carboniferous sedimentary rock.
125000	127000	Why did they grow so large?
127000	129000	Because insects don't have lungs.
129000	131000	They take in oxygen through their skin.
131000	134000	This isn't very efficient and limits their body size
134000	137000	according to the amount of oxygen in the atmosphere.
137000	140000	But Kent has to make all this fit the Bible.
140000	144000	A contortion that requires his new theory about the dinosaurs.
144000	149000	I have with me tonight an elk, Mrs Anne Elk.
149000	153000	You have a new theory about the Brontosaurus.
153000	157000	Now here's just a drawing of an 80 foot long Apatosaurus,
157000	159000	also known as a Brontosaurus.
159000	163000	And if you go to the Natural History Museum in London and look at the skeleton,
163000	168000	you'll find that the skeleton of an Apatosaurus or a Brontosaurus
168000	173000	has very, very small nostrils about the same size as a horse.
173000	177000	Wilkis, you may well ask me what is my theory?
179000	181000	I am asking.
181000	184000	Well, very simply, before the flood,
184000	188000	dinosaurs lived in a very, very high oxygen environment.
188000	192000	But after the flood, they were in terrible trouble
192000	195000	because their nostrils were simply not well adapted
195000	199000	for breathing in a low oxygen environment.
199000	201000	Now, I don't know if you've heard about in England,
201000	203000	we talk about St George and the dragon.
203000	206000	And dragons, not much is known about them.
206000	209000	Well, I'll tell you one thing that's known about dragons, Richard.
209000	212000	They're not real. They're creatures from mythology.
212000	218000	We know as much about dragons as we do unicorns, water nymphs and flying reindeer.
218000	221000	But come on, I want to hear your theory about the dinosaurs.
221000	226000	Now, I want you to imagine a dinosaur living in a low oxygen environment
226000	234000	with huge great lungs about the size possibly of the room you're in right now,
234000	238000	breathing through tiny, tiny little nostrils
238000	241000	which were not adapted for a low oxygen environment.
241000	246000	Well, what would happen as that poor dinosaur was breathing heavily
246000	248000	in and out through those very narrow nostrils?
248000	249000	Well, I'll tell you what would happen.
249000	251000	It's the nostrils would catch on fire.
254000	258000	I'm sorry, my brain must be numbed by listening to too many creationist videos.
258000	261000	For a moment I thought you said that breathing heavily
261000	264000	would cause their nostrils to catch on fire.
264000	266000	You didn't say that, did you?
266000	271000	Maybe that's how we get legends of fire-breathing dragons.
271000	275000	They're simply dinosaurs which are having trouble breathing
275000	283000	and cause their nostrils to come alight and breathe out fire.
283000	286000	See, this bullshit sticks in even your throat.
286000	289000	Well, of course, there's only one way to find out.
289000	293000	Following the great success of our chickens laying eggs on the run experiment,
293000	298000	I gave Dr Kent Free access to our nutty creationist ideas testing lab
298000	301000	to test his theory that if you breathe in and out really quickly,
301000	303000	your nostrils will catch fire.
305000	315000	Hello, everyone.
315000	318000	We started our experiment on canines.
325000	328000	As you can see, the theory definitely works on dogs.
328000	331000	Here we see a young boy whose excessive masturbation
331000	336000	has brought on unstoppable heavy breathing with devastating consequences.
336000	339000	Can you imagine your pubic hair burning?
339000	341000	That would frighten the life out of me.
341000	344000	And it's well known that while recording Je t'aime one en plus,
344000	349000	Serge Gainsbourg breathed so heavily that his nostrils caught fire in the recording studio
349000	352000	and had to be extinguished with a bottle of Pinot Meunier.
352000	355000	Je t'aime. Je t'aime.
355000	357000	Oui, je t'aime.
363000	366000	And, of course, during a stage performance of the song in 1976,
366000	371000	Jane Birkin got so carried away that her entire bosom area spontaneously exploded.
374000	378000	Even today, hundreds of people suffer from spontaneous combustors in Australia
378000	380000	while listening to the song.
380000	382000	So what have we learnt from this?
382000	385000	If nostrils ever do catch fire due to heavy breathing,
385000	389000	it's been witnessed about as often as we've seen fire-breathing dragons.
389000	393000	But before we go, there's just one other part of the Richard Kent dinosaur theory
393000	395000	we have to flush down the toilet.
395000	400000	Kent doesn't think every single dinosaur was finished off by combustible nostrils.
400000	404000	Some of the dinosaurs had more robust nose parts and survived.
404000	408000	Now, there are still actually dinosaurs around the world.
408000	414000	In 1959, a missionary in the Congo said that two pygmies
414000	417000	had killed what they called a makale mobembe,
417000	421000	and there's a drawing which they made of the makale mobembe,
421000	425000	and it looks to me very much like a dinosaur.
425000	427000	A drawing that they made.
427000	431000	Now, I don't want to belittle the artistic skills of the Congo pygmies,
431000	434000	but I was sceptical of the claim that they drew this picture.
434000	437000	Yes, I agree with Kent, it does look very much like a dinosaur,
437000	441000	but it has all the hallmarks of a Western artist's impression.
441000	443000	And it took less than a minute to check.
443000	448000	I simply googled makale mobembe and came up with a number of drawings,
448000	451000	including this one, the same picture.
451000	454000	So then I checked the website where it had been posted
454000	457000	and discovered that the artists were Earl and Bonnie Snellenberger.
457000	460000	Are they by any chance Congo pygmies?
460000	462000	No, they're illustrators for children's books.
462000	465000	Children's creationist books, that is.
465000	469000	Or, to be more specific, children's creationist books
469000	472000	that teach that dinosaurs are still alive today.
472000	475000	So Kent's evidence that this animal might be a dinosaur
475000	479000	because of the remarkable physiological characteristics found in the drawing
479000	482000	is based on the fact that it was deliberately drawn that way
482000	484000	by two creationist artists.
484000	488000	We might as well conclude that people kept dinosaurs as pets
488000	490000	because that's what we see in the Flintstones.
490000	492000	Can you imagine what it would feel like?
492000	494000	No, but it's not real.
494000	496000	It would never frighten the life out of me. Don't know about you.
496000	499000	It's not scary, Richard. It's a cartoon.
499000	502000	Can you imagine going to the seaside and seeing a 12-foot tortoise?
502000	504000	No, I don't want to start that.
504000	506000	Can you imagine looking out onto your god?
506000	508000	Shut up.
538000	540000	I'm afraid of you.
541000	543000	I'm afraid of you.
545000	547000	I'm afraid of you.
548000	550000	I'm afraid of you.
554000	556000	Aah!
557000	559000	Oh, my love.
560000	562000	You are my love.
563000	565000	My love.
568000	573000	Too far, too far to move, yeah.
