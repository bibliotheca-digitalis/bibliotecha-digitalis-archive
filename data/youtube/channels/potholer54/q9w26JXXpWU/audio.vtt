00:00.000 --> 00:06.000
Humans and animals and plants were much larger before Noah's flood.

00:06.000 --> 00:16.000
Here is a dragonfly, and it's got a 50 inch wingspan, that's a fossilized dragonfly found in Italy.

00:16.000 --> 00:17.000
I can't imagine that.

00:17.000 --> 00:21.000
Can you imagine a dragonfly flying around in your sitting room?

00:21.000 --> 00:22.000
No.

00:22.000 --> 00:24.000
50 inches across.

00:24.000 --> 00:26.000
Never frightened the life out of me, don't know about you.

00:26.000 --> 00:27.000
Doesn't bother me.

00:27.000 --> 00:34.000
Now, cockroaches, fossilized cockroaches, they found fossil cockroaches 18 inches long.

00:34.000 --> 00:35.000
I certainly can't imagine that.

00:35.000 --> 00:40.000
Can you imagine what it would feel like to have a cockroach 18 inches long

00:40.000 --> 00:41.000
I can't imagine.

00:41.000 --> 00:43.000
coming out of the cupboard underneath your kitchen sink?

00:43.000 --> 00:45.000
No.

00:45.000 --> 00:49.000
Fossils of grasshoppers have been found over 2 feet long.

00:49.000 --> 00:50.000
Don't ask me to imagine it.

00:50.000 --> 00:52.000
That would be huge. Can you imagine looking out onto your garden

00:52.000 --> 00:53.000
No.

00:53.000 --> 00:55.000
and seeing a 2 foot long grasshopper?

00:55.000 --> 00:56.000
No, I said I can't imagine it.

00:56.000 --> 00:58.000
Well, that's what the fossil record actually shows.

00:58.000 --> 00:59.000
I don't care.

00:59.000 --> 01:01.000
So maybe we'd have to go on a grasshopper hunt.

01:01.000 --> 01:03.000
I am not going to imagine this one.

01:03.000 --> 01:05.000
Giant tarantula.

01:05.000 --> 01:07.000
I'm not going to imagine it.

01:07.000 --> 01:09.000
Great big spiders, a foot long.

01:09.000 --> 01:11.000
Don't make me imagine it.

01:11.000 --> 01:12.000
Can you imagine that?

01:12.000 --> 01:13.000
No.

01:13.000 --> 01:17.000
Imagine that scuttling across your floor as you're watching this now.

01:17.000 --> 01:21.000
Cattails have been found 60 feet high.

01:21.000 --> 01:22.000
Can you imagine?

01:22.000 --> 01:23.000
No.

01:23.000 --> 01:24.000
Can you imagine?

01:24.000 --> 01:27.000
I'm going to get a glass of water.

01:27.000 --> 01:30.000
Don't say anything.

01:30.000 --> 01:36.000
Can you imagine that grass 60 feet high in the sedimentary rock?

01:36.000 --> 01:39.000
Well, you're going to ask, what about dinosaurs?

01:39.000 --> 01:41.000
We'll come onto that in a minute.

01:41.000 --> 01:44.000
First, what exactly is all this about?

01:44.000 --> 01:48.000
Well, Dr Richard Kent explains that oxygen levels were much higher in the past

01:48.000 --> 01:51.000
and that's given him a new theory about the dinosaurs.

01:51.000 --> 01:55.000
Oxygen levels were indeed much higher during the Carboniferous

01:55.000 --> 01:58.000
but that was long before humans appeared on Earth.

01:58.000 --> 02:02.000
Nearly all of the unimaginably large insect fossils he's showing us

02:02.000 --> 02:05.000
were found in Carboniferous sedimentary rock.

02:05.000 --> 02:07.000
Why did they grow so large?

02:07.000 --> 02:09.000
Because insects don't have lungs.

02:09.000 --> 02:11.000
They take in oxygen through their skin.

02:11.000 --> 02:14.000
This isn't very efficient and limits their body size

02:14.000 --> 02:17.000
according to the amount of oxygen in the atmosphere.

02:17.000 --> 02:20.000
But Kent has to make all this fit the Bible.

02:20.000 --> 02:24.000
A contortion that requires his new theory about the dinosaurs.

02:24.000 --> 02:29.000
I have with me tonight an elk, Mrs Anne Elk.

02:29.000 --> 02:33.000
You have a new theory about the Brontosaurus.

02:33.000 --> 02:37.000
Now here's just a drawing of an 80 foot long Apatosaurus,

02:37.000 --> 02:39.000
also known as a Brontosaurus.

02:39.000 --> 02:43.000
And if you go to the Natural History Museum in London and look at the skeleton,

02:43.000 --> 02:48.000
you'll find that the skeleton of an Apatosaurus or a Brontosaurus

02:48.000 --> 02:53.000
has very, very small nostrils about the same size as a horse.

02:53.000 --> 02:57.000
Wilkis, you may well ask me what is my theory?

02:59.000 --> 03:01.000
I am asking.

03:01.000 --> 03:04.000
Well, very simply, before the flood,

03:04.000 --> 03:08.000
dinosaurs lived in a very, very high oxygen environment.

03:08.000 --> 03:12.000
But after the flood, they were in terrible trouble

03:12.000 --> 03:15.000
because their nostrils were simply not well adapted

03:15.000 --> 03:19.000
for breathing in a low oxygen environment.

03:19.000 --> 03:21.000
Now, I don't know if you've heard about in England,

03:21.000 --> 03:23.000
we talk about St George and the dragon.

03:23.000 --> 03:26.000
And dragons, not much is known about them.

03:26.000 --> 03:29.000
Well, I'll tell you one thing that's known about dragons, Richard.

03:29.000 --> 03:32.000
They're not real. They're creatures from mythology.

03:32.000 --> 03:38.000
We know as much about dragons as we do unicorns, water nymphs and flying reindeer.

03:38.000 --> 03:41.000
But come on, I want to hear your theory about the dinosaurs.

03:41.000 --> 03:46.000
Now, I want you to imagine a dinosaur living in a low oxygen environment

03:46.000 --> 03:54.000
with huge great lungs about the size possibly of the room you're in right now,

03:54.000 --> 03:58.000
breathing through tiny, tiny little nostrils

03:58.000 --> 04:01.000
which were not adapted for a low oxygen environment.

04:01.000 --> 04:06.000
Well, what would happen as that poor dinosaur was breathing heavily

04:06.000 --> 04:08.000
in and out through those very narrow nostrils?

04:08.000 --> 04:09.000
Well, I'll tell you what would happen.

04:09.000 --> 04:11.000
It's the nostrils would catch on fire.

04:14.000 --> 04:18.000
I'm sorry, my brain must be numbed by listening to too many creationist videos.

04:18.000 --> 04:21.000
For a moment I thought you said that breathing heavily

04:21.000 --> 04:24.000
would cause their nostrils to catch on fire.

04:24.000 --> 04:26.000
You didn't say that, did you?

04:26.000 --> 04:31.000
Maybe that's how we get legends of fire-breathing dragons.

04:31.000 --> 04:35.000
They're simply dinosaurs which are having trouble breathing

04:35.000 --> 04:43.000
and cause their nostrils to come alight and breathe out fire.

04:43.000 --> 04:46.000
See, this bullshit sticks in even your throat.

04:46.000 --> 04:49.000
Well, of course, there's only one way to find out.

04:49.000 --> 04:53.000
Following the great success of our chickens laying eggs on the run experiment,

04:53.000 --> 04:58.000
I gave Dr Kent Free access to our nutty creationist ideas testing lab

04:58.000 --> 05:01.000
to test his theory that if you breathe in and out really quickly,

05:01.000 --> 05:03.000
your nostrils will catch fire.

05:05.000 --> 05:15.000
Hello, everyone.

05:15.000 --> 05:18.000
We started our experiment on canines.

05:25.000 --> 05:28.000
As you can see, the theory definitely works on dogs.

05:28.000 --> 05:31.000
Here we see a young boy whose excessive masturbation

05:31.000 --> 05:36.000
has brought on unstoppable heavy breathing with devastating consequences.

05:36.000 --> 05:39.000
Can you imagine your pubic hair burning?

05:39.000 --> 05:41.000
That would frighten the life out of me.

05:41.000 --> 05:44.000
And it's well known that while recording Je t'aime one en plus,

05:44.000 --> 05:49.000
Serge Gainsbourg breathed so heavily that his nostrils caught fire in the recording studio

05:49.000 --> 05:52.000
and had to be extinguished with a bottle of Pinot Meunier.

05:52.000 --> 05:55.000
Je t'aime. Je t'aime.

05:55.000 --> 05:57.000
Oui, je t'aime.

06:03.000 --> 06:06.000
And, of course, during a stage performance of the song in 1976,

06:06.000 --> 06:11.000
Jane Birkin got so carried away that her entire bosom area spontaneously exploded.

06:14.000 --> 06:18.000
Even today, hundreds of people suffer from spontaneous combustors in Australia

06:18.000 --> 06:20.000
while listening to the song.

06:20.000 --> 06:22.000
So what have we learnt from this?

06:22.000 --> 06:25.000
If nostrils ever do catch fire due to heavy breathing,

06:25.000 --> 06:29.000
it's been witnessed about as often as we've seen fire-breathing dragons.

06:29.000 --> 06:33.000
But before we go, there's just one other part of the Richard Kent dinosaur theory

06:33.000 --> 06:35.000
we have to flush down the toilet.

06:35.000 --> 06:40.000
Kent doesn't think every single dinosaur was finished off by combustible nostrils.

06:40.000 --> 06:44.000
Some of the dinosaurs had more robust nose parts and survived.

06:44.000 --> 06:48.000
Now, there are still actually dinosaurs around the world.

06:48.000 --> 06:54.000
In 1959, a missionary in the Congo said that two pygmies

06:54.000 --> 06:57.000
had killed what they called a makale mobembe,

06:57.000 --> 07:01.000
and there's a drawing which they made of the makale mobembe,

07:01.000 --> 07:05.000
and it looks to me very much like a dinosaur.

07:05.000 --> 07:07.000
A drawing that they made.

07:07.000 --> 07:11.000
Now, I don't want to belittle the artistic skills of the Congo pygmies,

07:11.000 --> 07:14.000
but I was sceptical of the claim that they drew this picture.

07:14.000 --> 07:17.000
Yes, I agree with Kent, it does look very much like a dinosaur,

07:17.000 --> 07:21.000
but it has all the hallmarks of a Western artist's impression.

07:21.000 --> 07:23.000
And it took less than a minute to check.

07:23.000 --> 07:28.000
I simply googled makale mobembe and came up with a number of drawings,

07:28.000 --> 07:31.000
including this one, the same picture.

07:31.000 --> 07:34.000
So then I checked the website where it had been posted

07:34.000 --> 07:37.000
and discovered that the artists were Earl and Bonnie Snellenberger.

07:37.000 --> 07:40.000
Are they by any chance Congo pygmies?

07:40.000 --> 07:42.000
No, they're illustrators for children's books.

07:42.000 --> 07:45.000
Children's creationist books, that is.

07:45.000 --> 07:49.000
Or, to be more specific, children's creationist books

07:49.000 --> 07:52.000
that teach that dinosaurs are still alive today.

07:52.000 --> 07:55.000
So Kent's evidence that this animal might be a dinosaur

07:55.000 --> 07:59.000
because of the remarkable physiological characteristics found in the drawing

07:59.000 --> 08:02.000
is based on the fact that it was deliberately drawn that way

08:02.000 --> 08:04.000
by two creationist artists.

08:04.000 --> 08:08.000
We might as well conclude that people kept dinosaurs as pets

08:08.000 --> 08:10.000
because that's what we see in the Flintstones.

08:10.000 --> 08:12.000
Can you imagine what it would feel like?

08:12.000 --> 08:14.000
No, but it's not real.

08:14.000 --> 08:16.000
It would never frighten the life out of me. Don't know about you.

08:16.000 --> 08:19.000
It's not scary, Richard. It's a cartoon.

08:19.000 --> 08:22.000
Can you imagine going to the seaside and seeing a 12-foot tortoise?

08:22.000 --> 08:24.000
No, I don't want to start that.

08:24.000 --> 08:26.000
Can you imagine looking out onto your god?

08:26.000 --> 08:28.000
Shut up.

08:58.000 --> 09:00.000
I'm afraid of you.

09:01.000 --> 09:03.000
I'm afraid of you.

09:05.000 --> 09:07.000
I'm afraid of you.

09:08.000 --> 09:10.000
I'm afraid of you.

09:14.000 --> 09:16.000
Aah!

09:17.000 --> 09:19.000
Oh, my love.

09:20.000 --> 09:22.000
You are my love.

09:23.000 --> 09:25.000
My love.

09:28.000 --> 09:33.000
Too far, too far to move, yeah.
