0	4240	It's no secret that creationist preacher Kent Hovind and I have our differences when
4240	6560	it comes to the theory of evolution.
6560	11360	He says animals can be neatly divided into kinds, defined as those that can bring forth.
11360	15240	See, if they can bring forth, they're the same kind.
15240	17400	Simple definition, can they bring forth?
17400	22440	Which means that no matter how many generations pass, they never change into new kinds, in
22440	25200	other words, animals that can't interbreed.
25200	29440	I cite the evidence showing that animals do change over time to the point where they can
29480	32960	no longer interbreed, thus forming new species.
32960	38520	It's a process called speciation, and it's the very definition of evolution.
38520	42560	Hovind and I are so far apart on this that I'm sorry to say we're no longer speaking
42560	45920	to each other, and I've stopped making prison visits.
45920	49600	But now I've got some important and exciting news.
49600	53520	It seems that we're about to reconcile our beliefs.
53520	58400	I know, hard to fathom, but in the interests of love and harmony, we may have come up with
58400	64680	a mingling of our cerebral juices, if you will, that satisfies us both.
64680	71680	I'm talking about nothing less than a coming together of evolution and creationism.
88400	95400	Not like that.
96640	100480	When I talk about reconciling evolution and creationism, I don't mean I've changed my
100480	102120	position at all.
102120	106200	No, Hovind has, and I didn't even notice it.
106200	110680	So let me tell you how this extraordinary revelation came about.
110680	115120	Last year I did a video on ring species in which I quoted Hovind giving a very clear
115120	116520	definition of a kind.
116520	119880	If they can bring forth, they're the same kind.
119880	120720	Simple definition.
120720	121720	Can they bring forth?
121720	123640	A dog and a wolf can mate and bring forth.
123640	125400	A dog and a banana cannot.
125400	131200	Now see, Charlie Darwin wrote a book called The Origin of Species, and how the Christian
131200	134980	church got lost in the 1800s and didn't catch that, I don't know, but they didn't catch
134980	135960	what's happening.
135960	137760	They're changing the definition.
137760	141160	If they'd have stuck with the word kind, we never would have had this dumb evolution theory
141160	143520	permeating our society.
143520	145040	They bring forth, they're the same kind.
145560	146960	Couldn't be simpler.
146960	151480	And then, of course, I showed how ring species completely stuff up this neat definition.
151480	153640	Same kind, same kind, same kind.
153640	154640	Doh!
154640	156440	We've hit the same problem.
156440	160760	These ones at the end can't be the same kind because they can't interbreed.
160760	165840	Not long afterwards, I got a message from a Hovind fan, shiftplus180, who said I had
165840	169300	misrepresented Hovind's definition of a kind.
169300	174280	He said Hovind accepts that animals change over time because of natural selection.
174520	176720	Yes, that's true, he always has said that.
176720	179400	Hovind calls this microevolution.
179400	184120	But the fan went further, insisting that Hovind also accepts that this change can produce
184120	187320	descendants that can't interbreed.
187320	189960	I told him Hovind can't possibly have admitted that.
189960	193680	I mean, that's the very definition of evolution.
193680	195720	But blow me down, he was right.
195720	198480	He sent me a clip of Hovind debating students at Berkeley.
198480	202680	So Michael says if they can bring forth that it's reproduced, they're the same kind.
203080	207720	It could be that animals have diversified like Alaska rabbits and Florida rabbits can
207720	208720	no longer interbreed.
208720	213520	But they're still obviously the same kind, they could originally interbreed.
213520	216240	I hope you understand what Hovind is saying here.
216240	218960	If they can bring forth, they're the same kind.
218960	222520	This is his simple definition as he's explained it before.
222520	227160	But then he goes on to say that even if they can't bring forth, they can also be the same
227160	231240	kind as long as they have a common ancestor.
231240	235280	I thought Hovind must have been cornered by radical Berkeley biologists.
235280	239880	But when another YouTuber, YouTube Detective, sent me a video he had made criticising my
239880	245840	ring species video, he included yet another Hovind clip containing the same subtle shift
245840	246840	in position.
246840	250600	Natural selection will never change an animal to a new kind of animal, it will only keep
250600	252760	the species strong.
252760	255520	And it might allow the species to adapt to a new environment.
255520	260060	We now have Alaska rabbits that are able to survive in 20 below zero.
260060	263940	And we have Florida rabbits that are able to survive in 100 degrees.
263940	267660	And they are not inter-fertile, they're considered a different subspecies, maybe even a different
267660	269380	species, I don't know.
269380	275660	Now both of those Alaska rabbits and Florida rabbits can breed with Minnesota rabbits.
275660	277660	They're kind of in the middle.
277660	280380	Ok, and they're going to say, see this is evolution.
280380	285020	No, it's a variation and it's still a rabbit.
285020	289020	That doesn't prove it came from a rock folks, that's just a variety, that's all it is.
289020	292340	And that's all that can ever be offered is examples of variation.
292340	296520	Far from being a clip of Hovind I won't show you, I'm delighted to show you this because
296520	300660	once again Hovind amends his definition of a kind.
300660	305040	It's possible Hovind had to make this change when someone pointed out that Florida and
305040	309560	Alaska rabbits can mate with Minnesota rabbits but not with each other.
309560	312620	It's a kind of ring species with open ends.
312620	317140	But in making the change Hovind has opened up a whole new can of worms.
317140	321620	You see if Hovind accepts that a population of rabbits can split into two groups that
321620	327540	evolve, sorry, change over time to the point where they can no longer interbreed, then
327540	332980	he also has to accept that each of these populations can then split into two groups that change
332980	339200	over time to the point where they can no longer interbreed and so on and so on.
339200	345460	So what we end up with is this, a lot of groups each looking very different from the others,
345460	350440	some bigger, some with longer tails, longer snouts, different diets, that can no longer
350440	352260	interbreed.
352260	355020	Now what does this chart remind you of?
355020	357780	If this is not evolution then what is it?
357780	360380	It's a variation and it's still a rabbit.
360380	363460	But evolution is variation.
363460	368060	So let's do a quick checklist of what the theory of evolution actually proposes and
368060	369060	compare.
369060	374360	Hovind thinks a species will change over time as it adapts to new environments and that's
374360	377000	what the theory of evolution says.
377000	379880	Hovind thinks this is because of natural selection.
379880	383200	Well that's what the theory of evolution says.
383200	387400	Hovind thinks this will produce a variety of new populations of animals that can no
387400	388400	longer interbreed.
388400	392400	Yes, that's what the theory of evolution says.
392400	394480	Hovind calls this variation.
394480	398120	The theory of evolution calls it evolution.
398120	403280	And finally Hovind says organisms change but always stay within their own kind.
403280	408840	And the theory of evolution can at last agree since a kind is now defined as an organism
408840	412080	that shares a common ancestry.
412080	416080	So the only thing we're left arguing about is what to call this process.
416080	421000	And since Hovind has come so far in accepting every single facet of the theory of evolution
421000	425420	as described by Charles Darwin, I think I can accommodate him a little by accepting
425420	428040	whatever name he wants to call it.
428040	433920	Because quite frankly, what to call a discovery is far less important than the discovery itself.
433920	438200	And I'm happy to call animals that share a common ancestor a kind if Hovind wants to
438200	444280	call them that, rather than genus, family, order and class as preferred by biologists.
444280	450320	So is there any last loophole that prevents variation from being exactly the same as evolution?
450320	454120	Yes, Hovind has another way to define a kind.
454120	456560	And that is, it's obvious.
456560	461940	So obvious that the acid test for a kind is to get a five year old child to tell you.
461940	467920	Now this seems like such an absurd and unscientific definition, even for Hovind, that you probably
467920	469720	think I'm making it up.
469720	470720	So roll tape.
470720	477720	I think in 99.9% of the cases it would be obvious to a five year old which animals are
477720	478720	the same kind.
478720	483240	And just to show he's right, in another lecture Hovind finds a five year old, well, a six
483240	485600	year old who can do just that.
485600	487320	Is anybody in here five or six years old?
487320	488320	Who's five or six?
488320	490320	How old are you?
490320	491320	Six.
491320	492320	What's your name?
492320	493320	Rachel?
493320	494320	Rachel?
494320	496800	Why don't you take a test here, Rachel?
496800	500800	Here we have a dog, a wolf, a coyote and a banana.
500800	506040	Which one is not like the others?
506040	507040	The banana!
507040	508040	Very good, let's give her a hand.
508040	512320	Now this isn't my test for what defines a kind, it's Hovind's.
512320	514880	So let's apply it.
514880	516840	Which one is not like the others?
516840	520640	Clearly the banana, which makes all the others the same kind, right?
520640	521640	They're all rabbits.
521640	524000	Sorry, no they're not.
524000	526140	This one is a hare.
526140	531160	But that's okay, hares and rabbits share a common ancestor, and they're all laparids.
531160	535600	And since Hovind defines a kind as a population that shares a common ancestor, even though
535600	541120	they can't interbreed, and a five year old thinks a banana is the odd one out, then laparids
541120	543480	are obviously the same kind.
543480	547760	And while we're at it, varieties of pika also share a common ancestor with rabbits
547760	551000	and hares, so they must be the same kind.
551000	556300	Now pika aren't laparids, but pika, rabbits and hares are all lagomorphs.
556300	559060	So they're all the same kind.
559060	562920	Now pika don't exactly look like rabbits, but that doesn't matter.
562920	565880	That's not a criterion for being the same kind.
565880	572120	Hovind shows that himself in this illustration of what variation can do to an animal kind.
572120	573680	And biologists agree.
573680	578280	What an animal looks like is no guide to its genetic heritage.
578280	579860	I'll show you what I mean.
579860	584040	Here we have an echidna, a hedgehog, a porcupine and a banana.
584040	588900	Once again, the banana is not like the others, which a five year old can tell you must mean
588900	591200	that the others are the same kind.
591200	596000	But one's a rodent, one's an insectivore, and the other's a monotreme, which means it
596000	597760	lays eggs.
597760	601720	Even so, they all fulfil Hovind's criteria for being the same kind.
601720	604160	They're all mammals.
604160	608540	Remember I'm going by Hovind's definition of a kind, not mine.
608540	612320	They share a common ancestry, even though they can't interbreed, and they're obviously
612320	616960	the same kind when put up against a banana for the judgement of a five year old.
616960	618160	What about the name?
618160	621600	Maybe if they all have the same name, they're the same kind.
621600	626100	Well Hovind doesn't define a kind that way, and for good reason, because animals don't
626100	629060	come with names, we give them names.
629060	633260	If you want to argue that bears are the same kind because they're all called bears, what
633260	635000	about koala bears?
635000	640180	If they're really bears, then how come they have pouches and other bears don't?
640180	643140	And there's another danger with grouping animals by their names.
643140	647740	If you stick a five year old creationist kid in front of this puzzle, it's likely to cause
647740	653360	some confusion, because obviously the banana is again not like the others, so they must
653360	655300	all be the same kind.
655300	657420	Yes, they're all apes.
657420	660900	Oh dear, you may not like where this is heading.
660900	665420	And if they're all the same kind, they must have a common ancestor.
665420	668260	Quick, get that kid away and send him off to Christian camp.
668260	672140	Oh gosh, creationists are running out of get-out clauses here.
672140	673580	Okay, here's one.
673580	677780	Animals can evolve, sorry, change over time into new varieties, but there's a limit on
677780	681860	how far that evolu- sorry, that variation can go.
681860	684220	Okay, what's the limit?
684220	689400	If one population of animals can divide into two, and each of those can divide into two,
689400	693260	and each of those can divide into two, what's the limiting factor?
693260	697260	Does natural selection suddenly stop working after a certain number of species have been
697260	698260	produced?
698260	702420	As long as they're all defined as the same kind, no creationist seems to have imposed
702420	704520	any limit.
704520	708740	After discovering Hovind's change of definition, I soon began to find other creationists accepting
708740	713420	speciation even in websites like Answers in Genesis.
713660	718740	Areas to reproduction do seem to arise among varieties that once interbred.
718740	722860	But again, Gary Parker doesn't like to call this evolution.
722860	724100	How does he get out of it?
724100	730300	Well, he explains, any real evolution, macroevolution, requires an expansion of the gene pool, the
730300	732740	addition of new genes and new traits.
732740	736500	Well, that's not any definition of evolution I've ever heard of.
736500	740820	And in fact, biology textbooks are full of examples of organisms that lose traits as
740820	741940	they evolve.
741940	747260	The ancestors of whales once had feet, the ancestors of penguins could fly, the ancestors
747260	751240	of moles could see, and the ancestors of chickens had teeth.
751240	753940	And at the same time, they gain new traits.
753940	758040	Whales can hold their breath underwater, penguins are protected against the cold, moles have
758040	760020	powerful claws for digging.
760020	762300	All of this is evolution.
762300	767000	Evolution is defined in most biology textbooks as a change in the gene pool, a change in
767000	772560	features and traits, and a change or a modification of an organism's characteristics.
772560	776760	Parker is trying to make up his own definition of evolution, simply because the accepted
776760	782960	definition is uncomfortably close to his view of how animals change over time.
782960	787640	But the problem with trying to shift the goalposts like this is that his own new theory of speciation
787640	790080	automatically moves with them.
790080	794600	Because whatever arguments he uses to show that animals can't change into new species
794600	801240	automatically negates his own theory that animals can change into new species.
801240	805240	Let's take Parker's main argument against evolution as an example.
805240	811260	Each variety resulting from reproductive isolation has a smaller gene pool than the original.
811260	815060	What he's saying quite correctly is that evolution works like this.
815060	819440	A population of animals separates geographically into two groups.
819440	823500	According to the theory of evolution, each will change over time.
823500	828300	One group might move into a cold environment and grow thick fur and a mechanism for preventing
828300	829660	frostbite.
829660	833700	Another group might live in a wooded environment and adapt to climbing trees.
833700	839780	A third group might adapt to tropical wetlands and change its diet to crabs and insects.
839780	845260	Now Parker argues that evolution isn't possible because as each population splits, each new
845260	850060	subgroup will have a smaller gene pool than the original large group.
850060	854380	Instead, he proposes a different model of speciation.
854380	858460	A population of animals separates geographically into two groups.
858460	862320	According to Parker's idea, each will change over time.
862320	866820	One group might move into a cold environment and grow thick fur and a mechanism for preventing
866820	867980	frostbite.
867980	872060	Another group might live in a wooded environment and adapt to climbing trees.
872060	877340	A third group might adapt to tropical wetlands and change its diet to crabs and insects.
877340	880620	This is exactly the same as the theory of evolution.
880620	885420	But according to Parker, evolution can't happen because each separated population has a smaller
885420	886940	gene pool.
886940	892420	And yet, according to Parker, speciation can happen under exactly the same circumstances
892420	896420	using exactly the same mechanism of natural selection.
896420	901660	So as long as we don't call it evolution, creationists accept that animals can evolve.
901660	904620	Oh damn, I mean change.
904620	908640	And Hovind agrees, as long as we call it variation.
908640	913500	Because if we switch from a hypothetical to a real example, Hovind says that canids, or
913500	918380	dogs as he calls them, all came from a common ancestor, producing wolves that can survive
918380	923400	in arctic conditions, foxes that can climb trees in North American forests, and foxes
923400	927780	that live in South American swamplands eating crabs and insects.
927780	932780	Since Parker argues that this kind of change or variation happens, we can't really take
932780	937120	him seriously when he gives reasons as to why it can't happen.
937120	939740	And here's someone else who accepts that it happens.
939740	943620	Since two dogs walked off the ark, then as the population of dogs increased, eventually
943620	946860	the population would split up and different groups would form.
946860	951580	As the gene pool was split up, different combinations of genes, inherited from the original dogs,
951580	952900	would end up in different groups.
952900	957380	Thus different species would form, such as dingoes, wolves, and so on.
957380	961660	Now evolutionists have always insisted that such a process happens slowly, and therefore
961660	965060	the Bible can't be right when it says the land animals came off the ark only four and
965060	966860	a half thousand years ago.
966860	972960	It's interesting that the only difference Ken Ham can find with evolution is the timescale.
972960	977820	Now I've always known that Ken Ham, like other creationists, accepted natural selection.
977820	982160	The evolution of the horse is explained right there in his creation museum.
982160	985860	Of course it's not called evolution, it's called development.
985860	989400	Boy they really think it's all about what you call something, don't they?
989400	994180	But the diagram doesn't show the horse evolving or developing into different species that
994180	995760	can't interbreed.
995760	1000160	And for the most part, creationist preachers won't tell you this unless someone specifically
1000160	1003680	brings up the issue of ring species or rabbits.
1003680	1007320	So now you have two different ways to confuse a creationist.
1007320	1011560	If they don't accept that animals change into new species that can't interbreed, show them
1011560	1013840	the example of ring species.
1013840	1018720	And if they do accept it, then ask them how this is different to evolution.
1018720	1022720	But isn't it nice after all these years to know that creationists are finally accepting
1022720	1027200	evolution or change or variety or whatever they want to call it, and it's so nice to
1027200	1030200	come together.
1030200	1031000	Not like that!
