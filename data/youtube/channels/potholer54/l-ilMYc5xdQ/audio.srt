1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,240
It's no secret that creationist preacher Kent Hovind and I have our differences when

2
00:00:04,240 --> 00:00:06,560
it comes to the theory of evolution.

3
00:00:06,560 --> 00:00:11,360
He says animals can be neatly divided into kinds, defined as those that can bring forth.

4
00:00:11,360 --> 00:00:15,240
See, if they can bring forth, they're the same kind.

5
00:00:15,240 --> 00:00:17,400
Simple definition, can they bring forth?

6
00:00:17,400 --> 00:00:22,440
Which means that no matter how many generations pass, they never change into new kinds, in

7
00:00:22,440 --> 00:00:25,200
other words, animals that can't interbreed.

8
00:00:25,200 --> 00:00:29,440
I cite the evidence showing that animals do change over time to the point where they can

9
00:00:29,480 --> 00:00:32,960
no longer interbreed, thus forming new species.

10
00:00:32,960 --> 00:00:38,520
It's a process called speciation, and it's the very definition of evolution.

11
00:00:38,520 --> 00:00:42,560
Hovind and I are so far apart on this that I'm sorry to say we're no longer speaking

12
00:00:42,560 --> 00:00:45,920
to each other, and I've stopped making prison visits.

13
00:00:45,920 --> 00:00:49,600
But now I've got some important and exciting news.

14
00:00:49,600 --> 00:00:53,520
It seems that we're about to reconcile our beliefs.

15
00:00:53,520 --> 00:00:58,400
I know, hard to fathom, but in the interests of love and harmony, we may have come up with

16
00:00:58,400 --> 00:01:04,680
a mingling of our cerebral juices, if you will, that satisfies us both.

17
00:01:04,680 --> 00:01:11,680
I'm talking about nothing less than a coming together of evolution and creationism.

18
00:01:28,400 --> 00:01:35,400
Not like that.

19
00:01:36,640 --> 00:01:40,480
When I talk about reconciling evolution and creationism, I don't mean I've changed my

20
00:01:40,480 --> 00:01:42,120
position at all.

21
00:01:42,120 --> 00:01:46,200
No, Hovind has, and I didn't even notice it.

22
00:01:46,200 --> 00:01:50,680
So let me tell you how this extraordinary revelation came about.

23
00:01:50,680 --> 00:01:55,120
Last year I did a video on ring species in which I quoted Hovind giving a very clear

24
00:01:55,120 --> 00:01:56,520
definition of a kind.

25
00:01:56,520 --> 00:01:59,880
If they can bring forth, they're the same kind.

26
00:01:59,880 --> 00:02:00,720
Simple definition.

27
00:02:00,720 --> 00:02:01,720
Can they bring forth?

28
00:02:01,720 --> 00:02:03,640
A dog and a wolf can mate and bring forth.

29
00:02:03,640 --> 00:02:05,400
A dog and a banana cannot.

30
00:02:05,400 --> 00:02:11,200
Now see, Charlie Darwin wrote a book called The Origin of Species, and how the Christian

31
00:02:11,200 --> 00:02:14,980
church got lost in the 1800s and didn't catch that, I don't know, but they didn't catch

32
00:02:14,980 --> 00:02:15,960
what's happening.

33
00:02:15,960 --> 00:02:17,760
They're changing the definition.

34
00:02:17,760 --> 00:02:21,160
If they'd have stuck with the word kind, we never would have had this dumb evolution theory

35
00:02:21,160 --> 00:02:23,520
permeating our society.

36
00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:25,040
They bring forth, they're the same kind.

37
00:02:25,560 --> 00:02:26,960
Couldn't be simpler.

38
00:02:26,960 --> 00:02:31,480
And then, of course, I showed how ring species completely stuff up this neat definition.

39
00:02:31,480 --> 00:02:33,640
Same kind, same kind, same kind.

40
00:02:33,640 --> 00:02:34,640
Doh!

41
00:02:34,640 --> 00:02:36,440
We've hit the same problem.

42
00:02:36,440 --> 00:02:40,760
These ones at the end can't be the same kind because they can't interbreed.

43
00:02:40,760 --> 00:02:45,840
Not long afterwards, I got a message from a Hovind fan, shiftplus180, who said I had

44
00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:49,300
misrepresented Hovind's definition of a kind.

45
00:02:49,300 --> 00:02:54,280
He said Hovind accepts that animals change over time because of natural selection.

46
00:02:54,520 --> 00:02:56,720
Yes, that's true, he always has said that.

47
00:02:56,720 --> 00:02:59,400
Hovind calls this microevolution.

48
00:02:59,400 --> 00:03:04,120
But the fan went further, insisting that Hovind also accepts that this change can produce

49
00:03:04,120 --> 00:03:07,320
descendants that can't interbreed.

50
00:03:07,320 --> 00:03:09,960
I told him Hovind can't possibly have admitted that.

51
00:03:09,960 --> 00:03:13,680
I mean, that's the very definition of evolution.

52
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:15,720
But blow me down, he was right.

53
00:03:15,720 --> 00:03:18,480
He sent me a clip of Hovind debating students at Berkeley.

54
00:03:18,480 --> 00:03:22,680
So Michael says if they can bring forth that it's reproduced, they're the same kind.

55
00:03:23,080 --> 00:03:27,720
It could be that animals have diversified like Alaska rabbits and Florida rabbits can

56
00:03:27,720 --> 00:03:28,720
no longer interbreed.

57
00:03:28,720 --> 00:03:33,520
But they're still obviously the same kind, they could originally interbreed.

58
00:03:33,520 --> 00:03:36,240
I hope you understand what Hovind is saying here.

59
00:03:36,240 --> 00:03:38,960
If they can bring forth, they're the same kind.

60
00:03:38,960 --> 00:03:42,520
This is his simple definition as he's explained it before.

61
00:03:42,520 --> 00:03:47,160
But then he goes on to say that even if they can't bring forth, they can also be the same

62
00:03:47,160 --> 00:03:51,240
kind as long as they have a common ancestor.

63
00:03:51,240 --> 00:03:55,280
I thought Hovind must have been cornered by radical Berkeley biologists.

64
00:03:55,280 --> 00:03:59,880
But when another YouTuber, YouTube Detective, sent me a video he had made criticising my

65
00:03:59,880 --> 00:04:05,840
ring species video, he included yet another Hovind clip containing the same subtle shift

66
00:04:05,840 --> 00:04:06,840
in position.

67
00:04:06,840 --> 00:04:10,600
Natural selection will never change an animal to a new kind of animal, it will only keep

68
00:04:10,600 --> 00:04:12,760
the species strong.

69
00:04:12,760 --> 00:04:15,520
And it might allow the species to adapt to a new environment.

70
00:04:15,520 --> 00:04:20,060
We now have Alaska rabbits that are able to survive in 20 below zero.

71
00:04:20,060 --> 00:04:23,940
And we have Florida rabbits that are able to survive in 100 degrees.

72
00:04:23,940 --> 00:04:27,660
And they are not inter-fertile, they're considered a different subspecies, maybe even a different

73
00:04:27,660 --> 00:04:29,380
species, I don't know.

74
00:04:29,380 --> 00:04:35,660
Now both of those Alaska rabbits and Florida rabbits can breed with Minnesota rabbits.

75
00:04:35,660 --> 00:04:37,660
They're kind of in the middle.

76
00:04:37,660 --> 00:04:40,380
Ok, and they're going to say, see this is evolution.

77
00:04:40,380 --> 00:04:45,020
No, it's a variation and it's still a rabbit.

78
00:04:45,020 --> 00:04:49,020
That doesn't prove it came from a rock folks, that's just a variety, that's all it is.

79
00:04:49,020 --> 00:04:52,340
And that's all that can ever be offered is examples of variation.

80
00:04:52,340 --> 00:04:56,520
Far from being a clip of Hovind I won't show you, I'm delighted to show you this because

81
00:04:56,520 --> 00:05:00,660
once again Hovind amends his definition of a kind.

82
00:05:00,660 --> 00:05:05,040
It's possible Hovind had to make this change when someone pointed out that Florida and

83
00:05:05,040 --> 00:05:09,560
Alaska rabbits can mate with Minnesota rabbits but not with each other.

84
00:05:09,560 --> 00:05:12,620
It's a kind of ring species with open ends.

85
00:05:12,620 --> 00:05:17,140
But in making the change Hovind has opened up a whole new can of worms.

86
00:05:17,140 --> 00:05:21,620
You see if Hovind accepts that a population of rabbits can split into two groups that

87
00:05:21,620 --> 00:05:27,540
evolve, sorry, change over time to the point where they can no longer interbreed, then

88
00:05:27,540 --> 00:05:32,980
he also has to accept that each of these populations can then split into two groups that change

89
00:05:32,980 --> 00:05:39,200
over time to the point where they can no longer interbreed and so on and so on.

90
00:05:39,200 --> 00:05:45,460
So what we end up with is this, a lot of groups each looking very different from the others,

91
00:05:45,460 --> 00:05:50,440
some bigger, some with longer tails, longer snouts, different diets, that can no longer

92
00:05:50,440 --> 00:05:52,260
interbreed.

93
00:05:52,260 --> 00:05:55,020
Now what does this chart remind you of?

94
00:05:55,020 --> 00:05:57,780
If this is not evolution then what is it?

95
00:05:57,780 --> 00:06:00,380
It's a variation and it's still a rabbit.

96
00:06:00,380 --> 00:06:03,460
But evolution is variation.

97
00:06:03,460 --> 00:06:08,060
So let's do a quick checklist of what the theory of evolution actually proposes and

98
00:06:08,060 --> 00:06:09,060
compare.

99
00:06:09,060 --> 00:06:14,360
Hovind thinks a species will change over time as it adapts to new environments and that's

100
00:06:14,360 --> 00:06:17,000
what the theory of evolution says.

101
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:19,880
Hovind thinks this is because of natural selection.

102
00:06:19,880 --> 00:06:23,200
Well that's what the theory of evolution says.

103
00:06:23,200 --> 00:06:27,400
Hovind thinks this will produce a variety of new populations of animals that can no

104
00:06:27,400 --> 00:06:28,400
longer interbreed.

105
00:06:28,400 --> 00:06:32,400
Yes, that's what the theory of evolution says.

106
00:06:32,400 --> 00:06:34,480
Hovind calls this variation.

107
00:06:34,480 --> 00:06:38,120
The theory of evolution calls it evolution.

108
00:06:38,120 --> 00:06:43,280
And finally Hovind says organisms change but always stay within their own kind.

109
00:06:43,280 --> 00:06:48,840
And the theory of evolution can at last agree since a kind is now defined as an organism

110
00:06:48,840 --> 00:06:52,080
that shares a common ancestry.

111
00:06:52,080 --> 00:06:56,080
So the only thing we're left arguing about is what to call this process.

112
00:06:56,080 --> 00:07:01,000
And since Hovind has come so far in accepting every single facet of the theory of evolution

113
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:05,420
as described by Charles Darwin, I think I can accommodate him a little by accepting

114
00:07:05,420 --> 00:07:08,040
whatever name he wants to call it.

115
00:07:08,040 --> 00:07:13,920
Because quite frankly, what to call a discovery is far less important than the discovery itself.

116
00:07:13,920 --> 00:07:18,200
And I'm happy to call animals that share a common ancestor a kind if Hovind wants to

117
00:07:18,200 --> 00:07:24,280
call them that, rather than genus, family, order and class as preferred by biologists.

118
00:07:24,280 --> 00:07:30,320
So is there any last loophole that prevents variation from being exactly the same as evolution?

119
00:07:30,320 --> 00:07:34,120
Yes, Hovind has another way to define a kind.

120
00:07:34,120 --> 00:07:36,560
And that is, it's obvious.

121
00:07:36,560 --> 00:07:41,940
So obvious that the acid test for a kind is to get a five year old child to tell you.

122
00:07:41,940 --> 00:07:47,920
Now this seems like such an absurd and unscientific definition, even for Hovind, that you probably

123
00:07:47,920 --> 00:07:49,720
think I'm making it up.

124
00:07:49,720 --> 00:07:50,720
So roll tape.

125
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:57,720
I think in 99.9% of the cases it would be obvious to a five year old which animals are

126
00:07:57,720 --> 00:07:58,720
the same kind.

127
00:07:58,720 --> 00:08:03,240
And just to show he's right, in another lecture Hovind finds a five year old, well, a six

128
00:08:03,240 --> 00:08:05,600
year old who can do just that.

129
00:08:05,600 --> 00:08:07,320
Is anybody in here five or six years old?

130
00:08:07,320 --> 00:08:08,320
Who's five or six?

131
00:08:08,320 --> 00:08:10,320
How old are you?

132
00:08:10,320 --> 00:08:11,320
Six.

133
00:08:11,320 --> 00:08:12,320
What's your name?

134
00:08:12,320 --> 00:08:13,320
Rachel?

135
00:08:13,320 --> 00:08:14,320
Rachel?

136
00:08:14,320 --> 00:08:16,800
Why don't you take a test here, Rachel?

137
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:20,800
Here we have a dog, a wolf, a coyote and a banana.

138
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:26,040
Which one is not like the others?

139
00:08:26,040 --> 00:08:27,040
The banana!

140
00:08:27,040 --> 00:08:28,040
Very good, let's give her a hand.

141
00:08:28,040 --> 00:08:32,320
Now this isn't my test for what defines a kind, it's Hovind's.

142
00:08:32,320 --> 00:08:34,880
So let's apply it.

143
00:08:34,880 --> 00:08:36,840
Which one is not like the others?

144
00:08:36,840 --> 00:08:40,640
Clearly the banana, which makes all the others the same kind, right?

145
00:08:40,640 --> 00:08:41,640
They're all rabbits.

146
00:08:41,640 --> 00:08:44,000
Sorry, no they're not.

147
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:46,140
This one is a hare.

148
00:08:46,140 --> 00:08:51,160
But that's okay, hares and rabbits share a common ancestor, and they're all laparids.

149
00:08:51,160 --> 00:08:55,600
And since Hovind defines a kind as a population that shares a common ancestor, even though

150
00:08:55,600 --> 00:09:01,120
they can't interbreed, and a five year old thinks a banana is the odd one out, then laparids

151
00:09:01,120 --> 00:09:03,480
are obviously the same kind.

152
00:09:03,480 --> 00:09:07,760
And while we're at it, varieties of pika also share a common ancestor with rabbits

153
00:09:07,760 --> 00:09:11,000
and hares, so they must be the same kind.

154
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:16,300
Now pika aren't laparids, but pika, rabbits and hares are all lagomorphs.

155
00:09:16,300 --> 00:09:19,060
So they're all the same kind.

156
00:09:19,060 --> 00:09:22,920
Now pika don't exactly look like rabbits, but that doesn't matter.

157
00:09:22,920 --> 00:09:25,880
That's not a criterion for being the same kind.

158
00:09:25,880 --> 00:09:32,120
Hovind shows that himself in this illustration of what variation can do to an animal kind.

159
00:09:32,120 --> 00:09:33,680
And biologists agree.

160
00:09:33,680 --> 00:09:38,280
What an animal looks like is no guide to its genetic heritage.

161
00:09:38,280 --> 00:09:39,860
I'll show you what I mean.

162
00:09:39,860 --> 00:09:44,040
Here we have an echidna, a hedgehog, a porcupine and a banana.

163
00:09:44,040 --> 00:09:48,900
Once again, the banana is not like the others, which a five year old can tell you must mean

164
00:09:48,900 --> 00:09:51,200
that the others are the same kind.

165
00:09:51,200 --> 00:09:56,000
But one's a rodent, one's an insectivore, and the other's a monotreme, which means it

166
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:57,760
lays eggs.

167
00:09:57,760 --> 00:10:01,720
Even so, they all fulfil Hovind's criteria for being the same kind.

168
00:10:01,720 --> 00:10:04,160
They're all mammals.

169
00:10:04,160 --> 00:10:08,540
Remember I'm going by Hovind's definition of a kind, not mine.

170
00:10:08,540 --> 00:10:12,320
They share a common ancestry, even though they can't interbreed, and they're obviously

171
00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:16,960
the same kind when put up against a banana for the judgement of a five year old.

172
00:10:16,960 --> 00:10:18,160
What about the name?

173
00:10:18,160 --> 00:10:21,600
Maybe if they all have the same name, they're the same kind.

174
00:10:21,600 --> 00:10:26,100
Well Hovind doesn't define a kind that way, and for good reason, because animals don't

175
00:10:26,100 --> 00:10:29,060
come with names, we give them names.

176
00:10:29,060 --> 00:10:33,260
If you want to argue that bears are the same kind because they're all called bears, what

177
00:10:33,260 --> 00:10:35,000
about koala bears?

178
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:40,180
If they're really bears, then how come they have pouches and other bears don't?

179
00:10:40,180 --> 00:10:43,140
And there's another danger with grouping animals by their names.

180
00:10:43,140 --> 00:10:47,740
If you stick a five year old creationist kid in front of this puzzle, it's likely to cause

181
00:10:47,740 --> 00:10:53,360
some confusion, because obviously the banana is again not like the others, so they must

182
00:10:53,360 --> 00:10:55,300
all be the same kind.

183
00:10:55,300 --> 00:10:57,420
Yes, they're all apes.

184
00:10:57,420 --> 00:11:00,900
Oh dear, you may not like where this is heading.

185
00:11:00,900 --> 00:11:05,420
And if they're all the same kind, they must have a common ancestor.

186
00:11:05,420 --> 00:11:08,260
Quick, get that kid away and send him off to Christian camp.

187
00:11:08,260 --> 00:11:12,140
Oh gosh, creationists are running out of get-out clauses here.

188
00:11:12,140 --> 00:11:13,580
Okay, here's one.

189
00:11:13,580 --> 00:11:17,780
Animals can evolve, sorry, change over time into new varieties, but there's a limit on

190
00:11:17,780 --> 00:11:21,860
how far that evolu- sorry, that variation can go.

191
00:11:21,860 --> 00:11:24,220
Okay, what's the limit?

192
00:11:24,220 --> 00:11:29,400
If one population of animals can divide into two, and each of those can divide into two,

193
00:11:29,400 --> 00:11:33,260
and each of those can divide into two, what's the limiting factor?

194
00:11:33,260 --> 00:11:37,260
Does natural selection suddenly stop working after a certain number of species have been

195
00:11:37,260 --> 00:11:38,260
produced?

196
00:11:38,260 --> 00:11:42,420
As long as they're all defined as the same kind, no creationist seems to have imposed

197
00:11:42,420 --> 00:11:44,520
any limit.

198
00:11:44,520 --> 00:11:48,740
After discovering Hovind's change of definition, I soon began to find other creationists accepting

199
00:11:48,740 --> 00:11:53,420
speciation even in websites like Answers in Genesis.

200
00:11:53,660 --> 00:11:58,740
Areas to reproduction do seem to arise among varieties that once interbred.

201
00:11:58,740 --> 00:12:02,860
But again, Gary Parker doesn't like to call this evolution.

202
00:12:02,860 --> 00:12:04,100
How does he get out of it?

203
00:12:04,100 --> 00:12:10,300
Well, he explains, any real evolution, macroevolution, requires an expansion of the gene pool, the

204
00:12:10,300 --> 00:12:12,740
addition of new genes and new traits.

205
00:12:12,740 --> 00:12:16,500
Well, that's not any definition of evolution I've ever heard of.

206
00:12:16,500 --> 00:12:20,820
And in fact, biology textbooks are full of examples of organisms that lose traits as

207
00:12:20,820 --> 00:12:21,940
they evolve.

208
00:12:21,940 --> 00:12:27,260
The ancestors of whales once had feet, the ancestors of penguins could fly, the ancestors

209
00:12:27,260 --> 00:12:31,240
of moles could see, and the ancestors of chickens had teeth.

210
00:12:31,240 --> 00:12:33,940
And at the same time, they gain new traits.

211
00:12:33,940 --> 00:12:38,040
Whales can hold their breath underwater, penguins are protected against the cold, moles have

212
00:12:38,040 --> 00:12:40,020
powerful claws for digging.

213
00:12:40,020 --> 00:12:42,300
All of this is evolution.

214
00:12:42,300 --> 00:12:47,000
Evolution is defined in most biology textbooks as a change in the gene pool, a change in

215
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:52,560
features and traits, and a change or a modification of an organism's characteristics.

216
00:12:52,560 --> 00:12:56,760
Parker is trying to make up his own definition of evolution, simply because the accepted

217
00:12:56,760 --> 00:13:02,960
definition is uncomfortably close to his view of how animals change over time.

218
00:13:02,960 --> 00:13:07,640
But the problem with trying to shift the goalposts like this is that his own new theory of speciation

219
00:13:07,640 --> 00:13:10,080
automatically moves with them.

220
00:13:10,080 --> 00:13:14,600
Because whatever arguments he uses to show that animals can't change into new species

221
00:13:14,600 --> 00:13:21,240
automatically negates his own theory that animals can change into new species.

222
00:13:21,240 --> 00:13:25,240
Let's take Parker's main argument against evolution as an example.

223
00:13:25,240 --> 00:13:31,260
Each variety resulting from reproductive isolation has a smaller gene pool than the original.

224
00:13:31,260 --> 00:13:35,060
What he's saying quite correctly is that evolution works like this.

225
00:13:35,060 --> 00:13:39,440
A population of animals separates geographically into two groups.

226
00:13:39,440 --> 00:13:43,500
According to the theory of evolution, each will change over time.

227
00:13:43,500 --> 00:13:48,300
One group might move into a cold environment and grow thick fur and a mechanism for preventing

228
00:13:48,300 --> 00:13:49,660
frostbite.

229
00:13:49,660 --> 00:13:53,700
Another group might live in a wooded environment and adapt to climbing trees.

230
00:13:53,700 --> 00:13:59,780
A third group might adapt to tropical wetlands and change its diet to crabs and insects.

231
00:13:59,780 --> 00:14:05,260
Now Parker argues that evolution isn't possible because as each population splits, each new

232
00:14:05,260 --> 00:14:10,060
subgroup will have a smaller gene pool than the original large group.

233
00:14:10,060 --> 00:14:14,380
Instead, he proposes a different model of speciation.

234
00:14:14,380 --> 00:14:18,460
A population of animals separates geographically into two groups.

235
00:14:18,460 --> 00:14:22,320
According to Parker's idea, each will change over time.

236
00:14:22,320 --> 00:14:26,820
One group might move into a cold environment and grow thick fur and a mechanism for preventing

237
00:14:26,820 --> 00:14:27,980
frostbite.

238
00:14:27,980 --> 00:14:32,060
Another group might live in a wooded environment and adapt to climbing trees.

239
00:14:32,060 --> 00:14:37,340
A third group might adapt to tropical wetlands and change its diet to crabs and insects.

240
00:14:37,340 --> 00:14:40,620
This is exactly the same as the theory of evolution.

241
00:14:40,620 --> 00:14:45,420
But according to Parker, evolution can't happen because each separated population has a smaller

242
00:14:45,420 --> 00:14:46,940
gene pool.

243
00:14:46,940 --> 00:14:52,420
And yet, according to Parker, speciation can happen under exactly the same circumstances

244
00:14:52,420 --> 00:14:56,420
using exactly the same mechanism of natural selection.

245
00:14:56,420 --> 00:15:01,660
So as long as we don't call it evolution, creationists accept that animals can evolve.

246
00:15:01,660 --> 00:15:04,620
Oh damn, I mean change.

247
00:15:04,620 --> 00:15:08,640
And Hovind agrees, as long as we call it variation.

248
00:15:08,640 --> 00:15:13,500
Because if we switch from a hypothetical to a real example, Hovind says that canids, or

249
00:15:13,500 --> 00:15:18,380
dogs as he calls them, all came from a common ancestor, producing wolves that can survive

250
00:15:18,380 --> 00:15:23,400
in arctic conditions, foxes that can climb trees in North American forests, and foxes

251
00:15:23,400 --> 00:15:27,780
that live in South American swamplands eating crabs and insects.

252
00:15:27,780 --> 00:15:32,780
Since Parker argues that this kind of change or variation happens, we can't really take

253
00:15:32,780 --> 00:15:37,120
him seriously when he gives reasons as to why it can't happen.

254
00:15:37,120 --> 00:15:39,740
And here's someone else who accepts that it happens.

255
00:15:39,740 --> 00:15:43,620
Since two dogs walked off the ark, then as the population of dogs increased, eventually

256
00:15:43,620 --> 00:15:46,860
the population would split up and different groups would form.

257
00:15:46,860 --> 00:15:51,580
As the gene pool was split up, different combinations of genes, inherited from the original dogs,

258
00:15:51,580 --> 00:15:52,900
would end up in different groups.

259
00:15:52,900 --> 00:15:57,380
Thus different species would form, such as dingoes, wolves, and so on.

260
00:15:57,380 --> 00:16:01,660
Now evolutionists have always insisted that such a process happens slowly, and therefore

261
00:16:01,660 --> 00:16:05,060
the Bible can't be right when it says the land animals came off the ark only four and

262
00:16:05,060 --> 00:16:06,860
a half thousand years ago.

263
00:16:06,860 --> 00:16:12,960
It's interesting that the only difference Ken Ham can find with evolution is the timescale.

264
00:16:12,960 --> 00:16:17,820
Now I've always known that Ken Ham, like other creationists, accepted natural selection.

265
00:16:17,820 --> 00:16:22,160
The evolution of the horse is explained right there in his creation museum.

266
00:16:22,160 --> 00:16:25,860
Of course it's not called evolution, it's called development.

267
00:16:25,860 --> 00:16:29,400
Boy they really think it's all about what you call something, don't they?

268
00:16:29,400 --> 00:16:34,180
But the diagram doesn't show the horse evolving or developing into different species that

269
00:16:34,180 --> 00:16:35,760
can't interbreed.

270
00:16:35,760 --> 00:16:40,160
And for the most part, creationist preachers won't tell you this unless someone specifically

271
00:16:40,160 --> 00:16:43,680
brings up the issue of ring species or rabbits.

272
00:16:43,680 --> 00:16:47,320
So now you have two different ways to confuse a creationist.

273
00:16:47,320 --> 00:16:51,560
If they don't accept that animals change into new species that can't interbreed, show them

274
00:16:51,560 --> 00:16:53,840
the example of ring species.

275
00:16:53,840 --> 00:16:58,720
And if they do accept it, then ask them how this is different to evolution.

276
00:16:58,720 --> 00:17:02,720
But isn't it nice after all these years to know that creationists are finally accepting

277
00:17:02,720 --> 00:17:07,200
evolution or change or variety or whatever they want to call it, and it's so nice to

278
00:17:07,200 --> 00:17:10,200
come together.

279
00:17:10,200 --> 00:17:11,000
Not like that!
