00:00.000 --> 00:04.240
It's no secret that creationist preacher Kent Hovind and I have our differences when

00:04.240 --> 00:06.560
it comes to the theory of evolution.

00:06.560 --> 00:11.360
He says animals can be neatly divided into kinds, defined as those that can bring forth.

00:11.360 --> 00:15.240
See, if they can bring forth, they're the same kind.

00:15.240 --> 00:17.400
Simple definition, can they bring forth?

00:17.400 --> 00:22.440
Which means that no matter how many generations pass, they never change into new kinds, in

00:22.440 --> 00:25.200
other words, animals that can't interbreed.

00:25.200 --> 00:29.440
I cite the evidence showing that animals do change over time to the point where they can

00:29.480 --> 00:32.960
no longer interbreed, thus forming new species.

00:32.960 --> 00:38.520
It's a process called speciation, and it's the very definition of evolution.

00:38.520 --> 00:42.560
Hovind and I are so far apart on this that I'm sorry to say we're no longer speaking

00:42.560 --> 00:45.920
to each other, and I've stopped making prison visits.

00:45.920 --> 00:49.600
But now I've got some important and exciting news.

00:49.600 --> 00:53.520
It seems that we're about to reconcile our beliefs.

00:53.520 --> 00:58.400
I know, hard to fathom, but in the interests of love and harmony, we may have come up with

00:58.400 --> 01:04.680
a mingling of our cerebral juices, if you will, that satisfies us both.

01:04.680 --> 01:11.680
I'm talking about nothing less than a coming together of evolution and creationism.

01:28.400 --> 01:35.400
Not like that.

01:36.640 --> 01:40.480
When I talk about reconciling evolution and creationism, I don't mean I've changed my

01:40.480 --> 01:42.120
position at all.

01:42.120 --> 01:46.200
No, Hovind has, and I didn't even notice it.

01:46.200 --> 01:50.680
So let me tell you how this extraordinary revelation came about.

01:50.680 --> 01:55.120
Last year I did a video on ring species in which I quoted Hovind giving a very clear

01:55.120 --> 01:56.520
definition of a kind.

01:56.520 --> 01:59.880
If they can bring forth, they're the same kind.

01:59.880 --> 02:00.720
Simple definition.

02:00.720 --> 02:01.720
Can they bring forth?

02:01.720 --> 02:03.640
A dog and a wolf can mate and bring forth.

02:03.640 --> 02:05.400
A dog and a banana cannot.

02:05.400 --> 02:11.200
Now see, Charlie Darwin wrote a book called The Origin of Species, and how the Christian

02:11.200 --> 02:14.980
church got lost in the 1800s and didn't catch that, I don't know, but they didn't catch

02:14.980 --> 02:15.960
what's happening.

02:15.960 --> 02:17.760
They're changing the definition.

02:17.760 --> 02:21.160
If they'd have stuck with the word kind, we never would have had this dumb evolution theory

02:21.160 --> 02:23.520
permeating our society.

02:23.520 --> 02:25.040
They bring forth, they're the same kind.

02:25.560 --> 02:26.960
Couldn't be simpler.

02:26.960 --> 02:31.480
And then, of course, I showed how ring species completely stuff up this neat definition.

02:31.480 --> 02:33.640
Same kind, same kind, same kind.

02:33.640 --> 02:34.640
Doh!

02:34.640 --> 02:36.440
We've hit the same problem.

02:36.440 --> 02:40.760
These ones at the end can't be the same kind because they can't interbreed.

02:40.760 --> 02:45.840
Not long afterwards, I got a message from a Hovind fan, shiftplus180, who said I had

02:45.840 --> 02:49.300
misrepresented Hovind's definition of a kind.

02:49.300 --> 02:54.280
He said Hovind accepts that animals change over time because of natural selection.

02:54.520 --> 02:56.720
Yes, that's true, he always has said that.

02:56.720 --> 02:59.400
Hovind calls this microevolution.

02:59.400 --> 03:04.120
But the fan went further, insisting that Hovind also accepts that this change can produce

03:04.120 --> 03:07.320
descendants that can't interbreed.

03:07.320 --> 03:09.960
I told him Hovind can't possibly have admitted that.

03:09.960 --> 03:13.680
I mean, that's the very definition of evolution.

03:13.680 --> 03:15.720
But blow me down, he was right.

03:15.720 --> 03:18.480
He sent me a clip of Hovind debating students at Berkeley.

03:18.480 --> 03:22.680
So Michael says if they can bring forth that it's reproduced, they're the same kind.

03:23.080 --> 03:27.720
It could be that animals have diversified like Alaska rabbits and Florida rabbits can

03:27.720 --> 03:28.720
no longer interbreed.

03:28.720 --> 03:33.520
But they're still obviously the same kind, they could originally interbreed.

03:33.520 --> 03:36.240
I hope you understand what Hovind is saying here.

03:36.240 --> 03:38.960
If they can bring forth, they're the same kind.

03:38.960 --> 03:42.520
This is his simple definition as he's explained it before.

03:42.520 --> 03:47.160
But then he goes on to say that even if they can't bring forth, they can also be the same

03:47.160 --> 03:51.240
kind as long as they have a common ancestor.

03:51.240 --> 03:55.280
I thought Hovind must have been cornered by radical Berkeley biologists.

03:55.280 --> 03:59.880
But when another YouTuber, YouTube Detective, sent me a video he had made criticising my

03:59.880 --> 04:05.840
ring species video, he included yet another Hovind clip containing the same subtle shift

04:05.840 --> 04:06.840
in position.

04:06.840 --> 04:10.600
Natural selection will never change an animal to a new kind of animal, it will only keep

04:10.600 --> 04:12.760
the species strong.

04:12.760 --> 04:15.520
And it might allow the species to adapt to a new environment.

04:15.520 --> 04:20.060
We now have Alaska rabbits that are able to survive in 20 below zero.

04:20.060 --> 04:23.940
And we have Florida rabbits that are able to survive in 100 degrees.

04:23.940 --> 04:27.660
And they are not inter-fertile, they're considered a different subspecies, maybe even a different

04:27.660 --> 04:29.380
species, I don't know.

04:29.380 --> 04:35.660
Now both of those Alaska rabbits and Florida rabbits can breed with Minnesota rabbits.

04:35.660 --> 04:37.660
They're kind of in the middle.

04:37.660 --> 04:40.380
Ok, and they're going to say, see this is evolution.

04:40.380 --> 04:45.020
No, it's a variation and it's still a rabbit.

04:45.020 --> 04:49.020
That doesn't prove it came from a rock folks, that's just a variety, that's all it is.

04:49.020 --> 04:52.340
And that's all that can ever be offered is examples of variation.

04:52.340 --> 04:56.520
Far from being a clip of Hovind I won't show you, I'm delighted to show you this because

04:56.520 --> 05:00.660
once again Hovind amends his definition of a kind.

05:00.660 --> 05:05.040
It's possible Hovind had to make this change when someone pointed out that Florida and

05:05.040 --> 05:09.560
Alaska rabbits can mate with Minnesota rabbits but not with each other.

05:09.560 --> 05:12.620
It's a kind of ring species with open ends.

05:12.620 --> 05:17.140
But in making the change Hovind has opened up a whole new can of worms.

05:17.140 --> 05:21.620
You see if Hovind accepts that a population of rabbits can split into two groups that

05:21.620 --> 05:27.540
evolve, sorry, change over time to the point where they can no longer interbreed, then

05:27.540 --> 05:32.980
he also has to accept that each of these populations can then split into two groups that change

05:32.980 --> 05:39.200
over time to the point where they can no longer interbreed and so on and so on.

05:39.200 --> 05:45.460
So what we end up with is this, a lot of groups each looking very different from the others,

05:45.460 --> 05:50.440
some bigger, some with longer tails, longer snouts, different diets, that can no longer

05:50.440 --> 05:52.260
interbreed.

05:52.260 --> 05:55.020
Now what does this chart remind you of?

05:55.020 --> 05:57.780
If this is not evolution then what is it?

05:57.780 --> 06:00.380
It's a variation and it's still a rabbit.

06:00.380 --> 06:03.460
But evolution is variation.

06:03.460 --> 06:08.060
So let's do a quick checklist of what the theory of evolution actually proposes and

06:08.060 --> 06:09.060
compare.

06:09.060 --> 06:14.360
Hovind thinks a species will change over time as it adapts to new environments and that's

06:14.360 --> 06:17.000
what the theory of evolution says.

06:17.000 --> 06:19.880
Hovind thinks this is because of natural selection.

06:19.880 --> 06:23.200
Well that's what the theory of evolution says.

06:23.200 --> 06:27.400
Hovind thinks this will produce a variety of new populations of animals that can no

06:27.400 --> 06:28.400
longer interbreed.

06:28.400 --> 06:32.400
Yes, that's what the theory of evolution says.

06:32.400 --> 06:34.480
Hovind calls this variation.

06:34.480 --> 06:38.120
The theory of evolution calls it evolution.

06:38.120 --> 06:43.280
And finally Hovind says organisms change but always stay within their own kind.

06:43.280 --> 06:48.840
And the theory of evolution can at last agree since a kind is now defined as an organism

06:48.840 --> 06:52.080
that shares a common ancestry.

06:52.080 --> 06:56.080
So the only thing we're left arguing about is what to call this process.

06:56.080 --> 07:01.000
And since Hovind has come so far in accepting every single facet of the theory of evolution

07:01.000 --> 07:05.420
as described by Charles Darwin, I think I can accommodate him a little by accepting

07:05.420 --> 07:08.040
whatever name he wants to call it.

07:08.040 --> 07:13.920
Because quite frankly, what to call a discovery is far less important than the discovery itself.

07:13.920 --> 07:18.200
And I'm happy to call animals that share a common ancestor a kind if Hovind wants to

07:18.200 --> 07:24.280
call them that, rather than genus, family, order and class as preferred by biologists.

07:24.280 --> 07:30.320
So is there any last loophole that prevents variation from being exactly the same as evolution?

07:30.320 --> 07:34.120
Yes, Hovind has another way to define a kind.

07:34.120 --> 07:36.560
And that is, it's obvious.

07:36.560 --> 07:41.940
So obvious that the acid test for a kind is to get a five year old child to tell you.

07:41.940 --> 07:47.920
Now this seems like such an absurd and unscientific definition, even for Hovind, that you probably

07:47.920 --> 07:49.720
think I'm making it up.

07:49.720 --> 07:50.720
So roll tape.

07:50.720 --> 07:57.720
I think in 99.9% of the cases it would be obvious to a five year old which animals are

07:57.720 --> 07:58.720
the same kind.

07:58.720 --> 08:03.240
And just to show he's right, in another lecture Hovind finds a five year old, well, a six

08:03.240 --> 08:05.600
year old who can do just that.

08:05.600 --> 08:07.320
Is anybody in here five or six years old?

08:07.320 --> 08:08.320
Who's five or six?

08:08.320 --> 08:10.320
How old are you?

08:10.320 --> 08:11.320
Six.

08:11.320 --> 08:12.320
What's your name?

08:12.320 --> 08:13.320
Rachel?

08:13.320 --> 08:14.320
Rachel?

08:14.320 --> 08:16.800
Why don't you take a test here, Rachel?

08:16.800 --> 08:20.800
Here we have a dog, a wolf, a coyote and a banana.

08:20.800 --> 08:26.040
Which one is not like the others?

08:26.040 --> 08:27.040
The banana!

08:27.040 --> 08:28.040
Very good, let's give her a hand.

08:28.040 --> 08:32.320
Now this isn't my test for what defines a kind, it's Hovind's.

08:32.320 --> 08:34.880
So let's apply it.

08:34.880 --> 08:36.840
Which one is not like the others?

08:36.840 --> 08:40.640
Clearly the banana, which makes all the others the same kind, right?

08:40.640 --> 08:41.640
They're all rabbits.

08:41.640 --> 08:44.000
Sorry, no they're not.

08:44.000 --> 08:46.140
This one is a hare.

08:46.140 --> 08:51.160
But that's okay, hares and rabbits share a common ancestor, and they're all laparids.

08:51.160 --> 08:55.600
And since Hovind defines a kind as a population that shares a common ancestor, even though

08:55.600 --> 09:01.120
they can't interbreed, and a five year old thinks a banana is the odd one out, then laparids

09:01.120 --> 09:03.480
are obviously the same kind.

09:03.480 --> 09:07.760
And while we're at it, varieties of pika also share a common ancestor with rabbits

09:07.760 --> 09:11.000
and hares, so they must be the same kind.

09:11.000 --> 09:16.300
Now pika aren't laparids, but pika, rabbits and hares are all lagomorphs.

09:16.300 --> 09:19.060
So they're all the same kind.

09:19.060 --> 09:22.920
Now pika don't exactly look like rabbits, but that doesn't matter.

09:22.920 --> 09:25.880
That's not a criterion for being the same kind.

09:25.880 --> 09:32.120
Hovind shows that himself in this illustration of what variation can do to an animal kind.

09:32.120 --> 09:33.680
And biologists agree.

09:33.680 --> 09:38.280
What an animal looks like is no guide to its genetic heritage.

09:38.280 --> 09:39.860
I'll show you what I mean.

09:39.860 --> 09:44.040
Here we have an echidna, a hedgehog, a porcupine and a banana.

09:44.040 --> 09:48.900
Once again, the banana is not like the others, which a five year old can tell you must mean

09:48.900 --> 09:51.200
that the others are the same kind.

09:51.200 --> 09:56.000
But one's a rodent, one's an insectivore, and the other's a monotreme, which means it

09:56.000 --> 09:57.760
lays eggs.

09:57.760 --> 10:01.720
Even so, they all fulfil Hovind's criteria for being the same kind.

10:01.720 --> 10:04.160
They're all mammals.

10:04.160 --> 10:08.540
Remember I'm going by Hovind's definition of a kind, not mine.

10:08.540 --> 10:12.320
They share a common ancestry, even though they can't interbreed, and they're obviously

10:12.320 --> 10:16.960
the same kind when put up against a banana for the judgement of a five year old.

10:16.960 --> 10:18.160
What about the name?

10:18.160 --> 10:21.600
Maybe if they all have the same name, they're the same kind.

10:21.600 --> 10:26.100
Well Hovind doesn't define a kind that way, and for good reason, because animals don't

10:26.100 --> 10:29.060
come with names, we give them names.

10:29.060 --> 10:33.260
If you want to argue that bears are the same kind because they're all called bears, what

10:33.260 --> 10:35.000
about koala bears?

10:35.000 --> 10:40.180
If they're really bears, then how come they have pouches and other bears don't?

10:40.180 --> 10:43.140
And there's another danger with grouping animals by their names.

10:43.140 --> 10:47.740
If you stick a five year old creationist kid in front of this puzzle, it's likely to cause

10:47.740 --> 10:53.360
some confusion, because obviously the banana is again not like the others, so they must

10:53.360 --> 10:55.300
all be the same kind.

10:55.300 --> 10:57.420
Yes, they're all apes.

10:57.420 --> 11:00.900
Oh dear, you may not like where this is heading.

11:00.900 --> 11:05.420
And if they're all the same kind, they must have a common ancestor.

11:05.420 --> 11:08.260
Quick, get that kid away and send him off to Christian camp.

11:08.260 --> 11:12.140
Oh gosh, creationists are running out of get-out clauses here.

11:12.140 --> 11:13.580
Okay, here's one.

11:13.580 --> 11:17.780
Animals can evolve, sorry, change over time into new varieties, but there's a limit on

11:17.780 --> 11:21.860
how far that evolu- sorry, that variation can go.

11:21.860 --> 11:24.220
Okay, what's the limit?

11:24.220 --> 11:29.400
If one population of animals can divide into two, and each of those can divide into two,

11:29.400 --> 11:33.260
and each of those can divide into two, what's the limiting factor?

11:33.260 --> 11:37.260
Does natural selection suddenly stop working after a certain number of species have been

11:37.260 --> 11:38.260
produced?

11:38.260 --> 11:42.420
As long as they're all defined as the same kind, no creationist seems to have imposed

11:42.420 --> 11:44.520
any limit.

11:44.520 --> 11:48.740
After discovering Hovind's change of definition, I soon began to find other creationists accepting

11:48.740 --> 11:53.420
speciation even in websites like Answers in Genesis.

11:53.660 --> 11:58.740
Areas to reproduction do seem to arise among varieties that once interbred.

11:58.740 --> 12:02.860
But again, Gary Parker doesn't like to call this evolution.

12:02.860 --> 12:04.100
How does he get out of it?

12:04.100 --> 12:10.300
Well, he explains, any real evolution, macroevolution, requires an expansion of the gene pool, the

12:10.300 --> 12:12.740
addition of new genes and new traits.

12:12.740 --> 12:16.500
Well, that's not any definition of evolution I've ever heard of.

12:16.500 --> 12:20.820
And in fact, biology textbooks are full of examples of organisms that lose traits as

12:20.820 --> 12:21.940
they evolve.

12:21.940 --> 12:27.260
The ancestors of whales once had feet, the ancestors of penguins could fly, the ancestors

12:27.260 --> 12:31.240
of moles could see, and the ancestors of chickens had teeth.

12:31.240 --> 12:33.940
And at the same time, they gain new traits.

12:33.940 --> 12:38.040
Whales can hold their breath underwater, penguins are protected against the cold, moles have

12:38.040 --> 12:40.020
powerful claws for digging.

12:40.020 --> 12:42.300
All of this is evolution.

12:42.300 --> 12:47.000
Evolution is defined in most biology textbooks as a change in the gene pool, a change in

12:47.000 --> 12:52.560
features and traits, and a change or a modification of an organism's characteristics.

12:52.560 --> 12:56.760
Parker is trying to make up his own definition of evolution, simply because the accepted

12:56.760 --> 13:02.960
definition is uncomfortably close to his view of how animals change over time.

13:02.960 --> 13:07.640
But the problem with trying to shift the goalposts like this is that his own new theory of speciation

13:07.640 --> 13:10.080
automatically moves with them.

13:10.080 --> 13:14.600
Because whatever arguments he uses to show that animals can't change into new species

13:14.600 --> 13:21.240
automatically negates his own theory that animals can change into new species.

13:21.240 --> 13:25.240
Let's take Parker's main argument against evolution as an example.

13:25.240 --> 13:31.260
Each variety resulting from reproductive isolation has a smaller gene pool than the original.

13:31.260 --> 13:35.060
What he's saying quite correctly is that evolution works like this.

13:35.060 --> 13:39.440
A population of animals separates geographically into two groups.

13:39.440 --> 13:43.500
According to the theory of evolution, each will change over time.

13:43.500 --> 13:48.300
One group might move into a cold environment and grow thick fur and a mechanism for preventing

13:48.300 --> 13:49.660
frostbite.

13:49.660 --> 13:53.700
Another group might live in a wooded environment and adapt to climbing trees.

13:53.700 --> 13:59.780
A third group might adapt to tropical wetlands and change its diet to crabs and insects.

13:59.780 --> 14:05.260
Now Parker argues that evolution isn't possible because as each population splits, each new

14:05.260 --> 14:10.060
subgroup will have a smaller gene pool than the original large group.

14:10.060 --> 14:14.380
Instead, he proposes a different model of speciation.

14:14.380 --> 14:18.460
A population of animals separates geographically into two groups.

14:18.460 --> 14:22.320
According to Parker's idea, each will change over time.

14:22.320 --> 14:26.820
One group might move into a cold environment and grow thick fur and a mechanism for preventing

14:26.820 --> 14:27.980
frostbite.

14:27.980 --> 14:32.060
Another group might live in a wooded environment and adapt to climbing trees.

14:32.060 --> 14:37.340
A third group might adapt to tropical wetlands and change its diet to crabs and insects.

14:37.340 --> 14:40.620
This is exactly the same as the theory of evolution.

14:40.620 --> 14:45.420
But according to Parker, evolution can't happen because each separated population has a smaller

14:45.420 --> 14:46.940
gene pool.

14:46.940 --> 14:52.420
And yet, according to Parker, speciation can happen under exactly the same circumstances

14:52.420 --> 14:56.420
using exactly the same mechanism of natural selection.

14:56.420 --> 15:01.660
So as long as we don't call it evolution, creationists accept that animals can evolve.

15:01.660 --> 15:04.620
Oh damn, I mean change.

15:04.620 --> 15:08.640
And Hovind agrees, as long as we call it variation.

15:08.640 --> 15:13.500
Because if we switch from a hypothetical to a real example, Hovind says that canids, or

15:13.500 --> 15:18.380
dogs as he calls them, all came from a common ancestor, producing wolves that can survive

15:18.380 --> 15:23.400
in arctic conditions, foxes that can climb trees in North American forests, and foxes

15:23.400 --> 15:27.780
that live in South American swamplands eating crabs and insects.

15:27.780 --> 15:32.780
Since Parker argues that this kind of change or variation happens, we can't really take

15:32.780 --> 15:37.120
him seriously when he gives reasons as to why it can't happen.

15:37.120 --> 15:39.740
And here's someone else who accepts that it happens.

15:39.740 --> 15:43.620
Since two dogs walked off the ark, then as the population of dogs increased, eventually

15:43.620 --> 15:46.860
the population would split up and different groups would form.

15:46.860 --> 15:51.580
As the gene pool was split up, different combinations of genes, inherited from the original dogs,

15:51.580 --> 15:52.900
would end up in different groups.

15:52.900 --> 15:57.380
Thus different species would form, such as dingoes, wolves, and so on.

15:57.380 --> 16:01.660
Now evolutionists have always insisted that such a process happens slowly, and therefore

16:01.660 --> 16:05.060
the Bible can't be right when it says the land animals came off the ark only four and

16:05.060 --> 16:06.860
a half thousand years ago.

16:06.860 --> 16:12.960
It's interesting that the only difference Ken Ham can find with evolution is the timescale.

16:12.960 --> 16:17.820
Now I've always known that Ken Ham, like other creationists, accepted natural selection.

16:17.820 --> 16:22.160
The evolution of the horse is explained right there in his creation museum.

16:22.160 --> 16:25.860
Of course it's not called evolution, it's called development.

16:25.860 --> 16:29.400
Boy they really think it's all about what you call something, don't they?

16:29.400 --> 16:34.180
But the diagram doesn't show the horse evolving or developing into different species that

16:34.180 --> 16:35.760
can't interbreed.

16:35.760 --> 16:40.160
And for the most part, creationist preachers won't tell you this unless someone specifically

16:40.160 --> 16:43.680
brings up the issue of ring species or rabbits.

16:43.680 --> 16:47.320
So now you have two different ways to confuse a creationist.

16:47.320 --> 16:51.560
If they don't accept that animals change into new species that can't interbreed, show them

16:51.560 --> 16:53.840
the example of ring species.

16:53.840 --> 16:58.720
And if they do accept it, then ask them how this is different to evolution.

16:58.720 --> 17:02.720
But isn't it nice after all these years to know that creationists are finally accepting

17:02.720 --> 17:07.200
evolution or change or variety or whatever they want to call it, and it's so nice to

17:07.200 --> 17:10.200
come together.

17:10.200 --> 17:11.000
Not like that!
