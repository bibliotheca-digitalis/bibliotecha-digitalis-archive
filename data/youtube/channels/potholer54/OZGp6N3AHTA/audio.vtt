00:00.000 --> 00:05.280
This is just a follow-up to my video on the first episode of Graham Hancock's Netflix series.

00:05.840 --> 00:11.280
I'm going to look at some of the responses I received, and in answer to some of those posts,

00:11.280 --> 00:16.160
I'll take a look in this video at Hancock's claims about Gobekli Tepe,

00:16.160 --> 00:20.240
which is one of the world's oldest construction sites now in Turkey.

00:21.280 --> 00:27.760
We'll see how this guy can move huge 20-tonne stone blocks all on his own, and we'll see why

00:27.760 --> 00:32.720
an innocent belief in lost civilisations can have real-world consequences.

00:33.600 --> 00:39.760
In my last video, I found lots of fabrications just in that first episode. Unfortunately,

00:39.760 --> 00:43.280
fans of Graham Hancock didn't want to talk about episode one.

00:43.840 --> 00:50.800
Quite understandably, they asked what about episode seven, or episode three, or five?

00:50.800 --> 00:56.400
What about all the things he didn't cover like Gobekli Tepe, or Bimini Road, or water erosion

00:56.400 --> 01:02.240
around the Sphinx, or Lidar findings in the Amazon, or Gobekli Tepe, or the Sphinx, or Clovis

01:02.240 --> 01:09.360
First, or Gobekli Tepe, or Lidar and Stuff, or the Sphinx, or Gobekli Tepe, or Nothing Before Clovis,

01:09.360 --> 01:15.040
or 10-tonne blocks, or the Malta episode, or Bimini Road, or Gobekli Tepe?

01:15.600 --> 01:20.960
Why didn't I start with episode five? Because when faced with a Netflix series,

01:20.960 --> 01:26.960
I usually tend to start at episode one. But hey, that's just me. I don't live by the

01:26.960 --> 01:34.160
conventional rules of society. I'm a rebel. The way I deal with predictable what about responses

01:34.160 --> 01:41.360
is to say I'll deal with just one what about, so give it your best shot. In this case, there were

01:41.360 --> 01:47.120
so many what abouts that the fairest thing to do was address the most popular of them, which is

01:47.120 --> 01:53.680
what about Gobekli Tepe in episode five? For time and copyright reasons, I'm not going to

01:53.680 --> 02:00.080
show the clips. I'll use the transcript instead. It's interesting that without the dramatic music

02:00.080 --> 02:06.720
and the triggering images, the lost civilisation narrative looks even less convincing. And please

02:06.720 --> 02:12.800
note that just like last time, I have zero interest in Hancock's personality, because

02:12.800 --> 02:18.560
this is not about his personality or my personality. Thanks for your interest. It's

02:18.560 --> 02:24.960
about the facts. We'll start with a claim I've already debunked. Referring to the Younger Dryas

02:24.960 --> 02:31.040
period around 12,000 years ago, Graham says, the world suffered through some kind of tremendous

02:31.040 --> 02:38.080
geological upheaval, including immense floods. But Hancock fans who watched my previous video

02:38.080 --> 02:43.520
already know that those immense floods never happened. The Younger Dryas sea level rise that

02:43.520 --> 02:49.120
Graham referred to was only around half an inch a year, and not very different to the rise in

02:49.120 --> 02:54.640
sea levels that had been going on for thousands of years before, and continued for thousands of

02:54.640 --> 03:01.680
years after the Younger Dryas. And none of his fans disagreed. In episode five, the one on Gobekli

03:01.680 --> 03:09.360
Tepe, Hancock continues, and around 11,600 years ago the freeze ended with another final immense

03:09.360 --> 03:17.200
flood that raised sea levels around the world. No, there was no immense flood 11,600 years ago

03:17.200 --> 03:23.680
either. If there had been, and Hancock's talking about a global flood, it would show up in the

03:23.680 --> 03:30.240
stratigraphy. All floods leave a record. Every large tsunami leaves a record. If you've ever

03:30.240 --> 03:35.840
had a house flooded you'll be familiar with the film of scum and mud and general debris

03:35.840 --> 03:41.920
it leaves behind. Flood deposits are easily recognisable in core samples taken from lakes

03:41.920 --> 03:49.040
and swamps. So episode five is no different to episode one in fabricating, that means making up,

03:49.040 --> 03:54.960
a series of immense and imaginary deluges, and even adding another one with a specific date.

03:55.840 --> 04:01.120
The other thing I quickly discovered is that episode five is no different to episode one

04:01.120 --> 04:06.800
in its derogatory depiction of archaeologists and the misrepresentation of their conclusions.

04:07.760 --> 04:13.360
In southeastern Turkey, near modern-day Sanliurfa, something remarkable happened around the end of

04:13.360 --> 04:19.120
the last ice age, Hancock says. Our Stone Age hunter-gatherer ancestors suddenly discovered

04:19.120 --> 04:25.920
farming and began creating settlements. This of course is nonsense according to archaeological

04:25.920 --> 04:33.120
evidence gathered over the last 30 years, as we'll see. But if you look down it seems clear

04:33.120 --> 04:39.200
Hancock isn't trying to give us his belief, he thinks he's giving us the view of archaeologists.

04:40.240 --> 04:45.440
Now I'm sure this is what Graham Hancock learned in elementary school back in the 60s,

04:45.440 --> 04:52.240
because I learned the same thing. That's why it's about 60 years out of date. No serious

04:52.240 --> 04:58.240
archaeologist these days thinks hunter-gatherers suddenly discovered farming and began creating

04:58.240 --> 05:03.920
settlements. But that view of history now cries out to be rewritten, Hancock says.

05:05.040 --> 05:11.440
Actually it was rewritten over three decades ago. There have been hundreds of discoveries since the

05:11.440 --> 05:18.320
1960s showing that hunter-gatherer societies were not what Graham calls simple and unsophisticated

05:18.320 --> 05:24.640
people. As I said in my last video they had societies, culture, trade, language, art,

05:24.640 --> 05:31.280
and yes even construction. They didn't suddenly discover farming, it was a transition that took

05:31.280 --> 05:37.600
thousands of years. As for Gobekli Tepe itself, based on everything we've been taught about

05:37.600 --> 05:44.080
prehistory, Graham says it shouldn't exist. That would only be true if science was the

05:44.080 --> 05:49.360
same as religion, where the conclusion is an immutable belief that can't be overturned.

05:50.080 --> 05:56.720
In religion, or any kind of dogma, evidence is changed to be consistent with the dogmatic

05:56.720 --> 06:02.720
conclusion. We saw that in episode one. According to the lost civilisation belief,

06:02.720 --> 06:08.560
coral pillars at Nan Madol shouldn't exist, so they were changed to man-made pillars.

06:09.760 --> 06:15.040
In science, it's the other way round. The conclusion has to be changed to be consistent

06:15.040 --> 06:20.560
with the evidence. There's a wonderful clip of creationist Ian Juby getting frustrated

06:20.560 --> 06:26.160
at how scientists change their conclusions about evolution every time they find new evidence.

06:27.120 --> 06:43.600
But that's precisely science. That's why archaeologists never deal with new evidence

06:43.600 --> 06:50.080
by saying it shouldn't exist, they simply change their understanding of the past, their conclusions

06:50.080 --> 06:54.640
in light of it. That's why the conclusion that there was nothing older than Clovis in

06:54.640 --> 07:00.960
North America was changed when archaeologists discovered pre-Clovis artefacts, the understanding

07:00.960 --> 07:06.160
that there were no settlements in the Amazon was overturned when Lidar discovered settlements in

07:06.160 --> 07:11.920
the Amazon, and the understanding that Mesolithic hunter-gatherers didn't build large structures

07:11.920 --> 07:17.680
was overturned when archaeologists discovered Gobekli Tepe. None of these discoveries

07:17.680 --> 07:23.440
contradict our understanding of history, they only contradict our previous understanding of history.

07:24.000 --> 07:30.000
As Ian Juby noted, conclusions in archaeology, like all sciences, change to be consistent with

07:30.000 --> 07:36.560
the latest evidence. If archaeologists were stuck in dogma and never changed, as Hancock claims,

07:36.560 --> 07:40.720
we'd still be stuck with the archaeology that he and I learned in the 1960s.

07:41.680 --> 07:48.000
Now, in anticipation of the post that some of you are already writing, of course there are a lot of

07:48.000 --> 07:54.240
fusty old archaeology professors with fixed ideas, just like in all sciences. Anyone who thinks

07:54.240 --> 08:00.000
otherwise hasn't watched my channel, where I'm constantly correcting old professors and PhDs

08:00.000 --> 08:05.440
who cling to dogmatic beliefs. But even the most dogmatic and determined professor,

08:05.440 --> 08:09.920
who told his students that nothing would be found below the Clovis layer in North America,

08:09.920 --> 08:14.800
had to eat his words when archaeologists did find artefacts below the Clovis layer.

08:15.440 --> 08:20.720
And please note, before you rewrite that furious post, this doesn't mean that the lost

08:20.720 --> 08:26.320
civilisation belief must be true on the basis that our understanding of history always changes.

08:27.040 --> 08:32.800
Because our understanding changes based on evidence, not a belief dreamed up in an armchair

08:32.800 --> 08:39.200
and then made into a popular TV programme. Sorry, but fake and fabricated evidence doesn't count.

08:39.760 --> 08:44.000
It may convince a Netflix audience, but it doesn't impress scientific journals.

08:45.120 --> 08:51.280
The next attempt to undermine archaeology is this. Archaeologists accept that it dates back

08:51.280 --> 08:58.560
to around 11,600 years ago. No, archaeologists don't accept the fact that it dates back to

08:58.560 --> 09:05.520
around 11,600 years ago. Archaeologists are telling us that it dates back to around that time.

09:06.400 --> 09:11.760
They were the ones who did the painstaking study dating it all. It's their conclusion.

09:12.720 --> 09:18.560
So why the rather odd wording? As I said in my last video, it's all about

09:18.560 --> 09:22.480
impressions and images. Graham could have simply said,

09:22.480 --> 09:29.520
archaeologists dated the site to around 11,600 years ago. Perfectly true. But that makes it

09:29.520 --> 09:36.160
look like archaeologists are making discoveries and not sticking rigidly to orthodoxy. So it

09:36.160 --> 09:41.600
doesn't fit the narrative of dogmatic, dumb archaeologists who have to be reluctantly

09:41.600 --> 09:47.440
dragged into accepting something that lost civilisation believers readily understand.

09:48.800 --> 09:52.800
Slipping the word accept makes it sound as though someone else did the dating

09:52.800 --> 09:59.600
and archaeologists grudgingly went along with it. The wording is no accident. In the media,

09:59.600 --> 10:03.200
words are carefully thought out to convey a particular standpoint.

10:03.840 --> 10:08.640
For example, look at the difference here, imagining a 17th century report about

10:08.640 --> 10:13.920
Galileo's discovery of the moons of Jupiter. The straightforward version would be,

10:13.920 --> 10:20.800
Galileo discovers that Jupiter has moons. Now contrast that with Galileo accepts

10:20.800 --> 10:26.880
that Jupiter has moons. See the difference? Journalists can make the insinuation even

10:26.880 --> 10:31.920
more damning by saying Galileo admits that Jupiter has moons.

10:33.040 --> 10:39.600
It's just one manipulation of the audience, but little by little each line builds up this picture

10:39.600 --> 10:44.080
of Graham being out in front and archaeologists sticking to old ideas.

10:45.360 --> 10:51.600
The reality is that archaeologists not only dated this site, they hailed it as a breakthrough in our

10:51.600 --> 10:57.600
understanding of hunter-gatherer societies. Archaeology was rewritten. If they weren't

10:57.600 --> 11:02.800
advanced enough to design and build this megalithic wonder, he says, who did and why?

11:03.520 --> 11:08.960
But who says they weren't advanced enough? Certainly no one who has researched the site.

11:08.960 --> 11:14.640
This assumption that they weren't advanced enough is so dogmatic that it doesn't even look at the

11:14.640 --> 11:20.000
clear evidence against this. The programme goes straight to the assumption that this must be the

11:20.000 --> 11:27.360
work of someone else. In the form of a question, of course, because hey, just asking. I showed

11:27.360 --> 11:32.400
this technique of slipping an unsupported assumption into a question in my last video.

11:33.120 --> 11:38.080
Take a look if you haven't seen it, because it's a very popular advertising formula

11:38.080 --> 11:44.400
and we need to be on our guard against it. Notice also how Graham again uses trigger words,

11:44.400 --> 11:48.880
just as we saw in the last video, to build an image in his audience's heads.

11:50.000 --> 11:55.200
Built at a time when the earth was just emerging from the last ice age, when locals were still

11:55.200 --> 12:02.160
supposedly unsophisticated hunter-gatherers living in mud huts. But if they weren't advanced enough

12:02.160 --> 12:09.200
to design and build this megalithic wonder, who did and why? Since his aim is to downgrade

12:09.200 --> 12:16.320
Mesolithic hunter-gatherers and upgrade Gobekli Tepe, he uses words like simple, unsophisticated

12:16.320 --> 12:22.880
and mud huts to describe the former and words like wonder and highly sophisticated and highly

12:22.880 --> 12:30.400
advanced to describe the latter. So let's lose all the trigger words and the emotional baggage

12:30.400 --> 12:34.720
and look at how difficult it might have been to build Gobekli Tepe.

12:36.240 --> 12:42.000
First, why would they build the site in the first place? Archaeologists say the most likely answer

12:42.000 --> 12:48.640
is a spiritual or ceremonial meeting place and this isn't unusual. Hunter-gatherer societies

12:48.640 --> 12:53.920
had widespread connections during the Mesolithic and there's evidence they often came together in

12:53.920 --> 12:59.920
sacred places for feasting and trading and no doubt for matchmaking and ceremonial worship.

13:00.640 --> 13:05.840
Australian aborigines used to do it, Plains Indians used to do it and clearly the people

13:05.840 --> 13:10.960
of Anatolia used to do it. And if you think it's far-fetched to suppose that people would

13:10.960 --> 13:16.880
put so much time and effort into a structure that was purely ceremonial and spiritual,

13:16.880 --> 13:21.280
just look at how much time and effort was put into building the beautiful,

13:21.280 --> 13:28.880
yet arguably pointless cathedrals of Europe. The exact nature of their religion is hard to fathom

13:28.880 --> 13:34.400
but evidence suggests that it may have started as a cemetery, a place on top of a hill where

13:34.400 --> 13:40.400
the dead were brought and their skulls defleshed and hung up. And the evidence shows that each

13:40.400 --> 13:46.640
stage of the building was deliberately buried and then restarted but again we don't know why.

13:48.000 --> 13:53.520
Next comes the planning. The first three enclosures of Göbekli Tepe are laid out on an

13:53.520 --> 13:59.040
equilateral triangle, which is fascinating from an archaeological point of view because prior to

13:59.040 --> 14:04.800
this discovery the earliest dates when geometry was known to be part of the human thought process

14:04.800 --> 14:11.280
was 10,000 years ago. So now we know the earliest date is 11,500 years ago.

14:12.240 --> 14:14.800
But from the point of view of an ancient civilisation,

14:21.920 --> 14:26.400
there's no reason why hunter-gatherers couldn't have made an equilateral triangle.

14:26.400 --> 14:32.000
All it takes is a long rope, which they had, divided into three parts and pegged out.

14:32.000 --> 14:33.760
But it's a nice triangle.

14:33.760 --> 14:40.640
Third, cutting the stones. What they made around 11,500 years ago was several enclosures

14:40.640 --> 14:46.400
ringed by pillars brought in from a nearby limestone quarry. This is one of the T-shaped

14:46.400 --> 14:51.680
pillars they were cutting out, around seven metres long, which for some reason they left in the

14:51.680 --> 14:59.520
ground. So we can see the quarrying process itself. How did they cut the stones? Surprisingly,

14:59.600 --> 15:05.360
he is in tools made of flint, which have been found all over the site. This kind of limestone

15:05.360 --> 15:12.240
is relatively soft, and flint is hard. So cutting it isn't a problem, and the limestone slabs are

15:12.240 --> 15:18.400
naturally faltered along vertical and horizontal lines, so as long as each side was cut away,

15:18.400 --> 15:24.320
the stone was free to move. I was curious to see how Graham explained these rather

15:24.320 --> 15:31.680
less than advanced flint tools, and the answer is, of course, he doesn't. As we saw in episode 1,

15:31.680 --> 15:37.440
any evidence that doesn't fit the story of an advanced civilisation is simply not mentioned.

15:38.480 --> 15:43.760
As for transporting the stones, that's not difficult either. There are many ways of

15:43.760 --> 15:53.280
moving large stones. A sled, wrapped in a roller, walked along, pulled on a rail.

15:53.840 --> 15:59.760
As I said in my last video, all it takes is rope, a few simple tools, lots of people,

15:59.760 --> 16:06.880
and organisation. By the way, there's a great video showing how just one guy can move huge,

16:06.880 --> 16:14.080
twenty tonne stone blocks all on his own, using simple cradles and pivot points. One small stone

16:14.080 --> 16:20.560
underneath a large block, and he can turn it single handed. Two stones, and he can make it move.

16:21.440 --> 16:28.160
Wally Wallington here also shows how just one man can raise a huge block by rocking it back and

16:28.160 --> 16:34.080
forwards, like a teeter totter, and putting wooden blocks under the middle each time one side lifts

16:34.080 --> 16:40.880
up. And once it's raised up, it's a simple matter of leaning and pulling to slip it into a pit,

16:40.880 --> 16:48.240
and then to the vertical. So far, nothing suggests that these supposedly unsophisticated hunter

16:48.240 --> 16:53.600
gatherers, living in mud huts as Graham calls them, weren't advanced enough to cut stones

16:53.600 --> 16:59.920
with flint tools and move them. The only question is how these people sustained themselves.

17:00.800 --> 17:06.240
After all, farming societies can store grain and livestock and sustain a workforce on large

17:06.240 --> 17:11.840
projects. So if large numbers of hunter gatherers stayed in one place during the construction of

17:11.840 --> 17:17.200
Gobekli Tepe, wouldn't they very quickly have exhausted everything they could hunt and gather

17:17.200 --> 17:23.840
in the area? Here again, the evidence is changing our understanding of how hunter gatherer societies

17:23.840 --> 17:31.520
lived, at least in that region at that time. According to a study by Dietrich et al. in 2019,

17:32.160 --> 17:38.400
handstones, pestles and mortars, grinding slabs and bowls were found at the site, all related

17:38.400 --> 17:45.920
to processing wild cereals that had been gathered. As for the hunting part, 60% of the butchered

17:45.920 --> 17:51.920
bones found at the site were gazelle. The other bones came from wild asses, no jokes please,

17:52.560 --> 18:00.560
vultures, cranes, ducks and geese. And everything suggests that the building was seasonal and the

18:00.560 --> 18:06.240
hunter gatherers collected in that place at a time when gazelle were passing through in migratory

18:06.240 --> 18:13.360
herds and food was plentiful. The evidence clearly shows that Gobekli Tepe was built long before

18:13.360 --> 18:19.920
agriculture and animal domestication. The Netflix programme doesn't even look at this evidence.

18:19.920 --> 18:26.320
It ignored it in favour of a familiar rhetorical technique. Give two people two choices, one of

18:26.320 --> 18:32.080
them your own belief and the other a far more absurd option, and ask them to choose which one

18:32.080 --> 18:38.880
makes more sense. Isn't it time to consider the possibility that the great megalithic enclosures

18:38.880 --> 18:45.600
weren't some miraculous overnight invention of hunter gatherers, Graham asks, but were a legacy

18:45.600 --> 18:52.000
from a precociously advanced lost civilisation of prehistory? This is an ocean which mainstream

18:52.000 --> 18:59.120
archaeologists find almost offensive. They don't find the idea offensive as far as I know,

18:59.120 --> 19:04.400
it's just that Hancock's ideas have been considered. There are numerous archaeologists

19:04.400 --> 19:09.200
who have looked at them, and they have been rejected for reasons I showed in the previous

19:09.200 --> 19:15.680
video, namely that a lot of the evidence for them has been fabricated, and there's no evidence that

19:15.680 --> 19:22.160
supports them, and a mountain of evidence that directly contradicts them. The idea that Gobekli

19:22.160 --> 19:28.880
Tepe suddenly miraculously sprung up overnight, to paraphrase Graham, has also been rejected,

19:28.880 --> 19:35.600
because again the evidence shows that it didn't. But these are the only two options we're given.

19:36.560 --> 19:42.080
It's a common technique called a false dichotomy. I've shown this before when a Golden Crocoduck

19:42.080 --> 19:48.080
nominee, Brock Lee, used the same technique to divert attention from the idea that a hammer

19:48.080 --> 19:54.640
encased in sediment was the result of a well-known process called accretion. Just don't give the

19:54.640 --> 19:59.680
audience that option. Hypothesis one, the creation one, maybe dinosaurs and man live together and

19:59.680 --> 20:06.320
these are just artifacts from before the flood. Possibility two, maybe aliens came here, dropped

20:06.320 --> 20:10.880
off these hammers, and then a Tyrannosaurus rex had to evolve human-like fingers to pick up all

20:10.880 --> 20:16.320
of these artifacts being left by the aliens. How many of you think the creation, the biblical view

20:16.320 --> 20:21.360
of humans and dinosaurs living together is more likely? And my kids used to do it when I refused

20:21.360 --> 20:25.840
to buy them candy in the supermarket. Do you want me to starve to death, they'd say?

20:26.640 --> 20:32.000
They assumed that when Dad was faced with the choice between candy and death, he'd very

20:32.000 --> 20:38.480
sensibly choose to buy the candy. What they didn't count on was Dad's cunning ability to spot a third

20:38.480 --> 20:46.080
option, wait for dinner. Archaeologists find this simplistic choice between two unsupported ideas

20:46.080 --> 20:52.080
not offensive, that's too strong a word, but laughable because it completely omits the third

20:52.080 --> 20:58.800
and most obvious option that Gobekli Tepe was part of a learning curve just like any other building.

21:00.240 --> 21:05.840
For example, if a future race of intelligent apes came across the remains of St Paul's Cathedral

21:05.840 --> 21:12.400
and little else, they might well conclude that it came out of nowhere overnight. They'd argue

21:12.400 --> 21:16.880
it's impossible for people at that time to suddenly acquire the skills and the knowledge

21:16.880 --> 21:22.880
to build something so incredible, so surely the only option is that wise men from a great

21:22.880 --> 21:28.080
civilisation must have descended on London, built the Cathedral and then gone home again.

21:29.600 --> 21:34.640
But if you look at the wider context, you can see that St Paul's didn't spring up out of nowhere.

21:35.440 --> 21:41.280
Excavations further afield would reveal how buildings got larger and more complex over

21:41.280 --> 21:47.760
hundreds of years. You can clearly see a learning curve as builders copied old techniques and

21:47.760 --> 21:53.920
discovered new ones, sometimes learning from failures as often as successes. For example,

21:53.920 --> 21:59.760
flying buttresses at St Paul's were an innovation that developed after the failure of unsupported

21:59.760 --> 22:07.120
walls at the Hagia Sophia in Istanbul hundreds of years earlier. Dig below St Paul's and you'll

22:07.120 --> 22:12.880
find the remains of an older Cathedral underneath, and further down still you'll see the remains of

22:12.880 --> 22:20.000
the old Roman settlement on Ludgate Hill. Future archaeologists can find the quarries and see how

22:20.000 --> 22:27.200
the stones were cut and transported. All of this context shows that St Paul's didn't just spring

22:27.200 --> 22:33.920
out of nowhere overnight, nor did it require an ancient civilisation sailing in from somewhere

22:33.920 --> 22:40.880
else. Having presented his two options, Hancock then dismisses one of them as completely absurd.

22:41.440 --> 22:46.640
You can't just wake up one morning with no prior skills, no prior knowledge, no background in

22:46.640 --> 22:53.440
working with stone and create something like Gobekli Tepe, he argues. And that only leaves us

22:53.440 --> 23:00.400
with, what luck, the option of his lost civilisation. But hang on a minute. For once

23:00.400 --> 23:07.840
archaeologists and Hancock are in agreement, this is a completely absurd option. So let's get rid of

23:07.840 --> 23:13.200
the false dichotomy and replace that nonsense option with the more realistic and sensible

23:13.200 --> 23:19.840
option proposed by archaeologists, that ancient Anatolians started on a smaller scale and worked

23:19.840 --> 23:25.840
their way up. And it took them around 1,500 years to build the entire site.

23:25.840 --> 23:30.720
There has to be a long history behind it, continues Hancock,

23:30.720 --> 23:37.280
and that history is completely missing. And to me it very strongly speaks of a lost civilisation.

23:38.240 --> 23:44.080
Or it speaks very strongly of the fact that the long history is missing from the Netflix programme.

23:45.040 --> 23:50.800
If you look at Gobekli Tepe in the wider context, as we did with St Paul's Cathedral, the evidence

23:50.800 --> 23:55.680
suggests that there was prior knowledge and there was a background of working with stone,

23:55.680 --> 24:01.760
going back at least 2,000 years before Gobekli Tepe. It just didn't fit the idea of a lost

24:01.760 --> 24:09.120
civilisation, so it wasn't mentioned. There are dozens of sites, either being excavated

24:09.120 --> 24:15.040
or waiting to be excavated in the region, and Gobekli Tepe didn't remain the oldest site for long.

24:16.000 --> 24:22.720
Bonjour Cloutala, about 200km to the east of Gobekli Tepe, is estimated to have been built

24:22.720 --> 24:28.160
up to 1,000 years earlier. Archaeologists have found that it was built in stages,

24:28.160 --> 24:33.360
starting with a small temple in the middle, in which four limestone blocks stand upright

24:33.360 --> 24:39.280
in the earth floor. And there are sites even older than that. Pinabasi Hooyuk dates back to

24:39.280 --> 24:46.320
around 16,000 years ago. It's a burial site and found so recently that I can't even find any

24:46.320 --> 24:50.960
scientific studies on it. But there was an announcement from the Turkish Ministry of

24:50.960 --> 24:58.320
Culture and Tourism last year, with photos that show small arrangements of stones 2,500 years

24:58.320 --> 25:05.280
older than Gobekli Tepe. The flint tools also have to be looked at in a wider context. There's

25:05.280 --> 25:11.040
no flint or obsidian in the Gobekli Tepe plateau, so it was brought in from further afield.

25:11.920 --> 25:16.640
Archaeologists have discovered a network of flint and obsidian trade from around that time,

25:17.280 --> 25:24.160
reaching as far away as Georgia in the Caucasus. The style of flint shaping, called napping,

25:24.160 --> 25:29.760
differs according to the different cultures from around the region who gathered at Gobekli Tepe.

25:31.120 --> 25:36.320
So by looking at Gobekli Tepe in context, there's more than enough evidence to support

25:36.320 --> 25:42.720
the conclusion that it was part of a learning curve, just like St Paul's Cathedral. Archaeologists

25:42.720 --> 25:49.440
are still literally just scratching the surface, but what little they've found so far is consistent

25:49.440 --> 25:56.160
with stone construction that began very crudely and simply and grew in size and complexity

25:56.160 --> 26:03.040
over thousands of years. So what evidence is there for what Hancock considers to be the only option?

26:03.840 --> 26:08.560
There's no evidence of any outside influence or advanced technology in the region at that time.

26:09.520 --> 26:13.120
Hancock says they transferred their technology and their skills.

26:14.000 --> 26:19.200
If so, what technology and which skills? Or to put it another way…

26:20.880 --> 26:27.360
That's a very good question. Did they teach them how to hunt gazelle? Or how to deflesh skulls?

26:27.360 --> 26:33.840
How to make flint axes? How to cut and move stones? Or how to pick wild grains and crush them?

26:34.720 --> 26:39.920
If so, it doesn't sound like these outsiders were any more advanced than the people they were

26:39.920 --> 26:45.360
supposed to be teaching. These are all things that ancient Anatolians were quite capable of

26:45.360 --> 26:51.520
doing themselves. It's kind of like a super advanced race of aliens descending on my town

26:51.520 --> 26:57.440
and teaching us all how to make ravioli and mow the lawn. Gee thanks, but I'm good.

26:58.400 --> 27:02.960
Hancock only comes up with one technology he thinks was transferred,

27:02.960 --> 27:04.960
for which he provides no evidence.

27:06.160 --> 27:10.160
There was no agriculture at Gobekli Tepe when it was built, he says,

27:10.160 --> 27:16.960
but strangely, at exactly the time that it was being created, 11,600 years ago, agriculture

27:16.960 --> 27:23.360
appears all around it. For me, what the evidence speaks to is pretty clear. It's a transfer of

27:23.440 --> 27:29.840
technology. Or it speaks to a claim directly contradicted by the evidence and even what

27:29.840 --> 27:36.080
Hancock is told in his own programme. Archaeologists have found no evidence of agriculture around

27:36.080 --> 27:42.720
Gobekli Tepe 11,600 years ago. Geneticists have carbon dated the earliest known cultivated

27:42.720 --> 27:49.760
strains of wheat in the area in a village around 20 miles away to 10,500 years ago,

27:49.760 --> 27:54.800
a thousand years after construction started. Hancock goes on to say,

27:55.440 --> 28:01.440
they, that's the advanced lost civilisation, already had knowledge of agriculture and they

28:01.440 --> 28:07.920
used that site to mobilise a local community, to organise them and to introduce them to agriculture.

28:08.800 --> 28:14.960
In that case, why were the people of Gobekli Tepe still eating what they could gather in the wild

28:14.960 --> 28:21.440
rather than the produce of these alleged farms gifted by an advanced civilisation? And why were

28:21.440 --> 28:27.520
they hunting gazelle, vultures and other wild animals rather than domesticated sheep and goats?

28:28.320 --> 28:34.480
Hancock even repeats what an archaeologist confirms in the Netflix programme. They found no

28:34.480 --> 28:40.000
evidence of farming, Hancock says. The people who built this complex were definitely still

28:40.000 --> 28:47.120
hunter gatherers. And he says it again, they are hunter gatherers. So it's not much of a transfer

28:47.120 --> 28:52.480
of technology if people from this region completely ignored the technology and carried

28:52.480 --> 28:58.560
on doing what they had always been doing. If we look even further afield, there's no evidence

28:58.560 --> 29:05.760
that agriculture suddenly appeared elsewhere at this time. Cultivation was a long, slow and fitful

29:05.840 --> 29:12.080
process. The rest of the programme is speculation about star alignments and carved symbols,

29:12.080 --> 29:16.640
and people often complain that I post these transcripts with not enough time to read them,

29:16.640 --> 29:21.280
if only there was some kind of a pause button on your computer, like a space bar,

29:21.280 --> 29:24.960
that would stop the video for as long as you need to read them. Oh dear, too late.

29:26.080 --> 29:32.320
There are lots of coulds and maybes and what ifs related to cherry picks of the eclectic mix of

29:32.320 --> 29:38.080
carved wild animals, penises, pillars, all of different ages, and the various alignments that

29:38.080 --> 29:42.560
fit various theories. Could all those animal carvings actually be telling us something?

29:42.560 --> 29:47.280
But are they serpents or could they represent something else? Could Gobekli Tepe be even more

29:47.280 --> 29:52.080
than that? What if its architects sought to leave behind a message of the greatest importance? What

29:52.080 --> 29:56.800
if this mysterious complex wasn't just a place of rituals? What if it's more than that? Is it

29:56.800 --> 30:01.520
possible they share a common inspiration? Is it possible that the great building projects in both

30:01.520 --> 30:05.520
places are perhaps represented by those stone pillars? So we can take that perhaps to be

30:05.520 --> 30:10.800
Scorpius. Symbols on the stone might represent asterisms. But I'm not really interested in

30:10.800 --> 30:17.440
speculation. I'm only interested in what we can establish as fact. It would be great if believers

30:17.440 --> 30:22.320
in the lost civilisation could come here and do something that Hancock didn't manage to do,

30:22.320 --> 30:28.800
provide just one piece of tangible evidence that links the builders of Gobekli Tepe to an advanced

30:28.800 --> 30:35.600
lost civilisation. It wasn't farming, it wasn't some kind of advanced tool making, it wasn't

30:35.600 --> 30:42.160
stone moving. So what was it? I made a similar appeal at the end of my last video after I showed

30:42.160 --> 30:49.280
how the only evidence Hancock produced in episode one had been fabricated. So I would love to hear

30:49.280 --> 30:54.880
from Hancock fans to see what you think. Please don't just write comments saying my video is

30:54.880 --> 31:01.120
bullshit or it's an ad hominem attack against Hancock. I'm not judging his eloquent speaking

31:01.120 --> 31:06.960
voice, his intelligence or his personality. What I'm concerned with are the fabrications and the

31:06.960 --> 31:13.520
omissions. So please address that. But all I got in response were tirades against archaeologists,

31:13.520 --> 31:19.760
lots of whatabouts of course, and most bizarrely, lots of complaints that it was outrageous to even

31:19.760 --> 31:25.600
question and fact check Hancock's claims. You knock Graham Hancock, you put him down,

31:25.600 --> 31:30.480
you should be ashamed of yourself for attacking, dismissing and smearing his work. Hancock haters

31:30.480 --> 31:37.200
piling on, trying to put Hancock down, a hit piece. The funny thing was that no one disagreed

31:37.200 --> 31:42.720
that Hancock had fabricated his evidence and they didn't even try to defend it. What they

31:42.720 --> 31:49.040
objected to was me showing these fabrications on a public forum, either because it undermined his

31:49.040 --> 31:56.320
work or because exposing fakery is somehow a personal attack. So I'm not optimistic that

31:56.320 --> 32:02.560
anyone will try to defend Hancock's fabrications and omissions in episode five either. But please

32:02.560 --> 32:08.720
do try. As always, I'm more than willing to correct my video if I got something wrong.

32:10.080 --> 32:14.800
At the same time, I was very encouraged to see that a lot of people were prepared to look a bit

32:14.800 --> 32:20.640
more closely at Hancock's evidence and changed their minds once they realised that a lot of it

32:20.640 --> 32:25.760
was fabricated and that there's a lot of contradictory evidence that was missing from

32:25.760 --> 32:32.640
his programme. Now, you may well ask, but what harm do these innocent beliefs in a lost civilisation

32:32.640 --> 32:38.560
do? Surely they're not hurting anyone, are they? Well, on a practical level, the problem is

32:38.560 --> 32:44.640
exemplified by what happened at Gunung Padang, where Hancock imagined there was secret rectangular

32:45.440 --> 32:51.600
underneath a megalithic site, which he claimed is a 20,000-year-old pyramid. I covered that in my

32:51.600 --> 32:57.680
last video. Other people believed this too, including the then President of Indonesia,

32:57.680 --> 33:04.800
Bambang Yuliyono. Because if it was true, then Indonesia would be home to the oldest civilisation

33:04.800 --> 33:11.760
in the world. So of course, it became a source of immense national pride. So much so that the

33:11.760 --> 33:17.360
President assigned a large budget and encouraged digging underneath the site to reveal this

33:17.360 --> 33:25.360
supposed lost civilisation. And this had two unfortunate effects. First, it diverted funds

33:25.360 --> 33:31.280
from real archaeological investigations, such as the nearby Paoan Cave site, which had been

33:31.280 --> 33:38.400
home to hunter-gatherers about 9,500 years ago. Excavations here tell us far more about the people

33:38.400 --> 33:45.360
who lived at that time than made-up TV stories about ancient pyramid builders. Secondly, with

33:45.360 --> 33:51.760
the President's backing, an army of around 500 untrained volunteers came to dig up the site and

33:51.760 --> 33:57.840
get to the lost civilisation they believed was buried underneath, even though telemetry showed

33:57.840 --> 34:04.320
that this was just an extinct volcano with no evidence of any man-made structures. The project

34:04.320 --> 34:09.520
was called the Red and White Glory Operation, named after the colours of the Indonesian flag.

34:10.240 --> 34:16.160
To speed things along, President Yuliyono even sent in soldiers to help and offered earth-moving

34:16.160 --> 34:22.160
equipment. Archaeologists, of course, were horrified. One of their complaints was that

34:22.160 --> 34:28.880
the soldiers and untrained amateurs were using hoes – no, this type of hoe – to hack at the ground

34:28.880 --> 34:33.520
and were removing megalithic stones with no record of where they had been laid.

34:34.240 --> 34:40.560
A World Heritage site was in danger of being vandalised. Fortunately, when a new President

34:40.560 --> 34:46.080
was elected, he stopped the uncontrolled dig and preserved the site for future generations.

34:47.040 --> 34:51.840
Now, I have no doubt that there will be comments that this is censorship. Archaeologists are just

34:51.840 --> 34:58.480
jealous. They are trying to hush up evidence of a lost civilisation, etc. etc. But imagine

34:58.480 --> 35:04.160
the outrage if a gullible Prime Minister of the UK – I'm not pointing fingers, this generic

35:04.160 --> 35:09.920
silhouette could be any dim-witted British Prime Minister – believed stories on TV about buried

35:09.920 --> 35:16.240
treasure under Stonehenge, and recruited an army of shovel-wielding patriots to go and dig it up.

35:17.120 --> 35:22.240
I wonder what the reaction would be. But apart from all the practical effects of

35:22.240 --> 35:27.680
spreading these myths, surely there's a matter of principle involved. Do we really want to

35:27.680 --> 35:33.680
teach our children history based on fabrications and phony evidence? I mean, it's sometimes

35:33.680 --> 35:39.920
wonderful for instilling national pride, but it can also be sinister and destructive. Are we

35:39.920 --> 35:45.680
really willing to say it's OK to fabricate evidence and that exposing these fabrications

35:45.680 --> 35:50.640
is hateful? Really? Is that the lesson we want our children to learn?
