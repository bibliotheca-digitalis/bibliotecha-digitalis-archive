0	5280	This is just a follow-up to my video on the first episode of Graham Hancock's Netflix series.
5840	11280	I'm going to look at some of the responses I received, and in answer to some of those posts,
11280	16160	I'll take a look in this video at Hancock's claims about Gobekli Tepe,
16160	20240	which is one of the world's oldest construction sites now in Turkey.
21280	27760	We'll see how this guy can move huge 20-tonne stone blocks all on his own, and we'll see why
27760	32720	an innocent belief in lost civilisations can have real-world consequences.
33600	39760	In my last video, I found lots of fabrications just in that first episode. Unfortunately,
39760	43280	fans of Graham Hancock didn't want to talk about episode one.
43840	50800	Quite understandably, they asked what about episode seven, or episode three, or five?
50800	56400	What about all the things he didn't cover like Gobekli Tepe, or Bimini Road, or water erosion
56400	62240	around the Sphinx, or Lidar findings in the Amazon, or Gobekli Tepe, or the Sphinx, or Clovis
62240	69360	First, or Gobekli Tepe, or Lidar and Stuff, or the Sphinx, or Gobekli Tepe, or Nothing Before Clovis,
69360	75040	or 10-tonne blocks, or the Malta episode, or Bimini Road, or Gobekli Tepe?
75600	80960	Why didn't I start with episode five? Because when faced with a Netflix series,
80960	86960	I usually tend to start at episode one. But hey, that's just me. I don't live by the
86960	94160	conventional rules of society. I'm a rebel. The way I deal with predictable what about responses
94160	101360	is to say I'll deal with just one what about, so give it your best shot. In this case, there were
101360	107120	so many what abouts that the fairest thing to do was address the most popular of them, which is
107120	113680	what about Gobekli Tepe in episode five? For time and copyright reasons, I'm not going to
113680	120080	show the clips. I'll use the transcript instead. It's interesting that without the dramatic music
120080	126720	and the triggering images, the lost civilisation narrative looks even less convincing. And please
126720	132800	note that just like last time, I have zero interest in Hancock's personality, because
132800	138560	this is not about his personality or my personality. Thanks for your interest. It's
138560	144960	about the facts. We'll start with a claim I've already debunked. Referring to the Younger Dryas
144960	151040	period around 12,000 years ago, Graham says, the world suffered through some kind of tremendous
151040	158080	geological upheaval, including immense floods. But Hancock fans who watched my previous video
158080	163520	already know that those immense floods never happened. The Younger Dryas sea level rise that
163520	169120	Graham referred to was only around half an inch a year, and not very different to the rise in
169120	174640	sea levels that had been going on for thousands of years before, and continued for thousands of
174640	181680	years after the Younger Dryas. And none of his fans disagreed. In episode five, the one on Gobekli
181680	189360	Tepe, Hancock continues, and around 11,600 years ago the freeze ended with another final immense
189360	197200	flood that raised sea levels around the world. No, there was no immense flood 11,600 years ago
197200	203680	either. If there had been, and Hancock's talking about a global flood, it would show up in the
203680	210240	stratigraphy. All floods leave a record. Every large tsunami leaves a record. If you've ever
210240	215840	had a house flooded you'll be familiar with the film of scum and mud and general debris
215840	221920	it leaves behind. Flood deposits are easily recognisable in core samples taken from lakes
221920	229040	and swamps. So episode five is no different to episode one in fabricating, that means making up,
229040	234960	a series of immense and imaginary deluges, and even adding another one with a specific date.
235840	241120	The other thing I quickly discovered is that episode five is no different to episode one
241120	246800	in its derogatory depiction of archaeologists and the misrepresentation of their conclusions.
247760	253360	In southeastern Turkey, near modern-day Sanliurfa, something remarkable happened around the end of
253360	259120	the last ice age, Hancock says. Our Stone Age hunter-gatherer ancestors suddenly discovered
259120	265920	farming and began creating settlements. This of course is nonsense according to archaeological
265920	273120	evidence gathered over the last 30 years, as we'll see. But if you look down it seems clear
273120	279200	Hancock isn't trying to give us his belief, he thinks he's giving us the view of archaeologists.
280240	285440	Now I'm sure this is what Graham Hancock learned in elementary school back in the 60s,
285440	292240	because I learned the same thing. That's why it's about 60 years out of date. No serious
292240	298240	archaeologist these days thinks hunter-gatherers suddenly discovered farming and began creating
298240	303920	settlements. But that view of history now cries out to be rewritten, Hancock says.
305040	311440	Actually it was rewritten over three decades ago. There have been hundreds of discoveries since the
311440	318320	1960s showing that hunter-gatherer societies were not what Graham calls simple and unsophisticated
318320	324640	people. As I said in my last video they had societies, culture, trade, language, art,
324640	331280	and yes even construction. They didn't suddenly discover farming, it was a transition that took
331280	337600	thousands of years. As for Gobekli Tepe itself, based on everything we've been taught about
337600	344080	prehistory, Graham says it shouldn't exist. That would only be true if science was the
344080	349360	same as religion, where the conclusion is an immutable belief that can't be overturned.
350080	356720	In religion, or any kind of dogma, evidence is changed to be consistent with the dogmatic
356720	362720	conclusion. We saw that in episode one. According to the lost civilisation belief,
362720	368560	coral pillars at Nan Madol shouldn't exist, so they were changed to man-made pillars.
369760	375040	In science, it's the other way round. The conclusion has to be changed to be consistent
375040	380560	with the evidence. There's a wonderful clip of creationist Ian Juby getting frustrated
380560	386160	at how scientists change their conclusions about evolution every time they find new evidence.
387120	403600	But that's precisely science. That's why archaeologists never deal with new evidence
403600	410080	by saying it shouldn't exist, they simply change their understanding of the past, their conclusions
410080	414640	in light of it. That's why the conclusion that there was nothing older than Clovis in
414640	420960	North America was changed when archaeologists discovered pre-Clovis artefacts, the understanding
420960	426160	that there were no settlements in the Amazon was overturned when Lidar discovered settlements in
426160	431920	the Amazon, and the understanding that Mesolithic hunter-gatherers didn't build large structures
431920	437680	was overturned when archaeologists discovered Gobekli Tepe. None of these discoveries
437680	443440	contradict our understanding of history, they only contradict our previous understanding of history.
444000	450000	As Ian Juby noted, conclusions in archaeology, like all sciences, change to be consistent with
450000	456560	the latest evidence. If archaeologists were stuck in dogma and never changed, as Hancock claims,
456560	460720	we'd still be stuck with the archaeology that he and I learned in the 1960s.
461680	468000	Now, in anticipation of the post that some of you are already writing, of course there are a lot of
468000	474240	fusty old archaeology professors with fixed ideas, just like in all sciences. Anyone who thinks
474240	480000	otherwise hasn't watched my channel, where I'm constantly correcting old professors and PhDs
480000	485440	who cling to dogmatic beliefs. But even the most dogmatic and determined professor,
485440	489920	who told his students that nothing would be found below the Clovis layer in North America,
489920	494800	had to eat his words when archaeologists did find artefacts below the Clovis layer.
495440	500720	And please note, before you rewrite that furious post, this doesn't mean that the lost
500720	506320	civilisation belief must be true on the basis that our understanding of history always changes.
507040	512800	Because our understanding changes based on evidence, not a belief dreamed up in an armchair
512800	519200	and then made into a popular TV programme. Sorry, but fake and fabricated evidence doesn't count.
519760	524000	It may convince a Netflix audience, but it doesn't impress scientific journals.
525120	531280	The next attempt to undermine archaeology is this. Archaeologists accept that it dates back
531280	538560	to around 11,600 years ago. No, archaeologists don't accept the fact that it dates back to
538560	545520	around 11,600 years ago. Archaeologists are telling us that it dates back to around that time.
546400	551760	They were the ones who did the painstaking study dating it all. It's their conclusion.
552720	558560	So why the rather odd wording? As I said in my last video, it's all about
558560	562480	impressions and images. Graham could have simply said,
562480	569520	archaeologists dated the site to around 11,600 years ago. Perfectly true. But that makes it
569520	576160	look like archaeologists are making discoveries and not sticking rigidly to orthodoxy. So it
576160	581600	doesn't fit the narrative of dogmatic, dumb archaeologists who have to be reluctantly
581600	587440	dragged into accepting something that lost civilisation believers readily understand.
588800	592800	Slipping the word accept makes it sound as though someone else did the dating
592800	599600	and archaeologists grudgingly went along with it. The wording is no accident. In the media,
599600	603200	words are carefully thought out to convey a particular standpoint.
603840	608640	For example, look at the difference here, imagining a 17th century report about
608640	613920	Galileo's discovery of the moons of Jupiter. The straightforward version would be,
613920	620800	Galileo discovers that Jupiter has moons. Now contrast that with Galileo accepts
620800	626880	that Jupiter has moons. See the difference? Journalists can make the insinuation even
626880	631920	more damning by saying Galileo admits that Jupiter has moons.
633040	639600	It's just one manipulation of the audience, but little by little each line builds up this picture
639600	644080	of Graham being out in front and archaeologists sticking to old ideas.
645360	651600	The reality is that archaeologists not only dated this site, they hailed it as a breakthrough in our
651600	657600	understanding of hunter-gatherer societies. Archaeology was rewritten. If they weren't
657600	662800	advanced enough to design and build this megalithic wonder, he says, who did and why?
663520	668960	But who says they weren't advanced enough? Certainly no one who has researched the site.
668960	674640	This assumption that they weren't advanced enough is so dogmatic that it doesn't even look at the
674640	680000	clear evidence against this. The programme goes straight to the assumption that this must be the
680000	687360	work of someone else. In the form of a question, of course, because hey, just asking. I showed
687360	692400	this technique of slipping an unsupported assumption into a question in my last video.
693120	698080	Take a look if you haven't seen it, because it's a very popular advertising formula
698080	704400	and we need to be on our guard against it. Notice also how Graham again uses trigger words,
704400	708880	just as we saw in the last video, to build an image in his audience's heads.
710000	715200	Built at a time when the earth was just emerging from the last ice age, when locals were still
715200	722160	supposedly unsophisticated hunter-gatherers living in mud huts. But if they weren't advanced enough
722160	729200	to design and build this megalithic wonder, who did and why? Since his aim is to downgrade
729200	736320	Mesolithic hunter-gatherers and upgrade Gobekli Tepe, he uses words like simple, unsophisticated
736320	742880	and mud huts to describe the former and words like wonder and highly sophisticated and highly
742880	750400	advanced to describe the latter. So let's lose all the trigger words and the emotional baggage
750400	754720	and look at how difficult it might have been to build Gobekli Tepe.
756240	762000	First, why would they build the site in the first place? Archaeologists say the most likely answer
762000	768640	is a spiritual or ceremonial meeting place and this isn't unusual. Hunter-gatherer societies
768640	773920	had widespread connections during the Mesolithic and there's evidence they often came together in
773920	779920	sacred places for feasting and trading and no doubt for matchmaking and ceremonial worship.
780640	785840	Australian aborigines used to do it, Plains Indians used to do it and clearly the people
785840	790960	of Anatolia used to do it. And if you think it's far-fetched to suppose that people would
790960	796880	put so much time and effort into a structure that was purely ceremonial and spiritual,
796880	801280	just look at how much time and effort was put into building the beautiful,
801280	808880	yet arguably pointless cathedrals of Europe. The exact nature of their religion is hard to fathom
808880	814400	but evidence suggests that it may have started as a cemetery, a place on top of a hill where
814400	820400	the dead were brought and their skulls defleshed and hung up. And the evidence shows that each
820400	826640	stage of the building was deliberately buried and then restarted but again we don't know why.
828000	833520	Next comes the planning. The first three enclosures of Göbekli Tepe are laid out on an
833520	839040	equilateral triangle, which is fascinating from an archaeological point of view because prior to
839040	844800	this discovery the earliest dates when geometry was known to be part of the human thought process
844800	851280	was 10,000 years ago. So now we know the earliest date is 11,500 years ago.
852240	854800	But from the point of view of an ancient civilisation,
861920	866400	there's no reason why hunter-gatherers couldn't have made an equilateral triangle.
866400	872000	All it takes is a long rope, which they had, divided into three parts and pegged out.
872000	873760	But it's a nice triangle.
873760	880640	Third, cutting the stones. What they made around 11,500 years ago was several enclosures
880640	886400	ringed by pillars brought in from a nearby limestone quarry. This is one of the T-shaped
886400	891680	pillars they were cutting out, around seven metres long, which for some reason they left in the
891680	899520	ground. So we can see the quarrying process itself. How did they cut the stones? Surprisingly,
899600	905360	he is in tools made of flint, which have been found all over the site. This kind of limestone
905360	912240	is relatively soft, and flint is hard. So cutting it isn't a problem, and the limestone slabs are
912240	918400	naturally faltered along vertical and horizontal lines, so as long as each side was cut away,
918400	924320	the stone was free to move. I was curious to see how Graham explained these rather
924320	931680	less than advanced flint tools, and the answer is, of course, he doesn't. As we saw in episode 1,
931680	937440	any evidence that doesn't fit the story of an advanced civilisation is simply not mentioned.
938480	943760	As for transporting the stones, that's not difficult either. There are many ways of
943760	953280	moving large stones. A sled, wrapped in a roller, walked along, pulled on a rail.
953840	959760	As I said in my last video, all it takes is rope, a few simple tools, lots of people,
959760	966880	and organisation. By the way, there's a great video showing how just one guy can move huge,
966880	974080	twenty tonne stone blocks all on his own, using simple cradles and pivot points. One small stone
974080	980560	underneath a large block, and he can turn it single handed. Two stones, and he can make it move.
981440	988160	Wally Wallington here also shows how just one man can raise a huge block by rocking it back and
988160	994080	forwards, like a teeter totter, and putting wooden blocks under the middle each time one side lifts
994080	1000880	up. And once it's raised up, it's a simple matter of leaning and pulling to slip it into a pit,
1000880	1008240	and then to the vertical. So far, nothing suggests that these supposedly unsophisticated hunter
1008240	1013600	gatherers, living in mud huts as Graham calls them, weren't advanced enough to cut stones
1013600	1019920	with flint tools and move them. The only question is how these people sustained themselves.
1020800	1026240	After all, farming societies can store grain and livestock and sustain a workforce on large
1026240	1031840	projects. So if large numbers of hunter gatherers stayed in one place during the construction of
1031840	1037200	Gobekli Tepe, wouldn't they very quickly have exhausted everything they could hunt and gather
1037200	1043840	in the area? Here again, the evidence is changing our understanding of how hunter gatherer societies
1043840	1051520	lived, at least in that region at that time. According to a study by Dietrich et al. in 2019,
1052160	1058400	handstones, pestles and mortars, grinding slabs and bowls were found at the site, all related
1058400	1065920	to processing wild cereals that had been gathered. As for the hunting part, 60% of the butchered
1065920	1071920	bones found at the site were gazelle. The other bones came from wild asses, no jokes please,
1072560	1080560	vultures, cranes, ducks and geese. And everything suggests that the building was seasonal and the
1080560	1086240	hunter gatherers collected in that place at a time when gazelle were passing through in migratory
1086240	1093360	herds and food was plentiful. The evidence clearly shows that Gobekli Tepe was built long before
1093360	1099920	agriculture and animal domestication. The Netflix programme doesn't even look at this evidence.
1099920	1106320	It ignored it in favour of a familiar rhetorical technique. Give two people two choices, one of
1106320	1112080	them your own belief and the other a far more absurd option, and ask them to choose which one
1112080	1118880	makes more sense. Isn't it time to consider the possibility that the great megalithic enclosures
1118880	1125600	weren't some miraculous overnight invention of hunter gatherers, Graham asks, but were a legacy
1125600	1132000	from a precociously advanced lost civilisation of prehistory? This is an ocean which mainstream
1132000	1139120	archaeologists find almost offensive. They don't find the idea offensive as far as I know,
1139120	1144400	it's just that Hancock's ideas have been considered. There are numerous archaeologists
1144400	1149200	who have looked at them, and they have been rejected for reasons I showed in the previous
1149200	1155680	video, namely that a lot of the evidence for them has been fabricated, and there's no evidence that
1155680	1162160	supports them, and a mountain of evidence that directly contradicts them. The idea that Gobekli
1162160	1168880	Tepe suddenly miraculously sprung up overnight, to paraphrase Graham, has also been rejected,
1168880	1175600	because again the evidence shows that it didn't. But these are the only two options we're given.
1176560	1182080	It's a common technique called a false dichotomy. I've shown this before when a Golden Crocoduck
1182080	1188080	nominee, Brock Lee, used the same technique to divert attention from the idea that a hammer
1188080	1194640	encased in sediment was the result of a well-known process called accretion. Just don't give the
1194640	1199680	audience that option. Hypothesis one, the creation one, maybe dinosaurs and man live together and
1199680	1206320	these are just artifacts from before the flood. Possibility two, maybe aliens came here, dropped
1206320	1210880	off these hammers, and then a Tyrannosaurus rex had to evolve human-like fingers to pick up all
1210880	1216320	of these artifacts being left by the aliens. How many of you think the creation, the biblical view
1216320	1221360	of humans and dinosaurs living together is more likely? And my kids used to do it when I refused
1221360	1225840	to buy them candy in the supermarket. Do you want me to starve to death, they'd say?
1226640	1232000	They assumed that when Dad was faced with the choice between candy and death, he'd very
1232000	1238480	sensibly choose to buy the candy. What they didn't count on was Dad's cunning ability to spot a third
1238480	1246080	option, wait for dinner. Archaeologists find this simplistic choice between two unsupported ideas
1246080	1252080	not offensive, that's too strong a word, but laughable because it completely omits the third
1252080	1258800	and most obvious option that Gobekli Tepe was part of a learning curve just like any other building.
1260240	1265840	For example, if a future race of intelligent apes came across the remains of St Paul's Cathedral
1265840	1272400	and little else, they might well conclude that it came out of nowhere overnight. They'd argue
1272400	1276880	it's impossible for people at that time to suddenly acquire the skills and the knowledge
1276880	1282880	to build something so incredible, so surely the only option is that wise men from a great
1282880	1288080	civilisation must have descended on London, built the Cathedral and then gone home again.
1289600	1294640	But if you look at the wider context, you can see that St Paul's didn't spring up out of nowhere.
1295440	1301280	Excavations further afield would reveal how buildings got larger and more complex over
1301280	1307760	hundreds of years. You can clearly see a learning curve as builders copied old techniques and
1307760	1313920	discovered new ones, sometimes learning from failures as often as successes. For example,
1313920	1319760	flying buttresses at St Paul's were an innovation that developed after the failure of unsupported
1319760	1327120	walls at the Hagia Sophia in Istanbul hundreds of years earlier. Dig below St Paul's and you'll
1327120	1332880	find the remains of an older Cathedral underneath, and further down still you'll see the remains of
1332880	1340000	the old Roman settlement on Ludgate Hill. Future archaeologists can find the quarries and see how
1340000	1347200	the stones were cut and transported. All of this context shows that St Paul's didn't just spring
1347200	1353920	out of nowhere overnight, nor did it require an ancient civilisation sailing in from somewhere
1353920	1360880	else. Having presented his two options, Hancock then dismisses one of them as completely absurd.
1361440	1366640	You can't just wake up one morning with no prior skills, no prior knowledge, no background in
1366640	1373440	working with stone and create something like Gobekli Tepe, he argues. And that only leaves us
1373440	1380400	with, what luck, the option of his lost civilisation. But hang on a minute. For once
1380400	1387840	archaeologists and Hancock are in agreement, this is a completely absurd option. So let's get rid of
1387840	1393200	the false dichotomy and replace that nonsense option with the more realistic and sensible
1393200	1399840	option proposed by archaeologists, that ancient Anatolians started on a smaller scale and worked
1399840	1405840	their way up. And it took them around 1,500 years to build the entire site.
1405840	1410720	There has to be a long history behind it, continues Hancock,
1410720	1417280	and that history is completely missing. And to me it very strongly speaks of a lost civilisation.
1418240	1424080	Or it speaks very strongly of the fact that the long history is missing from the Netflix programme.
1425040	1430800	If you look at Gobekli Tepe in the wider context, as we did with St Paul's Cathedral, the evidence
1430800	1435680	suggests that there was prior knowledge and there was a background of working with stone,
1435680	1441760	going back at least 2,000 years before Gobekli Tepe. It just didn't fit the idea of a lost
1441760	1449120	civilisation, so it wasn't mentioned. There are dozens of sites, either being excavated
1449120	1455040	or waiting to be excavated in the region, and Gobekli Tepe didn't remain the oldest site for long.
1456000	1462720	Bonjour Cloutala, about 200km to the east of Gobekli Tepe, is estimated to have been built
1462720	1468160	up to 1,000 years earlier. Archaeologists have found that it was built in stages,
1468160	1473360	starting with a small temple in the middle, in which four limestone blocks stand upright
1473360	1479280	in the earth floor. And there are sites even older than that. Pinabasi Hooyuk dates back to
1479280	1486320	around 16,000 years ago. It's a burial site and found so recently that I can't even find any
1486320	1490960	scientific studies on it. But there was an announcement from the Turkish Ministry of
1490960	1498320	Culture and Tourism last year, with photos that show small arrangements of stones 2,500 years
1498320	1505280	older than Gobekli Tepe. The flint tools also have to be looked at in a wider context. There's
1505280	1511040	no flint or obsidian in the Gobekli Tepe plateau, so it was brought in from further afield.
1511920	1516640	Archaeologists have discovered a network of flint and obsidian trade from around that time,
1517280	1524160	reaching as far away as Georgia in the Caucasus. The style of flint shaping, called napping,
1524160	1529760	differs according to the different cultures from around the region who gathered at Gobekli Tepe.
1531120	1536320	So by looking at Gobekli Tepe in context, there's more than enough evidence to support
1536320	1542720	the conclusion that it was part of a learning curve, just like St Paul's Cathedral. Archaeologists
1542720	1549440	are still literally just scratching the surface, but what little they've found so far is consistent
1549440	1556160	with stone construction that began very crudely and simply and grew in size and complexity
1556160	1563040	over thousands of years. So what evidence is there for what Hancock considers to be the only option?
1563840	1568560	There's no evidence of any outside influence or advanced technology in the region at that time.
1569520	1573120	Hancock says they transferred their technology and their skills.
1574000	1579200	If so, what technology and which skills? Or to put it another way…
1580880	1587360	That's a very good question. Did they teach them how to hunt gazelle? Or how to deflesh skulls?
1587360	1593840	How to make flint axes? How to cut and move stones? Or how to pick wild grains and crush them?
1594720	1599920	If so, it doesn't sound like these outsiders were any more advanced than the people they were
1599920	1605360	supposed to be teaching. These are all things that ancient Anatolians were quite capable of
1605360	1611520	doing themselves. It's kind of like a super advanced race of aliens descending on my town
1611520	1617440	and teaching us all how to make ravioli and mow the lawn. Gee thanks, but I'm good.
1618400	1622960	Hancock only comes up with one technology he thinks was transferred,
1622960	1624960	for which he provides no evidence.
1626160	1630160	There was no agriculture at Gobekli Tepe when it was built, he says,
1630160	1636960	but strangely, at exactly the time that it was being created, 11,600 years ago, agriculture
1636960	1643360	appears all around it. For me, what the evidence speaks to is pretty clear. It's a transfer of
1643440	1649840	technology. Or it speaks to a claim directly contradicted by the evidence and even what
1649840	1656080	Hancock is told in his own programme. Archaeologists have found no evidence of agriculture around
1656080	1662720	Gobekli Tepe 11,600 years ago. Geneticists have carbon dated the earliest known cultivated
1662720	1669760	strains of wheat in the area in a village around 20 miles away to 10,500 years ago,
1669760	1674800	a thousand years after construction started. Hancock goes on to say,
1675440	1681440	they, that's the advanced lost civilisation, already had knowledge of agriculture and they
1681440	1687920	used that site to mobilise a local community, to organise them and to introduce them to agriculture.
1688800	1694960	In that case, why were the people of Gobekli Tepe still eating what they could gather in the wild
1694960	1701440	rather than the produce of these alleged farms gifted by an advanced civilisation? And why were
1701440	1707520	they hunting gazelle, vultures and other wild animals rather than domesticated sheep and goats?
1708320	1714480	Hancock even repeats what an archaeologist confirms in the Netflix programme. They found no
1714480	1720000	evidence of farming, Hancock says. The people who built this complex were definitely still
1720000	1727120	hunter gatherers. And he says it again, they are hunter gatherers. So it's not much of a transfer
1727120	1732480	of technology if people from this region completely ignored the technology and carried
1732480	1738560	on doing what they had always been doing. If we look even further afield, there's no evidence
1738560	1745760	that agriculture suddenly appeared elsewhere at this time. Cultivation was a long, slow and fitful
1745840	1752080	process. The rest of the programme is speculation about star alignments and carved symbols,
1752080	1756640	and people often complain that I post these transcripts with not enough time to read them,
1756640	1761280	if only there was some kind of a pause button on your computer, like a space bar,
1761280	1764960	that would stop the video for as long as you need to read them. Oh dear, too late.
1766080	1772320	There are lots of coulds and maybes and what ifs related to cherry picks of the eclectic mix of
1772320	1778080	carved wild animals, penises, pillars, all of different ages, and the various alignments that
1778080	1782560	fit various theories. Could all those animal carvings actually be telling us something?
1782560	1787280	But are they serpents or could they represent something else? Could Gobekli Tepe be even more
1787280	1792080	than that? What if its architects sought to leave behind a message of the greatest importance? What
1792080	1796800	if this mysterious complex wasn't just a place of rituals? What if it's more than that? Is it
1796800	1801520	possible they share a common inspiration? Is it possible that the great building projects in both
1801520	1805520	places are perhaps represented by those stone pillars? So we can take that perhaps to be
1805520	1810800	Scorpius. Symbols on the stone might represent asterisms. But I'm not really interested in
1810800	1817440	speculation. I'm only interested in what we can establish as fact. It would be great if believers
1817440	1822320	in the lost civilisation could come here and do something that Hancock didn't manage to do,
1822320	1828800	provide just one piece of tangible evidence that links the builders of Gobekli Tepe to an advanced
1828800	1835600	lost civilisation. It wasn't farming, it wasn't some kind of advanced tool making, it wasn't
1835600	1842160	stone moving. So what was it? I made a similar appeal at the end of my last video after I showed
1842160	1849280	how the only evidence Hancock produced in episode one had been fabricated. So I would love to hear
1849280	1854880	from Hancock fans to see what you think. Please don't just write comments saying my video is
1854880	1861120	bullshit or it's an ad hominem attack against Hancock. I'm not judging his eloquent speaking
1861120	1866960	voice, his intelligence or his personality. What I'm concerned with are the fabrications and the
1866960	1873520	omissions. So please address that. But all I got in response were tirades against archaeologists,
1873520	1879760	lots of whatabouts of course, and most bizarrely, lots of complaints that it was outrageous to even
1879760	1885600	question and fact check Hancock's claims. You knock Graham Hancock, you put him down,
1885600	1890480	you should be ashamed of yourself for attacking, dismissing and smearing his work. Hancock haters
1890480	1897200	piling on, trying to put Hancock down, a hit piece. The funny thing was that no one disagreed
1897200	1902720	that Hancock had fabricated his evidence and they didn't even try to defend it. What they
1902720	1909040	objected to was me showing these fabrications on a public forum, either because it undermined his
1909040	1916320	work or because exposing fakery is somehow a personal attack. So I'm not optimistic that
1916320	1922560	anyone will try to defend Hancock's fabrications and omissions in episode five either. But please
1922560	1928720	do try. As always, I'm more than willing to correct my video if I got something wrong.
1930080	1934800	At the same time, I was very encouraged to see that a lot of people were prepared to look a bit
1934800	1940640	more closely at Hancock's evidence and changed their minds once they realised that a lot of it
1940640	1945760	was fabricated and that there's a lot of contradictory evidence that was missing from
1945760	1952640	his programme. Now, you may well ask, but what harm do these innocent beliefs in a lost civilisation
1952640	1958560	do? Surely they're not hurting anyone, are they? Well, on a practical level, the problem is
1958560	1964640	exemplified by what happened at Gunung Padang, where Hancock imagined there was secret rectangular
1965440	1971600	underneath a megalithic site, which he claimed is a 20,000-year-old pyramid. I covered that in my
1971600	1977680	last video. Other people believed this too, including the then President of Indonesia,
1977680	1984800	Bambang Yuliyono. Because if it was true, then Indonesia would be home to the oldest civilisation
1984800	1991760	in the world. So of course, it became a source of immense national pride. So much so that the
1991760	1997360	President assigned a large budget and encouraged digging underneath the site to reveal this
1997360	2005360	supposed lost civilisation. And this had two unfortunate effects. First, it diverted funds
2005360	2011280	from real archaeological investigations, such as the nearby Paoan Cave site, which had been
2011280	2018400	home to hunter-gatherers about 9,500 years ago. Excavations here tell us far more about the people
2018400	2025360	who lived at that time than made-up TV stories about ancient pyramid builders. Secondly, with
2025360	2031760	the President's backing, an army of around 500 untrained volunteers came to dig up the site and
2031760	2037840	get to the lost civilisation they believed was buried underneath, even though telemetry showed
2037840	2044320	that this was just an extinct volcano with no evidence of any man-made structures. The project
2044320	2049520	was called the Red and White Glory Operation, named after the colours of the Indonesian flag.
2050240	2056160	To speed things along, President Yuliyono even sent in soldiers to help and offered earth-moving
2056160	2062160	equipment. Archaeologists, of course, were horrified. One of their complaints was that
2062160	2068880	the soldiers and untrained amateurs were using hoes – no, this type of hoe – to hack at the ground
2068880	2073520	and were removing megalithic stones with no record of where they had been laid.
2074240	2080560	A World Heritage site was in danger of being vandalised. Fortunately, when a new President
2080560	2086080	was elected, he stopped the uncontrolled dig and preserved the site for future generations.
2087040	2091840	Now, I have no doubt that there will be comments that this is censorship. Archaeologists are just
2091840	2098480	jealous. They are trying to hush up evidence of a lost civilisation, etc. etc. But imagine
2098480	2104160	the outrage if a gullible Prime Minister of the UK – I'm not pointing fingers, this generic
2104160	2109920	silhouette could be any dim-witted British Prime Minister – believed stories on TV about buried
2109920	2116240	treasure under Stonehenge, and recruited an army of shovel-wielding patriots to go and dig it up.
2117120	2122240	I wonder what the reaction would be. But apart from all the practical effects of
2122240	2127680	spreading these myths, surely there's a matter of principle involved. Do we really want to
2127680	2133680	teach our children history based on fabrications and phony evidence? I mean, it's sometimes
2133680	2139920	wonderful for instilling national pride, but it can also be sinister and destructive. Are we
2139920	2145680	really willing to say it's OK to fabricate evidence and that exposing these fabrications
2145680	2150640	is hateful? Really? Is that the lesson we want our children to learn?
