0	6000	Guess what? The Earth is facing a mini ice age within ten years.
6000	10000	Well, Rush is right about one thing. This is a guess.
10000	13000	I was going to put the next Golden Crocoduck nominee into this slot,
13000	18000	but I find that instead I have to whack another unscientific myth back into its hole,
18000	21000	something that, of course, has gone viral on the Internet.
21000	24000	We're headed for a mini ice age.
24000	27000	Who says so? Well, scientists do.
27000	33000	I have that on good authority, because here's the Daily Mail telling us we face a mini ice age within ten years
33000	40000	because of a drop in sunspot activity, and in the very second line the Daily Mail tells us this claim comes from scientists.
40000	46000	So since we now know this comes from scientists, we don't really need to read the article.
46000	53000	Oh, all right, if you insist. I'll read through it so I can get the names of these scientists for all you sceptics out there.
54000	60000	Frank Hill of the NSO, a scientist, says the solar cycle may be going into some sort of hiatus.
60000	63000	OK, nothing about a mini ice age there.
63000	71000	But Dr Richard Ultrock, also a scientist, says the sun may be going into some sort of state from which it may take a long time to recover.
71000	74000	Oh, OK, still no mini ice age.
74000	79000	Experts not named say the sun has been unusually quiet for about four years.
79000	83000	Well, that's well known, but still nothing about a mini ice age.
83000	89000	And David Hathaway, a scientist from NASA, predicts that this cycle will turn out to be the weakest in a century.
89000	90000	No mini ice age.
90000	97000	Scientist Matt Penn of the NSO says solar magnetic fields which cause sunspots have been decreasing since 1998.
97000	102000	OK, that's in all the scientific literature, but what happened to this mini ice age?
103000	110000	We have four named scientists and a number of unnamed experts all telling us we may be in for an unusual hiatus in sunspot activity,
110000	116000	but not one of them supports the headline that we may be headed for a mini ice age.
116000	121000	The headline is, of course, the conclusion of scientists at the Daily Mail.
121000	126000	Limbo and the Mail weren't the only ones to pull this hypothesis out of thin air.
126000	129000	It's official, wrote James Delingpole in the Daily Telegraph.
129000	131000	A new ice age is on its way.
131000	133000	It's official?
133000	136000	Well, which official body announced it?
136000	138000	No one who was quoted in the article.
138000	142000	Delingpole, the man who's right about everything, apparently,
142000	147000	simply copied and pasted what he read on internet blogs and then embellished it.
147000	153000	Fox News even called this made-up mini ice age the science story of the century.
153000	157000	And away from the mainstream media, the internet blogs were on fire.
157000	161000	Something called the Global Warming Policy Foundation, sounds important,
161000	165000	not only said the Earth may be headed for a mini ice age within the next ten years,
165000	170000	but that that announcement had come from scientists at the US National Solar Observatory.
170000	171000	What?
171000	175000	All right, I've fed these silly media organisations enough rope.
175000	178000	Now let's pull it in and hang them by their balls.
178000	183000	We'll start by wading through all this bullshit and try to find an actual source.
183000	188000	In fact, this media paroxysm all started with a paper at the 2011 Annual Meeting
188000	192000	of the Solar Physics Division of the American Astronomical Society.
192000	197000	Interesting how government researchers are corrupt liars when they say the Earth is warming,
197000	202000	but the model of integrity when they're thought to be suggesting that the Earth is cooling.
202000	207000	Based on the text the media used, their speculation seems to be based on an NSO press release
207000	209000	that accompanied the paper.
209000	212000	Nowhere does it say we're headed for a mini ice age.
212000	217000	The closest any of the media organisations got to admitting that the entire mini ice age story
217000	222000	was based on their own speculation was when Frank Hill, lead author of the paper,
222000	227000	said he wouldn't discuss the effects of a quiet sun on temperature or global warming.
227000	231000	Ooh, conspiracy, keeping secrets, hiding the truth.
231000	235000	No, it's just that he's a solar physicist, not a climatologist.
235000	241000	And neither the mail nor any of the other media organisations bothered to talk to a climate scientist
241000	243000	to see what the repercussions might be.
243000	248000	In fact, all they had to do was spend five minutes searching through the scientific literature
248000	253000	and they would have come across this paper by Fulner and Ramsdorf published last year.
253000	259000	A slowdown of solar activity has been discussed for some time because of the lack of sunspots over the last four years.
259000	265000	Fulner and Ramsdorf calculated that another period of low solar activity, equivalent to the Maunder minimum,
265000	269000	would result in global cooling of no more than 0.3 degrees centigrade.
269000	276000	But that has to be set against the expected rise in temperatures due to a doubling of CO2 from pre-industrial levels,
276000	279000	expected to be between 2.5 and 4 degrees centigrade.
279000	284000	Why didn't any of the media organisations bother to check the scientific literature?
284000	288000	OK, stupid question.
288000	294000	And there's something else that gives away the fact that raging hormones are driving this story rather than brain cells.
294000	299000	These journalists and bloggers seem so convinced that global warming is a scam,
299000	304000	they never even considered that carbon dioxide could overcome this predicted cooling.
304000	307000	Instead, they seem to think that solar cycles drive everything
307000	313000	and spew the most ludicrous nonsense about how this exposed the whole carbon dioxide global warming agenda.
313000	319000	Their fingers have been on the trigger for so long, waiting for evidence to shoot holes in climate science,
319000	324000	that the merest hint of a slowdown in solar activity is enough to make them fire off both barrels.
324000	329000	Scientists try to have it both ways on global warming, was the headline in the blog New American.
329000	334000	But leaving aside that this prediction of a mini ice age comes entirely from the media,
334000	338000	there's only one way scientists have it on long-term climate change,
338000	343000	and that's been repeated ad nauseam in their research papers and on my channel,
343000	349000	that long-term temperature changes are driven by solar irradiance and carbon dioxide levels.
349000	355000	Whether solar activity increases or decreases in the future, it still follows this formula.
355000	362000	Frank Hill obviously got so fed up with all this media speculation that he added a paragraph to the NSO press release
362000	367000	specifically stating that he was not predicting another mini ice age.
367000	375000	And he repeated Fulner and Ramsdorf's estimate of 0.3 degrees for the net cooling effect of a slowdown in solar activity.
375000	382000	Will Hill's statement make a difference to those who are now telling us to expect a mini ice age? Of course not.
382000	386000	Haven't you been paying attention? This is the Science Story of the Century!
