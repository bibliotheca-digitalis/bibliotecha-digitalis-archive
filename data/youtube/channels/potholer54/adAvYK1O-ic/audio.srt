1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,000
Guess what? The Earth is facing a mini ice age within ten years.

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:10,000
Well, Rush is right about one thing. This is a guess.

3
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:13,000
I was going to put the next Golden Crocoduck nominee into this slot,

4
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:18,000
but I find that instead I have to whack another unscientific myth back into its hole,

5
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:21,000
something that, of course, has gone viral on the Internet.

6
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:24,000
We're headed for a mini ice age.

7
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:27,000
Who says so? Well, scientists do.

8
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:33,000
I have that on good authority, because here's the Daily Mail telling us we face a mini ice age within ten years

9
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:40,000
because of a drop in sunspot activity, and in the very second line the Daily Mail tells us this claim comes from scientists.

10
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:46,000
So since we now know this comes from scientists, we don't really need to read the article.

11
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:53,000
Oh, all right, if you insist. I'll read through it so I can get the names of these scientists for all you sceptics out there.

12
00:00:54,000 --> 00:01:00,000
Frank Hill of the NSO, a scientist, says the solar cycle may be going into some sort of hiatus.

13
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:03,000
OK, nothing about a mini ice age there.

14
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:11,000
But Dr Richard Ultrock, also a scientist, says the sun may be going into some sort of state from which it may take a long time to recover.

15
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:14,000
Oh, OK, still no mini ice age.

16
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:19,000
Experts not named say the sun has been unusually quiet for about four years.

17
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:23,000
Well, that's well known, but still nothing about a mini ice age.

18
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:29,000
And David Hathaway, a scientist from NASA, predicts that this cycle will turn out to be the weakest in a century.

19
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:30,000
No mini ice age.

20
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:37,000
Scientist Matt Penn of the NSO says solar magnetic fields which cause sunspots have been decreasing since 1998.

21
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:42,000
OK, that's in all the scientific literature, but what happened to this mini ice age?

22
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:50,000
We have four named scientists and a number of unnamed experts all telling us we may be in for an unusual hiatus in sunspot activity,

23
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:56,000
but not one of them supports the headline that we may be headed for a mini ice age.

24
00:01:56,000 --> 00:02:01,000
The headline is, of course, the conclusion of scientists at the Daily Mail.

25
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:06,000
Limbo and the Mail weren't the only ones to pull this hypothesis out of thin air.

26
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:09,000
It's official, wrote James Delingpole in the Daily Telegraph.

27
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:11,000
A new ice age is on its way.

28
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:13,000
It's official?

29
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:16,000
Well, which official body announced it?

30
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,000
No one who was quoted in the article.

31
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:22,000
Delingpole, the man who's right about everything, apparently,

32
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:27,000
simply copied and pasted what he read on internet blogs and then embellished it.

33
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:33,000
Fox News even called this made-up mini ice age the science story of the century.

34
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:37,000
And away from the mainstream media, the internet blogs were on fire.

35
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:41,000
Something called the Global Warming Policy Foundation, sounds important,

36
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:45,000
not only said the Earth may be headed for a mini ice age within the next ten years,

37
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:50,000
but that that announcement had come from scientists at the US National Solar Observatory.

38
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:51,000
What?

39
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:55,000
All right, I've fed these silly media organisations enough rope.

40
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:58,000
Now let's pull it in and hang them by their balls.

41
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:03,000
We'll start by wading through all this bullshit and try to find an actual source.

42
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:08,000
In fact, this media paroxysm all started with a paper at the 2011 Annual Meeting

43
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:12,000
of the Solar Physics Division of the American Astronomical Society.

44
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:17,000
Interesting how government researchers are corrupt liars when they say the Earth is warming,

45
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:22,000
but the model of integrity when they're thought to be suggesting that the Earth is cooling.

46
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:27,000
Based on the text the media used, their speculation seems to be based on an NSO press release

47
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:29,000
that accompanied the paper.

48
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:32,000
Nowhere does it say we're headed for a mini ice age.

49
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:37,000
The closest any of the media organisations got to admitting that the entire mini ice age story

50
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:42,000
was based on their own speculation was when Frank Hill, lead author of the paper,

51
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:47,000
said he wouldn't discuss the effects of a quiet sun on temperature or global warming.

52
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:51,000
Ooh, conspiracy, keeping secrets, hiding the truth.

53
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:55,000
No, it's just that he's a solar physicist, not a climatologist.

54
00:03:55,000 --> 00:04:01,000
And neither the mail nor any of the other media organisations bothered to talk to a climate scientist

55
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:03,000
to see what the repercussions might be.

56
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:08,000
In fact, all they had to do was spend five minutes searching through the scientific literature

57
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:13,000
and they would have come across this paper by Fulner and Ramsdorf published last year.

58
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:19,000
A slowdown of solar activity has been discussed for some time because of the lack of sunspots over the last four years.

59
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:25,000
Fulner and Ramsdorf calculated that another period of low solar activity, equivalent to the Maunder minimum,

60
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:29,000
would result in global cooling of no more than 0.3 degrees centigrade.

61
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:36,000
But that has to be set against the expected rise in temperatures due to a doubling of CO2 from pre-industrial levels,

62
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:39,000
expected to be between 2.5 and 4 degrees centigrade.

63
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:44,000
Why didn't any of the media organisations bother to check the scientific literature?

64
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:48,000
OK, stupid question.

65
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:54,000
And there's something else that gives away the fact that raging hormones are driving this story rather than brain cells.

66
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:59,000
These journalists and bloggers seem so convinced that global warming is a scam,

67
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:04,000
they never even considered that carbon dioxide could overcome this predicted cooling.

68
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:07,000
Instead, they seem to think that solar cycles drive everything

69
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:13,000
and spew the most ludicrous nonsense about how this exposed the whole carbon dioxide global warming agenda.

70
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:19,000
Their fingers have been on the trigger for so long, waiting for evidence to shoot holes in climate science,

71
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:24,000
that the merest hint of a slowdown in solar activity is enough to make them fire off both barrels.

72
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:29,000
Scientists try to have it both ways on global warming, was the headline in the blog New American.

73
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:34,000
But leaving aside that this prediction of a mini ice age comes entirely from the media,

74
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:38,000
there's only one way scientists have it on long-term climate change,

75
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:43,000
and that's been repeated ad nauseam in their research papers and on my channel,

76
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:49,000
that long-term temperature changes are driven by solar irradiance and carbon dioxide levels.

77
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:55,000
Whether solar activity increases or decreases in the future, it still follows this formula.

78
00:05:55,000 --> 00:06:02,000
Frank Hill obviously got so fed up with all this media speculation that he added a paragraph to the NSO press release

79
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:07,000
specifically stating that he was not predicting another mini ice age.

80
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:15,000
And he repeated Fulner and Ramsdorf's estimate of 0.3 degrees for the net cooling effect of a slowdown in solar activity.

81
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:22,000
Will Hill's statement make a difference to those who are now telling us to expect a mini ice age? Of course not.

82
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:26,000
Haven't you been paying attention? This is the Science Story of the Century!
