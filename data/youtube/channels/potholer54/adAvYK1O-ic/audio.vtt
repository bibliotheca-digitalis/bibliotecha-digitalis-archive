00:00.000 --> 00:06.000
Guess what? The Earth is facing a mini ice age within ten years.

00:06.000 --> 00:10.000
Well, Rush is right about one thing. This is a guess.

00:10.000 --> 00:13.000
I was going to put the next Golden Crocoduck nominee into this slot,

00:13.000 --> 00:18.000
but I find that instead I have to whack another unscientific myth back into its hole,

00:18.000 --> 00:21.000
something that, of course, has gone viral on the Internet.

00:21.000 --> 00:24.000
We're headed for a mini ice age.

00:24.000 --> 00:27.000
Who says so? Well, scientists do.

00:27.000 --> 00:33.000
I have that on good authority, because here's the Daily Mail telling us we face a mini ice age within ten years

00:33.000 --> 00:40.000
because of a drop in sunspot activity, and in the very second line the Daily Mail tells us this claim comes from scientists.

00:40.000 --> 00:46.000
So since we now know this comes from scientists, we don't really need to read the article.

00:46.000 --> 00:53.000
Oh, all right, if you insist. I'll read through it so I can get the names of these scientists for all you sceptics out there.

00:54.000 --> 01:00.000
Frank Hill of the NSO, a scientist, says the solar cycle may be going into some sort of hiatus.

01:00.000 --> 01:03.000
OK, nothing about a mini ice age there.

01:03.000 --> 01:11.000
But Dr Richard Ultrock, also a scientist, says the sun may be going into some sort of state from which it may take a long time to recover.

01:11.000 --> 01:14.000
Oh, OK, still no mini ice age.

01:14.000 --> 01:19.000
Experts not named say the sun has been unusually quiet for about four years.

01:19.000 --> 01:23.000
Well, that's well known, but still nothing about a mini ice age.

01:23.000 --> 01:29.000
And David Hathaway, a scientist from NASA, predicts that this cycle will turn out to be the weakest in a century.

01:29.000 --> 01:30.000
No mini ice age.

01:30.000 --> 01:37.000
Scientist Matt Penn of the NSO says solar magnetic fields which cause sunspots have been decreasing since 1998.

01:37.000 --> 01:42.000
OK, that's in all the scientific literature, but what happened to this mini ice age?

01:43.000 --> 01:50.000
We have four named scientists and a number of unnamed experts all telling us we may be in for an unusual hiatus in sunspot activity,

01:50.000 --> 01:56.000
but not one of them supports the headline that we may be headed for a mini ice age.

01:56.000 --> 02:01.000
The headline is, of course, the conclusion of scientists at the Daily Mail.

02:01.000 --> 02:06.000
Limbo and the Mail weren't the only ones to pull this hypothesis out of thin air.

02:06.000 --> 02:09.000
It's official, wrote James Delingpole in the Daily Telegraph.

02:09.000 --> 02:11.000
A new ice age is on its way.

02:11.000 --> 02:13.000
It's official?

02:13.000 --> 02:16.000
Well, which official body announced it?

02:16.000 --> 02:18.000
No one who was quoted in the article.

02:18.000 --> 02:22.000
Delingpole, the man who's right about everything, apparently,

02:22.000 --> 02:27.000
simply copied and pasted what he read on internet blogs and then embellished it.

02:27.000 --> 02:33.000
Fox News even called this made-up mini ice age the science story of the century.

02:33.000 --> 02:37.000
And away from the mainstream media, the internet blogs were on fire.

02:37.000 --> 02:41.000
Something called the Global Warming Policy Foundation, sounds important,

02:41.000 --> 02:45.000
not only said the Earth may be headed for a mini ice age within the next ten years,

02:45.000 --> 02:50.000
but that that announcement had come from scientists at the US National Solar Observatory.

02:50.000 --> 02:51.000
What?

02:51.000 --> 02:55.000
All right, I've fed these silly media organisations enough rope.

02:55.000 --> 02:58.000
Now let's pull it in and hang them by their balls.

02:58.000 --> 03:03.000
We'll start by wading through all this bullshit and try to find an actual source.

03:03.000 --> 03:08.000
In fact, this media paroxysm all started with a paper at the 2011 Annual Meeting

03:08.000 --> 03:12.000
of the Solar Physics Division of the American Astronomical Society.

03:12.000 --> 03:17.000
Interesting how government researchers are corrupt liars when they say the Earth is warming,

03:17.000 --> 03:22.000
but the model of integrity when they're thought to be suggesting that the Earth is cooling.

03:22.000 --> 03:27.000
Based on the text the media used, their speculation seems to be based on an NSO press release

03:27.000 --> 03:29.000
that accompanied the paper.

03:29.000 --> 03:32.000
Nowhere does it say we're headed for a mini ice age.

03:32.000 --> 03:37.000
The closest any of the media organisations got to admitting that the entire mini ice age story

03:37.000 --> 03:42.000
was based on their own speculation was when Frank Hill, lead author of the paper,

03:42.000 --> 03:47.000
said he wouldn't discuss the effects of a quiet sun on temperature or global warming.

03:47.000 --> 03:51.000
Ooh, conspiracy, keeping secrets, hiding the truth.

03:51.000 --> 03:55.000
No, it's just that he's a solar physicist, not a climatologist.

03:55.000 --> 04:01.000
And neither the mail nor any of the other media organisations bothered to talk to a climate scientist

04:01.000 --> 04:03.000
to see what the repercussions might be.

04:03.000 --> 04:08.000
In fact, all they had to do was spend five minutes searching through the scientific literature

04:08.000 --> 04:13.000
and they would have come across this paper by Fulner and Ramsdorf published last year.

04:13.000 --> 04:19.000
A slowdown of solar activity has been discussed for some time because of the lack of sunspots over the last four years.

04:19.000 --> 04:25.000
Fulner and Ramsdorf calculated that another period of low solar activity, equivalent to the Maunder minimum,

04:25.000 --> 04:29.000
would result in global cooling of no more than 0.3 degrees centigrade.

04:29.000 --> 04:36.000
But that has to be set against the expected rise in temperatures due to a doubling of CO2 from pre-industrial levels,

04:36.000 --> 04:39.000
expected to be between 2.5 and 4 degrees centigrade.

04:39.000 --> 04:44.000
Why didn't any of the media organisations bother to check the scientific literature?

04:44.000 --> 04:48.000
OK, stupid question.

04:48.000 --> 04:54.000
And there's something else that gives away the fact that raging hormones are driving this story rather than brain cells.

04:54.000 --> 04:59.000
These journalists and bloggers seem so convinced that global warming is a scam,

04:59.000 --> 05:04.000
they never even considered that carbon dioxide could overcome this predicted cooling.

05:04.000 --> 05:07.000
Instead, they seem to think that solar cycles drive everything

05:07.000 --> 05:13.000
and spew the most ludicrous nonsense about how this exposed the whole carbon dioxide global warming agenda.

05:13.000 --> 05:19.000
Their fingers have been on the trigger for so long, waiting for evidence to shoot holes in climate science,

05:19.000 --> 05:24.000
that the merest hint of a slowdown in solar activity is enough to make them fire off both barrels.

05:24.000 --> 05:29.000
Scientists try to have it both ways on global warming, was the headline in the blog New American.

05:29.000 --> 05:34.000
But leaving aside that this prediction of a mini ice age comes entirely from the media,

05:34.000 --> 05:38.000
there's only one way scientists have it on long-term climate change,

05:38.000 --> 05:43.000
and that's been repeated ad nauseam in their research papers and on my channel,

05:43.000 --> 05:49.000
that long-term temperature changes are driven by solar irradiance and carbon dioxide levels.

05:49.000 --> 05:55.000
Whether solar activity increases or decreases in the future, it still follows this formula.

05:55.000 --> 06:02.000
Frank Hill obviously got so fed up with all this media speculation that he added a paragraph to the NSO press release

06:02.000 --> 06:07.000
specifically stating that he was not predicting another mini ice age.

06:07.000 --> 06:15.000
And he repeated Fulner and Ramsdorf's estimate of 0.3 degrees for the net cooling effect of a slowdown in solar activity.

06:15.000 --> 06:22.000
Will Hill's statement make a difference to those who are now telling us to expect a mini ice age? Of course not.

06:22.000 --> 06:26.000
Haven't you been paying attention? This is the Science Story of the Century!
