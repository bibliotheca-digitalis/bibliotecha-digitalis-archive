0	4120	This is just a quick video regarding a couple of things related to my channel.
4120	9600	Firstly, my apologies to those who have had trouble posting. My settings are for
9600	14280	everything to go onto the forum without pre-approval, but YouTube keeps sending
14280	18680	dozens of posts every week into the spam directory. Every day I have to go in
18680	23480	there and mass approve everything, but if I miss a few days then they pile up and
23480	28560	for some reason I can't see them at all. When I click show more this is what I
28560	33320	get. That's why there are now over a thousand posts in the spam directory
33320	38320	that I can't even read, let alone send to the forum. If anyone has a solution to
38320	43260	this, please let me know. In the meantime, my apologies if you're among the 1,000
43260	47920	odd people whose messages didn't appear. If when you post a message you don't see
47920	52400	it come up on the forum straight away, please try again. I have no idea why
52400	58320	YouTube decides its spam. Second thing, a lot of people have asked me if I can set
58320	62680	up a Patreon account because they want to support me. Well, thanks to all those
62680	67200	who've offered. I do appreciate your support, but I do this as a hobby and
67200	71320	really don't need the money. I'd only go and spend it on something vain and
71320	76120	frivolous like gold plating my seat belts, but I thought it's a bit of a
76120	81360	waste to reject such generosity, so here's what we'll do. I recently went to
81360	85280	Borneo and did a story on a very innovative project that trades community
85280	89160	health care in exchange for a pledge not to cut down timber from the
89160	93620	neighbouring National Park. In the past, these communities used to illegally log
93620	98760	the forest whenever they needed cash, mostly to pay medical bills. So a group
98760	103340	of doctors and dentists set up a clinic and offered a 70% discount on medical
103340	107920	care if the villagers promised not to cut down the surrounding forest. The
107920	112840	remaining 30% of the medical fees can be paid in seedlings that are helping
112840	117720	regenerate the degraded areas. The scheme works so well that illegal logging
117720	122740	rates are way down and the health of the communities is way up. The idea is now
122740	127000	being expanded into other places. It's one of the most innovative projects I've
127000	131640	ever seen, a kind of win-win, and I was with the doctors when they saved the
131640	137080	life of an 11 year old girl, so I know it works. If you want to know more, there are
137080	142560	a few links in the video description. So rather than send the money to me, please
142600	147240	send the money to this organisation. Your contribution will be tax-deductible and
147240	151800	details are in the video description. Just send whatever you would have sent
151800	156240	to an imaginary Patreon account for my channel and send me a message whenever
156240	160760	you make a contribution. I'll have far more incentive to make these videos if I
160760	164200	know the money is going to something worthwhile rather than just fattening my
164200	166840	bank account.
