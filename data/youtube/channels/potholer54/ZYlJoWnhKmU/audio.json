{"text": " This is just a quick video regarding a couple of things related to my channel. Firstly, my apologies to those who have had trouble posting. My settings are for everything to go onto the forum without pre-approval, but YouTube keeps sending dozens of posts every week into the spam directory. Every day I have to go in there and mass approve everything, but if I miss a few days then they pile up and for some reason I can't see them at all. When I click show more this is what I get. That's why there are now over a thousand posts in the spam directory that I can't even read, let alone send to the forum. If anyone has a solution to this, please let me know. In the meantime, my apologies if you're among the 1,000 odd people whose messages didn't appear. If when you post a message you don't see it come up on the forum straight away, please try again. I have no idea why YouTube decides its spam. Second thing, a lot of people have asked me if I can set up a Patreon account because they want to support me. Well, thanks to all those who've offered. I do appreciate your support, but I do this as a hobby and really don't need the money. I'd only go and spend it on something vain and frivolous like gold plating my seat belts, but I thought it's a bit of a waste to reject such generosity, so here's what we'll do. I recently went to Borneo and did a story on a very innovative project that trades community health care in exchange for a pledge not to cut down timber from the neighbouring National Park. In the past, these communities used to illegally log the forest whenever they needed cash, mostly to pay medical bills. So a group of doctors and dentists set up a clinic and offered a 70% discount on medical care if the villagers promised not to cut down the surrounding forest. The remaining 30% of the medical fees can be paid in seedlings that are helping regenerate the degraded areas. The scheme works so well that illegal logging rates are way down and the health of the communities is way up. The idea is now being expanded into other places. It's one of the most innovative projects I've ever seen, a kind of win-win, and I was with the doctors when they saved the life of an 11 year old girl, so I know it works. If you want to know more, there are a few links in the video description. So rather than send the money to me, please send the money to this organisation. Your contribution will be tax-deductible and details are in the video description. Just send whatever you would have sent to an imaginary Patreon account for my channel and send me a message whenever you make a contribution. I'll have far more incentive to make these videos if I know the money is going to something worthwhile rather than just fattening my bank account.", "segments": [{"id": 0, "seek": 0, "start": 0.0, "end": 4.12, "text": " This is just a quick video regarding a couple of things related to my channel.", "tokens": [50363, 770, 318, 655, 257, 2068, 2008, 5115, 257, 3155, 286, 1243, 3519, 284, 616, 6518, 13, 50569], "temperature": 0.0, "avg_logprob": -0.12237323043692826, "compression_ratio": 1.6369863013698631, "no_speech_prob": 0.10913996398448944}, {"id": 1, "seek": 0, "start": 4.12, "end": 9.6, "text": " Firstly, my apologies to those who have had trouble posting.
