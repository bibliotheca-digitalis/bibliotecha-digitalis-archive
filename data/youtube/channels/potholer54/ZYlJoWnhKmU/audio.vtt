This is just a quick video regarding a couple of things related to my channel.

00:04.120 --> 00:09.600
Firstly, my apologies to those who have had trouble posting. My settings are for

00:09.600 --> 00:14.280
everything to go onto the forum without pre-approval, but YouTube keeps sending

00:14.280 --> 00:18.680
dozens of posts every week into the spam directory. Every day I have to go in

00:18.680 --> 00:23.480
there and mass approve everything, but if I miss a few days then they pile up and

00:23.480 --> 00:28.560
for some reason I can't see them at all. When I click show more this is what I

00:28.560 --> 00:33.320
get. That's why there are now over a thousand posts in the spam directory

00:33.320 --> 00:38.320
that I can't even read, let alone send to the forum. If anyone has a solution to

00:38.320 --> 00:43.260
this, please let me know. In the meantime, my apologies if you're among the 1,000

00:43.260 --> 00:47.920
odd people whose messages didn't appear. If when you post a message you don't see

00:47.920 --> 00:52.400
it come up on the forum straight away, please try again. I have no idea why

00:52.400 --> 00:58.320
YouTube decides its spam. Second thing, a lot of people have asked me if I can set

00:58.320 --> 01:02.680
up a Patreon account because they want to support me. Well, thanks to all those

01:02.680 --> 01:07.200
who've offered. I do appreciate your support, but I do this as a hobby and

01:07.200 --> 01:11.320
really don't need the money. I'd only go and spend it on something vain and

01:11.320 --> 01:16.120
frivolous like gold plating my seat belts, but I thought it's a bit of a

01:16.120 --> 01:21.360
waste to reject such generosity, so here's what we'll do. I recently went to

01:21.360 --> 01:25.280
Borneo and did a story on a very innovative project that trades community

01:25.280 --> 01:29.160
health care in exchange for a pledge not to cut down timber from the

01:29.160 --> 01:33.620
neighbouring National Park. In the past, these communities used to illegally log

01:33.620 --> 01:38.760
the forest whenever they needed cash, mostly to pay medical bills. So a group

01:38.760 --> 01:43.340
of doctors and dentists set up a clinic and offered a 70% discount on medical

01:43.340 --> 01:47.920
care if the villagers promised not to cut down the surrounding forest. The

01:47.920 --> 01:52.840
remaining 30% of the medical fees can be paid in seedlings that are helping

01:52.840 --> 01:57.720
regenerate the degraded areas. The scheme works so well that illegal logging

01:57.720 --> 02:02.740
rates are way down and the health of the communities is way up. The idea is now

02:02.740 --> 02:07.000
being expanded into other places. It's one of the most innovative projects I've

02:07.000 --> 02:11.640
ever seen, a kind of win-win, and I was with the doctors when they saved the

02:11.640 --> 02:17.080
life of an 11 year old girl, so I know it works. If you want to know more, there are

02:17.080 --> 02:22.560
a few links in the video description. So rather than send the money to me, please

02:22.600 --> 02:27.240
send the money to this organisation. Your contribution will be tax-deductible and

02:27.240 --> 02:31.800
details are in the video description. Just send whatever you would have sent

02:31.800 --> 02:36.240
to an imaginary Patreon account for my channel and send me a message whenever

02:36.240 --> 02:40.760
you make a contribution. I'll have far more incentive to make these videos if I

02:40.760 --> 02:44.200
know the money is going to something worthwhile rather than just fattening my

02:44.200 --> 02:46.840
bank account.
