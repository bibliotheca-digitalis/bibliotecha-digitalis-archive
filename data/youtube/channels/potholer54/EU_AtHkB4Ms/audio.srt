1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,000
Now we're going to pay for it. Scientists are telling us we're heading into a new ice age?

2
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:18,000
What? It's from Time magazine. Monday, June 24th, 1974.

3
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:24,000
Yes, to quote the title of Penn & Teller's TV series, this video and the next will look at bullshit.

4
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:29,000
Or, to put it more politely, urban myths that have grown up around the subject of climate change.

5
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:36,000
In the first two videos I looked at the science of climate change and real research done by experts on both sides of the issue.

6
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:39,000
Now it's the turn of the amateurs.

7
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:44,000
Now I love Penn & Teller and I appreciate that bullshit is supposed to be entertainment.

8
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:48,000
But this claim also pops up in internet blogs and even mainstream media.

9
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:53,000
This is Time magazine in 1975. Another ice age is coming. We're all going to die.

10
00:00:53,000 --> 00:01:00,000
And this is Senator James Inhofe, who not only cites Time but also this 1975 story in Newsweek.

11
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:04,000
George Will cites a 1975 article in the New York Times.

12
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:10,000
And Michael Crichton makes the claim on page 315 of his book, State of Fear.

13
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:16,000
In the 1970s he writes, all the climate scientists believed an ice age was coming.

14
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:21,000
But these are all popular newspapers, magazines and novels, not scientific journals.

15
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:23,000
It's from Time magazine.

16
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:26,000
So what Penn? Time magazine isn't peer reviewed.

17
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:31,000
It's just as capable of misreporting and sensationalising stories as any other magazine.

18
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:38,000
Don't just take my word for it. Read the story and tell me exactly where this claim about an ice age comes from.

19
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:42,000
Five people, all scientists, were named in the story.

20
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:47,000
They all agreed that the Earth had been cooling. Sure, that was evident from the temperature data.

21
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:51,000
But not one of them substantiated Time's line of an impending ice age.

22
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:55,000
And one of them even said the period of cooling was about to end.

23
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:59,000
So where did Time get the idea an ice age was coming?

24
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:06,000
Well, the magazine had to resort to an old journalist's trick of inventing a pack of unnamed and unquoted sources.

25
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:11,000
Climatological casandras are becoming increasingly apprehensive. That may be.

26
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:15,000
But why couldn't Time magazine find one of these climatological casandras?

27
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:20,000
Perhaps because they weren't as numerous as the headline and the hype suggest.

28
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:27,000
The question is how many climatologists in the 1970s did accept this conclusion of a coming ice age?

29
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:31,000
If you want to find out, it's no good thumbing through Time and Newsweek.

30
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:35,000
Boring as it sounds, you have to look at the scientific literature.

31
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:43,000
The first thing you notice is an admission from a lot of scientific bodies that there was great uncertainty about the climate in the 1970s.

32
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:46,000
Okay, but was there any kind of consensus?

33
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:51,000
Well, if all or most climate scientists were predicting another ice age back in the 1970s,

34
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:56,000
there should be lots of scientific papers from that time supporting that conclusion.

35
00:02:56,000 --> 00:03:01,000
After all, there are hundreds of scientific papers today supporting anthropogenic climate change.

36
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:09,000
A review published in the Bulletin of the American Meteorological Society looked at the scientific literature rather than the popular press.

37
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:16,000
Three climatologists searched scientific journals between 1965 and 1979.

38
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:22,000
And yes, they found seven papers predicting not an ice age but global cooling.

39
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:28,000
The only problem is they also found 44 articles predicting global warming.

40
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:33,000
Even though the world was cooling in the 1970s and had been for three decades,

41
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:41,000
even so, six times as many climatologists predicted that the danger was global warming, not global cooling.

42
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:46,000
The reason is simple. By that time, the mechanism of global warming was understood,

43
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:50,000
the probable trigger for ice ages was beginning to be understood,

44
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:54,000
and the reason for global cooling was reasonably well understood.

45
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:59,000
Climatologists suspected, and we now know, that it was caused by pollution,

46
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:03,000
mostly particulates and aerosols, which blocked sunlight.

47
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:10,000
Even with all the uncertainty, the majority of climatologists concluded that global warming caused by carbon dioxide

48
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:14,000
would eventually overwhelm any global cooling caused by pollution.

49
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:20,000
But if that's the case, why were all the media saying scientists predicted global cooling?

50
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:27,000
Simple. They weren't. There were plenty of news stories in the 1970s reporting other conclusions.

51
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:31,000
It's just that people like George Will chose not to mention the fact.

52
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:35,000
It's not as if Will was unaware of the existence of these newspaper reports.

53
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:40,000
How do I know? Well, remember that 1975 New York Times story?

54
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:47,000
According to a George Will column last year, it reported many signs that Earth may be heading for another ice age.

55
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:53,000
I tracked down the story and was astonished to find it was called Warming Trends Seen in Climate.

56
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:58,000
Could this be the same article that, according to Will, says we're headed for another ice age?

57
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:04,000
I checked the whole article. The quote about an ice age wasn't even there. At all.

58
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:07,000
Here's the story. See if you can find it.

59
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:11,000
OK, maybe I made a mistake in attributing the quote to George Will.

60
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:17,000
So I googled his name and the phrase, Earth may be heading for another ice age, and found not one,

61
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:21,000
but three columns in which Will makes exactly the same claim.

62
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:29,000
He first made the claim in 1992, then in 2004, and again last year.

63
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:38,000
And remember Senator Inhofe? Well, he had at least one quote that came from a respected scientific body rather than the popular media.

64
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:44,000
It was a 1974 report from the National Science Board, and here's the quote Inhofe used from that report,

65
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:48,000
exactly as it was written in his statement to the Senate.

66
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:54,000
Judging from the record of the past interglacial ages, the present time of high temperatures should be drawing to an end,

67
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:59,000
leading into the next glacial age, period.

68
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:06,000
But in the original report, the period came later. Inhofe left out some crucial words at the end of that sentence.

69
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:12,000
Leading into the next glacial age, 20,000 years from now.

70
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:19,000
20,000 years is close to the 16,000 years that's the current estimate for the onset of the next ice age.

71
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:27,000
But for the purposes of propagating an urban myth, the claim about a consensus on an imminent ice age simply does the rounds unchecked,

72
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:29,000
even when it's dressed up as science.

73
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:34,000
Welcome to Headline Earth, the show that brings global warming back down to the basics, the science.

74
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:40,000
Back in the 70s, there was this trend or this scare about global cooling.

75
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:45,000
The bottom line is there was no scientific consensus about the climate in the 1970s.

76
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:50,000
There was a sudden realization that the climate was changing, but there was a lack of good data,

77
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:56,000
a lack of technology, a lack of evidence, and admitted uncertainty about what was happening.

78
00:06:56,000 --> 00:07:01,000
Of course, it's important to show that climatologists have got this global warming thing wrong,

79
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:06,000
and a great way to show this is to say that they predicted global cooling in the 1970s.

80
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:10,000
Yes, I get it, but don't dress this up as science.

81
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:14,000
If geologists found evidence that an earthquake is going to hit California,

82
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:17,000
or a tsunami is about to devastate the coast of Japan,

83
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:24,000
what kind of individual would want to deliberately manufacture misleading information to discredit them?
