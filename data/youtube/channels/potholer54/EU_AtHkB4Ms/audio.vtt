00:00.000 --> 00:08.000
Now we're going to pay for it. Scientists are telling us we're heading into a new ice age?

00:08.000 --> 00:18.000
What? It's from Time magazine. Monday, June 24th, 1974.

00:18.000 --> 00:24.000
Yes, to quote the title of Penn & Teller's TV series, this video and the next will look at bullshit.

00:24.000 --> 00:29.000
Or, to put it more politely, urban myths that have grown up around the subject of climate change.

00:29.000 --> 00:36.000
In the first two videos I looked at the science of climate change and real research done by experts on both sides of the issue.

00:36.000 --> 00:39.000
Now it's the turn of the amateurs.

00:39.000 --> 00:44.000
Now I love Penn & Teller and I appreciate that bullshit is supposed to be entertainment.

00:44.000 --> 00:48.000
But this claim also pops up in internet blogs and even mainstream media.

00:48.000 --> 00:53.000
This is Time magazine in 1975. Another ice age is coming. We're all going to die.

00:53.000 --> 01:00.000
And this is Senator James Inhofe, who not only cites Time but also this 1975 story in Newsweek.

01:00.000 --> 01:04.000
George Will cites a 1975 article in the New York Times.

01:04.000 --> 01:10.000
And Michael Crichton makes the claim on page 315 of his book, State of Fear.

01:10.000 --> 01:16.000
In the 1970s he writes, all the climate scientists believed an ice age was coming.

01:16.000 --> 01:21.000
But these are all popular newspapers, magazines and novels, not scientific journals.

01:21.000 --> 01:23.000
It's from Time magazine.

01:23.000 --> 01:26.000
So what Penn? Time magazine isn't peer reviewed.

01:26.000 --> 01:31.000
It's just as capable of misreporting and sensationalising stories as any other magazine.

01:31.000 --> 01:38.000
Don't just take my word for it. Read the story and tell me exactly where this claim about an ice age comes from.

01:38.000 --> 01:42.000
Five people, all scientists, were named in the story.

01:42.000 --> 01:47.000
They all agreed that the Earth had been cooling. Sure, that was evident from the temperature data.

01:47.000 --> 01:51.000
But not one of them substantiated Time's line of an impending ice age.

01:51.000 --> 01:55.000
And one of them even said the period of cooling was about to end.

01:55.000 --> 01:59.000
So where did Time get the idea an ice age was coming?

01:59.000 --> 02:06.000
Well, the magazine had to resort to an old journalist's trick of inventing a pack of unnamed and unquoted sources.

02:06.000 --> 02:11.000
Climatological casandras are becoming increasingly apprehensive. That may be.

02:11.000 --> 02:15.000
But why couldn't Time magazine find one of these climatological casandras?

02:15.000 --> 02:20.000
Perhaps because they weren't as numerous as the headline and the hype suggest.

02:20.000 --> 02:27.000
The question is how many climatologists in the 1970s did accept this conclusion of a coming ice age?

02:27.000 --> 02:31.000
If you want to find out, it's no good thumbing through Time and Newsweek.

02:31.000 --> 02:35.000
Boring as it sounds, you have to look at the scientific literature.

02:35.000 --> 02:43.000
The first thing you notice is an admission from a lot of scientific bodies that there was great uncertainty about the climate in the 1970s.

02:43.000 --> 02:46.000
Okay, but was there any kind of consensus?

02:46.000 --> 02:51.000
Well, if all or most climate scientists were predicting another ice age back in the 1970s,

02:51.000 --> 02:56.000
there should be lots of scientific papers from that time supporting that conclusion.

02:56.000 --> 03:01.000
After all, there are hundreds of scientific papers today supporting anthropogenic climate change.

03:01.000 --> 03:09.000
A review published in the Bulletin of the American Meteorological Society looked at the scientific literature rather than the popular press.

03:10.000 --> 03:16.000
Three climatologists searched scientific journals between 1965 and 1979.

03:16.000 --> 03:22.000
And yes, they found seven papers predicting not an ice age but global cooling.

03:22.000 --> 03:28.000
The only problem is they also found 44 articles predicting global warming.

03:28.000 --> 03:33.000
Even though the world was cooling in the 1970s and had been for three decades,

03:33.000 --> 03:41.000
even so, six times as many climatologists predicted that the danger was global warming, not global cooling.

03:41.000 --> 03:46.000
The reason is simple. By that time, the mechanism of global warming was understood,

03:46.000 --> 03:50.000
the probable trigger for ice ages was beginning to be understood,

03:50.000 --> 03:54.000
and the reason for global cooling was reasonably well understood.

03:54.000 --> 03:59.000
Climatologists suspected, and we now know, that it was caused by pollution,

03:59.000 --> 04:03.000
mostly particulates and aerosols, which blocked sunlight.

04:03.000 --> 04:10.000
Even with all the uncertainty, the majority of climatologists concluded that global warming caused by carbon dioxide

04:10.000 --> 04:14.000
would eventually overwhelm any global cooling caused by pollution.

04:14.000 --> 04:20.000
But if that's the case, why were all the media saying scientists predicted global cooling?

04:20.000 --> 04:27.000
Simple. They weren't. There were plenty of news stories in the 1970s reporting other conclusions.

04:27.000 --> 04:31.000
It's just that people like George Will chose not to mention the fact.

04:31.000 --> 04:35.000
It's not as if Will was unaware of the existence of these newspaper reports.

04:35.000 --> 04:40.000
How do I know? Well, remember that 1975 New York Times story?

04:40.000 --> 04:47.000
According to a George Will column last year, it reported many signs that Earth may be heading for another ice age.

04:48.000 --> 04:53.000
I tracked down the story and was astonished to find it was called Warming Trends Seen in Climate.

04:53.000 --> 04:58.000
Could this be the same article that, according to Will, says we're headed for another ice age?

04:58.000 --> 05:04.000
I checked the whole article. The quote about an ice age wasn't even there. At all.

05:04.000 --> 05:07.000
Here's the story. See if you can find it.

05:07.000 --> 05:11.000
OK, maybe I made a mistake in attributing the quote to George Will.

05:11.000 --> 05:17.000
So I googled his name and the phrase, Earth may be heading for another ice age, and found not one,

05:17.000 --> 05:21.000
but three columns in which Will makes exactly the same claim.

05:21.000 --> 05:29.000
He first made the claim in 1992, then in 2004, and again last year.

05:29.000 --> 05:38.000
And remember Senator Inhofe? Well, he had at least one quote that came from a respected scientific body rather than the popular media.

05:38.000 --> 05:44.000
It was a 1974 report from the National Science Board, and here's the quote Inhofe used from that report,

05:44.000 --> 05:48.000
exactly as it was written in his statement to the Senate.

05:48.000 --> 05:54.000
Judging from the record of the past interglacial ages, the present time of high temperatures should be drawing to an end,

05:54.000 --> 05:59.000
leading into the next glacial age, period.

05:59.000 --> 06:06.000
But in the original report, the period came later. Inhofe left out some crucial words at the end of that sentence.

06:06.000 --> 06:12.000
Leading into the next glacial age, 20,000 years from now.

06:12.000 --> 06:19.000
20,000 years is close to the 16,000 years that's the current estimate for the onset of the next ice age.

06:19.000 --> 06:27.000
But for the purposes of propagating an urban myth, the claim about a consensus on an imminent ice age simply does the rounds unchecked,

06:27.000 --> 06:29.000
even when it's dressed up as science.

06:29.000 --> 06:34.000
Welcome to Headline Earth, the show that brings global warming back down to the basics, the science.

06:34.000 --> 06:40.000
Back in the 70s, there was this trend or this scare about global cooling.

06:40.000 --> 06:45.000
The bottom line is there was no scientific consensus about the climate in the 1970s.

06:45.000 --> 06:50.000
There was a sudden realization that the climate was changing, but there was a lack of good data,

06:50.000 --> 06:56.000
a lack of technology, a lack of evidence, and admitted uncertainty about what was happening.

06:56.000 --> 07:01.000
Of course, it's important to show that climatologists have got this global warming thing wrong,

07:01.000 --> 07:06.000
and a great way to show this is to say that they predicted global cooling in the 1970s.

07:06.000 --> 07:10.000
Yes, I get it, but don't dress this up as science.

07:10.000 --> 07:14.000
If geologists found evidence that an earthquake is going to hit California,

07:14.000 --> 07:17.000
or a tsunami is about to devastate the coast of Japan,

07:17.000 --> 07:24.000
what kind of individual would want to deliberately manufacture misleading information to discredit them?
