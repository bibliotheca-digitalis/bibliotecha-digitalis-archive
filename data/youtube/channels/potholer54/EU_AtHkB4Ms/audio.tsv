0	8000	Now we're going to pay for it. Scientists are telling us we're heading into a new ice age?
8000	18000	What? It's from Time magazine. Monday, June 24th, 1974.
18000	24000	Yes, to quote the title of Penn & Teller's TV series, this video and the next will look at bullshit.
24000	29000	Or, to put it more politely, urban myths that have grown up around the subject of climate change.
29000	36000	In the first two videos I looked at the science of climate change and real research done by experts on both sides of the issue.
36000	39000	Now it's the turn of the amateurs.
39000	44000	Now I love Penn & Teller and I appreciate that bullshit is supposed to be entertainment.
44000	48000	But this claim also pops up in internet blogs and even mainstream media.
48000	53000	This is Time magazine in 1975. Another ice age is coming. We're all going to die.
53000	60000	And this is Senator James Inhofe, who not only cites Time but also this 1975 story in Newsweek.
60000	64000	George Will cites a 1975 article in the New York Times.
64000	70000	And Michael Crichton makes the claim on page 315 of his book, State of Fear.
70000	76000	In the 1970s he writes, all the climate scientists believed an ice age was coming.
76000	81000	But these are all popular newspapers, magazines and novels, not scientific journals.
81000	83000	It's from Time magazine.
83000	86000	So what Penn? Time magazine isn't peer reviewed.
86000	91000	It's just as capable of misreporting and sensationalising stories as any other magazine.
91000	98000	Don't just take my word for it. Read the story and tell me exactly where this claim about an ice age comes from.
98000	102000	Five people, all scientists, were named in the story.
102000	107000	They all agreed that the Earth had been cooling. Sure, that was evident from the temperature data.
107000	111000	But not one of them substantiated Time's line of an impending ice age.
111000	115000	And one of them even said the period of cooling was about to end.
115000	119000	So where did Time get the idea an ice age was coming?
119000	126000	Well, the magazine had to resort to an old journalist's trick of inventing a pack of unnamed and unquoted sources.
126000	131000	Climatological casandras are becoming increasingly apprehensive. That may be.
131000	135000	But why couldn't Time magazine find one of these climatological casandras?
135000	140000	Perhaps because they weren't as numerous as the headline and the hype suggest.
140000	147000	The question is how many climatologists in the 1970s did accept this conclusion of a coming ice age?
147000	151000	If you want to find out, it's no good thumbing through Time and Newsweek.
151000	155000	Boring as it sounds, you have to look at the scientific literature.
155000	163000	The first thing you notice is an admission from a lot of scientific bodies that there was great uncertainty about the climate in the 1970s.
163000	166000	Okay, but was there any kind of consensus?
166000	171000	Well, if all or most climate scientists were predicting another ice age back in the 1970s,
171000	176000	there should be lots of scientific papers from that time supporting that conclusion.
176000	181000	After all, there are hundreds of scientific papers today supporting anthropogenic climate change.
181000	189000	A review published in the Bulletin of the American Meteorological Society looked at the scientific literature rather than the popular press.
190000	196000	Three climatologists searched scientific journals between 1965 and 1979.
196000	202000	And yes, they found seven papers predicting not an ice age but global cooling.
202000	208000	The only problem is they also found 44 articles predicting global warming.
208000	213000	Even though the world was cooling in the 1970s and had been for three decades,
213000	221000	even so, six times as many climatologists predicted that the danger was global warming, not global cooling.
221000	226000	The reason is simple. By that time, the mechanism of global warming was understood,
226000	230000	the probable trigger for ice ages was beginning to be understood,
230000	234000	and the reason for global cooling was reasonably well understood.
234000	239000	Climatologists suspected, and we now know, that it was caused by pollution,
239000	243000	mostly particulates and aerosols, which blocked sunlight.
243000	250000	Even with all the uncertainty, the majority of climatologists concluded that global warming caused by carbon dioxide
250000	254000	would eventually overwhelm any global cooling caused by pollution.
254000	260000	But if that's the case, why were all the media saying scientists predicted global cooling?
260000	267000	Simple. They weren't. There were plenty of news stories in the 1970s reporting other conclusions.
267000	271000	It's just that people like George Will chose not to mention the fact.
271000	275000	It's not as if Will was unaware of the existence of these newspaper reports.
275000	280000	How do I know? Well, remember that 1975 New York Times story?
280000	287000	According to a George Will column last year, it reported many signs that Earth may be heading for another ice age.
288000	293000	I tracked down the story and was astonished to find it was called Warming Trends Seen in Climate.
293000	298000	Could this be the same article that, according to Will, says we're headed for another ice age?
298000	304000	I checked the whole article. The quote about an ice age wasn't even there. At all.
304000	307000	Here's the story. See if you can find it.
307000	311000	OK, maybe I made a mistake in attributing the quote to George Will.
311000	317000	So I googled his name and the phrase, Earth may be heading for another ice age, and found not one,
317000	321000	but three columns in which Will makes exactly the same claim.
321000	329000	He first made the claim in 1992, then in 2004, and again last year.
329000	338000	And remember Senator Inhofe? Well, he had at least one quote that came from a respected scientific body rather than the popular media.
338000	344000	It was a 1974 report from the National Science Board, and here's the quote Inhofe used from that report,
344000	348000	exactly as it was written in his statement to the Senate.
348000	354000	Judging from the record of the past interglacial ages, the present time of high temperatures should be drawing to an end,
354000	359000	leading into the next glacial age, period.
359000	366000	But in the original report, the period came later. Inhofe left out some crucial words at the end of that sentence.
366000	372000	Leading into the next glacial age, 20,000 years from now.
372000	379000	20,000 years is close to the 16,000 years that's the current estimate for the onset of the next ice age.
379000	387000	But for the purposes of propagating an urban myth, the claim about a consensus on an imminent ice age simply does the rounds unchecked,
387000	389000	even when it's dressed up as science.
389000	394000	Welcome to Headline Earth, the show that brings global warming back down to the basics, the science.
394000	400000	Back in the 70s, there was this trend or this scare about global cooling.
400000	405000	The bottom line is there was no scientific consensus about the climate in the 1970s.
405000	410000	There was a sudden realization that the climate was changing, but there was a lack of good data,
410000	416000	a lack of technology, a lack of evidence, and admitted uncertainty about what was happening.
416000	421000	Of course, it's important to show that climatologists have got this global warming thing wrong,
421000	426000	and a great way to show this is to say that they predicted global cooling in the 1970s.
426000	430000	Yes, I get it, but don't dress this up as science.
430000	434000	If geologists found evidence that an earthquake is going to hit California,
434000	437000	or a tsunami is about to devastate the coast of Japan,
437000	444000	what kind of individual would want to deliberately manufacture misleading information to discredit them?
