0	11180	In my video, Coronavirus vs Politics, I mentioned that the WHO had announced a global death
11180	13420	rate of 3.4%.
13420	20460	Globally, about 3.4% of reported Covid-19 cases have died.
20460	23400	And that President Trump said he thought that number was false.
23400	27440	Well, I think the 3.4% is really a false number.
27440	32580	So in order to establish the facts, I explained in my video how the figure was derived.
32580	37100	The figure is correct because it's simple maths – the number of deaths at the time
37100	41260	of the study divided by the total number of reported cases.
41260	44060	That's the number of people who've tested positive.
44060	49640	It's known as the case fatality rate, or more colloquially, the death rate.
49640	54100	But judging from the posts on the forum, not everyone got it.
54100	58940	So I'll try to make it easier to understand, this time with analogies and illustrations.
58940	62860	Let's start with the claims that the figure wasn't known.
62860	67260	Well, it was known because it's a simple matter of dividing two numbers for a given
67260	69700	population on a given date.
69700	74380	About 3.4% of reported Covid-19 cases.
74380	81740	And at the time of the statement, the number of reported cases worldwide was 98,192.
81740	86560	And the number of recorded deaths was 3,380.
86560	91620	Just to make sure the WHO got their sums right, I did the calculation myself.
91620	100500	3,380 divided by 98,192 and multiply by 100 to give you the percentage.
100500	106620	That gives you 3.44%, or 3.4% to one decimal place.
106620	108860	So the figure was right.
108860	113300	Epidemiologists call this the CFR, or case fatality rate.
113300	118060	It's not measuring all the infections or all the deaths, it's only measuring the
118060	120900	reported cases and recorded deaths.
120900	123360	And that was clearly spelled out.
123360	127820	So the honest scientific answer is not, we don't know, the honest scientific answer
127820	130500	is 3.4%.
130500	135220	The only way that number can change is if the number of reported worldwide cases and
135220	139720	recorded worldwide deaths up to March 3rd were revised.
139720	142280	But so far they haven't been.
142280	146820	I think one reason for people's confusion is that they assume there's just one number,
146820	149040	one definitive CFR.
149040	150640	In fact, there are many.
150640	155460	As I explained in the video, if you sample global figures at a different time, the CFR
155460	157020	would be different.
157020	163080	So for example, up to September 22nd, the CFR was 3.1%.
163080	167660	Or if you focused on just one part of the world population, like Denmark, the figure
167660	170280	would be different again.
170280	175320	I explained that the CFR will vary from country to country because it's dependent on a number
175320	181140	of variables, such as demographics, quality of healthcare and so on.
181140	186220	To use an analogy, it's a bit like giving world ticket sale figures for the movie Avengers
186220	191760	Endgame up to May 3rd, 2019, as a percentage of population.
192480	195680	Let's say 50 million people saw the movie.
195680	200880	Out of a world population of 7 billion, that would be 0.7%.
200880	205440	The percentage of people in Spain who saw the movie during the same period would obviously
205440	207040	be different.
207040	210920	And the percentage of the world who saw the movie on a different date would be different
210920	212440	again.
212440	217360	You can't say we don't know the global figure up to May 3rd or that it's an estimate
217600	223040	just because ticket sales for different countries on different dates are, not surprisingly,
223040	224040	different.
224040	228840	OK, I'm going to anticipate a flood of posts here along the lines of, we can't be sure
228840	231700	that all the deaths are due to COVID-19.
231700	234320	Some people might have died of natural causes.
234320	239300	But because they coincidentally had COVID, doctors just put it down to COVID.
239300	243560	So that number is an estimate, which means the CFR is wrong.
243560	248840	Firstly, the number in this equation isn't the number of deaths, but the number of recorded
248840	252140	deaths attributed to COVID-19.
252140	257240	Of course, the fatal conditions it causes, like cardiogenic shock, septic shock, multiple
257240	262000	organ failure or respiratory failure, could have happened anyway that same day.
262000	264800	And that's probably true in some patients.
264800	270240	But in most cases, if the patient hadn't contracted COVID-19, he or she might have continued living
270240	273720	for another 10, 20 or even 60 years.
273720	278000	The best way to measure that is something called excess mortality, the number of deaths
278000	281000	above the seasonal average.
281000	283040	And this shows something surprising.
283040	287880	The number of excess deaths in the UK and the USA is actually higher than the number
287880	291360	of recorded deaths due to COVID-19.
291360	295920	So if we take the excess mortality divided by the number of cases, it actually comes
295920	299780	out as more than the CFR, not less.
299820	304140	Most of the posters, though, thought the CFR was wrong for another reason.
304140	309340	They were mixing up the case fatality rate with the infection fatality rate.
309340	315140	For example, imagine thinking 3.4% was the real CFR because you assumed that all cases
315140	317140	were recorded.
317140	321300	But of course the CFR doesn't assume all cases are recorded at all.
321300	323180	It assumes they aren't recorded.
323180	324620	That's the point.
324620	329700	You'll never record all the cases unless you've tested every single person in a population
329700	331700	every single day.
331700	337260	Since that doesn't happen, epidemiologists have to estimate the total number of infections.
337260	341500	And when they divide the number of deaths by the estimated number of infections, that
341500	348680	doesn't give them the CFR, it gives them something called the IFR, the infection fatality rate.
348680	352140	In fact, the WHO explained this back in February.
352140	361420	While the CFR in China at that time was 2.3%, the IFR was estimated at between 0.3 and 1%.
361420	363700	And they explained it again in March.
363700	368400	The data we have so far indicate that the crude mortality rate, the number of reported
368400	373260	deaths divided by the reported cases, is between 3 to 4%.
373260	378860	The infection mortality rate, the number of reported deaths divided by the number of infections,
378860	380380	will be lower.
380380	385500	If the reason still isn't clear, I'll explain the difference with a simple illustration.
385500	391080	Let's say the 12 people in orange are those who've been tested positive for COVID-19.
391080	392760	They're the number of cases.
392760	397440	Two of their number died as a result, and they're marked in red.
397440	402000	So 2 out of 12 is therefore the case fatality rate, the CFR.
402000	408040	And simple maths tells us that that number in this illustration is 16.7%.
408040	414300	The sample size isn't statistically significant, but this is just for the purpose of illustration.
414300	419380	Now let's say there are another 17 people somewhere among the population who had the
419380	423780	virus but their symptoms were so mild they never got tested.
423780	426620	So they obviously don't show up as cases.
426620	428820	We don't even know how many there are.
428820	432660	But epidemiologists can estimate their number through various methods.
432660	436740	Let's say their estimate is 16 people, which is pretty close.
436740	439100	We'll show them in yellow.
439100	445120	If we add those 16 to the 12 others who were recorded, that makes a total of 28 suspected
445120	446780	infections.
446780	452320	So now if we divide the number of deaths, too, by the number of suspected infections,
452320	460560	28, we get the infection fatality rate, or IFR, which in this example is 7.1%.
460560	466240	Some people thought that my IFR figure of roughly 1% was wrong in the earlier video
466240	471220	because they've seen different figures at different times for different populations.
471220	477240	So let me stress again that just like the CFR, there's no single infection fatality
477240	478400	rate.
478400	484120	My figure of around 1% isn't the result of sloppy research, it's the estimated global
484120	487600	figure for that particular time period.
487600	491440	Of course it's going to be different for South Korea and it's going to be different
491440	493160	for Wuhan.
493160	499640	Most IFRs lie between 0.5% and 2% depending on the population, the quality of healthcare
499640	501280	and so on.
501280	506400	And the reason I say about is because even the figure itself is an estimate.
506400	513000	The exact number of infections, unlike the number of cases, isn't known.
513000	517960	The illustrations show why there's a huge difference between the IFR and the CFR, and
517960	523160	why confusing the two very different measurements can mislead you into thinking epidemiologists
523160	525840	have made a mistake.
525840	530640	Some posters gave away the fact that they were confusing the CFR and the IFR by referring
530640	533080	to uncounted cases.
533080	535760	Others gave it away by the low figures they cited.
535760	543800	I mean, obviously the global case fatality rate wasn't 1% on March 3rd, or 0.5%, or
543800	553400	1% to 2% or lower, or less than 1%, or 0.5% to 1.6%, unless my math is shockingly bad.
553400	555840	So where do those figures come from?
555840	560360	Coincidentally they're all within the range of estimates for various infection fatality
560360	565960	rates, which suggests that these posters, like the President, have confused the CFR
565960	568240	with the IFR.
568240	571860	One poster even said that if I played more of the President's interview, I'd see
571860	575020	that he was talking about the figure for uncounted cases.
575020	581460	Yes, I know, that's the infection fatality rate, which is why he was clearly confusing
581460	583340	the two figures.
583340	589260	That's why his claim was wrong.
589260	593780	You can't argue that a figure for a case fatality rate is false simply because you've
593780	597380	mixed it up with a completely different measurement.
597380	601780	I hope those people who didn't understand the difference do now get it, but we'll
601780	602780	see.
602780	606740	My bet is that the next response will be, well, it doesn't matter anyway.
606740	610760	After all, you can't expect a politician to know the difference between the case fatality
610760	615700	rate and the infection fatality rate, even if they are completely different.
615700	617760	That's just splitting hairs.
617760	622820	What he means is that only 1% of people infected will die.
622820	624700	But here's the problem.
624700	629900	If the President of the United States – not just this President, any President – wrongly
629900	634700	believes that the figures he's hearing from scientific bodies are false, that can lead
634700	639900	to policy decisions based on his beliefs rather than actual data.
639900	642340	Sometimes life and death decisions.
642340	647060	And if he goes on national television and, based on that misunderstanding, tells people
647060	653460	WHO epidemiologists are exaggerating the severity of a virus, a lot of them will believe him,
653460	655820	as we've seen from these posts.
655820	659460	And that leads to a distrust in science and complacency.
659460	664680	That's why the media needs to fact-check claims by government leaders and report the
664680	666740	correct figures.
666740	671020	Whether or not you believe that me giving the correct figures will lead to panic, or
671020	676020	you think I'm being disrespectful, subversive or treasonous, as in other countries when
676020	680100	leaders are fact-checked, well that's a matter of opinion.
680100	685800	But a lot of people do want to know the facts, and I think they have every right to know.
685800	688080	Don't they?
688080	691980	My thanks to all those who've donated to the charity Health in Harmony, which I've
691980	697580	asked you to support as a way of supporting my channel, which of course isn't monetised.
697580	702900	Donations from people who follow my channel have now exceeded $100,000, which is fantastic.
702900	708500	It's allowed the charity to expand their healthcare for forest protection into Madagascar
708500	711400	and now into the Shingu region of Brazil.
711400	715820	Details are in the video description if you want to know more about this innovative and
715820	717420	very effective charity.
