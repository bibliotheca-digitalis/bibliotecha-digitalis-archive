00:00.000 --> 00:11.180
In my video, Coronavirus vs Politics, I mentioned that the WHO had announced a global death

00:11.180 --> 00:13.420
rate of 3.4%.

00:13.420 --> 00:20.460
Globally, about 3.4% of reported Covid-19 cases have died.

00:20.460 --> 00:23.400
And that President Trump said he thought that number was false.

00:23.400 --> 00:27.440
Well, I think the 3.4% is really a false number.

00:27.440 --> 00:32.580
So in order to establish the facts, I explained in my video how the figure was derived.

00:32.580 --> 00:37.100
The figure is correct because it's simple maths â€“ the number of deaths at the time

00:37.100 --> 00:41.260
of the study divided by the total number of reported cases.

00:41.260 --> 00:44.060
That's the number of people who've tested positive.

00:44.060 --> 00:49.640
It's known as the case fatality rate, or more colloquially, the death rate.

00:49.640 --> 00:54.100
But judging from the posts on the forum, not everyone got it.

00:54.100 --> 00:58.940
So I'll try to make it easier to understand, this time with analogies and illustrations.

00:58.940 --> 01:02.860
Let's start with the claims that the figure wasn't known.

01:02.860 --> 01:07.260
Well, it was known because it's a simple matter of dividing two numbers for a given

01:07.260 --> 01:09.700
population on a given date.

01:09.700 --> 01:14.380
About 3.4% of reported Covid-19 cases.

01:14.380 --> 01:21.740
And at the time of the statement, the number of reported cases worldwide was 98,192.

01:21.740 --> 01:26.560
And the number of recorded deaths was 3,380.

01:26.560 --> 01:31.620
Just to make sure the WHO got their sums right, I did the calculation myself.

01:31.620 --> 01:40.500
3,380 divided by 98,192 and multiply by 100 to give you the percentage.

01:40.500 --> 01:46.620
That gives you 3.44%, or 3.4% to one decimal place.

01:46.620 --> 01:48.860
So the figure was right.

01:48.860 --> 01:53.300
Epidemiologists call this the CFR, or case fatality rate.

01:53.300 --> 01:58.060
It's not measuring all the infections or all the deaths, it's only measuring the

01:58.060 --> 02:00.900
reported cases and recorded deaths.

02:00.900 --> 02:03.360
And that was clearly spelled out.

02:03.360 --> 02:07.820
So the honest scientific answer is not, we don't know, the honest scientific answer

02:07.820 --> 02:10.500
is 3.4%.

02:10.500 --> 02:15.220
The only way that number can change is if the number of reported worldwide cases and

02:15.220 --> 02:19.720
recorded worldwide deaths up to March 3rd were revised.

02:19.720 --> 02:22.280
But so far they haven't been.

02:22.280 --> 02:26.820
I think one reason for people's confusion is that they assume there's just one number,

02:26.820 --> 02:29.040
one definitive CFR.

02:29.040 --> 02:30.640
In fact, there are many.

02:30.640 --> 02:35.460
As I explained in the video, if you sample global figures at a different time, the CFR

02:35.460 --> 02:37.020
would be different.

02:37.020 --> 02:43.080
So for example, up to September 22nd, the CFR was 3.1%.

02:43.080 --> 02:47.660
Or if you focused on just one part of the world population, like Denmark, the figure

02:47.660 --> 02:50.280
would be different again.

02:50.280 --> 02:55.320
I explained that the CFR will vary from country to country because it's dependent on a number

02:55.320 --> 03:01.140
of variables, such as demographics, quality of healthcare and so on.

03:01.140 --> 03:06.220
To use an analogy, it's a bit like giving world ticket sale figures for the movie Avengers

03:06.220 --> 03:11.760
Endgame up to May 3rd, 2019, as a percentage of population.

03:12.480 --> 03:15.680
Let's say 50 million people saw the movie.

03:15.680 --> 03:20.880
Out of a world population of 7 billion, that would be 0.7%.

03:20.880 --> 03:25.440
The percentage of people in Spain who saw the movie during the same period would obviously

03:25.440 --> 03:27.040
be different.

03:27.040 --> 03:30.920
And the percentage of the world who saw the movie on a different date would be different

03:30.920 --> 03:32.440
again.

03:32.440 --> 03:37.360
You can't say we don't know the global figure up to May 3rd or that it's an estimate

03:37.600 --> 03:43.040
just because ticket sales for different countries on different dates are, not surprisingly,

03:43.040 --> 03:44.040
different.

03:44.040 --> 03:48.840
OK, I'm going to anticipate a flood of posts here along the lines of, we can't be sure

03:48.840 --> 03:51.700
that all the deaths are due to COVID-19.

03:51.700 --> 03:54.320
Some people might have died of natural causes.

03:54.320 --> 03:59.300
But because they coincidentally had COVID, doctors just put it down to COVID.

03:59.300 --> 04:03.560
So that number is an estimate, which means the CFR is wrong.

04:03.560 --> 04:08.840
Firstly, the number in this equation isn't the number of deaths, but the number of recorded

04:08.840 --> 04:12.140
deaths attributed to COVID-19.

04:12.140 --> 04:17.240
Of course, the fatal conditions it causes, like cardiogenic shock, septic shock, multiple

04:17.240 --> 04:22.000
organ failure or respiratory failure, could have happened anyway that same day.

04:22.000 --> 04:24.800
And that's probably true in some patients.

04:24.800 --> 04:30.240
But in most cases, if the patient hadn't contracted COVID-19, he or she might have continued living

04:30.240 --> 04:33.720
for another 10, 20 or even 60 years.

04:33.720 --> 04:38.000
The best way to measure that is something called excess mortality, the number of deaths

04:38.000 --> 04:41.000
above the seasonal average.

04:41.000 --> 04:43.040
And this shows something surprising.

04:43.040 --> 04:47.880
The number of excess deaths in the UK and the USA is actually higher than the number

04:47.880 --> 04:51.360
of recorded deaths due to COVID-19.

04:51.360 --> 04:55.920
So if we take the excess mortality divided by the number of cases, it actually comes

04:55.920 --> 04:59.780
out as more than the CFR, not less.

04:59.820 --> 05:04.140
Most of the posters, though, thought the CFR was wrong for another reason.

05:04.140 --> 05:09.340
They were mixing up the case fatality rate with the infection fatality rate.

05:09.340 --> 05:15.140
For example, imagine thinking 3.4% was the real CFR because you assumed that all cases

05:15.140 --> 05:17.140
were recorded.

05:17.140 --> 05:21.300
But of course the CFR doesn't assume all cases are recorded at all.

05:21.300 --> 05:23.180
It assumes they aren't recorded.

05:23.180 --> 05:24.620
That's the point.

05:24.620 --> 05:29.700
You'll never record all the cases unless you've tested every single person in a population

05:29.700 --> 05:31.700
every single day.

05:31.700 --> 05:37.260
Since that doesn't happen, epidemiologists have to estimate the total number of infections.

05:37.260 --> 05:41.500
And when they divide the number of deaths by the estimated number of infections, that

05:41.500 --> 05:48.680
doesn't give them the CFR, it gives them something called the IFR, the infection fatality rate.

05:48.680 --> 05:52.140
In fact, the WHO explained this back in February.

05:52.140 --> 06:01.420
While the CFR in China at that time was 2.3%, the IFR was estimated at between 0.3 and 1%.

06:01.420 --> 06:03.700
And they explained it again in March.

06:03.700 --> 06:08.400
The data we have so far indicate that the crude mortality rate, the number of reported

06:08.400 --> 06:13.260
deaths divided by the reported cases, is between 3 to 4%.

06:13.260 --> 06:18.860
The infection mortality rate, the number of reported deaths divided by the number of infections,

06:18.860 --> 06:20.380
will be lower.

06:20.380 --> 06:25.500
If the reason still isn't clear, I'll explain the difference with a simple illustration.

06:25.500 --> 06:31.080
Let's say the 12 people in orange are those who've been tested positive for COVID-19.

06:31.080 --> 06:32.760
They're the number of cases.

06:32.760 --> 06:37.440
Two of their number died as a result, and they're marked in red.

06:37.440 --> 06:42.000
So 2 out of 12 is therefore the case fatality rate, the CFR.

06:42.000 --> 06:48.040
And simple maths tells us that that number in this illustration is 16.7%.

06:48.040 --> 06:54.300
The sample size isn't statistically significant, but this is just for the purpose of illustration.

06:54.300 --> 06:59.380
Now let's say there are another 17 people somewhere among the population who had the

06:59.380 --> 07:03.780
virus but their symptoms were so mild they never got tested.

07:03.780 --> 07:06.620
So they obviously don't show up as cases.

07:06.620 --> 07:08.820
We don't even know how many there are.

07:08.820 --> 07:12.660
But epidemiologists can estimate their number through various methods.

07:12.660 --> 07:16.740
Let's say their estimate is 16 people, which is pretty close.

07:16.740 --> 07:19.100
We'll show them in yellow.

07:19.100 --> 07:25.120
If we add those 16 to the 12 others who were recorded, that makes a total of 28 suspected

07:25.120 --> 07:26.780
infections.

07:26.780 --> 07:32.320
So now if we divide the number of deaths, too, by the number of suspected infections,

07:32.320 --> 07:40.560
28, we get the infection fatality rate, or IFR, which in this example is 7.1%.

07:40.560 --> 07:46.240
Some people thought that my IFR figure of roughly 1% was wrong in the earlier video

07:46.240 --> 07:51.220
because they've seen different figures at different times for different populations.

07:51.220 --> 07:57.240
So let me stress again that just like the CFR, there's no single infection fatality

07:57.240 --> 07:58.400
rate.

07:58.400 --> 08:04.120
My figure of around 1% isn't the result of sloppy research, it's the estimated global

08:04.120 --> 08:07.600
figure for that particular time period.

08:07.600 --> 08:11.440
Of course it's going to be different for South Korea and it's going to be different

08:11.440 --> 08:13.160
for Wuhan.

08:13.160 --> 08:19.640
Most IFRs lie between 0.5% and 2% depending on the population, the quality of healthcare

08:19.640 --> 08:21.280
and so on.

08:21.280 --> 08:26.400
And the reason I say about is because even the figure itself is an estimate.

08:26.400 --> 08:33.000
The exact number of infections, unlike the number of cases, isn't known.

08:33.000 --> 08:37.960
The illustrations show why there's a huge difference between the IFR and the CFR, and

08:37.960 --> 08:43.160
why confusing the two very different measurements can mislead you into thinking epidemiologists

08:43.160 --> 08:45.840
have made a mistake.

08:45.840 --> 08:50.640
Some posters gave away the fact that they were confusing the CFR and the IFR by referring

08:50.640 --> 08:53.080
to uncounted cases.

08:53.080 --> 08:55.760
Others gave it away by the low figures they cited.

08:55.760 --> 09:03.800
I mean, obviously the global case fatality rate wasn't 1% on March 3rd, or 0.5%, or

09:03.800 --> 09:13.400
1% to 2% or lower, or less than 1%, or 0.5% to 1.6%, unless my math is shockingly bad.

09:13.400 --> 09:15.840
So where do those figures come from?

09:15.840 --> 09:20.360
Coincidentally they're all within the range of estimates for various infection fatality

09:20.360 --> 09:25.960
rates, which suggests that these posters, like the President, have confused the CFR

09:25.960 --> 09:28.240
with the IFR.

09:28.240 --> 09:31.860
One poster even said that if I played more of the President's interview, I'd see

09:31.860 --> 09:35.020
that he was talking about the figure for uncounted cases.

09:35.020 --> 09:41.460
Yes, I know, that's the infection fatality rate, which is why he was clearly confusing

09:41.460 --> 09:43.340
the two figures.

09:43.340 --> 09:49.260
That's why his claim was wrong.

09:49.260 --> 09:53.780
You can't argue that a figure for a case fatality rate is false simply because you've

09:53.780 --> 09:57.380
mixed it up with a completely different measurement.

09:57.380 --> 10:01.780
I hope those people who didn't understand the difference do now get it, but we'll

10:01.780 --> 10:02.780
see.

10:02.780 --> 10:06.740
My bet is that the next response will be, well, it doesn't matter anyway.

10:06.740 --> 10:10.760
After all, you can't expect a politician to know the difference between the case fatality

10:10.760 --> 10:15.700
rate and the infection fatality rate, even if they are completely different.

10:15.700 --> 10:17.760
That's just splitting hairs.

10:17.760 --> 10:22.820
What he means is that only 1% of people infected will die.

10:22.820 --> 10:24.700
But here's the problem.

10:24.700 --> 10:29.900
If the President of the United States â€“ not just this President, any President â€“ wrongly

10:29.900 --> 10:34.700
believes that the figures he's hearing from scientific bodies are false, that can lead

10:34.700 --> 10:39.900
to policy decisions based on his beliefs rather than actual data.

10:39.900 --> 10:42.340
Sometimes life and death decisions.

10:42.340 --> 10:47.060
And if he goes on national television and, based on that misunderstanding, tells people

10:47.060 --> 10:53.460
WHO epidemiologists are exaggerating the severity of a virus, a lot of them will believe him,

10:53.460 --> 10:55.820
as we've seen from these posts.

10:55.820 --> 10:59.460
And that leads to a distrust in science and complacency.

10:59.460 --> 11:04.680
That's why the media needs to fact-check claims by government leaders and report the

11:04.680 --> 11:06.740
correct figures.

11:06.740 --> 11:11.020
Whether or not you believe that me giving the correct figures will lead to panic, or

11:11.020 --> 11:16.020
you think I'm being disrespectful, subversive or treasonous, as in other countries when

11:16.020 --> 11:20.100
leaders are fact-checked, well that's a matter of opinion.

11:20.100 --> 11:25.800
But a lot of people do want to know the facts, and I think they have every right to know.

11:25.800 --> 11:28.080
Don't they?

11:28.080 --> 11:31.980
My thanks to all those who've donated to the charity Health in Harmony, which I've

11:31.980 --> 11:37.580
asked you to support as a way of supporting my channel, which of course isn't monetised.

11:37.580 --> 11:42.900
Donations from people who follow my channel have now exceeded $100,000, which is fantastic.

11:42.900 --> 11:48.500
It's allowed the charity to expand their healthcare for forest protection into Madagascar

11:48.500 --> 11:51.400
and now into the Shingu region of Brazil.

11:51.400 --> 11:55.820
Details are in the video description if you want to know more about this innovative and

11:55.820 --> 11:57.420
very effective charity.
