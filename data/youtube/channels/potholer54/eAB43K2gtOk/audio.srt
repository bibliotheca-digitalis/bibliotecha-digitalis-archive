1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:11,180
In my video, Coronavirus vs Politics, I mentioned that the WHO had announced a global death

2
00:00:11,180 --> 00:00:13,420
rate of 3.4%.

3
00:00:13,420 --> 00:00:20,460
Globally, about 3.4% of reported Covid-19 cases have died.

4
00:00:20,460 --> 00:00:23,400
And that President Trump said he thought that number was false.

5
00:00:23,400 --> 00:00:27,440
Well, I think the 3.4% is really a false number.

6
00:00:27,440 --> 00:00:32,580
So in order to establish the facts, I explained in my video how the figure was derived.

7
00:00:32,580 --> 00:00:37,100
The figure is correct because it's simple maths – the number of deaths at the time

8
00:00:37,100 --> 00:00:41,260
of the study divided by the total number of reported cases.

9
00:00:41,260 --> 00:00:44,060
That's the number of people who've tested positive.

10
00:00:44,060 --> 00:00:49,640
It's known as the case fatality rate, or more colloquially, the death rate.

11
00:00:49,640 --> 00:00:54,100
But judging from the posts on the forum, not everyone got it.

12
00:00:54,100 --> 00:00:58,940
So I'll try to make it easier to understand, this time with analogies and illustrations.

13
00:00:58,940 --> 00:01:02,860
Let's start with the claims that the figure wasn't known.

14
00:01:02,860 --> 00:01:07,260
Well, it was known because it's a simple matter of dividing two numbers for a given

15
00:01:07,260 --> 00:01:09,700
population on a given date.

16
00:01:09,700 --> 00:01:14,380
About 3.4% of reported Covid-19 cases.

17
00:01:14,380 --> 00:01:21,740
And at the time of the statement, the number of reported cases worldwide was 98,192.

18
00:01:21,740 --> 00:01:26,560
And the number of recorded deaths was 3,380.

19
00:01:26,560 --> 00:01:31,620
Just to make sure the WHO got their sums right, I did the calculation myself.

20
00:01:31,620 --> 00:01:40,500
3,380 divided by 98,192 and multiply by 100 to give you the percentage.

21
00:01:40,500 --> 00:01:46,620
That gives you 3.44%, or 3.4% to one decimal place.

22
00:01:46,620 --> 00:01:48,860
So the figure was right.

23
00:01:48,860 --> 00:01:53,300
Epidemiologists call this the CFR, or case fatality rate.

24
00:01:53,300 --> 00:01:58,060
It's not measuring all the infections or all the deaths, it's only measuring the

25
00:01:58,060 --> 00:02:00,900
reported cases and recorded deaths.

26
00:02:00,900 --> 00:02:03,360
And that was clearly spelled out.

27
00:02:03,360 --> 00:02:07,820
So the honest scientific answer is not, we don't know, the honest scientific answer

28
00:02:07,820 --> 00:02:10,500
is 3.4%.

29
00:02:10,500 --> 00:02:15,220
The only way that number can change is if the number of reported worldwide cases and

30
00:02:15,220 --> 00:02:19,720
recorded worldwide deaths up to March 3rd were revised.

31
00:02:19,720 --> 00:02:22,280
But so far they haven't been.

32
00:02:22,280 --> 00:02:26,820
I think one reason for people's confusion is that they assume there's just one number,

33
00:02:26,820 --> 00:02:29,040
one definitive CFR.

34
00:02:29,040 --> 00:02:30,640
In fact, there are many.

35
00:02:30,640 --> 00:02:35,460
As I explained in the video, if you sample global figures at a different time, the CFR

36
00:02:35,460 --> 00:02:37,020
would be different.

37
00:02:37,020 --> 00:02:43,080
So for example, up to September 22nd, the CFR was 3.1%.

38
00:02:43,080 --> 00:02:47,660
Or if you focused on just one part of the world population, like Denmark, the figure

39
00:02:47,660 --> 00:02:50,280
would be different again.

40
00:02:50,280 --> 00:02:55,320
I explained that the CFR will vary from country to country because it's dependent on a number

41
00:02:55,320 --> 00:03:01,140
of variables, such as demographics, quality of healthcare and so on.

42
00:03:01,140 --> 00:03:06,220
To use an analogy, it's a bit like giving world ticket sale figures for the movie Avengers

43
00:03:06,220 --> 00:03:11,760
Endgame up to May 3rd, 2019, as a percentage of population.

44
00:03:12,480 --> 00:03:15,680
Let's say 50 million people saw the movie.

45
00:03:15,680 --> 00:03:20,880
Out of a world population of 7 billion, that would be 0.7%.

46
00:03:20,880 --> 00:03:25,440
The percentage of people in Spain who saw the movie during the same period would obviously

47
00:03:25,440 --> 00:03:27,040
be different.

48
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:30,920
And the percentage of the world who saw the movie on a different date would be different

49
00:03:30,920 --> 00:03:32,440
again.

50
00:03:32,440 --> 00:03:37,360
You can't say we don't know the global figure up to May 3rd or that it's an estimate

51
00:03:37,600 --> 00:03:43,040
just because ticket sales for different countries on different dates are, not surprisingly,

52
00:03:43,040 --> 00:03:44,040
different.

53
00:03:44,040 --> 00:03:48,840
OK, I'm going to anticipate a flood of posts here along the lines of, we can't be sure

54
00:03:48,840 --> 00:03:51,700
that all the deaths are due to COVID-19.

55
00:03:51,700 --> 00:03:54,320
Some people might have died of natural causes.

56
00:03:54,320 --> 00:03:59,300
But because they coincidentally had COVID, doctors just put it down to COVID.

57
00:03:59,300 --> 00:04:03,560
So that number is an estimate, which means the CFR is wrong.

58
00:04:03,560 --> 00:04:08,840
Firstly, the number in this equation isn't the number of deaths, but the number of recorded

59
00:04:08,840 --> 00:04:12,140
deaths attributed to COVID-19.

60
00:04:12,140 --> 00:04:17,240
Of course, the fatal conditions it causes, like cardiogenic shock, septic shock, multiple

61
00:04:17,240 --> 00:04:22,000
organ failure or respiratory failure, could have happened anyway that same day.

62
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,800
And that's probably true in some patients.

63
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:30,240
But in most cases, if the patient hadn't contracted COVID-19, he or she might have continued living

64
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:33,720
for another 10, 20 or even 60 years.

65
00:04:33,720 --> 00:04:38,000
The best way to measure that is something called excess mortality, the number of deaths

66
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:41,000
above the seasonal average.

67
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:43,040
And this shows something surprising.

68
00:04:43,040 --> 00:04:47,880
The number of excess deaths in the UK and the USA is actually higher than the number

69
00:04:47,880 --> 00:04:51,360
of recorded deaths due to COVID-19.

70
00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:55,920
So if we take the excess mortality divided by the number of cases, it actually comes

71
00:04:55,920 --> 00:04:59,780
out as more than the CFR, not less.

72
00:04:59,820 --> 00:05:04,140
Most of the posters, though, thought the CFR was wrong for another reason.

73
00:05:04,140 --> 00:05:09,340
They were mixing up the case fatality rate with the infection fatality rate.

74
00:05:09,340 --> 00:05:15,140
For example, imagine thinking 3.4% was the real CFR because you assumed that all cases

75
00:05:15,140 --> 00:05:17,140
were recorded.

76
00:05:17,140 --> 00:05:21,300
But of course the CFR doesn't assume all cases are recorded at all.

77
00:05:21,300 --> 00:05:23,180
It assumes they aren't recorded.

78
00:05:23,180 --> 00:05:24,620
That's the point.

79
00:05:24,620 --> 00:05:29,700
You'll never record all the cases unless you've tested every single person in a population

80
00:05:29,700 --> 00:05:31,700
every single day.

81
00:05:31,700 --> 00:05:37,260
Since that doesn't happen, epidemiologists have to estimate the total number of infections.

82
00:05:37,260 --> 00:05:41,500
And when they divide the number of deaths by the estimated number of infections, that

83
00:05:41,500 --> 00:05:48,680
doesn't give them the CFR, it gives them something called the IFR, the infection fatality rate.

84
00:05:48,680 --> 00:05:52,140
In fact, the WHO explained this back in February.

85
00:05:52,140 --> 00:06:01,420
While the CFR in China at that time was 2.3%, the IFR was estimated at between 0.3 and 1%.

86
00:06:01,420 --> 00:06:03,700
And they explained it again in March.

87
00:06:03,700 --> 00:06:08,400
The data we have so far indicate that the crude mortality rate, the number of reported

88
00:06:08,400 --> 00:06:13,260
deaths divided by the reported cases, is between 3 to 4%.

89
00:06:13,260 --> 00:06:18,860
The infection mortality rate, the number of reported deaths divided by the number of infections,

90
00:06:18,860 --> 00:06:20,380
will be lower.

91
00:06:20,380 --> 00:06:25,500
If the reason still isn't clear, I'll explain the difference with a simple illustration.

92
00:06:25,500 --> 00:06:31,080
Let's say the 12 people in orange are those who've been tested positive for COVID-19.

93
00:06:31,080 --> 00:06:32,760
They're the number of cases.

94
00:06:32,760 --> 00:06:37,440
Two of their number died as a result, and they're marked in red.

95
00:06:37,440 --> 00:06:42,000
So 2 out of 12 is therefore the case fatality rate, the CFR.

96
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:48,040
And simple maths tells us that that number in this illustration is 16.7%.

97
00:06:48,040 --> 00:06:54,300
The sample size isn't statistically significant, but this is just for the purpose of illustration.

98
00:06:54,300 --> 00:06:59,380
Now let's say there are another 17 people somewhere among the population who had the

99
00:06:59,380 --> 00:07:03,780
virus but their symptoms were so mild they never got tested.

100
00:07:03,780 --> 00:07:06,620
So they obviously don't show up as cases.

101
00:07:06,620 --> 00:07:08,820
We don't even know how many there are.

102
00:07:08,820 --> 00:07:12,660
But epidemiologists can estimate their number through various methods.

103
00:07:12,660 --> 00:07:16,740
Let's say their estimate is 16 people, which is pretty close.

104
00:07:16,740 --> 00:07:19,100
We'll show them in yellow.

105
00:07:19,100 --> 00:07:25,120
If we add those 16 to the 12 others who were recorded, that makes a total of 28 suspected

106
00:07:25,120 --> 00:07:26,780
infections.

107
00:07:26,780 --> 00:07:32,320
So now if we divide the number of deaths, too, by the number of suspected infections,

108
00:07:32,320 --> 00:07:40,560
28, we get the infection fatality rate, or IFR, which in this example is 7.1%.

109
00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:46,240
Some people thought that my IFR figure of roughly 1% was wrong in the earlier video

110
00:07:46,240 --> 00:07:51,220
because they've seen different figures at different times for different populations.

111
00:07:51,220 --> 00:07:57,240
So let me stress again that just like the CFR, there's no single infection fatality

112
00:07:57,240 --> 00:07:58,400
rate.

113
00:07:58,400 --> 00:08:04,120
My figure of around 1% isn't the result of sloppy research, it's the estimated global

114
00:08:04,120 --> 00:08:07,600
figure for that particular time period.

115
00:08:07,600 --> 00:08:11,440
Of course it's going to be different for South Korea and it's going to be different

116
00:08:11,440 --> 00:08:13,160
for Wuhan.

117
00:08:13,160 --> 00:08:19,640
Most IFRs lie between 0.5% and 2% depending on the population, the quality of healthcare

118
00:08:19,640 --> 00:08:21,280
and so on.

119
00:08:21,280 --> 00:08:26,400
And the reason I say about is because even the figure itself is an estimate.

120
00:08:26,400 --> 00:08:33,000
The exact number of infections, unlike the number of cases, isn't known.

121
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:37,960
The illustrations show why there's a huge difference between the IFR and the CFR, and

122
00:08:37,960 --> 00:08:43,160
why confusing the two very different measurements can mislead you into thinking epidemiologists

123
00:08:43,160 --> 00:08:45,840
have made a mistake.

124
00:08:45,840 --> 00:08:50,640
Some posters gave away the fact that they were confusing the CFR and the IFR by referring

125
00:08:50,640 --> 00:08:53,080
to uncounted cases.

126
00:08:53,080 --> 00:08:55,760
Others gave it away by the low figures they cited.

127
00:08:55,760 --> 00:09:03,800
I mean, obviously the global case fatality rate wasn't 1% on March 3rd, or 0.5%, or

128
00:09:03,800 --> 00:09:13,400
1% to 2% or lower, or less than 1%, or 0.5% to 1.6%, unless my math is shockingly bad.

129
00:09:13,400 --> 00:09:15,840
So where do those figures come from?

130
00:09:15,840 --> 00:09:20,360
Coincidentally they're all within the range of estimates for various infection fatality

131
00:09:20,360 --> 00:09:25,960
rates, which suggests that these posters, like the President, have confused the CFR

132
00:09:25,960 --> 00:09:28,240
with the IFR.

133
00:09:28,240 --> 00:09:31,860
One poster even said that if I played more of the President's interview, I'd see

134
00:09:31,860 --> 00:09:35,020
that he was talking about the figure for uncounted cases.

135
00:09:35,020 --> 00:09:41,460
Yes, I know, that's the infection fatality rate, which is why he was clearly confusing

136
00:09:41,460 --> 00:09:43,340
the two figures.

137
00:09:43,340 --> 00:09:49,260
That's why his claim was wrong.

138
00:09:49,260 --> 00:09:53,780
You can't argue that a figure for a case fatality rate is false simply because you've

139
00:09:53,780 --> 00:09:57,380
mixed it up with a completely different measurement.

140
00:09:57,380 --> 00:10:01,780
I hope those people who didn't understand the difference do now get it, but we'll

141
00:10:01,780 --> 00:10:02,780
see.

142
00:10:02,780 --> 00:10:06,740
My bet is that the next response will be, well, it doesn't matter anyway.

143
00:10:06,740 --> 00:10:10,760
After all, you can't expect a politician to know the difference between the case fatality

144
00:10:10,760 --> 00:10:15,700
rate and the infection fatality rate, even if they are completely different.

145
00:10:15,700 --> 00:10:17,760
That's just splitting hairs.

146
00:10:17,760 --> 00:10:22,820
What he means is that only 1% of people infected will die.

147
00:10:22,820 --> 00:10:24,700
But here's the problem.

148
00:10:24,700 --> 00:10:29,900
If the President of the United States – not just this President, any President – wrongly

149
00:10:29,900 --> 00:10:34,700
believes that the figures he's hearing from scientific bodies are false, that can lead

150
00:10:34,700 --> 00:10:39,900
to policy decisions based on his beliefs rather than actual data.

151
00:10:39,900 --> 00:10:42,340
Sometimes life and death decisions.

152
00:10:42,340 --> 00:10:47,060
And if he goes on national television and, based on that misunderstanding, tells people

153
00:10:47,060 --> 00:10:53,460
WHO epidemiologists are exaggerating the severity of a virus, a lot of them will believe him,

154
00:10:53,460 --> 00:10:55,820
as we've seen from these posts.

155
00:10:55,820 --> 00:10:59,460
And that leads to a distrust in science and complacency.

156
00:10:59,460 --> 00:11:04,680
That's why the media needs to fact-check claims by government leaders and report the

157
00:11:04,680 --> 00:11:06,740
correct figures.

158
00:11:06,740 --> 00:11:11,020
Whether or not you believe that me giving the correct figures will lead to panic, or

159
00:11:11,020 --> 00:11:16,020
you think I'm being disrespectful, subversive or treasonous, as in other countries when

160
00:11:16,020 --> 00:11:20,100
leaders are fact-checked, well that's a matter of opinion.

161
00:11:20,100 --> 00:11:25,800
But a lot of people do want to know the facts, and I think they have every right to know.

162
00:11:25,800 --> 00:11:28,080
Don't they?

My thanks to all those who've donated to the charity Health in Harmony, which I've

164
00:11:31,980 --> 00:11:37,580
asked you to support as a way of supporting my channel, which of course isn't monetised.

165
00:11:37,580 --> 00:11:42,900
Donations from people who follow my channel have now exceeded $100,000, which is fantastic.

166
00:11:42,900 --> 00:11:48,500
It's allowed the charity to expand their healthcare for forest protection into Madagascar

167
00:11:48,500 --> 00:11:51,400
and now into the Shingu region of Brazil.

168
00:11:51,400 --> 00:11:55,820
Details are in the video description if you want to know more about this innovative and

169
00:11:55,820 --> 00:11:57,420
very effective charity.
