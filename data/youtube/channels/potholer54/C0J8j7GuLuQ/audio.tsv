0	4560	After my last response to the academic agent, more on him later in the video,
4560	9360	a few posters defended Congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez
9360	12400	and her comments about the world ending in 12 years.
13360	17600	Posters said her claim was hyperbole, it was meant to sound ludicrous.
18320	22160	You'd have to be a dense motherf****r to think that she wasn't being hyperbolic.
23040	28320	Someone else said I was criticising her because I don't like her anti-conservative politics.
28960	31360	A few people thought she didn't even say it.
32320	34880	Well, she did say it, and here it is.
34880	42160	Millennials and Gen Z and all these folks that come after us are looking up and we're like,
43040	46640	the world is going to end in 12 years if we don't address climate change.
46640	47600	Why 12 years?
48160	54400	Well, a few weeks before AOC made the comments, the IPCC had warned that we had just 12 years
54400	59600	to keep temperatures from rising 1.5 degrees centigrade above pre-industrial levels.
60160	63520	If that didn't happen, it wouldn't mark the end of the world,
63520	68240	but it would mean that there would be very little we could do to stop temperatures rising above
68240	72880	2 degrees centigrade for reasons that are laid out in scientific studies
72880	74880	and which I've explained in other videos.
75600	81280	The report explained the difference between 1.5 degrees and 2 degrees in terms of drought,
81280	85040	coral bleaching, hurricane strength wildfires and so on,
85040	87760	and the difference is considerable and costly.
88800	94320	Intentional or not, AOC took this scientific analysis and exaggerated it to the point of
94320	99440	absurdity. Calling it hyperbole doesn't make it any more acceptable.
100080	105440	People who want to represent the science in the political arena shouldn't be exaggerating.
106080	111200	Defenders of AOC may think scaremongering is necessary to stir people into action.
112000	114560	But the effect is the opposite.
114560	119280	Once you start wildly exaggerating, then no one will believe anything you say.
120480	125280	Worse still, in a country like the United States, where everything has to be a confrontation
125280	131600	between two monolithic sides, critics won't just attribute this exaggeration to AOC,
131600	138480	they'll attribute it to a unified imaginary side, not helped by the fact that AOC herself
138480	140960	claims to be speaking on behalf of millennials.
141760	145440	So her exaggeration will be attributed to an entire generation,
146000	148960	then to anyone who supports her party.
148960	150160	Whoops, it already is.
150720	152720	Then, no doubt, to experts.
153360	155520	And finally, scientists.
155520	158240	And when the world doesn't end in 2030,
158240	162240	of course scientists will be blamed for a failed prediction they never made.
163440	167920	What about the argument of AOC's defenders and AOC herself,
167920	171360	that you have to be stupid not to know she was exaggerating?
172160	177120	But of course most of her detractors know she's exaggerating and they're not stupid.
177840	183600	That's precisely why they're ridiculing her statement and using it to attack science.
184160	186720	And the people on the receiving end of that message
186720	190560	probably do think AOC was being sincere and quite literal.
191200	195840	Have you seen the level of sophistication of the public debate on climate science?
195840	200160	People think the world can't be warming because it's snowing outside their house,
200160	203520	or that it's all a communist plot to take over the world.
203520	207920	They are about to impose a communist world government on the world.
207920	210240	Are they sincere, being hyperbolic?
210880	212560	Hard to tell sometimes, isn't it?
213200	217600	This guy thinks global warming is a lie because heat is lighter than air,
217600	220240	so anything hot will fall into space.
221040	225200	So if you're going to start mixing scientific conclusions with hyperbole,
225200	228400	then of course a bewildered public is going to confuse the two.
229200	231280	It's not their fault, it's yours.
232160	234720	Faced with a variety of extraordinary claims,
234720	238880	how will ordinary people know which of these are wild exaggerations
238880	241520	and which are the conclusions of scientific research?
242400	246160	The answer is that they're all conclusions backed by scientific evidence.
246960	252240	Isn't this reality not concerning enough that some people feel the need to embellish it?
253280	256880	I'm sure I'll get a lot of posts from people saying the misrepresentations
256880	261680	attacking climate science are far more numerous than those exaggerating it,
261680	265280	and that may well be true, based on the fact that I have a hard time
265280	268160	keeping up with the weekly avalanche of the former,
268160	271680	and despite my requests, even critics of climate science
271680	274000	have trouble finding examples of the latter,
274560	279600	which is why just one exaggeration is so easily seized on and exploited.
280240	282960	But the disproportion doesn't excuse it.
282960	285280	When it comes to a misrepresentation of science,
285280	288320	it doesn't matter what side of politics someone's on.
288880	292080	If there are only two sides in this public discourse,
292080	296720	then as far as I'm concerned it's between the side that practices science diligently
296720	301200	and reports it accurately, and the side that misrepresents the science,
301200	302480	whatever their motivation.
303600	308320	And so on to the academic agent who posted a response to me while I was making this video.
309760	314480	Remember I corrected him for erroneously reporting that scientists had predicted this.
314480	317840	They predicted that it may be submerged in 30 years time.
317840	321440	Maldives may be under the sea by the year 2030.
321440	323920	Well, unlike other YouTubers I could mention,
323920	327920	he didn't run away after I showed the evidence that proved his mistakes.
327920	329920	He now accepts that he got it wrong.
329920	334400	So poshola54 has made another reply, and I think he makes a fair point.
334960	340080	In my original video on the Maldives I was somewhat loose with the way I used
340080	344480	the various headlines and I did not track down the journal article in question.
345520	347840	So I'd like to do something rare on this channel.
348720	351920	Now I'm going to admit that I was wrong about something.
352480	359600	I was wrong in my first reply to poshola that this is a case of the media hyping things up
359600	361920	and misrepresenting scientists.
361920	365920	This is not true at all from reading this paper closely.
366480	372160	The call for urgent action is coming from the scientists themselves.
372800	376720	The authors of this paper are quite explicit about this.
376720	380000	Perhaps this shows that the answer to the critics of climate science
380720	386400	is not to match their misrepresentations with your own, but to honestly report the facts.
387760	389680	One last item on the agenda.
389680	393360	I recently got an email from the charity I was asking people to support
393360	396000	in lieu of sending me money for making these videos.
396800	401200	Thanks to your generous donations they've raised around $55,000.
402480	407280	That's paid for the car the medical staff on Borneo desperately needed to get to patients.
407920	411840	It's also allowed them to recruit more doctors and start expanding their
411840	416320	operations into other parts of Indonesia as well as Brazil and Madagascar.
417120	422160	So huge thank you for all your support and if you don't know what the charity is
422160	425920	or what it's about please check out the links in the video description.
