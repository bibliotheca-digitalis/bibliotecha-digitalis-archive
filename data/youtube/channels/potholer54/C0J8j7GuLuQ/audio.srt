1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,560
After my last response to the academic agent, more on him later in the video,

2
00:00:04,560 --> 00:00:09,360
a few posters defended Congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez

3
00:00:09,360 --> 00:00:12,400
and her comments about the world ending in 12 years.

4
00:00:13,360 --> 00:00:17,600
Posters said her claim was hyperbole, it was meant to sound ludicrous.

5
00:00:18,320 --> 00:00:22,160
You'd have to be a dense motherf****r to think that she wasn't being hyperbolic.

6
00:00:23,040 --> 00:00:28,320
Someone else said I was criticising her because I don't like her anti-conservative politics.

7
00:00:28,960 --> 00:00:31,360
A few people thought she didn't even say it.

8
00:00:32,320 --> 00:00:34,880
Well, she did say it, and here it is.

9
00:00:34,880 --> 00:00:42,160
Millennials and Gen Z and all these folks that come after us are looking up and we're like,

10
00:00:43,040 --> 00:00:46,640
the world is going to end in 12 years if we don't address climate change.

11
00:00:46,640 --> 00:00:47,600
Why 12 years?

12
00:00:48,160 --> 00:00:54,400
Well, a few weeks before AOC made the comments, the IPCC had warned that we had just 12 years

13
00:00:54,400 --> 00:00:59,600
to keep temperatures from rising 1.5 degrees centigrade above pre-industrial levels.

14
00:01:00,160 --> 00:01:03,520
If that didn't happen, it wouldn't mark the end of the world,

15
00:01:03,520 --> 00:01:08,240
but it would mean that there would be very little we could do to stop temperatures rising above

16
00:01:08,240 --> 00:01:12,880
2 degrees centigrade for reasons that are laid out in scientific studies

17
00:01:12,880 --> 00:01:14,880
and which I've explained in other videos.

18
00:01:15,600 --> 00:01:21,280
The report explained the difference between 1.5 degrees and 2 degrees in terms of drought,

19
00:01:21,280 --> 00:01:25,040
coral bleaching, hurricane strength wildfires and so on,

20
00:01:25,040 --> 00:01:27,760
and the difference is considerable and costly.

21
00:01:28,800 --> 00:01:34,320
Intentional or not, AOC took this scientific analysis and exaggerated it to the point of

22
00:01:34,320 --> 00:01:39,440
absurdity. Calling it hyperbole doesn't make it any more acceptable.

23
00:01:40,080 --> 00:01:45,440
People who want to represent the science in the political arena shouldn't be exaggerating.

24
00:01:46,080 --> 00:01:51,200
Defenders of AOC may think scaremongering is necessary to stir people into action.

25
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,560
But the effect is the opposite.

26
00:01:54,560 --> 00:01:59,280
Once you start wildly exaggerating, then no one will believe anything you say.

27
00:02:00,480 --> 00:02:05,280
Worse still, in a country like the United States, where everything has to be a confrontation

28
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:11,600
between two monolithic sides, critics won't just attribute this exaggeration to AOC,

29
00:02:11,600 --> 00:02:18,480
they'll attribute it to a unified imaginary side, not helped by the fact that AOC herself

30
00:02:18,480 --> 00:02:20,960
claims to be speaking on behalf of millennials.

31
00:02:21,760 --> 00:02:25,440
So her exaggeration will be attributed to an entire generation,

32
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,960
then to anyone who supports her party.

33
00:02:28,960 --> 00:02:30,160
Whoops, it already is.

34
00:02:30,720 --> 00:02:32,720
Then, no doubt, to experts.

35
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:35,520
And finally, scientists.

36
00:02:35,520 --> 00:02:38,240
And when the world doesn't end in 2030,

37
00:02:38,240 --> 00:02:42,240
of course scientists will be blamed for a failed prediction they never made.

38
00:02:43,440 --> 00:02:47,920
What about the argument of AOC's defenders and AOC herself,

39
00:02:47,920 --> 00:02:51,360
that you have to be stupid not to know she was exaggerating?

40
00:02:52,160 --> 00:02:57,120
But of course most of her detractors know she's exaggerating and they're not stupid.

41
00:02:57,840 --> 00:03:03,600
That's precisely why they're ridiculing her statement and using it to attack science.

42
00:03:04,160 --> 00:03:06,720
And the people on the receiving end of that message

43
00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:10,560
probably do think AOC was being sincere and quite literal.

44
00:03:11,200 --> 00:03:15,840
Have you seen the level of sophistication of the public debate on climate science?

45
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:20,160
People think the world can't be warming because it's snowing outside their house,

46
00:03:20,160 --> 00:03:23,520
or that it's all a communist plot to take over the world.

47
00:03:23,520 --> 00:03:27,920
They are about to impose a communist world government on the world.

48
00:03:27,920 --> 00:03:30,240
Are they sincere, being hyperbolic?

49
00:03:30,880 --> 00:03:32,560
Hard to tell sometimes, isn't it?

50
00:03:33,200 --> 00:03:37,600
This guy thinks global warming is a lie because heat is lighter than air,

51
00:03:37,600 --> 00:03:40,240
so anything hot will fall into space.

52
00:03:41,040 --> 00:03:45,200
So if you're going to start mixing scientific conclusions with hyperbole,

53
00:03:45,200 --> 00:03:48,400
then of course a bewildered public is going to confuse the two.

54
00:03:49,200 --> 00:03:51,280
It's not their fault, it's yours.

55
00:03:52,160 --> 00:03:54,720
Faced with a variety of extraordinary claims,

56
00:03:54,720 --> 00:03:58,880
how will ordinary people know which of these are wild exaggerations

57
00:03:58,880 --> 00:04:01,520
and which are the conclusions of scientific research?

58
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:06,160
The answer is that they're all conclusions backed by scientific evidence.

59
00:04:06,960 --> 00:04:12,240
Isn't this reality not concerning enough that some people feel the need to embellish it?

60
00:04:13,280 --> 00:04:16,880
I'm sure I'll get a lot of posts from people saying the misrepresentations

61
00:04:16,880 --> 00:04:21,680
attacking climate science are far more numerous than those exaggerating it,

62
00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:25,280
and that may well be true, based on the fact that I have a hard time

63
00:04:25,280 --> 00:04:28,160
keeping up with the weekly avalanche of the former,

64
00:04:28,160 --> 00:04:31,680
and despite my requests, even critics of climate science

65
00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:34,000
have trouble finding examples of the latter,

66
00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:39,600
which is why just one exaggeration is so easily seized on and exploited.

67
00:04:40,240 --> 00:04:42,960
But the disproportion doesn't excuse it.

68
00:04:42,960 --> 00:04:45,280
When it comes to a misrepresentation of science,

69
00:04:45,280 --> 00:04:48,320
it doesn't matter what side of politics someone's on.

70
00:04:48,880 --> 00:04:52,080
If there are only two sides in this public discourse,

71
00:04:52,080 --> 00:04:56,720
then as far as I'm concerned it's between the side that practices science diligently

72
00:04:56,720 --> 00:05:01,200
and reports it accurately, and the side that misrepresents the science,

73
00:05:01,200 --> 00:05:02,480
whatever their motivation.

74
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:08,320
And so on to the academic agent who posted a response to me while I was making this video.

75
00:05:09,760 --> 00:05:14,480
Remember I corrected him for erroneously reporting that scientists had predicted this.

76
00:05:14,480 --> 00:05:17,840
They predicted that it may be submerged in 30 years time.

77
00:05:17,840 --> 00:05:21,440
Maldives may be under the sea by the year 2030.

78
00:05:21,440 --> 00:05:23,920
Well, unlike other YouTubers I could mention,

79
00:05:23,920 --> 00:05:27,920
he didn't run away after I showed the evidence that proved his mistakes.

80
00:05:27,920 --> 00:05:29,920
He now accepts that he got it wrong.

81
00:05:29,920 --> 00:05:34,400
So poshola54 has made another reply, and I think he makes a fair point.

82
00:05:34,960 --> 00:05:40,080
In my original video on the Maldives I was somewhat loose with the way I used

83
00:05:40,080 --> 00:05:44,480
the various headlines and I did not track down the journal article in question.

84
00:05:45,520 --> 00:05:47,840
So I'd like to do something rare on this channel.

85
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:51,920
Now I'm going to admit that I was wrong about something.

86
00:05:52,480 --> 00:05:59,600
I was wrong in my first reply to poshola that this is a case of the media hyping things up

87
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:01,920
and misrepresenting scientists.

88
00:06:01,920 --> 00:06:05,920
This is not true at all from reading this paper closely.

89
00:06:06,480 --> 00:06:12,160
The call for urgent action is coming from the scientists themselves.

90
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:16,720
The authors of this paper are quite explicit about this.

91
00:06:16,720 --> 00:06:20,000
Perhaps this shows that the answer to the critics of climate science

92
00:06:20,720 --> 00:06:26,400
is not to match their misrepresentations with your own, but to honestly report the facts.

93
00:06:27,760 --> 00:06:29,680
One last item on the agenda.

94
00:06:29,680 --> 00:06:33,360
I recently got an email from the charity I was asking people to support

95
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:36,000
in lieu of sending me money for making these videos.

96
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:41,200
Thanks to your generous donations they've raised around $55,000.

97
00:06:42,480 --> 00:06:47,280
That's paid for the car the medical staff on Borneo desperately needed to get to patients.

98
00:06:47,920 --> 00:06:51,840
It's also allowed them to recruit more doctors and start expanding their

99
00:06:51,840 --> 00:06:56,320
operations into other parts of Indonesia as well as Brazil and Madagascar.

100
00:06:57,120 --> 00:07:02,160
So huge thank you for all your support and if you don't know what the charity is

101
00:07:02,160 --> 00:07:05,920
or what it's about please check out the links in the video description.
