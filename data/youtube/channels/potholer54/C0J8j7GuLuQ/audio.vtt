00:00.000 --> 00:04.560
After my last response to the academic agent, more on him later in the video,

00:04.560 --> 00:09.360
a few posters defended Congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez

00:09.360 --> 00:12.400
and her comments about the world ending in 12 years.

00:13.360 --> 00:17.600
Posters said her claim was hyperbole, it was meant to sound ludicrous.

00:18.320 --> 00:22.160
You'd have to be a dense motherf****r to think that she wasn't being hyperbolic.

00:23.040 --> 00:28.320
Someone else said I was criticising her because I don't like her anti-conservative politics.

00:28.960 --> 00:31.360
A few people thought she didn't even say it.

00:32.320 --> 00:34.880
Well, she did say it, and here it is.

00:34.880 --> 00:42.160
Millennials and Gen Z and all these folks that come after us are looking up and we're like,

00:43.040 --> 00:46.640
the world is going to end in 12 years if we don't address climate change.

00:46.640 --> 00:47.600
Why 12 years?

00:48.160 --> 00:54.400
Well, a few weeks before AOC made the comments, the IPCC had warned that we had just 12 years

00:54.400 --> 00:59.600
to keep temperatures from rising 1.5 degrees centigrade above pre-industrial levels.

01:00.160 --> 01:03.520
If that didn't happen, it wouldn't mark the end of the world,

01:03.520 --> 01:08.240
but it would mean that there would be very little we could do to stop temperatures rising above

01:08.240 --> 01:12.880
2 degrees centigrade for reasons that are laid out in scientific studies

01:12.880 --> 01:14.880
and which I've explained in other videos.

01:15.600 --> 01:21.280
The report explained the difference between 1.5 degrees and 2 degrees in terms of drought,

01:21.280 --> 01:25.040
coral bleaching, hurricane strength wildfires and so on,

01:25.040 --> 01:27.760
and the difference is considerable and costly.

01:28.800 --> 01:34.320
Intentional or not, AOC took this scientific analysis and exaggerated it to the point of

01:34.320 --> 01:39.440
absurdity. Calling it hyperbole doesn't make it any more acceptable.

01:40.080 --> 01:45.440
People who want to represent the science in the political arena shouldn't be exaggerating.

01:46.080 --> 01:51.200
Defenders of AOC may think scaremongering is necessary to stir people into action.

01:52.000 --> 01:54.560
But the effect is the opposite.

01:54.560 --> 01:59.280
Once you start wildly exaggerating, then no one will believe anything you say.

02:00.480 --> 02:05.280
Worse still, in a country like the United States, where everything has to be a confrontation

02:05.280 --> 02:11.600
between two monolithic sides, critics won't just attribute this exaggeration to AOC,

02:11.600 --> 02:18.480
they'll attribute it to a unified imaginary side, not helped by the fact that AOC herself

02:18.480 --> 02:20.960
claims to be speaking on behalf of millennials.

02:21.760 --> 02:25.440
So her exaggeration will be attributed to an entire generation,

02:26.000 --> 02:28.960
then to anyone who supports her party.

02:28.960 --> 02:30.160
Whoops, it already is.

02:30.720 --> 02:32.720
Then, no doubt, to experts.

02:33.360 --> 02:35.520
And finally, scientists.

02:35.520 --> 02:38.240
And when the world doesn't end in 2030,

02:38.240 --> 02:42.240
of course scientists will be blamed for a failed prediction they never made.

02:43.440 --> 02:47.920
What about the argument of AOC's defenders and AOC herself,

02:47.920 --> 02:51.360
that you have to be stupid not to know she was exaggerating?

02:52.160 --> 02:57.120
But of course most of her detractors know she's exaggerating and they're not stupid.

02:57.840 --> 03:03.600
That's precisely why they're ridiculing her statement and using it to attack science.

03:04.160 --> 03:06.720
And the people on the receiving end of that message

03:06.720 --> 03:10.560
probably do think AOC was being sincere and quite literal.

03:11.200 --> 03:15.840
Have you seen the level of sophistication of the public debate on climate science?

03:15.840 --> 03:20.160
People think the world can't be warming because it's snowing outside their house,

03:20.160 --> 03:23.520
or that it's all a communist plot to take over the world.

03:23.520 --> 03:27.920
They are about to impose a communist world government on the world.

03:27.920 --> 03:30.240
Are they sincere, being hyperbolic?

03:30.880 --> 03:32.560
Hard to tell sometimes, isn't it?

03:33.200 --> 03:37.600
This guy thinks global warming is a lie because heat is lighter than air,

03:37.600 --> 03:40.240
so anything hot will fall into space.

03:41.040 --> 03:45.200
So if you're going to start mixing scientific conclusions with hyperbole,

03:45.200 --> 03:48.400
then of course a bewildered public is going to confuse the two.

03:49.200 --> 03:51.280
It's not their fault, it's yours.

03:52.160 --> 03:54.720
Faced with a variety of extraordinary claims,

03:54.720 --> 03:58.880
how will ordinary people know which of these are wild exaggerations

03:58.880 --> 04:01.520
and which are the conclusions of scientific research?

04:02.400 --> 04:06.160
The answer is that they're all conclusions backed by scientific evidence.

04:06.960 --> 04:12.240
Isn't this reality not concerning enough that some people feel the need to embellish it?

04:13.280 --> 04:16.880
I'm sure I'll get a lot of posts from people saying the misrepresentations

04:16.880 --> 04:21.680
attacking climate science are far more numerous than those exaggerating it,

04:21.680 --> 04:25.280
and that may well be true, based on the fact that I have a hard time

04:25.280 --> 04:28.160
keeping up with the weekly avalanche of the former,

04:28.160 --> 04:31.680
and despite my requests, even critics of climate science

04:31.680 --> 04:34.000
have trouble finding examples of the latter,

04:34.560 --> 04:39.600
which is why just one exaggeration is so easily seized on and exploited.

04:40.240 --> 04:42.960
But the disproportion doesn't excuse it.

04:42.960 --> 04:45.280
When it comes to a misrepresentation of science,

04:45.280 --> 04:48.320
it doesn't matter what side of politics someone's on.

04:48.880 --> 04:52.080
If there are only two sides in this public discourse,

04:52.080 --> 04:56.720
then as far as I'm concerned it's between the side that practices science diligently

04:56.720 --> 05:01.200
and reports it accurately, and the side that misrepresents the science,

05:01.200 --> 05:02.480
whatever their motivation.

05:03.600 --> 05:08.320
And so on to the academic agent who posted a response to me while I was making this video.

05:09.760 --> 05:14.480
Remember I corrected him for erroneously reporting that scientists had predicted this.

05:14.480 --> 05:17.840
They predicted that it may be submerged in 30 years time.

05:17.840 --> 05:21.440
Maldives may be under the sea by the year 2030.

05:21.440 --> 05:23.920
Well, unlike other YouTubers I could mention,

05:23.920 --> 05:27.920
he didn't run away after I showed the evidence that proved his mistakes.

05:27.920 --> 05:29.920
He now accepts that he got it wrong.

05:29.920 --> 05:34.400
So poshola54 has made another reply, and I think he makes a fair point.

05:34.960 --> 05:40.080
In my original video on the Maldives I was somewhat loose with the way I used

05:40.080 --> 05:44.480
the various headlines and I did not track down the journal article in question.

05:45.520 --> 05:47.840
So I'd like to do something rare on this channel.

05:48.720 --> 05:51.920
Now I'm going to admit that I was wrong about something.

05:52.480 --> 05:59.600
I was wrong in my first reply to poshola that this is a case of the media hyping things up

05:59.600 --> 06:01.920
and misrepresenting scientists.

06:01.920 --> 06:05.920
This is not true at all from reading this paper closely.

06:06.480 --> 06:12.160
The call for urgent action is coming from the scientists themselves.

06:12.800 --> 06:16.720
The authors of this paper are quite explicit about this.

06:16.720 --> 06:20.000
Perhaps this shows that the answer to the critics of climate science

06:20.720 --> 06:26.400
is not to match their misrepresentations with your own, but to honestly report the facts.

06:27.760 --> 06:29.680
One last item on the agenda.

06:29.680 --> 06:33.360
I recently got an email from the charity I was asking people to support

06:33.360 --> 06:36.000
in lieu of sending me money for making these videos.

06:36.800 --> 06:41.200
Thanks to your generous donations they've raised around $55,000.

06:42.480 --> 06:47.280
That's paid for the car the medical staff on Borneo desperately needed to get to patients.

06:47.920 --> 06:51.840
It's also allowed them to recruit more doctors and start expanding their

06:51.840 --> 06:56.320
operations into other parts of Indonesia as well as Brazil and Madagascar.

06:57.120 --> 07:02.160
So huge thank you for all your support and if you don't know what the charity is

07:02.160 --> 07:05.920
or what it's about please check out the links in the video description.
