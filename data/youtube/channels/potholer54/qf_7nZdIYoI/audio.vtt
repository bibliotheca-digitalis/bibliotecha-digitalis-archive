00:00.000 --> 00:04.800
There have been a litany of complaints about the World Health Organisation in the popular

00:04.800 --> 00:10.320
and social media, so in this video I'm going to fact check everything from the transmissibility

00:10.320 --> 00:16.440
of the SARS-CoV-2 virus to the effectiveness of face masks. These are the most common complaints

00:16.440 --> 00:21.280
laid out in blogs and newspapers and in a White House letter listing the reasons why

00:21.280 --> 00:27.600
the United States was withdrawing itself and its funding from the WHO.

00:27.600 --> 00:33.080
So let's start with the first complaint in the White House letter, that the WHO consistently

00:33.080 --> 00:40.520
ignored credible reports of the virus spreading in Wuhan in early December 2019, or even earlier,

00:40.520 --> 00:43.440
including reports from the Lancet Medical Journal.

00:43.440 --> 00:50.040
Well, I couldn't find any reports of the virus in early December 2019 in the Lancet.

00:50.040 --> 00:54.640
Even Richard Horton, the Lancet's editor-in-chief, says there's no such report.

00:55.160 --> 00:59.920
Please let me correct the record, he tweeted, the Lancet did not publish any report in early

00:59.920 --> 01:06.560
December 2019 about a virus spreading in Wuhan. Neither could I find any other reports of

01:06.560 --> 01:12.740
a possible virus published in early December, and the letter doesn't cite any. So I turned

01:12.740 --> 01:18.320
to a reputable source, the Congressional Research Service, to find out what reports the White

01:18.320 --> 01:22.740
House is referring to. The CRS's role is to give information to

01:22.780 --> 01:30.060
members of Congress on both sides of the aisle, so it has to be strictly factual and non-partisan.

01:30.060 --> 01:35.660
But they couldn't find any reports prior to December 30th either. The CRS concluded that

01:35.660 --> 01:40.940
the first publicly available reports of the outbreak were on a financial news website

01:40.940 --> 01:47.380
called Yikai on December 31st, Beijing time. Yikai had learned about the outbreak from

01:47.380 --> 01:53.340
this in-house notice sent to hospitals by the Wuhan Municipal Health Commission. The

01:53.340 --> 01:58.900
Yikai report was picked up by several other Chinese websites, including Sina, and the

01:58.900 --> 02:04.460
Sina report was picked up by the Programme for Monitoring Emerging Diseases, PROMED,

02:04.460 --> 02:10.940
an open source platform in the USA. They translated it into English and posted it just three hours

02:10.940 --> 02:16.620
after Yikai had broken the story. A few hours after that, the PROMED story was seen by the

02:16.620 --> 02:22.660
WHO in Geneva. According to the CRS, the WHO contacted the

02:22.660 --> 02:28.140
Chinese authorities the same day and asked for more details, in compliance with the international

02:28.140 --> 02:34.060
health regulations that govern it. So the White House claim that the WHO ignored reports

02:34.060 --> 02:39.460
in early December is false, and the claim that China's media highlighted a new virus

02:39.460 --> 02:46.540
emerging in Wuhan between December 26th and December 30th is also false. The first publicly

02:46.540 --> 02:53.100
available reports were media stories published on December 31st, Beijing time. If the White

02:53.100 --> 02:58.540
House wants to insist that it does have knowledge of reports in early December, then these reports

02:58.540 --> 03:03.300
are known only to the White House, and for some reason it failed to act on the information

03:03.300 --> 03:09.740
at the time or pass it on, and it's unable to cite these reports today.

03:09.740 --> 03:11.620
Let's hear the next claim from a couple of vloggers.

03:11.620 --> 03:26.620
On December 31st, China notified the WHO that there was an issue. Taiwan did the same

03:26.620 --> 03:31.460
thing on the same day with evidence of human-to-human transmission.

03:31.460 --> 03:35.820
This seems to have originated with a claim from Taiwanese health officials, which were

03:35.820 --> 03:42.520
widely reported. Health officials in Taipei say they alerted the WHO at the end of December

03:42.520 --> 03:47.760
about the risk of human-to-human transmission of the new virus, but said its concerns were

03:47.760 --> 03:52.540
not passed on to other countries. The Wall Street Journal took the Taiwanese at their

03:52.540 --> 03:58.260
word. Taiwanese officials warned WHO on December 31st that they had seen evidence that the

03:58.260 --> 04:02.660
virus could be transmitted human-to-human. And of course the claim was copied in the

04:02.660 --> 04:08.960
list of reasons why the USA was withdrawing from the WHO. The WHO chose not to share any

04:08.960 --> 04:13.040
of this critical information with the rest of the world.

04:13.040 --> 04:17.420
But no-one thought to check the email from Taiwan to see if the internet chatter was

04:17.420 --> 04:24.700
true. It's publicly available because Taiwan released a copy. Dated December 31st, it said,

04:24.700 --> 04:29.660
news resources today indicate that at least seven atypical pneumonia cases were reported

04:29.660 --> 04:34.460
in Wuhan China. Their health authorities replied to the media that the cases were

04:34.460 --> 04:39.700
believed not SARS, however the samples are still under examination and cases have been

04:39.700 --> 04:44.780
isolated for treatment. I would greatly appreciate it if you have relevant information to share

04:44.780 --> 04:50.580
with us. So there was no warning of human-to-human transmission.

04:50.580 --> 04:56.700
And where did Taiwan get its information? No, Taiwan explicitly said that its sources

04:56.700 --> 05:03.500
were news resources published on December 31st and the response of the health authorities.

05:03.500 --> 05:08.700
Those are exactly the same sources and the same information that the WHO had on the same

05:08.700 --> 05:14.940
day. There was no critical information that wasn't already known. The email from Taiwan

05:14.940 --> 05:20.860
was simply repeating what ProMed, the WHO and everyone else monitoring China had already

05:20.860 --> 05:25.700
seen, including statements from the Chinese authorities saying that patients had been

05:25.700 --> 05:32.060
put into isolation, which is a standard protocol for suspected infections. In a separate statement

05:32.060 --> 05:37.520
about this timeline, the Taiwanese CDC made no mention of knowing about human-to-human

05:37.520 --> 05:44.100
transmission in December or warning the WHO of human-to-human transmission. They say they

05:44.100 --> 05:48.380
only thought they could be human-to-human transmission when they dispatched experts

05:48.380 --> 05:53.700
to Wuhan in mid-January. By the way, this again dispels the claim that

05:53.700 --> 05:59.220
the Chinese media were reporting a new virus in early December. Taiwan keeps a very close

05:59.220 --> 06:04.820
track of Chinese media and yet, according to the Taiwanese government, it was only alerted

06:04.820 --> 06:11.820
to reports about a possible virus at the same time as the WHO on December 31st. The first

06:11.820 --> 06:16.980
public indication that they had been human-to-human transmission came on January 9th when the

06:16.980 --> 06:23.460
WHO reported, according to Chinese authorities, the virus in question can cause severe illness

06:23.460 --> 06:28.600
in some patients and does not transmit readily between people.

06:28.600 --> 06:33.520
The information prompted the WHO to issue an immediate worldwide alert, saying the route

06:33.520 --> 06:38.900
of transmission was unknown but suspected to be respiratory and that specimens should

06:38.900 --> 06:44.300
be regarded as potentially infectious and that health authorities should assume that

06:44.300 --> 06:49.660
this was a coronavirus with the potential for respiratory spread, in other words human-to-human

06:49.660 --> 06:55.500
transmission. On January 14th, the Wuhan Municipal Health Commission issued a statement

06:55.500 --> 07:00.660
saying there is no clear evidence of human-to-human transmission and that was also passed on by

07:00.660 --> 07:05.500
the WHO. But the WHO omitted the next two lines of

07:05.500 --> 07:11.220
the statement that would have clarified that. We cannot exclude the possibility of human-to-human

07:11.220 --> 07:17.640
transmission, it said, but the risk of continued human-to-human transmission is low. The Chinese

07:17.640 --> 07:22.600
statement was technically correct because there's no definition of the word clear,

07:22.600 --> 07:28.020
but that made it vague and even misleading because it didn't tell the whole story.

07:28.020 --> 07:33.580
As early as December 27th, Dr Zhang Jixiang saw three patients suffering from atypical

07:33.580 --> 07:40.120
pneumonia at her hospital in Wuhan, a father, mother and son. In an interview given months

07:40.120 --> 07:45.680
later with a Chinese magazine, Dr Zhang said she thought it's unlikely that all three

07:45.680 --> 07:50.640
members of a family caught the same disease at the same time unless it's an infectious

07:50.640 --> 07:54.640
disease. So a more informative statement from the Chinese

07:54.640 --> 07:59.340
health authorities would have been that there is some evidence of limited human-to-human

07:59.340 --> 08:05.060
transmission based on the small amount of data available but no clear evidence of sustained

08:05.060 --> 08:09.680
human-to-human transmission. But as well as being obliged to pass on information from

08:09.680 --> 08:16.760
the health authorities in an infected country, the WHO is also free to make its own evaluation.

08:16.760 --> 08:23.160
Which it did, at a news conference the same day. The WHO's Acting Head of Emerging Diseases,

08:23.160 --> 08:28.400
Maria Vanka Kovar, said, from the information that we have, it is possible that there is

08:28.400 --> 08:33.820
limited human-to-human transmission potentially among families, but it's very clear right

08:33.820 --> 08:38.380
now that we have no sustained human-to-human transmission.

08:38.380 --> 08:43.900
According to NPR and the BBC, an anonymous WHO official told their reporters that Dr

08:43.900 --> 08:50.820
Kerkova had been misunderstood. Whoever that official was, he was wrong. Kerkova's statement

08:50.820 --> 08:55.900
was completely accurate based on the data available and very well understood by the

08:55.900 --> 08:59.420
reporters in the room. The news went around the world.

08:59.420 --> 09:05.220
The new coronavirus discovered in China may have had some limited spread among humans.

09:05.220 --> 09:18.780
WHO says new coronavirus could spread, warns hospitals worldwide, world on alert for potential

09:18.780 --> 09:25.180
spread of new SARS-like virus found in China, and so on in Turkey, Singapore, the United

09:25.180 --> 09:30.500
States and elsewhere. In its critical op-ed, the Wall Street Journal

09:30.500 --> 09:37.900
wrote, on January 22nd-23rd, a WHO emergency committee debated whether to declare COVID-19

09:37.900 --> 09:43.700
a public health emergency of international concern. According to the Wall Street Journal,

09:43.700 --> 09:48.720
it should have been an easy decision, despite Beijing's objections. The White House letter

09:48.720 --> 09:55.440
makes the same complaint, claiming that China had put pressure on the WHO. Whether or not

09:55.440 --> 10:00.880
there was pressure applied to the WHO, the decision to declare a public health emergency

10:00.880 --> 10:06.920
is based on the advice of the WHO's International Health Response Committee. They're all independent

10:06.920 --> 10:13.680
experts from different institutes in different countries outside the WHO. They met on January

10:13.680 --> 10:20.680
22nd, but couldn't reach agreement, and deliberations continued into the 23rd. But even on that

10:20.720 --> 10:26.360
second day, they were still evenly split. The explanation given is that while they all

10:26.360 --> 10:31.040
agreed the outbreak should merit a scale-up of awareness, there wasn't a gradation of

10:31.040 --> 10:36.960
warnings that they could call. There's no one-alarm fire or two-alarm fire. It's either

10:36.960 --> 10:42.320
a five-alarm fire or nothing. Declaring a public health emergency of international

10:42.320 --> 10:48.420
concern is a big step because it's the highest alert the WHO can give and triggers a number

10:48.420 --> 10:53.660
of actions that have to be taken by member states. At the time of their meeting, the

10:53.660 --> 10:58.780
city of Wuhan had been put in lockdown, so there was hope that the virus could be contained,

10:58.780 --> 11:04.500
and there were only about 100 cases of coronavirus outside of China. So the committee agreed

11:04.500 --> 11:11.620
a compromise, come back in a week and review the data again. Which they did. And by that

11:11.620 --> 11:16.660
time the virus was clearly not being contained and a public health emergency of international

11:16.660 --> 11:23.940
concern was declared. The question is, was the length of time taken to declare the emergency

11:23.940 --> 11:30.660
unduly long? The designation of a public health emergency of international concern was only

11:30.660 --> 11:35.980
developed in 2005 and has been invoked six times since then.

11:35.980 --> 11:43.580
So let's look at two of the largest. The 2009 H1N1 virus was first reported by the WHO on

11:43.580 --> 11:49.840
March 18th. It crossed into the United States on April 15th and a public health emergency

11:49.840 --> 11:57.860
of international concern was declared on April 25th. That's a gap of just over a month.

11:57.860 --> 12:05.420
The 2014 Ebola virus was first reported to the WHO on March 23rd. The WHO declared the

12:05.420 --> 12:11.220
epidemic a public health emergency of international concern on August 8th. So that's a gap of

12:11.220 --> 12:16.540
over four months. So in terms of time, the emergency declaration for coronavirus at

12:16.540 --> 12:23.780
the end of January was relatively fast. But that could be a reflection of a faster spread.

12:23.780 --> 12:29.300
So next I compared the severity of the two previous largest outbreaks. At the time the

12:29.300 --> 12:35.820
international health emergency was declared on April 25th 2009, there were around 2,000

12:35.820 --> 12:44.980
cases and 149 deaths from H1N1 in two countries. As for the 2014 Ebola outbreak, by the end

12:44.980 --> 12:49.980
of July 27th, two weeks before the public health emergency was declared, there were

12:49.980 --> 12:59.060
already 1,323 cases and 729 deaths spanning three countries.

12:59.060 --> 13:03.340
So the severity of the coronavirus outbreak at the time of the first meeting on January

13:03.340 --> 13:11.500
23rd was nowhere near as bad as for the previous two worse pandemics. A week later it was worse,

13:11.500 --> 13:15.660
which is when a public health emergency was declared.

13:15.660 --> 13:19.980
By the way, a lot of people, including whoever drafted the White House letter, seemed to

13:19.980 --> 13:26.300
think that the WHO declared a pandemic. It didn't. It characterised the virus as a pandemic,

13:26.300 --> 13:31.700
but there wasn't any practical or legal implication to that. The highest level of alert at the

13:31.700 --> 13:38.780
WHO is the public health emergency of international concern, which it had already declared.

13:38.780 --> 13:44.260
Of course, the WHO described this as a pandemic weeks after it fit the WHO's own definition

13:44.260 --> 13:49.460
of a pandemic. It's just that calling it a pandemic didn't change anything. If any

13:49.460 --> 13:54.460
government was ignoring the public health emergency of international concern and waiting

13:54.460 --> 13:59.340
for the virus to be called a pandemic, then it was either ignorant of international health

13:59.340 --> 14:03.800
protocols or completely incompetent.

14:03.800 --> 14:09.300
The Wall Street Journal also took issue with the WHO praising China for its efforts. According

14:09.300 --> 14:13.340
to the White House letter, this is one of the reasons given for defunding and leaving

14:13.340 --> 14:15.340
the WHO.

14:15.340 --> 14:20.260
On January 28th, after meeting with President Xi in Beijing, he praised the Chinese government

14:20.260 --> 14:26.280
for its transparency with respect to the coronavirus, announcing that China had set a new standard

14:26.280 --> 14:30.360
for outbreak control and bought the world time.

14:30.360 --> 14:35.820
So did China deserve such effusive praise? From a human rights perspective, many civil

14:35.820 --> 14:42.020
libertarians would say no. 60 million people were confined to their homes, there was mass

14:42.020 --> 14:47.840
testing, and anyone who tested positive for the virus was forced into isolation. But from

14:47.840 --> 14:54.100
an epidemiological perspective, the actions China took dealt with the virus very effectively.

14:54.100 --> 14:59.820
Two huge hospitals were built from scratch, and a national travel ban slowed the spread.

14:59.820 --> 15:05.100
Wuhan International Airport was shut down. Within a couple of months, most restrictions

15:05.100 --> 15:10.800
had been lifted. Draconian as these actions were, the Chinese government did set a standard

15:10.800 --> 15:16.020
for outbreak control. As the virus spread, most Western countries followed the Chinese

15:16.020 --> 15:23.780
model of a national plan, mass testing, lockdown of hotspots, and mandatory mask wearing.

15:23.780 --> 15:27.880
That doesn't mean these draconian measures were a good thing or a bad thing, or that

15:27.880 --> 15:33.820
containing the virus at the expense of personal liberty and the economy was justified. That's

15:33.820 --> 15:41.620
a matter of opinion. But from an epidemiological perspective, it worked and was widely copied.

15:41.620 --> 15:46.900
In fact, the measures in China were so effective that the WHO wasn't the only voice of praise.

15:46.900 --> 15:51.300
I spoke with President Xi and they're working very, very hard and I think it's going to

15:51.300 --> 15:57.380
all work out fine. He loves his country and he's doing a very good job with a very, very

15:57.380 --> 16:02.460
tough situation. But the issue of transparency is another matter.

16:02.460 --> 16:07.180
Several people criticised me for saying in an earlier video that China was slow in getting

16:07.180 --> 16:13.260
information out and underplayed the virus in its early stages. But examples of that

16:13.260 --> 16:18.780
have been shown in this video as well as my previous two. Even the mayor of Wuhan agreed

16:18.780 --> 16:24.700
that information release was slow. To their credit, the time between China suspecting

16:24.700 --> 16:31.060
a new virus and completely shutting down a city of 10 million people was just three weeks,

16:31.060 --> 16:36.880
which by international standards is remarkably fast. But there was a delay of about a week

16:36.880 --> 16:42.740
in getting information out. There was a pattern of only making important announcements about

16:42.740 --> 16:48.100
the virus after the news had been published in the media. The mayor of Wuhan blamed the

16:48.100 --> 16:53.980
slow release of information on China's tightly controlled society and centralised decision

16:53.980 --> 17:00.300
making. The WHO was well aware of this. In secret recordings obtained by the Associated

17:00.300 --> 17:06.780
Press, officials at the WHO constantly expressed frustration at the slow pace of information

17:06.780 --> 17:14.140
release. For example, China shared the genetic map of the virus with the WHO on January 12th,

17:14.140 --> 17:19.340
which to give them credit was laudably fast. But according to the AP, that was more than

17:19.340 --> 17:24.860
a week after the Chinese government labs had sequenced it, and ten days after Xi Zhengli

17:24.860 --> 17:30.080
at the Wuhan Institute of Virology had sequenced it, according to a statement Xi made several

17:30.080 --> 17:36.500
weeks later. None of this information was shared with the WHO. It was only when a Chinese

17:36.500 --> 17:41.700
research consortium sequenced the virus and released its findings independent of the government

17:41.700 --> 17:47.240
on January 9th that the Chinese authorities released theirs.

17:47.240 --> 17:51.700
So while China might rightly deserve praise for quickly dealing with the virus, why did

17:51.700 --> 17:57.900
the WHO praise it for transparency? According to the leaked recordings, the WHO felt that

17:57.900 --> 18:02.840
criticising the Chinese government wouldn't be at all productive and could result in China

18:02.840 --> 18:08.820
simply refusing to cooperate, for example by not releasing data or refusing to allow

18:08.820 --> 18:15.020
the WHO experts into Wuhan to investigate. What the President's rationale was for praising

18:15.020 --> 18:22.860
China's so-called transparency is a little less clear. China has been working very hard

18:22.860 --> 18:29.460
to contain the coronavirus. The United States greatly appreciates their efforts and transparency.

18:29.460 --> 18:34.820
It will all work out well. On January 12th, the WHO advised against the

18:34.820 --> 18:40.980
application of international travel restrictions because of the new coronavirus. That was criticised

18:40.980 --> 18:46.020
by many commentators and included in the White House letter giving reasons for the US withdrawal

18:46.020 --> 18:51.020
from the WHO. You also praised China's strict domestic travel

18:51.020 --> 18:56.420
restrictions but were inexplicably against my closing of the United States border or

18:56.420 --> 19:02.380
the ban with respect to people coming from China. That's partly correct. The WHO lauded

19:02.380 --> 19:08.200
domestic travel restrictions but advised against international travel restrictions.

19:08.200 --> 19:13.340
From an epidemiological perspective, a virus can't distinguish between provincial and

19:13.340 --> 19:19.320
international boundaries, so what works for one also works for the other.

19:19.320 --> 19:24.780
But it wasn't inexplicable because the WHO did in fact explain the reason travel restrictions

19:24.780 --> 19:30.700
don't stop the spread of a virus. Which is true, but they do slow it down. A study in

19:30.700 --> 19:35.500
the journal Science found that the closure of Wuhan International Airport, for example,

19:35.500 --> 19:39.020
cut case importations in other countries by 80%.

19:39.020 --> 19:44.620
Up to that point, the complaint is correct. Unfortunately, the rest of the complaint needs

19:44.620 --> 19:50.380
some fact checking. The United States border wasn't closed. Flights from China continued

19:50.380 --> 19:55.860
because Americans living in China, Chinese residents in the USA and their families were

19:55.860 --> 20:00.560
still allowed to travel freely. Several of those flights brought the first confirmed

20:00.560 --> 20:07.100
coronavirus cases into the USA and international travel continued unchecked even from heavily

20:07.100 --> 20:13.820
infected countries like Italy. In fact, nearly every country ignored the WHO's advice and

20:13.820 --> 20:19.840
imposed travel restrictions and contrary to the White House claim, the WHO didn't criticise

20:19.840 --> 20:25.600
the United States or any other country for taking these actions.

20:25.600 --> 20:29.840
The White House letter complained that the WHO had downplayed the very serious risk of

20:29.840 --> 20:35.000
asymptomatic spread, telling the world that COVID-19 does not transmit as efficiently

20:35.000 --> 20:40.900
as influenza and that unlike influenza, this disease was not primarily driven by people

20:40.900 --> 20:47.780
who are infected but not yet sick. Well, not quite. Let me just get the quote correct.

20:47.780 --> 20:52.840
The director general of the WHO certainly did say COVID-19 does not transmit as efficiently

20:52.840 --> 20:59.200
as influenza but he added, from the data we have so far. The second quote also had

20:59.200 --> 21:04.680
the caveat that asymptomatic cases of COVID-19 did not appear to be the major drivers of

21:04.680 --> 21:11.720
transmission. Leaving aside the misquotes, was what Tedros actually said correct? The

21:11.720 --> 21:17.780
infectiousness of a virus is measured by the basic reproduction number or the R number.

21:17.780 --> 21:22.420
This is an approximate figure for the average number of people each infected person will

21:23.000 --> 21:28.340
A review paper published in mid February, more than two weeks before Tedros's speech,

21:28.340 --> 21:37.880
found that the R number of SARS-CoV-2 in three separate studies averaged 2.44, 4.2 and 2.67.

21:37.880 --> 21:45.080
Seasonal flu is between 0.9 and 2.1. In other words, SARS-CoV-2 is roughly twice as infectious

21:45.080 --> 21:51.180
as seasonal flu. That evidence was available to Tedros at the time of his speech, so his

21:51.180 --> 21:57.740
statement was incorrect. As for asymptomatic cases not seeming to be the major driver of

21:57.740 --> 22:03.400
transmission, the fact is there was uncertainty as this research paper published just three

22:03.400 --> 22:08.880
days after Tedros's speech shows. But there was also increasing evidence at the time of

22:08.880 --> 22:15.600
the speech of asymptomatic cases spreading the virus. Even so, as late as June, Maria

22:15.600 --> 22:22.140
Van Kerkhove was still saying that asymptomatic transmission was rare. The next day she corrected

22:22.140 --> 22:26.740
her statement to explain that she was talking about a small subset of studies.

22:26.740 --> 22:32.240
I got a few comments in an earlier video forum saying this.

22:32.240 --> 22:37.820
What about WHO, an international body suggesting face masks don't work? Why would you follow

22:37.820 --> 22:42.720
official medical advice when they lied about masks not working?

22:42.720 --> 22:48.800
Well let's start as always by getting the facts straight. The WHO never said masks don't

22:48.800 --> 22:54.180
work. Here's the earliest advice from the WHO given in January and it specifically says

22:54.180 --> 22:59.120
that wearing a medical mask is one of the prevention measures to limit spread of certain

22:59.120 --> 23:06.880
respiratory diseases, including 2019 ENCOV in affected areas. However, it then goes on

23:06.880 --> 23:11.900
to explain that masks are only effective if they are properly worn, properly handled and

23:11.900 --> 23:16.740
accompanied by other preventive measures, like hand washing.

23:16.740 --> 23:22.140
Long before the outbreak of Covid-19, virologists had shown that masks do protect against water

23:22.140 --> 23:27.700
droplets that carry the virus and even smaller particles called aerosols if the mask is a

23:27.700 --> 23:34.220
type N95. The effectiveness in preventing the virus getting through in one study was

23:34.220 --> 23:40.800
68% and 91% respectively. But viruses can also be spread by touching

23:40.800 --> 23:46.880
contaminated surfaces or droplets getting into the eyes. So the effectiveness of masks

23:46.880 --> 23:52.840
depends on proper hygiene. One Hong Kong study found that masks alone had little effect in

23:52.840 --> 23:59.800
reducing the spread of influenza in a group that wore masks but didn't wash their hands.

23:59.800 --> 24:04.640
Masks are even more effective in preventing infected people from spreading the virus.

24:04.640 --> 24:09.940
This test shows droplets, they're visible in green, emanating from someone just talking

24:09.940 --> 24:22.020
without a mask. But wearing a mask stops that completely.

24:22.020 --> 24:26.740
So right from the start of the outbreak the WHO recommended the use of masks for people

24:26.740 --> 24:31.980
with symptoms and healthcare workers because they do work. They didn't recommend it for

24:31.980 --> 24:37.780
the general population at that time because the supply of masks was limited. That was

24:37.780 --> 24:44.200
the same advice given by the CDC and the UK's Chief Medical Advisor for the same reasons.

24:44.200 --> 24:50.920
As more masks became available and the asymptomatic spread of SARS-CoV-2 was discovered, the advice

24:50.920 --> 24:56.620
changed. The claim that masks don't work isn't coming from the WHO, it's coming from people

24:56.620 --> 25:03.480
who distrust or even ignore medical advice. If I hadn't been wearing a mask so much in

25:03.480 --> 25:10.740
the last 10 days or so, I really wonder if I would have gotten it. But I know moving

25:10.740 --> 25:18.280
the mask around, getting it just right, I'm bound to put some virus on the mask that I

25:18.280 --> 25:23.280
sucked in. That's most likely what happened. With respect, sir, if your hand hygiene is

25:23.280 --> 25:28.120
so bad that you think you're spreading the virus onto your mask by touching it, then

25:28.120 --> 25:33.200
it's your filthy hands that are the cause of the problem, not the mask. Masks shouldn't

25:33.240 --> 25:37.820
need constant adjustment anyway. So why are you... Oh, well, if you're going to dress

25:37.820 --> 25:42.480
up like Jesse James, then it's not surprising you have to keep fiddling with this ridiculous

25:42.480 --> 25:48.000
handkerchief tied round the back of your neck. If you want to know how a mask should be worn

25:48.000 --> 25:52.040
and how to wash your hands, the WHO has a helpful guide.

25:52.040 --> 25:58.640
Place the mask on your face, covering your nose, mouth and chin, making sure there are

25:58.640 --> 26:01.720
no gaps between your face and the mask.

26:01.720 --> 26:06.260
Not that, Jesse James. But obviously, no advice on how to wear a mask is going to be

26:06.260 --> 26:09.880
effective if you willfully want to infect other people.

26:09.880 --> 26:16.880
You spent $53, writes this lady. No mask. Only one in the store maskless. No one said

26:16.880 --> 26:20.720
a word. Be brave. Try it. You'll like it.

26:20.720 --> 26:24.580
Well, good for you if you think you're being brave by going into a supermarket without

26:24.580 --> 26:29.520
a mask. But unless you're following hand washing protocols, the mask isn't so much to protect

26:29.520 --> 26:35.360
you, but to protect other people from you if you're carrying the virus. It's a bit like

26:35.360 --> 26:40.320
driving at 80 miles an hour through a busy school zone. You may think you're being brave

26:40.320 --> 26:45.200
by risking your life at such high speeds, but in reality, you're more likely to kill

26:45.200 --> 26:50.640
someone else. The problem is that in many parts of the United States, this isn't seen

26:50.640 --> 26:57.880
as a medical issue, but a political one. Both of these people are members of Congress.

26:57.880 --> 26:59.520
Can you take it up because I cannot hear you?

26:59.520 --> 27:00.600
I'll just speak louder, sir.

27:00.600 --> 27:02.680
Oh, OK. You want to be politically correct.

27:02.680 --> 27:08.560
Why masks are effective and under what circumstances is not a matter of political correctness,

27:08.560 --> 27:14.320
but scientific correctness. I don't know whether the person in this video is a fascist, a communist,

27:14.320 --> 27:20.800
a Democrat or a Republican. Viruses work the same way for everyone. This gets us away from

27:20.800 --> 27:25.580
the point that these complaints about the WHO are factually incorrect. But I thought

27:25.580 --> 27:31.020
it was important not only to explain the WHO's true position on masks, but also why

27:31.020 --> 27:38.100
and how mask wearing is effective, regardless of your political persuasion.

27:38.100 --> 27:42.880
I've already looked at the false claim that Taiwan warned the WHO about human-to-human

27:42.880 --> 27:48.500
transmission back in December. The criticism that the WHO doesn't have a normal relationship

27:48.500 --> 27:54.180
with Taiwan is perfectly true. It doesn't. It can't even acknowledge the existence

27:54.180 --> 27:58.060
of Taiwan as a country, leading to this embarrassing exchange.

27:58.060 --> 28:02.500
Would the WHO consider Taiwan's membership?

28:02.500 --> 28:08.060
At first, Dr Aylward pretended not to hear the question. Then he disconnected the link.

28:08.060 --> 28:13.020
And when the interview resumed, he asked the interviewer to move on. It prompted these

28:13.020 --> 28:19.100
comments in a YouTube forum. It's proof that the WHO has been bought by China or that Dr

28:19.580 --> 28:24.740
Aylward is taking money for his stance, or that this is all some kind of conspiracy.

28:24.740 --> 28:30.260
Actually, the reason Dr Aylward can't answer that question is fairly well known, and it's

28:30.260 --> 28:35.960
been the subject of discussion for the last 40 years. It's not the WHO that gets to decide

28:35.960 --> 28:40.620
whether Taiwan should be a member. It's up to member countries, including the United

28:40.620 --> 28:46.380
States. The reason the WHO doesn't have a normal relationship with Taiwan is because

28:46.380 --> 28:51.860
the United States and other nations, including Taiwan itself, have ruled that Taiwan as a

28:51.860 --> 28:58.860
country doesn't exist. It's a province of China. So by international law, UN agencies,

28:59.340 --> 29:02.820
including the WHO, aren't allowed to officially deal with it.

29:02.820 --> 29:08.780
OK, I know we use the terms China and Taiwan as shorthand, but even Taiwan doesn't officially

29:08.780 --> 29:14.940
call itself Taiwan. By mutual agreement and under international law, there's only one

29:14.940 --> 29:20.180
country, but it has two rival claimants. There's the Republic of China with its government

29:20.180 --> 29:26.860
in Taipei, and the People's Republic of China with its government in Beijing. Both agree

29:26.860 --> 29:32.460
that Taiwan is just a province of their country. Several years ago I came face to face with

29:32.460 --> 29:37.840
this bizarre situation personified when I met the Governor of Taiwan at a Kuomintang

29:37.840 --> 29:43.460
Convention in Taipei. I asked him exactly what he does every day, and the short answer

29:43.500 --> 29:50.140
is not much. Because there's only one country, every nation has to decide which of the two

29:50.140 --> 29:55.580
governments to recognise. And since nearly every country, including the United States,

29:55.580 --> 30:01.660
those churned in red, have now opted to recognise Beijing, it's the People's Republic of China

30:01.660 --> 30:07.420
that occupies China's seat at the United Nations. That's why the USA doesn't have an official

30:07.420 --> 30:13.300
embassy in Taiwan. It's represented by something called the American Institute. It's why

30:13.300 --> 30:18.860
members of the WHO, including the United States when it was a member, have given China's seat

30:18.860 --> 30:25.540
at the WHO to the People's Republic of China, not the Republic of China. It means the People's

30:25.540 --> 30:31.900
Republic of China gets to decide on what terms the province of Taiwan participates in international

30:31.900 --> 30:38.700
gatherings. The WHO can and does have regular unofficial contacts with Taiwan, but it can't

30:38.700 --> 30:44.340
be officially recognised. Taiwan can't even compete in the Olympics or attend international

30:44.340 --> 30:50.380
conferences or join international organisations like APEC under the name of Republic of China.

30:50.380 --> 30:58.340
It has to participate as something called Chinese Taipei. I know, how dare I call Taiwan a province

30:58.340 --> 31:04.500
of China? Well until Taiwan declares independence, which it shows no sign of doing because the

31:04.500 --> 31:10.340
consequences would be far too bloody, both Taipei and Beijing do regard it as a province

31:10.340 --> 31:16.260
of China, so you can't blame Dr Elwood either. He's lumbered with a system imposed on him

31:16.260 --> 31:21.640
by the two Chinas and by members of the United Nations, including the United States, which

31:21.640 --> 31:28.060
chose to recognise Beijing rather than Taipei. If critics want the WHO and other UN bodies

31:28.060 --> 31:33.420
to give Taiwan official recognition, then they need to lobby the US government to switch

31:33.420 --> 31:38.820
recognition from the People's Republic of China to the Republic of China and then get

31:38.820 --> 31:45.960
a majority of UN members to do likewise. Perhaps having a normal relationship in a very abnormal

31:45.960 --> 31:51.660
situation is more complicated than the op-ed writers of the Wall Street Journal and casual

31:51.660 --> 31:57.980
posters on a YouTube video forum assume. It's a shame that the real shortcomings of the

31:57.980 --> 32:03.980
WHO have been buried under an avalanche of false information, fabrications, misquotes

32:03.980 --> 32:09.020
and misrepresentations, exemplified by the White House letter that seems to have been

32:09.020 --> 32:14.980
based on internet myths compiled from blogs. Most of the factually based complaints against

32:14.980 --> 32:23.420
the WHO come from within the scientific community. For example, in July 239 scientists openly

32:23.420 --> 32:31.040
criticised the WHO for not recognising the potential of SARS-CoV-2 spread through aerosols,

32:31.040 --> 32:36.840
in other words micro-droplets less than 5 micrometres in diameter. Some of the signatories

32:36.840 --> 32:42.980
told the New York Times, the Infection Prevention and Control Committee in particular is bound

32:42.980 --> 32:48.780
by a rigid and overly medicalised view of the scientific evidence, is slow and risk-averse

32:48.780 --> 32:55.240
in updating its guidance and allows a few conservative voices to shout down dissent.

32:55.240 --> 32:59.780
Another example, although this is just my opinion and therefore carries as much weight

32:59.780 --> 33:06.080
as an empty thought bubble, the WHO's long-standing travel advice might have been fine for SARS

33:06.080 --> 33:12.260
and MERS and even valid in the early stages of the novel coronavirus, but it wasn't appropriate

33:12.260 --> 33:17.200
by February and should have been changed, especially since part of the rationale was

33:17.200 --> 33:25.100
to prevent business disruption and adverse economic effects. That's not the WHO's job.

33:25.100 --> 33:30.360
And while the WHO was perfectly right and obliged to pass on the information it received

33:30.360 --> 33:37.000
from China, the message it gave was messy and uncoordinated. Its alert to hospitals

33:37.000 --> 33:42.260
on January 5th was clear and concise and should have also gone out in a media release at the

33:42.260 --> 33:47.860
same time. It wasn't reported by the media until nine days later when it was mentioned

33:47.860 --> 33:53.580
at a news conference. The WHO should also have reported the January 14th statements

33:53.580 --> 33:58.780
from the Chinese health authorities in full and Van Gogh-Kover's analysis should have

33:58.780 --> 34:04.280
been included, not just given at the news conference. Fortunately, the media picked

34:04.280 --> 34:10.540
up on the significance of what she said and made it their lead story. Why so many people

34:10.540 --> 34:15.460
didn't know that the WHO had warned of the danger of human-to-human transmission on January

34:15.460 --> 34:21.460
14th or alerted hospitals as far back as January 5th could be because they have their heads

34:21.460 --> 34:25.300
buried in the blogs instead of simply listening to the evening news.

34:25.300 --> 34:29.380
You may have had some limited spread among humans. That's the latest from the World Health

34:29.380 --> 34:35.060
Organisation. When I investigated the WHO's stance on asymptomatic transmissibility and

34:35.060 --> 34:39.920
the reproduction rate, I was surprised to find at least two papers with a high number

34:39.920 --> 34:46.160
of citations that the WHO had apparently overlooked. These problems may be the result

34:46.160 --> 34:52.620
of the WHO's bureaucratic protocols, but that's fixable. None of the world's health authorities

34:52.620 --> 34:58.420
or even the scientists who are sometimes critical of the WHO advocates defunding it because

34:58.420 --> 35:03.280
the work it does in monitoring disease and improving the health of millions of people

35:03.280 --> 35:09.000
is invaluable. And that's especially true in the middle of a pandemic.

35:09.000 --> 35:14.520
If the US administration is concerned about the increasing influence of China at the WHO,

35:14.520 --> 35:20.000
then it should have done what China did and taken active role in the organisation. Instead,

35:20.000 --> 35:25.880
the US seat on the executive board was left unfilled for three long years. It was only

35:25.880 --> 35:31.040
in March this year that the President finally appointed a US representative to fill the

35:31.040 --> 35:37.820
seat, just a few weeks before its withdrawal. And ironically, by withdrawing from the WHO,

35:37.820 --> 35:42.840
the United States is now ensuring the very outcome it wants to prevent. The US withdrawal

35:42.840 --> 35:48.800
is leaving the field wide open to China. I realise that by presenting facts in this video

35:48.800 --> 35:54.440
I'm up against human nature. People tend to believe the first thing they read or hear,

35:54.440 --> 35:59.200
and with so much disinformation on the internet, it's then very hard for them to change their

35:59.200 --> 36:04.280
minds – even when presented with the facts in black and white, which they can read for

36:04.280 --> 36:05.880
themselves.

36:05.880 --> 36:11.120
So before you comment with the usual unsupported cries of, this is all bullshit, take a look

36:11.120 --> 36:16.280
again at the facts, and by all means check them. If you want to maintain that Taiwan

36:16.280 --> 36:21.280
warned about human-to-human transmission, or that the Lancet or anyone else published

36:21.280 --> 36:27.080
an article about the virus in early December, or that the WHO said somewhere that masks

36:27.080 --> 36:33.440
don't work, by all means cite these articles and documents and let everyone read them.

36:33.440 --> 36:37.400
Don't just point to a blog that tells you these things happened and expect everyone

36:37.400 --> 36:42.020
else to share your faith. And if you think it's wrong that Taiwan isn't allowed to

36:42.020 --> 36:48.180
fully participate in United Nations organisations, and I wholeheartedly agree, then instead of

36:48.180 --> 36:54.240
blaming the WHO for a situation not of its making, tell us your solution. Should the

36:54.240 --> 36:59.440
Taiwanese government drop the One China policy and declare independence? Should the United

36:59.440 --> 37:05.280
States switch recognition from Beijing to Taipei? Let's see what workable ideas you

37:05.280 --> 37:07.060
come up with.

37:07.060 --> 37:11.740
If you think the WHO shouldn't have to flatter countries in order to gain access to crucial

37:11.740 --> 37:17.900
medical information, let's hear your solution. Should the WHO be given powers to subpoena

37:17.900 --> 37:23.180
doctors and medical records from a country? Should it have the power to forcibly send

37:23.180 --> 37:28.280
in health specialists even if the host country doesn't want them there? And what should

37:28.280 --> 37:33.980
be the consequences if the target country refuses? Bomb them? I'm really looking forward

37:33.980 --> 37:39.580
to your solutions rather than just the usual mindless criticism.
