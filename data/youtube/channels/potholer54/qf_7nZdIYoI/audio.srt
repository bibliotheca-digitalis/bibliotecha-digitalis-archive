1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,800
There have been a litany of complaints about the World Health Organisation in the popular

2
00:00:04,800 --> 00:00:10,320
and social media, so in this video I'm going to fact check everything from the transmissibility

3
00:00:10,320 --> 00:00:16,440
of the SARS-CoV-2 virus to the effectiveness of face masks. These are the most common complaints

4
00:00:16,440 --> 00:00:21,280
laid out in blogs and newspapers and in a White House letter listing the reasons why

5
00:00:21,280 --> 00:00:27,600
the United States was withdrawing itself and its funding from the WHO.

6
00:00:27,600 --> 00:00:33,080
So let's start with the first complaint in the White House letter, that the WHO consistently

7
00:00:33,080 --> 00:00:40,520
ignored credible reports of the virus spreading in Wuhan in early December 2019, or even earlier,

8
00:00:40,520 --> 00:00:43,440
including reports from the Lancet Medical Journal.

9
00:00:43,440 --> 00:00:50,040
Well, I couldn't find any reports of the virus in early December 2019 in the Lancet.

10
00:00:50,040 --> 00:00:54,640
Even Richard Horton, the Lancet's editor-in-chief, says there's no such report.

11
00:00:55,160 --> 00:00:59,920
Please let me correct the record, he tweeted, the Lancet did not publish any report in early

12
00:00:59,920 --> 00:01:06,560
December 2019 about a virus spreading in Wuhan. Neither could I find any other reports of

13
00:01:06,560 --> 00:01:12,740
a possible virus published in early December, and the letter doesn't cite any. So I turned

14
00:01:12,740 --> 00:01:18,320
to a reputable source, the Congressional Research Service, to find out what reports the White

15
00:01:18,320 --> 00:01:22,740
House is referring to. The CRS's role is to give information to

16
00:01:22,780 --> 00:01:30,060
members of Congress on both sides of the aisle, so it has to be strictly factual and non-partisan.

17
00:01:30,060 --> 00:01:35,660
But they couldn't find any reports prior to December 30th either. The CRS concluded that

18
00:01:35,660 --> 00:01:40,940
the first publicly available reports of the outbreak were on a financial news website

19
00:01:40,940 --> 00:01:47,380
called Yikai on December 31st, Beijing time. Yikai had learned about the outbreak from

20
00:01:47,380 --> 00:01:53,340
this in-house notice sent to hospitals by the Wuhan Municipal Health Commission. The

21
00:01:53,340 --> 00:01:58,900
Yikai report was picked up by several other Chinese websites, including Sina, and the

22
00:01:58,900 --> 00:02:04,460
Sina report was picked up by the Programme for Monitoring Emerging Diseases, PROMED,

23
00:02:04,460 --> 00:02:10,940
an open source platform in the USA. They translated it into English and posted it just three hours

24
00:02:10,940 --> 00:02:16,620
after Yikai had broken the story. A few hours after that, the PROMED story was seen by the

25
00:02:16,620 --> 00:02:22,660
WHO in Geneva. According to the CRS, the WHO contacted the

26
00:02:22,660 --> 00:02:28,140
Chinese authorities the same day and asked for more details, in compliance with the international

27
00:02:28,140 --> 00:02:34,060
health regulations that govern it. So the White House claim that the WHO ignored reports

28
00:02:34,060 --> 00:02:39,460
in early December is false, and the claim that China's media highlighted a new virus

29
00:02:39,460 --> 00:02:46,540
emerging in Wuhan between December 26th and December 30th is also false. The first publicly

30
00:02:46,540 --> 00:02:53,100
available reports were media stories published on December 31st, Beijing time. If the White

31
00:02:53,100 --> 00:02:58,540
House wants to insist that it does have knowledge of reports in early December, then these reports

32
00:02:58,540 --> 00:03:03,300
are known only to the White House, and for some reason it failed to act on the information

33
00:03:03,300 --> 00:03:09,740
at the time or pass it on, and it's unable to cite these reports today.

34
00:03:09,740 --> 00:03:11,620
Let's hear the next claim from a couple of vloggers.

35
00:03:11,620 --> 00:03:26,620
On December 31st, China notified the WHO that there was an issue. Taiwan did the same

36
00:03:26,620 --> 00:03:31,460
thing on the same day with evidence of human-to-human transmission.

37
00:03:31,460 --> 00:03:35,820
This seems to have originated with a claim from Taiwanese health officials, which were

38
00:03:35,820 --> 00:03:42,520
widely reported. Health officials in Taipei say they alerted the WHO at the end of December

39
00:03:42,520 --> 00:03:47,760
about the risk of human-to-human transmission of the new virus, but said its concerns were

40
00:03:47,760 --> 00:03:52,540
not passed on to other countries. The Wall Street Journal took the Taiwanese at their

41
00:03:52,540 --> 00:03:58,260
word. Taiwanese officials warned WHO on December 31st that they had seen evidence that the

42
00:03:58,260 --> 00:04:02,660
virus could be transmitted human-to-human. And of course the claim was copied in the

43
00:04:02,660 --> 00:04:08,960
list of reasons why the USA was withdrawing from the WHO. The WHO chose not to share any

44
00:04:08,960 --> 00:04:13,040
of this critical information with the rest of the world.

45
00:04:13,040 --> 00:04:17,420
But no-one thought to check the email from Taiwan to see if the internet chatter was

46
00:04:17,420 --> 00:04:24,700
true. It's publicly available because Taiwan released a copy. Dated December 31st, it said,

47
00:04:24,700 --> 00:04:29,660
news resources today indicate that at least seven atypical pneumonia cases were reported

48
00:04:29,660 --> 00:04:34,460
in Wuhan China. Their health authorities replied to the media that the cases were

49
00:04:34,460 --> 00:04:39,700
believed not SARS, however the samples are still under examination and cases have been

50
00:04:39,700 --> 00:04:44,780
isolated for treatment. I would greatly appreciate it if you have relevant information to share

51
00:04:44,780 --> 00:04:50,580
with us. So there was no warning of human-to-human transmission.

52
00:04:50,580 --> 00:04:56,700
And where did Taiwan get its information? No, Taiwan explicitly said that its sources

53
00:04:56,700 --> 00:05:03,500
were news resources published on December 31st and the response of the health authorities.

54
00:05:03,500 --> 00:05:08,700
Those are exactly the same sources and the same information that the WHO had on the same

55
00:05:08,700 --> 00:05:14,940
day. There was no critical information that wasn't already known. The email from Taiwan

56
00:05:14,940 --> 00:05:20,860
was simply repeating what ProMed, the WHO and everyone else monitoring China had already

57
00:05:20,860 --> 00:05:25,700
seen, including statements from the Chinese authorities saying that patients had been

58
00:05:25,700 --> 00:05:32,060
put into isolation, which is a standard protocol for suspected infections. In a separate statement

59
00:05:32,060 --> 00:05:37,520
about this timeline, the Taiwanese CDC made no mention of knowing about human-to-human

60
00:05:37,520 --> 00:05:44,100
transmission in December or warning the WHO of human-to-human transmission. They say they

61
00:05:44,100 --> 00:05:48,380
only thought they could be human-to-human transmission when they dispatched experts

62
00:05:48,380 --> 00:05:53,700
to Wuhan in mid-January. By the way, this again dispels the claim that

63
00:05:53,700 --> 00:05:59,220
the Chinese media were reporting a new virus in early December. Taiwan keeps a very close

64
00:05:59,220 --> 00:06:04,820
track of Chinese media and yet, according to the Taiwanese government, it was only alerted

65
00:06:04,820 --> 00:06:11,820
to reports about a possible virus at the same time as the WHO on December 31st. The first

66
00:06:11,820 --> 00:06:16,980
public indication that they had been human-to-human transmission came on January 9th when the

67
00:06:16,980 --> 00:06:23,460
WHO reported, according to Chinese authorities, the virus in question can cause severe illness

68
00:06:23,460 --> 00:06:28,600
in some patients and does not transmit readily between people.

69
00:06:28,600 --> 00:06:33,520
The information prompted the WHO to issue an immediate worldwide alert, saying the route

70
00:06:33,520 --> 00:06:38,900
of transmission was unknown but suspected to be respiratory and that specimens should

71
00:06:38,900 --> 00:06:44,300
be regarded as potentially infectious and that health authorities should assume that

72
00:06:44,300 --> 00:06:49,660
this was a coronavirus with the potential for respiratory spread, in other words human-to-human

73
00:06:49,660 --> 00:06:55,500
transmission. On January 14th, the Wuhan Municipal Health Commission issued a statement

74
00:06:55,500 --> 00:07:00,660
saying there is no clear evidence of human-to-human transmission and that was also passed on by

75
00:07:00,660 --> 00:07:05,500
the WHO. But the WHO omitted the next two lines of

76
00:07:05,500 --> 00:07:11,220
the statement that would have clarified that. We cannot exclude the possibility of human-to-human

77
00:07:11,220 --> 00:07:17,640
transmission, it said, but the risk of continued human-to-human transmission is low. The Chinese

78
00:07:17,640 --> 00:07:22,600
statement was technically correct because there's no definition of the word clear,

79
00:07:22,600 --> 00:07:28,020
but that made it vague and even misleading because it didn't tell the whole story.

80
00:07:28,020 --> 00:07:33,580
As early as December 27th, Dr Zhang Jixiang saw three patients suffering from atypical

81
00:07:33,580 --> 00:07:40,120
pneumonia at her hospital in Wuhan, a father, mother and son. In an interview given months

82
00:07:40,120 --> 00:07:45,680
later with a Chinese magazine, Dr Zhang said she thought it's unlikely that all three

83
00:07:45,680 --> 00:07:50,640
members of a family caught the same disease at the same time unless it's an infectious

84
00:07:50,640 --> 00:07:54,640
disease. So a more informative statement from the Chinese

85
00:07:54,640 --> 00:07:59,340
health authorities would have been that there is some evidence of limited human-to-human

86
00:07:59,340 --> 00:08:05,060
transmission based on the small amount of data available but no clear evidence of sustained

87
00:08:05,060 --> 00:08:09,680
human-to-human transmission. But as well as being obliged to pass on information from

88
00:08:09,680 --> 00:08:16,760
the health authorities in an infected country, the WHO is also free to make its own evaluation.

89
00:08:16,760 --> 00:08:23,160
Which it did, at a news conference the same day. The WHO's Acting Head of Emerging Diseases,

90
00:08:23,160 --> 00:08:28,400
Maria Vanka Kovar, said, from the information that we have, it is possible that there is

91
00:08:28,400 --> 00:08:33,820
limited human-to-human transmission potentially among families, but it's very clear right

92
00:08:33,820 --> 00:08:38,380
now that we have no sustained human-to-human transmission.

93
00:08:38,380 --> 00:08:43,900
According to NPR and the BBC, an anonymous WHO official told their reporters that Dr

94
00:08:43,900 --> 00:08:50,820
Kerkova had been misunderstood. Whoever that official was, he was wrong. Kerkova's statement

95
00:08:50,820 --> 00:08:55,900
was completely accurate based on the data available and very well understood by the

96
00:08:55,900 --> 00:08:59,420
reporters in the room. The news went around the world.

97
00:08:59,420 --> 00:09:05,220
The new coronavirus discovered in China may have had some limited spread among humans.

98
00:09:05,220 --> 00:09:18,780
WHO says new coronavirus could spread, warns hospitals worldwide, world on alert for potential

99
00:09:18,780 --> 00:09:25,180
spread of new SARS-like virus found in China, and so on in Turkey, Singapore, the United

100
00:09:25,180 --> 00:09:30,500
States and elsewhere. In its critical op-ed, the Wall Street Journal

101
00:09:30,500 --> 00:09:37,900
wrote, on January 22nd-23rd, a WHO emergency committee debated whether to declare COVID-19

102
00:09:37,900 --> 00:09:43,700
a public health emergency of international concern. According to the Wall Street Journal,

103
00:09:43,700 --> 00:09:48,720
it should have been an easy decision, despite Beijing's objections. The White House letter

104
00:09:48,720 --> 00:09:55,440
makes the same complaint, claiming that China had put pressure on the WHO. Whether or not

105
00:09:55,440 --> 00:10:00,880
there was pressure applied to the WHO, the decision to declare a public health emergency

106
00:10:00,880 --> 00:10:06,920
is based on the advice of the WHO's International Health Response Committee. They're all independent

107
00:10:06,920 --> 00:10:13,680
experts from different institutes in different countries outside the WHO. They met on January

108
00:10:13,680 --> 00:10:20,680
22nd, but couldn't reach agreement, and deliberations continued into the 23rd. But even on that

109
00:10:20,720 --> 00:10:26,360
second day, they were still evenly split. The explanation given is that while they all

110
00:10:26,360 --> 00:10:31,040
agreed the outbreak should merit a scale-up of awareness, there wasn't a gradation of

111
00:10:31,040 --> 00:10:36,960
warnings that they could call. There's no one-alarm fire or two-alarm fire. It's either

112
00:10:36,960 --> 00:10:42,320
a five-alarm fire or nothing. Declaring a public health emergency of international

113
00:10:42,320 --> 00:10:48,420
concern is a big step because it's the highest alert the WHO can give and triggers a number

114
00:10:48,420 --> 00:10:53,660
of actions that have to be taken by member states. At the time of their meeting, the

115
00:10:53,660 --> 00:10:58,780
city of Wuhan had been put in lockdown, so there was hope that the virus could be contained,

116
00:10:58,780 --> 00:11:04,500
and there were only about 100 cases of coronavirus outside of China. So the committee agreed

117
00:11:04,500 --> 00:11:11,620
a compromise, come back in a week and review the data again. Which they did. And by that

118
00:11:11,620 --> 00:11:16,660
time the virus was clearly not being contained and a public health emergency of international

119
00:11:16,660 --> 00:11:23,940
concern was declared. The question is, was the length of time taken to declare the emergency

120
00:11:23,940 --> 00:11:30,660
unduly long? The designation of a public health emergency of international concern was only

121
00:11:30,660 --> 00:11:35,980
developed in 2005 and has been invoked six times since then.

122
00:11:35,980 --> 00:11:43,580
So let's look at two of the largest. The 2009 H1N1 virus was first reported by the WHO on

123
00:11:43,580 --> 00:11:49,840
March 18th. It crossed into the United States on April 15th and a public health emergency

124
00:11:49,840 --> 00:11:57,860
of international concern was declared on April 25th. That's a gap of just over a month.

125
00:11:57,860 --> 00:12:05,420
The 2014 Ebola virus was first reported to the WHO on March 23rd. The WHO declared the

126
00:12:05,420 --> 00:12:11,220
epidemic a public health emergency of international concern on August 8th. So that's a gap of

127
00:12:11,220 --> 00:12:16,540
over four months. So in terms of time, the emergency declaration for coronavirus at

128
00:12:16,540 --> 00:12:23,780
the end of January was relatively fast. But that could be a reflection of a faster spread.

129
00:12:23,780 --> 00:12:29,300
So next I compared the severity of the two previous largest outbreaks. At the time the

130
00:12:29,300 --> 00:12:35,820
international health emergency was declared on April 25th 2009, there were around 2,000

131
00:12:35,820 --> 00:12:44,980
cases and 149 deaths from H1N1 in two countries. As for the 2014 Ebola outbreak, by the end

132
00:12:44,980 --> 00:12:49,980
of July 27th, two weeks before the public health emergency was declared, there were

133
00:12:49,980 --> 00:12:59,060
already 1,323 cases and 729 deaths spanning three countries.

134
00:12:59,060 --> 00:13:03,340
So the severity of the coronavirus outbreak at the time of the first meeting on January

135
00:13:03,340 --> 00:13:11,500
23rd was nowhere near as bad as for the previous two worse pandemics. A week later it was worse,

136
00:13:11,500 --> 00:13:15,660
which is when a public health emergency was declared.

137
00:13:15,660 --> 00:13:19,980
By the way, a lot of people, including whoever drafted the White House letter, seemed to

138
00:13:19,980 --> 00:13:26,300
think that the WHO declared a pandemic. It didn't. It characterised the virus as a pandemic,

139
00:13:26,300 --> 00:13:31,700
but there wasn't any practical or legal implication to that. The highest level of alert at the

140
00:13:31,700 --> 00:13:38,780
WHO is the public health emergency of international concern, which it had already declared.

141
00:13:38,780 --> 00:13:44,260
Of course, the WHO described this as a pandemic weeks after it fit the WHO's own definition

142
00:13:44,260 --> 00:13:49,460
of a pandemic. It's just that calling it a pandemic didn't change anything. If any

143
00:13:49,460 --> 00:13:54,460
government was ignoring the public health emergency of international concern and waiting

144
00:13:54,460 --> 00:13:59,340
for the virus to be called a pandemic, then it was either ignorant of international health

145
00:13:59,340 --> 00:14:03,800
protocols or completely incompetent.

146
00:14:03,800 --> 00:14:09,300
The Wall Street Journal also took issue with the WHO praising China for its efforts. According

147
00:14:09,300 --> 00:14:13,340
to the White House letter, this is one of the reasons given for defunding and leaving

148
00:14:13,340 --> 00:14:15,340
the WHO.

149
00:14:15,340 --> 00:14:20,260
On January 28th, after meeting with President Xi in Beijing, he praised the Chinese government

150
00:14:20,260 --> 00:14:26,280
for its transparency with respect to the coronavirus, announcing that China had set a new standard

151
00:14:26,280 --> 00:14:30,360
for outbreak control and bought the world time.

152
00:14:30,360 --> 00:14:35,820
So did China deserve such effusive praise? From a human rights perspective, many civil

153
00:14:35,820 --> 00:14:42,020
libertarians would say no. 60 million people were confined to their homes, there was mass

154
00:14:42,020 --> 00:14:47,840
testing, and anyone who tested positive for the virus was forced into isolation. But from

155
00:14:47,840 --> 00:14:54,100
an epidemiological perspective, the actions China took dealt with the virus very effectively.

156
00:14:54,100 --> 00:14:59,820
Two huge hospitals were built from scratch, and a national travel ban slowed the spread.

157
00:14:59,820 --> 00:15:05,100
Wuhan International Airport was shut down. Within a couple of months, most restrictions

158
00:15:05,100 --> 00:15:10,800
had been lifted. Draconian as these actions were, the Chinese government did set a standard

159
00:15:10,800 --> 00:15:16,020
for outbreak control. As the virus spread, most Western countries followed the Chinese

160
00:15:16,020 --> 00:15:23,780
model of a national plan, mass testing, lockdown of hotspots, and mandatory mask wearing.

161
00:15:23,780 --> 00:15:27,880
That doesn't mean these draconian measures were a good thing or a bad thing, or that

162
00:15:27,880 --> 00:15:33,820
containing the virus at the expense of personal liberty and the economy was justified. That's

163
00:15:33,820 --> 00:15:41,620
a matter of opinion. But from an epidemiological perspective, it worked and was widely copied.

164
00:15:41,620 --> 00:15:46,900
In fact, the measures in China were so effective that the WHO wasn't the only voice of praise.

165
00:15:46,900 --> 00:15:51,300
I spoke with President Xi and they're working very, very hard and I think it's going to

166
00:15:51,300 --> 00:15:57,380
all work out fine. He loves his country and he's doing a very good job with a very, very

167
00:15:57,380 --> 00:16:02,460
tough situation. But the issue of transparency is another matter.

168
00:16:02,460 --> 00:16:07,180
Several people criticised me for saying in an earlier video that China was slow in getting

169
00:16:07,180 --> 00:16:13,260
information out and underplayed the virus in its early stages. But examples of that

170
00:16:13,260 --> 00:16:18,780
have been shown in this video as well as my previous two. Even the mayor of Wuhan agreed

171
00:16:18,780 --> 00:16:24,700
that information release was slow. To their credit, the time between China suspecting

172
00:16:24,700 --> 00:16:31,060
a new virus and completely shutting down a city of 10 million people was just three weeks,

173
00:16:31,060 --> 00:16:36,880
which by international standards is remarkably fast. But there was a delay of about a week

174
00:16:36,880 --> 00:16:42,740
in getting information out. There was a pattern of only making important announcements about

175
00:16:42,740 --> 00:16:48,100
the virus after the news had been published in the media. The mayor of Wuhan blamed the

176
00:16:48,100 --> 00:16:53,980
slow release of information on China's tightly controlled society and centralised decision

177
00:16:53,980 --> 00:17:00,300
making. The WHO was well aware of this. In secret recordings obtained by the Associated

178
00:17:00,300 --> 00:17:06,780
Press, officials at the WHO constantly expressed frustration at the slow pace of information

179
00:17:06,780 --> 00:17:14,140
release. For example, China shared the genetic map of the virus with the WHO on January 12th,

180
00:17:14,140 --> 00:17:19,340
which to give them credit was laudably fast. But according to the AP, that was more than

181
00:17:19,340 --> 00:17:24,860
a week after the Chinese government labs had sequenced it, and ten days after Xi Zhengli

182
00:17:24,860 --> 00:17:30,080
at the Wuhan Institute of Virology had sequenced it, according to a statement Xi made several

183
00:17:30,080 --> 00:17:36,500
weeks later. None of this information was shared with the WHO. It was only when a Chinese

184
00:17:36,500 --> 00:17:41,700
research consortium sequenced the virus and released its findings independent of the government

185
00:17:41,700 --> 00:17:47,240
on January 9th that the Chinese authorities released theirs.

186
00:17:47,240 --> 00:17:51,700
So while China might rightly deserve praise for quickly dealing with the virus, why did

187
00:17:51,700 --> 00:17:57,900
the WHO praise it for transparency? According to the leaked recordings, the WHO felt that

188
00:17:57,900 --> 00:18:02,840
criticising the Chinese government wouldn't be at all productive and could result in China

189
00:18:02,840 --> 00:18:08,820
simply refusing to cooperate, for example by not releasing data or refusing to allow

190
00:18:08,820 --> 00:18:15,020
the WHO experts into Wuhan to investigate. What the President's rationale was for praising

191
00:18:15,020 --> 00:18:22,860
China's so-called transparency is a little less clear. China has been working very hard

192
00:18:22,860 --> 00:18:29,460
to contain the coronavirus. The United States greatly appreciates their efforts and transparency.

193
00:18:29,460 --> 00:18:34,820
It will all work out well. On January 12th, the WHO advised against the

194
00:18:34,820 --> 00:18:40,980
application of international travel restrictions because of the new coronavirus. That was criticised

195
00:18:40,980 --> 00:18:46,020
by many commentators and included in the White House letter giving reasons for the US withdrawal

196
00:18:46,020 --> 00:18:51,020
from the WHO. You also praised China's strict domestic travel

197
00:18:51,020 --> 00:18:56,420
restrictions but were inexplicably against my closing of the United States border or

198
00:18:56,420 --> 00:19:02,380
the ban with respect to people coming from China. That's partly correct. The WHO lauded

199
00:19:02,380 --> 00:19:08,200
domestic travel restrictions but advised against international travel restrictions.

200
00:19:08,200 --> 00:19:13,340
From an epidemiological perspective, a virus can't distinguish between provincial and

201
00:19:13,340 --> 00:19:19,320
international boundaries, so what works for one also works for the other.

202
00:19:19,320 --> 00:19:24,780
But it wasn't inexplicable because the WHO did in fact explain the reason travel restrictions

203
00:19:24,780 --> 00:19:30,700
don't stop the spread of a virus. Which is true, but they do slow it down. A study in

204
00:19:30,700 --> 00:19:35,500
the journal Science found that the closure of Wuhan International Airport, for example,

205
00:19:35,500 --> 00:19:39,020
cut case importations in other countries by 80%.

206
00:19:39,020 --> 00:19:44,620
Up to that point, the complaint is correct. Unfortunately, the rest of the complaint needs

207
00:19:44,620 --> 00:19:50,380
some fact checking. The United States border wasn't closed. Flights from China continued

208
00:19:50,380 --> 00:19:55,860
because Americans living in China, Chinese residents in the USA and their families were

209
00:19:55,860 --> 00:20:00,560
still allowed to travel freely. Several of those flights brought the first confirmed

210
00:20:00,560 --> 00:20:07,100
coronavirus cases into the USA and international travel continued unchecked even from heavily

211
00:20:07,100 --> 00:20:13,820
infected countries like Italy. In fact, nearly every country ignored the WHO's advice and

212
00:20:13,820 --> 00:20:19,840
imposed travel restrictions and contrary to the White House claim, the WHO didn't criticise

213
00:20:19,840 --> 00:20:25,600
the United States or any other country for taking these actions.

214
00:20:25,600 --> 00:20:29,840
The White House letter complained that the WHO had downplayed the very serious risk of

215
00:20:29,840 --> 00:20:35,000
asymptomatic spread, telling the world that COVID-19 does not transmit as efficiently

216
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:40,900
as influenza and that unlike influenza, this disease was not primarily driven by people

217
00:20:40,900 --> 00:20:47,780
who are infected but not yet sick. Well, not quite. Let me just get the quote correct.

218
00:20:47,780 --> 00:20:52,840
The director general of the WHO certainly did say COVID-19 does not transmit as efficiently

219
00:20:52,840 --> 00:20:59,200
as influenza but he added, from the data we have so far. The second quote also had

220
00:20:59,200 --> 00:21:04,680
the caveat that asymptomatic cases of COVID-19 did not appear to be the major drivers of

221
00:21:04,680 --> 00:21:11,720
transmission. Leaving aside the misquotes, was what Tedros actually said correct? The

222
00:21:11,720 --> 00:21:17,780
infectiousness of a virus is measured by the basic reproduction number or the R number.

223
00:21:17,780 --> 00:21:22,420
This is an approximate figure for the average number of people each infected person will

224
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:28,340
A review paper published in mid February, more than two weeks before Tedros's speech,

225
00:21:28,340 --> 00:21:37,880
found that the R number of SARS-CoV-2 in three separate studies averaged 2.44, 4.2 and 2.67.

226
00:21:37,880 --> 00:21:45,080
Seasonal flu is between 0.9 and 2.1. In other words, SARS-CoV-2 is roughly twice as infectious

227
00:21:45,080 --> 00:21:51,180
as seasonal flu. That evidence was available to Tedros at the time of his speech, so his

228
00:21:51,180 --> 00:21:57,740
statement was incorrect. As for asymptomatic cases not seeming to be the major driver of

229
00:21:57,740 --> 00:22:03,400
transmission, the fact is there was uncertainty as this research paper published just three

230
00:22:03,400 --> 00:22:08,880
days after Tedros's speech shows. But there was also increasing evidence at the time of

231
00:22:08,880 --> 00:22:15,600
the speech of asymptomatic cases spreading the virus. Even so, as late as June, Maria

232
00:22:15,600 --> 00:22:22,140
Van Kerkhove was still saying that asymptomatic transmission was rare. The next day she corrected

233
00:22:22,140 --> 00:22:26,740
her statement to explain that she was talking about a small subset of studies.

234
00:22:26,740 --> 00:22:32,240
I got a few comments in an earlier video forum saying this.

235
00:22:32,240 --> 00:22:37,820
What about WHO, an international body suggesting face masks don't work? Why would you follow

236
00:22:37,820 --> 00:22:42,720
official medical advice when they lied about masks not working?

237
00:22:42,720 --> 00:22:48,800
Well let's start as always by getting the facts straight. The WHO never said masks don't

238
00:22:48,800 --> 00:22:54,180
work. Here's the earliest advice from the WHO given in January and it specifically says

239
00:22:54,180 --> 00:22:59,120
that wearing a medical mask is one of the prevention measures to limit spread of certain

240
00:22:59,120 --> 00:23:06,880
respiratory diseases, including 2019 ENCOV in affected areas. However, it then goes on

241
00:23:06,880 --> 00:23:11,900
to explain that masks are only effective if they are properly worn, properly handled and

242
00:23:11,900 --> 00:23:16,740
accompanied by other preventive measures, like hand washing.

243
00:23:16,740 --> 00:23:22,140
Long before the outbreak of Covid-19, virologists had shown that masks do protect against water

244
00:23:22,140 --> 00:23:27,700
droplets that carry the virus and even smaller particles called aerosols if the mask is a

245
00:23:27,700 --> 00:23:34,220
type N95. The effectiveness in preventing the virus getting through in one study was

246
00:23:34,220 --> 00:23:40,800
68% and 91% respectively. But viruses can also be spread by touching

247
00:23:40,800 --> 00:23:46,880
contaminated surfaces or droplets getting into the eyes. So the effectiveness of masks

248
00:23:46,880 --> 00:23:52,840
depends on proper hygiene. One Hong Kong study found that masks alone had little effect in

249
00:23:52,840 --> 00:23:59,800
reducing the spread of influenza in a group that wore masks but didn't wash their hands.

250
00:23:59,800 --> 00:24:04,640
Masks are even more effective in preventing infected people from spreading the virus.

251
00:24:04,640 --> 00:24:09,940
This test shows droplets, they're visible in green, emanating from someone just talking

252
00:24:09,940 --> 00:24:22,020
without a mask. But wearing a mask stops that completely.

253
00:24:22,020 --> 00:24:26,740
So right from the start of the outbreak the WHO recommended the use of masks for people

254
00:24:26,740 --> 00:24:31,980
with symptoms and healthcare workers because they do work. They didn't recommend it for

255
00:24:31,980 --> 00:24:37,780
the general population at that time because the supply of masks was limited. That was

256
00:24:37,780 --> 00:24:44,200
the same advice given by the CDC and the UK's Chief Medical Advisor for the same reasons.

257
00:24:44,200 --> 00:24:50,920
As more masks became available and the asymptomatic spread of SARS-CoV-2 was discovered, the advice

258
00:24:50,920 --> 00:24:56,620
changed. The claim that masks don't work isn't coming from the WHO, it's coming from people

259
00:24:56,620 --> 00:25:03,480
who distrust or even ignore medical advice. If I hadn't been wearing a mask so much in

260
00:25:03,480 --> 00:25:10,740
the last 10 days or so, I really wonder if I would have gotten it. But I know moving

261
00:25:10,740 --> 00:25:18,280
the mask around, getting it just right, I'm bound to put some virus on the mask that I

262
00:25:18,280 --> 00:25:23,280
sucked in. That's most likely what happened. With respect, sir, if your hand hygiene is

263
00:25:23,280 --> 00:25:28,120
so bad that you think you're spreading the virus onto your mask by touching it, then

264
00:25:28,120 --> 00:25:33,200
it's your filthy hands that are the cause of the problem, not the mask. Masks shouldn't

265
00:25:33,240 --> 00:25:37,820
need constant adjustment anyway. So why are you... Oh, well, if you're going to dress

266
00:25:37,820 --> 00:25:42,480
up like Jesse James, then it's not surprising you have to keep fiddling with this ridiculous

267
00:25:42,480 --> 00:25:48,000
handkerchief tied round the back of your neck. If you want to know how a mask should be worn

268
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:52,040
and how to wash your hands, the WHO has a helpful guide.

269
00:25:52,040 --> 00:25:58,640
Place the mask on your face, covering your nose, mouth and chin, making sure there are

270
00:25:58,640 --> 00:26:01,720
no gaps between your face and the mask.

271
00:26:01,720 --> 00:26:06,260
Not that, Jesse James. But obviously, no advice on how to wear a mask is going to be

272
00:26:06,260 --> 00:26:09,880
effective if you willfully want to infect other people.

273
00:26:09,880 --> 00:26:16,880
You spent $53, writes this lady. No mask. Only one in the store maskless. No one said

274
00:26:16,880 --> 00:26:20,720
a word. Be brave. Try it. You'll like it.

275
00:26:20,720 --> 00:26:24,580
Well, good for you if you think you're being brave by going into a supermarket without

276
00:26:24,580 --> 00:26:29,520
a mask. But unless you're following hand washing protocols, the mask isn't so much to protect

277
00:26:29,520 --> 00:26:35,360
you, but to protect other people from you if you're carrying the virus. It's a bit like

278
00:26:35,360 --> 00:26:40,320
driving at 80 miles an hour through a busy school zone. You may think you're being brave

279
00:26:40,320 --> 00:26:45,200
by risking your life at such high speeds, but in reality, you're more likely to kill

280
00:26:45,200 --> 00:26:50,640
someone else. The problem is that in many parts of the United States, this isn't seen

281
00:26:50,640 --> 00:26:57,880
as a medical issue, but a political one. Both of these people are members of Congress.

282
00:26:57,880 --> 00:26:59,520
Can you take it up because I cannot hear you?

283
00:26:59,520 --> 00:27:00,600
I'll just speak louder, sir.

284
00:27:00,600 --> 00:27:02,680
Oh, OK. You want to be politically correct.

285
00:27:02,680 --> 00:27:08,560
Why masks are effective and under what circumstances is not a matter of political correctness,

286
00:27:08,560 --> 00:27:14,320
but scientific correctness. I don't know whether the person in this video is a fascist, a communist,

287
00:27:14,320 --> 00:27:20,800
a Democrat or a Republican. Viruses work the same way for everyone. This gets us away from

288
00:27:20,800 --> 00:27:25,580
the point that these complaints about the WHO are factually incorrect. But I thought

289
00:27:25,580 --> 00:27:31,020
it was important not only to explain the WHO's true position on masks, but also why

290
00:27:31,020 --> 00:27:38,100
and how mask wearing is effective, regardless of your political persuasion.

291
00:27:38,100 --> 00:27:42,880
I've already looked at the false claim that Taiwan warned the WHO about human-to-human

292
00:27:42,880 --> 00:27:48,500
transmission back in December. The criticism that the WHO doesn't have a normal relationship

293
00:27:48,500 --> 00:27:54,180
with Taiwan is perfectly true. It doesn't. It can't even acknowledge the existence

294
00:27:54,180 --> 00:27:58,060
of Taiwan as a country, leading to this embarrassing exchange.

295
00:27:58,060 --> 00:28:02,500
Would the WHO consider Taiwan's membership?

296
00:28:02,500 --> 00:28:08,060
At first, Dr Aylward pretended not to hear the question. Then he disconnected the link.

297
00:28:08,060 --> 00:28:13,020
And when the interview resumed, he asked the interviewer to move on. It prompted these

298
00:28:13,020 --> 00:28:19,100
comments in a YouTube forum. It's proof that the WHO has been bought by China or that Dr

299
00:28:19,580 --> 00:28:24,740
Aylward is taking money for his stance, or that this is all some kind of conspiracy.

300
00:28:24,740 --> 00:28:30,260
Actually, the reason Dr Aylward can't answer that question is fairly well known, and it's

301
00:28:30,260 --> 00:28:35,960
been the subject of discussion for the last 40 years. It's not the WHO that gets to decide

302
00:28:35,960 --> 00:28:40,620
whether Taiwan should be a member. It's up to member countries, including the United

303
00:28:40,620 --> 00:28:46,380
States. The reason the WHO doesn't have a normal relationship with Taiwan is because

304
00:28:46,380 --> 00:28:51,860
the United States and other nations, including Taiwan itself, have ruled that Taiwan as a

305
00:28:51,860 --> 00:28:58,860
country doesn't exist. It's a province of China. So by international law, UN agencies,

306
00:28:59,340 --> 00:29:02,820
including the WHO, aren't allowed to officially deal with it.

307
00:29:02,820 --> 00:29:08,780
OK, I know we use the terms China and Taiwan as shorthand, but even Taiwan doesn't officially

308
00:29:08,780 --> 00:29:14,940
call itself Taiwan. By mutual agreement and under international law, there's only one

309
00:29:14,940 --> 00:29:20,180
country, but it has two rival claimants. There's the Republic of China with its government

310
00:29:20,180 --> 00:29:26,860
in Taipei, and the People's Republic of China with its government in Beijing. Both agree

311
00:29:26,860 --> 00:29:32,460
that Taiwan is just a province of their country. Several years ago I came face to face with

312
00:29:32,460 --> 00:29:37,840
this bizarre situation personified when I met the Governor of Taiwan at a Kuomintang

313
00:29:37,840 --> 00:29:43,460
Convention in Taipei. I asked him exactly what he does every day, and the short answer

314
00:29:43,500 --> 00:29:50,140
is not much. Because there's only one country, every nation has to decide which of the two

315
00:29:50,140 --> 00:29:55,580
governments to recognise. And since nearly every country, including the United States,

316
00:29:55,580 --> 00:30:01,660
those churned in red, have now opted to recognise Beijing, it's the People's Republic of China

317
00:30:01,660 --> 00:30:07,420
that occupies China's seat at the United Nations. That's why the USA doesn't have an official

318
00:30:07,420 --> 00:30:13,300
embassy in Taiwan. It's represented by something called the American Institute. It's why

319
00:30:13,300 --> 00:30:18,860
members of the WHO, including the United States when it was a member, have given China's seat

320
00:30:18,860 --> 00:30:25,540
at the WHO to the People's Republic of China, not the Republic of China. It means the People's

321
00:30:25,540 --> 00:30:31,900
Republic of China gets to decide on what terms the province of Taiwan participates in international

322
00:30:31,900 --> 00:30:38,700
gatherings. The WHO can and does have regular unofficial contacts with Taiwan, but it can't

323
00:30:38,700 --> 00:30:44,340
be officially recognised. Taiwan can't even compete in the Olympics or attend international

324
00:30:44,340 --> 00:30:50,380
conferences or join international organisations like APEC under the name of Republic of China.

325
00:30:50,380 --> 00:30:58,340
It has to participate as something called Chinese Taipei. I know, how dare I call Taiwan a province

326
00:30:58,340 --> 00:31:04,500
of China? Well until Taiwan declares independence, which it shows no sign of doing because the

327
00:31:04,500 --> 00:31:10,340
consequences would be far too bloody, both Taipei and Beijing do regard it as a province

328
00:31:10,340 --> 00:31:16,260
of China, so you can't blame Dr Elwood either. He's lumbered with a system imposed on him

329
00:31:16,260 --> 00:31:21,640
by the two Chinas and by members of the United Nations, including the United States, which

330
00:31:21,640 --> 00:31:28,060
chose to recognise Beijing rather than Taipei. If critics want the WHO and other UN bodies

331
00:31:28,060 --> 00:31:33,420
to give Taiwan official recognition, then they need to lobby the US government to switch

332
00:31:33,420 --> 00:31:38,820
recognition from the People's Republic of China to the Republic of China and then get

333
00:31:38,820 --> 00:31:45,960
a majority of UN members to do likewise. Perhaps having a normal relationship in a very abnormal

334
00:31:45,960 --> 00:31:51,660
situation is more complicated than the op-ed writers of the Wall Street Journal and casual

335
00:31:51,660 --> 00:31:57,980
posters on a YouTube video forum assume. It's a shame that the real shortcomings of the

336
00:31:57,980 --> 00:32:03,980
WHO have been buried under an avalanche of false information, fabrications, misquotes

337
00:32:03,980 --> 00:32:09,020
and misrepresentations, exemplified by the White House letter that seems to have been

338
00:32:09,020 --> 00:32:14,980
based on internet myths compiled from blogs. Most of the factually based complaints against

339
00:32:14,980 --> 00:32:23,420
the WHO come from within the scientific community. For example, in July 239 scientists openly

340
00:32:23,420 --> 00:32:31,040
criticised the WHO for not recognising the potential of SARS-CoV-2 spread through aerosols,

341
00:32:31,040 --> 00:32:36,840
in other words micro-droplets less than 5 micrometres in diameter. Some of the signatories

342
00:32:36,840 --> 00:32:42,980
told the New York Times, the Infection Prevention and Control Committee in particular is bound

343
00:32:42,980 --> 00:32:48,780
by a rigid and overly medicalised view of the scientific evidence, is slow and risk-averse

344
00:32:48,780 --> 00:32:55,240
in updating its guidance and allows a few conservative voices to shout down dissent.

345
00:32:55,240 --> 00:32:59,780
Another example, although this is just my opinion and therefore carries as much weight

346
00:32:59,780 --> 00:33:06,080
as an empty thought bubble, the WHO's long-standing travel advice might have been fine for SARS

347
00:33:06,080 --> 00:33:12,260
and MERS and even valid in the early stages of the novel coronavirus, but it wasn't appropriate

348
00:33:12,260 --> 00:33:17,200
by February and should have been changed, especially since part of the rationale was

349
00:33:17,200 --> 00:33:25,100
to prevent business disruption and adverse economic effects. That's not the WHO's job.

350
00:33:25,100 --> 00:33:30,360
And while the WHO was perfectly right and obliged to pass on the information it received

351
00:33:30,360 --> 00:33:37,000
from China, the message it gave was messy and uncoordinated. Its alert to hospitals

352
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:42,260
on January 5th was clear and concise and should have also gone out in a media release at the

353
00:33:42,260 --> 00:33:47,860
same time. It wasn't reported by the media until nine days later when it was mentioned

354
00:33:47,860 --> 00:33:53,580
at a news conference. The WHO should also have reported the January 14th statements

355
00:33:53,580 --> 00:33:58,780
from the Chinese health authorities in full and Van Gogh-Kover's analysis should have

356
00:33:58,780 --> 00:34:04,280
been included, not just given at the news conference. Fortunately, the media picked

357
00:34:04,280 --> 00:34:10,540
up on the significance of what she said and made it their lead story. Why so many people

358
00:34:10,540 --> 00:34:15,460
didn't know that the WHO had warned of the danger of human-to-human transmission on January

359
00:34:15,460 --> 00:34:21,460
14th or alerted hospitals as far back as January 5th could be because they have their heads

360
00:34:21,460 --> 00:34:25,300
buried in the blogs instead of simply listening to the evening news.

361
00:34:25,300 --> 00:34:29,380
You may have had some limited spread among humans. That's the latest from the World Health

362
00:34:29,380 --> 00:34:35,060
Organisation. When I investigated the WHO's stance on asymptomatic transmissibility and

363
00:34:35,060 --> 00:34:39,920
the reproduction rate, I was surprised to find at least two papers with a high number

364
00:34:39,920 --> 00:34:46,160
of citations that the WHO had apparently overlooked. These problems may be the result

365
00:34:46,160 --> 00:34:52,620
of the WHO's bureaucratic protocols, but that's fixable. None of the world's health authorities

366
00:34:52,620 --> 00:34:58,420
or even the scientists who are sometimes critical of the WHO advocates defunding it because

367
00:34:58,420 --> 00:35:03,280
the work it does in monitoring disease and improving the health of millions of people

368
00:35:03,280 --> 00:35:09,000
is invaluable. And that's especially true in the middle of a pandemic.

369
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:14,520
If the US administration is concerned about the increasing influence of China at the WHO,

370
00:35:14,520 --> 00:35:20,000
then it should have done what China did and taken active role in the organisation. Instead,

371
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:25,880
the US seat on the executive board was left unfilled for three long years. It was only

372
00:35:25,880 --> 00:35:31,040
in March this year that the President finally appointed a US representative to fill the

373
00:35:31,040 --> 00:35:37,820
seat, just a few weeks before its withdrawal. And ironically, by withdrawing from the WHO,

374
00:35:37,820 --> 00:35:42,840
the United States is now ensuring the very outcome it wants to prevent. The US withdrawal

375
00:35:42,840 --> 00:35:48,800
is leaving the field wide open to China. I realise that by presenting facts in this video

376
00:35:48,800 --> 00:35:54,440
I'm up against human nature. People tend to believe the first thing they read or hear,

377
00:35:54,440 --> 00:35:59,200
and with so much disinformation on the internet, it's then very hard for them to change their

378
00:35:59,200 --> 00:36:04,280
minds – even when presented with the facts in black and white, which they can read for

379
00:36:04,280 --> 00:36:05,880
themselves.

380
00:36:05,880 --> 00:36:11,120
So before you comment with the usual unsupported cries of, this is all bullshit, take a look

381
00:36:11,120 --> 00:36:16,280
again at the facts, and by all means check them. If you want to maintain that Taiwan

382
00:36:16,280 --> 00:36:21,280
warned about human-to-human transmission, or that the Lancet or anyone else published

383
00:36:21,280 --> 00:36:27,080
an article about the virus in early December, or that the WHO said somewhere that masks

384
00:36:27,080 --> 00:36:33,440
don't work, by all means cite these articles and documents and let everyone read them.

385
00:36:33,440 --> 00:36:37,400
Don't just point to a blog that tells you these things happened and expect everyone

386
00:36:37,400 --> 00:36:42,020
else to share your faith. And if you think it's wrong that Taiwan isn't allowed to

387
00:36:42,020 --> 00:36:48,180
fully participate in United Nations organisations, and I wholeheartedly agree, then instead of

388
00:36:48,180 --> 00:36:54,240
blaming the WHO for a situation not of its making, tell us your solution. Should the

389
00:36:54,240 --> 00:36:59,440
Taiwanese government drop the One China policy and declare independence? Should the United

390
00:36:59,440 --> 00:37:05,280
States switch recognition from Beijing to Taipei? Let's see what workable ideas you

391
00:37:05,280 --> 00:37:07,060
come up with.

392
00:37:07,060 --> 00:37:11,740
If you think the WHO shouldn't have to flatter countries in order to gain access to crucial

393
00:37:11,740 --> 00:37:17,900
medical information, let's hear your solution. Should the WHO be given powers to subpoena

394
00:37:17,900 --> 00:37:23,180
doctors and medical records from a country? Should it have the power to forcibly send

395
00:37:23,180 --> 00:37:28,280
in health specialists even if the host country doesn't want them there? And what should

396
00:37:28,280 --> 00:37:33,980
be the consequences if the target country refuses? Bomb them? I'm really looking forward

397
00:37:33,980 --> 00:37:39,580
to your solutions rather than just the usual mindless criticism.
