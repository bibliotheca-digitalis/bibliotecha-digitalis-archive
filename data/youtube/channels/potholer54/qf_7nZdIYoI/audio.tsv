0	4800	There have been a litany of complaints about the World Health Organisation in the popular
4800	10320	and social media, so in this video I'm going to fact check everything from the transmissibility
10320	16440	of the SARS-CoV-2 virus to the effectiveness of face masks. These are the most common complaints
16440	21280	laid out in blogs and newspapers and in a White House letter listing the reasons why
21280	27600	the United States was withdrawing itself and its funding from the WHO.
27600	33080	So let's start with the first complaint in the White House letter, that the WHO consistently
33080	40520	ignored credible reports of the virus spreading in Wuhan in early December 2019, or even earlier,
40520	43440	including reports from the Lancet Medical Journal.
43440	50040	Well, I couldn't find any reports of the virus in early December 2019 in the Lancet.
50040	54640	Even Richard Horton, the Lancet's editor-in-chief, says there's no such report.
55160	59920	Please let me correct the record, he tweeted, the Lancet did not publish any report in early
59920	66560	December 2019 about a virus spreading in Wuhan. Neither could I find any other reports of
66560	72740	a possible virus published in early December, and the letter doesn't cite any. So I turned
72740	78320	to a reputable source, the Congressional Research Service, to find out what reports the White
78320	82740	House is referring to. The CRS's role is to give information to
82780	90060	members of Congress on both sides of the aisle, so it has to be strictly factual and non-partisan.
90060	95660	But they couldn't find any reports prior to December 30th either. The CRS concluded that
95660	100940	the first publicly available reports of the outbreak were on a financial news website
100940	107380	called Yikai on December 31st, Beijing time. Yikai had learned about the outbreak from
107380	113340	this in-house notice sent to hospitals by the Wuhan Municipal Health Commission. The
113340	118900	Yikai report was picked up by several other Chinese websites, including Sina, and the
118900	124460	Sina report was picked up by the Programme for Monitoring Emerging Diseases, PROMED,
124460	130940	an open source platform in the USA. They translated it into English and posted it just three hours
130940	136620	after Yikai had broken the story. A few hours after that, the PROMED story was seen by the
136620	142660	WHO in Geneva. According to the CRS, the WHO contacted the
142660	148140	Chinese authorities the same day and asked for more details, in compliance with the international
148140	154060	health regulations that govern it. So the White House claim that the WHO ignored reports
154060	159460	in early December is false, and the claim that China's media highlighted a new virus
159460	166540	emerging in Wuhan between December 26th and December 30th is also false. The first publicly
166540	173100	available reports were media stories published on December 31st, Beijing time. If the White
173100	178540	House wants to insist that it does have knowledge of reports in early December, then these reports
178540	183300	are known only to the White House, and for some reason it failed to act on the information
183300	189740	at the time or pass it on, and it's unable to cite these reports today.
189740	191620	Let's hear the next claim from a couple of vloggers.
191620	206620	On December 31st, China notified the WHO that there was an issue. Taiwan did the same
206620	211460	thing on the same day with evidence of human-to-human transmission.
211460	215820	This seems to have originated with a claim from Taiwanese health officials, which were
215820	222520	widely reported. Health officials in Taipei say they alerted the WHO at the end of December
222520	227760	about the risk of human-to-human transmission of the new virus, but said its concerns were
227760	232540	not passed on to other countries. The Wall Street Journal took the Taiwanese at their
232540	238260	word. Taiwanese officials warned WHO on December 31st that they had seen evidence that the
238260	242660	virus could be transmitted human-to-human. And of course the claim was copied in the
242660	248960	list of reasons why the USA was withdrawing from the WHO. The WHO chose not to share any
248960	253040	of this critical information with the rest of the world.
253040	257420	But no-one thought to check the email from Taiwan to see if the internet chatter was
257420	264700	true. It's publicly available because Taiwan released a copy. Dated December 31st, it said,
264700	269660	news resources today indicate that at least seven atypical pneumonia cases were reported
269660	274460	in Wuhan China. Their health authorities replied to the media that the cases were
274460	279700	believed not SARS, however the samples are still under examination and cases have been
279700	284780	isolated for treatment. I would greatly appreciate it if you have relevant information to share
284780	290580	with us. So there was no warning of human-to-human transmission.
290580	296700	And where did Taiwan get its information? No, Taiwan explicitly said that its sources
296700	303500	were news resources published on December 31st and the response of the health authorities.
303500	308700	Those are exactly the same sources and the same information that the WHO had on the same
308700	314940	day. There was no critical information that wasn't already known. The email from Taiwan
314940	320860	was simply repeating what ProMed, the WHO and everyone else monitoring China had already
320860	325700	seen, including statements from the Chinese authorities saying that patients had been
325700	332060	put into isolation, which is a standard protocol for suspected infections. In a separate statement
332060	337520	about this timeline, the Taiwanese CDC made no mention of knowing about human-to-human
337520	344100	transmission in December or warning the WHO of human-to-human transmission. They say they
344100	348380	only thought they could be human-to-human transmission when they dispatched experts
348380	353700	to Wuhan in mid-January. By the way, this again dispels the claim that
353700	359220	the Chinese media were reporting a new virus in early December. Taiwan keeps a very close
359220	364820	track of Chinese media and yet, according to the Taiwanese government, it was only alerted
364820	371820	to reports about a possible virus at the same time as the WHO on December 31st. The first
371820	376980	public indication that they had been human-to-human transmission came on January 9th when the
376980	383460	WHO reported, according to Chinese authorities, the virus in question can cause severe illness
383460	388600	in some patients and does not transmit readily between people.
388600	393520	The information prompted the WHO to issue an immediate worldwide alert, saying the route
393520	398900	of transmission was unknown but suspected to be respiratory and that specimens should
398900	404300	be regarded as potentially infectious and that health authorities should assume that
404300	409660	this was a coronavirus with the potential for respiratory spread, in other words human-to-human
409660	415500	transmission. On January 14th, the Wuhan Municipal Health Commission issued a statement
415500	420660	saying there is no clear evidence of human-to-human transmission and that was also passed on by
420660	425500	the WHO. But the WHO omitted the next two lines of
425500	431220	the statement that would have clarified that. We cannot exclude the possibility of human-to-human
431220	437640	transmission, it said, but the risk of continued human-to-human transmission is low. The Chinese
437640	442600	statement was technically correct because there's no definition of the word clear,
442600	448020	but that made it vague and even misleading because it didn't tell the whole story.
448020	453580	As early as December 27th, Dr Zhang Jixiang saw three patients suffering from atypical
453580	460120	pneumonia at her hospital in Wuhan, a father, mother and son. In an interview given months
460120	465680	later with a Chinese magazine, Dr Zhang said she thought it's unlikely that all three
465680	470640	members of a family caught the same disease at the same time unless it's an infectious
470640	474640	disease. So a more informative statement from the Chinese
474640	479340	health authorities would have been that there is some evidence of limited human-to-human
479340	485060	transmission based on the small amount of data available but no clear evidence of sustained
485060	489680	human-to-human transmission. But as well as being obliged to pass on information from
489680	496760	the health authorities in an infected country, the WHO is also free to make its own evaluation.
496760	503160	Which it did, at a news conference the same day. The WHO's Acting Head of Emerging Diseases,
503160	508400	Maria Vanka Kovar, said, from the information that we have, it is possible that there is
508400	513820	limited human-to-human transmission potentially among families, but it's very clear right
513820	518380	now that we have no sustained human-to-human transmission.
518380	523900	According to NPR and the BBC, an anonymous WHO official told their reporters that Dr
523900	530820	Kerkova had been misunderstood. Whoever that official was, he was wrong. Kerkova's statement
530820	535900	was completely accurate based on the data available and very well understood by the
535900	539420	reporters in the room. The news went around the world.
539420	545220	The new coronavirus discovered in China may have had some limited spread among humans.
545220	558780	WHO says new coronavirus could spread, warns hospitals worldwide, world on alert for potential
558780	565180	spread of new SARS-like virus found in China, and so on in Turkey, Singapore, the United
565180	570500	States and elsewhere. In its critical op-ed, the Wall Street Journal
570500	577900	wrote, on January 22nd-23rd, a WHO emergency committee debated whether to declare COVID-19
577900	583700	a public health emergency of international concern. According to the Wall Street Journal,
583700	588720	it should have been an easy decision, despite Beijing's objections. The White House letter
588720	595440	makes the same complaint, claiming that China had put pressure on the WHO. Whether or not
595440	600880	there was pressure applied to the WHO, the decision to declare a public health emergency
600880	606920	is based on the advice of the WHO's International Health Response Committee. They're all independent
606920	613680	experts from different institutes in different countries outside the WHO. They met on January
613680	620680	22nd, but couldn't reach agreement, and deliberations continued into the 23rd. But even on that
620720	626360	second day, they were still evenly split. The explanation given is that while they all
626360	631040	agreed the outbreak should merit a scale-up of awareness, there wasn't a gradation of
631040	636960	warnings that they could call. There's no one-alarm fire or two-alarm fire. It's either
636960	642320	a five-alarm fire or nothing. Declaring a public health emergency of international
642320	648420	concern is a big step because it's the highest alert the WHO can give and triggers a number
648420	653660	of actions that have to be taken by member states. At the time of their meeting, the
653660	658780	city of Wuhan had been put in lockdown, so there was hope that the virus could be contained,
658780	664500	and there were only about 100 cases of coronavirus outside of China. So the committee agreed
664500	671620	a compromise, come back in a week and review the data again. Which they did. And by that
671620	676660	time the virus was clearly not being contained and a public health emergency of international
676660	683940	concern was declared. The question is, was the length of time taken to declare the emergency
683940	690660	unduly long? The designation of a public health emergency of international concern was only
690660	695980	developed in 2005 and has been invoked six times since then.
695980	703580	So let's look at two of the largest. The 2009 H1N1 virus was first reported by the WHO on
703580	709840	March 18th. It crossed into the United States on April 15th and a public health emergency
709840	717860	of international concern was declared on April 25th. That's a gap of just over a month.
717860	725420	The 2014 Ebola virus was first reported to the WHO on March 23rd. The WHO declared the
725420	731220	epidemic a public health emergency of international concern on August 8th. So that's a gap of
731220	736540	over four months. So in terms of time, the emergency declaration for coronavirus at
736540	743780	the end of January was relatively fast. But that could be a reflection of a faster spread.
743780	749300	So next I compared the severity of the two previous largest outbreaks. At the time the
749300	755820	international health emergency was declared on April 25th 2009, there were around 2,000
755820	764980	cases and 149 deaths from H1N1 in two countries. As for the 2014 Ebola outbreak, by the end
764980	769980	of July 27th, two weeks before the public health emergency was declared, there were
769980	779060	already 1,323 cases and 729 deaths spanning three countries.
779060	783340	So the severity of the coronavirus outbreak at the time of the first meeting on January
783340	791500	23rd was nowhere near as bad as for the previous two worse pandemics. A week later it was worse,
791500	795660	which is when a public health emergency was declared.
795660	799980	By the way, a lot of people, including whoever drafted the White House letter, seemed to
799980	806300	think that the WHO declared a pandemic. It didn't. It characterised the virus as a pandemic,
806300	811700	but there wasn't any practical or legal implication to that. The highest level of alert at the
811700	818780	WHO is the public health emergency of international concern, which it had already declared.
818780	824260	Of course, the WHO described this as a pandemic weeks after it fit the WHO's own definition
824260	829460	of a pandemic. It's just that calling it a pandemic didn't change anything. If any
829460	834460	government was ignoring the public health emergency of international concern and waiting
834460	839340	for the virus to be called a pandemic, then it was either ignorant of international health
839340	843800	protocols or completely incompetent.
843800	849300	The Wall Street Journal also took issue with the WHO praising China for its efforts. According
849300	853340	to the White House letter, this is one of the reasons given for defunding and leaving
853340	855340	the WHO.
855340	860260	On January 28th, after meeting with President Xi in Beijing, he praised the Chinese government
860260	866280	for its transparency with respect to the coronavirus, announcing that China had set a new standard
866280	870360	for outbreak control and bought the world time.
870360	875820	So did China deserve such effusive praise? From a human rights perspective, many civil
875820	882020	libertarians would say no. 60 million people were confined to their homes, there was mass
882020	887840	testing, and anyone who tested positive for the virus was forced into isolation. But from
887840	894100	an epidemiological perspective, the actions China took dealt with the virus very effectively.
894100	899820	Two huge hospitals were built from scratch, and a national travel ban slowed the spread.
899820	905100	Wuhan International Airport was shut down. Within a couple of months, most restrictions
905100	910800	had been lifted. Draconian as these actions were, the Chinese government did set a standard
910800	916020	for outbreak control. As the virus spread, most Western countries followed the Chinese
916020	923780	model of a national plan, mass testing, lockdown of hotspots, and mandatory mask wearing.
923780	927880	That doesn't mean these draconian measures were a good thing or a bad thing, or that
927880	933820	containing the virus at the expense of personal liberty and the economy was justified. That's
933820	941620	a matter of opinion. But from an epidemiological perspective, it worked and was widely copied.
941620	946900	In fact, the measures in China were so effective that the WHO wasn't the only voice of praise.
946900	951300	I spoke with President Xi and they're working very, very hard and I think it's going to
951300	957380	all work out fine. He loves his country and he's doing a very good job with a very, very
957380	962460	tough situation. But the issue of transparency is another matter.
962460	967180	Several people criticised me for saying in an earlier video that China was slow in getting
967180	973260	information out and underplayed the virus in its early stages. But examples of that
973260	978780	have been shown in this video as well as my previous two. Even the mayor of Wuhan agreed
978780	984700	that information release was slow. To their credit, the time between China suspecting
984700	991060	a new virus and completely shutting down a city of 10 million people was just three weeks,
991060	996880	which by international standards is remarkably fast. But there was a delay of about a week
996880	1002740	in getting information out. There was a pattern of only making important announcements about
1002740	1008100	the virus after the news had been published in the media. The mayor of Wuhan blamed the
1008100	1013980	slow release of information on China's tightly controlled society and centralised decision
1013980	1020300	making. The WHO was well aware of this. In secret recordings obtained by the Associated
1020300	1026780	Press, officials at the WHO constantly expressed frustration at the slow pace of information
1026780	1034140	release. For example, China shared the genetic map of the virus with the WHO on January 12th,
1034140	1039340	which to give them credit was laudably fast. But according to the AP, that was more than
1039340	1044860	a week after the Chinese government labs had sequenced it, and ten days after Xi Zhengli
1044860	1050080	at the Wuhan Institute of Virology had sequenced it, according to a statement Xi made several
1050080	1056500	weeks later. None of this information was shared with the WHO. It was only when a Chinese
1056500	1061700	research consortium sequenced the virus and released its findings independent of the government
1061700	1067240	on January 9th that the Chinese authorities released theirs.
1067240	1071700	So while China might rightly deserve praise for quickly dealing with the virus, why did
1071700	1077900	the WHO praise it for transparency? According to the leaked recordings, the WHO felt that
1077900	1082840	criticising the Chinese government wouldn't be at all productive and could result in China
1082840	1088820	simply refusing to cooperate, for example by not releasing data or refusing to allow
1088820	1095020	the WHO experts into Wuhan to investigate. What the President's rationale was for praising
1095020	1102860	China's so-called transparency is a little less clear. China has been working very hard
1102860	1109460	to contain the coronavirus. The United States greatly appreciates their efforts and transparency.
1109460	1114820	It will all work out well. On January 12th, the WHO advised against the
1114820	1120980	application of international travel restrictions because of the new coronavirus. That was criticised
1120980	1126020	by many commentators and included in the White House letter giving reasons for the US withdrawal
1126020	1131020	from the WHO. You also praised China's strict domestic travel
1131020	1136420	restrictions but were inexplicably against my closing of the United States border or
1136420	1142380	the ban with respect to people coming from China. That's partly correct. The WHO lauded
1142380	1148200	domestic travel restrictions but advised against international travel restrictions.
1148200	1153340	From an epidemiological perspective, a virus can't distinguish between provincial and
1153340	1159320	international boundaries, so what works for one also works for the other.
1159320	1164780	But it wasn't inexplicable because the WHO did in fact explain the reason travel restrictions
1164780	1170700	don't stop the spread of a virus. Which is true, but they do slow it down. A study in
1170700	1175500	the journal Science found that the closure of Wuhan International Airport, for example,
1175500	1179020	cut case importations in other countries by 80%.
1179020	1184620	Up to that point, the complaint is correct. Unfortunately, the rest of the complaint needs
1184620	1190380	some fact checking. The United States border wasn't closed. Flights from China continued
1190380	1195860	because Americans living in China, Chinese residents in the USA and their families were
1195860	1200560	still allowed to travel freely. Several of those flights brought the first confirmed
1200560	1207100	coronavirus cases into the USA and international travel continued unchecked even from heavily
1207100	1213820	infected countries like Italy. In fact, nearly every country ignored the WHO's advice and
1213820	1219840	imposed travel restrictions and contrary to the White House claim, the WHO didn't criticise
1219840	1225600	the United States or any other country for taking these actions.
1225600	1229840	The White House letter complained that the WHO had downplayed the very serious risk of
1229840	1235000	asymptomatic spread, telling the world that COVID-19 does not transmit as efficiently
1235000	1240900	as influenza and that unlike influenza, this disease was not primarily driven by people
1240900	1247780	who are infected but not yet sick. Well, not quite. Let me just get the quote correct.
1247780	1252840	The director general of the WHO certainly did say COVID-19 does not transmit as efficiently
1252840	1259200	as influenza but he added, from the data we have so far. The second quote also had
1259200	1264680	the caveat that asymptomatic cases of COVID-19 did not appear to be the major drivers of
1264680	1271720	transmission. Leaving aside the misquotes, was what Tedros actually said correct? The
1271720	1277780	infectiousness of a virus is measured by the basic reproduction number or the R number.
1277780	1282420	This is an approximate figure for the average number of people each infected person will
1283000	1288340	A review paper published in mid February, more than two weeks before Tedros's speech,
1288340	1297880	found that the R number of SARS-CoV-2 in three separate studies averaged 2.44, 4.2 and 2.67.
1297880	1305080	Seasonal flu is between 0.9 and 2.1. In other words, SARS-CoV-2 is roughly twice as infectious
1305080	1311180	as seasonal flu. That evidence was available to Tedros at the time of his speech, so his
1311180	1317740	statement was incorrect. As for asymptomatic cases not seeming to be the major driver of
1317740	1323400	transmission, the fact is there was uncertainty as this research paper published just three
1323400	1328880	days after Tedros's speech shows. But there was also increasing evidence at the time of
1328880	1335600	the speech of asymptomatic cases spreading the virus. Even so, as late as June, Maria
1335600	1342140	Van Kerkhove was still saying that asymptomatic transmission was rare. The next day she corrected
1342140	1346740	her statement to explain that she was talking about a small subset of studies.
1346740	1352240	I got a few comments in an earlier video forum saying this.
1352240	1357820	What about WHO, an international body suggesting face masks don't work? Why would you follow
1357820	1362720	official medical advice when they lied about masks not working?
1362720	1368800	Well let's start as always by getting the facts straight. The WHO never said masks don't
1368800	1374180	work. Here's the earliest advice from the WHO given in January and it specifically says
1374180	1379120	that wearing a medical mask is one of the prevention measures to limit spread of certain
1379120	1386880	respiratory diseases, including 2019 ENCOV in affected areas. However, it then goes on
1386880	1391900	to explain that masks are only effective if they are properly worn, properly handled and
1391900	1396740	accompanied by other preventive measures, like hand washing.
1396740	1402140	Long before the outbreak of Covid-19, virologists had shown that masks do protect against water
1402140	1407700	droplets that carry the virus and even smaller particles called aerosols if the mask is a
1407700	1414220	type N95. The effectiveness in preventing the virus getting through in one study was
1414220	1420800	68% and 91% respectively. But viruses can also be spread by touching
1420800	1426880	contaminated surfaces or droplets getting into the eyes. So the effectiveness of masks
1426880	1432840	depends on proper hygiene. One Hong Kong study found that masks alone had little effect in
1432840	1439800	reducing the spread of influenza in a group that wore masks but didn't wash their hands.
1439800	1444640	Masks are even more effective in preventing infected people from spreading the virus.
1444640	1449940	This test shows droplets, they're visible in green, emanating from someone just talking
1449940	1462020	without a mask. But wearing a mask stops that completely.
1462020	1466740	So right from the start of the outbreak the WHO recommended the use of masks for people
1466740	1471980	with symptoms and healthcare workers because they do work. They didn't recommend it for
1471980	1477780	the general population at that time because the supply of masks was limited. That was
1477780	1484200	the same advice given by the CDC and the UK's Chief Medical Advisor for the same reasons.
1484200	1490920	As more masks became available and the asymptomatic spread of SARS-CoV-2 was discovered, the advice
1490920	1496620	changed. The claim that masks don't work isn't coming from the WHO, it's coming from people
1496620	1503480	who distrust or even ignore medical advice. If I hadn't been wearing a mask so much in
1503480	1510740	the last 10 days or so, I really wonder if I would have gotten it. But I know moving
1510740	1518280	the mask around, getting it just right, I'm bound to put some virus on the mask that I
1518280	1523280	sucked in. That's most likely what happened. With respect, sir, if your hand hygiene is
1523280	1528120	so bad that you think you're spreading the virus onto your mask by touching it, then
1528120	1533200	it's your filthy hands that are the cause of the problem, not the mask. Masks shouldn't
1533240	1537820	need constant adjustment anyway. So why are you... Oh, well, if you're going to dress
1537820	1542480	up like Jesse James, then it's not surprising you have to keep fiddling with this ridiculous
1542480	1548000	handkerchief tied round the back of your neck. If you want to know how a mask should be worn
1548000	1552040	and how to wash your hands, the WHO has a helpful guide.
1552040	1558640	Place the mask on your face, covering your nose, mouth and chin, making sure there are
1558640	1561720	no gaps between your face and the mask.
1561720	1566260	Not that, Jesse James. But obviously, no advice on how to wear a mask is going to be
1566260	1569880	effective if you willfully want to infect other people.
1569880	1576880	You spent $53, writes this lady. No mask. Only one in the store maskless. No one said
1576880	1580720	a word. Be brave. Try it. You'll like it.
1580720	1584580	Well, good for you if you think you're being brave by going into a supermarket without
1584580	1589520	a mask. But unless you're following hand washing protocols, the mask isn't so much to protect
1589520	1595360	you, but to protect other people from you if you're carrying the virus. It's a bit like
1595360	1600320	driving at 80 miles an hour through a busy school zone. You may think you're being brave
1600320	1605200	by risking your life at such high speeds, but in reality, you're more likely to kill
1605200	1610640	someone else. The problem is that in many parts of the United States, this isn't seen
1610640	1617880	as a medical issue, but a political one. Both of these people are members of Congress.
1617880	1619520	Can you take it up because I cannot hear you?
1619520	1620600	I'll just speak louder, sir.
1620600	1622680	Oh, OK. You want to be politically correct.
1622680	1628560	Why masks are effective and under what circumstances is not a matter of political correctness,
1628560	1634320	but scientific correctness. I don't know whether the person in this video is a fascist, a communist,
1634320	1640800	a Democrat or a Republican. Viruses work the same way for everyone. This gets us away from
1640800	1645580	the point that these complaints about the WHO are factually incorrect. But I thought
1645580	1651020	it was important not only to explain the WHO's true position on masks, but also why
1651020	1658100	and how mask wearing is effective, regardless of your political persuasion.
1658100	1662880	I've already looked at the false claim that Taiwan warned the WHO about human-to-human
1662880	1668500	transmission back in December. The criticism that the WHO doesn't have a normal relationship
1668500	1674180	with Taiwan is perfectly true. It doesn't. It can't even acknowledge the existence
1674180	1678060	of Taiwan as a country, leading to this embarrassing exchange.
1678060	1682500	Would the WHO consider Taiwan's membership?
1682500	1688060	At first, Dr Aylward pretended not to hear the question. Then he disconnected the link.
1688060	1693020	And when the interview resumed, he asked the interviewer to move on. It prompted these
1693020	1699100	comments in a YouTube forum. It's proof that the WHO has been bought by China or that Dr
1699580	1704740	Aylward is taking money for his stance, or that this is all some kind of conspiracy.
1704740	1710260	Actually, the reason Dr Aylward can't answer that question is fairly well known, and it's
1710260	1715960	been the subject of discussion for the last 40 years. It's not the WHO that gets to decide
1715960	1720620	whether Taiwan should be a member. It's up to member countries, including the United
1720620	1726380	States. The reason the WHO doesn't have a normal relationship with Taiwan is because
1726380	1731860	the United States and other nations, including Taiwan itself, have ruled that Taiwan as a
1731860	1738860	country doesn't exist. It's a province of China. So by international law, UN agencies,
1739340	1742820	including the WHO, aren't allowed to officially deal with it.
1742820	1748780	OK, I know we use the terms China and Taiwan as shorthand, but even Taiwan doesn't officially
1748780	1754940	call itself Taiwan. By mutual agreement and under international law, there's only one
1754940	1760180	country, but it has two rival claimants. There's the Republic of China with its government
1760180	1766860	in Taipei, and the People's Republic of China with its government in Beijing. Both agree
1766860	1772460	that Taiwan is just a province of their country. Several years ago I came face to face with
1772460	1777840	this bizarre situation personified when I met the Governor of Taiwan at a Kuomintang
1777840	1783460	Convention in Taipei. I asked him exactly what he does every day, and the short answer
1783500	1790140	is not much. Because there's only one country, every nation has to decide which of the two
1790140	1795580	governments to recognise. And since nearly every country, including the United States,
1795580	1801660	those churned in red, have now opted to recognise Beijing, it's the People's Republic of China
1801660	1807420	that occupies China's seat at the United Nations. That's why the USA doesn't have an official
1807420	1813300	embassy in Taiwan. It's represented by something called the American Institute. It's why
1813300	1818860	members of the WHO, including the United States when it was a member, have given China's seat
1818860	1825540	at the WHO to the People's Republic of China, not the Republic of China. It means the People's
1825540	1831900	Republic of China gets to decide on what terms the province of Taiwan participates in international
1831900	1838700	gatherings. The WHO can and does have regular unofficial contacts with Taiwan, but it can't
1838700	1844340	be officially recognised. Taiwan can't even compete in the Olympics or attend international
1844340	1850380	conferences or join international organisations like APEC under the name of Republic of China.
1850380	1858340	It has to participate as something called Chinese Taipei. I know, how dare I call Taiwan a province
1858340	1864500	of China? Well until Taiwan declares independence, which it shows no sign of doing because the
1864500	1870340	consequences would be far too bloody, both Taipei and Beijing do regard it as a province
1870340	1876260	of China, so you can't blame Dr Elwood either. He's lumbered with a system imposed on him
1876260	1881640	by the two Chinas and by members of the United Nations, including the United States, which
1881640	1888060	chose to recognise Beijing rather than Taipei. If critics want the WHO and other UN bodies
1888060	1893420	to give Taiwan official recognition, then they need to lobby the US government to switch
1893420	1898820	recognition from the People's Republic of China to the Republic of China and then get
1898820	1905960	a majority of UN members to do likewise. Perhaps having a normal relationship in a very abnormal
1905960	1911660	situation is more complicated than the op-ed writers of the Wall Street Journal and casual
1911660	1917980	posters on a YouTube video forum assume. It's a shame that the real shortcomings of the
1917980	1923980	WHO have been buried under an avalanche of false information, fabrications, misquotes
1923980	1929020	and misrepresentations, exemplified by the White House letter that seems to have been
1929020	1934980	based on internet myths compiled from blogs. Most of the factually based complaints against
1934980	1943420	the WHO come from within the scientific community. For example, in July 239 scientists openly
1943420	1951040	criticised the WHO for not recognising the potential of SARS-CoV-2 spread through aerosols,
1951040	1956840	in other words micro-droplets less than 5 micrometres in diameter. Some of the signatories
1956840	1962980	told the New York Times, the Infection Prevention and Control Committee in particular is bound
1962980	1968780	by a rigid and overly medicalised view of the scientific evidence, is slow and risk-averse
1968780	1975240	in updating its guidance and allows a few conservative voices to shout down dissent.
1975240	1979780	Another example, although this is just my opinion and therefore carries as much weight
1979780	1986080	as an empty thought bubble, the WHO's long-standing travel advice might have been fine for SARS
1986080	1992260	and MERS and even valid in the early stages of the novel coronavirus, but it wasn't appropriate
1992260	1997200	by February and should have been changed, especially since part of the rationale was
1997200	2005100	to prevent business disruption and adverse economic effects. That's not the WHO's job.
2005100	2010360	And while the WHO was perfectly right and obliged to pass on the information it received
2010360	2017000	from China, the message it gave was messy and uncoordinated. Its alert to hospitals
2017000	2022260	on January 5th was clear and concise and should have also gone out in a media release at the
2022260	2027860	same time. It wasn't reported by the media until nine days later when it was mentioned
2027860	2033580	at a news conference. The WHO should also have reported the January 14th statements
2033580	2038780	from the Chinese health authorities in full and Van Gogh-Kover's analysis should have
2038780	2044280	been included, not just given at the news conference. Fortunately, the media picked
2044280	2050540	up on the significance of what she said and made it their lead story. Why so many people
2050540	2055460	didn't know that the WHO had warned of the danger of human-to-human transmission on January
2055460	2061460	14th or alerted hospitals as far back as January 5th could be because they have their heads
2061460	2065300	buried in the blogs instead of simply listening to the evening news.
2065300	2069380	You may have had some limited spread among humans. That's the latest from the World Health
2069380	2075060	Organisation. When I investigated the WHO's stance on asymptomatic transmissibility and
2075060	2079920	the reproduction rate, I was surprised to find at least two papers with a high number
2079920	2086160	of citations that the WHO had apparently overlooked. These problems may be the result
2086160	2092620	of the WHO's bureaucratic protocols, but that's fixable. None of the world's health authorities
2092620	2098420	or even the scientists who are sometimes critical of the WHO advocates defunding it because
2098420	2103280	the work it does in monitoring disease and improving the health of millions of people
2103280	2109000	is invaluable. And that's especially true in the middle of a pandemic.
2109000	2114520	If the US administration is concerned about the increasing influence of China at the WHO,
2114520	2120000	then it should have done what China did and taken active role in the organisation. Instead,
2120000	2125880	the US seat on the executive board was left unfilled for three long years. It was only
2125880	2131040	in March this year that the President finally appointed a US representative to fill the
2131040	2137820	seat, just a few weeks before its withdrawal. And ironically, by withdrawing from the WHO,
2137820	2142840	the United States is now ensuring the very outcome it wants to prevent. The US withdrawal
2142840	2148800	is leaving the field wide open to China. I realise that by presenting facts in this video
2148800	2154440	I'm up against human nature. People tend to believe the first thing they read or hear,
2154440	2159200	and with so much disinformation on the internet, it's then very hard for them to change their
2159200	2164280	minds – even when presented with the facts in black and white, which they can read for
2164280	2165880	themselves.
2165880	2171120	So before you comment with the usual unsupported cries of, this is all bullshit, take a look
2171120	2176280	again at the facts, and by all means check them. If you want to maintain that Taiwan
2176280	2181280	warned about human-to-human transmission, or that the Lancet or anyone else published
2181280	2187080	an article about the virus in early December, or that the WHO said somewhere that masks
2187080	2193440	don't work, by all means cite these articles and documents and let everyone read them.
2193440	2197400	Don't just point to a blog that tells you these things happened and expect everyone
2197400	2202020	else to share your faith. And if you think it's wrong that Taiwan isn't allowed to
2202020	2208180	fully participate in United Nations organisations, and I wholeheartedly agree, then instead of
2208180	2214240	blaming the WHO for a situation not of its making, tell us your solution. Should the
2214240	2219440	Taiwanese government drop the One China policy and declare independence? Should the United
2219440	2225280	States switch recognition from Beijing to Taipei? Let's see what workable ideas you
2225280	2227060	come up with.
2227060	2231740	If you think the WHO shouldn't have to flatter countries in order to gain access to crucial
2231740	2237900	medical information, let's hear your solution. Should the WHO be given powers to subpoena
2237900	2243180	doctors and medical records from a country? Should it have the power to forcibly send
2243180	2248280	in health specialists even if the host country doesn't want them there? And what should
2248280	2253980	be the consequences if the target country refuses? Bomb them? I'm really looking forward
2253980	2259580	to your solutions rather than just the usual mindless criticism.
