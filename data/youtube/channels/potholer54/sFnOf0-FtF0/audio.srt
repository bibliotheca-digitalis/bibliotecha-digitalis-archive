00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,520
This is just a quickie video that I want to get out before a major earthquake happens on March 21st.

2
00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:09,760
Are you serious? Are we talking mega, mega, mega-quake?

3
00:00:09,760 --> 00:00:14,560
Are we talking about something that might literally crack the earth apart?

4
00:00:14,560 --> 00:00:15,120
Wha-

5
00:00:15,120 --> 00:00:18,720
No, don't go running for the emergency evacuation kit just yet.

6
00:00:18,720 --> 00:00:21,120
This was prompted by an email I got saying,

7
00:00:21,120 --> 00:00:25,280
I'm curious about all the news and stories stating that the earth is shifting its axis

8
00:00:25,280 --> 00:00:29,840
at approximately every 188 days, causing an earthquake with each event.

9
00:00:30,560 --> 00:00:33,680
I'd never heard of this, but the email ended with the question,

10
00:00:33,680 --> 00:00:37,360
do you know about any research documents that may prove this phenomenon?

11
00:00:38,160 --> 00:00:43,840
But I wasn't about to go through all the journals searching for papers about a 188 day axis shift,

12
00:00:43,840 --> 00:00:47,280
and then do another search for papers showing there's no such thing.

13
00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:51,360
There's a much easier way, which of course is, go to the source.

14
00:00:52,320 --> 00:00:55,920
So we have to track down where this assertion comes from.

15
00:00:55,920 --> 00:01:00,320
When I googled earthquakes 188 days, a number of sites came up.

16
00:01:00,320 --> 00:01:01,760
I picked this one.

17
00:01:01,760 --> 00:01:06,160
And this led me to this site, which was an interview with the guy who made the assertion.

18
00:01:06,160 --> 00:01:08,880
It told me that this myth is based on a DVD.

19
00:01:09,440 --> 00:01:12,560
And that led me to this site, which is a trailer for the DVD.

20
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:18,080
And that led me to this site, which is run by the guy who came up with the idea, Wayne Young.

21
00:01:18,080 --> 00:01:20,720
He goes by the name Lucas 911.

22
00:01:20,720 --> 00:01:23,280
At his website, you can buy copies of the DVD.

23
00:01:24,240 --> 00:01:29,600
So we've now established that this theory about the Earth shifting on its axis every 188 days

24
00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:33,440
is not based on any scientific study that's been peer reviewed

25
00:01:33,440 --> 00:01:35,760
and written up in a respected scientific journal.

26
00:01:36,480 --> 00:01:40,400
It's just an idea that some guy has come up with and put on his website,

27
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:43,040
and it only took a few clicks of the mouse to find this.

28
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:48,240
It's all based on the claim that major earthquakes happen every 188 days.

29
00:01:48,960 --> 00:01:52,320
Now, if they did, and if that pattern was statistically significant,

30
00:01:52,320 --> 00:01:57,120
that would certainly be interesting, and some explanation would have to be forthcoming.

31
00:01:57,120 --> 00:02:02,080
But before we get into explanations that involve exploding comets or hidden planets,

32
00:02:02,080 --> 00:02:06,240
let's just see if there really is a 188 day pattern.

33
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:10,400
Well, the interviewer here certainly seems to think there's a pattern.

34
00:02:10,960 --> 00:02:16,960
And it appears that earthquakes are occurring for this segment, as you say.

35
00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:23,520
You have... No, I came 188, 187, 189.

36
00:02:24,720 --> 00:02:25,220
You're right.

37
00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:29,840
But one of the cardinal rules in science is that you can't cherry-pick

38
00:02:29,840 --> 00:02:32,720
only the data that conforms to your hypothesis.

39
00:02:32,720 --> 00:02:35,920
You can certainly discard data that you know to be erroneous,

40
00:02:35,920 --> 00:02:39,760
and there's a statistical method for discarding data at the extremes,

41
00:02:39,760 --> 00:02:42,480
but reliable data has to be included.

42
00:02:43,040 --> 00:02:46,320
And if that messes up your nice, neat little hypothesis,

43
00:02:46,320 --> 00:02:50,000
then tough! It means the hypothesis was probably wrong.

44
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:55,120
So the first question to ask is whether Young has included all the earthquake data,

45
00:02:55,120 --> 00:02:57,360
and the answer is no, he hasn't.

46
00:02:58,960 --> 00:03:03,600
Here are all the earthquakes of magnitude 7 or greater in the time period he's looking at.

47
00:03:04,160 --> 00:03:08,080
Even if we only take the earthquakes around the so-called Ring of Fire,

48
00:03:08,080 --> 00:03:10,880
which is where Young's chosen earthquakes are located,

49
00:03:10,880 --> 00:03:15,280
there are more than enough to completely stuff up the 188 day cycle.

50
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:21,360
And the earthquakes aren't just random in time, there's no clear pattern in geography either,

51
00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:23,920
except for the very well-understood geological premise

52
00:03:23,920 --> 00:03:27,360
that earthquakes concentrate along the margins of tectonic plates.

53
00:03:28,320 --> 00:03:32,400
When I investigated further, I found a number of videos from last year

54
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:37,600
insisting that there was a geographical, as well as a temporal, link between these earthquakes.

55
00:03:37,600 --> 00:03:42,480
Well, here's the deal. You've got Chile, 188 days later,

56
00:03:42,480 --> 00:03:46,800
New Zealand, 188 days later, the big earthquake in Japan,

57
00:03:46,800 --> 00:03:54,400
and 188 days later will be right here on September the 15th.

58
00:03:54,960 --> 00:04:03,360
8.9. Now we get another earthquake in California on the 15th of September. Will that be?

59
00:04:03,920 --> 00:04:07,280
Of course, there was no earthquake in Northern California,

60
00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:11,600
but as soon as that myth fizzled out, it was replaced by the myth we now have,

61
00:04:11,600 --> 00:04:15,200
because luckily for the 188 day cycle believers,

62
00:04:15,200 --> 00:04:19,680
an earthquake occurred near Fiji on the day it was supposed to hit California.

63
00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:24,000
What are the odds? Well, actually, pretty good, as we'll see in a minute.

64
00:04:24,640 --> 00:04:27,520
But first, let's look at the alleged cycle itself.

65
00:04:28,480 --> 00:04:32,960
Now, statistically speaking, it wouldn't be difficult to find a pattern somewhere in here

66
00:04:32,960 --> 00:04:37,200
if you only picked the time intervals that fit and discarded those that didn't.

67
00:04:37,200 --> 00:04:43,520
If you have 43 points in time like this, then you have a total of just under 1,000 time intervals.

68
00:04:43,520 --> 00:04:47,120
Hardly surprising that three of them are going to be more or less the same.

69
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:49,360
If you want to make your own conspiracy theory,

70
00:04:49,360 --> 00:04:53,360
see if you can find three other time intervals that match, or even four.

71
00:04:54,480 --> 00:04:56,960
Here's a website that will do the calculations for you.

72
00:04:57,920 --> 00:05:03,360
If you can go one earthquake better than the 188 day theory and find four time intervals,

73
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:06,160
then make a DVD and make lots of money.

74
00:05:07,520 --> 00:05:10,400
Who knows, you might even strike lucky and get another earthquake

75
00:05:10,400 --> 00:05:13,440
on the day your earthquake cycle comes round again.

76
00:05:13,440 --> 00:05:15,680
The chances of this are pretty good.

77
00:05:15,680 --> 00:05:21,440
Based on his 188 day cycle, Young predicts another major earthquake on March 21st.

78
00:05:22,080 --> 00:05:27,360
For the time period he covered, a major earthquake occurs on average every 19 days,

79
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:30,880
so there's a better than even chance that a major earthquake will occur

80
00:05:30,880 --> 00:05:33,760
five days either side of the 188 day mark.

81
00:05:34,320 --> 00:05:41,680
And since 188 days can also mean 189 days or 187 days according to the hypothesis,

82
00:05:41,680 --> 00:05:44,720
the odds are pretty good that Young will get his earthquake.

83
00:05:45,280 --> 00:05:48,480
Perhaps the statisticians among you can work out the odds.

84
00:05:48,480 --> 00:05:51,040
If he's wrong, what has he got to lose?

85
00:05:51,040 --> 00:05:56,000
If he's right, the believers will hail him as a prophet and buy more of his DVDs.

86
00:05:57,120 --> 00:06:02,160
But eventually, of course, this hypothesis will fizzle out as the cycle fails to unfold,

87
00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:05,600
because there is no cycle, just an unscientific cherry pick.

88
00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:07,840
Why do people believe it?

89
00:06:07,840 --> 00:06:08,800
I don't know.

90
00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:12,880
It's just our natural disposition to believe what we're told by our peers,

91
00:06:12,880 --> 00:06:16,880
to look for patterns that aren't there, and these days to distrust scientists

92
00:06:16,880 --> 00:06:20,480
whom many people think are determined to keep these truths from us.

93
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:26,560
As an understanding of our world continues to unfold in the pages of scientific journals,

94
00:06:26,560 --> 00:06:30,800
we seem determined to push ourselves back into the scientific dark ages.

95
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:36,720
Is God revealed to us a code, an earthquake code?

96
00:06:37,680 --> 00:06:40,880
The 188 day cycle is real.
