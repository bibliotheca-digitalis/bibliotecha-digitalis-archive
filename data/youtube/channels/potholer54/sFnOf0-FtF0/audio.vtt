00:00.000 --> 00:05.520
This is just a quickie video that I want to get out before a major earthquake happens on March 21st.

00:05.520 --> 00:09.760
Are you serious? Are we talking mega, mega, mega-quake?

00:09.760 --> 00:14.560
Are we talking about something that might literally crack the earth apart?

00:14.560 --> 00:15.120
Wha-

00:15.120 --> 00:18.720
No, don't go running for the emergency evacuation kit just yet.

00:18.720 --> 00:21.120
This was prompted by an email I got saying,

00:21.120 --> 00:25.280
I'm curious about all the news and stories stating that the earth is shifting its axis

00:25.280 --> 00:29.840
at approximately every 188 days, causing an earthquake with each event.

00:30.560 --> 00:33.680
I'd never heard of this, but the email ended with the question,

00:33.680 --> 00:37.360
do you know about any research documents that may prove this phenomenon?

00:38.160 --> 00:43.840
But I wasn't about to go through all the journals searching for papers about a 188 day axis shift,

00:43.840 --> 00:47.280
and then do another search for papers showing there's no such thing.

00:47.280 --> 00:51.360
There's a much easier way, which of course is, go to the source.

00:52.320 --> 00:55.920
So we have to track down where this assertion comes from.

00:55.920 --> 01:00.320
When I googled earthquakes 188 days, a number of sites came up.

01:00.320 --> 01:01.760
I picked this one.

01:01.760 --> 01:06.160
And this led me to this site, which was an interview with the guy who made the assertion.

01:06.160 --> 01:08.880
It told me that this myth is based on a DVD.

01:09.440 --> 01:12.560
And that led me to this site, which is a trailer for the DVD.

01:13.200 --> 01:18.080
And that led me to this site, which is run by the guy who came up with the idea, Wayne Young.

01:18.080 --> 01:20.720
He goes by the name Lucas 911.

01:20.720 --> 01:23.280
At his website, you can buy copies of the DVD.

01:24.240 --> 01:29.600
So we've now established that this theory about the Earth shifting on its axis every 188 days

01:29.600 --> 01:33.440
is not based on any scientific study that's been peer reviewed

01:33.440 --> 01:35.760
and written up in a respected scientific journal.

01:36.480 --> 01:40.400
It's just an idea that some guy has come up with and put on his website,

01:40.400 --> 01:43.040
and it only took a few clicks of the mouse to find this.

01:43.680 --> 01:48.240
It's all based on the claim that major earthquakes happen every 188 days.

01:48.960 --> 01:52.320
Now, if they did, and if that pattern was statistically significant,

01:52.320 --> 01:57.120
that would certainly be interesting, and some explanation would have to be forthcoming.

01:57.120 --> 02:02.080
But before we get into explanations that involve exploding comets or hidden planets,

02:02.080 --> 02:06.240
let's just see if there really is a 188 day pattern.

02:07.200 --> 02:10.400
Well, the interviewer here certainly seems to think there's a pattern.

02:10.960 --> 02:16.960
And it appears that earthquakes are occurring for this segment, as you say.

02:17.680 --> 02:23.520
You have... No, I came 188, 187, 189.

02:24.720 --> 02:25.220
You're right.

02:25.920 --> 02:29.840
But one of the cardinal rules in science is that you can't cherry-pick

02:29.840 --> 02:32.720
only the data that conforms to your hypothesis.

02:32.720 --> 02:35.920
You can certainly discard data that you know to be erroneous,

02:35.920 --> 02:39.760
and there's a statistical method for discarding data at the extremes,

02:39.760 --> 02:42.480
but reliable data has to be included.

02:43.040 --> 02:46.320
And if that messes up your nice, neat little hypothesis,

02:46.320 --> 02:50.000
then tough! It means the hypothesis was probably wrong.

02:50.800 --> 02:55.120
So the first question to ask is whether Young has included all the earthquake data,

02:55.120 --> 02:57.360
and the answer is no, he hasn't.

02:58.960 --> 03:03.600
Here are all the earthquakes of magnitude 7 or greater in the time period he's looking at.

03:04.160 --> 03:08.080
Even if we only take the earthquakes around the so-called Ring of Fire,

03:08.080 --> 03:10.880
which is where Young's chosen earthquakes are located,

03:10.880 --> 03:15.280
there are more than enough to completely stuff up the 188 day cycle.

03:16.000 --> 03:21.360
And the earthquakes aren't just random in time, there's no clear pattern in geography either,

03:21.360 --> 03:23.920
except for the very well-understood geological premise

03:23.920 --> 03:27.360
that earthquakes concentrate along the margins of tectonic plates.

03:28.320 --> 03:32.400
When I investigated further, I found a number of videos from last year

03:32.400 --> 03:37.600
insisting that there was a geographical, as well as a temporal, link between these earthquakes.

03:37.600 --> 03:42.480
Well, here's the deal. You've got Chile, 188 days later,

03:42.480 --> 03:46.800
New Zealand, 188 days later, the big earthquake in Japan,

03:46.800 --> 03:54.400
and 188 days later will be right here on September the 15th.

03:54.960 --> 04:03.360
8.9. Now we get another earthquake in California on the 15th of September. Will that be?

04:03.920 --> 04:07.280
Of course, there was no earthquake in Northern California,

04:07.280 --> 04:11.600
but as soon as that myth fizzled out, it was replaced by the myth we now have,

04:11.600 --> 04:15.200
because luckily for the 188 day cycle believers,

04:15.200 --> 04:19.680
an earthquake occurred near Fiji on the day it was supposed to hit California.

04:19.680 --> 04:24.000
What are the odds? Well, actually, pretty good, as we'll see in a minute.

04:24.640 --> 04:27.520
But first, let's look at the alleged cycle itself.

04:28.480 --> 04:32.960
Now, statistically speaking, it wouldn't be difficult to find a pattern somewhere in here

04:32.960 --> 04:37.200
if you only picked the time intervals that fit and discarded those that didn't.

04:37.200 --> 04:43.520
If you have 43 points in time like this, then you have a total of just under 1,000 time intervals.

04:43.520 --> 04:47.120
Hardly surprising that three of them are going to be more or less the same.

04:47.120 --> 04:49.360
If you want to make your own conspiracy theory,

04:49.360 --> 04:53.360
see if you can find three other time intervals that match, or even four.

04:54.480 --> 04:56.960
Here's a website that will do the calculations for you.

04:57.920 --> 05:03.360
If you can go one earthquake better than the 188 day theory and find four time intervals,

05:03.360 --> 05:06.160
then make a DVD and make lots of money.

05:07.520 --> 05:10.400
Who knows, you might even strike lucky and get another earthquake

05:10.400 --> 05:13.440
on the day your earthquake cycle comes round again.

05:13.440 --> 05:15.680
The chances of this are pretty good.

05:15.680 --> 05:21.440
Based on his 188 day cycle, Young predicts another major earthquake on March 21st.

05:22.080 --> 05:27.360
For the time period he covered, a major earthquake occurs on average every 19 days,

05:27.360 --> 05:30.880
so there's a better than even chance that a major earthquake will occur

05:30.880 --> 05:33.760
five days either side of the 188 day mark.

05:34.320 --> 05:41.680
And since 188 days can also mean 189 days or 187 days according to the hypothesis,

05:41.680 --> 05:44.720
the odds are pretty good that Young will get his earthquake.

05:45.280 --> 05:48.480
Perhaps the statisticians among you can work out the odds.

05:48.480 --> 05:51.040
If he's wrong, what has he got to lose?

05:51.040 --> 05:56.000
If he's right, the believers will hail him as a prophet and buy more of his DVDs.

05:57.120 --> 06:02.160
But eventually, of course, this hypothesis will fizzle out as the cycle fails to unfold,

06:02.160 --> 06:05.600
because there is no cycle, just an unscientific cherry pick.

06:06.240 --> 06:07.840
Why do people believe it?

06:07.840 --> 06:08.800
I don't know.

06:08.800 --> 06:12.880
It's just our natural disposition to believe what we're told by our peers,

06:12.880 --> 06:16.880
to look for patterns that aren't there, and these days to distrust scientists

06:16.880 --> 06:20.480
whom many people think are determined to keep these truths from us.

06:21.360 --> 06:26.560
As an understanding of our world continues to unfold in the pages of scientific journals,

06:26.560 --> 06:30.800
we seem determined to push ourselves back into the scientific dark ages.

06:30.800 --> 06:36.720
Is God revealed to us a code, an earthquake code?

06:37.680 --> 06:40.880
The 188 day cycle is real.
