0	5520	This is just a quickie video that I want to get out before a major earthquake happens on March 21st.
5520	9760	Are you serious? Are we talking mega, mega, mega-quake?
9760	14560	Are we talking about something that might literally crack the earth apart?
14560	15120	Wha-
15120	18720	No, don't go running for the emergency evacuation kit just yet.
18720	21120	This was prompted by an email I got saying,
21120	25280	I'm curious about all the news and stories stating that the earth is shifting its axis
25280	29840	at approximately every 188 days, causing an earthquake with each event.
30560	33680	I'd never heard of this, but the email ended with the question,
33680	37360	do you know about any research documents that may prove this phenomenon?
38160	43840	But I wasn't about to go through all the journals searching for papers about a 188 day axis shift,
43840	47280	and then do another search for papers showing there's no such thing.
47280	51360	There's a much easier way, which of course is, go to the source.
52320	55920	So we have to track down where this assertion comes from.
55920	60320	When I googled earthquakes 188 days, a number of sites came up.
60320	61760	I picked this one.
61760	66160	And this led me to this site, which was an interview with the guy who made the assertion.
66160	68880	It told me that this myth is based on a DVD.
69440	72560	And that led me to this site, which is a trailer for the DVD.
73200	78080	And that led me to this site, which is run by the guy who came up with the idea, Wayne Young.
78080	80720	He goes by the name Lucas 911.
80720	83280	At his website, you can buy copies of the DVD.
84240	89600	So we've now established that this theory about the Earth shifting on its axis every 188 days
89600	93440	is not based on any scientific study that's been peer reviewed
93440	95760	and written up in a respected scientific journal.
96480	100400	It's just an idea that some guy has come up with and put on his website,
100400	103040	and it only took a few clicks of the mouse to find this.
103680	108240	It's all based on the claim that major earthquakes happen every 188 days.
108960	112320	Now, if they did, and if that pattern was statistically significant,
112320	117120	that would certainly be interesting, and some explanation would have to be forthcoming.
117120	122080	But before we get into explanations that involve exploding comets or hidden planets,
122080	126240	let's just see if there really is a 188 day pattern.
127200	130400	Well, the interviewer here certainly seems to think there's a pattern.
130960	136960	And it appears that earthquakes are occurring for this segment, as you say.
137680	143520	You have... No, I came 188, 187, 189.
144720	145220	You're right.
145920	149840	But one of the cardinal rules in science is that you can't cherry-pick
149840	152720	only the data that conforms to your hypothesis.
152720	155920	You can certainly discard data that you know to be erroneous,
155920	159760	and there's a statistical method for discarding data at the extremes,
159760	162480	but reliable data has to be included.
163040	166320	And if that messes up your nice, neat little hypothesis,
166320	170000	then tough! It means the hypothesis was probably wrong.
170800	175120	So the first question to ask is whether Young has included all the earthquake data,
175120	177360	and the answer is no, he hasn't.
178960	183600	Here are all the earthquakes of magnitude 7 or greater in the time period he's looking at.
184160	188080	Even if we only take the earthquakes around the so-called Ring of Fire,
188080	190880	which is where Young's chosen earthquakes are located,
190880	195280	there are more than enough to completely stuff up the 188 day cycle.
196000	201360	And the earthquakes aren't just random in time, there's no clear pattern in geography either,
201360	203920	except for the very well-understood geological premise
203920	207360	that earthquakes concentrate along the margins of tectonic plates.
208320	212400	When I investigated further, I found a number of videos from last year
212400	217600	insisting that there was a geographical, as well as a temporal, link between these earthquakes.
217600	222480	Well, here's the deal. You've got Chile, 188 days later,
222480	226800	New Zealand, 188 days later, the big earthquake in Japan,
226800	234400	and 188 days later will be right here on September the 15th.
234960	243360	8.9. Now we get another earthquake in California on the 15th of September. Will that be?
243920	247280	Of course, there was no earthquake in Northern California,
247280	251600	but as soon as that myth fizzled out, it was replaced by the myth we now have,
251600	255200	because luckily for the 188 day cycle believers,
255200	259680	an earthquake occurred near Fiji on the day it was supposed to hit California.
259680	264000	What are the odds? Well, actually, pretty good, as we'll see in a minute.
264640	267520	But first, let's look at the alleged cycle itself.
268480	272960	Now, statistically speaking, it wouldn't be difficult to find a pattern somewhere in here
272960	277200	if you only picked the time intervals that fit and discarded those that didn't.
277200	283520	If you have 43 points in time like this, then you have a total of just under 1,000 time intervals.
283520	287120	Hardly surprising that three of them are going to be more or less the same.
287120	289360	If you want to make your own conspiracy theory,
289360	293360	see if you can find three other time intervals that match, or even four.
294480	296960	Here's a website that will do the calculations for you.
297920	303360	If you can go one earthquake better than the 188 day theory and find four time intervals,
303360	306160	then make a DVD and make lots of money.
307520	310400	Who knows, you might even strike lucky and get another earthquake
310400	313440	on the day your earthquake cycle comes round again.
313440	315680	The chances of this are pretty good.
315680	321440	Based on his 188 day cycle, Young predicts another major earthquake on March 21st.
322080	327360	For the time period he covered, a major earthquake occurs on average every 19 days,
327360	330880	so there's a better than even chance that a major earthquake will occur
330880	333760	five days either side of the 188 day mark.
334320	341680	And since 188 days can also mean 189 days or 187 days according to the hypothesis,
341680	344720	the odds are pretty good that Young will get his earthquake.
345280	348480	Perhaps the statisticians among you can work out the odds.
348480	351040	If he's wrong, what has he got to lose?
351040	356000	If he's right, the believers will hail him as a prophet and buy more of his DVDs.
357120	362160	But eventually, of course, this hypothesis will fizzle out as the cycle fails to unfold,
362160	365600	because there is no cycle, just an unscientific cherry pick.
366240	367840	Why do people believe it?
367840	368800	I don't know.
368800	372880	It's just our natural disposition to believe what we're told by our peers,
372880	376880	to look for patterns that aren't there, and these days to distrust scientists
376880	380480	whom many people think are determined to keep these truths from us.
381360	386560	As an understanding of our world continues to unfold in the pages of scientific journals,
386560	390800	we seem determined to push ourselves back into the scientific dark ages.
390800	396720	Is God revealed to us a code, an earthquake code?
397680	400880	The 188 day cycle is real.
