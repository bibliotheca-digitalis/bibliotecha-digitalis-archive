0	4180	Popular creation speaker Eric Hovind and I were top contenders for an award on
4300	8820	YouTube given out by, as Eric called them, the atheist, agnostic, anti-Christ,
8940	13820	God-hating YouTubers. This award is given out to those creationists they deemed to
13940	18380	have broken the 9th commandment. I find it highly ironic that they would call upon
18500	22180	the laws of a God whom they contend does not even exist.
22300	26220	Well, Eric Hovind apparently beat me up by a few votes, and YouTuber Potholer54,
26240	30200	who organizes the awards, once again has criticized and accused out of his own
30320	31360	sheer ignorance.
31480	36280	Well, Ian Juby's partly right. I'm ignorant about so many things, which is why I
36400	40560	always try to bridge the gap of my ignorance by checking the claims made by
40680	45760	nominees for the coveted Golden Crocoduck. So when Juby claimed two different nests
45880	50960	of eggs were made by an oviraptor, I checked Juby's own source and found that
51080	55880	he got it wrong. Which means his entire case that the oviraptor was running away
55940	60300	from a flood is based on a breach of the 9th commandment, and that's what got him
60420	65380	landed with the Golden Crocoduck nomination two years ago. And last year he got
65500	69740	nominated for claiming that the sun could have orbited the earth, and then the two
69860	75020	got out of balance and switched places. Once again, it's not my ignorance that
75140	79780	tells me this is nonsense. It comes from checking the laws of planetary motion that
79900	85700	have been established for 400 years, and that even most other creationists accept.
85760	89760	As for why the award is given for the biggest breach of the 9th commandment, which
89880	95120	atheists like me don't believe in, well, that's easy. First, I do believe in not
95240	99880	bearing false witness unless telling the truth would needlessly hurt someone. I
100000	104520	just don't need all the religious baggage that goes with it. Secondly, the Golden
104640	108160	Crocoduck is awarded for the biggest breach of the 9th commandment in pursuit
108280	113560	of the creationist cause, precisely because it is a creationist commandment.
113620	116900	It wouldn't be much good giving creationists an award for breaching a
117020	121940	Buddhist commandment, or an ancient Persian one, or even an atheist commandment, if we
122060	127340	had any. So let's see who's guilty this year of breaching laws that they're
127460	131460	supposed to follow. What do you have to do from an engineering point of view to
131580	133260	change the cow into a whale?
133260	146280	Abiogenesis is the idea that life can form from non-living material, which is also
146400	149840	called spontaneous generation, which was proven wrong over 200 years ago.
163260	174460	Maybe the Vela Pulsar got wind somehow innately of Psalm 148, verse 3, and says,
174580	177700	praise Him, sun and moon, and all you shining stars. We're a shining star. We
177820	181820	should praise Him. Well, how are we going to praise Him? I know. Let's oscillate 11
181940	187420	times a second on our axis and see if we can send a radio signal into the universe
187420	193980	that would join in the symphony of God's praise from all creation.
247420	252260	This dark mulch should be 10, 20, 30 feet thick.
277420	282580	Let's see if we can get a radio signal into the universe that would join in the
282700	285060	symphony of God's praise from all creation.
307420	312580	Let's see if we can get a radio signal into the universe that would join in the
312700	315060	symphony of God's praise from all creation.
