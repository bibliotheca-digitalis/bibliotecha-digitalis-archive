1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,180
Popular creation speaker Eric Hovind and I were top contenders for an award on

2
00:00:04,300 --> 00:00:08,820
YouTube given out by, as Eric called them, the atheist, agnostic, anti-Christ,

3
00:00:08,940 --> 00:00:13,820
God-hating YouTubers. This award is given out to those creationists they deemed to

4
00:00:13,940 --> 00:00:18,380
have broken the 9th commandment. I find it highly ironic that they would call upon

5
00:00:18,500 --> 00:00:22,180
the laws of a God whom they contend does not even exist.

6
00:00:22,300 --> 00:00:26,220
Well, Eric Hovind apparently beat me up by a few votes, and YouTuber Potholer54,

7
00:00:26,240 --> 00:00:30,200
who organizes the awards, once again has criticized and accused out of his own

8
00:00:30,320 --> 00:00:31,360
sheer ignorance.

9
00:00:31,480 --> 00:00:36,280
Well, Ian Juby's partly right. I'm ignorant about so many things, which is why I

10
00:00:36,400 --> 00:00:40,560
always try to bridge the gap of my ignorance by checking the claims made by

11
00:00:40,680 --> 00:00:45,760
nominees for the coveted Golden Crocoduck. So when Juby claimed two different nests

12
00:00:45,880 --> 00:00:50,960
of eggs were made by an oviraptor, I checked Juby's own source and found that

13
00:00:51,080 --> 00:00:55,880
he got it wrong. Which means his entire case that the oviraptor was running away

14
00:00:55,940 --> 00:01:00,300
from a flood is based on a breach of the 9th commandment, and that's what got him

15
00:01:00,420 --> 00:01:05,380
landed with the Golden Crocoduck nomination two years ago. And last year he got

16
00:01:05,500 --> 00:01:09,740
nominated for claiming that the sun could have orbited the earth, and then the two

17
00:01:09,860 --> 00:01:15,020
got out of balance and switched places. Once again, it's not my ignorance that

18
00:01:15,140 --> 00:01:19,780
tells me this is nonsense. It comes from checking the laws of planetary motion that

19
00:01:19,900 --> 00:01:25,700
have been established for 400 years, and that even most other creationists accept.

20
00:01:25,760 --> 00:01:29,760
As for why the award is given for the biggest breach of the 9th commandment, which

21
00:01:29,880 --> 00:01:35,120
atheists like me don't believe in, well, that's easy. First, I do believe in not

22
00:01:35,240 --> 00:01:39,880
bearing false witness unless telling the truth would needlessly hurt someone. I

23
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:44,520
just don't need all the religious baggage that goes with it. Secondly, the Golden

24
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:48,160
Crocoduck is awarded for the biggest breach of the 9th commandment in pursuit

25
00:01:48,280 --> 00:01:53,560
of the creationist cause, precisely because it is a creationist commandment.

26
00:01:53,620 --> 00:01:56,900
It wouldn't be much good giving creationists an award for breaching a

27
00:01:57,020 --> 00:02:01,940
Buddhist commandment, or an ancient Persian one, or even an atheist commandment, if we

28
00:02:02,060 --> 00:02:07,340
had any. So let's see who's guilty this year of breaching laws that they're

29
00:02:07,460 --> 00:02:11,460
supposed to follow. What do you have to do from an engineering point of view to

30
00:02:11,580 --> 00:02:13,260
change the cow into a whale?

31
00:02:13,260 --> 00:02:26,280
Abiogenesis is the idea that life can form from non-living material, which is also

32
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:29,840
called spontaneous generation, which was proven wrong over 200 years ago.

33
00:02:43,260 --> 00:02:54,460
Maybe the Vela Pulsar got wind somehow innately of Psalm 148, verse 3, and says,

34
00:02:54,580 --> 00:02:57,700
praise Him, sun and moon, and all you shining stars. We're a shining star. We

35
00:02:57,820 --> 00:03:01,820
should praise Him. Well, how are we going to praise Him? I know. Let's oscillate 11

36
00:03:01,940 --> 00:03:07,420
times a second on our axis and see if we can send a radio signal into the universe

37
00:03:07,420 --> 00:03:13,980
that would join in the symphony of God's praise from all creation.

38
00:04:07,420 --> 00:04:12,260
This dark mulch should be 10, 20, 30 feet thick.

39
00:04:37,420 --> 00:04:42,580
Let's see if we can get a radio signal into the universe that would join in the

40
00:04:42,700 --> 00:04:45,060
symphony of God's praise from all creation.

41
00:05:07,420 --> 00:05:12,580
Let's see if we can get a radio signal into the universe that would join in the

42
00:05:12,700 --> 00:05:15,060
symphony of God's praise from all creation.
