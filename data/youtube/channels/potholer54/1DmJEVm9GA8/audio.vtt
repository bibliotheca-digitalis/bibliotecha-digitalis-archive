00:00.000 --> 00:04.180
Popular creation speaker Eric Hovind and I were top contenders for an award on

00:04.300 --> 00:08.820
YouTube given out by, as Eric called them, the atheist, agnostic, anti-Christ,

00:08.940 --> 00:13.820
God-hating YouTubers. This award is given out to those creationists they deemed to

00:13.940 --> 00:18.380
have broken the 9th commandment. I find it highly ironic that they would call upon

00:18.500 --> 00:22.180
the laws of a God whom they contend does not even exist.

00:22.300 --> 00:26.220
Well, Eric Hovind apparently beat me up by a few votes, and YouTuber Potholer54,

00:26.240 --> 00:30.200
who organizes the awards, once again has criticized and accused out of his own

00:30.320 --> 00:31.360
sheer ignorance.

00:31.480 --> 00:36.280
Well, Ian Juby's partly right. I'm ignorant about so many things, which is why I

00:36.400 --> 00:40.560
always try to bridge the gap of my ignorance by checking the claims made by

00:40.680 --> 00:45.760
nominees for the coveted Golden Crocoduck. So when Juby claimed two different nests

00:45.880 --> 00:50.960
of eggs were made by an oviraptor, I checked Juby's own source and found that

00:51.080 --> 00:55.880
he got it wrong. Which means his entire case that the oviraptor was running away

00:55.940 --> 01:00.300
from a flood is based on a breach of the 9th commandment, and that's what got him

01:00.420 --> 01:05.380
landed with the Golden Crocoduck nomination two years ago. And last year he got

01:05.500 --> 01:09.740
nominated for claiming that the sun could have orbited the earth, and then the two

01:09.860 --> 01:15.020
got out of balance and switched places. Once again, it's not my ignorance that

01:15.140 --> 01:19.780
tells me this is nonsense. It comes from checking the laws of planetary motion that

01:19.900 --> 01:25.700
have been established for 400 years, and that even most other creationists accept.

01:25.760 --> 01:29.760
As for why the award is given for the biggest breach of the 9th commandment, which

01:29.880 --> 01:35.120
atheists like me don't believe in, well, that's easy. First, I do believe in not

01:35.240 --> 01:39.880
bearing false witness unless telling the truth would needlessly hurt someone. I

01:40.000 --> 01:44.520
just don't need all the religious baggage that goes with it. Secondly, the Golden

01:44.640 --> 01:48.160
Crocoduck is awarded for the biggest breach of the 9th commandment in pursuit

01:48.280 --> 01:53.560
of the creationist cause, precisely because it is a creationist commandment.

01:53.620 --> 01:56.900
It wouldn't be much good giving creationists an award for breaching a

01:57.020 --> 02:01.940
Buddhist commandment, or an ancient Persian one, or even an atheist commandment, if we

02:02.060 --> 02:07.340
had any. So let's see who's guilty this year of breaching laws that they're

02:07.460 --> 02:11.460
supposed to follow. What do you have to do from an engineering point of view to

02:11.580 --> 02:13.260
change the cow into a whale?

02:13.260 --> 02:26.280
Abiogenesis is the idea that life can form from non-living material, which is also

02:26.400 --> 02:29.840
called spontaneous generation, which was proven wrong over 200 years ago.

02:43.260 --> 02:54.460
Maybe the Vela Pulsar got wind somehow innately of Psalm 148, verse 3, and says,

02:54.580 --> 02:57.700
praise Him, sun and moon, and all you shining stars. We're a shining star. We

02:57.820 --> 03:01.820
should praise Him. Well, how are we going to praise Him? I know. Let's oscillate 11

03:01.940 --> 03:07.420
times a second on our axis and see if we can send a radio signal into the universe

03:07.420 --> 03:13.980
that would join in the symphony of God's praise from all creation.

04:07.420 --> 04:12.260
This dark mulch should be 10, 20, 30 feet thick.

04:37.420 --> 04:42.580
Let's see if we can get a radio signal into the universe that would join in the

04:42.700 --> 04:45.060
symphony of God's praise from all creation.

05:07.420 --> 05:12.580
Let's see if we can get a radio signal into the universe that would join in the

05:12.700 --> 05:15.060
symphony of God's praise from all creation.
