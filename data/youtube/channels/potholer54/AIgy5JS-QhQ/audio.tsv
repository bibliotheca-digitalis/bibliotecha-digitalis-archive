0	8000	About 400 years ago, Galileo set up an experiment to test his hypothesis that objects accelerate as they fall.
8000	13000	It was an extraordinary act. Arab intellectuals had been doing the same thing for centuries,
13000	20000	but while their science was widely accepted and admired in Europe, their methods of experimentation were looked down on.
20000	28000	The Christian Church maintained that conclusions could only be reached by discussion and logic, as had been taught by Aristotle.
28000	38000	Galileo's simple experiment changed all that and began a revolution that led us away from medieval superstitions and beliefs into what's known as the Enlightenment.
38000	46000	Science is simply knowledge. What we really mean when we talk about science is the method by which that knowledge is derived.
46000	54000	Over hundreds of years, the golden rules of science have been honed and perfected to ensure meticulous accuracy and impartiality,
54000	58000	and they start with something that was anathema to the medieval church.
58000	68000	Evidence, in its most basic form, is an observation, so this rule means that a conclusion has to be based on observations.
68000	74000	This isn't only the basis of the scientific method, it's the basis of our entire legal system.
74000	84000	No court of law starts with a conclusion that a suspect is guilty or innocent, then passes sentence, and then later hears the evidence to confirm the infallibility of its verdict.
84000	92000	The other ground rules for scientific research may sound equally obvious. See how many of them are also applied in courts of law.
104000	120000	All scientific research has to follow these golden rules, and if the rules aren't followed, then it's not science.
120000	130000	This isn't an impediment to open-minded research any more than the rules of the courtroom are an impediment to justice, or the rules of a football game are an impediment to fair play.
130000	135000	On the contrary, they ensure impartiality and a fair and accurate result.
135000	142000	So if we all agree that these rules are fair, then let's go on to the next step, which I'll call the scientific procedure.
142000	150000	Let's follow a budding young scientist called Jane. She reads research reports and data about a mysterious natural phenomenon.
150000	156000	Suddenly she gets a hunch as to its nature. In scientific parlance, she has a hypothesis.
156000	164000	To see if her hypothesis is right, Jane makes a prediction about what should happen with this natural phenomenon under certain circumstances.
164000	177000	Now comes her first hurdle. For three years, Jane has to perform experiments, take measurements, and collect data as she tests her hypothesis, all the time meticulously following the golden rules of the scientific method.
177000	185000	When the research project is over, Jane might discover that her prediction is wrong and have to change the hypothesis and start all over again.
185000	191000	But if the prediction is correct, she writes up her results in a paper and submits it to a scientific journal.
191000	198000	Then she meets the second hurdle. Experts in the same field pull the paper apart, looking for any mistakes.
198000	205000	If she's followed the scientific method meticulously and got her calculations right, the paper is published.
205000	213000	The final hurdle comes when other researchers try to replicate Jane's experiments. They'll make sure there's no other explanation for her results.
213000	220000	One of these researchers might even take Jane's experiment further and discover not only what happens, but why.
220000	226000	There's a lot of misunderstanding about replication, and it's often used as an argument against evolution.
226000	233000	But science is a deduction based on evidence, not the recreation of past events in a laboratory.
233000	242000	Prosecutors don't have to replicate a murder to show that a murder took place. A bound and gagged corpse with multiple stab wounds is usually enough.
242000	251000	The replication of results means that if Jane bases her conclusions on an experiment, then that experiment has to be repeatable by other researchers.
251000	256000	If she bases it on something she's observed, they have to be able to observe it too.
256000	264000	If she claims to have rubbed an oil lamp and seen a genie rising out of it, then her result will be invalid if other researchers can't do the same.
264000	272000	It's no use Jane explaining that the genie will only come out again a thousand years from now. There's simply no way of falsifying that claim.
272000	276000	A hypothesis has to be falsifiable, or it can't be tested.
276000	283000	Only after these hurdles have been successfully overcome will Jane's hypothesis become Jane's theory.
283000	291000	There's also a lot of misunderstanding about the word theory. We can never say Jane's proved something, however solid her evidence.
291000	302000	Proof is a mathematical term. A theory is an explanation that's consistent with all the observable evidence, and every new piece of evidence has to be consistent with the theory.
302000	310000	The theory has to be consistent with new theories in other fields, and of course new technologies based on the theory have to work.
310000	318000	As long as no other theories even remotely match this consistency, Jane's theory is a fact and can be added to school textbooks.
318000	328000	But that doesn't mean it can't be modified. Even pillars of science like the theory of gravity and the theory of evolution have been modified as new evidence comes along.
328000	334000	But these modifications don't overturn the theories, they just show more precisely how they work.
334000	339000	Let's look at this through a branch of science that everyone can understand, cartography.
340000	349000	In the 15th century, gaps in European knowledge of what lay beyond the oceans were always filled with fanciful myths of sea dragons and monsters.
349000	357000	After land was discovered, some geographers hypothesized that this might be a new continent. Of course, these early explorers made mistakes.
357000	363000	In the early days of any field of science, the evidence is sparse and technology is inaccurate.
363000	370000	But as the amount of evidence increases and measurements become more precise, we move towards increasing certainty.
370000	377000	Just because there are some errors doesn't mean we have to scrap our continent theory and go back to believing in sea dragons and monsters.
377000	383000	On the contrary, each correction makes us more certain about the shape and character of the continent.
383000	390000	So the scientific method doesn't guarantee that mistakes won't be made, but it does guarantee they'll be corrected.
391000	397000	Let's say Jane has an evil twin brother, John, who has a hypothesis in a different field of science.
397000	401000	Unlike Jane, John's sloppy and his data is faulty.
401000	407000	If that's the case, it's unlikely he'll get past the second hurdle of peer review and his paper would be rejected.
407000	412000	So let's say he fakes his results to make it seem as though his hypothesis was correct.
412000	417000	Based on his fake data, John's fraudulent paper is published.
417000	421000	There you go, proof that the scientific method doesn't work.
421000	428000	But then other researchers can't replicate his results. New evidence isn't consistent with John's hypothesis.
428000	434000	Over time, the hypothesis doesn't fit and John's fake results become a puzzling anomaly.
434000	437000	Increasingly, they're marginalized and ignored.
437000	443000	Then a different hypothesis is suggested by another researcher and that is successfully tested.
443000	447000	That does fit all the evidence and it leads to technology that works.
447000	452000	Whether other researchers think John cheated or just got things wrong doesn't matter.
452000	460000	Over time, bad science will always be found out because it won't be consistent. It'll be impossible to make it fit.
460000	463000	So the scientific procedure is a kind of screening process.
463000	471000	It ensures that whatever children learn in science class has been thoroughly tested, verified and supported by evidence.
471000	474000	It also has one compelling virtue. It works.
474000	484000	All of the technology around you, from your computer screen to the plastic in your chair to the vitamin tablets you might be taking, owe their existence to the scientific method.
489000	495000	That's like saying scientists presuppose relativity or electromagnetism or radioactive decay.
495000	499000	None of these concepts was known before it was discovered.
502000	506000	Science doesn't start with an assumption that something's natural or supernatural.
506000	511000	It starts with something that happens and then works out how and why it happens.
511000	515000	In the past, people thought fairy rings were a supernatural phenomenon.
515000	519000	Now we know they're caused by the subterranean spread of fungus.
519000	527000	Science is an explanation based on impartial research backed by rigorous checks and balances, not belief.
527000	532000	That was me speaking a few years ago, when I first posted this video.
532000	539000	It was taken down because of copyright infringement and I promised I'd re-upload it when I got home from six months on the road.
539000	545000	Now that I'm home, I'll also work on some of my other videos that got spiked because of music problems.
545000	553000	Since I made that video, several people have pointed out that a hypothesis is not necessarily something that turns into a theory.
553000	557000	And I agree that part of the explanation was a little simplistic.
557000	568000	You could, for example, say that the hypothesis of continental drift, which is supported by similar rock types and fossils on different continents, turned into the theory of plate tectonics.
568000	580000	But you could also argue that that only happened because on top of the evidence for continental drift, plate tectonic theory was supported by a number of other successfully tested hypotheses such as seafloor spreading.
580000	589000	But the main point to understand is that a hypothesis and a theory are different, and the word theory should not be cheapened by applying it to ideas.
589000	597000	In science, a theory is and has to remain the highest form of proof you can get in science, short of a mathematical law.
597000	606000	Don't forget, in lieu of a Patreon account, I really appreciate any donations to a charity that's resulting in better health and less deforestation.
606000	608000	Links are in the video description.
608000	615000	The last I heard, they had received over 4,000 US dollars from my subscribers. A big thank you to all.
