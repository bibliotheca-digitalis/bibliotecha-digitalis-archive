0	3000	Children shouldn't be using cell phones, period.
3000	7000	I mean, there's enough studies out there that point out the possible adverse health effects to children
7000	17000	that any parent who loves his or her son or daughter would not in any way expose them to the use of a cell phone.
17000	20000	But we need to let the public know about these studies.
20000	24000	When I was compiling my list of dumb ideas politicians have about science,
24000	28000	I came across what I thought at first was a worthy contender.
28000	33000	Dennis Kucinich and his claim that cell phones cause brain cancer.
33000	38000	Well, as you've noticed, he didn't actually make that claim, which is why he didn't make the list.
38000	45000	But was he being alarmist in calling for an investigation and telling people to keep their kids away from cell phones?
45000	50000	Just how dangerous are cell phones and how exactly do they give you brain cancer, Doctor?
50000	52000	It's essentially cooking the brain.
52000	56000	So my cell phone is cooking my brain, essentially.
56000	62000	Which is rather odd because normally when you cook brains you have to heat them up to the point where the proteins break down.
62000	66000	But OK, how does my tiny cell phone manage to do this?
66000	67000	Over to you, Doctor.
67000	74000	Well, if you hold a phone directly to your head, you're basically microwaving the head because that's the same signal strength.
74000	81000	Well, if it's basically the same signal strength as a microwave oven, then yes, it must be basically cooking my brain.
81000	83000	Because that's what microwaves do.
83000	92000	They energise water molecules and heat up anything that contains water, like brains or eggs, and they keep heating it until eventually.
94000	98000	So never mind whether my cell phone will give me a tumour in ten years' time.
98000	103000	If a cell phone signal has the same strength as a microwave oven and it's cooking my brain,
103000	110000	then I've got more immediate problems to deal with, like having my brain turned into an omelette after just ten minutes on the phone.
111000	116000	But of course it doesn't turn into an omelette, so there must be something wrong with this cooking the brain idea.
116000	119000	And it's pretty obvious what it is.
119000	121000	That's the same signal strength.
121000	123000	No, it's not the same strength as a microwave.
123000	130000	That should be obvious just by checking the capacity of your mobile phone battery. Mine's only 10.5 watt-hours.
130000	139000	If this tiny battery did have enough capacity to power a microwave oven for several hours, then we'd have the answer to the energy storage problem.
139000	149000	The average mobile phone is giving out about 0.75 to 1 watt of power. That compares to over 700 watts for most microwave ovens.
149000	156000	In other words, microwave ovens are around a thousand times more powerful than a mobile phone.
156000	162000	So while a microwave oven is powerful enough to bring the temperature of food up to 100 degrees and cook it,
162000	168000	the best cell phone radiation can do is warm your brain by a fraction of a degree.
168000	171000	And a bit of warming never hurt anyone.
171000	174000	This is something that happens every time you put on a hat.
174000	183000	When the brain's temperature does rise by a fraction of a degree when you put on a hat, blood circulation cools it down again and keeps the brain at an even temperature.
183000	190000	So instead of saying warming, which wouldn't worry anyone, this doctor prefers to use the word heating.
190000	195000	And see if you can spot how quickly he goes from heating to cooking.
195000	203000	Vibrating the water molecules in your brain and it could potentially be heating, cooking the brain over time.
203000	206000	So let's look at the science rather than the hype.
206000	210000	First of all, there are two types of electromagnetic radiation.
210000	215000	There's ionising radiation, like ultraviolet, that can give you melanomas and skin cancer,
215000	220000	and X-rays and gamma rays, these types of shortwave radiation break molecules apart.
220000	225000	So there's no doubt that radiation at this end of the spectrum is dangerous.
225000	231000	But at the other end of the spectrum, that's where we find longer wave radiations like microwaves.
231000	235000	They don't break molecules apart, they just give them energy.
235000	238000	In other words, warm them up as we've seen.
238000	242000	So there's no physical reason why mobile phones should cause cancer,
242000	246000	and the claim that they cook your brain is hyperbolic nonsense.
246000	252000	But since millions of people use them, we have to be sure. We need studies.
252000	254000	And that's where there's a problem.
254000	259000	Because you can't strap thousands of people to bench tops and bombard them with electromagnetic radiation
259000	265000	and keep them away from all other variables for the next 20 years to see what the effect is.
265000	272000	That's why of all the different types of research, medical research on humans is the one most fraught with problems.
272000	277000	So medical researchers have to see what the effect is on animals or tissue samples,
277000	280000	or they have to look at large samples of people living normal lives
280000	286000	and see if they can spot statistical anomalies that might suggest A causes B.
286000	289000	What you can't do is what Russia Today did.
289000	295000	Find one person who has a brain tumour and jump to the conclusion that he got the tumour because he used a cell phone.
295000	299000	Alan suffered serious memory loss after years of using a mobile.
299000	304000	But Alan probably suffered memory loss after years of wearing a necktie.
304000	311000	If we're going to draw medical conclusions from random anecdotal cases, then we can make up any conclusion we like.
311000	314000	John got a toe infection after years of eating beef sandwiches.
314000	318000	Mary suffered lockjaw after years of drinking orange juice.
318000	322000	Michael lost the will to live after years of watching Adam Sandler movies.
322000	325000	OK, maybe there's something in that last one.
325000	328000	But what we need, RT, are proper studies.
328000	333000	Independent scientists, meanwhile, overwhelmingly find the most serious problems,
333000	341000	from DNA damage, three times lower sperm counts, 290% more brain tumours, autism and birth defects.
341000	345000	Autism? I thought conspiracy theorists say that's caused by vaccines.
346000	349000	But anyway, is there any science to back all that up?
349000	352000	As always, we have to check Russia Today's sources.
352000	355000	And unfortunately, they don't give any.
355000	359000	Just saying something like, the University of Washington, isn't enough.
359000	363000	We need to know the title of the paper and the date of publication.
363000	369000	But my guess is that RT is referring to this 1995 paper by Lai and Singh,
369000	374000	which comes from the University of Washington and has been cited a number of times as evidence for a link.
374000	378000	And this falls into one category of research, research on animals.
378000	386000	The researchers found that just a two-hour exposure to low-level microwave radiation caused breaks in DNA in rats,
386000	391000	and they cited other research that found breaks in DNA can be carcinogenic.
391000	399000	The problem is that research is over 20 years old, and nearly all the other studies on animals find no effect.
399000	404000	In vitro experiments, that's working on tissue samples, haven't fared any better.
404000	410000	According to a 2011 paper in the Journal of the National Cancer Institute in the USA,
410000	416000	there have been negative findings from virtually all experimental animal and in vitro studies.
416000	419000	The National Cancer Institute itself concludes,
419000	427000	in animal studies, cell phone use has not been found to cause cancer or to enhance the cancer-causing effect of known chemical carcinogens.
429000	435000	Then an animal study burst onto the scene in 2016 that changed everything.
435000	440000	A major US government study on rats finds a link between cell phones and cancer,
440000	445000	an explosive development in the long-running debate over the health effects of mobile phones.
445000	448000	The study was called game-changing, according to Mother Jones.
448000	454000	The Wall Street Journal, the Daily Mail and other media were convinced that a link had now been found.
454000	456000	Natural news went even further.
456000	463000	Decades of denials and attacks by the media, which called people concerned about cell phone radiation tinfoil hat-wearing conspiracy theorists.
463000	470000	A massive multi-year study funded by the federal government now concludes that, yes, cell phone radiation causes brain cancer!
477000	479000	But what did the study actually show?
479000	485000	Well, it showed that tinfoil hat-wearing conspiracy theorists don't know how to read a scientific paper.
485000	494000	They put mice and rats into these specially designed chambers where they could expose them at different intervals of RF energy,
494000	496000	which is the kind of energy that comes off of cell phones.
496000	500000	The results were only released from the rat portion of the study.
500000	502000	We don't know what the impacts were on the mice.
502000	504000	But they were in these chambers.
504000	513000	They were exposed in on-off intervals of 10 minutes on, 10 minutes off for 18 hours a day for a total of 9 hours of exposure a day for about 2 years.
513000	517000	So the same level of cell phone radiation that a human would be exposed.
517000	522000	No, 9 hours a day, 7 days a week is a lot more than most cell phone users are exposed to.
522000	526000	But anyway, let's look at the study itself rather than the media hype.
526000	530000	The study wasn't published in a respected peer-reviewed journal.
530000	532000	It was posted online.
532000	534000	So it hadn't been adjusted for peer review.
534000	542000	The only way you can find out what the peer reviewers thought is to scroll right down to the end of the paper where their conclusions are tacked on.
542000	544000	And they're very revealing.
544000	551000	Several reviewers pointed out that the tumours were mostly found in the male rats, but not the female rats.
551000	557000	So the study could just as easily have concluded that it's safe for women to use cell phones, but not men.
557000	566000	And even in the male rats, one reviewer concludes that there's better evidence for carcinogenic effects in the heart rather than the brain.
566000	571000	Another pointed out that the rate of tumour in the control group was far lower than normal.
571000	577000	The inference is that it may not be the male rats subjected to RF radiation that are getting more tumours than normal.
577000	581000	It's more likely that the control group are getting fewer.
581000	589000	One bizarre result of the study was that the rats that were exposed to microwave radiation lived longer than those that weren't.
589000	596000	In short, this study was neither game-changing, nor did it definitively show that mobile phones are linked to cancer.
596000	604000	It's interesting that in reporting a possible link, the conclusions become more assured the further down the news feeding chain you go.
604000	609000	Respected scientific magazines like New Scientist and Science urged caution.
609000	613000	Most news media put a possibly or a maybe in with the link.
613000	618000	But when we get down to the tabloids, the Daily Mail assumed this was a certainty.
619000	629000	And when you get to the bottom feeders, the bloggers, they not only saw this as absolute proof, they also saw it as a slap in the face for all those who weren't on board the conspiracy train.
629000	638000	This is rigorous science, said Natural News, and it shows a clear dose-related causative link between exposure to cell phone radiation and the development of brain and heart tumours.
638000	644000	For decades the government has actively conspired with industry to downplay any evidence linking cell phones to cancer.
644000	650000	The entire federal government as it operates today is little more than the science propaganda and marketing arm of private industry.
654000	663000	You know, Natural News might have more credibility if it hired a health correspondent with some training in this field, rather than what's called a health ranger.
663000	672000	And his reporting might benefit from actually reading the study, rather than simply grabbing quotes from other media outlets that got the story wrong.
672000	677000	OK, so animal studies didn't show any clear evidence that mobile phones cause cancer.
677000	682000	But there is another way to find out. Do what's called a case control study.
682000	693000	Look at a sample group of people who already have brain tumours and see how many use mobile phones, and compare that with a representative group of people who don't have brain tumours.
693000	698000	There are quite a few important studies. It's a bit of a mixed bag, but let me try to summarise.
698000	701000	The figures, by the way, don't include controls.
701000	711000	A 2008 study of 352 adolescents with brain tumours found no significant difference in brain tumours between those who used cell phones and those who didn't.
711000	721000	A 2011 study of 6420 people with different types of brain tumours also found no increased risk due to cell phone use.
721000	727000	Only among very heavy cell phone users did the researchers conclude there was a possible risk of glioma.
727000	742000	But this was inconclusive. A 2014 study of 1500 patients did find an increased risk of two types of tumour, glioma and acoustic neuroma, for people who use cell phones for more than 30 minutes a day over 10 years.
742000	751000	A 2013 study of 447 people found no link with brain tumours for average cell phone users, but it did find a link with the heaviest users.
752000	762000	So the studies of existing brain cancer patients don't find an association with ordinary cell phone use, but some suggest there may be an association with heavy cell phone use.
762000	774000	And finally, there's one more way of determining if there's a link, and that's to see if brain tumour rates have increased in the phone-using population since mobile phones came into popular use in the mid 1990s.
774000	782000	Well, they haven't, at least according to the research. In Japan, researchers looked at 7000 people in their 20s and 30s.
782000	793000	If mobile phone use did cause brain cancer, then the older participants should have a higher rate of cancer than the younger ones, because they would have used mobile phones over a longer period of time.
794000	802000	In women, there was a slight increase, and in men the association was the opposite. Neither was statistically significant.
802000	807000	And there didn't seem to be an association between brain cancer and heavy use.
807000	821000	Same with a 2016 study in Australia, and a 2011 Danish cohort study of 420,000 people, although that study has been criticised for excluding business people who would be among the heaviest mobile phone users.
822000	836000	In the United States, brain cancer rates have even been in decline since cell phones came into popular use, and although they've increased in the United Kingdom over the last 30 years, most of that increase occurred before mobile phones became popular.
836000	839000	And since then, they've been more or less flat.
839000	851000	Of course, it's possible that it takes more than 20 years for any cancer to manifest itself, but epidemiologists would expect at least some cases to start showing up before then, and nothing's showing up so far.
851000	863000	So the research is fairly clear using three separate methods. There is a possibility that heavy phone use might cause cancer, but most of the evidence shows no such link to any kind of phone use.
863000	869000	That's why nearly every major organisation involved in this field says there's no evidence of a link.
869000	891000	The US Food and Drug Administration, the Federal Communications Commission, the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences, US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the European Commission's Scientific Committee on Emerging and Newly Identified Health Risks, or Exkennihir to give it its short name, all say studies have failed to show a link between cell phones and cancer.
891000	896000	But most do suggest that further research is needed, just to be sure.
896000	905000	Only one relevant body has put cell phones on its list of possible carcinogens, and that's the United Nations International Agency for Research on Cancer.
905000	913000	It's part of the World Health Organization. But it's more a precautionary stance than the result of any definitive study.
913000	918000	But that didn't stop the media hype when the IARC classification was announced.
918000	924000	According to the WHO, dialing your cell phone could be like punching in a cook time and holding a microwave to your head.
924000	927000	No, that's not what the WHO said at all.
927000	929000	It's vibrating the water molecules in your brain.
929000	930000	Not again.
930000	933000	Independent scientists, meanwhile, overwhelmingly find the most serious problems.
933000	940000	Yet, researchers are not overwhelmingly finding problems. They're overwhelmingly finding no problems.
940000	954000	What Russia Today has done is what the media always do when they go on a crusade, which is to cherry-pick only those studies that show a possible link, turn that into a definite link, and then ignore the overwhelming majority of studies that show no link at all.
954000	962000	And, of course, quote one or two scientists who support the crusade, and ignore the majority of researchers whose conclusions don't fit.
962000	965000	We've seen a few examples, but here's another one.
965000	969000	In 2016, there were headlines in The Times and The Daily Mirror.
969000	975000	Men who keep mobile phones in their trouser pockets risk their sperm being cooked, worrying, researchers claimed.
975000	979000	But even in the story itself, there's a clue that this claim may be nonsense.
979000	987000	The Daily Mirror tells us that only 106 people were tested, which is not likely to give a statistically significant result.
987000	992000	And when you read the paper itself, sure enough, it doesn't reflect the media's bold claims.
992000	995000	Even the title of the paper should be a clue.
995000	1000000	Habits of cell phone use and sperm quality. Does it warrant attention?
1000000	1005000	Even the authors aren't suggesting that their results show a link between mobile phones and low sperm count,
1005000	1012000	only that it's an area that should be investigated with a proper study of more than just 106 people.
1013000	1018000	The bottom line is that there may possibly be a link between cancer and heavy cell phone use,
1018000	1024000	but the fact is that there's no known mechanism for such a link, and most studies don't show any such link.
1024000	1029000	So by all means let researchers keep studying the problem, but let's stop swallowing all the media hype
1029000	1033000	and the blogosphere bullshit and follow the science.
1033000	1036000	If you're worried, then use an earpiece.
1036000	1039000	That freaks me out because I don't want cancer.
1039000	1043000	To get all that, it's important to note that mobile phones are dangerous,
1043000	1047000	and numerous peer-reviewed studies have shown that they can kill you.
1047000	1050000	No, they're not going to cook your brain or bake your sperm.
1050000	1058000	These are studies that show people have been killed and seriously injured by using their mobile phones while driving.
1058000	1067000	In the UK, the Department of Transport says that in 2012, distraction due to mobile phones caused 17 deaths in car crashes.
1067000	1075000	The National Safety Council in the USA reports that cell phones were involved in 350 fatal car crashes in 2011.
1075000	1081000	Yet if you believe the blogosphere, we seem to be more worried about a phony danger than a real one.
1081000	1088000	Now be honest, before you watch this video, how many of you were a little concerned that your cell phone might give you brain cancer?
1088000	1092000	And how many of you have talked on the phone or texted while driving?
1092000	1096000	To be honest, before I check the facts, me too.
1096000	1099000	We are a strange species.
