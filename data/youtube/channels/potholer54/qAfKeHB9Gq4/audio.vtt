00:00.000 --> 00:03.000
Children shouldn't be using cell phones, period.

00:03.000 --> 00:07.000
I mean, there's enough studies out there that point out the possible adverse health effects to children

00:07.000 --> 00:17.000
that any parent who loves his or her son or daughter would not in any way expose them to the use of a cell phone.

00:17.000 --> 00:20.000
But we need to let the public know about these studies.

00:20.000 --> 00:24.000
When I was compiling my list of dumb ideas politicians have about science,

00:24.000 --> 00:28.000
I came across what I thought at first was a worthy contender.

00:28.000 --> 00:33.000
Dennis Kucinich and his claim that cell phones cause brain cancer.

00:33.000 --> 00:38.000
Well, as you've noticed, he didn't actually make that claim, which is why he didn't make the list.

00:38.000 --> 00:45.000
But was he being alarmist in calling for an investigation and telling people to keep their kids away from cell phones?

00:45.000 --> 00:50.000
Just how dangerous are cell phones and how exactly do they give you brain cancer, Doctor?

00:50.000 --> 00:52.000
It's essentially cooking the brain.

00:52.000 --> 00:56.000
So my cell phone is cooking my brain, essentially.

00:56.000 --> 01:02.000
Which is rather odd because normally when you cook brains you have to heat them up to the point where the proteins break down.

01:02.000 --> 01:06.000
But OK, how does my tiny cell phone manage to do this?

01:06.000 --> 01:07.000
Over to you, Doctor.

01:07.000 --> 01:14.000
Well, if you hold a phone directly to your head, you're basically microwaving the head because that's the same signal strength.

01:14.000 --> 01:21.000
Well, if it's basically the same signal strength as a microwave oven, then yes, it must be basically cooking my brain.

01:21.000 --> 01:23.000
Because that's what microwaves do.

01:23.000 --> 01:32.000
They energise water molecules and heat up anything that contains water, like brains or eggs, and they keep heating it until eventually.

01:34.000 --> 01:38.000
So never mind whether my cell phone will give me a tumour in ten years' time.

01:38.000 --> 01:43.000
If a cell phone signal has the same strength as a microwave oven and it's cooking my brain,

01:43.000 --> 01:50.000
then I've got more immediate problems to deal with, like having my brain turned into an omelette after just ten minutes on the phone.

01:51.000 --> 01:56.000
But of course it doesn't turn into an omelette, so there must be something wrong with this cooking the brain idea.

01:56.000 --> 01:59.000
And it's pretty obvious what it is.

01:59.000 --> 02:01.000
That's the same signal strength.

02:01.000 --> 02:03.000
No, it's not the same strength as a microwave.

02:03.000 --> 02:10.000
That should be obvious just by checking the capacity of your mobile phone battery. Mine's only 10.5 watt-hours.

02:10.000 --> 02:19.000
If this tiny battery did have enough capacity to power a microwave oven for several hours, then we'd have the answer to the energy storage problem.

02:19.000 --> 02:29.000
The average mobile phone is giving out about 0.75 to 1 watt of power. That compares to over 700 watts for most microwave ovens.

02:29.000 --> 02:36.000
In other words, microwave ovens are around a thousand times more powerful than a mobile phone.

02:36.000 --> 02:42.000
So while a microwave oven is powerful enough to bring the temperature of food up to 100 degrees and cook it,

02:42.000 --> 02:48.000
the best cell phone radiation can do is warm your brain by a fraction of a degree.

02:48.000 --> 02:51.000
And a bit of warming never hurt anyone.

02:51.000 --> 02:54.000
This is something that happens every time you put on a hat.

02:54.000 --> 03:03.000
When the brain's temperature does rise by a fraction of a degree when you put on a hat, blood circulation cools it down again and keeps the brain at an even temperature.

03:03.000 --> 03:10.000
So instead of saying warming, which wouldn't worry anyone, this doctor prefers to use the word heating.

03:10.000 --> 03:15.000
And see if you can spot how quickly he goes from heating to cooking.

03:15.000 --> 03:23.000
Vibrating the water molecules in your brain and it could potentially be heating, cooking the brain over time.

03:23.000 --> 03:26.000
So let's look at the science rather than the hype.

03:26.000 --> 03:30.000
First of all, there are two types of electromagnetic radiation.

03:30.000 --> 03:35.000
There's ionising radiation, like ultraviolet, that can give you melanomas and skin cancer,

03:35.000 --> 03:40.000
and X-rays and gamma rays, these types of shortwave radiation break molecules apart.

03:40.000 --> 03:45.000
So there's no doubt that radiation at this end of the spectrum is dangerous.

03:45.000 --> 03:51.000
But at the other end of the spectrum, that's where we find longer wave radiations like microwaves.

03:51.000 --> 03:55.000
They don't break molecules apart, they just give them energy.

03:55.000 --> 03:58.000
In other words, warm them up as we've seen.

03:58.000 --> 04:02.000
So there's no physical reason why mobile phones should cause cancer,

04:02.000 --> 04:06.000
and the claim that they cook your brain is hyperbolic nonsense.

04:06.000 --> 04:12.000
But since millions of people use them, we have to be sure. We need studies.

04:12.000 --> 04:14.000
And that's where there's a problem.

04:14.000 --> 04:19.000
Because you can't strap thousands of people to bench tops and bombard them with electromagnetic radiation

04:19.000 --> 04:25.000
and keep them away from all other variables for the next 20 years to see what the effect is.

04:25.000 --> 04:32.000
That's why of all the different types of research, medical research on humans is the one most fraught with problems.

04:32.000 --> 04:37.000
So medical researchers have to see what the effect is on animals or tissue samples,

04:37.000 --> 04:40.000
or they have to look at large samples of people living normal lives

04:40.000 --> 04:46.000
and see if they can spot statistical anomalies that might suggest A causes B.

04:46.000 --> 04:49.000
What you can't do is what Russia Today did.

04:49.000 --> 04:55.000
Find one person who has a brain tumour and jump to the conclusion that he got the tumour because he used a cell phone.

04:55.000 --> 04:59.000
Alan suffered serious memory loss after years of using a mobile.

04:59.000 --> 05:04.000
But Alan probably suffered memory loss after years of wearing a necktie.

05:04.000 --> 05:11.000
If we're going to draw medical conclusions from random anecdotal cases, then we can make up any conclusion we like.

05:11.000 --> 05:14.000
John got a toe infection after years of eating beef sandwiches.

05:14.000 --> 05:18.000
Mary suffered lockjaw after years of drinking orange juice.

05:18.000 --> 05:22.000
Michael lost the will to live after years of watching Adam Sandler movies.

05:22.000 --> 05:25.000
OK, maybe there's something in that last one.

05:25.000 --> 05:28.000
But what we need, RT, are proper studies.

05:28.000 --> 05:33.000
Independent scientists, meanwhile, overwhelmingly find the most serious problems,

05:33.000 --> 05:41.000
from DNA damage, three times lower sperm counts, 290% more brain tumours, autism and birth defects.

05:41.000 --> 05:45.000
Autism? I thought conspiracy theorists say that's caused by vaccines.

05:46.000 --> 05:49.000
But anyway, is there any science to back all that up?

05:49.000 --> 05:52.000
As always, we have to check Russia Today's sources.

05:52.000 --> 05:55.000
And unfortunately, they don't give any.

05:55.000 --> 05:59.000
Just saying something like, the University of Washington, isn't enough.

05:59.000 --> 06:03.000
We need to know the title of the paper and the date of publication.

06:03.000 --> 06:09.000
But my guess is that RT is referring to this 1995 paper by Lai and Singh,

06:09.000 --> 06:14.000
which comes from the University of Washington and has been cited a number of times as evidence for a link.

06:14.000 --> 06:18.000
And this falls into one category of research, research on animals.

06:18.000 --> 06:26.000
The researchers found that just a two-hour exposure to low-level microwave radiation caused breaks in DNA in rats,

06:26.000 --> 06:31.000
and they cited other research that found breaks in DNA can be carcinogenic.

06:31.000 --> 06:39.000
The problem is that research is over 20 years old, and nearly all the other studies on animals find no effect.

06:39.000 --> 06:44.000
In vitro experiments, that's working on tissue samples, haven't fared any better.

06:44.000 --> 06:50.000
According to a 2011 paper in the Journal of the National Cancer Institute in the USA,

06:50.000 --> 06:56.000
there have been negative findings from virtually all experimental animal and in vitro studies.

06:56.000 --> 06:59.000
The National Cancer Institute itself concludes,

06:59.000 --> 07:07.000
in animal studies, cell phone use has not been found to cause cancer or to enhance the cancer-causing effect of known chemical carcinogens.

07:09.000 --> 07:15.000
Then an animal study burst onto the scene in 2016 that changed everything.

07:15.000 --> 07:20.000
A major US government study on rats finds a link between cell phones and cancer,

07:20.000 --> 07:25.000
an explosive development in the long-running debate over the health effects of mobile phones.

07:25.000 --> 07:28.000
The study was called game-changing, according to Mother Jones.

07:28.000 --> 07:34.000
The Wall Street Journal, the Daily Mail and other media were convinced that a link had now been found.

07:34.000 --> 07:36.000
Natural news went even further.

07:36.000 --> 07:43.000
Decades of denials and attacks by the media, which called people concerned about cell phone radiation tinfoil hat-wearing conspiracy theorists.

07:43.000 --> 07:50.000
A massive multi-year study funded by the federal government now concludes that, yes, cell phone radiation causes brain cancer!

07:57.000 --> 07:59.000
But what did the study actually show?

07:59.000 --> 08:05.000
Well, it showed that tinfoil hat-wearing conspiracy theorists don't know how to read a scientific paper.

08:05.000 --> 08:14.000
They put mice and rats into these specially designed chambers where they could expose them at different intervals of RF energy,

08:14.000 --> 08:16.000
which is the kind of energy that comes off of cell phones.

08:16.000 --> 08:20.000
The results were only released from the rat portion of the study.

08:20.000 --> 08:22.000
We don't know what the impacts were on the mice.

08:22.000 --> 08:24.000
But they were in these chambers.

08:24.000 --> 08:33.000
They were exposed in on-off intervals of 10 minutes on, 10 minutes off for 18 hours a day for a total of 9 hours of exposure a day for about 2 years.

08:33.000 --> 08:37.000
So the same level of cell phone radiation that a human would be exposed.

08:37.000 --> 08:42.000
No, 9 hours a day, 7 days a week is a lot more than most cell phone users are exposed to.

08:42.000 --> 08:46.000
But anyway, let's look at the study itself rather than the media hype.

08:46.000 --> 08:50.000
The study wasn't published in a respected peer-reviewed journal.

08:50.000 --> 08:52.000
It was posted online.

08:52.000 --> 08:54.000
So it hadn't been adjusted for peer review.

08:54.000 --> 09:02.000
The only way you can find out what the peer reviewers thought is to scroll right down to the end of the paper where their conclusions are tacked on.

09:02.000 --> 09:04.000
And they're very revealing.

09:04.000 --> 09:11.000
Several reviewers pointed out that the tumours were mostly found in the male rats, but not the female rats.

09:11.000 --> 09:17.000
So the study could just as easily have concluded that it's safe for women to use cell phones, but not men.

09:17.000 --> 09:26.000
And even in the male rats, one reviewer concludes that there's better evidence for carcinogenic effects in the heart rather than the brain.

09:26.000 --> 09:31.000
Another pointed out that the rate of tumour in the control group was far lower than normal.

09:31.000 --> 09:37.000
The inference is that it may not be the male rats subjected to RF radiation that are getting more tumours than normal.

09:37.000 --> 09:41.000
It's more likely that the control group are getting fewer.

09:41.000 --> 09:49.000
One bizarre result of the study was that the rats that were exposed to microwave radiation lived longer than those that weren't.

09:49.000 --> 09:56.000
In short, this study was neither game-changing, nor did it definitively show that mobile phones are linked to cancer.

09:56.000 --> 10:04.000
It's interesting that in reporting a possible link, the conclusions become more assured the further down the news feeding chain you go.

10:04.000 --> 10:09.000
Respected scientific magazines like New Scientist and Science urged caution.

10:09.000 --> 10:13.000
Most news media put a possibly or a maybe in with the link.

10:13.000 --> 10:18.000
But when we get down to the tabloids, the Daily Mail assumed this was a certainty.

10:19.000 --> 10:29.000
And when you get to the bottom feeders, the bloggers, they not only saw this as absolute proof, they also saw it as a slap in the face for all those who weren't on board the conspiracy train.

10:29.000 --> 10:38.000
This is rigorous science, said Natural News, and it shows a clear dose-related causative link between exposure to cell phone radiation and the development of brain and heart tumours.

10:38.000 --> 10:44.000
For decades the government has actively conspired with industry to downplay any evidence linking cell phones to cancer.

10:44.000 --> 10:50.000
The entire federal government as it operates today is little more than the science propaganda and marketing arm of private industry.

10:54.000 --> 11:03.000
You know, Natural News might have more credibility if it hired a health correspondent with some training in this field, rather than what's called a health ranger.

11:03.000 --> 11:12.000
And his reporting might benefit from actually reading the study, rather than simply grabbing quotes from other media outlets that got the story wrong.

11:12.000 --> 11:17.000
OK, so animal studies didn't show any clear evidence that mobile phones cause cancer.

11:17.000 --> 11:22.000
But there is another way to find out. Do what's called a case control study.

11:22.000 --> 11:33.000
Look at a sample group of people who already have brain tumours and see how many use mobile phones, and compare that with a representative group of people who don't have brain tumours.

11:33.000 --> 11:38.000
There are quite a few important studies. It's a bit of a mixed bag, but let me try to summarise.

11:38.000 --> 11:41.000
The figures, by the way, don't include controls.

11:41.000 --> 11:51.000
A 2008 study of 352 adolescents with brain tumours found no significant difference in brain tumours between those who used cell phones and those who didn't.

11:51.000 --> 12:01.000
A 2011 study of 6420 people with different types of brain tumours also found no increased risk due to cell phone use.

12:01.000 --> 12:07.000
Only among very heavy cell phone users did the researchers conclude there was a possible risk of glioma.

12:07.000 --> 12:22.000
But this was inconclusive. A 2014 study of 1500 patients did find an increased risk of two types of tumour, glioma and acoustic neuroma, for people who use cell phones for more than 30 minutes a day over 10 years.

12:22.000 --> 12:31.000
A 2013 study of 447 people found no link with brain tumours for average cell phone users, but it did find a link with the heaviest users.

12:32.000 --> 12:42.000
So the studies of existing brain cancer patients don't find an association with ordinary cell phone use, but some suggest there may be an association with heavy cell phone use.

12:42.000 --> 12:54.000
And finally, there's one more way of determining if there's a link, and that's to see if brain tumour rates have increased in the phone-using population since mobile phones came into popular use in the mid 1990s.

12:54.000 --> 13:02.000
Well, they haven't, at least according to the research. In Japan, researchers looked at 7000 people in their 20s and 30s.

13:02.000 --> 13:13.000
If mobile phone use did cause brain cancer, then the older participants should have a higher rate of cancer than the younger ones, because they would have used mobile phones over a longer period of time.

13:14.000 --> 13:22.000
In women, there was a slight increase, and in men the association was the opposite. Neither was statistically significant.

13:22.000 --> 13:27.000
And there didn't seem to be an association between brain cancer and heavy use.

13:27.000 --> 13:41.000
Same with a 2016 study in Australia, and a 2011 Danish cohort study of 420,000 people, although that study has been criticised for excluding business people who would be among the heaviest mobile phone users.

13:42.000 --> 13:56.000
In the United States, brain cancer rates have even been in decline since cell phones came into popular use, and although they've increased in the United Kingdom over the last 30 years, most of that increase occurred before mobile phones became popular.

13:56.000 --> 13:59.000
And since then, they've been more or less flat.

13:59.000 --> 14:11.000
Of course, it's possible that it takes more than 20 years for any cancer to manifest itself, but epidemiologists would expect at least some cases to start showing up before then, and nothing's showing up so far.

14:11.000 --> 14:23.000
So the research is fairly clear using three separate methods. There is a possibility that heavy phone use might cause cancer, but most of the evidence shows no such link to any kind of phone use.

14:23.000 --> 14:29.000
That's why nearly every major organisation involved in this field says there's no evidence of a link.

14:29.000 --> 14:51.000
The US Food and Drug Administration, the Federal Communications Commission, the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences, US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the European Commission's Scientific Committee on Emerging and Newly Identified Health Risks, or Exkennihir to give it its short name, all say studies have failed to show a link between cell phones and cancer.

14:51.000 --> 14:56.000
But most do suggest that further research is needed, just to be sure.

14:56.000 --> 15:05.000
Only one relevant body has put cell phones on its list of possible carcinogens, and that's the United Nations International Agency for Research on Cancer.

15:05.000 --> 15:13.000
It's part of the World Health Organization. But it's more a precautionary stance than the result of any definitive study.

15:13.000 --> 15:18.000
But that didn't stop the media hype when the IARC classification was announced.

15:18.000 --> 15:24.000
According to the WHO, dialing your cell phone could be like punching in a cook time and holding a microwave to your head.

15:24.000 --> 15:27.000
No, that's not what the WHO said at all.

15:27.000 --> 15:29.000
It's vibrating the water molecules in your brain.

15:29.000 --> 15:30.000
Not again.

15:30.000 --> 15:33.000
Independent scientists, meanwhile, overwhelmingly find the most serious problems.

15:33.000 --> 15:40.000
Yet, researchers are not overwhelmingly finding problems. They're overwhelmingly finding no problems.

15:40.000 --> 15:54.000
What Russia Today has done is what the media always do when they go on a crusade, which is to cherry-pick only those studies that show a possible link, turn that into a definite link, and then ignore the overwhelming majority of studies that show no link at all.

15:54.000 --> 16:02.000
And, of course, quote one or two scientists who support the crusade, and ignore the majority of researchers whose conclusions don't fit.

16:02.000 --> 16:05.000
We've seen a few examples, but here's another one.

16:05.000 --> 16:09.000
In 2016, there were headlines in The Times and The Daily Mirror.

16:09.000 --> 16:15.000
Men who keep mobile phones in their trouser pockets risk their sperm being cooked, worrying, researchers claimed.

16:15.000 --> 16:19.000
But even in the story itself, there's a clue that this claim may be nonsense.

16:19.000 --> 16:27.000
The Daily Mirror tells us that only 106 people were tested, which is not likely to give a statistically significant result.

16:27.000 --> 16:32.000
And when you read the paper itself, sure enough, it doesn't reflect the media's bold claims.

16:32.000 --> 16:35.000
Even the title of the paper should be a clue.

16:35.000 --> 16:40.000
Habits of cell phone use and sperm quality. Does it warrant attention?

16:40.000 --> 16:45.000
Even the authors aren't suggesting that their results show a link between mobile phones and low sperm count,

16:45.000 --> 16:52.000
only that it's an area that should be investigated with a proper study of more than just 106 people.

16:53.000 --> 16:58.000
The bottom line is that there may possibly be a link between cancer and heavy cell phone use,

16:58.000 --> 17:04.000
but the fact is that there's no known mechanism for such a link, and most studies don't show any such link.

17:04.000 --> 17:09.000
So by all means let researchers keep studying the problem, but let's stop swallowing all the media hype

17:09.000 --> 17:13.000
and the blogosphere bullshit and follow the science.

17:13.000 --> 17:16.000
If you're worried, then use an earpiece.

17:16.000 --> 17:19.000
That freaks me out because I don't want cancer.

17:19.000 --> 17:23.000
To get all that, it's important to note that mobile phones are dangerous,

17:23.000 --> 17:27.000
and numerous peer-reviewed studies have shown that they can kill you.

17:27.000 --> 17:30.000
No, they're not going to cook your brain or bake your sperm.

17:30.000 --> 17:38.000
These are studies that show people have been killed and seriously injured by using their mobile phones while driving.

17:38.000 --> 17:47.000
In the UK, the Department of Transport says that in 2012, distraction due to mobile phones caused 17 deaths in car crashes.

17:47.000 --> 17:55.000
The National Safety Council in the USA reports that cell phones were involved in 350 fatal car crashes in 2011.

17:55.000 --> 18:01.000
Yet if you believe the blogosphere, we seem to be more worried about a phony danger than a real one.

18:01.000 --> 18:08.000
Now be honest, before you watch this video, how many of you were a little concerned that your cell phone might give you brain cancer?

18:08.000 --> 18:12.000
And how many of you have talked on the phone or texted while driving?

18:12.000 --> 18:16.000
To be honest, before I check the facts, me too.

18:16.000 --> 18:19.000
We are a strange species.
