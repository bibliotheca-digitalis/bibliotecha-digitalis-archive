0	5360	My channel doesn't ask for money, and unlike most YouTubers I don't make these videos for financial
5360	10800	gain. But since people have frequently asked if they can contribute something, I've suggested
10800	16240	they send money to an innovative charity called Health in Harmony. I'm in the process of trying
16240	22240	to monetise my channel, and I've nominated Health in Harmony as the beneficiary. So I have some
22240	27600	important news about their work. The charity's unique system of trading healthcare for forest
27600	33520	protection is now the subject of a peer-reviewed study from Stanford University just published in
33520	38960	the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. It confirms that the model has resulted
38960	46640	in 70% less deforestation in an important national park, saving over 27 square kilometres
46640	53440	of rainforest. The study also found that it's provided cheap medical services for over 28,000
53440	59920	people who would otherwise have been cutting down trees to pay for healthcare. The model is now being
59920	66560	extended from the forests of Borneo to Madagascar and Amazonia, funded in large part by contributions
66560	72080	from my subscribers. Before I show you the figures I'll explain briefly how it started
72080	78400	and how it works. For years people living along the Gunung Palung National Park in Borneo
78400	83440	have been cutting down trees devastating the forest of the national park and threatening
83440	89680	endangered wildlife. An American doctor working in the area discovered that many of her patients
89680	96800	resorted to cutting down trees not out of greed but to pay medical bills. Here's how she tells it.
96800	103200	We could hear chainsaws all the time illegally logging in the national park and now
103200	112640	you can't hear them anywhere. The reason is we did something crazy. We actually listened. They told us
112640	118080	that what they would need would be access to high quality affordable healthcare so they wouldn't have
118080	123360	to log to pay for healthcare and they needed training in sustainable agriculture particularly
123360	129040	in organic farming. So that's what we did. We had an 88% drop in logging households
129040	134320	and we've had a drop in under five mortality.
136240	140080	The environment is healthier and the humans are healthier and happier.
142080	147440	We are so excited about replicating this model. There are many other places we would like to work.
148320	153680	The doctor Kinari Webb co-founded a clinic next to the national park with an energetic
153760	159920	Indonesian dentist Hotlin Ompasungu. Young doctors and dentists in Indonesia were more
159920	164800	than willing to come out and help and gain much needed medical experience in the process.
165680	171120	So now anyone from a village that's joined the pledge not to cut down trees gets treated by the
171120	178240	clinic for 30% of the normal cost of medical care. If they can't even afford that they can pay that
178240	185280	30% not with cash but in the form of tree saplings or compost. The compost is given
185280	191200	to another of the charity's projects which is teaching sustainable agriculture to local farmers
191200	197120	who traditionally practice slash and burn. That takes pressure off the forest and gives the
197120	202960	villagers a healthier diet. The tree saplings are taken to areas of the national park that have been
202960	209200	heavily logged and replanted. That not only helps restore the forest it gives the charity
209200	216240	carbon credits which pays for running the clinic. I first came across this innovative charity when
216240	222720	I was invited to the Whitley Environmental Awards in London when it won top prize. I pitched the
222720	228560	story to the BBC and they commissioned a 30-minute program from me. When I went out to Borneo I was
228560	233920	so impressed with what I saw that when people kept wanting to sponsor my YouTube channel
233920	240880	I told them to instead give the money to Health in Harmony. And this is the result. To date you,
240880	247840	my subscribers, have generously donated over $100,000. These are all the contributions that
247840	253920	have mentioned my name or the channel name in the last three years. And I was delighted to discover
253920	259360	that many of you opened standing orders for recurring contributions. Others put money in
259360	265120	every time they watch one of my videos. These contributions have helped Health in Harmony expand
265120	272160	its activities into Madagascar and the Shingu National Park in Brazil. If monetisation happens
272160	277680	all of the money, not some of it, all of it, will go directly to Health in Harmony's PayPal account.
278240	283520	So please let the ads run if they appear and don't let that stop you supporting the charity
283520	288880	with your own contributions. If monetisation doesn't happen then your contributions will
288880	294080	be more important than ever. Because they've made a big difference not only to Health in Harmony
294080	299280	but they encourage me to get off my backside and make these videos, even during times when I'd
299280	305120	rather be doing something else. So whether you want to support a charity that protects forests
305120	311040	or one that saves animals or one that improves healthcare, now you can do all three. There's
311040	316240	something in it for everyone. And even if you want all the forests to be destroyed, you hate
316240	321680	animals and you're not bothered about the health of people you don't know, hey make a contribution
321680	326960	or watch the ads anyway. After all even you misanthropes are getting a free platform to
326960	330480	vent your rage and tell the world how much you hate me.
