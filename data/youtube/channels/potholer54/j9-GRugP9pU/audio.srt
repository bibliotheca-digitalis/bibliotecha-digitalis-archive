1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,360
My channel doesn't ask for money, and unlike most YouTubers I don't make these videos for financial

2
00:00:05,360 --> 00:00:10,800
gain. But since people have frequently asked if they can contribute something, I've suggested

3
00:00:10,800 --> 00:00:16,240
they send money to an innovative charity called Health in Harmony. I'm in the process of trying

4
00:00:16,240 --> 00:00:22,240
to monetise my channel, and I've nominated Health in Harmony as the beneficiary. So I have some

5
00:00:22,240 --> 00:00:27,600
important news about their work. The charity's unique system of trading healthcare for forest

6
00:00:27,600 --> 00:00:33,520
protection is now the subject of a peer-reviewed study from Stanford University just published in

7
00:00:33,520 --> 00:00:38,960
the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. It confirms that the model has resulted

8
00:00:38,960 --> 00:00:46,640
in 70% less deforestation in an important national park, saving over 27 square kilometres

9
00:00:46,640 --> 00:00:53,440
of rainforest. The study also found that it's provided cheap medical services for over 28,000

10
00:00:53,440 --> 00:00:59,920
people who would otherwise have been cutting down trees to pay for healthcare. The model is now being

11
00:00:59,920 --> 00:01:06,560
extended from the forests of Borneo to Madagascar and Amazonia, funded in large part by contributions

12
00:01:06,560 --> 00:01:12,080
from my subscribers. Before I show you the figures I'll explain briefly how it started

13
00:01:12,080 --> 00:01:18,400
and how it works. For years people living along the Gunung Palung National Park in Borneo

14
00:01:18,400 --> 00:01:23,440
have been cutting down trees devastating the forest of the national park and threatening

15
00:01:23,440 --> 00:01:29,680
endangered wildlife. An American doctor working in the area discovered that many of her patients

16
00:01:29,680 --> 00:01:36,800
resorted to cutting down trees not out of greed but to pay medical bills. Here's how she tells it.

17
00:01:36,800 --> 00:01:43,200
We could hear chainsaws all the time illegally logging in the national park and now

18
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:52,640
you can't hear them anywhere. The reason is we did something crazy. We actually listened. They told us

19
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:58,080
that what they would need would be access to high quality affordable healthcare so they wouldn't have

20
00:01:58,080 --> 00:02:03,360
to log to pay for healthcare and they needed training in sustainable agriculture particularly

21
00:02:03,360 --> 00:02:09,040
in organic farming. So that's what we did. We had an 88% drop in logging households

22
00:02:09,040 --> 00:02:14,320
and we've had a drop in under five mortality.

23
00:02:16,240 --> 00:02:20,080
The environment is healthier and the humans are healthier and happier.

24
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:27,440
We are so excited about replicating this model. There are many other places we would like to work.

25
00:02:28,320 --> 00:02:33,680
The doctor Kinari Webb co-founded a clinic next to the national park with an energetic

26
00:02:33,760 --> 00:02:39,920
Indonesian dentist Hotlin Ompasungu. Young doctors and dentists in Indonesia were more

27
00:02:39,920 --> 00:02:44,800
than willing to come out and help and gain much needed medical experience in the process.

28
00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:51,120
So now anyone from a village that's joined the pledge not to cut down trees gets treated by the

29
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:58,240
clinic for 30% of the normal cost of medical care. If they can't even afford that they can pay that

30
00:02:58,240 --> 00:03:05,280
30% not with cash but in the form of tree saplings or compost. The compost is given

31
00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:11,200
to another of the charity's projects which is teaching sustainable agriculture to local farmers

32
00:03:11,200 --> 00:03:17,120
who traditionally practice slash and burn. That takes pressure off the forest and gives the

33
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:22,960
villagers a healthier diet. The tree saplings are taken to areas of the national park that have been

34
00:03:22,960 --> 00:03:29,200
heavily logged and replanted. That not only helps restore the forest it gives the charity

35
00:03:29,200 --> 00:03:36,240
carbon credits which pays for running the clinic. I first came across this innovative charity when

36
00:03:36,240 --> 00:03:42,720
I was invited to the Whitley Environmental Awards in London when it won top prize. I pitched the

37
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:48,560
story to the BBC and they commissioned a 30-minute program from me. When I went out to Borneo I was

38
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:53,920
so impressed with what I saw that when people kept wanting to sponsor my YouTube channel

39
00:03:53,920 --> 00:04:00,880
I told them to instead give the money to Health in Harmony. And this is the result. To date you,

40
00:04:00,880 --> 00:04:07,840
my subscribers, have generously donated over $100,000. These are all the contributions that

41
00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:13,920
have mentioned my name or the channel name in the last three years. And I was delighted to discover

42
00:04:13,920 --> 00:04:19,360
that many of you opened standing orders for recurring contributions. Others put money in

43
00:04:19,360 --> 00:04:25,120
every time they watch one of my videos. These contributions have helped Health in Harmony expand

44
00:04:25,120 --> 00:04:32,160
its activities into Madagascar and the Shingu National Park in Brazil. If monetisation happens

45
00:04:32,160 --> 00:04:37,680
all of the money, not some of it, all of it, will go directly to Health in Harmony's PayPal account.

46
00:04:38,240 --> 00:04:43,520
So please let the ads run if they appear and don't let that stop you supporting the charity

47
00:04:43,520 --> 00:04:48,880
with your own contributions. If monetisation doesn't happen then your contributions will

48
00:04:48,880 --> 00:04:54,080
be more important than ever. Because they've made a big difference not only to Health in Harmony

49
00:04:54,080 --> 00:04:59,280
but they encourage me to get off my backside and make these videos, even during times when I'd

50
00:04:59,280 --> 00:05:05,120
rather be doing something else. So whether you want to support a charity that protects forests

51
00:05:05,120 --> 00:05:11,040
or one that saves animals or one that improves healthcare, now you can do all three. There's

52
00:05:11,040 --> 00:05:16,240
something in it for everyone. And even if you want all the forests to be destroyed, you hate

53
00:05:16,240 --> 00:05:21,680
animals and you're not bothered about the health of people you don't know, hey make a contribution

54
00:05:21,680 --> 00:05:26,960
or watch the ads anyway. After all even you misanthropes are getting a free platform to

55
00:05:26,960 --> 00:05:30,480
vent your rage and tell the world how much you hate me.
