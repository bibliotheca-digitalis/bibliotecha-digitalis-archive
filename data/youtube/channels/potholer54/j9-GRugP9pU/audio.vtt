My channel doesn't ask for money, and unlike most YouTubers I don't make these videos for financial

00:05.360 --> 00:10.800
gain. But since people have frequently asked if they can contribute something, I've suggested

00:10.800 --> 00:16.240
they send money to an innovative charity called Health in Harmony. I'm in the process of trying

00:16.240 --> 00:22.240
to monetise my channel, and I've nominated Health in Harmony as the beneficiary. So I have some

00:22.240 --> 00:27.600
important news about their work. The charity's unique system of trading healthcare for forest

00:27.600 --> 00:33.520
protection is now the subject of a peer-reviewed study from Stanford University just published in

00:33.520 --> 00:38.960
the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. It confirms that the model has resulted

00:38.960 --> 00:46.640
in 70% less deforestation in an important national park, saving over 27 square kilometres

00:46.640 --> 00:53.440
of rainforest. The study also found that it's provided cheap medical services for over 28,000

00:53.440 --> 00:59.920
people who would otherwise have been cutting down trees to pay for healthcare. The model is now being

00:59.920 --> 01:06.560
extended from the forests of Borneo to Madagascar and Amazonia, funded in large part by contributions

01:06.560 --> 01:12.080
from my subscribers. Before I show you the figures I'll explain briefly how it started

01:12.080 --> 01:18.400
and how it works. For years people living along the Gunung Palung National Park in Borneo

01:18.400 --> 01:23.440
have been cutting down trees devastating the forest of the national park and threatening

01:23.440 --> 01:29.680
endangered wildlife. An American doctor working in the area discovered that many of her patients

01:29.680 --> 01:36.800
resorted to cutting down trees not out of greed but to pay medical bills. Here's how she tells it.

01:36.800 --> 01:43.200
We could hear chainsaws all the time illegally logging in the national park and now

01:43.200 --> 01:52.640
you can't hear them anywhere. The reason is we did something crazy. We actually listened. They told us

01:52.640 --> 01:58.080
that what they would need would be access to high quality affordable healthcare so they wouldn't have

01:58.080 --> 02:03.360
to log to pay for healthcare and they needed training in sustainable agriculture particularly

02:03.360 --> 02:09.040
in organic farming. So that's what we did. We had an 88% drop in logging households

02:09.040 --> 02:14.320
and we've had a drop in under five mortality.

02:16.240 --> 02:20.080
The environment is healthier and the humans are healthier and happier.

02:22.080 --> 02:27.440
We are so excited about replicating this model. There are many other places we would like to work.

02:28.320 --> 02:33.680
The doctor Kinari Webb co-founded a clinic next to the national park with an energetic

02:33.760 --> 02:39.920
Indonesian dentist Hotlin Ompasungu. Young doctors and dentists in Indonesia were more

02:39.920 --> 02:44.800
than willing to come out and help and gain much needed medical experience in the process.

02:45.680 --> 02:51.120
So now anyone from a village that's joined the pledge not to cut down trees gets treated by the

02:51.120 --> 02:58.240
clinic for 30% of the normal cost of medical care. If they can't even afford that they can pay that

02:58.240 --> 03:05.280
30% not with cash but in the form of tree saplings or compost. The compost is given

03:05.280 --> 03:11.200
to another of the charity's projects which is teaching sustainable agriculture to local farmers

03:11.200 --> 03:17.120
who traditionally practice slash and burn. That takes pressure off the forest and gives the

03:17.120 --> 03:22.960
villagers a healthier diet. The tree saplings are taken to areas of the national park that have been

03:22.960 --> 03:29.200
heavily logged and replanted. That not only helps restore the forest it gives the charity

03:29.200 --> 03:36.240
carbon credits which pays for running the clinic. I first came across this innovative charity when

03:36.240 --> 03:42.720
I was invited to the Whitley Environmental Awards in London when it won top prize. I pitched the

03:42.720 --> 03:48.560
story to the BBC and they commissioned a 30-minute program from me. When I went out to Borneo I was

03:48.560 --> 03:53.920
so impressed with what I saw that when people kept wanting to sponsor my YouTube channel

03:53.920 --> 04:00.880
I told them to instead give the money to Health in Harmony. And this is the result. To date you,

04:00.880 --> 04:07.840
my subscribers, have generously donated over $100,000. These are all the contributions that

04:07.840 --> 04:13.920
have mentioned my name or the channel name in the last three years. And I was delighted to discover

04:13.920 --> 04:19.360
that many of you opened standing orders for recurring contributions. Others put money in

04:19.360 --> 04:25.120
every time they watch one of my videos. These contributions have helped Health in Harmony expand

04:25.120 --> 04:32.160
its activities into Madagascar and the Shingu National Park in Brazil. If monetisation happens

04:32.160 --> 04:37.680
all of the money, not some of it, all of it, will go directly to Health in Harmony's PayPal account.

04:38.240 --> 04:43.520
So please let the ads run if they appear and don't let that stop you supporting the charity

04:43.520 --> 04:48.880
with your own contributions. If monetisation doesn't happen then your contributions will

04:48.880 --> 04:54.080
be more important than ever. Because they've made a big difference not only to Health in Harmony

04:54.080 --> 04:59.280
but they encourage me to get off my backside and make these videos, even during times when I'd

04:59.280 --> 05:05.120
rather be doing something else. So whether you want to support a charity that protects forests

05:05.120 --> 05:11.040
or one that saves animals or one that improves healthcare, now you can do all three. There's

05:11.040 --> 05:16.240
something in it for everyone. And even if you want all the forests to be destroyed, you hate

05:16.240 --> 05:21.680
animals and you're not bothered about the health of people you don't know, hey make a contribution

05:21.680 --> 05:26.960
or watch the ads anyway. After all even you misanthropes are getting a free platform to

05:26.960 --> 05:30.480
vent your rage and tell the world how much you hate me.
