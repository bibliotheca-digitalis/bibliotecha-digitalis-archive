0	8000	In my last video I bust the myth that the 3.4% case fatality rate announced on March 3rd was false
8000	15000	and I showed that posters who insisted the number was wrong were confusing it with the infection fatality rate.
15000	18000	At the end of the video I predicted this.
18000	22000	My bet is that the next response will be, well it doesn't matter anyway.
22000	27000	And guess what? A batch of posts that said, well it doesn't matter anyway.
28000	35000	Instead they tried a new argument, that the deaths due to Covid-19 aren't really deaths due to Covid-19.
35000	40000	So in this constant game of whack-a-mole I'm going to whack that one down too.
40000	47000	By the way, at the end of the video I'd like subscribers to give me some advice and opinions about a possible change to the channel.
47000	49000	Nothing drastic.
49000	51000	But back to the new argument.
51000	61000	A lot of people said it doesn't matter anyway because according to the CDC, apparently, only 6% of Covid deaths are actually due to Covid-19.
61000	66000	It wasn't hard to track this myth down because the President himself has been spreading it.
66000	78000	This week the CDC quietly updated the Covid number to admit that only 6% of all the 153,504 deaths recorded actually died from Covid.
78000	85000	But as you can probably guess, Twitter isn't the most reliable platform for relaying scientific information.
85000	90000	So did the CDC really say this? Well, not quite.
90000	97000	What it actually said was, for 6% of the deaths, Covid-19 was the only cause mentioned.
97000	99000	Doesn't that mean the same thing?
99000	110000	No. What the figure means, and you don't need to guess because the CDC explains exactly what it means, is that 6% of Covid deaths showed no comorbidities.
110000	114000	In other words, no other health conditions at the time of death.
114000	121000	And that low percentage is quite normal because viruses nearly always cause other health conditions.
121000	126000	Measles, for example, causes pneumonia, dehydration and encephalitis.
126000	130000	HIV causes pneumonia and cardiovascular disease.
130000	134000	The Ebola virus causes haemorrhaging and malaria.
134000	139000	And as we know, Covid-19 causes pneumonia and cardiac arrhythmia.
139000	144000	On top of that, a third of Americans have some kind of pre-existing health condition.
144000	151000	So it's pretty obvious that having comorbidities for any virus is the rule, not the exception.
151000	162000	The original source of this claim seems to have been a website called The Virus Truth, which, as you can guess from the title, is a blog specifically designed to spread disinformation about the virus.
162000	173000	There's even a page on the link between 5G and Coronavirus, and a page which shows how Covid-19 is being deliberately sprayed onto door handles at Trump-owned buildings.
173000	186000	And just to show what a weird place the internet has become, some of you probably do believe that coronavirus is being deliberately sprayed onto door handles at Trump-owned buildings, even though that's not on the website and I just made it up.
186000	198000	Since that first blog of... No, I made up the claim about coronavirus being sprayed onto door handles. You can stop believing it now. It's not a thing, not even in conspiracy sites.
198000	201000	Too late, it's probably already trending.
201000	211000	Anyway, since that blog first appeared, the 6% claim has been copied and pasted verbatim all over the internet, from Twitter to Facebook to Reddit.
211000	219000	Just to be clear, the CDC didn't quietly update the Covid number. That suggests the CDC didn't want anyone to know about it.
219000	229000	It posts an update at the same time every week, and this one was no different. Millions of people read these posts, they're publicly available and hardly secret.
229000	233000	And it didn't admit anything, it simply reported the facts.
233000	241000	Admit is one of those wonderful editorial words that makes it look as though someone's been hiding something or that a previous claim has been reversed.
241000	250000	In this case, it was neither. The CDC was simply stating facts about comorbidities and anyone could access their website to see the facts.
251000	260000	And at the time of writing, the CDC is still stating the same facts in its weekly updates, and that particular figure is still 6%.
260000	275000	Before I move on, it is a tad unorthodox for the President of a country to get important medical information from a tweet, given that he has a team of experts, including the head of the CDC itself, on call day or night to explain the facts.
275000	289000	But formulating US policy on the basis of something someone copied from a blog to a tweet has become so normal now, I'm sure a lot of people would think it churlish and un-American for me to even mention it. Sorry.
289000	295000	Let's face the fact that that's now perfectly normal in the United States and get back to the fact checking.
295000	303000	Critics who are determined not to blame Covid-19 for these deaths, don't ask me why, also tried another tack.
303000	311000	Just because people died with Covid-19, they say, that doesn't mean they died of or from Covid-19.
311000	318000	Maybe it was the pre-existing condition that killed them. After all, people die of diabetes and heart failure every day.
318000	325000	Or maybe they've been shot or killed in a car crash and just happen to have Covid at the same time, so Covid gets the blame.
325000	331000	This is true to a certain extent. A small percentage of those cases might have died anyway.
331000	339000	But in the case of shootings and car crashes, that number is known because they show up as a comorbidity under this listing.
339000	344000	Intentional and unintentional injury, poisoning and other adverse events.
344000	352000	They number just 6,800 out of 201,000 deaths at the time of writing, just over 3%.
352000	357000	And it's also pretty easy to quantify how many people would have died regardless of the pandemic,
357000	362000	because all you have to do is look at the average number of deaths over the previous five years.
362000	367000	For example, in New York City the death rate remains pretty constant.
367000	374000	It rose in September 2001, for obvious reasons, and it rises slightly during each winter flu season.
374000	380000	But in the absence of a pandemic or a terrorist attack, it's pretty constant.
380000	385000	So it's not hard to predict how many people would die in an ordinary year.
385000	394000	But for some reason, when New York was hit by the Covid-19 pandemic, the number of deaths suddenly shot up. Coincidence?
394000	401000	So the critics have come up with another argument. Maybe these extra deaths were connected to the pandemic in a different way.
401000	406000	Maybe they're caused by suicide. You know, people were depressed because of lockdown.
406000	410000	Well firstly, no, because again that would show up in the figures.
410000	417000	People usually commit suicide by shooting themselves in the head, or hanging themselves, or jumping off bridges.
417000	424000	So while that might explain some of the deaths attributed to Covid, in the 3-4% of intentional injury category,
424000	429000	that still leaves around 97% of Covid deaths that aren't due to suicide.
429000	435000	People don't normally commit suicide through obesity, and if they did it would take time.
435000	440000	Secondly, there's not always a correlation between excess deaths and lockdowns.
440000	445000	Sweden, for example, didn't lockdown, while Norway, Finland and Denmark did.
445000	451000	But Sweden had far more extra deaths during the pandemic than its Scandinavian neighbours.
451000	456000	So here's another one. One poster suggested that all these people died of old age.
456000	463000	Her logic was that there were 13 million more old people in 2019 compared to 2010.
463000	466000	More old people, more deaths.
466000	470000	Look, it's always worth considering other options.
470000	474000	But the number of elderly people goes up by several million every year.
474000	479000	I wonder why they would suddenly all die at a time when there's a deadly pandemic.
479000	484000	Again, coincidence. It's like saying that 200 people didn't die in a plane crash,
484000	488000	they just happened to die of old age at the time the plane was crashing.
488000	494000	There comes a point at which you have to say, look guys, give it up, it's a pandemic.
494000	500000	The more outlandish the excuses you dream up to avoid that fact, the sillier they look.
500000	507000	By the way, I also got a lot of posts from people who argued that mistakenly saying the 3.4% figure was false
507000	513000	doesn't matter because the CFR was irrelevant and the more important figure was the IFR.
513000	517000	That's certainly true now, as far as the public is concerned,
517000	524000	but of course that 3.4% figure was released on March 3, at a time when an accurate IFR wasn't known.
524000	532000	As was explained at the time, the CFR was just a crude number as a way of estimating how dangerous this new virus might be.
532000	538000	Since then, we've had more infection fatality rate figures and they've become more accurate.
539000	546000	So over the last 8 months, it's the IFR that's been more widely used in the media, not the CFR.
546000	552000	However, the CFR is still an important measure for epidemiologists, health officials and hospital doctors.
552000	557000	It helps them estimate how many patients who get admitted to hospital might die,
557000	561000	and it lets them know how effectively these patients are being treated.
562000	565000	Now onto the question I have about the future of this channel.
565000	569000	A lot of people say they're not getting notifications of new videos,
569000	576000	and I'm told by others that YouTube algorithms are favouring monetized videos that bring in revenue for YouTube.
576000	580000	And of course my channel isn't monetized. I don't make a penny out of this.
580000	587000	I love the way that baffles critics who are determined to show that I must somehow be profiting from these videos.
587000	589000	I don't know why they think that matters anyway.
589000	595000	But the other reason I do it is because I don't like to impose those annoying ads at the beginning of each video.
595000	603000	That now has to be outweighed by the fact that I'm getting sidelined by YouTube because of my failure to monetize the channel.
603000	608000	So what I'd like to know is, will monetizing the channel help promote my videos?
608000	613000	Would advertisements put people off? What are the pros and cons?
613000	617000	And what's involved in monetization if you've done that on your channel?
618000	622000	Also, how feasible is it to pay the income I'd get directly to a third party,
622000	627000	because I'd like to give the proceeds directly to Health in Harmony, the charity I support.
627000	629000	Any thoughts?
629000	633000	And of course, I look forward to your comments on the video itself.
