00:00.000 --> 00:08.000
In my last video I bust the myth that the 3.4% case fatality rate announced on March 3rd was false

00:08.000 --> 00:15.000
and I showed that posters who insisted the number was wrong were confusing it with the infection fatality rate.

00:15.000 --> 00:18.000
At the end of the video I predicted this.

00:18.000 --> 00:22.000
My bet is that the next response will be, well it doesn't matter anyway.

00:22.000 --> 00:27.000
And guess what? A batch of posts that said, well it doesn't matter anyway.

00:28.000 --> 00:35.000
Instead they tried a new argument, that the deaths due to Covid-19 aren't really deaths due to Covid-19.

00:35.000 --> 00:40.000
So in this constant game of whack-a-mole I'm going to whack that one down too.

00:40.000 --> 00:47.000
By the way, at the end of the video I'd like subscribers to give me some advice and opinions about a possible change to the channel.

00:47.000 --> 00:49.000
Nothing drastic.

00:49.000 --> 00:51.000
But back to the new argument.

00:51.000 --> 01:01.000
A lot of people said it doesn't matter anyway because according to the CDC, apparently, only 6% of Covid deaths are actually due to Covid-19.

01:01.000 --> 01:06.000
It wasn't hard to track this myth down because the President himself has been spreading it.

01:06.000 --> 01:18.000
This week the CDC quietly updated the Covid number to admit that only 6% of all the 153,504 deaths recorded actually died from Covid.

01:18.000 --> 01:25.000
But as you can probably guess, Twitter isn't the most reliable platform for relaying scientific information.

01:25.000 --> 01:30.000
So did the CDC really say this? Well, not quite.

01:30.000 --> 01:37.000
What it actually said was, for 6% of the deaths, Covid-19 was the only cause mentioned.

01:37.000 --> 01:39.000
Doesn't that mean the same thing?

01:39.000 --> 01:50.000
No. What the figure means, and you don't need to guess because the CDC explains exactly what it means, is that 6% of Covid deaths showed no comorbidities.

01:50.000 --> 01:54.000
In other words, no other health conditions at the time of death.

01:54.000 --> 02:01.000
And that low percentage is quite normal because viruses nearly always cause other health conditions.

02:01.000 --> 02:06.000
Measles, for example, causes pneumonia, dehydration and encephalitis.

02:06.000 --> 02:10.000
HIV causes pneumonia and cardiovascular disease.

02:10.000 --> 02:14.000
The Ebola virus causes haemorrhaging and malaria.

02:14.000 --> 02:19.000
And as we know, Covid-19 causes pneumonia and cardiac arrhythmia.

02:19.000 --> 02:24.000
On top of that, a third of Americans have some kind of pre-existing health condition.

02:24.000 --> 02:31.000
So it's pretty obvious that having comorbidities for any virus is the rule, not the exception.

02:31.000 --> 02:42.000
The original source of this claim seems to have been a website called The Virus Truth, which, as you can guess from the title, is a blog specifically designed to spread disinformation about the virus.

02:42.000 --> 02:53.000
There's even a page on the link between 5G and Coronavirus, and a page which shows how Covid-19 is being deliberately sprayed onto door handles at Trump-owned buildings.

02:53.000 --> 03:06.000
And just to show what a weird place the internet has become, some of you probably do believe that coronavirus is being deliberately sprayed onto door handles at Trump-owned buildings, even though that's not on the website and I just made it up.

03:06.000 --> 03:18.000
Since that first blog of... No, I made up the claim about coronavirus being sprayed onto door handles. You can stop believing it now. It's not a thing, not even in conspiracy sites.

03:18.000 --> 03:21.000
Too late, it's probably already trending.

03:21.000 --> 03:31.000
Anyway, since that blog first appeared, the 6% claim has been copied and pasted verbatim all over the internet, from Twitter to Facebook to Reddit.

03:31.000 --> 03:39.000
Just to be clear, the CDC didn't quietly update the Covid number. That suggests the CDC didn't want anyone to know about it.

03:39.000 --> 03:49.000
It posts an update at the same time every week, and this one was no different. Millions of people read these posts, they're publicly available and hardly secret.

03:49.000 --> 03:53.000
And it didn't admit anything, it simply reported the facts.

03:53.000 --> 04:01.000
Admit is one of those wonderful editorial words that makes it look as though someone's been hiding something or that a previous claim has been reversed.

04:01.000 --> 04:10.000
In this case, it was neither. The CDC was simply stating facts about comorbidities and anyone could access their website to see the facts.

04:11.000 --> 04:20.000
And at the time of writing, the CDC is still stating the same facts in its weekly updates, and that particular figure is still 6%.

04:20.000 --> 04:35.000
Before I move on, it is a tad unorthodox for the President of a country to get important medical information from a tweet, given that he has a team of experts, including the head of the CDC itself, on call day or night to explain the facts.

04:35.000 --> 04:49.000
But formulating US policy on the basis of something someone copied from a blog to a tweet has become so normal now, I'm sure a lot of people would think it churlish and un-American for me to even mention it. Sorry.

04:49.000 --> 04:55.000
Let's face the fact that that's now perfectly normal in the United States and get back to the fact checking.

04:55.000 --> 05:03.000
Critics who are determined not to blame Covid-19 for these deaths, don't ask me why, also tried another tack.

05:03.000 --> 05:11.000
Just because people died with Covid-19, they say, that doesn't mean they died of or from Covid-19.

05:11.000 --> 05:18.000
Maybe it was the pre-existing condition that killed them. After all, people die of diabetes and heart failure every day.

05:18.000 --> 05:25.000
Or maybe they've been shot or killed in a car crash and just happen to have Covid at the same time, so Covid gets the blame.

05:25.000 --> 05:31.000
This is true to a certain extent. A small percentage of those cases might have died anyway.

05:31.000 --> 05:39.000
But in the case of shootings and car crashes, that number is known because they show up as a comorbidity under this listing.

05:39.000 --> 05:44.000
Intentional and unintentional injury, poisoning and other adverse events.

05:44.000 --> 05:52.000
They number just 6,800 out of 201,000 deaths at the time of writing, just over 3%.

05:52.000 --> 05:57.000
And it's also pretty easy to quantify how many people would have died regardless of the pandemic,

05:57.000 --> 06:02.000
because all you have to do is look at the average number of deaths over the previous five years.

06:02.000 --> 06:07.000
For example, in New York City the death rate remains pretty constant.

06:07.000 --> 06:14.000
It rose in September 2001, for obvious reasons, and it rises slightly during each winter flu season.

06:14.000 --> 06:20.000
But in the absence of a pandemic or a terrorist attack, it's pretty constant.

06:20.000 --> 06:25.000
So it's not hard to predict how many people would die in an ordinary year.

06:25.000 --> 06:34.000
But for some reason, when New York was hit by the Covid-19 pandemic, the number of deaths suddenly shot up. Coincidence?

06:34.000 --> 06:41.000
So the critics have come up with another argument. Maybe these extra deaths were connected to the pandemic in a different way.

06:41.000 --> 06:46.000
Maybe they're caused by suicide. You know, people were depressed because of lockdown.

06:46.000 --> 06:50.000
Well firstly, no, because again that would show up in the figures.

06:50.000 --> 06:57.000
People usually commit suicide by shooting themselves in the head, or hanging themselves, or jumping off bridges.

06:57.000 --> 07:04.000
So while that might explain some of the deaths attributed to Covid, in the 3-4% of intentional injury category,

07:04.000 --> 07:09.000
that still leaves around 97% of Covid deaths that aren't due to suicide.

07:09.000 --> 07:15.000
People don't normally commit suicide through obesity, and if they did it would take time.

07:15.000 --> 07:20.000
Secondly, there's not always a correlation between excess deaths and lockdowns.

07:20.000 --> 07:25.000
Sweden, for example, didn't lockdown, while Norway, Finland and Denmark did.

07:25.000 --> 07:31.000
But Sweden had far more extra deaths during the pandemic than its Scandinavian neighbours.

07:31.000 --> 07:36.000
So here's another one. One poster suggested that all these people died of old age.

07:36.000 --> 07:43.000
Her logic was that there were 13 million more old people in 2019 compared to 2010.

07:43.000 --> 07:46.000
More old people, more deaths.

07:46.000 --> 07:50.000
Look, it's always worth considering other options.

07:50.000 --> 07:54.000
But the number of elderly people goes up by several million every year.

07:54.000 --> 07:59.000
I wonder why they would suddenly all die at a time when there's a deadly pandemic.

07:59.000 --> 08:04.000
Again, coincidence. It's like saying that 200 people didn't die in a plane crash,

08:04.000 --> 08:08.000
they just happened to die of old age at the time the plane was crashing.

08:08.000 --> 08:14.000
There comes a point at which you have to say, look guys, give it up, it's a pandemic.

08:14.000 --> 08:20.000
The more outlandish the excuses you dream up to avoid that fact, the sillier they look.

08:20.000 --> 08:27.000
By the way, I also got a lot of posts from people who argued that mistakenly saying the 3.4% figure was false

08:27.000 --> 08:33.000
doesn't matter because the CFR was irrelevant and the more important figure was the IFR.

08:33.000 --> 08:37.000
That's certainly true now, as far as the public is concerned,

08:37.000 --> 08:44.000
but of course that 3.4% figure was released on March 3, at a time when an accurate IFR wasn't known.

08:44.000 --> 08:52.000
As was explained at the time, the CFR was just a crude number as a way of estimating how dangerous this new virus might be.

08:52.000 --> 08:58.000
Since then, we've had more infection fatality rate figures and they've become more accurate.

08:59.000 --> 09:06.000
So over the last 8 months, it's the IFR that's been more widely used in the media, not the CFR.

09:06.000 --> 09:12.000
However, the CFR is still an important measure for epidemiologists, health officials and hospital doctors.

09:12.000 --> 09:17.000
It helps them estimate how many patients who get admitted to hospital might die,

09:17.000 --> 09:21.000
and it lets them know how effectively these patients are being treated.

09:22.000 --> 09:25.000
Now onto the question I have about the future of this channel.

09:25.000 --> 09:29.000
A lot of people say they're not getting notifications of new videos,

09:29.000 --> 09:36.000
and I'm told by others that YouTube algorithms are favouring monetized videos that bring in revenue for YouTube.

09:36.000 --> 09:40.000
And of course my channel isn't monetized. I don't make a penny out of this.

09:40.000 --> 09:47.000
I love the way that baffles critics who are determined to show that I must somehow be profiting from these videos.

09:47.000 --> 09:49.000
I don't know why they think that matters anyway.

09:49.000 --> 09:55.000
But the other reason I do it is because I don't like to impose those annoying ads at the beginning of each video.

09:55.000 --> 10:03.000
That now has to be outweighed by the fact that I'm getting sidelined by YouTube because of my failure to monetize the channel.

10:03.000 --> 10:08.000
So what I'd like to know is, will monetizing the channel help promote my videos?

10:08.000 --> 10:13.000
Would advertisements put people off? What are the pros and cons?

10:13.000 --> 10:17.000
And what's involved in monetization if you've done that on your channel?

10:18.000 --> 10:22.000
Also, how feasible is it to pay the income I'd get directly to a third party,

10:22.000 --> 10:27.000
because I'd like to give the proceeds directly to Health in Harmony, the charity I support.

10:27.000 --> 10:29.000
Any thoughts?

10:29.000 --> 10:33.000
And of course, I look forward to your comments on the video itself.
