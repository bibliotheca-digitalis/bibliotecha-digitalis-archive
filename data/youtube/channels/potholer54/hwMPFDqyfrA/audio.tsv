0	3600	Now here's an interesting thing I read in the blog, Louder with Crowder.
3600	6480	You know how pompous people with their Nissan leaves and...
6480	11120	It tells me I apparently know that electric cars are driven by pompous people
11120	15200	with a sense of entitlement, who believe they're saving the planet
15200	18320	and think they're better than me because they care more.
18320	19040	Do I know that?
19040	20400	Uh-huh. Show them this.
20400	24000	This turns out to be a video which Louder with Crowder assures us...
24000	26560	...using things like science, facts and math...
26560	28240	...and it comes from a university.
28960	31040	Well, that sounds like a reliable source...
31040	35360	The great people at Prager University have shown, with illustrations,
35360	38640	the people who drive electric cars and think they're saving the planet
38640	41360	are in fact borderline functionally retarded.
41360	46080	Okay, just a reminder, Prager University is not a university,
46080	48720	it's a YouTube channel just like mine.
48720	52800	So like my channel, you have to check where its information comes from,
52800	54880	however good its illustrations.
55200	58000	I was going to include this in part two of my series,
58000	60240	A Conservative Solution to Climate Change.
60720	65040	But pulling the PragerU video apart was such a fascinating journey
65040	67200	that I'm posting it separately.
67200	69120	You'll have to wait a bit longer for part two.
69760	73200	Like most Prager University courses, as they're called,
73200	78160	this is basically just a five-minute video presented here by Bjorn Lomborg.
78160	80800	Do electric cars really help the environment?
80800	82640	President Obama thinks so.
82880	85760	So does Leonardo DiCaprio, and many others.
85760	89280	But since the physics of car emissions is a scientific issue,
89280	91760	not a political or a thespian one,
91760	95600	isn't the more important point that scientists think so.
95600	100720	The energy efficiency of cars is not based on the beliefs of left-wing actors and politicians,
100720	102960	but meticulous scientific studies.
103520	108720	So instead of watching the unequal fight of Lomborg taking on Obama and DiCaprio,
109680	113200	let's put him in the ring with some actual scientific research
113200	115600	and see how his claims stand up to scrutiny.
116960	119920	First, there's the energy needed to produce the car.
120560	124720	More than a third of the lifetime carbon dioxide emissions from an electric car
124720	128080	comes from the energy used to make the car itself.
128080	128800	This is true.
129360	133920	Making an electric car uses more energy than making a gasoline-powered car,
133920	137840	mainly because the making of a battery is very energy-intensive.
138640	142880	So researchers look at the lifetime carbon footprint of an electric car,
142880	145840	including production, driving usage, and scrapping.
146480	149600	Around one third of the carbon footprint, sometimes more,
149600	153920	can be taken up in just making the vehicle, as Lomborg rightly points out.
154960	160400	What Lomborg doesn't tell us is how that compares to the production of a gasoline-powered car.
160400	161520	So let's take a look.
162560	167760	Turns out that only one tenth of the gasoline car's carbon footprint comes from production,
168000	169280	which sounds good.
169280	171200	So why doesn't Lomborg mention it?
172000	174800	Well, because the reason for the smaller ratio
174800	179280	is that gasoline cars use a huge amount of energy just being driven around.
180240	183680	So despite the smaller amount of energy used in manufacture,
183680	188240	gasoline cars have a much higher overall carbon footprint than electric cars.
188960	191280	Diesel cars are much more fuel-efficient,
191280	196000	but even that doesn't bring their overall carbon footprint below electric cars.
196000	201440	While it's true that electric cars don't run on gasoline, they do run on electricity,
201440	206320	which in the US is often produced by another fossil fuel, coal.
206320	212880	As green venture capitalist Vinod Khosla likes to point out, electric cars are coal-powered cars.
213600	219440	That would be true if all the electricity they use comes from coal, but of course it doesn't.
219440	224320	In the United States, some grids have a high coal component, others have none at all.
225120	229920	And for the national average, coal fuels less than a third of America's electricity.
230800	233920	The most popular electric car, the Nissan Leaf,
233920	238880	over a 90,000 mile lifetime will emit 31 metric tonnes of CO2.
239600	245760	A comparable Mercedes CDI A160 over a similar lifetime will emit just three
245760	250560	tonnes more across its production, diesel consumption and ultimate scrapping.
250560	253600	That's close to a 10% difference, which is not much.
254240	258160	So, as always, we have to ask, where do Lomborg's figures come from?
259040	260880	PragerU doesn't tell us.
260880	266560	Unlike my channel, where all my sources are cited, you rarely find citations at PragerU,
266560	269360	just a lot of advertising for their social media sites.
270000	273600	I don't know why they don't want to tell you where their information comes from,
273600	276000	but it means you can't check and verify it.
276640	278800	So I emailed Lomborg to ask him.
279760	283840	His office told me his source is this paper by Hawkins et al,
283840	289040	and right up top the abstract shows not a 10% difference, as Lomborg says,
289040	291600	but a range from 10% to 24%.
293040	298560	The authors later issued a corrigendum, and that figure was corrected to between 17% and 30%,
299200	301280	which is even further from Lomborg's claim.
302080	306080	The first thing that comes to mind is that Lomborg cherry-picked the figures,
306080	308320	but I can't say that without reading the study.
309520	313040	Okay, I've read the study, and yep, he cherry-picked the figures.
313840	318160	First of all, Lomborg has adjusted the figures to take account of America's greater reliance
318160	323360	on coal as a fuel for electricity, compared to the average European fuel mix
323360	325280	on which the study was based.
325280	326240	That's fair enough.
326960	331120	What he didn't do was adjust the fuel efficiency of the European cars
331120	334640	to take account of the lower fuel efficiency in the USA,
334640	337120	which would have made the electric cars look greener.
337840	339840	And here's where the cherry-picking comes in.
340560	344560	Turns out that when the paper looked at the crucial area of fuel consumption,
344560	349360	it didn't just make one comparison with the electric car, it made two.
349360	352000	One for diesel, the other for gasoline.
352000	357440	But the gasoline car miraculously disappears when Lomborg does his own calculations.
358080	358400	Why?
358960	364800	Presumably because even in fuel-efficient Europe, diesel cars have much better fuel economy,
364800	369920	in this case around 53 miles to the gallon combined city and highway driving,
369920	373360	and therefore emit far fewer lifetime CO2 emissions.
374320	378240	I did email Lomborg's office again asking why he had ignored the comparison
378240	383040	with the gasoline car, and I was stunned by this reply from his media manager.
383920	387600	I'm sure many drivers of different cars would want whatever vehicle they drive
387600	390080	to be included in an analysis.
390080	393840	However, comparison of one fossil fuel and one electric car
393840	397200	is the simplest and clearest way of highlighting their differences.
398160	403600	Anyone who understands basic science or data analysis must be face-palming right now.
404320	408400	Yes, I'm sure drivers of different cars would want whatever vehicle they drive
408400	413360	to be included in the analysis, but we're not dealing with drivers of different cars
413360	414640	or what they want.
414640	418880	We're dealing with a scientific study that made two comparisons.
418880	422560	Lomborg picked the one that came closest to supporting his conclusion
422560	424160	and ignored the one that didn't.
424800	427920	This is the lamest excuse for cherry-picking I've ever read.
428800	432800	If you don't understand how wrong that is, it would be like me claiming that
432800	439200	65% of US electricity comes from renewable resources, citing this study as my source.
439920	443840	I'm sure Lomborg would be the first to say this is an absurd claim
443840	448320	and accuse me of cherry-picking just one grid and ignoring the rest.
448320	450720	Would it be a legitimate excuse to say,
450720	455920	I'm sure many people would want whatever grid they're connected to included in an analysis,
455920	458800	but it's simpler and clearer to use just one.
459520	462560	Cherry-picking just one comparison may be simple,
462560	467040	but that makes it very unclear that the other comparison in the study
467040	469040	is screaming a very different result.
470240	473360	If it is simpler and clearer to choose just one,
473360	475840	the obvious choice would have been the gasoline car.
476720	481040	After all, only around 5% of Americans drive diesel cars,
481040	485200	and even though the gasoline car gets 42 miles to the gallon combined,
485200	488800	which is way more than most similar-sized American cars,
488800	493280	at least it's closer than the diesel's 53 miles to the gallon combined.
493280	498080	Better yet, adjust the fuel economy to an average of what most Americans drive.
498080	502960	I checked the EPA's annual fuel economy list for new small and hatchback cars,
502960	508320	and most gasoline vehicles in the USA are around or under 30 miles to the gallon combined,
508880	515120	so they're emitting around twice as much CO2 as the diesel comparison that Lomborg cherry-picked.
515120	520400	Then he goes on to make another comparison for larger cars, and again picks a diesel.
520400	525040	The results are similar for a top-line Tesla, the king of electric cars.
525040	531920	It emits about 44 tons, which is only five tons less than a similar Audi A7 Quattro.
531920	533360	That's a difference of about 10%.
534480	540160	PragerU cites no source, but USA Today gives us a link in Lomborg's opinion piece
540160	545040	where the same claim is made, and this was confirmed by Lomborg's office as his source.
545760	548800	But the links just take you to this government website,
548800	551200	listing the fuel economies of the two cars.
551760	555200	So let's see what actual published studies have found.
556400	561440	The Union of Concerned Scientists made a cradle-to-grave emissions study in the USA.
561440	568480	It found that gasoline cars emit 29 tons more CO2 equivalents than mid-size electric cars,
568480	572880	powered by an electricity grid mix representative of where those cars are sold,
573520	575680	and 54 tons for large cars.
576320	580400	That's 51% and 53% lower, respectively.
581280	586560	It's important to point out that where the cars are sold is not the same as the grid average,
586560	588960	and it brings me back to that all-important point.
589600	594800	The carbon footprint of electric cars depends on the fuel mix of the grid where they're charged,
594800	597360	and the fuel mix of the grid where the batteries are made.
598000	603200	The UCS study shows that different US grids have markedly different fuel mixes.
604400	608400	Even where a grid has a high component of coal-fueled electricity,
608400	613280	the car can still have a low carbon footprint by being produced and charged off-grid.
614160	619840	Tesla, for example, is building huge battery manufacturing plants in Nevada and China,
619840	621360	powered by solar energy.
622640	630560	As for charging off-grid, the UCS study cited a 2013 survey showing that 32% of respondents
630560	637200	who bought electric cars had solar panels on their roofs, and 16% intended to install them.
637760	640480	Another factor is urban versus highway driving.
641040	646320	The gap between gasoline and electric is much larger in cities, for various reasons.
646320	650720	For one thing, gasoline cars use a lot of energy just idling in traffic.
651520	657520	Another cradle-to-grave study done in France found that a small electric car emits 63%
657520	662080	less carbon dioxide than a gasoline car, from production to scrapping,
662080	664800	and 70% if the cars are recycled.
665360	671360	For a larger electric car compared to a larger diesel car, the difference is 44% to 57%.
672320	676160	That's a saving of between 21 and 20 tons of carbon dioxide.
676960	680880	But again, the study's results reflect the mix of fuels used.
680880	684480	In France, most electrical energy is nuclear-powered,
684480	690800	so electric cars there are much greener than they would be in Estonia, which is mostly coal-powered.
690880	695920	But remember Vinod Khosla's observation. Electric cars are coal-powered cars.
695920	701440	But we've already established that this observation is not an observation. It's a fallacy.
701440	704560	Yes, it might be powered by coal, proponents will say.
704560	709040	No, proponents of electric cars would not say that if they'd read any of the studies.
709040	712720	They'd say that most electric cars are partially powered by coal.
713280	716640	And they'd point out that many aren't powered by coal at all.
716640	721440	But unlike the regular car, coal plant emissions are far away from city centers,
721440	725520	where most people live, and where damage from air pollution is greatest.
725520	729040	New research in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences
729040	732160	found that while gasoline cars pollute closer to home,
732720	736240	coal firepower actually pollutes more. A lot more.
736880	744480	How much more? Well, the researchers estimate that if the U.S. has 10% more gasoline cars in 2020,
744480	748640	870 more people will die each year from the additional air pollution.
749280	755360	If the U.S. has 10% more electric vehicles powered on the average U.S. electricity mix,
755360	760560	1617 more people will die every year from the extra pollution.
760560	764320	Matching the figures Lomborg uses with the name of the journal he gives,
764320	768480	I think he's talking about this 2014 paper by Tessam et al.
769280	772880	If so, he's absolutely right. That's what the paper found.
773520	778960	But that's still not the whole story, because if burning more coal leads to more deaths,
778960	783360	then surely burning less coal would lead to fewer deaths, wouldn't it?
783360	788640	And the Tessam study found exactly that. The red circle in the middle shows the number of deaths
788640	794320	from a 10% increase in electric cars if that electricity is sourced by the average U.S.
794320	798160	fuel mix, compared to gasoline, circled in red at the top.
798960	803520	As Lomborg correctly reports, that's 1617 more deaths.
804240	809600	But the researchers also concluded that if natural gas was the source of that electricity,
809600	814720	shown by the red circle near the bottom, there'd be less than 500 extra deaths.
814720	818880	That's far fewer than the 870 deaths from gasoline-driven cars.
819760	824400	Better yet, the authors found that if electric cars sourced their energy from renewables,
824400	828480	wind, water, and solar, the number of deaths would be cut even further,
828480	832880	to less than 200. Most of that coming from emissions during production.
833760	837520	So if we're worried about deaths caused by coal-burning power stations,
837520	841440	the obvious solution is to replace them with cleaner energy sources.
842160	845440	That's already happening. Which brings us to the next question.
846080	851520	Won't the perceived rapid ramp-up of these renewables make future electric cars much cleaner?
852400	855280	Unfortunately, this is mostly wishful thinking.
855280	860240	Today, the U.S. gets 14% of its electric power from renewables.
860240	863920	In 25 years, Obama's Energy Information Administration
863920	869680	estimates that number will have gone up just 3 percentage points to 17%.
869680	873840	I don't know why Obama's name keeps popping up, because this is supposed to be a scientific
873840	879280	question. But just to clarify, this isn't Obama's Energy Information Administration,
879280	884160	it's a Federal Statistics and Analysis Office that's been operating under seven different
884160	888080	presidents of both political parties and is still going strong today.
888800	893680	And it shows that the United States is already getting 17% of its electricity
893680	897760	from renewable energy. And that's just the U.S. average,
897760	902080	which includes areas that have little interest in renewable energy and no targets.
902960	907200	If we look at the states that do, many of them are looking at renewable targets of
907200	912960	20 to 30%, well before 2040. So getting energy from renewables
912960	917280	is not wishful thinking in places where it's being actively pursued.
917280	921920	It's only wishful thinking in places that do nothing except wishfully think.
922640	926160	But that's not the whole story on how emissions are coming down.
926160	929360	Listen carefully to Lomborg's choice of words as he continues.
929920	935280	Meanwhile, those fossil fuels that generate 65% of U.S. electricity today
935280	942240	will still generate about 64% of it in 2040. So it sounds as though coal will still be
942240	945680	generating the same amount of electricity as it does today.
945680	951600	But Lomborg doesn't use the word coal here. He refers to fossil fuels, which is odd because
951600	956720	there are two main fossil fuels generating electricity, coal and natural gas.
956720	962800	And the EIA always differentiates between them. So why did Lomborg suddenly change the EIA's
962800	967600	classification here and lump them together? It might have something to do with the fact
967600	970400	that these fuels have very different emissions profiles.
971040	975840	Natural gas is a lot less polluting and releases far less CO2 than coal.
976400	981760	So if the mix of fossil fuels changes, that would affect the carbon footprint of electric cars
981760	984480	just as much as changing the percentage of renewables.
985280	990480	So let's look at the figures. The 2015 EIA report, the latest one
990480	997200	available to Lomborg when he made this video, shows that in 2013 coal comprised 39% of the
997200	1002240	total. That's the dark grey. Natural gas in red was at 27%.
1003360	1008640	The same report predicted that by 2040 the proportion of coal would fall to 34%
1009440	1014880	and natural gas would rise to 31%. So by lumping them together,
1014880	1020000	Lomborg can make it look as though nothing is changing. The overall percentage stays the same.
1020720	1024320	But that disguises the fact that because of the changing mix,
1024320	1028160	these fossil fuels will produce less CO2 and be a lot cleaner.
1028880	1031920	It's on top of that that we have the rise in renewable energy.
1033120	1037760	Even those projections are now obsolete. According to the latest EIA report,
1037760	1043120	coal has already fallen way below 34%, 22 years ahead of prediction.
1043680	1049600	Natural gas has already surpassed 31%. So the fossil fuel mix has already shifted
1049600	1054320	in favour of lower CO2 emissions. Lomborg's next complaint is about
1054320	1057840	the making of the electric car itself, especially the battery.
1058720	1062640	The mining of lithium, for instance, is not a green activity.
1062640	1066240	That's true. Lithium mining does a lot of environmental damage.
1066800	1072720	Just look at this lithium mine in South America. As well as the horrendous scar on the landscape
1072720	1077200	that you can see, what you can't see is the water taken to extract the lithium,
1077200	1082560	which leads to depletion from local farms. In Tibet, chemicals used in lithium extraction
1082560	1087840	have leaked into rivers, killing fish. Tailings from lithium mines worldwide
1087840	1090720	blot the landscape and contaminate the water table.
1091520	1095760	Clearly Lomborg's right. Lithium mining is not a green activity.
1097280	1102560	But of course neither is oil sand mining to make gasoline, or oil shale mining,
1102560	1108160	or oil extraction by other means, like in-situ oil shale extraction and oil drilling,
1108160	1112880	or like the transport of oil. Oil leakage and spills also contaminate
1112880	1117920	water supplies and kill fish. Oil pipelines are a blot on the landscape
1117920	1122800	and block animal migration routes. Is the environmental damage done by oil
1122800	1125920	worse than lithium? That would be useful to know.
1125920	1128960	But for some reason, Lomborg only mentions lithium.
1129600	1133200	While electric car owners may cruise around feeling virtuous.
1133200	1139920	OK, again, personal feelings towards electric car owners are irrelevant because that's not science.
1139920	1145200	Whether you feel people who drive electric cars are feeling virtuous, or pompous, or driving with
1145200	1150640	a sense of entitlement, that shouldn't be a factor in deciding whether electric cars are greener than
1150640	1156000	gasoline cars. It's possible these people drive electric cars because they're great value for
1156000	1162160	money. Even without tax breaks, electric car prices have come down so fast and are so cheap
1162160	1167840	to run that owners have simply done the math. According to an article in Forbes magazine,
1167840	1172080	once you figure in the cost of ownership, especially maintenance and fuel,
1172080	1175520	electric vehicles are a bargain despite the upfront price tag.
1176080	1180400	If you buy an electric vehicle rather than a gasoline-powered one, you're probably going
1180400	1185120	to save a lot of money during the time you own it. You don't need to be a member of the Sierra
1185120	1190560	Club to see the appeal of going electric. So maybe these buyers aren't borderline
1190560	1195040	functionally retarded, maybe they've just gone through the figures and are smart enough to
1195040	1201040	understand basic economics. But even if electric car owners did have some sort of personality
1201040	1206480	disorder that makes them feel virtuous or entitled, however much Lomborg, Crowder,
1206480	1212160	or Kirchhoff may dislike that, it's still no excuse for misrepresenting scientific facts.
1213120	1218320	While researching articles about electric cars, I was struck by how many of the negative ones
1218320	1223600	were either written by Lomborg or were simply copies of his claims by people who hadn't
1223600	1229440	bothered to check his facts. Time to stop worshipping the electric car by Bjorn Lomborg.
1230080	1236400	Green cars have a dirty little secret by Bjorn Lomborg. Electric car benefits, just myths,
1236480	1242480	by Bjorn Lomborg. Don't be fooled, Elon Musk's electric cars aren't about to save the planet,
1242480	1248960	it's by Bjorn Lomborg. So Lomborg's war on electric cars has been going on for five years now,
1248960	1253680	which would be fine if he could support his premise that they're not environmentally friendly.
1253680	1257360	But if the only way he can do that is to make incorrect statements,
1257360	1261120	omit information, and cherry-pick, then why?
