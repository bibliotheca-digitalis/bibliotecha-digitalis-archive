00:00.000 --> 00:03.600
Now here's an interesting thing I read in the blog, Louder with Crowder.

00:03.600 --> 00:06.480
You know how pompous people with their Nissan leaves and...

00:06.480 --> 00:11.120
It tells me I apparently know that electric cars are driven by pompous people

00:11.120 --> 00:15.200
with a sense of entitlement, who believe they're saving the planet

00:15.200 --> 00:18.320
and think they're better than me because they care more.

00:18.320 --> 00:19.040
Do I know that?

00:19.040 --> 00:20.400
Uh-huh. Show them this.

00:20.400 --> 00:24.000
This turns out to be a video which Louder with Crowder assures us...

00:24.000 --> 00:26.560
...using things like science, facts and math...

00:26.560 --> 00:28.240
...and it comes from a university.

00:28.960 --> 00:31.040
Well, that sounds like a reliable source...

00:31.040 --> 00:35.360
The great people at Prager University have shown, with illustrations,

00:35.360 --> 00:38.640
the people who drive electric cars and think they're saving the planet

00:38.640 --> 00:41.360
are in fact borderline functionally retarded.

00:41.360 --> 00:46.080
Okay, just a reminder, Prager University is not a university,

00:46.080 --> 00:48.720
it's a YouTube channel just like mine.

00:48.720 --> 00:52.800
So like my channel, you have to check where its information comes from,

00:52.800 --> 00:54.880
however good its illustrations.

00:55.200 --> 00:58.000
I was going to include this in part two of my series,

00:58.000 --> 01:00.240
A Conservative Solution to Climate Change.

01:00.720 --> 01:05.040
But pulling the PragerU video apart was such a fascinating journey

01:05.040 --> 01:07.200
that I'm posting it separately.

01:07.200 --> 01:09.120
You'll have to wait a bit longer for part two.

01:09.760 --> 01:13.200
Like most Prager University courses, as they're called,

01:13.200 --> 01:18.160
this is basically just a five-minute video presented here by Bjorn Lomborg.

01:18.160 --> 01:20.800
Do electric cars really help the environment?

01:20.800 --> 01:22.640
President Obama thinks so.

01:22.880 --> 01:25.760
So does Leonardo DiCaprio, and many others.

01:25.760 --> 01:29.280
But since the physics of car emissions is a scientific issue,

01:29.280 --> 01:31.760
not a political or a thespian one,

01:31.760 --> 01:35.600
isn't the more important point that scientists think so.

01:35.600 --> 01:40.720
The energy efficiency of cars is not based on the beliefs of left-wing actors and politicians,

01:40.720 --> 01:42.960
but meticulous scientific studies.

01:43.520 --> 01:48.720
So instead of watching the unequal fight of Lomborg taking on Obama and DiCaprio,

01:49.680 --> 01:53.200
let's put him in the ring with some actual scientific research

01:53.200 --> 01:55.600
and see how his claims stand up to scrutiny.

01:56.960 --> 01:59.920
First, there's the energy needed to produce the car.

02:00.560 --> 02:04.720
More than a third of the lifetime carbon dioxide emissions from an electric car

02:04.720 --> 02:08.080
comes from the energy used to make the car itself.

02:08.080 --> 02:08.800
This is true.

02:09.360 --> 02:13.920
Making an electric car uses more energy than making a gasoline-powered car,

02:13.920 --> 02:17.840
mainly because the making of a battery is very energy-intensive.

02:18.640 --> 02:22.880
So researchers look at the lifetime carbon footprint of an electric car,

02:22.880 --> 02:25.840
including production, driving usage, and scrapping.

02:26.480 --> 02:29.600
Around one third of the carbon footprint, sometimes more,

02:29.600 --> 02:33.920
can be taken up in just making the vehicle, as Lomborg rightly points out.

02:34.960 --> 02:40.400
What Lomborg doesn't tell us is how that compares to the production of a gasoline-powered car.

02:40.400 --> 02:41.520
So let's take a look.

02:42.560 --> 02:47.760
Turns out that only one tenth of the gasoline car's carbon footprint comes from production,

02:48.000 --> 02:49.280
which sounds good.

02:49.280 --> 02:51.200
So why doesn't Lomborg mention it?

02:52.000 --> 02:54.800
Well, because the reason for the smaller ratio

02:54.800 --> 02:59.280
is that gasoline cars use a huge amount of energy just being driven around.

03:00.240 --> 03:03.680
So despite the smaller amount of energy used in manufacture,

03:03.680 --> 03:08.240
gasoline cars have a much higher overall carbon footprint than electric cars.

03:08.960 --> 03:11.280
Diesel cars are much more fuel-efficient,

03:11.280 --> 03:16.000
but even that doesn't bring their overall carbon footprint below electric cars.

03:16.000 --> 03:21.440
While it's true that electric cars don't run on gasoline, they do run on electricity,

03:21.440 --> 03:26.320
which in the US is often produced by another fossil fuel, coal.

03:26.320 --> 03:32.880
As green venture capitalist Vinod Khosla likes to point out, electric cars are coal-powered cars.

03:33.600 --> 03:39.440
That would be true if all the electricity they use comes from coal, but of course it doesn't.

03:39.440 --> 03:44.320
In the United States, some grids have a high coal component, others have none at all.

03:45.120 --> 03:49.920
And for the national average, coal fuels less than a third of America's electricity.

03:50.800 --> 03:53.920
The most popular electric car, the Nissan Leaf,

03:53.920 --> 03:58.880
over a 90,000 mile lifetime will emit 31 metric tonnes of CO2.

03:59.600 --> 04:05.760
A comparable Mercedes CDI A160 over a similar lifetime will emit just three

04:05.760 --> 04:10.560
tonnes more across its production, diesel consumption and ultimate scrapping.

04:10.560 --> 04:13.600
That's close to a 10% difference, which is not much.

04:14.240 --> 04:18.160
So, as always, we have to ask, where do Lomborg's figures come from?

04:19.040 --> 04:20.880
PragerU doesn't tell us.

04:20.880 --> 04:26.560
Unlike my channel, where all my sources are cited, you rarely find citations at PragerU,

04:26.560 --> 04:29.360
just a lot of advertising for their social media sites.

04:30.000 --> 04:33.600
I don't know why they don't want to tell you where their information comes from,

04:33.600 --> 04:36.000
but it means you can't check and verify it.

04:36.640 --> 04:38.800
So I emailed Lomborg to ask him.

04:39.760 --> 04:43.840
His office told me his source is this paper by Hawkins et al,

04:43.840 --> 04:49.040
and right up top the abstract shows not a 10% difference, as Lomborg says,

04:49.040 --> 04:51.600
but a range from 10% to 24%.

04:53.040 --> 04:58.560
The authors later issued a corrigendum, and that figure was corrected to between 17% and 30%,

04:59.200 --> 05:01.280
which is even further from Lomborg's claim.

05:02.080 --> 05:06.080
The first thing that comes to mind is that Lomborg cherry-picked the figures,

05:06.080 --> 05:08.320
but I can't say that without reading the study.

05:09.520 --> 05:13.040
Okay, I've read the study, and yep, he cherry-picked the figures.

05:13.840 --> 05:18.160
First of all, Lomborg has adjusted the figures to take account of America's greater reliance

05:18.160 --> 05:23.360
on coal as a fuel for electricity, compared to the average European fuel mix

05:23.360 --> 05:25.280
on which the study was based.

05:25.280 --> 05:26.240
That's fair enough.

05:26.960 --> 05:31.120
What he didn't do was adjust the fuel efficiency of the European cars

05:31.120 --> 05:34.640
to take account of the lower fuel efficiency in the USA,

05:34.640 --> 05:37.120
which would have made the electric cars look greener.

05:37.840 --> 05:39.840
And here's where the cherry-picking comes in.

05:40.560 --> 05:44.560
Turns out that when the paper looked at the crucial area of fuel consumption,

05:44.560 --> 05:49.360
it didn't just make one comparison with the electric car, it made two.

05:49.360 --> 05:52.000
One for diesel, the other for gasoline.

05:52.000 --> 05:57.440
But the gasoline car miraculously disappears when Lomborg does his own calculations.

05:58.080 --> 05:58.400
Why?

05:58.960 --> 06:04.800
Presumably because even in fuel-efficient Europe, diesel cars have much better fuel economy,

06:04.800 --> 06:09.920
in this case around 53 miles to the gallon combined city and highway driving,

06:09.920 --> 06:13.360
and therefore emit far fewer lifetime CO2 emissions.

06:14.320 --> 06:18.240
I did email Lomborg's office again asking why he had ignored the comparison

06:18.240 --> 06:23.040
with the gasoline car, and I was stunned by this reply from his media manager.

06:23.920 --> 06:27.600
I'm sure many drivers of different cars would want whatever vehicle they drive

06:27.600 --> 06:30.080
to be included in an analysis.

06:30.080 --> 06:33.840
However, comparison of one fossil fuel and one electric car

06:33.840 --> 06:37.200
is the simplest and clearest way of highlighting their differences.

06:38.160 --> 06:43.600
Anyone who understands basic science or data analysis must be face-palming right now.

06:44.320 --> 06:48.400
Yes, I'm sure drivers of different cars would want whatever vehicle they drive

06:48.400 --> 06:53.360
to be included in the analysis, but we're not dealing with drivers of different cars

06:53.360 --> 06:54.640
or what they want.

06:54.640 --> 06:58.880
We're dealing with a scientific study that made two comparisons.

06:58.880 --> 07:02.560
Lomborg picked the one that came closest to supporting his conclusion

07:02.560 --> 07:04.160
and ignored the one that didn't.

07:04.800 --> 07:07.920
This is the lamest excuse for cherry-picking I've ever read.

07:08.800 --> 07:12.800
If you don't understand how wrong that is, it would be like me claiming that

07:12.800 --> 07:19.200
65% of US electricity comes from renewable resources, citing this study as my source.

07:19.920 --> 07:23.840
I'm sure Lomborg would be the first to say this is an absurd claim

07:23.840 --> 07:28.320
and accuse me of cherry-picking just one grid and ignoring the rest.

07:28.320 --> 07:30.720
Would it be a legitimate excuse to say,

07:30.720 --> 07:35.920
I'm sure many people would want whatever grid they're connected to included in an analysis,

07:35.920 --> 07:38.800
but it's simpler and clearer to use just one.

07:39.520 --> 07:42.560
Cherry-picking just one comparison may be simple,

07:42.560 --> 07:47.040
but that makes it very unclear that the other comparison in the study

07:47.040 --> 07:49.040
is screaming a very different result.

07:50.240 --> 07:53.360
If it is simpler and clearer to choose just one,

07:53.360 --> 07:55.840
the obvious choice would have been the gasoline car.

07:56.720 --> 08:01.040
After all, only around 5% of Americans drive diesel cars,

08:01.040 --> 08:05.200
and even though the gasoline car gets 42 miles to the gallon combined,

08:05.200 --> 08:08.800
which is way more than most similar-sized American cars,

08:08.800 --> 08:13.280
at least it's closer than the diesel's 53 miles to the gallon combined.

08:13.280 --> 08:18.080
Better yet, adjust the fuel economy to an average of what most Americans drive.

08:18.080 --> 08:22.960
I checked the EPA's annual fuel economy list for new small and hatchback cars,

08:22.960 --> 08:28.320
and most gasoline vehicles in the USA are around or under 30 miles to the gallon combined,

08:28.880 --> 08:35.120
so they're emitting around twice as much CO2 as the diesel comparison that Lomborg cherry-picked.

08:35.120 --> 08:40.400
Then he goes on to make another comparison for larger cars, and again picks a diesel.

08:40.400 --> 08:45.040
The results are similar for a top-line Tesla, the king of electric cars.

08:45.040 --> 08:51.920
It emits about 44 tons, which is only five tons less than a similar Audi A7 Quattro.

08:51.920 --> 08:53.360
That's a difference of about 10%.

08:54.480 --> 09:00.160
PragerU cites no source, but USA Today gives us a link in Lomborg's opinion piece

09:00.160 --> 09:05.040
where the same claim is made, and this was confirmed by Lomborg's office as his source.

09:05.760 --> 09:08.800
But the links just take you to this government website,

09:08.800 --> 09:11.200
listing the fuel economies of the two cars.

09:11.760 --> 09:15.200
So let's see what actual published studies have found.

09:16.400 --> 09:21.440
The Union of Concerned Scientists made a cradle-to-grave emissions study in the USA.

09:21.440 --> 09:28.480
It found that gasoline cars emit 29 tons more CO2 equivalents than mid-size electric cars,

09:28.480 --> 09:32.880
powered by an electricity grid mix representative of where those cars are sold,

09:33.520 --> 09:35.680
and 54 tons for large cars.

09:36.320 --> 09:40.400
That's 51% and 53% lower, respectively.

09:41.280 --> 09:46.560
It's important to point out that where the cars are sold is not the same as the grid average,

09:46.560 --> 09:48.960
and it brings me back to that all-important point.

09:49.600 --> 09:54.800
The carbon footprint of electric cars depends on the fuel mix of the grid where they're charged,

09:54.800 --> 09:57.360
and the fuel mix of the grid where the batteries are made.

09:58.000 --> 10:03.200
The UCS study shows that different US grids have markedly different fuel mixes.

10:04.400 --> 10:08.400
Even where a grid has a high component of coal-fueled electricity,

10:08.400 --> 10:13.280
the car can still have a low carbon footprint by being produced and charged off-grid.

10:14.160 --> 10:19.840
Tesla, for example, is building huge battery manufacturing plants in Nevada and China,

10:19.840 --> 10:21.360
powered by solar energy.

10:22.640 --> 10:30.560
As for charging off-grid, the UCS study cited a 2013 survey showing that 32% of respondents

10:30.560 --> 10:37.200
who bought electric cars had solar panels on their roofs, and 16% intended to install them.

10:37.760 --> 10:40.480
Another factor is urban versus highway driving.

10:41.040 --> 10:46.320
The gap between gasoline and electric is much larger in cities, for various reasons.

10:46.320 --> 10:50.720
For one thing, gasoline cars use a lot of energy just idling in traffic.

10:51.520 --> 10:57.520
Another cradle-to-grave study done in France found that a small electric car emits 63%

10:57.520 --> 11:02.080
less carbon dioxide than a gasoline car, from production to scrapping,

11:02.080 --> 11:04.800
and 70% if the cars are recycled.

11:05.360 --> 11:11.360
For a larger electric car compared to a larger diesel car, the difference is 44% to 57%.

11:12.320 --> 11:16.160
That's a saving of between 21 and 20 tons of carbon dioxide.

11:16.960 --> 11:20.880
But again, the study's results reflect the mix of fuels used.

11:20.880 --> 11:24.480
In France, most electrical energy is nuclear-powered,

11:24.480 --> 11:30.800
so electric cars there are much greener than they would be in Estonia, which is mostly coal-powered.

11:30.880 --> 11:35.920
But remember Vinod Khosla's observation. Electric cars are coal-powered cars.

11:35.920 --> 11:41.440
But we've already established that this observation is not an observation. It's a fallacy.

11:41.440 --> 11:44.560
Yes, it might be powered by coal, proponents will say.

11:44.560 --> 11:49.040
No, proponents of electric cars would not say that if they'd read any of the studies.

11:49.040 --> 11:52.720
They'd say that most electric cars are partially powered by coal.

11:53.280 --> 11:56.640
And they'd point out that many aren't powered by coal at all.

11:56.640 --> 12:01.440
But unlike the regular car, coal plant emissions are far away from city centers,

12:01.440 --> 12:05.520
where most people live, and where damage from air pollution is greatest.

12:05.520 --> 12:09.040
New research in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences

12:09.040 --> 12:12.160
found that while gasoline cars pollute closer to home,

12:12.720 --> 12:16.240
coal firepower actually pollutes more. A lot more.

12:16.880 --> 12:24.480
How much more? Well, the researchers estimate that if the U.S. has 10% more gasoline cars in 2020,

12:24.480 --> 12:28.640
870 more people will die each year from the additional air pollution.

12:29.280 --> 12:35.360
If the U.S. has 10% more electric vehicles powered on the average U.S. electricity mix,

12:35.360 --> 12:40.560
1617 more people will die every year from the extra pollution.

12:40.560 --> 12:44.320
Matching the figures Lomborg uses with the name of the journal he gives,

12:44.320 --> 12:48.480
I think he's talking about this 2014 paper by Tessam et al.

12:49.280 --> 12:52.880
If so, he's absolutely right. That's what the paper found.

12:53.520 --> 12:58.960
But that's still not the whole story, because if burning more coal leads to more deaths,

12:58.960 --> 13:03.360
then surely burning less coal would lead to fewer deaths, wouldn't it?

13:03.360 --> 13:08.640
And the Tessam study found exactly that. The red circle in the middle shows the number of deaths

13:08.640 --> 13:14.320
from a 10% increase in electric cars if that electricity is sourced by the average U.S.

13:14.320 --> 13:18.160
fuel mix, compared to gasoline, circled in red at the top.

13:18.960 --> 13:23.520
As Lomborg correctly reports, that's 1617 more deaths.

13:24.240 --> 13:29.600
But the researchers also concluded that if natural gas was the source of that electricity,

13:29.600 --> 13:34.720
shown by the red circle near the bottom, there'd be less than 500 extra deaths.

13:34.720 --> 13:38.880
That's far fewer than the 870 deaths from gasoline-driven cars.

13:39.760 --> 13:44.400
Better yet, the authors found that if electric cars sourced their energy from renewables,

13:44.400 --> 13:48.480
wind, water, and solar, the number of deaths would be cut even further,

13:48.480 --> 13:52.880
to less than 200. Most of that coming from emissions during production.

13:53.760 --> 13:57.520
So if we're worried about deaths caused by coal-burning power stations,

13:57.520 --> 14:01.440
the obvious solution is to replace them with cleaner energy sources.

14:02.160 --> 14:05.440
That's already happening. Which brings us to the next question.

14:06.080 --> 14:11.520
Won't the perceived rapid ramp-up of these renewables make future electric cars much cleaner?

14:12.400 --> 14:15.280
Unfortunately, this is mostly wishful thinking.

14:15.280 --> 14:20.240
Today, the U.S. gets 14% of its electric power from renewables.

14:20.240 --> 14:23.920
In 25 years, Obama's Energy Information Administration

14:23.920 --> 14:29.680
estimates that number will have gone up just 3 percentage points to 17%.

14:29.680 --> 14:33.840
I don't know why Obama's name keeps popping up, because this is supposed to be a scientific

14:33.840 --> 14:39.280
question. But just to clarify, this isn't Obama's Energy Information Administration,

14:39.280 --> 14:44.160
it's a Federal Statistics and Analysis Office that's been operating under seven different

14:44.160 --> 14:48.080
presidents of both political parties and is still going strong today.

14:48.800 --> 14:53.680
And it shows that the United States is already getting 17% of its electricity

14:53.680 --> 14:57.760
from renewable energy. And that's just the U.S. average,

14:57.760 --> 15:02.080
which includes areas that have little interest in renewable energy and no targets.

15:02.960 --> 15:07.200
If we look at the states that do, many of them are looking at renewable targets of

15:07.200 --> 15:12.960
20 to 30%, well before 2040. So getting energy from renewables

15:12.960 --> 15:17.280
is not wishful thinking in places where it's being actively pursued.

15:17.280 --> 15:21.920
It's only wishful thinking in places that do nothing except wishfully think.

15:22.640 --> 15:26.160
But that's not the whole story on how emissions are coming down.

15:26.160 --> 15:29.360
Listen carefully to Lomborg's choice of words as he continues.

15:29.920 --> 15:35.280
Meanwhile, those fossil fuels that generate 65% of U.S. electricity today

15:35.280 --> 15:42.240
will still generate about 64% of it in 2040. So it sounds as though coal will still be

15:42.240 --> 15:45.680
generating the same amount of electricity as it does today.

15:45.680 --> 15:51.600
But Lomborg doesn't use the word coal here. He refers to fossil fuels, which is odd because

15:51.600 --> 15:56.720
there are two main fossil fuels generating electricity, coal and natural gas.

15:56.720 --> 16:02.800
And the EIA always differentiates between them. So why did Lomborg suddenly change the EIA's

16:02.800 --> 16:07.600
classification here and lump them together? It might have something to do with the fact

16:07.600 --> 16:10.400
that these fuels have very different emissions profiles.

16:11.040 --> 16:15.840
Natural gas is a lot less polluting and releases far less CO2 than coal.

16:16.400 --> 16:21.760
So if the mix of fossil fuels changes, that would affect the carbon footprint of electric cars

16:21.760 --> 16:24.480
just as much as changing the percentage of renewables.

16:25.280 --> 16:30.480
So let's look at the figures. The 2015 EIA report, the latest one

16:30.480 --> 16:37.200
available to Lomborg when he made this video, shows that in 2013 coal comprised 39% of the

16:37.200 --> 16:42.240
total. That's the dark grey. Natural gas in red was at 27%.

16:43.360 --> 16:48.640
The same report predicted that by 2040 the proportion of coal would fall to 34%

16:49.440 --> 16:54.880
and natural gas would rise to 31%. So by lumping them together,

16:54.880 --> 17:00.000
Lomborg can make it look as though nothing is changing. The overall percentage stays the same.

17:00.720 --> 17:04.320
But that disguises the fact that because of the changing mix,

17:04.320 --> 17:08.160
these fossil fuels will produce less CO2 and be a lot cleaner.

17:08.880 --> 17:11.920
It's on top of that that we have the rise in renewable energy.

17:13.120 --> 17:17.760
Even those projections are now obsolete. According to the latest EIA report,

17:17.760 --> 17:23.120
coal has already fallen way below 34%, 22 years ahead of prediction.

17:23.680 --> 17:29.600
Natural gas has already surpassed 31%. So the fossil fuel mix has already shifted

17:29.600 --> 17:34.320
in favour of lower CO2 emissions. Lomborg's next complaint is about

17:34.320 --> 17:37.840
the making of the electric car itself, especially the battery.

17:38.720 --> 17:42.640
The mining of lithium, for instance, is not a green activity.

17:42.640 --> 17:46.240
That's true. Lithium mining does a lot of environmental damage.

17:46.800 --> 17:52.720
Just look at this lithium mine in South America. As well as the horrendous scar on the landscape

17:52.720 --> 17:57.200
that you can see, what you can't see is the water taken to extract the lithium,

17:57.200 --> 18:02.560
which leads to depletion from local farms. In Tibet, chemicals used in lithium extraction

18:02.560 --> 18:07.840
have leaked into rivers, killing fish. Tailings from lithium mines worldwide

18:07.840 --> 18:10.720
blot the landscape and contaminate the water table.

18:11.520 --> 18:15.760
Clearly Lomborg's right. Lithium mining is not a green activity.

18:17.280 --> 18:22.560
But of course neither is oil sand mining to make gasoline, or oil shale mining,

18:22.560 --> 18:28.160
or oil extraction by other means, like in-situ oil shale extraction and oil drilling,

18:28.160 --> 18:32.880
or like the transport of oil. Oil leakage and spills also contaminate

18:32.880 --> 18:37.920
water supplies and kill fish. Oil pipelines are a blot on the landscape

18:37.920 --> 18:42.800
and block animal migration routes. Is the environmental damage done by oil

18:42.800 --> 18:45.920
worse than lithium? That would be useful to know.

18:45.920 --> 18:48.960
But for some reason, Lomborg only mentions lithium.

18:49.600 --> 18:53.200
While electric car owners may cruise around feeling virtuous.

18:53.200 --> 18:59.920
OK, again, personal feelings towards electric car owners are irrelevant because that's not science.

18:59.920 --> 19:05.200
Whether you feel people who drive electric cars are feeling virtuous, or pompous, or driving with

19:05.200 --> 19:10.640
a sense of entitlement, that shouldn't be a factor in deciding whether electric cars are greener than

19:10.640 --> 19:16.000
gasoline cars. It's possible these people drive electric cars because they're great value for

19:16.000 --> 19:22.160
money. Even without tax breaks, electric car prices have come down so fast and are so cheap

19:22.160 --> 19:27.840
to run that owners have simply done the math. According to an article in Forbes magazine,

19:27.840 --> 19:32.080
once you figure in the cost of ownership, especially maintenance and fuel,

19:32.080 --> 19:35.520
electric vehicles are a bargain despite the upfront price tag.

19:36.080 --> 19:40.400
If you buy an electric vehicle rather than a gasoline-powered one, you're probably going

19:40.400 --> 19:45.120
to save a lot of money during the time you own it. You don't need to be a member of the Sierra

19:45.120 --> 19:50.560
Club to see the appeal of going electric. So maybe these buyers aren't borderline

19:50.560 --> 19:55.040
functionally retarded, maybe they've just gone through the figures and are smart enough to

19:55.040 --> 20:01.040
understand basic economics. But even if electric car owners did have some sort of personality

20:01.040 --> 20:06.480
disorder that makes them feel virtuous or entitled, however much Lomborg, Crowder,

20:06.480 --> 20:12.160
or Kirchhoff may dislike that, it's still no excuse for misrepresenting scientific facts.

20:13.120 --> 20:18.320
While researching articles about electric cars, I was struck by how many of the negative ones

20:18.320 --> 20:23.600
were either written by Lomborg or were simply copies of his claims by people who hadn't

20:23.600 --> 20:29.440
bothered to check his facts. Time to stop worshipping the electric car by Bjorn Lomborg.

20:30.080 --> 20:36.400
Green cars have a dirty little secret by Bjorn Lomborg. Electric car benefits, just myths,

20:36.480 --> 20:42.480
by Bjorn Lomborg. Don't be fooled, Elon Musk's electric cars aren't about to save the planet,

20:42.480 --> 20:48.960
it's by Bjorn Lomborg. So Lomborg's war on electric cars has been going on for five years now,

20:48.960 --> 20:53.680
which would be fine if he could support his premise that they're not environmentally friendly.

20:53.680 --> 20:57.360
But if the only way he can do that is to make incorrect statements,

20:57.360 --> 21:01.120
omit information, and cherry-pick, then why?
