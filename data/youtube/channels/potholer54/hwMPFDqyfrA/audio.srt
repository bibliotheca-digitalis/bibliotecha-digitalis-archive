00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,600
Now here's an interesting thing I read in the blog, Louder with Crowder.

2
00:00:03,600 --> 00:00:06,480
You know how pompous people with their Nissan leaves and...

3
00:00:06,480 --> 00:00:11,120
It tells me I apparently know that electric cars are driven by pompous people

4
00:00:11,120 --> 00:00:15,200
with a sense of entitlement, who believe they're saving the planet

5
00:00:15,200 --> 00:00:18,320
and think they're better than me because they care more.

6
00:00:18,320 --> 00:00:19,040
Do I know that?

7
00:00:19,040 --> 00:00:20,400
Uh-huh. Show them this.

8
00:00:20,400 --> 00:00:24,000
This turns out to be a video which Louder with Crowder assures us...

9
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:26,560
...using things like science, facts and math...

10
00:00:26,560 --> 00:00:28,240
...and it comes from a university.

11
00:00:28,960 --> 00:00:31,040
Well, that sounds like a reliable source...

12
00:00:31,040 --> 00:00:35,360
The great people at Prager University have shown, with illustrations,

13
00:00:35,360 --> 00:00:38,640
the people who drive electric cars and think they're saving the planet

14
00:00:38,640 --> 00:00:41,360
are in fact borderline functionally retarded.

15
00:00:41,360 --> 00:00:46,080
Okay, just a reminder, Prager University is not a university,

16
00:00:46,080 --> 00:00:48,720
it's a YouTube channel just like mine.

17
00:00:48,720 --> 00:00:52,800
So like my channel, you have to check where its information comes from,

18
00:00:52,800 --> 00:00:54,880
however good its illustrations.

19
00:00:55,200 --> 00:00:58,000
I was going to include this in part two of my series,

20
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,240
A Conservative Solution to Climate Change.

21
00:01:00,720 --> 00:01:05,040
But pulling the PragerU video apart was such a fascinating journey

22
00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:07,200
that I'm posting it separately.

23
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:09,120
You'll have to wait a bit longer for part two.

24
00:01:09,760 --> 00:01:13,200
Like most Prager University courses, as they're called,

25
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:18,160
this is basically just a five-minute video presented here by Bjorn Lomborg.

26
00:01:18,160 --> 00:01:20,800
Do electric cars really help the environment?

27
00:01:20,800 --> 00:01:22,640
President Obama thinks so.

28
00:01:22,880 --> 00:01:25,760
So does Leonardo DiCaprio, and many others.

29
00:01:25,760 --> 00:01:29,280
But since the physics of car emissions is a scientific issue,

30
00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:31,760
not a political or a thespian one,

31
00:01:31,760 --> 00:01:35,600
isn't the more important point that scientists think so.

32
00:01:35,600 --> 00:01:40,720
The energy efficiency of cars is not based on the beliefs of left-wing actors and politicians,

33
00:01:40,720 --> 00:01:42,960
but meticulous scientific studies.

34
00:01:43,520 --> 00:01:48,720
So instead of watching the unequal fight of Lomborg taking on Obama and DiCaprio,

35
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:53,200
let's put him in the ring with some actual scientific research

36
00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:55,600
and see how his claims stand up to scrutiny.

37
00:01:56,960 --> 00:01:59,920
First, there's the energy needed to produce the car.

38
00:02:00,560 --> 00:02:04,720
More than a third of the lifetime carbon dioxide emissions from an electric car

39
00:02:04,720 --> 00:02:08,080
comes from the energy used to make the car itself.

40
00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:08,800
This is true.

41
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:13,920
Making an electric car uses more energy than making a gasoline-powered car,

42
00:02:13,920 --> 00:02:17,840
mainly because the making of a battery is very energy-intensive.

43
00:02:18,640 --> 00:02:22,880
So researchers look at the lifetime carbon footprint of an electric car,

44
00:02:22,880 --> 00:02:25,840
including production, driving usage, and scrapping.

45
00:02:26,480 --> 00:02:29,600
Around one third of the carbon footprint, sometimes more,

46
00:02:29,600 --> 00:02:33,920
can be taken up in just making the vehicle, as Lomborg rightly points out.

47
00:02:34,960 --> 00:02:40,400
What Lomborg doesn't tell us is how that compares to the production of a gasoline-powered car.

48
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:41,520
So let's take a look.

49
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:47,760
Turns out that only one tenth of the gasoline car's carbon footprint comes from production,

50
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:49,280
which sounds good.

51
00:02:49,280 --> 00:02:51,200
So why doesn't Lomborg mention it?

52
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,800
Well, because the reason for the smaller ratio

53
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:59,280
is that gasoline cars use a huge amount of energy just being driven around.

54
00:03:00,240 --> 00:03:03,680
So despite the smaller amount of energy used in manufacture,

55
00:03:03,680 --> 00:03:08,240
gasoline cars have a much higher overall carbon footprint than electric cars.

56
00:03:08,960 --> 00:03:11,280
Diesel cars are much more fuel-efficient,

57
00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:16,000
but even that doesn't bring their overall carbon footprint below electric cars.

58
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:21,440
While it's true that electric cars don't run on gasoline, they do run on electricity,

59
00:03:21,440 --> 00:03:26,320
which in the US is often produced by another fossil fuel, coal.

60
00:03:26,320 --> 00:03:32,880
As green venture capitalist Vinod Khosla likes to point out, electric cars are coal-powered cars.

61
00:03:33,600 --> 00:03:39,440
That would be true if all the electricity they use comes from coal, but of course it doesn't.

62
00:03:39,440 --> 00:03:44,320
In the United States, some grids have a high coal component, others have none at all.

63
00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:49,920
And for the national average, coal fuels less than a third of America's electricity.

64
00:03:50,800 --> 00:03:53,920
The most popular electric car, the Nissan Leaf,

65
00:03:53,920 --> 00:03:58,880
over a 90,000 mile lifetime will emit 31 metric tonnes of CO2.

66
00:03:59,600 --> 00:04:05,760
A comparable Mercedes CDI A160 over a similar lifetime will emit just three

67
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:10,560
tonnes more across its production, diesel consumption and ultimate scrapping.

68
00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:13,600
That's close to a 10% difference, which is not much.

69
00:04:14,240 --> 00:04:18,160
So, as always, we have to ask, where do Lomborg's figures come from?

70
00:04:19,040 --> 00:04:20,880
PragerU doesn't tell us.

71
00:04:20,880 --> 00:04:26,560
Unlike my channel, where all my sources are cited, you rarely find citations at PragerU,

72
00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:29,360
just a lot of advertising for their social media sites.

73
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:33,600
I don't know why they don't want to tell you where their information comes from,

74
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:36,000
but it means you can't check and verify it.

75
00:04:36,640 --> 00:04:38,800
So I emailed Lomborg to ask him.

76
00:04:39,760 --> 00:04:43,840
His office told me his source is this paper by Hawkins et al,

77
00:04:43,840 --> 00:04:49,040
and right up top the abstract shows not a 10% difference, as Lomborg says,

78
00:04:49,040 --> 00:04:51,600
but a range from 10% to 24%.

79
00:04:53,040 --> 00:04:58,560
The authors later issued a corrigendum, and that figure was corrected to between 17% and 30%,

80
00:04:59,200 --> 00:05:01,280
which is even further from Lomborg's claim.

81
00:05:02,080 --> 00:05:06,080
The first thing that comes to mind is that Lomborg cherry-picked the figures,

82
00:05:06,080 --> 00:05:08,320
but I can't say that without reading the study.

83
00:05:09,520 --> 00:05:13,040
Okay, I've read the study, and yep, he cherry-picked the figures.

84
00:05:13,840 --> 00:05:18,160
First of all, Lomborg has adjusted the figures to take account of America's greater reliance

85
00:05:18,160 --> 00:05:23,360
on coal as a fuel for electricity, compared to the average European fuel mix

86
00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:25,280
on which the study was based.

87
00:05:25,280 --> 00:05:26,240
That's fair enough.

88
00:05:26,960 --> 00:05:31,120
What he didn't do was adjust the fuel efficiency of the European cars

89
00:05:31,120 --> 00:05:34,640
to take account of the lower fuel efficiency in the USA,

90
00:05:34,640 --> 00:05:37,120
which would have made the electric cars look greener.

91
00:05:37,840 --> 00:05:39,840
And here's where the cherry-picking comes in.

92
00:05:40,560 --> 00:05:44,560
Turns out that when the paper looked at the crucial area of fuel consumption,

93
00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:49,360
it didn't just make one comparison with the electric car, it made two.

94
00:05:49,360 --> 00:05:52,000
One for diesel, the other for gasoline.

95
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:57,440
But the gasoline car miraculously disappears when Lomborg does his own calculations.

96
00:05:58,080 --> 00:05:58,400
Why?

97
00:05:58,960 --> 00:06:04,800
Presumably because even in fuel-efficient Europe, diesel cars have much better fuel economy,

98
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:09,920
in this case around 53 miles to the gallon combined city and highway driving,

99
00:06:09,920 --> 00:06:13,360
and therefore emit far fewer lifetime CO2 emissions.

100
00:06:14,320 --> 00:06:18,240
I did email Lomborg's office again asking why he had ignored the comparison

101
00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:23,040
with the gasoline car, and I was stunned by this reply from his media manager.

102
00:06:23,920 --> 00:06:27,600
I'm sure many drivers of different cars would want whatever vehicle they drive

103
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:30,080
to be included in an analysis.

104
00:06:30,080 --> 00:06:33,840
However, comparison of one fossil fuel and one electric car

105
00:06:33,840 --> 00:06:37,200
is the simplest and clearest way of highlighting their differences.

106
00:06:38,160 --> 00:06:43,600
Anyone who understands basic science or data analysis must be face-palming right now.

107
00:06:44,320 --> 00:06:48,400
Yes, I'm sure drivers of different cars would want whatever vehicle they drive

108
00:06:48,400 --> 00:06:53,360
to be included in the analysis, but we're not dealing with drivers of different cars

109
00:06:53,360 --> 00:06:54,640
or what they want.

110
00:06:54,640 --> 00:06:58,880
We're dealing with a scientific study that made two comparisons.

111
00:06:58,880 --> 00:07:02,560
Lomborg picked the one that came closest to supporting his conclusion

112
00:07:02,560 --> 00:07:04,160
and ignored the one that didn't.

113
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:07,920
This is the lamest excuse for cherry-picking I've ever read.

114
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:12,800
If you don't understand how wrong that is, it would be like me claiming that

115
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:19,200
65% of US electricity comes from renewable resources, citing this study as my source.

116
00:07:19,920 --> 00:07:23,840
I'm sure Lomborg would be the first to say this is an absurd claim

117
00:07:23,840 --> 00:07:28,320
and accuse me of cherry-picking just one grid and ignoring the rest.

118
00:07:28,320 --> 00:07:30,720
Would it be a legitimate excuse to say,

119
00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:35,920
I'm sure many people would want whatever grid they're connected to included in an analysis,

120
00:07:35,920 --> 00:07:38,800
but it's simpler and clearer to use just one.

121
00:07:39,520 --> 00:07:42,560
Cherry-picking just one comparison may be simple,

122
00:07:42,560 --> 00:07:47,040
but that makes it very unclear that the other comparison in the study

123
00:07:47,040 --> 00:07:49,040
is screaming a very different result.

124
00:07:50,240 --> 00:07:53,360
If it is simpler and clearer to choose just one,

125
00:07:53,360 --> 00:07:55,840
the obvious choice would have been the gasoline car.

126
00:07:56,720 --> 00:08:01,040
After all, only around 5% of Americans drive diesel cars,

127
00:08:01,040 --> 00:08:05,200
and even though the gasoline car gets 42 miles to the gallon combined,

128
00:08:05,200 --> 00:08:08,800
which is way more than most similar-sized American cars,

129
00:08:08,800 --> 00:08:13,280
at least it's closer than the diesel's 53 miles to the gallon combined.

130
00:08:13,280 --> 00:08:18,080
Better yet, adjust the fuel economy to an average of what most Americans drive.

131
00:08:18,080 --> 00:08:22,960
I checked the EPA's annual fuel economy list for new small and hatchback cars,

132
00:08:22,960 --> 00:08:28,320
and most gasoline vehicles in the USA are around or under 30 miles to the gallon combined,

133
00:08:28,880 --> 00:08:35,120
so they're emitting around twice as much CO2 as the diesel comparison that Lomborg cherry-picked.

134
00:08:35,120 --> 00:08:40,400
Then he goes on to make another comparison for larger cars, and again picks a diesel.

135
00:08:40,400 --> 00:08:45,040
The results are similar for a top-line Tesla, the king of electric cars.

136
00:08:45,040 --> 00:08:51,920
It emits about 44 tons, which is only five tons less than a similar Audi A7 Quattro.

137
00:08:51,920 --> 00:08:53,360
That's a difference of about 10%.

138
00:08:54,480 --> 00:09:00,160
PragerU cites no source, but USA Today gives us a link in Lomborg's opinion piece

139
00:09:00,160 --> 00:09:05,040
where the same claim is made, and this was confirmed by Lomborg's office as his source.

140
00:09:05,760 --> 00:09:08,800
But the links just take you to this government website,

141
00:09:08,800 --> 00:09:11,200
listing the fuel economies of the two cars.

142
00:09:11,760 --> 00:09:15,200
So let's see what actual published studies have found.

143
00:09:16,400 --> 00:09:21,440
The Union of Concerned Scientists made a cradle-to-grave emissions study in the USA.

144
00:09:21,440 --> 00:09:28,480
It found that gasoline cars emit 29 tons more CO2 equivalents than mid-size electric cars,

145
00:09:28,480 --> 00:09:32,880
powered by an electricity grid mix representative of where those cars are sold,

146
00:09:33,520 --> 00:09:35,680
and 54 tons for large cars.

147
00:09:36,320 --> 00:09:40,400
That's 51% and 53% lower, respectively.

148
00:09:41,280 --> 00:09:46,560
It's important to point out that where the cars are sold is not the same as the grid average,

149
00:09:46,560 --> 00:09:48,960
and it brings me back to that all-important point.

150
00:09:49,600 --> 00:09:54,800
The carbon footprint of electric cars depends on the fuel mix of the grid where they're charged,

151
00:09:54,800 --> 00:09:57,360
and the fuel mix of the grid where the batteries are made.

152
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:03,200
The UCS study shows that different US grids have markedly different fuel mixes.

153
00:10:04,400 --> 00:10:08,400
Even where a grid has a high component of coal-fueled electricity,

154
00:10:08,400 --> 00:10:13,280
the car can still have a low carbon footprint by being produced and charged off-grid.

155
00:10:14,160 --> 00:10:19,840
Tesla, for example, is building huge battery manufacturing plants in Nevada and China,

156
00:10:19,840 --> 00:10:21,360
powered by solar energy.

157
00:10:22,640 --> 00:10:30,560
As for charging off-grid, the UCS study cited a 2013 survey showing that 32% of respondents

158
00:10:30,560 --> 00:10:37,200
who bought electric cars had solar panels on their roofs, and 16% intended to install them.

159
00:10:37,760 --> 00:10:40,480
Another factor is urban versus highway driving.

160
00:10:41,040 --> 00:10:46,320
The gap between gasoline and electric is much larger in cities, for various reasons.

161
00:10:46,320 --> 00:10:50,720
For one thing, gasoline cars use a lot of energy just idling in traffic.

162
00:10:51,520 --> 00:10:57,520
Another cradle-to-grave study done in France found that a small electric car emits 63%

163
00:10:57,520 --> 00:11:02,080
less carbon dioxide than a gasoline car, from production to scrapping,

164
00:11:02,080 --> 00:11:04,800
and 70% if the cars are recycled.

165
00:11:05,360 --> 00:11:11,360
For a larger electric car compared to a larger diesel car, the difference is 44% to 57%.

166
00:11:12,320 --> 00:11:16,160
That's a saving of between 21 and 20 tons of carbon dioxide.

167
00:11:16,960 --> 00:11:20,880
But again, the study's results reflect the mix of fuels used.

168
00:11:20,880 --> 00:11:24,480
In France, most electrical energy is nuclear-powered,

169
00:11:24,480 --> 00:11:30,800
so electric cars there are much greener than they would be in Estonia, which is mostly coal-powered.

170
00:11:30,880 --> 00:11:35,920
But remember Vinod Khosla's observation. Electric cars are coal-powered cars.

171
00:11:35,920 --> 00:11:41,440
But we've already established that this observation is not an observation. It's a fallacy.

172
00:11:41,440 --> 00:11:44,560
Yes, it might be powered by coal, proponents will say.

173
00:11:44,560 --> 00:11:49,040
No, proponents of electric cars would not say that if they'd read any of the studies.

174
00:11:49,040 --> 00:11:52,720
They'd say that most electric cars are partially powered by coal.

175
00:11:53,280 --> 00:11:56,640
And they'd point out that many aren't powered by coal at all.

176
00:11:56,640 --> 00:12:01,440
But unlike the regular car, coal plant emissions are far away from city centers,

177
00:12:01,440 --> 00:12:05,520
where most people live, and where damage from air pollution is greatest.

178
00:12:05,520 --> 00:12:09,040
New research in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences

179
00:12:09,040 --> 00:12:12,160
found that while gasoline cars pollute closer to home,

180
00:12:12,720 --> 00:12:16,240
coal firepower actually pollutes more. A lot more.

181
00:12:16,880 --> 00:12:24,480
How much more? Well, the researchers estimate that if the U.S. has 10% more gasoline cars in 2020,

182
00:12:24,480 --> 00:12:28,640
870 more people will die each year from the additional air pollution.

183
00:12:29,280 --> 00:12:35,360
If the U.S. has 10% more electric vehicles powered on the average U.S. electricity mix,

184
00:12:35,360 --> 00:12:40,560
1617 more people will die every year from the extra pollution.

185
00:12:40,560 --> 00:12:44,320
Matching the figures Lomborg uses with the name of the journal he gives,

186
00:12:44,320 --> 00:12:48,480
I think he's talking about this 2014 paper by Tessam et al.

187
00:12:49,280 --> 00:12:52,880
If so, he's absolutely right. That's what the paper found.

188
00:12:53,520 --> 00:12:58,960
But that's still not the whole story, because if burning more coal leads to more deaths,

189
00:12:58,960 --> 00:13:03,360
then surely burning less coal would lead to fewer deaths, wouldn't it?

190
00:13:03,360 --> 00:13:08,640
And the Tessam study found exactly that. The red circle in the middle shows the number of deaths

191
00:13:08,640 --> 00:13:14,320
from a 10% increase in electric cars if that electricity is sourced by the average U.S.

192
00:13:14,320 --> 00:13:18,160
fuel mix, compared to gasoline, circled in red at the top.

193
00:13:18,960 --> 00:13:23,520
As Lomborg correctly reports, that's 1617 more deaths.

194
00:13:24,240 --> 00:13:29,600
But the researchers also concluded that if natural gas was the source of that electricity,

195
00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:34,720
shown by the red circle near the bottom, there'd be less than 500 extra deaths.

196
00:13:34,720 --> 00:13:38,880
That's far fewer than the 870 deaths from gasoline-driven cars.

197
00:13:39,760 --> 00:13:44,400
Better yet, the authors found that if electric cars sourced their energy from renewables,

198
00:13:44,400 --> 00:13:48,480
wind, water, and solar, the number of deaths would be cut even further,

199
00:13:48,480 --> 00:13:52,880
to less than 200. Most of that coming from emissions during production.

200
00:13:53,760 --> 00:13:57,520
So if we're worried about deaths caused by coal-burning power stations,

201
00:13:57,520 --> 00:14:01,440
the obvious solution is to replace them with cleaner energy sources.

202
00:14:02,160 --> 00:14:05,440
That's already happening. Which brings us to the next question.

203
00:14:06,080 --> 00:14:11,520
Won't the perceived rapid ramp-up of these renewables make future electric cars much cleaner?

204
00:14:12,400 --> 00:14:15,280
Unfortunately, this is mostly wishful thinking.

205
00:14:15,280 --> 00:14:20,240
Today, the U.S. gets 14% of its electric power from renewables.

206
00:14:20,240 --> 00:14:23,920
In 25 years, Obama's Energy Information Administration

207
00:14:23,920 --> 00:14:29,680
estimates that number will have gone up just 3 percentage points to 17%.

208
00:14:29,680 --> 00:14:33,840
I don't know why Obama's name keeps popping up, because this is supposed to be a scientific

209
00:14:33,840 --> 00:14:39,280
question. But just to clarify, this isn't Obama's Energy Information Administration,

210
00:14:39,280 --> 00:14:44,160
it's a Federal Statistics and Analysis Office that's been operating under seven different

211
00:14:44,160 --> 00:14:48,080
presidents of both political parties and is still going strong today.

212
00:14:48,800 --> 00:14:53,680
And it shows that the United States is already getting 17% of its electricity

213
00:14:53,680 --> 00:14:57,760
from renewable energy. And that's just the U.S. average,

214
00:14:57,760 --> 00:15:02,080
which includes areas that have little interest in renewable energy and no targets.

215
00:15:02,960 --> 00:15:07,200
If we look at the states that do, many of them are looking at renewable targets of

216
00:15:07,200 --> 00:15:12,960
20 to 30%, well before 2040. So getting energy from renewables

217
00:15:12,960 --> 00:15:17,280
is not wishful thinking in places where it's being actively pursued.

218
00:15:17,280 --> 00:15:21,920
It's only wishful thinking in places that do nothing except wishfully think.

219
00:15:22,640 --> 00:15:26,160
But that's not the whole story on how emissions are coming down.

220
00:15:26,160 --> 00:15:29,360
Listen carefully to Lomborg's choice of words as he continues.

221
00:15:29,920 --> 00:15:35,280
Meanwhile, those fossil fuels that generate 65% of U.S. electricity today

222
00:15:35,280 --> 00:15:42,240
will still generate about 64% of it in 2040. So it sounds as though coal will still be

223
00:15:42,240 --> 00:15:45,680
generating the same amount of electricity as it does today.

224
00:15:45,680 --> 00:15:51,600
But Lomborg doesn't use the word coal here. He refers to fossil fuels, which is odd because

225
00:15:51,600 --> 00:15:56,720
there are two main fossil fuels generating electricity, coal and natural gas.

226
00:15:56,720 --> 00:16:02,800
And the EIA always differentiates between them. So why did Lomborg suddenly change the EIA's

227
00:16:02,800 --> 00:16:07,600
classification here and lump them together? It might have something to do with the fact

228
00:16:07,600 --> 00:16:10,400
that these fuels have very different emissions profiles.

229
00:16:11,040 --> 00:16:15,840
Natural gas is a lot less polluting and releases far less CO2 than coal.

230
00:16:16,400 --> 00:16:21,760
So if the mix of fossil fuels changes, that would affect the carbon footprint of electric cars

231
00:16:21,760 --> 00:16:24,480
just as much as changing the percentage of renewables.

232
00:16:25,280 --> 00:16:30,480
So let's look at the figures. The 2015 EIA report, the latest one

233
00:16:30,480 --> 00:16:37,200
available to Lomborg when he made this video, shows that in 2013 coal comprised 39% of the

234
00:16:37,200 --> 00:16:42,240
total. That's the dark grey. Natural gas in red was at 27%.

235
00:16:43,360 --> 00:16:48,640
The same report predicted that by 2040 the proportion of coal would fall to 34%

236
00:16:49,440 --> 00:16:54,880
and natural gas would rise to 31%. So by lumping them together,

237
00:16:54,880 --> 00:17:00,000
Lomborg can make it look as though nothing is changing. The overall percentage stays the same.

238
00:17:00,720 --> 00:17:04,320
But that disguises the fact that because of the changing mix,

239
00:17:04,320 --> 00:17:08,160
these fossil fuels will produce less CO2 and be a lot cleaner.

240
00:17:08,880 --> 00:17:11,920
It's on top of that that we have the rise in renewable energy.

241
00:17:13,120 --> 00:17:17,760
Even those projections are now obsolete. According to the latest EIA report,

242
00:17:17,760 --> 00:17:23,120
coal has already fallen way below 34%, 22 years ahead of prediction.

243
00:17:23,680 --> 00:17:29,600
Natural gas has already surpassed 31%. So the fossil fuel mix has already shifted

244
00:17:29,600 --> 00:17:34,320
in favour of lower CO2 emissions. Lomborg's next complaint is about

245
00:17:34,320 --> 00:17:37,840
the making of the electric car itself, especially the battery.

246
00:17:38,720 --> 00:17:42,640
The mining of lithium, for instance, is not a green activity.

247
00:17:42,640 --> 00:17:46,240
That's true. Lithium mining does a lot of environmental damage.

248
00:17:46,800 --> 00:17:52,720
Just look at this lithium mine in South America. As well as the horrendous scar on the landscape

249
00:17:52,720 --> 00:17:57,200
that you can see, what you can't see is the water taken to extract the lithium,

250
00:17:57,200 --> 00:18:02,560
which leads to depletion from local farms. In Tibet, chemicals used in lithium extraction

251
00:18:02,560 --> 00:18:07,840
have leaked into rivers, killing fish. Tailings from lithium mines worldwide

252
00:18:07,840 --> 00:18:10,720
blot the landscape and contaminate the water table.

253
00:18:11,520 --> 00:18:15,760
Clearly Lomborg's right. Lithium mining is not a green activity.

254
00:18:17,280 --> 00:18:22,560
But of course neither is oil sand mining to make gasoline, or oil shale mining,

255
00:18:22,560 --> 00:18:28,160
or oil extraction by other means, like in-situ oil shale extraction and oil drilling,

256
00:18:28,160 --> 00:18:32,880
or like the transport of oil. Oil leakage and spills also contaminate

257
00:18:32,880 --> 00:18:37,920
water supplies and kill fish. Oil pipelines are a blot on the landscape

258
00:18:37,920 --> 00:18:42,800
and block animal migration routes. Is the environmental damage done by oil

259
00:18:42,800 --> 00:18:45,920
worse than lithium? That would be useful to know.

260
00:18:45,920 --> 00:18:48,960
But for some reason, Lomborg only mentions lithium.

261
00:18:49,600 --> 00:18:53,200
While electric car owners may cruise around feeling virtuous.

262
00:18:53,200 --> 00:18:59,920
OK, again, personal feelings towards electric car owners are irrelevant because that's not science.

263
00:18:59,920 --> 00:19:05,200
Whether you feel people who drive electric cars are feeling virtuous, or pompous, or driving with

264
00:19:05,200 --> 00:19:10,640
a sense of entitlement, that shouldn't be a factor in deciding whether electric cars are greener than

265
00:19:10,640 --> 00:19:16,000
gasoline cars. It's possible these people drive electric cars because they're great value for

266
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:22,160
money. Even without tax breaks, electric car prices have come down so fast and are so cheap

267
00:19:22,160 --> 00:19:27,840
to run that owners have simply done the math. According to an article in Forbes magazine,

268
00:19:27,840 --> 00:19:32,080
once you figure in the cost of ownership, especially maintenance and fuel,

269
00:19:32,080 --> 00:19:35,520
electric vehicles are a bargain despite the upfront price tag.

270
00:19:36,080 --> 00:19:40,400
If you buy an electric vehicle rather than a gasoline-powered one, you're probably going

271
00:19:40,400 --> 00:19:45,120
to save a lot of money during the time you own it. You don't need to be a member of the Sierra

272
00:19:45,120 --> 00:19:50,560
Club to see the appeal of going electric. So maybe these buyers aren't borderline

273
00:19:50,560 --> 00:19:55,040
functionally retarded, maybe they've just gone through the figures and are smart enough to

274
00:19:55,040 --> 00:20:01,040
understand basic economics. But even if electric car owners did have some sort of personality

275
00:20:01,040 --> 00:20:06,480
disorder that makes them feel virtuous or entitled, however much Lomborg, Crowder,

276
00:20:06,480 --> 00:20:12,160
or Kirchhoff may dislike that, it's still no excuse for misrepresenting scientific facts.

277
00:20:13,120 --> 00:20:18,320
While researching articles about electric cars, I was struck by how many of the negative ones

278
00:20:18,320 --> 00:20:23,600
were either written by Lomborg or were simply copies of his claims by people who hadn't

279
00:20:23,600 --> 00:20:29,440
bothered to check his facts. Time to stop worshipping the electric car by Bjorn Lomborg.

280
00:20:30,080 --> 00:20:36,400
Green cars have a dirty little secret by Bjorn Lomborg. Electric car benefits, just myths,

281
00:20:36,480 --> 00:20:42,480
by Bjorn Lomborg. Don't be fooled, Elon Musk's electric cars aren't about to save the planet,

282
00:20:42,480 --> 00:20:48,960
it's by Bjorn Lomborg. So Lomborg's war on electric cars has been going on for five years now,

283
00:20:48,960 --> 00:20:53,680
which would be fine if he could support his premise that they're not environmentally friendly.

284
00:20:53,680 --> 00:20:57,360
But if the only way he can do that is to make incorrect statements,

285
00:20:57,360 --> 00:21:01,120
omit information, and cherry-pick, then why?
