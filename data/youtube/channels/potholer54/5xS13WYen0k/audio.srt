00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,640
My correction of Suspicious Observer's video a couple of days ago really seems to have hit

2
00:00:04,640 --> 00:00:11,600
a raw nerve. Ben Davidson, aka Suspicious Observers, came onto this channel calling me a liar,

3
00:00:11,600 --> 00:00:17,520
saying he'd been misquoted, challenging me to a debate, and posting a video response attacking me

4
00:00:17,520 --> 00:00:21,360
and the people who agreed with me, all in the space of a few hours.

5
00:00:21,360 --> 00:00:29,120
But apparently Potholer54 misunderstood and he has thousands of very angry and foul-mouthed

6
00:00:29,120 --> 00:00:34,640
commenters who are really mucking this up. I made a request to debate him but, as always,

7
00:00:34,640 --> 00:00:38,640
he probably will not answer. Actually, I answered immediately, Ben.

8
00:00:38,640 --> 00:00:43,760
I replied to your post within an hour of you posting your request. I even told you the time

9
00:00:43,760 --> 00:00:49,520
that you can reach me at home and said any date after Tuesday would be fine. I also pinned my

10
00:00:49,520 --> 00:00:55,040
response to your post so it wouldn't get buried. It's been three days now and I still haven't heard

11
00:00:55,040 --> 00:00:59,680
back. There seems to be a fair bit of confusion about what actually was said.

12
00:00:59,680 --> 00:01:04,480
No, there was no confusion at all about what was said, in other words what you said,

13
00:01:04,480 --> 00:01:10,160
because I posted your video exactly as you made it. It appears that it's very possible that

14
00:01:10,960 --> 00:01:17,680
there was either some selective editing or intentional lying about what was attempting

15
00:01:17,680 --> 00:01:23,440
to be said. It appears it's very possible. Well, either there was selective editing or

16
00:01:23,440 --> 00:01:29,280
there wasn't, and if there was, then by all means point it out. For the first half of my video,

17
00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:35,760
I played your video exactly as you posted it, in chronological order and without a single change.

18
00:01:36,400 --> 00:01:40,000
I didn't edit a second of it. I simply paused it to comment.

19
00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:45,680
For the second half of my video, I only edited in order to skip to the parts you got wrong.

20
00:01:45,680 --> 00:01:49,280
If you think these omissions change the context, tell us where.

21
00:01:50,160 --> 00:01:55,280
Anyway, let's move on to Ben's actual rebuttal. We'll start by reminding ourselves of what he

22
00:01:55,280 --> 00:01:58,720
said in his original video. The ice melts, the planet heats up,

23
00:01:58,720 --> 00:02:02,880
the methane is released, and somehow every time we plunge into an ice age.

24
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:06,640
Ben's statement here suggests he's describing the start of a glaciation,

25
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:12,880
even though he mistakenly calls it an ice age. But he's also mixed in features of the end of

26
00:02:12,880 --> 00:02:18,240
a glaciation, like melting ice and methane release. So if he's talking about the end

27
00:02:18,240 --> 00:02:20,720
of a glaciation, then he made these mistakes.

28
00:02:23,040 --> 00:02:27,440
And if he's talking about the end of an interglacial, then he made these mistakes.

29
00:02:32,080 --> 00:02:37,440
Take your pick. In his response video, Ben gave a clue as to which one he's talking about.

30
00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:40,560
We basically have this glacial cycle and I was talking about how,

31
00:02:41,600 --> 00:02:46,800
you know, we have this ice melting and then we come out of the glacial cycle.

32
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:50,960
There. He's pointing to a part of the curve coming out of a glaciation.

33
00:02:51,520 --> 00:02:54,720
So we now know which set of errors he made. This one.

34
00:02:55,440 --> 00:03:00,080
He suggests that when the Earth comes out of a glaciation, it goes into an ice age,

35
00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:04,320
by which he means a glaciation, because he uses both words interchangeably.

36
00:03:04,880 --> 00:03:09,520
Which of course it doesn't. It goes into an interglacial, as I explained in my correction.

37
00:03:10,240 --> 00:03:14,720
We should know, because when the last glaciation ended about 12,000 years ago,

38
00:03:14,720 --> 00:03:18,080
we entered just such an interglacial and we're still in it now.

39
00:03:18,720 --> 00:03:22,560
Researchers say it should last at least another 16,000 years.

40
00:03:23,440 --> 00:03:29,200
Also in the original video he thought that at the end of a glaciation, ice accumulates at the poles.

41
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:33,200
I assumed Ben would correct this after I explained that it doesn't,

42
00:03:33,200 --> 00:03:36,880
but in his response he simply repeated the error.

43
00:03:36,880 --> 00:03:41,200
The ice accumulates up at the poles and it's basically concentrated up there.

44
00:03:41,200 --> 00:03:45,600
As I already explained in my correction, ice thins and shrinks at the poles at the end of

45
00:03:45,600 --> 00:03:51,760
a glaciation. Ben goes on to hint that either the ice migrated northwards from lower latitudes

46
00:03:51,760 --> 00:03:57,120
and accumulated that way, in which case he'll need to show how the ice managed to do this,

47
00:03:57,120 --> 00:04:02,240
or he hints that he accepts the conventional view that at the end of a glaciation most of

48
00:04:02,240 --> 00:04:07,200
the ice sheets melted and all that was left was greatly reduced ice at the poles.

49
00:04:07,920 --> 00:04:11,840
That's not accumulation, in which case why not simply correct it?

50
00:04:12,800 --> 00:04:18,160
Ben did come close to grudgingly admitting that maybe this accumulation claim was a mistake,

51
00:04:18,160 --> 00:04:21,440
but he quickly decides, nah, can't be me.

52
00:04:21,440 --> 00:04:28,320
So one could see that one as being a mistake, maybe there's a language barrier, maybe he didn't

53
00:04:28,320 --> 00:04:34,240
put it together since I was just talking about this and literally went to this in a matter of

54
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:38,800
the first minute of the video. I feel like that's... it's hard to believe somebody could

55
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:43,120
lose a train of thought in the first 60 seconds of a video, but it's possible.

56
00:04:43,120 --> 00:04:49,600
Yeah, it turns out it's my fault for losing my... what did he say again? Anyway, whatever it was.

57
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:54,400
If there is a language barrier it's because I'm using scientific terminology where words like

58
00:04:54,400 --> 00:05:01,200
glaciation, interglacial, glacial cycle and ice age have specific meanings. I get it Ben,

59
00:05:01,280 --> 00:05:06,160
this isn't your field, but when you use these terms interchangeably it simply adds to your

60
00:05:06,160 --> 00:05:12,320
already confused picture of what causes glacial cycles. And the word accumulate has a specific

61
00:05:12,320 --> 00:05:18,720
meaning not just in science but in plain English. It means to acquire an increasing quantity,

62
00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:24,160
as in the poles do not acquire an increasing quantity of ice at the end of a glaciation.

63
00:05:24,960 --> 00:05:29,520
I never thought I'd say these words but take a tip from John Travolta.

64
00:05:29,520 --> 00:05:32,800
Well that's the difference between you and me Harry. I say what I mean.

65
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:36,560
The other place where the deglaciation timeline comes unstuck is here.

66
00:05:37,120 --> 00:05:42,640
I've got no idea what Ben means by cold spreads to low latitudes. Perhaps he's thinking of the

67
00:05:42,640 --> 00:05:48,000
arctic vortex now hitting Europe and New England in winter. But since we now know he's talking

68
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:53,040
about the end of a glaciation, the fact is that the lower latitudes don't get colder,

69
00:05:53,040 --> 00:05:59,040
they get warmer. The biogeographical and paleontological evidence couldn't be clearer.

70
00:06:00,080 --> 00:06:05,040
So let me just put what I think Ben is trying to say in plain English, correcting his errors

71
00:06:05,040 --> 00:06:10,800
and following a glaciological timeline that's well understood by researchers. If you agree with this

72
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:16,160
Ben, then this is what you should have written in the first place. If you don't agree, then great,

73
00:06:16,160 --> 00:06:22,240
that can be the basis of our upcoming discussion. The debunking video of this video seemed to

74
00:06:22,240 --> 00:06:27,600
suggest that I was saying the mainstream articles suggested an ice age was coming.

75
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:32,480
Actually I played the clip where you suggested this. You'd just been describing the process

76
00:06:32,480 --> 00:06:37,840
by which the earth could be plunged into what you call an ice age, by which you mean a glaciation,

77
00:06:37,840 --> 00:06:43,440
and then you say this. Just this month we learned that part of that process may include that extra

78
00:06:43,440 --> 00:06:49,360
cold fresh water creating a stratification in the oceans. And as I pointed out, that's not part of

79
00:06:49,360 --> 00:06:56,320
the process towards a glaciation, and the paper you cite makes no mention of that. Attempting to

80
00:06:56,320 --> 00:07:02,320
make everyone think that I deliberately misled folks about these articles when I specifically

81
00:07:02,320 --> 00:07:08,480
said that none of them individually believes an ice age is coming or anything other than global

82
00:07:08,480 --> 00:07:13,200
warming. And in fact I played the clip where you say that. Here it is again. There's a bit of a

83
00:07:13,200 --> 00:07:18,240
circular problem here where everyone is finding signals of cold but exclaiming that all the other

84
00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:23,680
factors will overcome it to still warm the planet. Nobody is listening to the other group saying the

85
00:07:23,680 --> 00:07:53,120
exact same thing. They are a net cooling factor, not a net heating factor in the

86
00:07:53,120 --> 00:07:59,280
greenhouse sense. As I pointed out, the paper said nothing of the kind. You also claim clouds

87
00:07:59,280 --> 00:08:07,040
have 100% albedo, which is simply not true. By the way, on Sunday someone pointed out an error

88
00:08:07,040 --> 00:08:12,080
in my own video and I didn't make excuses and blame it on the inability of the poster to

89
00:08:12,080 --> 00:08:18,240
understand or call him a liar or foul-mouthed. I checked what he told me and pinned a correction.

90
00:08:18,240 --> 00:08:24,080
It really is as simple and unthreatening as that. So if you understand what leads us into

91
00:08:24,080 --> 00:08:29,120
and out of glaciations, and this is all just a problem of my inability to comprehend English

92
00:08:29,120 --> 00:08:35,440
or focus for more than 60 seconds, I'm happy to hear your explanations if and when we Skype.

93
00:08:35,440 --> 00:08:38,320
But at the moment I'm still waiting for your response.
