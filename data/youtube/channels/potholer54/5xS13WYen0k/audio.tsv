0	4640	My correction of Suspicious Observer's video a couple of days ago really seems to have hit
4640	11600	a raw nerve. Ben Davidson, aka Suspicious Observers, came onto this channel calling me a liar,
11600	17520	saying he'd been misquoted, challenging me to a debate, and posting a video response attacking me
17520	21360	and the people who agreed with me, all in the space of a few hours.
21360	29120	But apparently Potholer54 misunderstood and he has thousands of very angry and foul-mouthed
29120	34640	commenters who are really mucking this up. I made a request to debate him but, as always,
34640	38640	he probably will not answer. Actually, I answered immediately, Ben.
38640	43760	I replied to your post within an hour of you posting your request. I even told you the time
43760	49520	that you can reach me at home and said any date after Tuesday would be fine. I also pinned my
49520	55040	response to your post so it wouldn't get buried. It's been three days now and I still haven't heard
55040	59680	back. There seems to be a fair bit of confusion about what actually was said.
59680	64480	No, there was no confusion at all about what was said, in other words what you said,
64480	70160	because I posted your video exactly as you made it. It appears that it's very possible that
70960	77680	there was either some selective editing or intentional lying about what was attempting
77680	83440	to be said. It appears it's very possible. Well, either there was selective editing or
83440	89280	there wasn't, and if there was, then by all means point it out. For the first half of my video,
89280	95760	I played your video exactly as you posted it, in chronological order and without a single change.
96400	100000	I didn't edit a second of it. I simply paused it to comment.
100560	105680	For the second half of my video, I only edited in order to skip to the parts you got wrong.
105680	109280	If you think these omissions change the context, tell us where.
110160	115280	Anyway, let's move on to Ben's actual rebuttal. We'll start by reminding ourselves of what he
115280	118720	said in his original video. The ice melts, the planet heats up,
118720	122880	the methane is released, and somehow every time we plunge into an ice age.
122880	126640	Ben's statement here suggests he's describing the start of a glaciation,
127200	132880	even though he mistakenly calls it an ice age. But he's also mixed in features of the end of
132880	138240	a glaciation, like melting ice and methane release. So if he's talking about the end
138240	140720	of a glaciation, then he made these mistakes.
143040	147440	And if he's talking about the end of an interglacial, then he made these mistakes.
152080	157440	Take your pick. In his response video, Ben gave a clue as to which one he's talking about.
157440	160560	We basically have this glacial cycle and I was talking about how,
161600	166800	you know, we have this ice melting and then we come out of the glacial cycle.
166800	170960	There. He's pointing to a part of the curve coming out of a glaciation.
171520	174720	So we now know which set of errors he made. This one.
175440	180080	He suggests that when the Earth comes out of a glaciation, it goes into an ice age,
180080	184320	by which he means a glaciation, because he uses both words interchangeably.
184880	189520	Which of course it doesn't. It goes into an interglacial, as I explained in my correction.
190240	194720	We should know, because when the last glaciation ended about 12,000 years ago,
194720	198080	we entered just such an interglacial and we're still in it now.
198720	202560	Researchers say it should last at least another 16,000 years.
203440	209200	Also in the original video he thought that at the end of a glaciation, ice accumulates at the poles.
210000	213200	I assumed Ben would correct this after I explained that it doesn't,
213200	216880	but in his response he simply repeated the error.
216880	221200	The ice accumulates up at the poles and it's basically concentrated up there.
221200	225600	As I already explained in my correction, ice thins and shrinks at the poles at the end of
225600	231760	a glaciation. Ben goes on to hint that either the ice migrated northwards from lower latitudes
231760	237120	and accumulated that way, in which case he'll need to show how the ice managed to do this,
237120	242240	or he hints that he accepts the conventional view that at the end of a glaciation most of
242240	247200	the ice sheets melted and all that was left was greatly reduced ice at the poles.
247920	251840	That's not accumulation, in which case why not simply correct it?
252800	258160	Ben did come close to grudgingly admitting that maybe this accumulation claim was a mistake,
258160	261440	but he quickly decides, nah, can't be me.
261440	268320	So one could see that one as being a mistake, maybe there's a language barrier, maybe he didn't
268320	274240	put it together since I was just talking about this and literally went to this in a matter of
274240	278800	the first minute of the video. I feel like that's... it's hard to believe somebody could
278800	283120	lose a train of thought in the first 60 seconds of a video, but it's possible.
283120	289600	Yeah, it turns out it's my fault for losing my... what did he say again? Anyway, whatever it was.
289600	294400	If there is a language barrier it's because I'm using scientific terminology where words like
294400	301200	glaciation, interglacial, glacial cycle and ice age have specific meanings. I get it Ben,
301280	306160	this isn't your field, but when you use these terms interchangeably it simply adds to your
306160	312320	already confused picture of what causes glacial cycles. And the word accumulate has a specific
312320	318720	meaning not just in science but in plain English. It means to acquire an increasing quantity,
318720	324160	as in the poles do not acquire an increasing quantity of ice at the end of a glaciation.
324960	329520	I never thought I'd say these words but take a tip from John Travolta.
329520	332800	Well that's the difference between you and me Harry. I say what I mean.
332800	336560	The other place where the deglaciation timeline comes unstuck is here.
337120	342640	I've got no idea what Ben means by cold spreads to low latitudes. Perhaps he's thinking of the
342640	348000	arctic vortex now hitting Europe and New England in winter. But since we now know he's talking
348000	353040	about the end of a glaciation, the fact is that the lower latitudes don't get colder,
353040	359040	they get warmer. The biogeographical and paleontological evidence couldn't be clearer.
360080	365040	So let me just put what I think Ben is trying to say in plain English, correcting his errors
365040	370800	and following a glaciological timeline that's well understood by researchers. If you agree with this
370800	376160	Ben, then this is what you should have written in the first place. If you don't agree, then great,
376160	382240	that can be the basis of our upcoming discussion. The debunking video of this video seemed to
382240	387600	suggest that I was saying the mainstream articles suggested an ice age was coming.
387600	392480	Actually I played the clip where you suggested this. You'd just been describing the process
392480	397840	by which the earth could be plunged into what you call an ice age, by which you mean a glaciation,
397840	403440	and then you say this. Just this month we learned that part of that process may include that extra
403440	409360	cold fresh water creating a stratification in the oceans. And as I pointed out, that's not part of
409360	416320	the process towards a glaciation, and the paper you cite makes no mention of that. Attempting to
416320	422320	make everyone think that I deliberately misled folks about these articles when I specifically
422320	428480	said that none of them individually believes an ice age is coming or anything other than global
428480	433200	warming. And in fact I played the clip where you say that. Here it is again. There's a bit of a
433200	438240	circular problem here where everyone is finding signals of cold but exclaiming that all the other
438240	443680	factors will overcome it to still warm the planet. Nobody is listening to the other group saying the
443680	473120	exact same thing. They are a net cooling factor, not a net heating factor in the
473120	479280	greenhouse sense. As I pointed out, the paper said nothing of the kind. You also claim clouds
479280	487040	have 100% albedo, which is simply not true. By the way, on Sunday someone pointed out an error
487040	492080	in my own video and I didn't make excuses and blame it on the inability of the poster to
492080	498240	understand or call him a liar or foul-mouthed. I checked what he told me and pinned a correction.
498240	504080	It really is as simple and unthreatening as that. So if you understand what leads us into
504080	509120	and out of glaciations, and this is all just a problem of my inability to comprehend English
509120	515440	or focus for more than 60 seconds, I'm happy to hear your explanations if and when we Skype.
515440	518320	But at the moment I'm still waiting for your response.
