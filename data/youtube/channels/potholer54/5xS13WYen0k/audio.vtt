00:00.000 --> 00:04.640
My correction of Suspicious Observer's video a couple of days ago really seems to have hit

00:04.640 --> 00:11.600
a raw nerve. Ben Davidson, aka Suspicious Observers, came onto this channel calling me a liar,

00:11.600 --> 00:17.520
saying he'd been misquoted, challenging me to a debate, and posting a video response attacking me

00:17.520 --> 00:21.360
and the people who agreed with me, all in the space of a few hours.

00:21.360 --> 00:29.120
But apparently Potholer54 misunderstood and he has thousands of very angry and foul-mouthed

00:29.120 --> 00:34.640
commenters who are really mucking this up. I made a request to debate him but, as always,

00:34.640 --> 00:38.640
he probably will not answer. Actually, I answered immediately, Ben.

00:38.640 --> 00:43.760
I replied to your post within an hour of you posting your request. I even told you the time

00:43.760 --> 00:49.520
that you can reach me at home and said any date after Tuesday would be fine. I also pinned my

00:49.520 --> 00:55.040
response to your post so it wouldn't get buried. It's been three days now and I still haven't heard

00:55.040 --> 00:59.680
back. There seems to be a fair bit of confusion about what actually was said.

00:59.680 --> 01:04.480
No, there was no confusion at all about what was said, in other words what you said,

01:04.480 --> 01:10.160
because I posted your video exactly as you made it. It appears that it's very possible that

01:10.960 --> 01:17.680
there was either some selective editing or intentional lying about what was attempting

01:17.680 --> 01:23.440
to be said. It appears it's very possible. Well, either there was selective editing or

01:23.440 --> 01:29.280
there wasn't, and if there was, then by all means point it out. For the first half of my video,

01:29.280 --> 01:35.760
I played your video exactly as you posted it, in chronological order and without a single change.

01:36.400 --> 01:40.000
I didn't edit a second of it. I simply paused it to comment.

01:40.560 --> 01:45.680
For the second half of my video, I only edited in order to skip to the parts you got wrong.

01:45.680 --> 01:49.280
If you think these omissions change the context, tell us where.

01:50.160 --> 01:55.280
Anyway, let's move on to Ben's actual rebuttal. We'll start by reminding ourselves of what he

01:55.280 --> 01:58.720
said in his original video. The ice melts, the planet heats up,

01:58.720 --> 02:02.880
the methane is released, and somehow every time we plunge into an ice age.

02:02.880 --> 02:06.640
Ben's statement here suggests he's describing the start of a glaciation,

02:07.200 --> 02:12.880
even though he mistakenly calls it an ice age. But he's also mixed in features of the end of

02:12.880 --> 02:18.240
a glaciation, like melting ice and methane release. So if he's talking about the end

02:18.240 --> 02:20.720
of a glaciation, then he made these mistakes.

02:23.040 --> 02:27.440
And if he's talking about the end of an interglacial, then he made these mistakes.

02:32.080 --> 02:37.440
Take your pick. In his response video, Ben gave a clue as to which one he's talking about.

02:37.440 --> 02:40.560
We basically have this glacial cycle and I was talking about how,

02:41.600 --> 02:46.800
you know, we have this ice melting and then we come out of the glacial cycle.

02:46.800 --> 02:50.960
There. He's pointing to a part of the curve coming out of a glaciation.

02:51.520 --> 02:54.720
So we now know which set of errors he made. This one.

02:55.440 --> 03:00.080
He suggests that when the Earth comes out of a glaciation, it goes into an ice age,

03:00.080 --> 03:04.320
by which he means a glaciation, because he uses both words interchangeably.

03:04.880 --> 03:09.520
Which of course it doesn't. It goes into an interglacial, as I explained in my correction.

03:10.240 --> 03:14.720
We should know, because when the last glaciation ended about 12,000 years ago,

03:14.720 --> 03:18.080
we entered just such an interglacial and we're still in it now.

03:18.720 --> 03:22.560
Researchers say it should last at least another 16,000 years.

03:23.440 --> 03:29.200
Also in the original video he thought that at the end of a glaciation, ice accumulates at the poles.

03:30.000 --> 03:33.200
I assumed Ben would correct this after I explained that it doesn't,

03:33.200 --> 03:36.880
but in his response he simply repeated the error.

03:36.880 --> 03:41.200
The ice accumulates up at the poles and it's basically concentrated up there.

03:41.200 --> 03:45.600
As I already explained in my correction, ice thins and shrinks at the poles at the end of

03:45.600 --> 03:51.760
a glaciation. Ben goes on to hint that either the ice migrated northwards from lower latitudes

03:51.760 --> 03:57.120
and accumulated that way, in which case he'll need to show how the ice managed to do this,

03:57.120 --> 04:02.240
or he hints that he accepts the conventional view that at the end of a glaciation most of

04:02.240 --> 04:07.200
the ice sheets melted and all that was left was greatly reduced ice at the poles.

04:07.920 --> 04:11.840
That's not accumulation, in which case why not simply correct it?

04:12.800 --> 04:18.160
Ben did come close to grudgingly admitting that maybe this accumulation claim was a mistake,

04:18.160 --> 04:21.440
but he quickly decides, nah, can't be me.

04:21.440 --> 04:28.320
So one could see that one as being a mistake, maybe there's a language barrier, maybe he didn't

04:28.320 --> 04:34.240
put it together since I was just talking about this and literally went to this in a matter of

04:34.240 --> 04:38.800
the first minute of the video. I feel like that's... it's hard to believe somebody could

04:38.800 --> 04:43.120
lose a train of thought in the first 60 seconds of a video, but it's possible.

04:43.120 --> 04:49.600
Yeah, it turns out it's my fault for losing my... what did he say again? Anyway, whatever it was.

04:49.600 --> 04:54.400
If there is a language barrier it's because I'm using scientific terminology where words like

04:54.400 --> 05:01.200
glaciation, interglacial, glacial cycle and ice age have specific meanings. I get it Ben,

05:01.280 --> 05:06.160
this isn't your field, but when you use these terms interchangeably it simply adds to your

05:06.160 --> 05:12.320
already confused picture of what causes glacial cycles. And the word accumulate has a specific

05:12.320 --> 05:18.720
meaning not just in science but in plain English. It means to acquire an increasing quantity,

05:18.720 --> 05:24.160
as in the poles do not acquire an increasing quantity of ice at the end of a glaciation.

05:24.960 --> 05:29.520
I never thought I'd say these words but take a tip from John Travolta.

05:29.520 --> 05:32.800
Well that's the difference between you and me Harry. I say what I mean.

05:32.800 --> 05:36.560
The other place where the deglaciation timeline comes unstuck is here.

05:37.120 --> 05:42.640
I've got no idea what Ben means by cold spreads to low latitudes. Perhaps he's thinking of the

05:42.640 --> 05:48.000
arctic vortex now hitting Europe and New England in winter. But since we now know he's talking

05:48.000 --> 05:53.040
about the end of a glaciation, the fact is that the lower latitudes don't get colder,

05:53.040 --> 05:59.040
they get warmer. The biogeographical and paleontological evidence couldn't be clearer.

06:00.080 --> 06:05.040
So let me just put what I think Ben is trying to say in plain English, correcting his errors

06:05.040 --> 06:10.800
and following a glaciological timeline that's well understood by researchers. If you agree with this

06:10.800 --> 06:16.160
Ben, then this is what you should have written in the first place. If you don't agree, then great,

06:16.160 --> 06:22.240
that can be the basis of our upcoming discussion. The debunking video of this video seemed to

06:22.240 --> 06:27.600
suggest that I was saying the mainstream articles suggested an ice age was coming.

06:27.600 --> 06:32.480
Actually I played the clip where you suggested this. You'd just been describing the process

06:32.480 --> 06:37.840
by which the earth could be plunged into what you call an ice age, by which you mean a glaciation,

06:37.840 --> 06:43.440
and then you say this. Just this month we learned that part of that process may include that extra

06:43.440 --> 06:49.360
cold fresh water creating a stratification in the oceans. And as I pointed out, that's not part of

06:49.360 --> 06:56.320
the process towards a glaciation, and the paper you cite makes no mention of that. Attempting to

06:56.320 --> 07:02.320
make everyone think that I deliberately misled folks about these articles when I specifically

07:02.320 --> 07:08.480
said that none of them individually believes an ice age is coming or anything other than global

07:08.480 --> 07:13.200
warming. And in fact I played the clip where you say that. Here it is again. There's a bit of a

07:13.200 --> 07:18.240
circular problem here where everyone is finding signals of cold but exclaiming that all the other

07:18.240 --> 07:23.680
factors will overcome it to still warm the planet. Nobody is listening to the other group saying the

07:23.680 --> 07:53.120
exact same thing. They are a net cooling factor, not a net heating factor in the

07:53.120 --> 07:59.280
greenhouse sense. As I pointed out, the paper said nothing of the kind. You also claim clouds

07:59.280 --> 08:07.040
have 100% albedo, which is simply not true. By the way, on Sunday someone pointed out an error

08:07.040 --> 08:12.080
in my own video and I didn't make excuses and blame it on the inability of the poster to

08:12.080 --> 08:18.240
understand or call him a liar or foul-mouthed. I checked what he told me and pinned a correction.

08:18.240 --> 08:24.080
It really is as simple and unthreatening as that. So if you understand what leads us into

08:24.080 --> 08:29.120
and out of glaciations, and this is all just a problem of my inability to comprehend English

08:29.120 --> 08:35.440
or focus for more than 60 seconds, I'm happy to hear your explanations if and when we Skype.

08:35.440 --> 08:38.320
But at the moment I'm still waiting for your response.
