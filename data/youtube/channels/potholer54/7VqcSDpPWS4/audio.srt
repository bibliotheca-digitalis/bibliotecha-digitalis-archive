00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,000
In July of 2006, a team of very smart people, I mean these individuals are the type to do 5,000 piece puzzles on their break, okay?

2
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:11,000
You must be very smart!

3
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:23,000
They got together, convened from various disciplines, for the sole purpose of developing a definition for the word information.

4
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:28,000
They called it UDI. It's the Universal Definition of Information.

5
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:32,000
Yeah, yeah, very clever. But who are these very smart people?

6
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:38,000
Well, Werner Gitt is a creationist and Jason Lyle is a creationist.

7
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:45,000
John Sanford, Bob Compton, creationist, creationist. Hang on, I'm beginning to spot a pattern here.

8
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:57,000
So I wonder why Snarky Apologist didn't tell us that the entire list is composed of creationists who, not surprisingly, made the definition fit the conclusion they wanted to reach.

9
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:06,000
Which is that DNA is information and language is information, so if languages were designed, DNA must have been designed. I told you they were clever.

10
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:11,000
We know that information always, always, always comes from intelligence.

11
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:18,000
Problem is, creationists are in a bit of a catch-23, which is slightly different to Joseph Heller's catch-22.

12
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:25,000
Because if DNA is information, then we can't say that information is always, always, always designed, can we?

13
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:33,000
Because we don't know that DNA was designed, so either the rule is wrong or DNA isn't information. Take your pick.

14
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:36,000
And if it was designed, then who designed it?

15
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:44,000
Certainly none of the gods and goddesses on offer, because we know from scientific evidence that the feats attributed to them never happened.

16
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:54,000
The only god it could have been is one that sprinkled DNA on the Earth over three and a half billion years ago and then let it evolve, as the evidence clearly shows.

17
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:58,000
And I don't know of any religion that has that as its credo.

18
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:03,000
But what about languages themselves? Surely they were intelligently designed?

19
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:10,000
Many cultures didn't have words like transistor. They either had to make one or use the English version which was made up.

20
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:19,000
Why, that's new information! It's just like evolution, isn't it? No, those languages were intelligently designed.

21
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:21,000
Er, huh?

22
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:27,000
If you think languages are intelligently designed, Ian, well then, tell me who designed Italian?

23
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:35,000
Modern Italian evolved over several generations from Old Italian, which evolved from Latin, which evolved from an unknown Falcian language,

24
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:41,000
which, if we trace it all the way back, came from an ancestral Proto-European language.

25
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:44,000
There are intelligently designed languages, to be sure.

26
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:53,000
This is Klingon, and yes, someone with intelligence, arguably, did sit down and design it.

27
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:57,000
But Juby's talking about the languages we speak every day.

28
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:05,000
Of course some words, like transistor, were intelligently designed because when a new invention comes along someone has to give it a name.

29
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:13,000
But most of the words we use today weren't designed. They evolved from ancestral words through mispronunciation or dialect changes,

30
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:16,000
such as the great vowel shift in medieval English.

31
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:23,000
As people moved across Europe, the Sanskrit word pada became the Latin word ped and the Danish word fod,

32
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:31,000
and ultimately the English word foot, simply through subtle changes in the way succeeding generations pronounced vowels and consonants.

33
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:37,000
Some words, like de-evolution, come about because of ignorance of existing words.

34
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:41,000
The meaning of words can also change through common use and misuse.

35
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:45,000
Look at how the meaning of the word gay has changed in just a few generations,

36
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:51,000
and people are literally misusing the meaning of the words decimate and literally.

37
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:56,000
You only have to look at Anglo-Saxon or read Chaucer to see how the way we speak has changed,

38
00:03:56,000 --> 00:04:01,000
and thanks to the medium of recording we can even hear it for ourselves.

39
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:06,000
The working class young man says that the shirt he admires is posh,

40
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:12,000
whereas the upper class young man would probably call it a peach.

41
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:18,000
Yes, this really is how we used to teach foreigners what's called the Queen's English in the 1960s.

42
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:25,000
In class-conscious England, using the wrong kind of slang can be very damaging socially.

43
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:32,000
On this record, all the idioms and the slang are in every way socially acceptable.

44
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:36,000
Hello, Johnny. You're looking a bit down. What's eating you?

45
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:39,000
Oh, I fluff my prelims.

46
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:45,000
Few people today have an accent like that, and fewer still would talk about fluffing their prelims,

47
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:48,000
unless they work in certain cinematic vocations.

48
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:52,000
This is also how the Queen used to speak back in 1957.

49
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:57,000
Because of these changes, I'm not surprised that many people feel lost

50
00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:01,000
and unable to decide what to hold on to and what to discard.

51
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:06,000
But just listen to how her grandson's accent has changed just two generations on.

52
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:10,000
No matter what, you can progress with your life.

53
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:13,000
You can do things beyond any imagination that you ever thought was possible.

54
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:17,000
Creationists would no doubt call this change microevolution.

55
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:21,000
In other words, evolution we can actually see or hear.

56
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:26,000
But of course these small changes, given enough time, add up to big changes.

57
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,000
How can they not?

58
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:32,000
But I'm sure that in support of his case, Ian's going to give us a nice example,

59
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:34,000
in the medieval sense of the word.

60
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:38,000
Just like genetic information, languages are de-evolving.

61
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:41,000
They are becoming simpler, not more complex.

62
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:46,000
For example, English used to have masculinity and femininity applied to inanimate objects,

63
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,000
just like French does.

64
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,000
Yeah, a thousand years ago, Ian.

65
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:55,000
First of all, taking one example from that far back from just one of thousands of languages

66
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:58,000
is no evidence that all languages are becoming simpler.

67
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:02,000
In fact, if we look at English since it dropped grammatical genders,

68
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:08,000
it's got more complex in its vocabulary because it's had an infusion of thousands of new words.

69
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:11,000
Anglo-Saxon had about 30,000 words.

70
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:15,000
The Oxford English Dictionary lists 600,000 in modern English,

71
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:18,000
170,000 of which are still in use.

72
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:21,000
That aside, even Juby's premise is wrong.

73
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:26,000
Becoming simpler doesn't mean the language is, as Juby calls it, de-evolving.

74
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:31,000
Losing grammatical gender can be regarded as an improvement of the language.

75
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:35,000
After all, why do we need a house to be neuter, or a table to be masculine,

76
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:40,000
or a door to be feminine, as they are in our sister language, German?

77
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:44,000
For the word the, German has an entire table of words.

78
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:48,000
I love Germans, but sorry guys, your definite article sucks.

79
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:51,000
As for the French, you say, j'ai manger, j'ai bu,

80
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:55,000
but you say, je suis izale, what's wrong with you people?

81
00:06:55,000 --> 00:07:00,000
If someone designed all this stuff, then he has to be either a sadist or a complete idiot.

82
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:04,000
When you look at a language that has been designed, like Esperanto,

83
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:09,000
the designer, Ludwig Zamenhof, did away with all these confusing rules

84
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:13,000
and irregular verbs and grammatical genders and made the language simple.

85
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:16,000
That's what denotes intelligent design.

86
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:20,000
Creationists like Juby are obsessed with what they call new information.

87
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:21,000
New information.

88
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:22,000
Gain in genetic information.

89
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:24,000
Genetic information.

90
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:27,000
To be class as evolution, they think a language and a species

91
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:30,000
must be infused with new information.

92
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:34,000
But of course, languages and species evolve by changing.

93
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:37,000
That's what evolution means.

94
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:40,000
So just because snakes lost their legs as they evolved

95
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:44,000
doesn't mean they've gone into a worse state or are going backwards.

96
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:48,000
They lost their legs because they adapted to a niche in which they didn't need legs

97
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:53,000
and in fact had a higher chance of surviving and passing on genes without them.

98
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:57,000
So the fact that languages evolve and we can see how they evolved

99
00:07:57,000 --> 00:08:02,000
and we can hear them evolving makes for a very good analogy with biological evolution.

100
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:06,000
As a language splits through geographical separation and isolation,

101
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:10,000
at first the two daughter languages are mutually intelligible

102
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:14,000
just as animals, distantly related, can interbreed with difficulty.

103
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:17,000
Then they become mutually unintelligible.

104
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:21,000
French Canadians separated from French a few hundred years ago

105
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:24,000
but the languages are still mutually intelligible.

106
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:31,000
Well, okay, only just.

107
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:35,000
Even so, French Canadian movies have to be subtitled in France.

108
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:40,000
After further isolation, languages eventually become mutually unintelligible

109
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:45,000
just as time and isolation leads to new species that can't interbreed.

110
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:48,000
The language of Dutch speakers who migrated to South Africa

111
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:53,000
and cut themselves off from the mother country eventually became Afrikaans,

112
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:57,000
which my Flemish and Dutch friends say they can't understand.

113
00:08:57,000 --> 00:09:00,000
And yet both came from the same ancestral language.

114
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:06,000
So language can be quite useful in explaining some misunderstood concepts in biological evolution.

115
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:12,000
For example, when I was explaining genetics in the video Human Ancestry Made Easy,

116
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:18,000
I said one piece of evidence as to our origins in East Africa is the rich variety of genes found there.

117
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:24,000
Populations that stay put and don't migrate will, of course, have a lot more of these genetic markers.

118
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:29,000
So it's not surprising that we find the greatest genetic diversity in Africa.

119
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:36,000
If we look at this in terms of language, the way language diverges into different accents and dialects

120
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:41,000
as population groups move apart leads to the same phenomenon.

121
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:48,000
Two recent studies found that most of the sounds or phonemes used to make language are found in Africa

122
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:52,000
and the number decreases the further away from Africa you go.

123
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:58,000
This parallels exactly the path taken by our genes in both time and space.

124
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:06,000
It confirms that all the world's languages derive from a common East African language about 150,000 years ago,

125
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:08,000
just as our genes do.

126
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:11,000
Let me give you an example closer to home.

127
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:17,000
Drive 20 miles west from the centre of Manchester and most people have a completely different accent.

128
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:19,000
They sound like John Bishop.

129
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:22,000
Is it better if they had a funny death?

130
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:23,000
The what?

131
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:24,000
A funny death.

132
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:25,000
A phony death?

133
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:26,000
No, a funny one.

134
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:28,000
A funny one.

135
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:31,000
Anybody understand what he's saying?

136
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:32,000
Yes, everyone.

137
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:35,000
He thinks I'm Hungarian.

138
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:40,000
Now is it kind of every second word or none of it?

139
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:41,000
Every second.

140
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:42,000
It's about every third or fourth.

141
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:46,000
This could be quite a long show.

142
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:53,000
We were talking backstage to the vacuum about coming to Liverpool and we have different accents

143
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:56,000
very, very close to each other all over England, isn't it?

144
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:58,000
All over Britain it's very, very different accents.

145
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:03,000
Mainly because if people speak different than you, it gives you a reason to hate them.

146
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:08,000
Could you do an English accent?

147
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:10,000
Could I do an English accent?

148
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:15,000
Drive 60 miles in the opposite direction and they sound like...

149
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:16,000
Oh, yeah, Bruno and Steve.

150
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:20,000
Yeah, I'm sure there was, you know, obviously there was one, there was the boys, really.

151
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:23,000
I mean, there was ones coming up with this, all these fancy ideas of dual-acting pistons

152
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:24,000
and heater tubes and all that.

153
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:25,000
Fair play, old boys.

154
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:28,000
But they weren't the boys machining till we found out, was they?

155
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:29,000
Was they?

156
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:30,000
Eh?

157
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:31,000
You're right.

158
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:35,000
A proverbial Martian would be able to tell very easily that American English derived

159
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:40,000
from British English and not the other way round simply because of the richness of different

160
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:44,000
accents in the UK compared to the United States.

161
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:46,000
Here they are on the same scale.

162
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:51,000
In exactly the same way, one of the ways we know that humans originated in Africa is

163
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:54,000
because of the richness of the gene pool found there.

164
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:58,000
And in answer to the creationist's often asked question,

165
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:01,000
if humans evolved from monkeys, why do we still have monkeys?

166
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:07,000
Well, it's like asking if Afrikaans evolved from Dutch, why do we still have Dutch?

167
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:08,000
Duh.

168
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:15,000
If languages didn't evolve and no humans designed them, then what's the creationist alternative?

169
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:21,000
Well, here's Conservopedia pushing the anti-science viewpoint with a familiar tactic.

170
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:23,000
Pretend there's a debate among scientists.

171
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:29,000
The only alternative offered up by Conservopedia is that language has popped out of nowhere

172
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:31,000
just as all the animals and plants did.

173
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:34,000
And what's its source for this fact?

174
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:35,000
Its only reference?

175
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:36,000
This.

176
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:38,000
A passage from the Bible.

177
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:43,000
It describes how people got together after the flood and cooperated in building a town

178
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:44,000
and a tower.

179
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:45,000
Well, that sounds nice.

180
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:48,000
And, of course, God wasn't too happy about that.

181
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:52,000
If, as one people speaking the same language, they have begun to do this,

182
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:55,000
then nothing they plan to do will be impossible for them.

183
00:12:55,000 --> 00:13:00,000
Come, let us go down and confuse their language so they will not understand each other.

184
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:01,000
Thanks, God.

185
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:06,000
So is there any evidence for this Tower of Babel anywhere except the Bible?

186
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:07,000
Of course not.

187
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:11,000
No archaeological or linguistic or genetic evidence at all.

188
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:14,000
So creationists have had to pluck one out of thin air.

189
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:16,000
This is the Chinese written language.

190
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:18,000
Of course they use pictographs.

191
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:21,000
Images that they will use to make up different words

192
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:23,000
and then they'll combine them together to make sentences.

193
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:24,000
Make new words.

194
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:25,000
This kind of thing.

195
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:35,000
And so it's very interesting that the Chinese word for tower is grass plus clay plus mankind plus one mouth.

196
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:38,000
Everyone's speaking one way, one language.

197
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:39,000
Ah.

198
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:40,000
Ooh.

199
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:42,000
That actually sounds very convincing.

200
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:44,000
Except it's complete bullshit.

201
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:46,000
These elements are called components.

202
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:51,000
And it's true, you can often dissemble simple characters and get the meaning based on these.

203
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:56,000
For example, this is the character for a person, here in the form of a component called a radical.

204
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:59,000
And here's the character for a tree.

205
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:04,000
So if you have a person leaning against a tree, you have a character that means to rest.

206
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:05,000
Get it?

207
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:08,000
Characters like this are called associative.

208
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:15,000
But this one isn't associative, so you can't simply add up the various components and make your own little story.

209
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:18,000
This type of character is called pictophonetic.

210
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:22,000
Because while one component, the radical, gives a hint of the meaning,

211
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:26,000
the other component is purely there to indicate the sound.

212
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:28,000
We'll come to that in a minute.

213
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:36,000
First, let's embarrass creation ministries by showing not only how they don't understand the difference between associative and pictophonetic characters,

214
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:40,000
they don't even understand what the components in their example mean.

215
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:45,000
The key radical in the character for tower is this one, meaning earth.

216
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:49,000
It stands to reason because that's what early Chinese towers were made of.

217
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:55,000
But what's next to it is an archaic character that has two meanings, a small bean and thick.

218
00:14:55,000 --> 00:15:02,000
If we break it down, it's composed of the radicals for grass and this very common character meaning combine or unite.

219
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:11,000
But if we break it down further, creationist ministries is completely wrong in saying that this radical, meaning one, combines with a mouth to mean one voice.

220
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:17,000
It doesn't. It goes with the radical g, a person, to give us the meaning one people.

221
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:23,000
So one people at a gate gives us the character he, meaning assemble or come together.

222
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:24,000
Get it?

223
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:26,000
Nothing to do with one language at all.

224
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:32,000
But the whole exercise is pointless anyway, because as I said, this is a pictophonetic character.

225
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:40,000
This component is there to guide you towards the right pronunciation, which I hasten to add is not necessarily the one I've given you.

226
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:48,000
To use English as an analogy, the letter T in the word Britain is there because it tells you how to pronounce the word Britain.

227
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:53,000
It's not some secret code telling you ancient Britons used to drink tea.

228
00:15:53,000 --> 00:16:00,000
How do we know this? Because scholars have been studying these characters for hundreds of years and we can even see how they've evolved.

229
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:06,000
The first Chinese dictionary was published nearly 2000 years before the first English one.

230
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:08,000
Let me give a parallel example in English.

231
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:20,000
The word cupboard is a compound word, the equivalent of an associative Chinese character, because it puts two words together, cup and board, to describe something quite literally.

232
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:25,000
Even if you didn't know what a cupboard was, you could take the word apart and figure it out.

233
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:30,000
But you can't do that with most English words because they're purely phonetic.

234
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:41,000
You can't take the word ketchup and assume that each component is telling the story of a sailing boat being lifted into heaven, because that would be stupid, right creationists?

235
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:49,000
This desperate attempt to link Chinese characters to biblical stories has become a favourite among creationists, especially this one.

236
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:52,000
The Chinese word for create is za.

237
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:55,000
To create or creation.

238
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:56,000
The character for create.

239
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:58,000
Create in Chinese is the word za.

240
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:04,000
Before we hear more, let me first explain that this character once again is pictophonetic.

241
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:12,000
So while this radical walk indicates the meaning, the second component, which means to tell, is purely there to indicate the sound.

242
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:16,000
Ah, but let's watch as creationists unravel the character anyway.

243
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:22,000
I'm going to press a buzzer whenever they make a mistake, OK? Here we go.

244
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:24,000
So we have dust.

245
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:26,000
It is made up of dust.

246
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:29,000
OK, this part.

247
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:32,000
No, this part isn't a part.

248
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:39,000
I know it would be nice if there was a character for dust in there, because then it would fit the narrative, but there isn't.

249
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:42,000
This is the four-stroke radical for a cow.

250
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:50,000
Don't try to ignore this small stroke, because it means alive or to live.

251
00:17:50,000 --> 00:18:00,000
Sorry, but putting this and this together to invent some radical-meaning living dust not found in any Chinese dictionary is a complete load of baloney.

252
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:07,000
The reason Chinese scholars know this is a cow, and any Chinese etymological dictionary will tell you it's a cow,

253
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:15,000
is because the character zao, meaning build or make, has been written for thousands of years and its evolution has been documented.

254
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:21,000
Here's one of the oldest inscriptions dating back to the Bronze Age, showing that the pictograph is a cow.

255
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:24,000
That's what the character for a cow looked like back then.

256
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:29,000
And even though the length of the vertical stroke has shortened over the centuries, it's still a cow.

257
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:32,000
If I had a carton of Chinese milk, I could show you.

258
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:35,000
Oh, here's one. See? Cow!

259
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:43,000
So in the character for build or make, this doesn't mean dust, this doesn't mean life, and this doesn't even mean a man.

260
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:46,000
As we've seen, it means a mouth or an entrance.

261
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:52,000
You get all three wrong and still have the balls to tell me this made-up crap is in the Bible.

262
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:53,000
What a load of b-
