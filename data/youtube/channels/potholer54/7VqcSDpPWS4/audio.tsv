0	10000	In July of 2006, a team of very smart people, I mean these individuals are the type to do 5,000 piece puzzles on their break, okay?
10000	11000	You must be very smart!
11000	23000	They got together, convened from various disciplines, for the sole purpose of developing a definition for the word information.
23000	28000	They called it UDI. It's the Universal Definition of Information.
28000	32000	Yeah, yeah, very clever. But who are these very smart people?
32000	38000	Well, Werner Gitt is a creationist and Jason Lyle is a creationist.
38000	45000	John Sanford, Bob Compton, creationist, creationist. Hang on, I'm beginning to spot a pattern here.
45000	57000	So I wonder why Snarky Apologist didn't tell us that the entire list is composed of creationists who, not surprisingly, made the definition fit the conclusion they wanted to reach.
57000	66000	Which is that DNA is information and language is information, so if languages were designed, DNA must have been designed. I told you they were clever.
66000	71000	We know that information always, always, always comes from intelligence.
71000	78000	Problem is, creationists are in a bit of a catch-23, which is slightly different to Joseph Heller's catch-22.
78000	85000	Because if DNA is information, then we can't say that information is always, always, always designed, can we?
85000	93000	Because we don't know that DNA was designed, so either the rule is wrong or DNA isn't information. Take your pick.
93000	96000	And if it was designed, then who designed it?
96000	104000	Certainly none of the gods and goddesses on offer, because we know from scientific evidence that the feats attributed to them never happened.
104000	114000	The only god it could have been is one that sprinkled DNA on the Earth over three and a half billion years ago and then let it evolve, as the evidence clearly shows.
114000	118000	And I don't know of any religion that has that as its credo.
118000	123000	But what about languages themselves? Surely they were intelligently designed?
123000	130000	Many cultures didn't have words like transistor. They either had to make one or use the English version which was made up.
130000	139000	Why, that's new information! It's just like evolution, isn't it? No, those languages were intelligently designed.
139000	141000	Er, huh?
141000	147000	If you think languages are intelligently designed, Ian, well then, tell me who designed Italian?
147000	155000	Modern Italian evolved over several generations from Old Italian, which evolved from Latin, which evolved from an unknown Falcian language,
155000	161000	which, if we trace it all the way back, came from an ancestral Proto-European language.
161000	164000	There are intelligently designed languages, to be sure.
164000	173000	This is Klingon, and yes, someone with intelligence, arguably, did sit down and design it.
173000	177000	But Juby's talking about the languages we speak every day.
177000	185000	Of course some words, like transistor, were intelligently designed because when a new invention comes along someone has to give it a name.
185000	193000	But most of the words we use today weren't designed. They evolved from ancestral words through mispronunciation or dialect changes,
193000	196000	such as the great vowel shift in medieval English.
196000	203000	As people moved across Europe, the Sanskrit word pada became the Latin word ped and the Danish word fod,
203000	211000	and ultimately the English word foot, simply through subtle changes in the way succeeding generations pronounced vowels and consonants.
211000	217000	Some words, like de-evolution, come about because of ignorance of existing words.
217000	221000	The meaning of words can also change through common use and misuse.
221000	225000	Look at how the meaning of the word gay has changed in just a few generations,
225000	231000	and people are literally misusing the meaning of the words decimate and literally.
231000	236000	You only have to look at Anglo-Saxon or read Chaucer to see how the way we speak has changed,
236000	241000	and thanks to the medium of recording we can even hear it for ourselves.
241000	246000	The working class young man says that the shirt he admires is posh,
247000	252000	whereas the upper class young man would probably call it a peach.
252000	258000	Yes, this really is how we used to teach foreigners what's called the Queen's English in the 1960s.
258000	265000	In class-conscious England, using the wrong kind of slang can be very damaging socially.
265000	272000	On this record, all the idioms and the slang are in every way socially acceptable.
272000	276000	Hello, Johnny. You're looking a bit down. What's eating you?
276000	279000	Oh, I fluff my prelims.
279000	285000	Few people today have an accent like that, and fewer still would talk about fluffing their prelims,
285000	288000	unless they work in certain cinematic vocations.
288000	292000	This is also how the Queen used to speak back in 1957.
292000	297000	Because of these changes, I'm not surprised that many people feel lost
297000	301000	and unable to decide what to hold on to and what to discard.
301000	306000	But just listen to how her grandson's accent has changed just two generations on.
306000	310000	No matter what, you can progress with your life.
310000	313000	You can do things beyond any imagination that you ever thought was possible.
313000	317000	Creationists would no doubt call this change microevolution.
317000	321000	In other words, evolution we can actually see or hear.
321000	326000	But of course these small changes, given enough time, add up to big changes.
326000	328000	How can they not?
328000	332000	But I'm sure that in support of his case, Ian's going to give us a nice example,
332000	334000	in the medieval sense of the word.
334000	338000	Just like genetic information, languages are de-evolving.
338000	341000	They are becoming simpler, not more complex.
341000	346000	For example, English used to have masculinity and femininity applied to inanimate objects,
346000	348000	just like French does.
348000	350000	Yeah, a thousand years ago, Ian.
350000	355000	First of all, taking one example from that far back from just one of thousands of languages
355000	358000	is no evidence that all languages are becoming simpler.
358000	362000	In fact, if we look at English since it dropped grammatical genders,
362000	368000	it's got more complex in its vocabulary because it's had an infusion of thousands of new words.
368000	371000	Anglo-Saxon had about 30,000 words.
371000	375000	The Oxford English Dictionary lists 600,000 in modern English,
375000	378000	170,000 of which are still in use.
378000	381000	That aside, even Juby's premise is wrong.
381000	386000	Becoming simpler doesn't mean the language is, as Juby calls it, de-evolving.
386000	391000	Losing grammatical gender can be regarded as an improvement of the language.
391000	395000	After all, why do we need a house to be neuter, or a table to be masculine,
395000	400000	or a door to be feminine, as they are in our sister language, German?
400000	404000	For the word the, German has an entire table of words.
404000	408000	I love Germans, but sorry guys, your definite article sucks.
408000	411000	As for the French, you say, j'ai manger, j'ai bu,
411000	415000	but you say, je suis izale, what's wrong with you people?
415000	420000	If someone designed all this stuff, then he has to be either a sadist or a complete idiot.
420000	424000	When you look at a language that has been designed, like Esperanto,
424000	429000	the designer, Ludwig Zamenhof, did away with all these confusing rules
429000	433000	and irregular verbs and grammatical genders and made the language simple.
433000	436000	That's what denotes intelligent design.
436000	440000	Creationists like Juby are obsessed with what they call new information.
440000	441000	New information.
441000	442000	Gain in genetic information.
442000	444000	Genetic information.
444000	447000	To be class as evolution, they think a language and a species
447000	450000	must be infused with new information.
450000	454000	But of course, languages and species evolve by changing.
454000	457000	That's what evolution means.
457000	460000	So just because snakes lost their legs as they evolved
460000	464000	doesn't mean they've gone into a worse state or are going backwards.
464000	468000	They lost their legs because they adapted to a niche in which they didn't need legs
468000	473000	and in fact had a higher chance of surviving and passing on genes without them.
473000	477000	So the fact that languages evolve and we can see how they evolved
477000	482000	and we can hear them evolving makes for a very good analogy with biological evolution.
482000	486000	As a language splits through geographical separation and isolation,
486000	490000	at first the two daughter languages are mutually intelligible
490000	494000	just as animals, distantly related, can interbreed with difficulty.
494000	497000	Then they become mutually unintelligible.
497000	501000	French Canadians separated from French a few hundred years ago
501000	504000	but the languages are still mutually intelligible.
509000	511000	Well, okay, only just.
511000	515000	Even so, French Canadian movies have to be subtitled in France.
516000	520000	After further isolation, languages eventually become mutually unintelligible
520000	525000	just as time and isolation leads to new species that can't interbreed.
525000	528000	The language of Dutch speakers who migrated to South Africa
528000	533000	and cut themselves off from the mother country eventually became Afrikaans,
533000	537000	which my Flemish and Dutch friends say they can't understand.
537000	540000	And yet both came from the same ancestral language.
540000	546000	So language can be quite useful in explaining some misunderstood concepts in biological evolution.
546000	552000	For example, when I was explaining genetics in the video Human Ancestry Made Easy,
552000	558000	I said one piece of evidence as to our origins in East Africa is the rich variety of genes found there.
558000	564000	Populations that stay put and don't migrate will, of course, have a lot more of these genetic markers.
564000	569000	So it's not surprising that we find the greatest genetic diversity in Africa.
570000	576000	If we look at this in terms of language, the way language diverges into different accents and dialects
576000	581000	as population groups move apart leads to the same phenomenon.
581000	588000	Two recent studies found that most of the sounds or phonemes used to make language are found in Africa
588000	592000	and the number decreases the further away from Africa you go.
592000	598000	This parallels exactly the path taken by our genes in both time and space.
598000	606000	It confirms that all the world's languages derive from a common East African language about 150,000 years ago,
606000	608000	just as our genes do.
608000	611000	Let me give you an example closer to home.
611000	617000	Drive 20 miles west from the centre of Manchester and most people have a completely different accent.
617000	619000	They sound like John Bishop.
619000	622000	Is it better if they had a funny death?
622000	623000	The what?
623000	624000	A funny death.
624000	625000	A phony death?
625000	626000	No, a funny one.
627000	628000	A funny one.
629000	631000	Anybody understand what he's saying?
631000	632000	Yes, everyone.
634000	635000	He thinks I'm Hungarian.
638000	640000	Now is it kind of every second word or none of it?
640000	641000	Every second.
641000	642000	It's about every third or fourth.
644000	646000	This could be quite a long show.
647000	653000	We were talking backstage to the vacuum about coming to Liverpool and we have different accents
653000	656000	very, very close to each other all over England, isn't it?
656000	658000	All over Britain it's very, very different accents.
658000	663000	Mainly because if people speak different than you, it gives you a reason to hate them.
666000	668000	Could you do an English accent?
668000	670000	Could I do an English accent?
672000	675000	Drive 60 miles in the opposite direction and they sound like...
675000	676000	Oh, yeah, Bruno and Steve.
676000	680000	Yeah, I'm sure there was, you know, obviously there was one, there was the boys, really.
680000	683000	I mean, there was ones coming up with this, all these fancy ideas of dual-acting pistons
683000	684000	and heater tubes and all that.
684000	685000	Fair play, old boys.
685000	688000	But they weren't the boys machining till we found out, was they?
688000	689000	Was they?
689000	690000	Eh?
690000	691000	You're right.
691000	695000	A proverbial Martian would be able to tell very easily that American English derived
695000	700000	from British English and not the other way round simply because of the richness of different
700000	704000	accents in the UK compared to the United States.
704000	706000	Here they are on the same scale.
706000	711000	In exactly the same way, one of the ways we know that humans originated in Africa is
711000	714000	because of the richness of the gene pool found there.
715000	718000	And in answer to the creationist's often asked question,
718000	721000	if humans evolved from monkeys, why do we still have monkeys?
721000	727000	Well, it's like asking if Afrikaans evolved from Dutch, why do we still have Dutch?
727000	728000	Duh.
729000	735000	If languages didn't evolve and no humans designed them, then what's the creationist alternative?
735000	741000	Well, here's Conservopedia pushing the anti-science viewpoint with a familiar tactic.
741000	743000	Pretend there's a debate among scientists.
744000	749000	The only alternative offered up by Conservopedia is that language has popped out of nowhere
749000	751000	just as all the animals and plants did.
751000	754000	And what's its source for this fact?
754000	755000	Its only reference?
755000	756000	This.
756000	758000	A passage from the Bible.
758000	763000	It describes how people got together after the flood and cooperated in building a town
763000	764000	and a tower.
764000	765000	Well, that sounds nice.
765000	768000	And, of course, God wasn't too happy about that.
769000	772000	If, as one people speaking the same language, they have begun to do this,
772000	775000	then nothing they plan to do will be impossible for them.
775000	780000	Come, let us go down and confuse their language so they will not understand each other.
780000	781000	Thanks, God.
781000	786000	So is there any evidence for this Tower of Babel anywhere except the Bible?
786000	787000	Of course not.
787000	791000	No archaeological or linguistic or genetic evidence at all.
791000	794000	So creationists have had to pluck one out of thin air.
794000	796000	This is the Chinese written language.
796000	798000	Of course they use pictographs.
798000	801000	Images that they will use to make up different words
801000	803000	and then they'll combine them together to make sentences.
803000	804000	Make new words.
804000	805000	This kind of thing.
805000	815000	And so it's very interesting that the Chinese word for tower is grass plus clay plus mankind plus one mouth.
815000	818000	Everyone's speaking one way, one language.
818000	819000	Ah.
819000	820000	Ooh.
820000	822000	That actually sounds very convincing.
822000	824000	Except it's complete bullshit.
824000	826000	These elements are called components.
826000	831000	And it's true, you can often dissemble simple characters and get the meaning based on these.
831000	836000	For example, this is the character for a person, here in the form of a component called a radical.
836000	839000	And here's the character for a tree.
839000	844000	So if you have a person leaning against a tree, you have a character that means to rest.
844000	845000	Get it?
845000	848000	Characters like this are called associative.
848000	855000	But this one isn't associative, so you can't simply add up the various components and make your own little story.
855000	858000	This type of character is called pictophonetic.
858000	862000	Because while one component, the radical, gives a hint of the meaning,
862000	866000	the other component is purely there to indicate the sound.
866000	868000	We'll come to that in a minute.
868000	876000	First, let's embarrass creation ministries by showing not only how they don't understand the difference between associative and pictophonetic characters,
876000	880000	they don't even understand what the components in their example mean.
880000	885000	The key radical in the character for tower is this one, meaning earth.
885000	889000	It stands to reason because that's what early Chinese towers were made of.
889000	895000	But what's next to it is an archaic character that has two meanings, a small bean and thick.
895000	902000	If we break it down, it's composed of the radicals for grass and this very common character meaning combine or unite.
902000	911000	But if we break it down further, creationist ministries is completely wrong in saying that this radical, meaning one, combines with a mouth to mean one voice.
911000	917000	It doesn't. It goes with the radical g, a person, to give us the meaning one people.
917000	923000	So one people at a gate gives us the character he, meaning assemble or come together.
923000	924000	Get it?
924000	926000	Nothing to do with one language at all.
927000	932000	But the whole exercise is pointless anyway, because as I said, this is a pictophonetic character.
932000	940000	This component is there to guide you towards the right pronunciation, which I hasten to add is not necessarily the one I've given you.
940000	948000	To use English as an analogy, the letter T in the word Britain is there because it tells you how to pronounce the word Britain.
948000	953000	It's not some secret code telling you ancient Britons used to drink tea.
953000	960000	How do we know this? Because scholars have been studying these characters for hundreds of years and we can even see how they've evolved.
960000	966000	The first Chinese dictionary was published nearly 2000 years before the first English one.
966000	968000	Let me give a parallel example in English.
968000	980000	The word cupboard is a compound word, the equivalent of an associative Chinese character, because it puts two words together, cup and board, to describe something quite literally.
980000	985000	Even if you didn't know what a cupboard was, you could take the word apart and figure it out.
985000	990000	But you can't do that with most English words because they're purely phonetic.
990000	1001000	You can't take the word ketchup and assume that each component is telling the story of a sailing boat being lifted into heaven, because that would be stupid, right creationists?
1001000	1009000	This desperate attempt to link Chinese characters to biblical stories has become a favourite among creationists, especially this one.
1009000	1012000	The Chinese word for create is za.
1012000	1015000	To create or creation.
1015000	1016000	The character for create.
1016000	1018000	Create in Chinese is the word za.
1018000	1024000	Before we hear more, let me first explain that this character once again is pictophonetic.
1024000	1032000	So while this radical walk indicates the meaning, the second component, which means to tell, is purely there to indicate the sound.
1032000	1036000	Ah, but let's watch as creationists unravel the character anyway.
1037000	1042000	I'm going to press a buzzer whenever they make a mistake, OK? Here we go.
1042000	1044000	So we have dust.
1044000	1046000	It is made up of dust.
1046000	1049000	OK, this part.
1049000	1052000	No, this part isn't a part.
1052000	1059000	I know it would be nice if there was a character for dust in there, because then it would fit the narrative, but there isn't.
1059000	1062000	This is the four-stroke radical for a cow.
1062000	1070000	Don't try to ignore this small stroke, because it means alive or to live.
1070000	1080000	Sorry, but putting this and this together to invent some radical-meaning living dust not found in any Chinese dictionary is a complete load of baloney.
1080000	1087000	The reason Chinese scholars know this is a cow, and any Chinese etymological dictionary will tell you it's a cow,
1087000	1095000	is because the character zao, meaning build or make, has been written for thousands of years and its evolution has been documented.
1095000	1101000	Here's one of the oldest inscriptions dating back to the Bronze Age, showing that the pictograph is a cow.
1101000	1104000	That's what the character for a cow looked like back then.
1104000	1109000	And even though the length of the vertical stroke has shortened over the centuries, it's still a cow.
1109000	1112000	If I had a carton of Chinese milk, I could show you.
1112000	1115000	Oh, here's one. See? Cow!
1115000	1123000	So in the character for build or make, this doesn't mean dust, this doesn't mean life, and this doesn't even mean a man.
