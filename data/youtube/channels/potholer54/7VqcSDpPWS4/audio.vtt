00:00.000 --> 00:10.000
In July of 2006, a team of very smart people, I mean these individuals are the type to do 5,000 piece puzzles on their break, okay?

00:10.000 --> 00:11.000
You must be very smart!

00:11.000 --> 00:23.000
They got together, convened from various disciplines, for the sole purpose of developing a definition for the word information.

00:23.000 --> 00:28.000
They called it UDI. It's the Universal Definition of Information.

00:28.000 --> 00:32.000
Yeah, yeah, very clever. But who are these very smart people?

00:32.000 --> 00:38.000
Well, Werner Gitt is a creationist and Jason Lyle is a creationist.

00:38.000 --> 00:45.000
John Sanford, Bob Compton, creationist, creationist. Hang on, I'm beginning to spot a pattern here.

00:45.000 --> 00:57.000
So I wonder why Snarky Apologist didn't tell us that the entire list is composed of creationists who, not surprisingly, made the definition fit the conclusion they wanted to reach.

00:57.000 --> 01:06.000
Which is that DNA is information and language is information, so if languages were designed, DNA must have been designed. I told you they were clever.

01:06.000 --> 01:11.000
We know that information always, always, always comes from intelligence.

01:11.000 --> 01:18.000
Problem is, creationists are in a bit of a catch-23, which is slightly different to Joseph Heller's catch-22.

01:18.000 --> 01:25.000
Because if DNA is information, then we can't say that information is always, always, always designed, can we?

01:25.000 --> 01:33.000
Because we don't know that DNA was designed, so either the rule is wrong or DNA isn't information. Take your pick.

01:33.000 --> 01:36.000
And if it was designed, then who designed it?

01:36.000 --> 01:44.000
Certainly none of the gods and goddesses on offer, because we know from scientific evidence that the feats attributed to them never happened.

01:44.000 --> 01:54.000
The only god it could have been is one that sprinkled DNA on the Earth over three and a half billion years ago and then let it evolve, as the evidence clearly shows.

01:54.000 --> 01:58.000
And I don't know of any religion that has that as its credo.

01:58.000 --> 02:03.000
But what about languages themselves? Surely they were intelligently designed?

02:03.000 --> 02:10.000
Many cultures didn't have words like transistor. They either had to make one or use the English version which was made up.

02:10.000 --> 02:19.000
Why, that's new information! It's just like evolution, isn't it? No, those languages were intelligently designed.

02:19.000 --> 02:21.000
Er, huh?

02:21.000 --> 02:27.000
If you think languages are intelligently designed, Ian, well then, tell me who designed Italian?

02:27.000 --> 02:35.000
Modern Italian evolved over several generations from Old Italian, which evolved from Latin, which evolved from an unknown Falcian language,

02:35.000 --> 02:41.000
which, if we trace it all the way back, came from an ancestral Proto-European language.

02:41.000 --> 02:44.000
There are intelligently designed languages, to be sure.

02:44.000 --> 02:53.000
This is Klingon, and yes, someone with intelligence, arguably, did sit down and design it.

02:53.000 --> 02:57.000
But Juby's talking about the languages we speak every day.

02:57.000 --> 03:05.000
Of course some words, like transistor, were intelligently designed because when a new invention comes along someone has to give it a name.

03:05.000 --> 03:13.000
But most of the words we use today weren't designed. They evolved from ancestral words through mispronunciation or dialect changes,

03:13.000 --> 03:16.000
such as the great vowel shift in medieval English.

03:16.000 --> 03:23.000
As people moved across Europe, the Sanskrit word pada became the Latin word ped and the Danish word fod,

03:23.000 --> 03:31.000
and ultimately the English word foot, simply through subtle changes in the way succeeding generations pronounced vowels and consonants.

03:31.000 --> 03:37.000
Some words, like de-evolution, come about because of ignorance of existing words.

03:37.000 --> 03:41.000
The meaning of words can also change through common use and misuse.

03:41.000 --> 03:45.000
Look at how the meaning of the word gay has changed in just a few generations,

03:45.000 --> 03:51.000
and people are literally misusing the meaning of the words decimate and literally.

03:51.000 --> 03:56.000
You only have to look at Anglo-Saxon or read Chaucer to see how the way we speak has changed,

03:56.000 --> 04:01.000
and thanks to the medium of recording we can even hear it for ourselves.

04:01.000 --> 04:06.000
The working class young man says that the shirt he admires is posh,

04:07.000 --> 04:12.000
whereas the upper class young man would probably call it a peach.

04:12.000 --> 04:18.000
Yes, this really is how we used to teach foreigners what's called the Queen's English in the 1960s.

04:18.000 --> 04:25.000
In class-conscious England, using the wrong kind of slang can be very damaging socially.

04:25.000 --> 04:32.000
On this record, all the idioms and the slang are in every way socially acceptable.

04:32.000 --> 04:36.000
Hello, Johnny. You're looking a bit down. What's eating you?

04:36.000 --> 04:39.000
Oh, I fluff my prelims.

04:39.000 --> 04:45.000
Few people today have an accent like that, and fewer still would talk about fluffing their prelims,

04:45.000 --> 04:48.000
unless they work in certain cinematic vocations.

04:48.000 --> 04:52.000
This is also how the Queen used to speak back in 1957.

04:52.000 --> 04:57.000
Because of these changes, I'm not surprised that many people feel lost

04:57.000 --> 05:01.000
and unable to decide what to hold on to and what to discard.

05:01.000 --> 05:06.000
But just listen to how her grandson's accent has changed just two generations on.

05:06.000 --> 05:10.000
No matter what, you can progress with your life.

05:10.000 --> 05:13.000
You can do things beyond any imagination that you ever thought was possible.

05:13.000 --> 05:17.000
Creationists would no doubt call this change microevolution.

05:17.000 --> 05:21.000
In other words, evolution we can actually see or hear.

05:21.000 --> 05:26.000
But of course these small changes, given enough time, add up to big changes.

05:26.000 --> 05:28.000
How can they not?

05:28.000 --> 05:32.000
But I'm sure that in support of his case, Ian's going to give us a nice example,

05:32.000 --> 05:34.000
in the medieval sense of the word.

05:34.000 --> 05:38.000
Just like genetic information, languages are de-evolving.

05:38.000 --> 05:41.000
They are becoming simpler, not more complex.

05:41.000 --> 05:46.000
For example, English used to have masculinity and femininity applied to inanimate objects,

05:46.000 --> 05:48.000
just like French does.

05:48.000 --> 05:50.000
Yeah, a thousand years ago, Ian.

05:50.000 --> 05:55.000
First of all, taking one example from that far back from just one of thousands of languages

05:55.000 --> 05:58.000
is no evidence that all languages are becoming simpler.

05:58.000 --> 06:02.000
In fact, if we look at English since it dropped grammatical genders,

06:02.000 --> 06:08.000
it's got more complex in its vocabulary because it's had an infusion of thousands of new words.

06:08.000 --> 06:11.000
Anglo-Saxon had about 30,000 words.

06:11.000 --> 06:15.000
The Oxford English Dictionary lists 600,000 in modern English,

06:15.000 --> 06:18.000
170,000 of which are still in use.

06:18.000 --> 06:21.000
That aside, even Juby's premise is wrong.

06:21.000 --> 06:26.000
Becoming simpler doesn't mean the language is, as Juby calls it, de-evolving.

06:26.000 --> 06:31.000
Losing grammatical gender can be regarded as an improvement of the language.

06:31.000 --> 06:35.000
After all, why do we need a house to be neuter, or a table to be masculine,

06:35.000 --> 06:40.000
or a door to be feminine, as they are in our sister language, German?

06:40.000 --> 06:44.000
For the word the, German has an entire table of words.

06:44.000 --> 06:48.000
I love Germans, but sorry guys, your definite article sucks.

06:48.000 --> 06:51.000
As for the French, you say, j'ai manger, j'ai bu,

06:51.000 --> 06:55.000
but you say, je suis izale, what's wrong with you people?

06:55.000 --> 07:00.000
If someone designed all this stuff, then he has to be either a sadist or a complete idiot.

07:00.000 --> 07:04.000
When you look at a language that has been designed, like Esperanto,

07:04.000 --> 07:09.000
the designer, Ludwig Zamenhof, did away with all these confusing rules

07:09.000 --> 07:13.000
and irregular verbs and grammatical genders and made the language simple.

07:13.000 --> 07:16.000
That's what denotes intelligent design.

07:16.000 --> 07:20.000
Creationists like Juby are obsessed with what they call new information.

07:20.000 --> 07:21.000
New information.

07:21.000 --> 07:22.000
Gain in genetic information.

07:22.000 --> 07:24.000
Genetic information.

07:24.000 --> 07:27.000
To be class as evolution, they think a language and a species

07:27.000 --> 07:30.000
must be infused with new information.

07:30.000 --> 07:34.000
But of course, languages and species evolve by changing.

07:34.000 --> 07:37.000
That's what evolution means.

07:37.000 --> 07:40.000
So just because snakes lost their legs as they evolved

07:40.000 --> 07:44.000
doesn't mean they've gone into a worse state or are going backwards.

07:44.000 --> 07:48.000
They lost their legs because they adapted to a niche in which they didn't need legs

07:48.000 --> 07:53.000
and in fact had a higher chance of surviving and passing on genes without them.

07:53.000 --> 07:57.000
So the fact that languages evolve and we can see how they evolved

07:57.000 --> 08:02.000
and we can hear them evolving makes for a very good analogy with biological evolution.

08:02.000 --> 08:06.000
As a language splits through geographical separation and isolation,

08:06.000 --> 08:10.000
at first the two daughter languages are mutually intelligible

08:10.000 --> 08:14.000
just as animals, distantly related, can interbreed with difficulty.

08:14.000 --> 08:17.000
Then they become mutually unintelligible.

08:17.000 --> 08:21.000
French Canadians separated from French a few hundred years ago

08:21.000 --> 08:24.000
but the languages are still mutually intelligible.

08:29.000 --> 08:31.000
Well, okay, only just.

08:31.000 --> 08:35.000
Even so, French Canadian movies have to be subtitled in France.

08:36.000 --> 08:40.000
After further isolation, languages eventually become mutually unintelligible

08:40.000 --> 08:45.000
just as time and isolation leads to new species that can't interbreed.

08:45.000 --> 08:48.000
The language of Dutch speakers who migrated to South Africa

08:48.000 --> 08:53.000
and cut themselves off from the mother country eventually became Afrikaans,

08:53.000 --> 08:57.000
which my Flemish and Dutch friends say they can't understand.

08:57.000 --> 09:00.000
And yet both came from the same ancestral language.

09:00.000 --> 09:06.000
So language can be quite useful in explaining some misunderstood concepts in biological evolution.

09:06.000 --> 09:12.000
For example, when I was explaining genetics in the video Human Ancestry Made Easy,

09:12.000 --> 09:18.000
I said one piece of evidence as to our origins in East Africa is the rich variety of genes found there.

09:18.000 --> 09:24.000
Populations that stay put and don't migrate will, of course, have a lot more of these genetic markers.

09:24.000 --> 09:29.000
So it's not surprising that we find the greatest genetic diversity in Africa.

09:30.000 --> 09:36.000
If we look at this in terms of language, the way language diverges into different accents and dialects

09:36.000 --> 09:41.000
as population groups move apart leads to the same phenomenon.

09:41.000 --> 09:48.000
Two recent studies found that most of the sounds or phonemes used to make language are found in Africa

09:48.000 --> 09:52.000
and the number decreases the further away from Africa you go.

09:52.000 --> 09:58.000
This parallels exactly the path taken by our genes in both time and space.

09:58.000 --> 10:06.000
It confirms that all the world's languages derive from a common East African language about 150,000 years ago,

10:06.000 --> 10:08.000
just as our genes do.

10:08.000 --> 10:11.000
Let me give you an example closer to home.

10:11.000 --> 10:17.000
Drive 20 miles west from the centre of Manchester and most people have a completely different accent.

10:17.000 --> 10:19.000
They sound like John Bishop.

10:19.000 --> 10:22.000
Is it better if they had a funny death?

10:22.000 --> 10:23.000
The what?

10:23.000 --> 10:24.000
A funny death.

10:24.000 --> 10:25.000
A phony death?

10:25.000 --> 10:26.000
No, a funny one.

10:27.000 --> 10:28.000
A funny one.

10:29.000 --> 10:31.000
Anybody understand what he's saying?

10:31.000 --> 10:32.000
Yes, everyone.

10:34.000 --> 10:35.000
He thinks I'm Hungarian.

10:38.000 --> 10:40.000
Now is it kind of every second word or none of it?

10:40.000 --> 10:41.000
Every second.

10:41.000 --> 10:42.000
It's about every third or fourth.

10:44.000 --> 10:46.000
This could be quite a long show.

10:47.000 --> 10:53.000
We were talking backstage to the vacuum about coming to Liverpool and we have different accents

10:53.000 --> 10:56.000
very, very close to each other all over England, isn't it?

10:56.000 --> 10:58.000
All over Britain it's very, very different accents.

10:58.000 --> 11:03.000
Mainly because if people speak different than you, it gives you a reason to hate them.

11:06.000 --> 11:08.000
Could you do an English accent?

11:08.000 --> 11:10.000
Could I do an English accent?

11:12.000 --> 11:15.000
Drive 60 miles in the opposite direction and they sound like...

11:15.000 --> 11:16.000
Oh, yeah, Bruno and Steve.

11:16.000 --> 11:20.000
Yeah, I'm sure there was, you know, obviously there was one, there was the boys, really.

11:20.000 --> 11:23.000
I mean, there was ones coming up with this, all these fancy ideas of dual-acting pistons

11:23.000 --> 11:24.000
and heater tubes and all that.

11:24.000 --> 11:25.000
Fair play, old boys.

11:25.000 --> 11:28.000
But they weren't the boys machining till we found out, was they?

11:28.000 --> 11:29.000
Was they?

11:29.000 --> 11:30.000
Eh?

11:30.000 --> 11:31.000
You're right.

11:31.000 --> 11:35.000
A proverbial Martian would be able to tell very easily that American English derived

11:35.000 --> 11:40.000
from British English and not the other way round simply because of the richness of different

11:40.000 --> 11:44.000
accents in the UK compared to the United States.

11:44.000 --> 11:46.000
Here they are on the same scale.

11:46.000 --> 11:51.000
In exactly the same way, one of the ways we know that humans originated in Africa is

11:51.000 --> 11:54.000
because of the richness of the gene pool found there.

11:55.000 --> 11:58.000
And in answer to the creationist's often asked question,

11:58.000 --> 12:01.000
if humans evolved from monkeys, why do we still have monkeys?

12:01.000 --> 12:07.000
Well, it's like asking if Afrikaans evolved from Dutch, why do we still have Dutch?

12:07.000 --> 12:08.000
Duh.

12:09.000 --> 12:15.000
If languages didn't evolve and no humans designed them, then what's the creationist alternative?

12:15.000 --> 12:21.000
Well, here's Conservopedia pushing the anti-science viewpoint with a familiar tactic.

12:21.000 --> 12:23.000
Pretend there's a debate among scientists.

12:24.000 --> 12:29.000
The only alternative offered up by Conservopedia is that language has popped out of nowhere

12:29.000 --> 12:31.000
just as all the animals and plants did.

12:31.000 --> 12:34.000
And what's its source for this fact?

12:34.000 --> 12:35.000
Its only reference?

12:35.000 --> 12:36.000
This.

12:36.000 --> 12:38.000
A passage from the Bible.

12:38.000 --> 12:43.000
It describes how people got together after the flood and cooperated in building a town

12:43.000 --> 12:44.000
and a tower.

12:44.000 --> 12:45.000
Well, that sounds nice.

12:45.000 --> 12:48.000
And, of course, God wasn't too happy about that.

12:49.000 --> 12:52.000
If, as one people speaking the same language, they have begun to do this,

12:52.000 --> 12:55.000
then nothing they plan to do will be impossible for them.

12:55.000 --> 13:00.000
Come, let us go down and confuse their language so they will not understand each other.

13:00.000 --> 13:01.000
Thanks, God.

13:01.000 --> 13:06.000
So is there any evidence for this Tower of Babel anywhere except the Bible?

13:06.000 --> 13:07.000
Of course not.

13:07.000 --> 13:11.000
No archaeological or linguistic or genetic evidence at all.

13:11.000 --> 13:14.000
So creationists have had to pluck one out of thin air.

13:14.000 --> 13:16.000
This is the Chinese written language.

13:16.000 --> 13:18.000
Of course they use pictographs.

13:18.000 --> 13:21.000
Images that they will use to make up different words

13:21.000 --> 13:23.000
and then they'll combine them together to make sentences.

13:23.000 --> 13:24.000
Make new words.

13:24.000 --> 13:25.000
This kind of thing.

13:25.000 --> 13:35.000
And so it's very interesting that the Chinese word for tower is grass plus clay plus mankind plus one mouth.

13:35.000 --> 13:38.000
Everyone's speaking one way, one language.

13:38.000 --> 13:39.000
Ah.

13:39.000 --> 13:40.000
Ooh.

13:40.000 --> 13:42.000
That actually sounds very convincing.

13:42.000 --> 13:44.000
Except it's complete bullshit.

13:44.000 --> 13:46.000
These elements are called components.

13:46.000 --> 13:51.000
And it's true, you can often dissemble simple characters and get the meaning based on these.

13:51.000 --> 13:56.000
For example, this is the character for a person, here in the form of a component called a radical.

13:56.000 --> 13:59.000
And here's the character for a tree.

13:59.000 --> 14:04.000
So if you have a person leaning against a tree, you have a character that means to rest.

14:04.000 --> 14:05.000
Get it?

14:05.000 --> 14:08.000
Characters like this are called associative.

14:08.000 --> 14:15.000
But this one isn't associative, so you can't simply add up the various components and make your own little story.

14:15.000 --> 14:18.000
This type of character is called pictophonetic.

14:18.000 --> 14:22.000
Because while one component, the radical, gives a hint of the meaning,

14:22.000 --> 14:26.000
the other component is purely there to indicate the sound.

14:26.000 --> 14:28.000
We'll come to that in a minute.

14:28.000 --> 14:36.000
First, let's embarrass creation ministries by showing not only how they don't understand the difference between associative and pictophonetic characters,

14:36.000 --> 14:40.000
they don't even understand what the components in their example mean.

14:40.000 --> 14:45.000
The key radical in the character for tower is this one, meaning earth.

14:45.000 --> 14:49.000
It stands to reason because that's what early Chinese towers were made of.

14:49.000 --> 14:55.000
But what's next to it is an archaic character that has two meanings, a small bean and thick.

14:55.000 --> 15:02.000
If we break it down, it's composed of the radicals for grass and this very common character meaning combine or unite.

15:02.000 --> 15:11.000
But if we break it down further, creationist ministries is completely wrong in saying that this radical, meaning one, combines with a mouth to mean one voice.

15:11.000 --> 15:17.000
It doesn't. It goes with the radical g, a person, to give us the meaning one people.

15:17.000 --> 15:23.000
So one people at a gate gives us the character he, meaning assemble or come together.

15:23.000 --> 15:24.000
Get it?

15:24.000 --> 15:26.000
Nothing to do with one language at all.

15:27.000 --> 15:32.000
But the whole exercise is pointless anyway, because as I said, this is a pictophonetic character.

15:32.000 --> 15:40.000
This component is there to guide you towards the right pronunciation, which I hasten to add is not necessarily the one I've given you.

15:40.000 --> 15:48.000
To use English as an analogy, the letter T in the word Britain is there because it tells you how to pronounce the word Britain.

15:48.000 --> 15:53.000
It's not some secret code telling you ancient Britons used to drink tea.

15:53.000 --> 16:00.000
How do we know this? Because scholars have been studying these characters for hundreds of years and we can even see how they've evolved.

16:00.000 --> 16:06.000
The first Chinese dictionary was published nearly 2000 years before the first English one.

16:06.000 --> 16:08.000
Let me give a parallel example in English.

16:08.000 --> 16:20.000
The word cupboard is a compound word, the equivalent of an associative Chinese character, because it puts two words together, cup and board, to describe something quite literally.

16:20.000 --> 16:25.000
Even if you didn't know what a cupboard was, you could take the word apart and figure it out.

16:25.000 --> 16:30.000
But you can't do that with most English words because they're purely phonetic.

16:30.000 --> 16:41.000
You can't take the word ketchup and assume that each component is telling the story of a sailing boat being lifted into heaven, because that would be stupid, right creationists?

16:41.000 --> 16:49.000
This desperate attempt to link Chinese characters to biblical stories has become a favourite among creationists, especially this one.

16:49.000 --> 16:52.000
The Chinese word for create is za.

16:52.000 --> 16:55.000
To create or creation.

16:55.000 --> 16:56.000
The character for create.

16:56.000 --> 16:58.000
Create in Chinese is the word za.

16:58.000 --> 17:04.000
Before we hear more, let me first explain that this character once again is pictophonetic.

17:04.000 --> 17:12.000
So while this radical walk indicates the meaning, the second component, which means to tell, is purely there to indicate the sound.

17:12.000 --> 17:16.000
Ah, but let's watch as creationists unravel the character anyway.

17:17.000 --> 17:22.000
I'm going to press a buzzer whenever they make a mistake, OK? Here we go.

17:22.000 --> 17:24.000
So we have dust.

17:24.000 --> 17:26.000
It is made up of dust.

17:26.000 --> 17:29.000
OK, this part.

17:29.000 --> 17:32.000
No, this part isn't a part.

17:32.000 --> 17:39.000
I know it would be nice if there was a character for dust in there, because then it would fit the narrative, but there isn't.

17:39.000 --> 17:42.000
This is the four-stroke radical for a cow.

17:42.000 --> 17:50.000
Don't try to ignore this small stroke, because it means alive or to live.

17:50.000 --> 18:00.000
Sorry, but putting this and this together to invent some radical-meaning living dust not found in any Chinese dictionary is a complete load of baloney.

18:00.000 --> 18:07.000
The reason Chinese scholars know this is a cow, and any Chinese etymological dictionary will tell you it's a cow,

18:07.000 --> 18:15.000
is because the character zao, meaning build or make, has been written for thousands of years and its evolution has been documented.

18:15.000 --> 18:21.000
Here's one of the oldest inscriptions dating back to the Bronze Age, showing that the pictograph is a cow.

18:21.000 --> 18:24.000
That's what the character for a cow looked like back then.

18:24.000 --> 18:29.000
And even though the length of the vertical stroke has shortened over the centuries, it's still a cow.

18:29.000 --> 18:32.000
If I had a carton of Chinese milk, I could show you.

18:32.000 --> 18:35.000
Oh, here's one. See? Cow!

18:35.000 --> 18:43.000
So in the character for build or make, this doesn't mean dust, this doesn't mean life, and this doesn't even mean a man.

18:43.000 --> 18:46.000
As we've seen, it means a mouth or an entrance.

18:46.000 --> 18:52.000
You get all three wrong and still have the balls to tell me this made-up crap is in the Bible.

18:52.000 --> 18:53.000
What a load of b-
