00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,740
The first time I uploaded this video I was hit with a wave of posts from people who pointed

2
00:00:04,740 --> 00:00:10,160
out a minor error – that I had described the founder of PragerU as a Christian rather

3
00:00:10,160 --> 00:00:11,760
than a Jew.

4
00:00:11,760 --> 00:00:18,120
That makes absolutely no difference to PragerU's misrepresentation of science by its two presenters,

5
00:00:18,120 --> 00:00:22,780
but even after I issued an immediate correction the posts still kept coming.

6
00:00:22,780 --> 00:00:26,920
So I decided to eliminate this distraction and re-edit the video.

7
00:00:26,920 --> 00:00:31,720
It'll be interesting to see if the complainants are now willing to show equal indignation

8
00:00:31,720 --> 00:00:33,320
at PragerU's errors.

9
00:00:33,320 --> 00:00:36,600
I'll discuss this in more detail later in the video.

10
00:00:36,600 --> 00:00:37,800
Thanks for watching.

11
00:00:37,800 --> 00:00:44,600
Perhaps the best arguments for his existence come from, of all places, science itself.

12
00:00:44,600 --> 00:00:45,880
Scientific evidence for God.

13
00:00:45,880 --> 00:00:47,760
Sounds convincing.

14
00:00:47,760 --> 00:00:53,320
I first encountered Prager University, PragerU, when I did a video a few months ago debunking

15
00:00:53,320 --> 00:00:54,520
Patrick Moore.

16
00:00:54,520 --> 00:00:57,400
Each week PragerU offers a new course.

17
00:00:57,400 --> 00:01:03,700
Each week we teach what isn't taught, what should be, how faith, reason and science are

18
00:01:03,700 --> 00:01:05,400
fully compatible.

19
00:01:05,400 --> 00:01:10,640
It's different from most universities in that it's not an accredited university.

20
00:01:10,640 --> 00:01:14,480
It's a video channel run by a religious talk radio host.

21
00:01:14,480 --> 00:01:17,680
It doesn't have a campus or any degrees.

22
00:01:17,680 --> 00:01:23,080
After I watched the video Science vs God, or as PragerU put it, completed the course,

23
00:01:23,080 --> 00:01:25,880
I didn't get a degree but I did earn a badge.

24
00:01:25,880 --> 00:01:27,800
I'm wearing it now.

25
00:01:27,800 --> 00:01:31,440
So what is the scientific evidence for God?

26
00:01:31,440 --> 00:01:35,480
It turns out it's just a repeat of an old creationist's claim that the universe is finely

27
00:01:35,480 --> 00:01:39,340
tuned and something finely tuned is impossible.

28
00:01:39,340 --> 00:01:43,120
So something else that's finely tuned must have caused it.

29
00:01:43,120 --> 00:01:46,480
Which of course doesn't make any sense but we'll come onto that in a minute.

30
00:01:46,480 --> 00:01:50,660
And the other scientific evidence is that the number of planets in our galaxy harbouring

31
00:01:50,660 --> 00:01:54,080
life is probably only a few thousand.

32
00:01:54,080 --> 00:01:56,020
So what's the story, Eric?

33
00:01:56,020 --> 00:01:57,460
Here's the story.

34
00:01:57,460 --> 00:02:02,500
The same year Time featured its now famous headline, the astronomer Carl Sagan announced

35
00:02:02,500 --> 00:02:07,440
that there were two necessary criteria for a planet to support life – the right kind

36
00:02:07,440 --> 00:02:11,700
of star and a planet the right distance from that star.

37
00:02:11,700 --> 00:02:17,180
Given the roughly octillion planets in the universe – that's one followed by 24 zeros

38
00:02:17,980 --> 00:02:22,020
– there should have been about septillion planets – that's one followed by 21 zeros

39
00:02:22,020 --> 00:02:24,900
– capable of supporting life.

40
00:02:24,900 --> 00:02:30,660
With such spectacular odds, scientists were optimistic that the search for extraterrestrial

41
00:02:30,660 --> 00:02:36,700
intelligence known by its initials S.E.T.I., an ambitious project launched in the 1960s,

42
00:02:36,700 --> 00:02:39,180
was sure to turn up something soon.

43
00:02:39,180 --> 00:02:44,540
With a vast radio telescopic network, scientists listened for signals that resembled coded

44
00:02:44,540 --> 00:02:45,540
intelligence.

45
00:02:45,540 --> 00:02:49,620
As the years passed, the silence from the universe was deafening.

46
00:02:49,620 --> 00:02:51,380
OK, couple of things here.

47
00:02:51,380 --> 00:02:54,820
Firstly, S.E.T.I. wasn't listening in on the whole universe.

48
00:02:54,820 --> 00:03:00,180
It was listening in on only a fraction of one galaxy out of a hundred billion galaxies

49
00:03:00,180 --> 00:03:01,180
in the universe.

50
00:03:01,180 --> 00:03:04,820
Secondly, that's intelligent life, Eric.

51
00:03:04,820 --> 00:03:08,340
What you were talking about at the beginning was simply life.

52
00:03:08,340 --> 00:03:10,100
Nice switch, by the way.

53
00:03:10,100 --> 00:03:12,400
And for that, Sagan was basically right.

54
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:17,400
You just need the right kind of star, and a planet the right distance from that star.

55
00:03:17,400 --> 00:03:22,120
Not so close that water is all boiled away, and not so far that it turns to ice.

56
00:03:22,120 --> 00:03:31,120
As of 2014, researchers have discovered precisely bubgus, nada, zilch, which is to say zero,

57
00:03:31,120 --> 00:03:33,440
followed by an infinite number of zeros.

58
00:03:33,440 --> 00:03:35,600
All right, Eric, don't over-egg the pudding.

59
00:03:35,600 --> 00:03:40,760
Look, even if we detect nada, zilch, naught point naught naught naught naught, because

60
00:03:40,760 --> 00:03:44,840
every galaxy has just one planet harbouring intelligent life.

61
00:03:44,840 --> 00:03:47,800
In other words, we're completely alone in our galaxy.

62
00:03:47,800 --> 00:03:52,440
That still means there would be over a hundred billion planets harbouring intelligent life

63
00:03:52,440 --> 00:03:57,960
in the universe as a whole, because, as I said, there are over a hundred billion galaxies.

64
00:03:57,960 --> 00:04:02,960
Eric doesn't tell us who's made these fifty criteria for life, so it's impossible to check

65
00:04:02,960 --> 00:04:03,960
it.

66
00:04:03,960 --> 00:04:08,520
But NASA, which does know a thing or two about finding life on other planets, has just three

67
00:04:08,520 --> 00:04:09,520
criteria.

68
00:04:09,520 --> 00:04:14,880
One planet must be warm and it must have water, which we now know is pretty universal.

69
00:04:14,880 --> 00:04:19,360
They've only added one thing to Sagan's criteria, it must have oxygen.

70
00:04:19,360 --> 00:04:24,560
Even PragerU admits that with these fifty unnamed criteria and an unsourced claim of

71
00:04:24,560 --> 00:04:30,720
a falling number of habitable planets, the numbers are still running in the thousands.

72
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:36,200
Thousands of habitable planets in our galaxy alone translates into hundreds of trillions

73
00:04:36,200 --> 00:04:38,080
in the universe.

74
00:04:38,080 --> 00:04:41,720
Even SETI proponents acknowledge the problem.

75
00:04:41,720 --> 00:04:47,640
Peter Schenkel wrote in a 2006 piece for Skeptical Inquirer, a magazine that strongly affirms

76
00:04:47,640 --> 00:04:48,960
atheism,

77
00:04:48,960 --> 00:04:54,360
In light of new findings and insights, we should quietly admit that the early estimates

78
00:04:54,360 --> 00:04:56,360
may no longer be tenable.

79
00:04:56,360 --> 00:04:59,480
Ah yes, the inevitable changed quote.

80
00:04:59,480 --> 00:05:03,600
So how did PragerU alter what Peter Schenkel actually wrote?

81
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:07,360
Well here's the original in Skeptical Inquirer.

82
00:05:07,360 --> 00:05:12,120
We should quietly admit that the early estimates, that there may be a million, a hundred thousand

83
00:05:12,120 --> 00:05:17,440
or ten thousand advanced extraterrestrial civilisations in our galaxy, may no longer

84
00:05:17,440 --> 00:05:18,840
be tenable.

85
00:05:18,840 --> 00:05:23,800
So what PragerU left out was that Schenkel wasn't talking about life, he was talking

86
00:05:23,800 --> 00:05:25,840
about intelligent life.

87
00:05:25,840 --> 00:05:30,600
And he wasn't referring to our universe, he was referring to our galaxy.

88
00:05:30,600 --> 00:05:35,220
And he specifically stated that the early estimates he was referring to ran into the

89
00:05:35,220 --> 00:05:37,260
hundreds of thousands.

90
00:05:37,260 --> 00:05:40,980
PragerU also chopped off the next line of Schenkel's quote,

91
00:05:40,980 --> 00:05:45,700
There might not be a hundred, not even ten, such civilisations.

92
00:05:45,700 --> 00:05:49,460
The mashed up misquote makes it appear as though Schenkel's dismissing the idea of

93
00:05:49,460 --> 00:05:54,540
life in the universe, whereas in fact he's simply reducing the estimates for intelligent

94
00:05:54,540 --> 00:06:01,380
life, not life, in our galaxy, not the universe, from hundreds of thousands to perhaps hundreds

95
00:06:01,380 --> 00:06:03,100
or just ten.

96
00:06:03,100 --> 00:06:07,700
But even that would translate to trillions of civilisations in the universe as a whole,

97
00:06:07,700 --> 00:06:12,460
and if that's the number of planets possibly harbouring intelligent life, that could mean

98
00:06:12,460 --> 00:06:17,580
a thousand times more, harbouring life at least the size of an amoeba.

99
00:06:17,580 --> 00:06:22,780
That's a huge number, and very far from the claim of impossible odds that PragerU is trying

100
00:06:22,780 --> 00:06:24,420
to conclude.

101
00:06:24,420 --> 00:06:30,140
So PragerU has completely misrepresented what Schenkel said by changing his quote and giving

102
00:06:30,140 --> 00:06:33,180
no indication that it changed his quote.

103
00:06:33,180 --> 00:06:36,020
Hang on, didn't PragerU do a course about that?

104
00:06:36,020 --> 00:06:38,500
That you live by the following nine commandments.

105
00:06:38,500 --> 00:06:42,520
And the ninth commandment says, thou shalt not deceive people by changing a quote to

106
00:06:42,520 --> 00:06:44,060
fit your conclusion.

107
00:06:44,060 --> 00:06:48,700
The odds against life in the universe are astonishing.

108
00:06:48,700 --> 00:06:53,900
Yet here we are, not only existing, but talking about existing.

109
00:06:53,900 --> 00:06:54,900
What can account for it?

110
00:06:54,900 --> 00:06:59,080
Well, I'll tell you, the best way to beat incredible odds is to have an even larger

111
00:06:59,080 --> 00:07:00,660
number of events.

112
00:07:00,660 --> 00:07:05,720
If I want to get ten heads in a row when I toss a coin, the odds against that happening

113
00:07:05,720 --> 00:07:08,340
are 1024 to one.

114
00:07:08,340 --> 00:07:12,480
So to beat those odds I have to flip the coin two thousand times.

115
00:07:12,480 --> 00:07:16,400
And if the odds against a planet harbouring life are a billion to one, then the way to

116
00:07:16,400 --> 00:07:20,400
beat those odds is to have a few billion planets.

117
00:07:20,400 --> 00:07:22,400
Problem solved.

118
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:27,420
At this point let me ask all those who wrote in, does the fact that I called Dennis Prager

119
00:07:27,420 --> 00:07:32,460
religious at the beginning of this video rather than Christian make any difference

120
00:07:32,460 --> 00:07:38,420
to the fact that PragerU miscalculated the number of habitable planets by a hundred billion?

121
00:07:38,420 --> 00:07:41,780
Or that it mixed up life with intelligent life?

122
00:07:41,780 --> 00:07:47,040
Or that it deliberately changed a quote by Peter Schenkel to support its conclusions?

123
00:07:47,040 --> 00:07:48,580
Of course not.

124
00:07:48,580 --> 00:07:52,460
But even after I corrected the error, I got indignant comments from people who thought

125
00:07:52,460 --> 00:07:55,120
I should have known that Prager was a Jew.

126
00:07:55,120 --> 00:07:57,120
What on earth is wrong with me?

127
00:07:57,120 --> 00:07:58,360
It's not exactly a secret.

128
00:07:58,360 --> 00:08:00,300
I'm a huge fan of Dennis Prager.

129
00:08:00,300 --> 00:08:01,680
It's well known he's Jewish.

130
00:08:01,680 --> 00:08:06,040
Anyone who's listened to more than an hour of his radio show would know he was a Jew.

131
00:08:06,040 --> 00:08:10,320
OK, it's also well known that Magda Subanski is a lesbian.

132
00:08:10,320 --> 00:08:13,440
And it's not exactly a secret that she has a weight problem.

133
00:08:13,440 --> 00:08:15,640
She's discussed it quite openly.

134
00:08:15,640 --> 00:08:20,560
But if you've never heard of her and didn't know any of this because you live in the USA,

135
00:08:20,560 --> 00:08:26,480
well maybe you'll understand why I'd never heard of Dennis Prager or his famous Jewishness.

136
00:08:26,520 --> 00:08:31,480
But I live in Australia, where we don't get his radio show, we don't get ads from Prager

137
00:08:31,480 --> 00:08:37,360
You on YouTube, and no one's ever heard of Dennis Prager or his university.

138
00:08:37,360 --> 00:08:41,440
I first heard about him five months ago when I was researching Patrick Moore's Prager

139
00:08:41,440 --> 00:08:43,200
You presentation.

140
00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:47,880
I might have read in passing that Dennis Prager was Jewish and that Eric Metaxas and Frank

141
00:08:47,880 --> 00:08:54,080
Pastore were Christian, and Patrick Moore is whatever he is, but it's irrelevant.

142
00:08:54,080 --> 00:08:57,200
What was more important were their scientific claims.

143
00:08:57,200 --> 00:09:02,520
And that took a huge amount of research, checking and double checking, tracking down their sources,

144
00:09:02,520 --> 00:09:08,120
discovering their miscalculations and their misquotes, and finding out how they had misrepresented

145
00:09:08,120 --> 00:09:10,120
all the scientific research.

146
00:09:10,120 --> 00:09:14,200
Now I do my best to fact check even things that aren't relevant, but every now and then

147
00:09:14,200 --> 00:09:16,760
a small error will slip by.

148
00:09:16,760 --> 00:09:20,480
And as soon as it's pointed out, I always correct it.

149
00:09:20,480 --> 00:09:23,520
So here's my challenge to Prager You fans.

150
00:09:23,520 --> 00:09:28,960
Let's now see your equally indignant posts about the numerous errors Prager You has made,

151
00:09:28,960 --> 00:09:34,680
which unlike mine, were not corrected and in one case appear to be deliberate deception.

152
00:09:34,680 --> 00:09:36,280
I look forward to reading them.

153
00:09:36,280 --> 00:09:37,280
But wait, there's more.

154
00:09:37,280 --> 00:09:38,280
Oh what now?

155
00:09:38,280 --> 00:09:43,020
The fine tuning necessary for life to exist on a planet is nothing compared with the fine

156
00:09:43,020 --> 00:09:47,060
tuning required for the universe to exist at all.

157
00:09:47,060 --> 00:09:52,240
For example, astrophysicists now know that the values of the four fundamental forces

158
00:09:52,240 --> 00:09:58,040
– gravity, the electromagnetic force, and the strong and weak nuclear forces – were

159
00:09:58,040 --> 00:10:03,080
determined less than one millionth of a second after the Big Bang.

160
00:10:03,080 --> 00:10:09,080
Alter any one of these four values ever so slightly, and the universe as we know it could

161
00:10:09,080 --> 00:10:10,360
not exist.

162
00:10:10,360 --> 00:10:14,180
And yet we know it did happen, because it does exist.

163
00:10:14,180 --> 00:10:19,160
So how did the universe overcome the incredible odds against its existence?

164
00:10:19,160 --> 00:10:22,600
Well perhaps the same way that life did.

165
00:10:22,600 --> 00:10:27,560
As we've seen, the way to beat huge odds is to have an even bigger number of events.

166
00:10:27,560 --> 00:10:32,440
In other words, have many Big Bangs and many different universes with different values

167
00:10:32,440 --> 00:10:34,660
for the fundamental forces.

168
00:10:34,660 --> 00:10:38,680
Some universes will have stars and planets, others won't.

169
00:10:38,680 --> 00:10:42,880
That may sound ridiculous, but perhaps not as ridiculous as other ideas about how our

170
00:10:42,880 --> 00:10:49,000
universe started, and at least the multiverse hypothesis has some evidence to support it.

171
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:52,400
It all starts with a very odd experiment.

172
00:10:52,400 --> 00:10:58,040
The double slit experiment sends light – that's a beam of photons – through two slits.

173
00:10:58,040 --> 00:11:00,760
It also works with a beam of electrons.

174
00:11:00,760 --> 00:11:05,040
The light forms an interference pattern on a screen on the other side, and the nature

175
00:11:05,040 --> 00:11:08,680
of that pattern suggests that light is a wave.

176
00:11:08,680 --> 00:11:14,720
But the pattern also forms in such a way that it shows light comprises particles – photons.

177
00:11:14,720 --> 00:11:19,520
The only conclusion is that light is both a wave and a particle.

178
00:11:19,520 --> 00:11:21,600
But here's the really weird part.

179
00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:27,520
The experiment works even if you send just one photon or one electron through the slits.

180
00:11:27,520 --> 00:11:31,680
The particle interference pattern suggests that the particle goes through both slits

181
00:11:31,680 --> 00:11:33,760
at the same time.

182
00:11:33,760 --> 00:11:36,580
The same thing happens with electrons.

183
00:11:36,580 --> 00:11:41,620
The only conclusion is that these particles can be in two places at the same time, and

184
00:11:41,620 --> 00:11:46,260
physicists have subsequently discovered that this extends to other particles in the quantum

185
00:11:46,260 --> 00:11:49,980
world and even properties like direction of spin.

186
00:11:49,980 --> 00:11:52,780
Wait, it gets weirder still.

187
00:11:52,780 --> 00:11:57,980
As soon as you set up a detector to track the particle, the interference pattern disappears

188
00:11:57,980 --> 00:12:01,420
and the particle only goes through one slit.

189
00:12:01,420 --> 00:12:06,780
It seems as though the act of observing the dual nature of a particle makes the effect

190
00:12:06,780 --> 00:12:08,740
disappear.

191
00:12:08,740 --> 00:12:13,420
By the way, to all the physicists out there, yes, it's much more complicated than that

192
00:12:13,420 --> 00:12:18,780
and has to do with quantum superposition and wave function and wave function collapse and

193
00:12:18,780 --> 00:12:20,900
particles being packets of energy.

194
00:12:20,900 --> 00:12:23,940
I'm just not going to get into all of that.

195
00:12:23,940 --> 00:12:28,220
Neither am I going to go into why Schrodinger devised the next experiment you're going

196
00:12:28,220 --> 00:12:31,580
to see because none of this is relevant to the video.

197
00:12:31,580 --> 00:12:36,260
I'll list further reading material in the video description if anyone is interested

198
00:12:36,260 --> 00:12:38,060
in learning the details.

199
00:12:38,060 --> 00:12:42,980
OK, so what happens when we scale that up to the world we inhabit?

200
00:12:42,980 --> 00:12:45,140
Well ordinarily it doesn't work.

201
00:12:45,140 --> 00:12:48,660
We can only observe one of the possible states.

202
00:12:48,660 --> 00:12:53,460
So maybe the other is observed in a parallel universe.

203
00:12:53,460 --> 00:12:59,340
In 1935 Erwin Schrodinger set up a thought experiment that illustrates this.

204
00:12:59,340 --> 00:13:03,780
Imagine you have a cat inside a sealed box, so you can't observe it.

205
00:13:03,780 --> 00:13:08,900
Next to it is a radioactive atom that can emit a particle through radioactive decay.

206
00:13:08,900 --> 00:13:13,620
And underneath that is a Geiger counter, hammer and a poison gas bottle.

207
00:13:13,620 --> 00:13:18,660
If a particle is emitted it will trigger the Geiger counter that releases the hammer, smashes

208
00:13:18,660 --> 00:13:21,900
the bottle and the gas then kills the cat.

209
00:13:21,900 --> 00:13:27,020
If nothing is emitted then nothing will happen and the cat will live.

210
00:13:27,020 --> 00:13:29,580
Remember you can't see inside the box.

211
00:13:29,580 --> 00:13:33,260
But you know through quantum physics that the atom is in two states.

212
00:13:33,260 --> 00:13:38,560
It's released the particle and it hasn't released the particle, which means that the cat must

213
00:13:38,560 --> 00:13:42,100
be dead and alive at the same time.

214
00:13:42,100 --> 00:13:46,180
You can't open the box and see that because as soon as you open the box the cat appears

215
00:13:46,180 --> 00:13:49,620
to you in only one state, either alive or dead.

216
00:13:49,620 --> 00:13:54,000
One explanation is that there may be a parallel universe somewhere where the cat is in the

217
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:55,540
other state.

218
00:13:55,540 --> 00:14:00,060
And if there are two universes to account for the dual state of a single particle, how

219
00:14:00,060 --> 00:14:04,940
many universes must there be to account for all the different states of all the different

220
00:14:04,940 --> 00:14:08,820
particles, an almost infinite number?

221
00:14:08,820 --> 00:14:13,820
Another more recent theory is that the quantum effect breaks down as objects get larger and

222
00:14:13,820 --> 00:14:17,000
the force of gravity becomes more significant.

223
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:21,000
But the effect on a quantum scale is no less real.

224
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:24,360
So if all this blows your mind, yes it should.

225
00:14:24,360 --> 00:14:29,240
Because the world of science, where space is curved, where time slows down when objects

226
00:14:29,240 --> 00:14:34,400
move faster and where particles can be in two places at the same time, in other words

227
00:14:34,400 --> 00:14:39,880
the world we actually live in, is far more fascinating than any mythological world of

228
00:14:39,880 --> 00:14:43,280
gods and goblins that we can invent.

229
00:14:43,280 --> 00:14:47,920
So there's no reason to believe there was only one Big Bang.

230
00:14:47,920 --> 00:14:52,360
Many physicists have suggested that Big Bangs may be happening all the time.

231
00:14:52,360 --> 00:14:56,900
We don't know of course, but we could be one of trillions of universes expanding like

232
00:14:56,900 --> 00:15:00,560
bubbles over billions of years and then dying.

233
00:15:00,560 --> 00:15:04,980
Which would mean there are thousands of universes where the values of the four forces are just

234
00:15:04,980 --> 00:15:07,680
right to form stars.

235
00:15:07,680 --> 00:15:11,880
Astrophysics and quantum physics may provide some theoretical evidence for this, but the

236
00:15:11,880 --> 00:15:15,560
plain fact is we just don't know yet.

237
00:15:15,560 --> 00:15:19,840
And making something up and being absolutely sure it's the blind, honest truth doesn't

238
00:15:19,840 --> 00:15:21,920
mean we do know.

239
00:15:21,920 --> 00:15:23,840
So what was the Big Bang?

240
00:15:23,840 --> 00:15:26,040
I mean our Big Bang.

241
00:15:26,040 --> 00:15:29,000
Fortunately PragerU has a course on this too.

242
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:34,400
Here's another videocaster, I mean university lecturer, the late Frank Pastore.

243
00:15:34,400 --> 00:15:36,840
We're all familiar with the first Big Bang, right?

244
00:15:36,840 --> 00:15:41,200
It's usually the answer given to the question, why is there something rather than nothing?

245
00:15:41,640 --> 00:15:45,960
It's the idea that there was nothing, it popped and boom, there's something.

246
00:15:45,960 --> 00:15:52,360
I mean that time, matter and space all came into existence and some great cosmological

247
00:15:52,360 --> 00:15:53,360
flash about...

248
00:15:53,360 --> 00:15:58,280
OK, the first thing I always suggest creationists do if they want to rebut science is find out

249
00:15:58,280 --> 00:16:00,920
what the science actually says.

250
00:16:00,920 --> 00:16:05,700
The idea that there was a boom that caused matter to appear out of nowhere is not the

251
00:16:05,700 --> 00:16:11,060
Big Bang theory, it's what creationists think the Big Bang theory says.

252
00:16:11,060 --> 00:16:15,820
The theory, which is actually called cosmic inflation theory, says that matter came from

253
00:16:15,820 --> 00:16:19,120
singularity, a dense point of energy.

254
00:16:19,120 --> 00:16:22,460
After all, matter and energy are interchangeable.

255
00:16:22,460 --> 00:16:24,540
Where did singularity come from?

256
00:16:24,540 --> 00:16:30,220
Oddly that's a moot question because time in our universe began with the Big Bang, which

257
00:16:30,220 --> 00:16:36,920
means that singularity was, to all intents and purposes, timeless, it was eternal.

258
00:16:36,920 --> 00:16:42,120
Some creationists argue that that's impossible and yet their entire religion is based on

259
00:16:42,120 --> 00:16:44,960
the idea of something eternal.

260
00:16:44,960 --> 00:16:51,120
Time in our universe began when singularity expanded and energy condensed into matter.

261
00:16:51,120 --> 00:16:52,500
What caused that?

262
00:16:52,500 --> 00:16:57,660
The short answer is, again, we don't know and creationists don't know either.

263
00:16:57,660 --> 00:17:03,400
They can give it a name but whatever you want to call it, call it spin-axe, Fred-leg, god

264
00:17:03,400 --> 00:17:07,920
or doodlebug, we still need to know what that thing is and how it worked.

265
00:17:07,920 --> 00:17:10,000
Did it interact with another universe?

266
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:13,180
How did expansion overcome gravitational forces?

267
00:17:13,180 --> 00:17:18,440
Is singularity a white hole, in other words a black hole in reverse, and if so how does

268
00:17:18,440 --> 00:17:24,440
a black hole reverse itself and instead of contracting space-time, expand it?

269
00:17:24,440 --> 00:17:28,840
These questions won't be answered by people in pulpits making things up, they'll be discovered

270
00:17:28,840 --> 00:17:33,380
in particle accelerators and radio telescope observatories.

271
00:17:33,380 --> 00:17:39,580
Because believe it or not, the hard part of physics isn't making up names for things.

272
00:17:39,580 --> 00:17:44,000
The best way to illustrate this is through Star Trek's transporter which measures each

273
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:50,680
particle in the transportee's body and recreates it somewhere else in exactly the same configuration.

274
00:17:50,680 --> 00:17:56,260
It was a plot device used to avoid long and messy transfers between scenes but it presented

275
00:17:56,260 --> 00:18:00,060
Star Trek's creator with a scientific problem.

276
00:18:00,060 --> 00:18:04,980
According to the Heisenberg uncertainty principle, which is part of the Copenhagen interpretation,

277
00:18:04,980 --> 00:18:09,360
you can't measure both the position of a particle and its momentum.

278
00:18:09,360 --> 00:18:14,540
The more accurately you measure one, the less accurately you can measure the other.

279
00:18:14,540 --> 00:18:18,900
So Roddenberry decided that the transporter would include a device that can overcome the

280
00:18:18,900 --> 00:18:23,660
Heisenberg uncertainty principle, called a Heisenberg compensator.

281
00:18:23,660 --> 00:18:27,340
Someone once asked Star Trek's technical advisor how it worked.

282
00:18:27,340 --> 00:18:29,940
He answered, very well, thank you.

283
00:18:29,940 --> 00:18:34,720
That's the beauty of being able to just make things up and give them names, rather

284
00:18:34,720 --> 00:18:37,300
than having to explain how they work.

285
00:18:37,300 --> 00:18:40,100
A bit like this thing they're calling God.

286
00:18:40,100 --> 00:18:44,380
All creationists have done is give the cause of cosmic inflation a name.

287
00:18:44,380 --> 00:18:45,860
How did it work?

288
00:18:45,860 --> 00:18:49,980
Well erm, very successfully, thank you.

289
00:18:49,980 --> 00:18:54,300
So yes, you can make up any story you like that the Big Bang was caused by a giant rabbit

290
00:18:54,300 --> 00:18:59,100
or a bearded man or an invisible witch, and give it any name you like.

291
00:18:59,100 --> 00:19:04,000
But one thing we do know it was not is any of the gods we've invented on Earth, because

292
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:10,000
these mythical figures allegedly performed deeds that we know never happened.

293
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:13,580
Take the Japanese gods Izanagi and Izanami for example.

294
00:19:13,580 --> 00:19:17,900
They were supposed to have created the Japanese islands, but we now know that the Japanese

295
00:19:17,900 --> 00:19:21,580
islands were formed by the collision of crustal plates.

296
00:19:21,580 --> 00:19:28,940
The Chinese god Is-Nuea supposedly made humans out of clay, but we now know that humans evolved.

297
00:19:28,940 --> 00:19:33,180
And the Jewish god, who supposedly looks like us, is believed to have flooded the Earth

298
00:19:33,180 --> 00:19:38,300
a few thousand years ago and killed all the people and animals that inhabited it.

299
00:19:38,300 --> 00:19:42,380
But we now know that no such flood ever occurred.

300
00:19:42,380 --> 00:19:46,860
If you don't get why this dismisses the notion of these gods, it's like me telling

301
00:19:46,860 --> 00:19:51,940
you that a giant dragon has burnt down the White House with its fiery breath and killed

302
00:19:51,940 --> 00:19:53,520
everyone inside.

303
00:19:53,520 --> 00:19:56,980
If you go to Washington the same day I tell you this and discover that the White House

304
00:19:56,980 --> 00:20:02,940
is still there and everyone inside is still alive, you might suspect that this dragon

305
00:20:02,940 --> 00:20:05,760
is a figment of my imagination.

306
00:20:05,760 --> 00:20:09,680
Now how many times have I said in this video, we don't know.

307
00:20:09,680 --> 00:20:11,900
We don't know what caused the Big Bang.

308
00:20:11,900 --> 00:20:15,920
We don't know why a particle can be in two places at the same time.

309
00:20:15,920 --> 00:20:18,000
We don't know a lot of things.

310
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:21,560
But conversely, there are also things we do know.

311
00:20:21,560 --> 00:20:26,360
We know that humans evolved and were not made out of clay by a Chinese goddess.

312
00:20:26,360 --> 00:20:30,860
And we know that an invisible god didn't flood the Earth a few thousand years ago because

313
00:20:30,860 --> 00:20:33,140
we know there was no such flood.

314
00:20:33,140 --> 00:20:38,480
So that's how we know that whatever force of physics caused the Big Bang, it's not going

315
00:20:38,480 --> 00:20:44,340
to be a mythical Bronze Age deity looking out for billions of years across the vast

316
00:20:44,340 --> 00:20:50,400
expanse of space, containing over a hundred billion galaxies, and then homing in on just

317
00:20:50,400 --> 00:20:56,260
one of those billions of galaxies, and then through the vast space within that galaxy

318
00:20:56,260 --> 00:21:02,460
containing hundreds of billions of stars, focusing his attention on just one star system

319
00:21:02,460 --> 00:21:09,020
and a tiny planet orbiting that very ordinary star and taking a keen interest in a chariot

320
00:21:09,020 --> 00:21:09,460
battle.

321
00:21:14,340 --> 00:21:16,340
Thank you.
