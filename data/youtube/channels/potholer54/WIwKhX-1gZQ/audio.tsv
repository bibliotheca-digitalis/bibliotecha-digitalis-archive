0	4740	The first time I uploaded this video I was hit with a wave of posts from people who pointed
4740	10160	out a minor error – that I had described the founder of PragerU as a Christian rather
10160	11760	than a Jew.
11760	18120	That makes absolutely no difference to PragerU's misrepresentation of science by its two presenters,
18120	22780	but even after I issued an immediate correction the posts still kept coming.
22780	26920	So I decided to eliminate this distraction and re-edit the video.
26920	31720	It'll be interesting to see if the complainants are now willing to show equal indignation
31720	33320	at PragerU's errors.
33320	36600	I'll discuss this in more detail later in the video.
36600	37800	Thanks for watching.
37800	44600	Perhaps the best arguments for his existence come from, of all places, science itself.
44600	45880	Scientific evidence for God.
45880	47760	Sounds convincing.
47760	53320	I first encountered Prager University, PragerU, when I did a video a few months ago debunking
53320	54520	Patrick Moore.
54520	57400	Each week PragerU offers a new course.
57400	63700	Each week we teach what isn't taught, what should be, how faith, reason and science are
63700	65400	fully compatible.
65400	70640	It's different from most universities in that it's not an accredited university.
70640	74480	It's a video channel run by a religious talk radio host.
74480	77680	It doesn't have a campus or any degrees.
77680	83080	After I watched the video Science vs God, or as PragerU put it, completed the course,
83080	85880	I didn't get a degree but I did earn a badge.
85880	87800	I'm wearing it now.
87800	91440	So what is the scientific evidence for God?
91440	95480	It turns out it's just a repeat of an old creationist's claim that the universe is finely
95480	99340	tuned and something finely tuned is impossible.
99340	103120	So something else that's finely tuned must have caused it.
103120	106480	Which of course doesn't make any sense but we'll come onto that in a minute.
106480	110660	And the other scientific evidence is that the number of planets in our galaxy harbouring
110660	114080	life is probably only a few thousand.
114080	116020	So what's the story, Eric?
116020	117460	Here's the story.
117460	122500	The same year Time featured its now famous headline, the astronomer Carl Sagan announced
122500	127440	that there were two necessary criteria for a planet to support life – the right kind
127440	131700	of star and a planet the right distance from that star.
131700	137180	Given the roughly octillion planets in the universe – that's one followed by 24 zeros
137980	142020	– there should have been about septillion planets – that's one followed by 21 zeros
142020	144900	– capable of supporting life.
144900	150660	With such spectacular odds, scientists were optimistic that the search for extraterrestrial
150660	156700	intelligence known by its initials S.E.T.I., an ambitious project launched in the 1960s,
156700	159180	was sure to turn up something soon.
159180	164540	With a vast radio telescopic network, scientists listened for signals that resembled coded
164540	165540	intelligence.
165540	169620	As the years passed, the silence from the universe was deafening.
169620	171380	OK, couple of things here.
171380	174820	Firstly, S.E.T.I. wasn't listening in on the whole universe.
174820	180180	It was listening in on only a fraction of one galaxy out of a hundred billion galaxies
180180	181180	in the universe.
181180	184820	Secondly, that's intelligent life, Eric.
184820	188340	What you were talking about at the beginning was simply life.
188340	190100	Nice switch, by the way.
190100	192400	And for that, Sagan was basically right.
192400	197400	You just need the right kind of star, and a planet the right distance from that star.
197400	202120	Not so close that water is all boiled away, and not so far that it turns to ice.
202120	211120	As of 2014, researchers have discovered precisely bubgus, nada, zilch, which is to say zero,
211120	213440	followed by an infinite number of zeros.
213440	215600	All right, Eric, don't over-egg the pudding.
215600	220760	Look, even if we detect nada, zilch, naught point naught naught naught naught, because
220760	224840	every galaxy has just one planet harbouring intelligent life.
224840	227800	In other words, we're completely alone in our galaxy.
227800	232440	That still means there would be over a hundred billion planets harbouring intelligent life
232440	237960	in the universe as a whole, because, as I said, there are over a hundred billion galaxies.
237960	242960	Eric doesn't tell us who's made these fifty criteria for life, so it's impossible to check
242960	243960	it.
243960	248520	But NASA, which does know a thing or two about finding life on other planets, has just three
248520	249520	criteria.
249520	254880	One planet must be warm and it must have water, which we now know is pretty universal.
254880	259360	They've only added one thing to Sagan's criteria, it must have oxygen.
259360	264560	Even PragerU admits that with these fifty unnamed criteria and an unsourced claim of
264560	270720	a falling number of habitable planets, the numbers are still running in the thousands.
270720	276200	Thousands of habitable planets in our galaxy alone translates into hundreds of trillions
276200	278080	in the universe.
278080	281720	Even SETI proponents acknowledge the problem.
281720	287640	Peter Schenkel wrote in a 2006 piece for Skeptical Inquirer, a magazine that strongly affirms
287640	288960	atheism,
288960	294360	In light of new findings and insights, we should quietly admit that the early estimates
294360	296360	may no longer be tenable.
296360	299480	Ah yes, the inevitable changed quote.
299480	303600	So how did PragerU alter what Peter Schenkel actually wrote?
303600	307360	Well here's the original in Skeptical Inquirer.
307360	312120	We should quietly admit that the early estimates, that there may be a million, a hundred thousand
312120	317440	or ten thousand advanced extraterrestrial civilisations in our galaxy, may no longer
317440	318840	be tenable.
318840	323800	So what PragerU left out was that Schenkel wasn't talking about life, he was talking
323800	325840	about intelligent life.
325840	330600	And he wasn't referring to our universe, he was referring to our galaxy.
330600	335220	And he specifically stated that the early estimates he was referring to ran into the
335220	337260	hundreds of thousands.
337260	340980	PragerU also chopped off the next line of Schenkel's quote,
340980	345700	There might not be a hundred, not even ten, such civilisations.
345700	349460	The mashed up misquote makes it appear as though Schenkel's dismissing the idea of
349460	354540	life in the universe, whereas in fact he's simply reducing the estimates for intelligent
354540	361380	life, not life, in our galaxy, not the universe, from hundreds of thousands to perhaps hundreds
361380	363100	or just ten.
363100	367700	But even that would translate to trillions of civilisations in the universe as a whole,
367700	372460	and if that's the number of planets possibly harbouring intelligent life, that could mean
372460	377580	a thousand times more, harbouring life at least the size of an amoeba.
377580	382780	That's a huge number, and very far from the claim of impossible odds that PragerU is trying
382780	384420	to conclude.
384420	390140	So PragerU has completely misrepresented what Schenkel said by changing his quote and giving
390140	393180	no indication that it changed his quote.
393180	396020	Hang on, didn't PragerU do a course about that?
396020	398500	That you live by the following nine commandments.
398500	402520	And the ninth commandment says, thou shalt not deceive people by changing a quote to
402520	404060	fit your conclusion.
404060	408700	The odds against life in the universe are astonishing.
408700	413900	Yet here we are, not only existing, but talking about existing.
413900	414900	What can account for it?
414900	419080	Well, I'll tell you, the best way to beat incredible odds is to have an even larger
419080	420660	number of events.
420660	425720	If I want to get ten heads in a row when I toss a coin, the odds against that happening
425720	428340	are 1024 to one.
428340	432480	So to beat those odds I have to flip the coin two thousand times.
432480	436400	And if the odds against a planet harbouring life are a billion to one, then the way to
436400	440400	beat those odds is to have a few billion planets.
440400	442400	Problem solved.
442400	447420	At this point let me ask all those who wrote in, does the fact that I called Dennis Prager
447420	452460	religious at the beginning of this video rather than Christian make any difference
452460	458420	to the fact that PragerU miscalculated the number of habitable planets by a hundred billion?
458420	461780	Or that it mixed up life with intelligent life?
461780	467040	Or that it deliberately changed a quote by Peter Schenkel to support its conclusions?
467040	468580	Of course not.
468580	472460	But even after I corrected the error, I got indignant comments from people who thought
472460	475120	I should have known that Prager was a Jew.
475120	477120	What on earth is wrong with me?
477120	478360	It's not exactly a secret.
478360	480300	I'm a huge fan of Dennis Prager.
480300	481680	It's well known he's Jewish.
481680	486040	Anyone who's listened to more than an hour of his radio show would know he was a Jew.
486040	490320	OK, it's also well known that Magda Subanski is a lesbian.
490320	493440	And it's not exactly a secret that she has a weight problem.
493440	495640	She's discussed it quite openly.
495640	500560	But if you've never heard of her and didn't know any of this because you live in the USA,
500560	506480	well maybe you'll understand why I'd never heard of Dennis Prager or his famous Jewishness.
506520	511480	But I live in Australia, where we don't get his radio show, we don't get ads from Prager
511480	517360	You on YouTube, and no one's ever heard of Dennis Prager or his university.
517360	521440	I first heard about him five months ago when I was researching Patrick Moore's Prager
521440	523200	You presentation.
523200	527880	I might have read in passing that Dennis Prager was Jewish and that Eric Metaxas and Frank
527880	534080	Pastore were Christian, and Patrick Moore is whatever he is, but it's irrelevant.
534080	537200	What was more important were their scientific claims.
537200	542520	And that took a huge amount of research, checking and double checking, tracking down their sources,
542520	548120	discovering their miscalculations and their misquotes, and finding out how they had misrepresented
548120	550120	all the scientific research.
550120	554200	Now I do my best to fact check even things that aren't relevant, but every now and then
554200	556760	a small error will slip by.
556760	560480	And as soon as it's pointed out, I always correct it.
560480	563520	So here's my challenge to Prager You fans.
563520	568960	Let's now see your equally indignant posts about the numerous errors Prager You has made,
568960	574680	which unlike mine, were not corrected and in one case appear to be deliberate deception.
574680	576280	I look forward to reading them.
576280	577280	But wait, there's more.
577280	578280	Oh what now?
578280	583020	The fine tuning necessary for life to exist on a planet is nothing compared with the fine
583020	587060	tuning required for the universe to exist at all.
587060	592240	For example, astrophysicists now know that the values of the four fundamental forces
592240	598040	– gravity, the electromagnetic force, and the strong and weak nuclear forces – were
598040	603080	determined less than one millionth of a second after the Big Bang.
603080	609080	Alter any one of these four values ever so slightly, and the universe as we know it could
609080	610360	not exist.
610360	614180	And yet we know it did happen, because it does exist.
614180	619160	So how did the universe overcome the incredible odds against its existence?
619160	622600	Well perhaps the same way that life did.
622600	627560	As we've seen, the way to beat huge odds is to have an even bigger number of events.
627560	632440	In other words, have many Big Bangs and many different universes with different values
632440	634660	for the fundamental forces.
634660	638680	Some universes will have stars and planets, others won't.
638680	642880	That may sound ridiculous, but perhaps not as ridiculous as other ideas about how our
642880	649000	universe started, and at least the multiverse hypothesis has some evidence to support it.
649000	652400	It all starts with a very odd experiment.
652400	658040	The double slit experiment sends light – that's a beam of photons – through two slits.
658040	660760	It also works with a beam of electrons.
660760	665040	The light forms an interference pattern on a screen on the other side, and the nature
665040	668680	of that pattern suggests that light is a wave.
668680	674720	But the pattern also forms in such a way that it shows light comprises particles – photons.
674720	679520	The only conclusion is that light is both a wave and a particle.
679520	681600	But here's the really weird part.
681600	687520	The experiment works even if you send just one photon or one electron through the slits.
687520	691680	The particle interference pattern suggests that the particle goes through both slits
691680	693760	at the same time.
693760	696580	The same thing happens with electrons.
696580	701620	The only conclusion is that these particles can be in two places at the same time, and
701620	706260	physicists have subsequently discovered that this extends to other particles in the quantum
706260	709980	world and even properties like direction of spin.
709980	712780	Wait, it gets weirder still.
712780	717980	As soon as you set up a detector to track the particle, the interference pattern disappears
717980	721420	and the particle only goes through one slit.
721420	726780	It seems as though the act of observing the dual nature of a particle makes the effect
726780	728740	disappear.
728740	733420	By the way, to all the physicists out there, yes, it's much more complicated than that
733420	738780	and has to do with quantum superposition and wave function and wave function collapse and
738780	740900	particles being packets of energy.
740900	743940	I'm just not going to get into all of that.
743940	748220	Neither am I going to go into why Schrodinger devised the next experiment you're going
748220	751580	to see because none of this is relevant to the video.
751580	756260	I'll list further reading material in the video description if anyone is interested
756260	758060	in learning the details.
758060	762980	OK, so what happens when we scale that up to the world we inhabit?
762980	765140	Well ordinarily it doesn't work.
765140	768660	We can only observe one of the possible states.
768660	773460	So maybe the other is observed in a parallel universe.
773460	779340	In 1935 Erwin Schrodinger set up a thought experiment that illustrates this.
779340	783780	Imagine you have a cat inside a sealed box, so you can't observe it.
783780	788900	Next to it is a radioactive atom that can emit a particle through radioactive decay.
788900	793620	And underneath that is a Geiger counter, hammer and a poison gas bottle.
793620	798660	If a particle is emitted it will trigger the Geiger counter that releases the hammer, smashes
798660	801900	the bottle and the gas then kills the cat.
801900	807020	If nothing is emitted then nothing will happen and the cat will live.
807020	809580	Remember you can't see inside the box.
809580	813260	But you know through quantum physics that the atom is in two states.
813260	818560	It's released the particle and it hasn't released the particle, which means that the cat must
818560	822100	be dead and alive at the same time.
822100	826180	You can't open the box and see that because as soon as you open the box the cat appears
826180	829620	to you in only one state, either alive or dead.
829620	834000	One explanation is that there may be a parallel universe somewhere where the cat is in the
834000	835540	other state.
835540	840060	And if there are two universes to account for the dual state of a single particle, how
840060	844940	many universes must there be to account for all the different states of all the different
844940	848820	particles, an almost infinite number?
848820	853820	Another more recent theory is that the quantum effect breaks down as objects get larger and
853820	857000	the force of gravity becomes more significant.
857000	861000	But the effect on a quantum scale is no less real.
861000	864360	So if all this blows your mind, yes it should.
864360	869240	Because the world of science, where space is curved, where time slows down when objects
869240	874400	move faster and where particles can be in two places at the same time, in other words
874400	879880	the world we actually live in, is far more fascinating than any mythological world of
879880	883280	gods and goblins that we can invent.
883280	887920	So there's no reason to believe there was only one Big Bang.
887920	892360	Many physicists have suggested that Big Bangs may be happening all the time.
892360	896900	We don't know of course, but we could be one of trillions of universes expanding like
896900	900560	bubbles over billions of years and then dying.
900560	904980	Which would mean there are thousands of universes where the values of the four forces are just
904980	907680	right to form stars.
907680	911880	Astrophysics and quantum physics may provide some theoretical evidence for this, but the
911880	915560	plain fact is we just don't know yet.
915560	919840	And making something up and being absolutely sure it's the blind, honest truth doesn't
919840	921920	mean we do know.
921920	923840	So what was the Big Bang?
923840	926040	I mean our Big Bang.
926040	929000	Fortunately PragerU has a course on this too.
929000	934400	Here's another videocaster, I mean university lecturer, the late Frank Pastore.
934400	936840	We're all familiar with the first Big Bang, right?
936840	941200	It's usually the answer given to the question, why is there something rather than nothing?
941640	945960	It's the idea that there was nothing, it popped and boom, there's something.
945960	952360	I mean that time, matter and space all came into existence and some great cosmological
952360	953360	flash about...
953360	958280	OK, the first thing I always suggest creationists do if they want to rebut science is find out
958280	960920	what the science actually says.
960920	965700	The idea that there was a boom that caused matter to appear out of nowhere is not the
965700	971060	Big Bang theory, it's what creationists think the Big Bang theory says.
971060	975820	The theory, which is actually called cosmic inflation theory, says that matter came from
975820	979120	singularity, a dense point of energy.
979120	982460	After all, matter and energy are interchangeable.
982460	984540	Where did singularity come from?
984540	990220	Oddly that's a moot question because time in our universe began with the Big Bang, which
990220	996920	means that singularity was, to all intents and purposes, timeless, it was eternal.
996920	1002120	Some creationists argue that that's impossible and yet their entire religion is based on
1002120	1004960	the idea of something eternal.
1004960	1011120	Time in our universe began when singularity expanded and energy condensed into matter.
1011120	1012500	What caused that?
1012500	1017660	The short answer is, again, we don't know and creationists don't know either.
1017660	1023400	They can give it a name but whatever you want to call it, call it spin-axe, Fred-leg, god
1023400	1027920	or doodlebug, we still need to know what that thing is and how it worked.
1027920	1030000	Did it interact with another universe?
1030000	1033180	How did expansion overcome gravitational forces?
1033180	1038440	Is singularity a white hole, in other words a black hole in reverse, and if so how does
1038440	1044440	a black hole reverse itself and instead of contracting space-time, expand it?
1044440	1048840	These questions won't be answered by people in pulpits making things up, they'll be discovered
1048840	1053380	in particle accelerators and radio telescope observatories.
1053380	1059580	Because believe it or not, the hard part of physics isn't making up names for things.
1059580	1064000	The best way to illustrate this is through Star Trek's transporter which measures each
1064000	1070680	particle in the transportee's body and recreates it somewhere else in exactly the same configuration.
1070680	1076260	It was a plot device used to avoid long and messy transfers between scenes but it presented
1076260	1080060	Star Trek's creator with a scientific problem.
1080060	1084980	According to the Heisenberg uncertainty principle, which is part of the Copenhagen interpretation,
1084980	1089360	you can't measure both the position of a particle and its momentum.
1089360	1094540	The more accurately you measure one, the less accurately you can measure the other.
1094540	1098900	So Roddenberry decided that the transporter would include a device that can overcome the
1098900	1103660	Heisenberg uncertainty principle, called a Heisenberg compensator.
1103660	1107340	Someone once asked Star Trek's technical advisor how it worked.
1107340	1109940	He answered, very well, thank you.
1109940	1114720	That's the beauty of being able to just make things up and give them names, rather
1114720	1117300	than having to explain how they work.
1117300	1120100	A bit like this thing they're calling God.
1120100	1124380	All creationists have done is give the cause of cosmic inflation a name.
1124380	1125860	How did it work?
1125860	1129980	Well erm, very successfully, thank you.
1129980	1134300	So yes, you can make up any story you like that the Big Bang was caused by a giant rabbit
1134300	1139100	or a bearded man or an invisible witch, and give it any name you like.
1139100	1144000	But one thing we do know it was not is any of the gods we've invented on Earth, because
1144000	1150000	these mythical figures allegedly performed deeds that we know never happened.
1150000	1153580	Take the Japanese gods Izanagi and Izanami for example.
1153580	1157900	They were supposed to have created the Japanese islands, but we now know that the Japanese
1157900	1161580	islands were formed by the collision of crustal plates.
1161580	1168940	The Chinese god Is-Nuea supposedly made humans out of clay, but we now know that humans evolved.
1168940	1173180	And the Jewish god, who supposedly looks like us, is believed to have flooded the Earth
1173180	1178300	a few thousand years ago and killed all the people and animals that inhabited it.
1178300	1182380	But we now know that no such flood ever occurred.
1182380	1186860	If you don't get why this dismisses the notion of these gods, it's like me telling
1186860	1191940	you that a giant dragon has burnt down the White House with its fiery breath and killed
1191940	1193520	everyone inside.
1193520	1196980	If you go to Washington the same day I tell you this and discover that the White House
1196980	1202940	is still there and everyone inside is still alive, you might suspect that this dragon
1202940	1205760	is a figment of my imagination.
1205760	1209680	Now how many times have I said in this video, we don't know.
1209680	1211900	We don't know what caused the Big Bang.
1211900	1215920	We don't know why a particle can be in two places at the same time.
1215920	1218000	We don't know a lot of things.
1218000	1221560	But conversely, there are also things we do know.
1221560	1226360	We know that humans evolved and were not made out of clay by a Chinese goddess.
1226360	1230860	And we know that an invisible god didn't flood the Earth a few thousand years ago because
1230860	1233140	we know there was no such flood.
1233140	1238480	So that's how we know that whatever force of physics caused the Big Bang, it's not going
1238480	1244340	to be a mythical Bronze Age deity looking out for billions of years across the vast
1244340	1250400	expanse of space, containing over a hundred billion galaxies, and then homing in on just
1250400	1256260	one of those billions of galaxies, and then through the vast space within that galaxy
1256260	1262460	containing hundreds of billions of stars, focusing his attention on just one star system
1262460	1269020	and a tiny planet orbiting that very ordinary star and taking a keen interest in a chariot
1269020	1269460	battle.
1274340	1276340	Thank you.
