WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:04.740
The first time I uploaded this video I was hit with a wave of posts from people who pointed

00:04.740 --> 00:10.160
out a minor error – that I had described the founder of PragerU as a Christian rather

00:10.160 --> 00:11.760
than a Jew.

00:11.760 --> 00:18.120
That makes absolutely no difference to PragerU's misrepresentation of science by its two presenters,

00:18.120 --> 00:22.780
but even after I issued an immediate correction the posts still kept coming.

00:22.780 --> 00:26.920
So I decided to eliminate this distraction and re-edit the video.

00:26.920 --> 00:31.720
It'll be interesting to see if the complainants are now willing to show equal indignation

00:31.720 --> 00:33.320
at PragerU's errors.

00:33.320 --> 00:36.600
I'll discuss this in more detail later in the video.

00:36.600 --> 00:37.800
Thanks for watching.

00:37.800 --> 00:44.600
Perhaps the best arguments for his existence come from, of all places, science itself.

00:44.600 --> 00:45.880
Scientific evidence for God.

00:45.880 --> 00:47.760
Sounds convincing.

00:47.760 --> 00:53.320
I first encountered Prager University, PragerU, when I did a video a few months ago debunking

00:53.320 --> 00:54.520
Patrick Moore.

00:54.520 --> 00:57.400
Each week PragerU offers a new course.

00:57.400 --> 01:03.700
Each week we teach what isn't taught, what should be, how faith, reason and science are

01:03.700 --> 01:05.400
fully compatible.

01:05.400 --> 01:10.640
It's different from most universities in that it's not an accredited university.

01:10.640 --> 01:14.480
It's a video channel run by a religious talk radio host.

01:14.480 --> 01:17.680
It doesn't have a campus or any degrees.

01:17.680 --> 01:23.080
After I watched the video Science vs God, or as PragerU put it, completed the course,

01:23.080 --> 01:25.880
I didn't get a degree but I did earn a badge.

01:25.880 --> 01:27.800
I'm wearing it now.

01:27.800 --> 01:31.440
So what is the scientific evidence for God?

01:31.440 --> 01:35.480
It turns out it's just a repeat of an old creationist's claim that the universe is finely

01:35.480 --> 01:39.340
tuned and something finely tuned is impossible.

01:39.340 --> 01:43.120
So something else that's finely tuned must have caused it.

01:43.120 --> 01:46.480
Which of course doesn't make any sense but we'll come onto that in a minute.

01:46.480 --> 01:50.660
And the other scientific evidence is that the number of planets in our galaxy harbouring

01:50.660 --> 01:54.080
life is probably only a few thousand.

01:54.080 --> 01:56.020
So what's the story, Eric?

01:56.020 --> 01:57.460
Here's the story.

01:57.460 --> 02:02.500
The same year Time featured its now famous headline, the astronomer Carl Sagan announced

02:02.500 --> 02:07.440
that there were two necessary criteria for a planet to support life – the right kind

02:07.440 --> 02:11.700
of star and a planet the right distance from that star.

02:11.700 --> 02:17.180
Given the roughly octillion planets in the universe – that's one followed by 24 zeros

02:17.980 --> 02:22.020
– there should have been about septillion planets – that's one followed by 21 zeros

02:22.020 --> 02:24.900
– capable of supporting life.

02:24.900 --> 02:30.660
With such spectacular odds, scientists were optimistic that the search for extraterrestrial

02:30.660 --> 02:36.700
intelligence known by its initials S.E.T.I., an ambitious project launched in the 1960s,

02:36.700 --> 02:39.180
was sure to turn up something soon.

02:39.180 --> 02:44.540
With a vast radio telescopic network, scientists listened for signals that resembled coded

02:44.540 --> 02:45.540
intelligence.

02:45.540 --> 02:49.620
As the years passed, the silence from the universe was deafening.

02:49.620 --> 02:51.380
OK, couple of things here.

02:51.380 --> 02:54.820
Firstly, S.E.T.I. wasn't listening in on the whole universe.

02:54.820 --> 03:00.180
It was listening in on only a fraction of one galaxy out of a hundred billion galaxies

03:00.180 --> 03:01.180
in the universe.

03:01.180 --> 03:04.820
Secondly, that's intelligent life, Eric.

03:04.820 --> 03:08.340
What you were talking about at the beginning was simply life.

03:08.340 --> 03:10.100
Nice switch, by the way.

03:10.100 --> 03:12.400
And for that, Sagan was basically right.

03:12.400 --> 03:17.400
You just need the right kind of star, and a planet the right distance from that star.

03:17.400 --> 03:22.120
Not so close that water is all boiled away, and not so far that it turns to ice.

03:22.120 --> 03:31.120
As of 2014, researchers have discovered precisely bubgus, nada, zilch, which is to say zero,

03:31.120 --> 03:33.440
followed by an infinite number of zeros.

03:33.440 --> 03:35.600
All right, Eric, don't over-egg the pudding.

03:35.600 --> 03:40.760
Look, even if we detect nada, zilch, naught point naught naught naught naught, because

03:40.760 --> 03:44.840
every galaxy has just one planet harbouring intelligent life.

03:44.840 --> 03:47.800
In other words, we're completely alone in our galaxy.

03:47.800 --> 03:52.440
That still means there would be over a hundred billion planets harbouring intelligent life

03:52.440 --> 03:57.960
in the universe as a whole, because, as I said, there are over a hundred billion galaxies.

03:57.960 --> 04:02.960
Eric doesn't tell us who's made these fifty criteria for life, so it's impossible to check

04:02.960 --> 04:03.960
it.

04:03.960 --> 04:08.520
But NASA, which does know a thing or two about finding life on other planets, has just three

04:08.520 --> 04:09.520
criteria.

04:09.520 --> 04:14.880
One planet must be warm and it must have water, which we now know is pretty universal.

04:14.880 --> 04:19.360
They've only added one thing to Sagan's criteria, it must have oxygen.

04:19.360 --> 04:24.560
Even PragerU admits that with these fifty unnamed criteria and an unsourced claim of

04:24.560 --> 04:30.720
a falling number of habitable planets, the numbers are still running in the thousands.

04:30.720 --> 04:36.200
Thousands of habitable planets in our galaxy alone translates into hundreds of trillions

04:36.200 --> 04:38.080
in the universe.

04:38.080 --> 04:41.720
Even SETI proponents acknowledge the problem.

04:41.720 --> 04:47.640
Peter Schenkel wrote in a 2006 piece for Skeptical Inquirer, a magazine that strongly affirms

04:47.640 --> 04:48.960
atheism,

04:48.960 --> 04:54.360
In light of new findings and insights, we should quietly admit that the early estimates

04:54.360 --> 04:56.360
may no longer be tenable.

04:56.360 --> 04:59.480
Ah yes, the inevitable changed quote.

04:59.480 --> 05:03.600
So how did PragerU alter what Peter Schenkel actually wrote?

05:03.600 --> 05:07.360
Well here's the original in Skeptical Inquirer.

05:07.360 --> 05:12.120
We should quietly admit that the early estimates, that there may be a million, a hundred thousand

05:12.120 --> 05:17.440
or ten thousand advanced extraterrestrial civilisations in our galaxy, may no longer

05:17.440 --> 05:18.840
be tenable.

05:18.840 --> 05:23.800
So what PragerU left out was that Schenkel wasn't talking about life, he was talking

05:23.800 --> 05:25.840
about intelligent life.

05:25.840 --> 05:30.600
And he wasn't referring to our universe, he was referring to our galaxy.

05:30.600 --> 05:35.220
And he specifically stated that the early estimates he was referring to ran into the

05:35.220 --> 05:37.260
hundreds of thousands.

05:37.260 --> 05:40.980
PragerU also chopped off the next line of Schenkel's quote,

05:40.980 --> 05:45.700
There might not be a hundred, not even ten, such civilisations.

05:45.700 --> 05:49.460
The mashed up misquote makes it appear as though Schenkel's dismissing the idea of

05:49.460 --> 05:54.540
life in the universe, whereas in fact he's simply reducing the estimates for intelligent

05:54.540 --> 06:01.380
life, not life, in our galaxy, not the universe, from hundreds of thousands to perhaps hundreds

06:01.380 --> 06:03.100
or just ten.

06:03.100 --> 06:07.700
But even that would translate to trillions of civilisations in the universe as a whole,

06:07.700 --> 06:12.460
and if that's the number of planets possibly harbouring intelligent life, that could mean

06:12.460 --> 06:17.580
a thousand times more, harbouring life at least the size of an amoeba.

06:17.580 --> 06:22.780
That's a huge number, and very far from the claim of impossible odds that PragerU is trying

06:22.780 --> 06:24.420
to conclude.

06:24.420 --> 06:30.140
So PragerU has completely misrepresented what Schenkel said by changing his quote and giving

06:30.140 --> 06:33.180
no indication that it changed his quote.

06:33.180 --> 06:36.020
Hang on, didn't PragerU do a course about that?

06:36.020 --> 06:38.500
That you live by the following nine commandments.

06:38.500 --> 06:42.520
And the ninth commandment says, thou shalt not deceive people by changing a quote to

06:42.520 --> 06:44.060
fit your conclusion.

06:44.060 --> 06:48.700
The odds against life in the universe are astonishing.

06:48.700 --> 06:53.900
Yet here we are, not only existing, but talking about existing.

06:53.900 --> 06:54.900
What can account for it?

06:54.900 --> 06:59.080
Well, I'll tell you, the best way to beat incredible odds is to have an even larger

06:59.080 --> 07:00.660
number of events.

07:00.660 --> 07:05.720
If I want to get ten heads in a row when I toss a coin, the odds against that happening

07:05.720 --> 07:08.340
are 1024 to one.

07:08.340 --> 07:12.480
So to beat those odds I have to flip the coin two thousand times.

07:12.480 --> 07:16.400
And if the odds against a planet harbouring life are a billion to one, then the way to

07:16.400 --> 07:20.400
beat those odds is to have a few billion planets.

07:20.400 --> 07:22.400
Problem solved.

07:22.400 --> 07:27.420
At this point let me ask all those who wrote in, does the fact that I called Dennis Prager

07:27.420 --> 07:32.460
religious at the beginning of this video rather than Christian make any difference

07:32.460 --> 07:38.420
to the fact that PragerU miscalculated the number of habitable planets by a hundred billion?

07:38.420 --> 07:41.780
Or that it mixed up life with intelligent life?

07:41.780 --> 07:47.040
Or that it deliberately changed a quote by Peter Schenkel to support its conclusions?

07:47.040 --> 07:48.580
Of course not.

07:48.580 --> 07:52.460
But even after I corrected the error, I got indignant comments from people who thought

07:52.460 --> 07:55.120
I should have known that Prager was a Jew.

07:55.120 --> 07:57.120
What on earth is wrong with me?

07:57.120 --> 07:58.360
It's not exactly a secret.

07:58.360 --> 08:00.300
I'm a huge fan of Dennis Prager.

08:00.300 --> 08:01.680
It's well known he's Jewish.

08:01.680 --> 08:06.040
Anyone who's listened to more than an hour of his radio show would know he was a Jew.

08:06.040 --> 08:10.320
OK, it's also well known that Magda Subanski is a lesbian.

08:10.320 --> 08:13.440
And it's not exactly a secret that she has a weight problem.

08:13.440 --> 08:15.640
She's discussed it quite openly.

08:15.640 --> 08:20.560
But if you've never heard of her and didn't know any of this because you live in the USA,

08:20.560 --> 08:26.480
well maybe you'll understand why I'd never heard of Dennis Prager or his famous Jewishness.

08:26.520 --> 08:31.480
But I live in Australia, where we don't get his radio show, we don't get ads from Prager

08:31.480 --> 08:37.360
You on YouTube, and no one's ever heard of Dennis Prager or his university.

08:37.360 --> 08:41.440
I first heard about him five months ago when I was researching Patrick Moore's Prager

08:41.440 --> 08:43.200
You presentation.

08:43.200 --> 08:47.880
I might have read in passing that Dennis Prager was Jewish and that Eric Metaxas and Frank

08:47.880 --> 08:54.080
Pastore were Christian, and Patrick Moore is whatever he is, but it's irrelevant.

08:54.080 --> 08:57.200
What was more important were their scientific claims.

08:57.200 --> 09:02.520
And that took a huge amount of research, checking and double checking, tracking down their sources,

09:02.520 --> 09:08.120
discovering their miscalculations and their misquotes, and finding out how they had misrepresented

09:08.120 --> 09:10.120
all the scientific research.

09:10.120 --> 09:14.200
Now I do my best to fact check even things that aren't relevant, but every now and then

09:14.200 --> 09:16.760
a small error will slip by.

09:16.760 --> 09:20.480
And as soon as it's pointed out, I always correct it.

09:20.480 --> 09:23.520
So here's my challenge to Prager You fans.

09:23.520 --> 09:28.960
Let's now see your equally indignant posts about the numerous errors Prager You has made,

09:28.960 --> 09:34.680
which unlike mine, were not corrected and in one case appear to be deliberate deception.

09:34.680 --> 09:36.280
I look forward to reading them.

09:36.280 --> 09:37.280
But wait, there's more.

09:37.280 --> 09:38.280
Oh what now?

09:38.280 --> 09:43.020
The fine tuning necessary for life to exist on a planet is nothing compared with the fine

09:43.020 --> 09:47.060
tuning required for the universe to exist at all.

09:47.060 --> 09:52.240
For example, astrophysicists now know that the values of the four fundamental forces

09:52.240 --> 09:58.040
– gravity, the electromagnetic force, and the strong and weak nuclear forces – were

09:58.040 --> 10:03.080
determined less than one millionth of a second after the Big Bang.

10:03.080 --> 10:09.080
Alter any one of these four values ever so slightly, and the universe as we know it could

10:09.080 --> 10:10.360
not exist.

10:10.360 --> 10:14.180
And yet we know it did happen, because it does exist.

10:14.180 --> 10:19.160
So how did the universe overcome the incredible odds against its existence?

10:19.160 --> 10:22.600
Well perhaps the same way that life did.

10:22.600 --> 10:27.560
As we've seen, the way to beat huge odds is to have an even bigger number of events.

10:27.560 --> 10:32.440
In other words, have many Big Bangs and many different universes with different values

10:32.440 --> 10:34.660
for the fundamental forces.

10:34.660 --> 10:38.680
Some universes will have stars and planets, others won't.

10:38.680 --> 10:42.880
That may sound ridiculous, but perhaps not as ridiculous as other ideas about how our

10:42.880 --> 10:49.000
universe started, and at least the multiverse hypothesis has some evidence to support it.

10:49.000 --> 10:52.400
It all starts with a very odd experiment.

10:52.400 --> 10:58.040
The double slit experiment sends light – that's a beam of photons – through two slits.

10:58.040 --> 11:00.760
It also works with a beam of electrons.

11:00.760 --> 11:05.040
The light forms an interference pattern on a screen on the other side, and the nature

11:05.040 --> 11:08.680
of that pattern suggests that light is a wave.

11:08.680 --> 11:14.720
But the pattern also forms in such a way that it shows light comprises particles – photons.

11:14.720 --> 11:19.520
The only conclusion is that light is both a wave and a particle.

11:19.520 --> 11:21.600
But here's the really weird part.

11:21.600 --> 11:27.520
The experiment works even if you send just one photon or one electron through the slits.

11:27.520 --> 11:31.680
The particle interference pattern suggests that the particle goes through both slits

11:31.680 --> 11:33.760
at the same time.

11:33.760 --> 11:36.580
The same thing happens with electrons.

11:36.580 --> 11:41.620
The only conclusion is that these particles can be in two places at the same time, and

11:41.620 --> 11:46.260
physicists have subsequently discovered that this extends to other particles in the quantum

11:46.260 --> 11:49.980
world and even properties like direction of spin.

11:49.980 --> 11:52.780
Wait, it gets weirder still.

11:52.780 --> 11:57.980
As soon as you set up a detector to track the particle, the interference pattern disappears

11:57.980 --> 12:01.420
and the particle only goes through one slit.

12:01.420 --> 12:06.780
It seems as though the act of observing the dual nature of a particle makes the effect

12:06.780 --> 12:08.740
disappear.

12:08.740 --> 12:13.420
By the way, to all the physicists out there, yes, it's much more complicated than that

12:13.420 --> 12:18.780
and has to do with quantum superposition and wave function and wave function collapse and

12:18.780 --> 12:20.900
particles being packets of energy.

12:20.900 --> 12:23.940
I'm just not going to get into all of that.

12:23.940 --> 12:28.220
Neither am I going to go into why Schrodinger devised the next experiment you're going

12:28.220 --> 12:31.580
to see because none of this is relevant to the video.

12:31.580 --> 12:36.260
I'll list further reading material in the video description if anyone is interested

12:36.260 --> 12:38.060
in learning the details.

12:38.060 --> 12:42.980
OK, so what happens when we scale that up to the world we inhabit?

12:42.980 --> 12:45.140
Well ordinarily it doesn't work.

12:45.140 --> 12:48.660
We can only observe one of the possible states.

12:48.660 --> 12:53.460
So maybe the other is observed in a parallel universe.

12:53.460 --> 12:59.340
In 1935 Erwin Schrodinger set up a thought experiment that illustrates this.

12:59.340 --> 13:03.780
Imagine you have a cat inside a sealed box, so you can't observe it.

13:03.780 --> 13:08.900
Next to it is a radioactive atom that can emit a particle through radioactive decay.

13:08.900 --> 13:13.620
And underneath that is a Geiger counter, hammer and a poison gas bottle.

13:13.620 --> 13:18.660
If a particle is emitted it will trigger the Geiger counter that releases the hammer, smashes

13:18.660 --> 13:21.900
the bottle and the gas then kills the cat.

13:21.900 --> 13:27.020
If nothing is emitted then nothing will happen and the cat will live.

13:27.020 --> 13:29.580
Remember you can't see inside the box.

13:29.580 --> 13:33.260
But you know through quantum physics that the atom is in two states.

13:33.260 --> 13:38.560
It's released the particle and it hasn't released the particle, which means that the cat must

13:38.560 --> 13:42.100
be dead and alive at the same time.

13:42.100 --> 13:46.180
You can't open the box and see that because as soon as you open the box the cat appears

13:46.180 --> 13:49.620
to you in only one state, either alive or dead.

13:49.620 --> 13:54.000
One explanation is that there may be a parallel universe somewhere where the cat is in the

13:54.000 --> 13:55.540
other state.

13:55.540 --> 14:00.060
And if there are two universes to account for the dual state of a single particle, how

14:00.060 --> 14:04.940
many universes must there be to account for all the different states of all the different

14:04.940 --> 14:08.820
particles, an almost infinite number?

14:08.820 --> 14:13.820
Another more recent theory is that the quantum effect breaks down as objects get larger and

14:13.820 --> 14:17.000
the force of gravity becomes more significant.

14:17.000 --> 14:21.000
But the effect on a quantum scale is no less real.

14:21.000 --> 14:24.360
So if all this blows your mind, yes it should.

14:24.360 --> 14:29.240
Because the world of science, where space is curved, where time slows down when objects

14:29.240 --> 14:34.400
move faster and where particles can be in two places at the same time, in other words

14:34.400 --> 14:39.880
the world we actually live in, is far more fascinating than any mythological world of

14:39.880 --> 14:43.280
gods and goblins that we can invent.

14:43.280 --> 14:47.920
So there's no reason to believe there was only one Big Bang.

14:47.920 --> 14:52.360
Many physicists have suggested that Big Bangs may be happening all the time.

14:52.360 --> 14:56.900
We don't know of course, but we could be one of trillions of universes expanding like

14:56.900 --> 15:00.560
bubbles over billions of years and then dying.

15:00.560 --> 15:04.980
Which would mean there are thousands of universes where the values of the four forces are just

15:04.980 --> 15:07.680
right to form stars.

15:07.680 --> 15:11.880
Astrophysics and quantum physics may provide some theoretical evidence for this, but the

15:11.880 --> 15:15.560
plain fact is we just don't know yet.

15:15.560 --> 15:19.840
And making something up and being absolutely sure it's the blind, honest truth doesn't

15:19.840 --> 15:21.920
mean we do know.

15:21.920 --> 15:23.840
So what was the Big Bang?

15:23.840 --> 15:26.040
I mean our Big Bang.

15:26.040 --> 15:29.000
Fortunately PragerU has a course on this too.

15:29.000 --> 15:34.400
Here's another videocaster, I mean university lecturer, the late Frank Pastore.

15:34.400 --> 15:36.840
We're all familiar with the first Big Bang, right?

15:36.840 --> 15:41.200
It's usually the answer given to the question, why is there something rather than nothing?

15:41.640 --> 15:45.960
It's the idea that there was nothing, it popped and boom, there's something.

15:45.960 --> 15:52.360
I mean that time, matter and space all came into existence and some great cosmological

15:52.360 --> 15:53.360
flash about...

15:53.360 --> 15:58.280
OK, the first thing I always suggest creationists do if they want to rebut science is find out

15:58.280 --> 16:00.920
what the science actually says.

16:00.920 --> 16:05.700
The idea that there was a boom that caused matter to appear out of nowhere is not the

16:05.700 --> 16:11.060
Big Bang theory, it's what creationists think the Big Bang theory says.

16:11.060 --> 16:15.820
The theory, which is actually called cosmic inflation theory, says that matter came from

16:15.820 --> 16:19.120
singularity, a dense point of energy.

16:19.120 --> 16:22.460
After all, matter and energy are interchangeable.

16:22.460 --> 16:24.540
Where did singularity come from?

16:24.540 --> 16:30.220
Oddly that's a moot question because time in our universe began with the Big Bang, which

16:30.220 --> 16:36.920
means that singularity was, to all intents and purposes, timeless, it was eternal.

16:36.920 --> 16:42.120
Some creationists argue that that's impossible and yet their entire religion is based on

16:42.120 --> 16:44.960
the idea of something eternal.

16:44.960 --> 16:51.120
Time in our universe began when singularity expanded and energy condensed into matter.

16:51.120 --> 16:52.500
What caused that?

16:52.500 --> 16:57.660
The short answer is, again, we don't know and creationists don't know either.

16:57.660 --> 17:03.400
They can give it a name but whatever you want to call it, call it spin-axe, Fred-leg, god

17:03.400 --> 17:07.920
or doodlebug, we still need to know what that thing is and how it worked.

17:07.920 --> 17:10.000
Did it interact with another universe?

17:10.000 --> 17:13.180
How did expansion overcome gravitational forces?

17:13.180 --> 17:18.440
Is singularity a white hole, in other words a black hole in reverse, and if so how does

17:18.440 --> 17:24.440
a black hole reverse itself and instead of contracting space-time, expand it?

17:24.440 --> 17:28.840
These questions won't be answered by people in pulpits making things up, they'll be discovered

17:28.840 --> 17:33.380
in particle accelerators and radio telescope observatories.

17:33.380 --> 17:39.580
Because believe it or not, the hard part of physics isn't making up names for things.

17:39.580 --> 17:44.000
The best way to illustrate this is through Star Trek's transporter which measures each

17:44.000 --> 17:50.680
particle in the transportee's body and recreates it somewhere else in exactly the same configuration.

17:50.680 --> 17:56.260
It was a plot device used to avoid long and messy transfers between scenes but it presented

17:56.260 --> 18:00.060
Star Trek's creator with a scientific problem.

18:00.060 --> 18:04.980
According to the Heisenberg uncertainty principle, which is part of the Copenhagen interpretation,

18:04.980 --> 18:09.360
you can't measure both the position of a particle and its momentum.

18:09.360 --> 18:14.540
The more accurately you measure one, the less accurately you can measure the other.

18:14.540 --> 18:18.900
So Roddenberry decided that the transporter would include a device that can overcome the

18:18.900 --> 18:23.660
Heisenberg uncertainty principle, called a Heisenberg compensator.

18:23.660 --> 18:27.340
Someone once asked Star Trek's technical advisor how it worked.

18:27.340 --> 18:29.940
He answered, very well, thank you.

18:29.940 --> 18:34.720
That's the beauty of being able to just make things up and give them names, rather

18:34.720 --> 18:37.300
than having to explain how they work.

18:37.300 --> 18:40.100
A bit like this thing they're calling God.

18:40.100 --> 18:44.380
All creationists have done is give the cause of cosmic inflation a name.

18:44.380 --> 18:45.860
How did it work?

18:45.860 --> 18:49.980
Well erm, very successfully, thank you.

18:49.980 --> 18:54.300
So yes, you can make up any story you like that the Big Bang was caused by a giant rabbit

18:54.300 --> 18:59.100
or a bearded man or an invisible witch, and give it any name you like.

18:59.100 --> 19:04.000
But one thing we do know it was not is any of the gods we've invented on Earth, because

19:04.000 --> 19:10.000
these mythical figures allegedly performed deeds that we know never happened.

19:10.000 --> 19:13.580
Take the Japanese gods Izanagi and Izanami for example.

19:13.580 --> 19:17.900
They were supposed to have created the Japanese islands, but we now know that the Japanese

19:17.900 --> 19:21.580
islands were formed by the collision of crustal plates.

19:21.580 --> 19:28.940
The Chinese god Is-Nuea supposedly made humans out of clay, but we now know that humans evolved.

19:28.940 --> 19:33.180
And the Jewish god, who supposedly looks like us, is believed to have flooded the Earth

19:33.180 --> 19:38.300
a few thousand years ago and killed all the people and animals that inhabited it.

19:38.300 --> 19:42.380
But we now know that no such flood ever occurred.

19:42.380 --> 19:46.860
If you don't get why this dismisses the notion of these gods, it's like me telling

19:46.860 --> 19:51.940
you that a giant dragon has burnt down the White House with its fiery breath and killed

19:51.940 --> 19:53.520
everyone inside.

19:53.520 --> 19:56.980
If you go to Washington the same day I tell you this and discover that the White House

19:56.980 --> 20:02.940
is still there and everyone inside is still alive, you might suspect that this dragon

20:02.940 --> 20:05.760
is a figment of my imagination.

20:05.760 --> 20:09.680
Now how many times have I said in this video, we don't know.

20:09.680 --> 20:11.900
We don't know what caused the Big Bang.

20:11.900 --> 20:15.920
We don't know why a particle can be in two places at the same time.

20:15.920 --> 20:18.000
We don't know a lot of things.

20:18.000 --> 20:21.560
But conversely, there are also things we do know.

20:21.560 --> 20:26.360
We know that humans evolved and were not made out of clay by a Chinese goddess.

20:26.360 --> 20:30.860
And we know that an invisible god didn't flood the Earth a few thousand years ago because

20:30.860 --> 20:33.140
we know there was no such flood.

20:33.140 --> 20:38.480
So that's how we know that whatever force of physics caused the Big Bang, it's not going

20:38.480 --> 20:44.340
to be a mythical Bronze Age deity looking out for billions of years across the vast

20:44.340 --> 20:50.400
expanse of space, containing over a hundred billion galaxies, and then homing in on just

20:50.400 --> 20:56.260
one of those billions of galaxies, and then through the vast space within that galaxy

20:56.260 --> 21:02.460
containing hundreds of billions of stars, focusing his attention on just one star system

21:02.460 --> 21:09.020
and a tiny planet orbiting that very ordinary star and taking a keen interest in a chariot

21:09.020 --> 21:09.460
battle.

21:14.340 --> 21:16.340
Thank you.
