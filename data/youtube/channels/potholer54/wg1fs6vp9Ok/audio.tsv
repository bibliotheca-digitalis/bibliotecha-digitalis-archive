0	16000	For 100,000 years, humans have looked up at the night sky and wondered about those awesome
16000	22160	points of light. What are they? What are they made of? How did they get there? They didn't
22160	27720	have the technology to find out, so they guessed that magical beings had created it all. If
27720	32400	you prefer making wild guesses instead of using observation, measurement and calculation,
32400	37960	then here's a sealed box. Spend the next 10 minutes guessing what's inside and come back
37960	43320	again at the end of this video, because this video doesn't cover what we guess about the universe,
43320	49500	but what we know, and more importantly, how we know it. How do we know where the stars and
49500	58940	galaxies came from and how old they are? The first person to take a stab at gauging the scale
58940	64600	of the world around him was the Greek scientist Eratosthenes of Cyrene. He knew that on the
64600	69300	longest day of the year the Sun was directly overhead at Syene in the south of Egypt,
69300	75020	but cast a shadow in Alexandria to the north. By measuring the length of the shadow he could
75020	80700	work out the Earth's diameter. But while the Earth might be spherical, the dogma of a fixed
80700	87300	Earth still held sway, backed by a powerful church. Problem was, this didn't fit the observable
87300	93660	evidence, especially the observation that some wandering stars or planets in Greek had very
93660	99220	erratic orbits around the Earth. When the telescope was invented, these planets turned out to be very
99220	105340	different to the fixed stars. But it wasn't until Johannes Kepler calculated the exact orbits of the
105340	111700	planets that a model of the solar system at last fit the observations. His law of planetary motion
111700	121580	turned this into this. In the 18th century a transit of Venus across the Sun, timed at
121580	125940	opposite ends of the Earth, made it possible to calculate the exact distance of the Sun,
125940	132860	and by extension the distances of all the known planets. But that still left the stars. The easiest
132860	137660	way to measure their distance is a system called triangulation, which is used to measure distant
137660	143740	objects on Earth. With stars the baseline is the Earth's orbit around the Sun. Take an angle
143740	151620	measurement here, and six months later here, and just do the math. This principle was known in the
151620	157820	17th century that their instruments simply weren't accurate enough to measure such a tiny angle. But
157820	164580	in 1838 the technology had caught up. The Prussian astronomer Bessel found that the binary star 61
164580	171340	Cygni was an astounding 60 trillion miles away. It was a distance so huge that it had to be measured
171340	178540	in terms of the number of years it took light to cross it. 10.3 light-years. Our universe just got
178540	185060	bigger. Triangulation only works for stars up to a hundred light-years away, but it was a start.
185060	190580	Knowing the distances of these stars, astronomers could work out the relationship between a star's
190580	196820	distance and its brightness, because closer stars are generally brighter than distant ones. Using
196820	201060	this calculation they could now estimate the distance of the faintest stars they could see.
201060	207260	It was only an estimate, but our universe got bigger again. We seem to be on the edge of a
207300	214180	huge wheel of stars in space. While the brightness of a star gives us an estimate of its distance,
214180	220540	confirmation comes in another trick of triangulation. In 1987 a star was seen to
220540	227340	explode inside our galaxy. The exploding star is called a supernova, and it's very bright. As it
227340	233620	happened, this particular supernova was surrounded by a huge gas cloud far out into space. The light
233620	239900	from the exploding supernova raced across the gap, and eight months later it hit the surrounding gas
239900	246740	cloud. Cosmologists saw the reflective glow. We know the speed of light, so we know how far it
246740	251820	can travel in eight months, and that means we know the distance between the supernova and the gas
251820	256900	cloud. All cosmologists had to do is measure the angle between the two, as seen from Earth,
256900	262500	and once again its simple triangulation. We can work out the distance of the supernova,
262500	271540	169,000 light-years. That means we're looking at an event that happened 169,000 years ago.
271540	279300	Our universe was now huge. By simply observing and measuring, we'd calculated a scale in time
279300	285660	and space that was far greater than Bronze Age people ever imagined. But one question still
285700	291460	confounded scientists. What are all these stars made of? To understand the evidence,
291460	298140	we have to understand the atom. There are around 92 different types of atom, known as elements.
298140	304100	They differ in the number of electrons, protons, and neutrons they have. When an atom emits light,
304100	310100	it absorbs the light of particular wavelengths. Each element absorbs a different set of wavelengths.
310100	315660	We can see these absorption patterns as lines when we look through an instrument called a
315660	321340	spectroscope. This one shows the spectral lines of three elements that were very familiar to early
321340	327860	19th century scientists, hydrogen, lithium, and oxygen. But when the French astronomer Pierre
327860	334500	Janssen pointed a spectroscope at the Sun in 1868, he found a set of spectral lines no one
334500	341020	had ever seen before. It was a completely unknown element. He called it helium, after the Greek word
341020	347100	Helios, the Sun. The new element also showed up in stars, along with another abundant element,
347100	353300	hydrogen. Inside this tightly bound universe, which they called the galaxy, astronomers could
353300	357940	see strange swirling clouds through their telescopes. Some astronomers thought these
357940	365500	could be other galaxies, just like our own. In 1917, a supernova was seen to explode inside a
365500	373100	cloud called Andromeda. Supernovas are usually very bright, but this one was quite faint. Using
373100	377340	the brightness and distance calculation, cosmologists work out just how far away
377340	383500	Andromeda was, two million light-years. That put it well outside our own galaxy,
383540	390060	and triangulation showed just how big it was, about the size of our own galaxy. The universe,
390060	395860	it turned out, extended well beyond our own cluster of stars, and millions of years back in
395860	402020	time. American astronomer Edwin Hubble soon discovered that other galaxies were even further
402020	408020	away. He also confirmed an observation that they were all moving away from us at incredible speed.
408020	414380	Those furthest away were going the fastest. In other words, our universe was expanding,
414380	421620	as if we were caught up in a huge explosion. How do we know this? I'll explain with a more prosaic
421620	428540	example. When you watch a car speed past, sounding its horn, the pitch seems to change. As it's coming
428540	435140	towards you, the sound waves are bunched up, so the horn seems to have a high pitch. As it passes
435140	440820	by, the pitch suddenly drops, because now the sound waves are being stretched out. This is
440820	446140	called the Doppler effect. Just by measuring the change in pitch, an observer can calculate the
446140	452220	speed of the car, and whether it's coming towards him or moving away. We can do the same with stars
452220	458380	and galaxies, using light instead of sound. If a galaxy is moving away, the spectral lines will
458380	463300	shift towards the red end of the spectrum. The opposite happens if a galaxy is coming closer,
463340	468860	they move towards the blue end. So cosmologists could not only calculate which direction the
468860	475340	galaxies are moving, but also their speed. But what happens if we wind the film back, as it were?
475340	480940	What happens is that all these moving galaxies lead back to the same point in space and time,
480940	488980	this point, around 14 billion years ago. The explosion of all this matter is called the Big
489140	494340	Bang, and that's as far as we've got so far in our understanding of the scale and time span of
494340	499340	the universe. Research is now continuing to discover what happened before the Big Bang.
499340	506060	Now let's come back to that sealed box. To the people who decided to skip the video in order
506060	511940	to speculate on the contents, have you figured out what's inside yet? Of course not. Sitting in
511940	516940	an armchair and making wild guesses tells you nothing. You're really no better off than the
516940	522500	Bronze Age farmers who looked up at the stars and tried to guess what they were. Just because
522500	527140	the Big Bang is the current extent of our knowledge doesn't mean we've reached the end of the story.
527140	532380	Every time in history people thought they knew the scale of the universe, they've always been
532380	538500	proved wrong. To me the real story of the universe is way more interesting than myths and fairy
538500	545820	tales. For 100,000 years humans have stared up at the same night sky and wondered, we are the
545820	550380	first people in human history not to wonder, not to guess, but to know.
