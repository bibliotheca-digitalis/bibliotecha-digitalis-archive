00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:16,000
For 100,000 years, humans have looked up at the night sky and wondered about those awesome

2
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:22,160
points of light. What are they? What are they made of? How did they get there? They didn't

3
00:00:22,160 --> 00:00:27,720
have the technology to find out, so they guessed that magical beings had created it all. If

4
00:00:27,720 --> 00:00:32,400
you prefer making wild guesses instead of using observation, measurement and calculation,

5
00:00:32,400 --> 00:00:37,960
then here's a sealed box. Spend the next 10 minutes guessing what's inside and come back

6
00:00:37,960 --> 00:00:43,320
again at the end of this video, because this video doesn't cover what we guess about the universe,

7
00:00:43,320 --> 00:00:49,500
but what we know, and more importantly, how we know it. How do we know where the stars and

8
00:00:49,500 --> 00:00:58,940
galaxies came from and how old they are? The first person to take a stab at gauging the scale

9
00:00:58,940 --> 00:01:04,600
of the world around him was the Greek scientist Eratosthenes of Cyrene. He knew that on the

10
00:01:04,600 --> 00:01:09,300
longest day of the year the Sun was directly overhead at Syene in the south of Egypt,

11
00:01:09,300 --> 00:01:15,020
but cast a shadow in Alexandria to the north. By measuring the length of the shadow he could

12
00:01:15,020 --> 00:01:20,700
work out the Earth's diameter. But while the Earth might be spherical, the dogma of a fixed

13
00:01:20,700 --> 00:01:27,300
Earth still held sway, backed by a powerful church. Problem was, this didn't fit the observable

14
00:01:27,300 --> 00:01:33,660
evidence, especially the observation that some wandering stars or planets in Greek had very

15
00:01:33,660 --> 00:01:39,220
erratic orbits around the Earth. When the telescope was invented, these planets turned out to be very

16
00:01:39,220 --> 00:01:45,340
different to the fixed stars. But it wasn't until Johannes Kepler calculated the exact orbits of the

17
00:01:45,340 --> 00:01:51,700
planets that a model of the solar system at last fit the observations. His law of planetary motion

18
00:01:51,700 --> 00:02:01,580
turned this into this. In the 18th century a transit of Venus across the Sun, timed at

19
00:02:01,580 --> 00:02:05,940
opposite ends of the Earth, made it possible to calculate the exact distance of the Sun,

20
00:02:05,940 --> 00:02:12,860
and by extension the distances of all the known planets. But that still left the stars. The easiest

21
00:02:12,860 --> 00:02:17,660
way to measure their distance is a system called triangulation, which is used to measure distant

22
00:02:17,660 --> 00:02:23,740
objects on Earth. With stars the baseline is the Earth's orbit around the Sun. Take an angle

23
00:02:23,740 --> 00:02:31,620
measurement here, and six months later here, and just do the math. This principle was known in the

24
00:02:31,620 --> 00:02:37,820
17th century that their instruments simply weren't accurate enough to measure such a tiny angle. But

25
00:02:37,820 --> 00:02:44,580
in 1838 the technology had caught up. The Prussian astronomer Bessel found that the binary star 61

26
00:02:44,580 --> 00:02:51,340
Cygni was an astounding 60 trillion miles away. It was a distance so huge that it had to be measured

27
00:02:51,340 --> 00:02:58,540
in terms of the number of years it took light to cross it. 10.3 light-years. Our universe just got

28
00:02:58,540 --> 00:03:05,060
bigger. Triangulation only works for stars up to a hundred light-years away, but it was a start.

29
00:03:05,060 --> 00:03:10,580
Knowing the distances of these stars, astronomers could work out the relationship between a star's

30
00:03:10,580 --> 00:03:16,820
distance and its brightness, because closer stars are generally brighter than distant ones. Using

31
00:03:16,820 --> 00:03:21,060
this calculation they could now estimate the distance of the faintest stars they could see.

32
00:03:21,060 --> 00:03:27,260
It was only an estimate, but our universe got bigger again. We seem to be on the edge of a

33
00:03:27,300 --> 00:03:34,180
huge wheel of stars in space. While the brightness of a star gives us an estimate of its distance,

34
00:03:34,180 --> 00:03:40,540
confirmation comes in another trick of triangulation. In 1987 a star was seen to

35
00:03:40,540 --> 00:03:47,340
explode inside our galaxy. The exploding star is called a supernova, and it's very bright. As it

36
00:03:47,340 --> 00:03:53,620
happened, this particular supernova was surrounded by a huge gas cloud far out into space. The light

37
00:03:53,620 --> 00:03:59,900
from the exploding supernova raced across the gap, and eight months later it hit the surrounding gas

38
00:03:59,900 --> 00:04:06,740
cloud. Cosmologists saw the reflective glow. We know the speed of light, so we know how far it

39
00:04:06,740 --> 00:04:11,820
can travel in eight months, and that means we know the distance between the supernova and the gas

40
00:04:11,820 --> 00:04:16,900
cloud. All cosmologists had to do is measure the angle between the two, as seen from Earth,

41
00:04:16,900 --> 00:04:22,500
and once again its simple triangulation. We can work out the distance of the supernova,

42
00:04:22,500 --> 00:04:31,540
169,000 light-years. That means we're looking at an event that happened 169,000 years ago.

43
00:04:31,540 --> 00:04:39,300
Our universe was now huge. By simply observing and measuring, we'd calculated a scale in time

44
00:04:39,300 --> 00:04:45,660
and space that was far greater than Bronze Age people ever imagined. But one question still

45
00:04:45,700 --> 00:04:51,460
confounded scientists. What are all these stars made of? To understand the evidence,

46
00:04:51,460 --> 00:04:58,140
we have to understand the atom. There are around 92 different types of atom, known as elements.

47
00:04:58,140 --> 00:05:04,100
They differ in the number of electrons, protons, and neutrons they have. When an atom emits light,

48
00:05:04,100 --> 00:05:10,100
it absorbs the light of particular wavelengths. Each element absorbs a different set of wavelengths.

49
00:05:10,100 --> 00:05:15,660
We can see these absorption patterns as lines when we look through an instrument called a

50
00:05:15,660 --> 00:05:21,340
spectroscope. This one shows the spectral lines of three elements that were very familiar to early

51
00:05:21,340 --> 00:05:27,860
19th century scientists, hydrogen, lithium, and oxygen. But when the French astronomer Pierre

52
00:05:27,860 --> 00:05:34,500
Janssen pointed a spectroscope at the Sun in 1868, he found a set of spectral lines no one

53
00:05:34,500 --> 00:05:41,020
had ever seen before. It was a completely unknown element. He called it helium, after the Greek word

54
00:05:41,020 --> 00:05:47,100
Helios, the Sun. The new element also showed up in stars, along with another abundant element,

55
00:05:47,100 --> 00:05:53,300
hydrogen. Inside this tightly bound universe, which they called the galaxy, astronomers could

56
00:05:53,300 --> 00:05:57,940
see strange swirling clouds through their telescopes. Some astronomers thought these

57
00:05:57,940 --> 00:06:05,500
could be other galaxies, just like our own. In 1917, a supernova was seen to explode inside a

58
00:06:05,500 --> 00:06:13,100
cloud called Andromeda. Supernovas are usually very bright, but this one was quite faint. Using

59
00:06:13,100 --> 00:06:17,340
the brightness and distance calculation, cosmologists work out just how far away

60
00:06:17,340 --> 00:06:23,500
Andromeda was, two million light-years. That put it well outside our own galaxy,

61
00:06:23,540 --> 00:06:30,060
and triangulation showed just how big it was, about the size of our own galaxy. The universe,

62
00:06:30,060 --> 00:06:35,860
it turned out, extended well beyond our own cluster of stars, and millions of years back in

63
00:06:35,860 --> 00:06:42,020
time. American astronomer Edwin Hubble soon discovered that other galaxies were even further

64
00:06:42,020 --> 00:06:48,020
away. He also confirmed an observation that they were all moving away from us at incredible speed.

65
00:06:48,020 --> 00:06:54,380
Those furthest away were going the fastest. In other words, our universe was expanding,

66
00:06:54,380 --> 00:07:01,620
as if we were caught up in a huge explosion. How do we know this? I'll explain with a more prosaic

67
00:07:01,620 --> 00:07:08,540
example. When you watch a car speed past, sounding its horn, the pitch seems to change. As it's coming

68
00:07:08,540 --> 00:07:15,140
towards you, the sound waves are bunched up, so the horn seems to have a high pitch. As it passes

69
00:07:15,140 --> 00:07:20,820
by, the pitch suddenly drops, because now the sound waves are being stretched out. This is

70
00:07:20,820 --> 00:07:26,140
called the Doppler effect. Just by measuring the change in pitch, an observer can calculate the

71
00:07:26,140 --> 00:07:32,220
speed of the car, and whether it's coming towards him or moving away. We can do the same with stars

72
00:07:32,220 --> 00:07:38,380
and galaxies, using light instead of sound. If a galaxy is moving away, the spectral lines will

73
00:07:38,380 --> 00:07:43,300
shift towards the red end of the spectrum. The opposite happens if a galaxy is coming closer,

74
00:07:43,340 --> 00:07:48,860
they move towards the blue end. So cosmologists could not only calculate which direction the

75
00:07:48,860 --> 00:07:55,340
galaxies are moving, but also their speed. But what happens if we wind the film back, as it were?

76
00:07:55,340 --> 00:08:00,940
What happens is that all these moving galaxies lead back to the same point in space and time,

77
00:08:00,940 --> 00:08:08,980
this point, around 14 billion years ago. The explosion of all this matter is called the Big

78
00:08:09,140 --> 00:08:14,340
Bang, and that's as far as we've got so far in our understanding of the scale and time span of

79
00:08:14,340 --> 00:08:19,340
the universe. Research is now continuing to discover what happened before the Big Bang.

80
00:08:19,340 --> 00:08:26,060
Now let's come back to that sealed box. To the people who decided to skip the video in order

81
00:08:26,060 --> 00:08:31,940
to speculate on the contents, have you figured out what's inside yet? Of course not. Sitting in

82
00:08:31,940 --> 00:08:36,940
an armchair and making wild guesses tells you nothing. You're really no better off than the

83
00:08:36,940 --> 00:08:42,500
Bronze Age farmers who looked up at the stars and tried to guess what they were. Just because

84
00:08:42,500 --> 00:08:47,140
the Big Bang is the current extent of our knowledge doesn't mean we've reached the end of the story.

85
00:08:47,140 --> 00:08:52,380
Every time in history people thought they knew the scale of the universe, they've always been

86
00:08:52,380 --> 00:08:58,500
proved wrong. To me the real story of the universe is way more interesting than myths and fairy

87
00:08:58,500 --> 00:09:05,820
tales. For 100,000 years humans have stared up at the same night sky and wondered, we are the

88
00:09:05,820 --> 00:09:10,380
first people in human history not to wonder, not to guess, but to know.
