00:00.000 --> 00:16.000
For 100,000 years, humans have looked up at the night sky and wondered about those awesome

00:16.000 --> 00:22.160
points of light. What are they? What are they made of? How did they get there? They didn't

00:22.160 --> 00:27.720
have the technology to find out, so they guessed that magical beings had created it all. If

00:27.720 --> 00:32.400
you prefer making wild guesses instead of using observation, measurement and calculation,

00:32.400 --> 00:37.960
then here's a sealed box. Spend the next 10 minutes guessing what's inside and come back

00:37.960 --> 00:43.320
again at the end of this video, because this video doesn't cover what we guess about the universe,

00:43.320 --> 00:49.500
but what we know, and more importantly, how we know it. How do we know where the stars and

00:49.500 --> 00:58.940
galaxies came from and how old they are? The first person to take a stab at gauging the scale

00:58.940 --> 01:04.600
of the world around him was the Greek scientist Eratosthenes of Cyrene. He knew that on the

01:04.600 --> 01:09.300
longest day of the year the Sun was directly overhead at Syene in the south of Egypt,

01:09.300 --> 01:15.020
but cast a shadow in Alexandria to the north. By measuring the length of the shadow he could

01:15.020 --> 01:20.700
work out the Earth's diameter. But while the Earth might be spherical, the dogma of a fixed

01:20.700 --> 01:27.300
Earth still held sway, backed by a powerful church. Problem was, this didn't fit the observable

01:27.300 --> 01:33.660
evidence, especially the observation that some wandering stars or planets in Greek had very

01:33.660 --> 01:39.220
erratic orbits around the Earth. When the telescope was invented, these planets turned out to be very

01:39.220 --> 01:45.340
different to the fixed stars. But it wasn't until Johannes Kepler calculated the exact orbits of the

01:45.340 --> 01:51.700
planets that a model of the solar system at last fit the observations. His law of planetary motion

01:51.700 --> 02:01.580
turned this into this. In the 18th century a transit of Venus across the Sun, timed at

02:01.580 --> 02:05.940
opposite ends of the Earth, made it possible to calculate the exact distance of the Sun,

02:05.940 --> 02:12.860
and by extension the distances of all the known planets. But that still left the stars. The easiest

02:12.860 --> 02:17.660
way to measure their distance is a system called triangulation, which is used to measure distant

02:17.660 --> 02:23.740
objects on Earth. With stars the baseline is the Earth's orbit around the Sun. Take an angle

02:23.740 --> 02:31.620
measurement here, and six months later here, and just do the math. This principle was known in the

02:31.620 --> 02:37.820
17th century that their instruments simply weren't accurate enough to measure such a tiny angle. But

02:37.820 --> 02:44.580
in 1838 the technology had caught up. The Prussian astronomer Bessel found that the binary star 61

02:44.580 --> 02:51.340
Cygni was an astounding 60 trillion miles away. It was a distance so huge that it had to be measured

02:51.340 --> 02:58.540
in terms of the number of years it took light to cross it. 10.3 light-years. Our universe just got

02:58.540 --> 03:05.060
bigger. Triangulation only works for stars up to a hundred light-years away, but it was a start.

03:05.060 --> 03:10.580
Knowing the distances of these stars, astronomers could work out the relationship between a star's

03:10.580 --> 03:16.820
distance and its brightness, because closer stars are generally brighter than distant ones. Using

03:16.820 --> 03:21.060
this calculation they could now estimate the distance of the faintest stars they could see.

03:21.060 --> 03:27.260
It was only an estimate, but our universe got bigger again. We seem to be on the edge of a

03:27.300 --> 03:34.180
huge wheel of stars in space. While the brightness of a star gives us an estimate of its distance,

03:34.180 --> 03:40.540
confirmation comes in another trick of triangulation. In 1987 a star was seen to

03:40.540 --> 03:47.340
explode inside our galaxy. The exploding star is called a supernova, and it's very bright. As it

03:47.340 --> 03:53.620
happened, this particular supernova was surrounded by a huge gas cloud far out into space. The light

03:53.620 --> 03:59.900
from the exploding supernova raced across the gap, and eight months later it hit the surrounding gas

03:59.900 --> 04:06.740
cloud. Cosmologists saw the reflective glow. We know the speed of light, so we know how far it

04:06.740 --> 04:11.820
can travel in eight months, and that means we know the distance between the supernova and the gas

04:11.820 --> 04:16.900
cloud. All cosmologists had to do is measure the angle between the two, as seen from Earth,

04:16.900 --> 04:22.500
and once again its simple triangulation. We can work out the distance of the supernova,

04:22.500 --> 04:31.540
169,000 light-years. That means we're looking at an event that happened 169,000 years ago.

04:31.540 --> 04:39.300
Our universe was now huge. By simply observing and measuring, we'd calculated a scale in time

04:39.300 --> 04:45.660
and space that was far greater than Bronze Age people ever imagined. But one question still

04:45.700 --> 04:51.460
confounded scientists. What are all these stars made of? To understand the evidence,

04:51.460 --> 04:58.140
we have to understand the atom. There are around 92 different types of atom, known as elements.

04:58.140 --> 05:04.100
They differ in the number of electrons, protons, and neutrons they have. When an atom emits light,

05:04.100 --> 05:10.100
it absorbs the light of particular wavelengths. Each element absorbs a different set of wavelengths.

05:10.100 --> 05:15.660
We can see these absorption patterns as lines when we look through an instrument called a

05:15.660 --> 05:21.340
spectroscope. This one shows the spectral lines of three elements that were very familiar to early

05:21.340 --> 05:27.860
19th century scientists, hydrogen, lithium, and oxygen. But when the French astronomer Pierre

05:27.860 --> 05:34.500
Janssen pointed a spectroscope at the Sun in 1868, he found a set of spectral lines no one

05:34.500 --> 05:41.020
had ever seen before. It was a completely unknown element. He called it helium, after the Greek word

05:41.020 --> 05:47.100
Helios, the Sun. The new element also showed up in stars, along with another abundant element,

05:47.100 --> 05:53.300
hydrogen. Inside this tightly bound universe, which they called the galaxy, astronomers could

05:53.300 --> 05:57.940
see strange swirling clouds through their telescopes. Some astronomers thought these

05:57.940 --> 06:05.500
could be other galaxies, just like our own. In 1917, a supernova was seen to explode inside a

06:05.500 --> 06:13.100
cloud called Andromeda. Supernovas are usually very bright, but this one was quite faint. Using

06:13.100 --> 06:17.340
the brightness and distance calculation, cosmologists work out just how far away

06:17.340 --> 06:23.500
Andromeda was, two million light-years. That put it well outside our own galaxy,

06:23.540 --> 06:30.060
and triangulation showed just how big it was, about the size of our own galaxy. The universe,

06:30.060 --> 06:35.860
it turned out, extended well beyond our own cluster of stars, and millions of years back in

06:35.860 --> 06:42.020
time. American astronomer Edwin Hubble soon discovered that other galaxies were even further

06:42.020 --> 06:48.020
away. He also confirmed an observation that they were all moving away from us at incredible speed.

06:48.020 --> 06:54.380
Those furthest away were going the fastest. In other words, our universe was expanding,

06:54.380 --> 07:01.620
as if we were caught up in a huge explosion. How do we know this? I'll explain with a more prosaic

07:01.620 --> 07:08.540
example. When you watch a car speed past, sounding its horn, the pitch seems to change. As it's coming

07:08.540 --> 07:15.140
towards you, the sound waves are bunched up, so the horn seems to have a high pitch. As it passes

07:15.140 --> 07:20.820
by, the pitch suddenly drops, because now the sound waves are being stretched out. This is

07:20.820 --> 07:26.140
called the Doppler effect. Just by measuring the change in pitch, an observer can calculate the

07:26.140 --> 07:32.220
speed of the car, and whether it's coming towards him or moving away. We can do the same with stars

07:32.220 --> 07:38.380
and galaxies, using light instead of sound. If a galaxy is moving away, the spectral lines will

07:38.380 --> 07:43.300
shift towards the red end of the spectrum. The opposite happens if a galaxy is coming closer,

07:43.340 --> 07:48.860
they move towards the blue end. So cosmologists could not only calculate which direction the

07:48.860 --> 07:55.340
galaxies are moving, but also their speed. But what happens if we wind the film back, as it were?

07:55.340 --> 08:00.940
What happens is that all these moving galaxies lead back to the same point in space and time,

08:00.940 --> 08:08.980
this point, around 14 billion years ago. The explosion of all this matter is called the Big

08:09.140 --> 08:14.340
Bang, and that's as far as we've got so far in our understanding of the scale and time span of

08:14.340 --> 08:19.340
the universe. Research is now continuing to discover what happened before the Big Bang.

08:19.340 --> 08:26.060
Now let's come back to that sealed box. To the people who decided to skip the video in order

08:26.060 --> 08:31.940
to speculate on the contents, have you figured out what's inside yet? Of course not. Sitting in

08:31.940 --> 08:36.940
an armchair and making wild guesses tells you nothing. You're really no better off than the

08:36.940 --> 08:42.500
Bronze Age farmers who looked up at the stars and tried to guess what they were. Just because

08:42.500 --> 08:47.140
the Big Bang is the current extent of our knowledge doesn't mean we've reached the end of the story.

08:47.140 --> 08:52.380
Every time in history people thought they knew the scale of the universe, they've always been

08:52.380 --> 08:58.500
proved wrong. To me the real story of the universe is way more interesting than myths and fairy

08:58.500 --> 09:05.820
tales. For 100,000 years humans have stared up at the same night sky and wondered, we are the

09:05.820 --> 09:10.380
first people in human history not to wonder, not to guess, but to know.
