00:00.000 --> 00:07.960
No, I'm not going to give you the latest pronouncements from Al Gore on the subject of climate change.

00:07.960 --> 00:12.460
Al's not a scientist, let alone a geologist or a climatologist.

00:12.460 --> 00:13.920
And neither are these guys.

00:13.920 --> 00:20.000
However well-meaning they may be, most environmental activists don't know a schist from Shinola.

00:20.000 --> 00:24.700
And the same goes for climate prognosticators like Rush Limbaugh and Paul Harvey.

00:24.700 --> 00:29.820
This video is about science, and the debate between climate scientists.

00:29.820 --> 00:34.820
I'm not going to descend into political jargon by talking about climate change believers,

00:34.820 --> 00:38.820
as if the issue depends on faith rather than a strong body of evidence.

00:38.820 --> 00:41.820
And I'm not going to talk about climate change deniers,

00:41.820 --> 00:47.480
as if there's an absolute and unassailable truth that they're deliberately refusing to see.

00:47.480 --> 00:53.780
No, there are climate scientists who are proponents of the idea that climate change is being driven by man-made causes,

00:53.780 --> 00:56.920
and there are climate scientists who are skeptics.

00:56.920 --> 01:00.920
So let's start by looking at how we got to the current state of debate.

01:00.920 --> 01:06.920
Our atmosphere is composed mainly of nitrogen gas, a lot of oxygen, and then smaller amounts of other gases,

01:06.920 --> 01:09.920
like water vapour, carbon dioxide and methane.

01:09.920 --> 01:15.920
Most radiation from the sun passes right through these gases because it has a short wavelength.

01:15.920 --> 01:20.920
The radiation heats up the ground and is re-emitted as long-wavelength radiation,

01:20.920 --> 01:25.920
the kind of infrared heat you feel from a hot electric stove or a warm sidewalk.

01:25.920 --> 01:32.920
But although water vapour, carbon dioxide and methane molecules allowed most of this short-wave radiation to pass right through them,

01:32.920 --> 01:35.920
they absorb the long-wave radiation.

01:35.920 --> 01:39.920
This causes them to vibrate, and of course vibration is heat.

01:39.920 --> 01:42.920
They radiate this heat through the atmosphere.

01:42.920 --> 01:45.920
This is the so-called greenhouse effect.

01:45.920 --> 01:49.920
But in fact the physics is quite different to a greenhouse, so I dislike the term.

01:49.920 --> 01:54.920
Of the three so-called greenhouse gases, two of them are being produced by human activity,

01:54.920 --> 01:58.920
so it would be more accurate to describe these as carbon gases.

01:58.920 --> 02:04.920
If none of these three gases was there, the long-wave radiation from the ground would simply radiate into space.

02:04.920 --> 02:08.920
The earth would be a frigid planet, as cold as the moon.

02:08.920 --> 02:13.920
So of course the opposite is true, that if these gases were abundant in the atmosphere,

02:13.920 --> 02:18.920
most of the long-wave radiation would be trapped and the earth would heat up like a sauna.

02:18.920 --> 02:23.920
Proponents and skeptics all agree on this because it is well-established basic physics.

02:23.920 --> 02:29.920
Long-wave radiation absorption by carbon dioxide was first discovered over 150 years ago.

02:29.920 --> 02:34.920
A hundred years ago the Swedish scientist Svante Arrhenius suggested that theoretically,

02:34.920 --> 02:40.920
if carbon dioxide levels were to increase drastically in the atmosphere, the world would heat up.

02:40.920 --> 02:46.920
In an age of horse-drawn carriages the idea was interesting, but not something to worry about.

02:46.920 --> 02:52.920
But by the 1950s there was enough concern to begin the world's first monitoring of carbon dioxide levels.

02:52.920 --> 02:59.920
And in the 1970s studies conducted by the US Department of Energy showed that increasing industrialisation

02:59.920 --> 03:03.920
could very soon produce what's become known as the greenhouse effect.

03:03.920 --> 03:08.920
The emphasis is on the word could, because there were two schools of thought.

03:08.920 --> 03:13.920
One possibility was that tiny droplets of pollution in the atmosphere, so-called aerosols,

03:13.920 --> 03:21.920
would reflect the sun's radiation back into space and that would tend to overcome any warming effect from increased carbon dioxide.

03:21.920 --> 03:28.920
It could even cause the earth to cool down, sparking another ice age. This became known as global dimming.

03:28.920 --> 03:37.920
The other possibility was that the build-up of carbon dioxide would be so great that global warming would overcome any cooling caused by reflective aerosols.

03:37.920 --> 03:45.920
By the 1980s the contest between global warming and global dimming was pretty much settled by temperature readings on the ground.

03:45.920 --> 03:52.920
The earth wasn't getting cooler, it was getting hotter, and the 1980s turned out to be the hottest decade on record.

03:52.920 --> 03:56.920
By the way, we'll look at some of the flaws in temperature reading in a later video.

03:56.920 --> 04:02.920
I began reporting on this issue in 1992 when new data threw a curveball.

04:02.920 --> 04:10.920
Crucially, although temperatures on the earth's surface were rising, satellite measurements of temperatures in the lower troposphere showed a distinct cooling.

04:10.920 --> 04:18.920
All the computer models showed that the earth should be warming in the lower troposphere, and since it was cooling the models had to be wrong.

04:18.920 --> 04:22.920
But all the other evidence for a warming earth was clear and compelling.

04:22.920 --> 04:29.920
Ice was rapidly melting in Greenland, glaciers were retreating, and Antarctic ice sheets were breaking away.

04:29.920 --> 04:36.920
By 1997 there was more than enough evidence for the world to take concerted action, or at least try to.

04:36.920 --> 04:44.920
That year I was sent to Kyoto to cover the Framework Convention on Climate Change, which resulted in what became known as the Kyoto Protocol.

04:44.920 --> 04:49.920
Compared to the early 1990s I was struck by how a lot of attitudes had changed.

04:49.920 --> 05:01.920
Most of the skeptics had become convinced by the increasing weight of evidence, and the majority opinion was that climate change was real, and that man-made carbon gases played a crucial role.

05:01.920 --> 05:11.920
Then in 2005 scientists in California reanalysed the 1992 data that showed cooling in the lower troposphere, and they found a crucial error.

05:11.920 --> 05:16.920
The orbit of the satellite taking the temperature readings had degraded.

05:16.920 --> 05:24.920
It had started life taking temperatures over the equator at two o'clock in the afternoon, but by the late 1990s it was taking the readings at five o'clock.

05:24.920 --> 05:30.920
Hardly surprising, then, that the satellite had been recording a decrease in temperature over the years.

05:30.920 --> 05:35.920
The discovery knocked out the final piece of evidence that contradicted global warming.

05:35.920 --> 05:38.920
The computer models had been right all along.

05:38.920 --> 05:45.920
At last the models of how the climate should be performing with increased carbon dioxide matched how it was performing.

05:45.920 --> 05:54.920
Even most skeptics now accepted that the earth was warming, but that didn't necessarily mean that the warming was caused by man-made carbon gases.

05:54.920 --> 06:02.920
And just as the lower troposphere anomaly was resolved, another argument arose, the 800-year carbon dioxide lag time.

06:02.920 --> 06:09.920
At the Vostok station in Antarctica, an ice core was drilled looking back 420,000 years in time.

06:09.920 --> 06:13.920
You can see an explanation of how this works in my video The Ice Age.

06:13.920 --> 06:19.920
Climatologists were able to measure both the temperature and the carbon dioxide content of the atmosphere.

06:19.920 --> 06:28.920
In his film An Inconvenient Truth, Al Gore used a graph like this to show a correlation between carbon dioxide levels and increased temperatures.

06:28.920 --> 06:35.920
But he obscured the fact that the carbon dioxide increases lag the temperature increases by 800 years.

06:35.920 --> 06:42.920
If carbon dioxide is supposed to cause global warming, as Gore claims, the lag time would suggest it's the other way round.

06:42.920 --> 06:48.920
Well, yes, and yes, let's look at the science, not the hype.

06:48.920 --> 06:56.920
In my video The Ice Age, I said there was a trigger that set off a vicious circle of events, each tipping the earth into a cooling or a warming phase.

06:56.920 --> 07:04.920
In scientific terms, the vicious circle is called positive feedback, and it's best explained by looking at some weights on a balanced plank.

07:04.920 --> 07:12.920
If the weights are equidistant from the pivot point, the plank is in balance. A slight offset will tilt the plank, but it won't upset the balance.

07:12.920 --> 07:19.920
But let's say one of the weights is round and is moved half an inch. This causes the plank to tilt slightly.

07:19.920 --> 07:29.920
But the tilt causes the weight to roll a bit, and the shift in position causes the plank to tilt a bit more, until soon there's a runaway event and the plank comes crashing to the ground.

07:29.920 --> 07:43.920
We know that similar positive feedback happened during the Ice Ages. Each cooling and warming phase is amplified, so that a tiny bit of cooling ends up freezing half the planet, and a tiny bit of warming ends up thawing it out again.

07:43.920 --> 07:51.920
But each time something had to act as that initial trigger. Something had to nudge the round weight just a fraction.

07:51.920 --> 07:59.920
A strong contender has always been regular cyclical deviation in the earth's position or orbit, changing the amount of sunlight the earth received.

07:59.920 --> 08:09.920
Whatever it was, in the depths of the Ice Age this change melted a tiny part of the ice sheet and released carbon gases from the soil and from the warmer oceans.

08:09.920 --> 08:18.920
The carbon gases that were released trapped more long-wave radiation and warmed the planet a bit more, and that released more carbon gases, and so on.

08:18.920 --> 08:29.920
Climate change proponents have never suggested that a carbon dioxide increase was the trigger for past warming, only that the trigger released carbon gases, which set off this vicious circle of heating.

08:29.920 --> 08:36.920
So the lag time shown in the Vostok ice core isn't disputed, and the reasons for it are part of the global warming model.

08:36.920 --> 08:41.920
But without a trigger, this positive feedback wouldn't even begin.

08:41.920 --> 08:47.920
So if the trigger was a cyclical variation in the earth's position, then we don't have anything to worry about, right?

08:47.920 --> 08:54.920
Because, as we saw in the video The Ice Age, the earth's orbit will remain steady for another 16,000 years.

08:54.920 --> 09:00.920
The problem is, anything that causes a tiny increase in temperature can trigger this vicious circle.

09:00.920 --> 09:07.920
And the premise of the climate change proponents is that our industrial output of carbon dioxide itself is now the trigger.

09:07.920 --> 09:24.920
They calculate that the dramatic rise we've seen in carbon dioxide levels over the last hundred years will increase temperatures just enough to trigger a positive feedback loop that will result in more greenhouse gases, causing more warming, causing the release of more greenhouse gases, and so on.

09:24.920 --> 09:34.920
This is already being seen. For example, in Siberia, melting ice is thawing out millions of square miles of marsh, producing tons of methane gas.

09:34.920 --> 09:40.920
Methane is a more potent greenhouse gas than carbon dioxide, but it's much less abundant in the atmosphere.

09:40.920 --> 09:49.920
Even so, the methane which goes into the atmosphere adds to global warming, creating more marshland, which releases more methane.

09:49.920 --> 09:58.920
The 800-year lag time may be a wonderful debating point in the ideological war, but it barely touches the real discussion going on among climate scientists.

09:58.920 --> 10:07.920
So what is the debate going on in that field? To say that there's no debate is nonsense. There's always a debate about every scientific issue.

10:07.920 --> 10:21.920
But to claim there's no consensus is equally false. There are many ways to measure the views of climate scientists, and as we'll see in a later video, it's clear that the overwhelming majority accept the role of man-made gases in global warming.

10:21.920 --> 10:27.920
But however unequal the debate might be, there are still dissenting views of qualified skeptics.

10:27.920 --> 10:37.920
In the next video, I want to look at some scientific papers that suggest two alternative hypotheses on climate change, neither of which has anything to do with carbon gases.
