0	7960	No, I'm not going to give you the latest pronouncements from Al Gore on the subject of climate change.
7960	12460	Al's not a scientist, let alone a geologist or a climatologist.
12460	13920	And neither are these guys.
13920	20000	However well-meaning they may be, most environmental activists don't know a schist from Shinola.
20000	24700	And the same goes for climate prognosticators like Rush Limbaugh and Paul Harvey.
24700	29820	This video is about science, and the debate between climate scientists.
29820	34820	I'm not going to descend into political jargon by talking about climate change believers,
34820	38820	as if the issue depends on faith rather than a strong body of evidence.
38820	41820	And I'm not going to talk about climate change deniers,
41820	47480	as if there's an absolute and unassailable truth that they're deliberately refusing to see.
47480	53780	No, there are climate scientists who are proponents of the idea that climate change is being driven by man-made causes,
53780	56920	and there are climate scientists who are skeptics.
56920	60920	So let's start by looking at how we got to the current state of debate.
60920	66920	Our atmosphere is composed mainly of nitrogen gas, a lot of oxygen, and then smaller amounts of other gases,
66920	69920	like water vapour, carbon dioxide and methane.
69920	75920	Most radiation from the sun passes right through these gases because it has a short wavelength.
75920	80920	The radiation heats up the ground and is re-emitted as long-wavelength radiation,
80920	85920	the kind of infrared heat you feel from a hot electric stove or a warm sidewalk.
85920	92920	But although water vapour, carbon dioxide and methane molecules allowed most of this short-wave radiation to pass right through them,
92920	95920	they absorb the long-wave radiation.
95920	99920	This causes them to vibrate, and of course vibration is heat.
99920	102920	They radiate this heat through the atmosphere.
102920	105920	This is the so-called greenhouse effect.
105920	109920	But in fact the physics is quite different to a greenhouse, so I dislike the term.
109920	114920	Of the three so-called greenhouse gases, two of them are being produced by human activity,
114920	118920	so it would be more accurate to describe these as carbon gases.
118920	124920	If none of these three gases was there, the long-wave radiation from the ground would simply radiate into space.
124920	128920	The earth would be a frigid planet, as cold as the moon.
128920	133920	So of course the opposite is true, that if these gases were abundant in the atmosphere,
133920	138920	most of the long-wave radiation would be trapped and the earth would heat up like a sauna.
138920	143920	Proponents and skeptics all agree on this because it is well-established basic physics.
143920	149920	Long-wave radiation absorption by carbon dioxide was first discovered over 150 years ago.
149920	154920	A hundred years ago the Swedish scientist Svante Arrhenius suggested that theoretically,
154920	160920	if carbon dioxide levels were to increase drastically in the atmosphere, the world would heat up.
160920	166920	In an age of horse-drawn carriages the idea was interesting, but not something to worry about.
166920	172920	But by the 1950s there was enough concern to begin the world's first monitoring of carbon dioxide levels.
172920	179920	And in the 1970s studies conducted by the US Department of Energy showed that increasing industrialisation
179920	183920	could very soon produce what's become known as the greenhouse effect.
183920	188920	The emphasis is on the word could, because there were two schools of thought.
188920	193920	One possibility was that tiny droplets of pollution in the atmosphere, so-called aerosols,
193920	201920	would reflect the sun's radiation back into space and that would tend to overcome any warming effect from increased carbon dioxide.
201920	208920	It could even cause the earth to cool down, sparking another ice age. This became known as global dimming.
208920	217920	The other possibility was that the build-up of carbon dioxide would be so great that global warming would overcome any cooling caused by reflective aerosols.
217920	225920	By the 1980s the contest between global warming and global dimming was pretty much settled by temperature readings on the ground.
225920	232920	The earth wasn't getting cooler, it was getting hotter, and the 1980s turned out to be the hottest decade on record.
232920	236920	By the way, we'll look at some of the flaws in temperature reading in a later video.
236920	242920	I began reporting on this issue in 1992 when new data threw a curveball.
242920	250920	Crucially, although temperatures on the earth's surface were rising, satellite measurements of temperatures in the lower troposphere showed a distinct cooling.
250920	258920	All the computer models showed that the earth should be warming in the lower troposphere, and since it was cooling the models had to be wrong.
258920	262920	But all the other evidence for a warming earth was clear and compelling.
262920	269920	Ice was rapidly melting in Greenland, glaciers were retreating, and Antarctic ice sheets were breaking away.
269920	276920	By 1997 there was more than enough evidence for the world to take concerted action, or at least try to.
276920	284920	That year I was sent to Kyoto to cover the Framework Convention on Climate Change, which resulted in what became known as the Kyoto Protocol.
284920	289920	Compared to the early 1990s I was struck by how a lot of attitudes had changed.
289920	301920	Most of the skeptics had become convinced by the increasing weight of evidence, and the majority opinion was that climate change was real, and that man-made carbon gases played a crucial role.
301920	311920	Then in 2005 scientists in California reanalysed the 1992 data that showed cooling in the lower troposphere, and they found a crucial error.
311920	316920	The orbit of the satellite taking the temperature readings had degraded.
316920	324920	It had started life taking temperatures over the equator at two o'clock in the afternoon, but by the late 1990s it was taking the readings at five o'clock.
324920	330920	Hardly surprising, then, that the satellite had been recording a decrease in temperature over the years.
330920	335920	The discovery knocked out the final piece of evidence that contradicted global warming.
335920	338920	The computer models had been right all along.
338920	345920	At last the models of how the climate should be performing with increased carbon dioxide matched how it was performing.
345920	354920	Even most skeptics now accepted that the earth was warming, but that didn't necessarily mean that the warming was caused by man-made carbon gases.
354920	362920	And just as the lower troposphere anomaly was resolved, another argument arose, the 800-year carbon dioxide lag time.
362920	369920	At the Vostok station in Antarctica, an ice core was drilled looking back 420,000 years in time.
369920	373920	You can see an explanation of how this works in my video The Ice Age.
373920	379920	Climatologists were able to measure both the temperature and the carbon dioxide content of the atmosphere.
379920	388920	In his film An Inconvenient Truth, Al Gore used a graph like this to show a correlation between carbon dioxide levels and increased temperatures.
388920	395920	But he obscured the fact that the carbon dioxide increases lag the temperature increases by 800 years.
395920	402920	If carbon dioxide is supposed to cause global warming, as Gore claims, the lag time would suggest it's the other way round.
402920	408920	Well, yes, and yes, let's look at the science, not the hype.
408920	416920	In my video The Ice Age, I said there was a trigger that set off a vicious circle of events, each tipping the earth into a cooling or a warming phase.
416920	424920	In scientific terms, the vicious circle is called positive feedback, and it's best explained by looking at some weights on a balanced plank.
424920	432920	If the weights are equidistant from the pivot point, the plank is in balance. A slight offset will tilt the plank, but it won't upset the balance.
432920	439920	But let's say one of the weights is round and is moved half an inch. This causes the plank to tilt slightly.
439920	449920	But the tilt causes the weight to roll a bit, and the shift in position causes the plank to tilt a bit more, until soon there's a runaway event and the plank comes crashing to the ground.
449920	463920	We know that similar positive feedback happened during the Ice Ages. Each cooling and warming phase is amplified, so that a tiny bit of cooling ends up freezing half the planet, and a tiny bit of warming ends up thawing it out again.
463920	471920	But each time something had to act as that initial trigger. Something had to nudge the round weight just a fraction.
471920	479920	A strong contender has always been regular cyclical deviation in the earth's position or orbit, changing the amount of sunlight the earth received.
479920	489920	Whatever it was, in the depths of the Ice Age this change melted a tiny part of the ice sheet and released carbon gases from the soil and from the warmer oceans.
489920	498920	The carbon gases that were released trapped more long-wave radiation and warmed the planet a bit more, and that released more carbon gases, and so on.
498920	509920	Climate change proponents have never suggested that a carbon dioxide increase was the trigger for past warming, only that the trigger released carbon gases, which set off this vicious circle of heating.
509920	516920	So the lag time shown in the Vostok ice core isn't disputed, and the reasons for it are part of the global warming model.
516920	521920	But without a trigger, this positive feedback wouldn't even begin.
521920	527920	So if the trigger was a cyclical variation in the earth's position, then we don't have anything to worry about, right?
527920	534920	Because, as we saw in the video The Ice Age, the earth's orbit will remain steady for another 16,000 years.
534920	540920	The problem is, anything that causes a tiny increase in temperature can trigger this vicious circle.
540920	547920	And the premise of the climate change proponents is that our industrial output of carbon dioxide itself is now the trigger.
547920	564920	They calculate that the dramatic rise we've seen in carbon dioxide levels over the last hundred years will increase temperatures just enough to trigger a positive feedback loop that will result in more greenhouse gases, causing more warming, causing the release of more greenhouse gases, and so on.
564920	574920	This is already being seen. For example, in Siberia, melting ice is thawing out millions of square miles of marsh, producing tons of methane gas.
574920	580920	Methane is a more potent greenhouse gas than carbon dioxide, but it's much less abundant in the atmosphere.
580920	589920	Even so, the methane which goes into the atmosphere adds to global warming, creating more marshland, which releases more methane.
589920	598920	The 800-year lag time may be a wonderful debating point in the ideological war, but it barely touches the real discussion going on among climate scientists.
598920	607920	So what is the debate going on in that field? To say that there's no debate is nonsense. There's always a debate about every scientific issue.
607920	621920	But to claim there's no consensus is equally false. There are many ways to measure the views of climate scientists, and as we'll see in a later video, it's clear that the overwhelming majority accept the role of man-made gases in global warming.
621920	627920	But however unequal the debate might be, there are still dissenting views of qualified skeptics.
627920	637920	In the next video, I want to look at some scientific papers that suggest two alternative hypotheses on climate change, neither of which has anything to do with carbon gases.
