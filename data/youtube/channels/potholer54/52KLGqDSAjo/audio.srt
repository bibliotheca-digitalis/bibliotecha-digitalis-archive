1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,960
No, I'm not going to give you the latest pronouncements from Al Gore on the subject of climate change.

2
00:00:07,960 --> 00:00:12,460
Al's not a scientist, let alone a geologist or a climatologist.

3
00:00:12,460 --> 00:00:13,920
And neither are these guys.

4
00:00:13,920 --> 00:00:20,000
However well-meaning they may be, most environmental activists don't know a schist from Shinola.

5
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:24,700
And the same goes for climate prognosticators like Rush Limbaugh and Paul Harvey.

6
00:00:24,700 --> 00:00:29,820
This video is about science, and the debate between climate scientists.

7
00:00:29,820 --> 00:00:34,820
I'm not going to descend into political jargon by talking about climate change believers,

8
00:00:34,820 --> 00:00:38,820
as if the issue depends on faith rather than a strong body of evidence.

9
00:00:38,820 --> 00:00:41,820
And I'm not going to talk about climate change deniers,

10
00:00:41,820 --> 00:00:47,480
as if there's an absolute and unassailable truth that they're deliberately refusing to see.

11
00:00:47,480 --> 00:00:53,780
No, there are climate scientists who are proponents of the idea that climate change is being driven by man-made causes,

12
00:00:53,780 --> 00:00:56,920
and there are climate scientists who are skeptics.

13
00:00:56,920 --> 00:01:00,920
So let's start by looking at how we got to the current state of debate.

14
00:01:00,920 --> 00:01:06,920
Our atmosphere is composed mainly of nitrogen gas, a lot of oxygen, and then smaller amounts of other gases,

15
00:01:06,920 --> 00:01:09,920
like water vapour, carbon dioxide and methane.

16
00:01:09,920 --> 00:01:15,920
Most radiation from the sun passes right through these gases because it has a short wavelength.

17
00:01:15,920 --> 00:01:20,920
The radiation heats up the ground and is re-emitted as long-wavelength radiation,

18
00:01:20,920 --> 00:01:25,920
the kind of infrared heat you feel from a hot electric stove or a warm sidewalk.

19
00:01:25,920 --> 00:01:32,920
But although water vapour, carbon dioxide and methane molecules allowed most of this short-wave radiation to pass right through them,

20
00:01:32,920 --> 00:01:35,920
they absorb the long-wave radiation.

21
00:01:35,920 --> 00:01:39,920
This causes them to vibrate, and of course vibration is heat.

22
00:01:39,920 --> 00:01:42,920
They radiate this heat through the atmosphere.

23
00:01:42,920 --> 00:01:45,920
This is the so-called greenhouse effect.

24
00:01:45,920 --> 00:01:49,920
But in fact the physics is quite different to a greenhouse, so I dislike the term.

25
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:54,920
Of the three so-called greenhouse gases, two of them are being produced by human activity,

26
00:01:54,920 --> 00:01:58,920
so it would be more accurate to describe these as carbon gases.

27
00:01:58,920 --> 00:02:04,920
If none of these three gases was there, the long-wave radiation from the ground would simply radiate into space.

28
00:02:04,920 --> 00:02:08,920
The earth would be a frigid planet, as cold as the moon.

29
00:02:08,920 --> 00:02:13,920
So of course the opposite is true, that if these gases were abundant in the atmosphere,

30
00:02:13,920 --> 00:02:18,920
most of the long-wave radiation would be trapped and the earth would heat up like a sauna.

31
00:02:18,920 --> 00:02:23,920
Proponents and skeptics all agree on this because it is well-established basic physics.

32
00:02:23,920 --> 00:02:29,920
Long-wave radiation absorption by carbon dioxide was first discovered over 150 years ago.

33
00:02:29,920 --> 00:02:34,920
A hundred years ago the Swedish scientist Svante Arrhenius suggested that theoretically,

34
00:02:34,920 --> 00:02:40,920
if carbon dioxide levels were to increase drastically in the atmosphere, the world would heat up.

35
00:02:40,920 --> 00:02:46,920
In an age of horse-drawn carriages the idea was interesting, but not something to worry about.

36
00:02:46,920 --> 00:02:52,920
But by the 1950s there was enough concern to begin the world's first monitoring of carbon dioxide levels.

37
00:02:52,920 --> 00:02:59,920
And in the 1970s studies conducted by the US Department of Energy showed that increasing industrialisation

38
00:02:59,920 --> 00:03:03,920
could very soon produce what's become known as the greenhouse effect.

39
00:03:03,920 --> 00:03:08,920
The emphasis is on the word could, because there were two schools of thought.

40
00:03:08,920 --> 00:03:13,920
One possibility was that tiny droplets of pollution in the atmosphere, so-called aerosols,

41
00:03:13,920 --> 00:03:21,920
would reflect the sun's radiation back into space and that would tend to overcome any warming effect from increased carbon dioxide.

42
00:03:21,920 --> 00:03:28,920
It could even cause the earth to cool down, sparking another ice age. This became known as global dimming.

43
00:03:28,920 --> 00:03:37,920
The other possibility was that the build-up of carbon dioxide would be so great that global warming would overcome any cooling caused by reflective aerosols.

44
00:03:37,920 --> 00:03:45,920
By the 1980s the contest between global warming and global dimming was pretty much settled by temperature readings on the ground.

45
00:03:45,920 --> 00:03:52,920
The earth wasn't getting cooler, it was getting hotter, and the 1980s turned out to be the hottest decade on record.

46
00:03:52,920 --> 00:03:56,920
By the way, we'll look at some of the flaws in temperature reading in a later video.

47
00:03:56,920 --> 00:04:02,920
I began reporting on this issue in 1992 when new data threw a curveball.

48
00:04:02,920 --> 00:04:10,920
Crucially, although temperatures on the earth's surface were rising, satellite measurements of temperatures in the lower troposphere showed a distinct cooling.

49
00:04:10,920 --> 00:04:18,920
All the computer models showed that the earth should be warming in the lower troposphere, and since it was cooling the models had to be wrong.

50
00:04:18,920 --> 00:04:22,920
But all the other evidence for a warming earth was clear and compelling.

51
00:04:22,920 --> 00:04:29,920
Ice was rapidly melting in Greenland, glaciers were retreating, and Antarctic ice sheets were breaking away.

52
00:04:29,920 --> 00:04:36,920
By 1997 there was more than enough evidence for the world to take concerted action, or at least try to.

53
00:04:36,920 --> 00:04:44,920
That year I was sent to Kyoto to cover the Framework Convention on Climate Change, which resulted in what became known as the Kyoto Protocol.

54
00:04:44,920 --> 00:04:49,920
Compared to the early 1990s I was struck by how a lot of attitudes had changed.

55
00:04:49,920 --> 00:05:01,920
Most of the skeptics had become convinced by the increasing weight of evidence, and the majority opinion was that climate change was real, and that man-made carbon gases played a crucial role.

56
00:05:01,920 --> 00:05:11,920
Then in 2005 scientists in California reanalysed the 1992 data that showed cooling in the lower troposphere, and they found a crucial error.

57
00:05:11,920 --> 00:05:16,920
The orbit of the satellite taking the temperature readings had degraded.

58
00:05:16,920 --> 00:05:24,920
It had started life taking temperatures over the equator at two o'clock in the afternoon, but by the late 1990s it was taking the readings at five o'clock.

59
00:05:24,920 --> 00:05:30,920
Hardly surprising, then, that the satellite had been recording a decrease in temperature over the years.

60
00:05:30,920 --> 00:05:35,920
The discovery knocked out the final piece of evidence that contradicted global warming.

61
00:05:35,920 --> 00:05:38,920
The computer models had been right all along.

62
00:05:38,920 --> 00:05:45,920
At last the models of how the climate should be performing with increased carbon dioxide matched how it was performing.

63
00:05:45,920 --> 00:05:54,920
Even most skeptics now accepted that the earth was warming, but that didn't necessarily mean that the warming was caused by man-made carbon gases.

64
00:05:54,920 --> 00:06:02,920
And just as the lower troposphere anomaly was resolved, another argument arose, the 800-year carbon dioxide lag time.

65
00:06:02,920 --> 00:06:09,920
At the Vostok station in Antarctica, an ice core was drilled looking back 420,000 years in time.

66
00:06:09,920 --> 00:06:13,920
You can see an explanation of how this works in my video The Ice Age.

67
00:06:13,920 --> 00:06:19,920
Climatologists were able to measure both the temperature and the carbon dioxide content of the atmosphere.

68
00:06:19,920 --> 00:06:28,920
In his film An Inconvenient Truth, Al Gore used a graph like this to show a correlation between carbon dioxide levels and increased temperatures.

69
00:06:28,920 --> 00:06:35,920
But he obscured the fact that the carbon dioxide increases lag the temperature increases by 800 years.

70
00:06:35,920 --> 00:06:42,920
If carbon dioxide is supposed to cause global warming, as Gore claims, the lag time would suggest it's the other way round.

71
00:06:42,920 --> 00:06:48,920
Well, yes, and yes, let's look at the science, not the hype.

72
00:06:48,920 --> 00:06:56,920
In my video The Ice Age, I said there was a trigger that set off a vicious circle of events, each tipping the earth into a cooling or a warming phase.

73
00:06:56,920 --> 00:07:04,920
In scientific terms, the vicious circle is called positive feedback, and it's best explained by looking at some weights on a balanced plank.

74
00:07:04,920 --> 00:07:12,920
If the weights are equidistant from the pivot point, the plank is in balance. A slight offset will tilt the plank, but it won't upset the balance.

75
00:07:12,920 --> 00:07:19,920
But let's say one of the weights is round and is moved half an inch. This causes the plank to tilt slightly.

76
00:07:19,920 --> 00:07:29,920
But the tilt causes the weight to roll a bit, and the shift in position causes the plank to tilt a bit more, until soon there's a runaway event and the plank comes crashing to the ground.

77
00:07:29,920 --> 00:07:43,920
We know that similar positive feedback happened during the Ice Ages. Each cooling and warming phase is amplified, so that a tiny bit of cooling ends up freezing half the planet, and a tiny bit of warming ends up thawing it out again.

78
00:07:43,920 --> 00:07:51,920
But each time something had to act as that initial trigger. Something had to nudge the round weight just a fraction.

79
00:07:51,920 --> 00:07:59,920
A strong contender has always been regular cyclical deviation in the earth's position or orbit, changing the amount of sunlight the earth received.

80
00:07:59,920 --> 00:08:09,920
Whatever it was, in the depths of the Ice Age this change melted a tiny part of the ice sheet and released carbon gases from the soil and from the warmer oceans.

81
00:08:09,920 --> 00:08:18,920
The carbon gases that were released trapped more long-wave radiation and warmed the planet a bit more, and that released more carbon gases, and so on.

82
00:08:18,920 --> 00:08:29,920
Climate change proponents have never suggested that a carbon dioxide increase was the trigger for past warming, only that the trigger released carbon gases, which set off this vicious circle of heating.

83
00:08:29,920 --> 00:08:36,920
So the lag time shown in the Vostok ice core isn't disputed, and the reasons for it are part of the global warming model.

84
00:08:36,920 --> 00:08:41,920
But without a trigger, this positive feedback wouldn't even begin.

85
00:08:41,920 --> 00:08:47,920
So if the trigger was a cyclical variation in the earth's position, then we don't have anything to worry about, right?

86
00:08:47,920 --> 00:08:54,920
Because, as we saw in the video The Ice Age, the earth's orbit will remain steady for another 16,000 years.

87
00:08:54,920 --> 00:09:00,920
The problem is, anything that causes a tiny increase in temperature can trigger this vicious circle.

88
00:09:00,920 --> 00:09:07,920
And the premise of the climate change proponents is that our industrial output of carbon dioxide itself is now the trigger.

89
00:09:07,920 --> 00:09:24,920
They calculate that the dramatic rise we've seen in carbon dioxide levels over the last hundred years will increase temperatures just enough to trigger a positive feedback loop that will result in more greenhouse gases, causing more warming, causing the release of more greenhouse gases, and so on.

90
00:09:24,920 --> 00:09:34,920
This is already being seen. For example, in Siberia, melting ice is thawing out millions of square miles of marsh, producing tons of methane gas.

91
00:09:34,920 --> 00:09:40,920
Methane is a more potent greenhouse gas than carbon dioxide, but it's much less abundant in the atmosphere.

92
00:09:40,920 --> 00:09:49,920
Even so, the methane which goes into the atmosphere adds to global warming, creating more marshland, which releases more methane.

93
00:09:49,920 --> 00:09:58,920
The 800-year lag time may be a wonderful debating point in the ideological war, but it barely touches the real discussion going on among climate scientists.

94
00:09:58,920 --> 00:10:07,920
So what is the debate going on in that field? To say that there's no debate is nonsense. There's always a debate about every scientific issue.

95
00:10:07,920 --> 00:10:21,920
But to claim there's no consensus is equally false. There are many ways to measure the views of climate scientists, and as we'll see in a later video, it's clear that the overwhelming majority accept the role of man-made gases in global warming.

96
00:10:21,920 --> 00:10:27,920
But however unequal the debate might be, there are still dissenting views of qualified skeptics.

97
00:10:27,920 --> 00:10:37,920
In the next video, I want to look at some scientific papers that suggest two alternative hypotheses on climate change, neither of which has anything to do with carbon gases.
