00:00.000 --> 00:10.000
Previous videos showed how the earth's sedimentary rocks are like the pages of a book, taking

00:10.000 --> 00:11.840
us back through time.

00:11.840 --> 00:16.480
Nineteenth century geologists discovered that the lowest and oldest layers contained a small

00:16.480 --> 00:19.640
variety of very primitive marine species.

00:19.640 --> 00:23.900
Higher sedimentary layers held more varied and more complex creatures.

00:23.900 --> 00:28.280
The progression suggested that these animals didn't appear suddenly but were gradually

00:28.280 --> 00:29.880
evolving.

00:29.880 --> 00:32.320
But there were sudden disappearances.

00:32.320 --> 00:38.840
This layer of rock, for example, marks a catastrophic mass extinction about 250 million years ago.

00:38.840 --> 00:43.440
The rocks below this line are full of marine fossils but in the rocks above they're all

00:43.440 --> 00:44.700
gone.

00:44.700 --> 00:49.640
There were five global mass extinctions we know of, each one wiping out between 50 and

00:49.640 --> 00:52.200
95% of species.

00:52.200 --> 00:57.480
Each was followed by the gradual recolonization of the earth by surviving organisms that again

00:57.480 --> 01:02.640
began to change and become more complex until the next mass extinction.

01:02.640 --> 01:07.300
If this increasing complexity really did mean some kind of evolution, we'd expect to see

01:07.300 --> 01:12.600
it in individual species as we track their fossils through millions of years of sedimentary

01:12.600 --> 01:13.600
rock.

01:13.600 --> 01:14.600
And we do.

01:14.600 --> 01:18.840
Either each species is suddenly being killed off, only to be replaced by the sudden appearance

01:18.840 --> 01:23.460
of something that's almost identical, or we're seeing the changing morphology of a single

01:23.460 --> 01:25.520
species through time.

01:25.520 --> 01:30.760
We also expect to see traces of an animal's evolutionary ancestry in its morphology today,

01:30.760 --> 01:32.040
and we do.

01:32.040 --> 01:34.520
Take a look at this skeleton of an ape's hand.

01:34.520 --> 01:38.000
It looks just like a human hand, except it's not.

01:38.000 --> 01:40.600
In fact, it's not an ape's hand either.

01:40.600 --> 01:45.560
It's a whale's hand, or at least what used to be a hand in its ancestral past and is

01:45.560 --> 01:47.480
now used as a flipper.

01:47.480 --> 01:51.880
The morphology of animals today is full of remnant body parts that have been changed

01:51.880 --> 01:55.360
and adapted, just as evolution predicts.

01:55.360 --> 01:59.580
In a video on natural selection, I showed how a hypothetical animal might evolve into

01:59.580 --> 02:01.420
two different species.

02:01.420 --> 02:06.520
At first the two types would be able to reproduce, then reproduce with difficulty, and then not

02:06.520 --> 02:08.360
reproduce at all.

02:08.360 --> 02:13.300
We can't watch it happening in mammals today because it takes several thousand generations,

02:13.300 --> 02:17.040
but we can see snapshots of it frozen in time.

02:17.040 --> 02:21.300
Modern horses, for example, separated from zebras several million years ago.

02:21.300 --> 02:27.080
They can still reproduce, but with difficulty, because a horse's DNA has 64 chromosomes

02:27.080 --> 02:29.260
and a zebra's 44.

02:29.260 --> 02:34.060
When an offspring is produced, it's sterile, exactly what evolution would predict.

02:34.060 --> 02:40.100
An even better example is found around mountains, where a species evolves as it spreads geographically.

02:40.100 --> 02:44.260
Each species can interbreed with the one next to it, but the species at each end of the

02:44.260 --> 02:47.380
line can't interbreed with each other.

02:47.380 --> 02:52.380
With organisms with very fast reproduction rates, such as bacteria and flies, separation

02:52.380 --> 02:55.860
into new species has indeed been seen.

02:55.860 --> 02:59.460
This for example is a flavobacterium that eats nylon.

02:59.460 --> 03:04.100
It was found in a waste outlet near a Japanese factory that produces the stuff.

03:04.100 --> 03:09.860
The problem is nylon was only invented in 1935 and is completely synthetic and undigestible

03:09.860 --> 03:12.340
to other bacteria.

03:12.340 --> 03:17.220
Does this fit perfectly with evolution, and they evolve because of a mutation some time

03:17.220 --> 03:22.120
between the invention of nylon and their discovery 40 years later?

03:22.120 --> 03:27.140
The answer came when researchers kept a completely different bacterium in a similar nylon-rich

03:27.140 --> 03:30.500
environment and the same mutation occurred.

03:30.500 --> 03:36.340
DNA research has only added to the overwhelming evidence of evolution, but it's also completely

03:36.340 --> 03:41.360
shaken up the evolutionary tree and shown in much greater detail which animals share

03:41.360 --> 03:45.420
a common ancestor and when they separated.

03:45.420 --> 03:50.460
Ancestors are now manipulating DNA to discover a treasure trove of evolutionary information.

03:50.460 --> 03:55.220
It's long been known that ancestral traits buried deep inside DNA can get switched on

03:55.220 --> 04:00.600
by accident with very obvious results, but they can also now be deliberately switched

04:00.600 --> 04:02.580
on in research labs.

04:02.580 --> 04:07.280
Chickens for example don't have teeth, but their distant ancestors did and the code for

04:07.280 --> 04:09.700
it is still buried in their DNA.

04:09.700 --> 04:13.620
Activate the right gene and you get a chicken with teeth.

04:13.620 --> 04:17.560
One of the commonest misconceptions about evolution is that we never find a transitional

04:17.560 --> 04:20.560
form between one species and another.

04:20.560 --> 04:25.180
But the fossil record is full of animals changing from one kind into another.

04:25.180 --> 04:28.400
It's one of the reasons we know evolution happened.

04:28.400 --> 04:32.940
Every animal is a transition between what went before and what comes after.

04:32.940 --> 04:38.220
If you think we haven't captured the instantaneous moment that one species turns into another,

04:38.220 --> 04:40.540
that's because there isn't one.

04:40.540 --> 04:45.220
It's like asking where's the intermediate form between this and this?

04:45.220 --> 04:49.580
We know that this species existed at one time and is now gone and it seems to have been

04:49.580 --> 04:51.500
replaced by this species.

04:51.500 --> 04:57.020
We can scour the archives and dig up as many transitional photos of George Bush as we like,

04:57.020 --> 05:02.420
but we're never going to find a single shot of Dubya changing from a baby into a man.

05:02.420 --> 05:06.500
What we will find are the various transitional forms in between.

05:06.500 --> 05:10.900
If you're talking about gaps in the record, sure, there are lots of them.

05:10.900 --> 05:15.260
This is all I could find when I googled images from the life of George Bush, so of course

05:15.260 --> 05:16.640
there are gaps.

05:16.640 --> 05:20.780
If I went on a digging expedition I could probably find a hundred more, but even if

05:20.780 --> 05:25.840
I had a thousand chronologically spaced photos of George Bush, there would still be gaps

05:25.840 --> 05:27.220
in between.

05:27.220 --> 05:31.900
As I mentioned in the last video, we now know that evolution, just like the growth of George

05:31.900 --> 05:34.460
Bush, doesn't happen evenly.

05:34.460 --> 05:39.580
The few years in between this photo and this one mark very few changes, but there's been

05:39.580 --> 05:44.180
a huge change in the same period of time between this photo and this one.

05:44.180 --> 05:48.460
But even when evolution happens quickly it's still not instantaneous.

05:48.460 --> 05:53.460
For some animals we've got a very good fossil record and the time gaps between fossils are

05:53.460 --> 05:54.460
small.

05:54.460 --> 05:56.180
This shows evolution very clearly.

05:56.180 --> 06:00.580
For other animals the gaps are longer and the record is far less complete.

06:00.580 --> 06:03.940
Yes, I get that a lot.

06:03.940 --> 06:08.300
A theory in scientific nomenclature is the highest form of proof you can get.

06:08.300 --> 06:11.660
To go any higher you have to enter the realm of mathematics.

06:11.660 --> 06:16.260
In all the sciences there's still a lot more to discover, a lot more to understand and

06:16.260 --> 06:21.260
a lot more to explain, whether it's atomic theory, the theory of gravity or the theory

06:21.260 --> 06:22.660
of evolution.

06:22.660 --> 06:27.260
These are all called theories, so if you don't understand what a theory is in scientific

06:27.260 --> 06:30.560
terms then they're what you would call facts.

06:30.560 --> 06:34.000
And using common terminology evolution is a fact.

06:34.000 --> 06:39.280
It's so much a fact that researchers now depend on evolutionary theory to study antibiotic

06:39.280 --> 06:44.840
resistance and crop pests and new diseases and to develop new drugs.

06:44.840 --> 06:49.560
Understanding evolution isn't just important for understanding our past, but our future.
