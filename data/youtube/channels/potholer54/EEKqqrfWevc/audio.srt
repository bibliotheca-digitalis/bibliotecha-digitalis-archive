00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,000
Previous videos showed how the earth's sedimentary rocks are like the pages of a book, taking

2
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:11,840
us back through time.

3
00:00:11,840 --> 00:00:16,480
Nineteenth century geologists discovered that the lowest and oldest layers contained a small

4
00:00:16,480 --> 00:00:19,640
variety of very primitive marine species.

5
00:00:19,640 --> 00:00:23,900
Higher sedimentary layers held more varied and more complex creatures.

6
00:00:23,900 --> 00:00:28,280
The progression suggested that these animals didn't appear suddenly but were gradually

7
00:00:28,280 --> 00:00:29,880
evolving.

8
00:00:29,880 --> 00:00:32,320
But there were sudden disappearances.

9
00:00:32,320 --> 00:00:38,840
This layer of rock, for example, marks a catastrophic mass extinction about 250 million years ago.

10
00:00:38,840 --> 00:00:43,440
The rocks below this line are full of marine fossils but in the rocks above they're all

11
00:00:43,440 --> 00:00:44,700
gone.

12
00:00:44,700 --> 00:00:49,640
There were five global mass extinctions we know of, each one wiping out between 50 and

13
00:00:49,640 --> 00:00:52,200
95% of species.

14
00:00:52,200 --> 00:00:57,480
Each was followed by the gradual recolonization of the earth by surviving organisms that again

15
00:00:57,480 --> 00:01:02,640
began to change and become more complex until the next mass extinction.

16
00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:07,300
If this increasing complexity really did mean some kind of evolution, we'd expect to see

17
00:01:07,300 --> 00:01:12,600
it in individual species as we track their fossils through millions of years of sedimentary

18
00:01:12,600 --> 00:01:13,600
rock.

19
00:01:13,600 --> 00:01:14,600
And we do.

20
00:01:14,600 --> 00:01:18,840
Either each species is suddenly being killed off, only to be replaced by the sudden appearance

21
00:01:18,840 --> 00:01:23,460
of something that's almost identical, or we're seeing the changing morphology of a single

22
00:01:23,460 --> 00:01:25,520
species through time.

23
00:01:25,520 --> 00:01:30,760
We also expect to see traces of an animal's evolutionary ancestry in its morphology today,

24
00:01:30,760 --> 00:01:32,040
and we do.

25
00:01:32,040 --> 00:01:34,520
Take a look at this skeleton of an ape's hand.

26
00:01:34,520 --> 00:01:38,000
It looks just like a human hand, except it's not.

27
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:40,600
In fact, it's not an ape's hand either.

28
00:01:40,600 --> 00:01:45,560
It's a whale's hand, or at least what used to be a hand in its ancestral past and is

29
00:01:45,560 --> 00:01:47,480
now used as a flipper.

30
00:01:47,480 --> 00:01:51,880
The morphology of animals today is full of remnant body parts that have been changed

31
00:01:51,880 --> 00:01:55,360
and adapted, just as evolution predicts.

32
00:01:55,360 --> 00:01:59,580
In a video on natural selection, I showed how a hypothetical animal might evolve into

33
00:01:59,580 --> 00:02:01,420
two different species.

34
00:02:01,420 --> 00:02:06,520
At first the two types would be able to reproduce, then reproduce with difficulty, and then not

35
00:02:06,520 --> 00:02:08,360
reproduce at all.

36
00:02:08,360 --> 00:02:13,300
We can't watch it happening in mammals today because it takes several thousand generations,

37
00:02:13,300 --> 00:02:17,040
but we can see snapshots of it frozen in time.

38
00:02:17,040 --> 00:02:21,300
Modern horses, for example, separated from zebras several million years ago.

39
00:02:21,300 --> 00:02:27,080
They can still reproduce, but with difficulty, because a horse's DNA has 64 chromosomes

40
00:02:27,080 --> 00:02:29,260
and a zebra's 44.

41
00:02:29,260 --> 00:02:34,060
When an offspring is produced, it's sterile, exactly what evolution would predict.

42
00:02:34,060 --> 00:02:40,100
An even better example is found around mountains, where a species evolves as it spreads geographically.

43
00:02:40,100 --> 00:02:44,260
Each species can interbreed with the one next to it, but the species at each end of the

44
00:02:44,260 --> 00:02:47,380
line can't interbreed with each other.

45
00:02:47,380 --> 00:02:52,380
With organisms with very fast reproduction rates, such as bacteria and flies, separation

46
00:02:52,380 --> 00:02:55,860
into new species has indeed been seen.

47
00:02:55,860 --> 00:02:59,460
This for example is a flavobacterium that eats nylon.

48
00:02:59,460 --> 00:03:04,100
It was found in a waste outlet near a Japanese factory that produces the stuff.

49
00:03:04,100 --> 00:03:09,860
The problem is nylon was only invented in 1935 and is completely synthetic and undigestible

50
00:03:09,860 --> 00:03:12,340
to other bacteria.

51
00:03:12,340 --> 00:03:17,220
Does this fit perfectly with evolution, and they evolve because of a mutation some time

52
00:03:17,220 --> 00:03:22,120
between the invention of nylon and their discovery 40 years later?

53
00:03:22,120 --> 00:03:27,140
The answer came when researchers kept a completely different bacterium in a similar nylon-rich

54
00:03:27,140 --> 00:03:30,500
environment and the same mutation occurred.

55
00:03:30,500 --> 00:03:36,340
DNA research has only added to the overwhelming evidence of evolution, but it's also completely

56
00:03:36,340 --> 00:03:41,360
shaken up the evolutionary tree and shown in much greater detail which animals share

57
00:03:41,360 --> 00:03:45,420
a common ancestor and when they separated.

58
00:03:45,420 --> 00:03:50,460
Ancestors are now manipulating DNA to discover a treasure trove of evolutionary information.

59
00:03:50,460 --> 00:03:55,220
It's long been known that ancestral traits buried deep inside DNA can get switched on

60
00:03:55,220 --> 00:04:00,600
by accident with very obvious results, but they can also now be deliberately switched

61
00:04:00,600 --> 00:04:02,580
on in research labs.

62
00:04:02,580 --> 00:04:07,280
Chickens for example don't have teeth, but their distant ancestors did and the code for

63
00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:09,700
it is still buried in their DNA.

64
00:04:09,700 --> 00:04:13,620
Activate the right gene and you get a chicken with teeth.

65
00:04:13,620 --> 00:04:17,560
One of the commonest misconceptions about evolution is that we never find a transitional

66
00:04:17,560 --> 00:04:20,560
form between one species and another.

67
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:25,180
But the fossil record is full of animals changing from one kind into another.

68
00:04:25,180 --> 00:04:28,400
It's one of the reasons we know evolution happened.

69
00:04:28,400 --> 00:04:32,940
Every animal is a transition between what went before and what comes after.

70
00:04:32,940 --> 00:04:38,220
If you think we haven't captured the instantaneous moment that one species turns into another,

71
00:04:38,220 --> 00:04:40,540
that's because there isn't one.

72
00:04:40,540 --> 00:04:45,220
It's like asking where's the intermediate form between this and this?

73
00:04:45,220 --> 00:04:49,580
We know that this species existed at one time and is now gone and it seems to have been

74
00:04:49,580 --> 00:04:51,500
replaced by this species.

75
00:04:51,500 --> 00:04:57,020
We can scour the archives and dig up as many transitional photos of George Bush as we like,

76
00:04:57,020 --> 00:05:02,420
but we're never going to find a single shot of Dubya changing from a baby into a man.

77
00:05:02,420 --> 00:05:06,500
What we will find are the various transitional forms in between.

78
00:05:06,500 --> 00:05:10,900
If you're talking about gaps in the record, sure, there are lots of them.

79
00:05:10,900 --> 00:05:15,260
This is all I could find when I googled images from the life of George Bush, so of course

80
00:05:15,260 --> 00:05:16,640
there are gaps.

81
00:05:16,640 --> 00:05:20,780
If I went on a digging expedition I could probably find a hundred more, but even if

82
00:05:20,780 --> 00:05:25,840
I had a thousand chronologically spaced photos of George Bush, there would still be gaps

83
00:05:25,840 --> 00:05:27,220
in between.

84
00:05:27,220 --> 00:05:31,900
As I mentioned in the last video, we now know that evolution, just like the growth of George

85
00:05:31,900 --> 00:05:34,460
Bush, doesn't happen evenly.

86
00:05:34,460 --> 00:05:39,580
The few years in between this photo and this one mark very few changes, but there's been

87
00:05:39,580 --> 00:05:44,180
a huge change in the same period of time between this photo and this one.

88
00:05:44,180 --> 00:05:48,460
But even when evolution happens quickly it's still not instantaneous.

89
00:05:48,460 --> 00:05:53,460
For some animals we've got a very good fossil record and the time gaps between fossils are

90
00:05:53,460 --> 00:05:54,460
small.

91
00:05:54,460 --> 00:05:56,180
This shows evolution very clearly.

92
00:05:56,180 --> 00:06:00,580
For other animals the gaps are longer and the record is far less complete.

93
00:06:00,580 --> 00:06:03,940
Yes, I get that a lot.

94
00:06:03,940 --> 00:06:08,300
A theory in scientific nomenclature is the highest form of proof you can get.

95
00:06:08,300 --> 00:06:11,660
To go any higher you have to enter the realm of mathematics.

96
00:06:11,660 --> 00:06:16,260
In all the sciences there's still a lot more to discover, a lot more to understand and

97
00:06:16,260 --> 00:06:21,260
a lot more to explain, whether it's atomic theory, the theory of gravity or the theory

98
00:06:21,260 --> 00:06:22,660
of evolution.

99
00:06:22,660 --> 00:06:27,260
These are all called theories, so if you don't understand what a theory is in scientific

100
00:06:27,260 --> 00:06:30,560
terms then they're what you would call facts.

101
00:06:30,560 --> 00:06:34,000
And using common terminology evolution is a fact.

102
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:39,280
It's so much a fact that researchers now depend on evolutionary theory to study antibiotic

103
00:06:39,280 --> 00:06:44,840
resistance and crop pests and new diseases and to develop new drugs.

104
00:06:44,840 --> 00:06:49,560
Understanding evolution isn't just important for understanding our past, but our future.
