0	10000	Previous videos showed how the earth's sedimentary rocks are like the pages of a book, taking
10000	11840	us back through time.
11840	16480	Nineteenth century geologists discovered that the lowest and oldest layers contained a small
16480	19640	variety of very primitive marine species.
19640	23900	Higher sedimentary layers held more varied and more complex creatures.
23900	28280	The progression suggested that these animals didn't appear suddenly but were gradually
28280	29880	evolving.
29880	32320	But there were sudden disappearances.
32320	38840	This layer of rock, for example, marks a catastrophic mass extinction about 250 million years ago.
38840	43440	The rocks below this line are full of marine fossils but in the rocks above they're all
43440	44700	gone.
44700	49640	There were five global mass extinctions we know of, each one wiping out between 50 and
49640	52200	95% of species.
52200	57480	Each was followed by the gradual recolonization of the earth by surviving organisms that again
57480	62640	began to change and become more complex until the next mass extinction.
62640	67300	If this increasing complexity really did mean some kind of evolution, we'd expect to see
67300	72600	it in individual species as we track their fossils through millions of years of sedimentary
72600	73600	rock.
73600	74600	And we do.
74600	78840	Either each species is suddenly being killed off, only to be replaced by the sudden appearance
78840	83460	of something that's almost identical, or we're seeing the changing morphology of a single
83460	85520	species through time.
85520	90760	We also expect to see traces of an animal's evolutionary ancestry in its morphology today,
90760	92040	and we do.
92040	94520	Take a look at this skeleton of an ape's hand.
94520	98000	It looks just like a human hand, except it's not.
98000	100600	In fact, it's not an ape's hand either.
100600	105560	It's a whale's hand, or at least what used to be a hand in its ancestral past and is
105560	107480	now used as a flipper.
107480	111880	The morphology of animals today is full of remnant body parts that have been changed
111880	115360	and adapted, just as evolution predicts.
115360	119580	In a video on natural selection, I showed how a hypothetical animal might evolve into
119580	121420	two different species.
121420	126520	At first the two types would be able to reproduce, then reproduce with difficulty, and then not
126520	128360	reproduce at all.
128360	133300	We can't watch it happening in mammals today because it takes several thousand generations,
133300	137040	but we can see snapshots of it frozen in time.
137040	141300	Modern horses, for example, separated from zebras several million years ago.
141300	147080	They can still reproduce, but with difficulty, because a horse's DNA has 64 chromosomes
147080	149260	and a zebra's 44.
149260	154060	When an offspring is produced, it's sterile, exactly what evolution would predict.
154060	160100	An even better example is found around mountains, where a species evolves as it spreads geographically.
160100	164260	Each species can interbreed with the one next to it, but the species at each end of the
164260	167380	line can't interbreed with each other.
167380	172380	With organisms with very fast reproduction rates, such as bacteria and flies, separation
172380	175860	into new species has indeed been seen.
175860	179460	This for example is a flavobacterium that eats nylon.
179460	184100	It was found in a waste outlet near a Japanese factory that produces the stuff.
184100	189860	The problem is nylon was only invented in 1935 and is completely synthetic and undigestible
189860	192340	to other bacteria.
192340	197220	Does this fit perfectly with evolution, and they evolve because of a mutation some time
197220	202120	between the invention of nylon and their discovery 40 years later?
202120	207140	The answer came when researchers kept a completely different bacterium in a similar nylon-rich
207140	210500	environment and the same mutation occurred.
210500	216340	DNA research has only added to the overwhelming evidence of evolution, but it's also completely
216340	221360	shaken up the evolutionary tree and shown in much greater detail which animals share
221360	225420	a common ancestor and when they separated.
225420	230460	Ancestors are now manipulating DNA to discover a treasure trove of evolutionary information.
230460	235220	It's long been known that ancestral traits buried deep inside DNA can get switched on
235220	240600	by accident with very obvious results, but they can also now be deliberately switched
240600	242580	on in research labs.
242580	247280	Chickens for example don't have teeth, but their distant ancestors did and the code for
247280	249700	it is still buried in their DNA.
249700	253620	Activate the right gene and you get a chicken with teeth.
253620	257560	One of the commonest misconceptions about evolution is that we never find a transitional
257560	260560	form between one species and another.
260560	265180	But the fossil record is full of animals changing from one kind into another.
265180	268400	It's one of the reasons we know evolution happened.
268400	272940	Every animal is a transition between what went before and what comes after.
272940	278220	If you think we haven't captured the instantaneous moment that one species turns into another,
278220	280540	that's because there isn't one.
280540	285220	It's like asking where's the intermediate form between this and this?
285220	289580	We know that this species existed at one time and is now gone and it seems to have been
289580	291500	replaced by this species.
291500	297020	We can scour the archives and dig up as many transitional photos of George Bush as we like,
297020	302420	but we're never going to find a single shot of Dubya changing from a baby into a man.
302420	306500	What we will find are the various transitional forms in between.
306500	310900	If you're talking about gaps in the record, sure, there are lots of them.
310900	315260	This is all I could find when I googled images from the life of George Bush, so of course
315260	316640	there are gaps.
316640	320780	If I went on a digging expedition I could probably find a hundred more, but even if
320780	325840	I had a thousand chronologically spaced photos of George Bush, there would still be gaps
325840	327220	in between.
327220	331900	As I mentioned in the last video, we now know that evolution, just like the growth of George
331900	334460	Bush, doesn't happen evenly.
334460	339580	The few years in between this photo and this one mark very few changes, but there's been
339580	344180	a huge change in the same period of time between this photo and this one.
344180	348460	But even when evolution happens quickly it's still not instantaneous.
348460	353460	For some animals we've got a very good fossil record and the time gaps between fossils are
353460	354460	small.
354460	356180	This shows evolution very clearly.
356180	360580	For other animals the gaps are longer and the record is far less complete.
360580	363940	Yes, I get that a lot.
363940	368300	A theory in scientific nomenclature is the highest form of proof you can get.
368300	371660	To go any higher you have to enter the realm of mathematics.
371660	376260	In all the sciences there's still a lot more to discover, a lot more to understand and
376260	381260	a lot more to explain, whether it's atomic theory, the theory of gravity or the theory
381260	382660	of evolution.
382660	387260	These are all called theories, so if you don't understand what a theory is in scientific
387260	390560	terms then they're what you would call facts.
390560	394000	And using common terminology evolution is a fact.
394000	399280	It's so much a fact that researchers now depend on evolutionary theory to study antibiotic
399280	404840	resistance and crop pests and new diseases and to develop new drugs.
404840	409560	Understanding evolution isn't just important for understanding our past, but our future.
