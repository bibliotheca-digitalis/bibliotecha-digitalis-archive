00:00.000 --> 00:06.000
You might be forgiven for not recognising this guy, or his name, Adnan Akhtar.

00:06.000 --> 00:10.000
But this is the famous Harun Yahya. Remember him?

00:10.000 --> 00:13.000
He wrote that book that Aminakin found so compelling.

00:13.000 --> 00:17.000
And here he is with his followers, discussing organ donation.

00:17.000 --> 00:18.000
Hmm, okay.

00:18.000 --> 00:22.000
And here he is with more of his followers, talking about the love of Allah.

00:22.000 --> 00:23.000
What the...

00:23.000 --> 00:28.000
Have I accidentally wandered into Akhtar's Islamic version of the Playboy Mansion?

00:28.000 --> 00:30.000
No, a lot of his videos are like this.

00:30.000 --> 00:33.000
But can we drag ourselves away from the table for a minute

00:33.000 --> 00:36.000
and look at Akhtar's Breach of the Ninth Commandment

00:36.000 --> 00:40.000
that was nominated for the 2012 Golden Crocoduck?

00:40.000 --> 00:46.000
This video wasn't ready by voting time, so I'm carrying over the nomination for 2013.

00:46.000 --> 00:49.000
The nomination wasn't for any of Akhtar's videos,

00:49.000 --> 00:53.000
it was for a claim in his book called The Atlas of Creation.

00:53.000 --> 00:58.000
It's really just lots of photographs of lots of fossils linked by one common claim.

00:58.000 --> 01:02.000
They're all supposed to show that organisms have not evolved.

01:02.000 --> 01:05.000
They've stayed the same for millions of years.

01:05.000 --> 01:09.000
Now I have to point out that Akhtar doesn't take kindly to criticism.

01:09.000 --> 01:13.000
Turkish courts have banned websites that Akhtar claims to fame him,

01:13.000 --> 01:18.000
and he's threatened to sue Richard Dawkins when he slammed the Atlas of Creation.

01:18.000 --> 01:22.000
So before I go on, I have an important question to consider.

01:22.000 --> 01:26.000
Should I start this video with Akhtar's hilariously stupid mistakes,

01:26.000 --> 01:30.000
or should I first explain why it's all scientific claptrap?

01:30.000 --> 01:33.000
Hmm, let's start with a laugh.

01:33.000 --> 01:36.000
Here's page 468 of the Atlas of Creation.

01:36.000 --> 01:39.000
As with every example of non-evolution in the book,

01:39.000 --> 01:42.000
it shows a picture of a fossil organism,

01:42.000 --> 01:46.000
and then shows supposedly the same species today.

01:46.000 --> 01:48.000
See? No difference.

01:48.000 --> 01:53.000
The fact that eels, as Akhtar explains, have not undergone any change in millions of years

01:53.000 --> 01:57.000
once again reveals the invalidity of the theory of evolution.

01:57.000 --> 02:01.000
But when Richard Dawkins looked at this, he noticed something odd.

02:01.000 --> 02:04.000
That modern eel is actually a snake.

02:04.000 --> 02:08.000
When Dawkins exposed this and other Atlas of Creation flaws,

02:08.000 --> 02:12.000
the snake disappeared from the online version without explanation.

02:12.000 --> 02:15.000
It was Akhtar's equivalent of the Moncton manoeuvre.

02:15.000 --> 02:18.000
If you get caught out, quietly change your position,

02:18.000 --> 02:21.000
but never admit you got something wrong.

02:21.000 --> 02:25.000
Unfortunately for Akhtar, it wasn't possible to magically change

02:25.000 --> 02:28.000
the thousands of hardback copies of the Atlas of Creation,

02:28.000 --> 02:30.000
so the mistake is still in there,

02:30.000 --> 02:34.000
and these have been given out to schools, universities and libraries.

02:34.000 --> 02:36.000
And here's another example.

02:36.000 --> 02:40.000
What I see on page 244 of the version I downloaded

02:40.000 --> 02:43.000
is a picture of a modern caddisfly.

02:43.000 --> 02:47.000
But what readers see in the hardback copy is a picture of a modern caddisfly

02:47.000 --> 02:50.000
with a mysterious hook coming out of its backside.

02:50.000 --> 02:53.000
This is actually a fishing lure.

02:53.000 --> 02:55.000
Another example?

02:55.000 --> 02:58.000
Here's one that's not only in the hardback version,

02:58.000 --> 03:01.000
it's still in the online version of the book,

03:01.000 --> 03:04.000
an imaginary transitional fossil linking dinosaurs and birds

03:04.000 --> 03:07.000
that Akhtar says doesn't exist.

03:08.000 --> 03:10.000
And yet not only do they exist,

03:10.000 --> 03:13.000
they look remarkably like the photoshopped image

03:13.000 --> 03:16.000
Akhtar imagines they should look like.

03:16.000 --> 03:20.000
But these mistakes are not the reason Akhtar was nominated for a Golden Crocoduck.

03:20.000 --> 03:24.000
So let's move on to demolish his main argument, which is quite simple.

03:24.000 --> 03:28.000
Here's a modern organism, here's a fossil of its ancestor,

03:28.000 --> 03:31.000
they've never undergone even the slightest change.

03:31.000 --> 03:33.000
How do we know they haven't?

03:33.000 --> 03:35.000
Because Akhtar says so.

03:35.000 --> 03:37.000
How do we know Akhtar's right?

03:37.000 --> 03:39.000
Because he says he is.

03:39.000 --> 03:42.000
Now if you believe anything you're told simply because someone says so,

03:42.000 --> 03:44.000
then you probably believe him.

03:44.000 --> 03:48.000
But if you wonder why Akhtar can't cite a single source or a study

03:48.000 --> 03:52.000
to back up his claim that they haven't undergone the slightest change,

03:52.000 --> 03:57.000
then you're probably not quite ready to believe him until you've checked the facts.

03:57.000 --> 03:59.000
So let's do that.

03:59.000 --> 04:03.000
Akhtar probably got the impression that life forms have never undergone even the slightest change

04:03.000 --> 04:06.000
because he heard the phrase living fossils,

04:06.000 --> 04:12.000
to describe a few species that have survived unchanged over hundreds of millions of years.

04:12.000 --> 04:17.000
Without having actually studied these fossils, he takes that literally.

04:17.000 --> 04:21.000
But the term living fossils is just an expression.

04:21.000 --> 04:27.000
As every paleontologist knows, these fossils are not identical to their modern equivalents.

04:27.000 --> 04:30.000
That's just a matter of simple observation.

04:30.000 --> 04:36.000
Even the coelacanth, so beloved of creationists as an example of an organism that never evolved,

04:36.000 --> 04:42.000
did indeed evolve, and the modern coelacanth shows a number of differences compared to its ancestor.

04:42.000 --> 04:48.000
The wolf skull, another example in Akhtar's book that he claims hasn't changed in 20 million years,

04:48.000 --> 04:51.000
has in fact changed in just the last 12,000 years.

04:51.000 --> 04:56.000
Researchers have even compared the DNA of modern wolves with ice age wolves,

04:56.000 --> 05:02.000
so not only do we have physiological differences, their DNA is also very different.

05:02.000 --> 05:08.000
Since all these differences between new and ancestral species exist from simple observation,

05:08.000 --> 05:13.000
then they must have changed, and that means they evolved.

05:13.000 --> 05:19.000
So the fact that Akhtar is willing to deny something that can be observed with nothing more than a pair of glasses

05:19.000 --> 05:22.000
is what's earned him a Golden Crocoduck nomination.

05:22.000 --> 05:28.000
But to overcome any confusion, I think it's worth explaining why some organisms change very little over time,

05:28.000 --> 05:30.000
while others change a lot.

05:30.000 --> 05:34.000
Why haven't coelacanths or sharks changed more drastically

05:34.000 --> 05:40.000
in the same way that dinosaurs became chickens and tiny mammals became whales?

05:40.000 --> 05:45.000
The answer lies in the mechanism for evolution, natural selection.

05:45.000 --> 05:49.000
It doesn't run on a grand Frankenstein plan to create new creatures,

05:49.000 --> 05:56.000
it's about the best adapted organism passing on its DNA more successfully than the less well adapted organism.

05:56.000 --> 06:01.000
Radical changes to species tend to happen as a result of radical changes in the environment.

06:01.000 --> 06:09.000
A change in climate, a change in food source, a change in predation, a change in prey, a new disease, a new niche.

06:09.000 --> 06:13.000
All of these things force animals to either adapt or die.

06:13.000 --> 06:18.000
But if an animal living in the depths of the ocean doesn't experience much environmental change,

06:18.000 --> 06:22.000
then it won't experience much morphological change.

06:22.000 --> 06:25.000
Let me put it another way, if an environment gets colder,

06:25.000 --> 06:30.000
then a gene that gives thicker hair will ensure better survival and get passed on.

06:30.000 --> 06:37.000
A hundred other traits would also be favoured to radically change a warm environment animal into a cold one.

06:37.000 --> 06:41.000
But if the environment doesn't change and doesn't get colder,

06:41.000 --> 06:45.000
then any animals with a thick hair gene will be at a disadvantage.

06:45.000 --> 06:47.000
The gene won't get passed on.

06:47.000 --> 06:51.000
Why should they change? What's the advantage?

06:51.000 --> 06:57.000
So it's not that evolution doesn't happen in sharks and crocodiles and coelacanths, clearly it does.

06:57.000 --> 07:03.000
It's just that these animals are well adapted to their environment and there's no selective pressure on them to change.

07:03.000 --> 07:08.000
But it's only these more stable organisms that make it into the atlas of creation.

07:08.000 --> 07:15.000
Oktar leaves out all the others, the vast majority, that have undergone much more rapid evolutionary changes,

07:15.000 --> 07:18.000
from horses to cetaceans to bivalves.

07:18.000 --> 07:23.000
Why does he leave them out when these drastic changes are so obvious and so clear?

07:23.000 --> 07:26.000
I think I've just answered my own question.
