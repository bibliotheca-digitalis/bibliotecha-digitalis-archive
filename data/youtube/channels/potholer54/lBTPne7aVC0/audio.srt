1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,000
You might be forgiven for not recognising this guy, or his name, Adnan Akhtar.

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:10,000
But this is the famous Harun Yahya. Remember him?

3
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:13,000
He wrote that book that Aminakin found so compelling.

4
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:17,000
And here he is with his followers, discussing organ donation.

5
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:18,000
Hmm, okay.

6
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:22,000
And here he is with more of his followers, talking about the love of Allah.

7
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:23,000
What the...

8
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:28,000
Have I accidentally wandered into Akhtar's Islamic version of the Playboy Mansion?

9
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:30,000
No, a lot of his videos are like this.

10
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,000
But can we drag ourselves away from the table for a minute

11
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:36,000
and look at Akhtar's Breach of the Ninth Commandment

12
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:40,000
that was nominated for the 2012 Golden Crocoduck?

13
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:46,000
This video wasn't ready by voting time, so I'm carrying over the nomination for 2013.

14
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:49,000
The nomination wasn't for any of Akhtar's videos,

15
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:53,000
it was for a claim in his book called The Atlas of Creation.

16
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:58,000
It's really just lots of photographs of lots of fossils linked by one common claim.

17
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:02,000
They're all supposed to show that organisms have not evolved.

18
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:05,000
They've stayed the same for millions of years.

19
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:09,000
Now I have to point out that Akhtar doesn't take kindly to criticism.

20
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:13,000
Turkish courts have banned websites that Akhtar claims to fame him,

21
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:18,000
and he's threatened to sue Richard Dawkins when he slammed the Atlas of Creation.

22
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:22,000
So before I go on, I have an important question to consider.

23
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:26,000
Should I start this video with Akhtar's hilariously stupid mistakes,

24
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:30,000
or should I first explain why it's all scientific claptrap?

25
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:33,000
Hmm, let's start with a laugh.

26
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:36,000
Here's page 468 of the Atlas of Creation.

27
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:39,000
As with every example of non-evolution in the book,

28
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:42,000
it shows a picture of a fossil organism,

29
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:46,000
and then shows supposedly the same species today.

30
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,000
See? No difference.

31
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:53,000
The fact that eels, as Akhtar explains, have not undergone any change in millions of years

32
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:57,000
once again reveals the invalidity of the theory of evolution.

33
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:01,000
But when Richard Dawkins looked at this, he noticed something odd.

34
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:04,000
That modern eel is actually a snake.

35
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:08,000
When Dawkins exposed this and other Atlas of Creation flaws,

36
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:12,000
the snake disappeared from the online version without explanation.

37
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:15,000
It was Akhtar's equivalent of the Moncton manoeuvre.

38
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:18,000
If you get caught out, quietly change your position,

39
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:21,000
but never admit you got something wrong.

40
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:25,000
Unfortunately for Akhtar, it wasn't possible to magically change

41
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:28,000
the thousands of hardback copies of the Atlas of Creation,

42
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,000
so the mistake is still in there,

43
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:34,000
and these have been given out to schools, universities and libraries.

44
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,000
And here's another example.

45
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:40,000
What I see on page 244 of the version I downloaded

46
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:43,000
is a picture of a modern caddisfly.

47
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:47,000
But what readers see in the hardback copy is a picture of a modern caddisfly

48
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:50,000
with a mysterious hook coming out of its backside.

49
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:53,000
This is actually a fishing lure.

50
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:55,000
Another example?

51
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:58,000
Here's one that's not only in the hardback version,

52
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:01,000
it's still in the online version of the book,

53
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:04,000
an imaginary transitional fossil linking dinosaurs and birds

54
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:07,000
that Akhtar says doesn't exist.

55
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,000
And yet not only do they exist,

56
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:13,000
they look remarkably like the photoshopped image

57
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:16,000
Akhtar imagines they should look like.

58
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:20,000
But these mistakes are not the reason Akhtar was nominated for a Golden Crocoduck.

59
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:24,000
So let's move on to demolish his main argument, which is quite simple.

60
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:28,000
Here's a modern organism, here's a fossil of its ancestor,

61
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:31,000
they've never undergone even the slightest change.

62
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:33,000
How do we know they haven't?

63
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:35,000
Because Akhtar says so.

64
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:37,000
How do we know Akhtar's right?

65
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:39,000
Because he says he is.

66
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:42,000
Now if you believe anything you're told simply because someone says so,

67
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,000
then you probably believe him.

68
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:48,000
But if you wonder why Akhtar can't cite a single source or a study

69
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:52,000
to back up his claim that they haven't undergone the slightest change,

70
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:57,000
then you're probably not quite ready to believe him until you've checked the facts.

71
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:59,000
So let's do that.

72
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:03,000
Akhtar probably got the impression that life forms have never undergone even the slightest change

73
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:06,000
because he heard the phrase living fossils,

74
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:12,000
to describe a few species that have survived unchanged over hundreds of millions of years.

75
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:17,000
Without having actually studied these fossils, he takes that literally.

76
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:21,000
But the term living fossils is just an expression.

77
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:27,000
As every paleontologist knows, these fossils are not identical to their modern equivalents.

78
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:30,000
That's just a matter of simple observation.

79
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:36,000
Even the coelacanth, so beloved of creationists as an example of an organism that never evolved,

80
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:42,000
did indeed evolve, and the modern coelacanth shows a number of differences compared to its ancestor.

81
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:48,000
The wolf skull, another example in Akhtar's book that he claims hasn't changed in 20 million years,

82
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:51,000
has in fact changed in just the last 12,000 years.

83
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:56,000
Researchers have even compared the DNA of modern wolves with ice age wolves,

84
00:04:56,000 --> 00:05:02,000
so not only do we have physiological differences, their DNA is also very different.

85
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:08,000
Since all these differences between new and ancestral species exist from simple observation,

86
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:13,000
then they must have changed, and that means they evolved.

87
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:19,000
So the fact that Akhtar is willing to deny something that can be observed with nothing more than a pair of glasses

88
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:22,000
is what's earned him a Golden Crocoduck nomination.

89
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:28,000
But to overcome any confusion, I think it's worth explaining why some organisms change very little over time,

90
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:30,000
while others change a lot.

91
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:34,000
Why haven't coelacanths or sharks changed more drastically

92
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:40,000
in the same way that dinosaurs became chickens and tiny mammals became whales?

93
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:45,000
The answer lies in the mechanism for evolution, natural selection.

94
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:49,000
It doesn't run on a grand Frankenstein plan to create new creatures,

95
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:56,000
it's about the best adapted organism passing on its DNA more successfully than the less well adapted organism.

96
00:05:56,000 --> 00:06:01,000
Radical changes to species tend to happen as a result of radical changes in the environment.

97
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:09,000
A change in climate, a change in food source, a change in predation, a change in prey, a new disease, a new niche.

98
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:13,000
All of these things force animals to either adapt or die.

99
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:18,000
But if an animal living in the depths of the ocean doesn't experience much environmental change,

100
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:22,000
then it won't experience much morphological change.

101
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:25,000
Let me put it another way, if an environment gets colder,

102
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:30,000
then a gene that gives thicker hair will ensure better survival and get passed on.

103
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:37,000
A hundred other traits would also be favoured to radically change a warm environment animal into a cold one.

104
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:41,000
But if the environment doesn't change and doesn't get colder,

105
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:45,000
then any animals with a thick hair gene will be at a disadvantage.

106
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:47,000
The gene won't get passed on.

107
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:51,000
Why should they change? What's the advantage?

108
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:57,000
So it's not that evolution doesn't happen in sharks and crocodiles and coelacanths, clearly it does.

109
00:06:57,000 --> 00:07:03,000
It's just that these animals are well adapted to their environment and there's no selective pressure on them to change.

110
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:08,000
But it's only these more stable organisms that make it into the atlas of creation.

111
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:15,000
Oktar leaves out all the others, the vast majority, that have undergone much more rapid evolutionary changes,

112
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:18,000
from horses to cetaceans to bivalves.

113
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:23,000
Why does he leave them out when these drastic changes are so obvious and so clear?

114
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:26,000
I think I've just answered my own question.
