0	6000	You might be forgiven for not recognising this guy, or his name, Adnan Akhtar.
6000	10000	But this is the famous Harun Yahya. Remember him?
10000	13000	He wrote that book that Aminakin found so compelling.
13000	17000	And here he is with his followers, discussing organ donation.
17000	18000	Hmm, okay.
18000	22000	And here he is with more of his followers, talking about the love of Allah.
22000	23000	What the...
23000	28000	Have I accidentally wandered into Akhtar's Islamic version of the Playboy Mansion?
28000	30000	No, a lot of his videos are like this.
30000	33000	But can we drag ourselves away from the table for a minute
33000	36000	and look at Akhtar's Breach of the Ninth Commandment
36000	40000	that was nominated for the 2012 Golden Crocoduck?
40000	46000	This video wasn't ready by voting time, so I'm carrying over the nomination for 2013.
46000	49000	The nomination wasn't for any of Akhtar's videos,
49000	53000	it was for a claim in his book called The Atlas of Creation.
53000	58000	It's really just lots of photographs of lots of fossils linked by one common claim.
58000	62000	They're all supposed to show that organisms have not evolved.
62000	65000	They've stayed the same for millions of years.
65000	69000	Now I have to point out that Akhtar doesn't take kindly to criticism.
69000	73000	Turkish courts have banned websites that Akhtar claims to fame him,
73000	78000	and he's threatened to sue Richard Dawkins when he slammed the Atlas of Creation.
78000	82000	So before I go on, I have an important question to consider.
82000	86000	Should I start this video with Akhtar's hilariously stupid mistakes,
86000	90000	or should I first explain why it's all scientific claptrap?
90000	93000	Hmm, let's start with a laugh.
93000	96000	Here's page 468 of the Atlas of Creation.
96000	99000	As with every example of non-evolution in the book,
99000	102000	it shows a picture of a fossil organism,
102000	106000	and then shows supposedly the same species today.
106000	108000	See? No difference.
108000	113000	The fact that eels, as Akhtar explains, have not undergone any change in millions of years
113000	117000	once again reveals the invalidity of the theory of evolution.
117000	121000	But when Richard Dawkins looked at this, he noticed something odd.
121000	124000	That modern eel is actually a snake.
124000	128000	When Dawkins exposed this and other Atlas of Creation flaws,
128000	132000	the snake disappeared from the online version without explanation.
132000	135000	It was Akhtar's equivalent of the Moncton manoeuvre.
135000	138000	If you get caught out, quietly change your position,
138000	141000	but never admit you got something wrong.
141000	145000	Unfortunately for Akhtar, it wasn't possible to magically change
145000	148000	the thousands of hardback copies of the Atlas of Creation,
148000	150000	so the mistake is still in there,
150000	154000	and these have been given out to schools, universities and libraries.
154000	156000	And here's another example.
156000	160000	What I see on page 244 of the version I downloaded
160000	163000	is a picture of a modern caddisfly.
163000	167000	But what readers see in the hardback copy is a picture of a modern caddisfly
167000	170000	with a mysterious hook coming out of its backside.
170000	173000	This is actually a fishing lure.
173000	175000	Another example?
175000	178000	Here's one that's not only in the hardback version,
178000	181000	it's still in the online version of the book,
181000	184000	an imaginary transitional fossil linking dinosaurs and birds
184000	187000	that Akhtar says doesn't exist.
188000	190000	And yet not only do they exist,
190000	193000	they look remarkably like the photoshopped image
193000	196000	Akhtar imagines they should look like.
196000	200000	But these mistakes are not the reason Akhtar was nominated for a Golden Crocoduck.
200000	204000	So let's move on to demolish his main argument, which is quite simple.
204000	208000	Here's a modern organism, here's a fossil of its ancestor,
208000	211000	they've never undergone even the slightest change.
211000	213000	How do we know they haven't?
213000	215000	Because Akhtar says so.
215000	217000	How do we know Akhtar's right?
217000	219000	Because he says he is.
219000	222000	Now if you believe anything you're told simply because someone says so,
222000	224000	then you probably believe him.
224000	228000	But if you wonder why Akhtar can't cite a single source or a study
228000	232000	to back up his claim that they haven't undergone the slightest change,
232000	237000	then you're probably not quite ready to believe him until you've checked the facts.
237000	239000	So let's do that.
239000	243000	Akhtar probably got the impression that life forms have never undergone even the slightest change
243000	246000	because he heard the phrase living fossils,
246000	252000	to describe a few species that have survived unchanged over hundreds of millions of years.
252000	257000	Without having actually studied these fossils, he takes that literally.
257000	261000	But the term living fossils is just an expression.
261000	267000	As every paleontologist knows, these fossils are not identical to their modern equivalents.
267000	270000	That's just a matter of simple observation.
270000	276000	Even the coelacanth, so beloved of creationists as an example of an organism that never evolved,
276000	282000	did indeed evolve, and the modern coelacanth shows a number of differences compared to its ancestor.
282000	288000	The wolf skull, another example in Akhtar's book that he claims hasn't changed in 20 million years,
288000	291000	has in fact changed in just the last 12,000 years.
291000	296000	Researchers have even compared the DNA of modern wolves with ice age wolves,
296000	302000	so not only do we have physiological differences, their DNA is also very different.
302000	308000	Since all these differences between new and ancestral species exist from simple observation,
308000	313000	then they must have changed, and that means they evolved.
313000	319000	So the fact that Akhtar is willing to deny something that can be observed with nothing more than a pair of glasses
319000	322000	is what's earned him a Golden Crocoduck nomination.
322000	328000	But to overcome any confusion, I think it's worth explaining why some organisms change very little over time,
328000	330000	while others change a lot.
330000	334000	Why haven't coelacanths or sharks changed more drastically
334000	340000	in the same way that dinosaurs became chickens and tiny mammals became whales?
340000	345000	The answer lies in the mechanism for evolution, natural selection.
345000	349000	It doesn't run on a grand Frankenstein plan to create new creatures,
349000	356000	it's about the best adapted organism passing on its DNA more successfully than the less well adapted organism.
356000	361000	Radical changes to species tend to happen as a result of radical changes in the environment.
361000	369000	A change in climate, a change in food source, a change in predation, a change in prey, a new disease, a new niche.
369000	373000	All of these things force animals to either adapt or die.
373000	378000	But if an animal living in the depths of the ocean doesn't experience much environmental change,
378000	382000	then it won't experience much morphological change.
382000	385000	Let me put it another way, if an environment gets colder,
385000	390000	then a gene that gives thicker hair will ensure better survival and get passed on.
390000	397000	A hundred other traits would also be favoured to radically change a warm environment animal into a cold one.
397000	401000	But if the environment doesn't change and doesn't get colder,
401000	405000	then any animals with a thick hair gene will be at a disadvantage.
405000	407000	The gene won't get passed on.
407000	411000	Why should they change? What's the advantage?
411000	417000	So it's not that evolution doesn't happen in sharks and crocodiles and coelacanths, clearly it does.
417000	423000	It's just that these animals are well adapted to their environment and there's no selective pressure on them to change.
423000	428000	But it's only these more stable organisms that make it into the atlas of creation.
428000	435000	Oktar leaves out all the others, the vast majority, that have undergone much more rapid evolutionary changes,
435000	438000	from horses to cetaceans to bivalves.
438000	443000	Why does he leave them out when these drastic changes are so obvious and so clear?
443000	446000	I think I've just answered my own question.
