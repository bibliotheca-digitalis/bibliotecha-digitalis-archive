00:00.000 --> 00:06.340
Now, scientists say that the earth is 5 billion years old and the Bible says it's 6,000 to

00:06.340 --> 00:07.880
10,000 years old.

00:07.880 --> 00:10.920
So this demonstration is going to prove a big point.

00:10.920 --> 00:13.680
Here's some friendly advice for creationists.

00:13.680 --> 00:18.140
Please before you do something like this and cause atheists to collapse into uncontrollable

00:18.140 --> 00:23.300
laughter, please check with a scientist or a science major or perhaps a 7-year-old who's

00:23.300 --> 00:27.940
just started learning science in elementary school and find out why whatever theory you've

00:27.940 --> 00:32.300
dreamed up at the end of a spade doesn't work in the real world.

00:32.300 --> 00:38.620
So you may wonder why digging a hole is going to help Frank here debunk 200 years of geology.

00:38.620 --> 00:43.140
So let's fast forward.

00:43.140 --> 00:48.060
As you're starting to see the clean soil come up.

00:48.060 --> 00:50.440
Get on with it.

00:50.440 --> 00:57.400
If you notice, you'll see the dirty soil that's on the top and below you start to see

00:57.400 --> 01:00.340
the soil come clean.

01:00.340 --> 01:08.120
If the earth is 5 billion years old, this dark mulch should be 10, 20, 30 feet thick.

01:08.120 --> 01:09.980
It's not even a foot.

01:09.980 --> 01:11.800
How is the earth 5 billion years old?

01:11.800 --> 01:15.480
It's the biggest bullshit ever told to man.

01:15.480 --> 01:18.600
Oh, that's it.

01:18.600 --> 01:19.600
Right.

01:19.600 --> 01:20.600
Well, where do I start?

01:20.600 --> 01:21.600
Okay.

01:21.600 --> 01:23.840
Let's start with what Frank calls dirty soil.

01:23.840 --> 01:28.440
I think he's referring to topsoil or humus, which is where weathered rock is mixed with

01:28.440 --> 01:29.780
organic material.

01:29.780 --> 01:37.320
If the earth is 5 billion years old, this dark mulch should be 10, 20, 30 feet thick.

01:37.320 --> 01:38.320
Okay.

01:38.320 --> 01:42.220
That means that for whatever reason, Frank thinks topsoil accumulates at the rate on

01:42.220 --> 01:46.340
average of one foot every 250 million years.

01:46.340 --> 01:51.000
That would make this layer 250 million years old then, right, Frank?

01:51.000 --> 01:52.800
According to your reckoning.

01:52.800 --> 01:57.800
So although Frank thought he was trying to prove that the earth is just 6,500 years old,

01:57.800 --> 02:00.000
his own math has tripped him up.

02:00.000 --> 02:05.020
But it doesn't matter because topsoil doesn't accumulate like that anyway, at least in what

02:05.020 --> 02:07.740
the rest of us call real life.

02:07.740 --> 02:12.800
In real life, topsoil is by definition always going to be at the top because that's where

02:12.800 --> 02:16.040
organic matter is mixing in with the soil.

02:16.040 --> 02:21.080
Now it does vary in depth because it's always being eroded on higher slopes and accumulating

02:21.080 --> 02:25.000
in alluvial plains and eventually dumped at sea.

02:25.000 --> 02:30.360
As the soil gets eroded, new soil is being produced by weathering at the rock face.

02:30.360 --> 02:34.920
When ice sheets extend across the higher latitudes, as they have done several times in the last

02:34.920 --> 02:38.520
million years, the soil is scraped away completely.

02:38.520 --> 02:42.360
It's replaced by new soil every time there's an interglacial.

02:42.360 --> 02:47.480
Of course this constant weathering into new soil grinds mountains down, so when sea levels

02:47.480 --> 02:53.000
rise and cover this eroded landscape with sediment, the old soil gets buried.

02:53.000 --> 02:55.440
Over time it becomes fossilised.

02:55.440 --> 03:01.040
We can see these so-called paleosoils in a place that the rest of us call the real world.

03:01.040 --> 03:06.340
You can even see ancient worm casts and fossilised plant roots in these paleosoils.

03:06.340 --> 03:10.540
So geologically speaking, soils aren't that old.

03:10.540 --> 03:15.700
But the biggest problem I have with Frank's theory is the injuries we might sustain laughing

03:15.700 --> 03:19.640
at a desperate creationist digging himself into a hole.

03:19.640 --> 03:21.940
And Frank isn't the only culprit.

03:21.940 --> 03:29.580
So this video is an appeal to creationists, please stop, you're killing us.

03:29.580 --> 03:33.300
Over the centuries you've tortured, burned and massacred people who don't accept your

03:33.300 --> 03:39.140
beliefs and I hope that in the 21st century this would have stopped, but no, I've been

03:39.140 --> 03:44.700
getting messages from my subscribers who say they've been seriously hurt or incapacitated

03:44.700 --> 03:48.980
while laughing at your creationist claims.

03:48.980 --> 03:54.160
Rage Unchained, for example, laughed so much at Kent Hovind's claim about carbon dating

03:54.160 --> 03:57.180
that his anal sphincter became detached.

03:57.180 --> 04:01.700
Here's an appeal from a desperate Eorgorinkon with a dire prediction.

04:01.700 --> 04:06.900
Sadly he passed away last month after watching another Ken Ham video.

04:06.900 --> 04:11.380
The list of injuries because of your hilarious statements goes on and on.

04:11.380 --> 04:18.740
An injured jaw, headaches, loss of bladder control, aching muscles.

04:18.740 --> 04:23.620
A number of people even experienced spontaneous combustors nostrallis thanks to Richard Kent

04:23.620 --> 04:29.500
and his dragon claim, including Jacob Paprotsky, who sent me this photo.

04:29.500 --> 04:33.980
Doctors say he'll never again be able to breathe properly or bear children.

04:33.980 --> 04:38.300
Facetious Badger was seriously injured when coffee spat out of his nose.

04:38.300 --> 04:40.700
Now he's suing me for a replacement keyboard.

04:40.700 --> 04:44.740
Does the agony never end?

04:44.740 --> 04:46.700
Now I know what you're going to say, creationists.

04:46.700 --> 04:51.780
It's my mocking, scoffing derision of the things you say that's funny, not you.

04:51.780 --> 04:57.180
It's my fault that so many decent, honest atheists are splitting their sides, or worse,

04:57.180 --> 04:58.820
dying of laughter.

04:58.820 --> 05:01.420
But no, it's not me, it's you.

05:01.420 --> 05:04.820
What you say is genuinely funny.

05:04.820 --> 05:09.540
Now you may argue, well, atheism's pretty funny too, and creationists therefore face

05:09.540 --> 05:11.680
a similar danger to their health.

05:11.680 --> 05:16.140
I'm sorry, but if that was true, then you'd be able to make an amusing video out of something

05:16.140 --> 05:20.020
atheists have said, or something that's accepted science.

05:20.020 --> 05:21.020
But you can't.

05:21.020 --> 05:26.100
Here, for example, is a Golden Crocoduck-nominated video that ought to be funny, because it's

05:26.100 --> 05:28.620
called Atheism is Funny.

05:28.620 --> 05:31.940
Well, let the hilarity begin.

05:31.940 --> 05:34.020
You know, atheism is funny.

05:34.020 --> 05:35.580
How funny is it?

05:35.580 --> 05:43.200
Proponents of atheism laugh at us Christians for believing in the Bible, yet they themselves

05:43.200 --> 05:49.780
completely ignore the fact that they take a fifth grader's science book as infallible

05:49.780 --> 05:51.420
as well.

05:51.420 --> 05:54.620
Hmm, anyone find that funny?

05:54.620 --> 05:58.640
Okay, a creationist does.

05:58.640 --> 06:04.060
The reason no one else is laughing is obvious, because atheists don't think a fifth grader's

06:04.060 --> 06:05.980
science book is infallible.

06:05.980 --> 06:12.040
I mean, by definition, no science book is infallible, because science isn't infallible.

06:12.040 --> 06:17.700
Scientific knowledge is constantly being updated and corrected as new evidence comes along.

06:17.700 --> 06:19.700
And the video gets sillier.

06:19.700 --> 06:24.780
They also regard flesh and blood as infallible.

06:24.780 --> 06:29.220
Here is just a small list of infallible atheists.

06:29.220 --> 06:30.780
Number one, Richard Dawkins.

06:30.780 --> 06:33.420
Richard Dawkins is infallible?

06:33.420 --> 06:36.540
Even Richard Dawkins wouldn't claim he's infallible.

06:36.540 --> 06:40.620
And if he did claim he was infallible, then he'd obviously be wrong.

06:40.620 --> 06:43.540
And if he's wrong, then he can't be infallible.

06:43.540 --> 06:45.500
I suppose that's funny.

06:45.500 --> 06:50.820
Similarly, it's hard to see the joke in this attempt at humour by Ray, the Chuckle King,

06:50.820 --> 06:51.820
Comfort.

06:51.820 --> 06:55.940
Let's now join our correspondent live in the swamps of Gobble Epus.

06:55.940 --> 07:02.860
This amazing animal looks like a duck, but it has the head of some sort of amphibian.

07:02.860 --> 07:05.340
This is tremendously exciting.

07:05.340 --> 07:07.620
Darwin would have been ecstatic.

07:07.620 --> 07:13.860
It's a crocodile that has evolved into a duck, or perhaps a duck that has evolved into a

07:13.860 --> 07:14.860
crocodile.

07:14.860 --> 07:20.860
This almost cute little creature is so close, I could even reach out and touch it.

07:33.860 --> 07:39.820
But as Comfort accepts in the same video, biologists don't believe this creationist

07:39.820 --> 07:41.940
invention ever existed.

07:41.940 --> 07:43.620
So where's the joke?

07:43.620 --> 07:48.820
See, observable humour like this is about observing something that's real.

07:48.820 --> 07:53.540
For example, Jerry Seinfeld made a joke wondering why skydivers wear crash helmets.

07:53.540 --> 08:02.300
In regards to the skydiving, what is the point of the helmet in the skydiving?

08:02.740 --> 08:09.620
Yeah, it's a funny observation because skydivers really do wear crash helmets.

08:09.620 --> 08:13.620
If you'd made a joke about the fact that skydivers wear ballet shoes, you know, something

08:13.620 --> 08:18.360
like what are they hoping to do a pirouette when they land, that wouldn't be funny because

08:18.360 --> 08:22.020
obviously skydivers don't wear ballet shoes.

08:22.020 --> 08:23.020
Get it?

08:23.020 --> 08:28.340
Creationists, what makes your beliefs so debilitatingly funny is that you do believe your book is

08:28.340 --> 08:29.340
infallible.

08:29.380 --> 08:34.120
A lot of you do think there ought to be such a thing as a crocoduck in the theory of evolution.

08:34.120 --> 08:39.060
So trying to apply these attributes to atheism or science only points to the fact that atheism

08:39.060 --> 08:42.520
and science don't have any of these wacky beliefs.

08:42.520 --> 08:46.180
That's what makes what we say so inherently unfunny.

08:46.180 --> 08:49.960
To see if someone's managed to get a laugh out of what atheists actually believe and

08:49.960 --> 08:54.900
what science really says, I had to turn, of course, to Conservopedia.

08:54.900 --> 08:59.580
You may have something that sounds promisingly funny, Top 10 Telltale Signs You're On Your

08:59.580 --> 09:02.420
Way To Being A Lonely Atheist Nerd.

09:02.420 --> 09:07.300
So a warning, you may split your sides and experience incontinence reading what promises

09:07.300 --> 09:09.300
to be a hilarious list.

09:21.300 --> 09:24.660
Top 10 Telltale Signs You're On Your Way To Being A Lonely Atheist Nerd.

09:24.660 --> 09:29.060
Number one, when you're at your girlfriend's house, you can't stop scowling at her mother's

09:29.060 --> 09:30.620
picture of Jesus.

09:30.620 --> 09:33.220
Please see the atheist and evolutionist helpline.

09:33.220 --> 09:35.760
Ooh, tough crowd.

09:35.760 --> 09:38.100
You own more pocket protectors than shirts.

09:38.100 --> 09:41.940
Oh, come on, that was a bit funny.

09:41.940 --> 09:46.180
You tell your girlfriend that she's merely the result of blind, random, natural forces

09:46.180 --> 09:48.480
and there's nothing particularly special about her.

09:48.480 --> 09:52.460
Of course, this lets her know that you're an insensitive liar and she starts crying.

09:53.460 --> 09:56.100
Hmm.

09:56.100 --> 09:59.100
Not so much funny as, well, a bit sad.

09:59.100 --> 10:03.220
Number four, you spent countless hours arguing with your girlfriend on the true definition

10:03.220 --> 10:08.820
of atheism and insist that you're not diluting the definition of atheism given in most encyclopedias

10:08.820 --> 10:09.820
of philosophy.

10:09.820 --> 10:12.820
Oh, someone thinks that's funny.

10:12.820 --> 10:13.820
Wow.

10:13.820 --> 10:18.980
Oh, it's only Ian Juby and he's just chuckling at one of his own atheist jokes.

10:18.980 --> 10:21.980
So okay, let's take a look at that one.

10:22.500 --> 10:26.060
Juby's been reading from a science website explaining a paper about why men are hairier

10:26.060 --> 10:27.180
than women.

10:27.180 --> 10:32.220
The researchers did experiments showing that ectoparasites are more easily detected because

10:32.220 --> 10:37.740
a fine covering of hair makes it more difficult for the parasites to get to exposed skin.

10:37.740 --> 10:42.940
And that means they take longer to crawl around and will be more easily detected.

10:42.940 --> 10:48.300
The conclusion is that hairier men will have fewer parasites and therefore be healthier.

10:48.300 --> 10:52.860
Now there is such a thing as sexual selection, which was actually an old Darwinist idea,

10:52.860 --> 10:57.380
that women, as most men know, are very picky about who they have sex with.

10:57.380 --> 11:02.860
And naturally they go for men who are healthier and more likely to produce healthy offspring.

11:02.860 --> 11:04.900
Or as the website puts it,

11:04.900 --> 11:09.300
Not surprisingly, men were better at detecting bedbugs on the unshaved arm due to having

11:09.300 --> 11:11.540
thicker and longer hair than women.

11:11.540 --> 11:15.680
As to why men are generally hairier looking than women, the researchers suggest it might

11:15.680 --> 11:20.520
be due to something as simple as women preferring men with fewer parasites on them, which would

11:20.520 --> 11:22.680
imply more hair.

11:22.680 --> 11:26.360
Quite interesting, you would have thought, and not particularly funny.

11:26.360 --> 11:29.200
But here's Ian Juby's take on it.

11:29.200 --> 11:34.380
As to why men are generally hairier looking than women, the researchers suggest it might

11:34.380 --> 11:41.240
be due to something as simple as women preferring men with fewer parasites on them, which would

11:41.240 --> 11:42.720
imply more hair.

11:42.720 --> 11:43.720
Wow.

11:44.600 --> 11:46.480
OK Ian, here's the problem.

11:46.480 --> 11:51.600
You can't make something funny just by giggling as you read it, because it mentions body hair,

11:51.600 --> 11:54.920
sex and armpits, unless you're in fifth grade.

11:54.920 --> 11:58.480
You actually get much more of a laugh when you're trying to be serious.

11:58.480 --> 12:03.200
Let's say the sun is orbiting around the earth, then it's going to, over time, it's going

12:03.200 --> 12:07.240
to get out of balance, and it's going to switch places.

12:07.240 --> 12:10.240
But apparently, lay the eggs on the run.

12:10.240 --> 12:12.800
Ian, that's incredible.

12:12.800 --> 12:18.680
But it's this kind of harmful hilarity I'm trying to stop, for the sake of my subscribers.

12:18.680 --> 12:22.400
Finally, onto cartoons, which aren't that much better.

12:22.400 --> 12:24.720
Here's another joke from Conservopedia.

12:24.720 --> 12:28.480
Waitress says, you want proof and evidence that atheism is true?

12:28.480 --> 12:31.760
Nobody has ever asked for that at our atheist restaurant before.

12:31.760 --> 12:35.920
If you're seeking a full course meal of proof and evidence, I suggest going to the Christian

12:35.920 --> 12:37.880
restaurant down the street.

12:37.880 --> 12:41.560
Look, I sympathise.

12:41.560 --> 12:45.240
It's hard to make atheism or scientific facts funny.

12:45.240 --> 12:47.040
Now I know what you're going to say.

12:47.040 --> 12:48.360
But humour is subjective.

12:48.360 --> 12:53.120
I found that cartoon funny, and when Juby giggled at hairy armpits, I cracked up.

12:53.120 --> 12:54.120
You're sincerely Ken Ham.

12:54.120 --> 12:55.680
Oop, what a giveaway.

12:55.680 --> 12:58.420
No, this is more than subjective.

12:58.420 --> 13:04.000
When I searched the term creationist comedian on YouTube, I couldn't find a single one.

13:04.000 --> 13:07.940
There are Christian comedians, but their jokes are all directed at funny things that happen

13:07.940 --> 13:09.720
in churches.

13:09.720 --> 13:14.400
Let's face it, evolution isn't inherently funny, because it just involves organisms

13:14.400 --> 13:20.120
changing slowly over time, through a mechanism we basically understand, and even creationists

13:20.120 --> 13:22.960
accept that they change over time.

13:22.960 --> 13:27.960
Atheists don't have talking snakes, or people springing to life out of lumps of clay, or

13:27.960 --> 13:34.480
ribs, or living inside whales, or weird doctrines that we're forced to follow.

13:34.480 --> 13:44.400
Living women must be shunned, but that, if nothing else, is proof of God's wisdom.

13:44.400 --> 13:55.200
This survey of American beliefs showed that Americans, at a rate of between 48 and 51%,

13:55.200 --> 14:05.960
don't believe in evolution, which is, like, half.

14:05.960 --> 14:11.880
And on top of that 50-odd percent, a further 38 to 40% of Americans believe that biological

14:11.880 --> 14:16.340
evolution has occurred, but believe that it was initiated by, and has since been kind

14:16.340 --> 14:38.300
of administered by, God, leaving a very small percentage of Americans who are right.

14:38.300 --> 14:40.420
It's not my theory.

14:40.420 --> 14:44.340
I've done material about evolution before, and in Australia and in Britain it barely

14:44.340 --> 14:45.340
raises an eyebrow.

14:45.340 --> 14:46.340
It's just worth a chuckle.

14:46.340 --> 14:50.340
But in America it's quite contentious to do comedy about evolution, you know.

14:50.340 --> 14:51.340
It gets a gasp.

14:51.340 --> 14:55.020
It's the equivalent of doing material about fisting anywhere else, you know.

14:55.020 --> 15:01.260
Now on my channel, of course, I couldn't care less about your private beliefs.

15:01.260 --> 15:02.720
You're welcome to them.

15:02.720 --> 15:07.980
The life-threatening laughter here is because of your attempts to marry 21st century science,

15:07.980 --> 15:13.140
or even 16th century science, with the beliefs of people whose most advanced technology was

15:13.140 --> 15:15.460
the open-toed sandal.

15:15.460 --> 15:19.620
It's the ludicrous things you come up with to try to explain it all.

15:19.620 --> 15:24.620
So please, creationists, believe what you like, but stop with the pseudoscience.

15:24.620 --> 15:26.780
Stop being so hysterically funny.

15:26.780 --> 15:29.140
Seriously, you're killing us.

15:29.140 --> 15:34.460
Now how could all that vegetable material be laid down there, and yet this tree trunk

15:34.460 --> 15:35.940
is going through it?

15:35.940 --> 15:40.540
Behold, the atheist's nightmare.

15:40.540 --> 15:45.340
If you're asking me, I firmly believe that the world is getting ready for the tribulation.

15:45.340 --> 15:50.900
Well, what would happen as that poor dinosaur was breathing heavily in and out through those

15:50.900 --> 15:51.900
very narrow nostrils?

15:51.900 --> 15:56.040
Well, I'm telling you what would happen is the nostrils would catch on fire.

15:56.040 --> 16:03.820
If the earth is five billion years old, this dark mulch should be 10, 20, 30 feet thick.

16:03.820 --> 16:05.660
It's not even a foot.

16:05.660 --> 16:07.540
How is the earth five billion years old?

16:07.540 --> 16:09.860
It's the biggest bullshit ever told to man.

16:09.860 --> 16:10.940
Can you imagine that?
