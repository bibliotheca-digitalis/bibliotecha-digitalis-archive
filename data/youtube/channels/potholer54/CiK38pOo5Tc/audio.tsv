0	6340	Now, scientists say that the earth is 5 billion years old and the Bible says it's 6,000 to
6340	7880	10,000 years old.
7880	10920	So this demonstration is going to prove a big point.
10920	13680	Here's some friendly advice for creationists.
13680	18140	Please before you do something like this and cause atheists to collapse into uncontrollable
18140	23300	laughter, please check with a scientist or a science major or perhaps a 7-year-old who's
23300	27940	just started learning science in elementary school and find out why whatever theory you've
27940	32300	dreamed up at the end of a spade doesn't work in the real world.
32300	38620	So you may wonder why digging a hole is going to help Frank here debunk 200 years of geology.
38620	43140	So let's fast forward.
43140	48060	As you're starting to see the clean soil come up.
48060	50440	Get on with it.
50440	57400	If you notice, you'll see the dirty soil that's on the top and below you start to see
57400	60340	the soil come clean.
60340	68120	If the earth is 5 billion years old, this dark mulch should be 10, 20, 30 feet thick.
68120	69980	It's not even a foot.
69980	71800	How is the earth 5 billion years old?
71800	75480	It's the biggest bullshit ever told to man.
75480	78600	Oh, that's it.
78600	79600	Right.
79600	80600	Well, where do I start?
80600	81600	Okay.
81600	83840	Let's start with what Frank calls dirty soil.
83840	88440	I think he's referring to topsoil or humus, which is where weathered rock is mixed with
88440	89780	organic material.
89780	97320	If the earth is 5 billion years old, this dark mulch should be 10, 20, 30 feet thick.
97320	98320	Okay.
98320	102220	That means that for whatever reason, Frank thinks topsoil accumulates at the rate on
102220	106340	average of one foot every 250 million years.
106340	111000	That would make this layer 250 million years old then, right, Frank?
111000	112800	According to your reckoning.
112800	117800	So although Frank thought he was trying to prove that the earth is just 6,500 years old,
117800	120000	his own math has tripped him up.
120000	125020	But it doesn't matter because topsoil doesn't accumulate like that anyway, at least in what
125020	127740	the rest of us call real life.
127740	132800	In real life, topsoil is by definition always going to be at the top because that's where
132800	136040	organic matter is mixing in with the soil.
136040	141080	Now it does vary in depth because it's always being eroded on higher slopes and accumulating
141080	145000	in alluvial plains and eventually dumped at sea.
145000	150360	As the soil gets eroded, new soil is being produced by weathering at the rock face.
150360	154920	When ice sheets extend across the higher latitudes, as they have done several times in the last
154920	158520	million years, the soil is scraped away completely.
158520	162360	It's replaced by new soil every time there's an interglacial.
162360	167480	Of course this constant weathering into new soil grinds mountains down, so when sea levels
167480	173000	rise and cover this eroded landscape with sediment, the old soil gets buried.
173000	175440	Over time it becomes fossilised.
175440	181040	We can see these so-called paleosoils in a place that the rest of us call the real world.
181040	186340	You can even see ancient worm casts and fossilised plant roots in these paleosoils.
186340	190540	So geologically speaking, soils aren't that old.
190540	195700	But the biggest problem I have with Frank's theory is the injuries we might sustain laughing
195700	199640	at a desperate creationist digging himself into a hole.
199640	201940	And Frank isn't the only culprit.
201940	209580	So this video is an appeal to creationists, please stop, you're killing us.
209580	213300	Over the centuries you've tortured, burned and massacred people who don't accept your
213300	219140	beliefs and I hope that in the 21st century this would have stopped, but no, I've been
219140	224700	getting messages from my subscribers who say they've been seriously hurt or incapacitated
224700	228980	while laughing at your creationist claims.
228980	234160	Rage Unchained, for example, laughed so much at Kent Hovind's claim about carbon dating
234160	237180	that his anal sphincter became detached.
237180	241700	Here's an appeal from a desperate Eorgorinkon with a dire prediction.
241700	246900	Sadly he passed away last month after watching another Ken Ham video.
246900	251380	The list of injuries because of your hilarious statements goes on and on.
251380	258740	An injured jaw, headaches, loss of bladder control, aching muscles.
258740	263620	A number of people even experienced spontaneous combustors nostrallis thanks to Richard Kent
263620	269500	and his dragon claim, including Jacob Paprotsky, who sent me this photo.
269500	273980	Doctors say he'll never again be able to breathe properly or bear children.
273980	278300	Facetious Badger was seriously injured when coffee spat out of his nose.
278300	280700	Now he's suing me for a replacement keyboard.
280700	284740	Does the agony never end?
284740	286700	Now I know what you're going to say, creationists.
286700	291780	It's my mocking, scoffing derision of the things you say that's funny, not you.
291780	297180	It's my fault that so many decent, honest atheists are splitting their sides, or worse,
297180	298820	dying of laughter.
298820	301420	But no, it's not me, it's you.
301420	304820	What you say is genuinely funny.
304820	309540	Now you may argue, well, atheism's pretty funny too, and creationists therefore face
309540	311680	a similar danger to their health.
311680	316140	I'm sorry, but if that was true, then you'd be able to make an amusing video out of something
316140	320020	atheists have said, or something that's accepted science.
320020	321020	But you can't.
321020	326100	Here, for example, is a Golden Crocoduck-nominated video that ought to be funny, because it's
326100	328620	called Atheism is Funny.
328620	331940	Well, let the hilarity begin.
331940	334020	You know, atheism is funny.
334020	335580	How funny is it?
335580	343200	Proponents of atheism laugh at us Christians for believing in the Bible, yet they themselves
343200	349780	completely ignore the fact that they take a fifth grader's science book as infallible
349780	351420	as well.
351420	354620	Hmm, anyone find that funny?
354620	358640	Okay, a creationist does.
358640	364060	The reason no one else is laughing is obvious, because atheists don't think a fifth grader's
364060	365980	science book is infallible.
365980	372040	I mean, by definition, no science book is infallible, because science isn't infallible.
372040	377700	Scientific knowledge is constantly being updated and corrected as new evidence comes along.
377700	379700	And the video gets sillier.
379700	384780	They also regard flesh and blood as infallible.
384780	389220	Here is just a small list of infallible atheists.
389220	390780	Number one, Richard Dawkins.
390780	393420	Richard Dawkins is infallible?
393420	396540	Even Richard Dawkins wouldn't claim he's infallible.
396540	400620	And if he did claim he was infallible, then he'd obviously be wrong.
400620	403540	And if he's wrong, then he can't be infallible.
403540	405500	I suppose that's funny.
405500	410820	Similarly, it's hard to see the joke in this attempt at humour by Ray, the Chuckle King,
410820	411820	Comfort.
411820	415940	Let's now join our correspondent live in the swamps of Gobble Epus.
415940	422860	This amazing animal looks like a duck, but it has the head of some sort of amphibian.
422860	425340	This is tremendously exciting.
425340	427620	Darwin would have been ecstatic.
427620	433860	It's a crocodile that has evolved into a duck, or perhaps a duck that has evolved into a
433860	434860	crocodile.
434860	440860	This almost cute little creature is so close, I could even reach out and touch it.
453860	459820	But as Comfort accepts in the same video, biologists don't believe this creationist
459820	461940	invention ever existed.
461940	463620	So where's the joke?
463620	468820	See, observable humour like this is about observing something that's real.
468820	473540	For example, Jerry Seinfeld made a joke wondering why skydivers wear crash helmets.
473540	482300	In regards to the skydiving, what is the point of the helmet in the skydiving?
482740	489620	Yeah, it's a funny observation because skydivers really do wear crash helmets.
489620	493620	If you'd made a joke about the fact that skydivers wear ballet shoes, you know, something
493620	498360	like what are they hoping to do a pirouette when they land, that wouldn't be funny because
498360	502020	obviously skydivers don't wear ballet shoes.
502020	503020	Get it?
503020	508340	Creationists, what makes your beliefs so debilitatingly funny is that you do believe your book is
508340	509340	infallible.
509380	514120	A lot of you do think there ought to be such a thing as a crocoduck in the theory of evolution.
514120	519060	So trying to apply these attributes to atheism or science only points to the fact that atheism
519060	522520	and science don't have any of these wacky beliefs.
522520	526180	That's what makes what we say so inherently unfunny.
526180	529960	To see if someone's managed to get a laugh out of what atheists actually believe and
529960	534900	what science really says, I had to turn, of course, to Conservopedia.
534900	539580	You may have something that sounds promisingly funny, Top 10 Telltale Signs You're On Your
539580	542420	Way To Being A Lonely Atheist Nerd.
542420	547300	So a warning, you may split your sides and experience incontinence reading what promises
547300	549300	to be a hilarious list.
561300	564660	Top 10 Telltale Signs You're On Your Way To Being A Lonely Atheist Nerd.
564660	569060	Number one, when you're at your girlfriend's house, you can't stop scowling at her mother's
569060	570620	picture of Jesus.
570620	573220	Please see the atheist and evolutionist helpline.
573220	575760	Ooh, tough crowd.
575760	578100	You own more pocket protectors than shirts.
578100	581940	Oh, come on, that was a bit funny.
581940	586180	You tell your girlfriend that she's merely the result of blind, random, natural forces
586180	588480	and there's nothing particularly special about her.
588480	592460	Of course, this lets her know that you're an insensitive liar and she starts crying.
593460	596100	Hmm.
596100	599100	Not so much funny as, well, a bit sad.
599100	603220	Number four, you spent countless hours arguing with your girlfriend on the true definition
603220	608820	of atheism and insist that you're not diluting the definition of atheism given in most encyclopedias
608820	609820	of philosophy.
609820	612820	Oh, someone thinks that's funny.
612820	613820	Wow.
613820	618980	Oh, it's only Ian Juby and he's just chuckling at one of his own atheist jokes.
618980	621980	So okay, let's take a look at that one.
622500	626060	Juby's been reading from a science website explaining a paper about why men are hairier
626060	627180	than women.
627180	632220	The researchers did experiments showing that ectoparasites are more easily detected because
632220	637740	a fine covering of hair makes it more difficult for the parasites to get to exposed skin.
637740	642940	And that means they take longer to crawl around and will be more easily detected.
642940	648300	The conclusion is that hairier men will have fewer parasites and therefore be healthier.
648300	652860	Now there is such a thing as sexual selection, which was actually an old Darwinist idea,
652860	657380	that women, as most men know, are very picky about who they have sex with.
657380	662860	And naturally they go for men who are healthier and more likely to produce healthy offspring.
662860	664900	Or as the website puts it,
664900	669300	Not surprisingly, men were better at detecting bedbugs on the unshaved arm due to having
669300	671540	thicker and longer hair than women.
671540	675680	As to why men are generally hairier looking than women, the researchers suggest it might
675680	680520	be due to something as simple as women preferring men with fewer parasites on them, which would
680520	682680	imply more hair.
682680	686360	Quite interesting, you would have thought, and not particularly funny.
686360	689200	But here's Ian Juby's take on it.
689200	694380	As to why men are generally hairier looking than women, the researchers suggest it might
694380	701240	be due to something as simple as women preferring men with fewer parasites on them, which would
701240	702720	imply more hair.
702720	703720	Wow.
704600	706480	OK Ian, here's the problem.
706480	711600	You can't make something funny just by giggling as you read it, because it mentions body hair,
711600	714920	sex and armpits, unless you're in fifth grade.
714920	718480	You actually get much more of a laugh when you're trying to be serious.
718480	723200	Let's say the sun is orbiting around the earth, then it's going to, over time, it's going
723200	727240	to get out of balance, and it's going to switch places.
727240	730240	But apparently, lay the eggs on the run.
730240	732800	Ian, that's incredible.
732800	738680	But it's this kind of harmful hilarity I'm trying to stop, for the sake of my subscribers.
738680	742400	Finally, onto cartoons, which aren't that much better.
742400	744720	Here's another joke from Conservopedia.
744720	748480	Waitress says, you want proof and evidence that atheism is true?
748480	751760	Nobody has ever asked for that at our atheist restaurant before.
751760	755920	If you're seeking a full course meal of proof and evidence, I suggest going to the Christian
755920	757880	restaurant down the street.
757880	761560	Look, I sympathise.
761560	765240	It's hard to make atheism or scientific facts funny.
765240	767040	Now I know what you're going to say.
767040	768360	But humour is subjective.
768360	773120	I found that cartoon funny, and when Juby giggled at hairy armpits, I cracked up.
773120	774120	You're sincerely Ken Ham.
774120	775680	Oop, what a giveaway.
775680	778420	No, this is more than subjective.
778420	784000	When I searched the term creationist comedian on YouTube, I couldn't find a single one.
784000	787940	There are Christian comedians, but their jokes are all directed at funny things that happen
787940	789720	in churches.
789720	794400	Let's face it, evolution isn't inherently funny, because it just involves organisms
794400	800120	changing slowly over time, through a mechanism we basically understand, and even creationists
800120	802960	accept that they change over time.
802960	807960	Atheists don't have talking snakes, or people springing to life out of lumps of clay, or
807960	814480	ribs, or living inside whales, or weird doctrines that we're forced to follow.
814480	824400	Living women must be shunned, but that, if nothing else, is proof of God's wisdom.
824400	835200	This survey of American beliefs showed that Americans, at a rate of between 48 and 51%,
835200	845960	don't believe in evolution, which is, like, half.
845960	851880	And on top of that 50-odd percent, a further 38 to 40% of Americans believe that biological
851880	856340	evolution has occurred, but believe that it was initiated by, and has since been kind
856340	878300	of administered by, God, leaving a very small percentage of Americans who are right.
878300	880420	It's not my theory.
880420	884340	I've done material about evolution before, and in Australia and in Britain it barely
884340	885340	raises an eyebrow.
885340	886340	It's just worth a chuckle.
886340	890340	But in America it's quite contentious to do comedy about evolution, you know.
890340	891340	It gets a gasp.
891340	895020	It's the equivalent of doing material about fisting anywhere else, you know.
895020	901260	Now on my channel, of course, I couldn't care less about your private beliefs.
901260	902720	You're welcome to them.
902720	907980	The life-threatening laughter here is because of your attempts to marry 21st century science,
907980	913140	or even 16th century science, with the beliefs of people whose most advanced technology was
913140	915460	the open-toed sandal.
915460	919620	It's the ludicrous things you come up with to try to explain it all.
919620	924620	So please, creationists, believe what you like, but stop with the pseudoscience.
924620	926780	Stop being so hysterically funny.
926780	929140	Seriously, you're killing us.
929140	934460	Now how could all that vegetable material be laid down there, and yet this tree trunk
934460	935940	is going through it?
935940	940540	Behold, the atheist's nightmare.
940540	945340	If you're asking me, I firmly believe that the world is getting ready for the tribulation.
945340	950900	Well, what would happen as that poor dinosaur was breathing heavily in and out through those
950900	951900	very narrow nostrils?
951900	956040	Well, I'm telling you what would happen is the nostrils would catch on fire.
956040	963820	If the earth is five billion years old, this dark mulch should be 10, 20, 30 feet thick.
963820	965660	It's not even a foot.
965660	967540	How is the earth five billion years old?
967540	969860	It's the biggest bullshit ever told to man.
969860	970940	Can you imagine that?
