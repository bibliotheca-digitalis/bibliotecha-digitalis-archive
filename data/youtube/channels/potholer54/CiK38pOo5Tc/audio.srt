1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,340
Now, scientists say that the earth is 5 billion years old and the Bible says it's 6,000 to

2
00:00:06,340 --> 00:00:07,880
10,000 years old.

3
00:00:07,880 --> 00:00:10,920
So this demonstration is going to prove a big point.

4
00:00:10,920 --> 00:00:13,680
Here's some friendly advice for creationists.

5
00:00:13,680 --> 00:00:18,140
Please before you do something like this and cause atheists to collapse into uncontrollable

6
00:00:18,140 --> 00:00:23,300
laughter, please check with a scientist or a science major or perhaps a 7-year-old who's

7
00:00:23,300 --> 00:00:27,940
just started learning science in elementary school and find out why whatever theory you've

8
00:00:27,940 --> 00:00:32,300
dreamed up at the end of a spade doesn't work in the real world.

9
00:00:32,300 --> 00:00:38,620
So you may wonder why digging a hole is going to help Frank here debunk 200 years of geology.

10
00:00:38,620 --> 00:00:43,140
So let's fast forward.

11
00:00:43,140 --> 00:00:48,060
As you're starting to see the clean soil come up.

12
00:00:48,060 --> 00:00:50,440
Get on with it.

13
00:00:50,440 --> 00:00:57,400
If you notice, you'll see the dirty soil that's on the top and below you start to see

14
00:00:57,400 --> 00:01:00,340
the soil come clean.

15
00:01:00,340 --> 00:01:08,120
If the earth is 5 billion years old, this dark mulch should be 10, 20, 30 feet thick.

16
00:01:08,120 --> 00:01:09,980
It's not even a foot.

17
00:01:09,980 --> 00:01:11,800
How is the earth 5 billion years old?

18
00:01:11,800 --> 00:01:15,480
It's the biggest bullshit ever told to man.

19
00:01:15,480 --> 00:01:18,600
Oh, that's it.

20
00:01:18,600 --> 00:01:19,600
Right.

21
00:01:19,600 --> 00:01:20,600
Well, where do I start?

22
00:01:20,600 --> 00:01:21,600
Okay.

23
00:01:21,600 --> 00:01:23,840
Let's start with what Frank calls dirty soil.

24
00:01:23,840 --> 00:01:28,440
I think he's referring to topsoil or humus, which is where weathered rock is mixed with

25
00:01:28,440 --> 00:01:29,780
organic material.

26
00:01:29,780 --> 00:01:37,320
If the earth is 5 billion years old, this dark mulch should be 10, 20, 30 feet thick.

27
00:01:37,320 --> 00:01:38,320
Okay.

28
00:01:38,320 --> 00:01:42,220
That means that for whatever reason, Frank thinks topsoil accumulates at the rate on

29
00:01:42,220 --> 00:01:46,340
average of one foot every 250 million years.

30
00:01:46,340 --> 00:01:51,000
That would make this layer 250 million years old then, right, Frank?

31
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:52,800
According to your reckoning.

32
00:01:52,800 --> 00:01:57,800
So although Frank thought he was trying to prove that the earth is just 6,500 years old,

33
00:01:57,800 --> 00:02:00,000
his own math has tripped him up.

34
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:05,020
But it doesn't matter because topsoil doesn't accumulate like that anyway, at least in what

35
00:02:05,020 --> 00:02:07,740
the rest of us call real life.

36
00:02:07,740 --> 00:02:12,800
In real life, topsoil is by definition always going to be at the top because that's where

37
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:16,040
organic matter is mixing in with the soil.

38
00:02:16,040 --> 00:02:21,080
Now it does vary in depth because it's always being eroded on higher slopes and accumulating

39
00:02:21,080 --> 00:02:25,000
in alluvial plains and eventually dumped at sea.

40
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:30,360
As the soil gets eroded, new soil is being produced by weathering at the rock face.

41
00:02:30,360 --> 00:02:34,920
When ice sheets extend across the higher latitudes, as they have done several times in the last

42
00:02:34,920 --> 00:02:38,520
million years, the soil is scraped away completely.

43
00:02:38,520 --> 00:02:42,360
It's replaced by new soil every time there's an interglacial.

44
00:02:42,360 --> 00:02:47,480
Of course this constant weathering into new soil grinds mountains down, so when sea levels

45
00:02:47,480 --> 00:02:53,000
rise and cover this eroded landscape with sediment, the old soil gets buried.

46
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:55,440
Over time it becomes fossilised.

47
00:02:55,440 --> 00:03:01,040
We can see these so-called paleosoils in a place that the rest of us call the real world.

48
00:03:01,040 --> 00:03:06,340
You can even see ancient worm casts and fossilised plant roots in these paleosoils.

49
00:03:06,340 --> 00:03:10,540
So geologically speaking, soils aren't that old.

50
00:03:10,540 --> 00:03:15,700
But the biggest problem I have with Frank's theory is the injuries we might sustain laughing

51
00:03:15,700 --> 00:03:19,640
at a desperate creationist digging himself into a hole.

52
00:03:19,640 --> 00:03:21,940
And Frank isn't the only culprit.

53
00:03:21,940 --> 00:03:29,580
So this video is an appeal to creationists, please stop, you're killing us.

54
00:03:29,580 --> 00:03:33,300
Over the centuries you've tortured, burned and massacred people who don't accept your

55
00:03:33,300 --> 00:03:39,140
beliefs and I hope that in the 21st century this would have stopped, but no, I've been

56
00:03:39,140 --> 00:03:44,700
getting messages from my subscribers who say they've been seriously hurt or incapacitated

57
00:03:44,700 --> 00:03:48,980
while laughing at your creationist claims.

58
00:03:48,980 --> 00:03:54,160
Rage Unchained, for example, laughed so much at Kent Hovind's claim about carbon dating

59
00:03:54,160 --> 00:03:57,180
that his anal sphincter became detached.

60
00:03:57,180 --> 00:04:01,700
Here's an appeal from a desperate Eorgorinkon with a dire prediction.

61
00:04:01,700 --> 00:04:06,900
Sadly he passed away last month after watching another Ken Ham video.

62
00:04:06,900 --> 00:04:11,380
The list of injuries because of your hilarious statements goes on and on.

63
00:04:11,380 --> 00:04:18,740
An injured jaw, headaches, loss of bladder control, aching muscles.

64
00:04:18,740 --> 00:04:23,620
A number of people even experienced spontaneous combustors nostrallis thanks to Richard Kent

65
00:04:23,620 --> 00:04:29,500
and his dragon claim, including Jacob Paprotsky, who sent me this photo.

66
00:04:29,500 --> 00:04:33,980
Doctors say he'll never again be able to breathe properly or bear children.

67
00:04:33,980 --> 00:04:38,300
Facetious Badger was seriously injured when coffee spat out of his nose.

68
00:04:38,300 --> 00:04:40,700
Now he's suing me for a replacement keyboard.

69
00:04:40,700 --> 00:04:44,740
Does the agony never end?

70
00:04:44,740 --> 00:04:46,700
Now I know what you're going to say, creationists.

71
00:04:46,700 --> 00:04:51,780
It's my mocking, scoffing derision of the things you say that's funny, not you.

72
00:04:51,780 --> 00:04:57,180
It's my fault that so many decent, honest atheists are splitting their sides, or worse,

73
00:04:57,180 --> 00:04:58,820
dying of laughter.

74
00:04:58,820 --> 00:05:01,420
But no, it's not me, it's you.

75
00:05:01,420 --> 00:05:04,820
What you say is genuinely funny.

76
00:05:04,820 --> 00:05:09,540
Now you may argue, well, atheism's pretty funny too, and creationists therefore face

77
00:05:09,540 --> 00:05:11,680
a similar danger to their health.

78
00:05:11,680 --> 00:05:16,140
I'm sorry, but if that was true, then you'd be able to make an amusing video out of something

79
00:05:16,140 --> 00:05:20,020
atheists have said, or something that's accepted science.

80
00:05:20,020 --> 00:05:21,020
But you can't.

81
00:05:21,020 --> 00:05:26,100
Here, for example, is a Golden Crocoduck-nominated video that ought to be funny, because it's

82
00:05:26,100 --> 00:05:28,620
called Atheism is Funny.

83
00:05:28,620 --> 00:05:31,940
Well, let the hilarity begin.

84
00:05:31,940 --> 00:05:34,020
You know, atheism is funny.

85
00:05:34,020 --> 00:05:35,580
How funny is it?

86
00:05:35,580 --> 00:05:43,200
Proponents of atheism laugh at us Christians for believing in the Bible, yet they themselves

87
00:05:43,200 --> 00:05:49,780
completely ignore the fact that they take a fifth grader's science book as infallible

88
00:05:49,780 --> 00:05:51,420
as well.

89
00:05:51,420 --> 00:05:54,620
Hmm, anyone find that funny?

90
00:05:54,620 --> 00:05:58,640
Okay, a creationist does.

91
00:05:58,640 --> 00:06:04,060
The reason no one else is laughing is obvious, because atheists don't think a fifth grader's

92
00:06:04,060 --> 00:06:05,980
science book is infallible.

93
00:06:05,980 --> 00:06:12,040
I mean, by definition, no science book is infallible, because science isn't infallible.

94
00:06:12,040 --> 00:06:17,700
Scientific knowledge is constantly being updated and corrected as new evidence comes along.

95
00:06:17,700 --> 00:06:19,700
And the video gets sillier.

96
00:06:19,700 --> 00:06:24,780
They also regard flesh and blood as infallible.

97
00:06:24,780 --> 00:06:29,220
Here is just a small list of infallible atheists.

98
00:06:29,220 --> 00:06:30,780
Number one, Richard Dawkins.

99
00:06:30,780 --> 00:06:33,420
Richard Dawkins is infallible?

100
00:06:33,420 --> 00:06:36,540
Even Richard Dawkins wouldn't claim he's infallible.

101
00:06:36,540 --> 00:06:40,620
And if he did claim he was infallible, then he'd obviously be wrong.

102
00:06:40,620 --> 00:06:43,540
And if he's wrong, then he can't be infallible.

103
00:06:43,540 --> 00:06:45,500
I suppose that's funny.

104
00:06:45,500 --> 00:06:50,820
Similarly, it's hard to see the joke in this attempt at humour by Ray, the Chuckle King,

105
00:06:50,820 --> 00:06:51,820
Comfort.

106
00:06:51,820 --> 00:06:55,940
Let's now join our correspondent live in the swamps of Gobble Epus.

107
00:06:55,940 --> 00:07:02,860
This amazing animal looks like a duck, but it has the head of some sort of amphibian.

108
00:07:02,860 --> 00:07:05,340
This is tremendously exciting.

109
00:07:05,340 --> 00:07:07,620
Darwin would have been ecstatic.

110
00:07:07,620 --> 00:07:13,860
It's a crocodile that has evolved into a duck, or perhaps a duck that has evolved into a

111
00:07:13,860 --> 00:07:14,860
crocodile.

112
00:07:14,860 --> 00:07:20,860
This almost cute little creature is so close, I could even reach out and touch it.

113
00:07:33,860 --> 00:07:39,820
But as Comfort accepts in the same video, biologists don't believe this creationist

114
00:07:39,820 --> 00:07:41,940
invention ever existed.

115
00:07:41,940 --> 00:07:43,620
So where's the joke?

116
00:07:43,620 --> 00:07:48,820
See, observable humour like this is about observing something that's real.

117
00:07:48,820 --> 00:07:53,540
For example, Jerry Seinfeld made a joke wondering why skydivers wear crash helmets.

118
00:07:53,540 --> 00:08:02,300
In regards to the skydiving, what is the point of the helmet in the skydiving?

119
00:08:02,740 --> 00:08:09,620
Yeah, it's a funny observation because skydivers really do wear crash helmets.

120
00:08:09,620 --> 00:08:13,620
If you'd made a joke about the fact that skydivers wear ballet shoes, you know, something

121
00:08:13,620 --> 00:08:18,360
like what are they hoping to do a pirouette when they land, that wouldn't be funny because

122
00:08:18,360 --> 00:08:22,020
obviously skydivers don't wear ballet shoes.

123
00:08:22,020 --> 00:08:23,020
Get it?

124
00:08:23,020 --> 00:08:28,340
Creationists, what makes your beliefs so debilitatingly funny is that you do believe your book is

125
00:08:28,340 --> 00:08:29,340
infallible.

126
00:08:29,380 --> 00:08:34,120
A lot of you do think there ought to be such a thing as a crocoduck in the theory of evolution.

127
00:08:34,120 --> 00:08:39,060
So trying to apply these attributes to atheism or science only points to the fact that atheism

128
00:08:39,060 --> 00:08:42,520
and science don't have any of these wacky beliefs.

129
00:08:42,520 --> 00:08:46,180
That's what makes what we say so inherently unfunny.

130
00:08:46,180 --> 00:08:49,960
To see if someone's managed to get a laugh out of what atheists actually believe and

131
00:08:49,960 --> 00:08:54,900
what science really says, I had to turn, of course, to Conservopedia.

132
00:08:54,900 --> 00:08:59,580
You may have something that sounds promisingly funny, Top 10 Telltale Signs You're On Your

133
00:08:59,580 --> 00:09:02,420
Way To Being A Lonely Atheist Nerd.

134
00:09:02,420 --> 00:09:07,300
So a warning, you may split your sides and experience incontinence reading what promises

135
00:09:07,300 --> 00:09:09,300
to be a hilarious list.

136
00:09:21,300 --> 00:09:24,660
Top 10 Telltale Signs You're On Your Way To Being A Lonely Atheist Nerd.

137
00:09:24,660 --> 00:09:29,060
Number one, when you're at your girlfriend's house, you can't stop scowling at her mother's

138
00:09:29,060 --> 00:09:30,620
picture of Jesus.

139
00:09:30,620 --> 00:09:33,220
Please see the atheist and evolutionist helpline.

140
00:09:33,220 --> 00:09:35,760
Ooh, tough crowd.

141
00:09:35,760 --> 00:09:38,100
You own more pocket protectors than shirts.

142
00:09:38,100 --> 00:09:41,940
Oh, come on, that was a bit funny.

143
00:09:41,940 --> 00:09:46,180
You tell your girlfriend that she's merely the result of blind, random, natural forces

144
00:09:46,180 --> 00:09:48,480
and there's nothing particularly special about her.

145
00:09:48,480 --> 00:09:52,460
Of course, this lets her know that you're an insensitive liar and she starts crying.

146
00:09:53,460 --> 00:09:56,100
Hmm.

147
00:09:56,100 --> 00:09:59,100
Not so much funny as, well, a bit sad.

148
00:09:59,100 --> 00:10:03,220
Number four, you spent countless hours arguing with your girlfriend on the true definition

149
00:10:03,220 --> 00:10:08,820
of atheism and insist that you're not diluting the definition of atheism given in most encyclopedias

150
00:10:08,820 --> 00:10:09,820
of philosophy.

151
00:10:09,820 --> 00:10:12,820
Oh, someone thinks that's funny.

152
00:10:12,820 --> 00:10:13,820
Wow.

153
00:10:13,820 --> 00:10:18,980
Oh, it's only Ian Juby and he's just chuckling at one of his own atheist jokes.

154
00:10:18,980 --> 00:10:21,980
So okay, let's take a look at that one.

155
00:10:22,500 --> 00:10:26,060
Juby's been reading from a science website explaining a paper about why men are hairier

156
00:10:26,060 --> 00:10:27,180
than women.

157
00:10:27,180 --> 00:10:32,220
The researchers did experiments showing that ectoparasites are more easily detected because

158
00:10:32,220 --> 00:10:37,740
a fine covering of hair makes it more difficult for the parasites to get to exposed skin.

159
00:10:37,740 --> 00:10:42,940
And that means they take longer to crawl around and will be more easily detected.

160
00:10:42,940 --> 00:10:48,300
The conclusion is that hairier men will have fewer parasites and therefore be healthier.

161
00:10:48,300 --> 00:10:52,860
Now there is such a thing as sexual selection, which was actually an old Darwinist idea,

162
00:10:52,860 --> 00:10:57,380
that women, as most men know, are very picky about who they have sex with.

163
00:10:57,380 --> 00:11:02,860
And naturally they go for men who are healthier and more likely to produce healthy offspring.

164
00:11:02,860 --> 00:11:04,900
Or as the website puts it,

165
00:11:04,900 --> 00:11:09,300
Not surprisingly, men were better at detecting bedbugs on the unshaved arm due to having

166
00:11:09,300 --> 00:11:11,540
thicker and longer hair than women.

167
00:11:11,540 --> 00:11:15,680
As to why men are generally hairier looking than women, the researchers suggest it might

168
00:11:15,680 --> 00:11:20,520
be due to something as simple as women preferring men with fewer parasites on them, which would

169
00:11:20,520 --> 00:11:22,680
imply more hair.

170
00:11:22,680 --> 00:11:26,360
Quite interesting, you would have thought, and not particularly funny.

171
00:11:26,360 --> 00:11:29,200
But here's Ian Juby's take on it.

172
00:11:29,200 --> 00:11:34,380
As to why men are generally hairier looking than women, the researchers suggest it might

173
00:11:34,380 --> 00:11:41,240
be due to something as simple as women preferring men with fewer parasites on them, which would

174
00:11:41,240 --> 00:11:42,720
imply more hair.

175
00:11:42,720 --> 00:11:43,720
Wow.

176
00:11:44,600 --> 00:11:46,480
OK Ian, here's the problem.

177
00:11:46,480 --> 00:11:51,600
You can't make something funny just by giggling as you read it, because it mentions body hair,

178
00:11:51,600 --> 00:11:54,920
sex and armpits, unless you're in fifth grade.

179
00:11:54,920 --> 00:11:58,480
You actually get much more of a laugh when you're trying to be serious.

180
00:11:58,480 --> 00:12:03,200
Let's say the sun is orbiting around the earth, then it's going to, over time, it's going

181
00:12:03,200 --> 00:12:07,240
to get out of balance, and it's going to switch places.

182
00:12:07,240 --> 00:12:10,240
But apparently, lay the eggs on the run.

183
00:12:10,240 --> 00:12:12,800
Ian, that's incredible.

184
00:12:12,800 --> 00:12:18,680
But it's this kind of harmful hilarity I'm trying to stop, for the sake of my subscribers.

185
00:12:18,680 --> 00:12:22,400
Finally, onto cartoons, which aren't that much better.

186
00:12:22,400 --> 00:12:24,720
Here's another joke from Conservopedia.

187
00:12:24,720 --> 00:12:28,480
Waitress says, you want proof and evidence that atheism is true?

188
00:12:28,480 --> 00:12:31,760
Nobody has ever asked for that at our atheist restaurant before.

189
00:12:31,760 --> 00:12:35,920
If you're seeking a full course meal of proof and evidence, I suggest going to the Christian

190
00:12:35,920 --> 00:12:37,880
restaurant down the street.

191
00:12:37,880 --> 00:12:41,560
Look, I sympathise.

192
00:12:41,560 --> 00:12:45,240
It's hard to make atheism or scientific facts funny.

193
00:12:45,240 --> 00:12:47,040
Now I know what you're going to say.

194
00:12:47,040 --> 00:12:48,360
But humour is subjective.

195
00:12:48,360 --> 00:12:53,120
I found that cartoon funny, and when Juby giggled at hairy armpits, I cracked up.

196
00:12:53,120 --> 00:12:54,120
You're sincerely Ken Ham.

197
00:12:54,120 --> 00:12:55,680
Oop, what a giveaway.

198
00:12:55,680 --> 00:12:58,420
No, this is more than subjective.

199
00:12:58,420 --> 00:13:04,000
When I searched the term creationist comedian on YouTube, I couldn't find a single one.

200
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:07,940
There are Christian comedians, but their jokes are all directed at funny things that happen

201
00:13:07,940 --> 00:13:09,720
in churches.

202
00:13:09,720 --> 00:13:14,400
Let's face it, evolution isn't inherently funny, because it just involves organisms

203
00:13:14,400 --> 00:13:20,120
changing slowly over time, through a mechanism we basically understand, and even creationists

204
00:13:20,120 --> 00:13:22,960
accept that they change over time.

205
00:13:22,960 --> 00:13:27,960
Atheists don't have talking snakes, or people springing to life out of lumps of clay, or

206
00:13:27,960 --> 00:13:34,480
ribs, or living inside whales, or weird doctrines that we're forced to follow.

207
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:44,400
Living women must be shunned, but that, if nothing else, is proof of God's wisdom.

208
00:13:44,400 --> 00:13:55,200
This survey of American beliefs showed that Americans, at a rate of between 48 and 51%,

209
00:13:55,200 --> 00:14:05,960
don't believe in evolution, which is, like, half.

210
00:14:05,960 --> 00:14:11,880
And on top of that 50-odd percent, a further 38 to 40% of Americans believe that biological

211
00:14:11,880 --> 00:14:16,340
evolution has occurred, but believe that it was initiated by, and has since been kind

212
00:14:16,340 --> 00:14:38,300
of administered by, God, leaving a very small percentage of Americans who are right.

213
00:14:38,300 --> 00:14:40,420
It's not my theory.

214
00:14:40,420 --> 00:14:44,340
I've done material about evolution before, and in Australia and in Britain it barely

215
00:14:44,340 --> 00:14:45,340
raises an eyebrow.

216
00:14:45,340 --> 00:14:46,340
It's just worth a chuckle.

217
00:14:46,340 --> 00:14:50,340
But in America it's quite contentious to do comedy about evolution, you know.

218
00:14:50,340 --> 00:14:51,340
It gets a gasp.

219
00:14:51,340 --> 00:14:55,020
It's the equivalent of doing material about fisting anywhere else, you know.

220
00:14:55,020 --> 00:15:01,260
Now on my channel, of course, I couldn't care less about your private beliefs.

221
00:15:01,260 --> 00:15:02,720
You're welcome to them.

222
00:15:02,720 --> 00:15:07,980
The life-threatening laughter here is because of your attempts to marry 21st century science,

223
00:15:07,980 --> 00:15:13,140
or even 16th century science, with the beliefs of people whose most advanced technology was

224
00:15:13,140 --> 00:15:15,460
the open-toed sandal.

225
00:15:15,460 --> 00:15:19,620
It's the ludicrous things you come up with to try to explain it all.

226
00:15:19,620 --> 00:15:24,620
So please, creationists, believe what you like, but stop with the pseudoscience.

227
00:15:24,620 --> 00:15:26,780
Stop being so hysterically funny.

228
00:15:26,780 --> 00:15:29,140
Seriously, you're killing us.

229
00:15:29,140 --> 00:15:34,460
Now how could all that vegetable material be laid down there, and yet this tree trunk

230
00:15:34,460 --> 00:15:35,940
is going through it?

231
00:15:35,940 --> 00:15:40,540
Behold, the atheist's nightmare.

232
00:15:40,540 --> 00:15:45,340
If you're asking me, I firmly believe that the world is getting ready for the tribulation.

233
00:15:45,340 --> 00:15:50,900
Well, what would happen as that poor dinosaur was breathing heavily in and out through those

234
00:15:50,900 --> 00:15:51,900
very narrow nostrils?

235
00:15:51,900 --> 00:15:56,040
Well, I'm telling you what would happen is the nostrils would catch on fire.

236
00:15:56,040 --> 00:16:03,820
If the earth is five billion years old, this dark mulch should be 10, 20, 30 feet thick.

237
00:16:03,820 --> 00:16:05,660
It's not even a foot.

238
00:16:05,660 --> 00:16:07,540
How is the earth five billion years old?

239
00:16:07,540 --> 00:16:09,860
It's the biggest bullshit ever told to man.

240
00:16:09,860 --> 00:16:10,940
Can you imagine that?
