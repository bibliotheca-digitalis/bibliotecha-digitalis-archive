1
00:00:00,720 --> 00:00:05,280
Anyone who's followed my channel knows that it's about busting scientific myths

2
00:00:05,280 --> 00:00:10,640
that pervade the media, often repeated by other media users and even politicians.

3
00:00:10,640 --> 00:00:15,280
Well it's right there in the channel description. It's even more dangerous when the people who

4
00:00:15,280 --> 00:00:20,160
believe all this junk science are not just politicians, but heads of state with the

5
00:00:20,160 --> 00:00:25,920
power to base their policy decisions on that misinformation. Unfortunately, most of the

6
00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:31,200
examples I've given in my videos have been either politicians in the legislature,

7
00:00:31,200 --> 00:00:37,680
or the heads of government far, far away. So when the president of Zambia believes internet myths

8
00:00:37,680 --> 00:00:42,720
that GMOs are poisonous, or when the president of South Africa refused to give treatment to

9
00:00:42,720 --> 00:00:49,200
AIDS sufferers because he believed internet myths that HIV doesn't cause AIDS, these weren't issues

10
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:55,200
that affect most of my subscribers. That's why when the coronavirus pandemic began,

11
00:00:55,200 --> 00:00:59,760
and the misinformation was believed by the president of a country most of my subscribers

12
00:00:59,760 --> 00:01:05,600
come from, and whose decisions would affect them personally, I thought, here's the perfect

13
00:01:05,600 --> 00:01:12,000
opportunity to make my point. This is the finest example of what can happen when not just any

14
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:17,920
politician, but the head of government in your own country trusts the misinformation he sees on

15
00:01:17,920 --> 00:01:27,600
the internet or cable TV ahead of real science. Do you get it now? Unfortunately, I underestimated

16
00:01:27,600 --> 00:01:32,400
just how touchy some people are in the United States about their president. As soon as I

17
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:40,640
mentioned the word Trump, it opened a battle between those who attacked Trump for a host

18
00:01:40,640 --> 00:01:46,160
of things completely unrelated to science, and those who defended him for reasons completely

19
00:01:46,160 --> 00:01:53,760
unrelated to the science. Guys, calm down, get a grip. Interestingly, few of the president's

20
00:01:53,760 --> 00:01:58,560
supporters denied that he'd got the science wrong. Apparently, that wasn't the point.

21
00:01:59,120 --> 00:02:04,240
Some thought it was just plain wrong to correct scientific misinformation coming from politicians.

22
00:02:04,960 --> 00:02:10,080
We should be helping people to trust the administration, and many people got science,

23
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:14,400
the world of facts, confused with politics, which is the world of opinions.

24
00:02:15,280 --> 00:02:21,200
So let me briefly explain. These are all scientific conclusions regarding the pandemic.

25
00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:26,880
So if the leader of the world's most powerful democracy misrepresents these conclusions

26
00:02:26,880 --> 00:02:32,640
because of something he read on the internet or heard on cable TV, then it's important to correct

27
00:02:32,640 --> 00:02:39,280
that, and let people know what the science says, especially during a pandemic. Since I'm correcting

28
00:02:39,280 --> 00:02:44,240
a politician rather than a media pundit, a few people thought that meant it's political

29
00:02:44,240 --> 00:02:50,720
analysis or political science. No, a misrepresentation of science is a science issue,

30
00:02:50,720 --> 00:02:56,880
regardless of who's making it or what the motivation. Just so that some people do understand

31
00:02:56,880 --> 00:03:02,080
the difference, here are the issues that fall under the heading of political science or political

32
00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:09,040
analysis, which are things I don't cover. So, for example, the effectiveness of lockdown on slowing

33
00:03:09,040 --> 00:03:14,800
the spread of a virus, that's a scientific conclusion based on measurements and calculation,

34
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:20,480
which I've covered. Whether or not to impose lockdowns and how severe the restrictions should

35
00:03:20,480 --> 00:03:26,720
be, that's a political decision that I don't cover. But it has to be based on a proper

36
00:03:26,720 --> 00:03:31,920
understanding of the science, so that politicians know the life or death consequences of their

37
00:03:31,920 --> 00:03:38,880
actions. Likewise other topics, like whether restrictions are racist, pandering to China,

38
00:03:38,880 --> 00:03:43,200
opposing the stimulus bill, intelligence committee members who sold all their stock,

39
00:03:43,200 --> 00:03:48,880
these are all political issues that I don't cover on my channel. Whether or not people should go to

40
00:03:48,880 --> 00:03:53,200
Chinatown, or whether you believe it should have been locked down while the rest of the

41
00:03:53,200 --> 00:03:58,080
United States remained open, that's also a matter of opinion and a political decision.

42
00:03:58,960 --> 00:04:03,600
So look, I greatly appreciate these suggestions that I should turn my channel into just another

43
00:04:03,600 --> 00:04:09,120
opinionated political talking shop, simply to avoid confronting a problem you don't want to

44
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:15,440
hear. So here's a better idea, why not simply accept that a politician you admire got the

45
00:04:15,440 --> 00:04:20,640
science wrong? I'm pleased to say that several subscribers do understand the importance of

46
00:04:20,640 --> 00:04:26,880
correcting these errors, whether the politician's on the left or on the right. So to those who still

47
00:04:26,880 --> 00:04:32,240
don't get it, please use the pause button, read the comments, and see how it's done.

48
00:04:32,960 --> 00:04:38,400
It doesn't mean the politician or the pundit or the musician you like and support is wrong

49
00:04:38,400 --> 00:04:42,960
on everything else, or that you should stop admiring them for whatever reason you admire

50
00:04:42,960 --> 00:04:50,000
them. It just means they gave wrong information on some aspect of science. And political, ideological

51
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:56,480
or religious affiliation doesn't matter. And I have no idea where Nicki Minaj and her cousin's

52
00:04:56,480 --> 00:05:02,960
friend's testicles stand on politics. It really doesn't matter. Scientific claptrap is scientific

53
00:05:02,960 --> 00:05:09,680
claptrap. There were all kinds of stuff ups and bad government decisions made during the pandemic.

54
00:05:09,680 --> 00:05:15,680
That's politics. What concerns me is when the stuff ups and bad government decisions

55
00:05:15,680 --> 00:05:21,120
result from government leaders misunderstanding or ignoring science. We've seen it happen to

56
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:25,760
other people from a distance, but last year it started happening much closer to home.

57
00:05:27,200 --> 00:05:33,040
So when I made this video at the start of my Covid series, I was hopeful people would get it now.

58
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:38,960
But it seems the opposite has happened. We've jumped from a conspiracy theory that the virus

59
00:05:38,960 --> 00:05:44,720
was no worse than the flu, to a conspiracy theory that, OK, it's worse than the flu,

60
00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:49,600
but the mounting death toll is due to something else, to conspiracy theories that, OK,

61
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:54,960
the death toll may be due to Covid-19, but 99% of people who get Covid are just fine.

62
00:05:55,840 --> 00:06:00,960
And so on through a number of fallacies, so three quarters of a million deaths later in

63
00:06:00,960 --> 00:06:06,160
the United States and billions of dollars lost in productivity, they still don't get it.

64
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:13,600
There are parallels here with climate change, and that's hardly surprising. Notice any similarity?

65
00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:19,600
First, there was the theory that scientists were conspiring to fake temperature records.

66
00:06:19,920 --> 00:06:25,600
When these phony graphs were exposed, the theory became, OK, temperatures are rising,

67
00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:31,360
but the real cause is the sun. When they finally grasped that solar irradiance was falling,

68
00:06:31,360 --> 00:06:36,640
the conspiracy theory became changed to, OK, that means we're entering a mini ice age.

69
00:06:37,280 --> 00:06:42,800
When we didn't enter a mini ice age, but the planet kept warming, the theory changed to,

70
00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:47,120
OK, it's probably carbon dioxide after all, but warmer weather will be good,

71
00:06:47,120 --> 00:06:50,480
and carbon dioxide is plant food. Life will be wonderful.

72
00:06:51,600 --> 00:06:57,440
Now, with heatwaves in the Arctic region, sea ice shrinking, ice caps melting, glaciers all

73
00:06:57,440 --> 00:07:04,880
over the world retreating, coral reefs dying, wildfires, hurricanes, floods and droughts all

74
00:07:04,880 --> 00:07:09,680
growing more intense, and the futuristic scenes that scientists have been warning about for

75
00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:15,120
decades happening for real on the evening news, I have to ask these people again.

76
00:07:15,840 --> 00:07:21,760
Do you get it now? And if not, what does it take for people to wake up to reality

77
00:07:21,760 --> 00:07:27,360
and stop believing blogs, videos and TV pundits spreading baseless conspiracy theories?

78
00:07:28,080 --> 00:07:33,040
After all, science is by no means perfect, but it does have a pretty good track record

79
00:07:33,040 --> 00:07:38,800
in getting things right. Well, I think the pandemic has finally shown us what it takes.

80
00:07:38,880 --> 00:07:41,680
What percentage would you think have been vaccinated?

81
00:07:41,680 --> 00:07:48,000
Oh, probably less than one percent at any given time.

82
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:52,160
And you don't think you have a social responsibility to encourage them to go and get

83
00:07:52,160 --> 00:07:58,320
vaccinated? We do not. Our job is to preach the gospel of Jesus Christ and preach faith.

84
00:07:59,200 --> 00:08:01,680
Have you been vaccinated? No, sir, I have not.

85
00:08:01,680 --> 00:08:04,000
And will you get vaccinated? No, sir, I won't.

86
00:08:04,560 --> 00:08:08,160
Why? Because I don't trust it and I don't know what's in them.

87
00:08:08,160 --> 00:08:14,400
I was strongly against getting the vaccine just because we're a strong conservative family.

88
00:08:16,880 --> 00:08:22,960
He had heard that the people that were spreading the virus were people that had already had the

89
00:08:22,960 --> 00:08:28,720
vaccine and that that they were carriers. She was telling me not to get vaccinated.

90
00:08:28,720 --> 00:08:34,400
I think it was from misinformation. I think it was from falling into negative social media and

91
00:08:34,960 --> 00:08:37,760
bloggers. I suppose you think I should be saying,

92
00:08:37,760 --> 00:08:44,720
told you so and serves you right. No, I feel so sorry for these people who are no doubt decent

93
00:08:44,720 --> 00:08:50,480
and honest, who have families, but who were fed a diet of misinformation and believed it.

94
00:08:51,360 --> 00:08:54,480
It does, however, answer the question, do you get it now?

95
00:08:55,120 --> 00:09:00,080
Because here the answer is yes, most of these people finally do get it.

96
00:09:00,080 --> 00:09:05,280
As they were innovating her and they'd given her the sedation and the paralytic,

97
00:09:06,080 --> 00:09:10,320
which is standard, her heart just let go. The next day I went and got my vaccination.

98
00:09:11,280 --> 00:09:16,800
I made a terrible mistake. Never should have done it. She'd taken the vaccine.

99
00:09:18,880 --> 00:09:22,960
But that little boy out there already had a vaccine.

100
00:09:23,520 --> 00:09:28,160
And ironically, some of those pundits who spread the misinformation they were listening to

101
00:09:28,160 --> 00:09:33,840
also contracted COVID-19 and died because they were poisoned by the same diet of their own

102
00:09:33,840 --> 00:09:39,760
bullshit. Dick Farrell, a talk radio pundit who urged people not to get vaccinated,

103
00:09:40,400 --> 00:09:46,480
he contracted COVID-19 and died. Scott Apley, a Republican party official

104
00:09:46,480 --> 00:09:52,160
who discouraged many people from getting vaccinated also contracted COVID-19 and died.

105
00:09:52,880 --> 00:09:57,680
And the man who thought the vaccine was unnecessary and recorded this parody song

106
00:09:58,320 --> 00:10:06,480
because of the Vaxman. Phil Valentine contracted COVID-19 and all too late wished he'd got the

107
00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:14,480
vaccine and urged others to do the same. He also died. It's a sad, pointless and unnecessary

108
00:10:14,480 --> 00:10:20,400
waste of life. It's as if we're all falling out of an aeroplane, but some people refuse to release

109
00:10:20,400 --> 00:10:24,960
their parachutes because they read that air resistance is a myth and that acceleration

110
00:10:24,960 --> 00:10:30,400
due to gravity is exaggerated. Prayers don't work. Vaccines do.

111
00:10:31,680 --> 00:10:37,520
So yes, for all the denials and so-called scepticism and ignorance and misinformation

112
00:10:37,520 --> 00:10:41,120
that pervades the internet, people do finally get it,

113
00:10:41,120 --> 00:10:45,920
but only when it affects them personally and when it's far too late.

114
00:10:54,960 --> 00:10:55,460
Thank you.
