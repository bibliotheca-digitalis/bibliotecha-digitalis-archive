720	5280	Anyone who's followed my channel knows that it's about busting scientific myths
5280	10640	that pervade the media, often repeated by other media users and even politicians.
10640	15280	Well it's right there in the channel description. It's even more dangerous when the people who
15280	20160	believe all this junk science are not just politicians, but heads of state with the
20160	25920	power to base their policy decisions on that misinformation. Unfortunately, most of the
25920	31200	examples I've given in my videos have been either politicians in the legislature,
31200	37680	or the heads of government far, far away. So when the president of Zambia believes internet myths
37680	42720	that GMOs are poisonous, or when the president of South Africa refused to give treatment to
42720	49200	AIDS sufferers because he believed internet myths that HIV doesn't cause AIDS, these weren't issues
49200	55200	that affect most of my subscribers. That's why when the coronavirus pandemic began,
55200	59760	and the misinformation was believed by the president of a country most of my subscribers
59760	65600	come from, and whose decisions would affect them personally, I thought, here's the perfect
65600	72000	opportunity to make my point. This is the finest example of what can happen when not just any
72000	77920	politician, but the head of government in your own country trusts the misinformation he sees on
77920	87600	the internet or cable TV ahead of real science. Do you get it now? Unfortunately, I underestimated
87600	92400	just how touchy some people are in the United States about their president. As soon as I
92400	100640	mentioned the word Trump, it opened a battle between those who attacked Trump for a host
100640	106160	of things completely unrelated to science, and those who defended him for reasons completely
106160	113760	unrelated to the science. Guys, calm down, get a grip. Interestingly, few of the president's
113760	118560	supporters denied that he'd got the science wrong. Apparently, that wasn't the point.
119120	124240	Some thought it was just plain wrong to correct scientific misinformation coming from politicians.
124960	130080	We should be helping people to trust the administration, and many people got science,
130080	134400	the world of facts, confused with politics, which is the world of opinions.
135280	141200	So let me briefly explain. These are all scientific conclusions regarding the pandemic.
141840	146880	So if the leader of the world's most powerful democracy misrepresents these conclusions
146880	152640	because of something he read on the internet or heard on cable TV, then it's important to correct
152640	159280	that, and let people know what the science says, especially during a pandemic. Since I'm correcting
159280	164240	a politician rather than a media pundit, a few people thought that meant it's political
164240	170720	analysis or political science. No, a misrepresentation of science is a science issue,
170720	176880	regardless of who's making it or what the motivation. Just so that some people do understand
176880	182080	the difference, here are the issues that fall under the heading of political science or political
182080	189040	analysis, which are things I don't cover. So, for example, the effectiveness of lockdown on slowing
189040	194800	the spread of a virus, that's a scientific conclusion based on measurements and calculation,
194800	200480	which I've covered. Whether or not to impose lockdowns and how severe the restrictions should
200480	206720	be, that's a political decision that I don't cover. But it has to be based on a proper
206720	211920	understanding of the science, so that politicians know the life or death consequences of their
211920	218880	actions. Likewise other topics, like whether restrictions are racist, pandering to China,
218880	223200	opposing the stimulus bill, intelligence committee members who sold all their stock,
223200	228880	these are all political issues that I don't cover on my channel. Whether or not people should go to
228880	233200	Chinatown, or whether you believe it should have been locked down while the rest of the
233200	238080	United States remained open, that's also a matter of opinion and a political decision.
238960	243600	So look, I greatly appreciate these suggestions that I should turn my channel into just another
243600	249120	opinionated political talking shop, simply to avoid confronting a problem you don't want to
249120	255440	hear. So here's a better idea, why not simply accept that a politician you admire got the
255440	260640	science wrong? I'm pleased to say that several subscribers do understand the importance of
260640	266880	correcting these errors, whether the politician's on the left or on the right. So to those who still
266880	272240	don't get it, please use the pause button, read the comments, and see how it's done.
272960	278400	It doesn't mean the politician or the pundit or the musician you like and support is wrong
278400	282960	on everything else, or that you should stop admiring them for whatever reason you admire
282960	290000	them. It just means they gave wrong information on some aspect of science. And political, ideological
290000	296480	or religious affiliation doesn't matter. And I have no idea where Nicki Minaj and her cousin's
296480	302960	friend's testicles stand on politics. It really doesn't matter. Scientific claptrap is scientific
302960	309680	claptrap. There were all kinds of stuff ups and bad government decisions made during the pandemic.
309680	315680	That's politics. What concerns me is when the stuff ups and bad government decisions
315680	321120	result from government leaders misunderstanding or ignoring science. We've seen it happen to
321120	325760	other people from a distance, but last year it started happening much closer to home.
327200	333040	So when I made this video at the start of my Covid series, I was hopeful people would get it now.
334000	338960	But it seems the opposite has happened. We've jumped from a conspiracy theory that the virus
338960	344720	was no worse than the flu, to a conspiracy theory that, OK, it's worse than the flu,
344720	349600	but the mounting death toll is due to something else, to conspiracy theories that, OK,
349600	354960	the death toll may be due to Covid-19, but 99% of people who get Covid are just fine.
355840	360960	And so on through a number of fallacies, so three quarters of a million deaths later in
360960	366160	the United States and billions of dollars lost in productivity, they still don't get it.
367600	373600	There are parallels here with climate change, and that's hardly surprising. Notice any similarity?
375120	379600	First, there was the theory that scientists were conspiring to fake temperature records.
379920	385600	When these phony graphs were exposed, the theory became, OK, temperatures are rising,
385600	391360	but the real cause is the sun. When they finally grasped that solar irradiance was falling,
391360	396640	the conspiracy theory became changed to, OK, that means we're entering a mini ice age.
397280	402800	When we didn't enter a mini ice age, but the planet kept warming, the theory changed to,
402800	407120	OK, it's probably carbon dioxide after all, but warmer weather will be good,
407120	410480	and carbon dioxide is plant food. Life will be wonderful.
411600	417440	Now, with heatwaves in the Arctic region, sea ice shrinking, ice caps melting, glaciers all
417440	424880	over the world retreating, coral reefs dying, wildfires, hurricanes, floods and droughts all
424880	429680	growing more intense, and the futuristic scenes that scientists have been warning about for
429680	435120	decades happening for real on the evening news, I have to ask these people again.
435840	441760	Do you get it now? And if not, what does it take for people to wake up to reality
441760	447360	and stop believing blogs, videos and TV pundits spreading baseless conspiracy theories?
448080	453040	After all, science is by no means perfect, but it does have a pretty good track record
453040	458800	in getting things right. Well, I think the pandemic has finally shown us what it takes.
458880	461680	What percentage would you think have been vaccinated?
461680	468000	Oh, probably less than one percent at any given time.
468000	472160	And you don't think you have a social responsibility to encourage them to go and get
472160	478320	vaccinated? We do not. Our job is to preach the gospel of Jesus Christ and preach faith.
479200	481680	Have you been vaccinated? No, sir, I have not.
481680	484000	And will you get vaccinated? No, sir, I won't.
484560	488160	Why? Because I don't trust it and I don't know what's in them.
488160	494400	I was strongly against getting the vaccine just because we're a strong conservative family.
496880	502960	He had heard that the people that were spreading the virus were people that had already had the
502960	508720	vaccine and that that they were carriers. She was telling me not to get vaccinated.
508720	514400	I think it was from misinformation. I think it was from falling into negative social media and
514960	517760	bloggers. I suppose you think I should be saying,
517760	524720	told you so and serves you right. No, I feel so sorry for these people who are no doubt decent
524720	530480	and honest, who have families, but who were fed a diet of misinformation and believed it.
531360	534480	It does, however, answer the question, do you get it now?
535120	540080	Because here the answer is yes, most of these people finally do get it.
540080	545280	As they were innovating her and they'd given her the sedation and the paralytic,
546080	550320	which is standard, her heart just let go. The next day I went and got my vaccination.
551280	556800	I made a terrible mistake. Never should have done it. She'd taken the vaccine.
558880	562960	But that little boy out there already had a vaccine.
563520	568160	And ironically, some of those pundits who spread the misinformation they were listening to
568160	573840	also contracted COVID-19 and died because they were poisoned by the same diet of their own
573840	579760	bullshit. Dick Farrell, a talk radio pundit who urged people not to get vaccinated,
580400	586480	he contracted COVID-19 and died. Scott Apley, a Republican party official
586480	592160	who discouraged many people from getting vaccinated also contracted COVID-19 and died.
592880	597680	And the man who thought the vaccine was unnecessary and recorded this parody song
598320	606480	because of the Vaxman. Phil Valentine contracted COVID-19 and all too late wished he'd got the
606480	614480	vaccine and urged others to do the same. He also died. It's a sad, pointless and unnecessary
614480	620400	waste of life. It's as if we're all falling out of an aeroplane, but some people refuse to release
620400	624960	their parachutes because they read that air resistance is a myth and that acceleration
624960	630400	due to gravity is exaggerated. Prayers don't work. Vaccines do.
631680	637520	So yes, for all the denials and so-called scepticism and ignorance and misinformation
637520	641120	that pervades the internet, people do finally get it,
641120	645920	but only when it affects them personally and when it's far too late.
654960	655460	Thank you.
