00:00.000 --> 00:05.160
I'm usually rather scathing about climate bloggers, but someone sent me some links to

00:05.160 --> 00:10.120
a number of blogs that convinced me they'd got at least one thing right. There was much

00:10.120 --> 00:15.380
ballyhoo in the media a few years ago when two huge chunks of the Petermann Glacier in

00:15.380 --> 00:20.680
Greenland broke away, and it led to concerns from scientists about an increase in the rate

00:20.680 --> 00:26.920
of melting of Greenland's ice cap. And yet, as the bloggers rightly point out, the glacier

00:26.920 --> 00:33.100
hasn't retreated, it's been advancing. Why can't scientists who study the glacier

00:33.100 --> 00:35.920
see that too? We should all be very concerned about the

00:35.920 --> 00:41.480
fact that our so-called free press and scientists in academia are aligned to us in such a bold

00:41.480 --> 00:43.800
and obvious fashion. Well, that's a bit strong.

00:43.800 --> 00:47.080
The corruption in climate academia is obviously very deep.

00:47.080 --> 00:51.840
Hang on, before I start climbing on board with a conspiracy theory, I need to do a bit

00:51.840 --> 00:56.380
more than just spend five minutes looking at blogs and photos.

00:56.380 --> 01:01.400
The first thing that puzzled me was, since no one disputes the fact that two huge chunks

01:01.400 --> 01:07.100
of ice came away from the Petermann Glacier, why didn't that make a dent in its position?

01:07.100 --> 01:12.740
Why did it move forwards rather than backwards? So I looked more carefully at the timeline

01:12.740 --> 01:18.840
and found more information and then I checked my watch. It had taken only another five minutes

01:18.840 --> 01:25.440
to discover that all these very convincing blogs and videos are talking complete nonsense.

01:25.440 --> 01:31.560
They all show photos of the ice advancing after 2012, which is true. But how come they

01:31.560 --> 01:38.320
never show photos of what happened before 2012? And this is what it looks like. These

01:38.320 --> 01:45.360
red lines mark the outlines of blocks of ice that broke away in 2010 and 2012. So let's

01:45.360 --> 01:49.760
take a closer look at what the blogs aren't showing you.

01:49.760 --> 01:53.840
The Petermann Glacier is in the far north of Greenland and one of the reasons it's

01:53.840 --> 01:59.640
being studied is that it's been pretty stable for over 130 years, since it was first measured

01:59.640 --> 02:07.000
in 1876 until the massive break-up of 2010. As the ice front advances at the rate of about

02:07.000 --> 02:12.880
a kilometre a year, small icebergs are breaking off into the sea or carving, keeping the ice

02:12.880 --> 02:19.240
front pretty much in equilibrium. This is what the ice front looked like in 1999 and

02:19.240 --> 02:26.520
2004 and again in 2010. But around 2008 researchers noticed cracks

02:26.520 --> 02:33.120
beginning to appear and in 2010 something unusual happened. A huge area of ice four

02:33.120 --> 02:39.160
times the size of Manhattan broke away. It was a record. And sure enough the rupture

02:39.160 --> 02:44.880
did cause the ice front to retreat. Then more cracks appeared further upstream

02:44.880 --> 02:50.600
and in 2012 the same thing happened again. This time a double Manhattan sized chunk of

02:50.600 --> 02:57.160
ice separated and again the ice front moved back. Researchers calculated that the break-ups

02:57.160 --> 03:04.240
shortened the glacier in the fjord from 81 kilometres in length to 46 kilometres.

03:04.320 --> 03:10.960
The advance between 2012 and 2019 hasn't even made up for the ice lost in the 2012

03:10.960 --> 03:17.680
break-up, let alone the 2010 break-up. Now more cracks are appearing 12 kilometres even

03:17.680 --> 03:24.840
further upstream, just like the cracks that heralded the 2010 and 2012 break-ups. Researchers

03:24.840 --> 03:30.220
are expecting that another ice island may break away in the next few years. That would

03:30.220 --> 03:35.980
take the ice front back even further. The next thing I checked was why the scientists

03:35.980 --> 03:41.100
were claiming that the ice was not advancing after 2012 when it clearly was.

03:47.820 --> 03:53.700
Good question. Is it really because they're paid to lie about the climate? No, again,

03:53.700 --> 03:58.780
it turns out the bloggers got that wrong too. Firstly, when bloggers make a claim about

03:58.780 --> 04:05.260
what someone said without providing a name or a quote, be sceptical. Experience has shown

04:05.260 --> 04:10.780
me that it usually means they've made it up. I can't find a single instance of a

04:10.780 --> 04:16.460
scientist making that claim and neither can the bloggers. On the contrary, scientists

04:16.460 --> 04:22.540
have openly reported on the advance in the ice since 2012. NASA has posted images of

04:22.540 --> 04:28.060
it online. The advance is mentioned and illustrated in scientific studies. You can even look it

04:28.060 --> 04:33.100
up on Wikipedia. So if the bloggers think they've exposed a scurrilous secret that

04:33.100 --> 04:37.940
scientists are trying to hide, I'm sorry to say that everyone else was way ahead of

04:37.940 --> 04:43.460
you. And they certainly never claimed that the ice was retreating.

04:43.460 --> 04:47.380
Then I noticed something in Tony Heller's video that showed where this idea might have

04:47.380 --> 04:53.020
come from and it's a great insight into how these conspiracy theories get started. I'll

04:53.020 --> 04:58.060
come back to that in a minute. First, it's important to look at why the

04:58.060 --> 05:03.400
Petermann Glacier is behaving like this. After all, you don't see seven years of advance

05:03.400 --> 05:08.820
like this in most of the world's glaciers. They're nearly all retreating.

05:08.820 --> 05:13.660
So here's a bit of background. Outside of tectonic movement, glaciers advance and retreat

05:13.660 --> 05:18.820
according to two main factors. One is the amount of snowfall they receive at the top

05:18.820 --> 05:23.240
in what's called the accumulation zone. The other is the amount of ice that melts

05:23.240 --> 05:29.820
at the bottom, called the ablation zone. The terminus of the glacier is called its foot.

05:29.820 --> 05:35.660
When accumulation and ablation are in balance, the foot of the glacier neither advances or

05:35.660 --> 05:39.740
retreats. In recent decades, the amount of snow accumulating

05:39.740 --> 05:45.380
on glaciers has been outpaced by rapid melting. And the ablation zone has been moving higher

05:45.380 --> 05:50.620
up again because of warmer air temperature. As a result, the feet of most glaciers have

05:50.620 --> 05:56.500
been in constant retreat and certainly haven't been advancing since 2012.

05:56.500 --> 06:03.040
So why is the Petermann Glacier behaving differently? Answer, because none of the photos in any

06:03.040 --> 06:08.540
of the blogs actually show the foot of the Petermann Glacier.

06:08.540 --> 06:13.660
I know, I was as shocked as you are. Turns out I didn't know as much about glaciers as

06:13.660 --> 06:17.900
I thought. Greenland's glaciers aren't like the mountain

06:17.900 --> 06:22.340
glaciers we're familiar with and the ones I've studied. They're continental glaciers,

06:22.340 --> 06:26.940
an extension of the massive Greenland ice sheet. Basically they're an outflow of the

06:26.940 --> 06:33.620
sheet itself. Unlike mountain glaciers, they're tapping into a huge reservoir of ice. And

06:33.620 --> 06:39.020
unlike mountain glaciers that end on land, the Petermann Glacier extends far into the

06:39.020 --> 06:45.300
sea. It continues in contact with bedrock for a short distance, but then it floats and

06:45.300 --> 06:50.860
for most of its length it's an ice shelf known as the Petermann Tongue. So what we're seeing

06:50.860 --> 06:57.420
in all these photos is the edge of the ice shelf, not the foot of the glacier.

06:57.420 --> 07:02.540
This is important because the ice shelf isn't moving under its own weight due to gravity,

07:02.540 --> 07:07.380
like a mountain glacier. What's causing it to move is the force of the descending land

07:07.380 --> 07:12.940
ice behind it. And because the ice shelf is stuck between two rock faces on each side

07:12.940 --> 07:19.780
of a fjord, it resists this movement. Effectively it acts like a break, holding back the outflow

07:19.780 --> 07:23.980
of the ice sheet behind it. Anyone who's lived in a cold climate will

07:23.980 --> 07:29.460
be familiar with the blockage that ice can cause inside a frozen pipe. It impedes the

07:29.460 --> 07:35.680
flow of water. You have to warm the pipe to get the ice to break up and break away. As

07:35.680 --> 07:41.340
chunks of ice come out, the blockage is cleared and the water flows faster.

07:41.340 --> 07:46.680
So this isn't a difficult concept to grasp, and scientists say that's the danger of what's

07:46.680 --> 07:51.880
happening on the Petermann ice shelf. If large chunks of this blockage continue to break

07:51.880 --> 07:58.140
away, the ice will flow more freely and quickly out of the ice sheet, and that will accelerate

07:58.140 --> 08:02.040
sea level rise. That's why scientists have been studying

08:02.040 --> 08:07.720
the velocity of the Petermann glacier since the early 1990s, and that's a measure of how

08:07.720 --> 08:13.360
much ice is flowing. And there was indeed an increase in velocity of the glacier after

08:13.360 --> 08:20.280
the 2012 blockage was removed. We see the ice flowing more freely. In normal times it

08:20.280 --> 08:26.040
takes one step forwards and one step backwards as icebergs carve into the sea. So the small

08:26.040 --> 08:31.360
advance we've seen over the last seven years is not unusual. What's different now is that

08:31.360 --> 08:35.880
it's taking one step forward and seven steps backwards.

08:35.880 --> 08:41.880
There have been large break-offs before, around 1960 and 1991, but what scientists are concerned

08:41.880 --> 08:46.760
about is the fact that the breaks are becoming larger and more frequent. Instead of being

08:46.760 --> 08:51.880
decades apart, the last two were just two years apart, and another rift may already

08:51.880 --> 08:59.200
be forming. And the 2010 break-up was much larger than anything that's been seen before.

08:59.200 --> 09:04.500
The omission of all this crucial detail in the blogs can't be because of ignorance, because

09:04.500 --> 09:10.000
even though the bloggers don't read scientific journals, even the newspapers they cite explain

09:10.000 --> 09:15.960
it. This is from the independent story that Anthony Watts cited on his blog, but didn't

09:15.960 --> 09:21.320
show. And Tony Heller shows the top of the Washington Post story, but cuts it off before

09:21.320 --> 09:27.120
the crucial paragraph that also explains it all, and he replaces it with this tip. You'd

09:27.120 --> 09:33.400
have to be a complete moron to believe anything the Washington Post writes about climate.

09:33.400 --> 09:38.740
I'm no fan of the way the media reports science, as anyone familiar with my channel would know,

09:38.740 --> 09:42.880
but this reference to the Washington Post brings me back to the false claim I showed

09:42.880 --> 09:47.880
earlier. Where did Heller get the idea that scientists claimed the ice was retreating

09:47.880 --> 09:48.880
after 2012?

09:48.880 --> 09:54.480
Why are they claiming that the Petermann glacier has shrunk since the cabin event in 2012?

09:54.480 --> 10:01.320
As I said, that's simply not true. Scientists say clearly that the ice advanced after 2012,

10:01.320 --> 10:06.580
but I think I've figured out how Heller managed to make completely the opposite conclusion.

10:06.580 --> 10:08.620
This is from his video.

10:08.620 --> 10:12.480
So based on the Washington Post article, it would be safe to assume that the ice edge

10:12.480 --> 10:14.740
has retreated since 2012.

10:14.740 --> 10:20.960
But is it safe to assume the Washington Post says that? Well, that's very easy to check.

10:20.960 --> 10:25.040
Let's read the Washington Post story and find out.

10:25.040 --> 10:30.600
It turns out the Washington Post did not claim the ice had been retreating after 2012. In

10:30.600 --> 10:36.120
fact, it had a graphic that clearly showed the advance since 2012, and it even gives

10:36.120 --> 10:42.400
the speed of the advance about one kilometre a year. So the assumption that it said otherwise

10:42.400 --> 10:48.480
is nonsense and could very easily have been checked. Therefore the assumption that a scientist

10:48.480 --> 10:58.240
told the Washington Post this, which then becomes a pluralised fact fed to subscribers,

10:58.240 --> 11:01.520
is completely made up.

11:01.520 --> 11:06.520
Fortunately the people who follow these blogs are all sceptics. So when I read the comments

11:06.520 --> 11:10.840
sections, I discovered that most of them had checked the newspaper stories for themselves

11:10.840 --> 11:15.120
and discovered that the assumptions were wrong and uncovered the complete picture that the

11:15.120 --> 11:20.600
bloggers didn't show. I'm kidding. Of course they didn't do that. They're not the least

11:20.600 --> 11:26.160
bit sceptical. They didn't bother checking any of this. Of course they blindly believe

11:26.160 --> 11:31.520
whatever the bloggers tell them. We're living in an internet world plagued by conspiracy

11:31.520 --> 11:32.520
theories.

11:32.520 --> 11:36.680
Why is it up to me to go do five minutes of research on the NASA website to find out what

11:36.680 --> 11:38.640
a big lie this whole story was?

11:38.640 --> 11:43.080
Well maybe you shouldn't just spend five minutes looking at some photos and decide that you

11:43.080 --> 11:47.520
know more about this than the oceanographers and glaciologists who spend half the year

11:47.520 --> 11:53.400
on the ice shelf studying it. Maybe you should spend more than five minutes on this and read

11:53.400 --> 11:58.800
some of the material you're citing and find out what scientists actually said, rather

11:58.800 --> 12:03.360
than jumping to the conclusion that they must be lying because you assume the only source

12:03.360 --> 12:06.560
you cite says something it doesn't.

12:06.560 --> 12:11.360
That goes for all the bloggers who misrepresented these facts. No one is forcing you to sit

12:11.360 --> 12:18.480
comfortably at home, look at a few photos, misrepresent the science and ask for donations.

12:18.480 --> 12:23.000
After all, it was only after I'd spent five minutes looking at the photos and agreed that

12:23.000 --> 12:29.360
the ice was advancing that I discovered what happened before 2012 and that scientists didn't

12:29.360 --> 12:35.440
lie and claim the ice was retreating after 2012. And after more hours studying the research

12:35.440 --> 12:41.280
material I learned how the velocity of the glacier increased after the 2012 carving and

12:41.280 --> 12:47.040
why that happened and why it's important. And I learned that 80% of the melting is coming

12:47.040 --> 12:51.880
from warmer water underneath the glacier and that recent measurements show the temperature

12:51.880 --> 12:57.160
of that water is increasing. I'm not going to pretend that a few days studying this makes

12:57.160 --> 13:02.680
me any kind of authority, but I do know a lot more than I did when I started out, reading

13:02.680 --> 13:07.640
the blogs and looking at a few photos. There's still a huge amount of information I can't

13:07.640 --> 13:13.280
squeeze into a 16 minute video, and there's still a lot the researchers don't know. That's

13:13.280 --> 13:18.280
why they're not saying that the ice breaks are a sure sign of global warming, contrary

13:18.280 --> 13:25.440
to what the bloggers claim, but they are saying that they're concerned and they explain why.

13:25.440 --> 13:30.100
Maybe we should listen to those concerns and understand the science behind them instead

13:30.100 --> 13:36.300
of believing blogs that deliberately hide the evidence and make up fabricated claims.

13:36.300 --> 13:41.740
So please fact check anything in this video that you're sceptical about. Unlike the bloggers,

13:41.740 --> 13:47.960
I cite all my sources in the video description, so it's easy for you to check. To the conspiracy

13:47.960 --> 13:52.940
theorists out there, if you have to misquote me to find a mistake, or if you can't do any

13:52.940 --> 13:58.980
better than criticise my voice, my attitude or my personality, thanks. I'll take that

13:58.980 --> 14:04.340
as a sign that you've fact checked my video and can't find a single error. But if you

14:04.340 --> 14:10.780
do find a mistake, then of course I'll be happy to issue a correction, as I always do.

14:10.780 --> 14:15.580
I wonder if we'll see the bloggers do the same thing.

14:15.580 --> 14:21.260
Unlike these blogs, my channel isn't monetised and I don't ask for donations, so I've suggested

14:21.260 --> 14:25.680
that if you want to give money to support this channel, please give it to a worthy charity

14:25.680 --> 14:29.300
which is detailed at the top of the video description.

14:29.300 --> 14:32.860
And just to set the record straight for a few people who made assumptions about this

14:32.860 --> 14:38.040
charity and didn't bother to check their facts before posting, ironic given the theme of

14:38.040 --> 14:44.880
this video, this is not a reforestation project and it hasn't been imposed on local people.

14:44.880 --> 14:50.540
It was instigated at their request. The charity has successfully stopped most of the illegal

14:50.540 --> 14:56.420
logging in a national park in Borneo by offering free community medical healthcare in return

14:56.420 --> 15:01.300
for a commitment not to cut down trees, since the main reason people were logging in the

15:01.300 --> 15:06.360
national park was to get money when family members were sick. Payment to the hospital

15:06.360 --> 15:11.060
is made in the form of saplings, which are planted in open spaces of the forest that

15:11.060 --> 15:17.540
had previously been logged. Camera traps show that wildlife is now returning to these areas.

15:17.540 --> 15:23.580
And money from carbon credits for this reforestation pays the salaries of doctors and nurses.

15:23.580 --> 15:29.020
The people get proper healthcare and the forest is being conserved and even restored.

15:29.020 --> 15:33.980
So reforestation is only one element of this model, which thanks to your donations is now

15:33.980 --> 15:39.900
being trialled in Madagascar and Brazil. I'm not connected to the charity, I just did a

15:39.900 --> 15:45.940
story on the project several years ago and was hugely impressed. So when people started

15:45.980 --> 15:51.820
asking if they could donate to my channel, I told them to donate here instead. And thanks

15:51.820 --> 15:53.100
to all of those who did.
