0	5160	I'm usually rather scathing about climate bloggers, but someone sent me some links to
5160	10120	a number of blogs that convinced me they'd got at least one thing right. There was much
10120	15380	ballyhoo in the media a few years ago when two huge chunks of the Petermann Glacier in
15380	20680	Greenland broke away, and it led to concerns from scientists about an increase in the rate
20680	26920	of melting of Greenland's ice cap. And yet, as the bloggers rightly point out, the glacier
26920	33100	hasn't retreated, it's been advancing. Why can't scientists who study the glacier
33100	35920	see that too? We should all be very concerned about the
35920	41480	fact that our so-called free press and scientists in academia are aligned to us in such a bold
41480	43800	and obvious fashion. Well, that's a bit strong.
43800	47080	The corruption in climate academia is obviously very deep.
47080	51840	Hang on, before I start climbing on board with a conspiracy theory, I need to do a bit
51840	56380	more than just spend five minutes looking at blogs and photos.
56380	61400	The first thing that puzzled me was, since no one disputes the fact that two huge chunks
61400	67100	of ice came away from the Petermann Glacier, why didn't that make a dent in its position?
67100	72740	Why did it move forwards rather than backwards? So I looked more carefully at the timeline
72740	78840	and found more information and then I checked my watch. It had taken only another five minutes
78840	85440	to discover that all these very convincing blogs and videos are talking complete nonsense.
85440	91560	They all show photos of the ice advancing after 2012, which is true. But how come they
91560	98320	never show photos of what happened before 2012? And this is what it looks like. These
98320	105360	red lines mark the outlines of blocks of ice that broke away in 2010 and 2012. So let's
105360	109760	take a closer look at what the blogs aren't showing you.
109760	113840	The Petermann Glacier is in the far north of Greenland and one of the reasons it's
113840	119640	being studied is that it's been pretty stable for over 130 years, since it was first measured
119640	127000	in 1876 until the massive break-up of 2010. As the ice front advances at the rate of about
127000	132880	a kilometre a year, small icebergs are breaking off into the sea or carving, keeping the ice
132880	139240	front pretty much in equilibrium. This is what the ice front looked like in 1999 and
139240	146520	2004 and again in 2010. But around 2008 researchers noticed cracks
146520	153120	beginning to appear and in 2010 something unusual happened. A huge area of ice four
153120	159160	times the size of Manhattan broke away. It was a record. And sure enough the rupture
159160	164880	did cause the ice front to retreat. Then more cracks appeared further upstream
164880	170600	and in 2012 the same thing happened again. This time a double Manhattan sized chunk of
170600	177160	ice separated and again the ice front moved back. Researchers calculated that the break-ups
177160	184240	shortened the glacier in the fjord from 81 kilometres in length to 46 kilometres.
184320	190960	The advance between 2012 and 2019 hasn't even made up for the ice lost in the 2012
190960	197680	break-up, let alone the 2010 break-up. Now more cracks are appearing 12 kilometres even
197680	204840	further upstream, just like the cracks that heralded the 2010 and 2012 break-ups. Researchers
204840	210220	are expecting that another ice island may break away in the next few years. That would
210220	215980	take the ice front back even further. The next thing I checked was why the scientists
215980	221100	were claiming that the ice was not advancing after 2012 when it clearly was.
227820	233700	Good question. Is it really because they're paid to lie about the climate? No, again,
233700	238780	it turns out the bloggers got that wrong too. Firstly, when bloggers make a claim about
238780	245260	what someone said without providing a name or a quote, be sceptical. Experience has shown
245260	250780	me that it usually means they've made it up. I can't find a single instance of a
250780	256460	scientist making that claim and neither can the bloggers. On the contrary, scientists
256460	262540	have openly reported on the advance in the ice since 2012. NASA has posted images of
262540	268060	it online. The advance is mentioned and illustrated in scientific studies. You can even look it
268060	273100	up on Wikipedia. So if the bloggers think they've exposed a scurrilous secret that
273100	277940	scientists are trying to hide, I'm sorry to say that everyone else was way ahead of
277940	283460	you. And they certainly never claimed that the ice was retreating.
283460	287380	Then I noticed something in Tony Heller's video that showed where this idea might have
287380	293020	come from and it's a great insight into how these conspiracy theories get started. I'll
293020	298060	come back to that in a minute. First, it's important to look at why the
298060	303400	Petermann Glacier is behaving like this. After all, you don't see seven years of advance
303400	308820	like this in most of the world's glaciers. They're nearly all retreating.
308820	313660	So here's a bit of background. Outside of tectonic movement, glaciers advance and retreat
313660	318820	according to two main factors. One is the amount of snowfall they receive at the top
318820	323240	in what's called the accumulation zone. The other is the amount of ice that melts
323240	329820	at the bottom, called the ablation zone. The terminus of the glacier is called its foot.
329820	335660	When accumulation and ablation are in balance, the foot of the glacier neither advances or
335660	339740	retreats. In recent decades, the amount of snow accumulating
339740	345380	on glaciers has been outpaced by rapid melting. And the ablation zone has been moving higher
345380	350620	up again because of warmer air temperature. As a result, the feet of most glaciers have
350620	356500	been in constant retreat and certainly haven't been advancing since 2012.
356500	363040	So why is the Petermann Glacier behaving differently? Answer, because none of the photos in any
363040	368540	of the blogs actually show the foot of the Petermann Glacier.
368540	373660	I know, I was as shocked as you are. Turns out I didn't know as much about glaciers as
373660	377900	I thought. Greenland's glaciers aren't like the mountain
377900	382340	glaciers we're familiar with and the ones I've studied. They're continental glaciers,
382340	386940	an extension of the massive Greenland ice sheet. Basically they're an outflow of the
386940	393620	sheet itself. Unlike mountain glaciers, they're tapping into a huge reservoir of ice. And
393620	399020	unlike mountain glaciers that end on land, the Petermann Glacier extends far into the
399020	405300	sea. It continues in contact with bedrock for a short distance, but then it floats and
405300	410860	for most of its length it's an ice shelf known as the Petermann Tongue. So what we're seeing
410860	417420	in all these photos is the edge of the ice shelf, not the foot of the glacier.
417420	422540	This is important because the ice shelf isn't moving under its own weight due to gravity,
422540	427380	like a mountain glacier. What's causing it to move is the force of the descending land
427380	432940	ice behind it. And because the ice shelf is stuck between two rock faces on each side
432940	439780	of a fjord, it resists this movement. Effectively it acts like a break, holding back the outflow
439780	443980	of the ice sheet behind it. Anyone who's lived in a cold climate will
443980	449460	be familiar with the blockage that ice can cause inside a frozen pipe. It impedes the
449460	455680	flow of water. You have to warm the pipe to get the ice to break up and break away. As
455680	461340	chunks of ice come out, the blockage is cleared and the water flows faster.
461340	466680	So this isn't a difficult concept to grasp, and scientists say that's the danger of what's
466680	471880	happening on the Petermann ice shelf. If large chunks of this blockage continue to break
471880	478140	away, the ice will flow more freely and quickly out of the ice sheet, and that will accelerate
478140	482040	sea level rise. That's why scientists have been studying
482040	487720	the velocity of the Petermann glacier since the early 1990s, and that's a measure of how
487720	493360	much ice is flowing. And there was indeed an increase in velocity of the glacier after
493360	500280	the 2012 blockage was removed. We see the ice flowing more freely. In normal times it
500280	506040	takes one step forwards and one step backwards as icebergs carve into the sea. So the small
506040	511360	advance we've seen over the last seven years is not unusual. What's different now is that
511360	515880	it's taking one step forward and seven steps backwards.
515880	521880	There have been large break-offs before, around 1960 and 1991, but what scientists are concerned
521880	526760	about is the fact that the breaks are becoming larger and more frequent. Instead of being
526760	531880	decades apart, the last two were just two years apart, and another rift may already
531880	539200	be forming. And the 2010 break-up was much larger than anything that's been seen before.
539200	544500	The omission of all this crucial detail in the blogs can't be because of ignorance, because
544500	550000	even though the bloggers don't read scientific journals, even the newspapers they cite explain
550000	555960	it. This is from the independent story that Anthony Watts cited on his blog, but didn't
555960	561320	show. And Tony Heller shows the top of the Washington Post story, but cuts it off before
561320	567120	the crucial paragraph that also explains it all, and he replaces it with this tip. You'd
567120	573400	have to be a complete moron to believe anything the Washington Post writes about climate.
573400	578740	I'm no fan of the way the media reports science, as anyone familiar with my channel would know,
578740	582880	but this reference to the Washington Post brings me back to the false claim I showed
582880	587880	earlier. Where did Heller get the idea that scientists claimed the ice was retreating
587880	588880	after 2012?
588880	594480	Why are they claiming that the Petermann glacier has shrunk since the cabin event in 2012?
594480	601320	As I said, that's simply not true. Scientists say clearly that the ice advanced after 2012,
601320	606580	but I think I've figured out how Heller managed to make completely the opposite conclusion.
606580	608620	This is from his video.
608620	612480	So based on the Washington Post article, it would be safe to assume that the ice edge
612480	614740	has retreated since 2012.
614740	620960	But is it safe to assume the Washington Post says that? Well, that's very easy to check.
620960	625040	Let's read the Washington Post story and find out.
625040	630600	It turns out the Washington Post did not claim the ice had been retreating after 2012. In
630600	636120	fact, it had a graphic that clearly showed the advance since 2012, and it even gives
636120	642400	the speed of the advance about one kilometre a year. So the assumption that it said otherwise
642400	648480	is nonsense and could very easily have been checked. Therefore the assumption that a scientist
648480	658240	told the Washington Post this, which then becomes a pluralised fact fed to subscribers,
658240	661520	is completely made up.
661520	666520	Fortunately the people who follow these blogs are all sceptics. So when I read the comments
666520	670840	sections, I discovered that most of them had checked the newspaper stories for themselves
670840	675120	and discovered that the assumptions were wrong and uncovered the complete picture that the
675120	680600	bloggers didn't show. I'm kidding. Of course they didn't do that. They're not the least
680600	686160	bit sceptical. They didn't bother checking any of this. Of course they blindly believe
686160	691520	whatever the bloggers tell them. We're living in an internet world plagued by conspiracy
691520	692520	theories.
692520	696680	Why is it up to me to go do five minutes of research on the NASA website to find out what
696680	698640	a big lie this whole story was?
698640	703080	Well maybe you shouldn't just spend five minutes looking at some photos and decide that you
703080	707520	know more about this than the oceanographers and glaciologists who spend half the year
707520	713400	on the ice shelf studying it. Maybe you should spend more than five minutes on this and read
713400	718800	some of the material you're citing and find out what scientists actually said, rather
718800	723360	than jumping to the conclusion that they must be lying because you assume the only source
723360	726560	you cite says something it doesn't.
726560	731360	That goes for all the bloggers who misrepresented these facts. No one is forcing you to sit
731360	738480	comfortably at home, look at a few photos, misrepresent the science and ask for donations.
738480	743000	After all, it was only after I'd spent five minutes looking at the photos and agreed that
743000	749360	the ice was advancing that I discovered what happened before 2012 and that scientists didn't
749360	755440	lie and claim the ice was retreating after 2012. And after more hours studying the research
755440	761280	material I learned how the velocity of the glacier increased after the 2012 carving and
761280	767040	why that happened and why it's important. And I learned that 80% of the melting is coming
767040	771880	from warmer water underneath the glacier and that recent measurements show the temperature
771880	777160	of that water is increasing. I'm not going to pretend that a few days studying this makes
777160	782680	me any kind of authority, but I do know a lot more than I did when I started out, reading
782680	787640	the blogs and looking at a few photos. There's still a huge amount of information I can't
787640	793280	squeeze into a 16 minute video, and there's still a lot the researchers don't know. That's
793280	798280	why they're not saying that the ice breaks are a sure sign of global warming, contrary
798280	805440	to what the bloggers claim, but they are saying that they're concerned and they explain why.
805440	810100	Maybe we should listen to those concerns and understand the science behind them instead
810100	816300	of believing blogs that deliberately hide the evidence and make up fabricated claims.
816300	821740	So please fact check anything in this video that you're sceptical about. Unlike the bloggers,
821740	827960	I cite all my sources in the video description, so it's easy for you to check. To the conspiracy
827960	832940	theorists out there, if you have to misquote me to find a mistake, or if you can't do any
832940	838980	better than criticise my voice, my attitude or my personality, thanks. I'll take that
838980	844340	as a sign that you've fact checked my video and can't find a single error. But if you
844340	850780	do find a mistake, then of course I'll be happy to issue a correction, as I always do.
850780	855580	I wonder if we'll see the bloggers do the same thing.
855580	861260	Unlike these blogs, my channel isn't monetised and I don't ask for donations, so I've suggested
861260	865680	that if you want to give money to support this channel, please give it to a worthy charity
865680	869300	which is detailed at the top of the video description.
869300	872860	And just to set the record straight for a few people who made assumptions about this
872860	878040	charity and didn't bother to check their facts before posting, ironic given the theme of
878040	884880	this video, this is not a reforestation project and it hasn't been imposed on local people.
884880	890540	It was instigated at their request. The charity has successfully stopped most of the illegal
890540	896420	logging in a national park in Borneo by offering free community medical healthcare in return
896420	901300	for a commitment not to cut down trees, since the main reason people were logging in the
901300	906360	national park was to get money when family members were sick. Payment to the hospital
906360	911060	is made in the form of saplings, which are planted in open spaces of the forest that
911060	917540	had previously been logged. Camera traps show that wildlife is now returning to these areas.
917540	923580	And money from carbon credits for this reforestation pays the salaries of doctors and nurses.
923580	929020	The people get proper healthcare and the forest is being conserved and even restored.
929020	933980	So reforestation is only one element of this model, which thanks to your donations is now
933980	939900	being trialled in Madagascar and Brazil. I'm not connected to the charity, I just did a
939900	945940	story on the project several years ago and was hugely impressed. So when people started
945980	951820	asking if they could donate to my channel, I told them to donate here instead. And thanks
951820	953100	to all of those who did.
