1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,160
I'm usually rather scathing about climate bloggers, but someone sent me some links to

2
00:00:05,160 --> 00:00:10,120
a number of blogs that convinced me they'd got at least one thing right. There was much

3
00:00:10,120 --> 00:00:15,380
ballyhoo in the media a few years ago when two huge chunks of the Petermann Glacier in

4
00:00:15,380 --> 00:00:20,680
Greenland broke away, and it led to concerns from scientists about an increase in the rate

5
00:00:20,680 --> 00:00:26,920
of melting of Greenland's ice cap. And yet, as the bloggers rightly point out, the glacier

6
00:00:26,920 --> 00:00:33,100
hasn't retreated, it's been advancing. Why can't scientists who study the glacier

7
00:00:33,100 --> 00:00:35,920
see that too? We should all be very concerned about the

8
00:00:35,920 --> 00:00:41,480
fact that our so-called free press and scientists in academia are aligned to us in such a bold

9
00:00:41,480 --> 00:00:43,800
and obvious fashion. Well, that's a bit strong.

10
00:00:43,800 --> 00:00:47,080
The corruption in climate academia is obviously very deep.

11
00:00:47,080 --> 00:00:51,840
Hang on, before I start climbing on board with a conspiracy theory, I need to do a bit

12
00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:56,380
more than just spend five minutes looking at blogs and photos.

13
00:00:56,380 --> 00:01:01,400
The first thing that puzzled me was, since no one disputes the fact that two huge chunks

14
00:01:01,400 --> 00:01:07,100
of ice came away from the Petermann Glacier, why didn't that make a dent in its position?

15
00:01:07,100 --> 00:01:12,740
Why did it move forwards rather than backwards? So I looked more carefully at the timeline

16
00:01:12,740 --> 00:01:18,840
and found more information and then I checked my watch. It had taken only another five minutes

17
00:01:18,840 --> 00:01:25,440
to discover that all these very convincing blogs and videos are talking complete nonsense.

18
00:01:25,440 --> 00:01:31,560
They all show photos of the ice advancing after 2012, which is true. But how come they

19
00:01:31,560 --> 00:01:38,320
never show photos of what happened before 2012? And this is what it looks like. These

20
00:01:38,320 --> 00:01:45,360
red lines mark the outlines of blocks of ice that broke away in 2010 and 2012. So let's

21
00:01:45,360 --> 00:01:49,760
take a closer look at what the blogs aren't showing you.

22
00:01:49,760 --> 00:01:53,840
The Petermann Glacier is in the far north of Greenland and one of the reasons it's

23
00:01:53,840 --> 00:01:59,640
being studied is that it's been pretty stable for over 130 years, since it was first measured

24
00:01:59,640 --> 00:02:07,000
in 1876 until the massive break-up of 2010. As the ice front advances at the rate of about

25
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:12,880
a kilometre a year, small icebergs are breaking off into the sea or carving, keeping the ice

26
00:02:12,880 --> 00:02:19,240
front pretty much in equilibrium. This is what the ice front looked like in 1999 and

27
00:02:19,240 --> 00:02:26,520
2004 and again in 2010. But around 2008 researchers noticed cracks

28
00:02:26,520 --> 00:02:33,120
beginning to appear and in 2010 something unusual happened. A huge area of ice four

29
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:39,160
times the size of Manhattan broke away. It was a record. And sure enough the rupture

30
00:02:39,160 --> 00:02:44,880
did cause the ice front to retreat. Then more cracks appeared further upstream

31
00:02:44,880 --> 00:02:50,600
and in 2012 the same thing happened again. This time a double Manhattan sized chunk of

32
00:02:50,600 --> 00:02:57,160
ice separated and again the ice front moved back. Researchers calculated that the break-ups

33
00:02:57,160 --> 00:03:04,240
shortened the glacier in the fjord from 81 kilometres in length to 46 kilometres.

34
00:03:04,320 --> 00:03:10,960
The advance between 2012 and 2019 hasn't even made up for the ice lost in the 2012

35
00:03:10,960 --> 00:03:17,680
break-up, let alone the 2010 break-up. Now more cracks are appearing 12 kilometres even

36
00:03:17,680 --> 00:03:24,840
further upstream, just like the cracks that heralded the 2010 and 2012 break-ups. Researchers

37
00:03:24,840 --> 00:03:30,220
are expecting that another ice island may break away in the next few years. That would

38
00:03:30,220 --> 00:03:35,980
take the ice front back even further. The next thing I checked was why the scientists

39
00:03:35,980 --> 00:03:41,100
were claiming that the ice was not advancing after 2012 when it clearly was.

40
00:03:47,820 --> 00:03:53,700
Good question. Is it really because they're paid to lie about the climate? No, again,

41
00:03:53,700 --> 00:03:58,780
it turns out the bloggers got that wrong too. Firstly, when bloggers make a claim about

42
00:03:58,780 --> 00:04:05,260
what someone said without providing a name or a quote, be sceptical. Experience has shown

43
00:04:05,260 --> 00:04:10,780
me that it usually means they've made it up. I can't find a single instance of a

44
00:04:10,780 --> 00:04:16,460
scientist making that claim and neither can the bloggers. On the contrary, scientists

45
00:04:16,460 --> 00:04:22,540
have openly reported on the advance in the ice since 2012. NASA has posted images of

46
00:04:22,540 --> 00:04:28,060
it online. The advance is mentioned and illustrated in scientific studies. You can even look it

47
00:04:28,060 --> 00:04:33,100
up on Wikipedia. So if the bloggers think they've exposed a scurrilous secret that

48
00:04:33,100 --> 00:04:37,940
scientists are trying to hide, I'm sorry to say that everyone else was way ahead of

49
00:04:37,940 --> 00:04:43,460
you. And they certainly never claimed that the ice was retreating.

50
00:04:43,460 --> 00:04:47,380
Then I noticed something in Tony Heller's video that showed where this idea might have

51
00:04:47,380 --> 00:04:53,020
come from and it's a great insight into how these conspiracy theories get started. I'll

52
00:04:53,020 --> 00:04:58,060
come back to that in a minute. First, it's important to look at why the

53
00:04:58,060 --> 00:05:03,400
Petermann Glacier is behaving like this. After all, you don't see seven years of advance

54
00:05:03,400 --> 00:05:08,820
like this in most of the world's glaciers. They're nearly all retreating.

55
00:05:08,820 --> 00:05:13,660
So here's a bit of background. Outside of tectonic movement, glaciers advance and retreat

56
00:05:13,660 --> 00:05:18,820
according to two main factors. One is the amount of snowfall they receive at the top

57
00:05:18,820 --> 00:05:23,240
in what's called the accumulation zone. The other is the amount of ice that melts

58
00:05:23,240 --> 00:05:29,820
at the bottom, called the ablation zone. The terminus of the glacier is called its foot.

59
00:05:29,820 --> 00:05:35,660
When accumulation and ablation are in balance, the foot of the glacier neither advances or

60
00:05:35,660 --> 00:05:39,740
retreats. In recent decades, the amount of snow accumulating

61
00:05:39,740 --> 00:05:45,380
on glaciers has been outpaced by rapid melting. And the ablation zone has been moving higher

62
00:05:45,380 --> 00:05:50,620
up again because of warmer air temperature. As a result, the feet of most glaciers have

63
00:05:50,620 --> 00:05:56,500
been in constant retreat and certainly haven't been advancing since 2012.

64
00:05:56,500 --> 00:06:03,040
So why is the Petermann Glacier behaving differently? Answer, because none of the photos in any

65
00:06:03,040 --> 00:06:08,540
of the blogs actually show the foot of the Petermann Glacier.

66
00:06:08,540 --> 00:06:13,660
I know, I was as shocked as you are. Turns out I didn't know as much about glaciers as

67
00:06:13,660 --> 00:06:17,900
I thought. Greenland's glaciers aren't like the mountain

68
00:06:17,900 --> 00:06:22,340
glaciers we're familiar with and the ones I've studied. They're continental glaciers,

69
00:06:22,340 --> 00:06:26,940
an extension of the massive Greenland ice sheet. Basically they're an outflow of the

70
00:06:26,940 --> 00:06:33,620
sheet itself. Unlike mountain glaciers, they're tapping into a huge reservoir of ice. And

71
00:06:33,620 --> 00:06:39,020
unlike mountain glaciers that end on land, the Petermann Glacier extends far into the

72
00:06:39,020 --> 00:06:45,300
sea. It continues in contact with bedrock for a short distance, but then it floats and

73
00:06:45,300 --> 00:06:50,860
for most of its length it's an ice shelf known as the Petermann Tongue. So what we're seeing

74
00:06:50,860 --> 00:06:57,420
in all these photos is the edge of the ice shelf, not the foot of the glacier.

75
00:06:57,420 --> 00:07:02,540
This is important because the ice shelf isn't moving under its own weight due to gravity,

76
00:07:02,540 --> 00:07:07,380
like a mountain glacier. What's causing it to move is the force of the descending land

77
00:07:07,380 --> 00:07:12,940
ice behind it. And because the ice shelf is stuck between two rock faces on each side

78
00:07:12,940 --> 00:07:19,780
of a fjord, it resists this movement. Effectively it acts like a break, holding back the outflow

79
00:07:19,780 --> 00:07:23,980
of the ice sheet behind it. Anyone who's lived in a cold climate will

80
00:07:23,980 --> 00:07:29,460
be familiar with the blockage that ice can cause inside a frozen pipe. It impedes the

81
00:07:29,460 --> 00:07:35,680
flow of water. You have to warm the pipe to get the ice to break up and break away. As

82
00:07:35,680 --> 00:07:41,340
chunks of ice come out, the blockage is cleared and the water flows faster.

83
00:07:41,340 --> 00:07:46,680
So this isn't a difficult concept to grasp, and scientists say that's the danger of what's

84
00:07:46,680 --> 00:07:51,880
happening on the Petermann ice shelf. If large chunks of this blockage continue to break

85
00:07:51,880 --> 00:07:58,140
away, the ice will flow more freely and quickly out of the ice sheet, and that will accelerate

86
00:07:58,140 --> 00:08:02,040
sea level rise. That's why scientists have been studying

87
00:08:02,040 --> 00:08:07,720
the velocity of the Petermann glacier since the early 1990s, and that's a measure of how

88
00:08:07,720 --> 00:08:13,360
much ice is flowing. And there was indeed an increase in velocity of the glacier after

89
00:08:13,360 --> 00:08:20,280
the 2012 blockage was removed. We see the ice flowing more freely. In normal times it

90
00:08:20,280 --> 00:08:26,040
takes one step forwards and one step backwards as icebergs carve into the sea. So the small

91
00:08:26,040 --> 00:08:31,360
advance we've seen over the last seven years is not unusual. What's different now is that

92
00:08:31,360 --> 00:08:35,880
it's taking one step forward and seven steps backwards.

93
00:08:35,880 --> 00:08:41,880
There have been large break-offs before, around 1960 and 1991, but what scientists are concerned

94
00:08:41,880 --> 00:08:46,760
about is the fact that the breaks are becoming larger and more frequent. Instead of being

95
00:08:46,760 --> 00:08:51,880
decades apart, the last two were just two years apart, and another rift may already

96
00:08:51,880 --> 00:08:59,200
be forming. And the 2010 break-up was much larger than anything that's been seen before.

97
00:08:59,200 --> 00:09:04,500
The omission of all this crucial detail in the blogs can't be because of ignorance, because

98
00:09:04,500 --> 00:09:10,000
even though the bloggers don't read scientific journals, even the newspapers they cite explain

99
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:15,960
it. This is from the independent story that Anthony Watts cited on his blog, but didn't

100
00:09:15,960 --> 00:09:21,320
show. And Tony Heller shows the top of the Washington Post story, but cuts it off before

101
00:09:21,320 --> 00:09:27,120
the crucial paragraph that also explains it all, and he replaces it with this tip. You'd

102
00:09:27,120 --> 00:09:33,400
have to be a complete moron to believe anything the Washington Post writes about climate.

103
00:09:33,400 --> 00:09:38,740
I'm no fan of the way the media reports science, as anyone familiar with my channel would know,

104
00:09:38,740 --> 00:09:42,880
but this reference to the Washington Post brings me back to the false claim I showed

105
00:09:42,880 --> 00:09:47,880
earlier. Where did Heller get the idea that scientists claimed the ice was retreating

106
00:09:47,880 --> 00:09:48,880
after 2012?

107
00:09:48,880 --> 00:09:54,480
Why are they claiming that the Petermann glacier has shrunk since the cabin event in 2012?

108
00:09:54,480 --> 00:10:01,320
As I said, that's simply not true. Scientists say clearly that the ice advanced after 2012,

109
00:10:01,320 --> 00:10:06,580
but I think I've figured out how Heller managed to make completely the opposite conclusion.

110
00:10:06,580 --> 00:10:08,620
This is from his video.

111
00:10:08,620 --> 00:10:12,480
So based on the Washington Post article, it would be safe to assume that the ice edge

112
00:10:12,480 --> 00:10:14,740
has retreated since 2012.

113
00:10:14,740 --> 00:10:20,960
But is it safe to assume the Washington Post says that? Well, that's very easy to check.

114
00:10:20,960 --> 00:10:25,040
Let's read the Washington Post story and find out.

115
00:10:25,040 --> 00:10:30,600
It turns out the Washington Post did not claim the ice had been retreating after 2012. In

116
00:10:30,600 --> 00:10:36,120
fact, it had a graphic that clearly showed the advance since 2012, and it even gives

117
00:10:36,120 --> 00:10:42,400
the speed of the advance about one kilometre a year. So the assumption that it said otherwise

118
00:10:42,400 --> 00:10:48,480
is nonsense and could very easily have been checked. Therefore the assumption that a scientist

119
00:10:48,480 --> 00:10:58,240
told the Washington Post this, which then becomes a pluralised fact fed to subscribers,

120
00:10:58,240 --> 00:11:01,520
is completely made up.

121
00:11:01,520 --> 00:11:06,520
Fortunately the people who follow these blogs are all sceptics. So when I read the comments

122
00:11:06,520 --> 00:11:10,840
sections, I discovered that most of them had checked the newspaper stories for themselves

123
00:11:10,840 --> 00:11:15,120
and discovered that the assumptions were wrong and uncovered the complete picture that the

124
00:11:15,120 --> 00:11:20,600
bloggers didn't show. I'm kidding. Of course they didn't do that. They're not the least

125
00:11:20,600 --> 00:11:26,160
bit sceptical. They didn't bother checking any of this. Of course they blindly believe

126
00:11:26,160 --> 00:11:31,520
whatever the bloggers tell them. We're living in an internet world plagued by conspiracy

127
00:11:31,520 --> 00:11:32,520
theories.

128
00:11:32,520 --> 00:11:36,680
Why is it up to me to go do five minutes of research on the NASA website to find out what

129
00:11:36,680 --> 00:11:38,640
a big lie this whole story was?

130
00:11:38,640 --> 00:11:43,080
Well maybe you shouldn't just spend five minutes looking at some photos and decide that you

131
00:11:43,080 --> 00:11:47,520
know more about this than the oceanographers and glaciologists who spend half the year

132
00:11:47,520 --> 00:11:53,400
on the ice shelf studying it. Maybe you should spend more than five minutes on this and read

133
00:11:53,400 --> 00:11:58,800
some of the material you're citing and find out what scientists actually said, rather

134
00:11:58,800 --> 00:12:03,360
than jumping to the conclusion that they must be lying because you assume the only source

135
00:12:03,360 --> 00:12:06,560
you cite says something it doesn't.

136
00:12:06,560 --> 00:12:11,360
That goes for all the bloggers who misrepresented these facts. No one is forcing you to sit

137
00:12:11,360 --> 00:12:18,480
comfortably at home, look at a few photos, misrepresent the science and ask for donations.

138
00:12:18,480 --> 00:12:23,000
After all, it was only after I'd spent five minutes looking at the photos and agreed that

139
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:29,360
the ice was advancing that I discovered what happened before 2012 and that scientists didn't

140
00:12:29,360 --> 00:12:35,440
lie and claim the ice was retreating after 2012. And after more hours studying the research

141
00:12:35,440 --> 00:12:41,280
material I learned how the velocity of the glacier increased after the 2012 carving and

142
00:12:41,280 --> 00:12:47,040
why that happened and why it's important. And I learned that 80% of the melting is coming

143
00:12:47,040 --> 00:12:51,880
from warmer water underneath the glacier and that recent measurements show the temperature

144
00:12:51,880 --> 00:12:57,160
of that water is increasing. I'm not going to pretend that a few days studying this makes

145
00:12:57,160 --> 00:13:02,680
me any kind of authority, but I do know a lot more than I did when I started out, reading

146
00:13:02,680 --> 00:13:07,640
the blogs and looking at a few photos. There's still a huge amount of information I can't

147
00:13:07,640 --> 00:13:13,280
squeeze into a 16 minute video, and there's still a lot the researchers don't know. That's

148
00:13:13,280 --> 00:13:18,280
why they're not saying that the ice breaks are a sure sign of global warming, contrary

149
00:13:18,280 --> 00:13:25,440
to what the bloggers claim, but they are saying that they're concerned and they explain why.

150
00:13:25,440 --> 00:13:30,100
Maybe we should listen to those concerns and understand the science behind them instead

151
00:13:30,100 --> 00:13:36,300
of believing blogs that deliberately hide the evidence and make up fabricated claims.

152
00:13:36,300 --> 00:13:41,740
So please fact check anything in this video that you're sceptical about. Unlike the bloggers,

153
00:13:41,740 --> 00:13:47,960
I cite all my sources in the video description, so it's easy for you to check. To the conspiracy

154
00:13:47,960 --> 00:13:52,940
theorists out there, if you have to misquote me to find a mistake, or if you can't do any

155
00:13:52,940 --> 00:13:58,980
better than criticise my voice, my attitude or my personality, thanks. I'll take that

156
00:13:58,980 --> 00:14:04,340
as a sign that you've fact checked my video and can't find a single error. But if you

157
00:14:04,340 --> 00:14:10,780
do find a mistake, then of course I'll be happy to issue a correction, as I always do.

158
00:14:10,780 --> 00:14:15,580
I wonder if we'll see the bloggers do the same thing.

159
00:14:15,580 --> 00:14:21,260
Unlike these blogs, my channel isn't monetised and I don't ask for donations, so I've suggested

160
00:14:21,260 --> 00:14:25,680
that if you want to give money to support this channel, please give it to a worthy charity

161
00:14:25,680 --> 00:14:29,300
which is detailed at the top of the video description.

162
00:14:29,300 --> 00:14:32,860
And just to set the record straight for a few people who made assumptions about this

163
00:14:32,860 --> 00:14:38,040
charity and didn't bother to check their facts before posting, ironic given the theme of

164
00:14:38,040 --> 00:14:44,880
this video, this is not a reforestation project and it hasn't been imposed on local people.

165
00:14:44,880 --> 00:14:50,540
It was instigated at their request. The charity has successfully stopped most of the illegal

166
00:14:50,540 --> 00:14:56,420
logging in a national park in Borneo by offering free community medical healthcare in return

167
00:14:56,420 --> 00:15:01,300
for a commitment not to cut down trees, since the main reason people were logging in the

168
00:15:01,300 --> 00:15:06,360
national park was to get money when family members were sick. Payment to the hospital

169
00:15:06,360 --> 00:15:11,060
is made in the form of saplings, which are planted in open spaces of the forest that

170
00:15:11,060 --> 00:15:17,540
had previously been logged. Camera traps show that wildlife is now returning to these areas.

171
00:15:17,540 --> 00:15:23,580
And money from carbon credits for this reforestation pays the salaries of doctors and nurses.

172
00:15:23,580 --> 00:15:29,020
The people get proper healthcare and the forest is being conserved and even restored.

173
00:15:29,020 --> 00:15:33,980
So reforestation is only one element of this model, which thanks to your donations is now

174
00:15:33,980 --> 00:15:39,900
being trialled in Madagascar and Brazil. I'm not connected to the charity, I just did a

175
00:15:39,900 --> 00:15:45,940
story on the project several years ago and was hugely impressed. So when people started

176
00:15:45,980 --> 00:15:51,820
asking if they could donate to my channel, I told them to donate here instead. And thanks

177
00:15:51,820 --> 00:15:53,100
to all of those who did.
