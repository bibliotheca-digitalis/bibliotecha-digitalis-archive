0	5420	I've had to hold my series on climate change because apparently there's no need to explain the science anymore.
5420	11520	Emails from the Climate Research Unit in the UK have been hacked, and it turns out the whole thing is a hoax.
11520	17960	I'm pleased to see that Phil Jones, director of the Climate Research Unit, has stepped down while all this is investigated.
17960	21660	But for the McExperts, an investigation simply isn't necessary.
21660	26360	Even before any of them had had a chance to read the emails, they immediately had an opinion.
26360	33720	A hacker seems to have uncovered evidence of substantial fraud in reporting the evidence on global warming.
33720	38960	If your gut said, wait a minute, this global warming thing, it sounds like a scam, well, I think you're seeing it now.
39520	47640	And the hacker's got all the secret documents, how they, how the big, fake environmentalists admit it's all a lie,
47640	55160	the Earth is cooling, carbon dioxide's good for you, and these people knew it the whole time.
55160	57680	Wow! Oh, the humanity!
57680	62080	I'm not going to have time in this video to look at the bitchiness, the derogatory remarks,
62080	67040	and the attempts to keep what the emailers regard as bad science out of the scientific literature.
67040	70200	If you're interested in that, I'll be happy to make another video.
70200	76160	What I want to look at in the time I've got available are examples of fraud uncovered by amateur skeptics,
76160	82720	examples of figures being fudged, collusion on doctoring the numbers, and admissions that data have been fabricated.
82720	83920	Here's an example.
83920	90240	We both know the probable flaws in Mike's reconstruction, particularly as it relates to the tropical stuff.
90240	91160	There you go.
91160	97320	Cook and Briff are secretly admitting that they know there are flaws in the temperature reconstruction done by Mike Mann.
97320	106000	The email goes on, the only way to deal with this whole issue is to show in a detailed study that his estimates are clearly deficient.
106000	108280	Wait a minute, that can't be right.
108280	109880	Okay, let's ditch that example.
109880	112360	There are hundreds more that show a conspiracy.
112360	113240	Look at this.
113240	121600	I've just completed Mike's nature trick of adding in the real temps to each series for the last 20 years, i.e. from 1981 onwards,
121600	126120	and from 1961 for Keith's to hide the decline.
126120	128160	Okay, that's more like it.
128160	129000	And look at this.
129000	134800	The fact is we can't account for the lack of warming at the moment, and it is a travesty that we can't.
134800	137080	Pretty damning, you've got to admit.
137080	138360	Let's have another example.
138360	148000	I have just completed Mike's nature trick of adding in the real temps to each series for the last 20 years to hide the decline.
148000	150600	No, that's the same as the first one.
150600	156400	The fact is we can't account for the lack of warming at the moment, and it's a travesty that we can't.
156400	158600	Hang on, that's the second one again.
158600	160120	I've just completed Mike's nature trick.
160120	161320	Is this the same one, fat mouth?
161320	164480	Of adding in the real temperatures to each series for the last...
164520	168840	I've just completed Mike's nature trick of adding to the real temps to each...
168840	174120	Some of these alleged emails may actually hold the key...
174120	175920	I think I'm seeing a pattern here.
175920	183840	Either these are by far the most egregious examples of fraud, or they're the only examples of fraud in 13 years of emails.
183840	187800	Well, that's hardly the hoax of the century, but let's look at these two emails anyway.
187800	194280	To hide the decline, that seems like deliberately changing the data to suit your way.
194280	197400	Yes, that's certainly what it looks like, doesn't it, Stuart?
197400	202760	Phil Jones's excuse is that researchers use the word trick to mean a clever thing to do.
202760	208200	But if that's how it's used, I ought to find the same usage in the scientific literature, right?
208200	211400	So I did a word search, and guess what?
211400	217680	The word trick is commonly used in fields as far apart as chemistry, computer science and biology.
217680	220800	And it seems to mean exactly what Jones says it means.
220800	226040	If it really meant a piece of fraud, then all these scientists are admitting in their opening paragraphs
226040	229840	that the scientific paper you're about to read is fraudulent.
229840	233360	And that interpretation is just too stupid to be correct.
233360	235920	But what about the term hide the decline?
235920	246720	And from 1961, for Keith, to hide the decline, they're talking about the decline in the temperature, global temperature.
246720	253320	If I had little understanding of climate science and little time to do any research, that's probably what I'd think too.
253320	256800	But in fact, Jones was talking about something completely different.
256800	261400	The apparent decline in temperatures shown by tree ring data since the 1950s.
261400	264000	This has nothing to do with actual temperatures.
264000	267720	It's about the responsiveness of tree rings to changes in climate.
267720	273560	The argument is whether tree rings should be used when reconstructing pre-industrial climates.
273560	278720	The word I honed in on wasn't trick or decline, but the word hide.
278720	284600	Just what Jones meant, and whether there was a deliberate fudging of data, needs to be investigated.
284600	290400	But whatever the outcome, this has nothing to do with whether the Earth has been warming since the mid-1970s
290400	294440	or whether carbon dioxide is a greenhouse gas.
294440	297360	So on to the other example of criminal fraud.
297360	302800	We can't account for the lack of warming at the moment, and it is a travesty that we can.
302800	304360	Well, that's self-explanatory.
304360	305360	Is it?
305360	310320	Kevin Tremburth is talking about cooling that was occurring in 2008-2009.
310320	314000	The explanation most climatologists give is the obvious one.
314000	319680	The Earth has been cooling for the last couple of years because we've been at the nadir of the 11-year solar cycle,
319680	323280	and last year was a particularly strong La Niña year.
323280	326640	I'll talk about the El Niño-La Niña cycle in a future video,
326640	332560	but basically it's a cycle in which the South Pacific Ocean either absorbs or releases heat.
332560	339520	Tremburth argues that the warming effect of carbon dioxide should be able to overcome these temporary cooling influences.
339520	343960	If the McExperts had read the emails that preceded and followed Tremburth's,
343960	347840	they would have seen that two other climatologists disagreed with him.
347840	351760	So the first thing to note is that Tremburth seems to be expressing his own opinion,
351760	355280	not necessarily that of the scientific community.
355280	359320	But even if we accept that the scientists he's in correspondence with don't agree,
359320	362360	the quote still shows that Tremburth is confessing in private
362360	367120	that he can't explain the lack of warming, and publicly saying the complete opposite.
367120	368520	Isn't he?
368520	372880	I mean, isn't that what this conspiracy is all about? Covering up these secret doubts?
372880	376840	Actually, if the blabbering McExperts had bothered to read his email more carefully,
376840	380120	they would have seen that Tremburth was referring to a paper he'd written.
380120	382160	He even gave us the URL.
382160	389560	And if they'd bothered to click on it, they'd have found the paper he wrote expressing publicly the same doubts he expressed privately.
389560	395720	So the McExperts didn't have to read hacked emails to find evidence of Tremburth's supposedly secret doubts.
395720	399880	All they had to do was read his paper, available online.
399880	402880	If this is a conspiracy, it's a very weird one.
402880	406080	Surely at least one email would allude to this supposed hoax.
406080	411800	Dr Spencer looked at this. He said this is too, too, too elaborate to be a hoax.
411800	415800	Rush Limbaugh isn't talking about anthropogenic climate change here.
415800	419160	No, he's talking about whether the emails were a hoax.
419160	423760	Faking a thousand emails? No, says Limbaugh, that's too elaborate to be a hoax.
423760	429800	But faking millions of points of data in thousands of scientific papers, in dozens of different scientific fields,
429800	434800	and cross-matching them so that they all tell a story that's 180 degrees opposed to reality,
434800	437600	and making sure that no one blabs about it?
437600	440040	Yep, Rush thinks that's what's happened.
440040	449640	Bring these people to justice that they be trying for fraud. Billion-dollar, trillion-dollar fraud.
449640	450640	Shut up!
450640	453520	Now look, you don't know anything about this, see?
453520	455320	No, no, I don't know nothing.
455320	462240	The hackers got all the secret documents. It's in AP. It's in Washington Post.
462240	465640	Sullivan picked it up at my home. He's got everything that was in my safe.
465640	469240	Account books, receipts, names, addresses, bank books, everything.
470240	475240	I've instinctively known this from the get-go from 20 years ago. The whole thing's made up.
475240	478240	And the reason I know it is because liberals are behind it.
478240	482240	I'm taking care of this job myself. Get Blackie up here right away.
482240	483240	He's talking about a trick.
483240	485240	Knowingly perpetuating fraud.
485240	489240	The theory of global warming is a huge conspiracy.
489240	496240	OK, before you all get too excited, too late, investigate what's been written and what it actually means.
496240	498240	And hold off posting this message.
498240	501240	Well, you were just putting your spin on this.
501240	504240	If you think anything I've told you is incorrect, then check it.
504240	507240	Check the use of the word trick in the scientific literature.
507240	512240	And whether decline is referring to global temperatures or tree-ring proxies.
512240	517240	Check Trembath's paper and whether his views are shared by Schneider and Wigley.
517240	520240	And try to restrain your urge to post this message.
520240	524240	The reason I'm talking about these two emails is that they're the ones that have been held up
524240	530240	by every blogger and television fat mouth as the best and most obvious examples of this huge fraud.
530240	534240	Whatever skullduggery there is will be investigated.
534240	541240	But thankfully it won't be investigated by febrile nitwits who think proxy temperatures are the same as global temperatures
541240	544240	and who aren't even aware of what's in the scientific literature.
544240	548240	It'll be investigated by people who take the time to go over each message
548240	551240	and who understand the science that's being discussed.
552240	556240	And they'll come across emails most conspiracy theorists aren't even aware of.
556240	558240	Like this one from Tom Wigley.
558240	563240	This is a complex issue and your misrepresentation of it does you a disservice.
563240	568240	To someone like me who knows the science, it's apparent that you're presenting a personal view,
568240	571240	not an informed, balanced scientific assessment.
571240	575240	Now you may think he's writing to a group of skeptics, but he's not.
575240	580240	He's writing to a bunch of non-scientific academics, soliciting signatures for a letter,
580240	583240	pushing for tougher controls on carbon emissions.
583240	586240	And you won't see Glenn Beck quoting that.
586240	588240	Say it with me.
588240	590240	Conspiracy.
590240	592240	Conspiracy.
