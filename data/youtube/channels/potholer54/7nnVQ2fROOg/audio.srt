1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,420
I've had to hold my series on climate change because apparently there's no need to explain the science anymore.

2
00:00:05,420 --> 00:00:11,520
Emails from the Climate Research Unit in the UK have been hacked, and it turns out the whole thing is a hoax.

3
00:00:11,520 --> 00:00:17,960
I'm pleased to see that Phil Jones, director of the Climate Research Unit, has stepped down while all this is investigated.

4
00:00:17,960 --> 00:00:21,660
But for the McExperts, an investigation simply isn't necessary.

5
00:00:21,660 --> 00:00:26,360
Even before any of them had had a chance to read the emails, they immediately had an opinion.

6
00:00:26,360 --> 00:00:33,720
A hacker seems to have uncovered evidence of substantial fraud in reporting the evidence on global warming.

7
00:00:33,720 --> 00:00:38,960
If your gut said, wait a minute, this global warming thing, it sounds like a scam, well, I think you're seeing it now.

8
00:00:39,520 --> 00:00:47,640
And the hacker's got all the secret documents, how they, how the big, fake environmentalists admit it's all a lie,

9
00:00:47,640 --> 00:00:55,160
the Earth is cooling, carbon dioxide's good for you, and these people knew it the whole time.

10
00:00:55,160 --> 00:00:57,680
Wow! Oh, the humanity!

11
00:00:57,680 --> 00:01:02,080
I'm not going to have time in this video to look at the bitchiness, the derogatory remarks,

12
00:01:02,080 --> 00:01:07,040
and the attempts to keep what the emailers regard as bad science out of the scientific literature.

13
00:01:07,040 --> 00:01:10,200
If you're interested in that, I'll be happy to make another video.

14
00:01:10,200 --> 00:01:16,160
What I want to look at in the time I've got available are examples of fraud uncovered by amateur skeptics,

15
00:01:16,160 --> 00:01:22,720
examples of figures being fudged, collusion on doctoring the numbers, and admissions that data have been fabricated.

16
00:01:22,720 --> 00:01:23,920
Here's an example.

17
00:01:23,920 --> 00:01:30,240
We both know the probable flaws in Mike's reconstruction, particularly as it relates to the tropical stuff.

18
00:01:30,240 --> 00:01:31,160
There you go.

19
00:01:31,160 --> 00:01:37,320
Cook and Briff are secretly admitting that they know there are flaws in the temperature reconstruction done by Mike Mann.

20
00:01:37,320 --> 00:01:46,000
The email goes on, the only way to deal with this whole issue is to show in a detailed study that his estimates are clearly deficient.

21
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,280
Wait a minute, that can't be right.

22
00:01:48,280 --> 00:01:49,880
Okay, let's ditch that example.

23
00:01:49,880 --> 00:01:52,360
There are hundreds more that show a conspiracy.

24
00:01:52,360 --> 00:01:53,240
Look at this.

25
00:01:53,240 --> 00:02:01,600
I've just completed Mike's nature trick of adding in the real temps to each series for the last 20 years, i.e. from 1981 onwards,

26
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:06,120
and from 1961 for Keith's to hide the decline.

27
00:02:06,120 --> 00:02:08,160
Okay, that's more like it.

28
00:02:08,160 --> 00:02:09,000
And look at this.

29
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:14,800
The fact is we can't account for the lack of warming at the moment, and it is a travesty that we can't.

30
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:17,080
Pretty damning, you've got to admit.

31
00:02:17,080 --> 00:02:18,360
Let's have another example.

32
00:02:18,360 --> 00:02:28,000
I have just completed Mike's nature trick of adding in the real temps to each series for the last 20 years to hide the decline.

33
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,600
No, that's the same as the first one.

34
00:02:30,600 --> 00:02:36,400
The fact is we can't account for the lack of warming at the moment, and it's a travesty that we can't.

35
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:38,600
Hang on, that's the second one again.

36
00:02:38,600 --> 00:02:40,120
I've just completed Mike's nature trick.

37
00:02:40,120 --> 00:02:41,320
Is this the same one, fat mouth?

38
00:02:41,320 --> 00:02:44,480
Of adding in the real temperatures to each series for the last...

39
00:02:44,520 --> 00:02:48,840
I've just completed Mike's nature trick of adding to the real temps to each...

40
00:02:48,840 --> 00:02:54,120
Some of these alleged emails may actually hold the key...

41
00:02:54,120 --> 00:02:55,920
I think I'm seeing a pattern here.

42
00:02:55,920 --> 00:03:03,840
Either these are by far the most egregious examples of fraud, or they're the only examples of fraud in 13 years of emails.

43
00:03:03,840 --> 00:03:07,800
Well, that's hardly the hoax of the century, but let's look at these two emails anyway.

44
00:03:07,800 --> 00:03:14,280
To hide the decline, that seems like deliberately changing the data to suit your way.

45
00:03:14,280 --> 00:03:17,400
Yes, that's certainly what it looks like, doesn't it, Stuart?

46
00:03:17,400 --> 00:03:22,760
Phil Jones's excuse is that researchers use the word trick to mean a clever thing to do.

47
00:03:22,760 --> 00:03:28,200
But if that's how it's used, I ought to find the same usage in the scientific literature, right?

48
00:03:28,200 --> 00:03:31,400
So I did a word search, and guess what?

49
00:03:31,400 --> 00:03:37,680
The word trick is commonly used in fields as far apart as chemistry, computer science and biology.

50
00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:40,800
And it seems to mean exactly what Jones says it means.

51
00:03:40,800 --> 00:03:46,040
If it really meant a piece of fraud, then all these scientists are admitting in their opening paragraphs

52
00:03:46,040 --> 00:03:49,840
that the scientific paper you're about to read is fraudulent.

53
00:03:49,840 --> 00:03:53,360
And that interpretation is just too stupid to be correct.

54
00:03:53,360 --> 00:03:55,920
But what about the term hide the decline?

55
00:03:55,920 --> 00:04:06,720
And from 1961, for Keith, to hide the decline, they're talking about the decline in the temperature, global temperature.

56
00:04:06,720 --> 00:04:13,320
If I had little understanding of climate science and little time to do any research, that's probably what I'd think too.

57
00:04:13,320 --> 00:04:16,800
But in fact, Jones was talking about something completely different.

58
00:04:16,800 --> 00:04:21,400
The apparent decline in temperatures shown by tree ring data since the 1950s.

59
00:04:21,400 --> 00:04:24,000
This has nothing to do with actual temperatures.

60
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:27,720
It's about the responsiveness of tree rings to changes in climate.

61
00:04:27,720 --> 00:04:33,560
The argument is whether tree rings should be used when reconstructing pre-industrial climates.

62
00:04:33,560 --> 00:04:38,720
The word I honed in on wasn't trick or decline, but the word hide.

63
00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:44,600
Just what Jones meant, and whether there was a deliberate fudging of data, needs to be investigated.

64
00:04:44,600 --> 00:04:50,400
But whatever the outcome, this has nothing to do with whether the Earth has been warming since the mid-1970s

65
00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:54,440
or whether carbon dioxide is a greenhouse gas.

66
00:04:54,440 --> 00:04:57,360
So on to the other example of criminal fraud.

67
00:04:57,360 --> 00:05:02,800
We can't account for the lack of warming at the moment, and it is a travesty that we can.

68
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:04,360
Well, that's self-explanatory.

69
00:05:04,360 --> 00:05:05,360
Is it?

70
00:05:05,360 --> 00:05:10,320
Kevin Tremburth is talking about cooling that was occurring in 2008-2009.

71
00:05:10,320 --> 00:05:14,000
The explanation most climatologists give is the obvious one.

72
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:19,680
The Earth has been cooling for the last couple of years because we've been at the nadir of the 11-year solar cycle,

73
00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:23,280
and last year was a particularly strong La Niña year.

74
00:05:23,280 --> 00:05:26,640
I'll talk about the El Niño-La Niña cycle in a future video,

75
00:05:26,640 --> 00:05:32,560
but basically it's a cycle in which the South Pacific Ocean either absorbs or releases heat.

76
00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:39,520
Tremburth argues that the warming effect of carbon dioxide should be able to overcome these temporary cooling influences.

77
00:05:39,520 --> 00:05:43,960
If the McExperts had read the emails that preceded and followed Tremburth's,

78
00:05:43,960 --> 00:05:47,840
they would have seen that two other climatologists disagreed with him.

79
00:05:47,840 --> 00:05:51,760
So the first thing to note is that Tremburth seems to be expressing his own opinion,

80
00:05:51,760 --> 00:05:55,280
not necessarily that of the scientific community.

81
00:05:55,280 --> 00:05:59,320
But even if we accept that the scientists he's in correspondence with don't agree,

82
00:05:59,320 --> 00:06:02,360
the quote still shows that Tremburth is confessing in private

83
00:06:02,360 --> 00:06:07,120
that he can't explain the lack of warming, and publicly saying the complete opposite.

84
00:06:07,120 --> 00:06:08,520
Isn't he?

85
00:06:08,520 --> 00:06:12,880
I mean, isn't that what this conspiracy is all about? Covering up these secret doubts?

86
00:06:12,880 --> 00:06:16,840
Actually, if the blabbering McExperts had bothered to read his email more carefully,

87
00:06:16,840 --> 00:06:20,120
they would have seen that Tremburth was referring to a paper he'd written.

88
00:06:20,120 --> 00:06:22,160
He even gave us the URL.

89
00:06:22,160 --> 00:06:29,560
And if they'd bothered to click on it, they'd have found the paper he wrote expressing publicly the same doubts he expressed privately.

90
00:06:29,560 --> 00:06:35,720
So the McExperts didn't have to read hacked emails to find evidence of Tremburth's supposedly secret doubts.

91
00:06:35,720 --> 00:06:39,880
All they had to do was read his paper, available online.

92
00:06:39,880 --> 00:06:42,880
If this is a conspiracy, it's a very weird one.

93
00:06:42,880 --> 00:06:46,080
Surely at least one email would allude to this supposed hoax.

94
00:06:46,080 --> 00:06:51,800
Dr Spencer looked at this. He said this is too, too, too elaborate to be a hoax.

95
00:06:51,800 --> 00:06:55,800
Rush Limbaugh isn't talking about anthropogenic climate change here.

96
00:06:55,800 --> 00:06:59,160
No, he's talking about whether the emails were a hoax.

97
00:06:59,160 --> 00:07:03,760
Faking a thousand emails? No, says Limbaugh, that's too elaborate to be a hoax.

98
00:07:03,760 --> 00:07:09,800
But faking millions of points of data in thousands of scientific papers, in dozens of different scientific fields,

99
00:07:09,800 --> 00:07:14,800
and cross-matching them so that they all tell a story that's 180 degrees opposed to reality,

100
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:17,600
and making sure that no one blabs about it?

101
00:07:17,600 --> 00:07:20,040
Yep, Rush thinks that's what's happened.

102
00:07:20,040 --> 00:07:29,640
Bring these people to justice that they be trying for fraud. Billion-dollar, trillion-dollar fraud.

103
00:07:29,640 --> 00:07:30,640
Shut up!

104
00:07:30,640 --> 00:07:33,520
Now look, you don't know anything about this, see?

105
00:07:33,520 --> 00:07:35,320
No, no, I don't know nothing.

106
00:07:35,320 --> 00:07:42,240
The hackers got all the secret documents. It's in AP. It's in Washington Post.

107
00:07:42,240 --> 00:07:45,640
Sullivan picked it up at my home. He's got everything that was in my safe.

108
00:07:45,640 --> 00:07:49,240
Account books, receipts, names, addresses, bank books, everything.

109
00:07:50,240 --> 00:07:55,240
I've instinctively known this from the get-go from 20 years ago. The whole thing's made up.

110
00:07:55,240 --> 00:07:58,240
And the reason I know it is because liberals are behind it.

111
00:07:58,240 --> 00:08:02,240
I'm taking care of this job myself. Get Blackie up here right away.

112
00:08:02,240 --> 00:08:03,240
He's talking about a trick.

113
00:08:03,240 --> 00:08:05,240
Knowingly perpetuating fraud.

114
00:08:05,240 --> 00:08:09,240
The theory of global warming is a huge conspiracy.

115
00:08:09,240 --> 00:08:16,240
OK, before you all get too excited, too late, investigate what's been written and what it actually means.

116
00:08:16,240 --> 00:08:18,240
And hold off posting this message.

117
00:08:18,240 --> 00:08:21,240
Well, you were just putting your spin on this.

118
00:08:21,240 --> 00:08:24,240
If you think anything I've told you is incorrect, then check it.

119
00:08:24,240 --> 00:08:27,240
Check the use of the word trick in the scientific literature.

120
00:08:27,240 --> 00:08:32,240
And whether decline is referring to global temperatures or tree-ring proxies.

121
00:08:32,240 --> 00:08:37,240
Check Trembath's paper and whether his views are shared by Schneider and Wigley.

122
00:08:37,240 --> 00:08:40,240
And try to restrain your urge to post this message.

123
00:08:40,240 --> 00:08:44,240
The reason I'm talking about these two emails is that they're the ones that have been held up

124
00:08:44,240 --> 00:08:50,240
by every blogger and television fat mouth as the best and most obvious examples of this huge fraud.

125
00:08:50,240 --> 00:08:54,240
Whatever skullduggery there is will be investigated.

126
00:08:54,240 --> 00:09:01,240
But thankfully it won't be investigated by febrile nitwits who think proxy temperatures are the same as global temperatures

127
00:09:01,240 --> 00:09:04,240
and who aren't even aware of what's in the scientific literature.

128
00:09:04,240 --> 00:09:08,240
It'll be investigated by people who take the time to go over each message

129
00:09:08,240 --> 00:09:11,240
and who understand the science that's being discussed.

130
00:09:12,240 --> 00:09:16,240
And they'll come across emails most conspiracy theorists aren't even aware of.

131
00:09:16,240 --> 00:09:18,240
Like this one from Tom Wigley.

132
00:09:18,240 --> 00:09:23,240
This is a complex issue and your misrepresentation of it does you a disservice.

133
00:09:23,240 --> 00:09:28,240
To someone like me who knows the science, it's apparent that you're presenting a personal view,

134
00:09:28,240 --> 00:09:31,240
not an informed, balanced scientific assessment.

135
00:09:31,240 --> 00:09:35,240
Now you may think he's writing to a group of skeptics, but he's not.

136
00:09:35,240 --> 00:09:40,240
He's writing to a bunch of non-scientific academics, soliciting signatures for a letter,

137
00:09:40,240 --> 00:09:43,240
pushing for tougher controls on carbon emissions.

138
00:09:43,240 --> 00:09:46,240
And you won't see Glenn Beck quoting that.

139
00:09:46,240 --> 00:09:48,240
Say it with me.

140
00:09:48,240 --> 00:09:50,240
Conspiracy.

141
00:09:50,240 --> 00:09:52,240
Conspiracy.
