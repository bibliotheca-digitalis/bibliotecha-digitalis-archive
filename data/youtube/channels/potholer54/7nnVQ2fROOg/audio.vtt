00:00.000 --> 00:05.420
I've had to hold my series on climate change because apparently there's no need to explain the science anymore.

00:05.420 --> 00:11.520
Emails from the Climate Research Unit in the UK have been hacked, and it turns out the whole thing is a hoax.

00:11.520 --> 00:17.960
I'm pleased to see that Phil Jones, director of the Climate Research Unit, has stepped down while all this is investigated.

00:17.960 --> 00:21.660
But for the McExperts, an investigation simply isn't necessary.

00:21.660 --> 00:26.360
Even before any of them had had a chance to read the emails, they immediately had an opinion.

00:26.360 --> 00:33.720
A hacker seems to have uncovered evidence of substantial fraud in reporting the evidence on global warming.

00:33.720 --> 00:38.960
If your gut said, wait a minute, this global warming thing, it sounds like a scam, well, I think you're seeing it now.

00:39.520 --> 00:47.640
And the hacker's got all the secret documents, how they, how the big, fake environmentalists admit it's all a lie,

00:47.640 --> 00:55.160
the Earth is cooling, carbon dioxide's good for you, and these people knew it the whole time.

00:55.160 --> 00:57.680
Wow! Oh, the humanity!

00:57.680 --> 01:02.080
I'm not going to have time in this video to look at the bitchiness, the derogatory remarks,

01:02.080 --> 01:07.040
and the attempts to keep what the emailers regard as bad science out of the scientific literature.

01:07.040 --> 01:10.200
If you're interested in that, I'll be happy to make another video.

01:10.200 --> 01:16.160
What I want to look at in the time I've got available are examples of fraud uncovered by amateur skeptics,

01:16.160 --> 01:22.720
examples of figures being fudged, collusion on doctoring the numbers, and admissions that data have been fabricated.

01:22.720 --> 01:23.920
Here's an example.

01:23.920 --> 01:30.240
We both know the probable flaws in Mike's reconstruction, particularly as it relates to the tropical stuff.

01:30.240 --> 01:31.160
There you go.

01:31.160 --> 01:37.320
Cook and Briff are secretly admitting that they know there are flaws in the temperature reconstruction done by Mike Mann.

01:37.320 --> 01:46.000
The email goes on, the only way to deal with this whole issue is to show in a detailed study that his estimates are clearly deficient.

01:46.000 --> 01:48.280
Wait a minute, that can't be right.

01:48.280 --> 01:49.880
Okay, let's ditch that example.

01:49.880 --> 01:52.360
There are hundreds more that show a conspiracy.

01:52.360 --> 01:53.240
Look at this.

01:53.240 --> 02:01.600
I've just completed Mike's nature trick of adding in the real temps to each series for the last 20 years, i.e. from 1981 onwards,

02:01.600 --> 02:06.120
and from 1961 for Keith's to hide the decline.

02:06.120 --> 02:08.160
Okay, that's more like it.

02:08.160 --> 02:09.000
And look at this.

02:09.000 --> 02:14.800
The fact is we can't account for the lack of warming at the moment, and it is a travesty that we can't.

02:14.800 --> 02:17.080
Pretty damning, you've got to admit.

02:17.080 --> 02:18.360
Let's have another example.

02:18.360 --> 02:28.000
I have just completed Mike's nature trick of adding in the real temps to each series for the last 20 years to hide the decline.

02:28.000 --> 02:30.600
No, that's the same as the first one.

02:30.600 --> 02:36.400
The fact is we can't account for the lack of warming at the moment, and it's a travesty that we can't.

02:36.400 --> 02:38.600
Hang on, that's the second one again.

02:38.600 --> 02:40.120
I've just completed Mike's nature trick.

02:40.120 --> 02:41.320
Is this the same one, fat mouth?

02:41.320 --> 02:44.480
Of adding in the real temperatures to each series for the last...

02:44.520 --> 02:48.840
I've just completed Mike's nature trick of adding to the real temps to each...

02:48.840 --> 02:54.120
Some of these alleged emails may actually hold the key...

02:54.120 --> 02:55.920
I think I'm seeing a pattern here.

02:55.920 --> 03:03.840
Either these are by far the most egregious examples of fraud, or they're the only examples of fraud in 13 years of emails.

03:03.840 --> 03:07.800
Well, that's hardly the hoax of the century, but let's look at these two emails anyway.

03:07.800 --> 03:14.280
To hide the decline, that seems like deliberately changing the data to suit your way.

03:14.280 --> 03:17.400
Yes, that's certainly what it looks like, doesn't it, Stuart?

03:17.400 --> 03:22.760
Phil Jones's excuse is that researchers use the word trick to mean a clever thing to do.

03:22.760 --> 03:28.200
But if that's how it's used, I ought to find the same usage in the scientific literature, right?

03:28.200 --> 03:31.400
So I did a word search, and guess what?

03:31.400 --> 03:37.680
The word trick is commonly used in fields as far apart as chemistry, computer science and biology.

03:37.680 --> 03:40.800
And it seems to mean exactly what Jones says it means.

03:40.800 --> 03:46.040
If it really meant a piece of fraud, then all these scientists are admitting in their opening paragraphs

03:46.040 --> 03:49.840
that the scientific paper you're about to read is fraudulent.

03:49.840 --> 03:53.360
And that interpretation is just too stupid to be correct.

03:53.360 --> 03:55.920
But what about the term hide the decline?

03:55.920 --> 04:06.720
And from 1961, for Keith, to hide the decline, they're talking about the decline in the temperature, global temperature.

04:06.720 --> 04:13.320
If I had little understanding of climate science and little time to do any research, that's probably what I'd think too.

04:13.320 --> 04:16.800
But in fact, Jones was talking about something completely different.

04:16.800 --> 04:21.400
The apparent decline in temperatures shown by tree ring data since the 1950s.

04:21.400 --> 04:24.000
This has nothing to do with actual temperatures.

04:24.000 --> 04:27.720
It's about the responsiveness of tree rings to changes in climate.

04:27.720 --> 04:33.560
The argument is whether tree rings should be used when reconstructing pre-industrial climates.

04:33.560 --> 04:38.720
The word I honed in on wasn't trick or decline, but the word hide.

04:38.720 --> 04:44.600
Just what Jones meant, and whether there was a deliberate fudging of data, needs to be investigated.

04:44.600 --> 04:50.400
But whatever the outcome, this has nothing to do with whether the Earth has been warming since the mid-1970s

04:50.400 --> 04:54.440
or whether carbon dioxide is a greenhouse gas.

04:54.440 --> 04:57.360
So on to the other example of criminal fraud.

04:57.360 --> 05:02.800
We can't account for the lack of warming at the moment, and it is a travesty that we can.

05:02.800 --> 05:04.360
Well, that's self-explanatory.

05:04.360 --> 05:05.360
Is it?

05:05.360 --> 05:10.320
Kevin Tremburth is talking about cooling that was occurring in 2008-2009.

05:10.320 --> 05:14.000
The explanation most climatologists give is the obvious one.

05:14.000 --> 05:19.680
The Earth has been cooling for the last couple of years because we've been at the nadir of the 11-year solar cycle,

05:19.680 --> 05:23.280
and last year was a particularly strong La Niña year.

05:23.280 --> 05:26.640
I'll talk about the El Niño-La Niña cycle in a future video,

05:26.640 --> 05:32.560
but basically it's a cycle in which the South Pacific Ocean either absorbs or releases heat.

05:32.560 --> 05:39.520
Tremburth argues that the warming effect of carbon dioxide should be able to overcome these temporary cooling influences.

05:39.520 --> 05:43.960
If the McExperts had read the emails that preceded and followed Tremburth's,

05:43.960 --> 05:47.840
they would have seen that two other climatologists disagreed with him.

05:47.840 --> 05:51.760
So the first thing to note is that Tremburth seems to be expressing his own opinion,

05:51.760 --> 05:55.280
not necessarily that of the scientific community.

05:55.280 --> 05:59.320
But even if we accept that the scientists he's in correspondence with don't agree,

05:59.320 --> 06:02.360
the quote still shows that Tremburth is confessing in private

06:02.360 --> 06:07.120
that he can't explain the lack of warming, and publicly saying the complete opposite.

06:07.120 --> 06:08.520
Isn't he?

06:08.520 --> 06:12.880
I mean, isn't that what this conspiracy is all about? Covering up these secret doubts?

06:12.880 --> 06:16.840
Actually, if the blabbering McExperts had bothered to read his email more carefully,

06:16.840 --> 06:20.120
they would have seen that Tremburth was referring to a paper he'd written.

06:20.120 --> 06:22.160
He even gave us the URL.

06:22.160 --> 06:29.560
And if they'd bothered to click on it, they'd have found the paper he wrote expressing publicly the same doubts he expressed privately.

06:29.560 --> 06:35.720
So the McExperts didn't have to read hacked emails to find evidence of Tremburth's supposedly secret doubts.

06:35.720 --> 06:39.880
All they had to do was read his paper, available online.

06:39.880 --> 06:42.880
If this is a conspiracy, it's a very weird one.

06:42.880 --> 06:46.080
Surely at least one email would allude to this supposed hoax.

06:46.080 --> 06:51.800
Dr Spencer looked at this. He said this is too, too, too elaborate to be a hoax.

06:51.800 --> 06:55.800
Rush Limbaugh isn't talking about anthropogenic climate change here.

06:55.800 --> 06:59.160
No, he's talking about whether the emails were a hoax.

06:59.160 --> 07:03.760
Faking a thousand emails? No, says Limbaugh, that's too elaborate to be a hoax.

07:03.760 --> 07:09.800
But faking millions of points of data in thousands of scientific papers, in dozens of different scientific fields,

07:09.800 --> 07:14.800
and cross-matching them so that they all tell a story that's 180 degrees opposed to reality,

07:14.800 --> 07:17.600
and making sure that no one blabs about it?

07:17.600 --> 07:20.040
Yep, Rush thinks that's what's happened.

07:20.040 --> 07:29.640
Bring these people to justice that they be trying for fraud. Billion-dollar, trillion-dollar fraud.

07:29.640 --> 07:30.640
Shut up!

07:30.640 --> 07:33.520
Now look, you don't know anything about this, see?

07:33.520 --> 07:35.320
No, no, I don't know nothing.

07:35.320 --> 07:42.240
The hackers got all the secret documents. It's in AP. It's in Washington Post.

07:42.240 --> 07:45.640
Sullivan picked it up at my home. He's got everything that was in my safe.

07:45.640 --> 07:49.240
Account books, receipts, names, addresses, bank books, everything.

07:50.240 --> 07:55.240
I've instinctively known this from the get-go from 20 years ago. The whole thing's made up.

07:55.240 --> 07:58.240
And the reason I know it is because liberals are behind it.

07:58.240 --> 08:02.240
I'm taking care of this job myself. Get Blackie up here right away.

08:02.240 --> 08:03.240
He's talking about a trick.

08:03.240 --> 08:05.240
Knowingly perpetuating fraud.

08:05.240 --> 08:09.240
The theory of global warming is a huge conspiracy.

08:09.240 --> 08:16.240
OK, before you all get too excited, too late, investigate what's been written and what it actually means.

08:16.240 --> 08:18.240
And hold off posting this message.

08:18.240 --> 08:21.240
Well, you were just putting your spin on this.

08:21.240 --> 08:24.240
If you think anything I've told you is incorrect, then check it.

08:24.240 --> 08:27.240
Check the use of the word trick in the scientific literature.

08:27.240 --> 08:32.240
And whether decline is referring to global temperatures or tree-ring proxies.

08:32.240 --> 08:37.240
Check Trembath's paper and whether his views are shared by Schneider and Wigley.

08:37.240 --> 08:40.240
And try to restrain your urge to post this message.

08:40.240 --> 08:44.240
The reason I'm talking about these two emails is that they're the ones that have been held up

08:44.240 --> 08:50.240
by every blogger and television fat mouth as the best and most obvious examples of this huge fraud.

08:50.240 --> 08:54.240
Whatever skullduggery there is will be investigated.

08:54.240 --> 09:01.240
But thankfully it won't be investigated by febrile nitwits who think proxy temperatures are the same as global temperatures

09:01.240 --> 09:04.240
and who aren't even aware of what's in the scientific literature.

09:04.240 --> 09:08.240
It'll be investigated by people who take the time to go over each message

09:08.240 --> 09:11.240
and who understand the science that's being discussed.

09:12.240 --> 09:16.240
And they'll come across emails most conspiracy theorists aren't even aware of.

09:16.240 --> 09:18.240
Like this one from Tom Wigley.

09:18.240 --> 09:23.240
This is a complex issue and your misrepresentation of it does you a disservice.

09:23.240 --> 09:28.240
To someone like me who knows the science, it's apparent that you're presenting a personal view,

09:28.240 --> 09:31.240
not an informed, balanced scientific assessment.

09:31.240 --> 09:35.240
Now you may think he's writing to a group of skeptics, but he's not.

09:35.240 --> 09:40.240
He's writing to a bunch of non-scientific academics, soliciting signatures for a letter,

09:40.240 --> 09:43.240
pushing for tougher controls on carbon emissions.

09:43.240 --> 09:46.240
And you won't see Glenn Beck quoting that.

09:46.240 --> 09:48.240
Say it with me.

09:48.240 --> 09:50.240
Conspiracy.

09:50.240 --> 09:52.240
Conspiracy.
