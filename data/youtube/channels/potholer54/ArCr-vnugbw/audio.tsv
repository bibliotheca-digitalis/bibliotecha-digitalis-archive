0	10740	First off, the Miller experiments, the Miller experiments, we were talking about these primordial
10740	17680	experiments that were done in the laboratory back in the 1960s, and then they've been refined
17680	24820	and repeated over and over and over again in the lab.
24820	31780	They by no means suggest anything about building blocks of life, in fact, Miller got far more
31780	32780	tall.
32780	38740	In the experiment, what you fail to bring out is the fact that he had to build a special
38740	43540	trap in order to catch these amino acids and quickly separate them from the primordial
43540	47940	soup as they form so that they wouldn't be broken apart.
47940	64820	The amino acid, he literally, in every experiment done since then, literally has to build a
64820	70780	trap to separate them, which you would not find a trap in nature, you would not find
70780	81180	a trap in nature, you would not find a trap in nature.
81180	94860	So again, that invalidates Miller's experiment.
94860	100860	In addition to that, scientists also know that when it comes to producing proteins,
100860	112980	not only do you need amino acids, but the proteins are built of only left-handed types.
112980	135660	Studies of pre-cambium rock and cambium rock show us conclusively the insides of these
135660	139740	rocks have been oxidized.
139740	150060	There may have been over a million times more oxygen present in the early atmosphere than
150060	153140	estimated, theorized, or originally projected.
153140	164580	And if that's the case, in addition to that, it wouldn't matter whether
164580	174060	it was a primordial earth that lacked oxygen, there would not be a sufficient protection
174060	186700	from radiation coming in from outer space, so any developing light in it.
186700	191820	It couldn't have occurred in the oceans either, or any kind of water for that matter.
194580	202340	Water is the universal solvent, and it breaks things down by a process called hydrolysis.
202340	210380	Very effective at dissolving and breaking down many different substances, including
210380	215740	amino acid bonds, and for that matter, the vast majority of chemical bonds will break
215740	219420	down in water.
219420	229380	The vast majority of chemical bonds will break down in water, and that includes your
229380	242540	poly nucleotides.
242540	251700	In the book, In the RNA World, written by Leslie Orgel, Leslie Orgel, Leslie Orgel,
251700	262060	who is an evolutionist, and Gerald Joyce, an evolutionary microbiologist, they state
262060	266100	about the RNA world theory.
266100	271620	This discussion has, in a sense, focused on a straw man, the myth of a self-replicating
271620	277940	RNA molecule that arose de novo from a soup of random poly nucleotides.
277940	283900	Not only is such a notion unrealistic in light of our current understanding of prebiotic
283900	290900	chemistry, but it would strain the fragility of even the optimist view of RNA's catalytic
290900	292240	potential.
292240	300540	That is from Orgel and Gerald Joyce, eminent evolutionary microbiologist, and Orgel was
300540	309980	an assistant researcher with Miller at Crick, and he was there with Miller's experiments.
390540	418140	Thank you.
