1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,740
First off, the Miller experiments, the Miller experiments, we were talking about these primordial

2
00:00:10,740 --> 00:00:17,680
experiments that were done in the laboratory back in the 1960s, and then they've been refined

3
00:00:17,680 --> 00:00:24,820
and repeated over and over and over again in the lab.

4
00:00:24,820 --> 00:00:31,780
They by no means suggest anything about building blocks of life, in fact, Miller got far more

5
00:00:31,780 --> 00:00:32,780
tall.

6
00:00:32,780 --> 00:00:38,740
In the experiment, what you fail to bring out is the fact that he had to build a special

7
00:00:38,740 --> 00:00:43,540
trap in order to catch these amino acids and quickly separate them from the primordial

8
00:00:43,540 --> 00:00:47,940
soup as they form so that they wouldn't be broken apart.

9
00:00:47,940 --> 00:01:04,820
The amino acid, he literally, in every experiment done since then, literally has to build a

10
00:01:04,820 --> 00:01:10,780
trap to separate them, which you would not find a trap in nature, you would not find

11
00:01:10,780 --> 00:01:21,180
a trap in nature, you would not find a trap in nature.

12
00:01:21,180 --> 00:01:34,860
So again, that invalidates Miller's experiment.

13
00:01:34,860 --> 00:01:40,860
In addition to that, scientists also know that when it comes to producing proteins,

14
00:01:40,860 --> 00:01:52,980
not only do you need amino acids, but the proteins are built of only left-handed types.

15
00:01:52,980 --> 00:02:15,660
Studies of pre-cambium rock and cambium rock show us conclusively the insides of these

16
00:02:15,660 --> 00:02:19,740
rocks have been oxidized.

17
00:02:19,740 --> 00:02:30,060
There may have been over a million times more oxygen present in the early atmosphere than

18
00:02:30,060 --> 00:02:33,140
estimated, theorized, or originally projected.

19
00:02:33,140 --> 00:02:44,580
And if that's the case, in addition to that, it wouldn't matter whether

20
00:02:44,580 --> 00:02:54,060
it was a primordial earth that lacked oxygen, there would not be a sufficient protection

21
00:02:54,060 --> 00:03:06,700
from radiation coming in from outer space, so any developing light in it.

22
00:03:06,700 --> 00:03:11,820
It couldn't have occurred in the oceans either, or any kind of water for that matter.

23
00:03:14,580 --> 00:03:22,340
Water is the universal solvent, and it breaks things down by a process called hydrolysis.

24
00:03:22,340 --> 00:03:30,380
Very effective at dissolving and breaking down many different substances, including

25
00:03:30,380 --> 00:03:35,740
amino acid bonds, and for that matter, the vast majority of chemical bonds will break

26
00:03:35,740 --> 00:03:39,420
down in water.

27
00:03:39,420 --> 00:03:49,380
The vast majority of chemical bonds will break down in water, and that includes your

28
00:03:49,380 --> 00:04:02,540
poly nucleotides.

29
00:04:02,540 --> 00:04:11,700
In the book, In the RNA World, written by Leslie Orgel, Leslie Orgel, Leslie Orgel,

30
00:04:11,700 --> 00:04:22,060
who is an evolutionist, and Gerald Joyce, an evolutionary microbiologist, they state

31
00:04:22,060 --> 00:04:26,100
about the RNA world theory.

32
00:04:26,100 --> 00:04:31,620
This discussion has, in a sense, focused on a straw man, the myth of a self-replicating

33
00:04:31,620 --> 00:04:37,940
RNA molecule that arose de novo from a soup of random poly nucleotides.

34
00:04:37,940 --> 00:04:43,900
Not only is such a notion unrealistic in light of our current understanding of prebiotic

35
00:04:43,900 --> 00:04:50,900
chemistry, but it would strain the fragility of even the optimist view of RNA's catalytic

36
00:04:50,900 --> 00:04:52,240
potential.

37
00:04:52,240 --> 00:05:00,540
That is from Orgel and Gerald Joyce, eminent evolutionary microbiologist, and Orgel was

38
00:05:00,540 --> 00:05:09,980
an assistant researcher with Miller at Crick, and he was there with Miller's experiments.

39
00:06:30,540 --> 00:06:58,140
Thank you.
