00:00.000 --> 00:10.740
First off, the Miller experiments, the Miller experiments, we were talking about these primordial

00:10.740 --> 00:17.680
experiments that were done in the laboratory back in the 1960s, and then they've been refined

00:17.680 --> 00:24.820
and repeated over and over and over again in the lab.

00:24.820 --> 00:31.780
They by no means suggest anything about building blocks of life, in fact, Miller got far more

00:31.780 --> 00:32.780
tall.

00:32.780 --> 00:38.740
In the experiment, what you fail to bring out is the fact that he had to build a special

00:38.740 --> 00:43.540
trap in order to catch these amino acids and quickly separate them from the primordial

00:43.540 --> 00:47.940
soup as they form so that they wouldn't be broken apart.

00:47.940 --> 01:04.820
The amino acid, he literally, in every experiment done since then, literally has to build a

01:04.820 --> 01:10.780
trap to separate them, which you would not find a trap in nature, you would not find

01:10.780 --> 01:21.180
a trap in nature, you would not find a trap in nature.

01:21.180 --> 01:34.860
So again, that invalidates Miller's experiment.

01:34.860 --> 01:40.860
In addition to that, scientists also know that when it comes to producing proteins,

01:40.860 --> 01:52.980
not only do you need amino acids, but the proteins are built of only left-handed types.

01:52.980 --> 02:15.660
Studies of pre-cambium rock and cambium rock show us conclusively the insides of these

02:15.660 --> 02:19.740
rocks have been oxidized.

02:19.740 --> 02:30.060
There may have been over a million times more oxygen present in the early atmosphere than

02:30.060 --> 02:33.140
estimated, theorized, or originally projected.

02:33.140 --> 02:44.580
And if that's the case, in addition to that, it wouldn't matter whether

02:44.580 --> 02:54.060
it was a primordial earth that lacked oxygen, there would not be a sufficient protection

02:54.060 --> 03:06.700
from radiation coming in from outer space, so any developing light in it.

03:06.700 --> 03:11.820
It couldn't have occurred in the oceans either, or any kind of water for that matter.

03:14.580 --> 03:22.340
Water is the universal solvent, and it breaks things down by a process called hydrolysis.

03:22.340 --> 03:30.380
Very effective at dissolving and breaking down many different substances, including

03:30.380 --> 03:35.740
amino acid bonds, and for that matter, the vast majority of chemical bonds will break

03:35.740 --> 03:39.420
down in water.

03:39.420 --> 03:49.380
The vast majority of chemical bonds will break down in water, and that includes your

03:49.380 --> 04:02.540
poly nucleotides.

04:02.540 --> 04:11.700
In the book, In the RNA World, written by Leslie Orgel, Leslie Orgel, Leslie Orgel,

04:11.700 --> 04:22.060
who is an evolutionist, and Gerald Joyce, an evolutionary microbiologist, they state

04:22.060 --> 04:26.100
about the RNA world theory.

04:26.100 --> 04:31.620
This discussion has, in a sense, focused on a straw man, the myth of a self-replicating

04:31.620 --> 04:37.940
RNA molecule that arose de novo from a soup of random poly nucleotides.

04:37.940 --> 04:43.900
Not only is such a notion unrealistic in light of our current understanding of prebiotic

04:43.900 --> 04:50.900
chemistry, but it would strain the fragility of even the optimist view of RNA's catalytic

04:50.900 --> 04:52.240
potential.

04:52.240 --> 05:00.540
That is from Orgel and Gerald Joyce, eminent evolutionary microbiologist, and Orgel was

05:00.540 --> 05:09.980
an assistant researcher with Miller at Crick, and he was there with Miller's experiments.

06:30.540 --> 06:58.140
Thank you.
