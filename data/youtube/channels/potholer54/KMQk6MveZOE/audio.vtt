00:00.000 --> 00:13.920
In part one of this video I looked at our growing knowledge of the universe and how

00:13.920 --> 00:18.440
humans became aware of its scale in time and space.

00:18.440 --> 00:23.580
Now I want to explain what that knowledge tells us about how our universe unfolded,

00:23.580 --> 00:29.300
how the stars and galaxies formed and how the earth was created, not by magic but by

00:29.340 --> 00:32.140
physical processes we know and understand.

00:32.140 --> 00:46.940
Our universe, which may be one of several in time and space, started with a huge explosion

00:46.940 --> 00:52.940
of energy and matter called the Big Bang. Neutrons, protons and electrons rode in the

00:52.940 --> 01:00.260
wake of an expansion of time and space itself. After 380,000 years the universe had cooled

01:00.260 --> 01:06.140
enough for these particles to come together to form the first atoms. Nearly three quarters

01:06.140 --> 01:13.140
of them were simple hydrogen, just one proton and one electron. 28% were helium, which has

01:13.140 --> 01:21.240
two protons, two neutrons and two electrons. Cosmologists thought this cloud of matter

01:21.240 --> 01:27.140
must have been patchy, denser in some parts than others, otherwise the denser parts couldn't

01:27.140 --> 01:33.100
have come together later to form stars. Based on the state of our present universe and theoretical

01:33.100 --> 01:38.120
models of the Big Bang, they predicted what this patchy early universe would have looked

01:38.120 --> 01:43.880
like. Denser clouds are always a few millionths of a degree warmer than the emptier parts

01:43.880 --> 01:49.840
of our cosmos, so cosmologists knew that if they could look back 13 billion years they

01:49.840 --> 01:54.760
should be able to see the heat imprint of these early clouds of particles. They'd have

01:54.760 --> 02:03.640
to find background temperatures from the universe's furthest reaches. The instrument that achieved

02:03.640 --> 02:10.040
this was NASA's Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe. It spent two years collecting data

02:10.040 --> 02:15.780
from 13 billion light years away, which meant it was not only looking deep into space, but

02:15.780 --> 02:22.980
also 13 billion years back in time. Then in 2003 the picture was ready and the world

02:22.980 --> 02:29.580
caught its first glimpse of our universe at birth. What you're looking at is a picture

02:29.580 --> 02:37.580
of our universe just 380,000 years after it was born, as the first atoms were being formed.

02:37.580 --> 02:43.580
It's like seeing the photo of an 80 year old man, just 19 hours after his birth. The red

02:43.580 --> 02:50.380
areas are warmer clouds of matter, the blue areas colder and emptier. Hydrogen and helium,

02:50.380 --> 02:56.540
protons and neutrons, drifting in a dark cosmos. The Wilkinson probe results were hailed as

02:56.540 --> 03:03.180
a scientific breakthrough. They matched the predictions perfectly. Over millions of years

03:03.180 --> 03:08.740
gravitational attraction pulled many of these denser clouds of matter closer together, and

03:08.740 --> 03:13.940
the more dense they became, the greater the gravitational attraction. Just as a spinning

03:13.940 --> 03:19.800
skater spins faster when she pulls in her outstretched arms, each swirling cloud began

03:19.800 --> 03:26.380
to spin, until they became tight balls of rotating gas. Inside each ball of gas the

03:26.380 --> 03:32.360
pressure increased. Whenever a gas is compressed it heats up, so hydrogen atoms in the centre

03:32.360 --> 03:37.020
of the cloud started vibrating faster and faster, until they were crashing into each

03:37.020 --> 03:43.820
other at such high speed they began to fuse to form helium. Each nuclear fusion reaction

03:43.820 --> 03:48.900
is accompanied by the release of energy. The energy makes other hydrogen atoms vibrate

03:48.900 --> 03:54.740
even faster, fusing more of them, releasing more energy that fuses more atoms, and in

03:54.740 --> 04:01.020
a split second a chain reaction. Like trillions of hydrogen bombs exploding at once, the ball

04:01.020 --> 04:27.780
of gas ignites. The first stars illuminate the cosmos. Early swarms of stars were also

04:27.780 --> 04:33.940
drawn together by gravitation forming galaxies. The first stars burned for billions of years

04:33.940 --> 04:41.620
powered by fusion. But a star has only so much hydrogen fuel. As the energy is used

04:41.620 --> 04:46.940
up, the star begins to collapse, pulling the gas ball tighter. Pressure and temperature

04:46.940 --> 04:52.540
increase until they are high enough for helium atoms to crash together and fuse. This makes

04:52.540 --> 04:58.500
heavier atoms like carbon and then oxygen. With higher temperatures and pressures even

04:58.500 --> 05:06.060
these atoms fuse until the star becomes a white hot factory forging every element. The

05:06.060 --> 05:11.460
energy from these reactions is far greater than the fusion of hydrogen. Finally the temperature

05:11.460 --> 05:18.100
and pressure are so high that the star explodes, spewing its contents into space. Often the

05:18.100 --> 05:22.900
shockwaves throw these heavier elements against clouds of hydrogen and helium that have been

05:22.900 --> 05:28.300
dormant in space for billions of years. This cloud hadn't been dense enough to pull together

05:28.300 --> 05:34.220
under gravitation, but the sudden jolt from the exploded star stirs it. Now gravitation

05:34.220 --> 05:40.700
starts to pull the denser areas closer together. The life cycle of a star begins again.

05:54.700 --> 06:02.180
Only this time things are different. This time the cloud of gas is laden with heavier elements.

06:02.180 --> 06:08.060
Thanks to spectroscopy explained in part one of this video, we can measure the proportion of

06:08.060 --> 06:13.540
the different elements in stars and in our own Sun. Because stars have been forming since our

06:13.540 --> 06:18.580
universe began, we can see them in all their different stages of development, from their

06:18.580 --> 06:28.380
inception, to birth, maturity, old age and death. So we know the rate at which hydrogen and helium

06:28.380 --> 06:34.380
fuse. The proportion of the two elements tells us the age of the star. Our Sun is about halfway

06:34.380 --> 06:40.660
through its life cycle, which makes it about five billion years old. So five billion years ago a

06:40.660 --> 06:46.300
nondescript cloud of gas must have come together in this way and formed a medium-sized rather

06:46.300 --> 06:52.980
nondescript star on the edge of a very ordinary spiral galaxy. As it formed, the heavier elements

06:52.980 --> 06:58.820
in the cloud created rings of dust in orbit. Over time these came together under gravitational

06:58.820 --> 07:06.380
attraction to make tiny rocks, then larger rocks, a process known as accretion. This isn't an

07:06.380 --> 07:11.860
extraordinary process. In our tiny corner of the universe alone, cosmologists have detected

07:11.860 --> 07:18.020
hundreds of planets, so there could be billions of them in just our galaxy. Some would be too

07:18.020 --> 07:24.260
close to a star and water would boil away in the intense heat. Others would be too far and water

07:24.260 --> 07:30.500
would freeze. But for any planet in an orbit between those two extremes, water would be liquid,

07:30.500 --> 07:36.940
just like on Earth. Within a few hundred million years accretion had created a huge ball of rock

07:36.940 --> 07:42.180
that would become our planet. At first it was molten because of the energy of millions of

07:42.180 --> 07:48.620
collisions. Then the molten ball began to cool and a hardened crust formed over it. A few million

07:48.620 --> 07:54.060
years after it formed, the Earth was cool enough for water to condense and over the next billion

07:54.060 --> 08:00.240
years chemical reactions created replicating molecules that would one day evolve into simple

08:00.240 --> 08:06.540
cells. In the two parts of this video we've seen how our universe, our Sun and eventually our

08:06.540 --> 08:14.260
planet, formed over a period of 13.7 billion years without any need for invisible beings. So

08:14.260 --> 08:20.580
we know the universe wasn't made in six days and of course we know it's a lot more than 6,500 years

08:20.580 --> 08:26.500
old. If you want to believe in a recent mythical creation then you've missed out on a lot of the

08:26.500 --> 08:32.420
incredible advances in knowledge over the last 300 years. You've also missed out on something

08:32.420 --> 08:37.700
that would have astonished the four thousand generations of humans who preceded us and who

08:37.700 --> 08:43.060
were so curious about the creation of our world that they had to invent gods and spirits to

08:43.060 --> 08:48.500
explain it. They would never have dreamed that one day would have the technology to look back

08:48.500 --> 08:54.780
in time nearly 14 billion years and take a snapshot of the birth of our universe.
