0	13920	In part one of this video I looked at our growing knowledge of the universe and how
13920	18440	humans became aware of its scale in time and space.
18440	23580	Now I want to explain what that knowledge tells us about how our universe unfolded,
23580	29300	how the stars and galaxies formed and how the earth was created, not by magic but by
29340	32140	physical processes we know and understand.
32140	46940	Our universe, which may be one of several in time and space, started with a huge explosion
46940	52940	of energy and matter called the Big Bang. Neutrons, protons and electrons rode in the
52940	60260	wake of an expansion of time and space itself. After 380,000 years the universe had cooled
60260	66140	enough for these particles to come together to form the first atoms. Nearly three quarters
66140	73140	of them were simple hydrogen, just one proton and one electron. 28% were helium, which has
73140	81240	two protons, two neutrons and two electrons. Cosmologists thought this cloud of matter
81240	87140	must have been patchy, denser in some parts than others, otherwise the denser parts couldn't
87140	93100	have come together later to form stars. Based on the state of our present universe and theoretical
93100	98120	models of the Big Bang, they predicted what this patchy early universe would have looked
98120	103880	like. Denser clouds are always a few millionths of a degree warmer than the emptier parts
103880	109840	of our cosmos, so cosmologists knew that if they could look back 13 billion years they
109840	114760	should be able to see the heat imprint of these early clouds of particles. They'd have
114760	123640	to find background temperatures from the universe's furthest reaches. The instrument that achieved
123640	130040	this was NASA's Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe. It spent two years collecting data
130040	135780	from 13 billion light years away, which meant it was not only looking deep into space, but
135780	142980	also 13 billion years back in time. Then in 2003 the picture was ready and the world
142980	149580	caught its first glimpse of our universe at birth. What you're looking at is a picture
149580	157580	of our universe just 380,000 years after it was born, as the first atoms were being formed.
157580	163580	It's like seeing the photo of an 80 year old man, just 19 hours after his birth. The red
163580	170380	areas are warmer clouds of matter, the blue areas colder and emptier. Hydrogen and helium,
170380	176540	protons and neutrons, drifting in a dark cosmos. The Wilkinson probe results were hailed as
176540	183180	a scientific breakthrough. They matched the predictions perfectly. Over millions of years
183180	188740	gravitational attraction pulled many of these denser clouds of matter closer together, and
188740	193940	the more dense they became, the greater the gravitational attraction. Just as a spinning
193940	199800	skater spins faster when she pulls in her outstretched arms, each swirling cloud began
199800	206380	to spin, until they became tight balls of rotating gas. Inside each ball of gas the
206380	212360	pressure increased. Whenever a gas is compressed it heats up, so hydrogen atoms in the centre
212360	217020	of the cloud started vibrating faster and faster, until they were crashing into each
217020	223820	other at such high speed they began to fuse to form helium. Each nuclear fusion reaction
223820	228900	is accompanied by the release of energy. The energy makes other hydrogen atoms vibrate
228900	234740	even faster, fusing more of them, releasing more energy that fuses more atoms, and in
234740	241020	a split second a chain reaction. Like trillions of hydrogen bombs exploding at once, the ball
241020	267780	of gas ignites. The first stars illuminate the cosmos. Early swarms of stars were also
267780	273940	drawn together by gravitation forming galaxies. The first stars burned for billions of years
273940	281620	powered by fusion. But a star has only so much hydrogen fuel. As the energy is used
281620	286940	up, the star begins to collapse, pulling the gas ball tighter. Pressure and temperature
286940	292540	increase until they are high enough for helium atoms to crash together and fuse. This makes
292540	298500	heavier atoms like carbon and then oxygen. With higher temperatures and pressures even
298500	306060	these atoms fuse until the star becomes a white hot factory forging every element. The
306060	311460	energy from these reactions is far greater than the fusion of hydrogen. Finally the temperature
311460	318100	and pressure are so high that the star explodes, spewing its contents into space. Often the
318100	322900	shockwaves throw these heavier elements against clouds of hydrogen and helium that have been
322900	328300	dormant in space for billions of years. This cloud hadn't been dense enough to pull together
328300	334220	under gravitation, but the sudden jolt from the exploded star stirs it. Now gravitation
334220	340700	starts to pull the denser areas closer together. The life cycle of a star begins again.
354700	362180	Only this time things are different. This time the cloud of gas is laden with heavier elements.
362180	368060	Thanks to spectroscopy explained in part one of this video, we can measure the proportion of
368060	373540	the different elements in stars and in our own Sun. Because stars have been forming since our
373540	378580	universe began, we can see them in all their different stages of development, from their
378580	388380	inception, to birth, maturity, old age and death. So we know the rate at which hydrogen and helium
388380	394380	fuse. The proportion of the two elements tells us the age of the star. Our Sun is about halfway
394380	400660	through its life cycle, which makes it about five billion years old. So five billion years ago a
400660	406300	nondescript cloud of gas must have come together in this way and formed a medium-sized rather
406300	412980	nondescript star on the edge of a very ordinary spiral galaxy. As it formed, the heavier elements
412980	418820	in the cloud created rings of dust in orbit. Over time these came together under gravitational
418820	426380	attraction to make tiny rocks, then larger rocks, a process known as accretion. This isn't an
426380	431860	extraordinary process. In our tiny corner of the universe alone, cosmologists have detected
431860	438020	hundreds of planets, so there could be billions of them in just our galaxy. Some would be too
438020	444260	close to a star and water would boil away in the intense heat. Others would be too far and water
444260	450500	would freeze. But for any planet in an orbit between those two extremes, water would be liquid,
450500	456940	just like on Earth. Within a few hundred million years accretion had created a huge ball of rock
456940	462180	that would become our planet. At first it was molten because of the energy of millions of
462180	468620	collisions. Then the molten ball began to cool and a hardened crust formed over it. A few million
468620	474060	years after it formed, the Earth was cool enough for water to condense and over the next billion
474060	480240	years chemical reactions created replicating molecules that would one day evolve into simple
480240	486540	cells. In the two parts of this video we've seen how our universe, our Sun and eventually our
486540	494260	planet, formed over a period of 13.7 billion years without any need for invisible beings. So
494260	500580	we know the universe wasn't made in six days and of course we know it's a lot more than 6,500 years
500580	506500	old. If you want to believe in a recent mythical creation then you've missed out on a lot of the
506500	512420	incredible advances in knowledge over the last 300 years. You've also missed out on something
512420	517700	that would have astonished the four thousand generations of humans who preceded us and who
517700	523060	were so curious about the creation of our world that they had to invent gods and spirits to
523060	528500	explain it. They would never have dreamed that one day would have the technology to look back
528500	534780	in time nearly 14 billion years and take a snapshot of the birth of our universe.
