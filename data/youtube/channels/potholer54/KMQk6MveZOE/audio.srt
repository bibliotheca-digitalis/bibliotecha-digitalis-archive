00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:13,920
In part one of this video I looked at our growing knowledge of the universe and how

2
00:00:13,920 --> 00:00:18,440
humans became aware of its scale in time and space.

3
00:00:18,440 --> 00:00:23,580
Now I want to explain what that knowledge tells us about how our universe unfolded,

4
00:00:23,580 --> 00:00:29,300
how the stars and galaxies formed and how the earth was created, not by magic but by

5
00:00:29,340 --> 00:00:32,140
physical processes we know and understand.

6
00:00:32,140 --> 00:00:46,940
Our universe, which may be one of several in time and space, started with a huge explosion

7
00:00:46,940 --> 00:00:52,940
of energy and matter called the Big Bang. Neutrons, protons and electrons rode in the

8
00:00:52,940 --> 00:01:00,260
wake of an expansion of time and space itself. After 380,000 years the universe had cooled

9
00:01:00,260 --> 00:01:06,140
enough for these particles to come together to form the first atoms. Nearly three quarters

10
00:01:06,140 --> 00:01:13,140
of them were simple hydrogen, just one proton and one electron. 28% were helium, which has

11
00:01:13,140 --> 00:01:21,240
two protons, two neutrons and two electrons. Cosmologists thought this cloud of matter

12
00:01:21,240 --> 00:01:27,140
must have been patchy, denser in some parts than others, otherwise the denser parts couldn't

13
00:01:27,140 --> 00:01:33,100
have come together later to form stars. Based on the state of our present universe and theoretical

14
00:01:33,100 --> 00:01:38,120
models of the Big Bang, they predicted what this patchy early universe would have looked

15
00:01:38,120 --> 00:01:43,880
like. Denser clouds are always a few millionths of a degree warmer than the emptier parts

16
00:01:43,880 --> 00:01:49,840
of our cosmos, so cosmologists knew that if they could look back 13 billion years they

17
00:01:49,840 --> 00:01:54,760
should be able to see the heat imprint of these early clouds of particles. They'd have

18
00:01:54,760 --> 00:02:03,640
to find background temperatures from the universe's furthest reaches. The instrument that achieved

19
00:02:03,640 --> 00:02:10,040
this was NASA's Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe. It spent two years collecting data

20
00:02:10,040 --> 00:02:15,780
from 13 billion light years away, which meant it was not only looking deep into space, but

21
00:02:15,780 --> 00:02:22,980
also 13 billion years back in time. Then in 2003 the picture was ready and the world

22
00:02:22,980 --> 00:02:29,580
caught its first glimpse of our universe at birth. What you're looking at is a picture

23
00:02:29,580 --> 00:02:37,580
of our universe just 380,000 years after it was born, as the first atoms were being formed.

24
00:02:37,580 --> 00:02:43,580
It's like seeing the photo of an 80 year old man, just 19 hours after his birth. The red

25
00:02:43,580 --> 00:02:50,380
areas are warmer clouds of matter, the blue areas colder and emptier. Hydrogen and helium,

26
00:02:50,380 --> 00:02:56,540
protons and neutrons, drifting in a dark cosmos. The Wilkinson probe results were hailed as

27
00:02:56,540 --> 00:03:03,180
a scientific breakthrough. They matched the predictions perfectly. Over millions of years

28
00:03:03,180 --> 00:03:08,740
gravitational attraction pulled many of these denser clouds of matter closer together, and

29
00:03:08,740 --> 00:03:13,940
the more dense they became, the greater the gravitational attraction. Just as a spinning

30
00:03:13,940 --> 00:03:19,800
skater spins faster when she pulls in her outstretched arms, each swirling cloud began

31
00:03:19,800 --> 00:03:26,380
to spin, until they became tight balls of rotating gas. Inside each ball of gas the

32
00:03:26,380 --> 00:03:32,360
pressure increased. Whenever a gas is compressed it heats up, so hydrogen atoms in the centre

33
00:03:32,360 --> 00:03:37,020
of the cloud started vibrating faster and faster, until they were crashing into each

34
00:03:37,020 --> 00:03:43,820
other at such high speed they began to fuse to form helium. Each nuclear fusion reaction

35
00:03:43,820 --> 00:03:48,900
is accompanied by the release of energy. The energy makes other hydrogen atoms vibrate

36
00:03:48,900 --> 00:03:54,740
even faster, fusing more of them, releasing more energy that fuses more atoms, and in

37
00:03:54,740 --> 00:04:01,020
a split second a chain reaction. Like trillions of hydrogen bombs exploding at once, the ball

38
00:04:01,020 --> 00:04:27,780
of gas ignites. The first stars illuminate the cosmos. Early swarms of stars were also

39
00:04:27,780 --> 00:04:33,940
drawn together by gravitation forming galaxies. The first stars burned for billions of years

40
00:04:33,940 --> 00:04:41,620
powered by fusion. But a star has only so much hydrogen fuel. As the energy is used

41
00:04:41,620 --> 00:04:46,940
up, the star begins to collapse, pulling the gas ball tighter. Pressure and temperature

42
00:04:46,940 --> 00:04:52,540
increase until they are high enough for helium atoms to crash together and fuse. This makes

43
00:04:52,540 --> 00:04:58,500
heavier atoms like carbon and then oxygen. With higher temperatures and pressures even

44
00:04:58,500 --> 00:05:06,060
these atoms fuse until the star becomes a white hot factory forging every element. The

45
00:05:06,060 --> 00:05:11,460
energy from these reactions is far greater than the fusion of hydrogen. Finally the temperature

46
00:05:11,460 --> 00:05:18,100
and pressure are so high that the star explodes, spewing its contents into space. Often the

47
00:05:18,100 --> 00:05:22,900
shockwaves throw these heavier elements against clouds of hydrogen and helium that have been

48
00:05:22,900 --> 00:05:28,300
dormant in space for billions of years. This cloud hadn't been dense enough to pull together

49
00:05:28,300 --> 00:05:34,220
under gravitation, but the sudden jolt from the exploded star stirs it. Now gravitation

50
00:05:34,220 --> 00:05:40,700
starts to pull the denser areas closer together. The life cycle of a star begins again.

51
00:05:54,700 --> 00:06:02,180
Only this time things are different. This time the cloud of gas is laden with heavier elements.

52
00:06:02,180 --> 00:06:08,060
Thanks to spectroscopy explained in part one of this video, we can measure the proportion of

53
00:06:08,060 --> 00:06:13,540
the different elements in stars and in our own Sun. Because stars have been forming since our

54
00:06:13,540 --> 00:06:18,580
universe began, we can see them in all their different stages of development, from their

55
00:06:18,580 --> 00:06:28,380
inception, to birth, maturity, old age and death. So we know the rate at which hydrogen and helium

56
00:06:28,380 --> 00:06:34,380
fuse. The proportion of the two elements tells us the age of the star. Our Sun is about halfway

57
00:06:34,380 --> 00:06:40,660
through its life cycle, which makes it about five billion years old. So five billion years ago a

58
00:06:40,660 --> 00:06:46,300
nondescript cloud of gas must have come together in this way and formed a medium-sized rather

59
00:06:46,300 --> 00:06:52,980
nondescript star on the edge of a very ordinary spiral galaxy. As it formed, the heavier elements

60
00:06:52,980 --> 00:06:58,820
in the cloud created rings of dust in orbit. Over time these came together under gravitational

61
00:06:58,820 --> 00:07:06,380
attraction to make tiny rocks, then larger rocks, a process known as accretion. This isn't an

62
00:07:06,380 --> 00:07:11,860
extraordinary process. In our tiny corner of the universe alone, cosmologists have detected

63
00:07:11,860 --> 00:07:18,020
hundreds of planets, so there could be billions of them in just our galaxy. Some would be too

64
00:07:18,020 --> 00:07:24,260
close to a star and water would boil away in the intense heat. Others would be too far and water

65
00:07:24,260 --> 00:07:30,500
would freeze. But for any planet in an orbit between those two extremes, water would be liquid,

66
00:07:30,500 --> 00:07:36,940
just like on Earth. Within a few hundred million years accretion had created a huge ball of rock

67
00:07:36,940 --> 00:07:42,180
that would become our planet. At first it was molten because of the energy of millions of

68
00:07:42,180 --> 00:07:48,620
collisions. Then the molten ball began to cool and a hardened crust formed over it. A few million

69
00:07:48,620 --> 00:07:54,060
years after it formed, the Earth was cool enough for water to condense and over the next billion

70
00:07:54,060 --> 00:08:00,240
years chemical reactions created replicating molecules that would one day evolve into simple

71
00:08:00,240 --> 00:08:06,540
cells. In the two parts of this video we've seen how our universe, our Sun and eventually our

72
00:08:06,540 --> 00:08:14,260
planet, formed over a period of 13.7 billion years without any need for invisible beings. So

73
00:08:14,260 --> 00:08:20,580
we know the universe wasn't made in six days and of course we know it's a lot more than 6,500 years

74
00:08:20,580 --> 00:08:26,500
old. If you want to believe in a recent mythical creation then you've missed out on a lot of the

75
00:08:26,500 --> 00:08:32,420
incredible advances in knowledge over the last 300 years. You've also missed out on something

76
00:08:32,420 --> 00:08:37,700
that would have astonished the four thousand generations of humans who preceded us and who

77
00:08:37,700 --> 00:08:43,060
were so curious about the creation of our world that they had to invent gods and spirits to

78
00:08:43,060 --> 00:08:48,500
explain it. They would never have dreamed that one day would have the technology to look back

79
00:08:48,500 --> 00:08:54,780
in time nearly 14 billion years and take a snapshot of the birth of our universe.
