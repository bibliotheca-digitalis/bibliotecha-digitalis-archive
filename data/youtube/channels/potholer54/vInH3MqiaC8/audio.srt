1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,120
This is coal, don't be afraid, don't be scared, the Treasurer knows the rule on crops, it's

2
00:00:06,120 --> 00:00:07,120
coal.

3
00:00:07,120 --> 00:00:11,240
When Scott Morrison brandished a lump of coal in the Australian Parliament, it was a signal

4
00:00:11,240 --> 00:00:14,840
to the world that this is coal country.

5
00:00:14,840 --> 00:00:19,260
Coal is one of Australia's biggest export commodities, generating billions of dollars

6
00:00:19,260 --> 00:00:26,040
in trade, and it provides electricity to power Australian manufacturing and light-up homes.

7
00:00:26,040 --> 00:00:30,720
This coal-fired power station, for example, is crucial for powering the state of South

8
00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:31,720
Australia.

9
00:00:31,720 --> 00:00:37,080
That's why Scott Morrison, the Prime Minister, made such an impassioned speech that our economic

10
00:00:37,080 --> 00:00:40,080
survival depends on keeping these people alive.

11
00:00:40,080 --> 00:00:43,600
What the f**k?

12
00:00:43,600 --> 00:00:48,240
Well that's a stroke of bad luck.

13
00:00:48,240 --> 00:00:53,560
But no, this wasn't an accident or a terrorist act plunging South Australia into darkness.

14
00:00:54,080 --> 00:01:00,520
It's the last coal-fired power station being decommissioned by its owners in 2016.

15
00:01:00,520 --> 00:01:03,560
So how's the state doing without any power?

16
00:01:03,560 --> 00:01:06,760
Actually, it's doing quite well.

17
00:01:06,760 --> 00:01:12,020
This statistic astonished me when I heard it, and maybe you'll be bowled over too.

18
00:01:12,020 --> 00:01:17,600
If it was an independent country, South Australia would now rank second in the world after Denmark

19
00:01:17,600 --> 00:01:20,940
in the use of variable renewable power.

20
00:01:20,940 --> 00:01:25,840
It's doing what so many people in the federal government claimed was impossible and is thriving

21
00:01:25,840 --> 00:01:28,300
on renewable energy.

22
00:01:28,300 --> 00:01:32,620
Now before cynics start flooding the comments section with questions about what happens

23
00:01:32,620 --> 00:01:37,320
when the sun doesn't shine and the wind doesn't blow, let's backtrack a little.

24
00:01:37,320 --> 00:01:42,280
In 2006, South Australia had almost no renewable energy at all.

25
00:01:42,280 --> 00:01:45,420
It was dependent on coal and gas.

26
00:01:45,420 --> 00:01:50,140
Then under a left-of-centre laboured state government, South Australia began replacing

27
00:01:50,140 --> 00:01:52,740
them with wind and solar power.

28
00:01:52,740 --> 00:01:58,380
It had an ambitious plan to produce 50% of its power from renewable resources.

29
00:01:58,380 --> 00:02:04,460
By contrast, the national targets were 50% renewable by 2050.

30
00:02:04,460 --> 00:02:09,540
Within just ten years, South Australia had replaced all its coal-fired power with renewable

31
00:02:09,540 --> 00:02:14,940
power and that's when it decommissioned the last of its coal-fired power stations.

32
00:02:14,940 --> 00:02:17,300
What could possibly go wrong?

33
00:02:17,300 --> 00:02:21,620
The move towards renewable energy was heavily criticised by the federal government, which

34
00:02:21,620 --> 00:02:25,900
was run by the right-of-centre Liberal National Coalition.

35
00:02:25,900 --> 00:02:28,740
I know the word liberal is confusing here.

36
00:02:28,740 --> 00:02:34,060
Unlike Canada, the Liberal Party in Australia is the Conservative Party on the right of

37
00:02:34,060 --> 00:02:35,340
politics.

38
00:02:35,340 --> 00:02:39,700
In other words, it's this, not this.

39
00:02:39,700 --> 00:02:44,340
So why don't I just call them Conservatives to avoid confusion?

40
00:02:44,340 --> 00:02:49,420
After a huge storm caused blackouts across the state in 2016, federal government leaders

41
00:02:49,420 --> 00:02:55,180
called South Australia's move towards renewable energy a failed experiment.

42
00:02:55,180 --> 00:02:59,180
Businesses are investing millions of dollars in back-up generators.

43
00:02:59,180 --> 00:03:04,100
That's the great achievement of the Labor Party's energy policy in South Australia.

44
00:03:04,100 --> 00:03:11,140
They invited in this high uptake of renewables, the highest on a per capita basis anywhere

45
00:03:11,140 --> 00:03:12,660
in the world.

46
00:03:12,660 --> 00:03:14,540
Now this big experiment failed.

47
00:03:14,540 --> 00:03:17,980
Actually, the story is a bit more complicated than that.

48
00:03:17,980 --> 00:03:23,180
The main cause of the state-wide blackout was infrastructure damage caused by a storm,

49
00:03:23,180 --> 00:03:26,260
but some of the criticism was justified.

50
00:03:26,260 --> 00:03:30,860
Power was intermittent when renewable sources weren't working and South Australia had the

51
00:03:30,860 --> 00:03:34,740
second most expensive electricity in the country.

52
00:03:34,740 --> 00:03:37,620
And this was something of an experiment.

53
00:03:37,620 --> 00:03:41,980
So even beyond the storm and the blackout, there was a problem with South Australia's

54
00:03:41,980 --> 00:03:44,380
renewable energy programme.

55
00:03:44,380 --> 00:03:49,060
At times the system was producing way too much energy that couldn't be stored and at

56
00:03:49,060 --> 00:03:54,100
other times it wasn't producing enough and had no back-up, except to import electricity

57
00:03:54,100 --> 00:03:56,580
from neighbouring states.

58
00:03:56,580 --> 00:04:01,500
So the South Australian government decided to get around the problem with another experiment,

59
00:04:01,500 --> 00:04:06,600
the world's largest battery, to be built by Tesla at a place called Hornsdale.

60
00:04:06,600 --> 00:04:12,360
This is going to be the largest battery installation in the world by a significant margin.

61
00:04:12,360 --> 00:04:17,600
This is a 100 megawatt battery installation, the next biggest battery system in the world

62
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:18,600
is 30 megawatts.

63
00:04:18,600 --> 00:04:22,960
So we're talking about something that is more than three times as powerful as the next biggest

64
00:04:22,960 --> 00:04:24,440
battery installation in the world.

65
00:04:24,440 --> 00:04:29,960
And because so far this story is playing out along stereotypical political lines, a battery

66
00:04:29,960 --> 00:04:34,960
must be left-wing, so the politically correct position for a Conservative government has

67
00:04:34,960 --> 00:04:35,960
to be this.

68
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:39,200
That means have the world's biggest battery, have the world's biggest banana, have the

69
00:04:39,200 --> 00:04:44,600
world's biggest prawn, like we have on the roadside along highways around the country.

70
00:04:44,600 --> 00:04:46,400
But that's not solving the problem.

71
00:04:46,400 --> 00:04:50,400
Well there's only one way to find out, but hold on because I still haven't finished the

72
00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:51,400
story.

73
00:04:51,400 --> 00:04:58,420
In 2018 there was an election in South Australia and the idealistic, Chardonnay-sipping, politically

74
00:04:58,420 --> 00:05:05,720
correct, green-loving, snowflake, lefty government, led by Jay Weatherill, got booted out.

75
00:05:05,720 --> 00:05:09,440
Then in his place came the new Premier, Stephen Marshall.

76
00:05:09,440 --> 00:05:10,440
Hang on, that's not right.

77
00:05:10,440 --> 00:05:11,440
Oh, there he is.

78
00:05:11,440 --> 00:05:14,840
It's a joke, I know him, he won't mind.

79
00:05:14,840 --> 00:05:19,240
Anyway, he came to power heading the tough-talking, right-wing, shoot-first-asked-questions-later

80
00:05:19,240 --> 00:05:24,160
macho government of the Liberal Party, the same party of Australia's current Prime Minister

81
00:05:24,160 --> 00:05:25,880
Scott Morrison.

82
00:05:25,880 --> 00:05:27,840
The Party of Coal.

83
00:05:27,840 --> 00:05:32,200
So now that they're back in power in South Australia, they're going to fulfil their promises

84
00:05:32,200 --> 00:05:37,880
to pull back the reckless targets for renewable energy, cancel the battery deal with Tesla

85
00:05:37,880 --> 00:05:42,920
and go back to using electricity based on the tough, manly pursuit of digging up and

86
00:05:42,920 --> 00:05:45,760
burning coal, right?

87
00:05:45,760 --> 00:05:47,480
But no, they didn't.

88
00:05:47,480 --> 00:05:53,280
They realised that the experiment was succeeding, for reasons we'll see, and that consumers,

89
00:05:53,280 --> 00:05:57,320
energy companies and industry wanted to keep it.

90
00:05:57,320 --> 00:06:02,040
So instead of scrapping the green-loving snowflake lefty programme, the new Conservative

91
00:06:02,040 --> 00:06:05,000
government massively expanded it.

92
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:10,240
New and bigger wind and solar farms were planned and built, and the target for renewable energy

93
00:06:10,240 --> 00:06:12,480
was raised even higher.

94
00:06:12,480 --> 00:06:16,720
Even the Hornsdale battery was enlarged, and this time, for some reason, there were no

95
00:06:16,720 --> 00:06:19,120
comparisons to a big banana.

96
00:06:19,120 --> 00:06:20,740
I wonder why.

97
00:06:20,740 --> 00:06:26,960
So under a right-wing government, South Australia is now at 70% renewable energy and aiming

98
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:30,520
for 90% by 2025.

99
00:06:30,520 --> 00:06:34,800
Senior politicians in the federal government had warned that the push for renewables in

100
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:41,720
South Australia would lead to an unreliable power supply and higher electricity prices.

101
00:06:41,720 --> 00:06:46,680
The reality is that since the Hornsdale battery has been built, the electricity supply in

102
00:06:46,680 --> 00:06:53,000
South Australia has been pretty stable and even has advantages over coal and gas.

103
00:06:53,040 --> 00:06:57,080
One of the headaches of grid engineers is trying to regulate the output of electricity

104
00:06:57,080 --> 00:07:01,720
from power stations to meet demand, which varies throughout the day.

105
00:07:01,720 --> 00:07:07,140
Here's the response time of coal and gas-fired power stations, and here's the response

106
00:07:07,140 --> 00:07:11,520
time of the Hornsdale battery, which is measured in milliseconds.

107
00:07:11,520 --> 00:07:17,520
For energy companies, this is less wasteful, much more economical and much more efficient.

108
00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:21,560
The Hornsdale battery has been so successful that it has produced windfall profits for

109
00:07:21,600 --> 00:07:27,640
its owner, the French company Nihon, and paid for itself within just a few years, and so

110
00:07:27,640 --> 00:07:33,680
successful that it has been expanded from 100MW to 150MW.

111
00:07:33,680 --> 00:07:38,120
As for the cost of renewable energy, it's now so cheap that South Australia has turned

112
00:07:38,120 --> 00:07:43,480
from having the second most expensive electricity in Australia during the coal-burning era to

113
00:07:43,480 --> 00:07:45,600
the cheapest.

114
00:07:45,600 --> 00:07:50,400
And the renewable energy programme has sparked new industries and innovations, like Sundrop

115
00:07:50,400 --> 00:07:56,060
Farm, which is using solar energy to turn seawater into freshwater.

116
00:07:56,060 --> 00:08:01,520
Prior to this innovation, the semi-arid land on which the farm sits was only able to support

117
00:08:01,520 --> 00:08:03,240
three cows.

118
00:08:03,240 --> 00:08:09,600
Now it has an abundance of water taken from the sea and produces 14% of Australia's

119
00:08:09,600 --> 00:08:10,600
tomatoes.

120
00:08:10,600 --> 00:08:15,640
And for people who have no idea what those are, they're tomatoes.

121
00:08:15,640 --> 00:08:19,520
Government officials in South Australia also have their eye on attracting international

122
00:08:19,520 --> 00:08:25,440
firms that need cheap renewable energy as a power source, because increasingly countries

123
00:08:25,440 --> 00:08:30,240
that are signed up to treaties limiting carbon emissions will penalise companies that have

124
00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:32,460
a high carbon footprint.

125
00:08:32,460 --> 00:08:36,340
Whether you agree with that or not, that's the reality.

126
00:08:36,340 --> 00:08:40,620
And this is how we now get to the current position of South Australia having the second

127
00:08:40,620 --> 00:08:47,180
highest uptake of variable renewable energy in the world, if it was an independent country.

128
00:08:47,180 --> 00:08:53,220
The state government not only met its renewable energy targets, it exceeded them.

129
00:08:53,220 --> 00:08:59,340
But for some pundits speaking in the year 2020, it's still 1995.

130
00:08:59,340 --> 00:09:06,100
Renewables are nice if they work, but they're expensive, unreliable, impractical and frankly

131
00:09:06,100 --> 00:09:07,100
a bit of a con.

132
00:09:07,100 --> 00:09:12,300
I guess that after pushing the same message for 20 years, based on technology that's

133
00:09:12,300 --> 00:09:16,460
30 years old, it's hard to change direction.

134
00:09:16,460 --> 00:09:21,820
The success of renewable energy in South Australia is reflected in plans to build a huge renewable

135
00:09:21,820 --> 00:09:29,500
energy hub that will produce 1.2 GW of wind and 600 MW of solar, packed up by a battery

136
00:09:29,500 --> 00:09:36,260
with 1.8 GW of storage, ten times bigger than the original Hornsdale battery.

137
00:09:36,260 --> 00:09:40,920
So South Australia could soon be producing far more electricity than it needs, nearly

138
00:09:40,920 --> 00:09:46,020
all from wind and solar, and much cheaper than neighbouring states.

139
00:09:46,020 --> 00:09:49,500
What will it do with all that cheap, clean energy?

140
00:09:49,500 --> 00:09:54,600
One answer, which is now being trialled with a pilot plant, is to split water molecules

141
00:09:54,600 --> 00:09:59,940
and produce hydrogen, and then export it to countries like Japan and South Korea that

142
00:09:59,940 --> 00:10:06,660
are also switching away from coal and oil, and looking ahead to a hydrogen-fuelled economy.

143
00:10:06,660 --> 00:10:10,060
Liquid sunshine, as one Australian engineer described it.

144
00:10:10,060 --> 00:10:15,060
I spoke about this in my video A Conservative Solution to Climate Change.

145
00:10:15,100 --> 00:10:19,980
This video is really a practical example of what I was saying in that video, which of

146
00:10:19,980 --> 00:10:24,700
course was all my opinion, a vision of the future that's not calling for world government

147
00:10:24,700 --> 00:10:30,740
and state control, but a free enterprise solution that should be easily adopted by both sides

148
00:10:30,740 --> 00:10:32,820
of the political equation.

149
00:10:32,820 --> 00:10:37,060
Now we can see what happens when we put that into practice.

150
00:10:37,060 --> 00:10:41,740
A measure of the success in South Australia is that other states like Victoria and New

151
00:10:41,740 --> 00:10:46,940
South Wales are now trying to emulate it, building similar renewable energy farms backed

152
00:10:46,940 --> 00:10:48,900
by battery storage.

153
00:10:48,900 --> 00:10:51,900
And again, this goes across party lines.

154
00:10:51,900 --> 00:10:57,100
New South Wales has a Conservative government, Victoria is left wing.

155
00:10:57,100 --> 00:11:02,780
In another video, my previous one, I asked the question, do you get it now, and clearly

156
00:11:02,780 --> 00:11:07,900
most of the states do, but there's also some encouraging news in the media.

157
00:11:07,900 --> 00:11:12,940
News International, which dominates Australia's media and is owned by Rupert Murdoch, who

158
00:11:12,940 --> 00:11:18,740
also owns Fox News, the Wall Street Journal and the New York Post, has spent decades downplaying

159
00:11:18,740 --> 00:11:24,540
or even denying the link between carbon dioxide and global temperature, and of course, rubbishing

160
00:11:24,540 --> 00:11:26,940
renewable energy.

161
00:11:26,940 --> 00:11:32,140
But almost overnight, it's announced a major editorial shift.

162
00:11:32,140 --> 00:11:36,780
Apparently they do now accept the science, at least here in Australia.

163
00:11:36,780 --> 00:11:41,380
They finally figured out that carbon dioxide does cause global warming and that something

164
00:11:41,380 --> 00:11:46,820
needs to be done about it, and that renewable energy is now a good thing.

165
00:11:46,820 --> 00:11:50,940
After scientists had been warning about this for decades, Murdoch and his editors suddenly

166
00:11:50,940 --> 00:11:52,980
decided they were right.

167
00:11:52,980 --> 00:11:57,880
But during those decades, News International has been spoon-feeding millions of readers

168
00:11:57,880 --> 00:12:04,660
and viewers a steady diet of slanted scientific nonsense that I've been debunking on my channel,

169
00:12:04,660 --> 00:12:09,860
splashing opinions from scientists with no qualifications in climate science and pundits

170
00:12:09,860 --> 00:12:16,060
who never passed high school science and even an op-ed piece written by a special correspondent

171
00:12:16,060 --> 00:12:20,980
who turned out to be an anonymous flak working for a resources industry lobby group.

172
00:12:20,980 --> 00:12:27,100
Well, I suppose it took the Roman Catholic Church over 350 years to finally admit that

173
00:12:27,100 --> 00:12:32,640
Galileo was right, the Earth does orbit the Sun, and it took creationists half a century

174
00:12:32,640 --> 00:12:38,380
to admit that animals do change over time, to the point where they can no longer interbreed.

175
00:12:38,380 --> 00:12:44,640
So it does take a while for entrenched ideological and religious beliefs to finally succumb to

176
00:12:44,640 --> 00:12:45,640
science.

177
00:12:45,640 --> 00:12:50,760
But isn't it nice to see what can be done when everyone does listen to the science and

178
00:12:50,760 --> 00:12:53,120
the ideological bickering stops?

179
00:13:02,640 --> 00:13:03,640
Thank you.

180
00:13:03,640 --> 00:13:03,640
