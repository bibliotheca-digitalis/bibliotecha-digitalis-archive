0	6120	This is coal, don't be afraid, don't be scared, the Treasurer knows the rule on crops, it's
6120	7120	coal.
7120	11240	When Scott Morrison brandished a lump of coal in the Australian Parliament, it was a signal
11240	14840	to the world that this is coal country.
14840	19260	Coal is one of Australia's biggest export commodities, generating billions of dollars
19260	26040	in trade, and it provides electricity to power Australian manufacturing and light-up homes.
26040	30720	This coal-fired power station, for example, is crucial for powering the state of South
30720	31720	Australia.
31720	37080	That's why Scott Morrison, the Prime Minister, made such an impassioned speech that our economic
37080	40080	survival depends on keeping these people alive.
40080	43600	What the f**k?
43600	48240	Well that's a stroke of bad luck.
48240	53560	But no, this wasn't an accident or a terrorist act plunging South Australia into darkness.
54080	60520	It's the last coal-fired power station being decommissioned by its owners in 2016.
60520	63560	So how's the state doing without any power?
63560	66760	Actually, it's doing quite well.
66760	72020	This statistic astonished me when I heard it, and maybe you'll be bowled over too.
72020	77600	If it was an independent country, South Australia would now rank second in the world after Denmark
77600	80940	in the use of variable renewable power.
80940	85840	It's doing what so many people in the federal government claimed was impossible and is thriving
85840	88300	on renewable energy.
88300	92620	Now before cynics start flooding the comments section with questions about what happens
92620	97320	when the sun doesn't shine and the wind doesn't blow, let's backtrack a little.
97320	102280	In 2006, South Australia had almost no renewable energy at all.
102280	105420	It was dependent on coal and gas.
105420	110140	Then under a left-of-centre laboured state government, South Australia began replacing
110140	112740	them with wind and solar power.
112740	118380	It had an ambitious plan to produce 50% of its power from renewable resources.
118380	124460	By contrast, the national targets were 50% renewable by 2050.
124460	129540	Within just ten years, South Australia had replaced all its coal-fired power with renewable
129540	134940	power and that's when it decommissioned the last of its coal-fired power stations.
134940	137300	What could possibly go wrong?
137300	141620	The move towards renewable energy was heavily criticised by the federal government, which
141620	145900	was run by the right-of-centre Liberal National Coalition.
145900	148740	I know the word liberal is confusing here.
148740	154060	Unlike Canada, the Liberal Party in Australia is the Conservative Party on the right of
154060	155340	politics.
155340	159700	In other words, it's this, not this.
159700	164340	So why don't I just call them Conservatives to avoid confusion?
164340	169420	After a huge storm caused blackouts across the state in 2016, federal government leaders
169420	175180	called South Australia's move towards renewable energy a failed experiment.
175180	179180	Businesses are investing millions of dollars in back-up generators.
179180	184100	That's the great achievement of the Labor Party's energy policy in South Australia.
184100	191140	They invited in this high uptake of renewables, the highest on a per capita basis anywhere
191140	192660	in the world.
192660	194540	Now this big experiment failed.
194540	197980	Actually, the story is a bit more complicated than that.
197980	203180	The main cause of the state-wide blackout was infrastructure damage caused by a storm,
203180	206260	but some of the criticism was justified.
206260	210860	Power was intermittent when renewable sources weren't working and South Australia had the
210860	214740	second most expensive electricity in the country.
214740	217620	And this was something of an experiment.
217620	221980	So even beyond the storm and the blackout, there was a problem with South Australia's
221980	224380	renewable energy programme.
224380	229060	At times the system was producing way too much energy that couldn't be stored and at
229060	234100	other times it wasn't producing enough and had no back-up, except to import electricity
234100	236580	from neighbouring states.
236580	241500	So the South Australian government decided to get around the problem with another experiment,
241500	246600	the world's largest battery, to be built by Tesla at a place called Hornsdale.
246600	252360	This is going to be the largest battery installation in the world by a significant margin.
252360	257600	This is a 100 megawatt battery installation, the next biggest battery system in the world
257600	258600	is 30 megawatts.
258600	262960	So we're talking about something that is more than three times as powerful as the next biggest
262960	264440	battery installation in the world.
264440	269960	And because so far this story is playing out along stereotypical political lines, a battery
269960	274960	must be left-wing, so the politically correct position for a Conservative government has
274960	275960	to be this.
276000	279200	That means have the world's biggest battery, have the world's biggest banana, have the
279200	284600	world's biggest prawn, like we have on the roadside along highways around the country.
284600	286400	But that's not solving the problem.
286400	290400	Well there's only one way to find out, but hold on because I still haven't finished the
290400	291400	story.
291400	298420	In 2018 there was an election in South Australia and the idealistic, Chardonnay-sipping, politically
298420	305720	correct, green-loving, snowflake, lefty government, led by Jay Weatherill, got booted out.
305720	309440	Then in his place came the new Premier, Stephen Marshall.
309440	310440	Hang on, that's not right.
310440	311440	Oh, there he is.
311440	314840	It's a joke, I know him, he won't mind.
314840	319240	Anyway, he came to power heading the tough-talking, right-wing, shoot-first-asked-questions-later
319240	324160	macho government of the Liberal Party, the same party of Australia's current Prime Minister
324160	325880	Scott Morrison.
325880	327840	The Party of Coal.
327840	332200	So now that they're back in power in South Australia, they're going to fulfil their promises
332200	337880	to pull back the reckless targets for renewable energy, cancel the battery deal with Tesla
337880	342920	and go back to using electricity based on the tough, manly pursuit of digging up and
342920	345760	burning coal, right?
345760	347480	But no, they didn't.
347480	353280	They realised that the experiment was succeeding, for reasons we'll see, and that consumers,
353280	357320	energy companies and industry wanted to keep it.
357320	362040	So instead of scrapping the green-loving snowflake lefty programme, the new Conservative
362040	365000	government massively expanded it.
365000	370240	New and bigger wind and solar farms were planned and built, and the target for renewable energy
370240	372480	was raised even higher.
372480	376720	Even the Hornsdale battery was enlarged, and this time, for some reason, there were no
376720	379120	comparisons to a big banana.
379120	380740	I wonder why.
380740	386960	So under a right-wing government, South Australia is now at 70% renewable energy and aiming
387000	390520	for 90% by 2025.
390520	394800	Senior politicians in the federal government had warned that the push for renewables in
394800	401720	South Australia would lead to an unreliable power supply and higher electricity prices.
401720	406680	The reality is that since the Hornsdale battery has been built, the electricity supply in
406680	413000	South Australia has been pretty stable and even has advantages over coal and gas.
413040	417080	One of the headaches of grid engineers is trying to regulate the output of electricity
417080	421720	from power stations to meet demand, which varies throughout the day.
421720	427140	Here's the response time of coal and gas-fired power stations, and here's the response
427140	431520	time of the Hornsdale battery, which is measured in milliseconds.
431520	437520	For energy companies, this is less wasteful, much more economical and much more efficient.
437520	441560	The Hornsdale battery has been so successful that it has produced windfall profits for
441600	447640	its owner, the French company Nihon, and paid for itself within just a few years, and so
447640	453680	successful that it has been expanded from 100MW to 150MW.
453680	458120	As for the cost of renewable energy, it's now so cheap that South Australia has turned
458120	463480	from having the second most expensive electricity in Australia during the coal-burning era to
463480	465600	the cheapest.
465600	470400	And the renewable energy programme has sparked new industries and innovations, like Sundrop
470400	476060	Farm, which is using solar energy to turn seawater into freshwater.
476060	481520	Prior to this innovation, the semi-arid land on which the farm sits was only able to support
481520	483240	three cows.
483240	489600	Now it has an abundance of water taken from the sea and produces 14% of Australia's
489600	490600	tomatoes.
490600	495640	And for people who have no idea what those are, they're tomatoes.
495640	499520	Government officials in South Australia also have their eye on attracting international
499520	505440	firms that need cheap renewable energy as a power source, because increasingly countries
505440	510240	that are signed up to treaties limiting carbon emissions will penalise companies that have
510240	512460	a high carbon footprint.
512460	516340	Whether you agree with that or not, that's the reality.
516340	520620	And this is how we now get to the current position of South Australia having the second
520620	527180	highest uptake of variable renewable energy in the world, if it was an independent country.
527180	533220	The state government not only met its renewable energy targets, it exceeded them.
533220	539340	But for some pundits speaking in the year 2020, it's still 1995.
539340	546100	Renewables are nice if they work, but they're expensive, unreliable, impractical and frankly
546100	547100	a bit of a con.
547100	552300	I guess that after pushing the same message for 20 years, based on technology that's
552300	556460	30 years old, it's hard to change direction.
556460	561820	The success of renewable energy in South Australia is reflected in plans to build a huge renewable
561820	569500	energy hub that will produce 1.2 GW of wind and 600 MW of solar, packed up by a battery
569500	576260	with 1.8 GW of storage, ten times bigger than the original Hornsdale battery.
576260	580920	So South Australia could soon be producing far more electricity than it needs, nearly
580920	586020	all from wind and solar, and much cheaper than neighbouring states.
586020	589500	What will it do with all that cheap, clean energy?
589500	594600	One answer, which is now being trialled with a pilot plant, is to split water molecules
594600	599940	and produce hydrogen, and then export it to countries like Japan and South Korea that
599940	606660	are also switching away from coal and oil, and looking ahead to a hydrogen-fuelled economy.
606660	610060	Liquid sunshine, as one Australian engineer described it.
610060	615060	I spoke about this in my video A Conservative Solution to Climate Change.
615100	619980	This video is really a practical example of what I was saying in that video, which of
619980	624700	course was all my opinion, a vision of the future that's not calling for world government
624700	630740	and state control, but a free enterprise solution that should be easily adopted by both sides
630740	632820	of the political equation.
632820	637060	Now we can see what happens when we put that into practice.
637060	641740	A measure of the success in South Australia is that other states like Victoria and New
641740	646940	South Wales are now trying to emulate it, building similar renewable energy farms backed
646940	648900	by battery storage.
648900	651900	And again, this goes across party lines.
651900	657100	New South Wales has a Conservative government, Victoria is left wing.
657100	662780	In another video, my previous one, I asked the question, do you get it now, and clearly
662780	667900	most of the states do, but there's also some encouraging news in the media.
667900	672940	News International, which dominates Australia's media and is owned by Rupert Murdoch, who
672940	678740	also owns Fox News, the Wall Street Journal and the New York Post, has spent decades downplaying
678740	684540	or even denying the link between carbon dioxide and global temperature, and of course, rubbishing
684540	686940	renewable energy.
686940	692140	But almost overnight, it's announced a major editorial shift.
692140	696780	Apparently they do now accept the science, at least here in Australia.
696780	701380	They finally figured out that carbon dioxide does cause global warming and that something
701380	706820	needs to be done about it, and that renewable energy is now a good thing.
706820	710940	After scientists had been warning about this for decades, Murdoch and his editors suddenly
710940	712980	decided they were right.
712980	717880	But during those decades, News International has been spoon-feeding millions of readers
717880	724660	and viewers a steady diet of slanted scientific nonsense that I've been debunking on my channel,
724660	729860	splashing opinions from scientists with no qualifications in climate science and pundits
729860	736060	who never passed high school science and even an op-ed piece written by a special correspondent
736060	740980	who turned out to be an anonymous flak working for a resources industry lobby group.
740980	747100	Well, I suppose it took the Roman Catholic Church over 350 years to finally admit that
747100	752640	Galileo was right, the Earth does orbit the Sun, and it took creationists half a century
752640	758380	to admit that animals do change over time, to the point where they can no longer interbreed.
758380	764640	So it does take a while for entrenched ideological and religious beliefs to finally succumb to
764640	765640	science.
765640	770760	But isn't it nice to see what can be done when everyone does listen to the science and
770760	773120	the ideological bickering stops?
782640	783640	Thank you.
783640	783640
