00:00.000 --> 00:06.120
This is coal, don't be afraid, don't be scared, the Treasurer knows the rule on crops, it's

00:06.120 --> 00:07.120
coal.

00:07.120 --> 00:11.240
When Scott Morrison brandished a lump of coal in the Australian Parliament, it was a signal

00:11.240 --> 00:14.840
to the world that this is coal country.

00:14.840 --> 00:19.260
Coal is one of Australia's biggest export commodities, generating billions of dollars

00:19.260 --> 00:26.040
in trade, and it provides electricity to power Australian manufacturing and light-up homes.

00:26.040 --> 00:30.720
This coal-fired power station, for example, is crucial for powering the state of South

00:30.720 --> 00:31.720
Australia.

00:31.720 --> 00:37.080
That's why Scott Morrison, the Prime Minister, made such an impassioned speech that our economic

00:37.080 --> 00:40.080
survival depends on keeping these people alive.

00:40.080 --> 00:43.600
What the f**k?

00:43.600 --> 00:48.240
Well that's a stroke of bad luck.

00:48.240 --> 00:53.560
But no, this wasn't an accident or a terrorist act plunging South Australia into darkness.

00:54.080 --> 01:00.520
It's the last coal-fired power station being decommissioned by its owners in 2016.

01:00.520 --> 01:03.560
So how's the state doing without any power?

01:03.560 --> 01:06.760
Actually, it's doing quite well.

01:06.760 --> 01:12.020
This statistic astonished me when I heard it, and maybe you'll be bowled over too.

01:12.020 --> 01:17.600
If it was an independent country, South Australia would now rank second in the world after Denmark

01:17.600 --> 01:20.940
in the use of variable renewable power.

01:20.940 --> 01:25.840
It's doing what so many people in the federal government claimed was impossible and is thriving

01:25.840 --> 01:28.300
on renewable energy.

01:28.300 --> 01:32.620
Now before cynics start flooding the comments section with questions about what happens

01:32.620 --> 01:37.320
when the sun doesn't shine and the wind doesn't blow, let's backtrack a little.

01:37.320 --> 01:42.280
In 2006, South Australia had almost no renewable energy at all.

01:42.280 --> 01:45.420
It was dependent on coal and gas.

01:45.420 --> 01:50.140
Then under a left-of-centre laboured state government, South Australia began replacing

01:50.140 --> 01:52.740
them with wind and solar power.

01:52.740 --> 01:58.380
It had an ambitious plan to produce 50% of its power from renewable resources.

01:58.380 --> 02:04.460
By contrast, the national targets were 50% renewable by 2050.

02:04.460 --> 02:09.540
Within just ten years, South Australia had replaced all its coal-fired power with renewable

02:09.540 --> 02:14.940
power and that's when it decommissioned the last of its coal-fired power stations.

02:14.940 --> 02:17.300
What could possibly go wrong?

02:17.300 --> 02:21.620
The move towards renewable energy was heavily criticised by the federal government, which

02:21.620 --> 02:25.900
was run by the right-of-centre Liberal National Coalition.

02:25.900 --> 02:28.740
I know the word liberal is confusing here.

02:28.740 --> 02:34.060
Unlike Canada, the Liberal Party in Australia is the Conservative Party on the right of

02:34.060 --> 02:35.340
politics.

02:35.340 --> 02:39.700
In other words, it's this, not this.

02:39.700 --> 02:44.340
So why don't I just call them Conservatives to avoid confusion?

02:44.340 --> 02:49.420
After a huge storm caused blackouts across the state in 2016, federal government leaders

02:49.420 --> 02:55.180
called South Australia's move towards renewable energy a failed experiment.

02:55.180 --> 02:59.180
Businesses are investing millions of dollars in back-up generators.

02:59.180 --> 03:04.100
That's the great achievement of the Labor Party's energy policy in South Australia.

03:04.100 --> 03:11.140
They invited in this high uptake of renewables, the highest on a per capita basis anywhere

03:11.140 --> 03:12.660
in the world.

03:12.660 --> 03:14.540
Now this big experiment failed.

03:14.540 --> 03:17.980
Actually, the story is a bit more complicated than that.

03:17.980 --> 03:23.180
The main cause of the state-wide blackout was infrastructure damage caused by a storm,

03:23.180 --> 03:26.260
but some of the criticism was justified.

03:26.260 --> 03:30.860
Power was intermittent when renewable sources weren't working and South Australia had the

03:30.860 --> 03:34.740
second most expensive electricity in the country.

03:34.740 --> 03:37.620
And this was something of an experiment.

03:37.620 --> 03:41.980
So even beyond the storm and the blackout, there was a problem with South Australia's

03:41.980 --> 03:44.380
renewable energy programme.

03:44.380 --> 03:49.060
At times the system was producing way too much energy that couldn't be stored and at

03:49.060 --> 03:54.100
other times it wasn't producing enough and had no back-up, except to import electricity

03:54.100 --> 03:56.580
from neighbouring states.

03:56.580 --> 04:01.500
So the South Australian government decided to get around the problem with another experiment,

04:01.500 --> 04:06.600
the world's largest battery, to be built by Tesla at a place called Hornsdale.

04:06.600 --> 04:12.360
This is going to be the largest battery installation in the world by a significant margin.

04:12.360 --> 04:17.600
This is a 100 megawatt battery installation, the next biggest battery system in the world

04:17.600 --> 04:18.600
is 30 megawatts.

04:18.600 --> 04:22.960
So we're talking about something that is more than three times as powerful as the next biggest

04:22.960 --> 04:24.440
battery installation in the world.

04:24.440 --> 04:29.960
And because so far this story is playing out along stereotypical political lines, a battery

04:29.960 --> 04:34.960
must be left-wing, so the politically correct position for a Conservative government has

04:34.960 --> 04:35.960
to be this.

04:36.000 --> 04:39.200
That means have the world's biggest battery, have the world's biggest banana, have the

04:39.200 --> 04:44.600
world's biggest prawn, like we have on the roadside along highways around the country.

04:44.600 --> 04:46.400
But that's not solving the problem.

04:46.400 --> 04:50.400
Well there's only one way to find out, but hold on because I still haven't finished the

04:50.400 --> 04:51.400
story.

04:51.400 --> 04:58.420
In 2018 there was an election in South Australia and the idealistic, Chardonnay-sipping, politically

04:58.420 --> 05:05.720
correct, green-loving, snowflake, lefty government, led by Jay Weatherill, got booted out.

05:05.720 --> 05:09.440
Then in his place came the new Premier, Stephen Marshall.

05:09.440 --> 05:10.440
Hang on, that's not right.

05:10.440 --> 05:11.440
Oh, there he is.

05:11.440 --> 05:14.840
It's a joke, I know him, he won't mind.

05:14.840 --> 05:19.240
Anyway, he came to power heading the tough-talking, right-wing, shoot-first-asked-questions-later

05:19.240 --> 05:24.160
macho government of the Liberal Party, the same party of Australia's current Prime Minister

05:24.160 --> 05:25.880
Scott Morrison.

05:25.880 --> 05:27.840
The Party of Coal.

05:27.840 --> 05:32.200
So now that they're back in power in South Australia, they're going to fulfil their promises

05:32.200 --> 05:37.880
to pull back the reckless targets for renewable energy, cancel the battery deal with Tesla

05:37.880 --> 05:42.920
and go back to using electricity based on the tough, manly pursuit of digging up and

05:42.920 --> 05:45.760
burning coal, right?

05:45.760 --> 05:47.480
But no, they didn't.

05:47.480 --> 05:53.280
They realised that the experiment was succeeding, for reasons we'll see, and that consumers,

05:53.280 --> 05:57.320
energy companies and industry wanted to keep it.

05:57.320 --> 06:02.040
So instead of scrapping the green-loving snowflake lefty programme, the new Conservative

06:02.040 --> 06:05.000
government massively expanded it.

06:05.000 --> 06:10.240
New and bigger wind and solar farms were planned and built, and the target for renewable energy

06:10.240 --> 06:12.480
was raised even higher.

06:12.480 --> 06:16.720
Even the Hornsdale battery was enlarged, and this time, for some reason, there were no

06:16.720 --> 06:19.120
comparisons to a big banana.

06:19.120 --> 06:20.740
I wonder why.

06:20.740 --> 06:26.960
So under a right-wing government, South Australia is now at 70% renewable energy and aiming

06:27.000 --> 06:30.520
for 90% by 2025.

06:30.520 --> 06:34.800
Senior politicians in the federal government had warned that the push for renewables in

06:34.800 --> 06:41.720
South Australia would lead to an unreliable power supply and higher electricity prices.

06:41.720 --> 06:46.680
The reality is that since the Hornsdale battery has been built, the electricity supply in

06:46.680 --> 06:53.000
South Australia has been pretty stable and even has advantages over coal and gas.

06:53.040 --> 06:57.080
One of the headaches of grid engineers is trying to regulate the output of electricity

06:57.080 --> 07:01.720
from power stations to meet demand, which varies throughout the day.

07:01.720 --> 07:07.140
Here's the response time of coal and gas-fired power stations, and here's the response

07:07.140 --> 07:11.520
time of the Hornsdale battery, which is measured in milliseconds.

07:11.520 --> 07:17.520
For energy companies, this is less wasteful, much more economical and much more efficient.

07:17.520 --> 07:21.560
The Hornsdale battery has been so successful that it has produced windfall profits for

07:21.600 --> 07:27.640
its owner, the French company Nihon, and paid for itself within just a few years, and so

07:27.640 --> 07:33.680
successful that it has been expanded from 100MW to 150MW.

07:33.680 --> 07:38.120
As for the cost of renewable energy, it's now so cheap that South Australia has turned

07:38.120 --> 07:43.480
from having the second most expensive electricity in Australia during the coal-burning era to

07:43.480 --> 07:45.600
the cheapest.

07:45.600 --> 07:50.400
And the renewable energy programme has sparked new industries and innovations, like Sundrop

07:50.400 --> 07:56.060
Farm, which is using solar energy to turn seawater into freshwater.

07:56.060 --> 08:01.520
Prior to this innovation, the semi-arid land on which the farm sits was only able to support

08:01.520 --> 08:03.240
three cows.

08:03.240 --> 08:09.600
Now it has an abundance of water taken from the sea and produces 14% of Australia's

08:09.600 --> 08:10.600
tomatoes.

08:10.600 --> 08:15.640
And for people who have no idea what those are, they're tomatoes.

08:15.640 --> 08:19.520
Government officials in South Australia also have their eye on attracting international

08:19.520 --> 08:25.440
firms that need cheap renewable energy as a power source, because increasingly countries

08:25.440 --> 08:30.240
that are signed up to treaties limiting carbon emissions will penalise companies that have

08:30.240 --> 08:32.460
a high carbon footprint.

08:32.460 --> 08:36.340
Whether you agree with that or not, that's the reality.

08:36.340 --> 08:40.620
And this is how we now get to the current position of South Australia having the second

08:40.620 --> 08:47.180
highest uptake of variable renewable energy in the world, if it was an independent country.

08:47.180 --> 08:53.220
The state government not only met its renewable energy targets, it exceeded them.

08:53.220 --> 08:59.340
But for some pundits speaking in the year 2020, it's still 1995.

08:59.340 --> 09:06.100
Renewables are nice if they work, but they're expensive, unreliable, impractical and frankly

09:06.100 --> 09:07.100
a bit of a con.

09:07.100 --> 09:12.300
I guess that after pushing the same message for 20 years, based on technology that's

09:12.300 --> 09:16.460
30 years old, it's hard to change direction.

09:16.460 --> 09:21.820
The success of renewable energy in South Australia is reflected in plans to build a huge renewable

09:21.820 --> 09:29.500
energy hub that will produce 1.2 GW of wind and 600 MW of solar, packed up by a battery

09:29.500 --> 09:36.260
with 1.8 GW of storage, ten times bigger than the original Hornsdale battery.

09:36.260 --> 09:40.920
So South Australia could soon be producing far more electricity than it needs, nearly

09:40.920 --> 09:46.020
all from wind and solar, and much cheaper than neighbouring states.

09:46.020 --> 09:49.500
What will it do with all that cheap, clean energy?

09:49.500 --> 09:54.600
One answer, which is now being trialled with a pilot plant, is to split water molecules

09:54.600 --> 09:59.940
and produce hydrogen, and then export it to countries like Japan and South Korea that

09:59.940 --> 10:06.660
are also switching away from coal and oil, and looking ahead to a hydrogen-fuelled economy.

10:06.660 --> 10:10.060
Liquid sunshine, as one Australian engineer described it.

10:10.060 --> 10:15.060
I spoke about this in my video A Conservative Solution to Climate Change.

10:15.100 --> 10:19.980
This video is really a practical example of what I was saying in that video, which of

10:19.980 --> 10:24.700
course was all my opinion, a vision of the future that's not calling for world government

10:24.700 --> 10:30.740
and state control, but a free enterprise solution that should be easily adopted by both sides

10:30.740 --> 10:32.820
of the political equation.

10:32.820 --> 10:37.060
Now we can see what happens when we put that into practice.

10:37.060 --> 10:41.740
A measure of the success in South Australia is that other states like Victoria and New

10:41.740 --> 10:46.940
South Wales are now trying to emulate it, building similar renewable energy farms backed

10:46.940 --> 10:48.900
by battery storage.

10:48.900 --> 10:51.900
And again, this goes across party lines.

10:51.900 --> 10:57.100
New South Wales has a Conservative government, Victoria is left wing.

10:57.100 --> 11:02.780
In another video, my previous one, I asked the question, do you get it now, and clearly

11:02.780 --> 11:07.900
most of the states do, but there's also some encouraging news in the media.

11:07.900 --> 11:12.940
News International, which dominates Australia's media and is owned by Rupert Murdoch, who

11:12.940 --> 11:18.740
also owns Fox News, the Wall Street Journal and the New York Post, has spent decades downplaying

11:18.740 --> 11:24.540
or even denying the link between carbon dioxide and global temperature, and of course, rubbishing

11:24.540 --> 11:26.940
renewable energy.

11:26.940 --> 11:32.140
But almost overnight, it's announced a major editorial shift.

11:32.140 --> 11:36.780
Apparently they do now accept the science, at least here in Australia.

11:36.780 --> 11:41.380
They finally figured out that carbon dioxide does cause global warming and that something

11:41.380 --> 11:46.820
needs to be done about it, and that renewable energy is now a good thing.

11:46.820 --> 11:50.940
After scientists had been warning about this for decades, Murdoch and his editors suddenly

11:50.940 --> 11:52.980
decided they were right.

11:52.980 --> 11:57.880
But during those decades, News International has been spoon-feeding millions of readers

11:57.880 --> 12:04.660
and viewers a steady diet of slanted scientific nonsense that I've been debunking on my channel,

12:04.660 --> 12:09.860
splashing opinions from scientists with no qualifications in climate science and pundits

12:09.860 --> 12:16.060
who never passed high school science and even an op-ed piece written by a special correspondent

12:16.060 --> 12:20.980
who turned out to be an anonymous flak working for a resources industry lobby group.

12:20.980 --> 12:27.100
Well, I suppose it took the Roman Catholic Church over 350 years to finally admit that

12:27.100 --> 12:32.640
Galileo was right, the Earth does orbit the Sun, and it took creationists half a century

12:32.640 --> 12:38.380
to admit that animals do change over time, to the point where they can no longer interbreed.

12:38.380 --> 12:44.640
So it does take a while for entrenched ideological and religious beliefs to finally succumb to

12:44.640 --> 12:45.640
science.

12:45.640 --> 12:50.760
But isn't it nice to see what can be done when everyone does listen to the science and

12:50.760 --> 12:53.120
the ideological bickering stops?

13:02.640 --> 13:03.640
Thank you.

13:03.640 --> 13:03.640
