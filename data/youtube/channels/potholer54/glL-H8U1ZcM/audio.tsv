0	2640	Has another year really passed so quickly?
2640	6760	Yes, it's time to vote for the winner of this year's coveted Golden Crocoduck.
6760	9800	Last year, of course, I had to suspend the Golden Crocoduck.
9800	12040	I'll have more to say about that later.
12040	14640	First, to this year's nominees.
14640	17840	You've seen them highlighted in my videos throughout the year,
17840	20040	and here they all are together.
20040	25040	OK, biologically speaking, is that normal to do some of the things that are done?
25040	25720	No.
25720	32320	Crazy, I'm crazy for feeling so weak.
32320	35800	According to evolutionists and Darwinians,
35800	40200	that gene would be considered a weak gene in survival of the fittest.
40200	43000	So you know how long it would take for the homosexuals
43000	46440	to be wiped off the face of the Earth forever to be extinct?
46440	47720	One generation.
47720	51320	You go back about 1.3 billion years, now you've
51320	56160	got a serious problem, because the moon is skimming the surface of the Earth.
56160	60920	In the very first verse of Bible, we find a remarkable piece of evidence
60920	64560	of supernatural authorship.
64560	72680	I'm crazy for trying and crazy for crying.
72680	75960	This, let's say the sun is orbiting around the Earth,
75960	79360	then it's going to, over time, it's going to get out of balance,
79360	81080	and it's going to switch places.
81080	83800	The sun will wind up in the middle.
83800	86160	What?
86160	92280	The orbital Earth vehicle, which it is not, it is not moving.
92280	98240	I'm crazy for trying and crazy for crying.
98240	100720	In an interview with Ben Stein for the movie Expelled,
100720	103680	he stated quite clearly that no one knows how life started,
103680	106240	and that there's a real possibility that life on this planet
106240	109120	may have been seeded or influenced by higher forms of life.
111080	120440	Ah, what a wonderful collection of video clips.
120440	125960	I've had to disqualify Gorilla 199 because of a possible medical condition.
125960	129680	I know, often hard to tell with people who speak to invisible beings,
129680	133680	but in this case, I had good reason to believe the condition is genuine.
133680	138080	BT 3701's nomination also caused quite a bit of controversy.
138080	141280	Although this was clearly a disingenuous piece of nonsense,
141280	146360	he did label it as satire after I told him he'd been nominated for a Golden Crocoduck.
146360	150560	So I'll accept that as the equivalent of admitting an error and coming clean,
150560	153280	and take him off the final voting list.
153280	156400	I was hoping to have Harun Yahya in this year's line-up.
156400	160040	His Atlas of Creation was nominated for a Golden Crocoduck,
160040	163760	but unfortunately my video on him isn't ready in time,
163760	166520	so rather than hurry it and do a half-baked job,
166520	169720	I've decided to hold it over until next year.
169720	174760	Likewise, a few other contenders whose nominations arrived too late for this year.
174760	177120	Voting will take place on this website,
177120	180240	the URL of which is noted in the video description.
180240	184120	Feel free to campaign on behalf of your favourite candidates in this forum
184120	187000	and discuss the merits of the various nominees.
187000	189400	Voting closes on the 14th of October,
189400	192680	allowing me two weeks to prepare an awards video.
192680	196560	The winner, as always, will be announced on October 28th.
196560	201800	That's the feast day of St Jude Thaddeus, the patron saint of lost causes.
201800	205000	Now a word about the suspension of the competition last year,
205000	208840	because a lot of people seem very unclear about the rules.
208840	212520	The Golden Crocoduck is awarded for the biggest breach of the 9th commandment
212520	214840	in pursuit of the creationist cause.
214840	217840	If someone admits he or she was simply ignorant,
217840	220640	then that's not a breach of the 9th commandment,
220640	223120	so the nomination is ineligible.
223120	227680	That happened with Stone Commander, and last year it happened with Aminakin.
227680	230800	It's not given for the false filing of DMCAs
230800	235600	or being the stupidest or the meanest or the suckiest creationist of the month.
235600	240600	Because, fun as it is, there is of course a serious side to the Golden Crocoduck.
240600	246600	It's designed to show that the only way creationists can argue their case scientifically is to lie,
246600	250320	and the competition draws attention to this deception.
250320	254360	And while we're on the subject, a lot of people seem confused about what's acceptable
254360	257080	and what's not on my comments fora.
257080	261680	I said I had to remove several racist comments that came out of the Aminakin controversy,
261680	265120	and a lot of people seem to think I can't tell the difference between a comment
265120	269280	that's critical of religion and one that's plainly racist.
269280	272200	Just to clarify, I hardly ever remove comments,
272200	277120	and when I do, I always post a message explaining why I've removed one.
277120	278680	And these get removed so rarely.
278680	283000	I think I operate one of the freest and most open channels on YouTube.
283000	286600	Clearly comments that are critical of religion aren't removed
286600	289360	because you'll find them posted all over my channel,
289360	292560	and that includes comments that are critical of Islam.
292560	296480	You can refer to Muslims as idiots, gullible, deluded, whatever.
296480	298320	That's not racist.
298320	302560	Calling them Untermenschen, well, that's getting close to the line.
302560	305440	This was a Nazi term that meant subhuman.
305440	309480	But calling them sand n****s is stepping over the line.
309480	314800	And although I don't like it, I also tolerate personal abuse in the interests of free speech.
314800	319360	I wouldn't use language like that myself because it's not an intelligent argument,
319360	321720	but it is someone's opinion.
321720	326760	But posting a message that says I'd like to c*** on her face is not intelligent,
326760	330280	it's not an argument, and it's not even much of an opinion,
330280	333840	just a pornographic fantasy by some sad individual.
333840	336040	So that's one I deleted.
336040	337760	So this isn't a new policy,
337760	341320	and if you think these racist and pornographic comments are acceptable,
341320	343520	then I think you're on the wrong channel.
343520	347320	Several years ago, I posted a video called One Atheist's Creed
347320	349440	in which I outlined my beliefs
349440	353160	to counter the assertion that atheists have no beliefs.
353160	356080	And I think it's fitting to repost that now.
356080	359920	For those who are still subscribing and endorse these beliefs,
359920	360920	thank you.
363840	375040	I believe in being honest and compassionate towards others,
375040	378640	not because I'm told to or afraid of being punished if I don't,
378640	381200	but because I believe it's the right thing to do.
381200	385280	I believe it's wrong to discriminate against people based on race,
385280	388280	gender, religion, or sexual orientation.
388280	392920	I believe everyone has a right to freedom of speech and freedom of thought.
393440	397720	I believe adults have a responsibility to treat their children fairly
397720	399960	and to teach them a sense of right and wrong.
422920	429400	I will not believe in doctrines based on blind faith.
429400	433880	I will strive to keep an open mind and make deductions based on evidence.
433880	437560	I will not be dogmatic or unwilling to change my mind
437560	440280	if new evidence contradicts my understanding.
440280	444880	I will not fill gaps in knowledge with guesswork or blind belief.
444880	448120	I will not be afraid to say, I don't know.
452920	478200	I will oppose laws and policies based on religious dogma,
478200	481600	especially where they infringe on our rights and freedoms.
481600	484720	I will stand up against bigotry and injustice.
484720	486600	I will fight intolerance.
486600	490560	I will strive to bring the world together through our common humanity
490560	493160	and to end division over religious differences.
511600	522600	.
