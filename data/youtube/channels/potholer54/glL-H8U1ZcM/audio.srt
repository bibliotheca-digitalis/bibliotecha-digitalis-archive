1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,640
Has another year really passed so quickly?

2
00:00:02,640 --> 00:00:06,760
Yes, it's time to vote for the winner of this year's coveted Golden Crocoduck.

3
00:00:06,760 --> 00:00:09,800
Last year, of course, I had to suspend the Golden Crocoduck.

4
00:00:09,800 --> 00:00:12,040
I'll have more to say about that later.

5
00:00:12,040 --> 00:00:14,640
First, to this year's nominees.

6
00:00:14,640 --> 00:00:17,840
You've seen them highlighted in my videos throughout the year,

7
00:00:17,840 --> 00:00:20,040
and here they all are together.

8
00:00:20,040 --> 00:00:25,040
OK, biologically speaking, is that normal to do some of the things that are done?

9
00:00:25,040 --> 00:00:25,720
No.

10
00:00:25,720 --> 00:00:32,320
Crazy, I'm crazy for feeling so weak.

11
00:00:32,320 --> 00:00:35,800
According to evolutionists and Darwinians,

12
00:00:35,800 --> 00:00:40,200
that gene would be considered a weak gene in survival of the fittest.

13
00:00:40,200 --> 00:00:43,000
So you know how long it would take for the homosexuals

14
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:46,440
to be wiped off the face of the Earth forever to be extinct?

15
00:00:46,440 --> 00:00:47,720
One generation.

16
00:00:47,720 --> 00:00:51,320
You go back about 1.3 billion years, now you've

17
00:00:51,320 --> 00:00:56,160
got a serious problem, because the moon is skimming the surface of the Earth.

18
00:00:56,160 --> 00:01:00,920
In the very first verse of Bible, we find a remarkable piece of evidence

19
00:01:00,920 --> 00:01:04,560
of supernatural authorship.

20
00:01:04,560 --> 00:01:12,680
I'm crazy for trying and crazy for crying.

21
00:01:12,680 --> 00:01:15,960
This, let's say the sun is orbiting around the Earth,

22
00:01:15,960 --> 00:01:19,360
then it's going to, over time, it's going to get out of balance,

23
00:01:19,360 --> 00:01:21,080
and it's going to switch places.

24
00:01:21,080 --> 00:01:23,800
The sun will wind up in the middle.

25
00:01:23,800 --> 00:01:26,160
What?

26
00:01:26,160 --> 00:01:32,280
The orbital Earth vehicle, which it is not, it is not moving.

27
00:01:32,280 --> 00:01:38,240
I'm crazy for trying and crazy for crying.

28
00:01:38,240 --> 00:01:40,720
In an interview with Ben Stein for the movie Expelled,

29
00:01:40,720 --> 00:01:43,680
he stated quite clearly that no one knows how life started,

30
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:46,240
and that there's a real possibility that life on this planet

31
00:01:46,240 --> 00:01:49,120
may have been seeded or influenced by higher forms of life.

32
00:01:51,080 --> 00:02:00,440
Ah, what a wonderful collection of video clips.

33
00:02:00,440 --> 00:02:05,960
I've had to disqualify Gorilla 199 because of a possible medical condition.

34
00:02:05,960 --> 00:02:09,680
I know, often hard to tell with people who speak to invisible beings,

35
00:02:09,680 --> 00:02:13,680
but in this case, I had good reason to believe the condition is genuine.

36
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:18,080
BT 3701's nomination also caused quite a bit of controversy.

37
00:02:18,080 --> 00:02:21,280
Although this was clearly a disingenuous piece of nonsense,

38
00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:26,360
he did label it as satire after I told him he'd been nominated for a Golden Crocoduck.

39
00:02:26,360 --> 00:02:30,560
So I'll accept that as the equivalent of admitting an error and coming clean,

40
00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:33,280
and take him off the final voting list.

41
00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:36,400
I was hoping to have Harun Yahya in this year's line-up.

42
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:40,040
His Atlas of Creation was nominated for a Golden Crocoduck,

43
00:02:40,040 --> 00:02:43,760
but unfortunately my video on him isn't ready in time,

44
00:02:43,760 --> 00:02:46,520
so rather than hurry it and do a half-baked job,

45
00:02:46,520 --> 00:02:49,720
I've decided to hold it over until next year.

46
00:02:49,720 --> 00:02:54,760
Likewise, a few other contenders whose nominations arrived too late for this year.

47
00:02:54,760 --> 00:02:57,120
Voting will take place on this website,

48
00:02:57,120 --> 00:03:00,240
the URL of which is noted in the video description.

49
00:03:00,240 --> 00:03:04,120
Feel free to campaign on behalf of your favourite candidates in this forum

50
00:03:04,120 --> 00:03:07,000
and discuss the merits of the various nominees.

51
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:09,400
Voting closes on the 14th of October,

52
00:03:09,400 --> 00:03:12,680
allowing me two weeks to prepare an awards video.

53
00:03:12,680 --> 00:03:16,560
The winner, as always, will be announced on October 28th.

54
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:21,800
That's the feast day of St Jude Thaddeus, the patron saint of lost causes.

55
00:03:21,800 --> 00:03:25,000
Now a word about the suspension of the competition last year,

56
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:28,840
because a lot of people seem very unclear about the rules.

57
00:03:28,840 --> 00:03:32,520
The Golden Crocoduck is awarded for the biggest breach of the 9th commandment

58
00:03:32,520 --> 00:03:34,840
in pursuit of the creationist cause.

59
00:03:34,840 --> 00:03:37,840
If someone admits he or she was simply ignorant,

60
00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:40,640
then that's not a breach of the 9th commandment,

61
00:03:40,640 --> 00:03:43,120
so the nomination is ineligible.

62
00:03:43,120 --> 00:03:47,680
That happened with Stone Commander, and last year it happened with Aminakin.

63
00:03:47,680 --> 00:03:50,800
It's not given for the false filing of DMCAs

64
00:03:50,800 --> 00:03:55,600
or being the stupidest or the meanest or the suckiest creationist of the month.

65
00:03:55,600 --> 00:04:00,600
Because, fun as it is, there is of course a serious side to the Golden Crocoduck.

66
00:04:00,600 --> 00:04:06,600
It's designed to show that the only way creationists can argue their case scientifically is to lie,

67
00:04:06,600 --> 00:04:10,320
and the competition draws attention to this deception.

68
00:04:10,320 --> 00:04:14,360
And while we're on the subject, a lot of people seem confused about what's acceptable

69
00:04:14,360 --> 00:04:17,080
and what's not on my comments fora.

70
00:04:17,080 --> 00:04:21,680
I said I had to remove several racist comments that came out of the Aminakin controversy,

71
00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:25,120
and a lot of people seem to think I can't tell the difference between a comment

72
00:04:25,120 --> 00:04:29,280
that's critical of religion and one that's plainly racist.

73
00:04:29,280 --> 00:04:32,200
Just to clarify, I hardly ever remove comments,

74
00:04:32,200 --> 00:04:37,120
and when I do, I always post a message explaining why I've removed one.

75
00:04:37,120 --> 00:04:38,680
And these get removed so rarely.

76
00:04:38,680 --> 00:04:43,000
I think I operate one of the freest and most open channels on YouTube.

77
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:46,600
Clearly comments that are critical of religion aren't removed

78
00:04:46,600 --> 00:04:49,360
because you'll find them posted all over my channel,

79
00:04:49,360 --> 00:04:52,560
and that includes comments that are critical of Islam.

80
00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:56,480
You can refer to Muslims as idiots, gullible, deluded, whatever.

81
00:04:56,480 --> 00:04:58,320
That's not racist.

82
00:04:58,320 --> 00:05:02,560
Calling them Untermenschen, well, that's getting close to the line.

83
00:05:02,560 --> 00:05:05,440
This was a Nazi term that meant subhuman.

84
00:05:05,440 --> 00:05:09,480
But calling them sand n****s is stepping over the line.

85
00:05:09,480 --> 00:05:14,800
And although I don't like it, I also tolerate personal abuse in the interests of free speech.

86
00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:19,360
I wouldn't use language like that myself because it's not an intelligent argument,

87
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:21,720
but it is someone's opinion.

88
00:05:21,720 --> 00:05:26,760
But posting a message that says I'd like to c*** on her face is not intelligent,

89
00:05:26,760 --> 00:05:30,280
it's not an argument, and it's not even much of an opinion,

90
00:05:30,280 --> 00:05:33,840
just a pornographic fantasy by some sad individual.

91
00:05:33,840 --> 00:05:36,040
So that's one I deleted.

92
00:05:36,040 --> 00:05:37,760
So this isn't a new policy,

93
00:05:37,760 --> 00:05:41,320
and if you think these racist and pornographic comments are acceptable,

94
00:05:41,320 --> 00:05:43,520
then I think you're on the wrong channel.

95
00:05:43,520 --> 00:05:47,320
Several years ago, I posted a video called One Atheist's Creed

96
00:05:47,320 --> 00:05:49,440
in which I outlined my beliefs

97
00:05:49,440 --> 00:05:53,160
to counter the assertion that atheists have no beliefs.

98
00:05:53,160 --> 00:05:56,080
And I think it's fitting to repost that now.

99
00:05:56,080 --> 00:05:59,920
For those who are still subscribing and endorse these beliefs,

100
00:05:59,920 --> 00:06:00,920
thank you.

101
00:06:03,840 --> 00:06:15,040
I believe in being honest and compassionate towards others,

102
00:06:15,040 --> 00:06:18,640
not because I'm told to or afraid of being punished if I don't,

103
00:06:18,640 --> 00:06:21,200
but because I believe it's the right thing to do.

104
00:06:21,200 --> 00:06:25,280
I believe it's wrong to discriminate against people based on race,

105
00:06:25,280 --> 00:06:28,280
gender, religion, or sexual orientation.

106
00:06:28,280 --> 00:06:32,920
I believe everyone has a right to freedom of speech and freedom of thought.

107
00:06:33,440 --> 00:06:37,720
I believe adults have a responsibility to treat their children fairly

108
00:06:37,720 --> 00:06:39,960
and to teach them a sense of right and wrong.

109
00:07:02,920 --> 00:07:09,400
I will not believe in doctrines based on blind faith.

110
00:07:09,400 --> 00:07:13,880
I will strive to keep an open mind and make deductions based on evidence.

111
00:07:13,880 --> 00:07:17,560
I will not be dogmatic or unwilling to change my mind

112
00:07:17,560 --> 00:07:20,280
if new evidence contradicts my understanding.

113
00:07:20,280 --> 00:07:24,880
I will not fill gaps in knowledge with guesswork or blind belief.

114
00:07:24,880 --> 00:07:28,120
I will not be afraid to say, I don't know.

115
00:07:32,920 --> 00:07:58,200
I will oppose laws and policies based on religious dogma,

116
00:07:58,200 --> 00:08:01,600
especially where they infringe on our rights and freedoms.

117
00:08:01,600 --> 00:08:04,720
I will stand up against bigotry and injustice.

118
00:08:04,720 --> 00:08:06,600
I will fight intolerance.

119
00:08:06,600 --> 00:08:10,560
I will strive to bring the world together through our common humanity

120
00:08:10,560 --> 00:08:13,160
and to end division over religious differences.

121
00:08:31,600 --> 00:08:42,600
.
