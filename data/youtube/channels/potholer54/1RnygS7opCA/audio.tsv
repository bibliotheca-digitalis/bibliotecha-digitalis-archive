0	5000	Number one, cosmic evolution. This is the origin of time, space and matter.
5000	11000	Meet Golden Crocoduck nominee Chris Johnson. He's going to talk about evolution being a religion.
11000	15000	But first he's going to give us six different definitions of evolution.
15000	22000	Second definition of evolution would be stellar evolution. The third definition would be chemical evolution.
22000	29000	The fourth definition would be concerning the origin of life. The fifth one would be macro evolution.
29000	33000	This is one kind of animal changing into a completely different kind of animal.
33000	37000	Hang on, these definitions have a familiar ring. Why, here they are.
37000	43000	From a presentation given years ago by someone who is not Chris Johnson, so who came up with them.
43000	48000	Maybe you're talking about macro evolution. That's where an animal changes into a different kind of animal.
48000	52000	That's right. None other than the lagermeister himself, Kent Hovind.
52000	57000	But sorry Chris, I interrupted. You were saying something about macro evolution.
57000	61000	Again, dogs produce dogs. You might get a big dog or a little dog.
61000	65000	It might have straight hair, it might have curly hair, but it's a dog every time.
65000	68000	Nobody's ever seen a dog produce a non-dog.
68000	74000	I mean, you may get a big dog or a little dog, I understand, but you're going to get a dog, ok? Every time.
74000	78000	Now the dog and the wolf and the coyote may have had a common ancestor.
78000	81000	Could be. The dog, the wolf and the coyote had a common ancestor.
81000	88000	And so on and so on. It's almost as if Hovind escaped from jail, got a bad haircut and went right back to preaching.
88000	93000	Unfortunately, Johnson has none of the charisma of the real Hovind.
93000	101000	At least the real Hovind had the imagination to make up his own lies and deliver them with the geniality and confidence of an aluminum siding salesman.
101000	105000	Johnson is just boring, repetitive and predictable.
105000	112000	All the observable science, scientific evidence has shown us that dogs produce dogs, which is exactly what the Bible says.
112000	114000	They bring forth after their kind.
114000	118000	No argument there, so let's move on to something that supports the title of your video.
118000	125000	Now if you want to believe something non-dog produced a dog, then you're going outside the realm of science.
125000	128000	Look, no one believes something non-dog produces a dog.
128000	133000	Didn't you ever study evolution before embarking on this Hovind cut and paste rant?
133000	140000	In fact, the theory of evolution is only viable if an animal of one species gives birth to an animal of the same species.
140000	144000	If dogs started giving birth to rats, the whole theory would collapse.
144000	147000	Again, dogs produce dogs every time.
147000	148000	We know!
148000	151000	If we go by the observable evidence, we see they bring forth after their kind just like the Bible says.
151000	154000	To go beyond that and say that a dog came from something non-dog goes beyond the observation.
154000	156000	The science shows that dogs produce dogs, that's what we've always seen.
156000	157000	Shut up!
157000	160000	There are experimentations and no experimentations that have ever shown us that a dog can produce a non-dog.
160000	162000	If you want to believe that something non-dog produced a dog, why not?
162000	166000	Say dog again! I dare you! I double dare you!
167000	169000	Dogs produce dogs, that's what we've always seen.
173000	174000	You want drugs?
174000	181000	Johnson may be confused because of something that is observable and forms a key part of the theory of evolution.
181000	187000	When a dog gives birth to another dog, the offspring is not an exact copy of either parent.
187000	189000	It's different in very subtle ways.
189000	192000	It could be hairier, it could be frightened of the colour red.
192000	195000	It could be more aggressive towards camels.
195000	197000	But it's still a dog.
197000	199000	The same goes for a salamander.
199000	203000	This Encirtina doesn't give birth to a rat or an albatross.
203000	208000	It gives birth to another Encirtina with, of course, slight genetic differences.
208000	212000	Over successive generations, these differences accumulate.
212000	219000	If some Encirtina move into new territory, their descendants are eventually going to look very different to the distant cousins they left behind.
219000	223000	But as the two Hovins would say, it's still an Encirtina.
223000	228000	If you like, it's the same kind because both species can interbreed successfully.
228000	236000	And that's exactly what happened to the Encirtina salamander, which biologists think originated in and around the state of Oregon.
236000	243000	As the species expanded southwards to the west of California's Central Valley, it progressively changed.
243000	248000	But despite the differences, each type of Encirtina could still interbreed with its neighbours.
248000	252000	The Hovins would call this a classic example of microevolution.
252000	255000	Animals change, but they're still the same kind.
255000	256000	They can still interbreed.
256000	259000	See, if they can bring forth, they're the same kind.
259000	261000	Simple definition, can they bring forth?
261000	266000	The same thing happened with the Encirtina that spread southwards to the east of the Central Valley.
266000	269000	As they adapted to their new environments, they changed.
269000	275000	But each type of Encirtina could still interbreed with other Encirtina from neighbouring groups.
275000	279000	Then the two lines came together at the southern end of the Central Valley.
279000	282000	And that's where the creationist theory comes unstuck.
282000	290000	Because by now, each line has evolved so much and become so different to the ancestral Encirtina left behind in Oregon,
290000	292000	that the new neighbours can't interbreed.
292000	297000	So according to the biblical definition, they must be different kinds.
297000	304000	Let's just see what a mess this makes of Johnson's logic as we follow the evolutionary trail of these salamanders southwards.
304000	307000	Same kind, same kind, same kind.
307000	308000	Whoops!
308000	312000	If they're all the same kind, why can't these two interbreed?
312000	314000	That would make them a different kind.
314000	319000	But we know this one can interbreed with this one, so they must be the same kind.
320000	322000	Let's follow the trail back again.
322000	326000	Same kind, same kind, same kind, same kind, same kind.
326000	327000	Oh!
327000	328000	We've hit the same problem.
328000	333000	These ones at the end can't be the same kind, because they can't interbreed.
333000	334000	So back we go.
334000	337000	Same kind, same kind, same kind.
337000	343000	If this has creationists going round in frustrating circles, it's because this phenomenon is called ring species.
343000	349000	Even if creationists believe these salamanders were magically spoken into existence by a deity out of nothing,
349000	355000	that still doesn't explain why each neighbouring group can interbreed and these neighbouring groups can't.
355000	357000	Are they the same kind or not?
357000	360000	And it's not restricted to salamanders in California.
360000	365000	A bird called the greenish warbler has evolved as it moves around the Tibetan plateau,
365000	369000	and the gradual morphological changes between the groups can be seen.
369000	374000	Again, each group can interbreed with the neighbouring groups, so they all must be the same kind.
374000	381000	But where the two evolutionary trails meet and overlap in Siberia, the greenish warblers here can't interbreed.
381000	384000	So how can they all be the same kind?
384000	386000	Confusing, huh?
386000	390000	Actually, it's only creationists who are confused by ring species,
390000	394000	which is why you won't find any explanation of them in Creation Wiki,
394000	397000	and no answer to them in Answers in Genesis.
397000	403000	Biologists aren't confused because the existence of ring species is perfectly compatible with evolution.
403000	407000	In fact, we'd expect to get ring species, according to the theory of evolution.
407000	414000	This is because, in the real world, evolution doesn't produce neat little boxes dividing organisms into kinds.
414000	419000	Evolution is a gradation, a slow change from one type of organism into another,
419000	423000	and that's why a dog can never give birth to a non-dog.
423000	428000	It would be like a man coming out of a lump of clay, or a woman coming out of a rib.
428000	434000	I'm sure Johnson would agree with me that these are just as impossible as a non-dog coming out of a dog.
434000	436000	Or maybe not.
436000	442000	Having gone on at length about the impossibility of a supernatural event like a dog producing a non-dog,
442000	448000	Johnson then turns around and professes his belief in the supernatural. Huh?
448000	455000	I can provide evidence of the Bible being true and logical evidence of a Creator,
455000	461000	but I cannot prove it scientifically because science only deals with the physical and material world.
461000	463000	It can't test supernatural things.
463000	465000	Well, allow me to retort!
465000	468000	Of course, science can test supernatural things.
468000	471000	When this supernatural phenomenon was tested by science,
471000	475000	it was found to be caused by the refraction of light in water droplets.
475000	479000	Johnson once thought there was a supernatural flood that covered the Earth.
479000	482000	That was also tested by science and found to be wrong.
482000	486000	And the supernatural belief that we all appeared out of nothing 6,000 years ago
486000	489000	has been tested and falsified many times over.
489000	493000	Johnson himself shows that he believes stars are supernatural
493000	496000	because there's no possible way they could have formed on their own.
496000	498000	How does he reach that conclusion?
498000	501000	Well, once again he copies a Hovind argument.
501000	506000	They say, well, gases form together to make a star.
506000	509000	The idea of that is unscientific and unlogical
509000	512000	because Boyle's gas law would prevent that from happening.
512000	516000	Boyle's gas law is if you have a bunch of dust out in space like that
516000	519000	and they would condense to form something,
519000	524000	the closer together they get, the more energy, or the heat is increased,
524000	527000	kinetic energy drives them back out again.
527000	529000	Boyle's gas law would prevent that from happening.
529000	532000	So they don't have any explanations on how a star could even form.
532000	535000	Now, of course, Johnson isn't eligible for the coveted golden crocoduck
535000	540000	by going on and on and on and on about how dogs produce dogs.
540000	544000	That's like proclaiming that an ice cream factory produces ice cream.
544000	547000	It's hardly a breach of the ninth commandment.
547000	551000	But there's so much nonsense in his videos, the choice is just too enormous.
551000	553000	So I've plumped for this one.
553000	558000	Johnson's assertion that stars can't possibly form because of Boyle's law.
558000	563000	Generally speaking, it's true to say that these gases should be driven apart,
563000	567000	but for reasons more complex than Boyle's law, which only applies to ideal gases.
567000	571000	So how can they possibly come together and stay together?
571000	576000	If, as Johnson states, these balls of gas shouldn't exist, and yet they do,
576000	581000	then some invisible force must be counteracting the force that's pulling them apart.
581000	584000	Johnson can't think of any force capable of doing this,
584000	589000	so he assumes that this must be the work of the supernatural, i.e. God.
589000	596000	The question is, has science discovered some force in the universe that attracts matter together?
596000	597000	Hmm.
597000	602000	OK, this is so easy for anyone watching this video that I won't waste your time by explaining it.
602000	606000	I'll just play the response I played when a similarly dumb assertion was made
606000	609000	about how God must have made all the planets round.
609000	611000	Sign us out, Chris.
611000	613000	OK, Boyle's gas law would prevent that from happening,
613000	616000	so they don't have any explanations on how a star could even form.
616000	619000	I just want to say one word to you.
619000	622000	Just one word.
622000	623000	Yes, sir.
623000	624000	Are you listening?
624000	625000	Yes, I am.
