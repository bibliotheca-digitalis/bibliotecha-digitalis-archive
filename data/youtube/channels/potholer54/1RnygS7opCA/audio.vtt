00:00.000 --> 00:05.000
Number one, cosmic evolution. This is the origin of time, space and matter.

00:05.000 --> 00:11.000
Meet Golden Crocoduck nominee Chris Johnson. He's going to talk about evolution being a religion.

00:11.000 --> 00:15.000
But first he's going to give us six different definitions of evolution.

00:15.000 --> 00:22.000
Second definition of evolution would be stellar evolution. The third definition would be chemical evolution.

00:22.000 --> 00:29.000
The fourth definition would be concerning the origin of life. The fifth one would be macro evolution.

00:29.000 --> 00:33.000
This is one kind of animal changing into a completely different kind of animal.

00:33.000 --> 00:37.000
Hang on, these definitions have a familiar ring. Why, here they are.

00:37.000 --> 00:43.000
From a presentation given years ago by someone who is not Chris Johnson, so who came up with them.

00:43.000 --> 00:48.000
Maybe you're talking about macro evolution. That's where an animal changes into a different kind of animal.

00:48.000 --> 00:52.000
That's right. None other than the lagermeister himself, Kent Hovind.

00:52.000 --> 00:57.000
But sorry Chris, I interrupted. You were saying something about macro evolution.

00:57.000 --> 01:01.000
Again, dogs produce dogs. You might get a big dog or a little dog.

01:01.000 --> 01:05.000
It might have straight hair, it might have curly hair, but it's a dog every time.

01:05.000 --> 01:08.000
Nobody's ever seen a dog produce a non-dog.

01:08.000 --> 01:14.000
I mean, you may get a big dog or a little dog, I understand, but you're going to get a dog, ok? Every time.

01:14.000 --> 01:18.000
Now the dog and the wolf and the coyote may have had a common ancestor.

01:18.000 --> 01:21.000
Could be. The dog, the wolf and the coyote had a common ancestor.

01:21.000 --> 01:28.000
And so on and so on. It's almost as if Hovind escaped from jail, got a bad haircut and went right back to preaching.

01:28.000 --> 01:33.000
Unfortunately, Johnson has none of the charisma of the real Hovind.

01:33.000 --> 01:41.000
At least the real Hovind had the imagination to make up his own lies and deliver them with the geniality and confidence of an aluminum siding salesman.

01:41.000 --> 01:45.000
Johnson is just boring, repetitive and predictable.

01:45.000 --> 01:52.000
All the observable science, scientific evidence has shown us that dogs produce dogs, which is exactly what the Bible says.

01:52.000 --> 01:54.000
They bring forth after their kind.

01:54.000 --> 01:58.000
No argument there, so let's move on to something that supports the title of your video.

01:58.000 --> 02:05.000
Now if you want to believe something non-dog produced a dog, then you're going outside the realm of science.

02:05.000 --> 02:08.000
Look, no one believes something non-dog produces a dog.

02:08.000 --> 02:13.000
Didn't you ever study evolution before embarking on this Hovind cut and paste rant?

02:13.000 --> 02:20.000
In fact, the theory of evolution is only viable if an animal of one species gives birth to an animal of the same species.

02:20.000 --> 02:24.000
If dogs started giving birth to rats, the whole theory would collapse.

02:24.000 --> 02:27.000
Again, dogs produce dogs every time.

02:27.000 --> 02:28.000
We know!

02:28.000 --> 02:31.000
If we go by the observable evidence, we see they bring forth after their kind just like the Bible says.

02:31.000 --> 02:34.000
To go beyond that and say that a dog came from something non-dog goes beyond the observation.

02:34.000 --> 02:36.000
The science shows that dogs produce dogs, that's what we've always seen.

02:36.000 --> 02:37.000
Shut up!

02:37.000 --> 02:40.000
There are experimentations and no experimentations that have ever shown us that a dog can produce a non-dog.

02:40.000 --> 02:42.000
If you want to believe that something non-dog produced a dog, why not?

02:42.000 --> 02:46.000
Say dog again! I dare you! I double dare you!

02:47.000 --> 02:49.000
Dogs produce dogs, that's what we've always seen.

02:53.000 --> 02:54.000
You want drugs?

02:54.000 --> 03:01.000
Johnson may be confused because of something that is observable and forms a key part of the theory of evolution.

03:01.000 --> 03:07.000
When a dog gives birth to another dog, the offspring is not an exact copy of either parent.

03:07.000 --> 03:09.000
It's different in very subtle ways.

03:09.000 --> 03:12.000
It could be hairier, it could be frightened of the colour red.

03:12.000 --> 03:15.000
It could be more aggressive towards camels.

03:15.000 --> 03:17.000
But it's still a dog.

03:17.000 --> 03:19.000
The same goes for a salamander.

03:19.000 --> 03:23.000
This Encirtina doesn't give birth to a rat or an albatross.

03:23.000 --> 03:28.000
It gives birth to another Encirtina with, of course, slight genetic differences.

03:28.000 --> 03:32.000
Over successive generations, these differences accumulate.

03:32.000 --> 03:39.000
If some Encirtina move into new territory, their descendants are eventually going to look very different to the distant cousins they left behind.

03:39.000 --> 03:43.000
But as the two Hovins would say, it's still an Encirtina.

03:43.000 --> 03:48.000
If you like, it's the same kind because both species can interbreed successfully.

03:48.000 --> 03:56.000
And that's exactly what happened to the Encirtina salamander, which biologists think originated in and around the state of Oregon.

03:56.000 --> 04:03.000
As the species expanded southwards to the west of California's Central Valley, it progressively changed.

04:03.000 --> 04:08.000
But despite the differences, each type of Encirtina could still interbreed with its neighbours.

04:08.000 --> 04:12.000
The Hovins would call this a classic example of microevolution.

04:12.000 --> 04:15.000
Animals change, but they're still the same kind.

04:15.000 --> 04:16.000
They can still interbreed.

04:16.000 --> 04:19.000
See, if they can bring forth, they're the same kind.

04:19.000 --> 04:21.000
Simple definition, can they bring forth?

04:21.000 --> 04:26.000
The same thing happened with the Encirtina that spread southwards to the east of the Central Valley.

04:26.000 --> 04:29.000
As they adapted to their new environments, they changed.

04:29.000 --> 04:35.000
But each type of Encirtina could still interbreed with other Encirtina from neighbouring groups.

04:35.000 --> 04:39.000
Then the two lines came together at the southern end of the Central Valley.

04:39.000 --> 04:42.000
And that's where the creationist theory comes unstuck.

04:42.000 --> 04:50.000
Because by now, each line has evolved so much and become so different to the ancestral Encirtina left behind in Oregon,

04:50.000 --> 04:52.000
that the new neighbours can't interbreed.

04:52.000 --> 04:57.000
So according to the biblical definition, they must be different kinds.

04:57.000 --> 05:04.000
Let's just see what a mess this makes of Johnson's logic as we follow the evolutionary trail of these salamanders southwards.

05:04.000 --> 05:07.000
Same kind, same kind, same kind.

05:07.000 --> 05:08.000
Whoops!

05:08.000 --> 05:12.000
If they're all the same kind, why can't these two interbreed?

05:12.000 --> 05:14.000
That would make them a different kind.

05:14.000 --> 05:19.000
But we know this one can interbreed with this one, so they must be the same kind.

05:20.000 --> 05:22.000
Let's follow the trail back again.

05:22.000 --> 05:26.000
Same kind, same kind, same kind, same kind, same kind.

05:26.000 --> 05:27.000
Oh!

05:27.000 --> 05:28.000
We've hit the same problem.

05:28.000 --> 05:33.000
These ones at the end can't be the same kind, because they can't interbreed.

05:33.000 --> 05:34.000
So back we go.

05:34.000 --> 05:37.000
Same kind, same kind, same kind.

05:37.000 --> 05:43.000
If this has creationists going round in frustrating circles, it's because this phenomenon is called ring species.

05:43.000 --> 05:49.000
Even if creationists believe these salamanders were magically spoken into existence by a deity out of nothing,

05:49.000 --> 05:55.000
that still doesn't explain why each neighbouring group can interbreed and these neighbouring groups can't.

05:55.000 --> 05:57.000
Are they the same kind or not?

05:57.000 --> 06:00.000
And it's not restricted to salamanders in California.

06:00.000 --> 06:05.000
A bird called the greenish warbler has evolved as it moves around the Tibetan plateau,

06:05.000 --> 06:09.000
and the gradual morphological changes between the groups can be seen.

06:09.000 --> 06:14.000
Again, each group can interbreed with the neighbouring groups, so they all must be the same kind.

06:14.000 --> 06:21.000
But where the two evolutionary trails meet and overlap in Siberia, the greenish warblers here can't interbreed.

06:21.000 --> 06:24.000
So how can they all be the same kind?

06:24.000 --> 06:26.000
Confusing, huh?

06:26.000 --> 06:30.000
Actually, it's only creationists who are confused by ring species,

06:30.000 --> 06:34.000
which is why you won't find any explanation of them in Creation Wiki,

06:34.000 --> 06:37.000
and no answer to them in Answers in Genesis.

06:37.000 --> 06:43.000
Biologists aren't confused because the existence of ring species is perfectly compatible with evolution.

06:43.000 --> 06:47.000
In fact, we'd expect to get ring species, according to the theory of evolution.

06:47.000 --> 06:54.000
This is because, in the real world, evolution doesn't produce neat little boxes dividing organisms into kinds.

06:54.000 --> 06:59.000
Evolution is a gradation, a slow change from one type of organism into another,

06:59.000 --> 07:03.000
and that's why a dog can never give birth to a non-dog.

07:03.000 --> 07:08.000
It would be like a man coming out of a lump of clay, or a woman coming out of a rib.

07:08.000 --> 07:14.000
I'm sure Johnson would agree with me that these are just as impossible as a non-dog coming out of a dog.

07:14.000 --> 07:16.000
Or maybe not.

07:16.000 --> 07:22.000
Having gone on at length about the impossibility of a supernatural event like a dog producing a non-dog,

07:22.000 --> 07:28.000
Johnson then turns around and professes his belief in the supernatural. Huh?

07:28.000 --> 07:35.000
I can provide evidence of the Bible being true and logical evidence of a Creator,

07:35.000 --> 07:41.000
but I cannot prove it scientifically because science only deals with the physical and material world.

07:41.000 --> 07:43.000
It can't test supernatural things.

07:43.000 --> 07:45.000
Well, allow me to retort!

07:45.000 --> 07:48.000
Of course, science can test supernatural things.

07:48.000 --> 07:51.000
When this supernatural phenomenon was tested by science,

07:51.000 --> 07:55.000
it was found to be caused by the refraction of light in water droplets.

07:55.000 --> 07:59.000
Johnson once thought there was a supernatural flood that covered the Earth.

07:59.000 --> 08:02.000
That was also tested by science and found to be wrong.

08:02.000 --> 08:06.000
And the supernatural belief that we all appeared out of nothing 6,000 years ago

08:06.000 --> 08:09.000
has been tested and falsified many times over.

08:09.000 --> 08:13.000
Johnson himself shows that he believes stars are supernatural

08:13.000 --> 08:16.000
because there's no possible way they could have formed on their own.

08:16.000 --> 08:18.000
How does he reach that conclusion?

08:18.000 --> 08:21.000
Well, once again he copies a Hovind argument.

08:21.000 --> 08:26.000
They say, well, gases form together to make a star.

08:26.000 --> 08:29.000
The idea of that is unscientific and unlogical

08:29.000 --> 08:32.000
because Boyle's gas law would prevent that from happening.

08:32.000 --> 08:36.000
Boyle's gas law is if you have a bunch of dust out in space like that

08:36.000 --> 08:39.000
and they would condense to form something,

08:39.000 --> 08:44.000
the closer together they get, the more energy, or the heat is increased,

08:44.000 --> 08:47.000
kinetic energy drives them back out again.

08:47.000 --> 08:49.000
Boyle's gas law would prevent that from happening.

08:49.000 --> 08:52.000
So they don't have any explanations on how a star could even form.

08:52.000 --> 08:55.000
Now, of course, Johnson isn't eligible for the coveted golden crocoduck

08:55.000 --> 09:00.000
by going on and on and on and on about how dogs produce dogs.

09:00.000 --> 09:04.000
That's like proclaiming that an ice cream factory produces ice cream.

09:04.000 --> 09:07.000
It's hardly a breach of the ninth commandment.

09:07.000 --> 09:11.000
But there's so much nonsense in his videos, the choice is just too enormous.

09:11.000 --> 09:13.000
So I've plumped for this one.

09:13.000 --> 09:18.000
Johnson's assertion that stars can't possibly form because of Boyle's law.

09:18.000 --> 09:23.000
Generally speaking, it's true to say that these gases should be driven apart,

09:23.000 --> 09:27.000
but for reasons more complex than Boyle's law, which only applies to ideal gases.

09:27.000 --> 09:31.000
So how can they possibly come together and stay together?

09:31.000 --> 09:36.000
If, as Johnson states, these balls of gas shouldn't exist, and yet they do,

09:36.000 --> 09:41.000
then some invisible force must be counteracting the force that's pulling them apart.

09:41.000 --> 09:44.000
Johnson can't think of any force capable of doing this,

09:44.000 --> 09:49.000
so he assumes that this must be the work of the supernatural, i.e. God.

09:49.000 --> 09:56.000
The question is, has science discovered some force in the universe that attracts matter together?

09:56.000 --> 09:57.000
Hmm.

09:57.000 --> 10:02.000
OK, this is so easy for anyone watching this video that I won't waste your time by explaining it.

10:02.000 --> 10:06.000
I'll just play the response I played when a similarly dumb assertion was made

10:06.000 --> 10:09.000
about how God must have made all the planets round.

10:09.000 --> 10:11.000
Sign us out, Chris.

10:11.000 --> 10:13.000
OK, Boyle's gas law would prevent that from happening,

10:13.000 --> 10:16.000
so they don't have any explanations on how a star could even form.

10:16.000 --> 10:19.000
I just want to say one word to you.

10:19.000 --> 10:22.000
Just one word.

10:22.000 --> 10:23.000
Yes, sir.

10:23.000 --> 10:24.000
Are you listening?

10:24.000 --> 10:25.000
Yes, I am.
