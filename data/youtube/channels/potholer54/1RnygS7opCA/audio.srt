1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
Number one, cosmic evolution. This is the origin of time, space and matter.

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:11,000
Meet Golden Crocoduck nominee Chris Johnson. He's going to talk about evolution being a religion.

3
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:15,000
But first he's going to give us six different definitions of evolution.

4
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:22,000
Second definition of evolution would be stellar evolution. The third definition would be chemical evolution.

5
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:29,000
The fourth definition would be concerning the origin of life. The fifth one would be macro evolution.

6
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:33,000
This is one kind of animal changing into a completely different kind of animal.

7
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:37,000
Hang on, these definitions have a familiar ring. Why, here they are.

8
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:43,000
From a presentation given years ago by someone who is not Chris Johnson, so who came up with them.

9
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:48,000
Maybe you're talking about macro evolution. That's where an animal changes into a different kind of animal.

10
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:52,000
That's right. None other than the lagermeister himself, Kent Hovind.

11
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:57,000
But sorry Chris, I interrupted. You were saying something about macro evolution.

12
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:01,000
Again, dogs produce dogs. You might get a big dog or a little dog.

13
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:05,000
It might have straight hair, it might have curly hair, but it's a dog every time.

14
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:08,000
Nobody's ever seen a dog produce a non-dog.

15
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:14,000
I mean, you may get a big dog or a little dog, I understand, but you're going to get a dog, ok? Every time.

16
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:18,000
Now the dog and the wolf and the coyote may have had a common ancestor.

17
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:21,000
Could be. The dog, the wolf and the coyote had a common ancestor.

18
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:28,000
And so on and so on. It's almost as if Hovind escaped from jail, got a bad haircut and went right back to preaching.

19
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:33,000
Unfortunately, Johnson has none of the charisma of the real Hovind.

20
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:41,000
At least the real Hovind had the imagination to make up his own lies and deliver them with the geniality and confidence of an aluminum siding salesman.

21
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:45,000
Johnson is just boring, repetitive and predictable.

22
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:52,000
All the observable science, scientific evidence has shown us that dogs produce dogs, which is exactly what the Bible says.

23
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,000
They bring forth after their kind.

24
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:58,000
No argument there, so let's move on to something that supports the title of your video.

25
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:05,000
Now if you want to believe something non-dog produced a dog, then you're going outside the realm of science.

26
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:08,000
Look, no one believes something non-dog produces a dog.

27
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:13,000
Didn't you ever study evolution before embarking on this Hovind cut and paste rant?

28
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:20,000
In fact, the theory of evolution is only viable if an animal of one species gives birth to an animal of the same species.

29
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:24,000
If dogs started giving birth to rats, the whole theory would collapse.

30
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:27,000
Again, dogs produce dogs every time.

31
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:28,000
We know!

32
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:31,000
If we go by the observable evidence, we see they bring forth after their kind just like the Bible says.

33
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:34,000
To go beyond that and say that a dog came from something non-dog goes beyond the observation.

34
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,000
The science shows that dogs produce dogs, that's what we've always seen.

35
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:37,000
Shut up!

36
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:40,000
There are experimentations and no experimentations that have ever shown us that a dog can produce a non-dog.

37
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,000
If you want to believe that something non-dog produced a dog, why not?

38
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:46,000
Say dog again! I dare you! I double dare you!

39
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:49,000
Dogs produce dogs, that's what we've always seen.

40
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:54,000
You want drugs?

41
00:02:54,000 --> 00:03:01,000
Johnson may be confused because of something that is observable and forms a key part of the theory of evolution.

42
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:07,000
When a dog gives birth to another dog, the offspring is not an exact copy of either parent.

43
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:09,000
It's different in very subtle ways.

44
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:12,000
It could be hairier, it could be frightened of the colour red.

45
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:15,000
It could be more aggressive towards camels.

46
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:17,000
But it's still a dog.

47
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:19,000
The same goes for a salamander.

48
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:23,000
This Encirtina doesn't give birth to a rat or an albatross.

49
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:28,000
It gives birth to another Encirtina with, of course, slight genetic differences.

50
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:32,000
Over successive generations, these differences accumulate.

51
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:39,000
If some Encirtina move into new territory, their descendants are eventually going to look very different to the distant cousins they left behind.

52
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:43,000
But as the two Hovins would say, it's still an Encirtina.

53
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:48,000
If you like, it's the same kind because both species can interbreed successfully.

54
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:56,000
And that's exactly what happened to the Encirtina salamander, which biologists think originated in and around the state of Oregon.

55
00:03:56,000 --> 00:04:03,000
As the species expanded southwards to the west of California's Central Valley, it progressively changed.

56
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:08,000
But despite the differences, each type of Encirtina could still interbreed with its neighbours.

57
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:12,000
The Hovins would call this a classic example of microevolution.

58
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:15,000
Animals change, but they're still the same kind.

59
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:16,000
They can still interbreed.

60
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:19,000
See, if they can bring forth, they're the same kind.

61
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:21,000
Simple definition, can they bring forth?

62
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:26,000
The same thing happened with the Encirtina that spread southwards to the east of the Central Valley.

63
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:29,000
As they adapted to their new environments, they changed.

64
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:35,000
But each type of Encirtina could still interbreed with other Encirtina from neighbouring groups.

65
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:39,000
Then the two lines came together at the southern end of the Central Valley.

66
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:42,000
And that's where the creationist theory comes unstuck.

67
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:50,000
Because by now, each line has evolved so much and become so different to the ancestral Encirtina left behind in Oregon,

68
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:52,000
that the new neighbours can't interbreed.

69
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:57,000
So according to the biblical definition, they must be different kinds.

70
00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:04,000
Let's just see what a mess this makes of Johnson's logic as we follow the evolutionary trail of these salamanders southwards.

71
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:07,000
Same kind, same kind, same kind.

72
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:08,000
Whoops!

73
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:12,000
If they're all the same kind, why can't these two interbreed?

74
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,000
That would make them a different kind.

75
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:19,000
But we know this one can interbreed with this one, so they must be the same kind.

76
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:22,000
Let's follow the trail back again.

77
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:26,000
Same kind, same kind, same kind, same kind, same kind.

78
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:27,000
Oh!

79
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:28,000
We've hit the same problem.

80
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:33,000
These ones at the end can't be the same kind, because they can't interbreed.

81
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:34,000
So back we go.

82
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:37,000
Same kind, same kind, same kind.

83
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:43,000
If this has creationists going round in frustrating circles, it's because this phenomenon is called ring species.

84
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:49,000
Even if creationists believe these salamanders were magically spoken into existence by a deity out of nothing,

85
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:55,000
that still doesn't explain why each neighbouring group can interbreed and these neighbouring groups can't.

86
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:57,000
Are they the same kind or not?

87
00:05:57,000 --> 00:06:00,000
And it's not restricted to salamanders in California.

88
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:05,000
A bird called the greenish warbler has evolved as it moves around the Tibetan plateau,

89
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:09,000
and the gradual morphological changes between the groups can be seen.

90
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:14,000
Again, each group can interbreed with the neighbouring groups, so they all must be the same kind.

91
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:21,000
But where the two evolutionary trails meet and overlap in Siberia, the greenish warblers here can't interbreed.

92
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:24,000
So how can they all be the same kind?

93
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:26,000
Confusing, huh?

94
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:30,000
Actually, it's only creationists who are confused by ring species,

95
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:34,000
which is why you won't find any explanation of them in Creation Wiki,

96
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:37,000
and no answer to them in Answers in Genesis.

97
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:43,000
Biologists aren't confused because the existence of ring species is perfectly compatible with evolution.

98
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:47,000
In fact, we'd expect to get ring species, according to the theory of evolution.

99
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:54,000
This is because, in the real world, evolution doesn't produce neat little boxes dividing organisms into kinds.

100
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:59,000
Evolution is a gradation, a slow change from one type of organism into another,

101
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:03,000
and that's why a dog can never give birth to a non-dog.

102
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:08,000
It would be like a man coming out of a lump of clay, or a woman coming out of a rib.

103
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:14,000
I'm sure Johnson would agree with me that these are just as impossible as a non-dog coming out of a dog.

104
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:16,000
Or maybe not.

105
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:22,000
Having gone on at length about the impossibility of a supernatural event like a dog producing a non-dog,

106
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:28,000
Johnson then turns around and professes his belief in the supernatural. Huh?

107
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:35,000
I can provide evidence of the Bible being true and logical evidence of a Creator,

108
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:41,000
but I cannot prove it scientifically because science only deals with the physical and material world.

109
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:43,000
It can't test supernatural things.

110
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:45,000
Well, allow me to retort!

111
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:48,000
Of course, science can test supernatural things.

112
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:51,000
When this supernatural phenomenon was tested by science,

113
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:55,000
it was found to be caused by the refraction of light in water droplets.

114
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:59,000
Johnson once thought there was a supernatural flood that covered the Earth.

115
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:02,000
That was also tested by science and found to be wrong.

116
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:06,000
And the supernatural belief that we all appeared out of nothing 6,000 years ago

117
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:09,000
has been tested and falsified many times over.

118
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:13,000
Johnson himself shows that he believes stars are supernatural

119
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:16,000
because there's no possible way they could have formed on their own.

120
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:18,000
How does he reach that conclusion?

121
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:21,000
Well, once again he copies a Hovind argument.

122
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:26,000
They say, well, gases form together to make a star.

123
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:29,000
The idea of that is unscientific and unlogical

124
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:32,000
because Boyle's gas law would prevent that from happening.

125
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:36,000
Boyle's gas law is if you have a bunch of dust out in space like that

126
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:39,000
and they would condense to form something,

127
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:44,000
the closer together they get, the more energy, or the heat is increased,

128
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:47,000
kinetic energy drives them back out again.

129
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:49,000
Boyle's gas law would prevent that from happening.

130
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:52,000
So they don't have any explanations on how a star could even form.

131
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:55,000
Now, of course, Johnson isn't eligible for the coveted golden crocoduck

132
00:08:55,000 --> 00:09:00,000
by going on and on and on and on about how dogs produce dogs.

133
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:04,000
That's like proclaiming that an ice cream factory produces ice cream.

134
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:07,000
It's hardly a breach of the ninth commandment.

135
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:11,000
But there's so much nonsense in his videos, the choice is just too enormous.

136
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:13,000
So I've plumped for this one.

137
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:18,000
Johnson's assertion that stars can't possibly form because of Boyle's law.

138
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:23,000
Generally speaking, it's true to say that these gases should be driven apart,

139
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:27,000
but for reasons more complex than Boyle's law, which only applies to ideal gases.

140
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:31,000
So how can they possibly come together and stay together?

141
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:36,000
If, as Johnson states, these balls of gas shouldn't exist, and yet they do,

142
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:41,000
then some invisible force must be counteracting the force that's pulling them apart.

143
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:44,000
Johnson can't think of any force capable of doing this,

144
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:49,000
so he assumes that this must be the work of the supernatural, i.e. God.

145
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:56,000
The question is, has science discovered some force in the universe that attracts matter together?

146
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:57,000
Hmm.

147
00:09:57,000 --> 00:10:02,000
OK, this is so easy for anyone watching this video that I won't waste your time by explaining it.

148
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:06,000
I'll just play the response I played when a similarly dumb assertion was made

149
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:09,000
about how God must have made all the planets round.

150
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:11,000
Sign us out, Chris.

151
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:13,000
OK, Boyle's gas law would prevent that from happening,

152
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:16,000
so they don't have any explanations on how a star could even form.

153
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:19,000
I just want to say one word to you.

154
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:22,000
Just one word.

155
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:23,000
Yes, sir.

156
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:24,000
Are you listening?

157
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:25,000
Yes, I am.
