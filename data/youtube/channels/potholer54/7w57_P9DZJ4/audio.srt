1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,120
I certainly don't believe that you came from ape-like creatures or anything like that.

2
00:00:05,120 --> 00:00:07,120
I mean, did your grandfather look like that?

3
00:00:07,120 --> 00:00:08,800
Did your grandfather look like that?

4
00:00:08,800 --> 00:00:10,480
Did your grandfather look like that?

5
00:00:10,480 --> 00:00:32,760
In the video Natural Selection Made Easy, I looked at heredity and showed a mechanism

6
00:00:32,760 --> 00:00:35,480
by which evolution could be predicted.

7
00:00:35,480 --> 00:00:40,440
There are so many observed examples of organisms changing that even fundamentalist preachers

8
00:00:40,440 --> 00:00:43,560
like Ken Ham can't pretend it doesn't happen.

9
00:00:43,560 --> 00:00:47,960
They've even embraced the idea in order to explain how Noah fitted all those animals

10
00:00:47,960 --> 00:00:49,800
onto the ark.

11
00:00:49,800 --> 00:00:54,920
But they don't accept that evolution can create new species or that evolution is responsible

12
00:00:54,920 --> 00:00:58,200
for the abundance of life we see all around us.

13
00:00:58,200 --> 00:01:02,000
So in this video I want to show some of the evidence that makes evolution an accepted

14
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:05,480
fact among biologists all over the world.

15
00:01:05,480 --> 00:01:10,280
Previous videos showed how the earth's sedimentary rocks are like the pages of a book, taking

16
00:01:10,280 --> 00:01:12,160
us back through time.

17
00:01:12,160 --> 00:01:16,800
Nineteenth century geologists discovered that the lowest and oldest layers contained a small

18
00:01:16,800 --> 00:01:19,920
variety of very primitive marine species.

19
00:01:19,920 --> 00:01:24,200
Higher sedimentary layers held more varied and more complex creatures.

20
00:01:24,200 --> 00:01:28,520
The progression suggested that these animals didn't appear suddenly but were gradually

21
00:01:28,520 --> 00:01:30,180
evolving.

22
00:01:30,180 --> 00:01:32,580
But there were sudden disappearances.

23
00:01:32,580 --> 00:01:39,100
This layer of rock, for example, marks a catastrophic mass extinction about 250 million years ago.

24
00:01:39,100 --> 00:01:43,700
The rocks below this line are full of marine fossils but in the rocks above they're all

25
00:01:43,700 --> 00:01:44,960
gone.

26
00:01:44,960 --> 00:01:50,180
There were five global mass extinctions we know of, each one wiping out between 50 and

27
00:01:50,180 --> 00:01:52,460
95% of species.

28
00:01:52,460 --> 00:01:57,740
Each was followed by the gradual recolonisation of the earth by surviving organisms that again

29
00:01:57,740 --> 00:02:02,920
began to change and become more complex until the next mass extinction.

30
00:02:02,920 --> 00:02:07,580
If this increasing complexity really did mean some kind of evolution, we'd expect to see

31
00:02:07,580 --> 00:02:12,860
it in individual species as we track their fossils through millions of years of sedimentary

32
00:02:12,860 --> 00:02:13,860
rock.

33
00:02:13,860 --> 00:02:14,860
And we do.

34
00:02:14,860 --> 00:02:19,120
Either each species is suddenly being killed off, only to be replaced by the sudden appearance

35
00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:23,740
of something that's almost identical, or we're seeing the changing morphology of a single

36
00:02:23,740 --> 00:02:25,780
species through time.

37
00:02:25,820 --> 00:02:31,020
We'd also expect to see traces of an animal's evolutionary ancestry in its morphology today,

38
00:02:31,020 --> 00:02:32,300
and we do.

39
00:02:32,300 --> 00:02:34,780
Take a look at this skeleton of an ape's hand.

40
00:02:34,780 --> 00:02:38,260
It looks just like a human hand, except it's not.

41
00:02:38,260 --> 00:02:40,860
In fact, it's not an ape's hand either.

42
00:02:40,860 --> 00:02:45,820
It's a whale's hand, or at least what used to be a hand in its ancestral past and is

43
00:02:45,820 --> 00:02:47,740
now used as a flipper.

44
00:02:47,740 --> 00:02:52,140
The morphology of animals today is full of remnant body parts that have been changed

45
00:02:52,140 --> 00:02:55,620
and adapted, just as evolution predicts.

46
00:02:55,660 --> 00:02:59,860
In the video on natural selection, I showed how a hypothetical animal might evolve into

47
00:02:59,860 --> 00:03:01,700
two different species.

48
00:03:01,700 --> 00:03:06,820
At first, the two types would be able to reproduce, then reproduce with difficulty, and then not

49
00:03:06,820 --> 00:03:08,640
reproduce at all.

50
00:03:08,640 --> 00:03:13,580
We can't watch it happening in mammals today because it takes several thousand generations,

51
00:03:13,580 --> 00:03:17,340
but we can see snapshots of it frozen in time.

52
00:03:17,340 --> 00:03:21,580
Modern horses, for example, separated from zebras several million years ago.

53
00:03:21,580 --> 00:03:27,500
They can still reproduce, but with difficulty, because a horse's DNA has 64 chromosomes

54
00:03:27,500 --> 00:03:29,540
and a zebra's 44.

55
00:03:29,540 --> 00:03:34,340
When an offspring is produced, it's sterile, exactly what evolution would predict.

56
00:03:34,340 --> 00:03:40,380
An even better example is found around mountains, where a species evolves as it spreads geographically.

57
00:03:40,380 --> 00:03:44,540
Each species can interbreed with the one next to it, but the species at each end of the

58
00:03:44,540 --> 00:03:47,660
line can't interbreed with each other.

59
00:03:47,660 --> 00:03:52,660
Among organisms with very fast reproduction rates, such as bacteria and flies, separation

60
00:03:52,660 --> 00:03:55,660
into new species has indeed been seen.

61
00:03:55,660 --> 00:03:59,760
This, for example, is a flavobacterium that eats nylon.

62
00:03:59,760 --> 00:04:04,380
It was found in a waste outlet near a Japanese factory that produces the stuff.

63
00:04:04,380 --> 00:04:10,140
The problem is, nylon was only invented in 1935 and is completely synthetic and undigestible

64
00:04:10,140 --> 00:04:12,300
to other bacteria.

65
00:04:12,300 --> 00:04:18,140
Was nylon-eating bacteria for some reason present in the nylon-free Garden of Eden and

66
00:04:18,140 --> 00:04:20,260
managed not to starve to death?

67
00:04:20,260 --> 00:04:25,700
Or did God endow some bacteria with the gift of nylon digestion in 1935?

68
00:04:25,700 --> 00:04:30,840
Or does this fit perfectly with evolution and they evolve because of a mutation sometime

69
00:04:30,840 --> 00:04:35,740
between the invention of nylon and their discovery 40 years later?

70
00:04:35,740 --> 00:04:40,780
The answer came when researchers kept a completely different bacterium in a similar nylon-rich

71
00:04:40,780 --> 00:04:44,140
environment and the same mutation occurred.

72
00:04:44,140 --> 00:04:49,960
DNA research has only added to the overwhelming evidence of evolution, but it has also completely

73
00:04:49,960 --> 00:04:54,980
shaken up the evolutionary tree and shown in much greater detail which animals share

74
00:04:54,980 --> 00:04:59,060
a common ancestor and when they separated.

75
00:04:59,060 --> 00:05:04,100
Researchers are now manipulating DNA to discover a treasure trove of evolutionary information.

76
00:05:04,100 --> 00:05:08,860
It's long been known that ancestral traits buried deep inside DNA can get switched on

77
00:05:08,860 --> 00:05:12,060
by accident with very obvious results.

78
00:05:12,060 --> 00:05:16,220
But they can also now be deliberately switched on in research labs.

79
00:05:16,220 --> 00:05:20,900
Chickens for example don't have teeth, but their distant ancestors did and the code for

80
00:05:20,900 --> 00:05:23,380
it is still buried in their DNA.

81
00:05:23,380 --> 00:05:27,460
Activate the right gene and you get a chicken with teeth.

82
00:05:27,460 --> 00:05:31,860
In the context of this wealth of research and evidence it's still beggars belief that

83
00:05:31,860 --> 00:05:37,200
people can not only display complete ignorance of evolutionary theory but feel qualified

84
00:05:37,200 --> 00:05:38,780
to lecture on it.

85
00:05:38,780 --> 00:05:42,300
This is what evolutionists have been searching for for hundreds of years.

86
00:05:42,300 --> 00:05:47,600
This is called the crocodile.

87
00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:52,340
Which brings us neatly to those often asked questions from creationists.

88
00:05:52,340 --> 00:05:57,800
The problem is we've searched high and low but we simply can't find any scientist moronically

89
00:05:57,800 --> 00:06:03,060
uneducated ill-read and intellectually vapid enough to think that the theory of evolution

90
00:06:03,060 --> 00:06:06,160
even suggests such a laughable idea.

91
00:06:06,160 --> 00:06:10,080
I want to be kind to Kirk Cameron rather than suggest that half his brain must have

92
00:06:10,080 --> 00:06:12,920
been sucked out in a freak vacuuming accident.

93
00:06:12,920 --> 00:06:17,200
So I'll keep the tape rolling and see if we can catch what fellow debater Brian Sapient

94
00:06:17,200 --> 00:06:18,920
thought of the crocodile idea.

95
00:06:18,920 --> 00:06:19,920
This is called the crocodile.

96
00:06:19,920 --> 00:06:20,920
Can you see this?

97
00:06:20,920 --> 00:06:21,920
Oh my god.

98
00:06:21,920 --> 00:06:22,920
I'm not.

99
00:06:22,920 --> 00:06:27,920
See Kirk, there's no crocodile because there are no species in between a crocodile and

100
00:06:27,920 --> 00:06:29,080
a duck.

101
00:06:29,080 --> 00:06:33,640
And if you knew anything about the subject you so ardently criticize you'd have learnt

102
00:06:33,640 --> 00:06:34,640
that.

103
00:06:34,640 --> 00:06:39,400
According to the evidence whether you accept it or not crocodiles and ducks are on completely

104
00:06:39,400 --> 00:06:45,000
separate branches of the evolutionary tree but there is a common ancestor and if finding

105
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:49,540
it is so important to you, good news, we found it decades ago.

106
00:06:49,540 --> 00:06:55,680
It's called the archosaur and it lives several million years before both crocodiles and ducks.

107
00:06:55,680 --> 00:06:56,880
Who's got the next question?

108
00:06:56,880 --> 00:06:57,880
Hands up.

109
00:06:57,880 --> 00:06:59,960
Oh god, you again.

110
00:06:59,960 --> 00:07:05,760
This has never found a genuine transitional form that is one kind of animal crossing over

111
00:07:05,760 --> 00:07:08,600
into another kind either living or in the fossil record.

112
00:07:08,600 --> 00:07:13,560
Kirk, I don't know if you've looked in a biology book recently but the fossil record is full

113
00:07:13,560 --> 00:07:16,800
of animals changing from one kind into another.

114
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:20,040
It's one of the reasons we know evolution happened.

115
00:07:20,040 --> 00:07:24,560
Every animal is a transition between what went before and what comes after.

116
00:07:24,560 --> 00:07:29,600
If you think we haven't captured the instantaneous moment that one species turns into another

117
00:07:29,600 --> 00:07:32,160
that's because there isn't one.

118
00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:36,880
It's like asking where's the intermediate form between this and this.

119
00:07:36,880 --> 00:07:41,220
We know that this species existed at one time and is now gone and it seems to have been

120
00:07:41,220 --> 00:07:43,140
replaced by this species.

121
00:07:43,140 --> 00:07:48,520
We can scour the archives and dig up as many transitional photos of George Bush as we like

122
00:07:48,520 --> 00:07:54,060
but we're never going to find a single shot of Dubya changing from a baby into a man.

123
00:07:54,060 --> 00:07:58,120
What we will find are the various transitional forms in between.

124
00:07:58,160 --> 00:08:02,560
If you're talking about gaps in the record Kirk, sure there are lots of them.

125
00:08:02,560 --> 00:08:06,920
This is all I could find when I googled images from the life of George Bush so of course

126
00:08:06,920 --> 00:08:08,300
there are gaps.

127
00:08:08,300 --> 00:08:12,520
If I went on a digging expedition I could probably find a hundred more but even if I

128
00:08:12,520 --> 00:08:17,640
had a thousand chronologically spaced photos of George Bush there would still be gaps in

129
00:08:17,640 --> 00:08:18,880
between.

130
00:08:18,880 --> 00:08:23,560
As I mentioned in the last video we now know that evolution just like the growth of George

131
00:08:23,560 --> 00:08:26,120
Bush doesn't happen evenly.

132
00:08:26,120 --> 00:08:31,200
The few years in between this photo and this one mark very few changes but there's been

133
00:08:31,200 --> 00:08:35,800
a huge change in the same period of time between this photo and this one.

134
00:08:35,800 --> 00:08:40,060
But even when evolution happens quickly it's still not instantaneous.

135
00:08:40,060 --> 00:08:45,120
For some animals we've got a very good fossil record and the time gaps between fossils are

136
00:08:45,120 --> 00:08:46,120
small.

137
00:08:46,120 --> 00:08:47,800
This shows evolution very clearly.

138
00:08:47,800 --> 00:08:51,880
For other animals the gaps are longer and the record is far less complete but there's

139
00:08:51,880 --> 00:08:56,640
no suggestion that a deity steps in whenever there's a gap in the fossil record and changes

140
00:08:56,640 --> 00:09:00,120
one animal into another.

141
00:09:00,120 --> 00:09:02,040
Yes I get that a lot.

142
00:09:02,040 --> 00:09:06,440
A theory in scientific nomenclature is the highest form of proof you can get.

143
00:09:06,440 --> 00:09:09,800
To go any higher you have to enter the realm of mathematics.

144
00:09:09,800 --> 00:09:14,400
In all the sciences there's still a lot more to discover, a lot more to understand and

145
00:09:14,400 --> 00:09:19,400
a lot more to explain whether it's atomic theory, the theory of gravity or the theory

146
00:09:19,400 --> 00:09:20,800
of evolution.

147
00:09:20,800 --> 00:09:25,480
These are all called theories and if the peanut butter man and crocoduck boy don't like the

148
00:09:25,480 --> 00:09:31,240
scientific terminology then get over it and accept that evolution is now a fact.

149
00:09:31,240 --> 00:09:36,520
It's so much a fact that researchers now depend on evolutionary theory to study antibiotic

150
00:09:36,520 --> 00:09:41,900
resistance and crop pests and new diseases and to develop new drugs.

151
00:09:41,900 --> 00:09:46,320
Fortunately for us the biologists who are making all these advances didn't get their

152
00:09:46,320 --> 00:09:49,720
education at the Ken Ham School of Evolutionary Theory.
