00:00.000 --> 00:05.120
I certainly don't believe that you came from ape-like creatures or anything like that.

00:05.120 --> 00:07.120
I mean, did your grandfather look like that?

00:07.120 --> 00:08.800
Did your grandfather look like that?

00:08.800 --> 00:10.480
Did your grandfather look like that?

00:10.480 --> 00:32.760
In the video Natural Selection Made Easy, I looked at heredity and showed a mechanism

00:32.760 --> 00:35.480
by which evolution could be predicted.

00:35.480 --> 00:40.440
There are so many observed examples of organisms changing that even fundamentalist preachers

00:40.440 --> 00:43.560
like Ken Ham can't pretend it doesn't happen.

00:43.560 --> 00:47.960
They've even embraced the idea in order to explain how Noah fitted all those animals

00:47.960 --> 00:49.800
onto the ark.

00:49.800 --> 00:54.920
But they don't accept that evolution can create new species or that evolution is responsible

00:54.920 --> 00:58.200
for the abundance of life we see all around us.

00:58.200 --> 01:02.000
So in this video I want to show some of the evidence that makes evolution an accepted

01:02.000 --> 01:05.480
fact among biologists all over the world.

01:05.480 --> 01:10.280
Previous videos showed how the earth's sedimentary rocks are like the pages of a book, taking

01:10.280 --> 01:12.160
us back through time.

01:12.160 --> 01:16.800
Nineteenth century geologists discovered that the lowest and oldest layers contained a small

01:16.800 --> 01:19.920
variety of very primitive marine species.

01:19.920 --> 01:24.200
Higher sedimentary layers held more varied and more complex creatures.

01:24.200 --> 01:28.520
The progression suggested that these animals didn't appear suddenly but were gradually

01:28.520 --> 01:30.180
evolving.

01:30.180 --> 01:32.580
But there were sudden disappearances.

01:32.580 --> 01:39.100
This layer of rock, for example, marks a catastrophic mass extinction about 250 million years ago.

01:39.100 --> 01:43.700
The rocks below this line are full of marine fossils but in the rocks above they're all

01:43.700 --> 01:44.960
gone.

01:44.960 --> 01:50.180
There were five global mass extinctions we know of, each one wiping out between 50 and

01:50.180 --> 01:52.460
95% of species.

01:52.460 --> 01:57.740
Each was followed by the gradual recolonisation of the earth by surviving organisms that again

01:57.740 --> 02:02.920
began to change and become more complex until the next mass extinction.

02:02.920 --> 02:07.580
If this increasing complexity really did mean some kind of evolution, we'd expect to see

02:07.580 --> 02:12.860
it in individual species as we track their fossils through millions of years of sedimentary

02:12.860 --> 02:13.860
rock.

02:13.860 --> 02:14.860
And we do.

02:14.860 --> 02:19.120
Either each species is suddenly being killed off, only to be replaced by the sudden appearance

02:19.120 --> 02:23.740
of something that's almost identical, or we're seeing the changing morphology of a single

02:23.740 --> 02:25.780
species through time.

02:25.820 --> 02:31.020
We'd also expect to see traces of an animal's evolutionary ancestry in its morphology today,

02:31.020 --> 02:32.300
and we do.

02:32.300 --> 02:34.780
Take a look at this skeleton of an ape's hand.

02:34.780 --> 02:38.260
It looks just like a human hand, except it's not.

02:38.260 --> 02:40.860
In fact, it's not an ape's hand either.

02:40.860 --> 02:45.820
It's a whale's hand, or at least what used to be a hand in its ancestral past and is

02:45.820 --> 02:47.740
now used as a flipper.

02:47.740 --> 02:52.140
The morphology of animals today is full of remnant body parts that have been changed

02:52.140 --> 02:55.620
and adapted, just as evolution predicts.

02:55.660 --> 02:59.860
In the video on natural selection, I showed how a hypothetical animal might evolve into

02:59.860 --> 03:01.700
two different species.

03:01.700 --> 03:06.820
At first, the two types would be able to reproduce, then reproduce with difficulty, and then not

03:06.820 --> 03:08.640
reproduce at all.

03:08.640 --> 03:13.580
We can't watch it happening in mammals today because it takes several thousand generations,

03:13.580 --> 03:17.340
but we can see snapshots of it frozen in time.

03:17.340 --> 03:21.580
Modern horses, for example, separated from zebras several million years ago.

03:21.580 --> 03:27.500
They can still reproduce, but with difficulty, because a horse's DNA has 64 chromosomes

03:27.500 --> 03:29.540
and a zebra's 44.

03:29.540 --> 03:34.340
When an offspring is produced, it's sterile, exactly what evolution would predict.

03:34.340 --> 03:40.380
An even better example is found around mountains, where a species evolves as it spreads geographically.

03:40.380 --> 03:44.540
Each species can interbreed with the one next to it, but the species at each end of the

03:44.540 --> 03:47.660
line can't interbreed with each other.

03:47.660 --> 03:52.660
Among organisms with very fast reproduction rates, such as bacteria and flies, separation

03:52.660 --> 03:55.660
into new species has indeed been seen.

03:55.660 --> 03:59.760
This, for example, is a flavobacterium that eats nylon.

03:59.760 --> 04:04.380
It was found in a waste outlet near a Japanese factory that produces the stuff.

04:04.380 --> 04:10.140
The problem is, nylon was only invented in 1935 and is completely synthetic and undigestible

04:10.140 --> 04:12.300
to other bacteria.

04:12.300 --> 04:18.140
Was nylon-eating bacteria for some reason present in the nylon-free Garden of Eden and

04:18.140 --> 04:20.260
managed not to starve to death?

04:20.260 --> 04:25.700
Or did God endow some bacteria with the gift of nylon digestion in 1935?

04:25.700 --> 04:30.840
Or does this fit perfectly with evolution and they evolve because of a mutation sometime

04:30.840 --> 04:35.740
between the invention of nylon and their discovery 40 years later?

04:35.740 --> 04:40.780
The answer came when researchers kept a completely different bacterium in a similar nylon-rich

04:40.780 --> 04:44.140
environment and the same mutation occurred.

04:44.140 --> 04:49.960
DNA research has only added to the overwhelming evidence of evolution, but it has also completely

04:49.960 --> 04:54.980
shaken up the evolutionary tree and shown in much greater detail which animals share

04:54.980 --> 04:59.060
a common ancestor and when they separated.

04:59.060 --> 05:04.100
Researchers are now manipulating DNA to discover a treasure trove of evolutionary information.

05:04.100 --> 05:08.860
It's long been known that ancestral traits buried deep inside DNA can get switched on

05:08.860 --> 05:12.060
by accident with very obvious results.

05:12.060 --> 05:16.220
But they can also now be deliberately switched on in research labs.

05:16.220 --> 05:20.900
Chickens for example don't have teeth, but their distant ancestors did and the code for

05:20.900 --> 05:23.380
it is still buried in their DNA.

05:23.380 --> 05:27.460
Activate the right gene and you get a chicken with teeth.

05:27.460 --> 05:31.860
In the context of this wealth of research and evidence it's still beggars belief that

05:31.860 --> 05:37.200
people can not only display complete ignorance of evolutionary theory but feel qualified

05:37.200 --> 05:38.780
to lecture on it.

05:38.780 --> 05:42.300
This is what evolutionists have been searching for for hundreds of years.

05:42.300 --> 05:47.600
This is called the crocodile.

05:47.600 --> 05:52.340
Which brings us neatly to those often asked questions from creationists.

05:52.340 --> 05:57.800
The problem is we've searched high and low but we simply can't find any scientist moronically

05:57.800 --> 06:03.060
uneducated ill-read and intellectually vapid enough to think that the theory of evolution

06:03.060 --> 06:06.160
even suggests such a laughable idea.

06:06.160 --> 06:10.080
I want to be kind to Kirk Cameron rather than suggest that half his brain must have

06:10.080 --> 06:12.920
been sucked out in a freak vacuuming accident.

06:12.920 --> 06:17.200
So I'll keep the tape rolling and see if we can catch what fellow debater Brian Sapient

06:17.200 --> 06:18.920
thought of the crocodile idea.

06:18.920 --> 06:19.920
This is called the crocodile.

06:19.920 --> 06:20.920
Can you see this?

06:20.920 --> 06:21.920
Oh my god.

06:21.920 --> 06:22.920
I'm not.

06:22.920 --> 06:27.920
See Kirk, there's no crocodile because there are no species in between a crocodile and

06:27.920 --> 06:29.080
a duck.

06:29.080 --> 06:33.640
And if you knew anything about the subject you so ardently criticize you'd have learnt

06:33.640 --> 06:34.640
that.

06:34.640 --> 06:39.400
According to the evidence whether you accept it or not crocodiles and ducks are on completely

06:39.400 --> 06:45.000
separate branches of the evolutionary tree but there is a common ancestor and if finding

06:45.000 --> 06:49.540
it is so important to you, good news, we found it decades ago.

06:49.540 --> 06:55.680
It's called the archosaur and it lives several million years before both crocodiles and ducks.

06:55.680 --> 06:56.880
Who's got the next question?

06:56.880 --> 06:57.880
Hands up.

06:57.880 --> 06:59.960
Oh god, you again.

06:59.960 --> 07:05.760
This has never found a genuine transitional form that is one kind of animal crossing over

07:05.760 --> 07:08.600
into another kind either living or in the fossil record.

07:08.600 --> 07:13.560
Kirk, I don't know if you've looked in a biology book recently but the fossil record is full

07:13.560 --> 07:16.800
of animals changing from one kind into another.

07:16.800 --> 07:20.040
It's one of the reasons we know evolution happened.

07:20.040 --> 07:24.560
Every animal is a transition between what went before and what comes after.

07:24.560 --> 07:29.600
If you think we haven't captured the instantaneous moment that one species turns into another

07:29.600 --> 07:32.160
that's because there isn't one.

07:32.160 --> 07:36.880
It's like asking where's the intermediate form between this and this.

07:36.880 --> 07:41.220
We know that this species existed at one time and is now gone and it seems to have been

07:41.220 --> 07:43.140
replaced by this species.

07:43.140 --> 07:48.520
We can scour the archives and dig up as many transitional photos of George Bush as we like

07:48.520 --> 07:54.060
but we're never going to find a single shot of Dubya changing from a baby into a man.

07:54.060 --> 07:58.120
What we will find are the various transitional forms in between.

07:58.160 --> 08:02.560
If you're talking about gaps in the record Kirk, sure there are lots of them.

08:02.560 --> 08:06.920
This is all I could find when I googled images from the life of George Bush so of course

08:06.920 --> 08:08.300
there are gaps.

08:08.300 --> 08:12.520
If I went on a digging expedition I could probably find a hundred more but even if I

08:12.520 --> 08:17.640
had a thousand chronologically spaced photos of George Bush there would still be gaps in

08:17.640 --> 08:18.880
between.

08:18.880 --> 08:23.560
As I mentioned in the last video we now know that evolution just like the growth of George

08:23.560 --> 08:26.120
Bush doesn't happen evenly.

08:26.120 --> 08:31.200
The few years in between this photo and this one mark very few changes but there's been

08:31.200 --> 08:35.800
a huge change in the same period of time between this photo and this one.

08:35.800 --> 08:40.060
But even when evolution happens quickly it's still not instantaneous.

08:40.060 --> 08:45.120
For some animals we've got a very good fossil record and the time gaps between fossils are

08:45.120 --> 08:46.120
small.

08:46.120 --> 08:47.800
This shows evolution very clearly.

08:47.800 --> 08:51.880
For other animals the gaps are longer and the record is far less complete but there's

08:51.880 --> 08:56.640
no suggestion that a deity steps in whenever there's a gap in the fossil record and changes

08:56.640 --> 09:00.120
one animal into another.

09:00.120 --> 09:02.040
Yes I get that a lot.

09:02.040 --> 09:06.440
A theory in scientific nomenclature is the highest form of proof you can get.

09:06.440 --> 09:09.800
To go any higher you have to enter the realm of mathematics.

09:09.800 --> 09:14.400
In all the sciences there's still a lot more to discover, a lot more to understand and

09:14.400 --> 09:19.400
a lot more to explain whether it's atomic theory, the theory of gravity or the theory

09:19.400 --> 09:20.800
of evolution.

09:20.800 --> 09:25.480
These are all called theories and if the peanut butter man and crocoduck boy don't like the

09:25.480 --> 09:31.240
scientific terminology then get over it and accept that evolution is now a fact.

09:31.240 --> 09:36.520
It's so much a fact that researchers now depend on evolutionary theory to study antibiotic

09:36.520 --> 09:41.900
resistance and crop pests and new diseases and to develop new drugs.

09:41.900 --> 09:46.320
Fortunately for us the biologists who are making all these advances didn't get their

09:46.320 --> 09:49.720
education at the Ken Ham School of Evolutionary Theory.
