0	5120	I certainly don't believe that you came from ape-like creatures or anything like that.
5120	7120	I mean, did your grandfather look like that?
7120	8800	Did your grandfather look like that?
8800	10480	Did your grandfather look like that?
10480	32760	In the video Natural Selection Made Easy, I looked at heredity and showed a mechanism
32760	35480	by which evolution could be predicted.
35480	40440	There are so many observed examples of organisms changing that even fundamentalist preachers
40440	43560	like Ken Ham can't pretend it doesn't happen.
43560	47960	They've even embraced the idea in order to explain how Noah fitted all those animals
47960	49800	onto the ark.
49800	54920	But they don't accept that evolution can create new species or that evolution is responsible
54920	58200	for the abundance of life we see all around us.
58200	62000	So in this video I want to show some of the evidence that makes evolution an accepted
62000	65480	fact among biologists all over the world.
65480	70280	Previous videos showed how the earth's sedimentary rocks are like the pages of a book, taking
70280	72160	us back through time.
72160	76800	Nineteenth century geologists discovered that the lowest and oldest layers contained a small
76800	79920	variety of very primitive marine species.
79920	84200	Higher sedimentary layers held more varied and more complex creatures.
84200	88520	The progression suggested that these animals didn't appear suddenly but were gradually
88520	90180	evolving.
90180	92580	But there were sudden disappearances.
92580	99100	This layer of rock, for example, marks a catastrophic mass extinction about 250 million years ago.
99100	103700	The rocks below this line are full of marine fossils but in the rocks above they're all
103700	104960	gone.
104960	110180	There were five global mass extinctions we know of, each one wiping out between 50 and
110180	112460	95% of species.
112460	117740	Each was followed by the gradual recolonisation of the earth by surviving organisms that again
117740	122920	began to change and become more complex until the next mass extinction.
122920	127580	If this increasing complexity really did mean some kind of evolution, we'd expect to see
127580	132860	it in individual species as we track their fossils through millions of years of sedimentary
132860	133860	rock.
133860	134860	And we do.
134860	139120	Either each species is suddenly being killed off, only to be replaced by the sudden appearance
139120	143740	of something that's almost identical, or we're seeing the changing morphology of a single
143740	145780	species through time.
145820	151020	We'd also expect to see traces of an animal's evolutionary ancestry in its morphology today,
151020	152300	and we do.
152300	154780	Take a look at this skeleton of an ape's hand.
154780	158260	It looks just like a human hand, except it's not.
158260	160860	In fact, it's not an ape's hand either.
160860	165820	It's a whale's hand, or at least what used to be a hand in its ancestral past and is
165820	167740	now used as a flipper.
167740	172140	The morphology of animals today is full of remnant body parts that have been changed
172140	175620	and adapted, just as evolution predicts.
175660	179860	In the video on natural selection, I showed how a hypothetical animal might evolve into
179860	181700	two different species.
181700	186820	At first, the two types would be able to reproduce, then reproduce with difficulty, and then not
186820	188640	reproduce at all.
188640	193580	We can't watch it happening in mammals today because it takes several thousand generations,
193580	197340	but we can see snapshots of it frozen in time.
197340	201580	Modern horses, for example, separated from zebras several million years ago.
201580	207500	They can still reproduce, but with difficulty, because a horse's DNA has 64 chromosomes
207500	209540	and a zebra's 44.
209540	214340	When an offspring is produced, it's sterile, exactly what evolution would predict.
214340	220380	An even better example is found around mountains, where a species evolves as it spreads geographically.
220380	224540	Each species can interbreed with the one next to it, but the species at each end of the
224540	227660	line can't interbreed with each other.
227660	232660	Among organisms with very fast reproduction rates, such as bacteria and flies, separation
232660	235660	into new species has indeed been seen.
235660	239760	This, for example, is a flavobacterium that eats nylon.
239760	244380	It was found in a waste outlet near a Japanese factory that produces the stuff.
244380	250140	The problem is, nylon was only invented in 1935 and is completely synthetic and undigestible
250140	252300	to other bacteria.
252300	258140	Was nylon-eating bacteria for some reason present in the nylon-free Garden of Eden and
258140	260260	managed not to starve to death?
260260	265700	Or did God endow some bacteria with the gift of nylon digestion in 1935?
265700	270840	Or does this fit perfectly with evolution and they evolve because of a mutation sometime
270840	275740	between the invention of nylon and their discovery 40 years later?
275740	280780	The answer came when researchers kept a completely different bacterium in a similar nylon-rich
280780	284140	environment and the same mutation occurred.
284140	289960	DNA research has only added to the overwhelming evidence of evolution, but it has also completely
289960	294980	shaken up the evolutionary tree and shown in much greater detail which animals share
294980	299060	a common ancestor and when they separated.
299060	304100	Researchers are now manipulating DNA to discover a treasure trove of evolutionary information.
304100	308860	It's long been known that ancestral traits buried deep inside DNA can get switched on
308860	312060	by accident with very obvious results.
312060	316220	But they can also now be deliberately switched on in research labs.
316220	320900	Chickens for example don't have teeth, but their distant ancestors did and the code for
320900	323380	it is still buried in their DNA.
323380	327460	Activate the right gene and you get a chicken with teeth.
327460	331860	In the context of this wealth of research and evidence it's still beggars belief that
331860	337200	people can not only display complete ignorance of evolutionary theory but feel qualified
337200	338780	to lecture on it.
338780	342300	This is what evolutionists have been searching for for hundreds of years.
342300	347600	This is called the crocodile.
347600	352340	Which brings us neatly to those often asked questions from creationists.
352340	357800	The problem is we've searched high and low but we simply can't find any scientist moronically
357800	363060	uneducated ill-read and intellectually vapid enough to think that the theory of evolution
363060	366160	even suggests such a laughable idea.
366160	370080	I want to be kind to Kirk Cameron rather than suggest that half his brain must have
370080	372920	been sucked out in a freak vacuuming accident.
372920	377200	So I'll keep the tape rolling and see if we can catch what fellow debater Brian Sapient
377200	378920	thought of the crocodile idea.
378920	379920	This is called the crocodile.
379920	380920	Can you see this?
380920	381920	Oh my god.
381920	382920	I'm not.
382920	387920	See Kirk, there's no crocodile because there are no species in between a crocodile and
387920	389080	a duck.
389080	393640	And if you knew anything about the subject you so ardently criticize you'd have learnt
393640	394640	that.
394640	399400	According to the evidence whether you accept it or not crocodiles and ducks are on completely
399400	405000	separate branches of the evolutionary tree but there is a common ancestor and if finding
405000	409540	it is so important to you, good news, we found it decades ago.
409540	415680	It's called the archosaur and it lives several million years before both crocodiles and ducks.
415680	416880	Who's got the next question?
416880	417880	Hands up.
417880	419960	Oh god, you again.
419960	425760	This has never found a genuine transitional form that is one kind of animal crossing over
425760	428600	into another kind either living or in the fossil record.
428600	433560	Kirk, I don't know if you've looked in a biology book recently but the fossil record is full
433560	436800	of animals changing from one kind into another.
436800	440040	It's one of the reasons we know evolution happened.
440040	444560	Every animal is a transition between what went before and what comes after.
444560	449600	If you think we haven't captured the instantaneous moment that one species turns into another
449600	452160	that's because there isn't one.
452160	456880	It's like asking where's the intermediate form between this and this.
456880	461220	We know that this species existed at one time and is now gone and it seems to have been
461220	463140	replaced by this species.
463140	468520	We can scour the archives and dig up as many transitional photos of George Bush as we like
468520	474060	but we're never going to find a single shot of Dubya changing from a baby into a man.
474060	478120	What we will find are the various transitional forms in between.
478160	482560	If you're talking about gaps in the record Kirk, sure there are lots of them.
482560	486920	This is all I could find when I googled images from the life of George Bush so of course
486920	488300	there are gaps.
488300	492520	If I went on a digging expedition I could probably find a hundred more but even if I
492520	497640	had a thousand chronologically spaced photos of George Bush there would still be gaps in
497640	498880	between.
498880	503560	As I mentioned in the last video we now know that evolution just like the growth of George
503560	506120	Bush doesn't happen evenly.
506120	511200	The few years in between this photo and this one mark very few changes but there's been
511200	515800	a huge change in the same period of time between this photo and this one.
515800	520060	But even when evolution happens quickly it's still not instantaneous.
520060	525120	For some animals we've got a very good fossil record and the time gaps between fossils are
525120	526120	small.
526120	527800	This shows evolution very clearly.
527800	531880	For other animals the gaps are longer and the record is far less complete but there's
531880	536640	no suggestion that a deity steps in whenever there's a gap in the fossil record and changes
536640	540120	one animal into another.
540120	542040	Yes I get that a lot.
542040	546440	A theory in scientific nomenclature is the highest form of proof you can get.
546440	549800	To go any higher you have to enter the realm of mathematics.
549800	554400	In all the sciences there's still a lot more to discover, a lot more to understand and
554400	559400	a lot more to explain whether it's atomic theory, the theory of gravity or the theory
559400	560800	of evolution.
560800	565480	These are all called theories and if the peanut butter man and crocoduck boy don't like the
565480	571240	scientific terminology then get over it and accept that evolution is now a fact.
571240	576520	It's so much a fact that researchers now depend on evolutionary theory to study antibiotic
576520	581900	resistance and crop pests and new diseases and to develop new drugs.
581900	586320	Fortunately for us the biologists who are making all these advances didn't get their
586320	589720	education at the Ken Ham School of Evolutionary Theory.
