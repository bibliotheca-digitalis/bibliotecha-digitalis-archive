0	5000	In the 17th century, a theologian called James Ussher worked out the age of the universe
5000	7000	based on the chronology of the Bible.
7000	13000	It was created, he concluded, in a week in October 4004 BC.
13000	19000	Even today millions of people still believe that this 17th century calculation is about right
19000	25000	and that the overwhelming evidence of geology, cosmology, paleontology, chemistry, astrophysics,
25000	29000	geophysics, stratigraphy and biology is wrong.
29000	35000	So let's take a look at what that evidence is, starting with a principle that even creationists don't dispute.
35000	40000	The golden rule is that newer sedimentary deposits are always laid on top of older ones.
40000	45000	So except where rocks have been folded, this orange bed would be older than the green one
45000	48000	and the green one is older than the blue one.
48000	53000	Geologists can then follow a single bed to make similar deductions in a different locality.
53000	58000	The dark grey bed may be at the surface or even at a higher point than the others
58000	63000	but it's older than all of them and the light grey bed is older still.
63000	67000	What we end up with is what's called the geological column.
67000	72000	To get the absolute dates of these rocks scientists use a variety of different methods.
72000	75000	I'll start with one of the easiest and most recent.
75000	80000	We all know trees have rings because in summer they grow faster than in winter
80000	85000	but seasonal growing conditions vary according to the weather so the bands will vary in size.
85000	92000	Each time period in each geographical location has its own distinctive pattern of tree rings like a fingerprint.
92000	99000	So if we take wood of a known age we can match the oldest part of it with the youngest part of another piece of wood
99000	101000	and so on back through time.
101000	107000	Back 10,000 years in fact and already way beyond the biblical chronology.
107000	113000	OK, I'll spend a bit of time on this one because creationist preachers seem to be obsessed with it.
113000	118000	Our upper atmosphere is constantly being bombarded by radiation from the sun.
118000	122000	When a stray neutron hits a nitrogen atom it changes it into carbon
122000	128000	but this is a heavy and unstable form of carbon called carbon 14 or C14.
128000	131000	The normal form of carbon is C12.
131000	135000	In the atmosphere C14 combines with oxygen to make carbon dioxide
135000	141000	which is then absorbed by plants and into the bodies of animals that eat the plants.
141000	148000	The ratio of these two isotopes in animals and plants is roughly the same as the ratio in the atmosphere around them.
148000	155000	But when the animal or plant dies C14 decays over time and reverts back to nitrogen.
155000	162000	So compared to C12 which doesn't change the amount of C14 falls at a constant measurable rate.
162000	168000	By measuring this ratio inside the dead animal or plant scientists can find out when it died.
168000	175000	Before I look at other dating techniques I'll bat a few hoary old myths about C14 out of the ballpark.
175000	177000	No, it's not.
177000	182000	But sometimes, rarely, a sample is wrongly dated because it's contaminated.
182000	184000	Bacteria, dead skin, fungus.
184000	191000	If care isn't taken it's the carbon in these contaminants that gets dated rather than the sample itself.
191000	197000	That's why samples from different parts of the same plant or animal have been known to give different results.
197000	200000	But a similar thing can happen with any kind of sampling.
200000	207000	Contaminated samples don't invalidate the principle of DNA analysis or chromatography or spectroscopy.
207000	210000	We know they work and we know carbon dating works.
210000	214000	Firstly, carbon dating can be checked against artefacts of known age.
214000	219000	Secondly, it can be checked by sending the same artefact to different labs for analysis.
219000	224000	Thirdly, let's take a sample of organic material from each of these layers.
224000	230000	If carbon dating was random nonsense you'd expect the chronological order of these samples to be all over the place.
230000	232000	But that doesn't happen.
232000	237000	The results show each of these samples in its correct chronological order.
237000	241000	The ones from the upper beds are younger and the ones from the lower beds are older.
241000	247000	Is it magic or is it because carbon dating works and that's why it's used?
247000	252000	To quote Kent Hovind, samples don't come with labels attached telling the lab their age.
252000	257000	Testing is always blind. If it's not blind it's not science.
257000	264000	And if creationists don't trust the carbon dating method they're perfectly welcome to conduct their own blind test to prove it wrong.
264000	269000	But carbon dating isn't used on diamonds and coal and for very good reason.
269000	274000	As I explained C14 is formed when neutrons collide with nitrogen atoms.
274000	278000	The C14 used in carbon dating originated in the atmosphere.
278000	284000	But you can also get it deep underground in places where decaying uranium is giving off neutrons.
284000	293000	Coal and diamonds are made of carbon so you'd expect to find higher levels of C14 in coal and diamonds close to rocks that contain uranium.
293000	296000	And much lower levels away from those rocks.
296000	299000	And that's exactly what we do find.
299000	306000	Carbon dating is only used and only useful for dating organic material in the top most sedimentary layers.
306000	312000	Now that we've got carbon dating out of the way let's quickly run through a few more absolute dating methods.
312000	319000	Biologists know that human DNA mutates at a fairly regular rate and they can trace these mutations back.
319000	322000	Like following the branches of a tree back to the trunk.
322000	330000	It's not a greatly accurate method but it does give a rough idea of when humans migrated and a very definite idea of where.
330000	340000	It doesn't lead back to Mount Ararat 4,000 years ago but to Africa around 50,000 years ago just as other dating methods suggested it should.
340000	347000	Every 250,000 years or so the Earth's magnetic fields flip over and the South Pole becomes the North Pole.
347000	352000	Magnetized minerals within rocks show the polarity of the Earth when the rocks were laid down.
352000	359000	So throughout the geological column rocks show a regular magnetic banding depending on the polarity of the Earth.
359000	361000	And that can be dated.
361000	365000	Potassium argon dating works on the same principle as carbon dating.
365000	370000	But instead of carbon decaying to nitrogen we have potassium decaying to argon.
370000	376000	And instead of a half-life of 5,500 years we have a half-life of 1.3 billion years.
376000	382000	That means the method can be used for dating rocks and fossils hundreds of millions of years old.
382000	387000	The technique has largely been replaced with the far more accurate argon-argon method.
387000	395000	And there are other decay processes that can be measured each with different half-lives such as uranium thorium and rubidium strontium.
395000	402000	Radiometric dating takes us back to the oldest rocks we found on Earth 3.8 billion years old.
402000	406000	If you want to go back even further you have to look into space.
406000	414000	My video The History of the Universe Made Easy explains how we can calculate the age of stars and galaxies so I won't repeat that here.
414000	416000	Just take a look at the video.
416000	421000	What's important is that the results fit perfectly with the chronology we find on Earth.
421000	426000	The Sun for example doesn't turn out to be younger than the Earth or older than the universe.
426000	432000	Its age based on the amount of hydrogen fused into helium is exactly what you'd expect.
432000	441000	As with dating methods devised for rocks on Earth the method for measuring the age of stars and galaxies is devised first and tested afterwards.
441000	450000	There's no way of knowing in advance what age these tests will show but every time the age confirms the known chronology of our world.
450000	455000	As technology expands new dating techniques are constantly being developed.
455000	463000	If the world really was around 6,000 years old you'd expect them to show it or at least disprove the established chronology but they don't.
463000	466000	Every new technique confirms what we know.
466000	472000	There's thermoluminescence that can measure the number of trapped electrons on the surface of volcanic rock.
472000	478000	The speed that continents are drifting can be measured today so their position millions of years ago can be calculated.
478000	483000	It matches perfectly with the geological chronology we've already worked out.
483000	490000	Climatic banding in sedimentary rocks can be measured caused by a wobble in the Earth's motion every 12,000 years.
490000	496000	I could go on but there's no time here to list every dating method let alone spell out the details of how they work.
496000	509000	But if creationist preachers are so convinced that every single dating method is wrong and that the single story they tell is the result of either a huge coincidence or a giant conspiracy it's very easy for them to prove it.
509000	512000	Hey guys do your own tests.
512000	516000	After all a few creationists have university degrees in biology and geology.
516000	520000	Okay then devise a dating technique of your own choosing.
520000	522000	Explain publicly how it works.
522000	527000	Have it tested against samples whose age we all agree on so we know it works.
527000	535000	Then go out and take samples of sedimentary rocks throughout the geological column and have them tested by the method you've devised.
535000	541000	Not surprisingly not one of the so-called creation science organizations has bothered to do this.
541000	543000	Why not?
543000	551000	If the Bible is right then all the samples would date to around 4,000 years ago and provide strong evidence that the biblical flood was real.
551000	562000	But if the Bible is wrong then the dates will be much older and more importantly the chronological order of the samples will be in perfect accord with their comparative ages in the geological column.
562000	571000	For some reason so-called creation scientists despite their professed faith that the Bible is right don't think that's a risk worth taking.
