00:00.000 --> 00:05.000
In the 17th century, a theologian called James Ussher worked out the age of the universe

00:05.000 --> 00:07.000
based on the chronology of the Bible.

00:07.000 --> 00:13.000
It was created, he concluded, in a week in October 4004 BC.

00:13.000 --> 00:19.000
Even today millions of people still believe that this 17th century calculation is about right

00:19.000 --> 00:25.000
and that the overwhelming evidence of geology, cosmology, paleontology, chemistry, astrophysics,

00:25.000 --> 00:29.000
geophysics, stratigraphy and biology is wrong.

00:29.000 --> 00:35.000
So let's take a look at what that evidence is, starting with a principle that even creationists don't dispute.

00:35.000 --> 00:40.000
The golden rule is that newer sedimentary deposits are always laid on top of older ones.

00:40.000 --> 00:45.000
So except where rocks have been folded, this orange bed would be older than the green one

00:45.000 --> 00:48.000
and the green one is older than the blue one.

00:48.000 --> 00:53.000
Geologists can then follow a single bed to make similar deductions in a different locality.

00:53.000 --> 00:58.000
The dark grey bed may be at the surface or even at a higher point than the others

00:58.000 --> 01:03.000
but it's older than all of them and the light grey bed is older still.

01:03.000 --> 01:07.000
What we end up with is what's called the geological column.

01:07.000 --> 01:12.000
To get the absolute dates of these rocks scientists use a variety of different methods.

01:12.000 --> 01:15.000
I'll start with one of the easiest and most recent.

01:15.000 --> 01:20.000
We all know trees have rings because in summer they grow faster than in winter

01:20.000 --> 01:25.000
but seasonal growing conditions vary according to the weather so the bands will vary in size.

01:25.000 --> 01:32.000
Each time period in each geographical location has its own distinctive pattern of tree rings like a fingerprint.

01:32.000 --> 01:39.000
So if we take wood of a known age we can match the oldest part of it with the youngest part of another piece of wood

01:39.000 --> 01:41.000
and so on back through time.

01:41.000 --> 01:47.000
Back 10,000 years in fact and already way beyond the biblical chronology.

01:47.000 --> 01:53.000
OK, I'll spend a bit of time on this one because creationist preachers seem to be obsessed with it.

01:53.000 --> 01:58.000
Our upper atmosphere is constantly being bombarded by radiation from the sun.

01:58.000 --> 02:02.000
When a stray neutron hits a nitrogen atom it changes it into carbon

02:02.000 --> 02:08.000
but this is a heavy and unstable form of carbon called carbon 14 or C14.

02:08.000 --> 02:11.000
The normal form of carbon is C12.

02:11.000 --> 02:15.000
In the atmosphere C14 combines with oxygen to make carbon dioxide

02:15.000 --> 02:21.000
which is then absorbed by plants and into the bodies of animals that eat the plants.

02:21.000 --> 02:28.000
The ratio of these two isotopes in animals and plants is roughly the same as the ratio in the atmosphere around them.

02:28.000 --> 02:35.000
But when the animal or plant dies C14 decays over time and reverts back to nitrogen.

02:35.000 --> 02:42.000
So compared to C12 which doesn't change the amount of C14 falls at a constant measurable rate.

02:42.000 --> 02:48.000
By measuring this ratio inside the dead animal or plant scientists can find out when it died.

02:48.000 --> 02:55.000
Before I look at other dating techniques I'll bat a few hoary old myths about C14 out of the ballpark.

02:55.000 --> 02:57.000
No, it's not.

02:57.000 --> 03:02.000
But sometimes, rarely, a sample is wrongly dated because it's contaminated.

03:02.000 --> 03:04.000
Bacteria, dead skin, fungus.

03:04.000 --> 03:11.000
If care isn't taken it's the carbon in these contaminants that gets dated rather than the sample itself.

03:11.000 --> 03:17.000
That's why samples from different parts of the same plant or animal have been known to give different results.

03:17.000 --> 03:20.000
But a similar thing can happen with any kind of sampling.

03:20.000 --> 03:27.000
Contaminated samples don't invalidate the principle of DNA analysis or chromatography or spectroscopy.

03:27.000 --> 03:30.000
We know they work and we know carbon dating works.

03:30.000 --> 03:34.000
Firstly, carbon dating can be checked against artefacts of known age.

03:34.000 --> 03:39.000
Secondly, it can be checked by sending the same artefact to different labs for analysis.

03:39.000 --> 03:44.000
Thirdly, let's take a sample of organic material from each of these layers.

03:44.000 --> 03:50.000
If carbon dating was random nonsense you'd expect the chronological order of these samples to be all over the place.

03:50.000 --> 03:52.000
But that doesn't happen.

03:52.000 --> 03:57.000
The results show each of these samples in its correct chronological order.

03:57.000 --> 04:01.000
The ones from the upper beds are younger and the ones from the lower beds are older.

04:01.000 --> 04:07.000
Is it magic or is it because carbon dating works and that's why it's used?

04:07.000 --> 04:12.000
To quote Kent Hovind, samples don't come with labels attached telling the lab their age.

04:12.000 --> 04:17.000
Testing is always blind. If it's not blind it's not science.

04:17.000 --> 04:24.000
And if creationists don't trust the carbon dating method they're perfectly welcome to conduct their own blind test to prove it wrong.

04:24.000 --> 04:29.000
But carbon dating isn't used on diamonds and coal and for very good reason.

04:29.000 --> 04:34.000
As I explained C14 is formed when neutrons collide with nitrogen atoms.

04:34.000 --> 04:38.000
The C14 used in carbon dating originated in the atmosphere.

04:38.000 --> 04:44.000
But you can also get it deep underground in places where decaying uranium is giving off neutrons.

04:44.000 --> 04:53.000
Coal and diamonds are made of carbon so you'd expect to find higher levels of C14 in coal and diamonds close to rocks that contain uranium.

04:53.000 --> 04:56.000
And much lower levels away from those rocks.

04:56.000 --> 04:59.000
And that's exactly what we do find.

04:59.000 --> 05:06.000
Carbon dating is only used and only useful for dating organic material in the top most sedimentary layers.

05:06.000 --> 05:12.000
Now that we've got carbon dating out of the way let's quickly run through a few more absolute dating methods.

05:12.000 --> 05:19.000
Biologists know that human DNA mutates at a fairly regular rate and they can trace these mutations back.

05:19.000 --> 05:22.000
Like following the branches of a tree back to the trunk.

05:22.000 --> 05:30.000
It's not a greatly accurate method but it does give a rough idea of when humans migrated and a very definite idea of where.

05:30.000 --> 05:40.000
It doesn't lead back to Mount Ararat 4,000 years ago but to Africa around 50,000 years ago just as other dating methods suggested it should.

05:40.000 --> 05:47.000
Every 250,000 years or so the Earth's magnetic fields flip over and the South Pole becomes the North Pole.

05:47.000 --> 05:52.000
Magnetized minerals within rocks show the polarity of the Earth when the rocks were laid down.

05:52.000 --> 05:59.000
So throughout the geological column rocks show a regular magnetic banding depending on the polarity of the Earth.

05:59.000 --> 06:01.000
And that can be dated.

06:01.000 --> 06:05.000
Potassium argon dating works on the same principle as carbon dating.

06:05.000 --> 06:10.000
But instead of carbon decaying to nitrogen we have potassium decaying to argon.

06:10.000 --> 06:16.000
And instead of a half-life of 5,500 years we have a half-life of 1.3 billion years.

06:16.000 --> 06:22.000
That means the method can be used for dating rocks and fossils hundreds of millions of years old.

06:22.000 --> 06:27.000
The technique has largely been replaced with the far more accurate argon-argon method.

06:27.000 --> 06:35.000
And there are other decay processes that can be measured each with different half-lives such as uranium thorium and rubidium strontium.

06:35.000 --> 06:42.000
Radiometric dating takes us back to the oldest rocks we found on Earth 3.8 billion years old.

06:42.000 --> 06:46.000
If you want to go back even further you have to look into space.

06:46.000 --> 06:54.000
My video The History of the Universe Made Easy explains how we can calculate the age of stars and galaxies so I won't repeat that here.

06:54.000 --> 06:56.000
Just take a look at the video.

06:56.000 --> 07:01.000
What's important is that the results fit perfectly with the chronology we find on Earth.

07:01.000 --> 07:06.000
The Sun for example doesn't turn out to be younger than the Earth or older than the universe.

07:06.000 --> 07:12.000
Its age based on the amount of hydrogen fused into helium is exactly what you'd expect.

07:12.000 --> 07:21.000
As with dating methods devised for rocks on Earth the method for measuring the age of stars and galaxies is devised first and tested afterwards.

07:21.000 --> 07:30.000
There's no way of knowing in advance what age these tests will show but every time the age confirms the known chronology of our world.

07:30.000 --> 07:35.000
As technology expands new dating techniques are constantly being developed.

07:35.000 --> 07:43.000
If the world really was around 6,000 years old you'd expect them to show it or at least disprove the established chronology but they don't.

07:43.000 --> 07:46.000
Every new technique confirms what we know.

07:46.000 --> 07:52.000
There's thermoluminescence that can measure the number of trapped electrons on the surface of volcanic rock.

07:52.000 --> 07:58.000
The speed that continents are drifting can be measured today so their position millions of years ago can be calculated.

07:58.000 --> 08:03.000
It matches perfectly with the geological chronology we've already worked out.

08:03.000 --> 08:10.000
Climatic banding in sedimentary rocks can be measured caused by a wobble in the Earth's motion every 12,000 years.

08:10.000 --> 08:16.000
I could go on but there's no time here to list every dating method let alone spell out the details of how they work.

08:16.000 --> 08:29.000
But if creationist preachers are so convinced that every single dating method is wrong and that the single story they tell is the result of either a huge coincidence or a giant conspiracy it's very easy for them to prove it.

08:29.000 --> 08:32.000
Hey guys do your own tests.

08:32.000 --> 08:36.000
After all a few creationists have university degrees in biology and geology.

08:36.000 --> 08:40.000
Okay then devise a dating technique of your own choosing.

08:40.000 --> 08:42.000
Explain publicly how it works.

08:42.000 --> 08:47.000
Have it tested against samples whose age we all agree on so we know it works.

08:47.000 --> 08:55.000
Then go out and take samples of sedimentary rocks throughout the geological column and have them tested by the method you've devised.

08:55.000 --> 09:01.000
Not surprisingly not one of the so-called creation science organizations has bothered to do this.

09:01.000 --> 09:03.000
Why not?

09:03.000 --> 09:11.000
If the Bible is right then all the samples would date to around 4,000 years ago and provide strong evidence that the biblical flood was real.

09:11.000 --> 09:22.000
But if the Bible is wrong then the dates will be much older and more importantly the chronological order of the samples will be in perfect accord with their comparative ages in the geological column.

09:22.000 --> 09:31.000
For some reason so-called creation scientists despite their professed faith that the Bible is right don't think that's a risk worth taking.
