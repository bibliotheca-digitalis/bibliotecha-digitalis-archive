1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,000
The one thing we all know about the theory of evolution is that it was proposed by Charles

2
00:00:08,200 --> 00:00:15,200
Darwin about 150 years ago. Well, not quite. The idea that organisms evolved was floating

3
00:00:15,400 --> 00:00:20,880
around for 2000 years before Darwin and was revived a bit before his time by Jean-Baptiste

4
00:00:20,880 --> 00:00:25,760
Lamarck. But it didn't gain much ground because there was no obvious mechanism by which one

5
00:00:25,760 --> 00:00:30,440
type of animal could change into another. Lamarck suggested that maybe animals changed

6
00:00:30,440 --> 00:00:36,120
because they felt the need to change. It didn't sound very scientific and with no evidence

7
00:00:36,120 --> 00:00:42,380
to support it the idea didn't go very far. What Darwin did was to show a plausible mechanism

8
00:00:42,380 --> 00:00:47,320
by which these changes could happen and let's not forget poor old Alfred Wallace who came

9
00:00:47,320 --> 00:00:53,000
up with the same idea and published it jointly. The paper they wrote was this. Darwin had

10
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:58,000
to come up with what he called the principle of natural selection. These days we tend to

11
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:03,060
call this the theory of evolution as a kind of shorthand but that's confusing because

12
00:01:03,060 --> 00:01:08,680
we also use the term theory of evolution to describe the fact that organisms evolve. I

13
00:01:08,680 --> 00:01:12,920
want to leave the physical evidence and the proof of evolution for the next video. In

14
00:01:12,920 --> 00:01:18,100
this video I just want to look at the mechanism to see whether sitting in our armchairs and

15
00:01:18,100 --> 00:01:23,060
not doing a bit of research we can predict evolution in animals purely on the basis of

16
00:01:23,060 --> 00:01:29,220
what we know. That animals replicate themselves and that the replication isn't perfect. There's

17
00:01:29,220 --> 00:01:34,620
always variation. Just taking these two known facts and nothing else what do we expect might

18
00:01:34,620 --> 00:01:40,300
happen if we keep copying a hypothetical animal generation after generation in a changing

19
00:01:40,300 --> 00:01:45,920
environment. Let's say the hypotheticus lives in a tropical climate grazing happily on grass

20
00:01:45,920 --> 00:01:51,480
and plants. We know from our two principles that not every hypotheticus is the same. This

21
00:01:51,480 --> 00:01:56,400
one has been born with a slightly longer neck. This one has slightly longer legs. The third

22
00:01:56,400 --> 00:02:01,960
has slightly longer claws and the fourth has a slightly hairier body. Over time herds of

23
00:02:01,960 --> 00:02:07,920
hypotheticus spread across the continent but the climate changes and the continent dries up. Only

24
00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:13,680
scrubby bushes and hardy tubers can survive. The hypotheticus with the slightly longer neck can

25
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:19,280
obviously get to more leaves than its neighbours. Inevitably taller and longer necked hypothetica

26
00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:25,120
are better fed and fitter and therefore reproduce more. A few generations later the drought has

27
00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:30,600
caused overall numbers to dwindle but there are more long-necked animals but natural selection

28
00:02:30,600 --> 00:02:35,520
doesn't suddenly stop just because average neck length has increased. The longest of the long

29
00:02:35,520 --> 00:02:41,680
necks now has an advantage over ordinary long necks and so the process continues. This principle

30
00:02:41,680 --> 00:02:47,200
is so easy to understand you have to wonder why it's so frequently misunderstood. So let's take

31
00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:56,680
this one step at a time and see where the confusion lies. Surely no argument there. By which I mean

32
00:02:56,680 --> 00:03:03,920
children are like their parents and inherit their traits. For example if it gets colder animals with

33
00:03:03,920 --> 00:03:10,840
hairier bodies will have a slightly better chance of survival. Pretty obvious? Like genes for hairy

34
00:03:10,840 --> 00:03:16,320
bodies. Genes that don't confer these advantages tend not to get passed on because the animals

35
00:03:16,320 --> 00:03:21,880
that carry them have a lower chance of survival. So if each of these steps is blindingly obvious

36
00:03:21,880 --> 00:03:28,760
then so is the conclusion. Over time animals should change. So why don't we see it? Why does

37
00:03:28,760 --> 00:03:35,000
a dog always give birth to a dog and a horse always gives birth to a horse? Well natural

38
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:40,120
selection doesn't suggest they shouldn't. What natural selection tells us is that a horse will

39
00:03:40,120 --> 00:03:45,440
always give birth to a horse that's very slightly different. After thousands of generations these

40
00:03:45,440 --> 00:03:51,320
differences add up. If you want an example of imperceptible changes you once looked like this.

41
00:03:51,320 --> 00:03:56,880
Maybe now you look something like this but you've probably looked in a mirror every day of your life.

42
00:03:56,880 --> 00:04:03,280
So when did this change take place? Did you notice it? Okay let's accept that organisms do change

43
00:04:03,280 --> 00:04:08,920
over time but how do we know they change into different species? A process known as speciation.

44
00:04:08,920 --> 00:04:14,400
I'll leave the evidence of speciation for the next video and look at this through the example

45
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:19,680
of our hypotheticus. We've seen how it can grow taller over time in order to survive a change of

46
00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:25,560
climate but there may be other ways of surviving. This hypotheticus for example may not be able to

47
00:04:25,560 --> 00:04:31,520
compete well for leaves but because of its longer claws it can dig more easily for tubers so it would

48
00:04:31,520 --> 00:04:36,880
have a better chance of survival and its genes would be passed on. The question is not whether

49
00:04:36,920 --> 00:04:42,040
the hypotheticus would change over time but what could possibly stop these changes from happening.

50
00:04:42,040 --> 00:04:48,760
Each generational change may be tiny but millions of years of accumulated change in a changing

51
00:04:48,760 --> 00:04:54,560
environment leads to two completely different animals. The question is whether their DNA would

52
00:04:54,560 --> 00:04:59,840
by then be so different that they could no longer breed. In the next video we'll see if there's any

53
00:04:59,840 --> 00:05:04,720
physical evidence to give us the answer. Anti-evolutionists have other objections

54
00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:11,720
which come up time and again. Well if you're imagining something like this then obviously

55
00:05:11,720 --> 00:05:17,120
you can't but using our theory of natural selection and breaking it down into evolutionary

56
00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:23,680
steps it's easy to understand. Simple organisms would have a sensory system like the amoeba which

57
00:05:23,680 --> 00:05:29,040
can sense heat, cold and chemicals. This could then evolve into a sensory system with a central

58
00:05:29,040 --> 00:05:34,960
processor just like in insects. Individuals with better organised centralised nervous systems would

59
00:05:34,960 --> 00:05:40,640
be able to do more things and pass on this improved trait. The central processor would get

60
00:05:40,640 --> 00:05:47,160
bigger and better. Again in stages. I won't spend time explaining the evolution of the eye here

61
00:05:47,160 --> 00:05:52,320
because there are a number of good videos on YouTube that do that job including this one.

62
00:05:52,320 --> 00:06:00,560
No, evolution requires variation. If information is a fancy way of saying bigger ears,

63
00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:07,040
hairier bodies and longer necks then fine, we know that happens. We can see it. If information

64
00:06:07,040 --> 00:06:12,560
means miraculously adding completely new parts then of course that doesn't happen and we know

65
00:06:12,560 --> 00:06:18,680
why. In the next video I'll show the evidence that animals adapt existing morphology for new tasks.

66
00:06:18,680 --> 00:06:26,000
Trying to characterise evolution as an accident doesn't change what it is or the evidence for it

67
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:31,480
and clearly there's nothing random about natural selection itself because genes survive only if

68
00:06:31,480 --> 00:06:37,720
they're best suited to survive. Mutations are just the inevitable result of DNA that didn't make a

69
00:06:37,720 --> 00:06:43,840
perfect copy and they're very common. The result is variation not some science fiction army of

70
00:06:43,840 --> 00:06:48,960
mutant ninja turtles. In fact there's new evidence that mutations don't play such an

71
00:06:48,960 --> 00:06:53,560
important role in natural selection and this might be a good time to look at what we've learned since

72
00:06:53,560 --> 00:06:59,440
Darwin. At the time Darwin and Wallace published their paper on natural selection Louis Pasteur

73
00:06:59,440 --> 00:07:05,600
was developing his pathogenic theory of medicine the idea that germs cause disease but it would be

74
00:07:05,600 --> 00:07:11,040
laughable to presume that biologists haven't learned anything new about pathogens since 1860.

75
00:07:11,040 --> 00:07:16,400
Of course our knowledge has advanced so why would our knowledge of evolution be any different?

76
00:07:16,400 --> 00:07:23,160
Biologists now know that mutations may not be the big engine of change. DNA can be changed by

77
00:07:23,160 --> 00:07:30,440
proteins which turn genes on and off a process known as cis regulation. Epigenetics is a huge

78
00:07:30,440 --> 00:07:36,120
field but it drastically changes Darwin's premise that genes are just passively sitting there being

79
00:07:36,120 --> 00:07:41,640
manipulated by environmental changes around them. Putting this very simply biologists have

80
00:07:41,640 --> 00:07:48,120
discovered that DNA can exaggerate traits that are being naturally selected. Instead of being the slow

81
00:07:48,120 --> 00:07:53,920
and steady change that Darwin envisaged evolution seems to happen in fits and starts. It's as if

82
00:07:53,920 --> 00:08:00,440
natural selection is occasionally turbocharged. Cis regulation and epigenetics might explain why

83
00:08:00,440 --> 00:08:05,920
this happens. These and many other discoveries don't overturn the 19th century idea of natural

84
00:08:06,200 --> 00:08:11,000
selection any more than modern microbiology overturns the discoveries of Louis Pasteur

85
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:17,360
but they do show that Darwin's ideas were crude and incomplete. There's a lot more to the mechanism

86
00:08:17,360 --> 00:08:23,200
that drives evolution yet to be uncovered. Okay so we've deduced from the comfort of our armchairs

87
00:08:23,200 --> 00:08:28,800
that evolution ought to happen. At least I hope so. Now it's time to do the research and see if

88
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:33,160
these ideas are supported by physical evidence. Meet me in the next video.

89
