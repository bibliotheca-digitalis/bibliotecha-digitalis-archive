0	7000	The one thing we all know about the theory of evolution is that it was proposed by Charles
8200	15200	Darwin about 150 years ago. Well, not quite. The idea that organisms evolved was floating
15400	20880	around for 2000 years before Darwin and was revived a bit before his time by Jean-Baptiste
20880	25760	Lamarck. But it didn't gain much ground because there was no obvious mechanism by which one
25760	30440	type of animal could change into another. Lamarck suggested that maybe animals changed
30440	36120	because they felt the need to change. It didn't sound very scientific and with no evidence
36120	42380	to support it the idea didn't go very far. What Darwin did was to show a plausible mechanism
42380	47320	by which these changes could happen and let's not forget poor old Alfred Wallace who came
47320	53000	up with the same idea and published it jointly. The paper they wrote was this. Darwin had
53000	58000	to come up with what he called the principle of natural selection. These days we tend to
58000	63060	call this the theory of evolution as a kind of shorthand but that's confusing because
63060	68680	we also use the term theory of evolution to describe the fact that organisms evolve. I
68680	72920	want to leave the physical evidence and the proof of evolution for the next video. In
72920	78100	this video I just want to look at the mechanism to see whether sitting in our armchairs and
78100	83060	not doing a bit of research we can predict evolution in animals purely on the basis of
83060	89220	what we know. That animals replicate themselves and that the replication isn't perfect. There's
89220	94620	always variation. Just taking these two known facts and nothing else what do we expect might
94620	100300	happen if we keep copying a hypothetical animal generation after generation in a changing
100300	105920	environment. Let's say the hypotheticus lives in a tropical climate grazing happily on grass
105920	111480	and plants. We know from our two principles that not every hypotheticus is the same. This
111480	116400	one has been born with a slightly longer neck. This one has slightly longer legs. The third
116400	121960	has slightly longer claws and the fourth has a slightly hairier body. Over time herds of
121960	127920	hypotheticus spread across the continent but the climate changes and the continent dries up. Only
127920	133680	scrubby bushes and hardy tubers can survive. The hypotheticus with the slightly longer neck can
133680	139280	obviously get to more leaves than its neighbours. Inevitably taller and longer necked hypothetica
139280	145120	are better fed and fitter and therefore reproduce more. A few generations later the drought has
145120	150600	caused overall numbers to dwindle but there are more long-necked animals but natural selection
150600	155520	doesn't suddenly stop just because average neck length has increased. The longest of the long
155520	161680	necks now has an advantage over ordinary long necks and so the process continues. This principle
161680	167200	is so easy to understand you have to wonder why it's so frequently misunderstood. So let's take
167200	176680	this one step at a time and see where the confusion lies. Surely no argument there. By which I mean
176680	183920	children are like their parents and inherit their traits. For example if it gets colder animals with
183920	190840	hairier bodies will have a slightly better chance of survival. Pretty obvious? Like genes for hairy
190840	196320	bodies. Genes that don't confer these advantages tend not to get passed on because the animals
196320	201880	that carry them have a lower chance of survival. So if each of these steps is blindingly obvious
201880	208760	then so is the conclusion. Over time animals should change. So why don't we see it? Why does
208760	215000	a dog always give birth to a dog and a horse always gives birth to a horse? Well natural
215000	220120	selection doesn't suggest they shouldn't. What natural selection tells us is that a horse will
220120	225440	always give birth to a horse that's very slightly different. After thousands of generations these
225440	231320	differences add up. If you want an example of imperceptible changes you once looked like this.
231320	236880	Maybe now you look something like this but you've probably looked in a mirror every day of your life.
236880	243280	So when did this change take place? Did you notice it? Okay let's accept that organisms do change
243280	248920	over time but how do we know they change into different species? A process known as speciation.
248920	254400	I'll leave the evidence of speciation for the next video and look at this through the example
254400	259680	of our hypotheticus. We've seen how it can grow taller over time in order to survive a change of
259680	265560	climate but there may be other ways of surviving. This hypotheticus for example may not be able to
265560	271520	compete well for leaves but because of its longer claws it can dig more easily for tubers so it would
271520	276880	have a better chance of survival and its genes would be passed on. The question is not whether
276920	282040	the hypotheticus would change over time but what could possibly stop these changes from happening.
282040	288760	Each generational change may be tiny but millions of years of accumulated change in a changing
288760	294560	environment leads to two completely different animals. The question is whether their DNA would
294560	299840	by then be so different that they could no longer breed. In the next video we'll see if there's any
299840	304720	physical evidence to give us the answer. Anti-evolutionists have other objections
304720	311720	which come up time and again. Well if you're imagining something like this then obviously
311720	317120	you can't but using our theory of natural selection and breaking it down into evolutionary
317120	323680	steps it's easy to understand. Simple organisms would have a sensory system like the amoeba which
323680	329040	can sense heat, cold and chemicals. This could then evolve into a sensory system with a central
329040	334960	processor just like in insects. Individuals with better organised centralised nervous systems would
334960	340640	be able to do more things and pass on this improved trait. The central processor would get
340640	347160	bigger and better. Again in stages. I won't spend time explaining the evolution of the eye here
347160	352320	because there are a number of good videos on YouTube that do that job including this one.
352320	360560	No, evolution requires variation. If information is a fancy way of saying bigger ears,
360560	367040	hairier bodies and longer necks then fine, we know that happens. We can see it. If information
367040	372560	means miraculously adding completely new parts then of course that doesn't happen and we know
372560	378680	why. In the next video I'll show the evidence that animals adapt existing morphology for new tasks.
378680	386000	Trying to characterise evolution as an accident doesn't change what it is or the evidence for it
386000	391480	and clearly there's nothing random about natural selection itself because genes survive only if
391480	397720	they're best suited to survive. Mutations are just the inevitable result of DNA that didn't make a
397720	403840	perfect copy and they're very common. The result is variation not some science fiction army of
403840	408960	mutant ninja turtles. In fact there's new evidence that mutations don't play such an
408960	413560	important role in natural selection and this might be a good time to look at what we've learned since
413560	419440	Darwin. At the time Darwin and Wallace published their paper on natural selection Louis Pasteur
419440	425600	was developing his pathogenic theory of medicine the idea that germs cause disease but it would be
425600	431040	laughable to presume that biologists haven't learned anything new about pathogens since 1860.
431040	436400	Of course our knowledge has advanced so why would our knowledge of evolution be any different?
436400	443160	Biologists now know that mutations may not be the big engine of change. DNA can be changed by
443160	450440	proteins which turn genes on and off a process known as cis regulation. Epigenetics is a huge
450440	456120	field but it drastically changes Darwin's premise that genes are just passively sitting there being
456120	461640	manipulated by environmental changes around them. Putting this very simply biologists have
461640	468120	discovered that DNA can exaggerate traits that are being naturally selected. Instead of being the slow
468120	473920	and steady change that Darwin envisaged evolution seems to happen in fits and starts. It's as if
473920	480440	natural selection is occasionally turbocharged. Cis regulation and epigenetics might explain why
480440	485920	this happens. These and many other discoveries don't overturn the 19th century idea of natural
486200	491000	selection any more than modern microbiology overturns the discoveries of Louis Pasteur
491000	497360	but they do show that Darwin's ideas were crude and incomplete. There's a lot more to the mechanism
497360	503200	that drives evolution yet to be uncovered. Okay so we've deduced from the comfort of our armchairs
503200	508800	that evolution ought to happen. At least I hope so. Now it's time to do the research and see if
508800	513160	these ideas are supported by physical evidence. Meet me in the next video.
