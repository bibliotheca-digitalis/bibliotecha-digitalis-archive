00:00.000 --> 00:07.000
The one thing we all know about the theory of evolution is that it was proposed by Charles

00:08.200 --> 00:15.200
Darwin about 150 years ago. Well, not quite. The idea that organisms evolved was floating

00:15.400 --> 00:20.880
around for 2000 years before Darwin and was revived a bit before his time by Jean-Baptiste

00:20.880 --> 00:25.760
Lamarck. But it didn't gain much ground because there was no obvious mechanism by which one

00:25.760 --> 00:30.440
type of animal could change into another. Lamarck suggested that maybe animals changed

00:30.440 --> 00:36.120
because they felt the need to change. It didn't sound very scientific and with no evidence

00:36.120 --> 00:42.380
to support it the idea didn't go very far. What Darwin did was to show a plausible mechanism

00:42.380 --> 00:47.320
by which these changes could happen and let's not forget poor old Alfred Wallace who came

00:47.320 --> 00:53.000
up with the same idea and published it jointly. The paper they wrote was this. Darwin had

00:53.000 --> 00:58.000
to come up with what he called the principle of natural selection. These days we tend to

00:58.000 --> 01:03.060
call this the theory of evolution as a kind of shorthand but that's confusing because

01:03.060 --> 01:08.680
we also use the term theory of evolution to describe the fact that organisms evolve. I

01:08.680 --> 01:12.920
want to leave the physical evidence and the proof of evolution for the next video. In

01:12.920 --> 01:18.100
this video I just want to look at the mechanism to see whether sitting in our armchairs and

01:18.100 --> 01:23.060
not doing a bit of research we can predict evolution in animals purely on the basis of

01:23.060 --> 01:29.220
what we know. That animals replicate themselves and that the replication isn't perfect. There's

01:29.220 --> 01:34.620
always variation. Just taking these two known facts and nothing else what do we expect might

01:34.620 --> 01:40.300
happen if we keep copying a hypothetical animal generation after generation in a changing

01:40.300 --> 01:45.920
environment. Let's say the hypotheticus lives in a tropical climate grazing happily on grass

01:45.920 --> 01:51.480
and plants. We know from our two principles that not every hypotheticus is the same. This

01:51.480 --> 01:56.400
one has been born with a slightly longer neck. This one has slightly longer legs. The third

01:56.400 --> 02:01.960
has slightly longer claws and the fourth has a slightly hairier body. Over time herds of

02:01.960 --> 02:07.920
hypotheticus spread across the continent but the climate changes and the continent dries up. Only

02:07.920 --> 02:13.680
scrubby bushes and hardy tubers can survive. The hypotheticus with the slightly longer neck can

02:13.680 --> 02:19.280
obviously get to more leaves than its neighbours. Inevitably taller and longer necked hypothetica

02:19.280 --> 02:25.120
are better fed and fitter and therefore reproduce more. A few generations later the drought has

02:25.120 --> 02:30.600
caused overall numbers to dwindle but there are more long-necked animals but natural selection

02:30.600 --> 02:35.520
doesn't suddenly stop just because average neck length has increased. The longest of the long

02:35.520 --> 02:41.680
necks now has an advantage over ordinary long necks and so the process continues. This principle

02:41.680 --> 02:47.200
is so easy to understand you have to wonder why it's so frequently misunderstood. So let's take

02:47.200 --> 02:56.680
this one step at a time and see where the confusion lies. Surely no argument there. By which I mean

02:56.680 --> 03:03.920
children are like their parents and inherit their traits. For example if it gets colder animals with

03:03.920 --> 03:10.840
hairier bodies will have a slightly better chance of survival. Pretty obvious? Like genes for hairy

03:10.840 --> 03:16.320
bodies. Genes that don't confer these advantages tend not to get passed on because the animals

03:16.320 --> 03:21.880
that carry them have a lower chance of survival. So if each of these steps is blindingly obvious

03:21.880 --> 03:28.760
then so is the conclusion. Over time animals should change. So why don't we see it? Why does

03:28.760 --> 03:35.000
a dog always give birth to a dog and a horse always gives birth to a horse? Well natural

03:35.000 --> 03:40.120
selection doesn't suggest they shouldn't. What natural selection tells us is that a horse will

03:40.120 --> 03:45.440
always give birth to a horse that's very slightly different. After thousands of generations these

03:45.440 --> 03:51.320
differences add up. If you want an example of imperceptible changes you once looked like this.

03:51.320 --> 03:56.880
Maybe now you look something like this but you've probably looked in a mirror every day of your life.

03:56.880 --> 04:03.280
So when did this change take place? Did you notice it? Okay let's accept that organisms do change

04:03.280 --> 04:08.920
over time but how do we know they change into different species? A process known as speciation.

04:08.920 --> 04:14.400
I'll leave the evidence of speciation for the next video and look at this through the example

04:14.400 --> 04:19.680
of our hypotheticus. We've seen how it can grow taller over time in order to survive a change of

04:19.680 --> 04:25.560
climate but there may be other ways of surviving. This hypotheticus for example may not be able to

04:25.560 --> 04:31.520
compete well for leaves but because of its longer claws it can dig more easily for tubers so it would

04:31.520 --> 04:36.880
have a better chance of survival and its genes would be passed on. The question is not whether

04:36.920 --> 04:42.040
the hypotheticus would change over time but what could possibly stop these changes from happening.

04:42.040 --> 04:48.760
Each generational change may be tiny but millions of years of accumulated change in a changing

04:48.760 --> 04:54.560
environment leads to two completely different animals. The question is whether their DNA would

04:54.560 --> 04:59.840
by then be so different that they could no longer breed. In the next video we'll see if there's any

04:59.840 --> 05:04.720
physical evidence to give us the answer. Anti-evolutionists have other objections

05:04.720 --> 05:11.720
which come up time and again. Well if you're imagining something like this then obviously

05:11.720 --> 05:17.120
you can't but using our theory of natural selection and breaking it down into evolutionary

05:17.120 --> 05:23.680
steps it's easy to understand. Simple organisms would have a sensory system like the amoeba which

05:23.680 --> 05:29.040
can sense heat, cold and chemicals. This could then evolve into a sensory system with a central

05:29.040 --> 05:34.960
processor just like in insects. Individuals with better organised centralised nervous systems would

05:34.960 --> 05:40.640
be able to do more things and pass on this improved trait. The central processor would get

05:40.640 --> 05:47.160
bigger and better. Again in stages. I won't spend time explaining the evolution of the eye here

05:47.160 --> 05:52.320
because there are a number of good videos on YouTube that do that job including this one.

05:52.320 --> 06:00.560
No, evolution requires variation. If information is a fancy way of saying bigger ears,

06:00.560 --> 06:07.040
hairier bodies and longer necks then fine, we know that happens. We can see it. If information

06:07.040 --> 06:12.560
means miraculously adding completely new parts then of course that doesn't happen and we know

06:12.560 --> 06:18.680
why. In the next video I'll show the evidence that animals adapt existing morphology for new tasks.

06:18.680 --> 06:26.000
Trying to characterise evolution as an accident doesn't change what it is or the evidence for it

06:26.000 --> 06:31.480
and clearly there's nothing random about natural selection itself because genes survive only if

06:31.480 --> 06:37.720
they're best suited to survive. Mutations are just the inevitable result of DNA that didn't make a

06:37.720 --> 06:43.840
perfect copy and they're very common. The result is variation not some science fiction army of

06:43.840 --> 06:48.960
mutant ninja turtles. In fact there's new evidence that mutations don't play such an

06:48.960 --> 06:53.560
important role in natural selection and this might be a good time to look at what we've learned since

06:53.560 --> 06:59.440
Darwin. At the time Darwin and Wallace published their paper on natural selection Louis Pasteur

06:59.440 --> 07:05.600
was developing his pathogenic theory of medicine the idea that germs cause disease but it would be

07:05.600 --> 07:11.040
laughable to presume that biologists haven't learned anything new about pathogens since 1860.

07:11.040 --> 07:16.400
Of course our knowledge has advanced so why would our knowledge of evolution be any different?

07:16.400 --> 07:23.160
Biologists now know that mutations may not be the big engine of change. DNA can be changed by

07:23.160 --> 07:30.440
proteins which turn genes on and off a process known as cis regulation. Epigenetics is a huge

07:30.440 --> 07:36.120
field but it drastically changes Darwin's premise that genes are just passively sitting there being

07:36.120 --> 07:41.640
manipulated by environmental changes around them. Putting this very simply biologists have

07:41.640 --> 07:48.120
discovered that DNA can exaggerate traits that are being naturally selected. Instead of being the slow

07:48.120 --> 07:53.920
and steady change that Darwin envisaged evolution seems to happen in fits and starts. It's as if

07:53.920 --> 08:00.440
natural selection is occasionally turbocharged. Cis regulation and epigenetics might explain why

08:00.440 --> 08:05.920
this happens. These and many other discoveries don't overturn the 19th century idea of natural

08:06.200 --> 08:11.000
selection any more than modern microbiology overturns the discoveries of Louis Pasteur

08:11.000 --> 08:17.360
but they do show that Darwin's ideas were crude and incomplete. There's a lot more to the mechanism

08:17.360 --> 08:23.200
that drives evolution yet to be uncovered. Okay so we've deduced from the comfort of our armchairs

08:23.200 --> 08:28.800
that evolution ought to happen. At least I hope so. Now it's time to do the research and see if

08:28.800 --> 08:33.160
these ideas are supported by physical evidence. Meet me in the next video.

08:35.920 --> 08:36.000
