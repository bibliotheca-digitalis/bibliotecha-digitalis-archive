00:00.000 --> 00:02.000
Thank you.

00:30.000 --> 00:40.000
Hi YouTube. I've just got an idea which has just come to me literally from a few minutes

00:40.000 --> 00:48.000
ago from an atheist who was writing a comment on one of my videos and it just inspired me

00:48.000 --> 00:52.000
with quite a good idea. I haven't thought it through yet but I'm pretty sure this is

00:52.000 --> 00:58.000
one of the best I've come up with completely 100% originally which I haven't thought of before.

00:58.000 --> 01:02.000
It's an idea that's just come to you in the last few minutes that you haven't thought

01:02.000 --> 01:06.000
through yet but that you think will overturn one of the most solid theories in science

01:06.000 --> 01:12.000
back by over a century of overwhelming evidence. Well, what could possibly go wrong?

01:12.000 --> 01:18.000
I want you to go straight back to the very, very, very beginning with the primordial soup

01:18.000 --> 01:24.000
that we supposedly come from and whatever it was, I think they say a bolt of lightning

01:24.000 --> 01:31.000
some kind of electrical charge makes amino acids come together and form, we'll say, the

01:31.000 --> 01:37.000
first cell. This one single cell is the only living organism on Earth and this has come

01:37.000 --> 01:42.000
from the primordial soup from which everything else in the whole time is going to evolve

01:42.000 --> 01:46.000
from according to evolution. Now the problem is that...

01:46.000 --> 01:50.000
Wait, before you go on to tell us what the problem is, let me suggest to you what the

01:50.000 --> 01:55.000
problem is. The problem is you haven't bothered to find out what researchers have discovered

01:55.000 --> 02:00.000
about the origin of life on Earth or what their postulating might have happened. You've

02:00.000 --> 02:05.000
made a few wild guesses and now you intend to show that your best guess is simply not

02:05.000 --> 02:10.000
plausible. Well done! So here are the other problems. First, amino

02:10.000 --> 02:16.000
acids didn't come together to form the first cell. Life didn't even begin with the first

02:16.000 --> 02:21.000
cell, it probably began with a nucleic acid that could replicate itself. It could have

02:21.000 --> 02:25.000
taken millions of years before some of these nucleic acids evolved to the stage where they

02:25.000 --> 02:30.000
entered clumps of lipids. Better protected inside a lipid membrane, they had a higher

02:30.000 --> 02:35.000
chance of survival and passed on this affinity when they copied themselves. Of course, researchers

02:35.000 --> 02:41.000
may be wrong about all this, but if so, put up an argument against it. Show why they're

02:41.000 --> 02:46.000
wrong and show which stage of the chemistry is impossible. What you can't do is make

02:46.000 --> 02:51.000
up some nonsense about a bolt of lightning making the first cell in a primordial soup

02:51.000 --> 02:56.000
and then go on to show that this made up nonsense is made up nonsense.

02:56.000 --> 03:00.000
You know, nothing's easier to debunk than creationists who spend all their time and

03:00.000 --> 03:05.000
effort attacking theories and hypotheses that don't exist. And that's why a lot of them

03:05.000 --> 03:10.000
end up as nominees for the coveted Golden Crocoduck. So in this video I'm putting

03:10.000 --> 03:15.000
a few third-rate nominees together who have one thing in common with Perficitous. They

03:15.000 --> 03:21.000
all base their arguments on a complete misunderstanding of what science says.

03:21.000 --> 03:25.000
Putting up an argument that's never been made and then tearing it to shreds is called

03:25.000 --> 03:29.000
a straw man. And of course, if you build the straw man yourself and dress it up in all

03:29.000 --> 03:33.000
sorts of nonsense, then it's very easy to tear apart.

03:33.000 --> 03:39.000
Evolution, it's the greatest lie, hands down, ever hoisted upon mankind.

03:39.000 --> 03:43.000
The second law of thermodynamics contradicts the very premise of evolution.

03:43.000 --> 03:47.000
Ooh, tell us, what is this second law of thermodynamics of which you speak?

03:47.000 --> 03:51.000
The second law says that the whole universe is running down into complete disorder.

03:51.000 --> 03:56.000
Well, this wasn't the second law of thermodynamics as I was taught it, but maybe it's changed

03:56.000 --> 04:01.000
since I went to school. So I googled the atheist antidote's definition of the second law

04:01.000 --> 04:06.000
to find out where he'd got it from. No prizes for guessing, the definition comes from an

04:06.000 --> 04:11.000
article by a creationist, Henry Morris, on a creationist website.

04:11.000 --> 04:15.000
Let's read the relevant extract from Morris's article.

04:15.000 --> 04:20.000
The evolutionist assumes that the whole universe has evolved upward from a single primeval

04:20.000 --> 04:24.000
particle to human beings. Shh, I'm trying to read.

04:24.000 --> 04:29.000
But the second law, one of the best proved laws of science, says that...

04:29.000 --> 04:35.000
Wait a minute. The atheist antidote, in your video, did you simply repeat what someone

04:35.000 --> 04:37.000
else wrote on a website?

04:37.000 --> 04:41.000
The evolutionist, he assumes that the whole universe has evolved upward from a single

04:41.000 --> 04:45.000
particle to the present state of human beings. But again, the second law of thermodynamics,

04:45.000 --> 04:52.000
one of the most solidly proven, best tested laws in science, says the atheist has everything

04:52.000 --> 04:55.000
but backwards, which wouldn't be the first time for y'all, would it?

04:55.000 --> 05:00.000
The second law says that the whole universe is running down into complete disorder.

05:00.000 --> 05:05.000
Yes, apparently you did. You've embellished it with a few choice words of your own.

05:05.000 --> 05:10.000
But essentially, your rant is just copied from Morris and passed off as your own work.

05:10.000 --> 05:15.000
Not only that, but in repeating what another creationist wrote without bothering to check it,

05:15.000 --> 05:20.000
you get the definition of the second law of thermodynamics completely wrong.

05:20.000 --> 05:25.000
Now, there really is no definitive version of the second law, so wording does vary.

05:25.000 --> 05:31.000
But no one, apart from creationists, has ever defined the second law as the whole universe

05:31.000 --> 05:33.000
running down into complete disorder.

05:33.000 --> 05:37.000
After all, we only need to look around us to see that that isn't the case.

05:37.000 --> 05:42.000
Plant a sunflower seed and it grows into a flower that can turn to face the sun.

05:42.000 --> 05:50.000
When water evaporates and rises haphazardly into the atmosphere, it turns into exquisitely ordered snowflakes.

05:50.000 --> 05:57.000
Volcanic explosions, the very definition of chaos and disorder, can produce beautiful crystal geodes.

05:57.000 --> 06:01.000
So given that we can see this happening all around us all the time,

06:01.000 --> 06:06.000
who in their right minds would devise a law that says none of this is happening?

06:06.000 --> 06:12.000
And why in a hundred years of science hasn't anyone spotted that the law doesn't conform to reality?

06:12.000 --> 06:17.000
The answer is either that scientists are all stupid or that the atheist antidote,

06:17.000 --> 06:21.000
copying straight from Henry Morris, got the definition wrong.

06:21.000 --> 06:26.000
In fact, reality complies very nicely with the second law of thermodynamics,

06:26.000 --> 06:31.000
which says there's a tendency towards disorder in a closed system.

06:31.000 --> 06:35.000
And evolution complies very nicely also, on two counts.

06:35.000 --> 06:39.000
First, there is a tendency towards disorder in the universe,

06:39.000 --> 06:45.000
because the brief period life exists on Earth before our planet is consumed by an expanding and dying sun

06:45.000 --> 06:48.000
won't affect that tendency towards disorder at all.

06:48.000 --> 06:53.000
Secondly, the Earth receives energy from the sun, so it isn't a closed system.

06:53.000 --> 06:58.000
What evolution that Charles Darwin was talking about...

06:58.000 --> 07:01.000
In fact, Charles Darwin very carefully avoided the word.

07:01.000 --> 07:04.000
He used the word transmutation of species in his book.

07:04.000 --> 07:06.000
Here's our third straw man.

07:06.000 --> 07:14.000
Now, I hope you all realise that the theory of evolution does not say dogs turn into cats and fish turn into birds.

07:14.000 --> 07:21.000
Now, transmutation of species means dogs turning into cats, fish turning into birds, cows turning into whales.

07:21.000 --> 07:25.000
And that doesn't happen.

07:25.000 --> 07:29.000
No, whether you call it transmutation of species or evolution,

07:29.000 --> 07:33.000
you don't get dogs turning into cats or fish turning into birds.

07:33.000 --> 07:36.000
No, cows don't turn into whales either.

07:36.000 --> 07:40.000
That would be like, I don't know, water turning into wine.

07:41.000 --> 07:46.000
What you do get is the evolution of animal species over thousands of generations.

07:46.000 --> 07:50.000
A fish won't turn into a bird any more than it'll give birth to a bird,

07:50.000 --> 07:56.000
but each new generation of a particular species will be slightly different to the previous generation.

07:56.000 --> 08:01.000
Look, you've got a few books there to make it look as though you know what you're talking about.

08:01.000 --> 08:05.000
Why doesn't at least one of them cover the basics of evolutionary theory?

08:05.000 --> 08:08.000
Life happened once.

08:08.000 --> 08:12.000
And when life happened once, there was a cell.

08:12.000 --> 08:15.000
And from that cell, everything is descended.

08:15.000 --> 08:18.000
That means that you are personally related to a banana.

08:18.000 --> 08:19.000
Yes, you could certainly say that.

08:19.000 --> 08:21.000
It means you're related to a cabbage.

08:21.000 --> 08:22.000
Also correct.

08:22.000 --> 08:23.000
It means you're related to a bacteria and camel.

08:23.000 --> 08:24.000
So what?

08:24.000 --> 08:25.000
And a bacterium.

08:25.000 --> 08:26.000
What's your point?

08:26.000 --> 08:30.000
I mean, you don't need to be a rocket scientist.

08:30.000 --> 08:33.000
I may have studied this subject for years and years and years and years.

08:33.000 --> 08:34.000
What's your point?

08:34.000 --> 08:42.000
But the actual things that knock down evolution as a theory are so simple.

08:42.000 --> 08:43.000
Then what are they?

08:43.000 --> 08:49.000
You see, one of the main rules of science has got a very complicated name.

08:49.000 --> 08:51.000
It's called the law of thermodynamics.

08:51.000 --> 08:53.000
Oh, OK. This is where we came in.

08:53.000 --> 08:59.000
So to summarise your main argument, if evolution is true, then we all evolve from simple bacteria,

08:59.000 --> 09:06.000
so all life on Earth is related, and this is not possible because of...

09:06.000 --> 09:09.000
And then the argument goes on, you don't have to be a rocket scientist,

09:09.000 --> 09:13.000
and the thing is, the law of thermodynamics.

09:13.000 --> 09:17.000
But before I wind up this year's nominees for the 2011 Golden Crocoduck,

09:17.000 --> 09:20.000
I just have one more to add.

09:20.000 --> 09:23.000
John Pendleton has been nominated a couple of times before,

09:23.000 --> 09:26.000
and someone nominated him again for this video.

09:26.000 --> 09:31.000
I didn't think anything of it until I came to this breathtaking breach of the 9th Commandment

09:31.000 --> 09:33.000
that left me just speechless.

09:33.000 --> 09:37.000
Now, Loch Ness is located in Scotland, England.

09:37.000 --> 09:42.000
Sorry, but as someone who's descended from both Anglo-Saxons and Scottish Highlanders,

09:42.000 --> 09:48.000
I find this appalling on... on so many levels, I...

09:48.000 --> 09:52.000
That's right, Mike, I couldn't have said it better myself.

09:52.000 --> 09:58.000
Sadly, this particular breach of the 9th Commandment isn't so much to further the creationist cause

09:58.000 --> 10:04.000
as the cause of geographical ignorance, so it doesn't qualify for a coveted Golden Crocoduck.

10:04.000 --> 10:09.000
But Professors, the atheist antidote, and Mike's story are all contenders.
