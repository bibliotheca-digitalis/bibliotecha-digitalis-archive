00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Thank you.

2
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:40,000
Hi YouTube. I've just got an idea which has just come to me literally from a few minutes

3
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:48,000
ago from an atheist who was writing a comment on one of my videos and it just inspired me

4
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:52,000
with quite a good idea. I haven't thought it through yet but I'm pretty sure this is

5
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:58,000
one of the best I've come up with completely 100% originally which I haven't thought of before.

6
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:02,000
It's an idea that's just come to you in the last few minutes that you haven't thought

7
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:06,000
through yet but that you think will overturn one of the most solid theories in science

8
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:12,000
back by over a century of overwhelming evidence. Well, what could possibly go wrong?

9
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:18,000
I want you to go straight back to the very, very, very beginning with the primordial soup

10
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:24,000
that we supposedly come from and whatever it was, I think they say a bolt of lightning

11
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:31,000
some kind of electrical charge makes amino acids come together and form, we'll say, the

12
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:37,000
first cell. This one single cell is the only living organism on Earth and this has come

13
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:42,000
from the primordial soup from which everything else in the whole time is going to evolve

14
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:46,000
from according to evolution. Now the problem is that...

15
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:50,000
Wait, before you go on to tell us what the problem is, let me suggest to you what the

16
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:55,000
problem is. The problem is you haven't bothered to find out what researchers have discovered

17
00:01:55,000 --> 00:02:00,000
about the origin of life on Earth or what their postulating might have happened. You've

18
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:05,000
made a few wild guesses and now you intend to show that your best guess is simply not

19
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:10,000
plausible. Well done! So here are the other problems. First, amino

20
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:16,000
acids didn't come together to form the first cell. Life didn't even begin with the first

21
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:21,000
cell, it probably began with a nucleic acid that could replicate itself. It could have

22
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:25,000
taken millions of years before some of these nucleic acids evolved to the stage where they

23
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:30,000
entered clumps of lipids. Better protected inside a lipid membrane, they had a higher

24
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:35,000
chance of survival and passed on this affinity when they copied themselves. Of course, researchers

25
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:41,000
may be wrong about all this, but if so, put up an argument against it. Show why they're

26
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:46,000
wrong and show which stage of the chemistry is impossible. What you can't do is make

27
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:51,000
up some nonsense about a bolt of lightning making the first cell in a primordial soup

28
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:56,000
and then go on to show that this made up nonsense is made up nonsense.

29
00:02:56,000 --> 00:03:00,000
You know, nothing's easier to debunk than creationists who spend all their time and

30
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:05,000
effort attacking theories and hypotheses that don't exist. And that's why a lot of them

31
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:10,000
end up as nominees for the coveted Golden Crocoduck. So in this video I'm putting

32
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:15,000
a few third-rate nominees together who have one thing in common with Perficitous. They

33
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:21,000
all base their arguments on a complete misunderstanding of what science says.

34
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:25,000
Putting up an argument that's never been made and then tearing it to shreds is called

35
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:29,000
a straw man. And of course, if you build the straw man yourself and dress it up in all

36
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:33,000
sorts of nonsense, then it's very easy to tear apart.

37
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:39,000
Evolution, it's the greatest lie, hands down, ever hoisted upon mankind.

38
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:43,000
The second law of thermodynamics contradicts the very premise of evolution.

39
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:47,000
Ooh, tell us, what is this second law of thermodynamics of which you speak?

40
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:51,000
The second law says that the whole universe is running down into complete disorder.

41
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:56,000
Well, this wasn't the second law of thermodynamics as I was taught it, but maybe it's changed

42
00:03:56,000 --> 00:04:01,000
since I went to school. So I googled the atheist antidote's definition of the second law

43
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:06,000
to find out where he'd got it from. No prizes for guessing, the definition comes from an

44
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:11,000
article by a creationist, Henry Morris, on a creationist website.

45
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:15,000
Let's read the relevant extract from Morris's article.

46
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:20,000
The evolutionist assumes that the whole universe has evolved upward from a single primeval

47
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:24,000
particle to human beings. Shh, I'm trying to read.

48
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:29,000
But the second law, one of the best proved laws of science, says that...

49
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:35,000
Wait a minute. The atheist antidote, in your video, did you simply repeat what someone

50
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:37,000
else wrote on a website?

51
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:41,000
The evolutionist, he assumes that the whole universe has evolved upward from a single

52
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:45,000
particle to the present state of human beings. But again, the second law of thermodynamics,

53
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:52,000
one of the most solidly proven, best tested laws in science, says the atheist has everything

54
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:55,000
but backwards, which wouldn't be the first time for y'all, would it?

55
00:04:55,000 --> 00:05:00,000
The second law says that the whole universe is running down into complete disorder.

56
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:05,000
Yes, apparently you did. You've embellished it with a few choice words of your own.

57
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:10,000
But essentially, your rant is just copied from Morris and passed off as your own work.

58
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:15,000
Not only that, but in repeating what another creationist wrote without bothering to check it,

59
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:20,000
you get the definition of the second law of thermodynamics completely wrong.

60
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:25,000
Now, there really is no definitive version of the second law, so wording does vary.

61
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:31,000
But no one, apart from creationists, has ever defined the second law as the whole universe

62
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:33,000
running down into complete disorder.

63
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:37,000
After all, we only need to look around us to see that that isn't the case.

64
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:42,000
Plant a sunflower seed and it grows into a flower that can turn to face the sun.

65
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:50,000
When water evaporates and rises haphazardly into the atmosphere, it turns into exquisitely ordered snowflakes.

66
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:57,000
Volcanic explosions, the very definition of chaos and disorder, can produce beautiful crystal geodes.

67
00:05:57,000 --> 00:06:01,000
So given that we can see this happening all around us all the time,

68
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:06,000
who in their right minds would devise a law that says none of this is happening?

69
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:12,000
And why in a hundred years of science hasn't anyone spotted that the law doesn't conform to reality?

70
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:17,000
The answer is either that scientists are all stupid or that the atheist antidote,

71
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:21,000
copying straight from Henry Morris, got the definition wrong.

72
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:26,000
In fact, reality complies very nicely with the second law of thermodynamics,

73
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:31,000
which says there's a tendency towards disorder in a closed system.

74
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:35,000
And evolution complies very nicely also, on two counts.

75
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:39,000
First, there is a tendency towards disorder in the universe,

76
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:45,000
because the brief period life exists on Earth before our planet is consumed by an expanding and dying sun

77
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:48,000
won't affect that tendency towards disorder at all.

78
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:53,000
Secondly, the Earth receives energy from the sun, so it isn't a closed system.

79
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:58,000
What evolution that Charles Darwin was talking about...

80
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:01,000
In fact, Charles Darwin very carefully avoided the word.

81
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:04,000
He used the word transmutation of species in his book.

82
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:06,000
Here's our third straw man.

83
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:14,000
Now, I hope you all realise that the theory of evolution does not say dogs turn into cats and fish turn into birds.

84
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:21,000
Now, transmutation of species means dogs turning into cats, fish turning into birds, cows turning into whales.

85
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:25,000
And that doesn't happen.

86
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:29,000
No, whether you call it transmutation of species or evolution,

87
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:33,000
you don't get dogs turning into cats or fish turning into birds.

88
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:36,000
No, cows don't turn into whales either.

89
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:40,000
That would be like, I don't know, water turning into wine.

90
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:46,000
What you do get is the evolution of animal species over thousands of generations.

91
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:50,000
A fish won't turn into a bird any more than it'll give birth to a bird,

92
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:56,000
but each new generation of a particular species will be slightly different to the previous generation.

93
00:07:56,000 --> 00:08:01,000
Look, you've got a few books there to make it look as though you know what you're talking about.

94
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:05,000
Why doesn't at least one of them cover the basics of evolutionary theory?

95
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:08,000
Life happened once.

96
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:12,000
And when life happened once, there was a cell.

97
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:15,000
And from that cell, everything is descended.

98
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:18,000
That means that you are personally related to a banana.

99
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:19,000
Yes, you could certainly say that.

100
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:21,000
It means you're related to a cabbage.

101
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:22,000
Also correct.

102
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:23,000
It means you're related to a bacteria and camel.

103
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:24,000
So what?

104
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:25,000
And a bacterium.

105
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:26,000
What's your point?

106
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:30,000
I mean, you don't need to be a rocket scientist.

107
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:33,000
I may have studied this subject for years and years and years and years.

108
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:34,000
What's your point?

109
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:42,000
But the actual things that knock down evolution as a theory are so simple.

110
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:43,000
Then what are they?

111
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:49,000
You see, one of the main rules of science has got a very complicated name.

112
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:51,000
It's called the law of thermodynamics.

113
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:53,000
Oh, OK. This is where we came in.

114
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:59,000
So to summarise your main argument, if evolution is true, then we all evolve from simple bacteria,

115
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:06,000
so all life on Earth is related, and this is not possible because of...

116
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:09,000
And then the argument goes on, you don't have to be a rocket scientist,

117
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:13,000
and the thing is, the law of thermodynamics.

118
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:17,000
But before I wind up this year's nominees for the 2011 Golden Crocoduck,

119
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:20,000
I just have one more to add.

120
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:23,000
John Pendleton has been nominated a couple of times before,

121
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:26,000
and someone nominated him again for this video.

122
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:31,000
I didn't think anything of it until I came to this breathtaking breach of the 9th Commandment

123
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:33,000
that left me just speechless.

124
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:37,000
Now, Loch Ness is located in Scotland, England.

125
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:42,000
Sorry, but as someone who's descended from both Anglo-Saxons and Scottish Highlanders,

126
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:48,000
I find this appalling on... on so many levels, I...

127
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:52,000
That's right, Mike, I couldn't have said it better myself.

128
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:58,000
Sadly, this particular breach of the 9th Commandment isn't so much to further the creationist cause

129
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:04,000
as the cause of geographical ignorance, so it doesn't qualify for a coveted Golden Crocoduck.

130
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:09,000
But Professors, the atheist antidote, and Mike's story are all contenders.
