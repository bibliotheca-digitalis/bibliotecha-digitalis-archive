0	2000	Thank you.
30000	40000	Hi YouTube. I've just got an idea which has just come to me literally from a few minutes
40000	48000	ago from an atheist who was writing a comment on one of my videos and it just inspired me
48000	52000	with quite a good idea. I haven't thought it through yet but I'm pretty sure this is
52000	58000	one of the best I've come up with completely 100% originally which I haven't thought of before.
58000	62000	It's an idea that's just come to you in the last few minutes that you haven't thought
62000	66000	through yet but that you think will overturn one of the most solid theories in science
66000	72000	back by over a century of overwhelming evidence. Well, what could possibly go wrong?
72000	78000	I want you to go straight back to the very, very, very beginning with the primordial soup
78000	84000	that we supposedly come from and whatever it was, I think they say a bolt of lightning
84000	91000	some kind of electrical charge makes amino acids come together and form, we'll say, the
91000	97000	first cell. This one single cell is the only living organism on Earth and this has come
97000	102000	from the primordial soup from which everything else in the whole time is going to evolve
102000	106000	from according to evolution. Now the problem is that...
106000	110000	Wait, before you go on to tell us what the problem is, let me suggest to you what the
110000	115000	problem is. The problem is you haven't bothered to find out what researchers have discovered
115000	120000	about the origin of life on Earth or what their postulating might have happened. You've
120000	125000	made a few wild guesses and now you intend to show that your best guess is simply not
125000	130000	plausible. Well done! So here are the other problems. First, amino
130000	136000	acids didn't come together to form the first cell. Life didn't even begin with the first
136000	141000	cell, it probably began with a nucleic acid that could replicate itself. It could have
141000	145000	taken millions of years before some of these nucleic acids evolved to the stage where they
145000	150000	entered clumps of lipids. Better protected inside a lipid membrane, they had a higher
150000	155000	chance of survival and passed on this affinity when they copied themselves. Of course, researchers
155000	161000	may be wrong about all this, but if so, put up an argument against it. Show why they're
161000	166000	wrong and show which stage of the chemistry is impossible. What you can't do is make
166000	171000	up some nonsense about a bolt of lightning making the first cell in a primordial soup
171000	176000	and then go on to show that this made up nonsense is made up nonsense.
176000	180000	You know, nothing's easier to debunk than creationists who spend all their time and
180000	185000	effort attacking theories and hypotheses that don't exist. And that's why a lot of them
185000	190000	end up as nominees for the coveted Golden Crocoduck. So in this video I'm putting
190000	195000	a few third-rate nominees together who have one thing in common with Perficitous. They
195000	201000	all base their arguments on a complete misunderstanding of what science says.
201000	205000	Putting up an argument that's never been made and then tearing it to shreds is called
205000	209000	a straw man. And of course, if you build the straw man yourself and dress it up in all
209000	213000	sorts of nonsense, then it's very easy to tear apart.
213000	219000	Evolution, it's the greatest lie, hands down, ever hoisted upon mankind.
219000	223000	The second law of thermodynamics contradicts the very premise of evolution.
223000	227000	Ooh, tell us, what is this second law of thermodynamics of which you speak?
227000	231000	The second law says that the whole universe is running down into complete disorder.
231000	236000	Well, this wasn't the second law of thermodynamics as I was taught it, but maybe it's changed
236000	241000	since I went to school. So I googled the atheist antidote's definition of the second law
241000	246000	to find out where he'd got it from. No prizes for guessing, the definition comes from an
246000	251000	article by a creationist, Henry Morris, on a creationist website.
251000	255000	Let's read the relevant extract from Morris's article.
255000	260000	The evolutionist assumes that the whole universe has evolved upward from a single primeval
260000	264000	particle to human beings. Shh, I'm trying to read.
264000	269000	But the second law, one of the best proved laws of science, says that...
269000	275000	Wait a minute. The atheist antidote, in your video, did you simply repeat what someone
275000	277000	else wrote on a website?
277000	281000	The evolutionist, he assumes that the whole universe has evolved upward from a single
281000	285000	particle to the present state of human beings. But again, the second law of thermodynamics,
285000	292000	one of the most solidly proven, best tested laws in science, says the atheist has everything
292000	295000	but backwards, which wouldn't be the first time for y'all, would it?
295000	300000	The second law says that the whole universe is running down into complete disorder.
300000	305000	Yes, apparently you did. You've embellished it with a few choice words of your own.
305000	310000	But essentially, your rant is just copied from Morris and passed off as your own work.
310000	315000	Not only that, but in repeating what another creationist wrote without bothering to check it,
315000	320000	you get the definition of the second law of thermodynamics completely wrong.
320000	325000	Now, there really is no definitive version of the second law, so wording does vary.
325000	331000	But no one, apart from creationists, has ever defined the second law as the whole universe
331000	333000	running down into complete disorder.
333000	337000	After all, we only need to look around us to see that that isn't the case.
337000	342000	Plant a sunflower seed and it grows into a flower that can turn to face the sun.
342000	350000	When water evaporates and rises haphazardly into the atmosphere, it turns into exquisitely ordered snowflakes.
350000	357000	Volcanic explosions, the very definition of chaos and disorder, can produce beautiful crystal geodes.
357000	361000	So given that we can see this happening all around us all the time,
361000	366000	who in their right minds would devise a law that says none of this is happening?
366000	372000	And why in a hundred years of science hasn't anyone spotted that the law doesn't conform to reality?
372000	377000	The answer is either that scientists are all stupid or that the atheist antidote,
377000	381000	copying straight from Henry Morris, got the definition wrong.
381000	386000	In fact, reality complies very nicely with the second law of thermodynamics,
386000	391000	which says there's a tendency towards disorder in a closed system.
391000	395000	And evolution complies very nicely also, on two counts.
395000	399000	First, there is a tendency towards disorder in the universe,
399000	405000	because the brief period life exists on Earth before our planet is consumed by an expanding and dying sun
405000	408000	won't affect that tendency towards disorder at all.
408000	413000	Secondly, the Earth receives energy from the sun, so it isn't a closed system.
413000	418000	What evolution that Charles Darwin was talking about...
418000	421000	In fact, Charles Darwin very carefully avoided the word.
421000	424000	He used the word transmutation of species in his book.
424000	426000	Here's our third straw man.
426000	434000	Now, I hope you all realise that the theory of evolution does not say dogs turn into cats and fish turn into birds.
434000	441000	Now, transmutation of species means dogs turning into cats, fish turning into birds, cows turning into whales.
441000	445000	And that doesn't happen.
445000	449000	No, whether you call it transmutation of species or evolution,
449000	453000	you don't get dogs turning into cats or fish turning into birds.
453000	456000	No, cows don't turn into whales either.
456000	460000	That would be like, I don't know, water turning into wine.
461000	466000	What you do get is the evolution of animal species over thousands of generations.
466000	470000	A fish won't turn into a bird any more than it'll give birth to a bird,
470000	476000	but each new generation of a particular species will be slightly different to the previous generation.
476000	481000	Look, you've got a few books there to make it look as though you know what you're talking about.
481000	485000	Why doesn't at least one of them cover the basics of evolutionary theory?
485000	488000	Life happened once.
488000	492000	And when life happened once, there was a cell.
492000	495000	And from that cell, everything is descended.
495000	498000	That means that you are personally related to a banana.
498000	499000	Yes, you could certainly say that.
499000	501000	It means you're related to a cabbage.
501000	502000	Also correct.
502000	503000	It means you're related to a bacteria and camel.
503000	504000	So what?
504000	505000	And a bacterium.
505000	506000	What's your point?
506000	510000	I mean, you don't need to be a rocket scientist.
510000	513000	I may have studied this subject for years and years and years and years.
513000	514000	What's your point?
514000	522000	But the actual things that knock down evolution as a theory are so simple.
522000	523000	Then what are they?
523000	529000	You see, one of the main rules of science has got a very complicated name.
529000	531000	It's called the law of thermodynamics.
531000	533000	Oh, OK. This is where we came in.
533000	539000	So to summarise your main argument, if evolution is true, then we all evolve from simple bacteria,
539000	546000	so all life on Earth is related, and this is not possible because of...
546000	549000	And then the argument goes on, you don't have to be a rocket scientist,
549000	553000	and the thing is, the law of thermodynamics.
553000	557000	But before I wind up this year's nominees for the 2011 Golden Crocoduck,
557000	560000	I just have one more to add.
560000	563000	John Pendleton has been nominated a couple of times before,
563000	566000	and someone nominated him again for this video.
566000	571000	I didn't think anything of it until I came to this breathtaking breach of the 9th Commandment
571000	573000	that left me just speechless.
573000	577000	Now, Loch Ness is located in Scotland, England.
577000	582000	Sorry, but as someone who's descended from both Anglo-Saxons and Scottish Highlanders,
582000	588000	I find this appalling on... on so many levels, I...
588000	592000	That's right, Mike, I couldn't have said it better myself.
592000	598000	Sadly, this particular breach of the 9th Commandment isn't so much to further the creationist cause
598000	604000	as the cause of geographical ignorance, so it doesn't qualify for a coveted Golden Crocoduck.
604000	609000	But Professors, the atheist antidote, and Mike's story are all contenders.
