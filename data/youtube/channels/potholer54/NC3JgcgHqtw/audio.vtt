00:00.000 --> 00:07.000
Welcome to the fourth annual Golden Crocoduck Award.

00:10.600 --> 00:15.880
Thank you, thank you ladies and gentlemen. Oh, you're too kind. And my thanks to St Jude

00:15.880 --> 00:21.160
Thaddeus, the patron saint of lost causes, for hosting this glittering event.

00:21.160 --> 00:25.240
Well it's been an exciting day. All the stars have been gathering for the award ceremony

00:25.240 --> 00:29.920
here at St Jude's Theatre. There's the Pope arriving, sharing an intimate moment with

00:29.920 --> 00:36.080
St Jude himself. And could it be? Yes, even Kent Hogan has arrived to watch the show,

00:36.080 --> 00:41.400
of course coming in the back way. As you know, his son is one of the contenders for a coveted

00:41.400 --> 00:45.980
Golden Crocoduck this year, awarded for the biggest breach of the ninth commandment in

00:45.980 --> 00:50.700
pursuit of the creationist cause. And they're all in for a real treat, because it's been

00:50.700 --> 00:55.560
an exciting and closely fought contest this year. There was a lively debate on the voting

00:55.560 --> 01:00.760
video forum, and as voting proceeded, it soon became clear that we had no obvious front

01:00.760 --> 01:06.380
runner. Two of the contestants were running neck and neck. So let's announce the results

01:06.380 --> 01:13.380
in time-honoured Golden Crocoduck tradition by starting from the back of the field.

01:50.700 --> 01:57.700
Yes, we now come to the top two. As I said, the number of votes they were receiving throughout

02:05.920 --> 02:11.320
the count were very close. It was a kind of Dewey vs Truman moment, because I started

02:11.320 --> 02:18.320
to prepare videos on both of them. And the final vote tally was a nail-biting 1,278 votes

02:18.440 --> 02:25.440
against 1,209. So who had the highest score? Well, let's introduce him with his own immortal

02:26.360 --> 02:33.360
catchphrase. I should have listened to my daily.

02:48.320 --> 02:55.320
Yes, Eric Hovind, the rascal, showed that he's a chip off the old block and just managed

02:57.280 --> 03:02.820
to squeeze ahead of Ian Juby to win this year's coveted Golden Crocoduck, five years after

03:02.820 --> 03:09.700
his dad won the very same award. So let's look back at Eric's spectacular rise to fame.

03:09.700 --> 03:13.080
Even as a youth, Eric featured in his dad's seminars and speeches.

03:13.080 --> 03:19.220
We live in Pensacola, Florida. Been there for 15 years. I have three kids, one of each.

03:19.220 --> 03:24.400
And when Hovind Sr was locked up in the Pensacola penitentiary for cheating on his taxes, young

03:24.400 --> 03:29.600
Eric took to introducing his videos. Why are we here? Where do we come from, for

03:29.600 --> 03:34.200
that matter? Where are we going to go when this life is over? I don't know. In this seminar

03:34.200 --> 03:38.460
that talks about the age of the Earth, Dr Hovind gives solid evidence to show that this

03:38.460 --> 03:42.900
Earth is not billions of years old. And it wasn't too much of a step to then blow the

03:42.900 --> 03:47.380
dust off Dad's old scripts and make a living out of reading them aloud.

03:47.380 --> 03:53.060
We still see spiral arms on our galaxies indicating they are less than billions of years old.

03:53.060 --> 03:59.260
What about in here for billions of years, there should be lots of supernovas out there.

03:59.260 --> 04:06.260
You can't consistently lose heat until eventually you get cold. But Jupiter is still very hot.

04:07.020 --> 04:11.820
Well, how could it be losing heat for billions of years and still be...

04:11.820 --> 04:16.580
Now Eric seems to pop up everywhere, from his Christian Science Evangelism videos to

04:16.580 --> 04:21.860
chat shows with Ray Comfort. And because of this, we're beginning to get a much clearer

04:21.860 --> 04:25.460
and rather disturbing picture of him. So if you're taught that you're nothing but

04:25.460 --> 04:32.160
an animal and that you're nothing but something that has no morals, there are no moral absolutes,

04:32.160 --> 04:37.040
you're going to behave that way. Sex outside of marriage, who cares? Lying, stealing,

04:37.040 --> 04:42.040
who cares? It wouldn't matter. I had an AWS on the fundamentally flawed podcast with a

04:42.040 --> 04:46.680
couple of atheists and they asked me, they said, Eric, if you were not a Christian, would

04:46.680 --> 04:51.320
that, would that let you just do anything you want to do? I said, absolutely. I would

04:51.320 --> 04:56.920
live my life with absolutely no restraints at all. I would do whatever I want.

04:56.920 --> 05:01.480
You would? Boy, I hate to say it, Eric, but if that's the case, then your morals are worse

05:01.520 --> 05:07.120
than any atheist I know. After all, most Christians don't become cheats, liars and thieves when

05:07.120 --> 05:12.060
they lose their faith. I certainly didn't. And most of the people in France or Japan

05:12.060 --> 05:17.120
or Sweden don't seem to need Jesus in order to lead honest and decent lives.

05:17.120 --> 05:22.680
Yes, we do do what we feel like and what makes us happy, but as long as it doesn't harm or

05:22.680 --> 05:28.500
inconvenience anyone, if you had a frustrating and sexless youth, that's too bad, but don't

05:28.500 --> 05:34.380
expect the rest of us to follow suit. Because for us, sex between two consenting adults

05:34.380 --> 05:41.020
prior to marriage is perfectly okay. But stealing someone's wallet or cheating on taxes, well

05:41.020 --> 05:47.160
of course that's not okay because that does hurt or inconvenience other people. If billions

05:47.160 --> 05:51.380
of law abiding people can refrain from cheating and stealing without the threat of hell and

05:51.380 --> 05:57.840
damnation, then surely, Eric, you can do it too. If you can't, then I'd respectfully suggest

05:57.860 --> 06:02.360
that there might be something worryingly wrong with your basic upbringing and character.

06:02.360 --> 06:05.020
And that's where we get lots of... you guys get lots of testimonies.

06:05.020 --> 06:07.440
I'd be in jail if I wasn't a Christian.

06:07.440 --> 06:13.700
Oh, awkward moment. Bit of a low blow, Ray. Thank goodness Eric follows Jesus and doesn't

06:13.700 --> 06:20.700
behave like an animal, sort of. Since that vicious attack, the left comfort unable to

06:21.600 --> 06:26.800
perform marital duties, Eric has continued preaching his dad's peculiar version of science

06:26.840 --> 06:32.080
to the creationist masses. And Eric was even able to call in an expert witness.

06:32.080 --> 06:35.640
We got to come out here to California and I'm having the pleasure of sitting down with

06:35.640 --> 06:41.920
a geophysicist that unfortunately has to remain anonymous. So, can I call you Steve?

06:41.920 --> 06:42.760
My name is Gladys.

06:42.760 --> 06:47.640
Alright, so Steve is going to share with us... now, just Steve, let me ask you as a geophysicist

06:47.640 --> 06:53.200
that works in the profession out there, actually doing the work of a geologist and things like

06:53.200 --> 06:57.840
that, what... are you really concerned about people knowing your identity because it will

06:57.840 --> 07:00.080
affect your job? Absolutely.

07:00.080 --> 07:05.440
Actually, the pixelated geophysicist did make one interesting point. Eric Hovind, you may

07:05.440 --> 07:10.400
remember, was first nominated for a Golden Crocoduck for this absurd suggestion.

07:10.400 --> 07:16.840
The Colorado River exits the canyon 1800 feet above sea level. It enters the canyon 2800

07:16.840 --> 07:22.680
feet above sea level. And the top of Grand Canyon is 7000 feet above sea level. So you

07:22.680 --> 07:27.880
tell me, did the river flow uphill for millions of years to carve out the Grand Canyon?

07:27.880 --> 07:32.840
And as I explained, rivers don't flow uphill. What happened was that the Colorado Plateau

07:32.840 --> 07:39.040
was uplifted and then eroded by the Colorado River that sat on top of it. Uplift and erosion

07:39.040 --> 07:45.040
are the two most basic principles of geology. Well, it seems Eric took this on board.

07:45.040 --> 07:49.880
Whenever I presented the whole idea of the Kaibab uplift and how it had to be cut through

07:49.880 --> 07:57.640
a breach dam, the offence, the evolution aside is no, the ground rose up while the

07:57.640 --> 08:02.120
river continued to carve for millions of years and they say all that layer you can trace

08:02.120 --> 08:06.400
and you can see that it has risen up that high over the last several million years.

08:06.400 --> 08:12.560
Any evidence to that? Has it risen up? Yeah. I suppose it has. It's higher. I think that's

08:12.560 --> 08:14.200
kind of a no brainer.

08:14.200 --> 08:18.880
So there you have it, Eric. Even your own pixelated geophysicist tells you the Colorado

08:18.880 --> 08:25.520
River never flowed uphill. He agrees the plateau was uplifted, just as I said. So Eric,

08:25.520 --> 08:29.640
you've learned something. And as Dave Barry would say, we've learned something too. The

08:29.640 --> 08:33.440
pixelated geophysicist would be a great name for a rock band.

08:33.440 --> 08:40.280
I love it that here we have a geologist that is a professional that says, yeah, the evidence

08:40.280 --> 08:47.800
fits is consistent with the biblical world view.

08:47.800 --> 08:51.720
Don't miss the rest of this Creation Science Evangelism series.

08:51.720 --> 08:54.440
Eric Hovind interviews a biologist.

08:54.440 --> 08:57.280
Eric Hovind interviews a cosmologist.

08:57.280 --> 09:05.560
Eric Hovind interviews a chemist whose nose has been replaced by a penis.

09:05.560 --> 09:10.080
After years of plugging away at science and presenting this solid evidence of a young

09:10.080 --> 09:15.560
Earth to creationist audiences, Eric finally got the chance to present his solid scientific

09:15.560 --> 09:20.920
evidence to a couple of real scientists at the Reason rally in Washington, Thunderf00t

09:20.920 --> 09:26.600
and Aaron Ra. Now was his chance to confound them with how galaxies should have spun out

09:26.600 --> 09:31.560
and how the recession of the Moon proves a young Earth. So what would be his first question

09:31.560 --> 09:36.360
to stump them? How can we find blood cells in dinosaur bones or trees growing through

09:36.360 --> 09:40.320
millions of years of sediment? Nope, his first question was this.

09:40.320 --> 09:43.200
Is it impossible for God to exist?

09:43.200 --> 09:49.120
Hang on, Eric, every time you talk to creationists you bring up your solid scientific evidence.

09:49.120 --> 09:52.240
Solid evidence to show that this Earth is not billions of years old.

09:52.240 --> 09:57.400
After all, your organisation is called Creation Science Evangelism. But when you get the chance

09:57.400 --> 10:02.400
to show real scientists what they got wrong and stump them with your solid evidence, you

10:02.400 --> 10:08.840
chicken out. You ask a vague, banal and unanswerable question that pertains to philosophy rather

10:08.840 --> 10:12.040
than science.

10:12.040 --> 10:14.080
The question is malformed.

10:14.080 --> 10:17.400
Is it impossible, is it an absolute impossibility for God to exist?

10:17.400 --> 10:22.360
Of course it's a malformed question on many levels. My problem with the question, and

10:22.360 --> 10:28.360
I get asked it a lot, is that Hovind hasn't defined what this God thing is. In another

10:28.360 --> 10:30.280
debate he defined it as this.

10:30.280 --> 10:37.280
Here's the definition again. God is a spirit, infinite, eternal and unchanging in his being,

10:37.600 --> 10:43.800
wisdom, power, holiness, justice, goodness and truth. So my definition of God is right

10:43.800 --> 10:48.800
there and that's what I'll be wanting to talk about as far as we talk to you guys.

10:48.800 --> 10:55.800
He's a spirit. So that's kind of a simple definition of what is God. So is it impossible

10:56.080 --> 11:02.760
that a spirit exists that has all knowledge, all power, he's infinite, eternal, unchanging,

11:02.760 --> 11:05.080
is that an impossibility that that exists?

11:05.080 --> 11:10.000
But of course that's not a definition of what Eric believes the God is. This description

11:10.000 --> 11:15.040
is so vague it covers just about every God in every religion ever invented. Some people

11:15.040 --> 11:21.240
define this spirit as the God of Jewish tradition who made the universe 6,500 years ago and

11:21.240 --> 11:26.360
came to earth in human form or made Mohammed his prophet. Others think the God made the

11:26.360 --> 11:31.940
universe 13.7 billion years ago and controlled its development. Some think this God made

11:31.980 --> 11:36.380
all the animals and plants instantaneously, others think it directed evolution, others

11:36.380 --> 11:42.100
think it created life and let evolution unfold on its own. So in the interest of clarity,

11:42.100 --> 11:47.140
Eric, did your particular God make all the animals and planets and stars and galaxies

11:47.140 --> 11:54.140
in a single week about 6,500 years ago? The answer is yes, thank you. And did it flood

11:54.620 --> 12:00.820
the entire world 4,000 years ago? Yes again. So if that's your definition of God then

12:00.860 --> 12:06.260
the answer to your question is yes, it is impossible for this God to exist because we

12:06.260 --> 12:11.020
know that these feats attributed to it either didn't happen or didn't happen in the time

12:11.020 --> 12:17.040
scale you claim. We know this through observable geological, cosmological, physical, chemical

12:17.040 --> 12:22.100
and biological evidence. Now if you want to dispute that, that's where we can discuss

12:22.100 --> 12:27.280
the geological, cosmological, physical, chemical and biological evidence that you claim supports

12:27.320 --> 12:32.320
the creation of everything 6,500 years ago and the flooding of the world 4,000 years

12:32.320 --> 12:37.120
ago. Since you've gone out of your way to avoid having that discussion, I suspect you

12:37.120 --> 12:42.180
know that your evidence isn't that solid and is only suitable for gullible creationist

12:42.180 --> 12:48.100
audiences rather than knowledgeable scientists. The encounter with Thunderf00t culminated

12:48.100 --> 12:55.100
in this rather poignant question. Are they actually, if they believe in God, are they

12:57.280 --> 13:04.280
brain cells? Do they know that? How do you know that you are one of these people? You

13:11.520 --> 13:17.080
heard right, Eric Fitts his own characterisation of someone in a psych ward. A lot of people

13:17.080 --> 13:21.680
in psych wards, Eric agrees, believe they have a revelation from an invisible being,

13:21.680 --> 13:26.640
whether it's Jesus, an alien from another planet or a pink rabbit. But the reason Eric

13:26.640 --> 13:31.520
doesn't think he belongs in a psych ward is because he has a revelation from an invisible

13:31.520 --> 13:38.520
being. So is he dangerous and insane? No, I think Eric's just safely delusional. The

13:38.520 --> 13:43.400
reason he thinks he'd be dangerous without Jesus, despite the walking evidence of billions

13:43.400 --> 13:48.800
of nice honest people who don't have a messiah, is because that's what he was told day in,

13:48.800 --> 13:54.180
day out, every day of his childhood. Make kids believe this year after year and eventually

13:54.420 --> 13:59.180
they won't be able to unbelieve it. Without Jesus, you can't function as a decent human

13:59.180 --> 14:04.060
being. If you don't believe in God, you'll burn in hell forever. If his parents had been

14:04.060 --> 14:09.480
equally devout Muslims, you'd see Eric with a beard on YouTube slamming Christian blasphemers.

14:09.480 --> 14:13.900
If his parents had been members of the Phelps family, he'd be holding up a God hates fags

14:13.900 --> 14:19.860
sign at the funerals of American soldiers. Eric is the perfect example of how easy it

14:19.900 --> 14:24.940
is to mould children into believing whatever the parents believe, as long as you shut them

14:24.940 --> 14:30.380
off from outside influences during their formative years and scare them enough. But that's no

14:30.380 --> 14:36.240
excuse for making speeches and videos designed to mislead people about science, which makes

14:36.240 --> 14:42.260
Eric a deserving winner for the 2012 Golden Crocoduck. So as the litter is swept away

14:42.260 --> 14:46.980
from the St Jude Thaddeus Theatre and the last molested boy limps home from the Catholic

14:46.980 --> 14:52.540
after party, it's time to bid farewell to this year's Golden Crocoduck. Congratulations

14:52.540 --> 14:57.740
Eric, the award is in the mail. And that's as true as the uphill climb of the Colorado

14:57.740 --> 14:58.100
River.
