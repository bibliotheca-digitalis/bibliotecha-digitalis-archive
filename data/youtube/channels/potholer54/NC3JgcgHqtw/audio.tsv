0	7000	Welcome to the fourth annual Golden Crocoduck Award.
10600	15880	Thank you, thank you ladies and gentlemen. Oh, you're too kind. And my thanks to St Jude
15880	21160	Thaddeus, the patron saint of lost causes, for hosting this glittering event.
21160	25240	Well it's been an exciting day. All the stars have been gathering for the award ceremony
25240	29920	here at St Jude's Theatre. There's the Pope arriving, sharing an intimate moment with
29920	36080	St Jude himself. And could it be? Yes, even Kent Hogan has arrived to watch the show,
36080	41400	of course coming in the back way. As you know, his son is one of the contenders for a coveted
41400	45980	Golden Crocoduck this year, awarded for the biggest breach of the ninth commandment in
45980	50700	pursuit of the creationist cause. And they're all in for a real treat, because it's been
50700	55560	an exciting and closely fought contest this year. There was a lively debate on the voting
55560	60760	video forum, and as voting proceeded, it soon became clear that we had no obvious front
60760	66380	runner. Two of the contestants were running neck and neck. So let's announce the results
66380	73380	in time-honoured Golden Crocoduck tradition by starting from the back of the field.
110700	117700	Yes, we now come to the top two. As I said, the number of votes they were receiving throughout
125920	131320	the count were very close. It was a kind of Dewey vs Truman moment, because I started
131320	138320	to prepare videos on both of them. And the final vote tally was a nail-biting 1,278 votes
138440	145440	against 1,209. So who had the highest score? Well, let's introduce him with his own immortal
146360	153360	catchphrase. I should have listened to my daily.
168320	175320	Yes, Eric Hovind, the rascal, showed that he's a chip off the old block and just managed
177280	182820	to squeeze ahead of Ian Juby to win this year's coveted Golden Crocoduck, five years after
182820	189700	his dad won the very same award. So let's look back at Eric's spectacular rise to fame.
189700	193080	Even as a youth, Eric featured in his dad's seminars and speeches.
193080	199220	We live in Pensacola, Florida. Been there for 15 years. I have three kids, one of each.
199220	204400	And when Hovind Sr was locked up in the Pensacola penitentiary for cheating on his taxes, young
204400	209600	Eric took to introducing his videos. Why are we here? Where do we come from, for
209600	214200	that matter? Where are we going to go when this life is over? I don't know. In this seminar
214200	218460	that talks about the age of the Earth, Dr Hovind gives solid evidence to show that this
218460	222900	Earth is not billions of years old. And it wasn't too much of a step to then blow the
222900	227380	dust off Dad's old scripts and make a living out of reading them aloud.
227380	233060	We still see spiral arms on our galaxies indicating they are less than billions of years old.
233060	239260	What about in here for billions of years, there should be lots of supernovas out there.
239260	246260	You can't consistently lose heat until eventually you get cold. But Jupiter is still very hot.
247020	251820	Well, how could it be losing heat for billions of years and still be...
251820	256580	Now Eric seems to pop up everywhere, from his Christian Science Evangelism videos to
256580	261860	chat shows with Ray Comfort. And because of this, we're beginning to get a much clearer
261860	265460	and rather disturbing picture of him. So if you're taught that you're nothing but
265460	272160	an animal and that you're nothing but something that has no morals, there are no moral absolutes,
272160	277040	you're going to behave that way. Sex outside of marriage, who cares? Lying, stealing,
277040	282040	who cares? It wouldn't matter. I had an AWS on the fundamentally flawed podcast with a
282040	286680	couple of atheists and they asked me, they said, Eric, if you were not a Christian, would
286680	291320	that, would that let you just do anything you want to do? I said, absolutely. I would
291320	296920	live my life with absolutely no restraints at all. I would do whatever I want.
296920	301480	You would? Boy, I hate to say it, Eric, but if that's the case, then your morals are worse
301520	307120	than any atheist I know. After all, most Christians don't become cheats, liars and thieves when
307120	312060	they lose their faith. I certainly didn't. And most of the people in France or Japan
312060	317120	or Sweden don't seem to need Jesus in order to lead honest and decent lives.
317120	322680	Yes, we do do what we feel like and what makes us happy, but as long as it doesn't harm or
322680	328500	inconvenience anyone, if you had a frustrating and sexless youth, that's too bad, but don't
328500	334380	expect the rest of us to follow suit. Because for us, sex between two consenting adults
334380	341020	prior to marriage is perfectly okay. But stealing someone's wallet or cheating on taxes, well
341020	347160	of course that's not okay because that does hurt or inconvenience other people. If billions
347160	351380	of law abiding people can refrain from cheating and stealing without the threat of hell and
351380	357840	damnation, then surely, Eric, you can do it too. If you can't, then I'd respectfully suggest
357860	362360	that there might be something worryingly wrong with your basic upbringing and character.
362360	365020	And that's where we get lots of... you guys get lots of testimonies.
365020	367440	I'd be in jail if I wasn't a Christian.
367440	373700	Oh, awkward moment. Bit of a low blow, Ray. Thank goodness Eric follows Jesus and doesn't
373700	380700	behave like an animal, sort of. Since that vicious attack, the left comfort unable to
381600	386800	perform marital duties, Eric has continued preaching his dad's peculiar version of science
386840	392080	to the creationist masses. And Eric was even able to call in an expert witness.
392080	395640	We got to come out here to California and I'm having the pleasure of sitting down with
395640	401920	a geophysicist that unfortunately has to remain anonymous. So, can I call you Steve?
401920	402760	My name is Gladys.
402760	407640	Alright, so Steve is going to share with us... now, just Steve, let me ask you as a geophysicist
407640	413200	that works in the profession out there, actually doing the work of a geologist and things like
413200	417840	that, what... are you really concerned about people knowing your identity because it will
417840	420080	affect your job? Absolutely.
420080	425440	Actually, the pixelated geophysicist did make one interesting point. Eric Hovind, you may
425440	430400	remember, was first nominated for a Golden Crocoduck for this absurd suggestion.
430400	436840	The Colorado River exits the canyon 1800 feet above sea level. It enters the canyon 2800
436840	442680	feet above sea level. And the top of Grand Canyon is 7000 feet above sea level. So you
442680	447880	tell me, did the river flow uphill for millions of years to carve out the Grand Canyon?
447880	452840	And as I explained, rivers don't flow uphill. What happened was that the Colorado Plateau
452840	459040	was uplifted and then eroded by the Colorado River that sat on top of it. Uplift and erosion
459040	465040	are the two most basic principles of geology. Well, it seems Eric took this on board.
465040	469880	Whenever I presented the whole idea of the Kaibab uplift and how it had to be cut through
469880	477640	a breach dam, the offence, the evolution aside is no, the ground rose up while the
477640	482120	river continued to carve for millions of years and they say all that layer you can trace
482120	486400	and you can see that it has risen up that high over the last several million years.
486400	492560	Any evidence to that? Has it risen up? Yeah. I suppose it has. It's higher. I think that's
492560	494200	kind of a no brainer.
494200	498880	So there you have it, Eric. Even your own pixelated geophysicist tells you the Colorado
498880	505520	River never flowed uphill. He agrees the plateau was uplifted, just as I said. So Eric,
505520	509640	you've learned something. And as Dave Barry would say, we've learned something too. The
509640	513440	pixelated geophysicist would be a great name for a rock band.
513440	520280	I love it that here we have a geologist that is a professional that says, yeah, the evidence
520280	527800	fits is consistent with the biblical world view.
527800	531720	Don't miss the rest of this Creation Science Evangelism series.
531720	534440	Eric Hovind interviews a biologist.
534440	537280	Eric Hovind interviews a cosmologist.
537280	545560	Eric Hovind interviews a chemist whose nose has been replaced by a penis.
545560	550080	After years of plugging away at science and presenting this solid evidence of a young
550080	555560	Earth to creationist audiences, Eric finally got the chance to present his solid scientific
555560	560920	evidence to a couple of real scientists at the Reason rally in Washington, Thunderf00t
560920	566600	and Aaron Ra. Now was his chance to confound them with how galaxies should have spun out
566600	571560	and how the recession of the Moon proves a young Earth. So what would be his first question
571560	576360	to stump them? How can we find blood cells in dinosaur bones or trees growing through
576360	580320	millions of years of sediment? Nope, his first question was this.
580320	583200	Is it impossible for God to exist?
583200	589120	Hang on, Eric, every time you talk to creationists you bring up your solid scientific evidence.
589120	592240	Solid evidence to show that this Earth is not billions of years old.
592240	597400	After all, your organisation is called Creation Science Evangelism. But when you get the chance
597400	602400	to show real scientists what they got wrong and stump them with your solid evidence, you
602400	608840	chicken out. You ask a vague, banal and unanswerable question that pertains to philosophy rather
608840	612040	than science.
612040	614080	The question is malformed.
614080	617400	Is it impossible, is it an absolute impossibility for God to exist?
617400	622360	Of course it's a malformed question on many levels. My problem with the question, and
622360	628360	I get asked it a lot, is that Hovind hasn't defined what this God thing is. In another
628360	630280	debate he defined it as this.
630280	637280	Here's the definition again. God is a spirit, infinite, eternal and unchanging in his being,
637600	643800	wisdom, power, holiness, justice, goodness and truth. So my definition of God is right
643800	648800	there and that's what I'll be wanting to talk about as far as we talk to you guys.
648800	655800	He's a spirit. So that's kind of a simple definition of what is God. So is it impossible
656080	662760	that a spirit exists that has all knowledge, all power, he's infinite, eternal, unchanging,
662760	665080	is that an impossibility that that exists?
665080	670000	But of course that's not a definition of what Eric believes the God is. This description
670000	675040	is so vague it covers just about every God in every religion ever invented. Some people
675040	681240	define this spirit as the God of Jewish tradition who made the universe 6,500 years ago and
681240	686360	came to earth in human form or made Mohammed his prophet. Others think the God made the
686360	691940	universe 13.7 billion years ago and controlled its development. Some think this God made
691980	696380	all the animals and plants instantaneously, others think it directed evolution, others
696380	702100	think it created life and let evolution unfold on its own. So in the interest of clarity,
702100	707140	Eric, did your particular God make all the animals and planets and stars and galaxies
707140	714140	in a single week about 6,500 years ago? The answer is yes, thank you. And did it flood
714620	720820	the entire world 4,000 years ago? Yes again. So if that's your definition of God then
720860	726260	the answer to your question is yes, it is impossible for this God to exist because we
726260	731020	know that these feats attributed to it either didn't happen or didn't happen in the time
731020	737040	scale you claim. We know this through observable geological, cosmological, physical, chemical
737040	742100	and biological evidence. Now if you want to dispute that, that's where we can discuss
742100	747280	the geological, cosmological, physical, chemical and biological evidence that you claim supports
747320	752320	the creation of everything 6,500 years ago and the flooding of the world 4,000 years
752320	757120	ago. Since you've gone out of your way to avoid having that discussion, I suspect you
757120	762180	know that your evidence isn't that solid and is only suitable for gullible creationist
762180	768100	audiences rather than knowledgeable scientists. The encounter with Thunderf00t culminated
768100	775100	in this rather poignant question. Are they actually, if they believe in God, are they
777280	784280	brain cells? Do they know that? How do you know that you are one of these people? You
791520	797080	heard right, Eric Fitts his own characterisation of someone in a psych ward. A lot of people
797080	801680	in psych wards, Eric agrees, believe they have a revelation from an invisible being,
801680	806640	whether it's Jesus, an alien from another planet or a pink rabbit. But the reason Eric
806640	811520	doesn't think he belongs in a psych ward is because he has a revelation from an invisible
811520	818520	being. So is he dangerous and insane? No, I think Eric's just safely delusional. The
818520	823400	reason he thinks he'd be dangerous without Jesus, despite the walking evidence of billions
823400	828800	of nice honest people who don't have a messiah, is because that's what he was told day in,
828800	834180	day out, every day of his childhood. Make kids believe this year after year and eventually
834420	839180	they won't be able to unbelieve it. Without Jesus, you can't function as a decent human
839180	844060	being. If you don't believe in God, you'll burn in hell forever. If his parents had been
844060	849480	equally devout Muslims, you'd see Eric with a beard on YouTube slamming Christian blasphemers.
849480	853900	If his parents had been members of the Phelps family, he'd be holding up a God hates fags
853900	859860	sign at the funerals of American soldiers. Eric is the perfect example of how easy it
859900	864940	is to mould children into believing whatever the parents believe, as long as you shut them
864940	870380	off from outside influences during their formative years and scare them enough. But that's no
870380	876240	excuse for making speeches and videos designed to mislead people about science, which makes
876240	882260	Eric a deserving winner for the 2012 Golden Crocoduck. So as the litter is swept away
882260	886980	from the St Jude Thaddeus Theatre and the last molested boy limps home from the Catholic
886980	892540	after party, it's time to bid farewell to this year's Golden Crocoduck. Congratulations
892540	897740	Eric, the award is in the mail. And that's as true as the uphill climb of the Colorado
897740	898100	River.
