00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,000
Welcome to the fourth annual Golden Crocoduck Award.

2
00:00:10,600 --> 00:00:15,880
Thank you, thank you ladies and gentlemen. Oh, you're too kind. And my thanks to St Jude

3
00:00:15,880 --> 00:00:21,160
Thaddeus, the patron saint of lost causes, for hosting this glittering event.

4
00:00:21,160 --> 00:00:25,240
Well it's been an exciting day. All the stars have been gathering for the award ceremony

5
00:00:25,240 --> 00:00:29,920
here at St Jude's Theatre. There's the Pope arriving, sharing an intimate moment with

6
00:00:29,920 --> 00:00:36,080
St Jude himself. And could it be? Yes, even Kent Hogan has arrived to watch the show,

7
00:00:36,080 --> 00:00:41,400
of course coming in the back way. As you know, his son is one of the contenders for a coveted

8
00:00:41,400 --> 00:00:45,980
Golden Crocoduck this year, awarded for the biggest breach of the ninth commandment in

9
00:00:45,980 --> 00:00:50,700
pursuit of the creationist cause. And they're all in for a real treat, because it's been

10
00:00:50,700 --> 00:00:55,560
an exciting and closely fought contest this year. There was a lively debate on the voting

11
00:00:55,560 --> 00:01:00,760
video forum, and as voting proceeded, it soon became clear that we had no obvious front

12
00:01:00,760 --> 00:01:06,380
runner. Two of the contestants were running neck and neck. So let's announce the results

13
00:01:06,380 --> 00:01:13,380
in time-honoured Golden Crocoduck tradition by starting from the back of the field.

14
00:01:50,700 --> 00:01:57,700
Yes, we now come to the top two. As I said, the number of votes they were receiving throughout

15
00:02:05,920 --> 00:02:11,320
the count were very close. It was a kind of Dewey vs Truman moment, because I started

16
00:02:11,320 --> 00:02:18,320
to prepare videos on both of them. And the final vote tally was a nail-biting 1,278 votes

17
00:02:18,440 --> 00:02:25,440
against 1,209. So who had the highest score? Well, let's introduce him with his own immortal

18
00:02:26,360 --> 00:02:33,360
catchphrase. I should have listened to my daily.

19
00:02:48,320 --> 00:02:55,320
Yes, Eric Hovind, the rascal, showed that he's a chip off the old block and just managed

20
00:02:57,280 --> 00:03:02,820
to squeeze ahead of Ian Juby to win this year's coveted Golden Crocoduck, five years after

21
00:03:02,820 --> 00:03:09,700
his dad won the very same award. So let's look back at Eric's spectacular rise to fame.

22
00:03:09,700 --> 00:03:13,080
Even as a youth, Eric featured in his dad's seminars and speeches.

23
00:03:13,080 --> 00:03:19,220
We live in Pensacola, Florida. Been there for 15 years. I have three kids, one of each.

24
00:03:19,220 --> 00:03:24,400
And when Hovind Sr was locked up in the Pensacola penitentiary for cheating on his taxes, young

25
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:29,600
Eric took to introducing his videos. Why are we here? Where do we come from, for

26
00:03:29,600 --> 00:03:34,200
that matter? Where are we going to go when this life is over? I don't know. In this seminar

27
00:03:34,200 --> 00:03:38,460
that talks about the age of the Earth, Dr Hovind gives solid evidence to show that this

28
00:03:38,460 --> 00:03:42,900
Earth is not billions of years old. And it wasn't too much of a step to then blow the

29
00:03:42,900 --> 00:03:47,380
dust off Dad's old scripts and make a living out of reading them aloud.

30
00:03:47,380 --> 00:03:53,060
We still see spiral arms on our galaxies indicating they are less than billions of years old.

31
00:03:53,060 --> 00:03:59,260
What about in here for billions of years, there should be lots of supernovas out there.

32
00:03:59,260 --> 00:04:06,260
You can't consistently lose heat until eventually you get cold. But Jupiter is still very hot.

33
00:04:07,020 --> 00:04:11,820
Well, how could it be losing heat for billions of years and still be...

34
00:04:11,820 --> 00:04:16,580
Now Eric seems to pop up everywhere, from his Christian Science Evangelism videos to

35
00:04:16,580 --> 00:04:21,860
chat shows with Ray Comfort. And because of this, we're beginning to get a much clearer

36
00:04:21,860 --> 00:04:25,460
and rather disturbing picture of him. So if you're taught that you're nothing but

37
00:04:25,460 --> 00:04:32,160
an animal and that you're nothing but something that has no morals, there are no moral absolutes,

38
00:04:32,160 --> 00:04:37,040
you're going to behave that way. Sex outside of marriage, who cares? Lying, stealing,

39
00:04:37,040 --> 00:04:42,040
who cares? It wouldn't matter. I had an AWS on the fundamentally flawed podcast with a

40
00:04:42,040 --> 00:04:46,680
couple of atheists and they asked me, they said, Eric, if you were not a Christian, would

41
00:04:46,680 --> 00:04:51,320
that, would that let you just do anything you want to do? I said, absolutely. I would

42
00:04:51,320 --> 00:04:56,920
live my life with absolutely no restraints at all. I would do whatever I want.

43
00:04:56,920 --> 00:05:01,480
You would? Boy, I hate to say it, Eric, but if that's the case, then your morals are worse

44
00:05:01,520 --> 00:05:07,120
than any atheist I know. After all, most Christians don't become cheats, liars and thieves when

45
00:05:07,120 --> 00:05:12,060
they lose their faith. I certainly didn't. And most of the people in France or Japan

46
00:05:12,060 --> 00:05:17,120
or Sweden don't seem to need Jesus in order to lead honest and decent lives.

47
00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:22,680
Yes, we do do what we feel like and what makes us happy, but as long as it doesn't harm or

48
00:05:22,680 --> 00:05:28,500
inconvenience anyone, if you had a frustrating and sexless youth, that's too bad, but don't

49
00:05:28,500 --> 00:05:34,380
expect the rest of us to follow suit. Because for us, sex between two consenting adults

50
00:05:34,380 --> 00:05:41,020
prior to marriage is perfectly okay. But stealing someone's wallet or cheating on taxes, well

51
00:05:41,020 --> 00:05:47,160
of course that's not okay because that does hurt or inconvenience other people. If billions

52
00:05:47,160 --> 00:05:51,380
of law abiding people can refrain from cheating and stealing without the threat of hell and

53
00:05:51,380 --> 00:05:57,840
damnation, then surely, Eric, you can do it too. If you can't, then I'd respectfully suggest

54
00:05:57,860 --> 00:06:02,360
that there might be something worryingly wrong with your basic upbringing and character.

55
00:06:02,360 --> 00:06:05,020
And that's where we get lots of... you guys get lots of testimonies.

56
00:06:05,020 --> 00:06:07,440
I'd be in jail if I wasn't a Christian.

57
00:06:07,440 --> 00:06:13,700
Oh, awkward moment. Bit of a low blow, Ray. Thank goodness Eric follows Jesus and doesn't

58
00:06:13,700 --> 00:06:20,700
behave like an animal, sort of. Since that vicious attack, the left comfort unable to

59
00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:26,800
perform marital duties, Eric has continued preaching his dad's peculiar version of science

60
00:06:26,840 --> 00:06:32,080
to the creationist masses. And Eric was even able to call in an expert witness.

61
00:06:32,080 --> 00:06:35,640
We got to come out here to California and I'm having the pleasure of sitting down with

62
00:06:35,640 --> 00:06:41,920
a geophysicist that unfortunately has to remain anonymous. So, can I call you Steve?

63
00:06:41,920 --> 00:06:42,760
My name is Gladys.

64
00:06:42,760 --> 00:06:47,640
Alright, so Steve is going to share with us... now, just Steve, let me ask you as a geophysicist

65
00:06:47,640 --> 00:06:53,200
that works in the profession out there, actually doing the work of a geologist and things like

66
00:06:53,200 --> 00:06:57,840
that, what... are you really concerned about people knowing your identity because it will

67
00:06:57,840 --> 00:07:00,080
affect your job? Absolutely.

68
00:07:00,080 --> 00:07:05,440
Actually, the pixelated geophysicist did make one interesting point. Eric Hovind, you may

69
00:07:05,440 --> 00:07:10,400
remember, was first nominated for a Golden Crocoduck for this absurd suggestion.

70
00:07:10,400 --> 00:07:16,840
The Colorado River exits the canyon 1800 feet above sea level. It enters the canyon 2800

71
00:07:16,840 --> 00:07:22,680
feet above sea level. And the top of Grand Canyon is 7000 feet above sea level. So you

72
00:07:22,680 --> 00:07:27,880
tell me, did the river flow uphill for millions of years to carve out the Grand Canyon?

73
00:07:27,880 --> 00:07:32,840
And as I explained, rivers don't flow uphill. What happened was that the Colorado Plateau

74
00:07:32,840 --> 00:07:39,040
was uplifted and then eroded by the Colorado River that sat on top of it. Uplift and erosion

75
00:07:39,040 --> 00:07:45,040
are the two most basic principles of geology. Well, it seems Eric took this on board.

76
00:07:45,040 --> 00:07:49,880
Whenever I presented the whole idea of the Kaibab uplift and how it had to be cut through

77
00:07:49,880 --> 00:07:57,640
a breach dam, the offence, the evolution aside is no, the ground rose up while the

78
00:07:57,640 --> 00:08:02,120
river continued to carve for millions of years and they say all that layer you can trace

79
00:08:02,120 --> 00:08:06,400
and you can see that it has risen up that high over the last several million years.

80
00:08:06,400 --> 00:08:12,560
Any evidence to that? Has it risen up? Yeah. I suppose it has. It's higher. I think that's

81
00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:14,200
kind of a no brainer.

82
00:08:14,200 --> 00:08:18,880
So there you have it, Eric. Even your own pixelated geophysicist tells you the Colorado

83
00:08:18,880 --> 00:08:25,520
River never flowed uphill. He agrees the plateau was uplifted, just as I said. So Eric,

84
00:08:25,520 --> 00:08:29,640
you've learned something. And as Dave Barry would say, we've learned something too. The

85
00:08:29,640 --> 00:08:33,440
pixelated geophysicist would be a great name for a rock band.

86
00:08:33,440 --> 00:08:40,280
I love it that here we have a geologist that is a professional that says, yeah, the evidence

87
00:08:40,280 --> 00:08:47,800
fits is consistent with the biblical world view.

88
00:08:47,800 --> 00:08:51,720
Don't miss the rest of this Creation Science Evangelism series.

89
00:08:51,720 --> 00:08:54,440
Eric Hovind interviews a biologist.

90
00:08:54,440 --> 00:08:57,280
Eric Hovind interviews a cosmologist.

91
00:08:57,280 --> 00:09:05,560
Eric Hovind interviews a chemist whose nose has been replaced by a penis.

92
00:09:05,560 --> 00:09:10,080
After years of plugging away at science and presenting this solid evidence of a young

93
00:09:10,080 --> 00:09:15,560
Earth to creationist audiences, Eric finally got the chance to present his solid scientific

94
00:09:15,560 --> 00:09:20,920
evidence to a couple of real scientists at the Reason rally in Washington, Thunderf00t

95
00:09:20,920 --> 00:09:26,600
and Aaron Ra. Now was his chance to confound them with how galaxies should have spun out

96
00:09:26,600 --> 00:09:31,560
and how the recession of the Moon proves a young Earth. So what would be his first question

97
00:09:31,560 --> 00:09:36,360
to stump them? How can we find blood cells in dinosaur bones or trees growing through

98
00:09:36,360 --> 00:09:40,320
millions of years of sediment? Nope, his first question was this.

99
00:09:40,320 --> 00:09:43,200
Is it impossible for God to exist?

100
00:09:43,200 --> 00:09:49,120
Hang on, Eric, every time you talk to creationists you bring up your solid scientific evidence.

101
00:09:49,120 --> 00:09:52,240
Solid evidence to show that this Earth is not billions of years old.

102
00:09:52,240 --> 00:09:57,400
After all, your organisation is called Creation Science Evangelism. But when you get the chance

103
00:09:57,400 --> 00:10:02,400
to show real scientists what they got wrong and stump them with your solid evidence, you

104
00:10:02,400 --> 00:10:08,840
chicken out. You ask a vague, banal and unanswerable question that pertains to philosophy rather

105
00:10:08,840 --> 00:10:12,040
than science.

106
00:10:12,040 --> 00:10:14,080
The question is malformed.

107
00:10:14,080 --> 00:10:17,400
Is it impossible, is it an absolute impossibility for God to exist?

108
00:10:17,400 --> 00:10:22,360
Of course it's a malformed question on many levels. My problem with the question, and

109
00:10:22,360 --> 00:10:28,360
I get asked it a lot, is that Hovind hasn't defined what this God thing is. In another

110
00:10:28,360 --> 00:10:30,280
debate he defined it as this.

111
00:10:30,280 --> 00:10:37,280
Here's the definition again. God is a spirit, infinite, eternal and unchanging in his being,

112
00:10:37,600 --> 00:10:43,800
wisdom, power, holiness, justice, goodness and truth. So my definition of God is right

113
00:10:43,800 --> 00:10:48,800
there and that's what I'll be wanting to talk about as far as we talk to you guys.

114
00:10:48,800 --> 00:10:55,800
He's a spirit. So that's kind of a simple definition of what is God. So is it impossible

115
00:10:56,080 --> 00:11:02,760
that a spirit exists that has all knowledge, all power, he's infinite, eternal, unchanging,

116
00:11:02,760 --> 00:11:05,080
is that an impossibility that that exists?

117
00:11:05,080 --> 00:11:10,000
But of course that's not a definition of what Eric believes the God is. This description

118
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:15,040
is so vague it covers just about every God in every religion ever invented. Some people

119
00:11:15,040 --> 00:11:21,240
define this spirit as the God of Jewish tradition who made the universe 6,500 years ago and

120
00:11:21,240 --> 00:11:26,360
came to earth in human form or made Mohammed his prophet. Others think the God made the

121
00:11:26,360 --> 00:11:31,940
universe 13.7 billion years ago and controlled its development. Some think this God made

122
00:11:31,980 --> 00:11:36,380
all the animals and plants instantaneously, others think it directed evolution, others

123
00:11:36,380 --> 00:11:42,100
think it created life and let evolution unfold on its own. So in the interest of clarity,

124
00:11:42,100 --> 00:11:47,140
Eric, did your particular God make all the animals and planets and stars and galaxies

125
00:11:47,140 --> 00:11:54,140
in a single week about 6,500 years ago? The answer is yes, thank you. And did it flood

126
00:11:54,620 --> 00:12:00,820
the entire world 4,000 years ago? Yes again. So if that's your definition of God then

127
00:12:00,860 --> 00:12:06,260
the answer to your question is yes, it is impossible for this God to exist because we

128
00:12:06,260 --> 00:12:11,020
know that these feats attributed to it either didn't happen or didn't happen in the time

129
00:12:11,020 --> 00:12:17,040
scale you claim. We know this through observable geological, cosmological, physical, chemical

130
00:12:17,040 --> 00:12:22,100
and biological evidence. Now if you want to dispute that, that's where we can discuss

131
00:12:22,100 --> 00:12:27,280
the geological, cosmological, physical, chemical and biological evidence that you claim supports

132
00:12:27,320 --> 00:12:32,320
the creation of everything 6,500 years ago and the flooding of the world 4,000 years

133
00:12:32,320 --> 00:12:37,120
ago. Since you've gone out of your way to avoid having that discussion, I suspect you

134
00:12:37,120 --> 00:12:42,180
know that your evidence isn't that solid and is only suitable for gullible creationist

135
00:12:42,180 --> 00:12:48,100
audiences rather than knowledgeable scientists. The encounter with Thunderf00t culminated

136
00:12:48,100 --> 00:12:55,100
in this rather poignant question. Are they actually, if they believe in God, are they

137
00:12:57,280 --> 00:13:04,280
brain cells? Do they know that? How do you know that you are one of these people? You

138
00:13:11,520 --> 00:13:17,080
heard right, Eric Fitts his own characterisation of someone in a psych ward. A lot of people

139
00:13:17,080 --> 00:13:21,680
in psych wards, Eric agrees, believe they have a revelation from an invisible being,

140
00:13:21,680 --> 00:13:26,640
whether it's Jesus, an alien from another planet or a pink rabbit. But the reason Eric

141
00:13:26,640 --> 00:13:31,520
doesn't think he belongs in a psych ward is because he has a revelation from an invisible

142
00:13:31,520 --> 00:13:38,520
being. So is he dangerous and insane? No, I think Eric's just safely delusional. The

143
00:13:38,520 --> 00:13:43,400
reason he thinks he'd be dangerous without Jesus, despite the walking evidence of billions

144
00:13:43,400 --> 00:13:48,800
of nice honest people who don't have a messiah, is because that's what he was told day in,

145
00:13:48,800 --> 00:13:54,180
day out, every day of his childhood. Make kids believe this year after year and eventually

146
00:13:54,420 --> 00:13:59,180
they won't be able to unbelieve it. Without Jesus, you can't function as a decent human

147
00:13:59,180 --> 00:14:04,060
being. If you don't believe in God, you'll burn in hell forever. If his parents had been

148
00:14:04,060 --> 00:14:09,480
equally devout Muslims, you'd see Eric with a beard on YouTube slamming Christian blasphemers.

149
00:14:09,480 --> 00:14:13,900
If his parents had been members of the Phelps family, he'd be holding up a God hates fags

150
00:14:13,900 --> 00:14:19,860
sign at the funerals of American soldiers. Eric is the perfect example of how easy it

151
00:14:19,900 --> 00:14:24,940
is to mould children into believing whatever the parents believe, as long as you shut them

152
00:14:24,940 --> 00:14:30,380
off from outside influences during their formative years and scare them enough. But that's no

153
00:14:30,380 --> 00:14:36,240
excuse for making speeches and videos designed to mislead people about science, which makes

154
00:14:36,240 --> 00:14:42,260
Eric a deserving winner for the 2012 Golden Crocoduck. So as the litter is swept away

155
00:14:42,260 --> 00:14:46,980
from the St Jude Thaddeus Theatre and the last molested boy limps home from the Catholic

156
00:14:46,980 --> 00:14:52,540
after party, it's time to bid farewell to this year's Golden Crocoduck. Congratulations

157
00:14:52,540 --> 00:14:57,740
Eric, the award is in the mail. And that's as true as the uphill climb of the Colorado

158
00:14:57,740 --> 00:14:58,100
River.
