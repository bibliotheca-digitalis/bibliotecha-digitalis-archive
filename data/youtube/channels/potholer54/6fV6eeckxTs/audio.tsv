0	5760	Oh dear, part one of this video seems to have upset people on both sides of the political spectrum.
5760	8000	I'll take a look at their comments later in the video.
8640	12240	I'll also look at the Kyoto Protocol, explain cap and trade,
12240	17280	and answer more objections to the exciting new technologies being offered by the free market
17280	18960	to reduce CO2 emissions.
19680	25840	Like part one, this video will also be opinion, based on sources cited in the video description.
25840	29200	But after this, the channel will revert to its stated purpose
29200	32400	of checking facts and busting junk science in the media.
33360	36080	My premise in part one was pretty simple.
36080	40480	I came to the conclusion in my early 20s that a totally free society,
40480	45200	stripped of all government controls, is guided by this basic principle.
45200	48400	That everyone is free to do whatever he or she wants,
48400	51120	like start a pig farm or build a smelting plant,
51120	54560	as long as that doesn't conflict with someone else's freedom,
54560	57360	like drinking clean water or running a hotel.
58080	61600	So protection of people's environment, business and property
61600	64480	is a basic conservative and libertarian principle.
65520	70320	So how can so many conservatives now believe this is purely a left-wing issue?
70880	73120	Well, because that's what they've been told.
73760	77600	People who oppose technology and the human prosperity it brings with it
77600	81920	have been looking for any excuse to slow or even turn off the engine of the world.
82640	84560	In the 1980s, they found it.
85120	86080	Global warming.
86960	90320	Since then, environmentalists, the media and Hollywood
90320	93600	have worked to frighten the American people into accepting laws
93600	96400	that restrict access to energy and raise its price.
97520	102480	Fear of technology and an uncertain future created today's global warming movement.
102480	106880	I hate to let facts get in the way of a good story, but as we saw in part one,
106880	111680	it was a staunch conservative who first broadcast the message about climate change.
111680	114080	No government had taken the issue seriously
114080	118400	until Margaret Thatcher spread the message in a series of international speeches.
118400	122720	I spoke about the global threat of climate change.
122720	127600	Here's more from that speech describing Thatcher's vision of a conservative solution.
127600	133840	Until recently, we've always thought that whatever progress humanity makes,
133840	136000	our planet would stay much the same.
137280	138640	That may no longer be true.
139600	143120	The way we generate energy, the way we use land,
143840	147600	the way industry uses natural resources and disposes of waste,
148320	150720	the way our populations multiply,
151680	158160	those things taken together are new in the experience of the earth.
159520	164080	They threaten to change the atmosphere above us and the sea around us.
165120	168400	That is the scale of the global challenge.
169200	173760	We have to work to solve these problems on a sound scientific basis
173760	176240	so that our remedies will be effective.
178960	182160	So if you're an American conservative who accepts the science
182160	186480	but has been scared into believing that the only solution is Marxist world government.
186480	190720	They are about to impose a communist world government on the world.
190720	194480	Or even if you're just going along with the climate change is a hoax stuff
194480	198400	because you've been told it's the politically correct position you're supposed to hold,
198960	201280	then I hope this video will show otherwise.
201920	203520	So continuing on from part one,
203520	207120	let's look at more objections from people who call themselves conservatives.
208640	212640	In 1997, the biggest per capita emitters of carbon dioxide
212640	219120	agreed at Kyoto to get their CO2 emissions back to below 1990 levels by 2012.
220000	224960	Of the eligible countries, only the United States and Australia didn't sign up,
224960	227280	although Australia did so a few years later.
227920	233040	Campaigning by a fossil fuel industry lobby group called the Global Climate Coalition
233040	236480	and political organisations like the Heritage Foundation
236480	240480	convinced American politicians that such drastic cuts would be
240480	245680	economically devastating and risk the economic security of future generations.
246240	251200	A 1997 pamphlet by the Heritage Foundation aimed at members of Congress
251200	253600	claimed the Kyoto Protocol would
253600	256400	retired economic production every year,
256400	262880	result in a 3.3 trillion dollar loss of income between 2001 and 2020.
262880	268640	There are some who'd like for us to imagine a world without coal-based electricity.
268640	271600	Okay then, let's see what that would look like.
271600	276160	Without coal-based power plants, we wouldn't have reliable electricity.
276160	278480	Electricity prices would rise,
278480	280960	local communities would lose jobs,
280960	283760	and our national economy would suffer.
283760	287440	So yes, we can imagine a world without coal,
287440	289520	and it's a pretty scary place to be.
290400	293360	Three years later, the lobbying was aimed at President Bush.
294080	298880	Again, the Heritage Foundation warned of devastating economic consequences
298880	302560	if the US cut its carbon emissions in line with the Kyoto Protocol.
303280	308880	For the economy to keep growing, CO2 emissions would have to rise by 1.2% a year.
308880	313600	That would be around 34% above 1990 levels by 2010.
314560	316320	So the United States stayed out.
317280	321520	Everyone else went ahead anyway and tried to meet the reduction targets in two ways.
322240	327120	The first was carbon pricing, which lobbyists labelled a carbon tax.
327120	330880	It's based on the old established principle that the polluter pays,
330880	334160	whether it's pig waste, sulphur dioxide, or CO2.
335040	339360	If you want to say, but carbon dioxide isn't a pollutant, it's essential for life.
340160	341120	Carbon dioxide.
342080	343040	They call it pollution.
344640	345520	We call it life.
346160	347760	Well, so is calcium.
347760	348560	So is water.
349200	353600	That still doesn't give you the right to dump a load of cement in my backyard
353600	356560	or divert water from your property onto my property.
357200	360800	As long as you're putting something in the air, the water, or on land
360800	364400	that's adversely affecting my property and my environment,
364400	368080	then whether you want to call it pollution or an unwanted gift,
368080	371440	you're infringing on my freedom and my property rights.
372640	375840	I read a lot of comments from people who are scared of carbon pricing
375840	379120	without even understanding what it is or how it would affect them.
379680	382800	Carbon pricing is new and a bit mysterious.
382800	387200	But the term carbon tax, well, that's more snappy and more familiar.
387920	390640	Everyone understands what a tax is, right?
390640	392640	It means you have to pay money to the government.
393280	395120	Well, not quite.
395120	398720	I'm happy to use the term as long as people understand what it means.
399600	405200	When my adopted country, Australia, finally ratified the Kyoto Protocol in 2012,
405200	407120	it introduced carbon pricing.
407120	410320	We had it for two years until a new government repealed it.
410960	413920	So Australians know better than most what life is like
413920	417120	before, during and after the so-called carbon tax.
418160	422800	Before carbon pricing was introduced, of course we had some justified fears
422800	424800	along with the usual scare stories.
425920	432160	In a story titled Carbon Tax Backlash, one local newspaper reported a justified fear
432160	435840	that one of Australia's top 500 carbon emitters would be hit
435840	439440	with a $2.5 million Australian dollar carbon bill.
439440	444880	The meat rendering company AJ Bush & Sons used 24,000 tonnes of coal a year
444880	449520	to heat its furnaces and dryers and over a million gigajoules of electricity.
450160	453360	Its wastewater was sent to ponds where they emitted methane,
453360	455440	further increasing their carbon liability.
456080	461280	Altogether, the company was releasing 100,000 tonnes a year of CO2 equivalents.
461920	467440	The newspaper reported that manager David Kasulke slammed the proposed carbon tax
467440	471440	and opposition politicians later toured the company, pledging to repeal it.
472320	476960	Opposition leader Tony Abbott said the carbon tax would swing like a wrecking ball
476960	478560	through the Australian economy.
479120	482480	And there was a dire prediction from Australian lobby groups.
482480	486160	And for that, the Australian government wants to bring the economy to its knees.
486160	488080	Say no to the carbon tax.
488080	492240	Of course, what the anti-tax lobbyists didn't say was that companies could reduce
492240	496640	their carbon liability by making themselves more energy efficient.
496640	497760	And that's what happened.
498720	503280	I noticed that myself within a few days of carbon pricing being introduced.
503280	506560	Our local supermarket began covering its cold food section
506560	508480	with thermal curtains during the night.
509120	513200	It had the same effect as if you'd been keeping your fridge door open every night
513200	515520	and then decided to keep it closed.
515520	520160	It cut their electricity bill and it cut their CO2 emissions
520160	523680	and it cut their carbon tax bill and that was the whole idea.
524560	528880	As for A.J. Bush and Sons, eight months after carbon pricing was introduced,
528880	531760	the same local newspaper reported on the company again.
532320	535520	This time with the headline, carbon tax turnaround.
536240	540240	The company had sought technical advice to reduce its carbon emissions.
540240	544480	It covered the wastewater ponds and captured the methane it was releasing
544480	546960	and then used that methane as a fuel source.
547600	550960	As a result, it reduced the amount of coal it needed by half.
551680	555440	It replaced the old boilers with newer, more energy efficient ones.
556000	559920	It installed solar panels and cut its electricity bill in half.
560960	564800	According to the local newspaper report, the manager of the company now says
564800	569360	that the taxes had a positive impact on the business and made it more competitive.
570080	572080	Not everyone did well, of course.
572080	575680	Many companies that were already struggling financially collapsed
575680	579360	during that two year period, partly because of carbon pricing.
579360	583680	But economists said that the carbon tax wasn't as big a factor in these closures
583680	585360	as the high Australian dollar.
586240	589360	And here's where the terminology becomes a bit fuzzy,
589360	594720	because the money from the carbon tax was actually used to cut income tax
594720	600400	and give a direct cash refund to householders to compensate for higher electricity prices
600400	606000	and provide subsidies for energy saving devices that cut electricity bills even further.
606000	610400	I managed to cut my electricity bill by two thirds during that two year period
610400	614560	and that was on top of the income tax cut and the refund I received.
615120	619760	But was the Australian economy brought to its knees, as the lobbyists had predicted?
620400	623680	Did it swing like a wrecking ball through the Australian economy?
624480	627680	No. In fact, most businesses boomed.
627680	633760	The ASX 200, Australia's equivalent of the Dow Jones Index, soared and the economy grew.
634320	639600	Even opposition leader Tony Abbott had to admit it hadn't been the catastrophe he had predicted.
640160	644800	So why did he repeal it after he became Prime Minister in 2014?
645520	649760	Well, it wasn't because the carbon tax had swung like a wrecking ball through the Australian
649760	655120	economy. And it wasn't because carbon pricing didn't succeed in making Australia more energy
655120	659680	efficient and bringing down CO2 emissions. And it couldn't have been the way the money
659680	664880	from carbon pricing was redistributed to consumers because all Abbott had to do to
664880	669280	instigate a more conservative solution was use all the revenue to cut taxes.
670160	675120	The reason he repealed it was because it was a Labour Party policy that he had opposed from
675120	681120	the start and he had staked his political career on repealing it even before it went into effect.
681760	684880	Party politics always triumphs over practicality.
684880	691200	A measure of the success of carbon pricing is that after it had been repealed, farmers,
691200	695520	bankers and business leaders were all asking for it to be brought back.
695520	700560	Australia's biggest energy producer Woodside is now calling for a carbon price.
700560	705120	It's a major reversal from the company's stance from several years ago when it campaigned against
705120	710320	the Gillard Government's emissions pricing scheme. Momentum is building among big industry for a
710320	716000	price on emissions with both BHP and Rio Tinto speaking out in the past fortnight in support of
716000	721840	one. The system favoured by Europe was to set a cap on the amount of carbon that could be emitted
721840	725520	and then sell permits to companies that wanted to exceed those limits.
726160	730480	Again, that's not very different to the way other industrial emissions are dealt with.
730480	735200	In the United States, for example, companies have to buy licenses to release waste products
735200	740320	into the atmosphere or the water supply and they get fined if they exceed those limits.
741120	744320	If some companies reduced their emissions below the cap,
744320	748480	they'd get carbon credits that could be sold to companies that were over the limits.
749360	754400	It's a bit like my garbage bin. There's a cap on the amount of garbage a bin can hold
754400	760720	and if I exceed that the local council won't take the bin. I have to pay for commercial disposal.
760720	765600	But if my neighbour has space in his bin, he lets me put my excess garbage in there.
766480	770720	But what would happen if a whole street full of people started trading these empty spaces
770720	775440	in their bins? The ones who have more than a bin full of waste could pay to put it in the
775440	780240	bins that have less. That's a lot cheaper than having it disposed off commercially
780240	785840	and everybody wins unless you think the local government has no business collecting waste anyway
785840	788160	and we should be free to dump it wherever we like.
788800	792640	So now there's a financial incentive to reduce garbage.
792640	797600	Entrepreneurs could start coming up with recycling or waste reducing technology.
797600	800320	And that's exactly what's happening in carbon trading.
800960	805040	I visited a carbon trading room in Sydney and it was very little different to metal
805040	810480	trading or stock trading rooms. The carbon price fluctuated according to supply and demand.
811280	815680	As European companies became more energy efficient in response to carbon pricing,
815680	822000	they didn't need to buy so many permits. CO2 emissions fell so fast that many European
822000	826640	countries met the Kyoto Protocol target, falling to below 1990 levels.
827520	834160	And much to the critics' surprise, CO2 emissions in the USA also fell, dropping to just 2% above
834160	841120	1990 levels in 2012, the final year of the Kyoto commitment period. Even though the USA never
841120	847280	ratified the protocol, many states decided to comply anyway and energy efficiency technologies
847280	854560	promoted in Europe were also adopted by American industry. But remember all those dire warnings
854560	860960	that CO2 emissions had to keep rising by 1.2% a year? That reducing them by 34% would cause
860960	867680	living standards to fall 15%? Well, as it turned out, living standards didn't fall at all. They
867680	873440	rose. None of the scare stories about economic devastation turned out to be anywhere near the
873440	880080	reality. Not all conservatives in the United States were lobbying against cuts in CO2.
880080	884640	As in Australia, many business leaders and companies were pressing for compliance with
884640	891280	the Kyoto Protocol. This open letter urged the US government to strengthen CO2 reduction targets,
891280	896880	saying it would not only reduce environmental damage but at the same time spur economic growth,
896880	902960	create new jobs, increase energy security and drive technological innovation. Among the
902960	910000	signatories? Whoops, someone called Donald J Trump and his family. In the days before the acceptance
910000	915360	of science became politically incorrect among extremists, this was something even the most
915360	922240	hardened political foes could agree on. Hi, I'm Nancy Pelosi, lifelong Democrat and speaker of
922240	927360	the House. And I'm Newt Gingrich, lifelong Republican and I used to be speaker. We don't
927360	934000	always see eye to eye, do we Newt? No, but we do agree our country must take action to address
934000	938960	climate change. We need cleaner forms of energy and we need them fast. If enough of us demand
938960	944640	action from our leaders, we can spark the innovation we need. Go to wecansolveit.org.
944640	950800	Together we can do this. Yeah, sorry if you just had your lunch, but what a promising time that
950800	956080	was. I'd almost forgotten we're running through the list of objections. Objection number five.
957120	961360	People in the global South... Our coal-generated plants stop people from starving, so yes,
961360	967520	it's partly a reason. And it's certainly the case that making energy more expensive obviously
967520	972560	makes things more difficult for poor people. Well, certainly electricity and transport stops people
972560	977040	from starving because at the moment we need a huge amount of power to produce ammonium-based
977040	983680	fertilizers and to get food from farms to cities. But neither power source has to be based on coal.
983680	988800	In fact, coal-based power has been in decline in industrialized countries and no one's going
988800	995440	hungry because of it. As for being cheaper, well that depends on circumstances. If we look at where
995440	1001280	most poor people live in developing countries, sometimes coal-fueled power is cheaper, sometimes
1001280	1006960	it's more expensive and not even available. Here are a few examples from first-hand experience.
1007600	1012480	Instead of motor pumps that need to be constantly repaired, maintained and fed with expensive
1012480	1017520	imported fossil fuels, some communities are turning to solar-powered electric pumps that
1017520	1023680	need little maintenance, rarely break down and cost very little to run. Remote villagers a long
1023680	1029120	way from the grid used to have to take batteries into town to be charged to run 12-volt fridges,
1029120	1035520	TVs and lights. Now they can use 12-volt mini-grids powered by solar panels. Other communities no
1035520	1041200	longer have to spend money maintaining and fixing generators and buying in diesel. They use solar
1041200	1047200	power. Millions of people now get their hot water from glass vacuum tubes invented by Huang Ming,
1047200	1052880	who I mentioned in part one. The tubes collect heat from the sun for free, doing away with the
1052880	1058960	daily chore of finding or buying wood and heating water on open fires. For some it's the first time
1058960	1064800	in their lives that they can bathe in hot water. These vacuum tubes can also be used for cooking.
1064800	1070960	The temperature inside gets as hot as an oven and can cook meat, vegetables or heat soup. A big one
1070960	1075840	can cook for several families. Again it means people no longer have to collect or pay money
1075840	1080880	for wood, which has been one of the main causes of forest denudation over the last few decades,
1080880	1088560	leading to mudslides and soil erosion. The diluteness problem is that, unlike coal or oil,
1088640	1094400	the sun and the wind don't deliver concentrated energy, which means you need a lot of additional
1094400	1100800	materials to produce a unit of energy. For solar power such materials can include highly purified
1100800	1107440	silicon, phosphorus, boron... But you need a lot of material to produce energy from fossil fuels too.
1107440	1112560	To build a coal-fired power station or an oil refinery you need iron and coking coal to make
1112560	1118640	the steel and nickel and aluminum and concrete and bricks and... Yes, all these materials also
1118640	1124720	have to be mined, refined and manufactured. And those industrial processes also take a lot of
1124720	1130800	energy. The advantage of solar and wind energy is that once it's up there it doesn't need a lot of
1130800	1136560	maintenance. By contrast, to keep a coal-fired power station going you need to continually dig
1136560	1141920	coal out of the ground and maintain the machinery that digs it out of the ground and transport it to
1141920	1146640	the power station and maintain the machines and infrastructure that transports it to the power
1146640	1153280	station. All of this takes resources and energy. But the best measure of how renewable energy makes
1153280	1159040	better use of resources is that it's already cheaper than coal-fired power in many places
1159040	1164560	and rapidly becoming even cheaper as economies of scale kick in and the technology improves.
1165120	1170000	Wind turbines are getting bigger and lighter. Solar panels are now being made so strong they
1170000	1175440	can support the weight of a car and so fluid you can fold them up or even paint them onto surfaces.
1176080	1181040	And let's not forget, wind and solar aren't the only forms of energy that don't add CO2 to the
1181040	1186240	atmosphere. The most obvious one is nuclear fission, which has been supplying France with
1186240	1191600	most of its power for decades. History has shown that nuclear power stations are much safer than
1191600	1197120	coal, as long as they're not run by Japanese companies. Then there are all the new technologies
1197120	1202720	whose impacts we haven't even begun to feel. New biofuels for transport are being developed,
1202720	1208000	not from sugars, specially grown in maize and sugarcane, but from cellulose, the stalks and
1208000	1213920	leaves and other by-products of crops that farmers discard. One of the technologies I've reported on
1213920	1219680	that best exemplifies the theme of these videos is a pilot plant in Taiwan that's taking waste
1219680	1226240	CO2 from a cement plant and using algae in sunlight to convert it into biofuel and astaxanthin.
1227120	1233280	Astaxanthin is an antioxidant and an expensive ingredient in cosmetics and food supplements,
1233280	1238560	so the pilot plant not only reduces CO2 emitted in the process of making cement,
1238560	1241920	which is one of the biggest emitters of carbon dioxide in the world,
1241920	1247120	you can make a profit out of it. I know that annoys some people, but like it or not,
1247120	1253520	making a solution profitable is the fastest way to get it adopted. Ask the public to sacrifice
1253520	1257760	their lifestyles or dig into their wallets for the sake of their fellow human beings,
1257760	1263920	and maybe a noble 5% of the population might do that. Make it profitable and everyone except the
1263920	1270080	most dim-witted will be on board. But I digress. Of course, coal and oil are more concentrated
1270080	1275600	forms of energy, and sometimes that's useful. In cars and planes, for example. But there's no
1275600	1282320	reason why renewable energy can't be concentrated also. In fact, it already is. As I showed in my
1282320	1288080	video Are Electric Cars Really Green, renewable energy can be concentrated in car batteries,
1288080	1294160	giving much better fuel mileage than gasoline cars. Renewable energy can also be converted
1294160	1300960	at source into hydrogen by electrolyzing water. Hydrogen cars already exist. Hydrogen-fuelled
1300960	1306640	machines can already do anything fossil fuel machines can do. A hydrogen-based electricity
1306640	1312000	grid could perform just as well as a coal-based one. The big difference is, burning hydrogen
1312000	1319840	doesn't produce CO2 or other unwanted byproducts, just water. So why hasn't it been adopted in a big
1319840	1326320	way? Well, it takes a lot of energy to make hydrogen from a plentiful source like seawater.
1326320	1331760	Using fossil fuels defeats the object of cutting carbon emissions. To get enough renewable energy
1331760	1337680	to do the job, you need a huge supply of reliable wind and solar energy. And the places you can get
1337680	1344240	that are usually a long way from populated areas where the hydrogen is needed. Hydrogen is a very
1344240	1350320	light gas, which means it's difficult and expensive to transport. But two recent breakthroughs have
1350320	1355600	changed all that. One is a method of adding nitrogen to hydrogen without the need for high
1355600	1361920	temperature and pressure, producing ammonia. Once you have ammonia, you basically have a safe liquid
1361920	1366640	transportation system for hydrogen. The other breakthrough is a method of converting that
1366640	1372240	ammonia back into hydrogen at the point where it's needed. So you can now produce ammonia wherever
1372240	1379280	you have three basic ingredients, water, nitrogen, and power. Water is abundant in the oceans,
1379280	1385680	nitrogen makes up most of the air, and solar power is plentiful in the deserts. Just to give an idea
1385680	1390960	of scale, how much desert you reckon would have to be covered with PV panels to satisfy the energy
1390960	1398560	needs of the entire world? Well, one researcher did a simple calculation, and the answer is just 1.2%
1398560	1404480	of the Sahara. That's about the size of the state of Gao in Mali. What this means is that our future
1404480	1410080	hydrogen energy map could look similar to the fossil fuel map, but instead of oil and gas
1410080	1415760	tankers heading to industrialized areas, there'd be ammonia tankers from Australia or Egypt,
1415760	1421520	filled with liquid renewable energy. Instead of pipelines taking oil from wells and shale beds,
1421520	1427760	we'd have pipelines taking ammonia from desert areas like Nevada or Texas. These are not my ideas,
1427760	1432640	these are proposals and projects now being tested by some of the world's largest multinational
1432640	1439760	companies. To those on the left who posted messages saying capitalism sucks, you're welcome to your
1439760	1445920	opinion. But these videos aren't trying to argue the merits of capitalism. Even if socialism had a
1445920	1450960	great track record on the environment, which it certainly doesn't, it's pointless suggesting that
1450960	1456320	the way American conservatives should address climate change is to stop being conservatives
1456320	1462560	and move to the left. That isn't going to happen. Like it or not, the United States is a capitalist
1462560	1468640	country, so as I said very clearly in part one, these videos are addressing conservatives who
1468640	1474160	accept the science and are looking for a way to tackle it through private enterprise. Because up
1474160	1479760	until now they've been told by extremists on both sides that any attempt to tackle climate change
1479760	1485200	is anti-capitalist. People who oppose technology and the human prosperity it brings with it
1485200	1489440	have been looking for any excuse to slow or even turn off the engine of the world.
1490080	1494720	So by staging demonstrations saying the only solution to climate change is to dismantle
1494720	1500160	capitalism, and by mixing calls for climate change action with other left-wing causes,
1500160	1504800	you're playing right into the hands of lobbyists who want to frighten people into believing that
1504800	1510880	anyone who accepts the science must be left-wing and want to bring down capitalism. I hope I've
1510880	1516560	shown that that clearly isn't the case. So to conservatives who do understand the science and
1516560	1522000	cringe at being associated with politicians who don't know how melting ice can raise sea levels...
1522960	1526320	Think about it, if your ice cube melts in your glass it doesn't overflow.
1526320	1532800	I feel your pain. But you have to stand up and be the voice of sanity rather than watch silently as
1532800	1539440	the remedial class still struggling to pass grade three science takes over. Because as voters become
1539440	1544640	more aware of the consequences of global warming and begin to understand the science and find that
1544640	1549360	their taxes are being raised to pay for hurricane compensation and they're paying higher taxes to
1549440	1554480	move infrastructure away from vulnerable coasts and they're being taxed to finance sea walls and
1554480	1558960	crop failures, they're not going to look for solutions from the political party that said...
1558960	1563680	I don't believe it. No, no, I don't believe it. They'll look for solutions from a political
1563680	1568800	party that's recognised the problem from the start. And contrary to the claims posted in
1568800	1575040	the forum of part one, of course conservatives accept regulations and incentives. It was a
1575120	1580640	staunch conservative, Richard Nixon, who set up the Environmental Protection Agency and signed
1580640	1585920	into law the National Environmental Policy Act, the Clean Air Act and instigated federal water
1585920	1591280	pollution control. Conservatives aren't in favour of no government, they want the minimum government
1591280	1595920	necessary to protect our rights and freedoms and private property. If you think you're a
1595920	1600240	conservative and you still don't understand that, then take a look at the National Republican
1600240	1607680	Party's policy platform issued in 2016. We affirm the inalienable rights of life, liberty and the
1607680	1613760	pursuit of happiness that government exists first and foremost to protect those inalienable rights.
1614720	1619440	In other words, no, you don't have the right to dump your pig waste in my water supply,
1619440	1624880	pollute my air and change my environment and if you do, the Republican Party says it's the
1624880	1631360	government's job to step in and stop it. How? Well, according to the Republican Party's platform,
1631360	1636960	we firmly believe environmental problems are best solved by giving incentives for human ingenuity
1636960	1642960	and the development of new technologies. Whether politicians are respecting these commitments or
1642960	1648880	are being totally hypocritical, well that's another matter. You have to decide whether you want to
1648880	1654640	follow them. If you want to support this channel, don't send money to me. I much prefer people
1654640	1659680	send money to a charity I list in the video description. So that concludes my foray into
1659680	1664480	the murky world of politics. We'll be back to dealing with misrepresentations of science
1664480	1667520	in the media from the next video. Thanks for watching.
