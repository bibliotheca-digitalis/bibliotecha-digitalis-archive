1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,760
Oh dear, part one of this video seems to have upset people on both sides of the political spectrum.

2
00:00:05,760 --> 00:00:08,000
I'll take a look at their comments later in the video.

3
00:00:08,640 --> 00:00:12,240
I'll also look at the Kyoto Protocol, explain cap and trade,

4
00:00:12,240 --> 00:00:17,280
and answer more objections to the exciting new technologies being offered by the free market

5
00:00:17,280 --> 00:00:18,960
to reduce CO2 emissions.

6
00:00:19,680 --> 00:00:25,840
Like part one, this video will also be opinion, based on sources cited in the video description.

7
00:00:25,840 --> 00:00:29,200
But after this, the channel will revert to its stated purpose

8
00:00:29,200 --> 00:00:32,400
of checking facts and busting junk science in the media.

9
00:00:33,360 --> 00:00:36,080
My premise in part one was pretty simple.

10
00:00:36,080 --> 00:00:40,480
I came to the conclusion in my early 20s that a totally free society,

11
00:00:40,480 --> 00:00:45,200
stripped of all government controls, is guided by this basic principle.

12
00:00:45,200 --> 00:00:48,400
That everyone is free to do whatever he or she wants,

13
00:00:48,400 --> 00:00:51,120
like start a pig farm or build a smelting plant,

14
00:00:51,120 --> 00:00:54,560
as long as that doesn't conflict with someone else's freedom,

15
00:00:54,560 --> 00:00:57,360
like drinking clean water or running a hotel.

16
00:00:58,080 --> 00:01:01,600
So protection of people's environment, business and property

17
00:01:01,600 --> 00:01:04,480
is a basic conservative and libertarian principle.

18
00:01:05,520 --> 00:01:10,320
So how can so many conservatives now believe this is purely a left-wing issue?

19
00:01:10,880 --> 00:01:13,120
Well, because that's what they've been told.

20
00:01:13,760 --> 00:01:17,600
People who oppose technology and the human prosperity it brings with it

21
00:01:17,600 --> 00:01:21,920
have been looking for any excuse to slow or even turn off the engine of the world.

22
00:01:22,640 --> 00:01:24,560
In the 1980s, they found it.

23
00:01:25,120 --> 00:01:26,080
Global warming.

24
00:01:26,960 --> 00:01:30,320
Since then, environmentalists, the media and Hollywood

25
00:01:30,320 --> 00:01:33,600
have worked to frighten the American people into accepting laws

26
00:01:33,600 --> 00:01:36,400
that restrict access to energy and raise its price.

27
00:01:37,520 --> 00:01:42,480
Fear of technology and an uncertain future created today's global warming movement.

28
00:01:42,480 --> 00:01:46,880
I hate to let facts get in the way of a good story, but as we saw in part one,

29
00:01:46,880 --> 00:01:51,680
it was a staunch conservative who first broadcast the message about climate change.

30
00:01:51,680 --> 00:01:54,080
No government had taken the issue seriously

31
00:01:54,080 --> 00:01:58,400
until Margaret Thatcher spread the message in a series of international speeches.

32
00:01:58,400 --> 00:02:02,720
I spoke about the global threat of climate change.

33
00:02:02,720 --> 00:02:07,600
Here's more from that speech describing Thatcher's vision of a conservative solution.

34
00:02:07,600 --> 00:02:13,840
Until recently, we've always thought that whatever progress humanity makes,

35
00:02:13,840 --> 00:02:16,000
our planet would stay much the same.

36
00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:18,640
That may no longer be true.

37
00:02:19,600 --> 00:02:23,120
The way we generate energy, the way we use land,

38
00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:27,600
the way industry uses natural resources and disposes of waste,

39
00:02:28,320 --> 00:02:30,720
the way our populations multiply,

40
00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:38,160
those things taken together are new in the experience of the earth.

41
00:02:39,520 --> 00:02:44,080
They threaten to change the atmosphere above us and the sea around us.

42
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:48,400
That is the scale of the global challenge.

43
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:53,760
We have to work to solve these problems on a sound scientific basis

44
00:02:53,760 --> 00:02:56,240
so that our remedies will be effective.

45
00:02:58,960 --> 00:03:02,160
So if you're an American conservative who accepts the science

46
00:03:02,160 --> 00:03:06,480
but has been scared into believing that the only solution is Marxist world government.

47
00:03:06,480 --> 00:03:10,720
They are about to impose a communist world government on the world.

48
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:14,480
Or even if you're just going along with the climate change is a hoax stuff

49
00:03:14,480 --> 00:03:18,400
because you've been told it's the politically correct position you're supposed to hold,

50
00:03:18,960 --> 00:03:21,280
then I hope this video will show otherwise.

51
00:03:21,920 --> 00:03:23,520
So continuing on from part one,

52
00:03:23,520 --> 00:03:27,120
let's look at more objections from people who call themselves conservatives.

53
00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:32,640
In 1997, the biggest per capita emitters of carbon dioxide

54
00:03:32,640 --> 00:03:39,120
agreed at Kyoto to get their CO2 emissions back to below 1990 levels by 2012.

55
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:44,960
Of the eligible countries, only the United States and Australia didn't sign up,

56
00:03:44,960 --> 00:03:47,280
although Australia did so a few years later.

57
00:03:47,920 --> 00:03:53,040
Campaigning by a fossil fuel industry lobby group called the Global Climate Coalition

58
00:03:53,040 --> 00:03:56,480
and political organisations like the Heritage Foundation

59
00:03:56,480 --> 00:04:00,480
convinced American politicians that such drastic cuts would be

60
00:04:00,480 --> 00:04:05,680
economically devastating and risk the economic security of future generations.

61
00:04:06,240 --> 00:04:11,200
A 1997 pamphlet by the Heritage Foundation aimed at members of Congress

62
00:04:11,200 --> 00:04:13,600
claimed the Kyoto Protocol would

63
00:04:13,600 --> 00:04:16,400
retired economic production every year,

64
00:04:16,400 --> 00:04:22,880
result in a 3.3 trillion dollar loss of income between 2001 and 2020.

65
00:04:22,880 --> 00:04:28,640
There are some who'd like for us to imagine a world without coal-based electricity.

66
00:04:28,640 --> 00:04:31,600
Okay then, let's see what that would look like.

67
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:36,160
Without coal-based power plants, we wouldn't have reliable electricity.

68
00:04:36,160 --> 00:04:38,480
Electricity prices would rise,

69
00:04:38,480 --> 00:04:40,960
local communities would lose jobs,

70
00:04:40,960 --> 00:04:43,760
and our national economy would suffer.

71
00:04:43,760 --> 00:04:47,440
So yes, we can imagine a world without coal,

72
00:04:47,440 --> 00:04:49,520
and it's a pretty scary place to be.

73
00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:53,360
Three years later, the lobbying was aimed at President Bush.

74
00:04:54,080 --> 00:04:58,880
Again, the Heritage Foundation warned of devastating economic consequences

75
00:04:58,880 --> 00:05:02,560
if the US cut its carbon emissions in line with the Kyoto Protocol.

76
00:05:03,280 --> 00:05:08,880
For the economy to keep growing, CO2 emissions would have to rise by 1.2% a year.

77
00:05:08,880 --> 00:05:13,600
That would be around 34% above 1990 levels by 2010.

78
00:05:14,560 --> 00:05:16,320
So the United States stayed out.

79
00:05:17,280 --> 00:05:21,520
Everyone else went ahead anyway and tried to meet the reduction targets in two ways.

80
00:05:22,240 --> 00:05:27,120
The first was carbon pricing, which lobbyists labelled a carbon tax.

81
00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:30,880
It's based on the old established principle that the polluter pays,

82
00:05:30,880 --> 00:05:34,160
whether it's pig waste, sulphur dioxide, or CO2.

83
00:05:35,040 --> 00:05:39,360
If you want to say, but carbon dioxide isn't a pollutant, it's essential for life.

84
00:05:40,160 --> 00:05:41,120
Carbon dioxide.

85
00:05:42,080 --> 00:05:43,040
They call it pollution.

86
00:05:44,640 --> 00:05:45,520
We call it life.

87
00:05:46,160 --> 00:05:47,760
Well, so is calcium.

88
00:05:47,760 --> 00:05:48,560
So is water.

89
00:05:49,200 --> 00:05:53,600
That still doesn't give you the right to dump a load of cement in my backyard

90
00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:56,560
or divert water from your property onto my property.

91
00:05:57,200 --> 00:06:00,800
As long as you're putting something in the air, the water, or on land

92
00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:04,400
that's adversely affecting my property and my environment,

93
00:06:04,400 --> 00:06:08,080
then whether you want to call it pollution or an unwanted gift,

94
00:06:08,080 --> 00:06:11,440
you're infringing on my freedom and my property rights.

95
00:06:12,640 --> 00:06:15,840
I read a lot of comments from people who are scared of carbon pricing

96
00:06:15,840 --> 00:06:19,120
without even understanding what it is or how it would affect them.

97
00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:22,800
Carbon pricing is new and a bit mysterious.

98
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:27,200
But the term carbon tax, well, that's more snappy and more familiar.

99
00:06:27,920 --> 00:06:30,640
Everyone understands what a tax is, right?

100
00:06:30,640 --> 00:06:32,640
It means you have to pay money to the government.

101
00:06:33,280 --> 00:06:35,120
Well, not quite.

102
00:06:35,120 --> 00:06:38,720
I'm happy to use the term as long as people understand what it means.

103
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:45,200
When my adopted country, Australia, finally ratified the Kyoto Protocol in 2012,

104
00:06:45,200 --> 00:06:47,120
it introduced carbon pricing.

105
00:06:47,120 --> 00:06:50,320
We had it for two years until a new government repealed it.

106
00:06:50,960 --> 00:06:53,920
So Australians know better than most what life is like

107
00:06:53,920 --> 00:06:57,120
before, during and after the so-called carbon tax.

108
00:06:58,160 --> 00:07:02,800
Before carbon pricing was introduced, of course we had some justified fears

109
00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:04,800
along with the usual scare stories.

110
00:07:05,920 --> 00:07:12,160
In a story titled Carbon Tax Backlash, one local newspaper reported a justified fear

111
00:07:12,160 --> 00:07:15,840
that one of Australia's top 500 carbon emitters would be hit

112
00:07:15,840 --> 00:07:19,440
with a $2.5 million Australian dollar carbon bill.

113
00:07:19,440 --> 00:07:24,880
The meat rendering company AJ Bush & Sons used 24,000 tonnes of coal a year

114
00:07:24,880 --> 00:07:29,520
to heat its furnaces and dryers and over a million gigajoules of electricity.

115
00:07:30,160 --> 00:07:33,360
Its wastewater was sent to ponds where they emitted methane,

116
00:07:33,360 --> 00:07:35,440
further increasing their carbon liability.

117
00:07:36,080 --> 00:07:41,280
Altogether, the company was releasing 100,000 tonnes a year of CO2 equivalents.

118
00:07:41,920 --> 00:07:47,440
The newspaper reported that manager David Kasulke slammed the proposed carbon tax

119
00:07:47,440 --> 00:07:51,440
and opposition politicians later toured the company, pledging to repeal it.

120
00:07:52,320 --> 00:07:56,960
Opposition leader Tony Abbott said the carbon tax would swing like a wrecking ball

121
00:07:56,960 --> 00:07:58,560
through the Australian economy.

122
00:07:59,120 --> 00:08:02,480
And there was a dire prediction from Australian lobby groups.

123
00:08:02,480 --> 00:08:06,160
And for that, the Australian government wants to bring the economy to its knees.

124
00:08:06,160 --> 00:08:08,080
Say no to the carbon tax.

125
00:08:08,080 --> 00:08:12,240
Of course, what the anti-tax lobbyists didn't say was that companies could reduce

126
00:08:12,240 --> 00:08:16,640
their carbon liability by making themselves more energy efficient.

127
00:08:16,640 --> 00:08:17,760
And that's what happened.

128
00:08:18,720 --> 00:08:23,280
I noticed that myself within a few days of carbon pricing being introduced.

129
00:08:23,280 --> 00:08:26,560
Our local supermarket began covering its cold food section

130
00:08:26,560 --> 00:08:28,480
with thermal curtains during the night.

131
00:08:29,120 --> 00:08:33,200
It had the same effect as if you'd been keeping your fridge door open every night

132
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:35,520
and then decided to keep it closed.

133
00:08:35,520 --> 00:08:40,160
It cut their electricity bill and it cut their CO2 emissions

134
00:08:40,160 --> 00:08:43,680
and it cut their carbon tax bill and that was the whole idea.

135
00:08:44,560 --> 00:08:48,880
As for A.J. Bush and Sons, eight months after carbon pricing was introduced,

136
00:08:48,880 --> 00:08:51,760
the same local newspaper reported on the company again.

137
00:08:52,320 --> 00:08:55,520
This time with the headline, carbon tax turnaround.

138
00:08:56,240 --> 00:09:00,240
The company had sought technical advice to reduce its carbon emissions.

139
00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:04,480
It covered the wastewater ponds and captured the methane it was releasing

140
00:09:04,480 --> 00:09:06,960
and then used that methane as a fuel source.

141
00:09:07,600 --> 00:09:10,960
As a result, it reduced the amount of coal it needed by half.

142
00:09:11,680 --> 00:09:15,440
It replaced the old boilers with newer, more energy efficient ones.

143
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:19,920
It installed solar panels and cut its electricity bill in half.

144
00:09:20,960 --> 00:09:24,800
According to the local newspaper report, the manager of the company now says

145
00:09:24,800 --> 00:09:29,360
that the taxes had a positive impact on the business and made it more competitive.

146
00:09:30,080 --> 00:09:32,080
Not everyone did well, of course.

147
00:09:32,080 --> 00:09:35,680
Many companies that were already struggling financially collapsed

148
00:09:35,680 --> 00:09:39,360
during that two year period, partly because of carbon pricing.

149
00:09:39,360 --> 00:09:43,680
But economists said that the carbon tax wasn't as big a factor in these closures

150
00:09:43,680 --> 00:09:45,360
as the high Australian dollar.

151
00:09:46,240 --> 00:09:49,360
And here's where the terminology becomes a bit fuzzy,

152
00:09:49,360 --> 00:09:54,720
because the money from the carbon tax was actually used to cut income tax

153
00:09:54,720 --> 00:10:00,400
and give a direct cash refund to householders to compensate for higher electricity prices

154
00:10:00,400 --> 00:10:06,000
and provide subsidies for energy saving devices that cut electricity bills even further.

155
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:10,400
I managed to cut my electricity bill by two thirds during that two year period

156
00:10:10,400 --> 00:10:14,560
and that was on top of the income tax cut and the refund I received.

157
00:10:15,120 --> 00:10:19,760
But was the Australian economy brought to its knees, as the lobbyists had predicted?

158
00:10:20,400 --> 00:10:23,680
Did it swing like a wrecking ball through the Australian economy?

159
00:10:24,480 --> 00:10:27,680
No. In fact, most businesses boomed.

160
00:10:27,680 --> 00:10:33,760
The ASX 200, Australia's equivalent of the Dow Jones Index, soared and the economy grew.

161
00:10:34,320 --> 00:10:39,600
Even opposition leader Tony Abbott had to admit it hadn't been the catastrophe he had predicted.

162
00:10:40,160 --> 00:10:44,800
So why did he repeal it after he became Prime Minister in 2014?

163
00:10:45,520 --> 00:10:49,760
Well, it wasn't because the carbon tax had swung like a wrecking ball through the Australian

164
00:10:49,760 --> 00:10:55,120
economy. And it wasn't because carbon pricing didn't succeed in making Australia more energy

165
00:10:55,120 --> 00:10:59,680
efficient and bringing down CO2 emissions. And it couldn't have been the way the money

166
00:10:59,680 --> 00:11:04,880
from carbon pricing was redistributed to consumers because all Abbott had to do to

167
00:11:04,880 --> 00:11:09,280
instigate a more conservative solution was use all the revenue to cut taxes.

168
00:11:10,160 --> 00:11:15,120
The reason he repealed it was because it was a Labour Party policy that he had opposed from

169
00:11:15,120 --> 00:11:21,120
the start and he had staked his political career on repealing it even before it went into effect.

170
00:11:21,760 --> 00:11:24,880
Party politics always triumphs over practicality.

171
00:11:24,880 --> 00:11:31,200
A measure of the success of carbon pricing is that after it had been repealed, farmers,

172
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:35,520
bankers and business leaders were all asking for it to be brought back.

173
00:11:35,520 --> 00:11:40,560
Australia's biggest energy producer Woodside is now calling for a carbon price.

174
00:11:40,560 --> 00:11:45,120
It's a major reversal from the company's stance from several years ago when it campaigned against

175
00:11:45,120 --> 00:11:50,320
the Gillard Government's emissions pricing scheme. Momentum is building among big industry for a

176
00:11:50,320 --> 00:11:56,000
price on emissions with both BHP and Rio Tinto speaking out in the past fortnight in support of

177
00:11:56,000 --> 00:12:01,840
one. The system favoured by Europe was to set a cap on the amount of carbon that could be emitted

178
00:12:01,840 --> 00:12:05,520
and then sell permits to companies that wanted to exceed those limits.

179
00:12:06,160 --> 00:12:10,480
Again, that's not very different to the way other industrial emissions are dealt with.

180
00:12:10,480 --> 00:12:15,200
In the United States, for example, companies have to buy licenses to release waste products

181
00:12:15,200 --> 00:12:20,320
into the atmosphere or the water supply and they get fined if they exceed those limits.

182
00:12:21,120 --> 00:12:24,320
If some companies reduced their emissions below the cap,

183
00:12:24,320 --> 00:12:28,480
they'd get carbon credits that could be sold to companies that were over the limits.

184
00:12:29,360 --> 00:12:34,400
It's a bit like my garbage bin. There's a cap on the amount of garbage a bin can hold

185
00:12:34,400 --> 00:12:40,720
and if I exceed that the local council won't take the bin. I have to pay for commercial disposal.

186
00:12:40,720 --> 00:12:45,600
But if my neighbour has space in his bin, he lets me put my excess garbage in there.

187
00:12:46,480 --> 00:12:50,720
But what would happen if a whole street full of people started trading these empty spaces

188
00:12:50,720 --> 00:12:55,440
in their bins? The ones who have more than a bin full of waste could pay to put it in the

189
00:12:55,440 --> 00:13:00,240
bins that have less. That's a lot cheaper than having it disposed off commercially

190
00:13:00,240 --> 00:13:05,840
and everybody wins unless you think the local government has no business collecting waste anyway

191
00:13:05,840 --> 00:13:08,160
and we should be free to dump it wherever we like.

192
00:13:08,800 --> 00:13:12,640
So now there's a financial incentive to reduce garbage.

193
00:13:12,640 --> 00:13:17,600
Entrepreneurs could start coming up with recycling or waste reducing technology.

194
00:13:17,600 --> 00:13:20,320
And that's exactly what's happening in carbon trading.

195
00:13:20,960 --> 00:13:25,040
I visited a carbon trading room in Sydney and it was very little different to metal

196
00:13:25,040 --> 00:13:30,480
trading or stock trading rooms. The carbon price fluctuated according to supply and demand.

197
00:13:31,280 --> 00:13:35,680
As European companies became more energy efficient in response to carbon pricing,

198
00:13:35,680 --> 00:13:42,000
they didn't need to buy so many permits. CO2 emissions fell so fast that many European

199
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:46,640
countries met the Kyoto Protocol target, falling to below 1990 levels.

200
00:13:47,520 --> 00:13:54,160
And much to the critics' surprise, CO2 emissions in the USA also fell, dropping to just 2% above

201
00:13:54,160 --> 00:14:01,120
1990 levels in 2012, the final year of the Kyoto commitment period. Even though the USA never

202
00:14:01,120 --> 00:14:07,280
ratified the protocol, many states decided to comply anyway and energy efficiency technologies

203
00:14:07,280 --> 00:14:14,560
promoted in Europe were also adopted by American industry. But remember all those dire warnings

204
00:14:14,560 --> 00:14:20,960
that CO2 emissions had to keep rising by 1.2% a year? That reducing them by 34% would cause

205
00:14:20,960 --> 00:14:27,680
living standards to fall 15%? Well, as it turned out, living standards didn't fall at all. They

206
00:14:27,680 --> 00:14:33,440
rose. None of the scare stories about economic devastation turned out to be anywhere near the

207
00:14:33,440 --> 00:14:40,080
reality. Not all conservatives in the United States were lobbying against cuts in CO2.

208
00:14:40,080 --> 00:14:44,640
As in Australia, many business leaders and companies were pressing for compliance with

209
00:14:44,640 --> 00:14:51,280
the Kyoto Protocol. This open letter urged the US government to strengthen CO2 reduction targets,

210
00:14:51,280 --> 00:14:56,880
saying it would not only reduce environmental damage but at the same time spur economic growth,

211
00:14:56,880 --> 00:15:02,960
create new jobs, increase energy security and drive technological innovation. Among the

212
00:15:02,960 --> 00:15:10,000
signatories? Whoops, someone called Donald J Trump and his family. In the days before the acceptance

213
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:15,360
of science became politically incorrect among extremists, this was something even the most

214
00:15:15,360 --> 00:15:22,240
hardened political foes could agree on. Hi, I'm Nancy Pelosi, lifelong Democrat and speaker of

215
00:15:22,240 --> 00:15:27,360
the House. And I'm Newt Gingrich, lifelong Republican and I used to be speaker. We don't

216
00:15:27,360 --> 00:15:34,000
always see eye to eye, do we Newt? No, but we do agree our country must take action to address

217
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:38,960
climate change. We need cleaner forms of energy and we need them fast. If enough of us demand

218
00:15:38,960 --> 00:15:44,640
action from our leaders, we can spark the innovation we need. Go to wecansolveit.org.

219
00:15:44,640 --> 00:15:50,800
Together we can do this. Yeah, sorry if you just had your lunch, but what a promising time that

220
00:15:50,800 --> 00:15:56,080
was. I'd almost forgotten we're running through the list of objections. Objection number five.

221
00:15:57,120 --> 00:16:01,360
People in the global South... Our coal-generated plants stop people from starving, so yes,

222
00:16:01,360 --> 00:16:07,520
it's partly a reason. And it's certainly the case that making energy more expensive obviously

223
00:16:07,520 --> 00:16:12,560
makes things more difficult for poor people. Well, certainly electricity and transport stops people

224
00:16:12,560 --> 00:16:17,040
from starving because at the moment we need a huge amount of power to produce ammonium-based

225
00:16:17,040 --> 00:16:23,680
fertilizers and to get food from farms to cities. But neither power source has to be based on coal.

226
00:16:23,680 --> 00:16:28,800
In fact, coal-based power has been in decline in industrialized countries and no one's going

227
00:16:28,800 --> 00:16:35,440
hungry because of it. As for being cheaper, well that depends on circumstances. If we look at where

228
00:16:35,440 --> 00:16:41,280
most poor people live in developing countries, sometimes coal-fueled power is cheaper, sometimes

229
00:16:41,280 --> 00:16:46,960
it's more expensive and not even available. Here are a few examples from first-hand experience.

230
00:16:47,600 --> 00:16:52,480
Instead of motor pumps that need to be constantly repaired, maintained and fed with expensive

231
00:16:52,480 --> 00:16:57,520
imported fossil fuels, some communities are turning to solar-powered electric pumps that

232
00:16:57,520 --> 00:17:03,680
need little maintenance, rarely break down and cost very little to run. Remote villagers a long

233
00:17:03,680 --> 00:17:09,120
way from the grid used to have to take batteries into town to be charged to run 12-volt fridges,

234
00:17:09,120 --> 00:17:15,520
TVs and lights. Now they can use 12-volt mini-grids powered by solar panels. Other communities no

235
00:17:15,520 --> 00:17:21,200
longer have to spend money maintaining and fixing generators and buying in diesel. They use solar

236
00:17:21,200 --> 00:17:27,200
power. Millions of people now get their hot water from glass vacuum tubes invented by Huang Ming,

237
00:17:27,200 --> 00:17:32,880
who I mentioned in part one. The tubes collect heat from the sun for free, doing away with the

238
00:17:32,880 --> 00:17:38,960
daily chore of finding or buying wood and heating water on open fires. For some it's the first time

239
00:17:38,960 --> 00:17:44,800
in their lives that they can bathe in hot water. These vacuum tubes can also be used for cooking.

240
00:17:44,800 --> 00:17:50,960
The temperature inside gets as hot as an oven and can cook meat, vegetables or heat soup. A big one

241
00:17:50,960 --> 00:17:55,840
can cook for several families. Again it means people no longer have to collect or pay money

242
00:17:55,840 --> 00:18:00,880
for wood, which has been one of the main causes of forest denudation over the last few decades,

243
00:18:00,880 --> 00:18:08,560
leading to mudslides and soil erosion. The diluteness problem is that, unlike coal or oil,

244
00:18:08,640 --> 00:18:14,400
the sun and the wind don't deliver concentrated energy, which means you need a lot of additional

245
00:18:14,400 --> 00:18:20,800
materials to produce a unit of energy. For solar power such materials can include highly purified

246
00:18:20,800 --> 00:18:27,440
silicon, phosphorus, boron... But you need a lot of material to produce energy from fossil fuels too.

247
00:18:27,440 --> 00:18:32,560
To build a coal-fired power station or an oil refinery you need iron and coking coal to make

248
00:18:32,560 --> 00:18:38,640
the steel and nickel and aluminum and concrete and bricks and... Yes, all these materials also

249
00:18:38,640 --> 00:18:44,720
have to be mined, refined and manufactured. And those industrial processes also take a lot of

250
00:18:44,720 --> 00:18:50,800
energy. The advantage of solar and wind energy is that once it's up there it doesn't need a lot of

251
00:18:50,800 --> 00:18:56,560
maintenance. By contrast, to keep a coal-fired power station going you need to continually dig

252
00:18:56,560 --> 00:19:01,920
coal out of the ground and maintain the machinery that digs it out of the ground and transport it to

253
00:19:01,920 --> 00:19:06,640
the power station and maintain the machines and infrastructure that transports it to the power

254
00:19:06,640 --> 00:19:13,280
station. All of this takes resources and energy. But the best measure of how renewable energy makes

255
00:19:13,280 --> 00:19:19,040
better use of resources is that it's already cheaper than coal-fired power in many places

256
00:19:19,040 --> 00:19:24,560
and rapidly becoming even cheaper as economies of scale kick in and the technology improves.

257
00:19:25,120 --> 00:19:30,000
Wind turbines are getting bigger and lighter. Solar panels are now being made so strong they

258
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:35,440
can support the weight of a car and so fluid you can fold them up or even paint them onto surfaces.

259
00:19:36,080 --> 00:19:41,040
And let's not forget, wind and solar aren't the only forms of energy that don't add CO2 to the

260
00:19:41,040 --> 00:19:46,240
atmosphere. The most obvious one is nuclear fission, which has been supplying France with

261
00:19:46,240 --> 00:19:51,600
most of its power for decades. History has shown that nuclear power stations are much safer than

262
00:19:51,600 --> 00:19:57,120
coal, as long as they're not run by Japanese companies. Then there are all the new technologies

263
00:19:57,120 --> 00:20:02,720
whose impacts we haven't even begun to feel. New biofuels for transport are being developed,

264
00:20:02,720 --> 00:20:08,000
not from sugars, specially grown in maize and sugarcane, but from cellulose, the stalks and

265
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:13,920
leaves and other by-products of crops that farmers discard. One of the technologies I've reported on

266
00:20:13,920 --> 00:20:19,680
that best exemplifies the theme of these videos is a pilot plant in Taiwan that's taking waste

267
00:20:19,680 --> 00:20:26,240
CO2 from a cement plant and using algae in sunlight to convert it into biofuel and astaxanthin.

268
00:20:27,120 --> 00:20:33,280
Astaxanthin is an antioxidant and an expensive ingredient in cosmetics and food supplements,

269
00:20:33,280 --> 00:20:38,560
so the pilot plant not only reduces CO2 emitted in the process of making cement,

270
00:20:38,560 --> 00:20:41,920
which is one of the biggest emitters of carbon dioxide in the world,

271
00:20:41,920 --> 00:20:47,120
you can make a profit out of it. I know that annoys some people, but like it or not,

272
00:20:47,120 --> 00:20:53,520
making a solution profitable is the fastest way to get it adopted. Ask the public to sacrifice

273
00:20:53,520 --> 00:20:57,760
their lifestyles or dig into their wallets for the sake of their fellow human beings,

274
00:20:57,760 --> 00:21:03,920
and maybe a noble 5% of the population might do that. Make it profitable and everyone except the

275
00:21:03,920 --> 00:21:10,080
most dim-witted will be on board. But I digress. Of course, coal and oil are more concentrated

276
00:21:10,080 --> 00:21:15,600
forms of energy, and sometimes that's useful. In cars and planes, for example. But there's no

277
00:21:15,600 --> 00:21:22,320
reason why renewable energy can't be concentrated also. In fact, it already is. As I showed in my

278
00:21:22,320 --> 00:21:28,080
video Are Electric Cars Really Green, renewable energy can be concentrated in car batteries,

279
00:21:28,080 --> 00:21:34,160
giving much better fuel mileage than gasoline cars. Renewable energy can also be converted

280
00:21:34,160 --> 00:21:40,960
at source into hydrogen by electrolyzing water. Hydrogen cars already exist. Hydrogen-fuelled

281
00:21:40,960 --> 00:21:46,640
machines can already do anything fossil fuel machines can do. A hydrogen-based electricity

282
00:21:46,640 --> 00:21:52,000
grid could perform just as well as a coal-based one. The big difference is, burning hydrogen

283
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:59,840
doesn't produce CO2 or other unwanted byproducts, just water. So why hasn't it been adopted in a big

284
00:21:59,840 --> 00:22:06,320
way? Well, it takes a lot of energy to make hydrogen from a plentiful source like seawater.

285
00:22:06,320 --> 00:22:11,760
Using fossil fuels defeats the object of cutting carbon emissions. To get enough renewable energy

286
00:22:11,760 --> 00:22:17,680
to do the job, you need a huge supply of reliable wind and solar energy. And the places you can get

287
00:22:17,680 --> 00:22:24,240
that are usually a long way from populated areas where the hydrogen is needed. Hydrogen is a very

288
00:22:24,240 --> 00:22:30,320
light gas, which means it's difficult and expensive to transport. But two recent breakthroughs have

289
00:22:30,320 --> 00:22:35,600
changed all that. One is a method of adding nitrogen to hydrogen without the need for high

290
00:22:35,600 --> 00:22:41,920
temperature and pressure, producing ammonia. Once you have ammonia, you basically have a safe liquid

291
00:22:41,920 --> 00:22:46,640
transportation system for hydrogen. The other breakthrough is a method of converting that

292
00:22:46,640 --> 00:22:52,240
ammonia back into hydrogen at the point where it's needed. So you can now produce ammonia wherever

293
00:22:52,240 --> 00:22:59,280
you have three basic ingredients, water, nitrogen, and power. Water is abundant in the oceans,

294
00:22:59,280 --> 00:23:05,680
nitrogen makes up most of the air, and solar power is plentiful in the deserts. Just to give an idea

295
00:23:05,680 --> 00:23:10,960
of scale, how much desert you reckon would have to be covered with PV panels to satisfy the energy

296
00:23:10,960 --> 00:23:18,560
needs of the entire world? Well, one researcher did a simple calculation, and the answer is just 1.2%

297
00:23:18,560 --> 00:23:24,480
of the Sahara. That's about the size of the state of Gao in Mali. What this means is that our future

298
00:23:24,480 --> 00:23:30,080
hydrogen energy map could look similar to the fossil fuel map, but instead of oil and gas

299
00:23:30,080 --> 00:23:35,760
tankers heading to industrialized areas, there'd be ammonia tankers from Australia or Egypt,

300
00:23:35,760 --> 00:23:41,520
filled with liquid renewable energy. Instead of pipelines taking oil from wells and shale beds,

301
00:23:41,520 --> 00:23:47,760
we'd have pipelines taking ammonia from desert areas like Nevada or Texas. These are not my ideas,

302
00:23:47,760 --> 00:23:52,640
these are proposals and projects now being tested by some of the world's largest multinational

303
00:23:52,640 --> 00:23:59,760
companies. To those on the left who posted messages saying capitalism sucks, you're welcome to your

304
00:23:59,760 --> 00:24:05,920
opinion. But these videos aren't trying to argue the merits of capitalism. Even if socialism had a

305
00:24:05,920 --> 00:24:10,960
great track record on the environment, which it certainly doesn't, it's pointless suggesting that

306
00:24:10,960 --> 00:24:16,320
the way American conservatives should address climate change is to stop being conservatives

307
00:24:16,320 --> 00:24:22,560
and move to the left. That isn't going to happen. Like it or not, the United States is a capitalist

308
00:24:22,560 --> 00:24:28,640
country, so as I said very clearly in part one, these videos are addressing conservatives who

309
00:24:28,640 --> 00:24:34,160
accept the science and are looking for a way to tackle it through private enterprise. Because up

310
00:24:34,160 --> 00:24:39,760
until now they've been told by extremists on both sides that any attempt to tackle climate change

311
00:24:39,760 --> 00:24:45,200
is anti-capitalist. People who oppose technology and the human prosperity it brings with it

312
00:24:45,200 --> 00:24:49,440
have been looking for any excuse to slow or even turn off the engine of the world.

313
00:24:50,080 --> 00:24:54,720
So by staging demonstrations saying the only solution to climate change is to dismantle

314
00:24:54,720 --> 00:25:00,160
capitalism, and by mixing calls for climate change action with other left-wing causes,

315
00:25:00,160 --> 00:25:04,800
you're playing right into the hands of lobbyists who want to frighten people into believing that

316
00:25:04,800 --> 00:25:10,880
anyone who accepts the science must be left-wing and want to bring down capitalism. I hope I've

317
00:25:10,880 --> 00:25:16,560
shown that that clearly isn't the case. So to conservatives who do understand the science and

318
00:25:16,560 --> 00:25:22,000
cringe at being associated with politicians who don't know how melting ice can raise sea levels...

319
00:25:22,960 --> 00:25:26,320
Think about it, if your ice cube melts in your glass it doesn't overflow.

320
00:25:26,320 --> 00:25:32,800
I feel your pain. But you have to stand up and be the voice of sanity rather than watch silently as

321
00:25:32,800 --> 00:25:39,440
the remedial class still struggling to pass grade three science takes over. Because as voters become

322
00:25:39,440 --> 00:25:44,640
more aware of the consequences of global warming and begin to understand the science and find that

323
00:25:44,640 --> 00:25:49,360
their taxes are being raised to pay for hurricane compensation and they're paying higher taxes to

324
00:25:49,440 --> 00:25:54,480
move infrastructure away from vulnerable coasts and they're being taxed to finance sea walls and

325
00:25:54,480 --> 00:25:58,960
crop failures, they're not going to look for solutions from the political party that said...

326
00:25:58,960 --> 00:26:03,680
I don't believe it. No, no, I don't believe it. They'll look for solutions from a political

327
00:26:03,680 --> 00:26:08,800
party that's recognised the problem from the start. And contrary to the claims posted in

328
00:26:08,800 --> 00:26:15,040
the forum of part one, of course conservatives accept regulations and incentives. It was a

329
00:26:15,120 --> 00:26:20,640
staunch conservative, Richard Nixon, who set up the Environmental Protection Agency and signed

330
00:26:20,640 --> 00:26:25,920
into law the National Environmental Policy Act, the Clean Air Act and instigated federal water

331
00:26:25,920 --> 00:26:31,280
pollution control. Conservatives aren't in favour of no government, they want the minimum government

332
00:26:31,280 --> 00:26:35,920
necessary to protect our rights and freedoms and private property. If you think you're a

333
00:26:35,920 --> 00:26:40,240
conservative and you still don't understand that, then take a look at the National Republican

334
00:26:40,240 --> 00:26:47,680
Party's policy platform issued in 2016. We affirm the inalienable rights of life, liberty and the

335
00:26:47,680 --> 00:26:53,760
pursuit of happiness that government exists first and foremost to protect those inalienable rights.

336
00:26:54,720 --> 00:26:59,440
In other words, no, you don't have the right to dump your pig waste in my water supply,

337
00:26:59,440 --> 00:27:04,880
pollute my air and change my environment and if you do, the Republican Party says it's the

338
00:27:04,880 --> 00:27:11,360
government's job to step in and stop it. How? Well, according to the Republican Party's platform,

339
00:27:11,360 --> 00:27:16,960
we firmly believe environmental problems are best solved by giving incentives for human ingenuity

340
00:27:16,960 --> 00:27:22,960
and the development of new technologies. Whether politicians are respecting these commitments or

341
00:27:22,960 --> 00:27:28,880
are being totally hypocritical, well that's another matter. You have to decide whether you want to

342
00:27:28,880 --> 00:27:34,640
follow them. If you want to support this channel, don't send money to me. I much prefer people

343
00:27:34,640 --> 00:27:39,680
send money to a charity I list in the video description. So that concludes my foray into

344
00:27:39,680 --> 00:27:44,480
the murky world of politics. We'll be back to dealing with misrepresentations of science

345
00:27:44,480 --> 00:27:47,520
in the media from the next video. Thanks for watching.
