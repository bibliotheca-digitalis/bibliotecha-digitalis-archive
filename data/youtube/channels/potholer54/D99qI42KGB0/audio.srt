1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,480
I want to address all sides of the ideological spectrum for a moment and hope we can all

2
00:00:04,480 --> 00:00:06,880
agree on a few facts.

3
00:00:06,880 --> 00:00:11,960
Over the last 200 years, surely we can agree that coal and oil have taken the world from

4
00:00:11,960 --> 00:00:17,800
a patchwork of backward rural economies through the Industrial Revolution into the modern

5
00:00:17,800 --> 00:00:18,800
age.

6
00:00:18,800 --> 00:00:24,560
I used to work as a geologist on oil exploration rigs in the Mediterranean and the North Sea,

7
00:00:24,560 --> 00:00:30,960
and help find the fossil fuels that have given you and me all the comforts we now enjoy.

8
00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:34,920
Like it or not, that is the economic reality.

9
00:00:34,920 --> 00:00:39,640
But we also have to acknowledge the fact that burning these fuels has caused problems like

10
00:00:39,640 --> 00:00:45,200
pollution, bad health, and above all raised the level of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere

11
00:00:45,200 --> 00:00:48,520
to the point at which it's causing global warming.

12
00:00:48,520 --> 00:00:52,640
Like it or not, that's the scientific reality.

13
00:00:52,640 --> 00:00:56,760
We're led to believe that the two sides of this debate are those who say the only way

14
00:00:56,760 --> 00:01:01,960
to deal with anthropogenic climate change is to dismantle the capitalist system, and

15
00:01:01,960 --> 00:01:04,680
those who want to pretend it's all a hoax.

16
00:01:04,680 --> 00:01:09,800
I think the majority of sensible people would like to deal with the problem and support

17
00:01:09,800 --> 00:01:12,160
the free market system.

18
00:01:12,160 --> 00:01:16,480
Normally I wouldn't tackle a subject like this, but I need to address the messages I

19
00:01:16,480 --> 00:01:23,140
get every time I make a video about science, suggesting that accepting science is an indication

20
00:01:23,140 --> 00:01:29,400
that I must be left-wing, as if all conservatives must be scientifically illiterate, or that

21
00:01:29,400 --> 00:01:33,120
science and capitalism are incompatible.

22
00:01:33,120 --> 00:01:37,840
So forgive me for spending a couple of videos on how climate science relates to the world

23
00:01:37,840 --> 00:01:39,880
of politics and economics.

24
00:01:39,880 --> 00:01:41,920
I'll put that away.

25
00:01:41,920 --> 00:01:44,420
This whole video is my opinion.

26
00:01:44,420 --> 00:01:48,980
But it's going to be an opinion based on facts, and as always, my sources are cited

27
00:01:48,980 --> 00:01:50,980
in the video description.

28
00:01:50,980 --> 00:01:57,100
I want to show why I think science, a healthy environment, and free enterprise are all essential

29
00:01:57,100 --> 00:02:02,180
elements of our democratic way of life, and I want you to meet some of the entrepreneurs

30
00:02:02,180 --> 00:02:09,100
and inventors I've met as a science reporter who are leading an energy revolution.

31
00:02:09,100 --> 00:02:13,920
But first, how did climate science suddenly become a political issue?

32
00:02:13,920 --> 00:02:17,800
After all, the link between carbon dioxide and temperature has been accepted by research

33
00:02:17,800 --> 00:02:24,920
scientists since it was first discovered in 1896 and confirmed in the 1940s.

34
00:02:24,920 --> 00:02:30,600
But the problem was largely confined to the scientific community, until a visionary politician,

35
00:02:30,600 --> 00:02:36,480
who really understood the science, spoke out on the world stage, and for the first time

36
00:02:36,480 --> 00:02:39,200
gave us this stark warning.

37
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:44,360
I spoke about the global threat of climate change.

38
00:02:44,360 --> 00:02:48,720
I set out the magnitude of the challenge we face.

39
00:02:48,720 --> 00:02:55,360
Until recently, we've always thought that whatever progress humanity makes, our planet

40
00:02:55,360 --> 00:02:58,300
would stay much the same.

41
00:02:58,300 --> 00:02:59,840
That may no longer be true.

42
00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:06,840
Next month, I shall be going to the United Nations to set out our view on how the world

43
00:03:06,880 --> 00:03:09,640
should tackle climate change.

44
00:03:09,640 --> 00:03:14,880
We've proposed a global convention, a sort of good conduct guide to the environment for

45
00:03:14,880 --> 00:03:19,320
all the world's nations, on problems like the greenhouse effect.

46
00:03:19,320 --> 00:03:25,320
Britain has taken the lead internationally, and we shall continue to do so.

47
00:03:25,320 --> 00:03:32,320
Yes, it was a staunch conservative, the Iron Lady herself, who gave a series of speeches

48
00:03:32,320 --> 00:03:38,080
on global warming 17 years before Al Gore turned it into a movie.

49
00:03:38,080 --> 00:03:42,960
To those who say Margaret Thatcher later rescinded her position, no, she didn't.

50
00:03:42,960 --> 00:03:47,640
She has a degree in analytical chemistry, so she was no dummy.

51
00:03:47,640 --> 00:03:50,020
She never contradicted the science.

52
00:03:50,020 --> 00:03:55,760
What she criticized was the way climate change was being used by a few extremists as an excuse

53
00:03:55,760 --> 00:03:58,760
to attack the capitalist system.

54
00:03:58,760 --> 00:04:02,880
The problem is that in the United States, powerful lobby groups have taken this to mean

55
00:04:02,880 --> 00:04:08,280
that anyone who accepts the science must therefore be a member of this nutty anti-capitalist

56
00:04:08,280 --> 00:04:10,480
fringe group.

57
00:04:10,480 --> 00:04:14,920
That's why there's very little room in the USA for the voices of intelligent, free-thinking

58
00:04:14,920 --> 00:04:18,720
conservatives who do accept the science.

59
00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:23,800
If you want to carve out a career as a conservative pundit in the USA, you have to repeat the

60
00:04:23,800 --> 00:04:26,440
politically correct talking points.

61
00:04:26,440 --> 00:04:29,120
The idea that the Arctic ice is disappearing is nonsense.

62
00:04:29,120 --> 00:04:32,460
The idea that the hockey stick graph is anything remotely resembling reality.

63
00:04:32,460 --> 00:04:35,600
That's why they call it climate change now and not global warming because the Earth basically

64
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:36,960
has not been warming for the last 15 years or so.

65
00:04:36,960 --> 00:04:39,800
OK, I'm not here to debunk all these internet myths.

66
00:04:39,800 --> 00:04:43,660
I've done that in previous videos, and so have many others.

67
00:04:43,660 --> 00:04:49,100
It's not hard to fact-check, so there has to be a reason why Ben Shapiro is so willing

68
00:04:49,100 --> 00:04:50,840
to repeat these myths.

69
00:04:50,840 --> 00:04:55,480
Well, what Shapiro says next gives us a very revealing clue.

70
00:04:55,480 --> 00:05:00,680
All of which is to say, if you could come up with a solution that did not hurt millions

71
00:05:00,680 --> 00:05:05,240
of people and plunge us back into the 1850s, then maybe we could talk about it.

72
00:05:05,240 --> 00:05:08,640
So it's not really the science Ben has a problem with.

73
00:05:08,640 --> 00:05:13,360
It's his fear that those who accept the link between CO2 and global temperature have some

74
00:05:13,360 --> 00:05:17,680
sort of agenda and want to plunge us back to the 1850s.

75
00:05:17,680 --> 00:05:22,940
So he's only willing to accept the science if there's an acceptable solution.

76
00:05:22,940 --> 00:05:23,940
And he's not alone.

77
00:05:23,940 --> 00:05:29,740
China, India, US factories, cars, coal energy plants, and hummers, not those hummers, are

78
00:05:29,740 --> 00:05:33,020
generating only 3% of the Earth's CO2.

79
00:05:33,020 --> 00:05:36,940
Again, I've already shown why this particular fallacy is wrong.

80
00:05:36,940 --> 00:05:40,500
It even made it onto my list of top ten climate myths.

81
00:05:40,500 --> 00:05:42,900
So that's not the point here.

82
00:05:42,900 --> 00:05:48,900
Far more interesting is why Penn Jillette feels the need to regurgitate myths like this.

83
00:05:48,900 --> 00:05:51,660
And in more pensive mood, he tells us.

84
00:05:51,660 --> 00:05:55,300
I am not sure that all the tenets of global warming are true.

85
00:05:55,300 --> 00:05:57,980
It seems pretty likely things are getting warmer.

86
00:05:57,980 --> 00:06:01,100
Seems pretty likely it was anthropogenic in some way.

87
00:06:01,100 --> 00:06:05,740
But then there comes this whole bill of goods that it has to be done by conservation, it

88
00:06:05,740 --> 00:06:09,460
has to be done by government intervention, it has to be all this stuff.

89
00:06:09,460 --> 00:06:13,020
And I was just saying that the whole package I didn't know about.

90
00:06:13,020 --> 00:06:18,260
So as with Ben Shapiro, it's not really the science Penn has a problem with.

91
00:06:18,260 --> 00:06:22,860
He's only copying the politically correct talking points because he thinks the solution

92
00:06:22,860 --> 00:06:25,140
is more government control.

93
00:06:25,140 --> 00:06:27,260
We'll see why they think that in part two.

94
00:06:27,260 --> 00:06:31,820
But in the rest of the world, conservatives have no problem accepting climate science

95
00:06:31,820 --> 00:06:34,440
and free market solutions.

96
00:06:34,440 --> 00:06:38,060
Even ten of the world's biggest oil and gas companies accept it.

97
00:06:38,060 --> 00:06:43,100
They say they're gearing themselves up for what they see as a huge transition into renewable

98
00:06:43,100 --> 00:06:44,700
energy.

99
00:06:44,700 --> 00:06:50,100
So what are these conservatives seeing that a lot of American conservatives aren't?

100
00:06:50,100 --> 00:06:54,540
I figured out long ago that humans work most efficiently when we're free to do what we

101
00:06:54,540 --> 00:06:55,540
like.

102
00:06:55,540 --> 00:07:00,820
So let me be a voice that both extremes may not have heard before, belonging to the majority

103
00:07:00,820 --> 00:07:06,460
of people who don't think scientific facts and a healthy environment and free enterprise

104
00:07:06,460 --> 00:07:08,400
are incompatible.

105
00:07:08,400 --> 00:07:10,660
Let me explain my thinking.

106
00:07:10,660 --> 00:07:15,980
In my 20s, I began to formulate my idea of a government-free society, which went like

107
00:07:15,980 --> 00:07:16,980
this.

108
00:07:16,980 --> 00:07:21,980
Imagine an island called Fredonia, not owned by any country.

109
00:07:21,980 --> 00:07:27,740
People in search of freedom staked their claim and settled there and agreed on just one rule.

110
00:07:27,740 --> 00:07:33,420
Everyone has the freedom to do whatever he or she wants – own guns, smoke dope, start

111
00:07:33,420 --> 00:07:36,220
a pig farm, anything.

112
00:07:36,220 --> 00:07:40,540
But of course, if someone starts a pig farm in his backyard, that could pollute the water

113
00:07:40,540 --> 00:07:42,920
his neighbours use for drinking.

114
00:07:42,920 --> 00:07:48,080
So the inhabitants of Fredonia had to come together again to qualify the rule.

115
00:07:48,080 --> 00:07:53,140
Everyone has the freedom to do whatever he or she wants, as long as it doesn't infringe

116
00:07:53,140 --> 00:07:56,000
on the freedom of others.

117
00:07:56,000 --> 00:08:01,860
So I have the freedom to dump garbage in the ocean from my private beach if I want to.

118
00:08:01,860 --> 00:08:06,300
But if that garbage ends up on my neighbour's private beach or affects the number of fish

119
00:08:06,300 --> 00:08:11,840
caught by an enterprising fisherman, then I'm infringing on their freedoms, their property

120
00:08:11,840 --> 00:08:14,220
rights and business rights.

121
00:08:14,220 --> 00:08:19,340
This is such a basic principle of conservatism, why is it so many conservatives caught up

122
00:08:19,340 --> 00:08:23,100
in the climate debate have forgotten it?

123
00:08:23,100 --> 00:08:27,600
In the real world, when something impinges on people's freedom like this, society finds

124
00:08:27,600 --> 00:08:33,020
a way round it by setting targets to mitigate the problem, which encourages technological

125
00:08:33,020 --> 00:08:36,600
innovation and free market solutions.

126
00:08:36,600 --> 00:08:41,300
For example, when leaded gasoline infringed on a child's freedom to grow up without brain

127
00:08:41,300 --> 00:08:46,860
impairment, the solution wasn't to ban cars or claim the researchers were faking their

128
00:08:46,860 --> 00:08:53,540
data, it was to phase out lead in gasoline and let the free market come up with an alternative.

129
00:08:53,540 --> 00:08:55,460
Which of course it did.

130
00:08:55,460 --> 00:08:59,780
The same thing happened with CFCs used in aerosol sprays that were breaking down the

131
00:08:59,780 --> 00:09:01,340
ozone layer.

132
00:09:01,340 --> 00:09:06,640
There was a rather feeble attempt to discredit scientists and claim it was all a hoax, but

133
00:09:06,640 --> 00:09:12,460
society accepted the science and the free market came up with alternatives.

134
00:09:12,460 --> 00:09:16,980
The point is that none of these innovations would have come about if we'd taken the attitude

135
00:09:16,980 --> 00:09:24,180
of Ben Shapiro, that you only recognise a problem if someone first comes up with a solution.

136
00:09:24,180 --> 00:09:28,460
Free enterprise doesn't work like that, it's the other way round.

137
00:09:28,460 --> 00:09:33,700
Science recognises a problem, and then companies spend time and money coming up with a solution

138
00:09:33,700 --> 00:09:35,540
to fix it.

139
00:09:35,540 --> 00:09:39,940
As I said, I'll tackle these fears about plunging us back to the 1850s and greater government

140
00:09:39,940 --> 00:09:45,420
control in part two, but let's first look at a few other objections to the move towards

141
00:09:45,420 --> 00:09:50,860
CO2 reduction, starting with the President of the United States, who thinks the Chinese

142
00:09:50,860 --> 00:09:56,020
government invented global warming in order to trick the US into spending billions of

143
00:09:56,020 --> 00:09:59,260
dollars fixing a problem that doesn't exist.

144
00:09:59,260 --> 00:10:04,460
Meanwhile, he says, the Chinese themselves are spending nothing, giving them a competitive

145
00:10:04,460 --> 00:10:05,980
edge.

146
00:10:05,980 --> 00:10:09,740
The reality is the polar opposite.

147
00:10:09,740 --> 00:10:12,940
First of all, clearly China didn't invent global warming.

148
00:10:12,940 --> 00:10:18,500
The link between CO2 and global temperature has been known about for 120 years.

149
00:10:18,500 --> 00:10:23,860
And far from doing nothing, China is now leading this energy revolution.

150
00:10:23,860 --> 00:10:28,900
Over the last seven years, China has been the world's biggest producer and consumer

151
00:10:28,900 --> 00:10:31,660
of renewable energy.

152
00:10:31,660 --> 00:10:36,900
It's also the biggest investor in renewable energy research and manufacturing.

153
00:10:36,900 --> 00:10:43,140
In 2016, China accounted for more new solar thermal and onshore wind power than the United

154
00:10:43,140 --> 00:10:45,780
States and Europe put together.

155
00:10:45,780 --> 00:10:52,180
In 2017, it produced twice as much renewable power as the United States.

156
00:10:52,180 --> 00:10:56,620
Scientists on the left and on the right who claim this move to clean energy is incompatible

157
00:10:56,620 --> 00:11:02,180
with capitalism should try telling that to Chinese entrepreneurs like Huang Ming, a solar

158
00:11:02,180 --> 00:11:04,060
energy billionaire.

159
00:11:04,060 --> 00:11:09,980
He made his fortune manufacturing solar thermal tubes and built this huge research and manufacturing

160
00:11:09,980 --> 00:11:14,020
hub known as Solar Valley, south of Beijing.

161
00:11:14,020 --> 00:11:19,620
I spent three days here doing a profile on Huang Ming and he was dismissive of the claims

162
00:11:19,620 --> 00:11:24,380
that capitalism is incompatible with good environmental practice.

163
00:11:24,380 --> 00:11:29,780
China is investing in renewable energy not to save the planet, but because it makes economic

164
00:11:29,780 --> 00:11:30,780
sense.

165
00:11:30,780 --> 00:11:36,500
Rising sea levels, a lack of water from glacial melt, increasing droughts and floods and stronger

166
00:11:36,500 --> 00:11:42,220
typhoons, regardless of whether POTUS thinks the Chinese made it all up, these things threaten

167
00:11:42,220 --> 00:11:45,300
China's future economic progress.

168
00:11:45,300 --> 00:11:50,060
And since the United States government has decided to opt out, China is more than happy

169
00:11:50,060 --> 00:11:57,240
to take the economic and technological lead in the energy revolution we're already seeing.

170
00:11:57,240 --> 00:12:02,040
So ironically, the expenditure of billions of dollars in renewable energy that President

171
00:12:02,040 --> 00:12:08,140
Trump was worried would cripple US factories is instead being spent in China, where factories

172
00:12:08,140 --> 00:12:09,920
are humming.

173
00:12:09,920 --> 00:12:14,860
Five of the world's six top solar panel manufacturers and five of the largest wind turbine

174
00:12:14,860 --> 00:12:18,180
manufacturers are now Chinese-owned.

175
00:12:18,180 --> 00:12:23,700
Their manufacturing drive and technological edge enables Chinese companies to sell solar

176
00:12:23,700 --> 00:12:29,860
panels, solar thermal tubes, batteries, electric bikes and wind turbines all over the world

177
00:12:29,860 --> 00:12:32,660
and dominate those markets.

178
00:12:32,660 --> 00:12:38,260
According to a report by the Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis, as

179
00:12:38,260 --> 00:12:43,620
the global transition towards renewables gains pace and as battery storage and electric vehicle

180
00:12:43,620 --> 00:12:48,980
technologies pick up momentum, China is setting itself to dominate these sectors globally

181
00:12:48,980 --> 00:12:52,460
over the next few decades of this century.

182
00:12:52,460 --> 00:12:57,780
Critics say these industries are only growing because renewable energy is subsidised.

183
00:12:57,780 --> 00:13:00,140
Without the subsidies, it would be uncompetitive.

184
00:13:00,140 --> 00:13:03,380
Well, of course, it is subsidised.

185
00:13:03,380 --> 00:13:06,540
That's the basic principle of Fredonia.

186
00:13:06,540 --> 00:13:11,740
When an industry does harm to the environment, it should be discouraged and entrepreneurs

187
00:13:11,740 --> 00:13:15,780
should be encouraged to come up with solutions.

188
00:13:15,780 --> 00:13:20,140
It's no good arguing that if renewable energy was profitable, it would have happened without

189
00:13:20,140 --> 00:13:21,140
subsidies.

190
00:13:21,140 --> 00:13:26,260
The plain fact is it didn't, for the simple reason that for over a century we already

191
00:13:26,260 --> 00:13:30,300
had a profitable source of energy, coal and oil.

192
00:13:30,300 --> 00:13:35,180
If fossil fuels were producing electricity cheaper than solar panels and wind turbines,

193
00:13:35,180 --> 00:13:40,100
who in their right mind would want to switch to the latter as a source of energy or invest

194
00:13:40,100 --> 00:13:42,060
in it?

195
00:13:42,060 --> 00:13:46,540
But all you need to do to alter that balance is to take tax breaks away from the coal and

196
00:13:46,540 --> 00:13:51,340
oil industries and switch the money to the renewable power industry.

197
00:13:51,340 --> 00:13:56,340
All it takes is to make solar and wind marginally cheaper in some areas, and all of a sudden

198
00:13:56,340 --> 00:13:58,140
you have a market.

199
00:13:58,140 --> 00:14:03,340
And once there's a market for a product, economies of scale kick in and the product gets cheaper

200
00:14:03,340 --> 00:14:04,660
still.

201
00:14:04,660 --> 00:14:08,700
And a market for a product means money is ploughed into research, making the product

202
00:14:08,700 --> 00:14:10,460
more efficient.

203
00:14:10,460 --> 00:14:15,200
As it gets cheaper, the subsidies can be lowered and eventually removed altogether.

204
00:14:15,200 --> 00:14:18,460
And that's exactly what's happened with wind and solar.

205
00:14:18,460 --> 00:14:24,260
Over the last ten years, the cost of manufacturing solar panels and wind turbines has plunged,

206
00:14:24,260 --> 00:14:27,500
slashing the price of the electricity they produce.

207
00:14:27,500 --> 00:14:33,020
At the same time, their efficiency has increased, making them even more competitive.

208
00:14:33,020 --> 00:14:39,080
As the price falls, many countries have reduced or eliminated subsidies altogether.

209
00:14:39,080 --> 00:14:43,960
Electricity from renewables is now so cheap that even the coal museum in Virginia decided

210
00:14:43,960 --> 00:14:46,780
to install solar panels.

211
00:14:46,780 --> 00:14:52,520
According to a 2017 report by the International Renewable Energy Agency, increasingly the

212
00:14:52,520 --> 00:14:58,420
technology is competing head-to-head with conventional power sources, and doing so without

213
00:14:58,420 --> 00:15:01,460
financial support.

214
00:15:01,460 --> 00:15:05,900
Question number three comes from Alex Epstein, author of the book, The Moral Case for Fossil

215
00:15:05,900 --> 00:15:06,960
Fuels.

216
00:15:06,960 --> 00:15:11,040
This isn't exactly a newsflash, but the sun doesn't shine all the time.

217
00:15:11,040 --> 00:15:12,980
And the wind doesn't blow all the time.

218
00:15:12,980 --> 00:15:18,220
The only way for solar and wind to be truly useful would be if we could store them, so

219
00:15:18,220 --> 00:15:20,580
that they would be available when we needed them.

220
00:15:20,580 --> 00:15:23,680
The windmills are wonderful, but you know, when the wind doesn't blow, they really do

221
00:15:23,680 --> 00:15:26,000
cause problems.

222
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:27,500
We have no energy this week.

223
00:15:27,780 --> 00:15:31,980
Hopefully the wind will start blowing pretty soon.

224
00:15:31,980 --> 00:15:37,200
It's hard to believe that this is the same nation that was once respected, even revered,

225
00:15:37,200 --> 00:15:41,760
for having a can-do attitude that built a railroad across a continent, and put a man

226
00:15:41,760 --> 00:15:43,320
on the moon.

227
00:15:43,320 --> 00:15:48,360
When faced with a problem, past generations of Americans didn't just give up, they looked

228
00:15:48,360 --> 00:15:50,520
for solutions.

229
00:15:50,520 --> 00:15:54,360
American know-how and ingenuity was the envy of the world.

230
00:15:54,360 --> 00:15:58,640
These days the attitude of, what can we do when the wind doesn't blow, means it's mostly

231
00:15:58,640 --> 00:16:03,700
other countries that are rolling up their sleeves and finding solutions.

232
00:16:03,700 --> 00:16:07,720
The intermittency problem doesn't just mean that sometimes you don't get any energy from

233
00:16:07,720 --> 00:16:12,720
wind and solar, it also means you sometimes get too much.

234
00:16:12,720 --> 00:16:17,400
Wind energy is so plentiful in China, that when I was in Beijing a few years ago, the

235
00:16:17,400 --> 00:16:21,600
country had to shut down a third of its wind turbines in the north, because it couldn't

236
00:16:21,600 --> 00:16:24,520
use all the electricity they were producing.

237
00:16:24,520 --> 00:16:26,880
And I discovered that this is commonplace.

238
00:16:26,880 --> 00:16:32,080
Germany sometimes produces so much electricity from renewables that the price falls to below

239
00:16:32,080 --> 00:16:33,280
zero.

240
00:16:33,280 --> 00:16:38,640
In other words, plant operators have to pay consumers to use it.

241
00:16:38,640 --> 00:16:42,640
So what's needed is an efficient way of storing this excess.

242
00:16:42,640 --> 00:16:44,960
You can store oil in a tank.

243
00:16:44,960 --> 00:16:47,380
Where do you store solar or wind energy?

244
00:16:47,380 --> 00:16:49,880
No such mass storage system exists.

245
00:16:49,880 --> 00:16:54,000
Which is like saying, we need to get to the moon in a rocket, but we can't do it because

246
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:56,640
no such rocket exists.

247
00:16:56,640 --> 00:17:01,400
Or we have to build a railroad across America, but it can't be done because there are mountains

248
00:17:01,400 --> 00:17:02,400
in the way.

249
00:17:02,400 --> 00:17:07,300
Come on, Americans, how far would the USA have got in the past with that attitude?

250
00:17:07,300 --> 00:17:12,200
If mass storage systems don't exist, roll up your sleeves and invent them.

251
00:17:12,200 --> 00:17:17,760
Then hey presto, you get things that do exist, like this huge battery now feeding the grid

252
00:17:17,760 --> 00:17:19,560
in South Australia.

253
00:17:19,560 --> 00:17:24,760
Or in Wales, where excess electricity is pumped up to a reservoir, then runs back down through

254
00:17:24,760 --> 00:17:28,160
turbines when renewables don't perform.

255
00:17:28,160 --> 00:17:33,080
In Switzerland, compressed air is pumped into a sealed cave when there's too much electricity

256
00:17:33,080 --> 00:17:37,440
and then released to drive turbines when there's not enough.

257
00:17:37,440 --> 00:17:42,640
Energy can be stored in flywheels or as molten salt, which stays hot long enough to continue

258
00:17:42,640 --> 00:17:47,480
driving turbines for eight hours after the sun's gone down, long enough to meet peak

259
00:17:47,480 --> 00:17:49,240
demand.

260
00:17:49,240 --> 00:17:53,520
Some excess energy is used to split water molecules to produce hydrogen, which can be

261
00:17:53,520 --> 00:17:57,080
turned back into energy through combustion.

262
00:17:57,080 --> 00:18:01,360
Of course, you can whine and moan that some of these systems have problems, but you know

263
00:18:01,360 --> 00:18:02,920
what to do.

264
00:18:02,920 --> 00:18:05,840
Roll up your sleeves and find solutions.

265
00:18:05,840 --> 00:18:09,140
If you don't do it, your competitors will.

266
00:18:09,140 --> 00:18:13,140
For example, lithium-ion batteries are fine, but like everything else, they need to be

267
00:18:13,140 --> 00:18:15,840
made cheaper and more efficient.

268
00:18:15,840 --> 00:18:20,880
Last year I went to a research institute in Taiwan to meet an engineer who did just

269
00:18:20,880 --> 00:18:21,880
that.

270
00:18:21,880 --> 00:18:26,900
The battery his team developed is made of aluminum – lighter, cheaper, and longer

271
00:18:26,900 --> 00:18:33,400
lasting than lithium-ion batteries – and it can be recharged in just a few minutes.

272
00:18:33,400 --> 00:18:38,000
Another problem is that there's a shortage of places where water can be pumped into reservoirs.

273
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:45,040
Okay, find a solution to that too, like using heavy weights on rails instead of water.

274
00:18:45,040 --> 00:18:49,880
This system, by the way, was developed in the USA because some states are defying Washington's

275
00:18:49,880 --> 00:18:53,200
drive to go back to coal.

276
00:18:53,200 --> 00:18:57,640
If you haven't got the message by now, you won't find solutions to a problem by pretending

277
00:18:57,640 --> 00:19:00,040
the problem doesn't exist.

278
00:19:00,040 --> 00:19:04,040
And you won't do it by whining that the solution doesn't exist.

279
00:19:04,040 --> 00:19:08,600
And you won't do it either by blaming capitalism and demanding that we go back to living in

280
00:19:08,600 --> 00:19:09,600
caves.

281
00:19:09,600 --> 00:19:15,440
Environmental problems get solved by recognising a problem, setting common goals to eliminate

282
00:19:15,440 --> 00:19:20,400
it, and letting free enterprise and competition find the solution.

283
00:19:20,400 --> 00:19:24,280
In part two of this video I look at how the Kyoto Protocol has fared.

284
00:19:24,280 --> 00:19:28,920
Did it bankrupt us, or did it actually succeed in reducing CO2 emissions?

285
00:19:28,920 --> 00:19:32,080
I'll talk about my visit to a carbon trading room.

286
00:19:32,080 --> 00:19:35,540
How's carbon trading different to a carbon tax?

287
00:19:35,540 --> 00:19:40,020
The Australian government wants to bring the economy to its knees, say no to the carbon

288
00:19:40,020 --> 00:19:41,020
tax.

289
00:19:41,020 --> 00:19:46,620
And what happened to Australia when it first introduced and later dropped the carbon tax?

290
00:19:46,620 --> 00:19:51,580
And I'll have more on the exciting technological advances that are not only bringing us cleaner

291
00:19:51,580 --> 00:19:55,860
energy, but also more efficient energy use.

292
00:19:55,860 --> 00:20:01,140
Plus how to take CO2 out of the air and sell it for a profit.

293
00:20:01,140 --> 00:20:05,820
But before I go, listen to this clip from President Carter when he inaugurated a solar

294
00:20:05,820 --> 00:20:09,660
water heater on the roof of the White House in 1979.

295
00:20:09,660 --> 00:20:17,820
A generation from now this solar heater can either be a curiosity, a museum piece, an

296
00:20:17,820 --> 00:20:26,240
example of a road not taken, or it can be just a small part of one of the greatest and

297
00:20:26,240 --> 00:20:31,180
most exciting adventures ever undertaken by the American people.

298
00:20:31,180 --> 00:20:37,080
If America had embarked on that journey in 1979 instead of 1997, which is when the rest

299
00:20:37,080 --> 00:20:42,160
of the world started that journey after the Kyoto Protocol, we'd be 20 years ahead of

300
00:20:42,160 --> 00:20:43,900
where we are now.

301
00:20:43,900 --> 00:20:49,760
We would have had competitive solar and wind power by 1999, and today we'd already be seeing

302
00:20:49,760 --> 00:20:55,080
the drastic cuts in carbon dioxide that are planned for 2040.

303
00:20:55,080 --> 00:21:00,180
And it would be America, not China, with the technological lead selling these products

304
00:21:00,180 --> 00:21:02,600
to the rest of the world.

305
00:21:02,600 --> 00:21:08,320
But when Ronald Reagan came to office, the White House solar water heater was taken down.

306
00:21:08,320 --> 00:21:09,320
Where is it now?

307
00:21:09,320 --> 00:21:12,160
Well, Carter's words were prophetic.

308
00:21:12,160 --> 00:21:18,280
A museum piece, an example of a road not taken.

309
00:21:18,280 --> 00:21:23,800
To be precise, it's in Huang Ming's solar museum in Solar Valley.

310
00:21:23,800 --> 00:21:29,800
An example of the road America didn't take and still won't take, but along which China

311
00:21:29,800 --> 00:21:31,840
is more than happy to lead the way.
