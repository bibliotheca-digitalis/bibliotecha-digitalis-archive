0	4480	I want to address all sides of the ideological spectrum for a moment and hope we can all
4480	6880	agree on a few facts.
6880	11960	Over the last 200 years, surely we can agree that coal and oil have taken the world from
11960	17800	a patchwork of backward rural economies through the Industrial Revolution into the modern
17800	18800	age.
18800	24560	I used to work as a geologist on oil exploration rigs in the Mediterranean and the North Sea,
24560	30960	and help find the fossil fuels that have given you and me all the comforts we now enjoy.
30960	34920	Like it or not, that is the economic reality.
34920	39640	But we also have to acknowledge the fact that burning these fuels has caused problems like
39640	45200	pollution, bad health, and above all raised the level of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere
45200	48520	to the point at which it's causing global warming.
48520	52640	Like it or not, that's the scientific reality.
52640	56760	We're led to believe that the two sides of this debate are those who say the only way
56760	61960	to deal with anthropogenic climate change is to dismantle the capitalist system, and
61960	64680	those who want to pretend it's all a hoax.
64680	69800	I think the majority of sensible people would like to deal with the problem and support
69800	72160	the free market system.
72160	76480	Normally I wouldn't tackle a subject like this, but I need to address the messages I
76480	83140	get every time I make a video about science, suggesting that accepting science is an indication
83140	89400	that I must be left-wing, as if all conservatives must be scientifically illiterate, or that
89400	93120	science and capitalism are incompatible.
93120	97840	So forgive me for spending a couple of videos on how climate science relates to the world
97840	99880	of politics and economics.
99880	101920	I'll put that away.
101920	104420	This whole video is my opinion.
104420	108980	But it's going to be an opinion based on facts, and as always, my sources are cited
108980	110980	in the video description.
110980	117100	I want to show why I think science, a healthy environment, and free enterprise are all essential
117100	122180	elements of our democratic way of life, and I want you to meet some of the entrepreneurs
122180	129100	and inventors I've met as a science reporter who are leading an energy revolution.
129100	133920	But first, how did climate science suddenly become a political issue?
133920	137800	After all, the link between carbon dioxide and temperature has been accepted by research
137800	144920	scientists since it was first discovered in 1896 and confirmed in the 1940s.
144920	150600	But the problem was largely confined to the scientific community, until a visionary politician,
150600	156480	who really understood the science, spoke out on the world stage, and for the first time
156480	159200	gave us this stark warning.
159200	164360	I spoke about the global threat of climate change.
164360	168720	I set out the magnitude of the challenge we face.
168720	175360	Until recently, we've always thought that whatever progress humanity makes, our planet
175360	178300	would stay much the same.
178300	179840	That may no longer be true.
179840	186840	Next month, I shall be going to the United Nations to set out our view on how the world
186880	189640	should tackle climate change.
189640	194880	We've proposed a global convention, a sort of good conduct guide to the environment for
194880	199320	all the world's nations, on problems like the greenhouse effect.
199320	205320	Britain has taken the lead internationally, and we shall continue to do so.
205320	212320	Yes, it was a staunch conservative, the Iron Lady herself, who gave a series of speeches
212320	218080	on global warming 17 years before Al Gore turned it into a movie.
218080	222960	To those who say Margaret Thatcher later rescinded her position, no, she didn't.
222960	227640	She has a degree in analytical chemistry, so she was no dummy.
227640	230020	She never contradicted the science.
230020	235760	What she criticized was the way climate change was being used by a few extremists as an excuse
235760	238760	to attack the capitalist system.
238760	242880	The problem is that in the United States, powerful lobby groups have taken this to mean
242880	248280	that anyone who accepts the science must therefore be a member of this nutty anti-capitalist
248280	250480	fringe group.
250480	254920	That's why there's very little room in the USA for the voices of intelligent, free-thinking
254920	258720	conservatives who do accept the science.
258720	263800	If you want to carve out a career as a conservative pundit in the USA, you have to repeat the
263800	266440	politically correct talking points.
266440	269120	The idea that the Arctic ice is disappearing is nonsense.
269120	272460	The idea that the hockey stick graph is anything remotely resembling reality.
272460	275600	That's why they call it climate change now and not global warming because the Earth basically
275600	276960	has not been warming for the last 15 years or so.
276960	279800	OK, I'm not here to debunk all these internet myths.
279800	283660	I've done that in previous videos, and so have many others.
283660	289100	It's not hard to fact-check, so there has to be a reason why Ben Shapiro is so willing
289100	290840	to repeat these myths.
290840	295480	Well, what Shapiro says next gives us a very revealing clue.
295480	300680	All of which is to say, if you could come up with a solution that did not hurt millions
300680	305240	of people and plunge us back into the 1850s, then maybe we could talk about it.
305240	308640	So it's not really the science Ben has a problem with.
308640	313360	It's his fear that those who accept the link between CO2 and global temperature have some
313360	317680	sort of agenda and want to plunge us back to the 1850s.
317680	322940	So he's only willing to accept the science if there's an acceptable solution.
322940	323940	And he's not alone.
323940	329740	China, India, US factories, cars, coal energy plants, and hummers, not those hummers, are
329740	333020	generating only 3% of the Earth's CO2.
333020	336940	Again, I've already shown why this particular fallacy is wrong.
336940	340500	It even made it onto my list of top ten climate myths.
340500	342900	So that's not the point here.
342900	348900	Far more interesting is why Penn Jillette feels the need to regurgitate myths like this.
348900	351660	And in more pensive mood, he tells us.
351660	355300	I am not sure that all the tenets of global warming are true.
355300	357980	It seems pretty likely things are getting warmer.
357980	361100	Seems pretty likely it was anthropogenic in some way.
361100	365740	But then there comes this whole bill of goods that it has to be done by conservation, it
365740	369460	has to be done by government intervention, it has to be all this stuff.
369460	373020	And I was just saying that the whole package I didn't know about.
373020	378260	So as with Ben Shapiro, it's not really the science Penn has a problem with.
378260	382860	He's only copying the politically correct talking points because he thinks the solution
382860	385140	is more government control.
385140	387260	We'll see why they think that in part two.
387260	391820	But in the rest of the world, conservatives have no problem accepting climate science
391820	394440	and free market solutions.
394440	398060	Even ten of the world's biggest oil and gas companies accept it.
398060	403100	They say they're gearing themselves up for what they see as a huge transition into renewable
403100	404700	energy.
404700	410100	So what are these conservatives seeing that a lot of American conservatives aren't?
410100	414540	I figured out long ago that humans work most efficiently when we're free to do what we
414540	415540	like.
415540	420820	So let me be a voice that both extremes may not have heard before, belonging to the majority
420820	426460	of people who don't think scientific facts and a healthy environment and free enterprise
426460	428400	are incompatible.
428400	430660	Let me explain my thinking.
430660	435980	In my 20s, I began to formulate my idea of a government-free society, which went like
435980	436980	this.
436980	441980	Imagine an island called Fredonia, not owned by any country.
441980	447740	People in search of freedom staked their claim and settled there and agreed on just one rule.
447740	453420	Everyone has the freedom to do whatever he or she wants – own guns, smoke dope, start
453420	456220	a pig farm, anything.
456220	460540	But of course, if someone starts a pig farm in his backyard, that could pollute the water
460540	462920	his neighbours use for drinking.
462920	468080	So the inhabitants of Fredonia had to come together again to qualify the rule.
468080	473140	Everyone has the freedom to do whatever he or she wants, as long as it doesn't infringe
473140	476000	on the freedom of others.
476000	481860	So I have the freedom to dump garbage in the ocean from my private beach if I want to.
481860	486300	But if that garbage ends up on my neighbour's private beach or affects the number of fish
486300	491840	caught by an enterprising fisherman, then I'm infringing on their freedoms, their property
491840	494220	rights and business rights.
494220	499340	This is such a basic principle of conservatism, why is it so many conservatives caught up
499340	503100	in the climate debate have forgotten it?
503100	507600	In the real world, when something impinges on people's freedom like this, society finds
507600	513020	a way round it by setting targets to mitigate the problem, which encourages technological
513020	516600	innovation and free market solutions.
516600	521300	For example, when leaded gasoline infringed on a child's freedom to grow up without brain
521300	526860	impairment, the solution wasn't to ban cars or claim the researchers were faking their
526860	533540	data, it was to phase out lead in gasoline and let the free market come up with an alternative.
533540	535460	Which of course it did.
535460	539780	The same thing happened with CFCs used in aerosol sprays that were breaking down the
539780	541340	ozone layer.
541340	546640	There was a rather feeble attempt to discredit scientists and claim it was all a hoax, but
546640	552460	society accepted the science and the free market came up with alternatives.
552460	556980	The point is that none of these innovations would have come about if we'd taken the attitude
556980	564180	of Ben Shapiro, that you only recognise a problem if someone first comes up with a solution.
564180	568460	Free enterprise doesn't work like that, it's the other way round.
568460	573700	Science recognises a problem, and then companies spend time and money coming up with a solution
573700	575540	to fix it.
575540	579940	As I said, I'll tackle these fears about plunging us back to the 1850s and greater government
579940	585420	control in part two, but let's first look at a few other objections to the move towards
585420	590860	CO2 reduction, starting with the President of the United States, who thinks the Chinese
590860	596020	government invented global warming in order to trick the US into spending billions of
596020	599260	dollars fixing a problem that doesn't exist.
599260	604460	Meanwhile, he says, the Chinese themselves are spending nothing, giving them a competitive
604460	605980	edge.
605980	609740	The reality is the polar opposite.
609740	612940	First of all, clearly China didn't invent global warming.
612940	618500	The link between CO2 and global temperature has been known about for 120 years.
618500	623860	And far from doing nothing, China is now leading this energy revolution.
623860	628900	Over the last seven years, China has been the world's biggest producer and consumer
628900	631660	of renewable energy.
631660	636900	It's also the biggest investor in renewable energy research and manufacturing.
636900	643140	In 2016, China accounted for more new solar thermal and onshore wind power than the United
643140	645780	States and Europe put together.
645780	652180	In 2017, it produced twice as much renewable power as the United States.
652180	656620	Scientists on the left and on the right who claim this move to clean energy is incompatible
656620	662180	with capitalism should try telling that to Chinese entrepreneurs like Huang Ming, a solar
662180	664060	energy billionaire.
664060	669980	He made his fortune manufacturing solar thermal tubes and built this huge research and manufacturing
669980	674020	hub known as Solar Valley, south of Beijing.
674020	679620	I spent three days here doing a profile on Huang Ming and he was dismissive of the claims
679620	684380	that capitalism is incompatible with good environmental practice.
684380	689780	China is investing in renewable energy not to save the planet, but because it makes economic
689780	690780	sense.
690780	696500	Rising sea levels, a lack of water from glacial melt, increasing droughts and floods and stronger
696500	702220	typhoons, regardless of whether POTUS thinks the Chinese made it all up, these things threaten
702220	705300	China's future economic progress.
705300	710060	And since the United States government has decided to opt out, China is more than happy
710060	717240	to take the economic and technological lead in the energy revolution we're already seeing.
717240	722040	So ironically, the expenditure of billions of dollars in renewable energy that President
722040	728140	Trump was worried would cripple US factories is instead being spent in China, where factories
728140	729920	are humming.
729920	734860	Five of the world's six top solar panel manufacturers and five of the largest wind turbine
734860	738180	manufacturers are now Chinese-owned.
738180	743700	Their manufacturing drive and technological edge enables Chinese companies to sell solar
743700	749860	panels, solar thermal tubes, batteries, electric bikes and wind turbines all over the world
749860	752660	and dominate those markets.
752660	758260	According to a report by the Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis, as
758260	763620	the global transition towards renewables gains pace and as battery storage and electric vehicle
763620	768980	technologies pick up momentum, China is setting itself to dominate these sectors globally
768980	772460	over the next few decades of this century.
772460	777780	Critics say these industries are only growing because renewable energy is subsidised.
777780	780140	Without the subsidies, it would be uncompetitive.
780140	783380	Well, of course, it is subsidised.
783380	786540	That's the basic principle of Fredonia.
786540	791740	When an industry does harm to the environment, it should be discouraged and entrepreneurs
791740	795780	should be encouraged to come up with solutions.
795780	800140	It's no good arguing that if renewable energy was profitable, it would have happened without
800140	801140	subsidies.
801140	806260	The plain fact is it didn't, for the simple reason that for over a century we already
806260	810300	had a profitable source of energy, coal and oil.
810300	815180	If fossil fuels were producing electricity cheaper than solar panels and wind turbines,
815180	820100	who in their right mind would want to switch to the latter as a source of energy or invest
820100	822060	in it?
822060	826540	But all you need to do to alter that balance is to take tax breaks away from the coal and
826540	831340	oil industries and switch the money to the renewable power industry.
831340	836340	All it takes is to make solar and wind marginally cheaper in some areas, and all of a sudden
836340	838140	you have a market.
838140	843340	And once there's a market for a product, economies of scale kick in and the product gets cheaper
843340	844660	still.
844660	848700	And a market for a product means money is ploughed into research, making the product
848700	850460	more efficient.
850460	855200	As it gets cheaper, the subsidies can be lowered and eventually removed altogether.
855200	858460	And that's exactly what's happened with wind and solar.
858460	864260	Over the last ten years, the cost of manufacturing solar panels and wind turbines has plunged,
864260	867500	slashing the price of the electricity they produce.
867500	873020	At the same time, their efficiency has increased, making them even more competitive.
873020	879080	As the price falls, many countries have reduced or eliminated subsidies altogether.
879080	883960	Electricity from renewables is now so cheap that even the coal museum in Virginia decided
883960	886780	to install solar panels.
886780	892520	According to a 2017 report by the International Renewable Energy Agency, increasingly the
892520	898420	technology is competing head-to-head with conventional power sources, and doing so without
898420	901460	financial support.
901460	905900	Question number three comes from Alex Epstein, author of the book, The Moral Case for Fossil
905900	906960	Fuels.
906960	911040	This isn't exactly a newsflash, but the sun doesn't shine all the time.
911040	912980	And the wind doesn't blow all the time.
912980	918220	The only way for solar and wind to be truly useful would be if we could store them, so
918220	920580	that they would be available when we needed them.
920580	923680	The windmills are wonderful, but you know, when the wind doesn't blow, they really do
923680	926000	cause problems.
926000	927500	We have no energy this week.
927780	931980	Hopefully the wind will start blowing pretty soon.
931980	937200	It's hard to believe that this is the same nation that was once respected, even revered,
937200	941760	for having a can-do attitude that built a railroad across a continent, and put a man
941760	943320	on the moon.
943320	948360	When faced with a problem, past generations of Americans didn't just give up, they looked
948360	950520	for solutions.
950520	954360	American know-how and ingenuity was the envy of the world.
954360	958640	These days the attitude of, what can we do when the wind doesn't blow, means it's mostly
958640	963700	other countries that are rolling up their sleeves and finding solutions.
963700	967720	The intermittency problem doesn't just mean that sometimes you don't get any energy from
967720	972720	wind and solar, it also means you sometimes get too much.
972720	977400	Wind energy is so plentiful in China, that when I was in Beijing a few years ago, the
977400	981600	country had to shut down a third of its wind turbines in the north, because it couldn't
981600	984520	use all the electricity they were producing.
984520	986880	And I discovered that this is commonplace.
986880	992080	Germany sometimes produces so much electricity from renewables that the price falls to below
992080	993280	zero.
993280	998640	In other words, plant operators have to pay consumers to use it.
998640	1002640	So what's needed is an efficient way of storing this excess.
1002640	1004960	You can store oil in a tank.
1004960	1007380	Where do you store solar or wind energy?
1007380	1009880	No such mass storage system exists.
1009880	1014000	Which is like saying, we need to get to the moon in a rocket, but we can't do it because
1014000	1016640	no such rocket exists.
1016640	1021400	Or we have to build a railroad across America, but it can't be done because there are mountains
1021400	1022400	in the way.
1022400	1027300	Come on, Americans, how far would the USA have got in the past with that attitude?
1027300	1032200	If mass storage systems don't exist, roll up your sleeves and invent them.
1032200	1037760	Then hey presto, you get things that do exist, like this huge battery now feeding the grid
1037760	1039560	in South Australia.
1039560	1044760	Or in Wales, where excess electricity is pumped up to a reservoir, then runs back down through
1044760	1048160	turbines when renewables don't perform.
1048160	1053080	In Switzerland, compressed air is pumped into a sealed cave when there's too much electricity
1053080	1057440	and then released to drive turbines when there's not enough.
1057440	1062640	Energy can be stored in flywheels or as molten salt, which stays hot long enough to continue
1062640	1067480	driving turbines for eight hours after the sun's gone down, long enough to meet peak
1067480	1069240	demand.
1069240	1073520	Some excess energy is used to split water molecules to produce hydrogen, which can be
1073520	1077080	turned back into energy through combustion.
1077080	1081360	Of course, you can whine and moan that some of these systems have problems, but you know
1081360	1082920	what to do.
1082920	1085840	Roll up your sleeves and find solutions.
1085840	1089140	If you don't do it, your competitors will.
1089140	1093140	For example, lithium-ion batteries are fine, but like everything else, they need to be
1093140	1095840	made cheaper and more efficient.
1095840	1100880	Last year I went to a research institute in Taiwan to meet an engineer who did just
1100880	1101880	that.
1101880	1106900	The battery his team developed is made of aluminum – lighter, cheaper, and longer
1106900	1113400	lasting than lithium-ion batteries – and it can be recharged in just a few minutes.
1113400	1118000	Another problem is that there's a shortage of places where water can be pumped into reservoirs.
1118000	1125040	Okay, find a solution to that too, like using heavy weights on rails instead of water.
1125040	1129880	This system, by the way, was developed in the USA because some states are defying Washington's
1129880	1133200	drive to go back to coal.
1133200	1137640	If you haven't got the message by now, you won't find solutions to a problem by pretending
1137640	1140040	the problem doesn't exist.
1140040	1144040	And you won't do it by whining that the solution doesn't exist.
1144040	1148600	And you won't do it either by blaming capitalism and demanding that we go back to living in
1148600	1149600	caves.
1149600	1155440	Environmental problems get solved by recognising a problem, setting common goals to eliminate
1155440	1160400	it, and letting free enterprise and competition find the solution.
1160400	1164280	In part two of this video I look at how the Kyoto Protocol has fared.
1164280	1168920	Did it bankrupt us, or did it actually succeed in reducing CO2 emissions?
1168920	1172080	I'll talk about my visit to a carbon trading room.
1172080	1175540	How's carbon trading different to a carbon tax?
1175540	1180020	The Australian government wants to bring the economy to its knees, say no to the carbon
1180020	1181020	tax.
1181020	1186620	And what happened to Australia when it first introduced and later dropped the carbon tax?
1186620	1191580	And I'll have more on the exciting technological advances that are not only bringing us cleaner
1191580	1195860	energy, but also more efficient energy use.
1195860	1201140	Plus how to take CO2 out of the air and sell it for a profit.
1201140	1205820	But before I go, listen to this clip from President Carter when he inaugurated a solar
1205820	1209660	water heater on the roof of the White House in 1979.
1209660	1217820	A generation from now this solar heater can either be a curiosity, a museum piece, an
1217820	1226240	example of a road not taken, or it can be just a small part of one of the greatest and
1226240	1231180	most exciting adventures ever undertaken by the American people.
1231180	1237080	If America had embarked on that journey in 1979 instead of 1997, which is when the rest
1237080	1242160	of the world started that journey after the Kyoto Protocol, we'd be 20 years ahead of
1242160	1243900	where we are now.
1243900	1249760	We would have had competitive solar and wind power by 1999, and today we'd already be seeing
1249760	1255080	the drastic cuts in carbon dioxide that are planned for 2040.
1255080	1260180	And it would be America, not China, with the technological lead selling these products
1260180	1262600	to the rest of the world.
1262600	1268320	But when Ronald Reagan came to office, the White House solar water heater was taken down.
1268320	1269320	Where is it now?
1269320	1272160	Well, Carter's words were prophetic.
1272160	1278280	A museum piece, an example of a road not taken.
1278280	1283800	To be precise, it's in Huang Ming's solar museum in Solar Valley.
1283800	1289800	An example of the road America didn't take and still won't take, but along which China
1289800	1291840	is more than happy to lead the way.
