WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:04.480
I want to address all sides of the ideological spectrum for a moment and hope we can all

00:04.480 --> 00:06.880
agree on a few facts.

00:06.880 --> 00:11.960
Over the last 200 years, surely we can agree that coal and oil have taken the world from

00:11.960 --> 00:17.800
a patchwork of backward rural economies through the Industrial Revolution into the modern

00:17.800 --> 00:18.800
age.

00:18.800 --> 00:24.560
I used to work as a geologist on oil exploration rigs in the Mediterranean and the North Sea,

00:24.560 --> 00:30.960
and help find the fossil fuels that have given you and me all the comforts we now enjoy.

00:30.960 --> 00:34.920
Like it or not, that is the economic reality.

00:34.920 --> 00:39.640
But we also have to acknowledge the fact that burning these fuels has caused problems like

00:39.640 --> 00:45.200
pollution, bad health, and above all raised the level of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere

00:45.200 --> 00:48.520
to the point at which it's causing global warming.

00:48.520 --> 00:52.640
Like it or not, that's the scientific reality.

00:52.640 --> 00:56.760
We're led to believe that the two sides of this debate are those who say the only way

00:56.760 --> 01:01.960
to deal with anthropogenic climate change is to dismantle the capitalist system, and

01:01.960 --> 01:04.680
those who want to pretend it's all a hoax.

01:04.680 --> 01:09.800
I think the majority of sensible people would like to deal with the problem and support

01:09.800 --> 01:12.160
the free market system.

01:12.160 --> 01:16.480
Normally I wouldn't tackle a subject like this, but I need to address the messages I

01:16.480 --> 01:23.140
get every time I make a video about science, suggesting that accepting science is an indication

01:23.140 --> 01:29.400
that I must be left-wing, as if all conservatives must be scientifically illiterate, or that

01:29.400 --> 01:33.120
science and capitalism are incompatible.

01:33.120 --> 01:37.840
So forgive me for spending a couple of videos on how climate science relates to the world

01:37.840 --> 01:39.880
of politics and economics.

01:39.880 --> 01:41.920
I'll put that away.

01:41.920 --> 01:44.420
This whole video is my opinion.

01:44.420 --> 01:48.980
But it's going to be an opinion based on facts, and as always, my sources are cited

01:48.980 --> 01:50.980
in the video description.

01:50.980 --> 01:57.100
I want to show why I think science, a healthy environment, and free enterprise are all essential

01:57.100 --> 02:02.180
elements of our democratic way of life, and I want you to meet some of the entrepreneurs

02:02.180 --> 02:09.100
and inventors I've met as a science reporter who are leading an energy revolution.

02:09.100 --> 02:13.920
But first, how did climate science suddenly become a political issue?

02:13.920 --> 02:17.800
After all, the link between carbon dioxide and temperature has been accepted by research

02:17.800 --> 02:24.920
scientists since it was first discovered in 1896 and confirmed in the 1940s.

02:24.920 --> 02:30.600
But the problem was largely confined to the scientific community, until a visionary politician,

02:30.600 --> 02:36.480
who really understood the science, spoke out on the world stage, and for the first time

02:36.480 --> 02:39.200
gave us this stark warning.

02:39.200 --> 02:44.360
I spoke about the global threat of climate change.

02:44.360 --> 02:48.720
I set out the magnitude of the challenge we face.

02:48.720 --> 02:55.360
Until recently, we've always thought that whatever progress humanity makes, our planet

02:55.360 --> 02:58.300
would stay much the same.

02:58.300 --> 02:59.840
That may no longer be true.

02:59.840 --> 03:06.840
Next month, I shall be going to the United Nations to set out our view on how the world

03:06.880 --> 03:09.640
should tackle climate change.

03:09.640 --> 03:14.880
We've proposed a global convention, a sort of good conduct guide to the environment for

03:14.880 --> 03:19.320
all the world's nations, on problems like the greenhouse effect.

03:19.320 --> 03:25.320
Britain has taken the lead internationally, and we shall continue to do so.

03:25.320 --> 03:32.320
Yes, it was a staunch conservative, the Iron Lady herself, who gave a series of speeches

03:32.320 --> 03:38.080
on global warming 17 years before Al Gore turned it into a movie.

03:38.080 --> 03:42.960
To those who say Margaret Thatcher later rescinded her position, no, she didn't.

03:42.960 --> 03:47.640
She has a degree in analytical chemistry, so she was no dummy.

03:47.640 --> 03:50.020
She never contradicted the science.

03:50.020 --> 03:55.760
What she criticized was the way climate change was being used by a few extremists as an excuse

03:55.760 --> 03:58.760
to attack the capitalist system.

03:58.760 --> 04:02.880
The problem is that in the United States, powerful lobby groups have taken this to mean

04:02.880 --> 04:08.280
that anyone who accepts the science must therefore be a member of this nutty anti-capitalist

04:08.280 --> 04:10.480
fringe group.

04:10.480 --> 04:14.920
That's why there's very little room in the USA for the voices of intelligent, free-thinking

04:14.920 --> 04:18.720
conservatives who do accept the science.

04:18.720 --> 04:23.800
If you want to carve out a career as a conservative pundit in the USA, you have to repeat the

04:23.800 --> 04:26.440
politically correct talking points.

04:26.440 --> 04:29.120
The idea that the Arctic ice is disappearing is nonsense.

04:29.120 --> 04:32.460
The idea that the hockey stick graph is anything remotely resembling reality.

04:32.460 --> 04:35.600
That's why they call it climate change now and not global warming because the Earth basically

04:35.600 --> 04:36.960
has not been warming for the last 15 years or so.

04:36.960 --> 04:39.800
OK, I'm not here to debunk all these internet myths.

04:39.800 --> 04:43.660
I've done that in previous videos, and so have many others.

04:43.660 --> 04:49.100
It's not hard to fact-check, so there has to be a reason why Ben Shapiro is so willing

04:49.100 --> 04:50.840
to repeat these myths.

04:50.840 --> 04:55.480
Well, what Shapiro says next gives us a very revealing clue.

04:55.480 --> 05:00.680
All of which is to say, if you could come up with a solution that did not hurt millions

05:00.680 --> 05:05.240
of people and plunge us back into the 1850s, then maybe we could talk about it.

05:05.240 --> 05:08.640
So it's not really the science Ben has a problem with.

05:08.640 --> 05:13.360
It's his fear that those who accept the link between CO2 and global temperature have some

05:13.360 --> 05:17.680
sort of agenda and want to plunge us back to the 1850s.

05:17.680 --> 05:22.940
So he's only willing to accept the science if there's an acceptable solution.

05:22.940 --> 05:23.940
And he's not alone.

05:23.940 --> 05:29.740
China, India, US factories, cars, coal energy plants, and hummers, not those hummers, are

05:29.740 --> 05:33.020
generating only 3% of the Earth's CO2.

05:33.020 --> 05:36.940
Again, I've already shown why this particular fallacy is wrong.

05:36.940 --> 05:40.500
It even made it onto my list of top ten climate myths.

05:40.500 --> 05:42.900
So that's not the point here.

05:42.900 --> 05:48.900
Far more interesting is why Penn Jillette feels the need to regurgitate myths like this.

05:48.900 --> 05:51.660
And in more pensive mood, he tells us.

05:51.660 --> 05:55.300
I am not sure that all the tenets of global warming are true.

05:55.300 --> 05:57.980
It seems pretty likely things are getting warmer.

05:57.980 --> 06:01.100
Seems pretty likely it was anthropogenic in some way.

06:01.100 --> 06:05.740
But then there comes this whole bill of goods that it has to be done by conservation, it

06:05.740 --> 06:09.460
has to be done by government intervention, it has to be all this stuff.

06:09.460 --> 06:13.020
And I was just saying that the whole package I didn't know about.

06:13.020 --> 06:18.260
So as with Ben Shapiro, it's not really the science Penn has a problem with.

06:18.260 --> 06:22.860
He's only copying the politically correct talking points because he thinks the solution

06:22.860 --> 06:25.140
is more government control.

06:25.140 --> 06:27.260
We'll see why they think that in part two.

06:27.260 --> 06:31.820
But in the rest of the world, conservatives have no problem accepting climate science

06:31.820 --> 06:34.440
and free market solutions.

06:34.440 --> 06:38.060
Even ten of the world's biggest oil and gas companies accept it.

06:38.060 --> 06:43.100
They say they're gearing themselves up for what they see as a huge transition into renewable

06:43.100 --> 06:44.700
energy.

06:44.700 --> 06:50.100
So what are these conservatives seeing that a lot of American conservatives aren't?

06:50.100 --> 06:54.540
I figured out long ago that humans work most efficiently when we're free to do what we

06:54.540 --> 06:55.540
like.

06:55.540 --> 07:00.820
So let me be a voice that both extremes may not have heard before, belonging to the majority

07:00.820 --> 07:06.460
of people who don't think scientific facts and a healthy environment and free enterprise

07:06.460 --> 07:08.400
are incompatible.

07:08.400 --> 07:10.660
Let me explain my thinking.

07:10.660 --> 07:15.980
In my 20s, I began to formulate my idea of a government-free society, which went like

07:15.980 --> 07:16.980
this.

07:16.980 --> 07:21.980
Imagine an island called Fredonia, not owned by any country.

07:21.980 --> 07:27.740
People in search of freedom staked their claim and settled there and agreed on just one rule.

07:27.740 --> 07:33.420
Everyone has the freedom to do whatever he or she wants – own guns, smoke dope, start

07:33.420 --> 07:36.220
a pig farm, anything.

07:36.220 --> 07:40.540
But of course, if someone starts a pig farm in his backyard, that could pollute the water

07:40.540 --> 07:42.920
his neighbours use for drinking.

07:42.920 --> 07:48.080
So the inhabitants of Fredonia had to come together again to qualify the rule.

07:48.080 --> 07:53.140
Everyone has the freedom to do whatever he or she wants, as long as it doesn't infringe

07:53.140 --> 07:56.000
on the freedom of others.

07:56.000 --> 08:01.860
So I have the freedom to dump garbage in the ocean from my private beach if I want to.

08:01.860 --> 08:06.300
But if that garbage ends up on my neighbour's private beach or affects the number of fish

08:06.300 --> 08:11.840
caught by an enterprising fisherman, then I'm infringing on their freedoms, their property

08:11.840 --> 08:14.220
rights and business rights.

08:14.220 --> 08:19.340
This is such a basic principle of conservatism, why is it so many conservatives caught up

08:19.340 --> 08:23.100
in the climate debate have forgotten it?

08:23.100 --> 08:27.600
In the real world, when something impinges on people's freedom like this, society finds

08:27.600 --> 08:33.020
a way round it by setting targets to mitigate the problem, which encourages technological

08:33.020 --> 08:36.600
innovation and free market solutions.

08:36.600 --> 08:41.300
For example, when leaded gasoline infringed on a child's freedom to grow up without brain

08:41.300 --> 08:46.860
impairment, the solution wasn't to ban cars or claim the researchers were faking their

08:46.860 --> 08:53.540
data, it was to phase out lead in gasoline and let the free market come up with an alternative.

08:53.540 --> 08:55.460
Which of course it did.

08:55.460 --> 08:59.780
The same thing happened with CFCs used in aerosol sprays that were breaking down the

08:59.780 --> 09:01.340
ozone layer.

09:01.340 --> 09:06.640
There was a rather feeble attempt to discredit scientists and claim it was all a hoax, but

09:06.640 --> 09:12.460
society accepted the science and the free market came up with alternatives.

09:12.460 --> 09:16.980
The point is that none of these innovations would have come about if we'd taken the attitude

09:16.980 --> 09:24.180
of Ben Shapiro, that you only recognise a problem if someone first comes up with a solution.

09:24.180 --> 09:28.460
Free enterprise doesn't work like that, it's the other way round.

09:28.460 --> 09:33.700
Science recognises a problem, and then companies spend time and money coming up with a solution

09:33.700 --> 09:35.540
to fix it.

09:35.540 --> 09:39.940
As I said, I'll tackle these fears about plunging us back to the 1850s and greater government

09:39.940 --> 09:45.420
control in part two, but let's first look at a few other objections to the move towards

09:45.420 --> 09:50.860
CO2 reduction, starting with the President of the United States, who thinks the Chinese

09:50.860 --> 09:56.020
government invented global warming in order to trick the US into spending billions of

09:56.020 --> 09:59.260
dollars fixing a problem that doesn't exist.

09:59.260 --> 10:04.460
Meanwhile, he says, the Chinese themselves are spending nothing, giving them a competitive

10:04.460 --> 10:05.980
edge.

10:05.980 --> 10:09.740
The reality is the polar opposite.

10:09.740 --> 10:12.940
First of all, clearly China didn't invent global warming.

10:12.940 --> 10:18.500
The link between CO2 and global temperature has been known about for 120 years.

10:18.500 --> 10:23.860
And far from doing nothing, China is now leading this energy revolution.

10:23.860 --> 10:28.900
Over the last seven years, China has been the world's biggest producer and consumer

10:28.900 --> 10:31.660
of renewable energy.

10:31.660 --> 10:36.900
It's also the biggest investor in renewable energy research and manufacturing.

10:36.900 --> 10:43.140
In 2016, China accounted for more new solar thermal and onshore wind power than the United

10:43.140 --> 10:45.780
States and Europe put together.

10:45.780 --> 10:52.180
In 2017, it produced twice as much renewable power as the United States.

10:52.180 --> 10:56.620
Scientists on the left and on the right who claim this move to clean energy is incompatible

10:56.620 --> 11:02.180
with capitalism should try telling that to Chinese entrepreneurs like Huang Ming, a solar

11:02.180 --> 11:04.060
energy billionaire.

11:04.060 --> 11:09.980
He made his fortune manufacturing solar thermal tubes and built this huge research and manufacturing

11:09.980 --> 11:14.020
hub known as Solar Valley, south of Beijing.

11:14.020 --> 11:19.620
I spent three days here doing a profile on Huang Ming and he was dismissive of the claims

11:19.620 --> 11:24.380
that capitalism is incompatible with good environmental practice.

11:24.380 --> 11:29.780
China is investing in renewable energy not to save the planet, but because it makes economic

11:29.780 --> 11:30.780
sense.

11:30.780 --> 11:36.500
Rising sea levels, a lack of water from glacial melt, increasing droughts and floods and stronger

11:36.500 --> 11:42.220
typhoons, regardless of whether POTUS thinks the Chinese made it all up, these things threaten

11:42.220 --> 11:45.300
China's future economic progress.

11:45.300 --> 11:50.060
And since the United States government has decided to opt out, China is more than happy

11:50.060 --> 11:57.240
to take the economic and technological lead in the energy revolution we're already seeing.

11:57.240 --> 12:02.040
So ironically, the expenditure of billions of dollars in renewable energy that President

12:02.040 --> 12:08.140
Trump was worried would cripple US factories is instead being spent in China, where factories

12:08.140 --> 12:09.920
are humming.

12:09.920 --> 12:14.860
Five of the world's six top solar panel manufacturers and five of the largest wind turbine

12:14.860 --> 12:18.180
manufacturers are now Chinese-owned.

12:18.180 --> 12:23.700
Their manufacturing drive and technological edge enables Chinese companies to sell solar

12:23.700 --> 12:29.860
panels, solar thermal tubes, batteries, electric bikes and wind turbines all over the world

12:29.860 --> 12:32.660
and dominate those markets.

12:32.660 --> 12:38.260
According to a report by the Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis, as

12:38.260 --> 12:43.620
the global transition towards renewables gains pace and as battery storage and electric vehicle

12:43.620 --> 12:48.980
technologies pick up momentum, China is setting itself to dominate these sectors globally

12:48.980 --> 12:52.460
over the next few decades of this century.

12:52.460 --> 12:57.780
Critics say these industries are only growing because renewable energy is subsidised.

12:57.780 --> 13:00.140
Without the subsidies, it would be uncompetitive.

13:00.140 --> 13:03.380
Well, of course, it is subsidised.

13:03.380 --> 13:06.540
That's the basic principle of Fredonia.

13:06.540 --> 13:11.740
When an industry does harm to the environment, it should be discouraged and entrepreneurs

13:11.740 --> 13:15.780
should be encouraged to come up with solutions.

13:15.780 --> 13:20.140
It's no good arguing that if renewable energy was profitable, it would have happened without

13:20.140 --> 13:21.140
subsidies.

13:21.140 --> 13:26.260
The plain fact is it didn't, for the simple reason that for over a century we already

13:26.260 --> 13:30.300
had a profitable source of energy, coal and oil.

13:30.300 --> 13:35.180
If fossil fuels were producing electricity cheaper than solar panels and wind turbines,

13:35.180 --> 13:40.100
who in their right mind would want to switch to the latter as a source of energy or invest

13:40.100 --> 13:42.060
in it?

13:42.060 --> 13:46.540
But all you need to do to alter that balance is to take tax breaks away from the coal and

13:46.540 --> 13:51.340
oil industries and switch the money to the renewable power industry.

13:51.340 --> 13:56.340
All it takes is to make solar and wind marginally cheaper in some areas, and all of a sudden

13:56.340 --> 13:58.140
you have a market.

13:58.140 --> 14:03.340
And once there's a market for a product, economies of scale kick in and the product gets cheaper

14:03.340 --> 14:04.660
still.

14:04.660 --> 14:08.700
And a market for a product means money is ploughed into research, making the product

14:08.700 --> 14:10.460
more efficient.

14:10.460 --> 14:15.200
As it gets cheaper, the subsidies can be lowered and eventually removed altogether.

14:15.200 --> 14:18.460
And that's exactly what's happened with wind and solar.

14:18.460 --> 14:24.260
Over the last ten years, the cost of manufacturing solar panels and wind turbines has plunged,

14:24.260 --> 14:27.500
slashing the price of the electricity they produce.

14:27.500 --> 14:33.020
At the same time, their efficiency has increased, making them even more competitive.

14:33.020 --> 14:39.080
As the price falls, many countries have reduced or eliminated subsidies altogether.

14:39.080 --> 14:43.960
Electricity from renewables is now so cheap that even the coal museum in Virginia decided

14:43.960 --> 14:46.780
to install solar panels.

14:46.780 --> 14:52.520
According to a 2017 report by the International Renewable Energy Agency, increasingly the

14:52.520 --> 14:58.420
technology is competing head-to-head with conventional power sources, and doing so without

14:58.420 --> 15:01.460
financial support.

15:01.460 --> 15:05.900
Question number three comes from Alex Epstein, author of the book, The Moral Case for Fossil

15:05.900 --> 15:06.960
Fuels.

15:06.960 --> 15:11.040
This isn't exactly a newsflash, but the sun doesn't shine all the time.

15:11.040 --> 15:12.980
And the wind doesn't blow all the time.

15:12.980 --> 15:18.220
The only way for solar and wind to be truly useful would be if we could store them, so

15:18.220 --> 15:20.580
that they would be available when we needed them.

15:20.580 --> 15:23.680
The windmills are wonderful, but you know, when the wind doesn't blow, they really do

15:23.680 --> 15:26.000
cause problems.

15:26.000 --> 15:27.500
We have no energy this week.

15:27.780 --> 15:31.980
Hopefully the wind will start blowing pretty soon.

15:31.980 --> 15:37.200
It's hard to believe that this is the same nation that was once respected, even revered,

15:37.200 --> 15:41.760
for having a can-do attitude that built a railroad across a continent, and put a man

15:41.760 --> 15:43.320
on the moon.

15:43.320 --> 15:48.360
When faced with a problem, past generations of Americans didn't just give up, they looked

15:48.360 --> 15:50.520
for solutions.

15:50.520 --> 15:54.360
American know-how and ingenuity was the envy of the world.

15:54.360 --> 15:58.640
These days the attitude of, what can we do when the wind doesn't blow, means it's mostly

15:58.640 --> 16:03.700
other countries that are rolling up their sleeves and finding solutions.

16:03.700 --> 16:07.720
The intermittency problem doesn't just mean that sometimes you don't get any energy from

16:07.720 --> 16:12.720
wind and solar, it also means you sometimes get too much.

16:12.720 --> 16:17.400
Wind energy is so plentiful in China, that when I was in Beijing a few years ago, the

16:17.400 --> 16:21.600
country had to shut down a third of its wind turbines in the north, because it couldn't

16:21.600 --> 16:24.520
use all the electricity they were producing.

16:24.520 --> 16:26.880
And I discovered that this is commonplace.

16:26.880 --> 16:32.080
Germany sometimes produces so much electricity from renewables that the price falls to below

16:32.080 --> 16:33.280
zero.

16:33.280 --> 16:38.640
In other words, plant operators have to pay consumers to use it.

16:38.640 --> 16:42.640
So what's needed is an efficient way of storing this excess.

16:42.640 --> 16:44.960
You can store oil in a tank.

16:44.960 --> 16:47.380
Where do you store solar or wind energy?

16:47.380 --> 16:49.880
No such mass storage system exists.

16:49.880 --> 16:54.000
Which is like saying, we need to get to the moon in a rocket, but we can't do it because

16:54.000 --> 16:56.640
no such rocket exists.

16:56.640 --> 17:01.400
Or we have to build a railroad across America, but it can't be done because there are mountains

17:01.400 --> 17:02.400
in the way.

17:02.400 --> 17:07.300
Come on, Americans, how far would the USA have got in the past with that attitude?

17:07.300 --> 17:12.200
If mass storage systems don't exist, roll up your sleeves and invent them.

17:12.200 --> 17:17.760
Then hey presto, you get things that do exist, like this huge battery now feeding the grid

17:17.760 --> 17:19.560
in South Australia.

17:19.560 --> 17:24.760
Or in Wales, where excess electricity is pumped up to a reservoir, then runs back down through

17:24.760 --> 17:28.160
turbines when renewables don't perform.

17:28.160 --> 17:33.080
In Switzerland, compressed air is pumped into a sealed cave when there's too much electricity

17:33.080 --> 17:37.440
and then released to drive turbines when there's not enough.

17:37.440 --> 17:42.640
Energy can be stored in flywheels or as molten salt, which stays hot long enough to continue

17:42.640 --> 17:47.480
driving turbines for eight hours after the sun's gone down, long enough to meet peak

17:47.480 --> 17:49.240
demand.

17:49.240 --> 17:53.520
Some excess energy is used to split water molecules to produce hydrogen, which can be

17:53.520 --> 17:57.080
turned back into energy through combustion.

17:57.080 --> 18:01.360
Of course, you can whine and moan that some of these systems have problems, but you know

18:01.360 --> 18:02.920
what to do.

18:02.920 --> 18:05.840
Roll up your sleeves and find solutions.

18:05.840 --> 18:09.140
If you don't do it, your competitors will.

18:09.140 --> 18:13.140
For example, lithium-ion batteries are fine, but like everything else, they need to be

18:13.140 --> 18:15.840
made cheaper and more efficient.

18:15.840 --> 18:20.880
Last year I went to a research institute in Taiwan to meet an engineer who did just

18:20.880 --> 18:21.880
that.

18:21.880 --> 18:26.900
The battery his team developed is made of aluminum – lighter, cheaper, and longer

18:26.900 --> 18:33.400
lasting than lithium-ion batteries – and it can be recharged in just a few minutes.

18:33.400 --> 18:38.000
Another problem is that there's a shortage of places where water can be pumped into reservoirs.

18:38.000 --> 18:45.040
Okay, find a solution to that too, like using heavy weights on rails instead of water.

18:45.040 --> 18:49.880
This system, by the way, was developed in the USA because some states are defying Washington's

18:49.880 --> 18:53.200
drive to go back to coal.

18:53.200 --> 18:57.640
If you haven't got the message by now, you won't find solutions to a problem by pretending

18:57.640 --> 19:00.040
the problem doesn't exist.

19:00.040 --> 19:04.040
And you won't do it by whining that the solution doesn't exist.

19:04.040 --> 19:08.600
And you won't do it either by blaming capitalism and demanding that we go back to living in

19:08.600 --> 19:09.600
caves.

19:09.600 --> 19:15.440
Environmental problems get solved by recognising a problem, setting common goals to eliminate

19:15.440 --> 19:20.400
it, and letting free enterprise and competition find the solution.

19:20.400 --> 19:24.280
In part two of this video I look at how the Kyoto Protocol has fared.

19:24.280 --> 19:28.920
Did it bankrupt us, or did it actually succeed in reducing CO2 emissions?

19:28.920 --> 19:32.080
I'll talk about my visit to a carbon trading room.

19:32.080 --> 19:35.540
How's carbon trading different to a carbon tax?

19:35.540 --> 19:40.020
The Australian government wants to bring the economy to its knees, say no to the carbon

19:40.020 --> 19:41.020
tax.

19:41.020 --> 19:46.620
And what happened to Australia when it first introduced and later dropped the carbon tax?

19:46.620 --> 19:51.580
And I'll have more on the exciting technological advances that are not only bringing us cleaner

19:51.580 --> 19:55.860
energy, but also more efficient energy use.

19:55.860 --> 20:01.140
Plus how to take CO2 out of the air and sell it for a profit.

20:01.140 --> 20:05.820
But before I go, listen to this clip from President Carter when he inaugurated a solar

20:05.820 --> 20:09.660
water heater on the roof of the White House in 1979.

20:09.660 --> 20:17.820
A generation from now this solar heater can either be a curiosity, a museum piece, an

20:17.820 --> 20:26.240
example of a road not taken, or it can be just a small part of one of the greatest and

20:26.240 --> 20:31.180
most exciting adventures ever undertaken by the American people.

20:31.180 --> 20:37.080
If America had embarked on that journey in 1979 instead of 1997, which is when the rest

20:37.080 --> 20:42.160
of the world started that journey after the Kyoto Protocol, we'd be 20 years ahead of

20:42.160 --> 20:43.900
where we are now.

20:43.900 --> 20:49.760
We would have had competitive solar and wind power by 1999, and today we'd already be seeing

20:49.760 --> 20:55.080
the drastic cuts in carbon dioxide that are planned for 2040.

20:55.080 --> 21:00.180
And it would be America, not China, with the technological lead selling these products

21:00.180 --> 21:02.600
to the rest of the world.

21:02.600 --> 21:08.320
But when Ronald Reagan came to office, the White House solar water heater was taken down.

21:08.320 --> 21:09.320
Where is it now?

21:09.320 --> 21:12.160
Well, Carter's words were prophetic.

21:12.160 --> 21:18.280
A museum piece, an example of a road not taken.

21:18.280 --> 21:23.800
To be precise, it's in Huang Ming's solar museum in Solar Valley.

21:23.800 --> 21:29.800
An example of the road America didn't take and still won't take, but along which China

21:29.800 --> 21:31.840
is more than happy to lead the way.
