00:00.000 --> 00:03.880
Ah, that putative medieval warm period.

00:03.880 --> 00:06.720
It was local and didn't have much effect.

00:06.720 --> 00:11.240
Or it was global, much warmer than today, and proof that carbon dioxide doesn't cause

00:11.240 --> 00:12.800
global warming.

00:12.800 --> 00:15.440
It depends on what you believe, doesn't it?

00:15.440 --> 00:20.820
Well, as in all areas of science, no, it depends on what the evidence shows.

00:20.820 --> 00:25.300
So in this video I want to look at the evidence for the medieval warm period that answers

00:25.300 --> 00:27.560
three basic questions.

00:27.560 --> 00:28.780
Was it global?

00:28.780 --> 00:30.460
Was it warmer than today?

00:30.460 --> 00:32.960
And what does all this matter anyway?

00:32.960 --> 00:36.780
And of course along the way we'll look at the strange and divisive battle over the hockey

00:36.780 --> 00:37.780
stick.

00:37.780 --> 00:39.820
But let's start with a familiar face.

00:39.820 --> 00:46.340
Seven hundred scientists from more than four hundred institutions in more than forty countries

00:46.340 --> 00:50.660
in the last twenty years have contributed to papers that I know about and can on notice

00:50.660 --> 00:57.140
list saying that the medieval warm period, which is well known in history and archaeology

00:57.140 --> 01:04.300
as it is in climate science, was real, was global and was noticeably warmer than the

01:04.300 --> 01:05.300
present.

01:05.300 --> 01:09.180
Moncton was as good as his word and when I asked him for the list he gave it to me.

01:09.180 --> 01:13.580
Unfortunately I'm probably the only person who ever asked him because the list doesn't

01:13.580 --> 01:15.340
live up to his claim.

01:15.340 --> 01:20.180
The seven hundred scientists who contribute to the papers listed don't say the medieval

01:20.180 --> 01:25.860
warm period was real, global and noticeably warmer than today or anything like it.

01:25.860 --> 01:31.200
If you don't believe me, you'll find the list of papers on the CO2science.org website,

01:31.200 --> 01:35.360
so by all means read through them and see how many you have to read before you can find

01:35.360 --> 01:39.100
a single one that says what Moncton claims it says.

01:39.100 --> 01:42.840
Of course there's no doubt there was a warming event around eleven hundred to eight hundred

01:42.840 --> 01:43.840
years ago.

01:43.840 --> 01:46.340
That's been known for at least fifty years.

01:46.340 --> 01:51.740
The question has always been was this localised warming or was it a global event?

01:51.740 --> 01:55.260
At first the warming was thought to have been limited to the North Atlantic and Western

01:55.260 --> 01:59.940
Europe because the evidence from historical records was so clear.

01:59.940 --> 02:03.780
Even now we have a lot of evidence from the Northern Hemisphere but very little from the

02:03.780 --> 02:08.320
Southern Hemisphere but I think it's fair to say that the more evidence that comes in,

02:08.320 --> 02:13.140
the more it does support the idea that this event was global.

02:13.140 --> 02:16.140
So the next question is was it warmer than today?

02:16.140 --> 02:18.220
Craig Izzo believes it was.

02:18.220 --> 02:22.880
He's the man who collected all those papers that Moncton misquoted but only some of them

02:22.880 --> 02:27.000
quantify the amount of warming during the medieval warm period and not all of those

02:27.000 --> 02:29.920
compared it to the recent period of warming.

02:29.920 --> 02:34.720
A proper analysis has to look at studies that are geographically diverse and compare the

02:34.720 --> 02:39.900
medieval warm period to the present, not twenty, thirty or fifty years ago.

02:39.900 --> 02:45.160
That was first done in 1998 for the Northern Hemisphere by Mann, Bradley and Hughes and

02:45.160 --> 02:47.260
the hockey stick was born.

02:47.260 --> 02:51.820
The following year they published another paper extending the timeline back to 1000

02:51.820 --> 02:52.820
AD.

02:52.820 --> 02:57.100
Actually, it's only a hockey stick if you eliminate the error bars because there was

02:57.100 --> 03:00.340
still a lot of uncertainty in the proxies used.

03:00.340 --> 03:06.740
In 2004 various flaws were highlighted in a rebuttal paper by Steve McIntyre and Ross

03:06.740 --> 03:07.820
McKittrick.

03:07.820 --> 03:12.060
They criticised the over-reliance on tree ring data and suggested the hockey stick's

03:12.060 --> 03:18.220
shape was created artificially because of an incorrect statistical analysis.

03:18.220 --> 03:21.420
To sort out the controversy there were two investigations.

03:21.420 --> 03:25.860
Congress commissioned a report by the National Academy of Sciences which confirmed a lot

03:25.860 --> 03:31.040
of the uncertainties in the proxies used but found the conclusions plausible.

03:31.040 --> 03:35.560
The House Committee on Energy and Commerce commissioned a report by Statistics Professor

03:35.560 --> 03:37.220
Edward Wegman.

03:37.220 --> 03:41.900
The Wegman report is controversial because it delved into areas outside of Wegman's

03:41.900 --> 03:46.900
expertise as a statistician and a lot of it was later found to have been plagiarised,

03:46.900 --> 03:49.060
in part from Wikipedia.

03:49.060 --> 03:53.100
For this reason it was withdrawn by the journal in which it was published.

03:53.100 --> 03:57.860
But I can't see that this invalidates Wegman's conclusions on the statistics, which after

03:57.860 --> 04:00.580
all is his field of expertise.

04:00.580 --> 04:05.540
He concluded that the main point of controversy was that Mann, Bradley and Hughes, collectively

04:05.540 --> 04:11.380
known as MBH, had centred the mean for their reconstruction in the 20th century rather

04:11.380 --> 04:13.300
than the entire timeline.

04:13.300 --> 04:18.820
MBH themselves accepted the errors that were validated and corrected their reconstruction

04:18.820 --> 04:19.820
in 2008.

04:19.820 --> 04:24.900
I won't go into the details of either congressional report because even by the time they were

04:24.900 --> 04:28.100
commissioned they were largely irrelevant.

04:28.100 --> 04:34.420
Several more reconstructions had been published by then and these superseded MBH 1999 using

04:34.420 --> 04:39.620
a wealth of new proxy data with and without the controversial tree rings.

04:39.620 --> 04:43.700
Whether you want to continue calling these reconstructions hockey sticks doesn't really

04:43.700 --> 04:44.700
matter.

04:44.700 --> 04:49.040
What climatologists see is the same pattern in all of them, warming during the medieval

04:49.040 --> 04:53.900
warm period and then a steep acceleration of warming at the end of the 20th and early

04:53.900 --> 04:55.700
21st centuries.

04:55.700 --> 05:00.900
Perhaps the best sign of how seriously climate science critics are taking these later reconstructions

05:00.900 --> 05:05.380
is that they are not being debunked because of errors and flaws or accusations of fraud.

05:05.380 --> 05:07.700
They are being doctored.

05:07.700 --> 05:12.780
Take for example the most recent reconstruction by Esper et al using tree rings from northern

05:12.780 --> 05:14.420
Scandinavia.

05:14.420 --> 05:17.600
The study prompted this headline in the Daily Mail.

05:17.600 --> 05:22.260
Tree rings prove climate was warmer in Roman and medieval times than it is now.

05:22.260 --> 05:25.100
Well in northern Scandinavia at least.

05:25.100 --> 05:29.900
And the Daily Mail has a graph purportedly taken from the paper to prove it.

05:29.900 --> 05:35.160
The story was written by someone who has been designated the Daily Mail's science reporter.

05:35.160 --> 05:40.380
But if we check Esper's paper, no surprise, it doesn't agree with the headline.

05:40.380 --> 05:45.100
This is the reconstruction shown in the paper, with recent temperatures from northern Scandinavia

05:45.100 --> 05:46.740
shown in red.

05:46.740 --> 05:51.860
In the Mail's story and other blogs, the recent temperature data have been erased.

05:51.860 --> 05:56.340
Airbrushing out recent temperature rises has become something of an art form among bloggers.

05:56.820 --> 06:01.020
Here's a 2000 year reconstruction, as explained by meteorologist Art Horn.

06:01.020 --> 06:05.020
Back in the medieval warm period it was as warm or warmer than today back in part of

06:05.020 --> 06:06.020
the Roman Empire.

06:06.020 --> 06:09.820
In the Roman warm period it was as warm or warmer than today.

06:09.820 --> 06:13.020
Horn seems to draw this conclusion from the graph he shows.

06:13.020 --> 06:19.860
I tracked it down to Craig Idso's website, CO2Science, where it was adapted from a 2010

06:19.860 --> 06:21.980
paper by Lundqvist.

06:21.980 --> 06:27.020
But how did Horn conclude that the reconstruction shows a warmer medieval warm period when the

06:27.020 --> 06:29.500
author himself doesn't?

06:29.500 --> 06:33.740
Lundqvist says the last two decades have been possibly hotter than at any time over the

06:33.740 --> 06:35.500
last 2000 years.

06:35.500 --> 06:38.020
Can't Lundqvist read his own graph?

06:38.020 --> 06:41.660
No, it turns out this isn't Lundqvist's graph.

06:41.660 --> 06:43.100
It's been doctored.

06:43.100 --> 06:45.660
That's what adapted means in this case.

06:45.660 --> 06:49.700
The high temperatures of the last few decades have been airbrushed out.

06:50.580 --> 06:53.900
Here's the original as it appeared in Lundqvist's paper.

06:53.900 --> 06:58.460
Here are two more 2000 year reconstructions doing the rounds of the blogosphere.

06:58.460 --> 07:02.260
Several folks have tried to step back from the man hockey team approach and to use a

07:02.260 --> 07:05.300
more fair selection of less controversial proxies.

07:05.300 --> 07:09.860
Two such researchers are Moberg, who is generally considered a strong global warming supporter,

07:09.860 --> 07:12.100
and Lowell, who is more of a sceptic.

07:12.100 --> 07:14.580
And lo and behold, it comes right back to where we started.

07:14.580 --> 07:19.100
We get the medieval warm period around 1000, we get a little ice age, and the temperature

07:19.100 --> 07:22.460
today is similar or even lower than those in the Middle Ages.

07:22.460 --> 07:27.220
Let's take the graph on the left first, which narrator Warren Meyer says comes from Moberg's

07:27.220 --> 07:29.540
2005 study.

07:29.540 --> 07:32.260
But of course it's been adapted.

07:32.260 --> 07:36.820
If we look at Moberg's original, we can see that the instrumental temperature data showing

07:36.820 --> 07:40.460
late 20th century warming has been erased.

07:40.460 --> 07:45.220
Worse than that, Moberg's proxy data, that he says in the caption goes back as far as

07:45.220 --> 07:50.820
1979, is extended to make it look as though it goes up to the year 2000.

07:50.820 --> 07:53.220
The scale's been changed.

07:53.220 --> 07:57.500
You can see that more clearly when I match the two graphs up.

07:57.500 --> 08:01.740
Notice how the doctored graph ends short of the recent period of warming, but the date

08:01.740 --> 08:05.060
has been changed to 2000.

08:05.060 --> 08:10.220
So in the doctored graph, 30 years of warming is simply airbrushed out, and the scale moved

08:10.220 --> 08:14.660
up to make it look as though it's a record that reaches to the present.

08:14.660 --> 08:19.340
As for the second graph, it comes from a 2007 paper by Craig Lurell that's been widely

08:19.340 --> 08:21.420
circulated on the net.

08:21.420 --> 08:26.740
It seems to show proxy temperature data going up to the year 2000, and a medieval warm period

08:26.740 --> 08:29.540
that's clearly warmer than the present.

08:29.540 --> 08:35.660
But Lurell misunderstood the paleoclimatologist's convention of using 1950 as a benchmark to

08:35.660 --> 08:41.060
denote the present, and wrongly calibrated the temperature data to 2000.

08:41.060 --> 08:45.940
So his graph once again misses the recent decades of strong warming.

08:45.940 --> 08:51.460
After this was pointed out, Lurell corrected the errors in a 2008 paper, producing a reconstruction

08:51.460 --> 08:54.540
that this time ended in the correct date.

08:54.540 --> 08:59.880
When recent temperature records are added, his reconstruction, shown in pink here, conforms

08:59.880 --> 09:03.460
to others and shows the same familiar pattern.

09:03.460 --> 09:08.940
Warming during the medieval period, then rapid warming at the end of the 20th century, culminating

09:08.940 --> 09:10.420
in higher temperatures.

09:10.420 --> 09:14.420
Finally, here's a graph that must be familiar.

09:14.420 --> 09:19.540
If we look back further in time, before the Little Ice Age, we find a balmy golden era,

09:19.540 --> 09:24.100
when temperatures were higher than they are today, a time known to climatologists as the

09:24.100 --> 09:25.680
medieval warm period.

09:25.680 --> 09:29.580
This graph shows the medieval warm period and the Little Ice Age.

09:29.580 --> 09:33.940
But it's hard to create a panic about warming when temperatures today are below historical

09:33.940 --> 09:34.940
levels.

09:34.940 --> 09:37.820
About 800 years ago, they had the medieval warm period.

09:37.820 --> 09:41.420
This is mainstream science, this is not me coming up with alternative stuff.

09:41.420 --> 09:45.860
Believe it or not, this poster child for the medieval warm period comes from the arch nemesis

09:45.860 --> 09:48.580
of climate science critics, the IPCC.

09:48.580 --> 09:52.300
First, a few facts about this graph.

09:52.300 --> 09:56.340
This isn't a quantitative reconstruction, it's a schematic.

09:56.340 --> 10:00.980
There's no temperature scale on the y-axis, and most of the data seems to come from just

10:00.980 --> 10:02.860
one location.

10:02.860 --> 10:07.980
I say seems, because no one knows for sure where the data for this sketch comes from.

10:07.980 --> 10:13.500
McIntyre concluded it probably came from a 1965 paper by Lamb, which was mostly based

10:13.500 --> 10:16.420
on the temperature record of central England.

10:16.420 --> 10:20.960
Phil Jones also concluded it must have come from Lamb, combined with an approximation

10:20.960 --> 10:26.420
of temperatures in Western Europe based on historical and anecdotal evidence.

10:26.420 --> 10:31.620
So whatever the author of this sketch might claim, this doesn't represent global temperatures,

10:31.780 --> 10:34.300
because it's not based on global data.

10:34.300 --> 10:37.700
Finally, the graph ends in 1950.

10:37.700 --> 10:42.300
As Lowell discovered when he had to make his correction, that's what before present means

10:42.300 --> 10:47.300
in paleoclimatology, as well as in geology and geography.

10:47.300 --> 10:53.180
Under other circumstances, this kind of IPCC sloppiness would be labelled sketchgate, but

10:53.180 --> 10:58.260
instead the schematic has been accepted as an unalterable truth, and become the basis

10:58.260 --> 11:01.060
for a huge conspiracy theory.

11:01.060 --> 11:06.420
Perhaps not understanding that science always moves forward as new evidence comes along,

11:06.420 --> 11:10.860
the critics couldn't understand why the graph took on a completely different shape

11:10.860 --> 11:15.020
in an updated IPCC report ten years later.

11:15.020 --> 11:20.100
Their conclusion was that there must be a plot to abolish the medieval warm period.

11:20.100 --> 11:26.060
Just eleven years later, in 2001, this graph appeared.

11:26.060 --> 11:27.540
No medieval warm period.

11:27.540 --> 11:32.300
A small cadre of climate researchers set out to eliminate the medieval warm period from

11:32.300 --> 11:33.780
the historical record.

11:33.780 --> 11:37.760
The supposed official view, which is that they've abolished the medieval warm period.

11:37.760 --> 11:42.000
Of course, this conspiracy theory makes no sense in view of the huge amount of research

11:42.000 --> 11:47.340
that's been done in unveiling the extent of the medieval warm period, but just to explain

11:47.340 --> 11:53.140
to those who are still puzzled about why the shape of the graph changed, here it is again.

11:53.140 --> 11:58.220
This was based mostly on a temperature record from just one location in central England.

11:58.220 --> 12:02.500
This was based on data across the entire northern hemisphere.

12:02.500 --> 12:07.860
This schematic ended in 1950, long before the recent period of warming began.

12:07.860 --> 12:13.460
This reconstruction ended in the 1990s and included some of the recent warming.

12:13.460 --> 12:18.900
This reconstruction is a schematic of unknown provenance with no temperature scale.

12:18.900 --> 12:23.380
This was a first attempt at a quantitative reconstruction based on a limited number of

12:23.380 --> 12:27.260
proxies with a very large margin of error.

12:27.260 --> 12:33.540
And this reconstruction has itself been replaced by even more detailed and accurate reconstructions.

12:33.540 --> 12:38.780
The thing is, all scientific understanding progresses from uncertainty towards certainty,

12:38.780 --> 12:41.980
and is fraught with flaws and inaccuracies along the way.

12:41.980 --> 12:46.820
Yes, all science, from an understanding of what our universe looks like, to the climatic

12:46.820 --> 12:50.500
history of the earth, to the make-up of the atom.

12:50.500 --> 12:53.300
As I showed in my video, the scientific method made easy.

12:53.300 --> 12:58.060
If we take the most illustrative science, cartography, we can see very clearly how our

12:58.060 --> 13:04.260
understanding of the shape of the North American continent changed over a period of 500 years.

13:04.260 --> 13:09.720
Every single map is imperfect, and it's still imperfect, but at the same time our understanding

13:09.720 --> 13:12.580
of the shape got better and better.

13:12.580 --> 13:16.340
There's nothing wrong with this schematic, as long as you understand that it is just

13:16.340 --> 13:20.640
a schematic, and it doesn't include the recent period of warming.

13:20.640 --> 13:25.840
What you can't do is treat it as an unalterable truth about global temperatures, and pretend

13:25.840 --> 13:28.900
that it includes the last 35 years of warming.

13:28.900 --> 13:33.860
Which, of course, is exactly what a lot of people are doing.

13:33.860 --> 13:35.700
And now we come to the last question.

13:35.700 --> 13:37.800
What does all this mean anyway?

13:37.800 --> 13:42.240
Why are the critics of climate science so determined to have a warmer medieval warm

13:42.240 --> 13:43.240
period?

13:43.240 --> 13:44.760
Well, let's ask them.

13:44.760 --> 13:48.120
We cannot safely say that today's temperatures are exceptional.

13:48.120 --> 13:51.120
So that there's nothing special about today's temperatures.

13:51.120 --> 13:55.680
OK, but you don't need a congressional inquiry, an investigation by the National Academy of

13:55.680 --> 13:59.200
Sciences and an internet squabble to tell you that.

13:59.200 --> 14:04.180
A basic geology textbook could explain there's nothing special about today's temperatures.

14:04.180 --> 14:08.700
The Earth has been much colder in the past, and much warmer in the past, and even the

14:08.700 --> 14:10.780
same in the past.

14:10.780 --> 14:14.180
Geologists have been researching and banging on about extreme climates in the past for

14:14.180 --> 14:16.500
at least two centuries.

14:16.500 --> 14:21.380
Never mind the medieval warm period, what about the Eocene Thermal Optimum, 55 million

14:21.380 --> 14:27.000
years ago, when the Arctic Ocean was completely ice-free and subtropical?

14:27.000 --> 14:31.140
If all you're looking for is evidence of hotter climates in the past, what about the Permian

14:31.140 --> 14:35.700
Triassic, when global temperatures soared more than 14 degrees Fahrenheit warmer than

14:35.700 --> 14:36.920
today?

14:36.920 --> 14:41.300
So unless the climate critics are completely clueless about the climatic history of our

14:41.300 --> 14:46.260
planet, surely they can't be struggling for examples of warmer climates in the past.

14:46.260 --> 14:47.900
So let's try another reason.

14:47.900 --> 14:52.220
We can say, because everybody agrees this, that it was nature that caused the medieval

14:52.220 --> 14:53.220
climate warming.

14:53.220 --> 14:55.840
There was virtually nobody who would try to maintain that we were having enough of an

14:55.840 --> 14:58.460
influence on climate then to cause that warming.

14:58.460 --> 15:04.300
Joanne Nova says, temperatures were higher 1,000 years ago and cooler 300 years ago.

15:04.300 --> 15:08.260
We started warming long before cars and power stations were invented.

15:08.260 --> 15:11.340
There's little correlation with CO2 levels.

15:11.340 --> 15:16.660
But of course no one's suggested that the medieval warm period was caused by CO2 levels,

15:16.660 --> 15:21.700
and as I've explained many times in my videos, carbon dioxide isn't the only factor that

15:21.700 --> 15:23.700
drives global temperatures.

15:23.700 --> 15:26.540
I'm surprised Joanne Nova doesn't know that.

15:26.540 --> 15:30.980
She's got one of the most widely read climate blogs out there.

15:30.980 --> 15:34.400
But then this has been explained so often to those who think climate science is all

15:34.400 --> 15:38.380
about CO2 that I'm sure they understand it by now.

15:38.380 --> 15:43.100
The feigned ignorance is probably because, well, if you can't use the old didn't have

15:43.100 --> 15:46.980
SUVs in the Middle Ages argument, then what else is there?

15:46.980 --> 15:55.300
What caused the temperature to be higher in the medieval warm period than it is now?

15:55.300 --> 15:58.100
Could it have been turbocharged hand carts?

15:58.100 --> 16:02.020
If critics want to use the medieval warm period to show there are causes of climate change

16:02.020 --> 16:07.580
other than CO2, yet again climatologists have been explaining this for decades.

16:07.580 --> 16:12.640
And yes, that fact can still be found in every basic geography textbook.

16:12.640 --> 16:17.380
I've listed the main factors affecting climate in at least three of my videos, so this is

16:17.380 --> 16:22.540
true whether the medieval warm period was warmer or cooler than today.

16:22.540 --> 16:27.580
So if it wasn't carbon dioxide, what was the cause of the medieval warm period?

16:27.580 --> 16:32.660
Well, climatologists think a combination of factors now looks likely, but the climate

16:32.660 --> 16:35.460
science critics do have an explanation.

16:35.460 --> 16:42.260
So, if we assume that there were not enough 4x4s and SUVs driving around in the medieval

16:42.260 --> 16:47.660
warm period, what natural causes might there have been for the climate fluctuations over

16:47.660 --> 16:52.700
the past thousand years, which we now have really rather good grounds, I hope you'll

16:52.700 --> 16:56.060
agree, for suspecting may actually have occurred?

16:56.060 --> 17:02.580
Well now we'll go on and have a look at one possible guilty party, and that's the sun,

17:02.580 --> 17:05.620
which is where, after all, the heat comes from.

17:05.620 --> 17:12.820
It just so happens that during the medieval warm period, there was a period of increased

17:12.820 --> 17:14.360
solar radiation.

17:14.360 --> 17:17.300
It is the sun that does it, not man.

17:17.300 --> 17:22.440
When sunspot activity is compared to temperature changes over the same period, a remarkable

17:22.440 --> 17:24.160
correlation appears.

17:24.160 --> 17:28.540
If that's the reason critics want to give for the medieval warm period, and some researchers

17:28.540 --> 17:33.340
agree, then we can say with confidence that it can't be the reason for the rise in temperatures

17:33.340 --> 17:39.260
we've seen over the last 35 years, because solar irradiation has been relatively stable

17:39.260 --> 17:44.980
for the last 50 years and has even been in decline, so something else must be pushing

17:44.980 --> 17:46.940
up temperatures.

17:46.940 --> 17:48.720
And finally, there's this argument.

17:48.720 --> 17:54.020
In the 13th century, we were probably 7 degrees Fahrenheit warmer than we are now, and it

17:54.020 --> 17:56.500
was a very prosperous time for mankind.

17:56.500 --> 17:58.000
The barmy golden era.

17:58.000 --> 18:01.340
It was rather nice and big cathedrals were built all over Europe.

18:01.340 --> 18:06.940
In fact, wherever you describe this warm period, it appears to be associated with witches.

18:06.940 --> 18:07.940
With witches?

18:07.940 --> 18:09.580
Are you sure?

18:09.580 --> 18:12.340
Well where was it nice and associated with witches?

18:12.340 --> 18:15.700
We have established colonies in southern Greenland.

18:15.700 --> 18:20.500
Right in the 10th century, the Vikings settled in Greenland.

18:20.500 --> 18:25.380
They found fertile fields and navigable waters teeming with codfish and seals.

18:25.380 --> 18:29.140
OK, it was nice in Greenland, and the Vikings colonized it.

18:29.140 --> 18:30.140
Where else?

18:30.140 --> 18:31.140
We're having a heatwave.

18:31.140 --> 18:35.060
In Europe, this was the great age of the cathedral builders.

18:35.060 --> 18:40.540
Yes, we already know things were nice in Western Europe, vineyards in England, and so on.

18:40.540 --> 18:45.380
Back then it was warmer, there was more trees, it was a very good farming land, very fast

18:45.420 --> 18:48.140
Hang on, you're talking about Greenland again.

18:48.140 --> 18:52.300
I want to know what the rest of the world was like during the medieval warm period.

18:52.300 --> 18:57.180
It may be very nice for Greenlanders, but most people don't live in Greenland.

18:57.180 --> 19:02.540
How come we're never given examples of barmy, wonderful riches anywhere else in the world?

19:02.540 --> 19:08.040
Well the reason could be because not everywhere was like Western Europe.

19:08.040 --> 19:12.100
One of the best known and best researched examples is North America, which certainly

19:12.100 --> 19:17.500
seems to have warmed during the medieval warm period, but it also got a lot drier.

19:17.500 --> 19:22.020
So dry that researchers are referring to conditions as a megadrought.

19:22.020 --> 19:26.260
And as more research is done into the medieval warm period, coincident drought is turning

19:26.260 --> 19:30.360
up in areas as far afield as China and Amazonia.

19:30.360 --> 19:34.900
And this is exactly what computer modellers had predicted as the consequence of the current

19:34.900 --> 19:39.640
increase in temperatures, an increasing drought spreading out from the southwestern United

19:39.640 --> 19:44.080
States that will eventually encompass much of the grain belt.

19:44.080 --> 19:49.060
And as in the medieval warm period, other parts of the world will also become drier.

19:49.060 --> 19:53.880
But here's the good news that somewhat vindicates those who say the medieval warm period was

19:53.880 --> 19:57.520
a golden barmy era full of riches.

19:57.520 --> 19:58.640
Greenland's going to be lovely.
