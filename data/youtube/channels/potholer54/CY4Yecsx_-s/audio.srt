1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,880
Ah, that putative medieval warm period.

2
00:00:03,880 --> 00:00:06,720
It was local and didn't have much effect.

3
00:00:06,720 --> 00:00:11,240
Or it was global, much warmer than today, and proof that carbon dioxide doesn't cause

4
00:00:11,240 --> 00:00:12,800
global warming.

5
00:00:12,800 --> 00:00:15,440
It depends on what you believe, doesn't it?

6
00:00:15,440 --> 00:00:20,820
Well, as in all areas of science, no, it depends on what the evidence shows.

7
00:00:20,820 --> 00:00:25,300
So in this video I want to look at the evidence for the medieval warm period that answers

8
00:00:25,300 --> 00:00:27,560
three basic questions.

9
00:00:27,560 --> 00:00:28,780
Was it global?

10
00:00:28,780 --> 00:00:30,460
Was it warmer than today?

11
00:00:30,460 --> 00:00:32,960
And what does all this matter anyway?

12
00:00:32,960 --> 00:00:36,780
And of course along the way we'll look at the strange and divisive battle over the hockey

13
00:00:36,780 --> 00:00:37,780
stick.

14
00:00:37,780 --> 00:00:39,820
But let's start with a familiar face.

15
00:00:39,820 --> 00:00:46,340
Seven hundred scientists from more than four hundred institutions in more than forty countries

16
00:00:46,340 --> 00:00:50,660
in the last twenty years have contributed to papers that I know about and can on notice

17
00:00:50,660 --> 00:00:57,140
list saying that the medieval warm period, which is well known in history and archaeology

18
00:00:57,140 --> 00:01:04,300
as it is in climate science, was real, was global and was noticeably warmer than the

19
00:01:04,300 --> 00:01:05,300
present.

20
00:01:05,300 --> 00:01:09,180
Moncton was as good as his word and when I asked him for the list he gave it to me.

21
00:01:09,180 --> 00:01:13,580
Unfortunately I'm probably the only person who ever asked him because the list doesn't

22
00:01:13,580 --> 00:01:15,340
live up to his claim.

23
00:01:15,340 --> 00:01:20,180
The seven hundred scientists who contribute to the papers listed don't say the medieval

24
00:01:20,180 --> 00:01:25,860
warm period was real, global and noticeably warmer than today or anything like it.

25
00:01:25,860 --> 00:01:31,200
If you don't believe me, you'll find the list of papers on the CO2science.org website,

26
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:35,360
so by all means read through them and see how many you have to read before you can find

27
00:01:35,360 --> 00:01:39,100
a single one that says what Moncton claims it says.

28
00:01:39,100 --> 00:01:42,840
Of course there's no doubt there was a warming event around eleven hundred to eight hundred

29
00:01:42,840 --> 00:01:43,840
years ago.

30
00:01:43,840 --> 00:01:46,340
That's been known for at least fifty years.

31
00:01:46,340 --> 00:01:51,740
The question has always been was this localised warming or was it a global event?

32
00:01:51,740 --> 00:01:55,260
At first the warming was thought to have been limited to the North Atlantic and Western

33
00:01:55,260 --> 00:01:59,940
Europe because the evidence from historical records was so clear.

34
00:01:59,940 --> 00:02:03,780
Even now we have a lot of evidence from the Northern Hemisphere but very little from the

35
00:02:03,780 --> 00:02:08,320
Southern Hemisphere but I think it's fair to say that the more evidence that comes in,

36
00:02:08,320 --> 00:02:13,140
the more it does support the idea that this event was global.

37
00:02:13,140 --> 00:02:16,140
So the next question is was it warmer than today?

38
00:02:16,140 --> 00:02:18,220
Craig Izzo believes it was.

39
00:02:18,220 --> 00:02:22,880
He's the man who collected all those papers that Moncton misquoted but only some of them

40
00:02:22,880 --> 00:02:27,000
quantify the amount of warming during the medieval warm period and not all of those

41
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:29,920
compared it to the recent period of warming.

42
00:02:29,920 --> 00:02:34,720
A proper analysis has to look at studies that are geographically diverse and compare the

43
00:02:34,720 --> 00:02:39,900
medieval warm period to the present, not twenty, thirty or fifty years ago.

44
00:02:39,900 --> 00:02:45,160
That was first done in 1998 for the Northern Hemisphere by Mann, Bradley and Hughes and

45
00:02:45,160 --> 00:02:47,260
the hockey stick was born.

46
00:02:47,260 --> 00:02:51,820
The following year they published another paper extending the timeline back to 1000

47
00:02:51,820 --> 00:02:52,820
AD.

48
00:02:52,820 --> 00:02:57,100
Actually, it's only a hockey stick if you eliminate the error bars because there was

49
00:02:57,100 --> 00:03:00,340
still a lot of uncertainty in the proxies used.

50
00:03:00,340 --> 00:03:06,740
In 2004 various flaws were highlighted in a rebuttal paper by Steve McIntyre and Ross

51
00:03:06,740 --> 00:03:07,820
McKittrick.

52
00:03:07,820 --> 00:03:12,060
They criticised the over-reliance on tree ring data and suggested the hockey stick's

53
00:03:12,060 --> 00:03:18,220
shape was created artificially because of an incorrect statistical analysis.

54
00:03:18,220 --> 00:03:21,420
To sort out the controversy there were two investigations.

55
00:03:21,420 --> 00:03:25,860
Congress commissioned a report by the National Academy of Sciences which confirmed a lot

56
00:03:25,860 --> 00:03:31,040
of the uncertainties in the proxies used but found the conclusions plausible.

57
00:03:31,040 --> 00:03:35,560
The House Committee on Energy and Commerce commissioned a report by Statistics Professor

58
00:03:35,560 --> 00:03:37,220
Edward Wegman.

59
00:03:37,220 --> 00:03:41,900
The Wegman report is controversial because it delved into areas outside of Wegman's

60
00:03:41,900 --> 00:03:46,900
expertise as a statistician and a lot of it was later found to have been plagiarised,

61
00:03:46,900 --> 00:03:49,060
in part from Wikipedia.

62
00:03:49,060 --> 00:03:53,100
For this reason it was withdrawn by the journal in which it was published.

63
00:03:53,100 --> 00:03:57,860
But I can't see that this invalidates Wegman's conclusions on the statistics, which after

64
00:03:57,860 --> 00:04:00,580
all is his field of expertise.

65
00:04:00,580 --> 00:04:05,540
He concluded that the main point of controversy was that Mann, Bradley and Hughes, collectively

66
00:04:05,540 --> 00:04:11,380
known as MBH, had centred the mean for their reconstruction in the 20th century rather

67
00:04:11,380 --> 00:04:13,300
than the entire timeline.

68
00:04:13,300 --> 00:04:18,820
MBH themselves accepted the errors that were validated and corrected their reconstruction

69
00:04:18,820 --> 00:04:19,820
in 2008.

70
00:04:19,820 --> 00:04:24,900
I won't go into the details of either congressional report because even by the time they were

71
00:04:24,900 --> 00:04:28,100
commissioned they were largely irrelevant.

72
00:04:28,100 --> 00:04:34,420
Several more reconstructions had been published by then and these superseded MBH 1999 using

73
00:04:34,420 --> 00:04:39,620
a wealth of new proxy data with and without the controversial tree rings.

74
00:04:39,620 --> 00:04:43,700
Whether you want to continue calling these reconstructions hockey sticks doesn't really

75
00:04:43,700 --> 00:04:44,700
matter.

76
00:04:44,700 --> 00:04:49,040
What climatologists see is the same pattern in all of them, warming during the medieval

77
00:04:49,040 --> 00:04:53,900
warm period and then a steep acceleration of warming at the end of the 20th and early

78
00:04:53,900 --> 00:04:55,700
21st centuries.

79
00:04:55,700 --> 00:05:00,900
Perhaps the best sign of how seriously climate science critics are taking these later reconstructions

80
00:05:00,900 --> 00:05:05,380
is that they are not being debunked because of errors and flaws or accusations of fraud.

81
00:05:05,380 --> 00:05:07,700
They are being doctored.

82
00:05:07,700 --> 00:05:12,780
Take for example the most recent reconstruction by Esper et al using tree rings from northern

83
00:05:12,780 --> 00:05:14,420
Scandinavia.

84
00:05:14,420 --> 00:05:17,600
The study prompted this headline in the Daily Mail.

85
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:22,260
Tree rings prove climate was warmer in Roman and medieval times than it is now.

86
00:05:22,260 --> 00:05:25,100
Well in northern Scandinavia at least.

87
00:05:25,100 --> 00:05:29,900
And the Daily Mail has a graph purportedly taken from the paper to prove it.

88
00:05:29,900 --> 00:05:35,160
The story was written by someone who has been designated the Daily Mail's science reporter.

89
00:05:35,160 --> 00:05:40,380
But if we check Esper's paper, no surprise, it doesn't agree with the headline.

90
00:05:40,380 --> 00:05:45,100
This is the reconstruction shown in the paper, with recent temperatures from northern Scandinavia

91
00:05:45,100 --> 00:05:46,740
shown in red.

92
00:05:46,740 --> 00:05:51,860
In the Mail's story and other blogs, the recent temperature data have been erased.

93
00:05:51,860 --> 00:05:56,340
Airbrushing out recent temperature rises has become something of an art form among bloggers.

94
00:05:56,820 --> 00:06:01,020
Here's a 2000 year reconstruction, as explained by meteorologist Art Horn.

95
00:06:01,020 --> 00:06:05,020
Back in the medieval warm period it was as warm or warmer than today back in part of

96
00:06:05,020 --> 00:06:06,020
the Roman Empire.

97
00:06:06,020 --> 00:06:09,820
In the Roman warm period it was as warm or warmer than today.

98
00:06:09,820 --> 00:06:13,020
Horn seems to draw this conclusion from the graph he shows.

99
00:06:13,020 --> 00:06:19,860
I tracked it down to Craig Idso's website, CO2Science, where it was adapted from a 2010

100
00:06:19,860 --> 00:06:21,980
paper by Lundqvist.

101
00:06:21,980 --> 00:06:27,020
But how did Horn conclude that the reconstruction shows a warmer medieval warm period when the

102
00:06:27,020 --> 00:06:29,500
author himself doesn't?

103
00:06:29,500 --> 00:06:33,740
Lundqvist says the last two decades have been possibly hotter than at any time over the

104
00:06:33,740 --> 00:06:35,500
last 2000 years.

105
00:06:35,500 --> 00:06:38,020
Can't Lundqvist read his own graph?

106
00:06:38,020 --> 00:06:41,660
No, it turns out this isn't Lundqvist's graph.

107
00:06:41,660 --> 00:06:43,100
It's been doctored.

108
00:06:43,100 --> 00:06:45,660
That's what adapted means in this case.

109
00:06:45,660 --> 00:06:49,700
The high temperatures of the last few decades have been airbrushed out.

110
00:06:50,580 --> 00:06:53,900
Here's the original as it appeared in Lundqvist's paper.

111
00:06:53,900 --> 00:06:58,460
Here are two more 2000 year reconstructions doing the rounds of the blogosphere.

112
00:06:58,460 --> 00:07:02,260
Several folks have tried to step back from the man hockey team approach and to use a

113
00:07:02,260 --> 00:07:05,300
more fair selection of less controversial proxies.

114
00:07:05,300 --> 00:07:09,860
Two such researchers are Moberg, who is generally considered a strong global warming supporter,

115
00:07:09,860 --> 00:07:12,100
and Lowell, who is more of a sceptic.

116
00:07:12,100 --> 00:07:14,580
And lo and behold, it comes right back to where we started.

117
00:07:14,580 --> 00:07:19,100
We get the medieval warm period around 1000, we get a little ice age, and the temperature

118
00:07:19,100 --> 00:07:22,460
today is similar or even lower than those in the Middle Ages.

119
00:07:22,460 --> 00:07:27,220
Let's take the graph on the left first, which narrator Warren Meyer says comes from Moberg's

120
00:07:27,220 --> 00:07:29,540
2005 study.

121
00:07:29,540 --> 00:07:32,260
But of course it's been adapted.

122
00:07:32,260 --> 00:07:36,820
If we look at Moberg's original, we can see that the instrumental temperature data showing

123
00:07:36,820 --> 00:07:40,460
late 20th century warming has been erased.

124
00:07:40,460 --> 00:07:45,220
Worse than that, Moberg's proxy data, that he says in the caption goes back as far as

125
00:07:45,220 --> 00:07:50,820
1979, is extended to make it look as though it goes up to the year 2000.

126
00:07:50,820 --> 00:07:53,220
The scale's been changed.

127
00:07:53,220 --> 00:07:57,500
You can see that more clearly when I match the two graphs up.

128
00:07:57,500 --> 00:08:01,740
Notice how the doctored graph ends short of the recent period of warming, but the date

129
00:08:01,740 --> 00:08:05,060
has been changed to 2000.

130
00:08:05,060 --> 00:08:10,220
So in the doctored graph, 30 years of warming is simply airbrushed out, and the scale moved

131
00:08:10,220 --> 00:08:14,660
up to make it look as though it's a record that reaches to the present.

132
00:08:14,660 --> 00:08:19,340
As for the second graph, it comes from a 2007 paper by Craig Lurell that's been widely

133
00:08:19,340 --> 00:08:21,420
circulated on the net.

134
00:08:21,420 --> 00:08:26,740
It seems to show proxy temperature data going up to the year 2000, and a medieval warm period

135
00:08:26,740 --> 00:08:29,540
that's clearly warmer than the present.

136
00:08:29,540 --> 00:08:35,660
But Lurell misunderstood the paleoclimatologist's convention of using 1950 as a benchmark to

137
00:08:35,660 --> 00:08:41,060
denote the present, and wrongly calibrated the temperature data to 2000.

138
00:08:41,060 --> 00:08:45,940
So his graph once again misses the recent decades of strong warming.

139
00:08:45,940 --> 00:08:51,460
After this was pointed out, Lurell corrected the errors in a 2008 paper, producing a reconstruction

140
00:08:51,460 --> 00:08:54,540
that this time ended in the correct date.

141
00:08:54,540 --> 00:08:59,880
When recent temperature records are added, his reconstruction, shown in pink here, conforms

142
00:08:59,880 --> 00:09:03,460
to others and shows the same familiar pattern.

143
00:09:03,460 --> 00:09:08,940
Warming during the medieval period, then rapid warming at the end of the 20th century, culminating

144
00:09:08,940 --> 00:09:10,420
in higher temperatures.

145
00:09:10,420 --> 00:09:14,420
Finally, here's a graph that must be familiar.

146
00:09:14,420 --> 00:09:19,540
If we look back further in time, before the Little Ice Age, we find a balmy golden era,

147
00:09:19,540 --> 00:09:24,100
when temperatures were higher than they are today, a time known to climatologists as the

148
00:09:24,100 --> 00:09:25,680
medieval warm period.

149
00:09:25,680 --> 00:09:29,580
This graph shows the medieval warm period and the Little Ice Age.

150
00:09:29,580 --> 00:09:33,940
But it's hard to create a panic about warming when temperatures today are below historical

151
00:09:33,940 --> 00:09:34,940
levels.

152
00:09:34,940 --> 00:09:37,820
About 800 years ago, they had the medieval warm period.

153
00:09:37,820 --> 00:09:41,420
This is mainstream science, this is not me coming up with alternative stuff.

154
00:09:41,420 --> 00:09:45,860
Believe it or not, this poster child for the medieval warm period comes from the arch nemesis

155
00:09:45,860 --> 00:09:48,580
of climate science critics, the IPCC.

156
00:09:48,580 --> 00:09:52,300
First, a few facts about this graph.

157
00:09:52,300 --> 00:09:56,340
This isn't a quantitative reconstruction, it's a schematic.

158
00:09:56,340 --> 00:10:00,980
There's no temperature scale on the y-axis, and most of the data seems to come from just

159
00:10:00,980 --> 00:10:02,860
one location.

160
00:10:02,860 --> 00:10:07,980
I say seems, because no one knows for sure where the data for this sketch comes from.

161
00:10:07,980 --> 00:10:13,500
McIntyre concluded it probably came from a 1965 paper by Lamb, which was mostly based

162
00:10:13,500 --> 00:10:16,420
on the temperature record of central England.

163
00:10:16,420 --> 00:10:20,960
Phil Jones also concluded it must have come from Lamb, combined with an approximation

164
00:10:20,960 --> 00:10:26,420
of temperatures in Western Europe based on historical and anecdotal evidence.

165
00:10:26,420 --> 00:10:31,620
So whatever the author of this sketch might claim, this doesn't represent global temperatures,

166
00:10:31,780 --> 00:10:34,300
because it's not based on global data.

167
00:10:34,300 --> 00:10:37,700
Finally, the graph ends in 1950.

168
00:10:37,700 --> 00:10:42,300
As Lowell discovered when he had to make his correction, that's what before present means

169
00:10:42,300 --> 00:10:47,300
in paleoclimatology, as well as in geology and geography.

170
00:10:47,300 --> 00:10:53,180
Under other circumstances, this kind of IPCC sloppiness would be labelled sketchgate, but

171
00:10:53,180 --> 00:10:58,260
instead the schematic has been accepted as an unalterable truth, and become the basis

172
00:10:58,260 --> 00:11:01,060
for a huge conspiracy theory.

173
00:11:01,060 --> 00:11:06,420
Perhaps not understanding that science always moves forward as new evidence comes along,

174
00:11:06,420 --> 00:11:10,860
the critics couldn't understand why the graph took on a completely different shape

175
00:11:10,860 --> 00:11:15,020
in an updated IPCC report ten years later.

176
00:11:15,020 --> 00:11:20,100
Their conclusion was that there must be a plot to abolish the medieval warm period.

177
00:11:20,100 --> 00:11:26,060
Just eleven years later, in 2001, this graph appeared.

178
00:11:26,060 --> 00:11:27,540
No medieval warm period.

179
00:11:27,540 --> 00:11:32,300
A small cadre of climate researchers set out to eliminate the medieval warm period from

180
00:11:32,300 --> 00:11:33,780
the historical record.

181
00:11:33,780 --> 00:11:37,760
The supposed official view, which is that they've abolished the medieval warm period.

182
00:11:37,760 --> 00:11:42,000
Of course, this conspiracy theory makes no sense in view of the huge amount of research

183
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:47,340
that's been done in unveiling the extent of the medieval warm period, but just to explain

184
00:11:47,340 --> 00:11:53,140
to those who are still puzzled about why the shape of the graph changed, here it is again.

185
00:11:53,140 --> 00:11:58,220
This was based mostly on a temperature record from just one location in central England.

186
00:11:58,220 --> 00:12:02,500
This was based on data across the entire northern hemisphere.

187
00:12:02,500 --> 00:12:07,860
This schematic ended in 1950, long before the recent period of warming began.

188
00:12:07,860 --> 00:12:13,460
This reconstruction ended in the 1990s and included some of the recent warming.

189
00:12:13,460 --> 00:12:18,900
This reconstruction is a schematic of unknown provenance with no temperature scale.

190
00:12:18,900 --> 00:12:23,380
This was a first attempt at a quantitative reconstruction based on a limited number of

191
00:12:23,380 --> 00:12:27,260
proxies with a very large margin of error.

192
00:12:27,260 --> 00:12:33,540
And this reconstruction has itself been replaced by even more detailed and accurate reconstructions.

193
00:12:33,540 --> 00:12:38,780
The thing is, all scientific understanding progresses from uncertainty towards certainty,

194
00:12:38,780 --> 00:12:41,980
and is fraught with flaws and inaccuracies along the way.

195
00:12:41,980 --> 00:12:46,820
Yes, all science, from an understanding of what our universe looks like, to the climatic

196
00:12:46,820 --> 00:12:50,500
history of the earth, to the make-up of the atom.

197
00:12:50,500 --> 00:12:53,300
As I showed in my video, the scientific method made easy.

198
00:12:53,300 --> 00:12:58,060
If we take the most illustrative science, cartography, we can see very clearly how our

199
00:12:58,060 --> 00:13:04,260
understanding of the shape of the North American continent changed over a period of 500 years.

200
00:13:04,260 --> 00:13:09,720
Every single map is imperfect, and it's still imperfect, but at the same time our understanding

201
00:13:09,720 --> 00:13:12,580
of the shape got better and better.

202
00:13:12,580 --> 00:13:16,340
There's nothing wrong with this schematic, as long as you understand that it is just

203
00:13:16,340 --> 00:13:20,640
a schematic, and it doesn't include the recent period of warming.

204
00:13:20,640 --> 00:13:25,840
What you can't do is treat it as an unalterable truth about global temperatures, and pretend

205
00:13:25,840 --> 00:13:28,900
that it includes the last 35 years of warming.

206
00:13:28,900 --> 00:13:33,860
Which, of course, is exactly what a lot of people are doing.

207
00:13:33,860 --> 00:13:35,700
And now we come to the last question.

208
00:13:35,700 --> 00:13:37,800
What does all this mean anyway?

209
00:13:37,800 --> 00:13:42,240
Why are the critics of climate science so determined to have a warmer medieval warm

210
00:13:42,240 --> 00:13:43,240
period?

211
00:13:43,240 --> 00:13:44,760
Well, let's ask them.

212
00:13:44,760 --> 00:13:48,120
We cannot safely say that today's temperatures are exceptional.

213
00:13:48,120 --> 00:13:51,120
So that there's nothing special about today's temperatures.

214
00:13:51,120 --> 00:13:55,680
OK, but you don't need a congressional inquiry, an investigation by the National Academy of

215
00:13:55,680 --> 00:13:59,200
Sciences and an internet squabble to tell you that.

216
00:13:59,200 --> 00:14:04,180
A basic geology textbook could explain there's nothing special about today's temperatures.

217
00:14:04,180 --> 00:14:08,700
The Earth has been much colder in the past, and much warmer in the past, and even the

218
00:14:08,700 --> 00:14:10,780
same in the past.

219
00:14:10,780 --> 00:14:14,180
Geologists have been researching and banging on about extreme climates in the past for

220
00:14:14,180 --> 00:14:16,500
at least two centuries.

221
00:14:16,500 --> 00:14:21,380
Never mind the medieval warm period, what about the Eocene Thermal Optimum, 55 million

222
00:14:21,380 --> 00:14:27,000
years ago, when the Arctic Ocean was completely ice-free and subtropical?

223
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:31,140
If all you're looking for is evidence of hotter climates in the past, what about the Permian

224
00:14:31,140 --> 00:14:35,700
Triassic, when global temperatures soared more than 14 degrees Fahrenheit warmer than

225
00:14:35,700 --> 00:14:36,920
today?

226
00:14:36,920 --> 00:14:41,300
So unless the climate critics are completely clueless about the climatic history of our

227
00:14:41,300 --> 00:14:46,260
planet, surely they can't be struggling for examples of warmer climates in the past.

228
00:14:46,260 --> 00:14:47,900
So let's try another reason.

229
00:14:47,900 --> 00:14:52,220
We can say, because everybody agrees this, that it was nature that caused the medieval

230
00:14:52,220 --> 00:14:53,220
climate warming.

231
00:14:53,220 --> 00:14:55,840
There was virtually nobody who would try to maintain that we were having enough of an

232
00:14:55,840 --> 00:14:58,460
influence on climate then to cause that warming.

233
00:14:58,460 --> 00:15:04,300
Joanne Nova says, temperatures were higher 1,000 years ago and cooler 300 years ago.

234
00:15:04,300 --> 00:15:08,260
We started warming long before cars and power stations were invented.

235
00:15:08,260 --> 00:15:11,340
There's little correlation with CO2 levels.

236
00:15:11,340 --> 00:15:16,660
But of course no one's suggested that the medieval warm period was caused by CO2 levels,

237
00:15:16,660 --> 00:15:21,700
and as I've explained many times in my videos, carbon dioxide isn't the only factor that

238
00:15:21,700 --> 00:15:23,700
drives global temperatures.

239
00:15:23,700 --> 00:15:26,540
I'm surprised Joanne Nova doesn't know that.

240
00:15:26,540 --> 00:15:30,980
She's got one of the most widely read climate blogs out there.

241
00:15:30,980 --> 00:15:34,400
But then this has been explained so often to those who think climate science is all

242
00:15:34,400 --> 00:15:38,380
about CO2 that I'm sure they understand it by now.

243
00:15:38,380 --> 00:15:43,100
The feigned ignorance is probably because, well, if you can't use the old didn't have

244
00:15:43,100 --> 00:15:46,980
SUVs in the Middle Ages argument, then what else is there?

245
00:15:46,980 --> 00:15:55,300
What caused the temperature to be higher in the medieval warm period than it is now?

246
00:15:55,300 --> 00:15:58,100
Could it have been turbocharged hand carts?

247
00:15:58,100 --> 00:16:02,020
If critics want to use the medieval warm period to show there are causes of climate change

248
00:16:02,020 --> 00:16:07,580
other than CO2, yet again climatologists have been explaining this for decades.

249
00:16:07,580 --> 00:16:12,640
And yes, that fact can still be found in every basic geography textbook.

250
00:16:12,640 --> 00:16:17,380
I've listed the main factors affecting climate in at least three of my videos, so this is

251
00:16:17,380 --> 00:16:22,540
true whether the medieval warm period was warmer or cooler than today.

252
00:16:22,540 --> 00:16:27,580
So if it wasn't carbon dioxide, what was the cause of the medieval warm period?

253
00:16:27,580 --> 00:16:32,660
Well, climatologists think a combination of factors now looks likely, but the climate

254
00:16:32,660 --> 00:16:35,460
science critics do have an explanation.

255
00:16:35,460 --> 00:16:42,260
So, if we assume that there were not enough 4x4s and SUVs driving around in the medieval

256
00:16:42,260 --> 00:16:47,660
warm period, what natural causes might there have been for the climate fluctuations over

257
00:16:47,660 --> 00:16:52,700
the past thousand years, which we now have really rather good grounds, I hope you'll

258
00:16:52,700 --> 00:16:56,060
agree, for suspecting may actually have occurred?

259
00:16:56,060 --> 00:17:02,580
Well now we'll go on and have a look at one possible guilty party, and that's the sun,

260
00:17:02,580 --> 00:17:05,620
which is where, after all, the heat comes from.

261
00:17:05,620 --> 00:17:12,820
It just so happens that during the medieval warm period, there was a period of increased

262
00:17:12,820 --> 00:17:14,360
solar radiation.

263
00:17:14,360 --> 00:17:17,300
It is the sun that does it, not man.

264
00:17:17,300 --> 00:17:22,440
When sunspot activity is compared to temperature changes over the same period, a remarkable

265
00:17:22,440 --> 00:17:24,160
correlation appears.

266
00:17:24,160 --> 00:17:28,540
If that's the reason critics want to give for the medieval warm period, and some researchers

267
00:17:28,540 --> 00:17:33,340
agree, then we can say with confidence that it can't be the reason for the rise in temperatures

268
00:17:33,340 --> 00:17:39,260
we've seen over the last 35 years, because solar irradiation has been relatively stable

269
00:17:39,260 --> 00:17:44,980
for the last 50 years and has even been in decline, so something else must be pushing

270
00:17:44,980 --> 00:17:46,940
up temperatures.

271
00:17:46,940 --> 00:17:48,720
And finally, there's this argument.

272
00:17:48,720 --> 00:17:54,020
In the 13th century, we were probably 7 degrees Fahrenheit warmer than we are now, and it

273
00:17:54,020 --> 00:17:56,500
was a very prosperous time for mankind.

274
00:17:56,500 --> 00:17:58,000
The barmy golden era.

275
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:01,340
It was rather nice and big cathedrals were built all over Europe.

276
00:18:01,340 --> 00:18:06,940
In fact, wherever you describe this warm period, it appears to be associated with witches.

277
00:18:06,940 --> 00:18:07,940
With witches?

278
00:18:07,940 --> 00:18:09,580
Are you sure?

279
00:18:09,580 --> 00:18:12,340
Well where was it nice and associated with witches?

280
00:18:12,340 --> 00:18:15,700
We have established colonies in southern Greenland.

281
00:18:15,700 --> 00:18:20,500
Right in the 10th century, the Vikings settled in Greenland.

282
00:18:20,500 --> 00:18:25,380
They found fertile fields and navigable waters teeming with codfish and seals.

283
00:18:25,380 --> 00:18:29,140
OK, it was nice in Greenland, and the Vikings colonized it.

284
00:18:29,140 --> 00:18:30,140
Where else?

285
00:18:30,140 --> 00:18:31,140
We're having a heatwave.

286
00:18:31,140 --> 00:18:35,060
In Europe, this was the great age of the cathedral builders.

287
00:18:35,060 --> 00:18:40,540
Yes, we already know things were nice in Western Europe, vineyards in England, and so on.

288
00:18:40,540 --> 00:18:45,380
Back then it was warmer, there was more trees, it was a very good farming land, very fast

289
00:18:45,420 --> 00:18:48,140
Hang on, you're talking about Greenland again.

290
00:18:48,140 --> 00:18:52,300
I want to know what the rest of the world was like during the medieval warm period.

291
00:18:52,300 --> 00:18:57,180
It may be very nice for Greenlanders, but most people don't live in Greenland.

292
00:18:57,180 --> 00:19:02,540
How come we're never given examples of barmy, wonderful riches anywhere else in the world?

293
00:19:02,540 --> 00:19:08,040
Well the reason could be because not everywhere was like Western Europe.

294
00:19:08,040 --> 00:19:12,100
One of the best known and best researched examples is North America, which certainly

295
00:19:12,100 --> 00:19:17,500
seems to have warmed during the medieval warm period, but it also got a lot drier.

296
00:19:17,500 --> 00:19:22,020
So dry that researchers are referring to conditions as a megadrought.

297
00:19:22,020 --> 00:19:26,260
And as more research is done into the medieval warm period, coincident drought is turning

298
00:19:26,260 --> 00:19:30,360
up in areas as far afield as China and Amazonia.

299
00:19:30,360 --> 00:19:34,900
And this is exactly what computer modellers had predicted as the consequence of the current

300
00:19:34,900 --> 00:19:39,640
increase in temperatures, an increasing drought spreading out from the southwestern United

301
00:19:39,640 --> 00:19:44,080
States that will eventually encompass much of the grain belt.

302
00:19:44,080 --> 00:19:49,060
And as in the medieval warm period, other parts of the world will also become drier.

303
00:19:49,060 --> 00:19:53,880
But here's the good news that somewhat vindicates those who say the medieval warm period was

304
00:19:53,880 --> 00:19:57,520
a golden barmy era full of riches.

305
00:19:57,520 --> 00:19:58,640
Greenland's going to be lovely.
