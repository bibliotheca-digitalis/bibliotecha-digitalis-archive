0	3880	Ah, that putative medieval warm period.
3880	6720	It was local and didn't have much effect.
6720	11240	Or it was global, much warmer than today, and proof that carbon dioxide doesn't cause
11240	12800	global warming.
12800	15440	It depends on what you believe, doesn't it?
15440	20820	Well, as in all areas of science, no, it depends on what the evidence shows.
20820	25300	So in this video I want to look at the evidence for the medieval warm period that answers
25300	27560	three basic questions.
27560	28780	Was it global?
28780	30460	Was it warmer than today?
30460	32960	And what does all this matter anyway?
32960	36780	And of course along the way we'll look at the strange and divisive battle over the hockey
36780	37780	stick.
37780	39820	But let's start with a familiar face.
39820	46340	Seven hundred scientists from more than four hundred institutions in more than forty countries
46340	50660	in the last twenty years have contributed to papers that I know about and can on notice
50660	57140	list saying that the medieval warm period, which is well known in history and archaeology
57140	64300	as it is in climate science, was real, was global and was noticeably warmer than the
64300	65300	present.
65300	69180	Moncton was as good as his word and when I asked him for the list he gave it to me.
69180	73580	Unfortunately I'm probably the only person who ever asked him because the list doesn't
73580	75340	live up to his claim.
75340	80180	The seven hundred scientists who contribute to the papers listed don't say the medieval
80180	85860	warm period was real, global and noticeably warmer than today or anything like it.
85860	91200	If you don't believe me, you'll find the list of papers on the CO2science.org website,
91200	95360	so by all means read through them and see how many you have to read before you can find
95360	99100	a single one that says what Moncton claims it says.
99100	102840	Of course there's no doubt there was a warming event around eleven hundred to eight hundred
102840	103840	years ago.
103840	106340	That's been known for at least fifty years.
106340	111740	The question has always been was this localised warming or was it a global event?
111740	115260	At first the warming was thought to have been limited to the North Atlantic and Western
115260	119940	Europe because the evidence from historical records was so clear.
119940	123780	Even now we have a lot of evidence from the Northern Hemisphere but very little from the
123780	128320	Southern Hemisphere but I think it's fair to say that the more evidence that comes in,
128320	133140	the more it does support the idea that this event was global.
133140	136140	So the next question is was it warmer than today?
136140	138220	Craig Izzo believes it was.
138220	142880	He's the man who collected all those papers that Moncton misquoted but only some of them
142880	147000	quantify the amount of warming during the medieval warm period and not all of those
147000	149920	compared it to the recent period of warming.
149920	154720	A proper analysis has to look at studies that are geographically diverse and compare the
154720	159900	medieval warm period to the present, not twenty, thirty or fifty years ago.
159900	165160	That was first done in 1998 for the Northern Hemisphere by Mann, Bradley and Hughes and
165160	167260	the hockey stick was born.
167260	171820	The following year they published another paper extending the timeline back to 1000
171820	172820	AD.
172820	177100	Actually, it's only a hockey stick if you eliminate the error bars because there was
177100	180340	still a lot of uncertainty in the proxies used.
180340	186740	In 2004 various flaws were highlighted in a rebuttal paper by Steve McIntyre and Ross
186740	187820	McKittrick.
187820	192060	They criticised the over-reliance on tree ring data and suggested the hockey stick's
192060	198220	shape was created artificially because of an incorrect statistical analysis.
198220	201420	To sort out the controversy there were two investigations.
201420	205860	Congress commissioned a report by the National Academy of Sciences which confirmed a lot
205860	211040	of the uncertainties in the proxies used but found the conclusions plausible.
211040	215560	The House Committee on Energy and Commerce commissioned a report by Statistics Professor
215560	217220	Edward Wegman.
217220	221900	The Wegman report is controversial because it delved into areas outside of Wegman's
221900	226900	expertise as a statistician and a lot of it was later found to have been plagiarised,
226900	229060	in part from Wikipedia.
229060	233100	For this reason it was withdrawn by the journal in which it was published.
233100	237860	But I can't see that this invalidates Wegman's conclusions on the statistics, which after
237860	240580	all is his field of expertise.
240580	245540	He concluded that the main point of controversy was that Mann, Bradley and Hughes, collectively
245540	251380	known as MBH, had centred the mean for their reconstruction in the 20th century rather
251380	253300	than the entire timeline.
253300	258820	MBH themselves accepted the errors that were validated and corrected their reconstruction
258820	259820	in 2008.
259820	264900	I won't go into the details of either congressional report because even by the time they were
264900	268100	commissioned they were largely irrelevant.
268100	274420	Several more reconstructions had been published by then and these superseded MBH 1999 using
274420	279620	a wealth of new proxy data with and without the controversial tree rings.
279620	283700	Whether you want to continue calling these reconstructions hockey sticks doesn't really
283700	284700	matter.
284700	289040	What climatologists see is the same pattern in all of them, warming during the medieval
289040	293900	warm period and then a steep acceleration of warming at the end of the 20th and early
293900	295700	21st centuries.
295700	300900	Perhaps the best sign of how seriously climate science critics are taking these later reconstructions
300900	305380	is that they are not being debunked because of errors and flaws or accusations of fraud.
305380	307700	They are being doctored.
307700	312780	Take for example the most recent reconstruction by Esper et al using tree rings from northern
312780	314420	Scandinavia.
314420	317600	The study prompted this headline in the Daily Mail.
317600	322260	Tree rings prove climate was warmer in Roman and medieval times than it is now.
322260	325100	Well in northern Scandinavia at least.
325100	329900	And the Daily Mail has a graph purportedly taken from the paper to prove it.
329900	335160	The story was written by someone who has been designated the Daily Mail's science reporter.
335160	340380	But if we check Esper's paper, no surprise, it doesn't agree with the headline.
340380	345100	This is the reconstruction shown in the paper, with recent temperatures from northern Scandinavia
345100	346740	shown in red.
346740	351860	In the Mail's story and other blogs, the recent temperature data have been erased.
351860	356340	Airbrushing out recent temperature rises has become something of an art form among bloggers.
356820	361020	Here's a 2000 year reconstruction, as explained by meteorologist Art Horn.
361020	365020	Back in the medieval warm period it was as warm or warmer than today back in part of
365020	366020	the Roman Empire.
366020	369820	In the Roman warm period it was as warm or warmer than today.
369820	373020	Horn seems to draw this conclusion from the graph he shows.
373020	379860	I tracked it down to Craig Idso's website, CO2Science, where it was adapted from a 2010
379860	381980	paper by Lundqvist.
381980	387020	But how did Horn conclude that the reconstruction shows a warmer medieval warm period when the
387020	389500	author himself doesn't?
389500	393740	Lundqvist says the last two decades have been possibly hotter than at any time over the
393740	395500	last 2000 years.
395500	398020	Can't Lundqvist read his own graph?
398020	401660	No, it turns out this isn't Lundqvist's graph.
401660	403100	It's been doctored.
403100	405660	That's what adapted means in this case.
405660	409700	The high temperatures of the last few decades have been airbrushed out.
410580	413900	Here's the original as it appeared in Lundqvist's paper.
413900	418460	Here are two more 2000 year reconstructions doing the rounds of the blogosphere.
418460	422260	Several folks have tried to step back from the man hockey team approach and to use a
422260	425300	more fair selection of less controversial proxies.
425300	429860	Two such researchers are Moberg, who is generally considered a strong global warming supporter,
429860	432100	and Lowell, who is more of a sceptic.
432100	434580	And lo and behold, it comes right back to where we started.
434580	439100	We get the medieval warm period around 1000, we get a little ice age, and the temperature
439100	442460	today is similar or even lower than those in the Middle Ages.
442460	447220	Let's take the graph on the left first, which narrator Warren Meyer says comes from Moberg's
447220	449540	2005 study.
449540	452260	But of course it's been adapted.
452260	456820	If we look at Moberg's original, we can see that the instrumental temperature data showing
456820	460460	late 20th century warming has been erased.
460460	465220	Worse than that, Moberg's proxy data, that he says in the caption goes back as far as
465220	470820	1979, is extended to make it look as though it goes up to the year 2000.
470820	473220	The scale's been changed.
473220	477500	You can see that more clearly when I match the two graphs up.
477500	481740	Notice how the doctored graph ends short of the recent period of warming, but the date
481740	485060	has been changed to 2000.
485060	490220	So in the doctored graph, 30 years of warming is simply airbrushed out, and the scale moved
490220	494660	up to make it look as though it's a record that reaches to the present.
494660	499340	As for the second graph, it comes from a 2007 paper by Craig Lurell that's been widely
499340	501420	circulated on the net.
501420	506740	It seems to show proxy temperature data going up to the year 2000, and a medieval warm period
506740	509540	that's clearly warmer than the present.
509540	515660	But Lurell misunderstood the paleoclimatologist's convention of using 1950 as a benchmark to
515660	521060	denote the present, and wrongly calibrated the temperature data to 2000.
521060	525940	So his graph once again misses the recent decades of strong warming.
525940	531460	After this was pointed out, Lurell corrected the errors in a 2008 paper, producing a reconstruction
531460	534540	that this time ended in the correct date.
534540	539880	When recent temperature records are added, his reconstruction, shown in pink here, conforms
539880	543460	to others and shows the same familiar pattern.
543460	548940	Warming during the medieval period, then rapid warming at the end of the 20th century, culminating
548940	550420	in higher temperatures.
550420	554420	Finally, here's a graph that must be familiar.
554420	559540	If we look back further in time, before the Little Ice Age, we find a balmy golden era,
559540	564100	when temperatures were higher than they are today, a time known to climatologists as the
564100	565680	medieval warm period.
565680	569580	This graph shows the medieval warm period and the Little Ice Age.
569580	573940	But it's hard to create a panic about warming when temperatures today are below historical
573940	574940	levels.
574940	577820	About 800 years ago, they had the medieval warm period.
577820	581420	This is mainstream science, this is not me coming up with alternative stuff.
581420	585860	Believe it or not, this poster child for the medieval warm period comes from the arch nemesis
585860	588580	of climate science critics, the IPCC.
588580	592300	First, a few facts about this graph.
592300	596340	This isn't a quantitative reconstruction, it's a schematic.
596340	600980	There's no temperature scale on the y-axis, and most of the data seems to come from just
600980	602860	one location.
602860	607980	I say seems, because no one knows for sure where the data for this sketch comes from.
607980	613500	McIntyre concluded it probably came from a 1965 paper by Lamb, which was mostly based
613500	616420	on the temperature record of central England.
616420	620960	Phil Jones also concluded it must have come from Lamb, combined with an approximation
620960	626420	of temperatures in Western Europe based on historical and anecdotal evidence.
626420	631620	So whatever the author of this sketch might claim, this doesn't represent global temperatures,
631780	634300	because it's not based on global data.
634300	637700	Finally, the graph ends in 1950.
637700	642300	As Lowell discovered when he had to make his correction, that's what before present means
642300	647300	in paleoclimatology, as well as in geology and geography.
647300	653180	Under other circumstances, this kind of IPCC sloppiness would be labelled sketchgate, but
653180	658260	instead the schematic has been accepted as an unalterable truth, and become the basis
658260	661060	for a huge conspiracy theory.
661060	666420	Perhaps not understanding that science always moves forward as new evidence comes along,
666420	670860	the critics couldn't understand why the graph took on a completely different shape
670860	675020	in an updated IPCC report ten years later.
675020	680100	Their conclusion was that there must be a plot to abolish the medieval warm period.
680100	686060	Just eleven years later, in 2001, this graph appeared.
686060	687540	No medieval warm period.
687540	692300	A small cadre of climate researchers set out to eliminate the medieval warm period from
692300	693780	the historical record.
693780	697760	The supposed official view, which is that they've abolished the medieval warm period.
697760	702000	Of course, this conspiracy theory makes no sense in view of the huge amount of research
702000	707340	that's been done in unveiling the extent of the medieval warm period, but just to explain
707340	713140	to those who are still puzzled about why the shape of the graph changed, here it is again.
713140	718220	This was based mostly on a temperature record from just one location in central England.
718220	722500	This was based on data across the entire northern hemisphere.
722500	727860	This schematic ended in 1950, long before the recent period of warming began.
727860	733460	This reconstruction ended in the 1990s and included some of the recent warming.
733460	738900	This reconstruction is a schematic of unknown provenance with no temperature scale.
738900	743380	This was a first attempt at a quantitative reconstruction based on a limited number of
743380	747260	proxies with a very large margin of error.
747260	753540	And this reconstruction has itself been replaced by even more detailed and accurate reconstructions.
753540	758780	The thing is, all scientific understanding progresses from uncertainty towards certainty,
758780	761980	and is fraught with flaws and inaccuracies along the way.
761980	766820	Yes, all science, from an understanding of what our universe looks like, to the climatic
766820	770500	history of the earth, to the make-up of the atom.
770500	773300	As I showed in my video, the scientific method made easy.
773300	778060	If we take the most illustrative science, cartography, we can see very clearly how our
778060	784260	understanding of the shape of the North American continent changed over a period of 500 years.
784260	789720	Every single map is imperfect, and it's still imperfect, but at the same time our understanding
789720	792580	of the shape got better and better.
792580	796340	There's nothing wrong with this schematic, as long as you understand that it is just
796340	800640	a schematic, and it doesn't include the recent period of warming.
800640	805840	What you can't do is treat it as an unalterable truth about global temperatures, and pretend
805840	808900	that it includes the last 35 years of warming.
808900	813860	Which, of course, is exactly what a lot of people are doing.
813860	815700	And now we come to the last question.
815700	817800	What does all this mean anyway?
817800	822240	Why are the critics of climate science so determined to have a warmer medieval warm
822240	823240	period?
823240	824760	Well, let's ask them.
824760	828120	We cannot safely say that today's temperatures are exceptional.
828120	831120	So that there's nothing special about today's temperatures.
831120	835680	OK, but you don't need a congressional inquiry, an investigation by the National Academy of
835680	839200	Sciences and an internet squabble to tell you that.
839200	844180	A basic geology textbook could explain there's nothing special about today's temperatures.
844180	848700	The Earth has been much colder in the past, and much warmer in the past, and even the
848700	850780	same in the past.
850780	854180	Geologists have been researching and banging on about extreme climates in the past for
854180	856500	at least two centuries.
856500	861380	Never mind the medieval warm period, what about the Eocene Thermal Optimum, 55 million
861380	867000	years ago, when the Arctic Ocean was completely ice-free and subtropical?
867000	871140	If all you're looking for is evidence of hotter climates in the past, what about the Permian
871140	875700	Triassic, when global temperatures soared more than 14 degrees Fahrenheit warmer than
875700	876920	today?
876920	881300	So unless the climate critics are completely clueless about the climatic history of our
881300	886260	planet, surely they can't be struggling for examples of warmer climates in the past.
886260	887900	So let's try another reason.
887900	892220	We can say, because everybody agrees this, that it was nature that caused the medieval
892220	893220	climate warming.
893220	895840	There was virtually nobody who would try to maintain that we were having enough of an
895840	898460	influence on climate then to cause that warming.
898460	904300	Joanne Nova says, temperatures were higher 1,000 years ago and cooler 300 years ago.
904300	908260	We started warming long before cars and power stations were invented.
908260	911340	There's little correlation with CO2 levels.
911340	916660	But of course no one's suggested that the medieval warm period was caused by CO2 levels,
916660	921700	and as I've explained many times in my videos, carbon dioxide isn't the only factor that
921700	923700	drives global temperatures.
923700	926540	I'm surprised Joanne Nova doesn't know that.
926540	930980	She's got one of the most widely read climate blogs out there.
930980	934400	But then this has been explained so often to those who think climate science is all
934400	938380	about CO2 that I'm sure they understand it by now.
938380	943100	The feigned ignorance is probably because, well, if you can't use the old didn't have
943100	946980	SUVs in the Middle Ages argument, then what else is there?
946980	955300	What caused the temperature to be higher in the medieval warm period than it is now?
955300	958100	Could it have been turbocharged hand carts?
958100	962020	If critics want to use the medieval warm period to show there are causes of climate change
962020	967580	other than CO2, yet again climatologists have been explaining this for decades.
967580	972640	And yes, that fact can still be found in every basic geography textbook.
972640	977380	I've listed the main factors affecting climate in at least three of my videos, so this is
977380	982540	true whether the medieval warm period was warmer or cooler than today.
982540	987580	So if it wasn't carbon dioxide, what was the cause of the medieval warm period?
987580	992660	Well, climatologists think a combination of factors now looks likely, but the climate
992660	995460	science critics do have an explanation.
995460	1002260	So, if we assume that there were not enough 4x4s and SUVs driving around in the medieval
1002260	1007660	warm period, what natural causes might there have been for the climate fluctuations over
1007660	1012700	the past thousand years, which we now have really rather good grounds, I hope you'll
1012700	1016060	agree, for suspecting may actually have occurred?
1016060	1022580	Well now we'll go on and have a look at one possible guilty party, and that's the sun,
1022580	1025620	which is where, after all, the heat comes from.
1025620	1032820	It just so happens that during the medieval warm period, there was a period of increased
1032820	1034360	solar radiation.
1034360	1037300	It is the sun that does it, not man.
1037300	1042440	When sunspot activity is compared to temperature changes over the same period, a remarkable
1042440	1044160	correlation appears.
1044160	1048540	If that's the reason critics want to give for the medieval warm period, and some researchers
1048540	1053340	agree, then we can say with confidence that it can't be the reason for the rise in temperatures
1053340	1059260	we've seen over the last 35 years, because solar irradiation has been relatively stable
1059260	1064980	for the last 50 years and has even been in decline, so something else must be pushing
1064980	1066940	up temperatures.
1066940	1068720	And finally, there's this argument.
1068720	1074020	In the 13th century, we were probably 7 degrees Fahrenheit warmer than we are now, and it
1074020	1076500	was a very prosperous time for mankind.
1076500	1078000	The barmy golden era.
1078000	1081340	It was rather nice and big cathedrals were built all over Europe.
1081340	1086940	In fact, wherever you describe this warm period, it appears to be associated with witches.
1086940	1087940	With witches?
1087940	1089580	Are you sure?
1089580	1092340	Well where was it nice and associated with witches?
1092340	1095700	We have established colonies in southern Greenland.
1095700	1100500	Right in the 10th century, the Vikings settled in Greenland.
1100500	1105380	They found fertile fields and navigable waters teeming with codfish and seals.
1105380	1109140	OK, it was nice in Greenland, and the Vikings colonized it.
1109140	1110140	Where else?
1110140	1111140	We're having a heatwave.
1111140	1115060	In Europe, this was the great age of the cathedral builders.
1115060	1120540	Yes, we already know things were nice in Western Europe, vineyards in England, and so on.
1120540	1125380	Back then it was warmer, there was more trees, it was a very good farming land, very fast
1125420	1128140	Hang on, you're talking about Greenland again.
1128140	1132300	I want to know what the rest of the world was like during the medieval warm period.
1132300	1137180	It may be very nice for Greenlanders, but most people don't live in Greenland.
1137180	1142540	How come we're never given examples of barmy, wonderful riches anywhere else in the world?
1142540	1148040	Well the reason could be because not everywhere was like Western Europe.
1148040	1152100	One of the best known and best researched examples is North America, which certainly
1152100	1157500	seems to have warmed during the medieval warm period, but it also got a lot drier.
1157500	1162020	So dry that researchers are referring to conditions as a megadrought.
1162020	1166260	And as more research is done into the medieval warm period, coincident drought is turning
1166260	1170360	up in areas as far afield as China and Amazonia.
1170360	1174900	And this is exactly what computer modellers had predicted as the consequence of the current
1174900	1179640	increase in temperatures, an increasing drought spreading out from the southwestern United
1179640	1184080	States that will eventually encompass much of the grain belt.
1184080	1189060	And as in the medieval warm period, other parts of the world will also become drier.
1189060	1193880	But here's the good news that somewhat vindicates those who say the medieval warm period was
1193880	1197520	a golden barmy era full of riches.
1197520	1198640	Greenland's going to be lovely.
