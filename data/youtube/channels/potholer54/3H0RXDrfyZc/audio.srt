00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,360
One of the most difficult questions to understand about our origins is this. How can life come

2
00:00:10,360 --> 00:00:16,040
from non-life? Since every painting must have a painter, how can anything so well organized

3
00:00:16,040 --> 00:00:22,440
spontaneously arrive from an early earth that was so disorganized? Well, it's a good question.

4
00:00:22,440 --> 00:00:27,340
And let's start by asking why paintings can't paint themselves. Simple, because they're

5
00:00:27,340 --> 00:00:32,500
made of chemicals that can't replicate themselves. Same goes for watches or books or whatever

6
00:00:32,500 --> 00:00:37,840
other non-living object you care to mention. Animals and plants, however, are made of chemicals

7
00:00:37,840 --> 00:00:42,260
that can replicate themselves. There's no magic involved. It's just basic chemistry

8
00:00:42,260 --> 00:00:47,720
that's very well understood. So the real question is, how did these replicating chemicals come

9
00:00:47,720 --> 00:00:53,400
about? To answer that question, we need to go through a series of steps. If it's impossible

10
00:00:53,400 --> 00:00:59,480
for these chemicals to arise naturally, then let's see which of these steps is impossible.

11
00:00:59,480 --> 00:01:05,280
The first step involves looking at the primordial earth 3.7 billion years ago. There it is,

12
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:10,740
mostly wet, very warm, and with an atmosphere composed of all sorts of gases. Hydrogen,

13
00:01:10,740 --> 00:01:16,340
hydrogen cyanide, methane and ammonia are among them. DNA is a long chain molecule made

14
00:01:16,340 --> 00:01:21,720
from just four different types of nucleotide. So the first question is, where did the nucleotides

15
00:01:21,720 --> 00:01:28,160
come from? In 1961, a researcher called Juan Oro left hydrogen cyanide and ammonia to

16
00:01:28,160 --> 00:01:33,200
stew in an aqueous solution in his laboratory, under conditions very similar to those that

17
00:01:33,200 --> 00:01:38,240
prevailed on the primordial earth. Left alone, the solution produced adenine, one of the

18
00:01:38,240 --> 00:01:44,200
four nucleotide bases that make up DNA. To make a complete nucleotide, these bases need

19
00:01:44,200 --> 00:01:49,360
to gain a sugar called ribose and a group of phosphates. Biochemists think they know

20
00:01:49,360 --> 00:01:55,080
how the phosphate group formed. They're now trying to find out how the ribose is attached.

21
00:01:55,080 --> 00:02:01,200
Once nucleotides formed, the next step was to join together to make chains called polynucleotides.

22
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:05,640
In the 1980s, researchers found that a clay called montmorillonite, which was abundant

23
00:02:05,640 --> 00:02:11,100
on the primordial sea floor and in hot pools of water on land, is the perfect catalyst

24
00:02:11,100 --> 00:02:18,100
for this process. Some of these long polynucleotide chains, like ribonucleic acid or RNA, are

25
00:02:20,240 --> 00:02:25,880
able to make copies of themselves. The copies aren't always perfect, mistakes creep in,

26
00:02:25,880 --> 00:02:30,400
but some imperfectly copied molecules would have been better adapted to the environment

27
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:36,160
than others. These successful molecules continued to replicate and pass on their traits, while

28
00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:42,440
weaker or less well adapted molecules would have broken apart. As RNA molecules replicated

29
00:02:42,440 --> 00:02:47,000
themselves, they shared their environment with other chemicals that thrive in montmorillonite

30
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:53,080
clay. One group called lipids have a natural tendency to clump together to form spherical

31
00:02:53,080 --> 00:02:58,400
structures called micelles. RNA molecules that attracted these lipids would therefore

32
00:02:58,400 --> 00:03:03,900
find themselves protected inside a micelle membrane. Because they were better protected,

33
00:03:03,900 --> 00:03:10,560
they better survived and replicated more successfully. There you have the first primitive cells.

34
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:15,720
They look nothing like the complex cells we have today for a very good reason. Over 3.7

35
00:03:15,720 --> 00:03:21,440
billion years they have evolved. I'll tackle the subject of evolution in another video.

36
00:03:21,440 --> 00:03:26,360
Over hundreds of millions of years, RNA grew more complex. The single strand became a double

37
00:03:26,360 --> 00:03:32,480
strand and the better adapted DNA molecule evolved. One of the differences between RNA

38
00:03:32,480 --> 00:03:38,600
and DNA is that DNA needs proteins to replicate itself. Proteins are made of amino acids,

39
00:03:38,600 --> 00:03:42,800
which are often called the building blocks of life. So where did the first ones come

40
00:03:42,800 --> 00:03:48,960
from? A number of experiments using montmorillonite have produced not only amino acids but long

41
00:03:48,960 --> 00:03:54,840
chains of amino acids called polypeptides. Montmorillonite, it turns out, is a natural

42
00:03:54,840 --> 00:04:01,160
breeding ground for all kinds of complex organic chemicals. It has to be said that this research

43
00:04:01,160 --> 00:04:06,520
is in its infancy and current hypotheses are nowhere near as solid as the theory of evolution,

44
00:04:06,520 --> 00:04:11,600
which has been around for 150 years and has overwhelming evidence to support it. But the

45
00:04:11,600 --> 00:04:17,960
reality is a far cry from the idea that scientists believe life popped out of nowhere. Before I go,

46
00:04:17,960 --> 00:04:22,840
I just want to rebut a couple of hoary old myths that are often used to show that these steps must

47
00:04:22,840 --> 00:04:34,640
somehow be impossible. Really? But we know that's nonsense. Left alone, organic chemicals can and

48
00:04:34,640 --> 00:04:44,160
do polymerize to form longer, more complex chemicals. No, it doesn't. The natural origin

49
00:04:44,160 --> 00:04:48,960
of life doesn't violate any of the laws of thermodynamics. People who make that claim

50
00:04:48,960 --> 00:04:56,280
just need to read the laws of thermodynamics and they'd see why. That's true, but neither

51
00:04:56,280 --> 00:05:00,520
has lightning if we want to be strict about recreating things through natural conditions.

52
00:05:00,520 --> 00:05:06,080
For a long time, nuclear fusion couldn't be recreated in a laboratory, even though scientists

53
00:05:06,080 --> 00:05:11,480
knew exactly how it happened in nature. Recreating something in a laboratory has never been a

54
00:05:11,480 --> 00:05:17,280
prerequisite to understanding how it happens. Nature had millions of years and a laboratory

55
00:05:17,280 --> 00:05:21,320
the size of the earth to create just a few molecules that could replicate themselves.

56
00:05:21,320 --> 00:05:27,000
Given those odds, scientists aren't even trying to recreate life in a laboratory through natural

57
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:32,400
means. What they are trying to do is find out how these primordial chemicals work, what they're

58
00:05:32,400 --> 00:05:37,640
made of, how they interact, and what sort of processes are needed for their natural formation.

59
00:05:37,640 --> 00:05:43,080
Biochemists have made huge advances over the last few years and it's only a matter of time,

60
00:05:43,080 --> 00:05:49,440
perhaps easily within your lifetime, that all the steps that make up this process will be understood.
