0	10360	One of the most difficult questions to understand about our origins is this. How can life come
10360	16040	from non-life? Since every painting must have a painter, how can anything so well organized
16040	22440	spontaneously arrive from an early earth that was so disorganized? Well, it's a good question.
22440	27340	And let's start by asking why paintings can't paint themselves. Simple, because they're
27340	32500	made of chemicals that can't replicate themselves. Same goes for watches or books or whatever
32500	37840	other non-living object you care to mention. Animals and plants, however, are made of chemicals
37840	42260	that can replicate themselves. There's no magic involved. It's just basic chemistry
42260	47720	that's very well understood. So the real question is, how did these replicating chemicals come
47720	53400	about? To answer that question, we need to go through a series of steps. If it's impossible
53400	59480	for these chemicals to arise naturally, then let's see which of these steps is impossible.
59480	65280	The first step involves looking at the primordial earth 3.7 billion years ago. There it is,
65280	70740	mostly wet, very warm, and with an atmosphere composed of all sorts of gases. Hydrogen,
70740	76340	hydrogen cyanide, methane and ammonia are among them. DNA is a long chain molecule made
76340	81720	from just four different types of nucleotide. So the first question is, where did the nucleotides
81720	88160	come from? In 1961, a researcher called Juan Oro left hydrogen cyanide and ammonia to
88160	93200	stew in an aqueous solution in his laboratory, under conditions very similar to those that
93200	98240	prevailed on the primordial earth. Left alone, the solution produced adenine, one of the
98240	104200	four nucleotide bases that make up DNA. To make a complete nucleotide, these bases need
104200	109360	to gain a sugar called ribose and a group of phosphates. Biochemists think they know
109360	115080	how the phosphate group formed. They're now trying to find out how the ribose is attached.
115080	121200	Once nucleotides formed, the next step was to join together to make chains called polynucleotides.
121200	125640	In the 1980s, researchers found that a clay called montmorillonite, which was abundant
125640	131100	on the primordial sea floor and in hot pools of water on land, is the perfect catalyst
131100	138100	for this process. Some of these long polynucleotide chains, like ribonucleic acid or RNA, are
140240	145880	able to make copies of themselves. The copies aren't always perfect, mistakes creep in,
145880	150400	but some imperfectly copied molecules would have been better adapted to the environment
150400	156160	than others. These successful molecules continued to replicate and pass on their traits, while
156160	162440	weaker or less well adapted molecules would have broken apart. As RNA molecules replicated
162440	167000	themselves, they shared their environment with other chemicals that thrive in montmorillonite
167000	173080	clay. One group called lipids have a natural tendency to clump together to form spherical
173080	178400	structures called micelles. RNA molecules that attracted these lipids would therefore
178400	183900	find themselves protected inside a micelle membrane. Because they were better protected,
183900	190560	they better survived and replicated more successfully. There you have the first primitive cells.
190560	195720	They look nothing like the complex cells we have today for a very good reason. Over 3.7
195720	201440	billion years they have evolved. I'll tackle the subject of evolution in another video.
201440	206360	Over hundreds of millions of years, RNA grew more complex. The single strand became a double
206360	212480	strand and the better adapted DNA molecule evolved. One of the differences between RNA
212480	218600	and DNA is that DNA needs proteins to replicate itself. Proteins are made of amino acids,
218600	222800	which are often called the building blocks of life. So where did the first ones come
222800	228960	from? A number of experiments using montmorillonite have produced not only amino acids but long
228960	234840	chains of amino acids called polypeptides. Montmorillonite, it turns out, is a natural
234840	241160	breeding ground for all kinds of complex organic chemicals. It has to be said that this research
241160	246520	is in its infancy and current hypotheses are nowhere near as solid as the theory of evolution,
246520	251600	which has been around for 150 years and has overwhelming evidence to support it. But the
251600	257960	reality is a far cry from the idea that scientists believe life popped out of nowhere. Before I go,
257960	262840	I just want to rebut a couple of hoary old myths that are often used to show that these steps must
262840	274640	somehow be impossible. Really? But we know that's nonsense. Left alone, organic chemicals can and
274640	284160	do polymerize to form longer, more complex chemicals. No, it doesn't. The natural origin
284160	288960	of life doesn't violate any of the laws of thermodynamics. People who make that claim
288960	296280	just need to read the laws of thermodynamics and they'd see why. That's true, but neither
296280	300520	has lightning if we want to be strict about recreating things through natural conditions.
300520	306080	For a long time, nuclear fusion couldn't be recreated in a laboratory, even though scientists
306080	311480	knew exactly how it happened in nature. Recreating something in a laboratory has never been a
311480	317280	prerequisite to understanding how it happens. Nature had millions of years and a laboratory
317280	321320	the size of the earth to create just a few molecules that could replicate themselves.
321320	327000	Given those odds, scientists aren't even trying to recreate life in a laboratory through natural
327000	332400	means. What they are trying to do is find out how these primordial chemicals work, what they're
332400	337640	made of, how they interact, and what sort of processes are needed for their natural formation.
337640	343080	Biochemists have made huge advances over the last few years and it's only a matter of time,
343080	349440	perhaps easily within your lifetime, that all the steps that make up this process will be understood.
