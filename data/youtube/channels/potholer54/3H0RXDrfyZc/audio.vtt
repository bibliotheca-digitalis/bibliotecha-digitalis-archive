00:00.000 --> 00:10.360
One of the most difficult questions to understand about our origins is this. How can life come

00:10.360 --> 00:16.040
from non-life? Since every painting must have a painter, how can anything so well organized

00:16.040 --> 00:22.440
spontaneously arrive from an early earth that was so disorganized? Well, it's a good question.

00:22.440 --> 00:27.340
And let's start by asking why paintings can't paint themselves. Simple, because they're

00:27.340 --> 00:32.500
made of chemicals that can't replicate themselves. Same goes for watches or books or whatever

00:32.500 --> 00:37.840
other non-living object you care to mention. Animals and plants, however, are made of chemicals

00:37.840 --> 00:42.260
that can replicate themselves. There's no magic involved. It's just basic chemistry

00:42.260 --> 00:47.720
that's very well understood. So the real question is, how did these replicating chemicals come

00:47.720 --> 00:53.400
about? To answer that question, we need to go through a series of steps. If it's impossible

00:53.400 --> 00:59.480
for these chemicals to arise naturally, then let's see which of these steps is impossible.

00:59.480 --> 01:05.280
The first step involves looking at the primordial earth 3.7 billion years ago. There it is,

01:05.280 --> 01:10.740
mostly wet, very warm, and with an atmosphere composed of all sorts of gases. Hydrogen,

01:10.740 --> 01:16.340
hydrogen cyanide, methane and ammonia are among them. DNA is a long chain molecule made

01:16.340 --> 01:21.720
from just four different types of nucleotide. So the first question is, where did the nucleotides

01:21.720 --> 01:28.160
come from? In 1961, a researcher called Juan Oro left hydrogen cyanide and ammonia to

01:28.160 --> 01:33.200
stew in an aqueous solution in his laboratory, under conditions very similar to those that

01:33.200 --> 01:38.240
prevailed on the primordial earth. Left alone, the solution produced adenine, one of the

01:38.240 --> 01:44.200
four nucleotide bases that make up DNA. To make a complete nucleotide, these bases need

01:44.200 --> 01:49.360
to gain a sugar called ribose and a group of phosphates. Biochemists think they know

01:49.360 --> 01:55.080
how the phosphate group formed. They're now trying to find out how the ribose is attached.

01:55.080 --> 02:01.200
Once nucleotides formed, the next step was to join together to make chains called polynucleotides.

02:01.200 --> 02:05.640
In the 1980s, researchers found that a clay called montmorillonite, which was abundant

02:05.640 --> 02:11.100
on the primordial sea floor and in hot pools of water on land, is the perfect catalyst

02:11.100 --> 02:18.100
for this process. Some of these long polynucleotide chains, like ribonucleic acid or RNA, are

02:20.240 --> 02:25.880
able to make copies of themselves. The copies aren't always perfect, mistakes creep in,

02:25.880 --> 02:30.400
but some imperfectly copied molecules would have been better adapted to the environment

02:30.400 --> 02:36.160
than others. These successful molecules continued to replicate and pass on their traits, while

02:36.160 --> 02:42.440
weaker or less well adapted molecules would have broken apart. As RNA molecules replicated

02:42.440 --> 02:47.000
themselves, they shared their environment with other chemicals that thrive in montmorillonite

02:47.000 --> 02:53.080
clay. One group called lipids have a natural tendency to clump together to form spherical

02:53.080 --> 02:58.400
structures called micelles. RNA molecules that attracted these lipids would therefore

02:58.400 --> 03:03.900
find themselves protected inside a micelle membrane. Because they were better protected,

03:03.900 --> 03:10.560
they better survived and replicated more successfully. There you have the first primitive cells.

03:10.560 --> 03:15.720
They look nothing like the complex cells we have today for a very good reason. Over 3.7

03:15.720 --> 03:21.440
billion years they have evolved. I'll tackle the subject of evolution in another video.

03:21.440 --> 03:26.360
Over hundreds of millions of years, RNA grew more complex. The single strand became a double

03:26.360 --> 03:32.480
strand and the better adapted DNA molecule evolved. One of the differences between RNA

03:32.480 --> 03:38.600
and DNA is that DNA needs proteins to replicate itself. Proteins are made of amino acids,

03:38.600 --> 03:42.800
which are often called the building blocks of life. So where did the first ones come

03:42.800 --> 03:48.960
from? A number of experiments using montmorillonite have produced not only amino acids but long

03:48.960 --> 03:54.840
chains of amino acids called polypeptides. Montmorillonite, it turns out, is a natural

03:54.840 --> 04:01.160
breeding ground for all kinds of complex organic chemicals. It has to be said that this research

04:01.160 --> 04:06.520
is in its infancy and current hypotheses are nowhere near as solid as the theory of evolution,

04:06.520 --> 04:11.600
which has been around for 150 years and has overwhelming evidence to support it. But the

04:11.600 --> 04:17.960
reality is a far cry from the idea that scientists believe life popped out of nowhere. Before I go,

04:17.960 --> 04:22.840
I just want to rebut a couple of hoary old myths that are often used to show that these steps must

04:22.840 --> 04:34.640
somehow be impossible. Really? But we know that's nonsense. Left alone, organic chemicals can and

04:34.640 --> 04:44.160
do polymerize to form longer, more complex chemicals. No, it doesn't. The natural origin

04:44.160 --> 04:48.960
of life doesn't violate any of the laws of thermodynamics. People who make that claim

04:48.960 --> 04:56.280
just need to read the laws of thermodynamics and they'd see why. That's true, but neither

04:56.280 --> 05:00.520
has lightning if we want to be strict about recreating things through natural conditions.

05:00.520 --> 05:06.080
For a long time, nuclear fusion couldn't be recreated in a laboratory, even though scientists

05:06.080 --> 05:11.480
knew exactly how it happened in nature. Recreating something in a laboratory has never been a

05:11.480 --> 05:17.280
prerequisite to understanding how it happens. Nature had millions of years and a laboratory

05:17.280 --> 05:21.320
the size of the earth to create just a few molecules that could replicate themselves.

05:21.320 --> 05:27.000
Given those odds, scientists aren't even trying to recreate life in a laboratory through natural

05:27.000 --> 05:32.400
means. What they are trying to do is find out how these primordial chemicals work, what they're

05:32.400 --> 05:37.640
made of, how they interact, and what sort of processes are needed for their natural formation.

05:37.640 --> 05:43.080
Biochemists have made huge advances over the last few years and it's only a matter of time,

05:43.080 --> 05:49.440
perhaps easily within your lifetime, that all the steps that make up this process will be understood.
