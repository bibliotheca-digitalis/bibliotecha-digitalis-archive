0	2760	The only constant is change.
2760	6200	That's true about life and it's true about the climate.
6200	11640	This is Patrick Moore giving a presentation for something called Prager University about
11640	12640	climate change.
12640	18160	I don't know much about Prager University, but judging from its promo, I'm sure it's
18160	20760	a respectable academic institute.
20760	26000	It's called PragerU, a totally new concept in education.
26000	28960	It's simple and it works.
28960	33240	It has dignified professors who look as though they're speaking quite knowledgably about
33240	37480	weighty subjects, so I won't bother looking at it in any detail.
37480	41080	I'll move straight on to Patrick Moore's talk on climate change.
41080	43960	Sorry, what?
43960	45040	Run that by me again.
45040	49240	Or you have an obligation to me, God.
49240	50820	And what is that obligation?
50820	53160	That you live by the following nine commandments.
53160	55600	No, wait, I've changed my mind.
55840	59480	I do so want to take a quick look at Prager University.
59480	62400	Oh, please continue, professor.
62400	66080	The one thing God declares is that he took the children of Israel out of slavery and
66080	67440	into freedom.
67440	72840	That's how much God hates slavery and how important God considers freedom.
72840	77360	The founders of America based their entire view of America on this belief.
77360	78360	They did?
78360	82980	Now, there are some moments in time where I'm so sure that everyone's thinking exactly
82980	87280	the same thing that I'm thinking that to spell it out would be pointless.
87280	92140	There must be only six people watching this video who don't know what we're all thinking
92140	95740	and they're all graduates of Prager University.
95740	100740	So if you haven't already guessed, there's something you need to know about Prager University.
100740	103220	It's not a university.
103220	108940	Prager U is a political organisation founded by Dennis Prager, a Conservative talk radio
108940	109940	host.
109940	116500	He makes five-minute videos on everything from economics to science, sort of, to religion,
116500	121620	including old favourites like, I am the Lord, you're God, and if there's no God, murder
121620	123060	isn't wrong.
123060	126100	Patrick Moore, who you may remember from the weed killer incident...
126100	133020	Wait, no, we don't talk about the weed killer incident.
133020	137900	Anyway, Patrick Moore has done a number of videos for Prager U, including this one on
137900	139420	climate change.
139420	141580	Here again is his main argument.
141580	144040	Only constant is change.
144040	148000	That's true about life and it's true about the climate.
148000	153180	The climate is always changing, it always has, and it always will.
153180	157500	If this sounds familiar, it's because like nearly all of Moore's arguments, it comes
157500	158980	straight off the blogosphere.
158980	162880	Climate change is a natural phenomenon that there always will be.
162880	164780	The climate has always been changing.
164780	166940	There has never been a time when the climate has not changed.
166940	172420	But that's like claiming bacteria can't cause epidemics because there have always been epidemics,
172420	177820	or plate tectonics can't cause earthquakes because there have always been earthquakes.
177820	182900	How does the fact that the climate's always changed preclude carbon dioxide as being the
182900	185180	cause of that change?
185180	189980	Unwittingly by trying to show that CO2 and climate can't possibly be linked, Moore gives
189980	193180	us some good examples of that very link.
193180	198780	The evidence is actually against the hypothesis that we're causing the warming because there's
198780	204180	been warming and cooling cycles all through the history of life and some of them are longer
204180	208960	than others, like the last ice age before this one was 300 million years ago.
208960	214380	Indeed it was, and studies show that the cause of the last ice age, 300 million years ago,
214380	219580	was a drop in CO2 concentration as carbon dioxide was weathered out of the atmosphere
219580	225140	to form limestones, and absorbed and buried by forests to form coal.
225140	228660	Moore doesn't present any evidence that the studies are flawed.
228660	230320	He simply doesn't mention them.
230320	233620	And then it was warm for nearly 300 million years.
233620	238900	Yes, it became warm again when huge quantities of CO2 were pumped into the atmosphere by
238900	245540	two flood-basilled events called the Siberian Traps and the Central Atlantic Magmatic Province.
245540	250460	And since higher levels of carbon dioxide cause warming, the Earth got warmer.
250460	253700	It really isn't much of a paradox to people who study this.
253700	260260	It fits perfectly well with the role of CO2 as the main driver of long-term climate.
260260	265300	So Moore's simple observation that it got colder and then it got warmer is perfectly
265300	270500	compatible with the scientific conclusion that it got colder because CO2 levels fell
270500	273620	and it got warmer because CO2 levels rose.
274100	279020	He's got one more example, which I'm sure will also be compatible, but let's hear it anyway.
279020	281260	Before it was cold again, like it is now.
281260	287100	And as you can guess, the cooling trend coincided with a fall in CO2 concentration as carbon
287100	293340	dioxide was weathered out of the atmosphere and deposited as calcium carbonate in limestone.
293340	299260	So Moore can give as many examples as he likes of changing climate, but none of that is incompatible
299260	304700	with the conclusion of researchers that these changes were caused by carbon dioxide.
304700	309740	Interestingly, Moore doesn't even try to rebut the mountain of research that shows
309740	312780	CO2 is the cause of these changes in climate.
312780	315180	He doesn't even refer to it.
315180	318140	So we can cross that argument off the list.
318140	319900	Next we come to the weed killer incident.
323900	325500	Oh no, sorry, I forgot.
325500	328420	We must never mention the weed killer incident.
328460	332780	So next we come to Moore's claim that there are other reasons why the Earth might be warming.
332780	340780	There are many more factors in play than simply the concentration of CO2 in the atmosphere.
340780	345980	Factors such as the shape and size of the Earth's elliptical orbit around the Sun,
345980	353060	activity from the Sun, and the amount of wobble or tilt in the Earth's axis, among many others.
353060	355820	We'll come to fluctuations in the Sun in a minute.
355820	360460	But is Moore really saying that the warming we're experiencing is due to changes in
360460	362780	the Earth's tilt and orbit?
362780	366500	If he is, well that's a very easy claim to demolish.
366500	370660	The Earth's tilt and orbit are well understood and very predictable.
370660	377180	So predictable that they trigger glacial and interglacial periods with clockwork regularity.
377180	381580	Right now these factors are giving us a fairly benign climate and we're not expecting to
381580	388060	begin our descent into the next glaciation for another 16,000 to 20,000 years.
388060	393140	So no one can seriously claim that orbital shift is a factor in warming over the last
393140	398220	40 years, because that would require some sort of divine intervention, and astronomers
398220	401320	and geophysicists would have noticed.
401320	405100	So let's get back to Moore's other factor in climate change.
405100	406100	Activity from the Sun.
406100	409220	Yes, of course, the Sun's a factor in climate change.
409220	414440	But simply, when solar irradiance rises, it puts upward pressure on temperature.
414440	418660	When solar irradiance falls, it puts downward pressure on temperature.
418660	421660	Does anyone seriously disagree?
421660	427000	So since solar irradiance has been steady and then falling over the last 40 years, that
427000	431420	should have been putting downward pressure on global temperatures, right?
431420	433980	But global temperatures have been rising.
433980	435180	It's the Sun, stupid.
435180	437180	No, clearly it's not.
437180	441960	It's more accurate to say it can't possibly be the Sun, stupid, unless you think that
441960	445580	turning down a heater would cause a room to get warmer.
445580	448820	So something else is causing record warming.
448820	452300	Why does Moore think it can't possibly be carbon dioxide?
452300	458300	So then what about carbon dioxide, the great villain of the global warming alarmists?
458300	461140	Where does that fit into this picture?
461140	464340	Not as neatly as you might think.
464340	469380	Producers and carbon dioxide levels do not show a strong correlation.
469380	474880	In fact, over very long time spans, periods of hundreds of millions of years, they are
474880	477580	often completely out of sync with one another.
477580	482580	Here you have a complete reversal of the idea that CO2 causes warming, where they are in
482580	484340	exact opposites with each other.
484340	486940	And in fact, most of the time, they're pretty much out of sync.
486940	493460	And it shows very clearly that there's no lockstep correlation between CO2 and global
493460	494460	warming.
494460	498260	Anyone who's watched my videos will know that this one also comes from a blog by a
498260	501040	coal mining engineer, Monty Heeb.
501040	503700	Heeb simply stuck two graphs together.
503700	509180	One is a temperature sketch by Scottese in 1999, which Scottese derived from a book by
509180	512140	Frakes in 1992.
512140	519380	And Heeb got the CO2 data from a study called GeoCarb 3, published in 2001 by Berner et al.
519500	524580	Now let's be a teeny bit sceptical and check the sources of both graphs.
524580	529740	Frakes, the author of the temperature data, says the warming periods are due to relatively
529740	532100	high levels of CO2.
532100	535940	Conversely, cooler periods are due to lower levels of CO2.
535940	541200	Berner, writing eight years later, says that over the long term there's a correlation
541200	543060	between CO2 and temperature.
543060	547460	Let's leave aside the question of whether Moore actually read their studies.
547460	553100	The nub of the issue is why Moore concludes that there's no correlation when the authors
553100	558220	and every other researcher in this field says there is a correlation.
558220	561580	Just looking at these graphs would suggest that Moore is right.
561580	566580	So is there something the researchers know that Moore isn't telling us?
566580	568960	It turns out yes, there is.
568960	573460	Like all the bloggers he copied from, Moore completely omitted the warming effect of the
573460	575140	Sun.
575420	579020	Sorry if you've heard this before, but the Sun has been growing steadily hotter over
579020	583800	time, so there's no better a correlation between the Sun and global temperature over
583800	589500	the last 500 million years than there is between CO2 and global temperature.
589500	594340	But no one would be daft enough to conclude from this obvious lack of correlation that
594340	596620	the Sun has no effect on temperature.
596620	602280	It's a combination of solar forcing and carbon dioxide forcing that gives us a good
602280	605700	correlation with global temperature.
605700	610720	Correlation doesn't necessarily mean causation of course, but it is consistent with the overwhelming
610720	615820	body of evidence that CO2 is a major driver of climate.
615820	621160	And it completely demolishes Moore's claim that there's no correlation to begin with.
621160	626980	Ironically, Moore can only support this non-correlation claim by completely leaving out the effect
626980	632420	of the Sun, something that he's been so insistent on calling a big factor in climate
632420	634420	change.
634420	639300	If only Moore had recognised and included the growing output of the Sun in his model,
639300	643420	he would have been able to answer his own question about past climate very easily.
643420	648980	Here there was an ice age when CO2 was at least 10 times higher than it is today.
648980	653900	So why was there an ice age when CO2 was 10 times higher than today?
653940	659260	Because, as we've seen, the Sun was much, much weaker than today.
659260	661400	Why did we come out of that ice age?
661400	664140	Because CO2 levels rose.
664140	669000	The last internet myth Moore presents at public speaking events is the old one about climate
669000	674700	change stopped 15 or 18 or 19 or, in Moore's case, 20 years ago.
674700	681060	Contrary to media headlines, the trend over the past couple of decades has been essentially flat.
681060	682820	No, it hasn't.
682860	687100	All the temperature measurements show, and all the major climatological institutes in
687100	693780	the world agree, that temperatures have been rising for 40 years, including the last 20.
693780	699220	Simply repeating a shop-worn blogger's fear myth won't make it magically come true.
699220	704340	That's pretty much all of Patrick Moore's claims against carbon dioxide debunked.
704340	709540	If you thought, well, that was easy, yes it was, because, as I always say, you don't
709540	712500	need to be a genius to check facts.
712500	716580	Just have a bit of scepticism and the ability to look things up.
716580	720520	In Moore's case, it's even easier, because, since nearly all his claims are copied off
720520	724980	the internet, I've already debunked them in previous videos.
724980	729540	Moore is never exposed to criticism like this because he always plays to a friendly crowd.
729540	733100	It's my pleasure to introduce to you Dr Patrick Moore.
737740	742060	He's learnt from one bad experience that it's not a good idea to be interviewed by people
742100	744340	who might challenge his claims.
744340	750260	It was, I know, I shouldn't mention it, but, OK, it was the weed killer incident.
755260	762100	Maybe I'll, no I can't, oh right, you win, I'll tell you about the weed killer incident.
762100	764220	First you have to understand the background.
764220	768820	Patrick Moore doesn't actually do any scientific research or publish any scientific papers.
768820	771000	He makes a living as a PR consultant.
771040	776200	He founded a PR company 26 years ago called Green Spirit Enterprises, now called Green
776200	778400	Spirit Strategies Ltd.
778400	782180	And he's made a very good living over the last three decades, lobbying on behalf of
782180	787480	clients who get a bad rap from environmentalists, like fossil fuel companies.
787480	792200	And for me the bottom line is the fact that every square inch of the oil sands development
792200	793440	will eventually be reclaimed.
793440	797640	I'm going to talk about energy in general for a bit here, because the oil sands and
797640	801600	oil has to be contexted in the larger energy picture.
801600	803440	Pulp and paper companies.
803440	808120	We can make sure that the clearing of land is done legally and the cutting of trees is
808120	809120	done legally.
809120	814880	The giant paper company Boise Cascade is just as much in the business of planting trees
814880	817160	as it is in harvesting them.
817160	818480	Nuclear power companies.
818480	822920	They need to be put in a safe place and that's what Energy Solutions is doing.
822920	824660	They're doing a good job for all of us.
824700	830120	And of course he gets hired by political organisations to give speeches on climate change.
830120	835460	But sometimes Moore's enthusiasm for promoting junk science gets the better of him.
835460	840540	Like when he claimed that a weed killer called glyphosate is so safe that you can drink it.
840540	845940	I do not believe that glyphosate in Argentina is causing increases in cancer.
845940	849280	You can drink a whole quart of it and it won't hurt you.
849280	850280	You want to drink some?
850280	851280	We have some here.
851280	853120	I'd be happy to actually.
853120	854120	Not really.
854120	856120	I know it wouldn't hurt me.
856120	857120	If you say so.
857120	858120	I have some glyphosate.
858120	859120	No, no, I'm not stupid.
859120	860120	Ah, okay.
860120	861120	So you...
861120	862120	No, but I know that...
862120	863120	So it's dangerous, right?
863120	864120	I know...
864120	866120	No, people try to commit suicide but they fail fairly regularly.
866120	867120	Tell the truth.
867120	868120	It's dangerous.
868120	869120	It's not dangerous to humans.
869120	870120	No, it's not.
870120	871120	So are you ready to drink one glass of glyphosate?
871120	872640	No, I'm not an idiot.
872640	876600	Moore walked out of that interview and as far as I know he's never been questioned by
876600	879640	a sceptical interviewer since then.
879640	883720	The fact that Moore gets paid to make a lot of these claims doesn't matter.
883720	888580	I only mention it because Moore uses that argument himself, claiming that scientific
888580	893480	institutes like NASA reach their conclusions in exchange for funding.
893480	899120	And the scientists and science institutions who are bringing in billions of dollars for
899120	900120	this research...
900120	902560	What would be the motivation for NASA to do that?
902560	903560	If there's...
903560	907100	$1.8 billion in public funding.
907100	908360	That's the motivation.
908360	913200	But in fact, NASA's funding is being threatened because it continues to endorse the conclusion
913200	918360	that CO2 is affecting global temperature, a conclusion that runs counter to the beliefs
918360	922040	of politicians on the committee that sets NASA's budget.
922040	931120	The core function of NASA is to explore space and you know that I am concerned that NASA
931120	936800	in the current environment has lost its full focus on that core mission.
936800	942140	So ironically it's not NASA that gets paid according to its conclusions, but Moore.
942140	946200	The oil sands companies didn't pay him to conclude that burning fossil fuels is bad
946200	950940	for the environment, and if he tried to book himself as a speaker explaining the conclusions
950940	955700	of climate research, he'd very quickly find himself out of a job.
955700	960360	That's not what PragerU or the Heartland Institute want to hear.
960360	964660	But like I say, it's not important that Moore's making money by spreading this message.
964660	967380	He's welcome to make a buck any way he can.
967380	971560	What matters is that his claims are factually incorrect.
971560	977020	What matters is that he's chosen to omit, either through ignorance or by design, crucial
977020	982080	information that supports the peer-reviewed science rather than the blogs.
982080	985700	Let me end by saying there's one thing I do agree with Patrick Moore on.
985700	991200	When I started this series on climate change, I said I dislike the word denier, and I never
991200	992200	use it.
992200	995420	I'm glad to see that Patrick Moore agrees with me.
995420	1000960	It's mean-spirited because to call someone a climate change denier is to intentionally
1000960	1004120	link them to people who deny the Holocaust.
1004120	1005120	Well done, Patrick.
1005120	1009640	Nice to see that you're taking a principled stand and not counting the deniers of naturally
1009640	1011320	caused climate change.
1011320	1012320	D'oh!
1012320	1016360	Wait, before you go, if you want to support this channel, don't send money to me.
1016360	1019640	I'd only spend it on chocolate eclairs and Drambuie.
1019640	1022020	Send the money to a charity I support.
1022020	1024560	The donations link is in the video description.
1024560	1029100	You're just one click away from encouraging me to keep these videos coming, and you'll
