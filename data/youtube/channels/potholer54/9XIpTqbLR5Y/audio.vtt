00:00.000 --> 00:02.760
The only constant is change.

00:02.760 --> 00:06.200
That's true about life and it's true about the climate.

00:06.200 --> 00:11.640
This is Patrick Moore giving a presentation for something called Prager University about

00:11.640 --> 00:12.640
climate change.

00:12.640 --> 00:18.160
I don't know much about Prager University, but judging from its promo, I'm sure it's

00:18.160 --> 00:20.760
a respectable academic institute.

00:20.760 --> 00:26.000
It's called PragerU, a totally new concept in education.

00:26.000 --> 00:28.960
It's simple and it works.

00:28.960 --> 00:33.240
It has dignified professors who look as though they're speaking quite knowledgably about

00:33.240 --> 00:37.480
weighty subjects, so I won't bother looking at it in any detail.

00:37.480 --> 00:41.080
I'll move straight on to Patrick Moore's talk on climate change.

00:41.080 --> 00:43.960
Sorry, what?

00:43.960 --> 00:45.040
Run that by me again.

00:45.040 --> 00:49.240
Or you have an obligation to me, God.

00:49.240 --> 00:50.820
And what is that obligation?

00:50.820 --> 00:53.160
That you live by the following nine commandments.

00:53.160 --> 00:55.600
No, wait, I've changed my mind.

00:55.840 --> 00:59.480
I do so want to take a quick look at Prager University.

00:59.480 --> 01:02.400
Oh, please continue, professor.

01:02.400 --> 01:06.080
The one thing God declares is that he took the children of Israel out of slavery and

01:06.080 --> 01:07.440
into freedom.

01:07.440 --> 01:12.840
That's how much God hates slavery and how important God considers freedom.

01:12.840 --> 01:17.360
The founders of America based their entire view of America on this belief.

01:17.360 --> 01:18.360
They did?

01:18.360 --> 01:22.980
Now, there are some moments in time where I'm so sure that everyone's thinking exactly

01:22.980 --> 01:27.280
the same thing that I'm thinking that to spell it out would be pointless.

01:27.280 --> 01:32.140
There must be only six people watching this video who don't know what we're all thinking

01:32.140 --> 01:35.740
and they're all graduates of Prager University.

01:35.740 --> 01:40.740
So if you haven't already guessed, there's something you need to know about Prager University.

01:40.740 --> 01:43.220
It's not a university.

01:43.220 --> 01:48.940
Prager U is a political organisation founded by Dennis Prager, a Conservative talk radio

01:48.940 --> 01:49.940
host.

01:49.940 --> 01:56.500
He makes five-minute videos on everything from economics to science, sort of, to religion,

01:56.500 --> 02:01.620
including old favourites like, I am the Lord, you're God, and if there's no God, murder

02:01.620 --> 02:03.060
isn't wrong.

02:03.060 --> 02:06.100
Patrick Moore, who you may remember from the weed killer incident...

02:06.100 --> 02:13.020
Wait, no, we don't talk about the weed killer incident.

02:13.020 --> 02:17.900
Anyway, Patrick Moore has done a number of videos for Prager U, including this one on

02:17.900 --> 02:19.420
climate change.

02:19.420 --> 02:21.580
Here again is his main argument.

02:21.580 --> 02:24.040
Only constant is change.

02:24.040 --> 02:28.000
That's true about life and it's true about the climate.

02:28.000 --> 02:33.180
The climate is always changing, it always has, and it always will.

02:33.180 --> 02:37.500
If this sounds familiar, it's because like nearly all of Moore's arguments, it comes

02:37.500 --> 02:38.980
straight off the blogosphere.

02:38.980 --> 02:42.880
Climate change is a natural phenomenon that there always will be.

02:42.880 --> 02:44.780
The climate has always been changing.

02:44.780 --> 02:46.940
There has never been a time when the climate has not changed.

02:46.940 --> 02:52.420
But that's like claiming bacteria can't cause epidemics because there have always been epidemics,

02:52.420 --> 02:57.820
or plate tectonics can't cause earthquakes because there have always been earthquakes.

02:57.820 --> 03:02.900
How does the fact that the climate's always changed preclude carbon dioxide as being the

03:02.900 --> 03:05.180
cause of that change?

03:05.180 --> 03:09.980
Unwittingly by trying to show that CO2 and climate can't possibly be linked, Moore gives

03:09.980 --> 03:13.180
us some good examples of that very link.

03:13.180 --> 03:18.780
The evidence is actually against the hypothesis that we're causing the warming because there's

03:18.780 --> 03:24.180
been warming and cooling cycles all through the history of life and some of them are longer

03:24.180 --> 03:28.960
than others, like the last ice age before this one was 300 million years ago.

03:28.960 --> 03:34.380
Indeed it was, and studies show that the cause of the last ice age, 300 million years ago,

03:34.380 --> 03:39.580
was a drop in CO2 concentration as carbon dioxide was weathered out of the atmosphere

03:39.580 --> 03:45.140
to form limestones, and absorbed and buried by forests to form coal.

03:45.140 --> 03:48.660
Moore doesn't present any evidence that the studies are flawed.

03:48.660 --> 03:50.320
He simply doesn't mention them.

03:50.320 --> 03:53.620
And then it was warm for nearly 300 million years.

03:53.620 --> 03:58.900
Yes, it became warm again when huge quantities of CO2 were pumped into the atmosphere by

03:58.900 --> 04:05.540
two flood-basilled events called the Siberian Traps and the Central Atlantic Magmatic Province.

04:05.540 --> 04:10.460
And since higher levels of carbon dioxide cause warming, the Earth got warmer.

04:10.460 --> 04:13.700
It really isn't much of a paradox to people who study this.

04:13.700 --> 04:20.260
It fits perfectly well with the role of CO2 as the main driver of long-term climate.

04:20.260 --> 04:25.300
So Moore's simple observation that it got colder and then it got warmer is perfectly

04:25.300 --> 04:30.500
compatible with the scientific conclusion that it got colder because CO2 levels fell

04:30.500 --> 04:33.620
and it got warmer because CO2 levels rose.

04:34.100 --> 04:39.020
He's got one more example, which I'm sure will also be compatible, but let's hear it anyway.

04:39.020 --> 04:41.260
Before it was cold again, like it is now.

04:41.260 --> 04:47.100
And as you can guess, the cooling trend coincided with a fall in CO2 concentration as carbon

04:47.100 --> 04:53.340
dioxide was weathered out of the atmosphere and deposited as calcium carbonate in limestone.

04:53.340 --> 04:59.260
So Moore can give as many examples as he likes of changing climate, but none of that is incompatible

04:59.260 --> 05:04.700
with the conclusion of researchers that these changes were caused by carbon dioxide.

05:04.700 --> 05:09.740
Interestingly, Moore doesn't even try to rebut the mountain of research that shows

05:09.740 --> 05:12.780
CO2 is the cause of these changes in climate.

05:12.780 --> 05:15.180
He doesn't even refer to it.

05:15.180 --> 05:18.140
So we can cross that argument off the list.

05:18.140 --> 05:19.900
Next we come to the weed killer incident.

05:23.900 --> 05:25.500
Oh no, sorry, I forgot.

05:25.500 --> 05:28.420
We must never mention the weed killer incident.

05:28.460 --> 05:32.780
So next we come to Moore's claim that there are other reasons why the Earth might be warming.

05:32.780 --> 05:40.780
There are many more factors in play than simply the concentration of CO2 in the atmosphere.

05:40.780 --> 05:45.980
Factors such as the shape and size of the Earth's elliptical orbit around the Sun,

05:45.980 --> 05:53.060
activity from the Sun, and the amount of wobble or tilt in the Earth's axis, among many others.

05:53.060 --> 05:55.820
We'll come to fluctuations in the Sun in a minute.

05:55.820 --> 06:00.460
But is Moore really saying that the warming we're experiencing is due to changes in

06:00.460 --> 06:02.780
the Earth's tilt and orbit?

06:02.780 --> 06:06.500
If he is, well that's a very easy claim to demolish.

06:06.500 --> 06:10.660
The Earth's tilt and orbit are well understood and very predictable.

06:10.660 --> 06:17.180
So predictable that they trigger glacial and interglacial periods with clockwork regularity.

06:17.180 --> 06:21.580
Right now these factors are giving us a fairly benign climate and we're not expecting to

06:21.580 --> 06:28.060
begin our descent into the next glaciation for another 16,000 to 20,000 years.

06:28.060 --> 06:33.140
So no one can seriously claim that orbital shift is a factor in warming over the last

06:33.140 --> 06:38.220
40 years, because that would require some sort of divine intervention, and astronomers

06:38.220 --> 06:41.320
and geophysicists would have noticed.

06:41.320 --> 06:45.100
So let's get back to Moore's other factor in climate change.

06:45.100 --> 06:46.100
Activity from the Sun.

06:46.100 --> 06:49.220
Yes, of course, the Sun's a factor in climate change.

06:49.220 --> 06:54.440
But simply, when solar irradiance rises, it puts upward pressure on temperature.

06:54.440 --> 06:58.660
When solar irradiance falls, it puts downward pressure on temperature.

06:58.660 --> 07:01.660
Does anyone seriously disagree?

07:01.660 --> 07:07.000
So since solar irradiance has been steady and then falling over the last 40 years, that

07:07.000 --> 07:11.420
should have been putting downward pressure on global temperatures, right?

07:11.420 --> 07:13.980
But global temperatures have been rising.

07:13.980 --> 07:15.180
It's the Sun, stupid.

07:15.180 --> 07:17.180
No, clearly it's not.

07:17.180 --> 07:21.960
It's more accurate to say it can't possibly be the Sun, stupid, unless you think that

07:21.960 --> 07:25.580
turning down a heater would cause a room to get warmer.

07:25.580 --> 07:28.820
So something else is causing record warming.

07:28.820 --> 07:32.300
Why does Moore think it can't possibly be carbon dioxide?

07:32.300 --> 07:38.300
So then what about carbon dioxide, the great villain of the global warming alarmists?

07:38.300 --> 07:41.140
Where does that fit into this picture?

07:41.140 --> 07:44.340
Not as neatly as you might think.

07:44.340 --> 07:49.380
Producers and carbon dioxide levels do not show a strong correlation.

07:49.380 --> 07:54.880
In fact, over very long time spans, periods of hundreds of millions of years, they are

07:54.880 --> 07:57.580
often completely out of sync with one another.

07:57.580 --> 08:02.580
Here you have a complete reversal of the idea that CO2 causes warming, where they are in

08:02.580 --> 08:04.340
exact opposites with each other.

08:04.340 --> 08:06.940
And in fact, most of the time, they're pretty much out of sync.

08:06.940 --> 08:13.460
And it shows very clearly that there's no lockstep correlation between CO2 and global

08:13.460 --> 08:14.460
warming.

08:14.460 --> 08:18.260
Anyone who's watched my videos will know that this one also comes from a blog by a

08:18.260 --> 08:21.040
coal mining engineer, Monty Heeb.

08:21.040 --> 08:23.700
Heeb simply stuck two graphs together.

08:23.700 --> 08:29.180
One is a temperature sketch by Scottese in 1999, which Scottese derived from a book by

08:29.180 --> 08:32.140
Frakes in 1992.

08:32.140 --> 08:39.380
And Heeb got the CO2 data from a study called GeoCarb 3, published in 2001 by Berner et al.

08:39.500 --> 08:44.580
Now let's be a teeny bit sceptical and check the sources of both graphs.

08:44.580 --> 08:49.740
Frakes, the author of the temperature data, says the warming periods are due to relatively

08:49.740 --> 08:52.100
high levels of CO2.

08:52.100 --> 08:55.940
Conversely, cooler periods are due to lower levels of CO2.

08:55.940 --> 09:01.200
Berner, writing eight years later, says that over the long term there's a correlation

09:01.200 --> 09:03.060
between CO2 and temperature.

09:03.060 --> 09:07.460
Let's leave aside the question of whether Moore actually read their studies.

09:07.460 --> 09:13.100
The nub of the issue is why Moore concludes that there's no correlation when the authors

09:13.100 --> 09:18.220
and every other researcher in this field says there is a correlation.

09:18.220 --> 09:21.580
Just looking at these graphs would suggest that Moore is right.

09:21.580 --> 09:26.580
So is there something the researchers know that Moore isn't telling us?

09:26.580 --> 09:28.960
It turns out yes, there is.

09:28.960 --> 09:33.460
Like all the bloggers he copied from, Moore completely omitted the warming effect of the

09:33.460 --> 09:35.140
Sun.

09:35.420 --> 09:39.020
Sorry if you've heard this before, but the Sun has been growing steadily hotter over

09:39.020 --> 09:43.800
time, so there's no better a correlation between the Sun and global temperature over

09:43.800 --> 09:49.500
the last 500 million years than there is between CO2 and global temperature.

09:49.500 --> 09:54.340
But no one would be daft enough to conclude from this obvious lack of correlation that

09:54.340 --> 09:56.620
the Sun has no effect on temperature.

09:56.620 --> 10:02.280
It's a combination of solar forcing and carbon dioxide forcing that gives us a good

10:02.280 --> 10:05.700
correlation with global temperature.

10:05.700 --> 10:10.720
Correlation doesn't necessarily mean causation of course, but it is consistent with the overwhelming

10:10.720 --> 10:15.820
body of evidence that CO2 is a major driver of climate.

10:15.820 --> 10:21.160
And it completely demolishes Moore's claim that there's no correlation to begin with.

10:21.160 --> 10:26.980
Ironically, Moore can only support this non-correlation claim by completely leaving out the effect

10:26.980 --> 10:32.420
of the Sun, something that he's been so insistent on calling a big factor in climate

10:32.420 --> 10:34.420
change.

10:34.420 --> 10:39.300
If only Moore had recognised and included the growing output of the Sun in his model,

10:39.300 --> 10:43.420
he would have been able to answer his own question about past climate very easily.

10:43.420 --> 10:48.980
Here there was an ice age when CO2 was at least 10 times higher than it is today.

10:48.980 --> 10:53.900
So why was there an ice age when CO2 was 10 times higher than today?

10:53.940 --> 10:59.260
Because, as we've seen, the Sun was much, much weaker than today.

10:59.260 --> 11:01.400
Why did we come out of that ice age?

11:01.400 --> 11:04.140
Because CO2 levels rose.

11:04.140 --> 11:09.000
The last internet myth Moore presents at public speaking events is the old one about climate

11:09.000 --> 11:14.700
change stopped 15 or 18 or 19 or, in Moore's case, 20 years ago.

11:14.700 --> 11:21.060
Contrary to media headlines, the trend over the past couple of decades has been essentially flat.

11:21.060 --> 11:22.820
No, it hasn't.

11:22.860 --> 11:27.100
All the temperature measurements show, and all the major climatological institutes in

11:27.100 --> 11:33.780
the world agree, that temperatures have been rising for 40 years, including the last 20.

11:33.780 --> 11:39.220
Simply repeating a shop-worn blogger's fear myth won't make it magically come true.

11:39.220 --> 11:44.340
That's pretty much all of Patrick Moore's claims against carbon dioxide debunked.

11:44.340 --> 11:49.540
If you thought, well, that was easy, yes it was, because, as I always say, you don't

11:49.540 --> 11:52.500
need to be a genius to check facts.

11:52.500 --> 11:56.580
Just have a bit of scepticism and the ability to look things up.

11:56.580 --> 12:00.520
In Moore's case, it's even easier, because, since nearly all his claims are copied off

12:00.520 --> 12:04.980
the internet, I've already debunked them in previous videos.

12:04.980 --> 12:09.540
Moore is never exposed to criticism like this because he always plays to a friendly crowd.

12:09.540 --> 12:13.100
It's my pleasure to introduce to you Dr Patrick Moore.

12:17.740 --> 12:22.060
He's learnt from one bad experience that it's not a good idea to be interviewed by people

12:22.100 --> 12:24.340
who might challenge his claims.

12:24.340 --> 12:30.260
It was, I know, I shouldn't mention it, but, OK, it was the weed killer incident.

12:35.260 --> 12:42.100
Maybe I'll, no I can't, oh right, you win, I'll tell you about the weed killer incident.

12:42.100 --> 12:44.220
First you have to understand the background.

12:44.220 --> 12:48.820
Patrick Moore doesn't actually do any scientific research or publish any scientific papers.

12:48.820 --> 12:51.000
He makes a living as a PR consultant.

12:51.040 --> 12:56.200
He founded a PR company 26 years ago called Green Spirit Enterprises, now called Green

12:56.200 --> 12:58.400
Spirit Strategies Ltd.

12:58.400 --> 13:02.180
And he's made a very good living over the last three decades, lobbying on behalf of

13:02.180 --> 13:07.480
clients who get a bad rap from environmentalists, like fossil fuel companies.

13:07.480 --> 13:12.200
And for me the bottom line is the fact that every square inch of the oil sands development

13:12.200 --> 13:13.440
will eventually be reclaimed.

13:13.440 --> 13:17.640
I'm going to talk about energy in general for a bit here, because the oil sands and

13:17.640 --> 13:21.600
oil has to be contexted in the larger energy picture.

13:21.600 --> 13:23.440
Pulp and paper companies.

13:23.440 --> 13:28.120
We can make sure that the clearing of land is done legally and the cutting of trees is

13:28.120 --> 13:29.120
done legally.

13:29.120 --> 13:34.880
The giant paper company Boise Cascade is just as much in the business of planting trees

13:34.880 --> 13:37.160
as it is in harvesting them.

13:37.160 --> 13:38.480
Nuclear power companies.

13:38.480 --> 13:42.920
They need to be put in a safe place and that's what Energy Solutions is doing.

13:42.920 --> 13:44.660
They're doing a good job for all of us.

13:44.700 --> 13:50.120
And of course he gets hired by political organisations to give speeches on climate change.

13:50.120 --> 13:55.460
But sometimes Moore's enthusiasm for promoting junk science gets the better of him.

13:55.460 --> 14:00.540
Like when he claimed that a weed killer called glyphosate is so safe that you can drink it.

14:00.540 --> 14:05.940
I do not believe that glyphosate in Argentina is causing increases in cancer.

14:05.940 --> 14:09.280
You can drink a whole quart of it and it won't hurt you.

14:09.280 --> 14:10.280
You want to drink some?

14:10.280 --> 14:11.280
We have some here.

14:11.280 --> 14:13.120
I'd be happy to actually.

14:13.120 --> 14:14.120
Not really.

14:14.120 --> 14:16.120
I know it wouldn't hurt me.

14:16.120 --> 14:17.120
If you say so.

14:17.120 --> 14:18.120
I have some glyphosate.

14:18.120 --> 14:19.120
No, no, I'm not stupid.

14:19.120 --> 14:20.120
Ah, okay.

14:20.120 --> 14:21.120
So you...

14:21.120 --> 14:22.120
No, but I know that...

14:22.120 --> 14:23.120
So it's dangerous, right?

14:23.120 --> 14:24.120
I know...

14:24.120 --> 14:26.120
No, people try to commit suicide but they fail fairly regularly.

14:26.120 --> 14:27.120
Tell the truth.

14:27.120 --> 14:28.120
It's dangerous.

14:28.120 --> 14:29.120
It's not dangerous to humans.

14:29.120 --> 14:30.120
No, it's not.

14:30.120 --> 14:31.120
So are you ready to drink one glass of glyphosate?

14:31.120 --> 14:32.640
No, I'm not an idiot.

14:32.640 --> 14:36.600
Moore walked out of that interview and as far as I know he's never been questioned by

14:36.600 --> 14:39.640
a sceptical interviewer since then.

14:39.640 --> 14:43.720
The fact that Moore gets paid to make a lot of these claims doesn't matter.

14:43.720 --> 14:48.580
I only mention it because Moore uses that argument himself, claiming that scientific

14:48.580 --> 14:53.480
institutes like NASA reach their conclusions in exchange for funding.

14:53.480 --> 14:59.120
And the scientists and science institutions who are bringing in billions of dollars for

14:59.120 --> 15:00.120
this research...

15:00.120 --> 15:02.560
What would be the motivation for NASA to do that?

15:02.560 --> 15:03.560
If there's...

15:03.560 --> 15:07.100
$1.8 billion in public funding.

15:07.100 --> 15:08.360
That's the motivation.

15:08.360 --> 15:13.200
But in fact, NASA's funding is being threatened because it continues to endorse the conclusion

15:13.200 --> 15:18.360
that CO2 is affecting global temperature, a conclusion that runs counter to the beliefs

15:18.360 --> 15:22.040
of politicians on the committee that sets NASA's budget.

15:22.040 --> 15:31.120
The core function of NASA is to explore space and you know that I am concerned that NASA

15:31.120 --> 15:36.800
in the current environment has lost its full focus on that core mission.

15:36.800 --> 15:42.140
So ironically it's not NASA that gets paid according to its conclusions, but Moore.

15:42.140 --> 15:46.200
The oil sands companies didn't pay him to conclude that burning fossil fuels is bad

15:46.200 --> 15:50.940
for the environment, and if he tried to book himself as a speaker explaining the conclusions

15:50.940 --> 15:55.700
of climate research, he'd very quickly find himself out of a job.

15:55.700 --> 16:00.360
That's not what PragerU or the Heartland Institute want to hear.

16:00.360 --> 16:04.660
But like I say, it's not important that Moore's making money by spreading this message.

16:04.660 --> 16:07.380
He's welcome to make a buck any way he can.

16:07.380 --> 16:11.560
What matters is that his claims are factually incorrect.

16:11.560 --> 16:17.020
What matters is that he's chosen to omit, either through ignorance or by design, crucial

16:17.020 --> 16:22.080
information that supports the peer-reviewed science rather than the blogs.

16:22.080 --> 16:25.700
Let me end by saying there's one thing I do agree with Patrick Moore on.

16:25.700 --> 16:31.200
When I started this series on climate change, I said I dislike the word denier, and I never

16:31.200 --> 16:32.200
use it.

16:32.200 --> 16:35.420
I'm glad to see that Patrick Moore agrees with me.

16:35.420 --> 16:40.960
It's mean-spirited because to call someone a climate change denier is to intentionally

16:40.960 --> 16:44.120
link them to people who deny the Holocaust.

16:44.120 --> 16:45.120
Well done, Patrick.

16:45.120 --> 16:49.640
Nice to see that you're taking a principled stand and not counting the deniers of naturally

16:49.640 --> 16:51.320
caused climate change.

16:51.320 --> 16:52.320
D'oh!

16:52.320 --> 16:56.360
Wait, before you go, if you want to support this channel, don't send money to me.

16:56.360 --> 16:59.640
I'd only spend it on chocolate eclairs and Drambuie.

16:59.640 --> 17:02.020
Send the money to a charity I support.

17:02.020 --> 17:04.560
The donations link is in the video description.

17:04.560 --> 17:09.100
You're just one click away from encouraging me to keep these videos coming, and you'll

17:09.100 --> 17:13.340
be improving the health and welfare of people and forests at the same time.

17:13.340 --> 17:14.760
Tell them I sent you.

17:14.760 --> 17:19.700
So far, the charity has received over $10,000 from my subscribers.

17:19.700 --> 17:20.220
Many thanks.
