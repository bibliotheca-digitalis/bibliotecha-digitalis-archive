1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,240
On December 25th 2019, Dr Lu Xiaohong noticed a number of infections at his Wuhan hospital

2
00:00:07,240 --> 00:00:09,820
that weren't responding to treatment.

3
00:00:09,820 --> 00:00:13,980
It wasn't clear what was wrong with them, but tests quickly showed a coronavirus similar

4
00:00:13,980 --> 00:00:15,460
to SARS.

5
00:00:15,460 --> 00:00:21,100
Five days later, the director of the emergency department at Wuhan Central Hospital, Ai Fen,

6
00:00:21,100 --> 00:00:26,920
noted the words SARS coronavirus on a patient's report being referred to an ophthalmologist.

7
00:00:26,920 --> 00:00:32,320
At the same time, she alerted other doctors through the online forum WeChat.

8
00:00:32,320 --> 00:00:37,880
When the ophthalmologist Li Wenliang saw it that day, he also posted a message, this time

9
00:00:37,880 --> 00:00:40,740
on the social media site Weibo.

10
00:00:40,740 --> 00:00:45,980
Li became famous for being questioned by the Public Security Bureau a few days later and

11
00:00:45,980 --> 00:00:50,760
forced to sign a confession, admitting to disturbing the social order.

12
00:00:50,760 --> 00:00:52,360
But he wasn't the only one.

13
00:00:52,360 --> 00:00:57,920
Ai Fen and at least seven other whistleblowers were also officially admonished.

14
00:00:57,920 --> 00:01:03,200
On December 31st, five days after the virus had first been detected, China alerted the

15
00:01:03,200 --> 00:01:05,480
World Health Organisation.

16
00:01:05,480 --> 00:01:11,200
But the Chinese authorities played down the threat and their report was overly optimistic.

17
00:01:11,200 --> 00:01:15,600
They assured the WHO that the virus could be contained.

18
00:01:15,600 --> 00:01:18,280
So the public was kept in the dark.

19
00:01:18,280 --> 00:01:23,180
Even when the Wuhan seafood market was closed down the next day, the Chinese authorities

20
00:01:23,180 --> 00:01:28,840
again played down the threat, claiming the closure was just for renovation.

21
00:01:28,840 --> 00:01:34,700
In a land where the press is muzzled, there was no one to question them or investigate.

22
00:01:34,700 --> 00:01:39,840
It wasn't until January 9th that the Chinese government finally admitted to the severity

23
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:44,300
of the outbreak and shared the sequencing of the genetic code.

24
00:01:44,300 --> 00:01:46,960
The story became worldwide news.

25
00:01:46,960 --> 00:01:51,640
That same day, the WHO alerted governments around the world and told them this was a

26
00:01:51,640 --> 00:01:55,360
deadly new strain of coronavirus.

27
00:01:55,360 --> 00:01:57,640
The reaction of those governments was mixed.

28
00:01:57,640 --> 00:02:03,520
A balancing act between protecting civil liberties, economic health and public health are cultural

29
00:02:03,520 --> 00:02:06,720
and political issues that I don't cover on this channel.

30
00:02:06,720 --> 00:02:12,160
What does concern me is when governments don't understand or disregard scientific advice

31
00:02:12,160 --> 00:02:17,980
and even misrepresent scientific facts in order for good public relations.

32
00:02:17,980 --> 00:02:22,660
Because as the Chinese experience has shown, that has consequences.

33
00:02:22,660 --> 00:02:27,800
In Brazil, President Bolsonaro brushed the new virus off, likening it to the flu.

34
00:02:27,800 --> 00:02:31,840
And even several weeks after health experts in the United States were warning about the

35
00:02:31,840 --> 00:02:36,520
severity and fatality of the new virus, President Trump did the same.

36
00:02:36,520 --> 00:02:37,920
View this the same as the flu.

37
00:02:37,920 --> 00:02:43,120
When somebody sneezes, I mean, I try and bail out as much as possible with this sneezing.

38
00:02:43,120 --> 00:02:48,200
I mean, we've never closed the country before and we've had some pretty bad flus and we've

39
00:02:48,200 --> 00:02:50,100
had some pretty bad viruses.

40
00:02:50,100 --> 00:02:55,720
In fact, the new virus, officially called SARS-CoV-2, is very different to the flu.

41
00:02:55,720 --> 00:03:00,560
Firstly, it's far more contagious, which means you have to take much stronger measures than

42
00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:03,160
you would to protect yourself against flu.

43
00:03:03,160 --> 00:03:07,520
Secondly, the flu has been around for a long time, so people have built up a large degree

44
00:03:07,520 --> 00:03:09,440
of immunity to it.

45
00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:15,280
When the new virus broke out, no one had immunity to it, because by definition it is new.

46
00:03:15,280 --> 00:03:20,040
Thirdly, we have vaccines against the flu, which greatly reduces the number of people

47
00:03:20,040 --> 00:03:23,440
infected and the seriousness of the infection.

48
00:03:23,440 --> 00:03:26,920
There's no vaccine yet for the new coronavirus.

49
00:03:26,920 --> 00:03:30,200
And fourthly, the mortality rate is much higher.

50
00:03:30,200 --> 00:03:35,420
What kills you is not the virus itself, but the disease that comes from the virus.

51
00:03:35,420 --> 00:03:41,540
So while the official name of the new coronavirus is SARS-CoV-2, the disease it causes is called

52
00:03:41,540 --> 00:03:43,700
COVID-19.

53
00:03:43,700 --> 00:03:47,900
President Trump made the argument that far more people are killed every year by the flu

54
00:03:47,900 --> 00:03:50,700
than have been killed by COVID-19.

55
00:03:50,700 --> 00:03:53,980
So does that mean the flu is more deadly than COVID-19?

56
00:03:53,980 --> 00:03:56,460
No, of course not.

57
00:03:56,460 --> 00:04:00,540
Comparing the number of deaths from COVID-19 at the start of an epidemic after just one

58
00:04:00,540 --> 00:04:06,780
month, with the total annual number of deaths from flu, is not comparing like with like.

59
00:04:06,780 --> 00:04:09,620
That means it's not science and it's misleading.

60
00:04:09,620 --> 00:04:13,620
But I want to talk about the flu and the comparison to the coronavirus.

61
00:04:13,620 --> 00:04:16,700
The flu has a fatality ratio of about 0.1 per cent.

62
00:04:16,700 --> 00:04:17,700
Correct.

63
00:04:17,700 --> 00:04:18,700
And the flu is higher than that.

64
00:04:18,700 --> 00:04:20,260
The flu is much higher than that.

65
00:04:20,260 --> 00:04:21,340
No it isn't.

66
00:04:21,340 --> 00:04:27,340
The reporter, who happens to be a doctor and a medical correspondent, got the figure right.

67
00:04:27,340 --> 00:04:30,860
The doctor has a death rate of about 0.1 per cent.

68
00:04:30,860 --> 00:04:31,860
And COVID-19?

69
00:04:31,860 --> 00:04:37,740
Report today the global death rate at 3.4 per cent and a report that the Olympics could

70
00:04:37,740 --> 00:04:38,740
be delayed.

71
00:04:38,740 --> 00:04:39,740
Your reaction to that?

72
00:04:39,740 --> 00:04:46,500
Well, I think the 3.4 per cent is really a false number now and this is just my hunch.

73
00:04:46,500 --> 00:04:50,580
No, the figure is correct because it's simple maths.

74
00:04:50,580 --> 00:04:56,620
The number of deaths at the time of the study divided by the total number of reported cases.

75
00:04:56,620 --> 00:04:59,580
That's the number of people who've tested positive.

76
00:04:59,580 --> 00:05:04,580
It's known as the case fatality rate or, more colloquially, the death rate.

77
00:05:04,580 --> 00:05:07,220
This was explained when the figure was given.

78
00:05:07,220 --> 00:05:13,940
Globally, about 3.4 per cent of reported COVID-19 cases have died.

79
00:05:13,940 --> 00:05:16,940
So it depends on the number of people being tested.

80
00:05:16,940 --> 00:05:20,580
A lot of people aren't tested because they're asymptomatic.

81
00:05:20,580 --> 00:05:25,300
In other words, they develop very mild or no symptoms and may not even bother contacting

82
00:05:25,300 --> 00:05:26,600
a doctor.

83
00:05:26,600 --> 00:05:32,180
If everyone who actually contracted COVID-19 was tested and counted, the case fatality

84
00:05:32,180 --> 00:05:34,320
rate would be lower.

85
00:05:34,320 --> 00:05:37,300
Researchers estimate that's around 1 per cent.

86
00:05:37,300 --> 00:05:42,300
The death rate also depends on demographics because it's dramatically higher in older

87
00:05:42,300 --> 00:05:46,060
people and those with underlying health conditions.

88
00:05:46,060 --> 00:05:50,040
So the figure will vary from population to population.

89
00:05:50,040 --> 00:05:54,840
The President shouldn't be relying on hunches to guess at these crucial figures.

90
00:05:54,840 --> 00:06:00,080
He should be listening to experts who can explain what they are and what they mean.

91
00:06:00,080 --> 00:06:06,680
Like epidemiologist Dr Anthony Fauci who had no trouble explaining it to members of Congress.

92
00:06:06,680 --> 00:06:10,440
If you look at the cases that have come to the attention of the medical authorities in

93
00:06:10,440 --> 00:06:15,680
China and you just do the math, the math is about 2 per cent.

94
00:06:15,680 --> 00:06:21,720
If you look at certain age groups, certain risk groups, the fatality is much higher.

95
00:06:21,720 --> 00:06:30,380
But as a group, it's going to depend completely on what the factor of asymptomatic cases are.

96
00:06:30,380 --> 00:06:34,680
So if you have asymptomatic cases that are a lot, it's going to come down.

97
00:06:34,680 --> 00:06:41,880
What we're hearing right now on a recent call from the WHO this morning is that there aren't

98
00:06:41,880 --> 00:06:48,320
as many asymptomatic cases as we think, which made them elevate, I think, what their mortality

99
00:06:48,320 --> 00:06:49,780
is.

100
00:06:49,780 --> 00:06:56,680
You know, as well as anybody, that the mortality for seasonal flu is 0.1 per cent.

101
00:06:56,680 --> 00:07:02,700
So even if it goes down to 1 per cent, it's still 10 times more fatal.

102
00:07:02,700 --> 00:07:07,620
So if the President isn't taking the advice and accepting the figures of his own experts,

103
00:07:07,620 --> 00:07:11,980
where is he getting his flu comparisons and erroneous figures from?

104
00:07:11,980 --> 00:07:16,180
Well I'm no expert on his movements, but I do know he spends a lot of time watching Fox

105
00:07:16,180 --> 00:07:18,800
News where he would have heard this.

106
00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:22,680
In some years, tens of thousands of people die from the flu.

107
00:07:22,680 --> 00:07:24,620
Every year people die from the flu.

108
00:07:24,620 --> 00:07:27,500
It's a virus, like the flu.

109
00:07:27,500 --> 00:07:30,080
It actually can be mistaken for the flu.

110
00:07:30,080 --> 00:07:33,040
The President also came up with another suggestion.

111
00:07:33,040 --> 00:07:37,320
You know, a lot of people think that goes away in April with the heat, as the heat comes

112
00:07:37,320 --> 00:07:38,320
in.

113
00:07:38,320 --> 00:07:39,320
We're in great shape though.

114
00:07:39,320 --> 00:07:42,240
You know, in April, supposedly, it dies with the hotter weather.

115
00:07:42,240 --> 00:07:46,560
Looks like by April, you know, in theory, when it gets a little warmer, it miraculously

116
00:07:46,560 --> 00:07:47,560
goes away.

117
00:07:47,560 --> 00:07:48,560
Hope that's true.

118
00:07:48,560 --> 00:07:49,960
But what do you see as that?

119
00:07:49,960 --> 00:07:54,680
Trump certainly didn't get that from his scientific advisors or from any experts, because there's

120
00:07:54,680 --> 00:07:56,920
no evidence for it at all.

121
00:07:56,920 --> 00:08:02,640
Now COVID-19 may start to subside in the spring and summer, but that'll be because all viruses

122
00:08:02,640 --> 00:08:04,680
follow a bell curve.

123
00:08:04,680 --> 00:08:09,300
But as thousands of cases in South East Asia and other tropical areas show, hot weather

124
00:08:09,300 --> 00:08:12,060
is no impediment to this virus.

125
00:08:12,060 --> 00:08:14,240
So where does the myth come from?

126
00:08:14,240 --> 00:08:17,760
Of course, it's our old friend the internet.

127
00:08:17,760 --> 00:08:21,980
This list, for example, has been passed around Facebook and Twitter from someone who claims

128
00:08:21,980 --> 00:08:25,920
to have heard from someone whose uncle is a doctor in Shenzhen.

129
00:08:25,920 --> 00:08:30,680
The poster said the man said his uncle said that the virus is killed by temperatures above

130
00:08:30,680 --> 00:08:33,760
26 or 27 degrees.

131
00:08:33,760 --> 00:08:37,880
If you're stupid enough to believe unsoiled crap on Twitter, I guess you're not smart

132
00:08:37,880 --> 00:08:42,840
enough to wonder why the virus would then be able to thrive in normal body temperatures

133
00:08:42,840 --> 00:08:44,940
of 37 degrees.

134
00:08:44,940 --> 00:08:50,140
The BBC tracked down the person they say started the list, an 84-year-old man called Peter.

135
00:08:50,140 --> 00:08:55,220
Everything I posted, I believed genuinely to be the truth and factual.

136
00:08:55,220 --> 00:08:59,220
Oh, as long as you genuinely believed it, that's fine then.

137
00:08:59,220 --> 00:09:01,700
Look, here's a better idea, Pete.

138
00:09:01,700 --> 00:09:04,900
Stop spreading this junk science in the first place.

139
00:09:04,900 --> 00:09:09,640
Because this is the kind of stuff President Trump sees, and before you know it, it overrides

140
00:09:09,640 --> 00:09:12,800
the advice of his own scientific experts.

141
00:09:12,800 --> 00:09:16,520
The frustrating thing is that the President doesn't need to get his information from the

142
00:09:16,520 --> 00:09:18,520
internet or Fox News.

143
00:09:18,520 --> 00:09:24,440
He has an infectious diseases expert standing right next to him at nearly every news conference.

144
00:09:24,440 --> 00:09:25,960
One of many.

145
00:09:25,960 --> 00:09:30,320
But for reasons I'll let you figure out, they can't tell the President directly.

146
00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:34,780
They have to correct him in more subtle ways, like explaining the facts to someone else

147
00:09:34,780 --> 00:09:37,200
while the President is listening.

148
00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:39,840
But I don't have to tread on eggshells.

149
00:09:39,840 --> 00:09:44,080
Thanks to freedom of speech, I can say no, especially to a President who's publicly giving

150
00:09:44,080 --> 00:09:49,640
out misleading and overly optimistic information in the middle of a health crisis.

151
00:09:49,640 --> 00:09:59,760
A drug called chloroquine, and some people would add to it, hydroxychloroquine.

152
00:09:59,760 --> 00:10:06,220
No, they call hydroxychloroquine hydroxychloroquine because it's a different chemical and a different

153
00:10:06,220 --> 00:10:07,220
drug.

154
00:10:07,220 --> 00:10:11,220
It's toxic derivative of chloroquine and is used to treat different ailments.

155
00:10:11,220 --> 00:10:17,780
But the nice part is it's been around for a long time, so we know that if things don't

156
00:10:17,780 --> 00:10:22,980
go as planned, it's not going to kill anybody.

157
00:10:22,980 --> 00:10:25,460
No, we don't know that at all.

158
00:10:25,460 --> 00:10:28,740
That's why medical researchers have to do clinical trials.

159
00:10:28,740 --> 00:10:33,660
Both of these drugs have side effects, sometimes dangerous side effects for people with certain

160
00:10:33,660 --> 00:10:35,540
medical conditions.

161
00:10:35,540 --> 00:10:39,380
And although anecdotal evidence suggests that they don't have any adverse effects

162
00:10:39,380 --> 00:10:45,460
in Covid-19 patients, a proper trial is needed to ensure that if you give the drug to thousands

163
00:10:45,460 --> 00:10:49,480
of people struggling to breathe, it won't end up killing them.

164
00:10:49,480 --> 00:10:55,100
And it's shown very encouraging, very, very encouraging early results.

165
00:10:55,100 --> 00:10:57,800
But this is just anecdotal evidence.

166
00:10:57,800 --> 00:11:01,640
Doctors need to know what the side effects are, how much will be effective and over what

167
00:11:01,640 --> 00:11:03,700
period of time.

168
00:11:03,700 --> 00:11:09,980
And we're going to be able to make that drug available almost immediately.

169
00:11:09,980 --> 00:11:11,720
No, you won't.

170
00:11:11,720 --> 00:11:16,020
At the time of the press conference, it's only available to urgent cases and people

171
00:11:16,020 --> 00:11:18,540
involved in clinical trials.

172
00:11:18,540 --> 00:11:23,960
Most patients with Covid-19 won't have access to it until the clinical trials are over and

173
00:11:23,960 --> 00:11:26,460
it's been approved to treat Covid-19.

174
00:11:26,460 --> 00:11:30,060
And that's where the FDA has been so great.

175
00:11:30,060 --> 00:11:31,800
They've gone through the approval process.

176
00:11:31,800 --> 00:11:32,800
It's been approved.

177
00:11:32,900 --> 00:11:34,680
No, they haven't.

178
00:11:34,680 --> 00:11:39,240
Chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine have only been approved for their specified uses.

179
00:11:39,240 --> 00:11:42,640
They haven't yet been approved for the treatment of Covid-19.

180
00:11:42,640 --> 00:11:43,640
And they did it.

181
00:11:43,640 --> 00:11:48,720
They took it down from many, many months to immediate.

182
00:11:48,720 --> 00:11:52,320
So we're going to be able to make that drug available by prescription.

183
00:11:52,320 --> 00:11:57,680
Again, only for urgent cases and people involved in the clinical trials.

184
00:11:57,680 --> 00:12:02,960
It's fine to give people hope and to be optimistic, but not to mislead them.

185
00:12:02,960 --> 00:12:07,880
These drugs may indeed prove to be effective, but we have to wait and see.

186
00:12:07,880 --> 00:12:13,480
In the meantime, saying a cure is already here can lead to complacency and even dangerous

187
00:12:13,480 --> 00:12:15,720
self-medication.

188
00:12:15,720 --> 00:12:20,280
The experts can't contradict the president as bluntly as I have, so another trick they

189
00:12:20,280 --> 00:12:25,280
use is to change what the president said to something that is correct and then pretend

190
00:12:25,280 --> 00:12:26,920
the president had said it.

191
00:12:26,920 --> 00:12:31,480
Many Americans have read studies and heard media reports about this drug chloroquine,

192
00:12:31,480 --> 00:12:33,440
which is an anti-malarial drug.

193
00:12:33,440 --> 00:12:38,240
It's already approved, as the president said, for the treatment of malaria, as well as an

194
00:12:38,240 --> 00:12:40,320
arthritis condition evidence.

195
00:12:40,320 --> 00:12:45,140
So as the commissioner of FDA and the president mentioned yesterday, we're trying to strike

196
00:12:45,140 --> 00:12:52,220
a balance between making something with a potential of an effect to the American people

197
00:12:52,220 --> 00:12:56,800
available at the same time that we do it under the auspices of a protocol that would give

198
00:12:56,800 --> 00:13:02,200
us information to determine if it's truly safe and truly effective.

199
00:13:02,200 --> 00:13:06,200
What the president was saying is that we're going to look at all of these drugs and we're

200
00:13:06,200 --> 00:13:12,240
going to try to get them available in the context of some sort of a protocol where you

201
00:13:12,240 --> 00:13:15,380
just don't distribute drugs willy-nilly.

202
00:13:15,380 --> 00:13:20,520
You may make it more accessible than you would have previously, but you do it in the context

203
00:13:20,520 --> 00:13:25,680
to at least get some feel for both safety and whether it works.

204
00:13:25,680 --> 00:13:31,140
That was the message about the malaria drug hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine.

205
00:13:31,140 --> 00:13:35,720
In a candid interview with the journal Science, Fauci admitted that he had to walk a fine

206
00:13:35,720 --> 00:13:36,720
line.

207
00:13:36,720 --> 00:13:38,500
The question was put to him.

208
00:13:38,500 --> 00:13:42,600
Trump keeps saying that the travel ban for China, which began 2nd February, had a big

209
00:13:42,600 --> 00:13:47,020
impact on slowing the spread of the virus to the United States and that he wishes China

210
00:13:47,020 --> 00:13:51,520
would have told us three to four months earlier and that they were very secretive.

211
00:13:51,520 --> 00:13:53,760
It just doesn't comport with facts.

212
00:13:53,760 --> 00:13:56,720
Fauci said, I know, but what do you want me to do?

213
00:13:56,720 --> 00:13:59,520
I mean, seriously, John, let's get real.

214
00:13:59,520 --> 00:14:01,280
What do you want me to do?

215
00:14:01,280 --> 00:14:05,740
And then the question, you're standing there as the representative of truth and facts and

216
00:14:05,740 --> 00:14:09,360
things are being said that aren't true and aren't factual.

217
00:14:09,360 --> 00:14:14,520
Fauci said, the way it happened is that after he made that statement, suggesting China could

218
00:14:14,520 --> 00:14:19,680
have revealed the discovery of a new coronavirus three to four months earlier, I told the appropriate

219
00:14:19,680 --> 00:14:25,380
people it doesn't comport because two to three months earlier would have been September.

220
00:14:25,380 --> 00:14:29,560
The next time they sit down with him and talk about what he's going to say, they'll say,

221
00:14:29,560 --> 00:14:33,800
by the way, Mr President, be careful about this and don't say that.

222
00:14:33,800 --> 00:14:36,960
But I can't jump in front of a microphone and push him down.

223
00:14:36,960 --> 00:14:41,960
OK, he said it, let's try and get it corrected for the next time.

224
00:14:41,960 --> 00:14:43,980
The three months referred to this comment.

225
00:14:43,980 --> 00:14:46,680
Our relationship with China is a very good relationship.

226
00:14:46,680 --> 00:14:51,080
I wish they told us three months sooner that this was a problem.

227
00:14:51,080 --> 00:14:53,460
We didn't know about it.

228
00:14:53,460 --> 00:14:56,840
They knew about it and they should have told us we could have saved a lot of lives throughout

229
00:14:56,840 --> 00:14:57,840
the world.

230
00:14:57,840 --> 00:15:01,760
But the United States did know about it as early as January the 9th.

231
00:15:01,760 --> 00:15:04,260
The WHO put out a worldwide alert.

232
00:15:04,260 --> 00:15:07,440
It was even reported in the American media.

233
00:15:07,440 --> 00:15:12,320
Six days later, a passenger flight from Wuhan brought the virus to the United States and

234
00:15:12,320 --> 00:15:15,400
was diagnosed on January the 20th.

235
00:15:15,400 --> 00:15:19,880
By January 22nd, the virus had spread to 10 other countries and thousands of people

236
00:15:19,880 --> 00:15:21,600
were infected.

237
00:15:21,600 --> 00:15:25,360
And this was the president's reaction that day in Davos.

238
00:15:25,360 --> 00:15:26,760
Have you been briefed by the CDC?

239
00:15:26,760 --> 00:15:27,760
They have.

240
00:15:27,760 --> 00:15:29,360
Are there words about a pandemic at this point?

241
00:15:29,360 --> 00:15:33,040
No, we're not at all and we have it totally under control.

242
00:15:33,040 --> 00:15:37,980
It's one person coming in from China and we have it under control.

243
00:15:37,980 --> 00:15:39,840
It's going to be just fine.

244
00:15:39,840 --> 00:15:44,480
And it wasn't until a week later and three weeks after the US had been notified about

245
00:15:44,480 --> 00:15:49,400
the severity of the virus that the Trump administration set up a task force to monitor

246
00:15:49,400 --> 00:15:50,400
it.

247
00:15:50,400 --> 00:15:55,760
Two days later, it finally ordered the quarantining of visitors from the infected countries.

248
00:15:55,760 --> 00:15:57,660
By then, it was too late.

249
00:15:57,660 --> 00:16:04,200
The virus was already present inside the USA and spreading and not enough testing was being

250
00:16:04,200 --> 00:16:06,360
done to contain it.

251
00:16:06,360 --> 00:16:10,760
A month later, more than seven weeks after the US government had been alerted to the

252
00:16:10,760 --> 00:16:15,600
severity of the new virus, hospitals and labs were finally allowed to conduct their

253
00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:18,320
own COVID-19 tests.

254
00:16:18,320 --> 00:16:23,260
In the meantime, attempts to minimise the outbreak continued, completely contrary to

255
00:16:23,260 --> 00:16:26,560
the science and to the medical advice being given.

256
00:16:26,560 --> 00:16:27,880
We have it totally under control.

257
00:16:27,880 --> 00:16:29,240
It's one person.

258
00:16:29,240 --> 00:16:31,120
We think we have it very well under control.

259
00:16:31,120 --> 00:16:34,280
We pretty much shut it down coming in from China.

260
00:16:34,280 --> 00:16:37,280
And I think the numbers are going to get progressively better as we go along.

261
00:16:37,280 --> 00:16:40,040
We have it very much under control in this country.

262
00:16:40,040 --> 00:16:41,040
People are getting better.

263
00:16:41,040 --> 00:16:42,040
They're all getting better.

264
00:16:42,040 --> 00:16:48,360
The coronavirus, which is very well under control in our country.

265
00:16:48,360 --> 00:16:52,240
And the 15 within a couple of days is going to be down to close to zero.

266
00:16:52,240 --> 00:16:57,440
Because of all we've done, the risk to the American people remains very low.

267
00:16:57,440 --> 00:17:00,120
The coronavirus, you know that, right?

268
00:17:00,120 --> 00:17:01,120
Coronavirus.

269
00:17:01,120 --> 00:17:03,200
And this is their new hoax.

270
00:17:03,200 --> 00:17:05,920
We're talking about very small numbers in the United States.

271
00:17:05,920 --> 00:17:08,580
Our numbers are lower than just about anybody.

272
00:17:08,580 --> 00:17:12,860
Saying we have it under control and have stopped it several weeks after the first case

273
00:17:12,860 --> 00:17:18,920
was detected and while infection rates were rapidly rising is exactly what China was criticised

274
00:17:18,920 --> 00:17:22,480
for during the two weeks of its rosy denials.

275
00:17:22,480 --> 00:17:27,740
But when image and public relations confront reality, it's reality that will eventually

276
00:17:27,740 --> 00:17:28,740
win.

277
00:17:28,740 --> 00:17:33,820
I've always known this is a, this is a real, this is a pandemic.

278
00:17:33,820 --> 00:17:38,560
But there are worrying signs that the president still only wants to hear good news and even

279
00:17:38,560 --> 00:17:41,840
criticise the media for reporting bad news.

280
00:17:41,840 --> 00:17:45,600
One of his first actions after appointing Mike Pence's response team at the end of

281
00:17:45,600 --> 00:17:48,440
February was to muzzle health officials.

282
00:17:48,440 --> 00:17:53,000
Dr Fauci was told he had to get clearance through the vice president's office before

283
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:54,840
talking to the media.

284
00:17:54,840 --> 00:17:59,200
I don't really care if I get in trouble for speaking to the media.

285
00:17:59,200 --> 00:18:04,920
I want people to know that this is bad.

286
00:18:04,920 --> 00:18:06,400
People are dying.

287
00:18:06,400 --> 00:18:11,160
We don't have the tools that we need in the emergency department and in the hospital to

288
00:18:11,160 --> 00:18:19,880
take care of them and, and it's really hard.

289
00:18:19,880 --> 00:18:24,000
The frustrating thing about all of this is it really just feels like it's too little,

290
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:25,000
too late.

291
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:28,720
Like we knew, we knew it was coming.

292
00:18:28,720 --> 00:18:32,200
What do you say to Americans who are watching you right now who are scared?

293
00:18:32,200 --> 00:18:34,200
I say that you're a terrible reporter.

294
00:18:34,200 --> 00:18:35,200
That's what I say.

295
00:18:35,200 --> 00:18:40,600
I think it's a very nasty question and I think it's a very bad signal that you're putting

296
00:18:40,600 --> 00:18:42,240
out to the American people.

297
00:18:42,240 --> 00:18:46,340
The American people are looking for answers and they're looking for hope.

298
00:18:46,340 --> 00:18:48,120
That's really bad reporting.

299
00:18:48,120 --> 00:18:53,240
No, the answer to that very sensible question should be, I want to reassure Americans who

300
00:18:53,240 --> 00:18:55,880
are scared that we'll get through this.

301
00:18:55,880 --> 00:18:59,120
You don't need to be scared, but you do need to be cautious.

302
00:18:59,120 --> 00:19:01,040
Follow the medical advice.

303
00:19:01,040 --> 00:19:06,200
If we do those things together as a nation, we'll get through this more safely and more

304
00:19:06,200 --> 00:19:07,200
quickly.

305
00:19:07,200 --> 00:19:11,800
In other words, you give people hope by being honest with them, not painting a false picture

306
00:19:11,800 --> 00:19:16,660
of the science and then blaming the press for not doing the same.

307
00:19:16,660 --> 00:19:21,240
Because science is about reality, it deals with the way things really are, not the way

308
00:19:21,240 --> 00:19:26,040
we wish they were or hope they'll be or think they ought to be.

309
00:19:26,040 --> 00:19:30,440
Reality doesn't change depending on your nationality or your religious, political or

310
00:19:30,440 --> 00:19:33,300
ideological position.

311
00:19:33,300 --> 00:19:37,320
When people are forced to choose between believing a politician they like and a scientist they

312
00:19:37,320 --> 00:19:42,320
don't know, they'll often go with the politician and reject the science.

313
00:19:42,320 --> 00:19:47,400
That's why only 40% of Republicans who trusted the President thought the worst was yet to

314
00:19:47,400 --> 00:19:51,240
come as opposed to 80% of Democrats.

315
00:19:51,240 --> 00:19:53,080
And here's the problem with that.

316
00:19:53,080 --> 00:19:57,320
When people believe their President's claim that the virus is no worse than the flu and

317
00:19:57,320 --> 00:20:02,320
it's already been stopped, and they see him shaking hands and holding rallies, they become

318
00:20:02,320 --> 00:20:03,440
complacent.

319
00:20:03,440 --> 00:20:06,600
They lose any concern about catching it or passing it on.

320
00:20:06,600 --> 00:20:08,240
If I get corona, I get corona.

321
00:20:08,240 --> 00:20:11,480
At the end of the day, I'm not going to let it stop me from partying.

322
00:20:11,480 --> 00:20:14,720
Fortunately, Fox News has recently changed its tone.

323
00:20:14,720 --> 00:20:17,580
It's a virus like the flu.

324
00:20:17,580 --> 00:20:19,960
It actually can be mistaken for the flu.

325
00:20:19,960 --> 00:20:24,560
We are facing an incredibly contagious and dangerous virus.

326
00:20:24,560 --> 00:20:27,620
Tens of thousands of people die from the flu.

327
00:20:27,620 --> 00:20:29,080
Every year people die from the flu.

328
00:20:29,080 --> 00:20:33,240
We're fighting an invisible enemy and now slowing the spread is crucial.

329
00:20:33,240 --> 00:20:34,240
It is key.

330
00:20:34,240 --> 00:20:39,800
No, the time to slow the spread of the virus was crucial and key as soon as the first case

331
00:20:39,800 --> 00:20:42,640
was detected in the United States.

332
00:20:42,640 --> 00:20:46,560
Comparisons are often made with South Korea because South Korea and the United States

333
00:20:46,560 --> 00:20:51,920
both had their first case of the virus on the same day, January 20th.

334
00:20:51,920 --> 00:20:56,040
The South Korean government didn't pretend it had contained the virus, didn't question

335
00:20:56,040 --> 00:21:01,240
the medical advice, and assumed that the number of infections wouldn't rise.

336
00:21:01,240 --> 00:21:02,900
It took action.

337
00:21:02,900 --> 00:21:05,940
Within two weeks it had begun mass testing.

338
00:21:05,940 --> 00:21:12,720
It followed WHO guidelines, tested people who were at risk, got test results quickly,

339
00:21:12,720 --> 00:21:17,000
quarantined them if they tested positive, tested people who came into contact with those

340
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:22,160
who had tested positive, and then quarantined them if they tested positive.

341
00:21:22,160 --> 00:21:28,880
In just seven weeks the South Korean health authorities had tested 290,000 people without

342
00:21:28,880 --> 00:21:31,640
the need for a national lockdown.

343
00:21:31,640 --> 00:21:37,160
In the United States during the same period only 60,000 tests had been performed, even

344
00:21:37,160 --> 00:21:42,760
though the population is six times larger, and it took much longer to get test results.

345
00:21:42,760 --> 00:21:48,600
The idea of anybody getting it easily, the way people in other countries are doing it,

346
00:21:48,600 --> 00:21:50,180
we're not set up for that.

347
00:21:50,180 --> 00:21:51,440
Do I think we should be?

348
00:21:51,440 --> 00:21:53,360
Yes, but we're not.

349
00:21:53,360 --> 00:21:57,200
Nobody knew there'd be a pandemic or an epidemic of this proportion.

350
00:21:57,200 --> 00:21:59,540
Nobody's ever seen anything like this before.

351
00:21:59,540 --> 00:22:02,560
But of course that's not correct.

352
00:22:02,560 --> 00:22:07,460
Less than a year into his presidency, Foreign Affairs magazine warned that a pandemic could

353
00:22:07,460 --> 00:22:12,600
strike and that the Trump administration may be woefully unprepared.

354
00:22:12,600 --> 00:22:17,520
Three years into his presidency Trump should have read, or at least been briefed, about

355
00:22:17,520 --> 00:22:22,660
an intelligence report assessing worldwide threats, including the fact that the world

356
00:22:22,660 --> 00:22:28,360
was vulnerable to the next flu pandemic or large-scale outbreak of contagious disease

357
00:22:28,360 --> 00:22:32,460
that could lead to massive rates of death and disability.

358
00:22:32,460 --> 00:22:37,260
The previous administration set up a pandemic response team to prepare for just such an

359
00:22:37,260 --> 00:22:42,480
emergency but in 2018 the Trump administration disbanded it.

360
00:22:42,480 --> 00:22:47,140
The head of the response team, Timothy Zima, had to resign and members of the team were

361
00:22:47,140 --> 00:22:51,700
absorbed into other units within the National Security Council.

362
00:22:51,700 --> 00:22:56,700
Many experts warned that the move would leave the United States dangerously exposed to any

363
00:22:56,700 --> 00:22:57,700
pandemic.

364
00:22:57,700 --> 00:22:59,900
This isn't 20-20 hindsight.

365
00:22:59,900 --> 00:23:03,660
It was written two years before the current pandemic.

366
00:23:03,660 --> 00:23:08,200
The White House proposal is threatening to claw back funding whose precise purpose is

367
00:23:08,200 --> 00:23:13,820
to help the United States be able to respond quickly in the event of a crisis, said Carolyn

368
00:23:13,820 --> 00:23:18,900
Reynolds, a vice president at PATH, a global health technology non-profit.

369
00:23:18,900 --> 00:23:23,180
It seems to actively unlearn the lessons we learned through very hard experience over

370
00:23:23,180 --> 00:23:28,660
the last 15 years, said a senior policy fellow at the Center for Global Development.

371
00:23:28,660 --> 00:23:31,500
These moves make us materially less safe.

372
00:23:31,500 --> 00:23:33,500
It's inexplicable.

373
00:23:33,500 --> 00:23:36,100
So why did the Trump administration do it?

374
00:23:36,100 --> 00:23:38,740
Well, you'd have to ask the president.

375
00:23:38,740 --> 00:23:43,200
My first question is you said that you don't take responsibility, but you did disband the

376
00:23:43,200 --> 00:23:47,720
White House pandemic office and the officials that were working in that office left this

377
00:23:47,720 --> 00:23:49,180
administration abruptly.

378
00:23:49,180 --> 00:23:51,500
So what responsibility do you take to that?

379
00:23:51,500 --> 00:23:54,800
And the officials that worked in that office said that you, that the White House lost valuable

380
00:23:54,800 --> 00:23:57,380
time because that office was disbanded.

381
00:23:57,380 --> 00:23:58,380
What do you make of that?

382
00:23:58,380 --> 00:24:04,740
Well, I just think it's a nasty question because what we've done is, and Tony had said numerous

383
00:24:04,740 --> 00:24:09,660
times that we've saved thousands of lives because of the quick closing.

384
00:24:09,660 --> 00:24:11,400
And when you say me, I didn't do it.

385
00:24:11,400 --> 00:24:15,480
We have a group of people I could, I could ask perhaps the administration, but I could

386
00:24:15,480 --> 00:24:20,380
perhaps ask Tony about that because I don't know anything about it.

387
00:24:20,380 --> 00:24:26,240
As I said at the beginning, not every country has managed this crisis well, that's politics.

388
00:24:26,240 --> 00:24:30,300
And every country has had its share of McExperts, including my own.

389
00:24:30,300 --> 00:24:36,700
In spite of all the money spent on education, we revert to hysteria and alarmism.

390
00:24:36,700 --> 00:24:44,100
We now seem to be facing the health version of global warming, exaggeration in almost

391
00:24:44,100 --> 00:24:45,100
everything.

392
00:24:45,100 --> 00:24:49,180
The thing is most governments ignore these amateurs and prefer to go with professional

393
00:24:49,180 --> 00:24:53,100
scientific advice when it comes to issues of science.

394
00:24:53,100 --> 00:24:58,300
They'll inevitably be snafus and incompetence in response to any crisis.

395
00:24:58,300 --> 00:25:03,140
But what concerns me is that this is always compounded when leaders of countries don't

396
00:25:03,140 --> 00:25:09,180
accept scientific advice, downplay scientific reality and act on hunches and misinformed

397
00:25:09,180 --> 00:25:11,960
beliefs rather than science.

398
00:25:11,960 --> 00:25:15,540
That clearly has affected how the crisis is managed.

399
00:25:15,540 --> 00:25:20,340
A study from Oxford University found that while governments had varying delays in taking

400
00:25:20,340 --> 00:25:23,900
action, the US government delayed the longest.

401
00:25:23,900 --> 00:25:29,260
It waited until there were over 1,000 infections inside its borders before taking stringent

402
00:25:29,260 --> 00:25:31,300
measures against it.

403
00:25:31,300 --> 00:25:34,460
Only Britain came a close second.

404
00:25:34,460 --> 00:25:38,780
So this isn't a question of whether you support President Trump or you don't, whether you

405
00:25:38,780 --> 00:25:40,620
like him or loathe him.

406
00:25:40,620 --> 00:25:45,460
This is about scientific advice, taking precedence over political expediency.

407
00:25:45,460 --> 00:25:48,580
I hope that's something we should all be concerned about.
