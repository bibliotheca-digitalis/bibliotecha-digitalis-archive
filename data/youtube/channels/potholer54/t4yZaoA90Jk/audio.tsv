0	7240	On December 25th 2019, Dr Lu Xiaohong noticed a number of infections at his Wuhan hospital
7240	9820	that weren't responding to treatment.
9820	13980	It wasn't clear what was wrong with them, but tests quickly showed a coronavirus similar
13980	15460	to SARS.
15460	21100	Five days later, the director of the emergency department at Wuhan Central Hospital, Ai Fen,
21100	26920	noted the words SARS coronavirus on a patient's report being referred to an ophthalmologist.
26920	32320	At the same time, she alerted other doctors through the online forum WeChat.
32320	37880	When the ophthalmologist Li Wenliang saw it that day, he also posted a message, this time
37880	40740	on the social media site Weibo.
40740	45980	Li became famous for being questioned by the Public Security Bureau a few days later and
45980	50760	forced to sign a confession, admitting to disturbing the social order.
50760	52360	But he wasn't the only one.
52360	57920	Ai Fen and at least seven other whistleblowers were also officially admonished.
57920	63200	On December 31st, five days after the virus had first been detected, China alerted the
63200	65480	World Health Organisation.
65480	71200	But the Chinese authorities played down the threat and their report was overly optimistic.
71200	75600	They assured the WHO that the virus could be contained.
75600	78280	So the public was kept in the dark.
78280	83180	Even when the Wuhan seafood market was closed down the next day, the Chinese authorities
83180	88840	again played down the threat, claiming the closure was just for renovation.
88840	94700	In a land where the press is muzzled, there was no one to question them or investigate.
94700	99840	It wasn't until January 9th that the Chinese government finally admitted to the severity
99840	104300	of the outbreak and shared the sequencing of the genetic code.
104300	106960	The story became worldwide news.
106960	111640	That same day, the WHO alerted governments around the world and told them this was a
111640	115360	deadly new strain of coronavirus.
115360	117640	The reaction of those governments was mixed.
117640	123520	A balancing act between protecting civil liberties, economic health and public health are cultural
123520	126720	and political issues that I don't cover on this channel.
126720	132160	What does concern me is when governments don't understand or disregard scientific advice
132160	137980	and even misrepresent scientific facts in order for good public relations.
137980	142660	Because as the Chinese experience has shown, that has consequences.
142660	147800	In Brazil, President Bolsonaro brushed the new virus off, likening it to the flu.
147800	151840	And even several weeks after health experts in the United States were warning about the
151840	156520	severity and fatality of the new virus, President Trump did the same.
156520	157920	View this the same as the flu.
157920	163120	When somebody sneezes, I mean, I try and bail out as much as possible with this sneezing.
163120	168200	I mean, we've never closed the country before and we've had some pretty bad flus and we've
168200	170100	had some pretty bad viruses.
170100	175720	In fact, the new virus, officially called SARS-CoV-2, is very different to the flu.
175720	180560	Firstly, it's far more contagious, which means you have to take much stronger measures than
180560	183160	you would to protect yourself against flu.
183160	187520	Secondly, the flu has been around for a long time, so people have built up a large degree
187520	189440	of immunity to it.
189440	195280	When the new virus broke out, no one had immunity to it, because by definition it is new.
195280	200040	Thirdly, we have vaccines against the flu, which greatly reduces the number of people
200040	203440	infected and the seriousness of the infection.
203440	206920	There's no vaccine yet for the new coronavirus.
206920	210200	And fourthly, the mortality rate is much higher.
210200	215420	What kills you is not the virus itself, but the disease that comes from the virus.
215420	221540	So while the official name of the new coronavirus is SARS-CoV-2, the disease it causes is called
221540	223700	COVID-19.
223700	227900	President Trump made the argument that far more people are killed every year by the flu
227900	230700	than have been killed by COVID-19.
230700	233980	So does that mean the flu is more deadly than COVID-19?
233980	236460	No, of course not.
236460	240540	Comparing the number of deaths from COVID-19 at the start of an epidemic after just one
240540	246780	month, with the total annual number of deaths from flu, is not comparing like with like.
246780	249620	That means it's not science and it's misleading.
249620	253620	But I want to talk about the flu and the comparison to the coronavirus.
253620	256700	The flu has a fatality ratio of about 0.1 per cent.
256700	257700	Correct.
257700	258700	And the flu is higher than that.
258700	260260	The flu is much higher than that.
260260	261340	No it isn't.
261340	267340	The reporter, who happens to be a doctor and a medical correspondent, got the figure right.
267340	270860	The doctor has a death rate of about 0.1 per cent.
270860	271860	And COVID-19?
271860	277740	Report today the global death rate at 3.4 per cent and a report that the Olympics could
277740	278740	be delayed.
278740	279740	Your reaction to that?
279740	286500	Well, I think the 3.4 per cent is really a false number now and this is just my hunch.
286500	290580	No, the figure is correct because it's simple maths.
290580	296620	The number of deaths at the time of the study divided by the total number of reported cases.
296620	299580	That's the number of people who've tested positive.
299580	304580	It's known as the case fatality rate or, more colloquially, the death rate.
304580	307220	This was explained when the figure was given.
307220	313940	Globally, about 3.4 per cent of reported COVID-19 cases have died.
313940	316940	So it depends on the number of people being tested.
316940	320580	A lot of people aren't tested because they're asymptomatic.
320580	325300	In other words, they develop very mild or no symptoms and may not even bother contacting
325300	326600	a doctor.
326600	332180	If everyone who actually contracted COVID-19 was tested and counted, the case fatality
332180	334320	rate would be lower.
334320	337300	Researchers estimate that's around 1 per cent.
337300	342300	The death rate also depends on demographics because it's dramatically higher in older
342300	346060	people and those with underlying health conditions.
346060	350040	So the figure will vary from population to population.
350040	354840	The President shouldn't be relying on hunches to guess at these crucial figures.
354840	360080	He should be listening to experts who can explain what they are and what they mean.
360080	366680	Like epidemiologist Dr Anthony Fauci who had no trouble explaining it to members of Congress.
366680	370440	If you look at the cases that have come to the attention of the medical authorities in
370440	375680	China and you just do the math, the math is about 2 per cent.
375680	381720	If you look at certain age groups, certain risk groups, the fatality is much higher.
381720	390380	But as a group, it's going to depend completely on what the factor of asymptomatic cases are.
390380	394680	So if you have asymptomatic cases that are a lot, it's going to come down.
394680	401880	What we're hearing right now on a recent call from the WHO this morning is that there aren't
401880	408320	as many asymptomatic cases as we think, which made them elevate, I think, what their mortality
408320	409780	is.
409780	416680	You know, as well as anybody, that the mortality for seasonal flu is 0.1 per cent.
416680	422700	So even if it goes down to 1 per cent, it's still 10 times more fatal.
422700	427620	So if the President isn't taking the advice and accepting the figures of his own experts,
427620	431980	where is he getting his flu comparisons and erroneous figures from?
431980	436180	Well I'm no expert on his movements, but I do know he spends a lot of time watching Fox
436180	438800	News where he would have heard this.
438800	442680	In some years, tens of thousands of people die from the flu.
442680	444620	Every year people die from the flu.
444620	447500	It's a virus, like the flu.
447500	450080	It actually can be mistaken for the flu.
450080	453040	The President also came up with another suggestion.
453040	457320	You know, a lot of people think that goes away in April with the heat, as the heat comes
457320	458320	in.
458320	459320	We're in great shape though.
459320	462240	You know, in April, supposedly, it dies with the hotter weather.
462240	466560	Looks like by April, you know, in theory, when it gets a little warmer, it miraculously
466560	467560	goes away.
467560	468560	Hope that's true.
468560	469960	But what do you see as that?
469960	474680	Trump certainly didn't get that from his scientific advisors or from any experts, because there's
474680	476920	no evidence for it at all.
476920	482640	Now COVID-19 may start to subside in the spring and summer, but that'll be because all viruses
482640	484680	follow a bell curve.
484680	489300	But as thousands of cases in South East Asia and other tropical areas show, hot weather
489300	492060	is no impediment to this virus.
492060	494240	So where does the myth come from?
494240	497760	Of course, it's our old friend the internet.
497760	501980	This list, for example, has been passed around Facebook and Twitter from someone who claims
501980	505920	to have heard from someone whose uncle is a doctor in Shenzhen.
505920	510680	The poster said the man said his uncle said that the virus is killed by temperatures above
510680	513760	26 or 27 degrees.
513760	517880	If you're stupid enough to believe unsoiled crap on Twitter, I guess you're not smart
517880	522840	enough to wonder why the virus would then be able to thrive in normal body temperatures
522840	524940	of 37 degrees.
524940	530140	The BBC tracked down the person they say started the list, an 84-year-old man called Peter.
530140	535220	Everything I posted, I believed genuinely to be the truth and factual.
535220	539220	Oh, as long as you genuinely believed it, that's fine then.
539220	541700	Look, here's a better idea, Pete.
541700	544900	Stop spreading this junk science in the first place.
544900	549640	Because this is the kind of stuff President Trump sees, and before you know it, it overrides
549640	552800	the advice of his own scientific experts.
552800	556520	The frustrating thing is that the President doesn't need to get his information from the
556520	558520	internet or Fox News.
558520	564440	He has an infectious diseases expert standing right next to him at nearly every news conference.
564440	565960	One of many.
565960	570320	But for reasons I'll let you figure out, they can't tell the President directly.
570320	574780	They have to correct him in more subtle ways, like explaining the facts to someone else
574780	577200	while the President is listening.
577200	579840	But I don't have to tread on eggshells.
579840	584080	Thanks to freedom of speech, I can say no, especially to a President who's publicly giving
584080	589640	out misleading and overly optimistic information in the middle of a health crisis.
589640	599760	A drug called chloroquine, and some people would add to it, hydroxychloroquine.
599760	606220	No, they call hydroxychloroquine hydroxychloroquine because it's a different chemical and a different
606220	607220	drug.
607220	611220	It's toxic derivative of chloroquine and is used to treat different ailments.
611220	617780	But the nice part is it's been around for a long time, so we know that if things don't
617780	622980	go as planned, it's not going to kill anybody.
622980	625460	No, we don't know that at all.
625460	628740	That's why medical researchers have to do clinical trials.
628740	633660	Both of these drugs have side effects, sometimes dangerous side effects for people with certain
633660	635540	medical conditions.
635540	639380	And although anecdotal evidence suggests that they don't have any adverse effects
639380	645460	in Covid-19 patients, a proper trial is needed to ensure that if you give the drug to thousands
645460	649480	of people struggling to breathe, it won't end up killing them.
649480	655100	And it's shown very encouraging, very, very encouraging early results.
655100	657800	But this is just anecdotal evidence.
657800	661640	Doctors need to know what the side effects are, how much will be effective and over what
661640	663700	period of time.
663700	669980	And we're going to be able to make that drug available almost immediately.
669980	671720	No, you won't.
671720	676020	At the time of the press conference, it's only available to urgent cases and people
676020	678540	involved in clinical trials.
678540	683960	Most patients with Covid-19 won't have access to it until the clinical trials are over and
683960	686460	it's been approved to treat Covid-19.
686460	690060	And that's where the FDA has been so great.
690060	691800	They've gone through the approval process.
691800	692800	It's been approved.
692900	694680	No, they haven't.
694680	699240	Chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine have only been approved for their specified uses.
699240	702640	They haven't yet been approved for the treatment of Covid-19.
702640	703640	And they did it.
703640	708720	They took it down from many, many months to immediate.
708720	712320	So we're going to be able to make that drug available by prescription.
712320	717680	Again, only for urgent cases and people involved in the clinical trials.
717680	722960	It's fine to give people hope and to be optimistic, but not to mislead them.
722960	727880	These drugs may indeed prove to be effective, but we have to wait and see.
727880	733480	In the meantime, saying a cure is already here can lead to complacency and even dangerous
733480	735720	self-medication.
735720	740280	The experts can't contradict the president as bluntly as I have, so another trick they
740280	745280	use is to change what the president said to something that is correct and then pretend
745280	746920	the president had said it.
746920	751480	Many Americans have read studies and heard media reports about this drug chloroquine,
751480	753440	which is an anti-malarial drug.
753440	758240	It's already approved, as the president said, for the treatment of malaria, as well as an
758240	760320	arthritis condition evidence.
760320	765140	So as the commissioner of FDA and the president mentioned yesterday, we're trying to strike
765140	772220	a balance between making something with a potential of an effect to the American people
772220	776800	available at the same time that we do it under the auspices of a protocol that would give
776800	782200	us information to determine if it's truly safe and truly effective.
782200	786200	What the president was saying is that we're going to look at all of these drugs and we're
786200	792240	going to try to get them available in the context of some sort of a protocol where you
792240	795380	just don't distribute drugs willy-nilly.
795380	800520	You may make it more accessible than you would have previously, but you do it in the context
800520	805680	to at least get some feel for both safety and whether it works.
805680	811140	That was the message about the malaria drug hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine.
811140	815720	In a candid interview with the journal Science, Fauci admitted that he had to walk a fine
815720	816720	line.
816720	818500	The question was put to him.
818500	822600	Trump keeps saying that the travel ban for China, which began 2nd February, had a big
822600	827020	impact on slowing the spread of the virus to the United States and that he wishes China
827020	831520	would have told us three to four months earlier and that they were very secretive.
831520	833760	It just doesn't comport with facts.
833760	836720	Fauci said, I know, but what do you want me to do?
836720	839520	I mean, seriously, John, let's get real.
839520	841280	What do you want me to do?
841280	845740	And then the question, you're standing there as the representative of truth and facts and
845740	849360	things are being said that aren't true and aren't factual.
849360	854520	Fauci said, the way it happened is that after he made that statement, suggesting China could
854520	859680	have revealed the discovery of a new coronavirus three to four months earlier, I told the appropriate
859680	865380	people it doesn't comport because two to three months earlier would have been September.
865380	869560	The next time they sit down with him and talk about what he's going to say, they'll say,
869560	873800	by the way, Mr President, be careful about this and don't say that.
873800	876960	But I can't jump in front of a microphone and push him down.
876960	881960	OK, he said it, let's try and get it corrected for the next time.
881960	883980	The three months referred to this comment.
883980	886680	Our relationship with China is a very good relationship.
886680	891080	I wish they told us three months sooner that this was a problem.
891080	893460	We didn't know about it.
893460	896840	They knew about it and they should have told us we could have saved a lot of lives throughout
896840	897840	the world.
897840	901760	But the United States did know about it as early as January the 9th.
901760	904260	The WHO put out a worldwide alert.
904260	907440	It was even reported in the American media.
907440	912320	Six days later, a passenger flight from Wuhan brought the virus to the United States and
912320	915400	was diagnosed on January the 20th.
915400	919880	By January 22nd, the virus had spread to 10 other countries and thousands of people
919880	921600	were infected.
921600	925360	And this was the president's reaction that day in Davos.
925360	926760	Have you been briefed by the CDC?
926760	927760	They have.
927760	929360	Are there words about a pandemic at this point?
929360	933040	No, we're not at all and we have it totally under control.
933040	937980	It's one person coming in from China and we have it under control.
937980	939840	It's going to be just fine.
939840	944480	And it wasn't until a week later and three weeks after the US had been notified about
944480	949400	the severity of the virus that the Trump administration set up a task force to monitor
949400	950400	it.
950400	955760	Two days later, it finally ordered the quarantining of visitors from the infected countries.
955760	957660	By then, it was too late.
957660	964200	The virus was already present inside the USA and spreading and not enough testing was being
964200	966360	done to contain it.
966360	970760	A month later, more than seven weeks after the US government had been alerted to the
970760	975600	severity of the new virus, hospitals and labs were finally allowed to conduct their
975600	978320	own COVID-19 tests.
978320	983260	In the meantime, attempts to minimise the outbreak continued, completely contrary to
983260	986560	the science and to the medical advice being given.
986560	987880	We have it totally under control.
987880	989240	It's one person.
989240	991120	We think we have it very well under control.
991120	994280	We pretty much shut it down coming in from China.
994280	997280	And I think the numbers are going to get progressively better as we go along.
997280	1000040	We have it very much under control in this country.
1000040	1001040	People are getting better.
1001040	1002040	They're all getting better.
1002040	1008360	The coronavirus, which is very well under control in our country.
1008360	1012240	And the 15 within a couple of days is going to be down to close to zero.
1012240	1017440	Because of all we've done, the risk to the American people remains very low.
1017440	1020120	The coronavirus, you know that, right?
1020120	1021120	Coronavirus.
1021120	1023200	And this is their new hoax.
1023200	1025920	We're talking about very small numbers in the United States.
1025920	1028580	Our numbers are lower than just about anybody.
1028580	1032860	Saying we have it under control and have stopped it several weeks after the first case
1032860	1038920	was detected and while infection rates were rapidly rising is exactly what China was criticised
1038920	1042480	for during the two weeks of its rosy denials.
1042480	1047740	But when image and public relations confront reality, it's reality that will eventually
1047740	1048740	win.
1048740	1053820	I've always known this is a, this is a real, this is a pandemic.
1053820	1058560	But there are worrying signs that the president still only wants to hear good news and even
1058560	1061840	criticise the media for reporting bad news.
1061840	1065600	One of his first actions after appointing Mike Pence's response team at the end of
1065600	1068440	February was to muzzle health officials.
1068440	1073000	Dr Fauci was told he had to get clearance through the vice president's office before
1073000	1074840	talking to the media.
1074840	1079200	I don't really care if I get in trouble for speaking to the media.
1079200	1084920	I want people to know that this is bad.
1084920	1086400	People are dying.
1086400	1091160	We don't have the tools that we need in the emergency department and in the hospital to
1091160	1099880	take care of them and, and it's really hard.
1099880	1104000	The frustrating thing about all of this is it really just feels like it's too little,
1104000	1105000	too late.
1105000	1108720	Like we knew, we knew it was coming.
1108720	1112200	What do you say to Americans who are watching you right now who are scared?
1112200	1114200	I say that you're a terrible reporter.
1114200	1115200	That's what I say.
1115200	1120600	I think it's a very nasty question and I think it's a very bad signal that you're putting
1120600	1122240	out to the American people.
1122240	1126340	The American people are looking for answers and they're looking for hope.
1126340	1128120	That's really bad reporting.
1128120	1133240	No, the answer to that very sensible question should be, I want to reassure Americans who
1133240	1135880	are scared that we'll get through this.
1135880	1139120	You don't need to be scared, but you do need to be cautious.
1139120	1141040	Follow the medical advice.
1141040	1146200	If we do those things together as a nation, we'll get through this more safely and more
1146200	1147200	quickly.
1147200	1151800	In other words, you give people hope by being honest with them, not painting a false picture
1151800	1156660	of the science and then blaming the press for not doing the same.
1156660	1161240	Because science is about reality, it deals with the way things really are, not the way
1161240	1166040	we wish they were or hope they'll be or think they ought to be.
1166040	1170440	Reality doesn't change depending on your nationality or your religious, political or
1170440	1173300	ideological position.
1173300	1177320	When people are forced to choose between believing a politician they like and a scientist they
1177320	1182320	don't know, they'll often go with the politician and reject the science.
1182320	1187400	That's why only 40% of Republicans who trusted the President thought the worst was yet to
1187400	1191240	come as opposed to 80% of Democrats.
1191240	1193080	And here's the problem with that.
1193080	1197320	When people believe their President's claim that the virus is no worse than the flu and
1197320	1202320	it's already been stopped, and they see him shaking hands and holding rallies, they become
1202320	1203440	complacent.
1203440	1206600	They lose any concern about catching it or passing it on.
1206600	1208240	If I get corona, I get corona.
1208240	1211480	At the end of the day, I'm not going to let it stop me from partying.
1211480	1214720	Fortunately, Fox News has recently changed its tone.
1214720	1217580	It's a virus like the flu.
1217580	1219960	It actually can be mistaken for the flu.
1219960	1224560	We are facing an incredibly contagious and dangerous virus.
1224560	1227620	Tens of thousands of people die from the flu.
1227620	1229080	Every year people die from the flu.
1229080	1233240	We're fighting an invisible enemy and now slowing the spread is crucial.
1233240	1234240	It is key.
1234240	1239800	No, the time to slow the spread of the virus was crucial and key as soon as the first case
1239800	1242640	was detected in the United States.
1242640	1246560	Comparisons are often made with South Korea because South Korea and the United States
1246560	1251920	both had their first case of the virus on the same day, January 20th.
1251920	1256040	The South Korean government didn't pretend it had contained the virus, didn't question
1256040	1261240	the medical advice, and assumed that the number of infections wouldn't rise.
1261240	1262900	It took action.
1262900	1265940	Within two weeks it had begun mass testing.
1265940	1272720	It followed WHO guidelines, tested people who were at risk, got test results quickly,
1272720	1277000	quarantined them if they tested positive, tested people who came into contact with those
1277000	1282160	who had tested positive, and then quarantined them if they tested positive.
1282160	1288880	In just seven weeks the South Korean health authorities had tested 290,000 people without
1288880	1291640	the need for a national lockdown.
1291640	1297160	In the United States during the same period only 60,000 tests had been performed, even
1297160	1302760	though the population is six times larger, and it took much longer to get test results.
1302760	1308600	The idea of anybody getting it easily, the way people in other countries are doing it,
1308600	1310180	we're not set up for that.
1310180	1311440	Do I think we should be?
1311440	1313360	Yes, but we're not.
1313360	1317200	Nobody knew there'd be a pandemic or an epidemic of this proportion.
1317200	1319540	Nobody's ever seen anything like this before.
1319540	1322560	But of course that's not correct.
1322560	1327460	Less than a year into his presidency, Foreign Affairs magazine warned that a pandemic could
1327460	1332600	strike and that the Trump administration may be woefully unprepared.
1332600	1337520	Three years into his presidency Trump should have read, or at least been briefed, about
1337520	1342660	an intelligence report assessing worldwide threats, including the fact that the world
1342660	1348360	was vulnerable to the next flu pandemic or large-scale outbreak of contagious disease
1348360	1352460	that could lead to massive rates of death and disability.
1352460	1357260	The previous administration set up a pandemic response team to prepare for just such an
1357260	1362480	emergency but in 2018 the Trump administration disbanded it.
1362480	1367140	The head of the response team, Timothy Zima, had to resign and members of the team were
1367140	1371700	absorbed into other units within the National Security Council.
1371700	1376700	Many experts warned that the move would leave the United States dangerously exposed to any
1376700	1377700	pandemic.
1377700	1379900	This isn't 20-20 hindsight.
1379900	1383660	It was written two years before the current pandemic.
1383660	1388200	The White House proposal is threatening to claw back funding whose precise purpose is
1388200	1393820	to help the United States be able to respond quickly in the event of a crisis, said Carolyn
1393820	1398900	Reynolds, a vice president at PATH, a global health technology non-profit.
1398900	1403180	It seems to actively unlearn the lessons we learned through very hard experience over
1403180	1408660	the last 15 years, said a senior policy fellow at the Center for Global Development.
1408660	1411500	These moves make us materially less safe.
1411500	1413500	It's inexplicable.
1413500	1416100	So why did the Trump administration do it?
1416100	1418740	Well, you'd have to ask the president.
1418740	1423200	My first question is you said that you don't take responsibility, but you did disband the
1423200	1427720	White House pandemic office and the officials that were working in that office left this
1427720	1429180	administration abruptly.
1429180	1431500	So what responsibility do you take to that?
1431500	1434800	And the officials that worked in that office said that you, that the White House lost valuable
1434800	1437380	time because that office was disbanded.
1437380	1438380	What do you make of that?
1438380	1444740	Well, I just think it's a nasty question because what we've done is, and Tony had said numerous
1444740	1449660	times that we've saved thousands of lives because of the quick closing.
1449660	1451400	And when you say me, I didn't do it.
1451400	1455480	We have a group of people I could, I could ask perhaps the administration, but I could
1455480	1460380	perhaps ask Tony about that because I don't know anything about it.
1460380	1466240	As I said at the beginning, not every country has managed this crisis well, that's politics.
1466240	1470300	And every country has had its share of McExperts, including my own.
1470300	1476700	In spite of all the money spent on education, we revert to hysteria and alarmism.
1476700	1484100	We now seem to be facing the health version of global warming, exaggeration in almost
1484100	1485100	everything.
1485100	1489180	The thing is most governments ignore these amateurs and prefer to go with professional
1489180	1493100	scientific advice when it comes to issues of science.
1493100	1498300	They'll inevitably be snafus and incompetence in response to any crisis.
1498300	1503140	But what concerns me is that this is always compounded when leaders of countries don't
1503140	1509180	accept scientific advice, downplay scientific reality and act on hunches and misinformed
1509180	1511960	beliefs rather than science.
1511960	1515540	That clearly has affected how the crisis is managed.
1515540	1520340	A study from Oxford University found that while governments had varying delays in taking
1520340	1523900	action, the US government delayed the longest.
1523900	1529260	It waited until there were over 1,000 infections inside its borders before taking stringent
1529260	1531300	measures against it.
1531300	1534460	Only Britain came a close second.
1534460	1538780	So this isn't a question of whether you support President Trump or you don't, whether you
1538780	1540620	like him or loathe him.
1540620	1545460	This is about scientific advice, taking precedence over political expediency.
1545460	1548580	I hope that's something we should all be concerned about.
