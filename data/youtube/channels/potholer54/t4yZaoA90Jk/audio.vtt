00:00.000 --> 00:07.240
On December 25th 2019, Dr Lu Xiaohong noticed a number of infections at his Wuhan hospital

00:07.240 --> 00:09.820
that weren't responding to treatment.

00:09.820 --> 00:13.980
It wasn't clear what was wrong with them, but tests quickly showed a coronavirus similar

00:13.980 --> 00:15.460
to SARS.

00:15.460 --> 00:21.100
Five days later, the director of the emergency department at Wuhan Central Hospital, Ai Fen,

00:21.100 --> 00:26.920
noted the words SARS coronavirus on a patient's report being referred to an ophthalmologist.

00:26.920 --> 00:32.320
At the same time, she alerted other doctors through the online forum WeChat.

00:32.320 --> 00:37.880
When the ophthalmologist Li Wenliang saw it that day, he also posted a message, this time

00:37.880 --> 00:40.740
on the social media site Weibo.

00:40.740 --> 00:45.980
Li became famous for being questioned by the Public Security Bureau a few days later and

00:45.980 --> 00:50.760
forced to sign a confession, admitting to disturbing the social order.

00:50.760 --> 00:52.360
But he wasn't the only one.

00:52.360 --> 00:57.920
Ai Fen and at least seven other whistleblowers were also officially admonished.

00:57.920 --> 01:03.200
On December 31st, five days after the virus had first been detected, China alerted the

01:03.200 --> 01:05.480
World Health Organisation.

01:05.480 --> 01:11.200
But the Chinese authorities played down the threat and their report was overly optimistic.

01:11.200 --> 01:15.600
They assured the WHO that the virus could be contained.

01:15.600 --> 01:18.280
So the public was kept in the dark.

01:18.280 --> 01:23.180
Even when the Wuhan seafood market was closed down the next day, the Chinese authorities

01:23.180 --> 01:28.840
again played down the threat, claiming the closure was just for renovation.

01:28.840 --> 01:34.700
In a land where the press is muzzled, there was no one to question them or investigate.

01:34.700 --> 01:39.840
It wasn't until January 9th that the Chinese government finally admitted to the severity

01:39.840 --> 01:44.300
of the outbreak and shared the sequencing of the genetic code.

01:44.300 --> 01:46.960
The story became worldwide news.

01:46.960 --> 01:51.640
That same day, the WHO alerted governments around the world and told them this was a

01:51.640 --> 01:55.360
deadly new strain of coronavirus.

01:55.360 --> 01:57.640
The reaction of those governments was mixed.

01:57.640 --> 02:03.520
A balancing act between protecting civil liberties, economic health and public health are cultural

02:03.520 --> 02:06.720
and political issues that I don't cover on this channel.

02:06.720 --> 02:12.160
What does concern me is when governments don't understand or disregard scientific advice

02:12.160 --> 02:17.980
and even misrepresent scientific facts in order for good public relations.

02:17.980 --> 02:22.660
Because as the Chinese experience has shown, that has consequences.

02:22.660 --> 02:27.800
In Brazil, President Bolsonaro brushed the new virus off, likening it to the flu.

02:27.800 --> 02:31.840
And even several weeks after health experts in the United States were warning about the

02:31.840 --> 02:36.520
severity and fatality of the new virus, President Trump did the same.

02:36.520 --> 02:37.920
View this the same as the flu.

02:37.920 --> 02:43.120
When somebody sneezes, I mean, I try and bail out as much as possible with this sneezing.

02:43.120 --> 02:48.200
I mean, we've never closed the country before and we've had some pretty bad flus and we've

02:48.200 --> 02:50.100
had some pretty bad viruses.

02:50.100 --> 02:55.720
In fact, the new virus, officially called SARS-CoV-2, is very different to the flu.

02:55.720 --> 03:00.560
Firstly, it's far more contagious, which means you have to take much stronger measures than

03:00.560 --> 03:03.160
you would to protect yourself against flu.

03:03.160 --> 03:07.520
Secondly, the flu has been around for a long time, so people have built up a large degree

03:07.520 --> 03:09.440
of immunity to it.

03:09.440 --> 03:15.280
When the new virus broke out, no one had immunity to it, because by definition it is new.

03:15.280 --> 03:20.040
Thirdly, we have vaccines against the flu, which greatly reduces the number of people

03:20.040 --> 03:23.440
infected and the seriousness of the infection.

03:23.440 --> 03:26.920
There's no vaccine yet for the new coronavirus.

03:26.920 --> 03:30.200
And fourthly, the mortality rate is much higher.

03:30.200 --> 03:35.420
What kills you is not the virus itself, but the disease that comes from the virus.

03:35.420 --> 03:41.540
So while the official name of the new coronavirus is SARS-CoV-2, the disease it causes is called

03:41.540 --> 03:43.700
COVID-19.

03:43.700 --> 03:47.900
President Trump made the argument that far more people are killed every year by the flu

03:47.900 --> 03:50.700
than have been killed by COVID-19.

03:50.700 --> 03:53.980
So does that mean the flu is more deadly than COVID-19?

03:53.980 --> 03:56.460
No, of course not.

03:56.460 --> 04:00.540
Comparing the number of deaths from COVID-19 at the start of an epidemic after just one

04:00.540 --> 04:06.780
month, with the total annual number of deaths from flu, is not comparing like with like.

04:06.780 --> 04:09.620
That means it's not science and it's misleading.

04:09.620 --> 04:13.620
But I want to talk about the flu and the comparison to the coronavirus.

04:13.620 --> 04:16.700
The flu has a fatality ratio of about 0.1 per cent.

04:16.700 --> 04:17.700
Correct.

04:17.700 --> 04:18.700
And the flu is higher than that.

04:18.700 --> 04:20.260
The flu is much higher than that.

04:20.260 --> 04:21.340
No it isn't.

04:21.340 --> 04:27.340
The reporter, who happens to be a doctor and a medical correspondent, got the figure right.

04:27.340 --> 04:30.860
The doctor has a death rate of about 0.1 per cent.

04:30.860 --> 04:31.860
And COVID-19?

04:31.860 --> 04:37.740
Report today the global death rate at 3.4 per cent and a report that the Olympics could

04:37.740 --> 04:38.740
be delayed.

04:38.740 --> 04:39.740
Your reaction to that?

04:39.740 --> 04:46.500
Well, I think the 3.4 per cent is really a false number now and this is just my hunch.

04:46.500 --> 04:50.580
No, the figure is correct because it's simple maths.

04:50.580 --> 04:56.620
The number of deaths at the time of the study divided by the total number of reported cases.

04:56.620 --> 04:59.580
That's the number of people who've tested positive.

04:59.580 --> 05:04.580
It's known as the case fatality rate or, more colloquially, the death rate.

05:04.580 --> 05:07.220
This was explained when the figure was given.

05:07.220 --> 05:13.940
Globally, about 3.4 per cent of reported COVID-19 cases have died.

05:13.940 --> 05:16.940
So it depends on the number of people being tested.

05:16.940 --> 05:20.580
A lot of people aren't tested because they're asymptomatic.

05:20.580 --> 05:25.300
In other words, they develop very mild or no symptoms and may not even bother contacting

05:25.300 --> 05:26.600
a doctor.

05:26.600 --> 05:32.180
If everyone who actually contracted COVID-19 was tested and counted, the case fatality

05:32.180 --> 05:34.320
rate would be lower.

05:34.320 --> 05:37.300
Researchers estimate that's around 1 per cent.

05:37.300 --> 05:42.300
The death rate also depends on demographics because it's dramatically higher in older

05:42.300 --> 05:46.060
people and those with underlying health conditions.

05:46.060 --> 05:50.040
So the figure will vary from population to population.

05:50.040 --> 05:54.840
The President shouldn't be relying on hunches to guess at these crucial figures.

05:54.840 --> 06:00.080
He should be listening to experts who can explain what they are and what they mean.

06:00.080 --> 06:06.680
Like epidemiologist Dr Anthony Fauci who had no trouble explaining it to members of Congress.

06:06.680 --> 06:10.440
If you look at the cases that have come to the attention of the medical authorities in

06:10.440 --> 06:15.680
China and you just do the math, the math is about 2 per cent.

06:15.680 --> 06:21.720
If you look at certain age groups, certain risk groups, the fatality is much higher.

06:21.720 --> 06:30.380
But as a group, it's going to depend completely on what the factor of asymptomatic cases are.

06:30.380 --> 06:34.680
So if you have asymptomatic cases that are a lot, it's going to come down.

06:34.680 --> 06:41.880
What we're hearing right now on a recent call from the WHO this morning is that there aren't

06:41.880 --> 06:48.320
as many asymptomatic cases as we think, which made them elevate, I think, what their mortality

06:48.320 --> 06:49.780
is.

06:49.780 --> 06:56.680
You know, as well as anybody, that the mortality for seasonal flu is 0.1 per cent.

06:56.680 --> 07:02.700
So even if it goes down to 1 per cent, it's still 10 times more fatal.

07:02.700 --> 07:07.620
So if the President isn't taking the advice and accepting the figures of his own experts,

07:07.620 --> 07:11.980
where is he getting his flu comparisons and erroneous figures from?

07:11.980 --> 07:16.180
Well I'm no expert on his movements, but I do know he spends a lot of time watching Fox

07:16.180 --> 07:18.800
News where he would have heard this.

07:18.800 --> 07:22.680
In some years, tens of thousands of people die from the flu.

07:22.680 --> 07:24.620
Every year people die from the flu.

07:24.620 --> 07:27.500
It's a virus, like the flu.

07:27.500 --> 07:30.080
It actually can be mistaken for the flu.

07:30.080 --> 07:33.040
The President also came up with another suggestion.

07:33.040 --> 07:37.320
You know, a lot of people think that goes away in April with the heat, as the heat comes

07:37.320 --> 07:38.320
in.

07:38.320 --> 07:39.320
We're in great shape though.

07:39.320 --> 07:42.240
You know, in April, supposedly, it dies with the hotter weather.

07:42.240 --> 07:46.560
Looks like by April, you know, in theory, when it gets a little warmer, it miraculously

07:46.560 --> 07:47.560
goes away.

07:47.560 --> 07:48.560
Hope that's true.

07:48.560 --> 07:49.960
But what do you see as that?

07:49.960 --> 07:54.680
Trump certainly didn't get that from his scientific advisors or from any experts, because there's

07:54.680 --> 07:56.920
no evidence for it at all.

07:56.920 --> 08:02.640
Now COVID-19 may start to subside in the spring and summer, but that'll be because all viruses

08:02.640 --> 08:04.680
follow a bell curve.

08:04.680 --> 08:09.300
But as thousands of cases in South East Asia and other tropical areas show, hot weather

08:09.300 --> 08:12.060
is no impediment to this virus.

08:12.060 --> 08:14.240
So where does the myth come from?

08:14.240 --> 08:17.760
Of course, it's our old friend the internet.

08:17.760 --> 08:21.980
This list, for example, has been passed around Facebook and Twitter from someone who claims

08:21.980 --> 08:25.920
to have heard from someone whose uncle is a doctor in Shenzhen.

08:25.920 --> 08:30.680
The poster said the man said his uncle said that the virus is killed by temperatures above

08:30.680 --> 08:33.760
26 or 27 degrees.

08:33.760 --> 08:37.880
If you're stupid enough to believe unsoiled crap on Twitter, I guess you're not smart

08:37.880 --> 08:42.840
enough to wonder why the virus would then be able to thrive in normal body temperatures

08:42.840 --> 08:44.940
of 37 degrees.

08:44.940 --> 08:50.140
The BBC tracked down the person they say started the list, an 84-year-old man called Peter.

08:50.140 --> 08:55.220
Everything I posted, I believed genuinely to be the truth and factual.

08:55.220 --> 08:59.220
Oh, as long as you genuinely believed it, that's fine then.

08:59.220 --> 09:01.700
Look, here's a better idea, Pete.

09:01.700 --> 09:04.900
Stop spreading this junk science in the first place.

09:04.900 --> 09:09.640
Because this is the kind of stuff President Trump sees, and before you know it, it overrides

09:09.640 --> 09:12.800
the advice of his own scientific experts.

09:12.800 --> 09:16.520
The frustrating thing is that the President doesn't need to get his information from the

09:16.520 --> 09:18.520
internet or Fox News.

09:18.520 --> 09:24.440
He has an infectious diseases expert standing right next to him at nearly every news conference.

09:24.440 --> 09:25.960
One of many.

09:25.960 --> 09:30.320
But for reasons I'll let you figure out, they can't tell the President directly.

09:30.320 --> 09:34.780
They have to correct him in more subtle ways, like explaining the facts to someone else

09:34.780 --> 09:37.200
while the President is listening.

09:37.200 --> 09:39.840
But I don't have to tread on eggshells.

09:39.840 --> 09:44.080
Thanks to freedom of speech, I can say no, especially to a President who's publicly giving

09:44.080 --> 09:49.640
out misleading and overly optimistic information in the middle of a health crisis.

09:49.640 --> 09:59.760
A drug called chloroquine, and some people would add to it, hydroxychloroquine.

09:59.760 --> 10:06.220
No, they call hydroxychloroquine hydroxychloroquine because it's a different chemical and a different

10:06.220 --> 10:07.220
drug.

10:07.220 --> 10:11.220
It's toxic derivative of chloroquine and is used to treat different ailments.

10:11.220 --> 10:17.780
But the nice part is it's been around for a long time, so we know that if things don't

10:17.780 --> 10:22.980
go as planned, it's not going to kill anybody.

10:22.980 --> 10:25.460
No, we don't know that at all.

10:25.460 --> 10:28.740
That's why medical researchers have to do clinical trials.

10:28.740 --> 10:33.660
Both of these drugs have side effects, sometimes dangerous side effects for people with certain

10:33.660 --> 10:35.540
medical conditions.

10:35.540 --> 10:39.380
And although anecdotal evidence suggests that they don't have any adverse effects

10:39.380 --> 10:45.460
in Covid-19 patients, a proper trial is needed to ensure that if you give the drug to thousands

10:45.460 --> 10:49.480
of people struggling to breathe, it won't end up killing them.

10:49.480 --> 10:55.100
And it's shown very encouraging, very, very encouraging early results.

10:55.100 --> 10:57.800
But this is just anecdotal evidence.

10:57.800 --> 11:01.640
Doctors need to know what the side effects are, how much will be effective and over what

11:01.640 --> 11:03.700
period of time.

11:03.700 --> 11:09.980
And we're going to be able to make that drug available almost immediately.

11:09.980 --> 11:11.720
No, you won't.

11:11.720 --> 11:16.020
At the time of the press conference, it's only available to urgent cases and people

11:16.020 --> 11:18.540
involved in clinical trials.

11:18.540 --> 11:23.960
Most patients with Covid-19 won't have access to it until the clinical trials are over and

11:23.960 --> 11:26.460
it's been approved to treat Covid-19.

11:26.460 --> 11:30.060
And that's where the FDA has been so great.

11:30.060 --> 11:31.800
They've gone through the approval process.

11:31.800 --> 11:32.800
It's been approved.

11:32.900 --> 11:34.680
No, they haven't.

11:34.680 --> 11:39.240
Chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine have only been approved for their specified uses.

11:39.240 --> 11:42.640
They haven't yet been approved for the treatment of Covid-19.

11:42.640 --> 11:43.640
And they did it.

11:43.640 --> 11:48.720
They took it down from many, many months to immediate.

11:48.720 --> 11:52.320
So we're going to be able to make that drug available by prescription.

11:52.320 --> 11:57.680
Again, only for urgent cases and people involved in the clinical trials.

11:57.680 --> 12:02.960
It's fine to give people hope and to be optimistic, but not to mislead them.

12:02.960 --> 12:07.880
These drugs may indeed prove to be effective, but we have to wait and see.

12:07.880 --> 12:13.480
In the meantime, saying a cure is already here can lead to complacency and even dangerous

12:13.480 --> 12:15.720
self-medication.

12:15.720 --> 12:20.280
The experts can't contradict the president as bluntly as I have, so another trick they

12:20.280 --> 12:25.280
use is to change what the president said to something that is correct and then pretend

12:25.280 --> 12:26.920
the president had said it.

12:26.920 --> 12:31.480
Many Americans have read studies and heard media reports about this drug chloroquine,

12:31.480 --> 12:33.440
which is an anti-malarial drug.

12:33.440 --> 12:38.240
It's already approved, as the president said, for the treatment of malaria, as well as an

12:38.240 --> 12:40.320
arthritis condition evidence.

12:40.320 --> 12:45.140
So as the commissioner of FDA and the president mentioned yesterday, we're trying to strike

12:45.140 --> 12:52.220
a balance between making something with a potential of an effect to the American people

12:52.220 --> 12:56.800
available at the same time that we do it under the auspices of a protocol that would give

12:56.800 --> 13:02.200
us information to determine if it's truly safe and truly effective.

13:02.200 --> 13:06.200
What the president was saying is that we're going to look at all of these drugs and we're

13:06.200 --> 13:12.240
going to try to get them available in the context of some sort of a protocol where you

13:12.240 --> 13:15.380
just don't distribute drugs willy-nilly.

13:15.380 --> 13:20.520
You may make it more accessible than you would have previously, but you do it in the context

13:20.520 --> 13:25.680
to at least get some feel for both safety and whether it works.

13:25.680 --> 13:31.140
That was the message about the malaria drug hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine.

13:31.140 --> 13:35.720
In a candid interview with the journal Science, Fauci admitted that he had to walk a fine

13:35.720 --> 13:36.720
line.

13:36.720 --> 13:38.500
The question was put to him.

13:38.500 --> 13:42.600
Trump keeps saying that the travel ban for China, which began 2nd February, had a big

13:42.600 --> 13:47.020
impact on slowing the spread of the virus to the United States and that he wishes China

13:47.020 --> 13:51.520
would have told us three to four months earlier and that they were very secretive.

13:51.520 --> 13:53.760
It just doesn't comport with facts.

13:53.760 --> 13:56.720
Fauci said, I know, but what do you want me to do?

13:56.720 --> 13:59.520
I mean, seriously, John, let's get real.

13:59.520 --> 14:01.280
What do you want me to do?

14:01.280 --> 14:05.740
And then the question, you're standing there as the representative of truth and facts and

14:05.740 --> 14:09.360
things are being said that aren't true and aren't factual.

14:09.360 --> 14:14.520
Fauci said, the way it happened is that after he made that statement, suggesting China could

14:14.520 --> 14:19.680
have revealed the discovery of a new coronavirus three to four months earlier, I told the appropriate

14:19.680 --> 14:25.380
people it doesn't comport because two to three months earlier would have been September.

14:25.380 --> 14:29.560
The next time they sit down with him and talk about what he's going to say, they'll say,

14:29.560 --> 14:33.800
by the way, Mr President, be careful about this and don't say that.

14:33.800 --> 14:36.960
But I can't jump in front of a microphone and push him down.

14:36.960 --> 14:41.960
OK, he said it, let's try and get it corrected for the next time.

14:41.960 --> 14:43.980
The three months referred to this comment.

14:43.980 --> 14:46.680
Our relationship with China is a very good relationship.

14:46.680 --> 14:51.080
I wish they told us three months sooner that this was a problem.

14:51.080 --> 14:53.460
We didn't know about it.

14:53.460 --> 14:56.840
They knew about it and they should have told us we could have saved a lot of lives throughout

14:56.840 --> 14:57.840
the world.

14:57.840 --> 15:01.760
But the United States did know about it as early as January the 9th.

15:01.760 --> 15:04.260
The WHO put out a worldwide alert.

15:04.260 --> 15:07.440
It was even reported in the American media.

15:07.440 --> 15:12.320
Six days later, a passenger flight from Wuhan brought the virus to the United States and

15:12.320 --> 15:15.400
was diagnosed on January the 20th.

15:15.400 --> 15:19.880
By January 22nd, the virus had spread to 10 other countries and thousands of people

15:19.880 --> 15:21.600
were infected.

15:21.600 --> 15:25.360
And this was the president's reaction that day in Davos.

15:25.360 --> 15:26.760
Have you been briefed by the CDC?

15:26.760 --> 15:27.760
They have.

15:27.760 --> 15:29.360
Are there words about a pandemic at this point?

15:29.360 --> 15:33.040
No, we're not at all and we have it totally under control.

15:33.040 --> 15:37.980
It's one person coming in from China and we have it under control.

15:37.980 --> 15:39.840
It's going to be just fine.

15:39.840 --> 15:44.480
And it wasn't until a week later and three weeks after the US had been notified about

15:44.480 --> 15:49.400
the severity of the virus that the Trump administration set up a task force to monitor

15:49.400 --> 15:50.400
it.

15:50.400 --> 15:55.760
Two days later, it finally ordered the quarantining of visitors from the infected countries.

15:55.760 --> 15:57.660
By then, it was too late.

15:57.660 --> 16:04.200
The virus was already present inside the USA and spreading and not enough testing was being

16:04.200 --> 16:06.360
done to contain it.

16:06.360 --> 16:10.760
A month later, more than seven weeks after the US government had been alerted to the

16:10.760 --> 16:15.600
severity of the new virus, hospitals and labs were finally allowed to conduct their

16:15.600 --> 16:18.320
own COVID-19 tests.

16:18.320 --> 16:23.260
In the meantime, attempts to minimise the outbreak continued, completely contrary to

16:23.260 --> 16:26.560
the science and to the medical advice being given.

16:26.560 --> 16:27.880
We have it totally under control.

16:27.880 --> 16:29.240
It's one person.

16:29.240 --> 16:31.120
We think we have it very well under control.

16:31.120 --> 16:34.280
We pretty much shut it down coming in from China.

16:34.280 --> 16:37.280
And I think the numbers are going to get progressively better as we go along.

16:37.280 --> 16:40.040
We have it very much under control in this country.

16:40.040 --> 16:41.040
People are getting better.

16:41.040 --> 16:42.040
They're all getting better.

16:42.040 --> 16:48.360
The coronavirus, which is very well under control in our country.

16:48.360 --> 16:52.240
And the 15 within a couple of days is going to be down to close to zero.

16:52.240 --> 16:57.440
Because of all we've done, the risk to the American people remains very low.

16:57.440 --> 17:00.120
The coronavirus, you know that, right?

17:00.120 --> 17:01.120
Coronavirus.

17:01.120 --> 17:03.200
And this is their new hoax.

17:03.200 --> 17:05.920
We're talking about very small numbers in the United States.

17:05.920 --> 17:08.580
Our numbers are lower than just about anybody.

17:08.580 --> 17:12.860
Saying we have it under control and have stopped it several weeks after the first case

17:12.860 --> 17:18.920
was detected and while infection rates were rapidly rising is exactly what China was criticised

17:18.920 --> 17:22.480
for during the two weeks of its rosy denials.

17:22.480 --> 17:27.740
But when image and public relations confront reality, it's reality that will eventually

17:27.740 --> 17:28.740
win.

17:28.740 --> 17:33.820
I've always known this is a, this is a real, this is a pandemic.

17:33.820 --> 17:38.560
But there are worrying signs that the president still only wants to hear good news and even

17:38.560 --> 17:41.840
criticise the media for reporting bad news.

17:41.840 --> 17:45.600
One of his first actions after appointing Mike Pence's response team at the end of

17:45.600 --> 17:48.440
February was to muzzle health officials.

17:48.440 --> 17:53.000
Dr Fauci was told he had to get clearance through the vice president's office before

17:53.000 --> 17:54.840
talking to the media.

17:54.840 --> 17:59.200
I don't really care if I get in trouble for speaking to the media.

17:59.200 --> 18:04.920
I want people to know that this is bad.

18:04.920 --> 18:06.400
People are dying.

18:06.400 --> 18:11.160
We don't have the tools that we need in the emergency department and in the hospital to

18:11.160 --> 18:19.880
take care of them and, and it's really hard.

18:19.880 --> 18:24.000
The frustrating thing about all of this is it really just feels like it's too little,

18:24.000 --> 18:25.000
too late.

18:25.000 --> 18:28.720
Like we knew, we knew it was coming.

18:28.720 --> 18:32.200
What do you say to Americans who are watching you right now who are scared?

18:32.200 --> 18:34.200
I say that you're a terrible reporter.

18:34.200 --> 18:35.200
That's what I say.

18:35.200 --> 18:40.600
I think it's a very nasty question and I think it's a very bad signal that you're putting

18:40.600 --> 18:42.240
out to the American people.

18:42.240 --> 18:46.340
The American people are looking for answers and they're looking for hope.

18:46.340 --> 18:48.120
That's really bad reporting.

18:48.120 --> 18:53.240
No, the answer to that very sensible question should be, I want to reassure Americans who

18:53.240 --> 18:55.880
are scared that we'll get through this.

18:55.880 --> 18:59.120
You don't need to be scared, but you do need to be cautious.

18:59.120 --> 19:01.040
Follow the medical advice.

19:01.040 --> 19:06.200
If we do those things together as a nation, we'll get through this more safely and more

19:06.200 --> 19:07.200
quickly.

19:07.200 --> 19:11.800
In other words, you give people hope by being honest with them, not painting a false picture

19:11.800 --> 19:16.660
of the science and then blaming the press for not doing the same.

19:16.660 --> 19:21.240
Because science is about reality, it deals with the way things really are, not the way

19:21.240 --> 19:26.040
we wish they were or hope they'll be or think they ought to be.

19:26.040 --> 19:30.440
Reality doesn't change depending on your nationality or your religious, political or

19:30.440 --> 19:33.300
ideological position.

19:33.300 --> 19:37.320
When people are forced to choose between believing a politician they like and a scientist they

19:37.320 --> 19:42.320
don't know, they'll often go with the politician and reject the science.

19:42.320 --> 19:47.400
That's why only 40% of Republicans who trusted the President thought the worst was yet to

19:47.400 --> 19:51.240
come as opposed to 80% of Democrats.

19:51.240 --> 19:53.080
And here's the problem with that.

19:53.080 --> 19:57.320
When people believe their President's claim that the virus is no worse than the flu and

19:57.320 --> 20:02.320
it's already been stopped, and they see him shaking hands and holding rallies, they become

20:02.320 --> 20:03.440
complacent.

20:03.440 --> 20:06.600
They lose any concern about catching it or passing it on.

20:06.600 --> 20:08.240
If I get corona, I get corona.

20:08.240 --> 20:11.480
At the end of the day, I'm not going to let it stop me from partying.

20:11.480 --> 20:14.720
Fortunately, Fox News has recently changed its tone.

20:14.720 --> 20:17.580
It's a virus like the flu.

20:17.580 --> 20:19.960
It actually can be mistaken for the flu.

20:19.960 --> 20:24.560
We are facing an incredibly contagious and dangerous virus.

20:24.560 --> 20:27.620
Tens of thousands of people die from the flu.

20:27.620 --> 20:29.080
Every year people die from the flu.

20:29.080 --> 20:33.240
We're fighting an invisible enemy and now slowing the spread is crucial.

20:33.240 --> 20:34.240
It is key.

20:34.240 --> 20:39.800
No, the time to slow the spread of the virus was crucial and key as soon as the first case

20:39.800 --> 20:42.640
was detected in the United States.

20:42.640 --> 20:46.560
Comparisons are often made with South Korea because South Korea and the United States

20:46.560 --> 20:51.920
both had their first case of the virus on the same day, January 20th.

20:51.920 --> 20:56.040
The South Korean government didn't pretend it had contained the virus, didn't question

20:56.040 --> 21:01.240
the medical advice, and assumed that the number of infections wouldn't rise.

21:01.240 --> 21:02.900
It took action.

21:02.900 --> 21:05.940
Within two weeks it had begun mass testing.

21:05.940 --> 21:12.720
It followed WHO guidelines, tested people who were at risk, got test results quickly,

21:12.720 --> 21:17.000
quarantined them if they tested positive, tested people who came into contact with those

21:17.000 --> 21:22.160
who had tested positive, and then quarantined them if they tested positive.

21:22.160 --> 21:28.880
In just seven weeks the South Korean health authorities had tested 290,000 people without

21:28.880 --> 21:31.640
the need for a national lockdown.

21:31.640 --> 21:37.160
In the United States during the same period only 60,000 tests had been performed, even

21:37.160 --> 21:42.760
though the population is six times larger, and it took much longer to get test results.

21:42.760 --> 21:48.600
The idea of anybody getting it easily, the way people in other countries are doing it,

21:48.600 --> 21:50.180
we're not set up for that.

21:50.180 --> 21:51.440
Do I think we should be?

21:51.440 --> 21:53.360
Yes, but we're not.

21:53.360 --> 21:57.200
Nobody knew there'd be a pandemic or an epidemic of this proportion.

21:57.200 --> 21:59.540
Nobody's ever seen anything like this before.

21:59.540 --> 22:02.560
But of course that's not correct.

22:02.560 --> 22:07.460
Less than a year into his presidency, Foreign Affairs magazine warned that a pandemic could

22:07.460 --> 22:12.600
strike and that the Trump administration may be woefully unprepared.

22:12.600 --> 22:17.520
Three years into his presidency Trump should have read, or at least been briefed, about

22:17.520 --> 22:22.660
an intelligence report assessing worldwide threats, including the fact that the world

22:22.660 --> 22:28.360
was vulnerable to the next flu pandemic or large-scale outbreak of contagious disease

22:28.360 --> 22:32.460
that could lead to massive rates of death and disability.

22:32.460 --> 22:37.260
The previous administration set up a pandemic response team to prepare for just such an

22:37.260 --> 22:42.480
emergency but in 2018 the Trump administration disbanded it.

22:42.480 --> 22:47.140
The head of the response team, Timothy Zima, had to resign and members of the team were

22:47.140 --> 22:51.700
absorbed into other units within the National Security Council.

22:51.700 --> 22:56.700
Many experts warned that the move would leave the United States dangerously exposed to any

22:56.700 --> 22:57.700
pandemic.

22:57.700 --> 22:59.900
This isn't 20-20 hindsight.

22:59.900 --> 23:03.660
It was written two years before the current pandemic.

23:03.660 --> 23:08.200
The White House proposal is threatening to claw back funding whose precise purpose is

23:08.200 --> 23:13.820
to help the United States be able to respond quickly in the event of a crisis, said Carolyn

23:13.820 --> 23:18.900
Reynolds, a vice president at PATH, a global health technology non-profit.

23:18.900 --> 23:23.180
It seems to actively unlearn the lessons we learned through very hard experience over

23:23.180 --> 23:28.660
the last 15 years, said a senior policy fellow at the Center for Global Development.

23:28.660 --> 23:31.500
These moves make us materially less safe.

23:31.500 --> 23:33.500
It's inexplicable.

23:33.500 --> 23:36.100
So why did the Trump administration do it?

23:36.100 --> 23:38.740
Well, you'd have to ask the president.

23:38.740 --> 23:43.200
My first question is you said that you don't take responsibility, but you did disband the

23:43.200 --> 23:47.720
White House pandemic office and the officials that were working in that office left this

23:47.720 --> 23:49.180
administration abruptly.

23:49.180 --> 23:51.500
So what responsibility do you take to that?

23:51.500 --> 23:54.800
And the officials that worked in that office said that you, that the White House lost valuable

23:54.800 --> 23:57.380
time because that office was disbanded.

23:57.380 --> 23:58.380
What do you make of that?

23:58.380 --> 24:04.740
Well, I just think it's a nasty question because what we've done is, and Tony had said numerous

24:04.740 --> 24:09.660
times that we've saved thousands of lives because of the quick closing.

24:09.660 --> 24:11.400
And when you say me, I didn't do it.

24:11.400 --> 24:15.480
We have a group of people I could, I could ask perhaps the administration, but I could

24:15.480 --> 24:20.380
perhaps ask Tony about that because I don't know anything about it.

24:20.380 --> 24:26.240
As I said at the beginning, not every country has managed this crisis well, that's politics.

24:26.240 --> 24:30.300
And every country has had its share of McExperts, including my own.

24:30.300 --> 24:36.700
In spite of all the money spent on education, we revert to hysteria and alarmism.

24:36.700 --> 24:44.100
We now seem to be facing the health version of global warming, exaggeration in almost

24:44.100 --> 24:45.100
everything.

24:45.100 --> 24:49.180
The thing is most governments ignore these amateurs and prefer to go with professional

24:49.180 --> 24:53.100
scientific advice when it comes to issues of science.

24:53.100 --> 24:58.300
They'll inevitably be snafus and incompetence in response to any crisis.

24:58.300 --> 25:03.140
But what concerns me is that this is always compounded when leaders of countries don't

25:03.140 --> 25:09.180
accept scientific advice, downplay scientific reality and act on hunches and misinformed

25:09.180 --> 25:11.960
beliefs rather than science.

25:11.960 --> 25:15.540
That clearly has affected how the crisis is managed.

25:15.540 --> 25:20.340
A study from Oxford University found that while governments had varying delays in taking

25:20.340 --> 25:23.900
action, the US government delayed the longest.

25:23.900 --> 25:29.260
It waited until there were over 1,000 infections inside its borders before taking stringent

25:29.260 --> 25:31.300
measures against it.

25:31.300 --> 25:34.460
Only Britain came a close second.

25:34.460 --> 25:38.780
So this isn't a question of whether you support President Trump or you don't, whether you

25:38.780 --> 25:40.620
like him or loathe him.

25:40.620 --> 25:45.460
This is about scientific advice, taking precedence over political expediency.

25:45.460 --> 25:48.580
I hope that's something we should all be concerned about.
