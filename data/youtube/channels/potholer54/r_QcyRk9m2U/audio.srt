1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,000
Let's continue to examine two more scientific unknowables of the very first verse in the Bible.

2
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:14,000
In the beginning, God created the heavens and the earth.

3
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:15,000
Just a second.

4
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:21,000
In the very first verse of the Bible, we find a remarkable piece of evidence of supernatural authorship.

5
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:23,000
I'll be there in a minute. Don't start without me.

6
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:33,000
In the beginning, time, God created the heavens, space, and the earth, matter.

7
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:41,000
The Bible speaks of the creation of time, space, and matter in the very first verse.

8
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:46,000
Oh, it's okay, it's only P.P. Simmons waffling on about time, space, and matter, so I didn't miss anything.

9
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:51,000
What he's saying is that the Bible mentions time, space, and matter in the first verse,

10
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:56,000
so this must be, in his own words, remarkable evidence of supernatural authorship,

11
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:00,000
because we now know that the universe is made of time, space, and matter,

12
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:04,000
and how could Bronze Age people possibly have known about these three things?

13
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:08,000
My question is, is the opening verse in the Bible unique?

14
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:13,000
Are there other holy books that also prophesied time, space, and matter in the opening verse

15
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:16,000
as evidence of supernatural authorship?

16
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,000
Why, yes.

17
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:22,000
In Cinderella, for example, a story about magic and fairies,

18
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:27,000
it says the wife of a rich man felt her end was drawing near. That's time.

19
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:32,000
She called her daughter to her bedside. Both the daughter and the bed are made of matter.

20
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:35,000
And the verse refers to heaven, which, of course, is space.

21
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:39,000
A remarkable piece of evidence of supernatural authorship.

22
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:40,000
That's right, P.P.

23
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:44,000
Here's another supernatural opening verse from a story called The Wicked Prince.

24
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:48,000
Look, time, space, and matter.

25
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,000
A remarkable piece of evidence.

26
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:55,000
Yes, Hans Christian Andersen is clearly a god, and these stories prove the supernatural.

27
00:01:55,000 --> 00:02:01,000
Or maybe P.P. Simmons just doesn't get out much and doesn't read much outside the Bible.

28
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:07,000
But at least he can watch this video and see yet another example of supernatural authorship,

29
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:09,000
because in the very first verse we have time,

30
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:10,000
Just a second.

31
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:11,000
space,

32
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:12,000
I'll be there in a minute.

33
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:13,000
and matter.

34
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:19,000
Unfortunately, P.P. Simmons won't make the final ballot for this year's Golden Crocoduck,

35
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:21,000
because I have to void the nomination.

36
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:26,000
His belief that the Bible, or, if you like, fairy stories like Cinderella or The Wicked Prince,

37
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:30,000
are evidence of supernatural authorship is purely that, a belief.

38
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:35,000
And, of course, it's impossible to disprove that Hans Christian Andersen is a god.

39
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:41,000
Belief doesn't qualify because The Golden Crocoduck is about the misrepresentation of facts.

40
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:46,000
However, the next nominated video by YouTuber BT3701 does qualify.

41
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:53,000
He kindly provided a translation to this speech, in which Hitler apparently declared Darwinism the state religion.

42
00:02:58,000 --> 00:02:59,000
Hold on a second.

43
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:06,000
Sorry to be a Nazi Party pooper, but I think your grasp of German might not be up to the job of translating the FÃ¼hrer.

44
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,000
Let's just run that again.

45
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:19,000
Now, even I can tell that this doesn't mean we're a socialist nation, therefore we accept Darwinism.

46
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:26,000
Perhaps German scholars can correct me, but I'd translate this as we won't lie and we won't cheat.

47
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:29,000
And when I Googled this, I found the source.

48
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:35,000
The footage comes from Hitler's 1933 proclamation to the German nation soon after becoming Chancellor.

49
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:38,000
He didn't mention Darwin or natural selection at all.

50
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:41,000
The translation is completely fictitious.

51
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:46,000
The fact that the English translation is written with the spelling and grammar skills of a five-year-old

52
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:55,000
and that this is a creationist website should alert even creationists to the possibility that the channel operator is being economical with the truth.

53
00:03:55,000 --> 00:04:03,000
So who would be stupid enough not only to believe this mistranslation, but want to use it as evidence without checking it?

54
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:05,000
Well, this guy would.

55
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:11,000
This is perfect for my Hitler video, said a fan on BT 3701's video forum.

56
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:14,000
I'm going to link this video in the scroll down.

57
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,000
And indeed he did.

58
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:23,000
Here, under his own video about Hitler, he promoted BT 3701's spuriously translated video.

59
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:28,000
This video entitled Hitler Promotes Darwinism is a Real Mind Opener.

60
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:36,000
Hitler intended to exterminate believers in Christ, creationists too, and said so in the same speech on his video.

61
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:39,000
He did? Well, let's take a look.

62
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:43,000
When he'll dance, he's a torture point.

63
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:50,000
And for a film to iron our mind, to iron his life, iron his last night, iron his blood.

64
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:54,000
Yes, indeed, according to the translation, Hitler says he'll legislate law,

65
00:04:54,000 --> 00:05:00,000
I guess as an alternative to legislating something else, to exterminate less favoured people such as Jews,

66
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:06,000
along with all creationist, apostrophe S, and evangelical Christian, apostrophe S.

67
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:13,000
But what Hitler actually said is of course completely different to legislating law to exterminate Christians.

68
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:19,000
He's saying Germany will rise again through the hard work and commitment of the German people.

69
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:24,000
So who is this guy who was gullible enough to fall for this mistranslation

70
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:30,000
and promote it on his own YouTube channel as evidence that Hitler planned to exterminate creationists?

71
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:34,000
Oh no, it's MegaSage. Remember him?

72
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,000
Psalm 9610.

73
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,000
You're a scary man.

74
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:42,000
But MegaSage is already a candidate for the coveted Golden Crocoduck.

75
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:49,000
This nomination is for BT 3701 for not only lying to atheists about Hitler's hatred of creationists,

76
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:52,000
but also misleading his fellow creationists.

77
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:59,000
This is such a recipe for embarrassment that I wondered whether BT 3701 wasn't a closet atheist,

78
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:02,000
deliberately setting up gullible creationists for a fall.

79
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:04,000
So I messaged him to check.

80
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:12,000
BT 3701 assured me that he was a creationist and was quite happy to admit that he had lied in the translation.

81
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:14,000
In fact, he'd like an award for it.

82
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:21,000
BT's rationale is that the captions aren't a misrepresentation of Hitler's acceptance of Darwinism.

83
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:25,000
Well, yes they are BT, because they're made up.

84
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:30,000
Hitler accepted Darwin's theory of natural selection, he just didn't understand it.

85
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:35,000
He thought it meant survival of the strongest and was all about the strong crushing the weak.

86
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:43,000
In fact, human evolution was propelled by our ability to cooperate and our reliance on intelligence rather than brute strength.

87
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:49,000
But if you want to quote Hitler articulating the theory of natural selection, then why not quote him?

88
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:53,000
I mean his actual words rather than something you made up.

89
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:58,000
Otherwise you're misleading people who are prepared to believe you without bothering to check.

90
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:04,000
And you're doing no service to your own cause, because when someone like MegaSage regurgitates this crap,

91
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:08,000
he's going to be laughed at when someone points out that it is crap.

92
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:12,000
And even a paraphrase has to accurately reflect what someone says.

93
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:19,000
Now of course Hitler did kill Christians, but not because they were Christians, it was because they were opponents to his regime.

94
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:25,000
Making up an assertion by Hitler that he'll exterminate creationists and evangelical Christians

95
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:30,000
will lead the most gullible and the most stupid to believe that it's actually true.

96
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:34,000
And here's a post on BT 3701's video forum to prove it.

97
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:41,000
Someone who seems convinced that Hitler not only killed 6 million Jews, but also 6 million Catholics.

98
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:44,000
That's what happens when you start a Chinese whisper.

99
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:48,000
And did BT 3701 come clean and correct him?

100
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:51,000
No, he says, I totally agree.

101
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:58,000
I'm sure the comments section will be swamped with the usual irrelevant nonsense about whether Hitler was an atheist or a Christian.

102
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:05,000
But this isn't about Hitler's religion, it's about whether it's okay to make up quotes and to lie in support of your beliefs.

103
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:10,000
If you have to fake the evidence, then there's obviously something wrong with those beliefs.

104
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:14,000
So I'll leave the last word with the man who exemplifies this better than anyone,

105
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:21,000
who obviously blazed a trail for BT 3701, and who similarly showed pride in his own propaganda.

106
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:24,000
And this time, there's no mistranslation.
