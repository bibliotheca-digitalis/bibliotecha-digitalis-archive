0	10000	Let's continue to examine two more scientific unknowables of the very first verse in the Bible.
10000	14000	In the beginning, God created the heavens and the earth.
14000	15000	Just a second.
15000	21000	In the very first verse of the Bible, we find a remarkable piece of evidence of supernatural authorship.
21000	23000	I'll be there in a minute. Don't start without me.
23000	33000	In the beginning, time, God created the heavens, space, and the earth, matter.
33000	41000	The Bible speaks of the creation of time, space, and matter in the very first verse.
41000	46000	Oh, it's okay, it's only P.P. Simmons waffling on about time, space, and matter, so I didn't miss anything.
46000	51000	What he's saying is that the Bible mentions time, space, and matter in the first verse,
51000	56000	so this must be, in his own words, remarkable evidence of supernatural authorship,
56000	60000	because we now know that the universe is made of time, space, and matter,
60000	64000	and how could Bronze Age people possibly have known about these three things?
64000	68000	My question is, is the opening verse in the Bible unique?
68000	73000	Are there other holy books that also prophesied time, space, and matter in the opening verse
73000	76000	as evidence of supernatural authorship?
76000	78000	Why, yes.
78000	82000	In Cinderella, for example, a story about magic and fairies,
82000	87000	it says the wife of a rich man felt her end was drawing near. That's time.
87000	92000	She called her daughter to her bedside. Both the daughter and the bed are made of matter.
92000	95000	And the verse refers to heaven, which, of course, is space.
95000	99000	A remarkable piece of evidence of supernatural authorship.
99000	100000	That's right, P.P.
100000	104000	Here's another supernatural opening verse from a story called The Wicked Prince.
104000	108000	Look, time, space, and matter.
108000	110000	A remarkable piece of evidence.
110000	115000	Yes, Hans Christian Andersen is clearly a god, and these stories prove the supernatural.
115000	121000	Or maybe P.P. Simmons just doesn't get out much and doesn't read much outside the Bible.
121000	127000	But at least he can watch this video and see yet another example of supernatural authorship,
127000	129000	because in the very first verse we have time,
129000	130000	Just a second.
130000	131000	space,
131000	132000	I'll be there in a minute.
132000	133000	and matter.
134000	139000	Unfortunately, P.P. Simmons won't make the final ballot for this year's Golden Crocoduck,
139000	141000	because I have to void the nomination.
141000	146000	His belief that the Bible, or, if you like, fairy stories like Cinderella or The Wicked Prince,
146000	150000	are evidence of supernatural authorship is purely that, a belief.
150000	155000	And, of course, it's impossible to disprove that Hans Christian Andersen is a god.
155000	161000	Belief doesn't qualify because The Golden Crocoduck is about the misrepresentation of facts.
161000	166000	However, the next nominated video by YouTuber BT3701 does qualify.
166000	173000	He kindly provided a translation to this speech, in which Hitler apparently declared Darwinism the state religion.
178000	179000	Hold on a second.
179000	186000	Sorry to be a Nazi Party pooper, but I think your grasp of German might not be up to the job of translating the FÃ¼hrer.
186000	188000	Let's just run that again.
192000	199000	Now, even I can tell that this doesn't mean we're a socialist nation, therefore we accept Darwinism.
199000	206000	Perhaps German scholars can correct me, but I'd translate this as we won't lie and we won't cheat.
206000	209000	And when I Googled this, I found the source.
209000	215000	The footage comes from Hitler's 1933 proclamation to the German nation soon after becoming Chancellor.
215000	218000	He didn't mention Darwin or natural selection at all.
218000	221000	The translation is completely fictitious.
221000	226000	The fact that the English translation is written with the spelling and grammar skills of a five-year-old
226000	235000	and that this is a creationist website should alert even creationists to the possibility that the channel operator is being economical with the truth.
235000	243000	So who would be stupid enough not only to believe this mistranslation, but want to use it as evidence without checking it?
243000	245000	Well, this guy would.
246000	251000	This is perfect for my Hitler video, said a fan on BT 3701's video forum.
251000	254000	I'm going to link this video in the scroll down.
254000	256000	And indeed he did.
256000	263000	Here, under his own video about Hitler, he promoted BT 3701's spuriously translated video.
263000	268000	This video entitled Hitler Promotes Darwinism is a Real Mind Opener.
269000	276000	Hitler intended to exterminate believers in Christ, creationists too, and said so in the same speech on his video.
276000	279000	He did? Well, let's take a look.
279000	283000	When he'll dance, he's a torture point.
283000	290000	And for a film to iron our mind, to iron his life, iron his last night, iron his blood.
290000	294000	Yes, indeed, according to the translation, Hitler says he'll legislate law,
294000	300000	I guess as an alternative to legislating something else, to exterminate less favoured people such as Jews,
300000	306000	along with all creationist, apostrophe S, and evangelical Christian, apostrophe S.
306000	313000	But what Hitler actually said is of course completely different to legislating law to exterminate Christians.
313000	319000	He's saying Germany will rise again through the hard work and commitment of the German people.
319000	324000	So who is this guy who was gullible enough to fall for this mistranslation
324000	330000	and promote it on his own YouTube channel as evidence that Hitler planned to exterminate creationists?
330000	334000	Oh no, it's MegaSage. Remember him?
334000	336000	Psalm 9610.
336000	338000	You're a scary man.
338000	342000	But MegaSage is already a candidate for the coveted Golden Crocoduck.
342000	349000	This nomination is for BT 3701 for not only lying to atheists about Hitler's hatred of creationists,
349000	352000	but also misleading his fellow creationists.
352000	359000	This is such a recipe for embarrassment that I wondered whether BT 3701 wasn't a closet atheist,
359000	362000	deliberately setting up gullible creationists for a fall.
362000	364000	So I messaged him to check.
364000	372000	BT 3701 assured me that he was a creationist and was quite happy to admit that he had lied in the translation.
372000	374000	In fact, he'd like an award for it.
374000	381000	BT's rationale is that the captions aren't a misrepresentation of Hitler's acceptance of Darwinism.
381000	385000	Well, yes they are BT, because they're made up.
385000	390000	Hitler accepted Darwin's theory of natural selection, he just didn't understand it.
390000	395000	He thought it meant survival of the strongest and was all about the strong crushing the weak.
395000	403000	In fact, human evolution was propelled by our ability to cooperate and our reliance on intelligence rather than brute strength.
403000	409000	But if you want to quote Hitler articulating the theory of natural selection, then why not quote him?
409000	413000	I mean his actual words rather than something you made up.
413000	418000	Otherwise you're misleading people who are prepared to believe you without bothering to check.
418000	424000	And you're doing no service to your own cause, because when someone like MegaSage regurgitates this crap,
424000	428000	he's going to be laughed at when someone points out that it is crap.
428000	432000	And even a paraphrase has to accurately reflect what someone says.
432000	439000	Now of course Hitler did kill Christians, but not because they were Christians, it was because they were opponents to his regime.
439000	445000	Making up an assertion by Hitler that he'll exterminate creationists and evangelical Christians
445000	450000	will lead the most gullible and the most stupid to believe that it's actually true.
450000	454000	And here's a post on BT 3701's video forum to prove it.
454000	461000	Someone who seems convinced that Hitler not only killed 6 million Jews, but also 6 million Catholics.
461000	464000	That's what happens when you start a Chinese whisper.
464000	468000	And did BT 3701 come clean and correct him?
468000	471000	No, he says, I totally agree.
471000	478000	I'm sure the comments section will be swamped with the usual irrelevant nonsense about whether Hitler was an atheist or a Christian.
478000	485000	But this isn't about Hitler's religion, it's about whether it's okay to make up quotes and to lie in support of your beliefs.
485000	490000	If you have to fake the evidence, then there's obviously something wrong with those beliefs.
490000	494000	So I'll leave the last word with the man who exemplifies this better than anyone,
494000	501000	who obviously blazed a trail for BT 3701, and who similarly showed pride in his own propaganda.
501000	504000	And this time, there's no mistranslation.
