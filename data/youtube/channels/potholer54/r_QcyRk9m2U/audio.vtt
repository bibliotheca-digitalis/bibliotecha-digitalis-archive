00:00.000 --> 00:10.000
Let's continue to examine two more scientific unknowables of the very first verse in the Bible.

00:10.000 --> 00:14.000
In the beginning, God created the heavens and the earth.

00:14.000 --> 00:15.000
Just a second.

00:15.000 --> 00:21.000
In the very first verse of the Bible, we find a remarkable piece of evidence of supernatural authorship.

00:21.000 --> 00:23.000
I'll be there in a minute. Don't start without me.

00:23.000 --> 00:33.000
In the beginning, time, God created the heavens, space, and the earth, matter.

00:33.000 --> 00:41.000
The Bible speaks of the creation of time, space, and matter in the very first verse.

00:41.000 --> 00:46.000
Oh, it's okay, it's only P.P. Simmons waffling on about time, space, and matter, so I didn't miss anything.

00:46.000 --> 00:51.000
What he's saying is that the Bible mentions time, space, and matter in the first verse,

00:51.000 --> 00:56.000
so this must be, in his own words, remarkable evidence of supernatural authorship,

00:56.000 --> 01:00.000
because we now know that the universe is made of time, space, and matter,

01:00.000 --> 01:04.000
and how could Bronze Age people possibly have known about these three things?

01:04.000 --> 01:08.000
My question is, is the opening verse in the Bible unique?

01:08.000 --> 01:13.000
Are there other holy books that also prophesied time, space, and matter in the opening verse

01:13.000 --> 01:16.000
as evidence of supernatural authorship?

01:16.000 --> 01:18.000
Why, yes.

01:18.000 --> 01:22.000
In Cinderella, for example, a story about magic and fairies,

01:22.000 --> 01:27.000
it says the wife of a rich man felt her end was drawing near. That's time.

01:27.000 --> 01:32.000
She called her daughter to her bedside. Both the daughter and the bed are made of matter.

01:32.000 --> 01:35.000
And the verse refers to heaven, which, of course, is space.

01:35.000 --> 01:39.000
A remarkable piece of evidence of supernatural authorship.

01:39.000 --> 01:40.000
That's right, P.P.

01:40.000 --> 01:44.000
Here's another supernatural opening verse from a story called The Wicked Prince.

01:44.000 --> 01:48.000
Look, time, space, and matter.

01:48.000 --> 01:50.000
A remarkable piece of evidence.

01:50.000 --> 01:55.000
Yes, Hans Christian Andersen is clearly a god, and these stories prove the supernatural.

01:55.000 --> 02:01.000
Or maybe P.P. Simmons just doesn't get out much and doesn't read much outside the Bible.

02:01.000 --> 02:07.000
But at least he can watch this video and see yet another example of supernatural authorship,

02:07.000 --> 02:09.000
because in the very first verse we have time,

02:09.000 --> 02:10.000
Just a second.

02:10.000 --> 02:11.000
space,

02:11.000 --> 02:12.000
I'll be there in a minute.

02:12.000 --> 02:13.000
and matter.

02:14.000 --> 02:19.000
Unfortunately, P.P. Simmons won't make the final ballot for this year's Golden Crocoduck,

02:19.000 --> 02:21.000
because I have to void the nomination.

02:21.000 --> 02:26.000
His belief that the Bible, or, if you like, fairy stories like Cinderella or The Wicked Prince,

02:26.000 --> 02:30.000
are evidence of supernatural authorship is purely that, a belief.

02:30.000 --> 02:35.000
And, of course, it's impossible to disprove that Hans Christian Andersen is a god.

02:35.000 --> 02:41.000
Belief doesn't qualify because The Golden Crocoduck is about the misrepresentation of facts.

02:41.000 --> 02:46.000
However, the next nominated video by YouTuber BT3701 does qualify.

02:46.000 --> 02:53.000
He kindly provided a translation to this speech, in which Hitler apparently declared Darwinism the state religion.

02:58.000 --> 02:59.000
Hold on a second.

02:59.000 --> 03:06.000
Sorry to be a Nazi Party pooper, but I think your grasp of German might not be up to the job of translating the FÃ¼hrer.

03:06.000 --> 03:08.000
Let's just run that again.

03:12.000 --> 03:19.000
Now, even I can tell that this doesn't mean we're a socialist nation, therefore we accept Darwinism.

03:19.000 --> 03:26.000
Perhaps German scholars can correct me, but I'd translate this as we won't lie and we won't cheat.

03:26.000 --> 03:29.000
And when I Googled this, I found the source.

03:29.000 --> 03:35.000
The footage comes from Hitler's 1933 proclamation to the German nation soon after becoming Chancellor.

03:35.000 --> 03:38.000
He didn't mention Darwin or natural selection at all.

03:38.000 --> 03:41.000
The translation is completely fictitious.

03:41.000 --> 03:46.000
The fact that the English translation is written with the spelling and grammar skills of a five-year-old

03:46.000 --> 03:55.000
and that this is a creationist website should alert even creationists to the possibility that the channel operator is being economical with the truth.

03:55.000 --> 04:03.000
So who would be stupid enough not only to believe this mistranslation, but want to use it as evidence without checking it?

04:03.000 --> 04:05.000
Well, this guy would.

04:06.000 --> 04:11.000
This is perfect for my Hitler video, said a fan on BT 3701's video forum.

04:11.000 --> 04:14.000
I'm going to link this video in the scroll down.

04:14.000 --> 04:16.000
And indeed he did.

04:16.000 --> 04:23.000
Here, under his own video about Hitler, he promoted BT 3701's spuriously translated video.

04:23.000 --> 04:28.000
This video entitled Hitler Promotes Darwinism is a Real Mind Opener.

04:29.000 --> 04:36.000
Hitler intended to exterminate believers in Christ, creationists too, and said so in the same speech on his video.

04:36.000 --> 04:39.000
He did? Well, let's take a look.

04:39.000 --> 04:43.000
When he'll dance, he's a torture point.

04:43.000 --> 04:50.000
And for a film to iron our mind, to iron his life, iron his last night, iron his blood.

04:50.000 --> 04:54.000
Yes, indeed, according to the translation, Hitler says he'll legislate law,

04:54.000 --> 05:00.000
I guess as an alternative to legislating something else, to exterminate less favoured people such as Jews,

05:00.000 --> 05:06.000
along with all creationist, apostrophe S, and evangelical Christian, apostrophe S.

05:06.000 --> 05:13.000
But what Hitler actually said is of course completely different to legislating law to exterminate Christians.

05:13.000 --> 05:19.000
He's saying Germany will rise again through the hard work and commitment of the German people.

05:19.000 --> 05:24.000
So who is this guy who was gullible enough to fall for this mistranslation

05:24.000 --> 05:30.000
and promote it on his own YouTube channel as evidence that Hitler planned to exterminate creationists?

05:30.000 --> 05:34.000
Oh no, it's MegaSage. Remember him?

05:34.000 --> 05:36.000
Psalm 9610.

05:36.000 --> 05:38.000
You're a scary man.

05:38.000 --> 05:42.000
But MegaSage is already a candidate for the coveted Golden Crocoduck.

05:42.000 --> 05:49.000
This nomination is for BT 3701 for not only lying to atheists about Hitler's hatred of creationists,

05:49.000 --> 05:52.000
but also misleading his fellow creationists.

05:52.000 --> 05:59.000
This is such a recipe for embarrassment that I wondered whether BT 3701 wasn't a closet atheist,

05:59.000 --> 06:02.000
deliberately setting up gullible creationists for a fall.

06:02.000 --> 06:04.000
So I messaged him to check.

06:04.000 --> 06:12.000
BT 3701 assured me that he was a creationist and was quite happy to admit that he had lied in the translation.

06:12.000 --> 06:14.000
In fact, he'd like an award for it.

06:14.000 --> 06:21.000
BT's rationale is that the captions aren't a misrepresentation of Hitler's acceptance of Darwinism.

06:21.000 --> 06:25.000
Well, yes they are BT, because they're made up.

06:25.000 --> 06:30.000
Hitler accepted Darwin's theory of natural selection, he just didn't understand it.

06:30.000 --> 06:35.000
He thought it meant survival of the strongest and was all about the strong crushing the weak.

06:35.000 --> 06:43.000
In fact, human evolution was propelled by our ability to cooperate and our reliance on intelligence rather than brute strength.

06:43.000 --> 06:49.000
But if you want to quote Hitler articulating the theory of natural selection, then why not quote him?

06:49.000 --> 06:53.000
I mean his actual words rather than something you made up.

06:53.000 --> 06:58.000
Otherwise you're misleading people who are prepared to believe you without bothering to check.

06:58.000 --> 07:04.000
And you're doing no service to your own cause, because when someone like MegaSage regurgitates this crap,

07:04.000 --> 07:08.000
he's going to be laughed at when someone points out that it is crap.

07:08.000 --> 07:12.000
And even a paraphrase has to accurately reflect what someone says.

07:12.000 --> 07:19.000
Now of course Hitler did kill Christians, but not because they were Christians, it was because they were opponents to his regime.

07:19.000 --> 07:25.000
Making up an assertion by Hitler that he'll exterminate creationists and evangelical Christians

07:25.000 --> 07:30.000
will lead the most gullible and the most stupid to believe that it's actually true.

07:30.000 --> 07:34.000
And here's a post on BT 3701's video forum to prove it.

07:34.000 --> 07:41.000
Someone who seems convinced that Hitler not only killed 6 million Jews, but also 6 million Catholics.

07:41.000 --> 07:44.000
That's what happens when you start a Chinese whisper.

07:44.000 --> 07:48.000
And did BT 3701 come clean and correct him?

07:48.000 --> 07:51.000
No, he says, I totally agree.

07:51.000 --> 07:58.000
I'm sure the comments section will be swamped with the usual irrelevant nonsense about whether Hitler was an atheist or a Christian.

07:58.000 --> 08:05.000
But this isn't about Hitler's religion, it's about whether it's okay to make up quotes and to lie in support of your beliefs.

08:05.000 --> 08:10.000
If you have to fake the evidence, then there's obviously something wrong with those beliefs.

08:10.000 --> 08:14.000
So I'll leave the last word with the man who exemplifies this better than anyone,

08:14.000 --> 08:21.000
who obviously blazed a trail for BT 3701, and who similarly showed pride in his own propaganda.

08:21.000 --> 08:24.000
And this time, there's no mistranslation.
