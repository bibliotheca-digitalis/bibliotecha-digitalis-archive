00:00.000 --> 00:13.780
Hello, and welcome.

00:13.780 --> 00:19.160
This channel is part of the fight back against junk science that's now pervading the internet.

00:19.160 --> 00:27.560
If you want to know whether some of the scientific claims you see in blogs and videos are true,

00:27.560 --> 00:31.660
and you're interested in knowing what the real science says, this might be the channel

00:31.660 --> 00:33.080
for you.

00:33.080 --> 00:34.600
My name's Peter Hadfield.

00:34.600 --> 00:39.580
I'm a former geologist who became a professional science journalist back in the days before

00:39.580 --> 00:45.840
the internet, so I do my research the old-fashioned way, I track down where the bloggers and video

00:45.840 --> 00:51.260
makers got their information from, and then show how they changed, misunderstood, or even

00:51.260 --> 00:54.000
deliberately misrepresented it.

00:54.000 --> 00:55.760
But why don't I show you an example?

00:55.760 --> 01:00.240
Here's a snippet debunking an episode of the TV programme Conspiracy Theory.

01:00.240 --> 01:04.200
The top secret government project that can destroy the world.

01:04.200 --> 01:08.880
Here's Jesse Ventura investigating Harp's triggering of the Boxing Day tsunami that

01:08.880 --> 01:11.280
hit large parts of South East Asia.

01:11.280 --> 01:15.800
This photo was actually taken just before the big tsunami hit the coast of Indonesia.

01:15.800 --> 01:19.040
So how do we know it was taken just before the tsunami?

01:19.040 --> 01:23.600
It meant taking the Conspiracy Show logo off the bottom of the photo and doing a search

01:23.600 --> 01:25.700
for it on Google Images.

01:25.700 --> 01:31.720
And presto, I discovered exactly the same photo on sale for $24 at Dave Miller's Posters

01:31.720 --> 01:33.760
Wanted website.

01:33.760 --> 01:38.240
Not only is there no indication that this commercial picture was taken before, or even

01:38.240 --> 01:42.280
in the same decade as the tsunami, it's not even in the same hemisphere.

01:42.280 --> 01:47.960
It is advertised as the Aurora Australis, the Southern Lights.

01:47.960 --> 01:53.000
And after busting the myths in TV shows, blogs, videos and newspapers, I show what the real

01:53.000 --> 01:54.600
science says.

01:54.600 --> 01:55.960
Not my theories.

01:55.960 --> 01:59.600
That would make me no better than all the MOOC experts on the internet.

01:59.600 --> 02:03.840
I'm talking about the science that's taught to the next generation of scientists that

02:03.840 --> 02:06.640
comes from the scientific literature.

02:06.640 --> 02:11.520
And I promise it's not hard to follow, even if you dropped out of science in high school.

02:11.520 --> 02:15.360
You'll be able to see right through some of the tricks the media try to pull.

02:15.360 --> 02:17.560
Here are three more clips from my videos.

02:17.560 --> 02:23.040
Because if GMOs really are the cause of cancer, brain damage, metabolic collapse, and what

02:23.040 --> 02:24.040
else?

02:24.040 --> 02:27.760
Yeah, right.

02:27.760 --> 02:32.200
Then that ought to show up among the billions of people and animals who've been consuming

02:32.200 --> 02:37.320
it over the last 20 to 30 years, compared to those who haven't.

02:37.320 --> 02:40.800
The studies that have been done have all drawn a blank.

02:40.800 --> 02:42.800
So let's try the opposite tack.

02:42.800 --> 02:45.520
This is a dinosaur bone, by the way, it's been replaced by minerals.

02:45.520 --> 02:50.760
Whoa, hold on, before you get to the but, did I just hear you say, it's been replaced

02:50.760 --> 02:51.760
by minerals?

02:51.760 --> 02:54.520
So in fact, there's no carbon in it.

02:54.520 --> 02:58.600
And this would seem to be rather a crucial requirement if you want to perform carbon

02:58.600 --> 02:59.600
dating.

02:59.600 --> 03:03.160
If I took this to a laboratory and said, would you please date this, they would say, oh well,

03:03.160 --> 03:06.240
we'd have to use something other than carbon dating, because this is too old for carbon

03:06.240 --> 03:07.240
dating.

03:07.240 --> 03:08.240
No, Ken, they wouldn't.

03:08.240 --> 03:10.280
They'd say, Oi, haven't!

03:10.280 --> 03:11.760
We can't carbon date this!

03:11.800 --> 03:14.000
There's no f***ing carbon in it!

03:14.000 --> 03:18.760
Let's take the graph on the left first, which narrator Warren Meyer says comes from Moberg's

03:18.760 --> 03:21.240
2005 study.

03:21.240 --> 03:25.760
If we look at Moberg's original, we can see that the instrumental temperature data showing

03:25.760 --> 03:29.360
late 20th century warming has been erased.

03:29.360 --> 03:34.160
Worse than that, Moberg's proxy data, that he says in the caption goes back as far as

03:34.160 --> 03:39.720
1979, is extended to make it look as though it goes up to the year 2000.

03:39.720 --> 03:42.120
The scale's been changed.

03:42.120 --> 03:46.400
You can see that more clearly when I match the two graphs up.

03:46.400 --> 03:50.640
Notice how the doctored graph ends short of the recent period of warming, but the date

03:50.640 --> 03:53.960
has been changed to 2000.

03:53.960 --> 03:58.920
So in the doctored graph, 30 years of warming is simply airbrushed out, and the scale...

03:58.920 --> 04:02.200
And if you dispute something, I've said, hey, no problem.

04:02.200 --> 04:08.000
I list all my sources in the video descriptions, whether it's the source of whatever I'm critiquing,

04:08.000 --> 04:12.920
so you can be sure I haven't set up a straw man, or whether it's a list of my scientific

04:12.920 --> 04:17.620
sources so that you can check I'm reporting the science accurately.

04:17.620 --> 04:23.480
And if anyone does find a mistake, however small, I'm always happy to issue a correction.

04:23.480 --> 04:25.520
Citing sources and correcting errors?

04:25.520 --> 04:26.520
On YouTube?

04:26.520 --> 04:28.840
Yes, it can be done.

04:28.840 --> 04:33.520
And if you can't find any errors, well, just let off steam by telling me I'm a dickhead.

04:33.520 --> 04:35.700
You'll feel so much better.

04:35.900 --> 04:40.340
Another thing I try to do is show people how to be sceptical, and check stuff they read

04:40.340 --> 04:44.480
on the internet, because a lot of people ask me how it's done.

04:44.480 --> 04:48.840
From how to tell the difference between a reputable scientific journal and a junk one,

04:48.840 --> 04:51.820
to the basics of tracking down sources.

04:51.820 --> 04:53.500
Here are a few examples.

04:53.500 --> 04:57.160
That's close to a 10% difference, which is not much.

04:57.160 --> 05:01.900
So as always, we have to ask, where do Lomborg's figures come from?

05:01.900 --> 05:03.880
PragerU doesn't tell us.

05:03.880 --> 05:07.120
So I emailed Lomborg to ask him.

05:07.120 --> 05:12.760
His office told me his source is this paper by Hawkins et al, and right up top the abstract

05:12.760 --> 05:20.380
shows not a 10% difference, as Lomborg says, but a range from 10% to 24%.

05:20.380 --> 05:25.400
The authors later issued a corrigendum, and that figure was corrected to between 17 and

05:25.400 --> 05:29.360
30%, which is even further from Lomborg's claim.

05:29.360 --> 05:33.740
The first thing that comes to mind is that Lomborg cherry-picked the figures, but I can't

05:33.740 --> 05:36.020
say that without reading the study.

05:36.020 --> 05:40.860
OK, I've read the study, and yep, he cherry-picked the figures.

05:40.860 --> 05:45.760
The Mail doesn't even cite its source, but it does give a keyword and a date, so it's

05:45.760 --> 05:51.920
not hard to search Google Scholar for the word Roynemur and find the relevant paper.

05:51.920 --> 05:56.180
And it's quickly apparent that it doesn't say the Maldives will become uninhabitable

05:56.180 --> 05:58.540
by 2030 at all.

05:58.540 --> 06:00.980
So here are a few warning signs.

06:01.220 --> 06:06.700
First, be wary of anyone who feels the need to dress up in order to impart scientific

06:06.700 --> 06:11.020
information, especially when his lab coat looks like it's never been used.

06:11.020 --> 06:12.300
I'm part of a group of doctors.

06:12.300 --> 06:17.020
Second, be wary of someone who says he's part of a group of doctors, when in fact he's

06:17.020 --> 06:18.020
a chiropractor.

06:18.020 --> 06:21.340
Better out bringing the truth about genetically modified foods.

06:21.340 --> 06:25.820
Thirdly, never trust anyone who tells you he's speaking the truth.

06:25.820 --> 06:28.900
Science depends on evidence that's consistent with a hypothesis.

06:28.900 --> 06:31.660
And the harmful effects that it has on our health.

06:31.660 --> 06:34.420
And fourth, check the information.

06:34.420 --> 06:39.780
The problem seems to be that Tony's only reading the abstract of the study on a NASA website.

06:39.780 --> 06:45.140
He needs to read the paper itself, where the source of his misunderstanding is revealed.

06:45.140 --> 06:51.600
In the paper itself, the authors show that ozone depletion and greenhouse gases exacerbated

06:51.600 --> 06:55.700
a phenomenon called the Southern Annular Mode, or the SAM.

06:55.700 --> 07:00.820
My conclusion was that recent cooling over the Antarctic continental interior has likely

07:00.820 --> 07:05.420
been caused by both ozone depletion and greenhouse gas increases.

07:05.420 --> 07:09.660
And having worked in television for three decades, I teach some of the media tricks

07:09.660 --> 07:14.680
that less reputable video makers use to pull the wool over your eyes, so that you can watch

07:14.680 --> 07:15.680
out for them.

07:15.680 --> 07:18.340
Well then how did it get created?

07:18.340 --> 07:22.300
Well, um, by a very slow process.

07:22.300 --> 07:23.300
Well how did it start?

07:23.300 --> 07:25.460
Nobody knows how it started.

07:25.460 --> 07:27.580
We know the kind of event that it must have been.

07:27.580 --> 07:31.180
We know the sort of event that must have happened for the origin of life.

07:31.180 --> 07:36.780
Four very obvious cuts in both the audio and the video, in the space of just a few seconds.

07:36.780 --> 07:41.420
Taking us from a question about the origin of the universe, to an answer about the origin

07:41.420 --> 07:42.420
of life.

07:42.420 --> 07:47.340
Finally, it doesn't matter which side of the political spectrum anyone's on, or which god

07:47.340 --> 07:50.540
you believe in, science doesn't distinguish.

07:50.540 --> 07:51.540
And neither do I.

07:52.540 --> 07:59.280
Evolution is the way things change over time, over a billion years or more.

07:59.280 --> 08:03.980
In his film An Inconvenient Truth, Al Gore used a graph like this to show a correlation

08:03.980 --> 08:08.020
between carbon dioxide levels and increased temperatures.

08:08.020 --> 08:12.420
But he obscured the fact that the carbon dioxide increases lag the temperature increases.

08:12.420 --> 08:17.580
I'm happy to debunk any myth, whoever makes it, because the laws of science are politically

08:17.580 --> 08:18.580
neutral.

08:18.620 --> 08:23.020
Now, I don't ask for donations and my channel isn't monetised.

08:23.020 --> 08:27.380
If you really feel bad about watching these well researched videos for free, or if you

08:27.380 --> 08:32.080
don't want to accept scientific conclusions and think I'm a human deformation, you can

08:32.080 --> 08:37.180
donate to a charity that I really like, and that I hope we can all support, detailed in

08:37.180 --> 08:39.740
the more recent video descriptions.

08:39.740 --> 08:40.540
Thanks for watching.
