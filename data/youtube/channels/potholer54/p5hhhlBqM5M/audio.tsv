0	13780	Hello, and welcome.
13780	19160	This channel is part of the fight back against junk science that's now pervading the internet.
19160	27560	If you want to know whether some of the scientific claims you see in blogs and videos are true,
27560	31660	and you're interested in knowing what the real science says, this might be the channel
31660	33080	for you.
33080	34600	My name's Peter Hadfield.
34600	39580	I'm a former geologist who became a professional science journalist back in the days before
39580	45840	the internet, so I do my research the old-fashioned way, I track down where the bloggers and video
45840	51260	makers got their information from, and then show how they changed, misunderstood, or even
51260	54000	deliberately misrepresented it.
54000	55760	But why don't I show you an example?
55760	60240	Here's a snippet debunking an episode of the TV programme Conspiracy Theory.
60240	64200	The top secret government project that can destroy the world.
64200	68880	Here's Jesse Ventura investigating Harp's triggering of the Boxing Day tsunami that
68880	71280	hit large parts of South East Asia.
71280	75800	This photo was actually taken just before the big tsunami hit the coast of Indonesia.
75800	79040	So how do we know it was taken just before the tsunami?
79040	83600	It meant taking the Conspiracy Show logo off the bottom of the photo and doing a search
83600	85700	for it on Google Images.
85700	91720	And presto, I discovered exactly the same photo on sale for $24 at Dave Miller's Posters
91720	93760	Wanted website.
93760	98240	Not only is there no indication that this commercial picture was taken before, or even
98240	102280	in the same decade as the tsunami, it's not even in the same hemisphere.
102280	107960	It is advertised as the Aurora Australis, the Southern Lights.
107960	113000	And after busting the myths in TV shows, blogs, videos and newspapers, I show what the real
113000	114600	science says.
114600	115960	Not my theories.
115960	119600	That would make me no better than all the MOOC experts on the internet.
119600	123840	I'm talking about the science that's taught to the next generation of scientists that
123840	126640	comes from the scientific literature.
126640	131520	And I promise it's not hard to follow, even if you dropped out of science in high school.
131520	135360	You'll be able to see right through some of the tricks the media try to pull.
135360	137560	Here are three more clips from my videos.
137560	143040	Because if GMOs really are the cause of cancer, brain damage, metabolic collapse, and what
143040	144040	else?
144040	147760	Yeah, right.
147760	152200	Then that ought to show up among the billions of people and animals who've been consuming
152200	157320	it over the last 20 to 30 years, compared to those who haven't.
157320	160800	The studies that have been done have all drawn a blank.
160800	162800	So let's try the opposite tack.
162800	165520	This is a dinosaur bone, by the way, it's been replaced by minerals.
165520	170760	Whoa, hold on, before you get to the but, did I just hear you say, it's been replaced
170760	171760	by minerals?
171760	174520	So in fact, there's no carbon in it.
174520	178600	And this would seem to be rather a crucial requirement if you want to perform carbon
178600	179600	dating.
179600	183160	If I took this to a laboratory and said, would you please date this, they would say, oh well,
183160	186240	we'd have to use something other than carbon dating, because this is too old for carbon
186240	187240	dating.
187240	188240	No, Ken, they wouldn't.
188240	190280	They'd say, Oi, haven't!
190280	191760	We can't carbon date this!
191800	194000	There's no f***ing carbon in it!
194000	198760	Let's take the graph on the left first, which narrator Warren Meyer says comes from Moberg's
198760	201240	2005 study.
201240	205760	If we look at Moberg's original, we can see that the instrumental temperature data showing
205760	209360	late 20th century warming has been erased.
209360	214160	Worse than that, Moberg's proxy data, that he says in the caption goes back as far as
214160	219720	1979, is extended to make it look as though it goes up to the year 2000.
219720	222120	The scale's been changed.
222120	226400	You can see that more clearly when I match the two graphs up.
226400	230640	Notice how the doctored graph ends short of the recent period of warming, but the date
230640	233960	has been changed to 2000.
233960	238920	So in the doctored graph, 30 years of warming is simply airbrushed out, and the scale...
238920	242200	And if you dispute something, I've said, hey, no problem.
242200	248000	I list all my sources in the video descriptions, whether it's the source of whatever I'm critiquing,
248000	252920	so you can be sure I haven't set up a straw man, or whether it's a list of my scientific
252920	257620	sources so that you can check I'm reporting the science accurately.
257620	263480	And if anyone does find a mistake, however small, I'm always happy to issue a correction.
263480	265520	Citing sources and correcting errors?
265520	266520	On YouTube?
266520	268840	Yes, it can be done.
268840	273520	And if you can't find any errors, well, just let off steam by telling me I'm a dickhead.
273520	275700	You'll feel so much better.
275900	280340	Another thing I try to do is show people how to be sceptical, and check stuff they read
280340	284480	on the internet, because a lot of people ask me how it's done.
284480	288840	From how to tell the difference between a reputable scientific journal and a junk one,
288840	291820	to the basics of tracking down sources.
291820	293500	Here are a few examples.
293500	297160	That's close to a 10% difference, which is not much.
297160	301900	So as always, we have to ask, where do Lomborg's figures come from?
301900	303880	PragerU doesn't tell us.
303880	307120	So I emailed Lomborg to ask him.
307120	312760	His office told me his source is this paper by Hawkins et al, and right up top the abstract
312760	320380	shows not a 10% difference, as Lomborg says, but a range from 10% to 24%.
320380	325400	The authors later issued a corrigendum, and that figure was corrected to between 17 and
325400	329360	30%, which is even further from Lomborg's claim.
329360	333740	The first thing that comes to mind is that Lomborg cherry-picked the figures, but I can't
333740	336020	say that without reading the study.
336020	340860	OK, I've read the study, and yep, he cherry-picked the figures.
340860	345760	The Mail doesn't even cite its source, but it does give a keyword and a date, so it's
345760	351920	not hard to search Google Scholar for the word Roynemur and find the relevant paper.
351920	356180	And it's quickly apparent that it doesn't say the Maldives will become uninhabitable
356180	358540	by 2030 at all.
358540	360980	So here are a few warning signs.
361220	366700	First, be wary of anyone who feels the need to dress up in order to impart scientific
366700	371020	information, especially when his lab coat looks like it's never been used.
371020	372300	I'm part of a group of doctors.
372300	377020	Second, be wary of someone who says he's part of a group of doctors, when in fact he's
377020	378020	a chiropractor.
378020	381340	Better out bringing the truth about genetically modified foods.
381340	385820	Thirdly, never trust anyone who tells you he's speaking the truth.
385820	388900	Science depends on evidence that's consistent with a hypothesis.
388900	391660	And the harmful effects that it has on our health.
391660	394420	And fourth, check the information.
394420	399780	The problem seems to be that Tony's only reading the abstract of the study on a NASA website.
399780	405140	He needs to read the paper itself, where the source of his misunderstanding is revealed.
405140	411600	In the paper itself, the authors show that ozone depletion and greenhouse gases exacerbated
411600	415700	a phenomenon called the Southern Annular Mode, or the SAM.
415700	420820	My conclusion was that recent cooling over the Antarctic continental interior has likely
420820	425420	been caused by both ozone depletion and greenhouse gas increases.
425420	429660	And having worked in television for three decades, I teach some of the media tricks
429660	434680	that less reputable video makers use to pull the wool over your eyes, so that you can watch
434680	435680	out for them.
435680	438340	Well then how did it get created?
438340	442300	Well, um, by a very slow process.
442300	443300	Well how did it start?
443300	445460	Nobody knows how it started.
445460	447580	We know the kind of event that it must have been.
447580	451180	We know the sort of event that must have happened for the origin of life.
451180	456780	Four very obvious cuts in both the audio and the video, in the space of just a few seconds.
456780	461420	Taking us from a question about the origin of the universe, to an answer about the origin
461420	462420	of life.
462420	467340	Finally, it doesn't matter which side of the political spectrum anyone's on, or which god
467340	470540	you believe in, science doesn't distinguish.
470540	471540	And neither do I.
472540	479280	Evolution is the way things change over time, over a billion years or more.
479280	483980	In his film An Inconvenient Truth, Al Gore used a graph like this to show a correlation
483980	488020	between carbon dioxide levels and increased temperatures.
488020	492420	But he obscured the fact that the carbon dioxide increases lag the temperature increases.
492420	497580	I'm happy to debunk any myth, whoever makes it, because the laws of science are politically
497580	498580	neutral.
498620	503020	Now, I don't ask for donations and my channel isn't monetised.
503020	507380	If you really feel bad about watching these well researched videos for free, or if you
507380	512080	don't want to accept scientific conclusions and think I'm a human deformation, you can
512080	517180	donate to a charity that I really like, and that I hope we can all support, detailed in
517180	519740	the more recent video descriptions.
519740	520540	Thanks for watching.
