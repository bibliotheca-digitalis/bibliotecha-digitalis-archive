00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:13,780
Hello, and welcome.

2
00:00:13,780 --> 00:00:19,160
This channel is part of the fight back against junk science that's now pervading the internet.

3
00:00:19,160 --> 00:00:27,560
If you want to know whether some of the scientific claims you see in blogs and videos are true,

4
00:00:27,560 --> 00:00:31,660
and you're interested in knowing what the real science says, this might be the channel

5
00:00:31,660 --> 00:00:33,080
for you.

6
00:00:33,080 --> 00:00:34,600
My name's Peter Hadfield.

7
00:00:34,600 --> 00:00:39,580
I'm a former geologist who became a professional science journalist back in the days before

8
00:00:39,580 --> 00:00:45,840
the internet, so I do my research the old-fashioned way, I track down where the bloggers and video

9
00:00:45,840 --> 00:00:51,260
makers got their information from, and then show how they changed, misunderstood, or even

10
00:00:51,260 --> 00:00:54,000
deliberately misrepresented it.

11
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:55,760
But why don't I show you an example?

12
00:00:55,760 --> 00:01:00,240
Here's a snippet debunking an episode of the TV programme Conspiracy Theory.

13
00:01:00,240 --> 00:01:04,200
The top secret government project that can destroy the world.

14
00:01:04,200 --> 00:01:08,880
Here's Jesse Ventura investigating Harp's triggering of the Boxing Day tsunami that

15
00:01:08,880 --> 00:01:11,280
hit large parts of South East Asia.

16
00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:15,800
This photo was actually taken just before the big tsunami hit the coast of Indonesia.

17
00:01:15,800 --> 00:01:19,040
So how do we know it was taken just before the tsunami?

18
00:01:19,040 --> 00:01:23,600
It meant taking the Conspiracy Show logo off the bottom of the photo and doing a search

19
00:01:23,600 --> 00:01:25,700
for it on Google Images.

20
00:01:25,700 --> 00:01:31,720
And presto, I discovered exactly the same photo on sale for $24 at Dave Miller's Posters

21
00:01:31,720 --> 00:01:33,760
Wanted website.

22
00:01:33,760 --> 00:01:38,240
Not only is there no indication that this commercial picture was taken before, or even

23
00:01:38,240 --> 00:01:42,280
in the same decade as the tsunami, it's not even in the same hemisphere.

24
00:01:42,280 --> 00:01:47,960
It is advertised as the Aurora Australis, the Southern Lights.

25
00:01:47,960 --> 00:01:53,000
And after busting the myths in TV shows, blogs, videos and newspapers, I show what the real

26
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:54,600
science says.

27
00:01:54,600 --> 00:01:55,960
Not my theories.

28
00:01:55,960 --> 00:01:59,600
That would make me no better than all the MOOC experts on the internet.

29
00:01:59,600 --> 00:02:03,840
I'm talking about the science that's taught to the next generation of scientists that

30
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:06,640
comes from the scientific literature.

31
00:02:06,640 --> 00:02:11,520
And I promise it's not hard to follow, even if you dropped out of science in high school.

32
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:15,360
You'll be able to see right through some of the tricks the media try to pull.

33
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:17,560
Here are three more clips from my videos.

34
00:02:17,560 --> 00:02:23,040
Because if GMOs really are the cause of cancer, brain damage, metabolic collapse, and what

35
00:02:23,040 --> 00:02:24,040
else?

36
00:02:24,040 --> 00:02:27,760
Yeah, right.

37
00:02:27,760 --> 00:02:32,200
Then that ought to show up among the billions of people and animals who've been consuming

38
00:02:32,200 --> 00:02:37,320
it over the last 20 to 30 years, compared to those who haven't.

39
00:02:37,320 --> 00:02:40,800
The studies that have been done have all drawn a blank.

40
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:42,800
So let's try the opposite tack.

41
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:45,520
This is a dinosaur bone, by the way, it's been replaced by minerals.

42
00:02:45,520 --> 00:02:50,760
Whoa, hold on, before you get to the but, did I just hear you say, it's been replaced

43
00:02:50,760 --> 00:02:51,760
by minerals?

44
00:02:51,760 --> 00:02:54,520
So in fact, there's no carbon in it.

45
00:02:54,520 --> 00:02:58,600
And this would seem to be rather a crucial requirement if you want to perform carbon

46
00:02:58,600 --> 00:02:59,600
dating.

47
00:02:59,600 --> 00:03:03,160
If I took this to a laboratory and said, would you please date this, they would say, oh well,

48
00:03:03,160 --> 00:03:06,240
we'd have to use something other than carbon dating, because this is too old for carbon

49
00:03:06,240 --> 00:03:07,240
dating.

50
00:03:07,240 --> 00:03:08,240
No, Ken, they wouldn't.

51
00:03:08,240 --> 00:03:10,280
They'd say, Oi, haven't!

52
00:03:10,280 --> 00:03:11,760
We can't carbon date this!

53
00:03:11,800 --> 00:03:14,000
There's no f***ing carbon in it!

54
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:18,760
Let's take the graph on the left first, which narrator Warren Meyer says comes from Moberg's

55
00:03:18,760 --> 00:03:21,240
2005 study.

56
00:03:21,240 --> 00:03:25,760
If we look at Moberg's original, we can see that the instrumental temperature data showing

57
00:03:25,760 --> 00:03:29,360
late 20th century warming has been erased.

58
00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:34,160
Worse than that, Moberg's proxy data, that he says in the caption goes back as far as

59
00:03:34,160 --> 00:03:39,720
1979, is extended to make it look as though it goes up to the year 2000.

60
00:03:39,720 --> 00:03:42,120
The scale's been changed.

61
00:03:42,120 --> 00:03:46,400
You can see that more clearly when I match the two graphs up.

62
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:50,640
Notice how the doctored graph ends short of the recent period of warming, but the date

63
00:03:50,640 --> 00:03:53,960
has been changed to 2000.

64
00:03:53,960 --> 00:03:58,920
So in the doctored graph, 30 years of warming is simply airbrushed out, and the scale...

65
00:03:58,920 --> 00:04:02,200
And if you dispute something, I've said, hey, no problem.

66
00:04:02,200 --> 00:04:08,000
I list all my sources in the video descriptions, whether it's the source of whatever I'm critiquing,

67
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:12,920
so you can be sure I haven't set up a straw man, or whether it's a list of my scientific

68
00:04:12,920 --> 00:04:17,620
sources so that you can check I'm reporting the science accurately.

69
00:04:17,620 --> 00:04:23,480
And if anyone does find a mistake, however small, I'm always happy to issue a correction.

70
00:04:23,480 --> 00:04:25,520
Citing sources and correcting errors?

71
00:04:25,520 --> 00:04:26,520
On YouTube?

72
00:04:26,520 --> 00:04:28,840
Yes, it can be done.

73
00:04:28,840 --> 00:04:33,520
And if you can't find any errors, well, just let off steam by telling me I'm a dickhead.

74
00:04:33,520 --> 00:04:35,700
You'll feel so much better.

75
00:04:35,900 --> 00:04:40,340
Another thing I try to do is show people how to be sceptical, and check stuff they read

76
00:04:40,340 --> 00:04:44,480
on the internet, because a lot of people ask me how it's done.

77
00:04:44,480 --> 00:04:48,840
From how to tell the difference between a reputable scientific journal and a junk one,

78
00:04:48,840 --> 00:04:51,820
to the basics of tracking down sources.

79
00:04:51,820 --> 00:04:53,500
Here are a few examples.

80
00:04:53,500 --> 00:04:57,160
That's close to a 10% difference, which is not much.

81
00:04:57,160 --> 00:05:01,900
So as always, we have to ask, where do Lomborg's figures come from?

82
00:05:01,900 --> 00:05:03,880
PragerU doesn't tell us.

83
00:05:03,880 --> 00:05:07,120
So I emailed Lomborg to ask him.

84
00:05:07,120 --> 00:05:12,760
His office told me his source is this paper by Hawkins et al, and right up top the abstract

85
00:05:12,760 --> 00:05:20,380
shows not a 10% difference, as Lomborg says, but a range from 10% to 24%.

86
00:05:20,380 --> 00:05:25,400
The authors later issued a corrigendum, and that figure was corrected to between 17 and

87
00:05:25,400 --> 00:05:29,360
30%, which is even further from Lomborg's claim.

88
00:05:29,360 --> 00:05:33,740
The first thing that comes to mind is that Lomborg cherry-picked the figures, but I can't

89
00:05:33,740 --> 00:05:36,020
say that without reading the study.

90
00:05:36,020 --> 00:05:40,860
OK, I've read the study, and yep, he cherry-picked the figures.

91
00:05:40,860 --> 00:05:45,760
The Mail doesn't even cite its source, but it does give a keyword and a date, so it's

92
00:05:45,760 --> 00:05:51,920
not hard to search Google Scholar for the word Roynemur and find the relevant paper.

93
00:05:51,920 --> 00:05:56,180
And it's quickly apparent that it doesn't say the Maldives will become uninhabitable

94
00:05:56,180 --> 00:05:58,540
by 2030 at all.

95
00:05:58,540 --> 00:06:00,980
So here are a few warning signs.

96
00:06:01,220 --> 00:06:06,700
First, be wary of anyone who feels the need to dress up in order to impart scientific

97
00:06:06,700 --> 00:06:11,020
information, especially when his lab coat looks like it's never been used.

98
00:06:11,020 --> 00:06:12,300
I'm part of a group of doctors.

99
00:06:12,300 --> 00:06:17,020
Second, be wary of someone who says he's part of a group of doctors, when in fact he's

100
00:06:17,020 --> 00:06:18,020
a chiropractor.

101
00:06:18,020 --> 00:06:21,340
Better out bringing the truth about genetically modified foods.

102
00:06:21,340 --> 00:06:25,820
Thirdly, never trust anyone who tells you he's speaking the truth.

103
00:06:25,820 --> 00:06:28,900
Science depends on evidence that's consistent with a hypothesis.

104
00:06:28,900 --> 00:06:31,660
And the harmful effects that it has on our health.

105
00:06:31,660 --> 00:06:34,420
And fourth, check the information.

106
00:06:34,420 --> 00:06:39,780
The problem seems to be that Tony's only reading the abstract of the study on a NASA website.

107
00:06:39,780 --> 00:06:45,140
He needs to read the paper itself, where the source of his misunderstanding is revealed.

108
00:06:45,140 --> 00:06:51,600
In the paper itself, the authors show that ozone depletion and greenhouse gases exacerbated

109
00:06:51,600 --> 00:06:55,700
a phenomenon called the Southern Annular Mode, or the SAM.

110
00:06:55,700 --> 00:07:00,820
My conclusion was that recent cooling over the Antarctic continental interior has likely

111
00:07:00,820 --> 00:07:05,420
been caused by both ozone depletion and greenhouse gas increases.

112
00:07:05,420 --> 00:07:09,660
And having worked in television for three decades, I teach some of the media tricks

113
00:07:09,660 --> 00:07:14,680
that less reputable video makers use to pull the wool over your eyes, so that you can watch

114
00:07:14,680 --> 00:07:15,680
out for them.

115
00:07:15,680 --> 00:07:18,340
Well then how did it get created?

116
00:07:18,340 --> 00:07:22,300
Well, um, by a very slow process.

117
00:07:22,300 --> 00:07:23,300
Well how did it start?

118
00:07:23,300 --> 00:07:25,460
Nobody knows how it started.

119
00:07:25,460 --> 00:07:27,580
We know the kind of event that it must have been.

120
00:07:27,580 --> 00:07:31,180
We know the sort of event that must have happened for the origin of life.

121
00:07:31,180 --> 00:07:36,780
Four very obvious cuts in both the audio and the video, in the space of just a few seconds.

122
00:07:36,780 --> 00:07:41,420
Taking us from a question about the origin of the universe, to an answer about the origin

123
00:07:41,420 --> 00:07:42,420
of life.

124
00:07:42,420 --> 00:07:47,340
Finally, it doesn't matter which side of the political spectrum anyone's on, or which god

125
00:07:47,340 --> 00:07:50,540
you believe in, science doesn't distinguish.

126
00:07:50,540 --> 00:07:51,540
And neither do I.

127
00:07:52,540 --> 00:07:59,280
Evolution is the way things change over time, over a billion years or more.

128
00:07:59,280 --> 00:08:03,980
In his film An Inconvenient Truth, Al Gore used a graph like this to show a correlation

129
00:08:03,980 --> 00:08:08,020
between carbon dioxide levels and increased temperatures.

130
00:08:08,020 --> 00:08:12,420
But he obscured the fact that the carbon dioxide increases lag the temperature increases.

131
00:08:12,420 --> 00:08:17,580
I'm happy to debunk any myth, whoever makes it, because the laws of science are politically

132
00:08:17,580 --> 00:08:18,580
neutral.

133
00:08:18,620 --> 00:08:23,020
Now, I don't ask for donations and my channel isn't monetised.

134
00:08:23,020 --> 00:08:27,380
If you really feel bad about watching these well researched videos for free, or if you

135
00:08:27,380 --> 00:08:32,080
don't want to accept scientific conclusions and think I'm a human deformation, you can

136
00:08:32,080 --> 00:08:37,180
donate to a charity that I really like, and that I hope we can all support, detailed in

137
00:08:37,180 --> 00:08:39,740
the more recent video descriptions.

138
00:08:39,740 --> 00:08:40,540
Thanks for watching.
