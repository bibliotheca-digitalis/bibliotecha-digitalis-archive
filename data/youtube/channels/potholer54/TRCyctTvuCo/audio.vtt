WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:05.720
I bet my exhausted subscribers will by now be saying, surely there's not still more bunkum

00:05.720 --> 00:08.160
to come from Christopher Monckton?

00:08.160 --> 00:12.640
Well afraid so, but I'll cut things short by making this the last debunking video on

00:12.640 --> 00:16.040
the error-prone Viscount, and just deal with this.

00:16.040 --> 00:19.740
At the moment the polar ice caps of Mars are melting.

00:19.740 --> 00:24.960
There has been warming noticed on the surface of Jupiter, on one of the moons of Neptune,

00:24.960 --> 00:29.840
even on far distant Pluto, all at the same time.

00:29.840 --> 00:31.080
And why is this?

00:31.080 --> 00:34.120
Because astronauts are taking their 4x4s up into space?

00:34.120 --> 00:40.280
No, it's because the Sun, as we'll see, has been remarkably active.

00:40.280 --> 00:45.500
The obvious question for sceptics like me to ask is, if it's so obviously the Sun, why

00:45.500 --> 00:48.080
do climate scientists say it isn't?

00:48.080 --> 00:49.960
Isn't that worth checking?

00:49.960 --> 00:55.960
Well it turns out, as usual, climate scientists know something that Christopher Monckton doesn't.

00:55.960 --> 01:00.240
Solar planets are not all-warming, as I pointed out in a previous video.

01:00.240 --> 01:04.240
And solar physicists don't measure the output of the Sun by looking at the temperature of

01:04.240 --> 01:05.960
the moons of Neptune.

01:05.960 --> 01:11.300
We can measure solar irradiance directly, and much more accurately, from Earth, as Monckton

01:11.300 --> 01:13.000
now ably demonstrates.

01:13.000 --> 01:17.480
Now let's go to this very interesting paper by Sami Solanki.

01:17.480 --> 01:21.520
He's one of the most expert solar physicists, he's very balanced, he doesn't take either

01:21.520 --> 01:23.140
side in this debate.

01:23.140 --> 01:29.140
What he says is, the level of solar activity during the past 70 years is exceptional, and

01:29.140 --> 01:35.540
the previous period of equally high activity occurred more than 8,000 years ago.

01:35.540 --> 01:41.660
We find that during the past 11,400 years, the Sun has spent only of the order of 10%

01:41.660 --> 01:46.020
of the time at a similarly high level of magnetic activity, and almost all of the earlier high

01:46.020 --> 01:51.080
activity periods were shorter than the present episode.

01:52.080 --> 01:55.000
Wait, why did he stop reading?

01:55.000 --> 01:59.160
That's all Monckton gives his audience, and that's all he shows on his screen.

01:59.160 --> 02:04.320
He doesn't show them the actual paper, otherwise they might start reading it for themselves.

02:04.320 --> 02:08.760
So let's go back to it and see what Solanki and his fellow researchers say in the very

02:08.760 --> 02:10.680
next sentence.

02:10.680 --> 02:14.940
Although the rarity of the current episode of high average sunspot numbers may indicate

02:14.940 --> 02:19.720
that the Sun has contributed to the unusual climate change during the 20th century, we

02:19.760 --> 02:24.960
point out that solar variability is unlikely to have been the dominant cause of strong

02:24.960 --> 02:28.320
warming during the past three decades.

02:28.320 --> 02:33.120
What Solanki found was that with carbon dioxide levels fairly stable, the Sun has been the

02:33.120 --> 02:38.180
main driver of climate over the last 11,000 years, as would be expected.

02:38.180 --> 02:42.580
And even in the early 20th century, global temperatures correlate very well with varying

02:42.580 --> 02:44.400
solar irradiance.

02:44.400 --> 02:49.020
If we look at the graph in Solanki's 2003 paper, we can see that global temperatures

02:49.020 --> 02:55.220
climbed even higher when solar irradiance climbed to their peak between 1920 and 1950.

02:55.220 --> 03:00.860
But since the 1950s, solar irradiance has maintained that high without going any higher.

03:00.860 --> 03:03.980
In fact, some researchers say it's even declined slightly.

03:03.980 --> 03:09.020
So temperatures should have followed, as they have done for the past 11,000 years.

03:09.020 --> 03:10.460
But they don't.

03:10.460 --> 03:13.400
Something else is pushing them up.

03:13.400 --> 03:18.020
So Solanki's research fits perfectly with what other climate scientists have discovered.

03:18.020 --> 03:22.840
For the first time, temperatures are not following the variations of solar activity.

03:22.840 --> 03:27.760
Even the charts Monckton uses to try to support his claim that solar activity is causing global

03:27.760 --> 03:31.500
temperatures to rise show that cannot be the case.

03:31.500 --> 03:35.180
He based this chart on one in this paper by Hathaway and Wilson.

03:35.180 --> 03:36.620
Here's the original.

03:36.620 --> 03:42.900
It also shows the recent decline in solar activity very clearly based on sunspot numbers.

03:42.900 --> 03:46.620
Monckton pressed on with yet another paper he doesn't seem to have read.

03:46.620 --> 03:52.140
But the solar physicists, you might take Scafetta and West, say, in 2008, they attribute

03:52.140 --> 03:57.520
69% of all the recent global warming to the sun.

03:57.520 --> 04:01.420
Most solar physicists agree the International Astronomical Union 2004 had a symposium on

04:01.420 --> 04:02.420
it.

04:02.420 --> 04:03.420
They concluded that that was the case.

04:03.420 --> 04:06.660
They said we're now going to get global cooling because the sun's turned itself off for a

04:06.660 --> 04:07.660
bit.

04:07.660 --> 04:08.660
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

04:08.660 --> 04:10.620
There's too much here to deal with in just one hit.

04:10.620 --> 04:12.740
Let's debunk this one error at a time.

04:12.740 --> 04:20.060
But the solar physicists, you might take Scafetta and West, say, in 2008, they attribute 69%

04:20.060 --> 04:22.740
of all the recent global warming to the sun.

04:22.740 --> 04:23.740
No, they don't.

04:23.740 --> 04:28.300
Scafetta's paper doesn't attribute 69% of warming to the sun at all.

04:28.300 --> 04:34.460
It says the sun could account for as much as 69% of warming since 1900.

04:34.460 --> 04:35.460
Most solar physicists agree.

04:35.460 --> 04:36.460
No, they don't.

04:36.460 --> 04:41.060
Scafetta and West's maximum figure is at the extreme high end of the range.

04:41.060 --> 04:43.340
Most solar physicists put the figure much lower.

04:43.340 --> 04:46.100
The International Astronomical Union 2004 had a symposium on it.

04:46.100 --> 04:47.500
They concluded that that was the case.

04:47.500 --> 04:52.700
Now this claim was just so extraordinary you'd have to be a die-hard Moncton groupie not

04:52.700 --> 04:54.600
to be sceptical of it.

04:54.600 --> 04:59.380
If a major body like the International Astronomical Union had departed from established science

04:59.380 --> 05:02.260
in this way, it would be headline news.

05:02.260 --> 05:06.080
It would completely undermine a theory that's been at the heart of climate science for over

05:06.080 --> 05:07.460
a century.

05:07.460 --> 05:12.500
How come I can't find any mention of it except in Moncton's presentations?

05:12.500 --> 05:14.340
So I did some digging.

05:14.340 --> 05:20.620
I couldn't find a record of the 2004 symposium, either online or at my local university library.

05:20.620 --> 05:24.980
Professor John Abraham, who's done a lot of work debunking Moncton, had contacted the

05:24.980 --> 05:29.380
Astronomical Union and received an denial of Moncton's claim.

05:29.380 --> 05:33.140
But unfortunately, under my own rules, I can't use this as a source.

05:33.140 --> 05:38.020
I was going to contact the Astronomical Union myself when someone referred me to a recent

05:38.020 --> 05:41.500
TV documentary that spilled the whole thing wide open.

05:41.500 --> 05:44.280
The International Astronomical Union 2004 had a symposium on it.

05:44.280 --> 05:45.880
They concluded that that was the case.

05:45.880 --> 05:49.420
The International Astronomical Union have never agreed this.

05:49.420 --> 05:55.900
This argument was put forward by one paper out of 241, submitted to the symposium in

05:55.900 --> 05:56.900
2004.

05:56.900 --> 06:01.260
It didn't represent the view of the whole union.

06:01.260 --> 06:03.060
And you said in your talk that it did.

06:03.060 --> 06:05.340
No, it didn't say it was the view of the whole union.

06:05.340 --> 06:08.140
The International Astronomical Union 2004 had a symposium on it.

06:08.140 --> 06:09.820
They concluded that that was the case.

06:09.820 --> 06:12.060
There was no such conclusion made.

06:12.060 --> 06:13.300
So there was no such paper.

06:13.300 --> 06:16.280
Which you agreed in an email to this gentleman, Spencer David.

06:16.280 --> 06:20.860
He put these accusations to you and you said, you are right.

06:20.860 --> 06:23.260
So you admitted that you had made a mistake.

06:23.260 --> 06:28.460
If what I said gives the impression that this was the view of the entire, and that was the

06:28.460 --> 06:36.180
word you used, but I didn't in my speech, IAU, then I'm very happy to make it clear

06:36.180 --> 06:38.500
that it wasn't the view of the entire IAU.

06:38.500 --> 06:41.300
Okay, so you made a mistake.

06:41.300 --> 06:42.940
So if you like, I made a mistake.

06:42.940 --> 06:44.780
No, not if you like.

06:44.780 --> 06:46.740
This isn't a matter of opinion.

06:46.740 --> 06:51.000
It's just plain wrong, like nearly every other Moncton claim.

06:51.000 --> 06:54.980
In fact, I'm not even going to bother debunking what remains of Moncton's claims, because

06:54.980 --> 06:58.340
I think by now he's been thoroughly discredited.

06:58.340 --> 07:03.060
So how has my Moncton bunkum series affected the people whose cause Moncton is trying to

07:03.060 --> 07:04.060
champion?

07:04.060 --> 07:07.260
Are there any Moncton fans left?

07:07.260 --> 07:13.860
Yep, despite clear evidence to the contrary, there are still people who don't think a Viscount,

07:13.860 --> 07:19.380
a politician with a classics education from Cambridge, can possibly misunderstand or misrepresent

07:19.380 --> 07:20.380
climate science.

07:20.380 --> 07:23.380
Ah, Lord Melbury, do please come this way, your lordship.

07:23.380 --> 07:27.200
I have your table over here by the window, as usual.

07:27.240 --> 07:32.640
It is the modus operandus of bought-and-paid-for corporate scum like Pothole of 54 to search

07:32.640 --> 07:35.080
for tiny mistakes in the output of sceptics.

07:35.080 --> 07:36.640
They have vast resources.

07:36.640 --> 07:41.680
No, you don't need vast resources to check Moncton's claims.

07:41.680 --> 07:44.680
All you need is a healthy degree of scepticism.

07:44.680 --> 07:46.800
I didn't search for tiny mistakes.

07:46.800 --> 07:51.020
I simply checked Moncton's claims, and they turned out to be wrong.

07:51.020 --> 07:53.000
Anyone can do the same thing.

07:53.000 --> 07:57.280
Watch a Moncton video, look up the sources he cites, and check them.

07:57.280 --> 08:02.440
The reason so many Moncton fans don't do this isn't because of a lack of resources, it's

08:02.440 --> 08:05.040
because of a lack of scepticism.

08:05.040 --> 08:06.840
But Eric has more.

08:06.840 --> 08:07.840
Moncton made a mistake.

08:07.840 --> 08:10.720
OK, I magnified one mistake.

08:10.720 --> 08:12.960
Moncton made two small mistakes, that's all.

08:12.960 --> 08:15.640
Oh, I magnified two small mistakes.

08:15.640 --> 08:18.320
Well, I hate to be contrary, as you know.

08:18.320 --> 08:20.960
I have a maths physics degree from a Russell Group University.

08:20.960 --> 08:26.120
OK, that may well be, but let's use that maths degree to do a quick refresher course

08:26.120 --> 08:27.120
in counting.

08:27.120 --> 08:28.120
Greetings.

08:28.120 --> 08:30.160
It is I to count.

08:30.160 --> 08:32.800
Moncton says he advised Margaret Thatcher on climate change.

08:32.800 --> 08:33.800
He didn't.

08:33.800 --> 08:35.760
He says he wrote a peer-reviewed scientific paper.

08:35.760 --> 08:36.760
He didn't.

08:36.760 --> 08:37.760
He says the Earth has been cooling.

08:37.760 --> 08:38.760
It hasn't.

08:38.760 --> 08:42.100
He says Olaf Johansson found that overall Greenland ice wasn't melting.

08:42.100 --> 08:43.100
He didn't.

08:43.100 --> 08:45.640
He says there's been no systematic loss of sea ice in the Arctic.

08:45.640 --> 08:46.640
There has.

08:46.640 --> 08:50.760
He says there's no correlation between temperatures and CO2 over the last 500 million years.

08:50.760 --> 08:51.760
There is.

08:51.760 --> 08:55.320
He says a Precambrian ice planet shows that CO2 has no effect on climate.

08:55.320 --> 08:56.320
Shows the opposite.

08:56.320 --> 08:59.400
He says there's been no change in Himalayan glaciers for 200 years.

08:59.400 --> 09:00.400
There has.

09:00.400 --> 09:02.440
He says only one Himalayan glacier is retreating.

09:02.440 --> 09:03.440
No.

09:03.440 --> 09:04.440
Lots of them are.

09:04.440 --> 09:08.840
He quotes a Linzen paper to claim that forcing due to CO2 is 1.135 watts per square metre.

09:08.840 --> 09:11.200
Linzen's paper shows forcing is three times higher.

09:11.200 --> 09:12.920
He confuses forcing with sensitivity.

09:12.920 --> 09:17.320
He says Dr Pinker's research shows that a loss of cloud cover is responsible for recent

09:17.320 --> 09:18.320
warming.

09:18.320 --> 09:19.520
She says it shows no such thing.

09:19.520 --> 09:24.040
He misquotes Kevin Tremburth, Justice Burton, Murari Lal and Sir John Houghton.

09:24.040 --> 09:27.320
He says planets with a high albedo are cooler than planets with a low albedo.

09:27.320 --> 09:28.320
Wrong.

09:28.320 --> 09:31.480
And in the video you're looking at we've seen that he got Scafetta's paper wrong and he

09:31.480 --> 09:33.040
got Solanki's paper wrong.

09:33.040 --> 09:35.360
He says some planets are warming because of the sun.

09:35.360 --> 09:36.360
No they're not.

09:36.360 --> 09:39.880
And he said the International Astronomical Union has declared that the sun's responsible

09:39.880 --> 09:41.720
for recent warming.

09:41.720 --> 09:42.720
It didn't.

09:42.720 --> 09:45.240
Well how are you Lord Melvray?

09:45.240 --> 09:46.840
How are you then?

09:46.840 --> 09:47.840
Alright mate?

09:48.160 --> 09:51.120
How's me old bucker?

09:51.120 --> 09:55.160
I don't have a degree in mathematics from a Russell Group University but I'd say that's

09:55.160 --> 09:57.300
more than a couple of mistakes.

09:57.300 --> 10:01.920
And these aren't just minor nit-picked errors, these are the most egregious falsehoods that

10:01.920 --> 10:05.640
make up Moncton's entire case against climate science.

10:05.640 --> 10:09.200
These are the things Moncton insists the scientists have got wrong.

10:09.200 --> 10:14.480
Why do those who are peddling this threat have to lie?

10:14.480 --> 10:16.480
Stop telling lies.

10:16.480 --> 10:20.720
So however many lies are uttered.

10:20.720 --> 10:25.240
But it turns out he's the one that got things wrong, so much so that it would probably be

10:25.240 --> 10:28.500
easier to find things he actually got right.

10:28.500 --> 10:31.200
So I'll extend that challenge to Moncton fans.

10:31.200 --> 10:34.000
Find something that Moncton managed to get right.

10:34.000 --> 10:38.720
Not the dates of papers or correctly identifying the names of the towns where he was speaking,

10:38.720 --> 10:43.120
but something that contradicts climate scientists who conclude that the earth is warming and

10:43.120 --> 10:46.360
that carbon dioxide is largely responsible.

10:46.360 --> 10:51.640
But please, before you simply copy and paste a Moncton claim, do something you might never

10:51.640 --> 10:53.300
have done before.

10:53.300 --> 10:54.300
Check it.

10:54.300 --> 10:57.560
If he doesn't give a source, write and ask him for his source.

10:57.560 --> 10:59.280
Then check that.

10:59.280 --> 11:01.200
You're allowed to cheat, by the way.

11:01.200 --> 11:06.240
Check other sites that debunk Moncton's claims, like John Abraham's website and Peter Sinclair's

11:06.240 --> 11:08.880
excellent video series on YouTube.

11:08.880 --> 11:11.120
And check their sources too.

11:11.120 --> 11:15.800
I started this Moncton Buncombe series by asking why people believe him.

11:15.800 --> 11:21.320
And after watching hours of Moncton presentations, I can't understand why anybody who's sceptical

11:21.320 --> 11:22.880
would believe him.

11:22.880 --> 11:27.640
As we've seen, he clearly doesn't know that much basic climatology, he gets his calculations

11:27.640 --> 11:32.560
hopelessly wrong, he misunderstands or doesn't properly read most of the scientific papers

11:32.560 --> 11:36.340
he quotes, and he continually contradicts himself.

11:36.340 --> 11:39.280
But we're not dealing with an audience full of sceptics.

11:39.280 --> 11:42.880
We're dealing for the most part with people who are willing to cheer anyone who echoes

11:42.880 --> 11:46.160
their own beliefs loudly and confidently enough.

11:46.160 --> 11:49.560
Ironically, these people like to call themselves sceptics.

11:49.560 --> 11:53.640
Sorry guys, but being a sceptic means you check what you're told.

11:53.640 --> 11:58.440
It doesn't mean you believe what someone says simply because he's got a title, or he sounds

11:58.440 --> 12:01.800
confident of his facts, or he's good at Latin.

12:01.800 --> 12:05.340
So if you want to be a real sceptic, take up my challenge.

12:05.340 --> 12:10.160
Check what Moncton says, check his sources, and find something he actually managed to

12:10.160 --> 12:10.880
get right.
