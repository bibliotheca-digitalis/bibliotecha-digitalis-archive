0	5720	I bet my exhausted subscribers will by now be saying, surely there's not still more bunkum
5720	8160	to come from Christopher Monckton?
8160	12640	Well afraid so, but I'll cut things short by making this the last debunking video on
12640	16040	the error-prone Viscount, and just deal with this.
16040	19740	At the moment the polar ice caps of Mars are melting.
19740	24960	There has been warming noticed on the surface of Jupiter, on one of the moons of Neptune,
24960	29840	even on far distant Pluto, all at the same time.
29840	31080	And why is this?
31080	34120	Because astronauts are taking their 4x4s up into space?
34120	40280	No, it's because the Sun, as we'll see, has been remarkably active.
40280	45500	The obvious question for sceptics like me to ask is, if it's so obviously the Sun, why
45500	48080	do climate scientists say it isn't?
48080	49960	Isn't that worth checking?
49960	55960	Well it turns out, as usual, climate scientists know something that Christopher Monckton doesn't.
55960	60240	Solar planets are not all-warming, as I pointed out in a previous video.
60240	64240	And solar physicists don't measure the output of the Sun by looking at the temperature of
64240	65960	the moons of Neptune.
65960	71300	We can measure solar irradiance directly, and much more accurately, from Earth, as Monckton
71300	73000	now ably demonstrates.
73000	77480	Now let's go to this very interesting paper by Sami Solanki.
77480	81520	He's one of the most expert solar physicists, he's very balanced, he doesn't take either
81520	83140	side in this debate.
83140	89140	What he says is, the level of solar activity during the past 70 years is exceptional, and
89140	95540	the previous period of equally high activity occurred more than 8,000 years ago.
95540	101660	We find that during the past 11,400 years, the Sun has spent only of the order of 10%
101660	106020	of the time at a similarly high level of magnetic activity, and almost all of the earlier high
106020	111080	activity periods were shorter than the present episode.
112080	115000	Wait, why did he stop reading?
115000	119160	That's all Monckton gives his audience, and that's all he shows on his screen.
119160	124320	He doesn't show them the actual paper, otherwise they might start reading it for themselves.
124320	128760	So let's go back to it and see what Solanki and his fellow researchers say in the very
128760	130680	next sentence.
130680	134940	Although the rarity of the current episode of high average sunspot numbers may indicate
134940	139720	that the Sun has contributed to the unusual climate change during the 20th century, we
139760	144960	point out that solar variability is unlikely to have been the dominant cause of strong
144960	148320	warming during the past three decades.
148320	153120	What Solanki found was that with carbon dioxide levels fairly stable, the Sun has been the
153120	158180	main driver of climate over the last 11,000 years, as would be expected.
158180	162580	And even in the early 20th century, global temperatures correlate very well with varying
162580	164400	solar irradiance.
164400	169020	If we look at the graph in Solanki's 2003 paper, we can see that global temperatures
169020	175220	climbed even higher when solar irradiance climbed to their peak between 1920 and 1950.
175220	180860	But since the 1950s, solar irradiance has maintained that high without going any higher.
180860	183980	In fact, some researchers say it's even declined slightly.
183980	189020	So temperatures should have followed, as they have done for the past 11,000 years.
189020	190460	But they don't.
190460	193400	Something else is pushing them up.
193400	198020	So Solanki's research fits perfectly with what other climate scientists have discovered.
198020	202840	For the first time, temperatures are not following the variations of solar activity.
202840	207760	Even the charts Monckton uses to try to support his claim that solar activity is causing global
207760	211500	temperatures to rise show that cannot be the case.
211500	215180	He based this chart on one in this paper by Hathaway and Wilson.
215180	216620	Here's the original.
216620	222900	It also shows the recent decline in solar activity very clearly based on sunspot numbers.
222900	226620	Monckton pressed on with yet another paper he doesn't seem to have read.
226620	232140	But the solar physicists, you might take Scafetta and West, say, in 2008, they attribute
232140	237520	69% of all the recent global warming to the sun.
237520	241420	Most solar physicists agree the International Astronomical Union 2004 had a symposium on
241420	242420	it.
242420	243420	They concluded that that was the case.
243420	246660	They said we're now going to get global cooling because the sun's turned itself off for a
246660	247660	bit.
247660	248660	Whoa, whoa, whoa.
248660	250620	There's too much here to deal with in just one hit.
250620	252740	Let's debunk this one error at a time.
252740	260060	But the solar physicists, you might take Scafetta and West, say, in 2008, they attribute 69%
260060	262740	of all the recent global warming to the sun.
262740	263740	No, they don't.
263740	268300	Scafetta's paper doesn't attribute 69% of warming to the sun at all.
268300	274460	It says the sun could account for as much as 69% of warming since 1900.
274460	275460	Most solar physicists agree.
275460	276460	No, they don't.
276460	281060	Scafetta and West's maximum figure is at the extreme high end of the range.
281060	283340	Most solar physicists put the figure much lower.
283340	286100	The International Astronomical Union 2004 had a symposium on it.
286100	287500	They concluded that that was the case.
287500	292700	Now this claim was just so extraordinary you'd have to be a die-hard Moncton groupie not
292700	294600	to be sceptical of it.
294600	299380	If a major body like the International Astronomical Union had departed from established science
299380	302260	in this way, it would be headline news.
302260	306080	It would completely undermine a theory that's been at the heart of climate science for over
306080	307460	a century.
307460	312500	How come I can't find any mention of it except in Moncton's presentations?
312500	314340	So I did some digging.
314340	320620	I couldn't find a record of the 2004 symposium, either online or at my local university library.
320620	324980	Professor John Abraham, who's done a lot of work debunking Moncton, had contacted the
324980	329380	Astronomical Union and received an denial of Moncton's claim.
329380	333140	But unfortunately, under my own rules, I can't use this as a source.
333140	338020	I was going to contact the Astronomical Union myself when someone referred me to a recent
338020	341500	TV documentary that spilled the whole thing wide open.
341500	344280	The International Astronomical Union 2004 had a symposium on it.
344280	345880	They concluded that that was the case.
345880	349420	The International Astronomical Union have never agreed this.
349420	355900	This argument was put forward by one paper out of 241, submitted to the symposium in
355900	356900	2004.
356900	361260	It didn't represent the view of the whole union.
361260	363060	And you said in your talk that it did.
363060	365340	No, it didn't say it was the view of the whole union.
365340	368140	The International Astronomical Union 2004 had a symposium on it.
368140	369820	They concluded that that was the case.
369820	372060	There was no such conclusion made.
372060	373300	So there was no such paper.
373300	376280	Which you agreed in an email to this gentleman, Spencer David.
376280	380860	He put these accusations to you and you said, you are right.
380860	383260	So you admitted that you had made a mistake.
383260	388460	If what I said gives the impression that this was the view of the entire, and that was the
388460	396180	word you used, but I didn't in my speech, IAU, then I'm very happy to make it clear
396180	398500	that it wasn't the view of the entire IAU.
398500	401300	Okay, so you made a mistake.
401300	402940	So if you like, I made a mistake.
402940	404780	No, not if you like.
404780	406740	This isn't a matter of opinion.
406740	411000	It's just plain wrong, like nearly every other Moncton claim.
411000	414980	In fact, I'm not even going to bother debunking what remains of Moncton's claims, because
414980	418340	I think by now he's been thoroughly discredited.
418340	423060	So how has my Moncton bunkum series affected the people whose cause Moncton is trying to
423060	424060	champion?
424060	427260	Are there any Moncton fans left?
427260	433860	Yep, despite clear evidence to the contrary, there are still people who don't think a Viscount,
433860	439380	a politician with a classics education from Cambridge, can possibly misunderstand or misrepresent
439380	440380	climate science.
440380	443380	Ah, Lord Melbury, do please come this way, your lordship.
443380	447200	I have your table over here by the window, as usual.
447240	452640	It is the modus operandus of bought-and-paid-for corporate scum like Pothole of 54 to search
452640	455080	for tiny mistakes in the output of sceptics.
455080	456640	They have vast resources.
456640	461680	No, you don't need vast resources to check Moncton's claims.
461680	464680	All you need is a healthy degree of scepticism.
464680	466800	I didn't search for tiny mistakes.
466800	471020	I simply checked Moncton's claims, and they turned out to be wrong.
471020	473000	Anyone can do the same thing.
473000	477280	Watch a Moncton video, look up the sources he cites, and check them.
477280	482440	The reason so many Moncton fans don't do this isn't because of a lack of resources, it's
482440	485040	because of a lack of scepticism.
485040	486840	But Eric has more.
486840	487840	Moncton made a mistake.
487840	490720	OK, I magnified one mistake.
490720	492960	Moncton made two small mistakes, that's all.
492960	495640	Oh, I magnified two small mistakes.
495640	498320	Well, I hate to be contrary, as you know.
498320	500960	I have a maths physics degree from a Russell Group University.
500960	506120	OK, that may well be, but let's use that maths degree to do a quick refresher course
506120	507120	in counting.
507120	508120	Greetings.
508120	510160	It is I to count.
510160	512800	Moncton says he advised Margaret Thatcher on climate change.
512800	513800	He didn't.
513800	515760	He says he wrote a peer-reviewed scientific paper.
515760	516760	He didn't.
516760	517760	He says the Earth has been cooling.
517760	518760	It hasn't.
518760	522100	He says Olaf Johansson found that overall Greenland ice wasn't melting.
522100	523100	He didn't.
523100	525640	He says there's been no systematic loss of sea ice in the Arctic.
525640	526640	There has.
526640	530760	He says there's no correlation between temperatures and CO2 over the last 500 million years.
530760	531760	There is.
531760	535320	He says a Precambrian ice planet shows that CO2 has no effect on climate.
535320	536320	Shows the opposite.
536320	539400	He says there's been no change in Himalayan glaciers for 200 years.
539400	540400	There has.
540400	542440	He says only one Himalayan glacier is retreating.
542440	543440	No.
543440	544440	Lots of them are.
544440	548840	He quotes a Linzen paper to claim that forcing due to CO2 is 1.135 watts per square metre.
548840	551200	Linzen's paper shows forcing is three times higher.
551200	552920	He confuses forcing with sensitivity.
552920	557320	He says Dr Pinker's research shows that a loss of cloud cover is responsible for recent
557320	558320	warming.
558320	559520	She says it shows no such thing.
559520	564040	He misquotes Kevin Tremburth, Justice Burton, Murari Lal and Sir John Houghton.
564040	567320	He says planets with a high albedo are cooler than planets with a low albedo.
567320	568320	Wrong.
568320	571480	And in the video you're looking at we've seen that he got Scafetta's paper wrong and he
571480	573040	got Solanki's paper wrong.
573040	575360	He says some planets are warming because of the sun.
575360	576360	No they're not.
576360	579880	And he said the International Astronomical Union has declared that the sun's responsible
579880	581720	for recent warming.
581720	582720	It didn't.
582720	585240	Well how are you Lord Melvray?
585240	586840	How are you then?
586840	587840	Alright mate?
588160	591120	How's me old bucker?
591120	595160	I don't have a degree in mathematics from a Russell Group University but I'd say that's
595160	597300	more than a couple of mistakes.
597300	601920	And these aren't just minor nit-picked errors, these are the most egregious falsehoods that
601920	605640	make up Moncton's entire case against climate science.
605640	609200	These are the things Moncton insists the scientists have got wrong.
609200	614480	Why do those who are peddling this threat have to lie?
614480	616480	Stop telling lies.
616480	620720	So however many lies are uttered.
620720	625240	But it turns out he's the one that got things wrong, so much so that it would probably be
625240	628500	easier to find things he actually got right.
628500	631200	So I'll extend that challenge to Moncton fans.
631200	634000	Find something that Moncton managed to get right.
634000	638720	Not the dates of papers or correctly identifying the names of the towns where he was speaking,
638720	643120	but something that contradicts climate scientists who conclude that the earth is warming and
643120	646360	that carbon dioxide is largely responsible.
646360	651640	But please, before you simply copy and paste a Moncton claim, do something you might never
651640	653300	have done before.
653300	654300	Check it.
654300	657560	If he doesn't give a source, write and ask him for his source.
657560	659280	Then check that.
659280	661200	You're allowed to cheat, by the way.
661200	666240	Check other sites that debunk Moncton's claims, like John Abraham's website and Peter Sinclair's
666240	668880	excellent video series on YouTube.
668880	671120	And check their sources too.
671120	675800	I started this Moncton Buncombe series by asking why people believe him.
675800	681320	And after watching hours of Moncton presentations, I can't understand why anybody who's sceptical
681320	682880	would believe him.
682880	687640	As we've seen, he clearly doesn't know that much basic climatology, he gets his calculations
687640	692560	hopelessly wrong, he misunderstands or doesn't properly read most of the scientific papers
692560	696340	he quotes, and he continually contradicts himself.
696340	699280	But we're not dealing with an audience full of sceptics.
699280	702880	We're dealing for the most part with people who are willing to cheer anyone who echoes
702880	706160	their own beliefs loudly and confidently enough.
706160	709560	Ironically, these people like to call themselves sceptics.
709560	713640	Sorry guys, but being a sceptic means you check what you're told.
713640	718440	It doesn't mean you believe what someone says simply because he's got a title, or he sounds
718440	721800	confident of his facts, or he's good at Latin.
721800	725340	So if you want to be a real sceptic, take up my challenge.
725340	730160	Check what Moncton says, check his sources, and find something he actually managed to
730160	730880	get right.
