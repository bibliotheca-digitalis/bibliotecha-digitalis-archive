1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,720
I bet my exhausted subscribers will by now be saying, surely there's not still more bunkum

2
00:00:05,720 --> 00:00:08,160
to come from Christopher Monckton?

3
00:00:08,160 --> 00:00:12,640
Well afraid so, but I'll cut things short by making this the last debunking video on

4
00:00:12,640 --> 00:00:16,040
the error-prone Viscount, and just deal with this.

5
00:00:16,040 --> 00:00:19,740
At the moment the polar ice caps of Mars are melting.

6
00:00:19,740 --> 00:00:24,960
There has been warming noticed on the surface of Jupiter, on one of the moons of Neptune,

7
00:00:24,960 --> 00:00:29,840
even on far distant Pluto, all at the same time.

8
00:00:29,840 --> 00:00:31,080
And why is this?

9
00:00:31,080 --> 00:00:34,120
Because astronauts are taking their 4x4s up into space?

10
00:00:34,120 --> 00:00:40,280
No, it's because the Sun, as we'll see, has been remarkably active.

11
00:00:40,280 --> 00:00:45,500
The obvious question for sceptics like me to ask is, if it's so obviously the Sun, why

12
00:00:45,500 --> 00:00:48,080
do climate scientists say it isn't?

13
00:00:48,080 --> 00:00:49,960
Isn't that worth checking?

14
00:00:49,960 --> 00:00:55,960
Well it turns out, as usual, climate scientists know something that Christopher Monckton doesn't.

15
00:00:55,960 --> 00:01:00,240
Solar planets are not all-warming, as I pointed out in a previous video.

16
00:01:00,240 --> 00:01:04,240
And solar physicists don't measure the output of the Sun by looking at the temperature of

17
00:01:04,240 --> 00:01:05,960
the moons of Neptune.

18
00:01:05,960 --> 00:01:11,300
We can measure solar irradiance directly, and much more accurately, from Earth, as Monckton

19
00:01:11,300 --> 00:01:13,000
now ably demonstrates.

20
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:17,480
Now let's go to this very interesting paper by Sami Solanki.

21
00:01:17,480 --> 00:01:21,520
He's one of the most expert solar physicists, he's very balanced, he doesn't take either

22
00:01:21,520 --> 00:01:23,140
side in this debate.

23
00:01:23,140 --> 00:01:29,140
What he says is, the level of solar activity during the past 70 years is exceptional, and

24
00:01:29,140 --> 00:01:35,540
the previous period of equally high activity occurred more than 8,000 years ago.

25
00:01:35,540 --> 00:01:41,660
We find that during the past 11,400 years, the Sun has spent only of the order of 10%

26
00:01:41,660 --> 00:01:46,020
of the time at a similarly high level of magnetic activity, and almost all of the earlier high

27
00:01:46,020 --> 00:01:51,080
activity periods were shorter than the present episode.

28
00:01:52,080 --> 00:01:55,000
Wait, why did he stop reading?

29
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:59,160
That's all Monckton gives his audience, and that's all he shows on his screen.

30
00:01:59,160 --> 00:02:04,320
He doesn't show them the actual paper, otherwise they might start reading it for themselves.

31
00:02:04,320 --> 00:02:08,760
So let's go back to it and see what Solanki and his fellow researchers say in the very

32
00:02:08,760 --> 00:02:10,680
next sentence.

33
00:02:10,680 --> 00:02:14,940
Although the rarity of the current episode of high average sunspot numbers may indicate

34
00:02:14,940 --> 00:02:19,720
that the Sun has contributed to the unusual climate change during the 20th century, we

35
00:02:19,760 --> 00:02:24,960
point out that solar variability is unlikely to have been the dominant cause of strong

36
00:02:24,960 --> 00:02:28,320
warming during the past three decades.

37
00:02:28,320 --> 00:02:33,120
What Solanki found was that with carbon dioxide levels fairly stable, the Sun has been the

38
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:38,180
main driver of climate over the last 11,000 years, as would be expected.

39
00:02:38,180 --> 00:02:42,580
And even in the early 20th century, global temperatures correlate very well with varying

40
00:02:42,580 --> 00:02:44,400
solar irradiance.

41
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:49,020
If we look at the graph in Solanki's 2003 paper, we can see that global temperatures

42
00:02:49,020 --> 00:02:55,220
climbed even higher when solar irradiance climbed to their peak between 1920 and 1950.

43
00:02:55,220 --> 00:03:00,860
But since the 1950s, solar irradiance has maintained that high without going any higher.

44
00:03:00,860 --> 00:03:03,980
In fact, some researchers say it's even declined slightly.

45
00:03:03,980 --> 00:03:09,020
So temperatures should have followed, as they have done for the past 11,000 years.

46
00:03:09,020 --> 00:03:10,460
But they don't.

47
00:03:10,460 --> 00:03:13,400
Something else is pushing them up.

48
00:03:13,400 --> 00:03:18,020
So Solanki's research fits perfectly with what other climate scientists have discovered.

49
00:03:18,020 --> 00:03:22,840
For the first time, temperatures are not following the variations of solar activity.

50
00:03:22,840 --> 00:03:27,760
Even the charts Monckton uses to try to support his claim that solar activity is causing global

51
00:03:27,760 --> 00:03:31,500
temperatures to rise show that cannot be the case.

52
00:03:31,500 --> 00:03:35,180
He based this chart on one in this paper by Hathaway and Wilson.

53
00:03:35,180 --> 00:03:36,620
Here's the original.

54
00:03:36,620 --> 00:03:42,900
It also shows the recent decline in solar activity very clearly based on sunspot numbers.

55
00:03:42,900 --> 00:03:46,620
Monckton pressed on with yet another paper he doesn't seem to have read.

56
00:03:46,620 --> 00:03:52,140
But the solar physicists, you might take Scafetta and West, say, in 2008, they attribute

57
00:03:52,140 --> 00:03:57,520
69% of all the recent global warming to the sun.

58
00:03:57,520 --> 00:04:01,420
Most solar physicists agree the International Astronomical Union 2004 had a symposium on

59
00:04:01,420 --> 00:04:02,420
it.

60
00:04:02,420 --> 00:04:03,420
They concluded that that was the case.

61
00:04:03,420 --> 00:04:06,660
They said we're now going to get global cooling because the sun's turned itself off for a

62
00:04:06,660 --> 00:04:07,660
bit.

63
00:04:07,660 --> 00:04:08,660
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

64
00:04:08,660 --> 00:04:10,620
There's too much here to deal with in just one hit.

65
00:04:10,620 --> 00:04:12,740
Let's debunk this one error at a time.

66
00:04:12,740 --> 00:04:20,060
But the solar physicists, you might take Scafetta and West, say, in 2008, they attribute 69%

67
00:04:20,060 --> 00:04:22,740
of all the recent global warming to the sun.

68
00:04:22,740 --> 00:04:23,740
No, they don't.

69
00:04:23,740 --> 00:04:28,300
Scafetta's paper doesn't attribute 69% of warming to the sun at all.

70
00:04:28,300 --> 00:04:34,460
It says the sun could account for as much as 69% of warming since 1900.

71
00:04:34,460 --> 00:04:35,460
Most solar physicists agree.

72
00:04:35,460 --> 00:04:36,460
No, they don't.

73
00:04:36,460 --> 00:04:41,060
Scafetta and West's maximum figure is at the extreme high end of the range.

74
00:04:41,060 --> 00:04:43,340
Most solar physicists put the figure much lower.

75
00:04:43,340 --> 00:04:46,100
The International Astronomical Union 2004 had a symposium on it.

76
00:04:46,100 --> 00:04:47,500
They concluded that that was the case.

77
00:04:47,500 --> 00:04:52,700
Now this claim was just so extraordinary you'd have to be a die-hard Moncton groupie not

78
00:04:52,700 --> 00:04:54,600
to be sceptical of it.

79
00:04:54,600 --> 00:04:59,380
If a major body like the International Astronomical Union had departed from established science

80
00:04:59,380 --> 00:05:02,260
in this way, it would be headline news.

81
00:05:02,260 --> 00:05:06,080
It would completely undermine a theory that's been at the heart of climate science for over

82
00:05:06,080 --> 00:05:07,460
a century.

83
00:05:07,460 --> 00:05:12,500
How come I can't find any mention of it except in Moncton's presentations?

84
00:05:12,500 --> 00:05:14,340
So I did some digging.

85
00:05:14,340 --> 00:05:20,620
I couldn't find a record of the 2004 symposium, either online or at my local university library.

86
00:05:20,620 --> 00:05:24,980
Professor John Abraham, who's done a lot of work debunking Moncton, had contacted the

87
00:05:24,980 --> 00:05:29,380
Astronomical Union and received an denial of Moncton's claim.

88
00:05:29,380 --> 00:05:33,140
But unfortunately, under my own rules, I can't use this as a source.

89
00:05:33,140 --> 00:05:38,020
I was going to contact the Astronomical Union myself when someone referred me to a recent

90
00:05:38,020 --> 00:05:41,500
TV documentary that spilled the whole thing wide open.

91
00:05:41,500 --> 00:05:44,280
The International Astronomical Union 2004 had a symposium on it.

92
00:05:44,280 --> 00:05:45,880
They concluded that that was the case.

93
00:05:45,880 --> 00:05:49,420
The International Astronomical Union have never agreed this.

94
00:05:49,420 --> 00:05:55,900
This argument was put forward by one paper out of 241, submitted to the symposium in

95
00:05:55,900 --> 00:05:56,900
2004.

96
00:05:56,900 --> 00:06:01,260
It didn't represent the view of the whole union.

97
00:06:01,260 --> 00:06:03,060
And you said in your talk that it did.

98
00:06:03,060 --> 00:06:05,340
No, it didn't say it was the view of the whole union.

99
00:06:05,340 --> 00:06:08,140
The International Astronomical Union 2004 had a symposium on it.

100
00:06:08,140 --> 00:06:09,820
They concluded that that was the case.

101
00:06:09,820 --> 00:06:12,060
There was no such conclusion made.

102
00:06:12,060 --> 00:06:13,300
So there was no such paper.

103
00:06:13,300 --> 00:06:16,280
Which you agreed in an email to this gentleman, Spencer David.

104
00:06:16,280 --> 00:06:20,860
He put these accusations to you and you said, you are right.

105
00:06:20,860 --> 00:06:23,260
So you admitted that you had made a mistake.

106
00:06:23,260 --> 00:06:28,460
If what I said gives the impression that this was the view of the entire, and that was the

107
00:06:28,460 --> 00:06:36,180
word you used, but I didn't in my speech, IAU, then I'm very happy to make it clear

108
00:06:36,180 --> 00:06:38,500
that it wasn't the view of the entire IAU.

109
00:06:38,500 --> 00:06:41,300
Okay, so you made a mistake.

110
00:06:41,300 --> 00:06:42,940
So if you like, I made a mistake.

111
00:06:42,940 --> 00:06:44,780
No, not if you like.

112
00:06:44,780 --> 00:06:46,740
This isn't a matter of opinion.

113
00:06:46,740 --> 00:06:51,000
It's just plain wrong, like nearly every other Moncton claim.

114
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:54,980
In fact, I'm not even going to bother debunking what remains of Moncton's claims, because

115
00:06:54,980 --> 00:06:58,340
I think by now he's been thoroughly discredited.

116
00:06:58,340 --> 00:07:03,060
So how has my Moncton bunkum series affected the people whose cause Moncton is trying to

117
00:07:03,060 --> 00:07:04,060
champion?

118
00:07:04,060 --> 00:07:07,260
Are there any Moncton fans left?

119
00:07:07,260 --> 00:07:13,860
Yep, despite clear evidence to the contrary, there are still people who don't think a Viscount,

120
00:07:13,860 --> 00:07:19,380
a politician with a classics education from Cambridge, can possibly misunderstand or misrepresent

121
00:07:19,380 --> 00:07:20,380
climate science.

122
00:07:20,380 --> 00:07:23,380
Ah, Lord Melbury, do please come this way, your lordship.

123
00:07:23,380 --> 00:07:27,200
I have your table over here by the window, as usual.

124
00:07:27,240 --> 00:07:32,640
It is the modus operandus of bought-and-paid-for corporate scum like Pothole of 54 to search

125
00:07:32,640 --> 00:07:35,080
for tiny mistakes in the output of sceptics.

126
00:07:35,080 --> 00:07:36,640
They have vast resources.

127
00:07:36,640 --> 00:07:41,680
No, you don't need vast resources to check Moncton's claims.

128
00:07:41,680 --> 00:07:44,680
All you need is a healthy degree of scepticism.

129
00:07:44,680 --> 00:07:46,800
I didn't search for tiny mistakes.

130
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:51,020
I simply checked Moncton's claims, and they turned out to be wrong.

131
00:07:51,020 --> 00:07:53,000
Anyone can do the same thing.

132
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:57,280
Watch a Moncton video, look up the sources he cites, and check them.

133
00:07:57,280 --> 00:08:02,440
The reason so many Moncton fans don't do this isn't because of a lack of resources, it's

134
00:08:02,440 --> 00:08:05,040
because of a lack of scepticism.

135
00:08:05,040 --> 00:08:06,840
But Eric has more.

136
00:08:06,840 --> 00:08:07,840
Moncton made a mistake.

137
00:08:07,840 --> 00:08:10,720
OK, I magnified one mistake.

138
00:08:10,720 --> 00:08:12,960
Moncton made two small mistakes, that's all.

139
00:08:12,960 --> 00:08:15,640
Oh, I magnified two small mistakes.

140
00:08:15,640 --> 00:08:18,320
Well, I hate to be contrary, as you know.

141
00:08:18,320 --> 00:08:20,960
I have a maths physics degree from a Russell Group University.

142
00:08:20,960 --> 00:08:26,120
OK, that may well be, but let's use that maths degree to do a quick refresher course

143
00:08:26,120 --> 00:08:27,120
in counting.

144
00:08:27,120 --> 00:08:28,120
Greetings.

145
00:08:28,120 --> 00:08:30,160
It is I to count.

146
00:08:30,160 --> 00:08:32,800
Moncton says he advised Margaret Thatcher on climate change.

147
00:08:32,800 --> 00:08:33,800
He didn't.

148
00:08:33,800 --> 00:08:35,760
He says he wrote a peer-reviewed scientific paper.

149
00:08:35,760 --> 00:08:36,760
He didn't.

150
00:08:36,760 --> 00:08:37,760
He says the Earth has been cooling.

151
00:08:37,760 --> 00:08:38,760
It hasn't.

152
00:08:38,760 --> 00:08:42,100
He says Olaf Johansson found that overall Greenland ice wasn't melting.

153
00:08:42,100 --> 00:08:43,100
He didn't.

154
00:08:43,100 --> 00:08:45,640
He says there's been no systematic loss of sea ice in the Arctic.

155
00:08:45,640 --> 00:08:46,640
There has.

156
00:08:46,640 --> 00:08:50,760
He says there's no correlation between temperatures and CO2 over the last 500 million years.

157
00:08:50,760 --> 00:08:51,760
There is.

158
00:08:51,760 --> 00:08:55,320
He says a Precambrian ice planet shows that CO2 has no effect on climate.

159
00:08:55,320 --> 00:08:56,320
Shows the opposite.

160
00:08:56,320 --> 00:08:59,400
He says there's been no change in Himalayan glaciers for 200 years.

161
00:08:59,400 --> 00:09:00,400
There has.

162
00:09:00,400 --> 00:09:02,440
He says only one Himalayan glacier is retreating.

163
00:09:02,440 --> 00:09:03,440
No.

164
00:09:03,440 --> 00:09:04,440
Lots of them are.

165
00:09:04,440 --> 00:09:08,840
He quotes a Linzen paper to claim that forcing due to CO2 is 1.135 watts per square metre.

166
00:09:08,840 --> 00:09:11,200
Linzen's paper shows forcing is three times higher.

167
00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:12,920
He confuses forcing with sensitivity.

168
00:09:12,920 --> 00:09:17,320
He says Dr Pinker's research shows that a loss of cloud cover is responsible for recent

169
00:09:17,320 --> 00:09:18,320
warming.

170
00:09:18,320 --> 00:09:19,520
She says it shows no such thing.

171
00:09:19,520 --> 00:09:24,040
He misquotes Kevin Tremburth, Justice Burton, Murari Lal and Sir John Houghton.

172
00:09:24,040 --> 00:09:27,320
He says planets with a high albedo are cooler than planets with a low albedo.

173
00:09:27,320 --> 00:09:28,320
Wrong.

174
00:09:28,320 --> 00:09:31,480
And in the video you're looking at we've seen that he got Scafetta's paper wrong and he

175
00:09:31,480 --> 00:09:33,040
got Solanki's paper wrong.

176
00:09:33,040 --> 00:09:35,360
He says some planets are warming because of the sun.

177
00:09:35,360 --> 00:09:36,360
No they're not.

178
00:09:36,360 --> 00:09:39,880
And he said the International Astronomical Union has declared that the sun's responsible

179
00:09:39,880 --> 00:09:41,720
for recent warming.

180
00:09:41,720 --> 00:09:42,720
It didn't.

181
00:09:42,720 --> 00:09:45,240
Well how are you Lord Melvray?

182
00:09:45,240 --> 00:09:46,840
How are you then?

183
00:09:46,840 --> 00:09:47,840
Alright mate?

184
00:09:48,160 --> 00:09:51,120
How's me old bucker?

185
00:09:51,120 --> 00:09:55,160
I don't have a degree in mathematics from a Russell Group University but I'd say that's

186
00:09:55,160 --> 00:09:57,300
more than a couple of mistakes.

187
00:09:57,300 --> 00:10:01,920
And these aren't just minor nit-picked errors, these are the most egregious falsehoods that

188
00:10:01,920 --> 00:10:05,640
make up Moncton's entire case against climate science.

189
00:10:05,640 --> 00:10:09,200
These are the things Moncton insists the scientists have got wrong.

190
00:10:09,200 --> 00:10:14,480
Why do those who are peddling this threat have to lie?

191
00:10:14,480 --> 00:10:16,480
Stop telling lies.

192
00:10:16,480 --> 00:10:20,720
So however many lies are uttered.

193
00:10:20,720 --> 00:10:25,240
But it turns out he's the one that got things wrong, so much so that it would probably be

194
00:10:25,240 --> 00:10:28,500
easier to find things he actually got right.

195
00:10:28,500 --> 00:10:31,200
So I'll extend that challenge to Moncton fans.

196
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:34,000
Find something that Moncton managed to get right.

197
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:38,720
Not the dates of papers or correctly identifying the names of the towns where he was speaking,

198
00:10:38,720 --> 00:10:43,120
but something that contradicts climate scientists who conclude that the earth is warming and

199
00:10:43,120 --> 00:10:46,360
that carbon dioxide is largely responsible.

200
00:10:46,360 --> 00:10:51,640
But please, before you simply copy and paste a Moncton claim, do something you might never

201
00:10:51,640 --> 00:10:53,300
have done before.

202
00:10:53,300 --> 00:10:54,300
Check it.

203
00:10:54,300 --> 00:10:57,560
If he doesn't give a source, write and ask him for his source.

204
00:10:57,560 --> 00:10:59,280
Then check that.

205
00:10:59,280 --> 00:11:01,200
You're allowed to cheat, by the way.

206
00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:06,240
Check other sites that debunk Moncton's claims, like John Abraham's website and Peter Sinclair's

207
00:11:06,240 --> 00:11:08,880
excellent video series on YouTube.

208
00:11:08,880 --> 00:11:11,120
And check their sources too.

209
00:11:11,120 --> 00:11:15,800
I started this Moncton Buncombe series by asking why people believe him.

210
00:11:15,800 --> 00:11:21,320
And after watching hours of Moncton presentations, I can't understand why anybody who's sceptical

211
00:11:21,320 --> 00:11:22,880
would believe him.

212
00:11:22,880 --> 00:11:27,640
As we've seen, he clearly doesn't know that much basic climatology, he gets his calculations

213
00:11:27,640 --> 00:11:32,560
hopelessly wrong, he misunderstands or doesn't properly read most of the scientific papers

214
00:11:32,560 --> 00:11:36,340
he quotes, and he continually contradicts himself.

215
00:11:36,340 --> 00:11:39,280
But we're not dealing with an audience full of sceptics.

216
00:11:39,280 --> 00:11:42,880
We're dealing for the most part with people who are willing to cheer anyone who echoes

217
00:11:42,880 --> 00:11:46,160
their own beliefs loudly and confidently enough.

218
00:11:46,160 --> 00:11:49,560
Ironically, these people like to call themselves sceptics.

219
00:11:49,560 --> 00:11:53,640
Sorry guys, but being a sceptic means you check what you're told.

220
00:11:53,640 --> 00:11:58,440
It doesn't mean you believe what someone says simply because he's got a title, or he sounds

221
00:11:58,440 --> 00:12:01,800
confident of his facts, or he's good at Latin.

222
00:12:01,800 --> 00:12:05,340
So if you want to be a real sceptic, take up my challenge.

223
00:12:05,340 --> 00:12:10,160
Check what Moncton says, check his sources, and find something he actually managed to

224
00:12:10,160 --> 00:12:10,880
get right.
