00:00.000 --> 00:08.880
If Greenland broke up and melted, or if half of Greenland and half of West Antarctica broke

00:08.880 --> 00:14.000
up and melted, this is what would happen to the sea level in Florida.

00:14.000 --> 00:18.400
Well yes, but it's rather like saying that if the Rockefeller Center turned into a banana

00:18.400 --> 00:22.080
split, ice cream would melt all over Fifth Avenue.

00:22.080 --> 00:26.040
The crucial question is, how likely is that to happen?

00:26.040 --> 00:29.600
I covered the science of climate change earlier in this series.

00:29.600 --> 00:33.920
This video will continue our look at climate change urban myths.

00:33.920 --> 00:39.260
So let's look more closely at Al Gore's claim about a 20-foot rise in sea levels.

00:39.260 --> 00:42.520
The important word here, of course, is if.

00:42.520 --> 00:44.640
Gore isn't exactly lying.

00:44.640 --> 00:49.520
If these ice sheets melted, then yes, we could get a 20-foot rise in sea levels, although

00:49.520 --> 00:52.900
more recent research suggests the figure would be less.

00:52.900 --> 00:56.820
But no climate scientist is saying it'll happen any time soon.

00:56.820 --> 01:01.100
At current warming rates, the data show it'll take at least a thousand years for the Greenland

01:01.100 --> 01:07.380
ice sheet to completely melt, and thousands more for the West Antarctic ice sheet to melt.

01:07.380 --> 01:09.700
So what do the experts say?

01:09.700 --> 01:14.660
Climate scientists agree that sea levels have been rising by about 1.8 mm a year for the

01:14.660 --> 01:16.620
past half century.

01:16.620 --> 01:22.580
But that rate of increase has accelerated since 1993 to around 3 mm a year.

01:22.980 --> 01:26.340
Research shows that melting ice is not the main contributor.

01:26.340 --> 01:30.940
More than half the rise is due to a principle of physics called thermal expansion.

01:30.940 --> 01:36.240
The world's oceans have been absorbing around 80% of global warming over the past few decades,

01:36.240 --> 01:39.040
and as they warm up, they expand.

01:39.040 --> 01:43.940
New evidence suggests that glacial melt will become an increasingly important factor.

01:43.940 --> 01:49.900
At the Climate Change Congress in March 2009, evidence was presented by a number of researchers

01:49.900 --> 01:54.940
suggesting that the rise by the end of this century will be at least a metre.

01:54.940 --> 01:59.580
That's not without consequences, of course, but it's a long way short of the 6 metres,

01:59.580 --> 02:02.900
the 20 feet, described by Al Gore.

02:02.900 --> 02:07.140
I've already looked at another urban myth spawned by an inconvenient truth in the first

02:07.140 --> 02:12.380
video, the muddying of the relationship between carbon dioxide concentrations and temperatures

02:12.380 --> 02:14.140
during interglacials.

02:14.140 --> 02:18.020
The answer to Gore's clever wordplay should have been a documentary that corrected the

02:18.020 --> 02:23.100
errors and more accurately reflected the conclusions of climate scientists based on

02:23.100 --> 02:24.940
research and evidence.

02:24.940 --> 02:27.900
Instead, we got this.

02:27.900 --> 02:33.040
The Great Global Warming Swindle was written, directed and narrated by Martin Durkin, who

02:33.040 --> 02:34.980
has a degree in geophysics.

02:34.980 --> 02:37.500
Sorry, not geophysics.

02:37.500 --> 02:43.180
He has a degree in ancient and medieval history and a career as a financial journalist.

02:43.180 --> 02:48.260
And yes, Durkin shows very convincingly that man-made gases are not responsible for climate

02:48.260 --> 02:49.260
change.

02:49.260 --> 02:54.900
So Professor Fries Christiansen and his colleagues examined 400 years of astronomical records

02:54.900 --> 02:59.420
to compare sunspot activity against temperature variation.

02:59.420 --> 03:04.200
Durkin attributes this graph to Henrik Spensmark and Egil Fries Christiansen, whose work I

03:04.200 --> 03:06.540
looked at in the second video.

03:06.540 --> 03:09.500
But in fact, it's not their graph.

03:09.500 --> 03:13.940
Durkin had this graph drawn up himself, and he's accused of fabricating the data on which

03:13.940 --> 03:15.780
it was based.

03:15.780 --> 03:20.700
The person who accused him of fabricating wasn't Al Gore or even a proponent of anthropogenic

03:20.700 --> 03:22.140
climate change.

03:22.140 --> 03:28.540
It was the man whose graph Durkin is claiming to reproduce, Egil Fries Christiansen himself.

03:28.540 --> 03:32.300
In a joint statement after watching the programme, Fries Christiansen wrote,

03:32.300 --> 03:37.140
We have reason to believe that parts of the graph were made up of fabricated data that

03:37.140 --> 03:39.740
were presented as genuine.

03:39.740 --> 03:44.380
And he criticised Durkin for attributing this conclusion to his research.

03:44.380 --> 03:49.980
It was the sun, it seemed, not carbon dioxide or anything else, that was driving changes

03:49.980 --> 03:51.140
in the climate.

03:51.140 --> 03:56.220
Fries Christiansen called this an overstatement that is not supported by the graph, interview

03:56.220 --> 04:02.140
statements by Fries Christiansen in the programme, nor any related scientific literature.

04:02.140 --> 04:06.300
Now Fries Christiansen was interviewed by Durkin and appeared in the programme.

04:06.300 --> 04:10.860
He's a well-known sceptic who doesn't think that man-made gases are largely responsible

04:10.860 --> 04:12.460
for climate change.

04:12.460 --> 04:17.420
So when he complains that Durkin is fraudulently distorting the case for anthropogenic climate

04:17.420 --> 04:23.580
change, even die-hard fans of the great global warming swindle have to listen.

04:23.580 --> 04:27.220
This wasn't the only graph Durkin tampered with, here's another.

04:27.220 --> 04:32.900
Most of the rise in temperature occurred before 1940, during a period when industrial production

04:32.900 --> 04:34.700
was relatively insignificant.

04:34.700 --> 04:39.100
And the graph, made by NASA, clearly supports Durkin's assertion.

04:39.100 --> 04:44.220
As you can see, most of the warming we've experienced over the last 120 years did indeed

04:44.220 --> 04:51.060
occur before 1940, when much less industrial carbon dioxide was being pumped into the air.

04:51.060 --> 04:57.740
So why do climate scientists insist that most of the warming has occurred since 1975?

04:57.740 --> 05:00.980
Because the graph is a complete fabrication.

05:00.980 --> 05:03.860
NASA never produced it, Durkin did.

05:03.860 --> 05:08.540
And since Durkin wanted us to believe that most warming took place before 1940, that's

05:08.540 --> 05:11.460
exactly what he had drawn.

05:11.460 --> 05:15.980
Here's NASA's actual graph of average global temperatures for the same period.

05:15.980 --> 05:20.180
As it shows, Durkin's assertion that most of the rise in temperature occurred before

05:20.180 --> 05:22.980
1940 is fallacious.

05:22.980 --> 05:25.740
Let's superimpose one graph over the other.

05:25.740 --> 05:30.300
If Durkin really did use NASA's graph as his source, then we can see how radically he's

05:30.300 --> 05:31.920
altered it.

05:31.920 --> 05:37.520
Durkin turns the variations in temperature before 1920 into an almost uninterrupted warming

05:37.520 --> 05:38.520
trend.

05:38.520 --> 05:43.200
And he drastically increases the warming trend prior to 1940.

05:43.200 --> 05:52.680
Frisk Christensen was right to cry fraud, and he wasn't the only interviewee to do so.

05:52.680 --> 05:57.000
After the great global warming swindle was broadcast, Wunsch wrote a furious letter to

05:57.000 --> 05:58.000
WAG-TV.

05:58.000 --> 06:03.800
I'm sure in explaining that a warming ocean could expel more carbon dioxide than it absorbs,

06:03.800 --> 06:09.800
he wrote, thus exacerbating the greenhouse gas buildup in the atmosphere and hence worrisome.

06:09.800 --> 06:15.040
It was used in the film through its context to imply that CO2 is all natural, coming from

06:15.040 --> 06:18.860
the ocean, and that therefore the human element is irrelevant.

06:18.860 --> 06:24.920
This use of my remarks, which are literally what I said, comes close to fraud.

06:24.920 --> 06:29.920
So now let's wade through all the fabricated graphs and the emotional appeals and the fallacies

06:29.920 --> 06:35.080
and the exaggerations in both movies, and let's find out what the research shows.

06:35.080 --> 06:40.840
Why do we suppose that carbon dioxide is responsible for our changing climate?

06:40.840 --> 06:45.960
CO2 forms only a very small part of the Earth's atmosphere.

06:45.960 --> 06:52.240
In fact, we measure changes in the level of atmospheric CO2 in tens of parts per million.

06:52.240 --> 06:56.800
To answer that question, Durkin could have read some of the hundreds of scientific papers

06:56.800 --> 07:00.500
based on research that shows exactly why.

07:00.500 --> 07:03.680
Or he could have asked a climatologist who could have told him.

07:03.680 --> 07:07.600
Or Durkin could have picked up a science book from the local library, or he could have drunk

07:07.600 --> 07:12.960
water laced with a teeny tiny amount of strychnine to see what effect one tiny substance has

07:12.960 --> 07:14.700
on his body.

07:14.700 --> 07:17.600
Tiny amounts of things can have big effects.

07:17.600 --> 07:22.120
There's far less ozone in the atmosphere than carbon dioxide, and yet it protects the Earth

07:22.120 --> 07:24.440
from ultraviolet radiation.

07:24.440 --> 07:29.600
So the fact that carbon dioxide makes up a very small part of our atmosphere is immaterial.

07:29.600 --> 07:34.520
The reason it's important to climate change is that it absorbs solar radiation that other

07:34.520 --> 07:38.740
greenhouse gases, such as water vapour, let through.

07:38.740 --> 07:41.760
This was explained in the second video of this series.

07:41.760 --> 07:43.840
So if you want to know how it works, take a look.

07:43.840 --> 07:51.520
A couple of years ago in Europe they had that massive heat wave that killed 35,000 people.

07:52.520 --> 07:56.520
Let me explain how climatologists derive their temperature data.

07:56.520 --> 08:00.640
They look out of the window, and if it's unusually hot, they conclude that the Earth must be

08:00.640 --> 08:01.900
heating up.

08:01.900 --> 08:06.480
If it's unusually cold, they conclude the Earth must be cooling down.

08:06.480 --> 08:08.800
If that sounds stupid, you're right.

08:08.800 --> 08:12.600
But that's exactly how a lot of amateurs evaluate the evidence.

08:12.600 --> 08:17.040
A heat wave in Europe in a single year could be due to a number of factors that have nothing

08:17.040 --> 08:19.660
to do with climate change.

08:19.700 --> 08:22.140
Amateur sceptics do exactly the same thing.

08:22.140 --> 08:26.580
When it snowed in Malibu and Las Vegas, amateurs leapt to the conclusion that the Earth must

08:26.580 --> 08:28.380
be cooling.

08:28.380 --> 08:30.700
So what do the experts say?

08:30.700 --> 08:35.100
Well to properly assess the global climate, they don't just take readings in Malibu, Las

08:35.100 --> 08:36.660
Vegas and Paris.

08:36.660 --> 08:40.740
They monitor temperatures all over the world and take an average.

08:40.740 --> 08:45.860
It may have been snowing in Malibu in December 2008, but on the other side of the world,

08:45.860 --> 08:51.020
Moscow was getting very little snow and recording record high winter temperatures.

08:51.020 --> 08:55.220
You can't look out of your window in Malibu and conclude that the world's cooling any

08:55.220 --> 09:00.860
more than you can look out of your window in Moscow and conclude that it's warming.

09:00.860 --> 09:03.380
Climatologists also do something called smoothing.

09:03.380 --> 09:07.820
Weather cycles and solar cycles affect the Earth's temperature year by year, so temperature

09:07.820 --> 09:11.780
data are averaged out over periods of five years or so.

09:11.780 --> 09:17.780
After all, Europe might face a heatwave one year, but it could be cooling the next.

09:17.780 --> 09:21.620
I have to apologise for the fact that what was supposed to be a couple of videos looking

09:21.620 --> 09:26.320
at the science of climate change has turned into a rather long series debunking all the

09:26.320 --> 09:29.780
mythological crap that's been built up around it.

09:29.780 --> 09:34.540
But every time I turn over a rock, it seems like a new piece of junk science crawls out

09:34.540 --> 09:36.300
from underneath it.

09:36.300 --> 09:41.220
An Inconvenient Truth and the Great Global Warming Swindle are both icons in the public

09:41.220 --> 09:45.020
debate, the amateur debate, about climate change.

09:45.020 --> 09:46.520
And both are flawed.

09:46.520 --> 09:51.180
I'll refer back to them over the next couple of videos as I look at more of the urban myths

09:51.180 --> 09:51.940
they've spawned.
