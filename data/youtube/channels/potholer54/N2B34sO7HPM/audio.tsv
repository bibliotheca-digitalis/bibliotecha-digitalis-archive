0	8880	If Greenland broke up and melted, or if half of Greenland and half of West Antarctica broke
8880	14000	up and melted, this is what would happen to the sea level in Florida.
14000	18400	Well yes, but it's rather like saying that if the Rockefeller Center turned into a banana
18400	22080	split, ice cream would melt all over Fifth Avenue.
22080	26040	The crucial question is, how likely is that to happen?
26040	29600	I covered the science of climate change earlier in this series.
29600	33920	This video will continue our look at climate change urban myths.
33920	39260	So let's look more closely at Al Gore's claim about a 20-foot rise in sea levels.
39260	42520	The important word here, of course, is if.
42520	44640	Gore isn't exactly lying.
44640	49520	If these ice sheets melted, then yes, we could get a 20-foot rise in sea levels, although
49520	52900	more recent research suggests the figure would be less.
52900	56820	But no climate scientist is saying it'll happen any time soon.
56820	61100	At current warming rates, the data show it'll take at least a thousand years for the Greenland
61100	67380	ice sheet to completely melt, and thousands more for the West Antarctic ice sheet to melt.
67380	69700	So what do the experts say?
69700	74660	Climate scientists agree that sea levels have been rising by about 1.8 mm a year for the
74660	76620	past half century.
76620	82580	But that rate of increase has accelerated since 1993 to around 3 mm a year.
82980	86340	Research shows that melting ice is not the main contributor.
86340	90940	More than half the rise is due to a principle of physics called thermal expansion.
90940	96240	The world's oceans have been absorbing around 80% of global warming over the past few decades,
96240	99040	and as they warm up, they expand.
99040	103940	New evidence suggests that glacial melt will become an increasingly important factor.
103940	109900	At the Climate Change Congress in March 2009, evidence was presented by a number of researchers
109900	114940	suggesting that the rise by the end of this century will be at least a metre.
114940	119580	That's not without consequences, of course, but it's a long way short of the 6 metres,
119580	122900	the 20 feet, described by Al Gore.
122900	127140	I've already looked at another urban myth spawned by an inconvenient truth in the first
127140	132380	video, the muddying of the relationship between carbon dioxide concentrations and temperatures
132380	134140	during interglacials.
134140	138020	The answer to Gore's clever wordplay should have been a documentary that corrected the
138020	143100	errors and more accurately reflected the conclusions of climate scientists based on
143100	144940	research and evidence.
144940	147900	Instead, we got this.
147900	153040	The Great Global Warming Swindle was written, directed and narrated by Martin Durkin, who
153040	154980	has a degree in geophysics.
154980	157500	Sorry, not geophysics.
157500	163180	He has a degree in ancient and medieval history and a career as a financial journalist.
163180	168260	And yes, Durkin shows very convincingly that man-made gases are not responsible for climate
168260	169260	change.
169260	174900	So Professor Fries Christiansen and his colleagues examined 400 years of astronomical records
174900	179420	to compare sunspot activity against temperature variation.
179420	184200	Durkin attributes this graph to Henrik Spensmark and Egil Fries Christiansen, whose work I
184200	186540	looked at in the second video.
186540	189500	But in fact, it's not their graph.
189500	193940	Durkin had this graph drawn up himself, and he's accused of fabricating the data on which
193940	195780	it was based.
195780	200700	The person who accused him of fabricating wasn't Al Gore or even a proponent of anthropogenic
200700	202140	climate change.
202140	208540	It was the man whose graph Durkin is claiming to reproduce, Egil Fries Christiansen himself.
208540	212300	In a joint statement after watching the programme, Fries Christiansen wrote,
212300	217140	We have reason to believe that parts of the graph were made up of fabricated data that
217140	219740	were presented as genuine.
219740	224380	And he criticised Durkin for attributing this conclusion to his research.
224380	229980	It was the sun, it seemed, not carbon dioxide or anything else, that was driving changes
229980	231140	in the climate.
231140	236220	Fries Christiansen called this an overstatement that is not supported by the graph, interview
236220	242140	statements by Fries Christiansen in the programme, nor any related scientific literature.
242140	246300	Now Fries Christiansen was interviewed by Durkin and appeared in the programme.
246300	250860	He's a well-known sceptic who doesn't think that man-made gases are largely responsible
250860	252460	for climate change.
252460	257420	So when he complains that Durkin is fraudulently distorting the case for anthropogenic climate
257420	263580	change, even die-hard fans of the great global warming swindle have to listen.
263580	267220	This wasn't the only graph Durkin tampered with, here's another.
267220	272900	Most of the rise in temperature occurred before 1940, during a period when industrial production
272900	274700	was relatively insignificant.
274700	279100	And the graph, made by NASA, clearly supports Durkin's assertion.
279100	284220	As you can see, most of the warming we've experienced over the last 120 years did indeed
284220	291060	occur before 1940, when much less industrial carbon dioxide was being pumped into the air.
291060	297740	So why do climate scientists insist that most of the warming has occurred since 1975?
297740	300980	Because the graph is a complete fabrication.
300980	303860	NASA never produced it, Durkin did.
303860	308540	And since Durkin wanted us to believe that most warming took place before 1940, that's
308540	311460	exactly what he had drawn.
311460	315980	Here's NASA's actual graph of average global temperatures for the same period.
315980	320180	As it shows, Durkin's assertion that most of the rise in temperature occurred before
320180	322980	1940 is fallacious.
322980	325740	Let's superimpose one graph over the other.
325740	330300	If Durkin really did use NASA's graph as his source, then we can see how radically he's
330300	331920	altered it.
331920	337520	Durkin turns the variations in temperature before 1920 into an almost uninterrupted warming
337520	338520	trend.
338520	343200	And he drastically increases the warming trend prior to 1940.
343200	352680	Frisk Christensen was right to cry fraud, and he wasn't the only interviewee to do so.
352680	357000	After the great global warming swindle was broadcast, Wunsch wrote a furious letter to
357000	358000	WAG-TV.
358000	363800	I'm sure in explaining that a warming ocean could expel more carbon dioxide than it absorbs,
363800	369800	he wrote, thus exacerbating the greenhouse gas buildup in the atmosphere and hence worrisome.
369800	375040	It was used in the film through its context to imply that CO2 is all natural, coming from
375040	378860	the ocean, and that therefore the human element is irrelevant.
378860	384920	This use of my remarks, which are literally what I said, comes close to fraud.
384920	389920	So now let's wade through all the fabricated graphs and the emotional appeals and the fallacies
389920	395080	and the exaggerations in both movies, and let's find out what the research shows.
395080	400840	Why do we suppose that carbon dioxide is responsible for our changing climate?
400840	405960	CO2 forms only a very small part of the Earth's atmosphere.
405960	412240	In fact, we measure changes in the level of atmospheric CO2 in tens of parts per million.
412240	416800	To answer that question, Durkin could have read some of the hundreds of scientific papers
416800	420500	based on research that shows exactly why.
420500	423680	Or he could have asked a climatologist who could have told him.
423680	427600	Or Durkin could have picked up a science book from the local library, or he could have drunk
427600	432960	water laced with a teeny tiny amount of strychnine to see what effect one tiny substance has
432960	434700	on his body.
434700	437600	Tiny amounts of things can have big effects.
437600	442120	There's far less ozone in the atmosphere than carbon dioxide, and yet it protects the Earth
442120	444440	from ultraviolet radiation.
444440	449600	So the fact that carbon dioxide makes up a very small part of our atmosphere is immaterial.
449600	454520	The reason it's important to climate change is that it absorbs solar radiation that other
454520	458740	greenhouse gases, such as water vapour, let through.
458740	461760	This was explained in the second video of this series.
461760	463840	So if you want to know how it works, take a look.
463840	471520	A couple of years ago in Europe they had that massive heat wave that killed 35,000 people.
472520	476520	Let me explain how climatologists derive their temperature data.
476520	480640	They look out of the window, and if it's unusually hot, they conclude that the Earth must be
480640	481900	heating up.
481900	486480	If it's unusually cold, they conclude the Earth must be cooling down.
486480	488800	If that sounds stupid, you're right.
488800	492600	But that's exactly how a lot of amateurs evaluate the evidence.
492600	497040	A heat wave in Europe in a single year could be due to a number of factors that have nothing
497040	499660	to do with climate change.
499700	502140	Amateur sceptics do exactly the same thing.
502140	506580	When it snowed in Malibu and Las Vegas, amateurs leapt to the conclusion that the Earth must
506580	508380	be cooling.
508380	510700	So what do the experts say?
510700	515100	Well to properly assess the global climate, they don't just take readings in Malibu, Las
515100	516660	Vegas and Paris.
516660	520740	They monitor temperatures all over the world and take an average.
520740	525860	It may have been snowing in Malibu in December 2008, but on the other side of the world,
525860	531020	Moscow was getting very little snow and recording record high winter temperatures.
531020	535220	You can't look out of your window in Malibu and conclude that the world's cooling any
535220	540860	more than you can look out of your window in Moscow and conclude that it's warming.
540860	543380	Climatologists also do something called smoothing.
543380	547820	Weather cycles and solar cycles affect the Earth's temperature year by year, so temperature
547820	551780	data are averaged out over periods of five years or so.
551780	557780	After all, Europe might face a heatwave one year, but it could be cooling the next.
557780	561620	I have to apologise for the fact that what was supposed to be a couple of videos looking
561620	566320	at the science of climate change has turned into a rather long series debunking all the
566320	569780	mythological crap that's been built up around it.
569780	574540	But every time I turn over a rock, it seems like a new piece of junk science crawls out
574540	576300	from underneath it.
576300	581220	An Inconvenient Truth and the Great Global Warming Swindle are both icons in the public
581220	585020	debate, the amateur debate, about climate change.
585020	586520	And both are flawed.
586520	591180	I'll refer back to them over the next couple of videos as I look at more of the urban myths
591180	591940	they've spawned.
