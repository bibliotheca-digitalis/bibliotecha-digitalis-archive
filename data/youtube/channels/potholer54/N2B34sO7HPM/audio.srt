1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,880
If Greenland broke up and melted, or if half of Greenland and half of West Antarctica broke

2
00:00:08,880 --> 00:00:14,000
up and melted, this is what would happen to the sea level in Florida.

3
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:18,400
Well yes, but it's rather like saying that if the Rockefeller Center turned into a banana

4
00:00:18,400 --> 00:00:22,080
split, ice cream would melt all over Fifth Avenue.

5
00:00:22,080 --> 00:00:26,040
The crucial question is, how likely is that to happen?

6
00:00:26,040 --> 00:00:29,600
I covered the science of climate change earlier in this series.

7
00:00:29,600 --> 00:00:33,920
This video will continue our look at climate change urban myths.

8
00:00:33,920 --> 00:00:39,260
So let's look more closely at Al Gore's claim about a 20-foot rise in sea levels.

9
00:00:39,260 --> 00:00:42,520
The important word here, of course, is if.

10
00:00:42,520 --> 00:00:44,640
Gore isn't exactly lying.

11
00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:49,520
If these ice sheets melted, then yes, we could get a 20-foot rise in sea levels, although

12
00:00:49,520 --> 00:00:52,900
more recent research suggests the figure would be less.

13
00:00:52,900 --> 00:00:56,820
But no climate scientist is saying it'll happen any time soon.

14
00:00:56,820 --> 00:01:01,100
At current warming rates, the data show it'll take at least a thousand years for the Greenland

15
00:01:01,100 --> 00:01:07,380
ice sheet to completely melt, and thousands more for the West Antarctic ice sheet to melt.

16
00:01:07,380 --> 00:01:09,700
So what do the experts say?

17
00:01:09,700 --> 00:01:14,660
Climate scientists agree that sea levels have been rising by about 1.8 mm a year for the

18
00:01:14,660 --> 00:01:16,620
past half century.

19
00:01:16,620 --> 00:01:22,580
But that rate of increase has accelerated since 1993 to around 3 mm a year.

20
00:01:22,980 --> 00:01:26,340
Research shows that melting ice is not the main contributor.

21
00:01:26,340 --> 00:01:30,940
More than half the rise is due to a principle of physics called thermal expansion.

22
00:01:30,940 --> 00:01:36,240
The world's oceans have been absorbing around 80% of global warming over the past few decades,

23
00:01:36,240 --> 00:01:39,040
and as they warm up, they expand.

24
00:01:39,040 --> 00:01:43,940
New evidence suggests that glacial melt will become an increasingly important factor.

25
00:01:43,940 --> 00:01:49,900
At the Climate Change Congress in March 2009, evidence was presented by a number of researchers

26
00:01:49,900 --> 00:01:54,940
suggesting that the rise by the end of this century will be at least a metre.

27
00:01:54,940 --> 00:01:59,580
That's not without consequences, of course, but it's a long way short of the 6 metres,

28
00:01:59,580 --> 00:02:02,900
the 20 feet, described by Al Gore.

29
00:02:02,900 --> 00:02:07,140
I've already looked at another urban myth spawned by an inconvenient truth in the first

30
00:02:07,140 --> 00:02:12,380
video, the muddying of the relationship between carbon dioxide concentrations and temperatures

31
00:02:12,380 --> 00:02:14,140
during interglacials.

32
00:02:14,140 --> 00:02:18,020
The answer to Gore's clever wordplay should have been a documentary that corrected the

33
00:02:18,020 --> 00:02:23,100
errors and more accurately reflected the conclusions of climate scientists based on

34
00:02:23,100 --> 00:02:24,940
research and evidence.

35
00:02:24,940 --> 00:02:27,900
Instead, we got this.

36
00:02:27,900 --> 00:02:33,040
The Great Global Warming Swindle was written, directed and narrated by Martin Durkin, who

37
00:02:33,040 --> 00:02:34,980
has a degree in geophysics.

38
00:02:34,980 --> 00:02:37,500
Sorry, not geophysics.

39
00:02:37,500 --> 00:02:43,180
He has a degree in ancient and medieval history and a career as a financial journalist.

40
00:02:43,180 --> 00:02:48,260
And yes, Durkin shows very convincingly that man-made gases are not responsible for climate

41
00:02:48,260 --> 00:02:49,260
change.

42
00:02:49,260 --> 00:02:54,900
So Professor Fries Christiansen and his colleagues examined 400 years of astronomical records

43
00:02:54,900 --> 00:02:59,420
to compare sunspot activity against temperature variation.

44
00:02:59,420 --> 00:03:04,200
Durkin attributes this graph to Henrik Spensmark and Egil Fries Christiansen, whose work I

45
00:03:04,200 --> 00:03:06,540
looked at in the second video.

46
00:03:06,540 --> 00:03:09,500
But in fact, it's not their graph.

47
00:03:09,500 --> 00:03:13,940
Durkin had this graph drawn up himself, and he's accused of fabricating the data on which

48
00:03:13,940 --> 00:03:15,780
it was based.

49
00:03:15,780 --> 00:03:20,700
The person who accused him of fabricating wasn't Al Gore or even a proponent of anthropogenic

50
00:03:20,700 --> 00:03:22,140
climate change.

51
00:03:22,140 --> 00:03:28,540
It was the man whose graph Durkin is claiming to reproduce, Egil Fries Christiansen himself.

52
00:03:28,540 --> 00:03:32,300
In a joint statement after watching the programme, Fries Christiansen wrote,

53
00:03:32,300 --> 00:03:37,140
We have reason to believe that parts of the graph were made up of fabricated data that

54
00:03:37,140 --> 00:03:39,740
were presented as genuine.

55
00:03:39,740 --> 00:03:44,380
And he criticised Durkin for attributing this conclusion to his research.

56
00:03:44,380 --> 00:03:49,980
It was the sun, it seemed, not carbon dioxide or anything else, that was driving changes

57
00:03:49,980 --> 00:03:51,140
in the climate.

58
00:03:51,140 --> 00:03:56,220
Fries Christiansen called this an overstatement that is not supported by the graph, interview

59
00:03:56,220 --> 00:04:02,140
statements by Fries Christiansen in the programme, nor any related scientific literature.

60
00:04:02,140 --> 00:04:06,300
Now Fries Christiansen was interviewed by Durkin and appeared in the programme.

61
00:04:06,300 --> 00:04:10,860
He's a well-known sceptic who doesn't think that man-made gases are largely responsible

62
00:04:10,860 --> 00:04:12,460
for climate change.

63
00:04:12,460 --> 00:04:17,420
So when he complains that Durkin is fraudulently distorting the case for anthropogenic climate

64
00:04:17,420 --> 00:04:23,580
change, even die-hard fans of the great global warming swindle have to listen.

65
00:04:23,580 --> 00:04:27,220
This wasn't the only graph Durkin tampered with, here's another.

66
00:04:27,220 --> 00:04:32,900
Most of the rise in temperature occurred before 1940, during a period when industrial production

67
00:04:32,900 --> 00:04:34,700
was relatively insignificant.

68
00:04:34,700 --> 00:04:39,100
And the graph, made by NASA, clearly supports Durkin's assertion.

69
00:04:39,100 --> 00:04:44,220
As you can see, most of the warming we've experienced over the last 120 years did indeed

70
00:04:44,220 --> 00:04:51,060
occur before 1940, when much less industrial carbon dioxide was being pumped into the air.

71
00:04:51,060 --> 00:04:57,740
So why do climate scientists insist that most of the warming has occurred since 1975?

72
00:04:57,740 --> 00:05:00,980
Because the graph is a complete fabrication.

73
00:05:00,980 --> 00:05:03,860
NASA never produced it, Durkin did.

74
00:05:03,860 --> 00:05:08,540
And since Durkin wanted us to believe that most warming took place before 1940, that's

75
00:05:08,540 --> 00:05:11,460
exactly what he had drawn.

76
00:05:11,460 --> 00:05:15,980
Here's NASA's actual graph of average global temperatures for the same period.

77
00:05:15,980 --> 00:05:20,180
As it shows, Durkin's assertion that most of the rise in temperature occurred before

78
00:05:20,180 --> 00:05:22,980
1940 is fallacious.

79
00:05:22,980 --> 00:05:25,740
Let's superimpose one graph over the other.

80
00:05:25,740 --> 00:05:30,300
If Durkin really did use NASA's graph as his source, then we can see how radically he's

81
00:05:30,300 --> 00:05:31,920
altered it.

82
00:05:31,920 --> 00:05:37,520
Durkin turns the variations in temperature before 1920 into an almost uninterrupted warming

83
00:05:37,520 --> 00:05:38,520
trend.

84
00:05:38,520 --> 00:05:43,200
And he drastically increases the warming trend prior to 1940.

85
00:05:43,200 --> 00:05:52,680
Frisk Christensen was right to cry fraud, and he wasn't the only interviewee to do so.

86
00:05:52,680 --> 00:05:57,000
After the great global warming swindle was broadcast, Wunsch wrote a furious letter to

87
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:58,000
WAG-TV.

88
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:03,800
I'm sure in explaining that a warming ocean could expel more carbon dioxide than it absorbs,

89
00:06:03,800 --> 00:06:09,800
he wrote, thus exacerbating the greenhouse gas buildup in the atmosphere and hence worrisome.

90
00:06:09,800 --> 00:06:15,040
It was used in the film through its context to imply that CO2 is all natural, coming from

91
00:06:15,040 --> 00:06:18,860
the ocean, and that therefore the human element is irrelevant.

92
00:06:18,860 --> 00:06:24,920
This use of my remarks, which are literally what I said, comes close to fraud.

93
00:06:24,920 --> 00:06:29,920
So now let's wade through all the fabricated graphs and the emotional appeals and the fallacies

94
00:06:29,920 --> 00:06:35,080
and the exaggerations in both movies, and let's find out what the research shows.

95
00:06:35,080 --> 00:06:40,840
Why do we suppose that carbon dioxide is responsible for our changing climate?

96
00:06:40,840 --> 00:06:45,960
CO2 forms only a very small part of the Earth's atmosphere.

97
00:06:45,960 --> 00:06:52,240
In fact, we measure changes in the level of atmospheric CO2 in tens of parts per million.

98
00:06:52,240 --> 00:06:56,800
To answer that question, Durkin could have read some of the hundreds of scientific papers

99
00:06:56,800 --> 00:07:00,500
based on research that shows exactly why.

100
00:07:00,500 --> 00:07:03,680
Or he could have asked a climatologist who could have told him.

101
00:07:03,680 --> 00:07:07,600
Or Durkin could have picked up a science book from the local library, or he could have drunk

102
00:07:07,600 --> 00:07:12,960
water laced with a teeny tiny amount of strychnine to see what effect one tiny substance has

103
00:07:12,960 --> 00:07:14,700
on his body.

104
00:07:14,700 --> 00:07:17,600
Tiny amounts of things can have big effects.

105
00:07:17,600 --> 00:07:22,120
There's far less ozone in the atmosphere than carbon dioxide, and yet it protects the Earth

106
00:07:22,120 --> 00:07:24,440
from ultraviolet radiation.

107
00:07:24,440 --> 00:07:29,600
So the fact that carbon dioxide makes up a very small part of our atmosphere is immaterial.

108
00:07:29,600 --> 00:07:34,520
The reason it's important to climate change is that it absorbs solar radiation that other

109
00:07:34,520 --> 00:07:38,740
greenhouse gases, such as water vapour, let through.

110
00:07:38,740 --> 00:07:41,760
This was explained in the second video of this series.

111
00:07:41,760 --> 00:07:43,840
So if you want to know how it works, take a look.

112
00:07:43,840 --> 00:07:51,520
A couple of years ago in Europe they had that massive heat wave that killed 35,000 people.

113
00:07:52,520 --> 00:07:56,520
Let me explain how climatologists derive their temperature data.

114
00:07:56,520 --> 00:08:00,640
They look out of the window, and if it's unusually hot, they conclude that the Earth must be

115
00:08:00,640 --> 00:08:01,900
heating up.

116
00:08:01,900 --> 00:08:06,480
If it's unusually cold, they conclude the Earth must be cooling down.

117
00:08:06,480 --> 00:08:08,800
If that sounds stupid, you're right.

118
00:08:08,800 --> 00:08:12,600
But that's exactly how a lot of amateurs evaluate the evidence.

119
00:08:12,600 --> 00:08:17,040
A heat wave in Europe in a single year could be due to a number of factors that have nothing

120
00:08:17,040 --> 00:08:19,660
to do with climate change.

121
00:08:19,700 --> 00:08:22,140
Amateur sceptics do exactly the same thing.

122
00:08:22,140 --> 00:08:26,580
When it snowed in Malibu and Las Vegas, amateurs leapt to the conclusion that the Earth must

123
00:08:26,580 --> 00:08:28,380
be cooling.

124
00:08:28,380 --> 00:08:30,700
So what do the experts say?

125
00:08:30,700 --> 00:08:35,100
Well to properly assess the global climate, they don't just take readings in Malibu, Las

126
00:08:35,100 --> 00:08:36,660
Vegas and Paris.

127
00:08:36,660 --> 00:08:40,740
They monitor temperatures all over the world and take an average.

128
00:08:40,740 --> 00:08:45,860
It may have been snowing in Malibu in December 2008, but on the other side of the world,

129
00:08:45,860 --> 00:08:51,020
Moscow was getting very little snow and recording record high winter temperatures.

130
00:08:51,020 --> 00:08:55,220
You can't look out of your window in Malibu and conclude that the world's cooling any

131
00:08:55,220 --> 00:09:00,860
more than you can look out of your window in Moscow and conclude that it's warming.

132
00:09:00,860 --> 00:09:03,380
Climatologists also do something called smoothing.

133
00:09:03,380 --> 00:09:07,820
Weather cycles and solar cycles affect the Earth's temperature year by year, so temperature

134
00:09:07,820 --> 00:09:11,780
data are averaged out over periods of five years or so.

135
00:09:11,780 --> 00:09:17,780
After all, Europe might face a heatwave one year, but it could be cooling the next.

136
00:09:17,780 --> 00:09:21,620
I have to apologise for the fact that what was supposed to be a couple of videos looking

137
00:09:21,620 --> 00:09:26,320
at the science of climate change has turned into a rather long series debunking all the

138
00:09:26,320 --> 00:09:29,780
mythological crap that's been built up around it.

139
00:09:29,780 --> 00:09:34,540
But every time I turn over a rock, it seems like a new piece of junk science crawls out

140
00:09:34,540 --> 00:09:36,300
from underneath it.

141
00:09:36,300 --> 00:09:41,220
An Inconvenient Truth and the Great Global Warming Swindle are both icons in the public

142
00:09:41,220 --> 00:09:45,020
debate, the amateur debate, about climate change.

143
00:09:45,020 --> 00:09:46,520
And both are flawed.

144
00:09:46,520 --> 00:09:51,180
I'll refer back to them over the next couple of videos as I look at more of the urban myths

145
00:09:51,180 --> 00:09:51,940
they've spawned.
