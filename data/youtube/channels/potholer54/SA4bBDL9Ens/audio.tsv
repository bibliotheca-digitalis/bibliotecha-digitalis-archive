0	7000	Hehehehe, Wacky Willigis News.
30000	39560	Yes, on Wacky Willigis News we're not afraid to pick up news that's nine months old and
39560	42640	pretend it's a 2014 retrospective.
42640	46880	So did you spot the blasphemy in this Pakistan TV wedding?
46880	52120	Was it the sexual tension graphically expressed during a religious ceremony, the insulting
52120	56680	poking of the eye as if snubbing Allah, or the holding up of shoes viewed through the
56680	60640	Islamic world as a covering for the lowest form of the human anatomy?
60640	67120	Well this TV wedding was shown on Pakistan's GeoTV, so let's go to rival Ari TV for the
67120	68120	answer.
68120	70720	Yes, that's right.
70720	75760	Holding up a pair of shoes is not normally blasphemy, but it is blasphemy when the shoes
75760	79920	are held up during the playing of a traditional wedding song about the wedding of Muhammad's
79920	81240	daughter.
81240	85840	You might just as well run up to the prophet, pull his beard and tweak him on the nose.
86000	89880	Now to infidels, the idea that this is blasphemy may sound wacky.
89880	95680	But what's even more wacky is that no one's really sure why the TV clip was blasphemous.
95680	101120	Some thought the song itself was blasphemous, but as we've seen, Ari TV went with the shoes.
101120	106440	Convinced it was good for ratings, they piled on the charge that GeoTV are a bunch of blasphemers.
106440	107440	Blasphemy!
107440	111520	He said it again!
111520	116040	But here's what really makes this a deserving item for wacky religious news.
116040	121600	By showing the offending clip in order to highlight the blasphemy, Ari TV itself was
121600	123600	accused of blasphemy.
123600	128200	Get the feeling life is imitating art, or in this case, religion is imitating comedy.
128200	134200	Right, we'll get the stage over.
134200	135200	That's right.
135200	140240	What makes a hilariously funny comedy sketch one year gets passed into actual religious
140240	141560	law the next.
141560	145240	Yes, it would be funny if it wasn't so deadly serious.
145240	149740	Every week there are news reports of people being arrested, shot, lynched or hacked to
149740	154160	death in Pakistan because of some alleged blasphemy.
154160	160560	According to Reuters, even showing evidence of blasphemy in a Pakistani court can be blasphemous.
160560	164480	So this gives us here at Wacky Religious News an idea.
164480	169260	Instead of trying to abolish blasphemy laws, we say, make them stronger.
169260	174620	If someone accuses his neighbour of blasphemy, he has to explain what the blasphemy was,
174620	180100	just as Ari TV did, and by repeating it he can be charged with blasphemy himself.
180100	184780	The police officer who takes the accused to a public prosecutor has to explain the charges
184780	189100	in detail, and that gets the police officer arrested for blasphemy.
189100	194480	I wonder how long it would be before everyone's so afraid of committing blasphemy that blasphemy
194480	197020	charges are no longer laid against anyone.
197020	198780	What if they do say Jehovah?
206780	208780	Now on to news of the apocalypse.
208780	215260	Hi guys, a couple of days ago a sinkhole appeared close to an area where we live.
215260	218180	And this isn't the first time we've heard about sinkholes.
218180	221380	We've been hearing about them all across the world for the last few years.
221380	225260	Oh, so these things have only been happening in the last few years.
225260	229880	This video by the two preachers goes on to document several sinkholes claiming they're
229880	231960	a sign of the end times.
231960	236020	What else could be causing these miraculous signs of Jesus' second coming?
236020	238700	So you've seen the videos.
238700	241380	They're pretty crazy really.
241380	247160	Over the last few years there's been a real acceleration of these sinkholes.
247160	251620	I've never even heard of them when I grew up as a boy, but now they're just everywhere.
251660	256740	Look, gay preachers, just because you only woke up to something happening last week when
256740	262620	you watched a compilation YouTube video doesn't mean this phenomenon is new or that it's accelerating
262620	264400	in frequency.
264400	268580	We can see sinkholes that are thousands of years old, and we can read about sinkholes
268580	270780	that happened a hundred years ago.
270780	274260	Scientific studies were done to explain why they happen.
274260	279020	If you really think they're miraculous, why is it God chooses to make them only at old
279020	285060	mining sites or in areas of limestone, where erosion causes underground caverns to be formed?
285060	286060	Coincidence?
286060	291700	And if you've noticed from those videos, you'll see that a lot of these sinkholes are happening
291700	292700	in urban areas.
292700	297140	They're not happening in the countryside so much, but mainly in urban areas.
297140	302100	And by pure coincidence, a lot of urban areas were built close to mining sites because miners
302100	304000	needed somewhere to live.
304000	308860	And as urban areas expand, a lot of them are spreading over abandoned mines.
308860	313600	If we're seeing more videos of them on the news or on YouTube, it could be because more
313600	317700	of them are happening, or it could be because there are more people with mobile phones to
317700	319380	film them.
319380	324340	What I mean is, could there be other perfectly natural explanations for the fact that more
324340	329140	sinkhole videos are appearing on YouTube, other than the possibility that this is a
329140	330860	sign of the coming of Jesus?
330860	337100	You know, who's really heard of these things happening, you know, a hundred years ago?
337340	340900	I've never heard really so much of this stuff happening, but it seems to be happening.
340900	345380	Hello gay preachers, I said could there be other perfectly natural explanations?
345380	348300	Heavy rain, erosion, et cetera, it seems to be happening across the world.
348300	349300	Breaking news!
349300	353040	Wacky religious news has just learned that a heap of land has slid down a hillside in
353040	354220	Italy.
354220	359540	We can confidently say this has never happened before, ever, in the entire history of mankind.
359540	362500	Hold on, we've just heard about another one.
362500	366060	Oh, and apparently there was another one last week in Mexico.
366060	369600	How come we've never heard about sliding land before?
369600	374960	These land slides, as we'll call them, obviously started happening last week when we became
374960	376140	aware of them.
376140	379240	So the gay preachers are right, Jesus is coming.
379240	381240	This has been wacky religious news.
