1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,000
Hehehehe, Wacky Willigis News.

2
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:39,560
Yes, on Wacky Willigis News we're not afraid to pick up news that's nine months old and

3
00:00:39,560 --> 00:00:42,640
pretend it's a 2014 retrospective.

4
00:00:42,640 --> 00:00:46,880
So did you spot the blasphemy in this Pakistan TV wedding?

5
00:00:46,880 --> 00:00:52,120
Was it the sexual tension graphically expressed during a religious ceremony, the insulting

6
00:00:52,120 --> 00:00:56,680
poking of the eye as if snubbing Allah, or the holding up of shoes viewed through the

7
00:00:56,680 --> 00:01:00,640
Islamic world as a covering for the lowest form of the human anatomy?

8
00:01:00,640 --> 00:01:07,120
Well this TV wedding was shown on Pakistan's GeoTV, so let's go to rival Ari TV for the

9
00:01:07,120 --> 00:01:08,120
answer.

10
00:01:08,120 --> 00:01:10,720
Yes, that's right.

11
00:01:10,720 --> 00:01:15,760
Holding up a pair of shoes is not normally blasphemy, but it is blasphemy when the shoes

12
00:01:15,760 --> 00:01:19,920
are held up during the playing of a traditional wedding song about the wedding of Muhammad's

13
00:01:19,920 --> 00:01:21,240
daughter.

14
00:01:21,240 --> 00:01:25,840
You might just as well run up to the prophet, pull his beard and tweak him on the nose.

15
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:29,880
Now to infidels, the idea that this is blasphemy may sound wacky.

16
00:01:29,880 --> 00:01:35,680
But what's even more wacky is that no one's really sure why the TV clip was blasphemous.

17
00:01:35,680 --> 00:01:41,120
Some thought the song itself was blasphemous, but as we've seen, Ari TV went with the shoes.

18
00:01:41,120 --> 00:01:46,440
Convinced it was good for ratings, they piled on the charge that GeoTV are a bunch of blasphemers.

19
00:01:46,440 --> 00:01:47,440
Blasphemy!

20
00:01:47,440 --> 00:01:51,520
He said it again!

21
00:01:51,520 --> 00:01:56,040
But here's what really makes this a deserving item for wacky religious news.

22
00:01:56,040 --> 00:02:01,600
By showing the offending clip in order to highlight the blasphemy, Ari TV itself was

23
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:03,600
accused of blasphemy.

24
00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:08,200
Get the feeling life is imitating art, or in this case, religion is imitating comedy.

25
00:02:08,200 --> 00:02:14,200
Right, we'll get the stage over.

26
00:02:14,200 --> 00:02:15,200
That's right.

27
00:02:15,200 --> 00:02:20,240
What makes a hilariously funny comedy sketch one year gets passed into actual religious

28
00:02:20,240 --> 00:02:21,560
law the next.

29
00:02:21,560 --> 00:02:25,240
Yes, it would be funny if it wasn't so deadly serious.

30
00:02:25,240 --> 00:02:29,740
Every week there are news reports of people being arrested, shot, lynched or hacked to

31
00:02:29,740 --> 00:02:34,160
death in Pakistan because of some alleged blasphemy.

32
00:02:34,160 --> 00:02:40,560
According to Reuters, even showing evidence of blasphemy in a Pakistani court can be blasphemous.

33
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:44,480
So this gives us here at Wacky Religious News an idea.

34
00:02:44,480 --> 00:02:49,260
Instead of trying to abolish blasphemy laws, we say, make them stronger.

35
00:02:49,260 --> 00:02:54,620
If someone accuses his neighbour of blasphemy, he has to explain what the blasphemy was,

36
00:02:54,620 --> 00:03:00,100
just as Ari TV did, and by repeating it he can be charged with blasphemy himself.

37
00:03:00,100 --> 00:03:04,780
The police officer who takes the accused to a public prosecutor has to explain the charges

38
00:03:04,780 --> 00:03:09,100
in detail, and that gets the police officer arrested for blasphemy.

39
00:03:09,100 --> 00:03:14,480
I wonder how long it would be before everyone's so afraid of committing blasphemy that blasphemy

40
00:03:14,480 --> 00:03:17,020
charges are no longer laid against anyone.

41
00:03:17,020 --> 00:03:18,780
What if they do say Jehovah?

42
00:03:26,780 --> 00:03:28,780
Now on to news of the apocalypse.

43
00:03:28,780 --> 00:03:35,260
Hi guys, a couple of days ago a sinkhole appeared close to an area where we live.

44
00:03:35,260 --> 00:03:38,180
And this isn't the first time we've heard about sinkholes.

45
00:03:38,180 --> 00:03:41,380
We've been hearing about them all across the world for the last few years.

46
00:03:41,380 --> 00:03:45,260
Oh, so these things have only been happening in the last few years.

47
00:03:45,260 --> 00:03:49,880
This video by the two preachers goes on to document several sinkholes claiming they're

48
00:03:49,880 --> 00:03:51,960
a sign of the end times.

49
00:03:51,960 --> 00:03:56,020
What else could be causing these miraculous signs of Jesus' second coming?

50
00:03:56,020 --> 00:03:58,700
So you've seen the videos.

51
00:03:58,700 --> 00:04:01,380
They're pretty crazy really.

52
00:04:01,380 --> 00:04:07,160
Over the last few years there's been a real acceleration of these sinkholes.

53
00:04:07,160 --> 00:04:11,620
I've never even heard of them when I grew up as a boy, but now they're just everywhere.

54
00:04:11,660 --> 00:04:16,740
Look, gay preachers, just because you only woke up to something happening last week when

55
00:04:16,740 --> 00:04:22,620
you watched a compilation YouTube video doesn't mean this phenomenon is new or that it's accelerating

56
00:04:22,620 --> 00:04:24,400
in frequency.

57
00:04:24,400 --> 00:04:28,580
We can see sinkholes that are thousands of years old, and we can read about sinkholes

58
00:04:28,580 --> 00:04:30,780
that happened a hundred years ago.

59
00:04:30,780 --> 00:04:34,260
Scientific studies were done to explain why they happen.

60
00:04:34,260 --> 00:04:39,020
If you really think they're miraculous, why is it God chooses to make them only at old

61
00:04:39,020 --> 00:04:45,060
mining sites or in areas of limestone, where erosion causes underground caverns to be formed?

62
00:04:45,060 --> 00:04:46,060
Coincidence?

63
00:04:46,060 --> 00:04:51,700
And if you've noticed from those videos, you'll see that a lot of these sinkholes are happening

64
00:04:51,700 --> 00:04:52,700
in urban areas.

65
00:04:52,700 --> 00:04:57,140
They're not happening in the countryside so much, but mainly in urban areas.

66
00:04:57,140 --> 00:05:02,100
And by pure coincidence, a lot of urban areas were built close to mining sites because miners

67
00:05:02,100 --> 00:05:04,000
needed somewhere to live.

68
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:08,860
And as urban areas expand, a lot of them are spreading over abandoned mines.

69
00:05:08,860 --> 00:05:13,600
If we're seeing more videos of them on the news or on YouTube, it could be because more

70
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:17,700
of them are happening, or it could be because there are more people with mobile phones to

71
00:05:17,700 --> 00:05:19,380
film them.

72
00:05:19,380 --> 00:05:24,340
What I mean is, could there be other perfectly natural explanations for the fact that more

73
00:05:24,340 --> 00:05:29,140
sinkhole videos are appearing on YouTube, other than the possibility that this is a

74
00:05:29,140 --> 00:05:30,860
sign of the coming of Jesus?

75
00:05:30,860 --> 00:05:37,100
You know, who's really heard of these things happening, you know, a hundred years ago?

76
00:05:37,340 --> 00:05:40,900
I've never heard really so much of this stuff happening, but it seems to be happening.

77
00:05:40,900 --> 00:05:45,380
Hello gay preachers, I said could there be other perfectly natural explanations?

78
00:05:45,380 --> 00:05:48,300
Heavy rain, erosion, et cetera, it seems to be happening across the world.

79
00:05:48,300 --> 00:05:49,300
Breaking news!

80
00:05:49,300 --> 00:05:53,040
Wacky religious news has just learned that a heap of land has slid down a hillside in

81
00:05:53,040 --> 00:05:54,220
Italy.

82
00:05:54,220 --> 00:05:59,540
We can confidently say this has never happened before, ever, in the entire history of mankind.

83
00:05:59,540 --> 00:06:02,500
Hold on, we've just heard about another one.

84
00:06:02,500 --> 00:06:06,060
Oh, and apparently there was another one last week in Mexico.

85
00:06:06,060 --> 00:06:09,600
How come we've never heard about sliding land before?

86
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:14,960
These land slides, as we'll call them, obviously started happening last week when we became

87
00:06:14,960 --> 00:06:16,140
aware of them.

88
00:06:16,140 --> 00:06:19,240
So the gay preachers are right, Jesus is coming.

89
00:06:19,240 --> 00:06:21,240
This has been wacky religious news.
