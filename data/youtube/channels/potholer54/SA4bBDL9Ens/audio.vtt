00:00.000 --> 00:07.000
Hehehehe, Wacky Willigis News.

00:30.000 --> 00:39.560
Yes, on Wacky Willigis News we're not afraid to pick up news that's nine months old and

00:39.560 --> 00:42.640
pretend it's a 2014 retrospective.

00:42.640 --> 00:46.880
So did you spot the blasphemy in this Pakistan TV wedding?

00:46.880 --> 00:52.120
Was it the sexual tension graphically expressed during a religious ceremony, the insulting

00:52.120 --> 00:56.680
poking of the eye as if snubbing Allah, or the holding up of shoes viewed through the

00:56.680 --> 01:00.640
Islamic world as a covering for the lowest form of the human anatomy?

01:00.640 --> 01:07.120
Well this TV wedding was shown on Pakistan's GeoTV, so let's go to rival Ari TV for the

01:07.120 --> 01:08.120
answer.

01:08.120 --> 01:10.720
Yes, that's right.

01:10.720 --> 01:15.760
Holding up a pair of shoes is not normally blasphemy, but it is blasphemy when the shoes

01:15.760 --> 01:19.920
are held up during the playing of a traditional wedding song about the wedding of Muhammad's

01:19.920 --> 01:21.240
daughter.

01:21.240 --> 01:25.840
You might just as well run up to the prophet, pull his beard and tweak him on the nose.

01:26.000 --> 01:29.880
Now to infidels, the idea that this is blasphemy may sound wacky.

01:29.880 --> 01:35.680
But what's even more wacky is that no one's really sure why the TV clip was blasphemous.

01:35.680 --> 01:41.120
Some thought the song itself was blasphemous, but as we've seen, Ari TV went with the shoes.

01:41.120 --> 01:46.440
Convinced it was good for ratings, they piled on the charge that GeoTV are a bunch of blasphemers.

01:46.440 --> 01:47.440
Blasphemy!

01:47.440 --> 01:51.520
He said it again!

01:51.520 --> 01:56.040
But here's what really makes this a deserving item for wacky religious news.

01:56.040 --> 02:01.600
By showing the offending clip in order to highlight the blasphemy, Ari TV itself was

02:01.600 --> 02:03.600
accused of blasphemy.

02:03.600 --> 02:08.200
Get the feeling life is imitating art, or in this case, religion is imitating comedy.

02:08.200 --> 02:14.200
Right, we'll get the stage over.

02:14.200 --> 02:15.200
That's right.

02:15.200 --> 02:20.240
What makes a hilariously funny comedy sketch one year gets passed into actual religious

02:20.240 --> 02:21.560
law the next.

02:21.560 --> 02:25.240
Yes, it would be funny if it wasn't so deadly serious.

02:25.240 --> 02:29.740
Every week there are news reports of people being arrested, shot, lynched or hacked to

02:29.740 --> 02:34.160
death in Pakistan because of some alleged blasphemy.

02:34.160 --> 02:40.560
According to Reuters, even showing evidence of blasphemy in a Pakistani court can be blasphemous.

02:40.560 --> 02:44.480
So this gives us here at Wacky Religious News an idea.

02:44.480 --> 02:49.260
Instead of trying to abolish blasphemy laws, we say, make them stronger.

02:49.260 --> 02:54.620
If someone accuses his neighbour of blasphemy, he has to explain what the blasphemy was,

02:54.620 --> 03:00.100
just as Ari TV did, and by repeating it he can be charged with blasphemy himself.

03:00.100 --> 03:04.780
The police officer who takes the accused to a public prosecutor has to explain the charges

03:04.780 --> 03:09.100
in detail, and that gets the police officer arrested for blasphemy.

03:09.100 --> 03:14.480
I wonder how long it would be before everyone's so afraid of committing blasphemy that blasphemy

03:14.480 --> 03:17.020
charges are no longer laid against anyone.

03:17.020 --> 03:18.780
What if they do say Jehovah?

03:26.780 --> 03:28.780
Now on to news of the apocalypse.

03:28.780 --> 03:35.260
Hi guys, a couple of days ago a sinkhole appeared close to an area where we live.

03:35.260 --> 03:38.180
And this isn't the first time we've heard about sinkholes.

03:38.180 --> 03:41.380
We've been hearing about them all across the world for the last few years.

03:41.380 --> 03:45.260
Oh, so these things have only been happening in the last few years.

03:45.260 --> 03:49.880
This video by the two preachers goes on to document several sinkholes claiming they're

03:49.880 --> 03:51.960
a sign of the end times.

03:51.960 --> 03:56.020
What else could be causing these miraculous signs of Jesus' second coming?

03:56.020 --> 03:58.700
So you've seen the videos.

03:58.700 --> 04:01.380
They're pretty crazy really.

04:01.380 --> 04:07.160
Over the last few years there's been a real acceleration of these sinkholes.

04:07.160 --> 04:11.620
I've never even heard of them when I grew up as a boy, but now they're just everywhere.

04:11.660 --> 04:16.740
Look, gay preachers, just because you only woke up to something happening last week when

04:16.740 --> 04:22.620
you watched a compilation YouTube video doesn't mean this phenomenon is new or that it's accelerating

04:22.620 --> 04:24.400
in frequency.

04:24.400 --> 04:28.580
We can see sinkholes that are thousands of years old, and we can read about sinkholes

04:28.580 --> 04:30.780
that happened a hundred years ago.

04:30.780 --> 04:34.260
Scientific studies were done to explain why they happen.

04:34.260 --> 04:39.020
If you really think they're miraculous, why is it God chooses to make them only at old

04:39.020 --> 04:45.060
mining sites or in areas of limestone, where erosion causes underground caverns to be formed?

04:45.060 --> 04:46.060
Coincidence?

04:46.060 --> 04:51.700
And if you've noticed from those videos, you'll see that a lot of these sinkholes are happening

04:51.700 --> 04:52.700
in urban areas.

04:52.700 --> 04:57.140
They're not happening in the countryside so much, but mainly in urban areas.

04:57.140 --> 05:02.100
And by pure coincidence, a lot of urban areas were built close to mining sites because miners

05:02.100 --> 05:04.000
needed somewhere to live.

05:04.000 --> 05:08.860
And as urban areas expand, a lot of them are spreading over abandoned mines.

05:08.860 --> 05:13.600
If we're seeing more videos of them on the news or on YouTube, it could be because more

05:13.600 --> 05:17.700
of them are happening, or it could be because there are more people with mobile phones to

05:17.700 --> 05:19.380
film them.

05:19.380 --> 05:24.340
What I mean is, could there be other perfectly natural explanations for the fact that more

05:24.340 --> 05:29.140
sinkhole videos are appearing on YouTube, other than the possibility that this is a

05:29.140 --> 05:30.860
sign of the coming of Jesus?

05:30.860 --> 05:37.100
You know, who's really heard of these things happening, you know, a hundred years ago?

05:37.340 --> 05:40.900
I've never heard really so much of this stuff happening, but it seems to be happening.

05:40.900 --> 05:45.380
Hello gay preachers, I said could there be other perfectly natural explanations?

05:45.380 --> 05:48.300
Heavy rain, erosion, et cetera, it seems to be happening across the world.

05:48.300 --> 05:49.300
Breaking news!

05:49.300 --> 05:53.040
Wacky religious news has just learned that a heap of land has slid down a hillside in

05:53.040 --> 05:54.220
Italy.

05:54.220 --> 05:59.540
We can confidently say this has never happened before, ever, in the entire history of mankind.

05:59.540 --> 06:02.500
Hold on, we've just heard about another one.

06:02.500 --> 06:06.060
Oh, and apparently there was another one last week in Mexico.

06:06.060 --> 06:09.600
How come we've never heard about sliding land before?

06:09.600 --> 06:14.960
These land slides, as we'll call them, obviously started happening last week when we became

06:14.960 --> 06:16.140
aware of them.

06:16.140 --> 06:19.240
So the gay preachers are right, Jesus is coming.

06:19.240 --> 06:21.240
This has been wacky religious news.
