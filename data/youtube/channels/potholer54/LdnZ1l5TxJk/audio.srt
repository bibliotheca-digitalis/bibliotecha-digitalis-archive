1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,360
When I was about 10 years old, a story was going around school that Coca-Cola was so bad for your teeth

2
00:00:05,360 --> 00:00:09,360
that if you put a tooth in a glass of coke, it would dissolve overnight.

3
00:00:09,360 --> 00:00:13,120
So when a tooth of mine fell out, I thought it would be fun to watch this happen.

4
00:00:13,120 --> 00:00:19,440
I left the glass overnight, then all day, and then a week, and the tooth still wouldn't dissolve.

5
00:00:19,440 --> 00:00:21,520
Now this should have told me something.

6
00:00:21,520 --> 00:00:25,920
If I'd asked the kids at school how they knew that a tooth dissolved in Coca-Cola,

7
00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:29,120
they probably would have said they'd heard it from other kids,

8
00:00:29,120 --> 00:00:31,840
and the other kids would have got it from other kids.

9
00:00:31,840 --> 00:00:34,560
And I would have thought, well, how the hell does anybody know?

10
00:00:35,920 --> 00:00:39,520
It was only years later that I learned the key to examining and debunking

11
00:00:39,520 --> 00:00:42,240
the floating pieces of fatuous information.

12
00:00:42,240 --> 00:00:44,880
Just ask the question, how do you know?

13
00:00:44,880 --> 00:00:47,680
Or to put it more specifically, what's your source?

14
00:00:48,320 --> 00:00:52,400
I thought I'd kick off this series about science and the media by looking at sources,

15
00:00:52,400 --> 00:00:54,640
because a lot of people have asked me about it.

16
00:00:54,640 --> 00:00:57,680
How do we know whether to trust the information we get?

17
00:00:57,680 --> 00:00:59,280
And where can we go to check it?

18
00:00:59,840 --> 00:01:06,000
Interestingly enough, it harks back to the early Persian Empire, about 500 BC.

19
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:11,440
If you've ever fallen for this kind of barroom wisdom, don't worry, so do a lot of journalists.

20
00:01:11,440 --> 00:01:15,600
Recently, someone sent me a message about an odd assertion in the Daily Mail

21
00:01:15,600 --> 00:01:19,200
that a nuclear explosion on Mars 180 million years ago

22
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:23,040
turned the planet into a dusty, rubble-strewn radioactive desert,

23
00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:26,080
and that Mars is red because of this radioactive material.

24
00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:29,920
He was rightly sceptical and asked if there was anything in it.

25
00:01:30,720 --> 00:01:33,360
The story, of course, has now gone viral on the internet.

26
00:01:34,160 --> 00:01:36,560
Now, it's no good going through volumes of journals

27
00:01:36,560 --> 00:01:40,160
trying to find out about the geology of Mars to prove this wrong.

28
00:01:40,160 --> 00:01:42,720
Just find out where the information comes from

29
00:01:42,720 --> 00:01:45,600
and start by looking through the Daily Mail story for a source.

30
00:01:46,240 --> 00:01:47,440
And here it is.

31
00:01:47,440 --> 00:01:52,400
The information came from an interview with someone called John Brandenburg on Fox News.

32
00:01:52,400 --> 00:01:56,240
So we googled John Brandenburg Fox News, and here's the story.

33
00:01:56,880 --> 00:01:59,280
Now, how does Brandenburg know all this?

34
00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:01,280
Well, there the trail goes cold.

35
00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:05,440
There's no study and no research paper quoted, just one man's opinion.

36
00:02:06,160 --> 00:02:09,600
For most journalists outside the field of science, that's all they need.

37
00:02:10,320 --> 00:02:14,160
But science isn't like history or economics or medieval art.

38
00:02:14,160 --> 00:02:18,080
The facts in science are easy to source because they all come from research

39
00:02:18,080 --> 00:02:20,960
that's been laid out in peer-reviewed scientific papers.

40
00:02:21,600 --> 00:02:23,920
So let's see if Brandenburg has written one.

41
00:02:24,560 --> 00:02:28,400
The best database of published papers is the ISI Web of Knowledge,

42
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:30,320
now run by Thomson Reuters.

43
00:02:30,320 --> 00:02:33,520
Google Scholar is also an excellent resource.

44
00:02:33,520 --> 00:02:37,200
And yes, a search comes up with a paper by Brandenburg called

45
00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:40,960
Evidence for a Large Natural Paleonuclear Reactor on Mars.

46
00:02:41,520 --> 00:02:45,120
But this isn't a peer-reviewed paper in a scientific journal.

47
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:48,000
This was just one of over 1800 papers

48
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:51,520
submitted to the 42nd Lunar and Planetary Science Conference

49
00:02:51,520 --> 00:02:53,520
as matters of interest and discussion.

50
00:02:54,160 --> 00:02:57,120
The only other thing we have is a book by Brandenburg

51
00:02:57,120 --> 00:02:59,280
called Life and Death on Mars.

52
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:02,800
And it makes some fairly extraordinary claims for what it calls

53
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:06,480
the terrible truth that Mars was once just like the Earth

54
00:03:06,480 --> 00:03:09,040
with oceans and life and a civilization

55
00:03:09,040 --> 00:03:12,160
that was wiped out by that radioactive explosion.

56
00:03:12,160 --> 00:03:19,680
The Sidonian hypothesis was formulated by us based on the photographs

57
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:24,000
from the Viking of what looks like the remains of the dead civilization,

58
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:25,360
archaeological remnants.

59
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:29,760
So despite the label science, the media have simply reprinted

60
00:03:29,760 --> 00:03:33,920
Brandenburg's speculation without the backing of any peer-reviewed paper.

61
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:39,120
But what about that headline claiming Mars is red because of radioactivity?

62
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:43,520
Surely everyone knows that Mars is reddish because of iron oxide in the soil.

63
00:03:44,080 --> 00:03:45,680
Well, not everyone apparently.

64
00:03:46,320 --> 00:03:50,480
The mail got its headline from a single line in the Fox News story.

65
00:03:50,480 --> 00:03:55,520
But the line isn't in quotation marks and isn't even attributed to John Brandenburg.

66
00:03:55,520 --> 00:03:58,320
In a recent radio interview, Brandenburg seems to accept

67
00:03:58,320 --> 00:04:02,560
that Mars is red because of oxidation, not radioactivity.

68
00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:06,080
You'll notice that Mars' surface is heavily oxidized.

69
00:04:06,080 --> 00:04:11,920
In fact, if you look at the Valles Marineris, the layers, they're bright red.

70
00:04:11,920 --> 00:04:15,520
I emailed Fox News to ask for a source in vain.

71
00:04:15,520 --> 00:04:19,520
But after a career watching badly written stories like this unfold,

72
00:04:19,520 --> 00:04:22,320
I've got a pretty good inkling as to what might have happened.

73
00:04:22,320 --> 00:04:25,360
Brandenburg probably told the reporter, John Brandon,

74
00:04:25,360 --> 00:04:28,080
that the nuclear explosion turned the planet red,

75
00:04:28,080 --> 00:04:31,200
meaning that it turned a lot of the iron-rich rock into dust

76
00:04:31,200 --> 00:04:32,800
and exposed it to oxidation.

77
00:04:33,440 --> 00:04:37,120
All Brandon heard was that the explosion caused Mars to turn red,

78
00:04:37,120 --> 00:04:42,400
and from his knowledge of the way radioactive material gives off a colorful glow in The Simpsons,

79
00:04:42,400 --> 00:04:46,000
he assumed this meant that the red color was due to radioactivity.

80
00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:51,760
That's what happens when you let a writer with no background in science loose on the science page.

81
00:04:52,880 --> 00:04:54,560
Then an editor at the Daily Mail,

82
00:04:54,560 --> 00:04:58,720
equally ignorant of the difference between radioactivity and oxidation,

83
00:04:58,720 --> 00:05:00,240
made the blunder a headline.

84
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:06,640
Between them, Fox News and the Daily Mail turned what was already unsubstantiated speculation

85
00:05:06,640 --> 00:05:09,840
into a wonderful pas de deux of complete stupidity.

86
00:05:10,960 --> 00:05:14,480
So the information trail is a bit like a Chinese whisper.

87
00:05:14,480 --> 00:05:18,560
As a piece of information gets passed along, it can get distorted.

88
00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:23,840
It could be because of a misunderstanding, or it could be intentional misrepresentation.

89
00:05:23,840 --> 00:05:26,800
The only way to be sure of how the information started out

90
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:31,280
is to go in the opposite direction and follow the trail back to its source.

91
00:05:31,280 --> 00:05:34,960
And in my experience, however many people tell you something,

92
00:05:34,960 --> 00:05:38,320
the trail nearly always does end in just one source.

93
00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:43,600
Now we can't do this with everything we hear, or we'd be hitting the books 24 hours a day,

94
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:46,560
but we should be able to spot something that's a bit fishy.

95
00:05:47,200 --> 00:05:52,960
Again, in science, unlike history or economics, spotting something fishy is very easy.

96
00:05:52,960 --> 00:05:56,640
If a newspaper not renowned for fact-checking or accuracy

97
00:05:56,640 --> 00:06:00,640
makes a claim that's completely at odds with current scientific evidence,

98
00:06:00,640 --> 00:06:05,840
then either scientists are stupid, or they're lying, or the newspaper's got something wrong.

99
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:11,280
As I've shown, the Internet is a great tool for tracking information back to its source

100
00:06:11,280 --> 00:06:13,360
and finding out how it's been altered.

101
00:06:13,360 --> 00:06:17,520
But it's also good at disseminating bad information to millions.

102
00:06:17,520 --> 00:06:19,440
It's rather like a screwdriver.

103
00:06:19,520 --> 00:06:23,360
You can use it to take apart a complex bit of machinery to see how it works,

104
00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:24,960
or why it's gone wrong,

105
00:06:24,960 --> 00:06:28,880
or you can stick it in your ear to see how far it goes before it meets resistance.

106
00:06:29,520 --> 00:06:33,440
Unfortunately, a lot of people would rather stick the screwdriver in their ear

107
00:06:33,440 --> 00:06:36,080
than undertake the simple act of undoing a screw.

108
00:06:37,040 --> 00:06:41,760
In my climate change series, I had the example of a claim that went viral over the Internet

109
00:06:41,760 --> 00:06:44,960
that NASA said the sun was responsible for global warming.

110
00:06:45,680 --> 00:06:49,040
Millions of people believed it without doing the simplest thing,

111
00:06:49,040 --> 00:06:53,760
clicking the links back to the actual NASA story to read it for themselves.

112
00:06:53,760 --> 00:06:56,880
Once you follow the Chinese whispers back to their source,

113
00:06:56,880 --> 00:07:00,000
you can see where along the chain the story was changed.

114
00:07:01,280 --> 00:07:05,280
Sometimes the sources are incomplete, and that does make them harder to trace.

115
00:07:05,840 --> 00:07:09,040
One way to do this is to take a chunk of text that they've written,

116
00:07:09,040 --> 00:07:11,840
because they nearly always copy and paste these things,

117
00:07:11,840 --> 00:07:14,400
and put it in Google to see where it leads.

118
00:07:14,400 --> 00:07:16,480
You'll find the myth repeated many times,

119
00:07:16,480 --> 00:07:19,760
but someone somewhere will give a source as to where it came from.

120
00:07:20,560 --> 00:07:24,400
But I would always be suspicious of anyone who's trying to hide his source.

121
00:07:24,400 --> 00:07:28,080
Why don't they want you to know where their information comes from?

122
00:07:28,080 --> 00:07:30,720
A good example is Conservopedia's webpage,

123
00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:34,800
Counter Examples to an Old Earth, because it's a mixed bag.

124
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:38,560
The first counterexample has a link that doesn't even address the claim,

125
00:07:38,560 --> 00:07:40,000
let alone support it.

126
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:42,240
The second one offers no source at all.

127
00:07:42,960 --> 00:07:44,720
So this brings me to the next point.

128
00:07:44,720 --> 00:07:46,480
What do we do when someone says,

129
00:07:46,480 --> 00:07:50,320
a study shows, or according to a paper in the journal of whatever?

130
00:07:50,880 --> 00:07:53,120
Well, do exactly what I said at the beginning,

131
00:07:53,120 --> 00:07:56,320
ask for a source, not just vague reminiscences.

132
00:07:56,960 --> 00:07:58,640
Most of the time when I ask this question,

133
00:07:58,640 --> 00:08:01,200
people can't tell me what study they're talking about,

134
00:08:01,200 --> 00:08:03,600
or name the paper they're referring to.

135
00:08:03,600 --> 00:08:07,360
It's more likely than not they simply heard from someone that there is a study,

136
00:08:07,360 --> 00:08:09,280
and took this claim at face value.

137
00:08:09,920 --> 00:08:12,560
Even if they can cite the paper, check it,

138
00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:15,040
because chances are, as with Christopher Monckton

139
00:08:15,040 --> 00:08:17,360
and his dozens of scientific papers,

140
00:08:17,360 --> 00:08:19,600
it's possible they're misrepresenting it,

141
00:08:19,600 --> 00:08:20,880
or they haven't even read it.

142
00:08:21,600 --> 00:08:25,040
When Chipster07 posted a message on my video forum,

143
00:08:25,040 --> 00:08:28,560
saying there was no correlation between CO2 levels and temperatures

144
00:08:28,560 --> 00:08:30,560
over the last 600 million years,

145
00:08:30,560 --> 00:08:32,800
I of course asked him for his source.

146
00:08:32,800 --> 00:08:35,440
The answer came back very authoritatively,

147
00:08:35,440 --> 00:08:38,800
to researchers, Berner and Scotties, and a website.

148
00:08:39,520 --> 00:08:40,800
So I checked the website.

149
00:08:41,440 --> 00:08:44,480
It gives a link to the research by Berner and Scotties,

150
00:08:44,480 --> 00:08:45,520
so click again.

151
00:08:46,080 --> 00:08:50,320
Scotties has compiled a graph of temperatures over the last 600 million years,

152
00:08:50,320 --> 00:08:54,400
but gives no conclusion about how this relates to CO2 levels.

153
00:08:54,400 --> 00:08:56,320
So that source doesn't support the claim.

154
00:08:56,880 --> 00:09:01,520
Berner has compiled a graph of CO2 levels over the last 550 million years,

155
00:09:01,520 --> 00:09:05,840
and according to him there is a correlation between CO2 levels and temperatures.

156
00:09:06,720 --> 00:09:10,160
So how can a website make a claim that completely contradicts

157
00:09:10,160 --> 00:09:12,720
a paper that's cited in support of it?

158
00:09:12,720 --> 00:09:13,680
Answer?

159
00:09:13,680 --> 00:09:15,920
When the website is run by this guy.

160
00:09:15,920 --> 00:09:17,520
It's been proven time and time again

161
00:09:17,520 --> 00:09:20,320
that reincarnation breaks no physical laws as we know them.

162
00:09:20,320 --> 00:09:23,600
When Cliff Clavin expounded his knowledge in the barroom at Cheers,

163
00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:26,480
he had an audience of less than a dozen people.

164
00:09:26,480 --> 00:09:29,840
These days, Cliffie would undoubtedly have his own website,

165
00:09:29,840 --> 00:09:32,640
and to disguise the fact that it's written by a mailman,

166
00:09:32,640 --> 00:09:34,240
he can make it anonymous,

167
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:37,040
or he can give himself any title he likes,

168
00:09:37,040 --> 00:09:39,440
and claim a specialist background he doesn't have.

169
00:09:40,320 --> 00:09:44,160
So when Chipster07 quotes Berner and Scottease as his source,

170
00:09:44,160 --> 00:09:47,280
he's taking the word of the equivalent of a guy he met in a bar.

171
00:09:47,840 --> 00:09:51,520
Okay, there's a fancy website and it all sounds very plausible,

172
00:09:51,520 --> 00:09:55,440
but remember Cliff Clavin is only as good as his sources.

173
00:09:55,440 --> 00:09:58,720
Chipster07 never actually read Berner's paper,

174
00:09:58,720 --> 00:10:01,120
and neither did the guy who runs the website,

175
00:10:01,120 --> 00:10:05,520
or they both would have noticed that it says the complete opposite of what's being claimed.

176
00:10:06,320 --> 00:10:08,000
In the days before the internet,

177
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:11,120
journalists did a lot of their initial research in cuts,

178
00:10:11,120 --> 00:10:13,600
old newspaper clippings kept on file.

179
00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:15,840
I once spent hours trying to track down a myth

180
00:10:15,840 --> 00:10:20,240
that Tokyo gets hit by a major earthquake once every 70 years,

181
00:10:20,240 --> 00:10:24,560
and I finally tracked it down to a single wire agency story in 1970

182
00:10:24,560 --> 00:10:28,480
that cited a research study, and was then badly misquoted.

183
00:10:29,280 --> 00:10:31,200
The myth is still around to this day.

184
00:10:31,920 --> 00:10:34,960
The story survived because it was widely disseminated,

185
00:10:34,960 --> 00:10:37,760
and we do tend to believe what everyone else believes,

186
00:10:37,760 --> 00:10:39,360
journalists included.

187
00:10:39,360 --> 00:10:43,680
But it used to take years for stories like these to pass into general mythology,

188
00:10:43,680 --> 00:10:47,920
because at least most newspapers had editors who required facts to be checked,

189
00:10:47,920 --> 00:10:50,400
and rumors were generally spread by word of mouth.

190
00:10:50,960 --> 00:10:55,600
Today it takes just a few hours, and any debunking is always belated.

191
00:10:55,600 --> 00:10:59,040
The days when journalists had to get on a telephone and speak to someone,

192
00:10:59,040 --> 00:11:02,000
or put on their coats and do face-to-face interviews,

193
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:04,400
and witness events with their own eyes,

194
00:11:04,400 --> 00:11:07,120
sadly that's taken a backseat to the click of the mouse.

195
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:10,640
An editor I've known for years was moaning recently that

196
00:11:10,640 --> 00:11:13,760
our new journalists spend all their time on the internet.

197
00:11:13,760 --> 00:11:18,480
Our willingness to drive screwdrivers into our brains rather than unlock the truth

198
00:11:18,480 --> 00:11:21,840
has led to a culture of gullibility that's astonishing

199
00:11:21,840 --> 00:11:23,760
in even the most intelligent writers.

200
00:11:24,400 --> 00:11:27,440
I was misled by the internet, whines Christopher Booker,

201
00:11:27,440 --> 00:11:31,760
after admitting a quote he printed about climate change was a complete fabrication.

202
00:11:32,320 --> 00:11:33,600
Poor baby.

203
00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:36,000
Blaming the internet for your gullibility

204
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:39,280
is like blaming the screwdriver for your neurological impairment.

205
00:11:40,080 --> 00:11:44,000
Science is often seen as a difficult subject, and yes it is,

206
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:48,480
because it's detailed, meticulous, and demands the highest possible accuracy.

207
00:11:48,480 --> 00:11:52,000
But those qualities also make it very easy to check.

208
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:56,560
There's a mechanism for documenting facts that has survived for 200 years,

209
00:11:56,560 --> 00:11:59,840
and has given us all the technological achievements we enjoy today.

210
00:12:00,480 --> 00:12:02,560
But we have to be willing to consult it.

211
00:12:03,280 --> 00:12:04,880
Not everyone can, of course.

212
00:12:04,880 --> 00:12:07,840
Some papers aren't accessible without a subscription.

213
00:12:07,840 --> 00:12:10,000
Most are difficult to understand.

214
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:14,160
So my advice is to go to the most reliable media on science subjects,

215
00:12:14,160 --> 00:12:18,640
which are the science magazines like Wired, Scientific American, and New Scientist.

216
00:12:19,280 --> 00:12:22,960
I obviously have to declare an interest because I used to work for the last one.

217
00:12:22,960 --> 00:12:27,520
But from that experience, I know that if I was doing a story on microbiology,

218
00:12:27,520 --> 00:12:31,200
it would be edited by someone with a degree in microbiology.

219
00:12:31,200 --> 00:12:36,720
A story on nuclear physics would be edited by the news editor who has a PhD in physics.

220
00:12:36,720 --> 00:12:40,640
And a lot of New Scientist readers are people who are specialists in their field,

221
00:12:40,640 --> 00:12:44,480
so the editorial staff know that any mistakes would be spotted,

222
00:12:44,480 --> 00:12:46,960
and New Scientist reputation would be at stake.

223
00:12:47,680 --> 00:12:52,560
Quality newspapers with science correspondents who actually have degrees in science

224
00:12:52,560 --> 00:12:56,320
are also a fairly reliable source of what's coming out of the scientific journals.

225
00:12:57,280 --> 00:13:01,600
Ultimately, the accuracy of what we believe is our responsibility,

226
00:13:01,600 --> 00:13:04,560
because where we source our information is entirely up to us.

227
00:13:05,200 --> 00:13:09,760
We can check the accuracy of stories ourselves and use reliable sources,

228
00:13:09,760 --> 00:13:12,480
or we can believe the Cliff Clavins of this world.

229
00:13:14,480 --> 00:13:19,280
Recent medical studies have shown that time zone transference, aka jet lag,

230
00:13:19,280 --> 00:13:21,840
not only can be very upsetting to one's metabolism,

231
00:13:21,840 --> 00:13:26,160
but also directly correlates to the loss of hair follicles.

232
00:13:28,560 --> 00:13:29,840
Are you a doctor?

233
00:13:29,840 --> 00:13:33,200
No, he's a flume.
