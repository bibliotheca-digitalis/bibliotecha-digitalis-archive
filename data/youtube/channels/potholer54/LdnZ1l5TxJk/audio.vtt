00:00.000 --> 00:05.360
When I was about 10 years old, a story was going around school that Coca-Cola was so bad for your teeth

00:05.360 --> 00:09.360
that if you put a tooth in a glass of coke, it would dissolve overnight.

00:09.360 --> 00:13.120
So when a tooth of mine fell out, I thought it would be fun to watch this happen.

00:13.120 --> 00:19.440
I left the glass overnight, then all day, and then a week, and the tooth still wouldn't dissolve.

00:19.440 --> 00:21.520
Now this should have told me something.

00:21.520 --> 00:25.920
If I'd asked the kids at school how they knew that a tooth dissolved in Coca-Cola,

00:25.920 --> 00:29.120
they probably would have said they'd heard it from other kids,

00:29.120 --> 00:31.840
and the other kids would have got it from other kids.

00:31.840 --> 00:34.560
And I would have thought, well, how the hell does anybody know?

00:35.920 --> 00:39.520
It was only years later that I learned the key to examining and debunking

00:39.520 --> 00:42.240
the floating pieces of fatuous information.

00:42.240 --> 00:44.880
Just ask the question, how do you know?

00:44.880 --> 00:47.680
Or to put it more specifically, what's your source?

00:48.320 --> 00:52.400
I thought I'd kick off this series about science and the media by looking at sources,

00:52.400 --> 00:54.640
because a lot of people have asked me about it.

00:54.640 --> 00:57.680
How do we know whether to trust the information we get?

00:57.680 --> 00:59.280
And where can we go to check it?

00:59.840 --> 01:06.000
Interestingly enough, it harks back to the early Persian Empire, about 500 BC.

01:06.000 --> 01:11.440
If you've ever fallen for this kind of barroom wisdom, don't worry, so do a lot of journalists.

01:11.440 --> 01:15.600
Recently, someone sent me a message about an odd assertion in the Daily Mail

01:15.600 --> 01:19.200
that a nuclear explosion on Mars 180 million years ago

01:19.200 --> 01:23.040
turned the planet into a dusty, rubble-strewn radioactive desert,

01:23.040 --> 01:26.080
and that Mars is red because of this radioactive material.

01:26.640 --> 01:29.920
He was rightly sceptical and asked if there was anything in it.

01:30.720 --> 01:33.360
The story, of course, has now gone viral on the internet.

01:34.160 --> 01:36.560
Now, it's no good going through volumes of journals

01:36.560 --> 01:40.160
trying to find out about the geology of Mars to prove this wrong.

01:40.160 --> 01:42.720
Just find out where the information comes from

01:42.720 --> 01:45.600
and start by looking through the Daily Mail story for a source.

01:46.240 --> 01:47.440
And here it is.

01:47.440 --> 01:52.400
The information came from an interview with someone called John Brandenburg on Fox News.

01:52.400 --> 01:56.240
So we googled John Brandenburg Fox News, and here's the story.

01:56.880 --> 01:59.280
Now, how does Brandenburg know all this?

01:59.280 --> 02:01.280
Well, there the trail goes cold.

02:01.280 --> 02:05.440
There's no study and no research paper quoted, just one man's opinion.

02:06.160 --> 02:09.600
For most journalists outside the field of science, that's all they need.

02:10.320 --> 02:14.160
But science isn't like history or economics or medieval art.

02:14.160 --> 02:18.080
The facts in science are easy to source because they all come from research

02:18.080 --> 02:20.960
that's been laid out in peer-reviewed scientific papers.

02:21.600 --> 02:23.920
So let's see if Brandenburg has written one.

02:24.560 --> 02:28.400
The best database of published papers is the ISI Web of Knowledge,

02:28.400 --> 02:30.320
now run by Thomson Reuters.

02:30.320 --> 02:33.520
Google Scholar is also an excellent resource.

02:33.520 --> 02:37.200
And yes, a search comes up with a paper by Brandenburg called

02:37.200 --> 02:40.960
Evidence for a Large Natural Paleonuclear Reactor on Mars.

02:41.520 --> 02:45.120
But this isn't a peer-reviewed paper in a scientific journal.

02:45.120 --> 02:48.000
This was just one of over 1800 papers

02:48.000 --> 02:51.520
submitted to the 42nd Lunar and Planetary Science Conference

02:51.520 --> 02:53.520
as matters of interest and discussion.

02:54.160 --> 02:57.120
The only other thing we have is a book by Brandenburg

02:57.120 --> 02:59.280
called Life and Death on Mars.

02:59.280 --> 03:02.800
And it makes some fairly extraordinary claims for what it calls

03:02.800 --> 03:06.480
the terrible truth that Mars was once just like the Earth

03:06.480 --> 03:09.040
with oceans and life and a civilization

03:09.040 --> 03:12.160
that was wiped out by that radioactive explosion.

03:12.160 --> 03:19.680
The Sidonian hypothesis was formulated by us based on the photographs

03:19.680 --> 03:24.000
from the Viking of what looks like the remains of the dead civilization,

03:24.000 --> 03:25.360
archaeological remnants.

03:26.080 --> 03:29.760
So despite the label science, the media have simply reprinted

03:29.760 --> 03:33.920
Brandenburg's speculation without the backing of any peer-reviewed paper.

03:34.560 --> 03:39.120
But what about that headline claiming Mars is red because of radioactivity?

03:39.120 --> 03:43.520
Surely everyone knows that Mars is reddish because of iron oxide in the soil.

03:44.080 --> 03:45.680
Well, not everyone apparently.

03:46.320 --> 03:50.480
The mail got its headline from a single line in the Fox News story.

03:50.480 --> 03:55.520
But the line isn't in quotation marks and isn't even attributed to John Brandenburg.

03:55.520 --> 03:58.320
In a recent radio interview, Brandenburg seems to accept

03:58.320 --> 04:02.560
that Mars is red because of oxidation, not radioactivity.

04:02.560 --> 04:06.080
You'll notice that Mars' surface is heavily oxidized.

04:06.080 --> 04:11.920
In fact, if you look at the Valles Marineris, the layers, they're bright red.

04:11.920 --> 04:15.520
I emailed Fox News to ask for a source in vain.

04:15.520 --> 04:19.520
But after a career watching badly written stories like this unfold,

04:19.520 --> 04:22.320
I've got a pretty good inkling as to what might have happened.

04:22.320 --> 04:25.360
Brandenburg probably told the reporter, John Brandon,

04:25.360 --> 04:28.080
that the nuclear explosion turned the planet red,

04:28.080 --> 04:31.200
meaning that it turned a lot of the iron-rich rock into dust

04:31.200 --> 04:32.800
and exposed it to oxidation.

04:33.440 --> 04:37.120
All Brandon heard was that the explosion caused Mars to turn red,

04:37.120 --> 04:42.400
and from his knowledge of the way radioactive material gives off a colorful glow in The Simpsons,

04:42.400 --> 04:46.000
he assumed this meant that the red color was due to radioactivity.

04:46.560 --> 04:51.760
That's what happens when you let a writer with no background in science loose on the science page.

04:52.880 --> 04:54.560
Then an editor at the Daily Mail,

04:54.560 --> 04:58.720
equally ignorant of the difference between radioactivity and oxidation,

04:58.720 --> 05:00.240
made the blunder a headline.

05:00.800 --> 05:06.640
Between them, Fox News and the Daily Mail turned what was already unsubstantiated speculation

05:06.640 --> 05:09.840
into a wonderful pas de deux of complete stupidity.

05:10.960 --> 05:14.480
So the information trail is a bit like a Chinese whisper.

05:14.480 --> 05:18.560
As a piece of information gets passed along, it can get distorted.

05:18.560 --> 05:23.840
It could be because of a misunderstanding, or it could be intentional misrepresentation.

05:23.840 --> 05:26.800
The only way to be sure of how the information started out

05:26.800 --> 05:31.280
is to go in the opposite direction and follow the trail back to its source.

05:31.280 --> 05:34.960
And in my experience, however many people tell you something,

05:34.960 --> 05:38.320
the trail nearly always does end in just one source.

05:38.880 --> 05:43.600
Now we can't do this with everything we hear, or we'd be hitting the books 24 hours a day,

05:43.600 --> 05:46.560
but we should be able to spot something that's a bit fishy.

05:47.200 --> 05:52.960
Again, in science, unlike history or economics, spotting something fishy is very easy.

05:52.960 --> 05:56.640
If a newspaper not renowned for fact-checking or accuracy

05:56.640 --> 06:00.640
makes a claim that's completely at odds with current scientific evidence,

06:00.640 --> 06:05.840
then either scientists are stupid, or they're lying, or the newspaper's got something wrong.

06:06.720 --> 06:11.280
As I've shown, the Internet is a great tool for tracking information back to its source

06:11.280 --> 06:13.360
and finding out how it's been altered.

06:13.360 --> 06:17.520
But it's also good at disseminating bad information to millions.

06:17.520 --> 06:19.440
It's rather like a screwdriver.

06:19.520 --> 06:23.360
You can use it to take apart a complex bit of machinery to see how it works,

06:23.360 --> 06:24.960
or why it's gone wrong,

06:24.960 --> 06:28.880
or you can stick it in your ear to see how far it goes before it meets resistance.

06:29.520 --> 06:33.440
Unfortunately, a lot of people would rather stick the screwdriver in their ear

06:33.440 --> 06:36.080
than undertake the simple act of undoing a screw.

06:37.040 --> 06:41.760
In my climate change series, I had the example of a claim that went viral over the Internet

06:41.760 --> 06:44.960
that NASA said the sun was responsible for global warming.

06:45.680 --> 06:49.040
Millions of people believed it without doing the simplest thing,

06:49.040 --> 06:53.760
clicking the links back to the actual NASA story to read it for themselves.

06:53.760 --> 06:56.880
Once you follow the Chinese whispers back to their source,

06:56.880 --> 07:00.000
you can see where along the chain the story was changed.

07:01.280 --> 07:05.280
Sometimes the sources are incomplete, and that does make them harder to trace.

07:05.840 --> 07:09.040
One way to do this is to take a chunk of text that they've written,

07:09.040 --> 07:11.840
because they nearly always copy and paste these things,

07:11.840 --> 07:14.400
and put it in Google to see where it leads.

07:14.400 --> 07:16.480
You'll find the myth repeated many times,

07:16.480 --> 07:19.760
but someone somewhere will give a source as to where it came from.

07:20.560 --> 07:24.400
But I would always be suspicious of anyone who's trying to hide his source.

07:24.400 --> 07:28.080
Why don't they want you to know where their information comes from?

07:28.080 --> 07:30.720
A good example is Conservopedia's webpage,

07:30.720 --> 07:34.800
Counter Examples to an Old Earth, because it's a mixed bag.

07:34.800 --> 07:38.560
The first counterexample has a link that doesn't even address the claim,

07:38.560 --> 07:40.000
let alone support it.

07:40.000 --> 07:42.240
The second one offers no source at all.

07:42.960 --> 07:44.720
So this brings me to the next point.

07:44.720 --> 07:46.480
What do we do when someone says,

07:46.480 --> 07:50.320
a study shows, or according to a paper in the journal of whatever?

07:50.880 --> 07:53.120
Well, do exactly what I said at the beginning,

07:53.120 --> 07:56.320
ask for a source, not just vague reminiscences.

07:56.960 --> 07:58.640
Most of the time when I ask this question,

07:58.640 --> 08:01.200
people can't tell me what study they're talking about,

08:01.200 --> 08:03.600
or name the paper they're referring to.

08:03.600 --> 08:07.360
It's more likely than not they simply heard from someone that there is a study,

08:07.360 --> 08:09.280
and took this claim at face value.

08:09.920 --> 08:12.560
Even if they can cite the paper, check it,

08:12.560 --> 08:15.040
because chances are, as with Christopher Monckton

08:15.040 --> 08:17.360
and his dozens of scientific papers,

08:17.360 --> 08:19.600
it's possible they're misrepresenting it,

08:19.600 --> 08:20.880
or they haven't even read it.

08:21.600 --> 08:25.040
When Chipster07 posted a message on my video forum,

08:25.040 --> 08:28.560
saying there was no correlation between CO2 levels and temperatures

08:28.560 --> 08:30.560
over the last 600 million years,

08:30.560 --> 08:32.800
I of course asked him for his source.

08:32.800 --> 08:35.440
The answer came back very authoritatively,

08:35.440 --> 08:38.800
to researchers, Berner and Scotties, and a website.

08:39.520 --> 08:40.800
So I checked the website.

08:41.440 --> 08:44.480
It gives a link to the research by Berner and Scotties,

08:44.480 --> 08:45.520
so click again.

08:46.080 --> 08:50.320
Scotties has compiled a graph of temperatures over the last 600 million years,

08:50.320 --> 08:54.400
but gives no conclusion about how this relates to CO2 levels.

08:54.400 --> 08:56.320
So that source doesn't support the claim.

08:56.880 --> 09:01.520
Berner has compiled a graph of CO2 levels over the last 550 million years,

09:01.520 --> 09:05.840
and according to him there is a correlation between CO2 levels and temperatures.

09:06.720 --> 09:10.160
So how can a website make a claim that completely contradicts

09:10.160 --> 09:12.720
a paper that's cited in support of it?

09:12.720 --> 09:13.680
Answer?

09:13.680 --> 09:15.920
When the website is run by this guy.

09:15.920 --> 09:17.520
It's been proven time and time again

09:17.520 --> 09:20.320
that reincarnation breaks no physical laws as we know them.

09:20.320 --> 09:23.600
When Cliff Clavin expounded his knowledge in the barroom at Cheers,

09:23.600 --> 09:26.480
he had an audience of less than a dozen people.

09:26.480 --> 09:29.840
These days, Cliffie would undoubtedly have his own website,

09:29.840 --> 09:32.640
and to disguise the fact that it's written by a mailman,

09:32.640 --> 09:34.240
he can make it anonymous,

09:34.240 --> 09:37.040
or he can give himself any title he likes,

09:37.040 --> 09:39.440
and claim a specialist background he doesn't have.

09:40.320 --> 09:44.160
So when Chipster07 quotes Berner and Scottease as his source,

09:44.160 --> 09:47.280
he's taking the word of the equivalent of a guy he met in a bar.

09:47.840 --> 09:51.520
Okay, there's a fancy website and it all sounds very plausible,

09:51.520 --> 09:55.440
but remember Cliff Clavin is only as good as his sources.

09:55.440 --> 09:58.720
Chipster07 never actually read Berner's paper,

09:58.720 --> 10:01.120
and neither did the guy who runs the website,

10:01.120 --> 10:05.520
or they both would have noticed that it says the complete opposite of what's being claimed.

10:06.320 --> 10:08.000
In the days before the internet,

10:08.000 --> 10:11.120
journalists did a lot of their initial research in cuts,

10:11.120 --> 10:13.600
old newspaper clippings kept on file.

10:13.600 --> 10:15.840
I once spent hours trying to track down a myth

10:15.840 --> 10:20.240
that Tokyo gets hit by a major earthquake once every 70 years,

10:20.240 --> 10:24.560
and I finally tracked it down to a single wire agency story in 1970

10:24.560 --> 10:28.480
that cited a research study, and was then badly misquoted.

10:29.280 --> 10:31.200
The myth is still around to this day.

10:31.920 --> 10:34.960
The story survived because it was widely disseminated,

10:34.960 --> 10:37.760
and we do tend to believe what everyone else believes,

10:37.760 --> 10:39.360
journalists included.

10:39.360 --> 10:43.680
But it used to take years for stories like these to pass into general mythology,

10:43.680 --> 10:47.920
because at least most newspapers had editors who required facts to be checked,

10:47.920 --> 10:50.400
and rumors were generally spread by word of mouth.

10:50.960 --> 10:55.600
Today it takes just a few hours, and any debunking is always belated.

10:55.600 --> 10:59.040
The days when journalists had to get on a telephone and speak to someone,

10:59.040 --> 11:02.000
or put on their coats and do face-to-face interviews,

11:02.000 --> 11:04.400
and witness events with their own eyes,

11:04.400 --> 11:07.120
sadly that's taken a backseat to the click of the mouse.

11:07.600 --> 11:10.640
An editor I've known for years was moaning recently that

11:10.640 --> 11:13.760
our new journalists spend all their time on the internet.

11:13.760 --> 11:18.480
Our willingness to drive screwdrivers into our brains rather than unlock the truth

11:18.480 --> 11:21.840
has led to a culture of gullibility that's astonishing

11:21.840 --> 11:23.760
in even the most intelligent writers.

11:24.400 --> 11:27.440
I was misled by the internet, whines Christopher Booker,

11:27.440 --> 11:31.760
after admitting a quote he printed about climate change was a complete fabrication.

11:32.320 --> 11:33.600
Poor baby.

11:33.600 --> 11:36.000
Blaming the internet for your gullibility

11:36.000 --> 11:39.280
is like blaming the screwdriver for your neurological impairment.

11:40.080 --> 11:44.000
Science is often seen as a difficult subject, and yes it is,

11:44.000 --> 11:48.480
because it's detailed, meticulous, and demands the highest possible accuracy.

11:48.480 --> 11:52.000
But those qualities also make it very easy to check.

11:52.000 --> 11:56.560
There's a mechanism for documenting facts that has survived for 200 years,

11:56.560 --> 11:59.840
and has given us all the technological achievements we enjoy today.

12:00.480 --> 12:02.560
But we have to be willing to consult it.

12:03.280 --> 12:04.880
Not everyone can, of course.

12:04.880 --> 12:07.840
Some papers aren't accessible without a subscription.

12:07.840 --> 12:10.000
Most are difficult to understand.

12:10.000 --> 12:14.160
So my advice is to go to the most reliable media on science subjects,

12:14.160 --> 12:18.640
which are the science magazines like Wired, Scientific American, and New Scientist.

12:19.280 --> 12:22.960
I obviously have to declare an interest because I used to work for the last one.

12:22.960 --> 12:27.520
But from that experience, I know that if I was doing a story on microbiology,

12:27.520 --> 12:31.200
it would be edited by someone with a degree in microbiology.

12:31.200 --> 12:36.720
A story on nuclear physics would be edited by the news editor who has a PhD in physics.

12:36.720 --> 12:40.640
And a lot of New Scientist readers are people who are specialists in their field,

12:40.640 --> 12:44.480
so the editorial staff know that any mistakes would be spotted,

12:44.480 --> 12:46.960
and New Scientist reputation would be at stake.

12:47.680 --> 12:52.560
Quality newspapers with science correspondents who actually have degrees in science

12:52.560 --> 12:56.320
are also a fairly reliable source of what's coming out of the scientific journals.

12:57.280 --> 13:01.600
Ultimately, the accuracy of what we believe is our responsibility,

13:01.600 --> 13:04.560
because where we source our information is entirely up to us.

13:05.200 --> 13:09.760
We can check the accuracy of stories ourselves and use reliable sources,

13:09.760 --> 13:12.480
or we can believe the Cliff Clavins of this world.

13:14.480 --> 13:19.280
Recent medical studies have shown that time zone transference, aka jet lag,

13:19.280 --> 13:21.840
not only can be very upsetting to one's metabolism,

13:21.840 --> 13:26.160
but also directly correlates to the loss of hair follicles.

13:28.560 --> 13:29.840
Are you a doctor?

13:29.840 --> 13:33.200
No, he's a flume.
