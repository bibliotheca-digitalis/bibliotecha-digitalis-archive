0	5360	When I was about 10 years old, a story was going around school that Coca-Cola was so bad for your teeth
5360	9360	that if you put a tooth in a glass of coke, it would dissolve overnight.
9360	13120	So when a tooth of mine fell out, I thought it would be fun to watch this happen.
13120	19440	I left the glass overnight, then all day, and then a week, and the tooth still wouldn't dissolve.
19440	21520	Now this should have told me something.
21520	25920	If I'd asked the kids at school how they knew that a tooth dissolved in Coca-Cola,
25920	29120	they probably would have said they'd heard it from other kids,
29120	31840	and the other kids would have got it from other kids.
31840	34560	And I would have thought, well, how the hell does anybody know?
35920	39520	It was only years later that I learned the key to examining and debunking
39520	42240	the floating pieces of fatuous information.
42240	44880	Just ask the question, how do you know?
44880	47680	Or to put it more specifically, what's your source?
48320	52400	I thought I'd kick off this series about science and the media by looking at sources,
52400	54640	because a lot of people have asked me about it.
54640	57680	How do we know whether to trust the information we get?
57680	59280	And where can we go to check it?
59840	66000	Interestingly enough, it harks back to the early Persian Empire, about 500 BC.
66000	71440	If you've ever fallen for this kind of barroom wisdom, don't worry, so do a lot of journalists.
71440	75600	Recently, someone sent me a message about an odd assertion in the Daily Mail
75600	79200	that a nuclear explosion on Mars 180 million years ago
79200	83040	turned the planet into a dusty, rubble-strewn radioactive desert,
83040	86080	and that Mars is red because of this radioactive material.
86640	89920	He was rightly sceptical and asked if there was anything in it.
90720	93360	The story, of course, has now gone viral on the internet.
94160	96560	Now, it's no good going through volumes of journals
96560	100160	trying to find out about the geology of Mars to prove this wrong.
100160	102720	Just find out where the information comes from
102720	105600	and start by looking through the Daily Mail story for a source.
106240	107440	And here it is.
107440	112400	The information came from an interview with someone called John Brandenburg on Fox News.
112400	116240	So we googled John Brandenburg Fox News, and here's the story.
116880	119280	Now, how does Brandenburg know all this?
119280	121280	Well, there the trail goes cold.
121280	125440	There's no study and no research paper quoted, just one man's opinion.
126160	129600	For most journalists outside the field of science, that's all they need.
130320	134160	But science isn't like history or economics or medieval art.
134160	138080	The facts in science are easy to source because they all come from research
138080	140960	that's been laid out in peer-reviewed scientific papers.
141600	143920	So let's see if Brandenburg has written one.
144560	148400	The best database of published papers is the ISI Web of Knowledge,
148400	150320	now run by Thomson Reuters.
150320	153520	Google Scholar is also an excellent resource.
153520	157200	And yes, a search comes up with a paper by Brandenburg called
157200	160960	Evidence for a Large Natural Paleonuclear Reactor on Mars.
161520	165120	But this isn't a peer-reviewed paper in a scientific journal.
165120	168000	This was just one of over 1800 papers
168000	171520	submitted to the 42nd Lunar and Planetary Science Conference
171520	173520	as matters of interest and discussion.
174160	177120	The only other thing we have is a book by Brandenburg
177120	179280	called Life and Death on Mars.
179280	182800	And it makes some fairly extraordinary claims for what it calls
182800	186480	the terrible truth that Mars was once just like the Earth
186480	189040	with oceans and life and a civilization
189040	192160	that was wiped out by that radioactive explosion.
192160	199680	The Sidonian hypothesis was formulated by us based on the photographs
199680	204000	from the Viking of what looks like the remains of the dead civilization,
204000	205360	archaeological remnants.
206080	209760	So despite the label science, the media have simply reprinted
209760	213920	Brandenburg's speculation without the backing of any peer-reviewed paper.
214560	219120	But what about that headline claiming Mars is red because of radioactivity?
219120	223520	Surely everyone knows that Mars is reddish because of iron oxide in the soil.
224080	225680	Well, not everyone apparently.
226320	230480	The mail got its headline from a single line in the Fox News story.
230480	235520	But the line isn't in quotation marks and isn't even attributed to John Brandenburg.
235520	238320	In a recent radio interview, Brandenburg seems to accept
238320	242560	that Mars is red because of oxidation, not radioactivity.
242560	246080	You'll notice that Mars' surface is heavily oxidized.
246080	251920	In fact, if you look at the Valles Marineris, the layers, they're bright red.
251920	255520	I emailed Fox News to ask for a source in vain.
255520	259520	But after a career watching badly written stories like this unfold,
259520	262320	I've got a pretty good inkling as to what might have happened.
262320	265360	Brandenburg probably told the reporter, John Brandon,
265360	268080	that the nuclear explosion turned the planet red,
268080	271200	meaning that it turned a lot of the iron-rich rock into dust
271200	272800	and exposed it to oxidation.
273440	277120	All Brandon heard was that the explosion caused Mars to turn red,
277120	282400	and from his knowledge of the way radioactive material gives off a colorful glow in The Simpsons,
282400	286000	he assumed this meant that the red color was due to radioactivity.
286560	291760	That's what happens when you let a writer with no background in science loose on the science page.
292880	294560	Then an editor at the Daily Mail,
294560	298720	equally ignorant of the difference between radioactivity and oxidation,
298720	300240	made the blunder a headline.
300800	306640	Between them, Fox News and the Daily Mail turned what was already unsubstantiated speculation
306640	309840	into a wonderful pas de deux of complete stupidity.
310960	314480	So the information trail is a bit like a Chinese whisper.
314480	318560	As a piece of information gets passed along, it can get distorted.
318560	323840	It could be because of a misunderstanding, or it could be intentional misrepresentation.
323840	326800	The only way to be sure of how the information started out
326800	331280	is to go in the opposite direction and follow the trail back to its source.
331280	334960	And in my experience, however many people tell you something,
334960	338320	the trail nearly always does end in just one source.
338880	343600	Now we can't do this with everything we hear, or we'd be hitting the books 24 hours a day,
343600	346560	but we should be able to spot something that's a bit fishy.
347200	352960	Again, in science, unlike history or economics, spotting something fishy is very easy.
352960	356640	If a newspaper not renowned for fact-checking or accuracy
356640	360640	makes a claim that's completely at odds with current scientific evidence,
360640	365840	then either scientists are stupid, or they're lying, or the newspaper's got something wrong.
366720	371280	As I've shown, the Internet is a great tool for tracking information back to its source
371280	373360	and finding out how it's been altered.
373360	377520	But it's also good at disseminating bad information to millions.
377520	379440	It's rather like a screwdriver.
379520	383360	You can use it to take apart a complex bit of machinery to see how it works,
383360	384960	or why it's gone wrong,
384960	388880	or you can stick it in your ear to see how far it goes before it meets resistance.
389520	393440	Unfortunately, a lot of people would rather stick the screwdriver in their ear
393440	396080	than undertake the simple act of undoing a screw.
397040	401760	In my climate change series, I had the example of a claim that went viral over the Internet
401760	404960	that NASA said the sun was responsible for global warming.
405680	409040	Millions of people believed it without doing the simplest thing,
409040	413760	clicking the links back to the actual NASA story to read it for themselves.
413760	416880	Once you follow the Chinese whispers back to their source,
416880	420000	you can see where along the chain the story was changed.
421280	425280	Sometimes the sources are incomplete, and that does make them harder to trace.
425840	429040	One way to do this is to take a chunk of text that they've written,
429040	431840	because they nearly always copy and paste these things,
431840	434400	and put it in Google to see where it leads.
434400	436480	You'll find the myth repeated many times,
436480	439760	but someone somewhere will give a source as to where it came from.
440560	444400	But I would always be suspicious of anyone who's trying to hide his source.
444400	448080	Why don't they want you to know where their information comes from?
448080	450720	A good example is Conservopedia's webpage,
450720	454800	Counter Examples to an Old Earth, because it's a mixed bag.
454800	458560	The first counterexample has a link that doesn't even address the claim,
458560	460000	let alone support it.
460000	462240	The second one offers no source at all.
462960	464720	So this brings me to the next point.
464720	466480	What do we do when someone says,
466480	470320	a study shows, or according to a paper in the journal of whatever?
470880	473120	Well, do exactly what I said at the beginning,
473120	476320	ask for a source, not just vague reminiscences.
476960	478640	Most of the time when I ask this question,
478640	481200	people can't tell me what study they're talking about,
481200	483600	or name the paper they're referring to.
483600	487360	It's more likely than not they simply heard from someone that there is a study,
487360	489280	and took this claim at face value.
489920	492560	Even if they can cite the paper, check it,
492560	495040	because chances are, as with Christopher Monckton
495040	497360	and his dozens of scientific papers,
497360	499600	it's possible they're misrepresenting it,
499600	500880	or they haven't even read it.
501600	505040	When Chipster07 posted a message on my video forum,
505040	508560	saying there was no correlation between CO2 levels and temperatures
508560	510560	over the last 600 million years,
510560	512800	I of course asked him for his source.
512800	515440	The answer came back very authoritatively,
515440	518800	to researchers, Berner and Scotties, and a website.
519520	520800	So I checked the website.
521440	524480	It gives a link to the research by Berner and Scotties,
524480	525520	so click again.
526080	530320	Scotties has compiled a graph of temperatures over the last 600 million years,
530320	534400	but gives no conclusion about how this relates to CO2 levels.
534400	536320	So that source doesn't support the claim.
536880	541520	Berner has compiled a graph of CO2 levels over the last 550 million years,
541520	545840	and according to him there is a correlation between CO2 levels and temperatures.
546720	550160	So how can a website make a claim that completely contradicts
550160	552720	a paper that's cited in support of it?
552720	553680	Answer?
553680	555920	When the website is run by this guy.
555920	557520	It's been proven time and time again
557520	560320	that reincarnation breaks no physical laws as we know them.
560320	563600	When Cliff Clavin expounded his knowledge in the barroom at Cheers,
563600	566480	he had an audience of less than a dozen people.
566480	569840	These days, Cliffie would undoubtedly have his own website,
569840	572640	and to disguise the fact that it's written by a mailman,
572640	574240	he can make it anonymous,
574240	577040	or he can give himself any title he likes,
577040	579440	and claim a specialist background he doesn't have.
580320	584160	So when Chipster07 quotes Berner and Scottease as his source,
584160	587280	he's taking the word of the equivalent of a guy he met in a bar.
587840	591520	Okay, there's a fancy website and it all sounds very plausible,
591520	595440	but remember Cliff Clavin is only as good as his sources.
595440	598720	Chipster07 never actually read Berner's paper,
598720	601120	and neither did the guy who runs the website,
601120	605520	or they both would have noticed that it says the complete opposite of what's being claimed.
606320	608000	In the days before the internet,
608000	611120	journalists did a lot of their initial research in cuts,
611120	613600	old newspaper clippings kept on file.
613600	615840	I once spent hours trying to track down a myth
615840	620240	that Tokyo gets hit by a major earthquake once every 70 years,
620240	624560	and I finally tracked it down to a single wire agency story in 1970
624560	628480	that cited a research study, and was then badly misquoted.
629280	631200	The myth is still around to this day.
631920	634960	The story survived because it was widely disseminated,
634960	637760	and we do tend to believe what everyone else believes,
637760	639360	journalists included.
639360	643680	But it used to take years for stories like these to pass into general mythology,
643680	647920	because at least most newspapers had editors who required facts to be checked,
647920	650400	and rumors were generally spread by word of mouth.
650960	655600	Today it takes just a few hours, and any debunking is always belated.
655600	659040	The days when journalists had to get on a telephone and speak to someone,
659040	662000	or put on their coats and do face-to-face interviews,
662000	664400	and witness events with their own eyes,
664400	667120	sadly that's taken a backseat to the click of the mouse.
667600	670640	An editor I've known for years was moaning recently that
670640	673760	our new journalists spend all their time on the internet.
673760	678480	Our willingness to drive screwdrivers into our brains rather than unlock the truth
678480	681840	has led to a culture of gullibility that's astonishing
681840	683760	in even the most intelligent writers.
684400	687440	I was misled by the internet, whines Christopher Booker,
687440	691760	after admitting a quote he printed about climate change was a complete fabrication.
692320	693600	Poor baby.
693600	696000	Blaming the internet for your gullibility
696000	699280	is like blaming the screwdriver for your neurological impairment.
700080	704000	Science is often seen as a difficult subject, and yes it is,
704000	708480	because it's detailed, meticulous, and demands the highest possible accuracy.
708480	712000	But those qualities also make it very easy to check.
712000	716560	There's a mechanism for documenting facts that has survived for 200 years,
716560	719840	and has given us all the technological achievements we enjoy today.
720480	722560	But we have to be willing to consult it.
723280	724880	Not everyone can, of course.
724880	727840	Some papers aren't accessible without a subscription.
727840	730000	Most are difficult to understand.
730000	734160	So my advice is to go to the most reliable media on science subjects,
734160	738640	which are the science magazines like Wired, Scientific American, and New Scientist.
739280	742960	I obviously have to declare an interest because I used to work for the last one.
742960	747520	But from that experience, I know that if I was doing a story on microbiology,
747520	751200	it would be edited by someone with a degree in microbiology.
751200	756720	A story on nuclear physics would be edited by the news editor who has a PhD in physics.
756720	760640	And a lot of New Scientist readers are people who are specialists in their field,
760640	764480	so the editorial staff know that any mistakes would be spotted,
764480	766960	and New Scientist reputation would be at stake.
767680	772560	Quality newspapers with science correspondents who actually have degrees in science
772560	776320	are also a fairly reliable source of what's coming out of the scientific journals.
777280	781600	Ultimately, the accuracy of what we believe is our responsibility,
781600	784560	because where we source our information is entirely up to us.
785200	789760	We can check the accuracy of stories ourselves and use reliable sources,
789760	792480	or we can believe the Cliff Clavins of this world.
794480	799280	Recent medical studies have shown that time zone transference, aka jet lag,
799280	801840	not only can be very upsetting to one's metabolism,
801840	806160	but also directly correlates to the loss of hair follicles.
808560	809840	Are you a doctor?
809840	813200	No, he's a flume.
