00:00.000 --> 00:03.280
Isn't it amazing? A tabloid newspaper runs a story,

00:03.280 --> 00:06.960
calls it Climate Gate 2, and the blogosphere lights up.

00:08.160 --> 00:11.920
According to the Mail, a retired scientist who worked for the NCEI,

00:11.920 --> 00:16.240
the National Centres for Environmental Information, said Noah breached protocol

00:16.240 --> 00:21.200
by fast-forwarding a flawed scientific paper that artificially raised temperatures

00:21.200 --> 00:25.040
and artificially erased the so-called pause in global warming.

00:25.040 --> 00:30.800
And without bothering to check the accuracy of the story, which comes from a newspaper

00:30.800 --> 00:35.840
famous for reporting a 50-foot crab off the coast of Whitstable, and a reporter with a

00:35.840 --> 00:40.720
history of making up spurious stories about climate science, bloggers and politicians

00:40.720 --> 00:46.080
announced it was all true. I thank Dr John Bates for courageously stepping forward to

00:46.080 --> 00:51.040
tell the truth about Noah's senior officials playing fast and loose with the data in order

00:51.040 --> 00:56.320
to meet a politically pre-determined conclusion. This endorsement came not from a blogger,

00:56.320 --> 01:01.360
but from senior members of the House Committee on Science, Space and Technology in Congress,

01:01.360 --> 01:05.440
within hours of publication and without even the need to check the story.

01:06.000 --> 01:07.520
So let's check it for them.

01:08.320 --> 01:13.440
There are two issues here. One is whether Noah fast-forwarded publication to get the paper

01:13.440 --> 01:19.200
published in time for the Paris climate meeting. That may be best answered by the publisher itself,

01:19.200 --> 01:24.960
Science, whose editor sent a copy of his email exchange with the Mail's reporter to Roz Pidcock.

01:25.600 --> 01:31.920
According to Science, the Noah paper by Tom Karl et al. took six months to thoroughly peer review,

01:31.920 --> 01:37.120
two months longer than normal, and all of the data were publicly available prior to publication.

01:37.840 --> 01:41.920
That sheds a bit more light on whether the paper was fast-forwarded,

01:41.920 --> 01:44.480
but none of this information was in the Mail story.

01:45.360 --> 01:48.080
Of course that doesn't mean protocols weren't breached,

01:48.080 --> 01:52.240
and that's a serious question and one that needs to be properly investigated.

01:53.120 --> 01:57.440
The other issue is whether the paper was flawed, and that's much easier to determine.

01:58.000 --> 02:01.840
The Karl paper explained that the so-called pause in global warming

02:01.840 --> 02:05.120
was probably the result of erroneous ocean temperature measurements.

02:05.760 --> 02:09.120
The pause refers to a slowdown at the beginning of this century

02:09.120 --> 02:13.440
in the rate of warming of the atmosphere, where about 8% of global warming is going.

02:14.000 --> 02:16.000
90% is going into the oceans.

02:16.720 --> 02:21.760
To put it simply, the trend line appears to go up more steeply in the 90s than in the noughties.

02:22.960 --> 02:26.800
So a lot of studies have been done by lots of different scientific institutions

02:26.800 --> 02:30.560
to try to find out why the atmospheric trend line changed,

02:30.560 --> 02:33.760
and it turns out to be most likely a combination of factors.

02:34.400 --> 02:37.520
Lower solar output, increasing aerosol pollution,

02:37.520 --> 02:41.040
and the transfer of extra heat into the oceans all play a part.

02:41.840 --> 02:46.400
And it was this transfer of heat into the oceans that NOAA was mostly concerned with,

02:46.400 --> 02:49.440
because that would show up in higher sea surface temperatures.

02:50.240 --> 02:53.280
In the old days, this temperature reading was always taken on ships.

02:53.840 --> 02:57.680
Then a system of buoys was set up to take these measurements.

02:57.680 --> 03:00.240
But researchers noticed a problem.

03:00.240 --> 03:05.120
The measurements from the ships was recording slightly higher temperatures than the buoys,

03:05.120 --> 03:08.080
because the intake of seawater was near the hot engine room.

03:08.880 --> 03:11.840
And as the number of readings from buoys increased,

03:11.840 --> 03:15.680
that difference, called a bias, was influencing the trend line.

03:16.240 --> 03:18.560
So crudely put, it goes like this.

03:18.560 --> 03:22.560
Temperature reading from a ship, temperature reading from a ship, temperature reading from a ship.

03:23.120 --> 03:27.760
Then we switch to a temperature reading from a buoy, and another reading from a buoy.

03:27.760 --> 03:33.120
Now obviously the ocean hasn't suddenly cooled, but if you publish this as a temperature graph,

03:33.120 --> 03:37.280
then it's going to look as though it has, so the data has to be adjusted.

03:37.280 --> 03:40.320
This is what caused consternation in the blogosphere,

03:40.320 --> 03:45.360
because those who don't understand the difference between temperature anomalies and trend lines

03:45.360 --> 03:48.640
thought NOAA was deliberately trying to push up temperatures.

03:49.200 --> 03:53.760
But according to the Mail, this newspaper has learnt that NOAA has now decided that the sea

03:53.760 --> 03:59.280
data set will have to be replaced and substantially revised just 18 months after it was issued,

03:59.280 --> 04:03.280
because it used unreliable methods which overstated the speed of warming.

04:03.920 --> 04:08.640
Well, the Mail may have just found out about it, but it wasn't a surprise to everybody else.

04:08.640 --> 04:12.640
The 2015 results were part of an ongoing series of studies

04:12.640 --> 04:18.640
under a programme called Extended Reconstruction Sea Surface Temperature, or IRST for short.

04:18.640 --> 04:25.440
The 2015 results were called IRST4, updating the previously much less accurate IRST3B.

04:26.480 --> 04:30.800
And when IRST5 comes out, that's the new data set the Mail is referring to,

04:30.800 --> 04:35.760
it'll be more accurate still. A preliminary report suggests it'll bring the trend down

04:35.760 --> 04:40.720
about 10% from IRST4, but it'll still be about 50% up from IRST3B.

04:41.440 --> 04:47.360
So contrary to the Mail's claim, IRST5 isn't being published because IRST4 used unreliable methods

04:47.360 --> 04:52.000
or overstated the speed of warming. It'll be published because it's part of a continuous

04:52.000 --> 04:55.840
process of updating and increasing the accuracy of data.

04:56.800 --> 05:01.360
Science rarely has eureka moments, it just gets more and more accurate,

05:01.360 --> 05:07.360
as more and better measurements are taken. IRST5 will itself be replaced by IRST6.

05:08.160 --> 05:12.160
So the updating of information is not evidence that the data set was flawed,

05:12.160 --> 05:16.880
let alone fraudulently manipulated. Perhaps the most damning evidence for

05:16.880 --> 05:20.480
that is this quote in the Mail story, supposedly from John Bates.

05:21.280 --> 05:21.760
He said,

05:33.280 --> 05:38.960
It's a line that's been repeated by bloggers, newspapers and TV networks that regularly run

05:38.960 --> 05:43.840
stories trying to undermine climate science. But did Bates really say that?

05:44.560 --> 05:49.040
David Rose has been accused of making up quotes by someone he interviewed before,

05:49.040 --> 05:53.920
and if he follows past practice, he'll refuse to release his notes or recordings of the Bates

05:53.920 --> 05:57.920
interview for verification. But fortunately, we can check what

05:57.920 --> 06:03.440
Bates actually did say on the subject elsewhere, without having David Rose act as our rather

06:03.440 --> 06:09.920
questionable interpreter. In his own words, on a climate blog run by Judith Curry,

06:09.920 --> 06:15.520
Bates explains the problem he has with the Carl paper and the archiving of the IRST4 data set.

06:16.400 --> 06:19.520
This was posted just before the Mail published its story,

06:19.520 --> 06:24.080
and the contrast is revealing. The link to this is in my video description,

06:24.080 --> 06:30.160
so take the time to read it. You'll see why the Mail chose to embellish Bates' actual complaints,

06:30.160 --> 06:35.360
because his actual complaints would have put their readers to sleep and not cause much of a stir.

06:36.560 --> 06:41.360
So what does Bates have to say about, they had good data from buoys and they threw it out?

06:42.160 --> 06:47.120
Funnily enough, absolutely nothing. His only mention of the procedure is here,

06:47.120 --> 06:53.360
and it's purely factual. For ocean temperatures, the IRST4 is used in the K15 paper,

06:53.360 --> 06:57.440
that's the Carl paper, and represents a major update from the previous version.

06:57.440 --> 07:01.760
The bias correction procedure was changed, and this resulted in different SST anomalies

07:01.760 --> 07:08.320
and different trends during the last 15 plus years relative to IRST3. Which of course is all true,

07:08.320 --> 07:12.080
and he certainly doesn't suggest good data from buoys was thrown out.

07:12.880 --> 07:18.000
And since the Mail story was published, Bates has reportedly told ClimateWire that he's not

07:18.000 --> 07:23.360
suggesting any malfeasance. The issue here is not an issue of tampering with data, but rather

07:23.360 --> 07:28.240
really of timing of a release of a paper that had not properly disclosed everything it was, he said.

07:29.440 --> 07:31.760
And he told Associated Press the same thing.

07:32.560 --> 07:36.960
It's really a story of not disclosing what you did, Bates said in the interview,

07:36.960 --> 07:42.880
it's not trumped up data in any way, shape or form. But whether Bates said Noah was throwing

07:42.880 --> 07:49.200
out good data or Rose did, it's complete nonsense anyway. Noah didn't throw out the good data from

07:49.200 --> 07:55.680
buoys at all, they did completely the opposite. Instead of relying mostly on ship data, IRST4

07:55.680 --> 08:01.280
researchers overwhelmingly favoured data from buoys, as is explained in all the published

08:01.280 --> 08:06.400
research. And if the reference to changing good data is a reference to adjusting the temperature

08:06.400 --> 08:11.520
data to take account of the difference between ships and buoys, then it's absurd to claim that

08:11.520 --> 08:17.120
this is throwing out good data. No one in climate research disagrees with the decision to eliminate

08:17.120 --> 08:22.960
the bias, not even Bates. If it hadn't been done, the record would be showing a spurious temperature

08:22.960 --> 08:28.000
drop, which I'm sure is what David Rose would like to see, but it doesn't match reality.

08:29.200 --> 08:34.880
Whatever objections Rose has to the way it was done, the way it was done turned out to be right.

08:34.880 --> 08:41.760
A January 2017 paper by Zeke Housefather et al. confirmed the validity of the Noah adjustments,

08:41.760 --> 08:46.160
and concluded that they agreed with what other scientific institutions had found,

08:46.160 --> 08:52.080
including Berkeley Earth, the Hadley Centre in the UK, and the Japan Meteorological Agency.

08:52.080 --> 08:58.480
All get the same results as Noah. Rose tried to substantiate his claims with a graph,

08:58.480 --> 09:04.000
which purports to show that Noah is fraudulently raising temperatures. In fact, all it shows is

09:04.000 --> 09:09.040
that the male doesn't understand temperature reconstructions. They're not showing global

09:09.040 --> 09:14.720
temperatures, they're showing global temperature anomalies. Different institutions use different

09:14.720 --> 09:20.320
baselines. That makes no difference to absolute temperatures or temperature trends. These graphs

09:20.320 --> 09:25.360
show the variance of those temperatures from different averages in the past. Hadley uses

09:25.360 --> 09:32.960
the baseline 1961 to 1990, while Noah uses the baseline 1901 to 2000. Putting these together

09:32.960 --> 09:38.240
without adjusting the baseline is like putting two graphs together, one measuring Fahrenheit

09:38.240 --> 09:42.720
and the other measuring centigrade and claiming that the Fahrenheit graph shows more warming.

09:43.520 --> 09:48.560
The male also claims, in the caption, that the graph reveals that Noah has been adjusted

09:48.560 --> 09:54.000
to show a steeper warming trend. But of course it does nothing of the sort. All it reveals is that

09:54.000 --> 09:59.680
the male doesn't understand how to put two graphs on the same baseline, so that we can compare them

09:59.680 --> 10:06.160
and see what the trend is. Fortunately for us, Housefather has done just that. And guess what?

10:06.720 --> 10:12.560
The trend is exactly the same. Why didn't the male put the two graphs on the same baseline?

10:12.560 --> 10:17.840
Because if they had, they would have proved that the Noah dataset agrees perfectly with verified

10:17.840 --> 10:23.760
data from Hadley. And that's not the conclusion their readers want to hear. Taken together with

10:23.760 --> 10:29.520
the land data, the Noah trend again shows no slowdown in global warming. Not just from Noah,

10:29.520 --> 10:34.160
but from other scientific institutions as well, like Berkeley Earth, NASA and

10:34.160 --> 10:40.800
Canton and Way. They all show no global warming pause. There are a lot more errors in the male

10:40.800 --> 10:45.840
story, and if I was doing my usual month-long investigation, I'd go in-depth and pick it apart

10:45.840 --> 10:50.320
in more detail. But at least I've done some checking, which is more than can be said for

10:50.320 --> 10:56.400
the bloggers and the politicians who immediately proclaimed the story true. So I'm not saying

10:56.400 --> 11:01.840
accusations by tabloid newspapers should be dismissed, but they should at least be checked,

11:01.840 --> 11:07.200
especially those with a history of getting their facts wrong. What's really shocking is that the

11:07.200 --> 11:11.840
House Committee on Science, Space and Technology, which oversees science on behalf of the most

11:11.840 --> 11:17.920
powerful country in the world, is happy to blindly believe a tabloid newspaper that says Noah got it

11:17.920 --> 11:23.200
wrong, rather than peer-reviewed scientific papers that verified Noah's conclusions,

11:23.200 --> 11:27.200
and scientific institutions around the world that got exactly the same results.

11:28.320 --> 11:31.680
Maybe the House Committee on Science, Space and Technology's next job

11:31.680 --> 11:37.520
should be to prepare defences against Crabzilla. It must be true. It's in the mail.
