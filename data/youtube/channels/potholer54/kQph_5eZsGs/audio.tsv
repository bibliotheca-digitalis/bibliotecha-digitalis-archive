0	3280	Isn't it amazing? A tabloid newspaper runs a story,
3280	6960	calls it Climate Gate 2, and the blogosphere lights up.
8160	11920	According to the Mail, a retired scientist who worked for the NCEI,
11920	16240	the National Centres for Environmental Information, said Noah breached protocol
16240	21200	by fast-forwarding a flawed scientific paper that artificially raised temperatures
21200	25040	and artificially erased the so-called pause in global warming.
25040	30800	And without bothering to check the accuracy of the story, which comes from a newspaper
30800	35840	famous for reporting a 50-foot crab off the coast of Whitstable, and a reporter with a
35840	40720	history of making up spurious stories about climate science, bloggers and politicians
40720	46080	announced it was all true. I thank Dr John Bates for courageously stepping forward to
46080	51040	tell the truth about Noah's senior officials playing fast and loose with the data in order
51040	56320	to meet a politically pre-determined conclusion. This endorsement came not from a blogger,
56320	61360	but from senior members of the House Committee on Science, Space and Technology in Congress,
61360	65440	within hours of publication and without even the need to check the story.
66000	67520	So let's check it for them.
68320	73440	There are two issues here. One is whether Noah fast-forwarded publication to get the paper
73440	79200	published in time for the Paris climate meeting. That may be best answered by the publisher itself,
79200	84960	Science, whose editor sent a copy of his email exchange with the Mail's reporter to Roz Pidcock.
85600	91920	According to Science, the Noah paper by Tom Karl et al. took six months to thoroughly peer review,
91920	97120	two months longer than normal, and all of the data were publicly available prior to publication.
97840	101920	That sheds a bit more light on whether the paper was fast-forwarded,
101920	104480	but none of this information was in the Mail story.
105360	108080	Of course that doesn't mean protocols weren't breached,
108080	112240	and that's a serious question and one that needs to be properly investigated.
113120	117440	The other issue is whether the paper was flawed, and that's much easier to determine.
118000	121840	The Karl paper explained that the so-called pause in global warming
121840	125120	was probably the result of erroneous ocean temperature measurements.
125760	129120	The pause refers to a slowdown at the beginning of this century
129120	133440	in the rate of warming of the atmosphere, where about 8% of global warming is going.
134000	136000	90% is going into the oceans.
136720	141760	To put it simply, the trend line appears to go up more steeply in the 90s than in the noughties.
142960	146800	So a lot of studies have been done by lots of different scientific institutions
146800	150560	to try to find out why the atmospheric trend line changed,
150560	153760	and it turns out to be most likely a combination of factors.
154400	157520	Lower solar output, increasing aerosol pollution,
157520	161040	and the transfer of extra heat into the oceans all play a part.
161840	166400	And it was this transfer of heat into the oceans that NOAA was mostly concerned with,
166400	169440	because that would show up in higher sea surface temperatures.
170240	173280	In the old days, this temperature reading was always taken on ships.
173840	177680	Then a system of buoys was set up to take these measurements.
177680	180240	But researchers noticed a problem.
180240	185120	The measurements from the ships was recording slightly higher temperatures than the buoys,
185120	188080	because the intake of seawater was near the hot engine room.
188880	191840	And as the number of readings from buoys increased,
191840	195680	that difference, called a bias, was influencing the trend line.
196240	198560	So crudely put, it goes like this.
198560	202560	Temperature reading from a ship, temperature reading from a ship, temperature reading from a ship.
203120	207760	Then we switch to a temperature reading from a buoy, and another reading from a buoy.
207760	213120	Now obviously the ocean hasn't suddenly cooled, but if you publish this as a temperature graph,
213120	217280	then it's going to look as though it has, so the data has to be adjusted.
217280	220320	This is what caused consternation in the blogosphere,
220320	225360	because those who don't understand the difference between temperature anomalies and trend lines
225360	228640	thought NOAA was deliberately trying to push up temperatures.
229200	233760	But according to the Mail, this newspaper has learnt that NOAA has now decided that the sea
233760	239280	data set will have to be replaced and substantially revised just 18 months after it was issued,
239280	243280	because it used unreliable methods which overstated the speed of warming.
243920	248640	Well, the Mail may have just found out about it, but it wasn't a surprise to everybody else.
248640	252640	The 2015 results were part of an ongoing series of studies
252640	258640	under a programme called Extended Reconstruction Sea Surface Temperature, or IRST for short.
258640	265440	The 2015 results were called IRST4, updating the previously much less accurate IRST3B.
266480	270800	And when IRST5 comes out, that's the new data set the Mail is referring to,
270800	275760	it'll be more accurate still. A preliminary report suggests it'll bring the trend down
275760	280720	about 10% from IRST4, but it'll still be about 50% up from IRST3B.
281440	287360	So contrary to the Mail's claim, IRST5 isn't being published because IRST4 used unreliable methods
287360	292000	or overstated the speed of warming. It'll be published because it's part of a continuous
292000	295840	process of updating and increasing the accuracy of data.
296800	301360	Science rarely has eureka moments, it just gets more and more accurate,
301360	307360	as more and better measurements are taken. IRST5 will itself be replaced by IRST6.
308160	312160	So the updating of information is not evidence that the data set was flawed,
312160	316880	let alone fraudulently manipulated. Perhaps the most damning evidence for
316880	320480	that is this quote in the Mail story, supposedly from John Bates.
321280	321760	He said,
333280	338960	It's a line that's been repeated by bloggers, newspapers and TV networks that regularly run
338960	343840	stories trying to undermine climate science. But did Bates really say that?
344560	349040	David Rose has been accused of making up quotes by someone he interviewed before,
349040	353920	and if he follows past practice, he'll refuse to release his notes or recordings of the Bates
353920	357920	interview for verification. But fortunately, we can check what
357920	363440	Bates actually did say on the subject elsewhere, without having David Rose act as our rather
363440	369920	questionable interpreter. In his own words, on a climate blog run by Judith Curry,
369920	375520	Bates explains the problem he has with the Carl paper and the archiving of the IRST4 data set.
376400	379520	This was posted just before the Mail published its story,
379520	384080	and the contrast is revealing. The link to this is in my video description,
384080	390160	so take the time to read it. You'll see why the Mail chose to embellish Bates' actual complaints,
390160	395360	because his actual complaints would have put their readers to sleep and not cause much of a stir.
396560	401360	So what does Bates have to say about, they had good data from buoys and they threw it out?
402160	407120	Funnily enough, absolutely nothing. His only mention of the procedure is here,
407120	413360	and it's purely factual. For ocean temperatures, the IRST4 is used in the K15 paper,
413360	417440	that's the Carl paper, and represents a major update from the previous version.
417440	421760	The bias correction procedure was changed, and this resulted in different SST anomalies
421760	428320	and different trends during the last 15 plus years relative to IRST3. Which of course is all true,
428320	432080	and he certainly doesn't suggest good data from buoys was thrown out.
432880	438000	And since the Mail story was published, Bates has reportedly told ClimateWire that he's not
438000	443360	suggesting any malfeasance. The issue here is not an issue of tampering with data, but rather
443360	448240	really of timing of a release of a paper that had not properly disclosed everything it was, he said.
449440	451760	And he told Associated Press the same thing.
452560	456960	It's really a story of not disclosing what you did, Bates said in the interview,
456960	462880	it's not trumped up data in any way, shape or form. But whether Bates said Noah was throwing
462880	469200	out good data or Rose did, it's complete nonsense anyway. Noah didn't throw out the good data from
469200	475680	buoys at all, they did completely the opposite. Instead of relying mostly on ship data, IRST4
475680	481280	researchers overwhelmingly favoured data from buoys, as is explained in all the published
481280	486400	research. And if the reference to changing good data is a reference to adjusting the temperature
486400	491520	data to take account of the difference between ships and buoys, then it's absurd to claim that
491520	497120	this is throwing out good data. No one in climate research disagrees with the decision to eliminate
497120	502960	the bias, not even Bates. If it hadn't been done, the record would be showing a spurious temperature
502960	508000	drop, which I'm sure is what David Rose would like to see, but it doesn't match reality.
509200	514880	Whatever objections Rose has to the way it was done, the way it was done turned out to be right.
514880	521760	A January 2017 paper by Zeke Housefather et al. confirmed the validity of the Noah adjustments,
521760	526160	and concluded that they agreed with what other scientific institutions had found,
526160	532080	including Berkeley Earth, the Hadley Centre in the UK, and the Japan Meteorological Agency.
532080	538480	All get the same results as Noah. Rose tried to substantiate his claims with a graph,
538480	544000	which purports to show that Noah is fraudulently raising temperatures. In fact, all it shows is
544000	549040	that the male doesn't understand temperature reconstructions. They're not showing global
549040	554720	temperatures, they're showing global temperature anomalies. Different institutions use different
554720	560320	baselines. That makes no difference to absolute temperatures or temperature trends. These graphs
560320	565360	show the variance of those temperatures from different averages in the past. Hadley uses
565360	572960	the baseline 1961 to 1990, while Noah uses the baseline 1901 to 2000. Putting these together
572960	578240	without adjusting the baseline is like putting two graphs together, one measuring Fahrenheit
578240	582720	and the other measuring centigrade and claiming that the Fahrenheit graph shows more warming.
583520	588560	The male also claims, in the caption, that the graph reveals that Noah has been adjusted
588560	594000	to show a steeper warming trend. But of course it does nothing of the sort. All it reveals is that
594000	599680	the male doesn't understand how to put two graphs on the same baseline, so that we can compare them
599680	606160	and see what the trend is. Fortunately for us, Housefather has done just that. And guess what?
606720	612560	The trend is exactly the same. Why didn't the male put the two graphs on the same baseline?
612560	617840	Because if they had, they would have proved that the Noah dataset agrees perfectly with verified
617840	623760	data from Hadley. And that's not the conclusion their readers want to hear. Taken together with
623760	629520	the land data, the Noah trend again shows no slowdown in global warming. Not just from Noah,
629520	634160	but from other scientific institutions as well, like Berkeley Earth, NASA and
634160	640800	Canton and Way. They all show no global warming pause. There are a lot more errors in the male
640800	645840	story, and if I was doing my usual month-long investigation, I'd go in-depth and pick it apart
645840	650320	in more detail. But at least I've done some checking, which is more than can be said for
650320	656400	the bloggers and the politicians who immediately proclaimed the story true. So I'm not saying
656400	661840	accusations by tabloid newspapers should be dismissed, but they should at least be checked,
661840	667200	especially those with a history of getting their facts wrong. What's really shocking is that the
667200	671840	House Committee on Science, Space and Technology, which oversees science on behalf of the most
671840	677920	powerful country in the world, is happy to blindly believe a tabloid newspaper that says Noah got it
677920	683200	wrong, rather than peer-reviewed scientific papers that verified Noah's conclusions,
683200	687200	and scientific institutions around the world that got exactly the same results.
688320	691680	Maybe the House Committee on Science, Space and Technology's next job
691680	697520	should be to prepare defences against Crabzilla. It must be true. It's in the mail.
