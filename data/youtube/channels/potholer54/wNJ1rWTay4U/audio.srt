00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,180
I have a couple of important announcements to make and then a bit of

2
00:00:05,180 --> 00:00:05,880
feedback.

3
00:00:05,880 --> 00:00:10,020
First, could the person who's running the Pottola 54 Facebook page

4
00:00:10,020 --> 00:00:13,820
please get in touch with me? You wrote me a while back but unfortunately I had a

5
00:00:13,820 --> 00:00:15,540
hard disk crash last October

6
00:00:15,540 --> 00:00:19,020
and lost your details. For those who have written to the site

7
00:00:19,020 --> 00:00:23,600
I can't access it so I'm afraid I can't respond. Second, good news for all those

8
00:00:23,600 --> 00:00:26,860
who've been asking for higher quality videos of the Made Easy series

9
00:00:26,860 --> 00:00:30,740
which you'll find in a playlist on this channel. Well the good news is I've now

10
00:00:30,740 --> 00:00:33,600
uploaded DVD quality videos of the series

11
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:37,040
onto a new YouTube channel specifically for downloading

12
00:00:37,040 --> 00:00:41,780
called Made Easy Series. You'll find the URL in this video description

13
00:00:41,780 --> 00:00:45,500
and on my channel. This is the revised version of the series

14
00:00:45,500 --> 00:00:49,460
without the religious content and with mistakes corrected so I'm pleased to say

15
00:00:49,460 --> 00:00:52,680
it's already being used in a number of schools and universities.
