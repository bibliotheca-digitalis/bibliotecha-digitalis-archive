I have a couple of important announcements to make and then a bit of

00:05.180 --> 00:05.880
feedback.

00:05.880 --> 00:10.020
First, could the person who's running the Pottola 54 Facebook page

00:10.020 --> 00:13.820
please get in touch with me? You wrote me a while back but unfortunately I had a

00:13.820 --> 00:15.540
hard disk crash last October

00:15.540 --> 00:19.020
and lost your details. For those who have written to the site

00:19.020 --> 00:23.600
I can't access it so I'm afraid I can't respond. Second, good news for all those

00:23.600 --> 00:26.860
who've been asking for higher quality videos of the Made Easy series

00:26.860 --> 00:30.740
which you'll find in a playlist on this channel. Well the good news is I've now

00:30.740 --> 00:33.600
uploaded DVD quality videos of the series

00:33.600 --> 00:37.040
onto a new YouTube channel specifically for downloading

00:37.040 --> 00:41.780
called Made Easy Series. You'll find the URL in this video description

00:41.780 --> 00:45.500
and on my channel. This is the revised version of the series

00:45.500 --> 00:49.460
without the religious content and with mistakes corrected so I'm pleased to say

00:49.460 --> 00:52.680
it's already being used in a number of schools and universities.
