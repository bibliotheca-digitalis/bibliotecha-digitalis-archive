0	5180	I have a couple of important announcements to make and then a bit of
5180	5880	feedback.
5880	10020	First, could the person who's running the Pottola 54 Facebook page
10020	13820	please get in touch with me? You wrote me a while back but unfortunately I had a
13820	15540	hard disk crash last October
15540	19020	and lost your details. For those who have written to the site
19020	23600	I can't access it so I'm afraid I can't respond. Second, good news for all those
23600	26860	who've been asking for higher quality videos of the Made Easy series
26860	30740	which you'll find in a playlist on this channel. Well the good news is I've now
30740	33600	uploaded DVD quality videos of the series
33600	37040	onto a new YouTube channel specifically for downloading
37040	41780	called Made Easy Series. You'll find the URL in this video description
41780	45500	and on my channel. This is the revised version of the series
45500	49460	without the religious content and with mistakes corrected so I'm pleased to say
49460	52680	it's already being used in a number of schools and universities.
