{"text": " I have a couple of important announcements to make and then a bit of feedback. First, could the person who's running the Pottola 54 Facebook page please get in touch with me? You wrote me a while back but unfortunately I had a hard disk crash last October and lost your details. For those who have written to the site I can't access it so I'm afraid I can't respond. Second, good news for all those who've been asking for higher quality videos of the Made Easy series which you'll find in a playlist on this channel. Well the good news is I've now uploaded DVD quality videos of the series onto a new YouTube channel specifically for downloading called Made Easy Series. You'll find the URL in this video description and on my channel. This is the revised version of the series without the religious content and with mistakes corrected so I'm pleased to say it's already being used in a number of schools and universities.", "segments": [{"id": 0, "seek": 0, "start": 0.0, "end": 5.18, "text": " I have a couple of important announcements to make and then a bit of", "tokens": [50363, 314, 423, 257, 3155, 286, 1593, 24009, 284, 787, 290, 788, 257, 1643, 286, 50622], "temperature": 0.0, "avg_logprob": -0.16801051933224462, "compression_ratio": 1.5361842105263157, "no_speech_prob": 0.026281127706170082}, {"id": 1, "seek": 0, "start": 5.18, "end": 5.88, "text": " feedback.", "tokens": [50622, 7538, 13, 50657], "temperature": 0.0, "avg_logprob": -0.16801051933224462, "compression_ratio": 1.5361842105263157, "no_speech_prob": 0.026281127706170082}, {"id": 2, "seek": 0, "start": 5.88, "end": 10.02, "text": " First, could the person who's running the Pottola 54 Facebook page", "tokens": [50657, 3274, 11, 714, 262, 1048, 508, 338, 2491, 262, 350, 1252, 5708, 7175, 3203, 2443, 50864], "temperature": 0.0, "avg_logprob": -0.16801051933224462, "compression_ratio": 1.5361842105263157, "no_speech_prob": 0.026281127706170082}, {"id": 3, "seek": 0, "start": 10.02, "end": 13.82, "text": " please get in touch with me?
