1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,080
Up to now I've had eight heart attacks.

2
00:00:02,080 --> 00:00:04,400
I've had colitis for four years.

3
00:00:04,400 --> 00:00:06,880
I have had edema for about 20 years.

4
00:00:06,880 --> 00:00:09,520
I was diagnosed with diabetes nine months ago.

5
00:00:09,520 --> 00:00:10,720
Well yeah, I thought I was going to die.

6
00:00:10,720 --> 00:00:13,120
Okay, there's a catalogue of ailments here.

7
00:00:13,120 --> 00:00:14,480
Can they be cured?

8
00:00:14,480 --> 00:00:15,840
Maybe a change of mood music?

9
00:00:16,480 --> 00:00:18,000
160 pounds.

10
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:20,960
I've seen a 50% at least reduction.

11
00:00:20,960 --> 00:00:26,560
I first noticed my edema going away about four days into this movie.

12
00:00:26,560 --> 00:00:29,200
I thought, you know, just never gonna reverse.

13
00:00:29,200 --> 00:00:32,320
Well here it is six months later and I don't have cancer anymore.

14
00:00:32,320 --> 00:00:34,800
What? Don't have cancer anymore?

15
00:00:35,440 --> 00:00:37,760
Well it can't be the mood music that did it.

16
00:00:37,760 --> 00:00:40,640
So what has cured all of these people of their ailments?

17
00:00:40,640 --> 00:00:44,800
And the raw food drew and pulled excess mucus out of them.

18
00:00:44,800 --> 00:00:47,280
That's right, eating raw vegetables and fruit.

19
00:00:47,840 --> 00:00:51,600
Now I don't want to dismiss the idea that eating fruit and veg is good for you.

20
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:53,920
Just about every doctor will tell you this.

21
00:00:53,920 --> 00:00:57,760
And we're all aware that a diet rich in the sort of things you find in processed food

22
00:00:57,760 --> 00:01:03,600
like sugar, salt and fat can cause everything from diabetes to arterial sclerosis.

23
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:07,760
So changing to a fruit and veg diet certainly helps alleviate these problems.

24
00:01:08,480 --> 00:01:11,440
But the author of this video goes much further.

25
00:01:11,440 --> 00:01:17,600
Documenting 37 cases of a fruit and veg diet curing everything from psoriasis to cancer.

26
00:01:18,160 --> 00:01:19,440
And further still.

27
00:01:19,440 --> 00:01:25,040
It is as natural for a human to be healthy as it is for water to flow downward.

28
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:30,080
Being unwell is about as unnatural as for water to flow backwards.

29
00:01:31,280 --> 00:01:33,360
So who's making such ridiculous claims?

30
00:01:34,720 --> 00:01:40,320
Sorry, this is Valia Butenko and her belief that sickness and disease simply wouldn't happen

31
00:01:40,320 --> 00:01:43,120
if only we ate nothing but raw vegetables and fruit.

32
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:45,520
Look, see, she can run uphill.

33
00:01:45,520 --> 00:01:48,560
Is promoted in a website I've come across before.

34
00:01:48,560 --> 00:01:49,520
Natural news.

35
00:01:50,240 --> 00:01:54,960
Without, apparently, bothering to check any of the testimonials presented in her video,

36
00:01:54,960 --> 00:01:58,480
natural news stated that they were documented and true.

37
00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:03,440
But then natural news has form when it comes to spreading junk science

38
00:02:03,440 --> 00:02:06,880
and theories that scientists are conspiring to harm us all.

39
00:02:06,880 --> 00:02:08,560
Here's one that catches the eye.

40
00:02:09,120 --> 00:02:09,760
Exposed!

41
00:02:09,760 --> 00:02:14,000
The Centre for Disease Control deliberately manipulated, covered up scientific data,

42
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:17,040
showing link between vaccines containing mercury and autism.

43
00:02:18,320 --> 00:02:21,840
Now this has been in the news over the last few years, so the discovery that one of the

44
00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:27,360
institutions at the heart of promoting vaccines has been covering up a link between the vaccines

45
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:30,880
and autism is, well, news breaking stuff.

46
00:02:31,520 --> 00:02:35,120
So why haven't I seen it anywhere except natural news?

47
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:39,760
Well, as usual, if we want to check a fact, what do we do?

48
00:02:39,760 --> 00:02:41,040
Find out where it comes from.

49
00:02:42,160 --> 00:02:43,120
That's right.

50
00:02:43,120 --> 00:02:45,520
So let's check where this claim comes from.

51
00:02:45,520 --> 00:02:46,400
What's the source?

52
00:02:47,040 --> 00:02:49,920
Apparently the information comes from an organisation called

53
00:02:49,920 --> 00:02:53,440
the Coalition for Mercury-Free Drugs, COMED.

54
00:02:53,440 --> 00:02:56,240
They obtained a copy of an email from the CDC

55
00:02:56,240 --> 00:03:00,240
discussing a Danish study that was to be published in the journal Pediatrics.

56
00:03:00,960 --> 00:03:03,680
The Danish study looked at the prevalence of autism following

57
00:03:03,680 --> 00:03:07,840
the withdrawal of a preservative called thimerosal in 1992.

58
00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:10,960
If this mercury compound really did cause autism,

59
00:03:10,960 --> 00:03:14,800
we ought to see a drop in the number of cases after it was withdrawn, right?

60
00:03:15,600 --> 00:03:17,360
And according to COMED, we do.

61
00:03:18,160 --> 00:03:21,040
Documents obtained via the Freedom of Information Act

62
00:03:21,040 --> 00:03:24,080
show that CDC officials were aware of Danish data

63
00:03:24,080 --> 00:03:29,280
indicating a connection between removing thimerosal and a decline in autism rates.

64
00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:32,560
Despite this knowledge, these officials allowed a 2003 article

65
00:03:32,560 --> 00:03:36,240
to be published in Pediatrics that excluded this information.

66
00:03:37,120 --> 00:03:40,400
Before we go on, what is this information that's been excluded?

67
00:03:41,040 --> 00:03:46,800
Well, it was the latest figures for autism rates in Denmark at that time, covering 2001.

68
00:03:46,880 --> 00:03:51,600
And according to the email, these show a continuation of the decline in autism rates.

69
00:03:51,600 --> 00:03:56,400
So according to COMED, autism rates dropped after the vaccine was withdrawn

70
00:03:56,400 --> 00:04:00,160
and figures showing that this drop continued were deliberately excluded.

71
00:04:00,720 --> 00:04:03,680
This would seem to be slam dunk evidence of a conspiracy

72
00:04:03,680 --> 00:04:05,840
of government and science of the highest order.

73
00:04:06,560 --> 00:04:10,000
Ah, until you look at the figures COMED is talking about.

74
00:04:11,200 --> 00:04:14,000
Remember how it said rates of autism dropped in Denmark

75
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,720
when the vaccine was withdrawn in 1992?

76
00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:19,760
Well, guess what? Turns out they did the opposite.

77
00:04:19,760 --> 00:04:20,480
They rose.

78
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:24,000
And remember that decline that was talked about?

79
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:30,560
Well, that didn't happen until around 1999, seven years after the vaccine was withdrawn.

80
00:04:30,560 --> 00:04:34,080
And the 2001 figure that was simply a continuation of the decline?

81
00:04:34,080 --> 00:04:37,360
Well, that was nine years after the vaccine was withdrawn

82
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:39,520
and therefore hardly relevant to the study.

83
00:04:40,240 --> 00:04:42,480
Leaving it out didn't change the picture at all.

84
00:04:43,200 --> 00:04:48,080
Now, the folks at COMED weren't suggesting that the figures prior to 2001 had been manipulated.

85
00:04:48,080 --> 00:04:52,800
They simply didn't tell us there was a seven year gap between the withdrawal of a vaccine

86
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:55,920
and the supposedly linked decline in autism.

87
00:04:55,920 --> 00:04:59,520
In fact, if one looks at the graph through the eyes of a witless person,

88
00:04:59,520 --> 00:05:02,400
one who understands very little about cause and effect,

89
00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:06,080
one could more readily conclude that thimerosal prevents autism

90
00:05:06,080 --> 00:05:09,200
because as soon as it's withdrawn, autism rates soar.

91
00:05:10,080 --> 00:05:14,480
But of course, no researcher would make such a sweeping and unsubstantiated inference

92
00:05:14,480 --> 00:05:16,640
because science doesn't work like that.

93
00:05:17,200 --> 00:05:20,240
But it seems it's perfectly okay to draw the opposite conclusion.

94
00:05:20,240 --> 00:05:27,200
When I started in medicine, the rate of autism among children in the United States

95
00:05:27,200 --> 00:05:29,120
was about one in ten thousand.

96
00:05:29,680 --> 00:05:32,800
And now the rate of autism is one in a hundred.

97
00:05:33,760 --> 00:05:37,200
Now, there is no way that could be a genetic problem.

98
00:05:37,200 --> 00:05:40,080
So it has to be an environmental problem.

99
00:05:40,080 --> 00:05:48,400
So the issue is what has happened over the last 25 to 30 years to cause this epidemic of autism.

100
00:05:48,400 --> 00:05:53,280
And so the only thing that really has changed is the number of vaccines that are giving,

101
00:05:53,280 --> 00:05:56,960
that are being recommended and are being given to children.

102
00:05:56,960 --> 00:06:02,080
Yes, the only thing that's changed in 25 years is the increased use of vaccines.

103
00:06:02,080 --> 00:06:04,480
No wonder people always tell me I'm living in the past.

104
00:06:05,120 --> 00:06:10,320
Look, Nancy, I know you're a doctor, but you really suck at analyzing cause and effect.

105
00:06:10,320 --> 00:06:15,360
There are thousands of environmental factors that have changed over the last 25 years

106
00:06:15,360 --> 00:06:18,240
and any one or more of them could be causing autism.

107
00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:22,320
And similarly, anecdotal evidence means diddly squat.

108
00:06:22,320 --> 00:06:24,000
I had a chance to interview parents.

109
00:06:24,640 --> 00:06:27,120
Every single parent said the same thing.

110
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:31,680
I had a normal developing child until the day of the vaccine.

111
00:06:31,680 --> 00:06:34,400
We sat down with one local family who shared their story

112
00:06:34,400 --> 00:06:38,240
on how they believe their two children developed autism after they were vaccinated.

113
00:06:38,240 --> 00:06:40,640
I want you to see what these parents are going through with these kids.

114
00:06:48,640 --> 00:06:52,960
Now, we're dealing with people in distress here whose children are suffering horribly.

115
00:06:52,960 --> 00:06:57,440
And I have to show some compassion and tread rather delicately through this subject.

116
00:06:57,440 --> 00:07:01,040
But I'm not going to because I think a lot of parents are selfish blockheads

117
00:07:01,040 --> 00:07:05,200
who are not only putting their children at risk, but other children as well.

118
00:07:05,200 --> 00:07:08,720
Of course, I'm very sorry for the suffering their children are going through.

119
00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:11,760
But that's no excuse for spreading ignorance through the media.

120
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:16,960
Using pictures of suffering children to push a tenuous scientific case

121
00:07:16,960 --> 00:07:21,280
is an old tactic beloved of activists, the media and politicians.

122
00:07:21,280 --> 00:07:24,800
If they don't have any evidence, just show us a picture of a suffering child

123
00:07:24,800 --> 00:07:27,200
and play on our misplaced feelings of guilt.

124
00:07:27,840 --> 00:07:32,000
A number of studies have been done into the alleged link between vaccinations and autism.

125
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:35,360
And like the Danish study, they all come up empty.

126
00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:39,440
The only link is circumstantial, which is that the vaccination shots

127
00:07:39,440 --> 00:07:43,680
are given at about the same time autism diagnosis becomes possible.

128
00:07:43,680 --> 00:07:45,680
This is where cause and effect come in.

129
00:07:45,680 --> 00:07:46,880
It's rather like saying,

130
00:07:46,880 --> 00:07:50,240
my daughter received the cervical cancer vaccine when she was 12

131
00:07:50,240 --> 00:07:53,040
and soon hair was sprouting under her armpits.

132
00:07:53,040 --> 00:07:55,760
My son was given a tetanus shot when he was 13

133
00:07:55,760 --> 00:07:59,520
and it caused him to be moody, sullen and made a mess of his bedsheets.

134
00:07:59,520 --> 00:08:04,320
There's no reason to suppose that autism was brought on at the time it was diagnosed.

135
00:08:05,040 --> 00:08:09,280
According to this study in the International Journal of Developmental Neuroscience,

136
00:08:09,280 --> 00:08:13,120
many lines of evidence suggest that the underlying alterations in the brain

137
00:08:13,120 --> 00:08:16,560
occur long before the period when symptoms become obvious.

138
00:08:16,560 --> 00:08:19,680
Studies of the behaviour of children in the first year of life

139
00:08:19,680 --> 00:08:24,000
demonstrate that symptoms are often detectable in the first six months.

140
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:27,360
The environmental factors known to increase the risk of autism

141
00:08:27,360 --> 00:08:30,720
have critical periods of action during embryogenesis.

142
00:08:30,720 --> 00:08:34,560
In other words, just because a child might be diagnosed at three years old

143
00:08:34,560 --> 00:08:36,880
doesn't mean he suddenly caught autism.

144
00:08:36,880 --> 00:08:40,080
The evidence suggests autism might have developed in the womb

145
00:08:40,080 --> 00:08:42,480
and it's just not diagnosed until three years.

146
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:47,280
There's no doubt there is a risk associated with vaccinations.

147
00:08:47,280 --> 00:08:52,160
About one in a hundred thousand children will get a severe allergic reaction because of it

148
00:08:52,160 --> 00:08:54,080
and there are other side effects.

149
00:08:54,080 --> 00:08:56,480
But we take these risks because we know

150
00:08:56,480 --> 00:09:00,080
that the risk associated with not giving the vaccine is worse.

151
00:09:00,720 --> 00:09:05,520
Children do die from measles, mumps and rubella, even in developed countries.

152
00:09:05,520 --> 00:09:09,680
And in developing countries, measles alone is one of the biggest childhood killers.

153
00:09:10,240 --> 00:09:15,680
In the year 2000, nearly three quarters of a million children died from contracting measles.

154
00:09:15,680 --> 00:09:18,800
And yes, here we can use pictures of suffering children

155
00:09:18,800 --> 00:09:21,440
to illustrate just how bad these viruses are

156
00:09:21,440 --> 00:09:24,480
because the science of vaccination isn't tenuous.

157
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:26,480
It's backed by overwhelming evidence.

158
00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:32,320
An effective measles vaccine was introduced into the United States in 1963.

159
00:09:32,320 --> 00:09:36,160
By 2000, endemic measles had been eradicated in the US.

160
00:09:36,720 --> 00:09:40,880
And when a United Nations vaccination program got underway worldwide,

161
00:09:40,880 --> 00:09:49,440
measles deaths plunged 75% from three quarters of a million in 2000 to 164,000 in 2008.

162
00:09:50,080 --> 00:09:54,720
Mumps also saw a dramatic decline when the MMR vaccine was introduced.

163
00:09:54,720 --> 00:09:58,240
And this is what happened to cases of rubella in the United States

164
00:09:58,240 --> 00:10:00,800
when a vaccine was introduced in 1969.

165
00:10:01,760 --> 00:10:06,800
MMR vaccines have been so successful that a few years ago the World Health Organization

166
00:10:06,800 --> 00:10:10,880
thought it was on track to eradicate all three diseases globally,

167
00:10:10,880 --> 00:10:14,560
just as a worldwide vaccination program had eradicated smallpox.

168
00:10:15,280 --> 00:10:17,920
But then came the scare campaign.

169
00:10:18,720 --> 00:10:23,200
It began soon after the publication of this paper in The Lancet in 1998.

170
00:10:23,760 --> 00:10:28,560
It's actually not a very significant paper, and it doesn't make any extraordinary claims.

171
00:10:29,120 --> 00:10:33,920
Andrew Wakefield did a study of just 12 children and concluded that it's possible

172
00:10:33,920 --> 00:10:38,880
there might be a connection between the MMR vaccine and the autism these kids developed.

173
00:10:39,520 --> 00:10:40,400
Why so?

174
00:10:40,400 --> 00:10:44,560
Well, he suggested that maybe measles virus was retained in the gut,

175
00:10:44,560 --> 00:10:48,080
where it may have caused an infection that might have led to autism.

176
00:10:48,800 --> 00:10:53,280
But it had absolutely no physical or statistical evidence to support it.

177
00:10:53,280 --> 00:10:57,520
It was certainly interesting, but no one who read this paper could have concluded

178
00:10:57,520 --> 00:11:00,560
that there was any link between autism and vaccinations.

179
00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:04,640
Except, of course, people who were against these vaccinations

180
00:11:04,640 --> 00:11:06,720
and fed that line to journalists.

181
00:11:06,720 --> 00:11:10,880
Vaccine-induced autism is very controversial in the medical community.

182
00:11:10,880 --> 00:11:17,440
A study done by doctors and researchers in England in 1998 and more recently in 2006

183
00:11:17,440 --> 00:11:22,080
suggested that there is a link between the measles, mumps, rubella vaccine and autism.

184
00:11:22,080 --> 00:11:26,320
The study suggests that the preservatives and ingredients in the vaccines could be

185
00:11:26,320 --> 00:11:29,920
causing autism in a significant number of children.

186
00:11:29,920 --> 00:11:33,200
But the quotes shown here don't come from Wakefield's paper.

187
00:11:33,760 --> 00:11:37,920
So who did this reporter get to interpret the Wakefield paper for him?

188
00:11:38,720 --> 00:11:43,360
It was a leading advocate for the link between vaccines and autism, David Thrower.

189
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:48,400
Eight years after Wakefield's study was published, an American doctor, Stephen Walker,

190
00:11:48,400 --> 00:11:52,000
also claimed a possible link between MMR and autism,

191
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:54,640
this time in nothing more than a poster presentation

192
00:11:54,640 --> 00:11:56,880
at the International Meeting for Autism Research.

193
00:11:57,680 --> 00:12:01,360
But that didn't stop the media making outrageous claims for it,

194
00:12:01,360 --> 00:12:06,400
not only hyping the results, but also the status of the study and the support it had.

195
00:12:06,960 --> 00:12:11,600
By this time there was more than enough evidence gathered over the years to convince researchers

196
00:12:11,600 --> 00:12:14,880
there was no link between vaccinations and autism,

197
00:12:14,880 --> 00:12:19,520
but these well-documented studies were ignored in favour of the snappy headline.

198
00:12:20,160 --> 00:12:21,840
Now where have we heard that before?

199
00:12:23,120 --> 00:12:26,960
I'm going to look at the role of the media in this story more closely when I do a future

200
00:12:26,960 --> 00:12:32,160
video in my Science and the Media series because the vaccination issue is one where they royally

201
00:12:32,160 --> 00:12:36,720
stuffed up, not just by failing to research or report accurately,

202
00:12:36,720 --> 00:12:42,400
but by seeing science, like politics, as a subject that has to have two sides.

203
00:12:42,400 --> 00:12:47,600
Bending over backwards and moving the goalposts to give a belief without evidence equal weight

204
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:53,040
to scientific studies backed by overwhelming evidence is not balance, it's bias.

205
00:12:53,600 --> 00:12:56,960
In no way are we saying that you should not have your children vaccinated,

206
00:12:56,960 --> 00:13:01,120
we just want to provide you the information you need to know to make an informed choice.

207
00:13:01,120 --> 00:13:04,480
Yes, We Report, You Decide has a nice ring to it,

208
00:13:04,480 --> 00:13:08,240
but if the report is crap, then the decision based on it will be crap.

209
00:13:08,960 --> 00:13:13,520
And encouraging people to read the research for themselves may sound balanced,

210
00:13:13,520 --> 00:13:16,320
but let's face it, they won't read the research,

211
00:13:16,320 --> 00:13:21,920
they'll just Google a few words and read and believe whatever crappy websites pop up first.

212
00:13:22,640 --> 00:13:26,640
No wonder that in the wake of this internet campaign and the media hype,

213
00:13:26,640 --> 00:13:31,520
so many parents stopped vaccinating their children in the first decade of the 21st century.

214
00:13:32,080 --> 00:13:36,480
That wasn't reversed even after it was found that Wakefield had faked his results

215
00:13:36,480 --> 00:13:38,800
and his meagre research was discredited.

216
00:13:39,440 --> 00:13:43,520
Once the internet has been surfed and the conspiracy belief is planted,

217
00:13:43,520 --> 00:13:45,680
nothing, it seems, can change it.

218
00:13:45,680 --> 00:13:50,400
The result? Having become diseases of the past in most developed countries,

219
00:13:50,400 --> 00:13:55,200
by 2004, mumps was back, and soon after, so was measles.

220
00:13:55,760 --> 00:13:59,360
The Daily Mail, fearless when it came to telling parents five years earlier

221
00:13:59,360 --> 00:14:03,040
that the MMR vaccine might be dangerous for their children,

222
00:14:03,040 --> 00:14:07,200
now had to ask the inevitable question, why is measles on the rise?

223
00:14:08,080 --> 00:14:11,120
And the inevitable answer? Just blame the French.

224
00:14:12,320 --> 00:14:14,720
Actually, the real answer came in the story.

225
00:14:14,720 --> 00:14:18,320
A lot of British parents had stopped having their kids vaccinated,

226
00:14:18,320 --> 00:14:23,200
so when they went on holiday to France, where parents were also not vaccinating their kids,

227
00:14:23,200 --> 00:14:26,400
they were exposed to the virus and the children caught it.

228
00:14:26,400 --> 00:14:30,960
And when these British children got home, they spread it among their unvaccinated friends.

229
00:14:31,760 --> 00:14:34,960
Soon I'm sure we'll see enraged Daily Mail editorials

230
00:14:34,960 --> 00:14:39,360
asking why British parents haven't been vaccinating their kids for the past five years.

231
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:41,440
Well, here's why.

232
00:14:42,960 --> 00:14:46,240
If more and more children stop getting MMR vaccines,

233
00:14:46,240 --> 00:14:49,920
cases of measles, mumps and rubella will soar, simple as that.

234
00:14:50,640 --> 00:14:56,000
Worst of all, we've come so close to eradicating all three diseases worldwide,

235
00:14:56,000 --> 00:15:01,120
and now we're deliberately and methodically taking the first steps backwards.
