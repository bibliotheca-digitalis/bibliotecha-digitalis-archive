00:00.000 --> 00:02.080
Up to now I've had eight heart attacks.

00:02.080 --> 00:04.400
I've had colitis for four years.

00:04.400 --> 00:06.880
I have had edema for about 20 years.

00:06.880 --> 00:09.520
I was diagnosed with diabetes nine months ago.

00:09.520 --> 00:10.720
Well yeah, I thought I was going to die.

00:10.720 --> 00:13.120
Okay, there's a catalogue of ailments here.

00:13.120 --> 00:14.480
Can they be cured?

00:14.480 --> 00:15.840
Maybe a change of mood music?

00:16.480 --> 00:18.000
160 pounds.

00:18.000 --> 00:20.960
I've seen a 50% at least reduction.

00:20.960 --> 00:26.560
I first noticed my edema going away about four days into this movie.

00:26.560 --> 00:29.200
I thought, you know, just never gonna reverse.

00:29.200 --> 00:32.320
Well here it is six months later and I don't have cancer anymore.

00:32.320 --> 00:34.800
What? Don't have cancer anymore?

00:35.440 --> 00:37.760
Well it can't be the mood music that did it.

00:37.760 --> 00:40.640
So what has cured all of these people of their ailments?

00:40.640 --> 00:44.800
And the raw food drew and pulled excess mucus out of them.

00:44.800 --> 00:47.280
That's right, eating raw vegetables and fruit.

00:47.840 --> 00:51.600
Now I don't want to dismiss the idea that eating fruit and veg is good for you.

00:51.600 --> 00:53.920
Just about every doctor will tell you this.

00:53.920 --> 00:57.760
And we're all aware that a diet rich in the sort of things you find in processed food

00:57.760 --> 01:03.600
like sugar, salt and fat can cause everything from diabetes to arterial sclerosis.

01:03.600 --> 01:07.760
So changing to a fruit and veg diet certainly helps alleviate these problems.

01:08.480 --> 01:11.440
But the author of this video goes much further.

01:11.440 --> 01:17.600
Documenting 37 cases of a fruit and veg diet curing everything from psoriasis to cancer.

01:18.160 --> 01:19.440
And further still.

01:19.440 --> 01:25.040
It is as natural for a human to be healthy as it is for water to flow downward.

01:26.000 --> 01:30.080
Being unwell is about as unnatural as for water to flow backwards.

01:31.280 --> 01:33.360
So who's making such ridiculous claims?

01:34.720 --> 01:40.320
Sorry, this is Valia Butenko and her belief that sickness and disease simply wouldn't happen

01:40.320 --> 01:43.120
if only we ate nothing but raw vegetables and fruit.

01:43.680 --> 01:45.520
Look, see, she can run uphill.

01:45.520 --> 01:48.560
Is promoted in a website I've come across before.

01:48.560 --> 01:49.520
Natural news.

01:50.240 --> 01:54.960
Without, apparently, bothering to check any of the testimonials presented in her video,

01:54.960 --> 01:58.480
natural news stated that they were documented and true.

01:59.280 --> 02:03.440
But then natural news has form when it comes to spreading junk science

02:03.440 --> 02:06.880
and theories that scientists are conspiring to harm us all.

02:06.880 --> 02:08.560
Here's one that catches the eye.

02:09.120 --> 02:09.760
Exposed!

02:09.760 --> 02:14.000
The Centre for Disease Control deliberately manipulated, covered up scientific data,

02:14.000 --> 02:17.040
showing link between vaccines containing mercury and autism.

02:18.320 --> 02:21.840
Now this has been in the news over the last few years, so the discovery that one of the

02:21.840 --> 02:27.360
institutions at the heart of promoting vaccines has been covering up a link between the vaccines

02:27.360 --> 02:30.880
and autism is, well, news breaking stuff.

02:31.520 --> 02:35.120
So why haven't I seen it anywhere except natural news?

02:36.000 --> 02:39.760
Well, as usual, if we want to check a fact, what do we do?

02:39.760 --> 02:41.040
Find out where it comes from.

02:42.160 --> 02:43.120
That's right.

02:43.120 --> 02:45.520
So let's check where this claim comes from.

02:45.520 --> 02:46.400
What's the source?

02:47.040 --> 02:49.920
Apparently the information comes from an organisation called

02:49.920 --> 02:53.440
the Coalition for Mercury-Free Drugs, COMED.

02:53.440 --> 02:56.240
They obtained a copy of an email from the CDC

02:56.240 --> 03:00.240
discussing a Danish study that was to be published in the journal Pediatrics.

03:00.960 --> 03:03.680
The Danish study looked at the prevalence of autism following

03:03.680 --> 03:07.840
the withdrawal of a preservative called thimerosal in 1992.

03:07.840 --> 03:10.960
If this mercury compound really did cause autism,

03:10.960 --> 03:14.800
we ought to see a drop in the number of cases after it was withdrawn, right?

03:15.600 --> 03:17.360
And according to COMED, we do.

03:18.160 --> 03:21.040
Documents obtained via the Freedom of Information Act

03:21.040 --> 03:24.080
show that CDC officials were aware of Danish data

03:24.080 --> 03:29.280
indicating a connection between removing thimerosal and a decline in autism rates.

03:29.280 --> 03:32.560
Despite this knowledge, these officials allowed a 2003 article

03:32.560 --> 03:36.240
to be published in Pediatrics that excluded this information.

03:37.120 --> 03:40.400
Before we go on, what is this information that's been excluded?

03:41.040 --> 03:46.800
Well, it was the latest figures for autism rates in Denmark at that time, covering 2001.

03:46.880 --> 03:51.600
And according to the email, these show a continuation of the decline in autism rates.

03:51.600 --> 03:56.400
So according to COMED, autism rates dropped after the vaccine was withdrawn

03:56.400 --> 04:00.160
and figures showing that this drop continued were deliberately excluded.

04:00.720 --> 04:03.680
This would seem to be slam dunk evidence of a conspiracy

04:03.680 --> 04:05.840
of government and science of the highest order.

04:06.560 --> 04:10.000
Ah, until you look at the figures COMED is talking about.

04:11.200 --> 04:14.000
Remember how it said rates of autism dropped in Denmark

04:14.000 --> 04:16.720
when the vaccine was withdrawn in 1992?

04:16.720 --> 04:19.760
Well, guess what? Turns out they did the opposite.

04:19.760 --> 04:20.480
They rose.

04:21.600 --> 04:24.000
And remember that decline that was talked about?

04:24.000 --> 04:30.560
Well, that didn't happen until around 1999, seven years after the vaccine was withdrawn.

04:30.560 --> 04:34.080
And the 2001 figure that was simply a continuation of the decline?

04:34.080 --> 04:37.360
Well, that was nine years after the vaccine was withdrawn

04:37.360 --> 04:39.520
and therefore hardly relevant to the study.

04:40.240 --> 04:42.480
Leaving it out didn't change the picture at all.

04:43.200 --> 04:48.080
Now, the folks at COMED weren't suggesting that the figures prior to 2001 had been manipulated.

04:48.080 --> 04:52.800
They simply didn't tell us there was a seven year gap between the withdrawal of a vaccine

04:52.800 --> 04:55.920
and the supposedly linked decline in autism.

04:55.920 --> 04:59.520
In fact, if one looks at the graph through the eyes of a witless person,

04:59.520 --> 05:02.400
one who understands very little about cause and effect,

05:02.400 --> 05:06.080
one could more readily conclude that thimerosal prevents autism

05:06.080 --> 05:09.200
because as soon as it's withdrawn, autism rates soar.

05:10.080 --> 05:14.480
But of course, no researcher would make such a sweeping and unsubstantiated inference

05:14.480 --> 05:16.640
because science doesn't work like that.

05:17.200 --> 05:20.240
But it seems it's perfectly okay to draw the opposite conclusion.

05:20.240 --> 05:27.200
When I started in medicine, the rate of autism among children in the United States

05:27.200 --> 05:29.120
was about one in ten thousand.

05:29.680 --> 05:32.800
And now the rate of autism is one in a hundred.

05:33.760 --> 05:37.200
Now, there is no way that could be a genetic problem.

05:37.200 --> 05:40.080
So it has to be an environmental problem.

05:40.080 --> 05:48.400
So the issue is what has happened over the last 25 to 30 years to cause this epidemic of autism.

05:48.400 --> 05:53.280
And so the only thing that really has changed is the number of vaccines that are giving,

05:53.280 --> 05:56.960
that are being recommended and are being given to children.

05:56.960 --> 06:02.080
Yes, the only thing that's changed in 25 years is the increased use of vaccines.

06:02.080 --> 06:04.480
No wonder people always tell me I'm living in the past.

06:05.120 --> 06:10.320
Look, Nancy, I know you're a doctor, but you really suck at analyzing cause and effect.

06:10.320 --> 06:15.360
There are thousands of environmental factors that have changed over the last 25 years

06:15.360 --> 06:18.240
and any one or more of them could be causing autism.

06:18.800 --> 06:22.320
And similarly, anecdotal evidence means diddly squat.

06:22.320 --> 06:24.000
I had a chance to interview parents.

06:24.640 --> 06:27.120
Every single parent said the same thing.

06:27.120 --> 06:31.680
I had a normal developing child until the day of the vaccine.

06:31.680 --> 06:34.400
We sat down with one local family who shared their story

06:34.400 --> 06:38.240
on how they believe their two children developed autism after they were vaccinated.

06:38.240 --> 06:40.640
I want you to see what these parents are going through with these kids.

06:48.640 --> 06:52.960
Now, we're dealing with people in distress here whose children are suffering horribly.

06:52.960 --> 06:57.440
And I have to show some compassion and tread rather delicately through this subject.

06:57.440 --> 07:01.040
But I'm not going to because I think a lot of parents are selfish blockheads

07:01.040 --> 07:05.200
who are not only putting their children at risk, but other children as well.

07:05.200 --> 07:08.720
Of course, I'm very sorry for the suffering their children are going through.

07:08.720 --> 07:11.760
But that's no excuse for spreading ignorance through the media.

07:12.800 --> 07:16.960
Using pictures of suffering children to push a tenuous scientific case

07:16.960 --> 07:21.280
is an old tactic beloved of activists, the media and politicians.

07:21.280 --> 07:24.800
If they don't have any evidence, just show us a picture of a suffering child

07:24.800 --> 07:27.200
and play on our misplaced feelings of guilt.

07:27.840 --> 07:32.000
A number of studies have been done into the alleged link between vaccinations and autism.

07:32.000 --> 07:35.360
And like the Danish study, they all come up empty.

07:35.360 --> 07:39.440
The only link is circumstantial, which is that the vaccination shots

07:39.440 --> 07:43.680
are given at about the same time autism diagnosis becomes possible.

07:43.680 --> 07:45.680
This is where cause and effect come in.

07:45.680 --> 07:46.880
It's rather like saying,

07:46.880 --> 07:50.240
my daughter received the cervical cancer vaccine when she was 12

07:50.240 --> 07:53.040
and soon hair was sprouting under her armpits.

07:53.040 --> 07:55.760
My son was given a tetanus shot when he was 13

07:55.760 --> 07:59.520
and it caused him to be moody, sullen and made a mess of his bedsheets.

07:59.520 --> 08:04.320
There's no reason to suppose that autism was brought on at the time it was diagnosed.

08:05.040 --> 08:09.280
According to this study in the International Journal of Developmental Neuroscience,

08:09.280 --> 08:13.120
many lines of evidence suggest that the underlying alterations in the brain

08:13.120 --> 08:16.560
occur long before the period when symptoms become obvious.

08:16.560 --> 08:19.680
Studies of the behaviour of children in the first year of life

08:19.680 --> 08:24.000
demonstrate that symptoms are often detectable in the first six months.

08:24.000 --> 08:27.360
The environmental factors known to increase the risk of autism

08:27.360 --> 08:30.720
have critical periods of action during embryogenesis.

08:30.720 --> 08:34.560
In other words, just because a child might be diagnosed at three years old

08:34.560 --> 08:36.880
doesn't mean he suddenly caught autism.

08:36.880 --> 08:40.080
The evidence suggests autism might have developed in the womb

08:40.080 --> 08:42.480
and it's just not diagnosed until three years.

08:43.440 --> 08:47.280
There's no doubt there is a risk associated with vaccinations.

08:47.280 --> 08:52.160
About one in a hundred thousand children will get a severe allergic reaction because of it

08:52.160 --> 08:54.080
and there are other side effects.

08:54.080 --> 08:56.480
But we take these risks because we know

08:56.480 --> 09:00.080
that the risk associated with not giving the vaccine is worse.

09:00.720 --> 09:05.520
Children do die from measles, mumps and rubella, even in developed countries.

09:05.520 --> 09:09.680
And in developing countries, measles alone is one of the biggest childhood killers.

09:10.240 --> 09:15.680
In the year 2000, nearly three quarters of a million children died from contracting measles.

09:15.680 --> 09:18.800
And yes, here we can use pictures of suffering children

09:18.800 --> 09:21.440
to illustrate just how bad these viruses are

09:21.440 --> 09:24.480
because the science of vaccination isn't tenuous.

09:24.480 --> 09:26.480
It's backed by overwhelming evidence.

09:27.360 --> 09:32.320
An effective measles vaccine was introduced into the United States in 1963.

09:32.320 --> 09:36.160
By 2000, endemic measles had been eradicated in the US.

09:36.720 --> 09:40.880
And when a United Nations vaccination program got underway worldwide,

09:40.880 --> 09:49.440
measles deaths plunged 75% from three quarters of a million in 2000 to 164,000 in 2008.

09:50.080 --> 09:54.720
Mumps also saw a dramatic decline when the MMR vaccine was introduced.

09:54.720 --> 09:58.240
And this is what happened to cases of rubella in the United States

09:58.240 --> 10:00.800
when a vaccine was introduced in 1969.

10:01.760 --> 10:06.800
MMR vaccines have been so successful that a few years ago the World Health Organization

10:06.800 --> 10:10.880
thought it was on track to eradicate all three diseases globally,

10:10.880 --> 10:14.560
just as a worldwide vaccination program had eradicated smallpox.

10:15.280 --> 10:17.920
But then came the scare campaign.

10:18.720 --> 10:23.200
It began soon after the publication of this paper in The Lancet in 1998.

10:23.760 --> 10:28.560
It's actually not a very significant paper, and it doesn't make any extraordinary claims.

10:29.120 --> 10:33.920
Andrew Wakefield did a study of just 12 children and concluded that it's possible

10:33.920 --> 10:38.880
there might be a connection between the MMR vaccine and the autism these kids developed.

10:39.520 --> 10:40.400
Why so?

10:40.400 --> 10:44.560
Well, he suggested that maybe measles virus was retained in the gut,

10:44.560 --> 10:48.080
where it may have caused an infection that might have led to autism.

10:48.800 --> 10:53.280
But it had absolutely no physical or statistical evidence to support it.

10:53.280 --> 10:57.520
It was certainly interesting, but no one who read this paper could have concluded

10:57.520 --> 11:00.560
that there was any link between autism and vaccinations.

11:01.200 --> 11:04.640
Except, of course, people who were against these vaccinations

11:04.640 --> 11:06.720
and fed that line to journalists.

11:06.720 --> 11:10.880
Vaccine-induced autism is very controversial in the medical community.

11:10.880 --> 11:17.440
A study done by doctors and researchers in England in 1998 and more recently in 2006

11:17.440 --> 11:22.080
suggested that there is a link between the measles, mumps, rubella vaccine and autism.

11:22.080 --> 11:26.320
The study suggests that the preservatives and ingredients in the vaccines could be

11:26.320 --> 11:29.920
causing autism in a significant number of children.

11:29.920 --> 11:33.200
But the quotes shown here don't come from Wakefield's paper.

11:33.760 --> 11:37.920
So who did this reporter get to interpret the Wakefield paper for him?

11:38.720 --> 11:43.360
It was a leading advocate for the link between vaccines and autism, David Thrower.

11:44.000 --> 11:48.400
Eight years after Wakefield's study was published, an American doctor, Stephen Walker,

11:48.400 --> 11:52.000
also claimed a possible link between MMR and autism,

11:52.000 --> 11:54.640
this time in nothing more than a poster presentation

11:54.640 --> 11:56.880
at the International Meeting for Autism Research.

11:57.680 --> 12:01.360
But that didn't stop the media making outrageous claims for it,

12:01.360 --> 12:06.400
not only hyping the results, but also the status of the study and the support it had.

12:06.960 --> 12:11.600
By this time there was more than enough evidence gathered over the years to convince researchers

12:11.600 --> 12:14.880
there was no link between vaccinations and autism,

12:14.880 --> 12:19.520
but these well-documented studies were ignored in favour of the snappy headline.

12:20.160 --> 12:21.840
Now where have we heard that before?

12:23.120 --> 12:26.960
I'm going to look at the role of the media in this story more closely when I do a future

12:26.960 --> 12:32.160
video in my Science and the Media series because the vaccination issue is one where they royally

12:32.160 --> 12:36.720
stuffed up, not just by failing to research or report accurately,

12:36.720 --> 12:42.400
but by seeing science, like politics, as a subject that has to have two sides.

12:42.400 --> 12:47.600
Bending over backwards and moving the goalposts to give a belief without evidence equal weight

12:47.600 --> 12:53.040
to scientific studies backed by overwhelming evidence is not balance, it's bias.

12:53.600 --> 12:56.960
In no way are we saying that you should not have your children vaccinated,

12:56.960 --> 13:01.120
we just want to provide you the information you need to know to make an informed choice.

13:01.120 --> 13:04.480
Yes, We Report, You Decide has a nice ring to it,

13:04.480 --> 13:08.240
but if the report is crap, then the decision based on it will be crap.

13:08.960 --> 13:13.520
And encouraging people to read the research for themselves may sound balanced,

13:13.520 --> 13:16.320
but let's face it, they won't read the research,

13:16.320 --> 13:21.920
they'll just Google a few words and read and believe whatever crappy websites pop up first.

13:22.640 --> 13:26.640
No wonder that in the wake of this internet campaign and the media hype,

13:26.640 --> 13:31.520
so many parents stopped vaccinating their children in the first decade of the 21st century.

13:32.080 --> 13:36.480
That wasn't reversed even after it was found that Wakefield had faked his results

13:36.480 --> 13:38.800
and his meagre research was discredited.

13:39.440 --> 13:43.520
Once the internet has been surfed and the conspiracy belief is planted,

13:43.520 --> 13:45.680
nothing, it seems, can change it.

13:45.680 --> 13:50.400
The result? Having become diseases of the past in most developed countries,

13:50.400 --> 13:55.200
by 2004, mumps was back, and soon after, so was measles.

13:55.760 --> 13:59.360
The Daily Mail, fearless when it came to telling parents five years earlier

13:59.360 --> 14:03.040
that the MMR vaccine might be dangerous for their children,

14:03.040 --> 14:07.200
now had to ask the inevitable question, why is measles on the rise?

14:08.080 --> 14:11.120
And the inevitable answer? Just blame the French.

14:12.320 --> 14:14.720
Actually, the real answer came in the story.

14:14.720 --> 14:18.320
A lot of British parents had stopped having their kids vaccinated,

14:18.320 --> 14:23.200
so when they went on holiday to France, where parents were also not vaccinating their kids,

14:23.200 --> 14:26.400
they were exposed to the virus and the children caught it.

14:26.400 --> 14:30.960
And when these British children got home, they spread it among their unvaccinated friends.

14:31.760 --> 14:34.960
Soon I'm sure we'll see enraged Daily Mail editorials

14:34.960 --> 14:39.360
asking why British parents haven't been vaccinating their kids for the past five years.

14:40.000 --> 14:41.440
Well, here's why.

14:42.960 --> 14:46.240
If more and more children stop getting MMR vaccines,

14:46.240 --> 14:49.920
cases of measles, mumps and rubella will soar, simple as that.

14:50.640 --> 14:56.000
Worst of all, we've come so close to eradicating all three diseases worldwide,

14:56.000 --> 15:01.120
and now we're deliberately and methodically taking the first steps backwards.
