0	2080	Up to now I've had eight heart attacks.
2080	4400	I've had colitis for four years.
4400	6880	I have had edema for about 20 years.
6880	9520	I was diagnosed with diabetes nine months ago.
9520	10720	Well yeah, I thought I was going to die.
10720	13120	Okay, there's a catalogue of ailments here.
13120	14480	Can they be cured?
14480	15840	Maybe a change of mood music?
16480	18000	160 pounds.
18000	20960	I've seen a 50% at least reduction.
20960	26560	I first noticed my edema going away about four days into this movie.
26560	29200	I thought, you know, just never gonna reverse.
29200	32320	Well here it is six months later and I don't have cancer anymore.
32320	34800	What? Don't have cancer anymore?
35440	37760	Well it can't be the mood music that did it.
37760	40640	So what has cured all of these people of their ailments?
40640	44800	And the raw food drew and pulled excess mucus out of them.
44800	47280	That's right, eating raw vegetables and fruit.
47840	51600	Now I don't want to dismiss the idea that eating fruit and veg is good for you.
51600	53920	Just about every doctor will tell you this.
53920	57760	And we're all aware that a diet rich in the sort of things you find in processed food
57760	63600	like sugar, salt and fat can cause everything from diabetes to arterial sclerosis.
63600	67760	So changing to a fruit and veg diet certainly helps alleviate these problems.
68480	71440	But the author of this video goes much further.
71440	77600	Documenting 37 cases of a fruit and veg diet curing everything from psoriasis to cancer.
78160	79440	And further still.
79440	85040	It is as natural for a human to be healthy as it is for water to flow downward.
86000	90080	Being unwell is about as unnatural as for water to flow backwards.
91280	93360	So who's making such ridiculous claims?
94720	100320	Sorry, this is Valia Butenko and her belief that sickness and disease simply wouldn't happen
100320	103120	if only we ate nothing but raw vegetables and fruit.
103680	105520	Look, see, she can run uphill.
105520	108560	Is promoted in a website I've come across before.
108560	109520	Natural news.
110240	114960	Without, apparently, bothering to check any of the testimonials presented in her video,
114960	118480	natural news stated that they were documented and true.
119280	123440	But then natural news has form when it comes to spreading junk science
123440	126880	and theories that scientists are conspiring to harm us all.
126880	128560	Here's one that catches the eye.
129120	129760	Exposed!
129760	134000	The Centre for Disease Control deliberately manipulated, covered up scientific data,
134000	137040	showing link between vaccines containing mercury and autism.
138320	141840	Now this has been in the news over the last few years, so the discovery that one of the
141840	147360	institutions at the heart of promoting vaccines has been covering up a link between the vaccines
147360	150880	and autism is, well, news breaking stuff.
151520	155120	So why haven't I seen it anywhere except natural news?
156000	159760	Well, as usual, if we want to check a fact, what do we do?
159760	161040	Find out where it comes from.
162160	163120	That's right.
163120	165520	So let's check where this claim comes from.
165520	166400	What's the source?
167040	169920	Apparently the information comes from an organisation called
169920	173440	the Coalition for Mercury-Free Drugs, COMED.
173440	176240	They obtained a copy of an email from the CDC
176240	180240	discussing a Danish study that was to be published in the journal Pediatrics.
180960	183680	The Danish study looked at the prevalence of autism following
183680	187840	the withdrawal of a preservative called thimerosal in 1992.
187840	190960	If this mercury compound really did cause autism,
190960	194800	we ought to see a drop in the number of cases after it was withdrawn, right?
195600	197360	And according to COMED, we do.
198160	201040	Documents obtained via the Freedom of Information Act
201040	204080	show that CDC officials were aware of Danish data
204080	209280	indicating a connection between removing thimerosal and a decline in autism rates.
209280	212560	Despite this knowledge, these officials allowed a 2003 article
212560	216240	to be published in Pediatrics that excluded this information.
217120	220400	Before we go on, what is this information that's been excluded?
221040	226800	Well, it was the latest figures for autism rates in Denmark at that time, covering 2001.
226880	231600	And according to the email, these show a continuation of the decline in autism rates.
231600	236400	So according to COMED, autism rates dropped after the vaccine was withdrawn
236400	240160	and figures showing that this drop continued were deliberately excluded.
240720	243680	This would seem to be slam dunk evidence of a conspiracy
243680	245840	of government and science of the highest order.
246560	250000	Ah, until you look at the figures COMED is talking about.
251200	254000	Remember how it said rates of autism dropped in Denmark
254000	256720	when the vaccine was withdrawn in 1992?
256720	259760	Well, guess what? Turns out they did the opposite.
259760	260480	They rose.
261600	264000	And remember that decline that was talked about?
264000	270560	Well, that didn't happen until around 1999, seven years after the vaccine was withdrawn.
270560	274080	And the 2001 figure that was simply a continuation of the decline?
274080	277360	Well, that was nine years after the vaccine was withdrawn
277360	279520	and therefore hardly relevant to the study.
280240	282480	Leaving it out didn't change the picture at all.
283200	288080	Now, the folks at COMED weren't suggesting that the figures prior to 2001 had been manipulated.
288080	292800	They simply didn't tell us there was a seven year gap between the withdrawal of a vaccine
292800	295920	and the supposedly linked decline in autism.
295920	299520	In fact, if one looks at the graph through the eyes of a witless person,
299520	302400	one who understands very little about cause and effect,
302400	306080	one could more readily conclude that thimerosal prevents autism
306080	309200	because as soon as it's withdrawn, autism rates soar.
310080	314480	But of course, no researcher would make such a sweeping and unsubstantiated inference
314480	316640	because science doesn't work like that.
317200	320240	But it seems it's perfectly okay to draw the opposite conclusion.
320240	327200	When I started in medicine, the rate of autism among children in the United States
327200	329120	was about one in ten thousand.
329680	332800	And now the rate of autism is one in a hundred.
333760	337200	Now, there is no way that could be a genetic problem.
337200	340080	So it has to be an environmental problem.
340080	348400	So the issue is what has happened over the last 25 to 30 years to cause this epidemic of autism.
348400	353280	And so the only thing that really has changed is the number of vaccines that are giving,
353280	356960	that are being recommended and are being given to children.
356960	362080	Yes, the only thing that's changed in 25 years is the increased use of vaccines.
362080	364480	No wonder people always tell me I'm living in the past.
365120	370320	Look, Nancy, I know you're a doctor, but you really suck at analyzing cause and effect.
370320	375360	There are thousands of environmental factors that have changed over the last 25 years
375360	378240	and any one or more of them could be causing autism.
378800	382320	And similarly, anecdotal evidence means diddly squat.
382320	384000	I had a chance to interview parents.
384640	387120	Every single parent said the same thing.
387120	391680	I had a normal developing child until the day of the vaccine.
391680	394400	We sat down with one local family who shared their story
394400	398240	on how they believe their two children developed autism after they were vaccinated.
398240	400640	I want you to see what these parents are going through with these kids.
408640	412960	Now, we're dealing with people in distress here whose children are suffering horribly.
412960	417440	And I have to show some compassion and tread rather delicately through this subject.
417440	421040	But I'm not going to because I think a lot of parents are selfish blockheads
421040	425200	who are not only putting their children at risk, but other children as well.
425200	428720	Of course, I'm very sorry for the suffering their children are going through.
428720	431760	But that's no excuse for spreading ignorance through the media.
432800	436960	Using pictures of suffering children to push a tenuous scientific case
436960	441280	is an old tactic beloved of activists, the media and politicians.
441280	444800	If they don't have any evidence, just show us a picture of a suffering child
444800	447200	and play on our misplaced feelings of guilt.
447840	452000	A number of studies have been done into the alleged link between vaccinations and autism.
452000	455360	And like the Danish study, they all come up empty.
455360	459440	The only link is circumstantial, which is that the vaccination shots
459440	463680	are given at about the same time autism diagnosis becomes possible.
463680	465680	This is where cause and effect come in.
465680	466880	It's rather like saying,
466880	470240	my daughter received the cervical cancer vaccine when she was 12
470240	473040	and soon hair was sprouting under her armpits.
473040	475760	My son was given a tetanus shot when he was 13
475760	479520	and it caused him to be moody, sullen and made a mess of his bedsheets.
479520	484320	There's no reason to suppose that autism was brought on at the time it was diagnosed.
485040	489280	According to this study in the International Journal of Developmental Neuroscience,
489280	493120	many lines of evidence suggest that the underlying alterations in the brain
493120	496560	occur long before the period when symptoms become obvious.
496560	499680	Studies of the behaviour of children in the first year of life
499680	504000	demonstrate that symptoms are often detectable in the first six months.
504000	507360	The environmental factors known to increase the risk of autism
507360	510720	have critical periods of action during embryogenesis.
510720	514560	In other words, just because a child might be diagnosed at three years old
514560	516880	doesn't mean he suddenly caught autism.
516880	520080	The evidence suggests autism might have developed in the womb
520080	522480	and it's just not diagnosed until three years.
523440	527280	There's no doubt there is a risk associated with vaccinations.
527280	532160	About one in a hundred thousand children will get a severe allergic reaction because of it
532160	534080	and there are other side effects.
534080	536480	But we take these risks because we know
536480	540080	that the risk associated with not giving the vaccine is worse.
540720	545520	Children do die from measles, mumps and rubella, even in developed countries.
545520	549680	And in developing countries, measles alone is one of the biggest childhood killers.
550240	555680	In the year 2000, nearly three quarters of a million children died from contracting measles.
555680	558800	And yes, here we can use pictures of suffering children
558800	561440	to illustrate just how bad these viruses are
561440	564480	because the science of vaccination isn't tenuous.
564480	566480	It's backed by overwhelming evidence.
567360	572320	An effective measles vaccine was introduced into the United States in 1963.
572320	576160	By 2000, endemic measles had been eradicated in the US.
576720	580880	And when a United Nations vaccination program got underway worldwide,
580880	589440	measles deaths plunged 75% from three quarters of a million in 2000 to 164,000 in 2008.
590080	594720	Mumps also saw a dramatic decline when the MMR vaccine was introduced.
594720	598240	And this is what happened to cases of rubella in the United States
598240	600800	when a vaccine was introduced in 1969.
601760	606800	MMR vaccines have been so successful that a few years ago the World Health Organization
606800	610880	thought it was on track to eradicate all three diseases globally,
610880	614560	just as a worldwide vaccination program had eradicated smallpox.
615280	617920	But then came the scare campaign.
618720	623200	It began soon after the publication of this paper in The Lancet in 1998.
623760	628560	It's actually not a very significant paper, and it doesn't make any extraordinary claims.
629120	633920	Andrew Wakefield did a study of just 12 children and concluded that it's possible
633920	638880	there might be a connection between the MMR vaccine and the autism these kids developed.
639520	640400	Why so?
640400	644560	Well, he suggested that maybe measles virus was retained in the gut,
644560	648080	where it may have caused an infection that might have led to autism.
648800	653280	But it had absolutely no physical or statistical evidence to support it.
653280	657520	It was certainly interesting, but no one who read this paper could have concluded
657520	660560	that there was any link between autism and vaccinations.
661200	664640	Except, of course, people who were against these vaccinations
664640	666720	and fed that line to journalists.
666720	670880	Vaccine-induced autism is very controversial in the medical community.
670880	677440	A study done by doctors and researchers in England in 1998 and more recently in 2006
677440	682080	suggested that there is a link between the measles, mumps, rubella vaccine and autism.
682080	686320	The study suggests that the preservatives and ingredients in the vaccines could be
686320	689920	causing autism in a significant number of children.
689920	693200	But the quotes shown here don't come from Wakefield's paper.
693760	697920	So who did this reporter get to interpret the Wakefield paper for him?
698720	703360	It was a leading advocate for the link between vaccines and autism, David Thrower.
704000	708400	Eight years after Wakefield's study was published, an American doctor, Stephen Walker,
708400	712000	also claimed a possible link between MMR and autism,
712000	714640	this time in nothing more than a poster presentation
714640	716880	at the International Meeting for Autism Research.
717680	721360	But that didn't stop the media making outrageous claims for it,
721360	726400	not only hyping the results, but also the status of the study and the support it had.
726960	731600	By this time there was more than enough evidence gathered over the years to convince researchers
731600	734880	there was no link between vaccinations and autism,
734880	739520	but these well-documented studies were ignored in favour of the snappy headline.
740160	741840	Now where have we heard that before?
743120	746960	I'm going to look at the role of the media in this story more closely when I do a future
746960	752160	video in my Science and the Media series because the vaccination issue is one where they royally
752160	756720	stuffed up, not just by failing to research or report accurately,
756720	762400	but by seeing science, like politics, as a subject that has to have two sides.
762400	767600	Bending over backwards and moving the goalposts to give a belief without evidence equal weight
767600	773040	to scientific studies backed by overwhelming evidence is not balance, it's bias.
773600	776960	In no way are we saying that you should not have your children vaccinated,
776960	781120	we just want to provide you the information you need to know to make an informed choice.
781120	784480	Yes, We Report, You Decide has a nice ring to it,
784480	788240	but if the report is crap, then the decision based on it will be crap.
788960	793520	And encouraging people to read the research for themselves may sound balanced,
793520	796320	but let's face it, they won't read the research,
796320	801920	they'll just Google a few words and read and believe whatever crappy websites pop up first.
802640	806640	No wonder that in the wake of this internet campaign and the media hype,
806640	811520	so many parents stopped vaccinating their children in the first decade of the 21st century.
812080	816480	That wasn't reversed even after it was found that Wakefield had faked his results
816480	818800	and his meagre research was discredited.
819440	823520	Once the internet has been surfed and the conspiracy belief is planted,
823520	825680	nothing, it seems, can change it.
825680	830400	The result? Having become diseases of the past in most developed countries,
830400	835200	by 2004, mumps was back, and soon after, so was measles.
835760	839360	The Daily Mail, fearless when it came to telling parents five years earlier
839360	843040	that the MMR vaccine might be dangerous for their children,
843040	847200	now had to ask the inevitable question, why is measles on the rise?
848080	851120	And the inevitable answer? Just blame the French.
852320	854720	Actually, the real answer came in the story.
854720	858320	A lot of British parents had stopped having their kids vaccinated,
858320	863200	so when they went on holiday to France, where parents were also not vaccinating their kids,
863200	866400	they were exposed to the virus and the children caught it.
866400	870960	And when these British children got home, they spread it among their unvaccinated friends.
871760	874960	Soon I'm sure we'll see enraged Daily Mail editorials
874960	879360	asking why British parents haven't been vaccinating their kids for the past five years.
880000	881440	Well, here's why.
882960	886240	If more and more children stop getting MMR vaccines,
886240	889920	cases of measles, mumps and rubella will soar, simple as that.
890640	896000	Worst of all, we've come so close to eradicating all three diseases worldwide,
896000	901120	and now we're deliberately and methodically taking the first steps backwards.
