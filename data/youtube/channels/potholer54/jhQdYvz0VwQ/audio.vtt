00:00.000 --> 00:05.000
now this is the story of the old west and it's a story of a man named

00:05.000 --> 00:10.760
Sylvester and he was a dangerous gunslinger yes this is the pothole of

00:10.760 --> 00:17.360
54 channel just bear with me they were in this bar playing cards and somebody

00:17.360 --> 00:22.040
was cheating and next thing you know they go for their guns the guns are

00:22.040 --> 00:27.760
jerked white gun smoke filled the room Sylvester got hit took a bullet tried to

00:27.760 --> 00:33.520
shoot at him again but he got away he slipped out into the desert he collapsed

00:33.520 --> 00:39.280
his face first into the ground and he's a goner and he starts drying and frying

00:39.280 --> 00:44.400
and mummifying and ends up here at a Hall of Curiosities in Seattle where

00:44.400 --> 00:48.640
visitors gawk at Sylvester's desert dried mummy and take pictures of the

00:48.640 --> 00:53.040
blood-spattered bullet hole that killed him at least that's what Arizona's state

00:53.040 --> 00:58.360
historian Marshall Trimble would have us believe but what does science tell us

00:58.360 --> 01:03.200
well an autopsy of the body revealed it hadn't been mummified by the dry desert

01:03.200 --> 01:07.920
heat at all because it was dripping wet with embalming fluid and scientists who

01:07.920 --> 01:11.880
undertook the autopsy on behalf of the History Channel found that the fluid was

01:11.880 --> 01:16.200
loaded with arsenic a common embalmers chemical used in the late 19th century

01:16.200 --> 01:21.280
and they found the injection points in his legs where the fluid was pumped into

01:21.360 --> 01:25.960
the veins and when they checked the hole in his stomach it wasn't consistent with

01:25.960 --> 01:31.400
a bullet but a drill and the so-called blood spatter around it wasn't blood but

01:31.400 --> 01:37.040
red paint and the autopsy revealed that Sylvester didn't die in a gunfight he

01:37.040 --> 01:42.080
died of tuberculosis so what does Arizona's state historian have to say

01:42.080 --> 01:47.320
now that a scientific analysis has shown that everything he believed was a crock

01:47.320 --> 01:51.160
Sylvester can be anybody we want him to be and I want him to be a gunslinger

01:51.160 --> 01:56.280
that's right he still wants to believe it to some people it doesn't matter what

01:56.280 --> 02:01.080
the evidence is or what the science shows for the truly deluded if we want

02:01.080 --> 02:05.760
the gunslinger story to be true then it's true well it's true for me you see

02:05.760 --> 02:08.720
I believe you mean true for you is different from true for anybody else

02:08.720 --> 02:14.000
it's a mindset a human failing that I've been trying to fathom for years of

02:14.080 --> 02:17.480
course we all know that this kind of delusion is meat and potatoes for

02:17.480 --> 02:21.960
creationists because the eye is so complex here's one asking Richard

02:21.960 --> 02:25.480
Dawkins how evolution could make something as complex as an eye a

02:25.480 --> 02:30.840
question Dawkins was able to answer quite easily you can make a slowly

02:30.840 --> 02:36.600
climbing ramp of improvement from just the very rudiments of vision just say

02:36.600 --> 02:41.180
being able to tell the difference between light and shade nothing more

02:41.180 --> 02:47.140
than that right up to the perfection of a human eye or the eye of a hall I mean

02:47.140 --> 02:51.420
there are flatworms that have just a cup for an eye note no lens not even a pinhole

02:51.420 --> 02:56.020
there are animals like nautilus which is a sort of coiled up squid kind of thing

02:56.020 --> 03:02.260
did you find that convincing I said about the eye well not really now you

03:02.260 --> 03:06.300
might think this guy went on to say he didn't understand the explanation or he

03:06.300 --> 03:10.380
found a flaw in the explanation or he questioned the evidence that supported

03:10.380 --> 03:16.820
it but no none of these so what was the reason he didn't accept it let me tell

03:16.820 --> 03:20.500
you what what happened in my brain at that particular moment in time was that

03:20.500 --> 03:25.140
I was thinking of the book of Genesis and where God says that he made

03:25.140 --> 03:28.940
everything according to its kind okay you're probably not all that surprised

03:28.940 --> 03:34.140
after all he's a creationist but this video isn't about why religious people

03:34.140 --> 03:38.380
delude themselves into disbelieving observable evidence and thinking that

03:38.380 --> 03:42.900
science is all a conspiracy it's about why we still have that affliction even

03:42.900 --> 03:47.300
in a post religious world in Western countries where religion is in decline

03:47.300 --> 03:51.860
people aren't necessarily falling in line with science and rational thinking

03:51.860 --> 03:55.780
instead they're turning to wacky ideas they hear from the internet and

03:55.780 --> 04:00.500
believing as Bill O'Reilly would put it that even though science tells us it's

04:00.500 --> 04:05.420
wrong it's true for them it's as if the need to believe is so ingrained in us

04:05.420 --> 04:10.140
that having dispensed with gods and goddesses we now have to substitute new

04:10.140 --> 04:14.860
beliefs that continue to contradict scientific evidence I don't think

04:14.860 --> 04:18.980
there's a better example of this than the weird and wacky responses I got to

04:18.980 --> 04:24.540
my video expanding earth my ass the video debunked the hilariously stupid

04:24.540 --> 04:29.180
claim of comic book artist Neil Adams that the earth is growing and has

04:29.180 --> 04:33.620
doubled in size over the last 60 million years it's a shame that this video takes

04:34.500 --> 04:39.780
yes I must admit the video did take on a rather mocking tone after all I thought

04:39.780 --> 04:44.100
no one still believes in a flat earth an expanding earth a hollow earth or an

04:44.100 --> 04:48.940
earth made out of sponge cake these are ideas expounded by lone nutcases who

04:48.940 --> 04:52.500
used to sit next to you in a pub and bother you with their conspiracy

04:52.500 --> 05:01.460
theories but I hadn't counted on the power of the internet to bring all these

05:01.460 --> 05:06.020
lone nutcases and their myriad conspiracy theories together into one

05:06.020 --> 05:10.820
virtual room just like Sylvester the gunslinger the physics of the earth can

05:10.820 --> 05:15.540
be whatever they want it to be I watched this video expecting an intelligent

05:15.540 --> 05:19.640
counter-argument but got a video making fun of people oh you mean the

05:19.640 --> 05:23.620
intelligent counter-argument that we can measure the earth's size and its mass

05:23.620 --> 05:29.940
and neither is growing an observation is not disproved by the inability of the

05:29.940 --> 05:34.220
observer to account for it no an observation is disproved right from the

05:34.220 --> 05:39.140
start when there's no observation look if I stick a rock on some bathroom

05:39.140 --> 05:42.980
scales and measure its dimensions and its weight and leave it overnight and it

05:42.980 --> 05:47.980
hasn't grown in size then I'm not making an observation that it's got bigger is

05:47.980 --> 05:52.900
it just me I explained all this in the video I don't know how much clearer it

05:52.900 --> 05:57.740
can be scientists know the earth isn't growing because just like this rock they

05:57.740 --> 06:01.100
can measure the distance of various points of the earth's surface from

06:01.100 --> 06:05.100
satellites and what they found is exactly what was predicted by plate

06:05.100 --> 06:09.180
tectonics uplift in mountain ranges where plates are colliding and

06:09.180 --> 06:14.020
depression at subduction zones where plates are being pushed down and no net

06:14.020 --> 06:17.820
growth they've measured how much the earth as a whole expands and contracts

06:17.820 --> 06:21.340
every year and found the answer was naught point one millimeters in both

06:21.340 --> 06:27.220
directions with no net expansion and we can measure the Earth's mass too

06:27.220 --> 06:31.460
despite the fact that the earth is neither getting bigger or heavier like

06:31.460 --> 06:36.380
Sylvester the gunslinger the earth is growing if they want it to be growing so

06:36.380 --> 06:41.460
all they need to do is explain why one guy thinks helium is being produced in

06:41.460 --> 06:45.020
the center of the earth and it's blowing up like a balloon another there's a star

06:45.020 --> 06:49.300
inside the earth or the increased mass comes from trapped neutrinos ejected by

06:49.300 --> 06:52.620
the Sun electron valence shells are expanding the Earth's the Sun frozen

06:52.620 --> 06:55.900
gases are erupting through weak points the core is bubbly it's expanding

06:55.900 --> 06:59.540
because it's getting hotter recycled materials and volcanoes are making it

06:59.540 --> 07:05.620
bigger says one guy you're closed-minded and sad no that's not my description of

07:05.620 --> 07:10.700
him that's his description of me can you come up with any of your own theories

07:10.700 --> 07:16.540
no because you don't need my theory to explain something that we know is not

07:16.580 --> 07:22.620
happening several people were convinced that sunlight falling on the earth turns

07:22.620 --> 07:27.060
into matter plant life doesn't add mass also then I must take some biology

07:27.060 --> 07:31.940
classes yes please take some biology classes and if you can't afford them

07:31.940 --> 07:36.360
then take just one biology class and make it on the subject of where plants

07:36.360 --> 07:41.060
get their carbon nitrogen potassium phosphorus and hydrogen from even if

07:41.060 --> 07:45.620
they made sense which they don't we don't need any of these wacky stupid

07:45.620 --> 07:51.140
dreamed up ideas to explain something that's not happening look can we just go

07:51.140 --> 07:55.900
back to the rock see the rock now it's sitting in the garden doing nothing so

07:55.900 --> 08:02.780
what's causing it to get bigger maybe little rock elves no don't try to

08:02.780 --> 08:07.660
explain it it's a stupid question because it's not getting bigger okay

08:07.660 --> 08:12.580
look here's the White House why is it painted red aliens may have needed the

08:13.580 --> 08:17.620
government in secret no I don't need an explanation of why it's painted red

08:17.620 --> 08:23.620
because it's not being painted red don't you get it now please stop because I'm

08:23.620 --> 08:28.580
getting a headache I'm gonna lie down you are astoundingly ignorant let you in

08:28.580 --> 08:33.460
as the earth is growing and growing it is shut up I don't care I assure you the

08:33.460 --> 08:38.020
planet is gaining mass has been getting gas and will continue to do so as long

08:38.020 --> 08:43.780
as it exists will you shut up on a clear night take some time and spend it

08:43.780 --> 08:48.140
gazing at the beautiful night sky and I promise you you shall bear witness to

08:48.140 --> 08:52.460
the miracle of meteors as they crash into the eye to start all over again

08:52.460 --> 08:57.620
behold the truth is but a blink away pothola I am shocked you cannot know

08:57.620 --> 09:04.020
this well you do now oh for sake do some maths all the dust and meteorites

09:04.060 --> 09:09.220
falling from space every year amount to barely 40,000 tons about the size of the

09:09.220 --> 09:13.340
Jefferson Memorial even if it's been a hundred times that amount every year for

09:13.340 --> 09:17.340
the last 60 million years that's still around a trillionth the size of the

09:17.340 --> 09:22.140
earth and it doesn't even come close to doubling its size so why are so many

09:22.140 --> 09:27.380
people having so much trouble accepting basic science the author of the growing

09:27.380 --> 09:31.100
earth video Neil Adams says he questioned science when he learned about

09:31.220 --> 09:35.420
the creation of matter at the start of the Big Bang and it sounded to him like

09:35.420 --> 09:41.060
magic that's why I always advise people to do this multiple choice if something

09:41.060 --> 09:44.820
in science doesn't make sense to them you have to conclude that either

09:44.820 --> 09:50.100
research scientists are all incompetent or they're all in on a conspiracy or

09:50.100 --> 09:56.100
they know something you don't so find out what it is sadly Neil went for

09:56.100 --> 10:01.020
option two and then made up his own science which he calls new science

10:01.020 --> 10:05.900
whenever he was told it conflicted with some fundamental laws of physics he

10:05.900 --> 10:10.060
decided these laws must be wrong yes you can do that when you make up your own

10:10.060 --> 10:15.060
science trouble is it's very easy to prove or disprove a law of physics

10:15.060 --> 10:20.040
because unlike a theory a law is basically a mathematical equation to

10:20.040 --> 10:24.100
disprove it all you have to do is input the figures and show that the equation

10:24.100 --> 10:28.900
doesn't balance so in the comments forum I established upfront which laws

10:28.900 --> 10:34.580
Neil accepts and which he rejects and he told me he doesn't accept this Newton's

10:34.580 --> 10:39.860
law of universal gravitation but for a very interesting reason because the moon

10:39.860 --> 10:45.980
is receding from the earth and Newton says it shouldn't well Newton may say it

10:45.980 --> 10:51.180
shouldn't but Newton's law says it should this was a problem for Newton

10:51.180 --> 10:54.780
because he believed that a god-given universe ought to be perfect and have

10:54.780 --> 10:58.620
perfect orbits his law showed that orbits would be influenced by the

10:58.620 --> 11:03.180
gravitational attraction of other objects so Newton reasoned that God

11:03.180 --> 11:08.100
would make constant adjustments to keep all the orbits stable the way to

11:08.100 --> 11:12.820
disprove Newton's law isn't to invoke Newton's belief in divine intervention

11:12.820 --> 11:18.300
but to input the figures and show the equation doesn't balance so I asked Neil

11:18.300 --> 11:22.500
to show his calculations if the equation doesn't balance then Neil can

11:22.500 --> 11:27.880
definitively prove his new science is right in response to my request here are

11:27.880 --> 11:37.580
his calculations well what were you expecting did you really think he was

11:37.580 --> 11:40.420
going to present the world with a calculation showing that one of the most

11:40.420 --> 11:46.220
famous and fundamental laws of physics is wrong of course not instead when I

11:46.220 --> 11:50.460
asked him to produce his calculations I was met with evasion delay waffle

11:50.460 --> 11:55.140
diversion and of course personal attacks but at the end of it Neil had to admit

11:55.140 --> 11:59.620
he didn't know the figures he hadn't worked it out and what's all this math

11:59.620 --> 12:04.860
got to do with it anyway his ideas he said adjust concepts you don't need math

12:04.860 --> 12:10.300
to work all this out just instinct in fact the law fits perfectly with the

12:10.300 --> 12:15.980
recession of the moon and it's not that hard to see why as the earth rotates the

12:15.980 --> 12:20.380
gravitational attraction of the moon causes a tidal bulge which rotates

12:20.380 --> 12:25.340
ahead of the moon's orbit the effect is to slow the earth down over time and

12:25.340 --> 12:30.860
effectively transfer this energy to the moon taking it into a higher orbit the

12:30.860 --> 12:34.140
law tells us that the force of gravitational attraction is the

12:34.140 --> 12:39.200
universal constant times the mass of the earth times the mass of the moon divided

12:39.200 --> 12:43.740
by the distance between them squared and from Newton's second law we know that

12:43.740 --> 12:48.460
force equals mass times acceleration and centripetal acceleration is the

12:48.460 --> 12:53.540
velocity of the orbiting body squared divided by the radius this may look hard

12:53.540 --> 12:56.900
but it's a simple question of substituting letters in the equation

12:56.900 --> 13:03.060
which we all learn to do in elementary school a is v squared over R so let's do

13:03.060 --> 13:07.980
that substitution and since this force is the same as this force the other two

13:07.980 --> 13:12.540
sides of the equation must also be equal and since some of the values on both

13:12.540 --> 13:17.140
sides of the equation are equal they cancel each other out and so we're left

13:17.140 --> 13:21.140
with an equation that tells us the velocity of the moon squared equals the

13:21.140 --> 13:25.180
gravitational constant times the mass of the earth divided by the distance

13:25.180 --> 13:29.460
between them in other words the law tells us that as the moon moves into a

13:29.460 --> 13:35.220
higher orbit and R increases then the velocity V has to decrease in order for

13:35.220 --> 13:40.580
the equation to balance and that's exactly what we find the law balances

13:40.580 --> 13:44.740
perfectly according to everyone who's worked it out it doesn't balance

13:44.740 --> 13:50.260
according to Neil Adams who hasn't worked it out Neil if you still want to

13:50.260 --> 13:53.900
insist that the law doesn't work in the case of the earth moon orbit then all

13:53.900 --> 13:58.660
you have to do is input your figures and show that you're right why won't he do

13:58.660 --> 14:04.340
it well no prizes for guessing and while he's at it show us how the supposed

14:04.340 --> 14:08.060
increased mass and radius of this growing earth would affect the earth's

14:08.060 --> 14:13.260
rotational velocity which is the other point I raise Neil told me he accepted

14:13.260 --> 14:17.220
the law of conservation of angular momentum but after offering up a variety

14:17.220 --> 14:21.660
of spurious excuses he finally admitted he didn't know whether an increasing

14:21.660 --> 14:26.340
mass and radius would speed up the earth's rotation slow it down or keep it

14:26.340 --> 14:33.180
the same now this is very basic physics on any rotating body either extra mass

14:33.180 --> 14:37.980
or an increasing radius or a combination of both would slow down the

14:37.980 --> 14:42.900
rotational speed and because it's a law of physics once again it's governed by a

14:42.900 --> 14:47.980
mathematical equation so increasing the mass and radius of the earth would make

14:47.980 --> 14:53.900
an earth day longer so here's a tip if you're going to invent a new science and

14:53.900 --> 14:58.060
claim to have all the answers then at least try to familiarize yourself with

14:58.060 --> 15:04.380
the physical laws you claim to accept or reject ok I do sympathize with Neil if

15:04.380 --> 15:08.500
you don't understand scientific explanations for natural phenomena then

15:08.500 --> 15:15.860
of course they must seem like magic in the past people attributed these natural

15:15.860 --> 15:21.540
phenomena to God's goddesses and spirits in this post religious age if they don't

15:21.540 --> 15:25.660
accept the scientific explanations they seek answers in conspiracies

15:28.060 --> 15:34.020
what the heck is in our oxygen supply that create a rainbow effect in a

15:34.020 --> 15:37.900
sprinkler one of the most common things I read on my channel are posts from

15:37.900 --> 15:42.340
people who say they like my videos debunking religious belief but don't

15:42.340 --> 15:46.900
agree with my debunking of whatever it is they believe but the point I'm making

15:46.900 --> 15:50.780
is that if you're going to reject or cherry-pick science to support your

15:50.780 --> 15:55.260
beliefs then it doesn't matter whether those beliefs are religious ideological

15:55.260 --> 16:00.420
humanitarian or anything else you're changing reality to fit your conclusions

16:00.420 --> 16:05.860
that's the exact opposite of science the answer to things we don't understand

16:05.860 --> 16:10.220
isn't to assume that scientists must be conspiring against us but to accept that

16:10.220 --> 16:14.220
we don't understand it take a tip from Clint Eastwood got to know his

16:14.220 --> 16:18.540
limitations so instead of making assertions like dinosaurs could not have

16:18.540 --> 16:22.860
lived on an earth this size put it in the form of a question what do

16:22.860 --> 16:27.580
researchers say allowed dinosaurs to live on an earth this size find out what

16:27.580 --> 16:32.180
it is the researchers know that you don't instead of claiming that the earth

16:32.180 --> 16:36.980
is cooling because ice sheets have increased 60% one year put this in the

16:36.980 --> 16:41.300
form of a question why do researchers still insist that ice sheets are

16:41.300 --> 16:46.380
shrinking in other words instead of assuming a conspiracy find out what it

16:46.380 --> 16:51.940
is they know that you don't sometimes they do ask questions but end up

16:51.940 --> 16:56.180
completely ignoring the answer for example a lot of people asked how the

16:56.180 --> 17:01.420
oldest oceanic crust is much younger than the oldest continental crust this

17:01.420 --> 17:05.980
is something I explained in the video the answer is that oceanic plates are

17:05.980 --> 17:12.140
continuously being created and subducted while continental plates aren't and once

17:12.140 --> 17:15.980
you've asked the question and seen the answer that researchers have laid out in

17:15.980 --> 17:20.260
research journals and textbooks and been shown the measurements and the evidence

17:20.260 --> 17:25.380
don't hide behind scientific conspiracy crap simply because you don't want to

17:25.380 --> 17:30.020
change your beliefs I don't care if you're an atheist an agnostic or the

17:30.020 --> 17:35.740
sugarplum fairy that's no different to religious belief some people wonder why

17:35.740 --> 17:40.860
I bother trying to correct all these idiotic fantasies does it matter yes

17:40.860 --> 17:45.980
science is the foundation of our modern technological society and you should be

17:45.980 --> 17:49.620
worried that an increasing number of people are not only dropping out of

17:49.820 --> 17:53.740
science subjects in school they're turning to whacked-out nonsense based on

17:53.740 --> 17:57.980
the idea that science is all a conspiracy as more people distrust

17:57.980 --> 18:01.420
science they're failing to vaccinate their children we're seeing a

18:01.420 --> 18:06.020
re-emergence of diseases that science had eradicated if governments based

18:06.020 --> 18:11.020
their decisions on superstitions and beliefs rather than on hard science then

18:11.020 --> 18:15.460
we're going to suffer the consequences you know Johannes Kepler spent five

18:15.460 --> 18:20.420
years going through thousands of pieces of observational data to work out how

18:20.420 --> 18:24.500
the planets orbit the Sun he would have given his right arm to have known the

18:24.500 --> 18:29.140
answer we have the luxury of being able to learn about planetary orbits at the

18:29.140 --> 18:34.220
click of a button and we're too lazy or stupid or too uninquiring to do it

18:34.220 --> 18:39.900
instead we'd rather make something up now I've been a bit harsh in this video

18:39.900 --> 18:44.980
so if I've embarrassed anyone or made them look stupid good you should feel

18:45.020 --> 18:49.540
embarrassed you deserve to be laughed at because your brand of stupidity is

18:49.540 --> 18:54.180
dangerous and don't bother telling me how arrogant I am for calling all these

18:54.180 --> 18:58.820
conspiracy theorists stupid because I'm always happy to admit that I'm stupid

18:58.820 --> 19:04.140
too this is one of the few things Neil Adams got right nothing wrong with being

19:04.140 --> 19:08.340
too stupid to understand the kind of science that PhD physicists understand

19:08.340 --> 19:12.420
that's the case not just for me but for ninety nine point nine percent of the

19:12.460 --> 19:17.660
population the difference is I accept that I'm too stupid to understand it so

19:17.660 --> 19:21.340
when something in science doesn't make sense to me I don't assume it's because

19:21.340 --> 19:25.660
scientists are incompetent or devious I either try to find out what it is I

19:25.660 --> 19:30.300
don't understand or if I'm too stupid to wrap my head around it which is often

19:30.300 --> 19:34.180
the case then I follow the Clint Eastwood philosophy and accept my

19:34.180 --> 19:38.940
limitations I don't go bounding off to create my own version of science light

19:38.940 --> 19:42.660
which is science based on belief without the need for any complicated

19:42.660 --> 19:46.140
mathematical equations

19:46.140 --> 19:52.420
he can go for a whole year he can go for a whole year on one grain of rice Neil

19:52.420 --> 19:56.180
Adams has done more to bring the fact of Earth's expansion to millions of people

19:56.180 --> 20:00.860
than anyone oh god another armchair scientist still posting in support of

20:00.860 --> 20:04.980
this crap we have no place in official accepted science thankfully that gives

20:05.020 --> 20:09.220
us the freedom to state our beliefs and theories we're not paid to tow I think

20:09.220 --> 20:14.100
he means tow the line by any university or government agency well if scientific

20:14.100 --> 20:17.660
discoveries at universities and scientific institutions are all

20:17.660 --> 20:23.460
conspiracy-led crap then why bother with it to away with science class in school

20:23.460 --> 20:28.180
and science degrees and scientific research let's all sit in armchairs and

20:28.180 --> 20:32.140
make up theories and put our beliefs into chat rooms and videos and the

20:32.140 --> 20:36.500
belief or theory with the most number of likes gets to be true long live free

20:36.500 --> 20:40.500
thinkers oh is that what you are presumably free from the constraint of

20:40.500 --> 20:45.180
having to make your conclusion fit observations or use math or have your

20:45.180 --> 20:50.780
work fact-checked yeah sounds groovy the problem is while you attack those who

20:50.780 --> 20:54.980
did stay awake in science class and did take the time to study and get degrees

20:54.980 --> 20:59.640
and spend years doing painstaking research for a pittance you have the

20:59.640 --> 21:04.240
gall to use the technology they've created to do it with when you use a

21:04.240 --> 21:07.920
computer to write your comments and blogs you're using a machine that

21:07.920 --> 21:12.320
depends on Ohm's law and Kirchhoff's law when you phone your friends to tell them

21:12.320 --> 21:16.840
Newton's law of universal gravitation is wrong you're using satellite technology

21:16.840 --> 21:20.920
that depends on Newton's law of gravitation to get that message through

21:20.920 --> 21:25.920
when you start your stupid car to attend your stupid meeting with other stupid

21:25.920 --> 21:30.720
new-age flat hollow growing sponge cake earth delusionist nut jobs your starter

21:30.720 --> 21:35.160
motor depends on Faraday's law and the oil it runs on was found using Snell's

21:35.160 --> 21:39.720
law and the engine depends on the laws of thermodynamics so the next time a

21:39.720 --> 21:43.360
stupid thought bubble enters your head and you feel like telling the rest of

21:43.360 --> 21:48.640
the world about it just stop and do what I do if my stupid thought is at odds

21:48.640 --> 21:53.360
with known and accepted science and physical laws then I have only three

21:53.440 --> 21:58.080
options and you know what they are either scientists are all incompetent or

21:58.080 --> 22:03.520
they're all in on a conspiracy or they know something I don't and I need to

22:03.520 --> 22:10.120
find out what that is hint try option three first
