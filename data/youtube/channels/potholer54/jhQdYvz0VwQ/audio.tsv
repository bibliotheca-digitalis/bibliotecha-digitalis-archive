0	5000	now this is the story of the old west and it's a story of a man named
5000	10760	Sylvester and he was a dangerous gunslinger yes this is the pothole of
10760	17360	54 channel just bear with me they were in this bar playing cards and somebody
17360	22040	was cheating and next thing you know they go for their guns the guns are
22040	27760	jerked white gun smoke filled the room Sylvester got hit took a bullet tried to
27760	33520	shoot at him again but he got away he slipped out into the desert he collapsed
33520	39280	his face first into the ground and he's a goner and he starts drying and frying
39280	44400	and mummifying and ends up here at a Hall of Curiosities in Seattle where
44400	48640	visitors gawk at Sylvester's desert dried mummy and take pictures of the
48640	53040	blood-spattered bullet hole that killed him at least that's what Arizona's state
53040	58360	historian Marshall Trimble would have us believe but what does science tell us
58360	63200	well an autopsy of the body revealed it hadn't been mummified by the dry desert
63200	67920	heat at all because it was dripping wet with embalming fluid and scientists who
67920	71880	undertook the autopsy on behalf of the History Channel found that the fluid was
71880	76200	loaded with arsenic a common embalmers chemical used in the late 19th century
76200	81280	and they found the injection points in his legs where the fluid was pumped into
81360	85960	the veins and when they checked the hole in his stomach it wasn't consistent with
85960	91400	a bullet but a drill and the so-called blood spatter around it wasn't blood but
91400	97040	red paint and the autopsy revealed that Sylvester didn't die in a gunfight he
97040	102080	died of tuberculosis so what does Arizona's state historian have to say
102080	107320	now that a scientific analysis has shown that everything he believed was a crock
107320	111160	Sylvester can be anybody we want him to be and I want him to be a gunslinger
111160	116280	that's right he still wants to believe it to some people it doesn't matter what
116280	121080	the evidence is or what the science shows for the truly deluded if we want
121080	125760	the gunslinger story to be true then it's true well it's true for me you see
125760	128720	I believe you mean true for you is different from true for anybody else
128720	134000	it's a mindset a human failing that I've been trying to fathom for years of
134080	137480	course we all know that this kind of delusion is meat and potatoes for
137480	141960	creationists because the eye is so complex here's one asking Richard
141960	145480	Dawkins how evolution could make something as complex as an eye a
145480	150840	question Dawkins was able to answer quite easily you can make a slowly
150840	156600	climbing ramp of improvement from just the very rudiments of vision just say
156600	161180	being able to tell the difference between light and shade nothing more
161180	167140	than that right up to the perfection of a human eye or the eye of a hall I mean
167140	171420	there are flatworms that have just a cup for an eye note no lens not even a pinhole
171420	176020	there are animals like nautilus which is a sort of coiled up squid kind of thing
176020	182260	did you find that convincing I said about the eye well not really now you
182260	186300	might think this guy went on to say he didn't understand the explanation or he
186300	190380	found a flaw in the explanation or he questioned the evidence that supported
190380	196820	it but no none of these so what was the reason he didn't accept it let me tell
196820	200500	you what what happened in my brain at that particular moment in time was that
200500	205140	I was thinking of the book of Genesis and where God says that he made
205140	208940	everything according to its kind okay you're probably not all that surprised
208940	214140	after all he's a creationist but this video isn't about why religious people
214140	218380	delude themselves into disbelieving observable evidence and thinking that
218380	222900	science is all a conspiracy it's about why we still have that affliction even
222900	227300	in a post religious world in Western countries where religion is in decline
227300	231860	people aren't necessarily falling in line with science and rational thinking
231860	235780	instead they're turning to wacky ideas they hear from the internet and
235780	240500	believing as Bill O'Reilly would put it that even though science tells us it's
240500	245420	wrong it's true for them it's as if the need to believe is so ingrained in us
245420	250140	that having dispensed with gods and goddesses we now have to substitute new
250140	254860	beliefs that continue to contradict scientific evidence I don't think
254860	258980	there's a better example of this than the weird and wacky responses I got to
258980	264540	my video expanding earth my ass the video debunked the hilariously stupid
264540	269180	claim of comic book artist Neil Adams that the earth is growing and has
269180	273620	doubled in size over the last 60 million years it's a shame that this video takes
274500	279780	yes I must admit the video did take on a rather mocking tone after all I thought
279780	284100	no one still believes in a flat earth an expanding earth a hollow earth or an
284100	288940	earth made out of sponge cake these are ideas expounded by lone nutcases who
288940	292500	used to sit next to you in a pub and bother you with their conspiracy
292500	301460	theories but I hadn't counted on the power of the internet to bring all these
301460	306020	lone nutcases and their myriad conspiracy theories together into one
306020	310820	virtual room just like Sylvester the gunslinger the physics of the earth can
310820	315540	be whatever they want it to be I watched this video expecting an intelligent
315540	319640	counter-argument but got a video making fun of people oh you mean the
319640	323620	intelligent counter-argument that we can measure the earth's size and its mass
323620	329940	and neither is growing an observation is not disproved by the inability of the
329940	334220	observer to account for it no an observation is disproved right from the
334220	339140	start when there's no observation look if I stick a rock on some bathroom
339140	342980	scales and measure its dimensions and its weight and leave it overnight and it
342980	347980	hasn't grown in size then I'm not making an observation that it's got bigger is
347980	352900	it just me I explained all this in the video I don't know how much clearer it
352900	357740	can be scientists know the earth isn't growing because just like this rock they
357740	361100	can measure the distance of various points of the earth's surface from
361100	365100	satellites and what they found is exactly what was predicted by plate
365100	369180	tectonics uplift in mountain ranges where plates are colliding and
369180	374020	depression at subduction zones where plates are being pushed down and no net
374020	377820	growth they've measured how much the earth as a whole expands and contracts
377820	381340	every year and found the answer was naught point one millimeters in both
381340	387220	directions with no net expansion and we can measure the Earth's mass too
387220	391460	despite the fact that the earth is neither getting bigger or heavier like
391460	396380	Sylvester the gunslinger the earth is growing if they want it to be growing so
396380	401460	all they need to do is explain why one guy thinks helium is being produced in
401460	405020	the center of the earth and it's blowing up like a balloon another there's a star
405020	409300	inside the earth or the increased mass comes from trapped neutrinos ejected by
409300	412620	the Sun electron valence shells are expanding the Earth's the Sun frozen
412620	415900	gases are erupting through weak points the core is bubbly it's expanding
415900	419540	because it's getting hotter recycled materials and volcanoes are making it
419540	425620	bigger says one guy you're closed-minded and sad no that's not my description of
425620	430700	him that's his description of me can you come up with any of your own theories
430700	436540	no because you don't need my theory to explain something that we know is not
436580	442620	happening several people were convinced that sunlight falling on the earth turns
442620	447060	into matter plant life doesn't add mass also then I must take some biology
447060	451940	classes yes please take some biology classes and if you can't afford them
451940	456360	then take just one biology class and make it on the subject of where plants
456360	461060	get their carbon nitrogen potassium phosphorus and hydrogen from even if
461060	465620	they made sense which they don't we don't need any of these wacky stupid
465620	471140	dreamed up ideas to explain something that's not happening look can we just go
471140	475900	back to the rock see the rock now it's sitting in the garden doing nothing so
475900	482780	what's causing it to get bigger maybe little rock elves no don't try to
482780	487660	explain it it's a stupid question because it's not getting bigger okay
487660	492580	look here's the White House why is it painted red aliens may have needed the
493580	497620	government in secret no I don't need an explanation of why it's painted red
497620	503620	because it's not being painted red don't you get it now please stop because I'm
503620	508580	getting a headache I'm gonna lie down you are astoundingly ignorant let you in
508580	513460	as the earth is growing and growing it is shut up I don't care I assure you the
513460	518020	planet is gaining mass has been getting gas and will continue to do so as long
518020	523780	as it exists will you shut up on a clear night take some time and spend it
523780	528140	gazing at the beautiful night sky and I promise you you shall bear witness to
528140	532460	the miracle of meteors as they crash into the eye to start all over again
532460	537620	behold the truth is but a blink away pothola I am shocked you cannot know
537620	544020	this well you do now oh for sake do some maths all the dust and meteorites
544060	549220	falling from space every year amount to barely 40,000 tons about the size of the
549220	553340	Jefferson Memorial even if it's been a hundred times that amount every year for
553340	557340	the last 60 million years that's still around a trillionth the size of the
557340	562140	earth and it doesn't even come close to doubling its size so why are so many
562140	567380	people having so much trouble accepting basic science the author of the growing
567380	571100	earth video Neil Adams says he questioned science when he learned about
571220	575420	the creation of matter at the start of the Big Bang and it sounded to him like
575420	581060	magic that's why I always advise people to do this multiple choice if something
581060	584820	in science doesn't make sense to them you have to conclude that either
584820	590100	research scientists are all incompetent or they're all in on a conspiracy or
590100	596100	they know something you don't so find out what it is sadly Neil went for
596100	601020	option two and then made up his own science which he calls new science
601020	605900	whenever he was told it conflicted with some fundamental laws of physics he
605900	610060	decided these laws must be wrong yes you can do that when you make up your own
610060	615060	science trouble is it's very easy to prove or disprove a law of physics
615060	620040	because unlike a theory a law is basically a mathematical equation to
620040	624100	disprove it all you have to do is input the figures and show that the equation
624100	628900	doesn't balance so in the comments forum I established upfront which laws
628900	634580	Neil accepts and which he rejects and he told me he doesn't accept this Newton's
634580	639860	law of universal gravitation but for a very interesting reason because the moon
639860	645980	is receding from the earth and Newton says it shouldn't well Newton may say it
645980	651180	shouldn't but Newton's law says it should this was a problem for Newton
651180	654780	because he believed that a god-given universe ought to be perfect and have
654780	658620	perfect orbits his law showed that orbits would be influenced by the
658620	663180	gravitational attraction of other objects so Newton reasoned that God
663180	668100	would make constant adjustments to keep all the orbits stable the way to
668100	672820	disprove Newton's law isn't to invoke Newton's belief in divine intervention
672820	678300	but to input the figures and show the equation doesn't balance so I asked Neil
678300	682500	to show his calculations if the equation doesn't balance then Neil can
682500	687880	definitively prove his new science is right in response to my request here are
687880	697580	his calculations well what were you expecting did you really think he was
697580	700420	going to present the world with a calculation showing that one of the most
700420	706220	famous and fundamental laws of physics is wrong of course not instead when I
706220	710460	asked him to produce his calculations I was met with evasion delay waffle
710460	715140	diversion and of course personal attacks but at the end of it Neil had to admit
715140	719620	he didn't know the figures he hadn't worked it out and what's all this math
719620	724860	got to do with it anyway his ideas he said adjust concepts you don't need math
724860	730300	to work all this out just instinct in fact the law fits perfectly with the
730300	735980	recession of the moon and it's not that hard to see why as the earth rotates the
735980	740380	gravitational attraction of the moon causes a tidal bulge which rotates
740380	745340	ahead of the moon's orbit the effect is to slow the earth down over time and
745340	750860	effectively transfer this energy to the moon taking it into a higher orbit the
750860	754140	law tells us that the force of gravitational attraction is the
754140	759200	universal constant times the mass of the earth times the mass of the moon divided
759200	763740	by the distance between them squared and from Newton's second law we know that
763740	768460	force equals mass times acceleration and centripetal acceleration is the
768460	773540	velocity of the orbiting body squared divided by the radius this may look hard
773540	776900	but it's a simple question of substituting letters in the equation
776900	783060	which we all learn to do in elementary school a is v squared over R so let's do
783060	787980	that substitution and since this force is the same as this force the other two
787980	792540	sides of the equation must also be equal and since some of the values on both
792540	797140	sides of the equation are equal they cancel each other out and so we're left
797140	801140	with an equation that tells us the velocity of the moon squared equals the
801140	805180	gravitational constant times the mass of the earth divided by the distance
805180	809460	between them in other words the law tells us that as the moon moves into a
809460	815220	higher orbit and R increases then the velocity V has to decrease in order for
815220	820580	the equation to balance and that's exactly what we find the law balances
820580	824740	perfectly according to everyone who's worked it out it doesn't balance
824740	830260	according to Neil Adams who hasn't worked it out Neil if you still want to
830260	833900	insist that the law doesn't work in the case of the earth moon orbit then all
833900	838660	you have to do is input your figures and show that you're right why won't he do
838660	844340	it well no prizes for guessing and while he's at it show us how the supposed
844340	848060	increased mass and radius of this growing earth would affect the earth's
848060	853260	rotational velocity which is the other point I raise Neil told me he accepted
853260	857220	the law of conservation of angular momentum but after offering up a variety
857220	861660	of spurious excuses he finally admitted he didn't know whether an increasing
861660	866340	mass and radius would speed up the earth's rotation slow it down or keep it
866340	873180	the same now this is very basic physics on any rotating body either extra mass
873180	877980	or an increasing radius or a combination of both would slow down the
877980	882900	rotational speed and because it's a law of physics once again it's governed by a
882900	887980	mathematical equation so increasing the mass and radius of the earth would make
887980	893900	an earth day longer so here's a tip if you're going to invent a new science and
893900	898060	claim to have all the answers then at least try to familiarize yourself with
898060	904380	the physical laws you claim to accept or reject ok I do sympathize with Neil if
904380	908500	you don't understand scientific explanations for natural phenomena then
908500	915860	of course they must seem like magic in the past people attributed these natural
915860	921540	phenomena to God's goddesses and spirits in this post religious age if they don't
921540	925660	accept the scientific explanations they seek answers in conspiracies
928060	934020	what the heck is in our oxygen supply that create a rainbow effect in a
934020	937900	sprinkler one of the most common things I read on my channel are posts from
937900	942340	people who say they like my videos debunking religious belief but don't
942340	946900	agree with my debunking of whatever it is they believe but the point I'm making
946900	950780	is that if you're going to reject or cherry-pick science to support your
950780	955260	beliefs then it doesn't matter whether those beliefs are religious ideological
955260	960420	humanitarian or anything else you're changing reality to fit your conclusions
960420	965860	that's the exact opposite of science the answer to things we don't understand
965860	970220	isn't to assume that scientists must be conspiring against us but to accept that
970220	974220	we don't understand it take a tip from Clint Eastwood got to know his
974220	978540	limitations so instead of making assertions like dinosaurs could not have
978540	982860	lived on an earth this size put it in the form of a question what do
982860	987580	researchers say allowed dinosaurs to live on an earth this size find out what
987580	992180	it is the researchers know that you don't instead of claiming that the earth
992180	996980	is cooling because ice sheets have increased 60% one year put this in the
996980	1001300	form of a question why do researchers still insist that ice sheets are
1001300	1006380	shrinking in other words instead of assuming a conspiracy find out what it
1006380	1011940	is they know that you don't sometimes they do ask questions but end up
1011940	1016180	completely ignoring the answer for example a lot of people asked how the
1016180	1021420	oldest oceanic crust is much younger than the oldest continental crust this
1021420	1025980	is something I explained in the video the answer is that oceanic plates are
1025980	1032140	continuously being created and subducted while continental plates aren't and once
1032140	1035980	you've asked the question and seen the answer that researchers have laid out in
1035980	1040260	research journals and textbooks and been shown the measurements and the evidence
1040260	1045380	don't hide behind scientific conspiracy crap simply because you don't want to
1045380	1050020	change your beliefs I don't care if you're an atheist an agnostic or the
1050020	1055740	sugarplum fairy that's no different to religious belief some people wonder why
1055740	1060860	I bother trying to correct all these idiotic fantasies does it matter yes
1060860	1065980	science is the foundation of our modern technological society and you should be
1065980	1069620	worried that an increasing number of people are not only dropping out of
1069820	1073740	science subjects in school they're turning to whacked-out nonsense based on
1073740	1077980	the idea that science is all a conspiracy as more people distrust
1077980	1081420	science they're failing to vaccinate their children we're seeing a
1081420	1086020	re-emergence of diseases that science had eradicated if governments based
1086020	1091020	their decisions on superstitions and beliefs rather than on hard science then
1091020	1095460	we're going to suffer the consequences you know Johannes Kepler spent five
1095460	1100420	years going through thousands of pieces of observational data to work out how
1100420	1104500	the planets orbit the Sun he would have given his right arm to have known the
1104500	1109140	answer we have the luxury of being able to learn about planetary orbits at the
1109140	1114220	click of a button and we're too lazy or stupid or too uninquiring to do it
1114220	1119900	instead we'd rather make something up now I've been a bit harsh in this video
1119900	1124980	so if I've embarrassed anyone or made them look stupid good you should feel
1125020	1129540	embarrassed you deserve to be laughed at because your brand of stupidity is
1129540	1134180	dangerous and don't bother telling me how arrogant I am for calling all these
1134180	1138820	conspiracy theorists stupid because I'm always happy to admit that I'm stupid
1138820	1144140	too this is one of the few things Neil Adams got right nothing wrong with being
1144140	1148340	too stupid to understand the kind of science that PhD physicists understand
1148340	1152420	that's the case not just for me but for ninety nine point nine percent of the
1152460	1157660	population the difference is I accept that I'm too stupid to understand it so
1157660	1161340	when something in science doesn't make sense to me I don't assume it's because
1161340	1165660	scientists are incompetent or devious I either try to find out what it is I
1165660	1170300	don't understand or if I'm too stupid to wrap my head around it which is often
1170300	1174180	the case then I follow the Clint Eastwood philosophy and accept my
1174180	1178940	limitations I don't go bounding off to create my own version of science light
1178940	1182660	which is science based on belief without the need for any complicated
1182660	1186140	mathematical equations
1186140	1192420	he can go for a whole year he can go for a whole year on one grain of rice Neil
1192420	1196180	Adams has done more to bring the fact of Earth's expansion to millions of people
1196180	1200860	than anyone oh god another armchair scientist still posting in support of
1200860	1204980	this crap we have no place in official accepted science thankfully that gives
1205020	1209220	us the freedom to state our beliefs and theories we're not paid to tow I think
1209220	1214100	he means tow the line by any university or government agency well if scientific
1214100	1217660	discoveries at universities and scientific institutions are all
1217660	1223460	conspiracy-led crap then why bother with it to away with science class in school
1223460	1228180	and science degrees and scientific research let's all sit in armchairs and
1228180	1232140	make up theories and put our beliefs into chat rooms and videos and the
1232140	1236500	belief or theory with the most number of likes gets to be true long live free
1236500	1240500	thinkers oh is that what you are presumably free from the constraint of
1240500	1245180	having to make your conclusion fit observations or use math or have your
1245180	1250780	work fact-checked yeah sounds groovy the problem is while you attack those who
1250780	1254980	did stay awake in science class and did take the time to study and get degrees
1254980	1259640	and spend years doing painstaking research for a pittance you have the
1259640	1264240	gall to use the technology they've created to do it with when you use a
1264240	1267920	computer to write your comments and blogs you're using a machine that
1267920	1272320	depends on Ohm's law and Kirchhoff's law when you phone your friends to tell them
1272320	1276840	Newton's law of universal gravitation is wrong you're using satellite technology
1276840	1280920	that depends on Newton's law of gravitation to get that message through
1280920	1285920	when you start your stupid car to attend your stupid meeting with other stupid
1285920	1290720	new-age flat hollow growing sponge cake earth delusionist nut jobs your starter
1290720	1295160	motor depends on Faraday's law and the oil it runs on was found using Snell's
1295160	1299720	law and the engine depends on the laws of thermodynamics so the next time a
1299720	1303360	stupid thought bubble enters your head and you feel like telling the rest of
1303360	1308640	the world about it just stop and do what I do if my stupid thought is at odds
1308640	1313360	with known and accepted science and physical laws then I have only three
1313440	1318080	options and you know what they are either scientists are all incompetent or
1318080	1323520	they're all in on a conspiracy or they know something I don't and I need to
1323520	1330120	find out what that is hint try option three first
