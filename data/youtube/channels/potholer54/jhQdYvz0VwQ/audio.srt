1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
now this is the story of the old west and it's a story of a man named

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:10,760
Sylvester and he was a dangerous gunslinger yes this is the pothole of

3
00:00:10,760 --> 00:00:17,360
54 channel just bear with me they were in this bar playing cards and somebody

4
00:00:17,360 --> 00:00:22,040
was cheating and next thing you know they go for their guns the guns are

5
00:00:22,040 --> 00:00:27,760
jerked white gun smoke filled the room Sylvester got hit took a bullet tried to

6
00:00:27,760 --> 00:00:33,520
shoot at him again but he got away he slipped out into the desert he collapsed

7
00:00:33,520 --> 00:00:39,280
his face first into the ground and he's a goner and he starts drying and frying

8
00:00:39,280 --> 00:00:44,400
and mummifying and ends up here at a Hall of Curiosities in Seattle where

9
00:00:44,400 --> 00:00:48,640
visitors gawk at Sylvester's desert dried mummy and take pictures of the

10
00:00:48,640 --> 00:00:53,040
blood-spattered bullet hole that killed him at least that's what Arizona's state

11
00:00:53,040 --> 00:00:58,360
historian Marshall Trimble would have us believe but what does science tell us

12
00:00:58,360 --> 00:01:03,200
well an autopsy of the body revealed it hadn't been mummified by the dry desert

13
00:01:03,200 --> 00:01:07,920
heat at all because it was dripping wet with embalming fluid and scientists who

14
00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:11,880
undertook the autopsy on behalf of the History Channel found that the fluid was

15
00:01:11,880 --> 00:01:16,200
loaded with arsenic a common embalmers chemical used in the late 19th century

16
00:01:16,200 --> 00:01:21,280
and they found the injection points in his legs where the fluid was pumped into

17
00:01:21,360 --> 00:01:25,960
the veins and when they checked the hole in his stomach it wasn't consistent with

18
00:01:25,960 --> 00:01:31,400
a bullet but a drill and the so-called blood spatter around it wasn't blood but

19
00:01:31,400 --> 00:01:37,040
red paint and the autopsy revealed that Sylvester didn't die in a gunfight he

20
00:01:37,040 --> 00:01:42,080
died of tuberculosis so what does Arizona's state historian have to say

21
00:01:42,080 --> 00:01:47,320
now that a scientific analysis has shown that everything he believed was a crock

22
00:01:47,320 --> 00:01:51,160
Sylvester can be anybody we want him to be and I want him to be a gunslinger

23
00:01:51,160 --> 00:01:56,280
that's right he still wants to believe it to some people it doesn't matter what

24
00:01:56,280 --> 00:02:01,080
the evidence is or what the science shows for the truly deluded if we want

25
00:02:01,080 --> 00:02:05,760
the gunslinger story to be true then it's true well it's true for me you see

26
00:02:05,760 --> 00:02:08,720
I believe you mean true for you is different from true for anybody else

27
00:02:08,720 --> 00:02:14,000
it's a mindset a human failing that I've been trying to fathom for years of

28
00:02:14,080 --> 00:02:17,480
course we all know that this kind of delusion is meat and potatoes for

29
00:02:17,480 --> 00:02:21,960
creationists because the eye is so complex here's one asking Richard

30
00:02:21,960 --> 00:02:25,480
Dawkins how evolution could make something as complex as an eye a

31
00:02:25,480 --> 00:02:30,840
question Dawkins was able to answer quite easily you can make a slowly

32
00:02:30,840 --> 00:02:36,600
climbing ramp of improvement from just the very rudiments of vision just say

33
00:02:36,600 --> 00:02:41,180
being able to tell the difference between light and shade nothing more

34
00:02:41,180 --> 00:02:47,140
than that right up to the perfection of a human eye or the eye of a hall I mean

35
00:02:47,140 --> 00:02:51,420
there are flatworms that have just a cup for an eye note no lens not even a pinhole

36
00:02:51,420 --> 00:02:56,020
there are animals like nautilus which is a sort of coiled up squid kind of thing

37
00:02:56,020 --> 00:03:02,260
did you find that convincing I said about the eye well not really now you

38
00:03:02,260 --> 00:03:06,300
might think this guy went on to say he didn't understand the explanation or he

39
00:03:06,300 --> 00:03:10,380
found a flaw in the explanation or he questioned the evidence that supported

40
00:03:10,380 --> 00:03:16,820
it but no none of these so what was the reason he didn't accept it let me tell

41
00:03:16,820 --> 00:03:20,500
you what what happened in my brain at that particular moment in time was that

42
00:03:20,500 --> 00:03:25,140
I was thinking of the book of Genesis and where God says that he made

43
00:03:25,140 --> 00:03:28,940
everything according to its kind okay you're probably not all that surprised

44
00:03:28,940 --> 00:03:34,140
after all he's a creationist but this video isn't about why religious people

45
00:03:34,140 --> 00:03:38,380
delude themselves into disbelieving observable evidence and thinking that

46
00:03:38,380 --> 00:03:42,900
science is all a conspiracy it's about why we still have that affliction even

47
00:03:42,900 --> 00:03:47,300
in a post religious world in Western countries where religion is in decline

48
00:03:47,300 --> 00:03:51,860
people aren't necessarily falling in line with science and rational thinking

49
00:03:51,860 --> 00:03:55,780
instead they're turning to wacky ideas they hear from the internet and

50
00:03:55,780 --> 00:04:00,500
believing as Bill O'Reilly would put it that even though science tells us it's

51
00:04:00,500 --> 00:04:05,420
wrong it's true for them it's as if the need to believe is so ingrained in us

52
00:04:05,420 --> 00:04:10,140
that having dispensed with gods and goddesses we now have to substitute new

53
00:04:10,140 --> 00:04:14,860
beliefs that continue to contradict scientific evidence I don't think

54
00:04:14,860 --> 00:04:18,980
there's a better example of this than the weird and wacky responses I got to

55
00:04:18,980 --> 00:04:24,540
my video expanding earth my ass the video debunked the hilariously stupid

56
00:04:24,540 --> 00:04:29,180
claim of comic book artist Neil Adams that the earth is growing and has

57
00:04:29,180 --> 00:04:33,620
doubled in size over the last 60 million years it's a shame that this video takes

58
00:04:34,500 --> 00:04:39,780
yes I must admit the video did take on a rather mocking tone after all I thought

59
00:04:39,780 --> 00:04:44,100
no one still believes in a flat earth an expanding earth a hollow earth or an

60
00:04:44,100 --> 00:04:48,940
earth made out of sponge cake these are ideas expounded by lone nutcases who

61
00:04:48,940 --> 00:04:52,500
used to sit next to you in a pub and bother you with their conspiracy

62
00:04:52,500 --> 00:05:01,460
theories but I hadn't counted on the power of the internet to bring all these

63
00:05:01,460 --> 00:05:06,020
lone nutcases and their myriad conspiracy theories together into one

64
00:05:06,020 --> 00:05:10,820
virtual room just like Sylvester the gunslinger the physics of the earth can

65
00:05:10,820 --> 00:05:15,540
be whatever they want it to be I watched this video expecting an intelligent

66
00:05:15,540 --> 00:05:19,640
counter-argument but got a video making fun of people oh you mean the

67
00:05:19,640 --> 00:05:23,620
intelligent counter-argument that we can measure the earth's size and its mass

68
00:05:23,620 --> 00:05:29,940
and neither is growing an observation is not disproved by the inability of the

69
00:05:29,940 --> 00:05:34,220
observer to account for it no an observation is disproved right from the

70
00:05:34,220 --> 00:05:39,140
start when there's no observation look if I stick a rock on some bathroom

71
00:05:39,140 --> 00:05:42,980
scales and measure its dimensions and its weight and leave it overnight and it

72
00:05:42,980 --> 00:05:47,980
hasn't grown in size then I'm not making an observation that it's got bigger is

73
00:05:47,980 --> 00:05:52,900
it just me I explained all this in the video I don't know how much clearer it

74
00:05:52,900 --> 00:05:57,740
can be scientists know the earth isn't growing because just like this rock they

75
00:05:57,740 --> 00:06:01,100
can measure the distance of various points of the earth's surface from

76
00:06:01,100 --> 00:06:05,100
satellites and what they found is exactly what was predicted by plate

77
00:06:05,100 --> 00:06:09,180
tectonics uplift in mountain ranges where plates are colliding and

78
00:06:09,180 --> 00:06:14,020
depression at subduction zones where plates are being pushed down and no net

79
00:06:14,020 --> 00:06:17,820
growth they've measured how much the earth as a whole expands and contracts

80
00:06:17,820 --> 00:06:21,340
every year and found the answer was naught point one millimeters in both

81
00:06:21,340 --> 00:06:27,220
directions with no net expansion and we can measure the Earth's mass too

82
00:06:27,220 --> 00:06:31,460
despite the fact that the earth is neither getting bigger or heavier like

83
00:06:31,460 --> 00:06:36,380
Sylvester the gunslinger the earth is growing if they want it to be growing so

84
00:06:36,380 --> 00:06:41,460
all they need to do is explain why one guy thinks helium is being produced in

85
00:06:41,460 --> 00:06:45,020
the center of the earth and it's blowing up like a balloon another there's a star

86
00:06:45,020 --> 00:06:49,300
inside the earth or the increased mass comes from trapped neutrinos ejected by

87
00:06:49,300 --> 00:06:52,620
the Sun electron valence shells are expanding the Earth's the Sun frozen

88
00:06:52,620 --> 00:06:55,900
gases are erupting through weak points the core is bubbly it's expanding

89
00:06:55,900 --> 00:06:59,540
because it's getting hotter recycled materials and volcanoes are making it

90
00:06:59,540 --> 00:07:05,620
bigger says one guy you're closed-minded and sad no that's not my description of

91
00:07:05,620 --> 00:07:10,700
him that's his description of me can you come up with any of your own theories

92
00:07:10,700 --> 00:07:16,540
no because you don't need my theory to explain something that we know is not

93
00:07:16,580 --> 00:07:22,620
happening several people were convinced that sunlight falling on the earth turns

94
00:07:22,620 --> 00:07:27,060
into matter plant life doesn't add mass also then I must take some biology

95
00:07:27,060 --> 00:07:31,940
classes yes please take some biology classes and if you can't afford them

96
00:07:31,940 --> 00:07:36,360
then take just one biology class and make it on the subject of where plants

97
00:07:36,360 --> 00:07:41,060
get their carbon nitrogen potassium phosphorus and hydrogen from even if

98
00:07:41,060 --> 00:07:45,620
they made sense which they don't we don't need any of these wacky stupid

99
00:07:45,620 --> 00:07:51,140
dreamed up ideas to explain something that's not happening look can we just go

100
00:07:51,140 --> 00:07:55,900
back to the rock see the rock now it's sitting in the garden doing nothing so

101
00:07:55,900 --> 00:08:02,780
what's causing it to get bigger maybe little rock elves no don't try to

102
00:08:02,780 --> 00:08:07,660
explain it it's a stupid question because it's not getting bigger okay

103
00:08:07,660 --> 00:08:12,580
look here's the White House why is it painted red aliens may have needed the

104
00:08:13,580 --> 00:08:17,620
government in secret no I don't need an explanation of why it's painted red

105
00:08:17,620 --> 00:08:23,620
because it's not being painted red don't you get it now please stop because I'm

106
00:08:23,620 --> 00:08:28,580
getting a headache I'm gonna lie down you are astoundingly ignorant let you in

107
00:08:28,580 --> 00:08:33,460
as the earth is growing and growing it is shut up I don't care I assure you the

108
00:08:33,460 --> 00:08:38,020
planet is gaining mass has been getting gas and will continue to do so as long

109
00:08:38,020 --> 00:08:43,780
as it exists will you shut up on a clear night take some time and spend it

110
00:08:43,780 --> 00:08:48,140
gazing at the beautiful night sky and I promise you you shall bear witness to

111
00:08:48,140 --> 00:08:52,460
the miracle of meteors as they crash into the eye to start all over again

112
00:08:52,460 --> 00:08:57,620
behold the truth is but a blink away pothola I am shocked you cannot know

113
00:08:57,620 --> 00:09:04,020
this well you do now oh for sake do some maths all the dust and meteorites

114
00:09:04,060 --> 00:09:09,220
falling from space every year amount to barely 40,000 tons about the size of the

115
00:09:09,220 --> 00:09:13,340
Jefferson Memorial even if it's been a hundred times that amount every year for

116
00:09:13,340 --> 00:09:17,340
the last 60 million years that's still around a trillionth the size of the

117
00:09:17,340 --> 00:09:22,140
earth and it doesn't even come close to doubling its size so why are so many

118
00:09:22,140 --> 00:09:27,380
people having so much trouble accepting basic science the author of the growing

119
00:09:27,380 --> 00:09:31,100
earth video Neil Adams says he questioned science when he learned about

120
00:09:31,220 --> 00:09:35,420
the creation of matter at the start of the Big Bang and it sounded to him like

121
00:09:35,420 --> 00:09:41,060
magic that's why I always advise people to do this multiple choice if something

122
00:09:41,060 --> 00:09:44,820
in science doesn't make sense to them you have to conclude that either

123
00:09:44,820 --> 00:09:50,100
research scientists are all incompetent or they're all in on a conspiracy or

124
00:09:50,100 --> 00:09:56,100
they know something you don't so find out what it is sadly Neil went for

125
00:09:56,100 --> 00:10:01,020
option two and then made up his own science which he calls new science

126
00:10:01,020 --> 00:10:05,900
whenever he was told it conflicted with some fundamental laws of physics he

127
00:10:05,900 --> 00:10:10,060
decided these laws must be wrong yes you can do that when you make up your own

128
00:10:10,060 --> 00:10:15,060
science trouble is it's very easy to prove or disprove a law of physics

129
00:10:15,060 --> 00:10:20,040
because unlike a theory a law is basically a mathematical equation to

130
00:10:20,040 --> 00:10:24,100
disprove it all you have to do is input the figures and show that the equation

131
00:10:24,100 --> 00:10:28,900
doesn't balance so in the comments forum I established upfront which laws

132
00:10:28,900 --> 00:10:34,580
Neil accepts and which he rejects and he told me he doesn't accept this Newton's

133
00:10:34,580 --> 00:10:39,860
law of universal gravitation but for a very interesting reason because the moon

134
00:10:39,860 --> 00:10:45,980
is receding from the earth and Newton says it shouldn't well Newton may say it

135
00:10:45,980 --> 00:10:51,180
shouldn't but Newton's law says it should this was a problem for Newton

136
00:10:51,180 --> 00:10:54,780
because he believed that a god-given universe ought to be perfect and have

137
00:10:54,780 --> 00:10:58,620
perfect orbits his law showed that orbits would be influenced by the

138
00:10:58,620 --> 00:11:03,180
gravitational attraction of other objects so Newton reasoned that God

139
00:11:03,180 --> 00:11:08,100
would make constant adjustments to keep all the orbits stable the way to

140
00:11:08,100 --> 00:11:12,820
disprove Newton's law isn't to invoke Newton's belief in divine intervention

141
00:11:12,820 --> 00:11:18,300
but to input the figures and show the equation doesn't balance so I asked Neil

142
00:11:18,300 --> 00:11:22,500
to show his calculations if the equation doesn't balance then Neil can

143
00:11:22,500 --> 00:11:27,880
definitively prove his new science is right in response to my request here are

144
00:11:27,880 --> 00:11:37,580
his calculations well what were you expecting did you really think he was

145
00:11:37,580 --> 00:11:40,420
going to present the world with a calculation showing that one of the most

146
00:11:40,420 --> 00:11:46,220
famous and fundamental laws of physics is wrong of course not instead when I

147
00:11:46,220 --> 00:11:50,460
asked him to produce his calculations I was met with evasion delay waffle

148
00:11:50,460 --> 00:11:55,140
diversion and of course personal attacks but at the end of it Neil had to admit

149
00:11:55,140 --> 00:11:59,620
he didn't know the figures he hadn't worked it out and what's all this math

150
00:11:59,620 --> 00:12:04,860
got to do with it anyway his ideas he said adjust concepts you don't need math

151
00:12:04,860 --> 00:12:10,300
to work all this out just instinct in fact the law fits perfectly with the

152
00:12:10,300 --> 00:12:15,980
recession of the moon and it's not that hard to see why as the earth rotates the

153
00:12:15,980 --> 00:12:20,380
gravitational attraction of the moon causes a tidal bulge which rotates

154
00:12:20,380 --> 00:12:25,340
ahead of the moon's orbit the effect is to slow the earth down over time and

155
00:12:25,340 --> 00:12:30,860
effectively transfer this energy to the moon taking it into a higher orbit the

156
00:12:30,860 --> 00:12:34,140
law tells us that the force of gravitational attraction is the

157
00:12:34,140 --> 00:12:39,200
universal constant times the mass of the earth times the mass of the moon divided

158
00:12:39,200 --> 00:12:43,740
by the distance between them squared and from Newton's second law we know that

159
00:12:43,740 --> 00:12:48,460
force equals mass times acceleration and centripetal acceleration is the

160
00:12:48,460 --> 00:12:53,540
velocity of the orbiting body squared divided by the radius this may look hard

161
00:12:53,540 --> 00:12:56,900
but it's a simple question of substituting letters in the equation

162
00:12:56,900 --> 00:13:03,060
which we all learn to do in elementary school a is v squared over R so let's do

163
00:13:03,060 --> 00:13:07,980
that substitution and since this force is the same as this force the other two

164
00:13:07,980 --> 00:13:12,540
sides of the equation must also be equal and since some of the values on both

165
00:13:12,540 --> 00:13:17,140
sides of the equation are equal they cancel each other out and so we're left

166
00:13:17,140 --> 00:13:21,140
with an equation that tells us the velocity of the moon squared equals the

167
00:13:21,140 --> 00:13:25,180
gravitational constant times the mass of the earth divided by the distance

168
00:13:25,180 --> 00:13:29,460
between them in other words the law tells us that as the moon moves into a

169
00:13:29,460 --> 00:13:35,220
higher orbit and R increases then the velocity V has to decrease in order for

170
00:13:35,220 --> 00:13:40,580
the equation to balance and that's exactly what we find the law balances

171
00:13:40,580 --> 00:13:44,740
perfectly according to everyone who's worked it out it doesn't balance

172
00:13:44,740 --> 00:13:50,260
according to Neil Adams who hasn't worked it out Neil if you still want to

173
00:13:50,260 --> 00:13:53,900
insist that the law doesn't work in the case of the earth moon orbit then all

174
00:13:53,900 --> 00:13:58,660
you have to do is input your figures and show that you're right why won't he do

175
00:13:58,660 --> 00:14:04,340
it well no prizes for guessing and while he's at it show us how the supposed

176
00:14:04,340 --> 00:14:08,060
increased mass and radius of this growing earth would affect the earth's

177
00:14:08,060 --> 00:14:13,260
rotational velocity which is the other point I raise Neil told me he accepted

178
00:14:13,260 --> 00:14:17,220
the law of conservation of angular momentum but after offering up a variety

179
00:14:17,220 --> 00:14:21,660
of spurious excuses he finally admitted he didn't know whether an increasing

180
00:14:21,660 --> 00:14:26,340
mass and radius would speed up the earth's rotation slow it down or keep it

181
00:14:26,340 --> 00:14:33,180
the same now this is very basic physics on any rotating body either extra mass

182
00:14:33,180 --> 00:14:37,980
or an increasing radius or a combination of both would slow down the

183
00:14:37,980 --> 00:14:42,900
rotational speed and because it's a law of physics once again it's governed by a

184
00:14:42,900 --> 00:14:47,980
mathematical equation so increasing the mass and radius of the earth would make

185
00:14:47,980 --> 00:14:53,900
an earth day longer so here's a tip if you're going to invent a new science and

186
00:14:53,900 --> 00:14:58,060
claim to have all the answers then at least try to familiarize yourself with

187
00:14:58,060 --> 00:15:04,380
the physical laws you claim to accept or reject ok I do sympathize with Neil if

188
00:15:04,380 --> 00:15:08,500
you don't understand scientific explanations for natural phenomena then

189
00:15:08,500 --> 00:15:15,860
of course they must seem like magic in the past people attributed these natural

190
00:15:15,860 --> 00:15:21,540
phenomena to God's goddesses and spirits in this post religious age if they don't

191
00:15:21,540 --> 00:15:25,660
accept the scientific explanations they seek answers in conspiracies

192
00:15:28,060 --> 00:15:34,020
what the heck is in our oxygen supply that create a rainbow effect in a

193
00:15:34,020 --> 00:15:37,900
sprinkler one of the most common things I read on my channel are posts from

194
00:15:37,900 --> 00:15:42,340
people who say they like my videos debunking religious belief but don't

195
00:15:42,340 --> 00:15:46,900
agree with my debunking of whatever it is they believe but the point I'm making

196
00:15:46,900 --> 00:15:50,780
is that if you're going to reject or cherry-pick science to support your

197
00:15:50,780 --> 00:15:55,260
beliefs then it doesn't matter whether those beliefs are religious ideological

198
00:15:55,260 --> 00:16:00,420
humanitarian or anything else you're changing reality to fit your conclusions

199
00:16:00,420 --> 00:16:05,860
that's the exact opposite of science the answer to things we don't understand

200
00:16:05,860 --> 00:16:10,220
isn't to assume that scientists must be conspiring against us but to accept that

201
00:16:10,220 --> 00:16:14,220
we don't understand it take a tip from Clint Eastwood got to know his

202
00:16:14,220 --> 00:16:18,540
limitations so instead of making assertions like dinosaurs could not have

203
00:16:18,540 --> 00:16:22,860
lived on an earth this size put it in the form of a question what do

204
00:16:22,860 --> 00:16:27,580
researchers say allowed dinosaurs to live on an earth this size find out what

205
00:16:27,580 --> 00:16:32,180
it is the researchers know that you don't instead of claiming that the earth

206
00:16:32,180 --> 00:16:36,980
is cooling because ice sheets have increased 60% one year put this in the

207
00:16:36,980 --> 00:16:41,300
form of a question why do researchers still insist that ice sheets are

208
00:16:41,300 --> 00:16:46,380
shrinking in other words instead of assuming a conspiracy find out what it

209
00:16:46,380 --> 00:16:51,940
is they know that you don't sometimes they do ask questions but end up

210
00:16:51,940 --> 00:16:56,180
completely ignoring the answer for example a lot of people asked how the

211
00:16:56,180 --> 00:17:01,420
oldest oceanic crust is much younger than the oldest continental crust this

212
00:17:01,420 --> 00:17:05,980
is something I explained in the video the answer is that oceanic plates are

213
00:17:05,980 --> 00:17:12,140
continuously being created and subducted while continental plates aren't and once

214
00:17:12,140 --> 00:17:15,980
you've asked the question and seen the answer that researchers have laid out in

215
00:17:15,980 --> 00:17:20,260
research journals and textbooks and been shown the measurements and the evidence

216
00:17:20,260 --> 00:17:25,380
don't hide behind scientific conspiracy crap simply because you don't want to

217
00:17:25,380 --> 00:17:30,020
change your beliefs I don't care if you're an atheist an agnostic or the

218
00:17:30,020 --> 00:17:35,740
sugarplum fairy that's no different to religious belief some people wonder why

219
00:17:35,740 --> 00:17:40,860
I bother trying to correct all these idiotic fantasies does it matter yes

220
00:17:40,860 --> 00:17:45,980
science is the foundation of our modern technological society and you should be

221
00:17:45,980 --> 00:17:49,620
worried that an increasing number of people are not only dropping out of

222
00:17:49,820 --> 00:17:53,740
science subjects in school they're turning to whacked-out nonsense based on

223
00:17:53,740 --> 00:17:57,980
the idea that science is all a conspiracy as more people distrust

224
00:17:57,980 --> 00:18:01,420
science they're failing to vaccinate their children we're seeing a

225
00:18:01,420 --> 00:18:06,020
re-emergence of diseases that science had eradicated if governments based

226
00:18:06,020 --> 00:18:11,020
their decisions on superstitions and beliefs rather than on hard science then

227
00:18:11,020 --> 00:18:15,460
we're going to suffer the consequences you know Johannes Kepler spent five

228
00:18:15,460 --> 00:18:20,420
years going through thousands of pieces of observational data to work out how

229
00:18:20,420 --> 00:18:24,500
the planets orbit the Sun he would have given his right arm to have known the

230
00:18:24,500 --> 00:18:29,140
answer we have the luxury of being able to learn about planetary orbits at the

231
00:18:29,140 --> 00:18:34,220
click of a button and we're too lazy or stupid or too uninquiring to do it

232
00:18:34,220 --> 00:18:39,900
instead we'd rather make something up now I've been a bit harsh in this video

233
00:18:39,900 --> 00:18:44,980
so if I've embarrassed anyone or made them look stupid good you should feel

234
00:18:45,020 --> 00:18:49,540
embarrassed you deserve to be laughed at because your brand of stupidity is

235
00:18:49,540 --> 00:18:54,180
dangerous and don't bother telling me how arrogant I am for calling all these

236
00:18:54,180 --> 00:18:58,820
conspiracy theorists stupid because I'm always happy to admit that I'm stupid

237
00:18:58,820 --> 00:19:04,140
too this is one of the few things Neil Adams got right nothing wrong with being

238
00:19:04,140 --> 00:19:08,340
too stupid to understand the kind of science that PhD physicists understand

239
00:19:08,340 --> 00:19:12,420
that's the case not just for me but for ninety nine point nine percent of the

240
00:19:12,460 --> 00:19:17,660
population the difference is I accept that I'm too stupid to understand it so

241
00:19:17,660 --> 00:19:21,340
when something in science doesn't make sense to me I don't assume it's because

242
00:19:21,340 --> 00:19:25,660
scientists are incompetent or devious I either try to find out what it is I

243
00:19:25,660 --> 00:19:30,300
don't understand or if I'm too stupid to wrap my head around it which is often

244
00:19:30,300 --> 00:19:34,180
the case then I follow the Clint Eastwood philosophy and accept my

245
00:19:34,180 --> 00:19:38,940
limitations I don't go bounding off to create my own version of science light

246
00:19:38,940 --> 00:19:42,660
which is science based on belief without the need for any complicated

247
00:19:42,660 --> 00:19:46,140
mathematical equations

248
00:19:46,140 --> 00:19:52,420
he can go for a whole year he can go for a whole year on one grain of rice Neil

249
00:19:52,420 --> 00:19:56,180
Adams has done more to bring the fact of Earth's expansion to millions of people

250
00:19:56,180 --> 00:20:00,860
than anyone oh god another armchair scientist still posting in support of

251
00:20:00,860 --> 00:20:04,980
this crap we have no place in official accepted science thankfully that gives

252
00:20:05,020 --> 00:20:09,220
us the freedom to state our beliefs and theories we're not paid to tow I think

253
00:20:09,220 --> 00:20:14,100
he means tow the line by any university or government agency well if scientific

254
00:20:14,100 --> 00:20:17,660
discoveries at universities and scientific institutions are all

255
00:20:17,660 --> 00:20:23,460
conspiracy-led crap then why bother with it to away with science class in school

256
00:20:23,460 --> 00:20:28,180
and science degrees and scientific research let's all sit in armchairs and

257
00:20:28,180 --> 00:20:32,140
make up theories and put our beliefs into chat rooms and videos and the

258
00:20:32,140 --> 00:20:36,500
belief or theory with the most number of likes gets to be true long live free

259
00:20:36,500 --> 00:20:40,500
thinkers oh is that what you are presumably free from the constraint of

260
00:20:40,500 --> 00:20:45,180
having to make your conclusion fit observations or use math or have your

261
00:20:45,180 --> 00:20:50,780
work fact-checked yeah sounds groovy the problem is while you attack those who

262
00:20:50,780 --> 00:20:54,980
did stay awake in science class and did take the time to study and get degrees

263
00:20:54,980 --> 00:20:59,640
and spend years doing painstaking research for a pittance you have the

264
00:20:59,640 --> 00:21:04,240
gall to use the technology they've created to do it with when you use a

265
00:21:04,240 --> 00:21:07,920
computer to write your comments and blogs you're using a machine that

266
00:21:07,920 --> 00:21:12,320
depends on Ohm's law and Kirchhoff's law when you phone your friends to tell them

267
00:21:12,320 --> 00:21:16,840
Newton's law of universal gravitation is wrong you're using satellite technology

268
00:21:16,840 --> 00:21:20,920
that depends on Newton's law of gravitation to get that message through

269
00:21:20,920 --> 00:21:25,920
when you start your stupid car to attend your stupid meeting with other stupid

270
00:21:25,920 --> 00:21:30,720
new-age flat hollow growing sponge cake earth delusionist nut jobs your starter

271
00:21:30,720 --> 00:21:35,160
motor depends on Faraday's law and the oil it runs on was found using Snell's

272
00:21:35,160 --> 00:21:39,720
law and the engine depends on the laws of thermodynamics so the next time a

273
00:21:39,720 --> 00:21:43,360
stupid thought bubble enters your head and you feel like telling the rest of

274
00:21:43,360 --> 00:21:48,640
the world about it just stop and do what I do if my stupid thought is at odds

275
00:21:48,640 --> 00:21:53,360
with known and accepted science and physical laws then I have only three

276
00:21:53,440 --> 00:21:58,080
options and you know what they are either scientists are all incompetent or

277
00:21:58,080 --> 00:22:03,520
they're all in on a conspiracy or they know something I don't and I need to

278
00:22:03,520 --> 00:22:10,120
find out what that is hint try option three first
