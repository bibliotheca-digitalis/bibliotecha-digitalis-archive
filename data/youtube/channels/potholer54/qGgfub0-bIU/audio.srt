1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Thank you.

2
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
Thank you.

3
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
Thank you.

4
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,000
Are we talking about something that might literally

5
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,000
crack the Earth apart?

6
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,000
What?

7
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,000
No, no, calm down. This isn't really

8
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:40,000
another earthquake prophecy. It's only

9
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,000
little me. When I did my video

10
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,000
last month on the spurious 188

11
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,000
day earthquake cycle,

12
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,000
you know, the one that conveniently left out

13
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,000
dozens of earthquakes that didn't fit,

14
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,000
I asked any statisticians out there

15
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,000
if they could cherry pick other patterns

16
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,000
among the hundreds of randomly generated

17
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,000
numbers that make up the intervals

18
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,000
between earthquakes. And two

19
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,000
of you stepped up to the mark.

20
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,000
My thanks to Oblivion Calling, who polished

21
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,000
up my average earthquake interval and says

22
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,000
it's 17.5 days, not

23
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,000
19, with a standard deviation

24
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:12,000
of 18.7. And

25
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,000
Princip Hoffnung, who looked at all the

26
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,000
time intervals between major quakes and

27
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,000
found this 242

28
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,000
day cycle. Now if any of the

29
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,000
earthquake profits had got hold of it, I'm sure

30
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,000
they would have latched onto it, because

31
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,000
as my fake promotion rightly

32
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,000
says, it's been going on for a lot

33
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,000
longer than the 188 day cycle

34
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,000
and it has more earthquakes in it.

35
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,000
So what do all these magical

36
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,000
cycle believers say now?

37
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,000
We all die. I thank God for this life.

38
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,000
See you in heaven. No, it's OK.

39
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,000
It's not real. I'm trying

40
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,000
to show you that if you have hundreds of

41
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:46,000
randomly generated numbers, then by the

42
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,000
law of averages, you're obviously going to get

43
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,000
lots of four chain numbers that are the same

44
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,000
and a few five or six chain

45
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,000
numbers that are the same. I just

46
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,000
heard this for the first time and I think you're definitely

47
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,000
right. The weather has been very strange

48
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,000
lately. And you know how it talks about how we'll

49
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,000
get to the point where you won't even know what season

50
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,000
it is with the change in the weather? I could see it hitting

51
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,000
the Madrid fault line. I hope not,

52
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,000
but I always remember the work that was done on the dam

53
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,000
near the line. So has anyone ever

54
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,000
had dreams of the coming? I have multiple times

55
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,000
and it was so realistic I thought I was in heaven.

56
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,000
Look, I'm not trying to prophesise something

57
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,000
here. I'm trying to show you that this is rubbish.

58
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,000
Stop looking at me as if

59
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,000
I'm some kind of a messiah of the mega-quakes.

60
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,000
Tell them, Mum.

61
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,000
He's not the messiah. He's a very naughty boy.

62
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,000
That's right.

63
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,000
You don't have to follow me in this fictitious

64
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,000
242 day cycle.

65
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,000
You don't have to follow anyone

66
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,000
just because he finds a pattern that's nothing more

67
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,000
than a statistical exercise.

68
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,000
You've got to learn to think for yourselves.

69
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,000
You're all individuals.

70
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,000
Yes, we're all individuals.

71
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,000
No, I mean it. This isn't a Monty Python

72
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,000
sketch. You're all different.

73
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,000
Yes, we are all

74
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,000
different. I'm not.

75
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,000
Look, all of you, just find some

76
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,000
randomly generated numbers and do the

77
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:58,000
maths yourselves.

78
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,000
I've had a lot of these mathematically

79
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,000
challenged followers coming onto the

80
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,000
comments forum of my video insisting

81
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:06,000
that I must somehow be wrong

82
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,000
but they can't figure out why.

83
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,000
You look a little silly now.

84
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,000
The 188 day cycle predicted a

85
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,000
major quake, March 19th to 22nd

86
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,000
and I'm sure the earthquake in Mexico

87
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,000
had nothing to do with it.

88
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,000
No, because as I showed in my video

89
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,000
large earthquakes happen on average

90
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,000
every 19 days, or as oblivion

91
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,000
calling corrects me, about every 18

92
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,000
days. If you don't believe me, work

93
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,000
it out for yourselves.

94
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,000
So not only does this show there

95
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:34,000
is no 188 day

96
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:36,000
or 242 day cycle

97
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,000
unless you ignore most

98
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,000
earthquakes, I said that because

99
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:42,000
they happen so frequently there's a very good

100
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,000
chance there'd be an earthquake during that

101
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:46,000
three day spread. And there was.

102
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:48,000
What are the odds?

103
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,000
Well, obviously one in 18

104
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:52,000
divided by three, or about one in six.

105
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,000
Getting an earthquake on one of

106
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,000
those three days was like rolling a die

107
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,000
and betting on a six.

108
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,000
It's not rocket science, as

109
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,000
this professor of diceography

110
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,000
will show.

111
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:18,000
If you look good like this, you

112
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,000
don't have to bend down like this.

113
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:22,000
Find the corner, shake that

114
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,000
die really good, like this.

115
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,000
And then roll that dough.

116
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,000
What do I got?

117
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:30,000
I got one and six. Oh,

118
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,000
jump dog, I win. The only ones

119
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:34,000
who look silly are those who wet their pants

120
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,000
thinking they'd witnessed something mysterious

121
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,000
just because a six came up.

122
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:40,000
Because the odds

123
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:42,000
are so good, coming up with a sequence

124
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,000
of several earthquakes is remarkably

125
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,000
easy. Let's take any two

126
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,000
big earthquakes as our starting point.

127
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,000
The time in between is 136

128
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:52,000
days. So what

129
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,000
are the chances of getting another earthquake

130
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:56,000
136 days later?

131
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,000
One in six, of course. And the

132
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,000
chances of getting two more earthquakes

133
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,000
that time interval apart are one

134
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:04,000
in 36. The chances

135
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:06,000
of getting three more earthquakes, one in

136
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:08,000
216.

137
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,000
But of course you can go in either direction

138
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:12,000
and halve the odds, or split

139
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:14,000
the time interval up and decrease them even

140
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:16,000
more. Even if the odds

141
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:18,000
are pretty long, remember there are hundreds

142
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:20,000
of time intervals over the period we're looking

143
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:22,000
at. So the odds of finding one or two

144
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:24,000
strings of five equally separated

145
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:26,000
earthquakes are extremely good.

146
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:28,000
In fact, I'd bet on it.

147
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:30,000
I hate it when people are so closed minded.

148
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:32,000
Well, I'd say closing your mind

149
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:34,000
means only looking at the evidence that

150
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:36,000
fits your pet theory. You'd be

151
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:38,000
surprised at what you find if you open your mind

152
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:40,000
and look at all the evidence.

153
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:42,000
Lucas 911, that's

154
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,000
Wayne Young, did not make money on the DVD.

155
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,000
He posted them free. Videos

156
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:48,000
are free. Yeah, my mistake.

157
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:50,000
It's probably my inability to

158
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:52,000
read that led me to believe his website

159
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:54,000
said the videos were $9.99

160
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:56,000
plus $1.99 US

161
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:58,000
shipping. Well hang on, it did.

162
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:00,000
And here's a recurring theme

163
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,000
from Wayne himself.

164
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:04,000
If I ever do

165
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:06,000
want to take the time to debunk your video,

166
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:08,000
I assure you, I'll watch it.

167
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:10,000
I was debunking your premise

168
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:12,000
that there's a 188 day

169
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:14,000
earthquake cycle. If there's no cycle,

170
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:16,000
then whatever you want to put in the

171
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:18,000
video that might be the cause of it

172
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:20,000
is completely irrelevant.

173
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:22,000
You should let people make up their own minds. We're not

174
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:24,000
idiots. No, I'm not saying

175
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:26,000
you're not allowed to make up

176
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:28,000
your own minds. You can make up

177
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:30,000
your own mind that the chances of rolling a

178
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:32,000
six are one in a thousand.

179
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:34,000
But that doesn't change the mathematics.

180
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:36,000
The odds still cling stubbornly to

181
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:38,000
one in six, whatever your mind

182
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:40,000
has decided. There's nothing

183
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:42,000
wrong with checking what Wayne Young has

184
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:44,000
told you to see if he's correct

185
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:46,000
or checking what I've said to see if I'm

186
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:48,000
right. Nothing wrong with opening a

187
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:50,000
maths textbook or taking an evening

188
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:52,000
course in statistics before

189
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:54,000
you start latching onto what someone's told you

190
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:56,000

191
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:58,000
