0	2000	Thank you.
30000	32000	Thank you.
60000	62000	Thank you.
90000	92000	Are we talking about something that might literally
92000	94000	crack the Earth apart?
94000	96000	What?
96000	98000	No, no, calm down. This isn't really
98000	100000	another earthquake prophecy. It's only
100000	102000	little me. When I did my video
102000	104000	last month on the spurious 188
104000	106000	day earthquake cycle,
106000	108000	you know, the one that conveniently left out
108000	110000	dozens of earthquakes that didn't fit,
110000	112000	I asked any statisticians out there
112000	114000	if they could cherry pick other patterns
114000	116000	among the hundreds of randomly generated
116000	118000	numbers that make up the intervals
118000	120000	between earthquakes. And two
120000	122000	of you stepped up to the mark.
122000	124000	My thanks to Oblivion Calling, who polished
124000	126000	up my average earthquake interval and says
126000	128000	it's 17.5 days, not
128000	130000	19, with a standard deviation
130000	132000	of 18.7. And
132000	134000	Princip Hoffnung, who looked at all the
134000	136000	time intervals between major quakes and
136000	138000	found this 242
138000	140000	day cycle. Now if any of the
140000	142000	earthquake profits had got hold of it, I'm sure
142000	144000	they would have latched onto it, because
144000	146000	as my fake promotion rightly
146000	148000	says, it's been going on for a lot
148000	150000	longer than the 188 day cycle
150000	152000	and it has more earthquakes in it.
152000	154000	So what do all these magical
154000	156000	cycle believers say now?
156000	158000	We all die. I thank God for this life.
158000	160000	See you in heaven. No, it's OK.
160000	162000	It's not real. I'm trying
162000	164000	to show you that if you have hundreds of
164000	166000	randomly generated numbers, then by the
166000	168000	law of averages, you're obviously going to get
168000	170000	lots of four chain numbers that are the same
170000	172000	and a few five or six chain
172000	174000	numbers that are the same. I just
174000	176000	heard this for the first time and I think you're definitely
176000	178000	right. The weather has been very strange
178000	180000	lately. And you know how it talks about how we'll
180000	182000	get to the point where you won't even know what season
182000	184000	it is with the change in the weather? I could see it hitting
184000	186000	the Madrid fault line. I hope not,
186000	188000	but I always remember the work that was done on the dam
188000	190000	near the line. So has anyone ever
190000	192000	had dreams of the coming? I have multiple times
192000	194000	and it was so realistic I thought I was in heaven.
194000	196000	Look, I'm not trying to prophesise something
196000	198000	here. I'm trying to show you that this is rubbish.
198000	200000	Stop looking at me as if
200000	202000	I'm some kind of a messiah of the mega-quakes.
202000	204000	Tell them, Mum.
204000	206000	He's not the messiah. He's a very naughty boy.
206000	208000	That's right.
208000	210000	You don't have to follow me in this fictitious
210000	212000	242 day cycle.
212000	214000	You don't have to follow anyone
214000	216000	just because he finds a pattern that's nothing more
216000	218000	than a statistical exercise.
218000	220000	You've got to learn to think for yourselves.
220000	222000	You're all individuals.
222000	224000	Yes, we're all individuals.
224000	226000	No, I mean it. This isn't a Monty Python
226000	228000	sketch. You're all different.
228000	230000	Yes, we are all
230000	232000	different. I'm not.
232000	234000	Look, all of you, just find some
234000	236000	randomly generated numbers and do the
236000	238000	maths yourselves.
238000	240000	I've had a lot of these mathematically
240000	242000	challenged followers coming onto the
242000	244000	comments forum of my video insisting
244000	246000	that I must somehow be wrong
246000	248000	but they can't figure out why.
248000	250000	You look a little silly now.
250000	252000	The 188 day cycle predicted a
252000	254000	major quake, March 19th to 22nd
254000	256000	and I'm sure the earthquake in Mexico
256000	258000	had nothing to do with it.
258000	260000	No, because as I showed in my video
260000	262000	large earthquakes happen on average
262000	264000	every 19 days, or as oblivion
264000	266000	calling corrects me, about every 18
266000	268000	days. If you don't believe me, work
268000	270000	it out for yourselves.
270000	272000	So not only does this show there
272000	274000	is no 188 day
274000	276000	or 242 day cycle
276000	278000	unless you ignore most
278000	280000	earthquakes, I said that because
280000	282000	they happen so frequently there's a very good
282000	284000	chance there'd be an earthquake during that
284000	286000	three day spread. And there was.
286000	288000	What are the odds?
288000	290000	Well, obviously one in 18
290000	292000	divided by three, or about one in six.
292000	294000	Getting an earthquake on one of
294000	296000	those three days was like rolling a die
296000	298000	and betting on a six.
298000	300000	It's not rocket science, as
300000	302000	this professor of diceography
302000	304000	will show.
316000	318000	If you look good like this, you
318000	320000	don't have to bend down like this.
320000	322000	Find the corner, shake that
322000	324000	die really good, like this.
324000	326000	And then roll that dough.
326000	328000	What do I got?
328000	330000	I got one and six. Oh,
330000	332000	jump dog, I win. The only ones
332000	334000	who look silly are those who wet their pants
334000	336000	thinking they'd witnessed something mysterious
336000	338000	just because a six came up.
338000	340000	Because the odds
340000	342000	are so good, coming up with a sequence
342000	344000	of several earthquakes is remarkably
344000	346000	easy. Let's take any two
346000	348000	big earthquakes as our starting point.
348000	350000	The time in between is 136
350000	352000	days. So what
352000	354000	are the chances of getting another earthquake
354000	356000	136 days later?
356000	358000	One in six, of course. And the
358000	360000	chances of getting two more earthquakes
360000	362000	that time interval apart are one
362000	364000	in 36. The chances
364000	366000	of getting three more earthquakes, one in
366000	368000	216.
368000	370000	But of course you can go in either direction
370000	372000	and halve the odds, or split
372000	374000	the time interval up and decrease them even
374000	376000	more. Even if the odds
376000	378000	are pretty long, remember there are hundreds
378000	380000	of time intervals over the period we're looking
380000	382000	at. So the odds of finding one or two
382000	384000	strings of five equally separated
384000	386000	earthquakes are extremely good.
386000	388000	In fact, I'd bet on it.
388000	390000	I hate it when people are so closed minded.
390000	392000	Well, I'd say closing your mind
392000	394000	means only looking at the evidence that
394000	396000	fits your pet theory. You'd be
396000	398000	surprised at what you find if you open your mind
398000	400000	and look at all the evidence.
400000	402000	Lucas 911, that's
402000	404000	Wayne Young, did not make money on the DVD.
404000	406000	He posted them free. Videos
406000	408000	are free. Yeah, my mistake.
408000	410000	It's probably my inability to
410000	412000	read that led me to believe his website
412000	414000	said the videos were $9.99
414000	416000	plus $1.99 US
416000	418000	shipping. Well hang on, it did.
418000	420000	And here's a recurring theme
420000	422000	from Wayne himself.
422000	424000	If I ever do
424000	426000	want to take the time to debunk your video,
426000	428000	I assure you, I'll watch it.
428000	430000	I was debunking your premise
430000	432000	that there's a 188 day
432000	434000	earthquake cycle. If there's no cycle,
434000	436000	then whatever you want to put in the
436000	438000	video that might be the cause of it
438000	440000	is completely irrelevant.
440000	442000	You should let people make up their own minds. We're not
442000	444000	idiots. No, I'm not saying
444000	446000	you're not allowed to make up
446000	448000	your own minds. You can make up
448000	450000	your own mind that the chances of rolling a
450000	452000	six are one in a thousand.
452000	454000	But that doesn't change the mathematics.
454000	456000	The odds still cling stubbornly to
456000	458000	one in six, whatever your mind
458000	460000	has decided. There's nothing
460000	462000	wrong with checking what Wayne Young has
462000	464000	told you to see if he's correct
464000	466000	or checking what I've said to see if I'm
466000	468000	right. Nothing wrong with opening a
468000	470000	maths textbook or taking an evening
470000	472000	course in statistics before
472000	474000	you start latching onto what someone's told you
474000	476000	and treating it as the gospel truth.
476000	478000	You got to know how to camp. You win.
