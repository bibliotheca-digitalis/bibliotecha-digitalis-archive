WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:02.000
Thank you.

00:30.000 --> 00:32.000
Thank you.

01:00.000 --> 01:02.000
Thank you.

01:30.000 --> 01:32.000
Are we talking about something that might literally

01:32.000 --> 01:34.000
crack the Earth apart?

01:34.000 --> 01:36.000
What?

01:36.000 --> 01:38.000
No, no, calm down. This isn't really

01:38.000 --> 01:40.000
another earthquake prophecy. It's only

01:40.000 --> 01:42.000
little me. When I did my video

01:42.000 --> 01:44.000
last month on the spurious 188

01:44.000 --> 01:46.000
day earthquake cycle,

01:46.000 --> 01:48.000
you know, the one that conveniently left out

01:48.000 --> 01:50.000
dozens of earthquakes that didn't fit,

01:50.000 --> 01:52.000
I asked any statisticians out there

01:52.000 --> 01:54.000
if they could cherry pick other patterns

01:54.000 --> 01:56.000
among the hundreds of randomly generated

01:56.000 --> 01:58.000
numbers that make up the intervals

01:58.000 --> 02:00.000
between earthquakes. And two

02:00.000 --> 02:02.000
of you stepped up to the mark.

02:02.000 --> 02:04.000
My thanks to Oblivion Calling, who polished

02:04.000 --> 02:06.000
up my average earthquake interval and says

02:06.000 --> 02:08.000
it's 17.5 days, not

02:08.000 --> 02:10.000
19, with a standard deviation

02:10.000 --> 02:12.000
of 18.7. And

02:12.000 --> 02:14.000
Princip Hoffnung, who looked at all the

02:14.000 --> 02:16.000
time intervals between major quakes and

02:16.000 --> 02:18.000
found this 242

02:18.000 --> 02:20.000
day cycle. Now if any of the

02:20.000 --> 02:22.000
earthquake profits had got hold of it, I'm sure

02:22.000 --> 02:24.000
they would have latched onto it, because

02:24.000 --> 02:26.000
as my fake promotion rightly

02:26.000 --> 02:28.000
says, it's been going on for a lot

02:28.000 --> 02:30.000
longer than the 188 day cycle

02:30.000 --> 02:32.000
and it has more earthquakes in it.

02:32.000 --> 02:34.000
So what do all these magical

02:34.000 --> 02:36.000
cycle believers say now?

02:36.000 --> 02:38.000
We all die. I thank God for this life.

02:38.000 --> 02:40.000
See you in heaven. No, it's OK.

02:40.000 --> 02:42.000
It's not real. I'm trying

02:42.000 --> 02:44.000
to show you that if you have hundreds of

02:44.000 --> 02:46.000
randomly generated numbers, then by the

02:46.000 --> 02:48.000
law of averages, you're obviously going to get

02:48.000 --> 02:50.000
lots of four chain numbers that are the same

02:50.000 --> 02:52.000
and a few five or six chain

02:52.000 --> 02:54.000
numbers that are the same. I just

02:54.000 --> 02:56.000
heard this for the first time and I think you're definitely

02:56.000 --> 02:58.000
right. The weather has been very strange

02:58.000 --> 03:00.000
lately. And you know how it talks about how we'll

03:00.000 --> 03:02.000
get to the point where you won't even know what season

03:02.000 --> 03:04.000
it is with the change in the weather? I could see it hitting

03:04.000 --> 03:06.000
the Madrid fault line. I hope not,

03:06.000 --> 03:08.000
but I always remember the work that was done on the dam

03:08.000 --> 03:10.000
near the line. So has anyone ever

03:10.000 --> 03:12.000
had dreams of the coming? I have multiple times

03:12.000 --> 03:14.000
and it was so realistic I thought I was in heaven.

03:14.000 --> 03:16.000
Look, I'm not trying to prophesise something

03:16.000 --> 03:18.000
here. I'm trying to show you that this is rubbish.

03:18.000 --> 03:20.000
Stop looking at me as if

03:20.000 --> 03:22.000
I'm some kind of a messiah of the mega-quakes.

03:22.000 --> 03:24.000
Tell them, Mum.

03:24.000 --> 03:26.000
He's not the messiah. He's a very naughty boy.

03:26.000 --> 03:28.000
That's right.

03:28.000 --> 03:30.000
You don't have to follow me in this fictitious

03:30.000 --> 03:32.000
242 day cycle.

03:32.000 --> 03:34.000
You don't have to follow anyone

03:34.000 --> 03:36.000
just because he finds a pattern that's nothing more

03:36.000 --> 03:38.000
than a statistical exercise.

03:38.000 --> 03:40.000
You've got to learn to think for yourselves.

03:40.000 --> 03:42.000
You're all individuals.

03:42.000 --> 03:44.000
Yes, we're all individuals.

03:44.000 --> 03:46.000
No, I mean it. This isn't a Monty Python

03:46.000 --> 03:48.000
sketch. You're all different.

03:48.000 --> 03:50.000
Yes, we are all

03:50.000 --> 03:52.000
different. I'm not.

03:52.000 --> 03:54.000
Look, all of you, just find some

03:54.000 --> 03:56.000
randomly generated numbers and do the

03:56.000 --> 03:58.000
maths yourselves.

03:58.000 --> 04:00.000
I've had a lot of these mathematically

04:00.000 --> 04:02.000
challenged followers coming onto the

04:02.000 --> 04:04.000
comments forum of my video insisting

04:04.000 --> 04:06.000
that I must somehow be wrong

04:06.000 --> 04:08.000
but they can't figure out why.

04:08.000 --> 04:10.000
You look a little silly now.

04:10.000 --> 04:12.000
The 188 day cycle predicted a

04:12.000 --> 04:14.000
major quake, March 19th to 22nd

04:14.000 --> 04:16.000
and I'm sure the earthquake in Mexico

04:16.000 --> 04:18.000
had nothing to do with it.

04:18.000 --> 04:20.000
No, because as I showed in my video

04:20.000 --> 04:22.000
large earthquakes happen on average

04:22.000 --> 04:24.000
every 19 days, or as oblivion

04:24.000 --> 04:26.000
calling corrects me, about every 18

04:26.000 --> 04:28.000
days. If you don't believe me, work

04:28.000 --> 04:30.000
it out for yourselves.

04:30.000 --> 04:32.000
So not only does this show there

04:32.000 --> 04:34.000
is no 188 day

04:34.000 --> 04:36.000
or 242 day cycle

04:36.000 --> 04:38.000
unless you ignore most

04:38.000 --> 04:40.000
earthquakes, I said that because

04:40.000 --> 04:42.000
they happen so frequently there's a very good

04:42.000 --> 04:44.000
chance there'd be an earthquake during that

04:44.000 --> 04:46.000
three day spread. And there was.

04:46.000 --> 04:48.000
What are the odds?

04:48.000 --> 04:50.000
Well, obviously one in 18

04:50.000 --> 04:52.000
divided by three, or about one in six.

04:52.000 --> 04:54.000
Getting an earthquake on one of

04:54.000 --> 04:56.000
those three days was like rolling a die

04:56.000 --> 04:58.000
and betting on a six.

04:58.000 --> 05:00.000
It's not rocket science, as

05:00.000 --> 05:02.000
this professor of diceography

05:02.000 --> 05:04.000
will show.

05:16.000 --> 05:18.000
If you look good like this, you

05:18.000 --> 05:20.000
don't have to bend down like this.

05:20.000 --> 05:22.000
Find the corner, shake that

05:22.000 --> 05:24.000
die really good, like this.

05:24.000 --> 05:26.000
And then roll that dough.

05:26.000 --> 05:28.000
What do I got?

05:28.000 --> 05:30.000
I got one and six. Oh,

05:30.000 --> 05:32.000
jump dog, I win. The only ones

05:32.000 --> 05:34.000
who look silly are those who wet their pants

05:34.000 --> 05:36.000
thinking they'd witnessed something mysterious

05:36.000 --> 05:38.000
just because a six came up.

05:38.000 --> 05:40.000
Because the odds

05:40.000 --> 05:42.000
are so good, coming up with a sequence

05:42.000 --> 05:44.000
of several earthquakes is remarkably

05:44.000 --> 05:46.000
easy. Let's take any two

05:46.000 --> 05:48.000
big earthquakes as our starting point.

05:48.000 --> 05:50.000
The time in between is 136

05:50.000 --> 05:52.000
days. So what

05:52.000 --> 05:54.000
are the chances of getting another earthquake

05:54.000 --> 05:56.000
136 days later?

05:56.000 --> 05:58.000
One in six, of course. And the

05:58.000 --> 06:00.000
chances of getting two more earthquakes

06:00.000 --> 06:02.000
that time interval apart are one

06:02.000 --> 06:04.000
in 36. The chances

06:04.000 --> 06:06.000
of getting three more earthquakes, one in

06:06.000 --> 06:08.000
216.

06:08.000 --> 06:10.000
But of course you can go in either direction

06:10.000 --> 06:12.000
and halve the odds, or split

06:12.000 --> 06:14.000
the time interval up and decrease them even

06:14.000 --> 06:16.000
more. Even if the odds

06:16.000 --> 06:18.000
are pretty long, remember there are hundreds

06:18.000 --> 06:20.000
of time intervals over the period we're looking

06:20.000 --> 06:22.000
at. So the odds of finding one or two

06:22.000 --> 06:24.000
strings of five equally separated

06:24.000 --> 06:26.000
earthquakes are extremely good.

06:26.000 --> 06:28.000
In fact, I'd bet on it.

06:28.000 --> 06:30.000
I hate it when people are so closed minded.

06:30.000 --> 06:32.000
Well, I'd say closing your mind

06:32.000 --> 06:34.000
means only looking at the evidence that

06:34.000 --> 06:36.000
fits your pet theory. You'd be

06:36.000 --> 06:38.000
surprised at what you find if you open your mind

06:38.000 --> 06:40.000
and look at all the evidence.

06:40.000 --> 06:42.000
Lucas 911, that's

06:42.000 --> 06:44.000
Wayne Young, did not make money on the DVD.

06:44.000 --> 06:46.000
He posted them free. Videos

06:46.000 --> 06:48.000
are free. Yeah, my mistake.

06:48.000 --> 06:50.000
It's probably my inability to

06:50.000 --> 06:52.000
read that led me to believe his website

06:52.000 --> 06:54.000
said the videos were $9.99

06:54.000 --> 06:56.000
plus $1.99 US

06:56.000 --> 06:58.000
shipping. Well hang on, it did.

06:58.000 --> 07:00.000
And here's a recurring theme

07:00.000 --> 07:02.000
from Wayne himself.

07:02.000 --> 07:04.000
If I ever do

07:04.000 --> 07:06.000
want to take the time to debunk your video,

07:06.000 --> 07:08.000
I assure you, I'll watch it.

07:08.000 --> 07:10.000
I was debunking your premise

07:10.000 --> 07:12.000
that there's a 188 day

07:12.000 --> 07:14.000
earthquake cycle. If there's no cycle,

07:14.000 --> 07:16.000
then whatever you want to put in the

07:16.000 --> 07:18.000
video that might be the cause of it

07:18.000 --> 07:20.000
is completely irrelevant.

07:20.000 --> 07:22.000
You should let people make up their own minds. We're not

07:22.000 --> 07:24.000
idiots. No, I'm not saying

07:24.000 --> 07:26.000
you're not allowed to make up

07:26.000 --> 07:28.000
your own minds. You can make up

07:28.000 --> 07:30.000
your own mind that the chances of rolling a

07:30.000 --> 07:32.000
six are one in a thousand.

07:32.000 --> 07:34.000
But that doesn't change the mathematics.

07:34.000 --> 07:36.000
The odds still cling stubbornly to

07:36.000 --> 07:38.000
one in six, whatever your mind

07:38.000 --> 07:40.000
has decided. There's nothing

07:40.000 --> 07:42.000
wrong with checking what Wayne Young has

07:42.000 --> 07:44.000
told you to see if he's correct

07:44.000 --> 07:46.000
or checking what I've said to see if I'm

07:46.000 --> 07:48.000
right. Nothing wrong with opening a

07:48.000 --> 07:50.000
maths textbook or taking an evening

07:50.000 --> 07:52.000
course in statistics before

07:52.000 --> 07:54.000
you start latching onto what someone's told you

07:54.000 --> 07:56.000
and treating it as the gospel truth.

07:56.000 --> 07:58.000
You got to know how to camp. You win.
