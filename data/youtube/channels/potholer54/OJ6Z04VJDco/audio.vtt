00:00.000 --> 00:11.000
There is no evidence that past CO2 rise, current CO2 rise, or future CO2 rise has caused, is

00:11.000 --> 00:14.000
causing, or will cause global warming.

00:14.000 --> 00:19.000
I don't believe in man-made climate change because there is no evidence for it.

00:19.000 --> 00:25.000
There is no evidence at all from Earth's long climate history that carbon dioxide has ever

00:25.000 --> 00:27.000
determined global temperatures.

00:27.000 --> 00:31.000
I can understand trying to find flaws in the evidence that supports a theory or putting

00:31.000 --> 00:36.000
up evidence to counter it, but to counter the thousands of pages of data published in

00:36.000 --> 00:42.000
hundreds of scientific journals by simply doing this, well, it's a bit weak to say the

00:42.000 --> 00:43.000
least.

00:43.000 --> 00:47.000
And claiming that all the evidence comes from computer models isn't much better.

00:47.000 --> 00:55.000
All of the alarm over CO2 was generated by speculative projections inside a questionable

00:56.000 --> 00:57.000
computer program.

00:57.000 --> 01:01.000
To find the evidence you have to get away from the blogs, they're not going to show

01:01.000 --> 01:06.000
it, and look at the place where the research is written up, in scientific journals.

01:06.000 --> 01:11.000
So in this video I'm going to show the evidence that's in the scientific literature,

01:11.000 --> 01:16.000
explained in very simple terms and answering just three key questions.

01:16.000 --> 01:19.000
What's the evidence that CO2 can cause global warming?

01:19.000 --> 01:22.000
What's the evidence that it's done that in the past?

01:22.000 --> 01:25.000
And what's the evidence that it's doing that now?

01:25.000 --> 01:31.000
And I promise no computer models are necessary and no references at all to the IPCC.

01:31.000 --> 01:37.000
That's because, contrary to popular belief, the evidence is not reliant on computer models

01:37.000 --> 01:42.000
and none of the research that answers these questions has been conducted by the IPCC.

01:42.000 --> 01:44.000
So let's start with the first question.

01:44.000 --> 01:48.000
What's the evidence that CO2 can cause global warming?

01:48.000 --> 01:51.000
In other words, the theory behind it all.

01:51.000 --> 01:55.000
I covered this in more detail in the first video of this series, so I'm going to keep

01:55.000 --> 01:56.000
it simple.

01:56.000 --> 02:01.000
It was way back in the 19th century that physicists discovered that carbon dioxide lets through

02:01.000 --> 02:07.000
short wavelength light, the kind that passes through our atmosphere, but traps longer wavelength

02:07.000 --> 02:11.000
heat radiation of the kind that would be reflected back into space.

02:11.000 --> 02:16.000
This experiment was done and can still be done in a laboratory.

02:16.000 --> 02:22.000
In 1896, Vante Arrhenius calculated that based on this simple principle of physics, higher

02:22.000 --> 02:28.000
levels of CO2 in the atmosphere would therefore block more outgoing radiation and that would

02:28.000 --> 02:30.000
raise global temperatures.

02:30.000 --> 02:36.000
In the 1930s, Guy Stewart Callender showed that the radiation absorbed by CO2 was at

02:36.000 --> 02:42.000
different wavelengths to the radiation absorbed by another important greenhouse gas, water vapour.

02:42.000 --> 02:49.000
By the 1950s and 60s, rising CO2 levels suggested that a much warmer world would soon be inevitable.

02:49.000 --> 02:54.000
Due to our release through factories and automobiles every year of more than 6 billion tonnes of

02:54.000 --> 03:00.000
carbon dioxide, which helps air absorb heat from the sun, our atmosphere seems to be getting

03:00.000 --> 03:01.000
warmer.

03:01.000 --> 03:03.000
This is bad.

03:03.000 --> 03:10.000
Well, it's been calculated a few degrees rise in the Earth's temperature would melt the polar ice caps.

03:10.000 --> 03:14.000
I know, the script for this school education film looks like something that could have

03:14.000 --> 03:16.000
been made in 2008.

03:16.000 --> 03:22.000
In fact, it was made in 1958 and it was based on the scientific conclusions of the time,

03:22.000 --> 03:25.000
conclusions that haven't changed.

03:25.000 --> 03:30.000
So that dispels the myth that the global warming scare, if you want to call it that, was dreamed

03:30.000 --> 03:34.000
up by Al Gore or the IPCC or the Club of Rome.

03:34.000 --> 03:36.000
It predates them all.

03:36.000 --> 03:42.000
Climatologists not only know that CO2 blocks outgoing heat through experiment, but they can also

03:42.000 --> 03:44.000
measure exactly how much.

03:44.000 --> 03:49.000
That's how they know that a doubling of CO2 from pre-industrial levels will lead to a rise in

03:49.000 --> 03:53.000
average global temperatures of about one degree centigrade.

03:53.000 --> 03:58.000
And all climate scientists accept the fact that water vapour is also a greenhouse gas.

03:58.000 --> 04:03.000
Again, this is basic physics, shown by experiment and measurable.

04:03.000 --> 04:08.000
The difference between water vapour and carbon dioxide is that when you put water vapour into the

04:08.000 --> 04:10.000
atmosphere, it doesn't stay there very long.

04:10.000 --> 04:16.000
The atmosphere can only hold so much water vapour at a given temperature and any excess condenses

04:16.000 --> 04:18.000
and falls to the ground.

04:18.000 --> 04:23.000
Even if you manage to turn all the Earth's lakes and rivers into water vapour in a single day,

04:23.000 --> 04:27.000
it would simply condense and come crashing back to Earth.

04:27.000 --> 04:32.000
The only way to get the atmosphere to hold more water vapour is to warm it up.

04:32.000 --> 04:35.000
And that's what carbon dioxide does.

04:35.000 --> 04:39.000
When CO2 is put into the air, it doesn't fall straight back down again.

04:39.000 --> 04:44.000
About half of it dissolves in water and half stays in the atmosphere.

04:44.000 --> 04:45.000
It accumulates.

04:45.000 --> 04:50.000
That's why CO2 concentrations in the atmosphere have been steadily rising since the start of the

04:50.000 --> 04:53.000
Industrial Revolution 200 years ago.

04:53.000 --> 04:59.000
So, CO2 warms the atmosphere and a warmer atmosphere holds more water vapour,

04:59.000 --> 05:02.000
which increases temperatures further.

05:02.000 --> 05:07.000
The basic laws of physics tell us that the Earth will heat up in response to this extra energy

05:07.000 --> 05:12.000
and the temperature will keep rising until the increased amount of energy radiated out

05:12.000 --> 05:16.000
matches the amount coming in, what's called equilibrium.

05:16.000 --> 05:20.000
The temperature will eventually stabilise at a higher level.

05:20.000 --> 05:22.000
What will that higher level be?

05:22.000 --> 05:27.000
Well, you can estimate it with computer models, sure, but you can also do it through other methods,

05:27.000 --> 05:30.000
including looking back at the effects CO2 had in the past.

05:30.000 --> 05:34.000
And these estimates show that for a doubling of CO2 concentrations,

05:34.000 --> 05:39.000
we should see a rise in global temperatures of between 2 and 4.5 degrees.

05:39.000 --> 05:43.000
Now that's all basic physics, but to see if this happens in practice,

05:43.000 --> 05:47.000
we need to go back over the geological record and answer the second question,

05:47.000 --> 05:52.000
what's the evidence CO2 has had an impact on global temperatures in the past?

05:52.000 --> 05:56.000
If basic physics is correct, then we should see a good correlation

05:56.000 --> 06:00.000
between temperatures and CO2 over the past 500 million years.

06:00.000 --> 06:05.000
Well, here's the data for temperatures and here's the data for CO2 levels.

06:05.000 --> 06:09.000
Put them together and you get a very clear, oh dear.

06:09.000 --> 06:12.000
Actually, no one expected to see a correlation between the two

06:12.000 --> 06:17.000
because of course we're missing the most important factor of them all, the Sun.

06:17.000 --> 06:21.000
Well, they virtually ignore the Sun as a factor of climate change.

06:21.000 --> 06:24.000
I mean, everybody knows that the Sun is the main source of energy

06:24.000 --> 06:27.000
and it's only got a flicker and it has an effect on us.

06:27.000 --> 06:30.000
Tim Ball thinks he's talking about researchers here,

06:30.000 --> 06:35.000
but it's the climate science critics, the politicians, the bloggers and the amateurs,

06:35.000 --> 06:39.000
who showcase this graph that completely ignores the role of the Sun

06:39.000 --> 06:43.000
and it's the climate researchers who factor it in.

06:43.000 --> 06:48.000
Over the last 500 million years, solar output has been getting gradually stronger.

06:48.000 --> 06:52.000
Of course, on its own, it doesn't show any better correlation with global temperatures

06:52.000 --> 06:55.000
than carbon dioxide does on its own.

06:55.000 --> 06:58.000
But if the CO2 temperature link is correct,

06:58.000 --> 07:02.000
then when we factor in both CO2 and solar irradiance,

07:02.000 --> 07:04.000
which are the long-term drivers of climate,

07:04.000 --> 07:09.000
then we should get a very good correlation with global temperatures and we do.

07:09.000 --> 07:15.000
And a third piece of evidence from our geological past are the so-called Snowball Earth conditions

07:15.000 --> 07:19.000
Since the Sun was much weaker than today during the Precambrian period,

07:19.000 --> 07:25.000
the cooled Earth should have been almost entirely covered in ice and it was several times.

07:25.000 --> 07:27.000
So what thawed it out?

07:27.000 --> 07:29.000
The only thing that changed during the Snowball period

07:29.000 --> 07:34.000
was that CO2 levels rose dramatically through volcanic activity.

07:34.000 --> 07:40.000
The thawing of the planet fits perfectly with carbon dioxide's role as a powerful greenhouse gas.

07:40.000 --> 07:45.000
Over time, CO2 tends to get washed out of the atmosphere due to chemical weathering,

07:45.000 --> 07:50.000
becoming carbonates that fall to the sea floor and turn into carbonate rocks.

07:50.000 --> 07:55.000
But during Snowball Earth, for obvious reasons, that kind of weathering didn't happen,

07:55.000 --> 07:58.000
which is why CO2 would have accumulated in the atmosphere.

07:58.000 --> 08:02.000
And since those high levels of CO2 remained even after the Earth had thawed,

08:02.000 --> 08:08.000
the Earth kept warming until it became a hot house with coral reefs close to the poles.

08:08.000 --> 08:12.000
Yes, even with the Sun about 6% weaker than it is today,

08:12.000 --> 08:18.000
but with carbon dioxide levels 25 times higher, the Earth was much hotter than today.

08:18.000 --> 08:25.000
This anomaly is our fourth piece of evidence that carbon dioxide is a powerful greenhouse gas.

08:25.000 --> 08:29.000
Over millions of years, carbon dioxide weathered out of the atmosphere

08:29.000 --> 08:31.000
and as levels dropped, so did the temperature.

08:31.000 --> 08:36.000
The Earth became a snowball once again and the process repeated itself.

08:36.000 --> 08:40.000
Carbon dioxide's role in regulating past temperature is so clear

08:40.000 --> 08:44.000
that CO2 has been called the Earth's thermostat.

08:44.000 --> 08:49.000
So when I hear the argument, the climate's always changed and this is perfectly natural,

08:49.000 --> 08:54.000
and that the climate change going on now is perfectly natural, well, of course it is.

08:54.000 --> 08:59.000
There's absolutely no difference between the CO2 that's being added to the atmosphere now

08:59.000 --> 09:03.000
and the CO2 that was added to the atmosphere in the past.

09:03.000 --> 09:09.000
It's the same stuff and its warming effect on the atmosphere is exactly the same.

09:09.000 --> 09:11.000
Coming to the more recent past,

09:11.000 --> 09:16.000
there's the evidence that higher levels of carbon dioxide helped end recent glaciations.

09:16.000 --> 09:20.000
Climatologists agree that the amount of forcing from the Earth's changing orbit,

09:20.000 --> 09:23.000
thought to be the initial trigger for deglaciation,

09:23.000 --> 09:28.000
had nowhere near enough energy to thaw ice covering a large portion of the planet.

09:28.000 --> 09:32.000
I covered this in my video, The 800 Year Lag Unraveled.

09:32.000 --> 09:36.000
So before you start claiming that CO2 only lags temperature changes,

09:36.000 --> 09:41.000
please take a look at the scientific research that I cite in that video.

09:41.000 --> 09:47.000
So we've now seen how basic physics tells us that increasing levels of CO2 should warm the Earth,

09:47.000 --> 09:52.000
and we've seen that this has been observed throughout the Phanerozoic, the last 500 million years,

09:52.000 --> 09:56.000
and we've seen how a hot house Earth and a thawing of a frozen Earth

09:56.000 --> 10:00.000
are consistent with CO2 as a powerful greenhouse gas.

10:00.000 --> 10:04.000
So if it should happen in theory, and it has happened in practice,

10:04.000 --> 10:09.000
then there's no reason to suppose CO2 has reformed its behaviour

10:09.000 --> 10:14.000
just because it comes from the burning of fossil fuels rather than volcanic activity.

10:14.000 --> 10:19.000
So is there any evidence that CO2 is causing global warming now?

10:19.000 --> 10:27.000
Back in the 1950s, 60s and 70s, of course, scientists saw no reason why CO2 should magically change its properties,

10:27.000 --> 10:34.000
and they predicted that as CO2 levels rose and aerosol pollution cleared, we'd start to see warming.

10:34.000 --> 10:37.000
And that's exactly what's happened.

10:37.000 --> 10:43.000
Over the last 35 years, the atmosphere has been warming, melting ice sheets and glaciers.

10:43.000 --> 10:47.000
Of course, not all the extra heat we're getting goes into the atmosphere.

10:47.000 --> 10:52.000
Most of it goes into the ocean, and recent research shows that the deep oceans

10:52.000 --> 10:55.000
are absorbing a lot of the heat at the expense of the atmosphere.

10:55.000 --> 11:01.000
So while there's still a debate among climatologists about exactly how this extra heat is being distributed,

11:01.000 --> 11:07.000
there's no doubt that there is extra heat coming into the system, just as scientists predicted.

11:07.000 --> 11:10.000
So where do the computer models come in?

11:10.000 --> 11:15.000
As I said, they weren't even around when the link between CO2 and global temperature was established.

11:15.000 --> 11:22.000
Most of the computer models I've seen are concerned with predicting the nature and the effects of future temperature rises,

11:22.000 --> 11:26.000
which I'll look at in another video on the consequences of global warming.

11:26.000 --> 11:31.000
But ironically, one part of climate science that's almost entirely reliant on computer models

11:31.000 --> 11:34.000
is a hypothesis that the critics embrace.

11:34.000 --> 11:41.000
Richard Lindsen's idea that as the Earth warms due to CO2, more cloud cover cools the Earth down again.

11:41.000 --> 11:45.000
So the Earth has a self-regulating temperature mechanism.

11:45.000 --> 11:51.000
Apart from the fact that most research shows that clouds have both a cooling and a warming effect,

11:51.000 --> 11:56.000
if there was some kind of self-regulating mechanism that stopped the Earth from overheating,

11:56.000 --> 12:00.000
we wouldn't see those wild swings in temperature in the past.

12:00.000 --> 12:07.000
In 12 minutes, I've only scratched the surface of all the depth of all the evidence that's accumulated over the last 100 years.

12:07.000 --> 12:13.000
But on the three key questions I set out to answer, at least you now know what the basic evidence is,

12:13.000 --> 12:17.000
without reliance on computer models or the IPCC.

12:17.000 --> 12:22.000
So to all those who don't accept the science, please don't respond with more predictable posts

12:22.000 --> 12:28.000
about how it's all an IPCC hoax, an attack scam, and computer models are wrong.

12:28.000 --> 12:32.000
Or that this all started with the Club of Rome or Al Gore and they're all getting rich.

12:32.000 --> 12:35.000
Try to address the evidence.

12:35.000 --> 12:40.000
Explain why you think the experiments showing the radiation absorption of CO2 are flawed.

12:40.000 --> 12:44.000
And explain how the Earth thawed from its pre-Cambrian snowball.

12:44.000 --> 12:50.000
Explain why the Earth was much hotter than today during the Cambrian, even though solar output was much lower.

12:50.000 --> 12:57.000
And explain why there's a very good correlation between global temperatures and CO2 levels over the last 500 million years.

12:57.000 --> 13:01.000
And explain how the Earth warmed enough to emerge from recent glaciations.

13:01.000 --> 13:07.000
And explain why we've had 35 years of warming, even though solar irradiation has been lower.

13:07.000 --> 13:13.000
It's no good giving your feeling that CO2 isn't responsible, or that it's all a hoax, or Al Gore's getting rich,

13:13.000 --> 13:20.000
or CO2 always lags temperature change but never leads, or God is looking after the climate, or the sun did it.

13:20.000 --> 13:27.000
Making assertions is easy, but in science they have to be based on observations, not guesswork.

13:27.000 --> 13:34.000
You'll find a list of these internet myths in the video description and reference as to where I've debunked them in previous videos.

13:34.000 --> 13:36.000
So take a look there first.

13:36.000 --> 13:42.000
But this inevitable question deserves an answer now, because it goes to the heart of what constitutes evidence.

13:42.000 --> 13:48.000
I explained the meaning of evidence in a scientific context in my video, The Scientific Method Made Easy,

13:48.000 --> 13:53.000
and it's applied to all scientific theories, including greenhouse theory.

13:53.000 --> 14:00.000
Evidence is an observation, otherwise known in science as a fact, that's consistent with the theory.

14:00.000 --> 14:04.000
The more observations that are consistent, the stronger the theory becomes.

14:04.000 --> 14:13.000
It's a bit like a jigsaw puzzle. Each piece of evidence in itself won't tell you much, but as more evidence is gathered, a picture emerges.

14:13.000 --> 14:20.000
Eventually someone will produce a hypothesis as to what the picture is, and make a prediction that here, we'll see an eye.

14:20.000 --> 14:25.000
A successful prediction is the key to turning a hypothesis into a theory.

14:25.000 --> 14:31.000
Eventually there'll be what's called an overwhelming preponderance of evidence supporting the theory,

14:31.000 --> 14:37.000
and another key test, no rival hypothesis even comes close to explaining all these observations.

14:37.000 --> 14:43.000
With just one or two pieces, you could hypothesise that the picture is a fire or a swan,

14:43.000 --> 14:48.000
but as more and more evidence comes in, it can only match one theory.

14:48.000 --> 14:54.000
Now of course there are still a lot of unknowns and problems and unanswered questions in greenhouse theory,

14:54.000 --> 14:59.000
just as there are in all scientific theories, because that's the nature of science.

14:59.000 --> 15:05.000
So just as with the theory of evolution, atomic theory, plate tectonic theory, and all the other theories,

15:05.000 --> 15:11.000
we have observations that fit the theory, and the theory fits nearly all our observations.

15:11.000 --> 15:17.000
To overturn a theory, you have to address the evidence, not just pretend it doesn't exist.

15:17.000 --> 15:24.000
OK, 50 years ago you could have done that, because while there was certainly evidence that CO2 had the potential to warm our planet,

15:25.000 --> 15:31.000
and that was very clear, there was not yet the evidence that it had done that in the past, or was doing it at the time.

15:31.000 --> 15:36.000
These predictions were based on carbon dioxide's basic energy absorbing properties,

15:36.000 --> 15:42.000
and a calculation without computer models of what the obvious consequences of these properties would be.

15:42.000 --> 15:48.000
Of course no one outside the scientific community took this seriously back in the 1950s.

15:48.000 --> 15:53.000
I guess the researchers of the time figured that people of the future would only take the science seriously

15:53.000 --> 15:59.000
when the ice really was melting, and the glaciers really were retreating. That's us.
