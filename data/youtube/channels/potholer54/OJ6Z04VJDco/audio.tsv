0	11000	There is no evidence that past CO2 rise, current CO2 rise, or future CO2 rise has caused, is
11000	14000	causing, or will cause global warming.
14000	19000	I don't believe in man-made climate change because there is no evidence for it.
19000	25000	There is no evidence at all from Earth's long climate history that carbon dioxide has ever
25000	27000	determined global temperatures.
27000	31000	I can understand trying to find flaws in the evidence that supports a theory or putting
31000	36000	up evidence to counter it, but to counter the thousands of pages of data published in
36000	42000	hundreds of scientific journals by simply doing this, well, it's a bit weak to say the
42000	43000	least.
43000	47000	And claiming that all the evidence comes from computer models isn't much better.
47000	55000	All of the alarm over CO2 was generated by speculative projections inside a questionable
56000	57000	computer program.
57000	61000	To find the evidence you have to get away from the blogs, they're not going to show
61000	66000	it, and look at the place where the research is written up, in scientific journals.
66000	71000	So in this video I'm going to show the evidence that's in the scientific literature,
71000	76000	explained in very simple terms and answering just three key questions.
76000	79000	What's the evidence that CO2 can cause global warming?
79000	82000	What's the evidence that it's done that in the past?
82000	85000	And what's the evidence that it's doing that now?
85000	91000	And I promise no computer models are necessary and no references at all to the IPCC.
91000	97000	That's because, contrary to popular belief, the evidence is not reliant on computer models
97000	102000	and none of the research that answers these questions has been conducted by the IPCC.
102000	104000	So let's start with the first question.
104000	108000	What's the evidence that CO2 can cause global warming?
108000	111000	In other words, the theory behind it all.
111000	115000	I covered this in more detail in the first video of this series, so I'm going to keep
115000	116000	it simple.
116000	121000	It was way back in the 19th century that physicists discovered that carbon dioxide lets through
121000	127000	short wavelength light, the kind that passes through our atmosphere, but traps longer wavelength
127000	131000	heat radiation of the kind that would be reflected back into space.
131000	136000	This experiment was done and can still be done in a laboratory.
136000	142000	In 1896, Vante Arrhenius calculated that based on this simple principle of physics, higher
142000	148000	levels of CO2 in the atmosphere would therefore block more outgoing radiation and that would
148000	150000	raise global temperatures.
150000	156000	In the 1930s, Guy Stewart Callender showed that the radiation absorbed by CO2 was at
156000	162000	different wavelengths to the radiation absorbed by another important greenhouse gas, water vapour.
162000	169000	By the 1950s and 60s, rising CO2 levels suggested that a much warmer world would soon be inevitable.
169000	174000	Due to our release through factories and automobiles every year of more than 6 billion tonnes of
174000	180000	carbon dioxide, which helps air absorb heat from the sun, our atmosphere seems to be getting
180000	181000	warmer.
181000	183000	This is bad.
183000	190000	Well, it's been calculated a few degrees rise in the Earth's temperature would melt the polar ice caps.
190000	194000	I know, the script for this school education film looks like something that could have
194000	196000	been made in 2008.
196000	202000	In fact, it was made in 1958 and it was based on the scientific conclusions of the time,
202000	205000	conclusions that haven't changed.
205000	210000	So that dispels the myth that the global warming scare, if you want to call it that, was dreamed
210000	214000	up by Al Gore or the IPCC or the Club of Rome.
214000	216000	It predates them all.
216000	222000	Climatologists not only know that CO2 blocks outgoing heat through experiment, but they can also
222000	224000	measure exactly how much.
224000	229000	That's how they know that a doubling of CO2 from pre-industrial levels will lead to a rise in
229000	233000	average global temperatures of about one degree centigrade.
233000	238000	And all climate scientists accept the fact that water vapour is also a greenhouse gas.
238000	243000	Again, this is basic physics, shown by experiment and measurable.
243000	248000	The difference between water vapour and carbon dioxide is that when you put water vapour into the
248000	250000	atmosphere, it doesn't stay there very long.
250000	256000	The atmosphere can only hold so much water vapour at a given temperature and any excess condenses
256000	258000	and falls to the ground.
258000	263000	Even if you manage to turn all the Earth's lakes and rivers into water vapour in a single day,
263000	267000	it would simply condense and come crashing back to Earth.
267000	272000	The only way to get the atmosphere to hold more water vapour is to warm it up.
272000	275000	And that's what carbon dioxide does.
275000	279000	When CO2 is put into the air, it doesn't fall straight back down again.
279000	284000	About half of it dissolves in water and half stays in the atmosphere.
284000	285000	It accumulates.
285000	290000	That's why CO2 concentrations in the atmosphere have been steadily rising since the start of the
290000	293000	Industrial Revolution 200 years ago.
293000	299000	So, CO2 warms the atmosphere and a warmer atmosphere holds more water vapour,
299000	302000	which increases temperatures further.
302000	307000	The basic laws of physics tell us that the Earth will heat up in response to this extra energy
307000	312000	and the temperature will keep rising until the increased amount of energy radiated out
312000	316000	matches the amount coming in, what's called equilibrium.
316000	320000	The temperature will eventually stabilise at a higher level.
320000	322000	What will that higher level be?
322000	327000	Well, you can estimate it with computer models, sure, but you can also do it through other methods,
327000	330000	including looking back at the effects CO2 had in the past.
330000	334000	And these estimates show that for a doubling of CO2 concentrations,
334000	339000	we should see a rise in global temperatures of between 2 and 4.5 degrees.
339000	343000	Now that's all basic physics, but to see if this happens in practice,
343000	347000	we need to go back over the geological record and answer the second question,
347000	352000	what's the evidence CO2 has had an impact on global temperatures in the past?
352000	356000	If basic physics is correct, then we should see a good correlation
356000	360000	between temperatures and CO2 over the past 500 million years.
360000	365000	Well, here's the data for temperatures and here's the data for CO2 levels.
365000	369000	Put them together and you get a very clear, oh dear.
369000	372000	Actually, no one expected to see a correlation between the two
372000	377000	because of course we're missing the most important factor of them all, the Sun.
377000	381000	Well, they virtually ignore the Sun as a factor of climate change.
381000	384000	I mean, everybody knows that the Sun is the main source of energy
384000	387000	and it's only got a flicker and it has an effect on us.
387000	390000	Tim Ball thinks he's talking about researchers here,
390000	395000	but it's the climate science critics, the politicians, the bloggers and the amateurs,
395000	399000	who showcase this graph that completely ignores the role of the Sun
399000	403000	and it's the climate researchers who factor it in.
403000	408000	Over the last 500 million years, solar output has been getting gradually stronger.
408000	412000	Of course, on its own, it doesn't show any better correlation with global temperatures
412000	415000	than carbon dioxide does on its own.
415000	418000	But if the CO2 temperature link is correct,
418000	422000	then when we factor in both CO2 and solar irradiance,
422000	424000	which are the long-term drivers of climate,
424000	429000	then we should get a very good correlation with global temperatures and we do.
429000	435000	And a third piece of evidence from our geological past are the so-called Snowball Earth conditions
435000	439000	Since the Sun was much weaker than today during the Precambrian period,
439000	445000	the cooled Earth should have been almost entirely covered in ice and it was several times.
445000	447000	So what thawed it out?
447000	449000	The only thing that changed during the Snowball period
449000	454000	was that CO2 levels rose dramatically through volcanic activity.
454000	460000	The thawing of the planet fits perfectly with carbon dioxide's role as a powerful greenhouse gas.
460000	465000	Over time, CO2 tends to get washed out of the atmosphere due to chemical weathering,
465000	470000	becoming carbonates that fall to the sea floor and turn into carbonate rocks.
470000	475000	But during Snowball Earth, for obvious reasons, that kind of weathering didn't happen,
475000	478000	which is why CO2 would have accumulated in the atmosphere.
478000	482000	And since those high levels of CO2 remained even after the Earth had thawed,
482000	488000	the Earth kept warming until it became a hot house with coral reefs close to the poles.
488000	492000	Yes, even with the Sun about 6% weaker than it is today,
492000	498000	but with carbon dioxide levels 25 times higher, the Earth was much hotter than today.
498000	505000	This anomaly is our fourth piece of evidence that carbon dioxide is a powerful greenhouse gas.
505000	509000	Over millions of years, carbon dioxide weathered out of the atmosphere
509000	511000	and as levels dropped, so did the temperature.
511000	516000	The Earth became a snowball once again and the process repeated itself.
516000	520000	Carbon dioxide's role in regulating past temperature is so clear
520000	524000	that CO2 has been called the Earth's thermostat.
524000	529000	So when I hear the argument, the climate's always changed and this is perfectly natural,
529000	534000	and that the climate change going on now is perfectly natural, well, of course it is.
534000	539000	There's absolutely no difference between the CO2 that's being added to the atmosphere now
539000	543000	and the CO2 that was added to the atmosphere in the past.
543000	549000	It's the same stuff and its warming effect on the atmosphere is exactly the same.
549000	551000	Coming to the more recent past,
551000	556000	there's the evidence that higher levels of carbon dioxide helped end recent glaciations.
556000	560000	Climatologists agree that the amount of forcing from the Earth's changing orbit,
560000	563000	thought to be the initial trigger for deglaciation,
563000	568000	had nowhere near enough energy to thaw ice covering a large portion of the planet.
568000	572000	I covered this in my video, The 800 Year Lag Unraveled.
572000	576000	So before you start claiming that CO2 only lags temperature changes,
576000	581000	please take a look at the scientific research that I cite in that video.
581000	587000	So we've now seen how basic physics tells us that increasing levels of CO2 should warm the Earth,
587000	592000	and we've seen that this has been observed throughout the Phanerozoic, the last 500 million years,
592000	596000	and we've seen how a hot house Earth and a thawing of a frozen Earth
596000	600000	are consistent with CO2 as a powerful greenhouse gas.
600000	604000	So if it should happen in theory, and it has happened in practice,
604000	609000	then there's no reason to suppose CO2 has reformed its behaviour
609000	614000	just because it comes from the burning of fossil fuels rather than volcanic activity.
614000	619000	So is there any evidence that CO2 is causing global warming now?
619000	627000	Back in the 1950s, 60s and 70s, of course, scientists saw no reason why CO2 should magically change its properties,
627000	634000	and they predicted that as CO2 levels rose and aerosol pollution cleared, we'd start to see warming.
634000	637000	And that's exactly what's happened.
637000	643000	Over the last 35 years, the atmosphere has been warming, melting ice sheets and glaciers.
643000	647000	Of course, not all the extra heat we're getting goes into the atmosphere.
647000	652000	Most of it goes into the ocean, and recent research shows that the deep oceans
652000	655000	are absorbing a lot of the heat at the expense of the atmosphere.
655000	661000	So while there's still a debate among climatologists about exactly how this extra heat is being distributed,
661000	667000	there's no doubt that there is extra heat coming into the system, just as scientists predicted.
667000	670000	So where do the computer models come in?
670000	675000	As I said, they weren't even around when the link between CO2 and global temperature was established.
675000	682000	Most of the computer models I've seen are concerned with predicting the nature and the effects of future temperature rises,
682000	686000	which I'll look at in another video on the consequences of global warming.
686000	691000	But ironically, one part of climate science that's almost entirely reliant on computer models
691000	694000	is a hypothesis that the critics embrace.
694000	701000	Richard Lindsen's idea that as the Earth warms due to CO2, more cloud cover cools the Earth down again.
701000	705000	So the Earth has a self-regulating temperature mechanism.
705000	711000	Apart from the fact that most research shows that clouds have both a cooling and a warming effect,
711000	716000	if there was some kind of self-regulating mechanism that stopped the Earth from overheating,
716000	720000	we wouldn't see those wild swings in temperature in the past.
720000	727000	In 12 minutes, I've only scratched the surface of all the depth of all the evidence that's accumulated over the last 100 years.
727000	733000	But on the three key questions I set out to answer, at least you now know what the basic evidence is,
733000	737000	without reliance on computer models or the IPCC.
737000	742000	So to all those who don't accept the science, please don't respond with more predictable posts
742000	748000	about how it's all an IPCC hoax, an attack scam, and computer models are wrong.
748000	752000	Or that this all started with the Club of Rome or Al Gore and they're all getting rich.
752000	755000	Try to address the evidence.
755000	760000	Explain why you think the experiments showing the radiation absorption of CO2 are flawed.
760000	764000	And explain how the Earth thawed from its pre-Cambrian snowball.
764000	770000	Explain why the Earth was much hotter than today during the Cambrian, even though solar output was much lower.
770000	777000	And explain why there's a very good correlation between global temperatures and CO2 levels over the last 500 million years.
777000	781000	And explain how the Earth warmed enough to emerge from recent glaciations.
781000	787000	And explain why we've had 35 years of warming, even though solar irradiation has been lower.
787000	793000	It's no good giving your feeling that CO2 isn't responsible, or that it's all a hoax, or Al Gore's getting rich,
793000	800000	or CO2 always lags temperature change but never leads, or God is looking after the climate, or the sun did it.
800000	807000	Making assertions is easy, but in science they have to be based on observations, not guesswork.
807000	814000	You'll find a list of these internet myths in the video description and reference as to where I've debunked them in previous videos.
814000	816000	So take a look there first.
816000	822000	But this inevitable question deserves an answer now, because it goes to the heart of what constitutes evidence.
822000	828000	I explained the meaning of evidence in a scientific context in my video, The Scientific Method Made Easy,
828000	833000	and it's applied to all scientific theories, including greenhouse theory.
833000	840000	Evidence is an observation, otherwise known in science as a fact, that's consistent with the theory.
840000	844000	The more observations that are consistent, the stronger the theory becomes.
844000	853000	It's a bit like a jigsaw puzzle. Each piece of evidence in itself won't tell you much, but as more evidence is gathered, a picture emerges.
853000	860000	Eventually someone will produce a hypothesis as to what the picture is, and make a prediction that here, we'll see an eye.
860000	865000	A successful prediction is the key to turning a hypothesis into a theory.
865000	871000	Eventually there'll be what's called an overwhelming preponderance of evidence supporting the theory,
871000	877000	and another key test, no rival hypothesis even comes close to explaining all these observations.
877000	883000	With just one or two pieces, you could hypothesise that the picture is a fire or a swan,
883000	888000	but as more and more evidence comes in, it can only match one theory.
888000	894000	Now of course there are still a lot of unknowns and problems and unanswered questions in greenhouse theory,
894000	899000	just as there are in all scientific theories, because that's the nature of science.
899000	905000	So just as with the theory of evolution, atomic theory, plate tectonic theory, and all the other theories,
905000	911000	we have observations that fit the theory, and the theory fits nearly all our observations.
911000	917000	To overturn a theory, you have to address the evidence, not just pretend it doesn't exist.
917000	924000	OK, 50 years ago you could have done that, because while there was certainly evidence that CO2 had the potential to warm our planet,
925000	931000	and that was very clear, there was not yet the evidence that it had done that in the past, or was doing it at the time.
931000	936000	These predictions were based on carbon dioxide's basic energy absorbing properties,
936000	942000	and a calculation without computer models of what the obvious consequences of these properties would be.
942000	948000	Of course no one outside the scientific community took this seriously back in the 1950s.
948000	953000	I guess the researchers of the time figured that people of the future would only take the science seriously
953000	959000	when the ice really was melting, and the glaciers really were retreating. That's us.
