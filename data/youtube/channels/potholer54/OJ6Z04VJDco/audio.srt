1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:11,000
There is no evidence that past CO2 rise, current CO2 rise, or future CO2 rise has caused, is

2
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:14,000
causing, or will cause global warming.

3
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:19,000
I don't believe in man-made climate change because there is no evidence for it.

4
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:25,000
There is no evidence at all from Earth's long climate history that carbon dioxide has ever

5
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:27,000
determined global temperatures.

6
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:31,000
I can understand trying to find flaws in the evidence that supports a theory or putting

7
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:36,000
up evidence to counter it, but to counter the thousands of pages of data published in

8
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:42,000
hundreds of scientific journals by simply doing this, well, it's a bit weak to say the

9
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:43,000
least.

10
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:47,000
And claiming that all the evidence comes from computer models isn't much better.

11
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:55,000
All of the alarm over CO2 was generated by speculative projections inside a questionable

12
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:57,000
computer program.

13
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:01,000
To find the evidence you have to get away from the blogs, they're not going to show

14
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:06,000
it, and look at the place where the research is written up, in scientific journals.

15
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:11,000
So in this video I'm going to show the evidence that's in the scientific literature,

16
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:16,000
explained in very simple terms and answering just three key questions.

17
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:19,000
What's the evidence that CO2 can cause global warming?

18
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:22,000
What's the evidence that it's done that in the past?

19
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:25,000
And what's the evidence that it's doing that now?

20
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:31,000
And I promise no computer models are necessary and no references at all to the IPCC.

21
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:37,000
That's because, contrary to popular belief, the evidence is not reliant on computer models

22
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:42,000
and none of the research that answers these questions has been conducted by the IPCC.

23
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,000
So let's start with the first question.

24
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:48,000
What's the evidence that CO2 can cause global warming?

25
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:51,000
In other words, the theory behind it all.

26
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:55,000
I covered this in more detail in the first video of this series, so I'm going to keep

27
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:56,000
it simple.

28
00:01:56,000 --> 00:02:01,000
It was way back in the 19th century that physicists discovered that carbon dioxide lets through

29
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:07,000
short wavelength light, the kind that passes through our atmosphere, but traps longer wavelength

30
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:11,000
heat radiation of the kind that would be reflected back into space.

31
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:16,000
This experiment was done and can still be done in a laboratory.

32
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:22,000
In 1896, Vante Arrhenius calculated that based on this simple principle of physics, higher

33
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:28,000
levels of CO2 in the atmosphere would therefore block more outgoing radiation and that would

34
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,000
raise global temperatures.

35
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:36,000
In the 1930s, Guy Stewart Callender showed that the radiation absorbed by CO2 was at

36
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:42,000
different wavelengths to the radiation absorbed by another important greenhouse gas, water vapour.

37
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:49,000
By the 1950s and 60s, rising CO2 levels suggested that a much warmer world would soon be inevitable.

38
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:54,000
Due to our release through factories and automobiles every year of more than 6 billion tonnes of

39
00:02:54,000 --> 00:03:00,000
carbon dioxide, which helps air absorb heat from the sun, our atmosphere seems to be getting

40
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:01,000
warmer.

41
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:03,000
This is bad.

42
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:10,000
Well, it's been calculated a few degrees rise in the Earth's temperature would melt the polar ice caps.

43
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:14,000
I know, the script for this school education film looks like something that could have

44
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,000
been made in 2008.

45
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:22,000
In fact, it was made in 1958 and it was based on the scientific conclusions of the time,

46
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:25,000
conclusions that haven't changed.

47
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:30,000
So that dispels the myth that the global warming scare, if you want to call it that, was dreamed

48
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:34,000
up by Al Gore or the IPCC or the Club of Rome.

49
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,000
It predates them all.

50
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:42,000
Climatologists not only know that CO2 blocks outgoing heat through experiment, but they can also

51
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,000
measure exactly how much.

52
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:49,000
That's how they know that a doubling of CO2 from pre-industrial levels will lead to a rise in

53
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:53,000
average global temperatures of about one degree centigrade.

54
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:58,000
And all climate scientists accept the fact that water vapour is also a greenhouse gas.

55
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:03,000
Again, this is basic physics, shown by experiment and measurable.

56
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:08,000
The difference between water vapour and carbon dioxide is that when you put water vapour into the

57
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,000
atmosphere, it doesn't stay there very long.

58
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:16,000
The atmosphere can only hold so much water vapour at a given temperature and any excess condenses

59
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,000
and falls to the ground.

60
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:23,000
Even if you manage to turn all the Earth's lakes and rivers into water vapour in a single day,

61
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:27,000
it would simply condense and come crashing back to Earth.

62
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:32,000
The only way to get the atmosphere to hold more water vapour is to warm it up.

63
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:35,000
And that's what carbon dioxide does.

64
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:39,000
When CO2 is put into the air, it doesn't fall straight back down again.

65
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:44,000
About half of it dissolves in water and half stays in the atmosphere.

66
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:45,000
It accumulates.

67
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:50,000
That's why CO2 concentrations in the atmosphere have been steadily rising since the start of the

68
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:53,000
Industrial Revolution 200 years ago.

69
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:59,000
So, CO2 warms the atmosphere and a warmer atmosphere holds more water vapour,

70
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:02,000
which increases temperatures further.

71
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:07,000
The basic laws of physics tell us that the Earth will heat up in response to this extra energy

72
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:12,000
and the temperature will keep rising until the increased amount of energy radiated out

73
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:16,000
matches the amount coming in, what's called equilibrium.

74
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:20,000
The temperature will eventually stabilise at a higher level.

75
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:22,000
What will that higher level be?

76
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:27,000
Well, you can estimate it with computer models, sure, but you can also do it through other methods,

77
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:30,000
including looking back at the effects CO2 had in the past.

78
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:34,000
And these estimates show that for a doubling of CO2 concentrations,

79
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:39,000
we should see a rise in global temperatures of between 2 and 4.5 degrees.

80
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:43,000
Now that's all basic physics, but to see if this happens in practice,

81
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:47,000
we need to go back over the geological record and answer the second question,

82
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:52,000
what's the evidence CO2 has had an impact on global temperatures in the past?

83
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:56,000
If basic physics is correct, then we should see a good correlation

84
00:05:56,000 --> 00:06:00,000
between temperatures and CO2 over the past 500 million years.

85
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:05,000
Well, here's the data for temperatures and here's the data for CO2 levels.

86
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:09,000
Put them together and you get a very clear, oh dear.

87
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:12,000
Actually, no one expected to see a correlation between the two

88
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:17,000
because of course we're missing the most important factor of them all, the Sun.

89
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:21,000
Well, they virtually ignore the Sun as a factor of climate change.

90
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:24,000
I mean, everybody knows that the Sun is the main source of energy

91
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:27,000
and it's only got a flicker and it has an effect on us.

92
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:30,000
Tim Ball thinks he's talking about researchers here,

93
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:35,000
but it's the climate science critics, the politicians, the bloggers and the amateurs,

94
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:39,000
who showcase this graph that completely ignores the role of the Sun

95
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:43,000
and it's the climate researchers who factor it in.

96
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:48,000
Over the last 500 million years, solar output has been getting gradually stronger.

97
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:52,000
Of course, on its own, it doesn't show any better correlation with global temperatures

98
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:55,000
than carbon dioxide does on its own.

99
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:58,000
But if the CO2 temperature link is correct,

100
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:02,000
then when we factor in both CO2 and solar irradiance,

101
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:04,000
which are the long-term drivers of climate,

102
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:09,000
then we should get a very good correlation with global temperatures and we do.

103
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:15,000
And a third piece of evidence from our geological past are the so-called Snowball Earth conditions

104
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:19,000
Since the Sun was much weaker than today during the Precambrian period,

105
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:25,000
the cooled Earth should have been almost entirely covered in ice and it was several times.

106
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:27,000
So what thawed it out?

107
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:29,000
The only thing that changed during the Snowball period

108
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:34,000
was that CO2 levels rose dramatically through volcanic activity.

109
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:40,000
The thawing of the planet fits perfectly with carbon dioxide's role as a powerful greenhouse gas.

110
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:45,000
Over time, CO2 tends to get washed out of the atmosphere due to chemical weathering,

111
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:50,000
becoming carbonates that fall to the sea floor and turn into carbonate rocks.

112
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:55,000
But during Snowball Earth, for obvious reasons, that kind of weathering didn't happen,

113
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:58,000
which is why CO2 would have accumulated in the atmosphere.

114
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:02,000
And since those high levels of CO2 remained even after the Earth had thawed,

115
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:08,000
the Earth kept warming until it became a hot house with coral reefs close to the poles.

116
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:12,000
Yes, even with the Sun about 6% weaker than it is today,

117
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:18,000
but with carbon dioxide levels 25 times higher, the Earth was much hotter than today.

118
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:25,000
This anomaly is our fourth piece of evidence that carbon dioxide is a powerful greenhouse gas.

119
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:29,000
Over millions of years, carbon dioxide weathered out of the atmosphere

120
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:31,000
and as levels dropped, so did the temperature.

121
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:36,000
The Earth became a snowball once again and the process repeated itself.

122
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:40,000
Carbon dioxide's role in regulating past temperature is so clear

123
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:44,000
that CO2 has been called the Earth's thermostat.

124
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:49,000
So when I hear the argument, the climate's always changed and this is perfectly natural,

125
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:54,000
and that the climate change going on now is perfectly natural, well, of course it is.

126
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:59,000
There's absolutely no difference between the CO2 that's being added to the atmosphere now

127
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:03,000
and the CO2 that was added to the atmosphere in the past.

128
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:09,000
It's the same stuff and its warming effect on the atmosphere is exactly the same.

129
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:11,000
Coming to the more recent past,

130
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:16,000
there's the evidence that higher levels of carbon dioxide helped end recent glaciations.

131
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:20,000
Climatologists agree that the amount of forcing from the Earth's changing orbit,

132
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:23,000
thought to be the initial trigger for deglaciation,

133
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:28,000
had nowhere near enough energy to thaw ice covering a large portion of the planet.

134
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:32,000
I covered this in my video, The 800 Year Lag Unraveled.

135
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:36,000
So before you start claiming that CO2 only lags temperature changes,

136
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:41,000
please take a look at the scientific research that I cite in that video.

137
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:47,000
So we've now seen how basic physics tells us that increasing levels of CO2 should warm the Earth,

138
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:52,000
and we've seen that this has been observed throughout the Phanerozoic, the last 500 million years,

139
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:56,000
and we've seen how a hot house Earth and a thawing of a frozen Earth

140
00:09:56,000 --> 00:10:00,000
are consistent with CO2 as a powerful greenhouse gas.

141
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:04,000
So if it should happen in theory, and it has happened in practice,

142
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:09,000
then there's no reason to suppose CO2 has reformed its behaviour

143
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:14,000
just because it comes from the burning of fossil fuels rather than volcanic activity.

144
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:19,000
So is there any evidence that CO2 is causing global warming now?

145
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:27,000
Back in the 1950s, 60s and 70s, of course, scientists saw no reason why CO2 should magically change its properties,

146
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:34,000
and they predicted that as CO2 levels rose and aerosol pollution cleared, we'd start to see warming.

147
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:37,000
And that's exactly what's happened.

148
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:43,000
Over the last 35 years, the atmosphere has been warming, melting ice sheets and glaciers.

149
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:47,000
Of course, not all the extra heat we're getting goes into the atmosphere.

150
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:52,000
Most of it goes into the ocean, and recent research shows that the deep oceans

151
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:55,000
are absorbing a lot of the heat at the expense of the atmosphere.

152
00:10:55,000 --> 00:11:01,000
So while there's still a debate among climatologists about exactly how this extra heat is being distributed,

153
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:07,000
there's no doubt that there is extra heat coming into the system, just as scientists predicted.

154
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:10,000
So where do the computer models come in?

155
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:15,000
As I said, they weren't even around when the link between CO2 and global temperature was established.

156
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:22,000
Most of the computer models I've seen are concerned with predicting the nature and the effects of future temperature rises,

157
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:26,000
which I'll look at in another video on the consequences of global warming.

158
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:31,000
But ironically, one part of climate science that's almost entirely reliant on computer models

159
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:34,000
is a hypothesis that the critics embrace.

160
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:41,000
Richard Lindsen's idea that as the Earth warms due to CO2, more cloud cover cools the Earth down again.

161
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:45,000
So the Earth has a self-regulating temperature mechanism.

162
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:51,000
Apart from the fact that most research shows that clouds have both a cooling and a warming effect,

163
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:56,000
if there was some kind of self-regulating mechanism that stopped the Earth from overheating,

164
00:11:56,000 --> 00:12:00,000
we wouldn't see those wild swings in temperature in the past.

165
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:07,000
In 12 minutes, I've only scratched the surface of all the depth of all the evidence that's accumulated over the last 100 years.

166
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:13,000
But on the three key questions I set out to answer, at least you now know what the basic evidence is,

167
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:17,000
without reliance on computer models or the IPCC.

168
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:22,000
So to all those who don't accept the science, please don't respond with more predictable posts

169
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:28,000
about how it's all an IPCC hoax, an attack scam, and computer models are wrong.

170
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:32,000
Or that this all started with the Club of Rome or Al Gore and they're all getting rich.

171
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:35,000
Try to address the evidence.

172
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:40,000
Explain why you think the experiments showing the radiation absorption of CO2 are flawed.

173
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:44,000
And explain how the Earth thawed from its pre-Cambrian snowball.

174
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:50,000
Explain why the Earth was much hotter than today during the Cambrian, even though solar output was much lower.

175
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:57,000
And explain why there's a very good correlation between global temperatures and CO2 levels over the last 500 million years.

176
00:12:57,000 --> 00:13:01,000
And explain how the Earth warmed enough to emerge from recent glaciations.

177
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:07,000
And explain why we've had 35 years of warming, even though solar irradiation has been lower.

178
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:13,000
It's no good giving your feeling that CO2 isn't responsible, or that it's all a hoax, or Al Gore's getting rich,

179
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:20,000
or CO2 always lags temperature change but never leads, or God is looking after the climate, or the sun did it.

180
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:27,000
Making assertions is easy, but in science they have to be based on observations, not guesswork.

181
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:34,000
You'll find a list of these internet myths in the video description and reference as to where I've debunked them in previous videos.

182
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:36,000
So take a look there first.

183
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:42,000
But this inevitable question deserves an answer now, because it goes to the heart of what constitutes evidence.

184
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:48,000
I explained the meaning of evidence in a scientific context in my video, The Scientific Method Made Easy,

185
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:53,000
and it's applied to all scientific theories, including greenhouse theory.

186
00:13:53,000 --> 00:14:00,000
Evidence is an observation, otherwise known in science as a fact, that's consistent with the theory.

187
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:04,000
The more observations that are consistent, the stronger the theory becomes.

188
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:13,000
It's a bit like a jigsaw puzzle. Each piece of evidence in itself won't tell you much, but as more evidence is gathered, a picture emerges.

189
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:20,000
Eventually someone will produce a hypothesis as to what the picture is, and make a prediction that here, we'll see an eye.

190
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:25,000
A successful prediction is the key to turning a hypothesis into a theory.

191
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:31,000
Eventually there'll be what's called an overwhelming preponderance of evidence supporting the theory,

192
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:37,000
and another key test, no rival hypothesis even comes close to explaining all these observations.

193
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:43,000
With just one or two pieces, you could hypothesise that the picture is a fire or a swan,

194
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:48,000
but as more and more evidence comes in, it can only match one theory.

195
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:54,000
Now of course there are still a lot of unknowns and problems and unanswered questions in greenhouse theory,

196
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:59,000
just as there are in all scientific theories, because that's the nature of science.

197
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:05,000
So just as with the theory of evolution, atomic theory, plate tectonic theory, and all the other theories,

198
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:11,000
we have observations that fit the theory, and the theory fits nearly all our observations.

199
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:17,000
To overturn a theory, you have to address the evidence, not just pretend it doesn't exist.

200
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:24,000
OK, 50 years ago you could have done that, because while there was certainly evidence that CO2 had the potential to warm our planet,

201
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:31,000
and that was very clear, there was not yet the evidence that it had done that in the past, or was doing it at the time.

202
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:36,000
These predictions were based on carbon dioxide's basic energy absorbing properties,

203
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:42,000
and a calculation without computer models of what the obvious consequences of these properties would be.

204
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:48,000
Of course no one outside the scientific community took this seriously back in the 1950s.

205
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:53,000
I guess the researchers of the time figured that people of the future would only take the science seriously

206
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:59,000
when the ice really was melting, and the glaciers really were retreating. That's us.
