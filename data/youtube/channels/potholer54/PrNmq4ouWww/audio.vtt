00:00.800 --> 00:04.160
NASA now says burning fossil fuels cools the planet?

00:05.280 --> 00:08.080
Yes, the question mark and exclamation point are right.

00:08.080 --> 00:08.640
What the f***?

00:09.680 --> 00:13.440
NASA, along with every other major scientific institution in the world,

00:13.440 --> 00:17.200
has been telling us for decades that burning fossil fuels increases

00:17.200 --> 00:19.840
the concentration of CO2 in the atmosphere.

00:19.840 --> 00:26.080
And as scientists have known for over 120 years, an increase of CO2 causes global warming.

00:26.080 --> 00:29.200
And now all of a sudden NASA's telling us it causes cooling?

00:30.000 --> 00:33.680
This fact has been brought to us by my old friend Steve Crowder.

00:33.680 --> 00:37.360
And the only reason I spotted it is because it was above a tweet of his

00:37.360 --> 00:41.600
that someone had told me about, claiming that I'd declined to come on his show.

00:42.240 --> 00:46.640
So before I set the record straight on that, let me deal with this claim first.

00:47.600 --> 00:52.800
Regular subscribers to my channel know exactly what to do when a transparently silly claim like

00:52.800 --> 00:58.320
this hits the blogosphere. Find out where it comes from, trace it right back to its source,

00:58.320 --> 01:03.520
and see how the primary source has been misunderstood or misrepresented along the way.

01:03.520 --> 01:07.200
And in this case starting that trail is as easy as clicking on this link.

01:08.080 --> 01:13.200
It comes from the Sunday Express from over a year earlier.

01:14.080 --> 01:18.800
OK, the next step is to see where the Express got its information from so we can check it.

01:19.600 --> 01:21.360
And it wasn't hard to find out.

01:21.360 --> 01:25.040
I simply googled some of the NASA quotes from the Express story

01:25.040 --> 01:28.320
and it turned out they all came from this NASA press release.

01:28.880 --> 01:34.000
And the source of the NASA press release was this paper which was published in 2015.

01:34.720 --> 01:38.400
People often ask me how to track down sources and that's how it's done.

01:39.040 --> 01:43.120
Now all we have to do is see how the information has changed along the way,

01:43.120 --> 01:47.680
just like the old telephone game, or what we call in the UK, Chinese whispers.

01:48.720 --> 01:53.440
Well, the press release reported the conclusions of the paper accurately, so no change there.

01:54.000 --> 01:58.240
And here's the Express story, with the material copied and pasted verbatim from

01:58.240 --> 02:02.560
the NASA press release highlighted in yellow. So that's all accurate.

02:03.200 --> 02:05.680
What's interesting are the bits in between,

02:05.680 --> 02:10.400
the bits of the press release that for some reason the Express decided to change.

02:11.280 --> 02:12.800
Let's start with the headline.

02:12.800 --> 02:14.960
The title of the NASA paper was

02:14.960 --> 02:18.800
Implications for climate sensitivity from the response to individual forcings.

02:19.440 --> 02:21.680
The NASA press release headline was

02:21.680 --> 02:26.240
NASA study examination of Earth's recent history key to predicting global temperatures.

02:26.960 --> 02:30.160
And let's see what headline the Express decided to run with.

02:30.160 --> 02:34.560
Climate change shock! Burning fossil fuels cools planet, says NASA.

02:35.840 --> 02:38.240
And Crowder echoed the Sunday Express line.

02:38.240 --> 02:41.360
NASA now says burning fossil fuels cools the planet?

02:42.240 --> 02:43.440
Beginning to see the difference?

02:44.080 --> 02:46.640
Let's go to more detail about this alleged cooling.

02:47.360 --> 02:48.400
According to the paper,

02:49.040 --> 02:53.280
Forcings that project more strongly on the northern hemisphere, land or polar regions

02:53.280 --> 02:57.840
are systematically more effective at changing temperatures than an equivalent amount of CO2

02:57.840 --> 03:01.120
whose forcing is more uniformly distributed throughout the globe.

03:02.080 --> 03:03.680
The press release says,

03:03.680 --> 03:07.280
Because earlier studies do not account for what amounts to a net cooling effect

03:07.280 --> 03:09.120
for part of the northern hemisphere,

03:09.120 --> 03:12.720
predictions for TCR and ECS have been lower than they should be.

03:13.600 --> 03:15.840
Now how does the Sunday Express change that?

03:16.400 --> 03:17.200
It goes with,

03:17.200 --> 03:21.200
NASA found a net cooling in the northern hemisphere due to industrial activity.

03:22.080 --> 03:23.360
And Crowder says,

03:23.360 --> 03:27.600
The latest talking point to march to its death, fossil fuels cause global warming,

03:27.600 --> 03:29.040
because they don't!

03:29.040 --> 03:33.120
In fact, NASA says fossil fuels actually cause temporary global cooling.

03:34.560 --> 03:38.880
So we've gone from aerosols causing net cooling in parts of the northern hemisphere

03:39.760 --> 03:42.320
to causing net cooling in the northern hemisphere

03:42.320 --> 03:45.120
to causing temporary cooling across the entire planet.

03:45.760 --> 03:48.960
And from that, let's call it a misunderstanding,

03:48.960 --> 03:52.720
Crowder concludes that fossil fuels don't cause global warming.

03:53.520 --> 03:56.560
If Crowder had checked the tabloid newspaper's source,

03:56.560 --> 03:59.040
instead of simply believing what it said,

03:59.040 --> 04:03.760
he would have discovered the error and not embellished it with completely the wrong conclusion.

04:04.720 --> 04:08.480
What probably confused the Sunday Express and Crowder

04:08.480 --> 04:12.240
is that this may be the first time they've learned that some types of fossil fuels

04:12.240 --> 04:14.160
produce sulfate aerosols,

04:14.160 --> 04:17.840
and that these aerosols reflect sunlight and therefore have a cooling effect.

04:18.560 --> 04:22.080
This was mentioned by NASA because it's what prompted the study,

04:22.080 --> 04:24.960
but of course it wasn't the conclusion of the study.

04:25.840 --> 04:29.440
After all, the cooling effect of aerosols has been known for decades,

04:29.440 --> 04:31.920
and I've even talked about it in my videos.

04:31.920 --> 04:37.360
If you burn high sulfur fossil fuels, you get a lot of sulfate pollution known as aerosols,

04:37.360 --> 04:40.560
and this pollution mitigates the warming effect of CO2.

04:41.120 --> 04:46.240
If you switch to cleaner fuels like natural gas, which doesn't produce so many sulfates,

04:46.240 --> 04:49.280
the aerosols very quickly get washed out of the atmosphere,

04:49.280 --> 04:53.360
the air clears, and you feel the full effects of CO2-induced warming.

04:54.080 --> 04:57.280
Several papers have tried to quantify the effect of aerosols,

04:57.280 --> 05:01.200
and the NASA paper was simply doing that using a more accurate method.

05:01.840 --> 05:07.040
What it found was that previous studies had underestimated the cooling effect of aerosols,

05:07.040 --> 05:10.240
and that means the underlying warming effect of CO2

05:10.240 --> 05:13.760
must be much greater than was previously calculated.

05:13.760 --> 05:15.360
Here's what the NASA study said.

05:16.000 --> 05:19.680
This has been rewritten quite accurately by the press release as,

05:19.680 --> 05:23.200
because earlier studies do not account for what amounts to a net cooling effect

05:23.200 --> 05:25.040
for parts of the northern hemisphere,

05:25.040 --> 05:28.400
predictions for TCR and ECS have been lower than they should be.

05:29.440 --> 05:31.120
The Express changed that to,

05:31.120 --> 05:36.320
existing climate change models have underestimated what the future impact on global temperatures will be.

05:37.120 --> 05:40.320
The Express makes it sound as though other climate models haven't taken

05:40.320 --> 05:42.480
the cooling effect of aerosols into account,

05:42.480 --> 05:46.160
and therefore the Earth is not going to warm as much as we thought.

05:46.160 --> 05:48.720
That's certainly the impression Crowder got.

05:48.720 --> 05:51.920
For years we heard burning fossil fuels caused global warming,

05:51.920 --> 05:55.200
but now they've found that, whoops, no, we meant cooling.

05:56.400 --> 05:59.520
In fact, the NASA paper and the NASA press release

05:59.520 --> 06:02.720
make it clear that their conclusion is the complete opposite.

06:03.280 --> 06:06.800
Burning fossil fuels actually causes more warming than we thought.

06:07.440 --> 06:10.880
I know, again, a lot of Crowder fans will write in

06:10.880 --> 06:14.800
refusing to believe that he could have drawn completely the opposite conclusion

06:14.800 --> 06:17.440
to the conclusion of the NASA study he didn't read.

06:18.080 --> 06:22.160
Well, Crowder always encourages his fans to engage in critical thinking,

06:22.160 --> 06:25.360
so if you don't believe what I'm showing you, that's good.

06:25.360 --> 06:28.240
Do some critical thinking and read the blog,

06:28.800 --> 06:33.360
read the newspaper, the press release, and the study for yourselves.

06:33.360 --> 06:35.520
All my sources are in the video description.

06:36.480 --> 06:40.800
While I was making this video, Crowder posted yet another fallacy on his blog,

06:41.360 --> 06:45.280
and while I was checking and correcting that one, yet another one popped up.

06:46.080 --> 06:48.960
It's hard to keep up, but let's deal with this one first.

06:49.600 --> 06:52.400
Crowder fell for a phony Mail on Sunday story

06:52.400 --> 06:56.160
that claimed a whistleblower had exposed a fiddling of figures by NOAA.

06:56.880 --> 07:02.160
I've done a video on this already, and just a minimal amount of checking brought me to this.

07:02.160 --> 07:06.000
It's an article written by the supposed whistleblower John Bates

07:06.000 --> 07:08.960
just a few days before the Mail story was published.

07:09.600 --> 07:12.960
In it, he outlined in detail what his grievances were,

07:12.960 --> 07:16.240
and they all had to do with the way NOAA archived its material.

07:16.880 --> 07:19.280
Not one mention of fiddling the data.

07:20.000 --> 07:23.360
That all seems to have come from Mail reporter David Rose,

07:23.360 --> 07:26.720
who has a history of getting his facts and his quotes wrong.

07:27.440 --> 07:32.720
Even after the Mail story was published, Bates again said NOAA had not fiddled the figures.

07:34.000 --> 07:39.680
Not only did the Mail get that wrong, it tried to substantiate it with its own made-up graph,

07:39.680 --> 07:43.760
putting the NOAA results on a different baseline to imply that their results

07:43.760 --> 07:47.360
showed a different temperature trend to other temperature monitoring bodies.

07:48.000 --> 07:51.440
But in fact, NOAA's temperature trend is exactly the same

07:51.440 --> 07:54.720
as other temperature monitoring bodies around the world.

07:54.720 --> 07:57.760
It's really not that hard to find this stuff out.

07:58.560 --> 08:04.400
Crowder not only believed the Mail story without question, he even copied the misleading graph.

08:04.400 --> 08:08.640
And he also copied, without verifying, the Mail's claim that this was done

08:08.640 --> 08:12.720
just before the Paris Climate Agreement in order to influence it.

08:12.720 --> 08:16.400
In fact, the magazine that published the NOAA results, Science,

08:16.400 --> 08:21.920
told Mail on Sunday reporter David Rose that it took six months to peer review the information.

08:22.880 --> 08:27.360
Crowder always advocates critical thinking, which I certainly endorse.

08:27.360 --> 08:29.920
But the critical thinking in this case seems to be,

08:29.920 --> 08:34.960
I read it in the Mail, so it must be true, so it's okay to tell my readers it's true.

08:34.960 --> 08:37.920
It's a shame no-one warned him that the Daily Mail is in the habit

08:37.920 --> 08:41.840
of publishing questionable quotes and spurious stories.

08:41.840 --> 08:44.000
Well, this guy tried to.

08:44.000 --> 08:47.040
In February, this alert was posted showing that the Daily Mail

08:47.040 --> 08:50.000
had published a phony story about Neil Gorsuch.

08:50.240 --> 08:52.240
If only Crowder had seen it,

08:52.240 --> 08:55.520
he might have thought twice about trusting something he read in the Mail.

08:56.240 --> 08:59.280
So who exposed the Mail as a purveyor of fake news?

09:01.840 --> 09:04.960
And this other thing got posted claiming that, surprise,

09:04.960 --> 09:08.000
study shows climate change likely not man-made.

09:08.880 --> 09:10.320
And a link to this paper.

09:11.040 --> 09:14.240
Now look at this headline. What do you think it's saying?

09:15.920 --> 09:19.360
Like me, you probably assume it means that a scientific paper

09:19.360 --> 09:23.840
has shown that the recent rise in global temperature is not man-made,

09:23.840 --> 09:25.760
contrary to all scientific opinion.

09:26.640 --> 09:29.280
And that seems to be echoed in the body of the piece.

09:29.840 --> 09:34.480
These scientists have concluded that the climate change has very little to do with humans.

09:34.480 --> 09:40.640
But no, it turns out that the climate change is referring to another period of climate change,

09:40.640 --> 09:45.200
one that happened thousands of years ago while humans were still banging rocks together.

09:45.840 --> 09:47.760
So a more accurate headline would be,

09:48.480 --> 09:53.680
scientific study shows climate change before the appearance of modern man not man-made.

09:53.680 --> 09:55.200
Totally unsurprising.

09:55.920 --> 09:59.520
Team Crowder found something else in the paper that was clearly new to them.

10:00.240 --> 10:04.080
Their theory implies that the Earth has been transmorphing for a while now

10:04.080 --> 10:05.520
and will continue to do so.

10:06.320 --> 10:11.120
I presume they think the word transmorphing means changing climate rather than changing shape.

10:11.760 --> 10:16.640
So does the paper imply that the Earth's climate has always changed and will continue to do so?

10:17.440 --> 10:21.440
Yes, it not only implies that, it takes it for granted,

10:21.440 --> 10:26.320
as does every other paper that's been written on the subject of geology for the last 200 years.

10:26.880 --> 10:29.760
Of course the Earth's climate's always been changing.

10:29.760 --> 10:33.520
If you're wondering how and why the climate could have changed before humans came along,

10:33.520 --> 10:39.120
I've explained that in my video, climate change isn't it natural, and the 800-year lag explained.

10:39.760 --> 10:42.400
It has to do with changing levels of carbon dioxide.

10:43.200 --> 10:45.360
So what was the conclusion of the paper?

10:45.920 --> 10:50.320
Well it wasn't that humans weren't responsible for climate change during the Stone Age,

10:50.320 --> 10:52.160
I think we already knew that.

10:52.160 --> 10:55.520
And it wasn't that humans aren't responsible for climate change now,

10:55.520 --> 10:57.840
because the paper never discussed that.

10:57.840 --> 11:01.840
And it wasn't that the Earth's climate has always changed, because we knew that too.

11:02.880 --> 11:06.080
No, the conclusion of the paper, get ready for it,

11:06.080 --> 11:09.680
is that there was a decreasing trend for increases in insulation

11:09.680 --> 11:12.320
to lead to deglaciations during the Quaternary.

11:12.960 --> 11:17.600
I know, sounds rather dull, but that's why the paper didn't get anyone excited

11:17.600 --> 11:21.040
except Team Crowder, who obviously never read the conclusion.

11:22.080 --> 11:26.000
And they obviously never read this bit either, which says that one of the factors

11:26.000 --> 11:31.440
that led to strong warming at the end of each Quaternary glaciation was carbon dioxide.

11:31.440 --> 11:36.080
So the paper endorses the very theory Team Crowder seems to think it overturns.

11:36.960 --> 11:40.880
All these errors come on top of Crowder's other errors about climate science

11:40.880 --> 11:42.720
that I've already covered.

11:42.720 --> 11:46.480
Such as his claim that falling polar bear numbers are a myth.

11:46.480 --> 11:48.720
His claim that ice sheets aren't melting.

11:48.720 --> 11:53.920
His claim that only 3% of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere comes from anthropogenic sources.

11:54.480 --> 11:57.840
Check my video descriptions for the links and all my sources.

11:59.120 --> 12:03.200
The first time I fact checked Crowder, a lot of his fans got very upset.

12:03.920 --> 12:09.280
Brought in a number of people who told me I'd missed the point of his Top 5 Myths video,

12:09.280 --> 12:11.760
but then couldn't agree on what the point was.

12:12.400 --> 12:17.920
A lot of them claimed his video wasn't about the Top 5 Climate Myths, it was about politics.

12:17.920 --> 12:21.840
Even though Top 5 Climate Myths was the title of the video,

12:21.840 --> 12:24.320
and each of the 5 myths was clearly spelled out.

12:25.040 --> 12:29.120
Others say the point is that these 5 myths are left-wing fallacies.

12:29.120 --> 12:34.960
But as I explained in my response, they're not left-wing fallacies or even right-wing fallacies.

12:34.960 --> 12:39.200
They're either unknown and therefore plausible, or they're scientific facts.

12:39.920 --> 12:45.040
If he'd made left-wing fallacies his top climate change myths, then I would have applauded him.

12:45.040 --> 12:47.840
Because whether they come from left-wingers or right-wingers,

12:47.840 --> 12:51.040
bullshit is bullshit, and it needs to be corrected.

12:51.040 --> 12:54.640
What a shame he didn't choose any of these left-wing fallacies

12:54.640 --> 12:58.240
as his top 5 climate myths, because I've tackled quite a few of them.

12:59.040 --> 13:03.600
Another common message from his fans is that Crowder isn't saying man-made climate change is

13:03.600 --> 13:07.200
false. Sorry, but that's exactly what he's saying.

13:08.480 --> 13:10.960
Unless you want to assume that because he's a comedian,

13:10.960 --> 13:13.680
he's saying the opposite to what he actually thinks.

13:13.680 --> 13:17.200
And that's another argument. He's a comedian, so it's okay,

13:17.200 --> 13:22.400
doesn't excuse the spreading of inaccurate information, either for Crowder or anyone else.

13:23.680 --> 13:26.640
So now we come to the question, why won't I debate him?

13:27.280 --> 13:31.360
The problem is, Crowder's fans are once again unquestioningly believing

13:31.360 --> 13:36.480
what they read on Crowder's website, which as we've seen is not always a good idea.

13:37.360 --> 13:39.840
The answer is, I've offered to do just that.

13:40.480 --> 13:43.360
I'm sure Crowder's just misremembering our exchange.

13:44.080 --> 13:49.360
After I wrote my first response to Steve Crowder and his 5 top climate change myths,

13:49.360 --> 13:53.040
he said some of my criticisms were valid and others weren't.

13:53.040 --> 13:58.880
And I responded by asking him to point out the invalid criticisms, either on my channel or on his.

13:58.880 --> 14:05.440
I was, and still am, happy to debate him. It was Crowder who never responded.

14:06.160 --> 14:11.360
As for going on his show, I responded to that invitation by saying it was possible.

14:11.360 --> 14:14.560
Well, here's a copy of the email I sent to his producer, Jared.

14:15.600 --> 14:19.520
As for the offer of going on the programme, it's possible, but a pain in the arse trying

14:19.520 --> 14:23.520
to coordinate times, especially since I'm on assignment most of the time

14:23.520 --> 14:26.640
and around 12 hours away from US time zones.

14:26.640 --> 14:29.120
But I'm sure we can resolve this very easily

14:29.120 --> 14:33.200
if you just tell me how I misrepresented your position with supporting evidence.

14:33.760 --> 14:36.960
I will then have time to check your evidence and write a response.

14:37.600 --> 14:40.960
Science isn't a matter of opinion but a matter of facts,

14:40.960 --> 14:43.840
and either you got your facts wrong or I did.

14:43.840 --> 14:47.920
If I got my facts wrong, I will be delighted to have them corrected.

14:48.960 --> 14:53.200
I still don't know what these differences are because I still don't know which of my

14:53.200 --> 14:56.560
corrections Crowder accepts and which he doesn't.

14:56.560 --> 14:58.480
So I'm still waiting for a response.

14:59.520 --> 15:04.640
Steve, my invitation for you to respond on your channel or mine still stands,

15:04.640 --> 15:07.120
and here are the claims you made that I dispute.

15:08.000 --> 15:12.480
So pick which ones you accept were wrong and which ones you still stand by.

15:12.480 --> 15:13.440
Let's pin you down.

15:14.080 --> 15:18.080
Of the claims you still stand by, I'll pick one and we'll debate it.

15:18.080 --> 15:22.320
Not all of them at once because pinning you down means sticking to a subject

15:22.320 --> 15:26.320
instead of you or I trying to pivot whenever the going gets tough.

15:27.120 --> 15:29.680
I've rebutted you by quoting your own sources.

15:29.680 --> 15:33.360
So if I'm wrong then either I've misrepresented your sources

15:33.360 --> 15:36.320
or you have some other sources that support your claim.

15:36.960 --> 15:39.920
If you have, tell me what they are and I'll check them.

15:40.800 --> 15:44.640
If you'd rather do this on air, fine, but I'm in Laos at the moment

15:44.640 --> 15:48.960
and then I'm in Korea and Taiwan so I won't be back home until September.

15:49.600 --> 15:52.480
So let's start the debate on your channel or mine,

15:52.480 --> 15:55.280
and then when I'm back in Australia I can phone your show.

15:56.240 --> 15:59.360
But even if we do this on air, the same rules apply.

15:59.360 --> 16:02.720
We can't simply make up facts and shout them at one another.

16:02.720 --> 16:03.600
Agreed?

16:03.600 --> 16:07.200
If we cite facts and figures we have to say where they come from

16:07.200 --> 16:09.280
and give the other person time to check them.

16:10.000 --> 16:13.440
I know that doesn't make great radio, but play some music or something.

16:14.160 --> 16:19.200
I think most intelligent people want to know whose facts are right and whose facts are bogus,

16:19.200 --> 16:23.680
so they would appreciate a calm joint appraisal of the papers you've cited

16:23.760 --> 16:27.040
rather than a shouting match where neither of us is held accountable.

16:27.840 --> 16:31.920
Let's engage in something you always advocate, critical thinking,

16:31.920 --> 16:34.720
rather than just slinging made-up facts at one another.

16:35.360 --> 16:36.000
Agreed?
