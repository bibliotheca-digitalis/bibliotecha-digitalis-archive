800	4160	NASA now says burning fossil fuels cools the planet?
5280	8080	Yes, the question mark and exclamation point are right.
8080	8640	What the f***?
9680	13440	NASA, along with every other major scientific institution in the world,
13440	17200	has been telling us for decades that burning fossil fuels increases
17200	19840	the concentration of CO2 in the atmosphere.
19840	26080	And as scientists have known for over 120 years, an increase of CO2 causes global warming.
26080	29200	And now all of a sudden NASA's telling us it causes cooling?
30000	33680	This fact has been brought to us by my old friend Steve Crowder.
33680	37360	And the only reason I spotted it is because it was above a tweet of his
37360	41600	that someone had told me about, claiming that I'd declined to come on his show.
42240	46640	So before I set the record straight on that, let me deal with this claim first.
47600	52800	Regular subscribers to my channel know exactly what to do when a transparently silly claim like
52800	58320	this hits the blogosphere. Find out where it comes from, trace it right back to its source,
58320	63520	and see how the primary source has been misunderstood or misrepresented along the way.
63520	67200	And in this case starting that trail is as easy as clicking on this link.
68080	73200	It comes from the Sunday Express from over a year earlier.
74080	78800	OK, the next step is to see where the Express got its information from so we can check it.
79600	81360	And it wasn't hard to find out.
81360	85040	I simply googled some of the NASA quotes from the Express story
85040	88320	and it turned out they all came from this NASA press release.
88880	94000	And the source of the NASA press release was this paper which was published in 2015.
94720	98400	People often ask me how to track down sources and that's how it's done.
99040	103120	Now all we have to do is see how the information has changed along the way,
103120	107680	just like the old telephone game, or what we call in the UK, Chinese whispers.
108720	113440	Well, the press release reported the conclusions of the paper accurately, so no change there.
114000	118240	And here's the Express story, with the material copied and pasted verbatim from
118240	122560	the NASA press release highlighted in yellow. So that's all accurate.
123200	125680	What's interesting are the bits in between,
125680	130400	the bits of the press release that for some reason the Express decided to change.
131280	132800	Let's start with the headline.
132800	134960	The title of the NASA paper was
134960	138800	Implications for climate sensitivity from the response to individual forcings.
139440	141680	The NASA press release headline was
141680	146240	NASA study examination of Earth's recent history key to predicting global temperatures.
146960	150160	And let's see what headline the Express decided to run with.
150160	154560	Climate change shock! Burning fossil fuels cools planet, says NASA.
155840	158240	And Crowder echoed the Sunday Express line.
158240	161360	NASA now says burning fossil fuels cools the planet?
162240	163440	Beginning to see the difference?
164080	166640	Let's go to more detail about this alleged cooling.
167360	168400	According to the paper,
169040	173280	Forcings that project more strongly on the northern hemisphere, land or polar regions
173280	177840	are systematically more effective at changing temperatures than an equivalent amount of CO2
177840	181120	whose forcing is more uniformly distributed throughout the globe.
182080	183680	The press release says,
183680	187280	Because earlier studies do not account for what amounts to a net cooling effect
187280	189120	for part of the northern hemisphere,
189120	192720	predictions for TCR and ECS have been lower than they should be.
193600	195840	Now how does the Sunday Express change that?
196400	197200	It goes with,
197200	201200	NASA found a net cooling in the northern hemisphere due to industrial activity.
202080	203360	And Crowder says,
203360	207600	The latest talking point to march to its death, fossil fuels cause global warming,
207600	209040	because they don't!
209040	213120	In fact, NASA says fossil fuels actually cause temporary global cooling.
214560	218880	So we've gone from aerosols causing net cooling in parts of the northern hemisphere
219760	222320	to causing net cooling in the northern hemisphere
222320	225120	to causing temporary cooling across the entire planet.
225760	228960	And from that, let's call it a misunderstanding,
228960	232720	Crowder concludes that fossil fuels don't cause global warming.
233520	236560	If Crowder had checked the tabloid newspaper's source,
236560	239040	instead of simply believing what it said,
239040	243760	he would have discovered the error and not embellished it with completely the wrong conclusion.
244720	248480	What probably confused the Sunday Express and Crowder
248480	252240	is that this may be the first time they've learned that some types of fossil fuels
252240	254160	produce sulfate aerosols,
254160	257840	and that these aerosols reflect sunlight and therefore have a cooling effect.
258560	262080	This was mentioned by NASA because it's what prompted the study,
262080	264960	but of course it wasn't the conclusion of the study.
265840	269440	After all, the cooling effect of aerosols has been known for decades,
269440	271920	and I've even talked about it in my videos.
271920	277360	If you burn high sulfur fossil fuels, you get a lot of sulfate pollution known as aerosols,
277360	280560	and this pollution mitigates the warming effect of CO2.
281120	286240	If you switch to cleaner fuels like natural gas, which doesn't produce so many sulfates,
286240	289280	the aerosols very quickly get washed out of the atmosphere,
289280	293360	the air clears, and you feel the full effects of CO2-induced warming.
294080	297280	Several papers have tried to quantify the effect of aerosols,
297280	301200	and the NASA paper was simply doing that using a more accurate method.
301840	307040	What it found was that previous studies had underestimated the cooling effect of aerosols,
307040	310240	and that means the underlying warming effect of CO2
310240	313760	must be much greater than was previously calculated.
313760	315360	Here's what the NASA study said.
316000	319680	This has been rewritten quite accurately by the press release as,
319680	323200	because earlier studies do not account for what amounts to a net cooling effect
323200	325040	for parts of the northern hemisphere,
325040	328400	predictions for TCR and ECS have been lower than they should be.
329440	331120	The Express changed that to,
331120	336320	existing climate change models have underestimated what the future impact on global temperatures will be.
337120	340320	The Express makes it sound as though other climate models haven't taken
340320	342480	the cooling effect of aerosols into account,
342480	346160	and therefore the Earth is not going to warm as much as we thought.
346160	348720	That's certainly the impression Crowder got.
348720	351920	For years we heard burning fossil fuels caused global warming,
351920	355200	but now they've found that, whoops, no, we meant cooling.
356400	359520	In fact, the NASA paper and the NASA press release
359520	362720	make it clear that their conclusion is the complete opposite.
363280	366800	Burning fossil fuels actually causes more warming than we thought.
367440	370880	I know, again, a lot of Crowder fans will write in
370880	374800	refusing to believe that he could have drawn completely the opposite conclusion
374800	377440	to the conclusion of the NASA study he didn't read.
378080	382160	Well, Crowder always encourages his fans to engage in critical thinking,
382160	385360	so if you don't believe what I'm showing you, that's good.
385360	388240	Do some critical thinking and read the blog,
388800	393360	read the newspaper, the press release, and the study for yourselves.
393360	395520	All my sources are in the video description.
396480	400800	While I was making this video, Crowder posted yet another fallacy on his blog,
401360	405280	and while I was checking and correcting that one, yet another one popped up.
406080	408960	It's hard to keep up, but let's deal with this one first.
409600	412400	Crowder fell for a phony Mail on Sunday story
412400	416160	that claimed a whistleblower had exposed a fiddling of figures by NOAA.
416880	422160	I've done a video on this already, and just a minimal amount of checking brought me to this.
422160	426000	It's an article written by the supposed whistleblower John Bates
426000	428960	just a few days before the Mail story was published.
429600	432960	In it, he outlined in detail what his grievances were,
432960	436240	and they all had to do with the way NOAA archived its material.
436880	439280	Not one mention of fiddling the data.
440000	443360	That all seems to have come from Mail reporter David Rose,
443360	446720	who has a history of getting his facts and his quotes wrong.
447440	452720	Even after the Mail story was published, Bates again said NOAA had not fiddled the figures.
454000	459680	Not only did the Mail get that wrong, it tried to substantiate it with its own made-up graph,
459680	463760	putting the NOAA results on a different baseline to imply that their results
463760	467360	showed a different temperature trend to other temperature monitoring bodies.
468000	471440	But in fact, NOAA's temperature trend is exactly the same
471440	474720	as other temperature monitoring bodies around the world.
474720	477760	It's really not that hard to find this stuff out.
478560	484400	Crowder not only believed the Mail story without question, he even copied the misleading graph.
484400	488640	And he also copied, without verifying, the Mail's claim that this was done
488640	492720	just before the Paris Climate Agreement in order to influence it.
492720	496400	In fact, the magazine that published the NOAA results, Science,
496400	501920	told Mail on Sunday reporter David Rose that it took six months to peer review the information.
502880	507360	Crowder always advocates critical thinking, which I certainly endorse.
507360	509920	But the critical thinking in this case seems to be,
509920	514960	I read it in the Mail, so it must be true, so it's okay to tell my readers it's true.
514960	517920	It's a shame no-one warned him that the Daily Mail is in the habit
517920	521840	of publishing questionable quotes and spurious stories.
521840	524000	Well, this guy tried to.
524000	527040	In February, this alert was posted showing that the Daily Mail
527040	530000	had published a phony story about Neil Gorsuch.
530240	532240	If only Crowder had seen it,
532240	535520	he might have thought twice about trusting something he read in the Mail.
536240	539280	So who exposed the Mail as a purveyor of fake news?
541840	544960	And this other thing got posted claiming that, surprise,
544960	548000	study shows climate change likely not man-made.
548880	550320	And a link to this paper.
551040	554240	Now look at this headline. What do you think it's saying?
555920	559360	Like me, you probably assume it means that a scientific paper
559360	563840	has shown that the recent rise in global temperature is not man-made,
563840	565760	contrary to all scientific opinion.
566640	569280	And that seems to be echoed in the body of the piece.
569840	574480	These scientists have concluded that the climate change has very little to do with humans.
574480	580640	But no, it turns out that the climate change is referring to another period of climate change,
580640	585200	one that happened thousands of years ago while humans were still banging rocks together.
585840	587760	So a more accurate headline would be,
588480	593680	scientific study shows climate change before the appearance of modern man not man-made.
593680	595200	Totally unsurprising.
595920	599520	Team Crowder found something else in the paper that was clearly new to them.
600240	604080	Their theory implies that the Earth has been transmorphing for a while now
604080	605520	and will continue to do so.
606320	611120	I presume they think the word transmorphing means changing climate rather than changing shape.
611760	616640	So does the paper imply that the Earth's climate has always changed and will continue to do so?
617440	621440	Yes, it not only implies that, it takes it for granted,
621440	626320	as does every other paper that's been written on the subject of geology for the last 200 years.
626880	629760	Of course the Earth's climate's always been changing.
629760	633520	If you're wondering how and why the climate could have changed before humans came along,
633520	639120	I've explained that in my video, climate change isn't it natural, and the 800-year lag explained.
639760	642400	It has to do with changing levels of carbon dioxide.
643200	645360	So what was the conclusion of the paper?
645920	650320	Well it wasn't that humans weren't responsible for climate change during the Stone Age,
650320	652160	I think we already knew that.
652160	655520	And it wasn't that humans aren't responsible for climate change now,
655520	657840	because the paper never discussed that.
657840	661840	And it wasn't that the Earth's climate has always changed, because we knew that too.
662880	666080	No, the conclusion of the paper, get ready for it,
666080	669680	is that there was a decreasing trend for increases in insulation
669680	672320	to lead to deglaciations during the Quaternary.
672960	677600	I know, sounds rather dull, but that's why the paper didn't get anyone excited
677600	681040	except Team Crowder, who obviously never read the conclusion.
682080	686000	And they obviously never read this bit either, which says that one of the factors
686000	691440	that led to strong warming at the end of each Quaternary glaciation was carbon dioxide.
691440	696080	So the paper endorses the very theory Team Crowder seems to think it overturns.
696960	700880	All these errors come on top of Crowder's other errors about climate science
700880	702720	that I've already covered.
702720	706480	Such as his claim that falling polar bear numbers are a myth.
706480	708720	His claim that ice sheets aren't melting.
708720	713920	His claim that only 3% of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere comes from anthropogenic sources.
714480	717840	Check my video descriptions for the links and all my sources.
719120	723200	The first time I fact checked Crowder, a lot of his fans got very upset.
723920	729280	Brought in a number of people who told me I'd missed the point of his Top 5 Myths video,
729280	731760	but then couldn't agree on what the point was.
732400	737920	A lot of them claimed his video wasn't about the Top 5 Climate Myths, it was about politics.
737920	741840	Even though Top 5 Climate Myths was the title of the video,
741840	744320	and each of the 5 myths was clearly spelled out.
745040	749120	Others say the point is that these 5 myths are left-wing fallacies.
749120	754960	But as I explained in my response, they're not left-wing fallacies or even right-wing fallacies.
754960	759200	They're either unknown and therefore plausible, or they're scientific facts.
759920	765040	If he'd made left-wing fallacies his top climate change myths, then I would have applauded him.
765040	767840	Because whether they come from left-wingers or right-wingers,
767840	771040	bullshit is bullshit, and it needs to be corrected.
771040	774640	What a shame he didn't choose any of these left-wing fallacies
774640	778240	as his top 5 climate myths, because I've tackled quite a few of them.
779040	783600	Another common message from his fans is that Crowder isn't saying man-made climate change is
783600	787200	false. Sorry, but that's exactly what he's saying.
788480	790960	Unless you want to assume that because he's a comedian,
790960	793680	he's saying the opposite to what he actually thinks.
793680	797200	And that's another argument. He's a comedian, so it's okay,
797200	802400	doesn't excuse the spreading of inaccurate information, either for Crowder or anyone else.
803680	806640	So now we come to the question, why won't I debate him?
807280	811360	The problem is, Crowder's fans are once again unquestioningly believing
811360	816480	what they read on Crowder's website, which as we've seen is not always a good idea.
817360	819840	The answer is, I've offered to do just that.
820480	823360	I'm sure Crowder's just misremembering our exchange.
824080	829360	After I wrote my first response to Steve Crowder and his 5 top climate change myths,
829360	833040	he said some of my criticisms were valid and others weren't.
833040	838880	And I responded by asking him to point out the invalid criticisms, either on my channel or on his.
838880	845440	I was, and still am, happy to debate him. It was Crowder who never responded.
846160	851360	As for going on his show, I responded to that invitation by saying it was possible.
851360	854560	Well, here's a copy of the email I sent to his producer, Jared.
855600	859520	As for the offer of going on the programme, it's possible, but a pain in the arse trying
859520	863520	to coordinate times, especially since I'm on assignment most of the time
863520	866640	and around 12 hours away from US time zones.
866640	869120	But I'm sure we can resolve this very easily
869120	873200	if you just tell me how I misrepresented your position with supporting evidence.
873760	876960	I will then have time to check your evidence and write a response.
877600	880960	Science isn't a matter of opinion but a matter of facts,
880960	883840	and either you got your facts wrong or I did.
883840	887920	If I got my facts wrong, I will be delighted to have them corrected.
888960	893200	I still don't know what these differences are because I still don't know which of my
893200	896560	corrections Crowder accepts and which he doesn't.
896560	898480	So I'm still waiting for a response.
899520	904640	Steve, my invitation for you to respond on your channel or mine still stands,
904640	907120	and here are the claims you made that I dispute.
908000	912480	So pick which ones you accept were wrong and which ones you still stand by.
912480	913440	Let's pin you down.
914080	918080	Of the claims you still stand by, I'll pick one and we'll debate it.
918080	922320	Not all of them at once because pinning you down means sticking to a subject
922320	926320	instead of you or I trying to pivot whenever the going gets tough.
927120	929680	I've rebutted you by quoting your own sources.
929680	933360	So if I'm wrong then either I've misrepresented your sources
933360	936320	or you have some other sources that support your claim.
936960	939920	If you have, tell me what they are and I'll check them.
940800	944640	If you'd rather do this on air, fine, but I'm in Laos at the moment
944640	948960	and then I'm in Korea and Taiwan so I won't be back home until September.
949600	952480	So let's start the debate on your channel or mine,
952480	955280	and then when I'm back in Australia I can phone your show.
956240	959360	But even if we do this on air, the same rules apply.
959360	962720	We can't simply make up facts and shout them at one another.
962720	963600	Agreed?
963600	967200	If we cite facts and figures we have to say where they come from
967200	969280	and give the other person time to check them.
970000	973440	I know that doesn't make great radio, but play some music or something.
974160	979200	I think most intelligent people want to know whose facts are right and whose facts are bogus,
979200	983680	so they would appreciate a calm joint appraisal of the papers you've cited
983760	987040	rather than a shouting match where neither of us is held accountable.
987840	991920	Let's engage in something you always advocate, critical thinking,
991920	994720	rather than just slinging made-up facts at one another.
995360	996000	Agreed?
