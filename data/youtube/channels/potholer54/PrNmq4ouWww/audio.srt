1
00:00:00,800 --> 00:00:04,160
NASA now says burning fossil fuels cools the planet?

2
00:00:05,280 --> 00:00:08,080
Yes, the question mark and exclamation point are right.

3
00:00:08,080 --> 00:00:08,640
What the f***?

4
00:00:09,680 --> 00:00:13,440
NASA, along with every other major scientific institution in the world,

5
00:00:13,440 --> 00:00:17,200
has been telling us for decades that burning fossil fuels increases

6
00:00:17,200 --> 00:00:19,840
the concentration of CO2 in the atmosphere.

7
00:00:19,840 --> 00:00:26,080
And as scientists have known for over 120 years, an increase of CO2 causes global warming.

8
00:00:26,080 --> 00:00:29,200
And now all of a sudden NASA's telling us it causes cooling?

9
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,680
This fact has been brought to us by my old friend Steve Crowder.

10
00:00:33,680 --> 00:00:37,360
And the only reason I spotted it is because it was above a tweet of his

11
00:00:37,360 --> 00:00:41,600
that someone had told me about, claiming that I'd declined to come on his show.

12
00:00:42,240 --> 00:00:46,640
So before I set the record straight on that, let me deal with this claim first.

13
00:00:47,600 --> 00:00:52,800
Regular subscribers to my channel know exactly what to do when a transparently silly claim like

14
00:00:52,800 --> 00:00:58,320
this hits the blogosphere. Find out where it comes from, trace it right back to its source,

15
00:00:58,320 --> 00:01:03,520
and see how the primary source has been misunderstood or misrepresented along the way.

16
00:01:03,520 --> 00:01:07,200
And in this case starting that trail is as easy as clicking on this link.

17
00:01:08,080 --> 00:01:13,200
It comes from the Sunday Express from over a year earlier.

18
00:01:14,080 --> 00:01:18,800
OK, the next step is to see where the Express got its information from so we can check it.

19
00:01:19,600 --> 00:01:21,360
And it wasn't hard to find out.

20
00:01:21,360 --> 00:01:25,040
I simply googled some of the NASA quotes from the Express story

21
00:01:25,040 --> 00:01:28,320
and it turned out they all came from this NASA press release.

22
00:01:28,880 --> 00:01:34,000
And the source of the NASA press release was this paper which was published in 2015.

23
00:01:34,720 --> 00:01:38,400
People often ask me how to track down sources and that's how it's done.

24
00:01:39,040 --> 00:01:43,120
Now all we have to do is see how the information has changed along the way,

25
00:01:43,120 --> 00:01:47,680
just like the old telephone game, or what we call in the UK, Chinese whispers.

26
00:01:48,720 --> 00:01:53,440
Well, the press release reported the conclusions of the paper accurately, so no change there.

27
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:58,240
And here's the Express story, with the material copied and pasted verbatim from

28
00:01:58,240 --> 00:02:02,560
the NASA press release highlighted in yellow. So that's all accurate.

29
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:05,680
What's interesting are the bits in between,

30
00:02:05,680 --> 00:02:10,400
the bits of the press release that for some reason the Express decided to change.

31
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:12,800
Let's start with the headline.

32
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:14,960
The title of the NASA paper was

33
00:02:14,960 --> 00:02:18,800
Implications for climate sensitivity from the response to individual forcings.

34
00:02:19,440 --> 00:02:21,680
The NASA press release headline was

35
00:02:21,680 --> 00:02:26,240
NASA study examination of Earth's recent history key to predicting global temperatures.

36
00:02:26,960 --> 00:02:30,160
And let's see what headline the Express decided to run with.

37
00:02:30,160 --> 00:02:34,560
Climate change shock! Burning fossil fuels cools planet, says NASA.

38
00:02:35,840 --> 00:02:38,240
And Crowder echoed the Sunday Express line.

39
00:02:38,240 --> 00:02:41,360
NASA now says burning fossil fuels cools the planet?

40
00:02:42,240 --> 00:02:43,440
Beginning to see the difference?

41
00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:46,640
Let's go to more detail about this alleged cooling.

42
00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:48,400
According to the paper,

43
00:02:49,040 --> 00:02:53,280
Forcings that project more strongly on the northern hemisphere, land or polar regions

44
00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:57,840
are systematically more effective at changing temperatures than an equivalent amount of CO2

45
00:02:57,840 --> 00:03:01,120
whose forcing is more uniformly distributed throughout the globe.

46
00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:03,680
The press release says,

47
00:03:03,680 --> 00:03:07,280
Because earlier studies do not account for what amounts to a net cooling effect

48
00:03:07,280 --> 00:03:09,120
for part of the northern hemisphere,

49
00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:12,720
predictions for TCR and ECS have been lower than they should be.

50
00:03:13,600 --> 00:03:15,840
Now how does the Sunday Express change that?

51
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:17,200
It goes with,

52
00:03:17,200 --> 00:03:21,200
NASA found a net cooling in the northern hemisphere due to industrial activity.

53
00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:23,360
And Crowder says,

54
00:03:23,360 --> 00:03:27,600
The latest talking point to march to its death, fossil fuels cause global warming,

55
00:03:27,600 --> 00:03:29,040
because they don't!

56
00:03:29,040 --> 00:03:33,120
In fact, NASA says fossil fuels actually cause temporary global cooling.

57
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:38,880
So we've gone from aerosols causing net cooling in parts of the northern hemisphere

58
00:03:39,760 --> 00:03:42,320
to causing net cooling in the northern hemisphere

59
00:03:42,320 --> 00:03:45,120
to causing temporary cooling across the entire planet.

60
00:03:45,760 --> 00:03:48,960
And from that, let's call it a misunderstanding,

61
00:03:48,960 --> 00:03:52,720
Crowder concludes that fossil fuels don't cause global warming.

62
00:03:53,520 --> 00:03:56,560
If Crowder had checked the tabloid newspaper's source,

63
00:03:56,560 --> 00:03:59,040
instead of simply believing what it said,

64
00:03:59,040 --> 00:04:03,760
he would have discovered the error and not embellished it with completely the wrong conclusion.

65
00:04:04,720 --> 00:04:08,480
What probably confused the Sunday Express and Crowder

66
00:04:08,480 --> 00:04:12,240
is that this may be the first time they've learned that some types of fossil fuels

67
00:04:12,240 --> 00:04:14,160
produce sulfate aerosols,

68
00:04:14,160 --> 00:04:17,840
and that these aerosols reflect sunlight and therefore have a cooling effect.

69
00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:22,080
This was mentioned by NASA because it's what prompted the study,

70
00:04:22,080 --> 00:04:24,960
but of course it wasn't the conclusion of the study.

71
00:04:25,840 --> 00:04:29,440
After all, the cooling effect of aerosols has been known for decades,

72
00:04:29,440 --> 00:04:31,920
and I've even talked about it in my videos.

73
00:04:31,920 --> 00:04:37,360
If you burn high sulfur fossil fuels, you get a lot of sulfate pollution known as aerosols,

74
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:40,560
and this pollution mitigates the warming effect of CO2.

75
00:04:41,120 --> 00:04:46,240
If you switch to cleaner fuels like natural gas, which doesn't produce so many sulfates,

76
00:04:46,240 --> 00:04:49,280
the aerosols very quickly get washed out of the atmosphere,

77
00:04:49,280 --> 00:04:53,360
the air clears, and you feel the full effects of CO2-induced warming.

78
00:04:54,080 --> 00:04:57,280
Several papers have tried to quantify the effect of aerosols,

79
00:04:57,280 --> 00:05:01,200
and the NASA paper was simply doing that using a more accurate method.

80
00:05:01,840 --> 00:05:07,040
What it found was that previous studies had underestimated the cooling effect of aerosols,

81
00:05:07,040 --> 00:05:10,240
and that means the underlying warming effect of CO2

82
00:05:10,240 --> 00:05:13,760
must be much greater than was previously calculated.

83
00:05:13,760 --> 00:05:15,360
Here's what the NASA study said.

84
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:19,680
This has been rewritten quite accurately by the press release as,

85
00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:23,200
because earlier studies do not account for what amounts to a net cooling effect

86
00:05:23,200 --> 00:05:25,040
for parts of the northern hemisphere,

87
00:05:25,040 --> 00:05:28,400
predictions for TCR and ECS have been lower than they should be.

88
00:05:29,440 --> 00:05:31,120
The Express changed that to,

89
00:05:31,120 --> 00:05:36,320
existing climate change models have underestimated what the future impact on global temperatures will be.

90
00:05:37,120 --> 00:05:40,320
The Express makes it sound as though other climate models haven't taken

91
00:05:40,320 --> 00:05:42,480
the cooling effect of aerosols into account,

92
00:05:42,480 --> 00:05:46,160
and therefore the Earth is not going to warm as much as we thought.

93
00:05:46,160 --> 00:05:48,720
That's certainly the impression Crowder got.

94
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:51,920
For years we heard burning fossil fuels caused global warming,

95
00:05:51,920 --> 00:05:55,200
but now they've found that, whoops, no, we meant cooling.

96
00:05:56,400 --> 00:05:59,520
In fact, the NASA paper and the NASA press release

97
00:05:59,520 --> 00:06:02,720
make it clear that their conclusion is the complete opposite.

98
00:06:03,280 --> 00:06:06,800
Burning fossil fuels actually causes more warming than we thought.

99
00:06:07,440 --> 00:06:10,880
I know, again, a lot of Crowder fans will write in

100
00:06:10,880 --> 00:06:14,800
refusing to believe that he could have drawn completely the opposite conclusion

101
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:17,440
to the conclusion of the NASA study he didn't read.

102
00:06:18,080 --> 00:06:22,160
Well, Crowder always encourages his fans to engage in critical thinking,

103
00:06:22,160 --> 00:06:25,360
so if you don't believe what I'm showing you, that's good.

104
00:06:25,360 --> 00:06:28,240
Do some critical thinking and read the blog,

105
00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:33,360
read the newspaper, the press release, and the study for yourselves.

106
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:35,520
All my sources are in the video description.

107
00:06:36,480 --> 00:06:40,800
While I was making this video, Crowder posted yet another fallacy on his blog,

108
00:06:41,360 --> 00:06:45,280
and while I was checking and correcting that one, yet another one popped up.

109
00:06:46,080 --> 00:06:48,960
It's hard to keep up, but let's deal with this one first.

110
00:06:49,600 --> 00:06:52,400
Crowder fell for a phony Mail on Sunday story

111
00:06:52,400 --> 00:06:56,160
that claimed a whistleblower had exposed a fiddling of figures by NOAA.

112
00:06:56,880 --> 00:07:02,160
I've done a video on this already, and just a minimal amount of checking brought me to this.

113
00:07:02,160 --> 00:07:06,000
It's an article written by the supposed whistleblower John Bates

114
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:08,960
just a few days before the Mail story was published.

115
00:07:09,600 --> 00:07:12,960
In it, he outlined in detail what his grievances were,

116
00:07:12,960 --> 00:07:16,240
and they all had to do with the way NOAA archived its material.

117
00:07:16,880 --> 00:07:19,280
Not one mention of fiddling the data.

118
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:23,360
That all seems to have come from Mail reporter David Rose,

119
00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:26,720
who has a history of getting his facts and his quotes wrong.

120
00:07:27,440 --> 00:07:32,720
Even after the Mail story was published, Bates again said NOAA had not fiddled the figures.

121
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:39,680
Not only did the Mail get that wrong, it tried to substantiate it with its own made-up graph,

122
00:07:39,680 --> 00:07:43,760
putting the NOAA results on a different baseline to imply that their results

123
00:07:43,760 --> 00:07:47,360
showed a different temperature trend to other temperature monitoring bodies.

124
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:51,440
But in fact, NOAA's temperature trend is exactly the same

125
00:07:51,440 --> 00:07:54,720
as other temperature monitoring bodies around the world.

126
00:07:54,720 --> 00:07:57,760
It's really not that hard to find this stuff out.

127
00:07:58,560 --> 00:08:04,400
Crowder not only believed the Mail story without question, he even copied the misleading graph.

128
00:08:04,400 --> 00:08:08,640
And he also copied, without verifying, the Mail's claim that this was done

129
00:08:08,640 --> 00:08:12,720
just before the Paris Climate Agreement in order to influence it.

130
00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:16,400
In fact, the magazine that published the NOAA results, Science,

131
00:08:16,400 --> 00:08:21,920
told Mail on Sunday reporter David Rose that it took six months to peer review the information.

132
00:08:22,880 --> 00:08:27,360
Crowder always advocates critical thinking, which I certainly endorse.

133
00:08:27,360 --> 00:08:29,920
But the critical thinking in this case seems to be,

134
00:08:29,920 --> 00:08:34,960
I read it in the Mail, so it must be true, so it's okay to tell my readers it's true.

135
00:08:34,960 --> 00:08:37,920
It's a shame no-one warned him that the Daily Mail is in the habit

136
00:08:37,920 --> 00:08:41,840
of publishing questionable quotes and spurious stories.

137
00:08:41,840 --> 00:08:44,000
Well, this guy tried to.

138
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:47,040
In February, this alert was posted showing that the Daily Mail

139
00:08:47,040 --> 00:08:50,000
had published a phony story about Neil Gorsuch.

140
00:08:50,240 --> 00:08:52,240
If only Crowder had seen it,

141
00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:55,520
he might have thought twice about trusting something he read in the Mail.

142
00:08:56,240 --> 00:08:59,280
So who exposed the Mail as a purveyor of fake news?

143
00:09:01,840 --> 00:09:04,960
And this other thing got posted claiming that, surprise,

144
00:09:04,960 --> 00:09:08,000
study shows climate change likely not man-made.

145
00:09:08,880 --> 00:09:10,320
And a link to this paper.

146
00:09:11,040 --> 00:09:14,240
Now look at this headline. What do you think it's saying?

147
00:09:15,920 --> 00:09:19,360
Like me, you probably assume it means that a scientific paper

148
00:09:19,360 --> 00:09:23,840
has shown that the recent rise in global temperature is not man-made,

149
00:09:23,840 --> 00:09:25,760
contrary to all scientific opinion.

150
00:09:26,640 --> 00:09:29,280
And that seems to be echoed in the body of the piece.

151
00:09:29,840 --> 00:09:34,480
These scientists have concluded that the climate change has very little to do with humans.

152
00:09:34,480 --> 00:09:40,640
But no, it turns out that the climate change is referring to another period of climate change,

153
00:09:40,640 --> 00:09:45,200
one that happened thousands of years ago while humans were still banging rocks together.

154
00:09:45,840 --> 00:09:47,760
So a more accurate headline would be,

155
00:09:48,480 --> 00:09:53,680
scientific study shows climate change before the appearance of modern man not man-made.

156
00:09:53,680 --> 00:09:55,200
Totally unsurprising.

157
00:09:55,920 --> 00:09:59,520
Team Crowder found something else in the paper that was clearly new to them.

158
00:10:00,240 --> 00:10:04,080
Their theory implies that the Earth has been transmorphing for a while now

159
00:10:04,080 --> 00:10:05,520
and will continue to do so.

160
00:10:06,320 --> 00:10:11,120
I presume they think the word transmorphing means changing climate rather than changing shape.

161
00:10:11,760 --> 00:10:16,640
So does the paper imply that the Earth's climate has always changed and will continue to do so?

162
00:10:17,440 --> 00:10:21,440
Yes, it not only implies that, it takes it for granted,

163
00:10:21,440 --> 00:10:26,320
as does every other paper that's been written on the subject of geology for the last 200 years.

164
00:10:26,880 --> 00:10:29,760
Of course the Earth's climate's always been changing.

165
00:10:29,760 --> 00:10:33,520
If you're wondering how and why the climate could have changed before humans came along,

166
00:10:33,520 --> 00:10:39,120
I've explained that in my video, climate change isn't it natural, and the 800-year lag explained.

167
00:10:39,760 --> 00:10:42,400
It has to do with changing levels of carbon dioxide.

168
00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:45,360
So what was the conclusion of the paper?

169
00:10:45,920 --> 00:10:50,320
Well it wasn't that humans weren't responsible for climate change during the Stone Age,

170
00:10:50,320 --> 00:10:52,160
I think we already knew that.

171
00:10:52,160 --> 00:10:55,520
And it wasn't that humans aren't responsible for climate change now,

172
00:10:55,520 --> 00:10:57,840
because the paper never discussed that.

173
00:10:57,840 --> 00:11:01,840
And it wasn't that the Earth's climate has always changed, because we knew that too.

174
00:11:02,880 --> 00:11:06,080
No, the conclusion of the paper, get ready for it,

175
00:11:06,080 --> 00:11:09,680
is that there was a decreasing trend for increases in insulation

176
00:11:09,680 --> 00:11:12,320
to lead to deglaciations during the Quaternary.

177
00:11:12,960 --> 00:11:17,600
I know, sounds rather dull, but that's why the paper didn't get anyone excited

178
00:11:17,600 --> 00:11:21,040
except Team Crowder, who obviously never read the conclusion.

179
00:11:22,080 --> 00:11:26,000
And they obviously never read this bit either, which says that one of the factors

180
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:31,440
that led to strong warming at the end of each Quaternary glaciation was carbon dioxide.

181
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:36,080
So the paper endorses the very theory Team Crowder seems to think it overturns.

182
00:11:36,960 --> 00:11:40,880
All these errors come on top of Crowder's other errors about climate science

183
00:11:40,880 --> 00:11:42,720
that I've already covered.

184
00:11:42,720 --> 00:11:46,480
Such as his claim that falling polar bear numbers are a myth.

185
00:11:46,480 --> 00:11:48,720
His claim that ice sheets aren't melting.

186
00:11:48,720 --> 00:11:53,920
His claim that only 3% of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere comes from anthropogenic sources.

187
00:11:54,480 --> 00:11:57,840
Check my video descriptions for the links and all my sources.

188
00:11:59,120 --> 00:12:03,200
The first time I fact checked Crowder, a lot of his fans got very upset.

189
00:12:03,920 --> 00:12:09,280
Brought in a number of people who told me I'd missed the point of his Top 5 Myths video,

190
00:12:09,280 --> 00:12:11,760
but then couldn't agree on what the point was.

191
00:12:12,400 --> 00:12:17,920
A lot of them claimed his video wasn't about the Top 5 Climate Myths, it was about politics.

192
00:12:17,920 --> 00:12:21,840
Even though Top 5 Climate Myths was the title of the video,

193
00:12:21,840 --> 00:12:24,320
and each of the 5 myths was clearly spelled out.

194
00:12:25,040 --> 00:12:29,120
Others say the point is that these 5 myths are left-wing fallacies.

195
00:12:29,120 --> 00:12:34,960
But as I explained in my response, they're not left-wing fallacies or even right-wing fallacies.

196
00:12:34,960 --> 00:12:39,200
They're either unknown and therefore plausible, or they're scientific facts.

197
00:12:39,920 --> 00:12:45,040
If he'd made left-wing fallacies his top climate change myths, then I would have applauded him.

198
00:12:45,040 --> 00:12:47,840
Because whether they come from left-wingers or right-wingers,

199
00:12:47,840 --> 00:12:51,040
bullshit is bullshit, and it needs to be corrected.

200
00:12:51,040 --> 00:12:54,640
What a shame he didn't choose any of these left-wing fallacies

201
00:12:54,640 --> 00:12:58,240
as his top 5 climate myths, because I've tackled quite a few of them.

202
00:12:59,040 --> 00:13:03,600
Another common message from his fans is that Crowder isn't saying man-made climate change is

203
00:13:03,600 --> 00:13:07,200
false. Sorry, but that's exactly what he's saying.

204
00:13:08,480 --> 00:13:10,960
Unless you want to assume that because he's a comedian,

205
00:13:10,960 --> 00:13:13,680
he's saying the opposite to what he actually thinks.

206
00:13:13,680 --> 00:13:17,200
And that's another argument. He's a comedian, so it's okay,

207
00:13:17,200 --> 00:13:22,400
doesn't excuse the spreading of inaccurate information, either for Crowder or anyone else.

208
00:13:23,680 --> 00:13:26,640
So now we come to the question, why won't I debate him?

209
00:13:27,280 --> 00:13:31,360
The problem is, Crowder's fans are once again unquestioningly believing

210
00:13:31,360 --> 00:13:36,480
what they read on Crowder's website, which as we've seen is not always a good idea.

211
00:13:37,360 --> 00:13:39,840
The answer is, I've offered to do just that.

212
00:13:40,480 --> 00:13:43,360
I'm sure Crowder's just misremembering our exchange.

213
00:13:44,080 --> 00:13:49,360
After I wrote my first response to Steve Crowder and his 5 top climate change myths,

214
00:13:49,360 --> 00:13:53,040
he said some of my criticisms were valid and others weren't.

215
00:13:53,040 --> 00:13:58,880
And I responded by asking him to point out the invalid criticisms, either on my channel or on his.

216
00:13:58,880 --> 00:14:05,440
I was, and still am, happy to debate him. It was Crowder who never responded.

217
00:14:06,160 --> 00:14:11,360
As for going on his show, I responded to that invitation by saying it was possible.

218
00:14:11,360 --> 00:14:14,560
Well, here's a copy of the email I sent to his producer, Jared.

219
00:14:15,600 --> 00:14:19,520
As for the offer of going on the programme, it's possible, but a pain in the arse trying

220
00:14:19,520 --> 00:14:23,520
to coordinate times, especially since I'm on assignment most of the time

221
00:14:23,520 --> 00:14:26,640
and around 12 hours away from US time zones.

222
00:14:26,640 --> 00:14:29,120
But I'm sure we can resolve this very easily

223
00:14:29,120 --> 00:14:33,200
if you just tell me how I misrepresented your position with supporting evidence.

224
00:14:33,760 --> 00:14:36,960
I will then have time to check your evidence and write a response.

225
00:14:37,600 --> 00:14:40,960
Science isn't a matter of opinion but a matter of facts,

226
00:14:40,960 --> 00:14:43,840
and either you got your facts wrong or I did.

227
00:14:43,840 --> 00:14:47,920
If I got my facts wrong, I will be delighted to have them corrected.

228
00:14:48,960 --> 00:14:53,200
I still don't know what these differences are because I still don't know which of my

229
00:14:53,200 --> 00:14:56,560
corrections Crowder accepts and which he doesn't.

230
00:14:56,560 --> 00:14:58,480
So I'm still waiting for a response.

231
00:14:59,520 --> 00:15:04,640
Steve, my invitation for you to respond on your channel or mine still stands,

232
00:15:04,640 --> 00:15:07,120
and here are the claims you made that I dispute.

233
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:12,480
So pick which ones you accept were wrong and which ones you still stand by.

234
00:15:12,480 --> 00:15:13,440
Let's pin you down.

235
00:15:14,080 --> 00:15:18,080
Of the claims you still stand by, I'll pick one and we'll debate it.

236
00:15:18,080 --> 00:15:22,320
Not all of them at once because pinning you down means sticking to a subject

237
00:15:22,320 --> 00:15:26,320
instead of you or I trying to pivot whenever the going gets tough.

238
00:15:27,120 --> 00:15:29,680
I've rebutted you by quoting your own sources.

239
00:15:29,680 --> 00:15:33,360
So if I'm wrong then either I've misrepresented your sources

240
00:15:33,360 --> 00:15:36,320
or you have some other sources that support your claim.

241
00:15:36,960 --> 00:15:39,920
If you have, tell me what they are and I'll check them.

242
00:15:40,800 --> 00:15:44,640
If you'd rather do this on air, fine, but I'm in Laos at the moment

243
00:15:44,640 --> 00:15:48,960
and then I'm in Korea and Taiwan so I won't be back home until September.

244
00:15:49,600 --> 00:15:52,480
So let's start the debate on your channel or mine,

245
00:15:52,480 --> 00:15:55,280
and then when I'm back in Australia I can phone your show.

246
00:15:56,240 --> 00:15:59,360
But even if we do this on air, the same rules apply.

247
00:15:59,360 --> 00:16:02,720
We can't simply make up facts and shout them at one another.

248
00:16:02,720 --> 00:16:03,600
Agreed?

249
00:16:03,600 --> 00:16:07,200
If we cite facts and figures we have to say where they come from

250
00:16:07,200 --> 00:16:09,280
and give the other person time to check them.

251
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:13,440
I know that doesn't make great radio, but play some music or something.

252
00:16:14,160 --> 00:16:19,200
I think most intelligent people want to know whose facts are right and whose facts are bogus,

253
00:16:19,200 --> 00:16:23,680
so they would appreciate a calm joint appraisal of the papers you've cited

254
00:16:23,760 --> 00:16:27,040
rather than a shouting match where neither of us is held accountable.

255
00:16:27,840 --> 00:16:31,920
Let's engage in something you always advocate, critical thinking,

256
00:16:31,920 --> 00:16:34,720
rather than just slinging made-up facts at one another.

257
00:16:35,360 --> 00:16:36,000
Agreed?
