00:00.000 --> 00:02.000
Well, hello there.

00:02.000 --> 00:03.000
Hello.

00:03.000 --> 00:05.000
Welcome to my video message.

00:05.000 --> 00:06.000
Thank you.

00:06.000 --> 00:09.000
To the atheist movement worldwide.

00:09.000 --> 00:12.000
We are here to debunk you.

00:12.000 --> 00:14.000
Oh no.

00:14.000 --> 00:23.000
Have you ever wondered why the earth does not suffer from severe hurricanes and wind blasts that would blow mankind right off this planet?

00:23.000 --> 00:24.000
No.

00:24.000 --> 00:39.000
Speeding along at 67,000 miles per hour and spinning at 1,000 miles per hour would certainly test your fortitude to stay on the orbital earth vehicle which it is not.

00:39.000 --> 00:41.000
It is not moving.

00:41.000 --> 00:42.000
What?

00:42.000 --> 00:46.000
It's been that way from the beginning.

00:46.000 --> 00:49.000
It's written that way in the Holy Word of God.

00:50.000 --> 00:56.000
And for some reason, it was withheld from the students as heliocentrism.

00:56.000 --> 00:58.000
You see, it depends on your perception.

00:58.000 --> 01:06.000
If you're looking from the earth and the stars are moving and the sun is moving and you say, yes, we're moving around them, that's your perception.

01:06.000 --> 01:09.000
It's just like the old-fashioned wind-up clock.

01:09.000 --> 01:15.000
When you wound it up, if you let go of it and you held onto the clock, the key went around.

01:15.000 --> 01:18.000
And if you held onto the key, the clock went around.

01:18.000 --> 01:20.000
Colonel Sanders is right.

01:20.000 --> 01:25.000
How can we know that the earth isn't standing still and the entire universe isn't spinning around us?

01:25.000 --> 01:30.000
After all, the Bible says the earth is fixed and here are the biblical verses to prove it.

01:30.000 --> 01:34.000
Psalm 93, 1, the Lord reigns, he is clothed with majesty.

01:34.000 --> 01:39.000
The Lord is clothed with strength wherewith he has girded himself.

01:39.000 --> 01:43.000
The world also is established that it cannot be moved.

01:43.000 --> 01:45.000
Psalm 96, 10.

01:45.000 --> 01:47.000
You're a scary man.

01:49.000 --> 01:52.000
Say among the heathen the Lord reigns.

01:52.000 --> 01:58.000
The world also shall be established that it shall not be moved.

01:58.000 --> 02:00.000
And there are a lot more verses where that came from.

02:00.000 --> 02:05.000
Megasage is making a list and we can only assume he's checking it twice.

02:05.000 --> 02:11.000
Biblical scholars believed in a fixed earth for much longer than they believed the earth orbits the sun.

02:11.000 --> 02:17.000
A moving earth was the key heresy that church inquisitors forced Galileo to rescind.

02:17.000 --> 02:23.000
And it wasn't until 1992 that the Pope officially admitted that Galileo was right all along.

02:23.000 --> 02:27.000
So isn't Megasage just one man crying in the wilderness?

02:27.000 --> 02:29.000
Oh my God, there's two of them.

02:29.000 --> 02:31.000
Has he been cloned?

02:31.000 --> 02:37.000
No, apparently belief in a geocentric world where stars and galaxies whizz around the earth at trillions of times the speed of light,

02:37.000 --> 02:39.000
defying the laws of physics.

02:39.000 --> 02:46.000
Apparently that belief is held by many creationists and not just by old men who look as though they're trying to form a ZZ top tribute band.

02:46.000 --> 02:51.000
It's also shared by our next Golden Crocoduck nominee, Ferny Boy.

02:51.000 --> 02:53.000
He reckons he can prove it with physics.

02:53.000 --> 03:00.000
In this video we're going to look at the situation and we're going to see if the earth can possibly be spinning or not.

03:00.000 --> 03:03.000
Great, an experiment. That's what science is all about.

03:04.000 --> 03:08.000
So what experiment has Ferny Boy done to show that the earth isn't spinning?

03:08.000 --> 03:12.000
Taken measurements of the relative velocities of distant galaxies?

03:12.000 --> 03:17.000
Done a recalculation of Coriolis forces on earth or the speed of the jet stream?

03:17.000 --> 03:20.000
No, his budget didn't quite stretch to that.

03:22.000 --> 03:28.000
Yes, Ferny Boy invested about a hundred bucks in a toy truck and a remote controlled model helicopter.

03:28.000 --> 03:33.000
The principle behind this is, if the earth was spinning at 1,000 miles an hour at the equator,

03:33.000 --> 03:39.000
then as soon as you jump in the air you'd be left behind as the earth keeps spinning underneath you.

03:39.000 --> 03:42.000
Or looked at from the perspective of the people who are standing,

03:42.000 --> 03:47.000
if you jump in the air it would look as though you're being suddenly shot backwards at 1,000 miles an hour.

03:50.000 --> 03:52.000
Ferny Boy shows this principle here.

03:52.000 --> 03:57.000
The vehicle keeps moving but when the helicopter rises it doesn't move with it.

03:57.000 --> 03:59.000
I hope you realise what this means.

03:59.000 --> 04:05.000
It means that if you open the door and leap from a moving express train, you'll be instantly motionless.

04:05.000 --> 04:09.000
You face nothing worse than a simple drop of a few feet to the ground.

04:09.000 --> 04:15.000
So why didn't David Adams simply jump down a couple of feet and walk away from this train

04:15.000 --> 04:20.000
instead of pretending he's got some sort of forward momentum and doing a dramatic roll in the sand?

04:20.000 --> 04:22.000
Obviously, just showing off.

04:23.000 --> 04:28.000
I don't think that was the smartest move in the world. Jumping off trains I don't recommend.

04:28.000 --> 04:33.000
I don't know if I've actually broken my collarbone but I've certainly given it a hell of a jar.

04:33.000 --> 04:40.000
So we'll just see what happens. But I wouldn't recommend jumping off trains.

04:40.000 --> 04:46.000
On the contrary, if Ferny Boy is right then there's no danger at all in jumping off a moving train or a moving truck

04:46.000 --> 04:50.000
because, as his experiment showed, objects don't have inertia.

04:51.000 --> 04:56.000
In fact, there's no point in trains even stopping at stations. Passengers could just leap out whenever they like

04:56.000 --> 05:01.000
because they have no forward momentum. It would be no worse than jumping off a log.

05:01.000 --> 05:06.000
In fact, Ferny Boy should move to the next logical step of his experimental process

05:06.000 --> 05:10.000
and be the first to try out his new theory on a speeding train.

05:10.000 --> 05:15.000
Now, of course, the smart arses among you will say that moving objects have inertia

05:15.000 --> 05:21.000
and that this has been established ever since Isaac Newton laid down his laws on motion in the 17th century.

05:21.000 --> 05:28.000
Well, what does Isaac Newton know? Ferny Boy's just disproved it with a helicopter, something they didn't have back then.

05:28.000 --> 05:33.000
And, of course, you could say that obviously the helicopter would be able to counteract its forward momentum

05:33.000 --> 05:40.000
because it's powered and Newton's law says that an object will continue moving unless acted on by an external force

05:41.000 --> 05:48.000
such as the force of the rotor blades or air resistance. Well, all I can say to that is, good point.

05:48.000 --> 05:56.000
But like scary Colonel Sanders, Ferny Boy doesn't base his views on the laws of physics but on what he calls the Word of God.

05:56.000 --> 06:04.000
Now, there's just one problem with Ferny Boy. He's clearly so clueless about basic physics that it's possible this is a parody.

06:04.000 --> 06:10.000
It's sometimes hard to tell the difference. So, let's go to a real creationist and a man whose IQ is off the charts

06:10.000 --> 06:18.000
to get the definitive word on how modern creationists no longer believe this Bronze Age belief that the Earth is the immovable centre of the universe.

06:18.000 --> 06:21.000
It's all relative. So, anyway, I'm kind of sitting on the fence on that one.

06:21.000 --> 06:22.000
You're doing what?

06:22.000 --> 06:29.000
I lean towards the direction that the Earth is spinning. Coriolis forces, for example, is one reason I would say the Earth is spinning.

06:29.000 --> 06:33.000
But how about gravity?

06:34.000 --> 06:40.000
And the great thing about a man whose IQ is off the charts is that you can actually hear the gears of his brain grinding

06:40.000 --> 06:44.000
as they contemplate this 500-year-old piece of information.

06:49.000 --> 06:50.000
What about it?

06:50.000 --> 07:02.000
Well, it's a bit like a magnet. If you have a small magnet and a big magnet, the big magnet is the one that's going to pull the little magnet around and not the little that's going to pull the big one.

07:02.000 --> 07:09.000
So, if you compare the Earth next to the Sun, which one is going to make the other one spin around?

07:12.000 --> 07:20.000
The Sun will make the Earth spin around. And that's one of the other reasons, too, is the whole gravitational thing.

07:20.000 --> 07:31.000
Because geocentrism would... I could be wrong on this, but I would think geocentrism requires a continuous miracle.

07:31.000 --> 07:44.000
Geocentrism is kind of the clincher for me. Because you would have to have this... let's say the Sun is orbiting around the Earth, then it's going to, over time, it's going to get out of balance.

07:44.000 --> 07:50.000
And it's going to switch places. The Sun will wind up in the middle, for the reasons I just said, and Earth is going to wind up on the outside.

07:50.000 --> 07:59.000
No Ian, it's not going to go out of balance or switch places. Two large bodies in space orbit each other according to a very basic law of physics.

07:59.000 --> 08:07.000
Neither one orbits the other. In fact, they both orbit a common point, called the barycentre, in between their centres of mass.

08:07.000 --> 08:13.000
In the case of our solar system, the Sun and planets orbit around their common barycentre.

08:13.000 --> 08:21.000
Of course, because the Sun is so massive, the barycentre is actually very close to the centre of the Sun, but the result gives the Sun a very distinctive wobble.

08:21.000 --> 08:29.000
You can also see it in the way a hammer thrower pivots around the barycentre between him and the hammer. The thrower moves with a slight wobble.

08:29.000 --> 08:37.000
Come on Ian, I learnt this in seventh grade. My physics teacher even gave us the example of the hammer thrower. It's as easy to understand as that.

08:37.000 --> 08:43.000
So it's not a case of maybe a larger object orbited a smaller one and then they switched around.

08:43.000 --> 08:49.000
You've got to at least be able to look at a junior high school science textbook and figure out why that can't happen.

08:49.000 --> 08:53.000
You could even have checked that by the time it took you to lay out a dinosaur egg display.

08:53.000 --> 09:00.000
Still, one thing I'll say for these geocentrists is at least they're being honest in their interpretation of the Bible.

09:00.000 --> 09:05.000
It does indeed say that the Earth is the centre of the universe and doesn't move.

09:05.000 --> 09:16.000
It's only when science came along and showed that that was not the case that all of a sudden the Bible was reinterpreted, as it always is when science shows it's wrong.
