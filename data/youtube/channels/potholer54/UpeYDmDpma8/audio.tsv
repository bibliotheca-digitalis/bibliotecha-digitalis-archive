0	2000	Well, hello there.
2000	3000	Hello.
3000	5000	Welcome to my video message.
5000	6000	Thank you.
6000	9000	To the atheist movement worldwide.
9000	12000	We are here to debunk you.
12000	14000	Oh no.
14000	23000	Have you ever wondered why the earth does not suffer from severe hurricanes and wind blasts that would blow mankind right off this planet?
23000	24000	No.
24000	39000	Speeding along at 67,000 miles per hour and spinning at 1,000 miles per hour would certainly test your fortitude to stay on the orbital earth vehicle which it is not.
39000	41000	It is not moving.
41000	42000	What?
42000	46000	It's been that way from the beginning.
46000	49000	It's written that way in the Holy Word of God.
50000	56000	And for some reason, it was withheld from the students as heliocentrism.
56000	58000	You see, it depends on your perception.
58000	66000	If you're looking from the earth and the stars are moving and the sun is moving and you say, yes, we're moving around them, that's your perception.
66000	69000	It's just like the old-fashioned wind-up clock.
69000	75000	When you wound it up, if you let go of it and you held onto the clock, the key went around.
75000	78000	And if you held onto the key, the clock went around.
78000	80000	Colonel Sanders is right.
80000	85000	How can we know that the earth isn't standing still and the entire universe isn't spinning around us?
85000	90000	After all, the Bible says the earth is fixed and here are the biblical verses to prove it.
90000	94000	Psalm 93, 1, the Lord reigns, he is clothed with majesty.
94000	99000	The Lord is clothed with strength wherewith he has girded himself.
99000	103000	The world also is established that it cannot be moved.
103000	105000	Psalm 96, 10.
105000	107000	You're a scary man.
109000	112000	Say among the heathen the Lord reigns.
112000	118000	The world also shall be established that it shall not be moved.
118000	120000	And there are a lot more verses where that came from.
120000	125000	Megasage is making a list and we can only assume he's checking it twice.
125000	131000	Biblical scholars believed in a fixed earth for much longer than they believed the earth orbits the sun.
131000	137000	A moving earth was the key heresy that church inquisitors forced Galileo to rescind.
137000	143000	And it wasn't until 1992 that the Pope officially admitted that Galileo was right all along.
143000	147000	So isn't Megasage just one man crying in the wilderness?
147000	149000	Oh my God, there's two of them.
149000	151000	Has he been cloned?
151000	157000	No, apparently belief in a geocentric world where stars and galaxies whizz around the earth at trillions of times the speed of light,
157000	159000	defying the laws of physics.
159000	166000	Apparently that belief is held by many creationists and not just by old men who look as though they're trying to form a ZZ top tribute band.
166000	171000	It's also shared by our next Golden Crocoduck nominee, Ferny Boy.
171000	173000	He reckons he can prove it with physics.
173000	180000	In this video we're going to look at the situation and we're going to see if the earth can possibly be spinning or not.
180000	183000	Great, an experiment. That's what science is all about.
184000	188000	So what experiment has Ferny Boy done to show that the earth isn't spinning?
188000	192000	Taken measurements of the relative velocities of distant galaxies?
192000	197000	Done a recalculation of Coriolis forces on earth or the speed of the jet stream?
197000	200000	No, his budget didn't quite stretch to that.
202000	208000	Yes, Ferny Boy invested about a hundred bucks in a toy truck and a remote controlled model helicopter.
208000	213000	The principle behind this is, if the earth was spinning at 1,000 miles an hour at the equator,
213000	219000	then as soon as you jump in the air you'd be left behind as the earth keeps spinning underneath you.
219000	222000	Or looked at from the perspective of the people who are standing,
222000	227000	if you jump in the air it would look as though you're being suddenly shot backwards at 1,000 miles an hour.
230000	232000	Ferny Boy shows this principle here.
232000	237000	The vehicle keeps moving but when the helicopter rises it doesn't move with it.
237000	239000	I hope you realise what this means.
239000	245000	It means that if you open the door and leap from a moving express train, you'll be instantly motionless.
245000	249000	You face nothing worse than a simple drop of a few feet to the ground.
249000	255000	So why didn't David Adams simply jump down a couple of feet and walk away from this train
255000	260000	instead of pretending he's got some sort of forward momentum and doing a dramatic roll in the sand?
260000	262000	Obviously, just showing off.
263000	268000	I don't think that was the smartest move in the world. Jumping off trains I don't recommend.
268000	273000	I don't know if I've actually broken my collarbone but I've certainly given it a hell of a jar.
273000	280000	So we'll just see what happens. But I wouldn't recommend jumping off trains.
280000	286000	On the contrary, if Ferny Boy is right then there's no danger at all in jumping off a moving train or a moving truck
286000	290000	because, as his experiment showed, objects don't have inertia.
291000	296000	In fact, there's no point in trains even stopping at stations. Passengers could just leap out whenever they like
296000	301000	because they have no forward momentum. It would be no worse than jumping off a log.
301000	306000	In fact, Ferny Boy should move to the next logical step of his experimental process
306000	310000	and be the first to try out his new theory on a speeding train.
310000	315000	Now, of course, the smart arses among you will say that moving objects have inertia
315000	321000	and that this has been established ever since Isaac Newton laid down his laws on motion in the 17th century.
321000	328000	Well, what does Isaac Newton know? Ferny Boy's just disproved it with a helicopter, something they didn't have back then.
328000	333000	And, of course, you could say that obviously the helicopter would be able to counteract its forward momentum
333000	340000	because it's powered and Newton's law says that an object will continue moving unless acted on by an external force
341000	348000	such as the force of the rotor blades or air resistance. Well, all I can say to that is, good point.
348000	356000	But like scary Colonel Sanders, Ferny Boy doesn't base his views on the laws of physics but on what he calls the Word of God.
356000	364000	Now, there's just one problem with Ferny Boy. He's clearly so clueless about basic physics that it's possible this is a parody.
364000	370000	It's sometimes hard to tell the difference. So, let's go to a real creationist and a man whose IQ is off the charts
370000	378000	to get the definitive word on how modern creationists no longer believe this Bronze Age belief that the Earth is the immovable centre of the universe.
378000	381000	It's all relative. So, anyway, I'm kind of sitting on the fence on that one.
381000	382000	You're doing what?
382000	389000	I lean towards the direction that the Earth is spinning. Coriolis forces, for example, is one reason I would say the Earth is spinning.
389000	393000	But how about gravity?
394000	400000	And the great thing about a man whose IQ is off the charts is that you can actually hear the gears of his brain grinding
400000	404000	as they contemplate this 500-year-old piece of information.
409000	410000	What about it?
410000	422000	Well, it's a bit like a magnet. If you have a small magnet and a big magnet, the big magnet is the one that's going to pull the little magnet around and not the little that's going to pull the big one.
422000	429000	So, if you compare the Earth next to the Sun, which one is going to make the other one spin around?
432000	440000	The Sun will make the Earth spin around. And that's one of the other reasons, too, is the whole gravitational thing.
440000	451000	Because geocentrism would... I could be wrong on this, but I would think geocentrism requires a continuous miracle.
451000	464000	Geocentrism is kind of the clincher for me. Because you would have to have this... let's say the Sun is orbiting around the Earth, then it's going to, over time, it's going to get out of balance.
464000	470000	And it's going to switch places. The Sun will wind up in the middle, for the reasons I just said, and Earth is going to wind up on the outside.
470000	479000	No Ian, it's not going to go out of balance or switch places. Two large bodies in space orbit each other according to a very basic law of physics.
479000	487000	Neither one orbits the other. In fact, they both orbit a common point, called the barycentre, in between their centres of mass.
487000	493000	In the case of our solar system, the Sun and planets orbit around their common barycentre.
493000	501000	Of course, because the Sun is so massive, the barycentre is actually very close to the centre of the Sun, but the result gives the Sun a very distinctive wobble.
501000	509000	You can also see it in the way a hammer thrower pivots around the barycentre between him and the hammer. The thrower moves with a slight wobble.
509000	517000	Come on Ian, I learnt this in seventh grade. My physics teacher even gave us the example of the hammer thrower. It's as easy to understand as that.
517000	523000	So it's not a case of maybe a larger object orbited a smaller one and then they switched around.
523000	529000	You've got to at least be able to look at a junior high school science textbook and figure out why that can't happen.
529000	533000	You could even have checked that by the time it took you to lay out a dinosaur egg display.
533000	540000	Still, one thing I'll say for these geocentrists is at least they're being honest in their interpretation of the Bible.
540000	545000	It does indeed say that the Earth is the centre of the universe and doesn't move.
545000	556000	It's only when science came along and showed that that was not the case that all of a sudden the Bible was reinterpreted, as it always is when science shows it's wrong.
