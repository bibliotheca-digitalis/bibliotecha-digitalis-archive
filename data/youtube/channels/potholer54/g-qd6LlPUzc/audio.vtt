00:00.000 --> 00:12.800
Before I look at the winner of this year's Coq, a word on the name.

00:12.800 --> 00:18.000
The Coq is the Defiance in Ignorance prize for the dumbest question asked in the arrogant

00:18.000 --> 00:20.760
belief that there's no possible answer.

00:20.760 --> 00:25.400
It was originally called the Stone Commander prize, named after the guy who asked why all

00:25.400 --> 00:26.880
the planets are round.

00:26.880 --> 00:31.500
But Stone Commander later retracted his question and apologised for the rather aggressive way

00:31.500 --> 00:36.840
in which he had phrased it, so I had to rename the prize, and it was called the Coq after

00:36.840 --> 00:40.240
a YouTuber who won it the following year.

00:40.240 --> 00:45.240
But then the YouTuber, Coq, real name Andy, released a video in which he recanted his

00:45.240 --> 00:46.240
faith.

00:46.240 --> 00:50.280
Sorry, I am no longer a Christian because I don't want to be in that club.

00:50.280 --> 00:51.520
Two in a row.

00:51.520 --> 00:56.580
The Defiance in Ignorance prize seems to have that kind of reverse Road to Damascus effect

00:56.580 --> 00:59.000
on those on whom it's bestowed.

00:59.000 --> 01:03.340
In view of Andy's conversion, I was going to rename the prize yet again, and according

01:03.340 --> 01:09.180
to tradition, name it after the last recipient not to recant his beliefs, in other words,

01:09.180 --> 01:10.460
the Bill.

01:10.460 --> 01:14.940
But then Andy released a video that shows he's not ready to relinquish the title just

01:14.940 --> 01:15.940
yet.

01:15.940 --> 01:16.940
Sorry, Bill.

01:16.940 --> 01:18.580
The fucking thing sucks!

01:18.580 --> 01:19.580
Billy!

01:19.580 --> 01:21.580
Now sit and watch Andy's video nicely.

01:21.580 --> 01:27.580
How comes when I eat a banana it doesn't poison me?

01:27.580 --> 01:32.520
If evolution is true, and the survival of the fittest, and all that kind of thing is

01:32.520 --> 01:40.780
going on, then how comes when I munch into this nice, I suppose juicy really, this nice

01:40.780 --> 01:42.940
firm banana, it's not going to kill me?

01:42.940 --> 01:43.940
So that's it.

01:43.940 --> 01:47.100
If evolution is true, why aren't bananas poisonous?

01:47.100 --> 01:52.780
It's rather like asking, if evolution is true, how come monkeys can breathe?

01:52.780 --> 01:57.140
Now before you start wondering whether Andy has won the cock yet again, let me point out

01:57.140 --> 02:01.200
that, dumb as his question is, there is one that's better.

02:01.200 --> 02:03.580
So he's not this year's recipient.

02:03.580 --> 02:07.500
But his question does show that the prize is still deserving of his name.

02:07.500 --> 02:12.260
The penis, not a very nice word, an embarrassing word.

02:12.260 --> 02:14.500
Yes, but you chose it, Andy.

02:14.500 --> 02:17.380
So the prize remains named in your honour.

02:17.380 --> 02:21.580
And just to show how dumb your question was in the defiant belief that there's no possible

02:21.580 --> 02:27.300
answer, let me explain why bananas don't poison people who eat them, and don't want to poison

02:27.300 --> 02:29.020
people who eat them.

02:29.020 --> 02:33.900
And I'll start with the response I gave to Ray Comfort, who was also fixated with bananas.

02:33.900 --> 02:36.500
Behold, the atheist's nightmare.

02:36.500 --> 02:37.500
Yeah!

02:37.500 --> 02:44.860
Okay, that's enough, Ray.

02:44.860 --> 02:49.140
As I pointed out, the modern banana has been cultivated over thousands of years, and it's

02:49.140 --> 02:53.100
descended from an ancestor that was chock full of seeds.

02:53.100 --> 02:54.740
That's what makes it a fruit.

02:54.740 --> 02:56.820
More specifically, a berry.

02:56.820 --> 03:01.620
And all fruits are edible, if not by us, then by other birds or animals.

03:01.620 --> 03:04.860
They have to be in order to propagate the species.

03:04.860 --> 03:07.820
So why does Andy think fruits ought to be poisonous?

03:07.820 --> 03:14.620
If evolution were true, and a survival of the fittest, why has not the banana tree or

03:14.620 --> 03:20.780
the apple tree or the orange tree, the limes and lemons, and the plums and all the other

03:20.780 --> 03:27.400
fruit trees and other fruit plants as well, how come they have not evolved some kind of

03:27.400 --> 03:31.860
a mechanism to repel people like me from eating bananas?

03:31.860 --> 03:34.020
Let's try another analogy, Andy.

03:34.100 --> 03:38.580
Asking why fruit or berries haven't evolved some mechanism to stop animals eating them

03:38.580 --> 03:42.860
is like asking why women haven't developed some mechanism to stop men wanting to have

03:42.860 --> 03:44.220
sex with them.

03:44.220 --> 03:49.040
Why flowers haven't developed some mechanism to stop bees taking their pollen.

03:49.040 --> 03:53.840
You do understand that the whole purpose of a fruit or a berry is to encourage its consumption

03:53.840 --> 03:55.940
by animals, right?

03:55.940 --> 03:58.460
Okay, obviously this is a little hard.

03:58.460 --> 04:03.500
Let's get Tonto in to explain the whole thing in just 29 words of one syllable.

04:28.460 --> 04:41.980
Bear poop seed in woods, new tree grow, get it, cock?

04:41.980 --> 04:46.060
So it looks like the cock will have to keep its name until Andy's conversion into the

04:46.060 --> 04:48.260
world of reality is complete.

04:48.260 --> 04:52.900
But now let's unveil the face of this year's real winner from behind the trashy redneck

04:52.900 --> 04:54.260
curtain.

04:54.260 --> 04:56.640
This is a YouTuber called Moanne.

04:56.640 --> 05:01.000
Now in case you don't get what you're about to see, Moanne plays two roles in the following

05:01.000 --> 05:02.520
video clip.

05:02.520 --> 05:06.520
Normally he shows the intelligent face of a creationist, but when he wants to portray

05:06.520 --> 05:12.040
an atheist he uses his incomparable acting skills to completely transform his appearance

05:12.040 --> 05:13.720
into someone stupid.

05:13.720 --> 05:14.720
Like this.

05:14.720 --> 05:17.960
I know, hard to believe it's the same person.

05:17.960 --> 05:23.360
Dumb atheist, smart creationist, smart creationist, dumb atheist.

05:23.360 --> 05:24.360
All clear?

05:24.360 --> 05:26.080
Okay then, on to the question.

05:26.080 --> 05:28.880
Excuse me, Mr. Atheist, you believe in evolution.

05:28.880 --> 05:34.000
And even though it's okay to believe in evolution and God at the same time, I just have a question

05:34.000 --> 05:35.080
for you.

05:35.080 --> 05:38.360
What came first, the chicken or the egg?

05:38.360 --> 05:39.360
The egg.

05:39.360 --> 05:43.440
Well, I guess the chicken came first, yeah.

05:43.440 --> 05:44.440
The chicken.

05:44.440 --> 05:45.440
No, the egg.

05:45.440 --> 05:46.640
But chickens come from eggs.

05:46.640 --> 05:51.040
Oh, um, well, I guess the egg came first.

05:51.040 --> 05:52.280
Yeah, the egg.

05:52.280 --> 05:53.280
That's what I said.

05:53.280 --> 05:54.960
But eggs come from chickens.

05:54.960 --> 06:00.560
No, eggs come from just about every reproductive animal, they're not exclusive to chickens.

06:00.560 --> 06:05.320
The oldest egg fossils that have been found date back to the Cambrian, over 500 million

06:05.320 --> 06:06.920
years ago.

06:06.920 --> 06:11.000
Before fish, before reptiles, and long before chickens.

06:11.000 --> 06:16.720
Chickens didn't turn up in the fossil record until fairly recently on the geological timescale.

06:16.720 --> 06:20.840
Even if you only want to look at eggs with a yolk and a hard shell that get sat on in

06:20.840 --> 06:25.920
a nest, they were laid by the ancestors of chickens hundreds of millions of years before

06:25.920 --> 06:27.680
chickens appeared.

06:27.680 --> 06:28.680
Okay now?

06:28.680 --> 06:33.840
No, it's never that easy when you're trying to explain something to a creationist playacting

06:33.840 --> 06:35.400
the part of an atheist.

06:35.400 --> 06:40.880
Okay, actually what really happened is the chicken and the egg both came at the same

06:40.880 --> 06:42.240
time.

06:42.240 --> 06:45.840
They evolved from fish and fish eggs.

06:45.840 --> 06:50.320
Oh, which one came first, the fish or the fish egg?

06:50.320 --> 06:51.320
The fish.

06:51.320 --> 06:53.360
The fish come from fish eggs.

06:53.360 --> 06:57.080
Oh, wait a minute, the egg.

06:57.080 --> 06:59.600
But fish eggs come from fish.

06:59.600 --> 07:03.720
This could very well be the stupidest person on the face of the earth.

07:03.720 --> 07:09.120
Look, Mohan, as I've explained, the oldest egg fossils are over 500 million years old.

07:09.120 --> 07:11.380
That's long before they were even fish.

07:11.380 --> 07:14.440
So you can take your argument further back to the Cambrian.

07:14.440 --> 07:19.340
Or further still to when one cell entered another cell and shared DNA, creating the

07:19.380 --> 07:24.780
first proto-egg, and then ask which came first, the bacterium or the egg, in which case it

07:24.780 --> 07:26.420
was the bacterium.

07:26.420 --> 07:30.660
And then you can ask where bacteria come from, and I'd refer you to my video The Origin of

07:30.660 --> 07:32.700
Life Made Easy.

07:32.700 --> 07:38.100
Eggs have evolved alongside the organisms that carry them, so asking which evolved first

07:38.100 --> 07:42.820
is rather like asking which came first, the human or the human ear.

07:42.820 --> 07:46.420
So I guess this means that one of them had to be created.

07:46.500 --> 07:51.220
No, it means that you didn't bother to look up the answer, which in this day and age takes

07:51.220 --> 07:54.020
no more than a few clicks of the mouse.

07:54.020 --> 07:59.220
Now which came first is a fair question when asked by a six-year-old with a genuine inquiring

07:59.220 --> 08:00.220
mind.

08:00.220 --> 08:05.020
But this was a question asked in the arrogant belief that there's no possible answer.

08:05.020 --> 08:10.260
And what makes this nonsense doubly funny is that the video is called Atheism Destroyed

08:10.260 --> 08:12.000
with One Question.

08:12.000 --> 08:15.320
So Moan, you're a worthy winner of this year's bill.

08:15.320 --> 08:16.920
I mean, cock.
