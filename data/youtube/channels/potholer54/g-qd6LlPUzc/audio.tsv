0	12800	Before I look at the winner of this year's Coq, a word on the name.
12800	18000	The Coq is the Defiance in Ignorance prize for the dumbest question asked in the arrogant
18000	20760	belief that there's no possible answer.
20760	25400	It was originally called the Stone Commander prize, named after the guy who asked why all
25400	26880	the planets are round.
26880	31500	But Stone Commander later retracted his question and apologised for the rather aggressive way
31500	36840	in which he had phrased it, so I had to rename the prize, and it was called the Coq after
36840	40240	a YouTuber who won it the following year.
40240	45240	But then the YouTuber, Coq, real name Andy, released a video in which he recanted his
45240	46240	faith.
46240	50280	Sorry, I am no longer a Christian because I don't want to be in that club.
50280	51520	Two in a row.
51520	56580	The Defiance in Ignorance prize seems to have that kind of reverse Road to Damascus effect
56580	59000	on those on whom it's bestowed.
59000	63340	In view of Andy's conversion, I was going to rename the prize yet again, and according
63340	69180	to tradition, name it after the last recipient not to recant his beliefs, in other words,
69180	70460	the Bill.
70460	74940	But then Andy released a video that shows he's not ready to relinquish the title just
74940	75940	yet.
75940	76940	Sorry, Bill.
76940	78580	The fucking thing sucks!
78580	79580	Billy!
79580	81580	Now sit and watch Andy's video nicely.
81580	87580	How comes when I eat a banana it doesn't poison me?
87580	92520	If evolution is true, and the survival of the fittest, and all that kind of thing is
92520	100780	going on, then how comes when I munch into this nice, I suppose juicy really, this nice
100780	102940	firm banana, it's not going to kill me?
102940	103940	So that's it.
103940	107100	If evolution is true, why aren't bananas poisonous?
107100	112780	It's rather like asking, if evolution is true, how come monkeys can breathe?
112780	117140	Now before you start wondering whether Andy has won the cock yet again, let me point out
117140	121200	that, dumb as his question is, there is one that's better.
121200	123580	So he's not this year's recipient.
123580	127500	But his question does show that the prize is still deserving of his name.
127500	132260	The penis, not a very nice word, an embarrassing word.
132260	134500	Yes, but you chose it, Andy.
134500	137380	So the prize remains named in your honour.
137380	141580	And just to show how dumb your question was in the defiant belief that there's no possible
141580	147300	answer, let me explain why bananas don't poison people who eat them, and don't want to poison
147300	149020	people who eat them.
149020	153900	And I'll start with the response I gave to Ray Comfort, who was also fixated with bananas.
153900	156500	Behold, the atheist's nightmare.
156500	157500	Yeah!
157500	164860	Okay, that's enough, Ray.
164860	169140	As I pointed out, the modern banana has been cultivated over thousands of years, and it's
169140	173100	descended from an ancestor that was chock full of seeds.
173100	174740	That's what makes it a fruit.
174740	176820	More specifically, a berry.
176820	181620	And all fruits are edible, if not by us, then by other birds or animals.
181620	184860	They have to be in order to propagate the species.
184860	187820	So why does Andy think fruits ought to be poisonous?
187820	194620	If evolution were true, and a survival of the fittest, why has not the banana tree or
194620	200780	the apple tree or the orange tree, the limes and lemons, and the plums and all the other
200780	207400	fruit trees and other fruit plants as well, how come they have not evolved some kind of
207400	211860	a mechanism to repel people like me from eating bananas?
211860	214020	Let's try another analogy, Andy.
214100	218580	Asking why fruit or berries haven't evolved some mechanism to stop animals eating them
218580	222860	is like asking why women haven't developed some mechanism to stop men wanting to have
222860	224220	sex with them.
224220	229040	Why flowers haven't developed some mechanism to stop bees taking their pollen.
229040	233840	You do understand that the whole purpose of a fruit or a berry is to encourage its consumption
233840	235940	by animals, right?
235940	238460	Okay, obviously this is a little hard.
238460	243500	Let's get Tonto in to explain the whole thing in just 29 words of one syllable.
268460	281980	Bear poop seed in woods, new tree grow, get it, cock?
281980	286060	So it looks like the cock will have to keep its name until Andy's conversion into the
286060	288260	world of reality is complete.
288260	292900	But now let's unveil the face of this year's real winner from behind the trashy redneck
292900	294260	curtain.
294260	296640	This is a YouTuber called Moanne.
296640	301000	Now in case you don't get what you're about to see, Moanne plays two roles in the following
301000	302520	video clip.
302520	306520	Normally he shows the intelligent face of a creationist, but when he wants to portray
306520	312040	an atheist he uses his incomparable acting skills to completely transform his appearance
312040	313720	into someone stupid.
313720	314720	Like this.
314720	317960	I know, hard to believe it's the same person.
317960	323360	Dumb atheist, smart creationist, smart creationist, dumb atheist.
323360	324360	All clear?
324360	326080	Okay then, on to the question.
326080	328880	Excuse me, Mr. Atheist, you believe in evolution.
328880	334000	And even though it's okay to believe in evolution and God at the same time, I just have a question
334000	335080	for you.
335080	338360	What came first, the chicken or the egg?
338360	339360	The egg.
339360	343440	Well, I guess the chicken came first, yeah.
343440	344440	The chicken.
344440	345440	No, the egg.
345440	346640	But chickens come from eggs.
346640	351040	Oh, um, well, I guess the egg came first.
351040	352280	Yeah, the egg.
352280	353280	That's what I said.
353280	354960	But eggs come from chickens.
354960	360560	No, eggs come from just about every reproductive animal, they're not exclusive to chickens.
360560	365320	The oldest egg fossils that have been found date back to the Cambrian, over 500 million
365320	366920	years ago.
366920	371000	Before fish, before reptiles, and long before chickens.
371000	376720	Chickens didn't turn up in the fossil record until fairly recently on the geological timescale.
376720	380840	Even if you only want to look at eggs with a yolk and a hard shell that get sat on in
380840	385920	a nest, they were laid by the ancestors of chickens hundreds of millions of years before
385920	387680	chickens appeared.
387680	388680	Okay now?
388680	393840	No, it's never that easy when you're trying to explain something to a creationist playacting
393840	395400	the part of an atheist.
395400	400880	Okay, actually what really happened is the chicken and the egg both came at the same
400880	402240	time.
402240	405840	They evolved from fish and fish eggs.
405840	410320	Oh, which one came first, the fish or the fish egg?
410320	411320	The fish.
411320	413360	The fish come from fish eggs.
413360	417080	Oh, wait a minute, the egg.
417080	419600	But fish eggs come from fish.
419600	423720	This could very well be the stupidest person on the face of the earth.
423720	429120	Look, Mohan, as I've explained, the oldest egg fossils are over 500 million years old.
429120	431380	That's long before they were even fish.
431380	434440	So you can take your argument further back to the Cambrian.
434440	439340	Or further still to when one cell entered another cell and shared DNA, creating the
439380	444780	first proto-egg, and then ask which came first, the bacterium or the egg, in which case it
444780	446420	was the bacterium.
446420	450660	And then you can ask where bacteria come from, and I'd refer you to my video The Origin of
450660	452700	Life Made Easy.
452700	458100	Eggs have evolved alongside the organisms that carry them, so asking which evolved first
458100	462820	is rather like asking which came first, the human or the human ear.
462820	466420	So I guess this means that one of them had to be created.
466500	471220	No, it means that you didn't bother to look up the answer, which in this day and age takes
471220	474020	no more than a few clicks of the mouse.
474020	479220	Now which came first is a fair question when asked by a six-year-old with a genuine inquiring
479220	480220	mind.
480220	485020	But this was a question asked in the arrogant belief that there's no possible answer.
485020	490260	And what makes this nonsense doubly funny is that the video is called Atheism Destroyed
490260	492000	with One Question.
492000	495320	So Moan, you're a worthy winner of this year's bill.
495320	496920	I mean, cock.
