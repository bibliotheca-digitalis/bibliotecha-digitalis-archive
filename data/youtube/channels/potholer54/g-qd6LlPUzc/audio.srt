1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:12,800
Before I look at the winner of this year's Coq, a word on the name.

2
00:00:12,800 --> 00:00:18,000
The Coq is the Defiance in Ignorance prize for the dumbest question asked in the arrogant

3
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:20,760
belief that there's no possible answer.

4
00:00:20,760 --> 00:00:25,400
It was originally called the Stone Commander prize, named after the guy who asked why all

5
00:00:25,400 --> 00:00:26,880
the planets are round.

6
00:00:26,880 --> 00:00:31,500
But Stone Commander later retracted his question and apologised for the rather aggressive way

7
00:00:31,500 --> 00:00:36,840
in which he had phrased it, so I had to rename the prize, and it was called the Coq after

8
00:00:36,840 --> 00:00:40,240
a YouTuber who won it the following year.

9
00:00:40,240 --> 00:00:45,240
But then the YouTuber, Coq, real name Andy, released a video in which he recanted his

10
00:00:45,240 --> 00:00:46,240
faith.

11
00:00:46,240 --> 00:00:50,280
Sorry, I am no longer a Christian because I don't want to be in that club.

12
00:00:50,280 --> 00:00:51,520
Two in a row.

13
00:00:51,520 --> 00:00:56,580
The Defiance in Ignorance prize seems to have that kind of reverse Road to Damascus effect

14
00:00:56,580 --> 00:00:59,000
on those on whom it's bestowed.

15
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:03,340
In view of Andy's conversion, I was going to rename the prize yet again, and according

16
00:01:03,340 --> 00:01:09,180
to tradition, name it after the last recipient not to recant his beliefs, in other words,

17
00:01:09,180 --> 00:01:10,460
the Bill.

18
00:01:10,460 --> 00:01:14,940
But then Andy released a video that shows he's not ready to relinquish the title just

19
00:01:14,940 --> 00:01:15,940
yet.

20
00:01:15,940 --> 00:01:16,940
Sorry, Bill.

21
00:01:16,940 --> 00:01:18,580
The fucking thing sucks!

22
00:01:18,580 --> 00:01:19,580
Billy!

23
00:01:19,580 --> 00:01:21,580
Now sit and watch Andy's video nicely.

24
00:01:21,580 --> 00:01:27,580
How comes when I eat a banana it doesn't poison me?

25
00:01:27,580 --> 00:01:32,520
If evolution is true, and the survival of the fittest, and all that kind of thing is

26
00:01:32,520 --> 00:01:40,780
going on, then how comes when I munch into this nice, I suppose juicy really, this nice

27
00:01:40,780 --> 00:01:42,940
firm banana, it's not going to kill me?

28
00:01:42,940 --> 00:01:43,940
So that's it.

29
00:01:43,940 --> 00:01:47,100
If evolution is true, why aren't bananas poisonous?

30
00:01:47,100 --> 00:01:52,780
It's rather like asking, if evolution is true, how come monkeys can breathe?

31
00:01:52,780 --> 00:01:57,140
Now before you start wondering whether Andy has won the cock yet again, let me point out

32
00:01:57,140 --> 00:02:01,200
that, dumb as his question is, there is one that's better.

33
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:03,580
So he's not this year's recipient.

34
00:02:03,580 --> 00:02:07,500
But his question does show that the prize is still deserving of his name.

35
00:02:07,500 --> 00:02:12,260
The penis, not a very nice word, an embarrassing word.

36
00:02:12,260 --> 00:02:14,500
Yes, but you chose it, Andy.

37
00:02:14,500 --> 00:02:17,380
So the prize remains named in your honour.

38
00:02:17,380 --> 00:02:21,580
And just to show how dumb your question was in the defiant belief that there's no possible

39
00:02:21,580 --> 00:02:27,300
answer, let me explain why bananas don't poison people who eat them, and don't want to poison

40
00:02:27,300 --> 00:02:29,020
people who eat them.

41
00:02:29,020 --> 00:02:33,900
And I'll start with the response I gave to Ray Comfort, who was also fixated with bananas.

42
00:02:33,900 --> 00:02:36,500
Behold, the atheist's nightmare.

43
00:02:36,500 --> 00:02:37,500
Yeah!

44
00:02:37,500 --> 00:02:44,860
Okay, that's enough, Ray.

45
00:02:44,860 --> 00:02:49,140
As I pointed out, the modern banana has been cultivated over thousands of years, and it's

46
00:02:49,140 --> 00:02:53,100
descended from an ancestor that was chock full of seeds.

47
00:02:53,100 --> 00:02:54,740
That's what makes it a fruit.

48
00:02:54,740 --> 00:02:56,820
More specifically, a berry.

49
00:02:56,820 --> 00:03:01,620
And all fruits are edible, if not by us, then by other birds or animals.

50
00:03:01,620 --> 00:03:04,860
They have to be in order to propagate the species.

51
00:03:04,860 --> 00:03:07,820
So why does Andy think fruits ought to be poisonous?

52
00:03:07,820 --> 00:03:14,620
If evolution were true, and a survival of the fittest, why has not the banana tree or

53
00:03:14,620 --> 00:03:20,780
the apple tree or the orange tree, the limes and lemons, and the plums and all the other

54
00:03:20,780 --> 00:03:27,400
fruit trees and other fruit plants as well, how come they have not evolved some kind of

55
00:03:27,400 --> 00:03:31,860
a mechanism to repel people like me from eating bananas?

56
00:03:31,860 --> 00:03:34,020
Let's try another analogy, Andy.

57
00:03:34,100 --> 00:03:38,580
Asking why fruit or berries haven't evolved some mechanism to stop animals eating them

58
00:03:38,580 --> 00:03:42,860
is like asking why women haven't developed some mechanism to stop men wanting to have

59
00:03:42,860 --> 00:03:44,220
sex with them.

60
00:03:44,220 --> 00:03:49,040
Why flowers haven't developed some mechanism to stop bees taking their pollen.

61
00:03:49,040 --> 00:03:53,840
You do understand that the whole purpose of a fruit or a berry is to encourage its consumption

62
00:03:53,840 --> 00:03:55,940
by animals, right?

63
00:03:55,940 --> 00:03:58,460
Okay, obviously this is a little hard.

64
00:03:58,460 --> 00:04:03,500
Let's get Tonto in to explain the whole thing in just 29 words of one syllable.

65
00:04:28,460 --> 00:04:41,980
Bear poop seed in woods, new tree grow, get it, cock?

66
00:04:41,980 --> 00:04:46,060
So it looks like the cock will have to keep its name until Andy's conversion into the

67
00:04:46,060 --> 00:04:48,260
world of reality is complete.

68
00:04:48,260 --> 00:04:52,900
But now let's unveil the face of this year's real winner from behind the trashy redneck

69
00:04:52,900 --> 00:04:54,260
curtain.

70
00:04:54,260 --> 00:04:56,640
This is a YouTuber called Moanne.

71
00:04:56,640 --> 00:05:01,000
Now in case you don't get what you're about to see, Moanne plays two roles in the following

72
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:02,520
video clip.

73
00:05:02,520 --> 00:05:06,520
Normally he shows the intelligent face of a creationist, but when he wants to portray

74
00:05:06,520 --> 00:05:12,040
an atheist he uses his incomparable acting skills to completely transform his appearance

75
00:05:12,040 --> 00:05:13,720
into someone stupid.

76
00:05:13,720 --> 00:05:14,720
Like this.

77
00:05:14,720 --> 00:05:17,960
I know, hard to believe it's the same person.

78
00:05:17,960 --> 00:05:23,360
Dumb atheist, smart creationist, smart creationist, dumb atheist.

79
00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:24,360
All clear?

80
00:05:24,360 --> 00:05:26,080
Okay then, on to the question.

81
00:05:26,080 --> 00:05:28,880
Excuse me, Mr. Atheist, you believe in evolution.

82
00:05:28,880 --> 00:05:34,000
And even though it's okay to believe in evolution and God at the same time, I just have a question

83
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:35,080
for you.

84
00:05:35,080 --> 00:05:38,360
What came first, the chicken or the egg?

85
00:05:38,360 --> 00:05:39,360
The egg.

86
00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:43,440
Well, I guess the chicken came first, yeah.

87
00:05:43,440 --> 00:05:44,440
The chicken.

88
00:05:44,440 --> 00:05:45,440
No, the egg.

89
00:05:45,440 --> 00:05:46,640
But chickens come from eggs.

90
00:05:46,640 --> 00:05:51,040
Oh, um, well, I guess the egg came first.

91
00:05:51,040 --> 00:05:52,280
Yeah, the egg.

92
00:05:52,280 --> 00:05:53,280
That's what I said.

93
00:05:53,280 --> 00:05:54,960
But eggs come from chickens.

94
00:05:54,960 --> 00:06:00,560
No, eggs come from just about every reproductive animal, they're not exclusive to chickens.

95
00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:05,320
The oldest egg fossils that have been found date back to the Cambrian, over 500 million

96
00:06:05,320 --> 00:06:06,920
years ago.

97
00:06:06,920 --> 00:06:11,000
Before fish, before reptiles, and long before chickens.

98
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:16,720
Chickens didn't turn up in the fossil record until fairly recently on the geological timescale.

99
00:06:16,720 --> 00:06:20,840
Even if you only want to look at eggs with a yolk and a hard shell that get sat on in

100
00:06:20,840 --> 00:06:25,920
a nest, they were laid by the ancestors of chickens hundreds of millions of years before

101
00:06:25,920 --> 00:06:27,680
chickens appeared.

102
00:06:27,680 --> 00:06:28,680
Okay now?

103
00:06:28,680 --> 00:06:33,840
No, it's never that easy when you're trying to explain something to a creationist playacting

104
00:06:33,840 --> 00:06:35,400
the part of an atheist.

105
00:06:35,400 --> 00:06:40,880
Okay, actually what really happened is the chicken and the egg both came at the same

106
00:06:40,880 --> 00:06:42,240
time.

107
00:06:42,240 --> 00:06:45,840
They evolved from fish and fish eggs.

108
00:06:45,840 --> 00:06:50,320
Oh, which one came first, the fish or the fish egg?

109
00:06:50,320 --> 00:06:51,320
The fish.

110
00:06:51,320 --> 00:06:53,360
The fish come from fish eggs.

111
00:06:53,360 --> 00:06:57,080
Oh, wait a minute, the egg.

112
00:06:57,080 --> 00:06:59,600
But fish eggs come from fish.

113
00:06:59,600 --> 00:07:03,720
This could very well be the stupidest person on the face of the earth.

114
00:07:03,720 --> 00:07:09,120
Look, Mohan, as I've explained, the oldest egg fossils are over 500 million years old.

115
00:07:09,120 --> 00:07:11,380
That's long before they were even fish.

116
00:07:11,380 --> 00:07:14,440
So you can take your argument further back to the Cambrian.

117
00:07:14,440 --> 00:07:19,340
Or further still to when one cell entered another cell and shared DNA, creating the

118
00:07:19,380 --> 00:07:24,780
first proto-egg, and then ask which came first, the bacterium or the egg, in which case it

119
00:07:24,780 --> 00:07:26,420
was the bacterium.

120
00:07:26,420 --> 00:07:30,660
And then you can ask where bacteria come from, and I'd refer you to my video The Origin of

121
00:07:30,660 --> 00:07:32,700
Life Made Easy.

122
00:07:32,700 --> 00:07:38,100
Eggs have evolved alongside the organisms that carry them, so asking which evolved first

123
00:07:38,100 --> 00:07:42,820
is rather like asking which came first, the human or the human ear.

124
00:07:42,820 --> 00:07:46,420
So I guess this means that one of them had to be created.

125
00:07:46,500 --> 00:07:51,220
No, it means that you didn't bother to look up the answer, which in this day and age takes

126
00:07:51,220 --> 00:07:54,020
no more than a few clicks of the mouse.

127
00:07:54,020 --> 00:07:59,220
Now which came first is a fair question when asked by a six-year-old with a genuine inquiring

128
00:07:59,220 --> 00:08:00,220
mind.

129
00:08:00,220 --> 00:08:05,020
But this was a question asked in the arrogant belief that there's no possible answer.

130
00:08:05,020 --> 00:08:10,260
And what makes this nonsense doubly funny is that the video is called Atheism Destroyed

131
00:08:10,260 --> 00:08:12,000
with One Question.

132
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:15,320
So Moan, you're a worthy winner of this year's bill.

133
00:08:15,320 --> 00:08:16,920
I mean, cock.
