1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:14,600
I know, I know, hard to believe that in the 21st century we have to debunk this Bronze

2
00:00:14,600 --> 00:00:15,920
Age myth.

3
00:00:15,920 --> 00:00:20,560
But while most of us left the story of a global flood and an ark full of animals back in Sunday

4
00:00:20,560 --> 00:00:26,880
school for five-year-olds, 64% of Americans surveyed four years ago actually believe this

5
00:00:26,880 --> 00:00:28,520
story is true.

6
00:00:28,520 --> 00:00:33,320
And grown-ups with proper jobs have even tried to explain how it could have happened.

7
00:00:33,320 --> 00:00:37,520
So in the next two videos I'm going to explain how we know it didn't happen.

8
00:00:37,520 --> 00:00:40,900
And then we'll take a look at some of the famous mini-myths that have grown up around

9
00:00:40,900 --> 00:00:46,660
the flood story, like polystrat trees and the five-minute carving of the Grand Canyon.

10
00:00:46,660 --> 00:00:51,600
Two hundred years ago the first geologists believed absolutely what the Bible told them,

11
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:55,220
and set forth to find traces of this great flood.

12
00:00:55,220 --> 00:00:58,780
The view of the world was pretty much the same as creationists today.

13
00:00:58,780 --> 00:01:03,500
God had made the earth, mostly out of granite and basalt, then along came the flood, bearing

14
00:01:03,500 --> 00:01:08,040
and preserving all the animals and plants under a mass of muddy sediment.

15
00:01:08,040 --> 00:01:13,500
Then life returned, the soil was built up, and today we live on top of all these remains.

16
00:01:13,500 --> 00:01:17,940
And if you listen to creationists on this subject, this is exactly what geologists have

17
00:01:17,940 --> 00:01:18,940
found.

18
00:01:18,940 --> 00:01:22,780
When you have billions and billions of dead things and rocks laid down by water all over

19
00:01:22,780 --> 00:01:30,400
the world, I think you've got a pretty strong argument for catastrophic judgement.

20
00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:34,540
But when early geologists looked at these water-laying rocks more closely, they got

21
00:01:34,540 --> 00:01:38,340
a surprise, because they didn't find this at all.

22
00:01:38,340 --> 00:01:41,220
They found something more like this.

23
00:01:41,220 --> 00:01:46,100
Distinct layers of different types of rock in no particular order.

24
00:01:46,100 --> 00:01:50,200
No sign of that single global flood deposit anywhere.

25
00:01:50,280 --> 00:01:52,600
And Hovind pretends not to be surprised.

26
00:01:52,600 --> 00:01:55,960
He says we should get layers of sediment from a flood.

27
00:01:55,960 --> 00:01:57,960
Moving mud automatically stratifies.

28
00:01:57,960 --> 00:02:01,200
Get a jar of dirt, add some water to it, shake it up, and set it down.

29
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:03,700
It settles into layers for you.

30
00:02:03,700 --> 00:02:08,200
This is an important part of what Hovind calls the Hovind Theory.

31
00:02:08,200 --> 00:02:22,280
Yeah, he seems to have dreamed it up by sitting in a chair, because as we shall see, it's

32
00:02:22,280 --> 00:02:27,120
obvious Hovind hasn't actually done the experiment to find out what happens.

33
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:28,640
Let's do it for him.

34
00:02:28,640 --> 00:02:33,560
To test the Hovind Theory, add different flood detritus to a jar or a small tank.

35
00:02:33,560 --> 00:02:39,720
A few stones, some sand, red clay, weathered clay, humus-rich garden soil, natural topsoil

36
00:02:39,720 --> 00:02:42,360
from the forest, and a bit of vegetation.

37
00:02:42,360 --> 00:02:44,520
Add water and stir.

38
00:02:44,520 --> 00:02:51,400
Let's leave it to settle for a bit and look at more of the Hovind Theory.

39
00:02:51,400 --> 00:02:55,520
When you go down into the canyons near Mount St. Helens, you will see erosion, it was incredible

40
00:02:55,520 --> 00:03:00,680
there, and it has, the sides of the canyon are stratified, nice neat layers.

41
00:03:00,680 --> 00:03:04,840
They say, now wait a minute, all this mud flowed in here at one time, why is it stratified?

42
00:03:04,840 --> 00:03:06,800
Did Hovind just say this was mud?

43
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:08,840
Wait a minute, all this mud flowed in here at one time.

44
00:03:08,840 --> 00:03:12,800
But this didn't look like a mud flow to me, and I've seen quite a few.

45
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:17,120
Knowing that Hovind is predisposed to lying through his teeth, I tracked down the picture

46
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:20,760
to a website called wasdarwinright.com.

47
00:03:20,760 --> 00:03:25,000
It had been reversed, but it's the same photo, and this photo shows much more clearly the

48
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:29,920
obvious features of ash deposits and pyroclastic flow from a volcano.

49
00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:31,920
The caption on the photo confirms it.

50
00:03:31,920 --> 00:03:38,080
It says the bottom layer formed on May the 18th, 1980, and the middle one a month later.

51
00:03:38,080 --> 00:03:43,200
So not only are these two separate layers, both dates coincide with eruptions of pyroclasts

52
00:03:43,200 --> 00:03:47,080
from Mount St. Helens, not mud flows.

53
00:03:47,080 --> 00:03:51,560
Pyroclast is basically particulate matter ejected from a volcano, as distinct from gas

54
00:03:51,560 --> 00:03:53,340
and lava.

55
00:03:53,340 --> 00:03:58,800
Only the top layer is identified in the caption as a mud flow, and one that occurred two years

56
00:03:58,800 --> 00:03:59,800
later.

57
00:03:59,800 --> 00:04:05,720
Not only did they not form at one time, as Hovind claims, they're not even flood deposits.

58
00:04:05,720 --> 00:04:07,220
Why is this important?

59
00:04:07,220 --> 00:04:12,000
Or to put it another way, why is it important enough for Hovind to want to lie about it?

60
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:16,700
Well creationists are using Mount St. Helens to argue that a single sedimentary event can

61
00:04:16,700 --> 00:04:21,400
form distinctive layers, and therefore a global flood could have done the same.

62
00:04:21,400 --> 00:04:26,240
But as we've seen, Mount St. Helens was a series of separate events, most of which were

63
00:04:26,240 --> 00:04:29,180
volcanic and not flood related.

64
00:04:29,180 --> 00:04:33,000
A single flood doesn't produce separate layers of different material.

65
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:36,500
It produces a single layer, a graded material.

66
00:04:36,500 --> 00:04:42,140
I'll let Hovind prove my point by going back to the experiment he obviously never performed.

67
00:04:42,140 --> 00:04:46,260
Here's the tank again a day later, and we can count the number of layers it settled

68
00:04:46,260 --> 00:04:48,260
into.

69
00:04:48,260 --> 00:04:50,020
One.

70
00:04:50,020 --> 00:04:54,020
What you get in this single layer is just a textbook example of what's called graded

71
00:04:54,020 --> 00:04:55,020
bedding.

72
00:04:55,380 --> 00:04:59,340
Coarser grains and heavy gravels tend to be found at the bottom, and smaller and lighter

73
00:04:59,340 --> 00:05:03,380
material like silts and muds are generally found nearer the top.

74
00:05:03,380 --> 00:05:07,500
It may look as though there are two or three separate layers here, but on closer inspection

75
00:05:07,500 --> 00:05:12,360
you can see the different grain sizes and the blurring of the boundaries.

76
00:05:12,360 --> 00:05:17,160
What you don't get are what we see in rocks all around us, clearly defined sedimentary

77
00:05:17,160 --> 00:05:21,700
layers each made of different material and in no particular order.

78
00:05:21,700 --> 00:05:25,500
This photo shows a layer of red limestone topped by chalk.

79
00:05:25,500 --> 00:05:30,320
So if Hovind's flood experiment spectacularly fails to recreate these separate layers, what

80
00:05:30,320 --> 00:05:32,140
would do it?

81
00:05:32,140 --> 00:05:36,020
Well let's add the same materials again, this time recreating the kind of conditions

82
00:05:36,020 --> 00:05:38,340
we see on Earth today.

83
00:05:38,340 --> 00:05:42,100
First sprinkle some mud to replicate what we see laid down in swampy areas or in the

84
00:05:42,100 --> 00:05:44,540
estuaries of silt-rich rivers.

85
00:05:44,540 --> 00:05:49,460
Then the sort of sand that today is being deposited offshore near more arid environments.

86
00:05:49,460 --> 00:05:53,740
Next we'll add a thin layer of topsoil to represent rapid erosion, then coarse sand

87
00:05:53,740 --> 00:05:58,140
and grit to replicate what we see today being deposited in some deltas.

88
00:05:58,140 --> 00:06:02,260
And finally a layer of larger stones to represent a conglomerate.

89
00:06:02,260 --> 00:06:07,700
And presto, we've recreated the layering we see in the rocks all around us.

90
00:06:07,700 --> 00:06:12,260
None of this is magic, I'm just recreating the kind of deposition we see in different

91
00:06:12,260 --> 00:06:14,960
environments all over the world today.

92
00:06:14,960 --> 00:06:19,280
And it fits perfectly with the distinct layering of separate materials we see in the rocks

93
00:06:19,280 --> 00:06:20,840
all around us.

94
00:06:20,840 --> 00:06:23,840
Hovind's experiment clearly doesn't.

95
00:06:23,840 --> 00:06:28,480
Now you could argue that God could have deliberately separated out all the grains and put each

96
00:06:28,480 --> 00:06:33,100
one into different layers to make it look as though there was never any flood.

97
00:06:33,100 --> 00:06:38,080
Or maybe, but the layering isn't the only thing that creationists have to contend with.

98
00:06:38,080 --> 00:06:40,200
Let's go back to Mount St Helens.

99
00:06:40,200 --> 00:06:43,920
Another reason it's used as an argument for the great flood is because it proves that

100
00:06:43,920 --> 00:06:46,960
sediments can be deposited quickly.

101
00:06:47,160 --> 00:06:52,180
No surprise there, and no need to go all the way to Mount St Helens to find that out.

102
00:06:52,180 --> 00:06:56,460
This has been in the geology textbooks for the last 150 years.

103
00:06:56,460 --> 00:07:01,920
We know that some sedimentary material like pyroclast, flood deposit and breccia is deposited

104
00:07:01,920 --> 00:07:03,440
very rapidly.

105
00:07:03,440 --> 00:07:08,160
But to argue that all sediments are therefore deposited quickly is nonsense.

106
00:07:08,160 --> 00:07:11,140
In fact we know they aren't.

107
00:07:11,140 --> 00:07:12,660
Take chalk for example.

108
00:07:12,660 --> 00:07:16,940
It's made of the shells of trillions of marine algae called coccolithophores.

109
00:07:16,940 --> 00:07:21,580
As these organisms die their shell plates, called coccoliths, fall to the bottom of the

110
00:07:21,580 --> 00:07:26,220
sea and accumulate, building up a layer of chalk at a rate of up to two inches every

111
00:07:26,220 --> 00:07:27,900
thousand years.

112
00:07:27,900 --> 00:07:30,660
We can see it happening today and measure it.

113
00:07:30,660 --> 00:07:33,420
And here's the result of it happening in the past.

114
00:07:33,420 --> 00:07:38,780
In different parts of the world we find chalk beds hundreds of feet thick.

115
00:07:38,780 --> 00:07:43,540
What you're hearing is the sound of creationists rushing to answersingenesis.com to find out

116
00:07:43,540 --> 00:07:46,020
what they're supposed to think about all this.

117
00:07:46,020 --> 00:07:50,760
Well answers in Genesis suggest that somehow the algae proliferated during the 150 days

118
00:07:50,760 --> 00:07:55,220
of the flood because they got more nutrients from all the flood detritus.

119
00:07:55,220 --> 00:08:00,640
So instead of making just one inch of chalk in 150 days their rate of deposition suddenly

120
00:08:00,640 --> 00:08:07,160
increased 18 million times and they made all this over 1,000 feet thick.

121
00:08:07,160 --> 00:08:11,840
But even if that was chemically possible and didn't break all the laws of thermodynamics

122
00:08:11,840 --> 00:08:17,080
it doesn't explain why none of that flood detritus got mixed up with the chalk.

123
00:08:17,080 --> 00:08:20,460
Fossilised coral represents another problem for the flood story.

124
00:08:20,460 --> 00:08:23,120
It's obviously not a flood deposit.

125
00:08:23,120 --> 00:08:27,520
Yet we find layers of coral sandwiched between what are supposed to be flood deposits.

126
00:08:27,520 --> 00:08:30,600
We even find layers of coal above the coral.

127
00:08:30,600 --> 00:08:34,880
If we accept the creationist's idea that coal seams are ancient forests that got buried

128
00:08:34,880 --> 00:08:39,200
by the flood what are they doing sitting on top of coral reefs?

129
00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:42,380
Was there an earlier global flood that we don't know about?

130
00:08:42,380 --> 00:08:46,680
So while billions of dead things in sediment laid down by water may seem to be all we've

131
00:08:46,680 --> 00:08:53,000
got under our feet a more detailed and intelligent examination of the rocks shows a very different

132
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:54,000
story.

133
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:59,000
These rocks present no great mystery for geologists because they're made of exactly the same sediments

134
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:03,600
being laid down in different environments today from the slow deposition of chalk and

135
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:09,000
limestone to the rapid deposition caused by local floods and mudslides to the steady

136
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:11,920
build-up of sandstones and siltstones.

137
00:09:11,920 --> 00:09:15,880
If creationists like Hovind prefer to sit in their armchairs and make up what they call

138
00:09:15,880 --> 00:09:20,720
theories then there's a very easy way for them to support their case.

139
00:09:20,720 --> 00:09:24,920
Perform experiments to show that an increase in detritus will increase the population of

140
00:09:24,920 --> 00:09:27,560
coccoliths 18 million times.

141
00:09:27,560 --> 00:09:31,840
Instead of telling gullible audiences that an experiment will confirm the flood theory

142
00:09:31,840 --> 00:09:37,560
do the experiment and show how a mix of sand, silt, mud, shells and grit will miraculously

143
00:09:37,560 --> 00:09:39,720
separate into different layers.

144
00:09:39,720 --> 00:09:46,200
No it's no good going to AnswersinGenesis.com they've never done the experiment.

145
00:09:46,200 --> 00:09:50,240
The last thing you want to do when you've got a theory that's wrong is do an experiment

146
00:09:50,240 --> 00:09:52,000
that will prove it wrong.

147
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:57,280
But we live in the 21st century where we don't have to just accept these Bronze Age stories

148
00:09:57,280 --> 00:10:00,280
because Sunday school teachers tell us they're true.

149
00:10:00,280 --> 00:10:04,200
We're capable of thinking and finding out for ourselves.

150
00:10:04,200 --> 00:10:07,440
So that just about wraps it up for the waterborne sediments.

151
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:11,040
In the next video we'll look at the billions and billions of dead things.
