0	14600	I know, I know, hard to believe that in the 21st century we have to debunk this Bronze
14600	15920	Age myth.
15920	20560	But while most of us left the story of a global flood and an ark full of animals back in Sunday
20560	26880	school for five-year-olds, 64% of Americans surveyed four years ago actually believe this
26880	28520	story is true.
28520	33320	And grown-ups with proper jobs have even tried to explain how it could have happened.
33320	37520	So in the next two videos I'm going to explain how we know it didn't happen.
37520	40900	And then we'll take a look at some of the famous mini-myths that have grown up around
40900	46660	the flood story, like polystrat trees and the five-minute carving of the Grand Canyon.
46660	51600	Two hundred years ago the first geologists believed absolutely what the Bible told them,
51600	55220	and set forth to find traces of this great flood.
55220	58780	The view of the world was pretty much the same as creationists today.
58780	63500	God had made the earth, mostly out of granite and basalt, then along came the flood, bearing
63500	68040	and preserving all the animals and plants under a mass of muddy sediment.
68040	73500	Then life returned, the soil was built up, and today we live on top of all these remains.
73500	77940	And if you listen to creationists on this subject, this is exactly what geologists have
77940	78940	found.
78940	82780	When you have billions and billions of dead things and rocks laid down by water all over
82780	90400	the world, I think you've got a pretty strong argument for catastrophic judgement.
90400	94540	But when early geologists looked at these water-laying rocks more closely, they got
94540	98340	a surprise, because they didn't find this at all.
98340	101220	They found something more like this.
101220	106100	Distinct layers of different types of rock in no particular order.
106100	110200	No sign of that single global flood deposit anywhere.
110280	112600	And Hovind pretends not to be surprised.
112600	115960	He says we should get layers of sediment from a flood.
115960	117960	Moving mud automatically stratifies.
117960	121200	Get a jar of dirt, add some water to it, shake it up, and set it down.
121200	123700	It settles into layers for you.
123700	128200	This is an important part of what Hovind calls the Hovind Theory.
128200	142280	Yeah, he seems to have dreamed it up by sitting in a chair, because as we shall see, it's
142280	147120	obvious Hovind hasn't actually done the experiment to find out what happens.
147120	148640	Let's do it for him.
148640	153560	To test the Hovind Theory, add different flood detritus to a jar or a small tank.
153560	159720	A few stones, some sand, red clay, weathered clay, humus-rich garden soil, natural topsoil
159720	162360	from the forest, and a bit of vegetation.
162360	164520	Add water and stir.
164520	171400	Let's leave it to settle for a bit and look at more of the Hovind Theory.
171400	175520	When you go down into the canyons near Mount St. Helens, you will see erosion, it was incredible
175520	180680	there, and it has, the sides of the canyon are stratified, nice neat layers.
180680	184840	They say, now wait a minute, all this mud flowed in here at one time, why is it stratified?
184840	186800	Did Hovind just say this was mud?
186800	188840	Wait a minute, all this mud flowed in here at one time.
188840	192800	But this didn't look like a mud flow to me, and I've seen quite a few.
192800	197120	Knowing that Hovind is predisposed to lying through his teeth, I tracked down the picture
197120	200760	to a website called wasdarwinright.com.
200760	205000	It had been reversed, but it's the same photo, and this photo shows much more clearly the
205000	209920	obvious features of ash deposits and pyroclastic flow from a volcano.
209920	211920	The caption on the photo confirms it.
211920	218080	It says the bottom layer formed on May the 18th, 1980, and the middle one a month later.
218080	223200	So not only are these two separate layers, both dates coincide with eruptions of pyroclasts
223200	227080	from Mount St. Helens, not mud flows.
227080	231560	Pyroclast is basically particulate matter ejected from a volcano, as distinct from gas
231560	233340	and lava.
233340	238800	Only the top layer is identified in the caption as a mud flow, and one that occurred two years
238800	239800	later.
239800	245720	Not only did they not form at one time, as Hovind claims, they're not even flood deposits.
245720	247220	Why is this important?
247220	252000	Or to put it another way, why is it important enough for Hovind to want to lie about it?
252000	256700	Well creationists are using Mount St. Helens to argue that a single sedimentary event can
256700	261400	form distinctive layers, and therefore a global flood could have done the same.
261400	266240	But as we've seen, Mount St. Helens was a series of separate events, most of which were
266240	269180	volcanic and not flood related.
269180	273000	A single flood doesn't produce separate layers of different material.
273000	276500	It produces a single layer, a graded material.
276500	282140	I'll let Hovind prove my point by going back to the experiment he obviously never performed.
282140	286260	Here's the tank again a day later, and we can count the number of layers it settled
286260	288260	into.
288260	290020	One.
290020	294020	What you get in this single layer is just a textbook example of what's called graded
294020	295020	bedding.
295380	299340	Coarser grains and heavy gravels tend to be found at the bottom, and smaller and lighter
299340	303380	material like silts and muds are generally found nearer the top.
303380	307500	It may look as though there are two or three separate layers here, but on closer inspection
307500	312360	you can see the different grain sizes and the blurring of the boundaries.
312360	317160	What you don't get are what we see in rocks all around us, clearly defined sedimentary
317160	321700	layers each made of different material and in no particular order.
321700	325500	This photo shows a layer of red limestone topped by chalk.
325500	330320	So if Hovind's flood experiment spectacularly fails to recreate these separate layers, what
330320	332140	would do it?
332140	336020	Well let's add the same materials again, this time recreating the kind of conditions
336020	338340	we see on Earth today.
338340	342100	First sprinkle some mud to replicate what we see laid down in swampy areas or in the
342100	344540	estuaries of silt-rich rivers.
344540	349460	Then the sort of sand that today is being deposited offshore near more arid environments.
349460	353740	Next we'll add a thin layer of topsoil to represent rapid erosion, then coarse sand
353740	358140	and grit to replicate what we see today being deposited in some deltas.
358140	362260	And finally a layer of larger stones to represent a conglomerate.
362260	367700	And presto, we've recreated the layering we see in the rocks all around us.
367700	372260	None of this is magic, I'm just recreating the kind of deposition we see in different
372260	374960	environments all over the world today.
374960	379280	And it fits perfectly with the distinct layering of separate materials we see in the rocks
379280	380840	all around us.
380840	383840	Hovind's experiment clearly doesn't.
383840	388480	Now you could argue that God could have deliberately separated out all the grains and put each
388480	393100	one into different layers to make it look as though there was never any flood.
393100	398080	Or maybe, but the layering isn't the only thing that creationists have to contend with.
398080	400200	Let's go back to Mount St Helens.
400200	403920	Another reason it's used as an argument for the great flood is because it proves that
403920	406960	sediments can be deposited quickly.
407160	412180	No surprise there, and no need to go all the way to Mount St Helens to find that out.
412180	416460	This has been in the geology textbooks for the last 150 years.
416460	421920	We know that some sedimentary material like pyroclast, flood deposit and breccia is deposited
421920	423440	very rapidly.
423440	428160	But to argue that all sediments are therefore deposited quickly is nonsense.
428160	431140	In fact we know they aren't.
431140	432660	Take chalk for example.
432660	436940	It's made of the shells of trillions of marine algae called coccolithophores.
436940	441580	As these organisms die their shell plates, called coccoliths, fall to the bottom of the
441580	446220	sea and accumulate, building up a layer of chalk at a rate of up to two inches every
446220	447900	thousand years.
447900	450660	We can see it happening today and measure it.
450660	453420	And here's the result of it happening in the past.
453420	458780	In different parts of the world we find chalk beds hundreds of feet thick.
458780	463540	What you're hearing is the sound of creationists rushing to answersingenesis.com to find out
463540	466020	what they're supposed to think about all this.
466020	470760	Well answers in Genesis suggest that somehow the algae proliferated during the 150 days
470760	475220	of the flood because they got more nutrients from all the flood detritus.
475220	480640	So instead of making just one inch of chalk in 150 days their rate of deposition suddenly
480640	487160	increased 18 million times and they made all this over 1,000 feet thick.
487160	491840	But even if that was chemically possible and didn't break all the laws of thermodynamics
491840	497080	it doesn't explain why none of that flood detritus got mixed up with the chalk.
497080	500460	Fossilised coral represents another problem for the flood story.
500460	503120	It's obviously not a flood deposit.
503120	507520	Yet we find layers of coral sandwiched between what are supposed to be flood deposits.
507520	510600	We even find layers of coal above the coral.
510600	514880	If we accept the creationist's idea that coal seams are ancient forests that got buried
514880	519200	by the flood what are they doing sitting on top of coral reefs?
519200	522380	Was there an earlier global flood that we don't know about?
522380	526680	So while billions of dead things in sediment laid down by water may seem to be all we've
526680	533000	got under our feet a more detailed and intelligent examination of the rocks shows a very different
533000	534000	story.
534000	539000	These rocks present no great mystery for geologists because they're made of exactly the same sediments
539000	543600	being laid down in different environments today from the slow deposition of chalk and
543600	549000	limestone to the rapid deposition caused by local floods and mudslides to the steady
549000	551920	build-up of sandstones and siltstones.
551920	555880	If creationists like Hovind prefer to sit in their armchairs and make up what they call
555880	560720	theories then there's a very easy way for them to support their case.
560720	564920	Perform experiments to show that an increase in detritus will increase the population of
564920	567560	coccoliths 18 million times.
567560	571840	Instead of telling gullible audiences that an experiment will confirm the flood theory
571840	577560	do the experiment and show how a mix of sand, silt, mud, shells and grit will miraculously
577560	579720	separate into different layers.
579720	586200	No it's no good going to AnswersinGenesis.com they've never done the experiment.
586200	590240	The last thing you want to do when you've got a theory that's wrong is do an experiment
590240	592000	that will prove it wrong.
592000	597280	But we live in the 21st century where we don't have to just accept these Bronze Age stories
597280	600280	because Sunday school teachers tell us they're true.
600280	604200	We're capable of thinking and finding out for ourselves.
604200	607440	So that just about wraps it up for the waterborne sediments.
607440	611040	In the next video we'll look at the billions and billions of dead things.
