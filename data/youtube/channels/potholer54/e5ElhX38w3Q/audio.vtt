00:00.000 --> 00:14.600
I know, I know, hard to believe that in the 21st century we have to debunk this Bronze

00:14.600 --> 00:15.920
Age myth.

00:15.920 --> 00:20.560
But while most of us left the story of a global flood and an ark full of animals back in Sunday

00:20.560 --> 00:26.880
school for five-year-olds, 64% of Americans surveyed four years ago actually believe this

00:26.880 --> 00:28.520
story is true.

00:28.520 --> 00:33.320
And grown-ups with proper jobs have even tried to explain how it could have happened.

00:33.320 --> 00:37.520
So in the next two videos I'm going to explain how we know it didn't happen.

00:37.520 --> 00:40.900
And then we'll take a look at some of the famous mini-myths that have grown up around

00:40.900 --> 00:46.660
the flood story, like polystrat trees and the five-minute carving of the Grand Canyon.

00:46.660 --> 00:51.600
Two hundred years ago the first geologists believed absolutely what the Bible told them,

00:51.600 --> 00:55.220
and set forth to find traces of this great flood.

00:55.220 --> 00:58.780
The view of the world was pretty much the same as creationists today.

00:58.780 --> 01:03.500
God had made the earth, mostly out of granite and basalt, then along came the flood, bearing

01:03.500 --> 01:08.040
and preserving all the animals and plants under a mass of muddy sediment.

01:08.040 --> 01:13.500
Then life returned, the soil was built up, and today we live on top of all these remains.

01:13.500 --> 01:17.940
And if you listen to creationists on this subject, this is exactly what geologists have

01:17.940 --> 01:18.940
found.

01:18.940 --> 01:22.780
When you have billions and billions of dead things and rocks laid down by water all over

01:22.780 --> 01:30.400
the world, I think you've got a pretty strong argument for catastrophic judgement.

01:30.400 --> 01:34.540
But when early geologists looked at these water-laying rocks more closely, they got

01:34.540 --> 01:38.340
a surprise, because they didn't find this at all.

01:38.340 --> 01:41.220
They found something more like this.

01:41.220 --> 01:46.100
Distinct layers of different types of rock in no particular order.

01:46.100 --> 01:50.200
No sign of that single global flood deposit anywhere.

01:50.280 --> 01:52.600
And Hovind pretends not to be surprised.

01:52.600 --> 01:55.960
He says we should get layers of sediment from a flood.

01:55.960 --> 01:57.960
Moving mud automatically stratifies.

01:57.960 --> 02:01.200
Get a jar of dirt, add some water to it, shake it up, and set it down.

02:01.200 --> 02:03.700
It settles into layers for you.

02:03.700 --> 02:08.200
This is an important part of what Hovind calls the Hovind Theory.

02:08.200 --> 02:22.280
Yeah, he seems to have dreamed it up by sitting in a chair, because as we shall see, it's

02:22.280 --> 02:27.120
obvious Hovind hasn't actually done the experiment to find out what happens.

02:27.120 --> 02:28.640
Let's do it for him.

02:28.640 --> 02:33.560
To test the Hovind Theory, add different flood detritus to a jar or a small tank.

02:33.560 --> 02:39.720
A few stones, some sand, red clay, weathered clay, humus-rich garden soil, natural topsoil

02:39.720 --> 02:42.360
from the forest, and a bit of vegetation.

02:42.360 --> 02:44.520
Add water and stir.

02:44.520 --> 02:51.400
Let's leave it to settle for a bit and look at more of the Hovind Theory.

02:51.400 --> 02:55.520
When you go down into the canyons near Mount St. Helens, you will see erosion, it was incredible

02:55.520 --> 03:00.680
there, and it has, the sides of the canyon are stratified, nice neat layers.

03:00.680 --> 03:04.840
They say, now wait a minute, all this mud flowed in here at one time, why is it stratified?

03:04.840 --> 03:06.800
Did Hovind just say this was mud?

03:06.800 --> 03:08.840
Wait a minute, all this mud flowed in here at one time.

03:08.840 --> 03:12.800
But this didn't look like a mud flow to me, and I've seen quite a few.

03:12.800 --> 03:17.120
Knowing that Hovind is predisposed to lying through his teeth, I tracked down the picture

03:17.120 --> 03:20.760
to a website called wasdarwinright.com.

03:20.760 --> 03:25.000
It had been reversed, but it's the same photo, and this photo shows much more clearly the

03:25.000 --> 03:29.920
obvious features of ash deposits and pyroclastic flow from a volcano.

03:29.920 --> 03:31.920
The caption on the photo confirms it.

03:31.920 --> 03:38.080
It says the bottom layer formed on May the 18th, 1980, and the middle one a month later.

03:38.080 --> 03:43.200
So not only are these two separate layers, both dates coincide with eruptions of pyroclasts

03:43.200 --> 03:47.080
from Mount St. Helens, not mud flows.

03:47.080 --> 03:51.560
Pyroclast is basically particulate matter ejected from a volcano, as distinct from gas

03:51.560 --> 03:53.340
and lava.

03:53.340 --> 03:58.800
Only the top layer is identified in the caption as a mud flow, and one that occurred two years

03:58.800 --> 03:59.800
later.

03:59.800 --> 04:05.720
Not only did they not form at one time, as Hovind claims, they're not even flood deposits.

04:05.720 --> 04:07.220
Why is this important?

04:07.220 --> 04:12.000
Or to put it another way, why is it important enough for Hovind to want to lie about it?

04:12.000 --> 04:16.700
Well creationists are using Mount St. Helens to argue that a single sedimentary event can

04:16.700 --> 04:21.400
form distinctive layers, and therefore a global flood could have done the same.

04:21.400 --> 04:26.240
But as we've seen, Mount St. Helens was a series of separate events, most of which were

04:26.240 --> 04:29.180
volcanic and not flood related.

04:29.180 --> 04:33.000
A single flood doesn't produce separate layers of different material.

04:33.000 --> 04:36.500
It produces a single layer, a graded material.

04:36.500 --> 04:42.140
I'll let Hovind prove my point by going back to the experiment he obviously never performed.

04:42.140 --> 04:46.260
Here's the tank again a day later, and we can count the number of layers it settled

04:46.260 --> 04:48.260
into.

04:48.260 --> 04:50.020
One.

04:50.020 --> 04:54.020
What you get in this single layer is just a textbook example of what's called graded

04:54.020 --> 04:55.020
bedding.

04:55.380 --> 04:59.340
Coarser grains and heavy gravels tend to be found at the bottom, and smaller and lighter

04:59.340 --> 05:03.380
material like silts and muds are generally found nearer the top.

05:03.380 --> 05:07.500
It may look as though there are two or three separate layers here, but on closer inspection

05:07.500 --> 05:12.360
you can see the different grain sizes and the blurring of the boundaries.

05:12.360 --> 05:17.160
What you don't get are what we see in rocks all around us, clearly defined sedimentary

05:17.160 --> 05:21.700
layers each made of different material and in no particular order.

05:21.700 --> 05:25.500
This photo shows a layer of red limestone topped by chalk.

05:25.500 --> 05:30.320
So if Hovind's flood experiment spectacularly fails to recreate these separate layers, what

05:30.320 --> 05:32.140
would do it?

05:32.140 --> 05:36.020
Well let's add the same materials again, this time recreating the kind of conditions

05:36.020 --> 05:38.340
we see on Earth today.

05:38.340 --> 05:42.100
First sprinkle some mud to replicate what we see laid down in swampy areas or in the

05:42.100 --> 05:44.540
estuaries of silt-rich rivers.

05:44.540 --> 05:49.460
Then the sort of sand that today is being deposited offshore near more arid environments.

05:49.460 --> 05:53.740
Next we'll add a thin layer of topsoil to represent rapid erosion, then coarse sand

05:53.740 --> 05:58.140
and grit to replicate what we see today being deposited in some deltas.

05:58.140 --> 06:02.260
And finally a layer of larger stones to represent a conglomerate.

06:02.260 --> 06:07.700
And presto, we've recreated the layering we see in the rocks all around us.

06:07.700 --> 06:12.260
None of this is magic, I'm just recreating the kind of deposition we see in different

06:12.260 --> 06:14.960
environments all over the world today.

06:14.960 --> 06:19.280
And it fits perfectly with the distinct layering of separate materials we see in the rocks

06:19.280 --> 06:20.840
all around us.

06:20.840 --> 06:23.840
Hovind's experiment clearly doesn't.

06:23.840 --> 06:28.480
Now you could argue that God could have deliberately separated out all the grains and put each

06:28.480 --> 06:33.100
one into different layers to make it look as though there was never any flood.

06:33.100 --> 06:38.080
Or maybe, but the layering isn't the only thing that creationists have to contend with.

06:38.080 --> 06:40.200
Let's go back to Mount St Helens.

06:40.200 --> 06:43.920
Another reason it's used as an argument for the great flood is because it proves that

06:43.920 --> 06:46.960
sediments can be deposited quickly.

06:47.160 --> 06:52.180
No surprise there, and no need to go all the way to Mount St Helens to find that out.

06:52.180 --> 06:56.460
This has been in the geology textbooks for the last 150 years.

06:56.460 --> 07:01.920
We know that some sedimentary material like pyroclast, flood deposit and breccia is deposited

07:01.920 --> 07:03.440
very rapidly.

07:03.440 --> 07:08.160
But to argue that all sediments are therefore deposited quickly is nonsense.

07:08.160 --> 07:11.140
In fact we know they aren't.

07:11.140 --> 07:12.660
Take chalk for example.

07:12.660 --> 07:16.940
It's made of the shells of trillions of marine algae called coccolithophores.

07:16.940 --> 07:21.580
As these organisms die their shell plates, called coccoliths, fall to the bottom of the

07:21.580 --> 07:26.220
sea and accumulate, building up a layer of chalk at a rate of up to two inches every

07:26.220 --> 07:27.900
thousand years.

07:27.900 --> 07:30.660
We can see it happening today and measure it.

07:30.660 --> 07:33.420
And here's the result of it happening in the past.

07:33.420 --> 07:38.780
In different parts of the world we find chalk beds hundreds of feet thick.

07:38.780 --> 07:43.540
What you're hearing is the sound of creationists rushing to answersingenesis.com to find out

07:43.540 --> 07:46.020
what they're supposed to think about all this.

07:46.020 --> 07:50.760
Well answers in Genesis suggest that somehow the algae proliferated during the 150 days

07:50.760 --> 07:55.220
of the flood because they got more nutrients from all the flood detritus.

07:55.220 --> 08:00.640
So instead of making just one inch of chalk in 150 days their rate of deposition suddenly

08:00.640 --> 08:07.160
increased 18 million times and they made all this over 1,000 feet thick.

08:07.160 --> 08:11.840
But even if that was chemically possible and didn't break all the laws of thermodynamics

08:11.840 --> 08:17.080
it doesn't explain why none of that flood detritus got mixed up with the chalk.

08:17.080 --> 08:20.460
Fossilised coral represents another problem for the flood story.

08:20.460 --> 08:23.120
It's obviously not a flood deposit.

08:23.120 --> 08:27.520
Yet we find layers of coral sandwiched between what are supposed to be flood deposits.

08:27.520 --> 08:30.600
We even find layers of coal above the coral.

08:30.600 --> 08:34.880
If we accept the creationist's idea that coal seams are ancient forests that got buried

08:34.880 --> 08:39.200
by the flood what are they doing sitting on top of coral reefs?

08:39.200 --> 08:42.380
Was there an earlier global flood that we don't know about?

08:42.380 --> 08:46.680
So while billions of dead things in sediment laid down by water may seem to be all we've

08:46.680 --> 08:53.000
got under our feet a more detailed and intelligent examination of the rocks shows a very different

08:53.000 --> 08:54.000
story.

08:54.000 --> 08:59.000
These rocks present no great mystery for geologists because they're made of exactly the same sediments

08:59.000 --> 09:03.600
being laid down in different environments today from the slow deposition of chalk and

09:03.600 --> 09:09.000
limestone to the rapid deposition caused by local floods and mudslides to the steady

09:09.000 --> 09:11.920
build-up of sandstones and siltstones.

09:11.920 --> 09:15.880
If creationists like Hovind prefer to sit in their armchairs and make up what they call

09:15.880 --> 09:20.720
theories then there's a very easy way for them to support their case.

09:20.720 --> 09:24.920
Perform experiments to show that an increase in detritus will increase the population of

09:24.920 --> 09:27.560
coccoliths 18 million times.

09:27.560 --> 09:31.840
Instead of telling gullible audiences that an experiment will confirm the flood theory

09:31.840 --> 09:37.560
do the experiment and show how a mix of sand, silt, mud, shells and grit will miraculously

09:37.560 --> 09:39.720
separate into different layers.

09:39.720 --> 09:46.200
No it's no good going to AnswersinGenesis.com they've never done the experiment.

09:46.200 --> 09:50.240
The last thing you want to do when you've got a theory that's wrong is do an experiment

09:50.240 --> 09:52.000
that will prove it wrong.

09:52.000 --> 09:57.280
But we live in the 21st century where we don't have to just accept these Bronze Age stories

09:57.280 --> 10:00.280
because Sunday school teachers tell us they're true.

10:00.280 --> 10:04.200
We're capable of thinking and finding out for ourselves.

10:04.200 --> 10:07.440
So that just about wraps it up for the waterborne sediments.

10:07.440 --> 10:11.040
In the next video we'll look at the billions and billions of dead things.
