WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:07.400
So if we move quickly on then to the next slide, here we get a rather prodigious mismatch

00:07.400 --> 00:13.560
again between CO2 concentration, which is the black line, and temperature concentration,

00:13.560 --> 00:17.920
which is the blue line, going right back to almost 600,000 years into the past.

00:17.920 --> 00:27.320
And here we had almost 7,000 parts per million of CO2 compared with 385 or thereby today.

00:27.840 --> 00:33.840
7,000 then, temperature managed to get up to about 22 Celsius and has never really gone

00:33.840 --> 00:37.920
much higher than that at any time over the past half billion years.

00:37.920 --> 00:42.400
As best it can be reconstructed, there are of course again difficulties going that far

00:42.400 --> 00:48.160
and getting accurate results, but the IPCC itself says that in the Cambrian, carbon dioxide

00:48.160 --> 00:52.380
certainly went up in its opinion to around 6,000 parts per million, so this is not a

00:52.380 --> 00:54.260
controversial graph.

00:54.260 --> 00:58.140
What it is controversial is that again it doesn't show a terribly good link between

00:58.140 --> 00:59.140
the two.

00:59.140 --> 01:03.180
And look at how little correlation there is in that graph between temperature in blue

01:03.180 --> 01:06.700
there and CO2 concentration in black.

01:06.700 --> 01:09.660
Plainly, CO2 is only a bit part player in all this.

01:09.660 --> 01:13.300
What I love about Christopher Monckton is that he doesn't give us fuzzy conclusions

01:13.300 --> 01:18.220
based on ambiguities, as do Tim Ball and other critics of climate science.

01:18.220 --> 01:22.680
He's like a school student who not only shows his math teacher the answer, but also his

01:22.680 --> 01:25.180
workings out to show how he got there.

01:25.180 --> 01:28.700
So it's very easy to see exactly where he went wrong.

01:28.700 --> 01:31.460
Just check his sums and check his sources.

01:31.460 --> 01:36.080
Monckton's sources for no correlation between CO2 and temperature are shown right here.

01:36.080 --> 01:41.420
Two researchers, Berner who compiled a graph showing CO2 levels, and Scotty's who compiled

01:41.420 --> 01:43.480
a graph showing temperatures.

01:43.480 --> 01:47.300
Put the two together and you get the graph Monckton used.

01:47.300 --> 01:52.380
Scotty's hasn't done any analysis of correlation, but Berner has, so let's look at the paper

01:52.380 --> 01:56.740
where the data Monckton used was published, which obviously Monckton should have read

01:56.740 --> 01:59.380
if he's citing this as his source.

01:59.380 --> 02:01.900
We'll read Berner's conclusion together.

02:01.900 --> 02:06.900
This means that over the long term there is indeed a correlation between CO2 and paleo

02:06.900 --> 02:11.640
temperature as manifested by the atmospheric greenhouse effect.

02:11.640 --> 02:13.780
Did Monckton somehow miss this?

02:13.780 --> 02:18.680
Donna Royer, who also reviewed all the data on past temperatures and CO2 levels in a landmark

02:18.680 --> 02:24.100
paper, also concluded that there's a clear correlation throughout the Phanerozoic.

02:24.100 --> 02:28.760
You may find this a bit odd because the graph Monckton showed his audiences obviously shows

02:28.760 --> 02:30.780
no correlation at all.

02:30.780 --> 02:35.700
So either geologists are in on this global conspiracy with climatologists and are lying

02:35.700 --> 02:40.080
through their teeth in order to set up a world Marxist government, or there's something they

02:40.080 --> 02:43.440
know that's missing from Monckton's graph.

02:43.440 --> 02:47.560
For those who share Monckton's confusion, let me again use the analogy of a heater in

02:47.560 --> 02:53.280
a mountain cabin and see if you can work out what that missing something might be.

02:53.280 --> 02:57.440
Remember the warming effect of CO2 is the output of our heater and the cabin is the

02:57.440 --> 02:58.440
earth.

02:58.440 --> 03:02.920
If there's a correlation, then whenever we turn up the heater, the cabin should warm

03:02.920 --> 03:03.920
up.

03:03.920 --> 03:06.960
When we turn the heater down, the cabin will cool down.

03:06.960 --> 03:10.560
So let's see how they correlate over a six month period.

03:10.560 --> 03:14.720
If we start our graph on January 1st, the heat is way up high and the temperature of

03:14.720 --> 03:17.200
the cabin is toasty and warm.

03:17.240 --> 03:21.920
During a cold snap I turn the heater up a bit, but I still freeze my nuts off.

03:21.920 --> 03:26.560
In the spring I begin to turn the heater down, and so it goes on with the cabin temperature

03:26.560 --> 03:31.520
remaining reasonably equitable until we reach today, July 1st.

03:31.520 --> 03:36.800
This is a fairly typical output from most home heating systems between January and July.

03:36.800 --> 03:41.320
Over time we can plot the output of the heater and the corresponding temperature and we can

03:41.320 --> 03:45.200
seeâ€¦ there's no bloody correlation at all.

03:45.200 --> 03:46.580
But how come?

03:46.580 --> 03:51.720
The only possible conclusion is that the heater does not affect the temperature of the cabin.

03:51.720 --> 03:55.580
When you think about it, it's obvious, because here the heater was turned up much higher

03:55.580 --> 03:59.100
than today and yet the cabin was much cooler.

03:59.100 --> 04:02.340
But before you believe someone who tells you this means you can turn up the heater in the

04:02.340 --> 04:06.760
middle of summer and it won't make life in the cabin unbearably hot, you might want

04:06.760 --> 04:09.340
to find out why the experts disagree.

04:09.340 --> 04:14.460
Actually, I hope everyone is smart enough to have figured out why there's no correlation.

04:14.460 --> 04:19.220
When I began heating the cabin on January 1st, it was mid-winter and solar irradiation

04:19.220 --> 04:20.740
was very low.

04:20.740 --> 04:24.700
When I finished plotting the graph on July 1st, it was mid-summer.

04:24.700 --> 04:29.740
What's missing from our graph is the most important heat source of all, the Sun.

04:29.740 --> 04:33.540
But surely the analogy isn't the same as the Earth, because the Sun obviously gives the

04:33.540 --> 04:38.020
northern hemisphere more heat between January and July, but it hasn't been getting hotter

04:38.020 --> 04:40.020
between the Cambrian and now.

04:40.020 --> 04:42.140
Oh yes it has.

04:42.140 --> 04:46.780
Unless you think solar physicists and cosmologists have also joined the international Marxist

04:46.780 --> 04:52.380
conspiracy, the Sun was around 6% weaker during the Cambrian and it's been growing more powerful

04:52.380 --> 04:53.380
over time.

04:53.380 --> 04:57.980
A useful way of looking at this is to think of the Cambrian as Earth's winter and today

04:57.980 --> 04:59.580
as its summer.

04:59.580 --> 05:04.180
When you take solar irradiance into account, Royer showed there's almost a perfect correlation

05:04.180 --> 05:07.020
between CO2 and global temperature.

05:07.020 --> 05:12.460
A paper published in 2010 called carbon dioxide the principal control knob of the Earth's

05:12.460 --> 05:13.460
temperature.

05:13.460 --> 05:17.740
Not understanding the implications of the Sun's weakness leads Monckton into all sorts

05:17.740 --> 05:19.460
of other misconceptions.

05:19.460 --> 05:29.500
750 million years ago, a mile of ice at the equator, ice planet all round, therefore,

05:29.500 --> 05:35.380
at the surface, 300,000 parts per million of CO2.

05:35.380 --> 05:42.740
Can you tell me how that much CO2 could have been in the atmosphere and yet allowed that

05:42.740 --> 05:44.820
amount of ice at the equator?

05:44.820 --> 05:48.560
Well I'm glad he's phrased this as a question because it's a good question.

05:48.560 --> 05:52.260
It's a shame Monckton never tried to find the answer before hitting the stage and going

05:52.260 --> 05:54.660
to Congress with his own theories.

05:54.660 --> 05:59.220
If his debating opponent Tim Lambert will allow me, I'll be happy to answer it.

05:59.220 --> 06:02.900
The specific time Monckton's referring to is towards the end of what's colloquially

06:02.900 --> 06:05.100
known as Snowball Earth.

06:05.100 --> 06:09.840
The evidence of an Earth covered in ice is the discovery of glacial dropstones in rocks

06:09.840 --> 06:13.500
that were in the tropics over 700 million years ago.

06:13.500 --> 06:18.060
Given the weakness of the Sun at the time, an ice planet is no surprise.

06:18.060 --> 06:23.020
Since this is our geological winter, the Sun should have kept our planet permanently frozen

06:23.020 --> 06:26.180
and the high albedo of ice would have kept it that way.

06:26.180 --> 06:31.100
The fact that it wasn't permanently frozen, a puzzle once called the faint Sun paradox,

06:31.100 --> 06:36.660
is explained by the warming effect of greenhouse gases, primarily carbon dioxide.

06:36.660 --> 06:41.620
But if carbon dioxide levels fell or some other event overcame this greenhouse effect,

06:41.620 --> 06:44.940
it wouldn't have taken much to tip the world into an ice age.

06:44.940 --> 06:51.140
The expanding ice reflected more of the already weak solar irradiation, a positive feedback,

06:51.140 --> 06:55.820
leading to more cooling, more ice and more reflection until nearly the entire planet

06:55.820 --> 06:57.620
was covered with ice.

06:57.620 --> 07:02.220
Lambert explains quite rightly that the albedo of this ice planet would have been extremely

07:02.220 --> 07:03.220
high.

07:03.220 --> 07:06.940
Nearly all the solar radiation falling on it, which wasn't very much anyway because

07:06.940 --> 07:09.580
of the weaker Sun, would have been reflected.

07:09.580 --> 07:13.320
There's no way the Sun could have melted all this ice.

07:13.320 --> 07:15.860
And even Monckton wouldn't suggest such a thing.

07:15.860 --> 07:20.740
But something did, because within a few million years the ice had not only disappeared, the

07:20.740 --> 07:23.500
Earth had turned into a hot house.

07:23.500 --> 07:25.740
Geologists say the explanation is very simple.

07:25.740 --> 07:30.660
The only part of the Earth not covered by ice were warm spots caused by volcanoes.

07:30.660 --> 07:35.220
They weren't enough to melt the area around them, let alone an entire planet made of ice.

07:35.220 --> 07:40.540
But they did release gases when they erupted, including carbon dioxide.

07:40.540 --> 07:44.780
Under normal conditions, this carbon dioxide would have reacted with rocks and rainwater

07:44.780 --> 07:48.800
to form carbonate minerals, which get washed out to sea.

07:48.800 --> 07:53.580
But in snowball Earth conditions, there's no rain, no chemical weathering and no disposal

07:53.580 --> 07:55.380
of this carbon dioxide.

07:55.420 --> 07:59.700
It just kept building up in the atmosphere over millions of years to higher and higher

07:59.700 --> 08:01.660
concentrations.

08:01.660 --> 08:05.820
Until eventually it reached a high enough concentration to overcome the weak Sun and

08:05.820 --> 08:08.220
the high albedo of ice.

08:08.220 --> 08:12.140
So if you were to take a snapshot in time at the end of the last snowball, of course

08:12.140 --> 08:17.220
you'd find exceptionally high CO2 levels while glaciers were at the equator.

08:17.220 --> 08:19.100
But this is a dynamic process.

08:19.100 --> 08:21.380
It doesn't stand still like this.

08:21.380 --> 08:25.420
If we go back to the analogy of our winter cabin, let's say we've been away for months

08:25.420 --> 08:28.080
and it's covered in ice and frozen solid.

08:28.080 --> 08:32.300
The only way to unfreeze it is to put the heater on very high.

08:32.300 --> 08:35.340
When it's going full blast, take a picture.

08:35.340 --> 08:39.180
Does this tell you the heater obviously has no effect on the temperature of the cabin?

08:39.180 --> 08:43.300
I'm sure everyone knows the answer, but for the sake of those who don't, the answer

08:43.300 --> 08:44.460
is no.

08:44.460 --> 08:48.980
It means it takes a few hours or even days for the heater to do its work and melt all

08:48.980 --> 08:50.340
the ice.

08:50.340 --> 08:55.100
And if the heater keeps going, then you'll turn the cabin into a sauna.

08:55.100 --> 08:59.060
In exactly the same way, it took millions of years for the greenhouse warming from all

08:59.060 --> 09:02.820
that CO2 to completely melt the ice.

09:02.820 --> 09:07.020
Melting an ice planet takes a lot of heat and physicists have calculated just how much

09:07.020 --> 09:08.320
was needed.

09:08.320 --> 09:13.260
It turns out that the level of CO2 in the atmosphere had to be 350 times what it is

09:13.260 --> 09:14.420
today.

09:14.420 --> 09:19.540
As the ice melted, open areas of ocean absorbed more heat from the Sun, setting up positive

09:19.540 --> 09:22.880
feedback, so the melting accelerated.

09:22.880 --> 09:26.780
After the ice melted, the high levels of CO2 were still around and the Earth's albedo

09:26.780 --> 09:30.420
was much lower, so temperatures kept rising.

09:30.420 --> 09:34.140
The Earth now swung the other way into a hot house.

09:34.140 --> 09:38.340
So far from showing that carbon dioxide doesn't have any effect on temperatures, Snowball

09:38.340 --> 09:40.620
Earth shows the complete opposite.

09:40.620 --> 09:44.560
It confirms what other studies of the Earth's history have shown, that since output from

09:44.560 --> 09:49.320
the Sun has been steadily rising, carbon dioxide is the key driver of long-term climate

09:49.320 --> 09:50.480
change on Earth.

09:50.480 --> 09:54.720
If something else unlocked a frozen Earth, and something else turned the Earth into a

09:54.720 --> 10:00.400
hot house during that geological winter, Mungton doesn't explain what he thinks it was.

10:00.400 --> 10:02.760
You're going to like this.

10:02.760 --> 10:07.320
I got this from Professor M. I. Bhatt of the Indian Geological Survey when I was asking

10:07.320 --> 10:09.360
him what was happening to the Himalayan glaciers.

10:09.360 --> 10:10.960
They're doing fine, by the way.

10:10.960 --> 10:15.760
He's got 200 years of records from the days of the Raj when we first began monitoring

10:15.760 --> 10:17.960
these things dead to death.

10:17.960 --> 10:21.640
And the glaciers are showing no particular change in 200 years.

10:21.640 --> 10:26.080
The only glacier that's declined a little is Gangotri, a very famous glacier, because

10:26.080 --> 10:29.400
there's been local geological instability, nothing to do with global warming.

10:29.400 --> 10:30.400
All the others are doing fine.

10:30.400 --> 10:35.480
We've heard a lot about Himalayan glaciers since the IPCC made that horrendous bungle

10:35.480 --> 10:38.640
predicting their disappearance by 2035.

10:38.840 --> 10:43.440
Lord Mungton says there's been no sign of change for 200 years, and none of the glaciers

10:43.440 --> 10:49.520
are even retreating, except one, and that's because of local geological instability.

10:49.520 --> 10:54.560
But once again, Mungton tells his audiences this without citing a source, except for someone

10:54.560 --> 10:56.400
called Professor Bhatt.

10:56.400 --> 10:58.640
So I wrote to Mungton to get his source.

10:58.640 --> 11:02.640
You quote M. I. Bhatt, but could you please cite the specific research paper where he

11:02.640 --> 11:05.840
published his study on this, if that is your source?

11:05.840 --> 11:08.120
If not, what was your source?

11:08.120 --> 11:10.600
I received this reply.

11:10.600 --> 11:14.240
Professor Bhatt is entirely clear, as the man on the ground, that there is no unusual

11:14.240 --> 11:18.720
pattern of glacial advance or recession in the Himalayas, and the locally produced literature

11:18.720 --> 11:20.840
tends to support this.

11:20.840 --> 11:25.440
Mungton attached a paper which didn't support his contention that Himalayan glaciers had

11:25.440 --> 11:27.760
been stable for 200 years.

11:27.760 --> 11:30.960
So I wrote back, I respect Professor Bhatt's opinion.

11:30.960 --> 11:35.040
The problem is I really need references to the published, peer-reviewed research that

11:35.040 --> 11:36.360
it's based on.

11:36.360 --> 11:41.500
As he, or anyone, written either a paper showing evidence that supports that opinion.

11:41.500 --> 11:46.880
When Mungton replied, he still gave no reference to a paper which substantiated his claim.

11:46.880 --> 11:50.600
But I did learn about the status of the mysterious Professor Bhatt.

11:50.600 --> 11:54.640
If you would like to learn more about Himalayan glaciers, talk to the guy who is responsible

11:54.640 --> 11:56.040
for monitoring them.

11:56.040 --> 11:58.400
And then he gave me the email address.

11:58.400 --> 12:02.200
It was becoming clear that Mungton had no research to back up his statement that the

12:02.200 --> 12:05.800
Himalayan glaciers had been stable for 200 years.

12:05.800 --> 12:10.200
Instead, he based all of his assertions on the word of Professor Bhatt in the belief

12:10.200 --> 12:14.360
that he's the person responsible for monitoring Himalayan glaciers.

12:14.360 --> 12:18.880
So in order to verify his source, that needs to be substantiated.

12:18.880 --> 12:21.960
Back to Mungton again for an explanation.

12:21.960 --> 12:25.920
Isn't Professor Bhatt's research field tectonics not glaciology?

12:25.920 --> 12:30.720
In what professional or official capacity is he the guy who is responsible for monitoring

12:30.720 --> 12:33.040
Himalayan glaciers?

12:33.040 --> 12:37.920
I got back a long discourse on the role of tectonics in glaciers and how the Himalayas

12:37.920 --> 12:42.840
are rising, another reference to the fact that the IPCC got it wrong, and puzzlement

12:42.840 --> 12:45.120
that I continued to demand references.

12:45.120 --> 12:47.520
Actually, I wasn't asking for references.

12:47.520 --> 12:52.540
I was asking Mungton to substantiate his claim that his source was the person responsible

12:52.540 --> 12:54.840
for monitoring Himalayan glaciers.

12:54.840 --> 12:59.020
And nowhere in his long email did he answer that question.

12:59.020 --> 13:02.900
Buried right at the bottom was the admission I'd been expecting.

13:02.900 --> 13:09.020
Yes, mountain glaciers in many regions, including the Himalayas, have been receding.

13:09.020 --> 13:12.140
The glaciers are showing no particular change in 200 years.

13:12.140 --> 13:17.540
Well, Mr Mungton, now you know why I continue to ask, very politely by the way, for your

13:17.540 --> 13:18.540
sources.

13:18.540 --> 13:22.500
In the absence of any, you finally have to acknowledge the facts.

13:22.500 --> 13:28.340
When pressed for a source, you eventually say that they've been receding since the 1820s.

13:28.340 --> 13:32.300
Even this has no source, but I'm not going to chase up your sources every time you decide

13:32.300 --> 13:35.600
to change your mind about what you call the truth.

13:35.600 --> 13:39.940
But although I finally had Mungton's confession on the glaciers, I still didn't have an answer

13:39.940 --> 13:43.200
to my very simple question about his source.

13:43.200 --> 13:47.860
And when politicians evade questions, it means they're hiding something.

13:47.860 --> 13:51.500
By now I'd written to Dr Batt and asked him this very question.

13:51.500 --> 13:56.260
Could I describe you as the person who is responsible for monitoring Himalayan glaciers?

13:56.260 --> 14:01.660
After which Batt had responded, the big and loud answer is NO!

14:01.660 --> 14:06.140
So if Batt himself doesn't seem to think he was responsible for monitoring glaciers, I

14:06.140 --> 14:09.680
was curious as to what evidence Mungton had that he was.

14:09.680 --> 14:11.180
So I asked again.

14:11.180 --> 14:16.460
To recap, you said the source of your Himalayan glaciers claim is Dr Batt, whom you describe

14:16.460 --> 14:19.580
as the guy who is responsible for monitoring them.

14:19.580 --> 14:24.480
Since this is your claim, I have to establish in what official or professional capacity

14:24.480 --> 14:28.880
Dr Batt is the person responsible for monitoring Himalayan glaciers.

14:28.880 --> 14:32.240
This should be a fairly easy question to answer.

14:32.240 --> 14:33.600
Did I get an answer?

14:33.600 --> 14:35.600
No, of course not.

14:35.600 --> 14:38.400
But I did get the familiar Mungton climb-down.

14:38.400 --> 14:43.160
No admission that what he said was wrong, just a quiet change of wording.

14:43.160 --> 14:47.760
Instead of being the guy responsible for monitoring Himalayan earthquakes, Professor Batt suddenly

14:47.760 --> 14:52.120
gets demoted to someone who merely seems to be knowledgeable.

14:52.120 --> 14:56.200
So with no admission that he got anything wrong, Mungton has now climbed all the way

14:56.200 --> 15:00.500
down from a speech where he told audiences that the Himalayas have shown no particular

15:00.500 --> 15:06.040
change in 200 years, based on the advice of the person responsible for monitoring them,

15:06.040 --> 15:10.480
to a claim that they have been retreating for nearly 200 years, based on the advice

15:10.480 --> 15:17.080
of someone who seems to be knowledgeable, and not a single peer-reviewed paper in sight.

15:17.080 --> 15:23.920
Anything I say, I can and will on request verify, either in the data or with equations

15:23.920 --> 15:25.920
or in the peer-reviewed literature.
