1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,400
So if we move quickly on then to the next slide, here we get a rather prodigious mismatch

2
00:00:07,400 --> 00:00:13,560
again between CO2 concentration, which is the black line, and temperature concentration,

3
00:00:13,560 --> 00:00:17,920
which is the blue line, going right back to almost 600,000 years into the past.

4
00:00:17,920 --> 00:00:27,320
And here we had almost 7,000 parts per million of CO2 compared with 385 or thereby today.

5
00:00:27,840 --> 00:00:33,840
7,000 then, temperature managed to get up to about 22 Celsius and has never really gone

6
00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:37,920
much higher than that at any time over the past half billion years.

7
00:00:37,920 --> 00:00:42,400
As best it can be reconstructed, there are of course again difficulties going that far

8
00:00:42,400 --> 00:00:48,160
and getting accurate results, but the IPCC itself says that in the Cambrian, carbon dioxide

9
00:00:48,160 --> 00:00:52,380
certainly went up in its opinion to around 6,000 parts per million, so this is not a

10
00:00:52,380 --> 00:00:54,260
controversial graph.

11
00:00:54,260 --> 00:00:58,140
What it is controversial is that again it doesn't show a terribly good link between

12
00:00:58,140 --> 00:00:59,140
the two.

13
00:00:59,140 --> 00:01:03,180
And look at how little correlation there is in that graph between temperature in blue

14
00:01:03,180 --> 00:01:06,700
there and CO2 concentration in black.

15
00:01:06,700 --> 00:01:09,660
Plainly, CO2 is only a bit part player in all this.

16
00:01:09,660 --> 00:01:13,300
What I love about Christopher Monckton is that he doesn't give us fuzzy conclusions

17
00:01:13,300 --> 00:01:18,220
based on ambiguities, as do Tim Ball and other critics of climate science.

18
00:01:18,220 --> 00:01:22,680
He's like a school student who not only shows his math teacher the answer, but also his

19
00:01:22,680 --> 00:01:25,180
workings out to show how he got there.

20
00:01:25,180 --> 00:01:28,700
So it's very easy to see exactly where he went wrong.

21
00:01:28,700 --> 00:01:31,460
Just check his sums and check his sources.

22
00:01:31,460 --> 00:01:36,080
Monckton's sources for no correlation between CO2 and temperature are shown right here.

23
00:01:36,080 --> 00:01:41,420
Two researchers, Berner who compiled a graph showing CO2 levels, and Scotty's who compiled

24
00:01:41,420 --> 00:01:43,480
a graph showing temperatures.

25
00:01:43,480 --> 00:01:47,300
Put the two together and you get the graph Monckton used.

26
00:01:47,300 --> 00:01:52,380
Scotty's hasn't done any analysis of correlation, but Berner has, so let's look at the paper

27
00:01:52,380 --> 00:01:56,740
where the data Monckton used was published, which obviously Monckton should have read

28
00:01:56,740 --> 00:01:59,380
if he's citing this as his source.

29
00:01:59,380 --> 00:02:01,900
We'll read Berner's conclusion together.

30
00:02:01,900 --> 00:02:06,900
This means that over the long term there is indeed a correlation between CO2 and paleo

31
00:02:06,900 --> 00:02:11,640
temperature as manifested by the atmospheric greenhouse effect.

32
00:02:11,640 --> 00:02:13,780
Did Monckton somehow miss this?

33
00:02:13,780 --> 00:02:18,680
Donna Royer, who also reviewed all the data on past temperatures and CO2 levels in a landmark

34
00:02:18,680 --> 00:02:24,100
paper, also concluded that there's a clear correlation throughout the Phanerozoic.

35
00:02:24,100 --> 00:02:28,760
You may find this a bit odd because the graph Monckton showed his audiences obviously shows

36
00:02:28,760 --> 00:02:30,780
no correlation at all.

37
00:02:30,780 --> 00:02:35,700
So either geologists are in on this global conspiracy with climatologists and are lying

38
00:02:35,700 --> 00:02:40,080
through their teeth in order to set up a world Marxist government, or there's something they

39
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:43,440
know that's missing from Monckton's graph.

40
00:02:43,440 --> 00:02:47,560
For those who share Monckton's confusion, let me again use the analogy of a heater in

41
00:02:47,560 --> 00:02:53,280
a mountain cabin and see if you can work out what that missing something might be.

42
00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:57,440
Remember the warming effect of CO2 is the output of our heater and the cabin is the

43
00:02:57,440 --> 00:02:58,440
earth.

44
00:02:58,440 --> 00:03:02,920
If there's a correlation, then whenever we turn up the heater, the cabin should warm

45
00:03:02,920 --> 00:03:03,920
up.

46
00:03:03,920 --> 00:03:06,960
When we turn the heater down, the cabin will cool down.

47
00:03:06,960 --> 00:03:10,560
So let's see how they correlate over a six month period.

48
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:14,720
If we start our graph on January 1st, the heat is way up high and the temperature of

49
00:03:14,720 --> 00:03:17,200
the cabin is toasty and warm.

50
00:03:17,240 --> 00:03:21,920
During a cold snap I turn the heater up a bit, but I still freeze my nuts off.

51
00:03:21,920 --> 00:03:26,560
In the spring I begin to turn the heater down, and so it goes on with the cabin temperature

52
00:03:26,560 --> 00:03:31,520
remaining reasonably equitable until we reach today, July 1st.

53
00:03:31,520 --> 00:03:36,800
This is a fairly typical output from most home heating systems between January and July.

54
00:03:36,800 --> 00:03:41,320
Over time we can plot the output of the heater and the corresponding temperature and we can

55
00:03:41,320 --> 00:03:45,200
seeâ€¦ there's no bloody correlation at all.

56
00:03:45,200 --> 00:03:46,580
But how come?

57
00:03:46,580 --> 00:03:51,720
The only possible conclusion is that the heater does not affect the temperature of the cabin.

58
00:03:51,720 --> 00:03:55,580
When you think about it, it's obvious, because here the heater was turned up much higher

59
00:03:55,580 --> 00:03:59,100
than today and yet the cabin was much cooler.

60
00:03:59,100 --> 00:04:02,340
But before you believe someone who tells you this means you can turn up the heater in the

61
00:04:02,340 --> 00:04:06,760
middle of summer and it won't make life in the cabin unbearably hot, you might want

62
00:04:06,760 --> 00:04:09,340
to find out why the experts disagree.

63
00:04:09,340 --> 00:04:14,460
Actually, I hope everyone is smart enough to have figured out why there's no correlation.

64
00:04:14,460 --> 00:04:19,220
When I began heating the cabin on January 1st, it was mid-winter and solar irradiation

65
00:04:19,220 --> 00:04:20,740
was very low.

66
00:04:20,740 --> 00:04:24,700
When I finished plotting the graph on July 1st, it was mid-summer.

67
00:04:24,700 --> 00:04:29,740
What's missing from our graph is the most important heat source of all, the Sun.

68
00:04:29,740 --> 00:04:33,540
But surely the analogy isn't the same as the Earth, because the Sun obviously gives the

69
00:04:33,540 --> 00:04:38,020
northern hemisphere more heat between January and July, but it hasn't been getting hotter

70
00:04:38,020 --> 00:04:40,020
between the Cambrian and now.

71
00:04:40,020 --> 00:04:42,140
Oh yes it has.

72
00:04:42,140 --> 00:04:46,780
Unless you think solar physicists and cosmologists have also joined the international Marxist

73
00:04:46,780 --> 00:04:52,380
conspiracy, the Sun was around 6% weaker during the Cambrian and it's been growing more powerful

74
00:04:52,380 --> 00:04:53,380
over time.

75
00:04:53,380 --> 00:04:57,980
A useful way of looking at this is to think of the Cambrian as Earth's winter and today

76
00:04:57,980 --> 00:04:59,580
as its summer.

77
00:04:59,580 --> 00:05:04,180
When you take solar irradiance into account, Royer showed there's almost a perfect correlation

78
00:05:04,180 --> 00:05:07,020
between CO2 and global temperature.

79
00:05:07,020 --> 00:05:12,460
A paper published in 2010 called carbon dioxide the principal control knob of the Earth's

80
00:05:12,460 --> 00:05:13,460
temperature.

81
00:05:13,460 --> 00:05:17,740
Not understanding the implications of the Sun's weakness leads Monckton into all sorts

82
00:05:17,740 --> 00:05:19,460
of other misconceptions.

83
00:05:19,460 --> 00:05:29,500
750 million years ago, a mile of ice at the equator, ice planet all round, therefore,

84
00:05:29,500 --> 00:05:35,380
at the surface, 300,000 parts per million of CO2.

85
00:05:35,380 --> 00:05:42,740
Can you tell me how that much CO2 could have been in the atmosphere and yet allowed that

86
00:05:42,740 --> 00:05:44,820
amount of ice at the equator?

87
00:05:44,820 --> 00:05:48,560
Well I'm glad he's phrased this as a question because it's a good question.

88
00:05:48,560 --> 00:05:52,260
It's a shame Monckton never tried to find the answer before hitting the stage and going

89
00:05:52,260 --> 00:05:54,660
to Congress with his own theories.

90
00:05:54,660 --> 00:05:59,220
If his debating opponent Tim Lambert will allow me, I'll be happy to answer it.

91
00:05:59,220 --> 00:06:02,900
The specific time Monckton's referring to is towards the end of what's colloquially

92
00:06:02,900 --> 00:06:05,100
known as Snowball Earth.

93
00:06:05,100 --> 00:06:09,840
The evidence of an Earth covered in ice is the discovery of glacial dropstones in rocks

94
00:06:09,840 --> 00:06:13,500
that were in the tropics over 700 million years ago.

95
00:06:13,500 --> 00:06:18,060
Given the weakness of the Sun at the time, an ice planet is no surprise.

96
00:06:18,060 --> 00:06:23,020
Since this is our geological winter, the Sun should have kept our planet permanently frozen

97
00:06:23,020 --> 00:06:26,180
and the high albedo of ice would have kept it that way.

98
00:06:26,180 --> 00:06:31,100
The fact that it wasn't permanently frozen, a puzzle once called the faint Sun paradox,

99
00:06:31,100 --> 00:06:36,660
is explained by the warming effect of greenhouse gases, primarily carbon dioxide.

100
00:06:36,660 --> 00:06:41,620
But if carbon dioxide levels fell or some other event overcame this greenhouse effect,

101
00:06:41,620 --> 00:06:44,940
it wouldn't have taken much to tip the world into an ice age.

102
00:06:44,940 --> 00:06:51,140
The expanding ice reflected more of the already weak solar irradiation, a positive feedback,

103
00:06:51,140 --> 00:06:55,820
leading to more cooling, more ice and more reflection until nearly the entire planet

104
00:06:55,820 --> 00:06:57,620
was covered with ice.

105
00:06:57,620 --> 00:07:02,220
Lambert explains quite rightly that the albedo of this ice planet would have been extremely

106
00:07:02,220 --> 00:07:03,220
high.

107
00:07:03,220 --> 00:07:06,940
Nearly all the solar radiation falling on it, which wasn't very much anyway because

108
00:07:06,940 --> 00:07:09,580
of the weaker Sun, would have been reflected.

109
00:07:09,580 --> 00:07:13,320
There's no way the Sun could have melted all this ice.

110
00:07:13,320 --> 00:07:15,860
And even Monckton wouldn't suggest such a thing.

111
00:07:15,860 --> 00:07:20,740
But something did, because within a few million years the ice had not only disappeared, the

112
00:07:20,740 --> 00:07:23,500
Earth had turned into a hot house.

113
00:07:23,500 --> 00:07:25,740
Geologists say the explanation is very simple.

114
00:07:25,740 --> 00:07:30,660
The only part of the Earth not covered by ice were warm spots caused by volcanoes.

115
00:07:30,660 --> 00:07:35,220
They weren't enough to melt the area around them, let alone an entire planet made of ice.

116
00:07:35,220 --> 00:07:40,540
But they did release gases when they erupted, including carbon dioxide.

117
00:07:40,540 --> 00:07:44,780
Under normal conditions, this carbon dioxide would have reacted with rocks and rainwater

118
00:07:44,780 --> 00:07:48,800
to form carbonate minerals, which get washed out to sea.

119
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:53,580
But in snowball Earth conditions, there's no rain, no chemical weathering and no disposal

120
00:07:53,580 --> 00:07:55,380
of this carbon dioxide.

121
00:07:55,420 --> 00:07:59,700
It just kept building up in the atmosphere over millions of years to higher and higher

122
00:07:59,700 --> 00:08:01,660
concentrations.

123
00:08:01,660 --> 00:08:05,820
Until eventually it reached a high enough concentration to overcome the weak Sun and

124
00:08:05,820 --> 00:08:08,220
the high albedo of ice.

125
00:08:08,220 --> 00:08:12,140
So if you were to take a snapshot in time at the end of the last snowball, of course

126
00:08:12,140 --> 00:08:17,220
you'd find exceptionally high CO2 levels while glaciers were at the equator.

127
00:08:17,220 --> 00:08:19,100
But this is a dynamic process.

128
00:08:19,100 --> 00:08:21,380
It doesn't stand still like this.

129
00:08:21,380 --> 00:08:25,420
If we go back to the analogy of our winter cabin, let's say we've been away for months

130
00:08:25,420 --> 00:08:28,080
and it's covered in ice and frozen solid.

131
00:08:28,080 --> 00:08:32,300
The only way to unfreeze it is to put the heater on very high.

132
00:08:32,300 --> 00:08:35,340
When it's going full blast, take a picture.

133
00:08:35,340 --> 00:08:39,180
Does this tell you the heater obviously has no effect on the temperature of the cabin?

134
00:08:39,180 --> 00:08:43,300
I'm sure everyone knows the answer, but for the sake of those who don't, the answer

135
00:08:43,300 --> 00:08:44,460
is no.

136
00:08:44,460 --> 00:08:48,980
It means it takes a few hours or even days for the heater to do its work and melt all

137
00:08:48,980 --> 00:08:50,340
the ice.

138
00:08:50,340 --> 00:08:55,100
And if the heater keeps going, then you'll turn the cabin into a sauna.

139
00:08:55,100 --> 00:08:59,060
In exactly the same way, it took millions of years for the greenhouse warming from all

140
00:08:59,060 --> 00:09:02,820
that CO2 to completely melt the ice.

141
00:09:02,820 --> 00:09:07,020
Melting an ice planet takes a lot of heat and physicists have calculated just how much

142
00:09:07,020 --> 00:09:08,320
was needed.

143
00:09:08,320 --> 00:09:13,260
It turns out that the level of CO2 in the atmosphere had to be 350 times what it is

144
00:09:13,260 --> 00:09:14,420
today.

145
00:09:14,420 --> 00:09:19,540
As the ice melted, open areas of ocean absorbed more heat from the Sun, setting up positive

146
00:09:19,540 --> 00:09:22,880
feedback, so the melting accelerated.

147
00:09:22,880 --> 00:09:26,780
After the ice melted, the high levels of CO2 were still around and the Earth's albedo

148
00:09:26,780 --> 00:09:30,420
was much lower, so temperatures kept rising.

149
00:09:30,420 --> 00:09:34,140
The Earth now swung the other way into a hot house.

150
00:09:34,140 --> 00:09:38,340
So far from showing that carbon dioxide doesn't have any effect on temperatures, Snowball

151
00:09:38,340 --> 00:09:40,620
Earth shows the complete opposite.

152
00:09:40,620 --> 00:09:44,560
It confirms what other studies of the Earth's history have shown, that since output from

153
00:09:44,560 --> 00:09:49,320
the Sun has been steadily rising, carbon dioxide is the key driver of long-term climate

154
00:09:49,320 --> 00:09:50,480
change on Earth.

155
00:09:50,480 --> 00:09:54,720
If something else unlocked a frozen Earth, and something else turned the Earth into a

156
00:09:54,720 --> 00:10:00,400
hot house during that geological winter, Mungton doesn't explain what he thinks it was.

157
00:10:00,400 --> 00:10:02,760
You're going to like this.

158
00:10:02,760 --> 00:10:07,320
I got this from Professor M. I. Bhatt of the Indian Geological Survey when I was asking

159
00:10:07,320 --> 00:10:09,360
him what was happening to the Himalayan glaciers.

160
00:10:09,360 --> 00:10:10,960
They're doing fine, by the way.

161
00:10:10,960 --> 00:10:15,760
He's got 200 years of records from the days of the Raj when we first began monitoring

162
00:10:15,760 --> 00:10:17,960
these things dead to death.

163
00:10:17,960 --> 00:10:21,640
And the glaciers are showing no particular change in 200 years.

164
00:10:21,640 --> 00:10:26,080
The only glacier that's declined a little is Gangotri, a very famous glacier, because

165
00:10:26,080 --> 00:10:29,400
there's been local geological instability, nothing to do with global warming.

166
00:10:29,400 --> 00:10:30,400
All the others are doing fine.

167
00:10:30,400 --> 00:10:35,480
We've heard a lot about Himalayan glaciers since the IPCC made that horrendous bungle

168
00:10:35,480 --> 00:10:38,640
predicting their disappearance by 2035.

169
00:10:38,840 --> 00:10:43,440
Lord Mungton says there's been no sign of change for 200 years, and none of the glaciers

170
00:10:43,440 --> 00:10:49,520
are even retreating, except one, and that's because of local geological instability.

171
00:10:49,520 --> 00:10:54,560
But once again, Mungton tells his audiences this without citing a source, except for someone

172
00:10:54,560 --> 00:10:56,400
called Professor Bhatt.

173
00:10:56,400 --> 00:10:58,640
So I wrote to Mungton to get his source.

174
00:10:58,640 --> 00:11:02,640
You quote M. I. Bhatt, but could you please cite the specific research paper where he

175
00:11:02,640 --> 00:11:05,840
published his study on this, if that is your source?

176
00:11:05,840 --> 00:11:08,120
If not, what was your source?

177
00:11:08,120 --> 00:11:10,600
I received this reply.

178
00:11:10,600 --> 00:11:14,240
Professor Bhatt is entirely clear, as the man on the ground, that there is no unusual

179
00:11:14,240 --> 00:11:18,720
pattern of glacial advance or recession in the Himalayas, and the locally produced literature

180
00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:20,840
tends to support this.

181
00:11:20,840 --> 00:11:25,440
Mungton attached a paper which didn't support his contention that Himalayan glaciers had

182
00:11:25,440 --> 00:11:27,760
been stable for 200 years.

183
00:11:27,760 --> 00:11:30,960
So I wrote back, I respect Professor Bhatt's opinion.

184
00:11:30,960 --> 00:11:35,040
The problem is I really need references to the published, peer-reviewed research that

185
00:11:35,040 --> 00:11:36,360
it's based on.

186
00:11:36,360 --> 00:11:41,500
As he, or anyone, written either a paper showing evidence that supports that opinion.

187
00:11:41,500 --> 00:11:46,880
When Mungton replied, he still gave no reference to a paper which substantiated his claim.

188
00:11:46,880 --> 00:11:50,600
But I did learn about the status of the mysterious Professor Bhatt.

189
00:11:50,600 --> 00:11:54,640
If you would like to learn more about Himalayan glaciers, talk to the guy who is responsible

190
00:11:54,640 --> 00:11:56,040
for monitoring them.

191
00:11:56,040 --> 00:11:58,400
And then he gave me the email address.

192
00:11:58,400 --> 00:12:02,200
It was becoming clear that Mungton had no research to back up his statement that the

193
00:12:02,200 --> 00:12:05,800
Himalayan glaciers had been stable for 200 years.

194
00:12:05,800 --> 00:12:10,200
Instead, he based all of his assertions on the word of Professor Bhatt in the belief

195
00:12:10,200 --> 00:12:14,360
that he's the person responsible for monitoring Himalayan glaciers.

196
00:12:14,360 --> 00:12:18,880
So in order to verify his source, that needs to be substantiated.

197
00:12:18,880 --> 00:12:21,960
Back to Mungton again for an explanation.

198
00:12:21,960 --> 00:12:25,920
Isn't Professor Bhatt's research field tectonics not glaciology?

199
00:12:25,920 --> 00:12:30,720
In what professional or official capacity is he the guy who is responsible for monitoring

200
00:12:30,720 --> 00:12:33,040
Himalayan glaciers?

201
00:12:33,040 --> 00:12:37,920
I got back a long discourse on the role of tectonics in glaciers and how the Himalayas

202
00:12:37,920 --> 00:12:42,840
are rising, another reference to the fact that the IPCC got it wrong, and puzzlement

203
00:12:42,840 --> 00:12:45,120
that I continued to demand references.

204
00:12:45,120 --> 00:12:47,520
Actually, I wasn't asking for references.

205
00:12:47,520 --> 00:12:52,540
I was asking Mungton to substantiate his claim that his source was the person responsible

206
00:12:52,540 --> 00:12:54,840
for monitoring Himalayan glaciers.

207
00:12:54,840 --> 00:12:59,020
And nowhere in his long email did he answer that question.

208
00:12:59,020 --> 00:13:02,900
Buried right at the bottom was the admission I'd been expecting.

209
00:13:02,900 --> 00:13:09,020
Yes, mountain glaciers in many regions, including the Himalayas, have been receding.

210
00:13:09,020 --> 00:13:12,140
The glaciers are showing no particular change in 200 years.

211
00:13:12,140 --> 00:13:17,540
Well, Mr Mungton, now you know why I continue to ask, very politely by the way, for your

212
00:13:17,540 --> 00:13:18,540
sources.

213
00:13:18,540 --> 00:13:22,500
In the absence of any, you finally have to acknowledge the facts.

214
00:13:22,500 --> 00:13:28,340
When pressed for a source, you eventually say that they've been receding since the 1820s.

215
00:13:28,340 --> 00:13:32,300
Even this has no source, but I'm not going to chase up your sources every time you decide

216
00:13:32,300 --> 00:13:35,600
to change your mind about what you call the truth.

217
00:13:35,600 --> 00:13:39,940
But although I finally had Mungton's confession on the glaciers, I still didn't have an answer

218
00:13:39,940 --> 00:13:43,200
to my very simple question about his source.

219
00:13:43,200 --> 00:13:47,860
And when politicians evade questions, it means they're hiding something.

220
00:13:47,860 --> 00:13:51,500
By now I'd written to Dr Batt and asked him this very question.

221
00:13:51,500 --> 00:13:56,260
Could I describe you as the person who is responsible for monitoring Himalayan glaciers?

222
00:13:56,260 --> 00:14:01,660
After which Batt had responded, the big and loud answer is NO!

223
00:14:01,660 --> 00:14:06,140
So if Batt himself doesn't seem to think he was responsible for monitoring glaciers, I

224
00:14:06,140 --> 00:14:09,680
was curious as to what evidence Mungton had that he was.

225
00:14:09,680 --> 00:14:11,180
So I asked again.

226
00:14:11,180 --> 00:14:16,460
To recap, you said the source of your Himalayan glaciers claim is Dr Batt, whom you describe

227
00:14:16,460 --> 00:14:19,580
as the guy who is responsible for monitoring them.

228
00:14:19,580 --> 00:14:24,480
Since this is your claim, I have to establish in what official or professional capacity

229
00:14:24,480 --> 00:14:28,880
Dr Batt is the person responsible for monitoring Himalayan glaciers.

230
00:14:28,880 --> 00:14:32,240
This should be a fairly easy question to answer.

231
00:14:32,240 --> 00:14:33,600
Did I get an answer?

232
00:14:33,600 --> 00:14:35,600
No, of course not.

233
00:14:35,600 --> 00:14:38,400
But I did get the familiar Mungton climb-down.

234
00:14:38,400 --> 00:14:43,160
No admission that what he said was wrong, just a quiet change of wording.

235
00:14:43,160 --> 00:14:47,760
Instead of being the guy responsible for monitoring Himalayan earthquakes, Professor Batt suddenly

236
00:14:47,760 --> 00:14:52,120
gets demoted to someone who merely seems to be knowledgeable.

237
00:14:52,120 --> 00:14:56,200
So with no admission that he got anything wrong, Mungton has now climbed all the way

238
00:14:56,200 --> 00:15:00,500
down from a speech where he told audiences that the Himalayas have shown no particular

239
00:15:00,500 --> 00:15:06,040
change in 200 years, based on the advice of the person responsible for monitoring them,

240
00:15:06,040 --> 00:15:10,480
to a claim that they have been retreating for nearly 200 years, based on the advice

241
00:15:10,480 --> 00:15:17,080
of someone who seems to be knowledgeable, and not a single peer-reviewed paper in sight.

242
00:15:17,080 --> 00:15:23,920
Anything I say, I can and will on request verify, either in the data or with equations

243
00:15:23,920 --> 00:15:25,920
or in the peer-reviewed literature.
