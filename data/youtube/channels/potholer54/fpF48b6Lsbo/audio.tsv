0	7400	So if we move quickly on then to the next slide, here we get a rather prodigious mismatch
7400	13560	again between CO2 concentration, which is the black line, and temperature concentration,
13560	17920	which is the blue line, going right back to almost 600,000 years into the past.
17920	27320	And here we had almost 7,000 parts per million of CO2 compared with 385 or thereby today.
27840	33840	7,000 then, temperature managed to get up to about 22 Celsius and has never really gone
33840	37920	much higher than that at any time over the past half billion years.
37920	42400	As best it can be reconstructed, there are of course again difficulties going that far
42400	48160	and getting accurate results, but the IPCC itself says that in the Cambrian, carbon dioxide
48160	52380	certainly went up in its opinion to around 6,000 parts per million, so this is not a
52380	54260	controversial graph.
54260	58140	What it is controversial is that again it doesn't show a terribly good link between
58140	59140	the two.
59140	63180	And look at how little correlation there is in that graph between temperature in blue
63180	66700	there and CO2 concentration in black.
66700	69660	Plainly, CO2 is only a bit part player in all this.
69660	73300	What I love about Christopher Monckton is that he doesn't give us fuzzy conclusions
73300	78220	based on ambiguities, as do Tim Ball and other critics of climate science.
78220	82680	He's like a school student who not only shows his math teacher the answer, but also his
82680	85180	workings out to show how he got there.
85180	88700	So it's very easy to see exactly where he went wrong.
88700	91460	Just check his sums and check his sources.
91460	96080	Monckton's sources for no correlation between CO2 and temperature are shown right here.
96080	101420	Two researchers, Berner who compiled a graph showing CO2 levels, and Scotty's who compiled
101420	103480	a graph showing temperatures.
103480	107300	Put the two together and you get the graph Monckton used.
107300	112380	Scotty's hasn't done any analysis of correlation, but Berner has, so let's look at the paper
112380	116740	where the data Monckton used was published, which obviously Monckton should have read
116740	119380	if he's citing this as his source.
119380	121900	We'll read Berner's conclusion together.
121900	126900	This means that over the long term there is indeed a correlation between CO2 and paleo
126900	131640	temperature as manifested by the atmospheric greenhouse effect.
131640	133780	Did Monckton somehow miss this?
133780	138680	Donna Royer, who also reviewed all the data on past temperatures and CO2 levels in a landmark
138680	144100	paper, also concluded that there's a clear correlation throughout the Phanerozoic.
144100	148760	You may find this a bit odd because the graph Monckton showed his audiences obviously shows
148760	150780	no correlation at all.
150780	155700	So either geologists are in on this global conspiracy with climatologists and are lying
155700	160080	through their teeth in order to set up a world Marxist government, or there's something they
160080	163440	know that's missing from Monckton's graph.
163440	167560	For those who share Monckton's confusion, let me again use the analogy of a heater in
167560	173280	a mountain cabin and see if you can work out what that missing something might be.
173280	177440	Remember the warming effect of CO2 is the output of our heater and the cabin is the
177440	178440	earth.
178440	182920	If there's a correlation, then whenever we turn up the heater, the cabin should warm
182920	183920	up.
183920	186960	When we turn the heater down, the cabin will cool down.
186960	190560	So let's see how they correlate over a six month period.
190560	194720	If we start our graph on January 1st, the heat is way up high and the temperature of
194720	197200	the cabin is toasty and warm.
197240	201920	During a cold snap I turn the heater up a bit, but I still freeze my nuts off.
201920	206560	In the spring I begin to turn the heater down, and so it goes on with the cabin temperature
206560	211520	remaining reasonably equitable until we reach today, July 1st.
211520	216800	This is a fairly typical output from most home heating systems between January and July.
216800	221320	Over time we can plot the output of the heater and the corresponding temperature and we can
221320	225200	seeâ€¦ there's no bloody correlation at all.
225200	226580	But how come?
226580	231720	The only possible conclusion is that the heater does not affect the temperature of the cabin.
231720	235580	When you think about it, it's obvious, because here the heater was turned up much higher
235580	239100	than today and yet the cabin was much cooler.
239100	242340	But before you believe someone who tells you this means you can turn up the heater in the
242340	246760	middle of summer and it won't make life in the cabin unbearably hot, you might want
246760	249340	to find out why the experts disagree.
249340	254460	Actually, I hope everyone is smart enough to have figured out why there's no correlation.
254460	259220	When I began heating the cabin on January 1st, it was mid-winter and solar irradiation
259220	260740	was very low.
260740	264700	When I finished plotting the graph on July 1st, it was mid-summer.
264700	269740	What's missing from our graph is the most important heat source of all, the Sun.
269740	273540	But surely the analogy isn't the same as the Earth, because the Sun obviously gives the
273540	278020	northern hemisphere more heat between January and July, but it hasn't been getting hotter
278020	280020	between the Cambrian and now.
280020	282140	Oh yes it has.
282140	286780	Unless you think solar physicists and cosmologists have also joined the international Marxist
286780	292380	conspiracy, the Sun was around 6% weaker during the Cambrian and it's been growing more powerful
292380	293380	over time.
293380	297980	A useful way of looking at this is to think of the Cambrian as Earth's winter and today
297980	299580	as its summer.
299580	304180	When you take solar irradiance into account, Royer showed there's almost a perfect correlation
304180	307020	between CO2 and global temperature.
307020	312460	A paper published in 2010 called carbon dioxide the principal control knob of the Earth's
312460	313460	temperature.
313460	317740	Not understanding the implications of the Sun's weakness leads Monckton into all sorts
317740	319460	of other misconceptions.
319460	329500	750 million years ago, a mile of ice at the equator, ice planet all round, therefore,
329500	335380	at the surface, 300,000 parts per million of CO2.
335380	342740	Can you tell me how that much CO2 could have been in the atmosphere and yet allowed that
342740	344820	amount of ice at the equator?
344820	348560	Well I'm glad he's phrased this as a question because it's a good question.
348560	352260	It's a shame Monckton never tried to find the answer before hitting the stage and going
352260	354660	to Congress with his own theories.
354660	359220	If his debating opponent Tim Lambert will allow me, I'll be happy to answer it.
359220	362900	The specific time Monckton's referring to is towards the end of what's colloquially
362900	365100	known as Snowball Earth.
365100	369840	The evidence of an Earth covered in ice is the discovery of glacial dropstones in rocks
369840	373500	that were in the tropics over 700 million years ago.
373500	378060	Given the weakness of the Sun at the time, an ice planet is no surprise.
378060	383020	Since this is our geological winter, the Sun should have kept our planet permanently frozen
383020	386180	and the high albedo of ice would have kept it that way.
386180	391100	The fact that it wasn't permanently frozen, a puzzle once called the faint Sun paradox,
391100	396660	is explained by the warming effect of greenhouse gases, primarily carbon dioxide.
396660	401620	But if carbon dioxide levels fell or some other event overcame this greenhouse effect,
401620	404940	it wouldn't have taken much to tip the world into an ice age.
404940	411140	The expanding ice reflected more of the already weak solar irradiation, a positive feedback,
411140	415820	leading to more cooling, more ice and more reflection until nearly the entire planet
415820	417620	was covered with ice.
417620	422220	Lambert explains quite rightly that the albedo of this ice planet would have been extremely
422220	423220	high.
423220	426940	Nearly all the solar radiation falling on it, which wasn't very much anyway because
426940	429580	of the weaker Sun, would have been reflected.
429580	433320	There's no way the Sun could have melted all this ice.
433320	435860	And even Monckton wouldn't suggest such a thing.
435860	440740	But something did, because within a few million years the ice had not only disappeared, the
440740	443500	Earth had turned into a hot house.
443500	445740	Geologists say the explanation is very simple.
445740	450660	The only part of the Earth not covered by ice were warm spots caused by volcanoes.
450660	455220	They weren't enough to melt the area around them, let alone an entire planet made of ice.
455220	460540	But they did release gases when they erupted, including carbon dioxide.
460540	464780	Under normal conditions, this carbon dioxide would have reacted with rocks and rainwater
464780	468800	to form carbonate minerals, which get washed out to sea.
468800	473580	But in snowball Earth conditions, there's no rain, no chemical weathering and no disposal
473580	475380	of this carbon dioxide.
475420	479700	It just kept building up in the atmosphere over millions of years to higher and higher
479700	481660	concentrations.
481660	485820	Until eventually it reached a high enough concentration to overcome the weak Sun and
485820	488220	the high albedo of ice.
488220	492140	So if you were to take a snapshot in time at the end of the last snowball, of course
492140	497220	you'd find exceptionally high CO2 levels while glaciers were at the equator.
497220	499100	But this is a dynamic process.
499100	501380	It doesn't stand still like this.
501380	505420	If we go back to the analogy of our winter cabin, let's say we've been away for months
505420	508080	and it's covered in ice and frozen solid.
508080	512300	The only way to unfreeze it is to put the heater on very high.
512300	515340	When it's going full blast, take a picture.
515340	519180	Does this tell you the heater obviously has no effect on the temperature of the cabin?
519180	523300	I'm sure everyone knows the answer, but for the sake of those who don't, the answer
523300	524460	is no.
524460	528980	It means it takes a few hours or even days for the heater to do its work and melt all
528980	530340	the ice.
530340	535100	And if the heater keeps going, then you'll turn the cabin into a sauna.
535100	539060	In exactly the same way, it took millions of years for the greenhouse warming from all
539060	542820	that CO2 to completely melt the ice.
542820	547020	Melting an ice planet takes a lot of heat and physicists have calculated just how much
547020	548320	was needed.
548320	553260	It turns out that the level of CO2 in the atmosphere had to be 350 times what it is
553260	554420	today.
554420	559540	As the ice melted, open areas of ocean absorbed more heat from the Sun, setting up positive
559540	562880	feedback, so the melting accelerated.
562880	566780	After the ice melted, the high levels of CO2 were still around and the Earth's albedo
566780	570420	was much lower, so temperatures kept rising.
570420	574140	The Earth now swung the other way into a hot house.
574140	578340	So far from showing that carbon dioxide doesn't have any effect on temperatures, Snowball
578340	580620	Earth shows the complete opposite.
580620	584560	It confirms what other studies of the Earth's history have shown, that since output from
584560	589320	the Sun has been steadily rising, carbon dioxide is the key driver of long-term climate
589320	590480	change on Earth.
590480	594720	If something else unlocked a frozen Earth, and something else turned the Earth into a
594720	600400	hot house during that geological winter, Mungton doesn't explain what he thinks it was.
600400	602760	You're going to like this.
602760	607320	I got this from Professor M. I. Bhatt of the Indian Geological Survey when I was asking
607320	609360	him what was happening to the Himalayan glaciers.
609360	610960	They're doing fine, by the way.
610960	615760	He's got 200 years of records from the days of the Raj when we first began monitoring
615760	617960	these things dead to death.
617960	621640	And the glaciers are showing no particular change in 200 years.
621640	626080	The only glacier that's declined a little is Gangotri, a very famous glacier, because
626080	629400	there's been local geological instability, nothing to do with global warming.
629400	630400	All the others are doing fine.
630400	635480	We've heard a lot about Himalayan glaciers since the IPCC made that horrendous bungle
635480	638640	predicting their disappearance by 2035.
638840	643440	Lord Mungton says there's been no sign of change for 200 years, and none of the glaciers
643440	649520	are even retreating, except one, and that's because of local geological instability.
649520	654560	But once again, Mungton tells his audiences this without citing a source, except for someone
654560	656400	called Professor Bhatt.
656400	658640	So I wrote to Mungton to get his source.
658640	662640	You quote M. I. Bhatt, but could you please cite the specific research paper where he
662640	665840	published his study on this, if that is your source?
665840	668120	If not, what was your source?
668120	670600	I received this reply.
670600	674240	Professor Bhatt is entirely clear, as the man on the ground, that there is no unusual
674240	678720	pattern of glacial advance or recession in the Himalayas, and the locally produced literature
678720	680840	tends to support this.
680840	685440	Mungton attached a paper which didn't support his contention that Himalayan glaciers had
685440	687760	been stable for 200 years.
687760	690960	So I wrote back, I respect Professor Bhatt's opinion.
690960	695040	The problem is I really need references to the published, peer-reviewed research that
695040	696360	it's based on.
696360	701500	As he, or anyone, written either a paper showing evidence that supports that opinion.
701500	706880	When Mungton replied, he still gave no reference to a paper which substantiated his claim.
706880	710600	But I did learn about the status of the mysterious Professor Bhatt.
710600	714640	If you would like to learn more about Himalayan glaciers, talk to the guy who is responsible
714640	716040	for monitoring them.
716040	718400	And then he gave me the email address.
718400	722200	It was becoming clear that Mungton had no research to back up his statement that the
722200	725800	Himalayan glaciers had been stable for 200 years.
725800	730200	Instead, he based all of his assertions on the word of Professor Bhatt in the belief
730200	734360	that he's the person responsible for monitoring Himalayan glaciers.
734360	738880	So in order to verify his source, that needs to be substantiated.
738880	741960	Back to Mungton again for an explanation.
741960	745920	Isn't Professor Bhatt's research field tectonics not glaciology?
745920	750720	In what professional or official capacity is he the guy who is responsible for monitoring
750720	753040	Himalayan glaciers?
753040	757920	I got back a long discourse on the role of tectonics in glaciers and how the Himalayas
757920	762840	are rising, another reference to the fact that the IPCC got it wrong, and puzzlement
762840	765120	that I continued to demand references.
765120	767520	Actually, I wasn't asking for references.
767520	772540	I was asking Mungton to substantiate his claim that his source was the person responsible
772540	774840	for monitoring Himalayan glaciers.
774840	779020	And nowhere in his long email did he answer that question.
779020	782900	Buried right at the bottom was the admission I'd been expecting.
782900	789020	Yes, mountain glaciers in many regions, including the Himalayas, have been receding.
789020	792140	The glaciers are showing no particular change in 200 years.
792140	797540	Well, Mr Mungton, now you know why I continue to ask, very politely by the way, for your
797540	798540	sources.
798540	802500	In the absence of any, you finally have to acknowledge the facts.
802500	808340	When pressed for a source, you eventually say that they've been receding since the 1820s.
808340	812300	Even this has no source, but I'm not going to chase up your sources every time you decide
812300	815600	to change your mind about what you call the truth.
815600	819940	But although I finally had Mungton's confession on the glaciers, I still didn't have an answer
819940	823200	to my very simple question about his source.
823200	827860	And when politicians evade questions, it means they're hiding something.
827860	831500	By now I'd written to Dr Batt and asked him this very question.
831500	836260	Could I describe you as the person who is responsible for monitoring Himalayan glaciers?
836260	841660	After which Batt had responded, the big and loud answer is NO!
841660	846140	So if Batt himself doesn't seem to think he was responsible for monitoring glaciers, I
846140	849680	was curious as to what evidence Mungton had that he was.
849680	851180	So I asked again.
851180	856460	To recap, you said the source of your Himalayan glaciers claim is Dr Batt, whom you describe
856460	859580	as the guy who is responsible for monitoring them.
859580	864480	Since this is your claim, I have to establish in what official or professional capacity
864480	868880	Dr Batt is the person responsible for monitoring Himalayan glaciers.
868880	872240	This should be a fairly easy question to answer.
872240	873600	Did I get an answer?
873600	875600	No, of course not.
875600	878400	But I did get the familiar Mungton climb-down.
878400	883160	No admission that what he said was wrong, just a quiet change of wording.
883160	887760	Instead of being the guy responsible for monitoring Himalayan earthquakes, Professor Batt suddenly
887760	892120	gets demoted to someone who merely seems to be knowledgeable.
892120	896200	So with no admission that he got anything wrong, Mungton has now climbed all the way
896200	900500	down from a speech where he told audiences that the Himalayas have shown no particular
900500	906040	change in 200 years, based on the advice of the person responsible for monitoring them,
906040	910480	to a claim that they have been retreating for nearly 200 years, based on the advice
910480	917080	of someone who seems to be knowledgeable, and not a single peer-reviewed paper in sight.
917080	923920	Anything I say, I can and will on request verify, either in the data or with equations
923920	925920	or in the peer-reviewed literature.
