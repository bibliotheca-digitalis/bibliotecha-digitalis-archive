0	1680	Dear Mr Monkton,
1680	5680	A couple of months ago you entered into a debate with me on what's up with that about
5680	11260	alleged errors in your public lectures, allegations that I made in a series of videos on my YouTube
11260	13860	channel Potola54.
13860	20160	But as soon as I presented documentary evidence to back up my claims, you suddenly fell silent.
20160	25240	Despite promising Anthony Watts that you'd respond when you returned from Australia mid-February,
25240	29760	you hadn't done so, and now you've written to tell me that you are, in effect, running
29760	30760	away.
30760	35560	Sorry, I don't know how else to phrase your abrupt retreat from our debate.
35560	39200	I'm referring to your email to me dated March 22nd.
39200	43640	I am on a very busy tour and will be more busy when I return to the UK, so I don't
43640	46220	know when I shall have further time to respond.
46220	51760	Many people like to engage in debates on inconsequentialities, and while I try to accommodate them, other
51760	55040	priorities must sometimes come first.
55040	57400	Let me address the first excuse first.
57400	62360	I understand you're currently on a busy tour, but you promised Anthony Watts you would respond
62360	65840	when you returned from your last tour, and you did not.
65840	70420	Meanwhile, I note that you have had plenty of time to respond to a university newsletter
70420	76200	that criticised you, and you spent two hours talking on Skype to a small classroom of students.
76200	82100	I fail to see why these are priorities, while my 57,000 subscribers and the hundreds of
82100	86920	thousands of subscribers to What's Up With That are not deserving of an answer from you
86960	93140	concerning clear evidence that you seriously misled your audiences over a period of several years.
93140	97480	The people watching this debate have watched you vacate your chair, and are still expecting
97480	103040	to see you reappear from backstage at any moment with some incisive rebuttal after checking
103040	104040	my evidence.
104040	108800	I'm sure they'll be as shocked as I am to hear the squealing of car tyres as you make
108800	110460	good your escape.
110460	113520	You have, after all, been given every advantage in this debate.
113560	118920	It's taking place on What's Up With That, a regular forum for you and one that you chose,
118920	122920	so there can be no suggestion that the umpire is biased against you.
122920	127020	In fact, even though he and I disagree on the climate issue, Anthony Watts has been
127020	131060	good enough to give us equal space for our responses.
131060	135640	You were given two opportunities to rebut my videos, responding first to a summary of
135640	139780	them that was made by someone in a What's Up With That comments forum, and then directly
139780	144480	to something that was, as you put it, not word for word what Peter Hadfield said, but
144480	147600	I hope they fairly convey his meaning.
147600	151960	With respect, no, the points you wrote did not fairly convey my meaning, in fact they
151960	157380	ignored the substance of the allegations altogether, and a lot of your response focused on ad hominem
157380	161620	attacks questioning my integrity, honesty and intelligence.
161620	166780	So when I responded with the actual allegations, along with supporting documentary evidence,
166780	172580	17 video clips of your speeches, 13 scientific papers and studies, and one newspaper article
172580	177320	that you yourself cited, and showed that you had clearly misquoted or misrepresented your
177320	184100	own sources, you inexplicably fell silent and then failed to deliver your promised response.
184100	187940	If you'd like to argue that these allegations have already been answered elsewhere, then
187940	191740	simply copy and paste the answers you've already given.
191740	196960	I submit that you have not answered these allegations anywhere, and one reason I know
196960	202420	that is because I had to email you to ascertain some of your sources, something very few people
202420	203820	have done.
203820	209060	Now you can prove me wrong very easily by pasting the answers into your response.
209060	214060	If you want to publicly thrash me in this debate and show that I'm wrong, then the intelligent
214060	218780	and mature way to do this is to show it with evidence.
218780	222500	Many people like to engage in debates on inconsequentialities.
222500	227800	If you think these issues are inconsequentialities, then why did you bring them up time and time
227800	231180	again during your many public speeches?
231180	233980	The sun is largely responsible for recent warming.
233980	238500	There's no correlation between CO2 and temperature over the last 500 million years.
238500	240980	Only one Himalayan glacier is retreating.
240980	242420	The earth has been cooling.
242420	243740	Greenland isn't melting.
243740	247620	There's no long-term decline of arctic ice, etc, etc.
247620	252820	It was you, not I, who decided these should be the bedrock of your case against anthropogenic
252820	254100	climate change.
254100	258100	I simply emailed you to ask for the sources of your assertions, and when you gave them
258100	260060	to me, I checked them.
260060	264780	And it turned out that you either misrepresented or misquoted these sources, or your source
264780	267940	doesn't have the authority you claim it does.
267940	272840	And if you think they're inconsequentialities, why did you decide to expend several thousand
272840	276020	words on what's up with that trying to rebut them?
276020	279620	You were quite happy to do so when you thought the debate would be easy, and you thought
279620	282220	these were just vague allegations.
282220	286240	It was only when I came back with details and a wealth of supporting evidence that you
286240	291020	apparently decided it was better to beat a hasty retreat than try to answer such prima
291020	292780	facie evidence.
292780	297740	I appreciate that you'd much prefer this kind of debate take place on stage, where oratory
297740	299340	is paramount.
299340	303400	It's much harder to engage in this kind of debate online, where everything is written
303400	308320	down and can be quoted back, where sources are demanded for any facts you give, and where
308320	310960	these sources can be checked and verified.
310960	315840	But this is the nub of our debate, whether you've chosen reliable sources and quoted
315840	318480	and represented them correctly.
318480	322240	Nowhere in my videos or in the what's up with that debate have I suggested you're making
322240	326800	these errors deliberately, or that you're being dishonest, a courtesy you didn't extend
326800	331880	to me, and neither have I descended to ad hominem attacks or name calling, also a courtesy
331880	333760	you didn't extend to me.
333760	338080	Errors are simply errors in my book, and if you unintentionally misled your audiences
338080	342720	over several years, then I accept that it was unintentional.
342720	347480	After all, the truth alone is worthy of our entire devotion, as you yourself said at the
347480	350280	Frontier Centre for Public Policy last year.
350280	355220	The truth alone is worthy of our entire devotion.
355220	360240	In the same speech you said, before we subjugate the truth to mere expediency, convenience
360240	363840	or profit, it's first desirable to discern the truth.
363840	371960	And before we subjugate the truth to mere expediency, convenience or profit, it is first
371960	374400	desirable to discern the truth.
374400	378700	And again, what matters here are the facts, what matters here is the truth.
378700	382600	What matters here are the facts, what matters here is the truth.
382600	387040	For a man so dedicated to the truth, I'm surprised that you didn't jump at the opportunity to
387040	392240	either rebut my allegations by showing that it's I, not you, who misread these sources
392240	397280	and quotes, or check your sources again and acknowledge that you made these errors.
397280	402560	In that spirit, I urge you to rejoin the debate that Anthony Watts has so kindly agreed to
402560	403560	host.
403560	406280	This may be a triumph of hope over experience.
406280	411160	My experience tells me you won't be too busy to issue a long response addressing the issue
411160	415920	of the debate itself and why you shouldn't have to continue it, or an attempt to deflect
415920	421140	the debate onto some other subject or forum, combined with another ad hominem attack on
421140	427760	me, instead of what everyone would like to see, which is either a clear rebuttal or acceptance
427760	429360	of the evidence I provided.
