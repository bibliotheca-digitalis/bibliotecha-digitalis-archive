00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,680
Dear Mr Monkton,

2
00:00:01,680 --> 00:00:05,680
A couple of months ago you entered into a debate with me on what's up with that about

3
00:00:05,680 --> 00:00:11,260
alleged errors in your public lectures, allegations that I made in a series of videos on my YouTube

4
00:00:11,260 --> 00:00:13,860
channel Potola54.

5
00:00:13,860 --> 00:00:20,160
But as soon as I presented documentary evidence to back up my claims, you suddenly fell silent.

6
00:00:20,160 --> 00:00:25,240
Despite promising Anthony Watts that you'd respond when you returned from Australia mid-February,

7
00:00:25,240 --> 00:00:29,760
you hadn't done so, and now you've written to tell me that you are, in effect, running

8
00:00:29,760 --> 00:00:30,760
away.

9
00:00:30,760 --> 00:00:35,560
Sorry, I don't know how else to phrase your abrupt retreat from our debate.

10
00:00:35,560 --> 00:00:39,200
I'm referring to your email to me dated March 22nd.

11
00:00:39,200 --> 00:00:43,640
I am on a very busy tour and will be more busy when I return to the UK, so I don't

12
00:00:43,640 --> 00:00:46,220
know when I shall have further time to respond.

13
00:00:46,220 --> 00:00:51,760
Many people like to engage in debates on inconsequentialities, and while I try to accommodate them, other

14
00:00:51,760 --> 00:00:55,040
priorities must sometimes come first.

15
00:00:55,040 --> 00:00:57,400
Let me address the first excuse first.

16
00:00:57,400 --> 00:01:02,360
I understand you're currently on a busy tour, but you promised Anthony Watts you would respond

17
00:01:02,360 --> 00:01:05,840
when you returned from your last tour, and you did not.

18
00:01:05,840 --> 00:01:10,420
Meanwhile, I note that you have had plenty of time to respond to a university newsletter

19
00:01:10,420 --> 00:01:16,200
that criticised you, and you spent two hours talking on Skype to a small classroom of students.

20
00:01:16,200 --> 00:01:22,100
I fail to see why these are priorities, while my 57,000 subscribers and the hundreds of

21
00:01:22,100 --> 00:01:26,920
thousands of subscribers to What's Up With That are not deserving of an answer from you

22
00:01:26,960 --> 00:01:33,140
concerning clear evidence that you seriously misled your audiences over a period of several years.

23
00:01:33,140 --> 00:01:37,480
The people watching this debate have watched you vacate your chair, and are still expecting

24
00:01:37,480 --> 00:01:43,040
to see you reappear from backstage at any moment with some incisive rebuttal after checking

25
00:01:43,040 --> 00:01:44,040
my evidence.

26
00:01:44,040 --> 00:01:48,800
I'm sure they'll be as shocked as I am to hear the squealing of car tyres as you make

27
00:01:48,800 --> 00:01:50,460
good your escape.

28
00:01:50,460 --> 00:01:53,520
You have, after all, been given every advantage in this debate.

29
00:01:53,560 --> 00:01:58,920
It's taking place on What's Up With That, a regular forum for you and one that you chose,

30
00:01:58,920 --> 00:02:02,920
so there can be no suggestion that the umpire is biased against you.

31
00:02:02,920 --> 00:02:07,020
In fact, even though he and I disagree on the climate issue, Anthony Watts has been

32
00:02:07,020 --> 00:02:11,060
good enough to give us equal space for our responses.

33
00:02:11,060 --> 00:02:15,640
You were given two opportunities to rebut my videos, responding first to a summary of

34
00:02:15,640 --> 00:02:19,780
them that was made by someone in a What's Up With That comments forum, and then directly

35
00:02:19,780 --> 00:02:24,480
to something that was, as you put it, not word for word what Peter Hadfield said, but

36
00:02:24,480 --> 00:02:27,600
I hope they fairly convey his meaning.

37
00:02:27,600 --> 00:02:31,960
With respect, no, the points you wrote did not fairly convey my meaning, in fact they

38
00:02:31,960 --> 00:02:37,380
ignored the substance of the allegations altogether, and a lot of your response focused on ad hominem

39
00:02:37,380 --> 00:02:41,620
attacks questioning my integrity, honesty and intelligence.

40
00:02:41,620 --> 00:02:46,780
So when I responded with the actual allegations, along with supporting documentary evidence,

41
00:02:46,780 --> 00:02:52,580
17 video clips of your speeches, 13 scientific papers and studies, and one newspaper article

42
00:02:52,580 --> 00:02:57,320
that you yourself cited, and showed that you had clearly misquoted or misrepresented your

43
00:02:57,320 --> 00:03:04,100
own sources, you inexplicably fell silent and then failed to deliver your promised response.

44
00:03:04,100 --> 00:03:07,940
If you'd like to argue that these allegations have already been answered elsewhere, then

45
00:03:07,940 --> 00:03:11,740
simply copy and paste the answers you've already given.

46
00:03:11,740 --> 00:03:16,960
I submit that you have not answered these allegations anywhere, and one reason I know

47
00:03:16,960 --> 00:03:22,420
that is because I had to email you to ascertain some of your sources, something very few people

48
00:03:22,420 --> 00:03:23,820
have done.

49
00:03:23,820 --> 00:03:29,060
Now you can prove me wrong very easily by pasting the answers into your response.

50
00:03:29,060 --> 00:03:34,060
If you want to publicly thrash me in this debate and show that I'm wrong, then the intelligent

51
00:03:34,060 --> 00:03:38,780
and mature way to do this is to show it with evidence.

52
00:03:38,780 --> 00:03:42,500
Many people like to engage in debates on inconsequentialities.

53
00:03:42,500 --> 00:03:47,800
If you think these issues are inconsequentialities, then why did you bring them up time and time

54
00:03:47,800 --> 00:03:51,180
again during your many public speeches?

55
00:03:51,180 --> 00:03:53,980
The sun is largely responsible for recent warming.

56
00:03:53,980 --> 00:03:58,500
There's no correlation between CO2 and temperature over the last 500 million years.

57
00:03:58,500 --> 00:04:00,980
Only one Himalayan glacier is retreating.

58
00:04:00,980 --> 00:04:02,420
The earth has been cooling.

59
00:04:02,420 --> 00:04:03,740
Greenland isn't melting.

60
00:04:03,740 --> 00:04:07,620
There's no long-term decline of arctic ice, etc, etc.

61
00:04:07,620 --> 00:04:12,820
It was you, not I, who decided these should be the bedrock of your case against anthropogenic

62
00:04:12,820 --> 00:04:14,100
climate change.

63
00:04:14,100 --> 00:04:18,100
I simply emailed you to ask for the sources of your assertions, and when you gave them

64
00:04:18,100 --> 00:04:20,060
to me, I checked them.

65
00:04:20,060 --> 00:04:24,780
And it turned out that you either misrepresented or misquoted these sources, or your source

66
00:04:24,780 --> 00:04:27,940
doesn't have the authority you claim it does.

67
00:04:27,940 --> 00:04:32,840
And if you think they're inconsequentialities, why did you decide to expend several thousand

68
00:04:32,840 --> 00:04:36,020
words on what's up with that trying to rebut them?

69
00:04:36,020 --> 00:04:39,620
You were quite happy to do so when you thought the debate would be easy, and you thought

70
00:04:39,620 --> 00:04:42,220
these were just vague allegations.

71
00:04:42,220 --> 00:04:46,240
It was only when I came back with details and a wealth of supporting evidence that you

72
00:04:46,240 --> 00:04:51,020
apparently decided it was better to beat a hasty retreat than try to answer such prima

73
00:04:51,020 --> 00:04:52,780
facie evidence.

74
00:04:52,780 --> 00:04:57,740
I appreciate that you'd much prefer this kind of debate take place on stage, where oratory

75
00:04:57,740 --> 00:04:59,340
is paramount.

76
00:04:59,340 --> 00:05:03,400
It's much harder to engage in this kind of debate online, where everything is written

77
00:05:03,400 --> 00:05:08,320
down and can be quoted back, where sources are demanded for any facts you give, and where

78
00:05:08,320 --> 00:05:10,960
these sources can be checked and verified.

79
00:05:10,960 --> 00:05:15,840
But this is the nub of our debate, whether you've chosen reliable sources and quoted

80
00:05:15,840 --> 00:05:18,480
and represented them correctly.

81
00:05:18,480 --> 00:05:22,240
Nowhere in my videos or in the what's up with that debate have I suggested you're making

82
00:05:22,240 --> 00:05:26,800
these errors deliberately, or that you're being dishonest, a courtesy you didn't extend

83
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:31,880
to me, and neither have I descended to ad hominem attacks or name calling, also a courtesy

84
00:05:31,880 --> 00:05:33,760
you didn't extend to me.

85
00:05:33,760 --> 00:05:38,080
Errors are simply errors in my book, and if you unintentionally misled your audiences

86
00:05:38,080 --> 00:05:42,720
over several years, then I accept that it was unintentional.

87
00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:47,480
After all, the truth alone is worthy of our entire devotion, as you yourself said at the

88
00:05:47,480 --> 00:05:50,280
Frontier Centre for Public Policy last year.

89
00:05:50,280 --> 00:05:55,220
The truth alone is worthy of our entire devotion.

90
00:05:55,220 --> 00:06:00,240
In the same speech you said, before we subjugate the truth to mere expediency, convenience

91
00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:03,840
or profit, it's first desirable to discern the truth.

92
00:06:03,840 --> 00:06:11,960
And before we subjugate the truth to mere expediency, convenience or profit, it is first

93
00:06:11,960 --> 00:06:14,400
desirable to discern the truth.

94
00:06:14,400 --> 00:06:18,700
And again, what matters here are the facts, what matters here is the truth.

95
00:06:18,700 --> 00:06:22,600
What matters here are the facts, what matters here is the truth.

96
00:06:22,600 --> 00:06:27,040
For a man so dedicated to the truth, I'm surprised that you didn't jump at the opportunity to

97
00:06:27,040 --> 00:06:32,240
either rebut my allegations by showing that it's I, not you, who misread these sources

98
00:06:32,240 --> 00:06:37,280
and quotes, or check your sources again and acknowledge that you made these errors.

99
00:06:37,280 --> 00:06:42,560
In that spirit, I urge you to rejoin the debate that Anthony Watts has so kindly agreed to

100
00:06:42,560 --> 00:06:43,560
host.

101
00:06:43,560 --> 00:06:46,280
This may be a triumph of hope over experience.

102
00:06:46,280 --> 00:06:51,160
My experience tells me you won't be too busy to issue a long response addressing the issue

103
00:06:51,160 --> 00:06:55,920
of the debate itself and why you shouldn't have to continue it, or an attempt to deflect

104
00:06:55,920 --> 00:07:01,140
the debate onto some other subject or forum, combined with another ad hominem attack on

105
00:07:01,140 --> 00:07:07,760
me, instead of what everyone would like to see, which is either a clear rebuttal or acceptance

106
00:07:07,760 --> 00:07:09,360
of the evidence I provided.
