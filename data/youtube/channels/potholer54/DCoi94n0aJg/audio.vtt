00:00.000 --> 00:01.680
Dear Mr Monkton,

00:01.680 --> 00:05.680
A couple of months ago you entered into a debate with me on what's up with that about

00:05.680 --> 00:11.260
alleged errors in your public lectures, allegations that I made in a series of videos on my YouTube

00:11.260 --> 00:13.860
channel Potola54.

00:13.860 --> 00:20.160
But as soon as I presented documentary evidence to back up my claims, you suddenly fell silent.

00:20.160 --> 00:25.240
Despite promising Anthony Watts that you'd respond when you returned from Australia mid-February,

00:25.240 --> 00:29.760
you hadn't done so, and now you've written to tell me that you are, in effect, running

00:29.760 --> 00:30.760
away.

00:30.760 --> 00:35.560
Sorry, I don't know how else to phrase your abrupt retreat from our debate.

00:35.560 --> 00:39.200
I'm referring to your email to me dated March 22nd.

00:39.200 --> 00:43.640
I am on a very busy tour and will be more busy when I return to the UK, so I don't

00:43.640 --> 00:46.220
know when I shall have further time to respond.

00:46.220 --> 00:51.760
Many people like to engage in debates on inconsequentialities, and while I try to accommodate them, other

00:51.760 --> 00:55.040
priorities must sometimes come first.

00:55.040 --> 00:57.400
Let me address the first excuse first.

00:57.400 --> 01:02.360
I understand you're currently on a busy tour, but you promised Anthony Watts you would respond

01:02.360 --> 01:05.840
when you returned from your last tour, and you did not.

01:05.840 --> 01:10.420
Meanwhile, I note that you have had plenty of time to respond to a university newsletter

01:10.420 --> 01:16.200
that criticised you, and you spent two hours talking on Skype to a small classroom of students.

01:16.200 --> 01:22.100
I fail to see why these are priorities, while my 57,000 subscribers and the hundreds of

01:22.100 --> 01:26.920
thousands of subscribers to What's Up With That are not deserving of an answer from you

01:26.960 --> 01:33.140
concerning clear evidence that you seriously misled your audiences over a period of several years.

01:33.140 --> 01:37.480
The people watching this debate have watched you vacate your chair, and are still expecting

01:37.480 --> 01:43.040
to see you reappear from backstage at any moment with some incisive rebuttal after checking

01:43.040 --> 01:44.040
my evidence.

01:44.040 --> 01:48.800
I'm sure they'll be as shocked as I am to hear the squealing of car tyres as you make

01:48.800 --> 01:50.460
good your escape.

01:50.460 --> 01:53.520
You have, after all, been given every advantage in this debate.

01:53.560 --> 01:58.920
It's taking place on What's Up With That, a regular forum for you and one that you chose,

01:58.920 --> 02:02.920
so there can be no suggestion that the umpire is biased against you.

02:02.920 --> 02:07.020
In fact, even though he and I disagree on the climate issue, Anthony Watts has been

02:07.020 --> 02:11.060
good enough to give us equal space for our responses.

02:11.060 --> 02:15.640
You were given two opportunities to rebut my videos, responding first to a summary of

02:15.640 --> 02:19.780
them that was made by someone in a What's Up With That comments forum, and then directly

02:19.780 --> 02:24.480
to something that was, as you put it, not word for word what Peter Hadfield said, but

02:24.480 --> 02:27.600
I hope they fairly convey his meaning.

02:27.600 --> 02:31.960
With respect, no, the points you wrote did not fairly convey my meaning, in fact they

02:31.960 --> 02:37.380
ignored the substance of the allegations altogether, and a lot of your response focused on ad hominem

02:37.380 --> 02:41.620
attacks questioning my integrity, honesty and intelligence.

02:41.620 --> 02:46.780
So when I responded with the actual allegations, along with supporting documentary evidence,

02:46.780 --> 02:52.580
17 video clips of your speeches, 13 scientific papers and studies, and one newspaper article

02:52.580 --> 02:57.320
that you yourself cited, and showed that you had clearly misquoted or misrepresented your

02:57.320 --> 03:04.100
own sources, you inexplicably fell silent and then failed to deliver your promised response.

03:04.100 --> 03:07.940
If you'd like to argue that these allegations have already been answered elsewhere, then

03:07.940 --> 03:11.740
simply copy and paste the answers you've already given.

03:11.740 --> 03:16.960
I submit that you have not answered these allegations anywhere, and one reason I know

03:16.960 --> 03:22.420
that is because I had to email you to ascertain some of your sources, something very few people

03:22.420 --> 03:23.820
have done.

03:23.820 --> 03:29.060
Now you can prove me wrong very easily by pasting the answers into your response.

03:29.060 --> 03:34.060
If you want to publicly thrash me in this debate and show that I'm wrong, then the intelligent

03:34.060 --> 03:38.780
and mature way to do this is to show it with evidence.

03:38.780 --> 03:42.500
Many people like to engage in debates on inconsequentialities.

03:42.500 --> 03:47.800
If you think these issues are inconsequentialities, then why did you bring them up time and time

03:47.800 --> 03:51.180
again during your many public speeches?

03:51.180 --> 03:53.980
The sun is largely responsible for recent warming.

03:53.980 --> 03:58.500
There's no correlation between CO2 and temperature over the last 500 million years.

03:58.500 --> 04:00.980
Only one Himalayan glacier is retreating.

04:00.980 --> 04:02.420
The earth has been cooling.

04:02.420 --> 04:03.740
Greenland isn't melting.

04:03.740 --> 04:07.620
There's no long-term decline of arctic ice, etc, etc.

04:07.620 --> 04:12.820
It was you, not I, who decided these should be the bedrock of your case against anthropogenic

04:12.820 --> 04:14.100
climate change.

04:14.100 --> 04:18.100
I simply emailed you to ask for the sources of your assertions, and when you gave them

04:18.100 --> 04:20.060
to me, I checked them.

04:20.060 --> 04:24.780
And it turned out that you either misrepresented or misquoted these sources, or your source

04:24.780 --> 04:27.940
doesn't have the authority you claim it does.

04:27.940 --> 04:32.840
And if you think they're inconsequentialities, why did you decide to expend several thousand

04:32.840 --> 04:36.020
words on what's up with that trying to rebut them?

04:36.020 --> 04:39.620
You were quite happy to do so when you thought the debate would be easy, and you thought

04:39.620 --> 04:42.220
these were just vague allegations.

04:42.220 --> 04:46.240
It was only when I came back with details and a wealth of supporting evidence that you

04:46.240 --> 04:51.020
apparently decided it was better to beat a hasty retreat than try to answer such prima

04:51.020 --> 04:52.780
facie evidence.

04:52.780 --> 04:57.740
I appreciate that you'd much prefer this kind of debate take place on stage, where oratory

04:57.740 --> 04:59.340
is paramount.

04:59.340 --> 05:03.400
It's much harder to engage in this kind of debate online, where everything is written

05:03.400 --> 05:08.320
down and can be quoted back, where sources are demanded for any facts you give, and where

05:08.320 --> 05:10.960
these sources can be checked and verified.

05:10.960 --> 05:15.840
But this is the nub of our debate, whether you've chosen reliable sources and quoted

05:15.840 --> 05:18.480
and represented them correctly.

05:18.480 --> 05:22.240
Nowhere in my videos or in the what's up with that debate have I suggested you're making

05:22.240 --> 05:26.800
these errors deliberately, or that you're being dishonest, a courtesy you didn't extend

05:26.800 --> 05:31.880
to me, and neither have I descended to ad hominem attacks or name calling, also a courtesy

05:31.880 --> 05:33.760
you didn't extend to me.

05:33.760 --> 05:38.080
Errors are simply errors in my book, and if you unintentionally misled your audiences

05:38.080 --> 05:42.720
over several years, then I accept that it was unintentional.

05:42.720 --> 05:47.480
After all, the truth alone is worthy of our entire devotion, as you yourself said at the

05:47.480 --> 05:50.280
Frontier Centre for Public Policy last year.

05:50.280 --> 05:55.220
The truth alone is worthy of our entire devotion.

05:55.220 --> 06:00.240
In the same speech you said, before we subjugate the truth to mere expediency, convenience

06:00.240 --> 06:03.840
or profit, it's first desirable to discern the truth.

06:03.840 --> 06:11.960
And before we subjugate the truth to mere expediency, convenience or profit, it is first

06:11.960 --> 06:14.400
desirable to discern the truth.

06:14.400 --> 06:18.700
And again, what matters here are the facts, what matters here is the truth.

06:18.700 --> 06:22.600
What matters here are the facts, what matters here is the truth.

06:22.600 --> 06:27.040
For a man so dedicated to the truth, I'm surprised that you didn't jump at the opportunity to

06:27.040 --> 06:32.240
either rebut my allegations by showing that it's I, not you, who misread these sources

06:32.240 --> 06:37.280
and quotes, or check your sources again and acknowledge that you made these errors.

06:37.280 --> 06:42.560
In that spirit, I urge you to rejoin the debate that Anthony Watts has so kindly agreed to

06:42.560 --> 06:43.560
host.

06:43.560 --> 06:46.280
This may be a triumph of hope over experience.

06:46.280 --> 06:51.160
My experience tells me you won't be too busy to issue a long response addressing the issue

06:51.160 --> 06:55.920
of the debate itself and why you shouldn't have to continue it, or an attempt to deflect

06:55.920 --> 07:01.140
the debate onto some other subject or forum, combined with another ad hominem attack on

07:01.140 --> 07:07.760
me, instead of what everyone would like to see, which is either a clear rebuttal or acceptance

07:07.760 --> 07:09.360
of the evidence I provided.
