00:00.000 --> 00:05.640
The ship, sent to the Antarctic to study climate change, has been stranded in the ice for ten

00:05.640 --> 00:10.880
days. Attempts to rescue the passengers using icebreaker ships failed. Rescuers finally

00:10.880 --> 00:15.380
got through using a whopping great big helicopter that was landing on the supposedly very thin

00:15.380 --> 00:20.920
ice. They're all out, okay? So it looks to me like we're looking at global cooling. Forget

00:20.920 --> 00:25.440
this global warming. That's just my opinion. Yes, wouldn't it be nice if we didn't have

00:25.440 --> 00:30.800
to waste our time on scientific research? Just look at a video of a helicopter landing

00:30.800 --> 00:36.640
on sea ice, and you've proved the Earth is cooling. No need for all them fancy thermometers

00:36.640 --> 00:42.160
in places all over the world that aren't America to monitor climate change. Or as Vani calls

00:42.160 --> 00:47.780
it, climate change. If opinion was fact, of course Vani would be absolutely right. But

00:47.780 --> 00:53.320
in the real world we rely on the painstaking process of measuring and comparing measurements

00:53.320 --> 00:59.660
over time, and calculating trends. And in a minute we'll see how Vani's opinion matches

00:59.660 --> 01:05.720
actual measurement. First I want to quickly revisit a video I posted last year explaining

01:05.720 --> 01:11.200
why scientists have concluded for over a century that CO2 drives global temperature, and I

01:11.200 --> 01:16.320
had a challenge for the citizen scientists who want to avoid that obvious inference at

01:16.320 --> 01:21.680
all costs. Try to address the evidence. Explain why you think the experiments showing the

01:21.680 --> 01:27.400
radiation absorption of CO2 are flawed. And explain how the Earth thawed from its pre-Cambrian

01:27.400 --> 01:32.320
snowball. And explain why the Earth was much hotter than today during the Cambrian, even

01:32.320 --> 01:37.160
though solar output was much lower. And explain why there's a very good correlation between

01:37.160 --> 01:42.480
global temperatures and CO2 levels over the last 500 million years. And explain how the

01:42.480 --> 01:47.680
Earth warmed enough to emerge from recent glaciations. And explain why we've had 35

01:47.680 --> 01:52.180
years of warming, even though solar irradiation has been lower.

01:52.180 --> 01:59.080
The video had over 88,000 hits at the time of writing, and 104 thumbs down. So guess

01:59.080 --> 02:04.320
how many of those contrarians who disagreed with the science managed to explain all these

02:04.320 --> 02:11.760
observations? No, not five. That's right, zero. No one could come up with an alternative

02:11.760 --> 02:18.040
explanation for past climate change, nor could they show why CO2 is not the cause.

02:18.040 --> 02:22.480
What they seem to be saying is we can't explain all these things, but we definitely don't

02:22.480 --> 02:27.080
want it to be carbon dioxide, so we'll go with some mysterious force of nature we can't

02:27.080 --> 02:35.240
explain called ABCD. Anything but carbon dioxide. To be fair, one person did promise to rebut

02:35.240 --> 02:41.320
the evidence with a video, but of course he never made one. Now I did ask very nicely

02:41.440 --> 02:46.360
for people to address the evidence presented in the video and avoid the usual internet

02:46.360 --> 02:53.240
rhetoric. Please don't respond with more predictable posts about how it's all an IPCC hoax, an attack

02:53.240 --> 02:59.240
scam and computer models are wrong. But what do you think I got in response? Yes, of course.

02:59.240 --> 03:04.400
Bullshit. Fraud. Gravy train. Absolute bullshit. IPCC. Politically driven.

03:04.400 --> 03:08.880
This is a perfect example of what I said at the beginning of that video. When faced with

03:08.920 --> 03:14.280
evidence, the response from citizen scientists is never to look at it, or confront it, or

03:14.280 --> 03:20.000
challenge it, but simply to pretend it's not there. Most opted instead for the current

03:20.000 --> 03:25.540
internet myth that carbon dioxide's changed its properties in the last 18 years and no

03:25.540 --> 03:30.920
longer affects global temperature the way it has for the last 500 million years. The

03:30.920 --> 03:35.120
argument is that even though carbon dioxide levels have been going up for the last 17

03:35.120 --> 03:41.240
or 18 or 15 or 20 years, wherever you want to draw your lines, temperatures have either

03:41.240 --> 03:47.080
not been going up as much as expected, or even been going down. Either way, global warming

03:47.080 --> 03:52.840
stopped. The problem has always been finding the source of this myth, because most people,

03:52.840 --> 03:58.240
including those who repeat it on this channel, never give their sources. So I was delighted

03:58.240 --> 04:03.000
when one of the most prodigious posters on my channel, Prairie Dog Res, or let's call

04:03.000 --> 04:08.640
him PDR, was more than willing to divulge his sources, starting with the Met Office

04:08.640 --> 04:14.400
Report. Now funnily enough, another prodigious poster posted elsewhere on my channel at exactly

04:14.400 --> 04:20.820
the same time. Both reappeared after a long absence. Funnier still, they both joined YouTube

04:20.820 --> 04:26.920
on exactly the same day. It's almost as if they're the same person. Anyway, it turned

04:26.920 --> 04:31.720
out that the Met Office Report did not support the Earth Has Been Cooling myth, and neither

04:31.760 --> 04:36.840
did all the other sources PDR tried, which is why it always pays to read these studies

04:36.840 --> 04:42.680
before citing them. In the end, it came down to just one set of data from Remote Sensing

04:42.680 --> 04:49.020
Systems, RSS. PDR justified this on the grounds that the satellite data is more accurate than

04:49.020 --> 04:55.200
ground station data. But of course, UAH also uses satellite data, and because of the difference

04:55.200 --> 05:00.840
in scale on the y-axis of these graphs, when you look at both satellite datasets, the average

05:00.840 --> 05:07.840
is clearly positive. So why is it one satellite dataset is better than another? PDR wouldn't

05:07.960 --> 05:14.640
tell me. He just said he naturally chose to go with the data that shows cooling. But in

05:14.640 --> 05:19.720
science, cherry picking is of course verboten, and if you do it to support an argument, you'll

05:19.720 --> 05:25.700
always be caught out when you finally reveal your sources. Having disposed of this cooling

05:25.700 --> 05:31.140
myth, what have atmospheric temperatures been doing over the last 15 years? Well, if you

05:31.140 --> 05:36.540
don't cherry pick, but take all the data together, they haven't been falling, but the rate of

05:36.540 --> 05:42.720
increase has slowed down considerably compared to the 1990s. This is what's called the pause

05:42.720 --> 05:49.100
or hiatus. Remember, we're talking about atmospheric temperatures, which only account for about

05:49.100 --> 05:54.580
10% of global warming. Most of the warming goes into the oceans. The Earth as a whole

05:54.580 --> 05:59.340
is still warming because researchers can measure how much energy is coming in and how

05:59.340 --> 06:05.060
much is going out, and the Earth is still receiving more energy than it's losing. It's

06:05.060 --> 06:11.380
just that the rise in atmospheric temperatures has slowed considerably over the last 15 years.

06:11.380 --> 06:15.780
But how is that possible if carbon dioxide levels have been rising in a more or less

06:15.780 --> 06:21.620
straight line? Shouldn't atmospheric temperatures do the same? Well, let's use an analogy with

06:21.620 --> 06:31.860
something that we can all agree causes warming, and that's the Sun. I think we can also agree

06:31.860 --> 06:36.700
that in the northern hemisphere, between the 1st of January and the 1st of July, the Sun

06:36.700 --> 06:42.200
gets gradually higher in the sky, and it shines for longer during the day. Now, suppose a

06:42.200 --> 06:49.260
family who've been locked in a TV studio for 20 years escapes and moves to Denver in January.

06:49.260 --> 06:53.660
Since they've never experienced the changing seasons, they might well form a hypothesis

06:53.660 --> 06:59.060
that as the Sun gets higher and the days get longer, temperatures in Denver ought to rise

06:59.060 --> 07:05.140
over the next six months. Let's say they call this their solar warming hypothesis. And they

07:05.140 --> 07:08.980
might also conclude that since the number of hours of daylight and the elevation of

07:08.980 --> 07:14.300
the Sun follow a simple curve, then the rise in temperature should follow the same smooth

07:14.300 --> 07:19.860
curve. Pretty obvious, right? But as they monitored daytime temperatures, they noticed

07:19.860 --> 07:25.920
something odd. The temperature did go up at first, but then it suddenly went down. So

07:25.920 --> 07:30.580
the fathers and the sons came to the conclusion that the Sun couldn't be the cause of warming

07:30.580 --> 07:35.860
after all, and I'm sure many of you would agree. And although the temperature did come

07:35.860 --> 07:41.620
back up, it then stayed flat for several weeks, even though the Sun continued to get higher

07:41.620 --> 07:47.140
in the sky and shine for longer. The mothers and the daughters, however, began to suspect

07:47.140 --> 07:52.760
something else was going on. They checked monthly weather reports over the last 20 years

07:52.760 --> 07:57.980
and noticed that on a monthly basis at least, temperatures have always risen between January

07:57.980 --> 08:04.460
and July. And sure enough, pretty soon temperatures started rising once again. But a few weeks

08:04.460 --> 08:09.560
later, the boys again challenged the solar warming hypothesis because temperatures started

08:09.560 --> 08:15.400
falling once more. And again, they argued that if the Sun was responsible for warming

08:15.400 --> 08:20.920
and the Sun was getting stronger, why were temperatures now falling? Now you may say

08:20.920 --> 08:26.940
duh, but it's a good question that deserves an answer. Since we know in theory that the

08:26.940 --> 08:31.520
increasing power of the Sun should cause temperatures to rise, and since the girls discovered that

08:31.520 --> 08:37.080
it's done that in the past, why doesn't the seasonal temperature rise follow growing insulation

08:37.080 --> 08:42.460
in a smooth curve? Why do we get all these dips and wobbles? Now I'd like to give the

08:42.460 --> 08:46.000
citizen scientists a few seconds to answer that one.

08:46.000 --> 08:55.380
OK, time's up, and I'm sure most of you get this. The answer is that increasing insulation

08:55.380 --> 09:00.780
is the driver of temperature over the longer term, in this case measured in months. But

09:00.780 --> 09:05.200
in the short term, over a matter of days, there are other factors that are trying to

09:05.200 --> 09:11.880
drive temperatures down. Carbon dioxide is also pushing up temperatures in the long term,

09:11.880 --> 09:17.440
but in this case the effect is much slower, a matter of decades and centuries. Now a lot

09:17.440 --> 09:22.460
of people ask, if you can't predict temperatures in the short term, how can you possibly predict

09:22.460 --> 09:27.640
temperatures in the long term? But in fact it's much easier to predict long term trends

09:27.640 --> 09:33.200
than short term fluctuations, for obvious reasons. In January, a meteorologist may not

09:33.200 --> 09:38.540
be able to predict if February will be warmer or colder, because all kinds of unknown short

09:38.540 --> 09:43.960
term weather patterns will affect that prediction. But he can predict with confidence that it'll

09:43.960 --> 09:50.760
be warmer in May, and with even more confidence that it'll be much warmer in July.

09:50.760 --> 09:55.980
Because carbon dioxide works on a longer time scale, substitute one month for one decade,

09:55.980 --> 10:00.360
and we can see that every decade has been warmer than the previous one. The longer a

10:00.360 --> 10:05.520
period of time you have, whether it's months for seasonal forcing, or decades for carbon

10:05.520 --> 10:10.580
dioxide forcing, the easier it is to make a prediction, because the effect of all these

10:10.580 --> 10:16.040
short term variations gets less significant. And if that's hard to follow, let me explain

10:16.040 --> 10:22.000
it another way. Look at these background forcings as a kind of rising platform on which short

10:22.000 --> 10:27.720
term influences play out. In the case of seasonal changes, these short term influences are of

10:27.720 --> 10:32.840
course weather patterns that last a matter of days or weeks. In the case of greenhouse

10:32.840 --> 10:38.280
changes, they're things like the El Nino Southern Oscillation and solar output that last in

10:38.280 --> 10:44.080
cycles of years or decades. Let's imagine then a typical cyclical graph that bumps up

10:44.080 --> 10:49.380
and down without any major changes. Sometimes it goes up, sometimes down, and sometimes

10:49.380 --> 10:55.220
it's flat. Now let's introduce some imaginary background effect that's rising at a steady

10:55.220 --> 11:03.280
rate in a straight line. Add the two together, and what do we get? Exactly what we see when

11:03.280 --> 11:07.820
a steady background increase in temperature is added to the ups and downs of a temperature

11:07.820 --> 11:13.440
graph. So the contrarians are right, we don't see a straight line rise in global temperature

11:13.440 --> 11:19.260
to match the straight line rise in CO2, any more than we see a straight line rise in temperature

11:19.260 --> 11:25.140
match seasonal insulation. But it's not enough to say we expect to see these long term trends

11:25.140 --> 11:30.040
fluctuate. In a subject as important and controversial as climate change, researchers

11:30.040 --> 11:35.320
have to show exactly what these influences are and what effect they're having. And when

11:35.320 --> 11:40.680
we look at these short term factors, it turns out they're all conspiring to send temperatures

11:40.680 --> 11:46.760
lower. For a start, solar output has been going down. Secondly, aerosol pollution has

11:46.760 --> 11:52.240
been on the rise, thanks to newly industrialising China and India. And following the strong

11:52.240 --> 11:58.280
El Niño event of 1998, there'd been a series of strong La Niña years in which the oceans

11:58.280 --> 12:03.320
took up a lot of the heat that was in the atmosphere. So with all these factors conspiring

12:03.320 --> 12:09.660
to send atmospheric temperatures lower, why haven't they gone down? Atmospheric temperatures

12:09.660 --> 12:16.340
not only remain stubbornly high, they've even hit a string of record highs. Something must

12:16.340 --> 12:22.860
be keeping atmospheric temperatures up. So what is it? Once again, the obvious conclusion,

12:22.860 --> 12:28.600
since it's been driving long term temperatures for at least 500 million years, is the increasing

12:28.600 --> 12:36.480
concentration of CO2. So my question for all those who adhere to the ideology of ABCD is,

12:36.480 --> 12:43.100
why not carbon dioxide? And if it's not carbon dioxide, then what is it? To scientists, there's

12:43.100 --> 12:48.280
no mystery about what's causing these record high temperatures. They expect more CO2 to

12:48.280 --> 12:53.320
warm the air, because we know from laboratory experiments that it does. And the evidence

12:53.320 --> 12:58.480
shows that CO2 has been the main driver of climate for the last 500 million years. And

12:58.480 --> 13:04.840
researchers even predicted the recent rise in global temperature as far back as the 1950s.

13:04.840 --> 13:09.640
And they know that the Earth is still warming, because more heat is coming in than is going

13:09.640 --> 13:16.020
out. What they don't understand is exactly where all this extra heat is going. Yes, of

13:16.020 --> 13:21.420
course, it's going into the oceans, because the oceans soak up about 90% of the increasing

13:21.420 --> 13:26.220
heat content of the Earth. And while there's been a pause in the steep rise of atmospheric

13:26.220 --> 13:32.340
temperatures, the oceans have continued to warm. The question is, exactly where in the

13:32.340 --> 13:37.620
oceans is this extra heat going? How's it circulating? And the other question that's

13:37.620 --> 13:42.580
currently a hot topic in climate science is how much influence aerosol pollution from

13:42.580 --> 13:49.140
China and India is having in mitigating the warming effects of CO2. One recent paper suggested

13:49.140 --> 13:54.800
their influence may be amplified because aerosols are being spread more in the northern hemisphere,

13:54.800 --> 14:00.520
which is where CO2 is concentrated. Since the armchair scientists don't want carbon

14:00.520 --> 14:05.620
dioxide to be the cause for ideological reasons, then why don't you guys have another crack

14:05.620 --> 14:10.360
at explaining all the phenomena outlined in my previous video without invoking the

14:10.360 --> 14:16.780
dreaded CO2? And have a go at answering the questions in this video too. And before you

14:16.780 --> 14:22.660
say galactic rays, or cosmic rays, or God, or the Sun, please take a look at the notes

14:22.660 --> 14:25.180
at the end of this video and try again.
