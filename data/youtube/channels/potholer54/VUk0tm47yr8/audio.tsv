0	5640	The ship, sent to the Antarctic to study climate change, has been stranded in the ice for ten
5640	10880	days. Attempts to rescue the passengers using icebreaker ships failed. Rescuers finally
10880	15380	got through using a whopping great big helicopter that was landing on the supposedly very thin
15380	20920	ice. They're all out, okay? So it looks to me like we're looking at global cooling. Forget
20920	25440	this global warming. That's just my opinion. Yes, wouldn't it be nice if we didn't have
25440	30800	to waste our time on scientific research? Just look at a video of a helicopter landing
30800	36640	on sea ice, and you've proved the Earth is cooling. No need for all them fancy thermometers
36640	42160	in places all over the world that aren't America to monitor climate change. Or as Vani calls
42160	47780	it, climate change. If opinion was fact, of course Vani would be absolutely right. But
47780	53320	in the real world we rely on the painstaking process of measuring and comparing measurements
53320	59660	over time, and calculating trends. And in a minute we'll see how Vani's opinion matches
59660	65720	actual measurement. First I want to quickly revisit a video I posted last year explaining
65720	71200	why scientists have concluded for over a century that CO2 drives global temperature, and I
71200	76320	had a challenge for the citizen scientists who want to avoid that obvious inference at
76320	81680	all costs. Try to address the evidence. Explain why you think the experiments showing the
81680	87400	radiation absorption of CO2 are flawed. And explain how the Earth thawed from its pre-Cambrian
87400	92320	snowball. And explain why the Earth was much hotter than today during the Cambrian, even
92320	97160	though solar output was much lower. And explain why there's a very good correlation between
97160	102480	global temperatures and CO2 levels over the last 500 million years. And explain how the
102480	107680	Earth warmed enough to emerge from recent glaciations. And explain why we've had 35
107680	112180	years of warming, even though solar irradiation has been lower.
112180	119080	The video had over 88,000 hits at the time of writing, and 104 thumbs down. So guess
119080	124320	how many of those contrarians who disagreed with the science managed to explain all these
124320	131760	observations? No, not five. That's right, zero. No one could come up with an alternative
131760	138040	explanation for past climate change, nor could they show why CO2 is not the cause.
138040	142480	What they seem to be saying is we can't explain all these things, but we definitely don't
142480	147080	want it to be carbon dioxide, so we'll go with some mysterious force of nature we can't
147080	155240	explain called ABCD. Anything but carbon dioxide. To be fair, one person did promise to rebut
155240	161320	the evidence with a video, but of course he never made one. Now I did ask very nicely
161440	166360	for people to address the evidence presented in the video and avoid the usual internet
166360	173240	rhetoric. Please don't respond with more predictable posts about how it's all an IPCC hoax, an attack
173240	179240	scam and computer models are wrong. But what do you think I got in response? Yes, of course.
179240	184400	Bullshit. Fraud. Gravy train. Absolute bullshit. IPCC. Politically driven.
184400	188880	This is a perfect example of what I said at the beginning of that video. When faced with
188920	194280	evidence, the response from citizen scientists is never to look at it, or confront it, or
194280	200000	challenge it, but simply to pretend it's not there. Most opted instead for the current
200000	205540	internet myth that carbon dioxide's changed its properties in the last 18 years and no
205540	210920	longer affects global temperature the way it has for the last 500 million years. The
210920	215120	argument is that even though carbon dioxide levels have been going up for the last 17
215120	221240	or 18 or 15 or 20 years, wherever you want to draw your lines, temperatures have either
221240	227080	not been going up as much as expected, or even been going down. Either way, global warming
227080	232840	stopped. The problem has always been finding the source of this myth, because most people,
232840	238240	including those who repeat it on this channel, never give their sources. So I was delighted
238240	243000	when one of the most prodigious posters on my channel, Prairie Dog Res, or let's call
243000	248640	him PDR, was more than willing to divulge his sources, starting with the Met Office
248640	254400	Report. Now funnily enough, another prodigious poster posted elsewhere on my channel at exactly
254400	260820	the same time. Both reappeared after a long absence. Funnier still, they both joined YouTube
260820	266920	on exactly the same day. It's almost as if they're the same person. Anyway, it turned
266920	271720	out that the Met Office Report did not support the Earth Has Been Cooling myth, and neither
271760	276840	did all the other sources PDR tried, which is why it always pays to read these studies
276840	282680	before citing them. In the end, it came down to just one set of data from Remote Sensing
282680	289020	Systems, RSS. PDR justified this on the grounds that the satellite data is more accurate than
289020	295200	ground station data. But of course, UAH also uses satellite data, and because of the difference
295200	300840	in scale on the y-axis of these graphs, when you look at both satellite datasets, the average
300840	307840	is clearly positive. So why is it one satellite dataset is better than another? PDR wouldn't
307960	314640	tell me. He just said he naturally chose to go with the data that shows cooling. But in
314640	319720	science, cherry picking is of course verboten, and if you do it to support an argument, you'll
319720	325700	always be caught out when you finally reveal your sources. Having disposed of this cooling
325700	331140	myth, what have atmospheric temperatures been doing over the last 15 years? Well, if you
331140	336540	don't cherry pick, but take all the data together, they haven't been falling, but the rate of
336540	342720	increase has slowed down considerably compared to the 1990s. This is what's called the pause
342720	349100	or hiatus. Remember, we're talking about atmospheric temperatures, which only account for about
349100	354580	10% of global warming. Most of the warming goes into the oceans. The Earth as a whole
354580	359340	is still warming because researchers can measure how much energy is coming in and how
359340	365060	much is going out, and the Earth is still receiving more energy than it's losing. It's
365060	371380	just that the rise in atmospheric temperatures has slowed considerably over the last 15 years.
371380	375780	But how is that possible if carbon dioxide levels have been rising in a more or less
375780	381620	straight line? Shouldn't atmospheric temperatures do the same? Well, let's use an analogy with
381620	391860	something that we can all agree causes warming, and that's the Sun. I think we can also agree
391860	396700	that in the northern hemisphere, between the 1st of January and the 1st of July, the Sun
396700	402200	gets gradually higher in the sky, and it shines for longer during the day. Now, suppose a
402200	409260	family who've been locked in a TV studio for 20 years escapes and moves to Denver in January.
409260	413660	Since they've never experienced the changing seasons, they might well form a hypothesis
413660	419060	that as the Sun gets higher and the days get longer, temperatures in Denver ought to rise
419060	425140	over the next six months. Let's say they call this their solar warming hypothesis. And they
425140	428980	might also conclude that since the number of hours of daylight and the elevation of
428980	434300	the Sun follow a simple curve, then the rise in temperature should follow the same smooth
434300	439860	curve. Pretty obvious, right? But as they monitored daytime temperatures, they noticed
439860	445920	something odd. The temperature did go up at first, but then it suddenly went down. So
445920	450580	the fathers and the sons came to the conclusion that the Sun couldn't be the cause of warming
450580	455860	after all, and I'm sure many of you would agree. And although the temperature did come
455860	461620	back up, it then stayed flat for several weeks, even though the Sun continued to get higher
461620	467140	in the sky and shine for longer. The mothers and the daughters, however, began to suspect
467140	472760	something else was going on. They checked monthly weather reports over the last 20 years
472760	477980	and noticed that on a monthly basis at least, temperatures have always risen between January
477980	484460	and July. And sure enough, pretty soon temperatures started rising once again. But a few weeks
484460	489560	later, the boys again challenged the solar warming hypothesis because temperatures started
489560	495400	falling once more. And again, they argued that if the Sun was responsible for warming
495400	500920	and the Sun was getting stronger, why were temperatures now falling? Now you may say
500920	506940	duh, but it's a good question that deserves an answer. Since we know in theory that the
506940	511520	increasing power of the Sun should cause temperatures to rise, and since the girls discovered that
511520	517080	it's done that in the past, why doesn't the seasonal temperature rise follow growing insulation
517080	522460	in a smooth curve? Why do we get all these dips and wobbles? Now I'd like to give the
522460	526000	citizen scientists a few seconds to answer that one.
526000	535380	OK, time's up, and I'm sure most of you get this. The answer is that increasing insulation
535380	540780	is the driver of temperature over the longer term, in this case measured in months. But
540780	545200	in the short term, over a matter of days, there are other factors that are trying to
545200	551880	drive temperatures down. Carbon dioxide is also pushing up temperatures in the long term,
551880	557440	but in this case the effect is much slower, a matter of decades and centuries. Now a lot
557440	562460	of people ask, if you can't predict temperatures in the short term, how can you possibly predict
562460	567640	temperatures in the long term? But in fact it's much easier to predict long term trends
567640	573200	than short term fluctuations, for obvious reasons. In January, a meteorologist may not
573200	578540	be able to predict if February will be warmer or colder, because all kinds of unknown short
578540	583960	term weather patterns will affect that prediction. But he can predict with confidence that it'll
583960	590760	be warmer in May, and with even more confidence that it'll be much warmer in July.
590760	595980	Because carbon dioxide works on a longer time scale, substitute one month for one decade,
595980	600360	and we can see that every decade has been warmer than the previous one. The longer a
600360	605520	period of time you have, whether it's months for seasonal forcing, or decades for carbon
605520	610580	dioxide forcing, the easier it is to make a prediction, because the effect of all these
610580	616040	short term variations gets less significant. And if that's hard to follow, let me explain
616040	622000	it another way. Look at these background forcings as a kind of rising platform on which short
622000	627720	term influences play out. In the case of seasonal changes, these short term influences are of
627720	632840	course weather patterns that last a matter of days or weeks. In the case of greenhouse
632840	638280	changes, they're things like the El Nino Southern Oscillation and solar output that last in
638280	644080	cycles of years or decades. Let's imagine then a typical cyclical graph that bumps up
644080	649380	and down without any major changes. Sometimes it goes up, sometimes down, and sometimes
649380	655220	it's flat. Now let's introduce some imaginary background effect that's rising at a steady
655220	663280	rate in a straight line. Add the two together, and what do we get? Exactly what we see when
663280	667820	a steady background increase in temperature is added to the ups and downs of a temperature
667820	673440	graph. So the contrarians are right, we don't see a straight line rise in global temperature
673440	679260	to match the straight line rise in CO2, any more than we see a straight line rise in temperature
679260	685140	match seasonal insulation. But it's not enough to say we expect to see these long term trends
685140	690040	fluctuate. In a subject as important and controversial as climate change, researchers
690040	695320	have to show exactly what these influences are and what effect they're having. And when
695320	700680	we look at these short term factors, it turns out they're all conspiring to send temperatures
700680	706760	lower. For a start, solar output has been going down. Secondly, aerosol pollution has
706760	712240	been on the rise, thanks to newly industrialising China and India. And following the strong
712240	718280	El Niño event of 1998, there'd been a series of strong La Niña years in which the oceans
718280	723320	took up a lot of the heat that was in the atmosphere. So with all these factors conspiring
723320	729660	to send atmospheric temperatures lower, why haven't they gone down? Atmospheric temperatures
729660	736340	not only remain stubbornly high, they've even hit a string of record highs. Something must
736340	742860	be keeping atmospheric temperatures up. So what is it? Once again, the obvious conclusion,
742860	748600	since it's been driving long term temperatures for at least 500 million years, is the increasing
748600	756480	concentration of CO2. So my question for all those who adhere to the ideology of ABCD is,
756480	763100	why not carbon dioxide? And if it's not carbon dioxide, then what is it? To scientists, there's
763100	768280	no mystery about what's causing these record high temperatures. They expect more CO2 to
768280	773320	warm the air, because we know from laboratory experiments that it does. And the evidence
773320	778480	shows that CO2 has been the main driver of climate for the last 500 million years. And
778480	784840	researchers even predicted the recent rise in global temperature as far back as the 1950s.
784840	789640	And they know that the Earth is still warming, because more heat is coming in than is going
789640	796020	out. What they don't understand is exactly where all this extra heat is going. Yes, of
796020	801420	course, it's going into the oceans, because the oceans soak up about 90% of the increasing
801420	806220	heat content of the Earth. And while there's been a pause in the steep rise of atmospheric
806220	812340	temperatures, the oceans have continued to warm. The question is, exactly where in the
812340	817620	oceans is this extra heat going? How's it circulating? And the other question that's
817620	822580	currently a hot topic in climate science is how much influence aerosol pollution from
822580	829140	China and India is having in mitigating the warming effects of CO2. One recent paper suggested
829140	834800	their influence may be amplified because aerosols are being spread more in the northern hemisphere,
834800	840520	which is where CO2 is concentrated. Since the armchair scientists don't want carbon
840520	845620	dioxide to be the cause for ideological reasons, then why don't you guys have another crack
845620	850360	at explaining all the phenomena outlined in my previous video without invoking the
850360	856780	dreaded CO2? And have a go at answering the questions in this video too. And before you
856780	862660	say galactic rays, or cosmic rays, or God, or the Sun, please take a look at the notes
862660	865180	at the end of this video and try again.
