1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,640
The ship, sent to the Antarctic to study climate change, has been stranded in the ice for ten

2
00:00:05,640 --> 00:00:10,880
days. Attempts to rescue the passengers using icebreaker ships failed. Rescuers finally

3
00:00:10,880 --> 00:00:15,380
got through using a whopping great big helicopter that was landing on the supposedly very thin

4
00:00:15,380 --> 00:00:20,920
ice. They're all out, okay? So it looks to me like we're looking at global cooling. Forget

5
00:00:20,920 --> 00:00:25,440
this global warming. That's just my opinion. Yes, wouldn't it be nice if we didn't have

6
00:00:25,440 --> 00:00:30,800
to waste our time on scientific research? Just look at a video of a helicopter landing

7
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:36,640
on sea ice, and you've proved the Earth is cooling. No need for all them fancy thermometers

8
00:00:36,640 --> 00:00:42,160
in places all over the world that aren't America to monitor climate change. Or as Vani calls

9
00:00:42,160 --> 00:00:47,780
it, climate change. If opinion was fact, of course Vani would be absolutely right. But

10
00:00:47,780 --> 00:00:53,320
in the real world we rely on the painstaking process of measuring and comparing measurements

11
00:00:53,320 --> 00:00:59,660
over time, and calculating trends. And in a minute we'll see how Vani's opinion matches

12
00:00:59,660 --> 00:01:05,720
actual measurement. First I want to quickly revisit a video I posted last year explaining

13
00:01:05,720 --> 00:01:11,200
why scientists have concluded for over a century that CO2 drives global temperature, and I

14
00:01:11,200 --> 00:01:16,320
had a challenge for the citizen scientists who want to avoid that obvious inference at

15
00:01:16,320 --> 00:01:21,680
all costs. Try to address the evidence. Explain why you think the experiments showing the

16
00:01:21,680 --> 00:01:27,400
radiation absorption of CO2 are flawed. And explain how the Earth thawed from its pre-Cambrian

17
00:01:27,400 --> 00:01:32,320
snowball. And explain why the Earth was much hotter than today during the Cambrian, even

18
00:01:32,320 --> 00:01:37,160
though solar output was much lower. And explain why there's a very good correlation between

19
00:01:37,160 --> 00:01:42,480
global temperatures and CO2 levels over the last 500 million years. And explain how the

20
00:01:42,480 --> 00:01:47,680
Earth warmed enough to emerge from recent glaciations. And explain why we've had 35

21
00:01:47,680 --> 00:01:52,180
years of warming, even though solar irradiation has been lower.

22
00:01:52,180 --> 00:01:59,080
The video had over 88,000 hits at the time of writing, and 104 thumbs down. So guess

23
00:01:59,080 --> 00:02:04,320
how many of those contrarians who disagreed with the science managed to explain all these

24
00:02:04,320 --> 00:02:11,760
observations? No, not five. That's right, zero. No one could come up with an alternative

25
00:02:11,760 --> 00:02:18,040
explanation for past climate change, nor could they show why CO2 is not the cause.

26
00:02:18,040 --> 00:02:22,480
What they seem to be saying is we can't explain all these things, but we definitely don't

27
00:02:22,480 --> 00:02:27,080
want it to be carbon dioxide, so we'll go with some mysterious force of nature we can't

28
00:02:27,080 --> 00:02:35,240
explain called ABCD. Anything but carbon dioxide. To be fair, one person did promise to rebut

29
00:02:35,240 --> 00:02:41,320
the evidence with a video, but of course he never made one. Now I did ask very nicely

30
00:02:41,440 --> 00:02:46,360
for people to address the evidence presented in the video and avoid the usual internet

31
00:02:46,360 --> 00:02:53,240
rhetoric. Please don't respond with more predictable posts about how it's all an IPCC hoax, an attack

32
00:02:53,240 --> 00:02:59,240
scam and computer models are wrong. But what do you think I got in response? Yes, of course.

33
00:02:59,240 --> 00:03:04,400
Bullshit. Fraud. Gravy train. Absolute bullshit. IPCC. Politically driven.

34
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:08,880
This is a perfect example of what I said at the beginning of that video. When faced with

35
00:03:08,920 --> 00:03:14,280
evidence, the response from citizen scientists is never to look at it, or confront it, or

36
00:03:14,280 --> 00:03:20,000
challenge it, but simply to pretend it's not there. Most opted instead for the current

37
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:25,540
internet myth that carbon dioxide's changed its properties in the last 18 years and no

38
00:03:25,540 --> 00:03:30,920
longer affects global temperature the way it has for the last 500 million years. The

39
00:03:30,920 --> 00:03:35,120
argument is that even though carbon dioxide levels have been going up for the last 17

40
00:03:35,120 --> 00:03:41,240
or 18 or 15 or 20 years, wherever you want to draw your lines, temperatures have either

41
00:03:41,240 --> 00:03:47,080
not been going up as much as expected, or even been going down. Either way, global warming

42
00:03:47,080 --> 00:03:52,840
stopped. The problem has always been finding the source of this myth, because most people,

43
00:03:52,840 --> 00:03:58,240
including those who repeat it on this channel, never give their sources. So I was delighted

44
00:03:58,240 --> 00:04:03,000
when one of the most prodigious posters on my channel, Prairie Dog Res, or let's call

45
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:08,640
him PDR, was more than willing to divulge his sources, starting with the Met Office

46
00:04:08,640 --> 00:04:14,400
Report. Now funnily enough, another prodigious poster posted elsewhere on my channel at exactly

47
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:20,820
the same time. Both reappeared after a long absence. Funnier still, they both joined YouTube

48
00:04:20,820 --> 00:04:26,920
on exactly the same day. It's almost as if they're the same person. Anyway, it turned

49
00:04:26,920 --> 00:04:31,720
out that the Met Office Report did not support the Earth Has Been Cooling myth, and neither

50
00:04:31,760 --> 00:04:36,840
did all the other sources PDR tried, which is why it always pays to read these studies

51
00:04:36,840 --> 00:04:42,680
before citing them. In the end, it came down to just one set of data from Remote Sensing

52
00:04:42,680 --> 00:04:49,020
Systems, RSS. PDR justified this on the grounds that the satellite data is more accurate than

53
00:04:49,020 --> 00:04:55,200
ground station data. But of course, UAH also uses satellite data, and because of the difference

54
00:04:55,200 --> 00:05:00,840
in scale on the y-axis of these graphs, when you look at both satellite datasets, the average

55
00:05:00,840 --> 00:05:07,840
is clearly positive. So why is it one satellite dataset is better than another? PDR wouldn't

56
00:05:07,960 --> 00:05:14,640
tell me. He just said he naturally chose to go with the data that shows cooling. But in

57
00:05:14,640 --> 00:05:19,720
science, cherry picking is of course verboten, and if you do it to support an argument, you'll

58
00:05:19,720 --> 00:05:25,700
always be caught out when you finally reveal your sources. Having disposed of this cooling

59
00:05:25,700 --> 00:05:31,140
myth, what have atmospheric temperatures been doing over the last 15 years? Well, if you

60
00:05:31,140 --> 00:05:36,540
don't cherry pick, but take all the data together, they haven't been falling, but the rate of

61
00:05:36,540 --> 00:05:42,720
increase has slowed down considerably compared to the 1990s. This is what's called the pause

62
00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:49,100
or hiatus. Remember, we're talking about atmospheric temperatures, which only account for about

63
00:05:49,100 --> 00:05:54,580
10% of global warming. Most of the warming goes into the oceans. The Earth as a whole

64
00:05:54,580 --> 00:05:59,340
is still warming because researchers can measure how much energy is coming in and how

65
00:05:59,340 --> 00:06:05,060
much is going out, and the Earth is still receiving more energy than it's losing. It's

66
00:06:05,060 --> 00:06:11,380
just that the rise in atmospheric temperatures has slowed considerably over the last 15 years.

67
00:06:11,380 --> 00:06:15,780
But how is that possible if carbon dioxide levels have been rising in a more or less

68
00:06:15,780 --> 00:06:21,620
straight line? Shouldn't atmospheric temperatures do the same? Well, let's use an analogy with

69
00:06:21,620 --> 00:06:31,860
something that we can all agree causes warming, and that's the Sun. I think we can also agree

70
00:06:31,860 --> 00:06:36,700
that in the northern hemisphere, between the 1st of January and the 1st of July, the Sun

71
00:06:36,700 --> 00:06:42,200
gets gradually higher in the sky, and it shines for longer during the day. Now, suppose a

72
00:06:42,200 --> 00:06:49,260
family who've been locked in a TV studio for 20 years escapes and moves to Denver in January.

73
00:06:49,260 --> 00:06:53,660
Since they've never experienced the changing seasons, they might well form a hypothesis

74
00:06:53,660 --> 00:06:59,060
that as the Sun gets higher and the days get longer, temperatures in Denver ought to rise

75
00:06:59,060 --> 00:07:05,140
over the next six months. Let's say they call this their solar warming hypothesis. And they

76
00:07:05,140 --> 00:07:08,980
might also conclude that since the number of hours of daylight and the elevation of

77
00:07:08,980 --> 00:07:14,300
the Sun follow a simple curve, then the rise in temperature should follow the same smooth

78
00:07:14,300 --> 00:07:19,860
curve. Pretty obvious, right? But as they monitored daytime temperatures, they noticed

79
00:07:19,860 --> 00:07:25,920
something odd. The temperature did go up at first, but then it suddenly went down. So

80
00:07:25,920 --> 00:07:30,580
the fathers and the sons came to the conclusion that the Sun couldn't be the cause of warming

81
00:07:30,580 --> 00:07:35,860
after all, and I'm sure many of you would agree. And although the temperature did come

82
00:07:35,860 --> 00:07:41,620
back up, it then stayed flat for several weeks, even though the Sun continued to get higher

83
00:07:41,620 --> 00:07:47,140
in the sky and shine for longer. The mothers and the daughters, however, began to suspect

84
00:07:47,140 --> 00:07:52,760
something else was going on. They checked monthly weather reports over the last 20 years

85
00:07:52,760 --> 00:07:57,980
and noticed that on a monthly basis at least, temperatures have always risen between January

86
00:07:57,980 --> 00:08:04,460
and July. And sure enough, pretty soon temperatures started rising once again. But a few weeks

87
00:08:04,460 --> 00:08:09,560
later, the boys again challenged the solar warming hypothesis because temperatures started

88
00:08:09,560 --> 00:08:15,400
falling once more. And again, they argued that if the Sun was responsible for warming

89
00:08:15,400 --> 00:08:20,920
and the Sun was getting stronger, why were temperatures now falling? Now you may say

90
00:08:20,920 --> 00:08:26,940
duh, but it's a good question that deserves an answer. Since we know in theory that the

91
00:08:26,940 --> 00:08:31,520
increasing power of the Sun should cause temperatures to rise, and since the girls discovered that

92
00:08:31,520 --> 00:08:37,080
it's done that in the past, why doesn't the seasonal temperature rise follow growing insulation

93
00:08:37,080 --> 00:08:42,460
in a smooth curve? Why do we get all these dips and wobbles? Now I'd like to give the

94
00:08:42,460 --> 00:08:46,000
citizen scientists a few seconds to answer that one.

95
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:55,380
OK, time's up, and I'm sure most of you get this. The answer is that increasing insulation

96
00:08:55,380 --> 00:09:00,780
is the driver of temperature over the longer term, in this case measured in months. But

97
00:09:00,780 --> 00:09:05,200
in the short term, over a matter of days, there are other factors that are trying to

98
00:09:05,200 --> 00:09:11,880
drive temperatures down. Carbon dioxide is also pushing up temperatures in the long term,

99
00:09:11,880 --> 00:09:17,440
but in this case the effect is much slower, a matter of decades and centuries. Now a lot

100
00:09:17,440 --> 00:09:22,460
of people ask, if you can't predict temperatures in the short term, how can you possibly predict

101
00:09:22,460 --> 00:09:27,640
temperatures in the long term? But in fact it's much easier to predict long term trends

102
00:09:27,640 --> 00:09:33,200
than short term fluctuations, for obvious reasons. In January, a meteorologist may not

103
00:09:33,200 --> 00:09:38,540
be able to predict if February will be warmer or colder, because all kinds of unknown short

104
00:09:38,540 --> 00:09:43,960
term weather patterns will affect that prediction. But he can predict with confidence that it'll

105
00:09:43,960 --> 00:09:50,760
be warmer in May, and with even more confidence that it'll be much warmer in July.

106
00:09:50,760 --> 00:09:55,980
Because carbon dioxide works on a longer time scale, substitute one month for one decade,

107
00:09:55,980 --> 00:10:00,360
and we can see that every decade has been warmer than the previous one. The longer a

108
00:10:00,360 --> 00:10:05,520
period of time you have, whether it's months for seasonal forcing, or decades for carbon

109
00:10:05,520 --> 00:10:10,580
dioxide forcing, the easier it is to make a prediction, because the effect of all these

110
00:10:10,580 --> 00:10:16,040
short term variations gets less significant. And if that's hard to follow, let me explain

111
00:10:16,040 --> 00:10:22,000
it another way. Look at these background forcings as a kind of rising platform on which short

112
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:27,720
term influences play out. In the case of seasonal changes, these short term influences are of

113
00:10:27,720 --> 00:10:32,840
course weather patterns that last a matter of days or weeks. In the case of greenhouse

114
00:10:32,840 --> 00:10:38,280
changes, they're things like the El Nino Southern Oscillation and solar output that last in

115
00:10:38,280 --> 00:10:44,080
cycles of years or decades. Let's imagine then a typical cyclical graph that bumps up

116
00:10:44,080 --> 00:10:49,380
and down without any major changes. Sometimes it goes up, sometimes down, and sometimes

117
00:10:49,380 --> 00:10:55,220
it's flat. Now let's introduce some imaginary background effect that's rising at a steady

118
00:10:55,220 --> 00:11:03,280
rate in a straight line. Add the two together, and what do we get? Exactly what we see when

119
00:11:03,280 --> 00:11:07,820
a steady background increase in temperature is added to the ups and downs of a temperature

120
00:11:07,820 --> 00:11:13,440
graph. So the contrarians are right, we don't see a straight line rise in global temperature

121
00:11:13,440 --> 00:11:19,260
to match the straight line rise in CO2, any more than we see a straight line rise in temperature

122
00:11:19,260 --> 00:11:25,140
match seasonal insulation. But it's not enough to say we expect to see these long term trends

123
00:11:25,140 --> 00:11:30,040
fluctuate. In a subject as important and controversial as climate change, researchers

124
00:11:30,040 --> 00:11:35,320
have to show exactly what these influences are and what effect they're having. And when

125
00:11:35,320 --> 00:11:40,680
we look at these short term factors, it turns out they're all conspiring to send temperatures

126
00:11:40,680 --> 00:11:46,760
lower. For a start, solar output has been going down. Secondly, aerosol pollution has

127
00:11:46,760 --> 00:11:52,240
been on the rise, thanks to newly industrialising China and India. And following the strong

128
00:11:52,240 --> 00:11:58,280
El Niño event of 1998, there'd been a series of strong La Niña years in which the oceans

129
00:11:58,280 --> 00:12:03,320
took up a lot of the heat that was in the atmosphere. So with all these factors conspiring

130
00:12:03,320 --> 00:12:09,660
to send atmospheric temperatures lower, why haven't they gone down? Atmospheric temperatures

131
00:12:09,660 --> 00:12:16,340
not only remain stubbornly high, they've even hit a string of record highs. Something must

132
00:12:16,340 --> 00:12:22,860
be keeping atmospheric temperatures up. So what is it? Once again, the obvious conclusion,

133
00:12:22,860 --> 00:12:28,600
since it's been driving long term temperatures for at least 500 million years, is the increasing

134
00:12:28,600 --> 00:12:36,480
concentration of CO2. So my question for all those who adhere to the ideology of ABCD is,

135
00:12:36,480 --> 00:12:43,100
why not carbon dioxide? And if it's not carbon dioxide, then what is it? To scientists, there's

136
00:12:43,100 --> 00:12:48,280
no mystery about what's causing these record high temperatures. They expect more CO2 to

137
00:12:48,280 --> 00:12:53,320
warm the air, because we know from laboratory experiments that it does. And the evidence

138
00:12:53,320 --> 00:12:58,480
shows that CO2 has been the main driver of climate for the last 500 million years. And

139
00:12:58,480 --> 00:13:04,840
researchers even predicted the recent rise in global temperature as far back as the 1950s.

140
00:13:04,840 --> 00:13:09,640
And they know that the Earth is still warming, because more heat is coming in than is going

141
00:13:09,640 --> 00:13:16,020
out. What they don't understand is exactly where all this extra heat is going. Yes, of

142
00:13:16,020 --> 00:13:21,420
course, it's going into the oceans, because the oceans soak up about 90% of the increasing

143
00:13:21,420 --> 00:13:26,220
heat content of the Earth. And while there's been a pause in the steep rise of atmospheric

144
00:13:26,220 --> 00:13:32,340
temperatures, the oceans have continued to warm. The question is, exactly where in the

145
00:13:32,340 --> 00:13:37,620
oceans is this extra heat going? How's it circulating? And the other question that's

146
00:13:37,620 --> 00:13:42,580
currently a hot topic in climate science is how much influence aerosol pollution from

147
00:13:42,580 --> 00:13:49,140
China and India is having in mitigating the warming effects of CO2. One recent paper suggested

148
00:13:49,140 --> 00:13:54,800
their influence may be amplified because aerosols are being spread more in the northern hemisphere,

149
00:13:54,800 --> 00:14:00,520
which is where CO2 is concentrated. Since the armchair scientists don't want carbon

150
00:14:00,520 --> 00:14:05,620
dioxide to be the cause for ideological reasons, then why don't you guys have another crack

151
00:14:05,620 --> 00:14:10,360
at explaining all the phenomena outlined in my previous video without invoking the

152
00:14:10,360 --> 00:14:16,780
dreaded CO2? And have a go at answering the questions in this video too. And before you

153
00:14:16,780 --> 00:14:22,660
say galactic rays, or cosmic rays, or God, or the Sun, please take a look at the notes

154
00:14:22,660 --> 00:14:25,180
at the end of this video and try again.
