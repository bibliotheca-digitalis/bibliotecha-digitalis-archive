1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
Experts admit global warming prediction's wrong!

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:05,000
What? No, there's more to it than that.

3
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:08,000
Fear of global warming is exaggerated, say scientists.

4
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:10,000
Excuse me, they didn't say that at all.

5
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:14,000
Climate alarmists finally admit we were wrong about global warming.

6
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:17,000
Oh look, can you all calm down? That's enough.

7
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:20,000
Report shows that the world isn't as warm as the green doom mongers warned.

8
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:21,000
Shush!

9
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:22,000
How scientists got their global warming...

10
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:24,000
Shut up!

11
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:27,000
Stop copying and pasting off each other for one minute

12
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:31,000
and read the actual study you think you're all commenting on.

13
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:36,000
Even the authors of the study were so appalled at this misrepresentation of their work

14
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:40,000
that they issued a public rebuke to these incompetent commentators.

15
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:42,000
We'll take a look at that in a minute.

16
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:47,000
The study was published last week in Nature Geoscience by Miller et al.

17
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:49,000
and looks at the cumulative carbon budget,

18
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:53,000
specifically how much carbon needs to accumulate in the atmosphere

19
00:00:53,000 --> 00:01:00,000
before average global temperature rises by 1.5°C from 1870 levels.

20
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:04,000
What they found was that the accumulated carbon needed to reach this level

21
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:08,000
is probably much higher than had been previously estimated.

22
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:11,000
At the current rate of carbon accumulation,

23
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:15,000
the study says we'll probably reach that level in about 20 years' time.

24
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:19,000
That kicks the can down the road about another 13 years,

25
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:24,000
giving us, as the authors describe it, a bit more breathing space.

26
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:30,000
The study's other conclusion is that if we begin implementing the Paris Climate Accord right now

27
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:35,000
and every country aggressively follows the step-down approach of carbon reduction agreed to,

28
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:39,000
then that timeframe will be pushed much further down the road.

29
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:43,000
It's not impossible, they say, to keep reducing carbon emissions

30
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:47,000
and push that cumulative total even further into the future

31
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:50,000
until CO2 emissions are effectively reduced to zero

32
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:55,000
and the temperature rises stabilised at 1.5°C.

33
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:59,000
So what the study says is very different to the claims of the headlines

34
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:03,000
and the commentators who didn't bother with any of this detail.

35
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:08,000
All they chose to read was that we won't hit 1.5°C for another 20 years

36
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:11,000
and that it will stay at 1.5°C,

37
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:16,000
which they figured is nothing like the high rates of warming that had been forecast.

38
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:20,000
Ironically, these commentators missed the point that this will only happen

39
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:25,000
if we drastically reduce carbon emissions, something they've always opposed.

40
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:31,000
James Delingpole, who's largely responsible for setting off this copy-and-paste stampede,

41
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:39,000
claimed the IPCC's doomsday prediction of 1.5°C by the year 2022 was well and truly busted.

42
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:43,000
The problem is, as two of the study's authors later pointed out,

43
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:47,000
the IPCC never made any such prediction.

44
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:53,000
In fact, they wrote, the IPCC specifically assessed that temperatures in the 2020s

45
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:57,000
would be 0.9°C to 1.3°C warmer than pre-industrial,

46
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:01,000
the lower end of which is already looking conservative.

47
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:07,000
Anyone who had trouble to read our paper would have found this IPCC AR5 Chapter 11 projection

48
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:13,000
helpfully labelled on two of our figures and clearly consistent with our new results.

49
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:17,000
And yes, here it is, highlighted in orange.

50
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:22,000
It's funny, when I was alerted to this study, I took a quick look at the abstract

51
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:25,000
and it was pretty clear what the paper was trying to say.

52
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:28,000
I posted a response on my channel saying,

53
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:33,000
my bet is that the so-called sceptics are now going to hold up this paper and say,

54
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:39,000
And I was dead right, Delingpole decided the paper was vindication.

55
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:43,000
In Breitbart News, he wrote that Michael Grubb, one of the authors,

56
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:46,000
is claiming that the facts have changed, which they haven't.

57
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:52,000
Climate sceptics have been saying for years that the IPCC climate models have been running too hot.

58
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:56,000
But Delingpole's completely misrepresenting Grubb's statement

59
00:03:56,000 --> 00:04:01,000
by making it sound as though he's saying that the facts about the climate models have changed.

60
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:05,000
If we go to Delingpole's source, the Times newspaper,

61
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:10,000
it asserts that Grubb admitted that his previous prediction had been wrong.

62
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:14,000
He stated during the climate summit in Paris in December 2015,

63
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:28,000
But Grubb wasn't talking about his previous prediction on climate,

64
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:33,000
he was talking about his view back in 2015 that people wouldn't be prepared

65
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:37,000
to take the necessary steps to reduce their carbon emissions

66
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:40,000
and get their energy from renewable sources.

67
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:45,000
How do I know that's what he meant? Because I tracked down the original quote.

68
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:50,000
Here it is in its entirety and in context in the Daily Telegraph,

69
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:55,000
Delingpole's host newspaper, dated December 12th 2015.

70
00:04:55,000 --> 00:05:00,000
Professor Michael Grubb of University College London said achieving 1.5°C

71
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:05,000
would require higher energy prices and more onshore wind farms.

72
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:09,000
However much people profess to care about climate change,

73
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:15,000
they do not seem willing to vote for this, nor do politicians seem willing to really try and persuade them, he said.

74
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:22,000
All the evidence from the past 15 years leads me to conclude that actually delivering 1.5°C

75
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:25,000
is simply incompatible with democracy.

76
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:29,000
So Delingpole has lifted a quote where Grubb was talking about his error

77
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:32,000
in thinking people wouldn't switch to renewable energy,

78
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:37,000
and made it seem as though he was talking about an error in his climate model.

79
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:40,000
Then Delingpole doubled down in the Sun newspaper.

80
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:58,000
Now that we know Delingpole misrepresented the quote from Grubb,

81
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:03,000
and that the IPCC didn't make the doomsday prediction that Delingpole reported,

82
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:10,000
the only mistake is the discrepancy between Miller's models and the IPCC models that I described,

83
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:15,000
the level at which cumulated carbon needs to reach 1.5°C.

84
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:18,000
So how big and significant is this mistake?

85
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:24,000
The best way to describe it would be to say that it's quite big on a small scale, but quite small on a big scale.

86
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:29,000
The authors of the study say the discrepancy is relatively modest.

87
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:33,000
For a global temperature rise of 3°C or 4°C,

88
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:39,000
this discrepancy would be relatively insignificant for the remaining carbon budget.

89
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:46,000
Where the discrepancy is significant is for the cumulative carbon needed to reach a temperature of 1°C.

90
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:53,000
And they say that's because we only need a further increase in temperature of about 0.6°C to reach that figure.

91
00:06:53,000 --> 00:07:02,000
The researchers say it's such a small amount that even a minor temperature discrepancy between the two models would shift that date considerably.

92
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:10,000
Study authors Richard Miller and Miles Allen said they'd even explained why there was a discrepancy at a press briefing.

93
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:17,000
We took pains at the briefing to stress the discrepancy was likely due to other, more transient factors.

94
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:20,000
Those who were there evidently understood.

95
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:25,000
But it seems Delingpole either wasn't there, or he didn't understand.

96
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:29,000
If you're still inclined to believe the armchair commentators and the cries of

97
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:32,000
FEAR OF GLOBAL WARMING IS EXAGGERATED, SAY SCIENTISTS

98
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:36,000
or if you fancy yourself as an armchair commentator in the comments forum here,

99
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:47,000
for goodness sake, read what the study's authors themselves wrote about how their study was being misreported.

100
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:54,000
After reasonably accurate initial reporting, suddenly our paper was about a downgrading of the threat of climate change,

101
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:57,000
when it was actually nothing of the kind.

102
00:07:57,000 --> 00:08:03,000
Our predictions for warming rates over the coming decades are identical to those of the IPCC,

103
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:08,000
and we do not assess the impacts of climate change for any warming level.

104
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:14,000
I don't think I can sign off with anything more erudite than this last word from the authors of the paper,

105
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:22,000
who singled out Delingpole and left-wing member of parliament Graham Stringer as the most egregious of the junk science pundits.

106
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:28,000
Debating the current level of human-induced warming and how it relates to the 1.5°C goal

107
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:33,000
feels a bit like discussing how best to steer a spacecraft into orbit around Saturn,

108
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:40,000
while Delingpole and Stringer are urging their readers to question whether the Earth goes round the Sun.
