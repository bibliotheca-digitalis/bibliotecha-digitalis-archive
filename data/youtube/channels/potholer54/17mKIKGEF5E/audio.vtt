00:00.000 --> 00:03.000
Experts admit global warming prediction's wrong!

00:03.000 --> 00:05.000
What? No, there's more to it than that.

00:05.000 --> 00:08.000
Fear of global warming is exaggerated, say scientists.

00:08.000 --> 00:10.000
Excuse me, they didn't say that at all.

00:10.000 --> 00:14.000
Climate alarmists finally admit we were wrong about global warming.

00:14.000 --> 00:17.000
Oh look, can you all calm down? That's enough.

00:17.000 --> 00:20.000
Report shows that the world isn't as warm as the green doom mongers warned.

00:20.000 --> 00:21.000
Shush!

00:21.000 --> 00:22.000
How scientists got their global warming...

00:22.000 --> 00:24.000
Shut up!

00:24.000 --> 00:27.000
Stop copying and pasting off each other for one minute

00:27.000 --> 00:31.000
and read the actual study you think you're all commenting on.

00:31.000 --> 00:36.000
Even the authors of the study were so appalled at this misrepresentation of their work

00:36.000 --> 00:40.000
that they issued a public rebuke to these incompetent commentators.

00:40.000 --> 00:42.000
We'll take a look at that in a minute.

00:42.000 --> 00:47.000
The study was published last week in Nature Geoscience by Miller et al.

00:47.000 --> 00:49.000
and looks at the cumulative carbon budget,

00:49.000 --> 00:53.000
specifically how much carbon needs to accumulate in the atmosphere

00:53.000 --> 01:00.000
before average global temperature rises by 1.5°C from 1870 levels.

01:00.000 --> 01:04.000
What they found was that the accumulated carbon needed to reach this level

01:04.000 --> 01:08.000
is probably much higher than had been previously estimated.

01:08.000 --> 01:11.000
At the current rate of carbon accumulation,

01:11.000 --> 01:15.000
the study says we'll probably reach that level in about 20 years' time.

01:15.000 --> 01:19.000
That kicks the can down the road about another 13 years,

01:19.000 --> 01:24.000
giving us, as the authors describe it, a bit more breathing space.

01:24.000 --> 01:30.000
The study's other conclusion is that if we begin implementing the Paris Climate Accord right now

01:30.000 --> 01:35.000
and every country aggressively follows the step-down approach of carbon reduction agreed to,

01:35.000 --> 01:39.000
then that timeframe will be pushed much further down the road.

01:39.000 --> 01:43.000
It's not impossible, they say, to keep reducing carbon emissions

01:43.000 --> 01:47.000
and push that cumulative total even further into the future

01:47.000 --> 01:50.000
until CO2 emissions are effectively reduced to zero

01:50.000 --> 01:55.000
and the temperature rises stabilised at 1.5°C.

01:55.000 --> 01:59.000
So what the study says is very different to the claims of the headlines

01:59.000 --> 02:03.000
and the commentators who didn't bother with any of this detail.

02:03.000 --> 02:08.000
All they chose to read was that we won't hit 1.5°C for another 20 years

02:08.000 --> 02:11.000
and that it will stay at 1.5°C,

02:11.000 --> 02:16.000
which they figured is nothing like the high rates of warming that had been forecast.

02:16.000 --> 02:20.000
Ironically, these commentators missed the point that this will only happen

02:20.000 --> 02:25.000
if we drastically reduce carbon emissions, something they've always opposed.

02:25.000 --> 02:31.000
James Delingpole, who's largely responsible for setting off this copy-and-paste stampede,

02:31.000 --> 02:39.000
claimed the IPCC's doomsday prediction of 1.5°C by the year 2022 was well and truly busted.

02:39.000 --> 02:43.000
The problem is, as two of the study's authors later pointed out,

02:43.000 --> 02:47.000
the IPCC never made any such prediction.

02:47.000 --> 02:53.000
In fact, they wrote, the IPCC specifically assessed that temperatures in the 2020s

02:53.000 --> 02:57.000
would be 0.9°C to 1.3°C warmer than pre-industrial,

02:57.000 --> 03:01.000
the lower end of which is already looking conservative.

03:01.000 --> 03:07.000
Anyone who had trouble to read our paper would have found this IPCC AR5 Chapter 11 projection

03:07.000 --> 03:13.000
helpfully labelled on two of our figures and clearly consistent with our new results.

03:13.000 --> 03:17.000
And yes, here it is, highlighted in orange.

03:17.000 --> 03:22.000
It's funny, when I was alerted to this study, I took a quick look at the abstract

03:22.000 --> 03:25.000
and it was pretty clear what the paper was trying to say.

03:25.000 --> 03:28.000
I posted a response on my channel saying,

03:28.000 --> 03:33.000
my bet is that the so-called sceptics are now going to hold up this paper and say,

03:34.000 --> 03:39.000
And I was dead right, Delingpole decided the paper was vindication.

03:39.000 --> 03:43.000
In Breitbart News, he wrote that Michael Grubb, one of the authors,

03:43.000 --> 03:46.000
is claiming that the facts have changed, which they haven't.

03:46.000 --> 03:52.000
Climate sceptics have been saying for years that the IPCC climate models have been running too hot.

03:52.000 --> 03:56.000
But Delingpole's completely misrepresenting Grubb's statement

03:56.000 --> 04:01.000
by making it sound as though he's saying that the facts about the climate models have changed.

04:01.000 --> 04:05.000
If we go to Delingpole's source, the Times newspaper,

04:05.000 --> 04:10.000
it asserts that Grubb admitted that his previous prediction had been wrong.

04:10.000 --> 04:14.000
He stated during the climate summit in Paris in December 2015,

04:24.000 --> 04:28.000
But Grubb wasn't talking about his previous prediction on climate,

04:28.000 --> 04:33.000
he was talking about his view back in 2015 that people wouldn't be prepared

04:33.000 --> 04:37.000
to take the necessary steps to reduce their carbon emissions

04:37.000 --> 04:40.000
and get their energy from renewable sources.

04:40.000 --> 04:45.000
How do I know that's what he meant? Because I tracked down the original quote.

04:45.000 --> 04:50.000
Here it is in its entirety and in context in the Daily Telegraph,

04:50.000 --> 04:55.000
Delingpole's host newspaper, dated December 12th 2015.

04:55.000 --> 05:00.000
Professor Michael Grubb of University College London said achieving 1.5°C

05:00.000 --> 05:05.000
would require higher energy prices and more onshore wind farms.

05:05.000 --> 05:09.000
However much people profess to care about climate change,

05:09.000 --> 05:15.000
they do not seem willing to vote for this, nor do politicians seem willing to really try and persuade them, he said.

05:15.000 --> 05:22.000
All the evidence from the past 15 years leads me to conclude that actually delivering 1.5°C

05:22.000 --> 05:25.000
is simply incompatible with democracy.

05:25.000 --> 05:29.000
So Delingpole has lifted a quote where Grubb was talking about his error

05:29.000 --> 05:32.000
in thinking people wouldn't switch to renewable energy,

05:32.000 --> 05:37.000
and made it seem as though he was talking about an error in his climate model.

05:37.000 --> 05:40.000
Then Delingpole doubled down in the Sun newspaper.

05:53.000 --> 05:58.000
Now that we know Delingpole misrepresented the quote from Grubb,

05:58.000 --> 06:03.000
and that the IPCC didn't make the doomsday prediction that Delingpole reported,

06:03.000 --> 06:10.000
the only mistake is the discrepancy between Miller's models and the IPCC models that I described,

06:10.000 --> 06:15.000
the level at which cumulated carbon needs to reach 1.5°C.

06:15.000 --> 06:18.000
So how big and significant is this mistake?

06:18.000 --> 06:24.000
The best way to describe it would be to say that it's quite big on a small scale, but quite small on a big scale.

06:24.000 --> 06:29.000
The authors of the study say the discrepancy is relatively modest.

06:29.000 --> 06:33.000
For a global temperature rise of 3°C or 4°C,

06:33.000 --> 06:39.000
this discrepancy would be relatively insignificant for the remaining carbon budget.

06:39.000 --> 06:46.000
Where the discrepancy is significant is for the cumulative carbon needed to reach a temperature of 1°C.

06:46.000 --> 06:53.000
And they say that's because we only need a further increase in temperature of about 0.6°C to reach that figure.

06:53.000 --> 07:02.000
The researchers say it's such a small amount that even a minor temperature discrepancy between the two models would shift that date considerably.

07:02.000 --> 07:10.000
Study authors Richard Miller and Miles Allen said they'd even explained why there was a discrepancy at a press briefing.

07:10.000 --> 07:17.000
We took pains at the briefing to stress the discrepancy was likely due to other, more transient factors.

07:17.000 --> 07:20.000
Those who were there evidently understood.

07:20.000 --> 07:25.000
But it seems Delingpole either wasn't there, or he didn't understand.

07:25.000 --> 07:29.000
If you're still inclined to believe the armchair commentators and the cries of

07:29.000 --> 07:32.000
FEAR OF GLOBAL WARMING IS EXAGGERATED, SAY SCIENTISTS

07:32.000 --> 07:36.000
or if you fancy yourself as an armchair commentator in the comments forum here,

07:36.000 --> 07:47.000
for goodness sake, read what the study's authors themselves wrote about how their study was being misreported.

07:47.000 --> 07:54.000
After reasonably accurate initial reporting, suddenly our paper was about a downgrading of the threat of climate change,

07:54.000 --> 07:57.000
when it was actually nothing of the kind.

07:57.000 --> 08:03.000
Our predictions for warming rates over the coming decades are identical to those of the IPCC,

08:03.000 --> 08:08.000
and we do not assess the impacts of climate change for any warming level.

08:08.000 --> 08:14.000
I don't think I can sign off with anything more erudite than this last word from the authors of the paper,

08:14.000 --> 08:22.000
who singled out Delingpole and left-wing member of parliament Graham Stringer as the most egregious of the junk science pundits.

08:22.000 --> 08:28.000
Debating the current level of human-induced warming and how it relates to the 1.5°C goal

08:28.000 --> 08:33.000
feels a bit like discussing how best to steer a spacecraft into orbit around Saturn,

08:33.000 --> 08:40.000
while Delingpole and Stringer are urging their readers to question whether the Earth goes round the Sun.
