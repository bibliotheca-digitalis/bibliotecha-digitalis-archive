0	3000	Experts admit global warming prediction's wrong!
3000	5000	What? No, there's more to it than that.
5000	8000	Fear of global warming is exaggerated, say scientists.
8000	10000	Excuse me, they didn't say that at all.
10000	14000	Climate alarmists finally admit we were wrong about global warming.
14000	17000	Oh look, can you all calm down? That's enough.
17000	20000	Report shows that the world isn't as warm as the green doom mongers warned.
20000	21000	Shush!
21000	22000	How scientists got their global warming...
22000	24000	Shut up!
24000	27000	Stop copying and pasting off each other for one minute
27000	31000	and read the actual study you think you're all commenting on.
31000	36000	Even the authors of the study were so appalled at this misrepresentation of their work
36000	40000	that they issued a public rebuke to these incompetent commentators.
40000	42000	We'll take a look at that in a minute.
42000	47000	The study was published last week in Nature Geoscience by Miller et al.
47000	49000	and looks at the cumulative carbon budget,
49000	53000	specifically how much carbon needs to accumulate in the atmosphere
53000	60000	before average global temperature rises by 1.5°C from 1870 levels.
60000	64000	What they found was that the accumulated carbon needed to reach this level
64000	68000	is probably much higher than had been previously estimated.
68000	71000	At the current rate of carbon accumulation,
71000	75000	the study says we'll probably reach that level in about 20 years' time.
75000	79000	That kicks the can down the road about another 13 years,
79000	84000	giving us, as the authors describe it, a bit more breathing space.
84000	90000	The study's other conclusion is that if we begin implementing the Paris Climate Accord right now
90000	95000	and every country aggressively follows the step-down approach of carbon reduction agreed to,
95000	99000	then that timeframe will be pushed much further down the road.
99000	103000	It's not impossible, they say, to keep reducing carbon emissions
103000	107000	and push that cumulative total even further into the future
107000	110000	until CO2 emissions are effectively reduced to zero
110000	115000	and the temperature rises stabilised at 1.5°C.
115000	119000	So what the study says is very different to the claims of the headlines
119000	123000	and the commentators who didn't bother with any of this detail.
123000	128000	All they chose to read was that we won't hit 1.5°C for another 20 years
128000	131000	and that it will stay at 1.5°C,
131000	136000	which they figured is nothing like the high rates of warming that had been forecast.
136000	140000	Ironically, these commentators missed the point that this will only happen
140000	145000	if we drastically reduce carbon emissions, something they've always opposed.
145000	151000	James Delingpole, who's largely responsible for setting off this copy-and-paste stampede,
151000	159000	claimed the IPCC's doomsday prediction of 1.5°C by the year 2022 was well and truly busted.
159000	163000	The problem is, as two of the study's authors later pointed out,
163000	167000	the IPCC never made any such prediction.
167000	173000	In fact, they wrote, the IPCC specifically assessed that temperatures in the 2020s
173000	177000	would be 0.9°C to 1.3°C warmer than pre-industrial,
177000	181000	the lower end of which is already looking conservative.
181000	187000	Anyone who had trouble to read our paper would have found this IPCC AR5 Chapter 11 projection
187000	193000	helpfully labelled on two of our figures and clearly consistent with our new results.
193000	197000	And yes, here it is, highlighted in orange.
197000	202000	It's funny, when I was alerted to this study, I took a quick look at the abstract
202000	205000	and it was pretty clear what the paper was trying to say.
205000	208000	I posted a response on my channel saying,
208000	213000	my bet is that the so-called sceptics are now going to hold up this paper and say,
214000	219000	And I was dead right, Delingpole decided the paper was vindication.
219000	223000	In Breitbart News, he wrote that Michael Grubb, one of the authors,
223000	226000	is claiming that the facts have changed, which they haven't.
226000	232000	Climate sceptics have been saying for years that the IPCC climate models have been running too hot.
232000	236000	But Delingpole's completely misrepresenting Grubb's statement
236000	241000	by making it sound as though he's saying that the facts about the climate models have changed.
241000	245000	If we go to Delingpole's source, the Times newspaper,
245000	250000	it asserts that Grubb admitted that his previous prediction had been wrong.
250000	254000	He stated during the climate summit in Paris in December 2015,
264000	268000	But Grubb wasn't talking about his previous prediction on climate,
268000	273000	he was talking about his view back in 2015 that people wouldn't be prepared
273000	277000	to take the necessary steps to reduce their carbon emissions
277000	280000	and get their energy from renewable sources.
280000	285000	How do I know that's what he meant? Because I tracked down the original quote.
285000	290000	Here it is in its entirety and in context in the Daily Telegraph,
290000	295000	Delingpole's host newspaper, dated December 12th 2015.
295000	300000	Professor Michael Grubb of University College London said achieving 1.5°C
300000	305000	would require higher energy prices and more onshore wind farms.
305000	309000	However much people profess to care about climate change,
309000	315000	they do not seem willing to vote for this, nor do politicians seem willing to really try and persuade them, he said.
315000	322000	All the evidence from the past 15 years leads me to conclude that actually delivering 1.5°C
322000	325000	is simply incompatible with democracy.
325000	329000	So Delingpole has lifted a quote where Grubb was talking about his error
329000	332000	in thinking people wouldn't switch to renewable energy,
332000	337000	and made it seem as though he was talking about an error in his climate model.
337000	340000	Then Delingpole doubled down in the Sun newspaper.
353000	358000	Now that we know Delingpole misrepresented the quote from Grubb,
358000	363000	and that the IPCC didn't make the doomsday prediction that Delingpole reported,
363000	370000	the only mistake is the discrepancy between Miller's models and the IPCC models that I described,
370000	375000	the level at which cumulated carbon needs to reach 1.5°C.
375000	378000	So how big and significant is this mistake?
378000	384000	The best way to describe it would be to say that it's quite big on a small scale, but quite small on a big scale.
384000	389000	The authors of the study say the discrepancy is relatively modest.
389000	393000	For a global temperature rise of 3°C or 4°C,
393000	399000	this discrepancy would be relatively insignificant for the remaining carbon budget.
399000	406000	Where the discrepancy is significant is for the cumulative carbon needed to reach a temperature of 1°C.
406000	413000	And they say that's because we only need a further increase in temperature of about 0.6°C to reach that figure.
413000	422000	The researchers say it's such a small amount that even a minor temperature discrepancy between the two models would shift that date considerably.
422000	430000	Study authors Richard Miller and Miles Allen said they'd even explained why there was a discrepancy at a press briefing.
430000	437000	We took pains at the briefing to stress the discrepancy was likely due to other, more transient factors.
437000	440000	Those who were there evidently understood.
440000	445000	But it seems Delingpole either wasn't there, or he didn't understand.
445000	449000	If you're still inclined to believe the armchair commentators and the cries of
449000	452000	FEAR OF GLOBAL WARMING IS EXAGGERATED, SAY SCIENTISTS
452000	456000	or if you fancy yourself as an armchair commentator in the comments forum here,
456000	467000	for goodness sake, read what the study's authors themselves wrote about how their study was being misreported.
467000	474000	After reasonably accurate initial reporting, suddenly our paper was about a downgrading of the threat of climate change,
474000	477000	when it was actually nothing of the kind.
477000	483000	Our predictions for warming rates over the coming decades are identical to those of the IPCC,
483000	488000	and we do not assess the impacts of climate change for any warming level.
488000	494000	I don't think I can sign off with anything more erudite than this last word from the authors of the paper,
494000	502000	who singled out Delingpole and left-wing member of parliament Graham Stringer as the most egregious of the junk science pundits.
502000	508000	Debating the current level of human-induced warming and how it relates to the 1.5°C goal
508000	513000	feels a bit like discussing how best to steer a spacecraft into orbit around Saturn,
513000	520000	while Delingpole and Stringer are urging their readers to question whether the Earth goes round the Sun.
