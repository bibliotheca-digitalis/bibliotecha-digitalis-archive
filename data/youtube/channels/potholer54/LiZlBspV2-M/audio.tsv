0	5220	I don't know why so many people wrote in and asked me to respond to this latest exchange
5220	8340	between Christopher Monckton and Stefan Molyneux.
8340	13020	Molyneux seems quite capable of challenging Monckton's claims himself, because Molyneux
13020	15620	believes in looking at both sides of the issue.
15620	19900	I mean, there's nothing more boring than somebody who's only ever looked at evidence which supports
19900	21380	his or her own conclusions.
21380	26020	Look at the country evidence, and that will breed, I think, a very important and virtuous
26020	27020	humility.
27040	30980	Molyneux listens to Monckton, who represents the side that thinks it's all a conspiracy.
30980	35040	They are about to impose a communist world government on the world.
35040	40140	I'm sure he also listens to research scientists, who explain the evidence that carbon dioxide
40140	45820	has been the primary driver of global temperature for the last 500 million years, and the evidence
45820	50660	that a doubling of carbon dioxide from pre-industrial levels will lead to a temperature rise of
50660	54440	between 2 and 4.5 degrees centigrade.
54440	59020	So let's start with the side that thinks the whole thing's a conspiracy of greedy scientists,
59020	63560	who are perpetrating this hoax to impose a communist world government, or to get rich,
63560	68040	or whatever else that motivates them to write supposedly fraudulent papers.
68040	69800	Right, it's very simple.
69800	76200	The first serious predictions made based on what are called an ensemble of several models
76200	81720	taken together were done by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change.
81720	88280	The rate of global warming is not much more than half of what they originally predicted.
88280	93120	Well, to use the scientific form of rebuttal, that's complete bollocks.
93120	97920	The 1990 prediction was the first by the IPCC, and quite crude.
97920	101480	It only looked at warming caused by greenhouse gases.
101480	106520	So short-term and unpredictable variables, like fluctuating solar output and aerosol
106520	109040	pollution, weren't considered.
109040	114340	So if we look at what the IPCC was actually predicting, the temperature trend due to greenhouse
114340	118760	gases, which is the light blue line in this graph, is bang on target.
118760	123600	I bet someone is already typing out a post to say, what good are predictions if they
123600	125760	can't take short-term variables into account?
125760	131560	Well, the answer is that short-term variables are, by definition, short-term.
131560	132900	And they're variable.
132900	136180	They go up and down over a period of a few years.
136180	140820	So they may reduce warming in one part of the projection and increase warming in another
140820	141820	part.
141820	147360	But overall, they make no difference to the long-term trend due to CO2.
147360	152140	Even if you want to pretend the IPCC graph was taking these variables into account, the
152140	157820	actual temperature trend is still within the IPCC estimates.
157820	161620	Researchers say that's because the warming effect of carbon dioxide is so strong that
161620	166640	it's overcome all these short-term cooling factors over the last few years and continued
166640	169720	to send temperatures to new record highs.
169720	175480	The only way Moncton can claim it hasn't is to cherry-pick his temperature data set.
175480	177000	He wouldn't do that, would he?
177000	186160	In fact, between approximately 1997 and 2014, 2015, there was a period of 18 years and nine
186160	189960	months according to one of the data sets with no global warming at all.
189960	193880	As according to one of the data sets is the key point.
193880	195500	And which one is that?
195500	199220	I'm sure Molyneux is going to ask him, but let's take a look at the data set Moncton's
199220	200780	cherry-picked in the past.
200780	203140	There is the actual record from the scientists.
203140	205500	There is the trend line calculated on it.
205500	206620	It is horizontal.
206620	209420	No warming has happened for 17 years, nine months.
209420	214020	It's the temperature data set from Remote Sensing Systems, RSS.
214020	218900	The RSS data set has been the odd one out for over a decade now because all the other
218900	224280	data sets show clear atmospheric warming over that 18-year period.
224280	228720	Every scientific institute that monitors global temperature agrees that there's been roughly
228720	232400	the same amount of atmospheric warming over that period.
232400	234840	All except RSS.
234840	238920	And that's the data set Moncton chose to cite.
238920	243360	Now clearly there's something wrong when everyone's measuring average global temperature
243360	246800	and only one measurement is way out of line.
246800	251580	And Roy Spencer agreed there had to be something wrong with the RSS data.
251580	252580	And there was.
252580	257820	RSS discovered that its data were erroneous because of a miscalculation of diurnal cycle
257820	263440	drift and admitted this error in a paper published in March 2016.
263440	267000	But for some reason, Moncton didn't mention this.
267000	271420	So why doesn't Molyneux ask Moncton which data set he's quoting?
271420	275200	And if it's RSS, why didn't he mention the correction?
275200	281020	Moncton asked Moncton why he ignored all the other data sets which all show warming.
281020	285100	Don't worry, as soon as Moncton pauses for breath, I'm sure Molyneux will jump in and
285100	287100	question his claims.
287100	292100	But not yet, because Moncton's already moved on to where he published all this evidence.
292100	298340	I published a paper in the journal of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, the Science Bulletin,
298340	303500	in January of last year in which I pointed out that there were various dubieties, various
303500	306960	uncertainties, various errors in the models that had not...
306960	309160	Well, let's not get carried away.
309160	314140	The journal Moncton's talking about, the Science Bulletin, previously called the Chinese Science
314140	318320	Bulletin, does have a reasonably respected print version.
318320	323920	It's one of many journals that describe themselves as supervised, sponsored or co-sponsored by
323920	326460	the Chinese Academy of Sciences.
326460	331240	But Moncton's paper wasn't published in the print version, it was in the separate online
331240	335940	open access version, and if you want to get a paper published there, you have to stump
335940	338860	up $2,500.
338860	343660	Pay-to-play online journals like this are not highly respected and are often poorly
343660	344660	peer reviewed.
344660	349660	It's a bit like a Vogon paying to have his poetry published in a vanity book of poems
349660	353860	and then claiming it's been published by the Royal Society of Literature.
353860	359060	One climatologist at the University of Reading found what he called glaring fundamental errors
359060	360980	in Moncton's paper.
360980	365680	It shouldn't surprise fans of my Moncton Buncombe video series, which showed that Moncton has
365680	368080	a history of getting his sums wrong.
368080	369640	Here's my own calculation.
369640	376000	And we get 1.6 degrees Celsius as the change in temperature for a doubling of CO2.
376000	381480	The warming we would expect to get if we doubled the CO2 concentration in the atmosphere, that
381480	387240	is what's known as climate sensitivity, will be about a fifth of a Celsius degree.
387240	389460	Just a little bit more than a fifth of a Celsius degree.
389460	394180	In his piece in the Forum on Physics and Society newsletter, Moncton gives yet another figure
394180	397640	for temperature rise, 0.58 degrees centigrade.
397640	402360	Apart from the howling error of calling Kelvin degrees Kelvin, which would have earned a
402360	406980	rebuke from any high school physics teacher, Moncton made a bigger mix-up in that last
406980	412560	calculation when he claimed to have divided sensitivity by three, but in fact he erroneously
412560	415240	divided forcing by three.
415260	421620	Facing up forcing and sensitivity is the climatological equivalent of confusing time and distance.
421620	426180	And now Moncton's come up with yet another calculation for the Earth's equilibrium temperature.
426180	433940	I can now prove that the variance either side of the central estimate of global warming
433940	439380	as a result of feedback is now only going to be kind of less than half a Celsius degree.
439380	441700	Well, let's not hold our breath.
441700	445720	Despite having come up with a variety of different calculations over the years, whose
445720	451360	results vary by a factor of eight, not one of Moncton's projections has even come close
451360	454180	to matching actual temperature trends.
454180	459120	He even predicted that global temperatures would follow solar activity downwards when
459120	463220	in fact they followed carbon dioxide levels upwards.
463220	468000	So just ten minutes in and surely there's more than enough for Molyneux to challenge
468000	471080	or at least ask for some clarification.
471080	476800	And he will question Moncton's claims, because fortunately for us, Molyneux is a sceptic.
476800	485280	It is strange to me that a scepticism about highly conjectural source data should be considered
485280	489560	anti-scientific when it seems to me that the scientific method is entirely predicated on
489560	495060	the rigorous application of scepticism, particularly to projected or modelled data.
495060	496060	Exactly right.
496060	500940	And here we have projected and modelled data based on a cherry-picked and erroneous data
500940	507100	set from a man with no scientific training and a history of making calculation blunders.
507100	508980	So go for it, Stefan.
508980	509980	Apply that scepticism.
509980	516780	Well, this is, I think, a lot of things that are not understood by people who are pro-global
516780	520380	warming or who have trouble with the sceptics.
520380	524620	Oh dear, I'm a little disappointed in you, Stefan.
524620	525620	Whatever happened to…
525620	529500	…the rigorous application of scepticism, particularly to projected or modelled data.
529500	534540	Well, maybe Molyneux is just giving Moncton free rein, because he also has real climatologists
534540	537940	on his show who present the evidence supporting the science.
537940	539180	Let's see.
539180	543980	He will be speaking at the Global Warming and Inconvenient Lie Conference in Phoenix,
543980	544980	Arizona.
544980	547500	And he is the author of The Moral Case for Fossil Fuels.
547500	549660	He's an expert on energy and industrial policy.
549660	553620	I mean, there's nothing more boring than somebody who's only ever looked at evidence
553620	555820	which supports his or her own conclusions.
555820	556820	What is the problem?
556820	557820	What is the concern?
557820	561540	You pimp your website for a second to make sure that people can go and get to the source
561540	562540	data.
562540	563540	It's climate-sceptic.com.
563540	564540	Is that right?
564540	569540	There is no guarantee that it's going to get warmer just because there's more CO2.
569540	570980	Eh, no.
570980	576100	It turns out that every one of his guests simply echoes the belief that it's all a
576100	577100	conspiracy.
577100	580220	So what does Molyneux believe when it comes to actual science?
580420	584460	There's no question that CO2 is produced by human beings.
584460	589300	There's no question that it has increased over the past, say, 50 or 70 years.
589300	593260	And there's no doubt that it has a warming factor in the atmosphere.
593260	597300	As far as that goes, I mean, anybody who would deny that is having trouble tying their shoelaces
597300	599020	and getting out of the door in the morning.
599020	603940	He just doesn't accept the conclusion of researchers in fields as far apart as volcanology,
603940	609580	glaciology, paleoclimatology, atmospheric physics, who've all done studies independent
609620	614500	of each other, some using models, some looking at temperature responses to past changes in
614500	619580	CO2, whose results all cluster around the three degrees centigrade range for a doubling
619580	621220	of CO2.
621220	624740	He's absolutely sure it'll be a lot less.
624740	626540	OK, why?
626540	630460	There's no doubt that putting additional CO2 into a particular closed system is going to
630460	631820	increase the temperature.
631820	636260	What people don't generally understand is this idea of the multiplier, that they can't
636260	640020	get to the catastrophic numbers that perhaps they want to get in order to get the scare
640020	641220	money from the government.
641220	642820	So they have this magic multiplier.
642820	646140	OK, I think I understand the problem.
646140	651040	Whenever someone takes a scientific fact and calls it magic, what he usually means is he
651040	653740	doesn't understand how it works.
653740	658500	And the part of the theory Molyneux doesn't get is what's called positive feedback.
658500	660700	I've explained this before in my videos.
660700	666000	A doubling of CO2 on its own would cause warming of just over one degree centigrade.
666000	670480	And Molyneux seems to accept this, and so does his most recent guest.
670480	674960	So one degree is not enough to worry anyone, you know, it's probably good for the earth,
674960	680000	you know, I would like to have a little longer growing season, all my backyard garden has
680000	684720	been killed by frost and I would have gotten a better crop this year, we'd have had a few
684720	686200	more growing days.
686200	688720	Well, never mind all that.
688720	693200	So we accept the calculation of climatologists that there'll be about one degree of warming
693200	695440	due to a doubling of CO2.
695440	699680	And when you increase the temperature of the earth by one degree centigrade, climatologists
699680	706020	say a few things start to happen that increase the temperature even more, what Stefan calls
706020	708200	the magic multiplier.
708200	714640	So let's see if it really is magic or basic physics that pretty much anyone can grasp.
714640	727240	All you have to do is look at each of these multipliers and say whether you think it's
727240	729960	physics or magic.
729960	731380	Let's start with this one.
731380	735240	As global temperatures increase, more water evaporates.
735240	736900	Physics or magic?
736900	738360	That one's physics.
738360	741500	And warmer air can hold more of this water vapour.
741500	743200	That's also physics.
743200	746440	And water vapour is a powerful greenhouse gas.
746440	747980	Physics.
747980	752920	So from a one degree rise in temperature due to a doubling of CO2, the water vapour content
752920	757280	of the atmosphere will increase, causing further warming.
757280	762120	Those who said magic, I'm sorry, it's all very basic physics.
762120	765160	Next positive feedback factor, albedo.
765160	769960	White surfaces reflect solar radiation while dark surfaces absorb it.
769960	774680	So ice, which is white, reflects most of the solar energy that falls on it, while the
774680	777080	darker ocean absorbs it.
777080	778080	Did you say magic?
778080	780640	No, sorry, that's physics.
780640	785440	So as ice melts and reveals the darker ocean underneath, the Earth reflects less solar
785440	790280	radiation back into space and absorbs more, causing more warming.
790280	793960	No, not magic, again, that's physics.
793960	798720	Next, the more concerned we get about global warming, the more likely it is that the gods
798720	802720	on Olympus will step in and make everything right again.
802720	804280	Physics or magic?
804280	806440	OK, that one is magic.
806440	811240	I could add feedback factors like melting permafrost that causes the release of large
811240	816120	quantities of methane, an even more powerful greenhouse gas than carbon dioxide.
816120	817560	But I won't labour the point.
817560	820600	These are all basic principles of physics.
820600	826340	They're not magic and they're not mysteries, unless of course you don't know about them.
826340	830680	As for the idea that these physical principles were somehow invented in order to get scare
830680	835480	money from the government, OK, perhaps I've exaggerated what Molyneux said slightly.
835480	839140	They can't get to the catastrophic numbers that perhaps they want to get in order to
839140	840620	get the scare money from the government.
840620	843040	No, he really did say that.
843040	847480	Once again, it's a conspiracy theory that doesn't match reality.
847480	851740	The conclusion that an increase in forcing would lead to positive feedback has been around
851740	853160	for decades.
853160	857320	The National Academy of Sciences described the factors involved in positive feedback
857320	859920	as far back as 1979.
859920	865080	Charles Keeling of the Scripps Institute wrote about them in 1969.
865080	870720	So it was the discovery of positive feedback that led to the calculation of increased temperature,
870720	872640	not the other way round.
872640	877640	If Molyneux ever gets to see this video, I'd like him to clarify if he still thinks positive
877640	881960	feedback is magic, or if he accepts that it's physics.
881960	887920	And does he think the conspiracy to hoax us really did begin in the 1960s?
887920	892520	Molyneux's rejection of positive feedback, the magic multiplier as he calls it, is not
892520	897360	just because he doesn't understand how it works, it's also based on his misunderstanding
897360	899560	of the Earth's geological history.
899560	903200	It's kind of a common sense thing, and given that CO2 was far higher in the past than it
903200	907400	is now, if runaway CO2 was going to happen, it would have happened a lot long before we
907400	911080	had the chance to evolve the capacity to come up with a global warming theory.
911080	916240	Yes, it did happen in the past, and you're simply unaware of the fact.
916240	921080	If Molyneux had chosen to interview a paleoclimatologist, then maybe he would have been told about the
921080	926920	periods in geological history where we had very strong warming because of rising CO2
926920	927920	levels.
927920	932520	There was the Cambrian hyper-warming event when carbon dioxide levels rose so much, reaching
932520	937240	levels 20 times higher than today, that they triggered feedback processes that turned a
937240	940060	frozen planet into a hot house.
940060	945120	Even though the Sun was 4% weaker than today, these processes even melted the ice at the
945120	946420	poles.
946420	950940	To take another example, at the end of the Permian, carbon dioxide released by flood
950940	956100	basalt warmed the Earth so much that methane hydrates on the ocean floor were released,
956100	960900	sending temperatures even higher, because methane is another powerful greenhouse gas
960900	962980	that breaks down to form carbon dioxide.
962980	968180	It's another example of positive feedback, and again the Earth became a hot house and
968180	970140	the ice caps melted.
970140	974160	Closer to home, we've seen very strong warming at the end of each glaciation.
974160	978320	The warming was triggered by a small increase in solar forcing, but it was the positive
978320	983060	feedback that resulted from this that melted ice sheets the size of continents several
983060	985340	miles deep.
985340	990220	Whether you want to call this runaway warming, or warming that causes the ice at both poles
990220	995940	to disappear, or even use the term that scientists use, which is hyper-warming, is entirely up
995940	997020	to you.
997020	1000700	Whatever you want to call it, the fact remains that the average temperature of the Earth
1000700	1008420	over the last 500 million years has ranged from about 10°C to 22°C, warming and cooling
1008420	1013140	between these extremes not once, but several times.
1013140	1017380	Now please don't pose comments like, nya nya, and this happened long before cars and
1017380	1022320	humans came along, because firstly scientists have concluded that the cause of these warming
1022320	1025940	and cooling events was changes in CO2 concentration.
1025940	1031180	Yes, despite what the bloggers may have led you to believe, researchers have shown a very
1031180	1037100	clear correlation between temperature and CO2 over the last 500 million years.
1037100	1042900	The reason for the discrepancy is that bloggers conveniently leave out growing solar power.
1042900	1046500	And secondly, you might accept that there were extreme ranges of temperature in the
1046500	1051900	past, well done, but we're dealing in this video with Molyneux's belief, which is that
1051900	1054900	global temperature has always been stable.
1054900	1058260	And if you want to argue that the warming never reached the point where we became as
1058260	1063340	hot as Venus, of course it didn't, for the same reason that when you leave your car in
1063340	1068340	the hot sun with the windows up, it heats up, but never reaches the point where the
1068340	1069620	inside melts.
1069620	1073380	I've explained this physical principle before in my videos.
1073380	1079580	There must be mechanisms by which any sort of big spike or change in the system is self-correcting.
1079580	1081300	Why must there be?
1081300	1085680	It's lovely to have dreams and hopes, but we're not living in the world of Hollywood
1085680	1087220	or even magic.
1087220	1091180	We're in the real world where these things actually did happen.
1091180	1095980	If average global temperature rose 12 degrees centigrade in the past because of rises in
1095980	1101380	carbon dioxide levels, what's this imaginary impediment to global temperatures rising around
1101380	1105800	three degrees because of rising carbon dioxide levels today?
1105800	1110780	The problem is Molyneux doesn't even accept that these huge climate swings happened at
1110780	1111780	all.
1111780	1116300	Instead, he just listens to people who have no knowledge on the subject, who simply echo
1116300	1117300	his beliefs.
1117300	1118420	I agree with you.
1118420	1123380	There must be some kind of negative feedback that tends to keep the Earth's temperature
1123380	1124380	about the same.
1124380	1126620	No, it hasn't stayed about the same.
1126620	1128580	Oh, never mind.
1128580	1134020	Look, trying to hope that there's some sort of mechanism that must have created a condition
1134020	1138660	that didn't exist is like making a wish within a dream.
1138660	1143860	Stefan, why not learn about real climate science from people other than those who echo your
1143860	1146220	belief that it's all a conspiracy?
1146220	1150540	I'm sure it won't change your conviction that it is all a conspiracy, but at least you can
1150540	1155220	now concentrate on trying to show that these conclusions are wrong instead of believing
1155220	1157220	they don't exist.
1157220	1161820	I hope you don't mind me being so blunt, but you did, after all, claim that this was your
1161820	1162820	goal.
1162820	1166340	I mean, there's nothing more boring than somebody who's only ever looked at evidence which supports
1166340	1167820	his or her own conclusions.
1167820	1172340	Look at the country evidence, and that will breed, I think, a very important and virtuous
1172340	1172860	humility.
