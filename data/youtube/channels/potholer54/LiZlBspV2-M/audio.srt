1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,220
I don't know why so many people wrote in and asked me to respond to this latest exchange

2
00:00:05,220 --> 00:00:08,340
between Christopher Monckton and Stefan Molyneux.

3
00:00:08,340 --> 00:00:13,020
Molyneux seems quite capable of challenging Monckton's claims himself, because Molyneux

4
00:00:13,020 --> 00:00:15,620
believes in looking at both sides of the issue.

5
00:00:15,620 --> 00:00:19,900
I mean, there's nothing more boring than somebody who's only ever looked at evidence which supports

6
00:00:19,900 --> 00:00:21,380
his or her own conclusions.

7
00:00:21,380 --> 00:00:26,020
Look at the country evidence, and that will breed, I think, a very important and virtuous

8
00:00:26,020 --> 00:00:27,020
humility.

9
00:00:27,040 --> 00:00:30,980
Molyneux listens to Monckton, who represents the side that thinks it's all a conspiracy.

10
00:00:30,980 --> 00:00:35,040
They are about to impose a communist world government on the world.

11
00:00:35,040 --> 00:00:40,140
I'm sure he also listens to research scientists, who explain the evidence that carbon dioxide

12
00:00:40,140 --> 00:00:45,820
has been the primary driver of global temperature for the last 500 million years, and the evidence

13
00:00:45,820 --> 00:00:50,660
that a doubling of carbon dioxide from pre-industrial levels will lead to a temperature rise of

14
00:00:50,660 --> 00:00:54,440
between 2 and 4.5 degrees centigrade.

15
00:00:54,440 --> 00:00:59,020
So let's start with the side that thinks the whole thing's a conspiracy of greedy scientists,

16
00:00:59,020 --> 00:01:03,560
who are perpetrating this hoax to impose a communist world government, or to get rich,

17
00:01:03,560 --> 00:01:08,040
or whatever else that motivates them to write supposedly fraudulent papers.

18
00:01:08,040 --> 00:01:09,800
Right, it's very simple.

19
00:01:09,800 --> 00:01:16,200
The first serious predictions made based on what are called an ensemble of several models

20
00:01:16,200 --> 00:01:21,720
taken together were done by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change.

21
00:01:21,720 --> 00:01:28,280
The rate of global warming is not much more than half of what they originally predicted.

22
00:01:28,280 --> 00:01:33,120
Well, to use the scientific form of rebuttal, that's complete bollocks.

23
00:01:33,120 --> 00:01:37,920
The 1990 prediction was the first by the IPCC, and quite crude.

24
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:41,480
It only looked at warming caused by greenhouse gases.

25
00:01:41,480 --> 00:01:46,520
So short-term and unpredictable variables, like fluctuating solar output and aerosol

26
00:01:46,520 --> 00:01:49,040
pollution, weren't considered.

27
00:01:49,040 --> 00:01:54,340
So if we look at what the IPCC was actually predicting, the temperature trend due to greenhouse

28
00:01:54,340 --> 00:01:58,760
gases, which is the light blue line in this graph, is bang on target.

29
00:01:58,760 --> 00:02:03,600
I bet someone is already typing out a post to say, what good are predictions if they

30
00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:05,760
can't take short-term variables into account?

31
00:02:05,760 --> 00:02:11,560
Well, the answer is that short-term variables are, by definition, short-term.

32
00:02:11,560 --> 00:02:12,900
And they're variable.

33
00:02:12,900 --> 00:02:16,180
They go up and down over a period of a few years.

34
00:02:16,180 --> 00:02:20,820
So they may reduce warming in one part of the projection and increase warming in another

35
00:02:20,820 --> 00:02:21,820
part.

36
00:02:21,820 --> 00:02:27,360
But overall, they make no difference to the long-term trend due to CO2.

37
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:32,140
Even if you want to pretend the IPCC graph was taking these variables into account, the

38
00:02:32,140 --> 00:02:37,820
actual temperature trend is still within the IPCC estimates.

39
00:02:37,820 --> 00:02:41,620
Researchers say that's because the warming effect of carbon dioxide is so strong that

40
00:02:41,620 --> 00:02:46,640
it's overcome all these short-term cooling factors over the last few years and continued

41
00:02:46,640 --> 00:02:49,720
to send temperatures to new record highs.

42
00:02:49,720 --> 00:02:55,480
The only way Moncton can claim it hasn't is to cherry-pick his temperature data set.

43
00:02:55,480 --> 00:02:57,000
He wouldn't do that, would he?

44
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:06,160
In fact, between approximately 1997 and 2014, 2015, there was a period of 18 years and nine

45
00:03:06,160 --> 00:03:09,960
months according to one of the data sets with no global warming at all.

46
00:03:09,960 --> 00:03:13,880
As according to one of the data sets is the key point.

47
00:03:13,880 --> 00:03:15,500
And which one is that?

48
00:03:15,500 --> 00:03:19,220
I'm sure Molyneux is going to ask him, but let's take a look at the data set Moncton's

49
00:03:19,220 --> 00:03:20,780
cherry-picked in the past.

50
00:03:20,780 --> 00:03:23,140
There is the actual record from the scientists.

51
00:03:23,140 --> 00:03:25,500
There is the trend line calculated on it.

52
00:03:25,500 --> 00:03:26,620
It is horizontal.

53
00:03:26,620 --> 00:03:29,420
No warming has happened for 17 years, nine months.

54
00:03:29,420 --> 00:03:34,020
It's the temperature data set from Remote Sensing Systems, RSS.

55
00:03:34,020 --> 00:03:38,900
The RSS data set has been the odd one out for over a decade now because all the other

56
00:03:38,900 --> 00:03:44,280
data sets show clear atmospheric warming over that 18-year period.

57
00:03:44,280 --> 00:03:48,720
Every scientific institute that monitors global temperature agrees that there's been roughly

58
00:03:48,720 --> 00:03:52,400
the same amount of atmospheric warming over that period.

59
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:54,840
All except RSS.

60
00:03:54,840 --> 00:03:58,920
And that's the data set Moncton chose to cite.

61
00:03:58,920 --> 00:04:03,360
Now clearly there's something wrong when everyone's measuring average global temperature

62
00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:06,800
and only one measurement is way out of line.

63
00:04:06,800 --> 00:04:11,580
And Roy Spencer agreed there had to be something wrong with the RSS data.

64
00:04:11,580 --> 00:04:12,580
And there was.

65
00:04:12,580 --> 00:04:17,820
RSS discovered that its data were erroneous because of a miscalculation of diurnal cycle

66
00:04:17,820 --> 00:04:23,440
drift and admitted this error in a paper published in March 2016.

67
00:04:23,440 --> 00:04:27,000
But for some reason, Moncton didn't mention this.

68
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:31,420
So why doesn't Molyneux ask Moncton which data set he's quoting?

69
00:04:31,420 --> 00:04:35,200
And if it's RSS, why didn't he mention the correction?

70
00:04:35,200 --> 00:04:41,020
Moncton asked Moncton why he ignored all the other data sets which all show warming.

71
00:04:41,020 --> 00:04:45,100
Don't worry, as soon as Moncton pauses for breath, I'm sure Molyneux will jump in and

72
00:04:45,100 --> 00:04:47,100
question his claims.

73
00:04:47,100 --> 00:04:52,100
But not yet, because Moncton's already moved on to where he published all this evidence.

74
00:04:52,100 --> 00:04:58,340
I published a paper in the journal of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, the Science Bulletin,

75
00:04:58,340 --> 00:05:03,500
in January of last year in which I pointed out that there were various dubieties, various

76
00:05:03,500 --> 00:05:06,960
uncertainties, various errors in the models that had not...

77
00:05:06,960 --> 00:05:09,160
Well, let's not get carried away.

78
00:05:09,160 --> 00:05:14,140
The journal Moncton's talking about, the Science Bulletin, previously called the Chinese Science

79
00:05:14,140 --> 00:05:18,320
Bulletin, does have a reasonably respected print version.

80
00:05:18,320 --> 00:05:23,920
It's one of many journals that describe themselves as supervised, sponsored or co-sponsored by

81
00:05:23,920 --> 00:05:26,460
the Chinese Academy of Sciences.

82
00:05:26,460 --> 00:05:31,240
But Moncton's paper wasn't published in the print version, it was in the separate online

83
00:05:31,240 --> 00:05:35,940
open access version, and if you want to get a paper published there, you have to stump

84
00:05:35,940 --> 00:05:38,860
up $2,500.

85
00:05:38,860 --> 00:05:43,660
Pay-to-play online journals like this are not highly respected and are often poorly

86
00:05:43,660 --> 00:05:44,660
peer reviewed.

87
00:05:44,660 --> 00:05:49,660
It's a bit like a Vogon paying to have his poetry published in a vanity book of poems

88
00:05:49,660 --> 00:05:53,860
and then claiming it's been published by the Royal Society of Literature.

89
00:05:53,860 --> 00:05:59,060
One climatologist at the University of Reading found what he called glaring fundamental errors

90
00:05:59,060 --> 00:06:00,980
in Moncton's paper.

91
00:06:00,980 --> 00:06:05,680
It shouldn't surprise fans of my Moncton Buncombe video series, which showed that Moncton has

92
00:06:05,680 --> 00:06:08,080
a history of getting his sums wrong.

93
00:06:08,080 --> 00:06:09,640
Here's my own calculation.

94
00:06:09,640 --> 00:06:16,000
And we get 1.6 degrees Celsius as the change in temperature for a doubling of CO2.

95
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:21,480
The warming we would expect to get if we doubled the CO2 concentration in the atmosphere, that

96
00:06:21,480 --> 00:06:27,240
is what's known as climate sensitivity, will be about a fifth of a Celsius degree.

97
00:06:27,240 --> 00:06:29,460
Just a little bit more than a fifth of a Celsius degree.

98
00:06:29,460 --> 00:06:34,180
In his piece in the Forum on Physics and Society newsletter, Moncton gives yet another figure

99
00:06:34,180 --> 00:06:37,640
for temperature rise, 0.58 degrees centigrade.

100
00:06:37,640 --> 00:06:42,360
Apart from the howling error of calling Kelvin degrees Kelvin, which would have earned a

101
00:06:42,360 --> 00:06:46,980
rebuke from any high school physics teacher, Moncton made a bigger mix-up in that last

102
00:06:46,980 --> 00:06:52,560
calculation when he claimed to have divided sensitivity by three, but in fact he erroneously

103
00:06:52,560 --> 00:06:55,240
divided forcing by three.

104
00:06:55,260 --> 00:07:01,620
Facing up forcing and sensitivity is the climatological equivalent of confusing time and distance.

105
00:07:01,620 --> 00:07:06,180
And now Moncton's come up with yet another calculation for the Earth's equilibrium temperature.

106
00:07:06,180 --> 00:07:13,940
I can now prove that the variance either side of the central estimate of global warming

107
00:07:13,940 --> 00:07:19,380
as a result of feedback is now only going to be kind of less than half a Celsius degree.

108
00:07:19,380 --> 00:07:21,700
Well, let's not hold our breath.

109
00:07:21,700 --> 00:07:25,720
Despite having come up with a variety of different calculations over the years, whose

110
00:07:25,720 --> 00:07:31,360
results vary by a factor of eight, not one of Moncton's projections has even come close

111
00:07:31,360 --> 00:07:34,180
to matching actual temperature trends.

112
00:07:34,180 --> 00:07:39,120
He even predicted that global temperatures would follow solar activity downwards when

113
00:07:39,120 --> 00:07:43,220
in fact they followed carbon dioxide levels upwards.

114
00:07:43,220 --> 00:07:48,000
So just ten minutes in and surely there's more than enough for Molyneux to challenge

115
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:51,080
or at least ask for some clarification.

116
00:07:51,080 --> 00:07:56,800
And he will question Moncton's claims, because fortunately for us, Molyneux is a sceptic.

117
00:07:56,800 --> 00:08:05,280
It is strange to me that a scepticism about highly conjectural source data should be considered

118
00:08:05,280 --> 00:08:09,560
anti-scientific when it seems to me that the scientific method is entirely predicated on

119
00:08:09,560 --> 00:08:15,060
the rigorous application of scepticism, particularly to projected or modelled data.

120
00:08:15,060 --> 00:08:16,060
Exactly right.

121
00:08:16,060 --> 00:08:20,940
And here we have projected and modelled data based on a cherry-picked and erroneous data

122
00:08:20,940 --> 00:08:27,100
set from a man with no scientific training and a history of making calculation blunders.

123
00:08:27,100 --> 00:08:28,980
So go for it, Stefan.

124
00:08:28,980 --> 00:08:29,980
Apply that scepticism.

125
00:08:29,980 --> 00:08:36,780
Well, this is, I think, a lot of things that are not understood by people who are pro-global

126
00:08:36,780 --> 00:08:40,380
warming or who have trouble with the sceptics.

127
00:08:40,380 --> 00:08:44,620
Oh dear, I'm a little disappointed in you, Stefan.

128
00:08:44,620 --> 00:08:45,620
Whatever happened to…

129
00:08:45,620 --> 00:08:49,500
…the rigorous application of scepticism, particularly to projected or modelled data.

130
00:08:49,500 --> 00:08:54,540
Well, maybe Molyneux is just giving Moncton free rein, because he also has real climatologists

131
00:08:54,540 --> 00:08:57,940
on his show who present the evidence supporting the science.

132
00:08:57,940 --> 00:08:59,180
Let's see.

133
00:08:59,180 --> 00:09:03,980
He will be speaking at the Global Warming and Inconvenient Lie Conference in Phoenix,

134
00:09:03,980 --> 00:09:04,980
Arizona.

135
00:09:04,980 --> 00:09:07,500
And he is the author of The Moral Case for Fossil Fuels.

136
00:09:07,500 --> 00:09:09,660
He's an expert on energy and industrial policy.

137
00:09:09,660 --> 00:09:13,620
I mean, there's nothing more boring than somebody who's only ever looked at evidence

138
00:09:13,620 --> 00:09:15,820
which supports his or her own conclusions.

139
00:09:15,820 --> 00:09:16,820
What is the problem?

140
00:09:16,820 --> 00:09:17,820
What is the concern?

141
00:09:17,820 --> 00:09:21,540
You pimp your website for a second to make sure that people can go and get to the source

142
00:09:21,540 --> 00:09:22,540
data.

143
00:09:22,540 --> 00:09:23,540
It's climate-sceptic.com.

144
00:09:23,540 --> 00:09:24,540
Is that right?

145
00:09:24,540 --> 00:09:29,540
There is no guarantee that it's going to get warmer just because there's more CO2.

146
00:09:29,540 --> 00:09:30,980
Eh, no.

147
00:09:30,980 --> 00:09:36,100
It turns out that every one of his guests simply echoes the belief that it's all a

148
00:09:36,100 --> 00:09:37,100
conspiracy.

149
00:09:37,100 --> 00:09:40,220
So what does Molyneux believe when it comes to actual science?

150
00:09:40,420 --> 00:09:44,460
There's no question that CO2 is produced by human beings.

151
00:09:44,460 --> 00:09:49,300
There's no question that it has increased over the past, say, 50 or 70 years.

152
00:09:49,300 --> 00:09:53,260
And there's no doubt that it has a warming factor in the atmosphere.

153
00:09:53,260 --> 00:09:57,300
As far as that goes, I mean, anybody who would deny that is having trouble tying their shoelaces

154
00:09:57,300 --> 00:09:59,020
and getting out of the door in the morning.

155
00:09:59,020 --> 00:10:03,940
He just doesn't accept the conclusion of researchers in fields as far apart as volcanology,

156
00:10:03,940 --> 00:10:09,580
glaciology, paleoclimatology, atmospheric physics, who've all done studies independent

157
00:10:09,620 --> 00:10:14,500
of each other, some using models, some looking at temperature responses to past changes in

158
00:10:14,500 --> 00:10:19,580
CO2, whose results all cluster around the three degrees centigrade range for a doubling

159
00:10:19,580 --> 00:10:21,220
of CO2.

160
00:10:21,220 --> 00:10:24,740
He's absolutely sure it'll be a lot less.

161
00:10:24,740 --> 00:10:26,540
OK, why?

162
00:10:26,540 --> 00:10:30,460
There's no doubt that putting additional CO2 into a particular closed system is going to

163
00:10:30,460 --> 00:10:31,820
increase the temperature.

164
00:10:31,820 --> 00:10:36,260
What people don't generally understand is this idea of the multiplier, that they can't

165
00:10:36,260 --> 00:10:40,020
get to the catastrophic numbers that perhaps they want to get in order to get the scare

166
00:10:40,020 --> 00:10:41,220
money from the government.

167
00:10:41,220 --> 00:10:42,820
So they have this magic multiplier.

168
00:10:42,820 --> 00:10:46,140
OK, I think I understand the problem.

169
00:10:46,140 --> 00:10:51,040
Whenever someone takes a scientific fact and calls it magic, what he usually means is he

170
00:10:51,040 --> 00:10:53,740
doesn't understand how it works.

171
00:10:53,740 --> 00:10:58,500
And the part of the theory Molyneux doesn't get is what's called positive feedback.

172
00:10:58,500 --> 00:11:00,700
I've explained this before in my videos.

173
00:11:00,700 --> 00:11:06,000
A doubling of CO2 on its own would cause warming of just over one degree centigrade.

174
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:10,480
And Molyneux seems to accept this, and so does his most recent guest.

175
00:11:10,480 --> 00:11:14,960
So one degree is not enough to worry anyone, you know, it's probably good for the earth,

176
00:11:14,960 --> 00:11:20,000
you know, I would like to have a little longer growing season, all my backyard garden has

177
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:24,720
been killed by frost and I would have gotten a better crop this year, we'd have had a few

178
00:11:24,720 --> 00:11:26,200
more growing days.

179
00:11:26,200 --> 00:11:28,720
Well, never mind all that.

180
00:11:28,720 --> 00:11:33,200
So we accept the calculation of climatologists that there'll be about one degree of warming

181
00:11:33,200 --> 00:11:35,440
due to a doubling of CO2.

182
00:11:35,440 --> 00:11:39,680
And when you increase the temperature of the earth by one degree centigrade, climatologists

183
00:11:39,680 --> 00:11:46,020
say a few things start to happen that increase the temperature even more, what Stefan calls

184
00:11:46,020 --> 00:11:48,200
the magic multiplier.

185
00:11:48,200 --> 00:11:54,640
So let's see if it really is magic or basic physics that pretty much anyone can grasp.

186
00:11:54,640 --> 00:12:07,240
All you have to do is look at each of these multipliers and say whether you think it's

187
00:12:07,240 --> 00:12:09,960
physics or magic.

188
00:12:09,960 --> 00:12:11,380
Let's start with this one.

189
00:12:11,380 --> 00:12:15,240
As global temperatures increase, more water evaporates.

190
00:12:15,240 --> 00:12:16,900
Physics or magic?

191
00:12:16,900 --> 00:12:18,360
That one's physics.

192
00:12:18,360 --> 00:12:21,500
And warmer air can hold more of this water vapour.

193
00:12:21,500 --> 00:12:23,200
That's also physics.

194
00:12:23,200 --> 00:12:26,440
And water vapour is a powerful greenhouse gas.

195
00:12:26,440 --> 00:12:27,980
Physics.

196
00:12:27,980 --> 00:12:32,920
So from a one degree rise in temperature due to a doubling of CO2, the water vapour content

197
00:12:32,920 --> 00:12:37,280
of the atmosphere will increase, causing further warming.

198
00:12:37,280 --> 00:12:42,120
Those who said magic, I'm sorry, it's all very basic physics.

199
00:12:42,120 --> 00:12:45,160
Next positive feedback factor, albedo.

200
00:12:45,160 --> 00:12:49,960
White surfaces reflect solar radiation while dark surfaces absorb it.

201
00:12:49,960 --> 00:12:54,680
So ice, which is white, reflects most of the solar energy that falls on it, while the

202
00:12:54,680 --> 00:12:57,080
darker ocean absorbs it.

203
00:12:57,080 --> 00:12:58,080
Did you say magic?

204
00:12:58,080 --> 00:13:00,640
No, sorry, that's physics.

205
00:13:00,640 --> 00:13:05,440
So as ice melts and reveals the darker ocean underneath, the Earth reflects less solar

206
00:13:05,440 --> 00:13:10,280
radiation back into space and absorbs more, causing more warming.

207
00:13:10,280 --> 00:13:13,960
No, not magic, again, that's physics.

208
00:13:13,960 --> 00:13:18,720
Next, the more concerned we get about global warming, the more likely it is that the gods

209
00:13:18,720 --> 00:13:22,720
on Olympus will step in and make everything right again.

210
00:13:22,720 --> 00:13:24,280
Physics or magic?

211
00:13:24,280 --> 00:13:26,440
OK, that one is magic.

212
00:13:26,440 --> 00:13:31,240
I could add feedback factors like melting permafrost that causes the release of large

213
00:13:31,240 --> 00:13:36,120
quantities of methane, an even more powerful greenhouse gas than carbon dioxide.

214
00:13:36,120 --> 00:13:37,560
But I won't labour the point.

215
00:13:37,560 --> 00:13:40,600
These are all basic principles of physics.

216
00:13:40,600 --> 00:13:46,340
They're not magic and they're not mysteries, unless of course you don't know about them.

217
00:13:46,340 --> 00:13:50,680
As for the idea that these physical principles were somehow invented in order to get scare

218
00:13:50,680 --> 00:13:55,480
money from the government, OK, perhaps I've exaggerated what Molyneux said slightly.

219
00:13:55,480 --> 00:13:59,140
They can't get to the catastrophic numbers that perhaps they want to get in order to

220
00:13:59,140 --> 00:14:00,620
get the scare money from the government.

221
00:14:00,620 --> 00:14:03,040
No, he really did say that.

222
00:14:03,040 --> 00:14:07,480
Once again, it's a conspiracy theory that doesn't match reality.

223
00:14:07,480 --> 00:14:11,740
The conclusion that an increase in forcing would lead to positive feedback has been around

224
00:14:11,740 --> 00:14:13,160
for decades.

225
00:14:13,160 --> 00:14:17,320
The National Academy of Sciences described the factors involved in positive feedback

226
00:14:17,320 --> 00:14:19,920
as far back as 1979.

227
00:14:19,920 --> 00:14:25,080
Charles Keeling of the Scripps Institute wrote about them in 1969.

228
00:14:25,080 --> 00:14:30,720
So it was the discovery of positive feedback that led to the calculation of increased temperature,

229
00:14:30,720 --> 00:14:32,640
not the other way round.

230
00:14:32,640 --> 00:14:37,640
If Molyneux ever gets to see this video, I'd like him to clarify if he still thinks positive

231
00:14:37,640 --> 00:14:41,960
feedback is magic, or if he accepts that it's physics.

232
00:14:41,960 --> 00:14:47,920
And does he think the conspiracy to hoax us really did begin in the 1960s?

233
00:14:47,920 --> 00:14:52,520
Molyneux's rejection of positive feedback, the magic multiplier as he calls it, is not

234
00:14:52,520 --> 00:14:57,360
just because he doesn't understand how it works, it's also based on his misunderstanding

235
00:14:57,360 --> 00:14:59,560
of the Earth's geological history.

236
00:14:59,560 --> 00:15:03,200
It's kind of a common sense thing, and given that CO2 was far higher in the past than it

237
00:15:03,200 --> 00:15:07,400
is now, if runaway CO2 was going to happen, it would have happened a lot long before we

238
00:15:07,400 --> 00:15:11,080
had the chance to evolve the capacity to come up with a global warming theory.

239
00:15:11,080 --> 00:15:16,240
Yes, it did happen in the past, and you're simply unaware of the fact.

240
00:15:16,240 --> 00:15:21,080
If Molyneux had chosen to interview a paleoclimatologist, then maybe he would have been told about the

241
00:15:21,080 --> 00:15:26,920
periods in geological history where we had very strong warming because of rising CO2

242
00:15:26,920 --> 00:15:27,920
levels.

243
00:15:27,920 --> 00:15:32,520
There was the Cambrian hyper-warming event when carbon dioxide levels rose so much, reaching

244
00:15:32,520 --> 00:15:37,240
levels 20 times higher than today, that they triggered feedback processes that turned a

245
00:15:37,240 --> 00:15:40,060
frozen planet into a hot house.

246
00:15:40,060 --> 00:15:45,120
Even though the Sun was 4% weaker than today, these processes even melted the ice at the

247
00:15:45,120 --> 00:15:46,420
poles.

248
00:15:46,420 --> 00:15:50,940
To take another example, at the end of the Permian, carbon dioxide released by flood

249
00:15:50,940 --> 00:15:56,100
basalt warmed the Earth so much that methane hydrates on the ocean floor were released,

250
00:15:56,100 --> 00:16:00,900
sending temperatures even higher, because methane is another powerful greenhouse gas

251
00:16:00,900 --> 00:16:02,980
that breaks down to form carbon dioxide.

252
00:16:02,980 --> 00:16:08,180
It's another example of positive feedback, and again the Earth became a hot house and

253
00:16:08,180 --> 00:16:10,140
the ice caps melted.

254
00:16:10,140 --> 00:16:14,160
Closer to home, we've seen very strong warming at the end of each glaciation.

255
00:16:14,160 --> 00:16:18,320
The warming was triggered by a small increase in solar forcing, but it was the positive

256
00:16:18,320 --> 00:16:23,060
feedback that resulted from this that melted ice sheets the size of continents several

257
00:16:23,060 --> 00:16:25,340
miles deep.

258
00:16:25,340 --> 00:16:30,220
Whether you want to call this runaway warming, or warming that causes the ice at both poles

259
00:16:30,220 --> 00:16:35,940
to disappear, or even use the term that scientists use, which is hyper-warming, is entirely up

260
00:16:35,940 --> 00:16:37,020
to you.

261
00:16:37,020 --> 00:16:40,700
Whatever you want to call it, the fact remains that the average temperature of the Earth

262
00:16:40,700 --> 00:16:48,420
over the last 500 million years has ranged from about 10°C to 22°C, warming and cooling

263
00:16:48,420 --> 00:16:53,140
between these extremes not once, but several times.

264
00:16:53,140 --> 00:16:57,380
Now please don't pose comments like, nya nya, and this happened long before cars and

265
00:16:57,380 --> 00:17:02,320
humans came along, because firstly scientists have concluded that the cause of these warming

266
00:17:02,320 --> 00:17:05,940
and cooling events was changes in CO2 concentration.

267
00:17:05,940 --> 00:17:11,180
Yes, despite what the bloggers may have led you to believe, researchers have shown a very

268
00:17:11,180 --> 00:17:17,100
clear correlation between temperature and CO2 over the last 500 million years.

269
00:17:17,100 --> 00:17:22,900
The reason for the discrepancy is that bloggers conveniently leave out growing solar power.

270
00:17:22,900 --> 00:17:26,500
And secondly, you might accept that there were extreme ranges of temperature in the

271
00:17:26,500 --> 00:17:31,900
past, well done, but we're dealing in this video with Molyneux's belief, which is that

272
00:17:31,900 --> 00:17:34,900
global temperature has always been stable.

273
00:17:34,900 --> 00:17:38,260
And if you want to argue that the warming never reached the point where we became as

274
00:17:38,260 --> 00:17:43,340
hot as Venus, of course it didn't, for the same reason that when you leave your car in

275
00:17:43,340 --> 00:17:48,340
the hot sun with the windows up, it heats up, but never reaches the point where the

276
00:17:48,340 --> 00:17:49,620
inside melts.

277
00:17:49,620 --> 00:17:53,380
I've explained this physical principle before in my videos.

278
00:17:53,380 --> 00:17:59,580
There must be mechanisms by which any sort of big spike or change in the system is self-correcting.

279
00:17:59,580 --> 00:18:01,300
Why must there be?

280
00:18:01,300 --> 00:18:05,680
It's lovely to have dreams and hopes, but we're not living in the world of Hollywood

281
00:18:05,680 --> 00:18:07,220
or even magic.

282
00:18:07,220 --> 00:18:11,180
We're in the real world where these things actually did happen.

283
00:18:11,180 --> 00:18:15,980
If average global temperature rose 12 degrees centigrade in the past because of rises in

284
00:18:15,980 --> 00:18:21,380
carbon dioxide levels, what's this imaginary impediment to global temperatures rising around

285
00:18:21,380 --> 00:18:25,800
three degrees because of rising carbon dioxide levels today?

286
00:18:25,800 --> 00:18:30,780
The problem is Molyneux doesn't even accept that these huge climate swings happened at

287
00:18:30,780 --> 00:18:31,780
all.

288
00:18:31,780 --> 00:18:36,300
Instead, he just listens to people who have no knowledge on the subject, who simply echo

289
00:18:36,300 --> 00:18:37,300
his beliefs.

290
00:18:37,300 --> 00:18:38,420
I agree with you.

291
00:18:38,420 --> 00:18:43,380
There must be some kind of negative feedback that tends to keep the Earth's temperature

292
00:18:43,380 --> 00:18:44,380
about the same.

293
00:18:44,380 --> 00:18:46,620
No, it hasn't stayed about the same.

294
00:18:46,620 --> 00:18:48,580
Oh, never mind.

295
00:18:48,580 --> 00:18:54,020
Look, trying to hope that there's some sort of mechanism that must have created a condition

296
00:18:54,020 --> 00:18:58,660
that didn't exist is like making a wish within a dream.

297
00:18:58,660 --> 00:19:03,860
Stefan, why not learn about real climate science from people other than those who echo your

298
00:19:03,860 --> 00:19:06,220
belief that it's all a conspiracy?

299
00:19:06,220 --> 00:19:10,540
I'm sure it won't change your conviction that it is all a conspiracy, but at least you can

300
00:19:10,540 --> 00:19:15,220
now concentrate on trying to show that these conclusions are wrong instead of believing

301
00:19:15,220 --> 00:19:17,220
they don't exist.

302
00:19:17,220 --> 00:19:21,820
I hope you don't mind me being so blunt, but you did, after all, claim that this was your

303
00:19:21,820 --> 00:19:22,820
goal.

304
00:19:22,820 --> 00:19:26,340
I mean, there's nothing more boring than somebody who's only ever looked at evidence which supports

305
00:19:26,340 --> 00:19:27,820
his or her own conclusions.

306
00:19:27,820 --> 00:19:32,340
Look at the country evidence, and that will breed, I think, a very important and virtuous

307
00:19:32,340 --> 00:19:32,860
humility.
