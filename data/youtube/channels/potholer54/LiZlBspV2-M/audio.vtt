00:00.000 --> 00:05.220
I don't know why so many people wrote in and asked me to respond to this latest exchange

00:05.220 --> 00:08.340
between Christopher Monckton and Stefan Molyneux.

00:08.340 --> 00:13.020
Molyneux seems quite capable of challenging Monckton's claims himself, because Molyneux

00:13.020 --> 00:15.620
believes in looking at both sides of the issue.

00:15.620 --> 00:19.900
I mean, there's nothing more boring than somebody who's only ever looked at evidence which supports

00:19.900 --> 00:21.380
his or her own conclusions.

00:21.380 --> 00:26.020
Look at the country evidence, and that will breed, I think, a very important and virtuous

00:26.020 --> 00:27.020
humility.

00:27.040 --> 00:30.980
Molyneux listens to Monckton, who represents the side that thinks it's all a conspiracy.

00:30.980 --> 00:35.040
They are about to impose a communist world government on the world.

00:35.040 --> 00:40.140
I'm sure he also listens to research scientists, who explain the evidence that carbon dioxide

00:40.140 --> 00:45.820
has been the primary driver of global temperature for the last 500 million years, and the evidence

00:45.820 --> 00:50.660
that a doubling of carbon dioxide from pre-industrial levels will lead to a temperature rise of

00:50.660 --> 00:54.440
between 2 and 4.5 degrees centigrade.

00:54.440 --> 00:59.020
So let's start with the side that thinks the whole thing's a conspiracy of greedy scientists,

00:59.020 --> 01:03.560
who are perpetrating this hoax to impose a communist world government, or to get rich,

01:03.560 --> 01:08.040
or whatever else that motivates them to write supposedly fraudulent papers.

01:08.040 --> 01:09.800
Right, it's very simple.

01:09.800 --> 01:16.200
The first serious predictions made based on what are called an ensemble of several models

01:16.200 --> 01:21.720
taken together were done by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change.

01:21.720 --> 01:28.280
The rate of global warming is not much more than half of what they originally predicted.

01:28.280 --> 01:33.120
Well, to use the scientific form of rebuttal, that's complete bollocks.

01:33.120 --> 01:37.920
The 1990 prediction was the first by the IPCC, and quite crude.

01:37.920 --> 01:41.480
It only looked at warming caused by greenhouse gases.

01:41.480 --> 01:46.520
So short-term and unpredictable variables, like fluctuating solar output and aerosol

01:46.520 --> 01:49.040
pollution, weren't considered.

01:49.040 --> 01:54.340
So if we look at what the IPCC was actually predicting, the temperature trend due to greenhouse

01:54.340 --> 01:58.760
gases, which is the light blue line in this graph, is bang on target.

01:58.760 --> 02:03.600
I bet someone is already typing out a post to say, what good are predictions if they

02:03.600 --> 02:05.760
can't take short-term variables into account?

02:05.760 --> 02:11.560
Well, the answer is that short-term variables are, by definition, short-term.

02:11.560 --> 02:12.900
And they're variable.

02:12.900 --> 02:16.180
They go up and down over a period of a few years.

02:16.180 --> 02:20.820
So they may reduce warming in one part of the projection and increase warming in another

02:20.820 --> 02:21.820
part.

02:21.820 --> 02:27.360
But overall, they make no difference to the long-term trend due to CO2.

02:27.360 --> 02:32.140
Even if you want to pretend the IPCC graph was taking these variables into account, the

02:32.140 --> 02:37.820
actual temperature trend is still within the IPCC estimates.

02:37.820 --> 02:41.620
Researchers say that's because the warming effect of carbon dioxide is so strong that

02:41.620 --> 02:46.640
it's overcome all these short-term cooling factors over the last few years and continued

02:46.640 --> 02:49.720
to send temperatures to new record highs.

02:49.720 --> 02:55.480
The only way Moncton can claim it hasn't is to cherry-pick his temperature data set.

02:55.480 --> 02:57.000
He wouldn't do that, would he?

02:57.000 --> 03:06.160
In fact, between approximately 1997 and 2014, 2015, there was a period of 18 years and nine

03:06.160 --> 03:09.960
months according to one of the data sets with no global warming at all.

03:09.960 --> 03:13.880
As according to one of the data sets is the key point.

03:13.880 --> 03:15.500
And which one is that?

03:15.500 --> 03:19.220
I'm sure Molyneux is going to ask him, but let's take a look at the data set Moncton's

03:19.220 --> 03:20.780
cherry-picked in the past.

03:20.780 --> 03:23.140
There is the actual record from the scientists.

03:23.140 --> 03:25.500
There is the trend line calculated on it.

03:25.500 --> 03:26.620
It is horizontal.

03:26.620 --> 03:29.420
No warming has happened for 17 years, nine months.

03:29.420 --> 03:34.020
It's the temperature data set from Remote Sensing Systems, RSS.

03:34.020 --> 03:38.900
The RSS data set has been the odd one out for over a decade now because all the other

03:38.900 --> 03:44.280
data sets show clear atmospheric warming over that 18-year period.

03:44.280 --> 03:48.720
Every scientific institute that monitors global temperature agrees that there's been roughly

03:48.720 --> 03:52.400
the same amount of atmospheric warming over that period.

03:52.400 --> 03:54.840
All except RSS.

03:54.840 --> 03:58.920
And that's the data set Moncton chose to cite.

03:58.920 --> 04:03.360
Now clearly there's something wrong when everyone's measuring average global temperature

04:03.360 --> 04:06.800
and only one measurement is way out of line.

04:06.800 --> 04:11.580
And Roy Spencer agreed there had to be something wrong with the RSS data.

04:11.580 --> 04:12.580
And there was.

04:12.580 --> 04:17.820
RSS discovered that its data were erroneous because of a miscalculation of diurnal cycle

04:17.820 --> 04:23.440
drift and admitted this error in a paper published in March 2016.

04:23.440 --> 04:27.000
But for some reason, Moncton didn't mention this.

04:27.000 --> 04:31.420
So why doesn't Molyneux ask Moncton which data set he's quoting?

04:31.420 --> 04:35.200
And if it's RSS, why didn't he mention the correction?

04:35.200 --> 04:41.020
Moncton asked Moncton why he ignored all the other data sets which all show warming.

04:41.020 --> 04:45.100
Don't worry, as soon as Moncton pauses for breath, I'm sure Molyneux will jump in and

04:45.100 --> 04:47.100
question his claims.

04:47.100 --> 04:52.100
But not yet, because Moncton's already moved on to where he published all this evidence.

04:52.100 --> 04:58.340
I published a paper in the journal of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, the Science Bulletin,

04:58.340 --> 05:03.500
in January of last year in which I pointed out that there were various dubieties, various

05:03.500 --> 05:06.960
uncertainties, various errors in the models that had not...

05:06.960 --> 05:09.160
Well, let's not get carried away.

05:09.160 --> 05:14.140
The journal Moncton's talking about, the Science Bulletin, previously called the Chinese Science

05:14.140 --> 05:18.320
Bulletin, does have a reasonably respected print version.

05:18.320 --> 05:23.920
It's one of many journals that describe themselves as supervised, sponsored or co-sponsored by

05:23.920 --> 05:26.460
the Chinese Academy of Sciences.

05:26.460 --> 05:31.240
But Moncton's paper wasn't published in the print version, it was in the separate online

05:31.240 --> 05:35.940
open access version, and if you want to get a paper published there, you have to stump

05:35.940 --> 05:38.860
up $2,500.

05:38.860 --> 05:43.660
Pay-to-play online journals like this are not highly respected and are often poorly

05:43.660 --> 05:44.660
peer reviewed.

05:44.660 --> 05:49.660
It's a bit like a Vogon paying to have his poetry published in a vanity book of poems

05:49.660 --> 05:53.860
and then claiming it's been published by the Royal Society of Literature.

05:53.860 --> 05:59.060
One climatologist at the University of Reading found what he called glaring fundamental errors

05:59.060 --> 06:00.980
in Moncton's paper.

06:00.980 --> 06:05.680
It shouldn't surprise fans of my Moncton Buncombe video series, which showed that Moncton has

06:05.680 --> 06:08.080
a history of getting his sums wrong.

06:08.080 --> 06:09.640
Here's my own calculation.

06:09.640 --> 06:16.000
And we get 1.6 degrees Celsius as the change in temperature for a doubling of CO2.

06:16.000 --> 06:21.480
The warming we would expect to get if we doubled the CO2 concentration in the atmosphere, that

06:21.480 --> 06:27.240
is what's known as climate sensitivity, will be about a fifth of a Celsius degree.

06:27.240 --> 06:29.460
Just a little bit more than a fifth of a Celsius degree.

06:29.460 --> 06:34.180
In his piece in the Forum on Physics and Society newsletter, Moncton gives yet another figure

06:34.180 --> 06:37.640
for temperature rise, 0.58 degrees centigrade.

06:37.640 --> 06:42.360
Apart from the howling error of calling Kelvin degrees Kelvin, which would have earned a

06:42.360 --> 06:46.980
rebuke from any high school physics teacher, Moncton made a bigger mix-up in that last

06:46.980 --> 06:52.560
calculation when he claimed to have divided sensitivity by three, but in fact he erroneously

06:52.560 --> 06:55.240
divided forcing by three.

06:55.260 --> 07:01.620
Facing up forcing and sensitivity is the climatological equivalent of confusing time and distance.

07:01.620 --> 07:06.180
And now Moncton's come up with yet another calculation for the Earth's equilibrium temperature.

07:06.180 --> 07:13.940
I can now prove that the variance either side of the central estimate of global warming

07:13.940 --> 07:19.380
as a result of feedback is now only going to be kind of less than half a Celsius degree.

07:19.380 --> 07:21.700
Well, let's not hold our breath.

07:21.700 --> 07:25.720
Despite having come up with a variety of different calculations over the years, whose

07:25.720 --> 07:31.360
results vary by a factor of eight, not one of Moncton's projections has even come close

07:31.360 --> 07:34.180
to matching actual temperature trends.

07:34.180 --> 07:39.120
He even predicted that global temperatures would follow solar activity downwards when

07:39.120 --> 07:43.220
in fact they followed carbon dioxide levels upwards.

07:43.220 --> 07:48.000
So just ten minutes in and surely there's more than enough for Molyneux to challenge

07:48.000 --> 07:51.080
or at least ask for some clarification.

07:51.080 --> 07:56.800
And he will question Moncton's claims, because fortunately for us, Molyneux is a sceptic.

07:56.800 --> 08:05.280
It is strange to me that a scepticism about highly conjectural source data should be considered

08:05.280 --> 08:09.560
anti-scientific when it seems to me that the scientific method is entirely predicated on

08:09.560 --> 08:15.060
the rigorous application of scepticism, particularly to projected or modelled data.

08:15.060 --> 08:16.060
Exactly right.

08:16.060 --> 08:20.940
And here we have projected and modelled data based on a cherry-picked and erroneous data

08:20.940 --> 08:27.100
set from a man with no scientific training and a history of making calculation blunders.

08:27.100 --> 08:28.980
So go for it, Stefan.

08:28.980 --> 08:29.980
Apply that scepticism.

08:29.980 --> 08:36.780
Well, this is, I think, a lot of things that are not understood by people who are pro-global

08:36.780 --> 08:40.380
warming or who have trouble with the sceptics.

08:40.380 --> 08:44.620
Oh dear, I'm a little disappointed in you, Stefan.

08:44.620 --> 08:45.620
Whatever happened to…

08:45.620 --> 08:49.500
…the rigorous application of scepticism, particularly to projected or modelled data.

08:49.500 --> 08:54.540
Well, maybe Molyneux is just giving Moncton free rein, because he also has real climatologists

08:54.540 --> 08:57.940
on his show who present the evidence supporting the science.

08:57.940 --> 08:59.180
Let's see.

08:59.180 --> 09:03.980
He will be speaking at the Global Warming and Inconvenient Lie Conference in Phoenix,

09:03.980 --> 09:04.980
Arizona.

09:04.980 --> 09:07.500
And he is the author of The Moral Case for Fossil Fuels.

09:07.500 --> 09:09.660
He's an expert on energy and industrial policy.

09:09.660 --> 09:13.620
I mean, there's nothing more boring than somebody who's only ever looked at evidence

09:13.620 --> 09:15.820
which supports his or her own conclusions.

09:15.820 --> 09:16.820
What is the problem?

09:16.820 --> 09:17.820
What is the concern?

09:17.820 --> 09:21.540
You pimp your website for a second to make sure that people can go and get to the source

09:21.540 --> 09:22.540
data.

09:22.540 --> 09:23.540
It's climate-sceptic.com.

09:23.540 --> 09:24.540
Is that right?

09:24.540 --> 09:29.540
There is no guarantee that it's going to get warmer just because there's more CO2.

09:29.540 --> 09:30.980
Eh, no.

09:30.980 --> 09:36.100
It turns out that every one of his guests simply echoes the belief that it's all a

09:36.100 --> 09:37.100
conspiracy.

09:37.100 --> 09:40.220
So what does Molyneux believe when it comes to actual science?

09:40.420 --> 09:44.460
There's no question that CO2 is produced by human beings.

09:44.460 --> 09:49.300
There's no question that it has increased over the past, say, 50 or 70 years.

09:49.300 --> 09:53.260
And there's no doubt that it has a warming factor in the atmosphere.

09:53.260 --> 09:57.300
As far as that goes, I mean, anybody who would deny that is having trouble tying their shoelaces

09:57.300 --> 09:59.020
and getting out of the door in the morning.

09:59.020 --> 10:03.940
He just doesn't accept the conclusion of researchers in fields as far apart as volcanology,

10:03.940 --> 10:09.580
glaciology, paleoclimatology, atmospheric physics, who've all done studies independent

10:09.620 --> 10:14.500
of each other, some using models, some looking at temperature responses to past changes in

10:14.500 --> 10:19.580
CO2, whose results all cluster around the three degrees centigrade range for a doubling

10:19.580 --> 10:21.220
of CO2.

10:21.220 --> 10:24.740
He's absolutely sure it'll be a lot less.

10:24.740 --> 10:26.540
OK, why?

10:26.540 --> 10:30.460
There's no doubt that putting additional CO2 into a particular closed system is going to

10:30.460 --> 10:31.820
increase the temperature.

10:31.820 --> 10:36.260
What people don't generally understand is this idea of the multiplier, that they can't

10:36.260 --> 10:40.020
get to the catastrophic numbers that perhaps they want to get in order to get the scare

10:40.020 --> 10:41.220
money from the government.

10:41.220 --> 10:42.820
So they have this magic multiplier.

10:42.820 --> 10:46.140
OK, I think I understand the problem.

10:46.140 --> 10:51.040
Whenever someone takes a scientific fact and calls it magic, what he usually means is he

10:51.040 --> 10:53.740
doesn't understand how it works.

10:53.740 --> 10:58.500
And the part of the theory Molyneux doesn't get is what's called positive feedback.

10:58.500 --> 11:00.700
I've explained this before in my videos.

11:00.700 --> 11:06.000
A doubling of CO2 on its own would cause warming of just over one degree centigrade.

11:06.000 --> 11:10.480
And Molyneux seems to accept this, and so does his most recent guest.

11:10.480 --> 11:14.960
So one degree is not enough to worry anyone, you know, it's probably good for the earth,

11:14.960 --> 11:20.000
you know, I would like to have a little longer growing season, all my backyard garden has

11:20.000 --> 11:24.720
been killed by frost and I would have gotten a better crop this year, we'd have had a few

11:24.720 --> 11:26.200
more growing days.

11:26.200 --> 11:28.720
Well, never mind all that.

11:28.720 --> 11:33.200
So we accept the calculation of climatologists that there'll be about one degree of warming

11:33.200 --> 11:35.440
due to a doubling of CO2.

11:35.440 --> 11:39.680
And when you increase the temperature of the earth by one degree centigrade, climatologists

11:39.680 --> 11:46.020
say a few things start to happen that increase the temperature even more, what Stefan calls

11:46.020 --> 11:48.200
the magic multiplier.

11:48.200 --> 11:54.640
So let's see if it really is magic or basic physics that pretty much anyone can grasp.

11:54.640 --> 12:07.240
All you have to do is look at each of these multipliers and say whether you think it's

12:07.240 --> 12:09.960
physics or magic.

12:09.960 --> 12:11.380
Let's start with this one.

12:11.380 --> 12:15.240
As global temperatures increase, more water evaporates.

12:15.240 --> 12:16.900
Physics or magic?

12:16.900 --> 12:18.360
That one's physics.

12:18.360 --> 12:21.500
And warmer air can hold more of this water vapour.

12:21.500 --> 12:23.200
That's also physics.

12:23.200 --> 12:26.440
And water vapour is a powerful greenhouse gas.

12:26.440 --> 12:27.980
Physics.

12:27.980 --> 12:32.920
So from a one degree rise in temperature due to a doubling of CO2, the water vapour content

12:32.920 --> 12:37.280
of the atmosphere will increase, causing further warming.

12:37.280 --> 12:42.120
Those who said magic, I'm sorry, it's all very basic physics.

12:42.120 --> 12:45.160
Next positive feedback factor, albedo.

12:45.160 --> 12:49.960
White surfaces reflect solar radiation while dark surfaces absorb it.

12:49.960 --> 12:54.680
So ice, which is white, reflects most of the solar energy that falls on it, while the

12:54.680 --> 12:57.080
darker ocean absorbs it.

12:57.080 --> 12:58.080
Did you say magic?

12:58.080 --> 13:00.640
No, sorry, that's physics.

13:00.640 --> 13:05.440
So as ice melts and reveals the darker ocean underneath, the Earth reflects less solar

13:05.440 --> 13:10.280
radiation back into space and absorbs more, causing more warming.

13:10.280 --> 13:13.960
No, not magic, again, that's physics.

13:13.960 --> 13:18.720
Next, the more concerned we get about global warming, the more likely it is that the gods

13:18.720 --> 13:22.720
on Olympus will step in and make everything right again.

13:22.720 --> 13:24.280
Physics or magic?

13:24.280 --> 13:26.440
OK, that one is magic.

13:26.440 --> 13:31.240
I could add feedback factors like melting permafrost that causes the release of large

13:31.240 --> 13:36.120
quantities of methane, an even more powerful greenhouse gas than carbon dioxide.

13:36.120 --> 13:37.560
But I won't labour the point.

13:37.560 --> 13:40.600
These are all basic principles of physics.

13:40.600 --> 13:46.340
They're not magic and they're not mysteries, unless of course you don't know about them.

13:46.340 --> 13:50.680
As for the idea that these physical principles were somehow invented in order to get scare

13:50.680 --> 13:55.480
money from the government, OK, perhaps I've exaggerated what Molyneux said slightly.

13:55.480 --> 13:59.140
They can't get to the catastrophic numbers that perhaps they want to get in order to

13:59.140 --> 14:00.620
get the scare money from the government.

14:00.620 --> 14:03.040
No, he really did say that.

14:03.040 --> 14:07.480
Once again, it's a conspiracy theory that doesn't match reality.

14:07.480 --> 14:11.740
The conclusion that an increase in forcing would lead to positive feedback has been around

14:11.740 --> 14:13.160
for decades.

14:13.160 --> 14:17.320
The National Academy of Sciences described the factors involved in positive feedback

14:17.320 --> 14:19.920
as far back as 1979.

14:19.920 --> 14:25.080
Charles Keeling of the Scripps Institute wrote about them in 1969.

14:25.080 --> 14:30.720
So it was the discovery of positive feedback that led to the calculation of increased temperature,

14:30.720 --> 14:32.640
not the other way round.

14:32.640 --> 14:37.640
If Molyneux ever gets to see this video, I'd like him to clarify if he still thinks positive

14:37.640 --> 14:41.960
feedback is magic, or if he accepts that it's physics.

14:41.960 --> 14:47.920
And does he think the conspiracy to hoax us really did begin in the 1960s?

14:47.920 --> 14:52.520
Molyneux's rejection of positive feedback, the magic multiplier as he calls it, is not

14:52.520 --> 14:57.360
just because he doesn't understand how it works, it's also based on his misunderstanding

14:57.360 --> 14:59.560
of the Earth's geological history.

14:59.560 --> 15:03.200
It's kind of a common sense thing, and given that CO2 was far higher in the past than it

15:03.200 --> 15:07.400
is now, if runaway CO2 was going to happen, it would have happened a lot long before we

15:07.400 --> 15:11.080
had the chance to evolve the capacity to come up with a global warming theory.

15:11.080 --> 15:16.240
Yes, it did happen in the past, and you're simply unaware of the fact.

15:16.240 --> 15:21.080
If Molyneux had chosen to interview a paleoclimatologist, then maybe he would have been told about the

15:21.080 --> 15:26.920
periods in geological history where we had very strong warming because of rising CO2

15:26.920 --> 15:27.920
levels.

15:27.920 --> 15:32.520
There was the Cambrian hyper-warming event when carbon dioxide levels rose so much, reaching

15:32.520 --> 15:37.240
levels 20 times higher than today, that they triggered feedback processes that turned a

15:37.240 --> 15:40.060
frozen planet into a hot house.

15:40.060 --> 15:45.120
Even though the Sun was 4% weaker than today, these processes even melted the ice at the

15:45.120 --> 15:46.420
poles.

15:46.420 --> 15:50.940
To take another example, at the end of the Permian, carbon dioxide released by flood

15:50.940 --> 15:56.100
basalt warmed the Earth so much that methane hydrates on the ocean floor were released,

15:56.100 --> 16:00.900
sending temperatures even higher, because methane is another powerful greenhouse gas

16:00.900 --> 16:02.980
that breaks down to form carbon dioxide.

16:02.980 --> 16:08.180
It's another example of positive feedback, and again the Earth became a hot house and

16:08.180 --> 16:10.140
the ice caps melted.

16:10.140 --> 16:14.160
Closer to home, we've seen very strong warming at the end of each glaciation.

16:14.160 --> 16:18.320
The warming was triggered by a small increase in solar forcing, but it was the positive

16:18.320 --> 16:23.060
feedback that resulted from this that melted ice sheets the size of continents several

16:23.060 --> 16:25.340
miles deep.

16:25.340 --> 16:30.220
Whether you want to call this runaway warming, or warming that causes the ice at both poles

16:30.220 --> 16:35.940
to disappear, or even use the term that scientists use, which is hyper-warming, is entirely up

16:35.940 --> 16:37.020
to you.

16:37.020 --> 16:40.700
Whatever you want to call it, the fact remains that the average temperature of the Earth

16:40.700 --> 16:48.420
over the last 500 million years has ranged from about 10°C to 22°C, warming and cooling

16:48.420 --> 16:53.140
between these extremes not once, but several times.

16:53.140 --> 16:57.380
Now please don't pose comments like, nya nya, and this happened long before cars and

16:57.380 --> 17:02.320
humans came along, because firstly scientists have concluded that the cause of these warming

17:02.320 --> 17:05.940
and cooling events was changes in CO2 concentration.

17:05.940 --> 17:11.180
Yes, despite what the bloggers may have led you to believe, researchers have shown a very

17:11.180 --> 17:17.100
clear correlation between temperature and CO2 over the last 500 million years.

17:17.100 --> 17:22.900
The reason for the discrepancy is that bloggers conveniently leave out growing solar power.

17:22.900 --> 17:26.500
And secondly, you might accept that there were extreme ranges of temperature in the

17:26.500 --> 17:31.900
past, well done, but we're dealing in this video with Molyneux's belief, which is that

17:31.900 --> 17:34.900
global temperature has always been stable.

17:34.900 --> 17:38.260
And if you want to argue that the warming never reached the point where we became as

17:38.260 --> 17:43.340
hot as Venus, of course it didn't, for the same reason that when you leave your car in

17:43.340 --> 17:48.340
the hot sun with the windows up, it heats up, but never reaches the point where the

17:48.340 --> 17:49.620
inside melts.

17:49.620 --> 17:53.380
I've explained this physical principle before in my videos.

17:53.380 --> 17:59.580
There must be mechanisms by which any sort of big spike or change in the system is self-correcting.

17:59.580 --> 18:01.300
Why must there be?

18:01.300 --> 18:05.680
It's lovely to have dreams and hopes, but we're not living in the world of Hollywood

18:05.680 --> 18:07.220
or even magic.

18:07.220 --> 18:11.180
We're in the real world where these things actually did happen.

18:11.180 --> 18:15.980
If average global temperature rose 12 degrees centigrade in the past because of rises in

18:15.980 --> 18:21.380
carbon dioxide levels, what's this imaginary impediment to global temperatures rising around

18:21.380 --> 18:25.800
three degrees because of rising carbon dioxide levels today?

18:25.800 --> 18:30.780
The problem is Molyneux doesn't even accept that these huge climate swings happened at

18:30.780 --> 18:31.780
all.

18:31.780 --> 18:36.300
Instead, he just listens to people who have no knowledge on the subject, who simply echo

18:36.300 --> 18:37.300
his beliefs.

18:37.300 --> 18:38.420
I agree with you.

18:38.420 --> 18:43.380
There must be some kind of negative feedback that tends to keep the Earth's temperature

18:43.380 --> 18:44.380
about the same.

18:44.380 --> 18:46.620
No, it hasn't stayed about the same.

18:46.620 --> 18:48.580
Oh, never mind.

18:48.580 --> 18:54.020
Look, trying to hope that there's some sort of mechanism that must have created a condition

18:54.020 --> 18:58.660
that didn't exist is like making a wish within a dream.

18:58.660 --> 19:03.860
Stefan, why not learn about real climate science from people other than those who echo your

19:03.860 --> 19:06.220
belief that it's all a conspiracy?

19:06.220 --> 19:10.540
I'm sure it won't change your conviction that it is all a conspiracy, but at least you can

19:10.540 --> 19:15.220
now concentrate on trying to show that these conclusions are wrong instead of believing

19:15.220 --> 19:17.220
they don't exist.

19:17.220 --> 19:21.820
I hope you don't mind me being so blunt, but you did, after all, claim that this was your

19:21.820 --> 19:22.820
goal.

19:22.820 --> 19:26.340
I mean, there's nothing more boring than somebody who's only ever looked at evidence which supports

19:26.340 --> 19:27.820
his or her own conclusions.

19:27.820 --> 19:32.340
Look at the country evidence, and that will breed, I think, a very important and virtuous

19:32.340 --> 19:32.860
humility.
