1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
Here again is Pothola's first law.

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:06,000
Myths are created much faster than they can be debunked.

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:12,000
So when I received a message containing yet another triumphant proof that we don't need to be concerned about CO2,

4
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:17,000
I knew it would be at least a couple of months before I could get around to doing a video on it.

5
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:22,000
But since the story, in a blog called The Register, included a detailed source,

6
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:27,000
and since the mistakes were so obvious, I decided I had time to do a quick debunk.

7
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:29,000
First, here's the myth.

8
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:34,000
It now appears that the previous current state of climate science may simply have been wrong,

9
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:37,000
and that there's really no need to get in an immediate flap.

10
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:41,000
We can go a couple of centuries without any dangerous warming.

11
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:43,000
But who says so?

12
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:49,000
Apparently someone called Lewis Page, who, according to this bio, is an expert in military history.

13
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:54,000
So how does he know we won't experience dangerous warming for another two centuries?

14
00:00:54,000 --> 00:01:00,000
And if the climate change issue is thus resolved, why isn't this headline news all over the world?

15
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:04,000
It could be because there's a secret plot by the media to keep us from the truth.

16
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:10,000
Page cites real researchers at NASA, and a real study, and a real explanation.

17
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,000
So where does he go wrong?

18
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,000
Let's start with the study.

19
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:18,000
There are a number of things that tend to enhance global warming due to CO2.

20
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,000
This is called positive feedback.

21
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:25,000
And a number of things that tend to reduce global warming due to CO2, called negative feedback.

22
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:31,000
Among the negatives is evapotranspiration in plants, which tends to cool the air around them.

23
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:35,000
There's still a lot of uncertainty about how much evapotranspiration there'll be,

24
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:40,000
but NASA researchers made an estimate and plugged that into a model.

25
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,000
So far, no problem.

26
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:45,000
But then Page and reality part company.

27
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:49,000
He says the NASA study shows that when evapotranspiration is taken into account,

28
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:55,000
a doubling of CO2 levels would cause the Earth to warm by just 1.64 degrees.

29
00:01:55,000 --> 00:02:00,000
So he concludes that all the other models which don't take evapotranspiration into account,

30
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:03,000
and show much higher amounts of warming, are therefore wrong.

31
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:09,000
Page seems to think the study consists of just one model which includes evapotranspiration.

32
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:11,000
But it doesn't.

33
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:15,000
Researchers clearly state in their paper that they made three models.

34
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:20,000
The first was a controlled climate model that did not take evapotranspiration into account,

35
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:26,000
and it suggested that a doubling of CO2 would lead to a warming of around 1.94 degrees centigrade.

36
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:30,000
This wasn't the important part of the paper, this was just a base to work from,

37
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:37,000
because what they really wanted to find out was how much this figure rose and fell as other factors were included.

38
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:44,000
In the third model they plugged in evapotranspiration and found a warming of 1.68 degrees.

39
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:48,000
So their conclusion was, and this is what they were after,

40
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:53,000
that evapotranspiration reduced warming by 0.26 degrees centigrade.

41
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:57,000
There's nothing to suggest that the control model is any more or less correct

42
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:59,000
than all the other models that have been produced.

43
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:05,000
As the authors themselves pointed out, 1.94 degrees is at the low end of a range of results

44
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:10,000
from other computer models which vary from 2 degrees to 4.5 degrees.

45
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:15,000
If we deduct the cooling effect of evapotranspiration from the high end of the range mentioned in the paper,

46
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:19,000
we get warming of around 4.24 degrees.

47
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:25,000
So even when evapotranspiration is included, most models still project temperature increases

48
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:29,000
that are not that different and are a cause for concern.

49
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:33,000
So while Page tells us we no longer have a problem with CO2 concentrations,

50
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:38,000
the researchers who actually wrote the paper came to a completely different conclusion.

51
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:42,000
Bunoa stressed that while the model's results show a negative feedback,

52
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:47,000
it is not a strong enough response to alter the global warming trend that is expected.

53
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:52,000
This feedback slows but does not alleviate the projected warming, Bunoa said.

54
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:57,000
But that still doesn't explain why Page thought the warming would be 1.64 degrees

55
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:00,000
when the researchers said it would be 1.68.

56
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:03,000
It's a small difference, but it tells a bigger story.

57
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:09,000
It tells us that Page didn't read the paper at all. He only read NASA's press release.

58
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:13,000
Because the press release didn't include the researchers' figure of 1.68 degrees,

59
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:17,000
it gave the correct result of the control, 1.94 degrees,

60
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:24,000
but when it gave the figure for the cooling effect of evapotranspiration, it rounded it up to 0.3 degrees.

61
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:27,000
Page was obviously working with the figures from the press release

62
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:31,000
because when he subtracted one from the other, he got 1.64.

63
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:35,000
OK, so that explains the spurious temperature projection,

64
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:39,000
but what about the two centuries Page says it'll take to get there?

65
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:44,000
Page gives no source for this, but it's easy to see how he figured this out on his own.

66
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:49,000
He read in the press release that the researchers based their model on a doubling of CO2 concentration,

67
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:56,000
so he doubled today's accepted figure of 390 parts per million and came up with 780 parts per million.

68
00:04:56,000 --> 00:05:02,000
Next, he needed a growth rate for CO2 being pumped into the atmosphere, 2 parts per million per year.

69
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:08,000
Divide 390 by 2 and you get 195 years, which is roughly a couple of centuries.

70
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:13,000
No wonder people complain about the millions of dollars spent on scientific research

71
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:17,000
when all you need is five minutes and a pocket calculator.

72
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:21,000
It was beautifully worked out and wonderfully wrong.

73
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:28,000
First, Page's assertion that a doubling of CO2 meant 780 parts per million was a good guess,

74
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:36,000
but if he'd checked the paper, he would have seen that the model was based on a concentration of 700 parts per million, not 780.

75
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:41,000
That's another 310 parts per million more than today, not 390.

76
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:50,000
So at the assumed growth rate of 2 parts per million per year, it would take 155 years to reach this figure, not 195.

77
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:57,000
As for the growth rate itself, Page gives us a source, the Mauna Loa monitoring station in Hawaii.

78
00:05:57,000 --> 00:06:03,000
But this is only the current growth rate of CO2 emissions. Page assumes the growth rate won't increase

79
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:09,000
and, more importantly, that the land and oceans will continue to absorb carbon dioxide at the same rate.

80
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:15,000
Unfortunately, that absorption rate is already declining.

81
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:20,000
A 2009 study by the Massachusetts Institute of Technology found that without curbs,

82
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:28,000
CO2 concentrations are likely to reach between 716 and 1,095 parts per million by 2095,

83
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:35,000
just 85 years away, not 155 or 195.

84
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:40,000
Inevitably, Page's story was copied and pasted in blogs all over the Internet

85
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:45,000
and attracted comments from people who were so unskeptical they believed it without bothering to check

86
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:50,000
either the abstract of the paper or the accompanying news release on NASA's website.

87
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:53,000
And this one is my personal favourite.

88
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:58,000
The blogger took Page's unsourced opinion that global warming won't be a problem for another 200 years

89
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:02,000
and attributed it to scientists from NASA.

90
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:04,000
Wait, what? It's right!

91
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:09,000
Look, I understand we can't spend our days checking every bit of information that comes our way

92
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:12,000
and we may not even have the expertise to do that.

93
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:18,000
But if a piece of information makes you go, wait, what, and seems to run counter to prevailing science

94
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:23,000
and isn't being reported by the quality media, it can't hurt to check the source.

95
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:29,000
People who copy and paste this stuff on their own blogs have an even greater duty to check its veracity.

96
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:33,000
Remember, the opposite of sceptical is gullible.

97
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:38,000
But after wading through all the blunders and the bullshit, the NASA study is important.

98
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:42,000
The warming effect of carbon dioxide is well understood because it's basic physics.

99
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:47,000
Even sceptics, I mean real sceptics who are actual climate scientists,

100
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:52,000
accept that carbon dioxide causes warming and even agree on how much warming.

101
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:56,000
Where more research needs to be done is the question of sensitivity

102
00:07:56,000 --> 00:08:00,000
and that's why positive and negative feedbacks are being quantified.

103
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:05,000
The idea that evapotranspiration is one of these feedback systems is not a new one

104
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:08,000
but the question is how much of an effect will it have?

105
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:14,000
Even NASA's model may have to be revised because research that was published after NASA's model was put together

106
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:18,000
shows that evapotranspiration rates are in fact declining.

107
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:21,000
So the negative feedback may turn out to be a lot less.

108
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:27,000
It's interesting that the register chose to put a quote from Benoit at the top of the page article.

109
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:29,000
Important to get these things right.

110
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:34,000
Well, I couldn't agree more. Perhaps they should have taken that advice on board.

111
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:39,000
Every week I see claims like this that there's some new proof that climate change theory is all wrong

112
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:43,000
and that scientists are now having to abandon the theory of climate change.

113
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:49,000
Pothola's Law holds true because it only takes 15 minutes to make up a myth and post it on a blog.

114
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:54,000
But it usually takes days of painstaking work to try to track down where the myth comes from,

115
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:59,000
read the relevant research papers and write a detailed rebuttal complete with references.

116
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:04,000
In this particular case, a debunk was very easy because the source was right there

117
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:08,000
and anyone who's skeptical can see where page went wrong.

118
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:12,000
Even so, in the few hours it's taken me to put this debunk together,

119
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:16,000
someone else could have invented five new myths that have already been posted.

120
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:20,000
Inevitably, they're going to pop up faster than they can be whacked down.
