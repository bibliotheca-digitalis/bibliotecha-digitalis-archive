00:00.000 --> 00:03.000
Here again is Pothola's first law.

00:03.000 --> 00:06.000
Myths are created much faster than they can be debunked.

00:06.000 --> 00:12.000
So when I received a message containing yet another triumphant proof that we don't need to be concerned about CO2,

00:12.000 --> 00:17.000
I knew it would be at least a couple of months before I could get around to doing a video on it.

00:17.000 --> 00:22.000
But since the story, in a blog called The Register, included a detailed source,

00:22.000 --> 00:27.000
and since the mistakes were so obvious, I decided I had time to do a quick debunk.

00:27.000 --> 00:29.000
First, here's the myth.

00:29.000 --> 00:34.000
It now appears that the previous current state of climate science may simply have been wrong,

00:34.000 --> 00:37.000
and that there's really no need to get in an immediate flap.

00:37.000 --> 00:41.000
We can go a couple of centuries without any dangerous warming.

00:41.000 --> 00:43.000
But who says so?

00:43.000 --> 00:49.000
Apparently someone called Lewis Page, who, according to this bio, is an expert in military history.

00:49.000 --> 00:54.000
So how does he know we won't experience dangerous warming for another two centuries?

00:54.000 --> 01:00.000
And if the climate change issue is thus resolved, why isn't this headline news all over the world?

01:00.000 --> 01:04.000
It could be because there's a secret plot by the media to keep us from the truth.

01:04.000 --> 01:10.000
Page cites real researchers at NASA, and a real study, and a real explanation.

01:10.000 --> 01:12.000
So where does he go wrong?

01:12.000 --> 01:14.000
Let's start with the study.

01:14.000 --> 01:18.000
There are a number of things that tend to enhance global warming due to CO2.

01:18.000 --> 01:20.000
This is called positive feedback.

01:20.000 --> 01:25.000
And a number of things that tend to reduce global warming due to CO2, called negative feedback.

01:25.000 --> 01:31.000
Among the negatives is evapotranspiration in plants, which tends to cool the air around them.

01:31.000 --> 01:35.000
There's still a lot of uncertainty about how much evapotranspiration there'll be,

01:35.000 --> 01:40.000
but NASA researchers made an estimate and plugged that into a model.

01:40.000 --> 01:42.000
So far, no problem.

01:42.000 --> 01:45.000
But then Page and reality part company.

01:45.000 --> 01:49.000
He says the NASA study shows that when evapotranspiration is taken into account,

01:49.000 --> 01:55.000
a doubling of CO2 levels would cause the Earth to warm by just 1.64 degrees.

01:55.000 --> 02:00.000
So he concludes that all the other models which don't take evapotranspiration into account,

02:00.000 --> 02:03.000
and show much higher amounts of warming, are therefore wrong.

02:03.000 --> 02:09.000
Page seems to think the study consists of just one model which includes evapotranspiration.

02:09.000 --> 02:11.000
But it doesn't.

02:11.000 --> 02:15.000
Researchers clearly state in their paper that they made three models.

02:15.000 --> 02:20.000
The first was a controlled climate model that did not take evapotranspiration into account,

02:20.000 --> 02:26.000
and it suggested that a doubling of CO2 would lead to a warming of around 1.94 degrees centigrade.

02:26.000 --> 02:30.000
This wasn't the important part of the paper, this was just a base to work from,

02:30.000 --> 02:37.000
because what they really wanted to find out was how much this figure rose and fell as other factors were included.

02:37.000 --> 02:44.000
In the third model they plugged in evapotranspiration and found a warming of 1.68 degrees.

02:44.000 --> 02:48.000
So their conclusion was, and this is what they were after,

02:48.000 --> 02:53.000
that evapotranspiration reduced warming by 0.26 degrees centigrade.

02:53.000 --> 02:57.000
There's nothing to suggest that the control model is any more or less correct

02:57.000 --> 02:59.000
than all the other models that have been produced.

02:59.000 --> 03:05.000
As the authors themselves pointed out, 1.94 degrees is at the low end of a range of results

03:05.000 --> 03:10.000
from other computer models which vary from 2 degrees to 4.5 degrees.

03:10.000 --> 03:15.000
If we deduct the cooling effect of evapotranspiration from the high end of the range mentioned in the paper,

03:15.000 --> 03:19.000
we get warming of around 4.24 degrees.

03:19.000 --> 03:25.000
So even when evapotranspiration is included, most models still project temperature increases

03:25.000 --> 03:29.000
that are not that different and are a cause for concern.

03:29.000 --> 03:33.000
So while Page tells us we no longer have a problem with CO2 concentrations,

03:33.000 --> 03:38.000
the researchers who actually wrote the paper came to a completely different conclusion.

03:38.000 --> 03:42.000
Bunoa stressed that while the model's results show a negative feedback,

03:42.000 --> 03:47.000
it is not a strong enough response to alter the global warming trend that is expected.

03:47.000 --> 03:52.000
This feedback slows but does not alleviate the projected warming, Bunoa said.

03:52.000 --> 03:57.000
But that still doesn't explain why Page thought the warming would be 1.64 degrees

03:57.000 --> 04:00.000
when the researchers said it would be 1.68.

04:00.000 --> 04:03.000
It's a small difference, but it tells a bigger story.

04:03.000 --> 04:09.000
It tells us that Page didn't read the paper at all. He only read NASA's press release.

04:09.000 --> 04:13.000
Because the press release didn't include the researchers' figure of 1.68 degrees,

04:13.000 --> 04:17.000
it gave the correct result of the control, 1.94 degrees,

04:17.000 --> 04:24.000
but when it gave the figure for the cooling effect of evapotranspiration, it rounded it up to 0.3 degrees.

04:24.000 --> 04:27.000
Page was obviously working with the figures from the press release

04:27.000 --> 04:31.000
because when he subtracted one from the other, he got 1.64.

04:31.000 --> 04:35.000
OK, so that explains the spurious temperature projection,

04:35.000 --> 04:39.000
but what about the two centuries Page says it'll take to get there?

04:39.000 --> 04:44.000
Page gives no source for this, but it's easy to see how he figured this out on his own.

04:44.000 --> 04:49.000
He read in the press release that the researchers based their model on a doubling of CO2 concentration,

04:49.000 --> 04:56.000
so he doubled today's accepted figure of 390 parts per million and came up with 780 parts per million.

04:56.000 --> 05:02.000
Next, he needed a growth rate for CO2 being pumped into the atmosphere, 2 parts per million per year.

05:02.000 --> 05:08.000
Divide 390 by 2 and you get 195 years, which is roughly a couple of centuries.

05:08.000 --> 05:13.000
No wonder people complain about the millions of dollars spent on scientific research

05:13.000 --> 05:17.000
when all you need is five minutes and a pocket calculator.

05:17.000 --> 05:21.000
It was beautifully worked out and wonderfully wrong.

05:21.000 --> 05:28.000
First, Page's assertion that a doubling of CO2 meant 780 parts per million was a good guess,

05:28.000 --> 05:36.000
but if he'd checked the paper, he would have seen that the model was based on a concentration of 700 parts per million, not 780.

05:36.000 --> 05:41.000
That's another 310 parts per million more than today, not 390.

05:41.000 --> 05:50.000
So at the assumed growth rate of 2 parts per million per year, it would take 155 years to reach this figure, not 195.

05:50.000 --> 05:57.000
As for the growth rate itself, Page gives us a source, the Mauna Loa monitoring station in Hawaii.

05:57.000 --> 06:03.000
But this is only the current growth rate of CO2 emissions. Page assumes the growth rate won't increase

06:03.000 --> 06:09.000
and, more importantly, that the land and oceans will continue to absorb carbon dioxide at the same rate.

06:09.000 --> 06:15.000
Unfortunately, that absorption rate is already declining.

06:15.000 --> 06:20.000
A 2009 study by the Massachusetts Institute of Technology found that without curbs,

06:20.000 --> 06:28.000
CO2 concentrations are likely to reach between 716 and 1,095 parts per million by 2095,

06:28.000 --> 06:35.000
just 85 years away, not 155 or 195.

06:35.000 --> 06:40.000
Inevitably, Page's story was copied and pasted in blogs all over the Internet

06:40.000 --> 06:45.000
and attracted comments from people who were so unskeptical they believed it without bothering to check

06:45.000 --> 06:50.000
either the abstract of the paper or the accompanying news release on NASA's website.

06:50.000 --> 06:53.000
And this one is my personal favourite.

06:53.000 --> 06:58.000
The blogger took Page's unsourced opinion that global warming won't be a problem for another 200 years

06:58.000 --> 07:02.000
and attributed it to scientists from NASA.

07:02.000 --> 07:04.000
Wait, what? It's right!

07:04.000 --> 07:09.000
Look, I understand we can't spend our days checking every bit of information that comes our way

07:09.000 --> 07:12.000
and we may not even have the expertise to do that.

07:12.000 --> 07:18.000
But if a piece of information makes you go, wait, what, and seems to run counter to prevailing science

07:18.000 --> 07:23.000
and isn't being reported by the quality media, it can't hurt to check the source.

07:23.000 --> 07:29.000
People who copy and paste this stuff on their own blogs have an even greater duty to check its veracity.

07:29.000 --> 07:33.000
Remember, the opposite of sceptical is gullible.

07:33.000 --> 07:38.000
But after wading through all the blunders and the bullshit, the NASA study is important.

07:38.000 --> 07:42.000
The warming effect of carbon dioxide is well understood because it's basic physics.

07:42.000 --> 07:47.000
Even sceptics, I mean real sceptics who are actual climate scientists,

07:47.000 --> 07:52.000
accept that carbon dioxide causes warming and even agree on how much warming.

07:52.000 --> 07:56.000
Where more research needs to be done is the question of sensitivity

07:56.000 --> 08:00.000
and that's why positive and negative feedbacks are being quantified.

08:00.000 --> 08:05.000
The idea that evapotranspiration is one of these feedback systems is not a new one

08:05.000 --> 08:08.000
but the question is how much of an effect will it have?

08:08.000 --> 08:14.000
Even NASA's model may have to be revised because research that was published after NASA's model was put together

08:14.000 --> 08:18.000
shows that evapotranspiration rates are in fact declining.

08:18.000 --> 08:21.000
So the negative feedback may turn out to be a lot less.

08:21.000 --> 08:27.000
It's interesting that the register chose to put a quote from Benoit at the top of the page article.

08:27.000 --> 08:29.000
Important to get these things right.

08:29.000 --> 08:34.000
Well, I couldn't agree more. Perhaps they should have taken that advice on board.

08:34.000 --> 08:39.000
Every week I see claims like this that there's some new proof that climate change theory is all wrong

08:39.000 --> 08:43.000
and that scientists are now having to abandon the theory of climate change.

08:43.000 --> 08:49.000
Pothola's Law holds true because it only takes 15 minutes to make up a myth and post it on a blog.

08:49.000 --> 08:54.000
But it usually takes days of painstaking work to try to track down where the myth comes from,

08:54.000 --> 08:59.000
read the relevant research papers and write a detailed rebuttal complete with references.

09:00.000 --> 09:04.000
In this particular case, a debunk was very easy because the source was right there

09:04.000 --> 09:08.000
and anyone who's skeptical can see where page went wrong.

09:08.000 --> 09:12.000
Even so, in the few hours it's taken me to put this debunk together,

09:12.000 --> 09:16.000
someone else could have invented five new myths that have already been posted.

09:16.000 --> 09:20.000
Inevitably, they're going to pop up faster than they can be whacked down.
