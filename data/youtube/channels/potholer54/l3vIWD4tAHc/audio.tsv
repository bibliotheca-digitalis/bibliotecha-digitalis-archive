0	3000	Here again is Pothola's first law.
3000	6000	Myths are created much faster than they can be debunked.
6000	12000	So when I received a message containing yet another triumphant proof that we don't need to be concerned about CO2,
12000	17000	I knew it would be at least a couple of months before I could get around to doing a video on it.
17000	22000	But since the story, in a blog called The Register, included a detailed source,
22000	27000	and since the mistakes were so obvious, I decided I had time to do a quick debunk.
27000	29000	First, here's the myth.
29000	34000	It now appears that the previous current state of climate science may simply have been wrong,
34000	37000	and that there's really no need to get in an immediate flap.
37000	41000	We can go a couple of centuries without any dangerous warming.
41000	43000	But who says so?
43000	49000	Apparently someone called Lewis Page, who, according to this bio, is an expert in military history.
49000	54000	So how does he know we won't experience dangerous warming for another two centuries?
54000	60000	And if the climate change issue is thus resolved, why isn't this headline news all over the world?
60000	64000	It could be because there's a secret plot by the media to keep us from the truth.
64000	70000	Page cites real researchers at NASA, and a real study, and a real explanation.
70000	72000	So where does he go wrong?
72000	74000	Let's start with the study.
74000	78000	There are a number of things that tend to enhance global warming due to CO2.
78000	80000	This is called positive feedback.
80000	85000	And a number of things that tend to reduce global warming due to CO2, called negative feedback.
85000	91000	Among the negatives is evapotranspiration in plants, which tends to cool the air around them.
91000	95000	There's still a lot of uncertainty about how much evapotranspiration there'll be,
95000	100000	but NASA researchers made an estimate and plugged that into a model.
100000	102000	So far, no problem.
102000	105000	But then Page and reality part company.
105000	109000	He says the NASA study shows that when evapotranspiration is taken into account,
109000	115000	a doubling of CO2 levels would cause the Earth to warm by just 1.64 degrees.
115000	120000	So he concludes that all the other models which don't take evapotranspiration into account,
120000	123000	and show much higher amounts of warming, are therefore wrong.
123000	129000	Page seems to think the study consists of just one model which includes evapotranspiration.
129000	131000	But it doesn't.
131000	135000	Researchers clearly state in their paper that they made three models.
135000	140000	The first was a controlled climate model that did not take evapotranspiration into account,
140000	146000	and it suggested that a doubling of CO2 would lead to a warming of around 1.94 degrees centigrade.
146000	150000	This wasn't the important part of the paper, this was just a base to work from,
150000	157000	because what they really wanted to find out was how much this figure rose and fell as other factors were included.
157000	164000	In the third model they plugged in evapotranspiration and found a warming of 1.68 degrees.
164000	168000	So their conclusion was, and this is what they were after,
168000	173000	that evapotranspiration reduced warming by 0.26 degrees centigrade.
173000	177000	There's nothing to suggest that the control model is any more or less correct
177000	179000	than all the other models that have been produced.
179000	185000	As the authors themselves pointed out, 1.94 degrees is at the low end of a range of results
185000	190000	from other computer models which vary from 2 degrees to 4.5 degrees.
190000	195000	If we deduct the cooling effect of evapotranspiration from the high end of the range mentioned in the paper,
195000	199000	we get warming of around 4.24 degrees.
199000	205000	So even when evapotranspiration is included, most models still project temperature increases
205000	209000	that are not that different and are a cause for concern.
209000	213000	So while Page tells us we no longer have a problem with CO2 concentrations,
213000	218000	the researchers who actually wrote the paper came to a completely different conclusion.
218000	222000	Bunoa stressed that while the model's results show a negative feedback,
222000	227000	it is not a strong enough response to alter the global warming trend that is expected.
227000	232000	This feedback slows but does not alleviate the projected warming, Bunoa said.
232000	237000	But that still doesn't explain why Page thought the warming would be 1.64 degrees
237000	240000	when the researchers said it would be 1.68.
240000	243000	It's a small difference, but it tells a bigger story.
243000	249000	It tells us that Page didn't read the paper at all. He only read NASA's press release.
249000	253000	Because the press release didn't include the researchers' figure of 1.68 degrees,
253000	257000	it gave the correct result of the control, 1.94 degrees,
257000	264000	but when it gave the figure for the cooling effect of evapotranspiration, it rounded it up to 0.3 degrees.
264000	267000	Page was obviously working with the figures from the press release
267000	271000	because when he subtracted one from the other, he got 1.64.
271000	275000	OK, so that explains the spurious temperature projection,
275000	279000	but what about the two centuries Page says it'll take to get there?
279000	284000	Page gives no source for this, but it's easy to see how he figured this out on his own.
284000	289000	He read in the press release that the researchers based their model on a doubling of CO2 concentration,
289000	296000	so he doubled today's accepted figure of 390 parts per million and came up with 780 parts per million.
296000	302000	Next, he needed a growth rate for CO2 being pumped into the atmosphere, 2 parts per million per year.
302000	308000	Divide 390 by 2 and you get 195 years, which is roughly a couple of centuries.
308000	313000	No wonder people complain about the millions of dollars spent on scientific research
313000	317000	when all you need is five minutes and a pocket calculator.
317000	321000	It was beautifully worked out and wonderfully wrong.
321000	328000	First, Page's assertion that a doubling of CO2 meant 780 parts per million was a good guess,
328000	336000	but if he'd checked the paper, he would have seen that the model was based on a concentration of 700 parts per million, not 780.
336000	341000	That's another 310 parts per million more than today, not 390.
341000	350000	So at the assumed growth rate of 2 parts per million per year, it would take 155 years to reach this figure, not 195.
350000	357000	As for the growth rate itself, Page gives us a source, the Mauna Loa monitoring station in Hawaii.
357000	363000	But this is only the current growth rate of CO2 emissions. Page assumes the growth rate won't increase
363000	369000	and, more importantly, that the land and oceans will continue to absorb carbon dioxide at the same rate.
369000	375000	Unfortunately, that absorption rate is already declining.
375000	380000	A 2009 study by the Massachusetts Institute of Technology found that without curbs,
380000	388000	CO2 concentrations are likely to reach between 716 and 1,095 parts per million by 2095,
388000	395000	just 85 years away, not 155 or 195.
395000	400000	Inevitably, Page's story was copied and pasted in blogs all over the Internet
400000	405000	and attracted comments from people who were so unskeptical they believed it without bothering to check
405000	410000	either the abstract of the paper or the accompanying news release on NASA's website.
410000	413000	And this one is my personal favourite.
413000	418000	The blogger took Page's unsourced opinion that global warming won't be a problem for another 200 years
418000	422000	and attributed it to scientists from NASA.
422000	424000	Wait, what? It's right!
424000	429000	Look, I understand we can't spend our days checking every bit of information that comes our way
429000	432000	and we may not even have the expertise to do that.
432000	438000	But if a piece of information makes you go, wait, what, and seems to run counter to prevailing science
438000	443000	and isn't being reported by the quality media, it can't hurt to check the source.
443000	449000	People who copy and paste this stuff on their own blogs have an even greater duty to check its veracity.
449000	453000	Remember, the opposite of sceptical is gullible.
453000	458000	But after wading through all the blunders and the bullshit, the NASA study is important.
458000	462000	The warming effect of carbon dioxide is well understood because it's basic physics.
462000	467000	Even sceptics, I mean real sceptics who are actual climate scientists,
467000	472000	accept that carbon dioxide causes warming and even agree on how much warming.
472000	476000	Where more research needs to be done is the question of sensitivity
476000	480000	and that's why positive and negative feedbacks are being quantified.
480000	485000	The idea that evapotranspiration is one of these feedback systems is not a new one
485000	488000	but the question is how much of an effect will it have?
488000	494000	Even NASA's model may have to be revised because research that was published after NASA's model was put together
494000	498000	shows that evapotranspiration rates are in fact declining.
498000	501000	So the negative feedback may turn out to be a lot less.
501000	507000	It's interesting that the register chose to put a quote from Benoit at the top of the page article.
507000	509000	Important to get these things right.
509000	514000	Well, I couldn't agree more. Perhaps they should have taken that advice on board.
514000	519000	Every week I see claims like this that there's some new proof that climate change theory is all wrong
519000	523000	and that scientists are now having to abandon the theory of climate change.
523000	529000	Pothola's Law holds true because it only takes 15 minutes to make up a myth and post it on a blog.
529000	534000	But it usually takes days of painstaking work to try to track down where the myth comes from,
534000	539000	read the relevant research papers and write a detailed rebuttal complete with references.
540000	544000	In this particular case, a debunk was very easy because the source was right there
544000	548000	and anyone who's skeptical can see where page went wrong.
548000	552000	Even so, in the few hours it's taken me to put this debunk together,
552000	556000	someone else could have invented five new myths that have already been posted.
556000	560000	Inevitably, they're going to pop up faster than they can be whacked down.
