0	4160	In previous videos I've shown evidence of how the world around us was formed
4160	8160	but a fundamental question remains, how did we get here?
22160	25160	The void has always been filled by fanciful stories
25160	28840	the Chinese believed a dragon goddess needed someone to talk to
29000	32000	so she formed humans out of clay from a river bank
32000	36000	according to Jewish mythology a god made a man out of clay
36000	39000	and then fashioned a woman out of one of his ribs
39000	43000	Inuit mythology describes a raven god who filled the earth with pea pods
43000	46000	and one of these burst open to reveal the first man
46000	50000	but 150 years ago one book shattered these myths
50000	55000	and opened the door to a rational and evidence based understanding of our origins
55160	57160	But while Charles Darwin and Alfred Wallace
57160	60160	jointly came up with the idea of natural selection
60160	63160	they parted company on whether this evolutionary mechanism
63160	65160	could be applied to humans
65160	68160	Wallace formulated the idea that animals had evolved
68160	72160	but he couldn't compromise his belief that humans were the work of a deity
72160	76160	but Darwin caved to the inevitable conclusion and called it
76160	78160	My Little Heresy
78160	81160	The Little Heresy was first expounded not by Darwin
81320	83320	but by naturalist Thomas Huxley
83320	87320	in an 1863 book called Evidence as to Man's Place in Nature
87320	92320	Huxley and his supporters had clear evidence of evolution in animals
92320	97320	what they lacked was direct physical evidence to show that evolution also applied to humans
97320	101320	the search was now on for what became known as the missing link
101320	104320	a fossil that was half human, half ape
104320	108320	we are of course all apes according to classification
108480	110480	but for the purpose of simplification
110480	113480	in this video I'll refer to human apes as humans
113480	117480	and our common ancestor with chimpanzees as apes
117480	122480	It didn't take long for this new branch of science to find its first piece of evidence
122480	126480	just three years before Darwin published The Origin of Species
126480	129480	the bones of what looked like an oddly deformed human
129480	131480	were unearthed in the Neander Valley in Germany
131480	134480	Neanderthal Man wasn't the missing link
134480	137480	but it did seem to be one of our archaic ancestors
137640	141640	In 1891 fossil bones from the first real archaic hominid
141640	143640	later called Homo erectus
143640	145640	were found on Java Island
145640	149640	and 32 years later another Homo erectus skull Peking Man
149640	151640	was found in China
151640	154640	neither of these fossils were the fabled missing link
154640	156640	they were closer to humans than apes
156640	160640	but they did spark the idea that modern humans may have evolved in Asia
160640	164640	Africa was also beginning to yield some valuable finds
164800	168800	including the Taung Child found in South Africa in 1924
168800	171800	the problem was these didn't fit with another discovery
171800	175800	made 16 years earlier in southern England, Piltdown Man
175800	179800	but as more fossils emerged from South Africa in the 1930s
179800	184800	it became clear that Piltdown Man was the anomaly, not the Taung Child
184800	187800	Piltdown Man just didn't make any sense
187800	191800	either in its physiology or its geographical location
191960	195960	but it only made sense in 1953 when the hoax was revealed
195960	198960	by then the distribution of hominid fossils
198960	201960	had given rise to two schools of thought on human origins
201960	205960	an African origin and a multi-regional origin
205960	209960	the idea that humans evolved from archaic hominids in different parts of the world
209960	212960	but over the next 40 years
212960	216960	paleoanthropologists uncovered the mother lode of hominid fossils
251960	254960	the idea of a missing link
254960	258960	has long been relegated to the status of a quaint 19th century preoccupation
258960	262960	finding fossils that link humans to ancestral apes
262960	264960	isn't the problem
264960	267960	the problem is that East Africa has produced so many of them
267960	270960	that paleoanthropologists are having a hard time
270960	273960	sorting out which are our direct ancestors
273960	275960	and which are the evolutionary dead ends
275960	278960	we find what we find in most animal species
278960	280960	a wealth of relatives
281120	284120	some branched off and reached a dead end very quickly
284120	288120	others evolved for hundreds of thousands of years before becoming extinct
288120	292120	so our family tree turns out to be very rich indeed
292120	295120	it's a bit like trying to find the next of kin of an orphaned baby
295120	298120	and coming up not only with direct ancestors
298120	301120	but also their brothers, sisters, uncles and cousins
301120	305120	but together these hominid fossils tell a single story
305120	308120	as we work our way forward in time
308280	311280	just as expected, they become less ape-like
311280	313280	and more human-like
313280	316280	believers in an instant creation have a couple of explanations
316280	318280	for this wealth of fossil evidence
318280	321280	fake, fake, fake, fake
321280	323280	yeah, okay
323280	326280	I've heard that from a few conspiracy theorists
326280	330280	but even creationist organisations aren't suggesting anything so absurd
332280	334280	well, no one disputes that
334280	336280	but what species of ape?
336440	339440	there's evidence that some of these apes could light fires
339440	341440	and make tools and hunt with weapons
341440	343440	they walked on two legs
343440	345440	but they weren't human either
345440	347440	they had obvious ape characteristics
347440	349440	like arms longer than legs
349440	351440	what were they all doing in the Garden of Eden?
351440	354440	and why do we see a clear progression through time
354440	356440	of more ape-like creatures disappearing
356440	359440	and more intelligent and more human-like species
359440	361440	appearing in the sedimentary layers above
361440	364440	we never see a species disappearing
364600	367600	but we can see it by something less intelligent and less human-like
367600	370600	that might be true in some cases
370600	372600	but not in all
372600	374600	and skull shape is only one characteristic
374600	376600	that separates humans from apes
376600	378600	a more slender body form
378600	380600	larger brain size, walking on two legs
380600	382600	having opposable thumbs
382600	384600	these are all crucial human features
384600	386600	that we see evolving gradually through time
386600	388600	evolution from ape characteristics
388600	390600	to human characteristics
390600	392600	can also be found in the smallest details
392760	394760	from the shape of the pelvis
394760	396760	to the thickness of tooth enamel
396760	398760	when the field of DNA opened up
398760	400760	paleoanthropology got its first big break
400760	402760	this completely new field of science
402760	404760	would either confirm one of the mythical accounts
404760	406760	of our instant creation
406760	409760	or it would confirm the evidence of slow evolution
409760	412760	and guess which one turned out to be right?
414760	416760	or is it?
416760	418760	when geneticists investigated
418760	421760	they discovered that humans have only 46 chromosomes
421920	423920	and all the other great apes have 48
423920	425920	so we couldn't have evolved directly
425920	427920	from a common ape ancestor
427920	429920	unless
429920	431920	two of the chromosomes had fused
433920	435920	well there's only one way to find out
435920	437920	I'll let Dr Ken Miller pick up the story
437920	439920	so we can scan our genome
439920	441920	and you know what?
441920	443920	if we don't find that chromosome
443920	445920	evolution's in trouble
445920	447920	well guess what?
447920	449920	it's chromosome number two
450080	452080	it shows that our nearest relative
452080	454080	in the animal kingdom is
454080	456080	exactly as the fossil evidence predicted
456080	458080	a great ape
458080	460080	the chimpanzee
460080	462080	and when did we last share a common ancestor?
462080	464080	around 5 million years ago
464080	466080	just before the date of the first ancestral hominid fossils
468080	470080	mitochondrial DNA from a Neanderthal fossil
470080	472080	has also been analysed
472080	474080	it's completely different to every type
474080	476080	of modern human
476080	478080	and it shows that humans and Neanderthals
478240	480240	had a common ancestor around half a million years ago
482240	484240	mitochondrial DNA can only be passed
484240	486240	from mother to child
486240	488240	and it mutates at a fairly regular rate
488240	490240	let's say this woman's mitochondrial DNA
490240	492240	develops a mutation
492240	494240	and let's mark it red
494240	496240	her kids will share the same mutation
496240	498240	but only the girls will pass it on
498240	500240	several generations later
500240	502240	another part of the mitochondrial DNA mutates
502240	504240	let's give this one a blue code
504240	506240	then another one mutates
506240	508240	a green code
508240	510240	then more mutations
510240	512240	thousands of generations later we can see a clear pattern
512240	514240	closely related people share
514240	516240	a lot of similar mutation markers
516240	518240	the less closely related they are
518240	520240	the fewer common mutations they share
520240	522240	but everyone shares the red mutation
522240	524240	which means they can all be traced back
524240	526240	to a common female ancestor
526240	528240	and since geneticists know roughly the rate
528240	530240	at which these mutations occur
530240	532240	they can work out roughly when and where she lived
532240	534240	the result could be that
534240	536240	the result coincided perfectly
536240	538240	with the fossil evidence
538240	540240	around 150,000 years ago
540240	542240	in Africa
542240	544240	she wasn't the only woman around at the time
544240	546240	of course
546240	548240	and we have ancestors going much further back in time
548240	550240	but she is our most recent common ancestor
550240	552240	I've laid out the twists and turns
552240	554240	of the last 150 years
554240	556240	because science doesn't move in a straight line
556240	558240	ideas are constantly being refined
558240	560240	updated and amended
560240	562240	as more evidence comes to light
562240	564240	there are no foregone conclusions
564240	566240	and no preconceptions
566240	568240	instead we feel our way in a darkened room
568240	570240	collecting evidence
570240	572240	and getting closer and closer to an understanding
572240	574240	of the layout
574240	576240	when DNA analysis came along
576240	578240	it was as if a light had been switched on
578240	580240	almost nothing in the DNA evidence
580240	582240	contradicts what we find in the fossil evidence
582240	584240	together they give us the broad picture
584240	586240	of our origins
586240	588240	in the next video
588240	590240	the ancestry of humans made easy
590240	592240	I'll show evidence of who these ancestors were
592240	594240	and how they left their homeland
594240	596240	to conquer the world
