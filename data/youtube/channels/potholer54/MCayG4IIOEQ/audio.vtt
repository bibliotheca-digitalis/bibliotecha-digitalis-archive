00:00.000 --> 00:04.160
In previous videos I've shown evidence of how the world around us was formed

00:04.160 --> 00:08.160
but a fundamental question remains, how did we get here?

00:22.160 --> 00:25.160
The void has always been filled by fanciful stories

00:25.160 --> 00:28.840
the Chinese believed a dragon goddess needed someone to talk to

00:29.000 --> 00:32.000
so she formed humans out of clay from a river bank

00:32.000 --> 00:36.000
according to Jewish mythology a god made a man out of clay

00:36.000 --> 00:39.000
and then fashioned a woman out of one of his ribs

00:39.000 --> 00:43.000
Inuit mythology describes a raven god who filled the earth with pea pods

00:43.000 --> 00:46.000
and one of these burst open to reveal the first man

00:46.000 --> 00:50.000
but 150 years ago one book shattered these myths

00:50.000 --> 00:55.000
and opened the door to a rational and evidence based understanding of our origins

00:55.160 --> 00:57.160
But while Charles Darwin and Alfred Wallace

00:57.160 --> 01:00.160
jointly came up with the idea of natural selection

01:00.160 --> 01:03.160
they parted company on whether this evolutionary mechanism

01:03.160 --> 01:05.160
could be applied to humans

01:05.160 --> 01:08.160
Wallace formulated the idea that animals had evolved

01:08.160 --> 01:12.160
but he couldn't compromise his belief that humans were the work of a deity

01:12.160 --> 01:16.160
but Darwin caved to the inevitable conclusion and called it

01:16.160 --> 01:18.160
My Little Heresy

01:18.160 --> 01:21.160
The Little Heresy was first expounded not by Darwin

01:21.320 --> 01:23.320
but by naturalist Thomas Huxley

01:23.320 --> 01:27.320
in an 1863 book called Evidence as to Man's Place in Nature

01:27.320 --> 01:32.320
Huxley and his supporters had clear evidence of evolution in animals

01:32.320 --> 01:37.320
what they lacked was direct physical evidence to show that evolution also applied to humans

01:37.320 --> 01:41.320
the search was now on for what became known as the missing link

01:41.320 --> 01:44.320
a fossil that was half human, half ape

01:44.320 --> 01:48.320
we are of course all apes according to classification

01:48.480 --> 01:50.480
but for the purpose of simplification

01:50.480 --> 01:53.480
in this video I'll refer to human apes as humans

01:53.480 --> 01:57.480
and our common ancestor with chimpanzees as apes

01:57.480 --> 02:02.480
It didn't take long for this new branch of science to find its first piece of evidence

02:02.480 --> 02:06.480
just three years before Darwin published The Origin of Species

02:06.480 --> 02:09.480
the bones of what looked like an oddly deformed human

02:09.480 --> 02:11.480
were unearthed in the Neander Valley in Germany

02:11.480 --> 02:14.480
Neanderthal Man wasn't the missing link

02:14.480 --> 02:17.480
but it did seem to be one of our archaic ancestors

02:17.640 --> 02:21.640
In 1891 fossil bones from the first real archaic hominid

02:21.640 --> 02:23.640
later called Homo erectus

02:23.640 --> 02:25.640
were found on Java Island

02:25.640 --> 02:29.640
and 32 years later another Homo erectus skull Peking Man

02:29.640 --> 02:31.640
was found in China

02:31.640 --> 02:34.640
neither of these fossils were the fabled missing link

02:34.640 --> 02:36.640
they were closer to humans than apes

02:36.640 --> 02:40.640
but they did spark the idea that modern humans may have evolved in Asia

02:40.640 --> 02:44.640
Africa was also beginning to yield some valuable finds

02:44.800 --> 02:48.800
including the Taung Child found in South Africa in 1924

02:48.800 --> 02:51.800
the problem was these didn't fit with another discovery

02:51.800 --> 02:55.800
made 16 years earlier in southern England, Piltdown Man

02:55.800 --> 02:59.800
but as more fossils emerged from South Africa in the 1930s

02:59.800 --> 03:04.800
it became clear that Piltdown Man was the anomaly, not the Taung Child

03:04.800 --> 03:07.800
Piltdown Man just didn't make any sense

03:07.800 --> 03:11.800
either in its physiology or its geographical location

03:11.960 --> 03:15.960
but it only made sense in 1953 when the hoax was revealed

03:15.960 --> 03:18.960
by then the distribution of hominid fossils

03:18.960 --> 03:21.960
had given rise to two schools of thought on human origins

03:21.960 --> 03:25.960
an African origin and a multi-regional origin

03:25.960 --> 03:29.960
the idea that humans evolved from archaic hominids in different parts of the world

03:29.960 --> 03:32.960
but over the next 40 years

03:32.960 --> 03:36.960
paleoanthropologists uncovered the mother lode of hominid fossils

04:11.960 --> 04:14.960
the idea of a missing link

04:14.960 --> 04:18.960
has long been relegated to the status of a quaint 19th century preoccupation

04:18.960 --> 04:22.960
finding fossils that link humans to ancestral apes

04:22.960 --> 04:24.960
isn't the problem

04:24.960 --> 04:27.960
the problem is that East Africa has produced so many of them

04:27.960 --> 04:30.960
that paleoanthropologists are having a hard time

04:30.960 --> 04:33.960
sorting out which are our direct ancestors

04:33.960 --> 04:35.960
and which are the evolutionary dead ends

04:35.960 --> 04:38.960
we find what we find in most animal species

04:38.960 --> 04:40.960
a wealth of relatives

04:41.120 --> 04:44.120
some branched off and reached a dead end very quickly

04:44.120 --> 04:48.120
others evolved for hundreds of thousands of years before becoming extinct

04:48.120 --> 04:52.120
so our family tree turns out to be very rich indeed

04:52.120 --> 04:55.120
it's a bit like trying to find the next of kin of an orphaned baby

04:55.120 --> 04:58.120
and coming up not only with direct ancestors

04:58.120 --> 05:01.120
but also their brothers, sisters, uncles and cousins

05:01.120 --> 05:05.120
but together these hominid fossils tell a single story

05:05.120 --> 05:08.120
as we work our way forward in time

05:08.280 --> 05:11.280
just as expected, they become less ape-like

05:11.280 --> 05:13.280
and more human-like

05:13.280 --> 05:16.280
believers in an instant creation have a couple of explanations

05:16.280 --> 05:18.280
for this wealth of fossil evidence

05:18.280 --> 05:21.280
fake, fake, fake, fake

05:21.280 --> 05:23.280
yeah, okay

05:23.280 --> 05:26.280
I've heard that from a few conspiracy theorists

05:26.280 --> 05:30.280
but even creationist organisations aren't suggesting anything so absurd

05:32.280 --> 05:34.280
well, no one disputes that

05:34.280 --> 05:36.280
but what species of ape?

05:36.440 --> 05:39.440
there's evidence that some of these apes could light fires

05:39.440 --> 05:41.440
and make tools and hunt with weapons

05:41.440 --> 05:43.440
they walked on two legs

05:43.440 --> 05:45.440
but they weren't human either

05:45.440 --> 05:47.440
they had obvious ape characteristics

05:47.440 --> 05:49.440
like arms longer than legs

05:49.440 --> 05:51.440
what were they all doing in the Garden of Eden?

05:51.440 --> 05:54.440
and why do we see a clear progression through time

05:54.440 --> 05:56.440
of more ape-like creatures disappearing

05:56.440 --> 05:59.440
and more intelligent and more human-like species

05:59.440 --> 06:01.440
appearing in the sedimentary layers above

06:01.440 --> 06:04.440
we never see a species disappearing

06:04.600 --> 06:07.600
but we can see it by something less intelligent and less human-like

06:07.600 --> 06:10.600
that might be true in some cases

06:10.600 --> 06:12.600
but not in all

06:12.600 --> 06:14.600
and skull shape is only one characteristic

06:14.600 --> 06:16.600
that separates humans from apes

06:16.600 --> 06:18.600
a more slender body form

06:18.600 --> 06:20.600
larger brain size, walking on two legs

06:20.600 --> 06:22.600
having opposable thumbs

06:22.600 --> 06:24.600
these are all crucial human features

06:24.600 --> 06:26.600
that we see evolving gradually through time

06:26.600 --> 06:28.600
evolution from ape characteristics

06:28.600 --> 06:30.600
to human characteristics

06:30.600 --> 06:32.600
can also be found in the smallest details

06:32.760 --> 06:34.760
from the shape of the pelvis

06:34.760 --> 06:36.760
to the thickness of tooth enamel

06:36.760 --> 06:38.760
when the field of DNA opened up

06:38.760 --> 06:40.760
paleoanthropology got its first big break

06:40.760 --> 06:42.760
this completely new field of science

06:42.760 --> 06:44.760
would either confirm one of the mythical accounts

06:44.760 --> 06:46.760
of our instant creation

06:46.760 --> 06:49.760
or it would confirm the evidence of slow evolution

06:49.760 --> 06:52.760
and guess which one turned out to be right?

06:54.760 --> 06:56.760
or is it?

06:56.760 --> 06:58.760
when geneticists investigated

06:58.760 --> 07:01.760
they discovered that humans have only 46 chromosomes

07:01.920 --> 07:03.920
and all the other great apes have 48

07:03.920 --> 07:05.920
so we couldn't have evolved directly

07:05.920 --> 07:07.920
from a common ape ancestor

07:07.920 --> 07:09.920
unless

07:09.920 --> 07:11.920
two of the chromosomes had fused

07:13.920 --> 07:15.920
well there's only one way to find out

07:15.920 --> 07:17.920
I'll let Dr Ken Miller pick up the story

07:17.920 --> 07:19.920
so we can scan our genome

07:19.920 --> 07:21.920
and you know what?

07:21.920 --> 07:23.920
if we don't find that chromosome

07:23.920 --> 07:25.920
evolution's in trouble

07:25.920 --> 07:27.920
well guess what?

07:27.920 --> 07:29.920
it's chromosome number two

07:30.080 --> 07:32.080
it shows that our nearest relative

07:32.080 --> 07:34.080
in the animal kingdom is

07:34.080 --> 07:36.080
exactly as the fossil evidence predicted

07:36.080 --> 07:38.080
a great ape

07:38.080 --> 07:40.080
the chimpanzee

07:40.080 --> 07:42.080
and when did we last share a common ancestor?

07:42.080 --> 07:44.080
around 5 million years ago

07:44.080 --> 07:46.080
just before the date of the first ancestral hominid fossils

07:48.080 --> 07:50.080
mitochondrial DNA from a Neanderthal fossil

07:50.080 --> 07:52.080
has also been analysed

07:52.080 --> 07:54.080
it's completely different to every type

07:54.080 --> 07:56.080
of modern human

07:56.080 --> 07:58.080
and it shows that humans and Neanderthals

07:58.240 --> 08:00.240
had a common ancestor around half a million years ago

08:02.240 --> 08:04.240
mitochondrial DNA can only be passed

08:04.240 --> 08:06.240
from mother to child

08:06.240 --> 08:08.240
and it mutates at a fairly regular rate

08:08.240 --> 08:10.240
let's say this woman's mitochondrial DNA

08:10.240 --> 08:12.240
develops a mutation

08:12.240 --> 08:14.240
and let's mark it red

08:14.240 --> 08:16.240
her kids will share the same mutation

08:16.240 --> 08:18.240
but only the girls will pass it on

08:18.240 --> 08:20.240
several generations later

08:20.240 --> 08:22.240
another part of the mitochondrial DNA mutates

08:22.240 --> 08:24.240
let's give this one a blue code

08:24.240 --> 08:26.240
then another one mutates

08:26.240 --> 08:28.240
a green code

08:28.240 --> 08:30.240
then more mutations

08:30.240 --> 08:32.240
thousands of generations later we can see a clear pattern

08:32.240 --> 08:34.240
closely related people share

08:34.240 --> 08:36.240
a lot of similar mutation markers

08:36.240 --> 08:38.240
the less closely related they are

08:38.240 --> 08:40.240
the fewer common mutations they share

08:40.240 --> 08:42.240
but everyone shares the red mutation

08:42.240 --> 08:44.240
which means they can all be traced back

08:44.240 --> 08:46.240
to a common female ancestor

08:46.240 --> 08:48.240
and since geneticists know roughly the rate

08:48.240 --> 08:50.240
at which these mutations occur

08:50.240 --> 08:52.240
they can work out roughly when and where she lived

08:52.240 --> 08:54.240
the result could be that

08:54.240 --> 08:56.240
the result coincided perfectly

08:56.240 --> 08:58.240
with the fossil evidence

08:58.240 --> 09:00.240
around 150,000 years ago

09:00.240 --> 09:02.240
in Africa

09:02.240 --> 09:04.240
she wasn't the only woman around at the time

09:04.240 --> 09:06.240
of course

09:06.240 --> 09:08.240
and we have ancestors going much further back in time

09:08.240 --> 09:10.240
but she is our most recent common ancestor

09:10.240 --> 09:12.240
I've laid out the twists and turns

09:12.240 --> 09:14.240
of the last 150 years

09:14.240 --> 09:16.240
because science doesn't move in a straight line

09:16.240 --> 09:18.240
ideas are constantly being refined

09:18.240 --> 09:20.240
updated and amended

09:20.240 --> 09:22.240
as more evidence comes to light

09:22.240 --> 09:24.240
there are no foregone conclusions

09:24.240 --> 09:26.240
and no preconceptions

09:26.240 --> 09:28.240
instead we feel our way in a darkened room

09:28.240 --> 09:30.240
collecting evidence

09:30.240 --> 09:32.240
and getting closer and closer to an understanding

09:32.240 --> 09:34.240
of the layout

09:34.240 --> 09:36.240
when DNA analysis came along

09:36.240 --> 09:38.240
it was as if a light had been switched on

09:38.240 --> 09:40.240
almost nothing in the DNA evidence

09:40.240 --> 09:42.240
contradicts what we find in the fossil evidence

09:42.240 --> 09:44.240
together they give us the broad picture

09:44.240 --> 09:46.240
of our origins

09:46.240 --> 09:48.240
in the next video

09:48.240 --> 09:50.240
the ancestry of humans made easy

09:50.240 --> 09:52.240
I'll show evidence of who these ancestors were

09:52.240 --> 09:54.240
and how they left their homeland

09:54.240 --> 09:56.240
to conquer the world
