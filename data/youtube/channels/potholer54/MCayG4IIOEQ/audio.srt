1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,160
In previous videos I've shown evidence of how the world around us was formed

2
00:00:04,160 --> 00:00:08,160
but a fundamental question remains, how did we get here?

3
00:00:22,160 --> 00:00:25,160
The void has always been filled by fanciful stories

4
00:00:25,160 --> 00:00:28,840
the Chinese believed a dragon goddess needed someone to talk to

5
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:32,000
so she formed humans out of clay from a river bank

6
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:36,000
according to Jewish mythology a god made a man out of clay

7
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:39,000
and then fashioned a woman out of one of his ribs

8
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:43,000
Inuit mythology describes a raven god who filled the earth with pea pods

9
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:46,000
and one of these burst open to reveal the first man

10
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:50,000
but 150 years ago one book shattered these myths

11
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:55,000
and opened the door to a rational and evidence based understanding of our origins

12
00:00:55,160 --> 00:00:57,160
But while Charles Darwin and Alfred Wallace

13
00:00:57,160 --> 00:01:00,160
jointly came up with the idea of natural selection

14
00:01:00,160 --> 00:01:03,160
they parted company on whether this evolutionary mechanism

15
00:01:03,160 --> 00:01:05,160
could be applied to humans

16
00:01:05,160 --> 00:01:08,160
Wallace formulated the idea that animals had evolved

17
00:01:08,160 --> 00:01:12,160
but he couldn't compromise his belief that humans were the work of a deity

18
00:01:12,160 --> 00:01:16,160
but Darwin caved to the inevitable conclusion and called it

19
00:01:16,160 --> 00:01:18,160
My Little Heresy

20
00:01:18,160 --> 00:01:21,160
The Little Heresy was first expounded not by Darwin

21
00:01:21,320 --> 00:01:23,320
but by naturalist Thomas Huxley

22
00:01:23,320 --> 00:01:27,320
in an 1863 book called Evidence as to Man's Place in Nature

23
00:01:27,320 --> 00:01:32,320
Huxley and his supporters had clear evidence of evolution in animals

24
00:01:32,320 --> 00:01:37,320
what they lacked was direct physical evidence to show that evolution also applied to humans

25
00:01:37,320 --> 00:01:41,320
the search was now on for what became known as the missing link

26
00:01:41,320 --> 00:01:44,320
a fossil that was half human, half ape

27
00:01:44,320 --> 00:01:48,320
we are of course all apes according to classification

28
00:01:48,480 --> 00:01:50,480
but for the purpose of simplification

29
00:01:50,480 --> 00:01:53,480
in this video I'll refer to human apes as humans

30
00:01:53,480 --> 00:01:57,480
and our common ancestor with chimpanzees as apes

31
00:01:57,480 --> 00:02:02,480
It didn't take long for this new branch of science to find its first piece of evidence

32
00:02:02,480 --> 00:02:06,480
just three years before Darwin published The Origin of Species

33
00:02:06,480 --> 00:02:09,480
the bones of what looked like an oddly deformed human

34
00:02:09,480 --> 00:02:11,480
were unearthed in the Neander Valley in Germany

35
00:02:11,480 --> 00:02:14,480
Neanderthal Man wasn't the missing link

36
00:02:14,480 --> 00:02:17,480
but it did seem to be one of our archaic ancestors

37
00:02:17,640 --> 00:02:21,640
In 1891 fossil bones from the first real archaic hominid

38
00:02:21,640 --> 00:02:23,640
later called Homo erectus

39
00:02:23,640 --> 00:02:25,640
were found on Java Island

40
00:02:25,640 --> 00:02:29,640
and 32 years later another Homo erectus skull Peking Man

41
00:02:29,640 --> 00:02:31,640
was found in China

42
00:02:31,640 --> 00:02:34,640
neither of these fossils were the fabled missing link

43
00:02:34,640 --> 00:02:36,640
they were closer to humans than apes

44
00:02:36,640 --> 00:02:40,640
but they did spark the idea that modern humans may have evolved in Asia

45
00:02:40,640 --> 00:02:44,640
Africa was also beginning to yield some valuable finds

46
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:48,800
including the Taung Child found in South Africa in 1924

47
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:51,800
the problem was these didn't fit with another discovery

48
00:02:51,800 --> 00:02:55,800
made 16 years earlier in southern England, Piltdown Man

49
00:02:55,800 --> 00:02:59,800
but as more fossils emerged from South Africa in the 1930s

50
00:02:59,800 --> 00:03:04,800
it became clear that Piltdown Man was the anomaly, not the Taung Child

51
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:07,800
Piltdown Man just didn't make any sense

52
00:03:07,800 --> 00:03:11,800
either in its physiology or its geographical location

53
00:03:11,960 --> 00:03:15,960
but it only made sense in 1953 when the hoax was revealed

54
00:03:15,960 --> 00:03:18,960
by then the distribution of hominid fossils

55
00:03:18,960 --> 00:03:21,960
had given rise to two schools of thought on human origins

56
00:03:21,960 --> 00:03:25,960
an African origin and a multi-regional origin

57
00:03:25,960 --> 00:03:29,960
the idea that humans evolved from archaic hominids in different parts of the world

58
00:03:29,960 --> 00:03:32,960
but over the next 40 years

59
00:03:32,960 --> 00:03:36,960
paleoanthropologists uncovered the mother lode of hominid fossils

60
00:04:11,960 --> 00:04:14,960
the idea of a missing link

61
00:04:14,960 --> 00:04:18,960
has long been relegated to the status of a quaint 19th century preoccupation

62
00:04:18,960 --> 00:04:22,960
finding fossils that link humans to ancestral apes

63
00:04:22,960 --> 00:04:24,960
isn't the problem

64
00:04:24,960 --> 00:04:27,960
the problem is that East Africa has produced so many of them

65
00:04:27,960 --> 00:04:30,960
that paleoanthropologists are having a hard time

66
00:04:30,960 --> 00:04:33,960
sorting out which are our direct ancestors

67
00:04:33,960 --> 00:04:35,960
and which are the evolutionary dead ends

68
00:04:35,960 --> 00:04:38,960
we find what we find in most animal species

69
00:04:38,960 --> 00:04:40,960
a wealth of relatives

70
00:04:41,120 --> 00:04:44,120
some branched off and reached a dead end very quickly

71
00:04:44,120 --> 00:04:48,120
others evolved for hundreds of thousands of years before becoming extinct

72
00:04:48,120 --> 00:04:52,120
so our family tree turns out to be very rich indeed

73
00:04:52,120 --> 00:04:55,120
it's a bit like trying to find the next of kin of an orphaned baby

74
00:04:55,120 --> 00:04:58,120
and coming up not only with direct ancestors

75
00:04:58,120 --> 00:05:01,120
but also their brothers, sisters, uncles and cousins

76
00:05:01,120 --> 00:05:05,120
but together these hominid fossils tell a single story

77
00:05:05,120 --> 00:05:08,120
as we work our way forward in time

78
00:05:08,280 --> 00:05:11,280
just as expected, they become less ape-like

79
00:05:11,280 --> 00:05:13,280
and more human-like

80
00:05:13,280 --> 00:05:16,280
believers in an instant creation have a couple of explanations

81
00:05:16,280 --> 00:05:18,280
for this wealth of fossil evidence

82
00:05:18,280 --> 00:05:21,280
fake, fake, fake, fake

83
00:05:21,280 --> 00:05:23,280
yeah, okay

84
00:05:23,280 --> 00:05:26,280
I've heard that from a few conspiracy theorists

85
00:05:26,280 --> 00:05:30,280
but even creationist organisations aren't suggesting anything so absurd

86
00:05:32,280 --> 00:05:34,280
well, no one disputes that

87
00:05:34,280 --> 00:05:36,280
but what species of ape?

88
00:05:36,440 --> 00:05:39,440
there's evidence that some of these apes could light fires

89
00:05:39,440 --> 00:05:41,440
and make tools and hunt with weapons

90
00:05:41,440 --> 00:05:43,440
they walked on two legs

91
00:05:43,440 --> 00:05:45,440
but they weren't human either

92
00:05:45,440 --> 00:05:47,440
they had obvious ape characteristics

93
00:05:47,440 --> 00:05:49,440
like arms longer than legs

94
00:05:49,440 --> 00:05:51,440
what were they all doing in the Garden of Eden?

95
00:05:51,440 --> 00:05:54,440
and why do we see a clear progression through time

96
00:05:54,440 --> 00:05:56,440
of more ape-like creatures disappearing

97
00:05:56,440 --> 00:05:59,440
and more intelligent and more human-like species

98
00:05:59,440 --> 00:06:01,440
appearing in the sedimentary layers above

99
00:06:01,440 --> 00:06:04,440
we never see a species disappearing

100
00:06:04,600 --> 00:06:07,600
but we can see it by something less intelligent and less human-like

101
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:10,600
that might be true in some cases

102
00:06:10,600 --> 00:06:12,600
but not in all

103
00:06:12,600 --> 00:06:14,600
and skull shape is only one characteristic

104
00:06:14,600 --> 00:06:16,600
that separates humans from apes

105
00:06:16,600 --> 00:06:18,600
a more slender body form

106
00:06:18,600 --> 00:06:20,600
larger brain size, walking on two legs

107
00:06:20,600 --> 00:06:22,600
having opposable thumbs

108
00:06:22,600 --> 00:06:24,600
these are all crucial human features

109
00:06:24,600 --> 00:06:26,600
that we see evolving gradually through time

110
00:06:26,600 --> 00:06:28,600
evolution from ape characteristics

111
00:06:28,600 --> 00:06:30,600
to human characteristics

112
00:06:30,600 --> 00:06:32,600
can also be found in the smallest details

113
00:06:32,760 --> 00:06:34,760
from the shape of the pelvis

114
00:06:34,760 --> 00:06:36,760
to the thickness of tooth enamel

115
00:06:36,760 --> 00:06:38,760
when the field of DNA opened up

116
00:06:38,760 --> 00:06:40,760
paleoanthropology got its first big break

117
00:06:40,760 --> 00:06:42,760
this completely new field of science

118
00:06:42,760 --> 00:06:44,760
would either confirm one of the mythical accounts

119
00:06:44,760 --> 00:06:46,760
of our instant creation

120
00:06:46,760 --> 00:06:49,760
or it would confirm the evidence of slow evolution

121
00:06:49,760 --> 00:06:52,760
and guess which one turned out to be right?

122
00:06:54,760 --> 00:06:56,760
or is it?

123
00:06:56,760 --> 00:06:58,760
when geneticists investigated

124
00:06:58,760 --> 00:07:01,760
they discovered that humans have only 46 chromosomes

125
00:07:01,920 --> 00:07:03,920
and all the other great apes have 48

126
00:07:03,920 --> 00:07:05,920
so we couldn't have evolved directly

127
00:07:05,920 --> 00:07:07,920
from a common ape ancestor

128
00:07:07,920 --> 00:07:09,920
unless

129
00:07:09,920 --> 00:07:11,920
two of the chromosomes had fused

130
00:07:13,920 --> 00:07:15,920
well there's only one way to find out

131
00:07:15,920 --> 00:07:17,920
I'll let Dr Ken Miller pick up the story

132
00:07:17,920 --> 00:07:19,920
so we can scan our genome

133
00:07:19,920 --> 00:07:21,920
and you know what?

134
00:07:21,920 --> 00:07:23,920
if we don't find that chromosome

135
00:07:23,920 --> 00:07:25,920
evolution's in trouble

136
00:07:25,920 --> 00:07:27,920
well guess what?

137
00:07:27,920 --> 00:07:29,920
it's chromosome number two

138
00:07:30,080 --> 00:07:32,080
it shows that our nearest relative

139
00:07:32,080 --> 00:07:34,080
in the animal kingdom is

140
00:07:34,080 --> 00:07:36,080
exactly as the fossil evidence predicted

141
00:07:36,080 --> 00:07:38,080
a great ape

142
00:07:38,080 --> 00:07:40,080
the chimpanzee

143
00:07:40,080 --> 00:07:42,080
and when did we last share a common ancestor?

144
00:07:42,080 --> 00:07:44,080
around 5 million years ago

145
00:07:44,080 --> 00:07:46,080
just before the date of the first ancestral hominid fossils

146
00:07:48,080 --> 00:07:50,080
mitochondrial DNA from a Neanderthal fossil

147
00:07:50,080 --> 00:07:52,080
has also been analysed

148
00:07:52,080 --> 00:07:54,080
it's completely different to every type

149
00:07:54,080 --> 00:07:56,080
of modern human

150
00:07:56,080 --> 00:07:58,080
and it shows that humans and Neanderthals

151
00:07:58,240 --> 00:08:00,240
had a common ancestor around half a million years ago

152
00:08:02,240 --> 00:08:04,240
mitochondrial DNA can only be passed

153
00:08:04,240 --> 00:08:06,240
from mother to child

154
00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:08,240
and it mutates at a fairly regular rate

155
00:08:08,240 --> 00:08:10,240
let's say this woman's mitochondrial DNA

156
00:08:10,240 --> 00:08:12,240
develops a mutation

157
00:08:12,240 --> 00:08:14,240
and let's mark it red

158
00:08:14,240 --> 00:08:16,240
her kids will share the same mutation

159
00:08:16,240 --> 00:08:18,240
but only the girls will pass it on

160
00:08:18,240 --> 00:08:20,240
several generations later

161
00:08:20,240 --> 00:08:22,240
another part of the mitochondrial DNA mutates

162
00:08:22,240 --> 00:08:24,240
let's give this one a blue code

163
00:08:24,240 --> 00:08:26,240
then another one mutates

164
00:08:26,240 --> 00:08:28,240
a green code

165
00:08:28,240 --> 00:08:30,240
then more mutations

166
00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:32,240
thousands of generations later we can see a clear pattern

167
00:08:32,240 --> 00:08:34,240
closely related people share

168
00:08:34,240 --> 00:08:36,240
a lot of similar mutation markers

169
00:08:36,240 --> 00:08:38,240
the less closely related they are

170
00:08:38,240 --> 00:08:40,240
the fewer common mutations they share

171
00:08:40,240 --> 00:08:42,240
but everyone shares the red mutation

172
00:08:42,240 --> 00:08:44,240
which means they can all be traced back

173
00:08:44,240 --> 00:08:46,240
to a common female ancestor

174
00:08:46,240 --> 00:08:48,240
and since geneticists know roughly the rate

175
00:08:48,240 --> 00:08:50,240
at which these mutations occur

176
00:08:50,240 --> 00:08:52,240
they can work out roughly when and where she lived

177
00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:54,240
the result could be that

178
00:08:54,240 --> 00:08:56,240
the result coincided perfectly

179
00:08:56,240 --> 00:08:58,240
with the fossil evidence

180
00:08:58,240 --> 00:09:00,240
around 150,000 years ago

181
00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:02,240
in Africa

182
00:09:02,240 --> 00:09:04,240
she wasn't the only woman around at the time

183
00:09:04,240 --> 00:09:06,240
of course

184
00:09:06,240 --> 00:09:08,240
and we have ancestors going much further back in time

185
00:09:08,240 --> 00:09:10,240
but she is our most recent common ancestor

186
00:09:10,240 --> 00:09:12,240
I've laid out the twists and turns

187
00:09:12,240 --> 00:09:14,240
of the last 150 years

188
00:09:14,240 --> 00:09:16,240
because science doesn't move in a straight line

189
00:09:16,240 --> 00:09:18,240
ideas are constantly being refined

190
00:09:18,240 --> 00:09:20,240
updated and amended

191
00:09:20,240 --> 00:09:22,240
as more evidence comes to light

192
00:09:22,240 --> 00:09:24,240
there are no foregone conclusions

193
00:09:24,240 --> 00:09:26,240
and no preconceptions

194
00:09:26,240 --> 00:09:28,240
instead we feel our way in a darkened room

195
00:09:28,240 --> 00:09:30,240
collecting evidence

196
00:09:30,240 --> 00:09:32,240
and getting closer and closer to an understanding

197
00:09:32,240 --> 00:09:34,240
of the layout

198
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:36,240
when DNA analysis came along

199
00:09:36,240 --> 00:09:38,240
it was as if a light had been switched on

200
00:09:38,240 --> 00:09:40,240
almost nothing in the DNA evidence

201
00:09:40,240 --> 00:09:42,240
contradicts what we find in the fossil evidence

202
00:09:42,240 --> 00:09:44,240
together they give us the broad picture

203
00:09:44,240 --> 00:09:46,240
of our origins

204
00:09:46,240 --> 00:09:48,240
in the next video

205
00:09:48,240 --> 00:09:50,240
the ancestry of humans made easy

206
00:09:50,240 --> 00:09:52,240
I'll show evidence of who these ancestors were

207
00:09:52,240 --> 00:09:54,240
and how they left their homeland

208
00:09:54,240 --> 00:09:56,240
to conquer the world
