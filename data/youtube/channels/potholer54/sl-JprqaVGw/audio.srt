Join us in our search for truth.

4
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:15,500
The Creation Adventure team is headed by a previous Golden Crocoduck nominee, Buddy Davis.

5
00:00:15,500 --> 00:00:20,000
Well, now he's brought us something disturbing and at the same time hilarious

6
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:25,000
in an attempt to wean kids off science at an early age and get them hooked on religion.

7
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:29,500
Together with Brad Stein, Phil Snyder, Andy Hosmer and Kathy Henderson,

8
00:00:29,500 --> 00:00:35,500
Buddy tells the children that dinosaurs were fun, cuddly animals that only died out a few thousand years ago.

9
00:00:39,500 --> 00:00:44,500
The plot of this rather confusing story is that a TV reporter goes to talk to a scientist

10
00:00:44,500 --> 00:00:47,500
about what happened to the dinosaurs.

11
00:00:47,500 --> 00:00:52,500
But his explanations are so bad, she goes on some kind of a hallucinogenic trip

12
00:00:52,500 --> 00:00:59,500
and ends up thinking the dinosaurs popped into existence in a couple of days.

13
00:00:59,500 --> 00:01:04,500
Meanwhile, Buddy is outdoors explaining to the kids the real story of what happened to the dinosaurs

14
00:01:04,500 --> 00:01:07,500
with the help of a hyperactive teenager

15
00:01:10,500 --> 00:01:13,500
and a dinosaur in a George Washington fright wig.

16
00:01:13,500 --> 00:01:16,500
Bones in the present! In the present!

17
00:01:16,500 --> 00:01:22,500
The video starts with an apparent mystery. Sorry, apparent mystery, apparent mystery.

18
00:01:22,500 --> 00:01:28,500
There doesn't seem to be a clear understanding by science as to what happened to the dinosaurs.

19
00:01:28,500 --> 00:01:30,500
Actually, there's a very good understanding.

20
00:01:30,500 --> 00:01:35,500
We can tell from the fossil record that dinosaur numbers were falling away in the late Cretaceous,

21
00:01:35,500 --> 00:01:39,500
probably because of the release of sulphur dioxide from the Deccan Traps,

22
00:01:39,500 --> 00:01:42,500
a huge outflow of lava in what's now India.

23
00:01:42,500 --> 00:01:46,500
Most of the dinosaurs that survived were then wiped out by an asteroid,

24
00:01:46,500 --> 00:01:49,500
and there's a very clear record of that too.

25
00:01:49,500 --> 00:01:54,500
But some small dinosaurs survived even that and evolved into modern birds.

26
00:01:54,500 --> 00:01:57,500
Surely the resident scientist can explain this.

27
00:01:57,500 --> 00:02:04,500
The dinosaur's survival instinct actually caused some of them to evolve feathers so they could fly.

28
00:02:04,500 --> 00:02:06,500
Hmm, nice try.

29
00:02:06,500 --> 00:02:09,500
What this shows is that a creationist can pretend to be a scientist,

30
00:02:09,500 --> 00:02:12,500
but it still doesn't help him understand science.

31
00:02:12,500 --> 00:02:17,500
Firstly, it's not the survival instinct that causes evolution, it's natural selection.

32
00:02:17,500 --> 00:02:22,500
If you don't know how that works, check out my video Natural Selection Made Easy.

33
00:02:22,500 --> 00:02:26,500
Secondly, dinosaurs didn't evolve feathers so they could fly.

34
00:02:26,500 --> 00:02:29,500
No animal consciously causes a body part to evolve.

35
00:02:29,500 --> 00:02:34,500
Feathers have been found on dinosaurs that clearly had no more ability to fly than modern pigs.

36
00:02:34,500 --> 00:02:37,500
Feathers seem to have evolved for warmth.

37
00:02:37,500 --> 00:02:41,500
We use feathers in quilts and sleeping bags for exactly the same reason.

38
00:02:41,500 --> 00:02:45,500
But it turned out these feathers gave dinosaurs an advantage in another area,

39
00:02:45,500 --> 00:02:48,500
acting as aerofoils in either running or gliding,

40
00:02:48,500 --> 00:02:51,500
and over millions of years they helped the evolution of wings.

41
00:02:51,500 --> 00:02:58,500
Dinosaurs never had the capacity to evolve into birds, evolve into birds.

42
00:03:01,500 --> 00:03:06,500
The brain and internal organs of a bird and a reptile

43
00:03:06,500 --> 00:03:08,500
are completely different.

44
00:03:08,500 --> 00:03:11,500
That may be, but if we compare birds and theropod dinosaurs,

45
00:03:11,500 --> 00:03:16,500
we find all kinds of similarities from bone structure, internal organs and even behaviour.

46
00:03:16,500 --> 00:03:19,500
Come on, buddy, you've got to do better than that.

47
00:03:19,500 --> 00:03:23,500
We found and brought back over 200 pounds of dinosaur bones,

48
00:03:23,500 --> 00:03:27,500
200 pounds of dinosaur bones here to be unfossilised.

49
00:03:27,500 --> 00:03:29,500
What an adventure indeed.

50
00:03:29,500 --> 00:03:33,500
Yeah, but how can bones be unfossilised and millions of years old?

51
00:03:34,500 --> 00:03:39,500
Since our creationist scientist is stumped, let me take this one.

52
00:03:39,500 --> 00:03:44,500
The most likely explanation is that Buddy Davis is not for the first time

53
00:03:44,500 --> 00:03:46,500
breaching the ninth commandment.

54
00:03:46,500 --> 00:03:47,500
He's fibbing.

55
00:03:47,500 --> 00:03:49,500
Davis made this claim in a book.

56
00:03:49,500 --> 00:03:53,500
He claims he got these bones from the liscum bone bed in Alaska.

57
00:03:53,500 --> 00:03:58,500
It's a gold mine for palaeontologists who've collected hundreds of dinosaur bones from the site,

58
00:03:58,500 --> 00:04:00,500
but they've all been fossilised.

59
00:04:01,500 --> 00:04:06,500
Buddy Davis goes there and miraculously, his dinosaur bones are unfossilised.

60
00:04:06,500 --> 00:04:08,500
Or so he says.

61
00:04:08,500 --> 00:04:12,500
Since he's reluctant to show these miracle bones to a real palaeontologist,

62
00:04:12,500 --> 00:04:15,500
it's probable he knows what the result would be.

63
00:04:15,500 --> 00:04:20,500
So this whopper is what landed Davis the nomination for this year's coveted Golden Crocoduck.

64
00:04:20,500 --> 00:04:25,500
Well, at least he didn't try the sad old argument that red blood cells have been found in dinosaur bones.

65
00:04:25,500 --> 00:04:31,500
Did you know that some palaeontologists actually found some red blood cells in partially fossilised T-Rex bones?

66
00:04:31,500 --> 00:04:32,500
Oh no.

67
00:04:32,500 --> 00:04:35,500
Buddy, we covered this in a previous video.

68
00:04:35,500 --> 00:04:39,500
No blood cells have ever been found in a dinosaur bone.

69
00:04:39,500 --> 00:04:45,500
It's disturbing that you're making a video trying to rubbish real science with this spurious creationist claptrap,

70
00:04:45,500 --> 00:04:48,500
and disturbing that this is aimed at young children.

71
00:04:48,500 --> 00:04:54,500
But I think there's something even more disturbing in this video that I can't quite put my finger on.

72
00:04:55,500 --> 00:04:58,500
I don't want you to see that it hurts.

73
00:04:58,500 --> 00:05:02,500
It's just you and me.

74
00:05:02,500 --> 00:05:06,500
And when the crowd comes to my door,

75
00:05:06,500 --> 00:05:10,500
when there's only one person.

76
00:05:10,500 --> 00:05:15,500
Oh, my soul.

77
00:05:15,500 --> 00:05:19,500
It takes a soul so long.

78
00:05:19,500 --> 00:05:23,500
Oh, my soul.

79
00:05:24,500 --> 00:05:27,500
It takes a soul so long.

80
00:05:42,500 --> 00:05:45,500
I don't think anybody will miss the point.

81
00:05:45,500 --> 00:05:47,500
The thrill can kill.

82
00:05:47,500 --> 00:05:50,500
Instead of saying something you really don't mean, just say, no!

83
00:05:50,500 --> 00:05:52,500
Dinosaurs aren't millions of years old.

84
00:05:52,500 --> 00:05:54,500
According to the bible.

85
00:05:54,500 --> 00:05:55,500
No.

86
00:05:55,500 --> 00:05:56,500
No thanks.

87
00:05:56,500 --> 00:05:57,500
No way.
