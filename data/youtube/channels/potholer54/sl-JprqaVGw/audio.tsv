0	5000	If you like adventure, then join our team exploring mysteries you have seen.
5000	7500	Get your hiking boots and your backpack too.
7500	10000	Join us in our search for truth.
10000	15500	The Creation Adventure team is headed by a previous Golden Crocoduck nominee, Buddy Davis.
15500	20000	Well, now he's brought us something disturbing and at the same time hilarious
20000	25000	in an attempt to wean kids off science at an early age and get them hooked on religion.
25000	29500	Together with Brad Stein, Phil Snyder, Andy Hosmer and Kathy Henderson,
29500	35500	Buddy tells the children that dinosaurs were fun, cuddly animals that only died out a few thousand years ago.
39500	44500	The plot of this rather confusing story is that a TV reporter goes to talk to a scientist
44500	47500	about what happened to the dinosaurs.
47500	52500	But his explanations are so bad, she goes on some kind of a hallucinogenic trip
52500	59500	and ends up thinking the dinosaurs popped into existence in a couple of days.
59500	64500	Meanwhile, Buddy is outdoors explaining to the kids the real story of what happened to the dinosaurs
64500	67500	with the help of a hyperactive teenager
70500	73500	and a dinosaur in a George Washington fright wig.
73500	76500	Bones in the present! In the present!
76500	82500	The video starts with an apparent mystery. Sorry, apparent mystery, apparent mystery.
82500	88500	There doesn't seem to be a clear understanding by science as to what happened to the dinosaurs.
88500	90500	Actually, there's a very good understanding.
90500	95500	We can tell from the fossil record that dinosaur numbers were falling away in the late Cretaceous,
95500	99500	probably because of the release of sulphur dioxide from the Deccan Traps,
99500	102500	a huge outflow of lava in what's now India.
102500	106500	Most of the dinosaurs that survived were then wiped out by an asteroid,
106500	109500	and there's a very clear record of that too.
109500	114500	But some small dinosaurs survived even that and evolved into modern birds.
114500	117500	Surely the resident scientist can explain this.
117500	124500	The dinosaur's survival instinct actually caused some of them to evolve feathers so they could fly.
124500	126500	Hmm, nice try.
126500	129500	What this shows is that a creationist can pretend to be a scientist,
129500	132500	but it still doesn't help him understand science.
132500	137500	Firstly, it's not the survival instinct that causes evolution, it's natural selection.
137500	142500	If you don't know how that works, check out my video Natural Selection Made Easy.
142500	146500	Secondly, dinosaurs didn't evolve feathers so they could fly.
146500	149500	No animal consciously causes a body part to evolve.
149500	154500	Feathers have been found on dinosaurs that clearly had no more ability to fly than modern pigs.
154500	157500	Feathers seem to have evolved for warmth.
157500	161500	We use feathers in quilts and sleeping bags for exactly the same reason.
161500	165500	But it turned out these feathers gave dinosaurs an advantage in another area,
165500	168500	acting as aerofoils in either running or gliding,
168500	171500	and over millions of years they helped the evolution of wings.
171500	178500	Dinosaurs never had the capacity to evolve into birds, evolve into birds.
181500	186500	The brain and internal organs of a bird and a reptile
186500	188500	are completely different.
188500	191500	That may be, but if we compare birds and theropod dinosaurs,
191500	196500	we find all kinds of similarities from bone structure, internal organs and even behaviour.
196500	199500	Come on, buddy, you've got to do better than that.
199500	203500	We found and brought back over 200 pounds of dinosaur bones,
203500	207500	200 pounds of dinosaur bones here to be unfossilised.
207500	209500	What an adventure indeed.
209500	213500	Yeah, but how can bones be unfossilised and millions of years old?
214500	219500	Since our creationist scientist is stumped, let me take this one.
219500	224500	The most likely explanation is that Buddy Davis is not for the first time
224500	226500	breaching the ninth commandment.
226500	227500	He's fibbing.
227500	229500	Davis made this claim in a book.
229500	233500	He claims he got these bones from the liscum bone bed in Alaska.
233500	238500	It's a gold mine for palaeontologists who've collected hundreds of dinosaur bones from the site,
238500	240500	but they've all been fossilised.
241500	246500	Buddy Davis goes there and miraculously, his dinosaur bones are unfossilised.
246500	248500	Or so he says.
248500	252500	Since he's reluctant to show these miracle bones to a real palaeontologist,
252500	255500	it's probable he knows what the result would be.
255500	260500	So this whopper is what landed Davis the nomination for this year's coveted Golden Crocoduck.
260500	265500	Well, at least he didn't try the sad old argument that red blood cells have been found in dinosaur bones.
265500	271500	Did you know that some palaeontologists actually found some red blood cells in partially fossilised T-Rex bones?
271500	272500	Oh no.
272500	275500	Buddy, we covered this in a previous video.
275500	279500	No blood cells have ever been found in a dinosaur bone.
279500	285500	It's disturbing that you're making a video trying to rubbish real science with this spurious creationist claptrap,
285500	288500	and disturbing that this is aimed at young children.
288500	294500	But I think there's something even more disturbing in this video that I can't quite put my finger on.
295500	298500	I don't want you to see that it hurts.
298500	302500	It's just you and me.
302500	306500	And when the crowd comes to my door,
306500	310500	when there's only one person.
310500	315500	Oh, my soul.
315500	319500	It takes a soul so long.
319500	323500	Oh, my soul.
324500	327500	It takes a soul so long.
342500	345500	I don't think anybody will miss the point.
345500	347500	The thrill can kill.
347500	350500	Instead of saying something you really don't mean, just say, no!
350500	352500	Dinosaurs aren't millions of years old.
352500	354500	According to the bible.
354500	355500	No.
355500	356500	No thanks.
356500	357500	No way.
