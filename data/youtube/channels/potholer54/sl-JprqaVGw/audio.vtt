If you like adventure, then join our team exploring mysteries you have seen.

00:05.000 --> 00:07.500
Get your hiking boots and your backpack too.

00:07.500 --> 00:10.000
Join us in our search for truth.

00:10.000 --> 00:15.500
The Creation Adventure team is headed by a previous Golden Crocoduck nominee, Buddy Davis.

00:15.500 --> 00:20.000
Well, now he's brought us something disturbing and at the same time hilarious

00:20.000 --> 00:25.000
in an attempt to wean kids off science at an early age and get them hooked on religion.

00:25.000 --> 00:29.500
Together with Brad Stein, Phil Snyder, Andy Hosmer and Kathy Henderson,

00:29.500 --> 00:35.500
Buddy tells the children that dinosaurs were fun, cuddly animals that only died out a few thousand years ago.

00:39.500 --> 00:44.500
The plot of this rather confusing story is that a TV reporter goes to talk to a scientist

00:44.500 --> 00:47.500
about what happened to the dinosaurs.

00:47.500 --> 00:52.500
But his explanations are so bad, she goes on some kind of a hallucinogenic trip

00:52.500 --> 00:59.500
and ends up thinking the dinosaurs popped into existence in a couple of days.

00:59.500 --> 01:04.500
Meanwhile, Buddy is outdoors explaining to the kids the real story of what happened to the dinosaurs

01:04.500 --> 01:07.500
with the help of a hyperactive teenager

01:10.500 --> 01:13.500
and a dinosaur in a George Washington fright wig.

01:13.500 --> 01:16.500
Bones in the present! In the present!

01:16.500 --> 01:22.500
The video starts with an apparent mystery. Sorry, apparent mystery, apparent mystery.

01:22.500 --> 01:28.500
There doesn't seem to be a clear understanding by science as to what happened to the dinosaurs.

01:28.500 --> 01:30.500
Actually, there's a very good understanding.

01:30.500 --> 01:35.500
We can tell from the fossil record that dinosaur numbers were falling away in the late Cretaceous,

01:35.500 --> 01:39.500
probably because of the release of sulphur dioxide from the Deccan Traps,

01:39.500 --> 01:42.500
a huge outflow of lava in what's now India.

01:42.500 --> 01:46.500
Most of the dinosaurs that survived were then wiped out by an asteroid,

01:46.500 --> 01:49.500
and there's a very clear record of that too.

01:49.500 --> 01:54.500
But some small dinosaurs survived even that and evolved into modern birds.

01:54.500 --> 01:57.500
Surely the resident scientist can explain this.

01:57.500 --> 02:04.500
The dinosaur's survival instinct actually caused some of them to evolve feathers so they could fly.

02:04.500 --> 02:06.500
Hmm, nice try.

02:06.500 --> 02:09.500
What this shows is that a creationist can pretend to be a scientist,

02:09.500 --> 02:12.500
but it still doesn't help him understand science.

02:12.500 --> 02:17.500
Firstly, it's not the survival instinct that causes evolution, it's natural selection.

02:17.500 --> 02:22.500
If you don't know how that works, check out my video Natural Selection Made Easy.

02:22.500 --> 02:26.500
Secondly, dinosaurs didn't evolve feathers so they could fly.

02:26.500 --> 02:29.500
No animal consciously causes a body part to evolve.

02:29.500 --> 02:34.500
Feathers have been found on dinosaurs that clearly had no more ability to fly than modern pigs.

02:34.500 --> 02:37.500
Feathers seem to have evolved for warmth.

02:37.500 --> 02:41.500
We use feathers in quilts and sleeping bags for exactly the same reason.

02:41.500 --> 02:45.500
But it turned out these feathers gave dinosaurs an advantage in another area,

02:45.500 --> 02:48.500
acting as aerofoils in either running or gliding,

02:48.500 --> 02:51.500
and over millions of years they helped the evolution of wings.

02:51.500 --> 02:58.500
Dinosaurs never had the capacity to evolve into birds, evolve into birds.

03:01.500 --> 03:06.500
The brain and internal organs of a bird and a reptile

03:06.500 --> 03:08.500
are completely different.

03:08.500 --> 03:11.500
That may be, but if we compare birds and theropod dinosaurs,

03:11.500 --> 03:16.500
we find all kinds of similarities from bone structure, internal organs and even behaviour.

03:16.500 --> 03:19.500
Come on, buddy, you've got to do better than that.

03:19.500 --> 03:23.500
We found and brought back over 200 pounds of dinosaur bones,

03:23.500 --> 03:27.500
200 pounds of dinosaur bones here to be unfossilised.

03:27.500 --> 03:29.500
What an adventure indeed.

03:29.500 --> 03:33.500
Yeah, but how can bones be unfossilised and millions of years old?

03:34.500 --> 03:39.500
Since our creationist scientist is stumped, let me take this one.

03:39.500 --> 03:44.500
The most likely explanation is that Buddy Davis is not for the first time

03:44.500 --> 03:46.500
breaching the ninth commandment.

03:46.500 --> 03:47.500
He's fibbing.

03:47.500 --> 03:49.500
Davis made this claim in a book.

03:49.500 --> 03:53.500
He claims he got these bones from the liscum bone bed in Alaska.

03:53.500 --> 03:58.500
It's a gold mine for palaeontologists who've collected hundreds of dinosaur bones from the site,

03:58.500 --> 04:00.500
but they've all been fossilised.

04:01.500 --> 04:06.500
Buddy Davis goes there and miraculously, his dinosaur bones are unfossilised.

04:06.500 --> 04:08.500
Or so he says.

04:08.500 --> 04:12.500
Since he's reluctant to show these miracle bones to a real palaeontologist,

04:12.500 --> 04:15.500
it's probable he knows what the result would be.

04:15.500 --> 04:20.500
So this whopper is what landed Davis the nomination for this year's coveted Golden Crocoduck.

04:20.500 --> 04:25.500
Well, at least he didn't try the sad old argument that red blood cells have been found in dinosaur bones.

04:25.500 --> 04:31.500
Did you know that some palaeontologists actually found some red blood cells in partially fossilised T-Rex bones?

04:31.500 --> 04:32.500
Oh no.

04:32.500 --> 04:35.500
Buddy, we covered this in a previous video.

04:35.500 --> 04:39.500
No blood cells have ever been found in a dinosaur bone.

04:39.500 --> 04:45.500
It's disturbing that you're making a video trying to rubbish real science with this spurious creationist claptrap,

04:45.500 --> 04:48.500
and disturbing that this is aimed at young children.

04:48.500 --> 04:54.500
But I think there's something even more disturbing in this video that I can't quite put my finger on.

04:55.500 --> 04:58.500
I don't want you to see that it hurts.

04:58.500 --> 05:02.500
It's just you and me.

05:02.500 --> 05:06.500
And when the crowd comes to my door,

05:06.500 --> 05:10.500
when there's only one person.

05:10.500 --> 05:15.500
Oh, my soul.

05:15.500 --> 05:19.500
It takes a soul so long.

05:19.500 --> 05:23.500
Oh, my soul.

05:24.500 --> 05:27.500
It takes a soul so long.

05:42.500 --> 05:45.500
I don't think anybody will miss the point.

05:45.500 --> 05:47.500
The thrill can kill.

05:47.500 --> 05:50.500
Instead of saying something you really don't mean, just say, no!

05:50.500 --> 05:52.500
Dinosaurs aren't millions of years old.

05:52.500 --> 05:54.500
According to the bible.

05:54.500 --> 05:55.500
No.

05:55.500 --> 05:56.500
No thanks.

05:56.500 --> 05:57.500
No way.
