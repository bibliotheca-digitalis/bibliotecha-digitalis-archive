0	3500	I'm sure you've all seen this by now.
3500	7360	Met Office releases new figures that show no warming in fifteen years.
7360	11420	It's a story in the mail on Sunday, written by David Rose.
11420	16240	The story has gone viral, being repeated in blogs all over the internet, without any of
16240	19320	them bothering to check or verify it.
19320	24340	Even though the British Meteorological Office issued a public statement correcting the mail's
24340	25340	story.
25340	29220	Despite the Met Office having spoken to David Rose ahead of the publication of the story,
29220	34500	he has chosen to not fully include the answers we gave him to questions around decadal projections
34500	39580	produced by the Met Office, or his belief that we have seen no warming since 1997.
39580	43460	Oh dear, looks like Rose got the story wrong.
43460	46460	He won't be making that mistake again.
46460	48300	But yes, he did.
48300	51940	Eagle-eyed viewers will have spotted that this claim about the Met Office admitting
51940	56600	fifteen years of no warming was made back in January.
56600	61320	Ten months on, Rose has given birth to yet another story that looks like a carbon copy
61320	63360	of the first.
63360	68800	Global warming stopped sixteen years ago, reveals Met Office report, quietly released.
68800	73720	And once again, the bloggers are regurgitating this without bothering to read the Met Office
73720	78360	report, because if they'd tried, they would have quickly discovered that there is no Met
78360	79760	Office report.
79760	84860	The Met Office simply released updated global temperature data, called Hadcrot 4, along
84860	89020	with a four-line description of how the dataset was compiled.
89020	93020	There was no analysis or interpretation of the data at all.
93020	99580	Rose invented this fictitious report in order to stamp his own interpretation on the data.
99580	104260	And just as in January, the Met Office issued a statement correcting the Mail on Sunday
104260	108460	story, as Yogi Berra would say, déjà vu all over again.
108460	113080	The Met Office even took the unusual step of publishing its response given to Rose when
113080	116580	he made some enquiries before writing his story.
116580	121560	When Rose specifically asked if there'd been no warming trend since 1997, the Met Office
121560	125920	responded, there has been a warming trend, it even gave him the figure.
125920	130840	It then explained the principle of determining trends, and the pitfalls of arbitrarily choosing
130840	135600	start and end points over a short period of time, and drawing a straight line in between
135600	136600	them.
136600	140880	It tried to explain, just as I have in my videos, that in the short term, climate is
140880	147360	not only affected by CO2, but by other factors such as ocean-based oscillations.
147360	151560	Almost none of the information the Met Office gave him made it into Rose's story.
151560	155840	Rose simply made up his own interpretation of the data, and made it look as though this
155840	158320	came from a Met Office report.
158320	163040	Then Rose proudly announced that, until today, this has not been reported.
163040	167840	Hate to break it to you, David, but the reason no one else reported on this is because even
167840	172520	other tabloid newspapers didn't have the balls to pluck all this out of thin air, and
172520	176000	then try to pass it off as the work of the Met Office.
176000	181200	For Rose to do his own analysis is fine, as long as he and the Mail on Sunday make this
181200	182300	clear.
182300	186380	Just tell the world that a tabloid newspaper reporter with no background in science has
186380	192000	concluded that global warming stopped in 1997, as far as he can tell, and let the world make
192000	193920	of that what they will.
193920	198420	If that admission had been made, I doubt we'd be seeing Rose's analysis plastered all over
198420	201280	the internet, and in the mainstream media.
201280	203440	Global warming ended 16 years ago.
203440	205280	That's according to new data which shows...
205280	210880	No, that's according to an unqualified tabloid journalist who took a stab at analysing this
210880	212880	data himself.
212880	217880	Why people still insist on unconditionally believing the Daily Mail, despite its appalling
217880	222960	record of inaccurate reporting on climate science, is beyond me, and why anyone would
223000	227960	want to send me a message claiming the Met Office's published findings that there has
227960	233740	been no verifiable warming for 16 years, as if I would be so stupid and so gullible as
233740	238640	to believe this quote without bothering to check it, is also beyond me.
238640	243760	If I've emphasised anything on my channel, it's the importance of checking and verifying
243760	244920	sources.
244920	250000	Fortunately, most of the people who messaged me about the Mail story saw right through
250000	253800	it, and were sensible enough to check the facts for themselves.
253800	258000	But I'm frankly getting tired of having to do the checking for all those gullible bloggers
258000	262900	out there who simply repeat this stuff without checking it.
262900	267120	Now I'm sure the comments forum will be filled with a lot of amateur climatologists who'll
267120	271960	tell me they've looked at the Daily Mail graph, and it does look like global warming stopped
271960	274400	in 1997.
274400	279880	Well I've made several videos explaining why experts see things very differently to amateurs,
279880	284320	because the experts take into account various factors that are either not understood or
284320	286240	ignored by the amateurs.
286240	290380	So before you start giving me your beliefs and gut feeling about what the graph looks
290380	295680	like to you, please visit these videos and find out how climate scientists calculate
295680	297340	temperature trends.
297340	302000	If you think the experts are wrong, then you have ample space on those video fora to give
302000	305360	us the benefit of your expertise.
305360	309640	My beef here is not with the tired old myth that global warming has stopped, but with
309640	314680	the disingenuousness of reporters and tabloid newspapers that are willing to change facts
314680	319480	to make a sensational story, and with the blogging blockheads who are willing to swallow
319480	323240	their stories without a hint of scepticism.
323240	325660	Look guys, I admit I'm not very smart.
325660	328240	I came bottom of my class at school.
328240	333040	What I do on this channel is not super human, I use my experience as a science reporter
333040	336780	to try to convey what scientific research has discovered.
336780	341240	And when I read something that reports on scientific research, I check it.
341240	345880	To climate science critics, any one of you could have checked the mail on Sunday's story.
345880	350140	It would have taken just a few seconds to click on the Met Office website to see what
350140	354220	this so-called report says, or even if it exists.
354220	356580	Really, how hard can that be?
