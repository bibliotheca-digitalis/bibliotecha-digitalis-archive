00:00.000 --> 00:03.500
I'm sure you've all seen this by now.

00:03.500 --> 00:07.360
Met Office releases new figures that show no warming in fifteen years.

00:07.360 --> 00:11.420
It's a story in the mail on Sunday, written by David Rose.

00:11.420 --> 00:16.240
The story has gone viral, being repeated in blogs all over the internet, without any of

00:16.240 --> 00:19.320
them bothering to check or verify it.

00:19.320 --> 00:24.340
Even though the British Meteorological Office issued a public statement correcting the mail's

00:24.340 --> 00:25.340
story.

00:25.340 --> 00:29.220
Despite the Met Office having spoken to David Rose ahead of the publication of the story,

00:29.220 --> 00:34.500
he has chosen to not fully include the answers we gave him to questions around decadal projections

00:34.500 --> 00:39.580
produced by the Met Office, or his belief that we have seen no warming since 1997.

00:39.580 --> 00:43.460
Oh dear, looks like Rose got the story wrong.

00:43.460 --> 00:46.460
He won't be making that mistake again.

00:46.460 --> 00:48.300
But yes, he did.

00:48.300 --> 00:51.940
Eagle-eyed viewers will have spotted that this claim about the Met Office admitting

00:51.940 --> 00:56.600
fifteen years of no warming was made back in January.

00:56.600 --> 01:01.320
Ten months on, Rose has given birth to yet another story that looks like a carbon copy

01:01.320 --> 01:03.360
of the first.

01:03.360 --> 01:08.800
Global warming stopped sixteen years ago, reveals Met Office report, quietly released.

01:08.800 --> 01:13.720
And once again, the bloggers are regurgitating this without bothering to read the Met Office

01:13.720 --> 01:18.360
report, because if they'd tried, they would have quickly discovered that there is no Met

01:18.360 --> 01:19.760
Office report.

01:19.760 --> 01:24.860
The Met Office simply released updated global temperature data, called Hadcrot 4, along

01:24.860 --> 01:29.020
with a four-line description of how the dataset was compiled.

01:29.020 --> 01:33.020
There was no analysis or interpretation of the data at all.

01:33.020 --> 01:39.580
Rose invented this fictitious report in order to stamp his own interpretation on the data.

01:39.580 --> 01:44.260
And just as in January, the Met Office issued a statement correcting the Mail on Sunday

01:44.260 --> 01:48.460
story, as Yogi Berra would say, déjà vu all over again.

01:48.460 --> 01:53.080
The Met Office even took the unusual step of publishing its response given to Rose when

01:53.080 --> 01:56.580
he made some enquiries before writing his story.

01:56.580 --> 02:01.560
When Rose specifically asked if there'd been no warming trend since 1997, the Met Office

02:01.560 --> 02:05.920
responded, there has been a warming trend, it even gave him the figure.

02:05.920 --> 02:10.840
It then explained the principle of determining trends, and the pitfalls of arbitrarily choosing

02:10.840 --> 02:15.600
start and end points over a short period of time, and drawing a straight line in between

02:15.600 --> 02:16.600
them.

02:16.600 --> 02:20.880
It tried to explain, just as I have in my videos, that in the short term, climate is

02:20.880 --> 02:27.360
not only affected by CO2, but by other factors such as ocean-based oscillations.

02:27.360 --> 02:31.560
Almost none of the information the Met Office gave him made it into Rose's story.

02:31.560 --> 02:35.840
Rose simply made up his own interpretation of the data, and made it look as though this

02:35.840 --> 02:38.320
came from a Met Office report.

02:38.320 --> 02:43.040
Then Rose proudly announced that, until today, this has not been reported.

02:43.040 --> 02:47.840
Hate to break it to you, David, but the reason no one else reported on this is because even

02:47.840 --> 02:52.520
other tabloid newspapers didn't have the balls to pluck all this out of thin air, and

02:52.520 --> 02:56.000
then try to pass it off as the work of the Met Office.

02:56.000 --> 03:01.200
For Rose to do his own analysis is fine, as long as he and the Mail on Sunday make this

03:01.200 --> 03:02.300
clear.

03:02.300 --> 03:06.380
Just tell the world that a tabloid newspaper reporter with no background in science has

03:06.380 --> 03:12.000
concluded that global warming stopped in 1997, as far as he can tell, and let the world make

03:12.000 --> 03:13.920
of that what they will.

03:13.920 --> 03:18.420
If that admission had been made, I doubt we'd be seeing Rose's analysis plastered all over

03:18.420 --> 03:21.280
the internet, and in the mainstream media.

03:21.280 --> 03:23.440
Global warming ended 16 years ago.

03:23.440 --> 03:25.280
That's according to new data which shows...

03:25.280 --> 03:30.880
No, that's according to an unqualified tabloid journalist who took a stab at analysing this

03:30.880 --> 03:32.880
data himself.

03:32.880 --> 03:37.880
Why people still insist on unconditionally believing the Daily Mail, despite its appalling

03:37.880 --> 03:42.960
record of inaccurate reporting on climate science, is beyond me, and why anyone would

03:43.000 --> 03:47.960
want to send me a message claiming the Met Office's published findings that there has

03:47.960 --> 03:53.740
been no verifiable warming for 16 years, as if I would be so stupid and so gullible as

03:53.740 --> 03:58.640
to believe this quote without bothering to check it, is also beyond me.

03:58.640 --> 04:03.760
If I've emphasised anything on my channel, it's the importance of checking and verifying

04:03.760 --> 04:04.920
sources.

04:04.920 --> 04:10.000
Fortunately, most of the people who messaged me about the Mail story saw right through

04:10.000 --> 04:13.800
it, and were sensible enough to check the facts for themselves.

04:13.800 --> 04:18.000
But I'm frankly getting tired of having to do the checking for all those gullible bloggers

04:18.000 --> 04:22.900
out there who simply repeat this stuff without checking it.

04:22.900 --> 04:27.120
Now I'm sure the comments forum will be filled with a lot of amateur climatologists who'll

04:27.120 --> 04:31.960
tell me they've looked at the Daily Mail graph, and it does look like global warming stopped

04:31.960 --> 04:34.400
in 1997.

04:34.400 --> 04:39.880
Well I've made several videos explaining why experts see things very differently to amateurs,

04:39.880 --> 04:44.320
because the experts take into account various factors that are either not understood or

04:44.320 --> 04:46.240
ignored by the amateurs.

04:46.240 --> 04:50.380
So before you start giving me your beliefs and gut feeling about what the graph looks

04:50.380 --> 04:55.680
like to you, please visit these videos and find out how climate scientists calculate

04:55.680 --> 04:57.340
temperature trends.

04:57.340 --> 05:02.000
If you think the experts are wrong, then you have ample space on those video fora to give

05:02.000 --> 05:05.360
us the benefit of your expertise.

05:05.360 --> 05:09.640
My beef here is not with the tired old myth that global warming has stopped, but with

05:09.640 --> 05:14.680
the disingenuousness of reporters and tabloid newspapers that are willing to change facts

05:14.680 --> 05:19.480
to make a sensational story, and with the blogging blockheads who are willing to swallow

05:19.480 --> 05:23.240
their stories without a hint of scepticism.

05:23.240 --> 05:25.660
Look guys, I admit I'm not very smart.

05:25.660 --> 05:28.240
I came bottom of my class at school.

05:28.240 --> 05:33.040
What I do on this channel is not super human, I use my experience as a science reporter

05:33.040 --> 05:36.780
to try to convey what scientific research has discovered.

05:36.780 --> 05:41.240
And when I read something that reports on scientific research, I check it.

05:41.240 --> 05:45.880
To climate science critics, any one of you could have checked the mail on Sunday's story.

05:45.880 --> 05:50.140
It would have taken just a few seconds to click on the Met Office website to see what

05:50.140 --> 05:54.220
this so-called report says, or even if it exists.

05:54.220 --> 05:56.580
Really, how hard can that be?
