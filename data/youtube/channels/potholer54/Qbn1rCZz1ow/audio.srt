1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,500
I'm sure you've all seen this by now.

2
00:00:03,500 --> 00:00:07,360
Met Office releases new figures that show no warming in fifteen years.

3
00:00:07,360 --> 00:00:11,420
It's a story in the mail on Sunday, written by David Rose.

4
00:00:11,420 --> 00:00:16,240
The story has gone viral, being repeated in blogs all over the internet, without any of

5
00:00:16,240 --> 00:00:19,320
them bothering to check or verify it.

6
00:00:19,320 --> 00:00:24,340
Even though the British Meteorological Office issued a public statement correcting the mail's

7
00:00:24,340 --> 00:00:25,340
story.

8
00:00:25,340 --> 00:00:29,220
Despite the Met Office having spoken to David Rose ahead of the publication of the story,

9
00:00:29,220 --> 00:00:34,500
he has chosen to not fully include the answers we gave him to questions around decadal projections

10
00:00:34,500 --> 00:00:39,580
produced by the Met Office, or his belief that we have seen no warming since 1997.

11
00:00:39,580 --> 00:00:43,460
Oh dear, looks like Rose got the story wrong.

12
00:00:43,460 --> 00:00:46,460
He won't be making that mistake again.

13
00:00:46,460 --> 00:00:48,300
But yes, he did.

14
00:00:48,300 --> 00:00:51,940
Eagle-eyed viewers will have spotted that this claim about the Met Office admitting

15
00:00:51,940 --> 00:00:56,600
fifteen years of no warming was made back in January.

16
00:00:56,600 --> 00:01:01,320
Ten months on, Rose has given birth to yet another story that looks like a carbon copy

17
00:01:01,320 --> 00:01:03,360
of the first.

18
00:01:03,360 --> 00:01:08,800
Global warming stopped sixteen years ago, reveals Met Office report, quietly released.

19
00:01:08,800 --> 00:01:13,720
And once again, the bloggers are regurgitating this without bothering to read the Met Office

20
00:01:13,720 --> 00:01:18,360
report, because if they'd tried, they would have quickly discovered that there is no Met

21
00:01:18,360 --> 00:01:19,760
Office report.

22
00:01:19,760 --> 00:01:24,860
The Met Office simply released updated global temperature data, called Hadcrot 4, along

23
00:01:24,860 --> 00:01:29,020
with a four-line description of how the dataset was compiled.

24
00:01:29,020 --> 00:01:33,020
There was no analysis or interpretation of the data at all.

25
00:01:33,020 --> 00:01:39,580
Rose invented this fictitious report in order to stamp his own interpretation on the data.

26
00:01:39,580 --> 00:01:44,260
And just as in January, the Met Office issued a statement correcting the Mail on Sunday

27
00:01:44,260 --> 00:01:48,460
story, as Yogi Berra would say, déjà vu all over again.

28
00:01:48,460 --> 00:01:53,080
The Met Office even took the unusual step of publishing its response given to Rose when

29
00:01:53,080 --> 00:01:56,580
he made some enquiries before writing his story.

30
00:01:56,580 --> 00:02:01,560
When Rose specifically asked if there'd been no warming trend since 1997, the Met Office

31
00:02:01,560 --> 00:02:05,920
responded, there has been a warming trend, it even gave him the figure.

32
00:02:05,920 --> 00:02:10,840
It then explained the principle of determining trends, and the pitfalls of arbitrarily choosing

33
00:02:10,840 --> 00:02:15,600
start and end points over a short period of time, and drawing a straight line in between

34
00:02:15,600 --> 00:02:16,600
them.

35
00:02:16,600 --> 00:02:20,880
It tried to explain, just as I have in my videos, that in the short term, climate is

36
00:02:20,880 --> 00:02:27,360
not only affected by CO2, but by other factors such as ocean-based oscillations.

37
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:31,560
Almost none of the information the Met Office gave him made it into Rose's story.

38
00:02:31,560 --> 00:02:35,840
Rose simply made up his own interpretation of the data, and made it look as though this

39
00:02:35,840 --> 00:02:38,320
came from a Met Office report.

40
00:02:38,320 --> 00:02:43,040
Then Rose proudly announced that, until today, this has not been reported.

41
00:02:43,040 --> 00:02:47,840
Hate to break it to you, David, but the reason no one else reported on this is because even

42
00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:52,520
other tabloid newspapers didn't have the balls to pluck all this out of thin air, and

43
00:02:52,520 --> 00:02:56,000
then try to pass it off as the work of the Met Office.

44
00:02:56,000 --> 00:03:01,200
For Rose to do his own analysis is fine, as long as he and the Mail on Sunday make this

45
00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:02,300
clear.

46
00:03:02,300 --> 00:03:06,380
Just tell the world that a tabloid newspaper reporter with no background in science has

47
00:03:06,380 --> 00:03:12,000
concluded that global warming stopped in 1997, as far as he can tell, and let the world make

48
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:13,920
of that what they will.

49
00:03:13,920 --> 00:03:18,420
If that admission had been made, I doubt we'd be seeing Rose's analysis plastered all over

50
00:03:18,420 --> 00:03:21,280
the internet, and in the mainstream media.

51
00:03:21,280 --> 00:03:23,440
Global warming ended 16 years ago.

52
00:03:23,440 --> 00:03:25,280
That's according to new data which shows...

53
00:03:25,280 --> 00:03:30,880
No, that's according to an unqualified tabloid journalist who took a stab at analysing this

54
00:03:30,880 --> 00:03:32,880
data himself.

55
00:03:32,880 --> 00:03:37,880
Why people still insist on unconditionally believing the Daily Mail, despite its appalling

56
00:03:37,880 --> 00:03:42,960
record of inaccurate reporting on climate science, is beyond me, and why anyone would

57
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:47,960
want to send me a message claiming the Met Office's published findings that there has

58
00:03:47,960 --> 00:03:53,740
been no verifiable warming for 16 years, as if I would be so stupid and so gullible as

59
00:03:53,740 --> 00:03:58,640
to believe this quote without bothering to check it, is also beyond me.

60
00:03:58,640 --> 00:04:03,760
If I've emphasised anything on my channel, it's the importance of checking and verifying

61
00:04:03,760 --> 00:04:04,920
sources.

62
00:04:04,920 --> 00:04:10,000
Fortunately, most of the people who messaged me about the Mail story saw right through

63
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:13,800
it, and were sensible enough to check the facts for themselves.

64
00:04:13,800 --> 00:04:18,000
But I'm frankly getting tired of having to do the checking for all those gullible bloggers

65
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:22,900
out there who simply repeat this stuff without checking it.

66
00:04:22,900 --> 00:04:27,120
Now I'm sure the comments forum will be filled with a lot of amateur climatologists who'll

67
00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:31,960
tell me they've looked at the Daily Mail graph, and it does look like global warming stopped

68
00:04:31,960 --> 00:04:34,400
in 1997.

69
00:04:34,400 --> 00:04:39,880
Well I've made several videos explaining why experts see things very differently to amateurs,

70
00:04:39,880 --> 00:04:44,320
because the experts take into account various factors that are either not understood or

71
00:04:44,320 --> 00:04:46,240
ignored by the amateurs.

72
00:04:46,240 --> 00:04:50,380
So before you start giving me your beliefs and gut feeling about what the graph looks

73
00:04:50,380 --> 00:04:55,680
like to you, please visit these videos and find out how climate scientists calculate

74
00:04:55,680 --> 00:04:57,340
temperature trends.

75
00:04:57,340 --> 00:05:02,000
If you think the experts are wrong, then you have ample space on those video fora to give

76
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:05,360
us the benefit of your expertise.

77
00:05:05,360 --> 00:05:09,640
My beef here is not with the tired old myth that global warming has stopped, but with

78
00:05:09,640 --> 00:05:14,680
the disingenuousness of reporters and tabloid newspapers that are willing to change facts

79
00:05:14,680 --> 00:05:19,480
to make a sensational story, and with the blogging blockheads who are willing to swallow

80
00:05:19,480 --> 00:05:23,240
their stories without a hint of scepticism.

81
00:05:23,240 --> 00:05:25,660
Look guys, I admit I'm not very smart.

82
00:05:25,660 --> 00:05:28,240
I came bottom of my class at school.

83
00:05:28,240 --> 00:05:33,040
What I do on this channel is not super human, I use my experience as a science reporter

84
00:05:33,040 --> 00:05:36,780
to try to convey what scientific research has discovered.

85
00:05:36,780 --> 00:05:41,240
And when I read something that reports on scientific research, I check it.

86
00:05:41,240 --> 00:05:45,880
To climate science critics, any one of you could have checked the mail on Sunday's story.

87
00:05:45,880 --> 00:05:50,140
It would have taken just a few seconds to click on the Met Office website to see what

88
00:05:50,140 --> 00:05:54,220
this so-called report says, or even if it exists.

89
00:05:54,220 --> 00:05:56,580
Really, how hard can that be?
