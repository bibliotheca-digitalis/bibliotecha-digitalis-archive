00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,440
In my last video I looked at a couple of emails that have been held up as

2
00:00:03,440 --> 00:00:09,520
Exhibit A for fudging climate data, and as we saw it's not quite as simple as that.

3
00:00:09,520 --> 00:00:13,600
This goes for the other area I said I'd be happy to look at, which is the contention

4
00:00:13,600 --> 00:00:18,640
that the emailers were trying to stifle scientific debate and block alternative ideas.

5
00:00:19,440 --> 00:00:23,600
First, let me clear up any misunderstanding about how these papers get published

6
00:00:23,600 --> 00:00:29,200
and especially the process of peer review. It's a system that's been around for over 200 years,

7
00:00:29,280 --> 00:00:32,960
and its purpose is to keep bad research out of the scientific literature.

8
00:00:33,680 --> 00:00:38,880
Referees look through submitted papers for obvious mistakes and flaws in methodology,

9
00:00:38,880 --> 00:00:44,400
and advise the editor of the journal accordingly. Papers are excluded if the mistakes and flaws are

10
00:00:44,400 --> 00:00:50,480
very obvious. A paper should not be excluded simply because a referee or an editor disagrees

11
00:00:50,480 --> 00:00:56,320
with its contents or its conclusions. The question is, did the emailers want to keep papers from

12
00:00:56,320 --> 00:01:01,120
being published because they disagreed with them, or because the papers were full of basic errors?

13
00:01:01,840 --> 00:01:06,960
The assumption among conspiracy theorists is the former. The rationale the emailers themselves

14
00:01:06,960 --> 00:01:12,240
give is that the research is crap, and we even see them rebutting privately and publicly what

15
00:01:12,240 --> 00:01:16,400
they deem to be crap coming from their own colleagues who support climate change.

16
00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:22,000
I couldn't find one comment about wanting to keep a paper out because it highlights flaws

17
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:26,640
in the climate change model. Of course the emailers could be lying, but if they're part

18
00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:32,400
of a conspiracy and communicating privately, why would they lie to each other? Here's an email

19
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:37,680
that's been held up in the media and on skeptic blogs as a prime example. I didn't cherry pick

20
00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:42,800
this, it's been cherry picked by hundreds of blogs and media commentators out of a thousand emails

21
00:01:42,800 --> 00:01:48,080
that had already been cherry picked. So if you think I shouldn't be talking about it, blame them,

22
00:01:48,080 --> 00:01:53,200
not me. It refers to boycotting the journal Climate Research, following the publication

23
00:01:53,200 --> 00:02:00,000
of a 2003 paper by climate skeptics Willie Soon and Sally Baliunas. At first sight it seems like

24
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:04,880
a very clumsy attempt at censoring a paper that didn't conform to the consensus model.

25
00:02:05,440 --> 00:02:11,120
But let's look at some of the background. Their work wasn't original research, it was a review of

26
00:02:11,120 --> 00:02:17,200
around 240 previously published studies. They looked at climate proxy records such as tree

27
00:02:17,200 --> 00:02:22,240
rings, lake sediments and ice cores over the last thousand years and concluded that overall

28
00:02:22,240 --> 00:02:27,600
the 20th century doesn't contain the warmest anomaly of the past millennium. The problem

29
00:02:27,600 --> 00:02:32,800
with the paper wasn't that it contained mistakes and the methodology was flawed. A lot of papers

30
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:38,000
get published and then mistakes and flaws are found afterwards. The problem was that the mistakes

31
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:43,680
were so obvious and the methodology so clearly flawed, climatologists say the paper should never

32
00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:48,480
have been published in the first place. Even authors of the papers being cited as source

33
00:02:48,480 --> 00:02:54,000
material objected to the way their work was misinterpreted. One problem may have been that

34
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:59,840
Soon and Baliunas, who were astrophysicists, were looking at things like tree ring data with little

35
00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:05,360
knowledge or expertise in that field. A number of climatologists later critiqued the study.

36
00:03:05,360 --> 00:03:10,160
They found that Soon and Baliunas had confused tree ring growth due to warmth with tree ring

37
00:03:10,160 --> 00:03:14,720
growth due to rainfall. They had compared historical proxies with average temperatures

38
00:03:14,720 --> 00:03:19,760
for the 20th century as a whole, instead of the late 20th century, which is the period of

39
00:03:19,760 --> 00:03:24,960
anomalous warming. They had assumed that local variations in temperature could be interpreted

40
00:03:24,960 --> 00:03:29,920
as global variations. If this had been an undergraduate paper, it would have been returned

41
00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:36,160
with an F. Soon and Baliunas' paper was so bad that half the editorial board of the journal

42
00:03:36,160 --> 00:03:41,280
Climate Research resigned after one of the editors was refused permission to publish an

43
00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:47,040
editorial pointing out the mistakes. This is some of the background and context that's missing,

44
00:03:47,040 --> 00:03:50,960
from the line that Phil Jones and his colleagues were threatening to boycott the journal

45
00:03:50,960 --> 00:03:56,880
because they wanted to stifle alternative views. Scientific journals aren't like books or news

46
00:03:56,880 --> 00:04:02,160
magazines. Their purpose isn't to give unsubstantiated opinions or stir up controversy

47
00:04:02,160 --> 00:04:07,280
or spark debate. They're supposed to document observations and give conclusions that are

48
00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:12,480
consistent with those observations. Once a paper is published, it can be legitimately used to

49
00:04:12,480 --> 00:04:18,080
support future papers. It's impossible to keep all flawed research out of the scientific literature

50
00:04:18,080 --> 00:04:23,280
because, as I said, sometimes the flaws aren't found until after publications. But if the

51
00:04:23,280 --> 00:04:28,000
mistakes are blindingly obvious, then there's absolutely no excuse for publishing them.

52
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:33,840
What concerned me when I saw these emails wasn't that the email is objected to crappy papers being

53
00:04:33,840 --> 00:04:38,480
published in reputable journals. I expect scientists in any field would be similarly

54
00:04:38,480 --> 00:04:43,440
opposed. What concerned me was that they might also be trying to keep out well-written

55
00:04:43,440 --> 00:04:47,200
scientific papers simply because they didn't conform to the consensus.

56
00:04:47,840 --> 00:04:51,920
If you've watched my climate change series from the beginning, you'll know my position.

57
00:04:52,480 --> 00:04:56,720
I'm very much in favour of publishing well-researched studies that challenge the

58
00:04:56,720 --> 00:05:01,680
climate change model. Challengers force scientists to test their evidence and oblige

59
00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:06,480
them to look at alternative explanations. So throughout my climate change series,

60
00:05:06,480 --> 00:05:11,120
I've highlighted alternative models that have been proposed by thoughtful researchers like

61
00:05:11,120 --> 00:05:17,040
Egel Fries Christensen and Nia Shaviv. But while problems have been found with these models,

62
00:05:17,040 --> 00:05:22,560
they certainly don't fall under the category of grade F papers. As far as I know, no one has

63
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:28,400
bothered to check whether these better quality papers have been similarly opposed. It's not hard.

64
00:05:28,400 --> 00:05:33,840
I simply word-searched Christi, Weser, Shaviv, Lindsen, Svensmark and Fries Christensen,

65
00:05:33,840 --> 00:05:37,680
sceptics who know their stuff and who've written important papers challenging

66
00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:42,720
anthropogenic climate change. Given the importance and influence of their research,

67
00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:47,120
you would have thought they'd be talked about endlessly in these emails over the last 13 years.

68
00:05:47,840 --> 00:05:52,880
And if this is a conspiracy, then a lot of that talk would surely be about blocking their papers

69
00:05:52,880 --> 00:05:58,720
from the scientific literature. But I found only one polite reference to Svensmark and no

70
00:05:58,720 --> 00:06:04,400
references at all to Weser, Shaviv and Fries Christensen. No doubt they were talked about,

71
00:06:04,400 --> 00:06:09,280
but the talk didn't make it into the list of 1000 emails guiding us towards a conspiracy.

72
00:06:09,840 --> 00:06:14,640
John Christi was mentioned many times because he was in regular correspondence with the Climatic

73
00:06:14,640 --> 00:06:20,720
Research Unit. Richard Lindsen's papers came in for a lot of criticism, including a point-by-point

74
00:06:20,720 --> 00:06:26,560
scientific rebuttal by Kevin Trenberth. But there was no talk of trying to block his papers.

75
00:06:26,560 --> 00:06:32,160
The closest I got was this email from Phil Jones, which refers to passages by Lindsen in a US

76
00:06:32,160 --> 00:06:38,080
climate change science programme study. In 13 years of emails, I couldn't find any talk of

77
00:06:38,080 --> 00:06:44,240
blocking any papers written by any of these prominent sceptics. So let me repeat what I

78
00:06:44,240 --> 00:06:48,880
said in the first video. This doesn't mean there was no skullduggery. It doesn't mean there was

79
00:06:48,880 --> 00:06:54,720
no rejection of papers on spurious grounds, no fudging of data. But simply reading out these

80
00:06:54,720 --> 00:07:00,240
emails and yelling fraud tells us nothing. They all need to be properly investigated.

81
00:07:00,880 --> 00:07:05,280
Finally, let me clear up a persistent misunderstanding about tree ring data.

82
00:07:05,280 --> 00:07:10,080
We can measure global temperatures quite easily in the industrial era with thermometers and other

83
00:07:10,080 --> 00:07:16,400
devices. But pre-record temperatures are measured by other means, things like tree rings, ice cores,

84
00:07:16,400 --> 00:07:22,320
lake bed sediments and coral. But tree rings present a particular problem. Generally, they're

85
00:07:22,320 --> 00:07:28,000
wider when it's warm and narrower when it's cool. Tree ring data fit reasonably well with all the

86
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:34,000
other proxy temperature data. But about 50 years ago, temperatures indicated by tree ring data

87
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:38,080
in some trees began to diverge from temperatures recorded by thermometers.

88
00:07:38,640 --> 00:07:43,520
While modern instruments show the earth has been warming over the last 50 years, the tree ring data

89
00:07:43,520 --> 00:07:49,200
suggests it was cooling. Even sceptics don't doubt that the instruments are right and the tree ring

90
00:07:49,200 --> 00:07:55,360
data are wrong. We know the earth's been warming and not cooling. Skeptics argue that the divergence

91
00:07:55,360 --> 00:08:01,520
means tree rings can't be trusted as a proxy and shouldn't be used. Proponents argue that recent

92
00:08:01,520 --> 00:08:06,640
tree ring growth has been influenced by post-war industrialisation and since it correlates well

93
00:08:06,640 --> 00:08:12,080
prior to that, it should be used. So much fuss is made of this, you'd think it was a central

94
00:08:12,080 --> 00:08:17,600
pillar of the theory of climate change. It isn't. The link between carbon dioxide and global

95
00:08:17,600 --> 00:08:22,720
temperatures was established before Phil Jones and his colleagues were even born. And that won't

96
00:08:22,720 --> 00:08:28,320
change however warm or widespread the medieval warm period happened to be. According to a study

97
00:08:28,320 --> 00:08:34,160
in 2008, if tree ring proxies are included in a reconstruction, the last decade of the northern

98
00:08:34,160 --> 00:08:39,760
hemisphere has been the warmest for 1700 years. If tree ring proxies aren't used, we're in the

99
00:08:39,760 --> 00:08:45,520
warmest period for 1300 years. The link between carbon dioxide and the recent rise in global

100
00:08:45,520 --> 00:08:51,440
temperatures isn't affected either way. An independent inquiry will now examine the emails

101
00:08:51,440 --> 00:08:55,680
including serious allegations that some were destroyed while subject to a freedom of

102
00:08:55,680 --> 00:09:01,200
information request. But conspiracy theorists shouldn't expect reality to match the hype of

103
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:06,720
talk radio. Even if you erased all the reconstructions, the link between carbon dioxide and

104
00:09:06,720 --> 00:09:12,000
global temperature would be unaffected. And if you think a different shaped graph would undermine the

105
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:18,000
idea that the earth is doomed or the human race faces extinction, well it won't do that either.

106
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:21,280
Because none of this is in the scientific literature in the first place.
