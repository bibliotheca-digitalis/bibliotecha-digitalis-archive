0	3440	In my last video I looked at a couple of emails that have been held up as
3440	9520	Exhibit A for fudging climate data, and as we saw it's not quite as simple as that.
9520	13600	This goes for the other area I said I'd be happy to look at, which is the contention
13600	18640	that the emailers were trying to stifle scientific debate and block alternative ideas.
19440	23600	First, let me clear up any misunderstanding about how these papers get published
23600	29200	and especially the process of peer review. It's a system that's been around for over 200 years,
29280	32960	and its purpose is to keep bad research out of the scientific literature.
33680	38880	Referees look through submitted papers for obvious mistakes and flaws in methodology,
38880	44400	and advise the editor of the journal accordingly. Papers are excluded if the mistakes and flaws are
44400	50480	very obvious. A paper should not be excluded simply because a referee or an editor disagrees
50480	56320	with its contents or its conclusions. The question is, did the emailers want to keep papers from
56320	61120	being published because they disagreed with them, or because the papers were full of basic errors?
61840	66960	The assumption among conspiracy theorists is the former. The rationale the emailers themselves
66960	72240	give is that the research is crap, and we even see them rebutting privately and publicly what
72240	76400	they deem to be crap coming from their own colleagues who support climate change.
77200	82000	I couldn't find one comment about wanting to keep a paper out because it highlights flaws
82000	86640	in the climate change model. Of course the emailers could be lying, but if they're part
86640	92400	of a conspiracy and communicating privately, why would they lie to each other? Here's an email
92400	97680	that's been held up in the media and on skeptic blogs as a prime example. I didn't cherry pick
97680	102800	this, it's been cherry picked by hundreds of blogs and media commentators out of a thousand emails
102800	108080	that had already been cherry picked. So if you think I shouldn't be talking about it, blame them,
108080	113200	not me. It refers to boycotting the journal Climate Research, following the publication
113200	120000	of a 2003 paper by climate skeptics Willie Soon and Sally Baliunas. At first sight it seems like
120000	124880	a very clumsy attempt at censoring a paper that didn't conform to the consensus model.
125440	131120	But let's look at some of the background. Their work wasn't original research, it was a review of
131120	137200	around 240 previously published studies. They looked at climate proxy records such as tree
137200	142240	rings, lake sediments and ice cores over the last thousand years and concluded that overall
142240	147600	the 20th century doesn't contain the warmest anomaly of the past millennium. The problem
147600	152800	with the paper wasn't that it contained mistakes and the methodology was flawed. A lot of papers
152800	158000	get published and then mistakes and flaws are found afterwards. The problem was that the mistakes
158000	163680	were so obvious and the methodology so clearly flawed, climatologists say the paper should never
163680	168480	have been published in the first place. Even authors of the papers being cited as source
168480	174000	material objected to the way their work was misinterpreted. One problem may have been that
174000	179840	Soon and Baliunas, who were astrophysicists, were looking at things like tree ring data with little
179840	185360	knowledge or expertise in that field. A number of climatologists later critiqued the study.
185360	190160	They found that Soon and Baliunas had confused tree ring growth due to warmth with tree ring
190160	194720	growth due to rainfall. They had compared historical proxies with average temperatures
194720	199760	for the 20th century as a whole, instead of the late 20th century, which is the period of
199760	204960	anomalous warming. They had assumed that local variations in temperature could be interpreted
204960	209920	as global variations. If this had been an undergraduate paper, it would have been returned
209920	216160	with an F. Soon and Baliunas' paper was so bad that half the editorial board of the journal
216160	221280	Climate Research resigned after one of the editors was refused permission to publish an
221280	227040	editorial pointing out the mistakes. This is some of the background and context that's missing,
227040	230960	from the line that Phil Jones and his colleagues were threatening to boycott the journal
230960	236880	because they wanted to stifle alternative views. Scientific journals aren't like books or news
236880	242160	magazines. Their purpose isn't to give unsubstantiated opinions or stir up controversy
242160	247280	or spark debate. They're supposed to document observations and give conclusions that are
247280	252480	consistent with those observations. Once a paper is published, it can be legitimately used to
252480	258080	support future papers. It's impossible to keep all flawed research out of the scientific literature
258080	263280	because, as I said, sometimes the flaws aren't found until after publications. But if the
263280	268000	mistakes are blindingly obvious, then there's absolutely no excuse for publishing them.
268720	273840	What concerned me when I saw these emails wasn't that the email is objected to crappy papers being
273840	278480	published in reputable journals. I expect scientists in any field would be similarly
278480	283440	opposed. What concerned me was that they might also be trying to keep out well-written
283440	287200	scientific papers simply because they didn't conform to the consensus.
287840	291920	If you've watched my climate change series from the beginning, you'll know my position.
292480	296720	I'm very much in favour of publishing well-researched studies that challenge the
296720	301680	climate change model. Challengers force scientists to test their evidence and oblige
301680	306480	them to look at alternative explanations. So throughout my climate change series,
306480	311120	I've highlighted alternative models that have been proposed by thoughtful researchers like
311120	317040	Egel Fries Christensen and Nia Shaviv. But while problems have been found with these models,
317040	322560	they certainly don't fall under the category of grade F papers. As far as I know, no one has
322560	328400	bothered to check whether these better quality papers have been similarly opposed. It's not hard.
328400	333840	I simply word-searched Christi, Weser, Shaviv, Lindsen, Svensmark and Fries Christensen,
333840	337680	sceptics who know their stuff and who've written important papers challenging
337680	342720	anthropogenic climate change. Given the importance and influence of their research,
342720	347120	you would have thought they'd be talked about endlessly in these emails over the last 13 years.
347840	352880	And if this is a conspiracy, then a lot of that talk would surely be about blocking their papers
352880	358720	from the scientific literature. But I found only one polite reference to Svensmark and no
358720	364400	references at all to Weser, Shaviv and Fries Christensen. No doubt they were talked about,
364400	369280	but the talk didn't make it into the list of 1000 emails guiding us towards a conspiracy.
369840	374640	John Christi was mentioned many times because he was in regular correspondence with the Climatic
374640	380720	Research Unit. Richard Lindsen's papers came in for a lot of criticism, including a point-by-point
380720	386560	scientific rebuttal by Kevin Trenberth. But there was no talk of trying to block his papers.
386560	392160	The closest I got was this email from Phil Jones, which refers to passages by Lindsen in a US
392160	398080	climate change science programme study. In 13 years of emails, I couldn't find any talk of
398080	404240	blocking any papers written by any of these prominent sceptics. So let me repeat what I
404240	408880	said in the first video. This doesn't mean there was no skullduggery. It doesn't mean there was
408880	414720	no rejection of papers on spurious grounds, no fudging of data. But simply reading out these
414720	420240	emails and yelling fraud tells us nothing. They all need to be properly investigated.
420880	425280	Finally, let me clear up a persistent misunderstanding about tree ring data.
425280	430080	We can measure global temperatures quite easily in the industrial era with thermometers and other
430080	436400	devices. But pre-record temperatures are measured by other means, things like tree rings, ice cores,
436400	442320	lake bed sediments and coral. But tree rings present a particular problem. Generally, they're
442320	448000	wider when it's warm and narrower when it's cool. Tree ring data fit reasonably well with all the
448000	454000	other proxy temperature data. But about 50 years ago, temperatures indicated by tree ring data
454000	458080	in some trees began to diverge from temperatures recorded by thermometers.
458640	463520	While modern instruments show the earth has been warming over the last 50 years, the tree ring data
463520	469200	suggests it was cooling. Even sceptics don't doubt that the instruments are right and the tree ring
469200	475360	data are wrong. We know the earth's been warming and not cooling. Skeptics argue that the divergence
475360	481520	means tree rings can't be trusted as a proxy and shouldn't be used. Proponents argue that recent
481520	486640	tree ring growth has been influenced by post-war industrialisation and since it correlates well
486640	492080	prior to that, it should be used. So much fuss is made of this, you'd think it was a central
492080	497600	pillar of the theory of climate change. It isn't. The link between carbon dioxide and global
497600	502720	temperatures was established before Phil Jones and his colleagues were even born. And that won't
502720	508320	change however warm or widespread the medieval warm period happened to be. According to a study
508320	514160	in 2008, if tree ring proxies are included in a reconstruction, the last decade of the northern
514160	519760	hemisphere has been the warmest for 1700 years. If tree ring proxies aren't used, we're in the
519760	525520	warmest period for 1300 years. The link between carbon dioxide and the recent rise in global
525520	531440	temperatures isn't affected either way. An independent inquiry will now examine the emails
531440	535680	including serious allegations that some were destroyed while subject to a freedom of
535680	541200	information request. But conspiracy theorists shouldn't expect reality to match the hype of
541200	546720	talk radio. Even if you erased all the reconstructions, the link between carbon dioxide and
546720	552000	global temperature would be unaffected. And if you think a different shaped graph would undermine the
552000	558000	idea that the earth is doomed or the human race faces extinction, well it won't do that either.
558000	561280	Because none of this is in the scientific literature in the first place.
