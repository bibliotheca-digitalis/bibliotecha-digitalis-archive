00:00.000 --> 00:03.440
In my last video I looked at a couple of emails that have been held up as

00:03.440 --> 00:09.520
Exhibit A for fudging climate data, and as we saw it's not quite as simple as that.

00:09.520 --> 00:13.600
This goes for the other area I said I'd be happy to look at, which is the contention

00:13.600 --> 00:18.640
that the emailers were trying to stifle scientific debate and block alternative ideas.

00:19.440 --> 00:23.600
First, let me clear up any misunderstanding about how these papers get published

00:23.600 --> 00:29.200
and especially the process of peer review. It's a system that's been around for over 200 years,

00:29.280 --> 00:32.960
and its purpose is to keep bad research out of the scientific literature.

00:33.680 --> 00:38.880
Referees look through submitted papers for obvious mistakes and flaws in methodology,

00:38.880 --> 00:44.400
and advise the editor of the journal accordingly. Papers are excluded if the mistakes and flaws are

00:44.400 --> 00:50.480
very obvious. A paper should not be excluded simply because a referee or an editor disagrees

00:50.480 --> 00:56.320
with its contents or its conclusions. The question is, did the emailers want to keep papers from

00:56.320 --> 01:01.120
being published because they disagreed with them, or because the papers were full of basic errors?

01:01.840 --> 01:06.960
The assumption among conspiracy theorists is the former. The rationale the emailers themselves

01:06.960 --> 01:12.240
give is that the research is crap, and we even see them rebutting privately and publicly what

01:12.240 --> 01:16.400
they deem to be crap coming from their own colleagues who support climate change.

01:17.200 --> 01:22.000
I couldn't find one comment about wanting to keep a paper out because it highlights flaws

01:22.000 --> 01:26.640
in the climate change model. Of course the emailers could be lying, but if they're part

01:26.640 --> 01:32.400
of a conspiracy and communicating privately, why would they lie to each other? Here's an email

01:32.400 --> 01:37.680
that's been held up in the media and on skeptic blogs as a prime example. I didn't cherry pick

01:37.680 --> 01:42.800
this, it's been cherry picked by hundreds of blogs and media commentators out of a thousand emails

01:42.800 --> 01:48.080
that had already been cherry picked. So if you think I shouldn't be talking about it, blame them,

01:48.080 --> 01:53.200
not me. It refers to boycotting the journal Climate Research, following the publication

01:53.200 --> 02:00.000
of a 2003 paper by climate skeptics Willie Soon and Sally Baliunas. At first sight it seems like

02:00.000 --> 02:04.880
a very clumsy attempt at censoring a paper that didn't conform to the consensus model.

02:05.440 --> 02:11.120
But let's look at some of the background. Their work wasn't original research, it was a review of

02:11.120 --> 02:17.200
around 240 previously published studies. They looked at climate proxy records such as tree

02:17.200 --> 02:22.240
rings, lake sediments and ice cores over the last thousand years and concluded that overall

02:22.240 --> 02:27.600
the 20th century doesn't contain the warmest anomaly of the past millennium. The problem

02:27.600 --> 02:32.800
with the paper wasn't that it contained mistakes and the methodology was flawed. A lot of papers

02:32.800 --> 02:38.000
get published and then mistakes and flaws are found afterwards. The problem was that the mistakes

02:38.000 --> 02:43.680
were so obvious and the methodology so clearly flawed, climatologists say the paper should never

02:43.680 --> 02:48.480
have been published in the first place. Even authors of the papers being cited as source

02:48.480 --> 02:54.000
material objected to the way their work was misinterpreted. One problem may have been that

02:54.000 --> 02:59.840
Soon and Baliunas, who were astrophysicists, were looking at things like tree ring data with little

02:59.840 --> 03:05.360
knowledge or expertise in that field. A number of climatologists later critiqued the study.

03:05.360 --> 03:10.160
They found that Soon and Baliunas had confused tree ring growth due to warmth with tree ring

03:10.160 --> 03:14.720
growth due to rainfall. They had compared historical proxies with average temperatures

03:14.720 --> 03:19.760
for the 20th century as a whole, instead of the late 20th century, which is the period of

03:19.760 --> 03:24.960
anomalous warming. They had assumed that local variations in temperature could be interpreted

03:24.960 --> 03:29.920
as global variations. If this had been an undergraduate paper, it would have been returned

03:29.920 --> 03:36.160
with an F. Soon and Baliunas' paper was so bad that half the editorial board of the journal

03:36.160 --> 03:41.280
Climate Research resigned after one of the editors was refused permission to publish an

03:41.280 --> 03:47.040
editorial pointing out the mistakes. This is some of the background and context that's missing,

03:47.040 --> 03:50.960
from the line that Phil Jones and his colleagues were threatening to boycott the journal

03:50.960 --> 03:56.880
because they wanted to stifle alternative views. Scientific journals aren't like books or news

03:56.880 --> 04:02.160
magazines. Their purpose isn't to give unsubstantiated opinions or stir up controversy

04:02.160 --> 04:07.280
or spark debate. They're supposed to document observations and give conclusions that are

04:07.280 --> 04:12.480
consistent with those observations. Once a paper is published, it can be legitimately used to

04:12.480 --> 04:18.080
support future papers. It's impossible to keep all flawed research out of the scientific literature

04:18.080 --> 04:23.280
because, as I said, sometimes the flaws aren't found until after publications. But if the

04:23.280 --> 04:28.000
mistakes are blindingly obvious, then there's absolutely no excuse for publishing them.

04:28.720 --> 04:33.840
What concerned me when I saw these emails wasn't that the email is objected to crappy papers being

04:33.840 --> 04:38.480
published in reputable journals. I expect scientists in any field would be similarly

04:38.480 --> 04:43.440
opposed. What concerned me was that they might also be trying to keep out well-written

04:43.440 --> 04:47.200
scientific papers simply because they didn't conform to the consensus.

04:47.840 --> 04:51.920
If you've watched my climate change series from the beginning, you'll know my position.

04:52.480 --> 04:56.720
I'm very much in favour of publishing well-researched studies that challenge the

04:56.720 --> 05:01.680
climate change model. Challengers force scientists to test their evidence and oblige

05:01.680 --> 05:06.480
them to look at alternative explanations. So throughout my climate change series,

05:06.480 --> 05:11.120
I've highlighted alternative models that have been proposed by thoughtful researchers like

05:11.120 --> 05:17.040
Egel Fries Christensen and Nia Shaviv. But while problems have been found with these models,

05:17.040 --> 05:22.560
they certainly don't fall under the category of grade F papers. As far as I know, no one has

05:22.560 --> 05:28.400
bothered to check whether these better quality papers have been similarly opposed. It's not hard.

05:28.400 --> 05:33.840
I simply word-searched Christi, Weser, Shaviv, Lindsen, Svensmark and Fries Christensen,

05:33.840 --> 05:37.680
sceptics who know their stuff and who've written important papers challenging

05:37.680 --> 05:42.720
anthropogenic climate change. Given the importance and influence of their research,

05:42.720 --> 05:47.120
you would have thought they'd be talked about endlessly in these emails over the last 13 years.

05:47.840 --> 05:52.880
And if this is a conspiracy, then a lot of that talk would surely be about blocking their papers

05:52.880 --> 05:58.720
from the scientific literature. But I found only one polite reference to Svensmark and no

05:58.720 --> 06:04.400
references at all to Weser, Shaviv and Fries Christensen. No doubt they were talked about,

06:04.400 --> 06:09.280
but the talk didn't make it into the list of 1000 emails guiding us towards a conspiracy.

06:09.840 --> 06:14.640
John Christi was mentioned many times because he was in regular correspondence with the Climatic

06:14.640 --> 06:20.720
Research Unit. Richard Lindsen's papers came in for a lot of criticism, including a point-by-point

06:20.720 --> 06:26.560
scientific rebuttal by Kevin Trenberth. But there was no talk of trying to block his papers.

06:26.560 --> 06:32.160
The closest I got was this email from Phil Jones, which refers to passages by Lindsen in a US

06:32.160 --> 06:38.080
climate change science programme study. In 13 years of emails, I couldn't find any talk of

06:38.080 --> 06:44.240
blocking any papers written by any of these prominent sceptics. So let me repeat what I

06:44.240 --> 06:48.880
said in the first video. This doesn't mean there was no skullduggery. It doesn't mean there was

06:48.880 --> 06:54.720
no rejection of papers on spurious grounds, no fudging of data. But simply reading out these

06:54.720 --> 07:00.240
emails and yelling fraud tells us nothing. They all need to be properly investigated.

07:00.880 --> 07:05.280
Finally, let me clear up a persistent misunderstanding about tree ring data.

07:05.280 --> 07:10.080
We can measure global temperatures quite easily in the industrial era with thermometers and other

07:10.080 --> 07:16.400
devices. But pre-record temperatures are measured by other means, things like tree rings, ice cores,

07:16.400 --> 07:22.320
lake bed sediments and coral. But tree rings present a particular problem. Generally, they're

07:22.320 --> 07:28.000
wider when it's warm and narrower when it's cool. Tree ring data fit reasonably well with all the

07:28.000 --> 07:34.000
other proxy temperature data. But about 50 years ago, temperatures indicated by tree ring data

07:34.000 --> 07:38.080
in some trees began to diverge from temperatures recorded by thermometers.

07:38.640 --> 07:43.520
While modern instruments show the earth has been warming over the last 50 years, the tree ring data

07:43.520 --> 07:49.200
suggests it was cooling. Even sceptics don't doubt that the instruments are right and the tree ring

07:49.200 --> 07:55.360
data are wrong. We know the earth's been warming and not cooling. Skeptics argue that the divergence

07:55.360 --> 08:01.520
means tree rings can't be trusted as a proxy and shouldn't be used. Proponents argue that recent

08:01.520 --> 08:06.640
tree ring growth has been influenced by post-war industrialisation and since it correlates well

08:06.640 --> 08:12.080
prior to that, it should be used. So much fuss is made of this, you'd think it was a central

08:12.080 --> 08:17.600
pillar of the theory of climate change. It isn't. The link between carbon dioxide and global

08:17.600 --> 08:22.720
temperatures was established before Phil Jones and his colleagues were even born. And that won't

08:22.720 --> 08:28.320
change however warm or widespread the medieval warm period happened to be. According to a study

08:28.320 --> 08:34.160
in 2008, if tree ring proxies are included in a reconstruction, the last decade of the northern

08:34.160 --> 08:39.760
hemisphere has been the warmest for 1700 years. If tree ring proxies aren't used, we're in the

08:39.760 --> 08:45.520
warmest period for 1300 years. The link between carbon dioxide and the recent rise in global

08:45.520 --> 08:51.440
temperatures isn't affected either way. An independent inquiry will now examine the emails

08:51.440 --> 08:55.680
including serious allegations that some were destroyed while subject to a freedom of

08:55.680 --> 09:01.200
information request. But conspiracy theorists shouldn't expect reality to match the hype of

09:01.200 --> 09:06.720
talk radio. Even if you erased all the reconstructions, the link between carbon dioxide and

09:06.720 --> 09:12.000
global temperature would be unaffected. And if you think a different shaped graph would undermine the

09:12.000 --> 09:18.000
idea that the earth is doomed or the human race faces extinction, well it won't do that either.

09:18.000 --> 09:21.280
Because none of this is in the scientific literature in the first place.
