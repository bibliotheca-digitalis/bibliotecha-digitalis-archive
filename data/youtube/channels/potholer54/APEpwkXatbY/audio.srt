00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
My name's Kent Hovind. I was a high school science teacher for 15 years.

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:12,000
OK, you're right. I couldn't do any video about creationist bullshit without including scientist Dr Kent Hovind.

3
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:15,000
Here's a clip I played in my introduction to the series.

4
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:21,000
If you date a sample of known age, I mean, you know how old it is, like a tree ring. Carbon dating doesn't work.

5
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:26,000
It's interesting that Hovind admits that dendrochronology, tree ring dating, works.

6
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:31,000
Dendrochronologists have managed to date trees back 10,000 years using this method,

7
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:36,000
which doesn't quite gel with Hovind's belief that the Earth is only 6,500 years old.

8
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:39,000
Never mind. It's this claim I want to focus on.

9
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:45,000
If you date a sample of known age, I mean, you know how old it is, like a tree ring. Carbon dating doesn't work.

10
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:51,000
But of course it works. It's been done. It was done for the first time as far back as 1949.

11
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:57,000
Samples of known age were carbon dated in blind tests, and the results confirmed the known age.

12
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:02,000
If this didn't happen, then carbon dating would be useless, and it wouldn't be used.

13
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:09,000
For an explanation of how carbon dating works, see my video The Age of Our World Made Easy on the Pothola54 channel.

14
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:17,000
Hovind won't put his money where his mouth is and send a sample of known age to a testing lab to prove that carbon dating doesn't work.

15
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:21,000
Well, maybe he did, and he prefers to keep the results secret.

16
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:27,000
Or maybe he knows it's already been done and prefers to spout yet another Hovind lie to the gullible masses.

17
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:31,000
Hovind has learned that it's far easier to cloud the issue with nonsense like this.

18
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:39,000
A living mollusk shell carbon dated at 2,300 years old. Well, here we are 14 years later, carbon dating is still not working.

19
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:47,000
Hovind doesn't mention the title of the paper he cites here. It's called Radiocarbon dating, fictitious results with mollusk shells.

20
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:55,000
As the title implies, what they were trying to show in their paper is that carbon dating doesn't work under certain circumstances.

21
00:01:55,000 --> 00:02:08,000
They state that right up front in the abstract. Evidence is presented to show that modern mollusk shells from rivers can have anomalous radiocarbon ages, owing mainly to the incorporation of inactive carbon from humus.

22
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:12,000
This is now known as the reservoir effect and it's well understood.

23
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:19,000
Animals that feed on the bottom of rivers, lakes and oceans aren't getting their carbon from the air, as most plants do.

24
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:24,000
The carbon has been filtered down and sometimes even dissolved from carbon based rocks.

25
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:31,000
So the carbon-14 content is greatly reduced. Any sample taken for carbon dating will give a false reading.

26
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:37,000
Back in 1963, Keith and Anderson were among the first to alert biologists to this problem.

27
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:44,000
The whole purpose of their paper was to warn biologists that carbon dating doesn't work under certain circumstances.

28
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:52,000
It was very easy then for Hovind to turn that prescient warning into this, and of course gullible audiences believe it.

29
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:57,000
Carbon dating indicated live snails had died 27,000 years before.

30
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:04,000
And if it's not snails that make their way around the creationist urban myth factory, it's a 1300 year old seal.

31
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:10,000
A freshly killed seal carbon dated at 1300 years old. Still not working folks.

32
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:16,000
It took a while to track this down because Hovind doesn't give us the title of the paper or the author.

33
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:23,000
But the paper referred to seems to be this one, written by Wakefield Dort, then geology professor at the University of Kansas.

34
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:33,000
And just like Keith and Anderson, Dort mentions the 1300 year old carbon dating result as a warning that carbon dates are inaccurate in marine organisms.

35
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:38,000
And of course we know why. Once again, this is the reservoir effect.

36
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:41,000
Other limitations of carbon dating have also been found.

37
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:49,000
A very obvious one is the water around Antarctica, which began its life thousands of years earlier in the North Atlantic and North Pacific.

38
00:03:49,000 --> 00:04:00,000
As it journeys south, a lot of the dissolved carbon-14 is depleted, so any carbon that ends up in the food chain around Antarctica will give animals that ingest it a greater apparent age.

39
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:04,000
And guess who jumped on this as proof that carbon dating doesn't work.

40
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:07,000
Living penguins date 8000 years old.

41
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:11,000
So carbon dating isn't a one size fits all method of analysis.

42
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:16,000
It works best on organisms like plants that draw their carbon directly from the atmosphere.

43
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:25,000
It's less effective on animals that ingest the plants and it works extremely badly on animals that are ingesting carbon from marine environments.

44
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:34,000
But Hovind's obsession with carbon dating is a bit bizarre, because carbon dating isn't very useful in dating fossils or the age of the Earth.

45
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:45,000
As I explained in The Age of Our World Made Easy, carbon-14 has a half-life of around 5000 years, so it's only used to date carbon-based material less than 60,000 years old.

46
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:51,000
Hovind, who claims to be a scientist, gives us an inkling that he sort of understands this.

47
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:53,000
This is a dinosaur bone, by the way. It's been replaced by minerals.

48
00:04:54,000 --> 00:05:00,000
Whoa, hold on. Before you get to the but, did I just hear you say, it's been replaced by minerals?

49
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,000
So in fact, there's no carbon in it.

50
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:08,000
And this would seem to be rather a crucial requirement if you want to perform carbon dating.

51
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:09,000
Minor point, apparently.

52
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:13,000
They start with the assumption that dinosaurs lived 70 million years ago.

53
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:20,000
If I took this to a laboratory and said, would you please date this, they would say, oh well, we'd have to use something other than carbon dating because this is too old for carbon dating.

54
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:22,000
No, Ken, they wouldn't. They'd say,

55
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:27,000
Oi, Hovind, we can't carbon date this. There's no fucking carbon in it.

56
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:32,000
And didn't you say the same thing yourself just a minute ago? It's been replaced by minerals.

57
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:41,000
Now you would have thought that an absence of carbon would dissuade even the dumbest creationist from taking a completely mineralized fossil to be carbon dated in a laboratory.

58
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:43,000
And you'd be wrong.

59
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:49,000
Hugh Miller in Columbus, Ohio had four dinosaur bone samples carbon dated. They told him they were 20,000 years old.

60
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:58,000
He didn't tell them they were dinosaur bones. If he would have said, this is a dinosaur bone and I want you to carbon date it, they would have said, oh, we can't date that because it's too old.

61
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:05,000
No, they would have said, Oi, Miller, we can't carbon date that, you idiot. There's no fucking carbon in it.

62
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:09,000
So if there's no carbon in it, how come it dated to 20,000 years old?

63
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:16,000
Well, we now have to tell the Millers tale, as told by Mike Lafferty, science correspondent for the Columbus Dispatch.

64
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:23,000
In 1991, he tracked down the place where Miller had got his dinosaur sample, the Carnegie Museum of Natural History.

65
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:32,000
Miller didn't tell them he was going to carbon date these pieces of mineralized fossil because if he had, they'd have said to him, there's no fucking carbon in it.

66
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:39,000
So he did something completely out of character for a creationist and didn't come clean about what he wanted to do with the sample.

67
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:45,000
Unaware that his precious bone specimen was about to be destroyed in a pointless exercise for the creationist cause,

68
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:53,000
James King, the director of the Carnegie Museum, warned Miller that the bones had been covered with shellac and other unknown preservatives.

69
00:06:53,000 --> 00:07:03,000
Shellac, of course, is an organic material chock full of carbon. To a real chemist preparing to carbon date a sample, this would have rung alarm bells about the danger of contamination.

70
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:11,000
But not Miller. He sent his samples to the University of Arizona's Laboratory of Isotope Geochemistry for carbon dating.

71
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:23,000
Then a second alarm bell was sounded. Austin Long, professor of geochemistry at the University of Arizona, told Miller that there was no collagen in the bones and therefore no carbon.

72
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:27,000
But Long said, there is a lot of carbon in the shellac.

73
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:36,000
Look, Miller, do you need this spelt out? If you carbon date this sample, you won't get a date for the fossil, because there's no fucking carbon in it!

74
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:40,000
You'll get a date for the preservative, and that's exactly what he got.

75
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:45,000
Carbon dating also popped up in this video, which was nominated for a Golden Crocoduck.

76
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:52,000
Hello YouTubers, Big Jerry here, ready for round two of answering an evolutionist and atheist's questions.

77
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:56,000
I have to be quite strict about the criteria and say it doesn't qualify.

78
00:07:56,000 --> 00:08:03,000
Big Jerry's video is a bit like a sitcom pilot for NBC, an answer guy who doesn't actually have any answers.

79
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:09,000
So you may think I'm simply putting him in here for a bit of comic relief, but I'd say, yeah.

80
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:17,000
Number nine, how do you explain carbon dating and radiometric dating showing the Earth not as 6000 years old, but billions of years old?

81
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:21,000
Now this is another one of those I actually had to stop what I was doing and do some research on.

82
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:28,000
A lot of it I already knew, but I just thought I'd read some of this stuff off for you, because a lot of it is actually pretty interesting.

83
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:34,000
Honestly, I don't trust radiometric and carbon dating at all.

84
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:40,000
But bear with me here, here's a little article from an article.

85
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:47,000
When a date differs from that expected, researchers readily invent excuses for rejecting the result.

86
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:52,000
The common application of such posterior reasoning shows that radiometric dating has serious problems.

87
00:08:52,000 --> 00:09:03,000
Now I'm not doubting Big Jerry's abilities as the answer guy, but it seems that the extent of his research is simply to type in the words radiometric dating into ChristianAnswers.net

88
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:08,000
and then read whatever it says off the screen without necessarily understanding it.

89
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:09,000
Am I right?

90
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:29,000
The authors decided that was too old according to their beliefs about the place of the fossils in the evolutionary grand scheme of things, so they looked at some basalt further removed from the fossils and selected 17 of 26 samples to get an acceptable maximum age of 4.4 million years.

91
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:41,000
That's all the time I have for this edition of Answering an Evolutionist. Hope you all stick around with me for part 3. Be back soon.
