0	5000	My name's Kent Hovind. I was a high school science teacher for 15 years.
5000	12000	OK, you're right. I couldn't do any video about creationist bullshit without including scientist Dr Kent Hovind.
12000	15000	Here's a clip I played in my introduction to the series.
15000	21000	If you date a sample of known age, I mean, you know how old it is, like a tree ring. Carbon dating doesn't work.
21000	26000	It's interesting that Hovind admits that dendrochronology, tree ring dating, works.
26000	31000	Dendrochronologists have managed to date trees back 10,000 years using this method,
31000	36000	which doesn't quite gel with Hovind's belief that the Earth is only 6,500 years old.
36000	39000	Never mind. It's this claim I want to focus on.
39000	45000	If you date a sample of known age, I mean, you know how old it is, like a tree ring. Carbon dating doesn't work.
45000	51000	But of course it works. It's been done. It was done for the first time as far back as 1949.
51000	57000	Samples of known age were carbon dated in blind tests, and the results confirmed the known age.
57000	62000	If this didn't happen, then carbon dating would be useless, and it wouldn't be used.
62000	69000	For an explanation of how carbon dating works, see my video The Age of Our World Made Easy on the Pothola54 channel.
69000	77000	Hovind won't put his money where his mouth is and send a sample of known age to a testing lab to prove that carbon dating doesn't work.
77000	81000	Well, maybe he did, and he prefers to keep the results secret.
81000	87000	Or maybe he knows it's already been done and prefers to spout yet another Hovind lie to the gullible masses.
87000	91000	Hovind has learned that it's far easier to cloud the issue with nonsense like this.
91000	99000	A living mollusk shell carbon dated at 2,300 years old. Well, here we are 14 years later, carbon dating is still not working.
99000	107000	Hovind doesn't mention the title of the paper he cites here. It's called Radiocarbon dating, fictitious results with mollusk shells.
107000	115000	As the title implies, what they were trying to show in their paper is that carbon dating doesn't work under certain circumstances.
115000	128000	They state that right up front in the abstract. Evidence is presented to show that modern mollusk shells from rivers can have anomalous radiocarbon ages, owing mainly to the incorporation of inactive carbon from humus.
128000	132000	This is now known as the reservoir effect and it's well understood.
132000	139000	Animals that feed on the bottom of rivers, lakes and oceans aren't getting their carbon from the air, as most plants do.
139000	144000	The carbon has been filtered down and sometimes even dissolved from carbon based rocks.
144000	151000	So the carbon-14 content is greatly reduced. Any sample taken for carbon dating will give a false reading.
151000	157000	Back in 1963, Keith and Anderson were among the first to alert biologists to this problem.
157000	164000	The whole purpose of their paper was to warn biologists that carbon dating doesn't work under certain circumstances.
164000	172000	It was very easy then for Hovind to turn that prescient warning into this, and of course gullible audiences believe it.
172000	177000	Carbon dating indicated live snails had died 27,000 years before.
177000	184000	And if it's not snails that make their way around the creationist urban myth factory, it's a 1300 year old seal.
185000	190000	A freshly killed seal carbon dated at 1300 years old. Still not working folks.
190000	196000	It took a while to track this down because Hovind doesn't give us the title of the paper or the author.
196000	203000	But the paper referred to seems to be this one, written by Wakefield Dort, then geology professor at the University of Kansas.
203000	213000	And just like Keith and Anderson, Dort mentions the 1300 year old carbon dating result as a warning that carbon dates are inaccurate in marine organisms.
213000	218000	And of course we know why. Once again, this is the reservoir effect.
218000	221000	Other limitations of carbon dating have also been found.
221000	229000	A very obvious one is the water around Antarctica, which began its life thousands of years earlier in the North Atlantic and North Pacific.
229000	240000	As it journeys south, a lot of the dissolved carbon-14 is depleted, so any carbon that ends up in the food chain around Antarctica will give animals that ingest it a greater apparent age.
240000	244000	And guess who jumped on this as proof that carbon dating doesn't work.
244000	247000	Living penguins date 8000 years old.
247000	251000	So carbon dating isn't a one size fits all method of analysis.
251000	256000	It works best on organisms like plants that draw their carbon directly from the atmosphere.
256000	265000	It's less effective on animals that ingest the plants and it works extremely badly on animals that are ingesting carbon from marine environments.
265000	274000	But Hovind's obsession with carbon dating is a bit bizarre, because carbon dating isn't very useful in dating fossils or the age of the Earth.
274000	285000	As I explained in The Age of Our World Made Easy, carbon-14 has a half-life of around 5000 years, so it's only used to date carbon-based material less than 60,000 years old.
285000	291000	Hovind, who claims to be a scientist, gives us an inkling that he sort of understands this.
291000	293000	This is a dinosaur bone, by the way. It's been replaced by minerals.
294000	300000	Whoa, hold on. Before you get to the but, did I just hear you say, it's been replaced by minerals?
300000	302000	So in fact, there's no carbon in it.
302000	308000	And this would seem to be rather a crucial requirement if you want to perform carbon dating.
308000	309000	Minor point, apparently.
309000	313000	They start with the assumption that dinosaurs lived 70 million years ago.
313000	320000	If I took this to a laboratory and said, would you please date this, they would say, oh well, we'd have to use something other than carbon dating because this is too old for carbon dating.
320000	322000	No, Ken, they wouldn't. They'd say,
322000	327000	Oi, Hovind, we can't carbon date this. There's no fucking carbon in it.
327000	332000	And didn't you say the same thing yourself just a minute ago? It's been replaced by minerals.
332000	341000	Now you would have thought that an absence of carbon would dissuade even the dumbest creationist from taking a completely mineralized fossil to be carbon dated in a laboratory.
341000	343000	And you'd be wrong.
343000	349000	Hugh Miller in Columbus, Ohio had four dinosaur bone samples carbon dated. They told him they were 20,000 years old.
349000	358000	He didn't tell them they were dinosaur bones. If he would have said, this is a dinosaur bone and I want you to carbon date it, they would have said, oh, we can't date that because it's too old.
358000	365000	No, they would have said, Oi, Miller, we can't carbon date that, you idiot. There's no fucking carbon in it.
365000	369000	So if there's no carbon in it, how come it dated to 20,000 years old?
369000	376000	Well, we now have to tell the Millers tale, as told by Mike Lafferty, science correspondent for the Columbus Dispatch.
376000	383000	In 1991, he tracked down the place where Miller had got his dinosaur sample, the Carnegie Museum of Natural History.
383000	392000	Miller didn't tell them he was going to carbon date these pieces of mineralized fossil because if he had, they'd have said to him, there's no fucking carbon in it.
392000	399000	So he did something completely out of character for a creationist and didn't come clean about what he wanted to do with the sample.
399000	405000	Unaware that his precious bone specimen was about to be destroyed in a pointless exercise for the creationist cause,
405000	413000	James King, the director of the Carnegie Museum, warned Miller that the bones had been covered with shellac and other unknown preservatives.
413000	423000	Shellac, of course, is an organic material chock full of carbon. To a real chemist preparing to carbon date a sample, this would have rung alarm bells about the danger of contamination.
423000	431000	But not Miller. He sent his samples to the University of Arizona's Laboratory of Isotope Geochemistry for carbon dating.
431000	443000	Then a second alarm bell was sounded. Austin Long, professor of geochemistry at the University of Arizona, told Miller that there was no collagen in the bones and therefore no carbon.
443000	447000	But Long said, there is a lot of carbon in the shellac.
447000	456000	Look, Miller, do you need this spelt out? If you carbon date this sample, you won't get a date for the fossil, because there's no fucking carbon in it!
456000	460000	You'll get a date for the preservative, and that's exactly what he got.
460000	465000	Carbon dating also popped up in this video, which was nominated for a Golden Crocoduck.
465000	472000	Hello YouTubers, Big Jerry here, ready for round two of answering an evolutionist and atheist's questions.
472000	476000	I have to be quite strict about the criteria and say it doesn't qualify.
476000	483000	Big Jerry's video is a bit like a sitcom pilot for NBC, an answer guy who doesn't actually have any answers.
483000	489000	So you may think I'm simply putting him in here for a bit of comic relief, but I'd say, yeah.
489000	497000	Number nine, how do you explain carbon dating and radiometric dating showing the Earth not as 6000 years old, but billions of years old?
497000	501000	Now this is another one of those I actually had to stop what I was doing and do some research on.
501000	508000	A lot of it I already knew, but I just thought I'd read some of this stuff off for you, because a lot of it is actually pretty interesting.
508000	514000	Honestly, I don't trust radiometric and carbon dating at all.
514000	520000	But bear with me here, here's a little article from an article.
520000	527000	When a date differs from that expected, researchers readily invent excuses for rejecting the result.
527000	532000	The common application of such posterior reasoning shows that radiometric dating has serious problems.
532000	543000	Now I'm not doubting Big Jerry's abilities as the answer guy, but it seems that the extent of his research is simply to type in the words radiometric dating into ChristianAnswers.net
543000	548000	and then read whatever it says off the screen without necessarily understanding it.
548000	549000	Am I right?
549000	569000	The authors decided that was too old according to their beliefs about the place of the fossils in the evolutionary grand scheme of things, so they looked at some basalt further removed from the fossils and selected 17 of 26 samples to get an acceptable maximum age of 4.4 million years.
569000	581000	That's all the time I have for this edition of Answering an Evolutionist. Hope you all stick around with me for part 3. Be back soon.
