1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:09,080
I think our children have more robust intelligence and questioning to be able to cope with looking

2
00:00:09,080 --> 00:00:15,920
at all the different theories that are out there, looking at all the different theories

3
00:00:15,920 --> 00:00:37,400
that are out there. I agree. I wish there was time for children to learn all the different

4
00:00:37,400 --> 00:00:42,360
theories. They were shaped by extraordinary people who decided to observe the stars,

5
00:00:42,360 --> 00:00:49,080
the rocks, life, heat, light and matter with open minds. They made conclusions based on evidence,

6
00:00:49,080 --> 00:00:54,040
not their religious beliefs. Surely the knowledge they've handed down to us will

7
00:00:54,040 --> 00:01:04,000
never be kept from our children. We have a revelation for the one who says,

8
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:08,040
I know everything. I've always been there. Here's what happened in the past. So when

9
00:01:08,040 --> 00:01:12,800
we take that revelation, put on our set of glasses and we look at the evidence we can say,

10
00:01:12,800 --> 00:01:16,880
ah, now I understand fossils couldn't have formed before sin. There was no death before sin. There

11
00:01:16,880 --> 00:01:25,960
was a global flood that connects to geology. What is the age of the earth? When did the creation

12
00:01:25,960 --> 00:01:32,080
actually occur? And of course, we're going to go to the Bible. How we make advances in science is

13
00:01:32,080 --> 00:01:37,000
being open to all different perspectives. And that's all that we're calling for. Let's qualify

14
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:41,960
that. Fundamentalists don't advocate teaching all of the thousands of different perspectives

15
00:01:41,960 --> 00:01:47,560
that are out there, like the idea that the earth is expanding or that aliens from another planet

16
00:01:47,560 --> 00:01:52,880
helped build the pyramids. What they want is to be able to teach just one different perspective,

17
00:01:52,880 --> 00:01:57,640
and the fundamentalist lobby is running a well-targeted campaign to convince parents,

18
00:01:57,640 --> 00:02:04,640
not just in the United States, but also in other countries, of two things. That creation science

19
00:02:04,680 --> 00:02:10,000
and intelligent design are science, and that there's a real debate about our origins going

20
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:15,400
on within the scientific community. And let's face it, most people don't know that much about

21
00:02:15,400 --> 00:02:22,000
science or about what goes on within the scientific community. So the first thing to recognize and to

22
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:28,480
be honest about is that this has nothing to do with science. We take that revelation, put on our

23
00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:33,900
set of glasses. As I explained in the last video, the scientific method made easy, starting with a

24
00:02:33,900 --> 00:02:38,540
conclusion and then looking for the evidence afterwards, shatters the first golden rule of

25
00:02:38,540 --> 00:02:44,640
science. It's not even the way our courts operate. If you know your conclusion in advance, why even

26
00:02:44,640 --> 00:02:50,620
bother looking at the evidence? Any kind of scientific research becomes futile. This is so

27
00:02:50,620 --> 00:02:56,140
obvious even to non-scientists that advocates of creation science soon realized it wasn't a great

28
00:02:56,140 --> 00:03:01,420
way to break into the science curriculum. So the label was dropped in favor of something that was

29
00:03:01,420 --> 00:03:20,060
much vaguer, but sounded more thoughtful. Intelligent design takes a simple two-step

30
00:03:20,060 --> 00:03:25,340
approach. Find something complicated that we don't yet understand, and conclude that because

31
00:03:25,340 --> 00:03:29,860
we don't understand it, the best explanation is to assume the work of an invisible being,

32
00:03:29,900 --> 00:03:35,860
or to put it in a way that sounds a little more scientific, an intelligent designer. In fact,

33
00:03:35,860 --> 00:03:41,100
researchers who've applied the scientific method to these supposedly intractable problems have

34
00:03:41,100 --> 00:03:46,620
discovered their origins consistent with what we know and understand, even for things that seem to

35
00:03:46,620 --> 00:03:52,940
be very unintelligently designed. But even if they hadn't, this leap from problem to conclusion is

36
00:03:52,940 --> 00:03:59,380
not how science works. As we saw in the last video on the scientific method, real scientists

37
00:03:59,420 --> 00:04:04,820
investigate things we don't understand, however complicated, until they come up with a workable

38
00:04:04,820 --> 00:04:11,620
hypothesis. Based on that hypothesis, they then make a prediction that's rigorously tested. Only

39
00:04:11,620 --> 00:04:18,020
when a hypothesis has been successfully tested can a conclusion be reached. Advocates of intelligent

40
00:04:18,020 --> 00:04:24,340
design aren't prepared to make predictions, let alone test them, so it's not science. Maybe not

41
00:04:24,340 --> 00:04:29,460
even a hypothesis, because intelligent design doesn't explain the process by which organisms

42
00:04:29,460 --> 00:04:35,780
were designed and made. It would be just as useful to say it all happened by magic. So the two sides

43
00:04:35,780 --> 00:04:41,500
of this supposed debate are beginning to look decidedly unequal. The theory of intelligent

44
00:04:41,500 --> 00:04:48,220
design isn't a theory at all, it's an untested idea. And we never include untested ideas in the

45
00:04:48,220 --> 00:04:53,460
school science curriculum, not only because they haven't been reviewed or verified or derived by

46
00:04:53,460 --> 00:04:58,580
the scientific method, but because there are so many untested ideas out there, they'd fill the

47
00:04:58,580 --> 00:05:05,100
entire science curriculum. As for the notion that the scientific community is divided, okay, on one

48
00:05:05,100 --> 00:05:10,700
side we have biologists, including many Christian, Muslim, Jewish and Hindu biologists who accept

49
00:05:10,700 --> 00:05:16,120
evolution, and on the other side we have biologists who believe in intelligent design. So the

50
00:05:16,120 --> 00:05:21,260
scientific community isn't divided over this question at all, there's an overwhelming consensus.

51
00:05:21,260 --> 00:05:26,820
The people who are calling for their ideas to be injected into the science curriculum are outside

52
00:05:26,820 --> 00:05:31,940
the scientific community, and are happy to display a breathtaking ignorance of the subject they're

53
00:05:31,940 --> 00:05:46,980
tackling. Somehow this happened? If Ben Stein is going to disagree with the theory of evolution,

54
00:05:46,980 --> 00:05:52,980
at least he has to understand how it works. People like Stein may have fallen asleep in biology class,

55
00:05:52,980 --> 00:05:58,980
but there's no excuse for denying our children a decent science education, insisting instead that

56
00:05:58,980 --> 00:06:03,820
they dumb down to our level of ignorance. And should we really be telling children that if

57
00:06:03,820 --> 00:06:08,980
they come up against a problem as scientists, they shouldn't try to investigate or resolve it? It's

58
00:06:08,980 --> 00:06:13,740
okay to assume it's the work of an invisible being. How far would that have got us in the

59
00:06:13,740 --> 00:06:20,700
last 500 years? In the 16th century this was a key piece of evidence for intelligent design. There

60
00:06:20,700 --> 00:06:25,660
was simply no way to explain it. How could each colour know where it had to go in the rainbow,

61
00:06:25,660 --> 00:06:31,180
and how did they all know how to form a perfect semicircle together? The only way these colours

62
00:06:31,180 --> 00:06:36,180
could be put into such a perfect and regular pattern is if an intelligent designer was

63
00:06:36,180 --> 00:06:43,420
arranging them. Intelligent design, like creation science, makes scientific research futile, and not

64
00:06:43,420 --> 00:06:49,260
just in the field of biology. Intelligent design advocates like Kent Hovind define evolution as

65
00:06:49,260 --> 00:06:55,060
everything from the unfolding of the universe to the deposition of sedimentary rocks. Cosmology,

66
00:06:55,060 --> 00:07:01,260
geology, physics, archaeology, anything that goes against the literal interpretation of the Bible

67
00:07:01,260 --> 00:07:07,620
is under threat. So the aim of the intelligent design lobby isn't to open minds or look at all

68
00:07:07,620 --> 00:07:13,380
the different perspectives, or both sides of an imaginary scientific debate. The aim is to make

69
00:07:13,380 --> 00:07:18,980
science look murky and indecisive, and cast doubt on theories that are the foundation of our

70
00:07:18,980 --> 00:07:25,300
knowledge. The strengths of science are used against it. The willingness of scientists to

71
00:07:25,300 --> 00:07:30,500
admit errors, correct them, and to modify hypotheses is used as proof that they can

72
00:07:30,500 --> 00:07:35,660
get things wrong. The word theory, the highest form of proof you can get in science short of

73
00:07:35,660 --> 00:07:42,620
mathematics, is mistranslated into uncertainty. Slowly the solid facts established by centuries

74
00:07:42,620 --> 00:07:48,500
of scientific study are eroded. If untested hypotheses are taught alongside verified

75
00:07:48,500 --> 00:07:54,460
theories, we're reducing the idea of science to just a barrow load of ideas, and asking children

76
00:07:54,460 --> 00:08:00,140
to sort out for themselves which are facts based on evidence, and which are conjecture. The result

77
00:08:00,140 --> 00:08:06,100
is confusion, vagueness, and disinterest. We're not opening young minds, we're emptying them.

78
00:08:06,100 --> 00:08:11,620
The intrusion into science teaching threatens a number of countries, but none more so than the

79
00:08:11,620 --> 00:08:17,820
United States. A hundred years ago the USA was admired as a technological powerhouse. In the

80
00:08:17,820 --> 00:08:22,060
technologies of the 20th century, the United States was unsurpassed.

81
00:08:41,620 --> 00:08:47,220
The reality of the 21st century is that new technologies have emerged, and other countries

82
00:08:47,220 --> 00:08:52,100
are catching up. It may be hard to fathom, but children in these countries spend their time in

83
00:08:52,100 --> 00:08:57,580
science class actually learning about science. Teachers don't have to use up valuable time

84
00:08:57,580 --> 00:09:03,400
debating the role of an imaginary designer to placate a religious lobby, or dilute scientific

85
00:09:03,400 --> 00:09:08,780
facts to conform to ancient religious texts. They're already preparing the next generation

86
00:09:08,780 --> 00:09:15,860
of scientists. Are we? Who should you always trust first, God or the scientist? God. God,

87
00:09:15,860 --> 00:09:17,500
and I want you to remember that.
