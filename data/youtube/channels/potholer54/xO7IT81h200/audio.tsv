0	9080	I think our children have more robust intelligence and questioning to be able to cope with looking
9080	15920	at all the different theories that are out there, looking at all the different theories
15920	37400	that are out there. I agree. I wish there was time for children to learn all the different
37400	42360	theories. They were shaped by extraordinary people who decided to observe the stars,
42360	49080	the rocks, life, heat, light and matter with open minds. They made conclusions based on evidence,
49080	54040	not their religious beliefs. Surely the knowledge they've handed down to us will
54040	64000	never be kept from our children. We have a revelation for the one who says,
64000	68040	I know everything. I've always been there. Here's what happened in the past. So when
68040	72800	we take that revelation, put on our set of glasses and we look at the evidence we can say,
72800	76880	ah, now I understand fossils couldn't have formed before sin. There was no death before sin. There
76880	85960	was a global flood that connects to geology. What is the age of the earth? When did the creation
85960	92080	actually occur? And of course, we're going to go to the Bible. How we make advances in science is
92080	97000	being open to all different perspectives. And that's all that we're calling for. Let's qualify
97280	101960	that. Fundamentalists don't advocate teaching all of the thousands of different perspectives
101960	107560	that are out there, like the idea that the earth is expanding or that aliens from another planet
107560	112880	helped build the pyramids. What they want is to be able to teach just one different perspective,
112880	117640	and the fundamentalist lobby is running a well-targeted campaign to convince parents,
117640	124640	not just in the United States, but also in other countries, of two things. That creation science
124680	130000	and intelligent design are science, and that there's a real debate about our origins going
130000	135400	on within the scientific community. And let's face it, most people don't know that much about
135400	142000	science or about what goes on within the scientific community. So the first thing to recognize and to
142000	148480	be honest about is that this has nothing to do with science. We take that revelation, put on our
148480	153900	set of glasses. As I explained in the last video, the scientific method made easy, starting with a
153900	158540	conclusion and then looking for the evidence afterwards, shatters the first golden rule of
158540	164640	science. It's not even the way our courts operate. If you know your conclusion in advance, why even
164640	170620	bother looking at the evidence? Any kind of scientific research becomes futile. This is so
170620	176140	obvious even to non-scientists that advocates of creation science soon realized it wasn't a great
176140	181420	way to break into the science curriculum. So the label was dropped in favor of something that was
181420	200060	much vaguer, but sounded more thoughtful. Intelligent design takes a simple two-step
200060	205340	approach. Find something complicated that we don't yet understand, and conclude that because
205340	209860	we don't understand it, the best explanation is to assume the work of an invisible being,
209900	215860	or to put it in a way that sounds a little more scientific, an intelligent designer. In fact,
215860	221100	researchers who've applied the scientific method to these supposedly intractable problems have
221100	226620	discovered their origins consistent with what we know and understand, even for things that seem to
226620	232940	be very unintelligently designed. But even if they hadn't, this leap from problem to conclusion is
232940	239380	not how science works. As we saw in the last video on the scientific method, real scientists
239420	244820	investigate things we don't understand, however complicated, until they come up with a workable
244820	251620	hypothesis. Based on that hypothesis, they then make a prediction that's rigorously tested. Only
251620	258020	when a hypothesis has been successfully tested can a conclusion be reached. Advocates of intelligent
258020	264340	design aren't prepared to make predictions, let alone test them, so it's not science. Maybe not
264340	269460	even a hypothesis, because intelligent design doesn't explain the process by which organisms
269460	275780	were designed and made. It would be just as useful to say it all happened by magic. So the two sides
275780	281500	of this supposed debate are beginning to look decidedly unequal. The theory of intelligent
281500	288220	design isn't a theory at all, it's an untested idea. And we never include untested ideas in the
288220	293460	school science curriculum, not only because they haven't been reviewed or verified or derived by
293460	298580	the scientific method, but because there are so many untested ideas out there, they'd fill the
298580	305100	entire science curriculum. As for the notion that the scientific community is divided, okay, on one
305100	310700	side we have biologists, including many Christian, Muslim, Jewish and Hindu biologists who accept
310700	316120	evolution, and on the other side we have biologists who believe in intelligent design. So the
316120	321260	scientific community isn't divided over this question at all, there's an overwhelming consensus.
321260	326820	The people who are calling for their ideas to be injected into the science curriculum are outside
326820	331940	the scientific community, and are happy to display a breathtaking ignorance of the subject they're
331940	346980	tackling. Somehow this happened? If Ben Stein is going to disagree with the theory of evolution,
346980	352980	at least he has to understand how it works. People like Stein may have fallen asleep in biology class,
352980	358980	but there's no excuse for denying our children a decent science education, insisting instead that
358980	363820	they dumb down to our level of ignorance. And should we really be telling children that if
363820	368980	they come up against a problem as scientists, they shouldn't try to investigate or resolve it? It's
368980	373740	okay to assume it's the work of an invisible being. How far would that have got us in the
373740	380700	last 500 years? In the 16th century this was a key piece of evidence for intelligent design. There
380700	385660	was simply no way to explain it. How could each colour know where it had to go in the rainbow,
385660	391180	and how did they all know how to form a perfect semicircle together? The only way these colours
391180	396180	could be put into such a perfect and regular pattern is if an intelligent designer was
396180	403420	arranging them. Intelligent design, like creation science, makes scientific research futile, and not
403420	409260	just in the field of biology. Intelligent design advocates like Kent Hovind define evolution as
409260	415060	everything from the unfolding of the universe to the deposition of sedimentary rocks. Cosmology,
415060	421260	geology, physics, archaeology, anything that goes against the literal interpretation of the Bible
421260	427620	is under threat. So the aim of the intelligent design lobby isn't to open minds or look at all
427620	433380	the different perspectives, or both sides of an imaginary scientific debate. The aim is to make
433380	438980	science look murky and indecisive, and cast doubt on theories that are the foundation of our
438980	445300	knowledge. The strengths of science are used against it. The willingness of scientists to
445300	450500	admit errors, correct them, and to modify hypotheses is used as proof that they can
450500	455660	get things wrong. The word theory, the highest form of proof you can get in science short of
455660	462620	mathematics, is mistranslated into uncertainty. Slowly the solid facts established by centuries
462620	468500	of scientific study are eroded. If untested hypotheses are taught alongside verified
468500	474460	theories, we're reducing the idea of science to just a barrow load of ideas, and asking children
474460	480140	to sort out for themselves which are facts based on evidence, and which are conjecture. The result
480140	486100	is confusion, vagueness, and disinterest. We're not opening young minds, we're emptying them.
486100	491620	The intrusion into science teaching threatens a number of countries, but none more so than the
491620	497820	United States. A hundred years ago the USA was admired as a technological powerhouse. In the
497820	502060	technologies of the 20th century, the United States was unsurpassed.
521620	527220	The reality of the 21st century is that new technologies have emerged, and other countries
527220	532100	are catching up. It may be hard to fathom, but children in these countries spend their time in
532100	537580	science class actually learning about science. Teachers don't have to use up valuable time
537580	543400	debating the role of an imaginary designer to placate a religious lobby, or dilute scientific
543400	548780	facts to conform to ancient religious texts. They're already preparing the next generation
548780	555860	of scientists. Are we? Who should you always trust first, God or the scientist? God. God,
555860	557500	and I want you to remember that.
