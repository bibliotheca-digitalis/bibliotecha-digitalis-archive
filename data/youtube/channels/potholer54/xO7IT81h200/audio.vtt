00:00.000 --> 00:09.080
I think our children have more robust intelligence and questioning to be able to cope with looking

00:09.080 --> 00:15.920
at all the different theories that are out there, looking at all the different theories

00:15.920 --> 00:37.400
that are out there. I agree. I wish there was time for children to learn all the different

00:37.400 --> 00:42.360
theories. They were shaped by extraordinary people who decided to observe the stars,

00:42.360 --> 00:49.080
the rocks, life, heat, light and matter with open minds. They made conclusions based on evidence,

00:49.080 --> 00:54.040
not their religious beliefs. Surely the knowledge they've handed down to us will

00:54.040 --> 01:04.000
never be kept from our children. We have a revelation for the one who says,

01:04.000 --> 01:08.040
I know everything. I've always been there. Here's what happened in the past. So when

01:08.040 --> 01:12.800
we take that revelation, put on our set of glasses and we look at the evidence we can say,

01:12.800 --> 01:16.880
ah, now I understand fossils couldn't have formed before sin. There was no death before sin. There

01:16.880 --> 01:25.960
was a global flood that connects to geology. What is the age of the earth? When did the creation

01:25.960 --> 01:32.080
actually occur? And of course, we're going to go to the Bible. How we make advances in science is

01:32.080 --> 01:37.000
being open to all different perspectives. And that's all that we're calling for. Let's qualify

01:37.280 --> 01:41.960
that. Fundamentalists don't advocate teaching all of the thousands of different perspectives

01:41.960 --> 01:47.560
that are out there, like the idea that the earth is expanding or that aliens from another planet

01:47.560 --> 01:52.880
helped build the pyramids. What they want is to be able to teach just one different perspective,

01:52.880 --> 01:57.640
and the fundamentalist lobby is running a well-targeted campaign to convince parents,

01:57.640 --> 02:04.640
not just in the United States, but also in other countries, of two things. That creation science

02:04.680 --> 02:10.000
and intelligent design are science, and that there's a real debate about our origins going

02:10.000 --> 02:15.400
on within the scientific community. And let's face it, most people don't know that much about

02:15.400 --> 02:22.000
science or about what goes on within the scientific community. So the first thing to recognize and to

02:22.000 --> 02:28.480
be honest about is that this has nothing to do with science. We take that revelation, put on our

02:28.480 --> 02:33.900
set of glasses. As I explained in the last video, the scientific method made easy, starting with a

02:33.900 --> 02:38.540
conclusion and then looking for the evidence afterwards, shatters the first golden rule of

02:38.540 --> 02:44.640
science. It's not even the way our courts operate. If you know your conclusion in advance, why even

02:44.640 --> 02:50.620
bother looking at the evidence? Any kind of scientific research becomes futile. This is so

02:50.620 --> 02:56.140
obvious even to non-scientists that advocates of creation science soon realized it wasn't a great

02:56.140 --> 03:01.420
way to break into the science curriculum. So the label was dropped in favor of something that was

03:01.420 --> 03:20.060
much vaguer, but sounded more thoughtful. Intelligent design takes a simple two-step

03:20.060 --> 03:25.340
approach. Find something complicated that we don't yet understand, and conclude that because

03:25.340 --> 03:29.860
we don't understand it, the best explanation is to assume the work of an invisible being,

03:29.900 --> 03:35.860
or to put it in a way that sounds a little more scientific, an intelligent designer. In fact,

03:35.860 --> 03:41.100
researchers who've applied the scientific method to these supposedly intractable problems have

03:41.100 --> 03:46.620
discovered their origins consistent with what we know and understand, even for things that seem to

03:46.620 --> 03:52.940
be very unintelligently designed. But even if they hadn't, this leap from problem to conclusion is

03:52.940 --> 03:59.380
not how science works. As we saw in the last video on the scientific method, real scientists

03:59.420 --> 04:04.820
investigate things we don't understand, however complicated, until they come up with a workable

04:04.820 --> 04:11.620
hypothesis. Based on that hypothesis, they then make a prediction that's rigorously tested. Only

04:11.620 --> 04:18.020
when a hypothesis has been successfully tested can a conclusion be reached. Advocates of intelligent

04:18.020 --> 04:24.340
design aren't prepared to make predictions, let alone test them, so it's not science. Maybe not

04:24.340 --> 04:29.460
even a hypothesis, because intelligent design doesn't explain the process by which organisms

04:29.460 --> 04:35.780
were designed and made. It would be just as useful to say it all happened by magic. So the two sides

04:35.780 --> 04:41.500
of this supposed debate are beginning to look decidedly unequal. The theory of intelligent

04:41.500 --> 04:48.220
design isn't a theory at all, it's an untested idea. And we never include untested ideas in the

04:48.220 --> 04:53.460
school science curriculum, not only because they haven't been reviewed or verified or derived by

04:53.460 --> 04:58.580
the scientific method, but because there are so many untested ideas out there, they'd fill the

04:58.580 --> 05:05.100
entire science curriculum. As for the notion that the scientific community is divided, okay, on one

05:05.100 --> 05:10.700
side we have biologists, including many Christian, Muslim, Jewish and Hindu biologists who accept

05:10.700 --> 05:16.120
evolution, and on the other side we have biologists who believe in intelligent design. So the

05:16.120 --> 05:21.260
scientific community isn't divided over this question at all, there's an overwhelming consensus.

05:21.260 --> 05:26.820
The people who are calling for their ideas to be injected into the science curriculum are outside

05:26.820 --> 05:31.940
the scientific community, and are happy to display a breathtaking ignorance of the subject they're

05:31.940 --> 05:46.980
tackling. Somehow this happened? If Ben Stein is going to disagree with the theory of evolution,

05:46.980 --> 05:52.980
at least he has to understand how it works. People like Stein may have fallen asleep in biology class,

05:52.980 --> 05:58.980
but there's no excuse for denying our children a decent science education, insisting instead that

05:58.980 --> 06:03.820
they dumb down to our level of ignorance. And should we really be telling children that if

06:03.820 --> 06:08.980
they come up against a problem as scientists, they shouldn't try to investigate or resolve it? It's

06:08.980 --> 06:13.740
okay to assume it's the work of an invisible being. How far would that have got us in the

06:13.740 --> 06:20.700
last 500 years? In the 16th century this was a key piece of evidence for intelligent design. There

06:20.700 --> 06:25.660
was simply no way to explain it. How could each colour know where it had to go in the rainbow,

06:25.660 --> 06:31.180
and how did they all know how to form a perfect semicircle together? The only way these colours

06:31.180 --> 06:36.180
could be put into such a perfect and regular pattern is if an intelligent designer was

06:36.180 --> 06:43.420
arranging them. Intelligent design, like creation science, makes scientific research futile, and not

06:43.420 --> 06:49.260
just in the field of biology. Intelligent design advocates like Kent Hovind define evolution as

06:49.260 --> 06:55.060
everything from the unfolding of the universe to the deposition of sedimentary rocks. Cosmology,

06:55.060 --> 07:01.260
geology, physics, archaeology, anything that goes against the literal interpretation of the Bible

07:01.260 --> 07:07.620
is under threat. So the aim of the intelligent design lobby isn't to open minds or look at all

07:07.620 --> 07:13.380
the different perspectives, or both sides of an imaginary scientific debate. The aim is to make

07:13.380 --> 07:18.980
science look murky and indecisive, and cast doubt on theories that are the foundation of our

07:18.980 --> 07:25.300
knowledge. The strengths of science are used against it. The willingness of scientists to

07:25.300 --> 07:30.500
admit errors, correct them, and to modify hypotheses is used as proof that they can

07:30.500 --> 07:35.660
get things wrong. The word theory, the highest form of proof you can get in science short of

07:35.660 --> 07:42.620
mathematics, is mistranslated into uncertainty. Slowly the solid facts established by centuries

07:42.620 --> 07:48.500
of scientific study are eroded. If untested hypotheses are taught alongside verified

07:48.500 --> 07:54.460
theories, we're reducing the idea of science to just a barrow load of ideas, and asking children

07:54.460 --> 08:00.140
to sort out for themselves which are facts based on evidence, and which are conjecture. The result

08:00.140 --> 08:06.100
is confusion, vagueness, and disinterest. We're not opening young minds, we're emptying them.

08:06.100 --> 08:11.620
The intrusion into science teaching threatens a number of countries, but none more so than the

08:11.620 --> 08:17.820
United States. A hundred years ago the USA was admired as a technological powerhouse. In the

08:17.820 --> 08:22.060
technologies of the 20th century, the United States was unsurpassed.

08:41.620 --> 08:47.220
The reality of the 21st century is that new technologies have emerged, and other countries

08:47.220 --> 08:52.100
are catching up. It may be hard to fathom, but children in these countries spend their time in

08:52.100 --> 08:57.580
science class actually learning about science. Teachers don't have to use up valuable time

08:57.580 --> 09:03.400
debating the role of an imaginary designer to placate a religious lobby, or dilute scientific

09:03.400 --> 09:08.780
facts to conform to ancient religious texts. They're already preparing the next generation

09:08.780 --> 09:15.860
of scientists. Are we? Who should you always trust first, God or the scientist? God. God,

09:15.860 --> 09:17.500
and I want you to remember that.
