0	7000	I never thought I would have to actually make a video where I would have to explain that I saw two reptilians.
7000	9000	That I did not account for.
9000	16000	Now I've got to hand it to Chris Constantine. That has to be one of the best opening lines of any video I've ever seen.
16000	19000	It just makes you want to learn more, doesn't it?
19000	28000	So we've got this count of the humans living amongst us who are the Tares, which are basically mini me, Nephilim, and none of us can tell the difference.
28000	38000	Hold on, Chris. I just have to say to anybody out there that if you haven't heard the old I saw someone turn into a reptile kind of story, then you've never spent a Friday evening in a London pub.
38000	44000	So let's listen to Chris's story in a more fitting environment down the local boozer.
47000	51000	There you go, Chris. Quite a bit of it and a pack of crisps.
51000	56000	Now what did I see? Well, I was just coming round the corner in a car...
57000	65000	I saw a guy standing outside of an office. He was almost a bit like, you know, he was kind of into the road.
65000	71000	That's why I was looking at him. I looked at him and he had a fox fur collar.
71000	74000	It looked rather camp, shouldn't it?
74000	78000	And I looked at him and for a moment I thought he was a clown or something.
78000	86000	Because his face and his hair were the same colour and pattern as this fox fur collar.
88000	96000	And my eyes just zeroed in on him and I thought, hey, is this a reflection? Is he painting his face? What's going on?
96000	99000	But it couldn't account for the hair, of course.
99000	105000	And I kept my eyes right on him as I went right up to him and then passed.
105000	110000	It stayed the same. It wasn't a shadow. The sun wasn't shining on it. It couldn't have been a reflection.
110000	113000	I hadn't gone bonkers because everything was normal.
113000	114000	Give me the arsehole, Jimmy.
114000	115000	I wasn't stressed out. Nothing.
115000	116000	I didn't give you the arsehole.
116000	120000	I thought it must have been a reflection and I left it at that.
120000	127000	However, the same evening, several miles away, I saw the same thing again.
127000	130000	Hold on, Chris. Just got to go for a Jimmy Riddle.
130000	133000	We'll get back to Chris's encounter with the reptile people later.
133000	136000	Meantime, let's go to our next worthy nominee.
136000	141000	What we're going to see is a giant human skeleton found somewhere in South America.
141000	148000	Little was said about it, according to my ghetto gospel, and it was whisked away to a forgotten storage bin somewhere.
148000	155000	Well, all I can say is that this isn't any part of South America I'm familiar with, judging from the style of dress.
155000	159000	And somewhere in South America is not a very convincing source.
159000	164000	But we do know that giant skeletons have been dug up with extraordinary frequency.
164000	170000	They have their picture taken and then we never see them again because apparently they get whisked away to forgotten storage bins.
170000	174000	But one thing they all have in common is a complete lack of a detailed source.
174000	177000	Where the photos came from and where they were published.
177000	183000	Without a source, even a fake one, the authenticity of the photo can't be checked.
183000	187000	So that should be an obvious sign that the photo may have been photoshopped.
187000	190000	But every now and again a hoaxer slips up.
190000	196000	This fake photo was the perfect hoax and even made it into a newspaper, The Hindu Voice.
196000	202000	Unfortunately the hoaxers were silly enough to break the first rule of hoaxing, never give a source.
202000	205000	And they claimed the photo was published in National Geographic.
205000	208000	Now that's very easy to check.
208000	210000	It turns out it wasn't.
210000	216000	And the editors at National Geographic were so fed up with being asked about this that they tracked down the real source of the photo,
216000	221000	a Photoshop competition held by a website called Worth1000.
221000	226000	If you're not convinced, here's the website showing the same photo winning third place in the competition.
226000	229000	And if you're still not convinced, here's the photo again.
229000	232000	And here's the original which was doctored.
232000	235000	It's an excavation of a mastodon in New York State.
235000	238000	These photos also look pretty convincing.
238000	244000	But an astute sceptic who runs this website noticed that both skulls had the same tooth missing
244000	247000	and appeared to be the same skull.
247000	251000	So I decided to check by superimposing one skull over the other.
251000	254000	And sure enough, they are identical.
254000	257000	So here are two hoaxers for the price of one.
257000	260000	Both of these dead giants have been Photoshopped.
260000	265000	So sorry, but these photos don't prove that giants rule the earth as the Bible says.
265000	268000	They show that gullible idiots rule the internet.
268000	272000	And if your belief in the Bible is based on a few obviously Photoshopped pictures,
272000	276000	then it's about as shallow as this phony grave.
276000	282000	The only other evidence the video shows us is this femur from a dead giant and this fossilised giant.
282000	288000	But unfortunately, My Ghetto Gospel once again makes the mistake of showing a source.
288000	292000	And when the picture is tracked down at the Mount Blanco Fossil Museum,
292000	295000	it turns out not to be the femur of a giant.
295000	302000	It says so in the caption, this is just a model of a femur of a giant made by the director of the museum.
302000	308000	Which is about as much proof of real giants as this plastic gnome is proof of real gnomes.
308000	315000	As for the fossilised giant, it turns out this photograph comes from Strand Magazine in 1895.
315000	320000	According to the magazine, the supposed fossil was part of a travelling freak show,
320000	322000	and Sixpence was charged to see it.
322000	326000	Frankly, it's easier to believe Chris's story about people turning into reptiles.
326000	328000	Talking of whichâ€¦
353000	355000	Do what?
365000	369000	Sorry Chris, we're going to have to take a break again from your long story.
369000	374000	Now I always love videos that tell you they're going to disprove one of the most solid theories in science
374000	378000	backed by a mountain of evidence in less than five or ten minutes.
378000	383000	This guy's even more ambitious, claiming to be able to debunk all this evidence in less than three minutes.
383000	386000	You just know that what follows will be crap.
409000	417000	Oh sorry, I misjudged you. This is actually a very clear explanation as to how genetic traits are passed on.
417000	420000	This guy doesn't deserve to be a Golden Crocodile nominee.
423000	425000	Oh crap.
425000	430000	Look, heredity is even better understood than evolution. Even creationists accept it.
438000	445000	This is because genes are passed on. Offspring resemble their parents. If they didn't, you wouldn't look the way you do.
445000	448000	I mean, it's obvious you had no choice in the matter.
448000	454000	So when you say, this can't possibly happen, I don't care how fancy or complicated your explanation is,
454000	459000	the fact is that it does happen. But let's hear the fancy and complicated explanation anyway.
459000	465000	So as you can see in the middle, we have millions and millions of collagen proteins outside of the cell.
465000	469000	And they are no longer under the control of the genes that are in DNA.
469000	479000	So the big question, how do these millions and millions of proteins know to arrange themselves in the perfect order of the human hand, as you can see on the right?
479000	486000	Well of course, chemicals never know anything. They simply follow chemical laws. And collagen proteins follow these laws too.
486000	493000	All I can suggest, Said, is that if you want to know how something works in biology, look at the research and find out.
493000	497000	And if your question hasn't been answered yet, wait until it is.
497000	501000	I've found a number of research papers on how collagen fibrils are formed.
501000	505000	These are the long chain bundles that make up the basic structure of the hand.
505000	513000	If you think this biochemistry is impossible, and that somehow the collagens have to be moved into place by an intelligent designer,
513000	519000	then all I can say is that either the intelligent designer is very sloppy, or he's disturbingly malicious.
519000	527000	I'm not going to give a lecture on this because it's not my field, but one thing I can explain is that genetic traits do indeed get passed on.
527000	537000	Insects that bore through the wooden stories of houses, for example, pass on their physiology and their behaviour to future generations of insects that bore through wooden stories.
537000	539000	And talking of boring stories...
539000	553000	Obviously this is a bit tricky to talk about.
553000	555000	I don't know what you're doing, Mum. Go get it.
555000	559000	These people are sub-human to God. It's called a circle.
559000	567000	A circle is not necessarily just the same. It can be a lizard type creature. Is there any lizard type creature that can do this?
568000	570000	Yes there is, and here he is.
571000	575000	Now, bringing all of this down to earth...
586000	594000	Oh dear. As usual, Friday night at the Dog and Duck has descended into an anarchic punch-up thanks to the arrival of the Chelsea Shed Boys.
594000	599000	Sorry Chris, I'm afraid the explanation of these reptile people will have to wait for another night.
599000	609000	But voters for the coveted Golden Crocoduck can make up their minds now. Do you Adam and Eve it, or is Chris telling porky pies? We report you decide.
609000	615000	Well, I met with my job. I worked for UNICEF, which is an amazing organisation that works in over 150 countries.
615000	624000	And my job was to meet with teenagers who were living in exclusion, who were living in extreme poverty and living with HIV and write their stories.
624000	628000	Listen to their stories and write for UNICEF. And so, I'm here.
628000	637000	Reptilicus, a monstrous massive beast whose astounding appearance causes panic.
640000	645000	Reptilicus approaching the city! Repeat, Reptilicus approaching the city!
