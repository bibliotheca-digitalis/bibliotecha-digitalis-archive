00:00.000 --> 00:07.000
I never thought I would have to actually make a video where I would have to explain that I saw two reptilians.

00:07.000 --> 00:09.000
That I did not account for.

00:09.000 --> 00:16.000
Now I've got to hand it to Chris Constantine. That has to be one of the best opening lines of any video I've ever seen.

00:16.000 --> 00:19.000
It just makes you want to learn more, doesn't it?

00:19.000 --> 00:28.000
So we've got this count of the humans living amongst us who are the Tares, which are basically mini me, Nephilim, and none of us can tell the difference.

00:28.000 --> 00:38.000
Hold on, Chris. I just have to say to anybody out there that if you haven't heard the old I saw someone turn into a reptile kind of story, then you've never spent a Friday evening in a London pub.

00:38.000 --> 00:44.000
So let's listen to Chris's story in a more fitting environment down the local boozer.

00:47.000 --> 00:51.000
There you go, Chris. Quite a bit of it and a pack of crisps.

00:51.000 --> 00:56.000
Now what did I see? Well, I was just coming round the corner in a car...

00:57.000 --> 01:05.000
I saw a guy standing outside of an office. He was almost a bit like, you know, he was kind of into the road.

01:05.000 --> 01:11.000
That's why I was looking at him. I looked at him and he had a fox fur collar.

01:11.000 --> 01:14.000
It looked rather camp, shouldn't it?

01:14.000 --> 01:18.000
And I looked at him and for a moment I thought he was a clown or something.

01:18.000 --> 01:26.000
Because his face and his hair were the same colour and pattern as this fox fur collar.

01:28.000 --> 01:36.000
And my eyes just zeroed in on him and I thought, hey, is this a reflection? Is he painting his face? What's going on?

01:36.000 --> 01:39.000
But it couldn't account for the hair, of course.

01:39.000 --> 01:45.000
And I kept my eyes right on him as I went right up to him and then passed.

01:45.000 --> 01:50.000
It stayed the same. It wasn't a shadow. The sun wasn't shining on it. It couldn't have been a reflection.

01:50.000 --> 01:53.000
I hadn't gone bonkers because everything was normal.

01:53.000 --> 01:54.000
Give me the arsehole, Jimmy.

01:54.000 --> 01:55.000
I wasn't stressed out. Nothing.

01:55.000 --> 01:56.000
I didn't give you the arsehole.

01:56.000 --> 02:00.000
I thought it must have been a reflection and I left it at that.

02:00.000 --> 02:07.000
However, the same evening, several miles away, I saw the same thing again.

02:07.000 --> 02:10.000
Hold on, Chris. Just got to go for a Jimmy Riddle.

02:10.000 --> 02:13.000
We'll get back to Chris's encounter with the reptile people later.

02:13.000 --> 02:16.000
Meantime, let's go to our next worthy nominee.

02:16.000 --> 02:21.000
What we're going to see is a giant human skeleton found somewhere in South America.

02:21.000 --> 02:28.000
Little was said about it, according to my ghetto gospel, and it was whisked away to a forgotten storage bin somewhere.

02:28.000 --> 02:35.000
Well, all I can say is that this isn't any part of South America I'm familiar with, judging from the style of dress.

02:35.000 --> 02:39.000
And somewhere in South America is not a very convincing source.

02:39.000 --> 02:44.000
But we do know that giant skeletons have been dug up with extraordinary frequency.

02:44.000 --> 02:50.000
They have their picture taken and then we never see them again because apparently they get whisked away to forgotten storage bins.

02:50.000 --> 02:54.000
But one thing they all have in common is a complete lack of a detailed source.

02:54.000 --> 02:57.000
Where the photos came from and where they were published.

02:57.000 --> 03:03.000
Without a source, even a fake one, the authenticity of the photo can't be checked.

03:03.000 --> 03:07.000
So that should be an obvious sign that the photo may have been photoshopped.

03:07.000 --> 03:10.000
But every now and again a hoaxer slips up.

03:10.000 --> 03:16.000
This fake photo was the perfect hoax and even made it into a newspaper, The Hindu Voice.

03:16.000 --> 03:22.000
Unfortunately the hoaxers were silly enough to break the first rule of hoaxing, never give a source.

03:22.000 --> 03:25.000
And they claimed the photo was published in National Geographic.

03:25.000 --> 03:28.000
Now that's very easy to check.

03:28.000 --> 03:30.000
It turns out it wasn't.

03:30.000 --> 03:36.000
And the editors at National Geographic were so fed up with being asked about this that they tracked down the real source of the photo,

03:36.000 --> 03:41.000
a Photoshop competition held by a website called Worth1000.

03:41.000 --> 03:46.000
If you're not convinced, here's the website showing the same photo winning third place in the competition.

03:46.000 --> 03:49.000
And if you're still not convinced, here's the photo again.

03:49.000 --> 03:52.000
And here's the original which was doctored.

03:52.000 --> 03:55.000
It's an excavation of a mastodon in New York State.

03:55.000 --> 03:58.000
These photos also look pretty convincing.

03:58.000 --> 04:04.000
But an astute sceptic who runs this website noticed that both skulls had the same tooth missing

04:04.000 --> 04:07.000
and appeared to be the same skull.

04:07.000 --> 04:11.000
So I decided to check by superimposing one skull over the other.

04:11.000 --> 04:14.000
And sure enough, they are identical.

04:14.000 --> 04:17.000
So here are two hoaxers for the price of one.

04:17.000 --> 04:20.000
Both of these dead giants have been Photoshopped.

04:20.000 --> 04:25.000
So sorry, but these photos don't prove that giants rule the earth as the Bible says.

04:25.000 --> 04:28.000
They show that gullible idiots rule the internet.

04:28.000 --> 04:32.000
And if your belief in the Bible is based on a few obviously Photoshopped pictures,

04:32.000 --> 04:36.000
then it's about as shallow as this phony grave.

04:36.000 --> 04:42.000
The only other evidence the video shows us is this femur from a dead giant and this fossilised giant.

04:42.000 --> 04:48.000
But unfortunately, My Ghetto Gospel once again makes the mistake of showing a source.

04:48.000 --> 04:52.000
And when the picture is tracked down at the Mount Blanco Fossil Museum,

04:52.000 --> 04:55.000
it turns out not to be the femur of a giant.

04:55.000 --> 05:02.000
It says so in the caption, this is just a model of a femur of a giant made by the director of the museum.

05:02.000 --> 05:08.000
Which is about as much proof of real giants as this plastic gnome is proof of real gnomes.

05:08.000 --> 05:15.000
As for the fossilised giant, it turns out this photograph comes from Strand Magazine in 1895.

05:15.000 --> 05:20.000
According to the magazine, the supposed fossil was part of a travelling freak show,

05:20.000 --> 05:22.000
and Sixpence was charged to see it.

05:22.000 --> 05:26.000
Frankly, it's easier to believe Chris's story about people turning into reptiles.

05:26.000 --> 05:28.000
Talking of whichâ€¦

05:53.000 --> 05:55.000
Do what?

06:05.000 --> 06:09.000
Sorry Chris, we're going to have to take a break again from your long story.

06:09.000 --> 06:14.000
Now I always love videos that tell you they're going to disprove one of the most solid theories in science

06:14.000 --> 06:18.000
backed by a mountain of evidence in less than five or ten minutes.

06:18.000 --> 06:23.000
This guy's even more ambitious, claiming to be able to debunk all this evidence in less than three minutes.

06:23.000 --> 06:26.000
You just know that what follows will be crap.

06:49.000 --> 06:57.000
Oh sorry, I misjudged you. This is actually a very clear explanation as to how genetic traits are passed on.

06:57.000 --> 07:00.000
This guy doesn't deserve to be a Golden Crocodile nominee.

07:03.000 --> 07:05.000
Oh crap.

07:05.000 --> 07:10.000
Look, heredity is even better understood than evolution. Even creationists accept it.

07:18.000 --> 07:25.000
This is because genes are passed on. Offspring resemble their parents. If they didn't, you wouldn't look the way you do.

07:25.000 --> 07:28.000
I mean, it's obvious you had no choice in the matter.

07:28.000 --> 07:34.000
So when you say, this can't possibly happen, I don't care how fancy or complicated your explanation is,

07:34.000 --> 07:39.000
the fact is that it does happen. But let's hear the fancy and complicated explanation anyway.

07:39.000 --> 07:45.000
So as you can see in the middle, we have millions and millions of collagen proteins outside of the cell.

07:45.000 --> 07:49.000
And they are no longer under the control of the genes that are in DNA.

07:49.000 --> 07:59.000
So the big question, how do these millions and millions of proteins know to arrange themselves in the perfect order of the human hand, as you can see on the right?

07:59.000 --> 08:06.000
Well of course, chemicals never know anything. They simply follow chemical laws. And collagen proteins follow these laws too.

08:06.000 --> 08:13.000
All I can suggest, Said, is that if you want to know how something works in biology, look at the research and find out.

08:13.000 --> 08:17.000
And if your question hasn't been answered yet, wait until it is.

08:17.000 --> 08:21.000
I've found a number of research papers on how collagen fibrils are formed.

08:21.000 --> 08:25.000
These are the long chain bundles that make up the basic structure of the hand.

08:25.000 --> 08:33.000
If you think this biochemistry is impossible, and that somehow the collagens have to be moved into place by an intelligent designer,

08:33.000 --> 08:39.000
then all I can say is that either the intelligent designer is very sloppy, or he's disturbingly malicious.

08:39.000 --> 08:47.000
I'm not going to give a lecture on this because it's not my field, but one thing I can explain is that genetic traits do indeed get passed on.

08:47.000 --> 08:57.000
Insects that bore through the wooden stories of houses, for example, pass on their physiology and their behaviour to future generations of insects that bore through wooden stories.

08:57.000 --> 08:59.000
And talking of boring stories...

08:59.000 --> 09:13.000
Obviously this is a bit tricky to talk about.

09:13.000 --> 09:15.000
I don't know what you're doing, Mum. Go get it.

09:15.000 --> 09:19.000
These people are sub-human to God. It's called a circle.

09:19.000 --> 09:27.000
A circle is not necessarily just the same. It can be a lizard type creature. Is there any lizard type creature that can do this?

09:28.000 --> 09:30.000
Yes there is, and here he is.

09:31.000 --> 09:35.000
Now, bringing all of this down to earth...

09:46.000 --> 09:54.000
Oh dear. As usual, Friday night at the Dog and Duck has descended into an anarchic punch-up thanks to the arrival of the Chelsea Shed Boys.

09:54.000 --> 09:59.000
Sorry Chris, I'm afraid the explanation of these reptile people will have to wait for another night.

09:59.000 --> 10:09.000
But voters for the coveted Golden Crocoduck can make up their minds now. Do you Adam and Eve it, or is Chris telling porky pies? We report you decide.

10:09.000 --> 10:15.000
Well, I met with my job. I worked for UNICEF, which is an amazing organisation that works in over 150 countries.

10:15.000 --> 10:24.000
And my job was to meet with teenagers who were living in exclusion, who were living in extreme poverty and living with HIV and write their stories.

10:24.000 --> 10:28.000
Listen to their stories and write for UNICEF. And so, I'm here.

10:28.000 --> 10:37.000
Reptilicus, a monstrous massive beast whose astounding appearance causes panic.

10:40.000 --> 10:45.000
Reptilicus approaching the city! Repeat, Reptilicus approaching the city!
