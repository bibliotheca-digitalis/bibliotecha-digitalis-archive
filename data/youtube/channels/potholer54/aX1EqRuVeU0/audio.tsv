0	5360	A lot of people have been telling me that my video on some of the lab origin myths about
5360	12200	SARS-CoV-2 was wrong and out of date and there were lots of milk comparisons.
12200	16960	As always, I'm happy to issue corrections if an error is brought to my attention.
16960	19820	So I made the same request to each of them.
19820	27140	If you think there are errors in the video, please quote what I said and explain why you
27140	28860	think it's wrong.
28860	33660	Only one person did find an error, which of course I immediately added to the corrections
33660	36180	section of the video description.
36180	42340	But all the other supposed errors were either just opinions and expressions of disapproval,
42340	47780	a belief that the published science is wrong, a few predictable insults, one person didn't
47780	51700	like the title, or I got no response at all.
51700	55900	The funniest response I got is one which I think I'll have framed.
56100	61600	Just because this clip didn't have any errors doesn't mean it's not fake news.
61600	66000	To those who haven't seen the video, I looked at various claims that were going viral at
66000	72520	the time, like the mysterious intern who supposedly had been infected in a Wuhan lab.
72520	75440	That one went all the way up to a White House press briefing.
75440	80480	An intern was infected who later infected her boyfriend and then went to the wet market
80480	83280	in Wuhan where it began to spread.
83280	87980	When I fact checked that, it turned out to be based on a YouTube video claiming to have
87980	90980	found the source of the coronavirus.
90980	95860	There was no evidence presented except that the intern had no photo on one of the lab's
95860	98260	website pages.
98260	104340	That video, which got over two million hits, was also the source of other widespread myths.
104340	109120	I showed how it had mixed up two different research institutes and was at the end of
109120	115140	a trail of misquotes and deliberate misrepresentations that started with a Chinese professor, Xiao
115140	116980	Butao.
116980	121260	My video also looked at spurious claims that the virus could have leaked because it was
121260	125340	being held in a freezer with an alleged broken seal.
125340	131380	I showed that a supposed secret leaked dossier was in fact just a compilation of information
131380	134700	that was freely available on the internet.
134700	139680	And I showed how researchers had discovered that SARS-CoV-2 has a unique and counterintuitive
139680	145840	backbone, which is consistent with a natural origin, not bioengineering.
145840	150680	But people seem to have mixed up the issue of a man-made virus with the possibility of
150680	154240	a natural virus escaping from the lab.
154240	158400	These are two different things, and here's what I said about the latter.
158400	162880	After all, it's possible someone might have come into contact with bat samples and not
162880	164520	noticed.
164520	168760	According to the Washington Post, officials from the US Embassy in Beijing visited the
168760	174140	Wuhan Institute of Virology a few years ago and were concerned about safety standards
174140	175620	there.
175620	180380	According to the Post, the Chinese researchers at WIV were receiving assistance from the
180380	185300	Galveston National Laboratory, but the Chinese requested additional help.
185300	190140	The cables argued that the United States should give the Wuhan lab further support, mainly
190140	195400	because its research on bat coronaviruses was important but also dangerous.
195400	198460	I haven't seen anything that changes any of that.
198460	203740	The myths are still busted, the paper I cited has gone on to be cited by over 3,000 other
203740	208880	research papers, and the possibility of a lab leak remains.
208880	213200	So what has happened that's caused this sudden flurry of interest?
213200	218520	Well, firstly, a report published in the Wall Street Journal cited anonymous sources in
218520	224500	the US State Department based on the assessment of an unidentified international partner that
224500	231180	three people had got sick at a lab in Wuhan in November 2019 and gone to hospital.
231180	236220	Some media outlets, including the Daily Mail of course, claimed for a fact that this was
236220	237940	Covid-19.
237940	243780	But the fact is we don't know, as the Wall Street Journal makes clear further down the
243780	244780	story.
245320	250120	Look, I know in this day and age we're all supposed to pick a side and have a definitive
250120	251440	opinion.
251440	256640	But I'm not saying the story isn't true, I'm not saying they didn't have Covid, I'm just
256640	262680	saying I have no idea, so like so much of this new information, I find it pointless
262680	267940	to speculate, let alone reach a conclusion based on that speculation.
267940	272240	The other thing that happened was that the US President has asked the intelligence services
272240	277580	to redouble their efforts into finding the origin of the virus after previous investigations
277580	279140	were inconclusive.
279140	286740	Again, all this shows is that a lab leak is possible, it tells us no more than that.
286740	287740	What else happened?
287740	293460	Well, there's been a WHO report into the origin of the virus, but that was compromised by
293460	299720	delays in allowing investigators into China and alleged obstruction by the Chinese authorities
299720	303780	in granting full access and complete transparency.
303780	305680	Does that mean there's a cover-up?
305680	308700	Is this typical Chinese government secrecy?
308700	311860	Or is it resentment of what they see as a foreign interference?
311860	314800	Again, I have no idea.
314800	321380	It doesn't mean a lab leak happened, or that it didn't happen, only that it's possible.
321380	327420	So let's get on to the science and the other hypothesis that the virus is man-made.
327420	331660	The problem, as I explained in my video, is that researchers have found that the virus
331660	335140	shows all the hallmarks of being natural.
335140	340240	Not just the spike protein, which is often manipulated in gain-of-function experiments
340240	345400	because it's the infectious part of the virus, but also the delivery system known as the
345400	347200	backbone.
347200	349840	So has there been anything new on that front?
349840	355440	Well, yes, there was a hypothesis put forward by Segreto and Dagen that the virus could
355460	360780	be man-made, because the furring cleavage site in the SARS-CoV-2 virus could not have
360780	363060	evolved naturally.
363060	367500	As for the backbone problem, they argue that the Wuhan lab researchers could have used
367500	374980	the backbone of an existing virus, RATG13, because that's genetically very close to SARS-CoV-2,
374980	378220	and deliberately evolved it in the lab.
378220	383840	The hypothesis has been laid out in two papers, but both lines of argument have been contradicted
383840	385900	by other research.
385900	392140	This paper shows that a similar furring cleavage site does occur in a natural virus, and another
392140	395520	paper shows the method by which this can happen.
395520	399920	On the second argument, a response paper to Segreto and Dagen pointed out that there's
399920	406540	about a 4% genetic difference between RATG13 and SARS-CoV-2.
406540	413260	That may not sound like much, but there's only a 1% difference between humans and chimpanzees.
413280	420200	Virologists have concluded that SARS-CoV-2 and RATG13 last had a common ancestor in about
420200	422200	1948.
422200	427480	The two viruses are so far apart genetically that changing one into the other would cost
427480	432360	a huge amount of money, time and effort if it could be done at all.
432360	437280	It would also have been completely unnecessary, since backbones are readily available off
437280	438280	the shelf.
438820	443700	I'll be looking at that in more detail in my next video on popular claims by the journalist
443700	445660	Nicholas Wade.
445660	451840	For those reasons, the Segreto and Dagen hypothesis hasn't been widely adopted or cited, in
451840	457900	contrast to the Nature Medicine Study that's been cited over 3,000 times and is consistent
457900	459940	with other research.
459940	465840	The other new development was an explosive new study by Sorensen et al, a journal article
465840	470100	set to make waves among the scientific community.
470100	473740	I was first alluded to it by a post on my forum.
473740	477380	More evidence mounts as we debunk the debunker.
477380	480020	The debunker's supposed to be me, by the way.
480020	486540	According to the poster, this explosive new study shows that the virus is man-made.
486540	492300	But it's never a good sign when the source of your information isn't the journal itself.
492300	494260	It's the Daily Mail.
494260	498760	The Daily Mail says the study was about to be published in the Quarterly Review of Biophysics
498760	505160	Discovery, QRB Discovery, which is a perfectly respectable peer-reviewed journal.
505160	512400	And for some reason, the Daily Mail posted an embargoed copy of the paper on its website.
512400	517080	Straight away that struck me as fishy, as I mentioned to someone else who asked me about
517080	518680	this paper.
518680	523560	Because I often get embargoed papers sent to me, it's very common in the media, and
523560	528140	the whole point of an embargo is that it gives a journalist time to read the paper
528140	530340	and write up the story.
530340	535620	But a news organisation isn't supposed to post the story until after the paper has been
535620	537420	published.
537420	542220	Here the Mail is not only posting a story prior to publication, it's posting a copy
542220	544340	of the paper itself.
544340	549540	I've never seen this happen, so it's quite bizarre.
549540	553380	That aside, what's the evidence shown in the alleged paper?
553400	558280	According to the Daily Mail, the authors found a fingerprint that shows the SARS-CoV-2 virus
558280	564280	couldn't be natural, because it has four positively charged amino acids in a row.
564280	569560	It's rare to find even three in a row in naturally occurring organisms, while four
569560	573700	in a row is extremely unlikely, the scientists said.
573700	579520	The laws of physics mean that you cannot have four positively charged amino acids in a row.
579520	587100	The only way you can get this is if you artificially manufacture it, Dalglish told Dailymail.com.
587100	590020	But this was very easy to check.
590020	594140	One of the posters on my forum said it didn't take him long to find several instances of
594140	600060	four positively charged amino acids in a row in naturally occurring viruses.
600060	603460	I checked his sources, and I found them too.
603460	608980	In two papers I did a simple search for four positively charged amino acids and came up
608980	611040	with several results.
611040	614440	So much for this supposed law of physics.
614440	619800	So why would a reputable peer-reviewed journal like the QRB Discovery be willing to publish
619800	621440	such obvious twaddle?
621440	622440	Answer?
622440	624660	You're ahead of me.
624660	626240	Of course it wasn't.
626240	630540	The Daily Mail's claim that this study was about to be published in that journal, or
630540	633200	any journal, was nonsense.
633200	637500	They simply took the author's word for it, without bothering to check with the journal's
637500	638500	editor.
639220	644280	Once it became clear a few weeks later that this imminent publication wasn't happening,
644280	648360	the Daily Mail removed the name of the journal from the story.
648360	650660	But the damage had already been done.
650660	656460	Hundreds of news sites, blogs and fora had reprinted the Daily Mail claim that this was
656460	662620	a legitimate study about to be published in the QRB Discovery, again without bothering
662620	664700	to check.
664880	668720	Neither did they check the spurious evidence that you can't get four positively charged
668720	673940	amino acids in a row, which is still up there on the Mail website.
673940	679180	You have to go a long way down the Daily Mail story, past the photos and the clickbait to
679180	686420	discover that virologists dismiss this unpublished claim as magical and explain that this amino
686420	690040	acid conjunction is often found in nature.
690080	695160	Unfortunately, that glimpse of reality is in a box relaying how Sorensen et al have
695160	701160	been thwarted in previous publication efforts, not because their essay is bunk, but by a
701160	704760	conspiracy of scientists to silence them.
704760	709720	Next, there was a claim that the lab leak theory had gained credibility because of a
709720	712360	study by Piplani et al.
712360	717560	I think what they mean is that the man-made virus theory had gained credibility since
717560	723320	the study wasn't about a lab leak, it was about how well adapted SARS-CoV-2 is to human
723320	724920	cells.
724920	730820	The authors found that SARS-CoV-2 binds very tightly to human ACE2, the entry point for
730820	734320	coronaviruses into the human body.
734320	739640	Their conclusion is that if the virus is well adapted to human ACE2 it couldn't have jumped
739640	744340	directly from bats to humans, so the authors looked at various candidates that might have
744340	749300	acted as intermediate species, and although some looked promising, they couldn't find
749300	751160	a perfect match.
751160	755340	Which means we're back to where we started, the intermediate species still hasn't been
755340	761540	found, we don't know where the virus came from, and that vacuum of knowledge is what's
761540	764700	been quickly filled with speculation.
764700	770500	So why is it very unlikely that this affinity for human ACE2 is the result of deliberate
770500	773300	manipulation in a lab?
773300	777300	And apart from the reasons already covered, researchers have found that the virus seems
777300	783680	to have evolved in the presence of a human immune system, in other words, naturally.
783680	789140	And the way it binds to ACE2, like so many other things in the SARS-CoV-2 virus, is a
789140	794860	bit messy and counter-intuitive, an intelligent designer wouldn't have designed it that way,
794860	797460	but evolution frequently does.
797460	802200	Finally, another thing that's new is that we've had the email from a senior researcher
802200	807120	at the Scripps Institute saying that one really small part of the genome looks potentially
807120	812760	engineered, but a team of researchers is going to look at it critically, and further analysis
812760	817640	needs to be done, and they should know more by the end of the weekend.
817640	821280	And it turned out that when they did look at it more critically, they discovered that
821280	824760	the virus bore all the hallmarks of being natural.
824760	829320	At least that's what the team, researchers from five different universities and scientific
829320	834560	institutes from three different countries, concluded in Nature Medicine.
834560	839740	So does this mean that the researcher's initial impression had to be correct, and that any
839740	844160	change must therefore be the result of corruption and dishonesty?
844160	849900	Or does it mean that initial impressions in science are often overturned as research continues
849900	852720	and more evidence is found?
852720	857320	I can't claim to know the answer to that one either, so feel free to speculate on your
857320	858600	own.
858600	863640	All I can tell you is that I've been reporting on scientific research for over three decades,
863640	867360	and I don't find such changes at all surprising.
867360	872100	In fact, I've reported this on my channel before, when a rather crude estimate of past
872100	876920	temperatures was improved as better data became available.
876920	882340	That update led to howls of protest because the latest information didn't fit what a lot
882340	885280	of people wanted to believe.
885280	889200	The bottom line is that there are a lot of questions that we still don't have answers
889200	894460	to, and I wish I could make something up for you, like so many others are doing.
894460	898560	In fact, a lot of the theories that are coming out of this speculation are simply throwing
898560	901480	up more questions that don't have answers.
901480	906020	All I can do is check some of the claims that are bouncing around the internet and weed
906020	908160	out the ones that are bullcrap.
908160	910580	I hope that helps.
910580	915060	Asking lots of questions and then speculating and offering opinion is fine.
915060	919860	If you enjoy that kind of thing, but I'd rather not join the pack.
919860	923000	Of course, we do need to know where the virus came from.
923000	929060	But a definitive answer will only come from solid evidence, not misquotes, changed documents,
929060	935400	fake dossiers, exaggerations, fabrications, misrepresentations and magical facts dreamed
935400	938380	up in published papers that don't exist.
938380	944180	It won't come from circumstantial evidence, suspicions, guesswork or possibilities either,
944180	950400	unless and until the questions thrown up by this speculation are themselves answered.
950400	954960	But of course, that's not going to stop people pointlessly speculating.
954960	960000	These pundits always love to put quotes alongside their speculation to give it some kind of
960000	962420	intellectual legitimacy.
962420	967820	So I'm going to leave you with the wise words of that much overlooked philosopher and 20th
967820	971900	century intellectual giant, Ryan O'Neill, who said this.
971900	975620	Anything is possible, but possible don't make it true.
1001900	1002900	Thank you.
1002900	1002900
