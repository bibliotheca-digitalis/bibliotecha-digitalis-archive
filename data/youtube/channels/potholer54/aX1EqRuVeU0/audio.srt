1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,360
A lot of people have been telling me that my video on some of the lab origin myths about

2
00:00:05,360 --> 00:00:12,200
SARS-CoV-2 was wrong and out of date and there were lots of milk comparisons.

3
00:00:12,200 --> 00:00:16,960
As always, I'm happy to issue corrections if an error is brought to my attention.

4
00:00:16,960 --> 00:00:19,820
So I made the same request to each of them.

5
00:00:19,820 --> 00:00:27,140
If you think there are errors in the video, please quote what I said and explain why you

6
00:00:27,140 --> 00:00:28,860
think it's wrong.

7
00:00:28,860 --> 00:00:33,660
Only one person did find an error, which of course I immediately added to the corrections

8
00:00:33,660 --> 00:00:36,180
section of the video description.

9
00:00:36,180 --> 00:00:42,340
But all the other supposed errors were either just opinions and expressions of disapproval,

10
00:00:42,340 --> 00:00:47,780
a belief that the published science is wrong, a few predictable insults, one person didn't

11
00:00:47,780 --> 00:00:51,700
like the title, or I got no response at all.

12
00:00:51,700 --> 00:00:55,900
The funniest response I got is one which I think I'll have framed.

13
00:00:56,100 --> 00:01:01,600
Just because this clip didn't have any errors doesn't mean it's not fake news.

14
00:01:01,600 --> 00:01:06,000
To those who haven't seen the video, I looked at various claims that were going viral at

15
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:12,520
the time, like the mysterious intern who supposedly had been infected in a Wuhan lab.

16
00:01:12,520 --> 00:01:15,440
That one went all the way up to a White House press briefing.

17
00:01:15,440 --> 00:01:20,480
An intern was infected who later infected her boyfriend and then went to the wet market

18
00:01:20,480 --> 00:01:23,280
in Wuhan where it began to spread.

19
00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:27,980
When I fact checked that, it turned out to be based on a YouTube video claiming to have

20
00:01:27,980 --> 00:01:30,980
found the source of the coronavirus.

21
00:01:30,980 --> 00:01:35,860
There was no evidence presented except that the intern had no photo on one of the lab's

22
00:01:35,860 --> 00:01:38,260
website pages.

23
00:01:38,260 --> 00:01:44,340
That video, which got over two million hits, was also the source of other widespread myths.

24
00:01:44,340 --> 00:01:49,120
I showed how it had mixed up two different research institutes and was at the end of

25
00:01:49,120 --> 00:01:55,140
a trail of misquotes and deliberate misrepresentations that started with a Chinese professor, Xiao

26
00:01:55,140 --> 00:01:56,980
Butao.

27
00:01:56,980 --> 00:02:01,260
My video also looked at spurious claims that the virus could have leaked because it was

28
00:02:01,260 --> 00:02:05,340
being held in a freezer with an alleged broken seal.

29
00:02:05,340 --> 00:02:11,380
I showed that a supposed secret leaked dossier was in fact just a compilation of information

30
00:02:11,380 --> 00:02:14,700
that was freely available on the internet.

31
00:02:14,700 --> 00:02:19,680
And I showed how researchers had discovered that SARS-CoV-2 has a unique and counterintuitive

32
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:25,840
backbone, which is consistent with a natural origin, not bioengineering.

33
00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:30,680
But people seem to have mixed up the issue of a man-made virus with the possibility of

34
00:02:30,680 --> 00:02:34,240
a natural virus escaping from the lab.

35
00:02:34,240 --> 00:02:38,400
These are two different things, and here's what I said about the latter.

36
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:42,880
After all, it's possible someone might have come into contact with bat samples and not

37
00:02:42,880 --> 00:02:44,520
noticed.

38
00:02:44,520 --> 00:02:48,760
According to the Washington Post, officials from the US Embassy in Beijing visited the

39
00:02:48,760 --> 00:02:54,140
Wuhan Institute of Virology a few years ago and were concerned about safety standards

40
00:02:54,140 --> 00:02:55,620
there.

41
00:02:55,620 --> 00:03:00,380
According to the Post, the Chinese researchers at WIV were receiving assistance from the

42
00:03:00,380 --> 00:03:05,300
Galveston National Laboratory, but the Chinese requested additional help.

43
00:03:05,300 --> 00:03:10,140
The cables argued that the United States should give the Wuhan lab further support, mainly

44
00:03:10,140 --> 00:03:15,400
because its research on bat coronaviruses was important but also dangerous.

45
00:03:15,400 --> 00:03:18,460
I haven't seen anything that changes any of that.

46
00:03:18,460 --> 00:03:23,740
The myths are still busted, the paper I cited has gone on to be cited by over 3,000 other

47
00:03:23,740 --> 00:03:28,880
research papers, and the possibility of a lab leak remains.

48
00:03:28,880 --> 00:03:33,200
So what has happened that's caused this sudden flurry of interest?

49
00:03:33,200 --> 00:03:38,520
Well, firstly, a report published in the Wall Street Journal cited anonymous sources in

50
00:03:38,520 --> 00:03:44,500
the US State Department based on the assessment of an unidentified international partner that

51
00:03:44,500 --> 00:03:51,180
three people had got sick at a lab in Wuhan in November 2019 and gone to hospital.

52
00:03:51,180 --> 00:03:56,220
Some media outlets, including the Daily Mail of course, claimed for a fact that this was

53
00:03:56,220 --> 00:03:57,940
Covid-19.

54
00:03:57,940 --> 00:04:03,780
But the fact is we don't know, as the Wall Street Journal makes clear further down the

55
00:04:03,780 --> 00:04:04,780
story.

56
00:04:05,320 --> 00:04:10,120
Look, I know in this day and age we're all supposed to pick a side and have a definitive

57
00:04:10,120 --> 00:04:11,440
opinion.

58
00:04:11,440 --> 00:04:16,640
But I'm not saying the story isn't true, I'm not saying they didn't have Covid, I'm just

59
00:04:16,640 --> 00:04:22,680
saying I have no idea, so like so much of this new information, I find it pointless

60
00:04:22,680 --> 00:04:27,940
to speculate, let alone reach a conclusion based on that speculation.

61
00:04:27,940 --> 00:04:32,240
The other thing that happened was that the US President has asked the intelligence services

62
00:04:32,240 --> 00:04:37,580
to redouble their efforts into finding the origin of the virus after previous investigations

63
00:04:37,580 --> 00:04:39,140
were inconclusive.

64
00:04:39,140 --> 00:04:46,740
Again, all this shows is that a lab leak is possible, it tells us no more than that.

65
00:04:46,740 --> 00:04:47,740
What else happened?

66
00:04:47,740 --> 00:04:53,460
Well, there's been a WHO report into the origin of the virus, but that was compromised by

67
00:04:53,460 --> 00:04:59,720
delays in allowing investigators into China and alleged obstruction by the Chinese authorities

68
00:04:59,720 --> 00:05:03,780
in granting full access and complete transparency.

69
00:05:03,780 --> 00:05:05,680
Does that mean there's a cover-up?

70
00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:08,700
Is this typical Chinese government secrecy?

71
00:05:08,700 --> 00:05:11,860
Or is it resentment of what they see as a foreign interference?

72
00:05:11,860 --> 00:05:14,800
Again, I have no idea.

73
00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:21,380
It doesn't mean a lab leak happened, or that it didn't happen, only that it's possible.

74
00:05:21,380 --> 00:05:27,420
So let's get on to the science and the other hypothesis that the virus is man-made.

75
00:05:27,420 --> 00:05:31,660
The problem, as I explained in my video, is that researchers have found that the virus

76
00:05:31,660 --> 00:05:35,140
shows all the hallmarks of being natural.

77
00:05:35,140 --> 00:05:40,240
Not just the spike protein, which is often manipulated in gain-of-function experiments

78
00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:45,400
because it's the infectious part of the virus, but also the delivery system known as the

79
00:05:45,400 --> 00:05:47,200
backbone.

80
00:05:47,200 --> 00:05:49,840
So has there been anything new on that front?

81
00:05:49,840 --> 00:05:55,440
Well, yes, there was a hypothesis put forward by Segreto and Dagen that the virus could

82
00:05:55,460 --> 00:06:00,780
be man-made, because the furring cleavage site in the SARS-CoV-2 virus could not have

83
00:06:00,780 --> 00:06:03,060
evolved naturally.

84
00:06:03,060 --> 00:06:07,500
As for the backbone problem, they argue that the Wuhan lab researchers could have used

85
00:06:07,500 --> 00:06:14,980
the backbone of an existing virus, RATG13, because that's genetically very close to SARS-CoV-2,

86
00:06:14,980 --> 00:06:18,220
and deliberately evolved it in the lab.

87
00:06:18,220 --> 00:06:23,840
The hypothesis has been laid out in two papers, but both lines of argument have been contradicted

88
00:06:23,840 --> 00:06:25,900
by other research.

89
00:06:25,900 --> 00:06:32,140
This paper shows that a similar furring cleavage site does occur in a natural virus, and another

90
00:06:32,140 --> 00:06:35,520
paper shows the method by which this can happen.

91
00:06:35,520 --> 00:06:39,920
On the second argument, a response paper to Segreto and Dagen pointed out that there's

92
00:06:39,920 --> 00:06:46,540
about a 4% genetic difference between RATG13 and SARS-CoV-2.

93
00:06:46,540 --> 00:06:53,260
That may not sound like much, but there's only a 1% difference between humans and chimpanzees.

94
00:06:53,280 --> 00:07:00,200
Virologists have concluded that SARS-CoV-2 and RATG13 last had a common ancestor in about

95
00:07:00,200 --> 00:07:02,200
1948.

96
00:07:02,200 --> 00:07:07,480
The two viruses are so far apart genetically that changing one into the other would cost

97
00:07:07,480 --> 00:07:12,360
a huge amount of money, time and effort if it could be done at all.

98
00:07:12,360 --> 00:07:17,280
It would also have been completely unnecessary, since backbones are readily available off

99
00:07:17,280 --> 00:07:18,280
the shelf.

100
00:07:18,820 --> 00:07:23,700
I'll be looking at that in more detail in my next video on popular claims by the journalist

101
00:07:23,700 --> 00:07:25,660
Nicholas Wade.

102
00:07:25,660 --> 00:07:31,840
For those reasons, the Segreto and Dagen hypothesis hasn't been widely adopted or cited, in

103
00:07:31,840 --> 00:07:37,900
contrast to the Nature Medicine Study that's been cited over 3,000 times and is consistent

104
00:07:37,900 --> 00:07:39,940
with other research.

105
00:07:39,940 --> 00:07:45,840
The other new development was an explosive new study by Sorensen et al, a journal article

106
00:07:45,840 --> 00:07:50,100
set to make waves among the scientific community.

107
00:07:50,100 --> 00:07:53,740
I was first alluded to it by a post on my forum.

108
00:07:53,740 --> 00:07:57,380
More evidence mounts as we debunk the debunker.

109
00:07:57,380 --> 00:08:00,020
The debunker's supposed to be me, by the way.

110
00:08:00,020 --> 00:08:06,540
According to the poster, this explosive new study shows that the virus is man-made.

111
00:08:06,540 --> 00:08:12,300
But it's never a good sign when the source of your information isn't the journal itself.

112
00:08:12,300 --> 00:08:14,260
It's the Daily Mail.

113
00:08:14,260 --> 00:08:18,760
The Daily Mail says the study was about to be published in the Quarterly Review of Biophysics

114
00:08:18,760 --> 00:08:25,160
Discovery, QRB Discovery, which is a perfectly respectable peer-reviewed journal.

115
00:08:25,160 --> 00:08:32,400
And for some reason, the Daily Mail posted an embargoed copy of the paper on its website.

116
00:08:32,400 --> 00:08:37,080
Straight away that struck me as fishy, as I mentioned to someone else who asked me about

117
00:08:37,080 --> 00:08:38,680
this paper.

118
00:08:38,680 --> 00:08:43,560
Because I often get embargoed papers sent to me, it's very common in the media, and

119
00:08:43,560 --> 00:08:48,140
the whole point of an embargo is that it gives a journalist time to read the paper

120
00:08:48,140 --> 00:08:50,340
and write up the story.

121
00:08:50,340 --> 00:08:55,620
But a news organisation isn't supposed to post the story until after the paper has been

122
00:08:55,620 --> 00:08:57,420
published.

123
00:08:57,420 --> 00:09:02,220
Here the Mail is not only posting a story prior to publication, it's posting a copy

124
00:09:02,220 --> 00:09:04,340
of the paper itself.

125
00:09:04,340 --> 00:09:09,540
I've never seen this happen, so it's quite bizarre.

126
00:09:09,540 --> 00:09:13,380
That aside, what's the evidence shown in the alleged paper?

127
00:09:13,400 --> 00:09:18,280
According to the Daily Mail, the authors found a fingerprint that shows the SARS-CoV-2 virus

128
00:09:18,280 --> 00:09:24,280
couldn't be natural, because it has four positively charged amino acids in a row.

129
00:09:24,280 --> 00:09:29,560
It's rare to find even three in a row in naturally occurring organisms, while four

130
00:09:29,560 --> 00:09:33,700
in a row is extremely unlikely, the scientists said.

131
00:09:33,700 --> 00:09:39,520
The laws of physics mean that you cannot have four positively charged amino acids in a row.

132
00:09:39,520 --> 00:09:47,100
The only way you can get this is if you artificially manufacture it, Dalglish told Dailymail.com.

133
00:09:47,100 --> 00:09:50,020
But this was very easy to check.

134
00:09:50,020 --> 00:09:54,140
One of the posters on my forum said it didn't take him long to find several instances of

135
00:09:54,140 --> 00:10:00,060
four positively charged amino acids in a row in naturally occurring viruses.

136
00:10:00,060 --> 00:10:03,460
I checked his sources, and I found them too.

137
00:10:03,460 --> 00:10:08,980
In two papers I did a simple search for four positively charged amino acids and came up

138
00:10:08,980 --> 00:10:11,040
with several results.

139
00:10:11,040 --> 00:10:14,440
So much for this supposed law of physics.

140
00:10:14,440 --> 00:10:19,800
So why would a reputable peer-reviewed journal like the QRB Discovery be willing to publish

141
00:10:19,800 --> 00:10:21,440
such obvious twaddle?

142
00:10:21,440 --> 00:10:22,440
Answer?

143
00:10:22,440 --> 00:10:24,660
You're ahead of me.

144
00:10:24,660 --> 00:10:26,240
Of course it wasn't.

145
00:10:26,240 --> 00:10:30,540
The Daily Mail's claim that this study was about to be published in that journal, or

146
00:10:30,540 --> 00:10:33,200
any journal, was nonsense.

147
00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:37,500
They simply took the author's word for it, without bothering to check with the journal's

148
00:10:37,500 --> 00:10:38,500
editor.

149
00:10:39,220 --> 00:10:44,280
Once it became clear a few weeks later that this imminent publication wasn't happening,

150
00:10:44,280 --> 00:10:48,360
the Daily Mail removed the name of the journal from the story.

151
00:10:48,360 --> 00:10:50,660
But the damage had already been done.

152
00:10:50,660 --> 00:10:56,460
Hundreds of news sites, blogs and fora had reprinted the Daily Mail claim that this was

153
00:10:56,460 --> 00:11:02,620
a legitimate study about to be published in the QRB Discovery, again without bothering

154
00:11:02,620 --> 00:11:04,700
to check.

155
00:11:04,880 --> 00:11:08,720
Neither did they check the spurious evidence that you can't get four positively charged

156
00:11:08,720 --> 00:11:13,940
amino acids in a row, which is still up there on the Mail website.

157
00:11:13,940 --> 00:11:19,180
You have to go a long way down the Daily Mail story, past the photos and the clickbait to

158
00:11:19,180 --> 00:11:26,420
discover that virologists dismiss this unpublished claim as magical and explain that this amino

159
00:11:26,420 --> 00:11:30,040
acid conjunction is often found in nature.

160
00:11:30,080 --> 00:11:35,160
Unfortunately, that glimpse of reality is in a box relaying how Sorensen et al have

161
00:11:35,160 --> 00:11:41,160
been thwarted in previous publication efforts, not because their essay is bunk, but by a

162
00:11:41,160 --> 00:11:44,760
conspiracy of scientists to silence them.

163
00:11:44,760 --> 00:11:49,720
Next, there was a claim that the lab leak theory had gained credibility because of a

164
00:11:49,720 --> 00:11:52,360
study by Piplani et al.

165
00:11:52,360 --> 00:11:57,560
I think what they mean is that the man-made virus theory had gained credibility since

166
00:11:57,560 --> 00:12:03,320
the study wasn't about a lab leak, it was about how well adapted SARS-CoV-2 is to human

167
00:12:03,320 --> 00:12:04,920
cells.

168
00:12:04,920 --> 00:12:10,820
The authors found that SARS-CoV-2 binds very tightly to human ACE2, the entry point for

169
00:12:10,820 --> 00:12:14,320
coronaviruses into the human body.

170
00:12:14,320 --> 00:12:19,640
Their conclusion is that if the virus is well adapted to human ACE2 it couldn't have jumped

171
00:12:19,640 --> 00:12:24,340
directly from bats to humans, so the authors looked at various candidates that might have

172
00:12:24,340 --> 00:12:29,300
acted as intermediate species, and although some looked promising, they couldn't find

173
00:12:29,300 --> 00:12:31,160
a perfect match.

174
00:12:31,160 --> 00:12:35,340
Which means we're back to where we started, the intermediate species still hasn't been

175
00:12:35,340 --> 00:12:41,540
found, we don't know where the virus came from, and that vacuum of knowledge is what's

176
00:12:41,540 --> 00:12:44,700
been quickly filled with speculation.

177
00:12:44,700 --> 00:12:50,500
So why is it very unlikely that this affinity for human ACE2 is the result of deliberate

178
00:12:50,500 --> 00:12:53,300
manipulation in a lab?

179
00:12:53,300 --> 00:12:57,300
And apart from the reasons already covered, researchers have found that the virus seems

180
00:12:57,300 --> 00:13:03,680
to have evolved in the presence of a human immune system, in other words, naturally.

181
00:13:03,680 --> 00:13:09,140
And the way it binds to ACE2, like so many other things in the SARS-CoV-2 virus, is a

182
00:13:09,140 --> 00:13:14,860
bit messy and counter-intuitive, an intelligent designer wouldn't have designed it that way,

183
00:13:14,860 --> 00:13:17,460
but evolution frequently does.

184
00:13:17,460 --> 00:13:22,200
Finally, another thing that's new is that we've had the email from a senior researcher

185
00:13:22,200 --> 00:13:27,120
at the Scripps Institute saying that one really small part of the genome looks potentially

186
00:13:27,120 --> 00:13:32,760
engineered, but a team of researchers is going to look at it critically, and further analysis

187
00:13:32,760 --> 00:13:37,640
needs to be done, and they should know more by the end of the weekend.

188
00:13:37,640 --> 00:13:41,280
And it turned out that when they did look at it more critically, they discovered that

189
00:13:41,280 --> 00:13:44,760
the virus bore all the hallmarks of being natural.

190
00:13:44,760 --> 00:13:49,320
At least that's what the team, researchers from five different universities and scientific

191
00:13:49,320 --> 00:13:54,560
institutes from three different countries, concluded in Nature Medicine.

192
00:13:54,560 --> 00:13:59,740
So does this mean that the researcher's initial impression had to be correct, and that any

193
00:13:59,740 --> 00:14:04,160
change must therefore be the result of corruption and dishonesty?

194
00:14:04,160 --> 00:14:09,900
Or does it mean that initial impressions in science are often overturned as research continues

195
00:14:09,900 --> 00:14:12,720
and more evidence is found?

196
00:14:12,720 --> 00:14:17,320
I can't claim to know the answer to that one either, so feel free to speculate on your

197
00:14:17,320 --> 00:14:18,600
own.

198
00:14:18,600 --> 00:14:23,640
All I can tell you is that I've been reporting on scientific research for over three decades,

199
00:14:23,640 --> 00:14:27,360
and I don't find such changes at all surprising.

200
00:14:27,360 --> 00:14:32,100
In fact, I've reported this on my channel before, when a rather crude estimate of past

201
00:14:32,100 --> 00:14:36,920
temperatures was improved as better data became available.

202
00:14:36,920 --> 00:14:42,340
That update led to howls of protest because the latest information didn't fit what a lot

203
00:14:42,340 --> 00:14:45,280
of people wanted to believe.

204
00:14:45,280 --> 00:14:49,200
The bottom line is that there are a lot of questions that we still don't have answers

205
00:14:49,200 --> 00:14:54,460
to, and I wish I could make something up for you, like so many others are doing.

206
00:14:54,460 --> 00:14:58,560
In fact, a lot of the theories that are coming out of this speculation are simply throwing

207
00:14:58,560 --> 00:15:01,480
up more questions that don't have answers.

208
00:15:01,480 --> 00:15:06,020
All I can do is check some of the claims that are bouncing around the internet and weed

209
00:15:06,020 --> 00:15:08,160
out the ones that are bullcrap.

210
00:15:08,160 --> 00:15:10,580
I hope that helps.

211
00:15:10,580 --> 00:15:15,060
Asking lots of questions and then speculating and offering opinion is fine.

212
00:15:15,060 --> 00:15:19,860
If you enjoy that kind of thing, but I'd rather not join the pack.

213
00:15:19,860 --> 00:15:23,000
Of course, we do need to know where the virus came from.

214
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:29,060
But a definitive answer will only come from solid evidence, not misquotes, changed documents,

215
00:15:29,060 --> 00:15:35,400
fake dossiers, exaggerations, fabrications, misrepresentations and magical facts dreamed

216
00:15:35,400 --> 00:15:38,380
up in published papers that don't exist.

217
00:15:38,380 --> 00:15:44,180
It won't come from circumstantial evidence, suspicions, guesswork or possibilities either,

218
00:15:44,180 --> 00:15:50,400
unless and until the questions thrown up by this speculation are themselves answered.

219
00:15:50,400 --> 00:15:54,960
But of course, that's not going to stop people pointlessly speculating.

220
00:15:54,960 --> 00:16:00,000
These pundits always love to put quotes alongside their speculation to give it some kind of

221
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:02,420
intellectual legitimacy.

222
00:16:02,420 --> 00:16:07,820
So I'm going to leave you with the wise words of that much overlooked philosopher and 20th

223
00:16:07,820 --> 00:16:11,900
century intellectual giant, Ryan O'Neill, who said this.

224
00:16:11,900 --> 00:16:15,620
Anything is possible, but possible don't make it true.

225
00:16:41,900 --> 00:16:42,900
Thank you.

226
00:16:42,900 --> 00:16:42,900
