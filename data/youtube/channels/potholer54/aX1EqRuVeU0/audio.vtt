00:00.000 --> 00:05.360
A lot of people have been telling me that my video on some of the lab origin myths about

00:05.360 --> 00:12.200
SARS-CoV-2 was wrong and out of date and there were lots of milk comparisons.

00:12.200 --> 00:16.960
As always, I'm happy to issue corrections if an error is brought to my attention.

00:16.960 --> 00:19.820
So I made the same request to each of them.

00:19.820 --> 00:27.140
If you think there are errors in the video, please quote what I said and explain why you

00:27.140 --> 00:28.860
think it's wrong.

00:28.860 --> 00:33.660
Only one person did find an error, which of course I immediately added to the corrections

00:33.660 --> 00:36.180
section of the video description.

00:36.180 --> 00:42.340
But all the other supposed errors were either just opinions and expressions of disapproval,

00:42.340 --> 00:47.780
a belief that the published science is wrong, a few predictable insults, one person didn't

00:47.780 --> 00:51.700
like the title, or I got no response at all.

00:51.700 --> 00:55.900
The funniest response I got is one which I think I'll have framed.

00:56.100 --> 01:01.600
Just because this clip didn't have any errors doesn't mean it's not fake news.

01:01.600 --> 01:06.000
To those who haven't seen the video, I looked at various claims that were going viral at

01:06.000 --> 01:12.520
the time, like the mysterious intern who supposedly had been infected in a Wuhan lab.

01:12.520 --> 01:15.440
That one went all the way up to a White House press briefing.

01:15.440 --> 01:20.480
An intern was infected who later infected her boyfriend and then went to the wet market

01:20.480 --> 01:23.280
in Wuhan where it began to spread.

01:23.280 --> 01:27.980
When I fact checked that, it turned out to be based on a YouTube video claiming to have

01:27.980 --> 01:30.980
found the source of the coronavirus.

01:30.980 --> 01:35.860
There was no evidence presented except that the intern had no photo on one of the lab's

01:35.860 --> 01:38.260
website pages.

01:38.260 --> 01:44.340
That video, which got over two million hits, was also the source of other widespread myths.

01:44.340 --> 01:49.120
I showed how it had mixed up two different research institutes and was at the end of

01:49.120 --> 01:55.140
a trail of misquotes and deliberate misrepresentations that started with a Chinese professor, Xiao

01:55.140 --> 01:56.980
Butao.

01:56.980 --> 02:01.260
My video also looked at spurious claims that the virus could have leaked because it was

02:01.260 --> 02:05.340
being held in a freezer with an alleged broken seal.

02:05.340 --> 02:11.380
I showed that a supposed secret leaked dossier was in fact just a compilation of information

02:11.380 --> 02:14.700
that was freely available on the internet.

02:14.700 --> 02:19.680
And I showed how researchers had discovered that SARS-CoV-2 has a unique and counterintuitive

02:19.680 --> 02:25.840
backbone, which is consistent with a natural origin, not bioengineering.

02:25.840 --> 02:30.680
But people seem to have mixed up the issue of a man-made virus with the possibility of

02:30.680 --> 02:34.240
a natural virus escaping from the lab.

02:34.240 --> 02:38.400
These are two different things, and here's what I said about the latter.

02:38.400 --> 02:42.880
After all, it's possible someone might have come into contact with bat samples and not

02:42.880 --> 02:44.520
noticed.

02:44.520 --> 02:48.760
According to the Washington Post, officials from the US Embassy in Beijing visited the

02:48.760 --> 02:54.140
Wuhan Institute of Virology a few years ago and were concerned about safety standards

02:54.140 --> 02:55.620
there.

02:55.620 --> 03:00.380
According to the Post, the Chinese researchers at WIV were receiving assistance from the

03:00.380 --> 03:05.300
Galveston National Laboratory, but the Chinese requested additional help.

03:05.300 --> 03:10.140
The cables argued that the United States should give the Wuhan lab further support, mainly

03:10.140 --> 03:15.400
because its research on bat coronaviruses was important but also dangerous.

03:15.400 --> 03:18.460
I haven't seen anything that changes any of that.

03:18.460 --> 03:23.740
The myths are still busted, the paper I cited has gone on to be cited by over 3,000 other

03:23.740 --> 03:28.880
research papers, and the possibility of a lab leak remains.

03:28.880 --> 03:33.200
So what has happened that's caused this sudden flurry of interest?

03:33.200 --> 03:38.520
Well, firstly, a report published in the Wall Street Journal cited anonymous sources in

03:38.520 --> 03:44.500
the US State Department based on the assessment of an unidentified international partner that

03:44.500 --> 03:51.180
three people had got sick at a lab in Wuhan in November 2019 and gone to hospital.

03:51.180 --> 03:56.220
Some media outlets, including the Daily Mail of course, claimed for a fact that this was

03:56.220 --> 03:57.940
Covid-19.

03:57.940 --> 04:03.780
But the fact is we don't know, as the Wall Street Journal makes clear further down the

04:03.780 --> 04:04.780
story.

04:05.320 --> 04:10.120
Look, I know in this day and age we're all supposed to pick a side and have a definitive

04:10.120 --> 04:11.440
opinion.

04:11.440 --> 04:16.640
But I'm not saying the story isn't true, I'm not saying they didn't have Covid, I'm just

04:16.640 --> 04:22.680
saying I have no idea, so like so much of this new information, I find it pointless

04:22.680 --> 04:27.940
to speculate, let alone reach a conclusion based on that speculation.

04:27.940 --> 04:32.240
The other thing that happened was that the US President has asked the intelligence services

04:32.240 --> 04:37.580
to redouble their efforts into finding the origin of the virus after previous investigations

04:37.580 --> 04:39.140
were inconclusive.

04:39.140 --> 04:46.740
Again, all this shows is that a lab leak is possible, it tells us no more than that.

04:46.740 --> 04:47.740
What else happened?

04:47.740 --> 04:53.460
Well, there's been a WHO report into the origin of the virus, but that was compromised by

04:53.460 --> 04:59.720
delays in allowing investigators into China and alleged obstruction by the Chinese authorities

04:59.720 --> 05:03.780
in granting full access and complete transparency.

05:03.780 --> 05:05.680
Does that mean there's a cover-up?

05:05.680 --> 05:08.700
Is this typical Chinese government secrecy?

05:08.700 --> 05:11.860
Or is it resentment of what they see as a foreign interference?

05:11.860 --> 05:14.800
Again, I have no idea.

05:14.800 --> 05:21.380
It doesn't mean a lab leak happened, or that it didn't happen, only that it's possible.

05:21.380 --> 05:27.420
So let's get on to the science and the other hypothesis that the virus is man-made.

05:27.420 --> 05:31.660
The problem, as I explained in my video, is that researchers have found that the virus

05:31.660 --> 05:35.140
shows all the hallmarks of being natural.

05:35.140 --> 05:40.240
Not just the spike protein, which is often manipulated in gain-of-function experiments

05:40.240 --> 05:45.400
because it's the infectious part of the virus, but also the delivery system known as the

05:45.400 --> 05:47.200
backbone.

05:47.200 --> 05:49.840
So has there been anything new on that front?

05:49.840 --> 05:55.440
Well, yes, there was a hypothesis put forward by Segreto and Dagen that the virus could

05:55.460 --> 06:00.780
be man-made, because the furring cleavage site in the SARS-CoV-2 virus could not have

06:00.780 --> 06:03.060
evolved naturally.

06:03.060 --> 06:07.500
As for the backbone problem, they argue that the Wuhan lab researchers could have used

06:07.500 --> 06:14.980
the backbone of an existing virus, RATG13, because that's genetically very close to SARS-CoV-2,

06:14.980 --> 06:18.220
and deliberately evolved it in the lab.

06:18.220 --> 06:23.840
The hypothesis has been laid out in two papers, but both lines of argument have been contradicted

06:23.840 --> 06:25.900
by other research.

06:25.900 --> 06:32.140
This paper shows that a similar furring cleavage site does occur in a natural virus, and another

06:32.140 --> 06:35.520
paper shows the method by which this can happen.

06:35.520 --> 06:39.920
On the second argument, a response paper to Segreto and Dagen pointed out that there's

06:39.920 --> 06:46.540
about a 4% genetic difference between RATG13 and SARS-CoV-2.

06:46.540 --> 06:53.260
That may not sound like much, but there's only a 1% difference between humans and chimpanzees.

06:53.280 --> 07:00.200
Virologists have concluded that SARS-CoV-2 and RATG13 last had a common ancestor in about

07:00.200 --> 07:02.200
1948.

07:02.200 --> 07:07.480
The two viruses are so far apart genetically that changing one into the other would cost

07:07.480 --> 07:12.360
a huge amount of money, time and effort if it could be done at all.

07:12.360 --> 07:17.280
It would also have been completely unnecessary, since backbones are readily available off

07:17.280 --> 07:18.280
the shelf.

07:18.820 --> 07:23.700
I'll be looking at that in more detail in my next video on popular claims by the journalist

07:23.700 --> 07:25.660
Nicholas Wade.

07:25.660 --> 07:31.840
For those reasons, the Segreto and Dagen hypothesis hasn't been widely adopted or cited, in

07:31.840 --> 07:37.900
contrast to the Nature Medicine Study that's been cited over 3,000 times and is consistent

07:37.900 --> 07:39.940
with other research.

07:39.940 --> 07:45.840
The other new development was an explosive new study by Sorensen et al, a journal article

07:45.840 --> 07:50.100
set to make waves among the scientific community.

07:50.100 --> 07:53.740
I was first alluded to it by a post on my forum.

07:53.740 --> 07:57.380
More evidence mounts as we debunk the debunker.

07:57.380 --> 08:00.020
The debunker's supposed to be me, by the way.

08:00.020 --> 08:06.540
According to the poster, this explosive new study shows that the virus is man-made.

08:06.540 --> 08:12.300
But it's never a good sign when the source of your information isn't the journal itself.

08:12.300 --> 08:14.260
It's the Daily Mail.

08:14.260 --> 08:18.760
The Daily Mail says the study was about to be published in the Quarterly Review of Biophysics

08:18.760 --> 08:25.160
Discovery, QRB Discovery, which is a perfectly respectable peer-reviewed journal.

08:25.160 --> 08:32.400
And for some reason, the Daily Mail posted an embargoed copy of the paper on its website.

08:32.400 --> 08:37.080
Straight away that struck me as fishy, as I mentioned to someone else who asked me about

08:37.080 --> 08:38.680
this paper.

08:38.680 --> 08:43.560
Because I often get embargoed papers sent to me, it's very common in the media, and

08:43.560 --> 08:48.140
the whole point of an embargo is that it gives a journalist time to read the paper

08:48.140 --> 08:50.340
and write up the story.

08:50.340 --> 08:55.620
But a news organisation isn't supposed to post the story until after the paper has been

08:55.620 --> 08:57.420
published.

08:57.420 --> 09:02.220
Here the Mail is not only posting a story prior to publication, it's posting a copy

09:02.220 --> 09:04.340
of the paper itself.

09:04.340 --> 09:09.540
I've never seen this happen, so it's quite bizarre.

09:09.540 --> 09:13.380
That aside, what's the evidence shown in the alleged paper?

09:13.400 --> 09:18.280
According to the Daily Mail, the authors found a fingerprint that shows the SARS-CoV-2 virus

09:18.280 --> 09:24.280
couldn't be natural, because it has four positively charged amino acids in a row.

09:24.280 --> 09:29.560
It's rare to find even three in a row in naturally occurring organisms, while four

09:29.560 --> 09:33.700
in a row is extremely unlikely, the scientists said.

09:33.700 --> 09:39.520
The laws of physics mean that you cannot have four positively charged amino acids in a row.

09:39.520 --> 09:47.100
The only way you can get this is if you artificially manufacture it, Dalglish told Dailymail.com.

09:47.100 --> 09:50.020
But this was very easy to check.

09:50.020 --> 09:54.140
One of the posters on my forum said it didn't take him long to find several instances of

09:54.140 --> 10:00.060
four positively charged amino acids in a row in naturally occurring viruses.

10:00.060 --> 10:03.460
I checked his sources, and I found them too.

10:03.460 --> 10:08.980
In two papers I did a simple search for four positively charged amino acids and came up

10:08.980 --> 10:11.040
with several results.

10:11.040 --> 10:14.440
So much for this supposed law of physics.

10:14.440 --> 10:19.800
So why would a reputable peer-reviewed journal like the QRB Discovery be willing to publish

10:19.800 --> 10:21.440
such obvious twaddle?

10:21.440 --> 10:22.440
Answer?

10:22.440 --> 10:24.660
You're ahead of me.

10:24.660 --> 10:26.240
Of course it wasn't.

10:26.240 --> 10:30.540
The Daily Mail's claim that this study was about to be published in that journal, or

10:30.540 --> 10:33.200
any journal, was nonsense.

10:33.200 --> 10:37.500
They simply took the author's word for it, without bothering to check with the journal's

10:37.500 --> 10:38.500
editor.

10:39.220 --> 10:44.280
Once it became clear a few weeks later that this imminent publication wasn't happening,

10:44.280 --> 10:48.360
the Daily Mail removed the name of the journal from the story.

10:48.360 --> 10:50.660
But the damage had already been done.

10:50.660 --> 10:56.460
Hundreds of news sites, blogs and fora had reprinted the Daily Mail claim that this was

10:56.460 --> 11:02.620
a legitimate study about to be published in the QRB Discovery, again without bothering

11:02.620 --> 11:04.700
to check.

11:04.880 --> 11:08.720
Neither did they check the spurious evidence that you can't get four positively charged

11:08.720 --> 11:13.940
amino acids in a row, which is still up there on the Mail website.

11:13.940 --> 11:19.180
You have to go a long way down the Daily Mail story, past the photos and the clickbait to

11:19.180 --> 11:26.420
discover that virologists dismiss this unpublished claim as magical and explain that this amino

11:26.420 --> 11:30.040
acid conjunction is often found in nature.

11:30.080 --> 11:35.160
Unfortunately, that glimpse of reality is in a box relaying how Sorensen et al have

11:35.160 --> 11:41.160
been thwarted in previous publication efforts, not because their essay is bunk, but by a

11:41.160 --> 11:44.760
conspiracy of scientists to silence them.

11:44.760 --> 11:49.720
Next, there was a claim that the lab leak theory had gained credibility because of a

11:49.720 --> 11:52.360
study by Piplani et al.

11:52.360 --> 11:57.560
I think what they mean is that the man-made virus theory had gained credibility since

11:57.560 --> 12:03.320
the study wasn't about a lab leak, it was about how well adapted SARS-CoV-2 is to human

12:03.320 --> 12:04.920
cells.

12:04.920 --> 12:10.820
The authors found that SARS-CoV-2 binds very tightly to human ACE2, the entry point for

12:10.820 --> 12:14.320
coronaviruses into the human body.

12:14.320 --> 12:19.640
Their conclusion is that if the virus is well adapted to human ACE2 it couldn't have jumped

12:19.640 --> 12:24.340
directly from bats to humans, so the authors looked at various candidates that might have

12:24.340 --> 12:29.300
acted as intermediate species, and although some looked promising, they couldn't find

12:29.300 --> 12:31.160
a perfect match.

12:31.160 --> 12:35.340
Which means we're back to where we started, the intermediate species still hasn't been

12:35.340 --> 12:41.540
found, we don't know where the virus came from, and that vacuum of knowledge is what's

12:41.540 --> 12:44.700
been quickly filled with speculation.

12:44.700 --> 12:50.500
So why is it very unlikely that this affinity for human ACE2 is the result of deliberate

12:50.500 --> 12:53.300
manipulation in a lab?

12:53.300 --> 12:57.300
And apart from the reasons already covered, researchers have found that the virus seems

12:57.300 --> 13:03.680
to have evolved in the presence of a human immune system, in other words, naturally.

13:03.680 --> 13:09.140
And the way it binds to ACE2, like so many other things in the SARS-CoV-2 virus, is a

13:09.140 --> 13:14.860
bit messy and counter-intuitive, an intelligent designer wouldn't have designed it that way,

13:14.860 --> 13:17.460
but evolution frequently does.

13:17.460 --> 13:22.200
Finally, another thing that's new is that we've had the email from a senior researcher

13:22.200 --> 13:27.120
at the Scripps Institute saying that one really small part of the genome looks potentially

13:27.120 --> 13:32.760
engineered, but a team of researchers is going to look at it critically, and further analysis

13:32.760 --> 13:37.640
needs to be done, and they should know more by the end of the weekend.

13:37.640 --> 13:41.280
And it turned out that when they did look at it more critically, they discovered that

13:41.280 --> 13:44.760
the virus bore all the hallmarks of being natural.

13:44.760 --> 13:49.320
At least that's what the team, researchers from five different universities and scientific

13:49.320 --> 13:54.560
institutes from three different countries, concluded in Nature Medicine.

13:54.560 --> 13:59.740
So does this mean that the researcher's initial impression had to be correct, and that any

13:59.740 --> 14:04.160
change must therefore be the result of corruption and dishonesty?

14:04.160 --> 14:09.900
Or does it mean that initial impressions in science are often overturned as research continues

14:09.900 --> 14:12.720
and more evidence is found?

14:12.720 --> 14:17.320
I can't claim to know the answer to that one either, so feel free to speculate on your

14:17.320 --> 14:18.600
own.

14:18.600 --> 14:23.640
All I can tell you is that I've been reporting on scientific research for over three decades,

14:23.640 --> 14:27.360
and I don't find such changes at all surprising.

14:27.360 --> 14:32.100
In fact, I've reported this on my channel before, when a rather crude estimate of past

14:32.100 --> 14:36.920
temperatures was improved as better data became available.

14:36.920 --> 14:42.340
That update led to howls of protest because the latest information didn't fit what a lot

14:42.340 --> 14:45.280
of people wanted to believe.

14:45.280 --> 14:49.200
The bottom line is that there are a lot of questions that we still don't have answers

14:49.200 --> 14:54.460
to, and I wish I could make something up for you, like so many others are doing.

14:54.460 --> 14:58.560
In fact, a lot of the theories that are coming out of this speculation are simply throwing

14:58.560 --> 15:01.480
up more questions that don't have answers.

15:01.480 --> 15:06.020
All I can do is check some of the claims that are bouncing around the internet and weed

15:06.020 --> 15:08.160
out the ones that are bullcrap.

15:08.160 --> 15:10.580
I hope that helps.

15:10.580 --> 15:15.060
Asking lots of questions and then speculating and offering opinion is fine.

15:15.060 --> 15:19.860
If you enjoy that kind of thing, but I'd rather not join the pack.

15:19.860 --> 15:23.000
Of course, we do need to know where the virus came from.

15:23.000 --> 15:29.060
But a definitive answer will only come from solid evidence, not misquotes, changed documents,

15:29.060 --> 15:35.400
fake dossiers, exaggerations, fabrications, misrepresentations and magical facts dreamed

15:35.400 --> 15:38.380
up in published papers that don't exist.

15:38.380 --> 15:44.180
It won't come from circumstantial evidence, suspicions, guesswork or possibilities either,

15:44.180 --> 15:50.400
unless and until the questions thrown up by this speculation are themselves answered.

15:50.400 --> 15:54.960
But of course, that's not going to stop people pointlessly speculating.

15:54.960 --> 16:00.000
These pundits always love to put quotes alongside their speculation to give it some kind of

16:00.000 --> 16:02.420
intellectual legitimacy.

16:02.420 --> 16:07.820
So I'm going to leave you with the wise words of that much overlooked philosopher and 20th

16:07.820 --> 16:11.900
century intellectual giant, Ryan O'Neill, who said this.

16:11.900 --> 16:15.620
Anything is possible, but possible don't make it true.

16:41.900 --> 16:42.900
Thank you.

16:42.900 --> 16:42.900
