1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:19,720
For a hundred thousand years, humans have looked up at the night sky and wondered about

2
00:00:19,720 --> 00:00:22,160
those awesome points of light.

3
00:00:22,160 --> 00:00:23,160
What are they?

4
00:00:23,160 --> 00:00:24,300
What are they made of?

5
00:00:24,300 --> 00:00:26,480
How did they get there?

6
00:00:26,480 --> 00:00:31,100
They didn't have the technology to find out, so they guessed that magical beings had created

7
00:00:31,100 --> 00:00:32,280
it all.

8
00:00:32,280 --> 00:00:37,520
If you prefer making wild guesses instead of using observation, measurement and calculation,

9
00:00:37,520 --> 00:00:39,480
then here's a sealed box.

10
00:00:39,480 --> 00:00:43,440
Spend the next ten minutes guessing what's inside and come back again at the end of this

11
00:00:43,440 --> 00:00:44,880
video.

12
00:00:44,880 --> 00:00:49,720
Because this video doesn't cover what we guess about the universe, but what we know, and

13
00:00:49,720 --> 00:00:52,440
more importantly, how we know it.

14
00:00:52,440 --> 00:01:01,060
How do we know where the stars and galaxies came from and how old they are?

15
00:01:01,060 --> 00:01:04,960
The first person to take a stab at gauging the scale of the world around him was the

16
00:01:04,960 --> 00:01:08,340
Greek scientist Eratosthenes of Cyrene.

17
00:01:08,340 --> 00:01:13,000
He knew that on the longest day of the year, the sun was directly overhead at Syene in

18
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:17,480
the south of Egypt, but cast a shadow in Alexandria to the north.

19
00:01:17,480 --> 00:01:22,260
By measuring the length of the shadow, he could work out the Earth's diameter.

20
00:01:22,260 --> 00:01:27,260
And while the Earth might be spherical, the dogma of a fixed Earth still held sway, backed

21
00:01:27,260 --> 00:01:29,820
by a powerful church.

22
00:01:29,820 --> 00:01:34,520
Problem was, this didn't fit the observable evidence, especially the observation that

23
00:01:34,520 --> 00:01:40,760
some wandering stars, or planets in Greek, had very erratic orbits around the Earth.

24
00:01:40,760 --> 00:01:44,980
When the telescope was invented, these planets turned out to be very different to the fixed

25
00:01:44,980 --> 00:01:46,140
stars.

26
00:01:46,140 --> 00:01:51,260
But it wasn't until Johannes Kepler calculated the exact orbits of the planets that a model

27
00:01:51,260 --> 00:01:54,740
of the solar system at last fit the observations.

28
00:01:54,740 --> 00:02:02,320
His law of planetary motion turned this into this.

29
00:02:02,320 --> 00:02:07,660
In the 18th century, a transit of Venus across the sun, timed at opposite ends of the Earth,

30
00:02:07,660 --> 00:02:12,540
made it possible to calculate the exact distance of the sun, and by extension the distances

31
00:02:12,540 --> 00:02:14,600
of all the known planets.

32
00:02:14,600 --> 00:02:16,980
But that still left the stars.

33
00:02:16,980 --> 00:02:21,080
The easiest way to measure their distance is a system called triangulation, which is

34
00:02:21,080 --> 00:02:23,940
used to measure distant objects on Earth.

35
00:02:23,940 --> 00:02:27,820
With stars, the baseline is the Earth's orbit around the sun.

36
00:02:27,820 --> 00:02:34,900
Take an angle measurement here, and six months later here, and just do the math.

37
00:02:34,900 --> 00:02:39,460
This principle was known in the 17th century, that their instruments simply weren't accurate

38
00:02:39,460 --> 00:02:42,380
enough to measure such a tiny angle.

39
00:02:42,380 --> 00:02:45,740
But in 1838 the technology had caught up.

40
00:02:45,740 --> 00:02:51,140
The Prussian astronomer Bessel found that the binary star 61 Cygni was an astounding

41
00:02:51,140 --> 00:02:53,260
60 trillion miles away.

42
00:02:53,260 --> 00:02:57,440
It was a distance so huge that it had to be measured in terms of the number of years it

43
00:02:57,440 --> 00:03:01,820
took light to cross it, 10.3 light years.

44
00:03:01,820 --> 00:03:05,740
Our universe just got bigger.

45
00:03:05,740 --> 00:03:10,500
Triangulation only works for stars up to 100 light years away, but it was a start.

46
00:03:10,500 --> 00:03:14,780
Knowing the distances of these stars, astronomers could work out the relationship between a

47
00:03:14,820 --> 00:03:19,900
star's distance and its brightness, because closer stars are generally brighter than distant

48
00:03:19,900 --> 00:03:21,340
ones.

49
00:03:21,340 --> 00:03:25,500
Using this calculation, they could now estimate the distance of the faintest stars they could

50
00:03:25,500 --> 00:03:26,500
see.

51
00:03:26,500 --> 00:03:30,380
It was only an estimate, but our universe got bigger again.

52
00:03:30,380 --> 00:03:35,940
We seemed to be on the edge of a huge wheel of stars in space.

53
00:03:35,940 --> 00:03:40,220
While the brightness of a star gives us an estimate of its distance, confirmation comes

54
00:03:40,220 --> 00:03:43,020
in another trick of triangulation.

55
00:03:43,020 --> 00:03:47,060
In 1987, a star was seen to explode inside our galaxy.

56
00:03:47,060 --> 00:03:51,740
The exploding star is called a supernova, and it's very bright.

57
00:03:51,740 --> 00:03:56,560
As it happened, this particular supernova was surrounded by a huge gas cloud far out

58
00:03:56,560 --> 00:03:57,900
into space.

59
00:03:57,900 --> 00:04:03,260
The light from the exploding supernova raced across the gap, and eight months later it

60
00:04:03,260 --> 00:04:05,460
hit the surrounding gas cloud.

61
00:04:05,460 --> 00:04:08,980
Cosmologists saw the reflective glow.

62
00:04:08,980 --> 00:04:13,220
We know the speed of light, so we know how far it can travel in eight months.

63
00:04:13,220 --> 00:04:17,520
And that means we know the distance between the supernova and the gas cloud.

64
00:04:17,520 --> 00:04:22,140
All cosmologists had to do is measure the angle between the two, as seen from Earth,

65
00:04:22,140 --> 00:04:25,020
and once again its simple triangulation.

66
00:04:25,020 --> 00:04:30,780
We can work out the distance of the supernova, 169,000 light years.

67
00:04:30,780 --> 00:04:37,660
That means we're looking at an event that happened 169,000 years ago.

68
00:04:37,660 --> 00:04:39,900
The universe was now huge.

69
00:04:39,900 --> 00:04:45,900
By simply observing and measuring, we'd calculated a scale in time and space that was far greater

70
00:04:45,900 --> 00:04:49,220
than Bronze Age people ever imagined.

71
00:04:49,220 --> 00:04:52,320
But one question still confounded scientists.

72
00:04:52,320 --> 00:04:54,980
What are all these stars made of?

73
00:04:54,980 --> 00:04:59,340
To understand the evidence, we have to understand the atom.

74
00:04:59,340 --> 00:05:03,260
There are around 92 different types of atom, known as elements.

75
00:05:03,260 --> 00:05:07,580
They differ in the number of electrons, protons and neutrons they have.

76
00:05:07,580 --> 00:05:12,340
When an atom emits light, it absorbs the light of particular wavelengths.

77
00:05:12,340 --> 00:05:15,980
Each element absorbs a different set of wavelengths.

78
00:05:15,980 --> 00:05:20,100
We can see these absorption patterns as lines when we look through an instrument called

79
00:05:20,100 --> 00:05:21,700
a spectroscope.

80
00:05:21,700 --> 00:05:25,820
This one shows the spectral lines of three elements that were very familiar to early

81
00:05:25,820 --> 00:05:30,940
19th century scientists, hydrogen, lithium and oxygen.

82
00:05:30,940 --> 00:05:36,940
But when the French astronomer Pierre Janssen pointed a spectroscope at the Sun in 1868,

83
00:05:36,940 --> 00:05:40,740
he found a set of spectral lines no one had ever seen before.

84
00:05:40,740 --> 00:05:43,340
It was a completely unknown element.

85
00:05:43,340 --> 00:05:47,620
He called it helium, after the Greek word helios, the Sun.

86
00:05:47,620 --> 00:05:53,660
The new element also showed up in stars, along with another abundant element, hydrogen.

87
00:05:53,660 --> 00:05:57,780
Inside this tightly bound universe, which they called the galaxy, astronomers could

88
00:05:57,780 --> 00:06:01,420
see strange swirling clouds through their telescopes.

89
00:06:01,420 --> 00:06:06,380
Some astronomers thought these could be other galaxies, just like our own.

90
00:06:06,380 --> 00:06:12,900
In 1917, a supernova was seen to explode inside a cloud called Andromeda.

91
00:06:12,900 --> 00:06:17,460
Supernovas are usually very bright, but this one was quite faint.

92
00:06:17,460 --> 00:06:22,780
Using the brightness and distance calculation, cosmologists work out just how far away Andromeda

93
00:06:22,780 --> 00:06:25,780
was, two million light years.

94
00:06:25,780 --> 00:06:31,780
That put it well outside our own galaxy, and triangulation showed just how big it was,

95
00:06:31,780 --> 00:06:34,140
about the size of our own galaxy.

96
00:06:34,140 --> 00:06:39,460
The universe, it turned out, extended well beyond our own cluster of stars, and millions

97
00:06:39,460 --> 00:06:42,740
of years back in time.

98
00:06:42,740 --> 00:06:47,700
American astronomer Edwin Hubble soon discovered that other galaxies were even further away.

99
00:06:47,700 --> 00:06:52,660
He also confirmed an observation that they were all moving away from us at incredible

100
00:06:52,660 --> 00:06:53,660
speed.

101
00:06:53,660 --> 00:06:56,260
Those furthest away were going the fastest.

102
00:06:56,260 --> 00:07:03,140
In other words, our universe was expanding, as if we were caught up in a huge explosion.

103
00:07:03,140 --> 00:07:04,700
How do we know this?

104
00:07:04,700 --> 00:07:07,820
I'll explain with a more prosaic example.

105
00:07:07,820 --> 00:07:12,660
When you watch a car speed past sounding its horn, the pitch seems to change.

106
00:07:12,660 --> 00:07:16,660
As it's coming towards you, the sound waves are bunched up, so the horn seems to have

107
00:07:16,660 --> 00:07:19,100
a high pitch.

108
00:07:19,100 --> 00:07:23,940
As it passes by, the pitch suddenly drops, because now the sound waves are being stretched

109
00:07:23,940 --> 00:07:25,220
out.

110
00:07:25,220 --> 00:07:27,380
This is called the Doppler effect.

111
00:07:27,380 --> 00:07:32,020
Just by measuring the change in pitch, an observer can calculate the speed of the car,

112
00:07:32,020 --> 00:07:35,660
and whether it's coming towards him, or moving away.

113
00:07:35,660 --> 00:07:40,120
We can do the same with stars and galaxies, using light instead of sound.

114
00:07:40,120 --> 00:07:45,680
If a galaxy is moving away, the spectral lines will shift towards the red end of the spectrum.

115
00:07:45,680 --> 00:07:50,580
The opposite happens if a galaxy is coming closer, they move towards the blue end.

116
00:07:50,580 --> 00:07:55,260
So cosmologists could not only calculate which direction the galaxies are moving, but also

117
00:07:55,260 --> 00:07:57,320
their speed.

118
00:07:57,320 --> 00:08:02,840
If we reverse the course of these galaxies and wind the film back, space itself contracts

119
00:08:02,840 --> 00:08:07,440
back to a single point, just under 14 billion years ago.

120
00:08:07,440 --> 00:08:10,560
The start of this expansion is called the Big Bang.

121
00:08:10,560 --> 00:08:16,360
That's as far as we've got so far in our understanding of the scale and time span of the universe.

122
00:08:16,360 --> 00:08:20,880
Research is now continuing to discover what happened before the Big Bang.

123
00:08:20,880 --> 00:08:23,480
Now let's come back to that sealed box.

124
00:08:23,480 --> 00:08:27,760
For the people who decided to skip the video in order to speculate on the contents, have

125
00:08:27,760 --> 00:08:30,160
you figured out what's inside yet?

126
00:08:30,160 --> 00:08:31,360
Of course not.

127
00:08:31,360 --> 00:08:35,200
Sitting in an armchair and making wild guesses tells you nothing.

128
00:08:35,200 --> 00:08:39,360
You're really no better off than the Bronze Age farmers who looked up at the stars and

129
00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:41,780
tried to guess what they were.

130
00:08:41,780 --> 00:08:45,800
Just because the Big Bang is the current extent of our knowledge, doesn't mean we've reached

131
00:08:45,800 --> 00:08:47,480
the end of the story.

132
00:08:47,480 --> 00:08:51,720
Every time in history people thought they knew the scale of the universe, they've always

133
00:08:51,720 --> 00:08:53,960
been proved wrong.

134
00:08:53,960 --> 00:08:59,280
To me the real story of the universe is way more interesting than myths and fairy tales.

135
00:08:59,280 --> 00:09:04,980
For 100,000 years humans have stared up at the same night sky and wondered.

136
00:09:04,980 --> 00:09:10,120
We are the first people in human history not to wonder, not to guess, but to know.

137
00:09:21,720 --> 00:09:23,800
you
