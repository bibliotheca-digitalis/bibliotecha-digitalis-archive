0	19720	For a hundred thousand years, humans have looked up at the night sky and wondered about
19720	22160	those awesome points of light.
22160	23160	What are they?
23160	24300	What are they made of?
24300	26480	How did they get there?
26480	31100	They didn't have the technology to find out, so they guessed that magical beings had created
31100	32280	it all.
32280	37520	If you prefer making wild guesses instead of using observation, measurement and calculation,
37520	39480	then here's a sealed box.
39480	43440	Spend the next ten minutes guessing what's inside and come back again at the end of this
43440	44880	video.
44880	49720	Because this video doesn't cover what we guess about the universe, but what we know, and
49720	52440	more importantly, how we know it.
52440	61060	How do we know where the stars and galaxies came from and how old they are?
61060	64960	The first person to take a stab at gauging the scale of the world around him was the
64960	68340	Greek scientist Eratosthenes of Cyrene.
68340	73000	He knew that on the longest day of the year, the sun was directly overhead at Syene in
73000	77480	the south of Egypt, but cast a shadow in Alexandria to the north.
77480	82260	By measuring the length of the shadow, he could work out the Earth's diameter.
82260	87260	And while the Earth might be spherical, the dogma of a fixed Earth still held sway, backed
87260	89820	by a powerful church.
89820	94520	Problem was, this didn't fit the observable evidence, especially the observation that
94520	100760	some wandering stars, or planets in Greek, had very erratic orbits around the Earth.
100760	104980	When the telescope was invented, these planets turned out to be very different to the fixed
104980	106140	stars.
106140	111260	But it wasn't until Johannes Kepler calculated the exact orbits of the planets that a model
111260	114740	of the solar system at last fit the observations.
114740	122320	His law of planetary motion turned this into this.
122320	127660	In the 18th century, a transit of Venus across the sun, timed at opposite ends of the Earth,
127660	132540	made it possible to calculate the exact distance of the sun, and by extension the distances
132540	134600	of all the known planets.
134600	136980	But that still left the stars.
136980	141080	The easiest way to measure their distance is a system called triangulation, which is
141080	143940	used to measure distant objects on Earth.
143940	147820	With stars, the baseline is the Earth's orbit around the sun.
147820	154900	Take an angle measurement here, and six months later here, and just do the math.
154900	159460	This principle was known in the 17th century, that their instruments simply weren't accurate
159460	162380	enough to measure such a tiny angle.
162380	165740	But in 1838 the technology had caught up.
165740	171140	The Prussian astronomer Bessel found that the binary star 61 Cygni was an astounding
171140	173260	60 trillion miles away.
173260	177440	It was a distance so huge that it had to be measured in terms of the number of years it
177440	181820	took light to cross it, 10.3 light years.
181820	185740	Our universe just got bigger.
185740	190500	Triangulation only works for stars up to 100 light years away, but it was a start.
190500	194780	Knowing the distances of these stars, astronomers could work out the relationship between a
194820	199900	star's distance and its brightness, because closer stars are generally brighter than distant
199900	201340	ones.
201340	205500	Using this calculation, they could now estimate the distance of the faintest stars they could
205500	206500	see.
206500	210380	It was only an estimate, but our universe got bigger again.
210380	215940	We seemed to be on the edge of a huge wheel of stars in space.
215940	220220	While the brightness of a star gives us an estimate of its distance, confirmation comes
220220	223020	in another trick of triangulation.
223020	227060	In 1987, a star was seen to explode inside our galaxy.
227060	231740	The exploding star is called a supernova, and it's very bright.
231740	236560	As it happened, this particular supernova was surrounded by a huge gas cloud far out
236560	237900	into space.
237900	243260	The light from the exploding supernova raced across the gap, and eight months later it
243260	245460	hit the surrounding gas cloud.
245460	248980	Cosmologists saw the reflective glow.
248980	253220	We know the speed of light, so we know how far it can travel in eight months.
253220	257520	And that means we know the distance between the supernova and the gas cloud.
257520	262140	All cosmologists had to do is measure the angle between the two, as seen from Earth,
262140	265020	and once again its simple triangulation.
265020	270780	We can work out the distance of the supernova, 169,000 light years.
270780	277660	That means we're looking at an event that happened 169,000 years ago.
277660	279900	The universe was now huge.
279900	285900	By simply observing and measuring, we'd calculated a scale in time and space that was far greater
285900	289220	than Bronze Age people ever imagined.
289220	292320	But one question still confounded scientists.
292320	294980	What are all these stars made of?
294980	299340	To understand the evidence, we have to understand the atom.
299340	303260	There are around 92 different types of atom, known as elements.
303260	307580	They differ in the number of electrons, protons and neutrons they have.
307580	312340	When an atom emits light, it absorbs the light of particular wavelengths.
312340	315980	Each element absorbs a different set of wavelengths.
315980	320100	We can see these absorption patterns as lines when we look through an instrument called
320100	321700	a spectroscope.
321700	325820	This one shows the spectral lines of three elements that were very familiar to early
325820	330940	19th century scientists, hydrogen, lithium and oxygen.
330940	336940	But when the French astronomer Pierre Janssen pointed a spectroscope at the Sun in 1868,
336940	340740	he found a set of spectral lines no one had ever seen before.
340740	343340	It was a completely unknown element.
343340	347620	He called it helium, after the Greek word helios, the Sun.
347620	353660	The new element also showed up in stars, along with another abundant element, hydrogen.
353660	357780	Inside this tightly bound universe, which they called the galaxy, astronomers could
357780	361420	see strange swirling clouds through their telescopes.
361420	366380	Some astronomers thought these could be other galaxies, just like our own.
366380	372900	In 1917, a supernova was seen to explode inside a cloud called Andromeda.
372900	377460	Supernovas are usually very bright, but this one was quite faint.
377460	382780	Using the brightness and distance calculation, cosmologists work out just how far away Andromeda
382780	385780	was, two million light years.
385780	391780	That put it well outside our own galaxy, and triangulation showed just how big it was,
391780	394140	about the size of our own galaxy.
394140	399460	The universe, it turned out, extended well beyond our own cluster of stars, and millions
399460	402740	of years back in time.
402740	407700	American astronomer Edwin Hubble soon discovered that other galaxies were even further away.
407700	412660	He also confirmed an observation that they were all moving away from us at incredible
412660	413660	speed.
413660	416260	Those furthest away were going the fastest.
416260	423140	In other words, our universe was expanding, as if we were caught up in a huge explosion.
423140	424700	How do we know this?
424700	427820	I'll explain with a more prosaic example.
427820	432660	When you watch a car speed past sounding its horn, the pitch seems to change.
432660	436660	As it's coming towards you, the sound waves are bunched up, so the horn seems to have
436660	439100	a high pitch.
439100	443940	As it passes by, the pitch suddenly drops, because now the sound waves are being stretched
443940	445220	out.
445220	447380	This is called the Doppler effect.
447380	452020	Just by measuring the change in pitch, an observer can calculate the speed of the car,
452020	455660	and whether it's coming towards him, or moving away.
455660	460120	We can do the same with stars and galaxies, using light instead of sound.
460120	465680	If a galaxy is moving away, the spectral lines will shift towards the red end of the spectrum.
465680	470580	The opposite happens if a galaxy is coming closer, they move towards the blue end.
470580	475260	So cosmologists could not only calculate which direction the galaxies are moving, but also
475260	477320	their speed.
477320	482840	If we reverse the course of these galaxies and wind the film back, space itself contracts
482840	487440	back to a single point, just under 14 billion years ago.
487440	490560	The start of this expansion is called the Big Bang.
490560	496360	That's as far as we've got so far in our understanding of the scale and time span of the universe.
496360	500880	Research is now continuing to discover what happened before the Big Bang.
500880	503480	Now let's come back to that sealed box.
503480	507760	For the people who decided to skip the video in order to speculate on the contents, have
507760	510160	you figured out what's inside yet?
510160	511360	Of course not.
511360	515200	Sitting in an armchair and making wild guesses tells you nothing.
515200	519360	You're really no better off than the Bronze Age farmers who looked up at the stars and
519360	521780	tried to guess what they were.
521780	525800	Just because the Big Bang is the current extent of our knowledge, doesn't mean we've reached
525800	527480	the end of the story.
527480	531720	Every time in history people thought they knew the scale of the universe, they've always
531720	533960	been proved wrong.
533960	539280	To me the real story of the universe is way more interesting than myths and fairy tales.
539280	544980	For 100,000 years humans have stared up at the same night sky and wondered.
544980	550120	We are the first people in human history not to wonder, not to guess, but to know.
561720	563800	you
