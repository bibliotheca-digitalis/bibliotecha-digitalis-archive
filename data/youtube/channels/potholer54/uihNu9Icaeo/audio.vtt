00:00.000 --> 00:19.720
For a hundred thousand years, humans have looked up at the night sky and wondered about

00:19.720 --> 00:22.160
those awesome points of light.

00:22.160 --> 00:23.160
What are they?

00:23.160 --> 00:24.300
What are they made of?

00:24.300 --> 00:26.480
How did they get there?

00:26.480 --> 00:31.100
They didn't have the technology to find out, so they guessed that magical beings had created

00:31.100 --> 00:32.280
it all.

00:32.280 --> 00:37.520
If you prefer making wild guesses instead of using observation, measurement and calculation,

00:37.520 --> 00:39.480
then here's a sealed box.

00:39.480 --> 00:43.440
Spend the next ten minutes guessing what's inside and come back again at the end of this

00:43.440 --> 00:44.880
video.

00:44.880 --> 00:49.720
Because this video doesn't cover what we guess about the universe, but what we know, and

00:49.720 --> 00:52.440
more importantly, how we know it.

00:52.440 --> 01:01.060
How do we know where the stars and galaxies came from and how old they are?

01:01.060 --> 01:04.960
The first person to take a stab at gauging the scale of the world around him was the

01:04.960 --> 01:08.340
Greek scientist Eratosthenes of Cyrene.

01:08.340 --> 01:13.000
He knew that on the longest day of the year, the sun was directly overhead at Syene in

01:13.000 --> 01:17.480
the south of Egypt, but cast a shadow in Alexandria to the north.

01:17.480 --> 01:22.260
By measuring the length of the shadow, he could work out the Earth's diameter.

01:22.260 --> 01:27.260
And while the Earth might be spherical, the dogma of a fixed Earth still held sway, backed

01:27.260 --> 01:29.820
by a powerful church.

01:29.820 --> 01:34.520
Problem was, this didn't fit the observable evidence, especially the observation that

01:34.520 --> 01:40.760
some wandering stars, or planets in Greek, had very erratic orbits around the Earth.

01:40.760 --> 01:44.980
When the telescope was invented, these planets turned out to be very different to the fixed

01:44.980 --> 01:46.140
stars.

01:46.140 --> 01:51.260
But it wasn't until Johannes Kepler calculated the exact orbits of the planets that a model

01:51.260 --> 01:54.740
of the solar system at last fit the observations.

01:54.740 --> 02:02.320
His law of planetary motion turned this into this.

02:02.320 --> 02:07.660
In the 18th century, a transit of Venus across the sun, timed at opposite ends of the Earth,

02:07.660 --> 02:12.540
made it possible to calculate the exact distance of the sun, and by extension the distances

02:12.540 --> 02:14.600
of all the known planets.

02:14.600 --> 02:16.980
But that still left the stars.

02:16.980 --> 02:21.080
The easiest way to measure their distance is a system called triangulation, which is

02:21.080 --> 02:23.940
used to measure distant objects on Earth.

02:23.940 --> 02:27.820
With stars, the baseline is the Earth's orbit around the sun.

02:27.820 --> 02:34.900
Take an angle measurement here, and six months later here, and just do the math.

02:34.900 --> 02:39.460
This principle was known in the 17th century, that their instruments simply weren't accurate

02:39.460 --> 02:42.380
enough to measure such a tiny angle.

02:42.380 --> 02:45.740
But in 1838 the technology had caught up.

02:45.740 --> 02:51.140
The Prussian astronomer Bessel found that the binary star 61 Cygni was an astounding

02:51.140 --> 02:53.260
60 trillion miles away.

02:53.260 --> 02:57.440
It was a distance so huge that it had to be measured in terms of the number of years it

02:57.440 --> 03:01.820
took light to cross it, 10.3 light years.

03:01.820 --> 03:05.740
Our universe just got bigger.

03:05.740 --> 03:10.500
Triangulation only works for stars up to 100 light years away, but it was a start.

03:10.500 --> 03:14.780
Knowing the distances of these stars, astronomers could work out the relationship between a

03:14.820 --> 03:19.900
star's distance and its brightness, because closer stars are generally brighter than distant

03:19.900 --> 03:21.340
ones.

03:21.340 --> 03:25.500
Using this calculation, they could now estimate the distance of the faintest stars they could

03:25.500 --> 03:26.500
see.

03:26.500 --> 03:30.380
It was only an estimate, but our universe got bigger again.

03:30.380 --> 03:35.940
We seemed to be on the edge of a huge wheel of stars in space.

03:35.940 --> 03:40.220
While the brightness of a star gives us an estimate of its distance, confirmation comes

03:40.220 --> 03:43.020
in another trick of triangulation.

03:43.020 --> 03:47.060
In 1987, a star was seen to explode inside our galaxy.

03:47.060 --> 03:51.740
The exploding star is called a supernova, and it's very bright.

03:51.740 --> 03:56.560
As it happened, this particular supernova was surrounded by a huge gas cloud far out

03:56.560 --> 03:57.900
into space.

03:57.900 --> 04:03.260
The light from the exploding supernova raced across the gap, and eight months later it

04:03.260 --> 04:05.460
hit the surrounding gas cloud.

04:05.460 --> 04:08.980
Cosmologists saw the reflective glow.

04:08.980 --> 04:13.220
We know the speed of light, so we know how far it can travel in eight months.

04:13.220 --> 04:17.520
And that means we know the distance between the supernova and the gas cloud.

04:17.520 --> 04:22.140
All cosmologists had to do is measure the angle between the two, as seen from Earth,

04:22.140 --> 04:25.020
and once again its simple triangulation.

04:25.020 --> 04:30.780
We can work out the distance of the supernova, 169,000 light years.

04:30.780 --> 04:37.660
That means we're looking at an event that happened 169,000 years ago.

04:37.660 --> 04:39.900
The universe was now huge.

04:39.900 --> 04:45.900
By simply observing and measuring, we'd calculated a scale in time and space that was far greater

04:45.900 --> 04:49.220
than Bronze Age people ever imagined.

04:49.220 --> 04:52.320
But one question still confounded scientists.

04:52.320 --> 04:54.980
What are all these stars made of?

04:54.980 --> 04:59.340
To understand the evidence, we have to understand the atom.

04:59.340 --> 05:03.260
There are around 92 different types of atom, known as elements.

05:03.260 --> 05:07.580
They differ in the number of electrons, protons and neutrons they have.

05:07.580 --> 05:12.340
When an atom emits light, it absorbs the light of particular wavelengths.

05:12.340 --> 05:15.980
Each element absorbs a different set of wavelengths.

05:15.980 --> 05:20.100
We can see these absorption patterns as lines when we look through an instrument called

05:20.100 --> 05:21.700
a spectroscope.

05:21.700 --> 05:25.820
This one shows the spectral lines of three elements that were very familiar to early

05:25.820 --> 05:30.940
19th century scientists, hydrogen, lithium and oxygen.

05:30.940 --> 05:36.940
But when the French astronomer Pierre Janssen pointed a spectroscope at the Sun in 1868,

05:36.940 --> 05:40.740
he found a set of spectral lines no one had ever seen before.

05:40.740 --> 05:43.340
It was a completely unknown element.

05:43.340 --> 05:47.620
He called it helium, after the Greek word helios, the Sun.

05:47.620 --> 05:53.660
The new element also showed up in stars, along with another abundant element, hydrogen.

05:53.660 --> 05:57.780
Inside this tightly bound universe, which they called the galaxy, astronomers could

05:57.780 --> 06:01.420
see strange swirling clouds through their telescopes.

06:01.420 --> 06:06.380
Some astronomers thought these could be other galaxies, just like our own.

06:06.380 --> 06:12.900
In 1917, a supernova was seen to explode inside a cloud called Andromeda.

06:12.900 --> 06:17.460
Supernovas are usually very bright, but this one was quite faint.

06:17.460 --> 06:22.780
Using the brightness and distance calculation, cosmologists work out just how far away Andromeda

06:22.780 --> 06:25.780
was, two million light years.

06:25.780 --> 06:31.780
That put it well outside our own galaxy, and triangulation showed just how big it was,

06:31.780 --> 06:34.140
about the size of our own galaxy.

06:34.140 --> 06:39.460
The universe, it turned out, extended well beyond our own cluster of stars, and millions

06:39.460 --> 06:42.740
of years back in time.

06:42.740 --> 06:47.700
American astronomer Edwin Hubble soon discovered that other galaxies were even further away.

06:47.700 --> 06:52.660
He also confirmed an observation that they were all moving away from us at incredible

06:52.660 --> 06:53.660
speed.

06:53.660 --> 06:56.260
Those furthest away were going the fastest.

06:56.260 --> 07:03.140
In other words, our universe was expanding, as if we were caught up in a huge explosion.

07:03.140 --> 07:04.700
How do we know this?

07:04.700 --> 07:07.820
I'll explain with a more prosaic example.

07:07.820 --> 07:12.660
When you watch a car speed past sounding its horn, the pitch seems to change.

07:12.660 --> 07:16.660
As it's coming towards you, the sound waves are bunched up, so the horn seems to have

07:16.660 --> 07:19.100
a high pitch.

07:19.100 --> 07:23.940
As it passes by, the pitch suddenly drops, because now the sound waves are being stretched

07:23.940 --> 07:25.220
out.

07:25.220 --> 07:27.380
This is called the Doppler effect.

07:27.380 --> 07:32.020
Just by measuring the change in pitch, an observer can calculate the speed of the car,

07:32.020 --> 07:35.660
and whether it's coming towards him, or moving away.

07:35.660 --> 07:40.120
We can do the same with stars and galaxies, using light instead of sound.

07:40.120 --> 07:45.680
If a galaxy is moving away, the spectral lines will shift towards the red end of the spectrum.

07:45.680 --> 07:50.580
The opposite happens if a galaxy is coming closer, they move towards the blue end.

07:50.580 --> 07:55.260
So cosmologists could not only calculate which direction the galaxies are moving, but also

07:55.260 --> 07:57.320
their speed.

07:57.320 --> 08:02.840
If we reverse the course of these galaxies and wind the film back, space itself contracts

08:02.840 --> 08:07.440
back to a single point, just under 14 billion years ago.

08:07.440 --> 08:10.560
The start of this expansion is called the Big Bang.

08:10.560 --> 08:16.360
That's as far as we've got so far in our understanding of the scale and time span of the universe.

08:16.360 --> 08:20.880
Research is now continuing to discover what happened before the Big Bang.

08:20.880 --> 08:23.480
Now let's come back to that sealed box.

08:23.480 --> 08:27.760
For the people who decided to skip the video in order to speculate on the contents, have

08:27.760 --> 08:30.160
you figured out what's inside yet?

08:30.160 --> 08:31.360
Of course not.

08:31.360 --> 08:35.200
Sitting in an armchair and making wild guesses tells you nothing.

08:35.200 --> 08:39.360
You're really no better off than the Bronze Age farmers who looked up at the stars and

08:39.360 --> 08:41.780
tried to guess what they were.

08:41.780 --> 08:45.800
Just because the Big Bang is the current extent of our knowledge, doesn't mean we've reached

08:45.800 --> 08:47.480
the end of the story.

08:47.480 --> 08:51.720
Every time in history people thought they knew the scale of the universe, they've always

08:51.720 --> 08:53.960
been proved wrong.

08:53.960 --> 08:59.280
To me the real story of the universe is way more interesting than myths and fairy tales.

08:59.280 --> 09:04.980
For 100,000 years humans have stared up at the same night sky and wondered.

09:04.980 --> 09:10.120
We are the first people in human history not to wonder, not to guess, but to know.

09:21.720 --> 09:23.800
you
