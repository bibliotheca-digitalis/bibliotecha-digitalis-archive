0	14520	I was going to do something on quotes as part of my series on science and the media, and
14520	19600	I was particularly keen on showing a few tricks of the trade by which people can be misquoted.
19600	23200	I wasn't quite sure how much you all knew about this already.
23200	27940	But then two almost identical claims dropped into my message box, which made it clear that
27940	32900	maybe these techniques aren't well understood, because the people who messaged me swore that
32900	39080	Ben Santa, lead author of a chapter in an IPCC report in 1995, had admitted to deleting
39080	44880	a crucial part of the report that said humans were not responsible for recent climate change.
44880	50460	The admission came, they told me, in an interview on the Jesse Ventura conspiracy show.
50460	55100	But it's funny because after they gave me the link, I watched exactly the same interview
55100	57220	and saw no such admission.
57900	61460	Lord Monckton points to deletions from the chapter.
61460	63540	And there were deletions from the chapter.
63540	67900	To be consistent with the other chapters, we dropped the summary at the end.
67900	72280	Now how can we all watch the same thing and come away with a completely different understanding
72280	74020	of what was said?
74020	76700	Well welcome to the wonderful world of television.
76700	82580	After ten years of experiment, television, first shown to the public at the World's Fair,
82580	86980	now takes its place as a new American art and industry.
86980	91540	I guess I saw things differently because I've conducted scores of interviews for television,
91540	95760	so when I watch an interview now, I'm not just listening to what's said, I'm looking
95760	99580	to see where the cuts are made and where the cameras are positioned.
99580	102580	And it's these insights I want to share with you.
102580	107140	But television is just one journalistic medium, so let's start with the medium I started in,
107140	108840	which is print.
108840	113560	And let's take this 60 Minutes interview with WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange as an example
113560	114740	of a typical interview.
114740	120100	There is a special set of rules in the United States for disclosing classified information.
120100	121100	There is.
121100	122100	Long standing.
122100	131600	There is a special set of rules for soldiers, for members of the State Department who are
131600	132600	disclosing classified information.
132600	138300	There is not a special set of rules for publishers who disclose classified information.
138300	142740	Clearly Assange is saying that there is no special set of rules for publishers disclosing
142740	147780	classified information, which is the argument he uses to claim that publishing leaked material
147780	149940	is perfectly legal.
149940	155140	Now this is how the verbatim quote actually looks, but if I was writing a story for print,
155140	159340	this would be too long and too cumbersome to put directly into a story.
159340	164100	So I'd cut it down to Assange's basic point and quote him like this.
164100	168940	The ellipse shows that I've cut some words, and the parenthesis shows that I've substituted
168940	172760	a shorter word, again without changing the meaning.
172760	177440	If Assange saw this edited quote, he'd probably agree that it's in perfect accord with his
177440	179540	intent and meaning.
179540	183980	But if I was a less honest journalist working for a newspaper intent on pushing a political
183980	189440	line, I could quite easily make a cut that changes Assange's meaning completely.
189440	193560	And if I wanted to erase all trace of the edit I made, I wouldn't bother putting in
193560	194980	the ellipse.
194980	199580	This is what people would read in my newspaper, and they'd assume it's exactly what Assange
199580	200820	said.
200820	205420	So without knowing what the interviewee actually said, how can you spot the difference between
205420	210340	editing that's done to save space, while retaining the meaning, and dishonest editing that's
210340	212140	done to manipulate the meaning?
212140	216220	Well, there are lots of ways to tell from the wording, something I won't have time to
216220	217700	go into here.
217700	221600	But your suspicions should be aroused when an interviewee suddenly says something that
221600	225360	completely contradicts everything he said before.
225360	230240	For Assange to declare that publishing classified material is illegal, when for months he's
230240	233800	been insisting it's legal, would be extraordinary.
233800	237840	And only a journalist with a brain the size of a donut would let an admission like that
237840	241440	slip by without pushing for more details.
241440	245840	If Assange was doing this interview for radio, then a different technique is used.
245840	248480	Obviously, ellipses don't work here.
248480	253640	A long quote can simply be pieced together from bits of sentences throughout the interview.
253640	257640	That's fine if it's done for time purposes and retains the meaning.
257640	260880	But in unscrupulous hands, often it's not.
260880	265760	Let's start with what Assange actually said, this time using sound editing software.
265760	274760	There's a special set of rules for soldiers, for members of the State Department who are
274760	275880	disclosing classified information.
275880	281320	There's not a special set of rules for publishers who disclose classified information.
281320	287480	Now with a bit of judicious editing, here's what we can make him say.
287480	293860	There's a special set of rules for publishers who disclose classified information.
293860	298760	The same sort of thing can be done with TV, but with television there's a problem.
298760	303520	If I simply take one part of Assange's quote and paste it together with another part, the
303520	307440	sound might be seamless, but there would be an obvious jump in the picture.
307440	313840	There's a special set of rules for publishers who disclose classified information.
313840	318220	Now some TV networks are okay with this, and it's an honest admission that something has
318220	321380	been cut, just like the newspaper ellipse.
321380	325760	But if a lot of edits have to be made, as so often happens, just to get a continuous
325760	330960	sentence, and since television likes to cast an illusion that hates this kind of interruption,
330960	334140	TV journalists have a trick to get around it.
334140	339160	Now watch my dishonest edit again, this time the way it would be presented on a TV show.
339160	345680	There's a special set of rules for publishers who disclose classified information.
345680	350220	To the casual viewer it looks as though Assange has continued talking without a break.
350220	354080	This is called a cutaway, or specifically a reverse.
354080	359200	A cutaway could be anything, from Assange walking in the garden to a shot of a WikiLeaks
359200	360280	page.
360280	364760	But the most common type of cutaway is the reverse, or what Australian TV journalists
364760	370160	call noddies, because they're quick and easy, and make the cut less obvious.
370160	374760	You can go to the cutaway, do the audio edit, and then come back to the interviewee, and
374760	377040	it sounds as though nothing has been skipped.
377040	382960	There's a special set of rules for publishers who disclose classified information.
382960	387060	But in half a second, we've changed Assange's meaning completely.
387060	393540	These reverses happen so often in TV interviews, a passive viewer would hardly notice them.
393540	397580	How many cuts can you see in this short clip from the 60 Minutes interview?
397580	399260	What statements are you referring to?
399260	407260	The statements by the Vice President, Biden, saying, for instance, that I was a high-tech
407260	408660	terrorist.
408660	413100	Sarah Palin calling to our organisation to be dealt with like the Taliban and be hunted
413100	414100	down.
414100	419540	These are rules either for my assassination or the assassination of my staff, or for us
419540	424620	to be kidnapped and renditioned back to the United States to be executed.
424620	428620	If you said three, congratulations, you'd be wrong.
428620	430140	There were actually six.
430140	433100	Okay, three of them were in the cutaways.
433100	437180	The editor isn't cutting to Steve Croft here, because he's reacting to something Assange
437180	441660	said, or because he's interjecting, or because he's got such a pretty face, we just can't
441660	442900	get enough of it.
442900	445080	This is an edit of the audio.
445080	447900	But let me explain the other three.
447900	452260	Cameras and camera crews are expensive, much more so in the past when networks used to
452260	456540	cut costs by having just one camera, focused on the interviewee.
456540	459420	The interviewer would be filmed when the interview was over.
459420	463700	It meant he had to sit in front of the camera, staring at nothing and looking interested,
463700	467780	even repeating the same questions that were put during the interview, in order to get
467780	469460	some cutaways.
469460	473860	So these days it's common to have two cameras, and with the Assange interview, a third camera
473860	478900	was taking a wide shot, allowing more variety in the way the cuts are made.
478900	483740	Here we go from a close-up to a wide shot, and that's where something's been cut.
483740	487060	When we go back to the close-up, that's another edit.
487060	490860	This one is so obvious it can even be heard in the audio alone.
490860	496500	Or for us to be kidnapped and renditioned back to the United States to be executed.
496540	500860	One reason for that is that an audio recording isn't consistent throughout an interview.
500860	505100	The tone of an interviewee's voice will change, and even the quality of the recording will
505100	509380	change as he shifts his head slightly in relation to the microphone.
509380	513860	Or his words might be so close together that even a precise edit will push one word too
513860	516140	close to the edit point.
516140	520100	That's obviously the case with the sixth edit, where the camera cuts to Assange at the end
520100	524620	of Steve Croft's question, leaving out the first part of his opening line.
525060	532060	So how would an unscrupulous journalist get around the problem of one word butting right
532060	534020	up against another?
534020	538540	Let's use another 60 Minutes interview, this time with a faster-talking Mark Zuckerberg,
538540	540780	to see how this could be done.
540780	544860	By the way, the cutaway here to Lesley Stahl isn't done to cut anything Zuckerberg said
544860	546740	– it's a reaction shot.
546740	552020	Without it, you'd just hear Stahl's reaction off-camera, which would sound a little weird.
552020	555660	Now what I'll show you in the text are the words I want to extract from the Zuckerberg
555660	558260	interview for my fabricated quote.
572260	576500	So here's the clip I want to end up with, deleting a large chunk of what Zuckerberg
576500	578100	said in between.
578100	581540	Now if we go to the audio and make the cut I want, you can see the problem.
581580	586940	However precisely I make the cut, one word will always butt up against another.
586940	589940	Even with the benefit of a cutaway, you can clearly hear the edit.
589940	593540	It's funny, I mean, when I was getting started, you know, with my roommates building stuff
593540	595100	because we thought it was cool.
595100	599580	Most ethical networks would just let that go, just as 60 Minutes did with Assange's
599580	603820	obvious edits, because the only way to get around it is to do something that has to be
603820	606060	regarded as deliberately deceptive.
606060	610420	Let's go to the Zuckerberg audio track again to see how it's done.
610500	614660	Since the problem is that the words come too close together, I could of course just separate
614660	618300	them with a fraction of a second's silence, a simple pause.
618300	621660	It's funny, I mean, when I was getting started, you know, with my roommates building stuff
621660	623780	because we thought it was cool, I do...
623780	627340	But this sounds artificial and makes the cut even more obvious.
627340	629140	So here's the trick.
629140	633860	Instead of silence, we copy a pause for breath from another part of the interview and simply
633860	636780	insert it where we made the edit.
636780	639140	Now listen to how natural that sounds.
639140	642660	It's funny, I mean, when I was getting started, you know, with my roommates building stuff
642660	645980	because we thought it was cool, I do remember having...
645980	651100	And when we mask the audio with a cutaway, the cut is imperceptible to the casual viewer.
651100	654620	It's funny, I mean, when I was getting started, you know, with my roommates building stuff
654620	656180	because we thought it was cool...
656180	660700	Editing interviews and using cutaways is something every television journalist does.
660700	665580	But every cut we make has to be weighed carefully to ensure it's done for time reasons alone
665580	669260	and doesn't change an interviewee's intent or meaning.
669260	672340	Which brings us back to Jesse Ventura's conspiracy program.
672340	676860	Jesse Ventura and his team are hot on the trail of a conspiracy to use the issue of
676860	679940	global warming to control your life.
679940	683620	Look again at that Santa interview with a more practised eye.
683620	688180	Lord Moncton points to deletions from the chapter and there were deletions from the
688180	689260	chapter.
689260	693180	To be consistent with the other chapters, we dropped the summary at the end.
693180	695040	Do you see it now?
695040	700600	That's right, the explanation Santa gave about the deletions was, ironically, itself
700600	701600	deleted.
701600	706560	Instead, the program goes to a cutaway and another part of Santa's interview is inserted
706560	708180	in its place.
708180	712120	If we listen to the first part of the clip before the edit, it sounds as though Santa's
712120	714920	about to explain what the deletions were.
714920	719520	Lord Moncton points to deletions from the chapter and there were deletions from the
719520	721520	chapter.
722000	724000	But...
724000	725000	And...
725000	726400	What?
726400	728440	We already know there were deletions.
728440	732060	Santa said fifteen years ago that changes were made to the chapter.
732060	735840	The controversy is about what those deletions were.
735840	739720	But for some reason we don't get to hear the rest of Santa's sentence.
739720	742720	It's um... deleted.
742720	746880	Now maybe Santa didn't go on to explain what the deletions were.
746880	750520	But if that's the case, then why didn't the interviewer ask him?
750520	752840	After all, that's the whole point of the interview.
752840	757360	It's the one thing the show and its audience want to know.
757360	761600	The result of this clever editing is that a lot of bloggers, completely oblivious to
761600	768240	the cutaway, are quoting Santa as if this is what he actually said.
768240	772920	And even adding things they thought he said.
772920	775040	That's the power of television.
775040	780080	Producers know what their target audience wants to hear and the film can be edited accordingly.
780080	784940	If you want to make a TV series called Quest for Lost Civilizations, for example, then
784940	788880	you really have to give your audience lost civilizations.
788880	793240	Now this is the point in my original video where I took a look at the TV series Quest
793240	796880	for the Lost Civilization by Graham Hancock.
796880	800920	It was shown on Channel 4, which seems to believe that any old nonsense should be shown
800920	805880	on TV, as long as it stirs up controversy and gets ratings.
805880	810560	And one of the best ways to do this is to take a counter-cultural view and sell it like
810560	812240	a soap product.
812240	816800	But when I want to show how this has been done, I'm not allowed to do that because the
816800	819320	film is copyright.
819320	823680	That's why you can't see my original video in the UK and Ireland.
823680	827840	But here's a brief summary using just still pictures and a bit of audio.
827840	832360	Hancock's belief is that 12,000 years ago there was an advanced civilization stretching
832360	837320	right around the world, and that it was submerged after the last ice age.
837320	841080	One of the places he thinks he's found this is off the island of Yonaguni in the western
841080	842080	Pacific.
842080	846140	On the other side of the Pacific Ocean there's exciting evidence of a civilization that could
846140	850000	have been lost in the cataclysm.
850000	854080	It lies off the most southerly Japanese island of Yonaguni.
854080	857560	It's a large rock formation sticking up just below sea level.
857560	859360	But is it man-made?
859360	864280	Hancock isn't an expert, he's a journalist, so for his documentary he consulted three
864280	870360	real experts, Egyptologist John Anthony West, geologist Dr Robert Schoch, and geologist
870360	872680	Professor Masaaki Kimura.
872680	877200	And when you watch the program it appears the experts agree with Hancock that Yonaguni
877200	883760	is largely man-made and built more than 9,000 years ago, thus supporting the idea of a lost
883760	884760	civilization.
885160	889480	Twelve years ago I was asked by New Scientist to do a story on Yonaguni, and I mentioned
889480	891640	Hancock's film in my piece.
891640	896660	When my story was published, Hancock complained to New Scientist that it unfairly cast doubt
896660	899600	on the conclusion of his documentary.
899600	904040	But as with the videos I make on this channel, I wasn't expressing my own opinion in the
904040	908320	New Scientist's story, I simply consulted two experts.
908320	914080	Two of the same experts that Hancock had used in his film, Robert Schoch and Masaaki Kimura.
914080	917560	And I reported what they said based on their research.
917560	921440	Kimura told me he thought it was a natural rock formation that had been worked on by
921440	927520	humans when it rose above sea level due to tectonic uplift, between five and two thousand
927520	932360	years ago, and he sent me a review of his book giving an age of just over two thousand
932360	934960	years based on carbon dating.
934960	939400	Schoch thought the structure was entirely natural, and that the steps and holes were
939400	941340	erosion features.
941340	945780	And although I didn't interview or quote John Anthony West, he had already written about
945780	952320	the structure soon after visiting it, and also concluded that it was entirely natural.
952320	955100	So this was quite an editing feat.
955100	958680	Hancock consulted three experts about the Yonaguni monument.
958680	962700	One of them thought it was most likely worked on by humans a little over two thousand years
962700	967200	ago, and two of them thought the structure was entirely natural.
967200	971020	Yet none of this expert opinion was conveyed to the viewer.
971020	976060	Instead we're led exclusively to Hancock's conclusion that Yonaguni was probably carved
976060	979820	twelve thousand years ago by a lost civilisation.
979820	987100	Its presence here suggests a very sophisticated civilisation at an impossibly early date.
987100	991300	Unfortunately I can't show you with images and sound alone how some of the cuts were
991300	994880	made, but I'm sure you can spot these for yourselves.
994880	998980	Remember you're not just listening for what's being said, you're looking to see what might
998980	1000660	have been cut.
1000660	1005220	It's not that Channel 4 is worried about viewers getting free access to its programmes.
1005220	1009780	As I said, Quest for the Lost Civilisation is freely available on YouTube, apparently
1009780	1013180	with Channel 4's and Hancock's blessing.
1013180	1017380	It's just that no one is allowed to use clips to critique the programme.
1017380	1022620	As I learned from my experience with the New Scientist story, Hancock is very touchy about
1022620	1026300	any criticism of his lost civilisation fantasy.
1026300	1031780	If we dare show how he ignored expert opinion to sell his programme, heavens, people might
1031780	1035060	start thinking there is no lost civilisation.
1035060	1038100	And what would happen to all those books?
1038100	1042620	If I ask people whether they trust what they see on television, I usually get a resounding
