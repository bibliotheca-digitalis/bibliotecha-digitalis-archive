1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:14,520
I was going to do something on quotes as part of my series on science and the media, and

2
00:00:14,520 --> 00:00:19,600
I was particularly keen on showing a few tricks of the trade by which people can be misquoted.

3
00:00:19,600 --> 00:00:23,200
I wasn't quite sure how much you all knew about this already.

4
00:00:23,200 --> 00:00:27,940
But then two almost identical claims dropped into my message box, which made it clear that

5
00:00:27,940 --> 00:00:32,900
maybe these techniques aren't well understood, because the people who messaged me swore that

6
00:00:32,900 --> 00:00:39,080
Ben Santa, lead author of a chapter in an IPCC report in 1995, had admitted to deleting

7
00:00:39,080 --> 00:00:44,880
a crucial part of the report that said humans were not responsible for recent climate change.

8
00:00:44,880 --> 00:00:50,460
The admission came, they told me, in an interview on the Jesse Ventura conspiracy show.

9
00:00:50,460 --> 00:00:55,100
But it's funny because after they gave me the link, I watched exactly the same interview

10
00:00:55,100 --> 00:00:57,220
and saw no such admission.

11
00:00:57,900 --> 00:01:01,460
Lord Monckton points to deletions from the chapter.

12
00:01:01,460 --> 00:01:03,540
And there were deletions from the chapter.

13
00:01:03,540 --> 00:01:07,900
To be consistent with the other chapters, we dropped the summary at the end.

14
00:01:07,900 --> 00:01:12,280
Now how can we all watch the same thing and come away with a completely different understanding

15
00:01:12,280 --> 00:01:14,020
of what was said?

16
00:01:14,020 --> 00:01:16,700
Well welcome to the wonderful world of television.

17
00:01:16,700 --> 00:01:22,580
After ten years of experiment, television, first shown to the public at the World's Fair,

18
00:01:22,580 --> 00:01:26,980
now takes its place as a new American art and industry.

19
00:01:26,980 --> 00:01:31,540
I guess I saw things differently because I've conducted scores of interviews for television,

20
00:01:31,540 --> 00:01:35,760
so when I watch an interview now, I'm not just listening to what's said, I'm looking

21
00:01:35,760 --> 00:01:39,580
to see where the cuts are made and where the cameras are positioned.

22
00:01:39,580 --> 00:01:42,580
And it's these insights I want to share with you.

23
00:01:42,580 --> 00:01:47,140
But television is just one journalistic medium, so let's start with the medium I started in,

24
00:01:47,140 --> 00:01:48,840
which is print.

25
00:01:48,840 --> 00:01:53,560
And let's take this 60 Minutes interview with WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange as an example

26
00:01:53,560 --> 00:01:54,740
of a typical interview.

27
00:01:54,740 --> 00:02:00,100
There is a special set of rules in the United States for disclosing classified information.

28
00:02:00,100 --> 00:02:01,100
There is.

29
00:02:01,100 --> 00:02:02,100
Long standing.

30
00:02:02,100 --> 00:02:11,600
There is a special set of rules for soldiers, for members of the State Department who are

31
00:02:11,600 --> 00:02:12,600
disclosing classified information.

32
00:02:12,600 --> 00:02:18,300
There is not a special set of rules for publishers who disclose classified information.

33
00:02:18,300 --> 00:02:22,740
Clearly Assange is saying that there is no special set of rules for publishers disclosing

34
00:02:22,740 --> 00:02:27,780
classified information, which is the argument he uses to claim that publishing leaked material

35
00:02:27,780 --> 00:02:29,940
is perfectly legal.

36
00:02:29,940 --> 00:02:35,140
Now this is how the verbatim quote actually looks, but if I was writing a story for print,

37
00:02:35,140 --> 00:02:39,340
this would be too long and too cumbersome to put directly into a story.

38
00:02:39,340 --> 00:02:44,100
So I'd cut it down to Assange's basic point and quote him like this.

39
00:02:44,100 --> 00:02:48,940
The ellipse shows that I've cut some words, and the parenthesis shows that I've substituted

40
00:02:48,940 --> 00:02:52,760
a shorter word, again without changing the meaning.

41
00:02:52,760 --> 00:02:57,440
If Assange saw this edited quote, he'd probably agree that it's in perfect accord with his

42
00:02:57,440 --> 00:02:59,540
intent and meaning.

43
00:02:59,540 --> 00:03:03,980
But if I was a less honest journalist working for a newspaper intent on pushing a political

44
00:03:03,980 --> 00:03:09,440
line, I could quite easily make a cut that changes Assange's meaning completely.

45
00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:13,560
And if I wanted to erase all trace of the edit I made, I wouldn't bother putting in

46
00:03:13,560 --> 00:03:14,980
the ellipse.

47
00:03:14,980 --> 00:03:19,580
This is what people would read in my newspaper, and they'd assume it's exactly what Assange

48
00:03:19,580 --> 00:03:20,820
said.

49
00:03:20,820 --> 00:03:25,420
So without knowing what the interviewee actually said, how can you spot the difference between

50
00:03:25,420 --> 00:03:30,340
editing that's done to save space, while retaining the meaning, and dishonest editing that's

51
00:03:30,340 --> 00:03:32,140
done to manipulate the meaning?

52
00:03:32,140 --> 00:03:36,220
Well, there are lots of ways to tell from the wording, something I won't have time to

53
00:03:36,220 --> 00:03:37,700
go into here.

54
00:03:37,700 --> 00:03:41,600
But your suspicions should be aroused when an interviewee suddenly says something that

55
00:03:41,600 --> 00:03:45,360
completely contradicts everything he said before.

56
00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:50,240
For Assange to declare that publishing classified material is illegal, when for months he's

57
00:03:50,240 --> 00:03:53,800
been insisting it's legal, would be extraordinary.

58
00:03:53,800 --> 00:03:57,840
And only a journalist with a brain the size of a donut would let an admission like that

59
00:03:57,840 --> 00:04:01,440
slip by without pushing for more details.

60
00:04:01,440 --> 00:04:05,840
If Assange was doing this interview for radio, then a different technique is used.

61
00:04:05,840 --> 00:04:08,480
Obviously, ellipses don't work here.

62
00:04:08,480 --> 00:04:13,640
A long quote can simply be pieced together from bits of sentences throughout the interview.

63
00:04:13,640 --> 00:04:17,640
That's fine if it's done for time purposes and retains the meaning.

64
00:04:17,640 --> 00:04:20,880
But in unscrupulous hands, often it's not.

65
00:04:20,880 --> 00:04:25,760
Let's start with what Assange actually said, this time using sound editing software.

66
00:04:25,760 --> 00:04:34,760
There's a special set of rules for soldiers, for members of the State Department who are

67
00:04:34,760 --> 00:04:35,880
disclosing classified information.

68
00:04:35,880 --> 00:04:41,320
There's not a special set of rules for publishers who disclose classified information.

69
00:04:41,320 --> 00:04:47,480
Now with a bit of judicious editing, here's what we can make him say.

70
00:04:47,480 --> 00:04:53,860
There's a special set of rules for publishers who disclose classified information.

71
00:04:53,860 --> 00:04:58,760
The same sort of thing can be done with TV, but with television there's a problem.

72
00:04:58,760 --> 00:05:03,520
If I simply take one part of Assange's quote and paste it together with another part, the

73
00:05:03,520 --> 00:05:07,440
sound might be seamless, but there would be an obvious jump in the picture.

74
00:05:07,440 --> 00:05:13,840
There's a special set of rules for publishers who disclose classified information.

75
00:05:13,840 --> 00:05:18,220
Now some TV networks are okay with this, and it's an honest admission that something has

76
00:05:18,220 --> 00:05:21,380
been cut, just like the newspaper ellipse.

77
00:05:21,380 --> 00:05:25,760
But if a lot of edits have to be made, as so often happens, just to get a continuous

78
00:05:25,760 --> 00:05:30,960
sentence, and since television likes to cast an illusion that hates this kind of interruption,

79
00:05:30,960 --> 00:05:34,140
TV journalists have a trick to get around it.

80
00:05:34,140 --> 00:05:39,160
Now watch my dishonest edit again, this time the way it would be presented on a TV show.

81
00:05:39,160 --> 00:05:45,680
There's a special set of rules for publishers who disclose classified information.

82
00:05:45,680 --> 00:05:50,220
To the casual viewer it looks as though Assange has continued talking without a break.

83
00:05:50,220 --> 00:05:54,080
This is called a cutaway, or specifically a reverse.

84
00:05:54,080 --> 00:05:59,200
A cutaway could be anything, from Assange walking in the garden to a shot of a WikiLeaks

85
00:05:59,200 --> 00:06:00,280
page.

86
00:06:00,280 --> 00:06:04,760
But the most common type of cutaway is the reverse, or what Australian TV journalists

87
00:06:04,760 --> 00:06:10,160
call noddies, because they're quick and easy, and make the cut less obvious.

88
00:06:10,160 --> 00:06:14,760
You can go to the cutaway, do the audio edit, and then come back to the interviewee, and

89
00:06:14,760 --> 00:06:17,040
it sounds as though nothing has been skipped.

90
00:06:17,040 --> 00:06:22,960
There's a special set of rules for publishers who disclose classified information.

91
00:06:22,960 --> 00:06:27,060
But in half a second, we've changed Assange's meaning completely.

92
00:06:27,060 --> 00:06:33,540
These reverses happen so often in TV interviews, a passive viewer would hardly notice them.

93
00:06:33,540 --> 00:06:37,580
How many cuts can you see in this short clip from the 60 Minutes interview?

94
00:06:37,580 --> 00:06:39,260
What statements are you referring to?

95
00:06:39,260 --> 00:06:47,260
The statements by the Vice President, Biden, saying, for instance, that I was a high-tech

96
00:06:47,260 --> 00:06:48,660
terrorist.

97
00:06:48,660 --> 00:06:53,100
Sarah Palin calling to our organisation to be dealt with like the Taliban and be hunted

98
00:06:53,100 --> 00:06:54,100
down.

99
00:06:54,100 --> 00:06:59,540
These are rules either for my assassination or the assassination of my staff, or for us

100
00:06:59,540 --> 00:07:04,620
to be kidnapped and renditioned back to the United States to be executed.

101
00:07:04,620 --> 00:07:08,620
If you said three, congratulations, you'd be wrong.

102
00:07:08,620 --> 00:07:10,140
There were actually six.

103
00:07:10,140 --> 00:07:13,100
Okay, three of them were in the cutaways.

104
00:07:13,100 --> 00:07:17,180
The editor isn't cutting to Steve Croft here, because he's reacting to something Assange

105
00:07:17,180 --> 00:07:21,660
said, or because he's interjecting, or because he's got such a pretty face, we just can't

106
00:07:21,660 --> 00:07:22,900
get enough of it.

107
00:07:22,900 --> 00:07:25,080
This is an edit of the audio.

108
00:07:25,080 --> 00:07:27,900
But let me explain the other three.

109
00:07:27,900 --> 00:07:32,260
Cameras and camera crews are expensive, much more so in the past when networks used to

110
00:07:32,260 --> 00:07:36,540
cut costs by having just one camera, focused on the interviewee.

111
00:07:36,540 --> 00:07:39,420
The interviewer would be filmed when the interview was over.

112
00:07:39,420 --> 00:07:43,700
It meant he had to sit in front of the camera, staring at nothing and looking interested,

113
00:07:43,700 --> 00:07:47,780
even repeating the same questions that were put during the interview, in order to get

114
00:07:47,780 --> 00:07:49,460
some cutaways.

115
00:07:49,460 --> 00:07:53,860
So these days it's common to have two cameras, and with the Assange interview, a third camera

116
00:07:53,860 --> 00:07:58,900
was taking a wide shot, allowing more variety in the way the cuts are made.

117
00:07:58,900 --> 00:08:03,740
Here we go from a close-up to a wide shot, and that's where something's been cut.

118
00:08:03,740 --> 00:08:07,060
When we go back to the close-up, that's another edit.

119
00:08:07,060 --> 00:08:10,860
This one is so obvious it can even be heard in the audio alone.

120
00:08:10,860 --> 00:08:16,500
Or for us to be kidnapped and renditioned back to the United States to be executed.

121
00:08:16,540 --> 00:08:20,860
One reason for that is that an audio recording isn't consistent throughout an interview.

122
00:08:20,860 --> 00:08:25,100
The tone of an interviewee's voice will change, and even the quality of the recording will

123
00:08:25,100 --> 00:08:29,380
change as he shifts his head slightly in relation to the microphone.

124
00:08:29,380 --> 00:08:33,860
Or his words might be so close together that even a precise edit will push one word too

125
00:08:33,860 --> 00:08:36,140
close to the edit point.

126
00:08:36,140 --> 00:08:40,100
That's obviously the case with the sixth edit, where the camera cuts to Assange at the end

127
00:08:40,100 --> 00:08:44,620
of Steve Croft's question, leaving out the first part of his opening line.

128
00:08:45,060 --> 00:08:52,060
So how would an unscrupulous journalist get around the problem of one word butting right

129
00:08:52,060 --> 00:08:54,020
up against another?

130
00:08:54,020 --> 00:08:58,540
Let's use another 60 Minutes interview, this time with a faster-talking Mark Zuckerberg,

131
00:08:58,540 --> 00:09:00,780
to see how this could be done.

132
00:09:00,780 --> 00:09:04,860
By the way, the cutaway here to Lesley Stahl isn't done to cut anything Zuckerberg said

133
00:09:04,860 --> 00:09:06,740
– it's a reaction shot.

134
00:09:06,740 --> 00:09:12,020
Without it, you'd just hear Stahl's reaction off-camera, which would sound a little weird.

135
00:09:12,020 --> 00:09:15,660
Now what I'll show you in the text are the words I want to extract from the Zuckerberg

136
00:09:15,660 --> 00:09:18,260
interview for my fabricated quote.

137
00:09:32,260 --> 00:09:36,500
So here's the clip I want to end up with, deleting a large chunk of what Zuckerberg

138
00:09:36,500 --> 00:09:38,100
said in between.

139
00:09:38,100 --> 00:09:41,540
Now if we go to the audio and make the cut I want, you can see the problem.

140
00:09:41,580 --> 00:09:46,940
However precisely I make the cut, one word will always butt up against another.

141
00:09:46,940 --> 00:09:49,940
Even with the benefit of a cutaway, you can clearly hear the edit.

142
00:09:49,940 --> 00:09:53,540
It's funny, I mean, when I was getting started, you know, with my roommates building stuff

143
00:09:53,540 --> 00:09:55,100
because we thought it was cool.

144
00:09:55,100 --> 00:09:59,580
Most ethical networks would just let that go, just as 60 Minutes did with Assange's

145
00:09:59,580 --> 00:10:03,820
obvious edits, because the only way to get around it is to do something that has to be

146
00:10:03,820 --> 00:10:06,060
regarded as deliberately deceptive.

147
00:10:06,060 --> 00:10:10,420
Let's go to the Zuckerberg audio track again to see how it's done.

148
00:10:10,500 --> 00:10:14,660
Since the problem is that the words come too close together, I could of course just separate

149
00:10:14,660 --> 00:10:18,300
them with a fraction of a second's silence, a simple pause.

150
00:10:18,300 --> 00:10:21,660
It's funny, I mean, when I was getting started, you know, with my roommates building stuff

151
00:10:21,660 --> 00:10:23,780
because we thought it was cool, I do...

152
00:10:23,780 --> 00:10:27,340
But this sounds artificial and makes the cut even more obvious.

153
00:10:27,340 --> 00:10:29,140
So here's the trick.

154
00:10:29,140 --> 00:10:33,860
Instead of silence, we copy a pause for breath from another part of the interview and simply

155
00:10:33,860 --> 00:10:36,780
insert it where we made the edit.

156
00:10:36,780 --> 00:10:39,140
Now listen to how natural that sounds.

157
00:10:39,140 --> 00:10:42,660
It's funny, I mean, when I was getting started, you know, with my roommates building stuff

158
00:10:42,660 --> 00:10:45,980
because we thought it was cool, I do remember having...

159
00:10:45,980 --> 00:10:51,100
And when we mask the audio with a cutaway, the cut is imperceptible to the casual viewer.

160
00:10:51,100 --> 00:10:54,620
It's funny, I mean, when I was getting started, you know, with my roommates building stuff

161
00:10:54,620 --> 00:10:56,180
because we thought it was cool...

162
00:10:56,180 --> 00:11:00,700
Editing interviews and using cutaways is something every television journalist does.

163
00:11:00,700 --> 00:11:05,580
But every cut we make has to be weighed carefully to ensure it's done for time reasons alone

164
00:11:05,580 --> 00:11:09,260
and doesn't change an interviewee's intent or meaning.

165
00:11:09,260 --> 00:11:12,340
Which brings us back to Jesse Ventura's conspiracy program.

166
00:11:12,340 --> 00:11:16,860
Jesse Ventura and his team are hot on the trail of a conspiracy to use the issue of

167
00:11:16,860 --> 00:11:19,940
global warming to control your life.

168
00:11:19,940 --> 00:11:23,620
Look again at that Santa interview with a more practised eye.

169
00:11:23,620 --> 00:11:28,180
Lord Moncton points to deletions from the chapter and there were deletions from the

170
00:11:28,180 --> 00:11:29,260
chapter.

171
00:11:29,260 --> 00:11:33,180
To be consistent with the other chapters, we dropped the summary at the end.

172
00:11:33,180 --> 00:11:35,040
Do you see it now?

173
00:11:35,040 --> 00:11:40,600
That's right, the explanation Santa gave about the deletions was, ironically, itself

174
00:11:40,600 --> 00:11:41,600
deleted.

175
00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:46,560
Instead, the program goes to a cutaway and another part of Santa's interview is inserted

176
00:11:46,560 --> 00:11:48,180
in its place.

177
00:11:48,180 --> 00:11:52,120
If we listen to the first part of the clip before the edit, it sounds as though Santa's

178
00:11:52,120 --> 00:11:54,920
about to explain what the deletions were.

179
00:11:54,920 --> 00:11:59,520
Lord Moncton points to deletions from the chapter and there were deletions from the

180
00:11:59,520 --> 00:12:01,520
chapter.

181
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:04,000
But...

182
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:05,000
And...

183
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:06,400
What?

184
00:12:06,400 --> 00:12:08,440
We already know there were deletions.

185
00:12:08,440 --> 00:12:12,060
Santa said fifteen years ago that changes were made to the chapter.

186
00:12:12,060 --> 00:12:15,840
The controversy is about what those deletions were.

187
00:12:15,840 --> 00:12:19,720
But for some reason we don't get to hear the rest of Santa's sentence.

188
00:12:19,720 --> 00:12:22,720
It's um... deleted.

189
00:12:22,720 --> 00:12:26,880
Now maybe Santa didn't go on to explain what the deletions were.

190
00:12:26,880 --> 00:12:30,520
But if that's the case, then why didn't the interviewer ask him?

191
00:12:30,520 --> 00:12:32,840
After all, that's the whole point of the interview.

192
00:12:32,840 --> 00:12:37,360
It's the one thing the show and its audience want to know.

193
00:12:37,360 --> 00:12:41,600
The result of this clever editing is that a lot of bloggers, completely oblivious to

194
00:12:41,600 --> 00:12:48,240
the cutaway, are quoting Santa as if this is what he actually said.

195
00:12:48,240 --> 00:12:52,920
And even adding things they thought he said.

196
00:12:52,920 --> 00:12:55,040
That's the power of television.

197
00:12:55,040 --> 00:13:00,080
Producers know what their target audience wants to hear and the film can be edited accordingly.

198
00:13:00,080 --> 00:13:04,940
If you want to make a TV series called Quest for Lost Civilizations, for example, then

199
00:13:04,940 --> 00:13:08,880
you really have to give your audience lost civilizations.

200
00:13:08,880 --> 00:13:13,240
Now this is the point in my original video where I took a look at the TV series Quest

201
00:13:13,240 --> 00:13:16,880
for the Lost Civilization by Graham Hancock.

202
00:13:16,880 --> 00:13:20,920
It was shown on Channel 4, which seems to believe that any old nonsense should be shown

203
00:13:20,920 --> 00:13:25,880
on TV, as long as it stirs up controversy and gets ratings.

204
00:13:25,880 --> 00:13:30,560
And one of the best ways to do this is to take a counter-cultural view and sell it like

205
00:13:30,560 --> 00:13:32,240
a soap product.

206
00:13:32,240 --> 00:13:36,800
But when I want to show how this has been done, I'm not allowed to do that because the

207
00:13:36,800 --> 00:13:39,320
film is copyright.

208
00:13:39,320 --> 00:13:43,680
That's why you can't see my original video in the UK and Ireland.

209
00:13:43,680 --> 00:13:47,840
But here's a brief summary using just still pictures and a bit of audio.

210
00:13:47,840 --> 00:13:52,360
Hancock's belief is that 12,000 years ago there was an advanced civilization stretching

211
00:13:52,360 --> 00:13:57,320
right around the world, and that it was submerged after the last ice age.

212
00:13:57,320 --> 00:14:01,080
One of the places he thinks he's found this is off the island of Yonaguni in the western

213
00:14:01,080 --> 00:14:02,080
Pacific.

214
00:14:02,080 --> 00:14:06,140
On the other side of the Pacific Ocean there's exciting evidence of a civilization that could

215
00:14:06,140 --> 00:14:10,000
have been lost in the cataclysm.

216
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:14,080
It lies off the most southerly Japanese island of Yonaguni.

217
00:14:14,080 --> 00:14:17,560
It's a large rock formation sticking up just below sea level.

218
00:14:17,560 --> 00:14:19,360
But is it man-made?

219
00:14:19,360 --> 00:14:24,280
Hancock isn't an expert, he's a journalist, so for his documentary he consulted three

220
00:14:24,280 --> 00:14:30,360
real experts, Egyptologist John Anthony West, geologist Dr Robert Schoch, and geologist

221
00:14:30,360 --> 00:14:32,680
Professor Masaaki Kimura.

222
00:14:32,680 --> 00:14:37,200
And when you watch the program it appears the experts agree with Hancock that Yonaguni

223
00:14:37,200 --> 00:14:43,760
is largely man-made and built more than 9,000 years ago, thus supporting the idea of a lost

224
00:14:43,760 --> 00:14:44,760
civilization.

225
00:14:45,160 --> 00:14:49,480
Twelve years ago I was asked by New Scientist to do a story on Yonaguni, and I mentioned

226
00:14:49,480 --> 00:14:51,640
Hancock's film in my piece.

227
00:14:51,640 --> 00:14:56,660
When my story was published, Hancock complained to New Scientist that it unfairly cast doubt

228
00:14:56,660 --> 00:14:59,600
on the conclusion of his documentary.

229
00:14:59,600 --> 00:15:04,040
But as with the videos I make on this channel, I wasn't expressing my own opinion in the

230
00:15:04,040 --> 00:15:08,320
New Scientist's story, I simply consulted two experts.

231
00:15:08,320 --> 00:15:14,080
Two of the same experts that Hancock had used in his film, Robert Schoch and Masaaki Kimura.

232
00:15:14,080 --> 00:15:17,560
And I reported what they said based on their research.

233
00:15:17,560 --> 00:15:21,440
Kimura told me he thought it was a natural rock formation that had been worked on by

234
00:15:21,440 --> 00:15:27,520
humans when it rose above sea level due to tectonic uplift, between five and two thousand

235
00:15:27,520 --> 00:15:32,360
years ago, and he sent me a review of his book giving an age of just over two thousand

236
00:15:32,360 --> 00:15:34,960
years based on carbon dating.

237
00:15:34,960 --> 00:15:39,400
Schoch thought the structure was entirely natural, and that the steps and holes were

238
00:15:39,400 --> 00:15:41,340
erosion features.

239
00:15:41,340 --> 00:15:45,780
And although I didn't interview or quote John Anthony West, he had already written about

240
00:15:45,780 --> 00:15:52,320
the structure soon after visiting it, and also concluded that it was entirely natural.

241
00:15:52,320 --> 00:15:55,100
So this was quite an editing feat.

242
00:15:55,100 --> 00:15:58,680
Hancock consulted three experts about the Yonaguni monument.

243
00:15:58,680 --> 00:16:02,700
One of them thought it was most likely worked on by humans a little over two thousand years

244
00:16:02,700 --> 00:16:07,200
ago, and two of them thought the structure was entirely natural.

245
00:16:07,200 --> 00:16:11,020
Yet none of this expert opinion was conveyed to the viewer.

246
00:16:11,020 --> 00:16:16,060
Instead we're led exclusively to Hancock's conclusion that Yonaguni was probably carved

247
00:16:16,060 --> 00:16:19,820
twelve thousand years ago by a lost civilisation.

248
00:16:19,820 --> 00:16:27,100
Its presence here suggests a very sophisticated civilisation at an impossibly early date.

249
00:16:27,100 --> 00:16:31,300
Unfortunately I can't show you with images and sound alone how some of the cuts were

250
00:16:31,300 --> 00:16:34,880
made, but I'm sure you can spot these for yourselves.

251
00:16:34,880 --> 00:16:38,980
Remember you're not just listening for what's being said, you're looking to see what might

252
00:16:38,980 --> 00:16:40,660
have been cut.

253
00:16:40,660 --> 00:16:45,220
It's not that Channel 4 is worried about viewers getting free access to its programmes.

254
00:16:45,220 --> 00:16:49,780
As I said, Quest for the Lost Civilisation is freely available on YouTube, apparently

255
00:16:49,780 --> 00:16:53,180
with Channel 4's and Hancock's blessing.

256
00:16:53,180 --> 00:16:57,380
It's just that no one is allowed to use clips to critique the programme.

257
00:16:57,380 --> 00:17:02,620
As I learned from my experience with the New Scientist story, Hancock is very touchy about

258
00:17:02,620 --> 00:17:06,300
any criticism of his lost civilisation fantasy.

259
00:17:06,300 --> 00:17:11,780
If we dare show how he ignored expert opinion to sell his programme, heavens, people might

260
00:17:11,780 --> 00:17:15,060
start thinking there is no lost civilisation.

261
00:17:15,060 --> 00:17:18,100
And what would happen to all those books?

262
00:17:18,100 --> 00:17:22,620
If I ask people whether they trust what they see on television, I usually get a resounding

263
00:17:22,620 --> 00:17:24,080
no.

264
00:17:24,080 --> 00:17:28,700
Everyone seems to know that most television programmes are in the business of entertainment.

265
00:17:28,700 --> 00:17:32,900
Everyone knows TV producers can make you think you've seen something that never happened,

266
00:17:32,900 --> 00:17:35,180
or heard something that wasn't said.

267
00:17:35,180 --> 00:17:39,260
Yes, we all know it, but boy, we still fall for it.
