00:00.000 --> 00:14.520
I was going to do something on quotes as part of my series on science and the media, and

00:14.520 --> 00:19.600
I was particularly keen on showing a few tricks of the trade by which people can be misquoted.

00:19.600 --> 00:23.200
I wasn't quite sure how much you all knew about this already.

00:23.200 --> 00:27.940
But then two almost identical claims dropped into my message box, which made it clear that

00:27.940 --> 00:32.900
maybe these techniques aren't well understood, because the people who messaged me swore that

00:32.900 --> 00:39.080
Ben Santa, lead author of a chapter in an IPCC report in 1995, had admitted to deleting

00:39.080 --> 00:44.880
a crucial part of the report that said humans were not responsible for recent climate change.

00:44.880 --> 00:50.460
The admission came, they told me, in an interview on the Jesse Ventura conspiracy show.

00:50.460 --> 00:55.100
But it's funny because after they gave me the link, I watched exactly the same interview

00:55.100 --> 00:57.220
and saw no such admission.

00:57.900 --> 01:01.460
Lord Monckton points to deletions from the chapter.

01:01.460 --> 01:03.540
And there were deletions from the chapter.

01:03.540 --> 01:07.900
To be consistent with the other chapters, we dropped the summary at the end.

01:07.900 --> 01:12.280
Now how can we all watch the same thing and come away with a completely different understanding

01:12.280 --> 01:14.020
of what was said?

01:14.020 --> 01:16.700
Well welcome to the wonderful world of television.

01:16.700 --> 01:22.580
After ten years of experiment, television, first shown to the public at the World's Fair,

01:22.580 --> 01:26.980
now takes its place as a new American art and industry.

01:26.980 --> 01:31.540
I guess I saw things differently because I've conducted scores of interviews for television,

01:31.540 --> 01:35.760
so when I watch an interview now, I'm not just listening to what's said, I'm looking

01:35.760 --> 01:39.580
to see where the cuts are made and where the cameras are positioned.

01:39.580 --> 01:42.580
And it's these insights I want to share with you.

01:42.580 --> 01:47.140
But television is just one journalistic medium, so let's start with the medium I started in,

01:47.140 --> 01:48.840
which is print.

01:48.840 --> 01:53.560
And let's take this 60 Minutes interview with WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange as an example

01:53.560 --> 01:54.740
of a typical interview.

01:54.740 --> 02:00.100
There is a special set of rules in the United States for disclosing classified information.

02:00.100 --> 02:01.100
There is.

02:01.100 --> 02:02.100
Long standing.

02:02.100 --> 02:11.600
There is a special set of rules for soldiers, for members of the State Department who are

02:11.600 --> 02:12.600
disclosing classified information.

02:12.600 --> 02:18.300
There is not a special set of rules for publishers who disclose classified information.

02:18.300 --> 02:22.740
Clearly Assange is saying that there is no special set of rules for publishers disclosing

02:22.740 --> 02:27.780
classified information, which is the argument he uses to claim that publishing leaked material

02:27.780 --> 02:29.940
is perfectly legal.

02:29.940 --> 02:35.140
Now this is how the verbatim quote actually looks, but if I was writing a story for print,

02:35.140 --> 02:39.340
this would be too long and too cumbersome to put directly into a story.

02:39.340 --> 02:44.100
So I'd cut it down to Assange's basic point and quote him like this.

02:44.100 --> 02:48.940
The ellipse shows that I've cut some words, and the parenthesis shows that I've substituted

02:48.940 --> 02:52.760
a shorter word, again without changing the meaning.

02:52.760 --> 02:57.440
If Assange saw this edited quote, he'd probably agree that it's in perfect accord with his

02:57.440 --> 02:59.540
intent and meaning.

02:59.540 --> 03:03.980
But if I was a less honest journalist working for a newspaper intent on pushing a political

03:03.980 --> 03:09.440
line, I could quite easily make a cut that changes Assange's meaning completely.

03:09.440 --> 03:13.560
And if I wanted to erase all trace of the edit I made, I wouldn't bother putting in

03:13.560 --> 03:14.980
the ellipse.

03:14.980 --> 03:19.580
This is what people would read in my newspaper, and they'd assume it's exactly what Assange

03:19.580 --> 03:20.820
said.

03:20.820 --> 03:25.420
So without knowing what the interviewee actually said, how can you spot the difference between

03:25.420 --> 03:30.340
editing that's done to save space, while retaining the meaning, and dishonest editing that's

03:30.340 --> 03:32.140
done to manipulate the meaning?

03:32.140 --> 03:36.220
Well, there are lots of ways to tell from the wording, something I won't have time to

03:36.220 --> 03:37.700
go into here.

03:37.700 --> 03:41.600
But your suspicions should be aroused when an interviewee suddenly says something that

03:41.600 --> 03:45.360
completely contradicts everything he said before.

03:45.360 --> 03:50.240
For Assange to declare that publishing classified material is illegal, when for months he's

03:50.240 --> 03:53.800
been insisting it's legal, would be extraordinary.

03:53.800 --> 03:57.840
And only a journalist with a brain the size of a donut would let an admission like that

03:57.840 --> 04:01.440
slip by without pushing for more details.

04:01.440 --> 04:05.840
If Assange was doing this interview for radio, then a different technique is used.

04:05.840 --> 04:08.480
Obviously, ellipses don't work here.

04:08.480 --> 04:13.640
A long quote can simply be pieced together from bits of sentences throughout the interview.

04:13.640 --> 04:17.640
That's fine if it's done for time purposes and retains the meaning.

04:17.640 --> 04:20.880
But in unscrupulous hands, often it's not.

04:20.880 --> 04:25.760
Let's start with what Assange actually said, this time using sound editing software.

04:25.760 --> 04:34.760
There's a special set of rules for soldiers, for members of the State Department who are

04:34.760 --> 04:35.880
disclosing classified information.

04:35.880 --> 04:41.320
There's not a special set of rules for publishers who disclose classified information.

04:41.320 --> 04:47.480
Now with a bit of judicious editing, here's what we can make him say.

04:47.480 --> 04:53.860
There's a special set of rules for publishers who disclose classified information.

04:53.860 --> 04:58.760
The same sort of thing can be done with TV, but with television there's a problem.

04:58.760 --> 05:03.520
If I simply take one part of Assange's quote and paste it together with another part, the

05:03.520 --> 05:07.440
sound might be seamless, but there would be an obvious jump in the picture.

05:07.440 --> 05:13.840
There's a special set of rules for publishers who disclose classified information.

05:13.840 --> 05:18.220
Now some TV networks are okay with this, and it's an honest admission that something has

05:18.220 --> 05:21.380
been cut, just like the newspaper ellipse.

05:21.380 --> 05:25.760
But if a lot of edits have to be made, as so often happens, just to get a continuous

05:25.760 --> 05:30.960
sentence, and since television likes to cast an illusion that hates this kind of interruption,

05:30.960 --> 05:34.140
TV journalists have a trick to get around it.

05:34.140 --> 05:39.160
Now watch my dishonest edit again, this time the way it would be presented on a TV show.

05:39.160 --> 05:45.680
There's a special set of rules for publishers who disclose classified information.

05:45.680 --> 05:50.220
To the casual viewer it looks as though Assange has continued talking without a break.

05:50.220 --> 05:54.080
This is called a cutaway, or specifically a reverse.

05:54.080 --> 05:59.200
A cutaway could be anything, from Assange walking in the garden to a shot of a WikiLeaks

05:59.200 --> 06:00.280
page.

06:00.280 --> 06:04.760
But the most common type of cutaway is the reverse, or what Australian TV journalists

06:04.760 --> 06:10.160
call noddies, because they're quick and easy, and make the cut less obvious.

06:10.160 --> 06:14.760
You can go to the cutaway, do the audio edit, and then come back to the interviewee, and

06:14.760 --> 06:17.040
it sounds as though nothing has been skipped.

06:17.040 --> 06:22.960
There's a special set of rules for publishers who disclose classified information.

06:22.960 --> 06:27.060
But in half a second, we've changed Assange's meaning completely.

06:27.060 --> 06:33.540
These reverses happen so often in TV interviews, a passive viewer would hardly notice them.

06:33.540 --> 06:37.580
How many cuts can you see in this short clip from the 60 Minutes interview?

06:37.580 --> 06:39.260
What statements are you referring to?

06:39.260 --> 06:47.260
The statements by the Vice President, Biden, saying, for instance, that I was a high-tech

06:47.260 --> 06:48.660
terrorist.

06:48.660 --> 06:53.100
Sarah Palin calling to our organisation to be dealt with like the Taliban and be hunted

06:53.100 --> 06:54.100
down.

06:54.100 --> 06:59.540
These are rules either for my assassination or the assassination of my staff, or for us

06:59.540 --> 07:04.620
to be kidnapped and renditioned back to the United States to be executed.

07:04.620 --> 07:08.620
If you said three, congratulations, you'd be wrong.

07:08.620 --> 07:10.140
There were actually six.

07:10.140 --> 07:13.100
Okay, three of them were in the cutaways.

07:13.100 --> 07:17.180
The editor isn't cutting to Steve Croft here, because he's reacting to something Assange

07:17.180 --> 07:21.660
said, or because he's interjecting, or because he's got such a pretty face, we just can't

07:21.660 --> 07:22.900
get enough of it.

07:22.900 --> 07:25.080
This is an edit of the audio.

07:25.080 --> 07:27.900
But let me explain the other three.

07:27.900 --> 07:32.260
Cameras and camera crews are expensive, much more so in the past when networks used to

07:32.260 --> 07:36.540
cut costs by having just one camera, focused on the interviewee.

07:36.540 --> 07:39.420
The interviewer would be filmed when the interview was over.

07:39.420 --> 07:43.700
It meant he had to sit in front of the camera, staring at nothing and looking interested,

07:43.700 --> 07:47.780
even repeating the same questions that were put during the interview, in order to get

07:47.780 --> 07:49.460
some cutaways.

07:49.460 --> 07:53.860
So these days it's common to have two cameras, and with the Assange interview, a third camera

07:53.860 --> 07:58.900
was taking a wide shot, allowing more variety in the way the cuts are made.

07:58.900 --> 08:03.740
Here we go from a close-up to a wide shot, and that's where something's been cut.

08:03.740 --> 08:07.060
When we go back to the close-up, that's another edit.

08:07.060 --> 08:10.860
This one is so obvious it can even be heard in the audio alone.

08:10.860 --> 08:16.500
Or for us to be kidnapped and renditioned back to the United States to be executed.

08:16.540 --> 08:20.860
One reason for that is that an audio recording isn't consistent throughout an interview.

08:20.860 --> 08:25.100
The tone of an interviewee's voice will change, and even the quality of the recording will

08:25.100 --> 08:29.380
change as he shifts his head slightly in relation to the microphone.

08:29.380 --> 08:33.860
Or his words might be so close together that even a precise edit will push one word too

08:33.860 --> 08:36.140
close to the edit point.

08:36.140 --> 08:40.100
That's obviously the case with the sixth edit, where the camera cuts to Assange at the end

08:40.100 --> 08:44.620
of Steve Croft's question, leaving out the first part of his opening line.

08:45.060 --> 08:52.060
So how would an unscrupulous journalist get around the problem of one word butting right

08:52.060 --> 08:54.020
up against another?

08:54.020 --> 08:58.540
Let's use another 60 Minutes interview, this time with a faster-talking Mark Zuckerberg,

08:58.540 --> 09:00.780
to see how this could be done.

09:00.780 --> 09:04.860
By the way, the cutaway here to Lesley Stahl isn't done to cut anything Zuckerberg said

09:04.860 --> 09:06.740
– it's a reaction shot.

09:06.740 --> 09:12.020
Without it, you'd just hear Stahl's reaction off-camera, which would sound a little weird.

09:12.020 --> 09:15.660
Now what I'll show you in the text are the words I want to extract from the Zuckerberg

09:15.660 --> 09:18.260
interview for my fabricated quote.

09:32.260 --> 09:36.500
So here's the clip I want to end up with, deleting a large chunk of what Zuckerberg

09:36.500 --> 09:38.100
said in between.

09:38.100 --> 09:41.540
Now if we go to the audio and make the cut I want, you can see the problem.

09:41.580 --> 09:46.940
However precisely I make the cut, one word will always butt up against another.

09:46.940 --> 09:49.940
Even with the benefit of a cutaway, you can clearly hear the edit.

09:49.940 --> 09:53.540
It's funny, I mean, when I was getting started, you know, with my roommates building stuff

09:53.540 --> 09:55.100
because we thought it was cool.

09:55.100 --> 09:59.580
Most ethical networks would just let that go, just as 60 Minutes did with Assange's

09:59.580 --> 10:03.820
obvious edits, because the only way to get around it is to do something that has to be

10:03.820 --> 10:06.060
regarded as deliberately deceptive.

10:06.060 --> 10:10.420
Let's go to the Zuckerberg audio track again to see how it's done.

10:10.500 --> 10:14.660
Since the problem is that the words come too close together, I could of course just separate

10:14.660 --> 10:18.300
them with a fraction of a second's silence, a simple pause.

10:18.300 --> 10:21.660
It's funny, I mean, when I was getting started, you know, with my roommates building stuff

10:21.660 --> 10:23.780
because we thought it was cool, I do...

10:23.780 --> 10:27.340
But this sounds artificial and makes the cut even more obvious.

10:27.340 --> 10:29.140
So here's the trick.

10:29.140 --> 10:33.860
Instead of silence, we copy a pause for breath from another part of the interview and simply

10:33.860 --> 10:36.780
insert it where we made the edit.

10:36.780 --> 10:39.140
Now listen to how natural that sounds.

10:39.140 --> 10:42.660
It's funny, I mean, when I was getting started, you know, with my roommates building stuff

10:42.660 --> 10:45.980
because we thought it was cool, I do remember having...

10:45.980 --> 10:51.100
And when we mask the audio with a cutaway, the cut is imperceptible to the casual viewer.

10:51.100 --> 10:54.620
It's funny, I mean, when I was getting started, you know, with my roommates building stuff

10:54.620 --> 10:56.180
because we thought it was cool...

10:56.180 --> 11:00.700
Editing interviews and using cutaways is something every television journalist does.

11:00.700 --> 11:05.580
But every cut we make has to be weighed carefully to ensure it's done for time reasons alone

11:05.580 --> 11:09.260
and doesn't change an interviewee's intent or meaning.

11:09.260 --> 11:12.340
Which brings us back to Jesse Ventura's conspiracy program.

11:12.340 --> 11:16.860
Jesse Ventura and his team are hot on the trail of a conspiracy to use the issue of

11:16.860 --> 11:19.940
global warming to control your life.

11:19.940 --> 11:23.620
Look again at that Santa interview with a more practised eye.

11:23.620 --> 11:28.180
Lord Moncton points to deletions from the chapter and there were deletions from the

11:28.180 --> 11:29.260
chapter.

11:29.260 --> 11:33.180
To be consistent with the other chapters, we dropped the summary at the end.

11:33.180 --> 11:35.040
Do you see it now?

11:35.040 --> 11:40.600
That's right, the explanation Santa gave about the deletions was, ironically, itself

11:40.600 --> 11:41.600
deleted.

11:41.600 --> 11:46.560
Instead, the program goes to a cutaway and another part of Santa's interview is inserted

11:46.560 --> 11:48.180
in its place.

11:48.180 --> 11:52.120
If we listen to the first part of the clip before the edit, it sounds as though Santa's

11:52.120 --> 11:54.920
about to explain what the deletions were.

11:54.920 --> 11:59.520
Lord Moncton points to deletions from the chapter and there were deletions from the

11:59.520 --> 12:01.520
chapter.

12:02.000 --> 12:04.000
But...

12:04.000 --> 12:05.000
And...

12:05.000 --> 12:06.400
What?

12:06.400 --> 12:08.440
We already know there were deletions.

12:08.440 --> 12:12.060
Santa said fifteen years ago that changes were made to the chapter.

12:12.060 --> 12:15.840
The controversy is about what those deletions were.

12:15.840 --> 12:19.720
But for some reason we don't get to hear the rest of Santa's sentence.

12:19.720 --> 12:22.720
It's um... deleted.

12:22.720 --> 12:26.880
Now maybe Santa didn't go on to explain what the deletions were.

12:26.880 --> 12:30.520
But if that's the case, then why didn't the interviewer ask him?

12:30.520 --> 12:32.840
After all, that's the whole point of the interview.

12:32.840 --> 12:37.360
It's the one thing the show and its audience want to know.

12:37.360 --> 12:41.600
The result of this clever editing is that a lot of bloggers, completely oblivious to

12:41.600 --> 12:48.240
the cutaway, are quoting Santa as if this is what he actually said.

12:48.240 --> 12:52.920
And even adding things they thought he said.

12:52.920 --> 12:55.040
That's the power of television.

12:55.040 --> 13:00.080
Producers know what their target audience wants to hear and the film can be edited accordingly.

13:00.080 --> 13:04.940
If you want to make a TV series called Quest for Lost Civilizations, for example, then

13:04.940 --> 13:08.880
you really have to give your audience lost civilizations.

13:08.880 --> 13:13.240
Now this is the point in my original video where I took a look at the TV series Quest

13:13.240 --> 13:16.880
for the Lost Civilization by Graham Hancock.

13:16.880 --> 13:20.920
It was shown on Channel 4, which seems to believe that any old nonsense should be shown

13:20.920 --> 13:25.880
on TV, as long as it stirs up controversy and gets ratings.

13:25.880 --> 13:30.560
And one of the best ways to do this is to take a counter-cultural view and sell it like

13:30.560 --> 13:32.240
a soap product.

13:32.240 --> 13:36.800
But when I want to show how this has been done, I'm not allowed to do that because the

13:36.800 --> 13:39.320
film is copyright.

13:39.320 --> 13:43.680
That's why you can't see my original video in the UK and Ireland.

13:43.680 --> 13:47.840
But here's a brief summary using just still pictures and a bit of audio.

13:47.840 --> 13:52.360
Hancock's belief is that 12,000 years ago there was an advanced civilization stretching

13:52.360 --> 13:57.320
right around the world, and that it was submerged after the last ice age.

13:57.320 --> 14:01.080
One of the places he thinks he's found this is off the island of Yonaguni in the western

14:01.080 --> 14:02.080
Pacific.

14:02.080 --> 14:06.140
On the other side of the Pacific Ocean there's exciting evidence of a civilization that could

14:06.140 --> 14:10.000
have been lost in the cataclysm.

14:10.000 --> 14:14.080
It lies off the most southerly Japanese island of Yonaguni.

14:14.080 --> 14:17.560
It's a large rock formation sticking up just below sea level.

14:17.560 --> 14:19.360
But is it man-made?

14:19.360 --> 14:24.280
Hancock isn't an expert, he's a journalist, so for his documentary he consulted three

14:24.280 --> 14:30.360
real experts, Egyptologist John Anthony West, geologist Dr Robert Schoch, and geologist

14:30.360 --> 14:32.680
Professor Masaaki Kimura.

14:32.680 --> 14:37.200
And when you watch the program it appears the experts agree with Hancock that Yonaguni

14:37.200 --> 14:43.760
is largely man-made and built more than 9,000 years ago, thus supporting the idea of a lost

14:43.760 --> 14:44.760
civilization.

14:45.160 --> 14:49.480
Twelve years ago I was asked by New Scientist to do a story on Yonaguni, and I mentioned

14:49.480 --> 14:51.640
Hancock's film in my piece.

14:51.640 --> 14:56.660
When my story was published, Hancock complained to New Scientist that it unfairly cast doubt

14:56.660 --> 14:59.600
on the conclusion of his documentary.

14:59.600 --> 15:04.040
But as with the videos I make on this channel, I wasn't expressing my own opinion in the

15:04.040 --> 15:08.320
New Scientist's story, I simply consulted two experts.

15:08.320 --> 15:14.080
Two of the same experts that Hancock had used in his film, Robert Schoch and Masaaki Kimura.

15:14.080 --> 15:17.560
And I reported what they said based on their research.

15:17.560 --> 15:21.440
Kimura told me he thought it was a natural rock formation that had been worked on by

15:21.440 --> 15:27.520
humans when it rose above sea level due to tectonic uplift, between five and two thousand

15:27.520 --> 15:32.360
years ago, and he sent me a review of his book giving an age of just over two thousand

15:32.360 --> 15:34.960
years based on carbon dating.

15:34.960 --> 15:39.400
Schoch thought the structure was entirely natural, and that the steps and holes were

15:39.400 --> 15:41.340
erosion features.

15:41.340 --> 15:45.780
And although I didn't interview or quote John Anthony West, he had already written about

15:45.780 --> 15:52.320
the structure soon after visiting it, and also concluded that it was entirely natural.

15:52.320 --> 15:55.100
So this was quite an editing feat.

15:55.100 --> 15:58.680
Hancock consulted three experts about the Yonaguni monument.

15:58.680 --> 16:02.700
One of them thought it was most likely worked on by humans a little over two thousand years

16:02.700 --> 16:07.200
ago, and two of them thought the structure was entirely natural.

16:07.200 --> 16:11.020
Yet none of this expert opinion was conveyed to the viewer.

16:11.020 --> 16:16.060
Instead we're led exclusively to Hancock's conclusion that Yonaguni was probably carved

16:16.060 --> 16:19.820
twelve thousand years ago by a lost civilisation.

16:19.820 --> 16:27.100
Its presence here suggests a very sophisticated civilisation at an impossibly early date.

16:27.100 --> 16:31.300
Unfortunately I can't show you with images and sound alone how some of the cuts were

16:31.300 --> 16:34.880
made, but I'm sure you can spot these for yourselves.

16:34.880 --> 16:38.980
Remember you're not just listening for what's being said, you're looking to see what might

16:38.980 --> 16:40.660
have been cut.

16:40.660 --> 16:45.220
It's not that Channel 4 is worried about viewers getting free access to its programmes.

16:45.220 --> 16:49.780
As I said, Quest for the Lost Civilisation is freely available on YouTube, apparently

16:49.780 --> 16:53.180
with Channel 4's and Hancock's blessing.

16:53.180 --> 16:57.380
It's just that no one is allowed to use clips to critique the programme.

16:57.380 --> 17:02.620
As I learned from my experience with the New Scientist story, Hancock is very touchy about

17:02.620 --> 17:06.300
any criticism of his lost civilisation fantasy.

17:06.300 --> 17:11.780
If we dare show how he ignored expert opinion to sell his programme, heavens, people might

17:11.780 --> 17:15.060
start thinking there is no lost civilisation.

17:15.060 --> 17:18.100
And what would happen to all those books?

17:18.100 --> 17:22.620
If I ask people whether they trust what they see on television, I usually get a resounding

17:22.620 --> 17:24.080
no.

17:24.080 --> 17:28.700
Everyone seems to know that most television programmes are in the business of entertainment.

17:28.700 --> 17:32.900
Everyone knows TV producers can make you think you've seen something that never happened,

17:32.900 --> 17:35.180
or heard something that wasn't said.

17:35.180 --> 17:39.260
Yes, we all know it, but boy, we still fall for it.
