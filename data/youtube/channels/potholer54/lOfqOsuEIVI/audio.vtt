00:00.000 --> 00:05.520
A YouTuber called Suspicious Observers has just released a video which turns science on its head.

00:05.520 --> 00:10.240
So I thought it would be interesting to take a look. His premise is that we're about to be

00:10.240 --> 00:15.840
plunged into a glaciation based on misreading the conclusions of some scientific studies

00:15.840 --> 00:21.040
and his complete misunderstanding of how glaciations start. So let's begin half a minute

00:21.040 --> 00:26.240
in where he talks about the ice age, part of which is laid out here on his temperature graph.

00:27.200 --> 00:32.000
The ice melts, the planet heats up, the methane is released, and somehow every time we plunge

00:32.000 --> 00:38.160
into an ice age. Just to be clear, an ice age is made up of glacial and interglacial cycles,

00:38.160 --> 00:44.240
as shown on the graph. At the end of each cold glaciation, the ice melts and greenhouse gases

00:44.240 --> 00:49.200
are released. But we don't enter another glaciation, or an ice age as Suspicious

00:49.200 --> 00:54.560
Observer calls it. We get the opposite, an interglacial. That's not just in the textbooks,

00:54.560 --> 00:58.240
it's even clear from the reconstruction that Suspicious Observer is showing us.

00:59.200 --> 01:01.200
This is not disputed by anyone.

01:01.200 --> 01:06.720
Actually, it's disputed by every scientific paper that's ever been published over the last 30 years

01:06.720 --> 01:12.240
explaining the mechanism of glacial cycles. During the return to interglacial conditions,

01:12.240 --> 01:17.040
you can get a temporary step backwards, such as the brief return to glacial conditions during

01:17.040 --> 01:22.640
the Younger Dryas period, but the scientific literature clearly shows that when a glaciation

01:22.640 --> 01:29.280
ends, the ice melts and we enter an interglacial, as you can again clearly see from the reconstruction.

01:30.240 --> 01:34.880
And for more on this topic, you can investigate the well-understood Milankovitch cycles.

01:34.880 --> 01:39.440
Let's do that. Milankovitch cycles are changes in the Earth's orbit and tilt,

01:39.440 --> 01:45.680
sometimes called a wobble. Every 100,000 years or so, these changes cause a little more sunlight to

01:45.680 --> 01:51.360
hit part of the Earth, and this melts a little ice and releases greenhouse gases like methane

01:51.360 --> 01:58.000
and carbon dioxide. This amplifies the warming and brings us out of the glaciation. The same thing

01:58.000 --> 02:03.920
happens in reverse at the end of each glaciation. There's less sunlight, more ice, fewer greenhouse

02:03.920 --> 02:09.360
gases, and the Earth is plunged back into a glaciation. In other words, Milankovitch cycles

02:09.360 --> 02:15.280
don't do what Suspicious Observers is about to claim they do. It seems that ice concentrates at

02:15.360 --> 02:22.000
the polar region, dropping albedo and heating the planet. Okay, if ice accumulates, that means there's

02:22.000 --> 02:28.000
more ice, which increases albedo. The Earth's albedo is a measure of the amount of radiation

02:28.000 --> 02:35.040
it reflects, like sunlight. So once again, this timeline is 180 degrees the reverse of reality.

02:35.040 --> 02:41.520
When ice accumulates at the poles, it doesn't decrease albedo, it increases it, and that reflects

02:41.520 --> 02:48.320
more sunlight, which in turn can't possibly warm the planet. It cools it. So this is how peer

02:48.320 --> 02:53.280
reviewed scientific research explains the start of a glaciation, and you're more than welcome to

02:53.280 --> 02:57.760
check this with the sources I've listed in the video description or by getting a high school

02:57.760 --> 03:03.360
geology textbook from your local library. If you don't want to read anything that hard, simply

03:03.360 --> 03:09.360
google what causes glacial cycles. Lots of websites belonging to universities and scientific

03:09.360 --> 03:15.280
institutions will explain it. But let's continue from Suspicious Observer's conclusion that more

03:15.280 --> 03:21.120
ice warms the planet. I'll block out the top part to make it easier to follow. This eventually

03:21.120 --> 03:28.480
overtakes the polar region as well, melting that ice, releasing the methane, etc. Cold, fresh water

03:28.480 --> 03:33.840
and various atmospheric connections send us spiraling into an ice age thereafter. No, this is

03:33.840 --> 03:39.440
completely backwards. When you get higher temperatures as the result of Milankovitch cycles,

03:39.440 --> 03:45.200
and that melts ice and warms the poles, that causes lower albedo, more warming, releasing

03:45.200 --> 03:51.760
greenhouse gases, and marks the end of a glaciation. The result isn't another glaciation, it's an

03:51.760 --> 03:58.560
interglacial. So his timeline is a mixture of two completely opposite processes. Just this month we

03:58.560 --> 04:04.320
learned that part of that process may include that extra cold, fresh water creating a stratification

04:04.320 --> 04:10.320
in the oceans that halts convection, not to mention the Gulf Stream. No, that's not part of the process

04:10.320 --> 04:16.800
of glaciation, and the study Suspicious Observer is citing makes no such conclusion. Both the solar

04:16.800 --> 04:22.880
minimum physics at hand and the warming Arctic now present precisely the pattern that makes for the

04:22.880 --> 04:27.760
terrible snowstorms like we're seeing in New England this month, the earlier season storms

04:27.760 --> 04:33.120
from Europe, the Middle East and Asia as well. Well, clearly the tiny drop in solar activity isn't

04:33.120 --> 04:38.640
causing these colder winters, and the article Suspicious Observer cites doesn't say that either.

04:38.640 --> 04:44.400
That's just something he added himself. Global temperatures have been rising, but it's certainly

04:44.400 --> 04:50.480
true that most research has concluded that the warming Arctic and melting Arctic ice are creating

04:50.480 --> 04:55.600
a high pressure zone that's sending cold weather further south during the winter. In fact, that was

04:55.600 --> 05:03.280
predicted back in 2009, and I reported on it in 2010. And Suspicious Observer cites another study

05:03.280 --> 05:09.040
that shows global warming is melting ice in the Arctic Ocean so fast that it could at some point

05:09.040 --> 05:14.640
send fresh water south and disrupt the circulation system of the North Atlantic, bringing cooler

05:14.640 --> 05:20.720
conditions to Iceland and Northern Europe. But this study, like all the others, doesn't conclude

05:20.720 --> 05:26.080
that this will lead to another glaciation or anything like it. There's a bit of a circular

05:26.080 --> 05:30.960
problem here where everyone is finding signals of cold but exclaiming that all the other factors

05:30.960 --> 05:36.320
will overcome it to still warm the planet. Yes, that's why there's a distinction between global

05:36.320 --> 05:41.760
warming and climate change. Researchers are indeed finding that some parts of the Earth will get

05:41.760 --> 05:48.080
cooler in winter as cold air masses and ocean currents migrate. That's climate change. But

05:48.080 --> 05:53.840
researchers say the increasing concentration of carbon dioxide will continue to warm the planet

05:53.840 --> 06:00.480
as a whole. That's global warming. YouTubers and bloggers may not like that conclusion,

06:00.480 --> 06:06.160
but they have a responsibility not to misreport it simply because they don't like it. If you have

06:06.160 --> 06:11.920
a YouTube channel or a blog that thousands of people follow, including my own, you and I have

06:11.920 --> 06:17.200
a duty to report the science accurately. You can't pick and mix the bits of science you want to

06:17.200 --> 06:22.640
believe and discard the bits you don't like and then paste your own pet hypothesis on top and

06:22.640 --> 06:28.880
claim it's in the papers you're citing. Now for the whipped cream. Princeton captured the opponent's

06:28.880 --> 06:36.160
queen. Cloud cooling effects are underappreciated. They are a net cooling factor, not a net heating

06:36.160 --> 06:41.360
factor in the greenhouse sense. No, the study doesn't say that at all. I've read the Princeton

06:41.360 --> 06:47.040
website and the study itself, and neither says that clouds have a net cooling effect.

06:47.040 --> 06:50.720
That again is a conclusion suspicious observers made up himself.

06:51.600 --> 06:55.360
This isn't Venus, and our white clouds have perfect albedo.

06:55.360 --> 07:00.720
Perfect albedo would be 100%, meaning clouds reflect all the radiation they receive.

07:01.280 --> 07:07.920
In reality, the albedo of clouds varies between 10% and 90%. And of course, they also reflect

07:07.920 --> 07:12.720
radiation back downwards as well as upwards, and therefore trap heat.

07:12.720 --> 07:16.800
They published two more studies just this year confirming these effects,

07:16.800 --> 07:22.480
claiming that it wouldn't be enough to overcome A, B, C, D, and E, not realizing what they were

07:22.480 --> 07:27.440
saying either. Actually, researchers understand perfectly well what they're saying. They're

07:27.440 --> 07:32.240
saying quite clearly that even if the cooling effect of clouds has been underestimated,

07:32.240 --> 07:36.720
they say that doesn't invalidate climate projections. It doesn't change the fact

07:36.720 --> 07:41.680
that clouds also have a warming effect, it doesn't mean clouds have a net cooling effect,

07:41.680 --> 07:46.960
and it won't overcome the warming effect of carbon dioxide. In other words, it's not research

07:46.960 --> 07:51.680
scientists who don't understand what research scientists are saying, and I'll just leave it at

07:51.680 --> 07:57.120
that. I won't spend time going through the rest of Suspicious Observer's video, because anyone

07:57.120 --> 08:03.600
can do what I just did. Just check the papers he cites and find out what he's misread, misreported,

08:03.600 --> 08:10.400
or simply made up. To all those who unquestioningly believe him, it really is as simple as that.
