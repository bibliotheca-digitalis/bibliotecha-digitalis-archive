0	5520	A YouTuber called Suspicious Observers has just released a video which turns science on its head.
5520	10240	So I thought it would be interesting to take a look. His premise is that we're about to be
10240	15840	plunged into a glaciation based on misreading the conclusions of some scientific studies
15840	21040	and his complete misunderstanding of how glaciations start. So let's begin half a minute
21040	26240	in where he talks about the ice age, part of which is laid out here on his temperature graph.
27200	32000	The ice melts, the planet heats up, the methane is released, and somehow every time we plunge
32000	38160	into an ice age. Just to be clear, an ice age is made up of glacial and interglacial cycles,
38160	44240	as shown on the graph. At the end of each cold glaciation, the ice melts and greenhouse gases
44240	49200	are released. But we don't enter another glaciation, or an ice age as Suspicious
49200	54560	Observer calls it. We get the opposite, an interglacial. That's not just in the textbooks,
54560	58240	it's even clear from the reconstruction that Suspicious Observer is showing us.
59200	61200	This is not disputed by anyone.
61200	66720	Actually, it's disputed by every scientific paper that's ever been published over the last 30 years
66720	72240	explaining the mechanism of glacial cycles. During the return to interglacial conditions,
72240	77040	you can get a temporary step backwards, such as the brief return to glacial conditions during
77040	82640	the Younger Dryas period, but the scientific literature clearly shows that when a glaciation
82640	89280	ends, the ice melts and we enter an interglacial, as you can again clearly see from the reconstruction.
90240	94880	And for more on this topic, you can investigate the well-understood Milankovitch cycles.
94880	99440	Let's do that. Milankovitch cycles are changes in the Earth's orbit and tilt,
99440	105680	sometimes called a wobble. Every 100,000 years or so, these changes cause a little more sunlight to
105680	111360	hit part of the Earth, and this melts a little ice and releases greenhouse gases like methane
111360	118000	and carbon dioxide. This amplifies the warming and brings us out of the glaciation. The same thing
118000	123920	happens in reverse at the end of each glaciation. There's less sunlight, more ice, fewer greenhouse
123920	129360	gases, and the Earth is plunged back into a glaciation. In other words, Milankovitch cycles
129360	135280	don't do what Suspicious Observers is about to claim they do. It seems that ice concentrates at
135360	142000	the polar region, dropping albedo and heating the planet. Okay, if ice accumulates, that means there's
142000	148000	more ice, which increases albedo. The Earth's albedo is a measure of the amount of radiation
148000	155040	it reflects, like sunlight. So once again, this timeline is 180 degrees the reverse of reality.
155040	161520	When ice accumulates at the poles, it doesn't decrease albedo, it increases it, and that reflects
161520	168320	more sunlight, which in turn can't possibly warm the planet. It cools it. So this is how peer
168320	173280	reviewed scientific research explains the start of a glaciation, and you're more than welcome to
173280	177760	check this with the sources I've listed in the video description or by getting a high school
177760	183360	geology textbook from your local library. If you don't want to read anything that hard, simply
183360	189360	google what causes glacial cycles. Lots of websites belonging to universities and scientific
189360	195280	institutions will explain it. But let's continue from Suspicious Observer's conclusion that more
195280	201120	ice warms the planet. I'll block out the top part to make it easier to follow. This eventually
201120	208480	overtakes the polar region as well, melting that ice, releasing the methane, etc. Cold, fresh water
208480	213840	and various atmospheric connections send us spiraling into an ice age thereafter. No, this is
213840	219440	completely backwards. When you get higher temperatures as the result of Milankovitch cycles,
219440	225200	and that melts ice and warms the poles, that causes lower albedo, more warming, releasing
225200	231760	greenhouse gases, and marks the end of a glaciation. The result isn't another glaciation, it's an
231760	238560	interglacial. So his timeline is a mixture of two completely opposite processes. Just this month we
238560	244320	learned that part of that process may include that extra cold, fresh water creating a stratification
244320	250320	in the oceans that halts convection, not to mention the Gulf Stream. No, that's not part of the process
250320	256800	of glaciation, and the study Suspicious Observer is citing makes no such conclusion. Both the solar
256800	262880	minimum physics at hand and the warming Arctic now present precisely the pattern that makes for the
262880	267760	terrible snowstorms like we're seeing in New England this month, the earlier season storms
267760	273120	from Europe, the Middle East and Asia as well. Well, clearly the tiny drop in solar activity isn't
273120	278640	causing these colder winters, and the article Suspicious Observer cites doesn't say that either.
278640	284400	That's just something he added himself. Global temperatures have been rising, but it's certainly
284400	290480	true that most research has concluded that the warming Arctic and melting Arctic ice are creating
290480	295600	a high pressure zone that's sending cold weather further south during the winter. In fact, that was
295600	303280	predicted back in 2009, and I reported on it in 2010. And Suspicious Observer cites another study
303280	309040	that shows global warming is melting ice in the Arctic Ocean so fast that it could at some point
309040	314640	send fresh water south and disrupt the circulation system of the North Atlantic, bringing cooler
314640	320720	conditions to Iceland and Northern Europe. But this study, like all the others, doesn't conclude
320720	326080	that this will lead to another glaciation or anything like it. There's a bit of a circular
326080	330960	problem here where everyone is finding signals of cold but exclaiming that all the other factors
330960	336320	will overcome it to still warm the planet. Yes, that's why there's a distinction between global
336320	341760	warming and climate change. Researchers are indeed finding that some parts of the Earth will get
341760	348080	cooler in winter as cold air masses and ocean currents migrate. That's climate change. But
348080	353840	researchers say the increasing concentration of carbon dioxide will continue to warm the planet
353840	360480	as a whole. That's global warming. YouTubers and bloggers may not like that conclusion,
360480	366160	but they have a responsibility not to misreport it simply because they don't like it. If you have
366160	371920	a YouTube channel or a blog that thousands of people follow, including my own, you and I have
371920	377200	a duty to report the science accurately. You can't pick and mix the bits of science you want to
377200	382640	believe and discard the bits you don't like and then paste your own pet hypothesis on top and
382640	388880	claim it's in the papers you're citing. Now for the whipped cream. Princeton captured the opponent's
388880	396160	queen. Cloud cooling effects are underappreciated. They are a net cooling factor, not a net heating
396160	401360	factor in the greenhouse sense. No, the study doesn't say that at all. I've read the Princeton
401360	407040	website and the study itself, and neither says that clouds have a net cooling effect.
407040	410720	That again is a conclusion suspicious observers made up himself.
411600	415360	This isn't Venus, and our white clouds have perfect albedo.
415360	420720	Perfect albedo would be 100%, meaning clouds reflect all the radiation they receive.
421280	427920	In reality, the albedo of clouds varies between 10% and 90%. And of course, they also reflect
427920	432720	radiation back downwards as well as upwards, and therefore trap heat.
432720	436800	They published two more studies just this year confirming these effects,
436800	442480	claiming that it wouldn't be enough to overcome A, B, C, D, and E, not realizing what they were
442480	447440	saying either. Actually, researchers understand perfectly well what they're saying. They're
447440	452240	saying quite clearly that even if the cooling effect of clouds has been underestimated,
452240	456720	they say that doesn't invalidate climate projections. It doesn't change the fact
456720	461680	that clouds also have a warming effect, it doesn't mean clouds have a net cooling effect,
461680	466960	and it won't overcome the warming effect of carbon dioxide. In other words, it's not research
466960	471680	scientists who don't understand what research scientists are saying, and I'll just leave it at
471680	477120	that. I won't spend time going through the rest of Suspicious Observer's video, because anyone
477120	483600	can do what I just did. Just check the papers he cites and find out what he's misread, misreported,
483600	490400	or simply made up. To all those who unquestioningly believe him, it really is as simple as that.
