00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,520
A YouTuber called Suspicious Observers has just released a video which turns science on its head.

2
00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:10,240
So I thought it would be interesting to take a look. His premise is that we're about to be

3
00:00:10,240 --> 00:00:15,840
plunged into a glaciation based on misreading the conclusions of some scientific studies

4
00:00:15,840 --> 00:00:21,040
and his complete misunderstanding of how glaciations start. So let's begin half a minute

5
00:00:21,040 --> 00:00:26,240
in where he talks about the ice age, part of which is laid out here on his temperature graph.

6
00:00:27,200 --> 00:00:32,000
The ice melts, the planet heats up, the methane is released, and somehow every time we plunge

7
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:38,160
into an ice age. Just to be clear, an ice age is made up of glacial and interglacial cycles,

8
00:00:38,160 --> 00:00:44,240
as shown on the graph. At the end of each cold glaciation, the ice melts and greenhouse gases

9
00:00:44,240 --> 00:00:49,200
are released. But we don't enter another glaciation, or an ice age as Suspicious

10
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:54,560
Observer calls it. We get the opposite, an interglacial. That's not just in the textbooks,

11
00:00:54,560 --> 00:00:58,240
it's even clear from the reconstruction that Suspicious Observer is showing us.

12
00:00:59,200 --> 00:01:01,200
This is not disputed by anyone.

13
00:01:01,200 --> 00:01:06,720
Actually, it's disputed by every scientific paper that's ever been published over the last 30 years

14
00:01:06,720 --> 00:01:12,240
explaining the mechanism of glacial cycles. During the return to interglacial conditions,

15
00:01:12,240 --> 00:01:17,040
you can get a temporary step backwards, such as the brief return to glacial conditions during

16
00:01:17,040 --> 00:01:22,640
the Younger Dryas period, but the scientific literature clearly shows that when a glaciation

17
00:01:22,640 --> 00:01:29,280
ends, the ice melts and we enter an interglacial, as you can again clearly see from the reconstruction.

18
00:01:30,240 --> 00:01:34,880
And for more on this topic, you can investigate the well-understood Milankovitch cycles.

19
00:01:34,880 --> 00:01:39,440
Let's do that. Milankovitch cycles are changes in the Earth's orbit and tilt,

20
00:01:39,440 --> 00:01:45,680
sometimes called a wobble. Every 100,000 years or so, these changes cause a little more sunlight to

21
00:01:45,680 --> 00:01:51,360
hit part of the Earth, and this melts a little ice and releases greenhouse gases like methane

22
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:58,000
and carbon dioxide. This amplifies the warming and brings us out of the glaciation. The same thing

23
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:03,920
happens in reverse at the end of each glaciation. There's less sunlight, more ice, fewer greenhouse

24
00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:09,360
gases, and the Earth is plunged back into a glaciation. In other words, Milankovitch cycles

25
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:15,280
don't do what Suspicious Observers is about to claim they do. It seems that ice concentrates at

26
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:22,000
the polar region, dropping albedo and heating the planet. Okay, if ice accumulates, that means there's

27
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:28,000
more ice, which increases albedo. The Earth's albedo is a measure of the amount of radiation

28
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:35,040
it reflects, like sunlight. So once again, this timeline is 180 degrees the reverse of reality.

29
00:02:35,040 --> 00:02:41,520
When ice accumulates at the poles, it doesn't decrease albedo, it increases it, and that reflects

30
00:02:41,520 --> 00:02:48,320
more sunlight, which in turn can't possibly warm the planet. It cools it. So this is how peer

31
00:02:48,320 --> 00:02:53,280
reviewed scientific research explains the start of a glaciation, and you're more than welcome to

32
00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:57,760
check this with the sources I've listed in the video description or by getting a high school

33
00:02:57,760 --> 00:03:03,360
geology textbook from your local library. If you don't want to read anything that hard, simply

34
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:09,360
google what causes glacial cycles. Lots of websites belonging to universities and scientific

35
00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:15,280
institutions will explain it. But let's continue from Suspicious Observer's conclusion that more

36
00:03:15,280 --> 00:03:21,120
ice warms the planet. I'll block out the top part to make it easier to follow. This eventually

37
00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:28,480
overtakes the polar region as well, melting that ice, releasing the methane, etc. Cold, fresh water

38
00:03:28,480 --> 00:03:33,840
and various atmospheric connections send us spiraling into an ice age thereafter. No, this is

39
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:39,440
completely backwards. When you get higher temperatures as the result of Milankovitch cycles,

40
00:03:39,440 --> 00:03:45,200
and that melts ice and warms the poles, that causes lower albedo, more warming, releasing

41
00:03:45,200 --> 00:03:51,760
greenhouse gases, and marks the end of a glaciation. The result isn't another glaciation, it's an

42
00:03:51,760 --> 00:03:58,560
interglacial. So his timeline is a mixture of two completely opposite processes. Just this month we

43
00:03:58,560 --> 00:04:04,320
learned that part of that process may include that extra cold, fresh water creating a stratification

44
00:04:04,320 --> 00:04:10,320
in the oceans that halts convection, not to mention the Gulf Stream. No, that's not part of the process

45
00:04:10,320 --> 00:04:16,800
of glaciation, and the study Suspicious Observer is citing makes no such conclusion. Both the solar

46
00:04:16,800 --> 00:04:22,880
minimum physics at hand and the warming Arctic now present precisely the pattern that makes for the

47
00:04:22,880 --> 00:04:27,760
terrible snowstorms like we're seeing in New England this month, the earlier season storms

48
00:04:27,760 --> 00:04:33,120
from Europe, the Middle East and Asia as well. Well, clearly the tiny drop in solar activity isn't

49
00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:38,640
causing these colder winters, and the article Suspicious Observer cites doesn't say that either.

50
00:04:38,640 --> 00:04:44,400
That's just something he added himself. Global temperatures have been rising, but it's certainly

51
00:04:44,400 --> 00:04:50,480
true that most research has concluded that the warming Arctic and melting Arctic ice are creating

52
00:04:50,480 --> 00:04:55,600
a high pressure zone that's sending cold weather further south during the winter. In fact, that was

53
00:04:55,600 --> 00:05:03,280
predicted back in 2009, and I reported on it in 2010. And Suspicious Observer cites another study

54
00:05:03,280 --> 00:05:09,040
that shows global warming is melting ice in the Arctic Ocean so fast that it could at some point

55
00:05:09,040 --> 00:05:14,640
send fresh water south and disrupt the circulation system of the North Atlantic, bringing cooler

56
00:05:14,640 --> 00:05:20,720
conditions to Iceland and Northern Europe. But this study, like all the others, doesn't conclude

57
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:26,080
that this will lead to another glaciation or anything like it. There's a bit of a circular

58
00:05:26,080 --> 00:05:30,960
problem here where everyone is finding signals of cold but exclaiming that all the other factors

59
00:05:30,960 --> 00:05:36,320
will overcome it to still warm the planet. Yes, that's why there's a distinction between global

60
00:05:36,320 --> 00:05:41,760
warming and climate change. Researchers are indeed finding that some parts of the Earth will get

61
00:05:41,760 --> 00:05:48,080
cooler in winter as cold air masses and ocean currents migrate. That's climate change. But

62
00:05:48,080 --> 00:05:53,840
researchers say the increasing concentration of carbon dioxide will continue to warm the planet

63
00:05:53,840 --> 00:06:00,480
as a whole. That's global warming. YouTubers and bloggers may not like that conclusion,

64
00:06:00,480 --> 00:06:06,160
but they have a responsibility not to misreport it simply because they don't like it. If you have

65
00:06:06,160 --> 00:06:11,920
a YouTube channel or a blog that thousands of people follow, including my own, you and I have

66
00:06:11,920 --> 00:06:17,200
a duty to report the science accurately. You can't pick and mix the bits of science you want to

67
00:06:17,200 --> 00:06:22,640
believe and discard the bits you don't like and then paste your own pet hypothesis on top and

68
00:06:22,640 --> 00:06:28,880
claim it's in the papers you're citing. Now for the whipped cream. Princeton captured the opponent's

69
00:06:28,880 --> 00:06:36,160
queen. Cloud cooling effects are underappreciated. They are a net cooling factor, not a net heating

70
00:06:36,160 --> 00:06:41,360
factor in the greenhouse sense. No, the study doesn't say that at all. I've read the Princeton

71
00:06:41,360 --> 00:06:47,040
website and the study itself, and neither says that clouds have a net cooling effect.

72
00:06:47,040 --> 00:06:50,720
That again is a conclusion suspicious observers made up himself.

73
00:06:51,600 --> 00:06:55,360
This isn't Venus, and our white clouds have perfect albedo.

74
00:06:55,360 --> 00:07:00,720
Perfect albedo would be 100%, meaning clouds reflect all the radiation they receive.

75
00:07:01,280 --> 00:07:07,920
In reality, the albedo of clouds varies between 10% and 90%. And of course, they also reflect

76
00:07:07,920 --> 00:07:12,720
radiation back downwards as well as upwards, and therefore trap heat.

77
00:07:12,720 --> 00:07:16,800
They published two more studies just this year confirming these effects,

78
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:22,480
claiming that it wouldn't be enough to overcome A, B, C, D, and E, not realizing what they were

79
00:07:22,480 --> 00:07:27,440
saying either. Actually, researchers understand perfectly well what they're saying. They're

80
00:07:27,440 --> 00:07:32,240
saying quite clearly that even if the cooling effect of clouds has been underestimated,

81
00:07:32,240 --> 00:07:36,720
they say that doesn't invalidate climate projections. It doesn't change the fact

82
00:07:36,720 --> 00:07:41,680
that clouds also have a warming effect, it doesn't mean clouds have a net cooling effect,

83
00:07:41,680 --> 00:07:46,960
and it won't overcome the warming effect of carbon dioxide. In other words, it's not research

84
00:07:46,960 --> 00:07:51,680
scientists who don't understand what research scientists are saying, and I'll just leave it at

85
00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:57,120
that. I won't spend time going through the rest of Suspicious Observer's video, because anyone

86
00:07:57,120 --> 00:08:03,600
can do what I just did. Just check the papers he cites and find out what he's misread, misreported,

87
00:08:03,600 --> 00:08:10,400
or simply made up. To all those who unquestioningly believe him, it really is as simple as that.
