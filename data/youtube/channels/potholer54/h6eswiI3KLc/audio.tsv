0	5120	Recent claims on the internet and in the media that we're heading for a mini ice age are
5120	10720	just the latest in a long tradition of failed alarmist claims about a looming deep freeze,
10720	13120	going back to the 1970s.
13120	16120	So here's a quick chronology from this century.
16120	26200	In 2001, Don Easterbrook predicted the global chill would start between 2002 and 2012.
26200	27980	But of course it didn't.
27980	33420	If we compare Easterbrook's prediction to actual temperatures, it was completely wrong.
33420	37820	But researchers who predicted continued warming were completely right.
37820	43540	In 2005, two Russian solar physicists who predicted that lower solar activity would
43540	49580	see global temperatures fall were offered a $10,000 bet by climatologist James Annan
49580	51700	that temperatures would rise.
51700	54160	The solar physicists lost.
54160	58760	Actual temperatures did continue rising, just as Annan and other climate researchers
58760	59760	had predicted.
59760	67040	In 2007, David Archibald predicted that temperatures would drop by about 2 degrees by 2015.
67040	69280	He was wrong.
69280	74320	Temperatures continued rising, just as climate researchers had predicted.
74320	80860	In 2008, Easterbrook tried again, declaring that this time global warming really was over.
80860	83160	And the blog What's Up With That agreed.
83160	87580	It said, the predicted cooling seems to have already begun.
87580	88760	It hadn't.
88760	95620	Temperatures have continued rising since 2008, just as climate researchers had predicted.
95620	100880	The same year, two members of the Global Warming Policy Foundation made a Â£1,000 bet that
100880	104920	2015 would be colder than 2008.
104920	105920	They lost.
105920	108640	In 2009, Jay Lehrer predicted this.
108640	116160	We've seen very, very low sunspot activity, and we're definitely, in my mind, not only
116160	121020	in a cooling period, we're going to be staying in it for a couple decades.
121020	122020	We weren't.
122020	123020	We didn't.
123020	127760	Temperatures continued rising, just as climate researchers had predicted.
127760	132060	That same year, Henrik Spensmark declared, global warming has stopped, and the cooling
132060	133480	has begun.
133480	134520	He was wrong.
134520	139960	He added that no climate model has predicted cooling of the Earth, and on that he was right.
139960	146880	The climate models all predicted warming, and as predicted, the world did continue warming.
146880	153040	In 2010, Fox News warned of a big chill, complete with a picture of a frozen Statue of Liberty.
153040	158160	It quoted a speech by Don Easterbrook, who once again tried declaring global warming
158160	159300	over.
159300	163000	And from now, there really would be global cooling.
163000	168320	But temperatures continued rising, just as climate researchers had predicted.
168320	174480	In 2011, the New Zealand Climate Science Coalition predicted that 2011 would be the coolest year
174480	178400	globally since 1956, or even earlier.
178400	181860	It turned out to be the ninth warmest on record.
181860	186460	The same year, there was a prediction by three Norwegians that a drop in solar activity would
186460	192120	cause temperatures to plunge in Svalbard between 2009 and 2020.
192120	197740	In fact, temperatures rose, just as climate researchers had predicted.
197740	204920	In 2013, Kabibulo Abousatimov predicted that the Little Ice Age would begin in 2015.
204920	208480	But well, you don't need me to tell you what happened.
208480	215040	In 2014, Kevin Long predicted that 2015 would be the warmest year before a deep chill set
215040	216040	in.
216040	217040	It didn't.
217040	219820	The next five years were the hottest on record.
219820	224120	And that same year, Ole Humlum predicted a temperature decrease of up to one degree
224120	226780	centigrade by 2020.
226780	231040	We've had a temperature increase of 0.2 degrees.
231040	237300	In 2016, Habibulo Abousatimov, undaunted by his earlier failed prediction that the Little
237300	242980	Ice Age was supposed to have started in 2015, declared that the Little Ice Age had started
242980	244100	anyway.
244100	248320	It had begun in 2015, he said, and would continue.
248320	249320	It hadn't.
249320	250320	And it didn't.
250320	258600	2015, 2016, 2017, 2018 and 2019 were not years of mini ice age, but the hottest years on
258600	259600	record.
259600	266720	2016 turned out to be the hottest year on record, and 2019 was the second hottest.
266720	271740	Despite this trail of failed predictions, the looming mini ice age continues to be just
271740	276940	around the corner, contrary to nearly all peer-reviewed scientific studies.
276940	281660	And when this year's batch of blogosphere hysteria over 2020 being the start of the mini
281660	287500	ice age fails to materialise, it'll just shift to next year and then the year after
287500	288500	that.
288500	293180	Meanwhile, scientific predictions that we would not see global cooling but global warming
293180	295740	have all consistently borne out.
295740	300360	For more on this and more myth-busting about science, take a look at these two videos that
300360	302780	explain everything in more detail.
302780	303620	Thanks for watching.
