00:00.000 --> 00:05.120
Recent claims on the internet and in the media that we're heading for a mini ice age are

00:05.120 --> 00:10.720
just the latest in a long tradition of failed alarmist claims about a looming deep freeze,

00:10.720 --> 00:13.120
going back to the 1970s.

00:13.120 --> 00:16.120
So here's a quick chronology from this century.

00:16.120 --> 00:26.200
In 2001, Don Easterbrook predicted the global chill would start between 2002 and 2012.

00:26.200 --> 00:27.980
But of course it didn't.

00:27.980 --> 00:33.420
If we compare Easterbrook's prediction to actual temperatures, it was completely wrong.

00:33.420 --> 00:37.820
But researchers who predicted continued warming were completely right.

00:37.820 --> 00:43.540
In 2005, two Russian solar physicists who predicted that lower solar activity would

00:43.540 --> 00:49.580
see global temperatures fall were offered a $10,000 bet by climatologist James Annan

00:49.580 --> 00:51.700
that temperatures would rise.

00:51.700 --> 00:54.160
The solar physicists lost.

00:54.160 --> 00:58.760
Actual temperatures did continue rising, just as Annan and other climate researchers

00:58.760 --> 00:59.760
had predicted.

00:59.760 --> 01:07.040
In 2007, David Archibald predicted that temperatures would drop by about 2 degrees by 2015.

01:07.040 --> 01:09.280
He was wrong.

01:09.280 --> 01:14.320
Temperatures continued rising, just as climate researchers had predicted.

01:14.320 --> 01:20.860
In 2008, Easterbrook tried again, declaring that this time global warming really was over.

01:20.860 --> 01:23.160
And the blog What's Up With That agreed.

01:23.160 --> 01:27.580
It said, the predicted cooling seems to have already begun.

01:27.580 --> 01:28.760
It hadn't.

01:28.760 --> 01:35.620
Temperatures have continued rising since 2008, just as climate researchers had predicted.

01:35.620 --> 01:40.880
The same year, two members of the Global Warming Policy Foundation made a Â£1,000 bet that

01:40.880 --> 01:44.920
2015 would be colder than 2008.

01:44.920 --> 01:45.920
They lost.

01:45.920 --> 01:48.640
In 2009, Jay Lehrer predicted this.

01:48.640 --> 01:56.160
We've seen very, very low sunspot activity, and we're definitely, in my mind, not only

01:56.160 --> 02:01.020
in a cooling period, we're going to be staying in it for a couple decades.

02:01.020 --> 02:02.020
We weren't.

02:02.020 --> 02:03.020
We didn't.

02:03.020 --> 02:07.760
Temperatures continued rising, just as climate researchers had predicted.

02:07.760 --> 02:12.060
That same year, Henrik Spensmark declared, global warming has stopped, and the cooling

02:12.060 --> 02:13.480
has begun.

02:13.480 --> 02:14.520
He was wrong.

02:14.520 --> 02:19.960
He added that no climate model has predicted cooling of the Earth, and on that he was right.

02:19.960 --> 02:26.880
The climate models all predicted warming, and as predicted, the world did continue warming.

02:26.880 --> 02:33.040
In 2010, Fox News warned of a big chill, complete with a picture of a frozen Statue of Liberty.

02:33.040 --> 02:38.160
It quoted a speech by Don Easterbrook, who once again tried declaring global warming

02:38.160 --> 02:39.300
over.

02:39.300 --> 02:43.000
And from now, there really would be global cooling.

02:43.000 --> 02:48.320
But temperatures continued rising, just as climate researchers had predicted.

02:48.320 --> 02:54.480
In 2011, the New Zealand Climate Science Coalition predicted that 2011 would be the coolest year

02:54.480 --> 02:58.400
globally since 1956, or even earlier.

02:58.400 --> 03:01.860
It turned out to be the ninth warmest on record.

03:01.860 --> 03:06.460
The same year, there was a prediction by three Norwegians that a drop in solar activity would

03:06.460 --> 03:12.120
cause temperatures to plunge in Svalbard between 2009 and 2020.

03:12.120 --> 03:17.740
In fact, temperatures rose, just as climate researchers had predicted.

03:17.740 --> 03:24.920
In 2013, Kabibulo Abousatimov predicted that the Little Ice Age would begin in 2015.

03:24.920 --> 03:28.480
But well, you don't need me to tell you what happened.

03:28.480 --> 03:35.040
In 2014, Kevin Long predicted that 2015 would be the warmest year before a deep chill set

03:35.040 --> 03:36.040
in.

03:36.040 --> 03:37.040
It didn't.

03:37.040 --> 03:39.820
The next five years were the hottest on record.

03:39.820 --> 03:44.120
And that same year, Ole Humlum predicted a temperature decrease of up to one degree

03:44.120 --> 03:46.780
centigrade by 2020.

03:46.780 --> 03:51.040
We've had a temperature increase of 0.2 degrees.

03:51.040 --> 03:57.300
In 2016, Habibulo Abousatimov, undaunted by his earlier failed prediction that the Little

03:57.300 --> 04:02.980
Ice Age was supposed to have started in 2015, declared that the Little Ice Age had started

04:02.980 --> 04:04.100
anyway.

04:04.100 --> 04:08.320
It had begun in 2015, he said, and would continue.

04:08.320 --> 04:09.320
It hadn't.

04:09.320 --> 04:10.320
And it didn't.

04:10.320 --> 04:18.600
2015, 2016, 2017, 2018 and 2019 were not years of mini ice age, but the hottest years on

04:18.600 --> 04:19.600
record.

04:19.600 --> 04:26.720
2016 turned out to be the hottest year on record, and 2019 was the second hottest.

04:26.720 --> 04:31.740
Despite this trail of failed predictions, the looming mini ice age continues to be just

04:31.740 --> 04:36.940
around the corner, contrary to nearly all peer-reviewed scientific studies.

04:36.940 --> 04:41.660
And when this year's batch of blogosphere hysteria over 2020 being the start of the mini

04:41.660 --> 04:47.500
ice age fails to materialise, it'll just shift to next year and then the year after

04:47.500 --> 04:48.500
that.

04:48.500 --> 04:53.180
Meanwhile, scientific predictions that we would not see global cooling but global warming

04:53.180 --> 04:55.740
have all consistently borne out.

04:55.740 --> 05:00.360
For more on this and more myth-busting about science, take a look at these two videos that

05:00.360 --> 05:02.780
explain everything in more detail.

05:02.780 --> 05:03.620
Thanks for watching.
