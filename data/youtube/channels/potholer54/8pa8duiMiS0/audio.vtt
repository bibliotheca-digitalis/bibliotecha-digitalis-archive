00:00.000 --> 00:03.300
Hurricanes and global warming, is there a connection?

00:03.300 --> 00:07.300
What impression do you get when you watch this report lean in from NBC?

00:07.300 --> 00:11.800
As new storms brew in the Atlantic tonight, scientists studying the Earth's climate say

00:11.800 --> 00:17.000
we are experiencing stronger hurricanes in this century, a trend that's likely to continue.

00:17.000 --> 00:22.700
The impression NBC gives is that the storms being experienced at the time, back in 2005,

00:22.700 --> 00:26.700
were indeed linked to climate change and they'll get worse.

00:26.700 --> 00:32.200
Unfortunately, the scientific paper the news report is based on doesn't exactly say that.

00:32.200 --> 00:37.700
And other papers that NBC doesn't mention most emphatically don't say that.

00:37.700 --> 00:43.200
So let's look at what the peer-reviewed literature says, because science is advanced through research

00:43.200 --> 00:49.700
and research is written up in respected peer-reviewed journals, not the New York Times or NBC News.

00:49.700 --> 00:55.700
Tropical cyclones are called hurricanes in the North Atlantic and typhoons in most of the West Pacific.

00:55.700 --> 00:58.200
They get their energy from the warmth of the oceans.

00:58.200 --> 01:02.700
So as the oceans get warmer, the number of tropical cyclones increases.

01:02.700 --> 01:08.200
A 2008 study suggests that just a half degree rise in North Atlantic sea surface temperatures

01:08.200 --> 01:11.700
would increase the number of hurricanes by around 40%.

01:11.700 --> 01:18.200
In his movie An Inconvenient Truth, Al Gore implicated global warming, but it's not that simple.

01:18.200 --> 01:24.200
Climatologists say it's likely the increase in hurricanes we saw between 1995 and 2005

01:24.200 --> 01:29.700
is mainly due to a 60 to 80 year natural cycle, not global warming.

01:29.700 --> 01:33.700
By the way, this cycle, called the Atlantic multi-decadal oscillation,

01:33.700 --> 01:37.700
may also have contributed to the recent fall in the extent of summer sea ice,

01:37.700 --> 01:39.700
but I'll cover that in another video.

01:39.700 --> 01:43.700
Secondly, even though global warming will raise sea surface temperatures,

01:43.700 --> 01:47.700
that isn't the only factor that influences the formation of hurricanes.

01:47.700 --> 01:52.700
Another is the difference in temperature between the sea surface and the upper troposphere.

01:52.700 --> 01:56.200
And as global warming continues to warm the upper troposphere,

01:56.200 --> 02:00.200
this temperature difference is likely to decrease over the next century.

02:00.200 --> 02:04.200
Global warming also increases something called wind shear in the upper troposphere,

02:04.200 --> 02:08.200
that's the steepness of change as you cross wind speed contours.

02:08.200 --> 02:14.200
And greater wind shear has a habit of chopping off the tops of hurricanes before they get a chance to form.

02:14.200 --> 02:20.200
So if the effect of climate change is to decrease temperature differences and increase wind shear,

02:20.200 --> 02:25.700
doesn't that mean that increased global warming would lead to fewer hurricanes, not more?

02:25.700 --> 02:27.700
Well, yes.

02:27.700 --> 02:33.700
That was first postulated in a 1998 paper published in the Bulletin of the American Meteorological Society.

02:33.700 --> 02:38.700
The researchers tentatively concluded that a doubling of carbon dioxide levels in the atmosphere

02:38.700 --> 02:42.700
would probably not lead to more tropical cyclones on a global scale.

02:42.700 --> 02:49.700
The very modest available evidence points to an expectation of little or no change in global frequency.

02:50.200 --> 02:55.200
Over the next 10 years that modest evidence was added to substantially.

02:55.200 --> 03:01.200
In 2010 a definitive review of all the research and the data was undertaken by an expert panel

03:01.200 --> 03:04.200
and published in Nature Geoscience.

03:04.200 --> 03:09.200
Their report projected an 18% decline in the number of tropical cyclones by the end of the century

03:09.200 --> 03:13.200
and a 30% decline in the number reaching land.

03:13.200 --> 03:15.200
But there's a twist in the tale.

03:15.700 --> 03:19.700
While normal hurricanes would fail to form because of contrary atmospheric conditions

03:19.700 --> 03:23.700
these wouldn't be able to stop the strongest hurricanes from forming

03:23.700 --> 03:26.700
and because sea surface temperatures will be higher in future

03:26.700 --> 03:29.700
these strong hurricanes will be exceptionally strong.

03:29.700 --> 03:34.700
So the same research papers conclude that while overall the number of hurricanes will decline

03:34.700 --> 03:38.700
those that do occur will be especially strong.

03:38.700 --> 03:41.700
The Nature Geoscience paper estimated that the wind speed of hurricanes

03:42.200 --> 03:46.200
would probably increase 2 to 11% by the end of the century.

03:46.200 --> 03:52.200
That may not sound like much but a study by Emanuel concluded that a 10% increase in wind speed

03:52.200 --> 03:56.200
translates to roughly a 60% increase in damage.

03:56.200 --> 04:01.200
The next question facing researchers is has this process already begun?

04:01.200 --> 04:05.200
Are we already seeing stronger hurricanes because of climate change?

04:05.200 --> 04:10.200
A 2005 study published in Science found a large increase in the number and proportion

04:10.700 --> 04:15.700
of Category 4 and 5 tropical cyclones worldwide since 1970.

04:15.700 --> 04:19.700
That same year a paper published in Nature reached the same conclusion.

04:19.700 --> 04:23.700
A 2006 study analysed the cause of sea surface temperatures

04:23.700 --> 04:27.700
and found strong evidence that global warming is a factor.

04:27.700 --> 04:31.700
But it's impossible to discern with certainty how much current hurricane intensity

04:31.700 --> 04:36.700
might be due to global warming and how much is the result of natural variability.

04:36.700 --> 04:41.200
One thing all researchers agree on is that the length of the record is too short

04:41.200 --> 04:45.200
and the evidence too ambiguous to reach a firm conclusion.

04:45.200 --> 04:49.200
If this all sounds a bit complicated and messy, let me try to summarise.

04:49.200 --> 04:52.200
This is what most climatologists now agree on.

04:52.200 --> 04:56.200
There will be fewer tropical cyclones because of global warming

04:56.200 --> 04:59.200
but those storms that do make landfall will be more powerful.

04:59.200 --> 05:02.200
So there will be more strong storms.

05:02.200 --> 05:04.700
We're currently in a phase of heightened hurricane activity

05:04.700 --> 05:09.700
because of a natural 60 to 80 year cycle that began around 1995.

05:09.700 --> 05:12.700
And here's the main area of uncertainty.

05:12.700 --> 05:15.700
There is evidence to suggest that recent hurricanes

05:15.700 --> 05:17.700
may have been stronger because of global warming

05:17.700 --> 05:19.700
but this isn't conclusive.

05:19.700 --> 05:24.700
As I said at the start of this video, uncertainties like this don't make good headlines

05:24.700 --> 05:27.700
and linking Hurricane Katrina to global warming

05:28.200 --> 05:31.200
as some media did after the devastation of New Orleans

05:31.200 --> 05:33.200
is speculative claptrap.

05:33.200 --> 05:36.200
But media outlets trying to debunk climate science

05:36.200 --> 05:40.200
also misunderstand the link, sometimes with laughable results.

05:40.200 --> 05:44.200
Here's Brit Hume trying to show that hurricane activity has decreased

05:44.200 --> 05:49.700
The northern hemisphere is actually experiencing near historic inactivity so far in 2007.

05:49.700 --> 05:55.200
without realising that this is exactly what climate scientists say should happen due to global warming.

05:55.200 --> 06:01.200
Some global warming alarmists, you remember, issued predictions of an era of stronger and more frequent hurricanes

06:01.200 --> 06:03.700
following the devastating storms of 2005.

06:03.700 --> 06:09.700
But the warnings about more frequent hurricanes were related to a natural cycle, not global warming.

06:09.700 --> 06:13.200
By twisting the figures to claim that we're seeing fewer hurricanes,

06:13.200 --> 06:15.700
Hume is debunking the natural cycle

06:15.700 --> 06:19.700
and suggesting that the effects predicted for global warming are already upon us.

06:20.200 --> 06:22.200
Has Fox News come under new management?

06:22.200 --> 06:25.200
Or are its journalists so scientifically illiterate

06:25.200 --> 06:29.200
that they automatically try to undermine any scientific research

06:29.200 --> 06:33.200
and not recognise when it actually supports their editorial position?

06:33.200 --> 06:37.200
And Fox News wasn't the only one to get this hopelessly wrong.

06:37.200 --> 06:42.200
If conspiracy theorists read the scientific journals instead of internet chit-chat

06:42.200 --> 06:47.200
they'd know that most research papers do not say that global warming equals more hurricanes.

06:47.700 --> 06:49.700
And we can't take the opposite extreme

06:49.700 --> 06:52.700
and say that because we have a few years of fewer hurricanes

06:52.700 --> 06:55.700
that must be the effect of global warming.

06:55.700 --> 06:58.700
None of the models suggest that either.

06:58.700 --> 07:02.700
Let's move on to another popular assertion about the consequences of climate change.

07:03.200 --> 07:07.200
...only 16 feet above sea level at its highest point

07:07.200 --> 07:10.200
is now in danger of becoming a modern-day Atlantis.

07:10.200 --> 07:13.200
...the fear that the area could disappear within 50 years

07:13.200 --> 07:15.700
if action isn't taken over climate change.

07:15.700 --> 07:18.200
The image we get from the media is that low-lying atolls

07:18.200 --> 07:23.200
are going to be drowned under rising seas, disappear, a modern-day Atlantis.

07:23.200 --> 07:25.200
Apart from polar bears on icebergs,

07:25.200 --> 07:28.200
the precariously low-lying islands of the South Pacific

07:28.200 --> 07:31.200
are the poster children for global warming.

07:31.200 --> 07:34.700
But there's no evidence these islands are going to be inundated

07:34.700 --> 07:36.700
and what we know about how they form

07:36.700 --> 07:40.700
suggests they're more likely to do the opposite, grow bigger.

07:40.700 --> 07:44.700
To understand this you have to think about how these islands formed in the first place.

07:44.700 --> 07:47.700
We're not talking here about continental islands

07:47.700 --> 07:49.700
which are off-lying peaks separated from the mainland

07:49.700 --> 07:53.200
by rising sea levels at the end of the last ice age.

07:53.200 --> 07:56.700
True oceanic islands were created by volcanic activity

07:56.700 --> 07:58.700
in the middle of oceanic plates.

07:59.200 --> 08:03.200
But if many of these volcanoes eroded and disappeared millions of years ago

08:03.200 --> 08:05.200
why are the islands still here?

08:05.200 --> 08:10.200
The answer is that the coral fringe around them is alive and growing.

08:10.200 --> 08:14.200
Dead coral, either broken off by wave action or marine organisms,

08:14.200 --> 08:18.200
builds up to form an island and it's still building these islands today.

08:18.200 --> 08:20.200
This isn't exactly news.

08:20.200 --> 08:23.200
The process was first postulated by Charles Darwin

08:23.200 --> 08:26.200
and a number of papers have been published over the decades

08:26.700 --> 08:29.700
documenting the continuing growth of these islands.

08:29.700 --> 08:32.700
Although research continues, there's as yet little evidence

08:32.700 --> 08:36.700
that the expected rate of sea level rise will reverse that.

08:36.700 --> 08:39.700
In 2010, Arthur Webb and Paul Kench

08:39.700 --> 08:42.700
analysed hundreds of historical aerial photographs

08:42.700 --> 08:46.200
and confirmed that 23 out of 27 Pacific atolls

08:46.200 --> 08:51.700
are indeed either stable or growing in size, including Tuvalu.

08:51.700 --> 08:55.700
So why do climate scientists insist that these islands face problems?

08:56.200 --> 09:00.200
Well, the problems are related to other issues caused by climate change

09:00.200 --> 09:04.200
such as storm surges, coastal erosion and saline intrusion

09:04.200 --> 09:07.200
not total submergence from rising seas.

09:07.200 --> 09:09.200
But of course, the stability of the islands

09:09.200 --> 09:12.200
depends on the continuing health of the coral reefs

09:12.200 --> 09:14.200
which brings us on to this.

09:14.200 --> 09:17.200
What happens is that the tropical waters where they live

09:17.200 --> 09:19.200
are getting too warm

09:19.200 --> 09:22.200
and when they get warm, the corals actually purge.

09:22.200 --> 09:25.200
They literally blow out the zooxanthellae

09:25.200 --> 09:29.700
and when that happens, they go from vibrant purples, greens and reds

09:29.700 --> 09:32.700
to sort of dull oranges and whites.

09:32.700 --> 09:35.700
The corals actually die.

09:35.700 --> 09:37.700
The real story of coral and global warming

09:37.700 --> 09:40.700
is a bit like the game of good news, bad news.

09:40.700 --> 09:43.700
And the bad news, of course, is that there's no doubt

09:43.700 --> 09:46.700
that warmer waters can damage coral.

09:46.700 --> 09:50.200
Coral survive by forming a symbiotic relationship with algae

09:50.200 --> 09:51.700
which feed them.

09:51.700 --> 09:55.200
When average water temperatures increase by around 1°C

09:55.200 --> 09:58.200
the algae become unproductive and are expelled.

09:58.200 --> 10:01.200
This leaves the coral looking white and dead

10:01.200 --> 10:03.200
a process known as bleaching.

10:03.200 --> 10:05.200
But it doesn't mean the coral is dead

10:05.200 --> 10:08.200
it can recover as temperatures cool again.

10:08.200 --> 10:10.200
Well, that's the good news.

10:10.200 --> 10:13.200
The bad news is that several years of above average temperatures

10:13.200 --> 10:15.200
make this bleaching permanent

10:15.200 --> 10:17.200
and this has happened in parts of the Indian Ocean.

10:17.200 --> 10:20.200
Is there anything the coral can do to adapt?

10:20.200 --> 10:22.700
Well, one possibility is that they can change

10:22.700 --> 10:24.700
the type of algae they cohabit with

10:24.700 --> 10:27.700
to a type that will survive higher temperatures.

10:27.700 --> 10:31.700
In 2006, a study found that very few coral species can do this

10:31.700 --> 10:34.700
but the methodology and the data used to get this result

10:34.700 --> 10:37.700
were questioned the following year by two other researchers.

10:37.700 --> 10:40.200
They concluded that a lot of coral species

10:40.200 --> 10:42.700
could change the type of algae they employ

10:42.700 --> 10:45.700
so if they're right, we can chalk that up to good news.

10:45.700 --> 10:49.700
Even if coral do successfully switch to more heat tolerant algae

10:50.200 --> 10:53.200
known as Type D, these can only survive temperatures

10:53.200 --> 10:55.200
up to one and a half degrees higher.

10:55.200 --> 10:58.200
If water temperatures go any higher than that

10:58.200 --> 11:01.200
researchers say no suitable algae can survive.

11:01.200 --> 11:02.200
Good news?

11:02.200 --> 11:05.200
Well, coral may indeed die out where they stand today

11:05.200 --> 11:08.200
but they could grow instead in higher latitudes.

11:08.200 --> 11:09.200
What's the evidence?

11:09.200 --> 11:11.200
Well, about 6,000 years ago

11:11.200 --> 11:15.200
the sea around Tokyo was 1.2 to 1.7 degrees warmer

11:15.200 --> 11:18.200
than it is today and coral flourished.

11:18.200 --> 11:22.200
The bad news is that that success might not be replicated in the future.

11:22.200 --> 11:24.200
According to a report by the Pew Center

11:24.200 --> 11:27.700
human activity in many coastal areas is now intense

11:27.700 --> 11:31.700
and pollution and other factors may prevent coral from easily forming.

11:31.700 --> 11:33.700
But there's an even bigger reason

11:33.700 --> 11:36.700
the fact that nullifies a lot of the good news about coral

11:36.700 --> 11:39.700
it might be able to cope with the temperature of the water

11:39.700 --> 11:43.200
what it may not be able to fight is rising acidity

11:43.200 --> 11:45.700
as increasing carbon dioxide in the atmosphere

11:46.700 --> 11:48.200
to form carbonic acid

11:48.200 --> 11:53.200
and acid eats away the calcite shells in marine organisms including coral.

11:53.200 --> 11:55.700
But a study from Stanford University

11:55.700 --> 11:58.200
found that corals will only be affected

11:58.200 --> 12:01.700
when carbon dioxide levels reach 550 ppm

12:01.700 --> 12:04.700
that's expected to happen in 2050.

12:04.700 --> 12:07.700
Carbon dioxide dissolves better in colder water

12:07.700 --> 12:10.700
so cold oceans are feeling the effects first.

12:10.700 --> 12:13.200
I'll look at that in a later video.

12:13.200 --> 12:14.700
To be honest, on the whole

12:14.700 --> 12:17.700
most media don't do a bad job in reporting the science

12:17.700 --> 12:20.700
sometimes they do get it wrong quite spectacularly

12:20.700 --> 12:24.200
often newspaper headlines and two-minute TV news stories

12:24.200 --> 12:26.700
don't have room to report the complexities

12:26.700 --> 12:28.700
reflected in the science journals.

12:28.700 --> 12:32.700
The problem is, critics confuse these headlines with real science

12:32.700 --> 12:35.700
so when inaccurate and hyped stories in the media

12:35.700 --> 12:37.200
are shown to be wrong

12:37.200 --> 12:39.700
it's assumed that the science was wrong.

12:39.700 --> 12:42.700
Anyone who's watched my video series from the beginning

12:42.700 --> 12:45.200
knows it's a familiar pattern.
