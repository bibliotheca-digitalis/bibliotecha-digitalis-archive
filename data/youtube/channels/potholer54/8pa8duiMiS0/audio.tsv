0	3300	Hurricanes and global warming, is there a connection?
3300	7300	What impression do you get when you watch this report lean in from NBC?
7300	11800	As new storms brew in the Atlantic tonight, scientists studying the Earth's climate say
11800	17000	we are experiencing stronger hurricanes in this century, a trend that's likely to continue.
17000	22700	The impression NBC gives is that the storms being experienced at the time, back in 2005,
22700	26700	were indeed linked to climate change and they'll get worse.
26700	32200	Unfortunately, the scientific paper the news report is based on doesn't exactly say that.
32200	37700	And other papers that NBC doesn't mention most emphatically don't say that.
37700	43200	So let's look at what the peer-reviewed literature says, because science is advanced through research
43200	49700	and research is written up in respected peer-reviewed journals, not the New York Times or NBC News.
49700	55700	Tropical cyclones are called hurricanes in the North Atlantic and typhoons in most of the West Pacific.
55700	58200	They get their energy from the warmth of the oceans.
58200	62700	So as the oceans get warmer, the number of tropical cyclones increases.
62700	68200	A 2008 study suggests that just a half degree rise in North Atlantic sea surface temperatures
68200	71700	would increase the number of hurricanes by around 40%.
71700	78200	In his movie An Inconvenient Truth, Al Gore implicated global warming, but it's not that simple.
78200	84200	Climatologists say it's likely the increase in hurricanes we saw between 1995 and 2005
84200	89700	is mainly due to a 60 to 80 year natural cycle, not global warming.
89700	93700	By the way, this cycle, called the Atlantic multi-decadal oscillation,
93700	97700	may also have contributed to the recent fall in the extent of summer sea ice,
97700	99700	but I'll cover that in another video.
99700	103700	Secondly, even though global warming will raise sea surface temperatures,
103700	107700	that isn't the only factor that influences the formation of hurricanes.
107700	112700	Another is the difference in temperature between the sea surface and the upper troposphere.
112700	116200	And as global warming continues to warm the upper troposphere,
116200	120200	this temperature difference is likely to decrease over the next century.
120200	124200	Global warming also increases something called wind shear in the upper troposphere,
124200	128200	that's the steepness of change as you cross wind speed contours.
128200	134200	And greater wind shear has a habit of chopping off the tops of hurricanes before they get a chance to form.
134200	140200	So if the effect of climate change is to decrease temperature differences and increase wind shear,
140200	145700	doesn't that mean that increased global warming would lead to fewer hurricanes, not more?
145700	147700	Well, yes.
147700	153700	That was first postulated in a 1998 paper published in the Bulletin of the American Meteorological Society.
153700	158700	The researchers tentatively concluded that a doubling of carbon dioxide levels in the atmosphere
158700	162700	would probably not lead to more tropical cyclones on a global scale.
162700	169700	The very modest available evidence points to an expectation of little or no change in global frequency.
170200	175200	Over the next 10 years that modest evidence was added to substantially.
175200	181200	In 2010 a definitive review of all the research and the data was undertaken by an expert panel
181200	184200	and published in Nature Geoscience.
184200	189200	Their report projected an 18% decline in the number of tropical cyclones by the end of the century
189200	193200	and a 30% decline in the number reaching land.
193200	195200	But there's a twist in the tale.
195700	199700	While normal hurricanes would fail to form because of contrary atmospheric conditions
199700	203700	these wouldn't be able to stop the strongest hurricanes from forming
203700	206700	and because sea surface temperatures will be higher in future
206700	209700	these strong hurricanes will be exceptionally strong.
209700	214700	So the same research papers conclude that while overall the number of hurricanes will decline
214700	218700	those that do occur will be especially strong.
218700	221700	The Nature Geoscience paper estimated that the wind speed of hurricanes
222200	226200	would probably increase 2 to 11% by the end of the century.
226200	232200	That may not sound like much but a study by Emanuel concluded that a 10% increase in wind speed
232200	236200	translates to roughly a 60% increase in damage.
236200	241200	The next question facing researchers is has this process already begun?
241200	245200	Are we already seeing stronger hurricanes because of climate change?
245200	250200	A 2005 study published in Science found a large increase in the number and proportion
250700	255700	of Category 4 and 5 tropical cyclones worldwide since 1970.
255700	259700	That same year a paper published in Nature reached the same conclusion.
259700	263700	A 2006 study analysed the cause of sea surface temperatures
263700	267700	and found strong evidence that global warming is a factor.
267700	271700	But it's impossible to discern with certainty how much current hurricane intensity
271700	276700	might be due to global warming and how much is the result of natural variability.
276700	281200	One thing all researchers agree on is that the length of the record is too short
281200	285200	and the evidence too ambiguous to reach a firm conclusion.
285200	289200	If this all sounds a bit complicated and messy, let me try to summarise.
289200	292200	This is what most climatologists now agree on.
292200	296200	There will be fewer tropical cyclones because of global warming
296200	299200	but those storms that do make landfall will be more powerful.
299200	302200	So there will be more strong storms.
302200	304700	We're currently in a phase of heightened hurricane activity
304700	309700	because of a natural 60 to 80 year cycle that began around 1995.
309700	312700	And here's the main area of uncertainty.
312700	315700	There is evidence to suggest that recent hurricanes
315700	317700	may have been stronger because of global warming
317700	319700	but this isn't conclusive.
319700	324700	As I said at the start of this video, uncertainties like this don't make good headlines
324700	327700	and linking Hurricane Katrina to global warming
328200	331200	as some media did after the devastation of New Orleans
331200	333200	is speculative claptrap.
333200	336200	But media outlets trying to debunk climate science
336200	340200	also misunderstand the link, sometimes with laughable results.
340200	344200	Here's Brit Hume trying to show that hurricane activity has decreased
344200	349700	The northern hemisphere is actually experiencing near historic inactivity so far in 2007.
349700	355200	without realising that this is exactly what climate scientists say should happen due to global warming.
355200	361200	Some global warming alarmists, you remember, issued predictions of an era of stronger and more frequent hurricanes
361200	363700	following the devastating storms of 2005.
363700	369700	But the warnings about more frequent hurricanes were related to a natural cycle, not global warming.
369700	373200	By twisting the figures to claim that we're seeing fewer hurricanes,
373200	375700	Hume is debunking the natural cycle
375700	379700	and suggesting that the effects predicted for global warming are already upon us.
380200	382200	Has Fox News come under new management?
382200	385200	Or are its journalists so scientifically illiterate
385200	389200	that they automatically try to undermine any scientific research
389200	393200	and not recognise when it actually supports their editorial position?
393200	397200	And Fox News wasn't the only one to get this hopelessly wrong.
397200	402200	If conspiracy theorists read the scientific journals instead of internet chit-chat
402200	407200	they'd know that most research papers do not say that global warming equals more hurricanes.
407700	409700	And we can't take the opposite extreme
409700	412700	and say that because we have a few years of fewer hurricanes
412700	415700	that must be the effect of global warming.
415700	418700	None of the models suggest that either.
418700	422700	Let's move on to another popular assertion about the consequences of climate change.
423200	427200	...only 16 feet above sea level at its highest point
427200	430200	is now in danger of becoming a modern-day Atlantis.
430200	433200	...the fear that the area could disappear within 50 years
433200	435700	if action isn't taken over climate change.
435700	438200	The image we get from the media is that low-lying atolls
438200	443200	are going to be drowned under rising seas, disappear, a modern-day Atlantis.
443200	445200	Apart from polar bears on icebergs,
445200	448200	the precariously low-lying islands of the South Pacific
448200	451200	are the poster children for global warming.
451200	454700	But there's no evidence these islands are going to be inundated
454700	456700	and what we know about how they form
456700	460700	suggests they're more likely to do the opposite, grow bigger.
460700	464700	To understand this you have to think about how these islands formed in the first place.
464700	467700	We're not talking here about continental islands
467700	469700	which are off-lying peaks separated from the mainland
469700	473200	by rising sea levels at the end of the last ice age.
473200	476700	True oceanic islands were created by volcanic activity
476700	478700	in the middle of oceanic plates.
479200	483200	But if many of these volcanoes eroded and disappeared millions of years ago
483200	485200	why are the islands still here?
485200	490200	The answer is that the coral fringe around them is alive and growing.
490200	494200	Dead coral, either broken off by wave action or marine organisms,
494200	498200	builds up to form an island and it's still building these islands today.
498200	500200	This isn't exactly news.
500200	503200	The process was first postulated by Charles Darwin
503200	506200	and a number of papers have been published over the decades
506700	509700	documenting the continuing growth of these islands.
509700	512700	Although research continues, there's as yet little evidence
512700	516700	that the expected rate of sea level rise will reverse that.
516700	519700	In 2010, Arthur Webb and Paul Kench
519700	522700	analysed hundreds of historical aerial photographs
522700	526200	and confirmed that 23 out of 27 Pacific atolls
526200	531700	are indeed either stable or growing in size, including Tuvalu.
531700	535700	So why do climate scientists insist that these islands face problems?
536200	540200	Well, the problems are related to other issues caused by climate change
540200	544200	such as storm surges, coastal erosion and saline intrusion
544200	547200	not total submergence from rising seas.
547200	549200	But of course, the stability of the islands
549200	552200	depends on the continuing health of the coral reefs
552200	554200	which brings us on to this.
554200	557200	What happens is that the tropical waters where they live
557200	559200	are getting too warm
559200	562200	and when they get warm, the corals actually purge.
562200	565200	They literally blow out the zooxanthellae
565200	569700	and when that happens, they go from vibrant purples, greens and reds
569700	572700	to sort of dull oranges and whites.
572700	575700	The corals actually die.
575700	577700	The real story of coral and global warming
577700	580700	is a bit like the game of good news, bad news.
580700	583700	And the bad news, of course, is that there's no doubt
583700	586700	that warmer waters can damage coral.
586700	590200	Coral survive by forming a symbiotic relationship with algae
590200	591700	which feed them.
591700	595200	When average water temperatures increase by around 1°C
595200	598200	the algae become unproductive and are expelled.
598200	601200	This leaves the coral looking white and dead
601200	603200	a process known as bleaching.
603200	605200	But it doesn't mean the coral is dead
605200	608200	it can recover as temperatures cool again.
608200	610200	Well, that's the good news.
610200	613200	The bad news is that several years of above average temperatures
613200	615200	make this bleaching permanent
615200	617200	and this has happened in parts of the Indian Ocean.
617200	620200	Is there anything the coral can do to adapt?
620200	622700	Well, one possibility is that they can change
622700	624700	the type of algae they cohabit with
624700	627700	to a type that will survive higher temperatures.
627700	631700	In 2006, a study found that very few coral species can do this
631700	634700	but the methodology and the data used to get this result
634700	637700	were questioned the following year by two other researchers.
637700	640200	They concluded that a lot of coral species
640200	642700	could change the type of algae they employ
642700	645700	so if they're right, we can chalk that up to good news.
645700	649700	Even if coral do successfully switch to more heat tolerant algae
650200	653200	known as Type D, these can only survive temperatures
653200	655200	up to one and a half degrees higher.
655200	658200	If water temperatures go any higher than that
658200	661200	researchers say no suitable algae can survive.
661200	662200	Good news?
662200	665200	Well, coral may indeed die out where they stand today
665200	668200	but they could grow instead in higher latitudes.
668200	669200	What's the evidence?
669200	671200	Well, about 6,000 years ago
671200	675200	the sea around Tokyo was 1.2 to 1.7 degrees warmer
675200	678200	than it is today and coral flourished.
678200	682200	The bad news is that that success might not be replicated in the future.
682200	684200	According to a report by the Pew Center
684200	687700	human activity in many coastal areas is now intense
687700	691700	and pollution and other factors may prevent coral from easily forming.
691700	693700	But there's an even bigger reason
693700	696700	the fact that nullifies a lot of the good news about coral
696700	699700	it might be able to cope with the temperature of the water
699700	703200	what it may not be able to fight is rising acidity
703200	705700	as increasing carbon dioxide in the atmosphere
706700	708200	to form carbonic acid
708200	713200	and acid eats away the calcite shells in marine organisms including coral.
713200	715700	But a study from Stanford University
715700	718200	found that corals will only be affected
718200	721700	when carbon dioxide levels reach 550 ppm
721700	724700	that's expected to happen in 2050.
724700	727700	Carbon dioxide dissolves better in colder water
727700	730700	so cold oceans are feeling the effects first.
730700	733200	I'll look at that in a later video.
733200	734700	To be honest, on the whole
734700	737700	most media don't do a bad job in reporting the science
737700	740700	sometimes they do get it wrong quite spectacularly
740700	744200	often newspaper headlines and two-minute TV news stories
744200	746700	don't have room to report the complexities
746700	748700	reflected in the science journals.
748700	752700	The problem is, critics confuse these headlines with real science
752700	755700	so when inaccurate and hyped stories in the media
755700	757200	are shown to be wrong
757200	759700	it's assumed that the science was wrong.
759700	762700	Anyone who's watched my video series from the beginning
762700	765200	knows it's a familiar pattern.
