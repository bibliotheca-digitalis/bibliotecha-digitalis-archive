1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,300
Hurricanes and global warming, is there a connection?

2
00:00:03,300 --> 00:00:07,300
What impression do you get when you watch this report lean in from NBC?

3
00:00:07,300 --> 00:00:11,800
As new storms brew in the Atlantic tonight, scientists studying the Earth's climate say

4
00:00:11,800 --> 00:00:17,000
we are experiencing stronger hurricanes in this century, a trend that's likely to continue.

5
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:22,700
The impression NBC gives is that the storms being experienced at the time, back in 2005,

6
00:00:22,700 --> 00:00:26,700
were indeed linked to climate change and they'll get worse.

7
00:00:26,700 --> 00:00:32,200
Unfortunately, the scientific paper the news report is based on doesn't exactly say that.

8
00:00:32,200 --> 00:00:37,700
And other papers that NBC doesn't mention most emphatically don't say that.

9
00:00:37,700 --> 00:00:43,200
So let's look at what the peer-reviewed literature says, because science is advanced through research

10
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:49,700
and research is written up in respected peer-reviewed journals, not the New York Times or NBC News.

11
00:00:49,700 --> 00:00:55,700
Tropical cyclones are called hurricanes in the North Atlantic and typhoons in most of the West Pacific.

12
00:00:55,700 --> 00:00:58,200
They get their energy from the warmth of the oceans.

13
00:00:58,200 --> 00:01:02,700
So as the oceans get warmer, the number of tropical cyclones increases.

14
00:01:02,700 --> 00:01:08,200
A 2008 study suggests that just a half degree rise in North Atlantic sea surface temperatures

15
00:01:08,200 --> 00:01:11,700
would increase the number of hurricanes by around 40%.

16
00:01:11,700 --> 00:01:18,200
In his movie An Inconvenient Truth, Al Gore implicated global warming, but it's not that simple.

17
00:01:18,200 --> 00:01:24,200
Climatologists say it's likely the increase in hurricanes we saw between 1995 and 2005

18
00:01:24,200 --> 00:01:29,700
is mainly due to a 60 to 80 year natural cycle, not global warming.

19
00:01:29,700 --> 00:01:33,700
By the way, this cycle, called the Atlantic multi-decadal oscillation,

20
00:01:33,700 --> 00:01:37,700
may also have contributed to the recent fall in the extent of summer sea ice,

21
00:01:37,700 --> 00:01:39,700
but I'll cover that in another video.

22
00:01:39,700 --> 00:01:43,700
Secondly, even though global warming will raise sea surface temperatures,

23
00:01:43,700 --> 00:01:47,700
that isn't the only factor that influences the formation of hurricanes.

24
00:01:47,700 --> 00:01:52,700
Another is the difference in temperature between the sea surface and the upper troposphere.

25
00:01:52,700 --> 00:01:56,200
And as global warming continues to warm the upper troposphere,

26
00:01:56,200 --> 00:02:00,200
this temperature difference is likely to decrease over the next century.

27
00:02:00,200 --> 00:02:04,200
Global warming also increases something called wind shear in the upper troposphere,

28
00:02:04,200 --> 00:02:08,200
that's the steepness of change as you cross wind speed contours.

29
00:02:08,200 --> 00:02:14,200
And greater wind shear has a habit of chopping off the tops of hurricanes before they get a chance to form.

30
00:02:14,200 --> 00:02:20,200
So if the effect of climate change is to decrease temperature differences and increase wind shear,

31
00:02:20,200 --> 00:02:25,700
doesn't that mean that increased global warming would lead to fewer hurricanes, not more?

32
00:02:25,700 --> 00:02:27,700
Well, yes.

33
00:02:27,700 --> 00:02:33,700
That was first postulated in a 1998 paper published in the Bulletin of the American Meteorological Society.

34
00:02:33,700 --> 00:02:38,700
The researchers tentatively concluded that a doubling of carbon dioxide levels in the atmosphere

35
00:02:38,700 --> 00:02:42,700
would probably not lead to more tropical cyclones on a global scale.

36
00:02:42,700 --> 00:02:49,700
The very modest available evidence points to an expectation of little or no change in global frequency.

37
00:02:50,200 --> 00:02:55,200
Over the next 10 years that modest evidence was added to substantially.

38
00:02:55,200 --> 00:03:01,200
In 2010 a definitive review of all the research and the data was undertaken by an expert panel

39
00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:04,200
and published in Nature Geoscience.

40
00:03:04,200 --> 00:03:09,200
Their report projected an 18% decline in the number of tropical cyclones by the end of the century

41
00:03:09,200 --> 00:03:13,200
and a 30% decline in the number reaching land.

42
00:03:13,200 --> 00:03:15,200
But there's a twist in the tale.

43
00:03:15,700 --> 00:03:19,700
While normal hurricanes would fail to form because of contrary atmospheric conditions

44
00:03:19,700 --> 00:03:23,700
these wouldn't be able to stop the strongest hurricanes from forming

45
00:03:23,700 --> 00:03:26,700
and because sea surface temperatures will be higher in future

46
00:03:26,700 --> 00:03:29,700
these strong hurricanes will be exceptionally strong.

47
00:03:29,700 --> 00:03:34,700
So the same research papers conclude that while overall the number of hurricanes will decline

48
00:03:34,700 --> 00:03:38,700
those that do occur will be especially strong.

49
00:03:38,700 --> 00:03:41,700
The Nature Geoscience paper estimated that the wind speed of hurricanes

50
00:03:42,200 --> 00:03:46,200
would probably increase 2 to 11% by the end of the century.

51
00:03:46,200 --> 00:03:52,200
That may not sound like much but a study by Emanuel concluded that a 10% increase in wind speed

52
00:03:52,200 --> 00:03:56,200
translates to roughly a 60% increase in damage.

53
00:03:56,200 --> 00:04:01,200
The next question facing researchers is has this process already begun?

54
00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:05,200
Are we already seeing stronger hurricanes because of climate change?

55
00:04:05,200 --> 00:04:10,200
A 2005 study published in Science found a large increase in the number and proportion

56
00:04:10,700 --> 00:04:15,700
of Category 4 and 5 tropical cyclones worldwide since 1970.

57
00:04:15,700 --> 00:04:19,700
That same year a paper published in Nature reached the same conclusion.

58
00:04:19,700 --> 00:04:23,700
A 2006 study analysed the cause of sea surface temperatures

59
00:04:23,700 --> 00:04:27,700
and found strong evidence that global warming is a factor.

60
00:04:27,700 --> 00:04:31,700
But it's impossible to discern with certainty how much current hurricane intensity

61
00:04:31,700 --> 00:04:36,700
might be due to global warming and how much is the result of natural variability.

62
00:04:36,700 --> 00:04:41,200
One thing all researchers agree on is that the length of the record is too short

63
00:04:41,200 --> 00:04:45,200
and the evidence too ambiguous to reach a firm conclusion.

64
00:04:45,200 --> 00:04:49,200
If this all sounds a bit complicated and messy, let me try to summarise.

65
00:04:49,200 --> 00:04:52,200
This is what most climatologists now agree on.

66
00:04:52,200 --> 00:04:56,200
There will be fewer tropical cyclones because of global warming

67
00:04:56,200 --> 00:04:59,200
but those storms that do make landfall will be more powerful.

68
00:04:59,200 --> 00:05:02,200
So there will be more strong storms.

69
00:05:02,200 --> 00:05:04,700
We're currently in a phase of heightened hurricane activity

70
00:05:04,700 --> 00:05:09,700
because of a natural 60 to 80 year cycle that began around 1995.

71
00:05:09,700 --> 00:05:12,700
And here's the main area of uncertainty.

72
00:05:12,700 --> 00:05:15,700
There is evidence to suggest that recent hurricanes

73
00:05:15,700 --> 00:05:17,700
may have been stronger because of global warming

74
00:05:17,700 --> 00:05:19,700
but this isn't conclusive.

75
00:05:19,700 --> 00:05:24,700
As I said at the start of this video, uncertainties like this don't make good headlines

76
00:05:24,700 --> 00:05:27,700
and linking Hurricane Katrina to global warming

77
00:05:28,200 --> 00:05:31,200
as some media did after the devastation of New Orleans

78
00:05:31,200 --> 00:05:33,200
is speculative claptrap.

79
00:05:33,200 --> 00:05:36,200
But media outlets trying to debunk climate science

80
00:05:36,200 --> 00:05:40,200
also misunderstand the link, sometimes with laughable results.

81
00:05:40,200 --> 00:05:44,200
Here's Brit Hume trying to show that hurricane activity has decreased

82
00:05:44,200 --> 00:05:49,700
The northern hemisphere is actually experiencing near historic inactivity so far in 2007.

83
00:05:49,700 --> 00:05:55,200
without realising that this is exactly what climate scientists say should happen due to global warming.

84
00:05:55,200 --> 00:06:01,200
Some global warming alarmists, you remember, issued predictions of an era of stronger and more frequent hurricanes

85
00:06:01,200 --> 00:06:03,700
following the devastating storms of 2005.

86
00:06:03,700 --> 00:06:09,700
But the warnings about more frequent hurricanes were related to a natural cycle, not global warming.

87
00:06:09,700 --> 00:06:13,200
By twisting the figures to claim that we're seeing fewer hurricanes,

88
00:06:13,200 --> 00:06:15,700
Hume is debunking the natural cycle

89
00:06:15,700 --> 00:06:19,700
and suggesting that the effects predicted for global warming are already upon us.

90
00:06:20,200 --> 00:06:22,200
Has Fox News come under new management?

91
00:06:22,200 --> 00:06:25,200
Or are its journalists so scientifically illiterate

92
00:06:25,200 --> 00:06:29,200
that they automatically try to undermine any scientific research

93
00:06:29,200 --> 00:06:33,200
and not recognise when it actually supports their editorial position?

94
00:06:33,200 --> 00:06:37,200
And Fox News wasn't the only one to get this hopelessly wrong.

95
00:06:37,200 --> 00:06:42,200
If conspiracy theorists read the scientific journals instead of internet chit-chat

96
00:06:42,200 --> 00:06:47,200
they'd know that most research papers do not say that global warming equals more hurricanes.

97
00:06:47,700 --> 00:06:49,700
And we can't take the opposite extreme

98
00:06:49,700 --> 00:06:52,700
and say that because we have a few years of fewer hurricanes

99
00:06:52,700 --> 00:06:55,700
that must be the effect of global warming.

100
00:06:55,700 --> 00:06:58,700
None of the models suggest that either.

101
00:06:58,700 --> 00:07:02,700
Let's move on to another popular assertion about the consequences of climate change.

102
00:07:03,200 --> 00:07:07,200
...only 16 feet above sea level at its highest point

103
00:07:07,200 --> 00:07:10,200
is now in danger of becoming a modern-day Atlantis.

104
00:07:10,200 --> 00:07:13,200
...the fear that the area could disappear within 50 years

105
00:07:13,200 --> 00:07:15,700
if action isn't taken over climate change.

106
00:07:15,700 --> 00:07:18,200
The image we get from the media is that low-lying atolls

107
00:07:18,200 --> 00:07:23,200
are going to be drowned under rising seas, disappear, a modern-day Atlantis.

108
00:07:23,200 --> 00:07:25,200
Apart from polar bears on icebergs,

109
00:07:25,200 --> 00:07:28,200
the precariously low-lying islands of the South Pacific

110
00:07:28,200 --> 00:07:31,200
are the poster children for global warming.

111
00:07:31,200 --> 00:07:34,700
But there's no evidence these islands are going to be inundated

112
00:07:34,700 --> 00:07:36,700
and what we know about how they form

113
00:07:36,700 --> 00:07:40,700
suggests they're more likely to do the opposite, grow bigger.

114
00:07:40,700 --> 00:07:44,700
To understand this you have to think about how these islands formed in the first place.

115
00:07:44,700 --> 00:07:47,700
We're not talking here about continental islands

116
00:07:47,700 --> 00:07:49,700
which are off-lying peaks separated from the mainland

117
00:07:49,700 --> 00:07:53,200
by rising sea levels at the end of the last ice age.

118
00:07:53,200 --> 00:07:56,700
True oceanic islands were created by volcanic activity

119
00:07:56,700 --> 00:07:58,700
in the middle of oceanic plates.

120
00:07:59,200 --> 00:08:03,200
But if many of these volcanoes eroded and disappeared millions of years ago

121
00:08:03,200 --> 00:08:05,200
why are the islands still here?

122
00:08:05,200 --> 00:08:10,200
The answer is that the coral fringe around them is alive and growing.

123
00:08:10,200 --> 00:08:14,200
Dead coral, either broken off by wave action or marine organisms,

124
00:08:14,200 --> 00:08:18,200
builds up to form an island and it's still building these islands today.

125
00:08:18,200 --> 00:08:20,200
This isn't exactly news.

126
00:08:20,200 --> 00:08:23,200
The process was first postulated by Charles Darwin

127
00:08:23,200 --> 00:08:26,200
and a number of papers have been published over the decades

128
00:08:26,700 --> 00:08:29,700
documenting the continuing growth of these islands.

129
00:08:29,700 --> 00:08:32,700
Although research continues, there's as yet little evidence

130
00:08:32,700 --> 00:08:36,700
that the expected rate of sea level rise will reverse that.

131
00:08:36,700 --> 00:08:39,700
In 2010, Arthur Webb and Paul Kench

132
00:08:39,700 --> 00:08:42,700
analysed hundreds of historical aerial photographs

133
00:08:42,700 --> 00:08:46,200
and confirmed that 23 out of 27 Pacific atolls

134
00:08:46,200 --> 00:08:51,700
are indeed either stable or growing in size, including Tuvalu.

135
00:08:51,700 --> 00:08:55,700
So why do climate scientists insist that these islands face problems?

136
00:08:56,200 --> 00:09:00,200
Well, the problems are related to other issues caused by climate change

137
00:09:00,200 --> 00:09:04,200
such as storm surges, coastal erosion and saline intrusion

138
00:09:04,200 --> 00:09:07,200
not total submergence from rising seas.

139
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:09,200
But of course, the stability of the islands

140
00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:12,200
depends on the continuing health of the coral reefs

141
00:09:12,200 --> 00:09:14,200
which brings us on to this.

142
00:09:14,200 --> 00:09:17,200
What happens is that the tropical waters where they live

143
00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:19,200
are getting too warm

144
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:22,200
and when they get warm, the corals actually purge.

145
00:09:22,200 --> 00:09:25,200
They literally blow out the zooxanthellae

146
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:29,700
and when that happens, they go from vibrant purples, greens and reds

147
00:09:29,700 --> 00:09:32,700
to sort of dull oranges and whites.

148
00:09:32,700 --> 00:09:35,700
The corals actually die.

149
00:09:35,700 --> 00:09:37,700
The real story of coral and global warming

150
00:09:37,700 --> 00:09:40,700
is a bit like the game of good news, bad news.

151
00:09:40,700 --> 00:09:43,700
And the bad news, of course, is that there's no doubt

152
00:09:43,700 --> 00:09:46,700
that warmer waters can damage coral.

153
00:09:46,700 --> 00:09:50,200
Coral survive by forming a symbiotic relationship with algae

154
00:09:50,200 --> 00:09:51,700
which feed them.

155
00:09:51,700 --> 00:09:55,200
When average water temperatures increase by around 1°C

156
00:09:55,200 --> 00:09:58,200
the algae become unproductive and are expelled.

157
00:09:58,200 --> 00:10:01,200
This leaves the coral looking white and dead

158
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:03,200
a process known as bleaching.

159
00:10:03,200 --> 00:10:05,200
But it doesn't mean the coral is dead

160
00:10:05,200 --> 00:10:08,200
it can recover as temperatures cool again.

161
00:10:08,200 --> 00:10:10,200
Well, that's the good news.

162
00:10:10,200 --> 00:10:13,200
The bad news is that several years of above average temperatures

163
00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:15,200
make this bleaching permanent

164
00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:17,200
and this has happened in parts of the Indian Ocean.

165
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:20,200
Is there anything the coral can do to adapt?

166
00:10:20,200 --> 00:10:22,700
Well, one possibility is that they can change

167
00:10:22,700 --> 00:10:24,700
the type of algae they cohabit with

168
00:10:24,700 --> 00:10:27,700
to a type that will survive higher temperatures.

169
00:10:27,700 --> 00:10:31,700
In 2006, a study found that very few coral species can do this

170
00:10:31,700 --> 00:10:34,700
but the methodology and the data used to get this result

171
00:10:34,700 --> 00:10:37,700
were questioned the following year by two other researchers.

172
00:10:37,700 --> 00:10:40,200
They concluded that a lot of coral species

173
00:10:40,200 --> 00:10:42,700
could change the type of algae they employ

174
00:10:42,700 --> 00:10:45,700
so if they're right, we can chalk that up to good news.

175
00:10:45,700 --> 00:10:49,700
Even if coral do successfully switch to more heat tolerant algae

176
00:10:50,200 --> 00:10:53,200
known as Type D, these can only survive temperatures

177
00:10:53,200 --> 00:10:55,200
up to one and a half degrees higher.

178
00:10:55,200 --> 00:10:58,200
If water temperatures go any higher than that

179
00:10:58,200 --> 00:11:01,200
researchers say no suitable algae can survive.

180
00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:02,200
Good news?

181
00:11:02,200 --> 00:11:05,200
Well, coral may indeed die out where they stand today

182
00:11:05,200 --> 00:11:08,200
but they could grow instead in higher latitudes.

183
00:11:08,200 --> 00:11:09,200
What's the evidence?

184
00:11:09,200 --> 00:11:11,200
Well, about 6,000 years ago

185
00:11:11,200 --> 00:11:15,200
the sea around Tokyo was 1.2 to 1.7 degrees warmer

186
00:11:15,200 --> 00:11:18,200
than it is today and coral flourished.

187
00:11:18,200 --> 00:11:22,200
The bad news is that that success might not be replicated in the future.

188
00:11:22,200 --> 00:11:24,200
According to a report by the Pew Center

189
00:11:24,200 --> 00:11:27,700
human activity in many coastal areas is now intense

190
00:11:27,700 --> 00:11:31,700
and pollution and other factors may prevent coral from easily forming.

191
00:11:31,700 --> 00:11:33,700
But there's an even bigger reason

192
00:11:33,700 --> 00:11:36,700
the fact that nullifies a lot of the good news about coral

193
00:11:36,700 --> 00:11:39,700
it might be able to cope with the temperature of the water

194
00:11:39,700 --> 00:11:43,200
what it may not be able to fight is rising acidity

195
00:11:43,200 --> 00:11:45,700
as increasing carbon dioxide in the atmosphere

196
00:11:46,700 --> 00:11:48,200
to form carbonic acid

197
00:11:48,200 --> 00:11:53,200
and acid eats away the calcite shells in marine organisms including coral.

198
00:11:53,200 --> 00:11:55,700
But a study from Stanford University

199
00:11:55,700 --> 00:11:58,200
found that corals will only be affected

200
00:11:58,200 --> 00:12:01,700
when carbon dioxide levels reach 550 ppm

201
00:12:01,700 --> 00:12:04,700
that's expected to happen in 2050.

202
00:12:04,700 --> 00:12:07,700
Carbon dioxide dissolves better in colder water

203
00:12:07,700 --> 00:12:10,700
so cold oceans are feeling the effects first.

204
00:12:10,700 --> 00:12:13,200
I'll look at that in a later video.

205
00:12:13,200 --> 00:12:14,700
To be honest, on the whole

206
00:12:14,700 --> 00:12:17,700
most media don't do a bad job in reporting the science

207
00:12:17,700 --> 00:12:20,700
sometimes they do get it wrong quite spectacularly

208
00:12:20,700 --> 00:12:24,200
often newspaper headlines and two-minute TV news stories

209
00:12:24,200 --> 00:12:26,700
don't have room to report the complexities

210
00:12:26,700 --> 00:12:28,700
reflected in the science journals.

211
00:12:28,700 --> 00:12:32,700
The problem is, critics confuse these headlines with real science

212
00:12:32,700 --> 00:12:35,700
so when inaccurate and hyped stories in the media

213
00:12:35,700 --> 00:12:37,200
are shown to be wrong

214
00:12:37,200 --> 00:12:39,700
it's assumed that the science was wrong.

215
00:12:39,700 --> 00:12:42,700
Anyone who's watched my video series from the beginning

216
00:12:42,700 --> 00:12:45,200
knows it's a familiar pattern.
