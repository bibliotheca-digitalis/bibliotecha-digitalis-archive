0	4840	I was going to make this video about the timeline of the coronavirus outbreak in China, and
4840	11000	as part of that I tracked down an internet rumour that the virus started in a Wuhan lab.
11000	15640	But that rumour has suddenly become front page news, so I'll cut the video short and
15640	19000	just focus on that. I'll leave the rest for another day.
19000	24720	There is a growing belief that the Covid-19 virus originated in the Wuhan lab.
24720	29760	An intern was infected, who later infected her boyfriend, and then went to the wet market
29760	35080	in Wuhan, where it began to spread. So who is this female intern working in a
35080	40000	Wuhan lab, who got infected? Before all this blew up in the mainstream
40000	45360	media, weeks ago I was already following it up, prompted by a post on the forum of my
45360	50360	last video. They knew as early as October 18th 2019 that
50360	56680	this virus had leaked, and that's the day it leaked out of the Wuhan Level 4 biolab.
56720	61680	Unfortunately the poster didn't give a source, but other believers in the lab leak claim
61680	65320	do. First that, a scholar from the South China
65320	69000	University of Technology recently published a paper.
69000	73720	Actually it wasn't so much a published paper as something he wrote and shared on a science
73720	79200	forum. It was posted on 23 different websites around the world and then spread around the
79200	83840	blogosphere. The author's name is Xiao Butao.
83840	88000	But this commentator got his information from a video called I found the source of
88000	95600	the coronavirus by a YouTuber called Laowai86, and I tracked a lot of the Wuhan lab escape
95600	100800	rumours back to the same video, which got over 2 million hits.
100800	107560	Now spoiler alert, Laowai86, real name Matthew Tai, hasn't actually found the source of
107560	112400	the coronavirus. But he does outline a theory that's been bouncing around the Chinese
112400	118280	blogosphere for weeks, and he gives a very comprehensive account of all the evidence.
118280	122080	I'll pick out the bits of his video that give the gist of the story.
122080	127440	Xiao Butao, he was a professor, he posted a thesis. The professor directly pointed out
127440	132760	that the main source of the virus is from the Wuhan lab, which is only 300, or actually
132760	137860	280 metres to be exact, from the Huanan seafood market. He also gives a clear timeline and
137860	142620	has information that researchers were splashed with urine and blood samples from all the
142620	148540	bats that were collected. People working in the lab claim to have been splashed with coronavirus
148540	154060	containing vials. Huang Yanling was a researcher in the lab working on the virology of bats
154060	160260	with Shi Zhengli, and she's missing. Most people believe her to be patient zero, and
160260	165500	most people believe she's dead, and her online presence has been scrubbed from existence,
165500	171420	all happening in a lab 280m away from the Huanan seafood market. The December 24th posting
171420	175460	acknowledges that they've made a big discovery in human transmissibility, and they need more
175460	176580	help to deal with it.
176580	182340	I hope you all followed that. If not, here's a summary of the theory. It all sounds very
182340	187740	well researched and very convincing. But of course it needs to be fact checked, and the
187740	193480	way we do that is to ask two basic questions. What's the evidence, and what are the sources
193480	199520	for this evidence? There are three main lines, starting with the aforementioned Xiao Butao.
199520	202320	He knew researchers at the lab that were infected.
202320	207040	Correction, he didn't know any researchers at the lab. This is where it pays to check
207040	213120	by reading the source, Xiao Butao's internet post, which I'm showing you on the screen.
213120	219160	He didn't even know the lab. He said he discovered the two labs in Wuhan, not one, by doing a
219160	224720	search on the internet. One is the Wuhan Centre for Disease Control and Prevention,
224720	230960	just 280m from the Wuhan seafood market, where the virus was thought to have spread. The
230960	236440	other is the Wuhan Institute of Virology, about 12km away.
236440	241080	The professor directly pointed out that the main source of the virus is from the Wuhan
241080	242080	lab.
242080	243240	OK, but which one?
243240	248320	Which is only 300, or actually 280m to be exact, from the Huanan seafood market.
248320	253440	Ah, so Matthew Tai is referring to the Wuhan Centre for Disease Control and Prevention,
253440	260240	which we'll call the Wuhan CDC. That's the one 280m from the Wuhan seafood market, and
260240	262240	the one he shows on the map.
262240	266760	He also gives a clear timeline and has information that researchers were splashed with urine
266760	269920	and blood samples from all the bats that were collected.
269920	276080	No, Xiao Butao says one researcher, with the initials JHT, was splashed with bat blood
276080	281720	and urine, on different occasions, while he was collecting samples in caves nowhere
281720	287640	near the Wuhan CDC, which is the institute he worked for. The timeline is not clear,
287640	293000	but as we'll see from Xiao Butao's 2017 source, this happened several years before
293000	295400	the novel coronavirus outbreak.
295400	299200	And they had already begun self-quarantine after they showed symptoms of being infected?
299200	304620	No, again, there's no they. This was one person, far from the lab, and he showed no
304620	310100	symptoms of being infected. All this is spelled out in Xiao Butao's post, which Matthew
310100	313180	Tai is supposed to be quoting.
313180	317920	But I hear you say it says on Matthew Tai's screen that the researchers at the Wuhan virus
317920	323160	laboratory were splashed with bat blood and urine. It says so right there.
323160	328060	But what Matthew Tai's video is showing you on the screen, for some reason, is not
328060	334140	Xiao Butao's post, but a translated report from Radio France Internationale. It comes
334140	340420	from their Hong Kong correspondent, and as we'll see, it's ridiculously inaccurate.
340420	344820	The professor directly pointed out that the main source of the virus is from the Wuhan
344820	345820	lab.
345820	353080	No, Xiao doesn't say that at all. He only says it's possible, and plausible, and probable.
353080	356900	These are three different things, so take your pick. But nowhere does it say that the
356900	363160	main source of the virus was the Wuhan CDC or any other research facility.
363180	367460	But that's what Matthew Tai and his followers now believe, so let's figure out how this
367460	372400	story got so terribly mangled and embellished in its many retellings.
372400	378820	Xiao Butao's information about researcher JHT and the bat blood and bat pee comes, he
378820	383760	tells us, from a couple of media reports. He only gives an English translation of the
383760	390600	titles, the first of which is by a reporter called Tao, initial P. Based on that, I tracked
390600	396400	down an article with a similar title in Chinese by a reporter called Tao Pan, featuring a
396400	402400	bat researcher called Tian Junhua. If his family name is placed last, as in Western
402400	408940	tradition, that gives the initials JHT. The story tells of how on different occasions
408940	413960	blood and on one occasion urine had splashed on him while he was out collecting bats in
413960	420440	the wild, and that he had isolated himself for 14 days because of the risk of infection.
420440	426960	However, the article makes clear he was never infected. The timeline for these incidents
426960	435720	is after 2012 when he started collecting bats and before 2017 when the article was published.
435720	442600	This is the researcher in question, Tian Junhua, filmed for a documentary about his research.
442600	447840	And Xiao Butao seems to have accurately relayed what Tao Pan reported, just leaving out the
447840	453760	dates. The Radio France Internationale reporter then seems to have mangled these different
453760	460240	elements of Xiao Butao's post and embellished them. He turns a single researcher into several,
460240	465620	he merges the separate incidents of bat blood and bat urine into a single incident, and
465620	470200	then he moves the scene of the action from the caves of Hubei province into something
470200	475800	called the Wuhan Virology Lab. But there's no such place, of course. He's conflated
475800	482080	two separate institutes into one. Matthew Tai then adds an embellishment of his own.
482080	488760	Instead of these non-existent lab workers not being infected, he claims they were infected.
488760	493480	As I said, over two million people have seen this video, and of course lots of bloggers
493480	498640	and commentators have copied Matthew Tai's version of Radio France's version of Xiao
498640	502440	Butao's version of Tao Pan's version of the story.
502440	506320	OK, so let's look at Matthew Tai's second piece of evidence.
506320	510400	During my research, a name kept popping up. Huang Yanling.
510400	516600	If research means simply googling keywords like Wuhan, bat, and patient zero, and reading
516600	521640	blogs, chat rooms, Twitter, and its Chinese equivalent Weibo, then it's not surprising
521640	526840	that Huang Yanling's name keeps popping up, because she's been the focus of a conspiracy
526840	531140	theory circulated in China since early February.
531140	534720	So who is she? Huang Yanling was a researcher in the lab
534720	537240	working on the virology of bats with Shizheng Li.
537240	543040	Well, she wasn't any of those things. First of all, Matthew Tai told us that the lab he's
543040	550280	referring to is the Wuhan CDC, 280 metres from the seafood market. But Huang Yanling
550280	555600	didn't work there. She worked at the Wuhan Institute of Virology, which is 12 kilometres
555600	561840	away on the other side of the Yangtze River. And she didn't work on the virology of bats.
561840	566360	All of her published research is involved with finding a cure for the bacterial infections
566360	572680	streptococcus and methylen-resistant Staphylococcus aureus. She was investigating the pathway
572680	578740	by which these bacteria could be destroyed by viruses, nothing to do with bats at all.
578740	583640	And she's missing. Most people believe her to be patient zero, and most people believe
583640	586040	she's dead. Well, certainly a lot of people copying and
586040	592380	pasting this rumour believe that. But popular belief isn't evidence. So what started all
592380	596320	these rumours? Well, in February, when the virus outbreak
596320	601960	was at its peak in China, someone went onto the website of the Wuhan Institute of Virology
601960	607380	and noticed that there was no photo or bio of one of its ex-students.
607380	612400	This is China, where questions tend to be quickly followed by conjecture. Where's the
612400	617160	photo? If there's no photo, then she must be missing. And if she's missing, she must
617160	621940	be dead. And if she's dead, she must have been involved in bat research and died from
621940	626880	the new coronavirus. And if she caught the new coronavirus, then she must be patient
626880	630240	zero. The story spread across China and was then
630240	635540	popularised in the West by Matthew Tai. Most believe that her body was quickly cremated
635540	638760	and the people working at the crematorium were perhaps infected.
638760	644280	Now that could be true. It is possible most people who are copying and pasting this rumour
644280	649640	do believe her body was cremated and that the cremation crew got infected. Others believe
649640	655920	she spread it through her boyfriend. But again, popular belief is not evidence.
655920	660320	The most convincing evidence that she might be missing is that the government hasn't dispelled
660320	665920	these rumours by finding her. But the sad fact is that people go missing all the time
665920	672720	in China and it's not because they all contracted COVID-19. We're dealing with a country that
672720	678840	practises arbitrary arrest and where the slightest criticism of the government can lead to arrest
678840	684520	or detention or even imprisonment. It can lead to being fired from your job and relocated,
684520	688120	effectively banished, to another part of the country.
688120	693440	And if Huang Yanling is truly alive like they claim, why is her photo and bio removed?
693480	699320	I honestly have no idea, Matthew. And what would be the point in doing that anyway, especially
699320	705040	if her name and her graduation details are still there? She may be missing. She may not
705040	710200	be missing. She may have got run over by a bus. She could be one of many people detained
710200	715460	in China for political reasons. She could be living happily in Chengdu and doesn't particularly
715460	722220	want all this attention. I don't know. You don't know and the millions of people speculating
722220	727820	about this don't know either. We can't just jump to the conclusion that she must be patient
727820	733920	zero because YouTubers, bloggers and chatroom posters believe it. Matthew Tai's third line
733920	739260	of evidence is a job posting on the Wuhan Institute of Virology website. I'll let him
739260	744240	tell you what it says, then I'll show you what it really says.
744240	748640	Which basically says, we've discovered a new and terrible virus and would like to recruit
748640	752780	people to come deal with it. The December 24th posting acknowledges that they've made
752780	756780	a big discovery in human transmissibility and they need more help to deal with it.
756780	761740	OK, so it doesn't say any of that. Matthew is showing you a translation of only part
761740	767640	of the text he showed in Chinese. He's left all this out. And this missing translation
767640	773060	is the part that supposedly says the team has discovered a terrible new virus. In fact,
773060	778500	it doesn't say that at all. It says the team is engaged in long term research that's been
778500	784120	published in 110 papers and has identified a large number of new viruses in bats and
784120	790000	rodents. So these new viruses haven't just been discovered. The term is referring to
790000	796460	discoveries made over the last 10 years, and none of them is described as terrible.
796460	801500	Research into bats as carriers of coronavirus is taking place all over the world, from South
801500	808880	Africa to Germany, Kenya, Saudi Arabia, Mexico and of course the United States. Why? Because
808880	814780	these bats are known to be the source of coronavirus infection. And all these research institutes
814780	820720	also advertise for researchers. You don't need to take my word for all this. I put all
820720	826540	of these sources and links in the video description so you can check them. The theory that a female
826540	832700	intern at a Wuhan lab got infected and then spread the virus is not new. It goes back
832700	839000	several months. But its origins are unsubstantiated rumours on the Chinese language internet embellished
839000	845120	by bloggers, vloggers and news outlets on the English language internet, based on misreadings,
845120	851740	mix-ups and mistranslations. That's why everyone, especially mainstream media reporters, need
851740	854860	to fact-check this stuff before believing it.
854860	861420	But the idea that the virus leaped from a lab is just too good a story to let go. So
861420	866380	bloggers and journalists are conjuring up all kinds of new evidence. Like a photo taken
866380	872860	supposedly recently inside the secretive Wuhan Institute of Virology, supposedly showing
872860	880180	a broken seal on a fridge containing the SARS-CoV-2 virus. In fact, it was taken two years ago
880180	885660	and posted on the Wuhan Institute of Virology's own website, and it's still there, along
885660	891180	with other photos that the newspapers missed. So there were no SARS-CoV-2 virus samples
891180	896340	in the freezer, and all the virus samples that were there are held in sealed containers
896340	899380	frozen to minus 23 degrees centigrade.
899380	902180	OK, how about this?
902180	907420	So when she heard about the outbreak of the new virus, she was worried that it could have
907420	911620	come from her lab. She spoke about the sleepless nights she suffered worrying whether it was
911620	914060	her lab that was responsible for the outbreak.
914060	918340	Which is understandable. After all, it's possible someone might have come into contact
918340	924100	with bat samples and not noticed. According to the Washington Post, officials from the
924100	930180	US Embassy in Beijing visited the Wuhan Institute of Virology a few years ago and were concerned
930180	936340	about safety standards there. According to the Post, the Chinese researchers at WIV were
936340	942020	receiving assistance from the Galveston National Laboratory, but the Chinese requested additional
942020	947340	help. The cables argued that the United States should give the Wuhan lab further support,
947340	953700	mainly because its research on bat coronaviruses was important but also dangerous.
953700	959700	But after gene sequencing, it turned out that the new virus was not among the viruses collected
959700	965420	from samples taken in the wild. So is it possible it came from a virus the lab possessed that
965420	971500	was similar? That's the claim of a tabloid newspaper now being read out by this YouTuber.
971500	977540	One of the virus samples she had in the laboratory had a 96% genetic match to Covid-19.
977540	984980	What they mean is that it had a 96% genetic match to SARS-CoV-2. Covid-19 is the disease,
984980	992180	not the virus. The newspaper is referring to RATG13, a naturally occurring virus that
992180	999420	the researchers sampled from a bat in Yunnan province. But 96% doesn't make this the same
999420	1007260	virus. After all, we humans share 96% of our DNA with chimpanzees. One research team may
1007260	1013940	have found a much better match, 99%, with a virus found in pangolins. But I can't cite
1013940	1018100	that definitively because the research hasn't been published yet.
1018100	1022860	Another popular theory is that the virus was deliberately bio-engineered in an effort
1022860	1028380	to study bat viruses and then accidentally escape from the lab. The favourite piece of
1028380	1034460	evidence for this theory is, supposedly, a 2017 article in Nature.
1034460	1041580	Researchers created a chimeric virus made up of surface protein SHC-014 and the backbone
1041580	1046180	of a SARS virus that had been adapted to grow mice and to mimic human disease. Kill them.
1046180	1049900	You'll notice the March Editor's Note on this because this appears to be obviously
1049900	1055260	related to the question of, was this created in a lab? They say, we are aware this story
1055260	1059500	is being used as a basis for unverified theories that the novel coronavirus causing Covid-19
1059500	1063200	was engineered. There's no evidence that this is true. Scientists believe that an animal
1063200	1066980	is the most likely source of the coronavirus. Well, ultimately, that would still be the
1066980	1069740	same, even if it was engineered, would it not?
1069740	1074800	No, it would not. Making assumptions like this based on a failure to understand the
1074800	1080340	difference between a lab-made virus and one that comes from an animal is exactly why Nature
1080340	1086060	warned you not to use the paper as the basis for unverified theories. And after reading
1086060	1091960	that warning out loud, you come straight out with an unverified theory.
1091960	1097540	Natural viruses and lab-engineered viruses are completely different. Because when researchers
1097540	1102880	are bio-engineering a virus, they usually don't build the entire thing from scratch.
1102960	1107920	What they're interested in is the business end of the virus, called the spike proteins.
1107920	1113260	They house the receptor binding domain, the RBD, where the virus attaches itself to the
1113260	1119320	host cell and the cleavage sites, where it breaks in and enters the cell.
1119320	1124200	So except in exceptional circumstances, they build the spike proteins onto the structure
1124200	1130600	of an existing infectious virus. I suppose the best analogy is graffiti artists. They
1130600	1135760	usually don't spend lots of time and money building an entire wall from scratch in order
1135760	1141320	to spray paint their art. They find an existing wall and use that.
1141320	1146440	When researchers at the Scripps Institute examined the genetic make-up of the new coronavirus,
1146440	1151520	they discovered that the whole thing was new. Not only that, there was clear evidence that
1151520	1156800	the virus had evolved. It had genetic sequences that could only be obtained in the presence
1156800	1162140	of a complete immune system. Battle scars, if you like, showing that it had been forced
1162140	1168800	to evolve by adapting and trying to overcome immune responses. You don't get that by artificially
1168800	1172620	growing a virus in the presence of isolated cells.
1172620	1176880	The Scripps Institute researchers published their findings in Nature Medicine, with the
1176880	1182840	clear conclusion that it wasn't a laboratory construct. One of the researchers told Science
1182840	1188280	Daily these two features of the virus, the mutations in the RBD portion of the spike
1188280	1195040	protein and its distinct backbone, rules out laboratory manipulation as a potential origin
1195040	1200380	for SARS-CoV-2. The fact that this virus wasn't engineered
1200380	1205560	rules out another rumour in the English-language blogosphere that it was a bioweapon developed
1205560	1211100	by the Chinese, and the rumour on the Chinese blogosphere that it was bioengineered by the
1211100	1216080	US Army. Analysis of the virus has ruled that out.
1216080	1220920	The Australian tabloid this YouTuber and many others are copying from claims it got all
1220920	1226500	its information from a leaked dossier compiled by governments, but it won't show it or
1226500	1232580	tell us who wrote it. A secret leaked dossier does sound more reliable than bloggers, YouTubers
1232580	1237580	and tabloid newspapers, but it doesn't contain a single piece of information that couldn't
1237580	1241400	have been found on the internet with a simple Google search.
1241400	1247780	The information about a 96% match, for example, comes from a Nature paper by Chinese researchers
1247780	1253060	including Xi Jinping, published in February. The fact that the authors of the supposed
1253060	1259380	dossier thought Covid-19 as a virus says a lot about their expertise and the extent of
1259380	1263740	their research. And the information about a chimeric virus
1263740	1269700	built in a laboratory is hardly secret, it comes from this February paper in Nature.
1269700	1273900	The quotes about Xi Zhengli worrying that the virus might have come from her laboratory
1273900	1280180	were published in April in Scientific American etc etc. No need for the telegraph to invoke
1280180	1285460	a leaked dossier, all this could have been just as easily written by an intern trawling
1285460	1291540	through the internet and copying and pasting publicly available information.
1291540	1296100	But as researcher Peter Darshak says, let's look at the balance of probability, that's
1296100	1299020	what you have to do. That's because there's another laboratory
1299020	1304340	in China which is a much more likely source of the infection. Unlike the Wuhan Institute
1304340	1310680	of Virology or the Wuhan CDC, which have just a few researchers handling bat samples using
1310680	1316740	safety equipment and protocols, this secretive laboratory outside Wuhan employs thousands
1316740	1322660	of researchers, it's never been inspected by anyone outside of China and yet it has
1322660	1327940	a much lower level of biosecurity than both of the other labs. Safety equipment here is
1327940	1333140	completely absent and there have been numerous cases of researchers coming into contact with
1333140	1338460	bat blood and bat urine. I'm sure you'd agree that this laboratory is a much more likely
1338460	1342980	source of infection. Now that I've got the attention of the lab
1342980	1348640	leak believers, the place I'm talking about isn't actually a laboratory. It's the countryside
1348640	1353520	and the researchers are actually just Chinese farmers and villagers who venture into the
1353520	1359540	woods and caves around Wuhan, trapping bats for food and digging bat guano for fertiliser.
1359540	1364240	People live out in rural areas close to bat caves. They're exposed every night when bats
1364240	1369660	fly over them, urinate, defecate, maybe onto their food or into their drink. And people
1369660	1373900	go into bat caves, people go in for various reasons. They're going to dig out the bat
1373900	1379120	guano, the faeces, and they use it as a fertiliser, just like we used to do many years ago with
1379120	1386380	bird faeces. They go into caves to shelter from the rain. They're farmers, they're subsistence
1386380	1391300	farmers hunting and eating wildlife, so they get exposed that way.
1391300	1396740	Even tourists visit caves crowded with bats and infested with bat urine and faeces. So
1396740	1401700	if the virus made the direct jump from bats to humans, these places where thousands of
1401700	1407140	unprotected people come into contact with bats and don't isolate themselves are a much
1407140	1414180	more likely source of infection. So why don't tabloid newspapers write stories about this?
1414180	1419980	For the same reason I had to call it a laboratory to get people's attention. Secret labs full
1419980	1425900	of reckless scientists and dangerous experiments releasing deadly viruses make headlines and
1425900	1431940	sell newspapers, peasant farmers collecting batshit in caves. Well, you can see why people
1431940	1437580	prefer the lab story. But all that assumes the virus jumped from bats directly to humans
1437580	1442900	in the first place. Although bats are probably the reservoir for the virus, most researchers
1442900	1449060	don't think they passed it directly on to humans. According to DNA analysis, SARS-CoV-2
1449060	1454080	first evolved around 50 years ago in bats, and then most likely spread to humans through
1454080	1460960	an intermediate species. That was how previous viruses have spread, SARS through civets and
1460960	1467360	MERS through camels. A likely pathway for SARS-CoV-2 was through pangolins. It's the
1467360	1472840	world's most trafficked mammal, highly prized in China for food as well as having its scales
1472840	1478720	used for traditional medicine. As I mentioned earlier, one so far unpublished study found
1478720	1486400	a virus in pangolins that shared 99% of its DNA with SARS-CoV-2. So what has the Wuhan
1486400	1491800	seafood market got to do with all this? Well, very early on it was clear that many patients
1491800	1497920	coming into Wuhan hospitals with pneumonia-like conditions had a connection to the market.
1497920	1503840	A paper in The Lancet, a British medical journal, confirmed this. It's possible it came to the
1503840	1508440	market from outside and spread there simply because it's the kind of place where crowds
1508480	1514760	of people come together, but it's also possible the virus started there. Not by bats, which
1514760	1520840	weren't sold at the market, but through other animals sold there. Epidemiologists and virologists
1520840	1526160	have been warning for years that these wild animal sales, where exotic species are brought
1526160	1532560	together, often alive in closely packed cages, are a breeding ground for new viruses. They've
1532560	1537760	been calling for the Chinese government to shut them down and stamp out the trade. That's
1537760	1542200	where the attention needs to be focused, and that's why the Chinese government needs to
1542200	1547640	be held accountable. It's always easier to blame scientists because that makes for a
1547640	1553480	better story and a more juicy conspiracy. Most people don't understand science, and
1553480	1557760	they don't read any of the published research that comes from these institutes, so it's
1557760	1563240	easy to convince them that these places are secretive and mysterious. It not only sells
1563240	1565360	newspapers, it sells t-shirts.
