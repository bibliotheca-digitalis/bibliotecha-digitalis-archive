1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,840
I was going to make this video about the timeline of the coronavirus outbreak in China, and

2
00:00:04,840 --> 00:00:11,000
as part of that I tracked down an internet rumour that the virus started in a Wuhan lab.

3
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:15,640
But that rumour has suddenly become front page news, so I'll cut the video short and

4
00:00:15,640 --> 00:00:19,000
just focus on that. I'll leave the rest for another day.

5
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:24,720
There is a growing belief that the Covid-19 virus originated in the Wuhan lab.

6
00:00:24,720 --> 00:00:29,760
An intern was infected, who later infected her boyfriend, and then went to the wet market

7
00:00:29,760 --> 00:00:35,080
in Wuhan, where it began to spread. So who is this female intern working in a

8
00:00:35,080 --> 00:00:40,000
Wuhan lab, who got infected? Before all this blew up in the mainstream

9
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:45,360
media, weeks ago I was already following it up, prompted by a post on the forum of my

10
00:00:45,360 --> 00:00:50,360
last video. They knew as early as October 18th 2019 that

11
00:00:50,360 --> 00:00:56,680
this virus had leaked, and that's the day it leaked out of the Wuhan Level 4 biolab.

12
00:00:56,720 --> 00:01:01,680
Unfortunately the poster didn't give a source, but other believers in the lab leak claim

13
00:01:01,680 --> 00:01:05,320
do. First that, a scholar from the South China

14
00:01:05,320 --> 00:01:09,000
University of Technology recently published a paper.

15
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:13,720
Actually it wasn't so much a published paper as something he wrote and shared on a science

16
00:01:13,720 --> 00:01:19,200
forum. It was posted on 23 different websites around the world and then spread around the

17
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:23,840
blogosphere. The author's name is Xiao Butao.

18
00:01:23,840 --> 00:01:28,000
But this commentator got his information from a video called I found the source of

19
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:35,600
the coronavirus by a YouTuber called Laowai86, and I tracked a lot of the Wuhan lab escape

20
00:01:35,600 --> 00:01:40,800
rumours back to the same video, which got over 2 million hits.

21
00:01:40,800 --> 00:01:47,560
Now spoiler alert, Laowai86, real name Matthew Tai, hasn't actually found the source of

22
00:01:47,560 --> 00:01:52,400
the coronavirus. But he does outline a theory that's been bouncing around the Chinese

23
00:01:52,400 --> 00:01:58,280
blogosphere for weeks, and he gives a very comprehensive account of all the evidence.

24
00:01:58,280 --> 00:02:02,080
I'll pick out the bits of his video that give the gist of the story.

25
00:02:02,080 --> 00:02:07,440
Xiao Butao, he was a professor, he posted a thesis. The professor directly pointed out

26
00:02:07,440 --> 00:02:12,760
that the main source of the virus is from the Wuhan lab, which is only 300, or actually

27
00:02:12,760 --> 00:02:17,860
280 metres to be exact, from the Huanan seafood market. He also gives a clear timeline and

28
00:02:17,860 --> 00:02:22,620
has information that researchers were splashed with urine and blood samples from all the

29
00:02:22,620 --> 00:02:28,540
bats that were collected. People working in the lab claim to have been splashed with coronavirus

30
00:02:28,540 --> 00:02:34,060
containing vials. Huang Yanling was a researcher in the lab working on the virology of bats

31
00:02:34,060 --> 00:02:40,260
with Shi Zhengli, and she's missing. Most people believe her to be patient zero, and

32
00:02:40,260 --> 00:02:45,500
most people believe she's dead, and her online presence has been scrubbed from existence,

33
00:02:45,500 --> 00:02:51,420
all happening in a lab 280m away from the Huanan seafood market. The December 24th posting

34
00:02:51,420 --> 00:02:55,460
acknowledges that they've made a big discovery in human transmissibility, and they need more

35
00:02:55,460 --> 00:02:56,580
help to deal with it.

36
00:02:56,580 --> 00:03:02,340
I hope you all followed that. If not, here's a summary of the theory. It all sounds very

37
00:03:02,340 --> 00:03:07,740
well researched and very convincing. But of course it needs to be fact checked, and the

38
00:03:07,740 --> 00:03:13,480
way we do that is to ask two basic questions. What's the evidence, and what are the sources

39
00:03:13,480 --> 00:03:19,520
for this evidence? There are three main lines, starting with the aforementioned Xiao Butao.

40
00:03:19,520 --> 00:03:22,320
He knew researchers at the lab that were infected.

41
00:03:22,320 --> 00:03:27,040
Correction, he didn't know any researchers at the lab. This is where it pays to check

42
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:33,120
by reading the source, Xiao Butao's internet post, which I'm showing you on the screen.

43
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:39,160
He didn't even know the lab. He said he discovered the two labs in Wuhan, not one, by doing a

44
00:03:39,160 --> 00:03:44,720
search on the internet. One is the Wuhan Centre for Disease Control and Prevention,

45
00:03:44,720 --> 00:03:50,960
just 280m from the Wuhan seafood market, where the virus was thought to have spread. The

46
00:03:50,960 --> 00:03:56,440
other is the Wuhan Institute of Virology, about 12km away.

47
00:03:56,440 --> 00:04:01,080
The professor directly pointed out that the main source of the virus is from the Wuhan

48
00:04:01,080 --> 00:04:02,080
lab.

49
00:04:02,080 --> 00:04:03,240
OK, but which one?

50
00:04:03,240 --> 00:04:08,320
Which is only 300, or actually 280m to be exact, from the Huanan seafood market.

51
00:04:08,320 --> 00:04:13,440
Ah, so Matthew Tai is referring to the Wuhan Centre for Disease Control and Prevention,

52
00:04:13,440 --> 00:04:20,240
which we'll call the Wuhan CDC. That's the one 280m from the Wuhan seafood market, and

53
00:04:20,240 --> 00:04:22,240
the one he shows on the map.

54
00:04:22,240 --> 00:04:26,760
He also gives a clear timeline and has information that researchers were splashed with urine

55
00:04:26,760 --> 00:04:29,920
and blood samples from all the bats that were collected.

56
00:04:29,920 --> 00:04:36,080
No, Xiao Butao says one researcher, with the initials JHT, was splashed with bat blood

57
00:04:36,080 --> 00:04:41,720
and urine, on different occasions, while he was collecting samples in caves nowhere

58
00:04:41,720 --> 00:04:47,640
near the Wuhan CDC, which is the institute he worked for. The timeline is not clear,

59
00:04:47,640 --> 00:04:53,000
but as we'll see from Xiao Butao's 2017 source, this happened several years before

60
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:55,400
the novel coronavirus outbreak.

61
00:04:55,400 --> 00:04:59,200
And they had already begun self-quarantine after they showed symptoms of being infected?

62
00:04:59,200 --> 00:05:04,620
No, again, there's no they. This was one person, far from the lab, and he showed no

63
00:05:04,620 --> 00:05:10,100
symptoms of being infected. All this is spelled out in Xiao Butao's post, which Matthew

64
00:05:10,100 --> 00:05:13,180
Tai is supposed to be quoting.

65
00:05:13,180 --> 00:05:17,920
But I hear you say it says on Matthew Tai's screen that the researchers at the Wuhan virus

66
00:05:17,920 --> 00:05:23,160
laboratory were splashed with bat blood and urine. It says so right there.

67
00:05:23,160 --> 00:05:28,060
But what Matthew Tai's video is showing you on the screen, for some reason, is not

68
00:05:28,060 --> 00:05:34,140
Xiao Butao's post, but a translated report from Radio France Internationale. It comes

69
00:05:34,140 --> 00:05:40,420
from their Hong Kong correspondent, and as we'll see, it's ridiculously inaccurate.

70
00:05:40,420 --> 00:05:44,820
The professor directly pointed out that the main source of the virus is from the Wuhan

71
00:05:44,820 --> 00:05:45,820
lab.

72
00:05:45,820 --> 00:05:53,080
No, Xiao doesn't say that at all. He only says it's possible, and plausible, and probable.

73
00:05:53,080 --> 00:05:56,900
These are three different things, so take your pick. But nowhere does it say that the

74
00:05:56,900 --> 00:06:03,160
main source of the virus was the Wuhan CDC or any other research facility.

75
00:06:03,180 --> 00:06:07,460
But that's what Matthew Tai and his followers now believe, so let's figure out how this

76
00:06:07,460 --> 00:06:12,400
story got so terribly mangled and embellished in its many retellings.

77
00:06:12,400 --> 00:06:18,820
Xiao Butao's information about researcher JHT and the bat blood and bat pee comes, he

78
00:06:18,820 --> 00:06:23,760
tells us, from a couple of media reports. He only gives an English translation of the

79
00:06:23,760 --> 00:06:30,600
titles, the first of which is by a reporter called Tao, initial P. Based on that, I tracked

80
00:06:30,600 --> 00:06:36,400
down an article with a similar title in Chinese by a reporter called Tao Pan, featuring a

81
00:06:36,400 --> 00:06:42,400
bat researcher called Tian Junhua. If his family name is placed last, as in Western

82
00:06:42,400 --> 00:06:48,940
tradition, that gives the initials JHT. The story tells of how on different occasions

83
00:06:48,940 --> 00:06:53,960
blood and on one occasion urine had splashed on him while he was out collecting bats in

84
00:06:53,960 --> 00:07:00,440
the wild, and that he had isolated himself for 14 days because of the risk of infection.

85
00:07:00,440 --> 00:07:06,960
However, the article makes clear he was never infected. The timeline for these incidents

86
00:07:06,960 --> 00:07:15,720
is after 2012 when he started collecting bats and before 2017 when the article was published.

87
00:07:15,720 --> 00:07:22,600
This is the researcher in question, Tian Junhua, filmed for a documentary about his research.

88
00:07:22,600 --> 00:07:27,840
And Xiao Butao seems to have accurately relayed what Tao Pan reported, just leaving out the

89
00:07:27,840 --> 00:07:33,760
dates. The Radio France Internationale reporter then seems to have mangled these different

90
00:07:33,760 --> 00:07:40,240
elements of Xiao Butao's post and embellished them. He turns a single researcher into several,

91
00:07:40,240 --> 00:07:45,620
he merges the separate incidents of bat blood and bat urine into a single incident, and

92
00:07:45,620 --> 00:07:50,200
then he moves the scene of the action from the caves of Hubei province into something

93
00:07:50,200 --> 00:07:55,800
called the Wuhan Virology Lab. But there's no such place, of course. He's conflated

94
00:07:55,800 --> 00:08:02,080
two separate institutes into one. Matthew Tai then adds an embellishment of his own.

95
00:08:02,080 --> 00:08:08,760
Instead of these non-existent lab workers not being infected, he claims they were infected.

96
00:08:08,760 --> 00:08:13,480
As I said, over two million people have seen this video, and of course lots of bloggers

97
00:08:13,480 --> 00:08:18,640
and commentators have copied Matthew Tai's version of Radio France's version of Xiao

98
00:08:18,640 --> 00:08:22,440
Butao's version of Tao Pan's version of the story.

99
00:08:22,440 --> 00:08:26,320
OK, so let's look at Matthew Tai's second piece of evidence.

100
00:08:26,320 --> 00:08:30,400
During my research, a name kept popping up. Huang Yanling.

101
00:08:30,400 --> 00:08:36,600
If research means simply googling keywords like Wuhan, bat, and patient zero, and reading

102
00:08:36,600 --> 00:08:41,640
blogs, chat rooms, Twitter, and its Chinese equivalent Weibo, then it's not surprising

103
00:08:41,640 --> 00:08:46,840
that Huang Yanling's name keeps popping up, because she's been the focus of a conspiracy

104
00:08:46,840 --> 00:08:51,140
theory circulated in China since early February.

105
00:08:51,140 --> 00:08:54,720
So who is she? Huang Yanling was a researcher in the lab

106
00:08:54,720 --> 00:08:57,240
working on the virology of bats with Shizheng Li.

107
00:08:57,240 --> 00:09:03,040
Well, she wasn't any of those things. First of all, Matthew Tai told us that the lab he's

108
00:09:03,040 --> 00:09:10,280
referring to is the Wuhan CDC, 280 metres from the seafood market. But Huang Yanling

109
00:09:10,280 --> 00:09:15,600
didn't work there. She worked at the Wuhan Institute of Virology, which is 12 kilometres

110
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:21,840
away on the other side of the Yangtze River. And she didn't work on the virology of bats.

111
00:09:21,840 --> 00:09:26,360
All of her published research is involved with finding a cure for the bacterial infections

112
00:09:26,360 --> 00:09:32,680
streptococcus and methylen-resistant Staphylococcus aureus. She was investigating the pathway

113
00:09:32,680 --> 00:09:38,740
by which these bacteria could be destroyed by viruses, nothing to do with bats at all.

114
00:09:38,740 --> 00:09:43,640
And she's missing. Most people believe her to be patient zero, and most people believe

115
00:09:43,640 --> 00:09:46,040
she's dead. Well, certainly a lot of people copying and

116
00:09:46,040 --> 00:09:52,380
pasting this rumour believe that. But popular belief isn't evidence. So what started all

117
00:09:52,380 --> 00:09:56,320
these rumours? Well, in February, when the virus outbreak

118
00:09:56,320 --> 00:10:01,960
was at its peak in China, someone went onto the website of the Wuhan Institute of Virology

119
00:10:01,960 --> 00:10:07,380
and noticed that there was no photo or bio of one of its ex-students.

120
00:10:07,380 --> 00:10:12,400
This is China, where questions tend to be quickly followed by conjecture. Where's the

121
00:10:12,400 --> 00:10:17,160
photo? If there's no photo, then she must be missing. And if she's missing, she must

122
00:10:17,160 --> 00:10:21,940
be dead. And if she's dead, she must have been involved in bat research and died from

123
00:10:21,940 --> 00:10:26,880
the new coronavirus. And if she caught the new coronavirus, then she must be patient

124
00:10:26,880 --> 00:10:30,240
zero. The story spread across China and was then

125
00:10:30,240 --> 00:10:35,540
popularised in the West by Matthew Tai. Most believe that her body was quickly cremated

126
00:10:35,540 --> 00:10:38,760
and the people working at the crematorium were perhaps infected.

127
00:10:38,760 --> 00:10:44,280
Now that could be true. It is possible most people who are copying and pasting this rumour

128
00:10:44,280 --> 00:10:49,640
do believe her body was cremated and that the cremation crew got infected. Others believe

129
00:10:49,640 --> 00:10:55,920
she spread it through her boyfriend. But again, popular belief is not evidence.

130
00:10:55,920 --> 00:11:00,320
The most convincing evidence that she might be missing is that the government hasn't dispelled

131
00:11:00,320 --> 00:11:05,920
these rumours by finding her. But the sad fact is that people go missing all the time

132
00:11:05,920 --> 00:11:12,720
in China and it's not because they all contracted COVID-19. We're dealing with a country that

133
00:11:12,720 --> 00:11:18,840
practises arbitrary arrest and where the slightest criticism of the government can lead to arrest

134
00:11:18,840 --> 00:11:24,520
or detention or even imprisonment. It can lead to being fired from your job and relocated,

135
00:11:24,520 --> 00:11:28,120
effectively banished, to another part of the country.

136
00:11:28,120 --> 00:11:33,440
And if Huang Yanling is truly alive like they claim, why is her photo and bio removed?

137
00:11:33,480 --> 00:11:39,320
I honestly have no idea, Matthew. And what would be the point in doing that anyway, especially

138
00:11:39,320 --> 00:11:45,040
if her name and her graduation details are still there? She may be missing. She may not

139
00:11:45,040 --> 00:11:50,200
be missing. She may have got run over by a bus. She could be one of many people detained

140
00:11:50,200 --> 00:11:55,460
in China for political reasons. She could be living happily in Chengdu and doesn't particularly

141
00:11:55,460 --> 00:12:02,220
want all this attention. I don't know. You don't know and the millions of people speculating

142
00:12:02,220 --> 00:12:07,820
about this don't know either. We can't just jump to the conclusion that she must be patient

143
00:12:07,820 --> 00:12:13,920
zero because YouTubers, bloggers and chatroom posters believe it. Matthew Tai's third line

144
00:12:13,920 --> 00:12:19,260
of evidence is a job posting on the Wuhan Institute of Virology website. I'll let him

145
00:12:19,260 --> 00:12:24,240
tell you what it says, then I'll show you what it really says.

146
00:12:24,240 --> 00:12:28,640
Which basically says, we've discovered a new and terrible virus and would like to recruit

147
00:12:28,640 --> 00:12:32,780
people to come deal with it. The December 24th posting acknowledges that they've made

148
00:12:32,780 --> 00:12:36,780
a big discovery in human transmissibility and they need more help to deal with it.

149
00:12:36,780 --> 00:12:41,740
OK, so it doesn't say any of that. Matthew is showing you a translation of only part

150
00:12:41,740 --> 00:12:47,640
of the text he showed in Chinese. He's left all this out. And this missing translation

151
00:12:47,640 --> 00:12:53,060
is the part that supposedly says the team has discovered a terrible new virus. In fact,

152
00:12:53,060 --> 00:12:58,500
it doesn't say that at all. It says the team is engaged in long term research that's been

153
00:12:58,500 --> 00:13:04,120
published in 110 papers and has identified a large number of new viruses in bats and

154
00:13:04,120 --> 00:13:10,000
rodents. So these new viruses haven't just been discovered. The term is referring to

155
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:16,460
discoveries made over the last 10 years, and none of them is described as terrible.

156
00:13:16,460 --> 00:13:21,500
Research into bats as carriers of coronavirus is taking place all over the world, from South

157
00:13:21,500 --> 00:13:28,880
Africa to Germany, Kenya, Saudi Arabia, Mexico and of course the United States. Why? Because

158
00:13:28,880 --> 00:13:34,780
these bats are known to be the source of coronavirus infection. And all these research institutes

159
00:13:34,780 --> 00:13:40,720
also advertise for researchers. You don't need to take my word for all this. I put all

160
00:13:40,720 --> 00:13:46,540
of these sources and links in the video description so you can check them. The theory that a female

161
00:13:46,540 --> 00:13:52,700
intern at a Wuhan lab got infected and then spread the virus is not new. It goes back

162
00:13:52,700 --> 00:13:59,000
several months. But its origins are unsubstantiated rumours on the Chinese language internet embellished

163
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:05,120
by bloggers, vloggers and news outlets on the English language internet, based on misreadings,

164
00:14:05,120 --> 00:14:11,740
mix-ups and mistranslations. That's why everyone, especially mainstream media reporters, need

165
00:14:11,740 --> 00:14:14,860
to fact-check this stuff before believing it.

166
00:14:14,860 --> 00:14:21,420
But the idea that the virus leaped from a lab is just too good a story to let go. So

167
00:14:21,420 --> 00:14:26,380
bloggers and journalists are conjuring up all kinds of new evidence. Like a photo taken

168
00:14:26,380 --> 00:14:32,860
supposedly recently inside the secretive Wuhan Institute of Virology, supposedly showing

169
00:14:32,860 --> 00:14:40,180
a broken seal on a fridge containing the SARS-CoV-2 virus. In fact, it was taken two years ago

170
00:14:40,180 --> 00:14:45,660
and posted on the Wuhan Institute of Virology's own website, and it's still there, along

171
00:14:45,660 --> 00:14:51,180
with other photos that the newspapers missed. So there were no SARS-CoV-2 virus samples

172
00:14:51,180 --> 00:14:56,340
in the freezer, and all the virus samples that were there are held in sealed containers

173
00:14:56,340 --> 00:14:59,380
frozen to minus 23 degrees centigrade.

174
00:14:59,380 --> 00:15:02,180
OK, how about this?

175
00:15:02,180 --> 00:15:07,420
So when she heard about the outbreak of the new virus, she was worried that it could have

176
00:15:07,420 --> 00:15:11,620
come from her lab. She spoke about the sleepless nights she suffered worrying whether it was

177
00:15:11,620 --> 00:15:14,060
her lab that was responsible for the outbreak.

178
00:15:14,060 --> 00:15:18,340
Which is understandable. After all, it's possible someone might have come into contact

179
00:15:18,340 --> 00:15:24,100
with bat samples and not noticed. According to the Washington Post, officials from the

180
00:15:24,100 --> 00:15:30,180
US Embassy in Beijing visited the Wuhan Institute of Virology a few years ago and were concerned

181
00:15:30,180 --> 00:15:36,340
about safety standards there. According to the Post, the Chinese researchers at WIV were

182
00:15:36,340 --> 00:15:42,020
receiving assistance from the Galveston National Laboratory, but the Chinese requested additional

183
00:15:42,020 --> 00:15:47,340
help. The cables argued that the United States should give the Wuhan lab further support,

184
00:15:47,340 --> 00:15:53,700
mainly because its research on bat coronaviruses was important but also dangerous.

185
00:15:53,700 --> 00:15:59,700
But after gene sequencing, it turned out that the new virus was not among the viruses collected

186
00:15:59,700 --> 00:16:05,420
from samples taken in the wild. So is it possible it came from a virus the lab possessed that

187
00:16:05,420 --> 00:16:11,500
was similar? That's the claim of a tabloid newspaper now being read out by this YouTuber.

188
00:16:11,500 --> 00:16:17,540
One of the virus samples she had in the laboratory had a 96% genetic match to Covid-19.

189
00:16:17,540 --> 00:16:24,980
What they mean is that it had a 96% genetic match to SARS-CoV-2. Covid-19 is the disease,

190
00:16:24,980 --> 00:16:32,180
not the virus. The newspaper is referring to RATG13, a naturally occurring virus that

191
00:16:32,180 --> 00:16:39,420
the researchers sampled from a bat in Yunnan province. But 96% doesn't make this the same

192
00:16:39,420 --> 00:16:47,260
virus. After all, we humans share 96% of our DNA with chimpanzees. One research team may

193
00:16:47,260 --> 00:16:53,940
have found a much better match, 99%, with a virus found in pangolins. But I can't cite

194
00:16:53,940 --> 00:16:58,100
that definitively because the research hasn't been published yet.

195
00:16:58,100 --> 00:17:02,860
Another popular theory is that the virus was deliberately bio-engineered in an effort

196
00:17:02,860 --> 00:17:08,380
to study bat viruses and then accidentally escape from the lab. The favourite piece of

197
00:17:08,380 --> 00:17:14,460
evidence for this theory is, supposedly, a 2017 article in Nature.

198
00:17:14,460 --> 00:17:21,580
Researchers created a chimeric virus made up of surface protein SHC-014 and the backbone

199
00:17:21,580 --> 00:17:26,180
of a SARS virus that had been adapted to grow mice and to mimic human disease. Kill them.

200
00:17:26,180 --> 00:17:29,900
You'll notice the March Editor's Note on this because this appears to be obviously

201
00:17:29,900 --> 00:17:35,260
related to the question of, was this created in a lab? They say, we are aware this story

202
00:17:35,260 --> 00:17:39,500
is being used as a basis for unverified theories that the novel coronavirus causing Covid-19

203
00:17:39,500 --> 00:17:43,200
was engineered. There's no evidence that this is true. Scientists believe that an animal

204
00:17:43,200 --> 00:17:46,980
is the most likely source of the coronavirus. Well, ultimately, that would still be the

205
00:17:46,980 --> 00:17:49,740
same, even if it was engineered, would it not?

206
00:17:49,740 --> 00:17:54,800
No, it would not. Making assumptions like this based on a failure to understand the

207
00:17:54,800 --> 00:18:00,340
difference between a lab-made virus and one that comes from an animal is exactly why Nature

208
00:18:00,340 --> 00:18:06,060
warned you not to use the paper as the basis for unverified theories. And after reading

209
00:18:06,060 --> 00:18:11,960
that warning out loud, you come straight out with an unverified theory.

210
00:18:11,960 --> 00:18:17,540
Natural viruses and lab-engineered viruses are completely different. Because when researchers

211
00:18:17,540 --> 00:18:22,880
are bio-engineering a virus, they usually don't build the entire thing from scratch.

212
00:18:22,960 --> 00:18:27,920
What they're interested in is the business end of the virus, called the spike proteins.

213
00:18:27,920 --> 00:18:33,260
They house the receptor binding domain, the RBD, where the virus attaches itself to the

214
00:18:33,260 --> 00:18:39,320
host cell and the cleavage sites, where it breaks in and enters the cell.

215
00:18:39,320 --> 00:18:44,200
So except in exceptional circumstances, they build the spike proteins onto the structure

216
00:18:44,200 --> 00:18:50,600
of an existing infectious virus. I suppose the best analogy is graffiti artists. They

217
00:18:50,600 --> 00:18:55,760
usually don't spend lots of time and money building an entire wall from scratch in order

218
00:18:55,760 --> 00:19:01,320
to spray paint their art. They find an existing wall and use that.

219
00:19:01,320 --> 00:19:06,440
When researchers at the Scripps Institute examined the genetic make-up of the new coronavirus,

220
00:19:06,440 --> 00:19:11,520
they discovered that the whole thing was new. Not only that, there was clear evidence that

221
00:19:11,520 --> 00:19:16,800
the virus had evolved. It had genetic sequences that could only be obtained in the presence

222
00:19:16,800 --> 00:19:22,140
of a complete immune system. Battle scars, if you like, showing that it had been forced

223
00:19:22,140 --> 00:19:28,800
to evolve by adapting and trying to overcome immune responses. You don't get that by artificially

224
00:19:28,800 --> 00:19:32,620
growing a virus in the presence of isolated cells.

225
00:19:32,620 --> 00:19:36,880
The Scripps Institute researchers published their findings in Nature Medicine, with the

226
00:19:36,880 --> 00:19:42,840
clear conclusion that it wasn't a laboratory construct. One of the researchers told Science

227
00:19:42,840 --> 00:19:48,280
Daily these two features of the virus, the mutations in the RBD portion of the spike

228
00:19:48,280 --> 00:19:55,040
protein and its distinct backbone, rules out laboratory manipulation as a potential origin

229
00:19:55,040 --> 00:20:00,380
for SARS-CoV-2. The fact that this virus wasn't engineered

230
00:20:00,380 --> 00:20:05,560
rules out another rumour in the English-language blogosphere that it was a bioweapon developed

231
00:20:05,560 --> 00:20:11,100
by the Chinese, and the rumour on the Chinese blogosphere that it was bioengineered by the

232
00:20:11,100 --> 00:20:16,080
US Army. Analysis of the virus has ruled that out.

233
00:20:16,080 --> 00:20:20,920
The Australian tabloid this YouTuber and many others are copying from claims it got all

234
00:20:20,920 --> 00:20:26,500
its information from a leaked dossier compiled by governments, but it won't show it or

235
00:20:26,500 --> 00:20:32,580
tell us who wrote it. A secret leaked dossier does sound more reliable than bloggers, YouTubers

236
00:20:32,580 --> 00:20:37,580
and tabloid newspapers, but it doesn't contain a single piece of information that couldn't

237
00:20:37,580 --> 00:20:41,400
have been found on the internet with a simple Google search.

238
00:20:41,400 --> 00:20:47,780
The information about a 96% match, for example, comes from a Nature paper by Chinese researchers

239
00:20:47,780 --> 00:20:53,060
including Xi Jinping, published in February. The fact that the authors of the supposed

240
00:20:53,060 --> 00:20:59,380
dossier thought Covid-19 as a virus says a lot about their expertise and the extent of

241
00:20:59,380 --> 00:21:03,740
their research. And the information about a chimeric virus

242
00:21:03,740 --> 00:21:09,700
built in a laboratory is hardly secret, it comes from this February paper in Nature.

243
00:21:09,700 --> 00:21:13,900
The quotes about Xi Zhengli worrying that the virus might have come from her laboratory

244
00:21:13,900 --> 00:21:20,180
were published in April in Scientific American etc etc. No need for the telegraph to invoke

245
00:21:20,180 --> 00:21:25,460
a leaked dossier, all this could have been just as easily written by an intern trawling

246
00:21:25,460 --> 00:21:31,540
through the internet and copying and pasting publicly available information.

247
00:21:31,540 --> 00:21:36,100
But as researcher Peter Darshak says, let's look at the balance of probability, that's

248
00:21:36,100 --> 00:21:39,020
what you have to do. That's because there's another laboratory

249
00:21:39,020 --> 00:21:44,340
in China which is a much more likely source of the infection. Unlike the Wuhan Institute

250
00:21:44,340 --> 00:21:50,680
of Virology or the Wuhan CDC, which have just a few researchers handling bat samples using

251
00:21:50,680 --> 00:21:56,740
safety equipment and protocols, this secretive laboratory outside Wuhan employs thousands

252
00:21:56,740 --> 00:22:02,660
of researchers, it's never been inspected by anyone outside of China and yet it has

253
00:22:02,660 --> 00:22:07,940
a much lower level of biosecurity than both of the other labs. Safety equipment here is

254
00:22:07,940 --> 00:22:13,140
completely absent and there have been numerous cases of researchers coming into contact with

255
00:22:13,140 --> 00:22:18,460
bat blood and bat urine. I'm sure you'd agree that this laboratory is a much more likely

256
00:22:18,460 --> 00:22:22,980
source of infection. Now that I've got the attention of the lab

257
00:22:22,980 --> 00:22:28,640
leak believers, the place I'm talking about isn't actually a laboratory. It's the countryside

258
00:22:28,640 --> 00:22:33,520
and the researchers are actually just Chinese farmers and villagers who venture into the

259
00:22:33,520 --> 00:22:39,540
woods and caves around Wuhan, trapping bats for food and digging bat guano for fertiliser.

260
00:22:39,540 --> 00:22:44,240
People live out in rural areas close to bat caves. They're exposed every night when bats

261
00:22:44,240 --> 00:22:49,660
fly over them, urinate, defecate, maybe onto their food or into their drink. And people

262
00:22:49,660 --> 00:22:53,900
go into bat caves, people go in for various reasons. They're going to dig out the bat

263
00:22:53,900 --> 00:22:59,120
guano, the faeces, and they use it as a fertiliser, just like we used to do many years ago with

264
00:22:59,120 --> 00:23:06,380
bird faeces. They go into caves to shelter from the rain. They're farmers, they're subsistence

265
00:23:06,380 --> 00:23:11,300
farmers hunting and eating wildlife, so they get exposed that way.

266
00:23:11,300 --> 00:23:16,740
Even tourists visit caves crowded with bats and infested with bat urine and faeces. So

267
00:23:16,740 --> 00:23:21,700
if the virus made the direct jump from bats to humans, these places where thousands of

268
00:23:21,700 --> 00:23:27,140
unprotected people come into contact with bats and don't isolate themselves are a much

269
00:23:27,140 --> 00:23:34,180
more likely source of infection. So why don't tabloid newspapers write stories about this?

270
00:23:34,180 --> 00:23:39,980
For the same reason I had to call it a laboratory to get people's attention. Secret labs full

271
00:23:39,980 --> 00:23:45,900
of reckless scientists and dangerous experiments releasing deadly viruses make headlines and

272
00:23:45,900 --> 00:23:51,940
sell newspapers, peasant farmers collecting batshit in caves. Well, you can see why people

273
00:23:51,940 --> 00:23:57,580
prefer the lab story. But all that assumes the virus jumped from bats directly to humans

274
00:23:57,580 --> 00:24:02,900
in the first place. Although bats are probably the reservoir for the virus, most researchers

275
00:24:02,900 --> 00:24:09,060
don't think they passed it directly on to humans. According to DNA analysis, SARS-CoV-2

276
00:24:09,060 --> 00:24:14,080
first evolved around 50 years ago in bats, and then most likely spread to humans through

277
00:24:14,080 --> 00:24:20,960
an intermediate species. That was how previous viruses have spread, SARS through civets and

278
00:24:20,960 --> 00:24:27,360
MERS through camels. A likely pathway for SARS-CoV-2 was through pangolins. It's the

279
00:24:27,360 --> 00:24:32,840
world's most trafficked mammal, highly prized in China for food as well as having its scales

280
00:24:32,840 --> 00:24:38,720
used for traditional medicine. As I mentioned earlier, one so far unpublished study found

281
00:24:38,720 --> 00:24:46,400
a virus in pangolins that shared 99% of its DNA with SARS-CoV-2. So what has the Wuhan

282
00:24:46,400 --> 00:24:51,800
seafood market got to do with all this? Well, very early on it was clear that many patients

283
00:24:51,800 --> 00:24:57,920
coming into Wuhan hospitals with pneumonia-like conditions had a connection to the market.

284
00:24:57,920 --> 00:25:03,840
A paper in The Lancet, a British medical journal, confirmed this. It's possible it came to the

285
00:25:03,840 --> 00:25:08,440
market from outside and spread there simply because it's the kind of place where crowds

286
00:25:08,480 --> 00:25:14,760
of people come together, but it's also possible the virus started there. Not by bats, which

287
00:25:14,760 --> 00:25:20,840
weren't sold at the market, but through other animals sold there. Epidemiologists and virologists

288
00:25:20,840 --> 00:25:26,160
have been warning for years that these wild animal sales, where exotic species are brought

289
00:25:26,160 --> 00:25:32,560
together, often alive in closely packed cages, are a breeding ground for new viruses. They've

290
00:25:32,560 --> 00:25:37,760
been calling for the Chinese government to shut them down and stamp out the trade. That's

291
00:25:37,760 --> 00:25:42,200
where the attention needs to be focused, and that's why the Chinese government needs to

292
00:25:42,200 --> 00:25:47,640
be held accountable. It's always easier to blame scientists because that makes for a

293
00:25:47,640 --> 00:25:53,480
better story and a more juicy conspiracy. Most people don't understand science, and

294
00:25:53,480 --> 00:25:57,760
they don't read any of the published research that comes from these institutes, so it's

295
00:25:57,760 --> 00:26:03,240
easy to convince them that these places are secretive and mysterious. It not only sells

296
00:26:03,240 --> 00:26:05,360
newspapers, it sells t-shirts.
