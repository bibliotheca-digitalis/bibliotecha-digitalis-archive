WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:04.840
I was going to make this video about the timeline of the coronavirus outbreak in China, and

00:04.840 --> 00:11.000
as part of that I tracked down an internet rumour that the virus started in a Wuhan lab.

00:11.000 --> 00:15.640
But that rumour has suddenly become front page news, so I'll cut the video short and

00:15.640 --> 00:19.000
just focus on that. I'll leave the rest for another day.

00:19.000 --> 00:24.720
There is a growing belief that the Covid-19 virus originated in the Wuhan lab.

00:24.720 --> 00:29.760
An intern was infected, who later infected her boyfriend, and then went to the wet market

00:29.760 --> 00:35.080
in Wuhan, where it began to spread. So who is this female intern working in a

00:35.080 --> 00:40.000
Wuhan lab, who got infected? Before all this blew up in the mainstream

00:40.000 --> 00:45.360
media, weeks ago I was already following it up, prompted by a post on the forum of my

00:45.360 --> 00:50.360
last video. They knew as early as October 18th 2019 that

00:50.360 --> 00:56.680
this virus had leaked, and that's the day it leaked out of the Wuhan Level 4 biolab.

00:56.720 --> 01:01.680
Unfortunately the poster didn't give a source, but other believers in the lab leak claim

01:01.680 --> 01:05.320
do. First that, a scholar from the South China

01:05.320 --> 01:09.000
University of Technology recently published a paper.

01:09.000 --> 01:13.720
Actually it wasn't so much a published paper as something he wrote and shared on a science

01:13.720 --> 01:19.200
forum. It was posted on 23 different websites around the world and then spread around the

01:19.200 --> 01:23.840
blogosphere. The author's name is Xiao Butao.

01:23.840 --> 01:28.000
But this commentator got his information from a video called I found the source of

01:28.000 --> 01:35.600
the coronavirus by a YouTuber called Laowai86, and I tracked a lot of the Wuhan lab escape

01:35.600 --> 01:40.800
rumours back to the same video, which got over 2 million hits.

01:40.800 --> 01:47.560
Now spoiler alert, Laowai86, real name Matthew Tai, hasn't actually found the source of

01:47.560 --> 01:52.400
the coronavirus. But he does outline a theory that's been bouncing around the Chinese

01:52.400 --> 01:58.280
blogosphere for weeks, and he gives a very comprehensive account of all the evidence.

01:58.280 --> 02:02.080
I'll pick out the bits of his video that give the gist of the story.

02:02.080 --> 02:07.440
Xiao Butao, he was a professor, he posted a thesis. The professor directly pointed out

02:07.440 --> 02:12.760
that the main source of the virus is from the Wuhan lab, which is only 300, or actually

02:12.760 --> 02:17.860
280 metres to be exact, from the Huanan seafood market. He also gives a clear timeline and

02:17.860 --> 02:22.620
has information that researchers were splashed with urine and blood samples from all the

02:22.620 --> 02:28.540
bats that were collected. People working in the lab claim to have been splashed with coronavirus

02:28.540 --> 02:34.060
containing vials. Huang Yanling was a researcher in the lab working on the virology of bats

02:34.060 --> 02:40.260
with Shi Zhengli, and she's missing. Most people believe her to be patient zero, and

02:40.260 --> 02:45.500
most people believe she's dead, and her online presence has been scrubbed from existence,

02:45.500 --> 02:51.420
all happening in a lab 280m away from the Huanan seafood market. The December 24th posting

02:51.420 --> 02:55.460
acknowledges that they've made a big discovery in human transmissibility, and they need more

02:55.460 --> 02:56.580
help to deal with it.

02:56.580 --> 03:02.340
I hope you all followed that. If not, here's a summary of the theory. It all sounds very

03:02.340 --> 03:07.740
well researched and very convincing. But of course it needs to be fact checked, and the

03:07.740 --> 03:13.480
way we do that is to ask two basic questions. What's the evidence, and what are the sources

03:13.480 --> 03:19.520
for this evidence? There are three main lines, starting with the aforementioned Xiao Butao.

03:19.520 --> 03:22.320
He knew researchers at the lab that were infected.

03:22.320 --> 03:27.040
Correction, he didn't know any researchers at the lab. This is where it pays to check

03:27.040 --> 03:33.120
by reading the source, Xiao Butao's internet post, which I'm showing you on the screen.

03:33.120 --> 03:39.160
He didn't even know the lab. He said he discovered the two labs in Wuhan, not one, by doing a

03:39.160 --> 03:44.720
search on the internet. One is the Wuhan Centre for Disease Control and Prevention,

03:44.720 --> 03:50.960
just 280m from the Wuhan seafood market, where the virus was thought to have spread. The

03:50.960 --> 03:56.440
other is the Wuhan Institute of Virology, about 12km away.

03:56.440 --> 04:01.080
The professor directly pointed out that the main source of the virus is from the Wuhan

04:01.080 --> 04:02.080
lab.

04:02.080 --> 04:03.240
OK, but which one?

04:03.240 --> 04:08.320
Which is only 300, or actually 280m to be exact, from the Huanan seafood market.

04:08.320 --> 04:13.440
Ah, so Matthew Tai is referring to the Wuhan Centre for Disease Control and Prevention,

04:13.440 --> 04:20.240
which we'll call the Wuhan CDC. That's the one 280m from the Wuhan seafood market, and

04:20.240 --> 04:22.240
the one he shows on the map.

04:22.240 --> 04:26.760
He also gives a clear timeline and has information that researchers were splashed with urine

04:26.760 --> 04:29.920
and blood samples from all the bats that were collected.

04:29.920 --> 04:36.080
No, Xiao Butao says one researcher, with the initials JHT, was splashed with bat blood

04:36.080 --> 04:41.720
and urine, on different occasions, while he was collecting samples in caves nowhere

04:41.720 --> 04:47.640
near the Wuhan CDC, which is the institute he worked for. The timeline is not clear,

04:47.640 --> 04:53.000
but as we'll see from Xiao Butao's 2017 source, this happened several years before

04:53.000 --> 04:55.400
the novel coronavirus outbreak.

04:55.400 --> 04:59.200
And they had already begun self-quarantine after they showed symptoms of being infected?

04:59.200 --> 05:04.620
No, again, there's no they. This was one person, far from the lab, and he showed no

05:04.620 --> 05:10.100
symptoms of being infected. All this is spelled out in Xiao Butao's post, which Matthew

05:10.100 --> 05:13.180
Tai is supposed to be quoting.

05:13.180 --> 05:17.920
But I hear you say it says on Matthew Tai's screen that the researchers at the Wuhan virus

05:17.920 --> 05:23.160
laboratory were splashed with bat blood and urine. It says so right there.

05:23.160 --> 05:28.060
But what Matthew Tai's video is showing you on the screen, for some reason, is not

05:28.060 --> 05:34.140
Xiao Butao's post, but a translated report from Radio France Internationale. It comes

05:34.140 --> 05:40.420
from their Hong Kong correspondent, and as we'll see, it's ridiculously inaccurate.

05:40.420 --> 05:44.820
The professor directly pointed out that the main source of the virus is from the Wuhan

05:44.820 --> 05:45.820
lab.

05:45.820 --> 05:53.080
No, Xiao doesn't say that at all. He only says it's possible, and plausible, and probable.

05:53.080 --> 05:56.900
These are three different things, so take your pick. But nowhere does it say that the

05:56.900 --> 06:03.160
main source of the virus was the Wuhan CDC or any other research facility.

06:03.180 --> 06:07.460
But that's what Matthew Tai and his followers now believe, so let's figure out how this

06:07.460 --> 06:12.400
story got so terribly mangled and embellished in its many retellings.

06:12.400 --> 06:18.820
Xiao Butao's information about researcher JHT and the bat blood and bat pee comes, he

06:18.820 --> 06:23.760
tells us, from a couple of media reports. He only gives an English translation of the

06:23.760 --> 06:30.600
titles, the first of which is by a reporter called Tao, initial P. Based on that, I tracked

06:30.600 --> 06:36.400
down an article with a similar title in Chinese by a reporter called Tao Pan, featuring a

06:36.400 --> 06:42.400
bat researcher called Tian Junhua. If his family name is placed last, as in Western

06:42.400 --> 06:48.940
tradition, that gives the initials JHT. The story tells of how on different occasions

06:48.940 --> 06:53.960
blood and on one occasion urine had splashed on him while he was out collecting bats in

06:53.960 --> 07:00.440
the wild, and that he had isolated himself for 14 days because of the risk of infection.

07:00.440 --> 07:06.960
However, the article makes clear he was never infected. The timeline for these incidents

07:06.960 --> 07:15.720
is after 2012 when he started collecting bats and before 2017 when the article was published.

07:15.720 --> 07:22.600
This is the researcher in question, Tian Junhua, filmed for a documentary about his research.

07:22.600 --> 07:27.840
And Xiao Butao seems to have accurately relayed what Tao Pan reported, just leaving out the

07:27.840 --> 07:33.760
dates. The Radio France Internationale reporter then seems to have mangled these different

07:33.760 --> 07:40.240
elements of Xiao Butao's post and embellished them. He turns a single researcher into several,

07:40.240 --> 07:45.620
he merges the separate incidents of bat blood and bat urine into a single incident, and

07:45.620 --> 07:50.200
then he moves the scene of the action from the caves of Hubei province into something

07:50.200 --> 07:55.800
called the Wuhan Virology Lab. But there's no such place, of course. He's conflated

07:55.800 --> 08:02.080
two separate institutes into one. Matthew Tai then adds an embellishment of his own.

08:02.080 --> 08:08.760
Instead of these non-existent lab workers not being infected, he claims they were infected.

08:08.760 --> 08:13.480
As I said, over two million people have seen this video, and of course lots of bloggers

08:13.480 --> 08:18.640
and commentators have copied Matthew Tai's version of Radio France's version of Xiao

08:18.640 --> 08:22.440
Butao's version of Tao Pan's version of the story.

08:22.440 --> 08:26.320
OK, so let's look at Matthew Tai's second piece of evidence.

08:26.320 --> 08:30.400
During my research, a name kept popping up. Huang Yanling.

08:30.400 --> 08:36.600
If research means simply googling keywords like Wuhan, bat, and patient zero, and reading

08:36.600 --> 08:41.640
blogs, chat rooms, Twitter, and its Chinese equivalent Weibo, then it's not surprising

08:41.640 --> 08:46.840
that Huang Yanling's name keeps popping up, because she's been the focus of a conspiracy

08:46.840 --> 08:51.140
theory circulated in China since early February.

08:51.140 --> 08:54.720
So who is she? Huang Yanling was a researcher in the lab

08:54.720 --> 08:57.240
working on the virology of bats with Shizheng Li.

08:57.240 --> 09:03.040
Well, she wasn't any of those things. First of all, Matthew Tai told us that the lab he's

09:03.040 --> 09:10.280
referring to is the Wuhan CDC, 280 metres from the seafood market. But Huang Yanling

09:10.280 --> 09:15.600
didn't work there. She worked at the Wuhan Institute of Virology, which is 12 kilometres

09:15.600 --> 09:21.840
away on the other side of the Yangtze River. And she didn't work on the virology of bats.

09:21.840 --> 09:26.360
All of her published research is involved with finding a cure for the bacterial infections

09:26.360 --> 09:32.680
streptococcus and methylen-resistant Staphylococcus aureus. She was investigating the pathway

09:32.680 --> 09:38.740
by which these bacteria could be destroyed by viruses, nothing to do with bats at all.

09:38.740 --> 09:43.640
And she's missing. Most people believe her to be patient zero, and most people believe

09:43.640 --> 09:46.040
she's dead. Well, certainly a lot of people copying and

09:46.040 --> 09:52.380
pasting this rumour believe that. But popular belief isn't evidence. So what started all

09:52.380 --> 09:56.320
these rumours? Well, in February, when the virus outbreak

09:56.320 --> 10:01.960
was at its peak in China, someone went onto the website of the Wuhan Institute of Virology

10:01.960 --> 10:07.380
and noticed that there was no photo or bio of one of its ex-students.

10:07.380 --> 10:12.400
This is China, where questions tend to be quickly followed by conjecture. Where's the

10:12.400 --> 10:17.160
photo? If there's no photo, then she must be missing. And if she's missing, she must

10:17.160 --> 10:21.940
be dead. And if she's dead, she must have been involved in bat research and died from

10:21.940 --> 10:26.880
the new coronavirus. And if she caught the new coronavirus, then she must be patient

10:26.880 --> 10:30.240
zero. The story spread across China and was then

10:30.240 --> 10:35.540
popularised in the West by Matthew Tai. Most believe that her body was quickly cremated

10:35.540 --> 10:38.760
and the people working at the crematorium were perhaps infected.

10:38.760 --> 10:44.280
Now that could be true. It is possible most people who are copying and pasting this rumour

10:44.280 --> 10:49.640
do believe her body was cremated and that the cremation crew got infected. Others believe

10:49.640 --> 10:55.920
she spread it through her boyfriend. But again, popular belief is not evidence.

10:55.920 --> 11:00.320
The most convincing evidence that she might be missing is that the government hasn't dispelled

11:00.320 --> 11:05.920
these rumours by finding her. But the sad fact is that people go missing all the time

11:05.920 --> 11:12.720
in China and it's not because they all contracted COVID-19. We're dealing with a country that

11:12.720 --> 11:18.840
practises arbitrary arrest and where the slightest criticism of the government can lead to arrest

11:18.840 --> 11:24.520
or detention or even imprisonment. It can lead to being fired from your job and relocated,

11:24.520 --> 11:28.120
effectively banished, to another part of the country.

11:28.120 --> 11:33.440
And if Huang Yanling is truly alive like they claim, why is her photo and bio removed?

11:33.480 --> 11:39.320
I honestly have no idea, Matthew. And what would be the point in doing that anyway, especially

11:39.320 --> 11:45.040
if her name and her graduation details are still there? She may be missing. She may not

11:45.040 --> 11:50.200
be missing. She may have got run over by a bus. She could be one of many people detained

11:50.200 --> 11:55.460
in China for political reasons. She could be living happily in Chengdu and doesn't particularly

11:55.460 --> 12:02.220
want all this attention. I don't know. You don't know and the millions of people speculating

12:02.220 --> 12:07.820
about this don't know either. We can't just jump to the conclusion that she must be patient

12:07.820 --> 12:13.920
zero because YouTubers, bloggers and chatroom posters believe it. Matthew Tai's third line

12:13.920 --> 12:19.260
of evidence is a job posting on the Wuhan Institute of Virology website. I'll let him

12:19.260 --> 12:24.240
tell you what it says, then I'll show you what it really says.

12:24.240 --> 12:28.640
Which basically says, we've discovered a new and terrible virus and would like to recruit

12:28.640 --> 12:32.780
people to come deal with it. The December 24th posting acknowledges that they've made

12:32.780 --> 12:36.780
a big discovery in human transmissibility and they need more help to deal with it.

12:36.780 --> 12:41.740
OK, so it doesn't say any of that. Matthew is showing you a translation of only part

12:41.740 --> 12:47.640
of the text he showed in Chinese. He's left all this out. And this missing translation

12:47.640 --> 12:53.060
is the part that supposedly says the team has discovered a terrible new virus. In fact,

12:53.060 --> 12:58.500
it doesn't say that at all. It says the team is engaged in long term research that's been

12:58.500 --> 13:04.120
published in 110 papers and has identified a large number of new viruses in bats and

13:04.120 --> 13:10.000
rodents. So these new viruses haven't just been discovered. The term is referring to

13:10.000 --> 13:16.460
discoveries made over the last 10 years, and none of them is described as terrible.

13:16.460 --> 13:21.500
Research into bats as carriers of coronavirus is taking place all over the world, from South

13:21.500 --> 13:28.880
Africa to Germany, Kenya, Saudi Arabia, Mexico and of course the United States. Why? Because

13:28.880 --> 13:34.780
these bats are known to be the source of coronavirus infection. And all these research institutes

13:34.780 --> 13:40.720
also advertise for researchers. You don't need to take my word for all this. I put all

13:40.720 --> 13:46.540
of these sources and links in the video description so you can check them. The theory that a female

13:46.540 --> 13:52.700
intern at a Wuhan lab got infected and then spread the virus is not new. It goes back

13:52.700 --> 13:59.000
several months. But its origins are unsubstantiated rumours on the Chinese language internet embellished

13:59.000 --> 14:05.120
by bloggers, vloggers and news outlets on the English language internet, based on misreadings,

14:05.120 --> 14:11.740
mix-ups and mistranslations. That's why everyone, especially mainstream media reporters, need

14:11.740 --> 14:14.860
to fact-check this stuff before believing it.

14:14.860 --> 14:21.420
But the idea that the virus leaped from a lab is just too good a story to let go. So

14:21.420 --> 14:26.380
bloggers and journalists are conjuring up all kinds of new evidence. Like a photo taken

14:26.380 --> 14:32.860
supposedly recently inside the secretive Wuhan Institute of Virology, supposedly showing

14:32.860 --> 14:40.180
a broken seal on a fridge containing the SARS-CoV-2 virus. In fact, it was taken two years ago

14:40.180 --> 14:45.660
and posted on the Wuhan Institute of Virology's own website, and it's still there, along

14:45.660 --> 14:51.180
with other photos that the newspapers missed. So there were no SARS-CoV-2 virus samples

14:51.180 --> 14:56.340
in the freezer, and all the virus samples that were there are held in sealed containers

14:56.340 --> 14:59.380
frozen to minus 23 degrees centigrade.

14:59.380 --> 15:02.180
OK, how about this?

15:02.180 --> 15:07.420
So when she heard about the outbreak of the new virus, she was worried that it could have

15:07.420 --> 15:11.620
come from her lab. She spoke about the sleepless nights she suffered worrying whether it was

15:11.620 --> 15:14.060
her lab that was responsible for the outbreak.

15:14.060 --> 15:18.340
Which is understandable. After all, it's possible someone might have come into contact

15:18.340 --> 15:24.100
with bat samples and not noticed. According to the Washington Post, officials from the

15:24.100 --> 15:30.180
US Embassy in Beijing visited the Wuhan Institute of Virology a few years ago and were concerned

15:30.180 --> 15:36.340
about safety standards there. According to the Post, the Chinese researchers at WIV were

15:36.340 --> 15:42.020
receiving assistance from the Galveston National Laboratory, but the Chinese requested additional

15:42.020 --> 15:47.340
help. The cables argued that the United States should give the Wuhan lab further support,

15:47.340 --> 15:53.700
mainly because its research on bat coronaviruses was important but also dangerous.

15:53.700 --> 15:59.700
But after gene sequencing, it turned out that the new virus was not among the viruses collected

15:59.700 --> 16:05.420
from samples taken in the wild. So is it possible it came from a virus the lab possessed that

16:05.420 --> 16:11.500
was similar? That's the claim of a tabloid newspaper now being read out by this YouTuber.

16:11.500 --> 16:17.540
One of the virus samples she had in the laboratory had a 96% genetic match to Covid-19.

16:17.540 --> 16:24.980
What they mean is that it had a 96% genetic match to SARS-CoV-2. Covid-19 is the disease,

16:24.980 --> 16:32.180
not the virus. The newspaper is referring to RATG13, a naturally occurring virus that

16:32.180 --> 16:39.420
the researchers sampled from a bat in Yunnan province. But 96% doesn't make this the same

16:39.420 --> 16:47.260
virus. After all, we humans share 96% of our DNA with chimpanzees. One research team may

16:47.260 --> 16:53.940
have found a much better match, 99%, with a virus found in pangolins. But I can't cite

16:53.940 --> 16:58.100
that definitively because the research hasn't been published yet.

16:58.100 --> 17:02.860
Another popular theory is that the virus was deliberately bio-engineered in an effort

17:02.860 --> 17:08.380
to study bat viruses and then accidentally escape from the lab. The favourite piece of

17:08.380 --> 17:14.460
evidence for this theory is, supposedly, a 2017 article in Nature.

17:14.460 --> 17:21.580
Researchers created a chimeric virus made up of surface protein SHC-014 and the backbone

17:21.580 --> 17:26.180
of a SARS virus that had been adapted to grow mice and to mimic human disease. Kill them.

17:26.180 --> 17:29.900
You'll notice the March Editor's Note on this because this appears to be obviously

17:29.900 --> 17:35.260
related to the question of, was this created in a lab? They say, we are aware this story

17:35.260 --> 17:39.500
is being used as a basis for unverified theories that the novel coronavirus causing Covid-19

17:39.500 --> 17:43.200
was engineered. There's no evidence that this is true. Scientists believe that an animal

17:43.200 --> 17:46.980
is the most likely source of the coronavirus. Well, ultimately, that would still be the

17:46.980 --> 17:49.740
same, even if it was engineered, would it not?

17:49.740 --> 17:54.800
No, it would not. Making assumptions like this based on a failure to understand the

17:54.800 --> 18:00.340
difference between a lab-made virus and one that comes from an animal is exactly why Nature

18:00.340 --> 18:06.060
warned you not to use the paper as the basis for unverified theories. And after reading

18:06.060 --> 18:11.960
that warning out loud, you come straight out with an unverified theory.

18:11.960 --> 18:17.540
Natural viruses and lab-engineered viruses are completely different. Because when researchers

18:17.540 --> 18:22.880
are bio-engineering a virus, they usually don't build the entire thing from scratch.

18:22.960 --> 18:27.920
What they're interested in is the business end of the virus, called the spike proteins.

18:27.920 --> 18:33.260
They house the receptor binding domain, the RBD, where the virus attaches itself to the

18:33.260 --> 18:39.320
host cell and the cleavage sites, where it breaks in and enters the cell.

18:39.320 --> 18:44.200
So except in exceptional circumstances, they build the spike proteins onto the structure

18:44.200 --> 18:50.600
of an existing infectious virus. I suppose the best analogy is graffiti artists. They

18:50.600 --> 18:55.760
usually don't spend lots of time and money building an entire wall from scratch in order

18:55.760 --> 19:01.320
to spray paint their art. They find an existing wall and use that.

19:01.320 --> 19:06.440
When researchers at the Scripps Institute examined the genetic make-up of the new coronavirus,

19:06.440 --> 19:11.520
they discovered that the whole thing was new. Not only that, there was clear evidence that

19:11.520 --> 19:16.800
the virus had evolved. It had genetic sequences that could only be obtained in the presence

19:16.800 --> 19:22.140
of a complete immune system. Battle scars, if you like, showing that it had been forced

19:22.140 --> 19:28.800
to evolve by adapting and trying to overcome immune responses. You don't get that by artificially

19:28.800 --> 19:32.620
growing a virus in the presence of isolated cells.

19:32.620 --> 19:36.880
The Scripps Institute researchers published their findings in Nature Medicine, with the

19:36.880 --> 19:42.840
clear conclusion that it wasn't a laboratory construct. One of the researchers told Science

19:42.840 --> 19:48.280
Daily these two features of the virus, the mutations in the RBD portion of the spike

19:48.280 --> 19:55.040
protein and its distinct backbone, rules out laboratory manipulation as a potential origin

19:55.040 --> 20:00.380
for SARS-CoV-2. The fact that this virus wasn't engineered

20:00.380 --> 20:05.560
rules out another rumour in the English-language blogosphere that it was a bioweapon developed

20:05.560 --> 20:11.100
by the Chinese, and the rumour on the Chinese blogosphere that it was bioengineered by the

20:11.100 --> 20:16.080
US Army. Analysis of the virus has ruled that out.

20:16.080 --> 20:20.920
The Australian tabloid this YouTuber and many others are copying from claims it got all

20:20.920 --> 20:26.500
its information from a leaked dossier compiled by governments, but it won't show it or

20:26.500 --> 20:32.580
tell us who wrote it. A secret leaked dossier does sound more reliable than bloggers, YouTubers

20:32.580 --> 20:37.580
and tabloid newspapers, but it doesn't contain a single piece of information that couldn't

20:37.580 --> 20:41.400
have been found on the internet with a simple Google search.

20:41.400 --> 20:47.780
The information about a 96% match, for example, comes from a Nature paper by Chinese researchers

20:47.780 --> 20:53.060
including Xi Jinping, published in February. The fact that the authors of the supposed

20:53.060 --> 20:59.380
dossier thought Covid-19 as a virus says a lot about their expertise and the extent of

20:59.380 --> 21:03.740
their research. And the information about a chimeric virus

21:03.740 --> 21:09.700
built in a laboratory is hardly secret, it comes from this February paper in Nature.

21:09.700 --> 21:13.900
The quotes about Xi Zhengli worrying that the virus might have come from her laboratory

21:13.900 --> 21:20.180
were published in April in Scientific American etc etc. No need for the telegraph to invoke

21:20.180 --> 21:25.460
a leaked dossier, all this could have been just as easily written by an intern trawling

21:25.460 --> 21:31.540
through the internet and copying and pasting publicly available information.

21:31.540 --> 21:36.100
But as researcher Peter Darshak says, let's look at the balance of probability, that's

21:36.100 --> 21:39.020
what you have to do. That's because there's another laboratory

21:39.020 --> 21:44.340
in China which is a much more likely source of the infection. Unlike the Wuhan Institute

21:44.340 --> 21:50.680
of Virology or the Wuhan CDC, which have just a few researchers handling bat samples using

21:50.680 --> 21:56.740
safety equipment and protocols, this secretive laboratory outside Wuhan employs thousands

21:56.740 --> 22:02.660
of researchers, it's never been inspected by anyone outside of China and yet it has

22:02.660 --> 22:07.940
a much lower level of biosecurity than both of the other labs. Safety equipment here is

22:07.940 --> 22:13.140
completely absent and there have been numerous cases of researchers coming into contact with

22:13.140 --> 22:18.460
bat blood and bat urine. I'm sure you'd agree that this laboratory is a much more likely

22:18.460 --> 22:22.980
source of infection. Now that I've got the attention of the lab

22:22.980 --> 22:28.640
leak believers, the place I'm talking about isn't actually a laboratory. It's the countryside

22:28.640 --> 22:33.520
and the researchers are actually just Chinese farmers and villagers who venture into the

22:33.520 --> 22:39.540
woods and caves around Wuhan, trapping bats for food and digging bat guano for fertiliser.

22:39.540 --> 22:44.240
People live out in rural areas close to bat caves. They're exposed every night when bats

22:44.240 --> 22:49.660
fly over them, urinate, defecate, maybe onto their food or into their drink. And people

22:49.660 --> 22:53.900
go into bat caves, people go in for various reasons. They're going to dig out the bat

22:53.900 --> 22:59.120
guano, the faeces, and they use it as a fertiliser, just like we used to do many years ago with

22:59.120 --> 23:06.380
bird faeces. They go into caves to shelter from the rain. They're farmers, they're subsistence

23:06.380 --> 23:11.300
farmers hunting and eating wildlife, so they get exposed that way.

23:11.300 --> 23:16.740
Even tourists visit caves crowded with bats and infested with bat urine and faeces. So

23:16.740 --> 23:21.700
if the virus made the direct jump from bats to humans, these places where thousands of

23:21.700 --> 23:27.140
unprotected people come into contact with bats and don't isolate themselves are a much

23:27.140 --> 23:34.180
more likely source of infection. So why don't tabloid newspapers write stories about this?

23:34.180 --> 23:39.980
For the same reason I had to call it a laboratory to get people's attention. Secret labs full

23:39.980 --> 23:45.900
of reckless scientists and dangerous experiments releasing deadly viruses make headlines and

23:45.900 --> 23:51.940
sell newspapers, peasant farmers collecting batshit in caves. Well, you can see why people

23:51.940 --> 23:57.580
prefer the lab story. But all that assumes the virus jumped from bats directly to humans

23:57.580 --> 24:02.900
in the first place. Although bats are probably the reservoir for the virus, most researchers

24:02.900 --> 24:09.060
don't think they passed it directly on to humans. According to DNA analysis, SARS-CoV-2

24:09.060 --> 24:14.080
first evolved around 50 years ago in bats, and then most likely spread to humans through

24:14.080 --> 24:20.960
an intermediate species. That was how previous viruses have spread, SARS through civets and

24:20.960 --> 24:27.360
MERS through camels. A likely pathway for SARS-CoV-2 was through pangolins. It's the

24:27.360 --> 24:32.840
world's most trafficked mammal, highly prized in China for food as well as having its scales

24:32.840 --> 24:38.720
used for traditional medicine. As I mentioned earlier, one so far unpublished study found

24:38.720 --> 24:46.400
a virus in pangolins that shared 99% of its DNA with SARS-CoV-2. So what has the Wuhan

24:46.400 --> 24:51.800
seafood market got to do with all this? Well, very early on it was clear that many patients

24:51.800 --> 24:57.920
coming into Wuhan hospitals with pneumonia-like conditions had a connection to the market.

24:57.920 --> 25:03.840
A paper in The Lancet, a British medical journal, confirmed this. It's possible it came to the

25:03.840 --> 25:08.440
market from outside and spread there simply because it's the kind of place where crowds

25:08.480 --> 25:14.760
of people come together, but it's also possible the virus started there. Not by bats, which

25:14.760 --> 25:20.840
weren't sold at the market, but through other animals sold there. Epidemiologists and virologists

25:20.840 --> 25:26.160
have been warning for years that these wild animal sales, where exotic species are brought

25:26.160 --> 25:32.560
together, often alive in closely packed cages, are a breeding ground for new viruses. They've

25:32.560 --> 25:37.760
been calling for the Chinese government to shut them down and stamp out the trade. That's

25:37.760 --> 25:42.200
where the attention needs to be focused, and that's why the Chinese government needs to

25:42.200 --> 25:47.640
be held accountable. It's always easier to blame scientists because that makes for a

25:47.640 --> 25:53.480
better story and a more juicy conspiracy. Most people don't understand science, and

25:53.480 --> 25:57.760
they don't read any of the published research that comes from these institutes, so it's

25:57.760 --> 26:03.240
easy to convince them that these places are secretive and mysterious. It not only sells

26:03.240 --> 26:05.360
newspapers, it sells t-shirts.
