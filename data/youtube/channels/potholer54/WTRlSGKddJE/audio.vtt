00:00.000 --> 00:05.280
For those who are skeptical about the rise in sea level caused by global warming, here

00:05.280 --> 00:07.520
are some scientific predictions that were made.

00:07.520 --> 00:10.760
So we were told sea levels would rise and we'd have to evacuate the coasts.

00:10.760 --> 00:15.280
Let's take a look here, Sydney Harbor, 140 years.

00:15.280 --> 00:22.160
He predicted that within 30 years, i.e. this year, lower Manhattan would be under water.

00:22.160 --> 00:25.360
And here's how scientists measure that sea level rise.

00:25.360 --> 00:26.360
Just there.

00:26.360 --> 00:28.800
It's going up by about a millimeter.

00:28.800 --> 00:29.800
Rising sea level.

00:29.800 --> 00:30.800
You got it?

00:30.800 --> 00:31.800
I've got it.

00:31.800 --> 00:32.800
Three mil.

00:32.800 --> 00:33.800
Well, no prizes for guessing.

00:33.800 --> 00:39.440
This isn't how they measure sea level rise and these aren't scientific predictions.

00:39.440 --> 00:44.000
They're just what bloggers and pundits think scientific predictions and measurements are

00:44.000 --> 00:49.680
because when they do their own research, they don't check scientific studies to find out.

00:49.680 --> 00:54.520
They just get their information from other TV shows, books, newspaper columnists and

00:54.520 --> 00:55.520
bloggers.

00:56.080 --> 01:01.520
We'll take a look at the real scientific predictions and how sea level rise is being measured later

01:01.520 --> 01:03.800
in the video.

01:03.800 --> 01:05.280
Why do the critics do it?

01:05.280 --> 01:11.200
Well, of course, it's a very old tactic, taking a leaf out of the creationist manual.

01:11.200 --> 01:15.080
Invent your own science, create your own scientist, even.

01:15.080 --> 01:17.280
Make his claims as stupid as possible.

01:17.280 --> 01:22.680
I think what you must remember is that as true scientists, we are constantly searching

01:22.680 --> 01:23.680
for evidence.

01:23.680 --> 01:27.680
Prove that which we already believe to be truth.

01:27.680 --> 01:32.280
And then amaze your audience with your skill in demolishing them.

01:32.280 --> 01:37.540
So if the science critics aren't explaining what the science says, where do you go?

01:37.540 --> 01:41.760
The same place real scientists go when they want to look at the latest discoveries in

01:41.760 --> 01:46.120
their field, respected peer-reviewed scientific journals.

01:46.120 --> 01:50.420
And if you find these rather daunting, then get your information from reputable science

01:50.420 --> 01:55.620
media where these studies are accurately reported and cited.

01:55.620 --> 02:00.500
Now you may not trust or believe the studies, maybe you think they're part of a huge worldwide

02:00.500 --> 02:06.140
conspiracy, but at least you'll know what they actually say instead of relying on spurious

02:06.140 --> 02:11.100
blogs and news pundits to misinform you about what they say.

02:11.100 --> 02:14.820
Before we look at the fallacies, let's start with the basics.

02:14.820 --> 02:20.620
Why are sea levels rising and expected to rise further as the Earth heats up?

02:20.620 --> 02:25.900
The most obvious reason is that higher temperatures mean more ice is melting, which I'm sure makes

02:25.900 --> 02:29.020
perfect sense even to people who never studied science.

02:29.020 --> 02:33.540
How long will it take for the sea level to rise two feet?

02:33.540 --> 02:38.180
Think about it, if your ice cube melts in your glass, it doesn't overflow, it's displacement.

02:38.180 --> 02:41.380
This is the thing, some of the things that they're talking about, mathematically and

02:41.380 --> 02:43.580
scientifically don't make sense.

02:43.620 --> 02:48.380
OK, they don't make sense to one person who never studied science, so for Congressman

02:48.380 --> 02:53.420
Stockman's benefit I'll explain the physics in words of one syllable, because it really

02:53.420 --> 02:55.540
is that simple.

02:55.540 --> 03:01.540
Land, ice, melt, fill, rise.

03:01.540 --> 03:04.820
Think about it, if your ice cube melts in your glass, it doesn't overflow.

03:04.820 --> 03:09.940
But the great thing about basic physics is that you can do a lot of the experiments yourself.

03:09.940 --> 03:15.300
Put a draining board to represent Greenland over a glass, put some ice on it to represent

03:15.300 --> 03:18.980
Greenland's ice cap, and what do you get?

03:18.980 --> 03:23.060
Ice, melt, fill, rise.

03:23.060 --> 03:27.060
The real lesson from this is that any time a politician tells you he's spotted a flaw

03:27.060 --> 03:32.500
in the laws of physics that scientists have overlooked, put your money on the scientists

03:32.500 --> 03:35.540
knowing something he doesn't.

03:35.540 --> 03:39.860
Like all good science, this melt isn't just obvious in theory, it can be measured

03:39.860 --> 03:42.260
and quantified in practice.

03:42.260 --> 03:47.580
For example, a satellite system called GRACE constantly records the mass of ice on top

03:47.580 --> 03:51.140
of Greenland using a gravitometer.

03:51.140 --> 03:56.460
Research has found that Greenland has been losing around 255 billion tonnes of ice every

03:56.460 --> 03:57.460
year.

03:57.460 --> 04:01.940
That means the amount of ice lost through melting and ablation, minus the amount gained

04:01.940 --> 04:04.220
through precipitation.

04:04.260 --> 04:08.700
Green glaciers are also contributing a huge amount to sea level rise.

04:08.700 --> 04:15.300
There are about 200,000 glaciers worldwide, covering roughly 10% of the Earth's surface.

04:15.300 --> 04:21.980
Outside of Greenland, glaciers are losing some 267 billion tonnes of ice every year,

04:21.980 --> 04:29.700
contributing to a rise of about 0.7mm in sea levels annually, 20% of the total rise.

04:29.700 --> 04:35.940
The other half of the rise, less well-known, is the expansion of water as it gets warmer.

04:35.940 --> 04:39.840
The fact that the oceans are getting warmer has been directly measured, and the fact that

04:39.840 --> 04:44.700
warming water expands is another well-known principle of physics.

04:44.700 --> 04:49.860
And again, you can actually do this experiment yourself to be sure it's not just a conspiracy

04:49.860 --> 04:54.100
by 18th century scientists who first discovered it.

04:54.100 --> 04:56.660
Just follow the instructions.

04:56.660 --> 04:58.380
There are a couple of other factors.

04:58.380 --> 05:00.340
One is terrestrial storage.

05:00.340 --> 05:06.780
So during extensive flooding in Pakistan in 2010, sea level actually fell temporarily.

05:06.780 --> 05:10.560
But these ups and downs don't change the long-term picture.

05:10.560 --> 05:17.140
And sea level is also affected by eustatic changes, movement of the land rising and falling.

05:17.140 --> 05:22.220
A failure to understand this eustatic movement has often led to fallacious news reports from

05:22.220 --> 05:33.300
Reuters and others claiming ridiculously high rises in sea level because in this case

05:33.300 --> 05:39.980
the reporter was unaware that the crustal plate on which she's standing has been subsiding.

05:39.980 --> 05:44.660
Scientists on the other hand factor these eustatic changes into their measurements.

05:44.660 --> 05:50.120
The amount of melting ice from Greenland and glaciers outside Greenland is accelerating

05:50.120 --> 05:52.360
at the high end of predictions.

05:52.360 --> 05:57.400
And this, combined with a more rapid expansion of warmer water, has led to an acceleration

05:57.400 --> 06:01.120
in sea level rise over the last few decades.

06:01.120 --> 06:07.340
If we go back to the end of the last glaciation, after a 400ft rise due to melting ice sheets,

06:07.340 --> 06:12.660
there hasn't been much of a change in sea level for the last 3,700 years.

06:12.660 --> 06:17.760
This can be determined by taking sediment cores from coastal zones, dating coral growth

06:17.760 --> 06:23.380
rates and other techniques that, put together, show a picture of a very small and steady

06:23.380 --> 06:27.040
rise of less than a millimetre a year.

06:27.040 --> 06:32.600
But during the 20th century, when global temperatures went up significantly, sea level rise more

06:32.600 --> 06:42.720
than doubled from 0.8mm a year to 1.9mm a year, then accelerated again to 3.1mm a year.

06:42.720 --> 06:47.600
And sea level is currently rising around 3.6mm a year.

06:47.600 --> 06:52.480
So basic physics tells us a hotter climate should be raising sea levels, as we've seen

06:52.480 --> 06:54.600
it do in the past.

06:54.600 --> 06:59.440
In fact, those who dispute that really need to explain how it's possible that warmer

06:59.440 --> 07:05.440
water and melting ice would not cause sea level to rise, but they do raise a legitimate

07:05.440 --> 07:06.440
question.

07:06.440 --> 07:12.800
If sea level really is rising at over 3mm a year, how come we can't see it in old

07:12.800 --> 07:14.940
photos?

07:14.940 --> 07:19.800
This photo has been passed around Facebook and Twitter for years, showing, apparently,

07:19.800 --> 07:25.560
a rise of 0.0cm in sea levels, in other words zero.

07:25.560 --> 07:31.320
If whoever produced this photo is measuring sea level rise to the nearest 0.1cm, that's

07:31.320 --> 07:36.460
a millimetre, it means that he's got eyesight keen enough to determine that the level of

07:36.460 --> 07:42.740
water on the right is less than half a millimetre higher than the level of water on the left.

07:42.740 --> 07:47.420
Well done to whoever managed that, but that isn't science.

07:47.420 --> 07:50.280
That's called doing your own research.

07:50.280 --> 07:54.600
For a start, there's a half metre tidal variation at Sydney Harbour, where this photo

07:54.600 --> 07:55.920
was taken.

07:55.920 --> 08:00.060
So the photo on the left could have been taken at high tide, and the photo on the right at

08:00.060 --> 08:04.660
low tide, meaning sea level has risen about half a metre.

08:04.660 --> 08:09.380
There's no evidence of exactly when during the tidal cycle the photo was taken.

08:09.380 --> 08:14.140
Facebook users can't even agree on the year the photo was taken, and as is pretty

08:14.140 --> 08:18.720
obvious, even the wave height varies between the two pictures.

08:18.720 --> 08:23.420
But it's an interesting example of what happens when you do your own research.

08:23.420 --> 08:28.160
In the do your own research world there's no need for accurate measurements and accurate

08:28.160 --> 08:30.700
recorded data collection.

08:30.700 --> 08:35.300
In the science world, researchers have been measuring sea level rise in Sydney Harbour

08:35.300 --> 08:40.340
since 1886, in fact right here at Fort Denison.

08:40.340 --> 08:45.060
Before sophisticated instruments came along, they used a simple measuring rule inside a

08:45.060 --> 08:49.220
stilling well, which minimised the impact of waves.

08:49.220 --> 08:54.760
In the 1960s they measured more accurately with microwave radar scanners, but these were

08:54.760 --> 09:00.380
fixed on land, so it was hard to determine whether the sea was rising or the land was

09:00.380 --> 09:01.940
sinking.

09:01.940 --> 09:07.020
So these older measurements now have to be adjusted to take account of land movement.

09:07.020 --> 09:12.180
It was only in the 1990s that satellites were able to measure sea level rise with millimetre

09:12.180 --> 09:17.020
precision irrespective of changes in land elevation.

09:17.020 --> 09:22.100
According to this study, the sea level at Fort Denison has risen around 0.9mm a year

09:22.100 --> 09:31.280
over the last 100 years, and around 0.63mm a year before that, going back to 1886.

09:31.280 --> 09:35.380
Of course, I'm sure those who thought this photo is how sea level is measured are already

09:35.380 --> 09:42.560
furiously typing posts saying 0.6 to 0.9mm a year, that's tiny.

09:42.560 --> 09:47.720
But before you hit the send button, let me first say, I'm delighted you now accept

09:47.720 --> 09:53.220
actual scientific measurements instead of do your own research Facebook memes, because

09:53.220 --> 09:57.780
clearly that 0.0cm claim was nonsense.

09:57.780 --> 10:02.740
And secondly, I haven't quite finished, we have to follow the science further.

10:02.740 --> 10:09.440
These are past sea level rises in Sydney Harbour, and like everywhere else, the rise is accelerating.

10:09.440 --> 10:14.500
So of course, past sea level rise is a lot less than current sea level rise.

10:14.500 --> 10:19.660
Also, Sydney Harbour is part of an area where sea levels are rising a lot slower than other

10:19.660 --> 10:23.780
parts of the world, like regions of the United States and Canada.

10:23.780 --> 10:27.620
As if sea level around the US could somehow be different than it is in the rest of the

10:27.620 --> 10:28.620
world.

10:28.620 --> 10:33.840
Yes, I know, if you do your own research in a bathtub, ocean water should rise at exactly

10:33.840 --> 10:36.040
the same rate everywhere.

10:36.040 --> 10:41.220
In the science world, even if you believe the rate of rise ought to be evenly distributed,

10:41.220 --> 10:44.540
you still have to measure it and find out.

10:44.540 --> 10:48.820
And when all the measurements are collected all over the world, this is the picture that

10:48.820 --> 10:50.160
emerges.

10:50.160 --> 10:56.120
The areas in red are where sea level is rising fastest, in blue it's rising slowest.

10:56.120 --> 11:00.760
Anyway, now that we've seen what the rate of sea level rise was in the past, and what

11:00.760 --> 11:06.240
it is now, according to measurements rather than guesses, let's move on to what it's going

11:06.240 --> 11:08.340
to do in the future.

11:08.340 --> 11:10.720
Who can we get that information from?

11:10.720 --> 11:13.680
Of course, an actor and theatre technician.

11:13.680 --> 11:14.680
He should know.

11:14.680 --> 11:18.040
Let's see now, 3mm a year, that means in 100 years...

11:18.040 --> 11:20.680
No, you can't work it out in your head, Bill.

11:20.680 --> 11:25.020
It's not as if you can simply multiply 3 by 100.

11:25.020 --> 11:29.960
These are just a couple of the equations required to estimate thermosteric sea level rise, which

11:29.960 --> 11:33.820
is the rise due to the expansion of warmer water.

11:33.820 --> 11:39.000
Then on top of that, you need to apply calculus to work out the response of sea level to past

11:39.000 --> 11:44.480
temperature rise, and a whole load more measurements and calculations to work out how much ice

11:44.480 --> 11:49.380
will melt from Greenland and thousands of glaciers in response to future atmospheric

11:49.380 --> 11:50.760
and ocean temperature rises.

11:50.760 --> 11:53.240
I wish I had a science guy here to check my numbers.

11:53.240 --> 11:56.600
Oh god, you're not really going to just multiply 3 by 100, are you?

11:56.600 --> 11:57.600
We'll be up to...

11:57.600 --> 11:59.840
Don't say 300, don't say 300.

11:59.840 --> 12:00.840
300mm.

12:00.840 --> 12:01.840
No!

12:01.840 --> 12:03.760
Boy, that's 11.8 inches.

12:03.760 --> 12:04.960
That's almost a foot.

12:04.960 --> 12:09.920
Seriously, this is why science should be left to the professionals, not YouTubers who've

12:09.920 --> 12:15.240
never studied science past junior high school and do their own research.

12:15.240 --> 12:19.620
By the way, I've covered this claim by Bill Whittle before in another video, as well as

12:19.620 --> 12:23.920
a few of the other myths and facts about sea level rise, but I thought it worth bringing

12:23.920 --> 12:26.120
them all together into this video.

12:26.120 --> 12:32.080
Now, I'm sure Bill Whittle is very talented in the field he chose to study, which was

12:32.080 --> 12:37.280
theatre, and I'm happy to admit that's a subject I know nothing about.

12:37.280 --> 12:42.600
But that doesn't qualify him to calculate future glacial melt, ocean temperature profiles

12:42.600 --> 12:47.260
and thermosteric expansion, as he clearly showed.

12:47.260 --> 12:52.100
And Bill isn't kidding, he really does think he's worked out future sea level rise.

12:52.100 --> 12:56.800
I did study science, and even I can't work all that stuff out.

12:56.800 --> 13:02.460
To show why you can't simply multiply 3 by 100, let's start with the easy part, the difference

13:02.460 --> 13:05.980
between a linear curve and a geometric curve.

13:05.980 --> 13:10.660
In other words, the difference between velocity and acceleration.

13:10.660 --> 13:15.180
If I measure the velocity of a stone a fifth of a second after I drop it from the Leaning

13:15.180 --> 13:21.120
Tower of Pisa, its velocity would be around 1.96 metres a second.

13:21.120 --> 13:26.140
Since the top of the tower is 57 metres high, then according to Bill Whittle's formula of

13:26.140 --> 13:35.140
simple arithmetic, it should take 29 seconds before it hits the ground.

13:35.140 --> 13:37.420
That's an awfully long time.

13:37.420 --> 13:44.500
So how come in real life it can be measured and it only takes about 3.4 seconds?

13:44.500 --> 13:49.700
The answer is that it didn't stay at a constant velocity of 1.96 metres per second during

13:49.700 --> 13:53.200
the entire fall, it accelerated.

13:53.200 --> 13:56.900
This was first discovered by Galileo over 400 years ago.

13:56.900 --> 14:01.820
No, there's no evidence he dropped anything from the Leaning Tower of Pisa, but he did

14:01.820 --> 14:06.620
set up a clever experiment to measure the acceleration of a rolling ball.

14:06.620 --> 14:12.020
And thanks to this set of equations, we can work out exactly what speed it will be and

14:12.020 --> 14:16.780
what distance it will have covered over a given period of time.

14:16.780 --> 14:20.980
The same goes for a linear versus geometric growth.

14:20.980 --> 14:25.580
If it was a simple case of projecting a straight line into the future, then anyone with a fifth

14:25.580 --> 14:30.120
grade science education could do that with a ruler and pencil.

14:30.120 --> 14:35.760
But a geometric curve, which is an acceleration, is more complicated.

14:35.760 --> 14:40.120
Scientists have to figure out not just what the rate of melt and thermosteric expansion

14:40.120 --> 14:45.520
is, but they also have to work out the rate at which it's accelerating.

14:45.520 --> 14:48.560
So what have real scientists found?

14:48.560 --> 14:53.280
If you get your science from popular media, then the conclusions of scientists are rather

14:53.280 --> 14:54.280
confusing.

14:54.280 --> 15:01.720
If Greenland broke up and melted, or if half of Greenland and half of West Antarctica broke

15:01.720 --> 15:06.440
up and melted, this is what would happen to the sea level in Florida.

15:06.440 --> 15:10.320
So we were told sea levels would rise and we'd have to evacuate the coasts.

15:10.320 --> 15:12.680
These are two opposite ends of the spectrum.

15:12.680 --> 15:16.080
This guy seems to think that scientists were predicting that we'd have to evacuate the

15:16.080 --> 15:20.520
coasts by 2018, presumably all of them.

15:20.520 --> 15:25.320
And since we haven't evacuated all the coasts, he concludes that the science must be wrong.

15:25.320 --> 15:30.200
And this guy doesn't say when these huge sea level rises will happen, so a lot of people

15:30.200 --> 15:34.280
assume that Al Gore was talking about this century.

15:34.280 --> 15:39.680
Now it's true that studies show sea level will rise by this much if and when Greenland's

15:39.680 --> 15:45.400
ice melts, but they conclude that's many hundreds of years into the future.

15:45.400 --> 15:50.480
Not a good thing, obviously, but the timescale needs to be made clear.

15:50.480 --> 15:56.540
So let's get our predictions from scientific studies rather than videos and movies.

15:56.540 --> 16:01.160
Researchers use two completely different methods to work out how far and how fast sea levels

16:01.160 --> 16:03.600
will rise into the future.

16:03.600 --> 16:07.440
One method is to look at where sea level was when the Earth was at the same temperature

16:07.440 --> 16:11.340
in the past, taking account of eustatic changes.

16:11.340 --> 16:16.840
The other is to calculate the extra volume of water from thermosteric expansion and ice

16:16.840 --> 16:18.020
melt.

16:18.020 --> 16:24.920
How fast sea levels continue to rise obviously depends on how much CO2 we pump into the atmosphere.

16:24.920 --> 16:28.980
So there are different scenarios for different outcomes.

16:28.980 --> 16:34.360
Obviously if we follow the do your own research path where CO2 doesn't cause warming and even

16:34.360 --> 16:38.020
if it does cause warming that'll be a good thing and even if it's a bad thing there isn't

16:38.020 --> 16:42.080
anything we can do about it and even if there was something we can do about it it'll probably

16:42.080 --> 16:48.840
cost money, that path, then CO2 will continue to rise at the same rate, radiative forcing

16:48.840 --> 16:56.880
will be around 8.5W per square metre and sea level will rise around 12ft by 2100.

16:56.880 --> 17:02.700
But assuming some action is taken to drastically curb CO2 output under the most likely scenario

17:02.700 --> 17:08.800
called RCP4.5 then we'll see a rise of about 3ft.

17:08.800 --> 17:13.380
And of course sea level won't stop rising just because we hit that magical date with

17:13.380 --> 17:15.400
two zeros in it.

17:15.400 --> 17:21.960
Even if we reduce worldwide carbon emissions to zero by 2100 temperature will keep rising

17:21.960 --> 17:25.560
because of what's called positive feedback.

17:25.560 --> 17:31.500
So it'll take decades before the Earth reaches its new stable equilibrium temperature which

17:31.500 --> 17:39.940
will be over 3°C under RCP4.5 that's about 6°F.

17:39.940 --> 17:43.380
Researchers have found that the last time the Earth hit that kind of temperature during

17:43.380 --> 17:50.980
the Pliocene more than 2.5 million years ago sea levels were 16-62ft higher.

17:50.980 --> 17:53.540
But it's not going to happen overnight.

17:53.540 --> 17:58.300
If you fill a swimming pool with cold water on a warm day it takes time for the water

17:58.300 --> 17:59.900
to warm up.

17:59.900 --> 18:05.460
And if you put an ice sculpture under the hot sun it takes a long time for it to melt.

18:05.460 --> 18:11.540
So even when the Earth reaches its new equilibrium temperature perhaps 6°F higher than it is

18:11.540 --> 18:16.540
today sea level will keep rising for hundreds of years.

18:16.540 --> 18:22.160
That means the lives of people two, four or even ten generations into the future will

18:22.160 --> 18:27.320
depend on the decisions we take now.

18:27.320 --> 18:33.480
Now three feet may not seem like much up against a 20ft tower or a cliff face.

18:33.480 --> 18:37.040
That's because these structures are rising vertically.

18:37.040 --> 18:42.000
However along most of the shoreline the land is sloping or even flat.

18:42.000 --> 18:48.800
So there the three feet rise would send seawater dozens or even hundreds of feet inland.

18:48.800 --> 18:54.180
And unfortunately flat coastal land and estuaries are precisely where we've decided to build

18:54.180 --> 18:59.140
most of our expensive and densely populated infrastructure.

18:59.140 --> 19:02.660
But wasn't New York supposed to be already underwater by now?

19:02.660 --> 19:06.600
I've been getting comments on the channel from people who really believe this was a

19:06.600 --> 19:08.700
scientific prediction.

19:08.700 --> 19:14.900
Apparently in 1988 James Hansen said Lower Manhattan would be underwater by 2018.

19:14.900 --> 19:21.620
Wait, no, Hansen said all of Manhattan will be underwater by 2018 and that's supported

19:21.620 --> 19:25.340
by an impeccable source, a blog.

19:25.340 --> 19:29.380
And as long as we're making stuff up, let's say his prediction was that the whole of New

19:29.380 --> 19:32.620
York will be underwater by 2018.

19:32.620 --> 19:38.540
Better yet, he predicted that the entire city of New York would vanish overnight.

19:38.540 --> 19:42.300
And where did he make this prediction that Lower Manhattan or Manhattan or the whole

19:42.300 --> 19:48.020
of New York would be underwater by midnight on December 31st 2017?

19:48.020 --> 19:49.700
Why it's all over the web.

19:49.700 --> 19:53.460
Where people go to do their own research.

19:53.460 --> 20:00.340
So if this really was a scientific prediction, then why isn't the West Side Highway underwater?

20:00.340 --> 20:04.260
To bust the myth, we first have to track down the source.

20:04.260 --> 20:09.220
Let's ask someone who always gives his source but never properly reads or fact checks it.

20:09.220 --> 20:12.700
Here's another James Hansen forecast from 1988.

20:12.700 --> 20:19.300
He predicted that within 30 years, i.e. this year, Lower Manhattan would be underwater.

20:19.300 --> 20:20.860
Good old Tony Heller.

20:20.860 --> 20:23.460
So this wasn't a scientific study at all.

20:23.460 --> 20:27.300
It was speculation by Hansen in a magazine.

20:27.300 --> 20:28.540
Or was it?

20:28.540 --> 20:32.500
No, turns out Salon magazine never even talked to Hansen.

20:32.500 --> 20:37.220
They interviewed a journalist, Bob Rice, who was recalling a conversation he had had with

20:37.220 --> 20:41.980
Hansen 12 or 13 years earlier for an upcoming book.

20:41.980 --> 20:47.420
As Rice remembered it, they were in Hansen's office in Lower Manhattan and Rice told Salon

20:47.420 --> 20:48.420
magazine this.

20:48.540 --> 20:52.900
I went over to the window with him and looked down on Broadway in New York City and said,

20:52.900 --> 20:56.460
if what you're saying about the greenhouse effect is true, is anything going to look

20:56.460 --> 20:58.860
different down there in 20 years?

20:58.860 --> 21:05.260
Hansen said that the West Side Highway, which runs along the Hudson River, will be underwater.

21:05.260 --> 21:08.940
Tony Heller didn't find this Salon magazine interview himself.

21:08.940 --> 21:11.260
He copied it off the blogosphere.

21:11.260 --> 21:15.660
It had been circulating ever since a blogger called Anthony Watts discovered the article

21:15.660 --> 21:17.740
in 2009.

21:17.740 --> 21:21.740
As we've seen, there were lots of embellishments and changes along the way.

21:21.740 --> 21:26.980
So in 1988, he predicted that Lower Manhattan would be underwater within 30 years.

21:26.980 --> 21:27.980
Thirty years?

21:27.980 --> 21:33.260
I thought Tony Heller had just read the article out loud and Rice had said it was 20 years.

21:33.260 --> 21:35.420
So why did Tony Heller change it?

21:35.420 --> 21:39.800
Well, it goes all the way back to that first blog by Anthony Watts.

21:39.800 --> 21:42.180
He got his sums wrong.

21:42.180 --> 21:47.500
Since the magazine interview was in 2001 and Rice said his interview with Hansen had been

21:47.500 --> 21:52.780
12 to 13 years earlier, that would mean the prediction was made around 1988.

21:52.780 --> 22:00.660
1988 plus 20 years makes … too slow, Bill … 2008.

22:00.660 --> 22:08.540
Unfortunately, when Watts added 20 to 1988, he mistakenly got 2018.

22:08.540 --> 22:13.100
So that date was copied and pasted by other bloggers.

22:13.100 --> 22:16.980
When it was Tony Heller's turn to copy the myth, he could see the dates didn't

22:16.980 --> 22:18.180
add up.

22:18.180 --> 22:23.500
But the first rule of doing your own research is never question the blogosphere.

22:23.500 --> 22:27.160
Once a myth is set in stone, you can't correct it.

22:27.160 --> 22:32.380
So Tony decided instead to change the time period that was spelled out in the magazine

22:32.380 --> 22:35.380
that he'd just read out loud.

22:35.380 --> 22:40.780
And that allowed him to dutifully follow the line that Hansen's prediction was for 2018.

22:40.780 --> 22:46.580
It's a classic case of changing the evidence to fit the conclusion, even when you know

22:46.580 --> 22:48.060
the conclusion is wrong.

22:48.060 --> 22:51.860
Don't you just love how the blogosphere works?

22:51.860 --> 22:56.500
The funny thing is, Hansen didn't say 20 years or 30 years.

22:56.500 --> 23:02.340
Despite being copied on the blogosphere hundreds of times, no one thought to check with Hansen

23:02.340 --> 23:07.520
to confirm that's what he actually said, or check with Rice's book to see if Rice

23:07.520 --> 23:11.160
had remembered the conversation correctly.

23:11.160 --> 23:13.520
As it turned out, he hadn't.

23:13.520 --> 23:17.240
Rice later admitted he was being interviewed on the telephone, and he didn't have his

23:17.240 --> 23:20.440
notes, so he got the details wrong.

23:20.440 --> 23:24.760
After checking with his own book, he said his question was what the view would be like

23:24.760 --> 23:29.480
outside the window in 40 years with doubled CO2.

23:29.480 --> 23:31.800
So this is what's in the book.

23:31.800 --> 23:36.120
Hansen's own recollection of the conversation was exactly the same as the book that Rice

23:36.120 --> 23:41.400
had asked him to speculate on changes that might happen in New York City in 40 years

23:41.400 --> 23:45.600
assuming CO2 doubled in amount.

23:45.600 --> 23:51.400
Double CO2 concentration means a doubling from pre-industrial levels of around 265 parts

23:51.400 --> 23:55.720
per million to 530 parts per million.

23:55.720 --> 24:01.840
Rice might be forgiven for thinking that figure would be reached by 2028, because in 1988

24:01.840 --> 24:07.440
CO2 emissions were rising uncontrollably, and without governments agreeing to curb the

24:07.440 --> 24:11.720
emissions, they were on the path of this black line.

24:11.720 --> 24:17.680
But thanks to the Kyoto Protocol, CO2 is now at around 415 parts per million following

24:17.680 --> 24:19.100
the red line.

24:19.100 --> 24:26.180
So it looks like we'll hit the double CO2 concentration point around 2060 to 2070.

24:26.180 --> 24:31.820
If every nation adheres to Paris climate agreement targets, then a doubling of CO2 concentration

24:31.820 --> 24:34.860
could be pushed back even further.

24:34.860 --> 24:39.420
So now that we understand what the question was, was Hansen's answer correct?

24:39.420 --> 24:44.480
Well of course we don't know until CO2 concentration doubles.

24:44.480 --> 24:49.640
My sources are in the video description and they suggest that at the time CO2 concentration

24:49.640 --> 24:55.620
doubles, sea level will have risen about 0.2 to 0.6 metres.

24:55.620 --> 24:58.560
Is that enough to cover the west side highway?

24:58.560 --> 25:02.840
Well no good looking at this highway Cam, because this isn't the west side highway

25:02.840 --> 25:04.960
Hansen was talking about.

25:04.960 --> 25:06.760
This is the new highway.

25:06.760 --> 25:13.960
It was built on top of the old highway that Hansen was pointing to in 1988 or 1989.

25:13.960 --> 25:18.520
I don't know the elevation of that highway, so I don't know if the sea will have covered

25:18.520 --> 25:20.960
some parts of it, or all of it.

25:20.960 --> 25:26.360
Unless someone does a proper peer reviewed study, then this isn't a scientific study,

25:26.360 --> 25:30.200
it's pointless and groundless speculation.

25:30.200 --> 25:35.360
Of course decades later a doubling of CO2 concentration will very likely lead to a rise

25:35.360 --> 25:41.280
in sea level of several metres according to real scientific studies, more than enough

25:41.280 --> 25:44.380
to cover most of Lower Manhattan.

25:44.380 --> 25:48.940
This is what it would look like when sea level rise is just 8 feet.

25:48.940 --> 25:51.560
But that isn't the prediction Hansen made.

25:51.560 --> 25:57.480
He didn't say a doubling of CO2 concentration will cause the west side highway to be inundated,

25:57.480 --> 26:02.980
he said the west side highway will be inundated when CO2 levels double.

26:02.980 --> 26:06.480
Not just part of it, and not just some of the time.

26:06.480 --> 26:10.160
And that seems to contradict most scientific projections.

26:10.160 --> 26:15.120
It emphasises my point that scientists shouldn't indulge in speculation without reference to

26:15.120 --> 26:21.240
a proper scientific study, and why Rice shouldn't invite or publish that kind of speculation

26:21.240 --> 26:25.320
in a book that's supposed to be reporting the facts about climate change.

26:25.320 --> 26:29.320
James Hansen is a great scientist, but he's not an oracle.

26:29.320 --> 26:34.760
A scientist is only as good as the research that supports his conclusions.

26:34.760 --> 26:40.480
If there isn't any supporting research, published in a respected peer reviewed scientific journal,

26:40.480 --> 26:46.240
then proclamations count for nothing, no matter the status of the scientist making them.

26:46.240 --> 26:51.920
If you want to know what the scientific predictions are, read the scientific literature.

26:51.920 --> 26:56.200
The date the west side highway, or any other piece of coastal infrastructure, actually

26:56.200 --> 27:02.880
gets submerged is really not that relevant, because houses, highways, hospitals and railways

27:02.880 --> 27:06.240
will be affected long before they are physically inundated.

27:06.240 --> 27:11.560
Venice, for example, isn't yet under water, but floods are becoming more common with each

27:11.560 --> 27:15.720
storm surge and each exceptionally high tide.

27:15.720 --> 27:20.680
coastal areas and islands are increasingly having to deal with storm surges and salination,

27:20.680 --> 27:25.600
which is why people are moving long before the water actually permanently covers their

27:25.600 --> 27:26.600
homes.

27:26.600 --> 27:32.240
I've looked at this in my video on the Maldives, busting yet another vlogger who did his own

27:32.240 --> 27:39.200
research by reading spurious tabloid newspapers rather than scientific studies.

27:39.200 --> 27:43.680
So if you're going to do your own research, first of all understand that geophysics is

27:43.680 --> 27:48.480
a lot more complicated than just multiplying one number by another.

27:48.480 --> 27:54.160
Secondly, if you want to do your own research to find out what scientific predictions are,

27:54.160 --> 28:00.280
then read the scientific predictions, like the studies I've listed in the video description.

28:00.280 --> 28:06.760
Don't just trust blogs, books, tweets and tabloids to tell you, because here's the shocker,

28:06.760 --> 28:09.840
they aren't always accurate.

28:09.840 --> 28:15.400
My thanks to all those who've been donating to this charity in order to support my channel.

28:15.400 --> 28:20.560
Unlike many YouTubers and bloggers who are pushing their own junk research, I don't do

28:20.560 --> 28:23.280
this for money and I don't ask for money.

28:23.280 --> 28:27.920
I've had trouble naming the charity as the beneficiary of monetisation of this channel,

28:27.920 --> 28:33.400
which is why it's still ad-free, but your generous contributions alone have now raised

28:33.400 --> 28:37.560
nearly $200,000 for Health in Harmony.

28:37.560 --> 28:42.160
Health in Harmony provides healthcare to communities near rainforests in exchange for

28:42.160 --> 28:47.960
an end to logging, because the reason so many people cut down trees in this area is because

28:47.960 --> 28:50.580
healthcare is unaffordable.

28:50.580 --> 28:56.320
So it's a charity that saves lives, improves health and helps preserve the rainforest,

28:56.320 --> 29:00.460
not to mention that your donation will encourage me to keep my channel going.

29:00.460 --> 29:04.360
So it's a win, win, win, win.

29:04.360 --> 29:05.280
You tired of winning yet?
