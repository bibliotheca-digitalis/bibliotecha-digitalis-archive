1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,280
For those who are skeptical about the rise in sea level caused by global warming, here

2
00:00:05,280 --> 00:00:07,520
are some scientific predictions that were made.

3
00:00:07,520 --> 00:00:10,760
So we were told sea levels would rise and we'd have to evacuate the coasts.

4
00:00:10,760 --> 00:00:15,280
Let's take a look here, Sydney Harbor, 140 years.

5
00:00:15,280 --> 00:00:22,160
He predicted that within 30 years, i.e. this year, lower Manhattan would be under water.

6
00:00:22,160 --> 00:00:25,360
And here's how scientists measure that sea level rise.

7
00:00:25,360 --> 00:00:26,360
Just there.

8
00:00:26,360 --> 00:00:28,800
It's going up by about a millimeter.

9
00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:29,800
Rising sea level.

10
00:00:29,800 --> 00:00:30,800
You got it?

11
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:31,800
I've got it.

12
00:00:31,800 --> 00:00:32,800
Three mil.

13
00:00:32,800 --> 00:00:33,800
Well, no prizes for guessing.

14
00:00:33,800 --> 00:00:39,440
This isn't how they measure sea level rise and these aren't scientific predictions.

15
00:00:39,440 --> 00:00:44,000
They're just what bloggers and pundits think scientific predictions and measurements are

16
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:49,680
because when they do their own research, they don't check scientific studies to find out.

17
00:00:49,680 --> 00:00:54,520
They just get their information from other TV shows, books, newspaper columnists and

18
00:00:54,520 --> 00:00:55,520
bloggers.

19
00:00:56,080 --> 00:01:01,520
We'll take a look at the real scientific predictions and how sea level rise is being measured later

20
00:01:01,520 --> 00:01:03,800
in the video.

21
00:01:03,800 --> 00:01:05,280
Why do the critics do it?

22
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:11,200
Well, of course, it's a very old tactic, taking a leaf out of the creationist manual.

23
00:01:11,200 --> 00:01:15,080
Invent your own science, create your own scientist, even.

24
00:01:15,080 --> 00:01:17,280
Make his claims as stupid as possible.

25
00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:22,680
I think what you must remember is that as true scientists, we are constantly searching

26
00:01:22,680 --> 00:01:23,680
for evidence.

27
00:01:23,680 --> 00:01:27,680
Prove that which we already believe to be truth.

28
00:01:27,680 --> 00:01:32,280
And then amaze your audience with your skill in demolishing them.

29
00:01:32,280 --> 00:01:37,540
So if the science critics aren't explaining what the science says, where do you go?

30
00:01:37,540 --> 00:01:41,760
The same place real scientists go when they want to look at the latest discoveries in

31
00:01:41,760 --> 00:01:46,120
their field, respected peer-reviewed scientific journals.

32
00:01:46,120 --> 00:01:50,420
And if you find these rather daunting, then get your information from reputable science

33
00:01:50,420 --> 00:01:55,620
media where these studies are accurately reported and cited.

34
00:01:55,620 --> 00:02:00,500
Now you may not trust or believe the studies, maybe you think they're part of a huge worldwide

35
00:02:00,500 --> 00:02:06,140
conspiracy, but at least you'll know what they actually say instead of relying on spurious

36
00:02:06,140 --> 00:02:11,100
blogs and news pundits to misinform you about what they say.

37
00:02:11,100 --> 00:02:14,820
Before we look at the fallacies, let's start with the basics.

38
00:02:14,820 --> 00:02:20,620
Why are sea levels rising and expected to rise further as the Earth heats up?

39
00:02:20,620 --> 00:02:25,900
The most obvious reason is that higher temperatures mean more ice is melting, which I'm sure makes

40
00:02:25,900 --> 00:02:29,020
perfect sense even to people who never studied science.

41
00:02:29,020 --> 00:02:33,540
How long will it take for the sea level to rise two feet?

42
00:02:33,540 --> 00:02:38,180
Think about it, if your ice cube melts in your glass, it doesn't overflow, it's displacement.

43
00:02:38,180 --> 00:02:41,380
This is the thing, some of the things that they're talking about, mathematically and

44
00:02:41,380 --> 00:02:43,580
scientifically don't make sense.

45
00:02:43,620 --> 00:02:48,380
OK, they don't make sense to one person who never studied science, so for Congressman

46
00:02:48,380 --> 00:02:53,420
Stockman's benefit I'll explain the physics in words of one syllable, because it really

47
00:02:53,420 --> 00:02:55,540
is that simple.

48
00:02:55,540 --> 00:03:01,540
Land, ice, melt, fill, rise.

49
00:03:01,540 --> 00:03:04,820
Think about it, if your ice cube melts in your glass, it doesn't overflow.

50
00:03:04,820 --> 00:03:09,940
But the great thing about basic physics is that you can do a lot of the experiments yourself.

51
00:03:09,940 --> 00:03:15,300
Put a draining board to represent Greenland over a glass, put some ice on it to represent

52
00:03:15,300 --> 00:03:18,980
Greenland's ice cap, and what do you get?

53
00:03:18,980 --> 00:03:23,060
Ice, melt, fill, rise.

54
00:03:23,060 --> 00:03:27,060
The real lesson from this is that any time a politician tells you he's spotted a flaw

55
00:03:27,060 --> 00:03:32,500
in the laws of physics that scientists have overlooked, put your money on the scientists

56
00:03:32,500 --> 00:03:35,540
knowing something he doesn't.

57
00:03:35,540 --> 00:03:39,860
Like all good science, this melt isn't just obvious in theory, it can be measured

58
00:03:39,860 --> 00:03:42,260
and quantified in practice.

59
00:03:42,260 --> 00:03:47,580
For example, a satellite system called GRACE constantly records the mass of ice on top

60
00:03:47,580 --> 00:03:51,140
of Greenland using a gravitometer.

61
00:03:51,140 --> 00:03:56,460
Research has found that Greenland has been losing around 255 billion tonnes of ice every

62
00:03:56,460 --> 00:03:57,460
year.

63
00:03:57,460 --> 00:04:01,940
That means the amount of ice lost through melting and ablation, minus the amount gained

64
00:04:01,940 --> 00:04:04,220
through precipitation.

65
00:04:04,260 --> 00:04:08,700
Green glaciers are also contributing a huge amount to sea level rise.

66
00:04:08,700 --> 00:04:15,300
There are about 200,000 glaciers worldwide, covering roughly 10% of the Earth's surface.

67
00:04:15,300 --> 00:04:21,980
Outside of Greenland, glaciers are losing some 267 billion tonnes of ice every year,

68
00:04:21,980 --> 00:04:29,700
contributing to a rise of about 0.7mm in sea levels annually, 20% of the total rise.

69
00:04:29,700 --> 00:04:35,940
The other half of the rise, less well-known, is the expansion of water as it gets warmer.

70
00:04:35,940 --> 00:04:39,840
The fact that the oceans are getting warmer has been directly measured, and the fact that

71
00:04:39,840 --> 00:04:44,700
warming water expands is another well-known principle of physics.

72
00:04:44,700 --> 00:04:49,860
And again, you can actually do this experiment yourself to be sure it's not just a conspiracy

73
00:04:49,860 --> 00:04:54,100
by 18th century scientists who first discovered it.

74
00:04:54,100 --> 00:04:56,660
Just follow the instructions.

75
00:04:56,660 --> 00:04:58,380
There are a couple of other factors.

76
00:04:58,380 --> 00:05:00,340
One is terrestrial storage.

77
00:05:00,340 --> 00:05:06,780
So during extensive flooding in Pakistan in 2010, sea level actually fell temporarily.

78
00:05:06,780 --> 00:05:10,560
But these ups and downs don't change the long-term picture.

79
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:17,140
And sea level is also affected by eustatic changes, movement of the land rising and falling.

80
00:05:17,140 --> 00:05:22,220
A failure to understand this eustatic movement has often led to fallacious news reports from

81
00:05:22,220 --> 00:05:33,300
Reuters and others claiming ridiculously high rises in sea level because in this case

82
00:05:33,300 --> 00:05:39,980
the reporter was unaware that the crustal plate on which she's standing has been subsiding.

83
00:05:39,980 --> 00:05:44,660
Scientists on the other hand factor these eustatic changes into their measurements.

84
00:05:44,660 --> 00:05:50,120
The amount of melting ice from Greenland and glaciers outside Greenland is accelerating

85
00:05:50,120 --> 00:05:52,360
at the high end of predictions.

86
00:05:52,360 --> 00:05:57,400
And this, combined with a more rapid expansion of warmer water, has led to an acceleration

87
00:05:57,400 --> 00:06:01,120
in sea level rise over the last few decades.

88
00:06:01,120 --> 00:06:07,340
If we go back to the end of the last glaciation, after a 400ft rise due to melting ice sheets,

89
00:06:07,340 --> 00:06:12,660
there hasn't been much of a change in sea level for the last 3,700 years.

90
00:06:12,660 --> 00:06:17,760
This can be determined by taking sediment cores from coastal zones, dating coral growth

91
00:06:17,760 --> 00:06:23,380
rates and other techniques that, put together, show a picture of a very small and steady

92
00:06:23,380 --> 00:06:27,040
rise of less than a millimetre a year.

93
00:06:27,040 --> 00:06:32,600
But during the 20th century, when global temperatures went up significantly, sea level rise more

94
00:06:32,600 --> 00:06:42,720
than doubled from 0.8mm a year to 1.9mm a year, then accelerated again to 3.1mm a year.

95
00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:47,600
And sea level is currently rising around 3.6mm a year.

96
00:06:47,600 --> 00:06:52,480
So basic physics tells us a hotter climate should be raising sea levels, as we've seen

97
00:06:52,480 --> 00:06:54,600
it do in the past.

98
00:06:54,600 --> 00:06:59,440
In fact, those who dispute that really need to explain how it's possible that warmer

99
00:06:59,440 --> 00:07:05,440
water and melting ice would not cause sea level to rise, but they do raise a legitimate

100
00:07:05,440 --> 00:07:06,440
question.

101
00:07:06,440 --> 00:07:12,800
If sea level really is rising at over 3mm a year, how come we can't see it in old

102
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:14,940
photos?

103
00:07:14,940 --> 00:07:19,800
This photo has been passed around Facebook and Twitter for years, showing, apparently,

104
00:07:19,800 --> 00:07:25,560
a rise of 0.0cm in sea levels, in other words zero.

105
00:07:25,560 --> 00:07:31,320
If whoever produced this photo is measuring sea level rise to the nearest 0.1cm, that's

106
00:07:31,320 --> 00:07:36,460
a millimetre, it means that he's got eyesight keen enough to determine that the level of

107
00:07:36,460 --> 00:07:42,740
water on the right is less than half a millimetre higher than the level of water on the left.

108
00:07:42,740 --> 00:07:47,420
Well done to whoever managed that, but that isn't science.

109
00:07:47,420 --> 00:07:50,280
That's called doing your own research.

110
00:07:50,280 --> 00:07:54,600
For a start, there's a half metre tidal variation at Sydney Harbour, where this photo

111
00:07:54,600 --> 00:07:55,920
was taken.

112
00:07:55,920 --> 00:08:00,060
So the photo on the left could have been taken at high tide, and the photo on the right at

113
00:08:00,060 --> 00:08:04,660
low tide, meaning sea level has risen about half a metre.

114
00:08:04,660 --> 00:08:09,380
There's no evidence of exactly when during the tidal cycle the photo was taken.

115
00:08:09,380 --> 00:08:14,140
Facebook users can't even agree on the year the photo was taken, and as is pretty

116
00:08:14,140 --> 00:08:18,720
obvious, even the wave height varies between the two pictures.

117
00:08:18,720 --> 00:08:23,420
But it's an interesting example of what happens when you do your own research.

118
00:08:23,420 --> 00:08:28,160
In the do your own research world there's no need for accurate measurements and accurate

119
00:08:28,160 --> 00:08:30,700
recorded data collection.

120
00:08:30,700 --> 00:08:35,300
In the science world, researchers have been measuring sea level rise in Sydney Harbour

121
00:08:35,300 --> 00:08:40,340
since 1886, in fact right here at Fort Denison.

122
00:08:40,340 --> 00:08:45,060
Before sophisticated instruments came along, they used a simple measuring rule inside a

123
00:08:45,060 --> 00:08:49,220
stilling well, which minimised the impact of waves.

124
00:08:49,220 --> 00:08:54,760
In the 1960s they measured more accurately with microwave radar scanners, but these were

125
00:08:54,760 --> 00:09:00,380
fixed on land, so it was hard to determine whether the sea was rising or the land was

126
00:09:00,380 --> 00:09:01,940
sinking.

127
00:09:01,940 --> 00:09:07,020
So these older measurements now have to be adjusted to take account of land movement.

128
00:09:07,020 --> 00:09:12,180
It was only in the 1990s that satellites were able to measure sea level rise with millimetre

129
00:09:12,180 --> 00:09:17,020
precision irrespective of changes in land elevation.

130
00:09:17,020 --> 00:09:22,100
According to this study, the sea level at Fort Denison has risen around 0.9mm a year

131
00:09:22,100 --> 00:09:31,280
over the last 100 years, and around 0.63mm a year before that, going back to 1886.

132
00:09:31,280 --> 00:09:35,380
Of course, I'm sure those who thought this photo is how sea level is measured are already

133
00:09:35,380 --> 00:09:42,560
furiously typing posts saying 0.6 to 0.9mm a year, that's tiny.

134
00:09:42,560 --> 00:09:47,720
But before you hit the send button, let me first say, I'm delighted you now accept

135
00:09:47,720 --> 00:09:53,220
actual scientific measurements instead of do your own research Facebook memes, because

136
00:09:53,220 --> 00:09:57,780
clearly that 0.0cm claim was nonsense.

137
00:09:57,780 --> 00:10:02,740
And secondly, I haven't quite finished, we have to follow the science further.

138
00:10:02,740 --> 00:10:09,440
These are past sea level rises in Sydney Harbour, and like everywhere else, the rise is accelerating.

139
00:10:09,440 --> 00:10:14,500
So of course, past sea level rise is a lot less than current sea level rise.

140
00:10:14,500 --> 00:10:19,660
Also, Sydney Harbour is part of an area where sea levels are rising a lot slower than other

141
00:10:19,660 --> 00:10:23,780
parts of the world, like regions of the United States and Canada.

142
00:10:23,780 --> 00:10:27,620
As if sea level around the US could somehow be different than it is in the rest of the

143
00:10:27,620 --> 00:10:28,620
world.

144
00:10:28,620 --> 00:10:33,840
Yes, I know, if you do your own research in a bathtub, ocean water should rise at exactly

145
00:10:33,840 --> 00:10:36,040
the same rate everywhere.

146
00:10:36,040 --> 00:10:41,220
In the science world, even if you believe the rate of rise ought to be evenly distributed,

147
00:10:41,220 --> 00:10:44,540
you still have to measure it and find out.

148
00:10:44,540 --> 00:10:48,820
And when all the measurements are collected all over the world, this is the picture that

149
00:10:48,820 --> 00:10:50,160
emerges.

150
00:10:50,160 --> 00:10:56,120
The areas in red are where sea level is rising fastest, in blue it's rising slowest.

151
00:10:56,120 --> 00:11:00,760
Anyway, now that we've seen what the rate of sea level rise was in the past, and what

152
00:11:00,760 --> 00:11:06,240
it is now, according to measurements rather than guesses, let's move on to what it's going

153
00:11:06,240 --> 00:11:08,340
to do in the future.

154
00:11:08,340 --> 00:11:10,720
Who can we get that information from?

155
00:11:10,720 --> 00:11:13,680
Of course, an actor and theatre technician.

156
00:11:13,680 --> 00:11:14,680
He should know.

157
00:11:14,680 --> 00:11:18,040
Let's see now, 3mm a year, that means in 100 years...

158
00:11:18,040 --> 00:11:20,680
No, you can't work it out in your head, Bill.

159
00:11:20,680 --> 00:11:25,020
It's not as if you can simply multiply 3 by 100.

160
00:11:25,020 --> 00:11:29,960
These are just a couple of the equations required to estimate thermosteric sea level rise, which

161
00:11:29,960 --> 00:11:33,820
is the rise due to the expansion of warmer water.

162
00:11:33,820 --> 00:11:39,000
Then on top of that, you need to apply calculus to work out the response of sea level to past

163
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:44,480
temperature rise, and a whole load more measurements and calculations to work out how much ice

164
00:11:44,480 --> 00:11:49,380
will melt from Greenland and thousands of glaciers in response to future atmospheric

165
00:11:49,380 --> 00:11:50,760
and ocean temperature rises.

166
00:11:50,760 --> 00:11:53,240
I wish I had a science guy here to check my numbers.

167
00:11:53,240 --> 00:11:56,600
Oh god, you're not really going to just multiply 3 by 100, are you?

168
00:11:56,600 --> 00:11:57,600
We'll be up to...

169
00:11:57,600 --> 00:11:59,840
Don't say 300, don't say 300.

170
00:11:59,840 --> 00:12:00,840
300mm.

171
00:12:00,840 --> 00:12:01,840
No!

172
00:12:01,840 --> 00:12:03,760
Boy, that's 11.8 inches.

173
00:12:03,760 --> 00:12:04,960
That's almost a foot.

174
00:12:04,960 --> 00:12:09,920
Seriously, this is why science should be left to the professionals, not YouTubers who've

175
00:12:09,920 --> 00:12:15,240
never studied science past junior high school and do their own research.

176
00:12:15,240 --> 00:12:19,620
By the way, I've covered this claim by Bill Whittle before in another video, as well as

177
00:12:19,620 --> 00:12:23,920
a few of the other myths and facts about sea level rise, but I thought it worth bringing

178
00:12:23,920 --> 00:12:26,120
them all together into this video.

179
00:12:26,120 --> 00:12:32,080
Now, I'm sure Bill Whittle is very talented in the field he chose to study, which was

180
00:12:32,080 --> 00:12:37,280
theatre, and I'm happy to admit that's a subject I know nothing about.

181
00:12:37,280 --> 00:12:42,600
But that doesn't qualify him to calculate future glacial melt, ocean temperature profiles

182
00:12:42,600 --> 00:12:47,260
and thermosteric expansion, as he clearly showed.

183
00:12:47,260 --> 00:12:52,100
And Bill isn't kidding, he really does think he's worked out future sea level rise.

184
00:12:52,100 --> 00:12:56,800
I did study science, and even I can't work all that stuff out.

185
00:12:56,800 --> 00:13:02,460
To show why you can't simply multiply 3 by 100, let's start with the easy part, the difference

186
00:13:02,460 --> 00:13:05,980
between a linear curve and a geometric curve.

187
00:13:05,980 --> 00:13:10,660
In other words, the difference between velocity and acceleration.

188
00:13:10,660 --> 00:13:15,180
If I measure the velocity of a stone a fifth of a second after I drop it from the Leaning

189
00:13:15,180 --> 00:13:21,120
Tower of Pisa, its velocity would be around 1.96 metres a second.

190
00:13:21,120 --> 00:13:26,140
Since the top of the tower is 57 metres high, then according to Bill Whittle's formula of

191
00:13:26,140 --> 00:13:35,140
simple arithmetic, it should take 29 seconds before it hits the ground.

192
00:13:35,140 --> 00:13:37,420
That's an awfully long time.

193
00:13:37,420 --> 00:13:44,500
So how come in real life it can be measured and it only takes about 3.4 seconds?

194
00:13:44,500 --> 00:13:49,700
The answer is that it didn't stay at a constant velocity of 1.96 metres per second during

195
00:13:49,700 --> 00:13:53,200
the entire fall, it accelerated.

196
00:13:53,200 --> 00:13:56,900
This was first discovered by Galileo over 400 years ago.

197
00:13:56,900 --> 00:14:01,820
No, there's no evidence he dropped anything from the Leaning Tower of Pisa, but he did

198
00:14:01,820 --> 00:14:06,620
set up a clever experiment to measure the acceleration of a rolling ball.

199
00:14:06,620 --> 00:14:12,020
And thanks to this set of equations, we can work out exactly what speed it will be and

200
00:14:12,020 --> 00:14:16,780
what distance it will have covered over a given period of time.

201
00:14:16,780 --> 00:14:20,980
The same goes for a linear versus geometric growth.

202
00:14:20,980 --> 00:14:25,580
If it was a simple case of projecting a straight line into the future, then anyone with a fifth

203
00:14:25,580 --> 00:14:30,120
grade science education could do that with a ruler and pencil.

204
00:14:30,120 --> 00:14:35,760
But a geometric curve, which is an acceleration, is more complicated.

205
00:14:35,760 --> 00:14:40,120
Scientists have to figure out not just what the rate of melt and thermosteric expansion

206
00:14:40,120 --> 00:14:45,520
is, but they also have to work out the rate at which it's accelerating.

207
00:14:45,520 --> 00:14:48,560
So what have real scientists found?

208
00:14:48,560 --> 00:14:53,280
If you get your science from popular media, then the conclusions of scientists are rather

209
00:14:53,280 --> 00:14:54,280
confusing.

210
00:14:54,280 --> 00:15:01,720
If Greenland broke up and melted, or if half of Greenland and half of West Antarctica broke

211
00:15:01,720 --> 00:15:06,440
up and melted, this is what would happen to the sea level in Florida.

212
00:15:06,440 --> 00:15:10,320
So we were told sea levels would rise and we'd have to evacuate the coasts.

213
00:15:10,320 --> 00:15:12,680
These are two opposite ends of the spectrum.

214
00:15:12,680 --> 00:15:16,080
This guy seems to think that scientists were predicting that we'd have to evacuate the

215
00:15:16,080 --> 00:15:20,520
coasts by 2018, presumably all of them.

216
00:15:20,520 --> 00:15:25,320
And since we haven't evacuated all the coasts, he concludes that the science must be wrong.

217
00:15:25,320 --> 00:15:30,200
And this guy doesn't say when these huge sea level rises will happen, so a lot of people

218
00:15:30,200 --> 00:15:34,280
assume that Al Gore was talking about this century.

219
00:15:34,280 --> 00:15:39,680
Now it's true that studies show sea level will rise by this much if and when Greenland's

220
00:15:39,680 --> 00:15:45,400
ice melts, but they conclude that's many hundreds of years into the future.

221
00:15:45,400 --> 00:15:50,480
Not a good thing, obviously, but the timescale needs to be made clear.

222
00:15:50,480 --> 00:15:56,540
So let's get our predictions from scientific studies rather than videos and movies.

223
00:15:56,540 --> 00:16:01,160
Researchers use two completely different methods to work out how far and how fast sea levels

224
00:16:01,160 --> 00:16:03,600
will rise into the future.

225
00:16:03,600 --> 00:16:07,440
One method is to look at where sea level was when the Earth was at the same temperature

226
00:16:07,440 --> 00:16:11,340
in the past, taking account of eustatic changes.

227
00:16:11,340 --> 00:16:16,840
The other is to calculate the extra volume of water from thermosteric expansion and ice

228
00:16:16,840 --> 00:16:18,020
melt.

229
00:16:18,020 --> 00:16:24,920
How fast sea levels continue to rise obviously depends on how much CO2 we pump into the atmosphere.

230
00:16:24,920 --> 00:16:28,980
So there are different scenarios for different outcomes.

231
00:16:28,980 --> 00:16:34,360
Obviously if we follow the do your own research path where CO2 doesn't cause warming and even

232
00:16:34,360 --> 00:16:38,020
if it does cause warming that'll be a good thing and even if it's a bad thing there isn't

233
00:16:38,020 --> 00:16:42,080
anything we can do about it and even if there was something we can do about it it'll probably

234
00:16:42,080 --> 00:16:48,840
cost money, that path, then CO2 will continue to rise at the same rate, radiative forcing

235
00:16:48,840 --> 00:16:56,880
will be around 8.5W per square metre and sea level will rise around 12ft by 2100.

236
00:16:56,880 --> 00:17:02,700
But assuming some action is taken to drastically curb CO2 output under the most likely scenario

237
00:17:02,700 --> 00:17:08,800
called RCP4.5 then we'll see a rise of about 3ft.

238
00:17:08,800 --> 00:17:13,380
And of course sea level won't stop rising just because we hit that magical date with

239
00:17:13,380 --> 00:17:15,400
two zeros in it.

240
00:17:15,400 --> 00:17:21,960
Even if we reduce worldwide carbon emissions to zero by 2100 temperature will keep rising

241
00:17:21,960 --> 00:17:25,560
because of what's called positive feedback.

242
00:17:25,560 --> 00:17:31,500
So it'll take decades before the Earth reaches its new stable equilibrium temperature which

243
00:17:31,500 --> 00:17:39,940
will be over 3°C under RCP4.5 that's about 6°F.

244
00:17:39,940 --> 00:17:43,380
Researchers have found that the last time the Earth hit that kind of temperature during

245
00:17:43,380 --> 00:17:50,980
the Pliocene more than 2.5 million years ago sea levels were 16-62ft higher.

246
00:17:50,980 --> 00:17:53,540
But it's not going to happen overnight.

247
00:17:53,540 --> 00:17:58,300
If you fill a swimming pool with cold water on a warm day it takes time for the water

248
00:17:58,300 --> 00:17:59,900
to warm up.

249
00:17:59,900 --> 00:18:05,460
And if you put an ice sculpture under the hot sun it takes a long time for it to melt.

250
00:18:05,460 --> 00:18:11,540
So even when the Earth reaches its new equilibrium temperature perhaps 6°F higher than it is

251
00:18:11,540 --> 00:18:16,540
today sea level will keep rising for hundreds of years.

252
00:18:16,540 --> 00:18:22,160
That means the lives of people two, four or even ten generations into the future will

253
00:18:22,160 --> 00:18:27,320
depend on the decisions we take now.

254
00:18:27,320 --> 00:18:33,480
Now three feet may not seem like much up against a 20ft tower or a cliff face.

255
00:18:33,480 --> 00:18:37,040
That's because these structures are rising vertically.

256
00:18:37,040 --> 00:18:42,000
However along most of the shoreline the land is sloping or even flat.

257
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:48,800
So there the three feet rise would send seawater dozens or even hundreds of feet inland.

258
00:18:48,800 --> 00:18:54,180
And unfortunately flat coastal land and estuaries are precisely where we've decided to build

259
00:18:54,180 --> 00:18:59,140
most of our expensive and densely populated infrastructure.

260
00:18:59,140 --> 00:19:02,660
But wasn't New York supposed to be already underwater by now?

261
00:19:02,660 --> 00:19:06,600
I've been getting comments on the channel from people who really believe this was a

262
00:19:06,600 --> 00:19:08,700
scientific prediction.

263
00:19:08,700 --> 00:19:14,900
Apparently in 1988 James Hansen said Lower Manhattan would be underwater by 2018.

264
00:19:14,900 --> 00:19:21,620
Wait, no, Hansen said all of Manhattan will be underwater by 2018 and that's supported

265
00:19:21,620 --> 00:19:25,340
by an impeccable source, a blog.

266
00:19:25,340 --> 00:19:29,380
And as long as we're making stuff up, let's say his prediction was that the whole of New

267
00:19:29,380 --> 00:19:32,620
York will be underwater by 2018.

268
00:19:32,620 --> 00:19:38,540
Better yet, he predicted that the entire city of New York would vanish overnight.

269
00:19:38,540 --> 00:19:42,300
And where did he make this prediction that Lower Manhattan or Manhattan or the whole

270
00:19:42,300 --> 00:19:48,020
of New York would be underwater by midnight on December 31st 2017?

271
00:19:48,020 --> 00:19:49,700
Why it's all over the web.

272
00:19:49,700 --> 00:19:53,460
Where people go to do their own research.

273
00:19:53,460 --> 00:20:00,340
So if this really was a scientific prediction, then why isn't the West Side Highway underwater?

274
00:20:00,340 --> 00:20:04,260
To bust the myth, we first have to track down the source.

275
00:20:04,260 --> 00:20:09,220
Let's ask someone who always gives his source but never properly reads or fact checks it.

276
00:20:09,220 --> 00:20:12,700
Here's another James Hansen forecast from 1988.

277
00:20:12,700 --> 00:20:19,300
He predicted that within 30 years, i.e. this year, Lower Manhattan would be underwater.

278
00:20:19,300 --> 00:20:20,860
Good old Tony Heller.

279
00:20:20,860 --> 00:20:23,460
So this wasn't a scientific study at all.

280
00:20:23,460 --> 00:20:27,300
It was speculation by Hansen in a magazine.

281
00:20:27,300 --> 00:20:28,540
Or was it?

282
00:20:28,540 --> 00:20:32,500
No, turns out Salon magazine never even talked to Hansen.

283
00:20:32,500 --> 00:20:37,220
They interviewed a journalist, Bob Rice, who was recalling a conversation he had had with

284
00:20:37,220 --> 00:20:41,980
Hansen 12 or 13 years earlier for an upcoming book.

285
00:20:41,980 --> 00:20:47,420
As Rice remembered it, they were in Hansen's office in Lower Manhattan and Rice told Salon

286
00:20:47,420 --> 00:20:48,420
magazine this.

287
00:20:48,540 --> 00:20:52,900
I went over to the window with him and looked down on Broadway in New York City and said,

288
00:20:52,900 --> 00:20:56,460
if what you're saying about the greenhouse effect is true, is anything going to look

289
00:20:56,460 --> 00:20:58,860
different down there in 20 years?

290
00:20:58,860 --> 00:21:05,260
Hansen said that the West Side Highway, which runs along the Hudson River, will be underwater.

291
00:21:05,260 --> 00:21:08,940
Tony Heller didn't find this Salon magazine interview himself.

292
00:21:08,940 --> 00:21:11,260
He copied it off the blogosphere.

293
00:21:11,260 --> 00:21:15,660
It had been circulating ever since a blogger called Anthony Watts discovered the article

294
00:21:15,660 --> 00:21:17,740
in 2009.

295
00:21:17,740 --> 00:21:21,740
As we've seen, there were lots of embellishments and changes along the way.

296
00:21:21,740 --> 00:21:26,980
So in 1988, he predicted that Lower Manhattan would be underwater within 30 years.

297
00:21:26,980 --> 00:21:27,980
Thirty years?

298
00:21:27,980 --> 00:21:33,260
I thought Tony Heller had just read the article out loud and Rice had said it was 20 years.

299
00:21:33,260 --> 00:21:35,420
So why did Tony Heller change it?

300
00:21:35,420 --> 00:21:39,800
Well, it goes all the way back to that first blog by Anthony Watts.

301
00:21:39,800 --> 00:21:42,180
He got his sums wrong.

302
00:21:42,180 --> 00:21:47,500
Since the magazine interview was in 2001 and Rice said his interview with Hansen had been

303
00:21:47,500 --> 00:21:52,780
12 to 13 years earlier, that would mean the prediction was made around 1988.

304
00:21:52,780 --> 00:22:00,660
1988 plus 20 years makes … too slow, Bill … 2008.

305
00:22:00,660 --> 00:22:08,540
Unfortunately, when Watts added 20 to 1988, he mistakenly got 2018.

306
00:22:08,540 --> 00:22:13,100
So that date was copied and pasted by other bloggers.

307
00:22:13,100 --> 00:22:16,980
When it was Tony Heller's turn to copy the myth, he could see the dates didn't

308
00:22:16,980 --> 00:22:18,180
add up.

309
00:22:18,180 --> 00:22:23,500
But the first rule of doing your own research is never question the blogosphere.

310
00:22:23,500 --> 00:22:27,160
Once a myth is set in stone, you can't correct it.

311
00:22:27,160 --> 00:22:32,380
So Tony decided instead to change the time period that was spelled out in the magazine

312
00:22:32,380 --> 00:22:35,380
that he'd just read out loud.

313
00:22:35,380 --> 00:22:40,780
And that allowed him to dutifully follow the line that Hansen's prediction was for 2018.

314
00:22:40,780 --> 00:22:46,580
It's a classic case of changing the evidence to fit the conclusion, even when you know

315
00:22:46,580 --> 00:22:48,060
the conclusion is wrong.

316
00:22:48,060 --> 00:22:51,860
Don't you just love how the blogosphere works?

317
00:22:51,860 --> 00:22:56,500
The funny thing is, Hansen didn't say 20 years or 30 years.

318
00:22:56,500 --> 00:23:02,340
Despite being copied on the blogosphere hundreds of times, no one thought to check with Hansen

319
00:23:02,340 --> 00:23:07,520
to confirm that's what he actually said, or check with Rice's book to see if Rice

320
00:23:07,520 --> 00:23:11,160
had remembered the conversation correctly.

321
00:23:11,160 --> 00:23:13,520
As it turned out, he hadn't.

322
00:23:13,520 --> 00:23:17,240
Rice later admitted he was being interviewed on the telephone, and he didn't have his

323
00:23:17,240 --> 00:23:20,440
notes, so he got the details wrong.

324
00:23:20,440 --> 00:23:24,760
After checking with his own book, he said his question was what the view would be like

325
00:23:24,760 --> 00:23:29,480
outside the window in 40 years with doubled CO2.

326
00:23:29,480 --> 00:23:31,800
So this is what's in the book.

327
00:23:31,800 --> 00:23:36,120
Hansen's own recollection of the conversation was exactly the same as the book that Rice

328
00:23:36,120 --> 00:23:41,400
had asked him to speculate on changes that might happen in New York City in 40 years

329
00:23:41,400 --> 00:23:45,600
assuming CO2 doubled in amount.

330
00:23:45,600 --> 00:23:51,400
Double CO2 concentration means a doubling from pre-industrial levels of around 265 parts

331
00:23:51,400 --> 00:23:55,720
per million to 530 parts per million.

332
00:23:55,720 --> 00:24:01,840
Rice might be forgiven for thinking that figure would be reached by 2028, because in 1988

333
00:24:01,840 --> 00:24:07,440
CO2 emissions were rising uncontrollably, and without governments agreeing to curb the

334
00:24:07,440 --> 00:24:11,720
emissions, they were on the path of this black line.

335
00:24:11,720 --> 00:24:17,680
But thanks to the Kyoto Protocol, CO2 is now at around 415 parts per million following

336
00:24:17,680 --> 00:24:19,100
the red line.

337
00:24:19,100 --> 00:24:26,180
So it looks like we'll hit the double CO2 concentration point around 2060 to 2070.

338
00:24:26,180 --> 00:24:31,820
If every nation adheres to Paris climate agreement targets, then a doubling of CO2 concentration

339
00:24:31,820 --> 00:24:34,860
could be pushed back even further.

340
00:24:34,860 --> 00:24:39,420
So now that we understand what the question was, was Hansen's answer correct?

341
00:24:39,420 --> 00:24:44,480
Well of course we don't know until CO2 concentration doubles.

342
00:24:44,480 --> 00:24:49,640
My sources are in the video description and they suggest that at the time CO2 concentration

343
00:24:49,640 --> 00:24:55,620
doubles, sea level will have risen about 0.2 to 0.6 metres.

344
00:24:55,620 --> 00:24:58,560
Is that enough to cover the west side highway?

345
00:24:58,560 --> 00:25:02,840
Well no good looking at this highway Cam, because this isn't the west side highway

346
00:25:02,840 --> 00:25:04,960
Hansen was talking about.

347
00:25:04,960 --> 00:25:06,760
This is the new highway.

348
00:25:06,760 --> 00:25:13,960
It was built on top of the old highway that Hansen was pointing to in 1988 or 1989.

349
00:25:13,960 --> 00:25:18,520
I don't know the elevation of that highway, so I don't know if the sea will have covered

350
00:25:18,520 --> 00:25:20,960
some parts of it, or all of it.

351
00:25:20,960 --> 00:25:26,360
Unless someone does a proper peer reviewed study, then this isn't a scientific study,

352
00:25:26,360 --> 00:25:30,200
it's pointless and groundless speculation.

353
00:25:30,200 --> 00:25:35,360
Of course decades later a doubling of CO2 concentration will very likely lead to a rise

354
00:25:35,360 --> 00:25:41,280
in sea level of several metres according to real scientific studies, more than enough

355
00:25:41,280 --> 00:25:44,380
to cover most of Lower Manhattan.

356
00:25:44,380 --> 00:25:48,940
This is what it would look like when sea level rise is just 8 feet.

357
00:25:48,940 --> 00:25:51,560
But that isn't the prediction Hansen made.

358
00:25:51,560 --> 00:25:57,480
He didn't say a doubling of CO2 concentration will cause the west side highway to be inundated,

359
00:25:57,480 --> 00:26:02,980
he said the west side highway will be inundated when CO2 levels double.

360
00:26:02,980 --> 00:26:06,480
Not just part of it, and not just some of the time.

361
00:26:06,480 --> 00:26:10,160
And that seems to contradict most scientific projections.

362
00:26:10,160 --> 00:26:15,120
It emphasises my point that scientists shouldn't indulge in speculation without reference to

363
00:26:15,120 --> 00:26:21,240
a proper scientific study, and why Rice shouldn't invite or publish that kind of speculation

364
00:26:21,240 --> 00:26:25,320
in a book that's supposed to be reporting the facts about climate change.

365
00:26:25,320 --> 00:26:29,320
James Hansen is a great scientist, but he's not an oracle.

366
00:26:29,320 --> 00:26:34,760
A scientist is only as good as the research that supports his conclusions.

367
00:26:34,760 --> 00:26:40,480
If there isn't any supporting research, published in a respected peer reviewed scientific journal,

368
00:26:40,480 --> 00:26:46,240
then proclamations count for nothing, no matter the status of the scientist making them.

369
00:26:46,240 --> 00:26:51,920
If you want to know what the scientific predictions are, read the scientific literature.

370
00:26:51,920 --> 00:26:56,200
The date the west side highway, or any other piece of coastal infrastructure, actually

371
00:26:56,200 --> 00:27:02,880
gets submerged is really not that relevant, because houses, highways, hospitals and railways

372
00:27:02,880 --> 00:27:06,240
will be affected long before they are physically inundated.

373
00:27:06,240 --> 00:27:11,560
Venice, for example, isn't yet under water, but floods are becoming more common with each

374
00:27:11,560 --> 00:27:15,720
storm surge and each exceptionally high tide.

375
00:27:15,720 --> 00:27:20,680
coastal areas and islands are increasingly having to deal with storm surges and salination,

376
00:27:20,680 --> 00:27:25,600
which is why people are moving long before the water actually permanently covers their

377
00:27:25,600 --> 00:27:26,600
homes.

378
00:27:26,600 --> 00:27:32,240
I've looked at this in my video on the Maldives, busting yet another vlogger who did his own

379
00:27:32,240 --> 00:27:39,200
research by reading spurious tabloid newspapers rather than scientific studies.

380
00:27:39,200 --> 00:27:43,680
So if you're going to do your own research, first of all understand that geophysics is

381
00:27:43,680 --> 00:27:48,480
a lot more complicated than just multiplying one number by another.

382
00:27:48,480 --> 00:27:54,160
Secondly, if you want to do your own research to find out what scientific predictions are,

383
00:27:54,160 --> 00:28:00,280
then read the scientific predictions, like the studies I've listed in the video description.

384
00:28:00,280 --> 00:28:06,760
Don't just trust blogs, books, tweets and tabloids to tell you, because here's the shocker,

385
00:28:06,760 --> 00:28:09,840
they aren't always accurate.

386
00:28:09,840 --> 00:28:15,400
My thanks to all those who've been donating to this charity in order to support my channel.

387
00:28:15,400 --> 00:28:20,560
Unlike many YouTubers and bloggers who are pushing their own junk research, I don't do

388
00:28:20,560 --> 00:28:23,280
this for money and I don't ask for money.

389
00:28:23,280 --> 00:28:27,920
I've had trouble naming the charity as the beneficiary of monetisation of this channel,

390
00:28:27,920 --> 00:28:33,400
which is why it's still ad-free, but your generous contributions alone have now raised

391
00:28:33,400 --> 00:28:37,560
nearly $200,000 for Health in Harmony.

392
00:28:37,560 --> 00:28:42,160
Health in Harmony provides healthcare to communities near rainforests in exchange for

393
00:28:42,160 --> 00:28:47,960
an end to logging, because the reason so many people cut down trees in this area is because

394
00:28:47,960 --> 00:28:50,580
healthcare is unaffordable.

395
00:28:50,580 --> 00:28:56,320
So it's a charity that saves lives, improves health and helps preserve the rainforest,

396
00:28:56,320 --> 00:29:00,460
not to mention that your donation will encourage me to keep my channel going.

397
00:29:00,460 --> 00:29:04,360
So it's a win, win, win, win.

398
00:29:04,360 --> 00:29:05,280
You tired of winning yet?
