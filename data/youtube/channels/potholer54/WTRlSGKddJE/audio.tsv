0	5280	For those who are skeptical about the rise in sea level caused by global warming, here
5280	7520	are some scientific predictions that were made.
7520	10760	So we were told sea levels would rise and we'd have to evacuate the coasts.
10760	15280	Let's take a look here, Sydney Harbor, 140 years.
15280	22160	He predicted that within 30 years, i.e. this year, lower Manhattan would be under water.
22160	25360	And here's how scientists measure that sea level rise.
25360	26360	Just there.
26360	28800	It's going up by about a millimeter.
28800	29800	Rising sea level.
29800	30800	You got it?
30800	31800	I've got it.
31800	32800	Three mil.
32800	33800	Well, no prizes for guessing.
33800	39440	This isn't how they measure sea level rise and these aren't scientific predictions.
39440	44000	They're just what bloggers and pundits think scientific predictions and measurements are
44000	49680	because when they do their own research, they don't check scientific studies to find out.
49680	54520	They just get their information from other TV shows, books, newspaper columnists and
54520	55520	bloggers.
56080	61520	We'll take a look at the real scientific predictions and how sea level rise is being measured later
61520	63800	in the video.
63800	65280	Why do the critics do it?
65280	71200	Well, of course, it's a very old tactic, taking a leaf out of the creationist manual.
71200	75080	Invent your own science, create your own scientist, even.
75080	77280	Make his claims as stupid as possible.
77280	82680	I think what you must remember is that as true scientists, we are constantly searching
82680	83680	for evidence.
83680	87680	Prove that which we already believe to be truth.
87680	92280	And then amaze your audience with your skill in demolishing them.
92280	97540	So if the science critics aren't explaining what the science says, where do you go?
97540	101760	The same place real scientists go when they want to look at the latest discoveries in
101760	106120	their field, respected peer-reviewed scientific journals.
106120	110420	And if you find these rather daunting, then get your information from reputable science
110420	115620	media where these studies are accurately reported and cited.
115620	120500	Now you may not trust or believe the studies, maybe you think they're part of a huge worldwide
120500	126140	conspiracy, but at least you'll know what they actually say instead of relying on spurious
126140	131100	blogs and news pundits to misinform you about what they say.
131100	134820	Before we look at the fallacies, let's start with the basics.
134820	140620	Why are sea levels rising and expected to rise further as the Earth heats up?
140620	145900	The most obvious reason is that higher temperatures mean more ice is melting, which I'm sure makes
145900	149020	perfect sense even to people who never studied science.
149020	153540	How long will it take for the sea level to rise two feet?
153540	158180	Think about it, if your ice cube melts in your glass, it doesn't overflow, it's displacement.
158180	161380	This is the thing, some of the things that they're talking about, mathematically and
161380	163580	scientifically don't make sense.
163620	168380	OK, they don't make sense to one person who never studied science, so for Congressman
168380	173420	Stockman's benefit I'll explain the physics in words of one syllable, because it really
173420	175540	is that simple.
175540	181540	Land, ice, melt, fill, rise.
181540	184820	Think about it, if your ice cube melts in your glass, it doesn't overflow.
184820	189940	But the great thing about basic physics is that you can do a lot of the experiments yourself.
189940	195300	Put a draining board to represent Greenland over a glass, put some ice on it to represent
195300	198980	Greenland's ice cap, and what do you get?
198980	203060	Ice, melt, fill, rise.
203060	207060	The real lesson from this is that any time a politician tells you he's spotted a flaw
207060	212500	in the laws of physics that scientists have overlooked, put your money on the scientists
212500	215540	knowing something he doesn't.
215540	219860	Like all good science, this melt isn't just obvious in theory, it can be measured
219860	222260	and quantified in practice.
222260	227580	For example, a satellite system called GRACE constantly records the mass of ice on top
227580	231140	of Greenland using a gravitometer.
231140	236460	Research has found that Greenland has been losing around 255 billion tonnes of ice every
236460	237460	year.
237460	241940	That means the amount of ice lost through melting and ablation, minus the amount gained
241940	244220	through precipitation.
244260	248700	Green glaciers are also contributing a huge amount to sea level rise.
248700	255300	There are about 200,000 glaciers worldwide, covering roughly 10% of the Earth's surface.
255300	261980	Outside of Greenland, glaciers are losing some 267 billion tonnes of ice every year,
261980	269700	contributing to a rise of about 0.7mm in sea levels annually, 20% of the total rise.
269700	275940	The other half of the rise, less well-known, is the expansion of water as it gets warmer.
275940	279840	The fact that the oceans are getting warmer has been directly measured, and the fact that
279840	284700	warming water expands is another well-known principle of physics.
284700	289860	And again, you can actually do this experiment yourself to be sure it's not just a conspiracy
289860	294100	by 18th century scientists who first discovered it.
294100	296660	Just follow the instructions.
296660	298380	There are a couple of other factors.
298380	300340	One is terrestrial storage.
300340	306780	So during extensive flooding in Pakistan in 2010, sea level actually fell temporarily.
306780	310560	But these ups and downs don't change the long-term picture.
310560	317140	And sea level is also affected by eustatic changes, movement of the land rising and falling.
317140	322220	A failure to understand this eustatic movement has often led to fallacious news reports from
322220	333300	Reuters and others claiming ridiculously high rises in sea level because in this case
333300	339980	the reporter was unaware that the crustal plate on which she's standing has been subsiding.
339980	344660	Scientists on the other hand factor these eustatic changes into their measurements.
344660	350120	The amount of melting ice from Greenland and glaciers outside Greenland is accelerating
350120	352360	at the high end of predictions.
352360	357400	And this, combined with a more rapid expansion of warmer water, has led to an acceleration
357400	361120	in sea level rise over the last few decades.
361120	367340	If we go back to the end of the last glaciation, after a 400ft rise due to melting ice sheets,
367340	372660	there hasn't been much of a change in sea level for the last 3,700 years.
372660	377760	This can be determined by taking sediment cores from coastal zones, dating coral growth
377760	383380	rates and other techniques that, put together, show a picture of a very small and steady
383380	387040	rise of less than a millimetre a year.
387040	392600	But during the 20th century, when global temperatures went up significantly, sea level rise more
392600	402720	than doubled from 0.8mm a year to 1.9mm a year, then accelerated again to 3.1mm a year.
402720	407600	And sea level is currently rising around 3.6mm a year.
407600	412480	So basic physics tells us a hotter climate should be raising sea levels, as we've seen
412480	414600	it do in the past.
414600	419440	In fact, those who dispute that really need to explain how it's possible that warmer
419440	425440	water and melting ice would not cause sea level to rise, but they do raise a legitimate
425440	426440	question.
426440	432800	If sea level really is rising at over 3mm a year, how come we can't see it in old
432800	434940	photos?
434940	439800	This photo has been passed around Facebook and Twitter for years, showing, apparently,
439800	445560	a rise of 0.0cm in sea levels, in other words zero.
445560	451320	If whoever produced this photo is measuring sea level rise to the nearest 0.1cm, that's
451320	456460	a millimetre, it means that he's got eyesight keen enough to determine that the level of
456460	462740	water on the right is less than half a millimetre higher than the level of water on the left.
462740	467420	Well done to whoever managed that, but that isn't science.
467420	470280	That's called doing your own research.
470280	474600	For a start, there's a half metre tidal variation at Sydney Harbour, where this photo
474600	475920	was taken.
475920	480060	So the photo on the left could have been taken at high tide, and the photo on the right at
480060	484660	low tide, meaning sea level has risen about half a metre.
484660	489380	There's no evidence of exactly when during the tidal cycle the photo was taken.
489380	494140	Facebook users can't even agree on the year the photo was taken, and as is pretty
494140	498720	obvious, even the wave height varies between the two pictures.
498720	503420	But it's an interesting example of what happens when you do your own research.
503420	508160	In the do your own research world there's no need for accurate measurements and accurate
508160	510700	recorded data collection.
510700	515300	In the science world, researchers have been measuring sea level rise in Sydney Harbour
515300	520340	since 1886, in fact right here at Fort Denison.
520340	525060	Before sophisticated instruments came along, they used a simple measuring rule inside a
525060	529220	stilling well, which minimised the impact of waves.
529220	534760	In the 1960s they measured more accurately with microwave radar scanners, but these were
534760	540380	fixed on land, so it was hard to determine whether the sea was rising or the land was
540380	541940	sinking.
541940	547020	So these older measurements now have to be adjusted to take account of land movement.
547020	552180	It was only in the 1990s that satellites were able to measure sea level rise with millimetre
552180	557020	precision irrespective of changes in land elevation.
557020	562100	According to this study, the sea level at Fort Denison has risen around 0.9mm a year
562100	571280	over the last 100 years, and around 0.63mm a year before that, going back to 1886.
571280	575380	Of course, I'm sure those who thought this photo is how sea level is measured are already
575380	582560	furiously typing posts saying 0.6 to 0.9mm a year, that's tiny.
582560	587720	But before you hit the send button, let me first say, I'm delighted you now accept
587720	593220	actual scientific measurements instead of do your own research Facebook memes, because
593220	597780	clearly that 0.0cm claim was nonsense.
597780	602740	And secondly, I haven't quite finished, we have to follow the science further.
602740	609440	These are past sea level rises in Sydney Harbour, and like everywhere else, the rise is accelerating.
609440	614500	So of course, past sea level rise is a lot less than current sea level rise.
614500	619660	Also, Sydney Harbour is part of an area where sea levels are rising a lot slower than other
619660	623780	parts of the world, like regions of the United States and Canada.
623780	627620	As if sea level around the US could somehow be different than it is in the rest of the
627620	628620	world.
628620	633840	Yes, I know, if you do your own research in a bathtub, ocean water should rise at exactly
633840	636040	the same rate everywhere.
636040	641220	In the science world, even if you believe the rate of rise ought to be evenly distributed,
641220	644540	you still have to measure it and find out.
644540	648820	And when all the measurements are collected all over the world, this is the picture that
648820	650160	emerges.
650160	656120	The areas in red are where sea level is rising fastest, in blue it's rising slowest.
656120	660760	Anyway, now that we've seen what the rate of sea level rise was in the past, and what
660760	666240	it is now, according to measurements rather than guesses, let's move on to what it's going
666240	668340	to do in the future.
668340	670720	Who can we get that information from?
670720	673680	Of course, an actor and theatre technician.
673680	674680	He should know.
674680	678040	Let's see now, 3mm a year, that means in 100 years...
678040	680680	No, you can't work it out in your head, Bill.
680680	685020	It's not as if you can simply multiply 3 by 100.
685020	689960	These are just a couple of the equations required to estimate thermosteric sea level rise, which
689960	693820	is the rise due to the expansion of warmer water.
693820	699000	Then on top of that, you need to apply calculus to work out the response of sea level to past
699000	704480	temperature rise, and a whole load more measurements and calculations to work out how much ice
704480	709380	will melt from Greenland and thousands of glaciers in response to future atmospheric
709380	710760	and ocean temperature rises.
710760	713240	I wish I had a science guy here to check my numbers.
713240	716600	Oh god, you're not really going to just multiply 3 by 100, are you?
716600	717600	We'll be up to...
717600	719840	Don't say 300, don't say 300.
719840	720840	300mm.
720840	721840	No!
721840	723760	Boy, that's 11.8 inches.
723760	724960	That's almost a foot.
724960	729920	Seriously, this is why science should be left to the professionals, not YouTubers who've
729920	735240	never studied science past junior high school and do their own research.
735240	739620	By the way, I've covered this claim by Bill Whittle before in another video, as well as
739620	743920	a few of the other myths and facts about sea level rise, but I thought it worth bringing
743920	746120	them all together into this video.
746120	752080	Now, I'm sure Bill Whittle is very talented in the field he chose to study, which was
752080	757280	theatre, and I'm happy to admit that's a subject I know nothing about.
757280	762600	But that doesn't qualify him to calculate future glacial melt, ocean temperature profiles
762600	767260	and thermosteric expansion, as he clearly showed.
767260	772100	And Bill isn't kidding, he really does think he's worked out future sea level rise.
772100	776800	I did study science, and even I can't work all that stuff out.
776800	782460	To show why you can't simply multiply 3 by 100, let's start with the easy part, the difference
782460	785980	between a linear curve and a geometric curve.
785980	790660	In other words, the difference between velocity and acceleration.
790660	795180	If I measure the velocity of a stone a fifth of a second after I drop it from the Leaning
795180	801120	Tower of Pisa, its velocity would be around 1.96 metres a second.
801120	806140	Since the top of the tower is 57 metres high, then according to Bill Whittle's formula of
806140	815140	simple arithmetic, it should take 29 seconds before it hits the ground.
815140	817420	That's an awfully long time.
817420	824500	So how come in real life it can be measured and it only takes about 3.4 seconds?
824500	829700	The answer is that it didn't stay at a constant velocity of 1.96 metres per second during
829700	833200	the entire fall, it accelerated.
833200	836900	This was first discovered by Galileo over 400 years ago.
836900	841820	No, there's no evidence he dropped anything from the Leaning Tower of Pisa, but he did
841820	846620	set up a clever experiment to measure the acceleration of a rolling ball.
846620	852020	And thanks to this set of equations, we can work out exactly what speed it will be and
852020	856780	what distance it will have covered over a given period of time.
856780	860980	The same goes for a linear versus geometric growth.
860980	865580	If it was a simple case of projecting a straight line into the future, then anyone with a fifth
865580	870120	grade science education could do that with a ruler and pencil.
870120	875760	But a geometric curve, which is an acceleration, is more complicated.
875760	880120	Scientists have to figure out not just what the rate of melt and thermosteric expansion
880120	885520	is, but they also have to work out the rate at which it's accelerating.
885520	888560	So what have real scientists found?
888560	893280	If you get your science from popular media, then the conclusions of scientists are rather
893280	894280	confusing.
894280	901720	If Greenland broke up and melted, or if half of Greenland and half of West Antarctica broke
901720	906440	up and melted, this is what would happen to the sea level in Florida.
906440	910320	So we were told sea levels would rise and we'd have to evacuate the coasts.
910320	912680	These are two opposite ends of the spectrum.
912680	916080	This guy seems to think that scientists were predicting that we'd have to evacuate the
916080	920520	coasts by 2018, presumably all of them.
920520	925320	And since we haven't evacuated all the coasts, he concludes that the science must be wrong.
925320	930200	And this guy doesn't say when these huge sea level rises will happen, so a lot of people
930200	934280	assume that Al Gore was talking about this century.
934280	939680	Now it's true that studies show sea level will rise by this much if and when Greenland's
939680	945400	ice melts, but they conclude that's many hundreds of years into the future.
945400	950480	Not a good thing, obviously, but the timescale needs to be made clear.
950480	956540	So let's get our predictions from scientific studies rather than videos and movies.
956540	961160	Researchers use two completely different methods to work out how far and how fast sea levels
961160	963600	will rise into the future.
963600	967440	One method is to look at where sea level was when the Earth was at the same temperature
967440	971340	in the past, taking account of eustatic changes.
971340	976840	The other is to calculate the extra volume of water from thermosteric expansion and ice
976840	978020	melt.
978020	984920	How fast sea levels continue to rise obviously depends on how much CO2 we pump into the atmosphere.
984920	988980	So there are different scenarios for different outcomes.
988980	994360	Obviously if we follow the do your own research path where CO2 doesn't cause warming and even
994360	998020	if it does cause warming that'll be a good thing and even if it's a bad thing there isn't
998020	1002080	anything we can do about it and even if there was something we can do about it it'll probably
1002080	1008840	cost money, that path, then CO2 will continue to rise at the same rate, radiative forcing
1008840	1016880	will be around 8.5W per square metre and sea level will rise around 12ft by 2100.
1016880	1022700	But assuming some action is taken to drastically curb CO2 output under the most likely scenario
1022700	1028800	called RCP4.5 then we'll see a rise of about 3ft.
1028800	1033380	And of course sea level won't stop rising just because we hit that magical date with
1033380	1035400	two zeros in it.
1035400	1041960	Even if we reduce worldwide carbon emissions to zero by 2100 temperature will keep rising
1041960	1045560	because of what's called positive feedback.
1045560	1051500	So it'll take decades before the Earth reaches its new stable equilibrium temperature which
1051500	1059940	will be over 3°C under RCP4.5 that's about 6°F.
1059940	1063380	Researchers have found that the last time the Earth hit that kind of temperature during
1063380	1070980	the Pliocene more than 2.5 million years ago sea levels were 16-62ft higher.
1070980	1073540	But it's not going to happen overnight.
1073540	1078300	If you fill a swimming pool with cold water on a warm day it takes time for the water
1078300	1079900	to warm up.
1079900	1085460	And if you put an ice sculpture under the hot sun it takes a long time for it to melt.
1085460	1091540	So even when the Earth reaches its new equilibrium temperature perhaps 6°F higher than it is
1091540	1096540	today sea level will keep rising for hundreds of years.
1096540	1102160	That means the lives of people two, four or even ten generations into the future will
1102160	1107320	depend on the decisions we take now.
1107320	1113480	Now three feet may not seem like much up against a 20ft tower or a cliff face.
1113480	1117040	That's because these structures are rising vertically.
1117040	1122000	However along most of the shoreline the land is sloping or even flat.
1122000	1128800	So there the three feet rise would send seawater dozens or even hundreds of feet inland.
1128800	1134180	And unfortunately flat coastal land and estuaries are precisely where we've decided to build
1134180	1139140	most of our expensive and densely populated infrastructure.
1139140	1142660	But wasn't New York supposed to be already underwater by now?
1142660	1146600	I've been getting comments on the channel from people who really believe this was a
1146600	1148700	scientific prediction.
1148700	1154900	Apparently in 1988 James Hansen said Lower Manhattan would be underwater by 2018.
1154900	1161620	Wait, no, Hansen said all of Manhattan will be underwater by 2018 and that's supported
1161620	1165340	by an impeccable source, a blog.
1165340	1169380	And as long as we're making stuff up, let's say his prediction was that the whole of New
1169380	1172620	York will be underwater by 2018.
1172620	1178540	Better yet, he predicted that the entire city of New York would vanish overnight.
1178540	1182300	And where did he make this prediction that Lower Manhattan or Manhattan or the whole
1182300	1188020	of New York would be underwater by midnight on December 31st 2017?
1188020	1189700	Why it's all over the web.
1189700	1193460	Where people go to do their own research.
1193460	1200340	So if this really was a scientific prediction, then why isn't the West Side Highway underwater?
1200340	1204260	To bust the myth, we first have to track down the source.
1204260	1209220	Let's ask someone who always gives his source but never properly reads or fact checks it.
1209220	1212700	Here's another James Hansen forecast from 1988.
1212700	1219300	He predicted that within 30 years, i.e. this year, Lower Manhattan would be underwater.
1219300	1220860	Good old Tony Heller.
1220860	1223460	So this wasn't a scientific study at all.
1223460	1227300	It was speculation by Hansen in a magazine.
1227300	1228540	Or was it?
1228540	1232500	No, turns out Salon magazine never even talked to Hansen.
1232500	1237220	They interviewed a journalist, Bob Rice, who was recalling a conversation he had had with
1237220	1241980	Hansen 12 or 13 years earlier for an upcoming book.
1241980	1247420	As Rice remembered it, they were in Hansen's office in Lower Manhattan and Rice told Salon
1247420	1248420	magazine this.
1248540	1252900	I went over to the window with him and looked down on Broadway in New York City and said,
1252900	1256460	if what you're saying about the greenhouse effect is true, is anything going to look
1256460	1258860	different down there in 20 years?
1258860	1265260	Hansen said that the West Side Highway, which runs along the Hudson River, will be underwater.
1265260	1268940	Tony Heller didn't find this Salon magazine interview himself.
1268940	1271260	He copied it off the blogosphere.
1271260	1275660	It had been circulating ever since a blogger called Anthony Watts discovered the article
1275660	1277740	in 2009.
1277740	1281740	As we've seen, there were lots of embellishments and changes along the way.
1281740	1286980	So in 1988, he predicted that Lower Manhattan would be underwater within 30 years.
1286980	1287980	Thirty years?
1287980	1293260	I thought Tony Heller had just read the article out loud and Rice had said it was 20 years.
1293260	1295420	So why did Tony Heller change it?
1295420	1299800	Well, it goes all the way back to that first blog by Anthony Watts.
1299800	1302180	He got his sums wrong.
1302180	1307500	Since the magazine interview was in 2001 and Rice said his interview with Hansen had been
1307500	1312780	12 to 13 years earlier, that would mean the prediction was made around 1988.
1312780	1320660	1988 plus 20 years makes … too slow, Bill … 2008.
1320660	1328540	Unfortunately, when Watts added 20 to 1988, he mistakenly got 2018.
1328540	1333100	So that date was copied and pasted by other bloggers.
1333100	1336980	When it was Tony Heller's turn to copy the myth, he could see the dates didn't
1336980	1338180	add up.
1338180	1343500	But the first rule of doing your own research is never question the blogosphere.
1343500	1347160	Once a myth is set in stone, you can't correct it.
1347160	1352380	So Tony decided instead to change the time period that was spelled out in the magazine
1352380	1355380	that he'd just read out loud.
1355380	1360780	And that allowed him to dutifully follow the line that Hansen's prediction was for 2018.
1360780	1366580	It's a classic case of changing the evidence to fit the conclusion, even when you know
1366580	1368060	the conclusion is wrong.
1368060	1371860	Don't you just love how the blogosphere works?
1371860	1376500	The funny thing is, Hansen didn't say 20 years or 30 years.
1376500	1382340	Despite being copied on the blogosphere hundreds of times, no one thought to check with Hansen
1382340	1387520	to confirm that's what he actually said, or check with Rice's book to see if Rice
1387520	1391160	had remembered the conversation correctly.
1391160	1393520	As it turned out, he hadn't.
1393520	1397240	Rice later admitted he was being interviewed on the telephone, and he didn't have his
1397240	1400440	notes, so he got the details wrong.
1400440	1404760	After checking with his own book, he said his question was what the view would be like
1404760	1409480	outside the window in 40 years with doubled CO2.
1409480	1411800	So this is what's in the book.
1411800	1416120	Hansen's own recollection of the conversation was exactly the same as the book that Rice
1416120	1421400	had asked him to speculate on changes that might happen in New York City in 40 years
1421400	1425600	assuming CO2 doubled in amount.
1425600	1431400	Double CO2 concentration means a doubling from pre-industrial levels of around 265 parts
1431400	1435720	per million to 530 parts per million.
1435720	1441840	Rice might be forgiven for thinking that figure would be reached by 2028, because in 1988
1441840	1447440	CO2 emissions were rising uncontrollably, and without governments agreeing to curb the
1447440	1451720	emissions, they were on the path of this black line.
1451720	1457680	But thanks to the Kyoto Protocol, CO2 is now at around 415 parts per million following
1457680	1459100	the red line.
1459100	1466180	So it looks like we'll hit the double CO2 concentration point around 2060 to 2070.
1466180	1471820	If every nation adheres to Paris climate agreement targets, then a doubling of CO2 concentration
1471820	1474860	could be pushed back even further.
1474860	1479420	So now that we understand what the question was, was Hansen's answer correct?
1479420	1484480	Well of course we don't know until CO2 concentration doubles.
1484480	1489640	My sources are in the video description and they suggest that at the time CO2 concentration
1489640	1495620	doubles, sea level will have risen about 0.2 to 0.6 metres.
1495620	1498560	Is that enough to cover the west side highway?
1498560	1502840	Well no good looking at this highway Cam, because this isn't the west side highway
1502840	1504960	Hansen was talking about.
1504960	1506760	This is the new highway.
1506760	1513960	It was built on top of the old highway that Hansen was pointing to in 1988 or 1989.
1513960	1518520	I don't know the elevation of that highway, so I don't know if the sea will have covered
1518520	1520960	some parts of it, or all of it.
1520960	1526360	Unless someone does a proper peer reviewed study, then this isn't a scientific study,
1526360	1530200	it's pointless and groundless speculation.
1530200	1535360	Of course decades later a doubling of CO2 concentration will very likely lead to a rise
1535360	1541280	in sea level of several metres according to real scientific studies, more than enough
1541280	1544380	to cover most of Lower Manhattan.
1544380	1548940	This is what it would look like when sea level rise is just 8 feet.
1548940	1551560	But that isn't the prediction Hansen made.
1551560	1557480	He didn't say a doubling of CO2 concentration will cause the west side highway to be inundated,
1557480	1562980	he said the west side highway will be inundated when CO2 levels double.
1562980	1566480	Not just part of it, and not just some of the time.
1566480	1570160	And that seems to contradict most scientific projections.
1570160	1575120	It emphasises my point that scientists shouldn't indulge in speculation without reference to
1575120	1581240	a proper scientific study, and why Rice shouldn't invite or publish that kind of speculation
1581240	1585320	in a book that's supposed to be reporting the facts about climate change.
1585320	1589320	James Hansen is a great scientist, but he's not an oracle.
1589320	1594760	A scientist is only as good as the research that supports his conclusions.
1594760	1600480	If there isn't any supporting research, published in a respected peer reviewed scientific journal,
1600480	1606240	then proclamations count for nothing, no matter the status of the scientist making them.
1606240	1611920	If you want to know what the scientific predictions are, read the scientific literature.
1611920	1616200	The date the west side highway, or any other piece of coastal infrastructure, actually
1616200	1622880	gets submerged is really not that relevant, because houses, highways, hospitals and railways
1622880	1626240	will be affected long before they are physically inundated.
1626240	1631560	Venice, for example, isn't yet under water, but floods are becoming more common with each
1631560	1635720	storm surge and each exceptionally high tide.
1635720	1640680	coastal areas and islands are increasingly having to deal with storm surges and salination,
1640680	1645600	which is why people are moving long before the water actually permanently covers their
1645600	1646600	homes.
1646600	1652240	I've looked at this in my video on the Maldives, busting yet another vlogger who did his own
1652240	1659200	research by reading spurious tabloid newspapers rather than scientific studies.
1659200	1663680	So if you're going to do your own research, first of all understand that geophysics is
1663680	1668480	a lot more complicated than just multiplying one number by another.
1668480	1674160	Secondly, if you want to do your own research to find out what scientific predictions are,
1674160	1680280	then read the scientific predictions, like the studies I've listed in the video description.
1680280	1686760	Don't just trust blogs, books, tweets and tabloids to tell you, because here's the shocker,
1686760	1689840	they aren't always accurate.
1689840	1695400	My thanks to all those who've been donating to this charity in order to support my channel.
1695400	1700560	Unlike many YouTubers and bloggers who are pushing their own junk research, I don't do
1700560	1703280	this for money and I don't ask for money.
1703280	1707920	I've had trouble naming the charity as the beneficiary of monetisation of this channel,
1707920	1713400	which is why it's still ad-free, but your generous contributions alone have now raised
1713400	1717560	nearly $200,000 for Health in Harmony.
1717560	1722160	Health in Harmony provides healthcare to communities near rainforests in exchange for
1722160	1727960	an end to logging, because the reason so many people cut down trees in this area is because
1727960	1730580	healthcare is unaffordable.
1730580	1736320	So it's a charity that saves lives, improves health and helps preserve the rainforest,
1736320	1740460	not to mention that your donation will encourage me to keep my channel going.
1740460	1744360	So it's a win, win, win, win.
1744360	1745280	You tired of winning yet?
