0	5280	Just a very quick message. Some posters informed me that four days after Tony Heller wrote his
5280	10800	third round response he added a supplementary response in which he talked about methane.
10800	14960	Needless to say there's not much in it, just a repetition of claims I'd already answered,
14960	20560	and more appeals to his own authority. Quite easy to rebut, but it came out after I'd written my
20560	25520	third round video. I'm not going to have a debate in dribs and drabs, it's going to get very
25520	30720	confusing, so I'll respond to Tony's methane claims along with his fourth round response
30720	36320	whenever he posts that. In future, Tony, please put all your thoughts together in one response.
36320	39840	Like I said, you don't have to rush it out in one day. Take your time.
