Just a very quick message. Some posters informed me that four days after Tony Heller wrote his

2
00:00:05,280 --> 00:00:10,800
third round response he added a supplementary response in which he talked about methane.

3
00:00:10,800 --> 00:00:14,960
Needless to say there's not much in it, just a repetition of claims I'd already answered,

4
00:00:14,960 --> 00:00:20,560
and more appeals to his own authority. Quite easy to rebut, but it came out after I'd written my

5
00:00:20,560 --> 00:00:25,520
third round video. I'm not going to have a debate in dribs and drabs, it's going to get very

6
00:00:25,520 --> 00:00:30,720
confusing, so I'll respond to Tony's methane claims along with his fourth round response

7
00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:36,320
whenever he posts that. In future, Tony, please put all your thoughts together in one response.

00:00:36,320 --> 00:00:39,840
Like I said, you don't have to rush it out in one day. Take your time.
