Just a very quick message. Some posters informed me that four days after Tony Heller wrote his
third round response he added a supplementary response in which he talked about methane.
Needless to say there's not much in it, just a repetition of claims I'd already answered,
and more appeals to his own authority. Quite easy to rebut, but it came out after I'd written my
third round video. I'm not going to have a debate in dribs and drabs, it's going to get very
confusing, so I'll respond to Tony's methane claims along with his fourth round response
whenever he posts that. In future, Tony, please put all your thoughts together in one response.
Like I said, you don't have to rush it out in one day. Take your time.
