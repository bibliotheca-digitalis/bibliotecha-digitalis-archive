00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:17,600
My last video, Human Evolution Made Easy, showed how mitochondrial DNA can be used to

2
00:00:17,600 --> 00:00:23,920
trace our most recent common matrilineal female ancestor, who lived about 150,000 years ago

3
00:00:23,920 --> 00:00:24,920
in Africa.

4
00:00:24,920 --> 00:00:29,880
But the same can be done for markers on the Y chromosome, which are only passed from father

5
00:00:29,880 --> 00:00:30,880
to son.

6
00:00:30,880 --> 00:00:37,000
Our most recent common male ancestor also lived in Africa, but much later, around 60,000

7
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:38,560
years ago.

8
00:00:38,560 --> 00:00:43,480
This video will look at what happened next, and how we know that these ancestors migrated

9
00:00:43,480 --> 00:00:47,600
out of Africa, and the routes they took to colonise the world.

10
00:00:47,600 --> 00:00:52,120
To understand that evidence, we first need to understand these DNA markers.

11
00:00:52,120 --> 00:00:57,240
DNA consists of two intertwining strands, which are basically joined up chemicals called

12
00:00:57,240 --> 00:00:58,880
nucleotides.

13
00:00:58,880 --> 00:01:04,400
Just four different types of nucleotide are found on each strand, adenine, thymine, cytosine

14
00:01:04,400 --> 00:01:05,760
and guanine.

15
00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:11,320
To glue the two strands together, adenine always pairs with thymine, and cytosine always

16
00:01:11,320 --> 00:01:15,800
pairs with guanine, that's just the nature of their chemical bonds.

17
00:01:15,800 --> 00:01:21,280
When DNA copies itself, the copies aren't always perfect, so sometimes the wrong nucleotide

18
00:01:21,280 --> 00:01:25,680
will be put in place, in this case adenine instead of cytosine.

19
00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:30,360
If that isn't corrected, the pairing nucleotide will also be wrong, so you've got yourself

20
00:01:30,360 --> 00:01:32,560
a mutation, a marker.

21
00:01:32,560 --> 00:01:37,200
If the marker is on mitochondrial DNA, that marker will be passed down through every female

22
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:39,580
descendant without alteration.

23
00:01:39,580 --> 00:01:44,040
If it's on Y chromosome DNA, it'll be passed down through every male descendant without

24
00:01:44,040 --> 00:01:45,520
alteration.

25
00:01:45,520 --> 00:01:50,640
So if we find a marker in people today, we can trace it back through thousands of generations

26
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:53,360
to find out when and where it started.

27
00:01:53,360 --> 00:01:56,120
Now imagine if all these people were migrating.

28
00:01:56,120 --> 00:02:01,440
This group stays put, this group moves north, and in this group, headed east, a baby boy

29
00:02:01,440 --> 00:02:05,000
is born with a unique marker on his Y chromosome.

30
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:09,300
The baby grows up and has male children, who also carry the same marker.

31
00:02:09,300 --> 00:02:14,680
As the group continues its migration, some tribes settle and others keep moving eastwards.

32
00:02:14,680 --> 00:02:19,040
Like a leaky boat, the movement leaves in its wake a trail of descendants with the red

33
00:02:19,040 --> 00:02:20,960
genetic marker.

34
00:02:20,960 --> 00:02:26,560
So by checking the DNA of people living today, we find those with the same genetic markers.

35
00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:31,840
This map shows the distribution of men with a marker on their Y chromosome called M130.

36
00:02:31,840 --> 00:02:36,320
We can wind this film backwards and follow the migration route they took, which was the

37
00:02:36,320 --> 00:02:40,740
first complete one out of Africa around 60,000 years ago.

38
00:02:40,740 --> 00:02:45,640
That was the basis for the study conducted by Spencer Wells and others in 2000, which

39
00:02:45,640 --> 00:02:50,360
involved collecting DNA samples from indigenous people all over the world.

40
00:02:50,360 --> 00:02:55,400
Wells found distinctive genetic markers and traced each back to its source, marked here

41
00:02:55,400 --> 00:02:57,200
by red circles.

42
00:02:57,200 --> 00:03:03,080
We're retracing the migration paths our ancestors took backwards through time, and this is where

43
00:03:03,080 --> 00:03:06,680
they started once again in Africa.

44
00:03:06,680 --> 00:03:11,320
Because the mutations happen at a fairly regular rate, these ancestral markers can even be

45
00:03:11,320 --> 00:03:17,080
dated, so the time scale on this map marks the progress of each migration.

46
00:03:17,080 --> 00:03:21,600
Markers that stay put and don't migrate will, of course, have a lot more of these genetic

47
00:03:21,600 --> 00:03:27,320
markers, so it's not surprising that we find the greatest genetic diversity in Africa.

48
00:03:27,320 --> 00:03:32,300
But the greatest of all belongs to a people whose ancestral homeland once extended from

49
00:03:32,300 --> 00:03:34,920
South Africa to the Rift Valley.

50
00:03:34,920 --> 00:03:39,800
Wherever you're from in the world, whatever mitochondrial or Y chromosome DNA markers

51
00:03:39,800 --> 00:03:45,480
you have, you can trace your ancestry back to the people whose modern descendants are

52
00:03:45,480 --> 00:03:52,480
the sand, the bushmen, the living embodiment of all modern humans.

53
00:04:16,480 --> 00:04:22,400
The DNA evidence coincides perfectly with climatological evidence that shows these migrations

54
00:04:22,400 --> 00:04:26,960
occurred when East Africa was wetter and the Sahara was a savannah.

55
00:04:26,960 --> 00:04:31,720
Humans followed, migrating herds across it, but when the climate became drier, the Sahara

56
00:04:31,720 --> 00:04:33,080
turned to desert.

57
00:04:33,080 --> 00:04:36,040
Effectively, it slammed shut like a gate.

58
00:04:36,040 --> 00:04:41,080
When the Saharan climate improved again, DNA evidence, coincidentally, shows a second great

59
00:04:41,080 --> 00:04:42,520
migration.

60
00:04:42,520 --> 00:04:44,040
This was the big one.

61
00:04:44,040 --> 00:04:48,880
Our ancestors moved into the heart of Europe and Asia, then later across a land bridge

62
00:04:48,880 --> 00:04:50,720
into the Americas.

63
00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:54,960
Wherever they went, humans adapted to the climate and new diets.

64
00:04:54,960 --> 00:04:58,940
People moving into northern climates lost the melanin in their skins.

65
00:04:58,940 --> 00:05:02,400
Melanin inhibits the production of vitamin D by sunlight.

66
00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:07,860
That's no problem in sunny Africa, but a drawback in northern latitudes.

67
00:05:07,860 --> 00:05:11,960
As long as they were moving and opening up new territory, there was plenty of space for

68
00:05:11,960 --> 00:05:14,560
excess populations to expand.

69
00:05:14,560 --> 00:05:20,000
But around 20,000 years ago, the human diaspora had filled nearly every continent.

70
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:22,520
Settled populations began to grow.

71
00:05:22,520 --> 00:05:26,900
What we learned in primary school is that Stone Age humans were hunter-gatherers living

72
00:05:26,900 --> 00:05:32,040
in small tribes, then all of a sudden they discovered farming, settled down, built towns,

73
00:05:32,040 --> 00:05:33,880
and invented writing.

74
00:05:33,880 --> 00:05:38,680
But if humans had been around for over 100,000 years, why did they suddenly become civilized

75
00:05:38,680 --> 00:05:41,440
in different parts of the world at the same time?

76
00:05:41,440 --> 00:05:46,320
Fundamentalists point to this primary school explanation as proof that our species is very

77
00:05:46,320 --> 00:05:47,600
young.

78
00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:52,360
But of course, if you don't look beyond simplified explanations, you never gain more than a simplified

79
00:05:52,360 --> 00:05:54,480
understanding.

80
00:05:54,480 --> 00:05:58,560
Archaeologists don't see civilization as something that appeared out of the blue, like a light

81
00:05:58,560 --> 00:06:01,400
suddenly banishing the darkness of the Stone Age.

82
00:06:01,400 --> 00:06:05,960
Instead, they see increasingly complex and hierarchical societies.

83
00:06:05,960 --> 00:06:10,720
In Europe and the Middle East, people were living in semi-permanent settlements 20,000

84
00:06:10,720 --> 00:06:16,280
years before the first pyramids were built, and 12,000 years before farming was discovered.

85
00:06:16,280 --> 00:06:21,240
They had art, culture, religion, medicine, and a growing technology.

86
00:06:21,240 --> 00:06:26,200
They mass-produced beads and mined obsidian and flint for export, then transported them

87
00:06:26,200 --> 00:06:28,480
over extensive trading routes.

88
00:06:28,480 --> 00:06:33,240
They criss-crossed the Mediterranean in trading boats, and far from having lives that were

89
00:06:33,240 --> 00:06:38,720
nasty, brutish, and short, most of them lived to be grandparents and enjoyed healthy food

90
00:06:38,720 --> 00:06:40,120
surpluses.

91
00:06:40,120 --> 00:06:44,880
Even 6,000 years before farming was introduced, people in northern Mesopotamia were living

92
00:06:44,880 --> 00:06:47,360
in sophisticated settlements.

93
00:06:47,360 --> 00:06:51,440
This is a temple complex dating back 11,000 years.

94
00:06:51,440 --> 00:06:55,920
Further south, the people called the Natufians were also living in permanent villages, and

95
00:06:55,920 --> 00:06:58,120
there's evidence they stored grain.

96
00:06:58,120 --> 00:07:00,740
But then came the next big change.

97
00:07:00,740 --> 00:07:03,160
In the Middle East, the climate dried.

98
00:07:03,160 --> 00:07:07,280
Whether people began planting crops because they'd become scarce in the wild, or whether

99
00:07:07,280 --> 00:07:12,740
scattered populations had to congregate around oases and rivers because water was scarce,

100
00:07:12,740 --> 00:07:16,940
whatever the case, farming seems to have begun out of necessity.

101
00:07:16,940 --> 00:07:22,080
Over several hundred years it took hold in Mesopotamia and the Yellow River Valley, apparently

102
00:07:22,080 --> 00:07:23,280
independently.

103
00:07:23,280 --> 00:07:28,440
It took a thousand more years for the practice to spread via trade routes to the Indus Valley,

104
00:07:28,440 --> 00:07:31,300
the Nile Valley, and other parts of Eurasia.

105
00:07:31,300 --> 00:07:33,680
But the payoff from farming was huge.

106
00:07:33,680 --> 00:07:38,760
It opened the way for larger settlements, technological innovation, and accelerated

107
00:07:38,760 --> 00:07:41,000
trade and writing.

108
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:46,400
The motivation of these megalithic and neolithic people may always be debatable, but nothing

109
00:07:46,400 --> 00:07:49,440
contradicts the hard evidence of DNA.

110
00:07:49,440 --> 00:07:54,680
Tracing our ancestry uses exactly the same techniques used in determining paternity and

111
00:07:54,680 --> 00:07:56,420
convicting criminals.

112
00:07:56,420 --> 00:08:00,960
If fundamentalists want to reject the techniques that prove our origins and migrations out

113
00:08:00,960 --> 00:08:06,120
of Africa, then they have to reject the same DNA techniques that help convict rapists and

114
00:08:06,120 --> 00:08:07,120
murderers.

115
00:08:07,120 --> 00:08:10,240
Now that's a tough call for evangelical preachers.

116
00:08:10,240 --> 00:08:15,880
The DNA evidence also fits perfectly with the climatological and archaeological evidence.

117
00:08:15,880 --> 00:08:21,160
We have a lot more to learn, but we do at least know how we got here.

118
00:08:21,160 --> 00:08:25,520
And so we come to the present day, having traced our origins in this series all the

119
00:08:25,520 --> 00:08:27,720
way from the Big Bang.

120
00:08:27,720 --> 00:08:31,040
Of course, to use a cliche, this is all ancient history.

121
00:08:31,040 --> 00:08:35,320
But to those with a yearning to know who they are and where they came from, it's a history

122
00:08:35,320 --> 00:08:37,360
that made us who we are.

123
00:08:37,360 --> 00:08:42,480
To understand that, just look at Britain's oldest complete skeleton, 9,000-year-old Cheddar

124
00:08:42,480 --> 00:08:43,480
Man.

125
00:08:43,480 --> 00:08:49,160
In 1997, DNA was taken from the skeleton and compared to people from the area.

126
00:08:49,160 --> 00:08:54,000
They discovered one of Cheddar Man's direct descendants, a schoolteacher, living just

127
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:56,400
half a mile from where the skeleton was found.
