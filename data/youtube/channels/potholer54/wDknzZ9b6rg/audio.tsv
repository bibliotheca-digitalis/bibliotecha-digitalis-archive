0	17600	My last video, Human Evolution Made Easy, showed how mitochondrial DNA can be used to
17600	23920	trace our most recent common matrilineal female ancestor, who lived about 150,000 years ago
23920	24920	in Africa.
24920	29880	But the same can be done for markers on the Y chromosome, which are only passed from father
29880	30880	to son.
30880	37000	Our most recent common male ancestor also lived in Africa, but much later, around 60,000
37000	38560	years ago.
38560	43480	This video will look at what happened next, and how we know that these ancestors migrated
43480	47600	out of Africa, and the routes they took to colonise the world.
47600	52120	To understand that evidence, we first need to understand these DNA markers.
52120	57240	DNA consists of two intertwining strands, which are basically joined up chemicals called
57240	58880	nucleotides.
58880	64400	Just four different types of nucleotide are found on each strand, adenine, thymine, cytosine
64400	65760	and guanine.
65760	71320	To glue the two strands together, adenine always pairs with thymine, and cytosine always
71320	75800	pairs with guanine, that's just the nature of their chemical bonds.
75800	81280	When DNA copies itself, the copies aren't always perfect, so sometimes the wrong nucleotide
81280	85680	will be put in place, in this case adenine instead of cytosine.
85680	90360	If that isn't corrected, the pairing nucleotide will also be wrong, so you've got yourself
90360	92560	a mutation, a marker.
92560	97200	If the marker is on mitochondrial DNA, that marker will be passed down through every female
97200	99580	descendant without alteration.
99580	104040	If it's on Y chromosome DNA, it'll be passed down through every male descendant without
104040	105520	alteration.
105520	110640	So if we find a marker in people today, we can trace it back through thousands of generations
110640	113360	to find out when and where it started.
113360	116120	Now imagine if all these people were migrating.
116120	121440	This group stays put, this group moves north, and in this group, headed east, a baby boy
121440	125000	is born with a unique marker on his Y chromosome.
125000	129300	The baby grows up and has male children, who also carry the same marker.
129300	134680	As the group continues its migration, some tribes settle and others keep moving eastwards.
134680	139040	Like a leaky boat, the movement leaves in its wake a trail of descendants with the red
139040	140960	genetic marker.
140960	146560	So by checking the DNA of people living today, we find those with the same genetic markers.
146560	151840	This map shows the distribution of men with a marker on their Y chromosome called M130.
151840	156320	We can wind this film backwards and follow the migration route they took, which was the
156320	160740	first complete one out of Africa around 60,000 years ago.
160740	165640	That was the basis for the study conducted by Spencer Wells and others in 2000, which
165640	170360	involved collecting DNA samples from indigenous people all over the world.
170360	175400	Wells found distinctive genetic markers and traced each back to its source, marked here
175400	177200	by red circles.
177200	183080	We're retracing the migration paths our ancestors took backwards through time, and this is where
183080	186680	they started once again in Africa.
186680	191320	Because the mutations happen at a fairly regular rate, these ancestral markers can even be
191320	197080	dated, so the time scale on this map marks the progress of each migration.
197080	201600	Markers that stay put and don't migrate will, of course, have a lot more of these genetic
201600	207320	markers, so it's not surprising that we find the greatest genetic diversity in Africa.
207320	212300	But the greatest of all belongs to a people whose ancestral homeland once extended from
212300	214920	South Africa to the Rift Valley.
214920	219800	Wherever you're from in the world, whatever mitochondrial or Y chromosome DNA markers
219800	225480	you have, you can trace your ancestry back to the people whose modern descendants are
225480	232480	the sand, the bushmen, the living embodiment of all modern humans.
256480	262400	The DNA evidence coincides perfectly with climatological evidence that shows these migrations
262400	266960	occurred when East Africa was wetter and the Sahara was a savannah.
266960	271720	Humans followed, migrating herds across it, but when the climate became drier, the Sahara
271720	273080	turned to desert.
273080	276040	Effectively, it slammed shut like a gate.
276040	281080	When the Saharan climate improved again, DNA evidence, coincidentally, shows a second great
281080	282520	migration.
282520	284040	This was the big one.
284040	288880	Our ancestors moved into the heart of Europe and Asia, then later across a land bridge
288880	290720	into the Americas.
290720	294960	Wherever they went, humans adapted to the climate and new diets.
294960	298940	People moving into northern climates lost the melanin in their skins.
298940	302400	Melanin inhibits the production of vitamin D by sunlight.
302400	307860	That's no problem in sunny Africa, but a drawback in northern latitudes.
307860	311960	As long as they were moving and opening up new territory, there was plenty of space for
311960	314560	excess populations to expand.
314560	320000	But around 20,000 years ago, the human diaspora had filled nearly every continent.
320000	322520	Settled populations began to grow.
322520	326900	What we learned in primary school is that Stone Age humans were hunter-gatherers living
326900	332040	in small tribes, then all of a sudden they discovered farming, settled down, built towns,
332040	333880	and invented writing.
333880	338680	But if humans had been around for over 100,000 years, why did they suddenly become civilized
338680	341440	in different parts of the world at the same time?
341440	346320	Fundamentalists point to this primary school explanation as proof that our species is very
346320	347600	young.
347600	352360	But of course, if you don't look beyond simplified explanations, you never gain more than a simplified
352360	354480	understanding.
354480	358560	Archaeologists don't see civilization as something that appeared out of the blue, like a light
358560	361400	suddenly banishing the darkness of the Stone Age.
361400	365960	Instead, they see increasingly complex and hierarchical societies.
365960	370720	In Europe and the Middle East, people were living in semi-permanent settlements 20,000
370720	376280	years before the first pyramids were built, and 12,000 years before farming was discovered.
376280	381240	They had art, culture, religion, medicine, and a growing technology.
381240	386200	They mass-produced beads and mined obsidian and flint for export, then transported them
386200	388480	over extensive trading routes.
388480	393240	They criss-crossed the Mediterranean in trading boats, and far from having lives that were
393240	398720	nasty, brutish, and short, most of them lived to be grandparents and enjoyed healthy food
398720	400120	surpluses.
400120	404880	Even 6,000 years before farming was introduced, people in northern Mesopotamia were living
404880	407360	in sophisticated settlements.
407360	411440	This is a temple complex dating back 11,000 years.
411440	415920	Further south, the people called the Natufians were also living in permanent villages, and
415920	418120	there's evidence they stored grain.
418120	420740	But then came the next big change.
420740	423160	In the Middle East, the climate dried.
423160	427280	Whether people began planting crops because they'd become scarce in the wild, or whether
427280	432740	scattered populations had to congregate around oases and rivers because water was scarce,
432740	436940	whatever the case, farming seems to have begun out of necessity.
436940	442080	Over several hundred years it took hold in Mesopotamia and the Yellow River Valley, apparently
442080	443280	independently.
443280	448440	It took a thousand more years for the practice to spread via trade routes to the Indus Valley,
448440	451300	the Nile Valley, and other parts of Eurasia.
451300	453680	But the payoff from farming was huge.
453680	458760	It opened the way for larger settlements, technological innovation, and accelerated
458760	461000	trade and writing.
461000	466400	The motivation of these megalithic and neolithic people may always be debatable, but nothing
466400	469440	contradicts the hard evidence of DNA.
469440	474680	Tracing our ancestry uses exactly the same techniques used in determining paternity and
474680	476420	convicting criminals.
476420	480960	If fundamentalists want to reject the techniques that prove our origins and migrations out
480960	486120	of Africa, then they have to reject the same DNA techniques that help convict rapists and
486120	487120	murderers.
487120	490240	Now that's a tough call for evangelical preachers.
490240	495880	The DNA evidence also fits perfectly with the climatological and archaeological evidence.
495880	501160	We have a lot more to learn, but we do at least know how we got here.
501160	505520	And so we come to the present day, having traced our origins in this series all the
505520	507720	way from the Big Bang.
507720	511040	Of course, to use a cliche, this is all ancient history.
511040	515320	But to those with a yearning to know who they are and where they came from, it's a history
515320	517360	that made us who we are.
517360	522480	To understand that, just look at Britain's oldest complete skeleton, 9,000-year-old Cheddar
522480	523480	Man.
523480	529160	In 1997, DNA was taken from the skeleton and compared to people from the area.
529160	534000	They discovered one of Cheddar Man's direct descendants, a schoolteacher, living just
534000	536400	half a mile from where the skeleton was found.
