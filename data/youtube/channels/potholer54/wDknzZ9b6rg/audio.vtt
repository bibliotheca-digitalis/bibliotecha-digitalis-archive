00:00.000 --> 00:17.600
My last video, Human Evolution Made Easy, showed how mitochondrial DNA can be used to

00:17.600 --> 00:23.920
trace our most recent common matrilineal female ancestor, who lived about 150,000 years ago

00:23.920 --> 00:24.920
in Africa.

00:24.920 --> 00:29.880
But the same can be done for markers on the Y chromosome, which are only passed from father

00:29.880 --> 00:30.880
to son.

00:30.880 --> 00:37.000
Our most recent common male ancestor also lived in Africa, but much later, around 60,000

00:37.000 --> 00:38.560
years ago.

00:38.560 --> 00:43.480
This video will look at what happened next, and how we know that these ancestors migrated

00:43.480 --> 00:47.600
out of Africa, and the routes they took to colonise the world.

00:47.600 --> 00:52.120
To understand that evidence, we first need to understand these DNA markers.

00:52.120 --> 00:57.240
DNA consists of two intertwining strands, which are basically joined up chemicals called

00:57.240 --> 00:58.880
nucleotides.

00:58.880 --> 01:04.400
Just four different types of nucleotide are found on each strand, adenine, thymine, cytosine

01:04.400 --> 01:05.760
and guanine.

01:05.760 --> 01:11.320
To glue the two strands together, adenine always pairs with thymine, and cytosine always

01:11.320 --> 01:15.800
pairs with guanine, that's just the nature of their chemical bonds.

01:15.800 --> 01:21.280
When DNA copies itself, the copies aren't always perfect, so sometimes the wrong nucleotide

01:21.280 --> 01:25.680
will be put in place, in this case adenine instead of cytosine.

01:25.680 --> 01:30.360
If that isn't corrected, the pairing nucleotide will also be wrong, so you've got yourself

01:30.360 --> 01:32.560
a mutation, a marker.

01:32.560 --> 01:37.200
If the marker is on mitochondrial DNA, that marker will be passed down through every female

01:37.200 --> 01:39.580
descendant without alteration.

01:39.580 --> 01:44.040
If it's on Y chromosome DNA, it'll be passed down through every male descendant without

01:44.040 --> 01:45.520
alteration.

01:45.520 --> 01:50.640
So if we find a marker in people today, we can trace it back through thousands of generations

01:50.640 --> 01:53.360
to find out when and where it started.

01:53.360 --> 01:56.120
Now imagine if all these people were migrating.

01:56.120 --> 02:01.440
This group stays put, this group moves north, and in this group, headed east, a baby boy

02:01.440 --> 02:05.000
is born with a unique marker on his Y chromosome.

02:05.000 --> 02:09.300
The baby grows up and has male children, who also carry the same marker.

02:09.300 --> 02:14.680
As the group continues its migration, some tribes settle and others keep moving eastwards.

02:14.680 --> 02:19.040
Like a leaky boat, the movement leaves in its wake a trail of descendants with the red

02:19.040 --> 02:20.960
genetic marker.

02:20.960 --> 02:26.560
So by checking the DNA of people living today, we find those with the same genetic markers.

02:26.560 --> 02:31.840
This map shows the distribution of men with a marker on their Y chromosome called M130.

02:31.840 --> 02:36.320
We can wind this film backwards and follow the migration route they took, which was the

02:36.320 --> 02:40.740
first complete one out of Africa around 60,000 years ago.

02:40.740 --> 02:45.640
That was the basis for the study conducted by Spencer Wells and others in 2000, which

02:45.640 --> 02:50.360
involved collecting DNA samples from indigenous people all over the world.

02:50.360 --> 02:55.400
Wells found distinctive genetic markers and traced each back to its source, marked here

02:55.400 --> 02:57.200
by red circles.

02:57.200 --> 03:03.080
We're retracing the migration paths our ancestors took backwards through time, and this is where

03:03.080 --> 03:06.680
they started once again in Africa.

03:06.680 --> 03:11.320
Because the mutations happen at a fairly regular rate, these ancestral markers can even be

03:11.320 --> 03:17.080
dated, so the time scale on this map marks the progress of each migration.

03:17.080 --> 03:21.600
Markers that stay put and don't migrate will, of course, have a lot more of these genetic

03:21.600 --> 03:27.320
markers, so it's not surprising that we find the greatest genetic diversity in Africa.

03:27.320 --> 03:32.300
But the greatest of all belongs to a people whose ancestral homeland once extended from

03:32.300 --> 03:34.920
South Africa to the Rift Valley.

03:34.920 --> 03:39.800
Wherever you're from in the world, whatever mitochondrial or Y chromosome DNA markers

03:39.800 --> 03:45.480
you have, you can trace your ancestry back to the people whose modern descendants are

03:45.480 --> 03:52.480
the sand, the bushmen, the living embodiment of all modern humans.

04:16.480 --> 04:22.400
The DNA evidence coincides perfectly with climatological evidence that shows these migrations

04:22.400 --> 04:26.960
occurred when East Africa was wetter and the Sahara was a savannah.

04:26.960 --> 04:31.720
Humans followed, migrating herds across it, but when the climate became drier, the Sahara

04:31.720 --> 04:33.080
turned to desert.

04:33.080 --> 04:36.040
Effectively, it slammed shut like a gate.

04:36.040 --> 04:41.080
When the Saharan climate improved again, DNA evidence, coincidentally, shows a second great

04:41.080 --> 04:42.520
migration.

04:42.520 --> 04:44.040
This was the big one.

04:44.040 --> 04:48.880
Our ancestors moved into the heart of Europe and Asia, then later across a land bridge

04:48.880 --> 04:50.720
into the Americas.

04:50.720 --> 04:54.960
Wherever they went, humans adapted to the climate and new diets.

04:54.960 --> 04:58.940
People moving into northern climates lost the melanin in their skins.

04:58.940 --> 05:02.400
Melanin inhibits the production of vitamin D by sunlight.

05:02.400 --> 05:07.860
That's no problem in sunny Africa, but a drawback in northern latitudes.

05:07.860 --> 05:11.960
As long as they were moving and opening up new territory, there was plenty of space for

05:11.960 --> 05:14.560
excess populations to expand.

05:14.560 --> 05:20.000
But around 20,000 years ago, the human diaspora had filled nearly every continent.

05:20.000 --> 05:22.520
Settled populations began to grow.

05:22.520 --> 05:26.900
What we learned in primary school is that Stone Age humans were hunter-gatherers living

05:26.900 --> 05:32.040
in small tribes, then all of a sudden they discovered farming, settled down, built towns,

05:32.040 --> 05:33.880
and invented writing.

05:33.880 --> 05:38.680
But if humans had been around for over 100,000 years, why did they suddenly become civilized

05:38.680 --> 05:41.440
in different parts of the world at the same time?

05:41.440 --> 05:46.320
Fundamentalists point to this primary school explanation as proof that our species is very

05:46.320 --> 05:47.600
young.

05:47.600 --> 05:52.360
But of course, if you don't look beyond simplified explanations, you never gain more than a simplified

05:52.360 --> 05:54.480
understanding.

05:54.480 --> 05:58.560
Archaeologists don't see civilization as something that appeared out of the blue, like a light

05:58.560 --> 06:01.400
suddenly banishing the darkness of the Stone Age.

06:01.400 --> 06:05.960
Instead, they see increasingly complex and hierarchical societies.

06:05.960 --> 06:10.720
In Europe and the Middle East, people were living in semi-permanent settlements 20,000

06:10.720 --> 06:16.280
years before the first pyramids were built, and 12,000 years before farming was discovered.

06:16.280 --> 06:21.240
They had art, culture, religion, medicine, and a growing technology.

06:21.240 --> 06:26.200
They mass-produced beads and mined obsidian and flint for export, then transported them

06:26.200 --> 06:28.480
over extensive trading routes.

06:28.480 --> 06:33.240
They criss-crossed the Mediterranean in trading boats, and far from having lives that were

06:33.240 --> 06:38.720
nasty, brutish, and short, most of them lived to be grandparents and enjoyed healthy food

06:38.720 --> 06:40.120
surpluses.

06:40.120 --> 06:44.880
Even 6,000 years before farming was introduced, people in northern Mesopotamia were living

06:44.880 --> 06:47.360
in sophisticated settlements.

06:47.360 --> 06:51.440
This is a temple complex dating back 11,000 years.

06:51.440 --> 06:55.920
Further south, the people called the Natufians were also living in permanent villages, and

06:55.920 --> 06:58.120
there's evidence they stored grain.

06:58.120 --> 07:00.740
But then came the next big change.

07:00.740 --> 07:03.160
In the Middle East, the climate dried.

07:03.160 --> 07:07.280
Whether people began planting crops because they'd become scarce in the wild, or whether

07:07.280 --> 07:12.740
scattered populations had to congregate around oases and rivers because water was scarce,

07:12.740 --> 07:16.940
whatever the case, farming seems to have begun out of necessity.

07:16.940 --> 07:22.080
Over several hundred years it took hold in Mesopotamia and the Yellow River Valley, apparently

07:22.080 --> 07:23.280
independently.

07:23.280 --> 07:28.440
It took a thousand more years for the practice to spread via trade routes to the Indus Valley,

07:28.440 --> 07:31.300
the Nile Valley, and other parts of Eurasia.

07:31.300 --> 07:33.680
But the payoff from farming was huge.

07:33.680 --> 07:38.760
It opened the way for larger settlements, technological innovation, and accelerated

07:38.760 --> 07:41.000
trade and writing.

07:41.000 --> 07:46.400
The motivation of these megalithic and neolithic people may always be debatable, but nothing

07:46.400 --> 07:49.440
contradicts the hard evidence of DNA.

07:49.440 --> 07:54.680
Tracing our ancestry uses exactly the same techniques used in determining paternity and

07:54.680 --> 07:56.420
convicting criminals.

07:56.420 --> 08:00.960
If fundamentalists want to reject the techniques that prove our origins and migrations out

08:00.960 --> 08:06.120
of Africa, then they have to reject the same DNA techniques that help convict rapists and

08:06.120 --> 08:07.120
murderers.

08:07.120 --> 08:10.240
Now that's a tough call for evangelical preachers.

08:10.240 --> 08:15.880
The DNA evidence also fits perfectly with the climatological and archaeological evidence.

08:15.880 --> 08:21.160
We have a lot more to learn, but we do at least know how we got here.

08:21.160 --> 08:25.520
And so we come to the present day, having traced our origins in this series all the

08:25.520 --> 08:27.720
way from the Big Bang.

08:27.720 --> 08:31.040
Of course, to use a cliche, this is all ancient history.

08:31.040 --> 08:35.320
But to those with a yearning to know who they are and where they came from, it's a history

08:35.320 --> 08:37.360
that made us who we are.

08:37.360 --> 08:42.480
To understand that, just look at Britain's oldest complete skeleton, 9,000-year-old Cheddar

08:42.480 --> 08:43.480
Man.

08:43.480 --> 08:49.160
In 1997, DNA was taken from the skeleton and compared to people from the area.

08:49.160 --> 08:54.000
They discovered one of Cheddar Man's direct descendants, a schoolteacher, living just

08:54.000 --> 08:56.400
half a mile from where the skeleton was found.
