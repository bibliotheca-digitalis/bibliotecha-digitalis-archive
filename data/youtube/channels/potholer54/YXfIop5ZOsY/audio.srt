1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
When I was a kid I went to church and learned how God had made us all.

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:08,000
Later I learned how he did it and it was brilliant.

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:10,000
His design is called DNA.

4
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:15,000
A father's DNA combines with a mother's DNA to make a kind of blueprint.

5
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:21,000
This DNA replicates itself and ensures that the tiny fetus grows into a perfect baby,

6
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:23,000
just the way God intended.

7
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:26,000
We call this intelligent design.

8
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:31,000
The designer is a perfect being, which is why his design is so perfect.

9
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:36,000
Someone once told me, if you want proof of God, just look at your hand.

10
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:39,000
Well okay, not that hand.

11
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:41,000
Not that hand either.

12
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:48,000
But when I was younger I did take a look at hands and noticed that they're not all shining examples of the perfect work of God.

13
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:52,000
This is an example of polydactyly, which is a genetic abnormality.

14
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:56,000
It means the DNA copy has been badly executed.

15
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,000
And it's not just the hands.

16
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:04,000
The problem I later discovered is that when DNA replicates itself, it sometimes makes imperfect copies.

17
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:07,000
These cause deformities and diseases.

18
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:12,000
Sometimes they're apparent from birth, other times they manifest themselves later in life.

19
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:17,000
Now if God designed our replication system, there has to be an explanation.

20
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:23,000
No, we're not talking about diseases like typhoid, HIV or hepatitis.

21
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:28,000
These are diseases and abnormalities that result from God's own replication system.

22
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:31,000
A system He designed.

23
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:37,000
Which is a pretty strange thing for a loving God to want to do. Why?

24
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:40,000
No, that doesn't make any sense.

25
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:46,000
These genetic diseases and deformities strike Christians, Muslims, Hindus, Buddhists and atheists alike.

26
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:51,000
Christian Filipinos don't get tested any more than Muslim Filipinos.

27
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:56,000
Then why aren't all babies deformed?

28
00:01:56,000 --> 00:02:00,000
Ten percent of five-year-old children have some form of congenital abnormality.

29
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,000
And that's a lot.

30
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:07,000
But if babies are sinners, why don't we all get these abnormalities and in equal measure?

31
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:10,000
Some abnormalities are worse than others.

32
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:14,000
But animals get exactly the same abnormalities too.

33
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:18,000
They don't have original sin. Why are they being punished?

34
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,000
Ah, maybe they will.

35
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:30,000
But that doesn't tell us why God has designed a replication system that's deliberately or even accidentally flawed.

36
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,000
What's the point?

37
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:38,000
It's very easy for us, living comfortable lives, to say it doesn't matter if these children suffer during their time on earth.

38
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:43,000
But it matters to Him and to her and them.

39
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:48,000
But God is supposed to be immeasurably wise, perfect and powerful.

40
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:52,000
We can treat some of these diseases and fix a lot of the deformities.

41
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:56,000
Spina bifida can be prevented with a simple dose of folic acid.

42
00:02:56,000 --> 00:03:01,000
If babies with cleft palates get surgery early on, they grow up perfectly healthy and happy.

43
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:05,000
Why couldn't God just fix the problems right from the start?

44
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:09,000
Ah, yes. When all else fails, blame Satan.

45
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:14,000
But the devil would have to step in and physically change the chemical make-up of DNA,

46
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:19,000
not just once but millions of times, to create mutations that lead to genetic disorders.

47
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:22,000
How? That's an incredible feat.

48
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:27,000
And if God made a perfect system, how can something less powerful manage to change it?

49
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:30,000
But here's the real killer to this idea.

50
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:33,000
Different races get different genetic diseases.

51
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:37,000
This leads us to the very puzzling story of the sickle cell.

52
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:43,000
Sickle cell anaemia is a genetic disorder found almost exclusively in Africa and South Asia.

53
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:47,000
It wasn't confined to this area because Satan took a vacation there.

54
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:53,000
The sickle cell is a genetic mutation to the haemoglobin gene and it's there for a very good reason.

55
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:55,000
It's effective against malaria.

56
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:58,000
It's perfectly consistent with the idea of evolution,

57
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:02,000
because people with the mutation had some advantage in combating malaria.

58
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:05,000
Of course it can cause anaemia in some carriers,

59
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:11,000
but the evolutionary benefits of combating malaria outweigh the evolutionary disadvantages of anaemia.

60
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:14,000
So the gene thrives and gets passed on.

61
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:19,000
But if we go to the idea of intelligent design, the sickle cell makes no sense.

62
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:25,000
For a start, why would God want to protect only some people in the world against malaria and not others?

63
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:28,000
The natives of South America have no such protection.

64
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:34,000
And why, if God is trying to protect Africans and people in South Asia with this gene,

65
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:38,000
is the gene so defective that it has side effects?

66
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:42,000
The fact is that the DNA replication system is far from perfect

67
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:46,000
and sadly every baby that's born isn't a little miracle.

68
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:52,000
Some of these genetic defects are very old and affect the entire human population.

69
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:56,000
Others are more recent and affect races that share a genetic history.

70
00:04:56,000 --> 00:05:00,000
The oldest of the lot affect both humans and animals.

71
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:06,000
The DNA molecule is very large, which means its replication is often messy and flawed.

72
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:11,000
Every time DNA makes a copy of itself, some parts get miscopied.

73
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:15,000
Most of the time the imperfect copy is barely more than a nuisance to the individual.

74
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:20,000
A longer neck, a smaller nose, a bigger brain or a hairier body.

75
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:25,000
These traits may even be useful, so over time more individuals will inherit them.

76
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:30,000
But sometimes the bad copies produce gross abnormalities in animals as well as humans.

77
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:33,000
There's one final twist in the tale.

78
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:38,000
Recently the Human Genome Project mapped our DNA and located every active part of it.

79
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:44,000
But in between the active genes, the ones that get switched on and hopefully produce a perfect human copy,

80
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:47,000
there are thousands of inactive genes.

81
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:52,000
These are redundant, a throwback to traits that our ancestors had that we no longer require,

82
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:56,000
like a hairy body or a tail or a large number of nipples.

83
00:05:56,000 --> 00:06:01,000
Every now and again these genes get switched on, obviously by accident.

84
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:03,000
This isn't intelligent design.

85
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:07,000
There is of course overwhelming evidence that our genes are inherited,

86
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:11,000
that mutations are hit and miss and the successful ones get passed on.

87
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:13,000
That's how animals evolve.

88
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:17,000
If all this is design, then it's a bad design.

89
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:23,000
If it's deliberately a roll of the dice, then it has devastating consequences for some unlucky children.

90
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:25,000
It's anything but intelligent.
