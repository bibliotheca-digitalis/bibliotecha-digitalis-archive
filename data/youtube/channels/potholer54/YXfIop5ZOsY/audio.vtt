00:00.000 --> 00:05.000
When I was a kid I went to church and learned how God had made us all.

00:05.000 --> 00:08.000
Later I learned how he did it and it was brilliant.

00:08.000 --> 00:10.000
His design is called DNA.

00:10.000 --> 00:15.000
A father's DNA combines with a mother's DNA to make a kind of blueprint.

00:15.000 --> 00:21.000
This DNA replicates itself and ensures that the tiny fetus grows into a perfect baby,

00:21.000 --> 00:23.000
just the way God intended.

00:23.000 --> 00:26.000
We call this intelligent design.

00:26.000 --> 00:31.000
The designer is a perfect being, which is why his design is so perfect.

00:31.000 --> 00:36.000
Someone once told me, if you want proof of God, just look at your hand.

00:36.000 --> 00:39.000
Well okay, not that hand.

00:39.000 --> 00:41.000
Not that hand either.

00:41.000 --> 00:48.000
But when I was younger I did take a look at hands and noticed that they're not all shining examples of the perfect work of God.

00:48.000 --> 00:52.000
This is an example of polydactyly, which is a genetic abnormality.

00:52.000 --> 00:56.000
It means the DNA copy has been badly executed.

00:56.000 --> 00:58.000
And it's not just the hands.

00:58.000 --> 01:04.000
The problem I later discovered is that when DNA replicates itself, it sometimes makes imperfect copies.

01:04.000 --> 01:07.000
These cause deformities and diseases.

01:07.000 --> 01:12.000
Sometimes they're apparent from birth, other times they manifest themselves later in life.

01:12.000 --> 01:17.000
Now if God designed our replication system, there has to be an explanation.

01:18.000 --> 01:23.000
No, we're not talking about diseases like typhoid, HIV or hepatitis.

01:23.000 --> 01:28.000
These are diseases and abnormalities that result from God's own replication system.

01:28.000 --> 01:31.000
A system He designed.

01:32.000 --> 01:37.000
Which is a pretty strange thing for a loving God to want to do. Why?

01:38.000 --> 01:40.000
No, that doesn't make any sense.

01:40.000 --> 01:46.000
These genetic diseases and deformities strike Christians, Muslims, Hindus, Buddhists and atheists alike.

01:46.000 --> 01:51.000
Christian Filipinos don't get tested any more than Muslim Filipinos.

01:53.000 --> 01:56.000
Then why aren't all babies deformed?

01:56.000 --> 02:00.000
Ten percent of five-year-old children have some form of congenital abnormality.

02:00.000 --> 02:02.000
And that's a lot.

02:02.000 --> 02:07.000
But if babies are sinners, why don't we all get these abnormalities and in equal measure?

02:07.000 --> 02:10.000
Some abnormalities are worse than others.

02:11.000 --> 02:14.000
But animals get exactly the same abnormalities too.

02:14.000 --> 02:18.000
They don't have original sin. Why are they being punished?

02:22.000 --> 02:24.000
Ah, maybe they will.

02:24.000 --> 02:30.000
But that doesn't tell us why God has designed a replication system that's deliberately or even accidentally flawed.

02:30.000 --> 02:32.000
What's the point?

02:32.000 --> 02:38.000
It's very easy for us, living comfortable lives, to say it doesn't matter if these children suffer during their time on earth.

02:38.000 --> 02:43.000
But it matters to Him and to her and them.

02:44.000 --> 02:48.000
But God is supposed to be immeasurably wise, perfect and powerful.

02:48.000 --> 02:52.000
We can treat some of these diseases and fix a lot of the deformities.

02:52.000 --> 02:56.000
Spina bifida can be prevented with a simple dose of folic acid.

02:56.000 --> 03:01.000
If babies with cleft palates get surgery early on, they grow up perfectly healthy and happy.

03:01.000 --> 03:05.000
Why couldn't God just fix the problems right from the start?

03:05.000 --> 03:09.000
Ah, yes. When all else fails, blame Satan.

03:09.000 --> 03:14.000
But the devil would have to step in and physically change the chemical make-up of DNA,

03:14.000 --> 03:19.000
not just once but millions of times, to create mutations that lead to genetic disorders.

03:19.000 --> 03:22.000
How? That's an incredible feat.

03:22.000 --> 03:27.000
And if God made a perfect system, how can something less powerful manage to change it?

03:27.000 --> 03:30.000
But here's the real killer to this idea.

03:30.000 --> 03:33.000
Different races get different genetic diseases.

03:33.000 --> 03:37.000
This leads us to the very puzzling story of the sickle cell.

03:37.000 --> 03:43.000
Sickle cell anaemia is a genetic disorder found almost exclusively in Africa and South Asia.

03:43.000 --> 03:47.000
It wasn't confined to this area because Satan took a vacation there.

03:47.000 --> 03:53.000
The sickle cell is a genetic mutation to the haemoglobin gene and it's there for a very good reason.

03:53.000 --> 03:55.000
It's effective against malaria.

03:55.000 --> 03:58.000
It's perfectly consistent with the idea of evolution,

03:58.000 --> 04:02.000
because people with the mutation had some advantage in combating malaria.

04:02.000 --> 04:05.000
Of course it can cause anaemia in some carriers,

04:05.000 --> 04:11.000
but the evolutionary benefits of combating malaria outweigh the evolutionary disadvantages of anaemia.

04:11.000 --> 04:14.000
So the gene thrives and gets passed on.

04:14.000 --> 04:19.000
But if we go to the idea of intelligent design, the sickle cell makes no sense.

04:19.000 --> 04:25.000
For a start, why would God want to protect only some people in the world against malaria and not others?

04:25.000 --> 04:28.000
The natives of South America have no such protection.

04:29.000 --> 04:34.000
And why, if God is trying to protect Africans and people in South Asia with this gene,

04:34.000 --> 04:38.000
is the gene so defective that it has side effects?

04:38.000 --> 04:42.000
The fact is that the DNA replication system is far from perfect

04:42.000 --> 04:46.000
and sadly every baby that's born isn't a little miracle.

04:48.000 --> 04:52.000
Some of these genetic defects are very old and affect the entire human population.

04:52.000 --> 04:56.000
Others are more recent and affect races that share a genetic history.

04:56.000 --> 05:00.000
The oldest of the lot affect both humans and animals.

05:00.000 --> 05:06.000
The DNA molecule is very large, which means its replication is often messy and flawed.

05:06.000 --> 05:11.000
Every time DNA makes a copy of itself, some parts get miscopied.

05:11.000 --> 05:15.000
Most of the time the imperfect copy is barely more than a nuisance to the individual.

05:15.000 --> 05:20.000
A longer neck, a smaller nose, a bigger brain or a hairier body.

05:20.000 --> 05:25.000
These traits may even be useful, so over time more individuals will inherit them.

05:25.000 --> 05:30.000
But sometimes the bad copies produce gross abnormalities in animals as well as humans.

05:30.000 --> 05:33.000
There's one final twist in the tale.

05:33.000 --> 05:38.000
Recently the Human Genome Project mapped our DNA and located every active part of it.

05:38.000 --> 05:44.000
But in between the active genes, the ones that get switched on and hopefully produce a perfect human copy,

05:44.000 --> 05:47.000
there are thousands of inactive genes.

05:47.000 --> 05:52.000
These are redundant, a throwback to traits that our ancestors had that we no longer require,

05:52.000 --> 05:56.000
like a hairy body or a tail or a large number of nipples.

05:56.000 --> 06:01.000
Every now and again these genes get switched on, obviously by accident.

06:01.000 --> 06:03.000
This isn't intelligent design.

06:03.000 --> 06:07.000
There is of course overwhelming evidence that our genes are inherited,

06:07.000 --> 06:11.000
that mutations are hit and miss and the successful ones get passed on.

06:11.000 --> 06:13.000
That's how animals evolve.

06:13.000 --> 06:17.000
If all this is design, then it's a bad design.

06:17.000 --> 06:23.000
If it's deliberately a roll of the dice, then it has devastating consequences for some unlucky children.

06:23.000 --> 06:25.000
It's anything but intelligent.
