0	5000	When I was a kid I went to church and learned how God had made us all.
5000	8000	Later I learned how he did it and it was brilliant.
8000	10000	His design is called DNA.
10000	15000	A father's DNA combines with a mother's DNA to make a kind of blueprint.
15000	21000	This DNA replicates itself and ensures that the tiny fetus grows into a perfect baby,
21000	23000	just the way God intended.
23000	26000	We call this intelligent design.
26000	31000	The designer is a perfect being, which is why his design is so perfect.
31000	36000	Someone once told me, if you want proof of God, just look at your hand.
36000	39000	Well okay, not that hand.
39000	41000	Not that hand either.
41000	48000	But when I was younger I did take a look at hands and noticed that they're not all shining examples of the perfect work of God.
48000	52000	This is an example of polydactyly, which is a genetic abnormality.
52000	56000	It means the DNA copy has been badly executed.
56000	58000	And it's not just the hands.
58000	64000	The problem I later discovered is that when DNA replicates itself, it sometimes makes imperfect copies.
64000	67000	These cause deformities and diseases.
67000	72000	Sometimes they're apparent from birth, other times they manifest themselves later in life.
72000	77000	Now if God designed our replication system, there has to be an explanation.
78000	83000	No, we're not talking about diseases like typhoid, HIV or hepatitis.
83000	88000	These are diseases and abnormalities that result from God's own replication system.
88000	91000	A system He designed.
92000	97000	Which is a pretty strange thing for a loving God to want to do. Why?
98000	100000	No, that doesn't make any sense.
100000	106000	These genetic diseases and deformities strike Christians, Muslims, Hindus, Buddhists and atheists alike.
106000	111000	Christian Filipinos don't get tested any more than Muslim Filipinos.
113000	116000	Then why aren't all babies deformed?
116000	120000	Ten percent of five-year-old children have some form of congenital abnormality.
120000	122000	And that's a lot.
122000	127000	But if babies are sinners, why don't we all get these abnormalities and in equal measure?
127000	130000	Some abnormalities are worse than others.
131000	134000	But animals get exactly the same abnormalities too.
134000	138000	They don't have original sin. Why are they being punished?
142000	144000	Ah, maybe they will.
144000	150000	But that doesn't tell us why God has designed a replication system that's deliberately or even accidentally flawed.
150000	152000	What's the point?
152000	158000	It's very easy for us, living comfortable lives, to say it doesn't matter if these children suffer during their time on earth.
158000	163000	But it matters to Him and to her and them.
164000	168000	But God is supposed to be immeasurably wise, perfect and powerful.
168000	172000	We can treat some of these diseases and fix a lot of the deformities.
172000	176000	Spina bifida can be prevented with a simple dose of folic acid.
176000	181000	If babies with cleft palates get surgery early on, they grow up perfectly healthy and happy.
181000	185000	Why couldn't God just fix the problems right from the start?
185000	189000	Ah, yes. When all else fails, blame Satan.
189000	194000	But the devil would have to step in and physically change the chemical make-up of DNA,
194000	199000	not just once but millions of times, to create mutations that lead to genetic disorders.
199000	202000	How? That's an incredible feat.
202000	207000	And if God made a perfect system, how can something less powerful manage to change it?
207000	210000	But here's the real killer to this idea.
210000	213000	Different races get different genetic diseases.
213000	217000	This leads us to the very puzzling story of the sickle cell.
217000	223000	Sickle cell anaemia is a genetic disorder found almost exclusively in Africa and South Asia.
223000	227000	It wasn't confined to this area because Satan took a vacation there.
227000	233000	The sickle cell is a genetic mutation to the haemoglobin gene and it's there for a very good reason.
233000	235000	It's effective against malaria.
235000	238000	It's perfectly consistent with the idea of evolution,
238000	242000	because people with the mutation had some advantage in combating malaria.
242000	245000	Of course it can cause anaemia in some carriers,
245000	251000	but the evolutionary benefits of combating malaria outweigh the evolutionary disadvantages of anaemia.
251000	254000	So the gene thrives and gets passed on.
254000	259000	But if we go to the idea of intelligent design, the sickle cell makes no sense.
259000	265000	For a start, why would God want to protect only some people in the world against malaria and not others?
265000	268000	The natives of South America have no such protection.
269000	274000	And why, if God is trying to protect Africans and people in South Asia with this gene,
274000	278000	is the gene so defective that it has side effects?
278000	282000	The fact is that the DNA replication system is far from perfect
282000	286000	and sadly every baby that's born isn't a little miracle.
288000	292000	Some of these genetic defects are very old and affect the entire human population.
292000	296000	Others are more recent and affect races that share a genetic history.
296000	300000	The oldest of the lot affect both humans and animals.
300000	306000	The DNA molecule is very large, which means its replication is often messy and flawed.
306000	311000	Every time DNA makes a copy of itself, some parts get miscopied.
311000	315000	Most of the time the imperfect copy is barely more than a nuisance to the individual.
315000	320000	A longer neck, a smaller nose, a bigger brain or a hairier body.
320000	325000	These traits may even be useful, so over time more individuals will inherit them.
325000	330000	But sometimes the bad copies produce gross abnormalities in animals as well as humans.
330000	333000	There's one final twist in the tale.
333000	338000	Recently the Human Genome Project mapped our DNA and located every active part of it.
338000	344000	But in between the active genes, the ones that get switched on and hopefully produce a perfect human copy,
344000	347000	there are thousands of inactive genes.
347000	352000	These are redundant, a throwback to traits that our ancestors had that we no longer require,
352000	356000	like a hairy body or a tail or a large number of nipples.
356000	361000	Every now and again these genes get switched on, obviously by accident.
361000	363000	This isn't intelligent design.
363000	367000	There is of course overwhelming evidence that our genes are inherited,
367000	371000	that mutations are hit and miss and the successful ones get passed on.
371000	373000	That's how animals evolve.
373000	377000	If all this is design, then it's a bad design.
377000	383000	If it's deliberately a roll of the dice, then it has devastating consequences for some unlucky children.
383000	385000	It's anything but intelligent.
