00:00.000 --> 00:04.180
Popular creation speaker Eric Hovind and I were top contenders for an award on

00:04.300 --> 00:08.820
YouTube given out by, as Eric called them, the atheist, agnostic, anti-Christ,

00:08.940 --> 00:13.820
God-hating YouTubers. This award is given out to those creationists they deemed to

00:13.940 --> 00:18.380
have broken the 9th commandment. I find it highly ironic that they would call upon

00:18.500 --> 00:22.220
the laws of a God whom they contend does not even exist.

00:22.340 --> 00:26.220
Well, Eric Hovind apparently beat me up by a few votes, and YouTuber Potholer54,

00:26.280 --> 00:30.120
who organizes the awards, once again has criticized and accused out of his own

00:30.240 --> 00:31.200
sheer ignorance.

00:31.320 --> 00:36.160
Well Ian Juby's partly right. I'm ignorant about so many things, which is why I

00:36.280 --> 00:40.520
always try to bridge the gap of my ignorance by checking the claims made by

00:40.640 --> 00:45.720
nominees for the coveted Golden Crocoduck. So when Juby claimed two different nests

00:45.840 --> 00:50.920
of eggs were made by an oviraptor, I checked Juby's own source and found that

00:51.040 --> 00:55.880
he got it wrong. Which means his entire case that the oviraptor was running away

00:55.940 --> 01:00.300
from a flood is based on a breach of the 9th commandment, and that's what got him

01:00.420 --> 01:05.380
landed with a Golden Crocoduck nomination two years ago. And last year he got

01:05.500 --> 01:09.740
nominated for claiming that the Sun could have orbited the Earth, and then the two

01:09.860 --> 01:15.020
got out of balance and switched places. Once again, it's not my ignorance that

01:15.140 --> 01:19.780
tells me this is nonsense. It comes from checking the laws of planetary motion that

01:19.900 --> 01:25.700
have been established for 400 years, and that even most other creationists accept.

01:25.760 --> 01:29.360
As for why the award is given for the biggest breach of the 9th commandment,

01:29.480 --> 01:34.800
which atheists like me don't believe in, well that's easy. First, I do believe in

01:34.920 --> 01:39.640
not bearing false witness, unless telling the truth would needlessly hurt someone.

01:39.760 --> 01:44.120
I just don't need all the religious baggage that goes with it. Secondly, the

01:44.240 --> 01:47.680
Golden Crocoduck is awarded for the biggest breach of the 9th commandment in

01:47.800 --> 01:52.400
pursuit of the creationist cause, precisely because it is a creationist

01:52.460 --> 01:56.340
commandment. It wouldn't be much good giving creationists an award for

01:56.460 --> 02:01.140
breaching a Buddhist commandment, or an ancient Persian one, or even an atheist

02:01.260 --> 02:06.660
commandment, if we had any. So let's see who's guilty this year of breaching laws

02:06.780 --> 02:08.620
that they're supposed to follow.

02:08.740 --> 02:12.020
What do you have to do from an engineering point of view to change the

02:12.140 --> 02:13.260
cow into a whale?

02:22.400 --> 02:26.220
Biogenesis is the idea that life can form from non-living material, which is also

02:26.340 --> 02:29.940
called spontaneous generation, which was proven wrong over 200 years ago.

02:29.940 --> 02:54.460
Maybe the Vela Pulsar got wind somehow innately of Psalm 148, verse 3, and says,

02:54.580 --> 02:57.700
praise Him, Son of Moon, and all you shining stars. We're shining stars. We

02:57.740 --> 03:01.260
should praise Him. Well, how are we going to praise Him? I know. Let's oscillate

03:01.380 --> 03:06.700
11 times a second on our axis and see if we can send a radio signal into the

03:06.820 --> 03:14.020
universe that would join in the symphony of God's praise from all creation.

03:27.700 --> 03:34.700
Yeah, I'll tell you in a moment.

03:57.700 --> 04:11.700
If the earth is five billion years old, this dark mulch should be 10, 20, 30 feet

04:11.700 --> 04:12.700
thick.

04:41.700 --> 05:03.700
Yeheye, Yeheye, Yeheye, Yeheye, Yeheye, Yeheye, Yeheye, Yeheye, Yeheye, Yeheye, Yeheye, going

05:03.700 --> 05:17.700
Yeheye, Yeheye, Yeheye, Yeheye, Yeheye, Yeheye, going
