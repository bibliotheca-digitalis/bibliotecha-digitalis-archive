00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,180
Popular creation speaker Eric Hovind and I were top contenders for an award on

2
00:00:04,300 --> 00:00:08,820
YouTube given out by, as Eric called them, the atheist, agnostic, anti-Christ,

3
00:00:08,940 --> 00:00:13,820
God-hating YouTubers. This award is given out to those creationists they deemed to

4
00:00:13,940 --> 00:00:18,380
have broken the 9th commandment. I find it highly ironic that they would call upon

5
00:00:18,500 --> 00:00:22,220
the laws of a God whom they contend does not even exist.

6
00:00:22,340 --> 00:00:26,220
Well, Eric Hovind apparently beat me up by a few votes, and YouTuber Potholer54,

7
00:00:26,280 --> 00:00:30,120
who organizes the awards, once again has criticized and accused out of his own

8
00:00:30,240 --> 00:00:31,200
sheer ignorance.

9
00:00:31,320 --> 00:00:36,160
Well Ian Juby's partly right. I'm ignorant about so many things, which is why I

10
00:00:36,280 --> 00:00:40,520
always try to bridge the gap of my ignorance by checking the claims made by

11
00:00:40,640 --> 00:00:45,720
nominees for the coveted Golden Crocoduck. So when Juby claimed two different nests

12
00:00:45,840 --> 00:00:50,920
of eggs were made by an oviraptor, I checked Juby's own source and found that

13
00:00:51,040 --> 00:00:55,880
he got it wrong. Which means his entire case that the oviraptor was running away

14
00:00:55,940 --> 00:01:00,300
from a flood is based on a breach of the 9th commandment, and that's what got him

15
00:01:00,420 --> 00:01:05,380
landed with a Golden Crocoduck nomination two years ago. And last year he got

16
00:01:05,500 --> 00:01:09,740
nominated for claiming that the Sun could have orbited the Earth, and then the two

17
00:01:09,860 --> 00:01:15,020
got out of balance and switched places. Once again, it's not my ignorance that

18
00:01:15,140 --> 00:01:19,780
tells me this is nonsense. It comes from checking the laws of planetary motion that

19
00:01:19,900 --> 00:01:25,700
have been established for 400 years, and that even most other creationists accept.

20
00:01:25,760 --> 00:01:29,360
As for why the award is given for the biggest breach of the 9th commandment,

21
00:01:29,480 --> 00:01:34,800
which atheists like me don't believe in, well that's easy. First, I do believe in

22
00:01:34,920 --> 00:01:39,640
not bearing false witness, unless telling the truth would needlessly hurt someone.

23
00:01:39,760 --> 00:01:44,120
I just don't need all the religious baggage that goes with it. Secondly, the

24
00:01:44,240 --> 00:01:47,680
Golden Crocoduck is awarded for the biggest breach of the 9th commandment in

25
00:01:47,800 --> 00:01:52,400
pursuit of the creationist cause, precisely because it is a creationist

26
00:01:52,460 --> 00:01:56,340
commandment. It wouldn't be much good giving creationists an award for

27
00:01:56,460 --> 00:02:01,140
breaching a Buddhist commandment, or an ancient Persian one, or even an atheist

28
00:02:01,260 --> 00:02:06,660
commandment, if we had any. So let's see who's guilty this year of breaching laws

29
00:02:06,780 --> 00:02:08,620
that they're supposed to follow.

30
00:02:08,740 --> 00:02:12,020
What do you have to do from an engineering point of view to change the

31
00:02:12,140 --> 00:02:13,260
cow into a whale?

32
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:26,220
Biogenesis is the idea that life can form from non-living material, which is also

33
00:02:26,340 --> 00:02:29,940
called spontaneous generation, which was proven wrong over 200 years ago.

34
00:02:29,940 --> 00:02:54,460
Maybe the Vela Pulsar got wind somehow innately of Psalm 148, verse 3, and says,

35
00:02:54,580 --> 00:02:57,700
praise Him, Son of Moon, and all you shining stars. We're shining stars. We

36
00:02:57,740 --> 00:03:01,260
should praise Him. Well, how are we going to praise Him? I know. Let's oscillate

37
00:03:01,380 --> 00:03:06,700
11 times a second on our axis and see if we can send a radio signal into the

38
00:03:06,820 --> 00:03:14,020
universe that would join in the symphony of God's praise from all creation.

39
00:03:27,700 --> 00:03:34,700
Yeah, I'll tell you in a moment.

40
00:03:57,700 --> 00:04:11,700
If the earth is five billion years old, this dark mulch should be 10, 20, 30 feet

41
00:04:11,700 --> 00:04:12,700
thick.

42
00:04:41,700 --> 00:05:03,700
Yeheye, Yeheye, Yeheye, Yeheye, Yeheye, Yeheye, Yeheye, Yeheye, Yeheye, Yeheye, Yeheye, going

43
00:05:03,700 --> 00:05:17,700
Yeheye, Yeheye, Yeheye, Yeheye, Yeheye, Yeheye, going
