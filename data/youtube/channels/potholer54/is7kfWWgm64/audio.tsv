0	4180	Popular creation speaker Eric Hovind and I were top contenders for an award on
4300	8820	YouTube given out by, as Eric called them, the atheist, agnostic, anti-Christ,
8940	13820	God-hating YouTubers. This award is given out to those creationists they deemed to
13940	18380	have broken the 9th commandment. I find it highly ironic that they would call upon
18500	22220	the laws of a God whom they contend does not even exist.
22340	26220	Well, Eric Hovind apparently beat me up by a few votes, and YouTuber Potholer54,
26280	30120	who organizes the awards, once again has criticized and accused out of his own
30240	31200	sheer ignorance.
31320	36160	Well Ian Juby's partly right. I'm ignorant about so many things, which is why I
36280	40520	always try to bridge the gap of my ignorance by checking the claims made by
40640	45720	nominees for the coveted Golden Crocoduck. So when Juby claimed two different nests
45840	50920	of eggs were made by an oviraptor, I checked Juby's own source and found that
51040	55880	he got it wrong. Which means his entire case that the oviraptor was running away
55940	60300	from a flood is based on a breach of the 9th commandment, and that's what got him
60420	65380	landed with a Golden Crocoduck nomination two years ago. And last year he got
65500	69740	nominated for claiming that the Sun could have orbited the Earth, and then the two
69860	75020	got out of balance and switched places. Once again, it's not my ignorance that
75140	79780	tells me this is nonsense. It comes from checking the laws of planetary motion that
79900	85700	have been established for 400 years, and that even most other creationists accept.
85760	89360	As for why the award is given for the biggest breach of the 9th commandment,
89480	94800	which atheists like me don't believe in, well that's easy. First, I do believe in
94920	99640	not bearing false witness, unless telling the truth would needlessly hurt someone.
99760	104120	I just don't need all the religious baggage that goes with it. Secondly, the
104240	107680	Golden Crocoduck is awarded for the biggest breach of the 9th commandment in
107800	112400	pursuit of the creationist cause, precisely because it is a creationist
112460	116340	commandment. It wouldn't be much good giving creationists an award for
116460	121140	breaching a Buddhist commandment, or an ancient Persian one, or even an atheist
121260	126660	commandment, if we had any. So let's see who's guilty this year of breaching laws
126780	128620	that they're supposed to follow.
128740	132020	What do you have to do from an engineering point of view to change the
132140	133260	cow into a whale?
142400	146220	Biogenesis is the idea that life can form from non-living material, which is also
146340	149940	called spontaneous generation, which was proven wrong over 200 years ago.
149940	174460	Maybe the Vela Pulsar got wind somehow innately of Psalm 148, verse 3, and says,
174580	177700	praise Him, Son of Moon, and all you shining stars. We're shining stars. We
177740	181260	should praise Him. Well, how are we going to praise Him? I know. Let's oscillate
181380	186700	11 times a second on our axis and see if we can send a radio signal into the
186820	194020	universe that would join in the symphony of God's praise from all creation.
207700	214700	Yeah, I'll tell you in a moment.
237700	251700	If the earth is five billion years old, this dark mulch should be 10, 20, 30 feet
251700	252700	thick.
281700	303700	Yeheye, Yeheye, Yeheye, Yeheye, Yeheye, Yeheye, Yeheye, Yeheye, Yeheye, Yeheye, Yeheye, going
303700	317700	Yeheye, Yeheye, Yeheye, Yeheye, Yeheye, Yeheye, going
