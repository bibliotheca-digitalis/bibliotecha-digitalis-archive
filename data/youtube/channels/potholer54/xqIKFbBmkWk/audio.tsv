0	12420	These are some thoughts of mine on Pothole at 54's video, Human Ancestry Made Easy.
12420	19980	It is a video that, when subjected to logical analysis, seems to me to raise as many questions
19980	21260	as answers.
21260	25620	This video from Atacana was nominated by someone for a Golden Crocoduck.
25620	30420	Unfortunately it doesn't qualify, because Atacana doesn't breach the Ninth Commandment
30420	34960	here, he's just a bit confused about one of my videos and is asking a couple of questions
34960	36220	about it.
36220	40960	Well thanks for the sentiment Atacana, but I assure you I'm not losing my grip, not as
40960	45580	far as I know, but since this is such a popular question I'll be happy to explain it in a
45580	46660	video.
46660	51540	Maybe listeners with keen hearing will be able to spot the initial source of confusion.
51540	60220	According to Pothole at 54, the first female ancestor, common to all mankind, lived about
60220	69840	150,000 years ago.
69840	74860	My last video, Human Evolution Made Easy, showed how mitochondrial DNA can be used to
74860	79120	trace our most recent common matrilineal female ancestor.
79120	83040	The first female ancestor, common to all mankind.
83040	86680	Our most recent common matrilineal female ancestor.
86680	91920	Yes, you're all too sharp for me, Atacana is talking about the first female ancestor
91920	98080	common to all mankind, but I was talking about our most recent common matrilineal female
98080	100040	ancestor.
100040	105860	The first female ancestor common to all mankind would probably have been a fish, or some recognisably
105860	108800	female organism in the Cambrian.
108800	114520	Our most recent common matrilineal female ancestor was a woman who lived about 150,000
114520	115520	years ago.
115520	117120	Big difference.
117120	121640	The rest of Atacana's confused video is all based on this complete misunderstanding of
121640	125720	that crucial difference, but we'll have a listen anyway.
125720	135760	But in that case, why was the mother of this woman not also our common ancestor?
135760	141040	What was so different about the daughter that qualified her to be the mother of us
141040	147220	all, in contrast to her own mother?
147220	154840	And if she was indeed the mother of us all, then why was her own father not the father
154840	155840	of us all?
155840	157780	Well, of course he was.
157780	159240	So was her mother.
159240	163580	So were her grandparents, and great grandparents, and great great grandparents.
163580	169100	We have millions of common ancestors, but only one of them is our most recent common
169100	171780	matrilineal female ancestor.
171780	178340	Exactly what definition of being truly human is Pothola 54 using?
178340	181420	I say steady on.
181420	189180	The video then goes on to assert that the first male common ancestor lived about 60,000
189180	190180	years ago.
190180	195260	But the same can be done for markers on the Y chromosome, which are only passed from father
195260	196260	to son.
196260	200260	Again, I hope you can spot the difference between what I said and what Atacana thinks
200260	201260	I said.
201260	206700	He's talking again about a fish, our first common male ancestor, and I'm talking about
206700	211700	a man, our most recent common matrilineal male ancestor.
211700	216500	I gave an explanation of what matrilineal and patrilineal means in the video, which
216500	218980	Atacana probably missed.
218980	224540	And patrilineal ancestry through Y chromosome DNA gives much more accurate dates because
224540	226660	there's no mixing of genes.
226660	230900	So any mutations that occur have come about naturally, and since these happen with a fair
230900	235700	degree of regularity, our most recent common ancestors derived through this method can
235700	238060	be fairly accurately dated.
238060	241460	But Atacana brings up another point that's been put to me by others.
241460	247060	Why was our most recent common patrilineal ancestor much more recent than our most recent
247060	249620	common matrilineal ancestor?
249620	254940	Well, hang your heads in shame, guys, because it all comes down to the fact that men are
254940	258060	much more promiscuous than women.
258060	260160	Take Elvis Presley, for example.
260160	263660	He married Priscilla, and they had one daughter, Lisa Marie.
263660	267900	And if they'd had a couple of sons, all the Presley children could trace their matrilineal
267900	272860	and patrilineal ancestry back to the same contemporaneous couple.
272860	275180	But sadly, Elvis wasn't faithful.
275180	276420	He had a mistress.
276460	278580	Okay, maybe two mistresses.
278580	280300	Yes, all right.
280300	281820	No, that's enough.
281820	284600	Okay, okay, we've run out of space.
284600	288620	And some of the mistresses bore Elvis's illegitimate children.
288620	293100	And then those children got married and had children who would be Elvis's grandchildren.
293100	298100	Meanwhile, Lisa Marie married Michael Jackson, and they hadâ€¦
298100	301800	Okay, let's just stick with Elvis.
301800	307880	Now all the male children shared a most recent common patrilineal ancestor, Elvis Presley.
307880	312360	But Elvis's daughters and granddaughters need to go a lot further back to trace their most
312360	318540	recent common matrilineal ancestor, because they all had different mothers.
318540	323360	And since none, or maybe few, of the mothers were related, they could have had Polish,
323360	325460	Dutch, and Italian ancestry.
325460	330340	So a most recent common matrilineal ancestor could have been a Stone Age woman who migrated
330380	334260	across the Middle East tens of thousands of years ago.
334260	340100	So ladies, if you ever suspected that men are lion-cheating, fornicating scumbags, well,
340100	344980	you now have 150,000 years of genetic history to support your case.
344980	350340	Ah, you all say, but the most recent common female ancestor of all those Presley children
350340	352860	would surely be Elvis's mother.
352860	359300	Yes, but that's not a matrilineal ancestor, because it's not going through the female line.
359300	364360	As I said, the reason we use patrilineal and matrilineal ancestry is because it's easier
364360	365860	to date.
365860	369900	It's almost certain we have more recent male and female ancestors, it's just that they
369900	372540	can't be accurately dated.
372540	375480	If you didn't get the Elvis example, here's another one.
375480	377940	Take British comedian Ronnie Corbett.
377940	382080	He's happily married to actress Ann Hart and has two daughters, but if by chance he had
382080	387420	fathered a secret love child, then more people would be able to trace their ancestry to Ronnie
387420	388940	than to Ann.
388940	394980	Patakana's misunderstanding now leads him into a strange twilight zone of human history.
394980	401260	So where does this leave all the people in between the first supposed female ancestor
401260	406180	and the first supposed male ancestor?
406180	413340	If the first female common ancestor was in the past, but the first male common ancestor
413340	422940	was yet to come, then who or what exactly were the people in between?
422940	430100	Were they some kind of not quite human hybrid with the true yin of us, but not the true
430100	431100	yang?
431100	435300	Look, Patakana, our ancestors had yin and yang coming out the yin-yang.
435300	440460	They weren't deformed mutants, descended from a female ancestor and hopelessly confused
440460	443820	as they awaited the arrival of their male ancestor.
443820	448020	They were just as human as Priscilla Presley's parents and grandparents.
448020	453300	We're not related to every human who's ever lived, but that doesn't mean we're any less
453300	454300	human.
454300	458540	I obviously could have done a much better job of explaining all this, so I do take a
458540	463680	lot of the blame for the fact that Patakana, and others, found it confusing.
463680	467520	But if there's something you don't get, do go back over the video and check the wording
467520	471720	of what I said, because I usually say things for a certain reason.
471720	474480	And if something doesn't make sense, by all means, write and ask.
474480	478840	I'll be more than happy to explain it, or to point out a mistake and correct it if I'm
478840	479840	wrong.
479840	483680	Secondly, nothing in any of my videos is my theory.
483680	488520	Everything is based on research done by people with far greater expertise than me, and I
488520	490260	always cite the source.
490260	494860	So it's not my assertion that these male and female ancestors lived at these particular
494860	495860	times.
495860	499620	This is from Spencer Davis's research that I cited in the video.
499620	504320	Of course, if I've misquoted or misrepresented the source, then I do want to know about it,
504320	506980	so message me and I'll be happy to correct it.
