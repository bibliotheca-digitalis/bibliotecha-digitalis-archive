00:00.000 --> 00:12.420
These are some thoughts of mine on Pothole at 54's video, Human Ancestry Made Easy.

00:12.420 --> 00:19.980
It is a video that, when subjected to logical analysis, seems to me to raise as many questions

00:19.980 --> 00:21.260
as answers.

00:21.260 --> 00:25.620
This video from Atacana was nominated by someone for a Golden Crocoduck.

00:25.620 --> 00:30.420
Unfortunately it doesn't qualify, because Atacana doesn't breach the Ninth Commandment

00:30.420 --> 00:34.960
here, he's just a bit confused about one of my videos and is asking a couple of questions

00:34.960 --> 00:36.220
about it.

00:36.220 --> 00:40.960
Well thanks for the sentiment Atacana, but I assure you I'm not losing my grip, not as

00:40.960 --> 00:45.580
far as I know, but since this is such a popular question I'll be happy to explain it in a

00:45.580 --> 00:46.660
video.

00:46.660 --> 00:51.540
Maybe listeners with keen hearing will be able to spot the initial source of confusion.

00:51.540 --> 01:00.220
According to Pothole at 54, the first female ancestor, common to all mankind, lived about

01:00.220 --> 01:09.840
150,000 years ago.

01:09.840 --> 01:14.860
My last video, Human Evolution Made Easy, showed how mitochondrial DNA can be used to

01:14.860 --> 01:19.120
trace our most recent common matrilineal female ancestor.

01:19.120 --> 01:23.040
The first female ancestor, common to all mankind.

01:23.040 --> 01:26.680
Our most recent common matrilineal female ancestor.

01:26.680 --> 01:31.920
Yes, you're all too sharp for me, Atacana is talking about the first female ancestor

01:31.920 --> 01:38.080
common to all mankind, but I was talking about our most recent common matrilineal female

01:38.080 --> 01:40.040
ancestor.

01:40.040 --> 01:45.860
The first female ancestor common to all mankind would probably have been a fish, or some recognisably

01:45.860 --> 01:48.800
female organism in the Cambrian.

01:48.800 --> 01:54.520
Our most recent common matrilineal female ancestor was a woman who lived about 150,000

01:54.520 --> 01:55.520
years ago.

01:55.520 --> 01:57.120
Big difference.

01:57.120 --> 02:01.640
The rest of Atacana's confused video is all based on this complete misunderstanding of

02:01.640 --> 02:05.720
that crucial difference, but we'll have a listen anyway.

02:05.720 --> 02:15.760
But in that case, why was the mother of this woman not also our common ancestor?

02:15.760 --> 02:21.040
What was so different about the daughter that qualified her to be the mother of us

02:21.040 --> 02:27.220
all, in contrast to her own mother?

02:27.220 --> 02:34.840
And if she was indeed the mother of us all, then why was her own father not the father

02:34.840 --> 02:35.840
of us all?

02:35.840 --> 02:37.780
Well, of course he was.

02:37.780 --> 02:39.240
So was her mother.

02:39.240 --> 02:43.580
So were her grandparents, and great grandparents, and great great grandparents.

02:43.580 --> 02:49.100
We have millions of common ancestors, but only one of them is our most recent common

02:49.100 --> 02:51.780
matrilineal female ancestor.

02:51.780 --> 02:58.340
Exactly what definition of being truly human is Pothola 54 using?

02:58.340 --> 03:01.420
I say steady on.

03:01.420 --> 03:09.180
The video then goes on to assert that the first male common ancestor lived about 60,000

03:09.180 --> 03:10.180
years ago.

03:10.180 --> 03:15.260
But the same can be done for markers on the Y chromosome, which are only passed from father

03:15.260 --> 03:16.260
to son.

03:16.260 --> 03:20.260
Again, I hope you can spot the difference between what I said and what Atacana thinks

03:20.260 --> 03:21.260
I said.

03:21.260 --> 03:26.700
He's talking again about a fish, our first common male ancestor, and I'm talking about

03:26.700 --> 03:31.700
a man, our most recent common matrilineal male ancestor.

03:31.700 --> 03:36.500
I gave an explanation of what matrilineal and patrilineal means in the video, which

03:36.500 --> 03:38.980
Atacana probably missed.

03:38.980 --> 03:44.540
And patrilineal ancestry through Y chromosome DNA gives much more accurate dates because

03:44.540 --> 03:46.660
there's no mixing of genes.

03:46.660 --> 03:50.900
So any mutations that occur have come about naturally, and since these happen with a fair

03:50.900 --> 03:55.700
degree of regularity, our most recent common ancestors derived through this method can

03:55.700 --> 03:58.060
be fairly accurately dated.

03:58.060 --> 04:01.460
But Atacana brings up another point that's been put to me by others.

04:01.460 --> 04:07.060
Why was our most recent common patrilineal ancestor much more recent than our most recent

04:07.060 --> 04:09.620
common matrilineal ancestor?

04:09.620 --> 04:14.940
Well, hang your heads in shame, guys, because it all comes down to the fact that men are

04:14.940 --> 04:18.060
much more promiscuous than women.

04:18.060 --> 04:20.160
Take Elvis Presley, for example.

04:20.160 --> 04:23.660
He married Priscilla, and they had one daughter, Lisa Marie.

04:23.660 --> 04:27.900
And if they'd had a couple of sons, all the Presley children could trace their matrilineal

04:27.900 --> 04:32.860
and patrilineal ancestry back to the same contemporaneous couple.

04:32.860 --> 04:35.180
But sadly, Elvis wasn't faithful.

04:35.180 --> 04:36.420
He had a mistress.

04:36.460 --> 04:38.580
Okay, maybe two mistresses.

04:38.580 --> 04:40.300
Yes, all right.

04:40.300 --> 04:41.820
No, that's enough.

04:41.820 --> 04:44.600
Okay, okay, we've run out of space.

04:44.600 --> 04:48.620
And some of the mistresses bore Elvis's illegitimate children.

04:48.620 --> 04:53.100
And then those children got married and had children who would be Elvis's grandchildren.

04:53.100 --> 04:58.100
Meanwhile, Lisa Marie married Michael Jackson, and they hadâ€¦

04:58.100 --> 05:01.800
Okay, let's just stick with Elvis.

05:01.800 --> 05:07.880
Now all the male children shared a most recent common patrilineal ancestor, Elvis Presley.

05:07.880 --> 05:12.360
But Elvis's daughters and granddaughters need to go a lot further back to trace their most

05:12.360 --> 05:18.540
recent common matrilineal ancestor, because they all had different mothers.

05:18.540 --> 05:23.360
And since none, or maybe few, of the mothers were related, they could have had Polish,

05:23.360 --> 05:25.460
Dutch, and Italian ancestry.

05:25.460 --> 05:30.340
So a most recent common matrilineal ancestor could have been a Stone Age woman who migrated

05:30.380 --> 05:34.260
across the Middle East tens of thousands of years ago.

05:34.260 --> 05:40.100
So ladies, if you ever suspected that men are lion-cheating, fornicating scumbags, well,

05:40.100 --> 05:44.980
you now have 150,000 years of genetic history to support your case.

05:44.980 --> 05:50.340
Ah, you all say, but the most recent common female ancestor of all those Presley children

05:50.340 --> 05:52.860
would surely be Elvis's mother.

05:52.860 --> 05:59.300
Yes, but that's not a matrilineal ancestor, because it's not going through the female line.

05:59.300 --> 06:04.360
As I said, the reason we use patrilineal and matrilineal ancestry is because it's easier

06:04.360 --> 06:05.860
to date.

06:05.860 --> 06:09.900
It's almost certain we have more recent male and female ancestors, it's just that they

06:09.900 --> 06:12.540
can't be accurately dated.

06:12.540 --> 06:15.480
If you didn't get the Elvis example, here's another one.

06:15.480 --> 06:17.940
Take British comedian Ronnie Corbett.

06:17.940 --> 06:22.080
He's happily married to actress Ann Hart and has two daughters, but if by chance he had

06:22.080 --> 06:27.420
fathered a secret love child, then more people would be able to trace their ancestry to Ronnie

06:27.420 --> 06:28.940
than to Ann.

06:28.940 --> 06:34.980
Patakana's misunderstanding now leads him into a strange twilight zone of human history.

06:34.980 --> 06:41.260
So where does this leave all the people in between the first supposed female ancestor

06:41.260 --> 06:46.180
and the first supposed male ancestor?

06:46.180 --> 06:53.340
If the first female common ancestor was in the past, but the first male common ancestor

06:53.340 --> 07:02.940
was yet to come, then who or what exactly were the people in between?

07:02.940 --> 07:10.100
Were they some kind of not quite human hybrid with the true yin of us, but not the true

07:10.100 --> 07:11.100
yang?

07:11.100 --> 07:15.300
Look, Patakana, our ancestors had yin and yang coming out the yin-yang.

07:15.300 --> 07:20.460
They weren't deformed mutants, descended from a female ancestor and hopelessly confused

07:20.460 --> 07:23.820
as they awaited the arrival of their male ancestor.

07:23.820 --> 07:28.020
They were just as human as Priscilla Presley's parents and grandparents.

07:28.020 --> 07:33.300
We're not related to every human who's ever lived, but that doesn't mean we're any less

07:33.300 --> 07:34.300
human.

07:34.300 --> 07:38.540
I obviously could have done a much better job of explaining all this, so I do take a

07:38.540 --> 07:43.680
lot of the blame for the fact that Patakana, and others, found it confusing.

07:43.680 --> 07:47.520
But if there's something you don't get, do go back over the video and check the wording

07:47.520 --> 07:51.720
of what I said, because I usually say things for a certain reason.

07:51.720 --> 07:54.480
And if something doesn't make sense, by all means, write and ask.

07:54.480 --> 07:58.840
I'll be more than happy to explain it, or to point out a mistake and correct it if I'm

07:58.840 --> 07:59.840
wrong.

07:59.840 --> 08:03.680
Secondly, nothing in any of my videos is my theory.

08:03.680 --> 08:08.520
Everything is based on research done by people with far greater expertise than me, and I

08:08.520 --> 08:10.260
always cite the source.

08:10.260 --> 08:14.860
So it's not my assertion that these male and female ancestors lived at these particular

08:14.860 --> 08:15.860
times.

08:15.860 --> 08:19.620
This is from Spencer Davis's research that I cited in the video.

08:19.620 --> 08:24.320
Of course, if I've misquoted or misrepresented the source, then I do want to know about it,

08:24.320 --> 08:26.980
so message me and I'll be happy to correct it.
