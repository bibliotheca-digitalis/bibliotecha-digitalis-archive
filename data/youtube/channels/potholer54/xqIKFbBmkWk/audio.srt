1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:12,420
These are some thoughts of mine on Pothole at 54's video, Human Ancestry Made Easy.

2
00:00:12,420 --> 00:00:19,980
It is a video that, when subjected to logical analysis, seems to me to raise as many questions

3
00:00:19,980 --> 00:00:21,260
as answers.

4
00:00:21,260 --> 00:00:25,620
This video from Atacana was nominated by someone for a Golden Crocoduck.

5
00:00:25,620 --> 00:00:30,420
Unfortunately it doesn't qualify, because Atacana doesn't breach the Ninth Commandment

6
00:00:30,420 --> 00:00:34,960
here, he's just a bit confused about one of my videos and is asking a couple of questions

7
00:00:34,960 --> 00:00:36,220
about it.

8
00:00:36,220 --> 00:00:40,960
Well thanks for the sentiment Atacana, but I assure you I'm not losing my grip, not as

9
00:00:40,960 --> 00:00:45,580
far as I know, but since this is such a popular question I'll be happy to explain it in a

10
00:00:45,580 --> 00:00:46,660
video.

11
00:00:46,660 --> 00:00:51,540
Maybe listeners with keen hearing will be able to spot the initial source of confusion.

12
00:00:51,540 --> 00:01:00,220
According to Pothole at 54, the first female ancestor, common to all mankind, lived about

13
00:01:00,220 --> 00:01:09,840
150,000 years ago.

14
00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:14,860
My last video, Human Evolution Made Easy, showed how mitochondrial DNA can be used to

15
00:01:14,860 --> 00:01:19,120
trace our most recent common matrilineal female ancestor.

16
00:01:19,120 --> 00:01:23,040
The first female ancestor, common to all mankind.

17
00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:26,680
Our most recent common matrilineal female ancestor.

18
00:01:26,680 --> 00:01:31,920
Yes, you're all too sharp for me, Atacana is talking about the first female ancestor

19
00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:38,080
common to all mankind, but I was talking about our most recent common matrilineal female

20
00:01:38,080 --> 00:01:40,040
ancestor.

21
00:01:40,040 --> 00:01:45,860
The first female ancestor common to all mankind would probably have been a fish, or some recognisably

22
00:01:45,860 --> 00:01:48,800
female organism in the Cambrian.

23
00:01:48,800 --> 00:01:54,520
Our most recent common matrilineal female ancestor was a woman who lived about 150,000

24
00:01:54,520 --> 00:01:55,520
years ago.

25
00:01:55,520 --> 00:01:57,120
Big difference.

26
00:01:57,120 --> 00:02:01,640
The rest of Atacana's confused video is all based on this complete misunderstanding of

27
00:02:01,640 --> 00:02:05,720
that crucial difference, but we'll have a listen anyway.

28
00:02:05,720 --> 00:02:15,760
But in that case, why was the mother of this woman not also our common ancestor?

29
00:02:15,760 --> 00:02:21,040
What was so different about the daughter that qualified her to be the mother of us

30
00:02:21,040 --> 00:02:27,220
all, in contrast to her own mother?

31
00:02:27,220 --> 00:02:34,840
And if she was indeed the mother of us all, then why was her own father not the father

32
00:02:34,840 --> 00:02:35,840
of us all?

33
00:02:35,840 --> 00:02:37,780
Well, of course he was.

34
00:02:37,780 --> 00:02:39,240
So was her mother.

35
00:02:39,240 --> 00:02:43,580
So were her grandparents, and great grandparents, and great great grandparents.

36
00:02:43,580 --> 00:02:49,100
We have millions of common ancestors, but only one of them is our most recent common

37
00:02:49,100 --> 00:02:51,780
matrilineal female ancestor.

38
00:02:51,780 --> 00:02:58,340
Exactly what definition of being truly human is Pothola 54 using?

39
00:02:58,340 --> 00:03:01,420
I say steady on.

40
00:03:01,420 --> 00:03:09,180
The video then goes on to assert that the first male common ancestor lived about 60,000

41
00:03:09,180 --> 00:03:10,180
years ago.

42
00:03:10,180 --> 00:03:15,260
But the same can be done for markers on the Y chromosome, which are only passed from father

43
00:03:15,260 --> 00:03:16,260
to son.

44
00:03:16,260 --> 00:03:20,260
Again, I hope you can spot the difference between what I said and what Atacana thinks

45
00:03:20,260 --> 00:03:21,260
I said.

46
00:03:21,260 --> 00:03:26,700
He's talking again about a fish, our first common male ancestor, and I'm talking about

47
00:03:26,700 --> 00:03:31,700
a man, our most recent common matrilineal male ancestor.

48
00:03:31,700 --> 00:03:36,500
I gave an explanation of what matrilineal and patrilineal means in the video, which

49
00:03:36,500 --> 00:03:38,980
Atacana probably missed.

50
00:03:38,980 --> 00:03:44,540
And patrilineal ancestry through Y chromosome DNA gives much more accurate dates because

51
00:03:44,540 --> 00:03:46,660
there's no mixing of genes.

52
00:03:46,660 --> 00:03:50,900
So any mutations that occur have come about naturally, and since these happen with a fair

53
00:03:50,900 --> 00:03:55,700
degree of regularity, our most recent common ancestors derived through this method can

54
00:03:55,700 --> 00:03:58,060
be fairly accurately dated.

55
00:03:58,060 --> 00:04:01,460
But Atacana brings up another point that's been put to me by others.

56
00:04:01,460 --> 00:04:07,060
Why was our most recent common patrilineal ancestor much more recent than our most recent

57
00:04:07,060 --> 00:04:09,620
common matrilineal ancestor?

58
00:04:09,620 --> 00:04:14,940
Well, hang your heads in shame, guys, because it all comes down to the fact that men are

59
00:04:14,940 --> 00:04:18,060
much more promiscuous than women.

60
00:04:18,060 --> 00:04:20,160
Take Elvis Presley, for example.

61
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:23,660
He married Priscilla, and they had one daughter, Lisa Marie.

62
00:04:23,660 --> 00:04:27,900
And if they'd had a couple of sons, all the Presley children could trace their matrilineal

63
00:04:27,900 --> 00:04:32,860
and patrilineal ancestry back to the same contemporaneous couple.

64
00:04:32,860 --> 00:04:35,180
But sadly, Elvis wasn't faithful.

65
00:04:35,180 --> 00:04:36,420
He had a mistress.

66
00:04:36,460 --> 00:04:38,580
Okay, maybe two mistresses.

67
00:04:38,580 --> 00:04:40,300
Yes, all right.

68
00:04:40,300 --> 00:04:41,820
No, that's enough.

69
00:04:41,820 --> 00:04:44,600
Okay, okay, we've run out of space.

70
00:04:44,600 --> 00:04:48,620
And some of the mistresses bore Elvis's illegitimate children.

71
00:04:48,620 --> 00:04:53,100
And then those children got married and had children who would be Elvis's grandchildren.

72
00:04:53,100 --> 00:04:58,100
Meanwhile, Lisa Marie married Michael Jackson, and they hadâ€¦

73
00:04:58,100 --> 00:05:01,800
Okay, let's just stick with Elvis.

74
00:05:01,800 --> 00:05:07,880
Now all the male children shared a most recent common patrilineal ancestor, Elvis Presley.

75
00:05:07,880 --> 00:05:12,360
But Elvis's daughters and granddaughters need to go a lot further back to trace their most

76
00:05:12,360 --> 00:05:18,540
recent common matrilineal ancestor, because they all had different mothers.

77
00:05:18,540 --> 00:05:23,360
And since none, or maybe few, of the mothers were related, they could have had Polish,

78
00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:25,460
Dutch, and Italian ancestry.

79
00:05:25,460 --> 00:05:30,340
So a most recent common matrilineal ancestor could have been a Stone Age woman who migrated

80
00:05:30,380 --> 00:05:34,260
across the Middle East tens of thousands of years ago.

81
00:05:34,260 --> 00:05:40,100
So ladies, if you ever suspected that men are lion-cheating, fornicating scumbags, well,

82
00:05:40,100 --> 00:05:44,980
you now have 150,000 years of genetic history to support your case.

83
00:05:44,980 --> 00:05:50,340
Ah, you all say, but the most recent common female ancestor of all those Presley children

84
00:05:50,340 --> 00:05:52,860
would surely be Elvis's mother.

85
00:05:52,860 --> 00:05:59,300
Yes, but that's not a matrilineal ancestor, because it's not going through the female line.

86
00:05:59,300 --> 00:06:04,360
As I said, the reason we use patrilineal and matrilineal ancestry is because it's easier

87
00:06:04,360 --> 00:06:05,860
to date.

88
00:06:05,860 --> 00:06:09,900
It's almost certain we have more recent male and female ancestors, it's just that they

89
00:06:09,900 --> 00:06:12,540
can't be accurately dated.

90
00:06:12,540 --> 00:06:15,480
If you didn't get the Elvis example, here's another one.

91
00:06:15,480 --> 00:06:17,940
Take British comedian Ronnie Corbett.

92
00:06:17,940 --> 00:06:22,080
He's happily married to actress Ann Hart and has two daughters, but if by chance he had

93
00:06:22,080 --> 00:06:27,420
fathered a secret love child, then more people would be able to trace their ancestry to Ronnie

94
00:06:27,420 --> 00:06:28,940
than to Ann.

95
00:06:28,940 --> 00:06:34,980
Patakana's misunderstanding now leads him into a strange twilight zone of human history.

96
00:06:34,980 --> 00:06:41,260
So where does this leave all the people in between the first supposed female ancestor

97
00:06:41,260 --> 00:06:46,180
and the first supposed male ancestor?

98
00:06:46,180 --> 00:06:53,340
If the first female common ancestor was in the past, but the first male common ancestor

99
00:06:53,340 --> 00:07:02,940
was yet to come, then who or what exactly were the people in between?

100
00:07:02,940 --> 00:07:10,100
Were they some kind of not quite human hybrid with the true yin of us, but not the true

101
00:07:10,100 --> 00:07:11,100
yang?

102
00:07:11,100 --> 00:07:15,300
Look, Patakana, our ancestors had yin and yang coming out the yin-yang.

103
00:07:15,300 --> 00:07:20,460
They weren't deformed mutants, descended from a female ancestor and hopelessly confused

104
00:07:20,460 --> 00:07:23,820
as they awaited the arrival of their male ancestor.

105
00:07:23,820 --> 00:07:28,020
They were just as human as Priscilla Presley's parents and grandparents.

106
00:07:28,020 --> 00:07:33,300
We're not related to every human who's ever lived, but that doesn't mean we're any less

107
00:07:33,300 --> 00:07:34,300
human.

108
00:07:34,300 --> 00:07:38,540
I obviously could have done a much better job of explaining all this, so I do take a

109
00:07:38,540 --> 00:07:43,680
lot of the blame for the fact that Patakana, and others, found it confusing.

110
00:07:43,680 --> 00:07:47,520
But if there's something you don't get, do go back over the video and check the wording

111
00:07:47,520 --> 00:07:51,720
of what I said, because I usually say things for a certain reason.

112
00:07:51,720 --> 00:07:54,480
And if something doesn't make sense, by all means, write and ask.

113
00:07:54,480 --> 00:07:58,840
I'll be more than happy to explain it, or to point out a mistake and correct it if I'm

114
00:07:58,840 --> 00:07:59,840
wrong.

115
00:07:59,840 --> 00:08:03,680
Secondly, nothing in any of my videos is my theory.

116
00:08:03,680 --> 00:08:08,520
Everything is based on research done by people with far greater expertise than me, and I

117
00:08:08,520 --> 00:08:10,260
always cite the source.

118
00:08:10,260 --> 00:08:14,860
So it's not my assertion that these male and female ancestors lived at these particular

119
00:08:14,860 --> 00:08:15,860
times.

120
00:08:15,860 --> 00:08:19,620
This is from Spencer Davis's research that I cited in the video.

121
00:08:19,620 --> 00:08:24,320
Of course, if I've misquoted or misrepresented the source, then I do want to know about it,

122
00:08:24,320 --> 00:08:26,980
so message me and I'll be happy to correct it.
