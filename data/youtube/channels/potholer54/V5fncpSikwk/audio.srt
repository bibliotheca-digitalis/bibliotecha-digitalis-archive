00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,400
Thanks for your last response Tony. We're really making progress in our list of disputed issues bringing us down to just one

2
00:00:08,160 --> 00:00:12,440
Tony has now dropped his claim that methane is not a significant greenhouse gas

3
00:00:12,860 --> 00:00:19,280
After I gave facts and figures showing that it is and called on him to cite a single study that shows otherwise

4
00:00:20,160 --> 00:00:27,880
And he's dropped his claim that I blew over Al Gore's assertion about co2 correlation after I showed that I had criticized it

5
00:00:28,240 --> 00:00:36,120
In addition, he couldn't cite a single study by any of the many scientists. He claimed poked holes in a paper by Shakoon et al

6
00:00:36,800 --> 00:00:42,320
So the one issue he's still trying to defend is his claim that positive feedback can't contribute to

7
00:00:42,740 --> 00:00:47,120
Deglaciation and his belief that this would have led to runaway warming and boiling oceans

8
00:00:47,560 --> 00:00:53,160
Before I respond to that because it won't take long. Let me start with something a little more harmonious

9
00:00:53,400 --> 00:00:58,400
I'm delighted that Tony now agrees with the accepted definition of an argument from authority

10
00:00:59,040 --> 00:01:01,040
As I explained in my last video

11
00:01:01,040 --> 00:01:07,520
It doesn't refer to peer-reviewed studies because these are the building blocks of science an argument from authority

12
00:01:08,120 --> 00:01:15,000
Also known as an appeal to authority is claiming that just because a scientist or some other authority gives an opinion

13
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:17,000
It must therefore be true

14
00:01:17,640 --> 00:01:23,320
Tony now agrees the process of simply quoting expert opinion is an appeal to authority

15
00:01:23,320 --> 00:01:27,720
And I'm sure Tony would also agree that if quoting the opinion of an authority is bad

16
00:01:28,040 --> 00:01:34,300
Then quoting the opinion of someone who isn't an authority like me or Tony is even worse

17
00:01:34,840 --> 00:01:39,720
I've been saying the same thing in my videos for the last 12 years. Here are some clips

18
00:01:40,720 --> 00:01:48,560
Quoting what experts say in television interviews or blogs or even congressional inquiries is called an argument from authority

19
00:01:48,560 --> 00:01:53,420
What matters is not what these contrarians assert in blogs and TV interviews

20
00:01:53,600 --> 00:01:59,040
What matters is the evidence they publish in scientific papers supporting those assertions

21
00:01:59,480 --> 00:02:06,600
Simply listing names and appealing to authority let alone a phony authority is not how science is done

22
00:02:06,600 --> 00:02:12,200
This is why I never report something as science on the basis that a scientist says it is

23
00:02:12,640 --> 00:02:19,200
But people who watch Tony Heller's last video will sway blind that I must do because Tony said I did

24
00:02:19,600 --> 00:02:25,560
Journalists like pothole are left to make appeals to authority pothole are frequently points on his videos that

25
00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:32,960
Professional scientists said this or professional scientists said that I don't use the phrase professional scientists said

26
00:02:33,560 --> 00:02:41,120
Firstly because not all professional scientists are researchers and what matters is research because that's how science is done

27
00:02:42,200 --> 00:02:46,840
Secondly because it doesn't matter what scientists say as Tony and I both agree

28
00:02:47,240 --> 00:02:50,840
What matters is what's been published in peer-reviewed studies?

29
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:58,720
So I always quote these studies anytime you hear the words researchers say or the authors say in my videos

30
00:02:58,960 --> 00:03:02,680
It's always referring to what they say in a peer-reviewed study

31
00:03:03,680 --> 00:03:06,720
Tony doesn't show any video clips to support his claim

32
00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:13,520
Of course, but because we both have time to fact-check in this debate and cite our sources. I can

33
00:03:14,200 --> 00:03:17,640
So here's where I referenced researchers in my last video

34
00:03:17,640 --> 00:03:24,840
The authors measured oxygen isotopes in the air bubbles trapped in the ice the authors say exactly the same thing as the Indiana

35
00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:29,120
University website what may explain it say the authors from this new data

36
00:03:29,520 --> 00:03:33,560
Researchers have calculated that changed they show their figures they cite their sources

37
00:03:33,560 --> 00:03:36,760
But what they found is that even if as they explain in the study

38
00:03:36,920 --> 00:03:44,020
They're measuring finding video evidence like this is why a fact-checking format is crucial in any science debate

39
00:03:44,020 --> 00:03:46,020
And why Tony wants to end it

40
00:03:46,840 --> 00:03:53,240
Every time he makes a claim, however trivial. It's very easy to fact-check and show that he's got it wrong

41
00:03:54,160 --> 00:03:56,440
So to make Tony's claim accurate

42
00:03:56,440 --> 00:04:03,800
He should have said pot Ola frequently points on his videos that peer-reviewed studies said this or peer-reviewed studies said that

43
00:04:04,120 --> 00:04:08,560
And that would be correct because that is exactly how science is done

44
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,560
And that brings us to Tony's last remaining issue

45
00:04:12,960 --> 00:04:18,020
He's already said in two previous videos that because the role of positive feedback in

46
00:04:18,500 --> 00:04:24,720
Deglaciations doesn't make any sense to him. He doesn't accept it and his third video simply repeats that

47
00:04:24,980 --> 00:04:29,260
So now we're gonna look at the science of feedback and see why that doesn't make any sense

48
00:04:30,100 --> 00:04:32,200
We're all familiar with audio feedback

49
00:04:32,200 --> 00:04:36,180
Tony even gives the same example of audio feedback that I've already

50
00:04:36,500 --> 00:04:43,540
Explained is wrong with a gain of greater than one the sound is coming out of the speaker feeding back into the microphone getting louder

51
00:04:43,780 --> 00:04:47,400
It's going around this loop and gets louder and louder and louder

52
00:04:47,900 --> 00:04:49,900
But as I've explained twice now

53
00:04:49,940 --> 00:04:56,460
The earth has a mechanism for slowing down the rate of warming once the initial forcing stops as it gets warmer

54
00:04:56,460 --> 00:04:58,260
The earth radiates more heat

55
00:04:58,260 --> 00:05:04,600
So the amount of outgoing energy rises until it matches the amount of incoming energy and the temperature

56
00:05:04,920 --> 00:05:11,340
Stabilizes at the equilibrium temperature. There's no such mechanism in Tony's audio feedback example

57
00:05:11,340 --> 00:05:16,200
Which is why you get runaway feedback there, but not in the Earth's energy system

58
00:05:16,940 --> 00:05:22,580
Secondly as Tony himself admits the feedback of the audio system has a gain of greater than one

59
00:05:22,980 --> 00:05:24,980
That's not the case with the earth

60
00:05:25,180 --> 00:05:32,420
This is a crucial difference because as I explained once the initial forcing stops Earth's temperature feedback

61
00:05:32,500 --> 00:05:36,940
Dampens down over time that doesn't happen with audio feedback

62
00:05:37,460 --> 00:05:43,780
Thirdly in the case of glacial cycles changes in the earth's tilt and orbit work against runaway warming as

63
00:05:44,140 --> 00:05:50,180
I explained they eventually send the climate out of an interglacial and back into another glaciation

64
00:05:50,660 --> 00:05:53,920
No, such cycles exist that reverse audio feedback

65
00:05:54,400 --> 00:05:58,000
So now let's discuss the consequences of potholars theory

66
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:02,320
But as I've repeatedly shown I'm not explaining my theories here

67
00:06:02,380 --> 00:06:06,760
These are measurements and calculations published in peer-reviewed scientific papers

68
00:06:07,020 --> 00:06:09,460
Of course, Tony should know this by now

69
00:06:09,900 --> 00:06:14,460
Because I've said or my theory might so many times that some people want to make it a meme

70
00:06:14,660 --> 00:06:17,700
I've shown these papers and cited them in the video description

71
00:06:18,940 --> 00:06:22,500
Insisting that it's my theory is a great debating tactic

72
00:06:22,780 --> 00:06:28,160
Because of course it means Tony can avoid reading these studies and he doesn't feel he has to rebut them

73
00:06:28,500 --> 00:06:35,580
But after three videos trying to pretend that all I'm doing is cobbling together. My own theory is wearing a little thin

74
00:06:36,540 --> 00:06:42,440
The difference between my explanation and Tony's is that you don't have to take my word for any of this

75
00:06:42,660 --> 00:06:49,920
It's so well understood that it's been established physics for four decades and is laid out very clearly in papers that I've cited

76
00:06:50,540 --> 00:06:57,380
Tony doesn't suggest that I've misrepresented or misunderstood these studies and anyone is free to read them and check

77
00:06:57,940 --> 00:07:04,940
by contrast Tony hasn't provided anything except an appeal to his own authority or in this case a lack of

78
00:07:05,180 --> 00:07:06,300
authority

79
00:07:06,300 --> 00:07:10,780
The argument I hear from a lot of his subscribers is well Tony's got a geology degree

80
00:07:11,420 --> 00:07:16,780
Well, I've got a geology degree too. It doesn't make me an expert on the Earth's energy systems

81
00:07:17,300 --> 00:07:24,620
And even if both of us were experts in this we've already agreed that citing expert opinion is an appeal to authority

82
00:07:25,500 --> 00:07:30,820
This isn't an arts debate where we're debating our personal opinions. This is science

83
00:07:31,140 --> 00:07:36,780
Tony can't just decide that the Earth's feedback system is greater than the forcing because that's his opinion

84
00:07:36,820 --> 00:07:42,980
He has to show where this has been measured and calculated and he needs to cite scientific studies

85
00:07:42,980 --> 00:07:50,040
That support his belief that these feedbacks ought to lead to runaway warming and boiling oceans. I've asked twice now

86
00:07:50,580 --> 00:07:52,860
So I'm hoping third time lucky
