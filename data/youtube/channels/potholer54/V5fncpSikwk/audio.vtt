00:00.000 --> 00:07.400
Thanks for your last response Tony. We're really making progress in our list of disputed issues bringing us down to just one

00:08.160 --> 00:12.440
Tony has now dropped his claim that methane is not a significant greenhouse gas

00:12.860 --> 00:19.280
After I gave facts and figures showing that it is and called on him to cite a single study that shows otherwise

00:20.160 --> 00:27.880
And he's dropped his claim that I blew over Al Gore's assertion about co2 correlation after I showed that I had criticized it

00:28.240 --> 00:36.120
In addition, he couldn't cite a single study by any of the many scientists. He claimed poked holes in a paper by Shakoon et al

00:36.800 --> 00:42.320
So the one issue he's still trying to defend is his claim that positive feedback can't contribute to

00:42.740 --> 00:47.120
Deglaciation and his belief that this would have led to runaway warming and boiling oceans

00:47.560 --> 00:53.160
Before I respond to that because it won't take long. Let me start with something a little more harmonious

00:53.400 --> 00:58.400
I'm delighted that Tony now agrees with the accepted definition of an argument from authority

00:59.040 --> 01:01.040
As I explained in my last video

01:01.040 --> 01:07.520
It doesn't refer to peer-reviewed studies because these are the building blocks of science an argument from authority

01:08.120 --> 01:15.000
Also known as an appeal to authority is claiming that just because a scientist or some other authority gives an opinion

01:15.000 --> 01:17.000
It must therefore be true

01:17.640 --> 01:23.320
Tony now agrees the process of simply quoting expert opinion is an appeal to authority

01:23.320 --> 01:27.720
And I'm sure Tony would also agree that if quoting the opinion of an authority is bad

01:28.040 --> 01:34.300
Then quoting the opinion of someone who isn't an authority like me or Tony is even worse

01:34.840 --> 01:39.720
I've been saying the same thing in my videos for the last 12 years. Here are some clips

01:40.720 --> 01:48.560
Quoting what experts say in television interviews or blogs or even congressional inquiries is called an argument from authority

01:48.560 --> 01:53.420
What matters is not what these contrarians assert in blogs and TV interviews

01:53.600 --> 01:59.040
What matters is the evidence they publish in scientific papers supporting those assertions

01:59.480 --> 02:06.600
Simply listing names and appealing to authority let alone a phony authority is not how science is done

02:06.600 --> 02:12.200
This is why I never report something as science on the basis that a scientist says it is

02:12.640 --> 02:19.200
But people who watch Tony Heller's last video will sway blind that I must do because Tony said I did

02:19.600 --> 02:25.560
Journalists like pothole are left to make appeals to authority pothole are frequently points on his videos that

02:25.920 --> 02:32.960
Professional scientists said this or professional scientists said that I don't use the phrase professional scientists said

02:33.560 --> 02:41.120
Firstly because not all professional scientists are researchers and what matters is research because that's how science is done

02:42.200 --> 02:46.840
Secondly because it doesn't matter what scientists say as Tony and I both agree

02:47.240 --> 02:50.840
What matters is what's been published in peer-reviewed studies?

02:51.360 --> 02:58.720
So I always quote these studies anytime you hear the words researchers say or the authors say in my videos

02:58.960 --> 03:02.680
It's always referring to what they say in a peer-reviewed study

03:03.680 --> 03:06.720
Tony doesn't show any video clips to support his claim

03:06.720 --> 03:13.520
Of course, but because we both have time to fact-check in this debate and cite our sources. I can

03:14.200 --> 03:17.640
So here's where I referenced researchers in my last video

03:17.640 --> 03:24.840
The authors measured oxygen isotopes in the air bubbles trapped in the ice the authors say exactly the same thing as the Indiana

03:25.120 --> 03:29.120
University website what may explain it say the authors from this new data

03:29.520 --> 03:33.560
Researchers have calculated that changed they show their figures they cite their sources

03:33.560 --> 03:36.760
But what they found is that even if as they explain in the study

03:36.920 --> 03:44.020
They're measuring finding video evidence like this is why a fact-checking format is crucial in any science debate

03:44.020 --> 03:46.020
And why Tony wants to end it

03:46.840 --> 03:53.240
Every time he makes a claim, however trivial. It's very easy to fact-check and show that he's got it wrong

03:54.160 --> 03:56.440
So to make Tony's claim accurate

03:56.440 --> 04:03.800
He should have said pot Ola frequently points on his videos that peer-reviewed studies said this or peer-reviewed studies said that

04:04.120 --> 04:08.560
And that would be correct because that is exactly how science is done

04:10.000 --> 04:12.560
And that brings us to Tony's last remaining issue

04:12.960 --> 04:18.020
He's already said in two previous videos that because the role of positive feedback in

04:18.500 --> 04:24.720
Deglaciations doesn't make any sense to him. He doesn't accept it and his third video simply repeats that

04:24.980 --> 04:29.260
So now we're gonna look at the science of feedback and see why that doesn't make any sense

04:30.100 --> 04:32.200
We're all familiar with audio feedback

04:32.200 --> 04:36.180
Tony even gives the same example of audio feedback that I've already

04:36.500 --> 04:43.540
Explained is wrong with a gain of greater than one the sound is coming out of the speaker feeding back into the microphone getting louder

04:43.780 --> 04:47.400
It's going around this loop and gets louder and louder and louder

04:47.900 --> 04:49.900
But as I've explained twice now

04:49.940 --> 04:56.460
The earth has a mechanism for slowing down the rate of warming once the initial forcing stops as it gets warmer

04:56.460 --> 04:58.260
The earth radiates more heat

04:58.260 --> 05:04.600
So the amount of outgoing energy rises until it matches the amount of incoming energy and the temperature

05:04.920 --> 05:11.340
Stabilizes at the equilibrium temperature. There's no such mechanism in Tony's audio feedback example

05:11.340 --> 05:16.200
Which is why you get runaway feedback there, but not in the Earth's energy system

05:16.940 --> 05:22.580
Secondly as Tony himself admits the feedback of the audio system has a gain of greater than one

05:22.980 --> 05:24.980
That's not the case with the earth

05:25.180 --> 05:32.420
This is a crucial difference because as I explained once the initial forcing stops Earth's temperature feedback

05:32.500 --> 05:36.940
Dampens down over time that doesn't happen with audio feedback

05:37.460 --> 05:43.780
Thirdly in the case of glacial cycles changes in the earth's tilt and orbit work against runaway warming as

05:44.140 --> 05:50.180
I explained they eventually send the climate out of an interglacial and back into another glaciation

05:50.660 --> 05:53.920
No, such cycles exist that reverse audio feedback

05:54.400 --> 05:58.000
So now let's discuss the consequences of potholars theory

05:58.000 --> 06:02.320
But as I've repeatedly shown I'm not explaining my theories here

06:02.380 --> 06:06.760
These are measurements and calculations published in peer-reviewed scientific papers

06:07.020 --> 06:09.460
Of course, Tony should know this by now

06:09.900 --> 06:14.460
Because I've said or my theory might so many times that some people want to make it a meme

06:14.660 --> 06:17.700
I've shown these papers and cited them in the video description

06:18.940 --> 06:22.500
Insisting that it's my theory is a great debating tactic

06:22.780 --> 06:28.160
Because of course it means Tony can avoid reading these studies and he doesn't feel he has to rebut them

06:28.500 --> 06:35.580
But after three videos trying to pretend that all I'm doing is cobbling together. My own theory is wearing a little thin

06:36.540 --> 06:42.440
The difference between my explanation and Tony's is that you don't have to take my word for any of this

06:42.660 --> 06:49.920
It's so well understood that it's been established physics for four decades and is laid out very clearly in papers that I've cited

06:50.540 --> 06:57.380
Tony doesn't suggest that I've misrepresented or misunderstood these studies and anyone is free to read them and check

06:57.940 --> 07:04.940
by contrast Tony hasn't provided anything except an appeal to his own authority or in this case a lack of

07:05.180 --> 07:06.300
authority

07:06.300 --> 07:10.780
The argument I hear from a lot of his subscribers is well Tony's got a geology degree

07:11.420 --> 07:16.780
Well, I've got a geology degree too. It doesn't make me an expert on the Earth's energy systems

07:17.300 --> 07:24.620
And even if both of us were experts in this we've already agreed that citing expert opinion is an appeal to authority

07:25.500 --> 07:30.820
This isn't an arts debate where we're debating our personal opinions. This is science

07:31.140 --> 07:36.780
Tony can't just decide that the Earth's feedback system is greater than the forcing because that's his opinion

07:36.820 --> 07:42.980
He has to show where this has been measured and calculated and he needs to cite scientific studies

07:42.980 --> 07:50.040
That support his belief that these feedbacks ought to lead to runaway warming and boiling oceans. I've asked twice now

07:50.580 --> 07:52.860
So I'm hoping third time lucky
