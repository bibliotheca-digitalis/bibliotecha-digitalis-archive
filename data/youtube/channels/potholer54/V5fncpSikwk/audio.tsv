0	7400	Thanks for your last response Tony. We're really making progress in our list of disputed issues bringing us down to just one
8160	12440	Tony has now dropped his claim that methane is not a significant greenhouse gas
12860	19280	After I gave facts and figures showing that it is and called on him to cite a single study that shows otherwise
20160	27880	And he's dropped his claim that I blew over Al Gore's assertion about co2 correlation after I showed that I had criticized it
28240	36120	In addition, he couldn't cite a single study by any of the many scientists. He claimed poked holes in a paper by Shakoon et al
36800	42320	So the one issue he's still trying to defend is his claim that positive feedback can't contribute to
42740	47120	Deglaciation and his belief that this would have led to runaway warming and boiling oceans
47560	53160	Before I respond to that because it won't take long. Let me start with something a little more harmonious
53400	58400	I'm delighted that Tony now agrees with the accepted definition of an argument from authority
59040	61040	As I explained in my last video
61040	67520	It doesn't refer to peer-reviewed studies because these are the building blocks of science an argument from authority
68120	75000	Also known as an appeal to authority is claiming that just because a scientist or some other authority gives an opinion
75000	77000	It must therefore be true
77640	83320	Tony now agrees the process of simply quoting expert opinion is an appeal to authority
83320	87720	And I'm sure Tony would also agree that if quoting the opinion of an authority is bad
88040	94300	Then quoting the opinion of someone who isn't an authority like me or Tony is even worse
94840	99720	I've been saying the same thing in my videos for the last 12 years. Here are some clips
100720	108560	Quoting what experts say in television interviews or blogs or even congressional inquiries is called an argument from authority
108560	113420	What matters is not what these contrarians assert in blogs and TV interviews
113600	119040	What matters is the evidence they publish in scientific papers supporting those assertions
119480	126600	Simply listing names and appealing to authority let alone a phony authority is not how science is done
126600	132200	This is why I never report something as science on the basis that a scientist says it is
132640	139200	But people who watch Tony Heller's last video will sway blind that I must do because Tony said I did
139600	145560	Journalists like pothole are left to make appeals to authority pothole are frequently points on his videos that
145920	152960	Professional scientists said this or professional scientists said that I don't use the phrase professional scientists said
153560	161120	Firstly because not all professional scientists are researchers and what matters is research because that's how science is done
162200	166840	Secondly because it doesn't matter what scientists say as Tony and I both agree
167240	170840	What matters is what's been published in peer-reviewed studies?
171360	178720	So I always quote these studies anytime you hear the words researchers say or the authors say in my videos
178960	182680	It's always referring to what they say in a peer-reviewed study
183680	186720	Tony doesn't show any video clips to support his claim
186720	193520	Of course, but because we both have time to fact-check in this debate and cite our sources. I can
194200	197640	So here's where I referenced researchers in my last video
197640	204840	The authors measured oxygen isotopes in the air bubbles trapped in the ice the authors say exactly the same thing as the Indiana
205120	209120	University website what may explain it say the authors from this new data
209520	213560	Researchers have calculated that changed they show their figures they cite their sources
213560	216760	But what they found is that even if as they explain in the study
216920	224020	They're measuring finding video evidence like this is why a fact-checking format is crucial in any science debate
224020	226020	And why Tony wants to end it
226840	233240	Every time he makes a claim, however trivial. It's very easy to fact-check and show that he's got it wrong
234160	236440	So to make Tony's claim accurate
236440	243800	He should have said pot Ola frequently points on his videos that peer-reviewed studies said this or peer-reviewed studies said that
244120	248560	And that would be correct because that is exactly how science is done
250000	252560	And that brings us to Tony's last remaining issue
252960	258020	He's already said in two previous videos that because the role of positive feedback in
258500	264720	Deglaciations doesn't make any sense to him. He doesn't accept it and his third video simply repeats that
264980	269260	So now we're gonna look at the science of feedback and see why that doesn't make any sense
270100	272200	We're all familiar with audio feedback
272200	276180	Tony even gives the same example of audio feedback that I've already
276500	283540	Explained is wrong with a gain of greater than one the sound is coming out of the speaker feeding back into the microphone getting louder
283780	287400	It's going around this loop and gets louder and louder and louder
287900	289900	But as I've explained twice now
289940	296460	The earth has a mechanism for slowing down the rate of warming once the initial forcing stops as it gets warmer
296460	298260	The earth radiates more heat
298260	304600	So the amount of outgoing energy rises until it matches the amount of incoming energy and the temperature
304920	311340	Stabilizes at the equilibrium temperature. There's no such mechanism in Tony's audio feedback example
311340	316200	Which is why you get runaway feedback there, but not in the Earth's energy system
316940	322580	Secondly as Tony himself admits the feedback of the audio system has a gain of greater than one
322980	324980	That's not the case with the earth
325180	332420	This is a crucial difference because as I explained once the initial forcing stops Earth's temperature feedback
332500	336940	Dampens down over time that doesn't happen with audio feedback
337460	343780	Thirdly in the case of glacial cycles changes in the earth's tilt and orbit work against runaway warming as
344140	350180	I explained they eventually send the climate out of an interglacial and back into another glaciation
350660	353920	No, such cycles exist that reverse audio feedback
354400	358000	So now let's discuss the consequences of potholars theory
358000	362320	But as I've repeatedly shown I'm not explaining my theories here
362380	366760	These are measurements and calculations published in peer-reviewed scientific papers
367020	369460	Of course, Tony should know this by now
369900	374460	Because I've said or my theory might so many times that some people want to make it a meme
374660	377700	I've shown these papers and cited them in the video description
378940	382500	Insisting that it's my theory is a great debating tactic
382780	388160	Because of course it means Tony can avoid reading these studies and he doesn't feel he has to rebut them
388500	395580	But after three videos trying to pretend that all I'm doing is cobbling together. My own theory is wearing a little thin
396540	402440	The difference between my explanation and Tony's is that you don't have to take my word for any of this
402660	409920	It's so well understood that it's been established physics for four decades and is laid out very clearly in papers that I've cited
410540	417380	Tony doesn't suggest that I've misrepresented or misunderstood these studies and anyone is free to read them and check
417940	424940	by contrast Tony hasn't provided anything except an appeal to his own authority or in this case a lack of
425180	426300	authority
426300	430780	The argument I hear from a lot of his subscribers is well Tony's got a geology degree
431420	436780	Well, I've got a geology degree too. It doesn't make me an expert on the Earth's energy systems
437300	444620	And even if both of us were experts in this we've already agreed that citing expert opinion is an appeal to authority
445500	450820	This isn't an arts debate where we're debating our personal opinions. This is science
451140	456780	Tony can't just decide that the Earth's feedback system is greater than the forcing because that's his opinion
456820	462980	He has to show where this has been measured and calculated and he needs to cite scientific studies
462980	470040	That support his belief that these feedbacks ought to lead to runaway warming and boiling oceans. I've asked twice now
470580	472860	So I'm hoping third time lucky
