0	7000	In part one of this two-part video I looked at PragerU's evidence that God and science are fully compatible,
7000	16000	which was based on two premises, that life is up against impossible odds and that the existence of the universe is up against impossible odds,
16000	22000	which as we saw could only be supported by changing figures and faking quotes.
22000	29000	At the end of the video we met the late Frank Pastore, who's going to give us arguments for what he calls God in part two.
29000	36000	There are really four big bangs that have to be accounted for, not just one. I'd never really even considered that before.
36000	47000	I've never even heard of it. After all, the big bang is a term coined by Fred Hoyle to describe what we now know was the creation of space, time and matter from singularity.
47000	51000	I can't find any reference in the scientific literature to three other big bangs.
51000	56000	Since Pastore made them up, I'll let him tell us what he thinks they are.
56000	63000	The first one we already know about. That's science. So let's start with what Pastore calls big bang number two.
63000	73000	So how do you get life from non-life? How did abiogenesis occur? I mean the notion that something can come from nothing.
73000	82000	Where's the evidence? Well, you're going to need another something from nothing leap of faith, some kind of biological second big bang.
83000	88000	Wait a minute. Blink and you might have missed that subtle change of claim. Let's rewind.
89000	96000	How did abiogenesis occur? I mean the notion that something can come from nothing. Where's the evidence?
96000	106000	Well, the short answer is there's no evidence. None. That's why no one, except religious believers, is suggesting that life came from nothing.
106000	114000	As the Latin translation of the word suggests, and Pastore told us initially, abiogenesis is life coming from non-life.
114000	125000	Frank Pastore is doing something Eric Metaxas did in the first video with life and intelligent life subtly changing the wording and making the two terms interchangeable.
125000	134000	Non-life, which is what biologists say life must have come from, means simple chemicals like hydrogen cyanide, ammonia and methane.
134000	141000	These must have combined to form nucleotides, the building blocks of DNA. In other words, a chemical process.
141000	148000	Nothing, which is what Frank is at times trying to get us to believe biologists say life came from, means nothing.
148000	158000	So researchers don't say that life came from nothing any more than researchers say the big bang came from nothing, which was a similar claim Pastore made in part one.
159000	167000	For all the mind-blowing advancements we've made in physics, biology and chemistry in just the past hundred years, we're still no closer to making it happen.
167000	168000	We don't have a clue.
168000	173000	Actually, we're not only closer to making it happen, we've already made it happen.
173000	184000	In March 2016, researchers at the Craig Venter Institute did create life from scratch, a synthetic cell. It's an entirely man-made genome.
184000	198000	I mean, sure, we've learned a lot about how to manipulate life forms, how to add and subtract DNA material, even map the human genome, but we have no idea how to literally create life from dead stuff.
198000	203000	That's true, but scientists aren't claiming that life came from dead cells.
203000	210000	Venter didn't make life from dead cells and he didn't make it from nothing because that wasn't how life on our planet would have begun.
210000	219000	Venter made a living cell through chemical reactions using simple chemicals and this isn't just a manipulation or copying of existing DNA.
219000	224000	As I said, the Venter Institute made a completely new genome from scratch.
224000	234000	Another laboratory, the Scripps Institute, made even simpler self-replicating enzymes in 2009 and even watched them evolve generation after generation.
234000	240000	Now, you can try to argue that this proves that life has to be created, just as the Bible says.
240000	249000	And I could argue back that all it shows is that we can replicate something that happens in nature, just as we can replicate lightning strikes and atomic fusion.
249000	257000	But I won't get into that argument because PragerU isn't getting into that argument. It's claiming this.
257000	261000	We're still no closer to making it happen. We don't have a clue.
261000	266000	The reality is that we were so close that it did happen. Next comes this.
266000	275000	We still don't have a way to account for the great diversity of life forms. I mean the huge differences between bacteria, plants and animals.
275000	284000	What? Scientists account for the diversity of life forms through a principle discovered by Darwin and Wallace called natural selection.
284000	288000	Outside of PragerU, this has taught to school children all over the world.
288000	295000	Nor do we have a way to account for the differences between man and animal. We still won't have an anthropology at this point.
295000	303000	Well, that's news to thousands of anthropologists who've been collecting fossil hominid skeletons for over 100 years. But OK, go on.
303000	308000	So we're going to need a kind of anthropological third big bang to account for all this.
308000	314000	Why? We already have a wealth of fossil evidence and DNA evidence showing that we evolved.
314000	324000	Hominid fossils change over time from characteristics that are more like ancestral apes gradually to characteristics that are increasingly more human.
324000	333000	As they progress, their brains clearly get bigger. There are obvious signs of bipedal motion, tool use and vocalisation.
333000	340000	So this wasn't a big bang. It was a slow evolutionary process that took about five to seven million years.
340000	351000	Why would we need to discard this in favour of a belief that we all popped into existence in some sort of magical big bang, which has no evidence to support it?
351000	361000	A final big bang is going to be required to explain how a mechanistic animal brain can become a self-reflective human mind.
361000	369000	Well, as we've seen, the answer is natural selection. You don't need a big bang for this, just billions of years of evolution.
369000	373000	And again, we can see the development of the brain in the fossil record.
373000	377000	Come on, animals don't do art and they don't appreciate beauty.
377000	383000	Well, the obvious answer to that is, how do you know? In fact, animals do do art.
383000	389000	They spend a lot of time and effort doing it and there's nothing to suggest that they don't appreciate it.
389000	393000	Or music.
393000	398000	How do we know what's going on inside their heads?
398000	407000	How do you account for free will and introspection, let alone man's pressing existential drive to ask why?
407000	418000	Well, we're going to need some kind of psychological fourth big bang to account for man's moral and aesthetic sense in his search for meaning, significance, and purpose.
418000	423000	And of course, his appreciation for the true, the good, and the beautiful.
423000	430000	Note, once again, you don't need a brain magically popping out of nowhere. You just need millions of years of evolution.
430000	438000	There's no mystery here. Mammalian brains have been getting bigger and more intelligent since mammals first crawled out of their burrows.
438000	445000	The fossil evidence shows that the further along the evolutionary path you go to larger and more developed brain power,
445000	450000	the more introspective animals become and the more free will they exhibit.
450000	455000	Elephants go back to places where their ancestors died, just as we do.
455000	464000	Dolphins can recognise their images in a mirror and experiments have shown that if you paint something on their faces, they'll go to the mirror to check it out.
464000	471000	And since they clearly exhibit introspection and awareness of self, maybe they are asking why. Who knows?
471000	481000	These problems require bangs. I mean, sudden binary pops into existence since there's no evidence for any gradual development in any of these.
481000	490000	And again, PragerU's presenters can try to argue that the evidence has been misinterpreted or that it's been faked or flawed or whatever.
490000	499000	But if that's too challenging, then they can't simply close their eyes and shut their ears and tell students that the evidence doesn't exist.
499000	507000	That's not only not how universities work, it's a breach of the ninth commandment that this university is endorsing.
507000	515000	So, next time someone asks you, hey, what about the big bang? Make sure you ask them, which one?
515000	521000	The cosmological, biological, anthropological or psychological?
521000	527000	And if anyone ever asks you that, you know what to say. Oh, you must have been watching a PragerU YouTube video.
527000	533000	In fact, there was only one big bang. All the other processes took millions of years.
533000	539000	And if they say, but PragerU told me there's no evidence for any gradual development in any of these,
539000	545000	then you can show them the wealth of DNA and fossil evidence that's been published in the last 150 years
545000	550000	and suggest that maybe PragerU knew it would be so hard to refute this evidence,
550000	556000	they found it easier and more expedient to tell students it simply didn't exist.
556000	559000	These are ideas students almost never hear.
559000	562000	That's right, because it's not science.
562000	569000	The idea that we should start teaching university students that everything popped into existence in four instant big bangs,
569000	575000	which science can't explain, is the day we stop teaching science and start making up stories.
575000	584000	Worse still, telling students that there's no evidence and not allowing them to even see the scientific discoveries of the last 150 years,
584000	588000	that's the opposite of what education is supposed to do.
588000	597000	A lot of people have written to say that PragerUs other videos on politics, economics, philosophy and theology are very good, which is fine.
597000	600000	I just don't happen to cover those subjects.
600000	607000	The purpose of this channel, as I say in my channel description, is to challenge junk science being spread around the internet.
607000	612000	So PragerU's opinions on politics or religion don't matter here.
612000	617000	What matters are its misrepresentations of scientific facts.
617000	622000	So to all those who like PragerU because of its political views, that's fine with me.
622000	625000	I respect everyone's right to an opinion.
625000	632000	But that doesn't mean you're obliged to buy the whole package and support its misrepresentation of science.
632000	639000	That's true whether you're on the right or the left of politics, as we've seen in the many videos I've produced on this channel.
639000	644000	Both left and right are equally capable of promoting scientific garbage.
644000	648000	We all need to be willing to say that's not acceptable.
