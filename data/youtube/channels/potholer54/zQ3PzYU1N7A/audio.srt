1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,520
In the first video of this series I looked at Al Gore's suggestion that this graph,

2
00:00:04,520 --> 00:00:09,080
which comes from the Vostok ice core, shows carbon dioxide and temperature in lock step

3
00:00:09,080 --> 00:00:11,960
over the last 400,000 years.

4
00:00:11,960 --> 00:00:16,200
Just to recap I'll let the film The Great Global Warming Swindle counter that one.

5
00:00:16,200 --> 00:00:21,760
So here we're looking at the ice core record from Vostok and in the red we see temperature

6
00:00:21,760 --> 00:00:27,080
going up from early time to later time at a very key interval when we came out of a

7
00:00:27,080 --> 00:00:34,240
glaciation and we see the temperature going up and then we see the CO2 coming up.

8
00:00:34,240 --> 00:00:41,520
CO2 lags behind that increase, it's got an 800 year lag so temperature is leading CO2

9
00:00:41,520 --> 00:00:44,000
by 800 years.

10
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:48,680
There have now been several major ice core surveys, every one of them shows the same

11
00:00:48,680 --> 00:00:49,880
thing.

12
00:00:49,880 --> 00:00:56,680
The temperature rises or falls and then after a few hundred years carbon dioxide follows.

13
00:00:56,680 --> 00:01:03,320
So obviously carbon dioxide is not the cause of that warming, in fact we can say that the

14
00:01:03,320 --> 00:01:06,880
warming produced the increase in carbon dioxide.

15
00:01:06,880 --> 00:01:11,920
And that's absolutely right, researchers say carbon dioxide was not the cause of the initial

16
00:01:11,920 --> 00:01:15,180
warming during any of the recent deglaciations.

17
00:01:15,180 --> 00:01:20,020
The most likely trigger was the Milankovitch cycles, changes in the Earth's tilt and orbit

18
00:01:20,020 --> 00:01:22,720
that caused more insulation.

19
00:01:22,760 --> 00:01:26,960
In climatology, something that triggers higher temperatures is called a forcing.

20
00:01:26,960 --> 00:01:33,240
So greater insulation due to the Earth's orbit is called orbital forcing or insulation forcing.

21
00:01:33,240 --> 00:01:37,360
The problem is this explanation has given rise to yet another myth that I'm going to

22
00:01:37,360 --> 00:01:39,620
deal with in this video.

23
00:01:39,620 --> 00:01:42,800
But first, a quick recap of myth number one.

24
00:01:42,800 --> 00:01:46,960
CO2 clearly cannot be causing temperature changes.

25
00:01:46,960 --> 00:01:50,760
It's a product of temperature, it's following temperature changes.

26
00:01:50,800 --> 00:01:54,920
Just because an increase in temperature puts more carbon dioxide into the atmosphere, which

27
00:01:54,920 --> 00:02:00,400
is true, that doesn't preclude carbon dioxide also causing temperatures to rise.

28
00:02:00,400 --> 00:02:04,760
Similarly, just because insulation causes temperature rises, that doesn't mean carbon

29
00:02:04,760 --> 00:02:07,540
dioxide can't cause temperatures to rise.

30
00:02:07,540 --> 00:02:12,200
Otherwise you could say that because kinetic energy can produce heat, then it must mean

31
00:02:12,200 --> 00:02:15,320
that heat can't produce kinetic energy.

32
00:02:15,320 --> 00:02:19,800
So let's go back to that graph which Durkin attributes to Kion et al.

33
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:24,640
He's probably referring to this famous 2003 paper in the journal Science, which is where

34
00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:27,280
that 800 year lag comes from.

35
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:31,600
By the way, Kion says there's a margin of error of 200 years.

36
00:02:31,600 --> 00:02:36,220
Kion was looking at the end of one of several glaciations during the ice age, this one called

37
00:02:36,220 --> 00:02:38,040
Termination 3.

38
00:02:38,040 --> 00:02:42,720
It marks the end of a glaciation about 240,000 years ago.

39
00:02:42,720 --> 00:02:47,260
Durkin's correct in saying there's an 800 year lag, but he didn't tell his audience

40
00:02:47,620 --> 00:02:50,440
what was in the rest of Kion's paper.

41
00:02:50,440 --> 00:02:55,820
The data for the graph – here's the real one by Kion et al – comes from an ice core

42
00:02:55,820 --> 00:02:58,860
at the Vostok station in Antarctica.

43
00:02:58,860 --> 00:03:03,820
Since the 1980s, ice cores have been getting progressively deeper, and the 800 year lag

44
00:03:03,820 --> 00:03:09,300
everyone now talks about comes from a core that was first analysed in 1999.

45
00:03:09,300 --> 00:03:14,620
So Vostok doesn't record global temperatures, it records Antarctic temperatures.

46
00:03:14,620 --> 00:03:19,820
And although temperature did indeed lead CO2 in Antarctica, Kion concluded that temperature

47
00:03:19,820 --> 00:03:24,900
rises lagged CO2 in the northern hemisphere, and he said so in his paper.

48
00:03:24,900 --> 00:03:30,500
A more recent paper by Shakun et al shows how much temperature leads CO2 in the southern

49
00:03:30,500 --> 00:03:34,700
hemisphere, and how much it lags in the northern hemisphere.

50
00:03:34,700 --> 00:03:39,540
The rise of CO2 level and the warming effect that produces is not only consistent with

51
00:03:39,540 --> 00:03:44,340
observation, it also explains something that's otherwise inexplicable.

52
00:03:44,340 --> 00:03:50,620
A paper by Lorius et al shows that insulation has varied by only 0.7 watts per square metre

53
00:03:50,620 --> 00:03:53,580
over the last 160,000 years.

54
00:03:53,580 --> 00:03:57,620
In other words, the tiny amount of forcing due to the Earth's orbit wasn't enough

55
00:03:57,620 --> 00:04:02,100
to defrost miles of thick ice covering a large part of the planet.

56
00:04:02,100 --> 00:04:07,140
It was the amplification of this initial warming by other factors – mostly greenhouse gases

57
00:04:07,140 --> 00:04:12,020
– that gives us the complete picture, which goes like this.

58
00:04:12,020 --> 00:04:17,260
The initial warming at the end of each glaciation was probably caused by orbital forcing.

59
00:04:17,260 --> 00:04:22,020
Carbon dioxide in the atmosphere played little or no part in this initial warming, and because

60
00:04:22,020 --> 00:04:28,060
CO2 is more soluble in colder water, a lot of it was dissolved in the deep oceans.

61
00:04:28,060 --> 00:04:33,720
But the higher temperatures caused by orbital forcing led to stronger winds and warmer water.

62
00:04:33,720 --> 00:04:38,420
Over several hundred years, that caused CO2 to circulate up from the ocean depths and

63
00:04:38,420 --> 00:04:41,180
eventually degas at the surface.

64
00:04:41,180 --> 00:04:45,940
As CO2 levels in the atmosphere rose, over the next few thousand years the greenhouse

65
00:04:45,940 --> 00:04:52,420
effect gradually took over from orbital forcing to become the predominant cause of warming.

66
00:04:52,420 --> 00:04:57,180
This amplification of the initial warming is a process known as positive feedback, which

67
00:04:57,180 --> 00:05:00,640
I explained in the first video of this series.

68
00:05:00,640 --> 00:05:06,140
Then as the Earth continues its wobble and erratic orbit, less insulation begins to fall

69
00:05:06,140 --> 00:05:11,820
and that triggers lower temperatures, causes more atmospheric CO2 to dissolve in the oceans,

70
00:05:11,820 --> 00:05:13,740
and the process goes into reverse.

71
00:05:13,740 --> 00:05:16,020
We get another glaciation.

72
00:05:16,020 --> 00:05:20,780
So Laureus's and Chacun's conclusion was the same as the conclusion of Kion and every

73
00:05:20,780 --> 00:05:27,500
other researcher in this field that carbon dioxide both lags and leads temperature rises.

74
00:05:27,500 --> 00:05:32,260
Kion explains all of this in his paper, but that wasn't mentioned in the Great Global

75
00:05:32,260 --> 00:05:33,820
Warming Swindle.

76
00:05:33,820 --> 00:05:38,600
Neither Kion nor Severinghaus nor Juzelle or any of the authors of the paper Durkin

77
00:05:38,600 --> 00:05:41,700
cited were interviewed for the film.

78
00:05:41,700 --> 00:05:47,620
Instead Durkin got a geochemist with no publishing history in this field to voice his beliefs.

79
00:05:47,620 --> 00:05:53,020
If he and Clark has some reason for believing that CO2 can't lead as well as lag, he doesn't

80
00:05:53,020 --> 00:05:57,820
tell us what it is, neither does he publish a paper showing his evidence.

81
00:05:57,820 --> 00:06:01,760
Of course it's possible that real climate researchers are all corrupt and hurriedly

82
00:06:01,760 --> 00:06:06,720
made up this nonsense in order to explain the embarrassing fact of the time lag, because

83
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:09,320
it threatened to scupper their hoax.

84
00:06:09,320 --> 00:06:13,400
Here's what civil engineer Frank Landsner wrote about the 800 year lag on What's Up

85
00:06:13,400 --> 00:06:14,660
With That.

86
00:06:14,660 --> 00:06:19,760
This is the climate debate, so massive rescue missions have been launched to save the CO2

87
00:06:19,760 --> 00:06:25,280
hypothesis, so explanation for the unfortunate CO2 data is as follows.

88
00:06:25,280 --> 00:06:31,040
First a solar or orbital change induces some minor warming, cooling, and then CO2 raises

89
00:06:31,040 --> 00:06:37,120
or drops, after this it's the CO2 that drives the temperature up or down.

90
00:06:37,120 --> 00:06:40,140
Well that's more or less the theory in a nutshell.

91
00:06:40,140 --> 00:06:44,720
But if Landsner thinks this explanation was hurriedly cobbled together to explain away

92
00:06:44,720 --> 00:06:50,520
an unfortunate lag, he obviously hasn't looked at any of the scientific papers from decades

93
00:06:50,520 --> 00:06:51,520
past.

94
00:06:51,520 --> 00:06:55,500
I've done a trawl through the scientific literature and there was no question that

95
00:06:55,500 --> 00:07:01,080
since at least the 1980s researchers had been expecting carbon dioxide to lag the

96
00:07:01,080 --> 00:07:02,980
initial temperature rise.

97
00:07:02,980 --> 00:07:07,180
The only question at the time was, how big would the lag be?

98
00:07:07,180 --> 00:07:13,780
Neftel et al. in 1988 thought CO2 probably lagged by less than 1,200 years.

99
00:07:13,780 --> 00:07:20,060
A 1990 paper by Lorius et al. predicted a lag of between a decade and over 100 years.

100
00:07:20,060 --> 00:07:25,940
A paper by Barnola et al. estimated the lag time at less than 1,000 years.

101
00:07:25,940 --> 00:07:31,500
So why were they all so sure that CO2 lagged the initial temperature rise?

102
00:07:31,500 --> 00:07:35,600
Because there had never been any question of it not doing that, I couldn't find any

103
00:07:35,600 --> 00:07:41,980
papers suggesting that carbon dioxide led temperature rise at the end of each glaciation.

104
00:07:41,980 --> 00:07:47,180
Here's a paper going back half a century, explaining how orbital forcing was the likely

105
00:07:47,180 --> 00:07:52,260
cause, and by the 1970s that explanation was widely accepted.

106
00:07:52,260 --> 00:07:56,260
And by the 1970s, positive feedback was also well understood.

107
00:07:56,260 --> 00:07:59,260
Here's a Nature paper from 1972.

108
00:07:59,260 --> 00:08:04,500
It was talking about warming predicted because of a 20th century rise in carbon dioxide,

109
00:08:04,500 --> 00:08:08,100
but the same principle applies whatever the cause of warming.

110
00:08:08,100 --> 00:08:13,340
A rise in temperature of the oceans will itself release additional CO2 to the atmosphere and

111
00:08:13,340 --> 00:08:19,180
provide a positive feedback, tending to enhance slightly the carbon dioxide effect.

112
00:08:19,180 --> 00:08:24,380
This paper by Soutsman also describes how carbon dioxide released from a warming ocean

113
00:08:24,380 --> 00:08:27,540
amplifies initial warming.

114
00:08:27,540 --> 00:08:32,340
Just as Lorius and Barnola had predicted, and other researchers have confirmed, it was

115
00:08:32,340 --> 00:08:37,700
positive feedback that defrosted the planet, not orbital forcing.

116
00:08:37,700 --> 00:08:42,260
But this myth that the unexpected discovery of a lag has turned climate theory on its

117
00:08:42,260 --> 00:08:47,820
head has persisted simply because it's been copied and pasted again and again for the

118
00:08:47,820 --> 00:08:52,700
internet version of the scientific literature, the blogosphere.

119
00:08:52,700 --> 00:08:57,060
Even this year, when the Niels Bohr Institute in Denmark published yet another paper on

120
00:08:57,060 --> 00:09:02,220
what's become the standard model of deglaciation, this time calculating the time lag at much

121
00:09:02,220 --> 00:09:08,940
less than 800 years, the bloggers still saw it as confirmation that CO2 always lags temperature

122
00:09:08,940 --> 00:09:11,300
and therefore cannot lead.

123
00:09:11,340 --> 00:09:15,140
Introducing the study on what's up with that, Anthony Watts wrote,

124
00:09:15,140 --> 00:09:20,500
The question of which comes first, the temperature or the CO2 rise, has been much like the proverbial

125
00:09:20,500 --> 00:09:23,420
which came first, the chicken or the egg question.

126
00:09:23,420 --> 00:09:25,080
This seems to settle it.

127
00:09:25,080 --> 00:09:29,580
Temperature came first, followed by an increase in CO2, outgassing from the oceans surrounding

128
00:09:29,580 --> 00:09:30,580
Antarctica.

129
00:09:30,580 --> 00:09:35,100
Well, welcome to a conclusion that was first reached 40 years ago.

130
00:09:35,100 --> 00:09:38,620
Sorry, but this isn't like the chicken or the egg question.

131
00:09:38,740 --> 00:09:40,940
The authors have known for decades which came first.

132
00:09:40,940 --> 00:09:46,340
I know I'm repeating myself, but just how hard is it to check these past papers?

133
00:09:46,340 --> 00:09:51,100
Even the news release accompanying the study and reprinted right below Watts' statement

134
00:09:51,100 --> 00:09:56,480
belied the chicken or the egg metaphor and confirmed exactly what I've been saying.

135
00:09:56,480 --> 00:10:00,180
It had previously been thought that as the temperature began to rise at the end of the

136
00:10:00,180 --> 00:10:06,100
ice age, an increase in the amount of CO2 in the atmosphere followed with a delay of

137
00:10:06,100 --> 00:10:08,560
up to 1,000 years.

138
00:10:08,560 --> 00:10:13,940
And further down, also reprinted on WhatsUp with that, the same news release said this,

139
00:10:13,940 --> 00:10:18,440
The global temperature changed naturally because of the changing solar radiation caused by

140
00:10:18,440 --> 00:10:23,620
variations in the Earth's orbit around the Sun, the Earth's tilt and the orientation

141
00:10:23,620 --> 00:10:25,580
of the Earth's axis.

142
00:10:25,580 --> 00:10:32,040
The natural warming of the climate was intensified by the increased amount of CO2 in the atmosphere.

143
00:10:32,040 --> 00:10:34,060
Sound familiar?

144
00:10:34,060 --> 00:10:39,060
This understanding of the CO2 lag is a pretty persistent myth, and it crops up all the time.

145
00:10:39,060 --> 00:10:44,180
It's not an easy one to understand because it's part fact and part fallacy, so you

146
00:10:44,180 --> 00:10:49,020
have to unravel what's actually in the scientific literature and what isn't.

147
00:10:49,020 --> 00:10:51,620
So let's sum all this up with a quick quiz.

148
00:10:51,620 --> 00:10:57,420
Published papers clearly, clearly shows that it is always the temperature rises first by

149
00:10:57,420 --> 00:11:01,460
at least several hundred years to a few thousand years.

150
00:11:01,460 --> 00:11:04,020
And then the carbon dioxide curve responds.

151
00:11:04,020 --> 00:11:09,540
True, if we're talking about the initial cause of deglaciations and Antarctic temperatures

152
00:11:09,540 --> 00:11:12,000
rather than global temperatures.

153
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:16,460
Willy soon doesn't make that clear, but let's give him a point anyway.

154
00:11:16,460 --> 00:11:21,120
And since researchers predicted this lag over 20 years ago, then of course they deserve

155
00:11:21,120 --> 00:11:23,180
a point too.

156
00:11:23,180 --> 00:11:25,100
Temperatures go up, then CO2 concentrations go up.

157
00:11:25,100 --> 00:11:26,620
CO2 does not drive temperatures.

158
00:11:26,620 --> 00:11:31,940
Carbon dioxide may in fact follow the atmosphere temperature change as opposed to being a leading

159
00:11:31,940 --> 00:11:32,940
indicator.

160
00:11:32,940 --> 00:11:33,940
False.

161
00:11:33,940 --> 00:11:37,780
If the only argument here is that something can't be both a cause and a product of that

162
00:11:37,780 --> 00:11:41,860
cause, because nature proves that wrong time and time again.

163
00:11:41,860 --> 00:11:44,500
The Amazon rainforest is a good example.

164
00:11:44,500 --> 00:11:48,940
More vegetation promotes evapotranspiration and encourages rainfall.

165
00:11:48,940 --> 00:11:51,640
More rainfall leads to more vegetation.

166
00:11:51,640 --> 00:11:55,140
More vegetation promotes evapotranspiration and so on.

167
00:11:55,140 --> 00:12:00,820
They said if the CO2 increases in the atmosphere as a greenhouse gas, then the temperature

168
00:12:00,820 --> 00:12:02,640
will go up.

169
00:12:02,640 --> 00:12:05,500
But the ice core record shows exactly the opposite.

170
00:12:05,500 --> 00:12:10,980
So the fundamental assumption, the most fundamental assumption of the whole theory of climate

171
00:12:10,980 --> 00:12:15,060
change due to humans is shown to be wrong.

172
00:12:15,060 --> 00:12:16,060
False.

173
00:12:16,060 --> 00:12:20,380
The most fundamental assumption for decades was that temperatures would rise first because

174
00:12:20,380 --> 00:12:21,980
of orbital forcing.

175
00:12:21,980 --> 00:12:23,900
Then carbon dioxide would rise.

176
00:12:23,900 --> 00:12:27,700
In that, carbon dioxide would cause further warming and the release of more greenhouse

177
00:12:27,700 --> 00:12:31,740
gases until the temperature stabilised at a much higher level.

178
00:12:31,740 --> 00:12:35,940
These assumptions, if Ball wants to call them that, turned out to be correct.

179
00:12:35,940 --> 00:12:40,940
At the end of that round of scores are...

180
00:12:40,940 --> 00:12:46,140
So either the critics don't know the whole story or they're deliberately ignoring it.

181
00:12:46,140 --> 00:12:50,900
I don't know which it is and as always I'm not going to ascribe motivation.

182
00:12:50,900 --> 00:12:56,140
All I can do is show what's in the scientific literature and cite the sources so that you

183
00:12:56,140 --> 00:12:56,700
can check it.
