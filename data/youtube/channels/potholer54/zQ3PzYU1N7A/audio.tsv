0	4520	In the first video of this series I looked at Al Gore's suggestion that this graph,
4520	9080	which comes from the Vostok ice core, shows carbon dioxide and temperature in lock step
9080	11960	over the last 400,000 years.
11960	16200	Just to recap I'll let the film The Great Global Warming Swindle counter that one.
16200	21760	So here we're looking at the ice core record from Vostok and in the red we see temperature
21760	27080	going up from early time to later time at a very key interval when we came out of a
27080	34240	glaciation and we see the temperature going up and then we see the CO2 coming up.
34240	41520	CO2 lags behind that increase, it's got an 800 year lag so temperature is leading CO2
41520	44000	by 800 years.
44000	48680	There have now been several major ice core surveys, every one of them shows the same
48680	49880	thing.
49880	56680	The temperature rises or falls and then after a few hundred years carbon dioxide follows.
56680	63320	So obviously carbon dioxide is not the cause of that warming, in fact we can say that the
63320	66880	warming produced the increase in carbon dioxide.
66880	71920	And that's absolutely right, researchers say carbon dioxide was not the cause of the initial
71920	75180	warming during any of the recent deglaciations.
75180	80020	The most likely trigger was the Milankovitch cycles, changes in the Earth's tilt and orbit
80020	82720	that caused more insulation.
82760	86960	In climatology, something that triggers higher temperatures is called a forcing.
86960	93240	So greater insulation due to the Earth's orbit is called orbital forcing or insulation forcing.
93240	97360	The problem is this explanation has given rise to yet another myth that I'm going to
97360	99620	deal with in this video.
99620	102800	But first, a quick recap of myth number one.
102800	106960	CO2 clearly cannot be causing temperature changes.
106960	110760	It's a product of temperature, it's following temperature changes.
110800	114920	Just because an increase in temperature puts more carbon dioxide into the atmosphere, which
114920	120400	is true, that doesn't preclude carbon dioxide also causing temperatures to rise.
120400	124760	Similarly, just because insulation causes temperature rises, that doesn't mean carbon
124760	127540	dioxide can't cause temperatures to rise.
127540	132200	Otherwise you could say that because kinetic energy can produce heat, then it must mean
132200	135320	that heat can't produce kinetic energy.
135320	139800	So let's go back to that graph which Durkin attributes to Kion et al.
139840	144640	He's probably referring to this famous 2003 paper in the journal Science, which is where
144640	147280	that 800 year lag comes from.
147280	151600	By the way, Kion says there's a margin of error of 200 years.
151600	156220	Kion was looking at the end of one of several glaciations during the ice age, this one called
156220	158040	Termination 3.
158040	162720	It marks the end of a glaciation about 240,000 years ago.
162720	167260	Durkin's correct in saying there's an 800 year lag, but he didn't tell his audience
167620	170440	what was in the rest of Kion's paper.
170440	175820	The data for the graph – here's the real one by Kion et al – comes from an ice core
175820	178860	at the Vostok station in Antarctica.
178860	183820	Since the 1980s, ice cores have been getting progressively deeper, and the 800 year lag
183820	189300	everyone now talks about comes from a core that was first analysed in 1999.
189300	194620	So Vostok doesn't record global temperatures, it records Antarctic temperatures.
194620	199820	And although temperature did indeed lead CO2 in Antarctica, Kion concluded that temperature
199820	204900	rises lagged CO2 in the northern hemisphere, and he said so in his paper.
204900	210500	A more recent paper by Shakun et al shows how much temperature leads CO2 in the southern
210500	214700	hemisphere, and how much it lags in the northern hemisphere.
214700	219540	The rise of CO2 level and the warming effect that produces is not only consistent with
219540	224340	observation, it also explains something that's otherwise inexplicable.
224340	230620	A paper by Lorius et al shows that insulation has varied by only 0.7 watts per square metre
230620	233580	over the last 160,000 years.
233580	237620	In other words, the tiny amount of forcing due to the Earth's orbit wasn't enough
237620	242100	to defrost miles of thick ice covering a large part of the planet.
242100	247140	It was the amplification of this initial warming by other factors – mostly greenhouse gases
247140	252020	– that gives us the complete picture, which goes like this.
252020	257260	The initial warming at the end of each glaciation was probably caused by orbital forcing.
257260	262020	Carbon dioxide in the atmosphere played little or no part in this initial warming, and because
262020	268060	CO2 is more soluble in colder water, a lot of it was dissolved in the deep oceans.
268060	273720	But the higher temperatures caused by orbital forcing led to stronger winds and warmer water.
273720	278420	Over several hundred years, that caused CO2 to circulate up from the ocean depths and
278420	281180	eventually degas at the surface.
281180	285940	As CO2 levels in the atmosphere rose, over the next few thousand years the greenhouse
285940	292420	effect gradually took over from orbital forcing to become the predominant cause of warming.
292420	297180	This amplification of the initial warming is a process known as positive feedback, which
297180	300640	I explained in the first video of this series.
300640	306140	Then as the Earth continues its wobble and erratic orbit, less insulation begins to fall
306140	311820	and that triggers lower temperatures, causes more atmospheric CO2 to dissolve in the oceans,
311820	313740	and the process goes into reverse.
313740	316020	We get another glaciation.
316020	320780	So Laureus's and Chacun's conclusion was the same as the conclusion of Kion and every
320780	327500	other researcher in this field that carbon dioxide both lags and leads temperature rises.
327500	332260	Kion explains all of this in his paper, but that wasn't mentioned in the Great Global
332260	333820	Warming Swindle.
333820	338600	Neither Kion nor Severinghaus nor Juzelle or any of the authors of the paper Durkin
338600	341700	cited were interviewed for the film.
341700	347620	Instead Durkin got a geochemist with no publishing history in this field to voice his beliefs.
347620	353020	If he and Clark has some reason for believing that CO2 can't lead as well as lag, he doesn't
353020	357820	tell us what it is, neither does he publish a paper showing his evidence.
357820	361760	Of course it's possible that real climate researchers are all corrupt and hurriedly
361760	366720	made up this nonsense in order to explain the embarrassing fact of the time lag, because
366720	369320	it threatened to scupper their hoax.
369320	373400	Here's what civil engineer Frank Landsner wrote about the 800 year lag on What's Up
373400	374660	With That.
374660	379760	This is the climate debate, so massive rescue missions have been launched to save the CO2
379760	385280	hypothesis, so explanation for the unfortunate CO2 data is as follows.
385280	391040	First a solar or orbital change induces some minor warming, cooling, and then CO2 raises
391040	397120	or drops, after this it's the CO2 that drives the temperature up or down.
397120	400140	Well that's more or less the theory in a nutshell.
400140	404720	But if Landsner thinks this explanation was hurriedly cobbled together to explain away
404720	410520	an unfortunate lag, he obviously hasn't looked at any of the scientific papers from decades
410520	411520	past.
411520	415500	I've done a trawl through the scientific literature and there was no question that
415500	421080	since at least the 1980s researchers had been expecting carbon dioxide to lag the
421080	422980	initial temperature rise.
422980	427180	The only question at the time was, how big would the lag be?
427180	433780	Neftel et al. in 1988 thought CO2 probably lagged by less than 1,200 years.
433780	440060	A 1990 paper by Lorius et al. predicted a lag of between a decade and over 100 years.
440060	445940	A paper by Barnola et al. estimated the lag time at less than 1,000 years.
445940	451500	So why were they all so sure that CO2 lagged the initial temperature rise?
451500	455600	Because there had never been any question of it not doing that, I couldn't find any
455600	461980	papers suggesting that carbon dioxide led temperature rise at the end of each glaciation.
461980	467180	Here's a paper going back half a century, explaining how orbital forcing was the likely
467180	472260	cause, and by the 1970s that explanation was widely accepted.
472260	476260	And by the 1970s, positive feedback was also well understood.
476260	479260	Here's a Nature paper from 1972.
479260	484500	It was talking about warming predicted because of a 20th century rise in carbon dioxide,
484500	488100	but the same principle applies whatever the cause of warming.
488100	493340	A rise in temperature of the oceans will itself release additional CO2 to the atmosphere and
493340	499180	provide a positive feedback, tending to enhance slightly the carbon dioxide effect.
499180	504380	This paper by Soutsman also describes how carbon dioxide released from a warming ocean
504380	507540	amplifies initial warming.
507540	512340	Just as Lorius and Barnola had predicted, and other researchers have confirmed, it was
512340	517700	positive feedback that defrosted the planet, not orbital forcing.
517700	522260	But this myth that the unexpected discovery of a lag has turned climate theory on its
522260	527820	head has persisted simply because it's been copied and pasted again and again for the
527820	532700	internet version of the scientific literature, the blogosphere.
532700	537060	Even this year, when the Niels Bohr Institute in Denmark published yet another paper on
537060	542220	what's become the standard model of deglaciation, this time calculating the time lag at much
542220	548940	less than 800 years, the bloggers still saw it as confirmation that CO2 always lags temperature
548940	551300	and therefore cannot lead.
551340	555140	Introducing the study on what's up with that, Anthony Watts wrote,
555140	560500	The question of which comes first, the temperature or the CO2 rise, has been much like the proverbial
560500	563420	which came first, the chicken or the egg question.
563420	565080	This seems to settle it.
565080	569580	Temperature came first, followed by an increase in CO2, outgassing from the oceans surrounding
569580	570580	Antarctica.
570580	575100	Well, welcome to a conclusion that was first reached 40 years ago.
575100	578620	Sorry, but this isn't like the chicken or the egg question.
578740	580940	The authors have known for decades which came first.
580940	586340	I know I'm repeating myself, but just how hard is it to check these past papers?
586340	591100	Even the news release accompanying the study and reprinted right below Watts' statement
591100	596480	belied the chicken or the egg metaphor and confirmed exactly what I've been saying.
596480	600180	It had previously been thought that as the temperature began to rise at the end of the
600180	606100	ice age, an increase in the amount of CO2 in the atmosphere followed with a delay of
606100	608560	up to 1,000 years.
608560	613940	And further down, also reprinted on WhatsUp with that, the same news release said this,
613940	618440	The global temperature changed naturally because of the changing solar radiation caused by
618440	623620	variations in the Earth's orbit around the Sun, the Earth's tilt and the orientation
623620	625580	of the Earth's axis.
625580	632040	The natural warming of the climate was intensified by the increased amount of CO2 in the atmosphere.
632040	634060	Sound familiar?
634060	639060	This understanding of the CO2 lag is a pretty persistent myth, and it crops up all the time.
639060	644180	It's not an easy one to understand because it's part fact and part fallacy, so you
644180	649020	have to unravel what's actually in the scientific literature and what isn't.
649020	651620	So let's sum all this up with a quick quiz.
651620	657420	Published papers clearly, clearly shows that it is always the temperature rises first by
657420	661460	at least several hundred years to a few thousand years.
661460	664020	And then the carbon dioxide curve responds.
664020	669540	True, if we're talking about the initial cause of deglaciations and Antarctic temperatures
669540	672000	rather than global temperatures.
672000	676460	Willy soon doesn't make that clear, but let's give him a point anyway.
676460	681120	And since researchers predicted this lag over 20 years ago, then of course they deserve
681120	683180	a point too.
683180	685100	Temperatures go up, then CO2 concentrations go up.
685100	686620	CO2 does not drive temperatures.
686620	691940	Carbon dioxide may in fact follow the atmosphere temperature change as opposed to being a leading
691940	692940	indicator.
692940	693940	False.
693940	697780	If the only argument here is that something can't be both a cause and a product of that
697780	701860	cause, because nature proves that wrong time and time again.
701860	704500	The Amazon rainforest is a good example.
704500	708940	More vegetation promotes evapotranspiration and encourages rainfall.
708940	711640	More rainfall leads to more vegetation.
711640	715140	More vegetation promotes evapotranspiration and so on.
715140	720820	They said if the CO2 increases in the atmosphere as a greenhouse gas, then the temperature
720820	722640	will go up.
722640	725500	But the ice core record shows exactly the opposite.
725500	730980	So the fundamental assumption, the most fundamental assumption of the whole theory of climate
730980	735060	change due to humans is shown to be wrong.
735060	736060	False.
736060	740380	The most fundamental assumption for decades was that temperatures would rise first because
740380	741980	of orbital forcing.
741980	743900	Then carbon dioxide would rise.
743900	747700	In that, carbon dioxide would cause further warming and the release of more greenhouse
747700	751740	gases until the temperature stabilised at a much higher level.
751740	755940	These assumptions, if Ball wants to call them that, turned out to be correct.
755940	760940	At the end of that round of scores are...
760940	766140	So either the critics don't know the whole story or they're deliberately ignoring it.
766140	770900	I don't know which it is and as always I'm not going to ascribe motivation.
770900	776140	All I can do is show what's in the scientific literature and cite the sources so that you
776140	776700	can check it.
