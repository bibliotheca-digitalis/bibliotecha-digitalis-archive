00:00.000 --> 00:04.520
In the first video of this series I looked at Al Gore's suggestion that this graph,

00:04.520 --> 00:09.080
which comes from the Vostok ice core, shows carbon dioxide and temperature in lock step

00:09.080 --> 00:11.960
over the last 400,000 years.

00:11.960 --> 00:16.200
Just to recap I'll let the film The Great Global Warming Swindle counter that one.

00:16.200 --> 00:21.760
So here we're looking at the ice core record from Vostok and in the red we see temperature

00:21.760 --> 00:27.080
going up from early time to later time at a very key interval when we came out of a

00:27.080 --> 00:34.240
glaciation and we see the temperature going up and then we see the CO2 coming up.

00:34.240 --> 00:41.520
CO2 lags behind that increase, it's got an 800 year lag so temperature is leading CO2

00:41.520 --> 00:44.000
by 800 years.

00:44.000 --> 00:48.680
There have now been several major ice core surveys, every one of them shows the same

00:48.680 --> 00:49.880
thing.

00:49.880 --> 00:56.680
The temperature rises or falls and then after a few hundred years carbon dioxide follows.

00:56.680 --> 01:03.320
So obviously carbon dioxide is not the cause of that warming, in fact we can say that the

01:03.320 --> 01:06.880
warming produced the increase in carbon dioxide.

01:06.880 --> 01:11.920
And that's absolutely right, researchers say carbon dioxide was not the cause of the initial

01:11.920 --> 01:15.180
warming during any of the recent deglaciations.

01:15.180 --> 01:20.020
The most likely trigger was the Milankovitch cycles, changes in the Earth's tilt and orbit

01:20.020 --> 01:22.720
that caused more insulation.

01:22.760 --> 01:26.960
In climatology, something that triggers higher temperatures is called a forcing.

01:26.960 --> 01:33.240
So greater insulation due to the Earth's orbit is called orbital forcing or insulation forcing.

01:33.240 --> 01:37.360
The problem is this explanation has given rise to yet another myth that I'm going to

01:37.360 --> 01:39.620
deal with in this video.

01:39.620 --> 01:42.800
But first, a quick recap of myth number one.

01:42.800 --> 01:46.960
CO2 clearly cannot be causing temperature changes.

01:46.960 --> 01:50.760
It's a product of temperature, it's following temperature changes.

01:50.800 --> 01:54.920
Just because an increase in temperature puts more carbon dioxide into the atmosphere, which

01:54.920 --> 02:00.400
is true, that doesn't preclude carbon dioxide also causing temperatures to rise.

02:00.400 --> 02:04.760
Similarly, just because insulation causes temperature rises, that doesn't mean carbon

02:04.760 --> 02:07.540
dioxide can't cause temperatures to rise.

02:07.540 --> 02:12.200
Otherwise you could say that because kinetic energy can produce heat, then it must mean

02:12.200 --> 02:15.320
that heat can't produce kinetic energy.

02:15.320 --> 02:19.800
So let's go back to that graph which Durkin attributes to Kion et al.

02:19.840 --> 02:24.640
He's probably referring to this famous 2003 paper in the journal Science, which is where

02:24.640 --> 02:27.280
that 800 year lag comes from.

02:27.280 --> 02:31.600
By the way, Kion says there's a margin of error of 200 years.

02:31.600 --> 02:36.220
Kion was looking at the end of one of several glaciations during the ice age, this one called

02:36.220 --> 02:38.040
Termination 3.

02:38.040 --> 02:42.720
It marks the end of a glaciation about 240,000 years ago.

02:42.720 --> 02:47.260
Durkin's correct in saying there's an 800 year lag, but he didn't tell his audience

02:47.620 --> 02:50.440
what was in the rest of Kion's paper.

02:50.440 --> 02:55.820
The data for the graph – here's the real one by Kion et al – comes from an ice core

02:55.820 --> 02:58.860
at the Vostok station in Antarctica.

02:58.860 --> 03:03.820
Since the 1980s, ice cores have been getting progressively deeper, and the 800 year lag

03:03.820 --> 03:09.300
everyone now talks about comes from a core that was first analysed in 1999.

03:09.300 --> 03:14.620
So Vostok doesn't record global temperatures, it records Antarctic temperatures.

03:14.620 --> 03:19.820
And although temperature did indeed lead CO2 in Antarctica, Kion concluded that temperature

03:19.820 --> 03:24.900
rises lagged CO2 in the northern hemisphere, and he said so in his paper.

03:24.900 --> 03:30.500
A more recent paper by Shakun et al shows how much temperature leads CO2 in the southern

03:30.500 --> 03:34.700
hemisphere, and how much it lags in the northern hemisphere.

03:34.700 --> 03:39.540
The rise of CO2 level and the warming effect that produces is not only consistent with

03:39.540 --> 03:44.340
observation, it also explains something that's otherwise inexplicable.

03:44.340 --> 03:50.620
A paper by Lorius et al shows that insulation has varied by only 0.7 watts per square metre

03:50.620 --> 03:53.580
over the last 160,000 years.

03:53.580 --> 03:57.620
In other words, the tiny amount of forcing due to the Earth's orbit wasn't enough

03:57.620 --> 04:02.100
to defrost miles of thick ice covering a large part of the planet.

04:02.100 --> 04:07.140
It was the amplification of this initial warming by other factors – mostly greenhouse gases

04:07.140 --> 04:12.020
– that gives us the complete picture, which goes like this.

04:12.020 --> 04:17.260
The initial warming at the end of each glaciation was probably caused by orbital forcing.

04:17.260 --> 04:22.020
Carbon dioxide in the atmosphere played little or no part in this initial warming, and because

04:22.020 --> 04:28.060
CO2 is more soluble in colder water, a lot of it was dissolved in the deep oceans.

04:28.060 --> 04:33.720
But the higher temperatures caused by orbital forcing led to stronger winds and warmer water.

04:33.720 --> 04:38.420
Over several hundred years, that caused CO2 to circulate up from the ocean depths and

04:38.420 --> 04:41.180
eventually degas at the surface.

04:41.180 --> 04:45.940
As CO2 levels in the atmosphere rose, over the next few thousand years the greenhouse

04:45.940 --> 04:52.420
effect gradually took over from orbital forcing to become the predominant cause of warming.

04:52.420 --> 04:57.180
This amplification of the initial warming is a process known as positive feedback, which

04:57.180 --> 05:00.640
I explained in the first video of this series.

05:00.640 --> 05:06.140
Then as the Earth continues its wobble and erratic orbit, less insulation begins to fall

05:06.140 --> 05:11.820
and that triggers lower temperatures, causes more atmospheric CO2 to dissolve in the oceans,

05:11.820 --> 05:13.740
and the process goes into reverse.

05:13.740 --> 05:16.020
We get another glaciation.

05:16.020 --> 05:20.780
So Laureus's and Chacun's conclusion was the same as the conclusion of Kion and every

05:20.780 --> 05:27.500
other researcher in this field that carbon dioxide both lags and leads temperature rises.

05:27.500 --> 05:32.260
Kion explains all of this in his paper, but that wasn't mentioned in the Great Global

05:32.260 --> 05:33.820
Warming Swindle.

05:33.820 --> 05:38.600
Neither Kion nor Severinghaus nor Juzelle or any of the authors of the paper Durkin

05:38.600 --> 05:41.700
cited were interviewed for the film.

05:41.700 --> 05:47.620
Instead Durkin got a geochemist with no publishing history in this field to voice his beliefs.

05:47.620 --> 05:53.020
If he and Clark has some reason for believing that CO2 can't lead as well as lag, he doesn't

05:53.020 --> 05:57.820
tell us what it is, neither does he publish a paper showing his evidence.

05:57.820 --> 06:01.760
Of course it's possible that real climate researchers are all corrupt and hurriedly

06:01.760 --> 06:06.720
made up this nonsense in order to explain the embarrassing fact of the time lag, because

06:06.720 --> 06:09.320
it threatened to scupper their hoax.

06:09.320 --> 06:13.400
Here's what civil engineer Frank Landsner wrote about the 800 year lag on What's Up

06:13.400 --> 06:14.660
With That.

06:14.660 --> 06:19.760
This is the climate debate, so massive rescue missions have been launched to save the CO2

06:19.760 --> 06:25.280
hypothesis, so explanation for the unfortunate CO2 data is as follows.

06:25.280 --> 06:31.040
First a solar or orbital change induces some minor warming, cooling, and then CO2 raises

06:31.040 --> 06:37.120
or drops, after this it's the CO2 that drives the temperature up or down.

06:37.120 --> 06:40.140
Well that's more or less the theory in a nutshell.

06:40.140 --> 06:44.720
But if Landsner thinks this explanation was hurriedly cobbled together to explain away

06:44.720 --> 06:50.520
an unfortunate lag, he obviously hasn't looked at any of the scientific papers from decades

06:50.520 --> 06:51.520
past.

06:51.520 --> 06:55.500
I've done a trawl through the scientific literature and there was no question that

06:55.500 --> 07:01.080
since at least the 1980s researchers had been expecting carbon dioxide to lag the

07:01.080 --> 07:02.980
initial temperature rise.

07:02.980 --> 07:07.180
The only question at the time was, how big would the lag be?

07:07.180 --> 07:13.780
Neftel et al. in 1988 thought CO2 probably lagged by less than 1,200 years.

07:13.780 --> 07:20.060
A 1990 paper by Lorius et al. predicted a lag of between a decade and over 100 years.

07:20.060 --> 07:25.940
A paper by Barnola et al. estimated the lag time at less than 1,000 years.

07:25.940 --> 07:31.500
So why were they all so sure that CO2 lagged the initial temperature rise?

07:31.500 --> 07:35.600
Because there had never been any question of it not doing that, I couldn't find any

07:35.600 --> 07:41.980
papers suggesting that carbon dioxide led temperature rise at the end of each glaciation.

07:41.980 --> 07:47.180
Here's a paper going back half a century, explaining how orbital forcing was the likely

07:47.180 --> 07:52.260
cause, and by the 1970s that explanation was widely accepted.

07:52.260 --> 07:56.260
And by the 1970s, positive feedback was also well understood.

07:56.260 --> 07:59.260
Here's a Nature paper from 1972.

07:59.260 --> 08:04.500
It was talking about warming predicted because of a 20th century rise in carbon dioxide,

08:04.500 --> 08:08.100
but the same principle applies whatever the cause of warming.

08:08.100 --> 08:13.340
A rise in temperature of the oceans will itself release additional CO2 to the atmosphere and

08:13.340 --> 08:19.180
provide a positive feedback, tending to enhance slightly the carbon dioxide effect.

08:19.180 --> 08:24.380
This paper by Soutsman also describes how carbon dioxide released from a warming ocean

08:24.380 --> 08:27.540
amplifies initial warming.

08:27.540 --> 08:32.340
Just as Lorius and Barnola had predicted, and other researchers have confirmed, it was

08:32.340 --> 08:37.700
positive feedback that defrosted the planet, not orbital forcing.

08:37.700 --> 08:42.260
But this myth that the unexpected discovery of a lag has turned climate theory on its

08:42.260 --> 08:47.820
head has persisted simply because it's been copied and pasted again and again for the

08:47.820 --> 08:52.700
internet version of the scientific literature, the blogosphere.

08:52.700 --> 08:57.060
Even this year, when the Niels Bohr Institute in Denmark published yet another paper on

08:57.060 --> 09:02.220
what's become the standard model of deglaciation, this time calculating the time lag at much

09:02.220 --> 09:08.940
less than 800 years, the bloggers still saw it as confirmation that CO2 always lags temperature

09:08.940 --> 09:11.300
and therefore cannot lead.

09:11.340 --> 09:15.140
Introducing the study on what's up with that, Anthony Watts wrote,

09:15.140 --> 09:20.500
The question of which comes first, the temperature or the CO2 rise, has been much like the proverbial

09:20.500 --> 09:23.420
which came first, the chicken or the egg question.

09:23.420 --> 09:25.080
This seems to settle it.

09:25.080 --> 09:29.580
Temperature came first, followed by an increase in CO2, outgassing from the oceans surrounding

09:29.580 --> 09:30.580
Antarctica.

09:30.580 --> 09:35.100
Well, welcome to a conclusion that was first reached 40 years ago.

09:35.100 --> 09:38.620
Sorry, but this isn't like the chicken or the egg question.

09:38.740 --> 09:40.940
The authors have known for decades which came first.

09:40.940 --> 09:46.340
I know I'm repeating myself, but just how hard is it to check these past papers?

09:46.340 --> 09:51.100
Even the news release accompanying the study and reprinted right below Watts' statement

09:51.100 --> 09:56.480
belied the chicken or the egg metaphor and confirmed exactly what I've been saying.

09:56.480 --> 10:00.180
It had previously been thought that as the temperature began to rise at the end of the

10:00.180 --> 10:06.100
ice age, an increase in the amount of CO2 in the atmosphere followed with a delay of

10:06.100 --> 10:08.560
up to 1,000 years.

10:08.560 --> 10:13.940
And further down, also reprinted on WhatsUp with that, the same news release said this,

10:13.940 --> 10:18.440
The global temperature changed naturally because of the changing solar radiation caused by

10:18.440 --> 10:23.620
variations in the Earth's orbit around the Sun, the Earth's tilt and the orientation

10:23.620 --> 10:25.580
of the Earth's axis.

10:25.580 --> 10:32.040
The natural warming of the climate was intensified by the increased amount of CO2 in the atmosphere.

10:32.040 --> 10:34.060
Sound familiar?

10:34.060 --> 10:39.060
This understanding of the CO2 lag is a pretty persistent myth, and it crops up all the time.

10:39.060 --> 10:44.180
It's not an easy one to understand because it's part fact and part fallacy, so you

10:44.180 --> 10:49.020
have to unravel what's actually in the scientific literature and what isn't.

10:49.020 --> 10:51.620
So let's sum all this up with a quick quiz.

10:51.620 --> 10:57.420
Published papers clearly, clearly shows that it is always the temperature rises first by

10:57.420 --> 11:01.460
at least several hundred years to a few thousand years.

11:01.460 --> 11:04.020
And then the carbon dioxide curve responds.

11:04.020 --> 11:09.540
True, if we're talking about the initial cause of deglaciations and Antarctic temperatures

11:09.540 --> 11:12.000
rather than global temperatures.

11:12.000 --> 11:16.460
Willy soon doesn't make that clear, but let's give him a point anyway.

11:16.460 --> 11:21.120
And since researchers predicted this lag over 20 years ago, then of course they deserve

11:21.120 --> 11:23.180
a point too.

11:23.180 --> 11:25.100
Temperatures go up, then CO2 concentrations go up.

11:25.100 --> 11:26.620
CO2 does not drive temperatures.

11:26.620 --> 11:31.940
Carbon dioxide may in fact follow the atmosphere temperature change as opposed to being a leading

11:31.940 --> 11:32.940
indicator.

11:32.940 --> 11:33.940
False.

11:33.940 --> 11:37.780
If the only argument here is that something can't be both a cause and a product of that

11:37.780 --> 11:41.860
cause, because nature proves that wrong time and time again.

11:41.860 --> 11:44.500
The Amazon rainforest is a good example.

11:44.500 --> 11:48.940
More vegetation promotes evapotranspiration and encourages rainfall.

11:48.940 --> 11:51.640
More rainfall leads to more vegetation.

11:51.640 --> 11:55.140
More vegetation promotes evapotranspiration and so on.

11:55.140 --> 12:00.820
They said if the CO2 increases in the atmosphere as a greenhouse gas, then the temperature

12:00.820 --> 12:02.640
will go up.

12:02.640 --> 12:05.500
But the ice core record shows exactly the opposite.

12:05.500 --> 12:10.980
So the fundamental assumption, the most fundamental assumption of the whole theory of climate

12:10.980 --> 12:15.060
change due to humans is shown to be wrong.

12:15.060 --> 12:16.060
False.

12:16.060 --> 12:20.380
The most fundamental assumption for decades was that temperatures would rise first because

12:20.380 --> 12:21.980
of orbital forcing.

12:21.980 --> 12:23.900
Then carbon dioxide would rise.

12:23.900 --> 12:27.700
In that, carbon dioxide would cause further warming and the release of more greenhouse

12:27.700 --> 12:31.740
gases until the temperature stabilised at a much higher level.

12:31.740 --> 12:35.940
These assumptions, if Ball wants to call them that, turned out to be correct.

12:35.940 --> 12:40.940
At the end of that round of scores are...

12:40.940 --> 12:46.140
So either the critics don't know the whole story or they're deliberately ignoring it.

12:46.140 --> 12:50.900
I don't know which it is and as always I'm not going to ascribe motivation.

12:50.900 --> 12:56.140
All I can do is show what's in the scientific literature and cite the sources so that you

12:56.140 --> 12:56.700
can check it.
