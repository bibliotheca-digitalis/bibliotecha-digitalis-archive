00:00.000 --> 00:05.580
Of all the blogs and essays speculating that the SARS-CoV-2 virus was man-made, this one

00:05.580 --> 00:10.180
seems to have got the most attention, so I'm happy to take up the numerous requests and

00:10.180 --> 00:13.000
challenges for me to fact-check it.

00:13.000 --> 00:18.680
It's by someone called Nicholas Wade. Who's he? According to one poster on the forum,

00:18.680 --> 00:24.420
he's a well-respected journalist with a 30-plus year track record who used to write for Nature

00:24.420 --> 00:29.760
magazine and the New York Times. Unfortunately, you can't assume he's got everything right

00:29.760 --> 00:34.680
by simply having a bit of faith and weighing up the credibility of any journalist based

00:34.680 --> 00:40.160
on their experience, reputation and track record. If that was the case, then Wade would

00:40.160 --> 00:45.000
actually be off to a pretty bad start, because he doesn't have a great track record of accurate

00:45.000 --> 00:50.080
reporting and he has a pretty low reputation among the scientific community for getting

00:50.080 --> 00:52.000
his facts straight.

00:52.000 --> 00:58.040
Fortunately, fact-checking isn't about personalities. It's about checking someone's source to see

00:58.040 --> 01:04.320
if his claim matches. So even a journalist with a great track record can get things wrong,

01:04.320 --> 01:09.320
and even a journalist with a terrible track record can get things right.

01:09.320 --> 01:14.120
Neither can you assume that the Bulletin of Atomic Scientists has fact-checked his piece

01:14.120 --> 01:18.320
because it's not a peer-reviewed journal. I can't go through the whole thing in a short

01:18.320 --> 01:25.060
video, and it includes a range of arguments from politics and personalities to hard science.

01:25.100 --> 01:31.060
My beat is the science, but whatever I choose to debunk, I could be cherry-picking. So I

01:31.060 --> 01:35.900
asked people on the Forum, who cited Wade's essay, to pick the most convincing piece of

01:35.900 --> 01:42.020
scientific evidence that they found to support the idea that the virus is man-made. They

01:42.020 --> 01:47.540
cited Wade's critique of the Nature Medicine Study by Anderson et al, the seamless method

01:47.540 --> 01:53.860
of genome manipulation, and a claim about a National Institute of Health funding brief.

01:53.860 --> 01:56.220
So let's go through them.

01:56.220 --> 01:59.740
You could start with this take-down of Dr Anderson's letter to the Journal of Nature

01:59.740 --> 02:06.420
Medicine, as this was the main basis for your strong claim that it was not lab-made. Just

02:06.420 --> 02:12.380
to be clear, I'm a complete idiot, so I can't make any such claim. I can only tell you what

02:12.380 --> 02:17.620
the science says. It's the science that shows it's man-made. If you have some personal,

02:17.620 --> 02:22.320
political or religious belief that leads you to reject scientific conclusions, that's fine

02:22.320 --> 02:28.160
with me. This is the part of Wade's claim that deals with the Nature Medicine Study.

02:28.160 --> 02:33.280
According to Wade, a second statement that had enormous influence in shaping public attitudes

02:33.280 --> 02:39.580
was a letter, in other words an opinion piece, not a scientific article. This is the study

02:39.580 --> 02:45.400
he's referring to, and his claim that it's just an opinion piece is inaccurate and very

02:45.400 --> 02:52.240
misleading. Firstly, it's listed as an article in the correspondence section of Nature Medicine.

02:52.240 --> 02:56.880
A correspondence article is certainly less than a peer-reviewed paper, but it's more

02:56.880 --> 03:01.720
than just an opinion piece, unless you consider inferences in science to be nothing more than

03:01.720 --> 03:08.560
opinions. The correspondence section of Nature Medicine is a forum for professional researchers,

03:08.560 --> 03:13.800
and articles published there still have to adhere to scientific principles. The scientific

03:13.800 --> 03:19.280
evidence, methodology and inferences presented in correspondence articles can be responded

03:19.280 --> 03:25.680
to corrected, confirmed or disproved, just like any other published study. Far from being

03:25.680 --> 03:31.320
disproved or corrected, the article, authored by senior virology researchers from the Scripps

03:31.320 --> 03:36.520
Institute, Tulane University, the University of Sydney, the University of Edinburgh and

03:36.520 --> 03:43.600
Columbia University, has been cited by over 3,000 scientific studies. Wade goes on to

03:43.600 --> 03:49.080
say, the discussion part of the letter begins, it is improbable that SARS-CoV-2 emerged through

03:49.080 --> 03:56.280
laboratory manipulation of a related SARS-CoV-like coronavirus. But wait, didn't the lead say

03:56.280 --> 04:03.320
the virus had clearly not been manipulated? Actually, no, it didn't say that at all. What

04:03.320 --> 04:09.960
it said was, our analyses clearly show that SARS-CoV-2 is not a laboratory construct,

04:09.960 --> 04:16.800
or a purposefully manipulated virus. If you think what Wade says means the same thing

04:16.800 --> 04:22.920
as what the authors said, why did he need to change it? As I explained in my video,

04:22.920 --> 04:28.280
The Scientific Method Made Easy, the word show in a scientific paper means something

04:28.280 --> 04:33.960
has been demonstrated scientifically. Taking that word out completely changed this from

04:33.960 --> 04:40.440
a scientific inference based on the evidence provided into an opinion based on dogma. When

04:40.440 --> 04:45.800
the correct wording is put back, there's nothing contradictory in these two terms at

04:45.800 --> 04:51.600
all. For example, the fossil and stratigraphical evidence clearly shows that animals evolved

04:51.600 --> 04:57.540
over billions of years. The reason this is called the theory of evolution is that science

04:57.540 --> 05:02.220
can never rule out the possibility that they were placed there by aliens or popped into

05:02.220 --> 05:07.560
existence at the whim of a deity, who cleverly arranged things to look as though animals

05:07.560 --> 05:14.220
had evolved over time. It's just that such an event is improbable.

05:14.220 --> 05:18.920
As far as substance goes, Wade criticises two claims made by the authors of the Nature

05:18.920 --> 05:25.320
Medicine article. Wade says, first they say the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 binds very

05:25.320 --> 05:30.680
well to its target, the human ACE2 receptor, but does so in a different way from that which

05:30.680 --> 05:36.640
physical calculations suggest would be the best fit. Therefore, the virus must have arisen

05:36.640 --> 05:42.760
by natural selection, not manipulation. If that's all the authors had said, then

05:42.760 --> 05:48.240
Wade could be forgiven for thinking the inference doesn't match the evidence. In fact, what

05:48.240 --> 05:55.020
the authors show is a lot stronger and more detailed than just that one short sentence.

05:55.020 --> 06:00.140
Another part of the virus spike protein that binds to the ACE2 receptor in a human cell

06:00.140 --> 06:05.740
is called the receptor binding domain, the RBD. The Nature Medicine article explains

06:05.740 --> 06:12.840
that five of the amino acids that make up the RBD aren't found in other SARS-CoV viruses.

06:12.840 --> 06:18.060
So that's one piece of strong evidence against manipulation. When researchers are trying

06:18.060 --> 06:23.740
to see how close a natural zoonotic virus is to becoming infectious, they want to make

06:23.740 --> 06:29.700
as few changes as possible to just get it to that point. There'd be no point in spending

06:29.700 --> 06:34.340
time and effort replacing five out of the six amino acids.

06:34.340 --> 06:38.420
The other strong piece of evidence is that these radical changes wouldn't be expected

06:38.420 --> 06:45.160
to work anyway. Researchers always run calculations first to see what effect any change might

06:45.160 --> 06:50.640
have. They don't do things willy-nilly by trial and error, that would just be wasting

06:50.640 --> 06:55.960
their time. The Nature Medicine authors discovered that computation analyses predict that the

06:55.960 --> 07:02.520
interaction is not ideal. In other words, those changes are unlikely to work.

07:02.520 --> 07:07.360
So again, no point in doing them. Because while lab researchers wouldn't waste their

07:07.360 --> 07:12.720
time coming up with weird and inefficient structures that are unlikely to work, nature

07:12.720 --> 07:18.480
does it all the time. Because it works not by calculation, but through a process of trial

07:18.480 --> 07:22.620
and error. So there's a lot more evidence than Wade's

07:22.620 --> 07:28.860
simplistic summation. A good example of how evolution comes out with odd and counterintuitive

07:28.860 --> 07:35.540
designs is easier to see in this example. This hand has wrist bones for swivelling and

07:35.540 --> 07:41.000
an intricate array of knuckles, fingers and a thumb, perfect for grasping branches, picking

07:41.000 --> 07:46.680
up food and fashioning tools. It looks like an example of something intelligently designed

07:46.680 --> 07:52.920
for its purpose. Except it's not a hand, it's a remnant of evolution inside a dolphin's

07:52.920 --> 07:57.820
flipper. An intelligent designer wouldn't have bothered spending time and effort coming

07:57.820 --> 08:03.760
up with a pointless and intricate system of wrist bones, knuckles, fingers and thumbs,

08:03.760 --> 08:09.480
or if you prefer, ankles, tarsals, metatarsals and toes, to put them inside a flipper where

08:09.480 --> 08:15.120
they can't be used. But the hit and miss approach of evolution throws up all kinds of oddities

08:15.120 --> 08:22.400
like this all the time, not only in the animal world, but in the world of viruses too.

08:22.400 --> 08:28.600
So Wade is firstly misquoting and then completely misrepresenting the author's evidence and

08:28.600 --> 08:34.400
their conclusion. The problem is that most people don't read the study, they just read

08:34.400 --> 08:41.640
Wade's summary of what he claims the study says. Wade goes on to say, the author's basic

08:41.640 --> 08:47.160
assumption, not spelled out, is that anyone trying to make a bat virus bind to human cells

08:47.160 --> 08:53.080
could do so in only one way. First they would calculate the strongest possible fit between

08:53.080 --> 08:58.680
the human ACE2 receptor and the spike protein with which the virus latches onto it. Then

08:58.680 --> 09:03.440
they would design the spike protein. But the reason that's not spelled out is because that's

09:03.440 --> 09:08.460
not the author's assumption. It's Wade's assumption that that's how virus research

09:08.460 --> 09:14.940
is done. The authors know better because they're virology researchers themselves.

09:14.940 --> 09:19.420
Researchers in this field are not looking for the strongest possible fit. As I explained

09:19.420 --> 09:24.740
earlier, they're trying to determine how close a natural virus is to infecting humans, a

09:24.740 --> 09:29.300
transition known as spillover. So they're looking for the minimal number of changes

09:29.300 --> 09:36.100
needed for a possible fit. Wade then tells the virology researchers, again, how he thinks

09:36.100 --> 09:42.200
they do their job. And again, he gets it wrong. This ignores the way that virologists do,

09:42.200 --> 09:47.700
in fact, get spike proteins to bind to chosen targets, which is not by calculation, but

09:47.700 --> 09:54.260
by splicing in spike protein genes from other viruses or by serial passage.

09:54.260 --> 09:58.480
The authors aren't ignoring Wade's imagined account of how they do their research. They

09:58.480 --> 10:03.780
happen to know that researchers in this field do make their calculations first, and then

10:03.780 --> 10:09.600
they get the spike proteins to bind to chosen targets based on those calculations. How many

10:09.600 --> 10:14.200
of the people who were convinced by Wade's essay actually bothered to check the Nature

10:14.200 --> 10:19.940
Medicine article to see if it says what Wade claims it says.

10:19.940 --> 10:24.900
Wade's next argument against the Nature Medicine article concerns the nature of the virus backbone,

10:24.900 --> 10:30.800
which I covered in my first video on the origin of SARS-CoV-2. I said this. When researchers

10:30.800 --> 10:36.140
are bioengineering a virus, they usually don't build the entire thing from scratch.

10:36.140 --> 10:41.180
What they're interested in is the business end of the virus, called the spike proteins.

10:41.180 --> 10:46.520
They house the receptor binding domain, the RBD, where the virus attaches itself to the

10:46.520 --> 10:52.980
host cell, and the cleavage sites, where it breaks in and enters the cell. So, except

10:52.980 --> 10:58.260
in exceptional circumstances, they build the spike proteins onto the structure of an existing

10:58.260 --> 11:04.680
infectious virus. I suppose the best analogy is graffiti artists. They usually don't

11:04.680 --> 11:09.880
spend lots of time and money building an entire wall from scratch in order to spray paint

11:09.880 --> 11:13.960
their art. They find an existing wall and use that.

11:13.960 --> 11:19.120
Wade doesn't dispute the fact that virologists use existing backbones in their research or

11:19.120 --> 11:24.560
that the SARS-CoV-2 backbone is novel, but he argues that researchers might have built

11:24.560 --> 11:32.380
it themselves because, he says, backbones are quite easy to make. So it's possible.

11:32.380 --> 11:37.860
Since he doesn't quantify how easy it is, we need to check his source and find out.

11:37.860 --> 11:45.240
Unfortunately, as so often in his essay, he doesn't give a source, it's just his assumption.

11:45.240 --> 11:50.740
Since Wade has no expertise in this field, we need to find out from a real research virologist

11:50.740 --> 11:55.980
how easy it is to make a novel backbone. A couple of researchers I spoke to thought

11:55.980 --> 12:01.300
it would take years, and when I did a search online, I found that the Ben Hur-Lee lab,

12:01.300 --> 12:07.520
which does research in this field, says making a new backbone takes months or even years.

12:07.520 --> 12:13.020
Robert Gary, a professor of microbiology and immunology at Tulane University and one of

12:13.020 --> 12:18.420
the authors of the Nature Medicine study, didn't even think it was possible. He told

12:18.420 --> 12:23.900
Business Insider, people just don't know enough about what makes a virus pathogenic

12:23.900 --> 12:31.140
to be able to assemble that. So quite easy varies from a few months to impossible. But

12:31.140 --> 12:37.120
even if we take the lowest estimate of a few months, why would any researcher bother? After

12:37.120 --> 12:42.140
all, researchers are trying to see how close a virus is to spill over, and that's why all

12:42.140 --> 12:48.160
their research is focused on this, the spike protein, the infectious part of the virus.

12:48.160 --> 12:52.960
They don't need to spend time, effort and money trying to build a completely new backbone,

12:52.960 --> 12:59.240
and Wade doesn't explain why they would, except he assumes it's quite easy.

12:59.240 --> 13:04.640
Using the analogy, when most of us see something like this, we'd say it clearly shows that

13:04.640 --> 13:09.440
someone spray painted a rock. We wouldn't seriously entertain the idea that someone

13:09.440 --> 13:15.240
took time, effort and money to buy a lot of gravel melted in a furnace to make the rock

13:15.240 --> 13:20.540
and then go to even greater efforts to make the rock look perfectly natural. I think we'd

13:20.540 --> 13:27.180
all agree that such a pointless and time consuming exercise is improbable. The more obvious and

13:27.180 --> 13:33.080
simple explanation is that someone's just spray painted a rock. It's a principle known

13:33.080 --> 13:39.640
as Occam's Razor. Wade closes the section on the Nature Science paper by saying, and

13:39.640 --> 13:44.620
that's it. These are the two arguments made by the Anderson group in support of their

13:44.620 --> 13:49.420
declaration that the SARS-2 virus was clearly not manipulated.

13:49.420 --> 13:55.220
Well, that's not quite it. First of all, this wasn't a declaration, it was an inference

13:55.220 --> 14:01.600
based on the evidence that Wade mostly misrepresented. Secondly, there was a lot more in the study

14:01.600 --> 14:07.060
than just two arguments, and certainly a lot that's very different to Wade's two line

14:07.060 --> 14:14.180
misquotes. He continues, and this conclusion, grounded in nothing but two inconclusive speculations,

14:14.420 --> 14:19.860
convinced the world's press that SARS-2 could not have escaped from a lab. Again, they certainly

14:19.860 --> 14:26.500
weren't inconclusive speculations. They were very detailed and very conclusive. But you

14:26.500 --> 14:31.580
wouldn't know that if all you read was Wade's inaccurate summation.

14:31.580 --> 14:36.060
It isn't the world's press that was convinced by the Nature Medicine Study. It's unlikely

14:36.060 --> 14:41.340
most journalists read it. It was thousands of virology researchers who cited it in their

14:41.340 --> 14:46.740
own research papers, like these ones. They were convinced because they're professional

14:46.740 --> 14:53.100
researchers who didn't see these scientific inferences as inconclusive speculations. They

14:53.100 --> 14:58.100
did read the study and they did understand it. That's why they cited it.

14:58.100 --> 15:02.340
So we'll move on to the second poster who asked me to fact check Wade's essay. He

15:02.340 --> 15:06.820
wrote, I think the most important part to address there would be where he talks about

15:06.820 --> 15:12.660
the seamless method of genome manipulation. Here's the part of Wade's essay being referred

15:12.660 --> 15:19.100
to. Wade says, Unfortunately, this was another case of poor science, in the sense defined

15:19.100 --> 15:24.660
above. True, some older methods of cutting and pasting viral genomes retain telltale

15:24.660 --> 15:30.740
signs of manipulation, but newer methods, called noceum or seamless approaches, leave

15:30.740 --> 15:35.640
no defining marks. But the authors aren't arguing that cutting

15:35.640 --> 15:41.880
and pasting viral genomes retains telltale signs of manipulation, or that it represents

15:41.880 --> 15:48.120
any kind of evidence that SARS-CoV-2 is natural. This seems to be an argument Wade has invented

15:48.120 --> 15:54.800
himself, just so he can knock it down, which he then proceeds to do. He says, But newer

15:54.800 --> 16:00.760
methods, called noceum or seamless approaches, leave no defining marks, nor do other methods

16:00.760 --> 16:05.600
for manipulating viruses, such as serial passage, the repeated transfer of viruses

16:05.600 --> 16:10.560
from one culture of cells to another. If a virus has been manipulated, whether with a

16:10.560 --> 16:16.380
seamless method or by serial passage, there's no way of knowing that this is the case. Anderson

16:16.380 --> 16:22.120
and his colleagues were assuring their readers of something they could not know. But Anderson

16:22.120 --> 16:26.460
and his colleagues weren't trying to assure readers of anything of the sort. They never

16:26.460 --> 16:30.400
even mentioned it. No one's trying to argue that there might

16:30.400 --> 16:36.180
or might not be telltale signs of manipulation. It's irrelevant. It's the fact that these

16:36.180 --> 16:42.580
features are there at all, which shows a natural evolutionary path. The noceum technique is

16:42.580 --> 16:47.500
a method of gene insertion used in cloning. It doesn't mean we can't see these new

16:47.500 --> 16:52.600
genetic sequences, so it doesn't affect the evidence at all.

16:52.600 --> 16:56.880
Going back to the example of a hand inside a dolphin's flipper, I'm equally happy

16:56.880 --> 17:01.480
to accept a creationist's argument that any intelligent designer could have done

17:01.480 --> 17:08.000
this without leaving any incriminating toolmarks. But that's not the point. It's the fact

17:08.000 --> 17:13.220
that all these hand bones are in there that argues against intelligent design, because

17:13.220 --> 17:18.000
an intelligent designer wouldn't have bothered with all these pointless and complex design

17:18.000 --> 17:23.440
features. And we can see transitions for some of these changes, just as we can see

17:23.440 --> 17:30.740
the pathway to many of the odd and counter-intuitive features of SARS-CoV-2 in other viruses.

17:30.740 --> 17:35.600
On to the next argument in Wade's essay that someone said is the most convincing.

17:35.600 --> 17:41.960
The poster C-Panic gave this example, so again, this is his choice, not my cherry pick. Look

17:41.960 --> 17:48.640
at this section. This is the grant from NIH. C-Panic then quoted part of a National Institute

17:48.640 --> 17:53.880
of Health grant document addressed to the Wuhan Institute of Virology, which has a brief

17:53.880 --> 18:00.800
laying out what its funding is to be used for. C-Panic then explained. What this means,

18:00.800 --> 18:04.400
in non-technical language, he said, is that she set out to create…

18:04.400 --> 18:09.940
But wait a minute. This is just a huge chunk of text lifted directly from Wade's essay.

18:09.940 --> 18:15.660
This is what Wade thinks it means. So how do we know he's understood it, or that he's

18:15.660 --> 18:19.980
explaining it accurately? The good news is that Wade gives a source

18:19.980 --> 18:26.340
for his claims, which means it can be easily checked. This is the NIH funding brief he's

18:26.340 --> 18:32.000
referring to, and he even quotes the section of the document he's referring to. Wade

18:32.000 --> 18:37.740
claims it instructs Dr Shee, the researcher, to create novel coronaviruses with the highest

18:37.740 --> 18:44.100
possible infectivity for human cells, which, if true, would be an incredibly reckless and

18:44.100 --> 18:50.180
dangerous thing for any lab to do. Making the most infectious virus possible is the

18:50.180 --> 18:55.120
recipe for a terror weapon. And even if you believe that there was a conspiracy to make

18:55.120 --> 19:01.340
such a weapon, it would be a bit odd for the United States to fund such research in China,

19:01.340 --> 19:06.100
and odder still that it would be spelled out in a publicly available document.

19:06.100 --> 19:11.260
So wherever else you think this conspiracy is being played out, it's certainly not in

19:11.260 --> 19:15.620
the document Wade's citing, or in the passage he cites.

19:15.620 --> 19:20.840
As I mentioned earlier, the spillover potential of a naturally occurring virus means the potential

19:20.840 --> 19:26.840
of the virus to mutate into a form that can infect humans. So researchers need to identify

19:26.840 --> 19:33.060
which of the many viruses found in nature is closest to this point. In other words,

19:33.060 --> 19:38.320
the idea is to make as few changes as possible to the spike protein just to get to the point

19:38.320 --> 19:44.520
where spillover will occur, not to make the most infectious virus. The reason for doing

19:44.520 --> 19:49.640
this is it helps predict which of the viruses in nature is closest to becoming infectious

19:49.640 --> 19:53.920
to humans. Wade compounds his error by adding,

19:53.920 --> 19:58.480
The methodical approach was designed to find the best combination of coronavirus backbone

19:58.480 --> 20:05.140
and spike protein for infecting human cells. I found it very hard to believe the NIH brief

20:05.140 --> 20:10.620
said this, because it's funding research into the infectivity of the virus, which doesn't

20:10.620 --> 20:16.820
come from the backbone, it comes from the spike protein. As we've seen, for experimentation

20:16.820 --> 20:22.820
purposes researchers simply pick a backbone off the shelf. And when I searched for anything

20:22.820 --> 20:29.280
resembling this claim in Wade's source, I couldn't find it and Wade doesn't quote it.

20:29.280 --> 20:34.680
So that's the problem with believing Wade on the basis that he sounds credible or assuming

20:34.680 --> 20:40.700
he has a good track record as a science journalist. So those were supposedly the most convincing

20:40.700 --> 20:46.160
pieces of scientific evidence in Wade's essay, not picked by me but by people on the

20:46.160 --> 20:51.720
forum who responded when asked. Of course, now that this has been addressed, I have no

20:51.720 --> 20:57.000
doubt it'll be answered with the what about arguments. What about the rest of Wade's essay?

20:57.000 --> 21:03.520
What about this blog or that video? What about something else? All I can say is, guys, even

21:03.520 --> 21:08.980
if I had time to make a hundred videos a year in order to whack down every new misunderstanding

21:08.980 --> 21:14.020
and misquote that pops up on the internet, you don't need me to fact check this stuff

21:14.020 --> 21:20.340
anyway. You can fact check it yourself. Wade asks why virologists don't make the

21:20.340 --> 21:26.640
same claims he's making. It can't be because he's wrong. It must be because researchers

21:26.640 --> 21:32.280
are all corrupt. As with climate change, evolution and every other scientific conclusion that

21:32.280 --> 21:37.400
people don't want to believe, they use the standard fallback position that scientists

21:37.400 --> 21:43.020
don't risk having their next grant application turned down. I've covered this default excuse

21:43.020 --> 21:48.320
in several videos. If the research conflicts with your belief, it can't be because you're

21:48.320 --> 21:54.200
wrong. The research must be wrong, and therefore all the researchers must be corrupt. The simple

21:54.200 --> 21:58.960
fact of the matter is that other virologists don't contradict the published science because

21:58.960 --> 22:02.380
they've ascertained that the published science is correct.

22:02.380 --> 22:07.560
Finally, if you're seeing ads on this video, it's because I've now monetised the channel

22:07.560 --> 22:13.140
and have made Health in Harmony the beneficiary of the income. Health in Harmony is the charity

22:13.140 --> 22:17.920
that I've been asking people to support if they want to support this channel, so if you

22:17.920 --> 22:22.260
want to find out more about it, take a look at the links in the video description. And

22:22.260 --> 22:27.000
for those who've donated in the past, thanks very much for doing so, and I hope many of

22:27.000 --> 22:32.680
you will continue to donate in the future, even though we now have advertisements running.

22:32.680 --> 22:37.560
If you're not seeing ads on this video, then that's due to my pathetic technology skills.
