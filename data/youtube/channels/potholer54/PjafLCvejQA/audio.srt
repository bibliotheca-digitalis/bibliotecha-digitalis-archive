1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,580
Of all the blogs and essays speculating that the SARS-CoV-2 virus was man-made, this one

2
00:00:05,580 --> 00:00:10,180
seems to have got the most attention, so I'm happy to take up the numerous requests and

3
00:00:10,180 --> 00:00:13,000
challenges for me to fact-check it.

4
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:18,680
It's by someone called Nicholas Wade. Who's he? According to one poster on the forum,

5
00:00:18,680 --> 00:00:24,420
he's a well-respected journalist with a 30-plus year track record who used to write for Nature

6
00:00:24,420 --> 00:00:29,760
magazine and the New York Times. Unfortunately, you can't assume he's got everything right

7
00:00:29,760 --> 00:00:34,680
by simply having a bit of faith and weighing up the credibility of any journalist based

8
00:00:34,680 --> 00:00:40,160
on their experience, reputation and track record. If that was the case, then Wade would

9
00:00:40,160 --> 00:00:45,000
actually be off to a pretty bad start, because he doesn't have a great track record of accurate

10
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:50,080
reporting and he has a pretty low reputation among the scientific community for getting

11
00:00:50,080 --> 00:00:52,000
his facts straight.

12
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:58,040
Fortunately, fact-checking isn't about personalities. It's about checking someone's source to see

13
00:00:58,040 --> 00:01:04,320
if his claim matches. So even a journalist with a great track record can get things wrong,

14
00:01:04,320 --> 00:01:09,320
and even a journalist with a terrible track record can get things right.

15
00:01:09,320 --> 00:01:14,120
Neither can you assume that the Bulletin of Atomic Scientists has fact-checked his piece

16
00:01:14,120 --> 00:01:18,320
because it's not a peer-reviewed journal. I can't go through the whole thing in a short

17
00:01:18,320 --> 00:01:25,060
video, and it includes a range of arguments from politics and personalities to hard science.

18
00:01:25,100 --> 00:01:31,060
My beat is the science, but whatever I choose to debunk, I could be cherry-picking. So I

19
00:01:31,060 --> 00:01:35,900
asked people on the Forum, who cited Wade's essay, to pick the most convincing piece of

20
00:01:35,900 --> 00:01:42,020
scientific evidence that they found to support the idea that the virus is man-made. They

21
00:01:42,020 --> 00:01:47,540
cited Wade's critique of the Nature Medicine Study by Anderson et al, the seamless method

22
00:01:47,540 --> 00:01:53,860
of genome manipulation, and a claim about a National Institute of Health funding brief.

23
00:01:53,860 --> 00:01:56,220
So let's go through them.

24
00:01:56,220 --> 00:01:59,740
You could start with this take-down of Dr Anderson's letter to the Journal of Nature

25
00:01:59,740 --> 00:02:06,420
Medicine, as this was the main basis for your strong claim that it was not lab-made. Just

26
00:02:06,420 --> 00:02:12,380
to be clear, I'm a complete idiot, so I can't make any such claim. I can only tell you what

27
00:02:12,380 --> 00:02:17,620
the science says. It's the science that shows it's man-made. If you have some personal,

28
00:02:17,620 --> 00:02:22,320
political or religious belief that leads you to reject scientific conclusions, that's fine

29
00:02:22,320 --> 00:02:28,160
with me. This is the part of Wade's claim that deals with the Nature Medicine Study.

30
00:02:28,160 --> 00:02:33,280
According to Wade, a second statement that had enormous influence in shaping public attitudes

31
00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:39,580
was a letter, in other words an opinion piece, not a scientific article. This is the study

32
00:02:39,580 --> 00:02:45,400
he's referring to, and his claim that it's just an opinion piece is inaccurate and very

33
00:02:45,400 --> 00:02:52,240
misleading. Firstly, it's listed as an article in the correspondence section of Nature Medicine.

34
00:02:52,240 --> 00:02:56,880
A correspondence article is certainly less than a peer-reviewed paper, but it's more

35
00:02:56,880 --> 00:03:01,720
than just an opinion piece, unless you consider inferences in science to be nothing more than

36
00:03:01,720 --> 00:03:08,560
opinions. The correspondence section of Nature Medicine is a forum for professional researchers,

37
00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:13,800
and articles published there still have to adhere to scientific principles. The scientific

38
00:03:13,800 --> 00:03:19,280
evidence, methodology and inferences presented in correspondence articles can be responded

39
00:03:19,280 --> 00:03:25,680
to corrected, confirmed or disproved, just like any other published study. Far from being

40
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:31,320
disproved or corrected, the article, authored by senior virology researchers from the Scripps

41
00:03:31,320 --> 00:03:36,520
Institute, Tulane University, the University of Sydney, the University of Edinburgh and

42
00:03:36,520 --> 00:03:43,600
Columbia University, has been cited by over 3,000 scientific studies. Wade goes on to

43
00:03:43,600 --> 00:03:49,080
say, the discussion part of the letter begins, it is improbable that SARS-CoV-2 emerged through

44
00:03:49,080 --> 00:03:56,280
laboratory manipulation of a related SARS-CoV-like coronavirus. But wait, didn't the lead say

45
00:03:56,280 --> 00:04:03,320
the virus had clearly not been manipulated? Actually, no, it didn't say that at all. What

46
00:04:03,320 --> 00:04:09,960
it said was, our analyses clearly show that SARS-CoV-2 is not a laboratory construct,

47
00:04:09,960 --> 00:04:16,800
or a purposefully manipulated virus. If you think what Wade says means the same thing

48
00:04:16,800 --> 00:04:22,920
as what the authors said, why did he need to change it? As I explained in my video,

49
00:04:22,920 --> 00:04:28,280
The Scientific Method Made Easy, the word show in a scientific paper means something

50
00:04:28,280 --> 00:04:33,960
has been demonstrated scientifically. Taking that word out completely changed this from

51
00:04:33,960 --> 00:04:40,440
a scientific inference based on the evidence provided into an opinion based on dogma. When

52
00:04:40,440 --> 00:04:45,800
the correct wording is put back, there's nothing contradictory in these two terms at

53
00:04:45,800 --> 00:04:51,600
all. For example, the fossil and stratigraphical evidence clearly shows that animals evolved

54
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:57,540
over billions of years. The reason this is called the theory of evolution is that science

55
00:04:57,540 --> 00:05:02,220
can never rule out the possibility that they were placed there by aliens or popped into

56
00:05:02,220 --> 00:05:07,560
existence at the whim of a deity, who cleverly arranged things to look as though animals

57
00:05:07,560 --> 00:05:14,220
had evolved over time. It's just that such an event is improbable.

58
00:05:14,220 --> 00:05:18,920
As far as substance goes, Wade criticises two claims made by the authors of the Nature

59
00:05:18,920 --> 00:05:25,320
Medicine article. Wade says, first they say the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 binds very

60
00:05:25,320 --> 00:05:30,680
well to its target, the human ACE2 receptor, but does so in a different way from that which

61
00:05:30,680 --> 00:05:36,640
physical calculations suggest would be the best fit. Therefore, the virus must have arisen

62
00:05:36,640 --> 00:05:42,760
by natural selection, not manipulation. If that's all the authors had said, then

63
00:05:42,760 --> 00:05:48,240
Wade could be forgiven for thinking the inference doesn't match the evidence. In fact, what

64
00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:55,020
the authors show is a lot stronger and more detailed than just that one short sentence.

65
00:05:55,020 --> 00:06:00,140
Another part of the virus spike protein that binds to the ACE2 receptor in a human cell

66
00:06:00,140 --> 00:06:05,740
is called the receptor binding domain, the RBD. The Nature Medicine article explains

67
00:06:05,740 --> 00:06:12,840
that five of the amino acids that make up the RBD aren't found in other SARS-CoV viruses.

68
00:06:12,840 --> 00:06:18,060
So that's one piece of strong evidence against manipulation. When researchers are trying

69
00:06:18,060 --> 00:06:23,740
to see how close a natural zoonotic virus is to becoming infectious, they want to make

70
00:06:23,740 --> 00:06:29,700
as few changes as possible to just get it to that point. There'd be no point in spending

71
00:06:29,700 --> 00:06:34,340
time and effort replacing five out of the six amino acids.

72
00:06:34,340 --> 00:06:38,420
The other strong piece of evidence is that these radical changes wouldn't be expected

73
00:06:38,420 --> 00:06:45,160
to work anyway. Researchers always run calculations first to see what effect any change might

74
00:06:45,160 --> 00:06:50,640
have. They don't do things willy-nilly by trial and error, that would just be wasting

75
00:06:50,640 --> 00:06:55,960
their time. The Nature Medicine authors discovered that computation analyses predict that the

76
00:06:55,960 --> 00:07:02,520
interaction is not ideal. In other words, those changes are unlikely to work.

77
00:07:02,520 --> 00:07:07,360
So again, no point in doing them. Because while lab researchers wouldn't waste their

78
00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:12,720
time coming up with weird and inefficient structures that are unlikely to work, nature

79
00:07:12,720 --> 00:07:18,480
does it all the time. Because it works not by calculation, but through a process of trial

80
00:07:18,480 --> 00:07:22,620
and error. So there's a lot more evidence than Wade's

81
00:07:22,620 --> 00:07:28,860
simplistic summation. A good example of how evolution comes out with odd and counterintuitive

82
00:07:28,860 --> 00:07:35,540
designs is easier to see in this example. This hand has wrist bones for swivelling and

83
00:07:35,540 --> 00:07:41,000
an intricate array of knuckles, fingers and a thumb, perfect for grasping branches, picking

84
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:46,680
up food and fashioning tools. It looks like an example of something intelligently designed

85
00:07:46,680 --> 00:07:52,920
for its purpose. Except it's not a hand, it's a remnant of evolution inside a dolphin's

86
00:07:52,920 --> 00:07:57,820
flipper. An intelligent designer wouldn't have bothered spending time and effort coming

87
00:07:57,820 --> 00:08:03,760
up with a pointless and intricate system of wrist bones, knuckles, fingers and thumbs,

88
00:08:03,760 --> 00:08:09,480
or if you prefer, ankles, tarsals, metatarsals and toes, to put them inside a flipper where

89
00:08:09,480 --> 00:08:15,120
they can't be used. But the hit and miss approach of evolution throws up all kinds of oddities

90
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:22,400
like this all the time, not only in the animal world, but in the world of viruses too.

91
00:08:22,400 --> 00:08:28,600
So Wade is firstly misquoting and then completely misrepresenting the author's evidence and

92
00:08:28,600 --> 00:08:34,400
their conclusion. The problem is that most people don't read the study, they just read

93
00:08:34,400 --> 00:08:41,640
Wade's summary of what he claims the study says. Wade goes on to say, the author's basic

94
00:08:41,640 --> 00:08:47,160
assumption, not spelled out, is that anyone trying to make a bat virus bind to human cells

95
00:08:47,160 --> 00:08:53,080
could do so in only one way. First they would calculate the strongest possible fit between

96
00:08:53,080 --> 00:08:58,680
the human ACE2 receptor and the spike protein with which the virus latches onto it. Then

97
00:08:58,680 --> 00:09:03,440
they would design the spike protein. But the reason that's not spelled out is because that's

98
00:09:03,440 --> 00:09:08,460
not the author's assumption. It's Wade's assumption that that's how virus research

99
00:09:08,460 --> 00:09:14,940
is done. The authors know better because they're virology researchers themselves.

100
00:09:14,940 --> 00:09:19,420
Researchers in this field are not looking for the strongest possible fit. As I explained

101
00:09:19,420 --> 00:09:24,740
earlier, they're trying to determine how close a natural virus is to infecting humans, a

102
00:09:24,740 --> 00:09:29,300
transition known as spillover. So they're looking for the minimal number of changes

103
00:09:29,300 --> 00:09:36,100
needed for a possible fit. Wade then tells the virology researchers, again, how he thinks

104
00:09:36,100 --> 00:09:42,200
they do their job. And again, he gets it wrong. This ignores the way that virologists do,

105
00:09:42,200 --> 00:09:47,700
in fact, get spike proteins to bind to chosen targets, which is not by calculation, but

106
00:09:47,700 --> 00:09:54,260
by splicing in spike protein genes from other viruses or by serial passage.

107
00:09:54,260 --> 00:09:58,480
The authors aren't ignoring Wade's imagined account of how they do their research. They

108
00:09:58,480 --> 00:10:03,780
happen to know that researchers in this field do make their calculations first, and then

109
00:10:03,780 --> 00:10:09,600
they get the spike proteins to bind to chosen targets based on those calculations. How many

110
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:14,200
of the people who were convinced by Wade's essay actually bothered to check the Nature

111
00:10:14,200 --> 00:10:19,940
Medicine article to see if it says what Wade claims it says.

112
00:10:19,940 --> 00:10:24,900
Wade's next argument against the Nature Medicine article concerns the nature of the virus backbone,

113
00:10:24,900 --> 00:10:30,800
which I covered in my first video on the origin of SARS-CoV-2. I said this. When researchers

114
00:10:30,800 --> 00:10:36,140
are bioengineering a virus, they usually don't build the entire thing from scratch.

115
00:10:36,140 --> 00:10:41,180
What they're interested in is the business end of the virus, called the spike proteins.

116
00:10:41,180 --> 00:10:46,520
They house the receptor binding domain, the RBD, where the virus attaches itself to the

117
00:10:46,520 --> 00:10:52,980
host cell, and the cleavage sites, where it breaks in and enters the cell. So, except

118
00:10:52,980 --> 00:10:58,260
in exceptional circumstances, they build the spike proteins onto the structure of an existing

119
00:10:58,260 --> 00:11:04,680
infectious virus. I suppose the best analogy is graffiti artists. They usually don't

120
00:11:04,680 --> 00:11:09,880
spend lots of time and money building an entire wall from scratch in order to spray paint

121
00:11:09,880 --> 00:11:13,960
their art. They find an existing wall and use that.

122
00:11:13,960 --> 00:11:19,120
Wade doesn't dispute the fact that virologists use existing backbones in their research or

123
00:11:19,120 --> 00:11:24,560
that the SARS-CoV-2 backbone is novel, but he argues that researchers might have built

124
00:11:24,560 --> 00:11:32,380
it themselves because, he says, backbones are quite easy to make. So it's possible.

125
00:11:32,380 --> 00:11:37,860
Since he doesn't quantify how easy it is, we need to check his source and find out.

126
00:11:37,860 --> 00:11:45,240
Unfortunately, as so often in his essay, he doesn't give a source, it's just his assumption.

127
00:11:45,240 --> 00:11:50,740
Since Wade has no expertise in this field, we need to find out from a real research virologist

128
00:11:50,740 --> 00:11:55,980
how easy it is to make a novel backbone. A couple of researchers I spoke to thought

129
00:11:55,980 --> 00:12:01,300
it would take years, and when I did a search online, I found that the Ben Hur-Lee lab,

130
00:12:01,300 --> 00:12:07,520
which does research in this field, says making a new backbone takes months or even years.

131
00:12:07,520 --> 00:12:13,020
Robert Gary, a professor of microbiology and immunology at Tulane University and one of

132
00:12:13,020 --> 00:12:18,420
the authors of the Nature Medicine study, didn't even think it was possible. He told

133
00:12:18,420 --> 00:12:23,900
Business Insider, people just don't know enough about what makes a virus pathogenic

134
00:12:23,900 --> 00:12:31,140
to be able to assemble that. So quite easy varies from a few months to impossible. But

135
00:12:31,140 --> 00:12:37,120
even if we take the lowest estimate of a few months, why would any researcher bother? After

136
00:12:37,120 --> 00:12:42,140
all, researchers are trying to see how close a virus is to spill over, and that's why all

137
00:12:42,140 --> 00:12:48,160
their research is focused on this, the spike protein, the infectious part of the virus.

138
00:12:48,160 --> 00:12:52,960
They don't need to spend time, effort and money trying to build a completely new backbone,

139
00:12:52,960 --> 00:12:59,240
and Wade doesn't explain why they would, except he assumes it's quite easy.

140
00:12:59,240 --> 00:13:04,640
Using the analogy, when most of us see something like this, we'd say it clearly shows that

141
00:13:04,640 --> 00:13:09,440
someone spray painted a rock. We wouldn't seriously entertain the idea that someone

142
00:13:09,440 --> 00:13:15,240
took time, effort and money to buy a lot of gravel melted in a furnace to make the rock

143
00:13:15,240 --> 00:13:20,540
and then go to even greater efforts to make the rock look perfectly natural. I think we'd

144
00:13:20,540 --> 00:13:27,180
all agree that such a pointless and time consuming exercise is improbable. The more obvious and

145
00:13:27,180 --> 00:13:33,080
simple explanation is that someone's just spray painted a rock. It's a principle known

146
00:13:33,080 --> 00:13:39,640
as Occam's Razor. Wade closes the section on the Nature Science paper by saying, and

147
00:13:39,640 --> 00:13:44,620
that's it. These are the two arguments made by the Anderson group in support of their

148
00:13:44,620 --> 00:13:49,420
declaration that the SARS-2 virus was clearly not manipulated.

149
00:13:49,420 --> 00:13:55,220
Well, that's not quite it. First of all, this wasn't a declaration, it was an inference

150
00:13:55,220 --> 00:14:01,600
based on the evidence that Wade mostly misrepresented. Secondly, there was a lot more in the study

151
00:14:01,600 --> 00:14:07,060
than just two arguments, and certainly a lot that's very different to Wade's two line

152
00:14:07,060 --> 00:14:14,180
misquotes. He continues, and this conclusion, grounded in nothing but two inconclusive speculations,

153
00:14:14,420 --> 00:14:19,860
convinced the world's press that SARS-2 could not have escaped from a lab. Again, they certainly

154
00:14:19,860 --> 00:14:26,500
weren't inconclusive speculations. They were very detailed and very conclusive. But you

155
00:14:26,500 --> 00:14:31,580
wouldn't know that if all you read was Wade's inaccurate summation.

156
00:14:31,580 --> 00:14:36,060
It isn't the world's press that was convinced by the Nature Medicine Study. It's unlikely

157
00:14:36,060 --> 00:14:41,340
most journalists read it. It was thousands of virology researchers who cited it in their

158
00:14:41,340 --> 00:14:46,740
own research papers, like these ones. They were convinced because they're professional

159
00:14:46,740 --> 00:14:53,100
researchers who didn't see these scientific inferences as inconclusive speculations. They

160
00:14:53,100 --> 00:14:58,100
did read the study and they did understand it. That's why they cited it.

161
00:14:58,100 --> 00:15:02,340
So we'll move on to the second poster who asked me to fact check Wade's essay. He

162
00:15:02,340 --> 00:15:06,820
wrote, I think the most important part to address there would be where he talks about

163
00:15:06,820 --> 00:15:12,660
the seamless method of genome manipulation. Here's the part of Wade's essay being referred

164
00:15:12,660 --> 00:15:19,100
to. Wade says, Unfortunately, this was another case of poor science, in the sense defined

165
00:15:19,100 --> 00:15:24,660
above. True, some older methods of cutting and pasting viral genomes retain telltale

166
00:15:24,660 --> 00:15:30,740
signs of manipulation, but newer methods, called noceum or seamless approaches, leave

167
00:15:30,740 --> 00:15:35,640
no defining marks. But the authors aren't arguing that cutting

168
00:15:35,640 --> 00:15:41,880
and pasting viral genomes retains telltale signs of manipulation, or that it represents

169
00:15:41,880 --> 00:15:48,120
any kind of evidence that SARS-CoV-2 is natural. This seems to be an argument Wade has invented

170
00:15:48,120 --> 00:15:54,800
himself, just so he can knock it down, which he then proceeds to do. He says, But newer

171
00:15:54,800 --> 00:16:00,760
methods, called noceum or seamless approaches, leave no defining marks, nor do other methods

172
00:16:00,760 --> 00:16:05,600
for manipulating viruses, such as serial passage, the repeated transfer of viruses

173
00:16:05,600 --> 00:16:10,560
from one culture of cells to another. If a virus has been manipulated, whether with a

174
00:16:10,560 --> 00:16:16,380
seamless method or by serial passage, there's no way of knowing that this is the case. Anderson

175
00:16:16,380 --> 00:16:22,120
and his colleagues were assuring their readers of something they could not know. But Anderson

176
00:16:22,120 --> 00:16:26,460
and his colleagues weren't trying to assure readers of anything of the sort. They never

177
00:16:26,460 --> 00:16:30,400
even mentioned it. No one's trying to argue that there might

178
00:16:30,400 --> 00:16:36,180
or might not be telltale signs of manipulation. It's irrelevant. It's the fact that these

179
00:16:36,180 --> 00:16:42,580
features are there at all, which shows a natural evolutionary path. The noceum technique is

180
00:16:42,580 --> 00:16:47,500
a method of gene insertion used in cloning. It doesn't mean we can't see these new

181
00:16:47,500 --> 00:16:52,600
genetic sequences, so it doesn't affect the evidence at all.

182
00:16:52,600 --> 00:16:56,880
Going back to the example of a hand inside a dolphin's flipper, I'm equally happy

183
00:16:56,880 --> 00:17:01,480
to accept a creationist's argument that any intelligent designer could have done

184
00:17:01,480 --> 00:17:08,000
this without leaving any incriminating toolmarks. But that's not the point. It's the fact

185
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:13,220
that all these hand bones are in there that argues against intelligent design, because

186
00:17:13,220 --> 00:17:18,000
an intelligent designer wouldn't have bothered with all these pointless and complex design

187
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:23,440
features. And we can see transitions for some of these changes, just as we can see

188
00:17:23,440 --> 00:17:30,740
the pathway to many of the odd and counter-intuitive features of SARS-CoV-2 in other viruses.

189
00:17:30,740 --> 00:17:35,600
On to the next argument in Wade's essay that someone said is the most convincing.

190
00:17:35,600 --> 00:17:41,960
The poster C-Panic gave this example, so again, this is his choice, not my cherry pick. Look

191
00:17:41,960 --> 00:17:48,640
at this section. This is the grant from NIH. C-Panic then quoted part of a National Institute

192
00:17:48,640 --> 00:17:53,880
of Health grant document addressed to the Wuhan Institute of Virology, which has a brief

193
00:17:53,880 --> 00:18:00,800
laying out what its funding is to be used for. C-Panic then explained. What this means,

194
00:18:00,800 --> 00:18:04,400
in non-technical language, he said, is that she set out to create…

195
00:18:04,400 --> 00:18:09,940
But wait a minute. This is just a huge chunk of text lifted directly from Wade's essay.

196
00:18:09,940 --> 00:18:15,660
This is what Wade thinks it means. So how do we know he's understood it, or that he's

197
00:18:15,660 --> 00:18:19,980
explaining it accurately? The good news is that Wade gives a source

198
00:18:19,980 --> 00:18:26,340
for his claims, which means it can be easily checked. This is the NIH funding brief he's

199
00:18:26,340 --> 00:18:32,000
referring to, and he even quotes the section of the document he's referring to. Wade

200
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:37,740
claims it instructs Dr Shee, the researcher, to create novel coronaviruses with the highest

201
00:18:37,740 --> 00:18:44,100
possible infectivity for human cells, which, if true, would be an incredibly reckless and

202
00:18:44,100 --> 00:18:50,180
dangerous thing for any lab to do. Making the most infectious virus possible is the

203
00:18:50,180 --> 00:18:55,120
recipe for a terror weapon. And even if you believe that there was a conspiracy to make

204
00:18:55,120 --> 00:19:01,340
such a weapon, it would be a bit odd for the United States to fund such research in China,

205
00:19:01,340 --> 00:19:06,100
and odder still that it would be spelled out in a publicly available document.

206
00:19:06,100 --> 00:19:11,260
So wherever else you think this conspiracy is being played out, it's certainly not in

207
00:19:11,260 --> 00:19:15,620
the document Wade's citing, or in the passage he cites.

208
00:19:15,620 --> 00:19:20,840
As I mentioned earlier, the spillover potential of a naturally occurring virus means the potential

209
00:19:20,840 --> 00:19:26,840
of the virus to mutate into a form that can infect humans. So researchers need to identify

210
00:19:26,840 --> 00:19:33,060
which of the many viruses found in nature is closest to this point. In other words,

211
00:19:33,060 --> 00:19:38,320
the idea is to make as few changes as possible to the spike protein just to get to the point

212
00:19:38,320 --> 00:19:44,520
where spillover will occur, not to make the most infectious virus. The reason for doing

213
00:19:44,520 --> 00:19:49,640
this is it helps predict which of the viruses in nature is closest to becoming infectious

214
00:19:49,640 --> 00:19:53,920
to humans. Wade compounds his error by adding,

215
00:19:53,920 --> 00:19:58,480
The methodical approach was designed to find the best combination of coronavirus backbone

216
00:19:58,480 --> 00:20:05,140
and spike protein for infecting human cells. I found it very hard to believe the NIH brief

217
00:20:05,140 --> 00:20:10,620
said this, because it's funding research into the infectivity of the virus, which doesn't

218
00:20:10,620 --> 00:20:16,820
come from the backbone, it comes from the spike protein. As we've seen, for experimentation

219
00:20:16,820 --> 00:20:22,820
purposes researchers simply pick a backbone off the shelf. And when I searched for anything

220
00:20:22,820 --> 00:20:29,280
resembling this claim in Wade's source, I couldn't find it and Wade doesn't quote it.

221
00:20:29,280 --> 00:20:34,680
So that's the problem with believing Wade on the basis that he sounds credible or assuming

222
00:20:34,680 --> 00:20:40,700
he has a good track record as a science journalist. So those were supposedly the most convincing

223
00:20:40,700 --> 00:20:46,160
pieces of scientific evidence in Wade's essay, not picked by me but by people on the

224
00:20:46,160 --> 00:20:51,720
forum who responded when asked. Of course, now that this has been addressed, I have no

225
00:20:51,720 --> 00:20:57,000
doubt it'll be answered with the what about arguments. What about the rest of Wade's essay?

226
00:20:57,000 --> 00:21:03,520
What about this blog or that video? What about something else? All I can say is, guys, even

227
00:21:03,520 --> 00:21:08,980
if I had time to make a hundred videos a year in order to whack down every new misunderstanding

228
00:21:08,980 --> 00:21:14,020
and misquote that pops up on the internet, you don't need me to fact check this stuff

229
00:21:14,020 --> 00:21:20,340
anyway. You can fact check it yourself. Wade asks why virologists don't make the

230
00:21:20,340 --> 00:21:26,640
same claims he's making. It can't be because he's wrong. It must be because researchers

231
00:21:26,640 --> 00:21:32,280
are all corrupt. As with climate change, evolution and every other scientific conclusion that

232
00:21:32,280 --> 00:21:37,400
people don't want to believe, they use the standard fallback position that scientists

233
00:21:37,400 --> 00:21:43,020
don't risk having their next grant application turned down. I've covered this default excuse

234
00:21:43,020 --> 00:21:48,320
in several videos. If the research conflicts with your belief, it can't be because you're

235
00:21:48,320 --> 00:21:54,200
wrong. The research must be wrong, and therefore all the researchers must be corrupt. The simple

236
00:21:54,200 --> 00:21:58,960
fact of the matter is that other virologists don't contradict the published science because

237
00:21:58,960 --> 00:22:02,380
they've ascertained that the published science is correct.

238
00:22:02,380 --> 00:22:07,560
Finally, if you're seeing ads on this video, it's because I've now monetised the channel

239
00:22:07,560 --> 00:22:13,140
and have made Health in Harmony the beneficiary of the income. Health in Harmony is the charity

240
00:22:13,140 --> 00:22:17,920
that I've been asking people to support if they want to support this channel, so if you

241
00:22:17,920 --> 00:22:22,260
want to find out more about it, take a look at the links in the video description. And

242
00:22:22,260 --> 00:22:27,000
for those who've donated in the past, thanks very much for doing so, and I hope many of

243
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:32,680
you will continue to donate in the future, even though we now have advertisements running.

244
00:22:32,680 --> 00:22:37,560
If you're not seeing ads on this video, then that's due to my pathetic technology skills.
