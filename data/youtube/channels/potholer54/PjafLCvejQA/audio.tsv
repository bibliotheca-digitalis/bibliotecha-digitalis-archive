0	5580	Of all the blogs and essays speculating that the SARS-CoV-2 virus was man-made, this one
5580	10180	seems to have got the most attention, so I'm happy to take up the numerous requests and
10180	13000	challenges for me to fact-check it.
13000	18680	It's by someone called Nicholas Wade. Who's he? According to one poster on the forum,
18680	24420	he's a well-respected journalist with a 30-plus year track record who used to write for Nature
24420	29760	magazine and the New York Times. Unfortunately, you can't assume he's got everything right
29760	34680	by simply having a bit of faith and weighing up the credibility of any journalist based
34680	40160	on their experience, reputation and track record. If that was the case, then Wade would
40160	45000	actually be off to a pretty bad start, because he doesn't have a great track record of accurate
45000	50080	reporting and he has a pretty low reputation among the scientific community for getting
50080	52000	his facts straight.
52000	58040	Fortunately, fact-checking isn't about personalities. It's about checking someone's source to see
58040	64320	if his claim matches. So even a journalist with a great track record can get things wrong,
64320	69320	and even a journalist with a terrible track record can get things right.
69320	74120	Neither can you assume that the Bulletin of Atomic Scientists has fact-checked his piece
74120	78320	because it's not a peer-reviewed journal. I can't go through the whole thing in a short
78320	85060	video, and it includes a range of arguments from politics and personalities to hard science.
85100	91060	My beat is the science, but whatever I choose to debunk, I could be cherry-picking. So I
91060	95900	asked people on the Forum, who cited Wade's essay, to pick the most convincing piece of
95900	102020	scientific evidence that they found to support the idea that the virus is man-made. They
102020	107540	cited Wade's critique of the Nature Medicine Study by Anderson et al, the seamless method
107540	113860	of genome manipulation, and a claim about a National Institute of Health funding brief.
113860	116220	So let's go through them.
116220	119740	You could start with this take-down of Dr Anderson's letter to the Journal of Nature
119740	126420	Medicine, as this was the main basis for your strong claim that it was not lab-made. Just
126420	132380	to be clear, I'm a complete idiot, so I can't make any such claim. I can only tell you what
132380	137620	the science says. It's the science that shows it's man-made. If you have some personal,
137620	142320	political or religious belief that leads you to reject scientific conclusions, that's fine
142320	148160	with me. This is the part of Wade's claim that deals with the Nature Medicine Study.
148160	153280	According to Wade, a second statement that had enormous influence in shaping public attitudes
153280	159580	was a letter, in other words an opinion piece, not a scientific article. This is the study
159580	165400	he's referring to, and his claim that it's just an opinion piece is inaccurate and very
165400	172240	misleading. Firstly, it's listed as an article in the correspondence section of Nature Medicine.
172240	176880	A correspondence article is certainly less than a peer-reviewed paper, but it's more
176880	181720	than just an opinion piece, unless you consider inferences in science to be nothing more than
181720	188560	opinions. The correspondence section of Nature Medicine is a forum for professional researchers,
188560	193800	and articles published there still have to adhere to scientific principles. The scientific
193800	199280	evidence, methodology and inferences presented in correspondence articles can be responded
199280	205680	to corrected, confirmed or disproved, just like any other published study. Far from being
205680	211320	disproved or corrected, the article, authored by senior virology researchers from the Scripps
211320	216520	Institute, Tulane University, the University of Sydney, the University of Edinburgh and
216520	223600	Columbia University, has been cited by over 3,000 scientific studies. Wade goes on to
223600	229080	say, the discussion part of the letter begins, it is improbable that SARS-CoV-2 emerged through
229080	236280	laboratory manipulation of a related SARS-CoV-like coronavirus. But wait, didn't the lead say
236280	243320	the virus had clearly not been manipulated? Actually, no, it didn't say that at all. What
243320	249960	it said was, our analyses clearly show that SARS-CoV-2 is not a laboratory construct,
249960	256800	or a purposefully manipulated virus. If you think what Wade says means the same thing
256800	262920	as what the authors said, why did he need to change it? As I explained in my video,
262920	268280	The Scientific Method Made Easy, the word show in a scientific paper means something
268280	273960	has been demonstrated scientifically. Taking that word out completely changed this from
273960	280440	a scientific inference based on the evidence provided into an opinion based on dogma. When
280440	285800	the correct wording is put back, there's nothing contradictory in these two terms at
285800	291600	all. For example, the fossil and stratigraphical evidence clearly shows that animals evolved
291600	297540	over billions of years. The reason this is called the theory of evolution is that science
297540	302220	can never rule out the possibility that they were placed there by aliens or popped into
302220	307560	existence at the whim of a deity, who cleverly arranged things to look as though animals
307560	314220	had evolved over time. It's just that such an event is improbable.
314220	318920	As far as substance goes, Wade criticises two claims made by the authors of the Nature
318920	325320	Medicine article. Wade says, first they say the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 binds very
325320	330680	well to its target, the human ACE2 receptor, but does so in a different way from that which
330680	336640	physical calculations suggest would be the best fit. Therefore, the virus must have arisen
336640	342760	by natural selection, not manipulation. If that's all the authors had said, then
342760	348240	Wade could be forgiven for thinking the inference doesn't match the evidence. In fact, what
348240	355020	the authors show is a lot stronger and more detailed than just that one short sentence.
355020	360140	Another part of the virus spike protein that binds to the ACE2 receptor in a human cell
360140	365740	is called the receptor binding domain, the RBD. The Nature Medicine article explains
365740	372840	that five of the amino acids that make up the RBD aren't found in other SARS-CoV viruses.
372840	378060	So that's one piece of strong evidence against manipulation. When researchers are trying
378060	383740	to see how close a natural zoonotic virus is to becoming infectious, they want to make
383740	389700	as few changes as possible to just get it to that point. There'd be no point in spending
389700	394340	time and effort replacing five out of the six amino acids.
394340	398420	The other strong piece of evidence is that these radical changes wouldn't be expected
398420	405160	to work anyway. Researchers always run calculations first to see what effect any change might
405160	410640	have. They don't do things willy-nilly by trial and error, that would just be wasting
410640	415960	their time. The Nature Medicine authors discovered that computation analyses predict that the
415960	422520	interaction is not ideal. In other words, those changes are unlikely to work.
422520	427360	So again, no point in doing them. Because while lab researchers wouldn't waste their
427360	432720	time coming up with weird and inefficient structures that are unlikely to work, nature
432720	438480	does it all the time. Because it works not by calculation, but through a process of trial
438480	442620	and error. So there's a lot more evidence than Wade's
442620	448860	simplistic summation. A good example of how evolution comes out with odd and counterintuitive
448860	455540	designs is easier to see in this example. This hand has wrist bones for swivelling and
455540	461000	an intricate array of knuckles, fingers and a thumb, perfect for grasping branches, picking
461000	466680	up food and fashioning tools. It looks like an example of something intelligently designed
466680	472920	for its purpose. Except it's not a hand, it's a remnant of evolution inside a dolphin's
472920	477820	flipper. An intelligent designer wouldn't have bothered spending time and effort coming
477820	483760	up with a pointless and intricate system of wrist bones, knuckles, fingers and thumbs,
483760	489480	or if you prefer, ankles, tarsals, metatarsals and toes, to put them inside a flipper where
489480	495120	they can't be used. But the hit and miss approach of evolution throws up all kinds of oddities
495120	502400	like this all the time, not only in the animal world, but in the world of viruses too.
502400	508600	So Wade is firstly misquoting and then completely misrepresenting the author's evidence and
508600	514400	their conclusion. The problem is that most people don't read the study, they just read
514400	521640	Wade's summary of what he claims the study says. Wade goes on to say, the author's basic
521640	527160	assumption, not spelled out, is that anyone trying to make a bat virus bind to human cells
527160	533080	could do so in only one way. First they would calculate the strongest possible fit between
533080	538680	the human ACE2 receptor and the spike protein with which the virus latches onto it. Then
538680	543440	they would design the spike protein. But the reason that's not spelled out is because that's
543440	548460	not the author's assumption. It's Wade's assumption that that's how virus research
548460	554940	is done. The authors know better because they're virology researchers themselves.
554940	559420	Researchers in this field are not looking for the strongest possible fit. As I explained
559420	564740	earlier, they're trying to determine how close a natural virus is to infecting humans, a
564740	569300	transition known as spillover. So they're looking for the minimal number of changes
569300	576100	needed for a possible fit. Wade then tells the virology researchers, again, how he thinks
576100	582200	they do their job. And again, he gets it wrong. This ignores the way that virologists do,
582200	587700	in fact, get spike proteins to bind to chosen targets, which is not by calculation, but
587700	594260	by splicing in spike protein genes from other viruses or by serial passage.
594260	598480	The authors aren't ignoring Wade's imagined account of how they do their research. They
598480	603780	happen to know that researchers in this field do make their calculations first, and then
603780	609600	they get the spike proteins to bind to chosen targets based on those calculations. How many
609600	614200	of the people who were convinced by Wade's essay actually bothered to check the Nature
614200	619940	Medicine article to see if it says what Wade claims it says.
619940	624900	Wade's next argument against the Nature Medicine article concerns the nature of the virus backbone,
624900	630800	which I covered in my first video on the origin of SARS-CoV-2. I said this. When researchers
630800	636140	are bioengineering a virus, they usually don't build the entire thing from scratch.
636140	641180	What they're interested in is the business end of the virus, called the spike proteins.
641180	646520	They house the receptor binding domain, the RBD, where the virus attaches itself to the
646520	652980	host cell, and the cleavage sites, where it breaks in and enters the cell. So, except
652980	658260	in exceptional circumstances, they build the spike proteins onto the structure of an existing
658260	664680	infectious virus. I suppose the best analogy is graffiti artists. They usually don't
664680	669880	spend lots of time and money building an entire wall from scratch in order to spray paint
669880	673960	their art. They find an existing wall and use that.
673960	679120	Wade doesn't dispute the fact that virologists use existing backbones in their research or
679120	684560	that the SARS-CoV-2 backbone is novel, but he argues that researchers might have built
684560	692380	it themselves because, he says, backbones are quite easy to make. So it's possible.
692380	697860	Since he doesn't quantify how easy it is, we need to check his source and find out.
697860	705240	Unfortunately, as so often in his essay, he doesn't give a source, it's just his assumption.
705240	710740	Since Wade has no expertise in this field, we need to find out from a real research virologist
710740	715980	how easy it is to make a novel backbone. A couple of researchers I spoke to thought
715980	721300	it would take years, and when I did a search online, I found that the Ben Hur-Lee lab,
721300	727520	which does research in this field, says making a new backbone takes months or even years.
727520	733020	Robert Gary, a professor of microbiology and immunology at Tulane University and one of
733020	738420	the authors of the Nature Medicine study, didn't even think it was possible. He told
738420	743900	Business Insider, people just don't know enough about what makes a virus pathogenic
743900	751140	to be able to assemble that. So quite easy varies from a few months to impossible. But
751140	757120	even if we take the lowest estimate of a few months, why would any researcher bother? After
757120	762140	all, researchers are trying to see how close a virus is to spill over, and that's why all
762140	768160	their research is focused on this, the spike protein, the infectious part of the virus.
768160	772960	They don't need to spend time, effort and money trying to build a completely new backbone,
772960	779240	and Wade doesn't explain why they would, except he assumes it's quite easy.
779240	784640	Using the analogy, when most of us see something like this, we'd say it clearly shows that
784640	789440	someone spray painted a rock. We wouldn't seriously entertain the idea that someone
789440	795240	took time, effort and money to buy a lot of gravel melted in a furnace to make the rock
795240	800540	and then go to even greater efforts to make the rock look perfectly natural. I think we'd
800540	807180	all agree that such a pointless and time consuming exercise is improbable. The more obvious and
807180	813080	simple explanation is that someone's just spray painted a rock. It's a principle known
813080	819640	as Occam's Razor. Wade closes the section on the Nature Science paper by saying, and
819640	824620	that's it. These are the two arguments made by the Anderson group in support of their
824620	829420	declaration that the SARS-2 virus was clearly not manipulated.
829420	835220	Well, that's not quite it. First of all, this wasn't a declaration, it was an inference
835220	841600	based on the evidence that Wade mostly misrepresented. Secondly, there was a lot more in the study
841600	847060	than just two arguments, and certainly a lot that's very different to Wade's two line
847060	854180	misquotes. He continues, and this conclusion, grounded in nothing but two inconclusive speculations,
854420	859860	convinced the world's press that SARS-2 could not have escaped from a lab. Again, they certainly
859860	866500	weren't inconclusive speculations. They were very detailed and very conclusive. But you
866500	871580	wouldn't know that if all you read was Wade's inaccurate summation.
871580	876060	It isn't the world's press that was convinced by the Nature Medicine Study. It's unlikely
876060	881340	most journalists read it. It was thousands of virology researchers who cited it in their
881340	886740	own research papers, like these ones. They were convinced because they're professional
886740	893100	researchers who didn't see these scientific inferences as inconclusive speculations. They
893100	898100	did read the study and they did understand it. That's why they cited it.
898100	902340	So we'll move on to the second poster who asked me to fact check Wade's essay. He
902340	906820	wrote, I think the most important part to address there would be where he talks about
906820	912660	the seamless method of genome manipulation. Here's the part of Wade's essay being referred
912660	919100	to. Wade says, Unfortunately, this was another case of poor science, in the sense defined
919100	924660	above. True, some older methods of cutting and pasting viral genomes retain telltale
924660	930740	signs of manipulation, but newer methods, called noceum or seamless approaches, leave
930740	935640	no defining marks. But the authors aren't arguing that cutting
935640	941880	and pasting viral genomes retains telltale signs of manipulation, or that it represents
941880	948120	any kind of evidence that SARS-CoV-2 is natural. This seems to be an argument Wade has invented
948120	954800	himself, just so he can knock it down, which he then proceeds to do. He says, But newer
954800	960760	methods, called noceum or seamless approaches, leave no defining marks, nor do other methods
960760	965600	for manipulating viruses, such as serial passage, the repeated transfer of viruses
965600	970560	from one culture of cells to another. If a virus has been manipulated, whether with a
970560	976380	seamless method or by serial passage, there's no way of knowing that this is the case. Anderson
976380	982120	and his colleagues were assuring their readers of something they could not know. But Anderson
982120	986460	and his colleagues weren't trying to assure readers of anything of the sort. They never
986460	990400	even mentioned it. No one's trying to argue that there might
990400	996180	or might not be telltale signs of manipulation. It's irrelevant. It's the fact that these
996180	1002580	features are there at all, which shows a natural evolutionary path. The noceum technique is
1002580	1007500	a method of gene insertion used in cloning. It doesn't mean we can't see these new
1007500	1012600	genetic sequences, so it doesn't affect the evidence at all.
1012600	1016880	Going back to the example of a hand inside a dolphin's flipper, I'm equally happy
1016880	1021480	to accept a creationist's argument that any intelligent designer could have done
1021480	1028000	this without leaving any incriminating toolmarks. But that's not the point. It's the fact
1028000	1033220	that all these hand bones are in there that argues against intelligent design, because
1033220	1038000	an intelligent designer wouldn't have bothered with all these pointless and complex design
1038000	1043440	features. And we can see transitions for some of these changes, just as we can see
1043440	1050740	the pathway to many of the odd and counter-intuitive features of SARS-CoV-2 in other viruses.
1050740	1055600	On to the next argument in Wade's essay that someone said is the most convincing.
1055600	1061960	The poster C-Panic gave this example, so again, this is his choice, not my cherry pick. Look
1061960	1068640	at this section. This is the grant from NIH. C-Panic then quoted part of a National Institute
1068640	1073880	of Health grant document addressed to the Wuhan Institute of Virology, which has a brief
1073880	1080800	laying out what its funding is to be used for. C-Panic then explained. What this means,
1080800	1084400	in non-technical language, he said, is that she set out to create…
1084400	1089940	But wait a minute. This is just a huge chunk of text lifted directly from Wade's essay.
1089940	1095660	This is what Wade thinks it means. So how do we know he's understood it, or that he's
1095660	1099980	explaining it accurately? The good news is that Wade gives a source
1099980	1106340	for his claims, which means it can be easily checked. This is the NIH funding brief he's
1106340	1112000	referring to, and he even quotes the section of the document he's referring to. Wade
1112000	1117740	claims it instructs Dr Shee, the researcher, to create novel coronaviruses with the highest
1117740	1124100	possible infectivity for human cells, which, if true, would be an incredibly reckless and
1124100	1130180	dangerous thing for any lab to do. Making the most infectious virus possible is the
1130180	1135120	recipe for a terror weapon. And even if you believe that there was a conspiracy to make
1135120	1141340	such a weapon, it would be a bit odd for the United States to fund such research in China,
1141340	1146100	and odder still that it would be spelled out in a publicly available document.
1146100	1151260	So wherever else you think this conspiracy is being played out, it's certainly not in
1151260	1155620	the document Wade's citing, or in the passage he cites.
1155620	1160840	As I mentioned earlier, the spillover potential of a naturally occurring virus means the potential
1160840	1166840	of the virus to mutate into a form that can infect humans. So researchers need to identify
1166840	1173060	which of the many viruses found in nature is closest to this point. In other words,
1173060	1178320	the idea is to make as few changes as possible to the spike protein just to get to the point
1178320	1184520	where spillover will occur, not to make the most infectious virus. The reason for doing
1184520	1189640	this is it helps predict which of the viruses in nature is closest to becoming infectious
1189640	1193920	to humans. Wade compounds his error by adding,
1193920	1198480	The methodical approach was designed to find the best combination of coronavirus backbone
1198480	1205140	and spike protein for infecting human cells. I found it very hard to believe the NIH brief
1205140	1210620	said this, because it's funding research into the infectivity of the virus, which doesn't
1210620	1216820	come from the backbone, it comes from the spike protein. As we've seen, for experimentation
1216820	1222820	purposes researchers simply pick a backbone off the shelf. And when I searched for anything
1222820	1229280	resembling this claim in Wade's source, I couldn't find it and Wade doesn't quote it.
1229280	1234680	So that's the problem with believing Wade on the basis that he sounds credible or assuming
1234680	1240700	he has a good track record as a science journalist. So those were supposedly the most convincing
1240700	1246160	pieces of scientific evidence in Wade's essay, not picked by me but by people on the
1246160	1251720	forum who responded when asked. Of course, now that this has been addressed, I have no
1251720	1257000	doubt it'll be answered with the what about arguments. What about the rest of Wade's essay?
1257000	1263520	What about this blog or that video? What about something else? All I can say is, guys, even
1263520	1268980	if I had time to make a hundred videos a year in order to whack down every new misunderstanding
1268980	1274020	and misquote that pops up on the internet, you don't need me to fact check this stuff
1274020	1280340	anyway. You can fact check it yourself. Wade asks why virologists don't make the
1280340	1286640	same claims he's making. It can't be because he's wrong. It must be because researchers
1286640	1292280	are all corrupt. As with climate change, evolution and every other scientific conclusion that
1292280	1297400	people don't want to believe, they use the standard fallback position that scientists
1297400	1303020	don't risk having their next grant application turned down. I've covered this default excuse
1303020	1308320	in several videos. If the research conflicts with your belief, it can't be because you're
1308320	1314200	wrong. The research must be wrong, and therefore all the researchers must be corrupt. The simple
1314200	1318960	fact of the matter is that other virologists don't contradict the published science because
1318960	1322380	they've ascertained that the published science is correct.
1322380	1327560	Finally, if you're seeing ads on this video, it's because I've now monetised the channel
1327560	1333140	and have made Health in Harmony the beneficiary of the income. Health in Harmony is the charity
1333140	1337920	that I've been asking people to support if they want to support this channel, so if you
1337920	1342260	want to find out more about it, take a look at the links in the video description. And
1342260	1347000	for those who've donated in the past, thanks very much for doing so, and I hope many of
1347000	1352680	you will continue to donate in the future, even though we now have advertisements running.
1352680	1357560	If you're not seeing ads on this video, then that's due to my pathetic technology skills.
