1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,880
All the way from Canada, professor and science researcher Ian Juby.

2
00:00:05,880 --> 00:00:09,760
Professor? Yes, this is just plain old Ian Juby,

3
00:00:09,760 --> 00:00:13,560
but I have no idea why he's suddenly risen through the ranks of academia.

4
00:00:13,560 --> 00:00:18,000
Some of you may remember him as the former coveted Golden Crocoduck nominee

5
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:19,720
who went postal in a rowing boat.

6
00:00:19,720 --> 00:00:22,720
Over your lifetime you'll accumulate a few errors of your DNA.

7
00:00:22,720 --> 00:00:25,600
Yeah, he's got a gun!

8
00:00:25,600 --> 00:00:29,360
Juby is back once again, taking another shot at the coveted award.

9
00:00:29,680 --> 00:00:35,000
Someone nominated this video, which has Juby talking to Karl Bau about dinosaur eggs.

10
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:38,480
This is a replica of an oviraptor egg nest.

11
00:00:38,480 --> 00:00:41,000
This is what the dinosaurs want to do.

12
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:45,120
Yes, all right, well stated, well stated.

13
00:00:45,120 --> 00:00:47,720
What do we actually find in the fossil record?

14
00:00:47,720 --> 00:00:51,480
We find a number of very radical things.

15
00:00:51,480 --> 00:00:55,360
For example, this comes from the two medicine formation in Montana.

16
00:00:55,400 --> 00:00:59,400
Again, a replica, it was in green-grey mudstone.

17
00:00:59,400 --> 00:01:03,400
And again, apparently this dinosaur laid them in twos,

18
00:01:03,400 --> 00:01:06,560
but apparently laid the eggs on the run.

19
00:01:06,560 --> 00:01:09,400
Ian, that's incredible!

20
00:01:09,400 --> 00:01:13,280
It sure is, because incredible means unbelievable,

21
00:01:13,280 --> 00:01:15,080
and I don't believe it for a minute.

22
00:01:15,080 --> 00:01:21,480
In what spiritually induced hallucination did a dinosaur on the run lay eggs in neat rows like this?

23
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:26,920
Juby goes on to conclude, of course, that this is evidence of the biblical flood.

24
00:01:26,920 --> 00:01:30,520
To test his hypothesis, I decided to devise an experiment

25
00:01:30,520 --> 00:01:35,640
to see what might happen when dinosaurs lay eggs while running for their lives.

26
00:01:35,640 --> 00:01:37,920
Of course, there are no dinosaurs around today,

27
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:42,680
but chickens are descended from small running dinosaurs and mimic them rather well.

28
00:01:42,680 --> 00:01:46,600
So I decided to scare some chickens just as they were about to lay their eggs

29
00:01:46,600 --> 00:01:50,120
by emptying a tank of water to imitate the global flood.

30
00:01:50,160 --> 00:01:54,640
Now, when I started this experiment, I did expect it to fail spectacularly,

31
00:01:54,640 --> 00:01:57,360
but what actually happened astonished me.

32
00:01:57,360 --> 00:02:00,360
Now, it's not often a creationist gets something right,

33
00:02:00,360 --> 00:02:05,160
but I must admit that the experiment clearly supports Juby's hypothesis.

34
00:02:05,160 --> 00:02:06,160
Let's roll the tape.

35
00:02:20,120 --> 00:02:22,120
Ian, that's incredible!

36
00:02:34,680 --> 00:02:36,680
Ian, that's incredible!

37
00:02:44,560 --> 00:02:48,640
The stunning result was that the chickens not only laid their eggs on the run,

38
00:02:48,640 --> 00:02:52,840
but when the eggs were examined later, it turned out they'd formed into neat rows,

39
00:02:52,840 --> 00:02:55,440
just as Ian Juby had predicted.

40
00:02:55,440 --> 00:02:57,920
Not only that, one of them was made of chocolate.

41
00:02:57,920 --> 00:02:59,160
That's incredible!

42
00:02:59,160 --> 00:03:02,360
Of course it is, Carl! I'm pulling your plonker!

43
00:03:02,360 --> 00:03:04,880
There was no experiment, no neat rows,

44
00:03:04,880 --> 00:03:07,800
and chickens don't lay chocolate bloody Easter eggs.

45
00:03:07,800 --> 00:03:11,160
If Juby thinks this is anywhere within the realm of sanity,

46
00:03:11,160 --> 00:03:15,440
let him do this experiment and show the result I got in my fake one.

47
00:03:15,440 --> 00:03:18,160
That's what real professors do.

48
00:03:18,160 --> 00:03:22,880
But Juby isn't eligible for the coveted Golden Crocoduck because of a stupid idea.

49
00:03:22,880 --> 00:03:25,520
He has to actually breach the Ninth Commandment,

50
00:03:25,520 --> 00:03:30,640
and of course he couldn't pull off this silly egg-laying hunch without doing that.

51
00:03:30,640 --> 00:03:33,480
Juby starts off by showing us an oviraptor nest

52
00:03:33,480 --> 00:03:37,520
and saying that oviraptors like to lay their eggs in a circular fashion.

53
00:03:37,520 --> 00:03:40,600
Yes, that's what paleontologists have discovered.

54
00:03:40,600 --> 00:03:44,120
Then he claims another set of eggs should have been laid in the same way

55
00:03:44,120 --> 00:03:47,520
because they were laid by the same type of dinosaur.

56
00:03:47,920 --> 00:03:49,320
But they weren't.

57
00:03:49,320 --> 00:03:53,920
As always, to get to the bottom of this mendacity, we have to check Juby's sources.

58
00:03:53,920 --> 00:03:58,160
A lot of this is centralized around an article by Barnhart

59
00:03:58,160 --> 00:04:01,120
in the Creation Research Society Quarterly magazine.

60
00:04:01,120 --> 00:04:05,920
He did an excellent article, multiple pages, examining dinosaur egg nests.

61
00:04:05,920 --> 00:04:10,560
But Barnhart doesn't say the elongated nests were made by an oviraptor at all.

62
00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:14,400
He cites a 1994 book containing a chapter by Moratella,

63
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:18,960
who in turn cites a 1987 paper by Horner, who described these eggs,

64
00:04:18,960 --> 00:04:25,720
and all three attribute the elongated nest to a different type of dinosaur, the Troodon.

65
00:04:25,720 --> 00:04:28,560
This isn't just a minor issue of classification.

66
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:31,360
These are two completely different dinosaurs.

67
00:04:31,360 --> 00:04:36,360
The Troodon nest is from Montana, but the oviraptor nest comes from Mongolia.

68
00:04:36,360 --> 00:04:40,400
The two species lived on completely opposite sides of the world.

69
00:04:40,400 --> 00:04:44,000
So not only is Ian Juby's idea completely idiotic,

70
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:47,800
it's not even based on a proper reading of his sources.

71
00:04:47,800 --> 00:04:52,000
A real professor would have had the ability to read and understand all this.

72
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,400
But of course Juby isn't a professor.

73
00:04:54,400 --> 00:04:58,920
He's called that because there's a dearth of scientifically qualified creationists,

74
00:04:58,920 --> 00:05:01,720
so they like to create titles for themselves.

75
00:05:01,720 --> 00:05:06,560
And if anyone is suspicious of Juby's fake qualifications, Juby has a backup.

76
00:05:06,560 --> 00:05:12,320
And this audience should know that your IQ is off the chart, and we appreciate that.

77
00:05:12,320 --> 00:05:15,560
Yes, he may not be qualified, but he's smarter than you,

78
00:05:15,560 --> 00:05:19,320
which means he knows a lot more about dinosaurs running away from a global flood

79
00:05:19,320 --> 00:05:23,600
and laying eggs in two neat rows than you do. So there.

80
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:25,680
Ian, this isn't personal, mate.

81
00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:28,920
You're a very nice chap with a wonderful sense of humour.

82
00:05:28,920 --> 00:05:32,160
But if you want to preach what you believe to be the truth,

83
00:05:32,160 --> 00:05:35,800
why do you have to change the facts in order to do it?

84
00:05:35,800 --> 00:05:40,000
Well, I guess if you didn't change the name of the dinosaur given in the scientific literature,

85
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:45,640
then there'd be no puzzle and no need to invent even the most tenuous link to a global flood.

86
00:05:45,640 --> 00:05:50,520
People would think your eggs on the run story was just chicken poop and laugh at it.

87
00:05:50,520 --> 00:05:52,160
I'd hate to see that happen.
