00:00.000 --> 00:05.880
All the way from Canada, professor and science researcher Ian Juby.

00:05.880 --> 00:09.760
Professor? Yes, this is just plain old Ian Juby,

00:09.760 --> 00:13.560
but I have no idea why he's suddenly risen through the ranks of academia.

00:13.560 --> 00:18.000
Some of you may remember him as the former coveted Golden Crocoduck nominee

00:18.000 --> 00:19.720
who went postal in a rowing boat.

00:19.720 --> 00:22.720
Over your lifetime you'll accumulate a few errors of your DNA.

00:22.720 --> 00:25.600
Yeah, he's got a gun!

00:25.600 --> 00:29.360
Juby is back once again, taking another shot at the coveted award.

00:29.680 --> 00:35.000
Someone nominated this video, which has Juby talking to Karl Bau about dinosaur eggs.

00:35.000 --> 00:38.480
This is a replica of an oviraptor egg nest.

00:38.480 --> 00:41.000
This is what the dinosaurs want to do.

00:41.000 --> 00:45.120
Yes, all right, well stated, well stated.

00:45.120 --> 00:47.720
What do we actually find in the fossil record?

00:47.720 --> 00:51.480
We find a number of very radical things.

00:51.480 --> 00:55.360
For example, this comes from the two medicine formation in Montana.

00:55.400 --> 00:59.400
Again, a replica, it was in green-grey mudstone.

00:59.400 --> 01:03.400
And again, apparently this dinosaur laid them in twos,

01:03.400 --> 01:06.560
but apparently laid the eggs on the run.

01:06.560 --> 01:09.400
Ian, that's incredible!

01:09.400 --> 01:13.280
It sure is, because incredible means unbelievable,

01:13.280 --> 01:15.080
and I don't believe it for a minute.

01:15.080 --> 01:21.480
In what spiritually induced hallucination did a dinosaur on the run lay eggs in neat rows like this?

01:21.920 --> 01:26.920
Juby goes on to conclude, of course, that this is evidence of the biblical flood.

01:26.920 --> 01:30.520
To test his hypothesis, I decided to devise an experiment

01:30.520 --> 01:35.640
to see what might happen when dinosaurs lay eggs while running for their lives.

01:35.640 --> 01:37.920
Of course, there are no dinosaurs around today,

01:37.920 --> 01:42.680
but chickens are descended from small running dinosaurs and mimic them rather well.

01:42.680 --> 01:46.600
So I decided to scare some chickens just as they were about to lay their eggs

01:46.600 --> 01:50.120
by emptying a tank of water to imitate the global flood.

01:50.160 --> 01:54.640
Now, when I started this experiment, I did expect it to fail spectacularly,

01:54.640 --> 01:57.360
but what actually happened astonished me.

01:57.360 --> 02:00.360
Now, it's not often a creationist gets something right,

02:00.360 --> 02:05.160
but I must admit that the experiment clearly supports Juby's hypothesis.

02:05.160 --> 02:06.160
Let's roll the tape.

02:20.120 --> 02:22.120
Ian, that's incredible!

02:34.680 --> 02:36.680
Ian, that's incredible!

02:44.560 --> 02:48.640
The stunning result was that the chickens not only laid their eggs on the run,

02:48.640 --> 02:52.840
but when the eggs were examined later, it turned out they'd formed into neat rows,

02:52.840 --> 02:55.440
just as Ian Juby had predicted.

02:55.440 --> 02:57.920
Not only that, one of them was made of chocolate.

02:57.920 --> 02:59.160
That's incredible!

02:59.160 --> 03:02.360
Of course it is, Carl! I'm pulling your plonker!

03:02.360 --> 03:04.880
There was no experiment, no neat rows,

03:04.880 --> 03:07.800
and chickens don't lay chocolate bloody Easter eggs.

03:07.800 --> 03:11.160
If Juby thinks this is anywhere within the realm of sanity,

03:11.160 --> 03:15.440
let him do this experiment and show the result I got in my fake one.

03:15.440 --> 03:18.160
That's what real professors do.

03:18.160 --> 03:22.880
But Juby isn't eligible for the coveted Golden Crocoduck because of a stupid idea.

03:22.880 --> 03:25.520
He has to actually breach the Ninth Commandment,

03:25.520 --> 03:30.640
and of course he couldn't pull off this silly egg-laying hunch without doing that.

03:30.640 --> 03:33.480
Juby starts off by showing us an oviraptor nest

03:33.480 --> 03:37.520
and saying that oviraptors like to lay their eggs in a circular fashion.

03:37.520 --> 03:40.600
Yes, that's what paleontologists have discovered.

03:40.600 --> 03:44.120
Then he claims another set of eggs should have been laid in the same way

03:44.120 --> 03:47.520
because they were laid by the same type of dinosaur.

03:47.920 --> 03:49.320
But they weren't.

03:49.320 --> 03:53.920
As always, to get to the bottom of this mendacity, we have to check Juby's sources.

03:53.920 --> 03:58.160
A lot of this is centralized around an article by Barnhart

03:58.160 --> 04:01.120
in the Creation Research Society Quarterly magazine.

04:01.120 --> 04:05.920
He did an excellent article, multiple pages, examining dinosaur egg nests.

04:05.920 --> 04:10.560
But Barnhart doesn't say the elongated nests were made by an oviraptor at all.

04:10.560 --> 04:14.400
He cites a 1994 book containing a chapter by Moratella,

04:14.400 --> 04:18.960
who in turn cites a 1987 paper by Horner, who described these eggs,

04:18.960 --> 04:25.720
and all three attribute the elongated nest to a different type of dinosaur, the Troodon.

04:25.720 --> 04:28.560
This isn't just a minor issue of classification.

04:28.560 --> 04:31.360
These are two completely different dinosaurs.

04:31.360 --> 04:36.360
The Troodon nest is from Montana, but the oviraptor nest comes from Mongolia.

04:36.360 --> 04:40.400
The two species lived on completely opposite sides of the world.

04:40.400 --> 04:44.000
So not only is Ian Juby's idea completely idiotic,

04:44.000 --> 04:47.800
it's not even based on a proper reading of his sources.

04:47.800 --> 04:52.000
A real professor would have had the ability to read and understand all this.

04:52.000 --> 04:54.400
But of course Juby isn't a professor.

04:54.400 --> 04:58.920
He's called that because there's a dearth of scientifically qualified creationists,

04:58.920 --> 05:01.720
so they like to create titles for themselves.

05:01.720 --> 05:06.560
And if anyone is suspicious of Juby's fake qualifications, Juby has a backup.

05:06.560 --> 05:12.320
And this audience should know that your IQ is off the chart, and we appreciate that.

05:12.320 --> 05:15.560
Yes, he may not be qualified, but he's smarter than you,

05:15.560 --> 05:19.320
which means he knows a lot more about dinosaurs running away from a global flood

05:19.320 --> 05:23.600
and laying eggs in two neat rows than you do. So there.

05:23.600 --> 05:25.680
Ian, this isn't personal, mate.

05:25.680 --> 05:28.920
You're a very nice chap with a wonderful sense of humour.

05:28.920 --> 05:32.160
But if you want to preach what you believe to be the truth,

05:32.160 --> 05:35.800
why do you have to change the facts in order to do it?

05:35.800 --> 05:40.000
Well, I guess if you didn't change the name of the dinosaur given in the scientific literature,

05:40.000 --> 05:45.640
then there'd be no puzzle and no need to invent even the most tenuous link to a global flood.

05:45.640 --> 05:50.520
People would think your eggs on the run story was just chicken poop and laugh at it.

05:50.520 --> 05:52.160
I'd hate to see that happen.
