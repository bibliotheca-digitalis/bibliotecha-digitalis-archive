0	5880	All the way from Canada, professor and science researcher Ian Juby.
5880	9760	Professor? Yes, this is just plain old Ian Juby,
9760	13560	but I have no idea why he's suddenly risen through the ranks of academia.
13560	18000	Some of you may remember him as the former coveted Golden Crocoduck nominee
18000	19720	who went postal in a rowing boat.
19720	22720	Over your lifetime you'll accumulate a few errors of your DNA.
22720	25600	Yeah, he's got a gun!
25600	29360	Juby is back once again, taking another shot at the coveted award.
29680	35000	Someone nominated this video, which has Juby talking to Karl Bau about dinosaur eggs.
35000	38480	This is a replica of an oviraptor egg nest.
38480	41000	This is what the dinosaurs want to do.
41000	45120	Yes, all right, well stated, well stated.
45120	47720	What do we actually find in the fossil record?
47720	51480	We find a number of very radical things.
51480	55360	For example, this comes from the two medicine formation in Montana.
55400	59400	Again, a replica, it was in green-grey mudstone.
59400	63400	And again, apparently this dinosaur laid them in twos,
63400	66560	but apparently laid the eggs on the run.
66560	69400	Ian, that's incredible!
69400	73280	It sure is, because incredible means unbelievable,
73280	75080	and I don't believe it for a minute.
75080	81480	In what spiritually induced hallucination did a dinosaur on the run lay eggs in neat rows like this?
81920	86920	Juby goes on to conclude, of course, that this is evidence of the biblical flood.
86920	90520	To test his hypothesis, I decided to devise an experiment
90520	95640	to see what might happen when dinosaurs lay eggs while running for their lives.
95640	97920	Of course, there are no dinosaurs around today,
97920	102680	but chickens are descended from small running dinosaurs and mimic them rather well.
102680	106600	So I decided to scare some chickens just as they were about to lay their eggs
106600	110120	by emptying a tank of water to imitate the global flood.
110160	114640	Now, when I started this experiment, I did expect it to fail spectacularly,
114640	117360	but what actually happened astonished me.
117360	120360	Now, it's not often a creationist gets something right,
120360	125160	but I must admit that the experiment clearly supports Juby's hypothesis.
125160	126160	Let's roll the tape.
140120	142120	Ian, that's incredible!
154680	156680	Ian, that's incredible!
164560	168640	The stunning result was that the chickens not only laid their eggs on the run,
168640	172840	but when the eggs were examined later, it turned out they'd formed into neat rows,
172840	175440	just as Ian Juby had predicted.
175440	177920	Not only that, one of them was made of chocolate.
177920	179160	That's incredible!
179160	182360	Of course it is, Carl! I'm pulling your plonker!
182360	184880	There was no experiment, no neat rows,
184880	187800	and chickens don't lay chocolate bloody Easter eggs.
187800	191160	If Juby thinks this is anywhere within the realm of sanity,
191160	195440	let him do this experiment and show the result I got in my fake one.
195440	198160	That's what real professors do.
198160	202880	But Juby isn't eligible for the coveted Golden Crocoduck because of a stupid idea.
202880	205520	He has to actually breach the Ninth Commandment,
205520	210640	and of course he couldn't pull off this silly egg-laying hunch without doing that.
210640	213480	Juby starts off by showing us an oviraptor nest
213480	217520	and saying that oviraptors like to lay their eggs in a circular fashion.
217520	220600	Yes, that's what paleontologists have discovered.
220600	224120	Then he claims another set of eggs should have been laid in the same way
224120	227520	because they were laid by the same type of dinosaur.
227920	229320	But they weren't.
229320	233920	As always, to get to the bottom of this mendacity, we have to check Juby's sources.
233920	238160	A lot of this is centralized around an article by Barnhart
238160	241120	in the Creation Research Society Quarterly magazine.
241120	245920	He did an excellent article, multiple pages, examining dinosaur egg nests.
245920	250560	But Barnhart doesn't say the elongated nests were made by an oviraptor at all.
250560	254400	He cites a 1994 book containing a chapter by Moratella,
254400	258960	who in turn cites a 1987 paper by Horner, who described these eggs,
258960	265720	and all three attribute the elongated nest to a different type of dinosaur, the Troodon.
265720	268560	This isn't just a minor issue of classification.
268560	271360	These are two completely different dinosaurs.
271360	276360	The Troodon nest is from Montana, but the oviraptor nest comes from Mongolia.
276360	280400	The two species lived on completely opposite sides of the world.
280400	284000	So not only is Ian Juby's idea completely idiotic,
284000	287800	it's not even based on a proper reading of his sources.
287800	292000	A real professor would have had the ability to read and understand all this.
292000	294400	But of course Juby isn't a professor.
294400	298920	He's called that because there's a dearth of scientifically qualified creationists,
298920	301720	so they like to create titles for themselves.
301720	306560	And if anyone is suspicious of Juby's fake qualifications, Juby has a backup.
306560	312320	And this audience should know that your IQ is off the chart, and we appreciate that.
312320	315560	Yes, he may not be qualified, but he's smarter than you,
315560	319320	which means he knows a lot more about dinosaurs running away from a global flood
319320	323600	and laying eggs in two neat rows than you do. So there.
323600	325680	Ian, this isn't personal, mate.
325680	328920	You're a very nice chap with a wonderful sense of humour.
328920	332160	But if you want to preach what you believe to be the truth,
332160	335800	why do you have to change the facts in order to do it?
335800	340000	Well, I guess if you didn't change the name of the dinosaur given in the scientific literature,
340000	345640	then there'd be no puzzle and no need to invent even the most tenuous link to a global flood.
345640	350520	People would think your eggs on the run story was just chicken poop and laugh at it.
350520	352160	I'd hate to see that happen.
