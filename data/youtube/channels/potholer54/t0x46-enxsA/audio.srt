1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,900
Make no mistake, the tragedy unfolding in Australia is climate change based.

2
00:00:05,900 --> 00:00:10,380
Well perhaps that's a conclusion best left to the experts, rather than an acceptance

3
00:00:10,380 --> 00:00:12,580
speech at the Golden Globes.

4
00:00:12,580 --> 00:00:17,620
So let's hear the scientific conclusion from Australia's leading climate scientist.

5
00:00:17,620 --> 00:00:20,300
Climate change isn't the cause of these bushfires.

6
00:00:20,300 --> 00:00:25,520
Wait, my mistake, this isn't Australia's leading climate scientist, it's plain old TV commentator

7
00:00:25,520 --> 00:00:28,900
Peter Credlin, also not an expert.

8
00:00:29,160 --> 00:00:33,640
Aren't there any real researchers out there who can give us an expert conclusion?

9
00:00:33,640 --> 00:00:37,880
We seem to be inundated with pundits all over the world who've suddenly found Australia

10
00:00:37,880 --> 00:00:44,540
on a map and decided that after five minutes surfing the internet they know what's causing

11
00:00:44,540 --> 00:00:50,320
the bushfires and of course they think we're in dire need of their McExpert opinion.

12
00:00:50,320 --> 00:00:54,640
So let me start by saying that I'm no more of an expert than they are, so I'm not going

13
00:00:54,640 --> 00:00:58,640
to set myself up as one or make up my own theories.

14
00:00:58,640 --> 00:01:01,960
As always, I'm going to report the science.

15
00:01:01,960 --> 00:01:07,840
The real experts will tell you that the link between climate change and bushfires is complicated.

16
00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:11,460
But let's look at this through the eyes of the amateurs and take a closer look at what

17
00:01:11,460 --> 00:01:17,260
the science says in response, starting with the excuse that we're not seeing anything new.

18
00:01:17,260 --> 00:01:24,420
Nothing to see here, please, experts, nothing to see here, please.

19
00:01:24,420 --> 00:01:30,740
See that this nation, this state, has seen similar conditions and similar disasters many,

20
00:01:30,740 --> 00:01:32,360
many times over.

21
00:01:32,360 --> 00:01:36,540
The fact none of these bushfires were in any way extraordinary compared to not just the

22
00:01:36,540 --> 00:01:42,500
last 50 years but indeed the last 150 years was an inconvenient truth.

23
00:01:42,500 --> 00:01:46,800
Yes, apparently it's the normal climate of Australia.

24
00:01:46,800 --> 00:01:50,260
Not exactly a new phenomenon in Australia.

25
00:01:50,260 --> 00:01:55,140
And of course that's true, Australia has always had bushfires, droughts and heatwaves.

26
00:01:55,140 --> 00:01:59,900
I think you'd be hard-pressed to find a single scientific study that disagrees.

27
00:01:59,900 --> 00:02:04,460
But what climate researchers want to know, and I would have thought this was pretty obvious,

28
00:02:04,460 --> 00:02:09,020
is whether temperatures have been rising and whether the heatwaves, droughts and fires

29
00:02:09,020 --> 00:02:11,020
have been getting worse.

30
00:02:11,020 --> 00:02:15,900
One way to find out if it was hotter in the past is to go back over old newspaper clippings

31
00:02:15,900 --> 00:02:20,540
and see if you can find heatwaves or very hot days on different dates in different parts

32
00:02:20,540 --> 00:02:21,540
of the country.

33
00:02:21,540 --> 00:02:25,460
Now let's look at an Australian heatwave which occurred 80 years ago.

34
00:02:25,460 --> 00:02:29,500
They're easy to find, but of course they don't tell us much.

35
00:02:29,500 --> 00:02:35,100
Australia is a huge continent, so cherry-picking a record temperature in one particular town

36
00:02:35,100 --> 00:02:39,600
doesn't tell you what's happening in the rest of the country or the rest of that year, let

37
00:02:39,600 --> 00:02:42,140
alone over several decades.

38
00:02:42,140 --> 00:02:44,960
That's why experts don't do it that way.

39
00:02:44,960 --> 00:02:50,680
They take national annual averages and build up a complete picture.

40
00:02:50,680 --> 00:02:55,620
And by including all the data, this is the complete picture, and right away you can see

41
00:02:55,620 --> 00:02:58,200
the obvious warming trend.

42
00:02:58,200 --> 00:03:03,520
This reconstruction from Berkeley Earth shows a 12-month moving average in grey and a 10-year

43
00:03:03,520 --> 00:03:08,780
moving average in red, and this one, which is a straight plot of average annual temperatures

44
00:03:08,780 --> 00:03:12,520
over time, comes from the Bureau of Meteorology.

45
00:03:12,520 --> 00:03:20,120
And that's how the BOM determined that December 17th 2019 was the hottest day on record thus far.

46
00:03:20,120 --> 00:03:24,620
So when BOM says it was the hottest day on record, what exactly does that mean?

47
00:03:24,620 --> 00:03:28,400
Does that mean going back 20 years, 30 years, 50 years?

48
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:32,480
Well it means that the average temperature across the whole country, taking data from

49
00:03:32,480 --> 00:03:38,440
all the weather stations, shows that up to that time, December 17th 2019 was the hottest

50
00:03:38,440 --> 00:03:40,080
on record.

51
00:03:40,080 --> 00:03:46,620
And since the Bureau of Meteorology's records began in 1910, that means since 1910, unless

52
00:03:46,620 --> 00:03:48,720
the BOM specifies otherwise.

53
00:03:48,720 --> 00:03:52,720
The Bureau of Meteorology's claiming that Australia's hottest day on record came on

54
00:03:52,720 --> 00:03:57,620
a day when BOREC was 24 degrees below their all-time record maximum.

55
00:03:57,620 --> 00:03:59,520
That doesn't sound very credible to me.

56
00:03:59,520 --> 00:04:04,340
Yeah, but that's why this data analysis is best left to qualified professionals.

57
00:04:04,340 --> 00:04:09,100
A record high average doesn't mean that every single weather station has to hit a record

58
00:04:09,140 --> 00:04:11,620
high temperature on that day.

59
00:04:11,620 --> 00:04:17,100
It means that the average of all the weather stations is at a record high.

60
00:04:17,100 --> 00:04:20,580
Most will be below their individual all-time highs.

61
00:04:20,580 --> 00:04:25,620
That's especially true of BOREC, which unofficially recorded Australia's hottest ever temperature

62
00:04:25,620 --> 00:04:29,840
of 51.7 degrees centigrade in 1909.

63
00:04:29,840 --> 00:04:34,540
The reading is thought to be a mistake, but even if it's accurate, BOREC is very unlikely

64
00:04:34,540 --> 00:04:40,340
to match that record just because Australia's national average hits a record high.

65
00:04:40,340 --> 00:04:42,500
Climate doesn't work that way.

66
00:04:42,500 --> 00:04:47,140
It's a big continent, and on that particular day the south-east of Australia, including

67
00:04:47,140 --> 00:04:51,900
BOREC, was influenced by a weather front in the Tasman Sea, and temperatures were mostly

68
00:04:51,900 --> 00:04:54,080
below average.

69
00:04:54,080 --> 00:04:56,540
Temperatures haven't been significantly higher either.

70
00:04:56,540 --> 00:05:03,220
In fact, during the years 1899 to 1901, average December mean maximum temperatures were well

71
00:05:03,260 --> 00:05:05,740
above 38 degrees.

72
00:05:05,740 --> 00:05:09,000
But why not read the caption on your own graph?

73
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:11,780
This isn't the mean temperature for Australia.

74
00:05:11,780 --> 00:05:14,220
It's the data from just one weather station.

75
00:05:14,220 --> 00:05:18,280
Don't they teach the concept of averages in schools any more?

76
00:05:18,280 --> 00:05:23,700
You have to look at the average annual temperature data, not just cherry-pick one place in one

77
00:05:23,700 --> 00:05:26,960
month that gives you the result you want.

78
00:05:26,960 --> 00:05:31,260
The only way you can dismiss this pretty clear temperature rise is to believe that there's

79
00:05:31,260 --> 00:05:36,460
a conspiracy to cook up fraudulent figures and somehow hide the real ones.

80
00:05:36,460 --> 00:05:41,020
Note that the weather girl is cleverly standing in front of eastern Australia, and it wasn't

81
00:05:41,020 --> 00:05:43,860
particularly hot over there on December 17th.

82
00:05:43,860 --> 00:05:48,740
So that's how they hide below average temperatures, by sticking a weather girl in front of them.

83
00:05:48,740 --> 00:05:51,700
What a cunning plan, simple yet brilliant.

84
00:05:51,700 --> 00:05:55,960
I guess from now on I'll check the weather the way most Aussies do, from the numerous

85
00:05:55,960 --> 00:06:00,980
TV forecasts we get every day where weather presenters can't get in the way, well unless

86
00:06:00,980 --> 00:06:03,940
you live in Mexico where it's unavoidable.

87
00:06:03,940 --> 00:06:06,020
Time for hide the data plan B.

88
00:06:06,020 --> 00:06:09,820
But if we look at the Bureau of Meteorology's temperature graph for Australia, you can see

89
00:06:09,820 --> 00:06:12,100
they begin in 1910.

90
00:06:12,100 --> 00:06:15,800
They hide all of the extremely hot weather which occurred prior to then.

91
00:06:15,800 --> 00:06:20,100
What certainly sounds devious, but instead of jumping straight to the conclusion that

92
00:06:20,100 --> 00:06:24,040
there's a conspiracy, why not simply find out the reason?

93
00:06:24,040 --> 00:06:27,860
It only requires a little bit of effort because the answer's right there on the Bureau of

94
00:06:27,860 --> 00:06:29,840
Meteorology website.

95
00:06:29,840 --> 00:06:36,740
The BOM didn't have any data before 1910 because it only started operations in 1908.

96
00:06:36,740 --> 00:06:40,720
And while your next question will probably be, why didn't they show other data that

97
00:06:40,720 --> 00:06:45,880
had been collected before they were founded, the answer to that is also pretty easy.

98
00:06:45,880 --> 00:06:46,900
They do.

99
00:06:46,900 --> 00:06:52,080
The data for all the stations prior to 1910 is freely available on the Bureau of Meteorology

100
00:06:52,080 --> 00:06:53,080
website.

101
00:06:53,080 --> 00:06:57,920
In fact, we've already seen one, and there's also an historical reconstruction based on

102
00:06:57,920 --> 00:07:03,080
that data, also on the BOM website compiled by Berkeley Earth.

103
00:07:03,080 --> 00:07:09,080
The problem, as you can see, is that the readings have huge margins of error prior to 1910 because

104
00:07:09,080 --> 00:07:11,840
there was no standardisation.

105
00:07:11,840 --> 00:07:16,200
Weather stations were using different instruments, taking readings at different times of day

106
00:07:16,200 --> 00:07:18,400
and under different conditions.

107
00:07:18,400 --> 00:07:23,740
So as soon as it was founded, the BOM standardised meteorological instruments and data gathering

108
00:07:23,740 --> 00:07:26,960
techniques all across Australia.

109
00:07:26,960 --> 00:07:31,760
So while the Bureau of Meteorology is happy to put all this pre-1910 data on its website

110
00:07:31,760 --> 00:07:37,000
for you to download, as well as reconstructions that use it, it does so with a warning that

111
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:39,360
the data is not reliable.

112
00:07:39,360 --> 00:07:44,800
That's why it starts its own official records from the year of standardisation, 1910.

113
00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:48,880
Actually, let's just get back to that page from their website.

114
00:07:48,880 --> 00:07:53,680
If you look at the value on the right hand side, just after the year 2000, notice how

115
00:07:53,680 --> 00:07:54,680
that…what?

116
00:07:54,680 --> 00:07:57,520
They're hiding the figures!

117
00:07:57,520 --> 00:07:58,520
Not again!

118
00:07:58,520 --> 00:08:02,120
Damn your cunning tricks, Bureau of Meteorology!

119
00:08:02,120 --> 00:08:05,440
So obviously I can't show you that, but let's go on and look at the drought.

120
00:08:05,440 --> 00:08:10,120
It's a hard one to define because there are so many different ways of measuring it.

121
00:08:10,120 --> 00:08:15,240
But if we take rainfall alone, there's no evidence that Australia is getting less rain

122
00:08:15,240 --> 00:08:17,040
and no reason why it should.

123
00:08:17,040 --> 00:08:20,800
What's happening is that rainfall patterns are changing.

124
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:25,960
If we start looking at patterns from 1950, about the time temperatures began rising,

125
00:08:25,960 --> 00:08:30,760
eastern and southwestern parts of Australia, which are the big population and agricultural

126
00:08:30,760 --> 00:08:36,760
centres seem to be getting drier, while the north and northwest are getting wetter.

127
00:08:36,760 --> 00:08:40,560
And that's being confirmed by scientific studies, which we'll look at more closely

128
00:08:40,560 --> 00:08:42,600
later in the video.

129
00:08:42,600 --> 00:08:46,880
So that brings us on to the most relevant trend, the fires themselves.

130
00:08:46,880 --> 00:08:51,400
Is the 2019-2020 fire season perfectly normal?

131
00:08:51,400 --> 00:08:57,520
Australia's acting and retired fire chiefs, each with a lifetime experience fighting bushfires,

132
00:08:57,520 --> 00:09:01,800
came together to warn the government, no, this is not normal.

133
00:09:01,800 --> 00:09:07,320
Never before have we had 17 concurrent emergency warning fires burning at once.

134
00:09:07,320 --> 00:09:09,160
So there's something going on.

135
00:09:09,160 --> 00:09:11,720
And that's supported by scientific studies.

136
00:09:11,720 --> 00:09:17,320
The best way to quantify this is to look at the FFDI, the Forest Fire Danger Index,

137
00:09:17,320 --> 00:09:22,520
which measures the likelihood of fires breaking out based on rainfall, evaporation, humidity,

138
00:09:22,520 --> 00:09:24,880
temperature and other factors.

139
00:09:24,880 --> 00:09:29,600
At least two studies have shown that the FFDI has been trending upwards.

140
00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:34,400
This 2007 study is interesting because it not only found that the FFDI rose for the

141
00:09:34,400 --> 00:09:39,920
previous three decades, but it predicted that fire weather conditions would worsen, increasing

142
00:09:39,920 --> 00:09:44,760
the FFDI between 4 and 25 per cent by 2020.

143
00:09:44,760 --> 00:09:46,360
That's now.

144
00:09:46,360 --> 00:09:50,960
And this study found that the FFDI increased significantly in nearly half the stations

145
00:09:50,960 --> 00:09:57,280
it checked between 1973 and 2010, a clear upward trend.

146
00:09:57,280 --> 00:10:00,960
All of which means, yes, there is something to see here.

147
00:10:00,960 --> 00:10:06,800
So the next excuse is, but it's not climate change, it's arsonists.

148
00:10:06,800 --> 00:10:09,920
What was the heart, the arson element of this story?

149
00:10:09,920 --> 00:10:10,920
That was my question.

150
00:10:10,920 --> 00:10:11,920
Oh, my God.

151
00:10:11,920 --> 00:10:14,980
Now we've got five bloody armchair experts.

152
00:10:14,980 --> 00:10:16,160
It's hard to tell what's true or not.

153
00:10:16,160 --> 00:10:21,080
I see pictures of people who allegedly set the fires and they're running away and there's

154
00:10:21,080 --> 00:10:26,160
50 people in jail on charges of arson or something in Australia.

155
00:10:26,160 --> 00:10:28,160
But, you know, they've been charged.

156
00:10:28,160 --> 00:10:30,040
But have they been found guilty yet?

157
00:10:30,040 --> 00:10:31,040
I don't know.

158
00:10:31,040 --> 00:10:34,680
Aren't some of the arsonists climate nutters, though, as well?

159
00:10:34,680 --> 00:10:37,960
Guess what the primary cause of these fires was?

160
00:10:37,960 --> 00:10:40,520
People deliberately starting the fires.

161
00:10:40,520 --> 00:10:43,320
Now that may be true, but it isn't.

162
00:10:43,320 --> 00:10:45,520
You can't just make stuff up out of thin air.

163
00:10:45,520 --> 00:10:47,760
You have to check the figures.

164
00:10:47,760 --> 00:10:54,360
According to the Australian Institute of Criminology, from September 2019 to December 2019, which

165
00:10:54,360 --> 00:10:59,640
was when you decided we needed the benefit of your McExpert opinion, only around 13 per

166
00:10:59,640 --> 00:11:02,340
cent of fires were started by arson.

167
00:11:02,340 --> 00:11:04,900
That's hardly the primary cause.

168
00:11:04,900 --> 00:11:10,340
It's possible many of the 36 per cent of fires deemed suspicious may turn out to be arson.

169
00:11:10,340 --> 00:11:11,340
We don't know.

170
00:11:11,340 --> 00:11:15,860
And there's loads of articles talking about how now the fires are being blamed on arsonists.

171
00:11:15,860 --> 00:11:19,300
I'm sure there are, but that doesn't mean it's true.

172
00:11:19,300 --> 00:11:23,880
James Delingpole, a columnist for Breitbart News who never studied science past playing

173
00:11:23,880 --> 00:11:29,000
with Newton's balls at prep school, thinks there are 180 arsonists.

174
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:33,720
This guy thinks there are 183 arsonists, and he even knows the political philosophy

175
00:11:33,720 --> 00:11:35,120
of everyone.

176
00:11:35,120 --> 00:11:37,840
Apparently they're all leftists.

177
00:11:37,840 --> 00:11:43,880
This figure, either 183, more than 180 or nearly 200, has been going round the blogosphere

178
00:11:43,880 --> 00:11:49,480
so many times that Donald Trump Jr picked up on it and tweeted it to thousands of his

179
00:11:49,480 --> 00:11:50,480
followers.

180
00:11:50,480 --> 00:11:53,160
In Australia, it's known as a furphy.

181
00:11:53,160 --> 00:11:58,720
Or to put it in words that the McExperts understand, it's all total bullshit.

182
00:11:58,720 --> 00:12:00,760
So where does this figure come from?

183
00:12:00,760 --> 00:12:06,160
Well, it started with a completely false headline in the Australian newspaper.

184
00:12:06,160 --> 00:12:11,380
Firebugs fuelling crisis as national arson arrest toll hits 183.

185
00:12:11,380 --> 00:12:17,600
The Australian is published by Rupert Murdoch, so accuracy is not exactly a priority.

186
00:12:17,600 --> 00:12:24,080
The Australian cites its source as a NSW police report, so let's go to the source and, yes,

187
00:12:24,080 --> 00:12:29,200
your way ahead of me, discover how the headline writers got it wrong.

188
00:12:29,200 --> 00:12:35,480
Turns out these weren't 183 cases of arson, they were 183 cases of fire-related incidents

189
00:12:35,480 --> 00:12:37,320
in NSW.

190
00:12:37,320 --> 00:12:42,560
Only 24 people were charged with arson, 57 had legal action, which could be as simple

191
00:12:42,560 --> 00:12:48,260
as a caution, for failing to comply with the total fire ban, for example by lighting campfires

192
00:12:48,260 --> 00:12:54,160
or barbecues or even operating machinery in areas where a fire ban is in place.

193
00:12:54,160 --> 00:12:59,980
And 47 were cautioned or charged with discarding matches or lit cigarettes on the ground.

194
00:12:59,980 --> 00:13:07,140
So 24 alleged arsonists gets bumped up to 183 and then rounded up to nearly 200.

195
00:13:07,140 --> 00:13:11,780
You have to read past the fake headlines to see the actual figures buried in the body

196
00:13:11,780 --> 00:13:17,240
of these stories, which of course most armchair experts can't be bothered to do.

197
00:13:17,240 --> 00:13:23,200
But OK, even 24 of these huge fires is nothing to scoff at, and there are many more suspected

198
00:13:23,200 --> 00:13:27,460
arson attacks where the perpetrators haven't been caught.

199
00:13:27,460 --> 00:13:32,720
But it turns out that arsonists aren't responsible for most of these big fires.

200
00:13:32,720 --> 00:13:38,120
According to the experts, remember them, the most common cause is not arson or discarded

201
00:13:38,120 --> 00:13:43,880
cigarettes or any form of human activity, the most common cause by far is lightning

202
00:13:43,880 --> 00:13:45,520
strikes.

203
00:13:45,840 --> 00:13:49,440
Inspector Ben Sheppard of the NSW Rural Fire Service said,

204
00:13:49,440 --> 00:13:53,640
I can confidently say the majority of larger fires we've been dealing with have been

205
00:13:53,640 --> 00:13:59,400
the result of fires coming out of remote areas as a result of dry lightning storms.

206
00:13:59,400 --> 00:14:03,680
According to Brett Mitchell, CFA Incident Controller in Bairnsdale, East Gippsland,

207
00:14:03,680 --> 00:14:09,080
where some of the worst fires occurred, most of the fires have been caused by lightning.

208
00:14:09,080 --> 00:14:14,040
And Victoria's Fire Chief says dry lightning, not arson, is the main cause of the state's

209
00:14:14,040 --> 00:14:16,280
destructive bushfires.

210
00:14:16,280 --> 00:14:21,860
But how can that be, you ask, if the statistics I've just quoted show that natural causes

211
00:14:21,860 --> 00:14:28,200
like lightning strikes are only responsible for starting about 6% of the fires?

212
00:14:28,200 --> 00:14:30,820
Well because not all fires are equal.

213
00:14:30,820 --> 00:14:35,240
One fire might be huge, another might be tiny.

214
00:14:35,240 --> 00:14:40,240
Most fires started accidentally or deliberately by humans are quickly spotted and in places

215
00:14:40,240 --> 00:14:43,600
that are easily accessible to fire trucks.

216
00:14:43,600 --> 00:14:48,280
Fires from lightning strikes tend to start in remote areas of thick forest and bushland

217
00:14:48,280 --> 00:14:52,520
where there's lots of fuel and they're hard to reach, and hard to control.

218
00:14:52,520 --> 00:14:57,280
They're the ones burning up millions of acres of forest and becoming unstoppable as

219
00:14:57,280 --> 00:14:59,080
they advance on small towns.

220
00:14:59,080 --> 00:15:03,520
That's why the Fire Chiefs are saying, it's lightning that's responsible for these

221
00:15:03,520 --> 00:15:05,720
large fires.

222
00:15:05,720 --> 00:15:10,840
Most arson offences relate to small grass fires and things like rubbish bins set alight.

223
00:15:10,840 --> 00:15:17,900
In Victoria, only about 0.03% of the millions of acres burned was due to arson.

224
00:15:17,900 --> 00:15:22,440
And none of South Australia's deadliest or most destructive fires are being treated

225
00:15:22,440 --> 00:15:24,440
as suspicious.

226
00:15:24,440 --> 00:15:29,320
That doesn't mean to say arson isn't a serious problem, arsonists are a bloody menace

227
00:15:29,320 --> 00:15:34,000
and sometimes they are responsible for destroying homes and even killing people.

228
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:36,560
But unfortunately they're nothing new.

229
00:15:36,560 --> 00:15:40,740
What's different between this season and last season is not the sudden appearance of

230
00:15:40,740 --> 00:15:46,120
an army of arsonists, but a long period of drought, record high air temperature and a

231
00:15:46,120 --> 00:15:51,180
higher forest fire danger index, which are all part of a growing trend.

232
00:15:51,180 --> 00:15:56,180
So when lightning strikes, these hot dry forests erupt in flame.

233
00:15:56,180 --> 00:16:01,080
So the objective of this disinformation campaign seems to be to take attention away from these

234
00:16:01,080 --> 00:16:06,540
worsening fire conditions and blame Australians themselves for starting these fires, which

235
00:16:06,540 --> 00:16:10,180
is not only misleading, but insulting.

236
00:16:10,180 --> 00:16:13,820
And if that doesn't work, we'll find someone else to blame.

237
00:16:13,820 --> 00:16:17,140
OK, so who knows about this?

238
00:16:17,140 --> 00:16:18,760
Oh, I have something.

239
00:16:18,760 --> 00:16:21,780
I think you can guess this isn't going to turn out well.

240
00:16:21,780 --> 00:16:28,740
I was reading a paper the other day and one of the stories was about how actually the

241
00:16:28,740 --> 00:16:33,540
reason that the fires are getting so bad is they stopped doing controlled burns.

242
00:16:33,540 --> 00:16:38,980
Yeah, yeah, that's a classic example of land management issue, isn't it?

243
00:16:38,980 --> 00:16:42,040
They're not clearing the end of growth, they're not doing controlled burns.

244
00:16:42,040 --> 00:16:47,120
Because green environmentalist policies have outlawed property owners doing controlled

245
00:16:47,120 --> 00:16:52,060
burns that create firebreaks to prevent inferno spreading.

246
00:16:52,060 --> 00:16:56,680
What's happening is radical left-wing environmentalists in Australia are stopping the country from

247
00:16:56,680 --> 00:17:01,420
conducting the controlled burns it needs to keep these wildfires from happening.

248
00:17:01,420 --> 00:17:06,100
Turns out he's referencing a Breitbart News op-ed by our old friend James Delingpole,

249
00:17:06,100 --> 00:17:07,900
the political commentator.

250
00:17:07,900 --> 00:17:10,980
And it got passed around the internet by everybody else.

251
00:17:10,980 --> 00:17:15,740
So let's inject a few facts into this maelstrom of ignogeneous ignorance.

252
00:17:15,740 --> 00:17:21,520
Firstly, the Green Party, which is pretty representative of the Greenies in Australia,

253
00:17:21,520 --> 00:17:23,120
supports prescribed burns.

254
00:17:23,120 --> 00:17:24,980
It says so in its manifesto.

255
00:17:24,980 --> 00:17:29,780
Secondly, the fire chiefs, and in case you've forgotten, they are the experts, not the POMI

256
00:17:29,780 --> 00:17:33,280
politicos, say this is not a problem they face.

257
00:17:33,280 --> 00:17:38,880
The single biggest impediment to completing hazard reduction burning is the weather.

258
00:17:38,880 --> 00:17:44,820
And with longer fire seasons, earlier starts and later finishes to fire seasons, like we've

259
00:17:44,820 --> 00:17:50,440
been experiencing over recent times, you get a shrinking window of opportunity for more

260
00:17:50,440 --> 00:17:52,840
favourable hazard reduction burning periods.

261
00:17:52,840 --> 00:17:59,320
And in that shrinking window you get the extremes of it can be too wet and too cold to effectively

262
00:17:59,320 --> 00:18:05,200
get hazard reduction burns done through to it being too hot and too dry and therefore

263
00:18:05,200 --> 00:18:06,200
too dangerous.

264
00:18:06,200 --> 00:18:11,120
Look, it's very clear, and any fire service will tell you, that the windows for hazard

265
00:18:11,120 --> 00:18:14,680
reduction through the winter are getting narrower and narrower.

266
00:18:14,680 --> 00:18:19,500
Now, a slight lift in temperature overall, average temperature, means the extremes are

267
00:18:19,500 --> 00:18:22,020
more extreme.

268
00:18:22,020 --> 00:18:24,640
We can't light a burn and just let it run.

269
00:18:24,640 --> 00:18:27,240
Lighting a hazard reduction burn is complicated.

270
00:18:27,240 --> 00:18:28,520
It's resource hungry.

271
00:18:28,520 --> 00:18:29,700
It's risky.

272
00:18:29,700 --> 00:18:34,360
And the minute we see a burn lit, I end up getting inundated with claims for people wanting

273
00:18:34,360 --> 00:18:37,600
us to pay for their shade cloth on their greenhouse.

274
00:18:37,600 --> 00:18:41,760
The suntough on their back pergola has now got embers that have landed on it.

275
00:18:41,760 --> 00:18:46,720
So there's so many ramifications that come from prescribed burning.

276
00:18:46,720 --> 00:18:52,580
Hazard reduction has a place and is a valuable tool for day-to-day fires, for normal seasons.

277
00:18:52,580 --> 00:18:56,400
But when you've got a really tough season, when you've got awful fire weather conditions,

278
00:18:56,400 --> 00:19:01,200
so when you're running fires under severe extreme or worse conditions, hazard reduction

279
00:19:01,200 --> 00:19:04,760
has very little effect at all on fire spread.

280
00:19:04,760 --> 00:19:10,640
It's only when the conditions back off a little bit, generally speaking overnight, or when

281
00:19:10,640 --> 00:19:15,020
the severe extreme or catastrophic conditions get right back to, say, very high, that you've

282
00:19:15,020 --> 00:19:18,080
actually got some prospect of slowing the fire spread.

283
00:19:18,080 --> 00:19:22,600
So it's important, but not the panacea, and something that we should have a very open

284
00:19:22,600 --> 00:19:24,600
and frank discussion about.

285
00:19:24,600 --> 00:19:28,440
The other point here is about all the emotion around these fuel reduction burns.

286
00:19:28,440 --> 00:19:34,160
The reality is, I am concerned, and it's interesting now, my peer in New South Wales has come out

287
00:19:34,160 --> 00:19:38,920
quite strongly, Shane Fitzsimmons, and said exactly the same thing, which is essentially,

288
00:19:38,920 --> 00:19:42,600
we can't see these fuel reduction burns as a silver bullet.

289
00:19:42,600 --> 00:19:47,980
Yes, we need to do fuel reduction burns, but they're not going to solve all our problems.

290
00:19:47,980 --> 00:19:52,560
So an example in Gippsland, where we had a fuel reduction burn go through in 2014, didn't

291
00:19:52,560 --> 00:19:54,340
slow this fire up at all.

292
00:19:54,340 --> 00:19:59,380
And I can say, in any given year, of all the burns that we've got ready to go, 70 or 80

293
00:19:59,380 --> 00:20:01,540
per cent are cleared, environmentally ready to go.

294
00:20:01,540 --> 00:20:04,100
We're just waiting for the window of opportunity.

295
00:20:04,100 --> 00:20:09,380
We've gone from completing, lucky to be 40 or 50 per cent of our annual burn programs,

296
00:20:09,380 --> 00:20:12,000
to now up to 80 or 90 per cent of our burn programs.

297
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:15,620
And according to the New South Wales Department of Planning, Industry and Environment, the

298
00:20:15,620 --> 00:20:21,140
main reason for the increase is not the successful quashing of greeny protests, but increased

299
00:20:21,140 --> 00:20:24,260
funding for the crews that do this hazard reduction work.

300
00:20:24,260 --> 00:20:26,100
Sorry, carry on, Shane.

301
00:20:26,100 --> 00:20:30,020
If there's a risk in an area and it needs treating with hazard reduction work, we can

302
00:20:30,020 --> 00:20:34,460
serve notices on private and public landholders to get that work done.

303
00:20:34,460 --> 00:20:39,580
Yes, burning is important, but some of the hysteria that this will be the problem that

304
00:20:39,580 --> 00:20:44,300
solves or the solution to all our problems is really just quite an emotional load of

305
00:20:44,300 --> 00:20:45,860
rubbish to be honest.

306
00:20:45,860 --> 00:20:47,660
The figures back all that up.

307
00:20:47,660 --> 00:20:52,120
In its most recent annual report, the New South Wales Rural Fire Service said it had

308
00:20:52,120 --> 00:20:59,300
planned 19,896 prescribed burns and carried out 16,556 of them.

309
00:20:59,300 --> 00:21:01,340
That's 83 per cent.

310
00:21:01,340 --> 00:21:05,680
I'm sure people will post anecdotal tales on the forum of how they weren't allowed to

311
00:21:05,680 --> 00:21:10,820
remove trees or burn bush on their own properties, but every council is different.

312
00:21:10,820 --> 00:21:13,120
Every neighbourhood is different.

313
00:21:13,120 --> 00:21:15,380
This is the view from my backyard.

314
00:21:15,380 --> 00:21:20,440
We've had to evacuate twice as forest fires got close, so I'd love to do a prescribed

315
00:21:20,440 --> 00:21:25,140
burn every couple of years in our wooded area that backs onto a national forest, or have

316
00:21:25,140 --> 00:21:27,620
the fire service come in and do it.

317
00:21:27,620 --> 00:21:32,360
But even if conditions were right during the short time period available between ever lengthening

318
00:21:32,360 --> 00:21:37,060
fire seasons, the biggest objections would come from my neighbours.

319
00:21:37,060 --> 00:21:40,840
Not because they're greenies, but because they're worried that a prescribed burn might

320
00:21:40,840 --> 00:21:44,980
get out of control and destroy their half million dollar houses.

321
00:21:44,980 --> 00:21:46,960
That does happen.

322
00:21:46,960 --> 00:21:52,720
Regardless of individual cases, what these trained and experienced fire chiefs are explaining

323
00:21:52,720 --> 00:21:57,940
is the overall picture of the difficulties they face in carrying out prescribed burns,

324
00:21:57,940 --> 00:22:03,520
the success they've had despite these difficulties, the increased rates of hazard reduction, the

325
00:22:03,520 --> 00:22:08,200
fact that these prescribed burns aren't a panacea anyway, and their frustration at the

326
00:22:08,200 --> 00:22:12,560
way armchair critics are getting emotional over the issue rather than looking at the

327
00:22:12,560 --> 00:22:14,320
facts.

328
00:22:14,320 --> 00:22:18,740
And when the blame game runs out, it's finally time to face the question of whether climate

329
00:22:18,740 --> 00:22:21,900
change might be contributing to this.

330
00:22:21,900 --> 00:22:25,660
If you're into science and facts, you have to accept that the nation's most pre-eminent

331
00:22:25,660 --> 00:22:30,280
experts say there's no direct link between this drought and climate change.

332
00:22:30,280 --> 00:22:32,180
There's no long-term drying trend.

333
00:22:32,180 --> 00:22:34,540
Now the first part of that is true.

334
00:22:34,540 --> 00:22:38,900
Most experts say you can't attribute a single drought or a single weather event to climate

335
00:22:38,900 --> 00:22:40,300
change.

336
00:22:40,300 --> 00:22:44,840
For example, let's hear from Sarah Perkins Kirkpatrick, a senior researcher on climate

337
00:22:44,840 --> 00:22:46,880
at the University of New South Wales.

338
00:22:46,880 --> 00:22:51,020
So the last few winters we've had really low rainfall, and that's obviously what's ignited

339
00:22:51,020 --> 00:22:54,960
the drought and it's, you know, perpetuated for that amount of time, but we can't really

340
00:22:54,960 --> 00:22:58,680
find a signal due to natural variability in there, nor climate change.

341
00:22:58,680 --> 00:23:01,260
It's not to say neither of one of those is driving it.

342
00:23:01,260 --> 00:23:05,160
It's just not as obvious as what we would expect it to be.

343
00:23:05,160 --> 00:23:07,280
But the second part of Sky News's claim…

344
00:23:07,280 --> 00:23:11,780
The nation's most pre-eminent experts say there's no long-term drying trend.

345
00:23:11,780 --> 00:23:13,680
… is incorrect.

346
00:23:13,680 --> 00:23:17,780
Here are some of the nation's most pre-eminent climate experts, and that's exactly what

347
00:23:17,780 --> 00:23:19,100
they say.

348
00:23:19,100 --> 00:23:23,780
They condense their published research into a report in plain language that even arts

349
00:23:23,780 --> 00:23:27,080
graduates and political commentators can understand.

350
00:23:27,080 --> 00:23:32,580
Climate change is likely making drought conditions in south-west and south-east Australia worse.

351
00:23:32,580 --> 00:23:36,540
In Australia it's clear that climate change has reduced rainfall in the south-east and

352
00:23:36,540 --> 00:23:38,920
south-west corners of the continent.

353
00:23:38,920 --> 00:23:43,440
Precipitation patterns have changed markedly over the past two decades, with a pronounced

354
00:23:43,440 --> 00:23:46,920
drying trend in these two important agricultural regions.

355
00:23:46,920 --> 00:23:49,880
So which experts is he getting his information from?

356
00:23:49,880 --> 00:23:56,400
Well I listen to scientists and my key source is Professor Andy Pitman, who's a world-renowned

357
00:23:56,400 --> 00:23:57,920
expert in this area.

358
00:23:57,920 --> 00:24:03,160
Well maybe you're either not listening to Dr Pitman, or you don't understand his research.

359
00:24:03,160 --> 00:24:08,060
In plain language Dr Pitman says higher temperatures don't lead directly to higher evaporation

360
00:24:08,060 --> 00:24:12,860
and a higher risk of drought, but he says they do lead to changes in rainfall patterns

361
00:24:12,860 --> 00:24:14,920
which can lead to drought.

362
00:24:14,920 --> 00:24:19,860
In some regions, says Dr Pitman, global warming increases the risk of drought, and in other

363
00:24:19,860 --> 00:24:24,740
regions it decreases the risk, as we've already seen.

364
00:24:24,740 --> 00:24:29,300
Even the Australian Research Council's Centre of Excellence for Climate Extremes, where

365
00:24:29,300 --> 00:24:36,200
Dr Pitman is director, had to issue a media release telling these TV and newspaper McExperts

366
00:24:36,200 --> 00:24:39,120
to stop misrepresenting him.

367
00:24:39,120 --> 00:24:43,480
Stop claiming our scientists and director Andy Pitman say there is no connection between

368
00:24:43,480 --> 00:24:45,320
drought and climate change.

369
00:24:45,320 --> 00:24:50,960
There is a connection, and unlike your public statements on climate change, it is nuanced.

370
00:24:50,960 --> 00:24:52,900
See here.

371
00:24:52,900 --> 00:24:55,920
Which is exactly what all the other experts are saying.

372
00:24:55,920 --> 00:24:59,780
Experts in the affected regions were caused by a natural weather phenomenon, the Indian

373
00:24:59,780 --> 00:25:03,340
Ocean Dipole, not by man-made climate change.

374
00:25:03,340 --> 00:25:08,060
Sorry, I accidentally injected a clip of another political commentator who's so knowledgeable

375
00:25:08,060 --> 00:25:12,260
about the Indian Ocean Dipole, he thinks it's called a dipole.

376
00:25:12,260 --> 00:25:15,860
It's almost as if he's just heard about it for the first time.

377
00:25:15,860 --> 00:25:20,140
And while this guy may sound like an expert because he addresses his army of loyal followers

378
00:25:20,140 --> 00:25:25,900
with authority and confidence, he's actually one of Australia's most famous political commentators

379
00:25:25,900 --> 00:25:31,040
and another McExpert who doesn't know an Indian Ocean Dipole from a stripper's pole.

380
00:25:31,040 --> 00:25:35,680
There is no reason why climate change should make the landscape more arid.

381
00:25:35,680 --> 00:25:40,920
Well, of course, the experts say there is, you just have to understand it.

382
00:25:40,920 --> 00:25:45,640
And that means firstly understanding the three main natural climate patterns that govern

383
00:25:45,640 --> 00:25:47,620
Australia's rainfall.

384
00:25:47,620 --> 00:25:53,580
To the west, the Indian Ocean Dipole, the Indian Ocean Dipole, the Indian Ocean Dipole

385
00:25:53,580 --> 00:25:57,920
is caused by a temperature differential between the western and eastern parts of the Indian

386
00:25:57,920 --> 00:26:02,020
Ocean, hence the word dipole, shut up.

387
00:26:02,020 --> 00:26:07,400
When it's in a negative phase, warmer water is closer to Australia and we get more rain.

388
00:26:07,400 --> 00:26:11,020
When it's in a positive phase, the opposite happens.

389
00:26:11,020 --> 00:26:17,480
To the east is the El Niño-southern Oscillation, or ENSO, which has a similar temperature differential,

390
00:26:17,480 --> 00:26:20,700
changing rainfall patterns in eastern Australia.

391
00:26:20,740 --> 00:26:25,600
And to the south is the southern annular mode, or the SAM, which pushes rain fronts into

392
00:26:25,600 --> 00:26:31,160
southern Australia in its negative mode but keeps the rain back in its positive mode.

393
00:26:31,160 --> 00:26:35,220
So the worst droughts are caused when more than one of these weather patterns coincides

394
00:26:35,220 --> 00:26:39,880
by giving us the same dry conditions, and that's what's been happening recently with

395
00:26:39,880 --> 00:26:42,440
the AOD and the SAM.

396
00:26:42,440 --> 00:26:46,700
So if it's perfectly natural, why blame climate change?

397
00:26:46,700 --> 00:26:51,480
Because these phenomena are all driven by temperature, especially ocean temperature,

398
00:26:51,480 --> 00:26:56,000
which has been rising, hitting a record high in 2019.

399
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:57,960
Time to hear again from a real expert.

400
00:26:57,960 --> 00:27:03,000
Australia is known for its extremes, and without climate change we're a land of extremes because

401
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:07,640
of these variability things that influence us, so we know that at some point they're

402
00:27:07,640 --> 00:27:11,900
going to happen, but put climate change on top of that and it exacerbates those extremes

403
00:27:11,900 --> 00:27:12,900
even further.

404
00:27:12,900 --> 00:27:16,160
And it's not just something that we kind of knew about last year.

405
00:27:16,160 --> 00:27:19,540
What scientists have been talking about is for decades, so we expect to see more extreme

406
00:27:19,540 --> 00:27:20,540
heat.

407
00:27:20,540 --> 00:27:23,620
When we see flooding we expect that to be more extreme, and when we get bushfires we

408
00:27:23,620 --> 00:27:25,820
expect them to be more extreme too.

409
00:27:25,820 --> 00:27:29,220
And especially over eastern Australia, over some parts of Australia there's not really

410
00:27:29,220 --> 00:27:34,620
much of a signal, but over the southeast, longer fire seasons and more intense fires

411
00:27:34,620 --> 00:27:36,540
are conducive with climate change.

412
00:27:36,540 --> 00:27:41,160
So what the experts are saying is that these are natural phenomena, they're what's driven

413
00:27:41,160 --> 00:27:46,140
Australian heatwaves, droughts and bushfires in the past, but in the last few decades

414
00:27:46,140 --> 00:27:50,480
they've been happening on a rising platform of global temperature, which means that every

415
00:27:50,480 --> 00:27:57,240
weather event is more accentuated from droughts and heatwaves to rainfall and floods.

416
00:27:57,240 --> 00:28:01,160
Studies have shown the influence of global warming on these natural phenomena.

417
00:28:01,160 --> 00:28:06,280
Back in 2009 this study laid the blame for recent droughts on a positive Indian Ocean

418
00:28:06,280 --> 00:28:10,520
Dipole exacerbated by rising temperatures.

419
00:28:10,520 --> 00:28:16,260
In the same year this paper concluded that the Indian Ocean Dipole Index has been increasing

420
00:28:16,260 --> 00:28:21,600
along with regional temperatures and concluded that climate change will increase the occurrence

421
00:28:21,600 --> 00:28:24,060
of positive IOD events.

422
00:28:24,060 --> 00:28:26,620
Those are the ones that cause drought.

423
00:28:26,620 --> 00:28:31,300
So if scientists are pointing the finger at climate change not as a cause but as an amplifier

424
00:28:31,300 --> 00:28:36,780
of natural causes, making heatwaves, droughts and bushfires worse, what excuses are left

425
00:28:36,780 --> 00:28:38,660
to ignore it?

426
00:28:38,680 --> 00:28:44,240
Well it's the old thoughts and prayers excuse, now is not the time to talk about it.

427
00:28:44,240 --> 00:28:47,880
My only thoughts today are with those who have lost their lives.

428
00:28:47,880 --> 00:28:51,120
I certainly don't think it's appropriate to get into a political argument.

429
00:28:51,120 --> 00:28:54,400
I'll tell you this, I'm not going to cop it and if that's the rest of this interview

430
00:28:54,400 --> 00:28:56,120
we'll give lost news for the morning.

431
00:28:56,120 --> 00:29:01,560
The bushfire and climate change debate, it's dumb, it's reckless, it's offensive.

432
00:29:01,560 --> 00:29:05,560
Now is not the time to be talking about climate change.

433
00:29:05,560 --> 00:29:08,640
So here's the problem the Australian Government faces.

434
00:29:08,640 --> 00:29:13,700
It has to run a tightrope between appeasing voters who are mostly calling for action and

435
00:29:13,700 --> 00:29:18,380
powerful members of its parliamentary party who either want to downplay the role of climate

436
00:29:18,380 --> 00:29:22,140
change or don't even accept the basic science.

437
00:29:22,140 --> 00:29:26,100
And this is the Deputy Prime Minister about to answer the question, do you agree that

438
00:29:26,100 --> 00:29:29,300
there needs to be further action on climate change?

439
00:29:29,300 --> 00:29:34,180
Now the answer is either yes or no, and saying no to taking action is never a good political

440
00:29:34,180 --> 00:29:39,800
move, but if he says yes, he knows the follow-up question is going to be, OK, what sort of

441
00:29:39,800 --> 00:29:42,640
further action will you take?

442
00:29:42,640 --> 00:29:47,120
When a politician knows an uncomfortable follow-up question is coming, he'll stall it at all

443
00:29:47,120 --> 00:29:51,640
costs by droning on at length about other topics without pausing for a breath so the

444
00:29:51,640 --> 00:29:54,560
reporters have no chance of interrupting to ask the question again.

445
00:29:54,560 --> 00:29:56,760
Let's watch the masterclass in how that's done.

446
00:29:56,760 --> 00:30:01,000
There's been a lot of hysteria around climate change.

447
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:03,860
Climate change isn't the only factor that has caused these fires.

448
00:30:03,860 --> 00:30:09,140
There's been dry lightning strikes, there's been self-combusting piles of manure, there's

449
00:30:09,140 --> 00:30:10,860
been a lot of arsonists out there.

450
00:30:10,860 --> 00:30:13,100
Ah, throw in the arsonist excuse.

451
00:30:13,100 --> 00:30:14,100
Good.

452
00:30:14,100 --> 00:30:15,300
You can use up to a minute on that.

453
00:30:15,300 --> 00:30:20,320
Somebody who is deliberately lighting a fire to cause mischief indeed, potentially property

454
00:30:20,320 --> 00:30:25,620
damage and even death, should be dobbed in to Crimestoppers on 1800 333 000.

455
00:30:25,620 --> 00:30:28,020
And if somebody sees a fire...

456
00:30:28,040 --> 00:30:32,660
The reason a politician rambles on like this is not because he's forgotten the question.

457
00:30:32,660 --> 00:30:37,560
He's hoping the reporter will forget the question and instead follow something else the politician

458
00:30:37,560 --> 00:30:39,840
mentions in his diatribe.

459
00:30:39,840 --> 00:30:42,520
Or he's hoping to simply run down the clock.

460
00:30:42,520 --> 00:30:47,400
The journalist would have been told by a ministerial aide that this is only a ten minute doorstop

461
00:30:47,400 --> 00:30:51,240
and on the ten minute mark the aide will step in and tell the minister he's expected at

462
00:30:51,240 --> 00:30:52,720
his next appointment.

463
00:30:52,720 --> 00:30:56,640
So all the politician has to do is keep talking.

464
00:30:56,640 --> 00:30:57,640
How's he getting on?

465
00:30:57,640 --> 00:31:00,900
A person in authority that they actually heed those warnings.

466
00:31:00,900 --> 00:31:01,900
Fire...

467
00:31:01,900 --> 00:31:05,900
But I'll put you out of your misery.

468
00:31:05,900 --> 00:31:10,580
When he eventually stopped talking the reporter asked exactly the same question again and

469
00:31:10,580 --> 00:31:14,820
the Deputy Prime Minister was forced to admit that more needed to be done.

470
00:31:14,820 --> 00:31:18,940
But of course the government's argument is there's no point because there's nothing we

471
00:31:18,940 --> 00:31:21,060
can do about it anyway.

472
00:31:21,060 --> 00:31:27,220
Australia is responsible for just 1.3% of global emissions.

473
00:31:27,220 --> 00:31:34,240
The real problem it seems was that the Morrison government hadn't magically turned down the

474
00:31:34,240 --> 00:31:38,220
world's temperature by cutting Australia's tiny emissions.

475
00:31:38,220 --> 00:31:43,780
And even if the entire planet turned carbon neutral tomorrow we would still have summers

476
00:31:43,780 --> 00:31:47,440
like this, we would still have fires like this.

477
00:31:47,440 --> 00:31:49,620
For once the experts agree.

478
00:31:49,620 --> 00:31:55,120
Taking action on CO2 emissions now won't stop the mega fires we're dealing with now.

479
00:31:55,120 --> 00:32:00,440
The time to have taken action to avoid today's mega fires was in the 1980s when the world's

480
00:32:00,440 --> 00:32:03,960
politicians first recognised the problem.

481
00:32:03,960 --> 00:32:07,820
But they decided to kick the can down the road because they knew that the effects of

482
00:32:07,820 --> 00:32:13,420
any CO2 reduction policies they took then would be decades away and they were more concerned

483
00:32:13,420 --> 00:32:15,980
about the next general election.

484
00:32:15,980 --> 00:32:19,060
And government politicians are doing the same thing today.

485
00:32:19,060 --> 00:32:24,920
The effects of any policies they introduce now won't be felt for another 30 years.

486
00:32:24,920 --> 00:32:28,340
And their political careers will be over by then.

487
00:32:28,340 --> 00:32:33,660
When the fires abate at the end of this season and this drought finally ends, as it inevitably

488
00:32:33,660 --> 00:32:37,220
will, they can proclaim that the crisis is over.

489
00:32:37,220 --> 00:32:42,200
As droughts, heatwaves and mega fires continue to become more frequent and more intense they'll

490
00:32:42,200 --> 00:32:45,520
just hope it'll be someone else's problem.

491
00:32:45,520 --> 00:32:52,260
As for the argument that Australia only contributes 1.3% of anthropogenic CO2, that's also true.

492
00:32:52,260 --> 00:32:56,700
Even if Australia stopped emitting CO2 altogether it would make very little difference to the

493
00:32:56,700 --> 00:32:59,240
global warming trend.

494
00:32:59,240 --> 00:33:06,440
But France is only responsible for 0.9% of the world's CO2 emissions, Germany 2.1%, Japan

495
00:33:06,440 --> 00:33:08,680
3.6%.

496
00:33:08,680 --> 00:33:13,160
If every country took a view that it doesn't have to do anything because its own CO2 emissions

497
00:33:13,160 --> 00:33:16,880
are just a fraction of the total, nothing would ever get done.

498
00:33:16,880 --> 00:33:19,720
We'd just expect China to do it alone.

499
00:33:19,720 --> 00:33:25,080
And China could then use the argument that its emissions per capita are only 7.7 tonnes

500
00:33:25,080 --> 00:33:28,480
a year, less than half those of Australia.

501
00:33:28,480 --> 00:33:33,980
So solving an international problem requires international cooperation.

502
00:33:33,980 --> 00:33:39,020
Australia has diplomatic clout in the world and shunning summit meetings on climate change

503
00:33:39,020 --> 00:33:44,760
and thwarting international climate agreements by demanding privileged loopholes is not making

504
00:33:44,760 --> 00:33:49,160
Australia popular and it isn't even in our own self-interest.

505
00:33:49,160 --> 00:33:53,600
This country stands to benefit more than most from the energy revolution.

506
00:33:53,600 --> 00:33:58,640
When an international agreement is made, South Korea and Japan want to build economies based

507
00:33:58,640 --> 00:34:05,200
on hydrogen fuel made in Australia because we have a wealth of clean, renewable energy.

508
00:34:05,200 --> 00:34:09,880
It's not going to cost us anything, but what is costing us is the result of government

509
00:34:09,880 --> 00:34:12,660
inaction 40 years ago.

510
00:34:12,660 --> 00:34:18,400
And there's nothing that Australia can or ever will do that will change the global climate.

511
00:34:18,400 --> 00:34:21,180
But of course, again, scientists disagree.

512
00:34:21,180 --> 00:34:28,920
Researchers since 1896 – 1896! – have shown conclusively that increasing CO2 concentration

513
00:34:28,920 --> 00:34:31,180
raises global temperature.

514
00:34:31,180 --> 00:34:36,540
To all those who doubt that, don't just read magazine stories, read the science.

515
00:34:36,540 --> 00:34:40,560
And scientific studies have been warning for decades that this is going to increase climatic

516
00:34:40,560 --> 00:34:44,400
extremes in Australia, including bushfires.

517
00:34:44,400 --> 00:34:48,840
So what scientists have been urging for the last four decades is that to mitigate these

518
00:34:48,840 --> 00:34:53,800
droughts, heatwaves and megafires, you need to reduce the concentration of the gas that's

519
00:34:53,800 --> 00:34:56,700
making them more and more extreme.

520
00:34:56,700 --> 00:35:00,000
So finally, what do I think is the cause of these bushfires?

521
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:02,100
Well, I'll tell you.

522
00:35:02,100 --> 00:35:03,840
It doesn't matter.

523
00:35:03,840 --> 00:35:09,160
Neither my amateur opinion nor the opinions of amateurs in videos, blogs, TV commentaries,

524
00:35:09,160 --> 00:35:13,920
pubs, clubs and knitting circles matter when it comes to science.

525
00:35:13,920 --> 00:35:18,580
Especially when all most amateurs are doing is simply quoting from each other and passing

526
00:35:18,580 --> 00:35:22,420
round nonsense beliefs that's at variance with the facts.

527
00:35:22,420 --> 00:35:26,400
So I'm going to leave the last word with one of those researchers.

528
00:35:26,400 --> 00:35:32,120
I don't want to say, I told you so, no climate scientist does, but that kind of sits there.

529
00:35:32,120 --> 00:35:34,740
You're like, well, this is not a surprise to us.

530
00:35:34,740 --> 00:35:38,880
It's still utterly devastating and it breaks my heart to see my country on fire.

531
00:35:38,880 --> 00:35:39,880
It really does.

532
00:35:39,880 --> 00:35:42,720
It was just a matter of time when this perfect storm happened.

533
00:35:42,720 --> 00:35:47,120
And the thing is, as we move further into the future and the climate warms even more,

534
00:35:47,120 --> 00:35:48,320
what's going to happen then?

535
00:35:48,320 --> 00:35:50,840
Sure, climate variability will have a role.

536
00:35:50,840 --> 00:35:51,840
It always has a role.

537
00:35:51,840 --> 00:35:57,760
But if it's two or three degrees hotter, not just one degree hotter, how bad can it really

538
00:35:57,760 --> 00:35:58,760
get?

539
00:35:58,760 --> 00:36:00,560
And I guess that's what concerns me the most.

540
00:36:00,560 --> 00:36:02,800
Not how bad it is now, but how bad it will be in the future.
