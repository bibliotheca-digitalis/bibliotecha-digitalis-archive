00:00.000 --> 00:05.900
Make no mistake, the tragedy unfolding in Australia is climate change based.

00:05.900 --> 00:10.380
Well perhaps that's a conclusion best left to the experts, rather than an acceptance

00:10.380 --> 00:12.580
speech at the Golden Globes.

00:12.580 --> 00:17.620
So let's hear the scientific conclusion from Australia's leading climate scientist.

00:17.620 --> 00:20.300
Climate change isn't the cause of these bushfires.

00:20.300 --> 00:25.520
Wait, my mistake, this isn't Australia's leading climate scientist, it's plain old TV commentator

00:25.520 --> 00:28.900
Peter Credlin, also not an expert.

00:29.160 --> 00:33.640
Aren't there any real researchers out there who can give us an expert conclusion?

00:33.640 --> 00:37.880
We seem to be inundated with pundits all over the world who've suddenly found Australia

00:37.880 --> 00:44.540
on a map and decided that after five minutes surfing the internet they know what's causing

00:44.540 --> 00:50.320
the bushfires and of course they think we're in dire need of their McExpert opinion.

00:50.320 --> 00:54.640
So let me start by saying that I'm no more of an expert than they are, so I'm not going

00:54.640 --> 00:58.640
to set myself up as one or make up my own theories.

00:58.640 --> 01:01.960
As always, I'm going to report the science.

01:01.960 --> 01:07.840
The real experts will tell you that the link between climate change and bushfires is complicated.

01:07.840 --> 01:11.460
But let's look at this through the eyes of the amateurs and take a closer look at what

01:11.460 --> 01:17.260
the science says in response, starting with the excuse that we're not seeing anything new.

01:17.260 --> 01:24.420
Nothing to see here, please, experts, nothing to see here, please.

01:24.420 --> 01:30.740
See that this nation, this state, has seen similar conditions and similar disasters many,

01:30.740 --> 01:32.360
many times over.

01:32.360 --> 01:36.540
The fact none of these bushfires were in any way extraordinary compared to not just the

01:36.540 --> 01:42.500
last 50 years but indeed the last 150 years was an inconvenient truth.

01:42.500 --> 01:46.800
Yes, apparently it's the normal climate of Australia.

01:46.800 --> 01:50.260
Not exactly a new phenomenon in Australia.

01:50.260 --> 01:55.140
And of course that's true, Australia has always had bushfires, droughts and heatwaves.

01:55.140 --> 01:59.900
I think you'd be hard-pressed to find a single scientific study that disagrees.

01:59.900 --> 02:04.460
But what climate researchers want to know, and I would have thought this was pretty obvious,

02:04.460 --> 02:09.020
is whether temperatures have been rising and whether the heatwaves, droughts and fires

02:09.020 --> 02:11.020
have been getting worse.

02:11.020 --> 02:15.900
One way to find out if it was hotter in the past is to go back over old newspaper clippings

02:15.900 --> 02:20.540
and see if you can find heatwaves or very hot days on different dates in different parts

02:20.540 --> 02:21.540
of the country.

02:21.540 --> 02:25.460
Now let's look at an Australian heatwave which occurred 80 years ago.

02:25.460 --> 02:29.500
They're easy to find, but of course they don't tell us much.

02:29.500 --> 02:35.100
Australia is a huge continent, so cherry-picking a record temperature in one particular town

02:35.100 --> 02:39.600
doesn't tell you what's happening in the rest of the country or the rest of that year, let

02:39.600 --> 02:42.140
alone over several decades.

02:42.140 --> 02:44.960
That's why experts don't do it that way.

02:44.960 --> 02:50.680
They take national annual averages and build up a complete picture.

02:50.680 --> 02:55.620
And by including all the data, this is the complete picture, and right away you can see

02:55.620 --> 02:58.200
the obvious warming trend.

02:58.200 --> 03:03.520
This reconstruction from Berkeley Earth shows a 12-month moving average in grey and a 10-year

03:03.520 --> 03:08.780
moving average in red, and this one, which is a straight plot of average annual temperatures

03:08.780 --> 03:12.520
over time, comes from the Bureau of Meteorology.

03:12.520 --> 03:20.120
And that's how the BOM determined that December 17th 2019 was the hottest day on record thus far.

03:20.120 --> 03:24.620
So when BOM says it was the hottest day on record, what exactly does that mean?

03:24.620 --> 03:28.400
Does that mean going back 20 years, 30 years, 50 years?

03:28.400 --> 03:32.480
Well it means that the average temperature across the whole country, taking data from

03:32.480 --> 03:38.440
all the weather stations, shows that up to that time, December 17th 2019 was the hottest

03:38.440 --> 03:40.080
on record.

03:40.080 --> 03:46.620
And since the Bureau of Meteorology's records began in 1910, that means since 1910, unless

03:46.620 --> 03:48.720
the BOM specifies otherwise.

03:48.720 --> 03:52.720
The Bureau of Meteorology's claiming that Australia's hottest day on record came on

03:52.720 --> 03:57.620
a day when BOREC was 24 degrees below their all-time record maximum.

03:57.620 --> 03:59.520
That doesn't sound very credible to me.

03:59.520 --> 04:04.340
Yeah, but that's why this data analysis is best left to qualified professionals.

04:04.340 --> 04:09.100
A record high average doesn't mean that every single weather station has to hit a record

04:09.140 --> 04:11.620
high temperature on that day.

04:11.620 --> 04:17.100
It means that the average of all the weather stations is at a record high.

04:17.100 --> 04:20.580
Most will be below their individual all-time highs.

04:20.580 --> 04:25.620
That's especially true of BOREC, which unofficially recorded Australia's hottest ever temperature

04:25.620 --> 04:29.840
of 51.7 degrees centigrade in 1909.

04:29.840 --> 04:34.540
The reading is thought to be a mistake, but even if it's accurate, BOREC is very unlikely

04:34.540 --> 04:40.340
to match that record just because Australia's national average hits a record high.

04:40.340 --> 04:42.500
Climate doesn't work that way.

04:42.500 --> 04:47.140
It's a big continent, and on that particular day the south-east of Australia, including

04:47.140 --> 04:51.900
BOREC, was influenced by a weather front in the Tasman Sea, and temperatures were mostly

04:51.900 --> 04:54.080
below average.

04:54.080 --> 04:56.540
Temperatures haven't been significantly higher either.

04:56.540 --> 05:03.220
In fact, during the years 1899 to 1901, average December mean maximum temperatures were well

05:03.260 --> 05:05.740
above 38 degrees.

05:05.740 --> 05:09.000
But why not read the caption on your own graph?

05:09.000 --> 05:11.780
This isn't the mean temperature for Australia.

05:11.780 --> 05:14.220
It's the data from just one weather station.

05:14.220 --> 05:18.280
Don't they teach the concept of averages in schools any more?

05:18.280 --> 05:23.700
You have to look at the average annual temperature data, not just cherry-pick one place in one

05:23.700 --> 05:26.960
month that gives you the result you want.

05:26.960 --> 05:31.260
The only way you can dismiss this pretty clear temperature rise is to believe that there's

05:31.260 --> 05:36.460
a conspiracy to cook up fraudulent figures and somehow hide the real ones.

05:36.460 --> 05:41.020
Note that the weather girl is cleverly standing in front of eastern Australia, and it wasn't

05:41.020 --> 05:43.860
particularly hot over there on December 17th.

05:43.860 --> 05:48.740
So that's how they hide below average temperatures, by sticking a weather girl in front of them.

05:48.740 --> 05:51.700
What a cunning plan, simple yet brilliant.

05:51.700 --> 05:55.960
I guess from now on I'll check the weather the way most Aussies do, from the numerous

05:55.960 --> 06:00.980
TV forecasts we get every day where weather presenters can't get in the way, well unless

06:00.980 --> 06:03.940
you live in Mexico where it's unavoidable.

06:03.940 --> 06:06.020
Time for hide the data plan B.

06:06.020 --> 06:09.820
But if we look at the Bureau of Meteorology's temperature graph for Australia, you can see

06:09.820 --> 06:12.100
they begin in 1910.

06:12.100 --> 06:15.800
They hide all of the extremely hot weather which occurred prior to then.

06:15.800 --> 06:20.100
What certainly sounds devious, but instead of jumping straight to the conclusion that

06:20.100 --> 06:24.040
there's a conspiracy, why not simply find out the reason?

06:24.040 --> 06:27.860
It only requires a little bit of effort because the answer's right there on the Bureau of

06:27.860 --> 06:29.840
Meteorology website.

06:29.840 --> 06:36.740
The BOM didn't have any data before 1910 because it only started operations in 1908.

06:36.740 --> 06:40.720
And while your next question will probably be, why didn't they show other data that

06:40.720 --> 06:45.880
had been collected before they were founded, the answer to that is also pretty easy.

06:45.880 --> 06:46.900
They do.

06:46.900 --> 06:52.080
The data for all the stations prior to 1910 is freely available on the Bureau of Meteorology

06:52.080 --> 06:53.080
website.

06:53.080 --> 06:57.920
In fact, we've already seen one, and there's also an historical reconstruction based on

06:57.920 --> 07:03.080
that data, also on the BOM website compiled by Berkeley Earth.

07:03.080 --> 07:09.080
The problem, as you can see, is that the readings have huge margins of error prior to 1910 because

07:09.080 --> 07:11.840
there was no standardisation.

07:11.840 --> 07:16.200
Weather stations were using different instruments, taking readings at different times of day

07:16.200 --> 07:18.400
and under different conditions.

07:18.400 --> 07:23.740
So as soon as it was founded, the BOM standardised meteorological instruments and data gathering

07:23.740 --> 07:26.960
techniques all across Australia.

07:26.960 --> 07:31.760
So while the Bureau of Meteorology is happy to put all this pre-1910 data on its website

07:31.760 --> 07:37.000
for you to download, as well as reconstructions that use it, it does so with a warning that

07:37.000 --> 07:39.360
the data is not reliable.

07:39.360 --> 07:44.800
That's why it starts its own official records from the year of standardisation, 1910.

07:44.800 --> 07:48.880
Actually, let's just get back to that page from their website.

07:48.880 --> 07:53.680
If you look at the value on the right hand side, just after the year 2000, notice how

07:53.680 --> 07:54.680
that…what?

07:54.680 --> 07:57.520
They're hiding the figures!

07:57.520 --> 07:58.520
Not again!

07:58.520 --> 08:02.120
Damn your cunning tricks, Bureau of Meteorology!

08:02.120 --> 08:05.440
So obviously I can't show you that, but let's go on and look at the drought.

08:05.440 --> 08:10.120
It's a hard one to define because there are so many different ways of measuring it.

08:10.120 --> 08:15.240
But if we take rainfall alone, there's no evidence that Australia is getting less rain

08:15.240 --> 08:17.040
and no reason why it should.

08:17.040 --> 08:20.800
What's happening is that rainfall patterns are changing.

08:20.800 --> 08:25.960
If we start looking at patterns from 1950, about the time temperatures began rising,

08:25.960 --> 08:30.760
eastern and southwestern parts of Australia, which are the big population and agricultural

08:30.760 --> 08:36.760
centres seem to be getting drier, while the north and northwest are getting wetter.

08:36.760 --> 08:40.560
And that's being confirmed by scientific studies, which we'll look at more closely

08:40.560 --> 08:42.600
later in the video.

08:42.600 --> 08:46.880
So that brings us on to the most relevant trend, the fires themselves.

08:46.880 --> 08:51.400
Is the 2019-2020 fire season perfectly normal?

08:51.400 --> 08:57.520
Australia's acting and retired fire chiefs, each with a lifetime experience fighting bushfires,

08:57.520 --> 09:01.800
came together to warn the government, no, this is not normal.

09:01.800 --> 09:07.320
Never before have we had 17 concurrent emergency warning fires burning at once.

09:07.320 --> 09:09.160
So there's something going on.

09:09.160 --> 09:11.720
And that's supported by scientific studies.

09:11.720 --> 09:17.320
The best way to quantify this is to look at the FFDI, the Forest Fire Danger Index,

09:17.320 --> 09:22.520
which measures the likelihood of fires breaking out based on rainfall, evaporation, humidity,

09:22.520 --> 09:24.880
temperature and other factors.

09:24.880 --> 09:29.600
At least two studies have shown that the FFDI has been trending upwards.

09:29.600 --> 09:34.400
This 2007 study is interesting because it not only found that the FFDI rose for the

09:34.400 --> 09:39.920
previous three decades, but it predicted that fire weather conditions would worsen, increasing

09:39.920 --> 09:44.760
the FFDI between 4 and 25 per cent by 2020.

09:44.760 --> 09:46.360
That's now.

09:46.360 --> 09:50.960
And this study found that the FFDI increased significantly in nearly half the stations

09:50.960 --> 09:57.280
it checked between 1973 and 2010, a clear upward trend.

09:57.280 --> 10:00.960
All of which means, yes, there is something to see here.

10:00.960 --> 10:06.800
So the next excuse is, but it's not climate change, it's arsonists.

10:06.800 --> 10:09.920
What was the heart, the arson element of this story?

10:09.920 --> 10:10.920
That was my question.

10:10.920 --> 10:11.920
Oh, my God.

10:11.920 --> 10:14.980
Now we've got five bloody armchair experts.

10:14.980 --> 10:16.160
It's hard to tell what's true or not.

10:16.160 --> 10:21.080
I see pictures of people who allegedly set the fires and they're running away and there's

10:21.080 --> 10:26.160
50 people in jail on charges of arson or something in Australia.

10:26.160 --> 10:28.160
But, you know, they've been charged.

10:28.160 --> 10:30.040
But have they been found guilty yet?

10:30.040 --> 10:31.040
I don't know.

10:31.040 --> 10:34.680
Aren't some of the arsonists climate nutters, though, as well?

10:34.680 --> 10:37.960
Guess what the primary cause of these fires was?

10:37.960 --> 10:40.520
People deliberately starting the fires.

10:40.520 --> 10:43.320
Now that may be true, but it isn't.

10:43.320 --> 10:45.520
You can't just make stuff up out of thin air.

10:45.520 --> 10:47.760
You have to check the figures.

10:47.760 --> 10:54.360
According to the Australian Institute of Criminology, from September 2019 to December 2019, which

10:54.360 --> 10:59.640
was when you decided we needed the benefit of your McExpert opinion, only around 13 per

10:59.640 --> 11:02.340
cent of fires were started by arson.

11:02.340 --> 11:04.900
That's hardly the primary cause.

11:04.900 --> 11:10.340
It's possible many of the 36 per cent of fires deemed suspicious may turn out to be arson.

11:10.340 --> 11:11.340
We don't know.

11:11.340 --> 11:15.860
And there's loads of articles talking about how now the fires are being blamed on arsonists.

11:15.860 --> 11:19.300
I'm sure there are, but that doesn't mean it's true.

11:19.300 --> 11:23.880
James Delingpole, a columnist for Breitbart News who never studied science past playing

11:23.880 --> 11:29.000
with Newton's balls at prep school, thinks there are 180 arsonists.

11:29.000 --> 11:33.720
This guy thinks there are 183 arsonists, and he even knows the political philosophy

11:33.720 --> 11:35.120
of everyone.

11:35.120 --> 11:37.840
Apparently they're all leftists.

11:37.840 --> 11:43.880
This figure, either 183, more than 180 or nearly 200, has been going round the blogosphere

11:43.880 --> 11:49.480
so many times that Donald Trump Jr picked up on it and tweeted it to thousands of his

11:49.480 --> 11:50.480
followers.

11:50.480 --> 11:53.160
In Australia, it's known as a furphy.

11:53.160 --> 11:58.720
Or to put it in words that the McExperts understand, it's all total bullshit.

11:58.720 --> 12:00.760
So where does this figure come from?

12:00.760 --> 12:06.160
Well, it started with a completely false headline in the Australian newspaper.

12:06.160 --> 12:11.380
Firebugs fuelling crisis as national arson arrest toll hits 183.

12:11.380 --> 12:17.600
The Australian is published by Rupert Murdoch, so accuracy is not exactly a priority.

12:17.600 --> 12:24.080
The Australian cites its source as a NSW police report, so let's go to the source and, yes,

12:24.080 --> 12:29.200
your way ahead of me, discover how the headline writers got it wrong.

12:29.200 --> 12:35.480
Turns out these weren't 183 cases of arson, they were 183 cases of fire-related incidents

12:35.480 --> 12:37.320
in NSW.

12:37.320 --> 12:42.560
Only 24 people were charged with arson, 57 had legal action, which could be as simple

12:42.560 --> 12:48.260
as a caution, for failing to comply with the total fire ban, for example by lighting campfires

12:48.260 --> 12:54.160
or barbecues or even operating machinery in areas where a fire ban is in place.

12:54.160 --> 12:59.980
And 47 were cautioned or charged with discarding matches or lit cigarettes on the ground.

12:59.980 --> 13:07.140
So 24 alleged arsonists gets bumped up to 183 and then rounded up to nearly 200.

13:07.140 --> 13:11.780
You have to read past the fake headlines to see the actual figures buried in the body

13:11.780 --> 13:17.240
of these stories, which of course most armchair experts can't be bothered to do.

13:17.240 --> 13:23.200
But OK, even 24 of these huge fires is nothing to scoff at, and there are many more suspected

13:23.200 --> 13:27.460
arson attacks where the perpetrators haven't been caught.

13:27.460 --> 13:32.720
But it turns out that arsonists aren't responsible for most of these big fires.

13:32.720 --> 13:38.120
According to the experts, remember them, the most common cause is not arson or discarded

13:38.120 --> 13:43.880
cigarettes or any form of human activity, the most common cause by far is lightning

13:43.880 --> 13:45.520
strikes.

13:45.840 --> 13:49.440
Inspector Ben Sheppard of the NSW Rural Fire Service said,

13:49.440 --> 13:53.640
I can confidently say the majority of larger fires we've been dealing with have been

13:53.640 --> 13:59.400
the result of fires coming out of remote areas as a result of dry lightning storms.

13:59.400 --> 14:03.680
According to Brett Mitchell, CFA Incident Controller in Bairnsdale, East Gippsland,

14:03.680 --> 14:09.080
where some of the worst fires occurred, most of the fires have been caused by lightning.

14:09.080 --> 14:14.040
And Victoria's Fire Chief says dry lightning, not arson, is the main cause of the state's

14:14.040 --> 14:16.280
destructive bushfires.

14:16.280 --> 14:21.860
But how can that be, you ask, if the statistics I've just quoted show that natural causes

14:21.860 --> 14:28.200
like lightning strikes are only responsible for starting about 6% of the fires?

14:28.200 --> 14:30.820
Well because not all fires are equal.

14:30.820 --> 14:35.240
One fire might be huge, another might be tiny.

14:35.240 --> 14:40.240
Most fires started accidentally or deliberately by humans are quickly spotted and in places

14:40.240 --> 14:43.600
that are easily accessible to fire trucks.

14:43.600 --> 14:48.280
Fires from lightning strikes tend to start in remote areas of thick forest and bushland

14:48.280 --> 14:52.520
where there's lots of fuel and they're hard to reach, and hard to control.

14:52.520 --> 14:57.280
They're the ones burning up millions of acres of forest and becoming unstoppable as

14:57.280 --> 14:59.080
they advance on small towns.

14:59.080 --> 15:03.520
That's why the Fire Chiefs are saying, it's lightning that's responsible for these

15:03.520 --> 15:05.720
large fires.

15:05.720 --> 15:10.840
Most arson offences relate to small grass fires and things like rubbish bins set alight.

15:10.840 --> 15:17.900
In Victoria, only about 0.03% of the millions of acres burned was due to arson.

15:17.900 --> 15:22.440
And none of South Australia's deadliest or most destructive fires are being treated

15:22.440 --> 15:24.440
as suspicious.

15:24.440 --> 15:29.320
That doesn't mean to say arson isn't a serious problem, arsonists are a bloody menace

15:29.320 --> 15:34.000
and sometimes they are responsible for destroying homes and even killing people.

15:34.000 --> 15:36.560
But unfortunately they're nothing new.

15:36.560 --> 15:40.740
What's different between this season and last season is not the sudden appearance of

15:40.740 --> 15:46.120
an army of arsonists, but a long period of drought, record high air temperature and a

15:46.120 --> 15:51.180
higher forest fire danger index, which are all part of a growing trend.

15:51.180 --> 15:56.180
So when lightning strikes, these hot dry forests erupt in flame.

15:56.180 --> 16:01.080
So the objective of this disinformation campaign seems to be to take attention away from these

16:01.080 --> 16:06.540
worsening fire conditions and blame Australians themselves for starting these fires, which

16:06.540 --> 16:10.180
is not only misleading, but insulting.

16:10.180 --> 16:13.820
And if that doesn't work, we'll find someone else to blame.

16:13.820 --> 16:17.140
OK, so who knows about this?

16:17.140 --> 16:18.760
Oh, I have something.

16:18.760 --> 16:21.780
I think you can guess this isn't going to turn out well.

16:21.780 --> 16:28.740
I was reading a paper the other day and one of the stories was about how actually the

16:28.740 --> 16:33.540
reason that the fires are getting so bad is they stopped doing controlled burns.

16:33.540 --> 16:38.980
Yeah, yeah, that's a classic example of land management issue, isn't it?

16:38.980 --> 16:42.040
They're not clearing the end of growth, they're not doing controlled burns.

16:42.040 --> 16:47.120
Because green environmentalist policies have outlawed property owners doing controlled

16:47.120 --> 16:52.060
burns that create firebreaks to prevent inferno spreading.

16:52.060 --> 16:56.680
What's happening is radical left-wing environmentalists in Australia are stopping the country from

16:56.680 --> 17:01.420
conducting the controlled burns it needs to keep these wildfires from happening.

17:01.420 --> 17:06.100
Turns out he's referencing a Breitbart News op-ed by our old friend James Delingpole,

17:06.100 --> 17:07.900
the political commentator.

17:07.900 --> 17:10.980
And it got passed around the internet by everybody else.

17:10.980 --> 17:15.740
So let's inject a few facts into this maelstrom of ignogeneous ignorance.

17:15.740 --> 17:21.520
Firstly, the Green Party, which is pretty representative of the Greenies in Australia,

17:21.520 --> 17:23.120
supports prescribed burns.

17:23.120 --> 17:24.980
It says so in its manifesto.

17:24.980 --> 17:29.780
Secondly, the fire chiefs, and in case you've forgotten, they are the experts, not the POMI

17:29.780 --> 17:33.280
politicos, say this is not a problem they face.

17:33.280 --> 17:38.880
The single biggest impediment to completing hazard reduction burning is the weather.

17:38.880 --> 17:44.820
And with longer fire seasons, earlier starts and later finishes to fire seasons, like we've

17:44.820 --> 17:50.440
been experiencing over recent times, you get a shrinking window of opportunity for more

17:50.440 --> 17:52.840
favourable hazard reduction burning periods.

17:52.840 --> 17:59.320
And in that shrinking window you get the extremes of it can be too wet and too cold to effectively

17:59.320 --> 18:05.200
get hazard reduction burns done through to it being too hot and too dry and therefore

18:05.200 --> 18:06.200
too dangerous.

18:06.200 --> 18:11.120
Look, it's very clear, and any fire service will tell you, that the windows for hazard

18:11.120 --> 18:14.680
reduction through the winter are getting narrower and narrower.

18:14.680 --> 18:19.500
Now, a slight lift in temperature overall, average temperature, means the extremes are

18:19.500 --> 18:22.020
more extreme.

18:22.020 --> 18:24.640
We can't light a burn and just let it run.

18:24.640 --> 18:27.240
Lighting a hazard reduction burn is complicated.

18:27.240 --> 18:28.520
It's resource hungry.

18:28.520 --> 18:29.700
It's risky.

18:29.700 --> 18:34.360
And the minute we see a burn lit, I end up getting inundated with claims for people wanting

18:34.360 --> 18:37.600
us to pay for their shade cloth on their greenhouse.

18:37.600 --> 18:41.760
The suntough on their back pergola has now got embers that have landed on it.

18:41.760 --> 18:46.720
So there's so many ramifications that come from prescribed burning.

18:46.720 --> 18:52.580
Hazard reduction has a place and is a valuable tool for day-to-day fires, for normal seasons.

18:52.580 --> 18:56.400
But when you've got a really tough season, when you've got awful fire weather conditions,

18:56.400 --> 19:01.200
so when you're running fires under severe extreme or worse conditions, hazard reduction

19:01.200 --> 19:04.760
has very little effect at all on fire spread.

19:04.760 --> 19:10.640
It's only when the conditions back off a little bit, generally speaking overnight, or when

19:10.640 --> 19:15.020
the severe extreme or catastrophic conditions get right back to, say, very high, that you've

19:15.020 --> 19:18.080
actually got some prospect of slowing the fire spread.

19:18.080 --> 19:22.600
So it's important, but not the panacea, and something that we should have a very open

19:22.600 --> 19:24.600
and frank discussion about.

19:24.600 --> 19:28.440
The other point here is about all the emotion around these fuel reduction burns.

19:28.440 --> 19:34.160
The reality is, I am concerned, and it's interesting now, my peer in New South Wales has come out

19:34.160 --> 19:38.920
quite strongly, Shane Fitzsimmons, and said exactly the same thing, which is essentially,

19:38.920 --> 19:42.600
we can't see these fuel reduction burns as a silver bullet.

19:42.600 --> 19:47.980
Yes, we need to do fuel reduction burns, but they're not going to solve all our problems.

19:47.980 --> 19:52.560
So an example in Gippsland, where we had a fuel reduction burn go through in 2014, didn't

19:52.560 --> 19:54.340
slow this fire up at all.

19:54.340 --> 19:59.380
And I can say, in any given year, of all the burns that we've got ready to go, 70 or 80

19:59.380 --> 20:01.540
per cent are cleared, environmentally ready to go.

20:01.540 --> 20:04.100
We're just waiting for the window of opportunity.

20:04.100 --> 20:09.380
We've gone from completing, lucky to be 40 or 50 per cent of our annual burn programs,

20:09.380 --> 20:12.000
to now up to 80 or 90 per cent of our burn programs.

20:12.000 --> 20:15.620
And according to the New South Wales Department of Planning, Industry and Environment, the

20:15.620 --> 20:21.140
main reason for the increase is not the successful quashing of greeny protests, but increased

20:21.140 --> 20:24.260
funding for the crews that do this hazard reduction work.

20:24.260 --> 20:26.100
Sorry, carry on, Shane.

20:26.100 --> 20:30.020
If there's a risk in an area and it needs treating with hazard reduction work, we can

20:30.020 --> 20:34.460
serve notices on private and public landholders to get that work done.

20:34.460 --> 20:39.580
Yes, burning is important, but some of the hysteria that this will be the problem that

20:39.580 --> 20:44.300
solves or the solution to all our problems is really just quite an emotional load of

20:44.300 --> 20:45.860
rubbish to be honest.

20:45.860 --> 20:47.660
The figures back all that up.

20:47.660 --> 20:52.120
In its most recent annual report, the New South Wales Rural Fire Service said it had

20:52.120 --> 20:59.300
planned 19,896 prescribed burns and carried out 16,556 of them.

20:59.300 --> 21:01.340
That's 83 per cent.

21:01.340 --> 21:05.680
I'm sure people will post anecdotal tales on the forum of how they weren't allowed to

21:05.680 --> 21:10.820
remove trees or burn bush on their own properties, but every council is different.

21:10.820 --> 21:13.120
Every neighbourhood is different.

21:13.120 --> 21:15.380
This is the view from my backyard.

21:15.380 --> 21:20.440
We've had to evacuate twice as forest fires got close, so I'd love to do a prescribed

21:20.440 --> 21:25.140
burn every couple of years in our wooded area that backs onto a national forest, or have

21:25.140 --> 21:27.620
the fire service come in and do it.

21:27.620 --> 21:32.360
But even if conditions were right during the short time period available between ever lengthening

21:32.360 --> 21:37.060
fire seasons, the biggest objections would come from my neighbours.

21:37.060 --> 21:40.840
Not because they're greenies, but because they're worried that a prescribed burn might

21:40.840 --> 21:44.980
get out of control and destroy their half million dollar houses.

21:44.980 --> 21:46.960
That does happen.

21:46.960 --> 21:52.720
Regardless of individual cases, what these trained and experienced fire chiefs are explaining

21:52.720 --> 21:57.940
is the overall picture of the difficulties they face in carrying out prescribed burns,

21:57.940 --> 22:03.520
the success they've had despite these difficulties, the increased rates of hazard reduction, the

22:03.520 --> 22:08.200
fact that these prescribed burns aren't a panacea anyway, and their frustration at the

22:08.200 --> 22:12.560
way armchair critics are getting emotional over the issue rather than looking at the

22:12.560 --> 22:14.320
facts.

22:14.320 --> 22:18.740
And when the blame game runs out, it's finally time to face the question of whether climate

22:18.740 --> 22:21.900
change might be contributing to this.

22:21.900 --> 22:25.660
If you're into science and facts, you have to accept that the nation's most pre-eminent

22:25.660 --> 22:30.280
experts say there's no direct link between this drought and climate change.

22:30.280 --> 22:32.180
There's no long-term drying trend.

22:32.180 --> 22:34.540
Now the first part of that is true.

22:34.540 --> 22:38.900
Most experts say you can't attribute a single drought or a single weather event to climate

22:38.900 --> 22:40.300
change.

22:40.300 --> 22:44.840
For example, let's hear from Sarah Perkins Kirkpatrick, a senior researcher on climate

22:44.840 --> 22:46.880
at the University of New South Wales.

22:46.880 --> 22:51.020
So the last few winters we've had really low rainfall, and that's obviously what's ignited

22:51.020 --> 22:54.960
the drought and it's, you know, perpetuated for that amount of time, but we can't really

22:54.960 --> 22:58.680
find a signal due to natural variability in there, nor climate change.

22:58.680 --> 23:01.260
It's not to say neither of one of those is driving it.

23:01.260 --> 23:05.160
It's just not as obvious as what we would expect it to be.

23:05.160 --> 23:07.280
But the second part of Sky News's claim…

23:07.280 --> 23:11.780
The nation's most pre-eminent experts say there's no long-term drying trend.

23:11.780 --> 23:13.680
… is incorrect.

23:13.680 --> 23:17.780
Here are some of the nation's most pre-eminent climate experts, and that's exactly what

23:17.780 --> 23:19.100
they say.

23:19.100 --> 23:23.780
They condense their published research into a report in plain language that even arts

23:23.780 --> 23:27.080
graduates and political commentators can understand.

23:27.080 --> 23:32.580
Climate change is likely making drought conditions in south-west and south-east Australia worse.

23:32.580 --> 23:36.540
In Australia it's clear that climate change has reduced rainfall in the south-east and

23:36.540 --> 23:38.920
south-west corners of the continent.

23:38.920 --> 23:43.440
Precipitation patterns have changed markedly over the past two decades, with a pronounced

23:43.440 --> 23:46.920
drying trend in these two important agricultural regions.

23:46.920 --> 23:49.880
So which experts is he getting his information from?

23:49.880 --> 23:56.400
Well I listen to scientists and my key source is Professor Andy Pitman, who's a world-renowned

23:56.400 --> 23:57.920
expert in this area.

23:57.920 --> 24:03.160
Well maybe you're either not listening to Dr Pitman, or you don't understand his research.

24:03.160 --> 24:08.060
In plain language Dr Pitman says higher temperatures don't lead directly to higher evaporation

24:08.060 --> 24:12.860
and a higher risk of drought, but he says they do lead to changes in rainfall patterns

24:12.860 --> 24:14.920
which can lead to drought.

24:14.920 --> 24:19.860
In some regions, says Dr Pitman, global warming increases the risk of drought, and in other

24:19.860 --> 24:24.740
regions it decreases the risk, as we've already seen.

24:24.740 --> 24:29.300
Even the Australian Research Council's Centre of Excellence for Climate Extremes, where

24:29.300 --> 24:36.200
Dr Pitman is director, had to issue a media release telling these TV and newspaper McExperts

24:36.200 --> 24:39.120
to stop misrepresenting him.

24:39.120 --> 24:43.480
Stop claiming our scientists and director Andy Pitman say there is no connection between

24:43.480 --> 24:45.320
drought and climate change.

24:45.320 --> 24:50.960
There is a connection, and unlike your public statements on climate change, it is nuanced.

24:50.960 --> 24:52.900
See here.

24:52.900 --> 24:55.920
Which is exactly what all the other experts are saying.

24:55.920 --> 24:59.780
Experts in the affected regions were caused by a natural weather phenomenon, the Indian

24:59.780 --> 25:03.340
Ocean Dipole, not by man-made climate change.

25:03.340 --> 25:08.060
Sorry, I accidentally injected a clip of another political commentator who's so knowledgeable

25:08.060 --> 25:12.260
about the Indian Ocean Dipole, he thinks it's called a dipole.

25:12.260 --> 25:15.860
It's almost as if he's just heard about it for the first time.

25:15.860 --> 25:20.140
And while this guy may sound like an expert because he addresses his army of loyal followers

25:20.140 --> 25:25.900
with authority and confidence, he's actually one of Australia's most famous political commentators

25:25.900 --> 25:31.040
and another McExpert who doesn't know an Indian Ocean Dipole from a stripper's pole.

25:31.040 --> 25:35.680
There is no reason why climate change should make the landscape more arid.

25:35.680 --> 25:40.920
Well, of course, the experts say there is, you just have to understand it.

25:40.920 --> 25:45.640
And that means firstly understanding the three main natural climate patterns that govern

25:45.640 --> 25:47.620
Australia's rainfall.

25:47.620 --> 25:53.580
To the west, the Indian Ocean Dipole, the Indian Ocean Dipole, the Indian Ocean Dipole

25:53.580 --> 25:57.920
is caused by a temperature differential between the western and eastern parts of the Indian

25:57.920 --> 26:02.020
Ocean, hence the word dipole, shut up.

26:02.020 --> 26:07.400
When it's in a negative phase, warmer water is closer to Australia and we get more rain.

26:07.400 --> 26:11.020
When it's in a positive phase, the opposite happens.

26:11.020 --> 26:17.480
To the east is the El Niño-southern Oscillation, or ENSO, which has a similar temperature differential,

26:17.480 --> 26:20.700
changing rainfall patterns in eastern Australia.

26:20.740 --> 26:25.600
And to the south is the southern annular mode, or the SAM, which pushes rain fronts into

26:25.600 --> 26:31.160
southern Australia in its negative mode but keeps the rain back in its positive mode.

26:31.160 --> 26:35.220
So the worst droughts are caused when more than one of these weather patterns coincides

26:35.220 --> 26:39.880
by giving us the same dry conditions, and that's what's been happening recently with

26:39.880 --> 26:42.440
the AOD and the SAM.

26:42.440 --> 26:46.700
So if it's perfectly natural, why blame climate change?

26:46.700 --> 26:51.480
Because these phenomena are all driven by temperature, especially ocean temperature,

26:51.480 --> 26:56.000
which has been rising, hitting a record high in 2019.

26:56.000 --> 26:57.960
Time to hear again from a real expert.

26:57.960 --> 27:03.000
Australia is known for its extremes, and without climate change we're a land of extremes because

27:03.000 --> 27:07.640
of these variability things that influence us, so we know that at some point they're

27:07.640 --> 27:11.900
going to happen, but put climate change on top of that and it exacerbates those extremes

27:11.900 --> 27:12.900
even further.

27:12.900 --> 27:16.160
And it's not just something that we kind of knew about last year.

27:16.160 --> 27:19.540
What scientists have been talking about is for decades, so we expect to see more extreme

27:19.540 --> 27:20.540
heat.

27:20.540 --> 27:23.620
When we see flooding we expect that to be more extreme, and when we get bushfires we

27:23.620 --> 27:25.820
expect them to be more extreme too.

27:25.820 --> 27:29.220
And especially over eastern Australia, over some parts of Australia there's not really

27:29.220 --> 27:34.620
much of a signal, but over the southeast, longer fire seasons and more intense fires

27:34.620 --> 27:36.540
are conducive with climate change.

27:36.540 --> 27:41.160
So what the experts are saying is that these are natural phenomena, they're what's driven

27:41.160 --> 27:46.140
Australian heatwaves, droughts and bushfires in the past, but in the last few decades

27:46.140 --> 27:50.480
they've been happening on a rising platform of global temperature, which means that every

27:50.480 --> 27:57.240
weather event is more accentuated from droughts and heatwaves to rainfall and floods.

27:57.240 --> 28:01.160
Studies have shown the influence of global warming on these natural phenomena.

28:01.160 --> 28:06.280
Back in 2009 this study laid the blame for recent droughts on a positive Indian Ocean

28:06.280 --> 28:10.520
Dipole exacerbated by rising temperatures.

28:10.520 --> 28:16.260
In the same year this paper concluded that the Indian Ocean Dipole Index has been increasing

28:16.260 --> 28:21.600
along with regional temperatures and concluded that climate change will increase the occurrence

28:21.600 --> 28:24.060
of positive IOD events.

28:24.060 --> 28:26.620
Those are the ones that cause drought.

28:26.620 --> 28:31.300
So if scientists are pointing the finger at climate change not as a cause but as an amplifier

28:31.300 --> 28:36.780
of natural causes, making heatwaves, droughts and bushfires worse, what excuses are left

28:36.780 --> 28:38.660
to ignore it?

28:38.680 --> 28:44.240
Well it's the old thoughts and prayers excuse, now is not the time to talk about it.

28:44.240 --> 28:47.880
My only thoughts today are with those who have lost their lives.

28:47.880 --> 28:51.120
I certainly don't think it's appropriate to get into a political argument.

28:51.120 --> 28:54.400
I'll tell you this, I'm not going to cop it and if that's the rest of this interview

28:54.400 --> 28:56.120
we'll give lost news for the morning.

28:56.120 --> 29:01.560
The bushfire and climate change debate, it's dumb, it's reckless, it's offensive.

29:01.560 --> 29:05.560
Now is not the time to be talking about climate change.

29:05.560 --> 29:08.640
So here's the problem the Australian Government faces.

29:08.640 --> 29:13.700
It has to run a tightrope between appeasing voters who are mostly calling for action and

29:13.700 --> 29:18.380
powerful members of its parliamentary party who either want to downplay the role of climate

29:18.380 --> 29:22.140
change or don't even accept the basic science.

29:22.140 --> 29:26.100
And this is the Deputy Prime Minister about to answer the question, do you agree that

29:26.100 --> 29:29.300
there needs to be further action on climate change?

29:29.300 --> 29:34.180
Now the answer is either yes or no, and saying no to taking action is never a good political

29:34.180 --> 29:39.800
move, but if he says yes, he knows the follow-up question is going to be, OK, what sort of

29:39.800 --> 29:42.640
further action will you take?

29:42.640 --> 29:47.120
When a politician knows an uncomfortable follow-up question is coming, he'll stall it at all

29:47.120 --> 29:51.640
costs by droning on at length about other topics without pausing for a breath so the

29:51.640 --> 29:54.560
reporters have no chance of interrupting to ask the question again.

29:54.560 --> 29:56.760
Let's watch the masterclass in how that's done.

29:56.760 --> 30:01.000
There's been a lot of hysteria around climate change.

30:01.000 --> 30:03.860
Climate change isn't the only factor that has caused these fires.

30:03.860 --> 30:09.140
There's been dry lightning strikes, there's been self-combusting piles of manure, there's

30:09.140 --> 30:10.860
been a lot of arsonists out there.

30:10.860 --> 30:13.100
Ah, throw in the arsonist excuse.

30:13.100 --> 30:14.100
Good.

30:14.100 --> 30:15.300
You can use up to a minute on that.

30:15.300 --> 30:20.320
Somebody who is deliberately lighting a fire to cause mischief indeed, potentially property

30:20.320 --> 30:25.620
damage and even death, should be dobbed in to Crimestoppers on 1800 333 000.

30:25.620 --> 30:28.020
And if somebody sees a fire...

30:28.040 --> 30:32.660
The reason a politician rambles on like this is not because he's forgotten the question.

30:32.660 --> 30:37.560
He's hoping the reporter will forget the question and instead follow something else the politician

30:37.560 --> 30:39.840
mentions in his diatribe.

30:39.840 --> 30:42.520
Or he's hoping to simply run down the clock.

30:42.520 --> 30:47.400
The journalist would have been told by a ministerial aide that this is only a ten minute doorstop

30:47.400 --> 30:51.240
and on the ten minute mark the aide will step in and tell the minister he's expected at

30:51.240 --> 30:52.720
his next appointment.

30:52.720 --> 30:56.640
So all the politician has to do is keep talking.

30:56.640 --> 30:57.640
How's he getting on?

30:57.640 --> 31:00.900
A person in authority that they actually heed those warnings.

31:00.900 --> 31:01.900
Fire...

31:01.900 --> 31:05.900
But I'll put you out of your misery.

31:05.900 --> 31:10.580
When he eventually stopped talking the reporter asked exactly the same question again and

31:10.580 --> 31:14.820
the Deputy Prime Minister was forced to admit that more needed to be done.

31:14.820 --> 31:18.940
But of course the government's argument is there's no point because there's nothing we

31:18.940 --> 31:21.060
can do about it anyway.

31:21.060 --> 31:27.220
Australia is responsible for just 1.3% of global emissions.

31:27.220 --> 31:34.240
The real problem it seems was that the Morrison government hadn't magically turned down the

31:34.240 --> 31:38.220
world's temperature by cutting Australia's tiny emissions.

31:38.220 --> 31:43.780
And even if the entire planet turned carbon neutral tomorrow we would still have summers

31:43.780 --> 31:47.440
like this, we would still have fires like this.

31:47.440 --> 31:49.620
For once the experts agree.

31:49.620 --> 31:55.120
Taking action on CO2 emissions now won't stop the mega fires we're dealing with now.

31:55.120 --> 32:00.440
The time to have taken action to avoid today's mega fires was in the 1980s when the world's

32:00.440 --> 32:03.960
politicians first recognised the problem.

32:03.960 --> 32:07.820
But they decided to kick the can down the road because they knew that the effects of

32:07.820 --> 32:13.420
any CO2 reduction policies they took then would be decades away and they were more concerned

32:13.420 --> 32:15.980
about the next general election.

32:15.980 --> 32:19.060
And government politicians are doing the same thing today.

32:19.060 --> 32:24.920
The effects of any policies they introduce now won't be felt for another 30 years.

32:24.920 --> 32:28.340
And their political careers will be over by then.

32:28.340 --> 32:33.660
When the fires abate at the end of this season and this drought finally ends, as it inevitably

32:33.660 --> 32:37.220
will, they can proclaim that the crisis is over.

32:37.220 --> 32:42.200
As droughts, heatwaves and mega fires continue to become more frequent and more intense they'll

32:42.200 --> 32:45.520
just hope it'll be someone else's problem.

32:45.520 --> 32:52.260
As for the argument that Australia only contributes 1.3% of anthropogenic CO2, that's also true.

32:52.260 --> 32:56.700
Even if Australia stopped emitting CO2 altogether it would make very little difference to the

32:56.700 --> 32:59.240
global warming trend.

32:59.240 --> 33:06.440
But France is only responsible for 0.9% of the world's CO2 emissions, Germany 2.1%, Japan

33:06.440 --> 33:08.680
3.6%.

33:08.680 --> 33:13.160
If every country took a view that it doesn't have to do anything because its own CO2 emissions

33:13.160 --> 33:16.880
are just a fraction of the total, nothing would ever get done.

33:16.880 --> 33:19.720
We'd just expect China to do it alone.

33:19.720 --> 33:25.080
And China could then use the argument that its emissions per capita are only 7.7 tonnes

33:25.080 --> 33:28.480
a year, less than half those of Australia.

33:28.480 --> 33:33.980
So solving an international problem requires international cooperation.

33:33.980 --> 33:39.020
Australia has diplomatic clout in the world and shunning summit meetings on climate change

33:39.020 --> 33:44.760
and thwarting international climate agreements by demanding privileged loopholes is not making

33:44.760 --> 33:49.160
Australia popular and it isn't even in our own self-interest.

33:49.160 --> 33:53.600
This country stands to benefit more than most from the energy revolution.

33:53.600 --> 33:58.640
When an international agreement is made, South Korea and Japan want to build economies based

33:58.640 --> 34:05.200
on hydrogen fuel made in Australia because we have a wealth of clean, renewable energy.

34:05.200 --> 34:09.880
It's not going to cost us anything, but what is costing us is the result of government

34:09.880 --> 34:12.660
inaction 40 years ago.

34:12.660 --> 34:18.400
And there's nothing that Australia can or ever will do that will change the global climate.

34:18.400 --> 34:21.180
But of course, again, scientists disagree.

34:21.180 --> 34:28.920
Researchers since 1896 – 1896! – have shown conclusively that increasing CO2 concentration

34:28.920 --> 34:31.180
raises global temperature.

34:31.180 --> 34:36.540
To all those who doubt that, don't just read magazine stories, read the science.

34:36.540 --> 34:40.560
And scientific studies have been warning for decades that this is going to increase climatic

34:40.560 --> 34:44.400
extremes in Australia, including bushfires.

34:44.400 --> 34:48.840
So what scientists have been urging for the last four decades is that to mitigate these

34:48.840 --> 34:53.800
droughts, heatwaves and megafires, you need to reduce the concentration of the gas that's

34:53.800 --> 34:56.700
making them more and more extreme.

34:56.700 --> 35:00.000
So finally, what do I think is the cause of these bushfires?

35:00.000 --> 35:02.100
Well, I'll tell you.

35:02.100 --> 35:03.840
It doesn't matter.

35:03.840 --> 35:09.160
Neither my amateur opinion nor the opinions of amateurs in videos, blogs, TV commentaries,

35:09.160 --> 35:13.920
pubs, clubs and knitting circles matter when it comes to science.

35:13.920 --> 35:18.580
Especially when all most amateurs are doing is simply quoting from each other and passing

35:18.580 --> 35:22.420
round nonsense beliefs that's at variance with the facts.

35:22.420 --> 35:26.400
So I'm going to leave the last word with one of those researchers.

35:26.400 --> 35:32.120
I don't want to say, I told you so, no climate scientist does, but that kind of sits there.

35:32.120 --> 35:34.740
You're like, well, this is not a surprise to us.

35:34.740 --> 35:38.880
It's still utterly devastating and it breaks my heart to see my country on fire.

35:38.880 --> 35:39.880
It really does.

35:39.880 --> 35:42.720
It was just a matter of time when this perfect storm happened.

35:42.720 --> 35:47.120
And the thing is, as we move further into the future and the climate warms even more,

35:47.120 --> 35:48.320
what's going to happen then?

35:48.320 --> 35:50.840
Sure, climate variability will have a role.

35:50.840 --> 35:51.840
It always has a role.

35:51.840 --> 35:57.760
But if it's two or three degrees hotter, not just one degree hotter, how bad can it really

35:57.760 --> 35:58.760
get?

35:58.760 --> 36:00.560
And I guess that's what concerns me the most.

36:00.560 --> 36:02.800
Not how bad it is now, but how bad it will be in the future.
