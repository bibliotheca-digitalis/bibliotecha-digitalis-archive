0	5900	Make no mistake, the tragedy unfolding in Australia is climate change based.
5900	10380	Well perhaps that's a conclusion best left to the experts, rather than an acceptance
10380	12580	speech at the Golden Globes.
12580	17620	So let's hear the scientific conclusion from Australia's leading climate scientist.
17620	20300	Climate change isn't the cause of these bushfires.
20300	25520	Wait, my mistake, this isn't Australia's leading climate scientist, it's plain old TV commentator
25520	28900	Peter Credlin, also not an expert.
29160	33640	Aren't there any real researchers out there who can give us an expert conclusion?
33640	37880	We seem to be inundated with pundits all over the world who've suddenly found Australia
37880	44540	on a map and decided that after five minutes surfing the internet they know what's causing
44540	50320	the bushfires and of course they think we're in dire need of their McExpert opinion.
50320	54640	So let me start by saying that I'm no more of an expert than they are, so I'm not going
54640	58640	to set myself up as one or make up my own theories.
58640	61960	As always, I'm going to report the science.
61960	67840	The real experts will tell you that the link between climate change and bushfires is complicated.
67840	71460	But let's look at this through the eyes of the amateurs and take a closer look at what
71460	77260	the science says in response, starting with the excuse that we're not seeing anything new.
77260	84420	Nothing to see here, please, experts, nothing to see here, please.
84420	90740	See that this nation, this state, has seen similar conditions and similar disasters many,
90740	92360	many times over.
92360	96540	The fact none of these bushfires were in any way extraordinary compared to not just the
96540	102500	last 50 years but indeed the last 150 years was an inconvenient truth.
102500	106800	Yes, apparently it's the normal climate of Australia.
106800	110260	Not exactly a new phenomenon in Australia.
110260	115140	And of course that's true, Australia has always had bushfires, droughts and heatwaves.
115140	119900	I think you'd be hard-pressed to find a single scientific study that disagrees.
119900	124460	But what climate researchers want to know, and I would have thought this was pretty obvious,
124460	129020	is whether temperatures have been rising and whether the heatwaves, droughts and fires
129020	131020	have been getting worse.
131020	135900	One way to find out if it was hotter in the past is to go back over old newspaper clippings
135900	140540	and see if you can find heatwaves or very hot days on different dates in different parts
140540	141540	of the country.
141540	145460	Now let's look at an Australian heatwave which occurred 80 years ago.
145460	149500	They're easy to find, but of course they don't tell us much.
149500	155100	Australia is a huge continent, so cherry-picking a record temperature in one particular town
155100	159600	doesn't tell you what's happening in the rest of the country or the rest of that year, let
159600	162140	alone over several decades.
162140	164960	That's why experts don't do it that way.
164960	170680	They take national annual averages and build up a complete picture.
170680	175620	And by including all the data, this is the complete picture, and right away you can see
175620	178200	the obvious warming trend.
178200	183520	This reconstruction from Berkeley Earth shows a 12-month moving average in grey and a 10-year
183520	188780	moving average in red, and this one, which is a straight plot of average annual temperatures
188780	192520	over time, comes from the Bureau of Meteorology.
192520	200120	And that's how the BOM determined that December 17th 2019 was the hottest day on record thus far.
200120	204620	So when BOM says it was the hottest day on record, what exactly does that mean?
204620	208400	Does that mean going back 20 years, 30 years, 50 years?
208400	212480	Well it means that the average temperature across the whole country, taking data from
212480	218440	all the weather stations, shows that up to that time, December 17th 2019 was the hottest
218440	220080	on record.
220080	226620	And since the Bureau of Meteorology's records began in 1910, that means since 1910, unless
226620	228720	the BOM specifies otherwise.
228720	232720	The Bureau of Meteorology's claiming that Australia's hottest day on record came on
232720	237620	a day when BOREC was 24 degrees below their all-time record maximum.
237620	239520	That doesn't sound very credible to me.
239520	244340	Yeah, but that's why this data analysis is best left to qualified professionals.
244340	249100	A record high average doesn't mean that every single weather station has to hit a record
249140	251620	high temperature on that day.
251620	257100	It means that the average of all the weather stations is at a record high.
257100	260580	Most will be below their individual all-time highs.
260580	265620	That's especially true of BOREC, which unofficially recorded Australia's hottest ever temperature
265620	269840	of 51.7 degrees centigrade in 1909.
269840	274540	The reading is thought to be a mistake, but even if it's accurate, BOREC is very unlikely
274540	280340	to match that record just because Australia's national average hits a record high.
280340	282500	Climate doesn't work that way.
282500	287140	It's a big continent, and on that particular day the south-east of Australia, including
287140	291900	BOREC, was influenced by a weather front in the Tasman Sea, and temperatures were mostly
291900	294080	below average.
294080	296540	Temperatures haven't been significantly higher either.
296540	303220	In fact, during the years 1899 to 1901, average December mean maximum temperatures were well
303260	305740	above 38 degrees.
305740	309000	But why not read the caption on your own graph?
309000	311780	This isn't the mean temperature for Australia.
311780	314220	It's the data from just one weather station.
314220	318280	Don't they teach the concept of averages in schools any more?
318280	323700	You have to look at the average annual temperature data, not just cherry-pick one place in one
323700	326960	month that gives you the result you want.
326960	331260	The only way you can dismiss this pretty clear temperature rise is to believe that there's
331260	336460	a conspiracy to cook up fraudulent figures and somehow hide the real ones.
336460	341020	Note that the weather girl is cleverly standing in front of eastern Australia, and it wasn't
341020	343860	particularly hot over there on December 17th.
343860	348740	So that's how they hide below average temperatures, by sticking a weather girl in front of them.
348740	351700	What a cunning plan, simple yet brilliant.
351700	355960	I guess from now on I'll check the weather the way most Aussies do, from the numerous
355960	360980	TV forecasts we get every day where weather presenters can't get in the way, well unless
360980	363940	you live in Mexico where it's unavoidable.
363940	366020	Time for hide the data plan B.
366020	369820	But if we look at the Bureau of Meteorology's temperature graph for Australia, you can see
369820	372100	they begin in 1910.
372100	375800	They hide all of the extremely hot weather which occurred prior to then.
375800	380100	What certainly sounds devious, but instead of jumping straight to the conclusion that
380100	384040	there's a conspiracy, why not simply find out the reason?
384040	387860	It only requires a little bit of effort because the answer's right there on the Bureau of
387860	389840	Meteorology website.
389840	396740	The BOM didn't have any data before 1910 because it only started operations in 1908.
396740	400720	And while your next question will probably be, why didn't they show other data that
400720	405880	had been collected before they were founded, the answer to that is also pretty easy.
405880	406900	They do.
406900	412080	The data for all the stations prior to 1910 is freely available on the Bureau of Meteorology
412080	413080	website.
413080	417920	In fact, we've already seen one, and there's also an historical reconstruction based on
417920	423080	that data, also on the BOM website compiled by Berkeley Earth.
423080	429080	The problem, as you can see, is that the readings have huge margins of error prior to 1910 because
429080	431840	there was no standardisation.
431840	436200	Weather stations were using different instruments, taking readings at different times of day
436200	438400	and under different conditions.
438400	443740	So as soon as it was founded, the BOM standardised meteorological instruments and data gathering
443740	446960	techniques all across Australia.
446960	451760	So while the Bureau of Meteorology is happy to put all this pre-1910 data on its website
451760	457000	for you to download, as well as reconstructions that use it, it does so with a warning that
457000	459360	the data is not reliable.
459360	464800	That's why it starts its own official records from the year of standardisation, 1910.
464800	468880	Actually, let's just get back to that page from their website.
468880	473680	If you look at the value on the right hand side, just after the year 2000, notice how
473680	474680	that…what?
474680	477520	They're hiding the figures!
477520	478520	Not again!
478520	482120	Damn your cunning tricks, Bureau of Meteorology!
482120	485440	So obviously I can't show you that, but let's go on and look at the drought.
485440	490120	It's a hard one to define because there are so many different ways of measuring it.
490120	495240	But if we take rainfall alone, there's no evidence that Australia is getting less rain
495240	497040	and no reason why it should.
497040	500800	What's happening is that rainfall patterns are changing.
500800	505960	If we start looking at patterns from 1950, about the time temperatures began rising,
505960	510760	eastern and southwestern parts of Australia, which are the big population and agricultural
510760	516760	centres seem to be getting drier, while the north and northwest are getting wetter.
516760	520560	And that's being confirmed by scientific studies, which we'll look at more closely
520560	522600	later in the video.
522600	526880	So that brings us on to the most relevant trend, the fires themselves.
526880	531400	Is the 2019-2020 fire season perfectly normal?
531400	537520	Australia's acting and retired fire chiefs, each with a lifetime experience fighting bushfires,
537520	541800	came together to warn the government, no, this is not normal.
541800	547320	Never before have we had 17 concurrent emergency warning fires burning at once.
547320	549160	So there's something going on.
549160	551720	And that's supported by scientific studies.
551720	557320	The best way to quantify this is to look at the FFDI, the Forest Fire Danger Index,
557320	562520	which measures the likelihood of fires breaking out based on rainfall, evaporation, humidity,
562520	564880	temperature and other factors.
564880	569600	At least two studies have shown that the FFDI has been trending upwards.
569600	574400	This 2007 study is interesting because it not only found that the FFDI rose for the
574400	579920	previous three decades, but it predicted that fire weather conditions would worsen, increasing
579920	584760	the FFDI between 4 and 25 per cent by 2020.
584760	586360	That's now.
586360	590960	And this study found that the FFDI increased significantly in nearly half the stations
590960	597280	it checked between 1973 and 2010, a clear upward trend.
597280	600960	All of which means, yes, there is something to see here.
600960	606800	So the next excuse is, but it's not climate change, it's arsonists.
606800	609920	What was the heart, the arson element of this story?
609920	610920	That was my question.
610920	611920	Oh, my God.
611920	614980	Now we've got five bloody armchair experts.
614980	616160	It's hard to tell what's true or not.
616160	621080	I see pictures of people who allegedly set the fires and they're running away and there's
621080	626160	50 people in jail on charges of arson or something in Australia.
626160	628160	But, you know, they've been charged.
628160	630040	But have they been found guilty yet?
630040	631040	I don't know.
631040	634680	Aren't some of the arsonists climate nutters, though, as well?
634680	637960	Guess what the primary cause of these fires was?
637960	640520	People deliberately starting the fires.
640520	643320	Now that may be true, but it isn't.
643320	645520	You can't just make stuff up out of thin air.
645520	647760	You have to check the figures.
647760	654360	According to the Australian Institute of Criminology, from September 2019 to December 2019, which
654360	659640	was when you decided we needed the benefit of your McExpert opinion, only around 13 per
659640	662340	cent of fires were started by arson.
662340	664900	That's hardly the primary cause.
664900	670340	It's possible many of the 36 per cent of fires deemed suspicious may turn out to be arson.
670340	671340	We don't know.
671340	675860	And there's loads of articles talking about how now the fires are being blamed on arsonists.
675860	679300	I'm sure there are, but that doesn't mean it's true.
679300	683880	James Delingpole, a columnist for Breitbart News who never studied science past playing
683880	689000	with Newton's balls at prep school, thinks there are 180 arsonists.
689000	693720	This guy thinks there are 183 arsonists, and he even knows the political philosophy
693720	695120	of everyone.
695120	697840	Apparently they're all leftists.
697840	703880	This figure, either 183, more than 180 or nearly 200, has been going round the blogosphere
703880	709480	so many times that Donald Trump Jr picked up on it and tweeted it to thousands of his
709480	710480	followers.
710480	713160	In Australia, it's known as a furphy.
713160	718720	Or to put it in words that the McExperts understand, it's all total bullshit.
718720	720760	So where does this figure come from?
720760	726160	Well, it started with a completely false headline in the Australian newspaper.
726160	731380	Firebugs fuelling crisis as national arson arrest toll hits 183.
731380	737600	The Australian is published by Rupert Murdoch, so accuracy is not exactly a priority.
737600	744080	The Australian cites its source as a NSW police report, so let's go to the source and, yes,
744080	749200	your way ahead of me, discover how the headline writers got it wrong.
749200	755480	Turns out these weren't 183 cases of arson, they were 183 cases of fire-related incidents
755480	757320	in NSW.
757320	762560	Only 24 people were charged with arson, 57 had legal action, which could be as simple
762560	768260	as a caution, for failing to comply with the total fire ban, for example by lighting campfires
768260	774160	or barbecues or even operating machinery in areas where a fire ban is in place.
774160	779980	And 47 were cautioned or charged with discarding matches or lit cigarettes on the ground.
779980	787140	So 24 alleged arsonists gets bumped up to 183 and then rounded up to nearly 200.
787140	791780	You have to read past the fake headlines to see the actual figures buried in the body
791780	797240	of these stories, which of course most armchair experts can't be bothered to do.
797240	803200	But OK, even 24 of these huge fires is nothing to scoff at, and there are many more suspected
803200	807460	arson attacks where the perpetrators haven't been caught.
807460	812720	But it turns out that arsonists aren't responsible for most of these big fires.
812720	818120	According to the experts, remember them, the most common cause is not arson or discarded
818120	823880	cigarettes or any form of human activity, the most common cause by far is lightning
823880	825520	strikes.
825840	829440	Inspector Ben Sheppard of the NSW Rural Fire Service said,
829440	833640	I can confidently say the majority of larger fires we've been dealing with have been
833640	839400	the result of fires coming out of remote areas as a result of dry lightning storms.
839400	843680	According to Brett Mitchell, CFA Incident Controller in Bairnsdale, East Gippsland,
843680	849080	where some of the worst fires occurred, most of the fires have been caused by lightning.
849080	854040	And Victoria's Fire Chief says dry lightning, not arson, is the main cause of the state's
854040	856280	destructive bushfires.
856280	861860	But how can that be, you ask, if the statistics I've just quoted show that natural causes
861860	868200	like lightning strikes are only responsible for starting about 6% of the fires?
868200	870820	Well because not all fires are equal.
870820	875240	One fire might be huge, another might be tiny.
875240	880240	Most fires started accidentally or deliberately by humans are quickly spotted and in places
880240	883600	that are easily accessible to fire trucks.
883600	888280	Fires from lightning strikes tend to start in remote areas of thick forest and bushland
888280	892520	where there's lots of fuel and they're hard to reach, and hard to control.
892520	897280	They're the ones burning up millions of acres of forest and becoming unstoppable as
897280	899080	they advance on small towns.
899080	903520	That's why the Fire Chiefs are saying, it's lightning that's responsible for these
903520	905720	large fires.
905720	910840	Most arson offences relate to small grass fires and things like rubbish bins set alight.
910840	917900	In Victoria, only about 0.03% of the millions of acres burned was due to arson.
917900	922440	And none of South Australia's deadliest or most destructive fires are being treated
922440	924440	as suspicious.
924440	929320	That doesn't mean to say arson isn't a serious problem, arsonists are a bloody menace
929320	934000	and sometimes they are responsible for destroying homes and even killing people.
934000	936560	But unfortunately they're nothing new.
936560	940740	What's different between this season and last season is not the sudden appearance of
940740	946120	an army of arsonists, but a long period of drought, record high air temperature and a
946120	951180	higher forest fire danger index, which are all part of a growing trend.
951180	956180	So when lightning strikes, these hot dry forests erupt in flame.
956180	961080	So the objective of this disinformation campaign seems to be to take attention away from these
961080	966540	worsening fire conditions and blame Australians themselves for starting these fires, which
966540	970180	is not only misleading, but insulting.
970180	973820	And if that doesn't work, we'll find someone else to blame.
973820	977140	OK, so who knows about this?
977140	978760	Oh, I have something.
978760	981780	I think you can guess this isn't going to turn out well.
981780	988740	I was reading a paper the other day and one of the stories was about how actually the
988740	993540	reason that the fires are getting so bad is they stopped doing controlled burns.
993540	998980	Yeah, yeah, that's a classic example of land management issue, isn't it?
998980	1002040	They're not clearing the end of growth, they're not doing controlled burns.
1002040	1007120	Because green environmentalist policies have outlawed property owners doing controlled
1007120	1012060	burns that create firebreaks to prevent inferno spreading.
1012060	1016680	What's happening is radical left-wing environmentalists in Australia are stopping the country from
1016680	1021420	conducting the controlled burns it needs to keep these wildfires from happening.
1021420	1026100	Turns out he's referencing a Breitbart News op-ed by our old friend James Delingpole,
1026100	1027900	the political commentator.
1027900	1030980	And it got passed around the internet by everybody else.
1030980	1035740	So let's inject a few facts into this maelstrom of ignogeneous ignorance.
1035740	1041520	Firstly, the Green Party, which is pretty representative of the Greenies in Australia,
1041520	1043120	supports prescribed burns.
1043120	1044980	It says so in its manifesto.
1044980	1049780	Secondly, the fire chiefs, and in case you've forgotten, they are the experts, not the POMI
1049780	1053280	politicos, say this is not a problem they face.
1053280	1058880	The single biggest impediment to completing hazard reduction burning is the weather.
1058880	1064820	And with longer fire seasons, earlier starts and later finishes to fire seasons, like we've
1064820	1070440	been experiencing over recent times, you get a shrinking window of opportunity for more
1070440	1072840	favourable hazard reduction burning periods.
1072840	1079320	And in that shrinking window you get the extremes of it can be too wet and too cold to effectively
1079320	1085200	get hazard reduction burns done through to it being too hot and too dry and therefore
1085200	1086200	too dangerous.
1086200	1091120	Look, it's very clear, and any fire service will tell you, that the windows for hazard
1091120	1094680	reduction through the winter are getting narrower and narrower.
1094680	1099500	Now, a slight lift in temperature overall, average temperature, means the extremes are
1099500	1102020	more extreme.
1102020	1104640	We can't light a burn and just let it run.
1104640	1107240	Lighting a hazard reduction burn is complicated.
1107240	1108520	It's resource hungry.
1108520	1109700	It's risky.
1109700	1114360	And the minute we see a burn lit, I end up getting inundated with claims for people wanting
1114360	1117600	us to pay for their shade cloth on their greenhouse.
1117600	1121760	The suntough on their back pergola has now got embers that have landed on it.
1121760	1126720	So there's so many ramifications that come from prescribed burning.
1126720	1132580	Hazard reduction has a place and is a valuable tool for day-to-day fires, for normal seasons.
1132580	1136400	But when you've got a really tough season, when you've got awful fire weather conditions,
1136400	1141200	so when you're running fires under severe extreme or worse conditions, hazard reduction
1141200	1144760	has very little effect at all on fire spread.
1144760	1150640	It's only when the conditions back off a little bit, generally speaking overnight, or when
1150640	1155020	the severe extreme or catastrophic conditions get right back to, say, very high, that you've
1155020	1158080	actually got some prospect of slowing the fire spread.
1158080	1162600	So it's important, but not the panacea, and something that we should have a very open
1162600	1164600	and frank discussion about.
1164600	1168440	The other point here is about all the emotion around these fuel reduction burns.
1168440	1174160	The reality is, I am concerned, and it's interesting now, my peer in New South Wales has come out
1174160	1178920	quite strongly, Shane Fitzsimmons, and said exactly the same thing, which is essentially,
1178920	1182600	we can't see these fuel reduction burns as a silver bullet.
1182600	1187980	Yes, we need to do fuel reduction burns, but they're not going to solve all our problems.
1187980	1192560	So an example in Gippsland, where we had a fuel reduction burn go through in 2014, didn't
1192560	1194340	slow this fire up at all.
1194340	1199380	And I can say, in any given year, of all the burns that we've got ready to go, 70 or 80
1199380	1201540	per cent are cleared, environmentally ready to go.
1201540	1204100	We're just waiting for the window of opportunity.
1204100	1209380	We've gone from completing, lucky to be 40 or 50 per cent of our annual burn programs,
1209380	1212000	to now up to 80 or 90 per cent of our burn programs.
1212000	1215620	And according to the New South Wales Department of Planning, Industry and Environment, the
1215620	1221140	main reason for the increase is not the successful quashing of greeny protests, but increased
1221140	1224260	funding for the crews that do this hazard reduction work.
1224260	1226100	Sorry, carry on, Shane.
1226100	1230020	If there's a risk in an area and it needs treating with hazard reduction work, we can
1230020	1234460	serve notices on private and public landholders to get that work done.
1234460	1239580	Yes, burning is important, but some of the hysteria that this will be the problem that
1239580	1244300	solves or the solution to all our problems is really just quite an emotional load of
1244300	1245860	rubbish to be honest.
1245860	1247660	The figures back all that up.
1247660	1252120	In its most recent annual report, the New South Wales Rural Fire Service said it had
1252120	1259300	planned 19,896 prescribed burns and carried out 16,556 of them.
1259300	1261340	That's 83 per cent.
1261340	1265680	I'm sure people will post anecdotal tales on the forum of how they weren't allowed to
1265680	1270820	remove trees or burn bush on their own properties, but every council is different.
1270820	1273120	Every neighbourhood is different.
1273120	1275380	This is the view from my backyard.
1275380	1280440	We've had to evacuate twice as forest fires got close, so I'd love to do a prescribed
1280440	1285140	burn every couple of years in our wooded area that backs onto a national forest, or have
1285140	1287620	the fire service come in and do it.
1287620	1292360	But even if conditions were right during the short time period available between ever lengthening
1292360	1297060	fire seasons, the biggest objections would come from my neighbours.
1297060	1300840	Not because they're greenies, but because they're worried that a prescribed burn might
1300840	1304980	get out of control and destroy their half million dollar houses.
1304980	1306960	That does happen.
1306960	1312720	Regardless of individual cases, what these trained and experienced fire chiefs are explaining
1312720	1317940	is the overall picture of the difficulties they face in carrying out prescribed burns,
1317940	1323520	the success they've had despite these difficulties, the increased rates of hazard reduction, the
1323520	1328200	fact that these prescribed burns aren't a panacea anyway, and their frustration at the
1328200	1332560	way armchair critics are getting emotional over the issue rather than looking at the
1332560	1334320	facts.
1334320	1338740	And when the blame game runs out, it's finally time to face the question of whether climate
1338740	1341900	change might be contributing to this.
1341900	1345660	If you're into science and facts, you have to accept that the nation's most pre-eminent
1345660	1350280	experts say there's no direct link between this drought and climate change.
1350280	1352180	There's no long-term drying trend.
1352180	1354540	Now the first part of that is true.
1354540	1358900	Most experts say you can't attribute a single drought or a single weather event to climate
1358900	1360300	change.
1360300	1364840	For example, let's hear from Sarah Perkins Kirkpatrick, a senior researcher on climate
1364840	1366880	at the University of New South Wales.
1366880	1371020	So the last few winters we've had really low rainfall, and that's obviously what's ignited
1371020	1374960	the drought and it's, you know, perpetuated for that amount of time, but we can't really
1374960	1378680	find a signal due to natural variability in there, nor climate change.
1378680	1381260	It's not to say neither of one of those is driving it.
1381260	1385160	It's just not as obvious as what we would expect it to be.
1385160	1387280	But the second part of Sky News's claim…
1387280	1391780	The nation's most pre-eminent experts say there's no long-term drying trend.
1391780	1393680	… is incorrect.
1393680	1397780	Here are some of the nation's most pre-eminent climate experts, and that's exactly what
1397780	1399100	they say.
1399100	1403780	They condense their published research into a report in plain language that even arts
1403780	1407080	graduates and political commentators can understand.
1407080	1412580	Climate change is likely making drought conditions in south-west and south-east Australia worse.
1412580	1416540	In Australia it's clear that climate change has reduced rainfall in the south-east and
1416540	1418920	south-west corners of the continent.
1418920	1423440	Precipitation patterns have changed markedly over the past two decades, with a pronounced
1423440	1426920	drying trend in these two important agricultural regions.
1426920	1429880	So which experts is he getting his information from?
1429880	1436400	Well I listen to scientists and my key source is Professor Andy Pitman, who's a world-renowned
1436400	1437920	expert in this area.
1437920	1443160	Well maybe you're either not listening to Dr Pitman, or you don't understand his research.
1443160	1448060	In plain language Dr Pitman says higher temperatures don't lead directly to higher evaporation
1448060	1452860	and a higher risk of drought, but he says they do lead to changes in rainfall patterns
1452860	1454920	which can lead to drought.
1454920	1459860	In some regions, says Dr Pitman, global warming increases the risk of drought, and in other
1459860	1464740	regions it decreases the risk, as we've already seen.
1464740	1469300	Even the Australian Research Council's Centre of Excellence for Climate Extremes, where
1469300	1476200	Dr Pitman is director, had to issue a media release telling these TV and newspaper McExperts
1476200	1479120	to stop misrepresenting him.
1479120	1483480	Stop claiming our scientists and director Andy Pitman say there is no connection between
1483480	1485320	drought and climate change.
1485320	1490960	There is a connection, and unlike your public statements on climate change, it is nuanced.
1490960	1492900	See here.
1492900	1495920	Which is exactly what all the other experts are saying.
1495920	1499780	Experts in the affected regions were caused by a natural weather phenomenon, the Indian
1499780	1503340	Ocean Dipole, not by man-made climate change.
1503340	1508060	Sorry, I accidentally injected a clip of another political commentator who's so knowledgeable
1508060	1512260	about the Indian Ocean Dipole, he thinks it's called a dipole.
1512260	1515860	It's almost as if he's just heard about it for the first time.
1515860	1520140	And while this guy may sound like an expert because he addresses his army of loyal followers
1520140	1525900	with authority and confidence, he's actually one of Australia's most famous political commentators
1525900	1531040	and another McExpert who doesn't know an Indian Ocean Dipole from a stripper's pole.
1531040	1535680	There is no reason why climate change should make the landscape more arid.
1535680	1540920	Well, of course, the experts say there is, you just have to understand it.
1540920	1545640	And that means firstly understanding the three main natural climate patterns that govern
1545640	1547620	Australia's rainfall.
1547620	1553580	To the west, the Indian Ocean Dipole, the Indian Ocean Dipole, the Indian Ocean Dipole
1553580	1557920	is caused by a temperature differential between the western and eastern parts of the Indian
1557920	1562020	Ocean, hence the word dipole, shut up.
1562020	1567400	When it's in a negative phase, warmer water is closer to Australia and we get more rain.
1567400	1571020	When it's in a positive phase, the opposite happens.
1571020	1577480	To the east is the El Niño-southern Oscillation, or ENSO, which has a similar temperature differential,
1577480	1580700	changing rainfall patterns in eastern Australia.
1580740	1585600	And to the south is the southern annular mode, or the SAM, which pushes rain fronts into
1585600	1591160	southern Australia in its negative mode but keeps the rain back in its positive mode.
1591160	1595220	So the worst droughts are caused when more than one of these weather patterns coincides
1595220	1599880	by giving us the same dry conditions, and that's what's been happening recently with
1599880	1602440	the AOD and the SAM.
1602440	1606700	So if it's perfectly natural, why blame climate change?
1606700	1611480	Because these phenomena are all driven by temperature, especially ocean temperature,
1611480	1616000	which has been rising, hitting a record high in 2019.
1616000	1617960	Time to hear again from a real expert.
1617960	1623000	Australia is known for its extremes, and without climate change we're a land of extremes because
1623000	1627640	of these variability things that influence us, so we know that at some point they're
1627640	1631900	going to happen, but put climate change on top of that and it exacerbates those extremes
1631900	1632900	even further.
1632900	1636160	And it's not just something that we kind of knew about last year.
1636160	1639540	What scientists have been talking about is for decades, so we expect to see more extreme
1639540	1640540	heat.
1640540	1643620	When we see flooding we expect that to be more extreme, and when we get bushfires we
1643620	1645820	expect them to be more extreme too.
1645820	1649220	And especially over eastern Australia, over some parts of Australia there's not really
1649220	1654620	much of a signal, but over the southeast, longer fire seasons and more intense fires
1654620	1656540	are conducive with climate change.
1656540	1661160	So what the experts are saying is that these are natural phenomena, they're what's driven
1661160	1666140	Australian heatwaves, droughts and bushfires in the past, but in the last few decades
1666140	1670480	they've been happening on a rising platform of global temperature, which means that every
1670480	1677240	weather event is more accentuated from droughts and heatwaves to rainfall and floods.
1677240	1681160	Studies have shown the influence of global warming on these natural phenomena.
1681160	1686280	Back in 2009 this study laid the blame for recent droughts on a positive Indian Ocean
1686280	1690520	Dipole exacerbated by rising temperatures.
1690520	1696260	In the same year this paper concluded that the Indian Ocean Dipole Index has been increasing
1696260	1701600	along with regional temperatures and concluded that climate change will increase the occurrence
1701600	1704060	of positive IOD events.
1704060	1706620	Those are the ones that cause drought.
1706620	1711300	So if scientists are pointing the finger at climate change not as a cause but as an amplifier
1711300	1716780	of natural causes, making heatwaves, droughts and bushfires worse, what excuses are left
1716780	1718660	to ignore it?
1718680	1724240	Well it's the old thoughts and prayers excuse, now is not the time to talk about it.
1724240	1727880	My only thoughts today are with those who have lost their lives.
1727880	1731120	I certainly don't think it's appropriate to get into a political argument.
1731120	1734400	I'll tell you this, I'm not going to cop it and if that's the rest of this interview
1734400	1736120	we'll give lost news for the morning.
1736120	1741560	The bushfire and climate change debate, it's dumb, it's reckless, it's offensive.
1741560	1745560	Now is not the time to be talking about climate change.
1745560	1748640	So here's the problem the Australian Government faces.
1748640	1753700	It has to run a tightrope between appeasing voters who are mostly calling for action and
1753700	1758380	powerful members of its parliamentary party who either want to downplay the role of climate
1758380	1762140	change or don't even accept the basic science.
1762140	1766100	And this is the Deputy Prime Minister about to answer the question, do you agree that
1766100	1769300	there needs to be further action on climate change?
1769300	1774180	Now the answer is either yes or no, and saying no to taking action is never a good political
1774180	1779800	move, but if he says yes, he knows the follow-up question is going to be, OK, what sort of
1779800	1782640	further action will you take?
1782640	1787120	When a politician knows an uncomfortable follow-up question is coming, he'll stall it at all
1787120	1791640	costs by droning on at length about other topics without pausing for a breath so the
1791640	1794560	reporters have no chance of interrupting to ask the question again.
1794560	1796760	Let's watch the masterclass in how that's done.
1796760	1801000	There's been a lot of hysteria around climate change.
1801000	1803860	Climate change isn't the only factor that has caused these fires.
1803860	1809140	There's been dry lightning strikes, there's been self-combusting piles of manure, there's
1809140	1810860	been a lot of arsonists out there.
1810860	1813100	Ah, throw in the arsonist excuse.
1813100	1814100	Good.
1814100	1815300	You can use up to a minute on that.
1815300	1820320	Somebody who is deliberately lighting a fire to cause mischief indeed, potentially property
1820320	1825620	damage and even death, should be dobbed in to Crimestoppers on 1800 333 000.
1825620	1828020	And if somebody sees a fire...
1828040	1832660	The reason a politician rambles on like this is not because he's forgotten the question.
1832660	1837560	He's hoping the reporter will forget the question and instead follow something else the politician
1837560	1839840	mentions in his diatribe.
1839840	1842520	Or he's hoping to simply run down the clock.
1842520	1847400	The journalist would have been told by a ministerial aide that this is only a ten minute doorstop
1847400	1851240	and on the ten minute mark the aide will step in and tell the minister he's expected at
1851240	1852720	his next appointment.
1852720	1856640	So all the politician has to do is keep talking.
1856640	1857640	How's he getting on?
1857640	1860900	A person in authority that they actually heed those warnings.
1860900	1861900	Fire...
1861900	1865900	But I'll put you out of your misery.
1865900	1870580	When he eventually stopped talking the reporter asked exactly the same question again and
1870580	1874820	the Deputy Prime Minister was forced to admit that more needed to be done.
1874820	1878940	But of course the government's argument is there's no point because there's nothing we
1878940	1881060	can do about it anyway.
1881060	1887220	Australia is responsible for just 1.3% of global emissions.
1887220	1894240	The real problem it seems was that the Morrison government hadn't magically turned down the
1894240	1898220	world's temperature by cutting Australia's tiny emissions.
1898220	1903780	And even if the entire planet turned carbon neutral tomorrow we would still have summers
1903780	1907440	like this, we would still have fires like this.
1907440	1909620	For once the experts agree.
1909620	1915120	Taking action on CO2 emissions now won't stop the mega fires we're dealing with now.
1915120	1920440	The time to have taken action to avoid today's mega fires was in the 1980s when the world's
1920440	1923960	politicians first recognised the problem.
1923960	1927820	But they decided to kick the can down the road because they knew that the effects of
1927820	1933420	any CO2 reduction policies they took then would be decades away and they were more concerned
1933420	1935980	about the next general election.
1935980	1939060	And government politicians are doing the same thing today.
1939060	1944920	The effects of any policies they introduce now won't be felt for another 30 years.
1944920	1948340	And their political careers will be over by then.
1948340	1953660	When the fires abate at the end of this season and this drought finally ends, as it inevitably
1953660	1957220	will, they can proclaim that the crisis is over.
1957220	1962200	As droughts, heatwaves and mega fires continue to become more frequent and more intense they'll
1962200	1965520	just hope it'll be someone else's problem.
1965520	1972260	As for the argument that Australia only contributes 1.3% of anthropogenic CO2, that's also true.
1972260	1976700	Even if Australia stopped emitting CO2 altogether it would make very little difference to the
1976700	1979240	global warming trend.
1979240	1986440	But France is only responsible for 0.9% of the world's CO2 emissions, Germany 2.1%, Japan
1986440	1988680	3.6%.
1988680	1993160	If every country took a view that it doesn't have to do anything because its own CO2 emissions
1993160	1996880	are just a fraction of the total, nothing would ever get done.
1996880	1999720	We'd just expect China to do it alone.
1999720	2005080	And China could then use the argument that its emissions per capita are only 7.7 tonnes
2005080	2008480	a year, less than half those of Australia.
2008480	2013980	So solving an international problem requires international cooperation.
2013980	2019020	Australia has diplomatic clout in the world and shunning summit meetings on climate change
2019020	2024760	and thwarting international climate agreements by demanding privileged loopholes is not making
2024760	2029160	Australia popular and it isn't even in our own self-interest.
2029160	2033600	This country stands to benefit more than most from the energy revolution.
2033600	2038640	When an international agreement is made, South Korea and Japan want to build economies based
2038640	2045200	on hydrogen fuel made in Australia because we have a wealth of clean, renewable energy.
2045200	2049880	It's not going to cost us anything, but what is costing us is the result of government
2049880	2052660	inaction 40 years ago.
2052660	2058400	And there's nothing that Australia can or ever will do that will change the global climate.
2058400	2061180	But of course, again, scientists disagree.
2061180	2068920	Researchers since 1896 – 1896! – have shown conclusively that increasing CO2 concentration
2068920	2071180	raises global temperature.
2071180	2076540	To all those who doubt that, don't just read magazine stories, read the science.
2076540	2080560	And scientific studies have been warning for decades that this is going to increase climatic
2080560	2084400	extremes in Australia, including bushfires.
2084400	2088840	So what scientists have been urging for the last four decades is that to mitigate these
2088840	2093800	droughts, heatwaves and megafires, you need to reduce the concentration of the gas that's
2093800	2096700	making them more and more extreme.
2096700	2100000	So finally, what do I think is the cause of these bushfires?
2100000	2102100	Well, I'll tell you.
2102100	2103840	It doesn't matter.
2103840	2109160	Neither my amateur opinion nor the opinions of amateurs in videos, blogs, TV commentaries,
2109160	2113920	pubs, clubs and knitting circles matter when it comes to science.
2113920	2118580	Especially when all most amateurs are doing is simply quoting from each other and passing
2118580	2122420	round nonsense beliefs that's at variance with the facts.
2122420	2126400	So I'm going to leave the last word with one of those researchers.
2126400	2132120	I don't want to say, I told you so, no climate scientist does, but that kind of sits there.
2132120	2134740	You're like, well, this is not a surprise to us.
2134740	2138880	It's still utterly devastating and it breaks my heart to see my country on fire.
2138880	2139880	It really does.
2139880	2142720	It was just a matter of time when this perfect storm happened.
2142720	2147120	And the thing is, as we move further into the future and the climate warms even more,
2147120	2148320	what's going to happen then?
2148320	2150840	Sure, climate variability will have a role.
2150840	2151840	It always has a role.
2151840	2157760	But if it's two or three degrees hotter, not just one degree hotter, how bad can it really
2157760	2158760	get?
2158760	2160560	And I guess that's what concerns me the most.
2160560	2162800	Not how bad it is now, but how bad it will be in the future.
