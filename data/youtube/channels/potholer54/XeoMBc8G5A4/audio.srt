1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,480
OK, continuing with the people I've been asked to debunk in this Covid-19 saga,

2
00:00:05,120 --> 00:00:10,400
this name was put forward and has popped up a few times before on the forum, Dr Michael Yeadon.

3
00:00:11,120 --> 00:00:14,400
So my first question is, who the hell is Michael Yeadon?

4
00:00:14,400 --> 00:00:16,320
My name is Dr Michael Yeadon.

5
00:00:16,320 --> 00:00:17,120
Oh, you're Michael Yeadon.

6
00:00:17,120 --> 00:00:22,160
My original training was a first class honours degree in biochemistry and toxicology.

7
00:00:22,160 --> 00:00:26,160
Long story short, he's a pharmacologist and a former executive advisor.

8
00:00:26,960 --> 00:00:30,800
So let's get to the point. What's he claiming and what's his source?

9
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:34,720
SAGE took the view that since SARS-CoV-2 was a quote,

10
00:00:34,720 --> 00:00:39,840
new virus, that they believe there wouldn't be any immunity at all in the population.

11
00:00:40,400 --> 00:00:45,760
Unfortunately, Yeadon gives no source for this claim. He just says he remembers hearing it.

12
00:00:46,720 --> 00:00:51,040
Whenever someone refuses to give a source, it's a good sign that either they don't want

13
00:00:51,040 --> 00:00:55,760
people to check what they're saying or they've got a fuzzy memory and haven't checked to see

14
00:00:55,760 --> 00:01:01,120
if they remembered correctly. It's always very quick and easy to check someone's source

15
00:01:01,120 --> 00:01:06,480
and show that they've, let's call it, made a mistake. When no source is given,

16
00:01:06,480 --> 00:01:09,920
then you have to spend time and effort trawling through documents,

17
00:01:09,920 --> 00:01:15,360
trying to find the evidence for their claim. If it doesn't exist, that could take forever.

18
00:01:16,400 --> 00:01:21,920
In this case, Yeadon's comment about SAGE made no sense. After all, throughout history there

19
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:27,600
have always been people with natural immunity during any pandemic. It would seem strange for

20
00:01:27,600 --> 00:01:34,640
epidemiologists to deny this. And of course they didn't. SAGE stated quite clearly that there would

21
00:01:34,640 --> 00:01:40,240
be people immune to the virus. They even modelled how many people would have that natural resistance.

22
00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:46,400
Perhaps what Yeadon misunderstood was that SAGE said there wouldn't be enough of these people

23
00:01:46,400 --> 00:01:52,000
to stop the spread of the virus effectively, in other words herd immunity. And he got this

24
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:58,320
wrong too. You don't need masks, they don't work. Forget lockdowns, they never slow transmission.

25
00:01:58,320 --> 00:02:04,320
Once again, Yeadon gives no sources for these two claims. The only way to know whether masks

26
00:02:04,320 --> 00:02:09,760
and lockdowns work is to do proper clinical and epidemiological studies, then have them

27
00:02:09,760 --> 00:02:14,560
peer reviewed and published so that other researchers can respond, comment, confirm

28
00:02:14,560 --> 00:02:20,240
or disprove them. Yeadon hasn't done any of that, he's just made a proclamation,

29
00:02:20,240 --> 00:02:25,840
which is how religions work. But this time it's easy to cite the scientific studies,

30
00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:30,640
because I already did my homework when I made a couple of videos on these subjects last year.

31
00:02:31,520 --> 00:02:36,240
Here I showed studies that found masks are not very effective in protecting the wearer if they

32
00:02:36,240 --> 00:02:41,760
are handled incorrectly and not accompanied by frequent hand washing, but they are effective

33
00:02:41,760 --> 00:02:46,880
in preventing the wearer from spreading an infection to others. I showed this quite

34
00:02:46,880 --> 00:02:52,320
graphically in my video. Masks are even more effective in preventing infected people from

35
00:02:52,320 --> 00:02:58,480
spreading the virus. This test shows droplets, they're visible in green, emanating from someone

36
00:02:58,480 --> 00:03:05,280
just talking without a mask. Stay healthy. But wearing a mask stops that completely.

37
00:03:05,920 --> 00:03:07,120
Stay healthy.

38
00:03:07,760 --> 00:03:08,800
Louder.

39
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:10,080
Stay healthy.

40
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:15,280
I've also shown studies which all confirm the effectiveness of lockdowns in slowing

41
00:03:15,280 --> 00:03:19,680
the spread of infection, regardless of whether you think lockdowns are socially,

42
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:25,840
legally or ethically acceptable. But the most commonplace Yeadon's name came up

43
00:03:25,840 --> 00:03:29,760
was this claim that Covid vaccine is female sterilisation.

44
00:03:30,720 --> 00:03:36,160
OK, firstly, did he really say that? And if he did, based on what?

45
00:03:37,280 --> 00:03:40,080
To find out, of course, we have to follow the source trail.

46
00:03:40,880 --> 00:03:47,600
No, not the source trail, the source, the source, source trail. This Facebook image

47
00:03:47,600 --> 00:03:52,480
being passed around has the source written right there. It's a reprint of this blog

48
00:03:52,480 --> 00:03:58,480
called Health and Money News. The vaccine contains a spike protein called syncytin-1,

49
00:03:58,560 --> 00:04:03,680
vital for the formation of human placenta in women. If the vaccine works so that we form

50
00:04:03,680 --> 00:04:09,360
an immune response against the spike protein, we're also training the female body to attack

51
00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:12,960
syncytin-1, which could lead to infertility in women.

52
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:19,840
And what's the source for this claim? No prizes for guessing. It's not a peer-reviewed study

53
00:04:19,840 --> 00:04:23,600
published in a respected scientific journal. It's a petition.

54
00:04:24,560 --> 00:04:29,680
Unlike a peer-reviewed study, anyone can write a petition. I could write a petition

55
00:04:29,680 --> 00:04:32,560
claiming that vaccines cause your arm to be magnetised.

56
00:04:33,200 --> 00:04:36,880
Before you say, come on, no one would be stupid enough to believe that.

57
00:04:40,400 --> 00:04:43,920
Y'all seen that move? And there it is.

58
00:04:44,720 --> 00:04:46,240
Come closer. Sickened to my arm.

59
00:04:46,240 --> 00:04:51,120
So did the petition say the vaccine is female sterilisation?

60
00:04:52,400 --> 00:04:56,960
No, not even Yeadon would make that claim because there's no evidence for it at all.

61
00:04:57,760 --> 00:05:03,440
What Yeadon and his co-petitioner Wodagh did was cobble together a few bits of information

62
00:05:03,440 --> 00:05:09,360
that invited speculation. Several vaccine candidates are expected to induce the formation

63
00:05:09,360 --> 00:05:12,400
of humoral antibodies against the spike proteins of SARS-CoV-2.

64
00:05:12,400 --> 00:05:15,600
Hold on, let's put that into simple English and break the claim down.

65
00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:20,160
Yeadon says antibodies are trained to attack the spike protein,

66
00:05:20,160 --> 00:05:25,760
the business end of the SARS-CoV-2 virus. The spike protein contains a homologous

67
00:05:25,760 --> 00:05:29,520
form of syncytin-1. We'll see what that means in a minute.

68
00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:34,720
Syncytin-1 is also present in women to make the placenta during pregnancy.

69
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:42,480
So the antibodies may attack syncytin-1. And if they do, the placenta can't be formed.

70
00:05:42,480 --> 00:05:48,560
Result? Sterile women. Experts who work in the field of virology and immunology

71
00:05:48,560 --> 00:05:54,640
say his theory is complete nonsense. Firstly, syncytin-1 and the SARS-CoV-2

72
00:05:54,640 --> 00:06:00,400
spike protein are completely different proteins. They have different sizes, different shapes,

73
00:06:00,400 --> 00:06:06,720
and different functions, just like two different buildings. Immunologists say that it's ridiculous

74
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:11,360
to suggest that antibodies can't tell the difference. But what about Yeadon's argument

75
00:06:11,360 --> 00:06:15,360
that the spike protein contains a homologous form of syncytin-1?

76
00:06:16,400 --> 00:06:22,000
Well, that sounds impressive, but what it boils down to is that a very short amino acid

77
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:27,600
chain in the spike protein is the same as a very short amino acid chain in syncytin-1.

78
00:06:28,320 --> 00:06:33,280
Immunologists say antibodies aren't going to confuse the two, because it's a bit like

79
00:06:33,280 --> 00:06:38,080
saying that I might confuse this house with this house because they share the same type

80
00:06:38,080 --> 00:06:43,600
of Greek pediment in the middle. If there are a few overactive B-cells

81
00:06:43,600 --> 00:06:48,800
that would attack human proteins on the basis of a few identical amino acids,

82
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:53,040
the body has a way of deselecting them. It's called negative selection.

83
00:06:53,760 --> 00:06:59,600
If the body didn't have that function, then not only the immune response to SARS-CoV-2 vaccines

84
00:06:59,600 --> 00:07:05,600
would trigger an attack on our own proteins, so would every other immune response. That would

85
00:07:05,600 --> 00:07:11,120
pretty much make every woman on Earth infertile. Since we're all here, I guess that hasn't

86
00:07:11,120 --> 00:07:17,360
happened. And there's more. Not only is this small sequence of amino acids in the spike protein

87
00:07:17,360 --> 00:07:23,520
unlikely to be mistaken for syncytin-1, experts point out that the antibodies don't even attack

88
00:07:23,520 --> 00:07:29,440
that part of the spike protein anyway. So the door to the smaller house might be in the front,

89
00:07:29,440 --> 00:07:33,200
but the door to get into the bigger house is in a completely different location.

90
00:07:34,080 --> 00:07:39,680
But the biggest problem for Yeedon's claim isn't that it doesn't stack up on a theoretical level,

91
00:07:39,680 --> 00:07:46,320
he's been disproved on a practical level too. After all, lots of women caught SARS-CoV-2

92
00:07:46,320 --> 00:07:50,880
and then became pregnant, or they caught the virus in the early stages of pregnancy.

93
00:07:51,760 --> 00:07:56,560
Studies show no evidence that antibodies were blocking the formation of their placentas.

94
00:07:57,280 --> 00:08:01,600
Their chances of miscarriage were the same as women who didn't have such antibodies.

95
00:08:02,560 --> 00:08:07,440
There are also studies looking at women who were vaccinated, and again no evidence that

96
00:08:07,440 --> 00:08:12,960
their chances of miscarriage or infertility were any worse than women who weren't vaccinated.

97
00:08:13,920 --> 00:08:18,640
Two scientists who've done extensive research in this field analysed serum from women with

98
00:08:18,640 --> 00:08:25,680
COVID-19 and didn't find any reaction between patients' antibodies and syncytin-1. And this

99
00:08:25,680 --> 00:08:31,920
study not only confirmed no similarity between the amino acid sequences of the SARS-CoV-2 spike

100
00:08:31,920 --> 00:08:38,320
protein and syncytin-1, but also showed no reaction with syncytin-1 at all when it did

101
00:08:38,320 --> 00:08:44,400
an analysis of convalescent serum from patients with COVID-19. In fact, this study even found

102
00:08:44,400 --> 00:08:49,840
that a lot of vaccinated women became pregnant while participating in clinical trials even

103
00:08:49,840 --> 00:08:54,880
though they were told not to get pregnant during the trial, so you could argue that the vaccine

104
00:08:54,880 --> 00:08:59,840
increased fertility. I'm kidding! God please let's not start another myth.

105
00:09:00,880 --> 00:09:05,440
How many times and in how many different ways does this claim need to be busted?

106
00:09:07,120 --> 00:09:11,360
Even Yeedon and his co-author on the petition admit there's no evidence to support this

107
00:09:11,360 --> 00:09:16,400
speculation. There's no indication whether antibodies against spike proteins of SARS

108
00:09:16,400 --> 00:09:24,160
viruses would also act like anti-syncytin-1 antibodies. However, if this were to be the case,

109
00:09:24,160 --> 00:09:31,280
which as the research has clearly shown, it isn't. Yeedon's speculation in the petition was so weak

110
00:09:31,280 --> 00:09:36,800
that even the bloggers didn't think it was up to scratch, so they had to embellish it. It's

111
00:09:36,800 --> 00:09:42,400
obviously not much of an argument to say that the two proteins share a short string of amino acids,

112
00:09:42,400 --> 00:09:48,480
so they changed that to the spike protein is called syncytin-1, in other words they're the

113
00:09:48,480 --> 00:09:54,400
same thing. Much more convincing. And instead of there's no indication that antibodies would

114
00:09:54,400 --> 00:10:00,240
attack syncytin-1 and cause infertility, that had to be changed to COVID vaccine

115
00:10:00,240 --> 00:10:07,440
is female sterilisation. Much more definite. And that got passed around Facebook and Twitter.

116
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:13,520
How easily these myths get started. Yeedon's petition and the blogs that misquoted it

117
00:10:13,520 --> 00:10:18,960
had a huge impact. According to this research paper, internet searches on the subject of the

118
00:10:18,960 --> 00:10:24,000
vaccine causing infertility were pretty flat until the petition was launched and the blogs

119
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:30,240
were posted, then the number of internet searches ballooned. While we're dealing with myths about

120
00:10:30,240 --> 00:10:35,680
the vaccine and sterilisation, Health and Money News was also responsible for spreading another

121
00:10:35,680 --> 00:10:42,160
fanciful story headlined, Designer of COVID Vaccine admits, vaccine will only sterilise

122
00:10:42,160 --> 00:10:49,360
70% of the population. Which doesn't make much sense. Why would the designer of a leading vaccine,

123
00:10:49,360 --> 00:10:54,560
Professor John Bell, go on television to publicly announce that it will sterilise

124
00:10:54,560 --> 00:11:01,600
only 70% of the population? Was he hoping for 100%? Why is he admitting any kind of sterilisation on

125
00:11:01,600 --> 00:11:07,680
national television? A more accurate quote is in the body of the article, but it still makes no

126
00:11:07,680 --> 00:11:13,200
sense. These vaccines are unlikely to completely sterilise a population. They're very likely to

127
00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:20,080
have an effect which works in a percentage, say 60 or 70%. End quote. Believe him, someone who

128
00:11:20,080 --> 00:11:27,040
has these levels of credentials doesn't misspeak without correcting himself. The claim of course

129
00:11:27,040 --> 00:11:33,200
went viral on Facebook and Twitter, and as you'd expect, instead of being sceptical and checking

130
00:11:33,200 --> 00:11:40,640
the facts, people expressed outrage. He openly admits depopulation via sterilisation. He actually

131
00:11:40,640 --> 00:11:47,920
doesn't even realise what he's just admitted to on live TV. So did Bell inadvertently blurt out

132
00:11:47,920 --> 00:11:55,120
a secret? Did he misspeak? Or is the blogger who runs Health and Money News an idiot? Answer,

133
00:11:55,120 --> 00:12:00,800
the blogger who runs Health and Money News is an idiot. Sterilisation has several meanings,

134
00:12:00,800 --> 00:12:04,800
including the rendering of something free from viable microorganisms.

135
00:12:05,520 --> 00:12:12,160
So when a vaccine renders you free of a virus, that's called sterilisation. If a vaccine renders

136
00:12:12,160 --> 00:12:20,080
70% of the population free of a virus, then 70% of the population has been sterilised. It doesn't

137
00:12:20,080 --> 00:12:27,440
mean 70% of the population is unable to conceive children. Unless of course reproduction was the

138
00:12:27,440 --> 00:12:33,760
topic of conversation and not vaccines. There's only one way to find out. And that then tells

139
00:12:33,760 --> 00:12:38,800
you that you can look at the real vaccinated population and see whether they've been protected.

140
00:12:38,800 --> 00:12:45,200
So I'm hoping that's going to happen pretty smartly this autumn. But then don't forget,

141
00:12:46,240 --> 00:12:50,800
these vaccines are unlikely to completely sterilise a population. They're very likely

142
00:12:51,360 --> 00:12:58,640
to have an effect which works in a percentage, say 60 or 70%. We'll have to look quite carefully,

143
00:12:58,640 --> 00:13:03,200
and the regulators will have to look quite carefully to make sure that it's done what

144
00:13:03,200 --> 00:13:06,880
we need it to do before it gets approved. So there will be a delay.

145
00:13:06,880 --> 00:13:13,040
So no, Bell wasn't talking about reproductive sterilisation, he was talking about sterilisation

146
00:13:13,040 --> 00:13:19,840
from the virus. After the myth began circulating, Bell explained this himself to a fact checking

147
00:13:19,840 --> 00:13:26,240
website. I was referring to the ability of the vaccines to completely eliminate viral replication,

148
00:13:26,240 --> 00:13:32,560
i.e. sterilise, and it had no relevance to fertility. That's pretty obvious,

149
00:13:32,560 --> 00:13:37,760
but just to make sure it's not Bell who's the idiot, I checked the scientific literature,

150
00:13:37,760 --> 00:13:42,000
and sure enough this is a commonly used term in virology and immunology.

151
00:13:43,680 --> 00:13:48,480
Finally, another doctor discovered by that font of urban myths, Natural News.

152
00:13:49,360 --> 00:13:54,400
Doctor refuses to accept patients who get vaccinated for COVID-19, reads the headline.

153
00:13:55,520 --> 00:14:01,680
Why? Because he believes the myth started by Mike Eden that the vaccines cause infertility.

154
00:14:02,880 --> 00:14:11,360
A physician who goes by the name of Dr Baker has published a video explaining that he will

155
00:14:11,360 --> 00:14:16,000
no longer be accepting patients who were vaccinated for the Wuhan coronavirus.

156
00:14:16,560 --> 00:14:21,120
Dr Baker does not want to risk the health and safety of his staff and patients

157
00:14:21,120 --> 00:14:24,480
by allowing the jabbed to be in close proximity to them.

158
00:14:25,680 --> 00:14:31,040
Wait, what? A doctor believes that if you get vaccinated you're not only

159
00:14:31,040 --> 00:14:36,480
going to become infertile yourself, you're somehow going to spread that infertility

160
00:14:36,480 --> 00:14:42,000
to anyone you sit or stand next to? I'm sure Natural News must have misheard.

161
00:14:42,560 --> 00:14:49,440
I have to take a stance in order to protect the people in my office. I am not willing

162
00:14:49,440 --> 00:14:55,680
to watch somebody who made a poor decision and got the shot stand next to a young female in my office

163
00:14:55,680 --> 00:14:58,560
and risk the chance of her becoming infertile.

164
00:14:58,560 --> 00:15:02,640
No, the physician who goes by the name of Dr Baker really does believe that.

165
00:15:03,600 --> 00:15:06,000
So what's the evidence for this?

166
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:10,320
Let's talk about the size of a cell. You can't see it, right? If I were to pile up millions of

167
00:15:10,320 --> 00:15:15,200
them they'd be like this big. Well, viruses are smaller than cells. Spike proteins? I don't know.

168
00:15:16,080 --> 00:15:18,560
Are they smaller than? Nobody knows.

169
00:15:18,560 --> 00:15:25,040
Uh, point of information. Of course they know this spike protein has been intensively studied.

170
00:15:25,040 --> 00:15:30,640
Researchers know exactly what it's made of, what it does, how it does it, and of course how big

171
00:15:30,640 --> 00:15:32,560
it is. But carry on.

172
00:15:32,560 --> 00:15:38,720
All I know is that when I ask the females in my office, they are all having, not all,

173
00:15:38,720 --> 00:15:42,000
80% are having weird female cycles.

174
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:47,840
Okay, this raises a lot of interesting and frankly rather disturbing points. Firstly,

175
00:15:47,840 --> 00:15:52,480
what's the evidence that these women are having weird cycles because they sat next to a patient

176
00:15:52,480 --> 00:16:00,160
who had been vaccinated? Secondly, 80% of what? How many women were involved in this study? In

177
00:16:00,160 --> 00:16:06,240
other words, how many work at your office? Five? And thirdly, what prompted you to start asking

178
00:16:06,240 --> 00:16:12,080
your female employees about their menstrual cycles anyway? I tried to do a similar survey

179
00:16:12,080 --> 00:16:17,920
of people I know, asking women who live nearby, and the woman who works at the bakery, about their

180
00:16:17,920 --> 00:16:22,720
menstrual cycles, and they all reminded me that the restraining order is still in place.

181
00:16:23,680 --> 00:16:30,240
So who is the physician who goes by the name of Dr Baker? Well, on his website he describes himself

182
00:16:30,240 --> 00:16:36,800
as a professional speaker and an expert in healing. Okay, but does that mean you're a real

183
00:16:36,800 --> 00:16:41,840
doctor? If covering up symptoms with drugs and never actually fixing anything is what real

184
00:16:41,840 --> 00:16:49,120
doctors do, no, I'm not a real doctor. Well, by that definition most doctors aren't real doctors,

185
00:16:49,120 --> 00:16:53,200
so here's what the physician who goes by the name of Dr Baker should have said.

186
00:16:54,160 --> 00:16:59,120
If spending three years in medical school and passing exams and then two years of internship

187
00:16:59,120 --> 00:17:04,960
and then residency and passing the licensing exam to practice medicine is what real doctors do,

188
00:17:04,960 --> 00:17:12,320
then no, I'm not a real doctor. Or to put it more succinctly, I'm not a real doctor. And yet Natural

189
00:17:12,320 --> 00:17:17,600
News calls him a physician and other blogs are quite happy to quote him, as if he is a real

190
00:17:17,600 --> 00:17:23,360
doctor. Which of course will impress a lot of people, but I never care about titles anyway.

191
00:17:24,160 --> 00:17:31,200
There are only two criteria for debunking crap on the internet. First, it has to be crap. Second,

192
00:17:31,200 --> 00:17:36,400
people believe it. There's a lot of difference between the physician who goes by the name of

193
00:17:36,400 --> 00:17:42,800
Dr Baker and Dr Yeedon in terms of their qualifications, but absolutely no difference

194
00:17:42,800 --> 00:17:47,200
in the way that both are spouting nonsense on the internet and people believe them.

195
00:17:47,200 --> 00:17:51,040
First class honours degree. I know, and that sounds very impressive.

196
00:17:51,040 --> 00:17:55,920
Well I've got a third class honours degree and I came bottom of my class at school.

197
00:17:55,920 --> 00:18:00,960
It just goes to show that you don't have to be a dunce to post crap on the internet

198
00:18:00,960 --> 00:18:05,200
and you don't have to be a genius to check sources and debunk it.
