00:00.000 --> 00:04.480
OK, continuing with the people I've been asked to debunk in this Covid-19 saga,

00:05.120 --> 00:10.400
this name was put forward and has popped up a few times before on the forum, Dr Michael Yeadon.

00:11.120 --> 00:14.400
So my first question is, who the hell is Michael Yeadon?

00:14.400 --> 00:16.320
My name is Dr Michael Yeadon.

00:16.320 --> 00:17.120
Oh, you're Michael Yeadon.

00:17.120 --> 00:22.160
My original training was a first class honours degree in biochemistry and toxicology.

00:22.160 --> 00:26.160
Long story short, he's a pharmacologist and a former executive advisor.

00:26.960 --> 00:30.800
So let's get to the point. What's he claiming and what's his source?

00:30.800 --> 00:34.720
SAGE took the view that since SARS-CoV-2 was a quote,

00:34.720 --> 00:39.840
new virus, that they believe there wouldn't be any immunity at all in the population.

00:40.400 --> 00:45.760
Unfortunately, Yeadon gives no source for this claim. He just says he remembers hearing it.

00:46.720 --> 00:51.040
Whenever someone refuses to give a source, it's a good sign that either they don't want

00:51.040 --> 00:55.760
people to check what they're saying or they've got a fuzzy memory and haven't checked to see

00:55.760 --> 01:01.120
if they remembered correctly. It's always very quick and easy to check someone's source

01:01.120 --> 01:06.480
and show that they've, let's call it, made a mistake. When no source is given,

01:06.480 --> 01:09.920
then you have to spend time and effort trawling through documents,

01:09.920 --> 01:15.360
trying to find the evidence for their claim. If it doesn't exist, that could take forever.

01:16.400 --> 01:21.920
In this case, Yeadon's comment about SAGE made no sense. After all, throughout history there

01:21.920 --> 01:27.600
have always been people with natural immunity during any pandemic. It would seem strange for

01:27.600 --> 01:34.640
epidemiologists to deny this. And of course they didn't. SAGE stated quite clearly that there would

01:34.640 --> 01:40.240
be people immune to the virus. They even modelled how many people would have that natural resistance.

01:41.280 --> 01:46.400
Perhaps what Yeadon misunderstood was that SAGE said there wouldn't be enough of these people

01:46.400 --> 01:52.000
to stop the spread of the virus effectively, in other words herd immunity. And he got this

01:52.000 --> 01:58.320
wrong too. You don't need masks, they don't work. Forget lockdowns, they never slow transmission.

01:58.320 --> 02:04.320
Once again, Yeadon gives no sources for these two claims. The only way to know whether masks

02:04.320 --> 02:09.760
and lockdowns work is to do proper clinical and epidemiological studies, then have them

02:09.760 --> 02:14.560
peer reviewed and published so that other researchers can respond, comment, confirm

02:14.560 --> 02:20.240
or disprove them. Yeadon hasn't done any of that, he's just made a proclamation,

02:20.240 --> 02:25.840
which is how religions work. But this time it's easy to cite the scientific studies,

02:25.840 --> 02:30.640
because I already did my homework when I made a couple of videos on these subjects last year.

02:31.520 --> 02:36.240
Here I showed studies that found masks are not very effective in protecting the wearer if they

02:36.240 --> 02:41.760
are handled incorrectly and not accompanied by frequent hand washing, but they are effective

02:41.760 --> 02:46.880
in preventing the wearer from spreading an infection to others. I showed this quite

02:46.880 --> 02:52.320
graphically in my video. Masks are even more effective in preventing infected people from

02:52.320 --> 02:58.480
spreading the virus. This test shows droplets, they're visible in green, emanating from someone

02:58.480 --> 03:05.280
just talking without a mask. Stay healthy. But wearing a mask stops that completely.

03:05.920 --> 03:07.120
Stay healthy.

03:07.760 --> 03:08.800
Louder.

03:08.800 --> 03:10.080
Stay healthy.

03:10.800 --> 03:15.280
I've also shown studies which all confirm the effectiveness of lockdowns in slowing

03:15.280 --> 03:19.680
the spread of infection, regardless of whether you think lockdowns are socially,

03:19.680 --> 03:25.840
legally or ethically acceptable. But the most commonplace Yeadon's name came up

03:25.840 --> 03:29.760
was this claim that Covid vaccine is female sterilisation.

03:30.720 --> 03:36.160
OK, firstly, did he really say that? And if he did, based on what?

03:37.280 --> 03:40.080
To find out, of course, we have to follow the source trail.

03:40.880 --> 03:47.600
No, not the source trail, the source, the source, source trail. This Facebook image

03:47.600 --> 03:52.480
being passed around has the source written right there. It's a reprint of this blog

03:52.480 --> 03:58.480
called Health and Money News. The vaccine contains a spike protein called syncytin-1,

03:58.560 --> 04:03.680
vital for the formation of human placenta in women. If the vaccine works so that we form

04:03.680 --> 04:09.360
an immune response against the spike protein, we're also training the female body to attack

04:09.360 --> 04:12.960
syncytin-1, which could lead to infertility in women.

04:14.000 --> 04:19.840
And what's the source for this claim? No prizes for guessing. It's not a peer-reviewed study

04:19.840 --> 04:23.600
published in a respected scientific journal. It's a petition.

04:24.560 --> 04:29.680
Unlike a peer-reviewed study, anyone can write a petition. I could write a petition

04:29.680 --> 04:32.560
claiming that vaccines cause your arm to be magnetised.

04:33.200 --> 04:36.880
Before you say, come on, no one would be stupid enough to believe that.

04:40.400 --> 04:43.920
Y'all seen that move? And there it is.

04:44.720 --> 04:46.240
Come closer. Sickened to my arm.

04:46.240 --> 04:51.120
So did the petition say the vaccine is female sterilisation?

04:52.400 --> 04:56.960
No, not even Yeadon would make that claim because there's no evidence for it at all.

04:57.760 --> 05:03.440
What Yeadon and his co-petitioner Wodagh did was cobble together a few bits of information

05:03.440 --> 05:09.360
that invited speculation. Several vaccine candidates are expected to induce the formation

05:09.360 --> 05:12.400
of humoral antibodies against the spike proteins of SARS-CoV-2.

05:12.400 --> 05:15.600
Hold on, let's put that into simple English and break the claim down.

05:16.560 --> 05:20.160
Yeadon says antibodies are trained to attack the spike protein,

05:20.160 --> 05:25.760
the business end of the SARS-CoV-2 virus. The spike protein contains a homologous

05:25.760 --> 05:29.520
form of syncytin-1. We'll see what that means in a minute.

05:30.160 --> 05:34.720
Syncytin-1 is also present in women to make the placenta during pregnancy.

05:35.600 --> 05:42.480
So the antibodies may attack syncytin-1. And if they do, the placenta can't be formed.

05:42.480 --> 05:48.560
Result? Sterile women. Experts who work in the field of virology and immunology

05:48.560 --> 05:54.640
say his theory is complete nonsense. Firstly, syncytin-1 and the SARS-CoV-2

05:54.640 --> 06:00.400
spike protein are completely different proteins. They have different sizes, different shapes,

06:00.400 --> 06:06.720
and different functions, just like two different buildings. Immunologists say that it's ridiculous

06:06.720 --> 06:11.360
to suggest that antibodies can't tell the difference. But what about Yeadon's argument

06:11.360 --> 06:15.360
that the spike protein contains a homologous form of syncytin-1?

06:16.400 --> 06:22.000
Well, that sounds impressive, but what it boils down to is that a very short amino acid

06:22.000 --> 06:27.600
chain in the spike protein is the same as a very short amino acid chain in syncytin-1.

06:28.320 --> 06:33.280
Immunologists say antibodies aren't going to confuse the two, because it's a bit like

06:33.280 --> 06:38.080
saying that I might confuse this house with this house because they share the same type

06:38.080 --> 06:43.600
of Greek pediment in the middle. If there are a few overactive B-cells

06:43.600 --> 06:48.800
that would attack human proteins on the basis of a few identical amino acids,

06:48.800 --> 06:53.040
the body has a way of deselecting them. It's called negative selection.

06:53.760 --> 06:59.600
If the body didn't have that function, then not only the immune response to SARS-CoV-2 vaccines

06:59.600 --> 07:05.600
would trigger an attack on our own proteins, so would every other immune response. That would

07:05.600 --> 07:11.120
pretty much make every woman on Earth infertile. Since we're all here, I guess that hasn't

07:11.120 --> 07:17.360
happened. And there's more. Not only is this small sequence of amino acids in the spike protein

07:17.360 --> 07:23.520
unlikely to be mistaken for syncytin-1, experts point out that the antibodies don't even attack

07:23.520 --> 07:29.440
that part of the spike protein anyway. So the door to the smaller house might be in the front,

07:29.440 --> 07:33.200
but the door to get into the bigger house is in a completely different location.

07:34.080 --> 07:39.680
But the biggest problem for Yeedon's claim isn't that it doesn't stack up on a theoretical level,

07:39.680 --> 07:46.320
he's been disproved on a practical level too. After all, lots of women caught SARS-CoV-2

07:46.320 --> 07:50.880
and then became pregnant, or they caught the virus in the early stages of pregnancy.

07:51.760 --> 07:56.560
Studies show no evidence that antibodies were blocking the formation of their placentas.

07:57.280 --> 08:01.600
Their chances of miscarriage were the same as women who didn't have such antibodies.

08:02.560 --> 08:07.440
There are also studies looking at women who were vaccinated, and again no evidence that

08:07.440 --> 08:12.960
their chances of miscarriage or infertility were any worse than women who weren't vaccinated.

08:13.920 --> 08:18.640
Two scientists who've done extensive research in this field analysed serum from women with

08:18.640 --> 08:25.680
COVID-19 and didn't find any reaction between patients' antibodies and syncytin-1. And this

08:25.680 --> 08:31.920
study not only confirmed no similarity between the amino acid sequences of the SARS-CoV-2 spike

08:31.920 --> 08:38.320
protein and syncytin-1, but also showed no reaction with syncytin-1 at all when it did

08:38.320 --> 08:44.400
an analysis of convalescent serum from patients with COVID-19. In fact, this study even found

08:44.400 --> 08:49.840
that a lot of vaccinated women became pregnant while participating in clinical trials even

08:49.840 --> 08:54.880
though they were told not to get pregnant during the trial, so you could argue that the vaccine

08:54.880 --> 08:59.840
increased fertility. I'm kidding! God please let's not start another myth.

09:00.880 --> 09:05.440
How many times and in how many different ways does this claim need to be busted?

09:07.120 --> 09:11.360
Even Yeedon and his co-author on the petition admit there's no evidence to support this

09:11.360 --> 09:16.400
speculation. There's no indication whether antibodies against spike proteins of SARS

09:16.400 --> 09:24.160
viruses would also act like anti-syncytin-1 antibodies. However, if this were to be the case,

09:24.160 --> 09:31.280
which as the research has clearly shown, it isn't. Yeedon's speculation in the petition was so weak

09:31.280 --> 09:36.800
that even the bloggers didn't think it was up to scratch, so they had to embellish it. It's

09:36.800 --> 09:42.400
obviously not much of an argument to say that the two proteins share a short string of amino acids,

09:42.400 --> 09:48.480
so they changed that to the spike protein is called syncytin-1, in other words they're the

09:48.480 --> 09:54.400
same thing. Much more convincing. And instead of there's no indication that antibodies would

09:54.400 --> 10:00.240
attack syncytin-1 and cause infertility, that had to be changed to COVID vaccine

10:00.240 --> 10:07.440
is female sterilisation. Much more definite. And that got passed around Facebook and Twitter.

10:07.440 --> 10:13.520
How easily these myths get started. Yeedon's petition and the blogs that misquoted it

10:13.520 --> 10:18.960
had a huge impact. According to this research paper, internet searches on the subject of the

10:18.960 --> 10:24.000
vaccine causing infertility were pretty flat until the petition was launched and the blogs

10:24.000 --> 10:30.240
were posted, then the number of internet searches ballooned. While we're dealing with myths about

10:30.240 --> 10:35.680
the vaccine and sterilisation, Health and Money News was also responsible for spreading another

10:35.680 --> 10:42.160
fanciful story headlined, Designer of COVID Vaccine admits, vaccine will only sterilise

10:42.160 --> 10:49.360
70% of the population. Which doesn't make much sense. Why would the designer of a leading vaccine,

10:49.360 --> 10:54.560
Professor John Bell, go on television to publicly announce that it will sterilise

10:54.560 --> 11:01.600
only 70% of the population? Was he hoping for 100%? Why is he admitting any kind of sterilisation on

11:01.600 --> 11:07.680
national television? A more accurate quote is in the body of the article, but it still makes no

11:07.680 --> 11:13.200
sense. These vaccines are unlikely to completely sterilise a population. They're very likely to

11:13.200 --> 11:20.080
have an effect which works in a percentage, say 60 or 70%. End quote. Believe him, someone who

11:20.080 --> 11:27.040
has these levels of credentials doesn't misspeak without correcting himself. The claim of course

11:27.040 --> 11:33.200
went viral on Facebook and Twitter, and as you'd expect, instead of being sceptical and checking

11:33.200 --> 11:40.640
the facts, people expressed outrage. He openly admits depopulation via sterilisation. He actually

11:40.640 --> 11:47.920
doesn't even realise what he's just admitted to on live TV. So did Bell inadvertently blurt out

11:47.920 --> 11:55.120
a secret? Did he misspeak? Or is the blogger who runs Health and Money News an idiot? Answer,

11:55.120 --> 12:00.800
the blogger who runs Health and Money News is an idiot. Sterilisation has several meanings,

12:00.800 --> 12:04.800
including the rendering of something free from viable microorganisms.

12:05.520 --> 12:12.160
So when a vaccine renders you free of a virus, that's called sterilisation. If a vaccine renders

12:12.160 --> 12:20.080
70% of the population free of a virus, then 70% of the population has been sterilised. It doesn't

12:20.080 --> 12:27.440
mean 70% of the population is unable to conceive children. Unless of course reproduction was the

12:27.440 --> 12:33.760
topic of conversation and not vaccines. There's only one way to find out. And that then tells

12:33.760 --> 12:38.800
you that you can look at the real vaccinated population and see whether they've been protected.

12:38.800 --> 12:45.200
So I'm hoping that's going to happen pretty smartly this autumn. But then don't forget,

12:46.240 --> 12:50.800
these vaccines are unlikely to completely sterilise a population. They're very likely

12:51.360 --> 12:58.640
to have an effect which works in a percentage, say 60 or 70%. We'll have to look quite carefully,

12:58.640 --> 13:03.200
and the regulators will have to look quite carefully to make sure that it's done what

13:03.200 --> 13:06.880
we need it to do before it gets approved. So there will be a delay.

13:06.880 --> 13:13.040
So no, Bell wasn't talking about reproductive sterilisation, he was talking about sterilisation

13:13.040 --> 13:19.840
from the virus. After the myth began circulating, Bell explained this himself to a fact checking

13:19.840 --> 13:26.240
website. I was referring to the ability of the vaccines to completely eliminate viral replication,

13:26.240 --> 13:32.560
i.e. sterilise, and it had no relevance to fertility. That's pretty obvious,

13:32.560 --> 13:37.760
but just to make sure it's not Bell who's the idiot, I checked the scientific literature,

13:37.760 --> 13:42.000
and sure enough this is a commonly used term in virology and immunology.

13:43.680 --> 13:48.480
Finally, another doctor discovered by that font of urban myths, Natural News.

13:49.360 --> 13:54.400
Doctor refuses to accept patients who get vaccinated for COVID-19, reads the headline.

13:55.520 --> 14:01.680
Why? Because he believes the myth started by Mike Eden that the vaccines cause infertility.

14:02.880 --> 14:11.360
A physician who goes by the name of Dr Baker has published a video explaining that he will

14:11.360 --> 14:16.000
no longer be accepting patients who were vaccinated for the Wuhan coronavirus.

14:16.560 --> 14:21.120
Dr Baker does not want to risk the health and safety of his staff and patients

14:21.120 --> 14:24.480
by allowing the jabbed to be in close proximity to them.

14:25.680 --> 14:31.040
Wait, what? A doctor believes that if you get vaccinated you're not only

14:31.040 --> 14:36.480
going to become infertile yourself, you're somehow going to spread that infertility

14:36.480 --> 14:42.000
to anyone you sit or stand next to? I'm sure Natural News must have misheard.

14:42.560 --> 14:49.440
I have to take a stance in order to protect the people in my office. I am not willing

14:49.440 --> 14:55.680
to watch somebody who made a poor decision and got the shot stand next to a young female in my office

14:55.680 --> 14:58.560
and risk the chance of her becoming infertile.

14:58.560 --> 15:02.640
No, the physician who goes by the name of Dr Baker really does believe that.

15:03.600 --> 15:06.000
So what's the evidence for this?

15:06.000 --> 15:10.320
Let's talk about the size of a cell. You can't see it, right? If I were to pile up millions of

15:10.320 --> 15:15.200
them they'd be like this big. Well, viruses are smaller than cells. Spike proteins? I don't know.

15:16.080 --> 15:18.560
Are they smaller than? Nobody knows.

15:18.560 --> 15:25.040
Uh, point of information. Of course they know this spike protein has been intensively studied.

15:25.040 --> 15:30.640
Researchers know exactly what it's made of, what it does, how it does it, and of course how big

15:30.640 --> 15:32.560
it is. But carry on.

15:32.560 --> 15:38.720
All I know is that when I ask the females in my office, they are all having, not all,

15:38.720 --> 15:42.000
80% are having weird female cycles.

15:42.000 --> 15:47.840
Okay, this raises a lot of interesting and frankly rather disturbing points. Firstly,

15:47.840 --> 15:52.480
what's the evidence that these women are having weird cycles because they sat next to a patient

15:52.480 --> 16:00.160
who had been vaccinated? Secondly, 80% of what? How many women were involved in this study? In

16:00.160 --> 16:06.240
other words, how many work at your office? Five? And thirdly, what prompted you to start asking

16:06.240 --> 16:12.080
your female employees about their menstrual cycles anyway? I tried to do a similar survey

16:12.080 --> 16:17.920
of people I know, asking women who live nearby, and the woman who works at the bakery, about their

16:17.920 --> 16:22.720
menstrual cycles, and they all reminded me that the restraining order is still in place.

16:23.680 --> 16:30.240
So who is the physician who goes by the name of Dr Baker? Well, on his website he describes himself

16:30.240 --> 16:36.800
as a professional speaker and an expert in healing. Okay, but does that mean you're a real

16:36.800 --> 16:41.840
doctor? If covering up symptoms with drugs and never actually fixing anything is what real

16:41.840 --> 16:49.120
doctors do, no, I'm not a real doctor. Well, by that definition most doctors aren't real doctors,

16:49.120 --> 16:53.200
so here's what the physician who goes by the name of Dr Baker should have said.

16:54.160 --> 16:59.120
If spending three years in medical school and passing exams and then two years of internship

16:59.120 --> 17:04.960
and then residency and passing the licensing exam to practice medicine is what real doctors do,

17:04.960 --> 17:12.320
then no, I'm not a real doctor. Or to put it more succinctly, I'm not a real doctor. And yet Natural

17:12.320 --> 17:17.600
News calls him a physician and other blogs are quite happy to quote him, as if he is a real

17:17.600 --> 17:23.360
doctor. Which of course will impress a lot of people, but I never care about titles anyway.

17:24.160 --> 17:31.200
There are only two criteria for debunking crap on the internet. First, it has to be crap. Second,

17:31.200 --> 17:36.400
people believe it. There's a lot of difference between the physician who goes by the name of

17:36.400 --> 17:42.800
Dr Baker and Dr Yeedon in terms of their qualifications, but absolutely no difference

17:42.800 --> 17:47.200
in the way that both are spouting nonsense on the internet and people believe them.

17:47.200 --> 17:51.040
First class honours degree. I know, and that sounds very impressive.

17:51.040 --> 17:55.920
Well I've got a third class honours degree and I came bottom of my class at school.

17:55.920 --> 18:00.960
It just goes to show that you don't have to be a dunce to post crap on the internet

18:00.960 --> 18:05.200
and you don't have to be a genius to check sources and debunk it.
