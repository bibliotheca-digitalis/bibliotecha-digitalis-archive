0	4480	OK, continuing with the people I've been asked to debunk in this Covid-19 saga,
5120	10400	this name was put forward and has popped up a few times before on the forum, Dr Michael Yeadon.
11120	14400	So my first question is, who the hell is Michael Yeadon?
14400	16320	My name is Dr Michael Yeadon.
16320	17120	Oh, you're Michael Yeadon.
17120	22160	My original training was a first class honours degree in biochemistry and toxicology.
22160	26160	Long story short, he's a pharmacologist and a former executive advisor.
26960	30800	So let's get to the point. What's he claiming and what's his source?
30800	34720	SAGE took the view that since SARS-CoV-2 was a quote,
34720	39840	new virus, that they believe there wouldn't be any immunity at all in the population.
40400	45760	Unfortunately, Yeadon gives no source for this claim. He just says he remembers hearing it.
46720	51040	Whenever someone refuses to give a source, it's a good sign that either they don't want
51040	55760	people to check what they're saying or they've got a fuzzy memory and haven't checked to see
55760	61120	if they remembered correctly. It's always very quick and easy to check someone's source
61120	66480	and show that they've, let's call it, made a mistake. When no source is given,
66480	69920	then you have to spend time and effort trawling through documents,
69920	75360	trying to find the evidence for their claim. If it doesn't exist, that could take forever.
76400	81920	In this case, Yeadon's comment about SAGE made no sense. After all, throughout history there
81920	87600	have always been people with natural immunity during any pandemic. It would seem strange for
87600	94640	epidemiologists to deny this. And of course they didn't. SAGE stated quite clearly that there would
94640	100240	be people immune to the virus. They even modelled how many people would have that natural resistance.
101280	106400	Perhaps what Yeadon misunderstood was that SAGE said there wouldn't be enough of these people
106400	112000	to stop the spread of the virus effectively, in other words herd immunity. And he got this
112000	118320	wrong too. You don't need masks, they don't work. Forget lockdowns, they never slow transmission.
118320	124320	Once again, Yeadon gives no sources for these two claims. The only way to know whether masks
124320	129760	and lockdowns work is to do proper clinical and epidemiological studies, then have them
129760	134560	peer reviewed and published so that other researchers can respond, comment, confirm
134560	140240	or disprove them. Yeadon hasn't done any of that, he's just made a proclamation,
140240	145840	which is how religions work. But this time it's easy to cite the scientific studies,
145840	150640	because I already did my homework when I made a couple of videos on these subjects last year.
151520	156240	Here I showed studies that found masks are not very effective in protecting the wearer if they
156240	161760	are handled incorrectly and not accompanied by frequent hand washing, but they are effective
161760	166880	in preventing the wearer from spreading an infection to others. I showed this quite
166880	172320	graphically in my video. Masks are even more effective in preventing infected people from
172320	178480	spreading the virus. This test shows droplets, they're visible in green, emanating from someone
178480	185280	just talking without a mask. Stay healthy. But wearing a mask stops that completely.
185920	187120	Stay healthy.
187760	188800	Louder.
188800	190080	Stay healthy.
190800	195280	I've also shown studies which all confirm the effectiveness of lockdowns in slowing
195280	199680	the spread of infection, regardless of whether you think lockdowns are socially,
199680	205840	legally or ethically acceptable. But the most commonplace Yeadon's name came up
205840	209760	was this claim that Covid vaccine is female sterilisation.
210720	216160	OK, firstly, did he really say that? And if he did, based on what?
217280	220080	To find out, of course, we have to follow the source trail.
220880	227600	No, not the source trail, the source, the source, source trail. This Facebook image
227600	232480	being passed around has the source written right there. It's a reprint of this blog
232480	238480	called Health and Money News. The vaccine contains a spike protein called syncytin-1,
238560	243680	vital for the formation of human placenta in women. If the vaccine works so that we form
243680	249360	an immune response against the spike protein, we're also training the female body to attack
249360	252960	syncytin-1, which could lead to infertility in women.
254000	259840	And what's the source for this claim? No prizes for guessing. It's not a peer-reviewed study
259840	263600	published in a respected scientific journal. It's a petition.
264560	269680	Unlike a peer-reviewed study, anyone can write a petition. I could write a petition
269680	272560	claiming that vaccines cause your arm to be magnetised.
273200	276880	Before you say, come on, no one would be stupid enough to believe that.
280400	283920	Y'all seen that move? And there it is.
284720	286240	Come closer. Sickened to my arm.
286240	291120	So did the petition say the vaccine is female sterilisation?
292400	296960	No, not even Yeadon would make that claim because there's no evidence for it at all.
297760	303440	What Yeadon and his co-petitioner Wodagh did was cobble together a few bits of information
303440	309360	that invited speculation. Several vaccine candidates are expected to induce the formation
309360	312400	of humoral antibodies against the spike proteins of SARS-CoV-2.
312400	315600	Hold on, let's put that into simple English and break the claim down.
316560	320160	Yeadon says antibodies are trained to attack the spike protein,
320160	325760	the business end of the SARS-CoV-2 virus. The spike protein contains a homologous
325760	329520	form of syncytin-1. We'll see what that means in a minute.
330160	334720	Syncytin-1 is also present in women to make the placenta during pregnancy.
335600	342480	So the antibodies may attack syncytin-1. And if they do, the placenta can't be formed.
342480	348560	Result? Sterile women. Experts who work in the field of virology and immunology
348560	354640	say his theory is complete nonsense. Firstly, syncytin-1 and the SARS-CoV-2
354640	360400	spike protein are completely different proteins. They have different sizes, different shapes,
360400	366720	and different functions, just like two different buildings. Immunologists say that it's ridiculous
366720	371360	to suggest that antibodies can't tell the difference. But what about Yeadon's argument
371360	375360	that the spike protein contains a homologous form of syncytin-1?
376400	382000	Well, that sounds impressive, but what it boils down to is that a very short amino acid
382000	387600	chain in the spike protein is the same as a very short amino acid chain in syncytin-1.
388320	393280	Immunologists say antibodies aren't going to confuse the two, because it's a bit like
393280	398080	saying that I might confuse this house with this house because they share the same type
398080	403600	of Greek pediment in the middle. If there are a few overactive B-cells
403600	408800	that would attack human proteins on the basis of a few identical amino acids,
408800	413040	the body has a way of deselecting them. It's called negative selection.
413760	419600	If the body didn't have that function, then not only the immune response to SARS-CoV-2 vaccines
419600	425600	would trigger an attack on our own proteins, so would every other immune response. That would
425600	431120	pretty much make every woman on Earth infertile. Since we're all here, I guess that hasn't
431120	437360	happened. And there's more. Not only is this small sequence of amino acids in the spike protein
437360	443520	unlikely to be mistaken for syncytin-1, experts point out that the antibodies don't even attack
443520	449440	that part of the spike protein anyway. So the door to the smaller house might be in the front,
449440	453200	but the door to get into the bigger house is in a completely different location.
454080	459680	But the biggest problem for Yeedon's claim isn't that it doesn't stack up on a theoretical level,
459680	466320	he's been disproved on a practical level too. After all, lots of women caught SARS-CoV-2
466320	470880	and then became pregnant, or they caught the virus in the early stages of pregnancy.
471760	476560	Studies show no evidence that antibodies were blocking the formation of their placentas.
477280	481600	Their chances of miscarriage were the same as women who didn't have such antibodies.
482560	487440	There are also studies looking at women who were vaccinated, and again no evidence that
487440	492960	their chances of miscarriage or infertility were any worse than women who weren't vaccinated.
493920	498640	Two scientists who've done extensive research in this field analysed serum from women with
498640	505680	COVID-19 and didn't find any reaction between patients' antibodies and syncytin-1. And this
505680	511920	study not only confirmed no similarity between the amino acid sequences of the SARS-CoV-2 spike
511920	518320	protein and syncytin-1, but also showed no reaction with syncytin-1 at all when it did
518320	524400	an analysis of convalescent serum from patients with COVID-19. In fact, this study even found
524400	529840	that a lot of vaccinated women became pregnant while participating in clinical trials even
529840	534880	though they were told not to get pregnant during the trial, so you could argue that the vaccine
534880	539840	increased fertility. I'm kidding! God please let's not start another myth.
540880	545440	How many times and in how many different ways does this claim need to be busted?
547120	551360	Even Yeedon and his co-author on the petition admit there's no evidence to support this
551360	556400	speculation. There's no indication whether antibodies against spike proteins of SARS
556400	564160	viruses would also act like anti-syncytin-1 antibodies. However, if this were to be the case,
564160	571280	which as the research has clearly shown, it isn't. Yeedon's speculation in the petition was so weak
571280	576800	that even the bloggers didn't think it was up to scratch, so they had to embellish it. It's
576800	582400	obviously not much of an argument to say that the two proteins share a short string of amino acids,
582400	588480	so they changed that to the spike protein is called syncytin-1, in other words they're the
588480	594400	same thing. Much more convincing. And instead of there's no indication that antibodies would
594400	600240	attack syncytin-1 and cause infertility, that had to be changed to COVID vaccine
600240	607440	is female sterilisation. Much more definite. And that got passed around Facebook and Twitter.
607440	613520	How easily these myths get started. Yeedon's petition and the blogs that misquoted it
613520	618960	had a huge impact. According to this research paper, internet searches on the subject of the
618960	624000	vaccine causing infertility were pretty flat until the petition was launched and the blogs
624000	630240	were posted, then the number of internet searches ballooned. While we're dealing with myths about
630240	635680	the vaccine and sterilisation, Health and Money News was also responsible for spreading another
635680	642160	fanciful story headlined, Designer of COVID Vaccine admits, vaccine will only sterilise
642160	649360	70% of the population. Which doesn't make much sense. Why would the designer of a leading vaccine,
649360	654560	Professor John Bell, go on television to publicly announce that it will sterilise
654560	661600	only 70% of the population? Was he hoping for 100%? Why is he admitting any kind of sterilisation on
661600	667680	national television? A more accurate quote is in the body of the article, but it still makes no
667680	673200	sense. These vaccines are unlikely to completely sterilise a population. They're very likely to
673200	680080	have an effect which works in a percentage, say 60 or 70%. End quote. Believe him, someone who
680080	687040	has these levels of credentials doesn't misspeak without correcting himself. The claim of course
687040	693200	went viral on Facebook and Twitter, and as you'd expect, instead of being sceptical and checking
693200	700640	the facts, people expressed outrage. He openly admits depopulation via sterilisation. He actually
700640	707920	doesn't even realise what he's just admitted to on live TV. So did Bell inadvertently blurt out
707920	715120	a secret? Did he misspeak? Or is the blogger who runs Health and Money News an idiot? Answer,
715120	720800	the blogger who runs Health and Money News is an idiot. Sterilisation has several meanings,
720800	724800	including the rendering of something free from viable microorganisms.
725520	732160	So when a vaccine renders you free of a virus, that's called sterilisation. If a vaccine renders
732160	740080	70% of the population free of a virus, then 70% of the population has been sterilised. It doesn't
740080	747440	mean 70% of the population is unable to conceive children. Unless of course reproduction was the
747440	753760	topic of conversation and not vaccines. There's only one way to find out. And that then tells
753760	758800	you that you can look at the real vaccinated population and see whether they've been protected.
758800	765200	So I'm hoping that's going to happen pretty smartly this autumn. But then don't forget,
766240	770800	these vaccines are unlikely to completely sterilise a population. They're very likely
771360	778640	to have an effect which works in a percentage, say 60 or 70%. We'll have to look quite carefully,
778640	783200	and the regulators will have to look quite carefully to make sure that it's done what
783200	786880	we need it to do before it gets approved. So there will be a delay.
786880	793040	So no, Bell wasn't talking about reproductive sterilisation, he was talking about sterilisation
793040	799840	from the virus. After the myth began circulating, Bell explained this himself to a fact checking
799840	806240	website. I was referring to the ability of the vaccines to completely eliminate viral replication,
806240	812560	i.e. sterilise, and it had no relevance to fertility. That's pretty obvious,
812560	817760	but just to make sure it's not Bell who's the idiot, I checked the scientific literature,
817760	822000	and sure enough this is a commonly used term in virology and immunology.
823680	828480	Finally, another doctor discovered by that font of urban myths, Natural News.
829360	834400	Doctor refuses to accept patients who get vaccinated for COVID-19, reads the headline.
835520	841680	Why? Because he believes the myth started by Mike Eden that the vaccines cause infertility.
842880	851360	A physician who goes by the name of Dr Baker has published a video explaining that he will
851360	856000	no longer be accepting patients who were vaccinated for the Wuhan coronavirus.
856560	861120	Dr Baker does not want to risk the health and safety of his staff and patients
861120	864480	by allowing the jabbed to be in close proximity to them.
865680	871040	Wait, what? A doctor believes that if you get vaccinated you're not only
871040	876480	going to become infertile yourself, you're somehow going to spread that infertility
876480	882000	to anyone you sit or stand next to? I'm sure Natural News must have misheard.
882560	889440	I have to take a stance in order to protect the people in my office. I am not willing
889440	895680	to watch somebody who made a poor decision and got the shot stand next to a young female in my office
895680	898560	and risk the chance of her becoming infertile.
898560	902640	No, the physician who goes by the name of Dr Baker really does believe that.
903600	906000	So what's the evidence for this?
906000	910320	Let's talk about the size of a cell. You can't see it, right? If I were to pile up millions of
910320	915200	them they'd be like this big. Well, viruses are smaller than cells. Spike proteins? I don't know.
916080	918560	Are they smaller than? Nobody knows.
918560	925040	Uh, point of information. Of course they know this spike protein has been intensively studied.
925040	930640	Researchers know exactly what it's made of, what it does, how it does it, and of course how big
930640	932560	it is. But carry on.
932560	938720	All I know is that when I ask the females in my office, they are all having, not all,
938720	942000	80% are having weird female cycles.
942000	947840	Okay, this raises a lot of interesting and frankly rather disturbing points. Firstly,
947840	952480	what's the evidence that these women are having weird cycles because they sat next to a patient
952480	960160	who had been vaccinated? Secondly, 80% of what? How many women were involved in this study? In
960160	966240	other words, how many work at your office? Five? And thirdly, what prompted you to start asking
966240	972080	your female employees about their menstrual cycles anyway? I tried to do a similar survey
972080	977920	of people I know, asking women who live nearby, and the woman who works at the bakery, about their
977920	982720	menstrual cycles, and they all reminded me that the restraining order is still in place.
983680	990240	So who is the physician who goes by the name of Dr Baker? Well, on his website he describes himself
990240	996800	as a professional speaker and an expert in healing. Okay, but does that mean you're a real
996800	1001840	doctor? If covering up symptoms with drugs and never actually fixing anything is what real
1001840	1009120	doctors do, no, I'm not a real doctor. Well, by that definition most doctors aren't real doctors,
1009120	1013200	so here's what the physician who goes by the name of Dr Baker should have said.
1014160	1019120	If spending three years in medical school and passing exams and then two years of internship
1019120	1024960	and then residency and passing the licensing exam to practice medicine is what real doctors do,
1024960	1032320	then no, I'm not a real doctor. Or to put it more succinctly, I'm not a real doctor. And yet Natural
1032320	1037600	News calls him a physician and other blogs are quite happy to quote him, as if he is a real
1037600	1043360	doctor. Which of course will impress a lot of people, but I never care about titles anyway.
1044160	1051200	There are only two criteria for debunking crap on the internet. First, it has to be crap. Second,
1051200	1056400	people believe it. There's a lot of difference between the physician who goes by the name of
1056400	1062800	Dr Baker and Dr Yeedon in terms of their qualifications, but absolutely no difference
1062800	1067200	in the way that both are spouting nonsense on the internet and people believe them.
1067200	1071040	First class honours degree. I know, and that sounds very impressive.
1071040	1075920	Well I've got a third class honours degree and I came bottom of my class at school.
1075920	1080960	It just goes to show that you don't have to be a dunce to post crap on the internet
1080960	1085200	and you don't have to be a genius to check sources and debunk it.
