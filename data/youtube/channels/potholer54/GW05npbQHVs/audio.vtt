00:00.000 --> 00:03.000
A very rich lady wants to get rid of her husband.

00:03.000 --> 00:07.000
He's a rat. He beats her up. He's just a nasty dude.

00:07.000 --> 00:10.000
She wants to get rid of him. She's going to pay you ten million dollars.

00:10.000 --> 00:13.000
All you have to do, when she takes him out of her room,

00:13.000 --> 00:18.000
is step through a door where you've been hiding, drop an arsenic pill into his coffee,

00:18.000 --> 00:21.000
and you get ten million dollars.

00:21.000 --> 00:24.000
Would you do it? And you will not get caught, once again, for sure.

00:24.000 --> 00:25.000
Yes.

00:25.000 --> 00:26.000
What about you?

00:26.000 --> 00:27.000
Do it for free.

00:27.000 --> 00:28.000
Don't cut it out.

00:28.000 --> 00:29.000
No, I would.

00:29.000 --> 00:31.000
You'd kill a guy if he was a rat?

00:31.000 --> 00:34.000
Yeah, if he was evil enough and he did the bad things.

00:34.000 --> 00:36.000
Just take him out.

00:36.000 --> 00:39.000
Remind me never to upset you.

00:39.000 --> 00:41.000
And he's your friend?

00:41.000 --> 00:42.000
Yes, yes.

00:42.000 --> 00:43.000
Be nice to him, okay?

00:43.000 --> 00:46.000
So, um, would you do it for ten million dollars?

00:46.000 --> 00:47.000
Yes.

00:47.000 --> 00:50.000
So you would become a murderer for ten million dollars?

00:50.000 --> 00:55.000
The guy asking the questions here is Ray Comfort, better known as Banana Man.

00:55.000 --> 00:58.000
He's posing an interesting ethical question.

00:58.000 --> 01:04.000
If a nasty dude is beating up his wife, would you kill him if all you had to do was put poison in his drink

01:04.000 --> 01:06.000
and you were guaranteed not to get caught?

01:06.000 --> 01:11.000
There are all sorts of reasons why people might say yes to this question.

01:11.000 --> 01:15.000
Perhaps they imagine the woman is in danger of being killed or maimed.

01:15.000 --> 01:19.000
A lot of women do kill abusive husbands in fear of their lives,

01:19.000 --> 01:22.000
and the courts often deal with them very leniently.

01:22.000 --> 01:25.000
Comfort throws in a sweetener of ten million dollars.

01:25.000 --> 01:29.000
But as the guy on the left, Lorenzo, says, he'd do it for free.

01:29.000 --> 01:32.000
So the money isn't a consideration.

01:32.000 --> 01:36.000
A lot of creationists would probably answer yes to the same question.

01:36.000 --> 01:42.000
So Lorenzo and Adrian come across as intelligent, rational, and sympathetic to a victim's plight.

01:42.000 --> 01:45.000
That'll never do for a creationist video.

01:45.000 --> 01:47.000
Ray, these guys are supposed to be evil.

01:47.000 --> 01:51.000
Quick, get this video down to the editing room and lay a different voice track over the top.

01:51.000 --> 01:53.000
I've got another dilemma for you.

01:53.000 --> 01:57.000
This lady wants to get rid of her husband. She says he's a rat.

01:57.000 --> 02:02.000
All you have to do is drop one tablet of arsenic into his coffee when he's not looking.

02:02.000 --> 02:07.000
You will get away with it, you'll not get caught, and she will give you ten million dollars cash.

02:07.000 --> 02:08.000
Would you do it?

02:08.000 --> 02:10.000
So now the question is different.

02:10.000 --> 02:15.000
The potential murder victim is no longer a nasty dude beating up his wife.

02:15.000 --> 02:17.000
Now he's just an innocent husband.

02:17.000 --> 02:21.000
His only crime appears to be that his wife thinks he's a rat.

02:21.000 --> 02:24.000
The only incentive to kill him is ten million dollars.

02:24.000 --> 02:26.000
That's better. Would you do it?

02:26.000 --> 02:27.000
Yes.

02:27.000 --> 02:28.000
What about you?

02:28.000 --> 02:29.000
Do it for free.

02:29.000 --> 02:30.000
Don't cut it out.

02:30.000 --> 02:36.000
So while they give the same answer as before, Ray's simply changed the question he voiced over the top.

02:36.000 --> 02:42.000
And that transforms them from being decent guys wanting to help a woman being victimised by her husband

02:42.000 --> 02:46.000
into two monsters who are quite willing to murder an innocent man.

02:46.000 --> 02:49.000
We've seen this kind of editing before in creationist videos.

02:49.000 --> 02:55.000
Answers are cut, chopped up and hidden inside cutaways so the interviewee ends up appearing to say something

02:55.000 --> 02:58.000
contrary to what he actually said.

02:58.000 --> 03:02.000
Sometimes the question cuts directly to the answer of a completely different question

03:02.000 --> 03:07.000
or, as Comfort has done, a new question is voiced over the original one.

03:07.000 --> 03:12.000
Of course it's dishonest but Comfort makes a career out of saying we're all sinners

03:12.000 --> 03:18.000
so if he can portray people as willing to murder someone for money then that vindicates and confirms what he's preaching.

03:18.000 --> 03:26.000
And Comfort also preaches that we're all liars but apparently it's okay to lie as long as you've been saved by Jesus.

03:26.000 --> 03:31.000
I'm afraid Comfort can't be nominated for a golden crocoduck for this piece of fakery

03:31.000 --> 03:37.000
because he's already won the award back in 2009 but an eagle-eyed subscriber to my channel

03:37.000 --> 03:42.000
spotted it and suggested that Comfort's subterfuge needed to be more widely appreciated

03:42.000 --> 03:44.000
and I'm happy to oblige.
