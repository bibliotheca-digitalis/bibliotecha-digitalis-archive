0	3000	A very rich lady wants to get rid of her husband.
3000	7000	He's a rat. He beats her up. He's just a nasty dude.
7000	10000	She wants to get rid of him. She's going to pay you ten million dollars.
10000	13000	All you have to do, when she takes him out of her room,
13000	18000	is step through a door where you've been hiding, drop an arsenic pill into his coffee,
18000	21000	and you get ten million dollars.
21000	24000	Would you do it? And you will not get caught, once again, for sure.
24000	25000	Yes.
25000	26000	What about you?
26000	27000	Do it for free.
27000	28000	Don't cut it out.
28000	29000	No, I would.
29000	31000	You'd kill a guy if he was a rat?
31000	34000	Yeah, if he was evil enough and he did the bad things.
34000	36000	Just take him out.
36000	39000	Remind me never to upset you.
39000	41000	And he's your friend?
41000	42000	Yes, yes.
42000	43000	Be nice to him, okay?
43000	46000	So, um, would you do it for ten million dollars?
46000	47000	Yes.
47000	50000	So you would become a murderer for ten million dollars?
50000	55000	The guy asking the questions here is Ray Comfort, better known as Banana Man.
55000	58000	He's posing an interesting ethical question.
58000	64000	If a nasty dude is beating up his wife, would you kill him if all you had to do was put poison in his drink
64000	66000	and you were guaranteed not to get caught?
66000	71000	There are all sorts of reasons why people might say yes to this question.
71000	75000	Perhaps they imagine the woman is in danger of being killed or maimed.
75000	79000	A lot of women do kill abusive husbands in fear of their lives,
79000	82000	and the courts often deal with them very leniently.
82000	85000	Comfort throws in a sweetener of ten million dollars.
85000	89000	But as the guy on the left, Lorenzo, says, he'd do it for free.
89000	92000	So the money isn't a consideration.
92000	96000	A lot of creationists would probably answer yes to the same question.
96000	102000	So Lorenzo and Adrian come across as intelligent, rational, and sympathetic to a victim's plight.
102000	105000	That'll never do for a creationist video.
105000	107000	Ray, these guys are supposed to be evil.
107000	111000	Quick, get this video down to the editing room and lay a different voice track over the top.
111000	113000	I've got another dilemma for you.
113000	117000	This lady wants to get rid of her husband. She says he's a rat.
117000	122000	All you have to do is drop one tablet of arsenic into his coffee when he's not looking.
122000	127000	You will get away with it, you'll not get caught, and she will give you ten million dollars cash.
127000	128000	Would you do it?
128000	130000	So now the question is different.
130000	135000	The potential murder victim is no longer a nasty dude beating up his wife.
135000	137000	Now he's just an innocent husband.
137000	141000	His only crime appears to be that his wife thinks he's a rat.
141000	144000	The only incentive to kill him is ten million dollars.
144000	146000	That's better. Would you do it?
146000	147000	Yes.
147000	148000	What about you?
148000	149000	Do it for free.
149000	150000	Don't cut it out.
150000	156000	So while they give the same answer as before, Ray's simply changed the question he voiced over the top.
156000	162000	And that transforms them from being decent guys wanting to help a woman being victimised by her husband
162000	166000	into two monsters who are quite willing to murder an innocent man.
166000	169000	We've seen this kind of editing before in creationist videos.
169000	175000	Answers are cut, chopped up and hidden inside cutaways so the interviewee ends up appearing to say something
175000	178000	contrary to what he actually said.
178000	182000	Sometimes the question cuts directly to the answer of a completely different question
182000	187000	or, as Comfort has done, a new question is voiced over the original one.
187000	192000	Of course it's dishonest but Comfort makes a career out of saying we're all sinners
192000	198000	so if he can portray people as willing to murder someone for money then that vindicates and confirms what he's preaching.
198000	206000	And Comfort also preaches that we're all liars but apparently it's okay to lie as long as you've been saved by Jesus.
206000	211000	I'm afraid Comfort can't be nominated for a golden crocoduck for this piece of fakery
211000	217000	because he's already won the award back in 2009 but an eagle-eyed subscriber to my channel
217000	222000	spotted it and suggested that Comfort's subterfuge needed to be more widely appreciated
222000	224000	and I'm happy to oblige.
