1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
A very rich lady wants to get rid of her husband.

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:07,000
He's a rat. He beats her up. He's just a nasty dude.

3
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:10,000
She wants to get rid of him. She's going to pay you ten million dollars.

4
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:13,000
All you have to do, when she takes him out of her room,

5
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:18,000
is step through a door where you've been hiding, drop an arsenic pill into his coffee,

6
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:21,000
and you get ten million dollars.

7
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:24,000
Would you do it? And you will not get caught, once again, for sure.

8
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:25,000
Yes.

9
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:26,000
What about you?

10
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:27,000
Do it for free.

11
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:28,000
Don't cut it out.

12
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:29,000
No, I would.

13
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:31,000
You'd kill a guy if he was a rat?

14
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:34,000
Yeah, if he was evil enough and he did the bad things.

15
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:36,000
Just take him out.

16
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:39,000
Remind me never to upset you.

17
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:41,000
And he's your friend?

18
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:42,000
Yes, yes.

19
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:43,000
Be nice to him, okay?

20
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:46,000
So, um, would you do it for ten million dollars?

21
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:47,000
Yes.

22
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:50,000
So you would become a murderer for ten million dollars?

23
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:55,000
The guy asking the questions here is Ray Comfort, better known as Banana Man.

24
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:58,000
He's posing an interesting ethical question.

25
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:04,000
If a nasty dude is beating up his wife, would you kill him if all you had to do was put poison in his drink

26
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,000
and you were guaranteed not to get caught?

27
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:11,000
There are all sorts of reasons why people might say yes to this question.

28
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:15,000
Perhaps they imagine the woman is in danger of being killed or maimed.

29
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:19,000
A lot of women do kill abusive husbands in fear of their lives,

30
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:22,000
and the courts often deal with them very leniently.

31
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:25,000
Comfort throws in a sweetener of ten million dollars.

32
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:29,000
But as the guy on the left, Lorenzo, says, he'd do it for free.

33
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:32,000
So the money isn't a consideration.

34
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:36,000
A lot of creationists would probably answer yes to the same question.

35
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:42,000
So Lorenzo and Adrian come across as intelligent, rational, and sympathetic to a victim's plight.

36
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:45,000
That'll never do for a creationist video.

37
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:47,000
Ray, these guys are supposed to be evil.

38
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:51,000
Quick, get this video down to the editing room and lay a different voice track over the top.

39
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:53,000
I've got another dilemma for you.

40
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:57,000
This lady wants to get rid of her husband. She says he's a rat.

41
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:02,000
All you have to do is drop one tablet of arsenic into his coffee when he's not looking.

42
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:07,000
You will get away with it, you'll not get caught, and she will give you ten million dollars cash.

43
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:08,000
Would you do it?

44
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,000
So now the question is different.

45
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:15,000
The potential murder victim is no longer a nasty dude beating up his wife.

46
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:17,000
Now he's just an innocent husband.

47
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:21,000
His only crime appears to be that his wife thinks he's a rat.

48
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:24,000
The only incentive to kill him is ten million dollars.

49
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,000
That's better. Would you do it?

50
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:27,000
Yes.

51
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:28,000
What about you?

52
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:29,000
Do it for free.

53
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:30,000
Don't cut it out.

54
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:36,000
So while they give the same answer as before, Ray's simply changed the question he voiced over the top.

55
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:42,000
And that transforms them from being decent guys wanting to help a woman being victimised by her husband

56
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:46,000
into two monsters who are quite willing to murder an innocent man.

57
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:49,000
We've seen this kind of editing before in creationist videos.

58
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:55,000
Answers are cut, chopped up and hidden inside cutaways so the interviewee ends up appearing to say something

59
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:58,000
contrary to what he actually said.

60
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:02,000
Sometimes the question cuts directly to the answer of a completely different question

61
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:07,000
or, as Comfort has done, a new question is voiced over the original one.

62
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:12,000
Of course it's dishonest but Comfort makes a career out of saying we're all sinners

63
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:18,000
so if he can portray people as willing to murder someone for money then that vindicates and confirms what he's preaching.

64
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:26,000
And Comfort also preaches that we're all liars but apparently it's okay to lie as long as you've been saved by Jesus.

65
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:31,000
I'm afraid Comfort can't be nominated for a golden crocoduck for this piece of fakery

66
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:37,000
because he's already won the award back in 2009 but an eagle-eyed subscriber to my channel

67
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:42,000
spotted it and suggested that Comfort's subterfuge needed to be more widely appreciated

68
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,000
and I'm happy to oblige.
