00:00.000 --> 00:07.320
Ladies and gentlemen, I have a grave prediction to bring to your attention.

00:07.320 --> 00:14.720
New York is going to be destroyed on February 9th, 2009.

00:14.720 --> 00:17.520
Whoops, sorry, wrong prediction.

00:17.520 --> 00:19.480
Hang on, let me get the right clip here.

00:19.480 --> 00:21.880
Okay, what was the prediction again?

00:21.880 --> 00:28.080
Judgment Day is May 21, 2011, and that's going to happen.

00:28.080 --> 00:29.840
Oh, that's right.

00:29.840 --> 00:32.600
Judgment Day is May 21st, 2011.

00:32.600 --> 00:37.600
Well, all I can say is that it's coming up to midnight on May 20th here in Australia,

00:37.600 --> 00:39.720
and I'm not seeing any sign of judge-

00:39.720 --> 00:44.960
Sorry, I hit the power cable.

00:44.960 --> 00:48.000
As I was saying, I'm not seeing any sign of Judgment Day.

00:48.000 --> 00:52.620
I was alerted to this May 21st prophecy when I did my last video on the supposed increase

00:52.620 --> 00:55.880
in natural disasters, so thanks to all those who wrote in.

00:55.880 --> 00:59.000
Now, what exactly is the prediction?

00:59.000 --> 01:04.600
We have a number of prophecies that all seem to imply that something is going to happen

01:04.600 --> 01:06.000
in the 21st century.

01:06.000 --> 01:09.560
Oh, come on, seems to imply something will happen this century.

01:09.560 --> 01:13.520
Look, if you want to set yourself up as a prophetic guru, you have to be a little more

01:13.520 --> 01:14.920
specific than that.

01:14.920 --> 01:20.440
Let's have some dates, preferably from someone with serious glasses, a serious suit, sitting

01:20.440 --> 01:22.800
in front of some serious oriental prince.

01:22.800 --> 01:32.960
This is more than likely referring to October 21st, 2011, but it begins five months earlier

01:32.960 --> 01:39.080
on May 21st, 2011, and it leads up to the final destruction of the universe.

01:39.080 --> 01:42.200
The lady and gentleman would like to order drinks before dinner.

01:42.200 --> 01:43.600
Yeah, great.

01:43.600 --> 01:47.280
And the universe will explode later, for your pleasure.

01:47.280 --> 01:54.480
We travel to as many states as possible to proclaim the fact that May 21st, 2011 is the

01:54.480 --> 01:57.100
day of the Lord's return.

01:57.100 --> 02:04.360
When we caravan, we see people that give us the thumb, they say thumbs up.

02:04.360 --> 02:10.520
We also see people that unfortunately give us the other, the other finger.

02:10.520 --> 02:17.240
History shows a surprisingly good track record for those who say Doomsday is almost here.

02:17.240 --> 02:21.560
History shows a good track record for those who say Doomsday is almost here.

02:21.560 --> 02:24.120
How many Doomsdays have we experienced?

02:24.120 --> 02:27.080
Actually the track record is pretty piss poor.

02:27.080 --> 02:31.240
People have been predicting Judgment Day ever since Jesus told his disciples he had returned

02:31.240 --> 02:33.400
before a generation had passed.

02:33.400 --> 02:38.340
Ever since then, every generation has thought itself special, and that it would be the one

02:38.340 --> 02:39.720
to witness the second coming.

02:39.720 --> 02:45.720
It will be as twer' a mighty rending in the sky, and the mountains shall sink and the

02:45.720 --> 02:51.720
valleys shall rise, and great shall be the tumult thereof, I should think.

02:51.720 --> 02:55.720
Will the veil of the temple be renting twain?

02:55.720 --> 03:01.720
Well, the veil of the temple is always rather dodgy, but should be renting twain about two

03:01.720 --> 03:05.720
minutes before we see the sign of the flying manifest dancing on the firmament.

03:05.720 --> 03:09.720
William Miller, founder of the Adventist movement, said Jesus would return between

03:09.720 --> 03:14.720
March 21st 1843 and March 21st 1844.

03:14.720 --> 03:20.720
When that didn't happen, his colleague Samuel Snow amended the date to October 22nd 1844.

03:20.720 --> 03:22.720
That didn't happen either.

03:22.720 --> 03:28.720
A book by Nelson Barbour was called Evidences for the Coming of the Lord in 1873.

03:28.720 --> 03:31.720
Cells of the book dropped in 1874.

03:32.720 --> 03:36.720
Joseph Smith, founder of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, claimed Jesus

03:36.720 --> 03:39.720
would return by 1891.

03:39.720 --> 03:43.720
And Herbert Armstrong, founder of the Worldwide Church of God, wrote a book predicting the

03:43.720 --> 03:46.720
return of Jesus by 1975.

03:46.720 --> 03:48.720
A good track record?

03:48.720 --> 03:49.720
Really?

03:49.720 --> 03:52.720
And I don't even have time for all the other predictions of the end of the world that fell

03:52.720 --> 03:54.720
by the wayside of history.

03:54.720 --> 03:59.720
But the May 21st predictions are particularly enjoyable because of the absolute certainty

03:59.720 --> 04:00.720
of its adherence.

04:01.720 --> 04:04.720
We don't say at all that it has a high likelihood.

04:04.720 --> 04:10.720
We say, we must say, we are commanded to say, it's going to happen.

04:10.720 --> 04:15.720
And that's what's going to make it so much fun when we all wake up on May 22nd and watch

04:15.720 --> 04:17.720
the backsliding begin.

04:17.720 --> 04:20.720
So here's my prediction for May 22nd.

04:20.720 --> 04:22.720
One of the following things will occur.

04:22.720 --> 04:26.720
Either the May 21st prophets will say they made a mistake in their math and give us a

04:26.720 --> 04:28.720
new date for the end of the world.

04:28.720 --> 04:32.720
Or something will happen somewhere in the world, it always does, and they'll latch onto

04:32.720 --> 04:35.720
that as a sign that their prophecy came true.

04:35.720 --> 04:38.720
It could be a typhoon in the Philippines or a bombing in Afghanistan.

04:38.720 --> 04:42.720
It could even be the claim that someone saw Jesus.

04:42.720 --> 04:47.720
Or they'll say that Jesus has slipped in unobtrusively and no one will notice until the final conflagration

04:47.720 --> 04:49.720
in October.

04:49.720 --> 04:53.720
Or lastly, the prophets will simply crawl under a rock and refuse to be interviewed.

04:54.720 --> 04:58.720
One thing that I confidently predict won't happen is that the return of Jesus will be

04:58.720 --> 05:00.720
the main story in the evening news.

05:00.720 --> 05:02.720
Have a happy 21st.

05:23.720 --> 05:28.720
Now is the end.

05:28.720 --> 05:33.720
Perish the road.

05:39.720 --> 05:41.720
It was GMT, wasn't it?

05:43.720 --> 05:49.720
Well, it's not quite the conflagration we've been banking on.

05:50.720 --> 05:52.720
Never mind, lads.

05:52.720 --> 05:57.720
Same time tomorrow. We must get a winner one day.
