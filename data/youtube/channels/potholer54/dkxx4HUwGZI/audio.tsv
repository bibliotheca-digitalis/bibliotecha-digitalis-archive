0	7320	Ladies and gentlemen, I have a grave prediction to bring to your attention.
7320	14720	New York is going to be destroyed on February 9th, 2009.
14720	17520	Whoops, sorry, wrong prediction.
17520	19480	Hang on, let me get the right clip here.
19480	21880	Okay, what was the prediction again?
21880	28080	Judgment Day is May 21, 2011, and that's going to happen.
28080	29840	Oh, that's right.
29840	32600	Judgment Day is May 21st, 2011.
32600	37600	Well, all I can say is that it's coming up to midnight on May 20th here in Australia,
37600	39720	and I'm not seeing any sign of judge-
39720	44960	Sorry, I hit the power cable.
44960	48000	As I was saying, I'm not seeing any sign of Judgment Day.
48000	52620	I was alerted to this May 21st prophecy when I did my last video on the supposed increase
52620	55880	in natural disasters, so thanks to all those who wrote in.
55880	59000	Now, what exactly is the prediction?
59000	64600	We have a number of prophecies that all seem to imply that something is going to happen
64600	66000	in the 21st century.
66000	69560	Oh, come on, seems to imply something will happen this century.
69560	73520	Look, if you want to set yourself up as a prophetic guru, you have to be a little more
73520	74920	specific than that.
74920	80440	Let's have some dates, preferably from someone with serious glasses, a serious suit, sitting
80440	82800	in front of some serious oriental prince.
82800	92960	This is more than likely referring to October 21st, 2011, but it begins five months earlier
92960	99080	on May 21st, 2011, and it leads up to the final destruction of the universe.
99080	102200	The lady and gentleman would like to order drinks before dinner.
102200	103600	Yeah, great.
103600	107280	And the universe will explode later, for your pleasure.
107280	114480	We travel to as many states as possible to proclaim the fact that May 21st, 2011 is the
114480	117100	day of the Lord's return.
117100	124360	When we caravan, we see people that give us the thumb, they say thumbs up.
124360	130520	We also see people that unfortunately give us the other, the other finger.
130520	137240	History shows a surprisingly good track record for those who say Doomsday is almost here.
137240	141560	History shows a good track record for those who say Doomsday is almost here.
141560	144120	How many Doomsdays have we experienced?
144120	147080	Actually the track record is pretty piss poor.
147080	151240	People have been predicting Judgment Day ever since Jesus told his disciples he had returned
151240	153400	before a generation had passed.
153400	158340	Ever since then, every generation has thought itself special, and that it would be the one
158340	159720	to witness the second coming.
159720	165720	It will be as twer' a mighty rending in the sky, and the mountains shall sink and the
165720	171720	valleys shall rise, and great shall be the tumult thereof, I should think.
171720	175720	Will the veil of the temple be renting twain?
175720	181720	Well, the veil of the temple is always rather dodgy, but should be renting twain about two
181720	185720	minutes before we see the sign of the flying manifest dancing on the firmament.
185720	189720	William Miller, founder of the Adventist movement, said Jesus would return between
189720	194720	March 21st 1843 and March 21st 1844.
194720	200720	When that didn't happen, his colleague Samuel Snow amended the date to October 22nd 1844.
200720	202720	That didn't happen either.
202720	208720	A book by Nelson Barbour was called Evidences for the Coming of the Lord in 1873.
208720	211720	Cells of the book dropped in 1874.
212720	216720	Joseph Smith, founder of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, claimed Jesus
216720	219720	would return by 1891.
219720	223720	And Herbert Armstrong, founder of the Worldwide Church of God, wrote a book predicting the
223720	226720	return of Jesus by 1975.
226720	228720	A good track record?
228720	229720	Really?
229720	232720	And I don't even have time for all the other predictions of the end of the world that fell
232720	234720	by the wayside of history.
234720	239720	But the May 21st predictions are particularly enjoyable because of the absolute certainty
239720	240720	of its adherence.
241720	244720	We don't say at all that it has a high likelihood.
244720	250720	We say, we must say, we are commanded to say, it's going to happen.
250720	255720	And that's what's going to make it so much fun when we all wake up on May 22nd and watch
255720	257720	the backsliding begin.
257720	260720	So here's my prediction for May 22nd.
260720	262720	One of the following things will occur.
262720	266720	Either the May 21st prophets will say they made a mistake in their math and give us a
266720	268720	new date for the end of the world.
268720	272720	Or something will happen somewhere in the world, it always does, and they'll latch onto
272720	275720	that as a sign that their prophecy came true.
275720	278720	It could be a typhoon in the Philippines or a bombing in Afghanistan.
278720	282720	It could even be the claim that someone saw Jesus.
282720	287720	Or they'll say that Jesus has slipped in unobtrusively and no one will notice until the final conflagration
287720	289720	in October.
289720	293720	Or lastly, the prophets will simply crawl under a rock and refuse to be interviewed.
294720	298720	One thing that I confidently predict won't happen is that the return of Jesus will be
298720	300720	the main story in the evening news.
300720	302720	Have a happy 21st.
323720	328720	Now is the end.
328720	333720	Perish the road.
339720	341720	It was GMT, wasn't it?
343720	349720	Well, it's not quite the conflagration we've been banking on.
350720	352720	Never mind, lads.
352720	357720	Same time tomorrow. We must get a winner one day.
