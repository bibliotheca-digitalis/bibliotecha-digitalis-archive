1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,320
Ladies and gentlemen, I have a grave prediction to bring to your attention.

2
00:00:07,320 --> 00:00:14,720
New York is going to be destroyed on February 9th, 2009.

3
00:00:14,720 --> 00:00:17,520
Whoops, sorry, wrong prediction.

4
00:00:17,520 --> 00:00:19,480
Hang on, let me get the right clip here.

5
00:00:19,480 --> 00:00:21,880
Okay, what was the prediction again?

6
00:00:21,880 --> 00:00:28,080
Judgment Day is May 21, 2011, and that's going to happen.

7
00:00:28,080 --> 00:00:29,840
Oh, that's right.

8
00:00:29,840 --> 00:00:32,600
Judgment Day is May 21st, 2011.

9
00:00:32,600 --> 00:00:37,600
Well, all I can say is that it's coming up to midnight on May 20th here in Australia,

10
00:00:37,600 --> 00:00:39,720
and I'm not seeing any sign of judge-

11
00:00:39,720 --> 00:00:44,960
Sorry, I hit the power cable.

12
00:00:44,960 --> 00:00:48,000
As I was saying, I'm not seeing any sign of Judgment Day.

13
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:52,620
I was alerted to this May 21st prophecy when I did my last video on the supposed increase

14
00:00:52,620 --> 00:00:55,880
in natural disasters, so thanks to all those who wrote in.

15
00:00:55,880 --> 00:00:59,000
Now, what exactly is the prediction?

16
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:04,600
We have a number of prophecies that all seem to imply that something is going to happen

17
00:01:04,600 --> 00:01:06,000
in the 21st century.

18
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:09,560
Oh, come on, seems to imply something will happen this century.

19
00:01:09,560 --> 00:01:13,520
Look, if you want to set yourself up as a prophetic guru, you have to be a little more

20
00:01:13,520 --> 00:01:14,920
specific than that.

21
00:01:14,920 --> 00:01:20,440
Let's have some dates, preferably from someone with serious glasses, a serious suit, sitting

22
00:01:20,440 --> 00:01:22,800
in front of some serious oriental prince.

23
00:01:22,800 --> 00:01:32,960
This is more than likely referring to October 21st, 2011, but it begins five months earlier

24
00:01:32,960 --> 00:01:39,080
on May 21st, 2011, and it leads up to the final destruction of the universe.

25
00:01:39,080 --> 00:01:42,200
The lady and gentleman would like to order drinks before dinner.

26
00:01:42,200 --> 00:01:43,600
Yeah, great.

27
00:01:43,600 --> 00:01:47,280
And the universe will explode later, for your pleasure.

28
00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:54,480
We travel to as many states as possible to proclaim the fact that May 21st, 2011 is the

29
00:01:54,480 --> 00:01:57,100
day of the Lord's return.

30
00:01:57,100 --> 00:02:04,360
When we caravan, we see people that give us the thumb, they say thumbs up.

31
00:02:04,360 --> 00:02:10,520
We also see people that unfortunately give us the other, the other finger.

32
00:02:10,520 --> 00:02:17,240
History shows a surprisingly good track record for those who say Doomsday is almost here.

33
00:02:17,240 --> 00:02:21,560
History shows a good track record for those who say Doomsday is almost here.

34
00:02:21,560 --> 00:02:24,120
How many Doomsdays have we experienced?

35
00:02:24,120 --> 00:02:27,080
Actually the track record is pretty piss poor.

36
00:02:27,080 --> 00:02:31,240
People have been predicting Judgment Day ever since Jesus told his disciples he had returned

37
00:02:31,240 --> 00:02:33,400
before a generation had passed.

38
00:02:33,400 --> 00:02:38,340
Ever since then, every generation has thought itself special, and that it would be the one

39
00:02:38,340 --> 00:02:39,720
to witness the second coming.

40
00:02:39,720 --> 00:02:45,720
It will be as twer' a mighty rending in the sky, and the mountains shall sink and the

41
00:02:45,720 --> 00:02:51,720
valleys shall rise, and great shall be the tumult thereof, I should think.

42
00:02:51,720 --> 00:02:55,720
Will the veil of the temple be renting twain?

43
00:02:55,720 --> 00:03:01,720
Well, the veil of the temple is always rather dodgy, but should be renting twain about two

44
00:03:01,720 --> 00:03:05,720
minutes before we see the sign of the flying manifest dancing on the firmament.

45
00:03:05,720 --> 00:03:09,720
William Miller, founder of the Adventist movement, said Jesus would return between

46
00:03:09,720 --> 00:03:14,720
March 21st 1843 and March 21st 1844.

47
00:03:14,720 --> 00:03:20,720
When that didn't happen, his colleague Samuel Snow amended the date to October 22nd 1844.

48
00:03:20,720 --> 00:03:22,720
That didn't happen either.

49
00:03:22,720 --> 00:03:28,720
A book by Nelson Barbour was called Evidences for the Coming of the Lord in 1873.

50
00:03:28,720 --> 00:03:31,720
Cells of the book dropped in 1874.

51
00:03:32,720 --> 00:03:36,720
Joseph Smith, founder of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, claimed Jesus

52
00:03:36,720 --> 00:03:39,720
would return by 1891.

53
00:03:39,720 --> 00:03:43,720
And Herbert Armstrong, founder of the Worldwide Church of God, wrote a book predicting the

54
00:03:43,720 --> 00:03:46,720
return of Jesus by 1975.

55
00:03:46,720 --> 00:03:48,720
A good track record?

56
00:03:48,720 --> 00:03:49,720
Really?

57
00:03:49,720 --> 00:03:52,720
And I don't even have time for all the other predictions of the end of the world that fell

58
00:03:52,720 --> 00:03:54,720
by the wayside of history.

59
00:03:54,720 --> 00:03:59,720
But the May 21st predictions are particularly enjoyable because of the absolute certainty

60
00:03:59,720 --> 00:04:00,720
of its adherence.

61
00:04:01,720 --> 00:04:04,720
We don't say at all that it has a high likelihood.

62
00:04:04,720 --> 00:04:10,720
We say, we must say, we are commanded to say, it's going to happen.

63
00:04:10,720 --> 00:04:15,720
And that's what's going to make it so much fun when we all wake up on May 22nd and watch

64
00:04:15,720 --> 00:04:17,720
the backsliding begin.

65
00:04:17,720 --> 00:04:20,720
So here's my prediction for May 22nd.

66
00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:22,720
One of the following things will occur.

67
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:26,720
Either the May 21st prophets will say they made a mistake in their math and give us a

68
00:04:26,720 --> 00:04:28,720
new date for the end of the world.

69
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:32,720
Or something will happen somewhere in the world, it always does, and they'll latch onto

70
00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:35,720
that as a sign that their prophecy came true.

71
00:04:35,720 --> 00:04:38,720
It could be a typhoon in the Philippines or a bombing in Afghanistan.

72
00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:42,720
It could even be the claim that someone saw Jesus.

73
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:47,720
Or they'll say that Jesus has slipped in unobtrusively and no one will notice until the final conflagration

74
00:04:47,720 --> 00:04:49,720
in October.

75
00:04:49,720 --> 00:04:53,720
Or lastly, the prophets will simply crawl under a rock and refuse to be interviewed.

76
00:04:54,720 --> 00:04:58,720
One thing that I confidently predict won't happen is that the return of Jesus will be

77
00:04:58,720 --> 00:05:00,720
the main story in the evening news.

78
00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:02,720
Have a happy 21st.

79
00:05:23,720 --> 00:05:28,720
Now is the end.

80
00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:33,720
Perish the road.

81
00:05:39,720 --> 00:05:41,720
It was GMT, wasn't it?

82
00:05:43,720 --> 00:05:49,720
Well, it's not quite the conflagration we've been banking on.

83
00:05:50,720 --> 00:05:52,720
Never mind, lads.

84
00:05:52,720 --> 00:05:57,720
Same time tomorrow. We must get a winner one day.
