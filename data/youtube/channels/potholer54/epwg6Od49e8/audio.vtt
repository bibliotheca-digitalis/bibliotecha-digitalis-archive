00:00.000 --> 00:07.440
They know but are not telling you that the upper tectonic plates of Earth also join in the Pacific.

00:07.440 --> 00:12.240
I thought I'd take a break from conspiracies to promote evolution and conspiracies to fake

00:12.240 --> 00:17.280
climate change to tackle another conspiracy of evil scientists to hide from us the fact

00:17.280 --> 00:23.120
that our Earth is expanding. Once again, this isn't just a hypothesis according to its adherence,

00:23.120 --> 00:28.560
it's the irrefutable truth. The idea that the Earth has been expanding dates back to the 19th

00:28.560 --> 00:34.800
century as a way of explaining another scientific hypothesis, continental drift. But with the advent

00:34.800 --> 00:40.080
of plate tectonics, the expanding Earth idea has gone the same way as the flat Earth and the Earth

00:40.080 --> 00:45.520
centred universe. In other words, some people still believe it. And now that we live in the

00:45.520 --> 00:50.560
age of the internet, where wacky ideas can be spread by anyone with a pulse and a keyboard,

00:50.560 --> 00:53.840
the expanding Earth idea has been revived. My name is Joe.

00:54.720 --> 01:02.880
Okay, not yet, Joe. Apart from Joe, a creationist who thinks the expanding Earth explains the

01:02.880 --> 01:08.960
biblical flood, there's also a living geologist attached to the idea, James Maxlow. But nearly

01:08.960 --> 01:13.360
all the messages I got alerting me to the expanding Earth flammory referred to this

01:13.360 --> 01:19.440
video by comic book artist Neil Adams. It shows very slickly just how well all the continents

01:19.440 --> 01:24.640
fit together as we reduce the size of the Earth. No twisting, no form-fitting. Well,

01:24.640 --> 01:29.600
let's be honest, quite a few places do have to be squashed to make them fit, like Alaska.

01:33.040 --> 01:37.760
No altering shapes or sizes. Not quite true either. Adams has taken the shapes of the

01:37.760 --> 01:43.040
continents as they appear in an atlas. But these are just the parts of the continental crust that

01:43.040 --> 01:48.080
are above sea level. In fact, the continents are bigger and their shapes are different because the

01:48.080 --> 01:53.840
true edges are the continental shelves. But never mind that Adams got the shape and the size of the

01:53.840 --> 01:58.640
continents wrong and had to squash them to make them fit. That's not what really debunks the

01:58.640 --> 02:03.840
notion of an expanding Earth. Two years ago, when someone first messaged me about the video,

02:03.840 --> 02:08.960
I wrote to Neil Adams with a simple question. If the Earth has been gaining all this mass,

02:08.960 --> 02:15.200
where does the extra mass come from? The answer I got referred to superheated denseness, like a

02:15.200 --> 02:22.080
giant electromagnetic engine creating energy like a small confined sun. And no, I couldn't make head

02:22.080 --> 02:28.080
or tail of it either. It certainly didn't explain where the extra mass came from. So let's try James

02:28.080 --> 02:33.680
Maxlow, the geologist who's been advocating the expanding Earth theory for over 30 years. If anyone

02:33.680 --> 02:39.840
can explain where the extra mass came from, he can. So where did all this mass come from? I don't know.

02:39.840 --> 02:47.680
Oh. So if Maxlow, the geologist, doesn't know, I suppose we've got no choice but to have another

02:47.680 --> 02:56.560
stab at Neil Adams. I asked again about... Not now, Joe. I asked again about where the extra mass came

02:56.560 --> 03:03.120
from. Eventually, I got this. Pretend we have pipes going to the core and as you convert hydrogen to

03:03.120 --> 03:08.640
helium and release more energy, we pump more prime matter down the pipes. For that new energy to

03:08.640 --> 03:15.760
impact in new pair production cooling it down. Now we make more helium and pump in more prime matter.

03:15.760 --> 03:23.360
That's how it works. Prime matter has infacing fields and can flow anywhere. What this tells us

03:23.360 --> 03:28.960
is that Adams thinks nuclear fusion, which takes place in the centre of stars, is taking place in

03:28.960 --> 03:34.560
the centre of the Earth. Pair production is real enough when energy condenses into a positron and

03:34.560 --> 03:40.160
electron, but these particles are short-lived. They aren't atoms and they turn back into energy

03:40.160 --> 03:46.000
in a fraction of a second. And what's prime matter? Well, Adams says it's some sort of potential

03:46.000 --> 03:52.320
matter floating around in space and you can't see, touch or detect it. It was first theorized by...

03:52.320 --> 03:58.560
No, not Einstein. No, not Hawking either. It was first theorized by an ancient Greek philosopher,

03:58.640 --> 04:03.440
Aristotle. I tried to understand what this imagined substance might be.

04:04.080 --> 04:07.760
Adams grew increasingly frustrated as he tried to explain it to me.

04:08.640 --> 04:14.880
Imagine nothing. A force pulls outward on it, spin to make it less than nothing. You get undetectable

04:14.880 --> 04:20.480
bubbles distributing the pressure. The bubble is an electron. At its centre is a point particle we

04:20.480 --> 04:26.800
call a positron. Actually we call it a positron too, Neil, if I'm thinking of the same positron that you

04:26.800 --> 04:34.320
are. If you pop the point positron out with a high energy photon you will get matter. So if you put

04:34.320 --> 04:38.560
the whole thing together it's bubbles of nothing going down pretend pipes into a mini sun at the

04:38.560 --> 04:43.680
centre of the Earth. I'm probably not explaining it any better than Adams is, but then I don't have

04:43.680 --> 04:48.400
a clue as to what he's on about. This is new age hippie speak, not the language of science.

04:49.040 --> 04:54.080
Adams assured me that the reason I don't understand it is because I've been brainwashed by science

04:54.080 --> 04:59.120
and I'm just not thinking. Different materials. Let's go back to Maxlow who says he doesn't know

04:59.120 --> 05:04.720
how new matter forms either, but of course that doesn't stop him speculating. Whatever the sun

05:04.720 --> 05:13.680
is made of. Whatever the sun is made of? It's made of hydrogen and helium. Oh whatever. This blob of

05:13.680 --> 05:19.760
pure energy, whatever, plasma, whatever. The sun isn't a blob of pure energy, it's a concentration

05:19.760 --> 05:24.080
of hydrogen that's fusing into helium and releasing energy in the form of heat, light,

05:24.080 --> 05:30.080
and radiation. A similar blob of energy, Maxlow speculates, is found at the centre of the Earth

05:30.080 --> 05:36.480
and the new energy is converted into matter. Only one problem. When fusion takes place,

05:36.480 --> 05:41.680
because that's what we're talking about, matter is converted into energy. So if you then convert

05:41.680 --> 05:47.360
that energy back into matter, there's no net gain of mass. It's rather like having an electric car

05:47.360 --> 05:52.960
with a generator that charges the battery and using the battery to run the car. You just can't

05:52.960 --> 05:58.400
do it. Leaving aside the question of whether we actually have nuclear fusion happening at the

05:58.400 --> 06:09.200
centre of the Earth. Okay, now, Joe. Oh, dropped my ear up in Asian. Ah never mind, we'll come back

06:09.200 --> 06:14.640
to you. Two years on and I check Neil Adams' website again. He's still sticking by his theory

06:14.640 --> 06:20.560
and still bristling at any criticism of it. But even the imaginary blobs of energy and bubbles

06:20.560 --> 06:25.680
of nothing are not the definitive answer as to why an expanding Earth is absolute nonsense.

06:25.680 --> 06:30.080
The reason we know the Earth isn't expanding is because we can measure it directly.

06:30.640 --> 06:35.280
And there's no sign at all that the Earth is growing or has been growing since these

06:35.280 --> 06:40.080
measurements began. On the other hand, we can measure uplift in mountain ranges by several

06:40.080 --> 06:45.440
millimetres a year and along tectonic fault lines and these are entirely consistent with plate

06:45.440 --> 06:51.360
tectonics. Remember it was when plate tectonics came along that the idea of an expanding Earth

06:51.360 --> 06:56.800
was discarded as a way of explaining the drift of continents. Plate tectonics does that job

06:56.800 --> 07:02.400
admirably and with a mountain of evidence to support it. It shows that as new crust is formed

07:02.400 --> 07:07.200
along mid-ocean ridges, it doesn't keep building up to make the Earth bigger. It moves like a

07:07.200 --> 07:12.160
conveyor belt, eventually subducting under a larger and thicker continent. The magnetic

07:12.160 --> 07:16.800
polarity of the rocks moving away from these mid-ocean ridges shows its alignment to the

07:16.800 --> 07:22.800
magnetic poles at the time it was formed. Through geological time these change as the Earth's poles

07:22.800 --> 07:27.600
flip over. We can measure the drift of the continents so we know exactly which direction

07:27.600 --> 07:33.120
they're moving in and how fast. We can see where they were in the past through fossil vegetation

07:33.120 --> 07:37.760
and how they were oriented because of the polarity of their volcanic rocks. We can see

07:37.760 --> 07:43.040
which continents were joined and how through their shared stratigraphy and paleontology.

07:43.040 --> 07:48.640
That means the order and type of rock and the fossils these rocks carry. We can measure uplift

07:48.640 --> 07:54.080
in places where plates are colliding today. We can even visualise subduction taking place

07:54.080 --> 07:58.880
by plotting the source of earthquakes as the subducting plate jars against the thicker plate.

07:59.840 --> 08:05.120
In other words, continental drift is explained perfectly by the circulation system of oceanic

08:05.120 --> 08:10.320
crust. Adams and Maxlow's hypothesis not only overturns everything we know about...

08:10.320 --> 08:15.920
Not now, Joe! It not only overturns everything we know about seismology, paleontology,

08:15.920 --> 08:22.320
glaciology, stratigraphy and volcanology. It also overturns many of the disciplines within physics

08:22.320 --> 08:28.640
about where matter comes from, what energy is and how elements are formed. The astonishing thing is

08:28.960 --> 08:35.360
that this silly 19th century idea has been dormant for more than half a century. But all it takes is

08:35.360 --> 08:40.800
a slick piece of video graphics and an electronic soapbox to the world and people are willing to

08:40.800 --> 08:54.960
believe it. Oh, I nearly forgot! Now, Joe! Now!
