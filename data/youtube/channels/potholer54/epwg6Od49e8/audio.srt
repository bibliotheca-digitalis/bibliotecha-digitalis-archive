1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,440
They know but are not telling you that the upper tectonic plates of Earth also join in the Pacific.

2
00:00:07,440 --> 00:00:12,240
I thought I'd take a break from conspiracies to promote evolution and conspiracies to fake

3
00:00:12,240 --> 00:00:17,280
climate change to tackle another conspiracy of evil scientists to hide from us the fact

4
00:00:17,280 --> 00:00:23,120
that our Earth is expanding. Once again, this isn't just a hypothesis according to its adherence,

5
00:00:23,120 --> 00:00:28,560
it's the irrefutable truth. The idea that the Earth has been expanding dates back to the 19th

6
00:00:28,560 --> 00:00:34,800
century as a way of explaining another scientific hypothesis, continental drift. But with the advent

7
00:00:34,800 --> 00:00:40,080
of plate tectonics, the expanding Earth idea has gone the same way as the flat Earth and the Earth

8
00:00:40,080 --> 00:00:45,520
centred universe. In other words, some people still believe it. And now that we live in the

9
00:00:45,520 --> 00:00:50,560
age of the internet, where wacky ideas can be spread by anyone with a pulse and a keyboard,

10
00:00:50,560 --> 00:00:53,840
the expanding Earth idea has been revived. My name is Joe.

11
00:00:54,720 --> 00:01:02,880
Okay, not yet, Joe. Apart from Joe, a creationist who thinks the expanding Earth explains the

12
00:01:02,880 --> 00:01:08,960
biblical flood, there's also a living geologist attached to the idea, James Maxlow. But nearly

13
00:01:08,960 --> 00:01:13,360
all the messages I got alerting me to the expanding Earth flammory referred to this

14
00:01:13,360 --> 00:01:19,440
video by comic book artist Neil Adams. It shows very slickly just how well all the continents

15
00:01:19,440 --> 00:01:24,640
fit together as we reduce the size of the Earth. No twisting, no form-fitting. Well,

16
00:01:24,640 --> 00:01:29,600
let's be honest, quite a few places do have to be squashed to make them fit, like Alaska.

17
00:01:33,040 --> 00:01:37,760
No altering shapes or sizes. Not quite true either. Adams has taken the shapes of the

18
00:01:37,760 --> 00:01:43,040
continents as they appear in an atlas. But these are just the parts of the continental crust that

19
00:01:43,040 --> 00:01:48,080
are above sea level. In fact, the continents are bigger and their shapes are different because the

20
00:01:48,080 --> 00:01:53,840
true edges are the continental shelves. But never mind that Adams got the shape and the size of the

21
00:01:53,840 --> 00:01:58,640
continents wrong and had to squash them to make them fit. That's not what really debunks the

22
00:01:58,640 --> 00:02:03,840
notion of an expanding Earth. Two years ago, when someone first messaged me about the video,

23
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:08,960
I wrote to Neil Adams with a simple question. If the Earth has been gaining all this mass,

24
00:02:08,960 --> 00:02:15,200
where does the extra mass come from? The answer I got referred to superheated denseness, like a

25
00:02:15,200 --> 00:02:22,080
giant electromagnetic engine creating energy like a small confined sun. And no, I couldn't make head

26
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:28,080
or tail of it either. It certainly didn't explain where the extra mass came from. So let's try James

27
00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:33,680
Maxlow, the geologist who's been advocating the expanding Earth theory for over 30 years. If anyone

28
00:02:33,680 --> 00:02:39,840
can explain where the extra mass came from, he can. So where did all this mass come from? I don't know.

29
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:47,680
Oh. So if Maxlow, the geologist, doesn't know, I suppose we've got no choice but to have another

30
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:56,560
stab at Neil Adams. I asked again about... Not now, Joe. I asked again about where the extra mass came

31
00:02:56,560 --> 00:03:03,120
from. Eventually, I got this. Pretend we have pipes going to the core and as you convert hydrogen to

32
00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:08,640
helium and release more energy, we pump more prime matter down the pipes. For that new energy to

33
00:03:08,640 --> 00:03:15,760
impact in new pair production cooling it down. Now we make more helium and pump in more prime matter.

34
00:03:15,760 --> 00:03:23,360
That's how it works. Prime matter has infacing fields and can flow anywhere. What this tells us

35
00:03:23,360 --> 00:03:28,960
is that Adams thinks nuclear fusion, which takes place in the centre of stars, is taking place in

36
00:03:28,960 --> 00:03:34,560
the centre of the Earth. Pair production is real enough when energy condenses into a positron and

37
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:40,160
electron, but these particles are short-lived. They aren't atoms and they turn back into energy

38
00:03:40,160 --> 00:03:46,000
in a fraction of a second. And what's prime matter? Well, Adams says it's some sort of potential

39
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:52,320
matter floating around in space and you can't see, touch or detect it. It was first theorized by...

40
00:03:52,320 --> 00:03:58,560
No, not Einstein. No, not Hawking either. It was first theorized by an ancient Greek philosopher,

41
00:03:58,640 --> 00:04:03,440
Aristotle. I tried to understand what this imagined substance might be.

42
00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:07,760
Adams grew increasingly frustrated as he tried to explain it to me.

43
00:04:08,640 --> 00:04:14,880
Imagine nothing. A force pulls outward on it, spin to make it less than nothing. You get undetectable

44
00:04:14,880 --> 00:04:20,480
bubbles distributing the pressure. The bubble is an electron. At its centre is a point particle we

45
00:04:20,480 --> 00:04:26,800
call a positron. Actually we call it a positron too, Neil, if I'm thinking of the same positron that you

46
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:34,320
are. If you pop the point positron out with a high energy photon you will get matter. So if you put

47
00:04:34,320 --> 00:04:38,560
the whole thing together it's bubbles of nothing going down pretend pipes into a mini sun at the

48
00:04:38,560 --> 00:04:43,680
centre of the Earth. I'm probably not explaining it any better than Adams is, but then I don't have

49
00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:48,400
a clue as to what he's on about. This is new age hippie speak, not the language of science.

50
00:04:49,040 --> 00:04:54,080
Adams assured me that the reason I don't understand it is because I've been brainwashed by science

51
00:04:54,080 --> 00:04:59,120
and I'm just not thinking. Different materials. Let's go back to Maxlow who says he doesn't know

52
00:04:59,120 --> 00:05:04,720
how new matter forms either, but of course that doesn't stop him speculating. Whatever the sun

53
00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:13,680
is made of. Whatever the sun is made of? It's made of hydrogen and helium. Oh whatever. This blob of

54
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:19,760
pure energy, whatever, plasma, whatever. The sun isn't a blob of pure energy, it's a concentration

55
00:05:19,760 --> 00:05:24,080
of hydrogen that's fusing into helium and releasing energy in the form of heat, light,

56
00:05:24,080 --> 00:05:30,080
and radiation. A similar blob of energy, Maxlow speculates, is found at the centre of the Earth

57
00:05:30,080 --> 00:05:36,480
and the new energy is converted into matter. Only one problem. When fusion takes place,

58
00:05:36,480 --> 00:05:41,680
because that's what we're talking about, matter is converted into energy. So if you then convert

59
00:05:41,680 --> 00:05:47,360
that energy back into matter, there's no net gain of mass. It's rather like having an electric car

60
00:05:47,360 --> 00:05:52,960
with a generator that charges the battery and using the battery to run the car. You just can't

61
00:05:52,960 --> 00:05:58,400
do it. Leaving aside the question of whether we actually have nuclear fusion happening at the

62
00:05:58,400 --> 00:06:09,200
centre of the Earth. Okay, now, Joe. Oh, dropped my ear up in Asian. Ah never mind, we'll come back

63
00:06:09,200 --> 00:06:14,640
to you. Two years on and I check Neil Adams' website again. He's still sticking by his theory

64
00:06:14,640 --> 00:06:20,560
and still bristling at any criticism of it. But even the imaginary blobs of energy and bubbles

65
00:06:20,560 --> 00:06:25,680
of nothing are not the definitive answer as to why an expanding Earth is absolute nonsense.

66
00:06:25,680 --> 00:06:30,080
The reason we know the Earth isn't expanding is because we can measure it directly.

67
00:06:30,640 --> 00:06:35,280
And there's no sign at all that the Earth is growing or has been growing since these

68
00:06:35,280 --> 00:06:40,080
measurements began. On the other hand, we can measure uplift in mountain ranges by several

69
00:06:40,080 --> 00:06:45,440
millimetres a year and along tectonic fault lines and these are entirely consistent with plate

70
00:06:45,440 --> 00:06:51,360
tectonics. Remember it was when plate tectonics came along that the idea of an expanding Earth

71
00:06:51,360 --> 00:06:56,800
was discarded as a way of explaining the drift of continents. Plate tectonics does that job

72
00:06:56,800 --> 00:07:02,400
admirably and with a mountain of evidence to support it. It shows that as new crust is formed

73
00:07:02,400 --> 00:07:07,200
along mid-ocean ridges, it doesn't keep building up to make the Earth bigger. It moves like a

74
00:07:07,200 --> 00:07:12,160
conveyor belt, eventually subducting under a larger and thicker continent. The magnetic

75
00:07:12,160 --> 00:07:16,800
polarity of the rocks moving away from these mid-ocean ridges shows its alignment to the

76
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:22,800
magnetic poles at the time it was formed. Through geological time these change as the Earth's poles

77
00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:27,600
flip over. We can measure the drift of the continents so we know exactly which direction

78
00:07:27,600 --> 00:07:33,120
they're moving in and how fast. We can see where they were in the past through fossil vegetation

79
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:37,760
and how they were oriented because of the polarity of their volcanic rocks. We can see

80
00:07:37,760 --> 00:07:43,040
which continents were joined and how through their shared stratigraphy and paleontology.

81
00:07:43,040 --> 00:07:48,640
That means the order and type of rock and the fossils these rocks carry. We can measure uplift

82
00:07:48,640 --> 00:07:54,080
in places where plates are colliding today. We can even visualise subduction taking place

83
00:07:54,080 --> 00:07:58,880
by plotting the source of earthquakes as the subducting plate jars against the thicker plate.

84
00:07:59,840 --> 00:08:05,120
In other words, continental drift is explained perfectly by the circulation system of oceanic

85
00:08:05,120 --> 00:08:10,320
crust. Adams and Maxlow's hypothesis not only overturns everything we know about...

86
00:08:10,320 --> 00:08:15,920
Not now, Joe! It not only overturns everything we know about seismology, paleontology,

87
00:08:15,920 --> 00:08:22,320
glaciology, stratigraphy and volcanology. It also overturns many of the disciplines within physics

88
00:08:22,320 --> 00:08:28,640
about where matter comes from, what energy is and how elements are formed. The astonishing thing is

89
00:08:28,960 --> 00:08:35,360
that this silly 19th century idea has been dormant for more than half a century. But all it takes is

90
00:08:35,360 --> 00:08:40,800
a slick piece of video graphics and an electronic soapbox to the world and people are willing to

91
00:08:40,800 --> 00:08:54,960
believe it. Oh, I nearly forgot! Now, Joe! Now!
