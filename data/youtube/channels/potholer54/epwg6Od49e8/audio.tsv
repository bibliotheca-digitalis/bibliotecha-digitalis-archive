0	7440	They know but are not telling you that the upper tectonic plates of Earth also join in the Pacific.
7440	12240	I thought I'd take a break from conspiracies to promote evolution and conspiracies to fake
12240	17280	climate change to tackle another conspiracy of evil scientists to hide from us the fact
17280	23120	that our Earth is expanding. Once again, this isn't just a hypothesis according to its adherence,
23120	28560	it's the irrefutable truth. The idea that the Earth has been expanding dates back to the 19th
28560	34800	century as a way of explaining another scientific hypothesis, continental drift. But with the advent
34800	40080	of plate tectonics, the expanding Earth idea has gone the same way as the flat Earth and the Earth
40080	45520	centred universe. In other words, some people still believe it. And now that we live in the
45520	50560	age of the internet, where wacky ideas can be spread by anyone with a pulse and a keyboard,
50560	53840	the expanding Earth idea has been revived. My name is Joe.
54720	62880	Okay, not yet, Joe. Apart from Joe, a creationist who thinks the expanding Earth explains the
62880	68960	biblical flood, there's also a living geologist attached to the idea, James Maxlow. But nearly
68960	73360	all the messages I got alerting me to the expanding Earth flammory referred to this
73360	79440	video by comic book artist Neil Adams. It shows very slickly just how well all the continents
79440	84640	fit together as we reduce the size of the Earth. No twisting, no form-fitting. Well,
84640	89600	let's be honest, quite a few places do have to be squashed to make them fit, like Alaska.
93040	97760	No altering shapes or sizes. Not quite true either. Adams has taken the shapes of the
97760	103040	continents as they appear in an atlas. But these are just the parts of the continental crust that
103040	108080	are above sea level. In fact, the continents are bigger and their shapes are different because the
108080	113840	true edges are the continental shelves. But never mind that Adams got the shape and the size of the
113840	118640	continents wrong and had to squash them to make them fit. That's not what really debunks the
118640	123840	notion of an expanding Earth. Two years ago, when someone first messaged me about the video,
123840	128960	I wrote to Neil Adams with a simple question. If the Earth has been gaining all this mass,
128960	135200	where does the extra mass come from? The answer I got referred to superheated denseness, like a
135200	142080	giant electromagnetic engine creating energy like a small confined sun. And no, I couldn't make head
142080	148080	or tail of it either. It certainly didn't explain where the extra mass came from. So let's try James
148080	153680	Maxlow, the geologist who's been advocating the expanding Earth theory for over 30 years. If anyone
153680	159840	can explain where the extra mass came from, he can. So where did all this mass come from? I don't know.
159840	167680	Oh. So if Maxlow, the geologist, doesn't know, I suppose we've got no choice but to have another
167680	176560	stab at Neil Adams. I asked again about... Not now, Joe. I asked again about where the extra mass came
176560	183120	from. Eventually, I got this. Pretend we have pipes going to the core and as you convert hydrogen to
183120	188640	helium and release more energy, we pump more prime matter down the pipes. For that new energy to
188640	195760	impact in new pair production cooling it down. Now we make more helium and pump in more prime matter.
195760	203360	That's how it works. Prime matter has infacing fields and can flow anywhere. What this tells us
203360	208960	is that Adams thinks nuclear fusion, which takes place in the centre of stars, is taking place in
208960	214560	the centre of the Earth. Pair production is real enough when energy condenses into a positron and
214560	220160	electron, but these particles are short-lived. They aren't atoms and they turn back into energy
220160	226000	in a fraction of a second. And what's prime matter? Well, Adams says it's some sort of potential
226000	232320	matter floating around in space and you can't see, touch or detect it. It was first theorized by...
232320	238560	No, not Einstein. No, not Hawking either. It was first theorized by an ancient Greek philosopher,
238640	243440	Aristotle. I tried to understand what this imagined substance might be.
244080	247760	Adams grew increasingly frustrated as he tried to explain it to me.
248640	254880	Imagine nothing. A force pulls outward on it, spin to make it less than nothing. You get undetectable
254880	260480	bubbles distributing the pressure. The bubble is an electron. At its centre is a point particle we
260480	266800	call a positron. Actually we call it a positron too, Neil, if I'm thinking of the same positron that you
266800	274320	are. If you pop the point positron out with a high energy photon you will get matter. So if you put
274320	278560	the whole thing together it's bubbles of nothing going down pretend pipes into a mini sun at the
278560	283680	centre of the Earth. I'm probably not explaining it any better than Adams is, but then I don't have
283680	288400	a clue as to what he's on about. This is new age hippie speak, not the language of science.
289040	294080	Adams assured me that the reason I don't understand it is because I've been brainwashed by science
294080	299120	and I'm just not thinking. Different materials. Let's go back to Maxlow who says he doesn't know
299120	304720	how new matter forms either, but of course that doesn't stop him speculating. Whatever the sun
304720	313680	is made of. Whatever the sun is made of? It's made of hydrogen and helium. Oh whatever. This blob of
313680	319760	pure energy, whatever, plasma, whatever. The sun isn't a blob of pure energy, it's a concentration
319760	324080	of hydrogen that's fusing into helium and releasing energy in the form of heat, light,
324080	330080	and radiation. A similar blob of energy, Maxlow speculates, is found at the centre of the Earth
330080	336480	and the new energy is converted into matter. Only one problem. When fusion takes place,
336480	341680	because that's what we're talking about, matter is converted into energy. So if you then convert
341680	347360	that energy back into matter, there's no net gain of mass. It's rather like having an electric car
347360	352960	with a generator that charges the battery and using the battery to run the car. You just can't
352960	358400	do it. Leaving aside the question of whether we actually have nuclear fusion happening at the
358400	369200	centre of the Earth. Okay, now, Joe. Oh, dropped my ear up in Asian. Ah never mind, we'll come back
369200	374640	to you. Two years on and I check Neil Adams' website again. He's still sticking by his theory
374640	380560	and still bristling at any criticism of it. But even the imaginary blobs of energy and bubbles
380560	385680	of nothing are not the definitive answer as to why an expanding Earth is absolute nonsense.
385680	390080	The reason we know the Earth isn't expanding is because we can measure it directly.
390640	395280	And there's no sign at all that the Earth is growing or has been growing since these
395280	400080	measurements began. On the other hand, we can measure uplift in mountain ranges by several
400080	405440	millimetres a year and along tectonic fault lines and these are entirely consistent with plate
405440	411360	tectonics. Remember it was when plate tectonics came along that the idea of an expanding Earth
411360	416800	was discarded as a way of explaining the drift of continents. Plate tectonics does that job
416800	422400	admirably and with a mountain of evidence to support it. It shows that as new crust is formed
422400	427200	along mid-ocean ridges, it doesn't keep building up to make the Earth bigger. It moves like a
427200	432160	conveyor belt, eventually subducting under a larger and thicker continent. The magnetic
432160	436800	polarity of the rocks moving away from these mid-ocean ridges shows its alignment to the
436800	442800	magnetic poles at the time it was formed. Through geological time these change as the Earth's poles
442800	447600	flip over. We can measure the drift of the continents so we know exactly which direction
447600	453120	they're moving in and how fast. We can see where they were in the past through fossil vegetation
453120	457760	and how they were oriented because of the polarity of their volcanic rocks. We can see
457760	463040	which continents were joined and how through their shared stratigraphy and paleontology.
463040	468640	That means the order and type of rock and the fossils these rocks carry. We can measure uplift
468640	474080	in places where plates are colliding today. We can even visualise subduction taking place
474080	478880	by plotting the source of earthquakes as the subducting plate jars against the thicker plate.
479840	485120	In other words, continental drift is explained perfectly by the circulation system of oceanic
485120	490320	crust. Adams and Maxlow's hypothesis not only overturns everything we know about...
490320	495920	Not now, Joe! It not only overturns everything we know about seismology, paleontology,
495920	502320	glaciology, stratigraphy and volcanology. It also overturns many of the disciplines within physics
502320	508640	about where matter comes from, what energy is and how elements are formed. The astonishing thing is
508960	515360	that this silly 19th century idea has been dormant for more than half a century. But all it takes is
515360	520800	a slick piece of video graphics and an electronic soapbox to the world and people are willing to
520800	534960	believe it. Oh, I nearly forgot! Now, Joe! Now!
