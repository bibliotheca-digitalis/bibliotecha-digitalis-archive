1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,060
Great, steaming lumps of Thirk!

2
00:00:03,060 --> 00:00:05,560
Kent Hovind's busted out of jail.

3
00:00:05,560 --> 00:00:09,520
And what a wonderful gift the Lugemeister gave me on his release.

4
00:00:09,520 --> 00:00:14,100
In his very first video, he starts off talking about something that was going to be the subject

5
00:00:14,100 --> 00:00:16,760
of my next video, this video.

6
00:00:16,760 --> 00:00:20,080
But if you add up the dates given in the Bible, you'll find what everybody else has found

7
00:00:20,080 --> 00:00:21,680
through history that's done this.

8
00:00:21,680 --> 00:00:26,520
The Bible dates indicate the Earth was created in six days about 6,000 years ago.

9
00:00:26,520 --> 00:00:29,820
It is not millions or billions of years old.

10
00:00:29,820 --> 00:00:32,660
So this top timeline kind of indicates what the Bible teaches.

11
00:00:32,660 --> 00:00:37,140
6,000 years ago, or 4,000 BC, God created everything.

12
00:00:37,140 --> 00:00:42,140
4,400 years ago, there was a big flood in the days of Noah that destroyed everything.

13
00:00:42,140 --> 00:00:47,360
And that flood explains all the geology of the world, the canyons, the mountain ranges,

14
00:00:47,360 --> 00:00:49,700
the ocean basins, the continental shelf.

15
00:00:49,700 --> 00:00:54,140
And we cover all that on video number five or six of our series, which you can see right

16
00:00:54,140 --> 00:00:56,140
here on the YouTube channel.

17
00:00:56,140 --> 00:01:00,740
When Jesus came 2,000 years ago, and here we are today, 2015, today happens to be July

18
00:01:00,740 --> 00:01:06,740
20th, and the Lord's coming back probably, hopefully, soon, next to 10, 15 years, we'll

19
00:01:06,740 --> 00:01:07,740
see about that.

20
00:01:07,740 --> 00:01:12,620
Yeah, that's kind of what fundamentalists have been saying for the last 2,000 years.

21
00:01:12,620 --> 00:01:16,900
But credit where credit's due, Kent Hovind's absolutely right.

22
00:01:16,900 --> 00:01:21,080
Seriously, if you add up the dates in the Bible, they produce an age for the universe

23
00:01:21,080 --> 00:01:24,260
and the Earth of just 6,000 years.

24
00:01:24,260 --> 00:01:29,780
That's why we know the Bible's full of crap, at least when it comes to scientific details.

25
00:01:29,780 --> 00:01:35,020
Because we've already seen in previous videos how four billion years of geological history

26
00:01:35,020 --> 00:01:39,980
doesn't fit into just 6,000 years, and how three and a half billion years of evolutionary

27
00:01:39,980 --> 00:01:43,900
history doesn't fit into just 4,500 years.

28
00:01:43,900 --> 00:01:48,780
And in this video, we're going to see how over 5,000 years of Egyptian history can't

29
00:01:48,780 --> 00:01:51,500
squeeze into 3,000 years.

30
00:01:51,500 --> 00:01:55,740
And unusually for this channel, we're not going to do it with historical, archaeological,

31
00:01:55,740 --> 00:01:57,800
or scientific evidence.

32
00:01:57,800 --> 00:01:59,260
That would be too easy.

33
00:01:59,260 --> 00:02:03,020
I'm going to let creationists argue with themselves.

34
00:02:03,020 --> 00:02:08,060
For example, the fundamentalist encyclopedia, Conservopedia, tells us the chronology of

35
00:02:08,060 --> 00:02:14,380
ancient Egypt, the idea that Egyptian civilization is 5,000 years old, is the least settled of

36
00:02:14,380 --> 00:02:17,740
all the chronologies of the great powers of the ancient Near East.

37
00:02:17,740 --> 00:02:19,340
Highly dubious at best.

38
00:02:19,380 --> 00:02:23,060
Moreover, an increasing body of evidence now suggests that the history of ancient Egypt

39
00:02:23,060 --> 00:02:27,980
is shorter, by several millennia, than most scholars have previously supposed.

40
00:02:27,980 --> 00:02:33,060
More recent research now strongly supports the original conclusion of James Usher.

41
00:02:33,060 --> 00:02:38,140
In other words, it supports Usher's conclusion that the world is just 6,000 years old, and

42
00:02:38,140 --> 00:02:43,700
that Egyptian civilization arose after the Biblical flood 4,500 years ago.

43
00:02:43,700 --> 00:02:45,660
What research supports this?

44
00:02:45,660 --> 00:02:48,660
Maybe a paper in the Journal of Archaeological Research?

45
00:02:48,660 --> 00:02:49,940
Or Egyptian Archaeology?

46
00:02:49,940 --> 00:02:52,380
Or the International Journal of Historical Archaeology?

47
00:02:52,380 --> 00:02:53,540
Or World Archaeology?

48
00:02:53,540 --> 00:02:55,260
Or the Journal of Egyptian Archaeology?

49
00:02:55,260 --> 00:02:57,300
Or the Journal of Anthropology and Archaeology?

50
00:02:57,300 --> 00:02:59,300
I can't wait to find out.

51
00:02:59,300 --> 00:03:05,300
Well if we click on the reference link, we find it's a website run by Creationist Ministries

52
00:03:05,300 --> 00:03:07,180
International.

53
00:03:07,180 --> 00:03:11,980
This is Conservopedia's source that an increasing body of evidence now suggests that the history

54
00:03:11,980 --> 00:03:17,300
of ancient Egypt is shorter, by several millennia, than most scholars previously supposed.

55
00:03:17,300 --> 00:03:22,420
And it's based, as you can see, on Biblical stories, and what Creationist Ministry International

56
00:03:22,420 --> 00:03:25,580
calls the truth and authority of the Bible.

57
00:03:25,580 --> 00:03:30,440
Meanwhile most scholars, and most encyclopedias, still go with the wealth of archaeological

58
00:03:30,440 --> 00:03:31,740
evidence.

59
00:03:31,740 --> 00:03:33,740
Like this one.

60
00:03:33,740 --> 00:03:37,980
Egypt has endured as a unified state for more than 5,000 years, it says.

61
00:03:37,980 --> 00:03:41,940
And archaeological evidence indicates that a developed Egyptian society has existed for

62
00:03:41,940 --> 00:03:43,860
much longer.

63
00:03:43,860 --> 00:03:47,280
And another entry in the same encyclopaedia concurs.

64
00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:49,860
So which encyclopaedia is it?

65
00:03:49,860 --> 00:03:50,860
Wait what?

66
00:03:50,860 --> 00:03:52,340
Great knobbly plates of toast!

67
00:03:52,340 --> 00:03:53,660
It's Conservopedia.

68
00:03:53,660 --> 00:03:59,060
The same encyclopaedia that told us this great age was dubious at best, and contradicted

69
00:03:59,060 --> 00:04:01,060
by more recent research.

70
00:04:01,060 --> 00:04:06,820
And if we click on the link to Egyptian Chronology, we come to, yes, that very page.

71
00:04:06,820 --> 00:04:12,100
So on the one hand, Conservopedia is telling us Egyptian civilization is 5,000 years old,

72
00:04:12,100 --> 00:04:16,380
and on the other hand, Conservopedia is telling us this is nonsense.

73
00:04:16,380 --> 00:04:20,740
That's what you get when you try to squeeze things into timescales that don't fit.

74
00:04:20,740 --> 00:04:23,940
You end up with your foot inside your own mouth.

75
00:04:23,940 --> 00:04:27,800
But again, I'm not going to argue with these creationists, I'll let them carry on arguing

76
00:04:27,800 --> 00:04:29,460
with themselves.

77
00:04:29,460 --> 00:04:36,460
According to answers in Genesis, the Biblical flood dates to 2,348 BC, and 160 years after

78
00:04:36,500 --> 00:04:41,940
the flood had subsided, according to answers in Genesis, a grandson of Noah, Mizraim, took

79
00:04:41,940 --> 00:04:47,140
his family to settle in Egypt in 2,188 BC.

80
00:04:47,140 --> 00:04:50,500
So when did his descendants build the first large pyramid?

81
00:04:50,500 --> 00:04:52,700
No, not that pyramid.

82
00:04:52,700 --> 00:04:56,500
This is the first large pyramid, called the step pyramid.

83
00:04:56,500 --> 00:05:02,320
Answers in Genesis tells us it was built between 2100 to 2000 BC.

84
00:05:02,320 --> 00:05:07,240
Although the pyramid builders would have started work on it just 88 years after AIG

85
00:05:07,240 --> 00:05:11,240
tells us the first family of humans arrived to settle Egypt.

86
00:05:11,240 --> 00:05:14,040
So how many people were around to do this?

87
00:05:14,040 --> 00:05:20,180
AIG claims that since the flood, the human population has doubled every 150 years.

88
00:05:20,180 --> 00:05:24,920
And if you double the population every 150 years, you conveniently go from 8 people on

89
00:05:24,920 --> 00:05:28,280
the ark to around 7 billion people on Earth today.

90
00:05:28,280 --> 00:05:34,080
AIG calls this estimate very conservative by comparing it with population growth in

91
00:05:34,080 --> 00:05:35,720
the modern era.

92
00:05:35,720 --> 00:05:40,760
But of course in the modern era we have medicine, inoculation against disease, sanitation, welfare,

93
00:05:40,760 --> 00:05:46,240
trade, improved food production, and all those things that allow populations to boom.

94
00:05:46,240 --> 00:05:50,720
The historical and archaeological evidence shows that from the time of Jesus, it was

95
00:05:50,720 --> 00:05:55,160
1650 years before the population doubled.

96
00:05:55,160 --> 00:05:58,560
So AIG is out by a factor of around 10.

97
00:05:58,560 --> 00:06:02,640
But of course we're not going to use any of that fancy schmancy scientific or historical

98
00:06:02,640 --> 00:06:03,640
evidence.

99
00:06:03,640 --> 00:06:06,060
Let's go with AIG's figures.

100
00:06:06,060 --> 00:06:13,040
They say Egypt was founded by Mizraim and his family of 8 people in 2188 BC.

101
00:06:13,040 --> 00:06:20,480
And AIG says the earliest date for the pyramids was 2100 BC, just 88 years later.

102
00:06:20,480 --> 00:06:25,140
And AIG says the population doubled every 150 years.

103
00:06:25,140 --> 00:06:28,060
So it's just a simple mathematical calculation.

104
00:06:28,060 --> 00:06:34,820
By 2100 BC there would have been about 12 of them.

105
00:06:34,820 --> 00:06:38,740
Well OK, let's say they just started work in 2100 BC.

106
00:06:38,740 --> 00:06:44,200
They've still got another 100 years to finish the project according to AIG's date range.

107
00:06:44,200 --> 00:06:48,380
So there could be thousands of people toiling on the project by the end of it.

108
00:06:48,380 --> 00:06:49,500
No.

109
00:06:49,500 --> 00:06:55,020
According to AIG's population growth estimates, the descendants of Mizraim in 2000 BC would

110
00:06:55,020 --> 00:06:58,700
have numbered just over 16.

111
00:06:58,700 --> 00:07:02,720
Well AIG reasons maybe they had slaves.

112
00:07:02,720 --> 00:07:07,260
But that still doesn't solve the problem, because according to AIG the world population

113
00:07:07,260 --> 00:07:11,260
in 2350 BC was just 8.

114
00:07:11,260 --> 00:07:16,180
So even if the entire world population was involved in building the first pyramid, that's

115
00:07:16,180 --> 00:07:20,980
still less than 40 people by the year 2000 BC.

116
00:07:20,980 --> 00:07:25,460
Well surely they had labour saving devices like cranes and hoists.

117
00:07:25,460 --> 00:07:27,900
Yes, presumably they did.

118
00:07:27,900 --> 00:07:32,360
But they not only had to move the blocks and hoist them into place, they also had to quarry

119
00:07:32,360 --> 00:07:36,880
them and shape them with copper tools, and someone had to mine the copper, and someone

120
00:07:36,880 --> 00:07:41,900
had to smelt the metal, and make the tools, and someone had to sharpen the tools, which

121
00:07:41,900 --> 00:07:45,880
would get blunt very quickly, and someone had to make the dinner, and someone had to

122
00:07:45,880 --> 00:07:50,520
grow the food, and someone had to make the tools to grow the food, beginning to look

123
00:07:50,520 --> 00:07:54,720
like 40 men, women and children just weren't enough.

124
00:07:54,720 --> 00:07:59,540
To get around this problem, Answers in Genesis does a bit of double bookkeeping.

125
00:07:59,540 --> 00:08:02,680
Change the rate of growth to make it fit.

126
00:08:02,680 --> 00:08:04,960
So what do we need to build a pyramid?

127
00:08:04,960 --> 00:08:07,220
Let's say about 30,000 people.

128
00:08:07,220 --> 00:08:12,400
And how do we get from one married couple to 30,000 in just 150 years?

129
00:08:12,400 --> 00:08:18,400
Well you have to double the population every 15 years, not every 150.

130
00:08:18,400 --> 00:08:20,680
So now that becomes the rate of growth.

131
00:08:20,680 --> 00:08:24,200
AIG calls this probably quite conservative.

132
00:08:24,200 --> 00:08:29,120
I'm glad to see there's now an element of doubt in a population growth 100 times faster

133
00:08:29,120 --> 00:08:31,680
than the historical record shows.

134
00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:36,080
The new figure represents a breakneck speed of growth, and that creates another problem

135
00:08:36,080 --> 00:08:37,080
for AIG.

136
00:08:37,080 --> 00:08:42,820
A doubling of population every 15 years would mean Noah's three sons and their wives would

137
00:08:42,820 --> 00:08:47,900
have given us a population of 12 in 2335 BC.

138
00:08:47,900 --> 00:08:54,580
By 1885 BC, long before the founding of Rome, the population of the world would be nearly

139
00:08:54,580 --> 00:08:58,700
double what it is today, 12.9 billion.

140
00:08:58,700 --> 00:09:03,420
And if you extrapolated to the year 2015, there'd be more people on the planet than

141
00:09:03,420 --> 00:09:05,260
stars in the sky.

142
00:09:05,260 --> 00:09:10,180
We'd be groaning under the weight of trillions upon trillions of people.

143
00:09:10,180 --> 00:09:15,540
So how does AIG reconcile these two completely different population growth rates?

144
00:09:15,540 --> 00:09:16,740
It doesn't.

145
00:09:16,740 --> 00:09:18,340
It's like creative accounting.

146
00:09:18,340 --> 00:09:22,320
If people want to know how it's possible to reach a population of 7 billion in just a

147
00:09:22,320 --> 00:09:27,020
few thousand years, they're directed to one set of books that says the population doubled

148
00:09:27,020 --> 00:09:29,180
every 150 years.

149
00:09:29,180 --> 00:09:32,580
If they want to know how it's possible to reach a population capable of building the

150
00:09:32,580 --> 00:09:38,420
pyramids in just 150 years, direct them to another set of books that says the population

151
00:09:38,420 --> 00:09:41,980
doubled every 15 years 10 times faster.

152
00:09:41,980 --> 00:09:47,980
Just hope no one asks both questions at the same time in the same room.

153
00:09:47,980 --> 00:09:52,500
Then we come on to another problem of trying to contort 500 million years of history into

154
00:09:52,500 --> 00:09:54,420
just 4,000 years.

155
00:09:54,420 --> 00:09:57,020
What on earth are the pyramids made of?

156
00:09:57,020 --> 00:09:59,340
Well, sandstone, of course.

157
00:09:59,340 --> 00:10:02,840
But this must be some kind of miraculous sandstone, surely.

158
00:10:02,840 --> 00:10:08,180
After all, sandstone is made of sand that's compressed and, over time, cemented together

159
00:10:08,180 --> 00:10:12,940
to form rocks solid enough to support the weight of several tonnes of pyramid.

160
00:10:12,940 --> 00:10:18,140
According to AIG, all the sedimentary rocks we find, including sandstone, were deposited

161
00:10:18,140 --> 00:10:19,900
by the global flood.

162
00:10:19,900 --> 00:10:24,320
So after the flood, they would have looked like this, soft and wet.

163
00:10:24,320 --> 00:10:28,900
So how can they form themselves into blocks of sandstone rock capable of holding up a

164
00:10:28,900 --> 00:10:33,500
massive pyramid in just 250 years?

165
00:10:33,500 --> 00:10:36,540
Answers in Genesis, as usual, has no answer.

166
00:10:36,540 --> 00:10:41,180
The closest I could get was this page, which said millions of years aren't needed for rocks

167
00:10:41,180 --> 00:10:45,420
to solidify, just compaction and the presence of cementing agents.

168
00:10:45,420 --> 00:10:47,960
Well, here's the problem with that.

169
00:10:47,960 --> 00:10:52,340
We know where the sandstone used to make the pyramids was quarried from, and it was near

170
00:10:52,340 --> 00:10:55,180
the surface, so it wasn't compacted.

171
00:10:55,180 --> 00:10:59,800
And if there were miraculous cementing agents, then how come this sand hasn't turned into

172
00:10:59,800 --> 00:11:03,100
solid rock in over 2,000 years?

173
00:11:03,140 --> 00:11:07,300
Archaeologists have found tonnes of sand used to fill in chambers, and they were sealed

174
00:11:07,300 --> 00:11:09,140
when the pyramids were built.

175
00:11:09,140 --> 00:11:15,780
They found skeletons from the time buried in sand, and the sand is still loose 2,000 years later.

176
00:11:15,780 --> 00:11:20,960
Yes, I know, if God could turn water into wine, then he could instantly turn sand into rock.

177
00:11:20,960 --> 00:11:26,220
But AIG goes to great lengths to show how the flood, and all the rocks it supposedly

178
00:11:26,220 --> 00:11:31,040
formed, happened naturally, without resorting to magical solutions.

179
00:11:31,040 --> 00:11:36,080
So once again, answers in Genesis has no answers, so I look forward to your letters.

180
00:11:36,080 --> 00:11:40,800
Oh, and before the creationists out there yell at me for ignoring the explanation AIG

181
00:11:40,800 --> 00:11:45,880
gives as to how clocks and spark plugs and handbags and hats have petrified, in other

182
00:11:45,880 --> 00:11:51,160
words turned into rock, in just a few years, I haven't ignored it, I've covered this nonsense

183
00:11:51,160 --> 00:11:55,360
in my video Rapid Fossilisation of Hats Debunked.

184
00:11:55,360 --> 00:11:58,360
To recap, these objects haven't been petrified.

185
00:11:58,360 --> 00:12:03,920
They've had concretions deposited on them, in much the same way as concretions form around

186
00:12:03,920 --> 00:12:09,040
the sinkhole in your bath, or in objects placed in heavily mineralised water.

187
00:12:09,040 --> 00:12:13,700
So we have two problems with building the pyramids in a post-flood world.

188
00:12:13,700 --> 00:12:16,580
No people, and no sandstone.

189
00:12:16,580 --> 00:12:22,200
And if AIG wants to argue that there were enough people, then guys just talk among yourselves,

190
00:12:22,200 --> 00:12:27,120
because elsewhere on your channel you show very convincingly that there weren't.

191
00:12:27,640 --> 00:12:32,720
Ah, but it's not all bad news for creationists, at least you have Kent Hovind back.

192
00:12:32,720 --> 00:12:37,320
And on behalf of the atheist community, I'm delighted to welcome him out of prison.

193
00:12:37,320 --> 00:12:41,080
Because as you know, I have a love-hate relationship with creationists.

194
00:12:41,080 --> 00:12:45,360
They're so nice and lovable, and they probably feel the same way about us.

195
00:12:45,360 --> 00:12:50,200
I'm sure they understand that we could all be friends if only… well, you know how those

196
00:12:50,200 --> 00:12:53,140
dumb beliefs just keep getting in the way.

197
00:12:53,140 --> 00:12:55,720
I don't know, I just can't put it into words.

198
00:12:55,720 --> 00:12:59,240
Perhaps the best way to express it is in songs.

199
00:13:25,720 --> 00:13:31,860
And then I go and spoil it all by saying something stupid like

200
00:13:31,860 --> 00:13:35,580
The Earth was created in six days about 6,000 years ago.

201
00:13:35,580 --> 00:13:43,380
I practise every day to find some clever lines to say to make the meaning come true.

202
00:13:43,380 --> 00:13:52,580
But then I think I'll wait until the evening gets late and I'm alone with you.

203
00:13:52,580 --> 00:14:03,580
The time is right, your perfume fills my head, the stars get red and oh, the night's so blue.

204
00:14:03,580 --> 00:14:08,580
And then I go and spoil it all by saying something stupid like

205
00:14:08,580 --> 00:14:11,080
This is a dinosaur bone and I want you to carbon date it.

206
00:14:11,080 --> 00:14:19,580
They would have said, oh, we can't date that because it's too old.

207
00:14:19,580 --> 00:14:21,580
There's no way! There's no f***ing carbon in it!

208
00:14:31,580 --> 00:14:40,580
The time is right, your perfume fills my head, the stars get red and oh, the night's so blue.

209
00:14:40,580 --> 00:14:44,580
And then I go and spoil it all by saying something stupid like

210
00:14:44,580 --> 00:14:49,580
You'll find the maker of a banana, Almighty God, has made it with a non-slip surface.

211
00:14:49,580 --> 00:14:55,580
Dinosaurs which are having trouble breathing and cause their nostrils to come alight and breathe out fire.
