0	3060	Great, steaming lumps of Thirk!
3060	5560	Kent Hovind's busted out of jail.
5560	9520	And what a wonderful gift the Lugemeister gave me on his release.
9520	14100	In his very first video, he starts off talking about something that was going to be the subject
14100	16760	of my next video, this video.
16760	20080	But if you add up the dates given in the Bible, you'll find what everybody else has found
20080	21680	through history that's done this.
21680	26520	The Bible dates indicate the Earth was created in six days about 6,000 years ago.
26520	29820	It is not millions or billions of years old.
29820	32660	So this top timeline kind of indicates what the Bible teaches.
32660	37140	6,000 years ago, or 4,000 BC, God created everything.
37140	42140	4,400 years ago, there was a big flood in the days of Noah that destroyed everything.
42140	47360	And that flood explains all the geology of the world, the canyons, the mountain ranges,
47360	49700	the ocean basins, the continental shelf.
49700	54140	And we cover all that on video number five or six of our series, which you can see right
54140	56140	here on the YouTube channel.
56140	60740	When Jesus came 2,000 years ago, and here we are today, 2015, today happens to be July
60740	66740	20th, and the Lord's coming back probably, hopefully, soon, next to 10, 15 years, we'll
66740	67740	see about that.
67740	72620	Yeah, that's kind of what fundamentalists have been saying for the last 2,000 years.
72620	76900	But credit where credit's due, Kent Hovind's absolutely right.
76900	81080	Seriously, if you add up the dates in the Bible, they produce an age for the universe
81080	84260	and the Earth of just 6,000 years.
84260	89780	That's why we know the Bible's full of crap, at least when it comes to scientific details.
89780	95020	Because we've already seen in previous videos how four billion years of geological history
95020	99980	doesn't fit into just 6,000 years, and how three and a half billion years of evolutionary
99980	103900	history doesn't fit into just 4,500 years.
103900	108780	And in this video, we're going to see how over 5,000 years of Egyptian history can't
108780	111500	squeeze into 3,000 years.
111500	115740	And unusually for this channel, we're not going to do it with historical, archaeological,
115740	117800	or scientific evidence.
117800	119260	That would be too easy.
119260	123020	I'm going to let creationists argue with themselves.
123020	128060	For example, the fundamentalist encyclopedia, Conservopedia, tells us the chronology of
128060	134380	ancient Egypt, the idea that Egyptian civilization is 5,000 years old, is the least settled of
134380	137740	all the chronologies of the great powers of the ancient Near East.
137740	139340	Highly dubious at best.
139380	143060	Moreover, an increasing body of evidence now suggests that the history of ancient Egypt
143060	147980	is shorter, by several millennia, than most scholars have previously supposed.
147980	153060	More recent research now strongly supports the original conclusion of James Usher.
153060	158140	In other words, it supports Usher's conclusion that the world is just 6,000 years old, and
158140	163700	that Egyptian civilization arose after the Biblical flood 4,500 years ago.
163700	165660	What research supports this?
165660	168660	Maybe a paper in the Journal of Archaeological Research?
168660	169940	Or Egyptian Archaeology?
169940	172380	Or the International Journal of Historical Archaeology?
172380	173540	Or World Archaeology?
173540	175260	Or the Journal of Egyptian Archaeology?
175260	177300	Or the Journal of Anthropology and Archaeology?
177300	179300	I can't wait to find out.
179300	185300	Well if we click on the reference link, we find it's a website run by Creationist Ministries
185300	187180	International.
187180	191980	This is Conservopedia's source that an increasing body of evidence now suggests that the history
191980	197300	of ancient Egypt is shorter, by several millennia, than most scholars previously supposed.
197300	202420	And it's based, as you can see, on Biblical stories, and what Creationist Ministry International
202420	205580	calls the truth and authority of the Bible.
205580	210440	Meanwhile most scholars, and most encyclopedias, still go with the wealth of archaeological
210440	211740	evidence.
211740	213740	Like this one.
213740	217980	Egypt has endured as a unified state for more than 5,000 years, it says.
217980	221940	And archaeological evidence indicates that a developed Egyptian society has existed for
221940	223860	much longer.
223860	227280	And another entry in the same encyclopaedia concurs.
227280	229860	So which encyclopaedia is it?
229860	230860	Wait what?
230860	232340	Great knobbly plates of toast!
232340	233660	It's Conservopedia.
233660	239060	The same encyclopaedia that told us this great age was dubious at best, and contradicted
239060	241060	by more recent research.
241060	246820	And if we click on the link to Egyptian Chronology, we come to, yes, that very page.
246820	252100	So on the one hand, Conservopedia is telling us Egyptian civilization is 5,000 years old,
252100	256380	and on the other hand, Conservopedia is telling us this is nonsense.
256380	260740	That's what you get when you try to squeeze things into timescales that don't fit.
260740	263940	You end up with your foot inside your own mouth.
263940	267800	But again, I'm not going to argue with these creationists, I'll let them carry on arguing
267800	269460	with themselves.
269460	276460	According to answers in Genesis, the Biblical flood dates to 2,348 BC, and 160 years after
276500	281940	the flood had subsided, according to answers in Genesis, a grandson of Noah, Mizraim, took
281940	287140	his family to settle in Egypt in 2,188 BC.
287140	290500	So when did his descendants build the first large pyramid?
290500	292700	No, not that pyramid.
292700	296500	This is the first large pyramid, called the step pyramid.
296500	302320	Answers in Genesis tells us it was built between 2100 to 2000 BC.
302320	307240	Although the pyramid builders would have started work on it just 88 years after AIG
307240	311240	tells us the first family of humans arrived to settle Egypt.
311240	314040	So how many people were around to do this?
314040	320180	AIG claims that since the flood, the human population has doubled every 150 years.
320180	324920	And if you double the population every 150 years, you conveniently go from 8 people on
324920	328280	the ark to around 7 billion people on Earth today.
328280	334080	AIG calls this estimate very conservative by comparing it with population growth in
334080	335720	the modern era.
335720	340760	But of course in the modern era we have medicine, inoculation against disease, sanitation, welfare,
340760	346240	trade, improved food production, and all those things that allow populations to boom.
346240	350720	The historical and archaeological evidence shows that from the time of Jesus, it was
350720	355160	1650 years before the population doubled.
355160	358560	So AIG is out by a factor of around 10.
358560	362640	But of course we're not going to use any of that fancy schmancy scientific or historical
362640	363640	evidence.
363640	366060	Let's go with AIG's figures.
366060	373040	They say Egypt was founded by Mizraim and his family of 8 people in 2188 BC.
373040	380480	And AIG says the earliest date for the pyramids was 2100 BC, just 88 years later.
380480	385140	And AIG says the population doubled every 150 years.
385140	388060	So it's just a simple mathematical calculation.
388060	394820	By 2100 BC there would have been about 12 of them.
394820	398740	Well OK, let's say they just started work in 2100 BC.
398740	404200	They've still got another 100 years to finish the project according to AIG's date range.
404200	408380	So there could be thousands of people toiling on the project by the end of it.
408380	409500	No.
409500	415020	According to AIG's population growth estimates, the descendants of Mizraim in 2000 BC would
415020	418700	have numbered just over 16.
418700	422720	Well AIG reasons maybe they had slaves.
422720	427260	But that still doesn't solve the problem, because according to AIG the world population
427260	431260	in 2350 BC was just 8.
431260	436180	So even if the entire world population was involved in building the first pyramid, that's
436180	440980	still less than 40 people by the year 2000 BC.
440980	445460	Well surely they had labour saving devices like cranes and hoists.
445460	447900	Yes, presumably they did.
447900	452360	But they not only had to move the blocks and hoist them into place, they also had to quarry
452360	456880	them and shape them with copper tools, and someone had to mine the copper, and someone
456880	461900	had to smelt the metal, and make the tools, and someone had to sharpen the tools, which
461900	465880	would get blunt very quickly, and someone had to make the dinner, and someone had to
465880	470520	grow the food, and someone had to make the tools to grow the food, beginning to look
470520	474720	like 40 men, women and children just weren't enough.
474720	479540	To get around this problem, Answers in Genesis does a bit of double bookkeeping.
479540	482680	Change the rate of growth to make it fit.
482680	484960	So what do we need to build a pyramid?
484960	487220	Let's say about 30,000 people.
487220	492400	And how do we get from one married couple to 30,000 in just 150 years?
492400	498400	Well you have to double the population every 15 years, not every 150.
498400	500680	So now that becomes the rate of growth.
500680	504200	AIG calls this probably quite conservative.
504200	509120	I'm glad to see there's now an element of doubt in a population growth 100 times faster
509120	511680	than the historical record shows.
511680	516080	The new figure represents a breakneck speed of growth, and that creates another problem
516080	517080	for AIG.
517080	522820	A doubling of population every 15 years would mean Noah's three sons and their wives would
522820	527900	have given us a population of 12 in 2335 BC.
527900	534580	By 1885 BC, long before the founding of Rome, the population of the world would be nearly
534580	538700	double what it is today, 12.9 billion.
538700	543420	And if you extrapolated to the year 2015, there'd be more people on the planet than
543420	545260	stars in the sky.
545260	550180	We'd be groaning under the weight of trillions upon trillions of people.
550180	555540	So how does AIG reconcile these two completely different population growth rates?
555540	556740	It doesn't.
556740	558340	It's like creative accounting.
558340	562320	If people want to know how it's possible to reach a population of 7 billion in just a
562320	567020	few thousand years, they're directed to one set of books that says the population doubled
567020	569180	every 150 years.
569180	572580	If they want to know how it's possible to reach a population capable of building the
572580	578420	pyramids in just 150 years, direct them to another set of books that says the population
578420	581980	doubled every 15 years 10 times faster.
581980	587980	Just hope no one asks both questions at the same time in the same room.
587980	592500	Then we come on to another problem of trying to contort 500 million years of history into
592500	594420	just 4,000 years.
594420	597020	What on earth are the pyramids made of?
597020	599340	Well, sandstone, of course.
599340	602840	But this must be some kind of miraculous sandstone, surely.
602840	608180	After all, sandstone is made of sand that's compressed and, over time, cemented together
608180	612940	to form rocks solid enough to support the weight of several tonnes of pyramid.
612940	618140	According to AIG, all the sedimentary rocks we find, including sandstone, were deposited
618140	619900	by the global flood.
619900	624320	So after the flood, they would have looked like this, soft and wet.
624320	628900	So how can they form themselves into blocks of sandstone rock capable of holding up a
628900	633500	massive pyramid in just 250 years?
633500	636540	Answers in Genesis, as usual, has no answer.
636540	641180	The closest I could get was this page, which said millions of years aren't needed for rocks
641180	645420	to solidify, just compaction and the presence of cementing agents.
645420	647960	Well, here's the problem with that.
647960	652340	We know where the sandstone used to make the pyramids was quarried from, and it was near
652340	655180	the surface, so it wasn't compacted.
655180	659800	And if there were miraculous cementing agents, then how come this sand hasn't turned into
659800	663100	solid rock in over 2,000 years?
663140	667300	Archaeologists have found tonnes of sand used to fill in chambers, and they were sealed
667300	669140	when the pyramids were built.
669140	675780	They found skeletons from the time buried in sand, and the sand is still loose 2,000 years later.
675780	680960	Yes, I know, if God could turn water into wine, then he could instantly turn sand into rock.
680960	686220	But AIG goes to great lengths to show how the flood, and all the rocks it supposedly
686220	691040	formed, happened naturally, without resorting to magical solutions.
691040	696080	So once again, answers in Genesis has no answers, so I look forward to your letters.
696080	700800	Oh, and before the creationists out there yell at me for ignoring the explanation AIG
700800	705880	gives as to how clocks and spark plugs and handbags and hats have petrified, in other
705880	711160	words turned into rock, in just a few years, I haven't ignored it, I've covered this nonsense
711160	715360	in my video Rapid Fossilisation of Hats Debunked.
715360	718360	To recap, these objects haven't been petrified.
718360	723920	They've had concretions deposited on them, in much the same way as concretions form around
723920	729040	the sinkhole in your bath, or in objects placed in heavily mineralised water.
729040	733700	So we have two problems with building the pyramids in a post-flood world.
733700	736580	No people, and no sandstone.
736580	742200	And if AIG wants to argue that there were enough people, then guys just talk among yourselves,
742200	747120	because elsewhere on your channel you show very convincingly that there weren't.
747640	752720	Ah, but it's not all bad news for creationists, at least you have Kent Hovind back.
752720	757320	And on behalf of the atheist community, I'm delighted to welcome him out of prison.
757320	761080	Because as you know, I have a love-hate relationship with creationists.
761080	765360	They're so nice and lovable, and they probably feel the same way about us.
765360	770200	I'm sure they understand that we could all be friends if only… well, you know how those
770200	773140	dumb beliefs just keep getting in the way.
773140	775720	I don't know, I just can't put it into words.
775720	779240	Perhaps the best way to express it is in songs.
805720	811860	And then I go and spoil it all by saying something stupid like
811860	815580	The Earth was created in six days about 6,000 years ago.
815580	823380	I practise every day to find some clever lines to say to make the meaning come true.
823380	832580	But then I think I'll wait until the evening gets late and I'm alone with you.
832580	843580	The time is right, your perfume fills my head, the stars get red and oh, the night's so blue.
843580	848580	And then I go and spoil it all by saying something stupid like
848580	851080	This is a dinosaur bone and I want you to carbon date it.
851080	859580	They would have said, oh, we can't date that because it's too old.
859580	861580	There's no way! There's no f***ing carbon in it!
871580	880580	The time is right, your perfume fills my head, the stars get red and oh, the night's so blue.
880580	884580	And then I go and spoil it all by saying something stupid like
884580	889580	You'll find the maker of a banana, Almighty God, has made it with a non-slip surface.
889580	895580	Dinosaurs which are having trouble breathing and cause their nostrils to come alight and breathe out fire.
