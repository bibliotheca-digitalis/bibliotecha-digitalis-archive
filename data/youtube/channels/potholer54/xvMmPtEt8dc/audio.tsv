0	3120	It's not whether or not we're going through a global warming period.
3120	4440	We were, we're not now.
4440	7600	You know, God's still up there, we're now going through a cooling spell.
7600	12400	The idea that global warming has stopped, whether by the hand of a deity or some unknown
12400	16000	act of nature, is frequently asserted on the internet.
16000	19380	And it's popped up quite a bit on my channel.
19380	24240	The first thing to do when confronted with any assertion is to ask where it comes from.
24240	28220	Neither Inhofe nor any of the three posters cites a source.
28220	32360	But a number of people tell me they heard this from James Cook University paleontologist
32360	33880	Bob Carter.
33880	36020	So what's his source?
36020	41180	In April 2006, Carter published this claim in Britain's Sunday Telegraph, and it's been
41180	43420	going round the internet ever since.
43420	45780	It was even picked up by Fox News.
45780	51900	Carter notes that since 1998, average temperatures across the globe have not increased at all
51900	54660	and in fact have dropped ever so slightly.
54660	59380	I'm sure that in order to be fair and balanced, Brit Hume immediately went to a real climate
59380	63360	scientist to get the reaction of an expert to Carter's claim.
63360	65780	So let's do the same.
65780	70260	Carter claims his source is the temperature record of the UK's Climate Research Unit from
70260	73100	1998 to 2005.
73100	76620	But the CRU doesn't say that the Earth is cooling at all.
76620	78060	Quite the opposite.
78060	83360	It says its data, compiled jointly with the Hadley Centre under the title Hadcrut, shows
83360	85800	continued warming.
85800	90700	And the other two bodies that monitor global surface temperatures show even more warming.
90700	96120	NOAA's climate monitoring chief, Deke Aant, told the Associated Press, the last 10 years,
96120	102080	that's from 1998 to 2008, are the warmest 10-year period of the modern record.
102080	106640	Even if you analyse the trend during that 10 years, the trend is actually positive,
106640	108200	which means warming.
108200	113180	NASA's Goddard Institute for Space Studies says the year 2007 tied for second warmest
113180	118180	in the period of instrumental data behind the record warmth of 2005.
118180	122860	Robert Fawcett and David Jones at the National Climate Centre in Australia did an independent
122860	127780	study of the data from all three monitoring bodies and confirmed their conclusions.
127780	131980	So how come the world's three temperature monitoring organisations and an independent
131980	138380	study by experts say the world was warming at a time that Carter says it was cooling?
138380	140760	That's actually quite easy to answer.
140760	143880	Carter misunderstood how temperature trends are analysed.
143880	148800	He simply put a ruler from the highest peak he could find, 1998, and drew a line down
148800	154720	to a lower peak, 2005, and from that it would seem fairly clear that temperatures were falling.
154720	158320	But if things were that simple, we could draw a line from here to here and show that the
158320	163160	Earth was warming up, or from here to here, and have it cool down again.
163160	166120	Obviously, this isn't how it's done.
166120	170320	As I said in my video, climate change isn't it natural, there's a reason for all these
170320	171840	peaks and troughs.
171840	176080	The Earth is subject to short-term cyclical fluctuations in temperature and two of the
176080	182040	most important are the 11-year solar cycle and what's called the El Niño-Southern Oscillation.
182040	187680	Both of these phenomena, especially the Pacific Oscillation, affect the global average.
187680	192760	If we pull back from the time period Carter focused on, we can see that his starting point,
192760	199160	1998, showed an exceptional spike in global temperatures, because 1998 was an exceptionally
199200	201280	strong El Niño year.
201280	207240	Conversely, late 2007 not only saw a La Niño year, which lowered average temperatures,
207240	212440	it coincided with the bottom of the 11-year solar cycle, when solar irradiance is at its
212440	213680	weakest.
213680	217960	To smooth out these background fluctuations, climate scientists take a moving average of
217960	222760	temperatures, usually over a 5 or 10 or 11-year period.
222760	228520	That's why experts say the moving average shows the underlying trend is still upwards.
228520	231800	This isn't some devious method to show warming that isn't there.
231800	236720	All climatologists, skeptics and proponents alike, use this method.
236720	241880	It also flattens out peaks that might otherwise exaggerate the extent of warming, so it works
241880	243280	both ways.
243280	245840	And it's used in other fields of science too.
245840	250440	If Carter had submitted his hypothesis to a respected scientific journal, his mistakes
250440	253840	would have been spotted during peer review.
253840	258280	It'll be interesting to see how many people post messages saying the world must be cooling
258280	263000	now, because there was record snowfall in the eastern United States in February.
263000	268400	But of course the eastern US is not the world, which is why it's called global warming.
268400	274520	When temperatures all over the world are averaged out, figures for 2009 show another increase.
274520	278360	Let's move on to another myth that made it onto the forum of one of my videos.
278360	280640	Again, no source.
280640	284800	We simply don't know where this assertion comes from, but I have seen it copied and
284800	287040	pasted all over the internet.
287040	288640	And it's not correct.
288640	294200	A study in the late 1990s, for example, showed that Uranus was cooling.
294200	297860	In any case, if this claim is supposed to show that all the planets are being heated
297860	304040	up by increased irradiance from the Sun, that's not backed up by scientific research either.
304040	307840	We don't need to go all the way out to Pluto to measure solar irradiance.
307840	312920	We've got instruments in orbit that can do it directly, and far more accurately.
312920	317480	And they show no significant increase over the last 30 years.
317480	319280	But I agree with the second point.
319280	323800	The warming or cooling of other planets is obviously not the work of man.
323800	328120	Planets are subject to many of the same factors that influence climate on Earth.
328120	332720	According to research published in Nature, Mars is warming because dust storms have exposed
332720	335880	darker ground, which absorbs more heat.
335880	341420	Finally, this myth, also posted on my channel, is an interesting exercise in how to track
341420	346820	down, or how some people don't bother to track down, the source of a claim.
346820	351380	Fortunately, NOGUF has done something rare and given us a source, so we can have some
351380	353520	fun and track this myth down.
353520	358620	It comes from a blog by someone called Michael Andrews, who makes some astonishing claims.
358620	363340	He says NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center has produced a new study, concluding that
363340	366480	the Sun is responsible for recent climate change.
366480	371060	Evidence for climate changes based on solar radiation, the study apparently tells us,
371060	374460	can be traced back as far as the Industrial Revolution.
374460	378820	In other words, while every other major scientific body agrees with the conclusion that carbon
378820	383960	dioxide is responsible for recent warming, NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center seems to
383960	386260	be saying it's the Sun.
386260	389740	Why wasn't this headline news around the world?
389740	393900	Andrews gives us a link to the study, this time calling it a research report.
393900	398640	Well, actually, the link doesn't go to a study or a research report, but to an article on
398640	401400	another blog called Science Daily.
401400	406360	But that does lead us to the original source, a NASA article written by someone called Rani
406360	408920	Gran, and here it is.
408920	411400	Now we can start to unravel the myth.
411400	415880	The first thing we can see is that this isn't a study or a research report at all.
415880	420640	Rani Gran is a multimedia producer with NASA's Public Relations Department, and she doesn't
420640	423660	write scientific studies or research reports.
423660	427660	This is a publicity piece summarising what we already know about the role of the Sun
427700	429700	in past climate.
429700	433660	There's nothing new in this at all, which is why it sat on the internet for a year without
433660	435860	getting much attention.
435860	439820	It's not saying that climate change based on solar radiation can be traced back to the
439820	441620	Industrial Revolution.
441620	447260	Gran says the opposite, that since the Industrial Revolution, new forces have begun to exert
447260	450140	significant influence on Earth's climate.
450140	455500	And she quotes climatologists at Goddard who explained that these new influences are greenhouse
455500	457060	gases.
457060	460900	Anyone who's watched my videos on climate change will know that this kind of distortion
460900	467180	and outright fabrication is so common it's just not shocking anymore, it's not even interesting.
467180	469500	We've come to expect it.
469500	474180	What is interesting is that so many people copied and pasted Andrew's story onto other
474180	478820	blogs without bothering to look at the alleged study itself.
478820	482800	Then more people read the blogs and didn't bother to check the source either.
482800	486720	Casting scepticism aside, they were quite willing to believe that one of the foremost
486720	491640	climate institutes in the world was now blaming the Sun for recent warming.
491640	495900	So although I encourage people to post these myths on my channel, I'm more than happy to
495900	498160	follow them to their source and debunk them.
498160	500880	You could try checking the source yourself.
500880	503000	Find out where the information comes from.
503000	504600	Is the source reliable?
504600	509560	Does the information you've been given accurately reflect the information from the source?
509560	514440	As we've seen recently, even the IPCC can use bad sources.
514440	519480	That's why I try to source all the information on my videos to peer-reviewed scientific papers
519480	525680	published in reputable journals, or at least to qualified researchers and scientific institutes.
525680	531700	Not amateur blogs, not gossip from my local bar, or radio shock jocks, or Sunday newspapers,
531700	535800	or Glenn Beck or Al Gore, or even the IPCC.
535800	540080	So before you post the next Urban Myth, please check the information right back through as
540080	544500	many blogs as it takes until you come to the original source.
544500	549760	And ensure that that source is based on research and not armchair speculation.
549760	553880	And if you see a piece of information without a proper source, be sceptical.
