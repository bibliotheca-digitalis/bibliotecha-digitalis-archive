1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,120
It's not whether or not we're going through a global warming period.

2
00:00:03,120 --> 00:00:04,440
We were, we're not now.

3
00:00:04,440 --> 00:00:07,600
You know, God's still up there, we're now going through a cooling spell.

4
00:00:07,600 --> 00:00:12,400
The idea that global warming has stopped, whether by the hand of a deity or some unknown

5
00:00:12,400 --> 00:00:16,000
act of nature, is frequently asserted on the internet.

6
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:19,380
And it's popped up quite a bit on my channel.

7
00:00:19,380 --> 00:00:24,240
The first thing to do when confronted with any assertion is to ask where it comes from.

8
00:00:24,240 --> 00:00:28,220
Neither Inhofe nor any of the three posters cites a source.

9
00:00:28,220 --> 00:00:32,360
But a number of people tell me they heard this from James Cook University paleontologist

10
00:00:32,360 --> 00:00:33,880
Bob Carter.

11
00:00:33,880 --> 00:00:36,020
So what's his source?

12
00:00:36,020 --> 00:00:41,180
In April 2006, Carter published this claim in Britain's Sunday Telegraph, and it's been

13
00:00:41,180 --> 00:00:43,420
going round the internet ever since.

14
00:00:43,420 --> 00:00:45,780
It was even picked up by Fox News.

15
00:00:45,780 --> 00:00:51,900
Carter notes that since 1998, average temperatures across the globe have not increased at all

16
00:00:51,900 --> 00:00:54,660
and in fact have dropped ever so slightly.

17
00:00:54,660 --> 00:00:59,380
I'm sure that in order to be fair and balanced, Brit Hume immediately went to a real climate

18
00:00:59,380 --> 00:01:03,360
scientist to get the reaction of an expert to Carter's claim.

19
00:01:03,360 --> 00:01:05,780
So let's do the same.

20
00:01:05,780 --> 00:01:10,260
Carter claims his source is the temperature record of the UK's Climate Research Unit from

21
00:01:10,260 --> 00:01:13,100
1998 to 2005.

22
00:01:13,100 --> 00:01:16,620
But the CRU doesn't say that the Earth is cooling at all.

23
00:01:16,620 --> 00:01:18,060
Quite the opposite.

24
00:01:18,060 --> 00:01:23,360
It says its data, compiled jointly with the Hadley Centre under the title Hadcrut, shows

25
00:01:23,360 --> 00:01:25,800
continued warming.

26
00:01:25,800 --> 00:01:30,700
And the other two bodies that monitor global surface temperatures show even more warming.

27
00:01:30,700 --> 00:01:36,120
NOAA's climate monitoring chief, Deke Aant, told the Associated Press, the last 10 years,

28
00:01:36,120 --> 00:01:42,080
that's from 1998 to 2008, are the warmest 10-year period of the modern record.

29
00:01:42,080 --> 00:01:46,640
Even if you analyse the trend during that 10 years, the trend is actually positive,

30
00:01:46,640 --> 00:01:48,200
which means warming.

31
00:01:48,200 --> 00:01:53,180
NASA's Goddard Institute for Space Studies says the year 2007 tied for second warmest

32
00:01:53,180 --> 00:01:58,180
in the period of instrumental data behind the record warmth of 2005.

33
00:01:58,180 --> 00:02:02,860
Robert Fawcett and David Jones at the National Climate Centre in Australia did an independent

34
00:02:02,860 --> 00:02:07,780
study of the data from all three monitoring bodies and confirmed their conclusions.

35
00:02:07,780 --> 00:02:11,980
So how come the world's three temperature monitoring organisations and an independent

36
00:02:11,980 --> 00:02:18,380
study by experts say the world was warming at a time that Carter says it was cooling?

37
00:02:18,380 --> 00:02:20,760
That's actually quite easy to answer.

38
00:02:20,760 --> 00:02:23,880
Carter misunderstood how temperature trends are analysed.

39
00:02:23,880 --> 00:02:28,800
He simply put a ruler from the highest peak he could find, 1998, and drew a line down

40
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:34,720
to a lower peak, 2005, and from that it would seem fairly clear that temperatures were falling.

41
00:02:34,720 --> 00:02:38,320
But if things were that simple, we could draw a line from here to here and show that the

42
00:02:38,320 --> 00:02:43,160
Earth was warming up, or from here to here, and have it cool down again.

43
00:02:43,160 --> 00:02:46,120
Obviously, this isn't how it's done.

44
00:02:46,120 --> 00:02:50,320
As I said in my video, climate change isn't it natural, there's a reason for all these

45
00:02:50,320 --> 00:02:51,840
peaks and troughs.

46
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:56,080
The Earth is subject to short-term cyclical fluctuations in temperature and two of the

47
00:02:56,080 --> 00:03:02,040
most important are the 11-year solar cycle and what's called the El Niño-Southern Oscillation.

48
00:03:02,040 --> 00:03:07,680
Both of these phenomena, especially the Pacific Oscillation, affect the global average.

49
00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:12,760
If we pull back from the time period Carter focused on, we can see that his starting point,

50
00:03:12,760 --> 00:03:19,160
1998, showed an exceptional spike in global temperatures, because 1998 was an exceptionally

51
00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:21,280
strong El Niño year.

52
00:03:21,280 --> 00:03:27,240
Conversely, late 2007 not only saw a La Niño year, which lowered average temperatures,

53
00:03:27,240 --> 00:03:32,440
it coincided with the bottom of the 11-year solar cycle, when solar irradiance is at its

54
00:03:32,440 --> 00:03:33,680
weakest.

55
00:03:33,680 --> 00:03:37,960
To smooth out these background fluctuations, climate scientists take a moving average of

56
00:03:37,960 --> 00:03:42,760
temperatures, usually over a 5 or 10 or 11-year period.

57
00:03:42,760 --> 00:03:48,520
That's why experts say the moving average shows the underlying trend is still upwards.

58
00:03:48,520 --> 00:03:51,800
This isn't some devious method to show warming that isn't there.

59
00:03:51,800 --> 00:03:56,720
All climatologists, skeptics and proponents alike, use this method.

60
00:03:56,720 --> 00:04:01,880
It also flattens out peaks that might otherwise exaggerate the extent of warming, so it works

61
00:04:01,880 --> 00:04:03,280
both ways.

62
00:04:03,280 --> 00:04:05,840
And it's used in other fields of science too.

63
00:04:05,840 --> 00:04:10,440
If Carter had submitted his hypothesis to a respected scientific journal, his mistakes

64
00:04:10,440 --> 00:04:13,840
would have been spotted during peer review.

65
00:04:13,840 --> 00:04:18,280
It'll be interesting to see how many people post messages saying the world must be cooling

66
00:04:18,280 --> 00:04:23,000
now, because there was record snowfall in the eastern United States in February.

67
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:28,400
But of course the eastern US is not the world, which is why it's called global warming.

68
00:04:28,400 --> 00:04:34,520
When temperatures all over the world are averaged out, figures for 2009 show another increase.

69
00:04:34,520 --> 00:04:38,360
Let's move on to another myth that made it onto the forum of one of my videos.

70
00:04:38,360 --> 00:04:40,640
Again, no source.

71
00:04:40,640 --> 00:04:44,800
We simply don't know where this assertion comes from, but I have seen it copied and

72
00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:47,040
pasted all over the internet.

73
00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:48,640
And it's not correct.

74
00:04:48,640 --> 00:04:54,200
A study in the late 1990s, for example, showed that Uranus was cooling.

75
00:04:54,200 --> 00:04:57,860
In any case, if this claim is supposed to show that all the planets are being heated

76
00:04:57,860 --> 00:05:04,040
up by increased irradiance from the Sun, that's not backed up by scientific research either.

77
00:05:04,040 --> 00:05:07,840
We don't need to go all the way out to Pluto to measure solar irradiance.

78
00:05:07,840 --> 00:05:12,920
We've got instruments in orbit that can do it directly, and far more accurately.

79
00:05:12,920 --> 00:05:17,480
And they show no significant increase over the last 30 years.

80
00:05:17,480 --> 00:05:19,280
But I agree with the second point.

81
00:05:19,280 --> 00:05:23,800
The warming or cooling of other planets is obviously not the work of man.

82
00:05:23,800 --> 00:05:28,120
Planets are subject to many of the same factors that influence climate on Earth.

83
00:05:28,120 --> 00:05:32,720
According to research published in Nature, Mars is warming because dust storms have exposed

84
00:05:32,720 --> 00:05:35,880
darker ground, which absorbs more heat.

85
00:05:35,880 --> 00:05:41,420
Finally, this myth, also posted on my channel, is an interesting exercise in how to track

86
00:05:41,420 --> 00:05:46,820
down, or how some people don't bother to track down, the source of a claim.

87
00:05:46,820 --> 00:05:51,380
Fortunately, NOGUF has done something rare and given us a source, so we can have some

88
00:05:51,380 --> 00:05:53,520
fun and track this myth down.

89
00:05:53,520 --> 00:05:58,620
It comes from a blog by someone called Michael Andrews, who makes some astonishing claims.

90
00:05:58,620 --> 00:06:03,340
He says NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center has produced a new study, concluding that

91
00:06:03,340 --> 00:06:06,480
the Sun is responsible for recent climate change.

92
00:06:06,480 --> 00:06:11,060
Evidence for climate changes based on solar radiation, the study apparently tells us,

93
00:06:11,060 --> 00:06:14,460
can be traced back as far as the Industrial Revolution.

94
00:06:14,460 --> 00:06:18,820
In other words, while every other major scientific body agrees with the conclusion that carbon

95
00:06:18,820 --> 00:06:23,960
dioxide is responsible for recent warming, NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center seems to

96
00:06:23,960 --> 00:06:26,260
be saying it's the Sun.

97
00:06:26,260 --> 00:06:29,740
Why wasn't this headline news around the world?

98
00:06:29,740 --> 00:06:33,900
Andrews gives us a link to the study, this time calling it a research report.

99
00:06:33,900 --> 00:06:38,640
Well, actually, the link doesn't go to a study or a research report, but to an article on

100
00:06:38,640 --> 00:06:41,400
another blog called Science Daily.

101
00:06:41,400 --> 00:06:46,360
But that does lead us to the original source, a NASA article written by someone called Rani

102
00:06:46,360 --> 00:06:48,920
Gran, and here it is.

103
00:06:48,920 --> 00:06:51,400
Now we can start to unravel the myth.

104
00:06:51,400 --> 00:06:55,880
The first thing we can see is that this isn't a study or a research report at all.

105
00:06:55,880 --> 00:07:00,640
Rani Gran is a multimedia producer with NASA's Public Relations Department, and she doesn't

106
00:07:00,640 --> 00:07:03,660
write scientific studies or research reports.

107
00:07:03,660 --> 00:07:07,660
This is a publicity piece summarising what we already know about the role of the Sun

108
00:07:07,700 --> 00:07:09,700
in past climate.

109
00:07:09,700 --> 00:07:13,660
There's nothing new in this at all, which is why it sat on the internet for a year without

110
00:07:13,660 --> 00:07:15,860
getting much attention.

111
00:07:15,860 --> 00:07:19,820
It's not saying that climate change based on solar radiation can be traced back to the

112
00:07:19,820 --> 00:07:21,620
Industrial Revolution.

113
00:07:21,620 --> 00:07:27,260
Gran says the opposite, that since the Industrial Revolution, new forces have begun to exert

114
00:07:27,260 --> 00:07:30,140
significant influence on Earth's climate.

115
00:07:30,140 --> 00:07:35,500
And she quotes climatologists at Goddard who explained that these new influences are greenhouse

116
00:07:35,500 --> 00:07:37,060
gases.

117
00:07:37,060 --> 00:07:40,900
Anyone who's watched my videos on climate change will know that this kind of distortion

118
00:07:40,900 --> 00:07:47,180
and outright fabrication is so common it's just not shocking anymore, it's not even interesting.

119
00:07:47,180 --> 00:07:49,500
We've come to expect it.

120
00:07:49,500 --> 00:07:54,180
What is interesting is that so many people copied and pasted Andrew's story onto other

121
00:07:54,180 --> 00:07:58,820
blogs without bothering to look at the alleged study itself.

122
00:07:58,820 --> 00:08:02,800
Then more people read the blogs and didn't bother to check the source either.

123
00:08:02,800 --> 00:08:06,720
Casting scepticism aside, they were quite willing to believe that one of the foremost

124
00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:11,640
climate institutes in the world was now blaming the Sun for recent warming.

125
00:08:11,640 --> 00:08:15,900
So although I encourage people to post these myths on my channel, I'm more than happy to

126
00:08:15,900 --> 00:08:18,160
follow them to their source and debunk them.

127
00:08:18,160 --> 00:08:20,880
You could try checking the source yourself.

128
00:08:20,880 --> 00:08:23,000
Find out where the information comes from.

129
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:24,600
Is the source reliable?

130
00:08:24,600 --> 00:08:29,560
Does the information you've been given accurately reflect the information from the source?

131
00:08:29,560 --> 00:08:34,440
As we've seen recently, even the IPCC can use bad sources.

132
00:08:34,440 --> 00:08:39,480
That's why I try to source all the information on my videos to peer-reviewed scientific papers

133
00:08:39,480 --> 00:08:45,680
published in reputable journals, or at least to qualified researchers and scientific institutes.

134
00:08:45,680 --> 00:08:51,700
Not amateur blogs, not gossip from my local bar, or radio shock jocks, or Sunday newspapers,

135
00:08:51,700 --> 00:08:55,800
or Glenn Beck or Al Gore, or even the IPCC.

136
00:08:55,800 --> 00:09:00,080
So before you post the next Urban Myth, please check the information right back through as

137
00:09:00,080 --> 00:09:04,500
many blogs as it takes until you come to the original source.

138
00:09:04,500 --> 00:09:09,760
And ensure that that source is based on research and not armchair speculation.

139
00:09:09,760 --> 00:09:13,880
And if you see a piece of information without a proper source, be sceptical.
