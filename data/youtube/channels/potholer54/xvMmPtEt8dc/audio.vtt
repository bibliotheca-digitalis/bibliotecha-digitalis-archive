00:00.000 --> 00:03.120
It's not whether or not we're going through a global warming period.

00:03.120 --> 00:04.440
We were, we're not now.

00:04.440 --> 00:07.600
You know, God's still up there, we're now going through a cooling spell.

00:07.600 --> 00:12.400
The idea that global warming has stopped, whether by the hand of a deity or some unknown

00:12.400 --> 00:16.000
act of nature, is frequently asserted on the internet.

00:16.000 --> 00:19.380
And it's popped up quite a bit on my channel.

00:19.380 --> 00:24.240
The first thing to do when confronted with any assertion is to ask where it comes from.

00:24.240 --> 00:28.220
Neither Inhofe nor any of the three posters cites a source.

00:28.220 --> 00:32.360
But a number of people tell me they heard this from James Cook University paleontologist

00:32.360 --> 00:33.880
Bob Carter.

00:33.880 --> 00:36.020
So what's his source?

00:36.020 --> 00:41.180
In April 2006, Carter published this claim in Britain's Sunday Telegraph, and it's been

00:41.180 --> 00:43.420
going round the internet ever since.

00:43.420 --> 00:45.780
It was even picked up by Fox News.

00:45.780 --> 00:51.900
Carter notes that since 1998, average temperatures across the globe have not increased at all

00:51.900 --> 00:54.660
and in fact have dropped ever so slightly.

00:54.660 --> 00:59.380
I'm sure that in order to be fair and balanced, Brit Hume immediately went to a real climate

00:59.380 --> 01:03.360
scientist to get the reaction of an expert to Carter's claim.

01:03.360 --> 01:05.780
So let's do the same.

01:05.780 --> 01:10.260
Carter claims his source is the temperature record of the UK's Climate Research Unit from

01:10.260 --> 01:13.100
1998 to 2005.

01:13.100 --> 01:16.620
But the CRU doesn't say that the Earth is cooling at all.

01:16.620 --> 01:18.060
Quite the opposite.

01:18.060 --> 01:23.360
It says its data, compiled jointly with the Hadley Centre under the title Hadcrut, shows

01:23.360 --> 01:25.800
continued warming.

01:25.800 --> 01:30.700
And the other two bodies that monitor global surface temperatures show even more warming.

01:30.700 --> 01:36.120
NOAA's climate monitoring chief, Deke Aant, told the Associated Press, the last 10 years,

01:36.120 --> 01:42.080
that's from 1998 to 2008, are the warmest 10-year period of the modern record.

01:42.080 --> 01:46.640
Even if you analyse the trend during that 10 years, the trend is actually positive,

01:46.640 --> 01:48.200
which means warming.

01:48.200 --> 01:53.180
NASA's Goddard Institute for Space Studies says the year 2007 tied for second warmest

01:53.180 --> 01:58.180
in the period of instrumental data behind the record warmth of 2005.

01:58.180 --> 02:02.860
Robert Fawcett and David Jones at the National Climate Centre in Australia did an independent

02:02.860 --> 02:07.780
study of the data from all three monitoring bodies and confirmed their conclusions.

02:07.780 --> 02:11.980
So how come the world's three temperature monitoring organisations and an independent

02:11.980 --> 02:18.380
study by experts say the world was warming at a time that Carter says it was cooling?

02:18.380 --> 02:20.760
That's actually quite easy to answer.

02:20.760 --> 02:23.880
Carter misunderstood how temperature trends are analysed.

02:23.880 --> 02:28.800
He simply put a ruler from the highest peak he could find, 1998, and drew a line down

02:28.800 --> 02:34.720
to a lower peak, 2005, and from that it would seem fairly clear that temperatures were falling.

02:34.720 --> 02:38.320
But if things were that simple, we could draw a line from here to here and show that the

02:38.320 --> 02:43.160
Earth was warming up, or from here to here, and have it cool down again.

02:43.160 --> 02:46.120
Obviously, this isn't how it's done.

02:46.120 --> 02:50.320
As I said in my video, climate change isn't it natural, there's a reason for all these

02:50.320 --> 02:51.840
peaks and troughs.

02:51.840 --> 02:56.080
The Earth is subject to short-term cyclical fluctuations in temperature and two of the

02:56.080 --> 03:02.040
most important are the 11-year solar cycle and what's called the El Niño-Southern Oscillation.

03:02.040 --> 03:07.680
Both of these phenomena, especially the Pacific Oscillation, affect the global average.

03:07.680 --> 03:12.760
If we pull back from the time period Carter focused on, we can see that his starting point,

03:12.760 --> 03:19.160
1998, showed an exceptional spike in global temperatures, because 1998 was an exceptionally

03:19.200 --> 03:21.280
strong El Niño year.

03:21.280 --> 03:27.240
Conversely, late 2007 not only saw a La Niño year, which lowered average temperatures,

03:27.240 --> 03:32.440
it coincided with the bottom of the 11-year solar cycle, when solar irradiance is at its

03:32.440 --> 03:33.680
weakest.

03:33.680 --> 03:37.960
To smooth out these background fluctuations, climate scientists take a moving average of

03:37.960 --> 03:42.760
temperatures, usually over a 5 or 10 or 11-year period.

03:42.760 --> 03:48.520
That's why experts say the moving average shows the underlying trend is still upwards.

03:48.520 --> 03:51.800
This isn't some devious method to show warming that isn't there.

03:51.800 --> 03:56.720
All climatologists, skeptics and proponents alike, use this method.

03:56.720 --> 04:01.880
It also flattens out peaks that might otherwise exaggerate the extent of warming, so it works

04:01.880 --> 04:03.280
both ways.

04:03.280 --> 04:05.840
And it's used in other fields of science too.

04:05.840 --> 04:10.440
If Carter had submitted his hypothesis to a respected scientific journal, his mistakes

04:10.440 --> 04:13.840
would have been spotted during peer review.

04:13.840 --> 04:18.280
It'll be interesting to see how many people post messages saying the world must be cooling

04:18.280 --> 04:23.000
now, because there was record snowfall in the eastern United States in February.

04:23.000 --> 04:28.400
But of course the eastern US is not the world, which is why it's called global warming.

04:28.400 --> 04:34.520
When temperatures all over the world are averaged out, figures for 2009 show another increase.

04:34.520 --> 04:38.360
Let's move on to another myth that made it onto the forum of one of my videos.

04:38.360 --> 04:40.640
Again, no source.

04:40.640 --> 04:44.800
We simply don't know where this assertion comes from, but I have seen it copied and

04:44.800 --> 04:47.040
pasted all over the internet.

04:47.040 --> 04:48.640
And it's not correct.

04:48.640 --> 04:54.200
A study in the late 1990s, for example, showed that Uranus was cooling.

04:54.200 --> 04:57.860
In any case, if this claim is supposed to show that all the planets are being heated

04:57.860 --> 05:04.040
up by increased irradiance from the Sun, that's not backed up by scientific research either.

05:04.040 --> 05:07.840
We don't need to go all the way out to Pluto to measure solar irradiance.

05:07.840 --> 05:12.920
We've got instruments in orbit that can do it directly, and far more accurately.

05:12.920 --> 05:17.480
And they show no significant increase over the last 30 years.

05:17.480 --> 05:19.280
But I agree with the second point.

05:19.280 --> 05:23.800
The warming or cooling of other planets is obviously not the work of man.

05:23.800 --> 05:28.120
Planets are subject to many of the same factors that influence climate on Earth.

05:28.120 --> 05:32.720
According to research published in Nature, Mars is warming because dust storms have exposed

05:32.720 --> 05:35.880
darker ground, which absorbs more heat.

05:35.880 --> 05:41.420
Finally, this myth, also posted on my channel, is an interesting exercise in how to track

05:41.420 --> 05:46.820
down, or how some people don't bother to track down, the source of a claim.

05:46.820 --> 05:51.380
Fortunately, NOGUF has done something rare and given us a source, so we can have some

05:51.380 --> 05:53.520
fun and track this myth down.

05:53.520 --> 05:58.620
It comes from a blog by someone called Michael Andrews, who makes some astonishing claims.

05:58.620 --> 06:03.340
He says NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center has produced a new study, concluding that

06:03.340 --> 06:06.480
the Sun is responsible for recent climate change.

06:06.480 --> 06:11.060
Evidence for climate changes based on solar radiation, the study apparently tells us,

06:11.060 --> 06:14.460
can be traced back as far as the Industrial Revolution.

06:14.460 --> 06:18.820
In other words, while every other major scientific body agrees with the conclusion that carbon

06:18.820 --> 06:23.960
dioxide is responsible for recent warming, NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center seems to

06:23.960 --> 06:26.260
be saying it's the Sun.

06:26.260 --> 06:29.740
Why wasn't this headline news around the world?

06:29.740 --> 06:33.900
Andrews gives us a link to the study, this time calling it a research report.

06:33.900 --> 06:38.640
Well, actually, the link doesn't go to a study or a research report, but to an article on

06:38.640 --> 06:41.400
another blog called Science Daily.

06:41.400 --> 06:46.360
But that does lead us to the original source, a NASA article written by someone called Rani

06:46.360 --> 06:48.920
Gran, and here it is.

06:48.920 --> 06:51.400
Now we can start to unravel the myth.

06:51.400 --> 06:55.880
The first thing we can see is that this isn't a study or a research report at all.

06:55.880 --> 07:00.640
Rani Gran is a multimedia producer with NASA's Public Relations Department, and she doesn't

07:00.640 --> 07:03.660
write scientific studies or research reports.

07:03.660 --> 07:07.660
This is a publicity piece summarising what we already know about the role of the Sun

07:07.700 --> 07:09.700
in past climate.

07:09.700 --> 07:13.660
There's nothing new in this at all, which is why it sat on the internet for a year without

07:13.660 --> 07:15.860
getting much attention.

07:15.860 --> 07:19.820
It's not saying that climate change based on solar radiation can be traced back to the

07:19.820 --> 07:21.620
Industrial Revolution.

07:21.620 --> 07:27.260
Gran says the opposite, that since the Industrial Revolution, new forces have begun to exert

07:27.260 --> 07:30.140
significant influence on Earth's climate.

07:30.140 --> 07:35.500
And she quotes climatologists at Goddard who explained that these new influences are greenhouse

07:35.500 --> 07:37.060
gases.

07:37.060 --> 07:40.900
Anyone who's watched my videos on climate change will know that this kind of distortion

07:40.900 --> 07:47.180
and outright fabrication is so common it's just not shocking anymore, it's not even interesting.

07:47.180 --> 07:49.500
We've come to expect it.

07:49.500 --> 07:54.180
What is interesting is that so many people copied and pasted Andrew's story onto other

07:54.180 --> 07:58.820
blogs without bothering to look at the alleged study itself.

07:58.820 --> 08:02.800
Then more people read the blogs and didn't bother to check the source either.

08:02.800 --> 08:06.720
Casting scepticism aside, they were quite willing to believe that one of the foremost

08:06.720 --> 08:11.640
climate institutes in the world was now blaming the Sun for recent warming.

08:11.640 --> 08:15.900
So although I encourage people to post these myths on my channel, I'm more than happy to

08:15.900 --> 08:18.160
follow them to their source and debunk them.

08:18.160 --> 08:20.880
You could try checking the source yourself.

08:20.880 --> 08:23.000
Find out where the information comes from.

08:23.000 --> 08:24.600
Is the source reliable?

08:24.600 --> 08:29.560
Does the information you've been given accurately reflect the information from the source?

08:29.560 --> 08:34.440
As we've seen recently, even the IPCC can use bad sources.

08:34.440 --> 08:39.480
That's why I try to source all the information on my videos to peer-reviewed scientific papers

08:39.480 --> 08:45.680
published in reputable journals, or at least to qualified researchers and scientific institutes.

08:45.680 --> 08:51.700
Not amateur blogs, not gossip from my local bar, or radio shock jocks, or Sunday newspapers,

08:51.700 --> 08:55.800
or Glenn Beck or Al Gore, or even the IPCC.

08:55.800 --> 09:00.080
So before you post the next Urban Myth, please check the information right back through as

09:00.080 --> 09:04.500
many blogs as it takes until you come to the original source.

09:04.500 --> 09:09.760
And ensure that that source is based on research and not armchair speculation.

09:09.760 --> 09:13.880
And if you see a piece of information without a proper source, be sceptical.
