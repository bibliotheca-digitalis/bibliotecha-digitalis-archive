0	7000	Welcome to the 5th annual Golden Crocoduck Awards!
7000	17000	Yes, a hearty welcome to the 2013 Golden Crocoduck Award, brought to you from the beautiful St Jude Thaddeus Theatre in downtown Burbank.
17000	24000	As you know, the Golden Crocoduck is awarded every year for the biggest breach of the 9th Commandment in pursuit of the creationist cause.
24000	29000	And if you don't know what the 9th Commandment is, then you weren't paying attention in Sunday School.
29000	33000	It's the Biblical law that forbids the bearing of false witness.
33000	43000	And the reason it's bestowed on creationists is because it's ironic that they're willing to make false statements in order to promote a religion that forbids the making of false statements,
43000	48000	including false statements that promote a religion that forbids the making of false statements.
48000	50000	Get the irony?
50000	58000	OK, not everyone does, but I think the rest of us find these false utterances almost as funny as gay preachers railing against homosexuality.
58000	64000	Before we get onto the main agenda, please stay to the end because I have an important announcement.
64000	68000	So who has won this year's coveted Golden Crocoduck?
68000	74000	We whittled down all the nominations to five worthy contenders, whom you saw in the last video.
74000	78000	So without further ado, here in reverse order are the scores.
88000	91000	We got it.
118000	126000	Congratulations, Louis.
126000	130000	Of course, Louis is no stranger to the Golden Crocoduck award.
130000	137000	He was nominated in 2011 for his insistence that a protein called laminin was in the perfect shape of a cross.
137000	145000	And this year he won for insisting that dead stars can decide to start spinning and that sound travels through the vacuum of space.
145000	154000	If you sense a pattern here, well, that's Giglio's stock in trade, to detect signs of Jesus in just about everything he sees and hears.
154000	162000	Yes, I know it's nothing new for creationists to look at a daffodil or a sunset and babble on about how they see in it the work of the Lord,
162000	165000	but Giglio takes this to a literal extreme.
165000	176000	He thinks God has actively planted these symbols and that in the sounds they make, animate and inanimate objects are in fact seriously attempting to sing praises to God.
176000	185000	And you have to wonder, does Giglio just sit at a computer for hours googling images just to find something that vaguely resembles a cross?
185000	189000	Don't laugh. That's exactly what he does.
189000	197000	Well, while I was in Durango with these students, I was just looking for something that I hadn't seen before. I was on the Hubble site searching Whirlpool images.
197000	201000	You remember the darling of astronomy, the Whirlpool galaxy.
201000	211000	And I just searched Whirlpool. A list of names of images came up. One of them was called the X structure at the core of the Whirlpool galaxy.
212000	220000	I thought, OK, I click on that link and a photograph comes up, an image comes up on my computer screen, almost knocks me off of my seat.
220000	225000	I cannot believe it. I'm just staring at it with my mouth open. It's 31 million light years away.
225000	235000	The Hubble Space Telescope, seeing what we cannot see, has looked into the dark black hole core of the Whirlpool galaxy and sent us back a photograph.
235000	245000	Here's what NASA sent us back from 31 million light years away, deep in the core of the Whirlpool galaxy. We get this image coming back to us.
248000	254000	What is it? Well, what we're seeing are two rings of dust orbiting a black hole in the middle of the galaxy.
254000	261000	And they look black because they're blocking light. And because we're seeing the rings end on, they don't look like rings.
261000	268000	So nothing exemplifies the difference between creationists and the rest of us than how we view discoveries like this.
268000	277000	To the scientists who made this discovery and to anyone interested in learning about the fascinating universe we live in, this image is a breakthrough.
277000	285000	It's the first direct view of a ring of dust fueling a massive black hole, an event predicted by theoretical physics.
285000	295000	In a huge galaxy, millions of light years from Earth, two rings of dust a hundred times the diameter of our solar system are swirling around a black hole.
295000	304000	Hot ionised gas from the rings moving at speeds of up to 2 million miles an hour is being swallowed up into gravitational oblivion.
304000	307000	And what does a creationist see?
307000	316000	Ooh, looks just like Jesus. And that looks like Jesus. And that looks like Jesus. And ooh, that looks a lot like Jesus.
316000	321000	And of course it's not just the sights that get Louis excited, it's also the sounds.
321000	328000	We've already seen how he believes a distant pulsar is singing praises to God, and so is every other grunt and rattle.
328000	330000	What, even this?
330000	335000	Now surely there's no way Giglio can insist that this is a hymn to God.
335000	341000	You know, the whales, one of the main ways they get around is through the whale songs that they sing.
341000	347000	And I got Psalm 148 all inside of me, and I'm like, no kidding, I'm sure they do.
353000	364000	So yes, all those squawks, chirrups, bubbles, bellows and moans aren't mating calls or territorial warnings, as biologists would have us believe they're animal attempts to sing hymns.
364000	372000	Not for that god, or that god, or those gods, but only for Louis Giglio's god. The other gods will have to get their own set of animals.
372000	379000	So bearer of false witness, revealer of truth, mentally unhinged delusionist, we report you decide.
379000	385000	But for the claims that were nominated for this year's Golden Crocoduck at least, Louis Giglio got it wrong.
385000	391000	Congratulations Louis, you're the latest in a proud line of Golden Crocoduck winners.
391000	395000	And sadly, the last, because that's the announcement I have to make.
395000	402000	The Golden Crocoduck has been running since 2008, and my intention was always to keep it running as long as it was popular.
402000	408000	And it's been getting more and more popular every year, because every year the number of votes has been increasing.
408000	410000	Even creationists are talking about it.
410000	415000	But from November 2013, I'm going to have a change of lifestyle.
415000	420000	With an increasing workload, I'm going to be doing more travel and more feature stories for radio.
420000	426000	I just won't have the time to commit to the Golden Crocoduck, which involves ploughing through hours of videos,
426000	430000	and then working to the deadline of voting time and announcing the winner.
430000	433000	Most of the time I just won't physically be here.
433000	439000	It also means my self-imposed target of producing one video a month won't be realised either.
439000	444000	Each video requires an awful lot of research and meticulous indexing of my sources.
444000	450000	This isn't a channel where I just spout my opinion and blandly give you the first thing that pops into my head.
450000	458000	Believe it or not, I actually have to check all the facts and source everything from peer-reviewed papers published in respected scientific journals.
458000	462000	I don't just read something on a blog, believe it and regurgitate it.
462000	467000	On the contrary, that is exactly the kind of stuff I spend most of my time debunking.
467000	473000	I've got several videos in the pipeline, and I hope to post at least two before next April,
473000	476000	including this year's winner of The Prestigious Cock.
476000	480000	After that, I'll be busy with other things until at least October.
480000	486000	It also means I won't be able to read or respond to personal messages or questions on my channel forum,
486000	488000	which I've always done in the past.
488000	493000	It takes about an hour every day to read through the correspondence and reply to questions.
493000	497000	The only exception will be if you want to bring an error to my attention,
497000	502000	in which case please mark the message error and it will get my attention.
502000	506000	One thing I want to continue to do is correct any errors you find in my videos.
506000	516000	But please, if the conclusions I report from the scientific literature are not in accordance with a blog or a religious text or whatever else you happen to believe in,
516000	519000	that doesn't constitute an error on my part.
519000	525000	You may disagree with the theory of plate tectonics or the theory of evolution or greenhouse theory,
525000	532000	and you may disagree with the scientific conclusions in the papers that I presented, and you're welcome to your beliefs.
532000	539000	But don't expect me to change my reporting at scientific conclusions simply because it doesn't concur with your beliefs.
539000	549000	And please stay subscribed. It doesn't cost you anything and you won't be bothered or spammed until the next Pothola54 video pops up, whenever that might be.
550000	555000	Thanks to all those who've been watching, all those who subscribe, and all those who sent messages.
555000	561000	I read them all and if I didn't reply it was only because there wasn't a question in there to reply to.
561000	565000	Now I don't want to sound like a guru, but if I've achieved anything in my videos,
565000	570000	it isn't to show you what the science says in opposition to the bloggers, preachers, and politicians.
570000	575000	It's to show the importance of checking what the bloggers, preachers, and politicians say.
575000	580000	You don't need me to debunk this junk science because you know how to do it.
580000	584000	Ask how do you know? Ask for a source.
584000	590000	And then check the source, trace it right back to where the information came from, and compare it with the claim.
590000	595000	And do it nicely. That drives the junk scientist mad.
