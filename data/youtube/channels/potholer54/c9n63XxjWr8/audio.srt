00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,000
Welcome to the 5th annual Golden Crocoduck Awards!

2
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:17,000
Yes, a hearty welcome to the 2013 Golden Crocoduck Award, brought to you from the beautiful St Jude Thaddeus Theatre in downtown Burbank.

3
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:24,000
As you know, the Golden Crocoduck is awarded every year for the biggest breach of the 9th Commandment in pursuit of the creationist cause.

4
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:29,000
And if you don't know what the 9th Commandment is, then you weren't paying attention in Sunday School.

5
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:33,000
It's the Biblical law that forbids the bearing of false witness.

6
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:43,000
And the reason it's bestowed on creationists is because it's ironic that they're willing to make false statements in order to promote a religion that forbids the making of false statements,

7
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:48,000
including false statements that promote a religion that forbids the making of false statements.

8
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,000
Get the irony?

9
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:58,000
OK, not everyone does, but I think the rest of us find these false utterances almost as funny as gay preachers railing against homosexuality.

10
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:04,000
Before we get onto the main agenda, please stay to the end because I have an important announcement.

11
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:08,000
So who has won this year's coveted Golden Crocoduck?

12
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:14,000
We whittled down all the nominations to five worthy contenders, whom you saw in the last video.

13
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:18,000
So without further ado, here in reverse order are the scores.

14
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:31,000
We got it.

15
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:06,000
Congratulations, Louis.

16
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:10,000
Of course, Louis is no stranger to the Golden Crocoduck award.

17
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:17,000
He was nominated in 2011 for his insistence that a protein called laminin was in the perfect shape of a cross.

18
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:25,000
And this year he won for insisting that dead stars can decide to start spinning and that sound travels through the vacuum of space.

19
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:34,000
If you sense a pattern here, well, that's Giglio's stock in trade, to detect signs of Jesus in just about everything he sees and hears.

20
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:42,000
Yes, I know it's nothing new for creationists to look at a daffodil or a sunset and babble on about how they see in it the work of the Lord,

21
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:45,000
but Giglio takes this to a literal extreme.

22
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:56,000
He thinks God has actively planted these symbols and that in the sounds they make, animate and inanimate objects are in fact seriously attempting to sing praises to God.

23
00:02:56,000 --> 00:03:05,000
And you have to wonder, does Giglio just sit at a computer for hours googling images just to find something that vaguely resembles a cross?

24
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:09,000
Don't laugh. That's exactly what he does.

25
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:17,000
Well, while I was in Durango with these students, I was just looking for something that I hadn't seen before. I was on the Hubble site searching Whirlpool images.

26
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:21,000
You remember the darling of astronomy, the Whirlpool galaxy.

27
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:31,000
And I just searched Whirlpool. A list of names of images came up. One of them was called the X structure at the core of the Whirlpool galaxy.

28
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:40,000
I thought, OK, I click on that link and a photograph comes up, an image comes up on my computer screen, almost knocks me off of my seat.

29
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:45,000
I cannot believe it. I'm just staring at it with my mouth open. It's 31 million light years away.

30
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:55,000
The Hubble Space Telescope, seeing what we cannot see, has looked into the dark black hole core of the Whirlpool galaxy and sent us back a photograph.

31
00:03:55,000 --> 00:04:05,000
Here's what NASA sent us back from 31 million light years away, deep in the core of the Whirlpool galaxy. We get this image coming back to us.

32
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:14,000
What is it? Well, what we're seeing are two rings of dust orbiting a black hole in the middle of the galaxy.

33
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:21,000
And they look black because they're blocking light. And because we're seeing the rings end on, they don't look like rings.

34
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:28,000
So nothing exemplifies the difference between creationists and the rest of us than how we view discoveries like this.

35
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:37,000
To the scientists who made this discovery and to anyone interested in learning about the fascinating universe we live in, this image is a breakthrough.

36
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:45,000
It's the first direct view of a ring of dust fueling a massive black hole, an event predicted by theoretical physics.

37
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:55,000
In a huge galaxy, millions of light years from Earth, two rings of dust a hundred times the diameter of our solar system are swirling around a black hole.

38
00:04:55,000 --> 00:05:04,000
Hot ionised gas from the rings moving at speeds of up to 2 million miles an hour is being swallowed up into gravitational oblivion.

39
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:07,000
And what does a creationist see?

40
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:16,000
Ooh, looks just like Jesus. And that looks like Jesus. And that looks like Jesus. And ooh, that looks a lot like Jesus.

41
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:21,000
And of course it's not just the sights that get Louis excited, it's also the sounds.

42
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:28,000
We've already seen how he believes a distant pulsar is singing praises to God, and so is every other grunt and rattle.

43
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:30,000
What, even this?

44
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:35,000
Now surely there's no way Giglio can insist that this is a hymn to God.

45
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:41,000
You know, the whales, one of the main ways they get around is through the whale songs that they sing.

46
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:47,000
And I got Psalm 148 all inside of me, and I'm like, no kidding, I'm sure they do.

47
00:05:53,000 --> 00:06:04,000
So yes, all those squawks, chirrups, bubbles, bellows and moans aren't mating calls or territorial warnings, as biologists would have us believe they're animal attempts to sing hymns.

48
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:12,000
Not for that god, or that god, or those gods, but only for Louis Giglio's god. The other gods will have to get their own set of animals.

49
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:19,000
So bearer of false witness, revealer of truth, mentally unhinged delusionist, we report you decide.

50
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:25,000
But for the claims that were nominated for this year's Golden Crocoduck at least, Louis Giglio got it wrong.

51
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:31,000
Congratulations Louis, you're the latest in a proud line of Golden Crocoduck winners.

52
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:35,000
And sadly, the last, because that's the announcement I have to make.

53
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:42,000
The Golden Crocoduck has been running since 2008, and my intention was always to keep it running as long as it was popular.

54
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:48,000
And it's been getting more and more popular every year, because every year the number of votes has been increasing.

55
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:50,000
Even creationists are talking about it.

56
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:55,000
But from November 2013, I'm going to have a change of lifestyle.

57
00:06:55,000 --> 00:07:00,000
With an increasing workload, I'm going to be doing more travel and more feature stories for radio.

58
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:06,000
I just won't have the time to commit to the Golden Crocoduck, which involves ploughing through hours of videos,

59
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:10,000
and then working to the deadline of voting time and announcing the winner.

60
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:13,000
Most of the time I just won't physically be here.

61
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:19,000
It also means my self-imposed target of producing one video a month won't be realised either.

62
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:24,000
Each video requires an awful lot of research and meticulous indexing of my sources.

63
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:30,000
This isn't a channel where I just spout my opinion and blandly give you the first thing that pops into my head.

64
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:38,000
Believe it or not, I actually have to check all the facts and source everything from peer-reviewed papers published in respected scientific journals.

65
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:42,000
I don't just read something on a blog, believe it and regurgitate it.

66
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:47,000
On the contrary, that is exactly the kind of stuff I spend most of my time debunking.

67
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:53,000
I've got several videos in the pipeline, and I hope to post at least two before next April,

68
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:56,000
including this year's winner of The Prestigious Cock.

69
00:07:56,000 --> 00:08:00,000
After that, I'll be busy with other things until at least October.

70
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:06,000
It also means I won't be able to read or respond to personal messages or questions on my channel forum,

71
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:08,000
which I've always done in the past.

72
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:13,000
It takes about an hour every day to read through the correspondence and reply to questions.

73
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:17,000
The only exception will be if you want to bring an error to my attention,

74
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:22,000
in which case please mark the message error and it will get my attention.

75
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:26,000
One thing I want to continue to do is correct any errors you find in my videos.

76
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:36,000
But please, if the conclusions I report from the scientific literature are not in accordance with a blog or a religious text or whatever else you happen to believe in,

77
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:39,000
that doesn't constitute an error on my part.

78
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:45,000
You may disagree with the theory of plate tectonics or the theory of evolution or greenhouse theory,

79
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:52,000
and you may disagree with the scientific conclusions in the papers that I presented, and you're welcome to your beliefs.

80
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:59,000
But don't expect me to change my reporting at scientific conclusions simply because it doesn't concur with your beliefs.

81
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:09,000
And please stay subscribed. It doesn't cost you anything and you won't be bothered or spammed until the next Pothola54 video pops up, whenever that might be.

82
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:15,000
Thanks to all those who've been watching, all those who subscribe, and all those who sent messages.

83
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:21,000
I read them all and if I didn't reply it was only because there wasn't a question in there to reply to.

84
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:25,000
Now I don't want to sound like a guru, but if I've achieved anything in my videos,

85
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:30,000
it isn't to show you what the science says in opposition to the bloggers, preachers, and politicians.

86
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:35,000
It's to show the importance of checking what the bloggers, preachers, and politicians say.

87
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:40,000
You don't need me to debunk this junk science because you know how to do it.

88
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:44,000
Ask how do you know? Ask for a source.

89
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:50,000
And then check the source, trace it right back to where the information came from, and compare it with the claim.

90
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:55,000
And do it nicely. That drives the junk scientist mad.
