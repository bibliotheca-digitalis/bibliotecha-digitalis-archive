00:00.000 --> 00:14.520
So now we come to the question of what the consequences of climate change will be.

00:14.520 --> 00:20.040
I think we can safely say that the oceans won't boil and we won't all drown, and neither

00:20.040 --> 00:23.520
will the Earth blow up, as this blog claims.

00:23.520 --> 00:28.040
Of course it's possible under the principle that anything is possible, but these are claims

00:28.040 --> 00:33.200
that aren't supported by the scientific literature, even when they're made in blogs dressed up

00:33.200 --> 00:35.940
to look like scientific papers.

00:35.940 --> 00:40.520
So let's leave aside the controversy and the speculation, and simply look at what will

00:40.520 --> 00:46.720
happen according to scientific research published in respected peer-reviewed journals.

00:46.720 --> 00:50.800
The first and most obvious consequence is that warmer temperatures will cause ice caps

00:50.800 --> 00:54.760
to melt, and this melt will cause sea levels to rise.

00:54.760 --> 00:59.920
We can see how this has happened in the past, most recently at the end of the last glaciation,

00:59.920 --> 01:03.040
when sea levels rose about 200 feet.

01:03.040 --> 01:07.660
Now it's hard to argue that melting ice won't cause sea levels to rise, so the only way

01:07.660 --> 01:14.200
to get around the rising sea levels problem is to try to argue that the ice isn't melting.

01:14.200 --> 01:18.080
You've seen those headlines about global warming.

01:18.080 --> 01:19.920
The glaciers are melting.

01:19.920 --> 01:22.520
We're doomed.

01:22.520 --> 01:25.840
That's what several studies supposedly found.

01:25.840 --> 01:29.840
But other scientific studies found exactly the opposite.

01:29.840 --> 01:32.400
Greenland's glaciers are growing, not melting.

01:32.400 --> 01:35.780
No, no scientific study has found that.

01:35.780 --> 01:40.880
Not even the paper cited in this video by the Competitive Enterprise Institute.

01:40.880 --> 01:45.700
It's the same paper cited by Monckton to make exactly the same claim.

01:45.700 --> 01:50.120
And just like Monckton, the makers of the video didn't actually read the paper before

01:50.120 --> 01:53.040
jumping to their conclusion.

01:53.040 --> 01:58.160
The research paper only looked at the interior of Greenland at higher altitude.

01:58.160 --> 02:02.600
And the author, Johannesson, specifically warns against drawing the conclusion that

02:02.600 --> 02:07.180
there's no net melting, based only on the limited scope of the study.

02:07.180 --> 02:12.020
Because of course ice is melting, or more technically, ablating from the lower altitude

02:12.020 --> 02:18.160
coastal areas of Greenland, and it's melting much faster than it's accumulating.

02:18.160 --> 02:23.680
A regular on my channel, 1000 Frolley, accepts that there's a net loss of ice from Greenland,

02:23.680 --> 02:27.000
but says it's made up for by ice gain in Antarctica.

02:27.000 --> 02:32.980
And he cites a source, a blog by William Robert Johnson, who gives us the benefit of his expertise

02:32.980 --> 02:38.560
on everything from abortion to Daedalus-class starships used in Star Trek.

02:38.560 --> 02:43.320
It's impossible to know how Johnson derived his figures, but it doesn't matter.

02:43.320 --> 02:47.960
The fact that his figures start 15 years before there was any measurable warming of the atmosphere

02:48.400 --> 02:52.980
and long before there was any serious attempt at measuring the ice loss, and they end five

02:52.980 --> 02:58.040
years before Frolley thinks they do, and they're based on Johnson's own extrapolation of what

02:58.040 --> 03:04.000
he admits is a limited amount of data going back that far, and that Johnson himself emphasises

03:04.000 --> 03:08.960
that these figures should only be regarded as illustrative, explains why it's never a

03:08.960 --> 03:14.880
good idea to quote the conclusions of a blogger as if they were proper scientific research.

03:14.880 --> 03:19.800
If you want to play scientist, you have to actually read the scientific literature and

03:19.800 --> 03:21.640
quote that.

03:21.640 --> 03:24.440
So what does the scientific literature say?

03:24.440 --> 03:29.600
Well, just as in the highlands of Greenland, researchers have determined that ice is growing

03:29.600 --> 03:35.320
in areas like East Antarctica and high altitude glaciers, probably, they say, because warmer

03:35.320 --> 03:39.560
air is able to hold more moisture, and that means more snow.

03:39.560 --> 03:44.360
And in West Antarctica, the coastal areas of Greenland and lower glaciers, the ice is

03:44.360 --> 03:45.540
melting.

03:45.540 --> 03:50.800
As in Greenland, the question is, is the amount of cap ice melting worldwide greater than

03:50.800 --> 03:52.800
the amount accumulating?

03:52.800 --> 03:58.520
And the answer, based on these measurements rather than the blogs, is yes, by about 4.3

03:58.520 --> 04:04.860
trillion tonnes in seven years, or about 150 cubic miles a year.

04:04.860 --> 04:09.740
Before I move on, a quick word from those who exaggerate the effects of global warming.

04:09.740 --> 04:15.140
According to Global Warming Siren, polar ice caps could vanish within five years.

04:15.140 --> 04:17.740
And that was back in 2010.

04:17.740 --> 04:18.740
The source?

04:18.740 --> 04:20.180
Hal Gore.

04:20.180 --> 04:23.540
As always, we need to check the primary source.

04:23.540 --> 04:27.860
Gore bases his claim on a study by Wieslaw Maslowski.

04:27.860 --> 04:32.500
What Gore didn't mention was that most studies disagree with this conclusion.

04:32.500 --> 04:38.740
They predict an ice-free North Pole is several decades away, as Maslowski himself acknowledges.

04:38.740 --> 04:44.220
So the same message goes out to the climate exaggerators, stop quoting blogs and politicians

04:44.220 --> 04:48.460
and start reading the scientific literature if you're going to take it upon yourselves

04:48.460 --> 04:51.180
to report on climate change.

04:51.180 --> 04:56.140
By the way, melting sea ice makes no difference to sea levels because the ice is already in

04:56.140 --> 04:57.760
the sea.

04:57.760 --> 05:00.900
It's cap ice that makes the difference.

05:00.900 --> 05:06.620
With 150 cubic miles of this ice melting every year, basic physics tells us that this

05:06.620 --> 05:09.200
will cause sea levels to rise.

05:09.200 --> 05:14.820
And basic physics also tells us that as water warms up, it expands, so on top of the rise

05:14.820 --> 05:21.300
due to ice melt, researchers say sea levels will also rise because of thermal expansion.

05:21.300 --> 05:23.600
There are two ways to calculate this.

05:23.600 --> 05:27.860
One is to estimate how much ice will melt and how much the oceans will expand for a

05:27.860 --> 05:32.940
given rise in temperature, and that gives us a figure of between 0.8 and 2 metres by

05:32.940 --> 05:38.120
the end of the century, depending on how much CO2 is pumped into the atmosphere.

05:38.120 --> 05:42.940
Another way of estimating it is to see how much sea levels rose in the past for a given

05:42.940 --> 05:48.420
rise in temperature, and that gives a similar range between 1 and 2 metres by the end of

05:48.420 --> 05:49.420
this century.

05:49.420 --> 05:54.500
0.8 metres, the low end of the estimates, may not sound like much.

05:54.500 --> 05:56.300
It's about 3 feet.

05:56.300 --> 06:00.960
But it's enough to submerge large areas of coastline, including parts of coastal cities

06:00.960 --> 06:07.660
like Miami, Guangzhou, New York and Calcutta, and Tokyo, Hong Kong, Bangkok, New Orleans,

06:07.660 --> 06:09.460
Amsterdam and Rotterdam.

06:09.460 --> 06:14.860
2 metres, the high end of the scale, is over 6 feet.

06:14.860 --> 06:17.280
Still the urban myths persist.

06:17.280 --> 06:22.360
And who better to demonstrate them than our old friend 1000 Frolley, who calls my reporting

06:22.360 --> 06:25.660
on sea level rise misleading tosh.

06:25.660 --> 06:31.700
Cottie's claim of a 100 centimetre rise, that's a metre, by 2100 is pure fiction, based

06:31.700 --> 06:34.740
on IPCC alarmism.

06:34.740 --> 06:37.040
Well first of all, of course, this isn't my claim.

06:37.040 --> 06:41.380
I'm just doing what I always do in my videos, which is to report what's published in the

06:41.380 --> 06:43.260
scientific literature.

06:43.260 --> 06:47.440
Secondly, I don't use the IPCC as a source.

06:47.440 --> 06:52.860
My sources are either listed in the video description or the videos themselves.

06:52.860 --> 06:58.420
So this can only be misleading tosh if I've misreported the papers, which apparently I

06:58.420 --> 07:04.220
haven't, or if other research rebuts it, which Frolley seems to think it does.

07:04.220 --> 07:09.860
He cites a paper by Lilliet and Nerem at the University of Colorado, which has a unit dedicated

07:09.860 --> 07:11.960
to sea level change.

07:11.960 --> 07:16.180
The quote shows that if you look at sea level changes, which have been rising for the past

07:16.180 --> 07:21.900
20 years according to this graph by the University of Colorado, and then pick out carefully selected

07:21.940 --> 07:27.140
years, it appears as though future sea level increases are in decline.

07:27.140 --> 07:32.340
It's such a convoluted, cherry-picked and weird way of doing science, I was astonished

07:32.340 --> 07:38.060
that respected researchers like Nerem and Lilliet would write anything so ridiculous.

07:38.060 --> 07:39.620
And of course they didn't.

07:39.620 --> 07:45.900
The conclusion and the quote come, no surprise, from the blogosphere, in this case a website

07:45.900 --> 07:52.420
called Climate for You, run by the political lobby group Committee for a Constructive Tomorrow.

07:52.420 --> 07:58.020
And even Climate for You agrees that deriving figures in this weird and convoluted way is

07:58.020 --> 07:59.800
not realistic.

07:59.800 --> 08:05.500
The real forecast by the University of Colorado is the one Frolley said was tosh and misleading

08:05.500 --> 08:09.020
nonsense, 0.8 to 2 metres.

08:09.020 --> 08:13.740
Once again it illustrates the danger of trusting a blogger to tell you what's in the scientific

08:13.740 --> 08:15.940
literature.

08:15.940 --> 08:18.140
But let's go on to some good news.

08:18.140 --> 08:23.780
More CO2 is definitely good for plant growth because plants depend on carbon dioxide for

08:23.780 --> 08:25.700
photosynthesis.

08:25.700 --> 08:30.620
Experiments have shown that plants grow much better in higher concentrations of CO2, which

08:30.620 --> 08:34.380
is why nurseries often pump CO2 into greenhouses.

08:34.380 --> 08:39.660
Higher CO2 also allows plants to open their pores less widely, which means they won't

08:39.660 --> 08:43.220
lose so much water to evapotranspiration.

08:43.220 --> 08:47.220
And in higher latitudes, plants grow faster in warmer temperatures.

08:47.220 --> 08:52.820
According to the Daily Mail, global warming would boost Britain's farm crops by 10%.

08:52.820 --> 08:54.660
What's the Mail's source?

08:54.660 --> 08:59.060
Well it's quoting a study by the Met Office, Britain's meteorological office, which found

08:59.060 --> 09:03.780
that seasonal frosts would start later and finish earlier, and that's definitely good

09:03.780 --> 09:05.300
for plant growth.

09:05.300 --> 09:09.780
Trouble is, other predictions in the same Met Office report look a bit grimmer, like

09:09.780 --> 09:12.780
water shortages, flooding and heat stress.

09:12.780 --> 09:17.380
And it turns out that crop losses due to these other factors more than offset the gains

09:17.380 --> 09:21.420
illustrated in the Mail headline because of warmer temperatures.

09:21.420 --> 09:26.340
The Mail does report these negative effects, but further down in the story.

09:26.340 --> 09:32.540
Yes, some things like increased CO2 and fewer frosts will boost crop production.

09:32.540 --> 09:37.220
Other things like more frequent drought, stronger hurricanes, rising sea levels, heat stress,

09:37.220 --> 09:40.700
salination and increased flooding will reduce it.

09:40.700 --> 09:44.740
And it's the drought and the flooding that have the experts concerned.

09:44.740 --> 09:46.880
So let's look at that.

09:46.880 --> 09:52.660
As I said, higher temperatures mean the air can hold more water vapour, about 7.5% more

09:52.660 --> 09:55.320
for every degree centigrade rise.

09:55.320 --> 09:58.140
So you'd think that would cause more rainfall.

09:58.140 --> 10:02.740
Well yes it will, say climatologists, but only in certain areas.

10:02.740 --> 10:04.360
Here's why.

10:04.360 --> 10:09.100
As the world gets warmer, the extreme latitudes warm faster than lower latitudes.

10:09.100 --> 10:14.020
As a result, global air circulation will slow down because it's the difference in temperature

10:14.020 --> 10:15.680
that drives winds.

10:15.680 --> 10:20.300
The problem is, even rainfall relies on the circulation of humid air.

10:20.300 --> 10:25.220
If the circulation slows down, then air masses will tend to stay put.

10:25.220 --> 10:31.160
As a rule of thumb, dry regions will get drier, and wet regions will get wetter.

10:31.160 --> 10:35.540
To see what that'll look like, the Met Office combined a number of studies from different

10:35.540 --> 10:36.540
countries.

10:36.540 --> 10:40.980
There's Britain getting much wetter in the winter, but drier in the summer in the south

10:40.980 --> 10:42.700
of England.

10:42.700 --> 10:48.300
North America gets much wetter in the north and east, much drier in the south and west.

10:48.300 --> 10:52.460
To see what might happen in your own country, the link is in my video description.

10:52.460 --> 10:58.220
Remember, this isn't one model, it's an amalgam of many different studies showing how much

10:58.220 --> 11:01.260
their conclusions agree or disagree.

11:01.260 --> 11:06.820
And although there's still disagreement in marginal areas, and this is after all a model,

11:06.820 --> 11:11.260
there's little disagreement that the world is headed for more extremes in precipitation

11:11.260 --> 11:14.500
based on simple physical principles.

11:14.500 --> 11:19.420
So to claim that more CO2 and a warming climate will boost food production, either in the

11:19.420 --> 11:24.940
UK or worldwide, is not based on any study that takes into account other factors that

11:24.940 --> 11:27.340
affect plant growth.

11:27.340 --> 11:32.440
This study by Parry et al, for example, shows the effect on cereal crops worldwide over

11:32.440 --> 11:34.380
the next 70 years.

11:34.380 --> 11:39.060
It shows that drought, flooding and heat stress will more than offset the benefits derived

11:39.060 --> 11:42.780
from higher concentrations of CO2 for plant growth.

11:42.780 --> 11:46.660
I won't have time to get into all the effects of climate change in this video, there are

11:46.660 --> 11:48.620
simply too many.

11:48.620 --> 11:53.100
For example, a lot of places that depend on meltwater from glaciers will see that source

11:53.100 --> 11:54.100
dry up.

11:54.220 --> 11:59.180
Oceans are slowly acidifying as more CO2 is dissolved, and that's causing problems for

11:59.180 --> 12:01.180
coral and plankton growth.

12:01.180 --> 12:06.020
As corals begin to die, more coastal land is exposed to erosion from waves and storm

12:06.020 --> 12:07.020
surges.

12:07.020 --> 12:11.840
Ecosystems are being disrupted as organisms become extinct, because it's not just the

12:11.840 --> 12:16.940
rise in temperatures that's a problem, temperatures have risen much more in the past, it's the

12:16.940 --> 12:21.740
rate at which they're rising that's causing problems for organisms that can't move fast

12:21.740 --> 12:23.820
enough to adapt.

12:23.820 --> 12:29.380
As for hurricanes, as I showed in a previous video, they'll be less frequent, but the ones

12:29.380 --> 12:32.100
that do occur will be much stronger.

12:32.100 --> 12:36.620
A warmer Arctic will send winter Arctic weather further south.

12:36.620 --> 12:41.380
Before you start wondering how Georgia and West Virginia can possibly get colder in winter

12:41.380 --> 12:46.060
if the world is supposed to be getting warmer, remember it's called global warming because

12:46.060 --> 12:49.120
the whole globe is warming on average.

12:49.120 --> 12:53.600
So although temperatures may have been way below average where you were this winter,

12:53.600 --> 12:58.880
it was way above average further north in the Arctic.

12:58.880 --> 13:03.200
But there is one effect of global warming that seems the most innocuous, but may end

13:03.200 --> 13:06.060
up being the most damaging of all.

13:06.060 --> 13:12.280
Warming the planet leads to a phenomenon called positive feedback, which amplifies the warming.

13:12.280 --> 13:17.360
So as ice melts, there's less of a white surface on the earth to reflect the sun's energy,

13:17.360 --> 13:19.720
and more dark water to absorb it.

13:19.720 --> 13:22.000
That warms the earth even further.

13:22.000 --> 13:27.040
As the tundra warms, permafrost melts and releases methane, another powerful greenhouse

13:27.040 --> 13:29.640
gas that warms the earth even more.

13:29.640 --> 13:35.200
And as the oceans warm, they become less able to absorb CO2, which is less soluble in warmer

13:35.200 --> 13:39.960
water, and that causes higher concentrations of CO2 in the atmosphere, which warms the

13:39.960 --> 13:41.880
earth further.

13:41.880 --> 13:47.040
So now we come to the really important question, at least to climate critics.

13:47.040 --> 13:48.960
What should we call this?

13:48.960 --> 13:54.840
In the past, the term used for anthropogenic global warming was a simple acronym, AGW.

13:54.840 --> 14:01.820
But in 2007, the term CAGW was coined, that's Catastrophic Anthropogenic Global Warming.

14:01.820 --> 14:07.600
The argument now seems to be that OK, anthropogenic global warming might be real, I suppose that's

14:07.600 --> 14:11.880
progress, but it's not going to be catastrophic.

14:11.880 --> 14:16.400
Now I can't tell you whether the effects we'll see from climate change will be catastrophic,

14:16.400 --> 14:19.280
because I don't know what the climate critics mean by it.

14:19.280 --> 14:23.600
How we feel about something doesn't matter, and it doesn't change either the facts or

14:23.600 --> 14:25.240
the projections.

14:25.240 --> 14:31.600
But if we have to tack an adjective onto AGW, perhaps it should be E for expensive, because

14:31.600 --> 14:38.280
while we can't objectively measure how catastrophic something is, we can estimate the cost.

14:38.280 --> 14:43.520
If we take just sea level rise alone, millions of properties representing trillions of dollars

14:43.520 --> 14:48.520
worth of assets will be permanently lost to a higher sea level in the top 20 cities

14:48.520 --> 14:50.040
at risk.

14:50.040 --> 14:53.840
Then we have to add the increased cost of damage from hurricanes, because although there'll

14:53.840 --> 14:59.720
be fewer of them, each one that does happen will be longer lasting and more powerful.

14:59.720 --> 15:05.400
Researchers estimate total damage from hurricanes will increase by about 30% in real terms,

15:05.400 --> 15:10.120
then add the cost to the fishing industry and agriculture, and well, a report has already

15:10.120 --> 15:11.840
done the sums for us.

15:11.840 --> 15:17.760
In 2006, the Stern Review estimated the cost of climate change will be at least 5% of world

15:17.760 --> 15:24.520
GDP over the next 200 years, but that figure rises to 20% if feedbacks and other factors

15:24.520 --> 15:27.200
are taken into account.

15:27.200 --> 15:31.800
Of course, you can always argue that these estimates are too high, in which case, what

15:31.800 --> 15:33.440
is the cost?

15:33.440 --> 15:38.400
However you want to work it out, it seems that the cost is so high that it's much easier

15:38.400 --> 15:42.960
for some people to pretend that the problem doesn't exist in the first place.

15:42.960 --> 15:47.600
Let's misquote the science and change all the graphs and blame it on the sun, or galactic

15:47.600 --> 15:48.600
rays.

15:48.600 --> 15:52.320
Let's pretend the ice isn't melting and sea levels aren't rising, and that there's no

15:52.320 --> 15:55.320
correlation between CO2 and temperature.

15:55.320 --> 15:58.120
That way we don't even need to look at the cost.

15:58.120 --> 16:02.400
And let's suggest that fixing the problem will bring an end to world civilisation.

16:02.400 --> 16:06.440
Now some politicians want to label carbon dioxide a pollutant.

16:06.440 --> 16:08.480
Imagine if they succeed.

16:08.480 --> 16:10.560
What would our lives be like then?

16:10.560 --> 16:15.120
I'm not alarmed by these scary videos any more than I'm alarmed by climate change.

16:15.120 --> 16:20.560
That's right, climate change doesn't alarm me because we identified the problem decades

16:20.560 --> 16:27.520
ago, we know the cause, and there's no reason why human will and ingenuity can't fix it.

16:27.520 --> 16:32.440
Countries that accept climate science are already starting to develop clean energy technologies

16:32.440 --> 16:37.280
that were unheard of a decade ago, and on the other side of the coin they're also becoming

16:37.280 --> 16:39.840
much more energy efficient.

16:39.840 --> 16:44.960
So much so that it's now possible to have buildings that don't use any net energy, and

16:44.960 --> 16:49.760
households that not only produce their own electricity but sell a surplus back to the

16:49.760 --> 16:51.120
grid.

16:51.120 --> 16:54.940
Already Denmark gets nearly a third of its electricity from wind power.

16:54.940 --> 17:00.640
It's possible to make gasoline from waste biomass that would otherwise rot on the ground.

17:00.640 --> 17:06.120
Research is going into fuel cells that can store and transport energy much more efficiently,

17:06.120 --> 17:10.060
and we haven't even scratched the surface of what future technologies might be able

17:10.060 --> 17:12.320
to achieve.

17:12.320 --> 17:16.960
Of course these technologies, even combined with greater energy efficiency, will never

17:16.960 --> 17:22.720
completely replace fossil fuels, because our energy demands are just too large.

17:22.720 --> 17:28.920
But they don't have to, they just have to reduce CO2 emissions and slow down the warming.

17:28.920 --> 17:33.120
Eventually humankind will have the technology to manage nuclear fusion, which will give

17:33.120 --> 17:35.700
us unlimited clean energy.

17:35.700 --> 17:40.080
But only if we put enough effort and resources into the research.

17:40.080 --> 17:41.640
And that's the problem.

17:41.640 --> 17:46.840
The amount we've spent on developing the world's first nuclear fusion reactor is barely two

17:46.840 --> 17:52.200
thirds the cost of the BP oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico three years ago.

17:52.200 --> 17:57.640
So no, I'm not alarmed by climate change, because we do know how to mitigate the problem

17:58.000 --> 18:04.960
and eventually fix it if we apply our minds to it and recognise that there is a problem.

18:04.960 --> 18:10.480
What does alarm me is that people are so badly educated in basic science that they're willing

18:10.480 --> 18:15.680
to blindly believe the misleading crap they read in blogs and newspapers.

18:15.680 --> 18:20.720
I'm alarmed at the willingness of politicians to ignore the science because they don't understand

18:20.720 --> 18:24.120
it, and turn instead to their own beliefs.

18:24.120 --> 18:29.000
In other words, I'm not alarmed by a problem that our intelligence will allow us to mitigate.

18:29.000 --> 18:34.080
I'm alarmed at our ignorance and gullibility that leads us to willfully ignore it.
