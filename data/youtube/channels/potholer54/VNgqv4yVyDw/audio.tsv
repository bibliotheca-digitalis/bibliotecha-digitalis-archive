0	14520	So now we come to the question of what the consequences of climate change will be.
14520	20040	I think we can safely say that the oceans won't boil and we won't all drown, and neither
20040	23520	will the Earth blow up, as this blog claims.
23520	28040	Of course it's possible under the principle that anything is possible, but these are claims
28040	33200	that aren't supported by the scientific literature, even when they're made in blogs dressed up
33200	35940	to look like scientific papers.
35940	40520	So let's leave aside the controversy and the speculation, and simply look at what will
40520	46720	happen according to scientific research published in respected peer-reviewed journals.
46720	50800	The first and most obvious consequence is that warmer temperatures will cause ice caps
50800	54760	to melt, and this melt will cause sea levels to rise.
54760	59920	We can see how this has happened in the past, most recently at the end of the last glaciation,
59920	63040	when sea levels rose about 200 feet.
63040	67660	Now it's hard to argue that melting ice won't cause sea levels to rise, so the only way
67660	74200	to get around the rising sea levels problem is to try to argue that the ice isn't melting.
74200	78080	You've seen those headlines about global warming.
78080	79920	The glaciers are melting.
79920	82520	We're doomed.
82520	85840	That's what several studies supposedly found.
85840	89840	But other scientific studies found exactly the opposite.
89840	92400	Greenland's glaciers are growing, not melting.
92400	95780	No, no scientific study has found that.
95780	100880	Not even the paper cited in this video by the Competitive Enterprise Institute.
100880	105700	It's the same paper cited by Monckton to make exactly the same claim.
105700	110120	And just like Monckton, the makers of the video didn't actually read the paper before
110120	113040	jumping to their conclusion.
113040	118160	The research paper only looked at the interior of Greenland at higher altitude.
118160	122600	And the author, Johannesson, specifically warns against drawing the conclusion that
122600	127180	there's no net melting, based only on the limited scope of the study.
127180	132020	Because of course ice is melting, or more technically, ablating from the lower altitude
132020	138160	coastal areas of Greenland, and it's melting much faster than it's accumulating.
138160	143680	A regular on my channel, 1000 Frolley, accepts that there's a net loss of ice from Greenland,
143680	147000	but says it's made up for by ice gain in Antarctica.
147000	152980	And he cites a source, a blog by William Robert Johnson, who gives us the benefit of his expertise
152980	158560	on everything from abortion to Daedalus-class starships used in Star Trek.
158560	163320	It's impossible to know how Johnson derived his figures, but it doesn't matter.
163320	167960	The fact that his figures start 15 years before there was any measurable warming of the atmosphere
168400	172980	and long before there was any serious attempt at measuring the ice loss, and they end five
172980	178040	years before Frolley thinks they do, and they're based on Johnson's own extrapolation of what
178040	184000	he admits is a limited amount of data going back that far, and that Johnson himself emphasises
184000	188960	that these figures should only be regarded as illustrative, explains why it's never a
188960	194880	good idea to quote the conclusions of a blogger as if they were proper scientific research.
194880	199800	If you want to play scientist, you have to actually read the scientific literature and
199800	201640	quote that.
201640	204440	So what does the scientific literature say?
204440	209600	Well, just as in the highlands of Greenland, researchers have determined that ice is growing
209600	215320	in areas like East Antarctica and high altitude glaciers, probably, they say, because warmer
215320	219560	air is able to hold more moisture, and that means more snow.
219560	224360	And in West Antarctica, the coastal areas of Greenland and lower glaciers, the ice is
224360	225540	melting.
225540	230800	As in Greenland, the question is, is the amount of cap ice melting worldwide greater than
230800	232800	the amount accumulating?
232800	238520	And the answer, based on these measurements rather than the blogs, is yes, by about 4.3
238520	244860	trillion tonnes in seven years, or about 150 cubic miles a year.
244860	249740	Before I move on, a quick word from those who exaggerate the effects of global warming.
249740	255140	According to Global Warming Siren, polar ice caps could vanish within five years.
255140	257740	And that was back in 2010.
257740	258740	The source?
258740	260180	Hal Gore.
260180	263540	As always, we need to check the primary source.
263540	267860	Gore bases his claim on a study by Wieslaw Maslowski.
267860	272500	What Gore didn't mention was that most studies disagree with this conclusion.
272500	278740	They predict an ice-free North Pole is several decades away, as Maslowski himself acknowledges.
278740	284220	So the same message goes out to the climate exaggerators, stop quoting blogs and politicians
284220	288460	and start reading the scientific literature if you're going to take it upon yourselves
288460	291180	to report on climate change.
291180	296140	By the way, melting sea ice makes no difference to sea levels because the ice is already in
296140	297760	the sea.
297760	300900	It's cap ice that makes the difference.
300900	306620	With 150 cubic miles of this ice melting every year, basic physics tells us that this
306620	309200	will cause sea levels to rise.
309200	314820	And basic physics also tells us that as water warms up, it expands, so on top of the rise
314820	321300	due to ice melt, researchers say sea levels will also rise because of thermal expansion.
321300	323600	There are two ways to calculate this.
323600	327860	One is to estimate how much ice will melt and how much the oceans will expand for a
327860	332940	given rise in temperature, and that gives us a figure of between 0.8 and 2 metres by
332940	338120	the end of the century, depending on how much CO2 is pumped into the atmosphere.
338120	342940	Another way of estimating it is to see how much sea levels rose in the past for a given
342940	348420	rise in temperature, and that gives a similar range between 1 and 2 metres by the end of
348420	349420	this century.
349420	354500	0.8 metres, the low end of the estimates, may not sound like much.
354500	356300	It's about 3 feet.
356300	360960	But it's enough to submerge large areas of coastline, including parts of coastal cities
360960	367660	like Miami, Guangzhou, New York and Calcutta, and Tokyo, Hong Kong, Bangkok, New Orleans,
367660	369460	Amsterdam and Rotterdam.
369460	374860	2 metres, the high end of the scale, is over 6 feet.
374860	377280	Still the urban myths persist.
377280	382360	And who better to demonstrate them than our old friend 1000 Frolley, who calls my reporting
382360	385660	on sea level rise misleading tosh.
385660	391700	Cottie's claim of a 100 centimetre rise, that's a metre, by 2100 is pure fiction, based
391700	394740	on IPCC alarmism.
394740	397040	Well first of all, of course, this isn't my claim.
397040	401380	I'm just doing what I always do in my videos, which is to report what's published in the
401380	403260	scientific literature.
403260	407440	Secondly, I don't use the IPCC as a source.
407440	412860	My sources are either listed in the video description or the videos themselves.
412860	418420	So this can only be misleading tosh if I've misreported the papers, which apparently I
418420	424220	haven't, or if other research rebuts it, which Frolley seems to think it does.
424220	429860	He cites a paper by Lilliet and Nerem at the University of Colorado, which has a unit dedicated
429860	431960	to sea level change.
431960	436180	The quote shows that if you look at sea level changes, which have been rising for the past
436180	441900	20 years according to this graph by the University of Colorado, and then pick out carefully selected
441940	447140	years, it appears as though future sea level increases are in decline.
447140	452340	It's such a convoluted, cherry-picked and weird way of doing science, I was astonished
452340	458060	that respected researchers like Nerem and Lilliet would write anything so ridiculous.
458060	459620	And of course they didn't.
459620	465900	The conclusion and the quote come, no surprise, from the blogosphere, in this case a website
465900	472420	called Climate for You, run by the political lobby group Committee for a Constructive Tomorrow.
472420	478020	And even Climate for You agrees that deriving figures in this weird and convoluted way is
478020	479800	not realistic.
479800	485500	The real forecast by the University of Colorado is the one Frolley said was tosh and misleading
485500	489020	nonsense, 0.8 to 2 metres.
489020	493740	Once again it illustrates the danger of trusting a blogger to tell you what's in the scientific
493740	495940	literature.
495940	498140	But let's go on to some good news.
498140	503780	More CO2 is definitely good for plant growth because plants depend on carbon dioxide for
503780	505700	photosynthesis.
505700	510620	Experiments have shown that plants grow much better in higher concentrations of CO2, which
510620	514380	is why nurseries often pump CO2 into greenhouses.
514380	519660	Higher CO2 also allows plants to open their pores less widely, which means they won't
519660	523220	lose so much water to evapotranspiration.
523220	527220	And in higher latitudes, plants grow faster in warmer temperatures.
527220	532820	According to the Daily Mail, global warming would boost Britain's farm crops by 10%.
532820	534660	What's the Mail's source?
534660	539060	Well it's quoting a study by the Met Office, Britain's meteorological office, which found
539060	543780	that seasonal frosts would start later and finish earlier, and that's definitely good
543780	545300	for plant growth.
545300	549780	Trouble is, other predictions in the same Met Office report look a bit grimmer, like
549780	552780	water shortages, flooding and heat stress.
552780	557380	And it turns out that crop losses due to these other factors more than offset the gains
557380	561420	illustrated in the Mail headline because of warmer temperatures.
561420	566340	The Mail does report these negative effects, but further down in the story.
566340	572540	Yes, some things like increased CO2 and fewer frosts will boost crop production.
572540	577220	Other things like more frequent drought, stronger hurricanes, rising sea levels, heat stress,
577220	580700	salination and increased flooding will reduce it.
580700	584740	And it's the drought and the flooding that have the experts concerned.
584740	586880	So let's look at that.
586880	592660	As I said, higher temperatures mean the air can hold more water vapour, about 7.5% more
592660	595320	for every degree centigrade rise.
595320	598140	So you'd think that would cause more rainfall.
598140	602740	Well yes it will, say climatologists, but only in certain areas.
602740	604360	Here's why.
604360	609100	As the world gets warmer, the extreme latitudes warm faster than lower latitudes.
609100	614020	As a result, global air circulation will slow down because it's the difference in temperature
614020	615680	that drives winds.
615680	620300	The problem is, even rainfall relies on the circulation of humid air.
620300	625220	If the circulation slows down, then air masses will tend to stay put.
625220	631160	As a rule of thumb, dry regions will get drier, and wet regions will get wetter.
631160	635540	To see what that'll look like, the Met Office combined a number of studies from different
635540	636540	countries.
636540	640980	There's Britain getting much wetter in the winter, but drier in the summer in the south
640980	642700	of England.
642700	648300	North America gets much wetter in the north and east, much drier in the south and west.
648300	652460	To see what might happen in your own country, the link is in my video description.
652460	658220	Remember, this isn't one model, it's an amalgam of many different studies showing how much
658220	661260	their conclusions agree or disagree.
661260	666820	And although there's still disagreement in marginal areas, and this is after all a model,
666820	671260	there's little disagreement that the world is headed for more extremes in precipitation
671260	674500	based on simple physical principles.
674500	679420	So to claim that more CO2 and a warming climate will boost food production, either in the
679420	684940	UK or worldwide, is not based on any study that takes into account other factors that
684940	687340	affect plant growth.
687340	692440	This study by Parry et al, for example, shows the effect on cereal crops worldwide over
692440	694380	the next 70 years.
694380	699060	It shows that drought, flooding and heat stress will more than offset the benefits derived
699060	702780	from higher concentrations of CO2 for plant growth.
702780	706660	I won't have time to get into all the effects of climate change in this video, there are
706660	708620	simply too many.
708620	713100	For example, a lot of places that depend on meltwater from glaciers will see that source
713100	714100	dry up.
714220	719180	Oceans are slowly acidifying as more CO2 is dissolved, and that's causing problems for
719180	721180	coral and plankton growth.
721180	726020	As corals begin to die, more coastal land is exposed to erosion from waves and storm
726020	727020	surges.
727020	731840	Ecosystems are being disrupted as organisms become extinct, because it's not just the
731840	736940	rise in temperatures that's a problem, temperatures have risen much more in the past, it's the
736940	741740	rate at which they're rising that's causing problems for organisms that can't move fast
741740	743820	enough to adapt.
743820	749380	As for hurricanes, as I showed in a previous video, they'll be less frequent, but the ones
749380	752100	that do occur will be much stronger.
752100	756620	A warmer Arctic will send winter Arctic weather further south.
756620	761380	Before you start wondering how Georgia and West Virginia can possibly get colder in winter
761380	766060	if the world is supposed to be getting warmer, remember it's called global warming because
766060	769120	the whole globe is warming on average.
769120	773600	So although temperatures may have been way below average where you were this winter,
773600	778880	it was way above average further north in the Arctic.
778880	783200	But there is one effect of global warming that seems the most innocuous, but may end
783200	786060	up being the most damaging of all.
786060	792280	Warming the planet leads to a phenomenon called positive feedback, which amplifies the warming.
792280	797360	So as ice melts, there's less of a white surface on the earth to reflect the sun's energy,
797360	799720	and more dark water to absorb it.
799720	802000	That warms the earth even further.
802000	807040	As the tundra warms, permafrost melts and releases methane, another powerful greenhouse
807040	809640	gas that warms the earth even more.
809640	815200	And as the oceans warm, they become less able to absorb CO2, which is less soluble in warmer
815200	819960	water, and that causes higher concentrations of CO2 in the atmosphere, which warms the
819960	821880	earth further.
821880	827040	So now we come to the really important question, at least to climate critics.
827040	828960	What should we call this?
828960	834840	In the past, the term used for anthropogenic global warming was a simple acronym, AGW.
834840	841820	But in 2007, the term CAGW was coined, that's Catastrophic Anthropogenic Global Warming.
841820	847600	The argument now seems to be that OK, anthropogenic global warming might be real, I suppose that's
847600	851880	progress, but it's not going to be catastrophic.
851880	856400	Now I can't tell you whether the effects we'll see from climate change will be catastrophic,
856400	859280	because I don't know what the climate critics mean by it.
859280	863600	How we feel about something doesn't matter, and it doesn't change either the facts or
863600	865240	the projections.
865240	871600	But if we have to tack an adjective onto AGW, perhaps it should be E for expensive, because
871600	878280	while we can't objectively measure how catastrophic something is, we can estimate the cost.
878280	883520	If we take just sea level rise alone, millions of properties representing trillions of dollars
883520	888520	worth of assets will be permanently lost to a higher sea level in the top 20 cities
888520	890040	at risk.
890040	893840	Then we have to add the increased cost of damage from hurricanes, because although there'll
893840	899720	be fewer of them, each one that does happen will be longer lasting and more powerful.
899720	905400	Researchers estimate total damage from hurricanes will increase by about 30% in real terms,
905400	910120	then add the cost to the fishing industry and agriculture, and well, a report has already
910120	911840	done the sums for us.
911840	917760	In 2006, the Stern Review estimated the cost of climate change will be at least 5% of world
917760	924520	GDP over the next 200 years, but that figure rises to 20% if feedbacks and other factors
924520	927200	are taken into account.
927200	931800	Of course, you can always argue that these estimates are too high, in which case, what
931800	933440	is the cost?
933440	938400	However you want to work it out, it seems that the cost is so high that it's much easier
938400	942960	for some people to pretend that the problem doesn't exist in the first place.
942960	947600	Let's misquote the science and change all the graphs and blame it on the sun, or galactic
947600	948600	rays.
948600	952320	Let's pretend the ice isn't melting and sea levels aren't rising, and that there's no
952320	955320	correlation between CO2 and temperature.
955320	958120	That way we don't even need to look at the cost.
958120	962400	And let's suggest that fixing the problem will bring an end to world civilisation.
962400	966440	Now some politicians want to label carbon dioxide a pollutant.
966440	968480	Imagine if they succeed.
968480	970560	What would our lives be like then?
970560	975120	I'm not alarmed by these scary videos any more than I'm alarmed by climate change.
975120	980560	That's right, climate change doesn't alarm me because we identified the problem decades
980560	987520	ago, we know the cause, and there's no reason why human will and ingenuity can't fix it.
987520	992440	Countries that accept climate science are already starting to develop clean energy technologies
992440	997280	that were unheard of a decade ago, and on the other side of the coin they're also becoming
997280	999840	much more energy efficient.
999840	1004960	So much so that it's now possible to have buildings that don't use any net energy, and
1004960	1009760	households that not only produce their own electricity but sell a surplus back to the
1009760	1011120	grid.
1011120	1014940	Already Denmark gets nearly a third of its electricity from wind power.
1014940	1020640	It's possible to make gasoline from waste biomass that would otherwise rot on the ground.
1020640	1026120	Research is going into fuel cells that can store and transport energy much more efficiently,
1026120	1030060	and we haven't even scratched the surface of what future technologies might be able
1030060	1032320	to achieve.
1032320	1036960	Of course these technologies, even combined with greater energy efficiency, will never
1036960	1042720	completely replace fossil fuels, because our energy demands are just too large.
1042720	1048920	But they don't have to, they just have to reduce CO2 emissions and slow down the warming.
1048920	1053120	Eventually humankind will have the technology to manage nuclear fusion, which will give
1053120	1055700	us unlimited clean energy.
1055700	1060080	But only if we put enough effort and resources into the research.
1060080	1061640	And that's the problem.
1061640	1066840	The amount we've spent on developing the world's first nuclear fusion reactor is barely two
1066840	1072200	thirds the cost of the BP oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico three years ago.
1072200	1077640	So no, I'm not alarmed by climate change, because we do know how to mitigate the problem
1078000	1084960	and eventually fix it if we apply our minds to it and recognise that there is a problem.
1084960	1090480	What does alarm me is that people are so badly educated in basic science that they're willing
1090480	1095680	to blindly believe the misleading crap they read in blogs and newspapers.
1095680	1100720	I'm alarmed at the willingness of politicians to ignore the science because they don't understand
