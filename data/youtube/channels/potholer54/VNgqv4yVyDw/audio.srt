1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:14,520
So now we come to the question of what the consequences of climate change will be.

2
00:00:14,520 --> 00:00:20,040
I think we can safely say that the oceans won't boil and we won't all drown, and neither

3
00:00:20,040 --> 00:00:23,520
will the Earth blow up, as this blog claims.

4
00:00:23,520 --> 00:00:28,040
Of course it's possible under the principle that anything is possible, but these are claims

5
00:00:28,040 --> 00:00:33,200
that aren't supported by the scientific literature, even when they're made in blogs dressed up

6
00:00:33,200 --> 00:00:35,940
to look like scientific papers.

7
00:00:35,940 --> 00:00:40,520
So let's leave aside the controversy and the speculation, and simply look at what will

8
00:00:40,520 --> 00:00:46,720
happen according to scientific research published in respected peer-reviewed journals.

9
00:00:46,720 --> 00:00:50,800
The first and most obvious consequence is that warmer temperatures will cause ice caps

10
00:00:50,800 --> 00:00:54,760
to melt, and this melt will cause sea levels to rise.

11
00:00:54,760 --> 00:00:59,920
We can see how this has happened in the past, most recently at the end of the last glaciation,

12
00:00:59,920 --> 00:01:03,040
when sea levels rose about 200 feet.

13
00:01:03,040 --> 00:01:07,660
Now it's hard to argue that melting ice won't cause sea levels to rise, so the only way

14
00:01:07,660 --> 00:01:14,200
to get around the rising sea levels problem is to try to argue that the ice isn't melting.

15
00:01:14,200 --> 00:01:18,080
You've seen those headlines about global warming.

16
00:01:18,080 --> 00:01:19,920
The glaciers are melting.

17
00:01:19,920 --> 00:01:22,520
We're doomed.

18
00:01:22,520 --> 00:01:25,840
That's what several studies supposedly found.

19
00:01:25,840 --> 00:01:29,840
But other scientific studies found exactly the opposite.

20
00:01:29,840 --> 00:01:32,400
Greenland's glaciers are growing, not melting.

21
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:35,780
No, no scientific study has found that.

22
00:01:35,780 --> 00:01:40,880
Not even the paper cited in this video by the Competitive Enterprise Institute.

23
00:01:40,880 --> 00:01:45,700
It's the same paper cited by Monckton to make exactly the same claim.

24
00:01:45,700 --> 00:01:50,120
And just like Monckton, the makers of the video didn't actually read the paper before

25
00:01:50,120 --> 00:01:53,040
jumping to their conclusion.

26
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:58,160
The research paper only looked at the interior of Greenland at higher altitude.

27
00:01:58,160 --> 00:02:02,600
And the author, Johannesson, specifically warns against drawing the conclusion that

28
00:02:02,600 --> 00:02:07,180
there's no net melting, based only on the limited scope of the study.

29
00:02:07,180 --> 00:02:12,020
Because of course ice is melting, or more technically, ablating from the lower altitude

30
00:02:12,020 --> 00:02:18,160
coastal areas of Greenland, and it's melting much faster than it's accumulating.

31
00:02:18,160 --> 00:02:23,680
A regular on my channel, 1000 Frolley, accepts that there's a net loss of ice from Greenland,

32
00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:27,000
but says it's made up for by ice gain in Antarctica.

33
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:32,980
And he cites a source, a blog by William Robert Johnson, who gives us the benefit of his expertise

34
00:02:32,980 --> 00:02:38,560
on everything from abortion to Daedalus-class starships used in Star Trek.

35
00:02:38,560 --> 00:02:43,320
It's impossible to know how Johnson derived his figures, but it doesn't matter.

36
00:02:43,320 --> 00:02:47,960
The fact that his figures start 15 years before there was any measurable warming of the atmosphere

37
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:52,980
and long before there was any serious attempt at measuring the ice loss, and they end five

38
00:02:52,980 --> 00:02:58,040
years before Frolley thinks they do, and they're based on Johnson's own extrapolation of what

39
00:02:58,040 --> 00:03:04,000
he admits is a limited amount of data going back that far, and that Johnson himself emphasises

40
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:08,960
that these figures should only be regarded as illustrative, explains why it's never a

41
00:03:08,960 --> 00:03:14,880
good idea to quote the conclusions of a blogger as if they were proper scientific research.

42
00:03:14,880 --> 00:03:19,800
If you want to play scientist, you have to actually read the scientific literature and

43
00:03:19,800 --> 00:03:21,640
quote that.

44
00:03:21,640 --> 00:03:24,440
So what does the scientific literature say?

45
00:03:24,440 --> 00:03:29,600
Well, just as in the highlands of Greenland, researchers have determined that ice is growing

46
00:03:29,600 --> 00:03:35,320
in areas like East Antarctica and high altitude glaciers, probably, they say, because warmer

47
00:03:35,320 --> 00:03:39,560
air is able to hold more moisture, and that means more snow.

48
00:03:39,560 --> 00:03:44,360
And in West Antarctica, the coastal areas of Greenland and lower glaciers, the ice is

49
00:03:44,360 --> 00:03:45,540
melting.

50
00:03:45,540 --> 00:03:50,800
As in Greenland, the question is, is the amount of cap ice melting worldwide greater than

51
00:03:50,800 --> 00:03:52,800
the amount accumulating?

52
00:03:52,800 --> 00:03:58,520
And the answer, based on these measurements rather than the blogs, is yes, by about 4.3

53
00:03:58,520 --> 00:04:04,860
trillion tonnes in seven years, or about 150 cubic miles a year.

54
00:04:04,860 --> 00:04:09,740
Before I move on, a quick word from those who exaggerate the effects of global warming.

55
00:04:09,740 --> 00:04:15,140
According to Global Warming Siren, polar ice caps could vanish within five years.

56
00:04:15,140 --> 00:04:17,740
And that was back in 2010.

57
00:04:17,740 --> 00:04:18,740
The source?

58
00:04:18,740 --> 00:04:20,180
Hal Gore.

59
00:04:20,180 --> 00:04:23,540
As always, we need to check the primary source.

60
00:04:23,540 --> 00:04:27,860
Gore bases his claim on a study by Wieslaw Maslowski.

61
00:04:27,860 --> 00:04:32,500
What Gore didn't mention was that most studies disagree with this conclusion.

62
00:04:32,500 --> 00:04:38,740
They predict an ice-free North Pole is several decades away, as Maslowski himself acknowledges.

63
00:04:38,740 --> 00:04:44,220
So the same message goes out to the climate exaggerators, stop quoting blogs and politicians

64
00:04:44,220 --> 00:04:48,460
and start reading the scientific literature if you're going to take it upon yourselves

65
00:04:48,460 --> 00:04:51,180
to report on climate change.

66
00:04:51,180 --> 00:04:56,140
By the way, melting sea ice makes no difference to sea levels because the ice is already in

67
00:04:56,140 --> 00:04:57,760
the sea.

68
00:04:57,760 --> 00:05:00,900
It's cap ice that makes the difference.

69
00:05:00,900 --> 00:05:06,620
With 150 cubic miles of this ice melting every year, basic physics tells us that this

70
00:05:06,620 --> 00:05:09,200
will cause sea levels to rise.

71
00:05:09,200 --> 00:05:14,820
And basic physics also tells us that as water warms up, it expands, so on top of the rise

72
00:05:14,820 --> 00:05:21,300
due to ice melt, researchers say sea levels will also rise because of thermal expansion.

73
00:05:21,300 --> 00:05:23,600
There are two ways to calculate this.

74
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:27,860
One is to estimate how much ice will melt and how much the oceans will expand for a

75
00:05:27,860 --> 00:05:32,940
given rise in temperature, and that gives us a figure of between 0.8 and 2 metres by

76
00:05:32,940 --> 00:05:38,120
the end of the century, depending on how much CO2 is pumped into the atmosphere.

77
00:05:38,120 --> 00:05:42,940
Another way of estimating it is to see how much sea levels rose in the past for a given

78
00:05:42,940 --> 00:05:48,420
rise in temperature, and that gives a similar range between 1 and 2 metres by the end of

79
00:05:48,420 --> 00:05:49,420
this century.

80
00:05:49,420 --> 00:05:54,500
0.8 metres, the low end of the estimates, may not sound like much.

81
00:05:54,500 --> 00:05:56,300
It's about 3 feet.

82
00:05:56,300 --> 00:06:00,960
But it's enough to submerge large areas of coastline, including parts of coastal cities

83
00:06:00,960 --> 00:06:07,660
like Miami, Guangzhou, New York and Calcutta, and Tokyo, Hong Kong, Bangkok, New Orleans,

84
00:06:07,660 --> 00:06:09,460
Amsterdam and Rotterdam.

85
00:06:09,460 --> 00:06:14,860
2 metres, the high end of the scale, is over 6 feet.

86
00:06:14,860 --> 00:06:17,280
Still the urban myths persist.

87
00:06:17,280 --> 00:06:22,360
And who better to demonstrate them than our old friend 1000 Frolley, who calls my reporting

88
00:06:22,360 --> 00:06:25,660
on sea level rise misleading tosh.

89
00:06:25,660 --> 00:06:31,700
Cottie's claim of a 100 centimetre rise, that's a metre, by 2100 is pure fiction, based

90
00:06:31,700 --> 00:06:34,740
on IPCC alarmism.

91
00:06:34,740 --> 00:06:37,040
Well first of all, of course, this isn't my claim.

92
00:06:37,040 --> 00:06:41,380
I'm just doing what I always do in my videos, which is to report what's published in the

93
00:06:41,380 --> 00:06:43,260
scientific literature.

94
00:06:43,260 --> 00:06:47,440
Secondly, I don't use the IPCC as a source.

95
00:06:47,440 --> 00:06:52,860
My sources are either listed in the video description or the videos themselves.

96
00:06:52,860 --> 00:06:58,420
So this can only be misleading tosh if I've misreported the papers, which apparently I

97
00:06:58,420 --> 00:07:04,220
haven't, or if other research rebuts it, which Frolley seems to think it does.

98
00:07:04,220 --> 00:07:09,860
He cites a paper by Lilliet and Nerem at the University of Colorado, which has a unit dedicated

99
00:07:09,860 --> 00:07:11,960
to sea level change.

100
00:07:11,960 --> 00:07:16,180
The quote shows that if you look at sea level changes, which have been rising for the past

101
00:07:16,180 --> 00:07:21,900
20 years according to this graph by the University of Colorado, and then pick out carefully selected

102
00:07:21,940 --> 00:07:27,140
years, it appears as though future sea level increases are in decline.

103
00:07:27,140 --> 00:07:32,340
It's such a convoluted, cherry-picked and weird way of doing science, I was astonished

104
00:07:32,340 --> 00:07:38,060
that respected researchers like Nerem and Lilliet would write anything so ridiculous.

105
00:07:38,060 --> 00:07:39,620
And of course they didn't.

106
00:07:39,620 --> 00:07:45,900
The conclusion and the quote come, no surprise, from the blogosphere, in this case a website

107
00:07:45,900 --> 00:07:52,420
called Climate for You, run by the political lobby group Committee for a Constructive Tomorrow.

108
00:07:52,420 --> 00:07:58,020
And even Climate for You agrees that deriving figures in this weird and convoluted way is

109
00:07:58,020 --> 00:07:59,800
not realistic.

110
00:07:59,800 --> 00:08:05,500
The real forecast by the University of Colorado is the one Frolley said was tosh and misleading

111
00:08:05,500 --> 00:08:09,020
nonsense, 0.8 to 2 metres.

112
00:08:09,020 --> 00:08:13,740
Once again it illustrates the danger of trusting a blogger to tell you what's in the scientific

113
00:08:13,740 --> 00:08:15,940
literature.

114
00:08:15,940 --> 00:08:18,140
But let's go on to some good news.

115
00:08:18,140 --> 00:08:23,780
More CO2 is definitely good for plant growth because plants depend on carbon dioxide for

116
00:08:23,780 --> 00:08:25,700
photosynthesis.

117
00:08:25,700 --> 00:08:30,620
Experiments have shown that plants grow much better in higher concentrations of CO2, which

118
00:08:30,620 --> 00:08:34,380
is why nurseries often pump CO2 into greenhouses.

119
00:08:34,380 --> 00:08:39,660
Higher CO2 also allows plants to open their pores less widely, which means they won't

120
00:08:39,660 --> 00:08:43,220
lose so much water to evapotranspiration.

121
00:08:43,220 --> 00:08:47,220
And in higher latitudes, plants grow faster in warmer temperatures.

122
00:08:47,220 --> 00:08:52,820
According to the Daily Mail, global warming would boost Britain's farm crops by 10%.

123
00:08:52,820 --> 00:08:54,660
What's the Mail's source?

124
00:08:54,660 --> 00:08:59,060
Well it's quoting a study by the Met Office, Britain's meteorological office, which found

125
00:08:59,060 --> 00:09:03,780
that seasonal frosts would start later and finish earlier, and that's definitely good

126
00:09:03,780 --> 00:09:05,300
for plant growth.

127
00:09:05,300 --> 00:09:09,780
Trouble is, other predictions in the same Met Office report look a bit grimmer, like

128
00:09:09,780 --> 00:09:12,780
water shortages, flooding and heat stress.

129
00:09:12,780 --> 00:09:17,380
And it turns out that crop losses due to these other factors more than offset the gains

130
00:09:17,380 --> 00:09:21,420
illustrated in the Mail headline because of warmer temperatures.

131
00:09:21,420 --> 00:09:26,340
The Mail does report these negative effects, but further down in the story.

132
00:09:26,340 --> 00:09:32,540
Yes, some things like increased CO2 and fewer frosts will boost crop production.

133
00:09:32,540 --> 00:09:37,220
Other things like more frequent drought, stronger hurricanes, rising sea levels, heat stress,

134
00:09:37,220 --> 00:09:40,700
salination and increased flooding will reduce it.

135
00:09:40,700 --> 00:09:44,740
And it's the drought and the flooding that have the experts concerned.

136
00:09:44,740 --> 00:09:46,880
So let's look at that.

137
00:09:46,880 --> 00:09:52,660
As I said, higher temperatures mean the air can hold more water vapour, about 7.5% more

138
00:09:52,660 --> 00:09:55,320
for every degree centigrade rise.

139
00:09:55,320 --> 00:09:58,140
So you'd think that would cause more rainfall.

140
00:09:58,140 --> 00:10:02,740
Well yes it will, say climatologists, but only in certain areas.

141
00:10:02,740 --> 00:10:04,360
Here's why.

142
00:10:04,360 --> 00:10:09,100
As the world gets warmer, the extreme latitudes warm faster than lower latitudes.

143
00:10:09,100 --> 00:10:14,020
As a result, global air circulation will slow down because it's the difference in temperature

144
00:10:14,020 --> 00:10:15,680
that drives winds.

145
00:10:15,680 --> 00:10:20,300
The problem is, even rainfall relies on the circulation of humid air.

146
00:10:20,300 --> 00:10:25,220
If the circulation slows down, then air masses will tend to stay put.

147
00:10:25,220 --> 00:10:31,160
As a rule of thumb, dry regions will get drier, and wet regions will get wetter.

148
00:10:31,160 --> 00:10:35,540
To see what that'll look like, the Met Office combined a number of studies from different

149
00:10:35,540 --> 00:10:36,540
countries.

150
00:10:36,540 --> 00:10:40,980
There's Britain getting much wetter in the winter, but drier in the summer in the south

151
00:10:40,980 --> 00:10:42,700
of England.

152
00:10:42,700 --> 00:10:48,300
North America gets much wetter in the north and east, much drier in the south and west.

153
00:10:48,300 --> 00:10:52,460
To see what might happen in your own country, the link is in my video description.

154
00:10:52,460 --> 00:10:58,220
Remember, this isn't one model, it's an amalgam of many different studies showing how much

155
00:10:58,220 --> 00:11:01,260
their conclusions agree or disagree.

156
00:11:01,260 --> 00:11:06,820
And although there's still disagreement in marginal areas, and this is after all a model,

157
00:11:06,820 --> 00:11:11,260
there's little disagreement that the world is headed for more extremes in precipitation

158
00:11:11,260 --> 00:11:14,500
based on simple physical principles.

159
00:11:14,500 --> 00:11:19,420
So to claim that more CO2 and a warming climate will boost food production, either in the

160
00:11:19,420 --> 00:11:24,940
UK or worldwide, is not based on any study that takes into account other factors that

161
00:11:24,940 --> 00:11:27,340
affect plant growth.

162
00:11:27,340 --> 00:11:32,440
This study by Parry et al, for example, shows the effect on cereal crops worldwide over

163
00:11:32,440 --> 00:11:34,380
the next 70 years.

164
00:11:34,380 --> 00:11:39,060
It shows that drought, flooding and heat stress will more than offset the benefits derived

165
00:11:39,060 --> 00:11:42,780
from higher concentrations of CO2 for plant growth.

166
00:11:42,780 --> 00:11:46,660
I won't have time to get into all the effects of climate change in this video, there are

167
00:11:46,660 --> 00:11:48,620
simply too many.

168
00:11:48,620 --> 00:11:53,100
For example, a lot of places that depend on meltwater from glaciers will see that source

169
00:11:53,100 --> 00:11:54,100
dry up.

170
00:11:54,220 --> 00:11:59,180
Oceans are slowly acidifying as more CO2 is dissolved, and that's causing problems for

171
00:11:59,180 --> 00:12:01,180
coral and plankton growth.

172
00:12:01,180 --> 00:12:06,020
As corals begin to die, more coastal land is exposed to erosion from waves and storm

173
00:12:06,020 --> 00:12:07,020
surges.

174
00:12:07,020 --> 00:12:11,840
Ecosystems are being disrupted as organisms become extinct, because it's not just the

175
00:12:11,840 --> 00:12:16,940
rise in temperatures that's a problem, temperatures have risen much more in the past, it's the

176
00:12:16,940 --> 00:12:21,740
rate at which they're rising that's causing problems for organisms that can't move fast

177
00:12:21,740 --> 00:12:23,820
enough to adapt.

178
00:12:23,820 --> 00:12:29,380
As for hurricanes, as I showed in a previous video, they'll be less frequent, but the ones

179
00:12:29,380 --> 00:12:32,100
that do occur will be much stronger.

180
00:12:32,100 --> 00:12:36,620
A warmer Arctic will send winter Arctic weather further south.

181
00:12:36,620 --> 00:12:41,380
Before you start wondering how Georgia and West Virginia can possibly get colder in winter

182
00:12:41,380 --> 00:12:46,060
if the world is supposed to be getting warmer, remember it's called global warming because

183
00:12:46,060 --> 00:12:49,120
the whole globe is warming on average.

184
00:12:49,120 --> 00:12:53,600
So although temperatures may have been way below average where you were this winter,

185
00:12:53,600 --> 00:12:58,880
it was way above average further north in the Arctic.

186
00:12:58,880 --> 00:13:03,200
But there is one effect of global warming that seems the most innocuous, but may end

187
00:13:03,200 --> 00:13:06,060
up being the most damaging of all.

188
00:13:06,060 --> 00:13:12,280
Warming the planet leads to a phenomenon called positive feedback, which amplifies the warming.

189
00:13:12,280 --> 00:13:17,360
So as ice melts, there's less of a white surface on the earth to reflect the sun's energy,

190
00:13:17,360 --> 00:13:19,720
and more dark water to absorb it.

191
00:13:19,720 --> 00:13:22,000
That warms the earth even further.

192
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:27,040
As the tundra warms, permafrost melts and releases methane, another powerful greenhouse

193
00:13:27,040 --> 00:13:29,640
gas that warms the earth even more.

194
00:13:29,640 --> 00:13:35,200
And as the oceans warm, they become less able to absorb CO2, which is less soluble in warmer

195
00:13:35,200 --> 00:13:39,960
water, and that causes higher concentrations of CO2 in the atmosphere, which warms the

196
00:13:39,960 --> 00:13:41,880
earth further.

197
00:13:41,880 --> 00:13:47,040
So now we come to the really important question, at least to climate critics.

198
00:13:47,040 --> 00:13:48,960
What should we call this?

199
00:13:48,960 --> 00:13:54,840
In the past, the term used for anthropogenic global warming was a simple acronym, AGW.

200
00:13:54,840 --> 00:14:01,820
But in 2007, the term CAGW was coined, that's Catastrophic Anthropogenic Global Warming.

201
00:14:01,820 --> 00:14:07,600
The argument now seems to be that OK, anthropogenic global warming might be real, I suppose that's

202
00:14:07,600 --> 00:14:11,880
progress, but it's not going to be catastrophic.

203
00:14:11,880 --> 00:14:16,400
Now I can't tell you whether the effects we'll see from climate change will be catastrophic,

204
00:14:16,400 --> 00:14:19,280
because I don't know what the climate critics mean by it.

205
00:14:19,280 --> 00:14:23,600
How we feel about something doesn't matter, and it doesn't change either the facts or

206
00:14:23,600 --> 00:14:25,240
the projections.

207
00:14:25,240 --> 00:14:31,600
But if we have to tack an adjective onto AGW, perhaps it should be E for expensive, because

208
00:14:31,600 --> 00:14:38,280
while we can't objectively measure how catastrophic something is, we can estimate the cost.

209
00:14:38,280 --> 00:14:43,520
If we take just sea level rise alone, millions of properties representing trillions of dollars

210
00:14:43,520 --> 00:14:48,520
worth of assets will be permanently lost to a higher sea level in the top 20 cities

211
00:14:48,520 --> 00:14:50,040
at risk.

212
00:14:50,040 --> 00:14:53,840
Then we have to add the increased cost of damage from hurricanes, because although there'll

213
00:14:53,840 --> 00:14:59,720
be fewer of them, each one that does happen will be longer lasting and more powerful.

214
00:14:59,720 --> 00:15:05,400
Researchers estimate total damage from hurricanes will increase by about 30% in real terms,

215
00:15:05,400 --> 00:15:10,120
then add the cost to the fishing industry and agriculture, and well, a report has already

216
00:15:10,120 --> 00:15:11,840
done the sums for us.

217
00:15:11,840 --> 00:15:17,760
In 2006, the Stern Review estimated the cost of climate change will be at least 5% of world

218
00:15:17,760 --> 00:15:24,520
GDP over the next 200 years, but that figure rises to 20% if feedbacks and other factors

219
00:15:24,520 --> 00:15:27,200
are taken into account.

220
00:15:27,200 --> 00:15:31,800
Of course, you can always argue that these estimates are too high, in which case, what

221
00:15:31,800 --> 00:15:33,440
is the cost?

222
00:15:33,440 --> 00:15:38,400
However you want to work it out, it seems that the cost is so high that it's much easier

223
00:15:38,400 --> 00:15:42,960
for some people to pretend that the problem doesn't exist in the first place.

224
00:15:42,960 --> 00:15:47,600
Let's misquote the science and change all the graphs and blame it on the sun, or galactic

225
00:15:47,600 --> 00:15:48,600
rays.

226
00:15:48,600 --> 00:15:52,320
Let's pretend the ice isn't melting and sea levels aren't rising, and that there's no

227
00:15:52,320 --> 00:15:55,320
correlation between CO2 and temperature.

228
00:15:55,320 --> 00:15:58,120
That way we don't even need to look at the cost.

229
00:15:58,120 --> 00:16:02,400
And let's suggest that fixing the problem will bring an end to world civilisation.

230
00:16:02,400 --> 00:16:06,440
Now some politicians want to label carbon dioxide a pollutant.

231
00:16:06,440 --> 00:16:08,480
Imagine if they succeed.

232
00:16:08,480 --> 00:16:10,560
What would our lives be like then?

233
00:16:10,560 --> 00:16:15,120
I'm not alarmed by these scary videos any more than I'm alarmed by climate change.

234
00:16:15,120 --> 00:16:20,560
That's right, climate change doesn't alarm me because we identified the problem decades

235
00:16:20,560 --> 00:16:27,520
ago, we know the cause, and there's no reason why human will and ingenuity can't fix it.

236
00:16:27,520 --> 00:16:32,440
Countries that accept climate science are already starting to develop clean energy technologies

237
00:16:32,440 --> 00:16:37,280
that were unheard of a decade ago, and on the other side of the coin they're also becoming

238
00:16:37,280 --> 00:16:39,840
much more energy efficient.

239
00:16:39,840 --> 00:16:44,960
So much so that it's now possible to have buildings that don't use any net energy, and

240
00:16:44,960 --> 00:16:49,760
households that not only produce their own electricity but sell a surplus back to the

241
00:16:49,760 --> 00:16:51,120
grid.

242
00:16:51,120 --> 00:16:54,940
Already Denmark gets nearly a third of its electricity from wind power.

243
00:16:54,940 --> 00:17:00,640
It's possible to make gasoline from waste biomass that would otherwise rot on the ground.

244
00:17:00,640 --> 00:17:06,120
Research is going into fuel cells that can store and transport energy much more efficiently,

245
00:17:06,120 --> 00:17:10,060
and we haven't even scratched the surface of what future technologies might be able

246
00:17:10,060 --> 00:17:12,320
to achieve.

247
00:17:12,320 --> 00:17:16,960
Of course these technologies, even combined with greater energy efficiency, will never

248
00:17:16,960 --> 00:17:22,720
completely replace fossil fuels, because our energy demands are just too large.

249
00:17:22,720 --> 00:17:28,920
But they don't have to, they just have to reduce CO2 emissions and slow down the warming.

250
00:17:28,920 --> 00:17:33,120
Eventually humankind will have the technology to manage nuclear fusion, which will give

251
00:17:33,120 --> 00:17:35,700
us unlimited clean energy.

252
00:17:35,700 --> 00:17:40,080
But only if we put enough effort and resources into the research.

253
00:17:40,080 --> 00:17:41,640
And that's the problem.

254
00:17:41,640 --> 00:17:46,840
The amount we've spent on developing the world's first nuclear fusion reactor is barely two

255
00:17:46,840 --> 00:17:52,200
thirds the cost of the BP oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico three years ago.

256
00:17:52,200 --> 00:17:57,640
So no, I'm not alarmed by climate change, because we do know how to mitigate the problem

257
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:04,960
and eventually fix it if we apply our minds to it and recognise that there is a problem.

258
00:18:04,960 --> 00:18:10,480
What does alarm me is that people are so badly educated in basic science that they're willing

259
00:18:10,480 --> 00:18:15,680
to blindly believe the misleading crap they read in blogs and newspapers.

260
00:18:15,680 --> 00:18:20,720
I'm alarmed at the willingness of politicians to ignore the science because they don't understand

261
00:18:20,720 --> 00:18:24,120
it, and turn instead to their own beliefs.

262
00:18:24,120 --> 00:18:29,000
In other words, I'm not alarmed by a problem that our intelligence will allow us to mitigate.

263
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:34,080
I'm alarmed at our ignorance and gullibility that leads us to willfully ignore it.
