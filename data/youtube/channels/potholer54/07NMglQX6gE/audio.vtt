00:00.000 --> 00:04.720
I was going to do something on quotes as part of my series on science and the media, and

00:04.720 --> 00:09.800
I was particularly keen on showing a few tricks of the trade by which people can be misquoted.

00:09.800 --> 00:13.400
I wasn't quite sure how much you all knew about this already.

00:13.400 --> 00:18.140
But then two almost identical claims dropped into my message box, which made it clear that

00:18.140 --> 00:23.120
maybe these techniques aren't well understood, because the people who messaged me swore that

00:23.120 --> 00:29.300
Ben Santa, lead author of a chapter in an IPCC report in 1995, had admitted to deleting

00:29.300 --> 00:35.120
a crucial part of the report that said humans were not responsible for recent climate change.

00:35.120 --> 00:40.700
The admission came, they told me, in an interview on the Jesse Ventura conspiracy show.

00:40.700 --> 00:45.340
But it's funny, because after they gave me the link, I watched exactly the same interview

00:45.340 --> 00:47.380
and saw no such admission.

00:47.380 --> 00:48.380
Here's the clip.

00:48.380 --> 00:52.700
Lord Monckton points to deletions from the chapter, and there were deletions from the

00:52.700 --> 00:53.780
chapter.

00:53.780 --> 00:57.820
To be consistent with the other chapters, we dropped the summary at the end.

00:58.060 --> 01:02.460
Now how can we all watch the same thing and come away with a completely different understanding

01:02.460 --> 01:03.820
of what was said?

01:03.820 --> 01:06.900
Well, welcome to the wonderful world of television.

01:06.900 --> 01:12.780
After ten years of experiment, television, first shown to the public at the World's Fair,

01:12.780 --> 01:17.140
now takes its place as a new American art and industry.

01:17.140 --> 01:21.700
I guess I saw things differently, because I've conducted scores of interviews for television,

01:21.700 --> 01:25.920
so when I watch an interview now, I'm not just listening to what's said, I'm looking

01:25.920 --> 01:29.740
to see where the cuts are made and where the cameras are positioned.

01:29.740 --> 01:32.720
And it's these insights I want to share with you.

01:32.720 --> 01:37.280
But television is just one journalistic medium, so let's start with the medium I started in,

01:37.280 --> 01:39.000
which is print.

01:39.000 --> 01:43.720
And let's take this 60 Minutes interview with WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange as an example

01:43.720 --> 01:44.960
of a typical interview.

01:44.960 --> 01:50.280
There is a special set of rules in the United States for disclosing classified information.

01:50.280 --> 01:51.280
There is.

01:51.280 --> 01:52.280
There's a special...

01:52.280 --> 01:53.280
Long standing.

01:53.640 --> 02:01.800
There's a special set of rules for soldiers, for members of the State Department who are

02:01.800 --> 02:02.800
disclosing classified information.

02:02.800 --> 02:08.500
There's not a special set of rules for publishers who disclose classified information.

02:08.500 --> 02:12.920
Clearly Assange is saying that there's no special set of rules for publishers disclosing

02:12.920 --> 02:17.980
classified information, which is the argument he uses to claim that publishing leaked material

02:17.980 --> 02:20.120
is perfectly legal.

02:20.120 --> 02:23.260
Now this is how the verbatim quote actually looks.

02:23.260 --> 02:27.540
But if I was writing a story for print, this would be too long and too cumbersome to put

02:27.540 --> 02:29.520
directly into a story.

02:29.520 --> 02:34.300
So I'd cut it down to Assange's basic point and quote him like this.

02:34.300 --> 02:39.120
The ellipse shows that I've cut some words, and the parenthesis shows that I've substituted

02:39.120 --> 02:42.960
a shorter word, again without changing the meaning.

02:42.960 --> 02:47.640
If Assange saw this edited quote, he'd probably agree that it's in perfect accord with his

02:47.640 --> 02:49.740
intent and meaning.

02:49.740 --> 02:54.440
But if I was a less honest journalist working for a newspaper intent on pushing a political

02:54.440 --> 02:59.640
line, I could quite easily make a cut that changes Assange's meaning completely.

02:59.640 --> 03:03.760
And if I wanted to erase all trace of the edit I made, I wouldn't bother putting in

03:03.760 --> 03:05.160
the ellipse.

03:05.160 --> 03:09.760
This is what people would read in my newspaper, and they'd assume it's exactly what Assange

03:09.760 --> 03:10.980
said.

03:10.980 --> 03:15.580
So without knowing what the interviewee actually said, how can you spot the difference between

03:15.580 --> 03:20.520
editing that's done to save space while retaining the meaning, and dishonest editing that's

03:20.520 --> 03:22.320
done to manipulate the meaning?

03:22.320 --> 03:26.400
Well, there are lots of ways to tell from the wording, something I won't have time to

03:26.400 --> 03:27.860
go into here.

03:27.860 --> 03:31.760
But your suspicions should be aroused when an interviewee suddenly says something that

03:31.760 --> 03:35.540
completely contradicts everything he said before.

03:35.540 --> 03:40.400
For Assange to declare that publishing classified material is illegal, when for months he's

03:40.400 --> 03:43.960
been insisting it's legal, would be extraordinary.

03:43.960 --> 03:48.020
And only a journalist with a brain the size of a donut would let an admission like that

03:48.020 --> 03:51.620
slip by without pushing for more details.

03:51.620 --> 03:56.020
If Assange was doing this interview for radio, then a different technique is used.

03:56.020 --> 03:58.680
Obviously, ellipses don't work here.

03:58.680 --> 04:03.820
A long quote can simply be pieced together from bits of sentences throughout the interview.

04:03.820 --> 04:07.820
That's fine if it's done for time purposes and retains the meaning.

04:07.820 --> 04:11.080
But in unscrupulous hands, often it's not.

04:11.080 --> 04:15.940
Let's start with what Assange actually said, this time using sound editing software.

04:15.940 --> 04:24.940
There's a special set of rules for soldiers, for members of the State Department who are

04:24.940 --> 04:25.940
disclosing classified information.

04:25.940 --> 04:31.500
There's not a special set of rules for publishers who disclose classified information.

04:31.500 --> 04:37.660
Now with a bit of judicious editing, here's what we can make him say.

04:37.660 --> 04:44.020
There's a special set of rules for publishers who disclose classified information.

04:44.020 --> 04:48.920
The same sort of thing can be done with TV, but with television there's a problem.

04:48.920 --> 04:53.680
If I simply take one part of Assange's quote and paste it together with another part, the

04:53.680 --> 04:58.200
sound might be seamless, but there would be an obvious jump in the picture.

04:58.200 --> 05:04.080
There's a special set of rules for publishers who disclose classified information.

05:04.080 --> 05:08.220
Now some TV networks are okay with this, and it's an honest admission that something

05:08.220 --> 05:11.540
has been cut, just like the newspaper ellipse.

05:11.540 --> 05:15.860
But if a lot of edits have to be made, as so often happens, just to get a continuous

05:15.860 --> 05:21.140
sentence, and since television likes to cast an illusion that hates this kind of interruption,

05:21.140 --> 05:24.300
TV journalists have a trick to get around it.

05:24.300 --> 05:29.660
Now watch my dishonest edit again, this time the way it would be presented on a TV show.

05:29.660 --> 05:35.840
There's a special set of rules for publishers who disclose classified information.

05:35.840 --> 05:40.380
To the casual viewer it looks as though Assange has continued talking without a break.

05:40.380 --> 05:44.240
This is called a cutaway, or specifically a reverse.

05:44.240 --> 05:50.440
A cutaway could be anything from Assange walking in the garden to a shot of a WikiLeaks page.

05:50.440 --> 05:54.920
But the most common type of cutaway is the reverse, or what Australian TV journalists

05:54.920 --> 06:00.340
call noddies, because they're quick and easy, and make the cut less obvious.

06:00.340 --> 06:04.860
You can go to the cutaway, do the audio edit, and then come back to the interviewee and

06:04.860 --> 06:06.900
it sounds as though nothing has been skipped.

06:06.900 --> 06:13.140
There's a special set of rules for publishers who disclose classified information.

06:13.140 --> 06:17.140
But in half a second we've changed Assange's meaning completely.

06:17.140 --> 06:23.700
These reverses happen so often in TV interviews a passive viewer would hardly notice them.

06:23.700 --> 06:27.760
How many cuts can you see in this short clip from the 60 Minutes interview?

06:27.760 --> 06:29.440
What statements are you referring to?

06:29.440 --> 06:37.440
The statements by the Vice President, Biden, saying, for instance, that I was a high-tech

06:37.440 --> 06:38.840
terrorist.

06:38.840 --> 06:43.320
Sarah Palin calling to our organisation to be dealt with like the Taliban and be hunted

06:43.320 --> 06:44.320
down.

06:44.320 --> 06:49.720
There's calls either for my assassination or the assassination of my staff, or for us

06:49.720 --> 06:54.820
to be kidnapped and renditioned back to the United States to be executed.

06:54.820 --> 06:58.800
If you said three, congratulations, you'd be wrong.

06:58.800 --> 07:00.340
There were actually six.

07:00.340 --> 07:03.280
Okay, three of them were in the cutaways.

07:03.280 --> 07:07.380
The editor isn't cutting to Steve Croft here, because he's reacting to something Assange

07:07.380 --> 07:11.160
said, or because he's interjecting, or because he's got such a pretty face.

07:11.160 --> 07:13.100
We just can't get enough of it.

07:13.100 --> 07:15.280
This is an edit of the audio.

07:15.280 --> 07:18.100
But let me explain the other three.

07:18.100 --> 07:22.440
Cameras and camera crews are expensive, much more so in the past when networks used to

07:22.440 --> 07:26.720
cut costs by having just one camera focused on the interviewee.

07:26.720 --> 07:29.620
The interviewer would be filmed when the interview was over.

07:29.620 --> 07:33.880
It meant he had to sit in front of the camera, staring at nothing and looking interested,

07:33.880 --> 07:37.960
even repeating the same questions that were put during the interview, in order to get

07:37.960 --> 07:39.660
some cutaways.

07:39.660 --> 07:44.040
But these days it's common to have two cameras, and with the Assange interview, a third camera

07:44.040 --> 07:49.080
was taking a wide shot, allowing more variety in the way the cuts are made.

07:49.080 --> 07:53.920
Here we go from a close-up to a wide shot, and that's where something's been cut.

07:53.920 --> 07:57.240
When we go back to the close-up, that's another edit.

07:57.240 --> 08:01.040
This one is so obvious it can even be heard in the audio alone.

08:01.040 --> 08:06.680
Or for us to be kidnapped and renditioned back to the United States to be executed.

08:06.680 --> 08:11.060
One reason for that is that an audio recording isn't consistent throughout an interview.

08:11.060 --> 08:15.300
The tone of an interviewee's voice will change, and even the quality of the recording will

08:15.300 --> 08:19.580
change as he shifts his head slightly in relation to the microphone.

08:19.580 --> 08:24.060
Or his words might be so close together that even a precise edit will push one word too

08:24.060 --> 08:26.340
close to the edit point.

08:26.340 --> 08:30.300
That's obviously the case with the sixth edit, where the camera cuts to Assange at the end

08:30.300 --> 08:38.380
of Steve Croft's question, leaving out the first part of his opening line.

08:38.380 --> 08:42.300
So how would an unscrupulous journalist get around the problem of one word butting right

08:42.300 --> 08:44.260
up against another?

08:44.260 --> 08:48.760
Let's use another 60 Minutes interview, this time with a faster-talking Mark Zuckerberg,

08:48.760 --> 08:51.000
to see how this could be done.

08:51.000 --> 08:55.500
By the way, the cutaway here to Lesley Stahl isn't done to cut anything Zuckerberg said.

08:55.500 --> 08:57.180
It's a reaction shot.

08:57.180 --> 09:02.260
Without it, you'd just hear Stahl's reaction off-camera, which would sound a little weird.

09:02.260 --> 09:05.900
Now what I'll show you in the text are the words I want to extract from the Zuckerberg

09:05.900 --> 09:22.500
interview for my fabricated quote.

09:22.500 --> 09:26.740
So here's the clip I want to end up with, deleting a large chunk of what Zuckerberg

09:26.740 --> 09:28.340
said in between.

09:28.340 --> 09:32.140
Now if we go to the audio and make the cut I want, you can see the problem.

09:32.140 --> 09:37.140
However precisely I make the cut, one word will always butt up against another.

09:37.140 --> 09:45.280
Even with the benefit of a cutaway, you can clearly hear the edit.

09:45.280 --> 09:49.780
Most ethical networks would just let that go, just as 60 Minutes did with Assange's

09:49.780 --> 09:54.020
obvious edits, because the only way to get around it is to do something that has to be

09:54.020 --> 09:56.860
regarded as deliberately deceptive.

09:56.860 --> 10:00.740
Let's go to the Zuckerberg audio track again to see how it's done.

10:00.740 --> 10:04.380
Since the problem is that the words come too close together, I could of course just

10:04.380 --> 10:14.000
separate them with a fraction of a second's silence, a simple pause.

10:14.000 --> 10:17.580
But this sounds artificial and makes the cut even more obvious.

10:17.580 --> 10:19.380
So here's the trick.

10:19.380 --> 10:24.100
Instead of silence, we copy a pause for breath from another part of the interview and simply

10:24.100 --> 10:27.020
insert it where we made the edit.

10:27.020 --> 10:36.180
Now listen to how natural that sounds.

10:36.180 --> 10:46.400
And when we mask the audio with the cutaway, the cut is imperceptible to the casual viewer.

10:46.400 --> 10:50.900
Editing interviews and using cutaways is something every television journalist does.

10:50.900 --> 10:55.780
But every cut we make has to be weighed carefully to ensure it's done for time reasons alone

10:55.780 --> 10:59.460
and doesn't change an interviewee's intent or meaning.

10:59.460 --> 11:10.120
Which brings us back to Jesse Ventura's conspiracy programme.

11:10.120 --> 11:23.620
Look again at that Santa interview with a more practised eye.

11:23.620 --> 11:25.180
You see it now?

11:25.180 --> 11:32.660
That's right, the explanation Santa gave about the deletions was, ironically, itself deleted.

11:32.660 --> 11:36.740
Instead the programme goes to a cutaway and another part of Santa's interview is inserted

11:36.740 --> 11:38.380
in its place.

11:38.380 --> 11:42.300
If we listen to the first part of the clip before the edit, it sounds as though Santa's

11:42.300 --> 11:52.740
about to explain what the deletions were.

11:52.740 --> 11:56.620
What and what?

11:56.620 --> 11:58.660
We already know there were deletions.

11:58.660 --> 12:02.280
Santa said fifteen years ago that changes were made to the chapter.

12:02.280 --> 12:06.060
The controversy is about what those deletions were.

12:06.060 --> 12:09.940
But for some reason we don't get to hear the rest of Santa's sentence.

12:09.940 --> 12:12.940
It's um deleted.

12:12.940 --> 12:17.100
Now maybe Santa didn't go on to explain what the deletions were.

12:17.100 --> 12:20.740
But if that's the case, then why didn't the interviewer ask him?

12:20.740 --> 12:23.080
After all, that's the whole point of the interview.

12:23.080 --> 12:27.580
It's the one thing the show and its audience want to know.

12:27.580 --> 12:31.820
The result of this clever editing is that a lot of bloggers, completely oblivious to

12:31.820 --> 12:38.480
the cutaway, are quoting Santa as if this is what he actually said.

12:38.480 --> 12:43.140
And even adding things they thought he said.

12:43.140 --> 12:45.260
That's the power of television.

12:45.260 --> 12:50.320
Producers know what their target audience wants to hear and the film can be edited accordingly.

12:50.320 --> 12:55.180
If you want to make a TV series called Quest for Lost Civilizations, for example, then

12:55.180 --> 12:59.260
you really have to give your audience lost civilizations.

12:59.260 --> 13:02.000
This one I have some personal experience with.

13:02.000 --> 13:07.400
In 1999 I was asked by New Scientist magazine to investigate a strange underwater structure

13:07.400 --> 13:10.880
called the Yonaguni Monument in the western Pacific.

13:10.880 --> 13:15.360
It had featured in a television series by the author Graham Hancock, who postulated

13:15.360 --> 13:20.520
that the structure, which consists of horizontal steps and occasional holes, could be man-made.

13:20.520 --> 13:23.160
Here's how he introduced it.

13:23.160 --> 13:27.460
On the other side of the Pacific Ocean there's exciting evidence of a civilization that could

13:27.460 --> 13:31.320
have been lost in the cataclysm.

13:31.320 --> 13:36.000
It lies off the most southerly Japanese island of Yonaguni.

13:36.000 --> 13:39.480
Of course, Hancock isn't an expert, he's a journalist.

13:39.480 --> 13:48.160
So for his documentary he consulted three real experts, Egyptologist John Anthony West,

13:48.160 --> 14:02.960
geologist Dr Robert Schoch, and geologist Professor Masaaki Kimura.

14:02.960 --> 14:04.800
When do you think that man made it?

14:04.800 --> 14:12.800
Based upon the sea level change, the age is older than 9,000 years.

14:12.800 --> 14:15.720
Somewhere between 9,000 and 10,000 years?

14:15.720 --> 14:16.720
Yes.

14:16.720 --> 14:21.840
So from the film it seems the experts and amateurs agree that Yonaguni is largely man-made

14:21.840 --> 14:27.520
and built more than 9,000 years ago, thus supporting the idea of a lost civilization.

14:27.520 --> 14:29.340
Or do they?

14:29.340 --> 14:32.980
The reason I remember this story is because when it was published it caused quite a bit

14:32.980 --> 14:34.560
of consternation.

14:34.560 --> 14:39.040
Hancock complained to new scientists that my story unfairly cast doubt on the conclusion

14:39.040 --> 14:41.080
of his documentary.

14:41.080 --> 14:45.500
But as with the videos I make on this channel, I wasn't expressing my own opinion in the

14:45.500 --> 14:49.800
new scientist's story, I simply consulted two experts.

14:49.800 --> 14:55.560
Two of the same experts that Hancock had used in his film, Robert Schoch and Masaaki Kimura,

14:55.560 --> 14:59.060
and I reported what they said based on their research.

14:59.060 --> 15:02.940
Kimura told me he thought it was a natural rock formation that had been worked on by

15:02.940 --> 15:09.260
humans when it rose above sea level due to tectonic uplift, between 5 and 2,000 years

15:09.260 --> 15:10.260
ago.

15:10.260 --> 15:15.180
And he sent me a review of his book, giving an age of just over 2,000 years based on carbon

15:15.180 --> 15:16.180
dating.

15:16.180 --> 15:20.900
Schoch thought the structure was entirely natural, and that the steps and holes were

15:20.900 --> 15:22.840
erosion features.

15:22.840 --> 15:27.340
And although I didn't interview or quote John Anthony West, he had already written about

15:27.340 --> 15:33.820
the structure soon after visiting it, and also concluded that it was entirely natural.

15:33.820 --> 15:36.600
So this was quite an editing feat.

15:36.600 --> 15:40.180
Hancock consulted three experts about the Yonaguni monument.

15:40.180 --> 15:45.160
One of them thought it was most likely worked on by humans a little over 2,000 years ago,

15:45.160 --> 15:48.700
and two of them thought the structure was entirely natural.

15:48.700 --> 15:51.940
Yet none of this expert opinion was conveyed to the viewer.

15:51.940 --> 15:57.500
Instead, we're led exclusively to Hancock's conclusion that Yonaguni was probably carved

15:57.500 --> 16:00.820
12,000 years ago by a lost civilization.

16:00.820 --> 16:07.460
Its presence here suggests a very sophisticated civilization at an impossibly early date.

16:07.460 --> 16:11.780
But one thing, didn't we hear Kimura tell Hancock quite clearly that humans made this

16:11.780 --> 16:14.180
structure more than 9,000 years ago?

16:14.180 --> 16:16.180
Actually, no.

16:16.180 --> 16:18.060
When do you think that men made it?

16:18.060 --> 16:26.060
Based upon the sea level change, the age is older than 9,000 years.

16:26.060 --> 16:28.660
Somewhere between 9,000 and 10,000 years?

16:28.660 --> 16:29.660
Yes.

16:29.660 --> 16:31.980
The question put by Hancock was...

16:31.980 --> 16:33.460
When do you think that men made it?

16:33.460 --> 16:38.140
We then cut to something rather fuzzy from Kimura about sea level change, and then we

16:38.140 --> 16:44.380
see another cut, and Kimura talking about something being older than 9,000 years.

16:44.380 --> 16:46.140
Then Hancock adds another date.

16:46.140 --> 16:48.860
Somewhere between 9,000 and 10,000 years?

16:48.860 --> 16:49.860
Yes.

16:49.860 --> 16:54.580
Whatever we think we heard, a lot is obviously missing between the question at the beginning

16:54.580 --> 16:56.900
and the answer at the end.

16:56.900 --> 17:01.420
If I ask people whether they trust what they see on television, I usually get a resounding

17:01.420 --> 17:02.880
no.

17:02.880 --> 17:07.500
Everyone seems to know that most television programs are in the business of entertainment.

17:07.500 --> 17:11.460
Everyone knows TV producers can make you think you've seen something that never happened

17:11.460 --> 17:13.980
or heard something that wasn't said.

17:13.980 --> 17:18.060
Yes, we all know it, but boy, we still fall for it.
