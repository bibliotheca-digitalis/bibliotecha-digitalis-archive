1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,720
I was going to do something on quotes as part of my series on science and the media, and

2
00:00:04,720 --> 00:00:09,800
I was particularly keen on showing a few tricks of the trade by which people can be misquoted.

3
00:00:09,800 --> 00:00:13,400
I wasn't quite sure how much you all knew about this already.

4
00:00:13,400 --> 00:00:18,140
But then two almost identical claims dropped into my message box, which made it clear that

5
00:00:18,140 --> 00:00:23,120
maybe these techniques aren't well understood, because the people who messaged me swore that

6
00:00:23,120 --> 00:00:29,300
Ben Santa, lead author of a chapter in an IPCC report in 1995, had admitted to deleting

7
00:00:29,300 --> 00:00:35,120
a crucial part of the report that said humans were not responsible for recent climate change.

8
00:00:35,120 --> 00:00:40,700
The admission came, they told me, in an interview on the Jesse Ventura conspiracy show.

9
00:00:40,700 --> 00:00:45,340
But it's funny, because after they gave me the link, I watched exactly the same interview

10
00:00:45,340 --> 00:00:47,380
and saw no such admission.

11
00:00:47,380 --> 00:00:48,380
Here's the clip.

12
00:00:48,380 --> 00:00:52,700
Lord Monckton points to deletions from the chapter, and there were deletions from the

13
00:00:52,700 --> 00:00:53,780
chapter.

14
00:00:53,780 --> 00:00:57,820
To be consistent with the other chapters, we dropped the summary at the end.

15
00:00:58,060 --> 00:01:02,460
Now how can we all watch the same thing and come away with a completely different understanding

16
00:01:02,460 --> 00:01:03,820
of what was said?

17
00:01:03,820 --> 00:01:06,900
Well, welcome to the wonderful world of television.

18
00:01:06,900 --> 00:01:12,780
After ten years of experiment, television, first shown to the public at the World's Fair,

19
00:01:12,780 --> 00:01:17,140
now takes its place as a new American art and industry.

20
00:01:17,140 --> 00:01:21,700
I guess I saw things differently, because I've conducted scores of interviews for television,

21
00:01:21,700 --> 00:01:25,920
so when I watch an interview now, I'm not just listening to what's said, I'm looking

22
00:01:25,920 --> 00:01:29,740
to see where the cuts are made and where the cameras are positioned.

23
00:01:29,740 --> 00:01:32,720
And it's these insights I want to share with you.

24
00:01:32,720 --> 00:01:37,280
But television is just one journalistic medium, so let's start with the medium I started in,

25
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:39,000
which is print.

26
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:43,720
And let's take this 60 Minutes interview with WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange as an example

27
00:01:43,720 --> 00:01:44,960
of a typical interview.

28
00:01:44,960 --> 00:01:50,280
There is a special set of rules in the United States for disclosing classified information.

29
00:01:50,280 --> 00:01:51,280
There is.

30
00:01:51,280 --> 00:01:52,280
There's a special...

31
00:01:52,280 --> 00:01:53,280
Long standing.

32
00:01:53,640 --> 00:02:01,800
There's a special set of rules for soldiers, for members of the State Department who are

33
00:02:01,800 --> 00:02:02,800
disclosing classified information.

34
00:02:02,800 --> 00:02:08,500
There's not a special set of rules for publishers who disclose classified information.

35
00:02:08,500 --> 00:02:12,920
Clearly Assange is saying that there's no special set of rules for publishers disclosing

36
00:02:12,920 --> 00:02:17,980
classified information, which is the argument he uses to claim that publishing leaked material

37
00:02:17,980 --> 00:02:20,120
is perfectly legal.

38
00:02:20,120 --> 00:02:23,260
Now this is how the verbatim quote actually looks.

39
00:02:23,260 --> 00:02:27,540
But if I was writing a story for print, this would be too long and too cumbersome to put

40
00:02:27,540 --> 00:02:29,520
directly into a story.

41
00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:34,300
So I'd cut it down to Assange's basic point and quote him like this.

42
00:02:34,300 --> 00:02:39,120
The ellipse shows that I've cut some words, and the parenthesis shows that I've substituted

43
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:42,960
a shorter word, again without changing the meaning.

44
00:02:42,960 --> 00:02:47,640
If Assange saw this edited quote, he'd probably agree that it's in perfect accord with his

45
00:02:47,640 --> 00:02:49,740
intent and meaning.

46
00:02:49,740 --> 00:02:54,440
But if I was a less honest journalist working for a newspaper intent on pushing a political

47
00:02:54,440 --> 00:02:59,640
line, I could quite easily make a cut that changes Assange's meaning completely.

48
00:02:59,640 --> 00:03:03,760
And if I wanted to erase all trace of the edit I made, I wouldn't bother putting in

49
00:03:03,760 --> 00:03:05,160
the ellipse.

50
00:03:05,160 --> 00:03:09,760
This is what people would read in my newspaper, and they'd assume it's exactly what Assange

51
00:03:09,760 --> 00:03:10,980
said.

52
00:03:10,980 --> 00:03:15,580
So without knowing what the interviewee actually said, how can you spot the difference between

53
00:03:15,580 --> 00:03:20,520
editing that's done to save space while retaining the meaning, and dishonest editing that's

54
00:03:20,520 --> 00:03:22,320
done to manipulate the meaning?

55
00:03:22,320 --> 00:03:26,400
Well, there are lots of ways to tell from the wording, something I won't have time to

56
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:27,860
go into here.

57
00:03:27,860 --> 00:03:31,760
But your suspicions should be aroused when an interviewee suddenly says something that

58
00:03:31,760 --> 00:03:35,540
completely contradicts everything he said before.

59
00:03:35,540 --> 00:03:40,400
For Assange to declare that publishing classified material is illegal, when for months he's

60
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:43,960
been insisting it's legal, would be extraordinary.

61
00:03:43,960 --> 00:03:48,020
And only a journalist with a brain the size of a donut would let an admission like that

62
00:03:48,020 --> 00:03:51,620
slip by without pushing for more details.

63
00:03:51,620 --> 00:03:56,020
If Assange was doing this interview for radio, then a different technique is used.

64
00:03:56,020 --> 00:03:58,680
Obviously, ellipses don't work here.

65
00:03:58,680 --> 00:04:03,820
A long quote can simply be pieced together from bits of sentences throughout the interview.

66
00:04:03,820 --> 00:04:07,820
That's fine if it's done for time purposes and retains the meaning.

67
00:04:07,820 --> 00:04:11,080
But in unscrupulous hands, often it's not.

68
00:04:11,080 --> 00:04:15,940
Let's start with what Assange actually said, this time using sound editing software.

69
00:04:15,940 --> 00:04:24,940
There's a special set of rules for soldiers, for members of the State Department who are

70
00:04:24,940 --> 00:04:25,940
disclosing classified information.

71
00:04:25,940 --> 00:04:31,500
There's not a special set of rules for publishers who disclose classified information.

72
00:04:31,500 --> 00:04:37,660
Now with a bit of judicious editing, here's what we can make him say.

73
00:04:37,660 --> 00:04:44,020
There's a special set of rules for publishers who disclose classified information.

74
00:04:44,020 --> 00:04:48,920
The same sort of thing can be done with TV, but with television there's a problem.

75
00:04:48,920 --> 00:04:53,680
If I simply take one part of Assange's quote and paste it together with another part, the

76
00:04:53,680 --> 00:04:58,200
sound might be seamless, but there would be an obvious jump in the picture.

77
00:04:58,200 --> 00:05:04,080
There's a special set of rules for publishers who disclose classified information.

78
00:05:04,080 --> 00:05:08,220
Now some TV networks are okay with this, and it's an honest admission that something

79
00:05:08,220 --> 00:05:11,540
has been cut, just like the newspaper ellipse.

80
00:05:11,540 --> 00:05:15,860
But if a lot of edits have to be made, as so often happens, just to get a continuous

81
00:05:15,860 --> 00:05:21,140
sentence, and since television likes to cast an illusion that hates this kind of interruption,

82
00:05:21,140 --> 00:05:24,300
TV journalists have a trick to get around it.

83
00:05:24,300 --> 00:05:29,660
Now watch my dishonest edit again, this time the way it would be presented on a TV show.

84
00:05:29,660 --> 00:05:35,840
There's a special set of rules for publishers who disclose classified information.

85
00:05:35,840 --> 00:05:40,380
To the casual viewer it looks as though Assange has continued talking without a break.

86
00:05:40,380 --> 00:05:44,240
This is called a cutaway, or specifically a reverse.

87
00:05:44,240 --> 00:05:50,440
A cutaway could be anything from Assange walking in the garden to a shot of a WikiLeaks page.

88
00:05:50,440 --> 00:05:54,920
But the most common type of cutaway is the reverse, or what Australian TV journalists

89
00:05:54,920 --> 00:06:00,340
call noddies, because they're quick and easy, and make the cut less obvious.

90
00:06:00,340 --> 00:06:04,860
You can go to the cutaway, do the audio edit, and then come back to the interviewee and

91
00:06:04,860 --> 00:06:06,900
it sounds as though nothing has been skipped.

92
00:06:06,900 --> 00:06:13,140
There's a special set of rules for publishers who disclose classified information.

93
00:06:13,140 --> 00:06:17,140
But in half a second we've changed Assange's meaning completely.

94
00:06:17,140 --> 00:06:23,700
These reverses happen so often in TV interviews a passive viewer would hardly notice them.

95
00:06:23,700 --> 00:06:27,760
How many cuts can you see in this short clip from the 60 Minutes interview?

96
00:06:27,760 --> 00:06:29,440
What statements are you referring to?

97
00:06:29,440 --> 00:06:37,440
The statements by the Vice President, Biden, saying, for instance, that I was a high-tech

98
00:06:37,440 --> 00:06:38,840
terrorist.

99
00:06:38,840 --> 00:06:43,320
Sarah Palin calling to our organisation to be dealt with like the Taliban and be hunted

100
00:06:43,320 --> 00:06:44,320
down.

101
00:06:44,320 --> 00:06:49,720
There's calls either for my assassination or the assassination of my staff, or for us

102
00:06:49,720 --> 00:06:54,820
to be kidnapped and renditioned back to the United States to be executed.

103
00:06:54,820 --> 00:06:58,800
If you said three, congratulations, you'd be wrong.

104
00:06:58,800 --> 00:07:00,340
There were actually six.

105
00:07:00,340 --> 00:07:03,280
Okay, three of them were in the cutaways.

106
00:07:03,280 --> 00:07:07,380
The editor isn't cutting to Steve Croft here, because he's reacting to something Assange

107
00:07:07,380 --> 00:07:11,160
said, or because he's interjecting, or because he's got such a pretty face.

108
00:07:11,160 --> 00:07:13,100
We just can't get enough of it.

109
00:07:13,100 --> 00:07:15,280
This is an edit of the audio.

110
00:07:15,280 --> 00:07:18,100
But let me explain the other three.

111
00:07:18,100 --> 00:07:22,440
Cameras and camera crews are expensive, much more so in the past when networks used to

112
00:07:22,440 --> 00:07:26,720
cut costs by having just one camera focused on the interviewee.

113
00:07:26,720 --> 00:07:29,620
The interviewer would be filmed when the interview was over.

114
00:07:29,620 --> 00:07:33,880
It meant he had to sit in front of the camera, staring at nothing and looking interested,

115
00:07:33,880 --> 00:07:37,960
even repeating the same questions that were put during the interview, in order to get

116
00:07:37,960 --> 00:07:39,660
some cutaways.

117
00:07:39,660 --> 00:07:44,040
But these days it's common to have two cameras, and with the Assange interview, a third camera

118
00:07:44,040 --> 00:07:49,080
was taking a wide shot, allowing more variety in the way the cuts are made.

119
00:07:49,080 --> 00:07:53,920
Here we go from a close-up to a wide shot, and that's where something's been cut.

120
00:07:53,920 --> 00:07:57,240
When we go back to the close-up, that's another edit.

121
00:07:57,240 --> 00:08:01,040
This one is so obvious it can even be heard in the audio alone.

122
00:08:01,040 --> 00:08:06,680
Or for us to be kidnapped and renditioned back to the United States to be executed.

123
00:08:06,680 --> 00:08:11,060
One reason for that is that an audio recording isn't consistent throughout an interview.

124
00:08:11,060 --> 00:08:15,300
The tone of an interviewee's voice will change, and even the quality of the recording will

125
00:08:15,300 --> 00:08:19,580
change as he shifts his head slightly in relation to the microphone.

126
00:08:19,580 --> 00:08:24,060
Or his words might be so close together that even a precise edit will push one word too

127
00:08:24,060 --> 00:08:26,340
close to the edit point.

128
00:08:26,340 --> 00:08:30,300
That's obviously the case with the sixth edit, where the camera cuts to Assange at the end

129
00:08:30,300 --> 00:08:38,380
of Steve Croft's question, leaving out the first part of his opening line.

130
00:08:38,380 --> 00:08:42,300
So how would an unscrupulous journalist get around the problem of one word butting right

131
00:08:42,300 --> 00:08:44,260
up against another?

132
00:08:44,260 --> 00:08:48,760
Let's use another 60 Minutes interview, this time with a faster-talking Mark Zuckerberg,

133
00:08:48,760 --> 00:08:51,000
to see how this could be done.

134
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:55,500
By the way, the cutaway here to Lesley Stahl isn't done to cut anything Zuckerberg said.

135
00:08:55,500 --> 00:08:57,180
It's a reaction shot.

136
00:08:57,180 --> 00:09:02,260
Without it, you'd just hear Stahl's reaction off-camera, which would sound a little weird.

137
00:09:02,260 --> 00:09:05,900
Now what I'll show you in the text are the words I want to extract from the Zuckerberg

138
00:09:05,900 --> 00:09:22,500
interview for my fabricated quote.

139
00:09:22,500 --> 00:09:26,740
So here's the clip I want to end up with, deleting a large chunk of what Zuckerberg

140
00:09:26,740 --> 00:09:28,340
said in between.

141
00:09:28,340 --> 00:09:32,140
Now if we go to the audio and make the cut I want, you can see the problem.

142
00:09:32,140 --> 00:09:37,140
However precisely I make the cut, one word will always butt up against another.

143
00:09:37,140 --> 00:09:45,280
Even with the benefit of a cutaway, you can clearly hear the edit.

144
00:09:45,280 --> 00:09:49,780
Most ethical networks would just let that go, just as 60 Minutes did with Assange's

145
00:09:49,780 --> 00:09:54,020
obvious edits, because the only way to get around it is to do something that has to be

146
00:09:54,020 --> 00:09:56,860
regarded as deliberately deceptive.

147
00:09:56,860 --> 00:10:00,740
Let's go to the Zuckerberg audio track again to see how it's done.

148
00:10:00,740 --> 00:10:04,380
Since the problem is that the words come too close together, I could of course just

149
00:10:04,380 --> 00:10:14,000
separate them with a fraction of a second's silence, a simple pause.

150
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:17,580
But this sounds artificial and makes the cut even more obvious.

151
00:10:17,580 --> 00:10:19,380
So here's the trick.

152
00:10:19,380 --> 00:10:24,100
Instead of silence, we copy a pause for breath from another part of the interview and simply

153
00:10:24,100 --> 00:10:27,020
insert it where we made the edit.

154
00:10:27,020 --> 00:10:36,180
Now listen to how natural that sounds.

155
00:10:36,180 --> 00:10:46,400
And when we mask the audio with the cutaway, the cut is imperceptible to the casual viewer.

156
00:10:46,400 --> 00:10:50,900
Editing interviews and using cutaways is something every television journalist does.

157
00:10:50,900 --> 00:10:55,780
But every cut we make has to be weighed carefully to ensure it's done for time reasons alone

158
00:10:55,780 --> 00:10:59,460
and doesn't change an interviewee's intent or meaning.

159
00:10:59,460 --> 00:11:10,120
Which brings us back to Jesse Ventura's conspiracy programme.

160
00:11:10,120 --> 00:11:23,620
Look again at that Santa interview with a more practised eye.

161
00:11:23,620 --> 00:11:25,180
You see it now?

162
00:11:25,180 --> 00:11:32,660
That's right, the explanation Santa gave about the deletions was, ironically, itself deleted.

163
00:11:32,660 --> 00:11:36,740
Instead the programme goes to a cutaway and another part of Santa's interview is inserted

164
00:11:36,740 --> 00:11:38,380
in its place.

165
00:11:38,380 --> 00:11:42,300
If we listen to the first part of the clip before the edit, it sounds as though Santa's

166
00:11:42,300 --> 00:11:52,740
about to explain what the deletions were.

167
00:11:52,740 --> 00:11:56,620
What and what?

168
00:11:56,620 --> 00:11:58,660
We already know there were deletions.

169
00:11:58,660 --> 00:12:02,280
Santa said fifteen years ago that changes were made to the chapter.

170
00:12:02,280 --> 00:12:06,060
The controversy is about what those deletions were.

171
00:12:06,060 --> 00:12:09,940
But for some reason we don't get to hear the rest of Santa's sentence.

172
00:12:09,940 --> 00:12:12,940
It's um deleted.

173
00:12:12,940 --> 00:12:17,100
Now maybe Santa didn't go on to explain what the deletions were.

174
00:12:17,100 --> 00:12:20,740
But if that's the case, then why didn't the interviewer ask him?

175
00:12:20,740 --> 00:12:23,080
After all, that's the whole point of the interview.

176
00:12:23,080 --> 00:12:27,580
It's the one thing the show and its audience want to know.

177
00:12:27,580 --> 00:12:31,820
The result of this clever editing is that a lot of bloggers, completely oblivious to

178
00:12:31,820 --> 00:12:38,480
the cutaway, are quoting Santa as if this is what he actually said.

179
00:12:38,480 --> 00:12:43,140
And even adding things they thought he said.

180
00:12:43,140 --> 00:12:45,260
That's the power of television.

181
00:12:45,260 --> 00:12:50,320
Producers know what their target audience wants to hear and the film can be edited accordingly.

182
00:12:50,320 --> 00:12:55,180
If you want to make a TV series called Quest for Lost Civilizations, for example, then

183
00:12:55,180 --> 00:12:59,260
you really have to give your audience lost civilizations.

184
00:12:59,260 --> 00:13:02,000
This one I have some personal experience with.

185
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:07,400
In 1999 I was asked by New Scientist magazine to investigate a strange underwater structure

186
00:13:07,400 --> 00:13:10,880
called the Yonaguni Monument in the western Pacific.

187
00:13:10,880 --> 00:13:15,360
It had featured in a television series by the author Graham Hancock, who postulated

188
00:13:15,360 --> 00:13:20,520
that the structure, which consists of horizontal steps and occasional holes, could be man-made.

189
00:13:20,520 --> 00:13:23,160
Here's how he introduced it.

190
00:13:23,160 --> 00:13:27,460
On the other side of the Pacific Ocean there's exciting evidence of a civilization that could

191
00:13:27,460 --> 00:13:31,320
have been lost in the cataclysm.

192
00:13:31,320 --> 00:13:36,000
It lies off the most southerly Japanese island of Yonaguni.

193
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:39,480
Of course, Hancock isn't an expert, he's a journalist.

194
00:13:39,480 --> 00:13:48,160
So for his documentary he consulted three real experts, Egyptologist John Anthony West,

195
00:13:48,160 --> 00:14:02,960
geologist Dr Robert Schoch, and geologist Professor Masaaki Kimura.

196
00:14:02,960 --> 00:14:04,800
When do you think that man made it?

197
00:14:04,800 --> 00:14:12,800
Based upon the sea level change, the age is older than 9,000 years.

198
00:14:12,800 --> 00:14:15,720
Somewhere between 9,000 and 10,000 years?

199
00:14:15,720 --> 00:14:16,720
Yes.

200
00:14:16,720 --> 00:14:21,840
So from the film it seems the experts and amateurs agree that Yonaguni is largely man-made

201
00:14:21,840 --> 00:14:27,520
and built more than 9,000 years ago, thus supporting the idea of a lost civilization.

202
00:14:27,520 --> 00:14:29,340
Or do they?

203
00:14:29,340 --> 00:14:32,980
The reason I remember this story is because when it was published it caused quite a bit

204
00:14:32,980 --> 00:14:34,560
of consternation.

205
00:14:34,560 --> 00:14:39,040
Hancock complained to new scientists that my story unfairly cast doubt on the conclusion

206
00:14:39,040 --> 00:14:41,080
of his documentary.

207
00:14:41,080 --> 00:14:45,500
But as with the videos I make on this channel, I wasn't expressing my own opinion in the

208
00:14:45,500 --> 00:14:49,800
new scientist's story, I simply consulted two experts.

209
00:14:49,800 --> 00:14:55,560
Two of the same experts that Hancock had used in his film, Robert Schoch and Masaaki Kimura,

210
00:14:55,560 --> 00:14:59,060
and I reported what they said based on their research.

211
00:14:59,060 --> 00:15:02,940
Kimura told me he thought it was a natural rock formation that had been worked on by

212
00:15:02,940 --> 00:15:09,260
humans when it rose above sea level due to tectonic uplift, between 5 and 2,000 years

213
00:15:09,260 --> 00:15:10,260
ago.

214
00:15:10,260 --> 00:15:15,180
And he sent me a review of his book, giving an age of just over 2,000 years based on carbon

215
00:15:15,180 --> 00:15:16,180
dating.

216
00:15:16,180 --> 00:15:20,900
Schoch thought the structure was entirely natural, and that the steps and holes were

217
00:15:20,900 --> 00:15:22,840
erosion features.

218
00:15:22,840 --> 00:15:27,340
And although I didn't interview or quote John Anthony West, he had already written about

219
00:15:27,340 --> 00:15:33,820
the structure soon after visiting it, and also concluded that it was entirely natural.

220
00:15:33,820 --> 00:15:36,600
So this was quite an editing feat.

221
00:15:36,600 --> 00:15:40,180
Hancock consulted three experts about the Yonaguni monument.

222
00:15:40,180 --> 00:15:45,160
One of them thought it was most likely worked on by humans a little over 2,000 years ago,

223
00:15:45,160 --> 00:15:48,700
and two of them thought the structure was entirely natural.

224
00:15:48,700 --> 00:15:51,940
Yet none of this expert opinion was conveyed to the viewer.

225
00:15:51,940 --> 00:15:57,500
Instead, we're led exclusively to Hancock's conclusion that Yonaguni was probably carved

226
00:15:57,500 --> 00:16:00,820
12,000 years ago by a lost civilization.

227
00:16:00,820 --> 00:16:07,460
Its presence here suggests a very sophisticated civilization at an impossibly early date.

228
00:16:07,460 --> 00:16:11,780
But one thing, didn't we hear Kimura tell Hancock quite clearly that humans made this

229
00:16:11,780 --> 00:16:14,180
structure more than 9,000 years ago?

230
00:16:14,180 --> 00:16:16,180
Actually, no.

231
00:16:16,180 --> 00:16:18,060
When do you think that men made it?

232
00:16:18,060 --> 00:16:26,060
Based upon the sea level change, the age is older than 9,000 years.

233
00:16:26,060 --> 00:16:28,660
Somewhere between 9,000 and 10,000 years?

234
00:16:28,660 --> 00:16:29,660
Yes.

235
00:16:29,660 --> 00:16:31,980
The question put by Hancock was...

236
00:16:31,980 --> 00:16:33,460
When do you think that men made it?

237
00:16:33,460 --> 00:16:38,140
We then cut to something rather fuzzy from Kimura about sea level change, and then we

238
00:16:38,140 --> 00:16:44,380
see another cut, and Kimura talking about something being older than 9,000 years.

239
00:16:44,380 --> 00:16:46,140
Then Hancock adds another date.

240
00:16:46,140 --> 00:16:48,860
Somewhere between 9,000 and 10,000 years?

241
00:16:48,860 --> 00:16:49,860
Yes.

242
00:16:49,860 --> 00:16:54,580
Whatever we think we heard, a lot is obviously missing between the question at the beginning

243
00:16:54,580 --> 00:16:56,900
and the answer at the end.

244
00:16:56,900 --> 00:17:01,420
If I ask people whether they trust what they see on television, I usually get a resounding

245
00:17:01,420 --> 00:17:02,880
no.

246
00:17:02,880 --> 00:17:07,500
Everyone seems to know that most television programs are in the business of entertainment.

247
00:17:07,500 --> 00:17:11,460
Everyone knows TV producers can make you think you've seen something that never happened

248
00:17:11,460 --> 00:17:13,980
or heard something that wasn't said.

249
00:17:13,980 --> 00:17:18,060
Yes, we all know it, but boy, we still fall for it.
