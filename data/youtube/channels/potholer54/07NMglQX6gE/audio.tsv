0	4720	I was going to do something on quotes as part of my series on science and the media, and
4720	9800	I was particularly keen on showing a few tricks of the trade by which people can be misquoted.
9800	13400	I wasn't quite sure how much you all knew about this already.
13400	18140	But then two almost identical claims dropped into my message box, which made it clear that
18140	23120	maybe these techniques aren't well understood, because the people who messaged me swore that
23120	29300	Ben Santa, lead author of a chapter in an IPCC report in 1995, had admitted to deleting
29300	35120	a crucial part of the report that said humans were not responsible for recent climate change.
35120	40700	The admission came, they told me, in an interview on the Jesse Ventura conspiracy show.
40700	45340	But it's funny, because after they gave me the link, I watched exactly the same interview
45340	47380	and saw no such admission.
47380	48380	Here's the clip.
48380	52700	Lord Monckton points to deletions from the chapter, and there were deletions from the
52700	53780	chapter.
53780	57820	To be consistent with the other chapters, we dropped the summary at the end.
58060	62460	Now how can we all watch the same thing and come away with a completely different understanding
62460	63820	of what was said?
63820	66900	Well, welcome to the wonderful world of television.
66900	72780	After ten years of experiment, television, first shown to the public at the World's Fair,
72780	77140	now takes its place as a new American art and industry.
77140	81700	I guess I saw things differently, because I've conducted scores of interviews for television,
81700	85920	so when I watch an interview now, I'm not just listening to what's said, I'm looking
85920	89740	to see where the cuts are made and where the cameras are positioned.
89740	92720	And it's these insights I want to share with you.
92720	97280	But television is just one journalistic medium, so let's start with the medium I started in,
97280	99000	which is print.
99000	103720	And let's take this 60 Minutes interview with WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange as an example
103720	104960	of a typical interview.
104960	110280	There is a special set of rules in the United States for disclosing classified information.
110280	111280	There is.
111280	112280	There's a special...
112280	113280	Long standing.
113640	121800	There's a special set of rules for soldiers, for members of the State Department who are
121800	122800	disclosing classified information.
122800	128500	There's not a special set of rules for publishers who disclose classified information.
128500	132920	Clearly Assange is saying that there's no special set of rules for publishers disclosing
132920	137980	classified information, which is the argument he uses to claim that publishing leaked material
137980	140120	is perfectly legal.
140120	143260	Now this is how the verbatim quote actually looks.
143260	147540	But if I was writing a story for print, this would be too long and too cumbersome to put
147540	149520	directly into a story.
149520	154300	So I'd cut it down to Assange's basic point and quote him like this.
154300	159120	The ellipse shows that I've cut some words, and the parenthesis shows that I've substituted
159120	162960	a shorter word, again without changing the meaning.
162960	167640	If Assange saw this edited quote, he'd probably agree that it's in perfect accord with his
167640	169740	intent and meaning.
169740	174440	But if I was a less honest journalist working for a newspaper intent on pushing a political
174440	179640	line, I could quite easily make a cut that changes Assange's meaning completely.
179640	183760	And if I wanted to erase all trace of the edit I made, I wouldn't bother putting in
183760	185160	the ellipse.
185160	189760	This is what people would read in my newspaper, and they'd assume it's exactly what Assange
189760	190980	said.
190980	195580	So without knowing what the interviewee actually said, how can you spot the difference between
195580	200520	editing that's done to save space while retaining the meaning, and dishonest editing that's
200520	202320	done to manipulate the meaning?
202320	206400	Well, there are lots of ways to tell from the wording, something I won't have time to
206400	207860	go into here.
207860	211760	But your suspicions should be aroused when an interviewee suddenly says something that
211760	215540	completely contradicts everything he said before.
215540	220400	For Assange to declare that publishing classified material is illegal, when for months he's
220400	223960	been insisting it's legal, would be extraordinary.
223960	228020	And only a journalist with a brain the size of a donut would let an admission like that
228020	231620	slip by without pushing for more details.
231620	236020	If Assange was doing this interview for radio, then a different technique is used.
236020	238680	Obviously, ellipses don't work here.
238680	243820	A long quote can simply be pieced together from bits of sentences throughout the interview.
243820	247820	That's fine if it's done for time purposes and retains the meaning.
247820	251080	But in unscrupulous hands, often it's not.
251080	255940	Let's start with what Assange actually said, this time using sound editing software.
255940	264940	There's a special set of rules for soldiers, for members of the State Department who are
264940	265940	disclosing classified information.
265940	271500	There's not a special set of rules for publishers who disclose classified information.
271500	277660	Now with a bit of judicious editing, here's what we can make him say.
277660	284020	There's a special set of rules for publishers who disclose classified information.
284020	288920	The same sort of thing can be done with TV, but with television there's a problem.
288920	293680	If I simply take one part of Assange's quote and paste it together with another part, the
293680	298200	sound might be seamless, but there would be an obvious jump in the picture.
298200	304080	There's a special set of rules for publishers who disclose classified information.
304080	308220	Now some TV networks are okay with this, and it's an honest admission that something
308220	311540	has been cut, just like the newspaper ellipse.
311540	315860	But if a lot of edits have to be made, as so often happens, just to get a continuous
315860	321140	sentence, and since television likes to cast an illusion that hates this kind of interruption,
321140	324300	TV journalists have a trick to get around it.
324300	329660	Now watch my dishonest edit again, this time the way it would be presented on a TV show.
329660	335840	There's a special set of rules for publishers who disclose classified information.
335840	340380	To the casual viewer it looks as though Assange has continued talking without a break.
340380	344240	This is called a cutaway, or specifically a reverse.
344240	350440	A cutaway could be anything from Assange walking in the garden to a shot of a WikiLeaks page.
350440	354920	But the most common type of cutaway is the reverse, or what Australian TV journalists
354920	360340	call noddies, because they're quick and easy, and make the cut less obvious.
360340	364860	You can go to the cutaway, do the audio edit, and then come back to the interviewee and
364860	366900	it sounds as though nothing has been skipped.
366900	373140	There's a special set of rules for publishers who disclose classified information.
373140	377140	But in half a second we've changed Assange's meaning completely.
377140	383700	These reverses happen so often in TV interviews a passive viewer would hardly notice them.
383700	387760	How many cuts can you see in this short clip from the 60 Minutes interview?
387760	389440	What statements are you referring to?
389440	397440	The statements by the Vice President, Biden, saying, for instance, that I was a high-tech
397440	398840	terrorist.
398840	403320	Sarah Palin calling to our organisation to be dealt with like the Taliban and be hunted
403320	404320	down.
404320	409720	There's calls either for my assassination or the assassination of my staff, or for us
409720	414820	to be kidnapped and renditioned back to the United States to be executed.
414820	418800	If you said three, congratulations, you'd be wrong.
418800	420340	There were actually six.
420340	423280	Okay, three of them were in the cutaways.
423280	427380	The editor isn't cutting to Steve Croft here, because he's reacting to something Assange
427380	431160	said, or because he's interjecting, or because he's got such a pretty face.
431160	433100	We just can't get enough of it.
433100	435280	This is an edit of the audio.
435280	438100	But let me explain the other three.
438100	442440	Cameras and camera crews are expensive, much more so in the past when networks used to
442440	446720	cut costs by having just one camera focused on the interviewee.
446720	449620	The interviewer would be filmed when the interview was over.
449620	453880	It meant he had to sit in front of the camera, staring at nothing and looking interested,
453880	457960	even repeating the same questions that were put during the interview, in order to get
457960	459660	some cutaways.
459660	464040	But these days it's common to have two cameras, and with the Assange interview, a third camera
464040	469080	was taking a wide shot, allowing more variety in the way the cuts are made.
469080	473920	Here we go from a close-up to a wide shot, and that's where something's been cut.
473920	477240	When we go back to the close-up, that's another edit.
477240	481040	This one is so obvious it can even be heard in the audio alone.
481040	486680	Or for us to be kidnapped and renditioned back to the United States to be executed.
486680	491060	One reason for that is that an audio recording isn't consistent throughout an interview.
491060	495300	The tone of an interviewee's voice will change, and even the quality of the recording will
495300	499580	change as he shifts his head slightly in relation to the microphone.
499580	504060	Or his words might be so close together that even a precise edit will push one word too
504060	506340	close to the edit point.
506340	510300	That's obviously the case with the sixth edit, where the camera cuts to Assange at the end
510300	518380	of Steve Croft's question, leaving out the first part of his opening line.
518380	522300	So how would an unscrupulous journalist get around the problem of one word butting right
522300	524260	up against another?
524260	528760	Let's use another 60 Minutes interview, this time with a faster-talking Mark Zuckerberg,
528760	531000	to see how this could be done.
531000	535500	By the way, the cutaway here to Lesley Stahl isn't done to cut anything Zuckerberg said.
535500	537180	It's a reaction shot.
537180	542260	Without it, you'd just hear Stahl's reaction off-camera, which would sound a little weird.
542260	545900	Now what I'll show you in the text are the words I want to extract from the Zuckerberg
545900	562500	interview for my fabricated quote.
562500	566740	So here's the clip I want to end up with, deleting a large chunk of what Zuckerberg
566740	568340	said in between.
568340	572140	Now if we go to the audio and make the cut I want, you can see the problem.
572140	577140	However precisely I make the cut, one word will always butt up against another.
577140	585280	Even with the benefit of a cutaway, you can clearly hear the edit.
585280	589780	Most ethical networks would just let that go, just as 60 Minutes did with Assange's
589780	594020	obvious edits, because the only way to get around it is to do something that has to be
594020	596860	regarded as deliberately deceptive.
596860	600740	Let's go to the Zuckerberg audio track again to see how it's done.
600740	604380	Since the problem is that the words come too close together, I could of course just
604380	614000	separate them with a fraction of a second's silence, a simple pause.
614000	617580	But this sounds artificial and makes the cut even more obvious.
617580	619380	So here's the trick.
619380	624100	Instead of silence, we copy a pause for breath from another part of the interview and simply
624100	627020	insert it where we made the edit.
627020	636180	Now listen to how natural that sounds.
636180	646400	And when we mask the audio with the cutaway, the cut is imperceptible to the casual viewer.
646400	650900	Editing interviews and using cutaways is something every television journalist does.
650900	655780	But every cut we make has to be weighed carefully to ensure it's done for time reasons alone
655780	659460	and doesn't change an interviewee's intent or meaning.
659460	670120	Which brings us back to Jesse Ventura's conspiracy programme.
670120	683620	Look again at that Santa interview with a more practised eye.
683620	685180	You see it now?
685180	692660	That's right, the explanation Santa gave about the deletions was, ironically, itself deleted.
692660	696740	Instead the programme goes to a cutaway and another part of Santa's interview is inserted
696740	698380	in its place.
698380	702300	If we listen to the first part of the clip before the edit, it sounds as though Santa's
702300	712740	about to explain what the deletions were.
712740	716620	What and what?
716620	718660	We already know there were deletions.
718660	722280	Santa said fifteen years ago that changes were made to the chapter.
722280	726060	The controversy is about what those deletions were.
726060	729940	But for some reason we don't get to hear the rest of Santa's sentence.
729940	732940	It's um deleted.
732940	737100	Now maybe Santa didn't go on to explain what the deletions were.
737100	740740	But if that's the case, then why didn't the interviewer ask him?
740740	743080	After all, that's the whole point of the interview.
743080	747580	It's the one thing the show and its audience want to know.
747580	751820	The result of this clever editing is that a lot of bloggers, completely oblivious to
751820	758480	the cutaway, are quoting Santa as if this is what he actually said.
758480	763140	And even adding things they thought he said.
763140	765260	That's the power of television.
765260	770320	Producers know what their target audience wants to hear and the film can be edited accordingly.
770320	775180	If you want to make a TV series called Quest for Lost Civilizations, for example, then
775180	779260	you really have to give your audience lost civilizations.
779260	782000	This one I have some personal experience with.
782000	787400	In 1999 I was asked by New Scientist magazine to investigate a strange underwater structure
787400	790880	called the Yonaguni Monument in the western Pacific.
790880	795360	It had featured in a television series by the author Graham Hancock, who postulated
795360	800520	that the structure, which consists of horizontal steps and occasional holes, could be man-made.
800520	803160	Here's how he introduced it.
803160	807460	On the other side of the Pacific Ocean there's exciting evidence of a civilization that could
807460	811320	have been lost in the cataclysm.
811320	816000	It lies off the most southerly Japanese island of Yonaguni.
816000	819480	Of course, Hancock isn't an expert, he's a journalist.
819480	828160	So for his documentary he consulted three real experts, Egyptologist John Anthony West,
828160	842960	geologist Dr Robert Schoch, and geologist Professor Masaaki Kimura.
842960	844800	When do you think that man made it?
844800	852800	Based upon the sea level change, the age is older than 9,000 years.
852800	855720	Somewhere between 9,000 and 10,000 years?
855720	856720	Yes.
856720	861840	So from the film it seems the experts and amateurs agree that Yonaguni is largely man-made
861840	867520	and built more than 9,000 years ago, thus supporting the idea of a lost civilization.
867520	869340	Or do they?
869340	872980	The reason I remember this story is because when it was published it caused quite a bit
872980	874560	of consternation.
874560	879040	Hancock complained to new scientists that my story unfairly cast doubt on the conclusion
879040	881080	of his documentary.
881080	885500	But as with the videos I make on this channel, I wasn't expressing my own opinion in the
885500	889800	new scientist's story, I simply consulted two experts.
889800	895560	Two of the same experts that Hancock had used in his film, Robert Schoch and Masaaki Kimura,
895560	899060	and I reported what they said based on their research.
899060	902940	Kimura told me he thought it was a natural rock formation that had been worked on by
902940	909260	humans when it rose above sea level due to tectonic uplift, between 5 and 2,000 years
909260	910260	ago.
910260	915180	And he sent me a review of his book, giving an age of just over 2,000 years based on carbon
915180	916180	dating.
916180	920900	Schoch thought the structure was entirely natural, and that the steps and holes were
920900	922840	erosion features.
922840	927340	And although I didn't interview or quote John Anthony West, he had already written about
927340	933820	the structure soon after visiting it, and also concluded that it was entirely natural.
933820	936600	So this was quite an editing feat.
936600	940180	Hancock consulted three experts about the Yonaguni monument.
940180	945160	One of them thought it was most likely worked on by humans a little over 2,000 years ago,
945160	948700	and two of them thought the structure was entirely natural.
948700	951940	Yet none of this expert opinion was conveyed to the viewer.
951940	957500	Instead, we're led exclusively to Hancock's conclusion that Yonaguni was probably carved
957500	960820	12,000 years ago by a lost civilization.
960820	967460	Its presence here suggests a very sophisticated civilization at an impossibly early date.
967460	971780	But one thing, didn't we hear Kimura tell Hancock quite clearly that humans made this
971780	974180	structure more than 9,000 years ago?
974180	976180	Actually, no.
976180	978060	When do you think that men made it?
978060	986060	Based upon the sea level change, the age is older than 9,000 years.
986060	988660	Somewhere between 9,000 and 10,000 years?
988660	989660	Yes.
989660	991980	The question put by Hancock was...
991980	993460	When do you think that men made it?
993460	998140	We then cut to something rather fuzzy from Kimura about sea level change, and then we
998140	1004380	see another cut, and Kimura talking about something being older than 9,000 years.
1004380	1006140	Then Hancock adds another date.
1006140	1008860	Somewhere between 9,000 and 10,000 years?
1008860	1009860	Yes.
1009860	1014580	Whatever we think we heard, a lot is obviously missing between the question at the beginning
1014580	1016900	and the answer at the end.
1016900	1021420	If I ask people whether they trust what they see on television, I usually get a resounding
1021420	1022880	no.
1022880	1027500	Everyone seems to know that most television programs are in the business of entertainment.
1027500	1031460	Everyone knows TV producers can make you think you've seen something that never happened
1031460	1033980	or heard something that wasn't said.
1033980	1038060	Yes, we all know it, but boy, we still fall for it.
