0	6000	This is a discussion I had with a YouTuber called Academic Agent a couple of weeks ago, at his invitation,
6000	10000	in response to my criticism of a video he had posted. Here's a taste of it.
10000	16000	...my continued scepticism about the methods used to prove man-made climate change.
16000	18000	As I said on Twitter,
18000	22000	one reason for my scepticism is because the people who are loudest about it
22000	27000	are also those who show themselves to be incredibly dishonest in practically every other walk of life.
27000	31000	The proposition, even from followers and subscribers of mine, seems to be,
31000	37000	yes, the Guardian are wrong about politics, economics, gender, race, statistics in general, science in general,
37000	42000	and basically all other issues, but you really should trust them about climate change.
42000	47000	Since our subsequent discussion is posted on his channel in its entirety,
47000	53000	I'm going to cut the basic introductions at the beginning and skip to the first question and my answer to it.
53000	57000	This will be just the first part, I hope to post the rest at a later date,
57000	60000	but you can go to his channel if you want to see the whole thing.
60000	64000	Let me see if I can open up my first question.
64000	68000	This is actually a question that was sent to me by James Delingpole,
68000	73000	who writes for The Spectator and Breitbart, among other things,
73000	81000	and he is, I think, fairly well known as a prominent climate change sceptic.
81000	90000	And he asked this question. He said, does he, as in, does Potola, even understand the sceptical position,
90000	94000	and if he does, what's his defence?
97000	102000	My basic answer to Delingpole would be, what is the critic's position?
102000	107000	Because the critic's position is different according to who you talk to.
107000	115000	I mean, for example, AA, you take the position, or at least you seem to agree with the position of Willy Soon,
115000	121000	since you reprinted his graph in your video, and I'm not sure if you knew it was his graph,
121000	128000	but it was a graph from his 2005 paper, showing that the sun is increasing in power.
128000	131000	There's more heat, more solar output.
132000	141000	Because the truth is that 2018, when you look at longer timeframes, is not that much of an outlier.
141000	147000	In fact, ice levels seem to rise and fall with the temperature of the sun. Funny, that, isn't it?
147000	153000	So question two is this. Why does arctic temperature, which is what all this recent fuss is about,
153000	157000	correlate pretty much one-to-one with sun temperature?
158000	165000	Now, that's his position. He's a critic, or what you would call a sceptic.
165000	168000	On the other hand, there are a lot of people like Anthony Watts, who runs What's Up With That,
168000	172000	who says, no, the sun is decreasing. So what is the position?
172000	178000	Some people say that CO2 has no effect on global temperature, some say it has a small effect on global temperature.
178000	182000	Some people, like John Coleman, say that CO2 is too small to be effective,
182000	186000	because it's only 0.03% and a teeny weeny amount.
186000	190000	And yet, someone like Christopher Monkton says that CO2 is plant food,
190000	193000	and it's absolutely essential for the planet and has a huge effect.
193000	199000	So there's no sceptic position. I've read something called the sceptics manual,
199000	207000	and I also saw Molyneux's video on the sceptics position in 12 minutes.
207000	211000	But that bears no relation to what a lot of sceptics out there are saying.
211000	214000	This is why I say they're critics rather than sceptics.
214000	223000	Just one thing. A lot of people in the chat are asking me to ask you to turn your camera off to improve your audio.
223000	235000	Oh, OK, sure. So I'll show you that Willy Soon thing, because I have that.
236000	245000	OK, this was on your video, and you were using this as an example, as Willy Soon did,
245000	252000	that Arctic temperatures are following solar output, or total solar irradiance.
252000	258000	You can actually see the scale on the left-hand side is in watts per square metre,
258000	261000	which is how TSI is standardly done.
261000	265000	But he shows it increasing over the last 40 years, very clearly.
265000	269000	You can see, if you look at the timescale at the bottom, the last 40 years shows an increase.
269000	278000	And yet, Anthony Watts, just about every other so-called sceptic or critic of climate science,
278000	283000	would say, no, that's wrong, it's been decreasing.
283000	285000	And in fact, it has been decreasing.
285000	294000	That's very clear, because they can take measurements from satellites of the output of the Sun directly,
294000	296000	and it shows a very clear increase.
296000	301000	Now, I'll give you another graph which shows that.
301000	307000	First of all, here's the PMOD graph from the Max Planck Institute.
307000	311000	I'll put that up on the screen. OK, there it is.
311000	316000	Now, this is the actual measurement of total solar irradiance.
316000	319000	This is a satellite which measures the output of the Sun.
319000	321000	So you can see quite clearly from that that it's going down.
321000	323000	Now, this is not controversial.
323000	329000	As I said, this is not just something that is a debate between scientists and critics.
329000	332000	I'm going to show you another graph here.
332000	334000	This is from Climate4U.
334000	343000	And Climate4U is not by any means a site that is sympathetic towards the conclusions of main scientists.
343000	346000	So I'll just bring that up for you.
346000	348000	And again, now this is measuring something different.
348000	354000	This is sunspot numbers. Sunspot numbers are very closely correlated with total solar irradiance.
354000	362000	So this is why they're often used to show the amount of solar activity and the amount of sunlight that we're getting.
362000	370000	Again, if you look back over the last 40 years since 1980, very, very obvious decline.
370000	375000	I could show you the one from What's Up With That, but believe me, it's going to show you exactly the same thing.
375000	383000	So here again, we have a problem in that Willy Soon is putting this information out.
383000	387000	It's been picked up by people all over the Internet.
387000	393000	And it's passed around blogs and all sorts of other things.
393000	396000	And people believe it.
396000	407000	Now, you put this on your website and you presumably thought that this was a legitimate and authentic piece of information.
407000	411000	But that's what I mean by tracking things down to the source.
411000	416000	If you actually check the source of the information, you can discover where that comes from.
416000	420000	And check the information to see if it's accurate. And it's not.
420000	426000	So this is why people know, scientists say that the sun is not responsible for recent warming,
426000	433000	because it's been decreasing at a time when global temperatures have been increasing.
433000	440000	Now, you said in the video that there's a one to one correlation, but clearly the correlation actually is negative.
440000	446000	In other words, if there is any correlation at all, it is that as the sun gets cooler, the Arctic gets warmer.
446000	451000	Now, that is obviously not the kind of correlation that makes any sense.
451000	457000	So I seem to remember that it wasn't a correlation between temperatures and the sun.
457000	464000	It was a correlation between CO2 levels and what the sun has been doing.
465000	472000	Let me just get it up again and I'll show you, because there were actually two graphs there.
472000	476000	You're looking at it now, right?
476000	478000	Yes, I can see it.
478000	483000	Now, I'm just going to have to look at a bigger one so that I can see the scale on it.
483000	495000	Now, the one on the left is Willy Soon's graph from his 2005 paper showing total solar irradiance against Arctic temperatures.
495000	501000	What he's showing there is Arctic temperatures going up since 1960.
501000	506000	And fair enough, that's probably what the temperature record shows.
506000	509000	I'm not sure. I think it was a record in Reykjavik he was taking or something.
509000	512000	But we do know that Arctic temperatures have been rising.
512000	518000	But alongside that or superimposed on that is a red line.
518000	523000	Now, that's in the left hand graph and the red line is showing total solar irradiance going up.
523000	532000	Now, when you talk about trickery and skullduggery in statistics, he is showing an increase in solar irradiance,
532000	538000	which is not there, in order to make it fit a temperature rise that is there.
538000	541000	Now, on the right hand side, the one you were referring to just now,
541000	550000	here we've got carbon dioxide in the red line and we've got Arctic temperatures in the grey in the background.
550000	553000	And again, it looks as though there is no correlation.
553000	559000	But I don't know exactly where he's got these figures from.
559000	564000	I hope he hasn't manipulated this to the extent that he manipulated the other one.
565000	570000	If we look at carbon dioxide levels in comparison to global temperatures,
570000	574000	because when we talk about global warming, we are talking about global warming.
574000	581000	There might be differences in Reykjavik that may not be impacted by carbon dioxide.
581000	587000	There might be some local thing there to do with temperature measurements that I don't know about.
587000	592000	I haven't looked into that graph. But what I'm saying is you can't take these things at face value.
592000	595000	Since we had that discussion, I've checked the right hand graph,
595000	600000	and I can't see any problem with the Reykjavik temperature data or the CO2 data used.
600000	604000	I think the problem was mine, I was probably misreading the timescale of the graph.
604000	611000	If you look at the period of warming since 1975, it in fact correlates very well with the steep rise in CO2,
611000	616000	whereas of course there is no correlation at all between warming Reykjavik and a cooling sun,
616000	619000	the complete opposite of what Willy Soon was claiming.
619000	626000	I also checked this against the world temperature vs CO2 graphs of the same time period, and it matches pretty well.
626000	629000	This graph is from the Stanford Solar Centre.
629000	634000	CO2 concentration is the blue line, which correlates well with the red line of global temperature,
634000	641000	except for the period from around 1941 to 1975 when we had heavy aerosol pollution.
641000	647000	The orange line, which is solar irradiance, only shows a correlation up to the late 1940s.
648000	653000	You have to look into it. The first time I saw Willy Soon's graph on your video,
653000	658000	yeah, I was impressed with it. I thought, wow, yeah, that does look as though it correlates.
658000	663000	But as soon as I saw that that was total solar irradiance, I thought, no, there's something fishy going on there,
663000	669000	because no one in the scientific community, even the measurements that are being taken directly of the sun,
669000	673000	show that there's any kind of an increase.
673000	680000	I do have one question here, which is that, and again, this is more from the economics point of view,
680000	690000	but one of the things that you're always taught to do when you're looking at things economically
690000	698000	is not to look for a single, it's seldom the case that there's a single cause for any given historical phenomena,
698000	702000	and then to be sceptical of people who look for single causes.
702000	707000	So could it not be, I mean, I'm just playing devil's advocate here a bit,
707000	713000	could it not be that both the sun and CO2 play a role here, and that it could be, you know,
713000	718000	some of one and half a dozen of the other? Why would it not be that?
718000	725000	Oh, okay, but the thing is, there are three main drivers of climate, and I'm talking about active drivers of climate.
725000	730000	It's actually a rather complicated thing once you get into the passive drivers,
730000	736000	but the active drivers of climate are the sun, carbon dioxide and aerosols.
736000	740000	And as a geologist, I mean, looking back over 500 million years,
740000	744000	these are the things that have basically set the global temperature.
744000	746000	And they're no different today than they were then.
746000	751000	And whenever people talk about, oh, humans are causing this, I say, no, humans are not causing it.
751000	757000	Humans have been on this planet for 150,000 years and we haven't disrupted the climate.
757000	762000	It's carbon dioxide. And once you understand it's not humans, it's carbon dioxide that does it,
762000	768000	then everything else falls into place because you can see the correlation throughout geological history.
768000	773000	So, yeah, the sun and carbon dioxide together are the influencers.
773000	780000	Now, in the short term, we're talking about decades and perhaps 100, 200 years, which may sound long term,
780000	787000	but there's actually, let's say, medium term because in geological time that's the blink of an eye.
787000	798000	The sun, since it has been declining in solar power, in solar output or TSI, total solar irradiance,
798000	802000	whatever measure you want to make of it, would actually have a cooling effect.
802000	804000	Now, I don't think anybody would deny it.
804000	813000	I hear a lot of critics, the so-called sceptics, who say it's the sun, stupid. The sun controls the climate.
813000	821000	Well, if the sun controls the climate, how come the climate hasn't been cooling for the last 40 years when solar activity has been going down?
821000	829000	In fact, the sun is having a downward impact on temperatures. It's called a forcing and it's like a tug of war.
830000	836000	It doesn't mean that the earth is getting cooler, but clearly it's not, unless you want to argue about that.
836000	839000	But clearly the earth is warming up.
839000	848000	But if the sun is getting cooler and trying to depress global temperatures, as it has been for the last 40 years, something else must be pushing them up.
848000	856000	Now, that's not the reason why they know it's CO2. I mean, this theory that CO2 affects global temperature has been around since 1896.
856000	860000	It's not new. It's not the least bit controversial in the scientific community.
860000	866000	So that's not the reason they know. But it just is so consistent with the theory.
866000	869000	And that's what scientists always look for, is consistency.
869000	879000	That if these are the three main drivers of climate, then there should be a consistency of when they are in this tug of war, one against the other.
879000	883000	That the temperature should be responding to that tug of war. And it is.
883000	888000	Now, when you talk about economics, I'm with you. Boy, there are so many different things.
888000	896000	I mean, I was laughing when Donald Trump couldn't understand why there was such good news in the United States and the stock market went down.
896000	901000	Well, I can explain to him why the stock market goes down when there's good news. And I'm sure that you can as well.
901000	906000	It's not rocket science. It's been going on for a long time.
906000	909000	And I'm heavily invested in the stock market.
909000	915000	So I do understand how economics works. Trying to get a handle on which stocks are going up and which stocks are going down.
915000	919000	How the economy is going to go is an incredibly difficult thing.
919000	924000	And I think you'd probably agree with this, partly because you're trying to read human emotions.
924000	930000	And to a certain extent, human emotions are predictable. The way that humans are going to behave is predictable.
930000	935000	But you've seen these experiments they do with bubbles where people know that a bubble is going to happen.
935000	941000	You know the experiments I'm talking about. Yeah. And they know the bubble is going to happen.
941000	944000	They're on computer screens and they're buying and they're buying and they're buying.
944000	952000	And even though they know that what they are buying on the computer is now the purchase price is far more than what it's worth.
952000	956000	And they know that the price is going to decline. They still create these bubbles.
956000	960000	We have an amazing capacity for doing things that are totally illogical.
961000	966000	But the wonderful thing about physics is, yes, you can have one thing that has such an effect.
966000	971000	And the Earth is a very simple system when you look at things like energy in, energy out.
971000	979000	Because energy and temperature are directly correlated and directly related in a very simple equation.
979000	983000	And I've seen economic equations that I can't get my head around.
983000	991000	I mean, some of these equations in economics, even if they work, are so complicated you need a computer in order to work them.
991000	994000	So I think you can't really compare the two. And I do get what you're saying about economics.
994000	1000000	There are so many variables. It's such a chaotic thing. And climate is very similar to that.
1000000	1006000	It's very chaotic. But global temperature is not. Global temperature is actually fairly simple.
1006000	1013000	I did want to ask my second question on this, which is that if it's such a clear-cut thing,
1013000	1022000	why do you think that skepticism persists despite what you present as overwhelming evidence in your videos?
1022000	1026000	I mean, why is there still a debate about this?
1026000	1030000	Well, actually, in the scientific community, there's no debate at all.
1030000	1034000	There hasn't been really a debate about this since the 1970s or 80s.
1034000	1041000	And even before that, I mean, the whole point of the whole idea of CO2 changing temperatures has never been a controversial one.
1041000	1045000	It's always been accepted. And no one ever thought it was anything untoward.
1045000	1054000	You've got papers going back to the 1930s, 1950s, 1960s, all very clearly showing that carbon dioxide is a major driver of climate.
1054000	1060000	So that's not a controversial thing. The question is, why don't the general public accept this?
1060000	1068000	Why don't newspaper proprietors and television commentators and people who are not well versed in science,
1068000	1071000	why don't politicians and lobbyists accept it?
1071000	1076000	I do a lot of conversations with people because this is a very interesting question for me.
1076000	1083000	I'm always, you know, I don't like to argue a lot with the people who come on my channel and post.
1083000	1087000	Although, OK, sometimes I do. They get very irritating.
1087000	1091000	But I'm more interested in finding out why you don't accept this.
1091000	1100000	And then what happens is they give me a statement, which is clearly nonsense, which has come off the blogger's sphere, that they just I know where they got this stuff from.
1100000	1104000	They just read it. They believe it. They copy it and they paste it.
1104000	1109000	And to me, that's the opposite of being skeptical. That's why I don't call these critics skeptics.
1109000	1116000	But I then show them, actually, this information is wrong, just as I've just shown you with the Willy Soon graph.
1116000	1121000	And I'm showing you the actual measurements of the Sun show it's been decreasing instead of increasing.
1121000	1127000	Now, you would have thought that any rational human being seeing that and seeing the evidence and seeing the measurements
1127000	1134000	and even seeing other skeptics who agree with that, other critics who agree, would say, oh, you're right.
1134000	1140000	But they don't. They they double down on it and they insist that the whole they just change the subject or they run away.
1140000	1145000	They don't come back. It's very rare that I'll get someone saying, oh, thanks for explaining that to me.
1145000	1149000	Now I get it. I didn't realize I had been misled by this blog.
1149000	1156000	They still have this absolute faith that whatever blog they've attached themselves to must be telling them the truth.
1156000	1163000	They there's a kind of an echo chamber. And to be honest, I think this has happened since the rise of the Internet,
1163000	1174000	because I've been in this the science business for a long time and I've been reporting on climate change since the 1980s for new scientists and others.
1174000	1184000	And I don't remember this this kind of criticism of the scientific community in such a vehement fashion.
1184000	1188000	And it did happen to a certain extent with the ozone layer.
1188000	1193000	And I remember Paul Harvey criticizing it and Rush Limbaugh criticizing it.
1193000	1198000	But despite the fact they had an audience, there was no echo chamber as there is now.
1198000	1203000	People now seem to be very attached to the blogs that they are convinced.
1203000	1210000	I think a lot of that stuff could be easily be explained through what I'd call confirmation bias and heuristics.
1210000	1214000	You know, the Daniel Kahneman stuff, we can kind of can explain a lot of that.
1214000	1223000	But I mean, I do that there are still some questions that persist about this, because whenever I whenever I've asked people about this,
1223000	1226000	one of the answers I'll get back is, well, you know, it's a vested interest.
1226000	1229000	They have lobby, they are powerful lobby groups behind them.
1229000	1233000	But if you actually listen to Delingpole and Friends,
1233000	1243000	they all present themselves more as victims, as people who have been handed out and shut down and treated as pariahs,
1243000	1251000	and who have in many cases lost prestige or lost jobs or lost money as a result of it.
1251000	1256000	And yet they still persist. Whereas if you look at the incentives on the other side,
1256000	1265000	the people who push these things through their research, they get rewarded with grants, with government funding,
1265000	1271000	with, you know, in many cases these days they have big business behind them.
1271000	1276000	And one of the things that I thought about was, why does that happen?
1276000	1288000	And I do wonder if, let's just grant that everything that you're saying is absolutely, as in there's no debate about the science.
1288000	1296000	Can you still understand people who may be sceptical of the political ends being pushed?
1296000	1302000	Because one thing that does come with climate change is an agenda that says,
1302000	1306000	well, basically the only people who can sort this out are the government.
1306000	1310000	The solutions have to be pushed from the top down.
1310000	1315000	Sorry, there's too many things we're dealing with here. Let's deal with one.
1315000	1322000	I'm very familiar with these arguments, by the way, and they really astonish me.
1322000	1328000	I wanted to go back to the first one, and I should have been taking notes, and I can't remember now what the first.
1328000	1334000	But let's start with the grants. Now, having grants to do research is basically how scientists do things.
1334000	1345000	It doesn't matter whether you're an oceanographer or a climatologist or a geologist or a geophysicist or whatever field you're in.
1345000	1354000	The reason people get into research is because they are incredibly interested in learning how the world works.
1355000	1360000	Look, I've interviewed hundreds of researchers over the last 30, 40 years,
1360000	1367000	and one thing that they really share is a passion for finding out how things work.
1367000	1372000	And let's face it, that's not just a nerdy thing that interests them,
1372000	1378000	but if they want to get anywhere in life, if they want to win a Nobel Prize,
1378000	1383000	the way you do that in science is by showing something that nobody else has discovered.
1383000	1386000	You don't do it by repeating what everybody else has already done.
1386000	1391000	This is what makes me laugh when people say, oh, they're just sort of toeing the line.
1391000	1395000	What they're desperate to do is actually show something different.
1395000	1404000	And getting research grants does mean that you then get loads of money to live a fantastic lifestyle.
1404000	1409000	It's actually quite the opposite. The people that go in for research are normally the top of their class.
1409000	1414000	You don't go and get a PhD if you're stupid, and you work in the field of academia, so you know that.
1414000	1417000	These are the brightest and the best who normally get PhDs,
1417000	1423000	go on to universities to teach, and primarily to do the research.
1423000	1425000	That's why they take these positions.
1425000	1431000	What I'm referring to here is, I mean, some of the stories that you'll hear is that, I don't know,
1431000	1435000	somebody wants to do research on squirrels, OK?
1435000	1440000	I know what you're going to tell me, and they relate it to climate change, and therefore they can get their money.
1440000	1442000	Exactly.
1442000	1450000	OK. There's no surprise about the fact that as climate change becomes a more immediate problem,
1450000	1452000	more research is going to be done on it.
1452000	1455000	I'd like to know any field of science where that has not been the case.
1455000	1462000	When HIV-AIDS came into the fore in the 70s and 80s, there was a huge amount of research went into that,
1462000	1468000	not just in medical research, but in social sciences, a massive amount of research, because it was a problem.
1468000	1474000	When we had plate tectonics, now this is my field, when plate tectonics came up,
1474000	1481000	and I did my degree a long time ago, plate tectonics was still basically in the hypothesis stage back then.
1481000	1489000	Once people understood that earthquakes were caused by these moving plates, a huge amount of money was spent on research.
1489000	1492000	But this is done not to line the pockets of researchers.
1492000	1499000	This is done for a very good reason, because once you understand that earthquakes are caused by plate tectonics,
1499000	1504000	they're not just faults that for some random reason are moving that we can't understand.
1504000	1507000	We now understand the mechanism behind us.
1507000	1509000	Then we need to really investigate this.
1509000	1514000	And through all that research, we now have a much clearer understanding of where earthquakes will strike,
1514000	1517000	when they might strike and how big they might be.
1517000	1521000	And as a result of that, engineers can then either retrofit buildings
1521000	1526000	or the building code can be changed in order to make buildings more secure against earthquakes.
1526000	1532000	So, yeah, a huge amount of research goes in every time we identify a problem.
1532000	1539000	I'm not sure why that is a mystery or why that means that the research must be bad.
1539000	1546000	I think what people think is that because these guys, and by the way, squirrels and global warming,
1546000	1553000	I don't know if that's ever a thing, but it's possible, but it doesn't mean that you then fake your results
1553000	1560000	and you have to say that there's global warming by faking results.
1560000	1562000	That would be the end of a career.
1562000	1567000	So any scientist who has decided to go into the field of research,
1567000	1571000	instead of into the very lucrative field of lobbying for companies
1571000	1576000	or working for a corporation in doing commercial research,
1576000	1580000	they would have absolutely no interest in faking results
1580000	1587000	and even less interest in having that fakery discovered and being stripped of their careers and their reputations.
1587000	1589000	It does happen occasionally.
1589000	1594000	But the thing is, you know, just saying that as a matter of principle,
1594000	1598000	because they're getting grant money, they must be faking their results is a bit of a stretch.
1598000	1603000	I think I would like to see evidence of someone faking results rather than just insinuation.
1603000	1607000	I'm going to have to leave it there because this file is getting too big.
1607000	1611000	As I said, you can see the rest of the discussion on Academic Agents' channel,
1611000	1614000	and maybe I'll upload the rest when I have more time.
