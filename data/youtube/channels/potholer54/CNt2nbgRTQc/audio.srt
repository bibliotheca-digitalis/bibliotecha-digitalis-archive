00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,000
This is a discussion I had with a YouTuber called Academic Agent a couple of weeks ago, at his invitation,

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:10,000
in response to my criticism of a video he had posted. Here's a taste of it.

3
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:16,000
...my continued scepticism about the methods used to prove man-made climate change.

4
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:18,000
As I said on Twitter,

5
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:22,000
one reason for my scepticism is because the people who are loudest about it

6
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:27,000
are also those who show themselves to be incredibly dishonest in practically every other walk of life.

7
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:31,000
The proposition, even from followers and subscribers of mine, seems to be,

8
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:37,000
yes, the Guardian are wrong about politics, economics, gender, race, statistics in general, science in general,

9
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:42,000
and basically all other issues, but you really should trust them about climate change.

10
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:47,000
Since our subsequent discussion is posted on his channel in its entirety,

11
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:53,000
I'm going to cut the basic introductions at the beginning and skip to the first question and my answer to it.

12
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:57,000
This will be just the first part, I hope to post the rest at a later date,

13
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:00,000
but you can go to his channel if you want to see the whole thing.

14
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:04,000
Let me see if I can open up my first question.

15
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:08,000
This is actually a question that was sent to me by James Delingpole,

16
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:13,000
who writes for The Spectator and Breitbart, among other things,

17
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:21,000
and he is, I think, fairly well known as a prominent climate change sceptic.

18
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:30,000
And he asked this question. He said, does he, as in, does Potola, even understand the sceptical position,

19
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:34,000
and if he does, what's his defence?

20
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:42,000
My basic answer to Delingpole would be, what is the critic's position?

21
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:47,000
Because the critic's position is different according to who you talk to.

22
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:55,000
I mean, for example, AA, you take the position, or at least you seem to agree with the position of Willy Soon,

23
00:01:55,000 --> 00:02:01,000
since you reprinted his graph in your video, and I'm not sure if you knew it was his graph,

24
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:08,000
but it was a graph from his 2005 paper, showing that the sun is increasing in power.

25
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:11,000
There's more heat, more solar output.

26
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:21,000
Because the truth is that 2018, when you look at longer timeframes, is not that much of an outlier.

27
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:27,000
In fact, ice levels seem to rise and fall with the temperature of the sun. Funny, that, isn't it?

28
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:33,000
So question two is this. Why does arctic temperature, which is what all this recent fuss is about,

29
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:37,000
correlate pretty much one-to-one with sun temperature?

30
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:45,000
Now, that's his position. He's a critic, or what you would call a sceptic.

31
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:48,000
On the other hand, there are a lot of people like Anthony Watts, who runs What's Up With That,

32
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:52,000
who says, no, the sun is decreasing. So what is the position?

33
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:58,000
Some people say that CO2 has no effect on global temperature, some say it has a small effect on global temperature.

34
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:02,000
Some people, like John Coleman, say that CO2 is too small to be effective,

35
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:06,000
because it's only 0.03% and a teeny weeny amount.

36
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:10,000
And yet, someone like Christopher Monkton says that CO2 is plant food,

37
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:13,000
and it's absolutely essential for the planet and has a huge effect.

38
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:19,000
So there's no sceptic position. I've read something called the sceptics manual,

39
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:27,000
and I also saw Molyneux's video on the sceptics position in 12 minutes.

40
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:31,000
But that bears no relation to what a lot of sceptics out there are saying.

41
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:34,000
This is why I say they're critics rather than sceptics.

42
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:43,000
Just one thing. A lot of people in the chat are asking me to ask you to turn your camera off to improve your audio.

43
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:55,000
Oh, OK, sure. So I'll show you that Willy Soon thing, because I have that.

44
00:03:56,000 --> 00:04:05,000
OK, this was on your video, and you were using this as an example, as Willy Soon did,

45
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:12,000
that Arctic temperatures are following solar output, or total solar irradiance.

46
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:18,000
You can actually see the scale on the left-hand side is in watts per square metre,

47
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:21,000
which is how TSI is standardly done.

48
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:25,000
But he shows it increasing over the last 40 years, very clearly.

49
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:29,000
You can see, if you look at the timescale at the bottom, the last 40 years shows an increase.

50
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:38,000
And yet, Anthony Watts, just about every other so-called sceptic or critic of climate science,

51
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:43,000
would say, no, that's wrong, it's been decreasing.

52
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:45,000
And in fact, it has been decreasing.

53
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:54,000
That's very clear, because they can take measurements from satellites of the output of the Sun directly,

54
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,000
and it shows a very clear increase.

55
00:04:56,000 --> 00:05:01,000
Now, I'll give you another graph which shows that.

56
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:07,000
First of all, here's the PMOD graph from the Max Planck Institute.

57
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:11,000
I'll put that up on the screen. OK, there it is.

58
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:16,000
Now, this is the actual measurement of total solar irradiance.

59
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:19,000
This is a satellite which measures the output of the Sun.

60
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:21,000
So you can see quite clearly from that that it's going down.

61
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:23,000
Now, this is not controversial.

62
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:29,000
As I said, this is not just something that is a debate between scientists and critics.

63
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:32,000
I'm going to show you another graph here.

64
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:34,000
This is from Climate4U.

65
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:43,000
And Climate4U is not by any means a site that is sympathetic towards the conclusions of main scientists.

66
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:46,000
So I'll just bring that up for you.

67
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,000
And again, now this is measuring something different.

68
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:54,000
This is sunspot numbers. Sunspot numbers are very closely correlated with total solar irradiance.

69
00:05:54,000 --> 00:06:02,000
So this is why they're often used to show the amount of solar activity and the amount of sunlight that we're getting.

70
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:10,000
Again, if you look back over the last 40 years since 1980, very, very obvious decline.

71
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:15,000
I could show you the one from What's Up With That, but believe me, it's going to show you exactly the same thing.

72
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:23,000
So here again, we have a problem in that Willy Soon is putting this information out.

73
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:27,000
It's been picked up by people all over the Internet.

74
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:33,000
And it's passed around blogs and all sorts of other things.

75
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:36,000
And people believe it.

76
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:47,000
Now, you put this on your website and you presumably thought that this was a legitimate and authentic piece of information.

77
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:51,000
But that's what I mean by tracking things down to the source.

78
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:56,000
If you actually check the source of the information, you can discover where that comes from.

79
00:06:56,000 --> 00:07:00,000
And check the information to see if it's accurate. And it's not.

80
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:06,000
So this is why people know, scientists say that the sun is not responsible for recent warming,

81
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:13,000
because it's been decreasing at a time when global temperatures have been increasing.

82
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:20,000
Now, you said in the video that there's a one to one correlation, but clearly the correlation actually is negative.

83
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:26,000
In other words, if there is any correlation at all, it is that as the sun gets cooler, the Arctic gets warmer.

84
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:31,000
Now, that is obviously not the kind of correlation that makes any sense.

85
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:37,000
So I seem to remember that it wasn't a correlation between temperatures and the sun.

86
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:44,000
It was a correlation between CO2 levels and what the sun has been doing.

87
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:52,000
Let me just get it up again and I'll show you, because there were actually two graphs there.

88
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:56,000
You're looking at it now, right?

89
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:58,000
Yes, I can see it.

90
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:03,000
Now, I'm just going to have to look at a bigger one so that I can see the scale on it.

91
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:15,000
Now, the one on the left is Willy Soon's graph from his 2005 paper showing total solar irradiance against Arctic temperatures.

92
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:21,000
What he's showing there is Arctic temperatures going up since 1960.

93
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:26,000
And fair enough, that's probably what the temperature record shows.

94
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:29,000
I'm not sure. I think it was a record in Reykjavik he was taking or something.

95
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:32,000
But we do know that Arctic temperatures have been rising.

96
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:38,000
But alongside that or superimposed on that is a red line.

97
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:43,000
Now, that's in the left hand graph and the red line is showing total solar irradiance going up.

98
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:52,000
Now, when you talk about trickery and skullduggery in statistics, he is showing an increase in solar irradiance,

99
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:58,000
which is not there, in order to make it fit a temperature rise that is there.

100
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:01,000
Now, on the right hand side, the one you were referring to just now,

101
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:10,000
here we've got carbon dioxide in the red line and we've got Arctic temperatures in the grey in the background.

102
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:13,000
And again, it looks as though there is no correlation.

103
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:19,000
But I don't know exactly where he's got these figures from.

104
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:24,000
I hope he hasn't manipulated this to the extent that he manipulated the other one.

105
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:30,000
If we look at carbon dioxide levels in comparison to global temperatures,

106
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:34,000
because when we talk about global warming, we are talking about global warming.

107
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:41,000
There might be differences in Reykjavik that may not be impacted by carbon dioxide.

108
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:47,000
There might be some local thing there to do with temperature measurements that I don't know about.

109
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:52,000
I haven't looked into that graph. But what I'm saying is you can't take these things at face value.

110
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:55,000
Since we had that discussion, I've checked the right hand graph,

111
00:09:55,000 --> 00:10:00,000
and I can't see any problem with the Reykjavik temperature data or the CO2 data used.

112
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:04,000
I think the problem was mine, I was probably misreading the timescale of the graph.

113
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:11,000
If you look at the period of warming since 1975, it in fact correlates very well with the steep rise in CO2,

114
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:16,000
whereas of course there is no correlation at all between warming Reykjavik and a cooling sun,

115
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:19,000
the complete opposite of what Willy Soon was claiming.

116
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:26,000
I also checked this against the world temperature vs CO2 graphs of the same time period, and it matches pretty well.

117
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:29,000
This graph is from the Stanford Solar Centre.

118
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:34,000
CO2 concentration is the blue line, which correlates well with the red line of global temperature,

119
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:41,000
except for the period from around 1941 to 1975 when we had heavy aerosol pollution.

120
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:47,000
The orange line, which is solar irradiance, only shows a correlation up to the late 1940s.

121
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:53,000
You have to look into it. The first time I saw Willy Soon's graph on your video,

122
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:58,000
yeah, I was impressed with it. I thought, wow, yeah, that does look as though it correlates.

123
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:03,000
But as soon as I saw that that was total solar irradiance, I thought, no, there's something fishy going on there,

124
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:09,000
because no one in the scientific community, even the measurements that are being taken directly of the sun,

125
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:13,000
show that there's any kind of an increase.

126
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:20,000
I do have one question here, which is that, and again, this is more from the economics point of view,

127
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:30,000
but one of the things that you're always taught to do when you're looking at things economically

128
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:38,000
is not to look for a single, it's seldom the case that there's a single cause for any given historical phenomena,

129
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:42,000
and then to be sceptical of people who look for single causes.

130
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:47,000
So could it not be, I mean, I'm just playing devil's advocate here a bit,

131
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:53,000
could it not be that both the sun and CO2 play a role here, and that it could be, you know,

132
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:58,000
some of one and half a dozen of the other? Why would it not be that?

133
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:05,000
Oh, okay, but the thing is, there are three main drivers of climate, and I'm talking about active drivers of climate.

134
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:10,000
It's actually a rather complicated thing once you get into the passive drivers,

135
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:16,000
but the active drivers of climate are the sun, carbon dioxide and aerosols.

136
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:20,000
And as a geologist, I mean, looking back over 500 million years,

137
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:24,000
these are the things that have basically set the global temperature.

138
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:26,000
And they're no different today than they were then.

139
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:31,000
And whenever people talk about, oh, humans are causing this, I say, no, humans are not causing it.

140
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:37,000
Humans have been on this planet for 150,000 years and we haven't disrupted the climate.

141
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:42,000
It's carbon dioxide. And once you understand it's not humans, it's carbon dioxide that does it,

142
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:48,000
then everything else falls into place because you can see the correlation throughout geological history.

143
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:53,000
So, yeah, the sun and carbon dioxide together are the influencers.

144
00:12:53,000 --> 00:13:00,000
Now, in the short term, we're talking about decades and perhaps 100, 200 years, which may sound long term,

145
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:07,000
but there's actually, let's say, medium term because in geological time that's the blink of an eye.

146
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:18,000
The sun, since it has been declining in solar power, in solar output or TSI, total solar irradiance,

147
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:22,000
whatever measure you want to make of it, would actually have a cooling effect.

148
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:24,000
Now, I don't think anybody would deny it.

149
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:33,000
I hear a lot of critics, the so-called sceptics, who say it's the sun, stupid. The sun controls the climate.

150
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:41,000
Well, if the sun controls the climate, how come the climate hasn't been cooling for the last 40 years when solar activity has been going down?

151
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:49,000
In fact, the sun is having a downward impact on temperatures. It's called a forcing and it's like a tug of war.

152
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:56,000
It doesn't mean that the earth is getting cooler, but clearly it's not, unless you want to argue about that.

153
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:59,000
But clearly the earth is warming up.

154
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:08,000
But if the sun is getting cooler and trying to depress global temperatures, as it has been for the last 40 years, something else must be pushing them up.

155
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:16,000
Now, that's not the reason why they know it's CO2. I mean, this theory that CO2 affects global temperature has been around since 1896.

156
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:20,000
It's not new. It's not the least bit controversial in the scientific community.

157
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:26,000
So that's not the reason they know. But it just is so consistent with the theory.

158
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:29,000
And that's what scientists always look for, is consistency.

159
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:39,000
That if these are the three main drivers of climate, then there should be a consistency of when they are in this tug of war, one against the other.

160
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:43,000
That the temperature should be responding to that tug of war. And it is.

161
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:48,000
Now, when you talk about economics, I'm with you. Boy, there are so many different things.

162
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:56,000
I mean, I was laughing when Donald Trump couldn't understand why there was such good news in the United States and the stock market went down.

163
00:14:56,000 --> 00:15:01,000
Well, I can explain to him why the stock market goes down when there's good news. And I'm sure that you can as well.

164
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:06,000
It's not rocket science. It's been going on for a long time.

165
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:09,000
And I'm heavily invested in the stock market.

166
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:15,000
So I do understand how economics works. Trying to get a handle on which stocks are going up and which stocks are going down.

167
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:19,000
How the economy is going to go is an incredibly difficult thing.

168
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:24,000
And I think you'd probably agree with this, partly because you're trying to read human emotions.

169
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:30,000
And to a certain extent, human emotions are predictable. The way that humans are going to behave is predictable.

170
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:35,000
But you've seen these experiments they do with bubbles where people know that a bubble is going to happen.

171
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:41,000
You know the experiments I'm talking about. Yeah. And they know the bubble is going to happen.

172
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:44,000
They're on computer screens and they're buying and they're buying and they're buying.

173
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:52,000
And even though they know that what they are buying on the computer is now the purchase price is far more than what it's worth.

174
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:56,000
And they know that the price is going to decline. They still create these bubbles.

175
00:15:56,000 --> 00:16:00,000
We have an amazing capacity for doing things that are totally illogical.

176
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:06,000
But the wonderful thing about physics is, yes, you can have one thing that has such an effect.

177
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:11,000
And the Earth is a very simple system when you look at things like energy in, energy out.

178
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:19,000
Because energy and temperature are directly correlated and directly related in a very simple equation.

179
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:23,000
And I've seen economic equations that I can't get my head around.

180
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:31,000
I mean, some of these equations in economics, even if they work, are so complicated you need a computer in order to work them.

181
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:34,000
So I think you can't really compare the two. And I do get what you're saying about economics.

182
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:40,000
There are so many variables. It's such a chaotic thing. And climate is very similar to that.

183
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:46,000
It's very chaotic. But global temperature is not. Global temperature is actually fairly simple.

184
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:53,000
I did want to ask my second question on this, which is that if it's such a clear-cut thing,

185
00:16:53,000 --> 00:17:02,000
why do you think that skepticism persists despite what you present as overwhelming evidence in your videos?

186
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:06,000
I mean, why is there still a debate about this?

187
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:10,000
Well, actually, in the scientific community, there's no debate at all.

188
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:14,000
There hasn't been really a debate about this since the 1970s or 80s.

189
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:21,000
And even before that, I mean, the whole point of the whole idea of CO2 changing temperatures has never been a controversial one.

190
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:25,000
It's always been accepted. And no one ever thought it was anything untoward.

191
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:34,000
You've got papers going back to the 1930s, 1950s, 1960s, all very clearly showing that carbon dioxide is a major driver of climate.

192
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:40,000
So that's not a controversial thing. The question is, why don't the general public accept this?

193
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:48,000
Why don't newspaper proprietors and television commentators and people who are not well versed in science,

194
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:51,000
why don't politicians and lobbyists accept it?

195
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:56,000
I do a lot of conversations with people because this is a very interesting question for me.

196
00:17:56,000 --> 00:18:03,000
I'm always, you know, I don't like to argue a lot with the people who come on my channel and post.

197
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:07,000
Although, OK, sometimes I do. They get very irritating.

198
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:11,000
But I'm more interested in finding out why you don't accept this.

199
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:20,000
And then what happens is they give me a statement, which is clearly nonsense, which has come off the blogger's sphere, that they just I know where they got this stuff from.

200
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:24,000
They just read it. They believe it. They copy it and they paste it.

201
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:29,000
And to me, that's the opposite of being skeptical. That's why I don't call these critics skeptics.

202
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:36,000
But I then show them, actually, this information is wrong, just as I've just shown you with the Willy Soon graph.

203
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:41,000
And I'm showing you the actual measurements of the Sun show it's been decreasing instead of increasing.

204
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:47,000
Now, you would have thought that any rational human being seeing that and seeing the evidence and seeing the measurements

205
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:54,000
and even seeing other skeptics who agree with that, other critics who agree, would say, oh, you're right.

206
00:18:54,000 --> 00:19:00,000
But they don't. They they double down on it and they insist that the whole they just change the subject or they run away.

207
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:05,000
They don't come back. It's very rare that I'll get someone saying, oh, thanks for explaining that to me.

208
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:09,000
Now I get it. I didn't realize I had been misled by this blog.

209
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:16,000
They still have this absolute faith that whatever blog they've attached themselves to must be telling them the truth.

210
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:23,000
They there's a kind of an echo chamber. And to be honest, I think this has happened since the rise of the Internet,

211
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:34,000
because I've been in this the science business for a long time and I've been reporting on climate change since the 1980s for new scientists and others.

212
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:44,000
And I don't remember this this kind of criticism of the scientific community in such a vehement fashion.

213
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:48,000
And it did happen to a certain extent with the ozone layer.

214
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:53,000
And I remember Paul Harvey criticizing it and Rush Limbaugh criticizing it.

215
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:58,000
But despite the fact they had an audience, there was no echo chamber as there is now.

216
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:03,000
People now seem to be very attached to the blogs that they are convinced.

217
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:10,000
I think a lot of that stuff could be easily be explained through what I'd call confirmation bias and heuristics.

218
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:14,000
You know, the Daniel Kahneman stuff, we can kind of can explain a lot of that.

219
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:23,000
But I mean, I do that there are still some questions that persist about this, because whenever I whenever I've asked people about this,

220
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:26,000
one of the answers I'll get back is, well, you know, it's a vested interest.

221
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:29,000
They have lobby, they are powerful lobby groups behind them.

222
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:33,000
But if you actually listen to Delingpole and Friends,

223
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:43,000
they all present themselves more as victims, as people who have been handed out and shut down and treated as pariahs,

224
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:51,000
and who have in many cases lost prestige or lost jobs or lost money as a result of it.

225
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:56,000
And yet they still persist. Whereas if you look at the incentives on the other side,

226
00:20:56,000 --> 00:21:05,000
the people who push these things through their research, they get rewarded with grants, with government funding,

227
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:11,000
with, you know, in many cases these days they have big business behind them.

228
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:16,000
And one of the things that I thought about was, why does that happen?

229
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:28,000
And I do wonder if, let's just grant that everything that you're saying is absolutely, as in there's no debate about the science.

230
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:36,000
Can you still understand people who may be sceptical of the political ends being pushed?

231
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:42,000
Because one thing that does come with climate change is an agenda that says,

232
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:46,000
well, basically the only people who can sort this out are the government.

233
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:50,000
The solutions have to be pushed from the top down.

234
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:55,000
Sorry, there's too many things we're dealing with here. Let's deal with one.

235
00:21:55,000 --> 00:22:02,000
I'm very familiar with these arguments, by the way, and they really astonish me.

236
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:08,000
I wanted to go back to the first one, and I should have been taking notes, and I can't remember now what the first.

237
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:14,000
But let's start with the grants. Now, having grants to do research is basically how scientists do things.

238
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:25,000
It doesn't matter whether you're an oceanographer or a climatologist or a geologist or a geophysicist or whatever field you're in.

239
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:34,000
The reason people get into research is because they are incredibly interested in learning how the world works.

240
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:40,000
Look, I've interviewed hundreds of researchers over the last 30, 40 years,

241
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:47,000
and one thing that they really share is a passion for finding out how things work.

242
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:52,000
And let's face it, that's not just a nerdy thing that interests them,

243
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:58,000
but if they want to get anywhere in life, if they want to win a Nobel Prize,

244
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:03,000
the way you do that in science is by showing something that nobody else has discovered.

245
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:06,000
You don't do it by repeating what everybody else has already done.

246
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:11,000
This is what makes me laugh when people say, oh, they're just sort of toeing the line.

247
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:15,000
What they're desperate to do is actually show something different.

248
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:24,000
And getting research grants does mean that you then get loads of money to live a fantastic lifestyle.

249
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:29,000
It's actually quite the opposite. The people that go in for research are normally the top of their class.

250
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:34,000
You don't go and get a PhD if you're stupid, and you work in the field of academia, so you know that.

251
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:37,000
These are the brightest and the best who normally get PhDs,

252
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:43,000
go on to universities to teach, and primarily to do the research.

253
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:45,000
That's why they take these positions.

254
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:51,000
What I'm referring to here is, I mean, some of the stories that you'll hear is that, I don't know,

255
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:55,000
somebody wants to do research on squirrels, OK?

256
00:23:55,000 --> 00:24:00,000
I know what you're going to tell me, and they relate it to climate change, and therefore they can get their money.

257
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:02,000
Exactly.

258
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:10,000
OK. There's no surprise about the fact that as climate change becomes a more immediate problem,

259
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:12,000
more research is going to be done on it.

260
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:15,000
I'd like to know any field of science where that has not been the case.

261
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:22,000
When HIV-AIDS came into the fore in the 70s and 80s, there was a huge amount of research went into that,

262
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:28,000
not just in medical research, but in social sciences, a massive amount of research, because it was a problem.

263
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:34,000
When we had plate tectonics, now this is my field, when plate tectonics came up,

264
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:41,000
and I did my degree a long time ago, plate tectonics was still basically in the hypothesis stage back then.

265
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:49,000
Once people understood that earthquakes were caused by these moving plates, a huge amount of money was spent on research.

266
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:52,000
But this is done not to line the pockets of researchers.

267
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:59,000
This is done for a very good reason, because once you understand that earthquakes are caused by plate tectonics,

268
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:04,000
they're not just faults that for some random reason are moving that we can't understand.

269
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:07,000
We now understand the mechanism behind us.

270
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:09,000
Then we need to really investigate this.

271
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:14,000
And through all that research, we now have a much clearer understanding of where earthquakes will strike,

272
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:17,000
when they might strike and how big they might be.

273
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:21,000
And as a result of that, engineers can then either retrofit buildings

274
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:26,000
or the building code can be changed in order to make buildings more secure against earthquakes.

275
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:32,000
So, yeah, a huge amount of research goes in every time we identify a problem.

276
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:39,000
I'm not sure why that is a mystery or why that means that the research must be bad.

277
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:46,000
I think what people think is that because these guys, and by the way, squirrels and global warming,

278
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:53,000
I don't know if that's ever a thing, but it's possible, but it doesn't mean that you then fake your results

279
00:25:53,000 --> 00:26:00,000
and you have to say that there's global warming by faking results.

280
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:02,000
That would be the end of a career.

281
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:07,000
So any scientist who has decided to go into the field of research,

282
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:11,000
instead of into the very lucrative field of lobbying for companies

283
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:16,000
or working for a corporation in doing commercial research,

284
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:20,000
they would have absolutely no interest in faking results

285
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:27,000
and even less interest in having that fakery discovered and being stripped of their careers and their reputations.

286
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:29,000
It does happen occasionally.

287
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:34,000
But the thing is, you know, just saying that as a matter of principle,

288
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:38,000
because they're getting grant money, they must be faking their results is a bit of a stretch.

289
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:43,000
I think I would like to see evidence of someone faking results rather than just insinuation.

290
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:47,000
I'm going to have to leave it there because this file is getting too big.

291
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:51,000
As I said, you can see the rest of the discussion on Academic Agents' channel,

292
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:54,000
and maybe I'll upload the rest when I have more time.
