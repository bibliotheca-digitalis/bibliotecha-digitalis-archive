00:00.000 --> 00:03.120
Several posters pointed out an error in my last video.

00:03.840 --> 00:08.000
I corrected it in the video description, but it really needs to be highlighted.

00:08.720 --> 00:11.520
In that video, I showed Ivor Cummins saying this.

00:23.520 --> 00:28.160
I looked at the Lancet paper he cited, which actually wasn't published in the Lancet,

00:28.160 --> 00:33.920
but in E-Clinical Medicine, which is an open access journal published by the Lancet Group,

00:33.920 --> 00:39.360
and I said this. Nevertheless, it concluded that lockdowns don't affect mortality rates,

00:39.360 --> 00:41.600
which is supportive of Cummins's claims.

00:42.400 --> 00:47.360
But here's the problem. When I look for other studies in Lancet-owned journals,

00:47.360 --> 00:51.920
and in the Lancet itself, they all reach the opposite conclusion.

00:51.920 --> 00:55.360
They all concluded that lockdowns reduced rates of infection.

00:56.320 --> 01:00.320
And as people pointed out, that's not the opposite conclusion.

01:00.320 --> 01:05.600
The opposite conclusion would be a paper concluding that lockdowns reduce mortality rates.

01:06.160 --> 01:09.040
What they show is a reduction in infection rates.

01:09.840 --> 01:11.600
Isn't that the same thing, you might think?

01:12.240 --> 01:16.720
Well, the argument is that a slower rate of infection might cut down the number of

01:16.720 --> 01:22.000
infections in the short term, but they will get infected at some point during the pandemic.

01:22.000 --> 01:24.160
So all this does is buy time.

01:24.960 --> 01:27.920
But the reason epidemiologists say lockdown is effective

01:28.480 --> 01:32.880
is that slowing the rate of infection will ensure that there's enough space in hospitals

01:32.880 --> 01:37.520
to treat everyone who contracts Covid, thus ensuring a higher survival rate.

01:38.160 --> 01:39.920
It's known as flattening the curve.

01:40.800 --> 01:43.680
There are other benefits to delaying infections.

01:43.680 --> 01:48.320
For one thing, treatment continually improves the longer the pandemic goes on,

01:48.880 --> 01:53.200
so people who get infected now have a much better chance of survival

01:53.200 --> 01:56.160
than those who got infected earlier on in the pandemic.

01:57.040 --> 02:02.240
And of course, since there's a race to get everyone vaccinated, buying time is crucial.

02:03.120 --> 02:05.680
The better chance they have of getting a vaccine,

02:05.680 --> 02:08.560
the greater the reduction in deaths per million outcomes.

02:09.360 --> 02:14.240
So all other things being equal, there's a link between a reduction in the infection rate

02:14.240 --> 02:16.480
and a reduction in the number of deaths per million.

02:17.280 --> 02:22.960
But if that isn't explicitly stated in the papers I cited, then I shouldn't infer it.

02:23.840 --> 02:27.120
Does that mean Cummins was right when he said that there are many,

02:27.120 --> 02:33.920
many publications, as he calls them, showing that lockdown barely or does not affect

02:33.920 --> 02:35.920
deaths per million outcomes?

02:35.920 --> 02:39.120
No, because on that score, nothing has changed.

02:39.120 --> 02:42.800
The first paper on the list certainly does, as I pointed out,

02:42.880 --> 02:48.480
but the other ones I looked at in my video, where a proper citation was given, certainly don't.

02:49.120 --> 02:52.640
And since I made that video, I've checked a few others on the list,

02:52.640 --> 02:57.280
and they don't conclude that lockdown has an effect on death per million outcomes either.

02:58.080 --> 03:02.560
In addition, most of the publications on his list aren't peer-reviewed papers.

03:02.560 --> 03:07.600
Some are preprints with a specific warning that they shouldn't be reported in news media

03:07.600 --> 03:10.480
or relied upon without expert consultation.

03:11.040 --> 03:13.680
Others are opinion pieces or news articles.

03:14.560 --> 03:17.680
While I was checking this, I got an email from Ken Rice,

03:17.680 --> 03:20.960
who basically said exactly the same thing as I said earlier.

03:21.600 --> 03:24.320
So he disagrees with Cummins's conclusion

03:24.320 --> 03:27.760
that there's little or no effect of deaths per million outcomes.

03:28.720 --> 03:30.640
Oh, sorry, who's Ken Rice, you're wondering?

03:31.200 --> 03:35.600
Well, he's lead author of this study, which Cummins put 10th,

03:35.600 --> 03:40.720
apparently joint 10th, on his list of publications that supposedly

03:40.720 --> 03:45.600
support the conclusion that lockdown has little or no effect on death per million outcomes.

03:46.240 --> 03:50.800
Dr Rice's model only looked at the effect of mortality on the closure of schools,

03:50.800 --> 03:55.680
where there is little or no effect, but in the paper he didn't look at other forms of lockdown

03:55.680 --> 04:00.400
like restricted mobility, the closure of businesses, or bans on mass gatherings.

04:00.400 --> 04:05.680
When I asked about these more general forms of lockdown, Dr Rice said,

04:05.680 --> 04:08.720
the model also indicates that if we had done nothing,

04:08.720 --> 04:12.480
we would have had over 200,000 deaths in a matter of months,

04:13.040 --> 04:14.800
he's talking about the UK by the way,

04:15.360 --> 04:19.360
and would almost certainly have completely overwhelmed the health services

04:19.360 --> 04:21.920
which would have had other knock-on effects.

04:21.920 --> 04:27.280
Also, we do now seem to have a vaccine, so can protect people who might otherwise have died.

04:27.600 --> 04:32.320
So, Cummins does need to recheck the sources on his list.

04:32.320 --> 04:35.920
He needs to get rid of the blogs, the preprints, and the news articles,

04:36.720 --> 04:40.560
and get rid of the scientific studies that don't say what he claims they say.

04:41.920 --> 04:46.800
Now, Cummins can argue that in his opinion, such a conclusion about deaths per million

04:46.800 --> 04:51.200
can be inferred, but then he would be making the same mistake that I did,

04:51.200 --> 04:55.520
inferring a conclusion that the paper or article doesn't actually give,

04:55.520 --> 04:58.160
based on his own amateur and unchecked opinion.

04:59.200 --> 05:04.000
Other errors I corrected from my video were wrong images or pronunciation errors

05:04.000 --> 05:05.920
that don't affect the substance.

05:05.920 --> 05:09.600
But this one does, so I've been happy to put the record straight.

05:10.240 --> 05:13.760
I hope Iver Cummins will do likewise. We'll see.
