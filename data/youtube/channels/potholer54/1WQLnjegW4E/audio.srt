1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,120
Several posters pointed out an error in my last video.

2
00:00:03,840 --> 00:00:08,000
I corrected it in the video description, but it really needs to be highlighted.

3
00:00:08,720 --> 00:00:11,520
In that video, I showed Ivor Cummins saying this.

4
00:00:23,520 --> 00:00:28,160
I looked at the Lancet paper he cited, which actually wasn't published in the Lancet,

5
00:00:28,160 --> 00:00:33,920
but in E-Clinical Medicine, which is an open access journal published by the Lancet Group,

6
00:00:33,920 --> 00:00:39,360
and I said this. Nevertheless, it concluded that lockdowns don't affect mortality rates,

7
00:00:39,360 --> 00:00:41,600
which is supportive of Cummins's claims.

8
00:00:42,400 --> 00:00:47,360
But here's the problem. When I look for other studies in Lancet-owned journals,

9
00:00:47,360 --> 00:00:51,920
and in the Lancet itself, they all reach the opposite conclusion.

10
00:00:51,920 --> 00:00:55,360
They all concluded that lockdowns reduced rates of infection.

11
00:00:56,320 --> 00:01:00,320
And as people pointed out, that's not the opposite conclusion.

12
00:01:00,320 --> 00:01:05,600
The opposite conclusion would be a paper concluding that lockdowns reduce mortality rates.

13
00:01:06,160 --> 00:01:09,040
What they show is a reduction in infection rates.

14
00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:11,600
Isn't that the same thing, you might think?

15
00:01:12,240 --> 00:01:16,720
Well, the argument is that a slower rate of infection might cut down the number of

16
00:01:16,720 --> 00:01:22,000
infections in the short term, but they will get infected at some point during the pandemic.

17
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,160
So all this does is buy time.

18
00:01:24,960 --> 00:01:27,920
But the reason epidemiologists say lockdown is effective

19
00:01:28,480 --> 00:01:32,880
is that slowing the rate of infection will ensure that there's enough space in hospitals

20
00:01:32,880 --> 00:01:37,520
to treat everyone who contracts Covid, thus ensuring a higher survival rate.

21
00:01:38,160 --> 00:01:39,920
It's known as flattening the curve.

22
00:01:40,800 --> 00:01:43,680
There are other benefits to delaying infections.

23
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:48,320
For one thing, treatment continually improves the longer the pandemic goes on,

24
00:01:48,880 --> 00:01:53,200
so people who get infected now have a much better chance of survival

25
00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:56,160
than those who got infected earlier on in the pandemic.

26
00:01:57,040 --> 00:02:02,240
And of course, since there's a race to get everyone vaccinated, buying time is crucial.

27
00:02:03,120 --> 00:02:05,680
The better chance they have of getting a vaccine,

28
00:02:05,680 --> 00:02:08,560
the greater the reduction in deaths per million outcomes.

29
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:14,240
So all other things being equal, there's a link between a reduction in the infection rate

30
00:02:14,240 --> 00:02:16,480
and a reduction in the number of deaths per million.

31
00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:22,960
But if that isn't explicitly stated in the papers I cited, then I shouldn't infer it.

32
00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:27,120
Does that mean Cummins was right when he said that there are many,

33
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:33,920
many publications, as he calls them, showing that lockdown barely or does not affect

34
00:02:33,920 --> 00:02:35,920
deaths per million outcomes?

35
00:02:35,920 --> 00:02:39,120
No, because on that score, nothing has changed.

36
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:42,800
The first paper on the list certainly does, as I pointed out,

37
00:02:42,880 --> 00:02:48,480
but the other ones I looked at in my video, where a proper citation was given, certainly don't.

38
00:02:49,120 --> 00:02:52,640
And since I made that video, I've checked a few others on the list,

39
00:02:52,640 --> 00:02:57,280
and they don't conclude that lockdown has an effect on death per million outcomes either.

40
00:02:58,080 --> 00:03:02,560
In addition, most of the publications on his list aren't peer-reviewed papers.

41
00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:07,600
Some are preprints with a specific warning that they shouldn't be reported in news media

42
00:03:07,600 --> 00:03:10,480
or relied upon without expert consultation.

43
00:03:11,040 --> 00:03:13,680
Others are opinion pieces or news articles.

44
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:17,680
While I was checking this, I got an email from Ken Rice,

45
00:03:17,680 --> 00:03:20,960
who basically said exactly the same thing as I said earlier.

46
00:03:21,600 --> 00:03:24,320
So he disagrees with Cummins's conclusion

47
00:03:24,320 --> 00:03:27,760
that there's little or no effect of deaths per million outcomes.

48
00:03:28,720 --> 00:03:30,640
Oh, sorry, who's Ken Rice, you're wondering?

49
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:35,600
Well, he's lead author of this study, which Cummins put 10th,

50
00:03:35,600 --> 00:03:40,720
apparently joint 10th, on his list of publications that supposedly

51
00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:45,600
support the conclusion that lockdown has little or no effect on death per million outcomes.

52
00:03:46,240 --> 00:03:50,800
Dr Rice's model only looked at the effect of mortality on the closure of schools,

53
00:03:50,800 --> 00:03:55,680
where there is little or no effect, but in the paper he didn't look at other forms of lockdown

54
00:03:55,680 --> 00:04:00,400
like restricted mobility, the closure of businesses, or bans on mass gatherings.

55
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:05,680
When I asked about these more general forms of lockdown, Dr Rice said,

56
00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:08,720
the model also indicates that if we had done nothing,

57
00:04:08,720 --> 00:04:12,480
we would have had over 200,000 deaths in a matter of months,

58
00:04:13,040 --> 00:04:14,800
he's talking about the UK by the way,

59
00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:19,360
and would almost certainly have completely overwhelmed the health services

60
00:04:19,360 --> 00:04:21,920
which would have had other knock-on effects.

61
00:04:21,920 --> 00:04:27,280
Also, we do now seem to have a vaccine, so can protect people who might otherwise have died.

62
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:32,320
So, Cummins does need to recheck the sources on his list.

63
00:04:32,320 --> 00:04:35,920
He needs to get rid of the blogs, the preprints, and the news articles,

64
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:40,560
and get rid of the scientific studies that don't say what he claims they say.

65
00:04:41,920 --> 00:04:46,800
Now, Cummins can argue that in his opinion, such a conclusion about deaths per million

66
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:51,200
can be inferred, but then he would be making the same mistake that I did,

67
00:04:51,200 --> 00:04:55,520
inferring a conclusion that the paper or article doesn't actually give,

68
00:04:55,520 --> 00:04:58,160
based on his own amateur and unchecked opinion.

69
00:04:59,200 --> 00:05:04,000
Other errors I corrected from my video were wrong images or pronunciation errors

70
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:05,920
that don't affect the substance.

71
00:05:05,920 --> 00:05:09,600
But this one does, so I've been happy to put the record straight.

72
00:05:10,240 --> 00:05:13,760
I hope Iver Cummins will do likewise. We'll see.
