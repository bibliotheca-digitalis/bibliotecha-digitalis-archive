0	3120	Several posters pointed out an error in my last video.
3840	8000	I corrected it in the video description, but it really needs to be highlighted.
8720	11520	In that video, I showed Ivor Cummins saying this.
23520	28160	I looked at the Lancet paper he cited, which actually wasn't published in the Lancet,
28160	33920	but in E-Clinical Medicine, which is an open access journal published by the Lancet Group,
33920	39360	and I said this. Nevertheless, it concluded that lockdowns don't affect mortality rates,
39360	41600	which is supportive of Cummins's claims.
42400	47360	But here's the problem. When I look for other studies in Lancet-owned journals,
47360	51920	and in the Lancet itself, they all reach the opposite conclusion.
51920	55360	They all concluded that lockdowns reduced rates of infection.
56320	60320	And as people pointed out, that's not the opposite conclusion.
60320	65600	The opposite conclusion would be a paper concluding that lockdowns reduce mortality rates.
66160	69040	What they show is a reduction in infection rates.
69840	71600	Isn't that the same thing, you might think?
72240	76720	Well, the argument is that a slower rate of infection might cut down the number of
76720	82000	infections in the short term, but they will get infected at some point during the pandemic.
82000	84160	So all this does is buy time.
84960	87920	But the reason epidemiologists say lockdown is effective
88480	92880	is that slowing the rate of infection will ensure that there's enough space in hospitals
92880	97520	to treat everyone who contracts Covid, thus ensuring a higher survival rate.
98160	99920	It's known as flattening the curve.
100800	103680	There are other benefits to delaying infections.
103680	108320	For one thing, treatment continually improves the longer the pandemic goes on,
108880	113200	so people who get infected now have a much better chance of survival
113200	116160	than those who got infected earlier on in the pandemic.
117040	122240	And of course, since there's a race to get everyone vaccinated, buying time is crucial.
123120	125680	The better chance they have of getting a vaccine,
125680	128560	the greater the reduction in deaths per million outcomes.
129360	134240	So all other things being equal, there's a link between a reduction in the infection rate
134240	136480	and a reduction in the number of deaths per million.
137280	142960	But if that isn't explicitly stated in the papers I cited, then I shouldn't infer it.
143840	147120	Does that mean Cummins was right when he said that there are many,
147120	153920	many publications, as he calls them, showing that lockdown barely or does not affect
153920	155920	deaths per million outcomes?
155920	159120	No, because on that score, nothing has changed.
159120	162800	The first paper on the list certainly does, as I pointed out,
162880	168480	but the other ones I looked at in my video, where a proper citation was given, certainly don't.
169120	172640	And since I made that video, I've checked a few others on the list,
172640	177280	and they don't conclude that lockdown has an effect on death per million outcomes either.
178080	182560	In addition, most of the publications on his list aren't peer-reviewed papers.
182560	187600	Some are preprints with a specific warning that they shouldn't be reported in news media
187600	190480	or relied upon without expert consultation.
191040	193680	Others are opinion pieces or news articles.
194560	197680	While I was checking this, I got an email from Ken Rice,
197680	200960	who basically said exactly the same thing as I said earlier.
201600	204320	So he disagrees with Cummins's conclusion
204320	207760	that there's little or no effect of deaths per million outcomes.
208720	210640	Oh, sorry, who's Ken Rice, you're wondering?
211200	215600	Well, he's lead author of this study, which Cummins put 10th,
215600	220720	apparently joint 10th, on his list of publications that supposedly
220720	225600	support the conclusion that lockdown has little or no effect on death per million outcomes.
226240	230800	Dr Rice's model only looked at the effect of mortality on the closure of schools,
230800	235680	where there is little or no effect, but in the paper he didn't look at other forms of lockdown
235680	240400	like restricted mobility, the closure of businesses, or bans on mass gatherings.
240400	245680	When I asked about these more general forms of lockdown, Dr Rice said,
245680	248720	the model also indicates that if we had done nothing,
248720	252480	we would have had over 200,000 deaths in a matter of months,
253040	254800	he's talking about the UK by the way,
255360	259360	and would almost certainly have completely overwhelmed the health services
259360	261920	which would have had other knock-on effects.
261920	267280	Also, we do now seem to have a vaccine, so can protect people who might otherwise have died.
267600	272320	So, Cummins does need to recheck the sources on his list.
272320	275920	He needs to get rid of the blogs, the preprints, and the news articles,
276720	280560	and get rid of the scientific studies that don't say what he claims they say.
281920	286800	Now, Cummins can argue that in his opinion, such a conclusion about deaths per million
286800	291200	can be inferred, but then he would be making the same mistake that I did,
291200	295520	inferring a conclusion that the paper or article doesn't actually give,
295520	298160	based on his own amateur and unchecked opinion.
299200	304000	Other errors I corrected from my video were wrong images or pronunciation errors
304000	305920	that don't affect the substance.
305920	309600	But this one does, so I've been happy to put the record straight.
310240	313760	I hope Iver Cummins will do likewise. We'll see.
