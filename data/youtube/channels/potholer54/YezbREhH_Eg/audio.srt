00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
Hi, it's Allie, and I'm going to be talking to you about global warming and evolution.

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:05,000
Ooh, goodie.

3
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:09,000
Now, the first topic is global warming and why it's not real.

4
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:12,000
The ice caps in Greenland are actually getting thicker.

5
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:13,000
Huh?

6
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:16,000
Just like Y2K was not real, but everybody thought we were going to die.

7
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:22,000
Seventh-grade physics shows that CO2's molecular weight makes it very heavy.

8
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:24,000
It can't rise high enough to cause a greenhouse effect.

9
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:28,000
Okay, so a 14-year-old kid has outwitted all those thousands of scientists

10
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:31,000
who don't realise that CO2 is a heavy gas

11
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:34,000
and would therefore stay at the bottom of the atmosphere

12
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:36,000
and asphyxiate us all.

13
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:37,000
Well done.

14
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:39,000
Now, on to debunk evolution.

15
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:43,000
And then next is evolution and why it's not real.

16
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:46,000
The only reason they think that we progressed from apes

17
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:49,000
is because they needed an animal that there are not very many of

18
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:56,000
so that we will believe that is the reason that there are not as many of them

19
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,000
and there are so many more of us.

20
00:00:58,000 --> 00:00:59,000
Huh?

21
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:03,000
They never think of giraffes and elephants to being compared to us.

22
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:04,000
I don't know.

23
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,000
Something about giraffes and elephants.

24
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:10,000
Yes, it can be so frustrating arguing with people with the mentality

25
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:13,000
of 14-year-olds you want to chew your own leg off.

26
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:16,000
So in this video I'm going to show you how to take on these

27
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:20,000
conspiracy theorists, creationists and internet junkies

28
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,000
and have fun in the process.

29
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:26,000
I'm not saying my method is foolproof or that I have all the answers,

30
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:29,000
but if you like these ideas, give them a go.

31
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:32,000
It's certainly less painful than chewing off your own leg.

32
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:36,000
Dogshit, uneducated buffoon, dumb **** blind arrogant ex-hippie, asshole.

33
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:37,000
Boys!

34
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:38,000
Boys!

35
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:43,000
The first rule in arguing with assholes is don't treat your adversary like an asshole.

36
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:47,000
Come on, degenerating into a mud fight is what he or she wants

37
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:50,000
because it leads away from your strongest suit,

38
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:53,000
which, if you're fighting on the side of science,

39
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:56,000
is measurable, observable, documented evidence.

40
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:59,000
In many cases these guys are not assholes anyway.

41
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:03,000
They're actually very nice people who have three things in common.

42
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:07,000
They tend to believe whatever they read or misread on anti-science blogs,

43
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:11,000
they can never ever admit that they got something wrong

44
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:14,000
and they all think they know better than the experts.

45
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:18,000
Case in point, I'm not disputing that increasing CO2 will cause warming,

46
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,000
but it all depends on how much.

47
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:23,000
From my own investigation into the subject as a citizen scientist,

48
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:24,000
I think the warming...

49
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:25,000
Thanks, Chipster.

50
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:29,000
What a wonderful word to describe citizens who learn their science from the Internet.

51
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:31,000
Citizen scientists.

52
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:35,000
The term is usually applied to ordinary people who help researchers

53
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:37,000
when a huge amount of data is needed.

54
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:40,000
They don't necessarily have much of a science education

55
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:44,000
and they certainly wouldn't presume to know more than the experts.

56
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:46,000
What Chipster means by a citizen scientist,

57
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,000
and the definition I'm happy to go with,

58
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:52,000
is someone who doesn't necessarily have much of a science education,

59
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:55,000
but who does presume to know more than the experts.

60
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:58,000
And based on what he's read on the Internet and in the Daily Mail

61
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,000
and figured out for himself,

62
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:05,000
the citizen scientist is even bold enough to tell us that the experts are wrong.

63
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:08,000
Which means he believes that either the experts are all incompetent

64
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:12,000
or they're all dishonest and have deliberately fiddled the figures.

65
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:16,000
Citizen scientists never, ever consider a third possibility

66
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:20,000
that maybe the experts know something they don't.

67
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:24,000
The second rule is, well, let's see if you can guess.

68
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:27,000
There's been an effort within the scientific community

69
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:30,000
to censor out information against evolution.

70
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:31,000
So what do you do?

71
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:34,000
Tell her, no there hasn't, that's simply not true.

72
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:38,000
Get into an insulting slanging match and strangle her with a scarf

73
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,000
knitted out of her own self-righteousness.

74
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:45,000
Or three, be polite and ask her what information has been censored out.

75
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:47,000
I go for the third option.

76
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:52,000
So if my first rule in arguing with arseholes is not to treat them like arseholes,

77
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:55,000
the second rule is, don't argue.

78
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:58,000
I know, that rather negates the title of the video, doesn't it?

79
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:02,000
But entering into an argument with a creationist or a conspiracy theorist

80
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:06,000
just gets your blood pressure up and sheds more heat than light.

81
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:11,000
Getting this woman to answer a question like what information has been censored out

82
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:15,000
will not only stump her and highlight her complete ignorance,

83
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:17,000
it'll force the woman to think.

84
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:19,000
Yes, it can happen.

85
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:21,000
Well, how about gravity?

86
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:24,000
What about it?

87
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:27,000
Well, it's a little bit like a magnet.

88
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:30,000
If you have a small magnet and a big magnet,

89
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:33,000
the big magnet's the one that's going to pull the little magnet around

90
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:36,000
and not the little that's going to pull the big one.

91
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:42,000
So if you compare the earth next to the sun, which one's going to make the other one spin around?

92
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:48,000
The sun will make the earth spin around, yeah.

93
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:52,000
Dissecting claims with a scalpel certainly gives people more pause for thought

94
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:55,000
than bludgeoning them with a hammer, like this.

95
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:58,000
You know what your problem is? You're an elitist.

96
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:01,000
You think you're above the American people.

97
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,000
You don't let me finish.

98
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:08,000
What worries your adversary isn't someone who simply shouts opinions,

99
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:13,000
but someone who asks penetrating questions and won't fall for evasive answers.

100
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:17,000
I was entitled to express my views. I was entitled to be consulted.

101
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:18,000
Did you threaten to overrule him?

102
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:23,000
I was not entitled to instruct Derek Lewis and I did not instruct him.

103
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:25,000
Did you threaten to overrule him?

104
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:29,000
The truth of the matter is that Mr Marriott was not suspended.

105
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:30,000
Did you threaten to overrule him?

106
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,000
I did not overrule Derek Lewis.

107
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:33,000
Did you threaten to overrule him?

108
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:36,000
I took advice on what I could or could not do...

109
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,000
Did you threaten to overrule him, Mr Howard?

110
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:40,000
...and I acted stupidly in accordance with that advice.

111
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:41,000
I did not overrule Derek Lewis.

112
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:42,000
Did you threaten to overrule him?

113
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,000
Mr Marriott was not suspended.

114
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,000
Did you threaten to overrule him?

115
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:50,000
I have accounted for my decision to dismiss Derek Lewis...

116
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:51,000
Did you threaten to overrule him?

117
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:54,000
...in great detail before the House of Commons.

118
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:57,000
I note you're not answering the question whether you threatened to overrule him.

119
00:05:57,000 --> 00:06:01,000
The important aspect of this, which it's very clear to bear in mind...

120
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:03,000
I'm sorry, I'm going to be frightfully rude, but...

121
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:04,000
Yes, you can...

122
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:05,000
I'm sorry.

123
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:09,000
You can put the question and I will give you an answer.

124
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:11,000
Did you threaten to overrule him?

125
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:14,000
I discussed this matter with Derek Lewis.

126
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:19,000
Yeah, that's what worries them, single-minded, unflinching pursuit of an answer.

127
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:25,000
Finding that killer question isn't hard because whereas the hallmark of science is consistency,

128
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:28,000
the hallmark of junk science is inconsistency.

129
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:34,000
Why did these amphibians de-evolve, losing their legs?

130
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:41,000
In the end, the answer is irrelevant, because evolution will simply make it fit.

131
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:47,000
Answers are not, because evolution conforms to whatever evidence it is presented with,

132
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:50,000
because it is not science.

133
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:54,000
What? Ian, that's the very point of science.

134
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:56,000
It's meant to fit the evidence.

135
00:06:56,000 --> 00:07:00,000
In other words, evidence comes first, then the conclusion.

136
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:04,000
In junk science, it's the conclusion that comes first.

137
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:09,000
Now, I should point out that in science we talk about the overwhelming preponderance of evidence,

138
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:13,000
because in every field of science there are always going to be a few anomalies,

139
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:16,000
and that's why scientists do research.

140
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:21,000
But the overwhelming preponderance of evidence has to be consistent with the theory.

141
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:26,000
In citizen scientists' world, if the overwhelming preponderance of evidence is inconsistent,

142
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:33,000
then the citizen scientist will either change it, as we've seen many times, or simply ignore it.

143
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:40,000
All you have to do is ask questions to find out where the claims of the citizen scientist and the evidence don't match.

144
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:43,000
When it finally dawns on him that things don't add up,

145
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:47,000
he'll go through contortions to try to avoid answering the question.

146
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:50,000
Here's an example from one of my video fora.

147
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:55,000
Someone called the Clunking Fist accepts that an increase in CO2 causes the Earth to warm up,

148
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:58,000
and that it's done that in the past.

149
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:02,000
But, he claims, these high temperature conditions never stayed around.

150
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:07,000
That's contradicted by the fact that these high temperature conditions lasted millions of years.

151
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:12,000
So the obvious killer question is, how long did these hothouse conditions last?

152
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:18,000
If Clunking Fist admits they lasted millions of years, he's contradicting his own hypothesis.

153
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:23,000
So, rather than admit he's wrong, he has to avoid answering the questions.

154
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:27,000
In all, I had to ask six times, but of course, I never got an answer,

155
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:30,000
just an interesting mix of evasive responses.

156
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:34,000
Now, it's not a difficult question, and the answer's pretty straightforward.

157
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:37,000
When someone goes to such lengths to avoid answering a question,

158
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:40,000
you can be pretty sure he knows he's been caught out.

159
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:45,000
In that case, you may wonder, why don't these guys simply give an honest answer,

160
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:49,000
and abandon a claim that's so obviously inconsistent with the facts?

161
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:54,000
Why go through the painful process of having to avoid a question again and again,

162
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:58,000
when all you have to do is say, whoops, my mistake?

163
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:00,000
I know, weird, isn't it?

164
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:05,000
If a competent scientist discovers he got something wrong, he'll simply acknowledge the error.

165
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:10,000
If that changes the hypothesis, then, as Ian Juby pointed out, the hypothesis changes.

166
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:15,000
But remember, in citizen scientist world, the conclusion comes first,

167
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:19,000
so the conclusion can never, ever be wrong.

168
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:22,000
Refusing to answer six times is nothing.

169
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:25,000
The record so far is held by someone called Kia Bird,

170
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:28,000
after he claimed my climate change videos had ignored scientists

171
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:33,000
with the strongest evidence against what he calls large-scale AGW.

172
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:37,000
It took me 15 attempts to try to get him to give me the names of the scientists

173
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:42,000
I'd supposedly ignored so that I could check out this strongest evidence.

174
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:46,000
The excuses for not revealing them were varied and fascinating.

175
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:49,000
Google it. I've already named them. I refuse to engage in a link war.

176
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:52,000
I accept the science. You don't get to dictate the rules of our chats.

177
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:54,000
This is not my central point. You already know their names.

178
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:57,000
I won't give you the names because you'll attack their credibility.

179
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:59,000
I may have posted the names elsewhere on another thread.

180
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:02,000
I've repeatedly answered your question. You know the names.

181
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:06,000
Now, if I had the strongest evidence for something, I'd only need to be asked once,

182
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:09,000
and I wouldn't hesitate to say what it was.

183
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:12,000
Of course, watching citizen scientists squirm like this

184
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:17,000
does make these encounters far more fun than shouting abuse and getting frustrated.

185
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:19,000
But there's also a serious side to this.

186
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:25,000
Personally, I'm fascinated by how one part of a human brain can know that something's wrong,

187
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:28,000
but the other part still clings to a belief that it's right.

188
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:32,000
It's fascinating to see the variety of excuses that are served up

189
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:35,000
to keep the two halves of the brain from colliding.

190
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:39,000
And there's a polemical reason for asking questions as well.

191
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:44,000
In my experience, citizen scientists often try to keep their statements vague and ambiguous

192
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:47,000
so they can change their claim when they get caught out.

193
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:52,000
In fact, watch for the subtle change of claim as you're questioning them.

194
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:57,000
So ask questions to establish their position very clearly right up front.

195
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:59,000
And it helps to feign ignorance.

196
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:02,000
Remember, these guys think they know better than the experts,

197
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:05,000
so never make out that you're smarter than them.

198
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:07,000
That only invites suspicion.

199
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:10,000
If you want a role model, don't choose a smart-ass like Hannity.

200
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:12,000
Choose this guy.

201
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:28,000
People trying to hide something are much less on guard

202
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:30,000
when they think they're dealing with an idiot.

203
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:34,000
Play dumb, be respectful, and they'll only be too happy

204
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:37,000
to try to teach you their pet theories in detail,

205
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:40,000
played out on a long line knotted with inconsistencies.

206
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:44,000
All you have to do is wait until they've played out enough line

207
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:46,000
and then reel it in.

208
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:48,000
Ignoring evidence is one thing,

209
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:51,000
but when a citizen scientist changes the evidence,

210
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:54,000
then you need to compare his claim to the primary source.

211
00:11:54,000 --> 00:12:00,000
Honestly, I don't trust radiometric and carbon dating at all,

212
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:02,000
but bear with me here.

213
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:05,000
Here's a little article from an article.

214
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:07,000
As with facts and evidence,

215
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:10,000
the citizen scientist will often be evasive and obtuse

216
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:12,000
when asked for a source.

217
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:14,000
For example, data is not a source.

218
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:16,000
I could claim the Sun orbits the Earth

219
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:19,000
and cite astronomical data as my source.

220
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:20,000
It's meaningless.

221
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:24,000
As Z. Shogan did here, ask for the title or author of a paper

222
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:27,000
that reached this conclusion based on that data.

223
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:29,000
You'll usually find there is none.

224
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:31,000
Neil Adams, the comic book illustrator

225
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:33,000
who thinks the Earth is expanding,

226
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:36,000
gives his source for a claim as geology textbooks.

227
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:39,000
Doesn't say which ones or which page number,

228
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:42,000
which is just one step up from the other common answer,

229
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:45,000
everyone knows it, or look it up.

230
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:47,000
For a source to be meaningful,

231
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:49,000
it has to be something you can check,

232
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:51,000
which of course is why the citizen scientists

233
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:53,000
don't like to give it.

234
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:56,000
As soon as they do give a source, their argument falls flat.

235
00:12:56,000 --> 00:13:00,000
A living mollusk shell carbon dated at 2300 years old.

236
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:02,000
Well, here we are 14 years later,

237
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:03,000
carbon dating is still not working.

238
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:05,000
Here's our old friend Kent Hovind

239
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:07,000
trying to show that carbon dating doesn't work

240
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:09,000
because he claims living mollusks

241
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:13,000
were carbon dated at 2300 years old.

242
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:16,000
Unfortunately for Hovind, he gives us a source,

243
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:19,000
a scientific paper by Keith and Anderson.

244
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:21,000
That may impress other citizen scientists

245
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:23,000
who get all their information off the internet,

246
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:27,000
but for people who fact check, this is so easy to debunk.

247
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:30,000
As even the title of the paper suggests,

248
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:32,000
Keith and Anderson weren't trying to carbon date

249
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:33,000
a living mollusk at all.

250
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:35,000
They were carbon dating its shell,

251
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:37,000
and since the carbon in the shell

252
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:40,000
came from very old calcium carbonate in the water,

253
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:42,000
it gave a very old date.

254
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:44,000
The purpose of the paper was to show

255
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:47,000
that you can't derive the age of an aquatic animal

256
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:49,000
by carbon dating.

257
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:51,000
So what do you do when the citizen scientist

258
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:53,000
flat out refuses to give a source?

259
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:57,000
The usual excuse is, I won't engage in a site war.

260
00:13:57,000 --> 00:14:00,000
Well, I have a few solutions.

261
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:02,000
First, try googling the claim verbatim

262
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:05,000
because citizen scientists often can't or won't

263
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:07,000
write their arguments in their own words.

264
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:09,000
They'll just copy and paste it.

265
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:11,000
You'll soon find out where it came from.

266
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:13,000
When a date differs from that expected,

267
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:15,000
researchers readily invent excuses

268
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:17,000
for rejecting the result.

269
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:19,000
The common application of such posterior reasoning

270
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:21,000
shows that radiometric dating...

271
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:22,000
And thanks to Google images,

272
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:24,000
it's also possible to trace the source

273
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:26,000
of faked photos as well.

274
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:29,000
This one, which Jesse Ventura's conspiracy show

275
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:31,000
claimed was taken in the northern hemisphere

276
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:33,000
just before the Boxing Day tsunami...

277
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:35,000
This photo was actually taken just before

278
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:37,000
the big tsunami hit the coast of Indonesia.

279
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:40,000
...turned out to be a poster photo taken in Australia.

280
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:42,000
You can buy it off the internet.

281
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:49,000
Here's a technique I tried when a YouTuber

282
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:52,000
called Laurel Bush refused to give up her source.

283
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:54,000
She messaged me with a familiar internet story

284
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:56,000
that Vikings had been found buried

285
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:58,000
in permafrost in Greenland.

286
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:01,000
After several fruitless attempts at getting a source,

287
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:03,000
she told me of course to look it up,

288
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:06,000
I simply pretended I'd found it on my own.

289
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:08,000
I invented a scientific paper

290
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:10,000
from the University of Copenhagen,

291
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:12,000
and I said that according to the paper,

292
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:13,000
the bodies were skeletons,

293
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:15,000
meaning they must have decomposed

294
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:17,000
and couldn't have been buried in permafrost.

295
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:19,000
All bullshit, of course,

296
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:21,000
but it had the desired effect.

297
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:24,000
About to be gazumped by this twaddle,

298
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:26,000
Laurel Bush immediately came back

299
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:28,000
with a quote to show I was wrong,

300
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:31,000
and bingo, I googled the text she gave me

301
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:32,000
and found her source.

302
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:34,000
Now you'll notice that I'm lumping

303
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:37,000
all these various junk science beliefs together,

304
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:39,000
even though I often get emails from people

305
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:42,000
who tell me they accept the theory of evolution,

306
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:46,000
but not the theory of plate tectonics or climate change.

307
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:48,000
That's like telling me you believe

308
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:50,000
witches fly on broomsticks,

309
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:52,000
but you're not gullible enough to believe

310
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:54,000
that tooth fairies leave money under pillows.

311
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:57,000
It's hardly something to be proud of.

312
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:59,000
Science isn't a pick and mix

313
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:02,000
based on your religious or ideological beliefs.

314
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:04,000
But the reason I lump you all together

315
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:06,000
for the purpose of this video

316
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:08,000
is that your approach in arguing your case

317
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:10,000
is exactly the same,

318
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:13,000
no matter what scientific theory you don't like.

319
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:15,000
Cherry-pick or distort the evidence

320
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:18,000
to fit the conclusion you've already reached.

321
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:20,000
Get your science information from blogs

322
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:22,000
that share your beliefs and never check them.

323
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:24,000
Find a couple of experts who disagree

324
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:26,000
with the majority of researchers

325
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:28,000
and quote them endlessly

326
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:31,000
to give the impression the scientific community is divided.

327
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:34,000
Or get someone with doctor or professor

328
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:37,000
in front of his name and pretend he's an expert,

329
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:39,000
even if he's never published anything

330
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:42,000
in his supposed field of expertise.

331
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:45,000
Say that all you want is for both sides to be heard.

332
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:48,000
Draw up a petition of scientists who support your case,

333
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:51,000
even if they have no qualifications in the relevant field.

334
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:54,000
How to explain the fact that few scientific papers

335
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:57,000
support your case? Claim censorship.

336
00:16:57,000 --> 00:17:00,000
And why don't most scientists support your theories?

337
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:04,000
Because, of course, they're all either dishonest or incompetent.

338
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:08,000
Never entertain the possibility that they know something you don't.

339
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:11,000
Now, I'm sure all the citizen scientists out there will say,

340
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:14,000
well, we can do exactly the same thing, pot-holer.

341
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:17,000
We can ask questions, too, and stump all you science nerds.

342
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:19,000
But it doesn't work that way,

343
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:21,000
because those who accept science

344
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:23,000
aren't coming up with wacky theories of their own

345
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:25,000
that they have to defend.

346
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:28,000
We're simply quoting what's in the scientific literature.

347
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:30,000
Now, you might be able to show

348
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:32,000
that we've erroneously misquoted the science.

349
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:34,000
That's happened to me quite a few times.

350
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:37,000
And then all we have to do is admit that we got it wrong

351
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:39,000
and correct the error. It's that easy.

352
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:43,000
In fact, I wish citizen scientists would ask more questions

353
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:45,000
because then they'd be able to get some answers

354
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:48,000
which they won't find in the places they usually go

355
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:50,000
for information on science.

356
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:52,000
In fact, most of the questions I've seen

357
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:55,000
are incredibly easy to respond to.

358
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:58,000
When I googled questions evolutionists can't answer,

359
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:01,000
I found these question evolution questions,

360
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:03,000
which have even been made into a T-shirt,

361
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:05,000
and a host of other lists.

362
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:07,000
I won't have time to go through all these questions,

363
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:10,000
but you'll find the answers in the video description.

364
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:13,000
When I googled questions warmists can't answer,

365
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:15,000
I found these two.

366
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:17,000
And these rather innocuous questions prompted

367
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:20,000
a few more questions on a discussion forum,

368
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:23,000
also answered in the video description.

369
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:26,000
But if you don't know the answers, don't worry.

370
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:29,000
Remember, you don't have to pretend to be an expert.

371
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:32,000
You simply have to quote what real scientists say.

372
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:35,000
If you don't know, then say you don't know.

373
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:38,000
It's sometimes interesting to then ask the citizen scientist,

374
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:41,000
well, what do the scientists say?

375
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:43,000
He can never admit he doesn't know,

376
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:47,000
so listen to whatever answer he makes up and ask for a source.

377
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:49,000
Despite all this, a lot of people probably still think

378
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:52,000
that citizen scientists sound persuasive.

379
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:55,000
After all, why shouldn't their beliefs be just as valid

380
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:57,000
as the conclusions of real scientists?

381
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:59,000
And why can't their web pages be just as legitimate

382
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:01,000
as peer-reviewed papers published in

383
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:03,000
respected scientific journals?

384
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:06,000
Well, let me just ask one final question.

385
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:09,000
If you're happy to get your science from a citizen scientist,

386
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:12,000
then would you be just as happy to have a root canal

387
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:15,000
performed by a citizen dentist?
