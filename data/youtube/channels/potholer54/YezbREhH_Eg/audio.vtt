00:00.000 --> 00:04.000
Hi, it's Allie, and I'm going to be talking to you about global warming and evolution.

00:04.000 --> 00:05.000
Ooh, goodie.

00:05.000 --> 00:09.000
Now, the first topic is global warming and why it's not real.

00:09.000 --> 00:12.000
The ice caps in Greenland are actually getting thicker.

00:12.000 --> 00:13.000
Huh?

00:13.000 --> 00:16.000
Just like Y2K was not real, but everybody thought we were going to die.

00:16.000 --> 00:22.000
Seventh-grade physics shows that CO2's molecular weight makes it very heavy.

00:22.000 --> 00:24.000
It can't rise high enough to cause a greenhouse effect.

00:24.000 --> 00:28.000
Okay, so a 14-year-old kid has outwitted all those thousands of scientists

00:28.000 --> 00:31.000
who don't realise that CO2 is a heavy gas

00:31.000 --> 00:34.000
and would therefore stay at the bottom of the atmosphere

00:34.000 --> 00:36.000
and asphyxiate us all.

00:36.000 --> 00:37.000
Well done.

00:37.000 --> 00:39.000
Now, on to debunk evolution.

00:39.000 --> 00:43.000
And then next is evolution and why it's not real.

00:43.000 --> 00:46.000
The only reason they think that we progressed from apes

00:46.000 --> 00:49.000
is because they needed an animal that there are not very many of

00:49.000 --> 00:56.000
so that we will believe that is the reason that there are not as many of them

00:56.000 --> 00:58.000
and there are so many more of us.

00:58.000 --> 00:59.000
Huh?

00:59.000 --> 01:03.000
They never think of giraffes and elephants to being compared to us.

01:03.000 --> 01:04.000
I don't know.

01:04.000 --> 01:06.000
Something about giraffes and elephants.

01:06.000 --> 01:10.000
Yes, it can be so frustrating arguing with people with the mentality

01:10.000 --> 01:13.000
of 14-year-olds you want to chew your own leg off.

01:13.000 --> 01:16.000
So in this video I'm going to show you how to take on these

01:16.000 --> 01:20.000
conspiracy theorists, creationists and internet junkies

01:20.000 --> 01:22.000
and have fun in the process.

01:22.000 --> 01:26.000
I'm not saying my method is foolproof or that I have all the answers,

01:26.000 --> 01:29.000
but if you like these ideas, give them a go.

01:29.000 --> 01:32.000
It's certainly less painful than chewing off your own leg.

01:32.000 --> 01:36.000
Dogshit, uneducated buffoon, dumb **** blind arrogant ex-hippie, asshole.

01:36.000 --> 01:37.000
Boys!

01:37.000 --> 01:38.000
Boys!

01:38.000 --> 01:43.000
The first rule in arguing with assholes is don't treat your adversary like an asshole.

01:43.000 --> 01:47.000
Come on, degenerating into a mud fight is what he or she wants

01:47.000 --> 01:50.000
because it leads away from your strongest suit,

01:50.000 --> 01:53.000
which, if you're fighting on the side of science,

01:53.000 --> 01:56.000
is measurable, observable, documented evidence.

01:56.000 --> 01:59.000
In many cases these guys are not assholes anyway.

01:59.000 --> 02:03.000
They're actually very nice people who have three things in common.

02:03.000 --> 02:07.000
They tend to believe whatever they read or misread on anti-science blogs,

02:07.000 --> 02:11.000
they can never ever admit that they got something wrong

02:11.000 --> 02:14.000
and they all think they know better than the experts.

02:14.000 --> 02:18.000
Case in point, I'm not disputing that increasing CO2 will cause warming,

02:18.000 --> 02:20.000
but it all depends on how much.

02:20.000 --> 02:23.000
From my own investigation into the subject as a citizen scientist,

02:23.000 --> 02:24.000
I think the warming...

02:24.000 --> 02:25.000
Thanks, Chipster.

02:25.000 --> 02:29.000
What a wonderful word to describe citizens who learn their science from the Internet.

02:29.000 --> 02:31.000
Citizen scientists.

02:31.000 --> 02:35.000
The term is usually applied to ordinary people who help researchers

02:35.000 --> 02:37.000
when a huge amount of data is needed.

02:37.000 --> 02:40.000
They don't necessarily have much of a science education

02:40.000 --> 02:44.000
and they certainly wouldn't presume to know more than the experts.

02:44.000 --> 02:46.000
What Chipster means by a citizen scientist,

02:46.000 --> 02:48.000
and the definition I'm happy to go with,

02:48.000 --> 02:52.000
is someone who doesn't necessarily have much of a science education,

02:52.000 --> 02:55.000
but who does presume to know more than the experts.

02:55.000 --> 02:58.000
And based on what he's read on the Internet and in the Daily Mail

02:58.000 --> 03:00.000
and figured out for himself,

03:00.000 --> 03:05.000
the citizen scientist is even bold enough to tell us that the experts are wrong.

03:05.000 --> 03:08.000
Which means he believes that either the experts are all incompetent

03:08.000 --> 03:12.000
or they're all dishonest and have deliberately fiddled the figures.

03:12.000 --> 03:16.000
Citizen scientists never, ever consider a third possibility

03:16.000 --> 03:20.000
that maybe the experts know something they don't.

03:21.000 --> 03:24.000
The second rule is, well, let's see if you can guess.

03:24.000 --> 03:27.000
There's been an effort within the scientific community

03:27.000 --> 03:30.000
to censor out information against evolution.

03:30.000 --> 03:31.000
So what do you do?

03:31.000 --> 03:34.000
Tell her, no there hasn't, that's simply not true.

03:34.000 --> 03:38.000
Get into an insulting slanging match and strangle her with a scarf

03:38.000 --> 03:40.000
knitted out of her own self-righteousness.

03:40.000 --> 03:45.000
Or three, be polite and ask her what information has been censored out.

03:45.000 --> 03:47.000
I go for the third option.

03:47.000 --> 03:52.000
So if my first rule in arguing with arseholes is not to treat them like arseholes,

03:52.000 --> 03:55.000
the second rule is, don't argue.

03:55.000 --> 03:58.000
I know, that rather negates the title of the video, doesn't it?

03:58.000 --> 04:02.000
But entering into an argument with a creationist or a conspiracy theorist

04:02.000 --> 04:06.000
just gets your blood pressure up and sheds more heat than light.

04:06.000 --> 04:11.000
Getting this woman to answer a question like what information has been censored out

04:11.000 --> 04:15.000
will not only stump her and highlight her complete ignorance,

04:15.000 --> 04:17.000
it'll force the woman to think.

04:17.000 --> 04:19.000
Yes, it can happen.

04:19.000 --> 04:21.000
Well, how about gravity?

04:23.000 --> 04:24.000
What about it?

04:24.000 --> 04:27.000
Well, it's a little bit like a magnet.

04:27.000 --> 04:30.000
If you have a small magnet and a big magnet,

04:30.000 --> 04:33.000
the big magnet's the one that's going to pull the little magnet around

04:33.000 --> 04:36.000
and not the little that's going to pull the big one.

04:36.000 --> 04:42.000
So if you compare the earth next to the sun, which one's going to make the other one spin around?

04:46.000 --> 04:48.000
The sun will make the earth spin around, yeah.

04:48.000 --> 04:52.000
Dissecting claims with a scalpel certainly gives people more pause for thought

04:52.000 --> 04:55.000
than bludgeoning them with a hammer, like this.

04:55.000 --> 04:58.000
You know what your problem is? You're an elitist.

04:58.000 --> 05:01.000
You think you're above the American people.

05:02.000 --> 05:04.000
You don't let me finish.

05:04.000 --> 05:08.000
What worries your adversary isn't someone who simply shouts opinions,

05:08.000 --> 05:13.000
but someone who asks penetrating questions and won't fall for evasive answers.

05:13.000 --> 05:17.000
I was entitled to express my views. I was entitled to be consulted.

05:17.000 --> 05:18.000
Did you threaten to overrule him?

05:18.000 --> 05:23.000
I was not entitled to instruct Derek Lewis and I did not instruct him.

05:23.000 --> 05:25.000
Did you threaten to overrule him?

05:25.000 --> 05:29.000
The truth of the matter is that Mr Marriott was not suspended.

05:29.000 --> 05:30.000
Did you threaten to overrule him?

05:30.000 --> 05:32.000
I did not overrule Derek Lewis.

05:32.000 --> 05:33.000
Did you threaten to overrule him?

05:33.000 --> 05:36.000
I took advice on what I could or could not do...

05:36.000 --> 05:38.000
Did you threaten to overrule him, Mr Howard?

05:38.000 --> 05:40.000
...and I acted stupidly in accordance with that advice.

05:40.000 --> 05:41.000
I did not overrule Derek Lewis.

05:41.000 --> 05:42.000
Did you threaten to overrule him?

05:42.000 --> 05:44.000
Mr Marriott was not suspended.

05:44.000 --> 05:46.000
Did you threaten to overrule him?

05:46.000 --> 05:50.000
I have accounted for my decision to dismiss Derek Lewis...

05:50.000 --> 05:51.000
Did you threaten to overrule him?

05:51.000 --> 05:54.000
...in great detail before the House of Commons.

05:54.000 --> 05:57.000
I note you're not answering the question whether you threatened to overrule him.

05:57.000 --> 06:01.000
The important aspect of this, which it's very clear to bear in mind...

06:01.000 --> 06:03.000
I'm sorry, I'm going to be frightfully rude, but...

06:03.000 --> 06:04.000
Yes, you can...

06:04.000 --> 06:05.000
I'm sorry.

06:05.000 --> 06:09.000
You can put the question and I will give you an answer.

06:09.000 --> 06:11.000
Did you threaten to overrule him?

06:11.000 --> 06:14.000
I discussed this matter with Derek Lewis.

06:14.000 --> 06:19.000
Yeah, that's what worries them, single-minded, unflinching pursuit of an answer.

06:19.000 --> 06:25.000
Finding that killer question isn't hard because whereas the hallmark of science is consistency,

06:25.000 --> 06:28.000
the hallmark of junk science is inconsistency.

06:28.000 --> 06:34.000
Why did these amphibians de-evolve, losing their legs?

06:34.000 --> 06:41.000
In the end, the answer is irrelevant, because evolution will simply make it fit.

06:41.000 --> 06:47.000
Answers are not, because evolution conforms to whatever evidence it is presented with,

06:47.000 --> 06:50.000
because it is not science.

06:50.000 --> 06:54.000
What? Ian, that's the very point of science.

06:54.000 --> 06:56.000
It's meant to fit the evidence.

06:56.000 --> 07:00.000
In other words, evidence comes first, then the conclusion.

07:00.000 --> 07:04.000
In junk science, it's the conclusion that comes first.

07:04.000 --> 07:09.000
Now, I should point out that in science we talk about the overwhelming preponderance of evidence,

07:09.000 --> 07:13.000
because in every field of science there are always going to be a few anomalies,

07:13.000 --> 07:16.000
and that's why scientists do research.

07:16.000 --> 07:21.000
But the overwhelming preponderance of evidence has to be consistent with the theory.

07:21.000 --> 07:26.000
In citizen scientists' world, if the overwhelming preponderance of evidence is inconsistent,

07:26.000 --> 07:33.000
then the citizen scientist will either change it, as we've seen many times, or simply ignore it.

07:33.000 --> 07:40.000
All you have to do is ask questions to find out where the claims of the citizen scientist and the evidence don't match.

07:40.000 --> 07:43.000
When it finally dawns on him that things don't add up,

07:43.000 --> 07:47.000
he'll go through contortions to try to avoid answering the question.

07:47.000 --> 07:50.000
Here's an example from one of my video fora.

07:50.000 --> 07:55.000
Someone called the Clunking Fist accepts that an increase in CO2 causes the Earth to warm up,

07:55.000 --> 07:58.000
and that it's done that in the past.

07:58.000 --> 08:02.000
But, he claims, these high temperature conditions never stayed around.

08:02.000 --> 08:07.000
That's contradicted by the fact that these high temperature conditions lasted millions of years.

08:07.000 --> 08:12.000
So the obvious killer question is, how long did these hothouse conditions last?

08:12.000 --> 08:18.000
If Clunking Fist admits they lasted millions of years, he's contradicting his own hypothesis.

08:18.000 --> 08:23.000
So, rather than admit he's wrong, he has to avoid answering the questions.

08:23.000 --> 08:27.000
In all, I had to ask six times, but of course, I never got an answer,

08:27.000 --> 08:30.000
just an interesting mix of evasive responses.

08:30.000 --> 08:34.000
Now, it's not a difficult question, and the answer's pretty straightforward.

08:34.000 --> 08:37.000
When someone goes to such lengths to avoid answering a question,

08:37.000 --> 08:40.000
you can be pretty sure he knows he's been caught out.

08:40.000 --> 08:45.000
In that case, you may wonder, why don't these guys simply give an honest answer,

08:45.000 --> 08:49.000
and abandon a claim that's so obviously inconsistent with the facts?

08:49.000 --> 08:54.000
Why go through the painful process of having to avoid a question again and again,

08:54.000 --> 08:58.000
when all you have to do is say, whoops, my mistake?

08:58.000 --> 09:00.000
I know, weird, isn't it?

09:00.000 --> 09:05.000
If a competent scientist discovers he got something wrong, he'll simply acknowledge the error.

09:05.000 --> 09:10.000
If that changes the hypothesis, then, as Ian Juby pointed out, the hypothesis changes.

09:10.000 --> 09:15.000
But remember, in citizen scientist world, the conclusion comes first,

09:15.000 --> 09:19.000
so the conclusion can never, ever be wrong.

09:19.000 --> 09:22.000
Refusing to answer six times is nothing.

09:22.000 --> 09:25.000
The record so far is held by someone called Kia Bird,

09:25.000 --> 09:28.000
after he claimed my climate change videos had ignored scientists

09:28.000 --> 09:33.000
with the strongest evidence against what he calls large-scale AGW.

09:33.000 --> 09:37.000
It took me 15 attempts to try to get him to give me the names of the scientists

09:37.000 --> 09:42.000
I'd supposedly ignored so that I could check out this strongest evidence.

09:42.000 --> 09:46.000
The excuses for not revealing them were varied and fascinating.

09:46.000 --> 09:49.000
Google it. I've already named them. I refuse to engage in a link war.

09:49.000 --> 09:52.000
I accept the science. You don't get to dictate the rules of our chats.

09:52.000 --> 09:54.000
This is not my central point. You already know their names.

09:54.000 --> 09:57.000
I won't give you the names because you'll attack their credibility.

09:57.000 --> 09:59.000
I may have posted the names elsewhere on another thread.

09:59.000 --> 10:02.000
I've repeatedly answered your question. You know the names.

10:02.000 --> 10:06.000
Now, if I had the strongest evidence for something, I'd only need to be asked once,

10:06.000 --> 10:09.000
and I wouldn't hesitate to say what it was.

10:09.000 --> 10:12.000
Of course, watching citizen scientists squirm like this

10:12.000 --> 10:17.000
does make these encounters far more fun than shouting abuse and getting frustrated.

10:17.000 --> 10:19.000
But there's also a serious side to this.

10:19.000 --> 10:25.000
Personally, I'm fascinated by how one part of a human brain can know that something's wrong,

10:25.000 --> 10:28.000
but the other part still clings to a belief that it's right.

10:28.000 --> 10:32.000
It's fascinating to see the variety of excuses that are served up

10:32.000 --> 10:35.000
to keep the two halves of the brain from colliding.

10:35.000 --> 10:39.000
And there's a polemical reason for asking questions as well.

10:39.000 --> 10:44.000
In my experience, citizen scientists often try to keep their statements vague and ambiguous

10:44.000 --> 10:47.000
so they can change their claim when they get caught out.

10:47.000 --> 10:52.000
In fact, watch for the subtle change of claim as you're questioning them.

10:52.000 --> 10:57.000
So ask questions to establish their position very clearly right up front.

10:57.000 --> 10:59.000
And it helps to feign ignorance.

10:59.000 --> 11:02.000
Remember, these guys think they know better than the experts,

11:02.000 --> 11:05.000
so never make out that you're smarter than them.

11:05.000 --> 11:07.000
That only invites suspicion.

11:07.000 --> 11:10.000
If you want a role model, don't choose a smart-ass like Hannity.

11:10.000 --> 11:12.000
Choose this guy.

11:25.000 --> 11:28.000
People trying to hide something are much less on guard

11:28.000 --> 11:30.000
when they think they're dealing with an idiot.

11:30.000 --> 11:34.000
Play dumb, be respectful, and they'll only be too happy

11:34.000 --> 11:37.000
to try to teach you their pet theories in detail,

11:37.000 --> 11:40.000
played out on a long line knotted with inconsistencies.

11:40.000 --> 11:44.000
All you have to do is wait until they've played out enough line

11:44.000 --> 11:46.000
and then reel it in.

11:46.000 --> 11:48.000
Ignoring evidence is one thing,

11:48.000 --> 11:51.000
but when a citizen scientist changes the evidence,

11:51.000 --> 11:54.000
then you need to compare his claim to the primary source.

11:54.000 --> 12:00.000
Honestly, I don't trust radiometric and carbon dating at all,

12:00.000 --> 12:02.000
but bear with me here.

12:02.000 --> 12:05.000
Here's a little article from an article.

12:05.000 --> 12:07.000
As with facts and evidence,

12:07.000 --> 12:10.000
the citizen scientist will often be evasive and obtuse

12:10.000 --> 12:12.000
when asked for a source.

12:12.000 --> 12:14.000
For example, data is not a source.

12:14.000 --> 12:16.000
I could claim the Sun orbits the Earth

12:16.000 --> 12:19.000
and cite astronomical data as my source.

12:19.000 --> 12:20.000
It's meaningless.

12:20.000 --> 12:24.000
As Z. Shogan did here, ask for the title or author of a paper

12:24.000 --> 12:27.000
that reached this conclusion based on that data.

12:27.000 --> 12:29.000
You'll usually find there is none.

12:29.000 --> 12:31.000
Neil Adams, the comic book illustrator

12:31.000 --> 12:33.000
who thinks the Earth is expanding,

12:33.000 --> 12:36.000
gives his source for a claim as geology textbooks.

12:36.000 --> 12:39.000
Doesn't say which ones or which page number,

12:39.000 --> 12:42.000
which is just one step up from the other common answer,

12:42.000 --> 12:45.000
everyone knows it, or look it up.

12:45.000 --> 12:47.000
For a source to be meaningful,

12:47.000 --> 12:49.000
it has to be something you can check,

12:49.000 --> 12:51.000
which of course is why the citizen scientists

12:51.000 --> 12:53.000
don't like to give it.

12:53.000 --> 12:56.000
As soon as they do give a source, their argument falls flat.

12:56.000 --> 13:00.000
A living mollusk shell carbon dated at 2300 years old.

13:00.000 --> 13:02.000
Well, here we are 14 years later,

13:02.000 --> 13:03.000
carbon dating is still not working.

13:03.000 --> 13:05.000
Here's our old friend Kent Hovind

13:05.000 --> 13:07.000
trying to show that carbon dating doesn't work

13:07.000 --> 13:09.000
because he claims living mollusks

13:09.000 --> 13:13.000
were carbon dated at 2300 years old.

13:13.000 --> 13:16.000
Unfortunately for Hovind, he gives us a source,

13:16.000 --> 13:19.000
a scientific paper by Keith and Anderson.

13:19.000 --> 13:21.000
That may impress other citizen scientists

13:21.000 --> 13:23.000
who get all their information off the internet,

13:23.000 --> 13:27.000
but for people who fact check, this is so easy to debunk.

13:27.000 --> 13:30.000
As even the title of the paper suggests,

13:30.000 --> 13:32.000
Keith and Anderson weren't trying to carbon date

13:32.000 --> 13:33.000
a living mollusk at all.

13:33.000 --> 13:35.000
They were carbon dating its shell,

13:35.000 --> 13:37.000
and since the carbon in the shell

13:37.000 --> 13:40.000
came from very old calcium carbonate in the water,

13:40.000 --> 13:42.000
it gave a very old date.

13:42.000 --> 13:44.000
The purpose of the paper was to show

13:44.000 --> 13:47.000
that you can't derive the age of an aquatic animal

13:47.000 --> 13:49.000
by carbon dating.

13:49.000 --> 13:51.000
So what do you do when the citizen scientist

13:51.000 --> 13:53.000
flat out refuses to give a source?

13:53.000 --> 13:57.000
The usual excuse is, I won't engage in a site war.

13:57.000 --> 14:00.000
Well, I have a few solutions.

14:00.000 --> 14:02.000
First, try googling the claim verbatim

14:02.000 --> 14:05.000
because citizen scientists often can't or won't

14:05.000 --> 14:07.000
write their arguments in their own words.

14:07.000 --> 14:09.000
They'll just copy and paste it.

14:09.000 --> 14:11.000
You'll soon find out where it came from.

14:11.000 --> 14:13.000
When a date differs from that expected,

14:13.000 --> 14:15.000
researchers readily invent excuses

14:15.000 --> 14:17.000
for rejecting the result.

14:17.000 --> 14:19.000
The common application of such posterior reasoning

14:19.000 --> 14:21.000
shows that radiometric dating...

14:21.000 --> 14:22.000
And thanks to Google images,

14:22.000 --> 14:24.000
it's also possible to trace the source

14:24.000 --> 14:26.000
of faked photos as well.

14:26.000 --> 14:29.000
This one, which Jesse Ventura's conspiracy show

14:29.000 --> 14:31.000
claimed was taken in the northern hemisphere

14:31.000 --> 14:33.000
just before the Boxing Day tsunami...

14:33.000 --> 14:35.000
This photo was actually taken just before

14:35.000 --> 14:37.000
the big tsunami hit the coast of Indonesia.

14:37.000 --> 14:40.000
...turned out to be a poster photo taken in Australia.

14:40.000 --> 14:42.000
You can buy it off the internet.

14:43.000 --> 14:49.000
Here's a technique I tried when a YouTuber

14:49.000 --> 14:52.000
called Laurel Bush refused to give up her source.

14:52.000 --> 14:54.000
She messaged me with a familiar internet story

14:54.000 --> 14:56.000
that Vikings had been found buried

14:56.000 --> 14:58.000
in permafrost in Greenland.

14:58.000 --> 15:01.000
After several fruitless attempts at getting a source,

15:01.000 --> 15:03.000
she told me of course to look it up,

15:03.000 --> 15:06.000
I simply pretended I'd found it on my own.

15:06.000 --> 15:08.000
I invented a scientific paper

15:08.000 --> 15:10.000
from the University of Copenhagen,

15:10.000 --> 15:12.000
and I said that according to the paper,

15:12.000 --> 15:13.000
the bodies were skeletons,

15:13.000 --> 15:15.000
meaning they must have decomposed

15:15.000 --> 15:17.000
and couldn't have been buried in permafrost.

15:17.000 --> 15:19.000
All bullshit, of course,

15:19.000 --> 15:21.000
but it had the desired effect.

15:21.000 --> 15:24.000
About to be gazumped by this twaddle,

15:24.000 --> 15:26.000
Laurel Bush immediately came back

15:26.000 --> 15:28.000
with a quote to show I was wrong,

15:28.000 --> 15:31.000
and bingo, I googled the text she gave me

15:31.000 --> 15:32.000
and found her source.

15:32.000 --> 15:34.000
Now you'll notice that I'm lumping

15:34.000 --> 15:37.000
all these various junk science beliefs together,

15:37.000 --> 15:39.000
even though I often get emails from people

15:39.000 --> 15:42.000
who tell me they accept the theory of evolution,

15:42.000 --> 15:46.000
but not the theory of plate tectonics or climate change.

15:46.000 --> 15:48.000
That's like telling me you believe

15:48.000 --> 15:50.000
witches fly on broomsticks,

15:50.000 --> 15:52.000
but you're not gullible enough to believe

15:52.000 --> 15:54.000
that tooth fairies leave money under pillows.

15:54.000 --> 15:57.000
It's hardly something to be proud of.

15:57.000 --> 15:59.000
Science isn't a pick and mix

15:59.000 --> 16:02.000
based on your religious or ideological beliefs.

16:02.000 --> 16:04.000
But the reason I lump you all together

16:04.000 --> 16:06.000
for the purpose of this video

16:06.000 --> 16:08.000
is that your approach in arguing your case

16:08.000 --> 16:10.000
is exactly the same,

16:10.000 --> 16:13.000
no matter what scientific theory you don't like.

16:13.000 --> 16:15.000
Cherry-pick or distort the evidence

16:15.000 --> 16:18.000
to fit the conclusion you've already reached.

16:18.000 --> 16:20.000
Get your science information from blogs

16:20.000 --> 16:22.000
that share your beliefs and never check them.

16:22.000 --> 16:24.000
Find a couple of experts who disagree

16:24.000 --> 16:26.000
with the majority of researchers

16:26.000 --> 16:28.000
and quote them endlessly

16:28.000 --> 16:31.000
to give the impression the scientific community is divided.

16:31.000 --> 16:34.000
Or get someone with doctor or professor

16:34.000 --> 16:37.000
in front of his name and pretend he's an expert,

16:37.000 --> 16:39.000
even if he's never published anything

16:39.000 --> 16:42.000
in his supposed field of expertise.

16:42.000 --> 16:45.000
Say that all you want is for both sides to be heard.

16:45.000 --> 16:48.000
Draw up a petition of scientists who support your case,

16:48.000 --> 16:51.000
even if they have no qualifications in the relevant field.

16:51.000 --> 16:54.000
How to explain the fact that few scientific papers

16:54.000 --> 16:57.000
support your case? Claim censorship.

16:57.000 --> 17:00.000
And why don't most scientists support your theories?

17:00.000 --> 17:04.000
Because, of course, they're all either dishonest or incompetent.

17:04.000 --> 17:08.000
Never entertain the possibility that they know something you don't.

17:08.000 --> 17:11.000
Now, I'm sure all the citizen scientists out there will say,

17:11.000 --> 17:14.000
well, we can do exactly the same thing, pot-holer.

17:14.000 --> 17:17.000
We can ask questions, too, and stump all you science nerds.

17:17.000 --> 17:19.000
But it doesn't work that way,

17:19.000 --> 17:21.000
because those who accept science

17:21.000 --> 17:23.000
aren't coming up with wacky theories of their own

17:23.000 --> 17:25.000
that they have to defend.

17:25.000 --> 17:28.000
We're simply quoting what's in the scientific literature.

17:28.000 --> 17:30.000
Now, you might be able to show

17:30.000 --> 17:32.000
that we've erroneously misquoted the science.

17:32.000 --> 17:34.000
That's happened to me quite a few times.

17:34.000 --> 17:37.000
And then all we have to do is admit that we got it wrong

17:37.000 --> 17:39.000
and correct the error. It's that easy.

17:39.000 --> 17:43.000
In fact, I wish citizen scientists would ask more questions

17:43.000 --> 17:45.000
because then they'd be able to get some answers

17:45.000 --> 17:48.000
which they won't find in the places they usually go

17:48.000 --> 17:50.000
for information on science.

17:50.000 --> 17:52.000
In fact, most of the questions I've seen

17:52.000 --> 17:55.000
are incredibly easy to respond to.

17:55.000 --> 17:58.000
When I googled questions evolutionists can't answer,

17:58.000 --> 18:01.000
I found these question evolution questions,

18:01.000 --> 18:03.000
which have even been made into a T-shirt,

18:03.000 --> 18:05.000
and a host of other lists.

18:05.000 --> 18:07.000
I won't have time to go through all these questions,

18:07.000 --> 18:10.000
but you'll find the answers in the video description.

18:10.000 --> 18:13.000
When I googled questions warmists can't answer,

18:13.000 --> 18:15.000
I found these two.

18:15.000 --> 18:17.000
And these rather innocuous questions prompted

18:17.000 --> 18:20.000
a few more questions on a discussion forum,

18:20.000 --> 18:23.000
also answered in the video description.

18:23.000 --> 18:26.000
But if you don't know the answers, don't worry.

18:26.000 --> 18:29.000
Remember, you don't have to pretend to be an expert.

18:29.000 --> 18:32.000
You simply have to quote what real scientists say.

18:32.000 --> 18:35.000
If you don't know, then say you don't know.

18:35.000 --> 18:38.000
It's sometimes interesting to then ask the citizen scientist,

18:38.000 --> 18:41.000
well, what do the scientists say?

18:41.000 --> 18:43.000
He can never admit he doesn't know,

18:43.000 --> 18:47.000
so listen to whatever answer he makes up and ask for a source.

18:47.000 --> 18:49.000
Despite all this, a lot of people probably still think

18:49.000 --> 18:52.000
that citizen scientists sound persuasive.

18:52.000 --> 18:55.000
After all, why shouldn't their beliefs be just as valid

18:55.000 --> 18:57.000
as the conclusions of real scientists?

18:57.000 --> 18:59.000
And why can't their web pages be just as legitimate

18:59.000 --> 19:01.000
as peer-reviewed papers published in

19:01.000 --> 19:03.000
respected scientific journals?

19:03.000 --> 19:06.000
Well, let me just ask one final question.

19:06.000 --> 19:09.000
If you're happy to get your science from a citizen scientist,

19:09.000 --> 19:12.000
then would you be just as happy to have a root canal

19:12.000 --> 19:15.000
performed by a citizen dentist?
