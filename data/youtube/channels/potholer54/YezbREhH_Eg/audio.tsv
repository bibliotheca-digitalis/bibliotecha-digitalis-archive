0	4000	Hi, it's Allie, and I'm going to be talking to you about global warming and evolution.
4000	5000	Ooh, goodie.
5000	9000	Now, the first topic is global warming and why it's not real.
9000	12000	The ice caps in Greenland are actually getting thicker.
12000	13000	Huh?
13000	16000	Just like Y2K was not real, but everybody thought we were going to die.
16000	22000	Seventh-grade physics shows that CO2's molecular weight makes it very heavy.
22000	24000	It can't rise high enough to cause a greenhouse effect.
24000	28000	Okay, so a 14-year-old kid has outwitted all those thousands of scientists
28000	31000	who don't realise that CO2 is a heavy gas
31000	34000	and would therefore stay at the bottom of the atmosphere
34000	36000	and asphyxiate us all.
36000	37000	Well done.
37000	39000	Now, on to debunk evolution.
39000	43000	And then next is evolution and why it's not real.
43000	46000	The only reason they think that we progressed from apes
46000	49000	is because they needed an animal that there are not very many of
49000	56000	so that we will believe that is the reason that there are not as many of them
56000	58000	and there are so many more of us.
58000	59000	Huh?
59000	63000	They never think of giraffes and elephants to being compared to us.
63000	64000	I don't know.
64000	66000	Something about giraffes and elephants.
66000	70000	Yes, it can be so frustrating arguing with people with the mentality
70000	73000	of 14-year-olds you want to chew your own leg off.
73000	76000	So in this video I'm going to show you how to take on these
76000	80000	conspiracy theorists, creationists and internet junkies
80000	82000	and have fun in the process.
82000	86000	I'm not saying my method is foolproof or that I have all the answers,
86000	89000	but if you like these ideas, give them a go.
89000	92000	It's certainly less painful than chewing off your own leg.
92000	96000	Dogshit, uneducated buffoon, dumb **** blind arrogant ex-hippie, asshole.
96000	97000	Boys!
97000	98000	Boys!
98000	103000	The first rule in arguing with assholes is don't treat your adversary like an asshole.
103000	107000	Come on, degenerating into a mud fight is what he or she wants
107000	110000	because it leads away from your strongest suit,
110000	113000	which, if you're fighting on the side of science,
113000	116000	is measurable, observable, documented evidence.
116000	119000	In many cases these guys are not assholes anyway.
119000	123000	They're actually very nice people who have three things in common.
123000	127000	They tend to believe whatever they read or misread on anti-science blogs,
127000	131000	they can never ever admit that they got something wrong
131000	134000	and they all think they know better than the experts.
134000	138000	Case in point, I'm not disputing that increasing CO2 will cause warming,
138000	140000	but it all depends on how much.
140000	143000	From my own investigation into the subject as a citizen scientist,
143000	144000	I think the warming...
144000	145000	Thanks, Chipster.
145000	149000	What a wonderful word to describe citizens who learn their science from the Internet.
149000	151000	Citizen scientists.
151000	155000	The term is usually applied to ordinary people who help researchers
155000	157000	when a huge amount of data is needed.
157000	160000	They don't necessarily have much of a science education
160000	164000	and they certainly wouldn't presume to know more than the experts.
164000	166000	What Chipster means by a citizen scientist,
166000	168000	and the definition I'm happy to go with,
168000	172000	is someone who doesn't necessarily have much of a science education,
172000	175000	but who does presume to know more than the experts.
175000	178000	And based on what he's read on the Internet and in the Daily Mail
178000	180000	and figured out for himself,
180000	185000	the citizen scientist is even bold enough to tell us that the experts are wrong.
185000	188000	Which means he believes that either the experts are all incompetent
188000	192000	or they're all dishonest and have deliberately fiddled the figures.
192000	196000	Citizen scientists never, ever consider a third possibility
196000	200000	that maybe the experts know something they don't.
201000	204000	The second rule is, well, let's see if you can guess.
204000	207000	There's been an effort within the scientific community
207000	210000	to censor out information against evolution.
210000	211000	So what do you do?
211000	214000	Tell her, no there hasn't, that's simply not true.
214000	218000	Get into an insulting slanging match and strangle her with a scarf
218000	220000	knitted out of her own self-righteousness.
220000	225000	Or three, be polite and ask her what information has been censored out.
225000	227000	I go for the third option.
227000	232000	So if my first rule in arguing with arseholes is not to treat them like arseholes,
232000	235000	the second rule is, don't argue.
235000	238000	I know, that rather negates the title of the video, doesn't it?
238000	242000	But entering into an argument with a creationist or a conspiracy theorist
242000	246000	just gets your blood pressure up and sheds more heat than light.
246000	251000	Getting this woman to answer a question like what information has been censored out
251000	255000	will not only stump her and highlight her complete ignorance,
255000	257000	it'll force the woman to think.
257000	259000	Yes, it can happen.
259000	261000	Well, how about gravity?
263000	264000	What about it?
264000	267000	Well, it's a little bit like a magnet.
267000	270000	If you have a small magnet and a big magnet,
270000	273000	the big magnet's the one that's going to pull the little magnet around
273000	276000	and not the little that's going to pull the big one.
276000	282000	So if you compare the earth next to the sun, which one's going to make the other one spin around?
286000	288000	The sun will make the earth spin around, yeah.
288000	292000	Dissecting claims with a scalpel certainly gives people more pause for thought
292000	295000	than bludgeoning them with a hammer, like this.
295000	298000	You know what your problem is? You're an elitist.
298000	301000	You think you're above the American people.
302000	304000	You don't let me finish.
304000	308000	What worries your adversary isn't someone who simply shouts opinions,
308000	313000	but someone who asks penetrating questions and won't fall for evasive answers.
313000	317000	I was entitled to express my views. I was entitled to be consulted.
317000	318000	Did you threaten to overrule him?
318000	323000	I was not entitled to instruct Derek Lewis and I did not instruct him.
323000	325000	Did you threaten to overrule him?
325000	329000	The truth of the matter is that Mr Marriott was not suspended.
329000	330000	Did you threaten to overrule him?
330000	332000	I did not overrule Derek Lewis.
332000	333000	Did you threaten to overrule him?
333000	336000	I took advice on what I could or could not do...
336000	338000	Did you threaten to overrule him, Mr Howard?
338000	340000	...and I acted stupidly in accordance with that advice.
340000	341000	I did not overrule Derek Lewis.
341000	342000	Did you threaten to overrule him?
342000	344000	Mr Marriott was not suspended.
344000	346000	Did you threaten to overrule him?
346000	350000	I have accounted for my decision to dismiss Derek Lewis...
350000	351000	Did you threaten to overrule him?
351000	354000	...in great detail before the House of Commons.
354000	357000	I note you're not answering the question whether you threatened to overrule him.
357000	361000	The important aspect of this, which it's very clear to bear in mind...
361000	363000	I'm sorry, I'm going to be frightfully rude, but...
363000	364000	Yes, you can...
364000	365000	I'm sorry.
365000	369000	You can put the question and I will give you an answer.
369000	371000	Did you threaten to overrule him?
371000	374000	I discussed this matter with Derek Lewis.
374000	379000	Yeah, that's what worries them, single-minded, unflinching pursuit of an answer.
379000	385000	Finding that killer question isn't hard because whereas the hallmark of science is consistency,
385000	388000	the hallmark of junk science is inconsistency.
388000	394000	Why did these amphibians de-evolve, losing their legs?
394000	401000	In the end, the answer is irrelevant, because evolution will simply make it fit.
401000	407000	Answers are not, because evolution conforms to whatever evidence it is presented with,
407000	410000	because it is not science.
410000	414000	What? Ian, that's the very point of science.
414000	416000	It's meant to fit the evidence.
416000	420000	In other words, evidence comes first, then the conclusion.
420000	424000	In junk science, it's the conclusion that comes first.
424000	429000	Now, I should point out that in science we talk about the overwhelming preponderance of evidence,
429000	433000	because in every field of science there are always going to be a few anomalies,
433000	436000	and that's why scientists do research.
436000	441000	But the overwhelming preponderance of evidence has to be consistent with the theory.
441000	446000	In citizen scientists' world, if the overwhelming preponderance of evidence is inconsistent,
446000	453000	then the citizen scientist will either change it, as we've seen many times, or simply ignore it.
453000	460000	All you have to do is ask questions to find out where the claims of the citizen scientist and the evidence don't match.
460000	463000	When it finally dawns on him that things don't add up,
463000	467000	he'll go through contortions to try to avoid answering the question.
467000	470000	Here's an example from one of my video fora.
470000	475000	Someone called the Clunking Fist accepts that an increase in CO2 causes the Earth to warm up,
475000	478000	and that it's done that in the past.
478000	482000	But, he claims, these high temperature conditions never stayed around.
482000	487000	That's contradicted by the fact that these high temperature conditions lasted millions of years.
487000	492000	So the obvious killer question is, how long did these hothouse conditions last?
492000	498000	If Clunking Fist admits they lasted millions of years, he's contradicting his own hypothesis.
498000	503000	So, rather than admit he's wrong, he has to avoid answering the questions.
503000	507000	In all, I had to ask six times, but of course, I never got an answer,
507000	510000	just an interesting mix of evasive responses.
510000	514000	Now, it's not a difficult question, and the answer's pretty straightforward.
514000	517000	When someone goes to such lengths to avoid answering a question,
517000	520000	you can be pretty sure he knows he's been caught out.
520000	525000	In that case, you may wonder, why don't these guys simply give an honest answer,
525000	529000	and abandon a claim that's so obviously inconsistent with the facts?
529000	534000	Why go through the painful process of having to avoid a question again and again,
534000	538000	when all you have to do is say, whoops, my mistake?
538000	540000	I know, weird, isn't it?
540000	545000	If a competent scientist discovers he got something wrong, he'll simply acknowledge the error.
545000	550000	If that changes the hypothesis, then, as Ian Juby pointed out, the hypothesis changes.
550000	555000	But remember, in citizen scientist world, the conclusion comes first,
555000	559000	so the conclusion can never, ever be wrong.
559000	562000	Refusing to answer six times is nothing.
562000	565000	The record so far is held by someone called Kia Bird,
565000	568000	after he claimed my climate change videos had ignored scientists
568000	573000	with the strongest evidence against what he calls large-scale AGW.
573000	577000	It took me 15 attempts to try to get him to give me the names of the scientists
577000	582000	I'd supposedly ignored so that I could check out this strongest evidence.
582000	586000	The excuses for not revealing them were varied and fascinating.
586000	589000	Google it. I've already named them. I refuse to engage in a link war.
589000	592000	I accept the science. You don't get to dictate the rules of our chats.
592000	594000	This is not my central point. You already know their names.
594000	597000	I won't give you the names because you'll attack their credibility.
597000	599000	I may have posted the names elsewhere on another thread.
599000	602000	I've repeatedly answered your question. You know the names.
602000	606000	Now, if I had the strongest evidence for something, I'd only need to be asked once,
606000	609000	and I wouldn't hesitate to say what it was.
609000	612000	Of course, watching citizen scientists squirm like this
612000	617000	does make these encounters far more fun than shouting abuse and getting frustrated.
617000	619000	But there's also a serious side to this.
619000	625000	Personally, I'm fascinated by how one part of a human brain can know that something's wrong,
625000	628000	but the other part still clings to a belief that it's right.
628000	632000	It's fascinating to see the variety of excuses that are served up
632000	635000	to keep the two halves of the brain from colliding.
635000	639000	And there's a polemical reason for asking questions as well.
639000	644000	In my experience, citizen scientists often try to keep their statements vague and ambiguous
644000	647000	so they can change their claim when they get caught out.
647000	652000	In fact, watch for the subtle change of claim as you're questioning them.
652000	657000	So ask questions to establish their position very clearly right up front.
657000	659000	And it helps to feign ignorance.
659000	662000	Remember, these guys think they know better than the experts,
662000	665000	so never make out that you're smarter than them.
665000	667000	That only invites suspicion.
667000	670000	If you want a role model, don't choose a smart-ass like Hannity.
670000	672000	Choose this guy.
685000	688000	People trying to hide something are much less on guard
688000	690000	when they think they're dealing with an idiot.
690000	694000	Play dumb, be respectful, and they'll only be too happy
694000	697000	to try to teach you their pet theories in detail,
697000	700000	played out on a long line knotted with inconsistencies.
700000	704000	All you have to do is wait until they've played out enough line
704000	706000	and then reel it in.
706000	708000	Ignoring evidence is one thing,
708000	711000	but when a citizen scientist changes the evidence,
711000	714000	then you need to compare his claim to the primary source.
714000	720000	Honestly, I don't trust radiometric and carbon dating at all,
720000	722000	but bear with me here.
722000	725000	Here's a little article from an article.
725000	727000	As with facts and evidence,
727000	730000	the citizen scientist will often be evasive and obtuse
730000	732000	when asked for a source.
732000	734000	For example, data is not a source.
734000	736000	I could claim the Sun orbits the Earth
736000	739000	and cite astronomical data as my source.
739000	740000	It's meaningless.
740000	744000	As Z. Shogan did here, ask for the title or author of a paper
744000	747000	that reached this conclusion based on that data.
747000	749000	You'll usually find there is none.
749000	751000	Neil Adams, the comic book illustrator
751000	753000	who thinks the Earth is expanding,
753000	756000	gives his source for a claim as geology textbooks.
756000	759000	Doesn't say which ones or which page number,
759000	762000	which is just one step up from the other common answer,
762000	765000	everyone knows it, or look it up.
765000	767000	For a source to be meaningful,
767000	769000	it has to be something you can check,
769000	771000	which of course is why the citizen scientists
771000	773000	don't like to give it.
773000	776000	As soon as they do give a source, their argument falls flat.
776000	780000	A living mollusk shell carbon dated at 2300 years old.
780000	782000	Well, here we are 14 years later,
782000	783000	carbon dating is still not working.
783000	785000	Here's our old friend Kent Hovind
785000	787000	trying to show that carbon dating doesn't work
787000	789000	because he claims living mollusks
789000	793000	were carbon dated at 2300 years old.
793000	796000	Unfortunately for Hovind, he gives us a source,
796000	799000	a scientific paper by Keith and Anderson.
799000	801000	That may impress other citizen scientists
801000	803000	who get all their information off the internet,
803000	807000	but for people who fact check, this is so easy to debunk.
807000	810000	As even the title of the paper suggests,
810000	812000	Keith and Anderson weren't trying to carbon date
812000	813000	a living mollusk at all.
813000	815000	They were carbon dating its shell,
815000	817000	and since the carbon in the shell
817000	820000	came from very old calcium carbonate in the water,
820000	822000	it gave a very old date.
822000	824000	The purpose of the paper was to show
824000	827000	that you can't derive the age of an aquatic animal
827000	829000	by carbon dating.
829000	831000	So what do you do when the citizen scientist
831000	833000	flat out refuses to give a source?
833000	837000	The usual excuse is, I won't engage in a site war.
837000	840000	Well, I have a few solutions.
840000	842000	First, try googling the claim verbatim
842000	845000	because citizen scientists often can't or won't
845000	847000	write their arguments in their own words.
847000	849000	They'll just copy and paste it.
849000	851000	You'll soon find out where it came from.
851000	853000	When a date differs from that expected,
853000	855000	researchers readily invent excuses
855000	857000	for rejecting the result.
857000	859000	The common application of such posterior reasoning
859000	861000	shows that radiometric dating...
861000	862000	And thanks to Google images,
862000	864000	it's also possible to trace the source
864000	866000	of faked photos as well.
866000	869000	This one, which Jesse Ventura's conspiracy show
869000	871000	claimed was taken in the northern hemisphere
871000	873000	just before the Boxing Day tsunami...
873000	875000	This photo was actually taken just before
875000	877000	the big tsunami hit the coast of Indonesia.
877000	880000	...turned out to be a poster photo taken in Australia.
880000	882000	You can buy it off the internet.
883000	889000	Here's a technique I tried when a YouTuber
889000	892000	called Laurel Bush refused to give up her source.
892000	894000	She messaged me with a familiar internet story
894000	896000	that Vikings had been found buried
896000	898000	in permafrost in Greenland.
898000	901000	After several fruitless attempts at getting a source,
901000	903000	she told me of course to look it up,
903000	906000	I simply pretended I'd found it on my own.
906000	908000	I invented a scientific paper
908000	910000	from the University of Copenhagen,
910000	912000	and I said that according to the paper,
912000	913000	the bodies were skeletons,
913000	915000	meaning they must have decomposed
915000	917000	and couldn't have been buried in permafrost.
917000	919000	All bullshit, of course,
919000	921000	but it had the desired effect.
921000	924000	About to be gazumped by this twaddle,
924000	926000	Laurel Bush immediately came back
926000	928000	with a quote to show I was wrong,
928000	931000	and bingo, I googled the text she gave me
931000	932000	and found her source.
932000	934000	Now you'll notice that I'm lumping
934000	937000	all these various junk science beliefs together,
937000	939000	even though I often get emails from people
939000	942000	who tell me they accept the theory of evolution,
942000	946000	but not the theory of plate tectonics or climate change.
946000	948000	That's like telling me you believe
948000	950000	witches fly on broomsticks,
950000	952000	but you're not gullible enough to believe
952000	954000	that tooth fairies leave money under pillows.
954000	957000	It's hardly something to be proud of.
957000	959000	Science isn't a pick and mix
959000	962000	based on your religious or ideological beliefs.
962000	964000	But the reason I lump you all together
964000	966000	for the purpose of this video
966000	968000	is that your approach in arguing your case
968000	970000	is exactly the same,
970000	973000	no matter what scientific theory you don't like.
973000	975000	Cherry-pick or distort the evidence
975000	978000	to fit the conclusion you've already reached.
978000	980000	Get your science information from blogs
980000	982000	that share your beliefs and never check them.
982000	984000	Find a couple of experts who disagree
984000	986000	with the majority of researchers
986000	988000	and quote them endlessly
988000	991000	to give the impression the scientific community is divided.
991000	994000	Or get someone with doctor or professor
994000	997000	in front of his name and pretend he's an expert,
997000	999000	even if he's never published anything
999000	1002000	in his supposed field of expertise.
1002000	1005000	Say that all you want is for both sides to be heard.
1005000	1008000	Draw up a petition of scientists who support your case,
1008000	1011000	even if they have no qualifications in the relevant field.
1011000	1014000	How to explain the fact that few scientific papers
1014000	1017000	support your case? Claim censorship.
1017000	1020000	And why don't most scientists support your theories?
1020000	1024000	Because, of course, they're all either dishonest or incompetent.
1024000	1028000	Never entertain the possibility that they know something you don't.
1028000	1031000	Now, I'm sure all the citizen scientists out there will say,
1031000	1034000	well, we can do exactly the same thing, pot-holer.
1034000	1037000	We can ask questions, too, and stump all you science nerds.
1037000	1039000	But it doesn't work that way,
1039000	1041000	because those who accept science
1041000	1043000	aren't coming up with wacky theories of their own
1043000	1045000	that they have to defend.
1045000	1048000	We're simply quoting what's in the scientific literature.
1048000	1050000	Now, you might be able to show
1050000	1052000	that we've erroneously misquoted the science.
1052000	1054000	That's happened to me quite a few times.
1054000	1057000	And then all we have to do is admit that we got it wrong
1057000	1059000	and correct the error. It's that easy.
1059000	1063000	In fact, I wish citizen scientists would ask more questions
1063000	1065000	because then they'd be able to get some answers
1065000	1068000	which they won't find in the places they usually go
1068000	1070000	for information on science.
1070000	1072000	In fact, most of the questions I've seen
1072000	1075000	are incredibly easy to respond to.
1075000	1078000	When I googled questions evolutionists can't answer,
1078000	1081000	I found these question evolution questions,
1081000	1083000	which have even been made into a T-shirt,
1083000	1085000	and a host of other lists.
1085000	1087000	I won't have time to go through all these questions,
1087000	1090000	but you'll find the answers in the video description.
1090000	1093000	When I googled questions warmists can't answer,
1093000	1095000	I found these two.
1095000	1097000	And these rather innocuous questions prompted
1097000	1100000	a few more questions on a discussion forum,
1100000	1103000	also answered in the video description.
1103000	1106000	But if you don't know the answers, don't worry.
1106000	1109000	Remember, you don't have to pretend to be an expert.
1109000	1112000	You simply have to quote what real scientists say.
1112000	1115000	If you don't know, then say you don't know.
1115000	1118000	It's sometimes interesting to then ask the citizen scientist,
1118000	1121000	well, what do the scientists say?
1121000	1123000	He can never admit he doesn't know,
1123000	1127000	so listen to whatever answer he makes up and ask for a source.
1127000	1129000	Despite all this, a lot of people probably still think
1129000	1132000	that citizen scientists sound persuasive.
1132000	1135000	After all, why shouldn't their beliefs be just as valid
1135000	1137000	as the conclusions of real scientists?
1137000	1139000	And why can't their web pages be just as legitimate
1139000	1141000	as peer-reviewed papers published in
1141000	1143000	respected scientific journals?
1143000	1146000	Well, let me just ask one final question.
1146000	1149000	If you're happy to get your science from a citizen scientist,
1149000	1152000	then would you be just as happy to have a root canal
1152000	1155000	performed by a citizen dentist?
