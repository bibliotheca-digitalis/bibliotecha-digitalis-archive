00:00.000 --> 00:04.640
While I was writing my last video, I collected a bit of information about former President

00:04.640 --> 00:10.480
Obama's house on the coast, because I was having an online discussion with someone.

00:10.480 --> 00:14.460
In the end I decided it's not really worth debunking, because it didn't have much to

00:14.460 --> 00:20.100
do with science. But then it was brought up as an argument in several posts responding

00:20.100 --> 00:26.280
to that video, not just Obama buying coastal property, but also Al Gore, Nancy Pelosi and

00:26.280 --> 00:31.980
Bill Gates. And it turns out this is also a big talking point on the blogosphere.

00:31.980 --> 00:37.660
So I'll treat this as a legitimate question. If sea levels are rising, why are people who

00:37.660 --> 00:42.880
accept the conclusions of oceanographers and climate scientists still buying beachfront

00:42.880 --> 00:48.080
property? Isn't it all going to be underwater? asked one poster.

00:48.080 --> 00:53.460
We'll start with Obama, and this question from a guest blog on WhatsUpWithThat.

00:53.460 --> 00:58.260
Did Obama just buy a beachfront mansion? Rumours are flying that the owner of a beachfront

00:58.260 --> 01:03.720
mansion in Hawaii is none other than President Obama, the same President who warns us that

01:03.720 --> 01:09.000
global warming and rising sea levels are a greater danger to the future of America than

01:09.000 --> 01:15.600
Islamic terrorism. I can now confirm that this story was in fact true. There were rumours

01:15.600 --> 01:21.100
flying that Obama had bought a beachfront mansion in Hawaii. Unfortunately the rumours

01:21.100 --> 01:26.520
turned out to be false. The property had been bought by the head of the Obama Foundation,

01:26.520 --> 01:32.520
Marty Nesbitt. But that didn't prevent the rumours from being upgraded to actual fact.

01:32.520 --> 01:37.720
However, while the Obamas didn't buy this oceanfront property, they did buy another

01:37.720 --> 01:44.000
oceanfront property at Martha's Vineyard, so attention was switched to that. The WhatsUpWithThat

01:44.000 --> 01:49.200
blog tried again. Sea level rise? Obama just bought a beachside

01:49.200 --> 01:56.860
property. Well, not quite. The property is at 79 Turkiland Cove Road in Edgartown, Massachusetts,

01:56.860 --> 02:02.340
which is several hundred metres from the beach and about ten feet above sea level. So if

02:02.340 --> 02:07.620
President Obama really does follow the science, as he professes to do, then he knows that

02:07.620 --> 02:11.940
storm surges aren't going to be an issue, and he knows that even at the extreme high

02:11.940 --> 02:17.500
end of estimates, scientific projections show that the property will be permanently inundated

02:17.520 --> 02:24.200
sometime after the year 2200. That's 180 years from now, by which time Barack and Michelle

02:24.200 --> 02:31.200
will be about 250 years old, and not that bothered. Al Gore also came in for some flak

02:31.200 --> 02:36.560
after buying this house right on the beach. Just a couple to three years after the Nobel

02:36.560 --> 02:43.000
Peace Prize, he and Tipper, well tragically before their divorce, they went out and spent

02:43.000 --> 02:48.380
$9 million on a mansion on the oceanfront in California.

02:48.380 --> 02:54.020
One blogger wrote, Mr Gore just paid nearly $9 million for the property, which according

02:54.020 --> 03:00.220
to his professed beliefs, will likely soon be literally underwater and hence worthless

03:00.220 --> 03:05.940
both as a residence and for resale. The blogger rules out the possibility that Al Gore is

03:05.940 --> 03:11.480
so dumb he'll buy a house he believes will be underwater likely soon, so that leaves

03:11.480 --> 03:17.620
only one possibility, he says, that Mr Gore is a self-conscious, witting liar who doesn't

03:17.620 --> 03:22.820
actually believe his predictions of doom. Of course, Al Gore may be a self-conscious,

03:22.820 --> 03:27.660
witting liar who doesn't actually believe his predictions of doom, who knows? But there

03:27.660 --> 03:33.300
is a very obvious third possibility, which is, way ahead of me, that his house is in

03:33.300 --> 03:40.340
no danger from rising sea levels at all. For a start, this isn't his house. Al Gore's

03:40.340 --> 03:46.880
house is at 1504 East Mountain Drive, Montecito, in the hills overlooking the town, and about

03:46.880 --> 03:52.880
50 feet above sea level. So according to the scientific projections Al Gore professes to

03:52.880 --> 03:59.320
believe his house should be underwater several hundred years after he's dead. I don't have

03:59.320 --> 04:04.400
an exact address for John Kerry's house, but it doesn't matter. Most of Chilmark, where

04:04.400 --> 04:10.000
he bought his house, is also comfortably more than 10 feet above sea level.

04:10.000 --> 04:15.260
So let's try Nancy Pelosi's house. According to an anonymous tweet, and if you can't trust

04:15.260 --> 04:21.240
anonymous tweets on the internet, who can you trust, Nancy bought this house. Clearly

04:21.240 --> 04:27.520
it's right on the water. But sadly, it doesn't seem to belong to Nancy Pelosi. Her office

04:27.520 --> 04:33.260
and the real estate agency selling the house said she isn't the buyer. So unless someone

04:33.260 --> 04:38.500
has evidence other than a tweet, that claim is a non-starter.

04:38.500 --> 04:44.880
The strongest contender is a beach house owned by Bill Gates at 2808 Oceanfront, Delmar,

04:44.880 --> 04:50.440
California. It's not his main residence, but it is only a few feet above sea level and

04:50.440 --> 04:56.440
right next to the beach. So Bill has only another hundred years or so to enjoy his beach

04:56.440 --> 05:02.800
house, then at the age of 160 he'll either have to buy another one or spend more time

05:02.800 --> 05:08.420
in his main residence, or one of the dozen other mansions he owns. The more immediate

05:08.420 --> 05:13.520
problem for Bill is that long before the beach house gets inundated, he'll have to protect

05:13.520 --> 05:19.420
it against storm surges and coastal erosion. The engineering work doesn't come cheap, maybe

05:19.420 --> 05:23.940
upwards of a million dollars. So I hope he's got a bit of cash.

05:23.940 --> 05:28.820
In sum, according to the scientific projections, these wealthy people don't have much to worry

05:28.820 --> 05:34.660
about regardless of their political affiliation or beliefs. There's no scientific evidence

05:34.660 --> 05:39.500
that sea levels will rise by several feet in the next few years, and as far as I know,

05:39.500 --> 05:44.460
none of them has made that claim. Certainly there's no such claim made in the scientific

05:44.460 --> 05:47.860
literature. If you really believe that sea level rise is

05:47.860 --> 05:54.020
a problem, I will guarantee to buy that property for one dollar, because after all it's not

05:54.020 --> 05:57.860
worth anything to you. Well, what a surprise. No one wants to sell

05:57.900 --> 06:02.580
a house which will be snapped up on the market for millions of dollars for just a dollar.

06:02.580 --> 06:08.540
I wonder why. Once again, not a great argument against the science.

06:08.540 --> 06:12.780
In the end, it makes no difference to the science whether Al Gore and Barack Obama are

06:12.780 --> 06:18.380
wonderful people or the most disgusting creatures on earth. Scientific facts are scientific

06:18.380 --> 06:23.780
facts regardless. And the fact that their houses are safely out of harm's way doesn't

06:23.780 --> 06:28.820
matter either. There are much more immediate problems to concern ourselves with than Al

06:28.820 --> 06:33.220
Gore's basement getting flooded a thousand years from now.

06:33.220 --> 06:37.620
So let's have a look at the more interesting question of why people buy beachfront properties

06:37.620 --> 06:42.460
that really are vulnerable. If it's so close to disaster, why is it that

06:42.460 --> 06:47.660
oceanfront mansions are selling better than ever? Record prices, record numbers.

06:47.660 --> 06:51.960
That's a very good question. And not just for property with a limited lifetime due to

06:51.960 --> 06:57.760
sea level rise, but also associated problems like subsidence, shifting sands and coastal

06:57.760 --> 07:01.680
erosion. Even in Miami, where many of the scientists

07:01.680 --> 07:06.560
say it's going to hit first and be worse there. Actually, I've heard that it's already happening.

07:06.560 --> 07:11.720
That's right, it is. Some buyers are now taking height above sea level into consideration,

07:11.720 --> 07:16.320
along with square footage and proximity to schools and stores when buying a house in

07:16.320 --> 07:22.160
South Florida. And so are mortgage lenders and insurance companies. And that is having

07:22.160 --> 07:29.560
some effect on property prices. But that's only some buyers. What about the rest?

07:29.560 --> 07:34.840
This map of property prices shows that the most expensive areas, the darker green colours,

07:34.840 --> 07:40.040
are along the coast. Why? Well, obviously one reason is that living

07:40.040 --> 07:46.240
or retiring near the beach is a popular dream. So buyers over 40 aren't going to worry about

07:46.240 --> 07:51.080
what will happen to their property due to rising sea levels in 50 years' time. By then

07:51.080 --> 07:57.800
they'll be too old or too dead to care. And since only 73% of Americans believe the science

07:57.800 --> 08:02.640
anyway, the rest will be quite happy to buy coastal property, whatever the projections

08:02.640 --> 08:06.320
are. The buyers we need to look at are those who

08:06.320 --> 08:12.160
do accept the science and plan to sell their properties in 20 or 30 years, or pass them

08:12.160 --> 08:18.560
on to their offspring. They have a calculation to make. They know that in 100 years, scientific

08:18.560 --> 08:24.280
projections show that the sea may be permanently covering the floor of a $400,000 house they

08:24.280 --> 08:31.480
want to buy. So they know that somewhere between their house being worth $400,000 now and nothing

08:31.480 --> 08:37.840
100 years from now, prices will have to stop rising at some point and start to fall. The

08:37.840 --> 08:42.860
problem is that they don't know when that transition point will be. If they manage to

08:42.860 --> 08:48.280
sell before the decline begins, then they get to enjoy the beach lifestyle they want

08:48.280 --> 08:54.320
for a limited time and then sell at a healthy profit. But if they don't, then they risk

08:54.320 --> 08:59.160
being left holding a property few people want to buy in a falling market. There were some

08:59.160 --> 09:05.320
interesting experiments conducted along these lines by economist Vernon Smith in the 1980s

09:05.320 --> 09:11.320
which showed this very starkly. Test subjects were given some money and told to trade imaginary

09:11.320 --> 09:17.320
shares. They were told the real value of each share would start at $3.60 and decline over

09:17.320 --> 09:24.680
time. So at the end of the game, any shares they had left would be worth just $0.24. As

09:24.680 --> 09:29.080
an incentive to try as hard as they could to make a profit, they were allowed to keep

09:29.080 --> 09:33.780
whatever profit they made at the end of the experiment.

09:33.780 --> 09:38.340
To begin with, the shares were offered to them at a lower price than their actual value,

09:38.340 --> 09:45.060
usually around $2 a share, just like a real IPO, and then they started trading. Obviously

09:45.060 --> 09:50.060
since the test subjects knew the shares were worth more than the $2 trading price, they

09:50.060 --> 09:56.160
started buying shares, and the trading price therefore moved upwards. Now you would have

09:56.160 --> 10:00.600
thought that when the trading price met the actual value of the shares, people would want

10:00.600 --> 10:05.800
to cash in and sell. After all, they knew that from that point onwards, the value of

10:05.800 --> 10:11.520
their shares would decline. But they didn't. They kept on buying, and so the trading price

10:11.520 --> 10:17.540
kept going up. It seemed that regardless of fundamental value, the more prices went up,

10:17.540 --> 10:22.360
the more people wanted to buy, and the more they wanted to buy, the more the prices went

10:22.360 --> 10:27.620
up. Halfway through, they were trading shares way above their actual value, and they were

10:27.640 --> 10:33.060
getting closer to the end of the game where the shares would be almost worthless. It was

10:33.060 --> 10:37.940
only when some traders lost their nerve and decided to cash in their profits that the

10:37.940 --> 10:42.900
price curve flattened out. When others saw that prices were no longer going up, there

10:42.900 --> 10:49.300
was a scramble to get out of the market. The result was a classic asset bubble, and Vernon

10:49.300 --> 10:54.960
Smith got the same bubble with different groups of people, even experienced market traders.

10:54.960 --> 11:01.960
Think about the housing bubble. Buyers, sellers, borrowers, lenders, real estate agents, government

11:03.680 --> 11:10.680
regulators, everybody believed that prices would rise and continue to rise. And that

11:12.120 --> 11:18.880
is kind of the essence of one of these, of a bubble. So substitute property prices for

11:18.880 --> 11:24.860
share prices, and we come back to the same puzzling question. Why don't buyers recognize

11:24.860 --> 11:31.300
the long-term reality? I don't have a Nobel Prize in economics, like Vernon Smith, so

11:31.300 --> 11:36.420
I'll let him give the answer, when he was asked the same question during an interview.

11:36.420 --> 11:39.180
They don't recognize that the value is declining or they don't care.

11:39.180 --> 11:46.180
Well, let me just say, right now, that we don't understand why it is that people get

11:46.540 --> 11:52.860
caught up in self-reinforcing expectations of rising prices.

11:52.860 --> 11:58.300
So there it is. We can understand the physics of why sea levels are rising, and we can measure

11:58.300 --> 12:05.300
that rise, but we still don't understand why humans make irrational economic decisions.

12:05.320 --> 12:09.620
Of course, there'll be a thousand Nobel Prize candidates in the comments forum with a thousand

12:09.620 --> 12:15.120
different theories explaining it, and they'll all be right. But whatever the reason, it's

12:15.120 --> 12:20.300
not a good idea to bet that because people make irrational or emotional decisions in

12:20.300 --> 12:23.860
the marketplace, then science must be wrong.

12:23.860 --> 12:29.420
A hundred years before the sea covers low-lying parts of South Florida may seem like a long

12:29.420 --> 12:36.340
time, but long before we get permanent inundation, the storm surges and king tides that occasionally

12:36.340 --> 12:42.480
flood the region will become more regular and more destructive. So anyone planning to

12:42.480 --> 12:47.860
sell a house 25 years from now, the life of a typical mortgage, will be trying to sell

12:47.860 --> 12:53.620
to people who know that saltwater will likely be invading their home dozens of times during

12:53.620 --> 13:00.020
the lifetime of their own mortgage. And the banks and insurance companies know that too.

13:00.020 --> 13:04.940
So more and more people are going to do what some forward-thinking buyers are already doing

13:04.940 --> 13:10.900
– weigh height above sea level into the value of the house and pay accordingly. And

13:10.900 --> 13:16.900
that point of hesitancy is the point at which the bubble starts to burst.

13:16.940 --> 13:23.000
Of course, you can say, that's no big deal, people will just move. And that's true.

13:23.000 --> 13:27.460
The economy can probably absorb the collapse of the vulnerable part of the Florida real

13:27.460 --> 13:34.460
estate market, which is worth about $8.7 trillion. But the problem is a lot bigger than a few

13:34.460 --> 13:39.680
million residential homes in suburban Florida. For a start, there's the infrastructure

13:39.680 --> 13:45.260
in coastal cities all over the world, which is a lot more expensive and a lot harder to

13:45.260 --> 13:51.500
move. On top of that, there are more immediate problems associated with climate change, such

13:51.500 --> 13:58.220
as water shortages for billions of people as glaciers disappear, or wildfires, salination,

13:58.220 --> 14:03.780
disappearing coral reefs and fisheries, droughts and floods. If you think mitigating these

14:03.780 --> 14:08.900
problems involves some kind of world communist government, take a look at the video where

14:08.900 --> 14:13.980
I show what's being done to shift from fossil fuel energy to clean energy under the Free

14:13.980 --> 14:18.740
Enterprise system, you might be surprised.

14:18.740 --> 14:23.680
Before I go, I have to apologise to all those who say their posts aren't showing up or

14:23.680 --> 14:28.980
disappearing from the channel. Inevitably, there are accusations that I'm censoring

14:28.980 --> 14:33.800
criticism, which is clearly nonsense as you can see by reading through the hundreds of

14:33.800 --> 14:39.440
critical comments on my channel. What's happening is that YouTube is automatically

14:39.440 --> 14:45.040
sending a lot of posts directly to spam, both critical and supportive, for reasons

14:45.040 --> 14:50.880
that I can't fathom. Here are some of them in the spam folder, see what you can find

14:50.880 --> 14:56.400
wrong with those. Consequently, I have to clear out the spam folder every now and again,

14:56.400 --> 15:01.880
but it takes a long time and it's a pretty thankless task. So if your post doesn't

15:01.880 --> 15:06.520
show up, it's a good idea to make a copy of your comment before you post it, and if

15:06.520 --> 15:12.560
it doesn't show up, try again, or complain to YouTube. If your post is a violation of

15:12.560 --> 15:18.560
my channel rules against advertising, racism and plagiarism, then let me know why you think

15:18.560 --> 15:23.880
those rules are unfair. And on another issue, I've been successful

15:23.880 --> 15:29.260
in getting this channel monetised, but I was unsuccessful in getting it monetised for the

15:29.260 --> 15:34.800
benefit of the charity that I support, Health in Harmony. YouTube doesn't allow the content

15:34.800 --> 15:41.480
creator to be in one country and the beneficiary in another. I could of course allow advertisements,

15:41.480 --> 15:46.560
name myself as the beneficiary and pass the money on, but that leaves me open to claims

15:46.560 --> 15:51.300
that I've monetised this channel for my own benefit. A number of people have tried

15:51.300 --> 15:57.040
to claim that I'm making these videos for financial gain or deliberately making clickbait,

15:57.040 --> 16:01.600
and as long as the channel isn't monetised for my own benefit, those claims are pretty

16:01.600 --> 16:07.240
easily rebuffed. So rather than lay myself open to charges of profiting, I'd rather

16:07.240 --> 16:12.360
continue to make these videos for free and ask that people donate to the charity listed

16:12.360 --> 16:17.820
in the video description. Knowing that I'm helping them do important work in saving lives

16:17.820 --> 16:24.080
and protecting forests is what keeps me going. The only exception is going to be the occasional

16:24.080 --> 16:30.000
educational video, so out of the hundreds of videos I've made, I have monetised one.

16:30.000 --> 16:35.600
This one. And I'm planning to make another on how mountains are formed, and I'll monetise

16:35.600 --> 16:40.880
that one too. Everything else is free. So thanks to those who've contributed to the

16:40.880 --> 16:47.540
charity, raising around $200,000, and I hope you'll continue to be generous as you watch

16:47.540 --> 16:48.360
more videos.
