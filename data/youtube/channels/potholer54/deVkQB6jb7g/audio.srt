1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,640
While I was writing my last video, I collected a bit of information about former President

2
00:00:04,640 --> 00:00:10,480
Obama's house on the coast, because I was having an online discussion with someone.

3
00:00:10,480 --> 00:00:14,460
In the end I decided it's not really worth debunking, because it didn't have much to

4
00:00:14,460 --> 00:00:20,100
do with science. But then it was brought up as an argument in several posts responding

5
00:00:20,100 --> 00:00:26,280
to that video, not just Obama buying coastal property, but also Al Gore, Nancy Pelosi and

6
00:00:26,280 --> 00:00:31,980
Bill Gates. And it turns out this is also a big talking point on the blogosphere.

7
00:00:31,980 --> 00:00:37,660
So I'll treat this as a legitimate question. If sea levels are rising, why are people who

8
00:00:37,660 --> 00:00:42,880
accept the conclusions of oceanographers and climate scientists still buying beachfront

9
00:00:42,880 --> 00:00:48,080
property? Isn't it all going to be underwater? asked one poster.

10
00:00:48,080 --> 00:00:53,460
We'll start with Obama, and this question from a guest blog on WhatsUpWithThat.

11
00:00:53,460 --> 00:00:58,260
Did Obama just buy a beachfront mansion? Rumours are flying that the owner of a beachfront

12
00:00:58,260 --> 00:01:03,720
mansion in Hawaii is none other than President Obama, the same President who warns us that

13
00:01:03,720 --> 00:01:09,000
global warming and rising sea levels are a greater danger to the future of America than

14
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:15,600
Islamic terrorism. I can now confirm that this story was in fact true. There were rumours

15
00:01:15,600 --> 00:01:21,100
flying that Obama had bought a beachfront mansion in Hawaii. Unfortunately the rumours

16
00:01:21,100 --> 00:01:26,520
turned out to be false. The property had been bought by the head of the Obama Foundation,

17
00:01:26,520 --> 00:01:32,520
Marty Nesbitt. But that didn't prevent the rumours from being upgraded to actual fact.

18
00:01:32,520 --> 00:01:37,720
However, while the Obamas didn't buy this oceanfront property, they did buy another

19
00:01:37,720 --> 00:01:44,000
oceanfront property at Martha's Vineyard, so attention was switched to that. The WhatsUpWithThat

20
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:49,200
blog tried again. Sea level rise? Obama just bought a beachside

21
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:56,860
property. Well, not quite. The property is at 79 Turkiland Cove Road in Edgartown, Massachusetts,

22
00:01:56,860 --> 00:02:02,340
which is several hundred metres from the beach and about ten feet above sea level. So if

23
00:02:02,340 --> 00:02:07,620
President Obama really does follow the science, as he professes to do, then he knows that

24
00:02:07,620 --> 00:02:11,940
storm surges aren't going to be an issue, and he knows that even at the extreme high

25
00:02:11,940 --> 00:02:17,500
end of estimates, scientific projections show that the property will be permanently inundated

26
00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:24,200
sometime after the year 2200. That's 180 years from now, by which time Barack and Michelle

27
00:02:24,200 --> 00:02:31,200
will be about 250 years old, and not that bothered. Al Gore also came in for some flak

28
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:36,560
after buying this house right on the beach. Just a couple to three years after the Nobel

29
00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:43,000
Peace Prize, he and Tipper, well tragically before their divorce, they went out and spent

30
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:48,380
$9 million on a mansion on the oceanfront in California.

31
00:02:48,380 --> 00:02:54,020
One blogger wrote, Mr Gore just paid nearly $9 million for the property, which according

32
00:02:54,020 --> 00:03:00,220
to his professed beliefs, will likely soon be literally underwater and hence worthless

33
00:03:00,220 --> 00:03:05,940
both as a residence and for resale. The blogger rules out the possibility that Al Gore is

34
00:03:05,940 --> 00:03:11,480
so dumb he'll buy a house he believes will be underwater likely soon, so that leaves

35
00:03:11,480 --> 00:03:17,620
only one possibility, he says, that Mr Gore is a self-conscious, witting liar who doesn't

36
00:03:17,620 --> 00:03:22,820
actually believe his predictions of doom. Of course, Al Gore may be a self-conscious,

37
00:03:22,820 --> 00:03:27,660
witting liar who doesn't actually believe his predictions of doom, who knows? But there

38
00:03:27,660 --> 00:03:33,300
is a very obvious third possibility, which is, way ahead of me, that his house is in

39
00:03:33,300 --> 00:03:40,340
no danger from rising sea levels at all. For a start, this isn't his house. Al Gore's

40
00:03:40,340 --> 00:03:46,880
house is at 1504 East Mountain Drive, Montecito, in the hills overlooking the town, and about

41
00:03:46,880 --> 00:03:52,880
50 feet above sea level. So according to the scientific projections Al Gore professes to

42
00:03:52,880 --> 00:03:59,320
believe his house should be underwater several hundred years after he's dead. I don't have

43
00:03:59,320 --> 00:04:04,400
an exact address for John Kerry's house, but it doesn't matter. Most of Chilmark, where

44
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:10,000
he bought his house, is also comfortably more than 10 feet above sea level.

45
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:15,260
So let's try Nancy Pelosi's house. According to an anonymous tweet, and if you can't trust

46
00:04:15,260 --> 00:04:21,240
anonymous tweets on the internet, who can you trust, Nancy bought this house. Clearly

47
00:04:21,240 --> 00:04:27,520
it's right on the water. But sadly, it doesn't seem to belong to Nancy Pelosi. Her office

48
00:04:27,520 --> 00:04:33,260
and the real estate agency selling the house said she isn't the buyer. So unless someone

49
00:04:33,260 --> 00:04:38,500
has evidence other than a tweet, that claim is a non-starter.

50
00:04:38,500 --> 00:04:44,880
The strongest contender is a beach house owned by Bill Gates at 2808 Oceanfront, Delmar,

51
00:04:44,880 --> 00:04:50,440
California. It's not his main residence, but it is only a few feet above sea level and

52
00:04:50,440 --> 00:04:56,440
right next to the beach. So Bill has only another hundred years or so to enjoy his beach

53
00:04:56,440 --> 00:05:02,800
house, then at the age of 160 he'll either have to buy another one or spend more time

54
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:08,420
in his main residence, or one of the dozen other mansions he owns. The more immediate

55
00:05:08,420 --> 00:05:13,520
problem for Bill is that long before the beach house gets inundated, he'll have to protect

56
00:05:13,520 --> 00:05:19,420
it against storm surges and coastal erosion. The engineering work doesn't come cheap, maybe

57
00:05:19,420 --> 00:05:23,940
upwards of a million dollars. So I hope he's got a bit of cash.

58
00:05:23,940 --> 00:05:28,820
In sum, according to the scientific projections, these wealthy people don't have much to worry

59
00:05:28,820 --> 00:05:34,660
about regardless of their political affiliation or beliefs. There's no scientific evidence

60
00:05:34,660 --> 00:05:39,500
that sea levels will rise by several feet in the next few years, and as far as I know,

61
00:05:39,500 --> 00:05:44,460
none of them has made that claim. Certainly there's no such claim made in the scientific

62
00:05:44,460 --> 00:05:47,860
literature. If you really believe that sea level rise is

63
00:05:47,860 --> 00:05:54,020
a problem, I will guarantee to buy that property for one dollar, because after all it's not

64
00:05:54,020 --> 00:05:57,860
worth anything to you. Well, what a surprise. No one wants to sell

65
00:05:57,900 --> 00:06:02,580
a house which will be snapped up on the market for millions of dollars for just a dollar.

66
00:06:02,580 --> 00:06:08,540
I wonder why. Once again, not a great argument against the science.

67
00:06:08,540 --> 00:06:12,780
In the end, it makes no difference to the science whether Al Gore and Barack Obama are

68
00:06:12,780 --> 00:06:18,380
wonderful people or the most disgusting creatures on earth. Scientific facts are scientific

69
00:06:18,380 --> 00:06:23,780
facts regardless. And the fact that their houses are safely out of harm's way doesn't

70
00:06:23,780 --> 00:06:28,820
matter either. There are much more immediate problems to concern ourselves with than Al

71
00:06:28,820 --> 00:06:33,220
Gore's basement getting flooded a thousand years from now.

72
00:06:33,220 --> 00:06:37,620
So let's have a look at the more interesting question of why people buy beachfront properties

73
00:06:37,620 --> 00:06:42,460
that really are vulnerable. If it's so close to disaster, why is it that

74
00:06:42,460 --> 00:06:47,660
oceanfront mansions are selling better than ever? Record prices, record numbers.

75
00:06:47,660 --> 00:06:51,960
That's a very good question. And not just for property with a limited lifetime due to

76
00:06:51,960 --> 00:06:57,760
sea level rise, but also associated problems like subsidence, shifting sands and coastal

77
00:06:57,760 --> 00:07:01,680
erosion. Even in Miami, where many of the scientists

78
00:07:01,680 --> 00:07:06,560
say it's going to hit first and be worse there. Actually, I've heard that it's already happening.

79
00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:11,720
That's right, it is. Some buyers are now taking height above sea level into consideration,

80
00:07:11,720 --> 00:07:16,320
along with square footage and proximity to schools and stores when buying a house in

81
00:07:16,320 --> 00:07:22,160
South Florida. And so are mortgage lenders and insurance companies. And that is having

82
00:07:22,160 --> 00:07:29,560
some effect on property prices. But that's only some buyers. What about the rest?

83
00:07:29,560 --> 00:07:34,840
This map of property prices shows that the most expensive areas, the darker green colours,

84
00:07:34,840 --> 00:07:40,040
are along the coast. Why? Well, obviously one reason is that living

85
00:07:40,040 --> 00:07:46,240
or retiring near the beach is a popular dream. So buyers over 40 aren't going to worry about

86
00:07:46,240 --> 00:07:51,080
what will happen to their property due to rising sea levels in 50 years' time. By then

87
00:07:51,080 --> 00:07:57,800
they'll be too old or too dead to care. And since only 73% of Americans believe the science

88
00:07:57,800 --> 00:08:02,640
anyway, the rest will be quite happy to buy coastal property, whatever the projections

89
00:08:02,640 --> 00:08:06,320
are. The buyers we need to look at are those who

90
00:08:06,320 --> 00:08:12,160
do accept the science and plan to sell their properties in 20 or 30 years, or pass them

91
00:08:12,160 --> 00:08:18,560
on to their offspring. They have a calculation to make. They know that in 100 years, scientific

92
00:08:18,560 --> 00:08:24,280
projections show that the sea may be permanently covering the floor of a $400,000 house they

93
00:08:24,280 --> 00:08:31,480
want to buy. So they know that somewhere between their house being worth $400,000 now and nothing

94
00:08:31,480 --> 00:08:37,840
100 years from now, prices will have to stop rising at some point and start to fall. The

95
00:08:37,840 --> 00:08:42,860
problem is that they don't know when that transition point will be. If they manage to

96
00:08:42,860 --> 00:08:48,280
sell before the decline begins, then they get to enjoy the beach lifestyle they want

97
00:08:48,280 --> 00:08:54,320
for a limited time and then sell at a healthy profit. But if they don't, then they risk

98
00:08:54,320 --> 00:08:59,160
being left holding a property few people want to buy in a falling market. There were some

99
00:08:59,160 --> 00:09:05,320
interesting experiments conducted along these lines by economist Vernon Smith in the 1980s

100
00:09:05,320 --> 00:09:11,320
which showed this very starkly. Test subjects were given some money and told to trade imaginary

101
00:09:11,320 --> 00:09:17,320
shares. They were told the real value of each share would start at $3.60 and decline over

102
00:09:17,320 --> 00:09:24,680
time. So at the end of the game, any shares they had left would be worth just $0.24. As

103
00:09:24,680 --> 00:09:29,080
an incentive to try as hard as they could to make a profit, they were allowed to keep

104
00:09:29,080 --> 00:09:33,780
whatever profit they made at the end of the experiment.

105
00:09:33,780 --> 00:09:38,340
To begin with, the shares were offered to them at a lower price than their actual value,

106
00:09:38,340 --> 00:09:45,060
usually around $2 a share, just like a real IPO, and then they started trading. Obviously

107
00:09:45,060 --> 00:09:50,060
since the test subjects knew the shares were worth more than the $2 trading price, they

108
00:09:50,060 --> 00:09:56,160
started buying shares, and the trading price therefore moved upwards. Now you would have

109
00:09:56,160 --> 00:10:00,600
thought that when the trading price met the actual value of the shares, people would want

110
00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:05,800
to cash in and sell. After all, they knew that from that point onwards, the value of

111
00:10:05,800 --> 00:10:11,520
their shares would decline. But they didn't. They kept on buying, and so the trading price

112
00:10:11,520 --> 00:10:17,540
kept going up. It seemed that regardless of fundamental value, the more prices went up,

113
00:10:17,540 --> 00:10:22,360
the more people wanted to buy, and the more they wanted to buy, the more the prices went

114
00:10:22,360 --> 00:10:27,620
up. Halfway through, they were trading shares way above their actual value, and they were

115
00:10:27,640 --> 00:10:33,060
getting closer to the end of the game where the shares would be almost worthless. It was

116
00:10:33,060 --> 00:10:37,940
only when some traders lost their nerve and decided to cash in their profits that the

117
00:10:37,940 --> 00:10:42,900
price curve flattened out. When others saw that prices were no longer going up, there

118
00:10:42,900 --> 00:10:49,300
was a scramble to get out of the market. The result was a classic asset bubble, and Vernon

119
00:10:49,300 --> 00:10:54,960
Smith got the same bubble with different groups of people, even experienced market traders.

120
00:10:54,960 --> 00:11:01,960
Think about the housing bubble. Buyers, sellers, borrowers, lenders, real estate agents, government

121
00:11:03,680 --> 00:11:10,680
regulators, everybody believed that prices would rise and continue to rise. And that

122
00:11:12,120 --> 00:11:18,880
is kind of the essence of one of these, of a bubble. So substitute property prices for

123
00:11:18,880 --> 00:11:24,860
share prices, and we come back to the same puzzling question. Why don't buyers recognize

124
00:11:24,860 --> 00:11:31,300
the long-term reality? I don't have a Nobel Prize in economics, like Vernon Smith, so

125
00:11:31,300 --> 00:11:36,420
I'll let him give the answer, when he was asked the same question during an interview.

126
00:11:36,420 --> 00:11:39,180
They don't recognize that the value is declining or they don't care.

127
00:11:39,180 --> 00:11:46,180
Well, let me just say, right now, that we don't understand why it is that people get

128
00:11:46,540 --> 00:11:52,860
caught up in self-reinforcing expectations of rising prices.

129
00:11:52,860 --> 00:11:58,300
So there it is. We can understand the physics of why sea levels are rising, and we can measure

130
00:11:58,300 --> 00:12:05,300
that rise, but we still don't understand why humans make irrational economic decisions.

131
00:12:05,320 --> 00:12:09,620
Of course, there'll be a thousand Nobel Prize candidates in the comments forum with a thousand

132
00:12:09,620 --> 00:12:15,120
different theories explaining it, and they'll all be right. But whatever the reason, it's

133
00:12:15,120 --> 00:12:20,300
not a good idea to bet that because people make irrational or emotional decisions in

134
00:12:20,300 --> 00:12:23,860
the marketplace, then science must be wrong.

135
00:12:23,860 --> 00:12:29,420
A hundred years before the sea covers low-lying parts of South Florida may seem like a long

136
00:12:29,420 --> 00:12:36,340
time, but long before we get permanent inundation, the storm surges and king tides that occasionally

137
00:12:36,340 --> 00:12:42,480
flood the region will become more regular and more destructive. So anyone planning to

138
00:12:42,480 --> 00:12:47,860
sell a house 25 years from now, the life of a typical mortgage, will be trying to sell

139
00:12:47,860 --> 00:12:53,620
to people who know that saltwater will likely be invading their home dozens of times during

140
00:12:53,620 --> 00:13:00,020
the lifetime of their own mortgage. And the banks and insurance companies know that too.

141
00:13:00,020 --> 00:13:04,940
So more and more people are going to do what some forward-thinking buyers are already doing

142
00:13:04,940 --> 00:13:10,900
– weigh height above sea level into the value of the house and pay accordingly. And

143
00:13:10,900 --> 00:13:16,900
that point of hesitancy is the point at which the bubble starts to burst.

144
00:13:16,940 --> 00:13:23,000
Of course, you can say, that's no big deal, people will just move. And that's true.

145
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:27,460
The economy can probably absorb the collapse of the vulnerable part of the Florida real

146
00:13:27,460 --> 00:13:34,460
estate market, which is worth about $8.7 trillion. But the problem is a lot bigger than a few

147
00:13:34,460 --> 00:13:39,680
million residential homes in suburban Florida. For a start, there's the infrastructure

148
00:13:39,680 --> 00:13:45,260
in coastal cities all over the world, which is a lot more expensive and a lot harder to

149
00:13:45,260 --> 00:13:51,500
move. On top of that, there are more immediate problems associated with climate change, such

150
00:13:51,500 --> 00:13:58,220
as water shortages for billions of people as glaciers disappear, or wildfires, salination,

151
00:13:58,220 --> 00:14:03,780
disappearing coral reefs and fisheries, droughts and floods. If you think mitigating these

152
00:14:03,780 --> 00:14:08,900
problems involves some kind of world communist government, take a look at the video where

153
00:14:08,900 --> 00:14:13,980
I show what's being done to shift from fossil fuel energy to clean energy under the Free

154
00:14:13,980 --> 00:14:18,740
Enterprise system, you might be surprised.

155
00:14:18,740 --> 00:14:23,680
Before I go, I have to apologise to all those who say their posts aren't showing up or

156
00:14:23,680 --> 00:14:28,980
disappearing from the channel. Inevitably, there are accusations that I'm censoring

157
00:14:28,980 --> 00:14:33,800
criticism, which is clearly nonsense as you can see by reading through the hundreds of

158
00:14:33,800 --> 00:14:39,440
critical comments on my channel. What's happening is that YouTube is automatically

159
00:14:39,440 --> 00:14:45,040
sending a lot of posts directly to spam, both critical and supportive, for reasons

160
00:14:45,040 --> 00:14:50,880
that I can't fathom. Here are some of them in the spam folder, see what you can find

161
00:14:50,880 --> 00:14:56,400
wrong with those. Consequently, I have to clear out the spam folder every now and again,

162
00:14:56,400 --> 00:15:01,880
but it takes a long time and it's a pretty thankless task. So if your post doesn't

163
00:15:01,880 --> 00:15:06,520
show up, it's a good idea to make a copy of your comment before you post it, and if

164
00:15:06,520 --> 00:15:12,560
it doesn't show up, try again, or complain to YouTube. If your post is a violation of

165
00:15:12,560 --> 00:15:18,560
my channel rules against advertising, racism and plagiarism, then let me know why you think

166
00:15:18,560 --> 00:15:23,880
those rules are unfair. And on another issue, I've been successful

167
00:15:23,880 --> 00:15:29,260
in getting this channel monetised, but I was unsuccessful in getting it monetised for the

168
00:15:29,260 --> 00:15:34,800
benefit of the charity that I support, Health in Harmony. YouTube doesn't allow the content

169
00:15:34,800 --> 00:15:41,480
creator to be in one country and the beneficiary in another. I could of course allow advertisements,

170
00:15:41,480 --> 00:15:46,560
name myself as the beneficiary and pass the money on, but that leaves me open to claims

171
00:15:46,560 --> 00:15:51,300
that I've monetised this channel for my own benefit. A number of people have tried

172
00:15:51,300 --> 00:15:57,040
to claim that I'm making these videos for financial gain or deliberately making clickbait,

173
00:15:57,040 --> 00:16:01,600
and as long as the channel isn't monetised for my own benefit, those claims are pretty

174
00:16:01,600 --> 00:16:07,240
easily rebuffed. So rather than lay myself open to charges of profiting, I'd rather

175
00:16:07,240 --> 00:16:12,360
continue to make these videos for free and ask that people donate to the charity listed

176
00:16:12,360 --> 00:16:17,820
in the video description. Knowing that I'm helping them do important work in saving lives

177
00:16:17,820 --> 00:16:24,080
and protecting forests is what keeps me going. The only exception is going to be the occasional

178
00:16:24,080 --> 00:16:30,000
educational video, so out of the hundreds of videos I've made, I have monetised one.

179
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:35,600
This one. And I'm planning to make another on how mountains are formed, and I'll monetise

180
00:16:35,600 --> 00:16:40,880
that one too. Everything else is free. So thanks to those who've contributed to the

181
00:16:40,880 --> 00:16:47,540
charity, raising around $200,000, and I hope you'll continue to be generous as you watch

182
00:16:47,540 --> 00:16:48,360
more videos.
