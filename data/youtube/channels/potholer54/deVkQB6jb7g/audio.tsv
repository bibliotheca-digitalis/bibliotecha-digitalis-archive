0	4640	While I was writing my last video, I collected a bit of information about former President
4640	10480	Obama's house on the coast, because I was having an online discussion with someone.
10480	14460	In the end I decided it's not really worth debunking, because it didn't have much to
14460	20100	do with science. But then it was brought up as an argument in several posts responding
20100	26280	to that video, not just Obama buying coastal property, but also Al Gore, Nancy Pelosi and
26280	31980	Bill Gates. And it turns out this is also a big talking point on the blogosphere.
31980	37660	So I'll treat this as a legitimate question. If sea levels are rising, why are people who
37660	42880	accept the conclusions of oceanographers and climate scientists still buying beachfront
42880	48080	property? Isn't it all going to be underwater? asked one poster.
48080	53460	We'll start with Obama, and this question from a guest blog on WhatsUpWithThat.
53460	58260	Did Obama just buy a beachfront mansion? Rumours are flying that the owner of a beachfront
58260	63720	mansion in Hawaii is none other than President Obama, the same President who warns us that
63720	69000	global warming and rising sea levels are a greater danger to the future of America than
69000	75600	Islamic terrorism. I can now confirm that this story was in fact true. There were rumours
75600	81100	flying that Obama had bought a beachfront mansion in Hawaii. Unfortunately the rumours
81100	86520	turned out to be false. The property had been bought by the head of the Obama Foundation,
86520	92520	Marty Nesbitt. But that didn't prevent the rumours from being upgraded to actual fact.
92520	97720	However, while the Obamas didn't buy this oceanfront property, they did buy another
97720	104000	oceanfront property at Martha's Vineyard, so attention was switched to that. The WhatsUpWithThat
104000	109200	blog tried again. Sea level rise? Obama just bought a beachside
109200	116860	property. Well, not quite. The property is at 79 Turkiland Cove Road in Edgartown, Massachusetts,
116860	122340	which is several hundred metres from the beach and about ten feet above sea level. So if
122340	127620	President Obama really does follow the science, as he professes to do, then he knows that
127620	131940	storm surges aren't going to be an issue, and he knows that even at the extreme high
131940	137500	end of estimates, scientific projections show that the property will be permanently inundated
137520	144200	sometime after the year 2200. That's 180 years from now, by which time Barack and Michelle
144200	151200	will be about 250 years old, and not that bothered. Al Gore also came in for some flak
151200	156560	after buying this house right on the beach. Just a couple to three years after the Nobel
156560	163000	Peace Prize, he and Tipper, well tragically before their divorce, they went out and spent
163000	168380	$9 million on a mansion on the oceanfront in California.
168380	174020	One blogger wrote, Mr Gore just paid nearly $9 million for the property, which according
174020	180220	to his professed beliefs, will likely soon be literally underwater and hence worthless
180220	185940	both as a residence and for resale. The blogger rules out the possibility that Al Gore is
185940	191480	so dumb he'll buy a house he believes will be underwater likely soon, so that leaves
191480	197620	only one possibility, he says, that Mr Gore is a self-conscious, witting liar who doesn't
197620	202820	actually believe his predictions of doom. Of course, Al Gore may be a self-conscious,
202820	207660	witting liar who doesn't actually believe his predictions of doom, who knows? But there
207660	213300	is a very obvious third possibility, which is, way ahead of me, that his house is in
213300	220340	no danger from rising sea levels at all. For a start, this isn't his house. Al Gore's
220340	226880	house is at 1504 East Mountain Drive, Montecito, in the hills overlooking the town, and about
226880	232880	50 feet above sea level. So according to the scientific projections Al Gore professes to
232880	239320	believe his house should be underwater several hundred years after he's dead. I don't have
239320	244400	an exact address for John Kerry's house, but it doesn't matter. Most of Chilmark, where
244400	250000	he bought his house, is also comfortably more than 10 feet above sea level.
250000	255260	So let's try Nancy Pelosi's house. According to an anonymous tweet, and if you can't trust
255260	261240	anonymous tweets on the internet, who can you trust, Nancy bought this house. Clearly
261240	267520	it's right on the water. But sadly, it doesn't seem to belong to Nancy Pelosi. Her office
267520	273260	and the real estate agency selling the house said she isn't the buyer. So unless someone
273260	278500	has evidence other than a tweet, that claim is a non-starter.
278500	284880	The strongest contender is a beach house owned by Bill Gates at 2808 Oceanfront, Delmar,
284880	290440	California. It's not his main residence, but it is only a few feet above sea level and
290440	296440	right next to the beach. So Bill has only another hundred years or so to enjoy his beach
296440	302800	house, then at the age of 160 he'll either have to buy another one or spend more time
302800	308420	in his main residence, or one of the dozen other mansions he owns. The more immediate
308420	313520	problem for Bill is that long before the beach house gets inundated, he'll have to protect
313520	319420	it against storm surges and coastal erosion. The engineering work doesn't come cheap, maybe
319420	323940	upwards of a million dollars. So I hope he's got a bit of cash.
323940	328820	In sum, according to the scientific projections, these wealthy people don't have much to worry
328820	334660	about regardless of their political affiliation or beliefs. There's no scientific evidence
334660	339500	that sea levels will rise by several feet in the next few years, and as far as I know,
339500	344460	none of them has made that claim. Certainly there's no such claim made in the scientific
344460	347860	literature. If you really believe that sea level rise is
347860	354020	a problem, I will guarantee to buy that property for one dollar, because after all it's not
354020	357860	worth anything to you. Well, what a surprise. No one wants to sell
357900	362580	a house which will be snapped up on the market for millions of dollars for just a dollar.
362580	368540	I wonder why. Once again, not a great argument against the science.
368540	372780	In the end, it makes no difference to the science whether Al Gore and Barack Obama are
372780	378380	wonderful people or the most disgusting creatures on earth. Scientific facts are scientific
378380	383780	facts regardless. And the fact that their houses are safely out of harm's way doesn't
383780	388820	matter either. There are much more immediate problems to concern ourselves with than Al
388820	393220	Gore's basement getting flooded a thousand years from now.
393220	397620	So let's have a look at the more interesting question of why people buy beachfront properties
397620	402460	that really are vulnerable. If it's so close to disaster, why is it that
402460	407660	oceanfront mansions are selling better than ever? Record prices, record numbers.
407660	411960	That's a very good question. And not just for property with a limited lifetime due to
411960	417760	sea level rise, but also associated problems like subsidence, shifting sands and coastal
417760	421680	erosion. Even in Miami, where many of the scientists
421680	426560	say it's going to hit first and be worse there. Actually, I've heard that it's already happening.
426560	431720	That's right, it is. Some buyers are now taking height above sea level into consideration,
431720	436320	along with square footage and proximity to schools and stores when buying a house in
436320	442160	South Florida. And so are mortgage lenders and insurance companies. And that is having
442160	449560	some effect on property prices. But that's only some buyers. What about the rest?
449560	454840	This map of property prices shows that the most expensive areas, the darker green colours,
454840	460040	are along the coast. Why? Well, obviously one reason is that living
460040	466240	or retiring near the beach is a popular dream. So buyers over 40 aren't going to worry about
466240	471080	what will happen to their property due to rising sea levels in 50 years' time. By then
471080	477800	they'll be too old or too dead to care. And since only 73% of Americans believe the science
477800	482640	anyway, the rest will be quite happy to buy coastal property, whatever the projections
482640	486320	are. The buyers we need to look at are those who
486320	492160	do accept the science and plan to sell their properties in 20 or 30 years, or pass them
492160	498560	on to their offspring. They have a calculation to make. They know that in 100 years, scientific
498560	504280	projections show that the sea may be permanently covering the floor of a $400,000 house they
504280	511480	want to buy. So they know that somewhere between their house being worth $400,000 now and nothing
511480	517840	100 years from now, prices will have to stop rising at some point and start to fall. The
517840	522860	problem is that they don't know when that transition point will be. If they manage to
522860	528280	sell before the decline begins, then they get to enjoy the beach lifestyle they want
528280	534320	for a limited time and then sell at a healthy profit. But if they don't, then they risk
534320	539160	being left holding a property few people want to buy in a falling market. There were some
539160	545320	interesting experiments conducted along these lines by economist Vernon Smith in the 1980s
545320	551320	which showed this very starkly. Test subjects were given some money and told to trade imaginary
551320	557320	shares. They were told the real value of each share would start at $3.60 and decline over
557320	564680	time. So at the end of the game, any shares they had left would be worth just $0.24. As
564680	569080	an incentive to try as hard as they could to make a profit, they were allowed to keep
569080	573780	whatever profit they made at the end of the experiment.
573780	578340	To begin with, the shares were offered to them at a lower price than their actual value,
578340	585060	usually around $2 a share, just like a real IPO, and then they started trading. Obviously
585060	590060	since the test subjects knew the shares were worth more than the $2 trading price, they
590060	596160	started buying shares, and the trading price therefore moved upwards. Now you would have
596160	600600	thought that when the trading price met the actual value of the shares, people would want
600600	605800	to cash in and sell. After all, they knew that from that point onwards, the value of
605800	611520	their shares would decline. But they didn't. They kept on buying, and so the trading price
611520	617540	kept going up. It seemed that regardless of fundamental value, the more prices went up,
617540	622360	the more people wanted to buy, and the more they wanted to buy, the more the prices went
622360	627620	up. Halfway through, they were trading shares way above their actual value, and they were
627640	633060	getting closer to the end of the game where the shares would be almost worthless. It was
633060	637940	only when some traders lost their nerve and decided to cash in their profits that the
637940	642900	price curve flattened out. When others saw that prices were no longer going up, there
642900	649300	was a scramble to get out of the market. The result was a classic asset bubble, and Vernon
649300	654960	Smith got the same bubble with different groups of people, even experienced market traders.
654960	661960	Think about the housing bubble. Buyers, sellers, borrowers, lenders, real estate agents, government
663680	670680	regulators, everybody believed that prices would rise and continue to rise. And that
672120	678880	is kind of the essence of one of these, of a bubble. So substitute property prices for
678880	684860	share prices, and we come back to the same puzzling question. Why don't buyers recognize
684860	691300	the long-term reality? I don't have a Nobel Prize in economics, like Vernon Smith, so
691300	696420	I'll let him give the answer, when he was asked the same question during an interview.
696420	699180	They don't recognize that the value is declining or they don't care.
699180	706180	Well, let me just say, right now, that we don't understand why it is that people get
706540	712860	caught up in self-reinforcing expectations of rising prices.
712860	718300	So there it is. We can understand the physics of why sea levels are rising, and we can measure
718300	725300	that rise, but we still don't understand why humans make irrational economic decisions.
725320	729620	Of course, there'll be a thousand Nobel Prize candidates in the comments forum with a thousand
729620	735120	different theories explaining it, and they'll all be right. But whatever the reason, it's
735120	740300	not a good idea to bet that because people make irrational or emotional decisions in
740300	743860	the marketplace, then science must be wrong.
743860	749420	A hundred years before the sea covers low-lying parts of South Florida may seem like a long
749420	756340	time, but long before we get permanent inundation, the storm surges and king tides that occasionally
756340	762480	flood the region will become more regular and more destructive. So anyone planning to
762480	767860	sell a house 25 years from now, the life of a typical mortgage, will be trying to sell
767860	773620	to people who know that saltwater will likely be invading their home dozens of times during
773620	780020	the lifetime of their own mortgage. And the banks and insurance companies know that too.
780020	784940	So more and more people are going to do what some forward-thinking buyers are already doing
784940	790900	– weigh height above sea level into the value of the house and pay accordingly. And
790900	796900	that point of hesitancy is the point at which the bubble starts to burst.
796940	803000	Of course, you can say, that's no big deal, people will just move. And that's true.
803000	807460	The economy can probably absorb the collapse of the vulnerable part of the Florida real
807460	814460	estate market, which is worth about $8.7 trillion. But the problem is a lot bigger than a few
814460	819680	million residential homes in suburban Florida. For a start, there's the infrastructure
819680	825260	in coastal cities all over the world, which is a lot more expensive and a lot harder to
825260	831500	move. On top of that, there are more immediate problems associated with climate change, such
831500	838220	as water shortages for billions of people as glaciers disappear, or wildfires, salination,
838220	843780	disappearing coral reefs and fisheries, droughts and floods. If you think mitigating these
843780	848900	problems involves some kind of world communist government, take a look at the video where
848900	853980	I show what's being done to shift from fossil fuel energy to clean energy under the Free
853980	858740	Enterprise system, you might be surprised.
858740	863680	Before I go, I have to apologise to all those who say their posts aren't showing up or
863680	868980	disappearing from the channel. Inevitably, there are accusations that I'm censoring
868980	873800	criticism, which is clearly nonsense as you can see by reading through the hundreds of
873800	879440	critical comments on my channel. What's happening is that YouTube is automatically
879440	885040	sending a lot of posts directly to spam, both critical and supportive, for reasons
885040	890880	that I can't fathom. Here are some of them in the spam folder, see what you can find
890880	896400	wrong with those. Consequently, I have to clear out the spam folder every now and again,
896400	901880	but it takes a long time and it's a pretty thankless task. So if your post doesn't
901880	906520	show up, it's a good idea to make a copy of your comment before you post it, and if
906520	912560	it doesn't show up, try again, or complain to YouTube. If your post is a violation of
912560	918560	my channel rules against advertising, racism and plagiarism, then let me know why you think
918560	923880	those rules are unfair. And on another issue, I've been successful
923880	929260	in getting this channel monetised, but I was unsuccessful in getting it monetised for the
929260	934800	benefit of the charity that I support, Health in Harmony. YouTube doesn't allow the content
934800	941480	creator to be in one country and the beneficiary in another. I could of course allow advertisements,
941480	946560	name myself as the beneficiary and pass the money on, but that leaves me open to claims
946560	951300	that I've monetised this channel for my own benefit. A number of people have tried
951300	957040	to claim that I'm making these videos for financial gain or deliberately making clickbait,
957040	961600	and as long as the channel isn't monetised for my own benefit, those claims are pretty
961600	967240	easily rebuffed. So rather than lay myself open to charges of profiting, I'd rather
967240	972360	continue to make these videos for free and ask that people donate to the charity listed
972360	977820	in the video description. Knowing that I'm helping them do important work in saving lives
977820	984080	and protecting forests is what keeps me going. The only exception is going to be the occasional
984080	990000	educational video, so out of the hundreds of videos I've made, I have monetised one.
990000	995600	This one. And I'm planning to make another on how mountains are formed, and I'll monetise
995600	1000880	that one too. Everything else is free. So thanks to those who've contributed to the
1000880	1007540	charity, raising around $200,000, and I hope you'll continue to be generous as you watch
1007540	1008360	more videos.
