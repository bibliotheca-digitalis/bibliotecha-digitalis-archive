1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
I'm just wondering what the heck is in our water supply.

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:09,000
What the heck is in our oxygen supply of the metallic

3
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:15,000
oxide salts that create a rainbow effect in a sprinkler?

4
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:20,000
What is oozing out of our ground that allows this

5
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:23,000
type of effect to happen?

6
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:26,000
Not just around our sun and our moon anymore.

7
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:35,000
Everywhere we look, the visible spectrum is rainbows.

8
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:37,000
This cannot be natural.

9
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:40,000
If proof was ever needed of a government conspiracy,

10
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:43,000
then this rainbow in a sprinkler is surely it.

11
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:46,000
After all, the authorities claim they're spending money

12
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:49,000
on science education in schools, but this video shows

13
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:52,000
that in fact the government is conspiring to suck

14
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:55,000
the intelligence out of people who should have at least

15
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:58,000
got a basic understanding of science in elementary school.

16
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:01,000
The title at the opening of this creepy sprinkler video

17
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:04,000
gives an alternative explanation.

18
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:07,000
Rainbows are caused by something called HAARP.

19
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:10,000
It's basically a phased array radar that sends up to

20
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:14,000
3.6 megawatts of electromagnetic radiation into the ionosphere,

21
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:17,000
which heats it up over a narrow range.

22
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:20,000
What makes this a godsend for conspiracy theorists

23
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:23,000
is that the research may have a military application.

24
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:26,000
The theory is that by sending radio waves through the ionosphere,

25
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:30,000
what gets bounced back will be longer wavelength radiation

26
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:33,000
that can act like ground-penetrating radar.

27
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:37,000
But the fact that it's a secret installation run by the military

28
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:40,000
sending invisible beams into space and then into the Earth,

29
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:44,000
well, that's enough to excite any conspiracy theorist.

30
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:49,000
Now, the top secret government project that can destroy the world.

31
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:53,000
So every pet conspiracy theory from hurricanes to mind control,

32
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:56,000
and of course rainbow after rainbow after rainbow,

33
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:59,000
has now been attacked to HAARP.

34
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:02,000
Back at his war room, the governor meets with his elite team

35
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:05,000
of investigators, researchers and operatives,

36
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:07,000
all of them itching to get on the case.

37
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:10,000
Here's Jesse Ventura investigating HAARP's triggering

38
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:15,000
of the 2010 Boxing Day tsunami that hit large parts of South East Asia.

39
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:18,000
This photo was actually taken just before the big tsunami

40
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,000
hit the coast of Indonesia.

41
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:23,000
What we're seeing is the aurora borealis or the northern lights.

42
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:26,000
They occur anytime there's any sort of electromagnetic occurrence

43
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:29,000
in the ionosphere, and they say that when they turn HAARP on,

44
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:31,000
the colours get really wild up there.

45
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:36,000
There's no need for dramatic music or speculation about secret conspiracies.

46
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:39,000
Researchers working at HAARP are quite open about the fact that HAARP

47
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:42,000
does excite charged particles in the upper atmosphere,

48
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,000
and that produces colours in the sky.

49
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:47,000
You can even read about these experiments in published papers,

50
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:50,000
where the physics is explained.

51
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:54,000
But portraying this as some kind of discovery allows Jesse Ventura

52
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:57,000
to enter the wild world of speculation,

53
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:00,000
and wonder what else HAARP might be secretly doing.

54
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:05,000
His elite investigator, Rahim, tells us this photo of the aurora borealis

55
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:10,000
is evidence of a link between HAARP and the tsunami of Boxing Day 2010,

56
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:13,000
because the photo was taken just before the tsunami struck.

57
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:18,000
This photo was actually taken just before the big tsunami hit the coast of Indonesia.

58
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:22,000
When exactly? We don't know. Who took it? Don't know that either.

59
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:26,000
So how do we know it was taken just before the tsunami?

60
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:30,000
Of course, conspiracy theorists will tell me I'm naive to be so sceptical.

61
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:34,000
Why am I so resistant to the idea that this aurora happened

62
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:37,000
when Jesse Ventura's investigation says it happened,

63
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:40,000
and that it has some connection to the tsunami?

64
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,000
Well, I'll tell you why.

65
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:47,000
Because before I'm gullible enough to believe some spectacular claim I hear on TV,

66
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:49,000
I have the sense to check it,

67
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:54,000
and in this case it meant taking the conspiracy show logo off the bottom of the photo

68
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:57,000
and doing a search for it on Google Images.

69
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:02,000
And presto, I discovered exactly the same photo on sale for $24

70
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:05,000
at Dave Miller's Posters Wanted website.

71
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:09,000
Not only is there no indication that this commercial picture was taken before,

72
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:14,000
or even in the same decade as the tsunami, it's not even in the same hemisphere.

73
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:19,000
Rahim says this is the Aurora Borealis, the Northern Lights.

74
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:24,000
In fact, it's advertised as the Aurora Australis, the Southern Lights.

75
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:28,000
So the photo that's supposed to show how a military death machine was activated

76
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:33,000
just before a major earthquake has in fact been lifted off the internet for $24

77
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:37,000
by Jesse Ventura's team of elite investigators.

78
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:40,000
The other thing that's interesting before the tsunami

79
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:44,000
was that there were no pre-tremors or any warning. It just happened.

80
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:46,000
Now, I'm not an elite investigator,

81
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:51,000
and I don't have the resources of Jesse Ventura's elite investigation team,

82
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:55,000
but it took me just a few minutes to check this claim that the tsunami just happened

83
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:58,000
and wasn't preceded by an earthquake.

84
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:03,000
Here, for example, is a seismological record of the supposedly non-existent earthquake,

85
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:07,000
and here are some scientific papers detailing the mechanism of the earthquake.

86
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:11,000
So where did elite investigator June Sarpong go wrong,

87
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:15,000
apart from not checking publicly available records?

88
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:18,000
I think she probably heard interviews with survivors who said

89
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:21,000
they hadn't felt an earthquake before the tsunami hit,

90
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:24,000
so she simply assumed there wasn't one.

91
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:27,000
A shame she didn't talk to a seismologist who could have told her

92
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:30,000
that tsunami are often experienced over a much wider area

93
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:33,000
than the earthquake that causes them.

94
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:36,000
In 1960, for example, there was a devastating tsunami

95
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:41,000
that destroyed downtown Hilo in Hawaii and killed 61 people,

96
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:43,000
but no one felt any tremor.

97
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:46,000
The same tsunami killed 138 people in Japan,

98
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:49,000
and again there was no warning tremor.

99
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:54,000
That's because the earthquake happened in Chile, on the other side of the Pacific.

100
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:58,000
So while people close to the origins of tsunami do feel an earthquake,

101
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:01,000
especially if they're standing on soft ground or in tall buildings,

102
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:04,000
people living far away don't.

103
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:08,000
But clearly there's no time for the elite team to check any of these facts.

104
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,000
The conspiracy theory has already moved on.

105
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:13,000
How often are the Northern Lights spotted in Indonesia?

106
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:17,000
Why would we want to cause a tsunami and kill thousands of Indonesian people?

107
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:19,000
Alex, maybe they didn't want to.

108
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:22,000
Maybe they were just experimenting with the thing.

109
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:25,000
They put it up too high and this was the end result.

110
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:27,000
What do you think they're going to do after it happens?

111
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:30,000
Then come out and say, oops, we made a mistake and fess up to it?

112
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:31,000
Yeah, Alex.

113
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:33,000
Think about it, they're testing a whole new technology.

114
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:34,000
But notice what's happened.

115
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:37,000
In the space of just a few minutes we've jumped from the question of

116
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:42,000
whether HAARP caused the tsunami to why HAARP caused the tsunami,

117
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:46,000
even though on the first question we haven't been given one shred of evidence

118
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:50,000
apart from the fabricated description of a photo that came from a commercial poster company

119
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:55,000
and June's erroneous assumption about the link between tsunami and seismic tremors.

120
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:59,000
The science and the evidence, well, they're just nitpicky details.

121
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:01,000
Fact checking is boring.

122
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:05,000
Conspiracy theories are all about uncovering the big picture.

123
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:07,000
From the war room.

124
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:12,000
Of course, HAARP has now been tied with that other great conspiracy of the 21st century,

125
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:14,000
so-called chemtrails.

126
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:18,000
The theory is that the government is spraying something over the skies

127
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:21,000
and it's doing something to us or the environment.

128
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:27,000
The problem for me is that chemtrails seem to be completely indistinguishable from contrails,

129
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:31,000
particles of ice that form from water vapour released by aircraft engines.

130
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:34,000
Conspiracy theories say they're different.

131
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:39,000
The chemtrails linger in the atmosphere, whereas contrails don't.

132
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:42,000
Well, it's a pretty undefined and wussy definition.

133
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:45,000
But speaking qualitatively, contrails have been doing what they do

134
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:47,000
ever since planes flew the stratosphere.

135
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:50,000
Fire and fire into the lifeless stratosphere,

136
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:55,000
until the exhaust of the engines mixing with the cold thin air condenses

137
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:58,000
and streams the heavens with paper trails.

138
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:05,000
But just as I was despairing of finding any evidence that these are anything other than condensation trails,

139
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:07,000
suddenly I find it.

140
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:12,000
Secret film from inside the cockpit of one of these chemtrail spraying jets.

141
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:14,000
What a lucky break.

142
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:17,000
Well, there you go.

143
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:21,000
If you're a sceptic, you'll want to know where and when the footage was taken,

144
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:24,000
why the camera suddenly shifts position from the back of the cockpit

145
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:27,000
to the lap of whoever's slowly flipping the switch,

146
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:32,000
and why the word chemtrail has been written on sticky tape and plastered over a switch,

147
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:36,000
in what any aviator will recognise as the console controlling lighting

148
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:39,000
for the primary flight and navigation displays.

149
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:42,000
If you're a conspiracy theorist, this footage will no doubt excite you

150
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:45,000
with clear evidence of deliberate chemical spraying.

151
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:49,000
The term conspiracy theory was first coined in the 1960s

152
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:52,000
to describe a theory that Lee Harvey Oswald didn't act alone

153
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:55,000
when he assassinated President Kennedy.

154
00:08:55,000 --> 00:09:00,000
It was called a conspiracy to distinguish itself from a one-man operation.

155
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:05,000
These days, the term is applied to just about anything that may or may not be going on in secret,

156
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:07,000
which is a pretty broad brush.

157
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:08,000
Don't forget Watergate.

158
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:12,000
Yes, OK, look, I'm not denying that things go on in secret,

159
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:15,000
if that's now the definition of a conspiracy.

160
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:18,000
But let's take Watergate as a prime example.

161
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:23,000
It took months of solid investigation to tie President Nixon to the Watergate cover-up.

162
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:26,000
The Washington Post, where the story was first broken,

163
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:31,000
insisted on getting every fact checked and confirmed by separate sources.

164
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:36,000
These days, a conspiracy theory takes as long to prove as it takes to type into a blog.

165
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:39,000
When the Princess of Wales was killed in 1997,

166
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:44,000
I went straight to the computer and searched the words Diana and conspiracy,

167
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:48,000
and on the day of her death, there were already dozens of conspiracy theories

168
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:50,000
claiming she had been murdered,

169
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:54,000
based on the fact that the ambulance carrying her travelled very slowly

170
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:57,000
and it didn't take her to the nearest hospital.

171
00:09:57,000 --> 00:10:02,000
But jumping so quickly to a conspiracy theory leaves no time to answer the question,

172
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:07,000
why did the ambulance travel so slowly and not go to the nearest hospital?

173
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:11,000
Of course, there is an explanation, and you'll find it in the video description,

174
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:14,000
but once a conspiracy theory has been cobbled together

175
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:20,000
on the basis of whatever sparse information is available in the first few hours, it sticks.

176
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:25,000
It seems impossible for conspiracy theorists to accept that it was wrong.

177
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:31,000
Likewise, just hours after thousands of private emails were leaked from the University of East Anglia,

178
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:36,000
a conspiracy theory had formed before anyone had time to read them all, let alone understand them.

179
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:43,000
Some of these alleged emails may actually hold the key or actually the clues

180
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:48,000
to prove that the theory of global warming is a huge conspiracy.

181
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:53,000
For example, there is one email coming from one scientist,

182
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:59,000
and in this alleged email, the scientist claims that he had to use additional data

183
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:03,000
in order to hide the decline of global temperatures.

184
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:06,000
Of course, that turned out to be complete nonsense,

185
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:10,000
and we now know the email wasn't claiming anything of the sort.

186
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:17,000
These hastily drawn conclusions try to adopt the veneer of a real investigation like Watergate the easy way

187
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:21,000
by simply adding the suffix gate to the conspiracy.

188
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:24,000
And of course, copy Watergate jargon.

189
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:27,000
Now of course, in the Watergate investigation,

190
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:32,000
follow the money meant trace the source of the money paid to the Watergate burglars.

191
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:37,000
By backtracking checks and funds, the trail led to the committee to re-elect the president,

192
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:41,000
and it gave reporters Woodward and Bernstein the evidence they needed

193
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:44,000
to show a link between the burglars and the White House.

194
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:49,000
Conspiracy theorists have stuck the phrase to their own brand of investigative reporting,

195
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:54,000
which is to simply show that money paid to researchers comes from research grants.

196
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:56,000
Wow, well done!

197
00:11:56,000 --> 00:12:02,000
This astonishing discovery can be applied to, well, just about anyone engaged in scientific research.

198
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:08,000
The implication is that researchers will discover whatever the government wants them to discover.

199
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:12,000
Well, there are a few things I don't get about this conspiracy theory.

200
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:15,000
Scientists doing basic research are the cream of their profession,

201
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:19,000
PhDs who could command high salaries if they worked in industry.

202
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:23,000
They don't get paid much for working in university research.

203
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:27,000
In my experience, they do it because they love discovering new things,

204
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:32,000
and for most of them, a goal is to make a groundbreaking discovery and perhaps win a Nobel Prize.

205
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:39,000
Well, you're not going to do that by fabricating your data in order to get the same results as everyone else.

206
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:42,000
Fabricating results means you risk getting kicked out of your job

207
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:45,000
and losing all credibility in your profession.

208
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:51,000
The accolades in science go to overturning the conventional wisdom, not confirming it.

209
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:56,000
And in the case of climate research, where the mantra follow the money is most often applied,

210
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:59,000
if climate researchers are faking their results to please the government,

211
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:05,000
why didn't American scientists under George Bush Sr. and Canadian scientists under the current government

212
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:10,000
start pouring out papers showing there's no link between CO2 and global temperature?

213
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:15,000
After all, both administrations were and are hostile to action on climate change

214
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:19,000
and would love to get supporting evidence from the scientific community.

215
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:22,000
But if this makes no sense to you, then there's another theory to explain

216
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:26,000
why the research continues to show a link between CO2 and global temperatures.

217
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:31,000
Apparently, climate scientists want to install a world Marxist government run by the UN.

218
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:36,000
You know, the New World Order. And climate scientists aren't the only ones.

219
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:40,000
Evolution is also the foundation philosophy for the New World Order.

220
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:43,000
Evil men have already divided up the world into regions,

221
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:46,000
and they've got it all planned. They want to rule the world.

222
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:49,000
Their goal is to reduce the population to a half billion,

223
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:53,000
with a few of them as the elite get to rule the world.

224
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:57,000
Of course, a conspiracy theory is never ever wrong.

225
00:13:57,000 --> 00:14:02,000
So when real evidence comes along to dispute it, the only way out is to claim fraud.

226
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:05,000
And if the evidence has been confirmed by other researchers,

227
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:08,000
then they must be in on the conspiracy too.

228
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:10,000
And if their research has been peer reviewed,

229
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:13,000
then the peer reviewers must be part of the conspiracy

230
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:16,000
and the scientific journals that publish the research papers.

231
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:20,000
And if public inquiries find no evidence of fraud or fabrication,

232
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:24,000
then of course they must all be in on the conspiracy.

233
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:27,000
That's why a conspiracy theory can never ever be wrong.

234
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:31,000
The number of conspirators simply expands to accommodate it.

235
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:33,000
If you want to study some of the conspiracies, if you get into that kind of stuff,

236
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:35,000
there have been numerous conspiracies.

237
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:37,000
Get the Medusa file, or the American conspiracy,

238
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:41,000
New American magazine, the conspiracy, to see what's really happening.

239
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:43,000
Many folks are convinced the government was involved

240
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:46,000
in taking down the building in Oklahoma City.

241
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:49,000
And same thing with the Twin Tower bombing.

242
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:52,000
Where were all the other security cameras aimed?

243
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:57,000
We were sent some photographs that were taken apparently right after the event.

244
00:14:57,000 --> 00:15:00,000
We also had a report about a gas station

245
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:03,000
whose video camera was pointed in the exact direction

246
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:06,000
where the 757 would have hit the Pentagon.

247
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:11,000
Shortly after the event, it was reported that federal officials

248
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:14,000
showed up at that gas station and confiscated that footage.

249
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:19,000
If someone like Pothola54 were to do a 9-11 conspiracy debunk video

250
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:22,000
as convincingly as he did at debunking ancient aliens,

251
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:25,000
I would be forced to pause and reconsider.

252
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:28,000
Thanks, I'm flattered, but why should I debunk this

253
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:32,000
when I'm sure you're perfectly capable of debunking it yourself?

254
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:36,000
As I've said before, I'm not doing anything brilliant or extraordinary in my videos,

255
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:41,000
simply verifying claims by checking sources, which anyone can do.

256
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:44,000
If you watch any of the videos or you've been unfortunate enough

257
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:48,000
to be cornered by one of these 9-11 conspiracy theorists at a party

258
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:53,000
and have had your ear chewed off for over an hour about all the evidence,

259
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:57,000
you'll know that it's all based on quotes from people who believe they heard a bomb,

260
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:59,000
people who believe they saw a missile,

261
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:03,000
people who feel there's something in one of the photos or missing from the photos,

262
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:07,000
or who feel that buildings and airlines shouldn't have acted the way they did.

263
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:11,000
Conspiracy theorists insist that all these unsourced reports

264
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:16,000
and assumptions and speculation raise questions, to which I say, great.

265
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:19,000
Then do what real investigative reporters do,

266
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:22,000
put your coat on and go and find the answers.

267
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:26,000
Real conspiracies have been uncovered by answering questions,

268
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:31,000
not by sitting in front of a computer screen and wondering why something looks or feels wrong.

269
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:34,000
Just say, hey, no smoking in here, what do you want?

270
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:38,000
You know, I'm about to talk about this whole, you know, microchipping.

271
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:40,000
Microchipping? What?

272
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:41,000
Obamacare and...

273
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:43,000
OK, can you go away and put a shirt on?

274
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:47,000
Here's one of the websites that got the shirtless smoker so agitated.

275
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:50,000
It's about a microchip, widely reported in the media,

276
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:55,000
that can hold important health data on individuals who suffer from debilitating illness.

277
00:16:55,000 --> 00:17:01,000
But nowhere does it give any evidence that Americans will be forcibly implanted with microchips,

278
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:07,000
and on the basis of this essay filled with rumour and belief, the shirtless smoker believes it too.

279
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:11,000
And so does the preacher who's about to go, what?

280
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:17,000
What? Are we talking about a microchip that they want to put in your hand?

281
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:23,000
Folks, it's already the law of the land. It was passed in the Obamacare bill.

282
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:28,000
It was? Does anyone have the relevant passage in the bill?

283
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:31,000
Yes, this is the passage they all refer to.

284
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:35,000
But of course it doesn't say that all Americans have to be microchipped at all.

285
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:41,000
It mandates the establishment of a national registry of people who have implantable devices,

286
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:44,000
such as pacemakers, to monitor safety and outcomes.

287
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:48,000
But so certain are the conspiracy theorists that they must be right

288
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:52,000
that they even put a date by which all Americans would be forcibly microchipped.

289
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:55,000
March 23rd, 2013.

290
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:57,000
Whoops.

291
00:17:57,000 --> 00:18:00,000
But let's bring all this bang up to date.

292
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:06,000
I had a small bet with myself that even the Boston Marathon bombing would by now have spawned its own conspiracy,

293
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:08,000
and sure enough it has.

294
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:12,000
It comes courtesy of the Russian government's channel Russia Today,

295
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:16,000
and we know how reliable they are when it comes to checking facts.

296
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:21,000
These days you'll find a conspiracy theory surrounding any event almost as soon as it happens,

297
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:25,000
and if you're not convinced by the sparse and speculative evidence provided,

298
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:29,000
the conspiracy theorist will resort to a common fallback position.

299
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:32,000
You don't think this is possible? Seriously?

300
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:36,000
You trust the government? You think big business is working in your interests?

301
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:40,000
Well, yeah, conspiracies exist. Come on.

302
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:43,000
Yes, they do. But murders also exist.

303
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:47,000
It doesn't mean everyone who comes to your door is a murderer.

304
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:49,000
Do I trust the government? No.

305
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:56,000
The difference between you and me is that I don't trust the information I see in internet blogs or videos either.

306
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:59,000
I look for their sources, if they have any, and check them.

307
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:06,000
Unlike you, I want to know the answers to questions, not treat questions as if they were answers.

308
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:09,000
Unlike you, I don't swallow unverified claims,

309
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:15,000
or form instant conclusions based on nothing more than hearsay, feelings, beliefs, ifs and maybes.

310
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:19,000
That doesn't make me smarter than you or any better educated,

311
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:23,000
but it does mean I'm more sceptical and far less gullible.

312
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:32,000
We all know it wasn't something that happened 20 years ago, but now it's happening now.
