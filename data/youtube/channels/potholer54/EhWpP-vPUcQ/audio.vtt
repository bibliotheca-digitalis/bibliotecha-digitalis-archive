00:00.000 --> 00:04.000
I'm just wondering what the heck is in our water supply.

00:04.000 --> 00:09.000
What the heck is in our oxygen supply of the metallic

00:09.000 --> 00:15.000
oxide salts that create a rainbow effect in a sprinkler?

00:15.000 --> 00:20.000
What is oozing out of our ground that allows this

00:20.000 --> 00:23.000
type of effect to happen?

00:23.000 --> 00:26.000
Not just around our sun and our moon anymore.

00:26.000 --> 00:35.000
Everywhere we look, the visible spectrum is rainbows.

00:35.000 --> 00:37.000
This cannot be natural.

00:37.000 --> 00:40.000
If proof was ever needed of a government conspiracy,

00:40.000 --> 00:43.000
then this rainbow in a sprinkler is surely it.

00:43.000 --> 00:46.000
After all, the authorities claim they're spending money

00:46.000 --> 00:49.000
on science education in schools, but this video shows

00:49.000 --> 00:52.000
that in fact the government is conspiring to suck

00:52.000 --> 00:55.000
the intelligence out of people who should have at least

00:55.000 --> 00:58.000
got a basic understanding of science in elementary school.

00:58.000 --> 01:01.000
The title at the opening of this creepy sprinkler video

01:01.000 --> 01:04.000
gives an alternative explanation.

01:04.000 --> 01:07.000
Rainbows are caused by something called HAARP.

01:07.000 --> 01:10.000
It's basically a phased array radar that sends up to

01:10.000 --> 01:14.000
3.6 megawatts of electromagnetic radiation into the ionosphere,

01:14.000 --> 01:17.000
which heats it up over a narrow range.

01:17.000 --> 01:20.000
What makes this a godsend for conspiracy theorists

01:20.000 --> 01:23.000
is that the research may have a military application.

01:23.000 --> 01:26.000
The theory is that by sending radio waves through the ionosphere,

01:26.000 --> 01:30.000
what gets bounced back will be longer wavelength radiation

01:30.000 --> 01:33.000
that can act like ground-penetrating radar.

01:33.000 --> 01:37.000
But the fact that it's a secret installation run by the military

01:37.000 --> 01:40.000
sending invisible beams into space and then into the Earth,

01:40.000 --> 01:44.000
well, that's enough to excite any conspiracy theorist.

01:44.000 --> 01:49.000
Now, the top secret government project that can destroy the world.

01:49.000 --> 01:53.000
So every pet conspiracy theory from hurricanes to mind control,

01:53.000 --> 01:56.000
and of course rainbow after rainbow after rainbow,

01:56.000 --> 01:59.000
has now been attacked to HAARP.

01:59.000 --> 02:02.000
Back at his war room, the governor meets with his elite team

02:02.000 --> 02:05.000
of investigators, researchers and operatives,

02:05.000 --> 02:07.000
all of them itching to get on the case.

02:07.000 --> 02:10.000
Here's Jesse Ventura investigating HAARP's triggering

02:10.000 --> 02:15.000
of the 2010 Boxing Day tsunami that hit large parts of South East Asia.

02:15.000 --> 02:18.000
This photo was actually taken just before the big tsunami

02:18.000 --> 02:20.000
hit the coast of Indonesia.

02:20.000 --> 02:23.000
What we're seeing is the aurora borealis or the northern lights.

02:23.000 --> 02:26.000
They occur anytime there's any sort of electromagnetic occurrence

02:26.000 --> 02:29.000
in the ionosphere, and they say that when they turn HAARP on,

02:29.000 --> 02:31.000
the colours get really wild up there.

02:31.000 --> 02:36.000
There's no need for dramatic music or speculation about secret conspiracies.

02:36.000 --> 02:39.000
Researchers working at HAARP are quite open about the fact that HAARP

02:39.000 --> 02:42.000
does excite charged particles in the upper atmosphere,

02:42.000 --> 02:44.000
and that produces colours in the sky.

02:44.000 --> 02:47.000
You can even read about these experiments in published papers,

02:47.000 --> 02:50.000
where the physics is explained.

02:50.000 --> 02:54.000
But portraying this as some kind of discovery allows Jesse Ventura

02:54.000 --> 02:57.000
to enter the wild world of speculation,

02:57.000 --> 03:00.000
and wonder what else HAARP might be secretly doing.

03:00.000 --> 03:05.000
His elite investigator, Rahim, tells us this photo of the aurora borealis

03:05.000 --> 03:10.000
is evidence of a link between HAARP and the tsunami of Boxing Day 2010,

03:10.000 --> 03:13.000
because the photo was taken just before the tsunami struck.

03:13.000 --> 03:18.000
This photo was actually taken just before the big tsunami hit the coast of Indonesia.

03:18.000 --> 03:22.000
When exactly? We don't know. Who took it? Don't know that either.

03:22.000 --> 03:26.000
So how do we know it was taken just before the tsunami?

03:26.000 --> 03:30.000
Of course, conspiracy theorists will tell me I'm naive to be so sceptical.

03:30.000 --> 03:34.000
Why am I so resistant to the idea that this aurora happened

03:34.000 --> 03:37.000
when Jesse Ventura's investigation says it happened,

03:37.000 --> 03:40.000
and that it has some connection to the tsunami?

03:40.000 --> 03:42.000
Well, I'll tell you why.

03:42.000 --> 03:47.000
Because before I'm gullible enough to believe some spectacular claim I hear on TV,

03:47.000 --> 03:49.000
I have the sense to check it,

03:49.000 --> 03:54.000
and in this case it meant taking the conspiracy show logo off the bottom of the photo

03:54.000 --> 03:57.000
and doing a search for it on Google Images.

03:57.000 --> 04:02.000
And presto, I discovered exactly the same photo on sale for $24

04:02.000 --> 04:05.000
at Dave Miller's Posters Wanted website.

04:05.000 --> 04:09.000
Not only is there no indication that this commercial picture was taken before,

04:09.000 --> 04:14.000
or even in the same decade as the tsunami, it's not even in the same hemisphere.

04:14.000 --> 04:19.000
Rahim says this is the Aurora Borealis, the Northern Lights.

04:19.000 --> 04:24.000
In fact, it's advertised as the Aurora Australis, the Southern Lights.

04:24.000 --> 04:28.000
So the photo that's supposed to show how a military death machine was activated

04:28.000 --> 04:33.000
just before a major earthquake has in fact been lifted off the internet for $24

04:33.000 --> 04:37.000
by Jesse Ventura's team of elite investigators.

04:37.000 --> 04:40.000
The other thing that's interesting before the tsunami

04:40.000 --> 04:44.000
was that there were no pre-tremors or any warning. It just happened.

04:44.000 --> 04:46.000
Now, I'm not an elite investigator,

04:46.000 --> 04:51.000
and I don't have the resources of Jesse Ventura's elite investigation team,

04:51.000 --> 04:55.000
but it took me just a few minutes to check this claim that the tsunami just happened

04:55.000 --> 04:58.000
and wasn't preceded by an earthquake.

04:58.000 --> 05:03.000
Here, for example, is a seismological record of the supposedly non-existent earthquake,

05:03.000 --> 05:07.000
and here are some scientific papers detailing the mechanism of the earthquake.

05:07.000 --> 05:11.000
So where did elite investigator June Sarpong go wrong,

05:11.000 --> 05:15.000
apart from not checking publicly available records?

05:15.000 --> 05:18.000
I think she probably heard interviews with survivors who said

05:18.000 --> 05:21.000
they hadn't felt an earthquake before the tsunami hit,

05:21.000 --> 05:24.000
so she simply assumed there wasn't one.

05:24.000 --> 05:27.000
A shame she didn't talk to a seismologist who could have told her

05:27.000 --> 05:30.000
that tsunami are often experienced over a much wider area

05:30.000 --> 05:33.000
than the earthquake that causes them.

05:33.000 --> 05:36.000
In 1960, for example, there was a devastating tsunami

05:36.000 --> 05:41.000
that destroyed downtown Hilo in Hawaii and killed 61 people,

05:41.000 --> 05:43.000
but no one felt any tremor.

05:43.000 --> 05:46.000
The same tsunami killed 138 people in Japan,

05:46.000 --> 05:49.000
and again there was no warning tremor.

05:49.000 --> 05:54.000
That's because the earthquake happened in Chile, on the other side of the Pacific.

05:54.000 --> 05:58.000
So while people close to the origins of tsunami do feel an earthquake,

05:58.000 --> 06:01.000
especially if they're standing on soft ground or in tall buildings,

06:01.000 --> 06:04.000
people living far away don't.

06:04.000 --> 06:08.000
But clearly there's no time for the elite team to check any of these facts.

06:08.000 --> 06:10.000
The conspiracy theory has already moved on.

06:10.000 --> 06:13.000
How often are the Northern Lights spotted in Indonesia?

06:13.000 --> 06:17.000
Why would we want to cause a tsunami and kill thousands of Indonesian people?

06:17.000 --> 06:19.000
Alex, maybe they didn't want to.

06:19.000 --> 06:22.000
Maybe they were just experimenting with the thing.

06:22.000 --> 06:25.000
They put it up too high and this was the end result.

06:25.000 --> 06:27.000
What do you think they're going to do after it happens?

06:27.000 --> 06:30.000
Then come out and say, oops, we made a mistake and fess up to it?

06:30.000 --> 06:31.000
Yeah, Alex.

06:31.000 --> 06:33.000
Think about it, they're testing a whole new technology.

06:33.000 --> 06:34.000
But notice what's happened.

06:34.000 --> 06:37.000
In the space of just a few minutes we've jumped from the question of

06:37.000 --> 06:42.000
whether HAARP caused the tsunami to why HAARP caused the tsunami,

06:42.000 --> 06:46.000
even though on the first question we haven't been given one shred of evidence

06:46.000 --> 06:50.000
apart from the fabricated description of a photo that came from a commercial poster company

06:50.000 --> 06:55.000
and June's erroneous assumption about the link between tsunami and seismic tremors.

06:55.000 --> 06:59.000
The science and the evidence, well, they're just nitpicky details.

06:59.000 --> 07:01.000
Fact checking is boring.

07:01.000 --> 07:05.000
Conspiracy theories are all about uncovering the big picture.

07:05.000 --> 07:07.000
From the war room.

07:08.000 --> 07:12.000
Of course, HAARP has now been tied with that other great conspiracy of the 21st century,

07:12.000 --> 07:14.000
so-called chemtrails.

07:14.000 --> 07:18.000
The theory is that the government is spraying something over the skies

07:18.000 --> 07:21.000
and it's doing something to us or the environment.

07:21.000 --> 07:27.000
The problem for me is that chemtrails seem to be completely indistinguishable from contrails,

07:27.000 --> 07:31.000
particles of ice that form from water vapour released by aircraft engines.

07:31.000 --> 07:34.000
Conspiracy theories say they're different.

07:34.000 --> 07:39.000
The chemtrails linger in the atmosphere, whereas contrails don't.

07:39.000 --> 07:42.000
Well, it's a pretty undefined and wussy definition.

07:42.000 --> 07:45.000
But speaking qualitatively, contrails have been doing what they do

07:45.000 --> 07:47.000
ever since planes flew the stratosphere.

07:47.000 --> 07:50.000
Fire and fire into the lifeless stratosphere,

07:50.000 --> 07:55.000
until the exhaust of the engines mixing with the cold thin air condenses

07:55.000 --> 07:58.000
and streams the heavens with paper trails.

07:59.000 --> 08:05.000
But just as I was despairing of finding any evidence that these are anything other than condensation trails,

08:05.000 --> 08:07.000
suddenly I find it.

08:07.000 --> 08:12.000
Secret film from inside the cockpit of one of these chemtrail spraying jets.

08:12.000 --> 08:14.000
What a lucky break.

08:15.000 --> 08:17.000
Well, there you go.

08:17.000 --> 08:21.000
If you're a sceptic, you'll want to know where and when the footage was taken,

08:21.000 --> 08:24.000
why the camera suddenly shifts position from the back of the cockpit

08:24.000 --> 08:27.000
to the lap of whoever's slowly flipping the switch,

08:27.000 --> 08:32.000
and why the word chemtrail has been written on sticky tape and plastered over a switch,

08:32.000 --> 08:36.000
in what any aviator will recognise as the console controlling lighting

08:36.000 --> 08:39.000
for the primary flight and navigation displays.

08:39.000 --> 08:42.000
If you're a conspiracy theorist, this footage will no doubt excite you

08:42.000 --> 08:45.000
with clear evidence of deliberate chemical spraying.

08:45.000 --> 08:49.000
The term conspiracy theory was first coined in the 1960s

08:49.000 --> 08:52.000
to describe a theory that Lee Harvey Oswald didn't act alone

08:52.000 --> 08:55.000
when he assassinated President Kennedy.

08:55.000 --> 09:00.000
It was called a conspiracy to distinguish itself from a one-man operation.

09:00.000 --> 09:05.000
These days, the term is applied to just about anything that may or may not be going on in secret,

09:05.000 --> 09:07.000
which is a pretty broad brush.

09:07.000 --> 09:08.000
Don't forget Watergate.

09:08.000 --> 09:12.000
Yes, OK, look, I'm not denying that things go on in secret,

09:12.000 --> 09:15.000
if that's now the definition of a conspiracy.

09:15.000 --> 09:18.000
But let's take Watergate as a prime example.

09:18.000 --> 09:23.000
It took months of solid investigation to tie President Nixon to the Watergate cover-up.

09:23.000 --> 09:26.000
The Washington Post, where the story was first broken,

09:26.000 --> 09:31.000
insisted on getting every fact checked and confirmed by separate sources.

09:31.000 --> 09:36.000
These days, a conspiracy theory takes as long to prove as it takes to type into a blog.

09:36.000 --> 09:39.000
When the Princess of Wales was killed in 1997,

09:39.000 --> 09:44.000
I went straight to the computer and searched the words Diana and conspiracy,

09:44.000 --> 09:48.000
and on the day of her death, there were already dozens of conspiracy theories

09:48.000 --> 09:50.000
claiming she had been murdered,

09:50.000 --> 09:54.000
based on the fact that the ambulance carrying her travelled very slowly

09:54.000 --> 09:57.000
and it didn't take her to the nearest hospital.

09:57.000 --> 10:02.000
But jumping so quickly to a conspiracy theory leaves no time to answer the question,

10:02.000 --> 10:07.000
why did the ambulance travel so slowly and not go to the nearest hospital?

10:07.000 --> 10:11.000
Of course, there is an explanation, and you'll find it in the video description,

10:11.000 --> 10:14.000
but once a conspiracy theory has been cobbled together

10:14.000 --> 10:20.000
on the basis of whatever sparse information is available in the first few hours, it sticks.

10:20.000 --> 10:25.000
It seems impossible for conspiracy theorists to accept that it was wrong.

10:25.000 --> 10:31.000
Likewise, just hours after thousands of private emails were leaked from the University of East Anglia,

10:31.000 --> 10:36.000
a conspiracy theory had formed before anyone had time to read them all, let alone understand them.

10:36.000 --> 10:43.000
Some of these alleged emails may actually hold the key or actually the clues

10:43.000 --> 10:48.000
to prove that the theory of global warming is a huge conspiracy.

10:48.000 --> 10:53.000
For example, there is one email coming from one scientist,

10:53.000 --> 10:59.000
and in this alleged email, the scientist claims that he had to use additional data

10:59.000 --> 11:03.000
in order to hide the decline of global temperatures.

11:03.000 --> 11:06.000
Of course, that turned out to be complete nonsense,

11:06.000 --> 11:10.000
and we now know the email wasn't claiming anything of the sort.

11:10.000 --> 11:17.000
These hastily drawn conclusions try to adopt the veneer of a real investigation like Watergate the easy way

11:17.000 --> 11:21.000
by simply adding the suffix gate to the conspiracy.

11:21.000 --> 11:24.000
And of course, copy Watergate jargon.

11:25.000 --> 11:27.000
Now of course, in the Watergate investigation,

11:27.000 --> 11:32.000
follow the money meant trace the source of the money paid to the Watergate burglars.

11:32.000 --> 11:37.000
By backtracking checks and funds, the trail led to the committee to re-elect the president,

11:37.000 --> 11:41.000
and it gave reporters Woodward and Bernstein the evidence they needed

11:41.000 --> 11:44.000
to show a link between the burglars and the White House.

11:44.000 --> 11:49.000
Conspiracy theorists have stuck the phrase to their own brand of investigative reporting,

11:49.000 --> 11:54.000
which is to simply show that money paid to researchers comes from research grants.

11:54.000 --> 11:56.000
Wow, well done!

11:56.000 --> 12:02.000
This astonishing discovery can be applied to, well, just about anyone engaged in scientific research.

12:02.000 --> 12:08.000
The implication is that researchers will discover whatever the government wants them to discover.

12:08.000 --> 12:12.000
Well, there are a few things I don't get about this conspiracy theory.

12:12.000 --> 12:15.000
Scientists doing basic research are the cream of their profession,

12:15.000 --> 12:19.000
PhDs who could command high salaries if they worked in industry.

12:19.000 --> 12:23.000
They don't get paid much for working in university research.

12:23.000 --> 12:27.000
In my experience, they do it because they love discovering new things,

12:27.000 --> 12:32.000
and for most of them, a goal is to make a groundbreaking discovery and perhaps win a Nobel Prize.

12:32.000 --> 12:39.000
Well, you're not going to do that by fabricating your data in order to get the same results as everyone else.

12:39.000 --> 12:42.000
Fabricating results means you risk getting kicked out of your job

12:42.000 --> 12:45.000
and losing all credibility in your profession.

12:45.000 --> 12:51.000
The accolades in science go to overturning the conventional wisdom, not confirming it.

12:51.000 --> 12:56.000
And in the case of climate research, where the mantra follow the money is most often applied,

12:56.000 --> 12:59.000
if climate researchers are faking their results to please the government,

12:59.000 --> 13:05.000
why didn't American scientists under George Bush Sr. and Canadian scientists under the current government

13:05.000 --> 13:10.000
start pouring out papers showing there's no link between CO2 and global temperature?

13:10.000 --> 13:15.000
After all, both administrations were and are hostile to action on climate change

13:15.000 --> 13:19.000
and would love to get supporting evidence from the scientific community.

13:19.000 --> 13:22.000
But if this makes no sense to you, then there's another theory to explain

13:22.000 --> 13:26.000
why the research continues to show a link between CO2 and global temperatures.

13:26.000 --> 13:31.000
Apparently, climate scientists want to install a world Marxist government run by the UN.

13:31.000 --> 13:36.000
You know, the New World Order. And climate scientists aren't the only ones.

13:36.000 --> 13:40.000
Evolution is also the foundation philosophy for the New World Order.

13:40.000 --> 13:43.000
Evil men have already divided up the world into regions,

13:43.000 --> 13:46.000
and they've got it all planned. They want to rule the world.

13:46.000 --> 13:49.000
Their goal is to reduce the population to a half billion,

13:49.000 --> 13:53.000
with a few of them as the elite get to rule the world.

13:53.000 --> 13:57.000
Of course, a conspiracy theory is never ever wrong.

13:57.000 --> 14:02.000
So when real evidence comes along to dispute it, the only way out is to claim fraud.

14:02.000 --> 14:05.000
And if the evidence has been confirmed by other researchers,

14:05.000 --> 14:08.000
then they must be in on the conspiracy too.

14:08.000 --> 14:10.000
And if their research has been peer reviewed,

14:10.000 --> 14:13.000
then the peer reviewers must be part of the conspiracy

14:13.000 --> 14:16.000
and the scientific journals that publish the research papers.

14:16.000 --> 14:20.000
And if public inquiries find no evidence of fraud or fabrication,

14:20.000 --> 14:24.000
then of course they must all be in on the conspiracy.

14:24.000 --> 14:27.000
That's why a conspiracy theory can never ever be wrong.

14:27.000 --> 14:31.000
The number of conspirators simply expands to accommodate it.

14:31.000 --> 14:33.000
If you want to study some of the conspiracies, if you get into that kind of stuff,

14:33.000 --> 14:35.000
there have been numerous conspiracies.

14:35.000 --> 14:37.000
Get the Medusa file, or the American conspiracy,

14:37.000 --> 14:41.000
New American magazine, the conspiracy, to see what's really happening.

14:41.000 --> 14:43.000
Many folks are convinced the government was involved

14:43.000 --> 14:46.000
in taking down the building in Oklahoma City.

14:46.000 --> 14:49.000
And same thing with the Twin Tower bombing.

14:49.000 --> 14:52.000
Where were all the other security cameras aimed?

14:52.000 --> 14:57.000
We were sent some photographs that were taken apparently right after the event.

14:57.000 --> 15:00.000
We also had a report about a gas station

15:00.000 --> 15:03.000
whose video camera was pointed in the exact direction

15:03.000 --> 15:06.000
where the 757 would have hit the Pentagon.

15:06.000 --> 15:11.000
Shortly after the event, it was reported that federal officials

15:11.000 --> 15:14.000
showed up at that gas station and confiscated that footage.

15:14.000 --> 15:19.000
If someone like Pothola54 were to do a 9-11 conspiracy debunk video

15:19.000 --> 15:22.000
as convincingly as he did at debunking ancient aliens,

15:22.000 --> 15:25.000
I would be forced to pause and reconsider.

15:25.000 --> 15:28.000
Thanks, I'm flattered, but why should I debunk this

15:28.000 --> 15:32.000
when I'm sure you're perfectly capable of debunking it yourself?

15:32.000 --> 15:36.000
As I've said before, I'm not doing anything brilliant or extraordinary in my videos,

15:36.000 --> 15:41.000
simply verifying claims by checking sources, which anyone can do.

15:41.000 --> 15:44.000
If you watch any of the videos or you've been unfortunate enough

15:44.000 --> 15:48.000
to be cornered by one of these 9-11 conspiracy theorists at a party

15:48.000 --> 15:53.000
and have had your ear chewed off for over an hour about all the evidence,

15:53.000 --> 15:57.000
you'll know that it's all based on quotes from people who believe they heard a bomb,

15:57.000 --> 15:59.000
people who believe they saw a missile,

15:59.000 --> 16:03.000
people who feel there's something in one of the photos or missing from the photos,

16:03.000 --> 16:07.000
or who feel that buildings and airlines shouldn't have acted the way they did.

16:07.000 --> 16:11.000
Conspiracy theorists insist that all these unsourced reports

16:11.000 --> 16:16.000
and assumptions and speculation raise questions, to which I say, great.

16:16.000 --> 16:19.000
Then do what real investigative reporters do,

16:19.000 --> 16:22.000
put your coat on and go and find the answers.

16:22.000 --> 16:26.000
Real conspiracies have been uncovered by answering questions,

16:26.000 --> 16:31.000
not by sitting in front of a computer screen and wondering why something looks or feels wrong.

16:31.000 --> 16:34.000
Just say, hey, no smoking in here, what do you want?

16:34.000 --> 16:38.000
You know, I'm about to talk about this whole, you know, microchipping.

16:38.000 --> 16:40.000
Microchipping? What?

16:40.000 --> 16:41.000
Obamacare and...

16:41.000 --> 16:43.000
OK, can you go away and put a shirt on?

16:43.000 --> 16:47.000
Here's one of the websites that got the shirtless smoker so agitated.

16:47.000 --> 16:50.000
It's about a microchip, widely reported in the media,

16:50.000 --> 16:55.000
that can hold important health data on individuals who suffer from debilitating illness.

16:55.000 --> 17:01.000
But nowhere does it give any evidence that Americans will be forcibly implanted with microchips,

17:01.000 --> 17:07.000
and on the basis of this essay filled with rumour and belief, the shirtless smoker believes it too.

17:07.000 --> 17:11.000
And so does the preacher who's about to go, what?

17:11.000 --> 17:17.000
What? Are we talking about a microchip that they want to put in your hand?

17:19.000 --> 17:23.000
Folks, it's already the law of the land. It was passed in the Obamacare bill.

17:24.000 --> 17:28.000
It was? Does anyone have the relevant passage in the bill?

17:28.000 --> 17:31.000
Yes, this is the passage they all refer to.

17:31.000 --> 17:35.000
But of course it doesn't say that all Americans have to be microchipped at all.

17:35.000 --> 17:41.000
It mandates the establishment of a national registry of people who have implantable devices,

17:41.000 --> 17:44.000
such as pacemakers, to monitor safety and outcomes.

17:44.000 --> 17:48.000
But so certain are the conspiracy theorists that they must be right

17:48.000 --> 17:52.000
that they even put a date by which all Americans would be forcibly microchipped.

17:52.000 --> 17:55.000
March 23rd, 2013.

17:55.000 --> 17:57.000
Whoops.

17:57.000 --> 18:00.000
But let's bring all this bang up to date.

18:00.000 --> 18:06.000
I had a small bet with myself that even the Boston Marathon bombing would by now have spawned its own conspiracy,

18:06.000 --> 18:08.000
and sure enough it has.

18:08.000 --> 18:12.000
It comes courtesy of the Russian government's channel Russia Today,

18:12.000 --> 18:16.000
and we know how reliable they are when it comes to checking facts.

18:16.000 --> 18:21.000
These days you'll find a conspiracy theory surrounding any event almost as soon as it happens,

18:21.000 --> 18:25.000
and if you're not convinced by the sparse and speculative evidence provided,

18:25.000 --> 18:29.000
the conspiracy theorist will resort to a common fallback position.

18:29.000 --> 18:32.000
You don't think this is possible? Seriously?

18:32.000 --> 18:36.000
You trust the government? You think big business is working in your interests?

18:36.000 --> 18:40.000
Well, yeah, conspiracies exist. Come on.

18:40.000 --> 18:43.000
Yes, they do. But murders also exist.

18:43.000 --> 18:47.000
It doesn't mean everyone who comes to your door is a murderer.

18:47.000 --> 18:49.000
Do I trust the government? No.

18:49.000 --> 18:56.000
The difference between you and me is that I don't trust the information I see in internet blogs or videos either.

18:56.000 --> 18:59.000
I look for their sources, if they have any, and check them.

18:59.000 --> 19:06.000
Unlike you, I want to know the answers to questions, not treat questions as if they were answers.

19:06.000 --> 19:09.000
Unlike you, I don't swallow unverified claims,

19:09.000 --> 19:15.000
or form instant conclusions based on nothing more than hearsay, feelings, beliefs, ifs and maybes.

19:15.000 --> 19:19.000
That doesn't make me smarter than you or any better educated,

19:19.000 --> 19:23.000
but it does mean I'm more sceptical and far less gullible.

19:23.000 --> 19:32.000
We all know it wasn't something that happened 20 years ago, but now it's happening now.
