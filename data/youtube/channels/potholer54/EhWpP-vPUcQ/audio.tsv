0	4000	I'm just wondering what the heck is in our water supply.
4000	9000	What the heck is in our oxygen supply of the metallic
9000	15000	oxide salts that create a rainbow effect in a sprinkler?
15000	20000	What is oozing out of our ground that allows this
20000	23000	type of effect to happen?
23000	26000	Not just around our sun and our moon anymore.
26000	35000	Everywhere we look, the visible spectrum is rainbows.
35000	37000	This cannot be natural.
37000	40000	If proof was ever needed of a government conspiracy,
40000	43000	then this rainbow in a sprinkler is surely it.
43000	46000	After all, the authorities claim they're spending money
46000	49000	on science education in schools, but this video shows
49000	52000	that in fact the government is conspiring to suck
52000	55000	the intelligence out of people who should have at least
55000	58000	got a basic understanding of science in elementary school.
58000	61000	The title at the opening of this creepy sprinkler video
61000	64000	gives an alternative explanation.
64000	67000	Rainbows are caused by something called HAARP.
67000	70000	It's basically a phased array radar that sends up to
70000	74000	3.6 megawatts of electromagnetic radiation into the ionosphere,
74000	77000	which heats it up over a narrow range.
77000	80000	What makes this a godsend for conspiracy theorists
80000	83000	is that the research may have a military application.
83000	86000	The theory is that by sending radio waves through the ionosphere,
86000	90000	what gets bounced back will be longer wavelength radiation
90000	93000	that can act like ground-penetrating radar.
93000	97000	But the fact that it's a secret installation run by the military
97000	100000	sending invisible beams into space and then into the Earth,
100000	104000	well, that's enough to excite any conspiracy theorist.
104000	109000	Now, the top secret government project that can destroy the world.
109000	113000	So every pet conspiracy theory from hurricanes to mind control,
113000	116000	and of course rainbow after rainbow after rainbow,
116000	119000	has now been attacked to HAARP.
119000	122000	Back at his war room, the governor meets with his elite team
122000	125000	of investigators, researchers and operatives,
125000	127000	all of them itching to get on the case.
127000	130000	Here's Jesse Ventura investigating HAARP's triggering
130000	135000	of the 2010 Boxing Day tsunami that hit large parts of South East Asia.
135000	138000	This photo was actually taken just before the big tsunami
138000	140000	hit the coast of Indonesia.
140000	143000	What we're seeing is the aurora borealis or the northern lights.
143000	146000	They occur anytime there's any sort of electromagnetic occurrence
146000	149000	in the ionosphere, and they say that when they turn HAARP on,
149000	151000	the colours get really wild up there.
151000	156000	There's no need for dramatic music or speculation about secret conspiracies.
156000	159000	Researchers working at HAARP are quite open about the fact that HAARP
159000	162000	does excite charged particles in the upper atmosphere,
162000	164000	and that produces colours in the sky.
164000	167000	You can even read about these experiments in published papers,
167000	170000	where the physics is explained.
170000	174000	But portraying this as some kind of discovery allows Jesse Ventura
174000	177000	to enter the wild world of speculation,
177000	180000	and wonder what else HAARP might be secretly doing.
180000	185000	His elite investigator, Rahim, tells us this photo of the aurora borealis
185000	190000	is evidence of a link between HAARP and the tsunami of Boxing Day 2010,
190000	193000	because the photo was taken just before the tsunami struck.
193000	198000	This photo was actually taken just before the big tsunami hit the coast of Indonesia.
198000	202000	When exactly? We don't know. Who took it? Don't know that either.
202000	206000	So how do we know it was taken just before the tsunami?
206000	210000	Of course, conspiracy theorists will tell me I'm naive to be so sceptical.
210000	214000	Why am I so resistant to the idea that this aurora happened
214000	217000	when Jesse Ventura's investigation says it happened,
217000	220000	and that it has some connection to the tsunami?
220000	222000	Well, I'll tell you why.
222000	227000	Because before I'm gullible enough to believe some spectacular claim I hear on TV,
227000	229000	I have the sense to check it,
229000	234000	and in this case it meant taking the conspiracy show logo off the bottom of the photo
234000	237000	and doing a search for it on Google Images.
237000	242000	And presto, I discovered exactly the same photo on sale for $24
242000	245000	at Dave Miller's Posters Wanted website.
245000	249000	Not only is there no indication that this commercial picture was taken before,
249000	254000	or even in the same decade as the tsunami, it's not even in the same hemisphere.
254000	259000	Rahim says this is the Aurora Borealis, the Northern Lights.
259000	264000	In fact, it's advertised as the Aurora Australis, the Southern Lights.
264000	268000	So the photo that's supposed to show how a military death machine was activated
268000	273000	just before a major earthquake has in fact been lifted off the internet for $24
273000	277000	by Jesse Ventura's team of elite investigators.
277000	280000	The other thing that's interesting before the tsunami
280000	284000	was that there were no pre-tremors or any warning. It just happened.
284000	286000	Now, I'm not an elite investigator,
286000	291000	and I don't have the resources of Jesse Ventura's elite investigation team,
291000	295000	but it took me just a few minutes to check this claim that the tsunami just happened
295000	298000	and wasn't preceded by an earthquake.
298000	303000	Here, for example, is a seismological record of the supposedly non-existent earthquake,
303000	307000	and here are some scientific papers detailing the mechanism of the earthquake.
307000	311000	So where did elite investigator June Sarpong go wrong,
311000	315000	apart from not checking publicly available records?
315000	318000	I think she probably heard interviews with survivors who said
318000	321000	they hadn't felt an earthquake before the tsunami hit,
321000	324000	so she simply assumed there wasn't one.
324000	327000	A shame she didn't talk to a seismologist who could have told her
327000	330000	that tsunami are often experienced over a much wider area
330000	333000	than the earthquake that causes them.
333000	336000	In 1960, for example, there was a devastating tsunami
336000	341000	that destroyed downtown Hilo in Hawaii and killed 61 people,
341000	343000	but no one felt any tremor.
343000	346000	The same tsunami killed 138 people in Japan,
346000	349000	and again there was no warning tremor.
349000	354000	That's because the earthquake happened in Chile, on the other side of the Pacific.
354000	358000	So while people close to the origins of tsunami do feel an earthquake,
358000	361000	especially if they're standing on soft ground or in tall buildings,
361000	364000	people living far away don't.
364000	368000	But clearly there's no time for the elite team to check any of these facts.
368000	370000	The conspiracy theory has already moved on.
370000	373000	How often are the Northern Lights spotted in Indonesia?
373000	377000	Why would we want to cause a tsunami and kill thousands of Indonesian people?
377000	379000	Alex, maybe they didn't want to.
379000	382000	Maybe they were just experimenting with the thing.
382000	385000	They put it up too high and this was the end result.
385000	387000	What do you think they're going to do after it happens?
387000	390000	Then come out and say, oops, we made a mistake and fess up to it?
390000	391000	Yeah, Alex.
391000	393000	Think about it, they're testing a whole new technology.
393000	394000	But notice what's happened.
394000	397000	In the space of just a few minutes we've jumped from the question of
397000	402000	whether HAARP caused the tsunami to why HAARP caused the tsunami,
402000	406000	even though on the first question we haven't been given one shred of evidence
406000	410000	apart from the fabricated description of a photo that came from a commercial poster company
410000	415000	and June's erroneous assumption about the link between tsunami and seismic tremors.
415000	419000	The science and the evidence, well, they're just nitpicky details.
419000	421000	Fact checking is boring.
421000	425000	Conspiracy theories are all about uncovering the big picture.
425000	427000	From the war room.
428000	432000	Of course, HAARP has now been tied with that other great conspiracy of the 21st century,
432000	434000	so-called chemtrails.
434000	438000	The theory is that the government is spraying something over the skies
438000	441000	and it's doing something to us or the environment.
441000	447000	The problem for me is that chemtrails seem to be completely indistinguishable from contrails,
447000	451000	particles of ice that form from water vapour released by aircraft engines.
451000	454000	Conspiracy theories say they're different.
454000	459000	The chemtrails linger in the atmosphere, whereas contrails don't.
459000	462000	Well, it's a pretty undefined and wussy definition.
462000	465000	But speaking qualitatively, contrails have been doing what they do
465000	467000	ever since planes flew the stratosphere.
467000	470000	Fire and fire into the lifeless stratosphere,
470000	475000	until the exhaust of the engines mixing with the cold thin air condenses
475000	478000	and streams the heavens with paper trails.
479000	485000	But just as I was despairing of finding any evidence that these are anything other than condensation trails,
485000	487000	suddenly I find it.
487000	492000	Secret film from inside the cockpit of one of these chemtrail spraying jets.
492000	494000	What a lucky break.
495000	497000	Well, there you go.
497000	501000	If you're a sceptic, you'll want to know where and when the footage was taken,
501000	504000	why the camera suddenly shifts position from the back of the cockpit
504000	507000	to the lap of whoever's slowly flipping the switch,
507000	512000	and why the word chemtrail has been written on sticky tape and plastered over a switch,
512000	516000	in what any aviator will recognise as the console controlling lighting
516000	519000	for the primary flight and navigation displays.
519000	522000	If you're a conspiracy theorist, this footage will no doubt excite you
522000	525000	with clear evidence of deliberate chemical spraying.
525000	529000	The term conspiracy theory was first coined in the 1960s
529000	532000	to describe a theory that Lee Harvey Oswald didn't act alone
532000	535000	when he assassinated President Kennedy.
535000	540000	It was called a conspiracy to distinguish itself from a one-man operation.
540000	545000	These days, the term is applied to just about anything that may or may not be going on in secret,
545000	547000	which is a pretty broad brush.
547000	548000	Don't forget Watergate.
548000	552000	Yes, OK, look, I'm not denying that things go on in secret,
552000	555000	if that's now the definition of a conspiracy.
555000	558000	But let's take Watergate as a prime example.
558000	563000	It took months of solid investigation to tie President Nixon to the Watergate cover-up.
563000	566000	The Washington Post, where the story was first broken,
566000	571000	insisted on getting every fact checked and confirmed by separate sources.
571000	576000	These days, a conspiracy theory takes as long to prove as it takes to type into a blog.
576000	579000	When the Princess of Wales was killed in 1997,
579000	584000	I went straight to the computer and searched the words Diana and conspiracy,
584000	588000	and on the day of her death, there were already dozens of conspiracy theories
588000	590000	claiming she had been murdered,
590000	594000	based on the fact that the ambulance carrying her travelled very slowly
594000	597000	and it didn't take her to the nearest hospital.
597000	602000	But jumping so quickly to a conspiracy theory leaves no time to answer the question,
602000	607000	why did the ambulance travel so slowly and not go to the nearest hospital?
607000	611000	Of course, there is an explanation, and you'll find it in the video description,
611000	614000	but once a conspiracy theory has been cobbled together
614000	620000	on the basis of whatever sparse information is available in the first few hours, it sticks.
620000	625000	It seems impossible for conspiracy theorists to accept that it was wrong.
625000	631000	Likewise, just hours after thousands of private emails were leaked from the University of East Anglia,
631000	636000	a conspiracy theory had formed before anyone had time to read them all, let alone understand them.
636000	643000	Some of these alleged emails may actually hold the key or actually the clues
643000	648000	to prove that the theory of global warming is a huge conspiracy.
648000	653000	For example, there is one email coming from one scientist,
653000	659000	and in this alleged email, the scientist claims that he had to use additional data
659000	663000	in order to hide the decline of global temperatures.
663000	666000	Of course, that turned out to be complete nonsense,
666000	670000	and we now know the email wasn't claiming anything of the sort.
670000	677000	These hastily drawn conclusions try to adopt the veneer of a real investigation like Watergate the easy way
677000	681000	by simply adding the suffix gate to the conspiracy.
681000	684000	And of course, copy Watergate jargon.
685000	687000	Now of course, in the Watergate investigation,
687000	692000	follow the money meant trace the source of the money paid to the Watergate burglars.
692000	697000	By backtracking checks and funds, the trail led to the committee to re-elect the president,
697000	701000	and it gave reporters Woodward and Bernstein the evidence they needed
701000	704000	to show a link between the burglars and the White House.
704000	709000	Conspiracy theorists have stuck the phrase to their own brand of investigative reporting,
709000	714000	which is to simply show that money paid to researchers comes from research grants.
714000	716000	Wow, well done!
716000	722000	This astonishing discovery can be applied to, well, just about anyone engaged in scientific research.
722000	728000	The implication is that researchers will discover whatever the government wants them to discover.
728000	732000	Well, there are a few things I don't get about this conspiracy theory.
732000	735000	Scientists doing basic research are the cream of their profession,
735000	739000	PhDs who could command high salaries if they worked in industry.
739000	743000	They don't get paid much for working in university research.
743000	747000	In my experience, they do it because they love discovering new things,
747000	752000	and for most of them, a goal is to make a groundbreaking discovery and perhaps win a Nobel Prize.
752000	759000	Well, you're not going to do that by fabricating your data in order to get the same results as everyone else.
759000	762000	Fabricating results means you risk getting kicked out of your job
762000	765000	and losing all credibility in your profession.
765000	771000	The accolades in science go to overturning the conventional wisdom, not confirming it.
771000	776000	And in the case of climate research, where the mantra follow the money is most often applied,
776000	779000	if climate researchers are faking their results to please the government,
779000	785000	why didn't American scientists under George Bush Sr. and Canadian scientists under the current government
785000	790000	start pouring out papers showing there's no link between CO2 and global temperature?
790000	795000	After all, both administrations were and are hostile to action on climate change
795000	799000	and would love to get supporting evidence from the scientific community.
799000	802000	But if this makes no sense to you, then there's another theory to explain
802000	806000	why the research continues to show a link between CO2 and global temperatures.
806000	811000	Apparently, climate scientists want to install a world Marxist government run by the UN.
811000	816000	You know, the New World Order. And climate scientists aren't the only ones.
816000	820000	Evolution is also the foundation philosophy for the New World Order.
820000	823000	Evil men have already divided up the world into regions,
823000	826000	and they've got it all planned. They want to rule the world.
826000	829000	Their goal is to reduce the population to a half billion,
829000	833000	with a few of them as the elite get to rule the world.
833000	837000	Of course, a conspiracy theory is never ever wrong.
837000	842000	So when real evidence comes along to dispute it, the only way out is to claim fraud.
842000	845000	And if the evidence has been confirmed by other researchers,
845000	848000	then they must be in on the conspiracy too.
848000	850000	And if their research has been peer reviewed,
850000	853000	then the peer reviewers must be part of the conspiracy
853000	856000	and the scientific journals that publish the research papers.
856000	860000	And if public inquiries find no evidence of fraud or fabrication,
860000	864000	then of course they must all be in on the conspiracy.
864000	867000	That's why a conspiracy theory can never ever be wrong.
867000	871000	The number of conspirators simply expands to accommodate it.
871000	873000	If you want to study some of the conspiracies, if you get into that kind of stuff,
873000	875000	there have been numerous conspiracies.
875000	877000	Get the Medusa file, or the American conspiracy,
877000	881000	New American magazine, the conspiracy, to see what's really happening.
881000	883000	Many folks are convinced the government was involved
883000	886000	in taking down the building in Oklahoma City.
886000	889000	And same thing with the Twin Tower bombing.
889000	892000	Where were all the other security cameras aimed?
892000	897000	We were sent some photographs that were taken apparently right after the event.
897000	900000	We also had a report about a gas station
900000	903000	whose video camera was pointed in the exact direction
903000	906000	where the 757 would have hit the Pentagon.
906000	911000	Shortly after the event, it was reported that federal officials
911000	914000	showed up at that gas station and confiscated that footage.
914000	919000	If someone like Pothola54 were to do a 9-11 conspiracy debunk video
919000	922000	as convincingly as he did at debunking ancient aliens,
922000	925000	I would be forced to pause and reconsider.
925000	928000	Thanks, I'm flattered, but why should I debunk this
928000	932000	when I'm sure you're perfectly capable of debunking it yourself?
932000	936000	As I've said before, I'm not doing anything brilliant or extraordinary in my videos,
936000	941000	simply verifying claims by checking sources, which anyone can do.
941000	944000	If you watch any of the videos or you've been unfortunate enough
944000	948000	to be cornered by one of these 9-11 conspiracy theorists at a party
948000	953000	and have had your ear chewed off for over an hour about all the evidence,
953000	957000	you'll know that it's all based on quotes from people who believe they heard a bomb,
957000	959000	people who believe they saw a missile,
959000	963000	people who feel there's something in one of the photos or missing from the photos,
963000	967000	or who feel that buildings and airlines shouldn't have acted the way they did.
967000	971000	Conspiracy theorists insist that all these unsourced reports
971000	976000	and assumptions and speculation raise questions, to which I say, great.
976000	979000	Then do what real investigative reporters do,
979000	982000	put your coat on and go and find the answers.
982000	986000	Real conspiracies have been uncovered by answering questions,
986000	991000	not by sitting in front of a computer screen and wondering why something looks or feels wrong.
991000	994000	Just say, hey, no smoking in here, what do you want?
994000	998000	You know, I'm about to talk about this whole, you know, microchipping.
998000	1000000	Microchipping? What?
1000000	1001000	Obamacare and...
1001000	1003000	OK, can you go away and put a shirt on?
1003000	1007000	Here's one of the websites that got the shirtless smoker so agitated.
1007000	1010000	It's about a microchip, widely reported in the media,
1010000	1015000	that can hold important health data on individuals who suffer from debilitating illness.
1015000	1021000	But nowhere does it give any evidence that Americans will be forcibly implanted with microchips,
1021000	1027000	and on the basis of this essay filled with rumour and belief, the shirtless smoker believes it too.
1027000	1031000	And so does the preacher who's about to go, what?
1031000	1037000	What? Are we talking about a microchip that they want to put in your hand?
1039000	1043000	Folks, it's already the law of the land. It was passed in the Obamacare bill.
1044000	1048000	It was? Does anyone have the relevant passage in the bill?
1048000	1051000	Yes, this is the passage they all refer to.
1051000	1055000	But of course it doesn't say that all Americans have to be microchipped at all.
1055000	1061000	It mandates the establishment of a national registry of people who have implantable devices,
1061000	1064000	such as pacemakers, to monitor safety and outcomes.
1064000	1068000	But so certain are the conspiracy theorists that they must be right
1068000	1072000	that they even put a date by which all Americans would be forcibly microchipped.
1072000	1075000	March 23rd, 2013.
1075000	1077000	Whoops.
1077000	1080000	But let's bring all this bang up to date.
1080000	1086000	I had a small bet with myself that even the Boston Marathon bombing would by now have spawned its own conspiracy,
1086000	1088000	and sure enough it has.
1088000	1092000	It comes courtesy of the Russian government's channel Russia Today,
1092000	1096000	and we know how reliable they are when it comes to checking facts.
1096000	1101000	These days you'll find a conspiracy theory surrounding any event almost as soon as it happens,
1101000	1105000	and if you're not convinced by the sparse and speculative evidence provided,
1105000	1109000	the conspiracy theorist will resort to a common fallback position.
1109000	1112000	You don't think this is possible? Seriously?
1112000	1116000	You trust the government? You think big business is working in your interests?
1116000	1120000	Well, yeah, conspiracies exist. Come on.
1120000	1123000	Yes, they do. But murders also exist.
1123000	1127000	It doesn't mean everyone who comes to your door is a murderer.
1127000	1129000	Do I trust the government? No.
1129000	1136000	The difference between you and me is that I don't trust the information I see in internet blogs or videos either.
1136000	1139000	I look for their sources, if they have any, and check them.
1139000	1146000	Unlike you, I want to know the answers to questions, not treat questions as if they were answers.
1146000	1149000	Unlike you, I don't swallow unverified claims,
1149000	1155000	or form instant conclusions based on nothing more than hearsay, feelings, beliefs, ifs and maybes.
1155000	1159000	That doesn't make me smarter than you or any better educated,
1159000	1163000	but it does mean I'm more sceptical and far less gullible.
1163000	1172000	We all know it wasn't something that happened 20 years ago, but now it's happening now.
