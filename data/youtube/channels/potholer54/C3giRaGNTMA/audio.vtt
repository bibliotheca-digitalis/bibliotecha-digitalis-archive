00:00.000 --> 00:03.600
It's a favourite tactic of anyone who wants to undermine science,

00:03.600 --> 00:06.920
compile a list of quotes usually from scientists

00:06.920 --> 00:11.000
and usually taken out of context. Monckton does this of course

00:11.000 --> 00:15.120
but he also goes a step further. If he doesn't think the quote is convincing

00:15.120 --> 00:15.600
enough

00:15.600 --> 00:19.400
he'll simply change it. One of the climate gate conspirators here

00:19.400 --> 00:24.600
talking privately says there has been no global warming for a decade we cannot

00:24.600 --> 00:25.880
explain why

00:25.880 --> 00:31.340
it is a travesty that we can't. The first thing to be suspicious of if someone

00:31.340 --> 00:32.640
throws a quote at you

00:32.640 --> 00:37.240
is the lack of a source and very few Monckton quotes are properly sourced

00:37.240 --> 00:41.060
which of course makes it harder to see whether they're real or imaginary.

00:41.060 --> 00:44.480
Climate gate for example isn't a source

00:44.480 --> 00:48.780
a date and an email reference would be a source but this one is fairly easy to

00:48.780 --> 00:49.580
track down

00:49.580 --> 00:53.360
because the East Anglia University emails are all listed on the net

00:53.480 --> 00:57.920
and there's a search engine to locate particular emails and this is the famous

00:57.920 --> 01:00.520
one from Trenberth that Monckton is referring to.

01:00.520 --> 01:05.120
The exact quote is the fact is that we can't account for the lack of warming at

01:05.120 --> 01:05.640
the moment

01:05.640 --> 01:09.920
and it's a travesty that we can't. Now if this means the same thing

01:09.920 --> 01:14.560
then why change it? Trenberth of course was referring to the energy budget.

01:14.560 --> 01:17.740
Monckton thinks he should have been saying something more akin to a key

01:17.740 --> 01:18.800
Monckton argument

01:18.800 --> 01:22.400
about the lack of global warming for a decade so presto

01:22.440 --> 01:26.880
Monckton changes the quote to make it comply. Of course it now means something

01:26.880 --> 01:27.720
very different.

01:27.720 --> 01:30.800
If you want to argue that it doesn't change the meaning at all

01:30.800 --> 01:34.840
and it still means exactly the same thing then why change it?

01:34.840 --> 01:39.240
Why not tell us what Trenberth actually wrote and let us make up our own minds

01:39.240 --> 01:40.240
about the meaning?

01:40.240 --> 01:44.240
This is a question I want you to bear in mind as we go through a list of other

01:44.240 --> 01:45.600
fabricated quotes.

01:45.600 --> 01:50.620
If this was an isolated case it could be regarded as a sloppy error

01:51.060 --> 01:54.900
but it's part of a pattern of carefully changed and rearranged quotes

01:54.900 --> 01:58.180
that pepper Monckton's presentations. Here's another one.

01:58.180 --> 02:03.400
He said the Argeddon scenario that he depicts is not based on any

02:03.400 --> 02:04.460
scientific

02:04.460 --> 02:08.060
view. This is supposed to be a quote from Justice Burton

02:08.060 --> 02:12.140
the judge who ruled on the use of Al Gore's film An Inconvenient Truth

02:12.140 --> 02:16.260
in British schools. I was skeptical of this as soon as I heard it

02:16.260 --> 02:20.220
because I was aware of the court case and this quote just didn't seem to fit

02:20.260 --> 02:24.660
the judge's final ruling. So I checked a transcript of the summing up.

02:24.660 --> 02:28.660
No surprise, Monckton had changed it. This is what the judge

02:28.660 --> 02:33.460
actually said. It is common ground that if indeed Greenland melted it would

02:33.460 --> 02:35.180
release this amount of water

02:35.180 --> 02:40.620
but only after and over millennia so that the Armageddon scenario he predicts

02:40.620 --> 02:45.140
in so far as it suggests that sea level rises of seven metres might occur in the

02:45.140 --> 02:46.340
immediate future

02:46.340 --> 02:50.500
is not in line with the scientific consensus. It's interesting to see what

02:50.500 --> 02:52.540
Monckton doesn't like in a quote.

02:52.540 --> 02:56.220
Monckton always questions whether there's a consensus on climate change

02:56.220 --> 02:59.840
so he changes not in line with the scientific consensus

02:59.840 --> 03:04.980
to not based on any scientific view. Now in his speech and this slide Monckton

03:04.980 --> 03:08.900
does preface this misquote by pointing out the judge was referring to Gore's

03:08.900 --> 03:11.060
claim of a 20-foot sea level rise

03:11.060 --> 03:15.540
but that's not always the case. According to an interview with Climate Depot in

03:15.540 --> 03:16.700
2009

03:16.700 --> 03:20.460
Monckton said the judge was referring to Gore's entire movie

03:20.460 --> 03:27.060
and this has inevitably been copied and pasted all over the internet.

03:27.060 --> 03:31.980
Now I'm no fan of Al Gore's film. I've criticized it myself in an earlier video

03:31.980 --> 03:35.220
and I agree with Monckton that it shouldn't be shown in schools

03:35.220 --> 03:38.420
but I didn't need to misrepresent what the judge said

03:38.420 --> 03:42.540
in order to rebut Gore's film. I just needed to state the facts.

03:43.380 --> 03:46.940
An appalling admission which was compounded by an admission on the part

03:46.940 --> 03:48.900
of the lead author of the subchapter in question

03:48.900 --> 03:52.140
that he knew that figure was wrong but had left it in anyway

03:52.140 --> 03:55.980
because he knew that the intergovernmental panel on climate change

03:55.980 --> 03:59.180
wanted to influence governments and politicians.

03:59.180 --> 04:02.580
So in other words once again an admission they were going to lie.

04:02.580 --> 04:06.700
Monckton is referring to Dr. Murari Lal who wrote the report on Himalayan

04:06.700 --> 04:08.580
glaciers for the IPCC.

04:08.980 --> 04:12.900
The now famous catalogue of errors began when New Scientist interviewed

04:12.900 --> 04:14.180
Said Haznain

04:14.180 --> 04:18.700
lead author of a four-year study by the International Commission on Snow and Ice.

04:18.700 --> 04:23.340
According to New Scientist Haznain's four-year study indicates that all the

04:23.340 --> 04:25.740
glaciers in the central and eastern Himalayas

04:25.740 --> 04:29.900
could disappear by 2035 at their present rate of decline.

04:29.900 --> 04:33.540
New Scientist is now calling it a speculative comment

04:33.540 --> 04:36.580
but it wasn't reported as a speculative comment

04:36.780 --> 04:40.340
it was reported as the conclusion of a four-year study.

04:40.340 --> 04:43.700
The World Wide Fund for Nature picked it up and Lal

04:43.700 --> 04:48.780
incredible as it may sound got his information from the WWF.

04:48.780 --> 04:52.580
In the Mail on Sunday story David Rose quoted Lal as saying

04:52.580 --> 04:56.340
we knew the WWF report with the 2035 date was

04:56.340 --> 05:01.180
grey literature which means material not published in a peer-reviewed journal

05:01.180 --> 05:04.580
but it was never picked up by any of the authors in our working group

05:04.580 --> 05:07.620
nor by any of the more than 500 external reviewers

05:07.620 --> 05:12.580
by the governments to which it was sent or by the final IPCC review editors.

05:12.580 --> 05:17.660
Moncton turned Lal's statement that he knew the 2035 figure wasn't peer-reviewed

05:17.660 --> 05:21.060
into an admission by Lal that he knew the figure was wrong

05:21.060 --> 05:24.180
but not even the Mail suggested any such thing.

05:24.180 --> 05:28.660
Rose had to set the record straight later by saying he didn't accuse Lal of

05:28.660 --> 05:30.980
knowingly publishing false information

05:31.180 --> 05:33.380
This is Moncton's pure invention.

05:34.980 --> 05:39.180
Now the first chairman of this intergovernmental panel on climate change

05:39.180 --> 05:42.780
was Sir John Horton and he said

05:42.780 --> 05:48.580
unless we announce disasters no one will listen.

05:48.580 --> 05:53.780
There from the chairman of the organisation which is supposed to be giving us

05:53.780 --> 05:58.980
unprejudiced science on climate change is a statement that

05:58.980 --> 06:03.540
unless we announce disasters no one will listen, a statement that we are going to

06:03.540 --> 06:05.180
reserve the right to ourselves

06:05.180 --> 06:08.500
to exaggerate the science so that we can make

06:08.500 --> 06:12.540
people listen to us. Sir John Houghton, whom you see there, the first

06:12.540 --> 06:17.420
chairman of the science panel of the IPCC said unless we announce disasters

06:17.420 --> 06:22.260
no one will listen. Moncton's most famous quote has an even more interesting history

06:22.260 --> 06:27.060
he cites a book that Houghton wrote on the subject without saying what it was

06:27.060 --> 06:30.820
but the thing about citing a source is that you actually have to have read the

06:30.820 --> 06:31.860
source yourself

06:31.860 --> 06:36.180
for example I don't have a copy of Houghton's book so I can't claim the quote

06:36.180 --> 06:37.060
isn't in there

06:37.060 --> 06:40.540
but I can cite a story in Britain's independent newspaper

06:40.540 --> 06:45.100
saying that the Houghton quote was made up. It traced the quote back to a November

06:45.100 --> 06:47.380
2006 column by Piers Ackerman

06:47.380 --> 06:50.940
writing in Australia's Daily Telegraph and here it is

06:50.940 --> 06:54.540
Ackerman does give the title of the book Global Warming

06:54.540 --> 06:59.140
the complete briefing published in 1994 but it's obvious he never read it

06:59.140 --> 07:02.980
and it's obvious Moncton never read it either because the independent checked

07:02.980 --> 07:03.500
the book

07:03.500 --> 07:08.180
and couldn't find the quote anywhere. On February 18th Ackerman decided that he

07:08.180 --> 07:10.540
hadn't got the quote from Houghton's book at all

07:10.540 --> 07:15.420
he'd got it from a Sunday Telegraph article dated September the 10th 1995

07:15.420 --> 07:20.340
and here it is. And what was the quote? Unless we announce disasters no one will

07:20.340 --> 07:20.900
listen?

07:21.620 --> 07:24.500
No. What Houghton actually said was

07:24.500 --> 07:27.540
if we want a good environmental policy in the future

07:27.540 --> 07:31.700
we'll have to have a disaster and he explained exactly what he meant by that

07:31.700 --> 07:35.580
it's like safety on public transport the only way humans will

07:35.580 --> 07:39.580
act is if there's been an accident. Ackerman explained

07:39.580 --> 07:43.720
how that remark came to be slightly paraphrased in the quotation sent to me

07:43.720 --> 07:48.260
which you'll probably never know. That sort of thing occurs in the blogosphere

07:48.260 --> 07:51.660
Well duh! Yes of course it does

07:51.660 --> 07:55.940
that's why all these urban myths you read on the internet can't be trusted

07:55.940 --> 08:02.140
but come on slightly changed according to Moncton the fake Houghton quote means

08:02.140 --> 08:05.540
we're going to just make it up so as to scare you until you listen

08:05.540 --> 08:08.980
so if this means the same thing as this

08:08.980 --> 08:14.500
and this means the same thing as this then quotes aren't really quotes at all

08:14.500 --> 08:18.180
they're just interpretations of what you think someone should have said

08:18.500 --> 08:23.220
and can be changed over and over again. After the independent story was published

08:23.220 --> 08:26.580
those who had been using the fabricated quote began backtracking

08:26.580 --> 08:30.340
but of course not apologising or accepting responsibility for their

08:30.340 --> 08:31.500
sloppy research

08:31.500 --> 08:34.500
my favourite excuse came from Christopher Booker

08:34.500 --> 08:38.020
another UK Telegraph contributor who said that he was

08:38.020 --> 08:41.540
misled by the internet into assuming the quote was genuine

08:41.540 --> 08:46.100
Yes! Damn that internet for confusing me and not letting me check a source properly

08:46.980 --> 08:51.620
But at least Booker agreed to take the fake quote out of his book in the next edition

08:51.620 --> 08:55.860
Moncton simply kept on using it and didn't change a word

08:55.860 --> 08:58.820
He said unless we announce disasters no one will listen

08:58.820 --> 09:02.740
or words to that effect. It came in a telegraph

09:02.740 --> 09:07.340
Sunday Telegraph article about a dozen years ago. He now tries to deny that he

09:07.340 --> 09:08.540
said anything like this

09:08.540 --> 09:11.700
but in fact he did. No! He didn't

09:11.940 --> 09:14.420
If you now know where this quote came from

09:14.420 --> 09:18.820
and you now accept that it's inaccurate then you shouldn't keep on using it

09:18.820 --> 09:22.020
however useful it may be in supporting your arguments

09:22.020 --> 09:26.420
you should check the telegraph story for yourself and tell people what Houghton

09:26.420 --> 09:31.220
actually said. In all his previous errors Moncton at least had the excuse that

09:31.220 --> 09:34.500
he's not a scientist and he has no scientific training

09:34.500 --> 09:37.620
so if he misunderstood and misrepresented the papers he was

09:37.620 --> 09:41.460
supposedly reading it comes as no surprise but here he

09:41.460 --> 09:45.300
should know better. Moncton has a diploma in journalism so

09:45.300 --> 09:48.580
he would have learned that one of the first rules of good journalism is

09:48.580 --> 09:53.060
you can't make up quotes or interpret what someone says or paraphrase what

09:53.060 --> 09:55.940
they say and put quotation marks around it and

09:55.940 --> 09:59.460
tell people they said it. Surely that must be obvious even to

09:59.460 --> 10:04.980
people with no training in journalism? Apparently not. The most worrying thing

10:04.980 --> 10:08.500
about these fabricated quotes is what I discovered in the comments

10:08.500 --> 10:13.060
that followed Ackermann's article. Some posters didn't seem to mind at all

10:13.060 --> 10:17.700
that they were being fed a fabrication. Peer's quote is correct.

10:17.700 --> 10:22.420
Different words but the same meaning. Then why change the original?

10:22.420 --> 10:27.620
Seems to be an accurate paraphrase to me but an accurate paraphrase is not the

10:27.620 --> 10:30.980
same as a quote and an inaccurate paraphrase purporting

10:30.980 --> 10:34.260
to be a quote is a fabrication. If the words are

10:34.260 --> 10:37.700
different but have the same meaning then why not stick with the words that

10:37.700 --> 10:41.940
were actually spoken? The only reason to change the quote even

10:41.940 --> 10:44.420
with a verb tense or a preposition change

10:44.420 --> 10:48.260
is that it does change the meaning. That's why people do it.

10:48.260 --> 10:51.860
It's not only downright dishonest and a clear case of fabrication

10:51.860 --> 10:56.180
it's also patronizing. Audiences shouldn't need to have quotes filtered

10:56.180 --> 10:58.900
through to them by a process of interpretation and

10:58.900 --> 11:02.820
re-wording by someone else. You can give your own opinion on a quote

11:02.820 --> 11:05.700
that's fine or tell people what you think it means

11:05.700 --> 11:10.500
but you can't change it or make it up. We're all capable of hearing a quote

11:10.500 --> 11:14.740
uncensored and making up our own minds about what we think it means.

11:14.740 --> 11:18.020
This is something Monckton preaches at nearly every presentation.

11:18.020 --> 11:21.780
I'm going to take the approach of Fox News. We report,

11:21.780 --> 11:26.580
you decide, I will give you a covenant that everything I say to you

11:26.580 --> 11:30.740
is independently verifiable. There has been no

11:30.740 --> 11:34.900
global warming for a decade. I'm just going to give it to you

11:34.900 --> 11:39.060
straight. For the truth alone is worthy of our

11:39.060 --> 11:45.060
entire devotion. And he said the Armageddon scenario that he depicts

11:45.060 --> 11:50.980
is not based on any scientific view. What I am striving for here

11:50.980 --> 11:54.900
is to reach the truth. The objective of science,

11:54.900 --> 12:00.740
of economics and of politics is nothing less than the truth. An admission on the

12:00.740 --> 12:03.220
part of the lead author of the sub-chapter in question

12:03.220 --> 12:06.580
that he knew that figure was wrong. And before we subjugate

12:06.580 --> 12:11.780
the truth to mere expediency, convenience or profit,

12:11.780 --> 12:14.980
it is first desirable to discern the truth.

12:14.980 --> 12:21.780
Unless we announce disasters, no one will listen. If you get the science

12:21.780 --> 12:23.860
wrong and the policy wrong because you didn't

12:23.860 --> 12:28.980
start with the truth, then people end up dead. You can check,

12:28.980 --> 12:32.820
should you wish to do so, that I am not misleading you or

12:32.820 --> 12:36.340
pushing you in any political or scientific

12:36.340 --> 12:40.980
or economic or moral direction.
