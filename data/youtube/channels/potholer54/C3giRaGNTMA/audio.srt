1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,600
It's a favourite tactic of anyone who wants to undermine science,

2
00:00:03,600 --> 00:00:06,920
compile a list of quotes usually from scientists

3
00:00:06,920 --> 00:00:11,000
and usually taken out of context. Monckton does this of course

4
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:15,120
but he also goes a step further. If he doesn't think the quote is convincing

5
00:00:15,120 --> 00:00:15,600
enough

6
00:00:15,600 --> 00:00:19,400
he'll simply change it. One of the climate gate conspirators here

7
00:00:19,400 --> 00:00:24,600
talking privately says there has been no global warming for a decade we cannot

8
00:00:24,600 --> 00:00:25,880
explain why

9
00:00:25,880 --> 00:00:31,340
it is a travesty that we can't. The first thing to be suspicious of if someone

10
00:00:31,340 --> 00:00:32,640
throws a quote at you

11
00:00:32,640 --> 00:00:37,240
is the lack of a source and very few Monckton quotes are properly sourced

12
00:00:37,240 --> 00:00:41,060
which of course makes it harder to see whether they're real or imaginary.

13
00:00:41,060 --> 00:00:44,480
Climate gate for example isn't a source

14
00:00:44,480 --> 00:00:48,780
a date and an email reference would be a source but this one is fairly easy to

15
00:00:48,780 --> 00:00:49,580
track down

16
00:00:49,580 --> 00:00:53,360
because the East Anglia University emails are all listed on the net

17
00:00:53,480 --> 00:00:57,920
and there's a search engine to locate particular emails and this is the famous

18
00:00:57,920 --> 00:01:00,520
one from Trenberth that Monckton is referring to.

19
00:01:00,520 --> 00:01:05,120
The exact quote is the fact is that we can't account for the lack of warming at

20
00:01:05,120 --> 00:01:05,640
the moment

21
00:01:05,640 --> 00:01:09,920
and it's a travesty that we can't. Now if this means the same thing

22
00:01:09,920 --> 00:01:14,560
then why change it? Trenberth of course was referring to the energy budget.

23
00:01:14,560 --> 00:01:17,740
Monckton thinks he should have been saying something more akin to a key

24
00:01:17,740 --> 00:01:18,800
Monckton argument

25
00:01:18,800 --> 00:01:22,400
about the lack of global warming for a decade so presto

26
00:01:22,440 --> 00:01:26,880
Monckton changes the quote to make it comply. Of course it now means something

27
00:01:26,880 --> 00:01:27,720
very different.

28
00:01:27,720 --> 00:01:30,800
If you want to argue that it doesn't change the meaning at all

29
00:01:30,800 --> 00:01:34,840
and it still means exactly the same thing then why change it?

30
00:01:34,840 --> 00:01:39,240
Why not tell us what Trenberth actually wrote and let us make up our own minds

31
00:01:39,240 --> 00:01:40,240
about the meaning?

32
00:01:40,240 --> 00:01:44,240
This is a question I want you to bear in mind as we go through a list of other

33
00:01:44,240 --> 00:01:45,600
fabricated quotes.

34
00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:50,620
If this was an isolated case it could be regarded as a sloppy error

35
00:01:51,060 --> 00:01:54,900
but it's part of a pattern of carefully changed and rearranged quotes

36
00:01:54,900 --> 00:01:58,180
that pepper Monckton's presentations. Here's another one.

37
00:01:58,180 --> 00:02:03,400
He said the Argeddon scenario that he depicts is not based on any

38
00:02:03,400 --> 00:02:04,460
scientific

39
00:02:04,460 --> 00:02:08,060
view. This is supposed to be a quote from Justice Burton

40
00:02:08,060 --> 00:02:12,140
the judge who ruled on the use of Al Gore's film An Inconvenient Truth

41
00:02:12,140 --> 00:02:16,260
in British schools. I was skeptical of this as soon as I heard it

42
00:02:16,260 --> 00:02:20,220
because I was aware of the court case and this quote just didn't seem to fit

43
00:02:20,260 --> 00:02:24,660
the judge's final ruling. So I checked a transcript of the summing up.

44
00:02:24,660 --> 00:02:28,660
No surprise, Monckton had changed it. This is what the judge

45
00:02:28,660 --> 00:02:33,460
actually said. It is common ground that if indeed Greenland melted it would

46
00:02:33,460 --> 00:02:35,180
release this amount of water

47
00:02:35,180 --> 00:02:40,620
but only after and over millennia so that the Armageddon scenario he predicts

48
00:02:40,620 --> 00:02:45,140
in so far as it suggests that sea level rises of seven metres might occur in the

49
00:02:45,140 --> 00:02:46,340
immediate future

50
00:02:46,340 --> 00:02:50,500
is not in line with the scientific consensus. It's interesting to see what

51
00:02:50,500 --> 00:02:52,540
Monckton doesn't like in a quote.

52
00:02:52,540 --> 00:02:56,220
Monckton always questions whether there's a consensus on climate change

53
00:02:56,220 --> 00:02:59,840
so he changes not in line with the scientific consensus

54
00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:04,980
to not based on any scientific view. Now in his speech and this slide Monckton

55
00:03:04,980 --> 00:03:08,900
does preface this misquote by pointing out the judge was referring to Gore's

56
00:03:08,900 --> 00:03:11,060
claim of a 20-foot sea level rise

57
00:03:11,060 --> 00:03:15,540
but that's not always the case. According to an interview with Climate Depot in

58
00:03:15,540 --> 00:03:16,700
2009

59
00:03:16,700 --> 00:03:20,460
Monckton said the judge was referring to Gore's entire movie

60
00:03:20,460 --> 00:03:27,060
and this has inevitably been copied and pasted all over the internet.

61
00:03:27,060 --> 00:03:31,980
Now I'm no fan of Al Gore's film. I've criticized it myself in an earlier video

62
00:03:31,980 --> 00:03:35,220
and I agree with Monckton that it shouldn't be shown in schools

63
00:03:35,220 --> 00:03:38,420
but I didn't need to misrepresent what the judge said

64
00:03:38,420 --> 00:03:42,540
in order to rebut Gore's film. I just needed to state the facts.

65
00:03:43,380 --> 00:03:46,940
An appalling admission which was compounded by an admission on the part

66
00:03:46,940 --> 00:03:48,900
of the lead author of the subchapter in question

67
00:03:48,900 --> 00:03:52,140
that he knew that figure was wrong but had left it in anyway

68
00:03:52,140 --> 00:03:55,980
because he knew that the intergovernmental panel on climate change

69
00:03:55,980 --> 00:03:59,180
wanted to influence governments and politicians.

70
00:03:59,180 --> 00:04:02,580
So in other words once again an admission they were going to lie.

71
00:04:02,580 --> 00:04:06,700
Monckton is referring to Dr. Murari Lal who wrote the report on Himalayan

72
00:04:06,700 --> 00:04:08,580
glaciers for the IPCC.

73
00:04:08,980 --> 00:04:12,900
The now famous catalogue of errors began when New Scientist interviewed

74
00:04:12,900 --> 00:04:14,180
Said Haznain

75
00:04:14,180 --> 00:04:18,700
lead author of a four-year study by the International Commission on Snow and Ice.

76
00:04:18,700 --> 00:04:23,340
According to New Scientist Haznain's four-year study indicates that all the

77
00:04:23,340 --> 00:04:25,740
glaciers in the central and eastern Himalayas

78
00:04:25,740 --> 00:04:29,900
could disappear by 2035 at their present rate of decline.

79
00:04:29,900 --> 00:04:33,540
New Scientist is now calling it a speculative comment

80
00:04:33,540 --> 00:04:36,580
but it wasn't reported as a speculative comment

81
00:04:36,780 --> 00:04:40,340
it was reported as the conclusion of a four-year study.

82
00:04:40,340 --> 00:04:43,700
The World Wide Fund for Nature picked it up and Lal

83
00:04:43,700 --> 00:04:48,780
incredible as it may sound got his information from the WWF.

84
00:04:48,780 --> 00:04:52,580
In the Mail on Sunday story David Rose quoted Lal as saying

85
00:04:52,580 --> 00:04:56,340
we knew the WWF report with the 2035 date was

86
00:04:56,340 --> 00:05:01,180
grey literature which means material not published in a peer-reviewed journal

87
00:05:01,180 --> 00:05:04,580
but it was never picked up by any of the authors in our working group

88
00:05:04,580 --> 00:05:07,620
nor by any of the more than 500 external reviewers

89
00:05:07,620 --> 00:05:12,580
by the governments to which it was sent or by the final IPCC review editors.

90
00:05:12,580 --> 00:05:17,660
Moncton turned Lal's statement that he knew the 2035 figure wasn't peer-reviewed

91
00:05:17,660 --> 00:05:21,060
into an admission by Lal that he knew the figure was wrong

92
00:05:21,060 --> 00:05:24,180
but not even the Mail suggested any such thing.

93
00:05:24,180 --> 00:05:28,660
Rose had to set the record straight later by saying he didn't accuse Lal of

94
00:05:28,660 --> 00:05:30,980
knowingly publishing false information

95
00:05:31,180 --> 00:05:33,380
This is Moncton's pure invention.

96
00:05:34,980 --> 00:05:39,180
Now the first chairman of this intergovernmental panel on climate change

97
00:05:39,180 --> 00:05:42,780
was Sir John Horton and he said

98
00:05:42,780 --> 00:05:48,580
unless we announce disasters no one will listen.

99
00:05:48,580 --> 00:05:53,780
There from the chairman of the organisation which is supposed to be giving us

100
00:05:53,780 --> 00:05:58,980
unprejudiced science on climate change is a statement that

101
00:05:58,980 --> 00:06:03,540
unless we announce disasters no one will listen, a statement that we are going to

102
00:06:03,540 --> 00:06:05,180
reserve the right to ourselves

103
00:06:05,180 --> 00:06:08,500
to exaggerate the science so that we can make

104
00:06:08,500 --> 00:06:12,540
people listen to us. Sir John Houghton, whom you see there, the first

105
00:06:12,540 --> 00:06:17,420
chairman of the science panel of the IPCC said unless we announce disasters

106
00:06:17,420 --> 00:06:22,260
no one will listen. Moncton's most famous quote has an even more interesting history

107
00:06:22,260 --> 00:06:27,060
he cites a book that Houghton wrote on the subject without saying what it was

108
00:06:27,060 --> 00:06:30,820
but the thing about citing a source is that you actually have to have read the

109
00:06:30,820 --> 00:06:31,860
source yourself

110
00:06:31,860 --> 00:06:36,180
for example I don't have a copy of Houghton's book so I can't claim the quote

111
00:06:36,180 --> 00:06:37,060
isn't in there

112
00:06:37,060 --> 00:06:40,540
but I can cite a story in Britain's independent newspaper

113
00:06:40,540 --> 00:06:45,100
saying that the Houghton quote was made up. It traced the quote back to a November

114
00:06:45,100 --> 00:06:47,380
2006 column by Piers Ackerman

115
00:06:47,380 --> 00:06:50,940
writing in Australia's Daily Telegraph and here it is

116
00:06:50,940 --> 00:06:54,540
Ackerman does give the title of the book Global Warming

117
00:06:54,540 --> 00:06:59,140
the complete briefing published in 1994 but it's obvious he never read it

118
00:06:59,140 --> 00:07:02,980
and it's obvious Moncton never read it either because the independent checked

119
00:07:02,980 --> 00:07:03,500
the book

120
00:07:03,500 --> 00:07:08,180
and couldn't find the quote anywhere. On February 18th Ackerman decided that he

121
00:07:08,180 --> 00:07:10,540
hadn't got the quote from Houghton's book at all

122
00:07:10,540 --> 00:07:15,420
he'd got it from a Sunday Telegraph article dated September the 10th 1995

123
00:07:15,420 --> 00:07:20,340
and here it is. And what was the quote? Unless we announce disasters no one will

124
00:07:20,340 --> 00:07:20,900
listen?

125
00:07:21,620 --> 00:07:24,500
No. What Houghton actually said was

126
00:07:24,500 --> 00:07:27,540
if we want a good environmental policy in the future

127
00:07:27,540 --> 00:07:31,700
we'll have to have a disaster and he explained exactly what he meant by that

128
00:07:31,700 --> 00:07:35,580
it's like safety on public transport the only way humans will

129
00:07:35,580 --> 00:07:39,580
act is if there's been an accident. Ackerman explained

130
00:07:39,580 --> 00:07:43,720
how that remark came to be slightly paraphrased in the quotation sent to me

131
00:07:43,720 --> 00:07:48,260
which you'll probably never know. That sort of thing occurs in the blogosphere

132
00:07:48,260 --> 00:07:51,660
Well duh! Yes of course it does

133
00:07:51,660 --> 00:07:55,940
that's why all these urban myths you read on the internet can't be trusted

134
00:07:55,940 --> 00:08:02,140
but come on slightly changed according to Moncton the fake Houghton quote means

135
00:08:02,140 --> 00:08:05,540
we're going to just make it up so as to scare you until you listen

136
00:08:05,540 --> 00:08:08,980
so if this means the same thing as this

137
00:08:08,980 --> 00:08:14,500
and this means the same thing as this then quotes aren't really quotes at all

138
00:08:14,500 --> 00:08:18,180
they're just interpretations of what you think someone should have said

139
00:08:18,500 --> 00:08:23,220
and can be changed over and over again. After the independent story was published

140
00:08:23,220 --> 00:08:26,580
those who had been using the fabricated quote began backtracking

141
00:08:26,580 --> 00:08:30,340
but of course not apologising or accepting responsibility for their

142
00:08:30,340 --> 00:08:31,500
sloppy research

143
00:08:31,500 --> 00:08:34,500
my favourite excuse came from Christopher Booker

144
00:08:34,500 --> 00:08:38,020
another UK Telegraph contributor who said that he was

145
00:08:38,020 --> 00:08:41,540
misled by the internet into assuming the quote was genuine

146
00:08:41,540 --> 00:08:46,100
Yes! Damn that internet for confusing me and not letting me check a source properly

147
00:08:46,980 --> 00:08:51,620
But at least Booker agreed to take the fake quote out of his book in the next edition

148
00:08:51,620 --> 00:08:55,860
Moncton simply kept on using it and didn't change a word

149
00:08:55,860 --> 00:08:58,820
He said unless we announce disasters no one will listen

150
00:08:58,820 --> 00:09:02,740
or words to that effect. It came in a telegraph

151
00:09:02,740 --> 00:09:07,340
Sunday Telegraph article about a dozen years ago. He now tries to deny that he

152
00:09:07,340 --> 00:09:08,540
said anything like this

153
00:09:08,540 --> 00:09:11,700
but in fact he did. No! He didn't

154
00:09:11,940 --> 00:09:14,420
If you now know where this quote came from

155
00:09:14,420 --> 00:09:18,820
and you now accept that it's inaccurate then you shouldn't keep on using it

156
00:09:18,820 --> 00:09:22,020
however useful it may be in supporting your arguments

157
00:09:22,020 --> 00:09:26,420
you should check the telegraph story for yourself and tell people what Houghton

158
00:09:26,420 --> 00:09:31,220
actually said. In all his previous errors Moncton at least had the excuse that

159
00:09:31,220 --> 00:09:34,500
he's not a scientist and he has no scientific training

160
00:09:34,500 --> 00:09:37,620
so if he misunderstood and misrepresented the papers he was

161
00:09:37,620 --> 00:09:41,460
supposedly reading it comes as no surprise but here he

162
00:09:41,460 --> 00:09:45,300
should know better. Moncton has a diploma in journalism so

163
00:09:45,300 --> 00:09:48,580
he would have learned that one of the first rules of good journalism is

164
00:09:48,580 --> 00:09:53,060
you can't make up quotes or interpret what someone says or paraphrase what

165
00:09:53,060 --> 00:09:55,940
they say and put quotation marks around it and

166
00:09:55,940 --> 00:09:59,460
tell people they said it. Surely that must be obvious even to

167
00:09:59,460 --> 00:10:04,980
people with no training in journalism? Apparently not. The most worrying thing

168
00:10:04,980 --> 00:10:08,500
about these fabricated quotes is what I discovered in the comments

169
00:10:08,500 --> 00:10:13,060
that followed Ackermann's article. Some posters didn't seem to mind at all

170
00:10:13,060 --> 00:10:17,700
that they were being fed a fabrication. Peer's quote is correct.

171
00:10:17,700 --> 00:10:22,420
Different words but the same meaning. Then why change the original?

172
00:10:22,420 --> 00:10:27,620
Seems to be an accurate paraphrase to me but an accurate paraphrase is not the

173
00:10:27,620 --> 00:10:30,980
same as a quote and an inaccurate paraphrase purporting

174
00:10:30,980 --> 00:10:34,260
to be a quote is a fabrication. If the words are

175
00:10:34,260 --> 00:10:37,700
different but have the same meaning then why not stick with the words that

176
00:10:37,700 --> 00:10:41,940
were actually spoken? The only reason to change the quote even

177
00:10:41,940 --> 00:10:44,420
with a verb tense or a preposition change

178
00:10:44,420 --> 00:10:48,260
is that it does change the meaning. That's why people do it.

179
00:10:48,260 --> 00:10:51,860
It's not only downright dishonest and a clear case of fabrication

180
00:10:51,860 --> 00:10:56,180
it's also patronizing. Audiences shouldn't need to have quotes filtered

181
00:10:56,180 --> 00:10:58,900
through to them by a process of interpretation and

182
00:10:58,900 --> 00:11:02,820
re-wording by someone else. You can give your own opinion on a quote

183
00:11:02,820 --> 00:11:05,700
that's fine or tell people what you think it means

184
00:11:05,700 --> 00:11:10,500
but you can't change it or make it up. We're all capable of hearing a quote

185
00:11:10,500 --> 00:11:14,740
uncensored and making up our own minds about what we think it means.

186
00:11:14,740 --> 00:11:18,020
This is something Monckton preaches at nearly every presentation.

187
00:11:18,020 --> 00:11:21,780
I'm going to take the approach of Fox News. We report,

188
00:11:21,780 --> 00:11:26,580
you decide, I will give you a covenant that everything I say to you

189
00:11:26,580 --> 00:11:30,740
is independently verifiable. There has been no

190
00:11:30,740 --> 00:11:34,900
global warming for a decade. I'm just going to give it to you

191
00:11:34,900 --> 00:11:39,060
straight. For the truth alone is worthy of our

192
00:11:39,060 --> 00:11:45,060
entire devotion. And he said the Armageddon scenario that he depicts

193
00:11:45,060 --> 00:11:50,980
is not based on any scientific view. What I am striving for here

194
00:11:50,980 --> 00:11:54,900
is to reach the truth. The objective of science,

195
00:11:54,900 --> 00:12:00,740
of economics and of politics is nothing less than the truth. An admission on the

196
00:12:00,740 --> 00:12:03,220
part of the lead author of the sub-chapter in question

197
00:12:03,220 --> 00:12:06,580
that he knew that figure was wrong. And before we subjugate

198
00:12:06,580 --> 00:12:11,780
the truth to mere expediency, convenience or profit,

199
00:12:11,780 --> 00:12:14,980
it is first desirable to discern the truth.

200
00:12:14,980 --> 00:12:21,780
Unless we announce disasters, no one will listen. If you get the science

201
00:12:21,780 --> 00:12:23,860
wrong and the policy wrong because you didn't

202
00:12:23,860 --> 00:12:28,980
start with the truth, then people end up dead. You can check,

203
00:12:28,980 --> 00:12:32,820
should you wish to do so, that I am not misleading you or

204
00:12:32,820 --> 00:12:36,340
pushing you in any political or scientific

205
00:12:36,340 --> 00:12:40,980
or economic or moral direction.
