0	3600	It's a favourite tactic of anyone who wants to undermine science,
3600	6920	compile a list of quotes usually from scientists
6920	11000	and usually taken out of context. Monckton does this of course
11000	15120	but he also goes a step further. If he doesn't think the quote is convincing
15120	15600	enough
15600	19400	he'll simply change it. One of the climate gate conspirators here
19400	24600	talking privately says there has been no global warming for a decade we cannot
24600	25880	explain why
25880	31340	it is a travesty that we can't. The first thing to be suspicious of if someone
31340	32640	throws a quote at you
32640	37240	is the lack of a source and very few Monckton quotes are properly sourced
37240	41060	which of course makes it harder to see whether they're real or imaginary.
41060	44480	Climate gate for example isn't a source
44480	48780	a date and an email reference would be a source but this one is fairly easy to
48780	49580	track down
49580	53360	because the East Anglia University emails are all listed on the net
53480	57920	and there's a search engine to locate particular emails and this is the famous
57920	60520	one from Trenberth that Monckton is referring to.
60520	65120	The exact quote is the fact is that we can't account for the lack of warming at
65120	65640	the moment
65640	69920	and it's a travesty that we can't. Now if this means the same thing
69920	74560	then why change it? Trenberth of course was referring to the energy budget.
74560	77740	Monckton thinks he should have been saying something more akin to a key
77740	78800	Monckton argument
78800	82400	about the lack of global warming for a decade so presto
82440	86880	Monckton changes the quote to make it comply. Of course it now means something
86880	87720	very different.
87720	90800	If you want to argue that it doesn't change the meaning at all
90800	94840	and it still means exactly the same thing then why change it?
94840	99240	Why not tell us what Trenberth actually wrote and let us make up our own minds
99240	100240	about the meaning?
100240	104240	This is a question I want you to bear in mind as we go through a list of other
104240	105600	fabricated quotes.
105600	110620	If this was an isolated case it could be regarded as a sloppy error
111060	114900	but it's part of a pattern of carefully changed and rearranged quotes
114900	118180	that pepper Monckton's presentations. Here's another one.
118180	123400	He said the Argeddon scenario that he depicts is not based on any
123400	124460	scientific
124460	128060	view. This is supposed to be a quote from Justice Burton
128060	132140	the judge who ruled on the use of Al Gore's film An Inconvenient Truth
132140	136260	in British schools. I was skeptical of this as soon as I heard it
136260	140220	because I was aware of the court case and this quote just didn't seem to fit
140260	144660	the judge's final ruling. So I checked a transcript of the summing up.
144660	148660	No surprise, Monckton had changed it. This is what the judge
148660	153460	actually said. It is common ground that if indeed Greenland melted it would
153460	155180	release this amount of water
155180	160620	but only after and over millennia so that the Armageddon scenario he predicts
160620	165140	in so far as it suggests that sea level rises of seven metres might occur in the
165140	166340	immediate future
166340	170500	is not in line with the scientific consensus. It's interesting to see what
170500	172540	Monckton doesn't like in a quote.
172540	176220	Monckton always questions whether there's a consensus on climate change
176220	179840	so he changes not in line with the scientific consensus
179840	184980	to not based on any scientific view. Now in his speech and this slide Monckton
184980	188900	does preface this misquote by pointing out the judge was referring to Gore's
188900	191060	claim of a 20-foot sea level rise
191060	195540	but that's not always the case. According to an interview with Climate Depot in
195540	196700	2009
196700	200460	Monckton said the judge was referring to Gore's entire movie
200460	207060	and this has inevitably been copied and pasted all over the internet.
207060	211980	Now I'm no fan of Al Gore's film. I've criticized it myself in an earlier video
211980	215220	and I agree with Monckton that it shouldn't be shown in schools
215220	218420	but I didn't need to misrepresent what the judge said
218420	222540	in order to rebut Gore's film. I just needed to state the facts.
223380	226940	An appalling admission which was compounded by an admission on the part
226940	228900	of the lead author of the subchapter in question
228900	232140	that he knew that figure was wrong but had left it in anyway
232140	235980	because he knew that the intergovernmental panel on climate change
235980	239180	wanted to influence governments and politicians.
239180	242580	So in other words once again an admission they were going to lie.
242580	246700	Monckton is referring to Dr. Murari Lal who wrote the report on Himalayan
246700	248580	glaciers for the IPCC.
248980	252900	The now famous catalogue of errors began when New Scientist interviewed
252900	254180	Said Haznain
254180	258700	lead author of a four-year study by the International Commission on Snow and Ice.
258700	263340	According to New Scientist Haznain's four-year study indicates that all the
263340	265740	glaciers in the central and eastern Himalayas
265740	269900	could disappear by 2035 at their present rate of decline.
269900	273540	New Scientist is now calling it a speculative comment
273540	276580	but it wasn't reported as a speculative comment
276780	280340	it was reported as the conclusion of a four-year study.
280340	283700	The World Wide Fund for Nature picked it up and Lal
283700	288780	incredible as it may sound got his information from the WWF.
288780	292580	In the Mail on Sunday story David Rose quoted Lal as saying
292580	296340	we knew the WWF report with the 2035 date was
296340	301180	grey literature which means material not published in a peer-reviewed journal
301180	304580	but it was never picked up by any of the authors in our working group
304580	307620	nor by any of the more than 500 external reviewers
307620	312580	by the governments to which it was sent or by the final IPCC review editors.
312580	317660	Moncton turned Lal's statement that he knew the 2035 figure wasn't peer-reviewed
317660	321060	into an admission by Lal that he knew the figure was wrong
321060	324180	but not even the Mail suggested any such thing.
324180	328660	Rose had to set the record straight later by saying he didn't accuse Lal of
328660	330980	knowingly publishing false information
331180	333380	This is Moncton's pure invention.
334980	339180	Now the first chairman of this intergovernmental panel on climate change
339180	342780	was Sir John Horton and he said
342780	348580	unless we announce disasters no one will listen.
348580	353780	There from the chairman of the organisation which is supposed to be giving us
353780	358980	unprejudiced science on climate change is a statement that
358980	363540	unless we announce disasters no one will listen, a statement that we are going to
363540	365180	reserve the right to ourselves
365180	368500	to exaggerate the science so that we can make
368500	372540	people listen to us. Sir John Houghton, whom you see there, the first
372540	377420	chairman of the science panel of the IPCC said unless we announce disasters
377420	382260	no one will listen. Moncton's most famous quote has an even more interesting history
382260	387060	he cites a book that Houghton wrote on the subject without saying what it was
387060	390820	but the thing about citing a source is that you actually have to have read the
390820	391860	source yourself
391860	396180	for example I don't have a copy of Houghton's book so I can't claim the quote
396180	397060	isn't in there
397060	400540	but I can cite a story in Britain's independent newspaper
400540	405100	saying that the Houghton quote was made up. It traced the quote back to a November
405100	407380	2006 column by Piers Ackerman
407380	410940	writing in Australia's Daily Telegraph and here it is
410940	414540	Ackerman does give the title of the book Global Warming
414540	419140	the complete briefing published in 1994 but it's obvious he never read it
419140	422980	and it's obvious Moncton never read it either because the independent checked
422980	423500	the book
423500	428180	and couldn't find the quote anywhere. On February 18th Ackerman decided that he
428180	430540	hadn't got the quote from Houghton's book at all
430540	435420	he'd got it from a Sunday Telegraph article dated September the 10th 1995
435420	440340	and here it is. And what was the quote? Unless we announce disasters no one will
440340	440900	listen?
441620	444500	No. What Houghton actually said was
444500	447540	if we want a good environmental policy in the future
447540	451700	we'll have to have a disaster and he explained exactly what he meant by that
451700	455580	it's like safety on public transport the only way humans will
455580	459580	act is if there's been an accident. Ackerman explained
459580	463720	how that remark came to be slightly paraphrased in the quotation sent to me
463720	468260	which you'll probably never know. That sort of thing occurs in the blogosphere
468260	471660	Well duh! Yes of course it does
471660	475940	that's why all these urban myths you read on the internet can't be trusted
475940	482140	but come on slightly changed according to Moncton the fake Houghton quote means
482140	485540	we're going to just make it up so as to scare you until you listen
485540	488980	so if this means the same thing as this
488980	494500	and this means the same thing as this then quotes aren't really quotes at all
494500	498180	they're just interpretations of what you think someone should have said
498500	503220	and can be changed over and over again. After the independent story was published
503220	506580	those who had been using the fabricated quote began backtracking
506580	510340	but of course not apologising or accepting responsibility for their
510340	511500	sloppy research
511500	514500	my favourite excuse came from Christopher Booker
514500	518020	another UK Telegraph contributor who said that he was
518020	521540	misled by the internet into assuming the quote was genuine
521540	526100	Yes! Damn that internet for confusing me and not letting me check a source properly
526980	531620	But at least Booker agreed to take the fake quote out of his book in the next edition
531620	535860	Moncton simply kept on using it and didn't change a word
535860	538820	He said unless we announce disasters no one will listen
538820	542740	or words to that effect. It came in a telegraph
542740	547340	Sunday Telegraph article about a dozen years ago. He now tries to deny that he
547340	548540	said anything like this
548540	551700	but in fact he did. No! He didn't
551940	554420	If you now know where this quote came from
554420	558820	and you now accept that it's inaccurate then you shouldn't keep on using it
558820	562020	however useful it may be in supporting your arguments
562020	566420	you should check the telegraph story for yourself and tell people what Houghton
566420	571220	actually said. In all his previous errors Moncton at least had the excuse that
571220	574500	he's not a scientist and he has no scientific training
574500	577620	so if he misunderstood and misrepresented the papers he was
577620	581460	supposedly reading it comes as no surprise but here he
581460	585300	should know better. Moncton has a diploma in journalism so
585300	588580	he would have learned that one of the first rules of good journalism is
588580	593060	you can't make up quotes or interpret what someone says or paraphrase what
593060	595940	they say and put quotation marks around it and
595940	599460	tell people they said it. Surely that must be obvious even to
599460	604980	people with no training in journalism? Apparently not. The most worrying thing
604980	608500	about these fabricated quotes is what I discovered in the comments
608500	613060	that followed Ackermann's article. Some posters didn't seem to mind at all
613060	617700	that they were being fed a fabrication. Peer's quote is correct.
617700	622420	Different words but the same meaning. Then why change the original?
622420	627620	Seems to be an accurate paraphrase to me but an accurate paraphrase is not the
627620	630980	same as a quote and an inaccurate paraphrase purporting
630980	634260	to be a quote is a fabrication. If the words are
634260	637700	different but have the same meaning then why not stick with the words that
637700	641940	were actually spoken? The only reason to change the quote even
641940	644420	with a verb tense or a preposition change
644420	648260	is that it does change the meaning. That's why people do it.
648260	651860	It's not only downright dishonest and a clear case of fabrication
651860	656180	it's also patronizing. Audiences shouldn't need to have quotes filtered
656180	658900	through to them by a process of interpretation and
658900	662820	re-wording by someone else. You can give your own opinion on a quote
662820	665700	that's fine or tell people what you think it means
665700	670500	but you can't change it or make it up. We're all capable of hearing a quote
670500	674740	uncensored and making up our own minds about what we think it means.
674740	678020	This is something Monckton preaches at nearly every presentation.
678020	681780	I'm going to take the approach of Fox News. We report,
681780	686580	you decide, I will give you a covenant that everything I say to you
686580	690740	is independently verifiable. There has been no
690740	694900	global warming for a decade. I'm just going to give it to you
694900	699060	straight. For the truth alone is worthy of our
699060	705060	entire devotion. And he said the Armageddon scenario that he depicts
705060	710980	is not based on any scientific view. What I am striving for here
710980	714900	is to reach the truth. The objective of science,
714900	720740	of economics and of politics is nothing less than the truth. An admission on the
720740	723220	part of the lead author of the sub-chapter in question
723220	726580	that he knew that figure was wrong. And before we subjugate
726580	731780	the truth to mere expediency, convenience or profit,
731780	734980	it is first desirable to discern the truth.
734980	741780	Unless we announce disasters, no one will listen. If you get the science
741780	743860	wrong and the policy wrong because you didn't
743860	748980	start with the truth, then people end up dead. You can check,
748980	752820	should you wish to do so, that I am not misleading you or
752820	756340	pushing you in any political or scientific
756340	760980	or economic or moral direction.
