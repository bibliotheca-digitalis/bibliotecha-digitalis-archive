0	4000	By now I've dealt with most of the big internet myths about climate change.
4000	8000	I've tracked down their sources and shown, by simple comparison,
8000	12000	that the sources have nearly always been misinterpreted.
12000	16000	Papers don't say what the myth-makers claim they say,
16000	19000	or important conclusions have been left out altogether.
19000	23000	Quotes have been misquoted or fabricated, and graphs have been altered.
23000	27000	The scale of the consequences of climate change have often been exaggerated,
27000	29000	and the time scales contracted.
29000	33000	But what about the internet myths for which there's no source?
33000	35000	They're just...
35000	38000	Well, let's start with the first one, and you can see for yourselves.
38000	43000	Why do we suppose that carbon dioxide is responsible for our changing climate?
45000	49000	CO2 forms only a very small part of the Earth's atmosphere.
49000	53000	Do you happen to know what percentage of the atmosphere is carbon dioxide?
53000	57000	This tiny little sliver is carbon dioxide.
57000	62000	It comprises only about one twenty-five hundredth of the atmosphere.
62000	66000	Only four percent of our greenhouse gas is carbon dioxide.
66000	69000	It's an incredibly small portion.
69000	73000	Carbon dioxide is only a tiny trace gas in the atmosphere.
73000	83000	CO2 now occupies, get this, one ten-thousandth more of the atmosphere than it did in 1750.
83000	86000	Now there's one thing all of these claims have in common.
86000	91000	Okay, they're all made by people who aren't climate researchers, but that's not it.
91000	94000	What they have in common is that none of them gives a conclusion
94000	99000	based on any kind of experiment or observation or measurement or calculation.
99000	106000	They simply feel that because CO2 makes up what Durkin calls a very small part of the atmosphere,
106000	112000	or as Tim Ball calls it, incredibly small, or tiny according to John Coleman,
112000	116000	that it must therefore only exert a tiny influence on climate.
116000	120000	In other words, they're basing their conclusions on just one thing.
120000	123000	They're relying on feeling.
123000	127000	Yes, to counter those elitist scientists and their observations and measurements we have
127000	130000	nothing more than feeling,
130000	135000	which is why Durkin's argument wasn't an experiment or a measurement or a calculation.
135000	137000	It was a question he never answered.
137000	142000	Why do we suppose that carbon dioxide is responsible for our changing climate?
142000	146000	It's a good question, and of course the answer can be found in thousands of scientific papers
146000	150000	that have been written on the subject over the last 120 years.
150000	153000	But for some reason Durkin didn't answer his own question.
153000	159000	He simply appealed to our gut instinct by giving us his feeling and Tim Ball's feeling
159000	163000	that if something's tiny, it would surely have a tiny effect.
164000	169000	Now I do agree that this feeling method of scientific inquiry is much easier.
169000	172000	It doesn't require any research or any difficult calculations,
172000	176000	or any knowledge of physics, or expensive lab equipment.
176000	180000	You don't need to spend years studying or reading the scientific literature,
180000	185000	or trying to understand those fancy graphs that only elitist scientists seem to understand.
185000	191000	All you need in order to come up with what's known in feeling world as a theory is the following.
191000	193000	An armchair?
194000	198000	Once you're sitting comfortably in the armchair, just wait till a thought bubble appears
198000	200000	and you've instantly got a theory.
200000	204000	See, none of that messy experimenting or years of data collecting
204000	207000	or complicated calculating is even necessary.
207000	213000	Now you can make your own graph based on what you feel is obvious, completely devoid of figures,
213000	216000	like this one from the International Journal of Feelings
216000	220000	that compares the amount of stuff with the effect of that stuff.
221000	225000	And instantly we see that heaps of stuff leads to a humongous effect,
225000	229000	while a tiny amount of stuff leads to a teeny weeny effect.
229000	231000	It's just common sense.
231000	236000	But of course for everyone who explains this very obvious feeling that CO2 is so teeny weeny
236000	241000	that it can't have any effect, there's some know-it-all who's going to contradict him.
241000	244000	In this case, it's Mr Monkton.
244000	247000	Carbon dioxide is a plant food, it's necessary.
247000	249000	Plant food.
249000	254000	Yeah. Without it, all plant life and therefore all life that depends on it would disappear.
254000	257000	While the Monkton who says CO2 is hugely important
257000	260000	argues it out with the Monkton who claims it's negligible,
260000	265000	let me take the side of Mr Monkton, by which I mean this one.
265000	269000	According to the Biology textbooks, he's absolutely right.
269000	274000	All plant life depends on CO2, and nearly all animal life depends on plant life.
274000	277000	Yet it's amazing that the same people who argue that this
277000	283000	small part, tiny little sliver, incredibly small fraction of a percent of the Earth's atmosphere
283000	286000	is too negligible to have any impact,
286000	289000	also accept that it's responsible for nearly all life on Earth.
289000	296000	0.054%. It's less than half of one percent.
296000	298000	Yeah.
298000	299000	Unbelievable, isn't it?
299000	300000	Yeah.
300000	302000	You would think that it's absolutely frantic.
303000	308000	No, no, no. This is like millions and millions and millions and millions of years.
308000	311000	This is not good science.
311000	316000	CO2 makes plants grow, and that is a good thing.
316000	319000	What this tells us, as we'll see throughout this video,
319000	323000	is that feelings not only override scientific observation and measurement,
323000	327000	they even override observations by the feelings themselves.
327000	331000	The natural world is full of examples of trace amounts having huge effects.
331000	336000	Ozone in the stratosphere makes up a smaller proportion of the atmosphere than CO2,
336000	341000	but without it we'd receive lethal doses of ultraviolet radiation.
341000	346000	It's a shame we can't actually see carbon dioxide blocking outgoing radiation,
346000	349000	because even people who don't understand the numbers and calculations
349000	352000	would have a very graphic idea of what's happening.
352000	358000	Here's Dan Miller demonstrating with ink what 280 parts per million looks like.
358000	362000	That's the same concentration as pre-industrial CO2.
362000	366000	And then 390 parts per million, the concentration today.
366000	370000	Small things can indeed have big effects.
370000	374000	So if there's one thing that separates the scientists from the junk science feely,
374000	380000	it's the battle of observation, measurement and calculation against feelings, belief and guesswork.
380000	386000	Here, for example, is Congressman John Shimkus explaining during a congressional hearing on climate change
386000	390000	why 120 years of physics must be wrong.
390000	395000	Genesis 8, verse 21 and 22.
395000	398000	Never again will I curse the ground because of man,
398000	401000	even though every inclination of his heart is evil from childhood,
401000	405000	and never again will I destroy all living creatures as I have done.
405000	412000	As long as the earth endures, seedtime and harvest, cold and heat, summer and winter,
412000	415000	day and night will never cease.
415000	419000	The earth will end only when God declares it's time to be over.
419000	425000	Man will not destroy this earth. This earth will not be destroyed by a flood.
425000	429000	Well, that's very good news. But what's that got to do with climate change?
429000	432000	God will never destroy the earth or all living creatures,
432000	436000	but there's nothing in the Bible that says God won't prevent the climate from changing
436000	441000	any more than he seems inclined to prevent earthquakes, melting glaciers and deforestation.
441000	444000	You know, God's still up there. We're now going through a cooling spell.
444000	449000	No, I'm not going to argue about whether God's up there or whether the Bible is infallible
449000	452000	because it makes absolutely no difference in this case.
452000	456000	There's nothing in the Bible that says the climate won't change
456000	459000	and no sign that God won't allow the climate to change.
459000	464000	And Shimkus's feeling that climate change implies the end of the world or a global flood
464000	468000	or the extinction of all life is just that, a feeling.
468000	471000	It's a feeling shared by a lot of environmental activists,
471000	476000	one of whom left a post on my channel insisting that the oceans were going to boil.
476000	479000	I'm going to examine the origin of this myth in a future video,
479000	483000	but of course nothing supports it in the scientific literature.
483000	486000	What strange bedfellows these feelies make.
486000	489000	I'd like to speak to you about global warming
489000	495000	and about what we all can do to make an impact to help protect our planet and save our planet.
495000	497000	Once again, there's nothing in the published research,
498000	501000	you know, where the results of experiments and measurements are shown,
501000	506000	that says climate change will destroy the Earth or flood the Earth or extinguish all life.
508000	509000	And finally, this.
509000	513000	To think that we could affect weather all that much is pretty arrogant.
513000	518000	It's really arrogant for mankind to think he controls the climate of the universe.
518000	519000	That's right.
519000	524000	Carbon dioxide can't have any effect on the climate because that would be arrogant.
524000	526000	Now that may sound like scientific twaddle,
526000	531000	but in the feely world it's cutting-edge, unassailable belief.
531000	532000	And they can prove it.
532000	537000	If we look at another feely graph of global phenomena against lack of humility,
537000	541000	we can see that doubling carbon dioxide levels is much higher up the scale
541000	545000	than the idea that we're polluting the oceans, which is merely self-inflated,
545000	551000	or the assumption that we're destroying tropical rainforests, which achieves the level of haughty.
551000	556000	The more humble the feeling, the more likely it is that a phenomenon is occurring.
556000	559000	By the way, Charlton Heston seems to think that changing the climate
559000	563000	should be at the very top of the scale, intoxicating vanity.
563000	566000	You think man can destroy the planet.
566000	568000	What intoxicating vanity.
568000	574000	But like Kucinich and Shimkus, he's obviously confused climate change with destruction of the planet.
574000	577000	Sorry Chuck, but just look back in geological history
577000	581000	and you'll see that altering the climate doesn't make the Earth blow up.
581000	583000	Even Shimkus can confirm that.
583000	587000	Today we have about 388 parts per million in the atmosphere.
587000	590000	I think in the age of the dinosaurs where we had most flora and fauna,
590000	593000	we were probably at 4,000 parts per million.
593000	596000	OK, apart from the fact that it was more like 1,000 parts per million,
596000	601000	and apart from the rather dubious claim that there was more flora and fauna during the dinosaur era
601000	603000	than at any other time,
603000	607000	Shimkus is at least right about there being a lot more CO2 back then,
607000	610000	about three times as much as today.
610000	613000	And consequently, it was much hotter.
613000	616000	And consequently, there was no ice at the poles.
616000	621000	And consequently, the sea level was about 500 metres higher than today.
621000	624000	Not sure how that helps your case, John.
624000	628000	The predominance of feelings to explain the world around us is nothing new.
628000	633000	In the Middle Ages, doctors felt that bleeding a patient would get rid of sickness.
633000	638000	Medieval scholars felt that there must be some mysterious substance inside combustible material
638000	641000	that caused them to burst into flames.
641000	642000	It was obvious.
642000	647000	And of course it was just common sense that boats made out of metal wouldn't float,
647000	651000	heavy objects fell faster than light ones, and the Sun orbited the Earth.
651000	656000	But in the 17th century, observation and inference quickly established themselves
656000	659000	as the best way to understand the world around us.
659000	664000	People began to do experiments and measure things and make calculations.
664000	670000	Today, no scientist would be taken seriously if he just sat in an armchair dreaming up ideas,
670000	673000	guessing at how he felt the world worked.
673000	678000	But in the Internet age, where everyone gets to comment and everyone has an opinion,
678000	681000	that's how people seem to think science works.
681000	685000	The theory of evolution, plate tectonic theory, and heliocentric theory,
685000	688000	well, they're all just theories, opinions.
688000	693000	And in this democratic age, one person's opinion is as good as another.
693000	696000	Or as someone commented on one of my climate change videos,
696000	701000	there are no facts in observable science, just data and interpretation.
701000	706000	So you've got the evolutionist worldview and the creationist worldview.
706000	710000	Yeah, you've got evolution and creation, two basic worldviews.
710000	711000	You know what the fight is about?
711000	715000	How you interpret the facts, and how you interpret the facts depends upon what?
715000	717000	The beliefs that you have to start with.
717000	720000	Well, it's true for me. You see, I believe...
720000	722000	You mean true for you is different from true for anybody else.
722000	723000	Yeah, absolutely.
723000	728000	I've got very good at anticipating the kind of posts I'll get in response from critics of my videos,
728000	732000	so let me save you the trouble of writing by giving my reply.
732000	735000	It's easy to attack weak arguments like these.
735000	738000	Why don't you address the real problems with climate change,
738000	741000	like the fact that the Himalayan glaciers aren't melting?
741000	746000	Or, to put it in the way it's usually phrased, you stupid pompous dickhead.
746000	749000	Firstly, of course I have addressed these issues.
749000	755000	I've made over 20 videos debunking most of the big myths about climate change, so check them out.
755000	758000	Secondly, these myths are quite easy to debunk
758000	763000	because they nearly all claim to be based on real graphs and papers that can be checked.
763000	769000	A simple comparison shows how their sources have been misinterpreted, misquoted or manipulated.
769000	772000	It's the feelings that are much harder to debunk
772000	775000	because they're not based on anything but thought bubbles.
775000	781000	First of all, they started with global warming because they wanted to focus on CO2.
781000	786000	And then when they realised that the global temperature was going down since 2000,
786000	790000	even though CO2 continued to rise, they moved to goalposts.
790000	792000	And this is one of the things that's a giveaway.
792000	795000	And they started talking about climate change.
795000	801000	Now of course you and I know that the term climate change has been around since at least the Kyoto Protocol of 1997,
801000	806000	and at least since the 1980s when the IPCC was formed,
806000	812000	and at least since the 1970s and the 1960s and the 1950s,
812000	817000	when papers were being written about the link between CO2 and climate change.
817000	823000	So we know the term climate change was used before, during and after the term global warming was coined
823000	827000	to describe one particular aspect of climate change.
827000	832000	Yes, we know that. But remember in the feely world, feelings override observation.
832000	836000	If Timbal was able to show a source for his claim, then that would be easy.
836000	839000	We could just check the source and show him he's wrong.
839000	844000	But if he feels something so strongly that the existence of these papers is impossible,
844000	847000	then how will you ever convince him otherwise?
847000	851000	Instead of name calling, you should blah blah blah blah blah whatever.
851000	854000	I think I've been very polite in my climate change series.
854000	858000	If you don't like the word feely, then by all means suggest another word
858000	863000	to describe someone who derives a conclusion from feelings rather than facts and figures.
863000	868000	I just found that description a bit wordy to keep repeating, so feely is easier.
868000	871000	And if the feelys can suggest a better name for themselves,
871000	877000	at the same time please explain why you think feelings and beliefs should override observation and measurement.
877000	879000	Should be interesting.
879000	885000	Evolution, climate change, is also just a feeling, a belief, a hoax.
885000	889000	Well if you were thinking of posting this, take a look at the video again.
889000	894000	There's a difference between feeling and guessing and observing and measuring.
894000	899000	Every observation can be measured and every measurement is an observation.
900000	904000	Perhaps we're just not doing a very good job of teaching science in schools,
904000	910000	at least a basic understanding of scientific terms like facts, hypotheses and theories,
910000	913000	and an ability to think rather than feel.
913000	914000	Can I get you guys to sign a petition?
914000	915000	What for?
915000	918000	For banning dihydrogen monoxide.
918000	919000	Oh yeah, I'll sign that.
919000	920000	Thank you very much.
924000	927000	And our petition woman was getting signatures left and right.
927000	932000	Okay, mostly left. But ma'am, there's a lot of people against that evil water.
932000	934000	It's everywhere and we just really need to ban it.
934000	935000	Two more supporters.
935000	940000	These passionate, informed people didn't even need to ask what dihydrogen monoxide is.
940000	942000	They didn't even ask.
942000	948000	Perhaps the answer is to give all of those who think they're being conned by scientists the opportunity to separate,
948000	955000	to govern themselves in a world where an understanding of nature is ruled by feelings rather than science.
955000	960000	They could return to the Middle Ages when things were true if they were obvious or common sense,
960000	963000	to a time of wooden boats and bloodletting.
963000	970000	No vaccines in Philandia. Children would be free to develop all those diseases the rest of us will be immunised against.
970000	976000	Answers in school exams would always be marked correct as long as a student felt that the answer was true.
976000	982000	Physics classes could be replaced with finger painting. Churches could take the place of hospitals.
982000	985000	Government policy would be run by astrologers.
985000	990000	It would be an interesting mix because we'd have people like John Shimkus and Bill O'Reilly
990000	996000	sharing their feelings with people like Denis Kucinich and New Age environmentalists.
996000	998000	And this would be their national anthem.
