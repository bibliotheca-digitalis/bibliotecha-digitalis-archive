00:00.000 --> 00:04.000
By now I've dealt with most of the big internet myths about climate change.

00:04.000 --> 00:08.000
I've tracked down their sources and shown, by simple comparison,

00:08.000 --> 00:12.000
that the sources have nearly always been misinterpreted.

00:12.000 --> 00:16.000
Papers don't say what the myth-makers claim they say,

00:16.000 --> 00:19.000
or important conclusions have been left out altogether.

00:19.000 --> 00:23.000
Quotes have been misquoted or fabricated, and graphs have been altered.

00:23.000 --> 00:27.000
The scale of the consequences of climate change have often been exaggerated,

00:27.000 --> 00:29.000
and the time scales contracted.

00:29.000 --> 00:33.000
But what about the internet myths for which there's no source?

00:33.000 --> 00:35.000
They're just...

00:35.000 --> 00:38.000
Well, let's start with the first one, and you can see for yourselves.

00:38.000 --> 00:43.000
Why do we suppose that carbon dioxide is responsible for our changing climate?

00:45.000 --> 00:49.000
CO2 forms only a very small part of the Earth's atmosphere.

00:49.000 --> 00:53.000
Do you happen to know what percentage of the atmosphere is carbon dioxide?

00:53.000 --> 00:57.000
This tiny little sliver is carbon dioxide.

00:57.000 --> 01:02.000
It comprises only about one twenty-five hundredth of the atmosphere.

01:02.000 --> 01:06.000
Only four percent of our greenhouse gas is carbon dioxide.

01:06.000 --> 01:09.000
It's an incredibly small portion.

01:09.000 --> 01:13.000
Carbon dioxide is only a tiny trace gas in the atmosphere.

01:13.000 --> 01:23.000
CO2 now occupies, get this, one ten-thousandth more of the atmosphere than it did in 1750.

01:23.000 --> 01:26.000
Now there's one thing all of these claims have in common.

01:26.000 --> 01:31.000
Okay, they're all made by people who aren't climate researchers, but that's not it.

01:31.000 --> 01:34.000
What they have in common is that none of them gives a conclusion

01:34.000 --> 01:39.000
based on any kind of experiment or observation or measurement or calculation.

01:39.000 --> 01:46.000
They simply feel that because CO2 makes up what Durkin calls a very small part of the atmosphere,

01:46.000 --> 01:52.000
or as Tim Ball calls it, incredibly small, or tiny according to John Coleman,

01:52.000 --> 01:56.000
that it must therefore only exert a tiny influence on climate.

01:56.000 --> 02:00.000
In other words, they're basing their conclusions on just one thing.

02:00.000 --> 02:03.000
They're relying on feeling.

02:03.000 --> 02:07.000
Yes, to counter those elitist scientists and their observations and measurements we have

02:07.000 --> 02:10.000
nothing more than feeling,

02:10.000 --> 02:15.000
which is why Durkin's argument wasn't an experiment or a measurement or a calculation.

02:15.000 --> 02:17.000
It was a question he never answered.

02:17.000 --> 02:22.000
Why do we suppose that carbon dioxide is responsible for our changing climate?

02:22.000 --> 02:26.000
It's a good question, and of course the answer can be found in thousands of scientific papers

02:26.000 --> 02:30.000
that have been written on the subject over the last 120 years.

02:30.000 --> 02:33.000
But for some reason Durkin didn't answer his own question.

02:33.000 --> 02:39.000
He simply appealed to our gut instinct by giving us his feeling and Tim Ball's feeling

02:39.000 --> 02:43.000
that if something's tiny, it would surely have a tiny effect.

02:44.000 --> 02:49.000
Now I do agree that this feeling method of scientific inquiry is much easier.

02:49.000 --> 02:52.000
It doesn't require any research or any difficult calculations,

02:52.000 --> 02:56.000
or any knowledge of physics, or expensive lab equipment.

02:56.000 --> 03:00.000
You don't need to spend years studying or reading the scientific literature,

03:00.000 --> 03:05.000
or trying to understand those fancy graphs that only elitist scientists seem to understand.

03:05.000 --> 03:11.000
All you need in order to come up with what's known in feeling world as a theory is the following.

03:11.000 --> 03:13.000
An armchair?

03:14.000 --> 03:18.000
Once you're sitting comfortably in the armchair, just wait till a thought bubble appears

03:18.000 --> 03:20.000
and you've instantly got a theory.

03:20.000 --> 03:24.000
See, none of that messy experimenting or years of data collecting

03:24.000 --> 03:27.000
or complicated calculating is even necessary.

03:27.000 --> 03:33.000
Now you can make your own graph based on what you feel is obvious, completely devoid of figures,

03:33.000 --> 03:36.000
like this one from the International Journal of Feelings

03:36.000 --> 03:40.000
that compares the amount of stuff with the effect of that stuff.

03:41.000 --> 03:45.000
And instantly we see that heaps of stuff leads to a humongous effect,

03:45.000 --> 03:49.000
while a tiny amount of stuff leads to a teeny weeny effect.

03:49.000 --> 03:51.000
It's just common sense.

03:51.000 --> 03:56.000
But of course for everyone who explains this very obvious feeling that CO2 is so teeny weeny

03:56.000 --> 04:01.000
that it can't have any effect, there's some know-it-all who's going to contradict him.

04:01.000 --> 04:04.000
In this case, it's Mr Monkton.

04:04.000 --> 04:07.000
Carbon dioxide is a plant food, it's necessary.

04:07.000 --> 04:09.000
Plant food.

04:09.000 --> 04:14.000
Yeah. Without it, all plant life and therefore all life that depends on it would disappear.

04:14.000 --> 04:17.000
While the Monkton who says CO2 is hugely important

04:17.000 --> 04:20.000
argues it out with the Monkton who claims it's negligible,

04:20.000 --> 04:25.000
let me take the side of Mr Monkton, by which I mean this one.

04:25.000 --> 04:29.000
According to the Biology textbooks, he's absolutely right.

04:29.000 --> 04:34.000
All plant life depends on CO2, and nearly all animal life depends on plant life.

04:34.000 --> 04:37.000
Yet it's amazing that the same people who argue that this

04:37.000 --> 04:43.000
small part, tiny little sliver, incredibly small fraction of a percent of the Earth's atmosphere

04:43.000 --> 04:46.000
is too negligible to have any impact,

04:46.000 --> 04:49.000
also accept that it's responsible for nearly all life on Earth.

04:49.000 --> 04:56.000
0.054%. It's less than half of one percent.

04:56.000 --> 04:58.000
Yeah.

04:58.000 --> 04:59.000
Unbelievable, isn't it?

04:59.000 --> 05:00.000
Yeah.

05:00.000 --> 05:02.000
You would think that it's absolutely frantic.

05:03.000 --> 05:08.000
No, no, no. This is like millions and millions and millions and millions of years.

05:08.000 --> 05:11.000
This is not good science.

05:11.000 --> 05:16.000
CO2 makes plants grow, and that is a good thing.

05:16.000 --> 05:19.000
What this tells us, as we'll see throughout this video,

05:19.000 --> 05:23.000
is that feelings not only override scientific observation and measurement,

05:23.000 --> 05:27.000
they even override observations by the feelings themselves.

05:27.000 --> 05:31.000
The natural world is full of examples of trace amounts having huge effects.

05:31.000 --> 05:36.000
Ozone in the stratosphere makes up a smaller proportion of the atmosphere than CO2,

05:36.000 --> 05:41.000
but without it we'd receive lethal doses of ultraviolet radiation.

05:41.000 --> 05:46.000
It's a shame we can't actually see carbon dioxide blocking outgoing radiation,

05:46.000 --> 05:49.000
because even people who don't understand the numbers and calculations

05:49.000 --> 05:52.000
would have a very graphic idea of what's happening.

05:52.000 --> 05:58.000
Here's Dan Miller demonstrating with ink what 280 parts per million looks like.

05:58.000 --> 06:02.000
That's the same concentration as pre-industrial CO2.

06:02.000 --> 06:06.000
And then 390 parts per million, the concentration today.

06:06.000 --> 06:10.000
Small things can indeed have big effects.

06:10.000 --> 06:14.000
So if there's one thing that separates the scientists from the junk science feely,

06:14.000 --> 06:20.000
it's the battle of observation, measurement and calculation against feelings, belief and guesswork.

06:20.000 --> 06:26.000
Here, for example, is Congressman John Shimkus explaining during a congressional hearing on climate change

06:26.000 --> 06:30.000
why 120 years of physics must be wrong.

06:30.000 --> 06:35.000
Genesis 8, verse 21 and 22.

06:35.000 --> 06:38.000
Never again will I curse the ground because of man,

06:38.000 --> 06:41.000
even though every inclination of his heart is evil from childhood,

06:41.000 --> 06:45.000
and never again will I destroy all living creatures as I have done.

06:45.000 --> 06:52.000
As long as the earth endures, seedtime and harvest, cold and heat, summer and winter,

06:52.000 --> 06:55.000
day and night will never cease.

06:55.000 --> 06:59.000
The earth will end only when God declares it's time to be over.

06:59.000 --> 07:05.000
Man will not destroy this earth. This earth will not be destroyed by a flood.

07:05.000 --> 07:09.000
Well, that's very good news. But what's that got to do with climate change?

07:09.000 --> 07:12.000
God will never destroy the earth or all living creatures,

07:12.000 --> 07:16.000
but there's nothing in the Bible that says God won't prevent the climate from changing

07:16.000 --> 07:21.000
any more than he seems inclined to prevent earthquakes, melting glaciers and deforestation.

07:21.000 --> 07:24.000
You know, God's still up there. We're now going through a cooling spell.

07:24.000 --> 07:29.000
No, I'm not going to argue about whether God's up there or whether the Bible is infallible

07:29.000 --> 07:32.000
because it makes absolutely no difference in this case.

07:32.000 --> 07:36.000
There's nothing in the Bible that says the climate won't change

07:36.000 --> 07:39.000
and no sign that God won't allow the climate to change.

07:39.000 --> 07:44.000
And Shimkus's feeling that climate change implies the end of the world or a global flood

07:44.000 --> 07:48.000
or the extinction of all life is just that, a feeling.

07:48.000 --> 07:51.000
It's a feeling shared by a lot of environmental activists,

07:51.000 --> 07:56.000
one of whom left a post on my channel insisting that the oceans were going to boil.

07:56.000 --> 07:59.000
I'm going to examine the origin of this myth in a future video,

07:59.000 --> 08:03.000
but of course nothing supports it in the scientific literature.

08:03.000 --> 08:06.000
What strange bedfellows these feelies make.

08:06.000 --> 08:09.000
I'd like to speak to you about global warming

08:09.000 --> 08:15.000
and about what we all can do to make an impact to help protect our planet and save our planet.

08:15.000 --> 08:17.000
Once again, there's nothing in the published research,

08:18.000 --> 08:21.000
you know, where the results of experiments and measurements are shown,

08:21.000 --> 08:26.000
that says climate change will destroy the Earth or flood the Earth or extinguish all life.

08:28.000 --> 08:29.000
And finally, this.

08:29.000 --> 08:33.000
To think that we could affect weather all that much is pretty arrogant.

08:33.000 --> 08:38.000
It's really arrogant for mankind to think he controls the climate of the universe.

08:38.000 --> 08:39.000
That's right.

08:39.000 --> 08:44.000
Carbon dioxide can't have any effect on the climate because that would be arrogant.

08:44.000 --> 08:46.000
Now that may sound like scientific twaddle,

08:46.000 --> 08:51.000
but in the feely world it's cutting-edge, unassailable belief.

08:51.000 --> 08:52.000
And they can prove it.

08:52.000 --> 08:57.000
If we look at another feely graph of global phenomena against lack of humility,

08:57.000 --> 09:01.000
we can see that doubling carbon dioxide levels is much higher up the scale

09:01.000 --> 09:05.000
than the idea that we're polluting the oceans, which is merely self-inflated,

09:05.000 --> 09:11.000
or the assumption that we're destroying tropical rainforests, which achieves the level of haughty.

09:11.000 --> 09:16.000
The more humble the feeling, the more likely it is that a phenomenon is occurring.

09:16.000 --> 09:19.000
By the way, Charlton Heston seems to think that changing the climate

09:19.000 --> 09:23.000
should be at the very top of the scale, intoxicating vanity.

09:23.000 --> 09:26.000
You think man can destroy the planet.

09:26.000 --> 09:28.000
What intoxicating vanity.

09:28.000 --> 09:34.000
But like Kucinich and Shimkus, he's obviously confused climate change with destruction of the planet.

09:34.000 --> 09:37.000
Sorry Chuck, but just look back in geological history

09:37.000 --> 09:41.000
and you'll see that altering the climate doesn't make the Earth blow up.

09:41.000 --> 09:43.000
Even Shimkus can confirm that.

09:43.000 --> 09:47.000
Today we have about 388 parts per million in the atmosphere.

09:47.000 --> 09:50.000
I think in the age of the dinosaurs where we had most flora and fauna,

09:50.000 --> 09:53.000
we were probably at 4,000 parts per million.

09:53.000 --> 09:56.000
OK, apart from the fact that it was more like 1,000 parts per million,

09:56.000 --> 10:01.000
and apart from the rather dubious claim that there was more flora and fauna during the dinosaur era

10:01.000 --> 10:03.000
than at any other time,

10:03.000 --> 10:07.000
Shimkus is at least right about there being a lot more CO2 back then,

10:07.000 --> 10:10.000
about three times as much as today.

10:10.000 --> 10:13.000
And consequently, it was much hotter.

10:13.000 --> 10:16.000
And consequently, there was no ice at the poles.

10:16.000 --> 10:21.000
And consequently, the sea level was about 500 metres higher than today.

10:21.000 --> 10:24.000
Not sure how that helps your case, John.

10:24.000 --> 10:28.000
The predominance of feelings to explain the world around us is nothing new.

10:28.000 --> 10:33.000
In the Middle Ages, doctors felt that bleeding a patient would get rid of sickness.

10:33.000 --> 10:38.000
Medieval scholars felt that there must be some mysterious substance inside combustible material

10:38.000 --> 10:41.000
that caused them to burst into flames.

10:41.000 --> 10:42.000
It was obvious.

10:42.000 --> 10:47.000
And of course it was just common sense that boats made out of metal wouldn't float,

10:47.000 --> 10:51.000
heavy objects fell faster than light ones, and the Sun orbited the Earth.

10:51.000 --> 10:56.000
But in the 17th century, observation and inference quickly established themselves

10:56.000 --> 10:59.000
as the best way to understand the world around us.

10:59.000 --> 11:04.000
People began to do experiments and measure things and make calculations.

11:04.000 --> 11:10.000
Today, no scientist would be taken seriously if he just sat in an armchair dreaming up ideas,

11:10.000 --> 11:13.000
guessing at how he felt the world worked.

11:13.000 --> 11:18.000
But in the Internet age, where everyone gets to comment and everyone has an opinion,

11:18.000 --> 11:21.000
that's how people seem to think science works.

11:21.000 --> 11:25.000
The theory of evolution, plate tectonic theory, and heliocentric theory,

11:25.000 --> 11:28.000
well, they're all just theories, opinions.

11:28.000 --> 11:33.000
And in this democratic age, one person's opinion is as good as another.

11:33.000 --> 11:36.000
Or as someone commented on one of my climate change videos,

11:36.000 --> 11:41.000
there are no facts in observable science, just data and interpretation.

11:41.000 --> 11:46.000
So you've got the evolutionist worldview and the creationist worldview.

11:46.000 --> 11:50.000
Yeah, you've got evolution and creation, two basic worldviews.

11:50.000 --> 11:51.000
You know what the fight is about?

11:51.000 --> 11:55.000
How you interpret the facts, and how you interpret the facts depends upon what?

11:55.000 --> 11:57.000
The beliefs that you have to start with.

11:57.000 --> 12:00.000
Well, it's true for me. You see, I believe...

12:00.000 --> 12:02.000
You mean true for you is different from true for anybody else.

12:02.000 --> 12:03.000
Yeah, absolutely.

12:03.000 --> 12:08.000
I've got very good at anticipating the kind of posts I'll get in response from critics of my videos,

12:08.000 --> 12:12.000
so let me save you the trouble of writing by giving my reply.

12:12.000 --> 12:15.000
It's easy to attack weak arguments like these.

12:15.000 --> 12:18.000
Why don't you address the real problems with climate change,

12:18.000 --> 12:21.000
like the fact that the Himalayan glaciers aren't melting?

12:21.000 --> 12:26.000
Or, to put it in the way it's usually phrased, you stupid pompous dickhead.

12:26.000 --> 12:29.000
Firstly, of course I have addressed these issues.

12:29.000 --> 12:35.000
I've made over 20 videos debunking most of the big myths about climate change, so check them out.

12:35.000 --> 12:38.000
Secondly, these myths are quite easy to debunk

12:38.000 --> 12:43.000
because they nearly all claim to be based on real graphs and papers that can be checked.

12:43.000 --> 12:49.000
A simple comparison shows how their sources have been misinterpreted, misquoted or manipulated.

12:49.000 --> 12:52.000
It's the feelings that are much harder to debunk

12:52.000 --> 12:55.000
because they're not based on anything but thought bubbles.

12:55.000 --> 13:01.000
First of all, they started with global warming because they wanted to focus on CO2.

13:01.000 --> 13:06.000
And then when they realised that the global temperature was going down since 2000,

13:06.000 --> 13:10.000
even though CO2 continued to rise, they moved to goalposts.

13:10.000 --> 13:12.000
And this is one of the things that's a giveaway.

13:12.000 --> 13:15.000
And they started talking about climate change.

13:15.000 --> 13:21.000
Now of course you and I know that the term climate change has been around since at least the Kyoto Protocol of 1997,

13:21.000 --> 13:26.000
and at least since the 1980s when the IPCC was formed,

13:26.000 --> 13:32.000
and at least since the 1970s and the 1960s and the 1950s,

13:32.000 --> 13:37.000
when papers were being written about the link between CO2 and climate change.

13:37.000 --> 13:43.000
So we know the term climate change was used before, during and after the term global warming was coined

13:43.000 --> 13:47.000
to describe one particular aspect of climate change.

13:47.000 --> 13:52.000
Yes, we know that. But remember in the feely world, feelings override observation.

13:52.000 --> 13:56.000
If Timbal was able to show a source for his claim, then that would be easy.

13:56.000 --> 13:59.000
We could just check the source and show him he's wrong.

13:59.000 --> 14:04.000
But if he feels something so strongly that the existence of these papers is impossible,

14:04.000 --> 14:07.000
then how will you ever convince him otherwise?

14:07.000 --> 14:11.000
Instead of name calling, you should blah blah blah blah blah whatever.

14:11.000 --> 14:14.000
I think I've been very polite in my climate change series.

14:14.000 --> 14:18.000
If you don't like the word feely, then by all means suggest another word

14:18.000 --> 14:23.000
to describe someone who derives a conclusion from feelings rather than facts and figures.

14:23.000 --> 14:28.000
I just found that description a bit wordy to keep repeating, so feely is easier.

14:28.000 --> 14:31.000
And if the feelys can suggest a better name for themselves,

14:31.000 --> 14:37.000
at the same time please explain why you think feelings and beliefs should override observation and measurement.

14:37.000 --> 14:39.000
Should be interesting.

14:39.000 --> 14:45.000
Evolution, climate change, is also just a feeling, a belief, a hoax.

14:45.000 --> 14:49.000
Well if you were thinking of posting this, take a look at the video again.

14:49.000 --> 14:54.000
There's a difference between feeling and guessing and observing and measuring.

14:54.000 --> 14:59.000
Every observation can be measured and every measurement is an observation.

15:00.000 --> 15:04.000
Perhaps we're just not doing a very good job of teaching science in schools,

15:04.000 --> 15:10.000
at least a basic understanding of scientific terms like facts, hypotheses and theories,

15:10.000 --> 15:13.000
and an ability to think rather than feel.

15:13.000 --> 15:14.000
Can I get you guys to sign a petition?

15:14.000 --> 15:15.000
What for?

15:15.000 --> 15:18.000
For banning dihydrogen monoxide.

15:18.000 --> 15:19.000
Oh yeah, I'll sign that.

15:19.000 --> 15:20.000
Thank you very much.

15:24.000 --> 15:27.000
And our petition woman was getting signatures left and right.

15:27.000 --> 15:32.000
Okay, mostly left. But ma'am, there's a lot of people against that evil water.

15:32.000 --> 15:34.000
It's everywhere and we just really need to ban it.

15:34.000 --> 15:35.000
Two more supporters.

15:35.000 --> 15:40.000
These passionate, informed people didn't even need to ask what dihydrogen monoxide is.

15:40.000 --> 15:42.000
They didn't even ask.

15:42.000 --> 15:48.000
Perhaps the answer is to give all of those who think they're being conned by scientists the opportunity to separate,

15:48.000 --> 15:55.000
to govern themselves in a world where an understanding of nature is ruled by feelings rather than science.

15:55.000 --> 16:00.000
They could return to the Middle Ages when things were true if they were obvious or common sense,

16:00.000 --> 16:03.000
to a time of wooden boats and bloodletting.

16:03.000 --> 16:10.000
No vaccines in Philandia. Children would be free to develop all those diseases the rest of us will be immunised against.

16:10.000 --> 16:16.000
Answers in school exams would always be marked correct as long as a student felt that the answer was true.

16:16.000 --> 16:22.000
Physics classes could be replaced with finger painting. Churches could take the place of hospitals.

16:22.000 --> 16:25.000
Government policy would be run by astrologers.

16:25.000 --> 16:30.000
It would be an interesting mix because we'd have people like John Shimkus and Bill O'Reilly

16:30.000 --> 16:36.000
sharing their feelings with people like Denis Kucinich and New Age environmentalists.

16:36.000 --> 16:38.000
And this would be their national anthem.
