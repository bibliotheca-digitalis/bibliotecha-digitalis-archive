1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
How much CO2 is up there anyway?

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:09,000
Alright, so you know it's 0.03%

3
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:13,000
and of that, 4% of that is due to man.

4
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:18,000
Hang on, only 4% of the CO2 in the atmosphere is due to man?

5
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:20,000
Then what are we worrying about?

6
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:23,000
Even if we halve the amount of CO2 we produce,

7
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:28,000
it would barely make any difference if 96% is produced by nature.

8
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:32,000
Of course that depends on Piers Corbin being correct.

9
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,000
Do we have any confirmation of that?

10
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:36,000
Yes, sort of.

11
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:43,000
Human activity is maybe 3% contributing to the 3% of carbon dioxide

12
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:45,000
that's in Earth's atmosphere.

13
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:51,000
It's so negligible, it's a fraction of a fraction of a fraction of a percent.

14
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:54,000
OK, not 4% but 3% either way.

15
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:57,000
When I did my video on Steven Crowder last month,

16
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:00,000
this is the claim I actually wanted to take apart.

17
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
It's on his blog.

18
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:06,000
Most of the rise in CO2 is coming from natural sources.

19
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:11,000
But for some reason it didn't make it from Crowder's blog to his video.

20
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:12,000
What's his source?

21
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:18,000
It turns out there's only one and of course it's a blog by someone called Ed Carroll.

22
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:22,000
Before we try to verify what Carroll is claiming, here's some background.

23
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:28,000
Carbon dioxide concentration in the atmosphere has been pretty steady for over 2000 years.

24
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:34,000
And about the time the Industrial Revolution started, when we began burning coal, it started to rise.

25
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:40,000
And when we started burning oil, it rose more and more again as the whole world industrialised.

26
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:47,000
In fact, CO2 has been rising pretty consistently with our increased production of CO2.

27
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:52,000
Carroll argues that the extra carbon dioxide is not coming from burning coal and oil.

28
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:55,000
It's being degassed from the ocean.

29
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:59,000
Sea surface temperature seems to be driving atmospheric CO2 changes.

30
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:04,000
This makes sense because CO2's solubility in seawater is temperature dependent.

31
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:10,000
His argument is that the sun causes warming and this has caused the oceans to warm.

32
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:15,000
And as we know from basic physics, carbon dioxide is more soluble in colder water,

33
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:19,000
so as the oceans warm, they release carbon dioxide.

34
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:26,000
So he says this explains why the oceans are warming and it explains why there's been an increase in carbon dioxide.

35
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:31,000
Sounds convincing. So what is it Carroll is concealing?

36
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:37,000
Well, one thing is that solar output hasn't been increasing over the last 50 years.

37
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:42,000
It's been getting weaker. So something else must be causing the oceans to warm.

38
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:48,000
Secondly, the oceans haven't been degassing carbon dioxide. They've been absorbing it.

39
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:54,000
So the two pillars on which Carroll's model is based are simply wrong.

40
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:58,000
But this article by Ed Carroll isn't the source of all the claims on the internet

41
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:04,000
about anthropogenic sources being 3% or 4% of carbon dioxide in our atmosphere.

42
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:11,000
I did a Google search going back 10 years and the myth goes back much further than Carroll's article.

43
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:19,000
A lot of them trace back to this 2007 blog by Monty Heeb, which went viral in 2008.

44
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:24,000
The blogger is a former West Virginia office of miners safety engineer.

45
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:29,000
He wrote, human activities contribute slightly to greenhouse gas concentrations

46
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:34,000
but they're dwarfed in comparison to emissions from natural sources.

47
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:40,000
Heeb claims anthropogenic CO2 is just 3.225% of total CO2

48
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,000
and he worked this out from his own table.

49
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:54,000
The anthropogenic component, 11,880ppb, divided by the total CO2 concentration in the atmosphere, 368,400ppb.

50
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:57,000
But where do these figures come from?

51
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:01,000
First of all, Heeb's figure for natural additions is rather odd.

52
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:09,000
If nature is responsible for increasing CO2 concentration by 68,520ppb over the last 200 years,

53
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:16,000
after remaining in balance for over 2,000 years, then where did all this extra CO2 suddenly come from?

54
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:24,000
After all, that represents over half a billion tonnes of carbon dioxide suddenly erupting from the oceans and the biosphere,

55
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:33,000
equivalent to about 50,000 Mount St Helens-sized volcanoes, 25,000 of them popping off in the last 40 years.

56
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:37,000
And if most of the increase is due to some mysterious natural cause,

57
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:42,000
then where did all the CO2 from 200 years of fossil fuel burning go?

58
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:49,000
Did nature decide to hide all of our CO2 and substitute it with CO2 from some mysterious source?

59
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:56,000
But the clincher is isotopic evidence that the extra carbon has come from the burning of fossil fuels.

60
00:04:56,000 --> 00:05:01,000
Very little of the carbon in coal and oil contains the isotope carbon-13,

61
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:07,000
whereas the carbon in volcanoes and oceans comprises about 1% carbon-13.

62
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:14,000
So if the extra CO2 is coming from the burning of fossil fuels, rather than volcanoes and ocean degasification,

63
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:18,000
then researchers ought to see the proportion of C-13 go down.

64
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,000
And they do.

65
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:27,000
So Heeb's claim is looking distinctly dodgy from the start, but let's check his sources to be sure.

66
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:33,000
He says the figure for natural additions comes from the Department of Energy, October 2000.

67
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:39,000
But I can't find any such estimate from the DOE for that year or any other year.

68
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:44,000
What the Department of Energy does say is exactly what other researchers say,

69
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:48,000
that there are no net natural additions to the atmosphere.

70
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:53,000
All the carbon that nature puts into the atmosphere gets absorbed back again.

71
00:05:53,000 --> 00:06:02,000
As for the 11,880 parts per billion figure, Heeb says that comes from a 1997 blog by Tom Segelstad.

72
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:10,000
But I've checked, and the blog doesn't give any such figure, or an equivalent like 11.88 parts per million.

73
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:17,000
What I think Heeb's done is confuse accumulated carbon in the atmosphere with carbon flux,

74
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:23,000
because his figure of 3.22% for the anthropogenic component is very close to the 4%

75
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:28,000
that the DOE estimates is the anthropogenic component of carbon flux.

76
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:36,000
So bear with me while I explain this, because in a minute we'll see other bloggers make exactly the same mistake.

77
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:41,000
Every year around 220 billion tonnes of carbon is released into the atmosphere

78
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:49,000
from natural sources like ocean de-gasification, rotting vegetation, soil degradation, volcanic eruptions, and so on.

79
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:56,000
That's been going on for over 2000 years, and now humans are adding over 9 billion tonnes a year

80
00:06:56,000 --> 00:07:01,000
by digging up and burning stuff that was underground, around 4% of the total.

81
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:06,000
By the way, I'm talking carbon here. The weight for carbon dioxide is obviously more.

82
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:10,000
So in a literal sense the bloggers would seem to have it right.

83
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:13,000
Anthropogenic sources hardly make any difference.

84
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:16,000
So what gives?

85
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:19,000
Well, once again the answer isn't rocket science.

86
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:25,000
While rotting vegetation releases carbon, living vegetation grows and takes it back.

87
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:33,000
While some CO2 is de-gassed from the oceans, even more CO2 is being dissolved in the oceans, as I explained earlier.

88
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:39,000
Although carbon is being released by soils, carbon is also being absorbed by soils.

89
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:48,000
And we're lucky enough that volcanic venting of CO2 is roughly balanced by CO2 taken out of the atmosphere through chemical weathering.

90
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:51,000
So it's a two-way street.

91
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:57,000
OK, it's not an exact equation, but it's been pretty much in balance for over 2000 years,

92
00:07:57,000 --> 00:08:01,000
and that's what's kept CO2 levels in the atmosphere stable.

93
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:07,000
So when a whole load of extra CO2 is introduced into the mix, nature can't absorb it all

94
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:10,000
and the system is thrown out of balance.

95
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:17,000
Around half of the carbon we release is absorbed by the oceans in the biosphere, and half accumulates in the atmosphere.

96
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:28,000
So over the last 200 years, it's caused CO2 concentration to go from around 270 ppm to over 400 ppm.

97
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:38,000
As I say, I suspect this is what he's done, because his 3.22% is very close to the 4% of anthropogenic carbon added to the carbon flux.

98
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:41,000
And the difference could be that he's using older figures.

99
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:49,000
Whatever the case, his citation of Department of Energy data is wrong, because the Department of Energy gives completely different figures,

100
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:52,000
and his citing of another blog doesn't bear out.

101
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:56,000
So that's the end of that particular trail.

102
00:08:56,000 --> 00:09:05,000
Then there was another flurry of activity six years later, when bloggers and posters claimed the anthropogenic component is 3.75%.

103
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:11,000
New paper finds only about 3.75% of atmospheric CO2 is man-made from burning of fossil fuels.

104
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:14,000
Only 3.75% of atmospheric CO2 comes from humans.

105
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:18,000
New paper finds only about 3.75% of atmospheric CO2 is man-made from burning of fossil fuels.

106
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:21,000
EPA document supports about 3% of atmospheric carbon dioxide.

107
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:27,000
New paper finds only about 3.75% of atmospheric carbon dioxide.

108
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:32,000
They claim their source is this paper, published in the Journal of Atmospheric Chemistry and Physics.

109
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:36,000
But as we'll see in a minute, the paper made no such conclusion.

110
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:40,000
So how did so many people make exactly the same mistake?

111
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:44,000
Was the paper ambiguous? Badly worded?

112
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:47,000
No, it turns out they didn't read the paper.

113
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:55,000
As so often happens, they read a blog that told them that the paper made this claim, and they didn't bother to verify it.

114
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:59,000
If you click on this link, for example, it doesn't take you to the paper being quoted.

115
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:05,000
It takes you to a blog called The Hockey Stik, run by someone called Tom Nelson.

116
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:11,000
And whatever route you take, direct or indirect, all the claims lead back to Nelson's blog.

117
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:19,000
He seems to be the only one to have read the paper, or at least a part of it, and he completely misunderstood what it was saying.

118
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:27,000
The authors examine how radiation from nuclear power plants in Europe can affect the ratio of carbon isotopes in the atmosphere.

119
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:35,000
Nelson read in the abstract that fossil fuel CO2 in the lower 1200m of the atmosphere are close to 15ppm.

120
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:48,000
And without bothering to read or understand the rest of the paper, he immediately worked out that 15ppm out of a total CO2 concentration of around 400ppm equals 3.75%.

121
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:51,000
So that became his headline.

122
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:54,000
Before I go on, here's a piece of advice Tom.

123
00:10:54,000 --> 00:11:00,000
If nearly every scientific study concludes that about a third of CO2 in the atmosphere is anthropogenic,

124
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:05,000
and a group of researchers discovers that the actual figure is one-eighth of that,

125
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:09,000
they wouldn't mention it in passing in a paper titled

126
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:15,000
Simulating the Integrated Summertime CO2 Signature from Anthropogenic Emissions over Western Europe.

127
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:19,000
That's what's known in my business as burying the lead.

128
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:22,000
They'd shout it out loud in a paper titled

129
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:29,000
Anthropogenic CO2 Comprises Only 3.75% of Atmospheric CO2 and Hope for a Nobel Prize.

130
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:36,000
So that should have been your first clue that perhaps the paper doesn't say what you think it says.

131
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:38,000
So where did Nelson go wrong?

132
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:41,000
Well, it's not hard to figure out.

133
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:46,000
The 15ppm figure he seized on wasn't referring to accumulated CO2 content.

134
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:52,000
Once again, it was referring to carbon dioxide flux, which I explained earlier.

135
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:58,000
This concept seems so hard for bloggers to grasp that I'll try to explain it with an analogy.

136
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:04,000
Think of the carbon cycle as water circulating in an open tank with a plate across the middle.

137
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:10,000
The tank holds 1000 litres, 500 in the top chamber and 500 in the bottom.

138
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:14,000
And every day 100 litres of water is pumped into the upper chamber at one end,

139
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:19,000
and at the same time 100 litres a day descends into the lower chamber through a valve.

140
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:22,000
What happens to the level of water?

141
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:25,000
Nothing. It stays pretty much the same.

142
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:28,000
This is our carbon cycle.

143
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:34,000
Now let's introduce some extra water into the upper chamber, which is our atmosphere, from a completely new source.

144
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:41,000
Every day we'll add 2 litres of water, representing the 2% of anthropogenic carbon that isn't taken up by the carbon sink.

145
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:43,000
And what happens?

146
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:46,000
The level of the water goes up.

147
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:48,000
The amount being added isn't much.

148
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:51,000
It's only 2% of our total flux, after all.

149
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:58,000
But it accumulates, and after 100 days there's an extra 200 litres in the tank.

150
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:03,000
That represents two fifths of all the water in our upper tank, the atmosphere.

151
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:07,000
So we now have two figures representing the water we've introduced.

152
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:13,000
One figure is 2%, comparing our newly introduced water to the amount of water in circulation.

153
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:21,000
The other is 40%, comparing the amount of this newly introduced water to the total amount of water in the upper tank.

154
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:26,000
At the risk of labouring the point, our bloggers have confused these two figures.

155
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:32,000
I hope the science is clear, but I'm sure a lot of people will still prefer to believe the hockey stick.

156
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:34,000
So here's the twist.

157
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:40,000
The authors of the ACP paper learned how their study was being misinterpreted around the internet,

158
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:43,000
and they also traced the myth back to the hockey stick.

159
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:47,000
They contacted Tom Nelson and told him he'd got it wrong.

160
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:52,000
Researchers have occasionally done that in the past with little effect,

161
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:57,000
but in this case, to his credit, Tom Nelson understood and issued a retraction.

162
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:02,000
Unfortunately, the bloggers who copied from the hockey stick were less forthcoming.

163
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:08,000
Jonathan Duhamel, who runs the Rye Heat blog, picked up on the hockey stick's retraction,

164
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:13,000
but claimed Nelson had taken the site down because of pressure from the paper's authors.

165
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:17,000
Even where he hints that this was in fact due to an error by Nelson,

166
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:21,000
he blames the authors for not saying what they mean.

167
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:26,000
And then Duhamel announces that Nelson didn't get it wrong after all.

168
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:30,000
The contention made by hockey stick seems to be supported by old table

169
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:34,000
from the Energy Information Administration, which shows the same thing.

170
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:40,000
Only about 3% of atmospheric carbon dioxide is attributable to human sources.

171
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:42,000
Look at the table and do the arithmetic.

172
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:48,000
23,100 divided by 793,100 equals 0.029.

173
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:55,000
Well, the math is right, but once again in the caption it explains that this is carbon dioxide flux.

174
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:59,000
This is exactly the same mistake that Nelson made earlier in the hockey stick,

175
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:05,000
and that Duhamel copied, mistaking CO2 flux for accumulated CO2.

176
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:09,000
And blow-me-down, the lead author of the misquoted paper,

177
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:14,000
Denika Boshinova, again had to intervene to explain the mistake.

178
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:21,000
In reply, she was given a fact by Duhamel that only 3% of CO2 in the atmosphere is due to humans.

179
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:24,000
This should be interesting.

180
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:26,000
Boshinova tried to explain.

181
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:29,000
Duhamel said, I don't understand your comment.

182
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:32,000
What else but gross fluxes is worth looking at?

183
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:39,000
There follows a long series of remedial lessons in basic climatology, which Duhamel finally begins to grasp.

184
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:43,000
Then he suggests doing something he should have done on day one.

185
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:47,000
I would be interested in reading the whole paper. No kidding.

186
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:49,000
Then this.

187
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:53,000
Many of us do not have access to the full paper, only the abstract.

188
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:58,000
Studies funded by public money should be available to the interested public for free.

189
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:05,000
Nice try, but in fact this paper is available for free. It's in an open access journal.

190
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:12,000
Duhamel could have got his free copy as soon as he saw it being quoted by the hockey stick, just like I did.

191
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:18,000
Then Duhamel complains that scientific papers are full of jargon that's hard to understand.

192
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:25,000
Well John, then perhaps you shouldn't be running a blog telling people the science is wrong based on a paper you didn't read

193
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:29,000
and which you thought is full of hard to understand jargon.

194
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:34,000
Because the problem is, a lot of people assume that bloggers know what they're talking about

195
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:38,000
and blindly copy and paste what you've written without bothering to check it.

196
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:42,000
Case in point, what's up with that?

197
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:46,000
And when it was all shown to be rubbish, Anthony Watts, who runs the blog,

198
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:52,000
made the excuse that, since the original author had worked for the Tucson Citizen, that's Jonathan Duhamel,

199
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:55,000
I made the mistake of assuming it was properly vetted.

200
00:16:55,000 --> 00:17:02,000
Well, of course, as we all know, bloggers who copy other bloggers are well known for having all their claims properly vetted.

201
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:07,000
But let's face it, if the authors of the ACP paper hadn't contacted Tom Nelson,

202
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:14,000
and if he hadn't issued a retraction, Watts would still be under the impression that the right-heat blog was properly vetted,

203
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:17,000
and it would still be on the what's up with that blog.

204
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:24,000
Actually, it is. The only clue that the whole thing is bunkum is a small note here saying it has an error.

205
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:26,000
One error?

206
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:31,000
And you have to scroll down to the update to find out that the error is the entire thing.

207
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:33,000
Maybe, or maybe not.

208
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:38,000
According to this letter from Duhamel, which is also printed in the update, it could be censorship,

209
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:42,000
or duplicitous scientists going back on what they wrote in the paper.

210
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:45,000
Says the man who couldn't understand the paper.

211
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:52,000
Anthony, why not do what Tom Nelson did and cross out the bits of Duhamel's story that were wrong,

212
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:57,000
so that people can still see what was originally written, but they'll understand it was all nonsense.

213
00:17:57,000 --> 00:18:06,000
They won't do what this guy did and copy your what's up with that page a year later without any indication that the whole thing is baloney.

214
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:11,000
I've been warning about the danger of relying on these bloggers for years,

215
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:16,000
but thanks to the recent presidential election, this warning has finally gone mainstream.

216
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:24,000
We've seen fake news stories about the two candidates, and the phrase post-truth applied to the world of social media.

217
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:30,000
But it's not just phony sites that are disseminating fake news, it's far more widespread than that.

218
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:37,000
A blogger makes a mistake, whether intentionally or through sloppy research, or just plain ignorance,

219
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:43,000
his blog is copied by another blogger and copied by another blogger until millions of people believe it.

220
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:49,000
This is fake news being passed around by people who can't be bothered to check it.

221
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:55,000
So you can't trust the people who generate this fake news to get it right or to correct it.

222
00:18:55,000 --> 00:19:02,000
It's up to us to do that, by checking where these stories come from when they land on Twitter or Facebook.

223
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:05,000
And it's not always from Macedonia.
