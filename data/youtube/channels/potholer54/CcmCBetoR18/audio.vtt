00:00.000 --> 00:05.000
How much CO2 is up there anyway?

00:05.000 --> 00:09.000
Alright, so you know it's 0.03%

00:09.000 --> 00:13.000
and of that, 4% of that is due to man.

00:13.000 --> 00:18.000
Hang on, only 4% of the CO2 in the atmosphere is due to man?

00:18.000 --> 00:20.000
Then what are we worrying about?

00:20.000 --> 00:23.000
Even if we halve the amount of CO2 we produce,

00:23.000 --> 00:28.000
it would barely make any difference if 96% is produced by nature.

00:28.000 --> 00:32.000
Of course that depends on Piers Corbin being correct.

00:32.000 --> 00:34.000
Do we have any confirmation of that?

00:34.000 --> 00:36.000
Yes, sort of.

00:36.000 --> 00:43.000
Human activity is maybe 3% contributing to the 3% of carbon dioxide

00:43.000 --> 00:45.000
that's in Earth's atmosphere.

00:45.000 --> 00:51.000
It's so negligible, it's a fraction of a fraction of a fraction of a percent.

00:51.000 --> 00:54.000
OK, not 4% but 3% either way.

00:54.000 --> 00:57.000
When I did my video on Steven Crowder last month,

00:57.000 --> 01:00.000
this is the claim I actually wanted to take apart.

01:00.000 --> 01:02.000
It's on his blog.

01:02.000 --> 01:06.000
Most of the rise in CO2 is coming from natural sources.

01:06.000 --> 01:11.000
But for some reason it didn't make it from Crowder's blog to his video.

01:11.000 --> 01:12.000
What's his source?

01:12.000 --> 01:18.000
It turns out there's only one and of course it's a blog by someone called Ed Carroll.

01:18.000 --> 01:22.000
Before we try to verify what Carroll is claiming, here's some background.

01:22.000 --> 01:28.000
Carbon dioxide concentration in the atmosphere has been pretty steady for over 2000 years.

01:28.000 --> 01:34.000
And about the time the Industrial Revolution started, when we began burning coal, it started to rise.

01:34.000 --> 01:40.000
And when we started burning oil, it rose more and more again as the whole world industrialised.

01:40.000 --> 01:47.000
In fact, CO2 has been rising pretty consistently with our increased production of CO2.

01:47.000 --> 01:52.000
Carroll argues that the extra carbon dioxide is not coming from burning coal and oil.

01:52.000 --> 01:55.000
It's being degassed from the ocean.

01:55.000 --> 01:59.000
Sea surface temperature seems to be driving atmospheric CO2 changes.

01:59.000 --> 02:04.000
This makes sense because CO2's solubility in seawater is temperature dependent.

02:04.000 --> 02:10.000
His argument is that the sun causes warming and this has caused the oceans to warm.

02:10.000 --> 02:15.000
And as we know from basic physics, carbon dioxide is more soluble in colder water,

02:15.000 --> 02:19.000
so as the oceans warm, they release carbon dioxide.

02:19.000 --> 02:26.000
So he says this explains why the oceans are warming and it explains why there's been an increase in carbon dioxide.

02:26.000 --> 02:31.000
Sounds convincing. So what is it Carroll is concealing?

02:31.000 --> 02:37.000
Well, one thing is that solar output hasn't been increasing over the last 50 years.

02:37.000 --> 02:42.000
It's been getting weaker. So something else must be causing the oceans to warm.

02:42.000 --> 02:48.000
Secondly, the oceans haven't been degassing carbon dioxide. They've been absorbing it.

02:48.000 --> 02:54.000
So the two pillars on which Carroll's model is based are simply wrong.

02:54.000 --> 02:58.000
But this article by Ed Carroll isn't the source of all the claims on the internet

02:58.000 --> 03:04.000
about anthropogenic sources being 3% or 4% of carbon dioxide in our atmosphere.

03:04.000 --> 03:11.000
I did a Google search going back 10 years and the myth goes back much further than Carroll's article.

03:11.000 --> 03:19.000
A lot of them trace back to this 2007 blog by Monty Heeb, which went viral in 2008.

03:19.000 --> 03:24.000
The blogger is a former West Virginia office of miners safety engineer.

03:24.000 --> 03:29.000
He wrote, human activities contribute slightly to greenhouse gas concentrations

03:29.000 --> 03:34.000
but they're dwarfed in comparison to emissions from natural sources.

03:34.000 --> 03:40.000
Heeb claims anthropogenic CO2 is just 3.225% of total CO2

03:40.000 --> 03:42.000
and he worked this out from his own table.

03:42.000 --> 03:54.000
The anthropogenic component, 11,880ppb, divided by the total CO2 concentration in the atmosphere, 368,400ppb.

03:54.000 --> 03:57.000
But where do these figures come from?

03:57.000 --> 04:01.000
First of all, Heeb's figure for natural additions is rather odd.

04:01.000 --> 04:09.000
If nature is responsible for increasing CO2 concentration by 68,520ppb over the last 200 years,

04:09.000 --> 04:16.000
after remaining in balance for over 2,000 years, then where did all this extra CO2 suddenly come from?

04:16.000 --> 04:24.000
After all, that represents over half a billion tonnes of carbon dioxide suddenly erupting from the oceans and the biosphere,

04:24.000 --> 04:33.000
equivalent to about 50,000 Mount St Helens-sized volcanoes, 25,000 of them popping off in the last 40 years.

04:33.000 --> 04:37.000
And if most of the increase is due to some mysterious natural cause,

04:37.000 --> 04:42.000
then where did all the CO2 from 200 years of fossil fuel burning go?

04:42.000 --> 04:49.000
Did nature decide to hide all of our CO2 and substitute it with CO2 from some mysterious source?

04:49.000 --> 04:56.000
But the clincher is isotopic evidence that the extra carbon has come from the burning of fossil fuels.

04:56.000 --> 05:01.000
Very little of the carbon in coal and oil contains the isotope carbon-13,

05:01.000 --> 05:07.000
whereas the carbon in volcanoes and oceans comprises about 1% carbon-13.

05:07.000 --> 05:14.000
So if the extra CO2 is coming from the burning of fossil fuels, rather than volcanoes and ocean degasification,

05:14.000 --> 05:18.000
then researchers ought to see the proportion of C-13 go down.

05:18.000 --> 05:20.000
And they do.

05:20.000 --> 05:27.000
So Heeb's claim is looking distinctly dodgy from the start, but let's check his sources to be sure.

05:27.000 --> 05:33.000
He says the figure for natural additions comes from the Department of Energy, October 2000.

05:33.000 --> 05:39.000
But I can't find any such estimate from the DOE for that year or any other year.

05:39.000 --> 05:44.000
What the Department of Energy does say is exactly what other researchers say,

05:44.000 --> 05:48.000
that there are no net natural additions to the atmosphere.

05:48.000 --> 05:53.000
All the carbon that nature puts into the atmosphere gets absorbed back again.

05:53.000 --> 06:02.000
As for the 11,880 parts per billion figure, Heeb says that comes from a 1997 blog by Tom Segelstad.

06:02.000 --> 06:10.000
But I've checked, and the blog doesn't give any such figure, or an equivalent like 11.88 parts per million.

06:10.000 --> 06:17.000
What I think Heeb's done is confuse accumulated carbon in the atmosphere with carbon flux,

06:17.000 --> 06:23.000
because his figure of 3.22% for the anthropogenic component is very close to the 4%

06:23.000 --> 06:28.000
that the DOE estimates is the anthropogenic component of carbon flux.

06:28.000 --> 06:36.000
So bear with me while I explain this, because in a minute we'll see other bloggers make exactly the same mistake.

06:36.000 --> 06:41.000
Every year around 220 billion tonnes of carbon is released into the atmosphere

06:41.000 --> 06:49.000
from natural sources like ocean de-gasification, rotting vegetation, soil degradation, volcanic eruptions, and so on.

06:49.000 --> 06:56.000
That's been going on for over 2000 years, and now humans are adding over 9 billion tonnes a year

06:56.000 --> 07:01.000
by digging up and burning stuff that was underground, around 4% of the total.

07:01.000 --> 07:06.000
By the way, I'm talking carbon here. The weight for carbon dioxide is obviously more.

07:06.000 --> 07:10.000
So in a literal sense the bloggers would seem to have it right.

07:10.000 --> 07:13.000
Anthropogenic sources hardly make any difference.

07:13.000 --> 07:16.000
So what gives?

07:16.000 --> 07:19.000
Well, once again the answer isn't rocket science.

07:19.000 --> 07:25.000
While rotting vegetation releases carbon, living vegetation grows and takes it back.

07:25.000 --> 07:33.000
While some CO2 is de-gassed from the oceans, even more CO2 is being dissolved in the oceans, as I explained earlier.

07:33.000 --> 07:39.000
Although carbon is being released by soils, carbon is also being absorbed by soils.

07:39.000 --> 07:48.000
And we're lucky enough that volcanic venting of CO2 is roughly balanced by CO2 taken out of the atmosphere through chemical weathering.

07:48.000 --> 07:51.000
So it's a two-way street.

07:51.000 --> 07:57.000
OK, it's not an exact equation, but it's been pretty much in balance for over 2000 years,

07:57.000 --> 08:01.000
and that's what's kept CO2 levels in the atmosphere stable.

08:01.000 --> 08:07.000
So when a whole load of extra CO2 is introduced into the mix, nature can't absorb it all

08:07.000 --> 08:10.000
and the system is thrown out of balance.

08:10.000 --> 08:17.000
Around half of the carbon we release is absorbed by the oceans in the biosphere, and half accumulates in the atmosphere.

08:17.000 --> 08:28.000
So over the last 200 years, it's caused CO2 concentration to go from around 270 ppm to over 400 ppm.

08:28.000 --> 08:38.000
As I say, I suspect this is what he's done, because his 3.22% is very close to the 4% of anthropogenic carbon added to the carbon flux.

08:38.000 --> 08:41.000
And the difference could be that he's using older figures.

08:41.000 --> 08:49.000
Whatever the case, his citation of Department of Energy data is wrong, because the Department of Energy gives completely different figures,

08:49.000 --> 08:52.000
and his citing of another blog doesn't bear out.

08:52.000 --> 08:56.000
So that's the end of that particular trail.

08:56.000 --> 09:05.000
Then there was another flurry of activity six years later, when bloggers and posters claimed the anthropogenic component is 3.75%.

09:06.000 --> 09:11.000
New paper finds only about 3.75% of atmospheric CO2 is man-made from burning of fossil fuels.

09:11.000 --> 09:14.000
Only 3.75% of atmospheric CO2 comes from humans.

09:14.000 --> 09:18.000
New paper finds only about 3.75% of atmospheric CO2 is man-made from burning of fossil fuels.

09:18.000 --> 09:21.000
EPA document supports about 3% of atmospheric carbon dioxide.

09:21.000 --> 09:27.000
New paper finds only about 3.75% of atmospheric carbon dioxide.

09:27.000 --> 09:32.000
They claim their source is this paper, published in the Journal of Atmospheric Chemistry and Physics.

09:32.000 --> 09:36.000
But as we'll see in a minute, the paper made no such conclusion.

09:36.000 --> 09:40.000
So how did so many people make exactly the same mistake?

09:40.000 --> 09:44.000
Was the paper ambiguous? Badly worded?

09:44.000 --> 09:47.000
No, it turns out they didn't read the paper.

09:47.000 --> 09:55.000
As so often happens, they read a blog that told them that the paper made this claim, and they didn't bother to verify it.

09:55.000 --> 09:59.000
If you click on this link, for example, it doesn't take you to the paper being quoted.

09:59.000 --> 10:05.000
It takes you to a blog called The Hockey Stik, run by someone called Tom Nelson.

10:05.000 --> 10:11.000
And whatever route you take, direct or indirect, all the claims lead back to Nelson's blog.

10:11.000 --> 10:19.000
He seems to be the only one to have read the paper, or at least a part of it, and he completely misunderstood what it was saying.

10:19.000 --> 10:27.000
The authors examine how radiation from nuclear power plants in Europe can affect the ratio of carbon isotopes in the atmosphere.

10:27.000 --> 10:35.000
Nelson read in the abstract that fossil fuel CO2 in the lower 1200m of the atmosphere are close to 15ppm.

10:35.000 --> 10:48.000
And without bothering to read or understand the rest of the paper, he immediately worked out that 15ppm out of a total CO2 concentration of around 400ppm equals 3.75%.

10:48.000 --> 10:51.000
So that became his headline.

10:51.000 --> 10:54.000
Before I go on, here's a piece of advice Tom.

10:54.000 --> 11:00.000
If nearly every scientific study concludes that about a third of CO2 in the atmosphere is anthropogenic,

11:00.000 --> 11:05.000
and a group of researchers discovers that the actual figure is one-eighth of that,

11:05.000 --> 11:09.000
they wouldn't mention it in passing in a paper titled

11:09.000 --> 11:15.000
Simulating the Integrated Summertime CO2 Signature from Anthropogenic Emissions over Western Europe.

11:15.000 --> 11:19.000
That's what's known in my business as burying the lead.

11:19.000 --> 11:22.000
They'd shout it out loud in a paper titled

11:22.000 --> 11:29.000
Anthropogenic CO2 Comprises Only 3.75% of Atmospheric CO2 and Hope for a Nobel Prize.

11:29.000 --> 11:36.000
So that should have been your first clue that perhaps the paper doesn't say what you think it says.

11:36.000 --> 11:38.000
So where did Nelson go wrong?

11:38.000 --> 11:41.000
Well, it's not hard to figure out.

11:41.000 --> 11:46.000
The 15ppm figure he seized on wasn't referring to accumulated CO2 content.

11:46.000 --> 11:52.000
Once again, it was referring to carbon dioxide flux, which I explained earlier.

11:52.000 --> 11:58.000
This concept seems so hard for bloggers to grasp that I'll try to explain it with an analogy.

11:58.000 --> 12:04.000
Think of the carbon cycle as water circulating in an open tank with a plate across the middle.

12:04.000 --> 12:10.000
The tank holds 1000 litres, 500 in the top chamber and 500 in the bottom.

12:10.000 --> 12:14.000
And every day 100 litres of water is pumped into the upper chamber at one end,

12:14.000 --> 12:19.000
and at the same time 100 litres a day descends into the lower chamber through a valve.

12:19.000 --> 12:22.000
What happens to the level of water?

12:22.000 --> 12:25.000
Nothing. It stays pretty much the same.

12:25.000 --> 12:28.000
This is our carbon cycle.

12:28.000 --> 12:34.000
Now let's introduce some extra water into the upper chamber, which is our atmosphere, from a completely new source.

12:34.000 --> 12:41.000
Every day we'll add 2 litres of water, representing the 2% of anthropogenic carbon that isn't taken up by the carbon sink.

12:41.000 --> 12:43.000
And what happens?

12:43.000 --> 12:46.000
The level of the water goes up.

12:46.000 --> 12:48.000
The amount being added isn't much.

12:48.000 --> 12:51.000
It's only 2% of our total flux, after all.

12:51.000 --> 12:58.000
But it accumulates, and after 100 days there's an extra 200 litres in the tank.

12:58.000 --> 13:03.000
That represents two fifths of all the water in our upper tank, the atmosphere.

13:03.000 --> 13:07.000
So we now have two figures representing the water we've introduced.

13:07.000 --> 13:13.000
One figure is 2%, comparing our newly introduced water to the amount of water in circulation.

13:13.000 --> 13:21.000
The other is 40%, comparing the amount of this newly introduced water to the total amount of water in the upper tank.

13:21.000 --> 13:26.000
At the risk of labouring the point, our bloggers have confused these two figures.

13:26.000 --> 13:32.000
I hope the science is clear, but I'm sure a lot of people will still prefer to believe the hockey stick.

13:32.000 --> 13:34.000
So here's the twist.

13:34.000 --> 13:40.000
The authors of the ACP paper learned how their study was being misinterpreted around the internet,

13:40.000 --> 13:43.000
and they also traced the myth back to the hockey stick.

13:43.000 --> 13:47.000
They contacted Tom Nelson and told him he'd got it wrong.

13:47.000 --> 13:52.000
Researchers have occasionally done that in the past with little effect,

13:52.000 --> 13:57.000
but in this case, to his credit, Tom Nelson understood and issued a retraction.

13:58.000 --> 14:02.000
Unfortunately, the bloggers who copied from the hockey stick were less forthcoming.

14:02.000 --> 14:08.000
Jonathan Duhamel, who runs the Rye Heat blog, picked up on the hockey stick's retraction,

14:08.000 --> 14:13.000
but claimed Nelson had taken the site down because of pressure from the paper's authors.

14:13.000 --> 14:17.000
Even where he hints that this was in fact due to an error by Nelson,

14:17.000 --> 14:21.000
he blames the authors for not saying what they mean.

14:21.000 --> 14:26.000
And then Duhamel announces that Nelson didn't get it wrong after all.

14:26.000 --> 14:30.000
The contention made by hockey stick seems to be supported by old table

14:30.000 --> 14:34.000
from the Energy Information Administration, which shows the same thing.

14:34.000 --> 14:40.000
Only about 3% of atmospheric carbon dioxide is attributable to human sources.

14:40.000 --> 14:42.000
Look at the table and do the arithmetic.

14:42.000 --> 14:48.000
23,100 divided by 793,100 equals 0.029.

14:48.000 --> 14:55.000
Well, the math is right, but once again in the caption it explains that this is carbon dioxide flux.

14:55.000 --> 14:59.000
This is exactly the same mistake that Nelson made earlier in the hockey stick,

14:59.000 --> 15:05.000
and that Duhamel copied, mistaking CO2 flux for accumulated CO2.

15:05.000 --> 15:09.000
And blow-me-down, the lead author of the misquoted paper,

15:09.000 --> 15:14.000
Denika Boshinova, again had to intervene to explain the mistake.

15:14.000 --> 15:21.000
In reply, she was given a fact by Duhamel that only 3% of CO2 in the atmosphere is due to humans.

15:21.000 --> 15:24.000
This should be interesting.

15:24.000 --> 15:26.000
Boshinova tried to explain.

15:26.000 --> 15:29.000
Duhamel said, I don't understand your comment.

15:29.000 --> 15:32.000
What else but gross fluxes is worth looking at?

15:32.000 --> 15:39.000
There follows a long series of remedial lessons in basic climatology, which Duhamel finally begins to grasp.

15:39.000 --> 15:43.000
Then he suggests doing something he should have done on day one.

15:43.000 --> 15:47.000
I would be interested in reading the whole paper. No kidding.

15:47.000 --> 15:49.000
Then this.

15:49.000 --> 15:53.000
Many of us do not have access to the full paper, only the abstract.

15:53.000 --> 15:58.000
Studies funded by public money should be available to the interested public for free.

15:58.000 --> 16:05.000
Nice try, but in fact this paper is available for free. It's in an open access journal.

16:05.000 --> 16:12.000
Duhamel could have got his free copy as soon as he saw it being quoted by the hockey stick, just like I did.

16:12.000 --> 16:18.000
Then Duhamel complains that scientific papers are full of jargon that's hard to understand.

16:18.000 --> 16:25.000
Well John, then perhaps you shouldn't be running a blog telling people the science is wrong based on a paper you didn't read

16:25.000 --> 16:29.000
and which you thought is full of hard to understand jargon.

16:29.000 --> 16:34.000
Because the problem is, a lot of people assume that bloggers know what they're talking about

16:34.000 --> 16:38.000
and blindly copy and paste what you've written without bothering to check it.

16:38.000 --> 16:42.000
Case in point, what's up with that?

16:42.000 --> 16:46.000
And when it was all shown to be rubbish, Anthony Watts, who runs the blog,

16:46.000 --> 16:52.000
made the excuse that, since the original author had worked for the Tucson Citizen, that's Jonathan Duhamel,

16:52.000 --> 16:55.000
I made the mistake of assuming it was properly vetted.

16:55.000 --> 17:02.000
Well, of course, as we all know, bloggers who copy other bloggers are well known for having all their claims properly vetted.

17:02.000 --> 17:07.000
But let's face it, if the authors of the ACP paper hadn't contacted Tom Nelson,

17:07.000 --> 17:14.000
and if he hadn't issued a retraction, Watts would still be under the impression that the right-heat blog was properly vetted,

17:14.000 --> 17:17.000
and it would still be on the what's up with that blog.

17:17.000 --> 17:24.000
Actually, it is. The only clue that the whole thing is bunkum is a small note here saying it has an error.

17:24.000 --> 17:26.000
One error?

17:26.000 --> 17:31.000
And you have to scroll down to the update to find out that the error is the entire thing.

17:31.000 --> 17:33.000
Maybe, or maybe not.

17:33.000 --> 17:38.000
According to this letter from Duhamel, which is also printed in the update, it could be censorship,

17:38.000 --> 17:42.000
or duplicitous scientists going back on what they wrote in the paper.

17:42.000 --> 17:45.000
Says the man who couldn't understand the paper.

17:45.000 --> 17:52.000
Anthony, why not do what Tom Nelson did and cross out the bits of Duhamel's story that were wrong,

17:52.000 --> 17:57.000
so that people can still see what was originally written, but they'll understand it was all nonsense.

17:57.000 --> 18:06.000
They won't do what this guy did and copy your what's up with that page a year later without any indication that the whole thing is baloney.

18:06.000 --> 18:11.000
I've been warning about the danger of relying on these bloggers for years,

18:11.000 --> 18:16.000
but thanks to the recent presidential election, this warning has finally gone mainstream.

18:16.000 --> 18:24.000
We've seen fake news stories about the two candidates, and the phrase post-truth applied to the world of social media.

18:24.000 --> 18:30.000
But it's not just phony sites that are disseminating fake news, it's far more widespread than that.

18:30.000 --> 18:37.000
A blogger makes a mistake, whether intentionally or through sloppy research, or just plain ignorance,

18:37.000 --> 18:43.000
his blog is copied by another blogger and copied by another blogger until millions of people believe it.

18:43.000 --> 18:49.000
This is fake news being passed around by people who can't be bothered to check it.

18:49.000 --> 18:55.000
So you can't trust the people who generate this fake news to get it right or to correct it.

18:55.000 --> 19:02.000
It's up to us to do that, by checking where these stories come from when they land on Twitter or Facebook.

19:02.000 --> 19:05.000
And it's not always from Macedonia.

19:07.000 --> 19:11.000
