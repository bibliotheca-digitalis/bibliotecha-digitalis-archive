0	5000	How much CO2 is up there anyway?
5000	9000	Alright, so you know it's 0.03%
9000	13000	and of that, 4% of that is due to man.
13000	18000	Hang on, only 4% of the CO2 in the atmosphere is due to man?
18000	20000	Then what are we worrying about?
20000	23000	Even if we halve the amount of CO2 we produce,
23000	28000	it would barely make any difference if 96% is produced by nature.
28000	32000	Of course that depends on Piers Corbin being correct.
32000	34000	Do we have any confirmation of that?
34000	36000	Yes, sort of.
36000	43000	Human activity is maybe 3% contributing to the 3% of carbon dioxide
43000	45000	that's in Earth's atmosphere.
45000	51000	It's so negligible, it's a fraction of a fraction of a fraction of a percent.
51000	54000	OK, not 4% but 3% either way.
54000	57000	When I did my video on Steven Crowder last month,
57000	60000	this is the claim I actually wanted to take apart.
60000	62000	It's on his blog.
62000	66000	Most of the rise in CO2 is coming from natural sources.
66000	71000	But for some reason it didn't make it from Crowder's blog to his video.
71000	72000	What's his source?
72000	78000	It turns out there's only one and of course it's a blog by someone called Ed Carroll.
78000	82000	Before we try to verify what Carroll is claiming, here's some background.
82000	88000	Carbon dioxide concentration in the atmosphere has been pretty steady for over 2000 years.
88000	94000	And about the time the Industrial Revolution started, when we began burning coal, it started to rise.
94000	100000	And when we started burning oil, it rose more and more again as the whole world industrialised.
100000	107000	In fact, CO2 has been rising pretty consistently with our increased production of CO2.
107000	112000	Carroll argues that the extra carbon dioxide is not coming from burning coal and oil.
112000	115000	It's being degassed from the ocean.
115000	119000	Sea surface temperature seems to be driving atmospheric CO2 changes.
119000	124000	This makes sense because CO2's solubility in seawater is temperature dependent.
124000	130000	His argument is that the sun causes warming and this has caused the oceans to warm.
130000	135000	And as we know from basic physics, carbon dioxide is more soluble in colder water,
135000	139000	so as the oceans warm, they release carbon dioxide.
139000	146000	So he says this explains why the oceans are warming and it explains why there's been an increase in carbon dioxide.
146000	151000	Sounds convincing. So what is it Carroll is concealing?
151000	157000	Well, one thing is that solar output hasn't been increasing over the last 50 years.
157000	162000	It's been getting weaker. So something else must be causing the oceans to warm.
162000	168000	Secondly, the oceans haven't been degassing carbon dioxide. They've been absorbing it.
168000	174000	So the two pillars on which Carroll's model is based are simply wrong.
174000	178000	But this article by Ed Carroll isn't the source of all the claims on the internet
178000	184000	about anthropogenic sources being 3% or 4% of carbon dioxide in our atmosphere.
184000	191000	I did a Google search going back 10 years and the myth goes back much further than Carroll's article.
191000	199000	A lot of them trace back to this 2007 blog by Monty Heeb, which went viral in 2008.
199000	204000	The blogger is a former West Virginia office of miners safety engineer.
204000	209000	He wrote, human activities contribute slightly to greenhouse gas concentrations
209000	214000	but they're dwarfed in comparison to emissions from natural sources.
214000	220000	Heeb claims anthropogenic CO2 is just 3.225% of total CO2
220000	222000	and he worked this out from his own table.
222000	234000	The anthropogenic component, 11,880ppb, divided by the total CO2 concentration in the atmosphere, 368,400ppb.
234000	237000	But where do these figures come from?
237000	241000	First of all, Heeb's figure for natural additions is rather odd.
241000	249000	If nature is responsible for increasing CO2 concentration by 68,520ppb over the last 200 years,
249000	256000	after remaining in balance for over 2,000 years, then where did all this extra CO2 suddenly come from?
256000	264000	After all, that represents over half a billion tonnes of carbon dioxide suddenly erupting from the oceans and the biosphere,
264000	273000	equivalent to about 50,000 Mount St Helens-sized volcanoes, 25,000 of them popping off in the last 40 years.
273000	277000	And if most of the increase is due to some mysterious natural cause,
277000	282000	then where did all the CO2 from 200 years of fossil fuel burning go?
282000	289000	Did nature decide to hide all of our CO2 and substitute it with CO2 from some mysterious source?
289000	296000	But the clincher is isotopic evidence that the extra carbon has come from the burning of fossil fuels.
296000	301000	Very little of the carbon in coal and oil contains the isotope carbon-13,
301000	307000	whereas the carbon in volcanoes and oceans comprises about 1% carbon-13.
307000	314000	So if the extra CO2 is coming from the burning of fossil fuels, rather than volcanoes and ocean degasification,
314000	318000	then researchers ought to see the proportion of C-13 go down.
318000	320000	And they do.
320000	327000	So Heeb's claim is looking distinctly dodgy from the start, but let's check his sources to be sure.
327000	333000	He says the figure for natural additions comes from the Department of Energy, October 2000.
333000	339000	But I can't find any such estimate from the DOE for that year or any other year.
339000	344000	What the Department of Energy does say is exactly what other researchers say,
344000	348000	that there are no net natural additions to the atmosphere.
348000	353000	All the carbon that nature puts into the atmosphere gets absorbed back again.
353000	362000	As for the 11,880 parts per billion figure, Heeb says that comes from a 1997 blog by Tom Segelstad.
362000	370000	But I've checked, and the blog doesn't give any such figure, or an equivalent like 11.88 parts per million.
370000	377000	What I think Heeb's done is confuse accumulated carbon in the atmosphere with carbon flux,
377000	383000	because his figure of 3.22% for the anthropogenic component is very close to the 4%
383000	388000	that the DOE estimates is the anthropogenic component of carbon flux.
388000	396000	So bear with me while I explain this, because in a minute we'll see other bloggers make exactly the same mistake.
396000	401000	Every year around 220 billion tonnes of carbon is released into the atmosphere
401000	409000	from natural sources like ocean de-gasification, rotting vegetation, soil degradation, volcanic eruptions, and so on.
409000	416000	That's been going on for over 2000 years, and now humans are adding over 9 billion tonnes a year
416000	421000	by digging up and burning stuff that was underground, around 4% of the total.
421000	426000	By the way, I'm talking carbon here. The weight for carbon dioxide is obviously more.
426000	430000	So in a literal sense the bloggers would seem to have it right.
430000	433000	Anthropogenic sources hardly make any difference.
433000	436000	So what gives?
436000	439000	Well, once again the answer isn't rocket science.
439000	445000	While rotting vegetation releases carbon, living vegetation grows and takes it back.
445000	453000	While some CO2 is de-gassed from the oceans, even more CO2 is being dissolved in the oceans, as I explained earlier.
453000	459000	Although carbon is being released by soils, carbon is also being absorbed by soils.
459000	468000	And we're lucky enough that volcanic venting of CO2 is roughly balanced by CO2 taken out of the atmosphere through chemical weathering.
468000	471000	So it's a two-way street.
471000	477000	OK, it's not an exact equation, but it's been pretty much in balance for over 2000 years,
477000	481000	and that's what's kept CO2 levels in the atmosphere stable.
481000	487000	So when a whole load of extra CO2 is introduced into the mix, nature can't absorb it all
487000	490000	and the system is thrown out of balance.
490000	497000	Around half of the carbon we release is absorbed by the oceans in the biosphere, and half accumulates in the atmosphere.
497000	508000	So over the last 200 years, it's caused CO2 concentration to go from around 270 ppm to over 400 ppm.
508000	518000	As I say, I suspect this is what he's done, because his 3.22% is very close to the 4% of anthropogenic carbon added to the carbon flux.
518000	521000	And the difference could be that he's using older figures.
521000	529000	Whatever the case, his citation of Department of Energy data is wrong, because the Department of Energy gives completely different figures,
529000	532000	and his citing of another blog doesn't bear out.
532000	536000	So that's the end of that particular trail.
536000	545000	Then there was another flurry of activity six years later, when bloggers and posters claimed the anthropogenic component is 3.75%.
546000	551000	New paper finds only about 3.75% of atmospheric CO2 is man-made from burning of fossil fuels.
551000	554000	Only 3.75% of atmospheric CO2 comes from humans.
554000	558000	New paper finds only about 3.75% of atmospheric CO2 is man-made from burning of fossil fuels.
558000	561000	EPA document supports about 3% of atmospheric carbon dioxide.
561000	567000	New paper finds only about 3.75% of atmospheric carbon dioxide.
567000	572000	They claim their source is this paper, published in the Journal of Atmospheric Chemistry and Physics.
572000	576000	But as we'll see in a minute, the paper made no such conclusion.
576000	580000	So how did so many people make exactly the same mistake?
580000	584000	Was the paper ambiguous? Badly worded?
584000	587000	No, it turns out they didn't read the paper.
587000	595000	As so often happens, they read a blog that told them that the paper made this claim, and they didn't bother to verify it.
595000	599000	If you click on this link, for example, it doesn't take you to the paper being quoted.
599000	605000	It takes you to a blog called The Hockey Stik, run by someone called Tom Nelson.
605000	611000	And whatever route you take, direct or indirect, all the claims lead back to Nelson's blog.
611000	619000	He seems to be the only one to have read the paper, or at least a part of it, and he completely misunderstood what it was saying.
619000	627000	The authors examine how radiation from nuclear power plants in Europe can affect the ratio of carbon isotopes in the atmosphere.
627000	635000	Nelson read in the abstract that fossil fuel CO2 in the lower 1200m of the atmosphere are close to 15ppm.
635000	648000	And without bothering to read or understand the rest of the paper, he immediately worked out that 15ppm out of a total CO2 concentration of around 400ppm equals 3.75%.
648000	651000	So that became his headline.
651000	654000	Before I go on, here's a piece of advice Tom.
654000	660000	If nearly every scientific study concludes that about a third of CO2 in the atmosphere is anthropogenic,
660000	665000	and a group of researchers discovers that the actual figure is one-eighth of that,
665000	669000	they wouldn't mention it in passing in a paper titled
669000	675000	Simulating the Integrated Summertime CO2 Signature from Anthropogenic Emissions over Western Europe.
675000	679000	That's what's known in my business as burying the lead.
679000	682000	They'd shout it out loud in a paper titled
682000	689000	Anthropogenic CO2 Comprises Only 3.75% of Atmospheric CO2 and Hope for a Nobel Prize.
689000	696000	So that should have been your first clue that perhaps the paper doesn't say what you think it says.
696000	698000	So where did Nelson go wrong?
698000	701000	Well, it's not hard to figure out.
701000	706000	The 15ppm figure he seized on wasn't referring to accumulated CO2 content.
706000	712000	Once again, it was referring to carbon dioxide flux, which I explained earlier.
712000	718000	This concept seems so hard for bloggers to grasp that I'll try to explain it with an analogy.
718000	724000	Think of the carbon cycle as water circulating in an open tank with a plate across the middle.
724000	730000	The tank holds 1000 litres, 500 in the top chamber and 500 in the bottom.
730000	734000	And every day 100 litres of water is pumped into the upper chamber at one end,
734000	739000	and at the same time 100 litres a day descends into the lower chamber through a valve.
739000	742000	What happens to the level of water?
742000	745000	Nothing. It stays pretty much the same.
745000	748000	This is our carbon cycle.
748000	754000	Now let's introduce some extra water into the upper chamber, which is our atmosphere, from a completely new source.
754000	761000	Every day we'll add 2 litres of water, representing the 2% of anthropogenic carbon that isn't taken up by the carbon sink.
761000	763000	And what happens?
763000	766000	The level of the water goes up.
766000	768000	The amount being added isn't much.
768000	771000	It's only 2% of our total flux, after all.
771000	778000	But it accumulates, and after 100 days there's an extra 200 litres in the tank.
778000	783000	That represents two fifths of all the water in our upper tank, the atmosphere.
783000	787000	So we now have two figures representing the water we've introduced.
787000	793000	One figure is 2%, comparing our newly introduced water to the amount of water in circulation.
793000	801000	The other is 40%, comparing the amount of this newly introduced water to the total amount of water in the upper tank.
801000	806000	At the risk of labouring the point, our bloggers have confused these two figures.
806000	812000	I hope the science is clear, but I'm sure a lot of people will still prefer to believe the hockey stick.
812000	814000	So here's the twist.
814000	820000	The authors of the ACP paper learned how their study was being misinterpreted around the internet,
820000	823000	and they also traced the myth back to the hockey stick.
823000	827000	They contacted Tom Nelson and told him he'd got it wrong.
827000	832000	Researchers have occasionally done that in the past with little effect,
832000	837000	but in this case, to his credit, Tom Nelson understood and issued a retraction.
838000	842000	Unfortunately, the bloggers who copied from the hockey stick were less forthcoming.
842000	848000	Jonathan Duhamel, who runs the Rye Heat blog, picked up on the hockey stick's retraction,
848000	853000	but claimed Nelson had taken the site down because of pressure from the paper's authors.
853000	857000	Even where he hints that this was in fact due to an error by Nelson,
857000	861000	he blames the authors for not saying what they mean.
861000	866000	And then Duhamel announces that Nelson didn't get it wrong after all.
866000	870000	The contention made by hockey stick seems to be supported by old table
870000	874000	from the Energy Information Administration, which shows the same thing.
874000	880000	Only about 3% of atmospheric carbon dioxide is attributable to human sources.
880000	882000	Look at the table and do the arithmetic.
882000	888000	23,100 divided by 793,100 equals 0.029.
888000	895000	Well, the math is right, but once again in the caption it explains that this is carbon dioxide flux.
895000	899000	This is exactly the same mistake that Nelson made earlier in the hockey stick,
899000	905000	and that Duhamel copied, mistaking CO2 flux for accumulated CO2.
905000	909000	And blow-me-down, the lead author of the misquoted paper,
909000	914000	Denika Boshinova, again had to intervene to explain the mistake.
914000	921000	In reply, she was given a fact by Duhamel that only 3% of CO2 in the atmosphere is due to humans.
921000	924000	This should be interesting.
924000	926000	Boshinova tried to explain.
926000	929000	Duhamel said, I don't understand your comment.
929000	932000	What else but gross fluxes is worth looking at?
932000	939000	There follows a long series of remedial lessons in basic climatology, which Duhamel finally begins to grasp.
939000	943000	Then he suggests doing something he should have done on day one.
943000	947000	I would be interested in reading the whole paper. No kidding.
947000	949000	Then this.
949000	953000	Many of us do not have access to the full paper, only the abstract.
953000	958000	Studies funded by public money should be available to the interested public for free.
958000	965000	Nice try, but in fact this paper is available for free. It's in an open access journal.
965000	972000	Duhamel could have got his free copy as soon as he saw it being quoted by the hockey stick, just like I did.
972000	978000	Then Duhamel complains that scientific papers are full of jargon that's hard to understand.
978000	985000	Well John, then perhaps you shouldn't be running a blog telling people the science is wrong based on a paper you didn't read
985000	989000	and which you thought is full of hard to understand jargon.
989000	994000	Because the problem is, a lot of people assume that bloggers know what they're talking about
994000	998000	and blindly copy and paste what you've written without bothering to check it.
998000	1002000	Case in point, what's up with that?
1002000	1006000	And when it was all shown to be rubbish, Anthony Watts, who runs the blog,
1006000	1012000	made the excuse that, since the original author had worked for the Tucson Citizen, that's Jonathan Duhamel,
1012000	1015000	I made the mistake of assuming it was properly vetted.
1015000	1022000	Well, of course, as we all know, bloggers who copy other bloggers are well known for having all their claims properly vetted.
1022000	1027000	But let's face it, if the authors of the ACP paper hadn't contacted Tom Nelson,
1027000	1034000	and if he hadn't issued a retraction, Watts would still be under the impression that the right-heat blog was properly vetted,
1034000	1037000	and it would still be on the what's up with that blog.
1037000	1044000	Actually, it is. The only clue that the whole thing is bunkum is a small note here saying it has an error.
1044000	1046000	One error?
1046000	1051000	And you have to scroll down to the update to find out that the error is the entire thing.
1051000	1053000	Maybe, or maybe not.
1053000	1058000	According to this letter from Duhamel, which is also printed in the update, it could be censorship,
1058000	1062000	or duplicitous scientists going back on what they wrote in the paper.
1062000	1065000	Says the man who couldn't understand the paper.
1065000	1072000	Anthony, why not do what Tom Nelson did and cross out the bits of Duhamel's story that were wrong,
1072000	1077000	so that people can still see what was originally written, but they'll understand it was all nonsense.
1077000	1086000	They won't do what this guy did and copy your what's up with that page a year later without any indication that the whole thing is baloney.
1086000	1091000	I've been warning about the danger of relying on these bloggers for years,
1091000	1096000	but thanks to the recent presidential election, this warning has finally gone mainstream.
1096000	1104000	We've seen fake news stories about the two candidates, and the phrase post-truth applied to the world of social media.
1104000	1110000	But it's not just phony sites that are disseminating fake news, it's far more widespread than that.
1110000	1117000	A blogger makes a mistake, whether intentionally or through sloppy research, or just plain ignorance,
1117000	1123000	his blog is copied by another blogger and copied by another blogger until millions of people believe it.
1123000	1129000	This is fake news being passed around by people who can't be bothered to check it.
1129000	1135000	So you can't trust the people who generate this fake news to get it right or to correct it.
1135000	1142000	It's up to us to do that, by checking where these stories come from when they land on Twitter or Facebook.
1142000	1145000	And it's not always from Macedonia.
