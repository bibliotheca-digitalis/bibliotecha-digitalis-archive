00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
In the first video of this series I looked at the science behind anthropogenic climate change,

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:09,000
the idea that man-made carbon gases are responsible for global warming.

3
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:14,000
70 years ago the view that carbon dioxide could affect the global climate

4
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:17,000
was held by only a tiny minority of climate scientists.

5
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:21,000
Many assumed that there would be some sort of self-regulating mechanism

6
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:23,000
that would put things back into balance.

7
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:28,000
Then there was the scientifically valid view that water vapour also traps radiation

8
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:33,000
and warms up the earth, and it's far more abundant in the atmosphere than carbon dioxide.

9
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:36,000
But research in the 1940s changed all that.

10
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:42,000
Guy Stewart Callender, a British engineer, showed that radiation absorption is not even.

11
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:47,000
Water vapour absorbs radiation mainly in the 18 to 30 micrometre band

12
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:50,000
and allows most of the rest to escape into space.

13
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:53,000
In effect, these absorption gaps act like cooling vents.

14
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:59,000
But carbon dioxide absorbs radiation in a different range, 8 to 18 micrometres.

15
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:04,000
So Callender concluded that carbon dioxide mops up this escaping radiation,

16
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:07,000
effectively acting as a plug to these cooling vents.

17
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:11,000
Over the next few decades, objections to the idea of anthropogenic climate change

18
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:16,000
were gradually eroded as more and more evidence emerged in support of it.

19
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:20,000
Today, by almost any measure, the overwhelming majority of climate scientists

20
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:26,000
accept not only that the earth is warming, but that man-made carbon gases are responsible.

21
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:31,000
In 2004, the magazine Science published a study by Naomi Oreskes

22
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:33,000
looking at the degree of consensus.

23
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:36,000
A search of scientific papers over the previous ten years

24
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:40,000
showed that all of those commenting or dealing with recent global warming,

25
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:46,000
nearly 700 papers, explicitly endorsed the view that man-made gases are responsible.

26
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:50,000
This survey is sometimes used to suggest that there are no papers

27
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:54,000
disputing anthropogenic climate change and no alternative hypotheses.

28
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:57,000
As we'll see, that's simply not the case.

29
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:00,000
The survey results were obtained by doing a search for the words

30
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:03,000
global climate change in scientific abstracts,

31
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:07,000
so the results can't be regarded as 100% accurate.

32
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:10,000
But they do give an indication of the overwhelming consensus

33
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:13,000
supporting anthropogenic climate change.

34
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:17,000
Oreskes also found that all major scientific bodies in the United States

35
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:22,000
agreed that man-made gases are responsible for recent climate change.

36
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,000
But although they're few in number,

37
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:27,000
there are scientific papers supporting alternative hypotheses.

38
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:31,000
Far from ignoring them, climate scientists are very familiar with them.

39
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:34,000
The alternatives can be broken down into two basic ideas.

40
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:38,000
Firstly, the proposal that increased output from the sun is driving climate change,

41
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:41,000
a phenomenon known as solar forcing.

42
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:45,000
Secondly, the proposal that cloud cover is affecting global temperatures.

43
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:48,000
But first things first, nearly all climate scientists agree

44
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:53,000
that the Earth's climate warms and cools in concert with the varying energy output from the sun.

45
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:58,000
But the crucial question is whether that's the cause of the recent rise in global temperatures,

46
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:01,000
basically over the last 40 or 50 years.

47
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:06,000
27 years ago, a paper was published with very strong evidence for exactly that.

48
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:10,000
Egel Fries Kristensen and Knud Lassen of the Danish Meteorological Institute

49
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:14,000
looked at the pattern of solar activity over the last 250 years

50
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:18,000
and it matched almost perfectly with global temperature changes.

51
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:21,000
But closer examination of the data revealed a flaw.

52
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:25,000
To get their graph, Fries Kristensen and Lassen had to filter the data.

53
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:30,000
That basically means smoothing it out to account for background variation and local anomalies.

54
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:34,000
This is standard practice and they did that for most of the graph.

55
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:37,000
But they didn't do it for the most recent part of the graph

56
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:41,000
because the data needed to do it wasn't available at the time of publication.

57
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:45,000
When it did become available, the graph showed a very different story.

58
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:49,000
A very good correlation between global temperatures and solar output

59
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:51,000
over most of the last 250 years,

60
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:56,000
but not the very period that covers a dramatic rise in global temperatures.

61
00:03:56,000 --> 00:04:01,000
While global temperatures have been rising, solar activity has remained more or less static.

62
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:06,000
Since the 1991 paper, a number of other research papers have been written

63
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:10,000
and nearly all confirmed what the revised Fries Kristensen-Lassen graph showed.

64
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:15,000
Solar activity explains most of the temperature changes over the last few hundred years,

65
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:18,000
but not the recent period of rising global temperatures.

66
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:22,000
But there's one more thing to check before discounting solar forcing as an option.

67
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:26,000
All the historical data measuring the amount of solar energy falling on the Earth

68
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,000
are derived by secondary methods.

69
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:33,000
Sunspot counts, levels of carbon-14 and beryllium-10, for example.

70
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:37,000
To get a measure of the Sun's exact output, you have to go into space,

71
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:40,000
away from all the meteorological clutter on Earth.

72
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:44,000
So in the early 2000s, several researchers looked at the satellite data,

73
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:48,000
which measures something called the TSI, total solar irradiance.

74
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,000
But there's a problem.

75
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:54,000
The main satellite series they depend on for their data is called ACRIM.

76
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:59,000
The first ACRIM satellite, ACRIM-1, was in orbit from 1980 to 1989,

77
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:02,000
when it was due to be replaced by ACRIM-2.

78
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:05,000
But then the Challenger disaster happened,

79
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:08,000
and ACRIM-2 didn't get launched for another two years.

80
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,000
So there's a gap in the data.

81
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:14,000
And exactly where the gap occurs, there's an apparent jump in the TSI.

82
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:19,000
Richard Wilson of Columbia University, who helped devise the ACRIM equipment,

83
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:22,000
made up for the gap by looking at data from another satellite,

84
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,000
which confirmed the increase.

85
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:31,000
Wilson derived a small increase of total solar irradiance of 0.05% per decade.

86
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:34,000
But Judith Lean of the Naval Research Laboratory in Washington,

87
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:39,000
using data from another satellite, found no increase in solar output,

88
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:45,000
and other researchers confirmed that with measurements of ultraviolet radiation and sunspot counts.

89
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:51,000
A third satellite even showed a decrease in TSI during what's become known as the ACRIM gap.

90
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:57,000
But most climatologists say even if the ACRIM increase is real, it's too small to be significant,

91
00:05:57,000 --> 00:06:02,000
about the same order of variation we get in a typical 11-year solar cycle.

92
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:08,000
This was also the conclusion of a review in the magazine Nature, which looked at all the varying data.

93
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:12,000
The bottom line on solar forcing is that a lot of studies have been done,

94
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:15,000
and this is far from an issue that's being ignored.

95
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:19,000
Output from the sun is an important factor driving the Earth's climate.

96
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:23,000
But climate scientists say that although there have been fluctuations,

97
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:28,000
there's been no significant increase in solar output over the last 40 years.

98
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:33,000
Solar forcing simply doesn't explain the recent dramatic rise in global temperatures.

99
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:39,000
So what about the other objection to anthropogenic climate change focusing on cloud formation?

100
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:42,000
This can be divided into two basic hypotheses.

101
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:45,000
The first suggests that cosmic rays seed clouds.

102
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:51,000
When solar activity increases, particles from the sun keep these cosmic rays away from the Earth,

103
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:53,000
and that reduces cloud cover.

104
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:57,000
With less cloud to reflect sunlight, the Earth warms up.

105
00:06:57,000 --> 00:07:02,000
The idea was proposed in 1997 by Fris Christiansen and Henrik Svensmark.

106
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:05,000
They backed up their hypothesis with satellite data,

107
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:08,000
showing a correlation between low-atmosphere cloud cover

108
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:14,000
and the intensity of cosmic rays arriving at the Earth between 1980 and 1995.

109
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:20,000
It's an interesting idea, and one that's been seriously looked at by a number of climate scientists,

110
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:22,000
but only a few supported.

111
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:25,000
The most obvious problem is that the hypothesis once again

112
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:29,000
hinges on increased solar output over the last 40 years,

113
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:32,000
and climate scientists say that hasn't been happening.

114
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:35,000
If that's the case, why the apparent correlation?

115
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:39,000
Two researchers writing in the journal Astronomy and Geophysics

116
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:45,000
studied this further and discovered that the correlation in fact breaks down after 1991.

117
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:49,000
And any correlation that does exist may be difficult to pin down

118
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:52,000
because of the age-old problem of cause and effect.

119
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:55,000
The second idea on cloud cover comes from Richard Linson

120
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:58,000
of the Department of Meteorology at MIT.

121
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:03,000
He postulates that warmer tropical oceans result in fewer high-altitude cirrus clouds.

122
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:09,000
Fewer clouds mean more infrared radiation can escape into space, cooling the Earth down.

123
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:12,000
In other words, the Earth has a self-regulating mechanism.

124
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:16,000
Linson calls this the Infrared Iris Hypothesis.

125
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:19,000
Before I look at this, let me clear something up.

126
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:24,000
Linson says fewer clouds cool the Earth down because clouds trap heat.

127
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:28,000
Fritz Christensen and Svensmarck argue that fewer clouds warm the Earth up

128
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:30,000
because clouds reflect sunlight.

129
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:33,000
Well, this whole area is a bit tricky. Clouds do both.

130
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:39,000
When planes were grounded across the United States following the 9-11 attacks in 2001,

131
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:43,000
American skies were suddenly clear of contrails for three days.

132
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:49,000
Contrails form high-altitude clouds, so this was a unique opportunity to study their effect.

133
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:52,000
Scientists from the University of Wisconsin and Penn State

134
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:56,000
analyzed temperatures for the three days before and after 9-11.

135
00:08:56,000 --> 00:09:00,000
They found that daytime temperatures rose by a little less than one degree

136
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:04,000
thanks to the disappearance of the contrails that no longer block the sun.

137
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:07,000
But nighttime temperatures fell by an equal amount

138
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:11,000
because the contrail cloud cover was no longer there to act as a blanket,

139
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:14,000
preventing the escape of infrared radiation into space.

140
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:18,000
Bing Lin, an atmospheric research scientist at NASA,

141
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:21,000
found that instead of cooling the Earth, as Linson had predicted,

142
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:26,000
the effect of fewer cirrus clouds in the tropics is to very slightly warm it.

143
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:30,000
Lin also couldn't replicate Linson's results on increased cirrus cloud formation

144
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:32,000
and he soon found out why.

145
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:35,000
Linson had chosen to base his model around Indonesia,

146
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:38,000
which has the warmest pool of water on the planet,

147
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:41,000
so it's not typical of the tropics.

148
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:43,000
Lin found that over the tropics as a whole,

149
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:46,000
the increase in cirrus cloud cover from warmer temperatures

150
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:49,000
is much less than Linson had predicted.

151
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:52,000
There are other factors affecting the Earth's climate,

152
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:54,000
most notably volcanic eruptions,

153
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:57,000
but climate scientists agree that this isn't a significant factor

154
00:09:57,000 --> 00:10:00,000
in the current period of global warming.

155
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:03,000
This and the previous video covered the science of global warming

156
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:06,000
and the scientific debate among experts.

157
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:10,000
In the next video we'll descend into something far easier to unravel,

158
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:14,000
the urban myth swamp, as we try to sort out fact from fiction

159
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:17,000
and track misinformation back to its source.
