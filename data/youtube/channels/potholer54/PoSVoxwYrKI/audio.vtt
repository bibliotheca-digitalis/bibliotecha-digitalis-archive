00:00.000 --> 00:05.000
In the first video of this series I looked at the science behind anthropogenic climate change,

00:05.000 --> 00:09.000
the idea that man-made carbon gases are responsible for global warming.

00:09.000 --> 00:14.000
70 years ago the view that carbon dioxide could affect the global climate

00:14.000 --> 00:17.000
was held by only a tiny minority of climate scientists.

00:17.000 --> 00:21.000
Many assumed that there would be some sort of self-regulating mechanism

00:21.000 --> 00:23.000
that would put things back into balance.

00:23.000 --> 00:28.000
Then there was the scientifically valid view that water vapour also traps radiation

00:28.000 --> 00:33.000
and warms up the earth, and it's far more abundant in the atmosphere than carbon dioxide.

00:33.000 --> 00:36.000
But research in the 1940s changed all that.

00:36.000 --> 00:42.000
Guy Stewart Callender, a British engineer, showed that radiation absorption is not even.

00:42.000 --> 00:47.000
Water vapour absorbs radiation mainly in the 18 to 30 micrometre band

00:47.000 --> 00:50.000
and allows most of the rest to escape into space.

00:50.000 --> 00:53.000
In effect, these absorption gaps act like cooling vents.

00:54.000 --> 00:59.000
But carbon dioxide absorbs radiation in a different range, 8 to 18 micrometres.

00:59.000 --> 01:04.000
So Callender concluded that carbon dioxide mops up this escaping radiation,

01:04.000 --> 01:07.000
effectively acting as a plug to these cooling vents.

01:07.000 --> 01:11.000
Over the next few decades, objections to the idea of anthropogenic climate change

01:11.000 --> 01:16.000
were gradually eroded as more and more evidence emerged in support of it.

01:16.000 --> 01:20.000
Today, by almost any measure, the overwhelming majority of climate scientists

01:20.000 --> 01:26.000
accept not only that the earth is warming, but that man-made carbon gases are responsible.

01:26.000 --> 01:31.000
In 2004, the magazine Science published a study by Naomi Oreskes

01:31.000 --> 01:33.000
looking at the degree of consensus.

01:33.000 --> 01:36.000
A search of scientific papers over the previous ten years

01:36.000 --> 01:40.000
showed that all of those commenting or dealing with recent global warming,

01:40.000 --> 01:46.000
nearly 700 papers, explicitly endorsed the view that man-made gases are responsible.

01:46.000 --> 01:50.000
This survey is sometimes used to suggest that there are no papers

01:50.000 --> 01:54.000
disputing anthropogenic climate change and no alternative hypotheses.

01:54.000 --> 01:57.000
As we'll see, that's simply not the case.

01:57.000 --> 02:00.000
The survey results were obtained by doing a search for the words

02:00.000 --> 02:03.000
global climate change in scientific abstracts,

02:03.000 --> 02:07.000
so the results can't be regarded as 100% accurate.

02:07.000 --> 02:10.000
But they do give an indication of the overwhelming consensus

02:10.000 --> 02:13.000
supporting anthropogenic climate change.

02:13.000 --> 02:17.000
Oreskes also found that all major scientific bodies in the United States

02:17.000 --> 02:22.000
agreed that man-made gases are responsible for recent climate change.

02:22.000 --> 02:24.000
But although they're few in number,

02:24.000 --> 02:27.000
there are scientific papers supporting alternative hypotheses.

02:27.000 --> 02:31.000
Far from ignoring them, climate scientists are very familiar with them.

02:31.000 --> 02:34.000
The alternatives can be broken down into two basic ideas.

02:34.000 --> 02:38.000
Firstly, the proposal that increased output from the sun is driving climate change,

02:38.000 --> 02:41.000
a phenomenon known as solar forcing.

02:41.000 --> 02:45.000
Secondly, the proposal that cloud cover is affecting global temperatures.

02:45.000 --> 02:48.000
But first things first, nearly all climate scientists agree

02:48.000 --> 02:53.000
that the Earth's climate warms and cools in concert with the varying energy output from the sun.

02:53.000 --> 02:58.000
But the crucial question is whether that's the cause of the recent rise in global temperatures,

02:58.000 --> 03:01.000
basically over the last 40 or 50 years.

03:01.000 --> 03:06.000
27 years ago, a paper was published with very strong evidence for exactly that.

03:06.000 --> 03:10.000
Egel Fries Kristensen and Knud Lassen of the Danish Meteorological Institute

03:10.000 --> 03:14.000
looked at the pattern of solar activity over the last 250 years

03:14.000 --> 03:18.000
and it matched almost perfectly with global temperature changes.

03:18.000 --> 03:21.000
But closer examination of the data revealed a flaw.

03:21.000 --> 03:25.000
To get their graph, Fries Kristensen and Lassen had to filter the data.

03:25.000 --> 03:30.000
That basically means smoothing it out to account for background variation and local anomalies.

03:30.000 --> 03:34.000
This is standard practice and they did that for most of the graph.

03:34.000 --> 03:37.000
But they didn't do it for the most recent part of the graph

03:37.000 --> 03:41.000
because the data needed to do it wasn't available at the time of publication.

03:41.000 --> 03:45.000
When it did become available, the graph showed a very different story.

03:45.000 --> 03:49.000
A very good correlation between global temperatures and solar output

03:49.000 --> 03:51.000
over most of the last 250 years,

03:51.000 --> 03:56.000
but not the very period that covers a dramatic rise in global temperatures.

03:56.000 --> 04:01.000
While global temperatures have been rising, solar activity has remained more or less static.

04:02.000 --> 04:06.000
Since the 1991 paper, a number of other research papers have been written

04:06.000 --> 04:10.000
and nearly all confirmed what the revised Fries Kristensen-Lassen graph showed.

04:10.000 --> 04:15.000
Solar activity explains most of the temperature changes over the last few hundred years,

04:15.000 --> 04:18.000
but not the recent period of rising global temperatures.

04:18.000 --> 04:22.000
But there's one more thing to check before discounting solar forcing as an option.

04:22.000 --> 04:26.000
All the historical data measuring the amount of solar energy falling on the Earth

04:26.000 --> 04:28.000
are derived by secondary methods.

04:28.000 --> 04:33.000
Sunspot counts, levels of carbon-14 and beryllium-10, for example.

04:33.000 --> 04:37.000
To get a measure of the Sun's exact output, you have to go into space,

04:37.000 --> 04:40.000
away from all the meteorological clutter on Earth.

04:40.000 --> 04:44.000
So in the early 2000s, several researchers looked at the satellite data,

04:44.000 --> 04:48.000
which measures something called the TSI, total solar irradiance.

04:48.000 --> 04:50.000
But there's a problem.

04:50.000 --> 04:54.000
The main satellite series they depend on for their data is called ACRIM.

04:54.000 --> 04:59.000
The first ACRIM satellite, ACRIM-1, was in orbit from 1980 to 1989,

04:59.000 --> 05:02.000
when it was due to be replaced by ACRIM-2.

05:02.000 --> 05:05.000
But then the Challenger disaster happened,

05:05.000 --> 05:08.000
and ACRIM-2 didn't get launched for another two years.

05:08.000 --> 05:10.000
So there's a gap in the data.

05:10.000 --> 05:14.000
And exactly where the gap occurs, there's an apparent jump in the TSI.

05:14.000 --> 05:19.000
Richard Wilson of Columbia University, who helped devise the ACRIM equipment,

05:19.000 --> 05:22.000
made up for the gap by looking at data from another satellite,

05:22.000 --> 05:24.000
which confirmed the increase.

05:24.000 --> 05:31.000
Wilson derived a small increase of total solar irradiance of 0.05% per decade.

05:31.000 --> 05:34.000
But Judith Lean of the Naval Research Laboratory in Washington,

05:34.000 --> 05:39.000
using data from another satellite, found no increase in solar output,

05:39.000 --> 05:45.000
and other researchers confirmed that with measurements of ultraviolet radiation and sunspot counts.

05:45.000 --> 05:51.000
A third satellite even showed a decrease in TSI during what's become known as the ACRIM gap.

05:51.000 --> 05:57.000
But most climatologists say even if the ACRIM increase is real, it's too small to be significant,

05:57.000 --> 06:02.000
about the same order of variation we get in a typical 11-year solar cycle.

06:02.000 --> 06:08.000
This was also the conclusion of a review in the magazine Nature, which looked at all the varying data.

06:08.000 --> 06:12.000
The bottom line on solar forcing is that a lot of studies have been done,

06:12.000 --> 06:15.000
and this is far from an issue that's being ignored.

06:15.000 --> 06:19.000
Output from the sun is an important factor driving the Earth's climate.

06:19.000 --> 06:23.000
But climate scientists say that although there have been fluctuations,

06:23.000 --> 06:28.000
there's been no significant increase in solar output over the last 40 years.

06:28.000 --> 06:33.000
Solar forcing simply doesn't explain the recent dramatic rise in global temperatures.

06:33.000 --> 06:39.000
So what about the other objection to anthropogenic climate change focusing on cloud formation?

06:39.000 --> 06:42.000
This can be divided into two basic hypotheses.

06:42.000 --> 06:45.000
The first suggests that cosmic rays seed clouds.

06:46.000 --> 06:51.000
When solar activity increases, particles from the sun keep these cosmic rays away from the Earth,

06:51.000 --> 06:53.000
and that reduces cloud cover.

06:53.000 --> 06:57.000
With less cloud to reflect sunlight, the Earth warms up.

06:57.000 --> 07:02.000
The idea was proposed in 1997 by Fris Christiansen and Henrik Svensmark.

07:02.000 --> 07:05.000
They backed up their hypothesis with satellite data,

07:05.000 --> 07:08.000
showing a correlation between low-atmosphere cloud cover

07:08.000 --> 07:14.000
and the intensity of cosmic rays arriving at the Earth between 1980 and 1995.

07:15.000 --> 07:20.000
It's an interesting idea, and one that's been seriously looked at by a number of climate scientists,

07:20.000 --> 07:22.000
but only a few supported.

07:22.000 --> 07:25.000
The most obvious problem is that the hypothesis once again

07:25.000 --> 07:29.000
hinges on increased solar output over the last 40 years,

07:29.000 --> 07:32.000
and climate scientists say that hasn't been happening.

07:32.000 --> 07:35.000
If that's the case, why the apparent correlation?

07:35.000 --> 07:39.000
Two researchers writing in the journal Astronomy and Geophysics

07:39.000 --> 07:45.000
studied this further and discovered that the correlation in fact breaks down after 1991.

07:45.000 --> 07:49.000
And any correlation that does exist may be difficult to pin down

07:49.000 --> 07:52.000
because of the age-old problem of cause and effect.

07:52.000 --> 07:55.000
The second idea on cloud cover comes from Richard Linson

07:55.000 --> 07:58.000
of the Department of Meteorology at MIT.

07:58.000 --> 08:03.000
He postulates that warmer tropical oceans result in fewer high-altitude cirrus clouds.

08:03.000 --> 08:09.000
Fewer clouds mean more infrared radiation can escape into space, cooling the Earth down.

08:09.000 --> 08:12.000
In other words, the Earth has a self-regulating mechanism.

08:12.000 --> 08:16.000
Linson calls this the Infrared Iris Hypothesis.

08:16.000 --> 08:19.000
Before I look at this, let me clear something up.

08:19.000 --> 08:24.000
Linson says fewer clouds cool the Earth down because clouds trap heat.

08:24.000 --> 08:28.000
Fritz Christensen and Svensmarck argue that fewer clouds warm the Earth up

08:28.000 --> 08:30.000
because clouds reflect sunlight.

08:30.000 --> 08:33.000
Well, this whole area is a bit tricky. Clouds do both.

08:33.000 --> 08:39.000
When planes were grounded across the United States following the 9-11 attacks in 2001,

08:39.000 --> 08:43.000
American skies were suddenly clear of contrails for three days.

08:43.000 --> 08:49.000
Contrails form high-altitude clouds, so this was a unique opportunity to study their effect.

08:49.000 --> 08:52.000
Scientists from the University of Wisconsin and Penn State

08:52.000 --> 08:56.000
analyzed temperatures for the three days before and after 9-11.

08:56.000 --> 09:00.000
They found that daytime temperatures rose by a little less than one degree

09:00.000 --> 09:04.000
thanks to the disappearance of the contrails that no longer block the sun.

09:04.000 --> 09:07.000
But nighttime temperatures fell by an equal amount

09:07.000 --> 09:11.000
because the contrail cloud cover was no longer there to act as a blanket,

09:11.000 --> 09:14.000
preventing the escape of infrared radiation into space.

09:14.000 --> 09:18.000
Bing Lin, an atmospheric research scientist at NASA,

09:18.000 --> 09:21.000
found that instead of cooling the Earth, as Linson had predicted,

09:22.000 --> 09:26.000
the effect of fewer cirrus clouds in the tropics is to very slightly warm it.

09:26.000 --> 09:30.000
Lin also couldn't replicate Linson's results on increased cirrus cloud formation

09:30.000 --> 09:32.000
and he soon found out why.

09:32.000 --> 09:35.000
Linson had chosen to base his model around Indonesia,

09:35.000 --> 09:38.000
which has the warmest pool of water on the planet,

09:38.000 --> 09:41.000
so it's not typical of the tropics.

09:41.000 --> 09:43.000
Lin found that over the tropics as a whole,

09:43.000 --> 09:46.000
the increase in cirrus cloud cover from warmer temperatures

09:46.000 --> 09:49.000
is much less than Linson had predicted.

09:49.000 --> 09:52.000
There are other factors affecting the Earth's climate,

09:52.000 --> 09:54.000
most notably volcanic eruptions,

09:54.000 --> 09:57.000
but climate scientists agree that this isn't a significant factor

09:57.000 --> 10:00.000
in the current period of global warming.

10:00.000 --> 10:03.000
This and the previous video covered the science of global warming

10:03.000 --> 10:06.000
and the scientific debate among experts.

10:06.000 --> 10:10.000
In the next video we'll descend into something far easier to unravel,

10:10.000 --> 10:14.000
the urban myth swamp, as we try to sort out fact from fiction

10:14.000 --> 10:17.000
and track misinformation back to its source.
