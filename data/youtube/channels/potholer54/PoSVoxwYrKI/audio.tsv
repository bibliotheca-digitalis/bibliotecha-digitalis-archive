0	5000	In the first video of this series I looked at the science behind anthropogenic climate change,
5000	9000	the idea that man-made carbon gases are responsible for global warming.
9000	14000	70 years ago the view that carbon dioxide could affect the global climate
14000	17000	was held by only a tiny minority of climate scientists.
17000	21000	Many assumed that there would be some sort of self-regulating mechanism
21000	23000	that would put things back into balance.
23000	28000	Then there was the scientifically valid view that water vapour also traps radiation
28000	33000	and warms up the earth, and it's far more abundant in the atmosphere than carbon dioxide.
33000	36000	But research in the 1940s changed all that.
36000	42000	Guy Stewart Callender, a British engineer, showed that radiation absorption is not even.
42000	47000	Water vapour absorbs radiation mainly in the 18 to 30 micrometre band
47000	50000	and allows most of the rest to escape into space.
50000	53000	In effect, these absorption gaps act like cooling vents.
54000	59000	But carbon dioxide absorbs radiation in a different range, 8 to 18 micrometres.
59000	64000	So Callender concluded that carbon dioxide mops up this escaping radiation,
64000	67000	effectively acting as a plug to these cooling vents.
67000	71000	Over the next few decades, objections to the idea of anthropogenic climate change
71000	76000	were gradually eroded as more and more evidence emerged in support of it.
76000	80000	Today, by almost any measure, the overwhelming majority of climate scientists
80000	86000	accept not only that the earth is warming, but that man-made carbon gases are responsible.
86000	91000	In 2004, the magazine Science published a study by Naomi Oreskes
91000	93000	looking at the degree of consensus.
93000	96000	A search of scientific papers over the previous ten years
96000	100000	showed that all of those commenting or dealing with recent global warming,
100000	106000	nearly 700 papers, explicitly endorsed the view that man-made gases are responsible.
106000	110000	This survey is sometimes used to suggest that there are no papers
110000	114000	disputing anthropogenic climate change and no alternative hypotheses.
114000	117000	As we'll see, that's simply not the case.
117000	120000	The survey results were obtained by doing a search for the words
120000	123000	global climate change in scientific abstracts,
123000	127000	so the results can't be regarded as 100% accurate.
127000	130000	But they do give an indication of the overwhelming consensus
130000	133000	supporting anthropogenic climate change.
133000	137000	Oreskes also found that all major scientific bodies in the United States
137000	142000	agreed that man-made gases are responsible for recent climate change.
142000	144000	But although they're few in number,
144000	147000	there are scientific papers supporting alternative hypotheses.
147000	151000	Far from ignoring them, climate scientists are very familiar with them.
151000	154000	The alternatives can be broken down into two basic ideas.
154000	158000	Firstly, the proposal that increased output from the sun is driving climate change,
158000	161000	a phenomenon known as solar forcing.
161000	165000	Secondly, the proposal that cloud cover is affecting global temperatures.
165000	168000	But first things first, nearly all climate scientists agree
168000	173000	that the Earth's climate warms and cools in concert with the varying energy output from the sun.
173000	178000	But the crucial question is whether that's the cause of the recent rise in global temperatures,
178000	181000	basically over the last 40 or 50 years.
181000	186000	27 years ago, a paper was published with very strong evidence for exactly that.
186000	190000	Egel Fries Kristensen and Knud Lassen of the Danish Meteorological Institute
190000	194000	looked at the pattern of solar activity over the last 250 years
194000	198000	and it matched almost perfectly with global temperature changes.
198000	201000	But closer examination of the data revealed a flaw.
201000	205000	To get their graph, Fries Kristensen and Lassen had to filter the data.
205000	210000	That basically means smoothing it out to account for background variation and local anomalies.
210000	214000	This is standard practice and they did that for most of the graph.
214000	217000	But they didn't do it for the most recent part of the graph
217000	221000	because the data needed to do it wasn't available at the time of publication.
221000	225000	When it did become available, the graph showed a very different story.
225000	229000	A very good correlation between global temperatures and solar output
229000	231000	over most of the last 250 years,
231000	236000	but not the very period that covers a dramatic rise in global temperatures.
236000	241000	While global temperatures have been rising, solar activity has remained more or less static.
242000	246000	Since the 1991 paper, a number of other research papers have been written
246000	250000	and nearly all confirmed what the revised Fries Kristensen-Lassen graph showed.
250000	255000	Solar activity explains most of the temperature changes over the last few hundred years,
255000	258000	but not the recent period of rising global temperatures.
258000	262000	But there's one more thing to check before discounting solar forcing as an option.
262000	266000	All the historical data measuring the amount of solar energy falling on the Earth
266000	268000	are derived by secondary methods.
268000	273000	Sunspot counts, levels of carbon-14 and beryllium-10, for example.
273000	277000	To get a measure of the Sun's exact output, you have to go into space,
277000	280000	away from all the meteorological clutter on Earth.
280000	284000	So in the early 2000s, several researchers looked at the satellite data,
284000	288000	which measures something called the TSI, total solar irradiance.
288000	290000	But there's a problem.
290000	294000	The main satellite series they depend on for their data is called ACRIM.
294000	299000	The first ACRIM satellite, ACRIM-1, was in orbit from 1980 to 1989,
299000	302000	when it was due to be replaced by ACRIM-2.
302000	305000	But then the Challenger disaster happened,
305000	308000	and ACRIM-2 didn't get launched for another two years.
308000	310000	So there's a gap in the data.
310000	314000	And exactly where the gap occurs, there's an apparent jump in the TSI.
314000	319000	Richard Wilson of Columbia University, who helped devise the ACRIM equipment,
319000	322000	made up for the gap by looking at data from another satellite,
322000	324000	which confirmed the increase.
324000	331000	Wilson derived a small increase of total solar irradiance of 0.05% per decade.
331000	334000	But Judith Lean of the Naval Research Laboratory in Washington,
334000	339000	using data from another satellite, found no increase in solar output,
339000	345000	and other researchers confirmed that with measurements of ultraviolet radiation and sunspot counts.
345000	351000	A third satellite even showed a decrease in TSI during what's become known as the ACRIM gap.
351000	357000	But most climatologists say even if the ACRIM increase is real, it's too small to be significant,
357000	362000	about the same order of variation we get in a typical 11-year solar cycle.
362000	368000	This was also the conclusion of a review in the magazine Nature, which looked at all the varying data.
368000	372000	The bottom line on solar forcing is that a lot of studies have been done,
372000	375000	and this is far from an issue that's being ignored.
375000	379000	Output from the sun is an important factor driving the Earth's climate.
379000	383000	But climate scientists say that although there have been fluctuations,
383000	388000	there's been no significant increase in solar output over the last 40 years.
388000	393000	Solar forcing simply doesn't explain the recent dramatic rise in global temperatures.
393000	399000	So what about the other objection to anthropogenic climate change focusing on cloud formation?
399000	402000	This can be divided into two basic hypotheses.
402000	405000	The first suggests that cosmic rays seed clouds.
406000	411000	When solar activity increases, particles from the sun keep these cosmic rays away from the Earth,
411000	413000	and that reduces cloud cover.
413000	417000	With less cloud to reflect sunlight, the Earth warms up.
417000	422000	The idea was proposed in 1997 by Fris Christiansen and Henrik Svensmark.
422000	425000	They backed up their hypothesis with satellite data,
425000	428000	showing a correlation between low-atmosphere cloud cover
428000	434000	and the intensity of cosmic rays arriving at the Earth between 1980 and 1995.
435000	440000	It's an interesting idea, and one that's been seriously looked at by a number of climate scientists,
440000	442000	but only a few supported.
442000	445000	The most obvious problem is that the hypothesis once again
445000	449000	hinges on increased solar output over the last 40 years,
449000	452000	and climate scientists say that hasn't been happening.
452000	455000	If that's the case, why the apparent correlation?
455000	459000	Two researchers writing in the journal Astronomy and Geophysics
459000	465000	studied this further and discovered that the correlation in fact breaks down after 1991.
465000	469000	And any correlation that does exist may be difficult to pin down
469000	472000	because of the age-old problem of cause and effect.
472000	475000	The second idea on cloud cover comes from Richard Linson
475000	478000	of the Department of Meteorology at MIT.
478000	483000	He postulates that warmer tropical oceans result in fewer high-altitude cirrus clouds.
483000	489000	Fewer clouds mean more infrared radiation can escape into space, cooling the Earth down.
489000	492000	In other words, the Earth has a self-regulating mechanism.
492000	496000	Linson calls this the Infrared Iris Hypothesis.
496000	499000	Before I look at this, let me clear something up.
499000	504000	Linson says fewer clouds cool the Earth down because clouds trap heat.
504000	508000	Fritz Christensen and Svensmarck argue that fewer clouds warm the Earth up
508000	510000	because clouds reflect sunlight.
510000	513000	Well, this whole area is a bit tricky. Clouds do both.
513000	519000	When planes were grounded across the United States following the 9-11 attacks in 2001,
519000	523000	American skies were suddenly clear of contrails for three days.
523000	529000	Contrails form high-altitude clouds, so this was a unique opportunity to study their effect.
529000	532000	Scientists from the University of Wisconsin and Penn State
532000	536000	analyzed temperatures for the three days before and after 9-11.
536000	540000	They found that daytime temperatures rose by a little less than one degree
540000	544000	thanks to the disappearance of the contrails that no longer block the sun.
544000	547000	But nighttime temperatures fell by an equal amount
547000	551000	because the contrail cloud cover was no longer there to act as a blanket,
551000	554000	preventing the escape of infrared radiation into space.
554000	558000	Bing Lin, an atmospheric research scientist at NASA,
558000	561000	found that instead of cooling the Earth, as Linson had predicted,
562000	566000	the effect of fewer cirrus clouds in the tropics is to very slightly warm it.
566000	570000	Lin also couldn't replicate Linson's results on increased cirrus cloud formation
570000	572000	and he soon found out why.
572000	575000	Linson had chosen to base his model around Indonesia,
575000	578000	which has the warmest pool of water on the planet,
578000	581000	so it's not typical of the tropics.
581000	583000	Lin found that over the tropics as a whole,
583000	586000	the increase in cirrus cloud cover from warmer temperatures
586000	589000	is much less than Linson had predicted.
589000	592000	There are other factors affecting the Earth's climate,
592000	594000	most notably volcanic eruptions,
594000	597000	but climate scientists agree that this isn't a significant factor
597000	600000	in the current period of global warming.
600000	603000	This and the previous video covered the science of global warming
603000	606000	and the scientific debate among experts.
606000	610000	In the next video we'll descend into something far easier to unravel,
610000	614000	the urban myth swamp, as we try to sort out fact from fiction
614000	617000	and track misinformation back to its source.
