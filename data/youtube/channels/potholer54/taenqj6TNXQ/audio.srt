1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,360
If you don't recognise him, this is Buddy Davis, a Golden Crocoduck nominee from 2011

2
00:00:06,360 --> 00:00:11,160
who won the nomination for this extraordinary claim in his film The Creation Adventure

3
00:00:11,160 --> 00:00:12,160
Team.

4
00:00:12,160 --> 00:00:19,600
We found and brought back over 200 pounds of dinosaur bones here to be unfossilised.

5
00:00:19,600 --> 00:00:21,060
What an adventure indeed.

6
00:00:21,060 --> 00:00:26,080
The funky editing was done by the makers of his film, not me, but what Davis said is that

7
00:00:26,080 --> 00:00:32,260
he recovered 200 pounds of what appear to be unfossilised dinosaur bones from Alaska.

8
00:00:32,260 --> 00:00:36,720
The adventure he was referring to is recounted here, in a website that was something of an

9
00:00:36,720 --> 00:00:39,400
early Christmas present for me.

10
00:00:39,400 --> 00:00:44,080
Davis has often referred to this exciting adventure to the Liskin Bone Bed in Alaska,

11
00:00:44,080 --> 00:00:48,940
but I was delighted to find a detailed account of the entire trip on a website including

12
00:00:48,940 --> 00:00:54,480
the discovery of what Davis says appear to be unfossilised dinosaur bones.

13
00:00:54,480 --> 00:00:58,760
Interestingly on the website, the bones transform from being what appear to be unfossilised

14
00:00:58,760 --> 00:01:06,520
dinosaur bones to being unambiguously unfossilised dinosaur bones, Buddy, a musician and sculptor,

15
00:01:06,520 --> 00:01:09,520
transforms into a creation scientist.

16
00:01:09,520 --> 00:01:14,400
The Alaska Adventure is now a book, and I do hope Buddy makes this into a film.

17
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:19,380
It'll be a sort of Deliverance Meets the Keystone Cops, because from first to last

18
00:01:19,380 --> 00:01:23,240
the expedition was dogged by mishaps and bad planning.

19
00:01:23,240 --> 00:01:27,760
So much so that Buddy and his buddies had to constantly ask the Lord for help.

20
00:01:27,760 --> 00:01:35,360
I'll let the journal speak for itself.

21
00:01:35,360 --> 00:01:39,640
After a year of planning, our exploration of the Liskin Bone Bed on the north slope

22
00:01:39,640 --> 00:01:42,800
of Alaska was finally right around the corner.

23
00:01:42,800 --> 00:01:47,640
In this place were frozen, unfossilised dinosaur bones.

24
00:01:47,640 --> 00:01:52,120
We paid $1,000 to rent three small rafts, life jackets and paddles.

25
00:01:52,120 --> 00:01:54,680
Quickly we were off to the Colville River.

26
00:01:54,680 --> 00:02:00,500
We loaded our rafts, said our goodbyes and began our journey.

27
00:02:00,500 --> 00:02:05,360
Now how long into the trip do you think it'll be before Buddy sends out his first May Day?

28
00:02:05,360 --> 00:02:06,360
Five days?

29
00:02:06,360 --> 00:02:07,360
A week?

30
00:02:07,360 --> 00:02:08,360
Fifteen hours?

31
00:02:08,360 --> 00:02:09,360
Nope.

32
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:12,040
May Day, May Day.

33
00:02:12,040 --> 00:02:16,560
Within fifteen minutes of our departure onto the Colville, Buddy and Dan's raft was out

34
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:17,840
of sight.

35
00:02:17,840 --> 00:02:22,680
Without warning, Mike and George's raft suddenly began to sink.

36
00:02:22,680 --> 00:02:27,360
It was certainly only because of God's help that they were able to get to the shore before

37
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:28,960
a certain catastrophe.

38
00:02:28,960 --> 00:02:34,940
No, Buddy, God's trying to tell you that this ill-fated journey of yours is a complete farce.

39
00:02:34,940 --> 00:02:38,800
If you can't even keep together and one of your canoes starts sinking within fifteen

40
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:43,520
minutes of your departure, then either God isn't looking after you very well or he's

41
00:02:43,520 --> 00:02:48,600
trying to tell you to go home to Ohio.

42
00:02:48,600 --> 00:02:53,680
On the second day, Buddy and his buddies didn't fare much better, getting separated once again

43
00:02:53,680 --> 00:02:56,380
and they haven't even got to the bone beds yet.

44
00:02:56,380 --> 00:02:59,480
So when do we get to see some dinosaur bones, guys?

45
00:02:59,480 --> 00:03:01,100
Oh, Day Three.

46
00:03:01,100 --> 00:03:06,760
They pull a bone out of the river.

47
00:03:06,760 --> 00:03:12,160
Buddy reached out of the raft and hauled the eighty pound specimen into the boat.

48
00:03:12,160 --> 00:03:17,600
The specimen Buddy hauled in turned out to be the jaw of a duck-billed dinosaur we have

49
00:03:17,600 --> 00:03:21,480
temporarily identified as Lambiosaurus.

50
00:03:21,480 --> 00:03:26,800
We were all praising the Lord that we had been allowed to find something so amazing.

51
00:03:26,800 --> 00:03:28,640
How do they know it's Lambiosaurus?

52
00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:30,640
Answer, they don't.

53
00:03:30,640 --> 00:03:36,160
None of the guys on the expedition is a paleontologist, let alone an expert in identifying dinosaur

54
00:03:36,160 --> 00:03:37,160
bones.

55
00:03:37,160 --> 00:03:42,440
All we have to rely on is their keen eye and amateur knowledge, which don't seem all that

56
00:03:42,440 --> 00:03:43,440
impressive.

57
00:03:43,440 --> 00:03:46,720
All of a sudden, Buddy became very excited.

58
00:03:46,720 --> 00:03:49,320
He had also found something in the mud.

59
00:03:49,320 --> 00:03:52,400
It appeared as though we had found a long limb bone.

60
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:58,520
It was too good to be true, but it was digging out a piece of driftwood.

61
00:03:58,520 --> 00:04:04,400
As I lie in bed, I hear various sounds, the mosquitoes outside, cliff rubble periodically

62
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:10,480
crashing into the river, gurgling muddy river rapids, and falcons nesting high above us

63
00:04:10,480 --> 00:04:12,840
as they cry like baby kittens.

64
00:04:12,840 --> 00:04:23,840
George is quietly singing praises to our mighty creator.

65
00:04:23,840 --> 00:04:33,440
Thanks Lord for your perfect timing and giving us the privilege to do your work.

66
00:04:33,480 --> 00:04:38,440
With our GPS and direct coordinates, we easily found the Liskin bone bed.

67
00:04:38,440 --> 00:04:42,160
We found both fossilized and unfossilized bones.

68
00:04:42,160 --> 00:04:47,120
It was the frozen unfossilized bones we were seeking for our research, although we collected

69
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:49,520
some fossilized bones as well.

70
00:04:49,520 --> 00:04:52,600
Within two hours, we had plenty of bones for our project.

71
00:04:52,600 --> 00:04:54,980
The Lord sure has been good.

72
00:04:54,980 --> 00:04:57,480
He has provided everything we have found.

73
00:04:57,520 --> 00:05:09,320
After collecting, we had a prayer of thanksgiving and praise for our wonderful creator.

74
00:05:09,320 --> 00:05:12,720
The boats had taken on quite a bit of water because of the large waves.

75
00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:17,760
Our duffels were soaked on outside and lying in the water in the bottoms of our boats.

76
00:05:17,760 --> 00:05:22,600
By 9.30 pm, all of us were wet, tired, shivering and hungry.

77
00:05:22,600 --> 00:05:26,240
We were exhausted and could go no further.

78
00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:27,240
Then it happened.

79
00:05:27,240 --> 00:05:32,160
I spotted two Eskimo speedboats heading downriver towards Nooksuk.

80
00:05:32,160 --> 00:05:39,080
After offering them $50, they agreed to tow us the rest of the way to Nooksuk that night.

81
00:05:39,080 --> 00:05:41,960
It was almost as if they were angels sent from God.

82
00:05:46,520 --> 00:05:48,720
OK, reality check buddy.

83
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:53,400
What appear to be unfossilized dinosaur bones as you describe them, haven't been looked

84
00:05:53,400 --> 00:05:58,480
at or analyzed by a single expert since you brought them back three years ago.

85
00:05:58,480 --> 00:06:02,360
If this is such a stupendous find, why the secrecy?

86
00:06:02,360 --> 00:06:07,360
Your exciting adventure started with a sinking canoe and ended with a rescue, and it wasn't

87
00:06:07,360 --> 00:06:11,560
God who saved you, it was a couple of Inuit in a passing boat.

88
00:06:11,560 --> 00:06:15,800
If they hadn't given you a tow back, you'd have wasted taxpayers' money asking to be

89
00:06:15,800 --> 00:06:18,100
rescued by the local coastguard.

90
00:06:18,100 --> 00:06:23,740
In short, the entire expedition was a disorganized waste of time that didn't result in a single

91
00:06:23,740 --> 00:06:25,620
significant find.

92
00:06:25,620 --> 00:06:28,340
Just a few bags of unidentified bones.

93
00:06:28,340 --> 00:06:32,660
Whether they're dinosaurs or mammoths or moose, who knows?

94
00:06:32,660 --> 00:06:35,140
But the expedition has achieved something.

95
00:06:35,140 --> 00:06:37,740
It's given the rest of us a good laugh.

96
00:06:37,740 --> 00:06:38,740
Thanks buddy.

97
00:06:38,740 --> 00:06:43,760
Just full 6pm, we left Nooksuk on our bush plane flight back to Fairbanks.

98
00:06:43,760 --> 00:06:47,980
As we viewed the winding river below, we had a flood of memories.

99
00:06:47,980 --> 00:06:53,140
Nothing we had gone through to collect a few dinosaur bones seemed unreal now.

100
00:06:53,140 --> 00:06:56,540
The bones must have something special in them.

101
00:06:56,540 --> 00:07:00,780
Tears came to our eyes as we were reminded of the awesome God we served.
