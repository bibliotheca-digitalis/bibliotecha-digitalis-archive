00:00.000 --> 00:06.360
If you don't recognise him, this is Buddy Davis, a Golden Crocoduck nominee from 2011

00:06.360 --> 00:11.160
who won the nomination for this extraordinary claim in his film The Creation Adventure

00:11.160 --> 00:12.160
Team.

00:12.160 --> 00:19.600
We found and brought back over 200 pounds of dinosaur bones here to be unfossilised.

00:19.600 --> 00:21.060
What an adventure indeed.

00:21.060 --> 00:26.080
The funky editing was done by the makers of his film, not me, but what Davis said is that

00:26.080 --> 00:32.260
he recovered 200 pounds of what appear to be unfossilised dinosaur bones from Alaska.

00:32.260 --> 00:36.720
The adventure he was referring to is recounted here, in a website that was something of an

00:36.720 --> 00:39.400
early Christmas present for me.

00:39.400 --> 00:44.080
Davis has often referred to this exciting adventure to the Liskin Bone Bed in Alaska,

00:44.080 --> 00:48.940
but I was delighted to find a detailed account of the entire trip on a website including

00:48.940 --> 00:54.480
the discovery of what Davis says appear to be unfossilised dinosaur bones.

00:54.480 --> 00:58.760
Interestingly on the website, the bones transform from being what appear to be unfossilised

00:58.760 --> 01:06.520
dinosaur bones to being unambiguously unfossilised dinosaur bones, Buddy, a musician and sculptor,

01:06.520 --> 01:09.520
transforms into a creation scientist.

01:09.520 --> 01:14.400
The Alaska Adventure is now a book, and I do hope Buddy makes this into a film.

01:14.400 --> 01:19.380
It'll be a sort of Deliverance Meets the Keystone Cops, because from first to last

01:19.380 --> 01:23.240
the expedition was dogged by mishaps and bad planning.

01:23.240 --> 01:27.760
So much so that Buddy and his buddies had to constantly ask the Lord for help.

01:27.760 --> 01:35.360
I'll let the journal speak for itself.

01:35.360 --> 01:39.640
After a year of planning, our exploration of the Liskin Bone Bed on the north slope

01:39.640 --> 01:42.800
of Alaska was finally right around the corner.

01:42.800 --> 01:47.640
In this place were frozen, unfossilised dinosaur bones.

01:47.640 --> 01:52.120
We paid $1,000 to rent three small rafts, life jackets and paddles.

01:52.120 --> 01:54.680
Quickly we were off to the Colville River.

01:54.680 --> 02:00.500
We loaded our rafts, said our goodbyes and began our journey.

02:00.500 --> 02:05.360
Now how long into the trip do you think it'll be before Buddy sends out his first May Day?

02:05.360 --> 02:06.360
Five days?

02:06.360 --> 02:07.360
A week?

02:07.360 --> 02:08.360
Fifteen hours?

02:08.360 --> 02:09.360
Nope.

02:09.360 --> 02:12.040
May Day, May Day.

02:12.040 --> 02:16.560
Within fifteen minutes of our departure onto the Colville, Buddy and Dan's raft was out

02:16.560 --> 02:17.840
of sight.

02:17.840 --> 02:22.680
Without warning, Mike and George's raft suddenly began to sink.

02:22.680 --> 02:27.360
It was certainly only because of God's help that they were able to get to the shore before

02:27.360 --> 02:28.960
a certain catastrophe.

02:28.960 --> 02:34.940
No, Buddy, God's trying to tell you that this ill-fated journey of yours is a complete farce.

02:34.940 --> 02:38.800
If you can't even keep together and one of your canoes starts sinking within fifteen

02:38.800 --> 02:43.520
minutes of your departure, then either God isn't looking after you very well or he's

02:43.520 --> 02:48.600
trying to tell you to go home to Ohio.

02:48.600 --> 02:53.680
On the second day, Buddy and his buddies didn't fare much better, getting separated once again

02:53.680 --> 02:56.380
and they haven't even got to the bone beds yet.

02:56.380 --> 02:59.480
So when do we get to see some dinosaur bones, guys?

02:59.480 --> 03:01.100
Oh, Day Three.

03:01.100 --> 03:06.760
They pull a bone out of the river.

03:06.760 --> 03:12.160
Buddy reached out of the raft and hauled the eighty pound specimen into the boat.

03:12.160 --> 03:17.600
The specimen Buddy hauled in turned out to be the jaw of a duck-billed dinosaur we have

03:17.600 --> 03:21.480
temporarily identified as Lambiosaurus.

03:21.480 --> 03:26.800
We were all praising the Lord that we had been allowed to find something so amazing.

03:26.800 --> 03:28.640
How do they know it's Lambiosaurus?

03:28.640 --> 03:30.640
Answer, they don't.

03:30.640 --> 03:36.160
None of the guys on the expedition is a paleontologist, let alone an expert in identifying dinosaur

03:36.160 --> 03:37.160
bones.

03:37.160 --> 03:42.440
All we have to rely on is their keen eye and amateur knowledge, which don't seem all that

03:42.440 --> 03:43.440
impressive.

03:43.440 --> 03:46.720
All of a sudden, Buddy became very excited.

03:46.720 --> 03:49.320
He had also found something in the mud.

03:49.320 --> 03:52.400
It appeared as though we had found a long limb bone.

03:52.400 --> 03:58.520
It was too good to be true, but it was digging out a piece of driftwood.

03:58.520 --> 04:04.400
As I lie in bed, I hear various sounds, the mosquitoes outside, cliff rubble periodically

04:04.400 --> 04:10.480
crashing into the river, gurgling muddy river rapids, and falcons nesting high above us

04:10.480 --> 04:12.840
as they cry like baby kittens.

04:12.840 --> 04:23.840
George is quietly singing praises to our mighty creator.

04:23.840 --> 04:33.440
Thanks Lord for your perfect timing and giving us the privilege to do your work.

04:33.480 --> 04:38.440
With our GPS and direct coordinates, we easily found the Liskin bone bed.

04:38.440 --> 04:42.160
We found both fossilized and unfossilized bones.

04:42.160 --> 04:47.120
It was the frozen unfossilized bones we were seeking for our research, although we collected

04:47.120 --> 04:49.520
some fossilized bones as well.

04:49.520 --> 04:52.600
Within two hours, we had plenty of bones for our project.

04:52.600 --> 04:54.980
The Lord sure has been good.

04:54.980 --> 04:57.480
He has provided everything we have found.

04:57.520 --> 05:09.320
After collecting, we had a prayer of thanksgiving and praise for our wonderful creator.

05:09.320 --> 05:12.720
The boats had taken on quite a bit of water because of the large waves.

05:12.720 --> 05:17.760
Our duffels were soaked on outside and lying in the water in the bottoms of our boats.

05:17.760 --> 05:22.600
By 9.30 pm, all of us were wet, tired, shivering and hungry.

05:22.600 --> 05:26.240
We were exhausted and could go no further.

05:26.240 --> 05:27.240
Then it happened.

05:27.240 --> 05:32.160
I spotted two Eskimo speedboats heading downriver towards Nooksuk.

05:32.160 --> 05:39.080
After offering them $50, they agreed to tow us the rest of the way to Nooksuk that night.

05:39.080 --> 05:41.960
It was almost as if they were angels sent from God.

05:46.520 --> 05:48.720
OK, reality check buddy.

05:48.720 --> 05:53.400
What appear to be unfossilized dinosaur bones as you describe them, haven't been looked

05:53.400 --> 05:58.480
at or analyzed by a single expert since you brought them back three years ago.

05:58.480 --> 06:02.360
If this is such a stupendous find, why the secrecy?

06:02.360 --> 06:07.360
Your exciting adventure started with a sinking canoe and ended with a rescue, and it wasn't

06:07.360 --> 06:11.560
God who saved you, it was a couple of Inuit in a passing boat.

06:11.560 --> 06:15.800
If they hadn't given you a tow back, you'd have wasted taxpayers' money asking to be

06:15.800 --> 06:18.100
rescued by the local coastguard.

06:18.100 --> 06:23.740
In short, the entire expedition was a disorganized waste of time that didn't result in a single

06:23.740 --> 06:25.620
significant find.

06:25.620 --> 06:28.340
Just a few bags of unidentified bones.

06:28.340 --> 06:32.660
Whether they're dinosaurs or mammoths or moose, who knows?

06:32.660 --> 06:35.140
But the expedition has achieved something.

06:35.140 --> 06:37.740
It's given the rest of us a good laugh.

06:37.740 --> 06:38.740
Thanks buddy.

06:38.740 --> 06:43.760
Just full 6pm, we left Nooksuk on our bush plane flight back to Fairbanks.

06:43.760 --> 06:47.980
As we viewed the winding river below, we had a flood of memories.

06:47.980 --> 06:53.140
Nothing we had gone through to collect a few dinosaur bones seemed unreal now.

06:53.140 --> 06:56.540
The bones must have something special in them.

06:56.540 --> 07:00.780
Tears came to our eyes as we were reminded of the awesome God we served.
