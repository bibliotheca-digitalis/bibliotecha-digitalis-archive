0	6360	If you don't recognise him, this is Buddy Davis, a Golden Crocoduck nominee from 2011
6360	11160	who won the nomination for this extraordinary claim in his film The Creation Adventure
11160	12160	Team.
12160	19600	We found and brought back over 200 pounds of dinosaur bones here to be unfossilised.
19600	21060	What an adventure indeed.
21060	26080	The funky editing was done by the makers of his film, not me, but what Davis said is that
26080	32260	he recovered 200 pounds of what appear to be unfossilised dinosaur bones from Alaska.
32260	36720	The adventure he was referring to is recounted here, in a website that was something of an
36720	39400	early Christmas present for me.
39400	44080	Davis has often referred to this exciting adventure to the Liskin Bone Bed in Alaska,
44080	48940	but I was delighted to find a detailed account of the entire trip on a website including
48940	54480	the discovery of what Davis says appear to be unfossilised dinosaur bones.
54480	58760	Interestingly on the website, the bones transform from being what appear to be unfossilised
58760	66520	dinosaur bones to being unambiguously unfossilised dinosaur bones, Buddy, a musician and sculptor,
66520	69520	transforms into a creation scientist.
69520	74400	The Alaska Adventure is now a book, and I do hope Buddy makes this into a film.
74400	79380	It'll be a sort of Deliverance Meets the Keystone Cops, because from first to last
79380	83240	the expedition was dogged by mishaps and bad planning.
83240	87760	So much so that Buddy and his buddies had to constantly ask the Lord for help.
87760	95360	I'll let the journal speak for itself.
95360	99640	After a year of planning, our exploration of the Liskin Bone Bed on the north slope
99640	102800	of Alaska was finally right around the corner.
102800	107640	In this place were frozen, unfossilised dinosaur bones.
107640	112120	We paid $1,000 to rent three small rafts, life jackets and paddles.
112120	114680	Quickly we were off to the Colville River.
114680	120500	We loaded our rafts, said our goodbyes and began our journey.
120500	125360	Now how long into the trip do you think it'll be before Buddy sends out his first May Day?
125360	126360	Five days?
126360	127360	A week?
127360	128360	Fifteen hours?
128360	129360	Nope.
129360	132040	May Day, May Day.
132040	136560	Within fifteen minutes of our departure onto the Colville, Buddy and Dan's raft was out
136560	137840	of sight.
137840	142680	Without warning, Mike and George's raft suddenly began to sink.
142680	147360	It was certainly only because of God's help that they were able to get to the shore before
147360	148960	a certain catastrophe.
148960	154940	No, Buddy, God's trying to tell you that this ill-fated journey of yours is a complete farce.
154940	158800	If you can't even keep together and one of your canoes starts sinking within fifteen
158800	163520	minutes of your departure, then either God isn't looking after you very well or he's
163520	168600	trying to tell you to go home to Ohio.
168600	173680	On the second day, Buddy and his buddies didn't fare much better, getting separated once again
173680	176380	and they haven't even got to the bone beds yet.
176380	179480	So when do we get to see some dinosaur bones, guys?
179480	181100	Oh, Day Three.
181100	186760	They pull a bone out of the river.
186760	192160	Buddy reached out of the raft and hauled the eighty pound specimen into the boat.
192160	197600	The specimen Buddy hauled in turned out to be the jaw of a duck-billed dinosaur we have
197600	201480	temporarily identified as Lambiosaurus.
201480	206800	We were all praising the Lord that we had been allowed to find something so amazing.
206800	208640	How do they know it's Lambiosaurus?
208640	210640	Answer, they don't.
210640	216160	None of the guys on the expedition is a paleontologist, let alone an expert in identifying dinosaur
216160	217160	bones.
217160	222440	All we have to rely on is their keen eye and amateur knowledge, which don't seem all that
222440	223440	impressive.
223440	226720	All of a sudden, Buddy became very excited.
226720	229320	He had also found something in the mud.
229320	232400	It appeared as though we had found a long limb bone.
232400	238520	It was too good to be true, but it was digging out a piece of driftwood.
238520	244400	As I lie in bed, I hear various sounds, the mosquitoes outside, cliff rubble periodically
244400	250480	crashing into the river, gurgling muddy river rapids, and falcons nesting high above us
250480	252840	as they cry like baby kittens.
252840	263840	George is quietly singing praises to our mighty creator.
263840	273440	Thanks Lord for your perfect timing and giving us the privilege to do your work.
273480	278440	With our GPS and direct coordinates, we easily found the Liskin bone bed.
278440	282160	We found both fossilized and unfossilized bones.
282160	287120	It was the frozen unfossilized bones we were seeking for our research, although we collected
287120	289520	some fossilized bones as well.
289520	292600	Within two hours, we had plenty of bones for our project.
292600	294980	The Lord sure has been good.
294980	297480	He has provided everything we have found.
297520	309320	After collecting, we had a prayer of thanksgiving and praise for our wonderful creator.
309320	312720	The boats had taken on quite a bit of water because of the large waves.
312720	317760	Our duffels were soaked on outside and lying in the water in the bottoms of our boats.
317760	322600	By 9.30 pm, all of us were wet, tired, shivering and hungry.
322600	326240	We were exhausted and could go no further.
326240	327240	Then it happened.
327240	332160	I spotted two Eskimo speedboats heading downriver towards Nooksuk.
332160	339080	After offering them $50, they agreed to tow us the rest of the way to Nooksuk that night.
339080	341960	It was almost as if they were angels sent from God.
346520	348720	OK, reality check buddy.
348720	353400	What appear to be unfossilized dinosaur bones as you describe them, haven't been looked
353400	358480	at or analyzed by a single expert since you brought them back three years ago.
358480	362360	If this is such a stupendous find, why the secrecy?
362360	367360	Your exciting adventure started with a sinking canoe and ended with a rescue, and it wasn't
367360	371560	God who saved you, it was a couple of Inuit in a passing boat.
371560	375800	If they hadn't given you a tow back, you'd have wasted taxpayers' money asking to be
375800	378100	rescued by the local coastguard.
378100	383740	In short, the entire expedition was a disorganized waste of time that didn't result in a single
383740	385620	significant find.
385620	388340	Just a few bags of unidentified bones.
388340	392660	Whether they're dinosaurs or mammoths or moose, who knows?
392660	395140	But the expedition has achieved something.
395140	397740	It's given the rest of us a good laugh.
397740	398740	Thanks buddy.
398740	403760	Just full 6pm, we left Nooksuk on our bush plane flight back to Fairbanks.
403760	407980	As we viewed the winding river below, we had a flood of memories.
407980	413140	Nothing we had gone through to collect a few dinosaur bones seemed unreal now.
413140	416540	The bones must have something special in them.
416540	420780	Tears came to our eyes as we were reminded of the awesome God we served.
