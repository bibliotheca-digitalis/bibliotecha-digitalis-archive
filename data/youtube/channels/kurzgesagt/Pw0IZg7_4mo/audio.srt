The moons of Mars explained.

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:07,000
Mars has two moons, Phobos and Deimos.

3
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:09,000
They are really tiny.

4
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:11,000
How tiny?

5
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:15,000
Compared to Mars or our own moon, pretty tiny.

6
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:18,000
Although, tiny is a matter of opinion.

7
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:22,000
Their surface areas are close to some of the smallest states on Earth,

8
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:24,000
like Luxembourg and Malta.

9
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:28,000
Although Phobos and Deimos are in no way lightweight,

10
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:33,000
in reality, their gravitational pull isn't even strong enough to bring them into spherical form,

11
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:37,000
so they look more like huge potatoes than moons.

12
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:42,000
The most popular theory of their origin is that they were once part of the asteroid belt

13
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:48,000
until Jupiter's massive gravity kicked them out of it, so Mars could catch them.

14
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:56,000
Phobos orbits Mars at an average distance of 9,400 kilometers once every seven and a half hours.

15
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:01,000
It's on a collision course and gets two meters closer to Mars every year.

16
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:07,000
In 50 to 100 million years, it will either be ripped to pieces by Mars' gravity

17
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:12,000
and be transformed into a beautiful ring, or it will crash into Mars.

18
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:16,000
The energy released in this collision would kill everything on the small planet,

19
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:22,000
so if there are humans on Mars by then, they should build very strong bunkers.

20
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:26,000
Smaller Deimos, on the other hand, is slowly escaping Mars.

21
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:32,000
Eventually, it will fly off into space and leave a lonely red planet behind.

22
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:37,000
So, in a few hundred million years, Mars will be moonless and on its own,

23
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:42,000
unless it manages to catch itself another asteroid.
