0	3000	The moons of Mars explained.
3000	7000	Mars has two moons, Phobos and Deimos.
7000	9000	They are really tiny.
9000	11000	How tiny?
11000	15000	Compared to Mars or our own moon, pretty tiny.
15000	18000	Although, tiny is a matter of opinion.
18000	22000	Their surface areas are close to some of the smallest states on Earth,
22000	24000	like Luxembourg and Malta.
24000	28000	Although Phobos and Deimos are in no way lightweight,
28000	33000	in reality, their gravitational pull isn't even strong enough to bring them into spherical form,
33000	37000	so they look more like huge potatoes than moons.
37000	42000	The most popular theory of their origin is that they were once part of the asteroid belt
42000	48000	until Jupiter's massive gravity kicked them out of it, so Mars could catch them.
49000	56000	Phobos orbits Mars at an average distance of 9,400 kilometers once every seven and a half hours.
56000	61000	It's on a collision course and gets two meters closer to Mars every year.
61000	67000	In 50 to 100 million years, it will either be ripped to pieces by Mars' gravity
67000	72000	and be transformed into a beautiful ring, or it will crash into Mars.
72000	76000	The energy released in this collision would kill everything on the small planet,
76000	82000	so if there are humans on Mars by then, they should build very strong bunkers.
82000	86000	Smaller Deimos, on the other hand, is slowly escaping Mars.
86000	92000	Eventually, it will fly off into space and leave a lonely red planet behind.
92000	97000	So, in a few hundred million years, Mars will be moonless and on its own,
97000	102000	unless it manages to catch itself another asteroid.
