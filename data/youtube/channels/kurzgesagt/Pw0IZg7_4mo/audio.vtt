00:00.000 --> 00:03.000
The moons of Mars explained.

00:03.000 --> 00:07.000
Mars has two moons, Phobos and Deimos.

00:07.000 --> 00:09.000
They are really tiny.

00:09.000 --> 00:11.000
How tiny?

00:11.000 --> 00:15.000
Compared to Mars or our own moon, pretty tiny.

00:15.000 --> 00:18.000
Although, tiny is a matter of opinion.

00:18.000 --> 00:22.000
Their surface areas are close to some of the smallest states on Earth,

00:22.000 --> 00:24.000
like Luxembourg and Malta.

00:24.000 --> 00:28.000
Although Phobos and Deimos are in no way lightweight,

00:28.000 --> 00:33.000
in reality, their gravitational pull isn't even strong enough to bring them into spherical form,

00:33.000 --> 00:37.000
so they look more like huge potatoes than moons.

00:37.000 --> 00:42.000
The most popular theory of their origin is that they were once part of the asteroid belt

00:42.000 --> 00:48.000
until Jupiter's massive gravity kicked them out of it, so Mars could catch them.

00:49.000 --> 00:56.000
Phobos orbits Mars at an average distance of 9,400 kilometers once every seven and a half hours.

00:56.000 --> 01:01.000
It's on a collision course and gets two meters closer to Mars every year.

01:01.000 --> 01:07.000
In 50 to 100 million years, it will either be ripped to pieces by Mars' gravity

01:07.000 --> 01:12.000
and be transformed into a beautiful ring, or it will crash into Mars.

01:12.000 --> 01:16.000
The energy released in this collision would kill everything on the small planet,

01:16.000 --> 01:22.000
so if there are humans on Mars by then, they should build very strong bunkers.

01:22.000 --> 01:26.000
Smaller Deimos, on the other hand, is slowly escaping Mars.

01:26.000 --> 01:32.000
Eventually, it will fly off into space and leave a lonely red planet behind.

01:32.000 --> 01:37.000
So, in a few hundred million years, Mars will be moonless and on its own,

01:37.000 --> 01:42.000
unless it manages to catch itself another asteroid.
