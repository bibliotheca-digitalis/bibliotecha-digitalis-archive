0	6000	Wrapping your mind around your life is pretty hard because you're up to your neck in it.
6000	10000	It's like trying to understand the ocean while learning how to swim.
10000	13000	On most days, you're busy just keeping your head above water,
13000	18000	so it's not easy to figure out what to do with your life and how to spend your time.
18000	21000	There are a million distractions.
21000	26000	Your family, friends and romantic partners, boring work and exciting projects,
26000	29000	video games to play and books to read.
29000	33000	And then there's your couch that somebody needs to lie on.
33000	40000	It's easy to get lost, so let's take a step back and look at your life from the outside.
49000	53000	The average Kurzgesagt viewer is around 25 years old,
53000	56000	which is a pretty good time in the life of most people.
56000	59000	The insecurities of the teenage years have begun to recede.
59000	63000	Maybe you find yourself in a job or a long-term relationship.
63000	67000	Maybe you've started a family or are working on an advanced degree.
67000	72000	Maybe you're not doing any of that and still want to enjoy life, whatever that means to you.
72000	77000	Or maybe you feel stuck and don't know where to go yet.
77000	81000	About 1 in 20 people watching this video will get to live to 100.
82000	84000	Let's assume you are one of the lucky ones,
84000	90000	which means you had a total of 5,200 weeks of life at your disposal when you were born.
90000	95000	You spent the first 600 weeks of your life being a kid and 400 being a teenager.
95000	101000	During this time, you were pretty useless for society and also not very free to make your own decisions.
101000	106000	As a payoff, you were somewhat spared from the consequences and responsibilities of adulthood,
106000	112000	mostly because well-meaning adults protected you by cleaning up your mess and giving you time to find yourself.
112000	117000	This time is necessary to make you, at least in theory, a functioning human,
117000	120000	although most people probably don't feel like that after puberty.
120000	127000	In any case, by the time you're 20, over 1,000 of your 5,200 weeks have passed.
127000	133000	Depending on what you aspire to, at this point you're either working already or have entered further education.
133000	137000	The amount of fun you can have in this phase of your life varies a lot.
137000	143000	If you pick up a trade or need to work to support yourself or others, the serious side of life begins earlier.
143000	147000	If you go to university, you get to push back work life a bit longer.
147000	151000	In any case, most people start working for real in their 20s at the latest,
151000	157000	which begins the productive or potentially grindy or soul-crushing period of your life.
157000	160000	People tend to work until the age of 65,
160000	166000	which means that you'll spend at least 2,000 weeks of your life with serious adult work,
166000	171000	hopefully in a job that makes you feel good and appreciated or that makes the world better.
171000	179000	This is such an important thing that we'll look at work and how you can try to find a satisfying career in another video.
179000	182000	This is the main block of life for most people,
182000	188000	the time when you might have kids and travel a bit and climb the career ladder and build a house,
188000	191000	may get divorced and fall in love again.
191000	198000	In this phase, you transition from being young to middle-aged to old, not old-old, but the young-old of your 60s.
198000	204000	At 65, you've used up 3,400 of your 5,200 weeks.
204000	207000	The last phase of your life begins.
207000	210000	If you've managed to acquire enough wealth to retire,
210000	215000	in theory, you're now free to do whatever you like for up to 1,800 weeks.
215000	220000	But of course, this is not how it works for the majority of you watching this video.
220000	223000	19 out of 20 people will not live to 100.
223000	226000	The average lifespan in the US is 79.
226000	228000	In Germany, it's 81.
228000	230000	In Japan, 84.
230000	232000	In Brazil, it's 75.
233000	240000	If you die at age 80, which is still not bad, you only have 780 weeks of freedom after you retire.
240000	245000	That's roughly as many weeks of freedom as an old person as you spend as a child.
245000	250000	Unfortunately, disease and the tiredness of age trip you up here,
250000	253000	because with old age, the human body begins to decline sharply.
253000	258000	For example, the vast majority of cancer-related deaths occur in people over 70.
258000	265000	If you bet all your fun cards on being free and happy in your retirement, you might be bitterly disappointed.
265000	271000	And all of this is still assuming things work out and you even get to grow old.
271000	274000	You can drown in a pool at age 7,
274000	276000	get cancer at age 32,
276000	279000	die in a car crash at age 48,
279000	281000	you can fall from a ladder at age 60.
281000	285000	Every day, the universe rolls a bunch of dice for every human,
285000	292000	and every day, someone somewhere on this planet rolls a critical failure and their life ends that day.
292000	295000	The older you get, the more dice are rolled for you.
295000	302000	Usually, when you swim through the ocean that is your life, you don't think about all of this too much, and that's fine.
302000	308000	Life is engaging enough by itself, and the future is this undefined weird thing.
308000	313000	But thinking about it from time to time is helpful in refocusing on what you want to do,
313000	317000	and to minimize regrets you will have when you look back.
317000	323000	And to remind you that if you don't use your time today, you might not get a chance to use it tomorrow.
323000	329000	Life is complicated, and it's hard to make decisions between all the things and people that are important to you.
329000	335000	This has become painfully obvious to billions of people during the coronavirus pandemic.
335000	341000	If you respected social distancing, so many things that we took for granted were not available anymore.
341000	346000	Traveling and public places and eating out and seeing friends and meeting new people.
346000	354000	Spending time together became limited and precious, but actually, the time you have with the people you love is already precious.
354000	359000	Think of your parents. As a child, you spend basically every day with them.
359000	367000	Your time spent together begins to decline as you transition and become a teenager, and fight to develop your own identity.
367000	374000	But as teenagers, you probably still see them regularly, which changes as you enter your 20s, when most people move out.
374000	378000	For university, for work, or just to be on their own.
378000	383000	If you're making an effort to be with your parents for two full weeks each year for the rest of their lives,
383000	393000	which covers the main holidays, birthdays, and a bit extra, you still have already spent more than 90% of the time you will ever spend with them, even if they grow pretty old.
393000	398000	If they die earlier, or if you see them only a few days each year, this number shrinks even more.
398000	404000	So, in all likelihood, the vast majority of time you will ever spend with your parents has passed.
404000	410000	The same holds true for your siblings or old friends that moved to the other side of the country.
410000	415000	You're at the tail end of the time with some of the most important people in your life.
415000	420000	One day, you will see them for the last time. And it's actually the same with everything else.
420000	430000	The concept of doing something for the last time feels eerie, like something that you should only experience when you're on death row, or extremely old, or something like that.
430000	432000	But it happens all the time.
432000	436000	Is there a hobby you've been lazy about for a long time?
436000	440000	Maybe you still have those Warhammer minis that you wanted to paint.
440000	444000	Did you always want to revisit that place where you had an amazing time a decade ago?
444000	449000	Is there someone you wanted to reach out to for a long time, but haven't yet?
449000	452000	Or pick up that sport again to meet new friends?
452000	460000	Maybe you will never do any of these things again, because life gets in the way, and at some point, it's too late.
460000	467000	As the global pandemic begins to wind down, we will all soon be able to be with each other again and do fun things together.
467000	474000	It's never a bad time to reach out to a friend or a potential friend and let them know that you're looking forward to hanging out.
474000	483000	But no matter when you're watching this, our life is an incredible gift, and there are so many fun, engaging, and fulfilling things to do.
483000	487000	And you get to decide what and who matters to you.
487000	493000	But what matters the most is that you actually make decisions from time to time.
494000	504000	This video was based on and inspired by an article by our friend Tim Urban of WaitButWhy, the best blog on the internet.
504000	508000	Be sure to check it out to get more new perspectives on things.
508000	513000	Also, if you want a reminder about the things we still want to do in life, with Tim's permission,
513000	522000	we created a Kurzgesagt version of the Calendar of Your Life that lets you track how many weeks of your life you've spent already and how many you have left.
522000	527000	You can also color in the weeks to keep track of exactly how you're spending them.
527000	533000	If you're just looking for a visual reminder to put things in perspective, we've made a timeline of your life.
533000	540000	It's printed in vibrant neon colors on high-quality paper and will look great as an art piece on your wall.
540000	547000	Like all of our products, these posters were designed with love and produced with care by us here at Kurzgesagt.
547000	553000	Getting something from our shop is the best way to support our channel while getting something beautiful in return.
553000	560000	Because of you, we can keep making elaborate videos like the one you just watched and release them for free for everyone.
560000	563000	Thank you so much for your support.
