00:00.000 --> 00:06.000
Wrapping your mind around your life is pretty hard because you're up to your neck in it.

00:06.000 --> 00:10.000
It's like trying to understand the ocean while learning how to swim.

00:10.000 --> 00:13.000
On most days, you're busy just keeping your head above water,

00:13.000 --> 00:18.000
so it's not easy to figure out what to do with your life and how to spend your time.

00:18.000 --> 00:21.000
There are a million distractions.

00:21.000 --> 00:26.000
Your family, friends and romantic partners, boring work and exciting projects,

00:26.000 --> 00:29.000
video games to play and books to read.

00:29.000 --> 00:33.000
And then there's your couch that somebody needs to lie on.

00:33.000 --> 00:40.000
It's easy to get lost, so let's take a step back and look at your life from the outside.

00:49.000 --> 00:53.000
The average Kurzgesagt viewer is around 25 years old,

00:53.000 --> 00:56.000
which is a pretty good time in the life of most people.

00:56.000 --> 00:59.000
The insecurities of the teenage years have begun to recede.

00:59.000 --> 01:03.000
Maybe you find yourself in a job or a long-term relationship.

01:03.000 --> 01:07.000
Maybe you've started a family or are working on an advanced degree.

01:07.000 --> 01:12.000
Maybe you're not doing any of that and still want to enjoy life, whatever that means to you.

01:12.000 --> 01:17.000
Or maybe you feel stuck and don't know where to go yet.

01:17.000 --> 01:21.000
About 1 in 20 people watching this video will get to live to 100.

01:22.000 --> 01:24.000
Let's assume you are one of the lucky ones,

01:24.000 --> 01:30.000
which means you had a total of 5,200 weeks of life at your disposal when you were born.

01:30.000 --> 01:35.000
You spent the first 600 weeks of your life being a kid and 400 being a teenager.

01:35.000 --> 01:41.000
During this time, you were pretty useless for society and also not very free to make your own decisions.

01:41.000 --> 01:46.000
As a payoff, you were somewhat spared from the consequences and responsibilities of adulthood,

01:46.000 --> 01:52.000
mostly because well-meaning adults protected you by cleaning up your mess and giving you time to find yourself.

01:52.000 --> 01:57.000
This time is necessary to make you, at least in theory, a functioning human,

01:57.000 --> 02:00.000
although most people probably don't feel like that after puberty.

02:00.000 --> 02:07.000
In any case, by the time you're 20, over 1,000 of your 5,200 weeks have passed.

02:07.000 --> 02:13.000
Depending on what you aspire to, at this point you're either working already or have entered further education.

02:13.000 --> 02:17.000
The amount of fun you can have in this phase of your life varies a lot.

02:17.000 --> 02:23.000
If you pick up a trade or need to work to support yourself or others, the serious side of life begins earlier.

02:23.000 --> 02:27.000
If you go to university, you get to push back work life a bit longer.

02:27.000 --> 02:31.000
In any case, most people start working for real in their 20s at the latest,

02:31.000 --> 02:37.000
which begins the productive or potentially grindy or soul-crushing period of your life.

02:37.000 --> 02:40.000
People tend to work until the age of 65,

02:40.000 --> 02:46.000
which means that you'll spend at least 2,000 weeks of your life with serious adult work,

02:46.000 --> 02:51.000
hopefully in a job that makes you feel good and appreciated or that makes the world better.

02:51.000 --> 02:59.000
This is such an important thing that we'll look at work and how you can try to find a satisfying career in another video.

02:59.000 --> 03:02.000
This is the main block of life for most people,

03:02.000 --> 03:08.000
the time when you might have kids and travel a bit and climb the career ladder and build a house,

03:08.000 --> 03:11.000
may get divorced and fall in love again.

03:11.000 --> 03:18.000
In this phase, you transition from being young to middle-aged to old, not old-old, but the young-old of your 60s.

03:18.000 --> 03:24.000
At 65, you've used up 3,400 of your 5,200 weeks.

03:24.000 --> 03:27.000
The last phase of your life begins.

03:27.000 --> 03:30.000
If you've managed to acquire enough wealth to retire,

03:30.000 --> 03:35.000
in theory, you're now free to do whatever you like for up to 1,800 weeks.

03:35.000 --> 03:40.000
But of course, this is not how it works for the majority of you watching this video.

03:40.000 --> 03:43.000
19 out of 20 people will not live to 100.

03:43.000 --> 03:46.000
The average lifespan in the US is 79.

03:46.000 --> 03:48.000
In Germany, it's 81.

03:48.000 --> 03:50.000
In Japan, 84.

03:50.000 --> 03:52.000
In Brazil, it's 75.

03:53.000 --> 04:00.000
If you die at age 80, which is still not bad, you only have 780 weeks of freedom after you retire.

04:00.000 --> 04:05.000
That's roughly as many weeks of freedom as an old person as you spend as a child.

04:05.000 --> 04:10.000
Unfortunately, disease and the tiredness of age trip you up here,

04:10.000 --> 04:13.000
because with old age, the human body begins to decline sharply.

04:13.000 --> 04:18.000
For example, the vast majority of cancer-related deaths occur in people over 70.

04:18.000 --> 04:25.000
If you bet all your fun cards on being free and happy in your retirement, you might be bitterly disappointed.

04:25.000 --> 04:31.000
And all of this is still assuming things work out and you even get to grow old.

04:31.000 --> 04:34.000
You can drown in a pool at age 7,

04:34.000 --> 04:36.000
get cancer at age 32,

04:36.000 --> 04:39.000
die in a car crash at age 48,

04:39.000 --> 04:41.000
you can fall from a ladder at age 60.

04:41.000 --> 04:45.000
Every day, the universe rolls a bunch of dice for every human,

04:45.000 --> 04:52.000
and every day, someone somewhere on this planet rolls a critical failure and their life ends that day.

04:52.000 --> 04:55.000
The older you get, the more dice are rolled for you.

04:55.000 --> 05:02.000
Usually, when you swim through the ocean that is your life, you don't think about all of this too much, and that's fine.

05:02.000 --> 05:08.000
Life is engaging enough by itself, and the future is this undefined weird thing.

05:08.000 --> 05:13.000
But thinking about it from time to time is helpful in refocusing on what you want to do,

05:13.000 --> 05:17.000
and to minimize regrets you will have when you look back.

05:17.000 --> 05:23.000
And to remind you that if you don't use your time today, you might not get a chance to use it tomorrow.

05:23.000 --> 05:29.000
Life is complicated, and it's hard to make decisions between all the things and people that are important to you.

05:29.000 --> 05:35.000
This has become painfully obvious to billions of people during the coronavirus pandemic.

05:35.000 --> 05:41.000
If you respected social distancing, so many things that we took for granted were not available anymore.

05:41.000 --> 05:46.000
Traveling and public places and eating out and seeing friends and meeting new people.

05:46.000 --> 05:54.000
Spending time together became limited and precious, but actually, the time you have with the people you love is already precious.

05:54.000 --> 05:59.000
Think of your parents. As a child, you spend basically every day with them.

05:59.000 --> 06:07.000
Your time spent together begins to decline as you transition and become a teenager, and fight to develop your own identity.

06:07.000 --> 06:14.000
But as teenagers, you probably still see them regularly, which changes as you enter your 20s, when most people move out.

06:14.000 --> 06:18.000
For university, for work, or just to be on their own.

06:18.000 --> 06:23.000
If you're making an effort to be with your parents for two full weeks each year for the rest of their lives,

06:23.000 --> 06:33.000
which covers the main holidays, birthdays, and a bit extra, you still have already spent more than 90% of the time you will ever spend with them, even if they grow pretty old.

06:33.000 --> 06:38.000
If they die earlier, or if you see them only a few days each year, this number shrinks even more.

06:38.000 --> 06:44.000
So, in all likelihood, the vast majority of time you will ever spend with your parents has passed.

06:44.000 --> 06:50.000
The same holds true for your siblings or old friends that moved to the other side of the country.

06:50.000 --> 06:55.000
You're at the tail end of the time with some of the most important people in your life.

06:55.000 --> 07:00.000
One day, you will see them for the last time. And it's actually the same with everything else.

07:00.000 --> 07:10.000
The concept of doing something for the last time feels eerie, like something that you should only experience when you're on death row, or extremely old, or something like that.

07:10.000 --> 07:12.000
But it happens all the time.

07:12.000 --> 07:16.000
Is there a hobby you've been lazy about for a long time?

07:16.000 --> 07:20.000
Maybe you still have those Warhammer minis that you wanted to paint.

07:20.000 --> 07:24.000
Did you always want to revisit that place where you had an amazing time a decade ago?

07:24.000 --> 07:29.000
Is there someone you wanted to reach out to for a long time, but haven't yet?

07:29.000 --> 07:32.000
Or pick up that sport again to meet new friends?

07:32.000 --> 07:40.000
Maybe you will never do any of these things again, because life gets in the way, and at some point, it's too late.

07:40.000 --> 07:47.000
As the global pandemic begins to wind down, we will all soon be able to be with each other again and do fun things together.

07:47.000 --> 07:54.000
It's never a bad time to reach out to a friend or a potential friend and let them know that you're looking forward to hanging out.

07:54.000 --> 08:03.000
But no matter when you're watching this, our life is an incredible gift, and there are so many fun, engaging, and fulfilling things to do.

08:03.000 --> 08:07.000
And you get to decide what and who matters to you.

08:07.000 --> 08:13.000
But what matters the most is that you actually make decisions from time to time.

08:14.000 --> 08:24.000
This video was based on and inspired by an article by our friend Tim Urban of WaitButWhy, the best blog on the internet.

08:24.000 --> 08:28.000
Be sure to check it out to get more new perspectives on things.

08:28.000 --> 08:33.000
Also, if you want a reminder about the things we still want to do in life, with Tim's permission,

08:33.000 --> 08:42.000
we created a Kurzgesagt version of the Calendar of Your Life that lets you track how many weeks of your life you've spent already and how many you have left.

08:42.000 --> 08:47.000
You can also color in the weeks to keep track of exactly how you're spending them.

08:47.000 --> 08:53.000
If you're just looking for a visual reminder to put things in perspective, we've made a timeline of your life.

08:53.000 --> 09:00.000
It's printed in vibrant neon colors on high-quality paper and will look great as an art piece on your wall.

09:00.000 --> 09:07.000
Like all of our products, these posters were designed with love and produced with care by us here at Kurzgesagt.

09:07.000 --> 09:13.000
Getting something from our shop is the best way to support our channel while getting something beautiful in return.

09:13.000 --> 09:20.000
Because of you, we can keep making elaborate videos like the one you just watched and release them for free for everyone.

09:20.000 --> 09:23.000
Thank you so much for your support.
