1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,400
Humans are proud of a lot of things, from particle accelerators, to poetry, to Pokemon.

2
00:00:06,400 --> 00:00:11,800
All of them made possible because of something humans value extremely highly, intelligence.

3
00:00:11,800 --> 00:00:18,800
We think of intelligence as a trait, like height or strength, but when we try to define it, things get fuzzy.

4
00:00:18,800 --> 00:00:25,000
In a nutshell, intelligence is a mechanism to solve problems, especially the problem of staying alive,

5
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:31,000
which involves finding food and shelter, fighting sexual competitors, or fleeing from predators.

6
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:41,000
Intelligence is not a single thing, it includes the ability to gather knowledge, to learn, be creative, form strategies, or engage in critical thinking.

7
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:52,000
It manifests itself in a huge variety of behaviors, from hardwired or instinct-like reactions, to different degrees of learning, to some sort of awareness.

8
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:58,000
But not all scientists agree where it begins, or what even should count as intelligence.

9
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:06,000
To make this even more complicated, intelligence is also connected to consciousness, since awareness is helpful for problem-solving.

10
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:11,000
But we're exploring consciousness in other videos, so today, we'll leave it aside.

11
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:21,000
Okay, intelligence isn't exactly clear-cut, so maybe we can think of it as more like a flexible set of skills, a toolbox.

12
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:30,000
The most basic tools in the intelligence toolbox are the ability to gather information, to save it, and to use it to learn.

13
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:42,000
Information about the world is gathered through senses such as vision, sound, smell, touch or taste, and helps us navigate and react to the external world appropriately.

14
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:49,000
But living things also need to keep track of the state of their own bodies, monitoring things like hunger and fatigue.

15
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:59,000
Information is the basis of action for all living things, and without it, you're at the mercy of your surroundings, unable to react appropriately or flexibly.

16
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:06,000
Information is much more powerful if we can keep and save it, so the second tool is memory.

17
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:15,000
Memory is the ability to save and recall information, so a living being doesn't have to start from scratch every time it perceives something relevant.

18
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:23,000
Memories can be about events, places, and associations, but also behaviors like hunting or foraging methods.

19
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:28,000
Some of these, like flying, have to be repeated over and over until they're mastered.

20
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:39,000
This is what we call learning, the process of putting together a sequence of thoughts or actions, basically a string of repeatable behaviors that can be varied and adapted.

21
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:46,000
These three tools enable seemingly stupid creatures to act in surprisingly intelligent ways.

22
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:55,000
The acellular slime mold, which is basically just a single huge slimy cell, shows behavior similar to an animal with a simple brain.

23
00:02:55,000 --> 00:03:05,000
When put in a maze with food at one end, the slime mold explores its surroundings and marks its path with slime trails, sort of smearing memories on the ground.

24
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:11,000
As it continues exploring, it avoids the marked pathways and finds its way to the food.

25
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:17,000
Instead of blindly getting stuck in dead ends, the slime mold adapts its behavior to save time and effort.

26
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:26,000
This behavior is hard-wired, and scientists can't agree if that's intelligent, although it does give the slime mold a certain advantage.

27
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:30,000
These are an example of more adaptive smart behavior.

28
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:35,000
Scientists trained bumblebees to move a colored ball into a goalpost for a sugar reward.

29
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:41,000
Not only were the bees very skillful at this behavior, which isn't natural to them, they got more efficient over time.

30
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:49,000
When several balls were available, bees chose the ball that lay closest to the goal, even if it was a different color than the ball they were trained with.

31
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:55,000
For more challenging problems, we need even more flexibility.

32
00:03:56,000 --> 00:04:04,000
Fancier tools. Building on the basic tools, more complex animals have a wider range of problems they can solve.

33
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:12,000
They can memorize all kinds of associations, connections, and mechanical tricks. We'll call this tool the library of knowledge.

34
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:16,000
Take raccoons. Their favorite kind of food is human food.

35
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:27,000
Their approach to getting hold of such treats depends upon an assortment of theoretical and practical skills that makes them master burglars, able to open windows or pick locks.

36
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:34,000
In a study, raccoons were given boxes secured with different kinds of locks, like latches, bolts, plugs, or push bars.

37
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:38,000
They needed less than ten attempts to figure out how to open each box.

38
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:47,000
Even when different locks were put together into increasingly difficult combinations that had to be solved in the right order and with different amounts of strength.

39
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:54,000
A year later, the raccoons still remembered how to open the boxes and were as fast as when they had first solved the puzzle.

40
00:04:55,000 --> 00:05:04,000
Beyond our library of associations and skills, the most impressive tool in our box is creativity, a sort of mental ducts tape.

41
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:11,000
Being creative means producing something new and valuable from apparently unrelated things.

42
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:22,000
In the context of intelligence, this means making new and unusual connections, pairing input with memories and skills to come up with a unique solution to a problem.

43
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:32,000
In another raccoon study, researchers showed the animals that by dropping pebbles into a water tank, they could raise the water level enough to reach a marshmallow floating at the top.

44
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:36,000
One raccoon came up with a much better solution. It tipped the tub over.

45
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:42,000
Another facet of creativity is applying a new resource to a task, physical tools.

46
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:54,000
Like primates that use sticks to fish for termites in trees, or some octopuses which assemble collected coconut shells around themselves as a sort of portable armor to hide from enemies.

47
00:05:54,000 --> 00:06:01,000
Collecting materials for later use is connected to an even more advanced dimension of problem solving, planning.

48
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:07,000
Planning means considering the activities required for a desired goal and putting them together in a plan.

49
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:15,000
When unforeseen circumstances and new possibilities present themselves, they need to be assessed according to whether they match the plan or not.

50
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:20,000
An example of this intelligent behavior is hoarding food to eat it later.

51
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:30,000
This is an instinctive behavior in squirrels, but even though hiding food comes instinctively to them, they still need to use advanced thinking skills to make the best decisions.

52
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:37,000
Squirrels examine every nut and weigh the time and effort it would take to hide it against the benefits they would get from each one.

53
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:44,000
Damaged or low-fat nuts are eaten right away, while nuts that still need to ripen go on the stockpile.

54
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:48,000
Squirrels also pretend to bury nuts when they feel watched.

55
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:53,000
These empty caches distract rivals from their real treasure.

56
00:06:53,000 --> 00:07:02,000
This is pretty advanced strategizing because to make a plan to distract someone else, you first have to be aware that there are others like you that want the same things.

57
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:07,000
The more complex the problem, the more tools are needed in combination to solve it.

58
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:13,000
So the more tools there are, the more flexibility a being has to solve the challenges life throws at them.

59
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:19,000
But even for complex problems, each animal's individual situation is what counts.

60
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:23,000
Squirrels are omnivores that defend their territories fiercely.

61
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:31,000
For them, it makes sense to remember where there's food in different locations and trick their enemies to improve their chances of survival.

62
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:36,000
Sheep don't have any such refined tricks up their sleeve, but they don't need to.

63
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:39,000
They are grazers and live in flocks.

64
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:41,000
The skills relevant to them are social.

65
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:46,000
They recognize and remember many different sheep and even humans for years.

66
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:48,000
A completely different skill.

67
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:55,000
Evolving and retaining a complex set of mental abilities they might never use would be a waste of resources for them.

68
00:07:55,000 --> 00:08:01,000
Humans went the opposite way and invested in an unusually diverse intelligence toolkit.

69
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:07,000
While this was helpful, by accident we added another set of tools on top, culture.

70
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:12,000
No single person could ever build a space rocket or particle accelerator.

71
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:21,000
But thanks to our ability to work together and to share knowledge across generations, we can overcome challenges beyond any single individual's ability.

72
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:24,000
This allowed us to shape the planet to our liking.

73
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:34,000
We also created new problems in the process, Sudoku, tax forms, string theory, but also rapid climate change and antibiotic resistance.

74
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:40,000
To solve these, we'll need to look past short-term survival and think about the distant future.

75
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:44,000
We have the toolbox. We just need to use it.

76
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:52,000
Speaking of tools for learning, we've heard from many teachers that are using our infographic posters in class.

77
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:59,000
So we asked what would help them the most and made an education edition for teachers, students, and everyone else.

78
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:08,000
They're slightly larger posters about various things that will expand over time, from a periodic table to a world map or the human body.

79
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:11,000
You can get them in our shop and support us if you want.

80
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:16,000
And let us know which poster topics you want for your room or classroom.

81
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:22,000
This video was part two of a three-part video series relating to big questions of life and the universe,

82
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:26,000
made possible thanks to a grant from the Templeton World Charity Foundation.

83
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:30,000
You'll find our sources and further reading in the video description.
