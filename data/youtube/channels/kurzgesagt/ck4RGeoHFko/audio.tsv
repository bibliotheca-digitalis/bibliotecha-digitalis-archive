0	6400	Humans are proud of a lot of things, from particle accelerators, to poetry, to Pokemon.
6400	11800	All of them made possible because of something humans value extremely highly, intelligence.
11800	18800	We think of intelligence as a trait, like height or strength, but when we try to define it, things get fuzzy.
18800	25000	In a nutshell, intelligence is a mechanism to solve problems, especially the problem of staying alive,
25000	31000	which involves finding food and shelter, fighting sexual competitors, or fleeing from predators.
31000	41000	Intelligence is not a single thing, it includes the ability to gather knowledge, to learn, be creative, form strategies, or engage in critical thinking.
41000	52000	It manifests itself in a huge variety of behaviors, from hardwired or instinct-like reactions, to different degrees of learning, to some sort of awareness.
53000	58000	But not all scientists agree where it begins, or what even should count as intelligence.
58000	66000	To make this even more complicated, intelligence is also connected to consciousness, since awareness is helpful for problem-solving.
66000	71000	But we're exploring consciousness in other videos, so today, we'll leave it aside.
71000	81000	Okay, intelligence isn't exactly clear-cut, so maybe we can think of it as more like a flexible set of skills, a toolbox.
82000	90000	The most basic tools in the intelligence toolbox are the ability to gather information, to save it, and to use it to learn.
90000	102000	Information about the world is gathered through senses such as vision, sound, smell, touch or taste, and helps us navigate and react to the external world appropriately.
102000	109000	But living things also need to keep track of the state of their own bodies, monitoring things like hunger and fatigue.
109000	119000	Information is the basis of action for all living things, and without it, you're at the mercy of your surroundings, unable to react appropriately or flexibly.
119000	126000	Information is much more powerful if we can keep and save it, so the second tool is memory.
126000	135000	Memory is the ability to save and recall information, so a living being doesn't have to start from scratch every time it perceives something relevant.
135000	143000	Memories can be about events, places, and associations, but also behaviors like hunting or foraging methods.
143000	148000	Some of these, like flying, have to be repeated over and over until they're mastered.
148000	159000	This is what we call learning, the process of putting together a sequence of thoughts or actions, basically a string of repeatable behaviors that can be varied and adapted.
159000	166000	These three tools enable seemingly stupid creatures to act in surprisingly intelligent ways.
166000	175000	The acellular slime mold, which is basically just a single huge slimy cell, shows behavior similar to an animal with a simple brain.
175000	185000	When put in a maze with food at one end, the slime mold explores its surroundings and marks its path with slime trails, sort of smearing memories on the ground.
185000	191000	As it continues exploring, it avoids the marked pathways and finds its way to the food.
191000	197000	Instead of blindly getting stuck in dead ends, the slime mold adapts its behavior to save time and effort.
197000	206000	This behavior is hard-wired, and scientists can't agree if that's intelligent, although it does give the slime mold a certain advantage.
206000	210000	These are an example of more adaptive smart behavior.
210000	215000	Scientists trained bumblebees to move a colored ball into a goalpost for a sugar reward.
215000	221000	Not only were the bees very skillful at this behavior, which isn't natural to them, they got more efficient over time.
221000	229000	When several balls were available, bees chose the ball that lay closest to the goal, even if it was a different color than the ball they were trained with.
231000	235000	For more challenging problems, we need even more flexibility.
236000	244000	Fancier tools. Building on the basic tools, more complex animals have a wider range of problems they can solve.
244000	252000	They can memorize all kinds of associations, connections, and mechanical tricks. We'll call this tool the library of knowledge.
252000	256000	Take raccoons. Their favorite kind of food is human food.
256000	267000	Their approach to getting hold of such treats depends upon an assortment of theoretical and practical skills that makes them master burglars, able to open windows or pick locks.
267000	274000	In a study, raccoons were given boxes secured with different kinds of locks, like latches, bolts, plugs, or push bars.
274000	278000	They needed less than ten attempts to figure out how to open each box.
278000	287000	Even when different locks were put together into increasingly difficult combinations that had to be solved in the right order and with different amounts of strength.
287000	294000	A year later, the raccoons still remembered how to open the boxes and were as fast as when they had first solved the puzzle.
295000	304000	Beyond our library of associations and skills, the most impressive tool in our box is creativity, a sort of mental ducts tape.
304000	311000	Being creative means producing something new and valuable from apparently unrelated things.
311000	322000	In the context of intelligence, this means making new and unusual connections, pairing input with memories and skills to come up with a unique solution to a problem.
322000	332000	In another raccoon study, researchers showed the animals that by dropping pebbles into a water tank, they could raise the water level enough to reach a marshmallow floating at the top.
332000	336000	One raccoon came up with a much better solution. It tipped the tub over.
336000	342000	Another facet of creativity is applying a new resource to a task, physical tools.
342000	354000	Like primates that use sticks to fish for termites in trees, or some octopuses which assemble collected coconut shells around themselves as a sort of portable armor to hide from enemies.
354000	361000	Collecting materials for later use is connected to an even more advanced dimension of problem solving, planning.
361000	367000	Planning means considering the activities required for a desired goal and putting them together in a plan.
367000	375000	When unforeseen circumstances and new possibilities present themselves, they need to be assessed according to whether they match the plan or not.
375000	380000	An example of this intelligent behavior is hoarding food to eat it later.
380000	390000	This is an instinctive behavior in squirrels, but even though hiding food comes instinctively to them, they still need to use advanced thinking skills to make the best decisions.
390000	397000	Squirrels examine every nut and weigh the time and effort it would take to hide it against the benefits they would get from each one.
397000	404000	Damaged or low-fat nuts are eaten right away, while nuts that still need to ripen go on the stockpile.
404000	408000	Squirrels also pretend to bury nuts when they feel watched.
408000	413000	These empty caches distract rivals from their real treasure.
413000	422000	This is pretty advanced strategizing because to make a plan to distract someone else, you first have to be aware that there are others like you that want the same things.
422000	427000	The more complex the problem, the more tools are needed in combination to solve it.
427000	433000	So the more tools there are, the more flexibility a being has to solve the challenges life throws at them.
433000	439000	But even for complex problems, each animal's individual situation is what counts.
439000	443000	Squirrels are omnivores that defend their territories fiercely.
443000	451000	For them, it makes sense to remember where there's food in different locations and trick their enemies to improve their chances of survival.
451000	456000	Sheep don't have any such refined tricks up their sleeve, but they don't need to.
456000	459000	They are grazers and live in flocks.
459000	461000	The skills relevant to them are social.
461000	466000	They recognize and remember many different sheep and even humans for years.
466000	468000	A completely different skill.
468000	475000	Evolving and retaining a complex set of mental abilities they might never use would be a waste of resources for them.
475000	481000	Humans went the opposite way and invested in an unusually diverse intelligence toolkit.
481000	487000	While this was helpful, by accident we added another set of tools on top, culture.
487000	492000	No single person could ever build a space rocket or particle accelerator.
492000	501000	But thanks to our ability to work together and to share knowledge across generations, we can overcome challenges beyond any single individual's ability.
501000	504000	This allowed us to shape the planet to our liking.
504000	514000	We also created new problems in the process, Sudoku, tax forms, string theory, but also rapid climate change and antibiotic resistance.
514000	520000	To solve these, we'll need to look past short-term survival and think about the distant future.
520000	524000	We have the toolbox. We just need to use it.
526000	532000	Speaking of tools for learning, we've heard from many teachers that are using our infographic posters in class.
532000	539000	So we asked what would help them the most and made an education edition for teachers, students, and everyone else.
539000	548000	They're slightly larger posters about various things that will expand over time, from a periodic table to a world map or the human body.
548000	551000	You can get them in our shop and support us if you want.
551000	556000	And let us know which poster topics you want for your room or classroom.
556000	562000	This video was part two of a three-part video series relating to big questions of life and the universe,
562000	566000	made possible thanks to a grant from the Templeton World Charity Foundation.
