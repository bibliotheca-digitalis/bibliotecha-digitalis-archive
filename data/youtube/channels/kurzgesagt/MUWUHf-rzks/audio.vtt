00:00.000 --> 00:05.960
Let's shrink an elephant to the size of a mouse and enlarge a mouse and make it the

00:05.960 --> 00:09.840
size of an elephant, because this is our video and we want to see what happens.

00:09.840 --> 00:14.740
First, our now tiny elephant stumbles around and then drops dead.

00:14.740 --> 00:18.480
Tiny elephant buddy is very cold, frozen to death in minutes.

00:18.480 --> 00:23.100
Our giant mouse looks very uncomfortable for a moment, and then it explodes, leaving hot

00:23.100 --> 00:25.360
mouse insides everywhere.

00:25.360 --> 00:26.840
Why?

00:26.840 --> 00:28.060
Because of size.

00:28.060 --> 00:32.360
We are optimized to function precisely for the size we are, and would die horribly in

00:32.360 --> 00:33.620
any other environment.

00:33.620 --> 00:35.840
But why exactly?

00:35.840 --> 00:51.300
Why does our mouse explode, and can we do this to our elephant too if we try hard?

00:51.300 --> 00:53.780
Life on this planet is based on cells.

00:53.780 --> 00:58.180
Cells do vary in size, but they're pretty similar in their dimensions across all species.

00:58.180 --> 01:03.740
A blue whale doesn't have bigger cells than a hummingbird, just a lot more of them.

01:03.740 --> 01:08.420
Cells have to do a lot of stuff to stay alive, and they need energy to be able to do so.

01:08.420 --> 01:14.680
To get this energy, animal cells convert food and oxygen into usable chemical energy.

01:14.680 --> 01:18.880
This happens in our mitochondria, the powerhouse of the cell.

01:18.880 --> 01:23.000
They're like little coal engines that spit out tiny ATP batteries, which the cell can

01:23.000 --> 01:26.040
use for almost everything it needs to do.

01:26.040 --> 01:30.000
Just like an engine, mitochondria get really hot while working.

01:30.000 --> 01:34.220
In human skin cells, they reach a scorching 50 degrees Celsius.

01:34.220 --> 01:39.880
And some of our cells have up to 2,000 mitochondria which are radiating their heat into the cell.

01:39.880 --> 01:43.000
So being alive generates a lot of heat.

01:43.000 --> 01:46.840
The more cells you have, the more heat your body generates in total.

01:46.840 --> 01:51.480
If our bodies didn't find ways of losing this heat, we would be cooked from the inside and

01:51.480 --> 01:53.040
die.

01:53.040 --> 01:57.120
But this is a problem for bigger animals because of the way bodies change as living beings

01:57.120 --> 01:59.000
scale up.

01:59.000 --> 02:01.840
Animals have three properties here that are important.

02:01.840 --> 02:07.100
Their length, their outsides or skin, and their insides like organs, bones, and hopes

02:07.100 --> 02:08.560
and dreams.

02:08.560 --> 02:12.560
The thing that's hard to wrap your head around is that when things grow, their insides grow

02:12.560 --> 02:15.320
faster than their outsides.

02:15.320 --> 02:17.200
Imagine a fleshy cube.

02:17.200 --> 02:21.760
If you double the length of its sides, its surface and volume do not double.

02:21.760 --> 02:26.240
In fact, the surface is now four times the original size and the volume of the cube eight

02:26.240 --> 02:31.760
times the original size, which is called the square cube law and has been annoying nature

02:31.760 --> 02:34.100
for billions of years.

02:34.100 --> 02:37.120
So why is this a problem for big animals?

02:37.120 --> 02:40.560
Because heat can only leave an object via its surface.

02:40.560 --> 02:46.760
So if we make our mouse the size of an elephant or 60 times longer, it has 3,600 times more

02:46.760 --> 02:53.200
surface from which to lose heat, but it has 216,000 times more volume filled with trillions

02:53.200 --> 02:57.760
and trillions of new hot mitochondria that produce more heat.

02:57.760 --> 03:01.380
A lot more insides, not that much more skin.

03:01.380 --> 03:05.200
Our mouse is very dead very fast.

03:05.200 --> 03:07.800
But big things like elephants exist.

03:07.800 --> 03:10.440
So how do they deal with the heat?

03:10.440 --> 03:14.880
For one, they evolved ways to get rid of energy more easily, like huge flat ears that have

03:14.880 --> 03:18.160
a lot of surface where heat can escape.

03:18.160 --> 03:19.620
But that's not enough.

03:19.620 --> 03:22.860
Nature's solution is actually very elegant.

03:22.860 --> 03:26.680
Elephant cells are much, much slower than mice cells.

03:26.680 --> 03:30.440
The bigger an animal is, the less active its cells are.

03:30.440 --> 03:34.880
If we classify animals by their metabolic rates and compare that to their overall mass,

03:34.880 --> 03:36.760
it's clearly visible.

03:36.760 --> 03:41.260
It's not 100% accurate, but it is a good rule of thumb.

03:41.260 --> 03:45.920
Elephants are huge meat sacks filled with trillions and trillions of little coal ovens.

03:45.920 --> 03:51.260
So they keep the ovens just active enough to keep them running and never at full power.

03:51.260 --> 03:53.440
Their whole metabolism is slow.

03:53.440 --> 03:56.500
Things move at a nice, chill pace.

03:56.500 --> 03:59.160
Small animals need to go the exact opposite way.

03:59.160 --> 04:03.860
If you're small, you have a lot of surface area compared to not a lot of volume.

04:03.860 --> 04:08.860
You don't have a lot of cell ovens and lose the heat they produce very fast.

04:08.860 --> 04:13.020
So very tiny mammals came up with a very extreme solution.

04:13.020 --> 04:18.220
Meet the Etruscan Shrew, the smallest mammal on Earth, a mole-like thing that's more closely

04:18.220 --> 04:20.740
related to hedgehogs than to mice.

04:20.740 --> 04:26.680
With a body length of 4 centimeters, it only weighs about 1.8 grams, as much as a paperclip.

04:26.680 --> 04:29.100
It's a tiny, ridiculous being.

04:29.100 --> 04:34.140
It would basically cool off immediately, so its cells run on overdrive to stay warm.

04:34.140 --> 04:37.420
Its tiny ovens are filled at maximum capacity.

04:37.420 --> 04:42.960
Its heart beats up to 1,200 times a minute, and it breathes up to 800 times a minute.

04:42.960 --> 04:47.760
This creates an extreme need for energy, so the shrew has to eat constantly.

04:47.760 --> 04:51.660
After only four hours without food, it starves to death.

04:51.660 --> 04:56.100
And while an African elephant consumes around 4% of its body weight in food each day, our

04:56.100 --> 05:00.900
shrew needs 200% of its body weight in food a day just to survive.

05:00.900 --> 05:05.100
Imagine having to eat 2,000 Big Macs a day, more than one a minute.

05:05.100 --> 05:08.060
One for a while, but then not so much.

05:08.060 --> 05:13.660
So a cubic centimeter of shrew needs 40 times more food than a cubic centimeter of elephant.

05:13.660 --> 05:18.500
If an elephant's cells suddenly become as active as the cells of a shrew, a crazy amount

05:18.500 --> 05:20.460
of heat would be generated.

05:20.460 --> 05:24.660
All the liquids in the elephant would suddenly start boiling, and then it would explode in

05:24.660 --> 05:29.060
an impressive explosion of steaming hot, burning elephant parts.

05:29.060 --> 05:33.540
In reality, before an explosion occurred, the proteins making up our cells would probably

05:33.540 --> 05:36.480
be denatured and stop producing heat.

05:36.480 --> 05:41.060
But a meat explosion is much more fun than melting an elephant into a massive hot goo.

05:41.060 --> 05:46.540
Regardless, the scaling of the speed of metabolism happens everywhere, even in places we don't

05:46.540 --> 05:48.860
expect, like pregnant women.

05:48.860 --> 05:52.740
A baby in the womb of its mother behaves as if it were a part of her.

05:52.740 --> 05:58.180
Its cells have about the same metabolic rate, the same speed of life as its mother's organs.

05:58.180 --> 06:02.220
It is truly a part of a bigger whole rather than an individual.

06:02.220 --> 06:04.340
Until it's not anymore.

06:04.340 --> 06:09.180
The very moment a baby is born, a switch is flipped and all its internal processes speed

06:09.180 --> 06:10.620
up rapidly.

06:10.620 --> 06:17.900
36 hours after birth, the baby's cells have the same activity rate as a mammal its size.

06:17.900 --> 06:23.180
Babies literally transition from being an organ to being an individual in mere hours.

06:23.180 --> 06:28.300
But there's one thing where big and small things are very similar, heartbeats.

06:28.300 --> 06:32.140
Elephants tend to have a similar amount of heartbeats over their lifetime, typically

06:32.140 --> 06:34.540
around 1 billion.

06:34.540 --> 06:39.300
So while the shrew and elephant are very different, they share a similar number of heartbeats

06:39.300 --> 06:41.780
over the course of their lives.

06:41.780 --> 06:46.500
Their speed of life is the opposite and somehow still the same.

06:46.500 --> 06:51.240
And for a video in which we made elephants explode for no good reason, this is the most

06:51.240 --> 06:53.220
romantic ending we could come up with.
