1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,960
Let's shrink an elephant to the size of a mouse and enlarge a mouse and make it the

2
00:00:05,960 --> 00:00:09,840
size of an elephant, because this is our video and we want to see what happens.

3
00:00:09,840 --> 00:00:14,740
First, our now tiny elephant stumbles around and then drops dead.

4
00:00:14,740 --> 00:00:18,480
Tiny elephant buddy is very cold, frozen to death in minutes.

5
00:00:18,480 --> 00:00:23,100
Our giant mouse looks very uncomfortable for a moment, and then it explodes, leaving hot

6
00:00:23,100 --> 00:00:25,360
mouse insides everywhere.

7
00:00:25,360 --> 00:00:26,840
Why?

8
00:00:26,840 --> 00:00:28,060
Because of size.

9
00:00:28,060 --> 00:00:32,360
We are optimized to function precisely for the size we are, and would die horribly in

10
00:00:32,360 --> 00:00:33,620
any other environment.

11
00:00:33,620 --> 00:00:35,840
But why exactly?

12
00:00:35,840 --> 00:00:51,300
Why does our mouse explode, and can we do this to our elephant too if we try hard?

13
00:00:51,300 --> 00:00:53,780
Life on this planet is based on cells.

14
00:00:53,780 --> 00:00:58,180
Cells do vary in size, but they're pretty similar in their dimensions across all species.

15
00:00:58,180 --> 00:01:03,740
A blue whale doesn't have bigger cells than a hummingbird, just a lot more of them.

16
00:01:03,740 --> 00:01:08,420
Cells have to do a lot of stuff to stay alive, and they need energy to be able to do so.

17
00:01:08,420 --> 00:01:14,680
To get this energy, animal cells convert food and oxygen into usable chemical energy.

18
00:01:14,680 --> 00:01:18,880
This happens in our mitochondria, the powerhouse of the cell.

19
00:01:18,880 --> 00:01:23,000
They're like little coal engines that spit out tiny ATP batteries, which the cell can

20
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:26,040
use for almost everything it needs to do.

21
00:01:26,040 --> 00:01:30,000
Just like an engine, mitochondria get really hot while working.

22
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:34,220
In human skin cells, they reach a scorching 50 degrees Celsius.

23
00:01:34,220 --> 00:01:39,880
And some of our cells have up to 2,000 mitochondria which are radiating their heat into the cell.

24
00:01:39,880 --> 00:01:43,000
So being alive generates a lot of heat.

25
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:46,840
The more cells you have, the more heat your body generates in total.

26
00:01:46,840 --> 00:01:51,480
If our bodies didn't find ways of losing this heat, we would be cooked from the inside and

27
00:01:51,480 --> 00:01:53,040
die.

28
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:57,120
But this is a problem for bigger animals because of the way bodies change as living beings

29
00:01:57,120 --> 00:01:59,000
scale up.

30
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:01,840
Animals have three properties here that are important.

31
00:02:01,840 --> 00:02:07,100
Their length, their outsides or skin, and their insides like organs, bones, and hopes

32
00:02:07,100 --> 00:02:08,560
and dreams.

33
00:02:08,560 --> 00:02:12,560
The thing that's hard to wrap your head around is that when things grow, their insides grow

34
00:02:12,560 --> 00:02:15,320
faster than their outsides.

35
00:02:15,320 --> 00:02:17,200
Imagine a fleshy cube.

36
00:02:17,200 --> 00:02:21,760
If you double the length of its sides, its surface and volume do not double.

37
00:02:21,760 --> 00:02:26,240
In fact, the surface is now four times the original size and the volume of the cube eight

38
00:02:26,240 --> 00:02:31,760
times the original size, which is called the square cube law and has been annoying nature

39
00:02:31,760 --> 00:02:34,100
for billions of years.

40
00:02:34,100 --> 00:02:37,120
So why is this a problem for big animals?

41
00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:40,560
Because heat can only leave an object via its surface.

42
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:46,760
So if we make our mouse the size of an elephant or 60 times longer, it has 3,600 times more

43
00:02:46,760 --> 00:02:53,200
surface from which to lose heat, but it has 216,000 times more volume filled with trillions

44
00:02:53,200 --> 00:02:57,760
and trillions of new hot mitochondria that produce more heat.

45
00:02:57,760 --> 00:03:01,380
A lot more insides, not that much more skin.

46
00:03:01,380 --> 00:03:05,200
Our mouse is very dead very fast.

47
00:03:05,200 --> 00:03:07,800
But big things like elephants exist.

48
00:03:07,800 --> 00:03:10,440
So how do they deal with the heat?

49
00:03:10,440 --> 00:03:14,880
For one, they evolved ways to get rid of energy more easily, like huge flat ears that have

50
00:03:14,880 --> 00:03:18,160
a lot of surface where heat can escape.

51
00:03:18,160 --> 00:03:19,620
But that's not enough.

52
00:03:19,620 --> 00:03:22,860
Nature's solution is actually very elegant.

53
00:03:22,860 --> 00:03:26,680
Elephant cells are much, much slower than mice cells.

54
00:03:26,680 --> 00:03:30,440
The bigger an animal is, the less active its cells are.

55
00:03:30,440 --> 00:03:34,880
If we classify animals by their metabolic rates and compare that to their overall mass,

56
00:03:34,880 --> 00:03:36,760
it's clearly visible.

57
00:03:36,760 --> 00:03:41,260
It's not 100% accurate, but it is a good rule of thumb.

58
00:03:41,260 --> 00:03:45,920
Elephants are huge meat sacks filled with trillions and trillions of little coal ovens.

59
00:03:45,920 --> 00:03:51,260
So they keep the ovens just active enough to keep them running and never at full power.

60
00:03:51,260 --> 00:03:53,440
Their whole metabolism is slow.

61
00:03:53,440 --> 00:03:56,500
Things move at a nice, chill pace.

62
00:03:56,500 --> 00:03:59,160
Small animals need to go the exact opposite way.

63
00:03:59,160 --> 00:04:03,860
If you're small, you have a lot of surface area compared to not a lot of volume.

64
00:04:03,860 --> 00:04:08,860
You don't have a lot of cell ovens and lose the heat they produce very fast.

65
00:04:08,860 --> 00:04:13,020
So very tiny mammals came up with a very extreme solution.

66
00:04:13,020 --> 00:04:18,220
Meet the Etruscan Shrew, the smallest mammal on Earth, a mole-like thing that's more closely

67
00:04:18,220 --> 00:04:20,740
related to hedgehogs than to mice.

68
00:04:20,740 --> 00:04:26,680
With a body length of 4 centimeters, it only weighs about 1.8 grams, as much as a paperclip.

69
00:04:26,680 --> 00:04:29,100
It's a tiny, ridiculous being.

70
00:04:29,100 --> 00:04:34,140
It would basically cool off immediately, so its cells run on overdrive to stay warm.

71
00:04:34,140 --> 00:04:37,420
Its tiny ovens are filled at maximum capacity.

72
00:04:37,420 --> 00:04:42,960
Its heart beats up to 1,200 times a minute, and it breathes up to 800 times a minute.

73
00:04:42,960 --> 00:04:47,760
This creates an extreme need for energy, so the shrew has to eat constantly.

74
00:04:47,760 --> 00:04:51,660
After only four hours without food, it starves to death.

75
00:04:51,660 --> 00:04:56,100
And while an African elephant consumes around 4% of its body weight in food each day, our

76
00:04:56,100 --> 00:05:00,900
shrew needs 200% of its body weight in food a day just to survive.

77
00:05:00,900 --> 00:05:05,100
Imagine having to eat 2,000 Big Macs a day, more than one a minute.

78
00:05:05,100 --> 00:05:08,060
One for a while, but then not so much.

79
00:05:08,060 --> 00:05:13,660
So a cubic centimeter of shrew needs 40 times more food than a cubic centimeter of elephant.

80
00:05:13,660 --> 00:05:18,500
If an elephant's cells suddenly become as active as the cells of a shrew, a crazy amount

81
00:05:18,500 --> 00:05:20,460
of heat would be generated.

82
00:05:20,460 --> 00:05:24,660
All the liquids in the elephant would suddenly start boiling, and then it would explode in

83
00:05:24,660 --> 00:05:29,060
an impressive explosion of steaming hot, burning elephant parts.

84
00:05:29,060 --> 00:05:33,540
In reality, before an explosion occurred, the proteins making up our cells would probably

85
00:05:33,540 --> 00:05:36,480
be denatured and stop producing heat.

86
00:05:36,480 --> 00:05:41,060
But a meat explosion is much more fun than melting an elephant into a massive hot goo.

87
00:05:41,060 --> 00:05:46,540
Regardless, the scaling of the speed of metabolism happens everywhere, even in places we don't

88
00:05:46,540 --> 00:05:48,860
expect, like pregnant women.

89
00:05:48,860 --> 00:05:52,740
A baby in the womb of its mother behaves as if it were a part of her.

90
00:05:52,740 --> 00:05:58,180
Its cells have about the same metabolic rate, the same speed of life as its mother's organs.

91
00:05:58,180 --> 00:06:02,220
It is truly a part of a bigger whole rather than an individual.

92
00:06:02,220 --> 00:06:04,340
Until it's not anymore.

93
00:06:04,340 --> 00:06:09,180
The very moment a baby is born, a switch is flipped and all its internal processes speed

94
00:06:09,180 --> 00:06:10,620
up rapidly.

95
00:06:10,620 --> 00:06:17,900
36 hours after birth, the baby's cells have the same activity rate as a mammal its size.

96
00:06:17,900 --> 00:06:23,180
Babies literally transition from being an organ to being an individual in mere hours.

97
00:06:23,180 --> 00:06:28,300
But there's one thing where big and small things are very similar, heartbeats.

98
00:06:28,300 --> 00:06:32,140
Elephants tend to have a similar amount of heartbeats over their lifetime, typically

99
00:06:32,140 --> 00:06:34,540
around 1 billion.

100
00:06:34,540 --> 00:06:39,300
So while the shrew and elephant are very different, they share a similar number of heartbeats

101
00:06:39,300 --> 00:06:41,780
over the course of their lives.

102
00:06:41,780 --> 00:06:46,500
Their speed of life is the opposite and somehow still the same.

103
00:06:46,500 --> 00:06:51,240
And for a video in which we made elephants explode for no good reason, this is the most

104
00:06:51,240 --> 00:06:53,220
romantic ending we could come up with.
