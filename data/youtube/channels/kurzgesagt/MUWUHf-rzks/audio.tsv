0	5960	Let's shrink an elephant to the size of a mouse and enlarge a mouse and make it the
5960	9840	size of an elephant, because this is our video and we want to see what happens.
9840	14740	First, our now tiny elephant stumbles around and then drops dead.
14740	18480	Tiny elephant buddy is very cold, frozen to death in minutes.
18480	23100	Our giant mouse looks very uncomfortable for a moment, and then it explodes, leaving hot
23100	25360	mouse insides everywhere.
25360	26840	Why?
26840	28060	Because of size.
28060	32360	We are optimized to function precisely for the size we are, and would die horribly in
32360	33620	any other environment.
33620	35840	But why exactly?
35840	51300	Why does our mouse explode, and can we do this to our elephant too if we try hard?
51300	53780	Life on this planet is based on cells.
53780	58180	Cells do vary in size, but they're pretty similar in their dimensions across all species.
58180	63740	A blue whale doesn't have bigger cells than a hummingbird, just a lot more of them.
63740	68420	Cells have to do a lot of stuff to stay alive, and they need energy to be able to do so.
68420	74680	To get this energy, animal cells convert food and oxygen into usable chemical energy.
74680	78880	This happens in our mitochondria, the powerhouse of the cell.
78880	83000	They're like little coal engines that spit out tiny ATP batteries, which the cell can
83000	86040	use for almost everything it needs to do.
86040	90000	Just like an engine, mitochondria get really hot while working.
90000	94220	In human skin cells, they reach a scorching 50 degrees Celsius.
94220	99880	And some of our cells have up to 2,000 mitochondria which are radiating their heat into the cell.
99880	103000	So being alive generates a lot of heat.
103000	106840	The more cells you have, the more heat your body generates in total.
106840	111480	If our bodies didn't find ways of losing this heat, we would be cooked from the inside and
111480	113040	die.
113040	117120	But this is a problem for bigger animals because of the way bodies change as living beings
117120	119000	scale up.
119000	121840	Animals have three properties here that are important.
121840	127100	Their length, their outsides or skin, and their insides like organs, bones, and hopes
127100	128560	and dreams.
128560	132560	The thing that's hard to wrap your head around is that when things grow, their insides grow
132560	135320	faster than their outsides.
135320	137200	Imagine a fleshy cube.
137200	141760	If you double the length of its sides, its surface and volume do not double.
141760	146240	In fact, the surface is now four times the original size and the volume of the cube eight
146240	151760	times the original size, which is called the square cube law and has been annoying nature
151760	154100	for billions of years.
154100	157120	So why is this a problem for big animals?
157120	160560	Because heat can only leave an object via its surface.
160560	166760	So if we make our mouse the size of an elephant or 60 times longer, it has 3,600 times more
166760	173200	surface from which to lose heat, but it has 216,000 times more volume filled with trillions
173200	177760	and trillions of new hot mitochondria that produce more heat.
177760	181380	A lot more insides, not that much more skin.
181380	185200	Our mouse is very dead very fast.
185200	187800	But big things like elephants exist.
187800	190440	So how do they deal with the heat?
190440	194880	For one, they evolved ways to get rid of energy more easily, like huge flat ears that have
194880	198160	a lot of surface where heat can escape.
198160	199620	But that's not enough.
199620	202860	Nature's solution is actually very elegant.
202860	206680	Elephant cells are much, much slower than mice cells.
206680	210440	The bigger an animal is, the less active its cells are.
210440	214880	If we classify animals by their metabolic rates and compare that to their overall mass,
214880	216760	it's clearly visible.
216760	221260	It's not 100% accurate, but it is a good rule of thumb.
221260	225920	Elephants are huge meat sacks filled with trillions and trillions of little coal ovens.
225920	231260	So they keep the ovens just active enough to keep them running and never at full power.
231260	233440	Their whole metabolism is slow.
233440	236500	Things move at a nice, chill pace.
236500	239160	Small animals need to go the exact opposite way.
239160	243860	If you're small, you have a lot of surface area compared to not a lot of volume.
243860	248860	You don't have a lot of cell ovens and lose the heat they produce very fast.
248860	253020	So very tiny mammals came up with a very extreme solution.
253020	258220	Meet the Etruscan Shrew, the smallest mammal on Earth, a mole-like thing that's more closely
258220	260740	related to hedgehogs than to mice.
260740	266680	With a body length of 4 centimeters, it only weighs about 1.8 grams, as much as a paperclip.
266680	269100	It's a tiny, ridiculous being.
269100	274140	It would basically cool off immediately, so its cells run on overdrive to stay warm.
274140	277420	Its tiny ovens are filled at maximum capacity.
277420	282960	Its heart beats up to 1,200 times a minute, and it breathes up to 800 times a minute.
282960	287760	This creates an extreme need for energy, so the shrew has to eat constantly.
287760	291660	After only four hours without food, it starves to death.
291660	296100	And while an African elephant consumes around 4% of its body weight in food each day, our
296100	300900	shrew needs 200% of its body weight in food a day just to survive.
300900	305100	Imagine having to eat 2,000 Big Macs a day, more than one a minute.
305100	308060	One for a while, but then not so much.
308060	313660	So a cubic centimeter of shrew needs 40 times more food than a cubic centimeter of elephant.
313660	318500	If an elephant's cells suddenly become as active as the cells of a shrew, a crazy amount
318500	320460	of heat would be generated.
320460	324660	All the liquids in the elephant would suddenly start boiling, and then it would explode in
324660	329060	an impressive explosion of steaming hot, burning elephant parts.
329060	333540	In reality, before an explosion occurred, the proteins making up our cells would probably
333540	336480	be denatured and stop producing heat.
336480	341060	But a meat explosion is much more fun than melting an elephant into a massive hot goo.
341060	346540	Regardless, the scaling of the speed of metabolism happens everywhere, even in places we don't
346540	348860	expect, like pregnant women.
348860	352740	A baby in the womb of its mother behaves as if it were a part of her.
352740	358180	Its cells have about the same metabolic rate, the same speed of life as its mother's organs.
358180	362220	It is truly a part of a bigger whole rather than an individual.
362220	364340	Until it's not anymore.
364340	369180	The very moment a baby is born, a switch is flipped and all its internal processes speed
369180	370620	up rapidly.
370620	377900	36 hours after birth, the baby's cells have the same activity rate as a mammal its size.
377900	383180	Babies literally transition from being an organ to being an individual in mere hours.
383180	388300	But there's one thing where big and small things are very similar, heartbeats.
388300	392140	Elephants tend to have a similar amount of heartbeats over their lifetime, typically
392140	394540	around 1 billion.
394540	399300	So while the shrew and elephant are very different, they share a similar number of heartbeats
399300	401780	over the course of their lives.
401780	406500	Their speed of life is the opposite and somehow still the same.
406500	411240	And for a video in which we made elephants explode for no good reason, this is the most
411240	413220	romantic ending we could come up with.
