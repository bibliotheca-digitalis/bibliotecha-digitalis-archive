00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:13,540
The Ocean Conveyor Belt and the Gulf Stream

2
00:00:13,540 --> 00:00:16,980
Ocean currents have a direct influence on our lives.

3
00:00:16,980 --> 00:00:21,620
They determine our weather, our climate and much more.

4
00:00:21,620 --> 00:00:27,440
The ocean currents and wind systems transport heat from the equator to the poles and operate

5
00:00:27,440 --> 00:00:30,660
like a large engine for the global climate.

6
00:00:30,660 --> 00:00:33,760
In the oceans, there are numerous currents.

7
00:00:33,760 --> 00:00:38,620
The so-called ocean conveyor belt is very important for our climate.

8
00:00:38,620 --> 00:00:43,100
This term describes a combination of currents that result in four of the five global oceans

9
00:00:43,100 --> 00:00:45,520
exchanging water with each other.

10
00:00:45,520 --> 00:00:49,520
They form a worldwide circulation system.

11
00:00:49,520 --> 00:00:54,440
The conveyor belt is also called the thermohaline circulation, with thermo referring to the

12
00:00:54,440 --> 00:00:59,320
temperature and haline to the salt content of the water.

13
00:00:59,320 --> 00:01:02,560
Both determine the density of the water.

14
00:01:02,560 --> 00:01:07,200
While the masses of water may be moved in part by wind, primarily the different densities

15
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:11,000
of the global oceans are responsible for their movement.

16
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:16,640
Warm water has a lower density and rises, while cold water sinks.

17
00:01:16,640 --> 00:01:20,960
The water's density also increases with a higher salt content.

18
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:25,640
At the equator, the heat from the sun is especially strong, resulting in a lot of evaporation

19
00:01:25,640 --> 00:01:29,800
and thus a rise in the water's salt content.

20
00:01:29,800 --> 00:01:32,600
That is where the Gulf Stream begins.

21
00:01:32,600 --> 00:01:37,400
The Gulf Stream is very important for the European climate.

22
00:01:37,400 --> 00:01:42,600
Its length of 10,000 km makes it one of the largest and fastest ocean currents on Earth

23
00:01:42,600 --> 00:01:44,680
and it is very warm.

24
00:01:44,680 --> 00:01:50,180
At roughly 2 metres a second, it brings up to 100 million cubic metres of water per second

25
00:01:50,180 --> 00:01:53,500
towards Europe.

26
00:01:53,500 --> 00:01:58,060
A constantly blowing wind, the South East Trade Wind, drives warm surface water to the

27
00:01:58,060 --> 00:02:04,740
North West into the Gulf of Mexico, where it heats up to 30 degrees Celsius.

28
00:02:04,740 --> 00:02:09,060
The turning of the Earth and the West winds then direct the Gulf Stream towards Europe

29
00:02:09,060 --> 00:02:11,020
and split it up.

30
00:02:11,020 --> 00:02:17,260
One part flows south, another east to the Canary Current, and a third part flows north,

31
00:02:17,340 --> 00:02:22,940
where it releases a lot of heat into the atmosphere as the North Atlantic Current.

32
00:02:22,940 --> 00:02:25,100
The water becomes colder there.

33
00:02:25,100 --> 00:02:30,860
Its salt content and density rise on account of evaporation and it drops down between Greenland,

34
00:02:30,860 --> 00:02:33,620
Norway and Iceland.

35
00:02:33,620 --> 00:02:37,140
There we also find the largest waterfall on Earth.

36
00:02:37,140 --> 00:02:44,140
The so-called chimneys, roughly 15 km wide pillars with water falling up to 4,000 metres.

37
00:02:44,140 --> 00:02:50,220
17 million cubic metres of water per second, or roughly 15 times more water than is carried

38
00:02:50,220 --> 00:02:53,460
by all the rivers in the world.

39
00:02:53,460 --> 00:02:58,260
This creates a strong maelstrom which constantly pulls in new water and is the reason that

40
00:02:58,260 --> 00:03:00,740
the Gulf Stream moves towards Europe.

41
00:03:00,740 --> 00:03:04,540
Countless species use the Gulf Stream as a means of transport on their trips from the

42
00:03:04,540 --> 00:03:07,260
Caribbean to northern areas.

43
00:03:07,260 --> 00:03:09,140
But it doesn't just bring us animals.

44
00:03:09,140 --> 00:03:13,660
An enormous quantity of warm air also comes with it, in order to reduce the same heat

45
00:03:13,660 --> 00:03:18,940
which it brings to the shores of Europe, we would need 1 million nuclear power plants.

46
00:03:18,940 --> 00:03:21,900
That's why we also call the Gulf Stream a heat pump.

47
00:03:21,900 --> 00:03:26,900
Without it, the temperature would be significantly colder here, at least 5 to 10 degrees.

48
00:03:26,900 --> 00:03:32,340
Instead of lush fields, we would have long winters and sparse ice-covered landscapes in Europe.

49
00:03:32,340 --> 00:03:36,860
In the last few years, scientists and pundits in the media have repeatedly expressed the

50
00:03:36,860 --> 00:03:41,980
fear that the Gulf Stream could come to a standstill due to climate change.

51
00:03:41,980 --> 00:03:46,020
Because if the polar caps actually melt, the salt content in the water off Greenland

52
00:03:46,020 --> 00:03:49,180
would fall, as would its density.

53
00:03:49,180 --> 00:03:55,820
The North Atlantic current would no longer be heavy enough, and so it wouldn't sink as usual.

54
00:03:55,820 --> 00:04:01,860
In the worst case, that would bring the Gulf Stream, our heat pump, to a stop.

55
00:04:01,860 --> 00:04:07,860
Some climate experts also assume that climate change could compensate for this effect.

56
00:04:07,860 --> 00:04:11,860
We know that it can be normal for the climate to change by looking at the development of

57
00:04:11,860 --> 00:04:15,060
the Earth over the last few million years.

58
00:04:15,060 --> 00:04:18,500
There are ice ages and warm periods.

59
00:04:18,500 --> 00:04:23,620
In the last ice age, a gigantic flood of melting water crippled the heat-bringing North Atlantic

60
00:04:23,620 --> 00:04:28,780
current covering the northern hemisphere in ice.

61
00:04:28,780 --> 00:04:32,580
Scientists have different views on the impact that climate change will have on the global

62
00:04:32,580 --> 00:04:35,020
ocean conveyor belt.

63
00:04:35,020 --> 00:04:36,340
But one thing is clear.

64
00:04:36,340 --> 00:04:40,660
When the climate changes, then the complex system of ocean currents and winds, which

65
00:04:40,660 --> 00:04:46,300
has remained fairly stable since the last ice age, will change in ways that we don't yet understand.
