0	13540	The Ocean Conveyor Belt and the Gulf Stream
13540	16980	Ocean currents have a direct influence on our lives.
16980	21620	They determine our weather, our climate and much more.
21620	27440	The ocean currents and wind systems transport heat from the equator to the poles and operate
27440	30660	like a large engine for the global climate.
30660	33760	In the oceans, there are numerous currents.
33760	38620	The so-called ocean conveyor belt is very important for our climate.
38620	43100	This term describes a combination of currents that result in four of the five global oceans
43100	45520	exchanging water with each other.
45520	49520	They form a worldwide circulation system.
49520	54440	The conveyor belt is also called the thermohaline circulation, with thermo referring to the
54440	59320	temperature and haline to the salt content of the water.
59320	62560	Both determine the density of the water.
62560	67200	While the masses of water may be moved in part by wind, primarily the different densities
67200	71000	of the global oceans are responsible for their movement.
71000	76640	Warm water has a lower density and rises, while cold water sinks.
76640	80960	The water's density also increases with a higher salt content.
81000	85640	At the equator, the heat from the sun is especially strong, resulting in a lot of evaporation
85640	89800	and thus a rise in the water's salt content.
89800	92600	That is where the Gulf Stream begins.
92600	97400	The Gulf Stream is very important for the European climate.
97400	102600	Its length of 10,000 km makes it one of the largest and fastest ocean currents on Earth
102600	104680	and it is very warm.
104680	110180	At roughly 2 metres a second, it brings up to 100 million cubic metres of water per second
110180	113500	towards Europe.
113500	118060	A constantly blowing wind, the South East Trade Wind, drives warm surface water to the
118060	124740	North West into the Gulf of Mexico, where it heats up to 30 degrees Celsius.
124740	129060	The turning of the Earth and the West winds then direct the Gulf Stream towards Europe
129060	131020	and split it up.
131020	137260	One part flows south, another east to the Canary Current, and a third part flows north,
137340	142940	where it releases a lot of heat into the atmosphere as the North Atlantic Current.
142940	145100	The water becomes colder there.
145100	150860	Its salt content and density rise on account of evaporation and it drops down between Greenland,
150860	153620	Norway and Iceland.
153620	157140	There we also find the largest waterfall on Earth.
157140	164140	The so-called chimneys, roughly 15 km wide pillars with water falling up to 4,000 metres.
164140	170220	17 million cubic metres of water per second, or roughly 15 times more water than is carried
170220	173460	by all the rivers in the world.
173460	178260	This creates a strong maelstrom which constantly pulls in new water and is the reason that
178260	180740	the Gulf Stream moves towards Europe.
180740	184540	Countless species use the Gulf Stream as a means of transport on their trips from the
184540	187260	Caribbean to northern areas.
187260	189140	But it doesn't just bring us animals.
189140	193660	An enormous quantity of warm air also comes with it, in order to reduce the same heat
193660	198940	which it brings to the shores of Europe, we would need 1 million nuclear power plants.
198940	201900	That's why we also call the Gulf Stream a heat pump.
201900	206900	Without it, the temperature would be significantly colder here, at least 5 to 10 degrees.
206900	212340	Instead of lush fields, we would have long winters and sparse ice-covered landscapes in Europe.
212340	216860	In the last few years, scientists and pundits in the media have repeatedly expressed the
216860	221980	fear that the Gulf Stream could come to a standstill due to climate change.
221980	226020	Because if the polar caps actually melt, the salt content in the water off Greenland
226020	229180	would fall, as would its density.
229180	235820	The North Atlantic current would no longer be heavy enough, and so it wouldn't sink as usual.
235820	241860	In the worst case, that would bring the Gulf Stream, our heat pump, to a stop.
241860	247860	Some climate experts also assume that climate change could compensate for this effect.
247860	251860	We know that it can be normal for the climate to change by looking at the development of
251860	255060	the Earth over the last few million years.
255060	258500	There are ice ages and warm periods.
258500	263620	In the last ice age, a gigantic flood of melting water crippled the heat-bringing North Atlantic
263620	268780	current covering the northern hemisphere in ice.
268780	272580	Scientists have different views on the impact that climate change will have on the global
272580	275020	ocean conveyor belt.
275020	276340	But one thing is clear.
276340	280660	When the climate changes, then the complex system of ocean currents and winds, which
280660	286300	has remained fairly stable since the last ice age, will change in ways that we don't yet understand.
