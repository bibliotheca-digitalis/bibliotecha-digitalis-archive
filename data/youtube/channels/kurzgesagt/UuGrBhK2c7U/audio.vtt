00:00.000 --> 00:13.540
The Ocean Conveyor Belt and the Gulf Stream

00:13.540 --> 00:16.980
Ocean currents have a direct influence on our lives.

00:16.980 --> 00:21.620
They determine our weather, our climate and much more.

00:21.620 --> 00:27.440
The ocean currents and wind systems transport heat from the equator to the poles and operate

00:27.440 --> 00:30.660
like a large engine for the global climate.

00:30.660 --> 00:33.760
In the oceans, there are numerous currents.

00:33.760 --> 00:38.620
The so-called ocean conveyor belt is very important for our climate.

00:38.620 --> 00:43.100
This term describes a combination of currents that result in four of the five global oceans

00:43.100 --> 00:45.520
exchanging water with each other.

00:45.520 --> 00:49.520
They form a worldwide circulation system.

00:49.520 --> 00:54.440
The conveyor belt is also called the thermohaline circulation, with thermo referring to the

00:54.440 --> 00:59.320
temperature and haline to the salt content of the water.

00:59.320 --> 01:02.560
Both determine the density of the water.

01:02.560 --> 01:07.200
While the masses of water may be moved in part by wind, primarily the different densities

01:07.200 --> 01:11.000
of the global oceans are responsible for their movement.

01:11.000 --> 01:16.640
Warm water has a lower density and rises, while cold water sinks.

01:16.640 --> 01:20.960
The water's density also increases with a higher salt content.

01:21.000 --> 01:25.640
At the equator, the heat from the sun is especially strong, resulting in a lot of evaporation

01:25.640 --> 01:29.800
and thus a rise in the water's salt content.

01:29.800 --> 01:32.600
That is where the Gulf Stream begins.

01:32.600 --> 01:37.400
The Gulf Stream is very important for the European climate.

01:37.400 --> 01:42.600
Its length of 10,000 km makes it one of the largest and fastest ocean currents on Earth

01:42.600 --> 01:44.680
and it is very warm.

01:44.680 --> 01:50.180
At roughly 2 metres a second, it brings up to 100 million cubic metres of water per second

01:50.180 --> 01:53.500
towards Europe.

01:53.500 --> 01:58.060
A constantly blowing wind, the South East Trade Wind, drives warm surface water to the

01:58.060 --> 02:04.740
North West into the Gulf of Mexico, where it heats up to 30 degrees Celsius.

02:04.740 --> 02:09.060
The turning of the Earth and the West winds then direct the Gulf Stream towards Europe

02:09.060 --> 02:11.020
and split it up.

02:11.020 --> 02:17.260
One part flows south, another east to the Canary Current, and a third part flows north,

02:17.340 --> 02:22.940
where it releases a lot of heat into the atmosphere as the North Atlantic Current.

02:22.940 --> 02:25.100
The water becomes colder there.

02:25.100 --> 02:30.860
Its salt content and density rise on account of evaporation and it drops down between Greenland,

02:30.860 --> 02:33.620
Norway and Iceland.

02:33.620 --> 02:37.140
There we also find the largest waterfall on Earth.

02:37.140 --> 02:44.140
The so-called chimneys, roughly 15 km wide pillars with water falling up to 4,000 metres.

02:44.140 --> 02:50.220
17 million cubic metres of water per second, or roughly 15 times more water than is carried

02:50.220 --> 02:53.460
by all the rivers in the world.

02:53.460 --> 02:58.260
This creates a strong maelstrom which constantly pulls in new water and is the reason that

02:58.260 --> 03:00.740
the Gulf Stream moves towards Europe.

03:00.740 --> 03:04.540
Countless species use the Gulf Stream as a means of transport on their trips from the

03:04.540 --> 03:07.260
Caribbean to northern areas.

03:07.260 --> 03:09.140
But it doesn't just bring us animals.

03:09.140 --> 03:13.660
An enormous quantity of warm air also comes with it, in order to reduce the same heat

03:13.660 --> 03:18.940
which it brings to the shores of Europe, we would need 1 million nuclear power plants.

03:18.940 --> 03:21.900
That's why we also call the Gulf Stream a heat pump.

03:21.900 --> 03:26.900
Without it, the temperature would be significantly colder here, at least 5 to 10 degrees.

03:26.900 --> 03:32.340
Instead of lush fields, we would have long winters and sparse ice-covered landscapes in Europe.

03:32.340 --> 03:36.860
In the last few years, scientists and pundits in the media have repeatedly expressed the

03:36.860 --> 03:41.980
fear that the Gulf Stream could come to a standstill due to climate change.

03:41.980 --> 03:46.020
Because if the polar caps actually melt, the salt content in the water off Greenland

03:46.020 --> 03:49.180
would fall, as would its density.

03:49.180 --> 03:55.820
The North Atlantic current would no longer be heavy enough, and so it wouldn't sink as usual.

03:55.820 --> 04:01.860
In the worst case, that would bring the Gulf Stream, our heat pump, to a stop.

04:01.860 --> 04:07.860
Some climate experts also assume that climate change could compensate for this effect.

04:07.860 --> 04:11.860
We know that it can be normal for the climate to change by looking at the development of

04:11.860 --> 04:15.060
the Earth over the last few million years.

04:15.060 --> 04:18.500
There are ice ages and warm periods.

04:18.500 --> 04:23.620
In the last ice age, a gigantic flood of melting water crippled the heat-bringing North Atlantic

04:23.620 --> 04:28.780
current covering the northern hemisphere in ice.

04:28.780 --> 04:32.580
Scientists have different views on the impact that climate change will have on the global

04:32.580 --> 04:35.020
ocean conveyor belt.

04:35.020 --> 04:36.340
But one thing is clear.

04:36.340 --> 04:40.660
When the climate changes, then the complex system of ocean currents and winds, which

04:40.660 --> 04:46.300
has remained fairly stable since the last ice age, will change in ways that we don't yet understand.
