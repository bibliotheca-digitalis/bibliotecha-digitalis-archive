1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,560
At this very second, you are on a narrow ledge between life and death.

2
00:00:06,560 --> 00:00:10,860
You probably don't feel it, but there's an incredible amount of activity going on

3
00:00:10,860 --> 00:00:12,620
inside you.

4
00:00:12,620 --> 00:00:16,460
And this activity can never stop.

5
00:00:16,460 --> 00:00:21,940
Picture yourself as a slinky falling down an escalator moving upwards.

6
00:00:21,940 --> 00:00:26,780
The falling part represents the self-replicating processes of your cells.

7
00:00:26,780 --> 00:00:31,860
The escalator represents the laws of physics driving you forwards.

8
00:00:31,860 --> 00:00:36,840
To be alive is to be in motion, but never arriving anywhere.

9
00:00:36,840 --> 00:00:41,740
If you reach the top of the escalator, there's no more falling possible, and you are dead

10
00:00:41,740 --> 00:00:43,680
forever.

11
00:00:43,680 --> 00:00:48,860
Somewhat unsettlingly, the universe wants you to reach the top.

12
00:00:48,860 --> 00:00:52,140
How do you avoid that, and why are you alive?

13
00:00:56,780 --> 00:01:03,820
All life is based on the cell.

14
00:01:03,820 --> 00:01:08,960
A cell is a piece of the dead universe that separated itself from the rest so it could

15
00:01:08,960 --> 00:01:11,500
do its own thing for a while.

16
00:01:11,500 --> 00:01:17,500
When this separation breaks down, it dies and joins the rest of the dead universe again.

17
00:01:17,500 --> 00:01:23,200
Unfortunately, the universe would like for life to be done with doing its own thing.

18
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:29,420
For some reason, it's not a fan of exciting things, but tries to be as boring as possible.

19
00:01:29,420 --> 00:01:34,760
We call this principle entropy, and it's a fundamental rule of our universe.

20
00:01:34,760 --> 00:01:40,040
It's pretty complicated and counterintuitive, so we'll explain it in detail in another

21
00:01:40,040 --> 00:01:41,040
video.

22
00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:46,320
For now, all you need to know is living things are inherently exciting.

23
00:01:46,320 --> 00:01:52,760
A cell is filled up with millions of proteins and millions more simpler molecules like water.

24
00:01:52,760 --> 00:01:57,060
Thousands of complex, self-replicating processes are happening up to hundreds of thousands

25
00:01:57,060 --> 00:01:59,520
of times every second.

26
00:01:59,520 --> 00:02:05,080
To stay alive and exciting, it has to constantly work to keep itself from achieving entropy

27
00:02:05,080 --> 00:02:07,680
and becoming boring and dead.

28
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:12,340
The cell has to maintain the separation from the rest of the universe.

29
00:02:12,340 --> 00:02:16,400
It's doing this, for example, by keeping the concentration of certain molecules different

30
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:21,660
on the inside and the outside by actively pumping out excess molecules.

31
00:02:21,660 --> 00:02:25,860
To do stuff like this, a cell needs energy.

32
00:02:25,860 --> 00:02:31,240
Energy is the ability of things in the universe to do work, to move or manipulate a thing,

33
00:02:31,240 --> 00:02:33,380
to create change.

34
00:02:33,380 --> 00:02:38,020
This ability cannot be created or destroyed, the set amount of energy in the universe will

35
00:02:38,020 --> 00:02:39,260
never change.

36
00:02:39,260 --> 00:02:42,520
We don't know why, it just is that way.

37
00:02:42,520 --> 00:02:47,180
So billions of years ago, one of the most crucial challenges for the first living beings

38
00:02:47,180 --> 00:02:49,940
was to get usable energy.

39
00:02:49,940 --> 00:02:54,140
We don't know a lot about the first cells, except that they got their energy from simple

40
00:02:54,140 --> 00:02:56,260
chemical reactions.

41
00:02:56,260 --> 00:02:59,400
And they found the ultimate energy transfer system.

42
00:02:59,400 --> 00:03:02,160
The energetic building block of life.

43
00:03:02,160 --> 00:03:06,680
The molecule adenosine triphosphate, or ATP.

44
00:03:06,680 --> 00:03:11,700
Its structure makes it uniquely good at accepting and releasing energy.

45
00:03:11,700 --> 00:03:17,020
When a cell needs energy, for example to pump out molecules or to repair a broken micromachine,

46
00:03:17,020 --> 00:03:23,060
it can break down ATP and use the chemical energy to do work and create change.

47
00:03:23,060 --> 00:03:26,780
This is why living beings are able to do stuff.

48
00:03:26,780 --> 00:03:31,600
We don't know when or how exactly the first ATP molecule was made on Earth.

49
00:03:31,600 --> 00:03:37,080
But every living thing we know uses ATP or something very similar to keep its internal

50
00:03:37,080 --> 00:03:39,180
machinery running.

51
00:03:39,180 --> 00:03:47,100
It's crucial for almost every process plants, fungi, bacteria, and animals need to survive.

52
00:03:47,100 --> 00:03:52,500
Without ATP, no life on Earth, possibly anywhere.

53
00:03:52,500 --> 00:03:57,720
While breaking down chemicals for energy is nice and all, early life did miss out on the

54
00:03:57,720 --> 00:04:02,300
greatest available source of energy, the Sun.

55
00:04:02,300 --> 00:04:08,860
The Sun merges atoms and radiates photons away that carry energy into the solar system.

56
00:04:08,860 --> 00:04:12,420
But this energy is raw and indigestible.

57
00:04:12,420 --> 00:04:15,060
It needs to be refined.

58
00:04:15,060 --> 00:04:20,380
After hundreds of millions of years of evolution, finally, a cell figured out how to eat the

59
00:04:20,380 --> 00:04:21,380
Sun.

60
00:04:21,380 --> 00:04:26,540
It absorbed radiation and converted much of it into neat little chemical packages that

61
00:04:26,540 --> 00:04:28,620
it could use to stay alive.

62
00:04:28,620 --> 00:04:31,980
We call this process photosynthesis.

63
00:04:31,980 --> 00:04:37,260
You take photons that are wobbly with electromagnetic energy and use a part of this energy to merge

64
00:04:37,260 --> 00:04:40,400
and combine different molecules together.

65
00:04:40,400 --> 00:04:47,140
The electromagnetic energy is converted into chemical energy stored in the ATP molecule.

66
00:04:47,140 --> 00:04:52,860
This process became even better as some cells learned to create better chemical packages,

67
00:04:52,860 --> 00:05:00,300
glucose or sugar, easy to break down, high in energy, and pretty tasty.

68
00:05:00,300 --> 00:05:05,260
This is so convenient that some cells decided that instead of doing all that pesky photosynthesis

69
00:05:05,260 --> 00:05:09,940
work themselves, they would just swallow other cells that did and take their glucose

70
00:05:09,940 --> 00:05:11,980
and ATP.

71
00:05:11,980 --> 00:05:17,580
This is widely considered one of the biggest anime betrayals in evolutionary history.

72
00:05:17,580 --> 00:05:20,180
And so things went on.

73
00:05:20,180 --> 00:05:24,240
Photosynthesizing cells could mostly harness energy at their surfaces, which limited their

74
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:29,240
maximum energy production, which limited their evolutionary avenues somewhat.

75
00:05:29,240 --> 00:05:31,220
So time passed.

76
00:05:31,220 --> 00:05:34,940
Some cells made sugar, others ate them.

77
00:05:34,940 --> 00:05:36,100
Some did its thing.

78
00:05:36,100 --> 00:05:41,380
But overall, things stayed pretty much the same for hundreds of millions of years.

79
00:05:41,380 --> 00:05:46,980
Until one day, a cell ate another and did not kill it.

80
00:05:46,980 --> 00:05:50,580
Instead, they became one cell.

81
00:05:50,580 --> 00:05:56,500
Nothing had changed that day, but Earth would be different forever.

82
00:05:56,500 --> 00:06:03,700
This cell became the ancestor of all animals on this planet, blue whales, amoeba, dinosaurs,

83
00:06:03,700 --> 00:06:08,420
jellyfish, pink fairy armadillos, and sunda colugos.

84
00:06:08,420 --> 00:06:10,500
And of course, you.

85
00:06:10,500 --> 00:06:14,740
All can trace back their existence to this moment.

86
00:06:14,740 --> 00:06:20,020
The merging of two living beings is so important because when those two cells became one, they

87
00:06:20,020 --> 00:06:22,780
became way more powerful.

88
00:06:22,780 --> 00:06:27,440
The formerly independent cell in the inside could stop trying to survive.

89
00:06:27,440 --> 00:06:31,520
It could concentrate on one thing, make ATP.

90
00:06:31,520 --> 00:06:36,120
It became the powerhouse of the cell, the first mitochondria.

91
00:06:36,120 --> 00:06:41,420
The host cell's job became to ensure survival in the dangerous world and provide the mitochondria

92
00:06:41,420 --> 00:06:43,780
with food.

93
00:06:43,780 --> 00:06:48,940
Mitochondria basically reverse photosynthesis in a similarly complex process.

94
00:06:48,940 --> 00:06:53,260
They take sugar molecules that we got from eating other living things, combust them with

95
00:06:53,260 --> 00:06:59,340
oxygen and precursor molecules to make new, energy-rich ATP molecules.

96
00:06:59,340 --> 00:07:04,920
This process works like a tiny furnace and spits out waste products like CO2, water,

97
00:07:04,920 --> 00:07:09,600
and a little bit of kinetic energy that you experience as body heat.

98
00:07:09,600 --> 00:07:14,020
This first division of labor meant the new cell had way more energy available than any

99
00:07:14,020 --> 00:07:20,440
cell before, which meant more possibilities for evolution to enable more complex cells.

100
00:07:20,440 --> 00:07:26,420
At some point, these cells began to form small groups or communities, which led to multicellular

101
00:07:26,420 --> 00:07:29,540
life and finally to you.

102
00:07:29,540 --> 00:07:35,580
Today, you are a pile of trillions of cells, each filled with dozens, if not hundreds of

103
00:07:35,580 --> 00:07:39,940
little machines that provide you with usable energy to stay alive.

104
00:07:39,940 --> 00:07:45,300
If this process is interrupted, even for a few minutes, you die.

105
00:07:45,300 --> 00:07:51,060
But if life is so fragile, wouldn't it be a good idea to store ATP, like we store sugar

106
00:07:51,060 --> 00:07:56,220
in our fat cells so we don't die if we stop breathing for a while?

107
00:07:56,220 --> 00:08:00,740
If life has solved so many problems to make you live today, what's up with the dying

108
00:08:00,740 --> 00:08:02,600
quickly thing?

109
00:08:02,600 --> 00:08:08,220
Even simple bacteria like E. coli make about 50 times their body weight in ATP for every

110
00:08:08,220 --> 00:08:10,260
cell division.

111
00:08:10,260 --> 00:08:15,060
Your trillions of cells need a lot of ATP to keep you around.

112
00:08:15,060 --> 00:08:21,340
Every day, your body produces and converts about 90 million, billion, billion molecules

113
00:08:21,340 --> 00:08:24,820
of ATP, about your own body weight.

114
00:08:24,820 --> 00:08:30,660
You need a whole person's worth of ATP just to make it through a single day.

115
00:08:30,660 --> 00:08:35,620
Even storing enough ATP to last you a few minutes is basically impossible.

116
00:08:35,620 --> 00:08:40,340
An ATP molecule is really good for shifting energy around quickly, but it's terrible for

117
00:08:40,340 --> 00:08:47,280
storage since it has only 1% of a glucose molecule's energy at three times its mass.

118
00:08:47,280 --> 00:08:52,900
So ATP is constantly produced and used up fairly quickly.

119
00:08:52,900 --> 00:08:57,580
This was the short and simplified story of the molecule that allows you to be different

120
00:08:57,580 --> 00:09:01,960
from the dead universe and to be the slinky on the escalator.

121
00:09:01,960 --> 00:09:04,380
It is a weird story.

122
00:09:04,380 --> 00:09:07,760
There is this molecule you need to survive at all times.

123
00:09:07,760 --> 00:09:12,980
You need it to keep moving because even a short break brings your slinky to a stop.

124
00:09:12,980 --> 00:09:15,360
And you need to make it yourself.

125
00:09:15,360 --> 00:09:20,020
It's like driving a car at full speed while producing fuel in the trunk with junk that

126
00:09:20,020 --> 00:09:22,860
you pick up from the side of the road.

127
00:09:22,860 --> 00:09:28,020
As far as we know, this all began billions of years ago when tiny parts of the dead universe

128
00:09:28,020 --> 00:09:31,900
came together and became something else for a moment.

129
00:09:31,900 --> 00:09:33,860
It could keep itself going.

130
00:09:33,860 --> 00:09:35,380
It could grow.

131
00:09:35,380 --> 00:09:40,620
That moment set the slinky in motion and it's been going ever since.

132
00:09:40,620 --> 00:09:45,580
From the very first cells to you watching this now.

133
00:09:45,580 --> 00:09:50,260
At some point, you will merge with the rest of the dead universe again.

134
00:09:50,420 --> 00:09:53,480
Maybe you'll tell it stories about your adventures.

135
00:09:53,480 --> 00:09:55,980
Maybe not.

136
00:09:55,980 --> 00:10:00,620
But before you find out, you get to do what life does best.

137
00:10:00,620 --> 00:10:06,940
Making a dead universe much more interesting.

138
00:10:06,940 --> 00:10:12,600
If you are currently bored for whatever reason and you want to make your life more interesting,

139
00:10:12,600 --> 00:10:14,740
we've got something for you.

140
00:10:14,740 --> 00:10:19,180
We partnered with Skillshare, an online learning community that offers thousands of classes

141
00:10:19,180 --> 00:10:25,500
for all skill levels on tons of creative skills like illustration, animation, cooking, creative

142
00:10:25,500 --> 00:10:28,140
writing, or film and video.

143
00:10:28,140 --> 00:10:33,400
Learning something while creating stuff for yourself is pretty fun and fulfilling.

144
00:10:33,400 --> 00:10:37,520
If you want to learn animation, we made a few Skillshare classes where we explained

145
00:10:37,520 --> 00:10:42,940
how we animated scenes from our videos with video lessons and hands-on projects.

146
00:10:42,940 --> 00:10:47,980

154
00:11:12,740 --> 00:11:14,860
being stuck inside.
