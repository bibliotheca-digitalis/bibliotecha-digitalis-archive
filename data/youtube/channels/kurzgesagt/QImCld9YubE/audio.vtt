00:00.000 --> 00:06.560
At this very second, you are on a narrow ledge between life and death.

00:06.560 --> 00:10.860
You probably don't feel it, but there's an incredible amount of activity going on

00:10.860 --> 00:12.620
inside you.

00:12.620 --> 00:16.460
And this activity can never stop.

00:16.460 --> 00:21.940
Picture yourself as a slinky falling down an escalator moving upwards.

00:21.940 --> 00:26.780
The falling part represents the self-replicating processes of your cells.

00:26.780 --> 00:31.860
The escalator represents the laws of physics driving you forwards.

00:31.860 --> 00:36.840
To be alive is to be in motion, but never arriving anywhere.

00:36.840 --> 00:41.740
If you reach the top of the escalator, there's no more falling possible, and you are dead

00:41.740 --> 00:43.680
forever.

00:43.680 --> 00:48.860
Somewhat unsettlingly, the universe wants you to reach the top.

00:48.860 --> 00:52.140
How do you avoid that, and why are you alive?

00:56.780 --> 01:03.820
All life is based on the cell.

01:03.820 --> 01:08.960
A cell is a piece of the dead universe that separated itself from the rest so it could

01:08.960 --> 01:11.500
do its own thing for a while.

01:11.500 --> 01:17.500
When this separation breaks down, it dies and joins the rest of the dead universe again.

01:17.500 --> 01:23.200
Unfortunately, the universe would like for life to be done with doing its own thing.

01:23.200 --> 01:29.420
For some reason, it's not a fan of exciting things, but tries to be as boring as possible.

01:29.420 --> 01:34.760
We call this principle entropy, and it's a fundamental rule of our universe.

01:34.760 --> 01:40.040
It's pretty complicated and counterintuitive, so we'll explain it in detail in another

01:40.040 --> 01:41.040
video.

01:41.040 --> 01:46.320
For now, all you need to know is living things are inherently exciting.

01:46.320 --> 01:52.760
A cell is filled up with millions of proteins and millions more simpler molecules like water.

01:52.760 --> 01:57.060
Thousands of complex, self-replicating processes are happening up to hundreds of thousands

01:57.060 --> 01:59.520
of times every second.

01:59.520 --> 02:05.080
To stay alive and exciting, it has to constantly work to keep itself from achieving entropy

02:05.080 --> 02:07.680
and becoming boring and dead.

02:07.680 --> 02:12.340
The cell has to maintain the separation from the rest of the universe.

02:12.340 --> 02:16.400
It's doing this, for example, by keeping the concentration of certain molecules different

02:16.400 --> 02:21.660
on the inside and the outside by actively pumping out excess molecules.

02:21.660 --> 02:25.860
To do stuff like this, a cell needs energy.

02:25.860 --> 02:31.240
Energy is the ability of things in the universe to do work, to move or manipulate a thing,

02:31.240 --> 02:33.380
to create change.

02:33.380 --> 02:38.020
This ability cannot be created or destroyed, the set amount of energy in the universe will

02:38.020 --> 02:39.260
never change.

02:39.260 --> 02:42.520
We don't know why, it just is that way.

02:42.520 --> 02:47.180
So billions of years ago, one of the most crucial challenges for the first living beings

02:47.180 --> 02:49.940
was to get usable energy.

02:49.940 --> 02:54.140
We don't know a lot about the first cells, except that they got their energy from simple

02:54.140 --> 02:56.260
chemical reactions.

02:56.260 --> 02:59.400
And they found the ultimate energy transfer system.

02:59.400 --> 03:02.160
The energetic building block of life.

03:02.160 --> 03:06.680
The molecule adenosine triphosphate, or ATP.

03:06.680 --> 03:11.700
Its structure makes it uniquely good at accepting and releasing energy.

03:11.700 --> 03:17.020
When a cell needs energy, for example to pump out molecules or to repair a broken micromachine,

03:17.020 --> 03:23.060
it can break down ATP and use the chemical energy to do work and create change.

03:23.060 --> 03:26.780
This is why living beings are able to do stuff.

03:26.780 --> 03:31.600
We don't know when or how exactly the first ATP molecule was made on Earth.

03:31.600 --> 03:37.080
But every living thing we know uses ATP or something very similar to keep its internal

03:37.080 --> 03:39.180
machinery running.

03:39.180 --> 03:47.100
It's crucial for almost every process plants, fungi, bacteria, and animals need to survive.

03:47.100 --> 03:52.500
Without ATP, no life on Earth, possibly anywhere.

03:52.500 --> 03:57.720
While breaking down chemicals for energy is nice and all, early life did miss out on the

03:57.720 --> 04:02.300
greatest available source of energy, the Sun.

04:02.300 --> 04:08.860
The Sun merges atoms and radiates photons away that carry energy into the solar system.

04:08.860 --> 04:12.420
But this energy is raw and indigestible.

04:12.420 --> 04:15.060
It needs to be refined.

04:15.060 --> 04:20.380
After hundreds of millions of years of evolution, finally, a cell figured out how to eat the

04:20.380 --> 04:21.380
Sun.

04:21.380 --> 04:26.540
It absorbed radiation and converted much of it into neat little chemical packages that

04:26.540 --> 04:28.620
it could use to stay alive.

04:28.620 --> 04:31.980
We call this process photosynthesis.

04:31.980 --> 04:37.260
You take photons that are wobbly with electromagnetic energy and use a part of this energy to merge

04:37.260 --> 04:40.400
and combine different molecules together.

04:40.400 --> 04:47.140
The electromagnetic energy is converted into chemical energy stored in the ATP molecule.

04:47.140 --> 04:52.860
This process became even better as some cells learned to create better chemical packages,

04:52.860 --> 05:00.300
glucose or sugar, easy to break down, high in energy, and pretty tasty.

05:00.300 --> 05:05.260
This is so convenient that some cells decided that instead of doing all that pesky photosynthesis

05:05.260 --> 05:09.940
work themselves, they would just swallow other cells that did and take their glucose

05:09.940 --> 05:11.980
and ATP.

05:11.980 --> 05:17.580
This is widely considered one of the biggest anime betrayals in evolutionary history.

05:17.580 --> 05:20.180
And so things went on.

05:20.180 --> 05:24.240
Photosynthesizing cells could mostly harness energy at their surfaces, which limited their

05:24.240 --> 05:29.240
maximum energy production, which limited their evolutionary avenues somewhat.

05:29.240 --> 05:31.220
So time passed.

05:31.220 --> 05:34.940
Some cells made sugar, others ate them.

05:34.940 --> 05:36.100
Some did its thing.

05:36.100 --> 05:41.380
But overall, things stayed pretty much the same for hundreds of millions of years.

05:41.380 --> 05:46.980
Until one day, a cell ate another and did not kill it.

05:46.980 --> 05:50.580
Instead, they became one cell.

05:50.580 --> 05:56.500
Nothing had changed that day, but Earth would be different forever.

05:56.500 --> 06:03.700
This cell became the ancestor of all animals on this planet, blue whales, amoeba, dinosaurs,

06:03.700 --> 06:08.420
jellyfish, pink fairy armadillos, and sunda colugos.

06:08.420 --> 06:10.500
And of course, you.

06:10.500 --> 06:14.740
All can trace back their existence to this moment.

06:14.740 --> 06:20.020
The merging of two living beings is so important because when those two cells became one, they

06:20.020 --> 06:22.780
became way more powerful.

06:22.780 --> 06:27.440
The formerly independent cell in the inside could stop trying to survive.

06:27.440 --> 06:31.520
It could concentrate on one thing, make ATP.

06:31.520 --> 06:36.120
It became the powerhouse of the cell, the first mitochondria.

06:36.120 --> 06:41.420
The host cell's job became to ensure survival in the dangerous world and provide the mitochondria

06:41.420 --> 06:43.780
with food.

06:43.780 --> 06:48.940
Mitochondria basically reverse photosynthesis in a similarly complex process.

06:48.940 --> 06:53.260
They take sugar molecules that we got from eating other living things, combust them with

06:53.260 --> 06:59.340
oxygen and precursor molecules to make new, energy-rich ATP molecules.

06:59.340 --> 07:04.920
This process works like a tiny furnace and spits out waste products like CO2, water,

07:04.920 --> 07:09.600
and a little bit of kinetic energy that you experience as body heat.

07:09.600 --> 07:14.020
This first division of labor meant the new cell had way more energy available than any

07:14.020 --> 07:20.440
cell before, which meant more possibilities for evolution to enable more complex cells.

07:20.440 --> 07:26.420
At some point, these cells began to form small groups or communities, which led to multicellular

07:26.420 --> 07:29.540
life and finally to you.

07:29.540 --> 07:35.580
Today, you are a pile of trillions of cells, each filled with dozens, if not hundreds of

07:35.580 --> 07:39.940
little machines that provide you with usable energy to stay alive.

07:39.940 --> 07:45.300
If this process is interrupted, even for a few minutes, you die.

07:45.300 --> 07:51.060
But if life is so fragile, wouldn't it be a good idea to store ATP, like we store sugar

07:51.060 --> 07:56.220
in our fat cells so we don't die if we stop breathing for a while?

07:56.220 --> 08:00.740
If life has solved so many problems to make you live today, what's up with the dying

08:00.740 --> 08:02.600
quickly thing?

08:02.600 --> 08:08.220
Even simple bacteria like E. coli make about 50 times their body weight in ATP for every

08:08.220 --> 08:10.260
cell division.

08:10.260 --> 08:15.060
Your trillions of cells need a lot of ATP to keep you around.

08:15.060 --> 08:21.340
Every day, your body produces and converts about 90 million, billion, billion molecules

08:21.340 --> 08:24.820
of ATP, about your own body weight.

08:24.820 --> 08:30.660
You need a whole person's worth of ATP just to make it through a single day.

08:30.660 --> 08:35.620
Even storing enough ATP to last you a few minutes is basically impossible.

08:35.620 --> 08:40.340
An ATP molecule is really good for shifting energy around quickly, but it's terrible for

08:40.340 --> 08:47.280
storage since it has only 1% of a glucose molecule's energy at three times its mass.

08:47.280 --> 08:52.900
So ATP is constantly produced and used up fairly quickly.

08:52.900 --> 08:57.580
This was the short and simplified story of the molecule that allows you to be different

08:57.580 --> 09:01.960
from the dead universe and to be the slinky on the escalator.

09:01.960 --> 09:04.380
It is a weird story.

09:04.380 --> 09:07.760
There is this molecule you need to survive at all times.

09:07.760 --> 09:12.980
You need it to keep moving because even a short break brings your slinky to a stop.

09:12.980 --> 09:15.360
And you need to make it yourself.

09:15.360 --> 09:20.020
It's like driving a car at full speed while producing fuel in the trunk with junk that

09:20.020 --> 09:22.860
you pick up from the side of the road.

09:22.860 --> 09:28.020
As far as we know, this all began billions of years ago when tiny parts of the dead universe

09:28.020 --> 09:31.900
came together and became something else for a moment.

09:31.900 --> 09:33.860
It could keep itself going.

09:33.860 --> 09:35.380
It could grow.

09:35.380 --> 09:40.620
That moment set the slinky in motion and it's been going ever since.

09:40.620 --> 09:45.580
From the very first cells to you watching this now.

09:45.580 --> 09:50.260
At some point, you will merge with the rest of the dead universe again.

09:50.420 --> 09:53.480
Maybe you'll tell it stories about your adventures.

09:53.480 --> 09:55.980
Maybe not.

09:55.980 --> 10:00.620
But before you find out, you get to do what life does best.

10:00.620 --> 10:06.940
Making a dead universe much more interesting.

10:06.940 --> 10:12.600
If you are currently bored for whatever reason and you want to make your life more interesting,

10:12.600 --> 10:14.740
we've got something for you.
