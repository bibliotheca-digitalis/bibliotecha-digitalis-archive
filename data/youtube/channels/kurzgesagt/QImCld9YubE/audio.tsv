0	6560	At this very second, you are on a narrow ledge between life and death.
6560	10860	You probably don't feel it, but there's an incredible amount of activity going on
10860	12620	inside you.
12620	16460	And this activity can never stop.
16460	21940	Picture yourself as a slinky falling down an escalator moving upwards.
21940	26780	The falling part represents the self-replicating processes of your cells.
26780	31860	The escalator represents the laws of physics driving you forwards.
31860	36840	To be alive is to be in motion, but never arriving anywhere.
36840	41740	If you reach the top of the escalator, there's no more falling possible, and you are dead
41740	43680	forever.
43680	48860	Somewhat unsettlingly, the universe wants you to reach the top.
48860	52140	How do you avoid that, and why are you alive?
56780	63820	All life is based on the cell.
63820	68960	A cell is a piece of the dead universe that separated itself from the rest so it could
68960	71500	do its own thing for a while.
71500	77500	When this separation breaks down, it dies and joins the rest of the dead universe again.
77500	83200	Unfortunately, the universe would like for life to be done with doing its own thing.
83200	89420	For some reason, it's not a fan of exciting things, but tries to be as boring as possible.
89420	94760	We call this principle entropy, and it's a fundamental rule of our universe.
94760	100040	It's pretty complicated and counterintuitive, so we'll explain it in detail in another
100040	101040	video.
101040	106320	For now, all you need to know is living things are inherently exciting.
106320	112760	A cell is filled up with millions of proteins and millions more simpler molecules like water.
112760	117060	Thousands of complex, self-replicating processes are happening up to hundreds of thousands
117060	119520	of times every second.
119520	125080	To stay alive and exciting, it has to constantly work to keep itself from achieving entropy
125080	127680	and becoming boring and dead.
127680	132340	The cell has to maintain the separation from the rest of the universe.
132340	136400	It's doing this, for example, by keeping the concentration of certain molecules different
136400	141660	on the inside and the outside by actively pumping out excess molecules.
141660	145860	To do stuff like this, a cell needs energy.
145860	151240	Energy is the ability of things in the universe to do work, to move or manipulate a thing,
151240	153380	to create change.
153380	158020	This ability cannot be created or destroyed, the set amount of energy in the universe will
158020	159260	never change.
159260	162520	We don't know why, it just is that way.
162520	167180	So billions of years ago, one of the most crucial challenges for the first living beings
167180	169940	was to get usable energy.
169940	174140	We don't know a lot about the first cells, except that they got their energy from simple
174140	176260	chemical reactions.
176260	179400	And they found the ultimate energy transfer system.
179400	182160	The energetic building block of life.
182160	186680	The molecule adenosine triphosphate, or ATP.
186680	191700	Its structure makes it uniquely good at accepting and releasing energy.
191700	197020	When a cell needs energy, for example to pump out molecules or to repair a broken micromachine,
197020	203060	it can break down ATP and use the chemical energy to do work and create change.
203060	206780	This is why living beings are able to do stuff.
206780	211600	We don't know when or how exactly the first ATP molecule was made on Earth.
211600	217080	But every living thing we know uses ATP or something very similar to keep its internal
217080	219180	machinery running.
219180	227100	It's crucial for almost every process plants, fungi, bacteria, and animals need to survive.
227100	232500	Without ATP, no life on Earth, possibly anywhere.
232500	237720	While breaking down chemicals for energy is nice and all, early life did miss out on the
237720	242300	greatest available source of energy, the Sun.
242300	248860	The Sun merges atoms and radiates photons away that carry energy into the solar system.
248860	252420	But this energy is raw and indigestible.
252420	255060	It needs to be refined.
255060	260380	After hundreds of millions of years of evolution, finally, a cell figured out how to eat the
260380	261380	Sun.
261380	266540	It absorbed radiation and converted much of it into neat little chemical packages that
266540	268620	it could use to stay alive.
268620	271980	We call this process photosynthesis.
271980	277260	You take photons that are wobbly with electromagnetic energy and use a part of this energy to merge
277260	280400	and combine different molecules together.
280400	287140	The electromagnetic energy is converted into chemical energy stored in the ATP molecule.
287140	292860	This process became even better as some cells learned to create better chemical packages,
292860	300300	glucose or sugar, easy to break down, high in energy, and pretty tasty.
300300	305260	This is so convenient that some cells decided that instead of doing all that pesky photosynthesis
305260	309940	work themselves, they would just swallow other cells that did and take their glucose
309940	311980	and ATP.
311980	317580	This is widely considered one of the biggest anime betrayals in evolutionary history.
317580	320180	And so things went on.
320180	324240	Photosynthesizing cells could mostly harness energy at their surfaces, which limited their
324240	329240	maximum energy production, which limited their evolutionary avenues somewhat.
329240	331220	So time passed.
331220	334940	Some cells made sugar, others ate them.
334940	336100	Some did its thing.
336100	341380	But overall, things stayed pretty much the same for hundreds of millions of years.
341380	346980	Until one day, a cell ate another and did not kill it.
346980	350580	Instead, they became one cell.
350580	356500	Nothing had changed that day, but Earth would be different forever.
356500	363700	This cell became the ancestor of all animals on this planet, blue whales, amoeba, dinosaurs,
363700	368420	jellyfish, pink fairy armadillos, and sunda colugos.
368420	370500	And of course, you.
370500	374740	All can trace back their existence to this moment.
374740	380020	The merging of two living beings is so important because when those two cells became one, they
380020	382780	became way more powerful.
382780	387440	The formerly independent cell in the inside could stop trying to survive.
387440	391520	It could concentrate on one thing, make ATP.
391520	396120	It became the powerhouse of the cell, the first mitochondria.
396120	401420	The host cell's job became to ensure survival in the dangerous world and provide the mitochondria
401420	403780	with food.
403780	408940	Mitochondria basically reverse photosynthesis in a similarly complex process.
408940	413260	They take sugar molecules that we got from eating other living things, combust them with
413260	419340	oxygen and precursor molecules to make new, energy-rich ATP molecules.
419340	424920	This process works like a tiny furnace and spits out waste products like CO2, water,
424920	429600	and a little bit of kinetic energy that you experience as body heat.
429600	434020	This first division of labor meant the new cell had way more energy available than any
434020	440440	cell before, which meant more possibilities for evolution to enable more complex cells.
440440	446420	At some point, these cells began to form small groups or communities, which led to multicellular
446420	449540	life and finally to you.
449540	455580	Today, you are a pile of trillions of cells, each filled with dozens, if not hundreds of
455580	459940	little machines that provide you with usable energy to stay alive.
459940	465300	If this process is interrupted, even for a few minutes, you die.
465300	471060	But if life is so fragile, wouldn't it be a good idea to store ATP, like we store sugar
471060	476220	in our fat cells so we don't die if we stop breathing for a while?
476220	480740	If life has solved so many problems to make you live today, what's up with the dying
480740	482600	quickly thing?
482600	488220	Even simple bacteria like E. coli make about 50 times their body weight in ATP for every
488220	490260	cell division.
490260	495060	Your trillions of cells need a lot of ATP to keep you around.
495060	501340	Every day, your body produces and converts about 90 million, billion, billion molecules
501340	504820	of ATP, about your own body weight.
504820	510660	You need a whole person's worth of ATP just to make it through a single day.
510660	515620	Even storing enough ATP to last you a few minutes is basically impossible.
515620	520340	An ATP molecule is really good for shifting energy around quickly, but it's terrible for
520340	527280	storage since it has only 1% of a glucose molecule's energy at three times its mass.
527280	532900	So ATP is constantly produced and used up fairly quickly.
532900	537580	This was the short and simplified story of the molecule that allows you to be different
537580	541960	from the dead universe and to be the slinky on the escalator.
541960	544380	It is a weird story.
544380	547760	There is this molecule you need to survive at all times.
547760	552980	You need it to keep moving because even a short break brings your slinky to a stop.
552980	555360	And you need to make it yourself.
555360	560020	It's like driving a car at full speed while producing fuel in the trunk with junk that
560020	562860	you pick up from the side of the road.
562860	568020	As far as we know, this all began billions of years ago when tiny parts of the dead universe
568020	571900	came together and became something else for a moment.
571900	573860	It could keep itself going.
573860	575380	It could grow.
575380	580620	That moment set the slinky in motion and it's been going ever since.
580620	585580	From the very first cells to you watching this now.
585580	590260	At some point, you will merge with the rest of the dead universe again.
590420	593480	Maybe you'll tell it stories about your adventures.
593480	595980	Maybe not.
595980	600620	But before you find out, you get to do what life does best.
600620	606940	Making a dead universe much more interesting.
606940	612600	If you are currently bored for whatever reason and you want to make your life more interesting,
