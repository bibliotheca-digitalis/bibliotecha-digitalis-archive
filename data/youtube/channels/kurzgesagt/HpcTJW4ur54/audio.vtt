00:00.000 --> 00:05.400
Mars is a disappointing hellhole lacking practically everything we need to stay alive.

00:05.400 --> 00:10.600
It looks like we'll only ever have small crews spend a miserable time hidden underground.

00:10.600 --> 00:14.600
Except we could terraform it into a green new world.

00:14.600 --> 00:21.600
But to solve the planet's problems, we first need to make it worse and turn it into oceans of lava with gigantic lasers.

00:21.600 --> 00:24.600
This isn't a far-fetched science fiction tale.

00:24.600 --> 00:30.400
Terraforming Mars is possible on the kind of timescale our ancestors built great monuments in.

00:30.400 --> 00:38.900
If humanity solves some of its pressing problems and ventures into space to expand into the solar system, this may not be that far off.

00:38.900 --> 00:42.400
Okay, so how do we terraform Mars quickly?

00:42.400 --> 00:44.400
Well, it's complicated.

00:44.400 --> 00:56.400
Mars is dry and has no soil to grow anything.

00:56.400 --> 01:01.800
Its atmosphere is too thin to breathe or protect us from radiation, giving you a high risk of cancer.

01:01.800 --> 01:07.400
So to turn it into a new home for humanity, we have to give it a proper atmosphere similar to Earth's.

01:07.400 --> 01:17.400
It should be made of 21% oxygen, 79% nitrogen, and a tiny bit of CO2 at an average temperature of 14 degrees Celsius and under one bar of pressure.

01:17.400 --> 01:23.400
We have to create oceans and rivers, and then the ground has to be weathered into fertile soil to host living things.

01:23.400 --> 01:31.400
Then we need to install a biosphere on the surface and prevent it all from being undone by installing protective measures that can stand the test of time.

01:31.400 --> 01:36.400
It is difficult, but a big laser makes it a lot easier.

01:36.400 --> 01:39.400
Challenge one, the atmosphere.

01:39.400 --> 01:46.400
Some 4 billion years ago, Mars had a nice oxygen-rich atmosphere and was home to vast oceans and rivers.

01:46.400 --> 01:51.400
It held onto it for several hundred million years before it got blown away.

01:51.400 --> 01:57.400
Ultraviolet rays broke down the atmospheric gases and then the oceans until they were swept away by solar wind.

01:57.400 --> 02:01.400
Today, Mars is a dry, barren wasteland.

02:01.400 --> 02:09.400
Luckily, a sizable portion of the water is frozen in deep reservoirs and in the polar ice caps, enough to create a very shallow ocean.

02:09.400 --> 02:20.400
And enormous amounts of oxygen are bound as minerals in the Martian rocks, like the oxygen in the iron oxides that give the planet its rust red color, as well as carbon dioxide in carbonates.

02:20.400 --> 02:28.400
To free these gases, we need to reverse the reactions that lock them away by using thermolysis, which occurs at temperatures as high as on the surface of the sun.

02:28.400 --> 02:32.400
In short, we want to melt the surface of Mars.

02:32.400 --> 02:37.400
The best way to do that would be to put lasers in orbit, aiming their beams down on Mars.

02:37.400 --> 02:44.400
The most powerful laser today is the ELI-NP, able to produce beams of 10 petawatts of power for a trillionth of a second.

02:44.400 --> 02:49.400
To melt Mars, we need a laser twice as powerful that runs continuously.

02:49.400 --> 02:54.400
The easiest way is to use a solar-pumped laser that can be powered directly with sunlight.

02:54.400 --> 03:00.400
At its core are metal-infused glass rods that absorb energy and release it as a laser beam.

03:00.400 --> 03:08.400
If we build an array of mirrors in space about 11 times the size of the United States, we can focus enough sunlight onto them to melt Mars.

03:08.400 --> 03:10.400
Let's do it.

03:10.400 --> 03:18.400
As the lasers hit the surface, about 750 kilograms of oxygen and some carbon dioxide emerge from every cubic meter of rock melted.

03:18.400 --> 03:24.400
If we are efficient, our lasers only need to melt through the top 8 meters of the surface to get enough oxygen.

03:24.400 --> 03:26.400
It would look terrifying.

03:26.400 --> 03:32.400
The skies would be shrouded in storms, while the ground would glow red-hot, criss-crossed by currents of lava.

03:32.400 --> 03:37.400
Tireless laser beams sweep over the landscape, leaving trails too bright to look at.

03:37.400 --> 03:40.400
After they pass, the ground cools quickly.

03:41.400 --> 03:48.400
A strange snow falls, the ashes from all the elements that solidify as they cool down like silicon and iron.

03:48.400 --> 03:51.400
Mars is still a cold planet at this point.

03:51.400 --> 04:02.400
A happy side effect of this inferno is that all the water in the polar ice caps and even deep underground rises into the sky as hot steam, forming clouds that rain down over the entire planet.

04:02.400 --> 04:09.400
They would wash out the nastier gases from the atmosphere like chlorine and carry away harmful elements that accumulated on the surface.

04:09.400 --> 04:13.400
In the end, they would form shallow oceans, saltier than on Earth.

04:13.400 --> 04:16.400
We might need to do an extra cleanup afterwards.

04:16.400 --> 04:21.400
It would take about 50 years of continuous lasering to create our oxygen atmosphere.

04:21.400 --> 04:32.400
We could use this opportunity to dig deeper in some places to create the basins for salty oceans or rivers and spare some landmark features like Olympus Mons and Valles Marineris.

04:32.400 --> 04:34.400
We're not done though.

04:34.400 --> 04:39.400
The resulting atmosphere is nearly 100% oxygen and only 0.2 bar.

04:39.400 --> 04:42.400
It's hard to breathe and very flammable.

04:42.400 --> 04:48.400
To make it similar to Earth and a lot safer, we need to add a lot of nitrogen, which Mars is sadly lacking.

04:48.400 --> 04:50.400
We have to import it.

04:50.400 --> 04:57.400
The ideal source is Titan, a large moon of Saturn, covered in a thick atmosphere that's almost entirely nitrogen.

04:57.400 --> 05:02.400
We just have to move 3,000 trillion tons from the outer solar system to Mars.

05:02.400 --> 05:05.400
While that's not easy, it is doable.

05:05.400 --> 05:15.400
To process that much of Titan's atmosphere, we have to construct giant automated factories on its surface powered by our lasers to suck in the atmosphere and compress it into a liquid.

05:15.400 --> 05:22.400
This gets pumped into bullet-shaped tanks, which a mass driver shoots all the way to the Red Planet where they explode and mix with the oxygen.

05:22.400 --> 05:27.400
We've already been able to send individual missions to Saturn in just a few years.

05:27.400 --> 05:32.400
With enough resources, it should be possible to complete the task within two generations.

05:32.400 --> 05:38.400
Of course, it would be much more convenient to have nitrogen left over from terraforming Venus on the side.

05:38.400 --> 05:41.400
We explained this in detail in another video.

05:41.400 --> 05:48.400
So, about a century after the start of the terraforming process, we have a breathable atmosphere that has the right gases.

05:48.400 --> 05:54.400
If the liberated CO2 isn't enough to warm it up to temperatures we can stand, we just add some super greenhouse gases.

05:54.400 --> 06:03.400
Mars at this point resembles a black marble from all the cooling lava, spotted with growing oceans and red patches where the old surface remains untouched.

06:03.400 --> 06:07.400
It's still a wasteland, no better than a desert on Earth.

06:07.400 --> 06:09.400
We need to fill it with life.

06:13.400 --> 06:16.400
Installing a biosphere on a new planet is very difficult.

06:16.400 --> 06:23.400
Unexpected interactions between species or sudden diseases can destabilize it to the point of collapse.

06:23.400 --> 06:27.400
We would probably begin by seeding our young oceans with phytoplankton.

06:27.400 --> 06:33.400
Without competition, it would bloom rapidly, filling up the oceans to become the bottom of an aquatic food chain.

06:33.400 --> 06:39.400
They can be followed by tiny zooplankton, then by fish, maybe even sharks and whales.

06:39.400 --> 06:43.400
If things go well, life in the oceans will thrive.

06:43.400 --> 06:45.400
Life on land is harder.

06:45.400 --> 06:49.400
Plants need nutrient-filled ground to sink their roots into.

06:49.400 --> 06:53.400
But most of the surface is the congealed remains of lava and ash.

06:53.400 --> 07:00.400
We could wait for thousands of years for water and wind to grind it down into finer sands, or try to do it manually.

07:00.400 --> 07:03.400
But we want to be quick, and we have a big laser.

07:03.400 --> 07:11.400
Turning the beam on and off in rapid succession would cause the ground to quickly heat up and contract, which breaks it into smaller and smaller pieces.

07:11.400 --> 07:15.400
Add a bit of water and you get a sort of dark mud.

07:15.400 --> 07:19.400
Into this mud, we can mix fungi and nitrogen-fixing bacteria.

07:19.400 --> 07:25.400
They're able to absorb nitrogen and convert it into nitrate compounds to feed plants.

07:25.400 --> 07:32.400
The first plants we want to bring are native to volcanic islands on Earth, since they're perfectly suited to the laser-blasted Martian landscape.

07:32.400 --> 07:37.400
Eventually, the enriched mud becomes the foundation for grasslands and forests.

07:37.400 --> 07:42.400
In Mars' lower gravity, trees can become very tall very fast.

07:42.400 --> 07:50.400
Their roots gather the nutrients they need and then dig deeper to turn more rocks into soil, forming a self-sustaining ecosystem.

07:50.400 --> 07:55.400
At this point, we can slowly introduce more plant varieties, insects, and animals.

07:55.400 --> 07:57.400
Not mosquitoes, though.

07:57.400 --> 08:02.400
The new biosphere needs to be maintained to prevent it from falling out of balance.

08:02.400 --> 08:07.400
If plants grow too quickly and absorb too much carbon dioxide, the planet cools down too much.

08:07.400 --> 08:12.400
If key species die out, we could see populations collapse faster than they could recover.

08:12.400 --> 08:18.400
On Earth, other species would move in to fill the void, but our Martian biosphere is not as flexible.

08:18.400 --> 08:24.400
It takes hundreds, if not thousands of years before Mars becomes a stable environment.

08:24.400 --> 08:28.400
But eventually, the planet will have the potential to sustain large human colonies.

08:28.400 --> 08:35.400
With air, water, and food available, we can finally call Mars, black, blue, and green, our home.

08:35.400 --> 08:39.400
A giant volcanic island in space.

08:39.400 --> 08:41.400
Will it last, though?

08:45.400 --> 08:47.400
There is a problem we haven't addressed.

08:47.400 --> 08:54.400
Mars' core does not produce a magnetic field, so it doesn't have enough protection from solar radiation or cosmic rays.

08:54.400 --> 08:58.400
This becomes dangerous for the long-term health of Martian populations.

08:58.400 --> 09:02.400
So, as a final step, we need an artificial magnetic field.

09:02.400 --> 09:04.400
It doesn't have to be huge like Earth's.

09:04.400 --> 09:09.400
It just needs to deflect the solar wind enough so that it doesn't touch Mars.

09:09.400 --> 09:16.400
The easiest way is to construct a magnetic umbrella far ahead of Mars that splashes the solar wind to the sides.

09:16.400 --> 09:21.400
A big superconducting ring powered by nuclear facilities is all it takes.

09:21.400 --> 09:28.400
It would orbit at the Mars-Sun L1 point, keeping it constantly in between the Sun and Mars and protect the new atmosphere.

09:28.400 --> 09:30.400
And that's it.

09:30.400 --> 09:35.400
Paraforming Mars would take some work, hefty resources, and probably a century or ten,

09:35.400 --> 09:41.400
but it would be the first time we've lived in a home designed and shaped solely by us and for us.

09:41.400 --> 09:46.400
A first step towards our future among the stars.

09:46.400 --> 09:53.400
The first step that we can already take down here on Earth is learning more about the physics and biology needed for such a project.

09:53.400 --> 09:59.400
