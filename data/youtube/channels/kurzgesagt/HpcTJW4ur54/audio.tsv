0	5400	Mars is a disappointing hellhole lacking practically everything we need to stay alive.
5400	10600	It looks like we'll only ever have small crews spend a miserable time hidden underground.
10600	14600	Except we could terraform it into a green new world.
14600	21600	But to solve the planet's problems, we first need to make it worse and turn it into oceans of lava with gigantic lasers.
21600	24600	This isn't a far-fetched science fiction tale.
24600	30400	Terraforming Mars is possible on the kind of timescale our ancestors built great monuments in.
30400	38900	If humanity solves some of its pressing problems and ventures into space to expand into the solar system, this may not be that far off.
38900	42400	Okay, so how do we terraform Mars quickly?
42400	44400	Well, it's complicated.
44400	56400	Mars is dry and has no soil to grow anything.
56400	61800	Its atmosphere is too thin to breathe or protect us from radiation, giving you a high risk of cancer.
61800	67400	So to turn it into a new home for humanity, we have to give it a proper atmosphere similar to Earth's.
67400	77400	It should be made of 21% oxygen, 79% nitrogen, and a tiny bit of CO2 at an average temperature of 14 degrees Celsius and under one bar of pressure.
77400	83400	We have to create oceans and rivers, and then the ground has to be weathered into fertile soil to host living things.
83400	91400	Then we need to install a biosphere on the surface and prevent it all from being undone by installing protective measures that can stand the test of time.
91400	96400	It is difficult, but a big laser makes it a lot easier.
96400	99400	Challenge one, the atmosphere.
99400	106400	Some 4 billion years ago, Mars had a nice oxygen-rich atmosphere and was home to vast oceans and rivers.
106400	111400	It held onto it for several hundred million years before it got blown away.
111400	117400	Ultraviolet rays broke down the atmospheric gases and then the oceans until they were swept away by solar wind.
117400	121400	Today, Mars is a dry, barren wasteland.
121400	129400	Luckily, a sizable portion of the water is frozen in deep reservoirs and in the polar ice caps, enough to create a very shallow ocean.
129400	140400	And enormous amounts of oxygen are bound as minerals in the Martian rocks, like the oxygen in the iron oxides that give the planet its rust red color, as well as carbon dioxide in carbonates.
140400	148400	To free these gases, we need to reverse the reactions that lock them away by using thermolysis, which occurs at temperatures as high as on the surface of the sun.
148400	152400	In short, we want to melt the surface of Mars.
152400	157400	The best way to do that would be to put lasers in orbit, aiming their beams down on Mars.
157400	164400	The most powerful laser today is the ELI-NP, able to produce beams of 10 petawatts of power for a trillionth of a second.
164400	169400	To melt Mars, we need a laser twice as powerful that runs continuously.
169400	174400	The easiest way is to use a solar-pumped laser that can be powered directly with sunlight.
174400	180400	At its core are metal-infused glass rods that absorb energy and release it as a laser beam.
180400	188400	If we build an array of mirrors in space about 11 times the size of the United States, we can focus enough sunlight onto them to melt Mars.
188400	190400	Let's do it.
190400	198400	As the lasers hit the surface, about 750 kilograms of oxygen and some carbon dioxide emerge from every cubic meter of rock melted.
198400	204400	If we are efficient, our lasers only need to melt through the top 8 meters of the surface to get enough oxygen.
204400	206400	It would look terrifying.
206400	212400	The skies would be shrouded in storms, while the ground would glow red-hot, criss-crossed by currents of lava.
212400	217400	Tireless laser beams sweep over the landscape, leaving trails too bright to look at.
217400	220400	After they pass, the ground cools quickly.
221400	228400	A strange snow falls, the ashes from all the elements that solidify as they cool down like silicon and iron.
228400	231400	Mars is still a cold planet at this point.
231400	242400	A happy side effect of this inferno is that all the water in the polar ice caps and even deep underground rises into the sky as hot steam, forming clouds that rain down over the entire planet.
242400	249400	They would wash out the nastier gases from the atmosphere like chlorine and carry away harmful elements that accumulated on the surface.
249400	253400	In the end, they would form shallow oceans, saltier than on Earth.
253400	256400	We might need to do an extra cleanup afterwards.
256400	261400	It would take about 50 years of continuous lasering to create our oxygen atmosphere.
261400	272400	We could use this opportunity to dig deeper in some places to create the basins for salty oceans or rivers and spare some landmark features like Olympus Mons and Valles Marineris.
272400	274400	We're not done though.
274400	279400	The resulting atmosphere is nearly 100% oxygen and only 0.2 bar.
279400	282400	It's hard to breathe and very flammable.
282400	288400	To make it similar to Earth and a lot safer, we need to add a lot of nitrogen, which Mars is sadly lacking.
288400	290400	We have to import it.
290400	297400	The ideal source is Titan, a large moon of Saturn, covered in a thick atmosphere that's almost entirely nitrogen.
297400	302400	We just have to move 3,000 trillion tons from the outer solar system to Mars.
302400	305400	While that's not easy, it is doable.
305400	315400	To process that much of Titan's atmosphere, we have to construct giant automated factories on its surface powered by our lasers to suck in the atmosphere and compress it into a liquid.
315400	322400	This gets pumped into bullet-shaped tanks, which a mass driver shoots all the way to the Red Planet where they explode and mix with the oxygen.
322400	327400	We've already been able to send individual missions to Saturn in just a few years.
327400	332400	With enough resources, it should be possible to complete the task within two generations.
332400	338400	Of course, it would be much more convenient to have nitrogen left over from terraforming Venus on the side.
338400	341400	We explained this in detail in another video.
341400	348400	So, about a century after the start of the terraforming process, we have a breathable atmosphere that has the right gases.
348400	354400	If the liberated CO2 isn't enough to warm it up to temperatures we can stand, we just add some super greenhouse gases.
354400	363400	Mars at this point resembles a black marble from all the cooling lava, spotted with growing oceans and red patches where the old surface remains untouched.
363400	367400	It's still a wasteland, no better than a desert on Earth.
367400	369400	We need to fill it with life.
373400	376400	Installing a biosphere on a new planet is very difficult.
376400	383400	Unexpected interactions between species or sudden diseases can destabilize it to the point of collapse.
383400	387400	We would probably begin by seeding our young oceans with phytoplankton.
387400	393400	Without competition, it would bloom rapidly, filling up the oceans to become the bottom of an aquatic food chain.
393400	399400	They can be followed by tiny zooplankton, then by fish, maybe even sharks and whales.
399400	403400	If things go well, life in the oceans will thrive.
403400	405400	Life on land is harder.
405400	409400	Plants need nutrient-filled ground to sink their roots into.
409400	413400	But most of the surface is the congealed remains of lava and ash.
413400	420400	We could wait for thousands of years for water and wind to grind it down into finer sands, or try to do it manually.
420400	423400	But we want to be quick, and we have a big laser.
423400	431400	Turning the beam on and off in rapid succession would cause the ground to quickly heat up and contract, which breaks it into smaller and smaller pieces.
431400	435400	Add a bit of water and you get a sort of dark mud.
435400	439400	Into this mud, we can mix fungi and nitrogen-fixing bacteria.
439400	445400	They're able to absorb nitrogen and convert it into nitrate compounds to feed plants.
445400	452400	The first plants we want to bring are native to volcanic islands on Earth, since they're perfectly suited to the laser-blasted Martian landscape.
452400	457400	Eventually, the enriched mud becomes the foundation for grasslands and forests.
457400	462400	In Mars' lower gravity, trees can become very tall very fast.
462400	470400	Their roots gather the nutrients they need and then dig deeper to turn more rocks into soil, forming a self-sustaining ecosystem.
470400	475400	At this point, we can slowly introduce more plant varieties, insects, and animals.
475400	477400	Not mosquitoes, though.
477400	482400	The new biosphere needs to be maintained to prevent it from falling out of balance.
482400	487400	If plants grow too quickly and absorb too much carbon dioxide, the planet cools down too much.
487400	492400	If key species die out, we could see populations collapse faster than they could recover.
492400	498400	On Earth, other species would move in to fill the void, but our Martian biosphere is not as flexible.
498400	504400	It takes hundreds, if not thousands of years before Mars becomes a stable environment.
504400	508400	But eventually, the planet will have the potential to sustain large human colonies.
508400	515400	With air, water, and food available, we can finally call Mars, black, blue, and green, our home.
515400	519400	A giant volcanic island in space.
519400	521400	Will it last, though?
525400	527400	There is a problem we haven't addressed.
527400	534400	Mars' core does not produce a magnetic field, so it doesn't have enough protection from solar radiation or cosmic rays.
534400	538400	This becomes dangerous for the long-term health of Martian populations.
538400	542400	So, as a final step, we need an artificial magnetic field.
542400	544400	It doesn't have to be huge like Earth's.
544400	549400	It just needs to deflect the solar wind enough so that it doesn't touch Mars.
549400	556400	The easiest way is to construct a magnetic umbrella far ahead of Mars that splashes the solar wind to the sides.
556400	561400	A big superconducting ring powered by nuclear facilities is all it takes.
561400	568400	It would orbit at the Mars-Sun L1 point, keeping it constantly in between the Sun and Mars and protect the new atmosphere.
568400	570400	And that's it.
570400	575400	Paraforming Mars would take some work, hefty resources, and probably a century or ten,
575400	581400	but it would be the first time we've lived in a home designed and shaped solely by us and for us.
581400	586400	A first step towards our future among the stars.
586400	593400	The first step that we can already take down here on Earth is learning more about the physics and biology needed for such a project.
