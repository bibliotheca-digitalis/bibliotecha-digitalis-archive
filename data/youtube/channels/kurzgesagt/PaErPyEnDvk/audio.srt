1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,480
Sometimes, the world feels, hmm, boring.

2
00:00:05,480 --> 00:00:12,520
We visited all the remote islands, conquered the Arctic, and penetrated the deepest jungles.

3
00:00:12,520 --> 00:00:16,160
But there is still one place to explore.

4
00:00:16,160 --> 00:00:23,600
It's a wet and deadly desert inhabited by mysterious creatures living in total darkness.

5
00:00:23,600 --> 00:00:25,480
The deep sea.

6
00:00:25,480 --> 00:00:37,120
Let's dive down.

7
00:00:37,120 --> 00:00:41,660
When we look at the sheer scale of the Earth's oceans, it's hard to believe that less than

8
00:00:41,660 --> 00:00:45,680
2% of all biomass on Earth lives here.

9
00:00:45,680 --> 00:00:51,600
And of that small percentage, around 90% is located close to the surface in the first

10
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:53,760
200 meters.

11
00:00:53,760 --> 00:00:56,200
This is where we begin our journey.

12
00:00:56,200 --> 00:01:01,800
Here, light can still penetrate the water, which allows photosynthesis to occur.

13
00:01:01,800 --> 00:01:06,800
Phytoplankton, trillions and trillions of single-celled algae and bacteria, make up

14
00:01:06,800 --> 00:01:11,880
the foundation of the ocean's ecosystem, and they're consumed by bigger plankton, who

15
00:01:11,880 --> 00:01:15,400
are consumed by other species.

16
00:01:15,400 --> 00:01:20,120
The seafloor at this depth is akin to the Amazon rainforest, and is often covered with

17
00:01:20,120 --> 00:01:26,520
coral reefs, algae, and other sea plants that are home to a plethora of sea animals.

18
00:01:26,520 --> 00:01:30,960
So far, we've focused most of our attention on this comparatively pleasant environment,

19
00:01:30,960 --> 00:01:35,800
where we fish, swim, pollute, and do science.

20
00:01:35,800 --> 00:01:38,960
So let's dive deeper.

21
00:01:38,960 --> 00:01:43,680
Moving from familiar coastal waters into deeper, more remote waters, we eventually reach the

22
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:48,160
edge of the continental shelf, where we're confronted with the continental slope, the

23
00:01:48,160 --> 00:01:51,440
long descent down to the deep sea.

24
00:01:51,440 --> 00:01:56,920
With every additional meter of water, light fades drastically, which means there are basically

25
00:01:56,920 --> 00:02:02,440
no more plants, and the seemingly steep continental slope begins to remind us of the surface of

26
00:02:02,440 --> 00:02:04,080
the moon.

27
00:02:04,080 --> 00:02:08,580
Looking out, we're faced by what seems to be endless open water.

28
00:02:08,580 --> 00:02:12,900
Let's leave the slope behind us, and enter what's known as the twilight zone, the portal

29
00:02:12,900 --> 00:02:14,800
to the deep sea.

30
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:19,860
As we sink down further, the water pressure rises to deadly levels.

31
00:02:19,860 --> 00:02:23,720
The deepest scuba dive ever came in at 332 meters.

32
00:02:23,720 --> 00:02:29,640
At that depth, the pressure is like having 200 cars stacked on top of you.

33
00:02:29,640 --> 00:02:34,040
Yet we've only completed 3% of our journey.

34
00:02:34,040 --> 00:02:38,880
While this region seems pretty grim, many fish and other animals actually spend at least

35
00:02:38,880 --> 00:02:41,360
half their lives down here.

36
00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:45,460
During the day, it's a good place to rest and recover, hidden from predators in the

37
00:02:45,460 --> 00:02:47,860
vast dark waters.

38
00:02:47,860 --> 00:02:53,000
At night, they can travel more safely into shallower zones to feed in the food-rich surface

39
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:54,600
waters.

40
00:02:54,600 --> 00:03:01,340
In this transition zone between twilight and darkness, light becomes a powerful tool.

41
00:03:01,340 --> 00:03:06,720
Over 90% of the species indigenous to this deep environment use bioluminescence chemicals

42
00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:08,900
to create light.

43
00:03:08,900 --> 00:03:13,820
They do so as camouflage against the very faint sunlight to send signals to potential

44
00:03:13,820 --> 00:03:17,020
mates or to confuse and scare attackers.

45
00:03:17,020 --> 00:03:20,780
Or, they use light to hunt.

46
00:03:20,780 --> 00:03:24,260
Another tool for survival in the dark is teamwork.

47
00:03:24,260 --> 00:03:29,400
At around 700 meters, we encounter a colony of siphonophores.

48
00:03:29,400 --> 00:03:34,340
They can be up to 50 meters in length, but are only as wide as a broomstick.

49
00:03:34,340 --> 00:03:40,860
To attract prey, a colony creates a tragically beautiful bright blue or red light and deploys

50
00:03:40,860 --> 00:03:48,080
a curtain of tentacles filled with toxic needles that kill anything that comes too close.

51
00:03:48,080 --> 00:03:54,100
But most species living down here have to rely on an unlikely resource, marine snow.

52
00:03:54,100 --> 00:03:59,900
White, flaky stuff that constantly sinks from the surface to the bottom of the ocean.

53
00:03:59,900 --> 00:04:06,740
It consists of dead plant or animal parts, fecal matter, shells, sand, or dust.

54
00:04:06,740 --> 00:04:11,520
Even though this doesn't sound very tasty, without this crucial resource, life in the

55
00:04:11,520 --> 00:04:14,160
deep sea would starve.

56
00:04:14,160 --> 00:04:18,480
It's in this area that the most fascinating battles between two unlikely enemies could

57
00:04:18,480 --> 00:04:19,880
happen.

58
00:04:19,880 --> 00:04:24,760
Sperm whales hunt and attack giant squid the size of a house.

59
00:04:24,760 --> 00:04:29,120
While the squid fight back ferociously, they probably don't stand a chance, but they

60
00:04:29,120 --> 00:04:33,160
do leave permanent marks on their killer's skin.

61
00:04:33,160 --> 00:04:39,560
As we reach 1000 meters, deeper than the tallest structure built by humans, we need to be careful.

62
00:04:39,560 --> 00:04:44,000
This is the Midnight Zone, a place of utter darkness.

63
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:50,480
A barely explored wet wasteland consisting of nothing but endless black open water.

64
00:04:50,480 --> 00:04:57,320
At these depths, it's harder for a human to take a swim than to take a walk in space.

65
00:04:57,440 --> 00:05:04,000
Eating food down here is really hard, so life had to adapt and become extremely energy efficient.

66
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:08,880
Like the 30 centimeter long vampire squid that floats through the water without motion,

67
00:05:08,880 --> 00:05:11,720
with long and slender catching arms extended.

68
00:05:11,720 --> 00:05:17,160
They're covered in tiny stiff hairs, which brush food from the water.

69
00:05:17,160 --> 00:05:22,320
This saves a lot of energy compared to actively catching food.

70
00:05:22,320 --> 00:05:27,200
For carnivorous fish, it's much harder to find food, since living prey is quite rare

71
00:05:27,200 --> 00:05:29,100
down here.

72
00:05:29,100 --> 00:05:33,360
So the hunters have to get a perfect grip on their victim on first strike, otherwise

73
00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:36,160
it will escape into the dark.

74
00:05:36,160 --> 00:05:40,840
Many deep sea predators have several sets of long and deadly teeth.

75
00:05:40,840 --> 00:05:47,200
Like the viper fish, which uses its long fangs to trap even large prey and swallow it whole.

76
00:05:47,200 --> 00:05:52,400
Or the frilled shark with its impressive set of 300 teeth, which are curved backwards

77
00:05:52,400 --> 00:05:55,560
to hook their victims in their mouths.

78
00:05:55,560 --> 00:06:02,500
We sink further, below the 3800 mark, as deep as the grave of the Titanic.

79
00:06:02,500 --> 00:06:05,480
We are now at abyssal depths.

80
00:06:05,480 --> 00:06:09,240
Here, life happens in slow motion.

81
00:06:09,240 --> 00:06:14,560
Preserving every last bit of energy is crucial for survival.

82
00:06:14,560 --> 00:06:20,960
Living down here hovers motionless, or swims in a slow, elegant fashion.

83
00:06:20,960 --> 00:06:27,720
The only time the animals living in this zone move fast is when they have to escape danger.

84
00:06:27,720 --> 00:06:32,720
Like the dumbo octopod, paddling with its eel-like fins, or the grenadiers fish with

85
00:06:32,720 --> 00:06:36,040
its slow eel-like tailbeats.

86
00:06:36,040 --> 00:06:41,300
At 4000 meters, we finally reach ground again, the abyssal plain.

87
00:06:41,300 --> 00:06:45,840
It's covered in grey mud and rocks, dusted with the remains of marine snow, which is

88
00:06:45,840 --> 00:06:52,000
consumed by animals like sea cucumbers, shrimp, sea urchins, and sea worms.

89
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:57,260
In some regions of the seafloor, small dark mineral deposits can be seen.

90
00:06:57,260 --> 00:07:00,260
These are manganese nodules.

91
00:07:00,260 --> 00:07:05,740
Deep sea corals and sponges use them to anchor themselves on the bottom of the sea.

92
00:07:05,740 --> 00:07:11,100
Though life is sparse on the deep seafloor, even down here there are oases.

93
00:07:11,100 --> 00:07:16,180
In the rift valleys, where tectonic plates are splitting apart, magma heats up seawater

94
00:07:16,180 --> 00:07:21,940
and creates dark jets of water and minerals as hot as 400 degrees Celsius that form elaborate

95
00:07:21,940 --> 00:07:24,740
chimneys and towers.

96
00:07:24,740 --> 00:07:29,380
Extremophile bacteria use the minerals to create organic substances that are the basis

97
00:07:29,380 --> 00:07:32,320
for unique ecosystems.

98
00:07:32,320 --> 00:07:38,780
As we descend further, we reach the deepest point of the abyssal plain at 6000 meters.

99
00:07:38,780 --> 00:07:42,160
For most of the seafloor, this is as deep as it gets.

100
00:07:42,160 --> 00:07:46,540
But if we want to get to the deepest point of the oceans, we're actually only halfway

101
00:07:46,540 --> 00:07:47,540
there.

102
00:07:47,540 --> 00:07:52,540
Let's enter the hadal zone, the underworld of the sea.

103
00:07:52,540 --> 00:07:58,860
It consists of long, narrow trenches that only make up around 0.25% of the oceans and

104
00:07:58,860 --> 00:08:02,620
are among the most extreme environments on Earth.

105
00:08:02,620 --> 00:08:07,940
Only extremophiles exist down here, like the ethereal snailfish that holds the record for

106
00:08:07,940 --> 00:08:13,080
the deepest living fish ever seen at around 8000 meters.

107
00:08:13,080 --> 00:08:19,220
We see spiky and sharp black rocks rush by as we sink down to more than 10,000.

108
00:08:19,220 --> 00:08:25,280
Until we reach the final slope, a trench inside the larger Mariana Trench with gently sloping

109
00:08:25,280 --> 00:08:30,760
sides that enframe a valley about 1.6 kilometers wide.

110
00:08:30,760 --> 00:08:38,960
This is it, the deepest point, the Challenger Deep, 11,000 meters below the surface.

111
00:08:38,960 --> 00:08:43,920
The water pressure here is 1086 bar.

112
00:08:43,920 --> 00:08:49,360
Taking a swim here is like having to balance 1800 elephants on top of you.

113
00:08:49,360 --> 00:08:53,460
But even here, life has found a way to thrive.

114
00:08:53,460 --> 00:08:58,880
Next to sea cucumbers, white and light pink amphipods wiggle their way through the water.

115
00:08:58,880 --> 00:09:01,460
Their size is astounding.

116
00:09:01,460 --> 00:09:05,720
While their shallow water cousins are mainly a few centimeters long, the deep sea version

117
00:09:05,720 --> 00:09:09,360
can reach up to 30 centimeters.

118
00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:13,520
And there are other things floating elegantly through the water.

119
00:09:13,520 --> 00:09:18,200
Plastic bags that were found by scientists in 2018.

120
00:09:18,200 --> 00:09:23,920
Even the remotest place on Earth is not safe from human influence.

121
00:09:23,960 --> 00:09:29,280
There's nothing left to do now, and our oxygen is running out, so we begin our ascent.

122
00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:45,020
After hours of traveling through dark nothingness, we finally see a glimpse of light.

123
00:09:45,020 --> 00:09:48,560
We arrive back at a calm surface.

124
00:09:48,560 --> 00:09:51,200
The oceans are so deep.

125
00:09:51,200 --> 00:09:53,900
There is so much of them.

126
00:09:53,900 --> 00:10:00,100
We owe it to ourselves and to our descendants to preserve them as well as we can.

127
00:10:00,100 --> 00:10:05,020
There are still so many wondrous things left to be discovered.

128
00:10:05,020 --> 00:10:12,380
So, you're all tingly now and want to go exploring?

129
00:10:12,380 --> 00:10:15,000
Why not start off with some juicy science?

130
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:20,140
You can use our friends from Brilliant as your springboard for a knowledge deep dive.

131
00:10:20,460 --> 00:10:24,340
Brilliant is a website that helps you approach science in a practical way, through interactive

132
00:10:24,340 --> 00:10:29,580
courses and daily problems in maths, science, and computer science.

133
00:10:29,580 --> 00:10:33,800
Instead of simply flooding you with information, you get the tools you need to untangle complex

134
00:10:33,800 --> 00:10:36,000
topics by yourself.

135
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:39,140
It's hands-on learning instead of chalk and talk.

136
00:10:39,140 --> 00:10:43,900
Plunge in and get to the bottom of courses about things like geometry, waves and light,

137
00:10:43,900 --> 00:10:46,500
gravitational physics, and many more.

145
00:11:12,820 --> 00:11:14,660
Do you need more vitamin C?

146
00:11:14,660 --> 00:11:18,180
We've also made an epic poster featuring some of the most fascinating creatures we

147
00:11:18,180 --> 00:11:20,540
encountered on our dive.

148
00:11:20,540 --> 00:11:24,700
It's much less work than an aquarium, but just as soothing and pretty.
