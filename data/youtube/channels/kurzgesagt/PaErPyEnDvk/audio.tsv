0	5480	Sometimes, the world feels, hmm, boring.
5480	12520	We visited all the remote islands, conquered the Arctic, and penetrated the deepest jungles.
12520	16160	But there is still one place to explore.
16160	23600	It's a wet and deadly desert inhabited by mysterious creatures living in total darkness.
23600	25480	The deep sea.
25480	37120	Let's dive down.
37120	41660	When we look at the sheer scale of the Earth's oceans, it's hard to believe that less than
41660	45680	2% of all biomass on Earth lives here.
45680	51600	And of that small percentage, around 90% is located close to the surface in the first
51600	53760	200 meters.
53760	56200	This is where we begin our journey.
56200	61800	Here, light can still penetrate the water, which allows photosynthesis to occur.
61800	66800	Phytoplankton, trillions and trillions of single-celled algae and bacteria, make up
66800	71880	the foundation of the ocean's ecosystem, and they're consumed by bigger plankton, who
71880	75400	are consumed by other species.
75400	80120	The seafloor at this depth is akin to the Amazon rainforest, and is often covered with
80120	86520	coral reefs, algae, and other sea plants that are home to a plethora of sea animals.
86520	90960	So far, we've focused most of our attention on this comparatively pleasant environment,
90960	95800	where we fish, swim, pollute, and do science.
95800	98960	So let's dive deeper.
98960	103680	Moving from familiar coastal waters into deeper, more remote waters, we eventually reach the
103680	108160	edge of the continental shelf, where we're confronted with the continental slope, the
108160	111440	long descent down to the deep sea.
111440	116920	With every additional meter of water, light fades drastically, which means there are basically
116920	122440	no more plants, and the seemingly steep continental slope begins to remind us of the surface of
122440	124080	the moon.
124080	128580	Looking out, we're faced by what seems to be endless open water.
128580	132900	Let's leave the slope behind us, and enter what's known as the twilight zone, the portal
132900	134800	to the deep sea.
134800	139860	As we sink down further, the water pressure rises to deadly levels.
139860	143720	The deepest scuba dive ever came in at 332 meters.
143720	149640	At that depth, the pressure is like having 200 cars stacked on top of you.
149640	154040	Yet we've only completed 3% of our journey.
154040	158880	While this region seems pretty grim, many fish and other animals actually spend at least
158880	161360	half their lives down here.
161360	165460	During the day, it's a good place to rest and recover, hidden from predators in the
165460	167860	vast dark waters.
167860	173000	At night, they can travel more safely into shallower zones to feed in the food-rich surface
173000	174600	waters.
174600	181340	In this transition zone between twilight and darkness, light becomes a powerful tool.
181340	186720	Over 90% of the species indigenous to this deep environment use bioluminescence chemicals
186720	188900	to create light.
188900	193820	They do so as camouflage against the very faint sunlight to send signals to potential
193820	197020	mates or to confuse and scare attackers.
197020	200780	Or, they use light to hunt.
200780	204260	Another tool for survival in the dark is teamwork.
204260	209400	At around 700 meters, we encounter a colony of siphonophores.
209400	214340	They can be up to 50 meters in length, but are only as wide as a broomstick.
214340	220860	To attract prey, a colony creates a tragically beautiful bright blue or red light and deploys
220860	228080	a curtain of tentacles filled with toxic needles that kill anything that comes too close.
228080	234100	But most species living down here have to rely on an unlikely resource, marine snow.
234100	239900	White, flaky stuff that constantly sinks from the surface to the bottom of the ocean.
239900	246740	It consists of dead plant or animal parts, fecal matter, shells, sand, or dust.
246740	251520	Even though this doesn't sound very tasty, without this crucial resource, life in the
251520	254160	deep sea would starve.
254160	258480	It's in this area that the most fascinating battles between two unlikely enemies could
258480	259880	happen.
259880	264760	Sperm whales hunt and attack giant squid the size of a house.
264760	269120	While the squid fight back ferociously, they probably don't stand a chance, but they
269120	273160	do leave permanent marks on their killer's skin.
273160	279560	As we reach 1000 meters, deeper than the tallest structure built by humans, we need to be careful.
279560	284000	This is the Midnight Zone, a place of utter darkness.
284000	290480	A barely explored wet wasteland consisting of nothing but endless black open water.
290480	297320	At these depths, it's harder for a human to take a swim than to take a walk in space.
297440	304000	Eating food down here is really hard, so life had to adapt and become extremely energy efficient.
304000	308880	Like the 30 centimeter long vampire squid that floats through the water without motion,
308880	311720	with long and slender catching arms extended.
311720	317160	They're covered in tiny stiff hairs, which brush food from the water.
317160	322320	This saves a lot of energy compared to actively catching food.
322320	327200	For carnivorous fish, it's much harder to find food, since living prey is quite rare
327200	329100	down here.
329100	333360	So the hunters have to get a perfect grip on their victim on first strike, otherwise
333360	336160	it will escape into the dark.
336160	340840	Many deep sea predators have several sets of long and deadly teeth.
340840	347200	Like the viper fish, which uses its long fangs to trap even large prey and swallow it whole.
347200	352400	Or the frilled shark with its impressive set of 300 teeth, which are curved backwards
352400	355560	to hook their victims in their mouths.
355560	362500	We sink further, below the 3800 mark, as deep as the grave of the Titanic.
362500	365480	We are now at abyssal depths.
365480	369240	Here, life happens in slow motion.
369240	374560	Preserving every last bit of energy is crucial for survival.
374560	380960	Living down here hovers motionless, or swims in a slow, elegant fashion.
380960	387720	The only time the animals living in this zone move fast is when they have to escape danger.
387720	392720	Like the dumbo octopod, paddling with its eel-like fins, or the grenadiers fish with
392720	396040	its slow eel-like tailbeats.
396040	401300	At 4000 meters, we finally reach ground again, the abyssal plain.
401300	405840	It's covered in grey mud and rocks, dusted with the remains of marine snow, which is
405840	412000	consumed by animals like sea cucumbers, shrimp, sea urchins, and sea worms.
412000	417260	In some regions of the seafloor, small dark mineral deposits can be seen.
417260	420260	These are manganese nodules.
420260	425740	Deep sea corals and sponges use them to anchor themselves on the bottom of the sea.
425740	431100	Though life is sparse on the deep seafloor, even down here there are oases.
431100	436180	In the rift valleys, where tectonic plates are splitting apart, magma heats up seawater
436180	441940	and creates dark jets of water and minerals as hot as 400 degrees Celsius that form elaborate
441940	444740	chimneys and towers.
444740	449380	Extremophile bacteria use the minerals to create organic substances that are the basis
449380	452320	for unique ecosystems.
452320	458780	As we descend further, we reach the deepest point of the abyssal plain at 6000 meters.
458780	462160	For most of the seafloor, this is as deep as it gets.
462160	466540	But if we want to get to the deepest point of the oceans, we're actually only halfway
466540	467540	there.
467540	472540	Let's enter the hadal zone, the underworld of the sea.
472540	478860	It consists of long, narrow trenches that only make up around 0.25% of the oceans and
478860	482620	are among the most extreme environments on Earth.
482620	487940	Only extremophiles exist down here, like the ethereal snailfish that holds the record for
487940	493080	the deepest living fish ever seen at around 8000 meters.
493080	499220	We see spiky and sharp black rocks rush by as we sink down to more than 10,000.
499220	505280	Until we reach the final slope, a trench inside the larger Mariana Trench with gently sloping
505280	510760	sides that enframe a valley about 1.6 kilometers wide.
510760	518960	This is it, the deepest point, the Challenger Deep, 11,000 meters below the surface.
518960	523920	The water pressure here is 1086 bar.
523920	529360	Taking a swim here is like having to balance 1800 elephants on top of you.
529360	533460	But even here, life has found a way to thrive.
533460	538880	Next to sea cucumbers, white and light pink amphipods wiggle their way through the water.
538880	541460	Their size is astounding.
541460	545720	While their shallow water cousins are mainly a few centimeters long, the deep sea version
545720	549360	can reach up to 30 centimeters.
549360	553520	And there are other things floating elegantly through the water.
553520	558200	Plastic bags that were found by scientists in 2018.
558200	563920	Even the remotest place on Earth is not safe from human influence.
563960	569280	There's nothing left to do now, and our oxygen is running out, so we begin our ascent.
579600	585020	After hours of traveling through dark nothingness, we finally see a glimpse of light.
585020	588560	We arrive back at a calm surface.
588560	591200	The oceans are so deep.
591200	593900	There is so much of them.
593900	600100	We owe it to ourselves and to our descendants to preserve them as well as we can.
600100	605020	There are still so many wondrous things left to be discovered.
605020	612380	So, you're all tingly now and want to go exploring?
