00:00.000 --> 00:05.480
Sometimes, the world feels, hmm, boring.

00:05.480 --> 00:12.520
We visited all the remote islands, conquered the Arctic, and penetrated the deepest jungles.

00:12.520 --> 00:16.160
But there is still one place to explore.

00:16.160 --> 00:23.600
It's a wet and deadly desert inhabited by mysterious creatures living in total darkness.

00:23.600 --> 00:25.480
The deep sea.

00:25.480 --> 00:37.120
Let's dive down.

00:37.120 --> 00:41.660
When we look at the sheer scale of the Earth's oceans, it's hard to believe that less than

00:41.660 --> 00:45.680
2% of all biomass on Earth lives here.

00:45.680 --> 00:51.600
And of that small percentage, around 90% is located close to the surface in the first

00:51.600 --> 00:53.760
200 meters.

00:53.760 --> 00:56.200
This is where we begin our journey.

00:56.200 --> 01:01.800
Here, light can still penetrate the water, which allows photosynthesis to occur.

01:01.800 --> 01:06.800
Phytoplankton, trillions and trillions of single-celled algae and bacteria, make up

01:06.800 --> 01:11.880
the foundation of the ocean's ecosystem, and they're consumed by bigger plankton, who

01:11.880 --> 01:15.400
are consumed by other species.

01:15.400 --> 01:20.120
The seafloor at this depth is akin to the Amazon rainforest, and is often covered with

01:20.120 --> 01:26.520
coral reefs, algae, and other sea plants that are home to a plethora of sea animals.

01:26.520 --> 01:30.960
So far, we've focused most of our attention on this comparatively pleasant environment,

01:30.960 --> 01:35.800
where we fish, swim, pollute, and do science.

01:35.800 --> 01:38.960
So let's dive deeper.

01:38.960 --> 01:43.680
Moving from familiar coastal waters into deeper, more remote waters, we eventually reach the

01:43.680 --> 01:48.160
edge of the continental shelf, where we're confronted with the continental slope, the

01:48.160 --> 01:51.440
long descent down to the deep sea.

01:51.440 --> 01:56.920
With every additional meter of water, light fades drastically, which means there are basically

01:56.920 --> 02:02.440
no more plants, and the seemingly steep continental slope begins to remind us of the surface of

02:02.440 --> 02:04.080
the moon.

02:04.080 --> 02:08.580
Looking out, we're faced by what seems to be endless open water.

02:08.580 --> 02:12.900
Let's leave the slope behind us, and enter what's known as the twilight zone, the portal

02:12.900 --> 02:14.800
to the deep sea.

02:14.800 --> 02:19.860
As we sink down further, the water pressure rises to deadly levels.

02:19.860 --> 02:23.720
The deepest scuba dive ever came in at 332 meters.

02:23.720 --> 02:29.640
At that depth, the pressure is like having 200 cars stacked on top of you.

02:29.640 --> 02:34.040
Yet we've only completed 3% of our journey.

02:34.040 --> 02:38.880
While this region seems pretty grim, many fish and other animals actually spend at least

02:38.880 --> 02:41.360
half their lives down here.

02:41.360 --> 02:45.460
During the day, it's a good place to rest and recover, hidden from predators in the

02:45.460 --> 02:47.860
vast dark waters.

02:47.860 --> 02:53.000
At night, they can travel more safely into shallower zones to feed in the food-rich surface

02:53.000 --> 02:54.600
waters.

02:54.600 --> 03:01.340
In this transition zone between twilight and darkness, light becomes a powerful tool.

03:01.340 --> 03:06.720
Over 90% of the species indigenous to this deep environment use bioluminescence chemicals

03:06.720 --> 03:08.900
to create light.

03:08.900 --> 03:13.820
They do so as camouflage against the very faint sunlight to send signals to potential

03:13.820 --> 03:17.020
mates or to confuse and scare attackers.

03:17.020 --> 03:20.780
Or, they use light to hunt.

03:20.780 --> 03:24.260
Another tool for survival in the dark is teamwork.

03:24.260 --> 03:29.400
At around 700 meters, we encounter a colony of siphonophores.

03:29.400 --> 03:34.340
They can be up to 50 meters in length, but are only as wide as a broomstick.

03:34.340 --> 03:40.860
To attract prey, a colony creates a tragically beautiful bright blue or red light and deploys

03:40.860 --> 03:48.080
a curtain of tentacles filled with toxic needles that kill anything that comes too close.

03:48.080 --> 03:54.100
But most species living down here have to rely on an unlikely resource, marine snow.

03:54.100 --> 03:59.900
White, flaky stuff that constantly sinks from the surface to the bottom of the ocean.

03:59.900 --> 04:06.740
It consists of dead plant or animal parts, fecal matter, shells, sand, or dust.

04:06.740 --> 04:11.520
Even though this doesn't sound very tasty, without this crucial resource, life in the

04:11.520 --> 04:14.160
deep sea would starve.

04:14.160 --> 04:18.480
It's in this area that the most fascinating battles between two unlikely enemies could

04:18.480 --> 04:19.880
happen.

04:19.880 --> 04:24.760
Sperm whales hunt and attack giant squid the size of a house.

04:24.760 --> 04:29.120
While the squid fight back ferociously, they probably don't stand a chance, but they

04:29.120 --> 04:33.160
do leave permanent marks on their killer's skin.

04:33.160 --> 04:39.560
As we reach 1000 meters, deeper than the tallest structure built by humans, we need to be careful.

04:39.560 --> 04:44.000
This is the Midnight Zone, a place of utter darkness.

04:44.000 --> 04:50.480
A barely explored wet wasteland consisting of nothing but endless black open water.

04:50.480 --> 04:57.320
At these depths, it's harder for a human to take a swim than to take a walk in space.

04:57.440 --> 05:04.000
Eating food down here is really hard, so life had to adapt and become extremely energy efficient.

05:04.000 --> 05:08.880
Like the 30 centimeter long vampire squid that floats through the water without motion,

05:08.880 --> 05:11.720
with long and slender catching arms extended.

05:11.720 --> 05:17.160
They're covered in tiny stiff hairs, which brush food from the water.

05:17.160 --> 05:22.320
This saves a lot of energy compared to actively catching food.

05:22.320 --> 05:27.200
For carnivorous fish, it's much harder to find food, since living prey is quite rare

05:27.200 --> 05:29.100
down here.

05:29.100 --> 05:33.360
So the hunters have to get a perfect grip on their victim on first strike, otherwise

05:33.360 --> 05:36.160
it will escape into the dark.

05:36.160 --> 05:40.840
Many deep sea predators have several sets of long and deadly teeth.

05:40.840 --> 05:47.200
Like the viper fish, which uses its long fangs to trap even large prey and swallow it whole.

05:47.200 --> 05:52.400
Or the frilled shark with its impressive set of 300 teeth, which are curved backwards

05:52.400 --> 05:55.560
to hook their victims in their mouths.

05:55.560 --> 06:02.500
We sink further, below the 3800 mark, as deep as the grave of the Titanic.

06:02.500 --> 06:05.480
We are now at abyssal depths.

06:05.480 --> 06:09.240
Here, life happens in slow motion.

06:09.240 --> 06:14.560
Preserving every last bit of energy is crucial for survival.

06:14.560 --> 06:20.960
Living down here hovers motionless, or swims in a slow, elegant fashion.

06:20.960 --> 06:27.720
The only time the animals living in this zone move fast is when they have to escape danger.

06:27.720 --> 06:32.720
Like the dumbo octopod, paddling with its eel-like fins, or the grenadiers fish with

06:32.720 --> 06:36.040
its slow eel-like tailbeats.

06:36.040 --> 06:41.300
At 4000 meters, we finally reach ground again, the abyssal plain.

06:41.300 --> 06:45.840
It's covered in grey mud and rocks, dusted with the remains of marine snow, which is

06:45.840 --> 06:52.000
consumed by animals like sea cucumbers, shrimp, sea urchins, and sea worms.

06:52.000 --> 06:57.260
In some regions of the seafloor, small dark mineral deposits can be seen.

06:57.260 --> 07:00.260
These are manganese nodules.

07:00.260 --> 07:05.740
Deep sea corals and sponges use them to anchor themselves on the bottom of the sea.

07:05.740 --> 07:11.100
Though life is sparse on the deep seafloor, even down here there are oases.

07:11.100 --> 07:16.180
In the rift valleys, where tectonic plates are splitting apart, magma heats up seawater

07:16.180 --> 07:21.940
and creates dark jets of water and minerals as hot as 400 degrees Celsius that form elaborate

07:21.940 --> 07:24.740
chimneys and towers.

07:24.740 --> 07:29.380
Extremophile bacteria use the minerals to create organic substances that are the basis

07:29.380 --> 07:32.320
for unique ecosystems.

07:32.320 --> 07:38.780
As we descend further, we reach the deepest point of the abyssal plain at 6000 meters.

07:38.780 --> 07:42.160
For most of the seafloor, this is as deep as it gets.

07:42.160 --> 07:46.540
But if we want to get to the deepest point of the oceans, we're actually only halfway

07:46.540 --> 07:47.540
there.

07:47.540 --> 07:52.540
Let's enter the hadal zone, the underworld of the sea.

07:52.540 --> 07:58.860
It consists of long, narrow trenches that only make up around 0.25% of the oceans and

07:58.860 --> 08:02.620
are among the most extreme environments on Earth.

08:02.620 --> 08:07.940
Only extremophiles exist down here, like the ethereal snailfish that holds the record for

08:07.940 --> 08:13.080
the deepest living fish ever seen at around 8000 meters.

08:13.080 --> 08:19.220
We see spiky and sharp black rocks rush by as we sink down to more than 10,000.

08:19.220 --> 08:25.280
Until we reach the final slope, a trench inside the larger Mariana Trench with gently sloping

08:25.280 --> 08:30.760
sides that enframe a valley about 1.6 kilometers wide.

08:30.760 --> 08:38.960
This is it, the deepest point, the Challenger Deep, 11,000 meters below the surface.

08:38.960 --> 08:43.920
The water pressure here is 1086 bar.

08:43.920 --> 08:49.360
Taking a swim here is like having to balance 1800 elephants on top of you.

08:49.360 --> 08:53.460
But even here, life has found a way to thrive.

08:53.460 --> 08:58.880
Next to sea cucumbers, white and light pink amphipods wiggle their way through the water.

08:58.880 --> 09:01.460
Their size is astounding.

09:01.460 --> 09:05.720
While their shallow water cousins are mainly a few centimeters long, the deep sea version

09:05.720 --> 09:09.360
can reach up to 30 centimeters.

09:09.360 --> 09:13.520
And there are other things floating elegantly through the water.

09:13.520 --> 09:18.200
Plastic bags that were found by scientists in 2018.

09:18.200 --> 09:23.920
Even the remotest place on Earth is not safe from human influence.

09:23.960 --> 09:29.280
There's nothing left to do now, and our oxygen is running out, so we begin our ascent.

09:39.600 --> 09:45.020
After hours of traveling through dark nothingness, we finally see a glimpse of light.

09:45.020 --> 09:48.560
We arrive back at a calm surface.

09:48.560 --> 09:51.200
The oceans are so deep.

09:51.200 --> 09:53.900
There is so much of them.

09:53.900 --> 10:00.100
We owe it to ourselves and to our descendants to preserve them as well as we can.

10:00.100 --> 10:05.020
There are still so many wondrous things left to be discovered.

10:05.020 --> 10:12.380
So, you're all tingly now and want to go exploring?

10:12.380 --> 10:15.000
Why not start off with some juicy science?

10:15.000 --> 10:20.140
You can use our friends from Brilliant as your springboard for a knowledge deep dive.

Instead of simply flooding you with information, you get the tools you need to untangle complex

10:33.800 --> 10:36.000
topics by yourself.

10:36.000 --> 10:39.140
It's hands-on learning instead of chalk and talk.

10:39.140 --> 10:43.900
Plunge in and get to the bottom of courses about things like geometry, waves and light,

10:43.900 --> 10:46.500
gravitational physics, and many more.

Go ahead and take the plunge.

11:12.820 --> 11:14.660
Do you need more vitamin C?

11:14.660 --> 11:18.180
We've also made an epic poster featuring some of the most fascinating creatures we

11:18.180 --> 11:20.540
encountered on our dive.

11:20.540 --> 11:24.700
It's much less work than an aquarium, but just as soothing and pretty.
