1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:09,320
The Sun. Smooth and round and peaceful. Except when it suddenly vomits radiation and plasma

2
00:00:09,320 --> 00:00:16,500
in random directions. These solar flares and Coronal Mass Ejections, or CMEs, can hit Earth

3
00:00:16,500 --> 00:00:22,720
and have serious consequences for humanity. How exactly do they work, how bad could they

4
00:00:22,720 --> 00:00:36,400
be, and can we prepare for them? While the Sun seems pretty solid, it's actually

5
00:00:36,400 --> 00:00:42,520
like a very hot ocean. So hot that it rips atoms into electrons and nuclei, all flowing

6
00:00:42,520 --> 00:00:48,120
around each other in a plasma. This plasma is pushed around and shaped by the Sun's

7
00:00:48,120 --> 00:00:53,020
magnetic field, similar to how the Sun's gravitational field reaches out to the planets

8
00:00:53,020 --> 00:00:59,000
and shapes their orbits. But magnetism is very different from gravity. Magnetism is

9
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:05,760
one part of a dual force, electromagnetism. Electricity creates magnetic fields, and magnetic

10
00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:11,360
fields create electricity. On the Sun, the plasma, made of electrically charged protons

11
00:01:11,360 --> 00:01:16,580
and electrons, creates a magnetic field as they move, and this magnetic field then shapes

12
00:01:16,580 --> 00:01:22,400
the flow of particles. They're stuck in a dynamic feedback loop called a dynamo, which

13
00:01:22,400 --> 00:01:28,420
keeps the Sun's magnetic field alive. This magnetic field stores enormous amounts of

14
00:01:28,420 --> 00:01:33,860
energy and leaks out over the solar system. It carries with it a constant trickle of solar

15
00:01:33,860 --> 00:01:39,780
plasma like a light rain known as the solar wind, creating a sort of space weather. But

16
00:01:39,780 --> 00:01:45,120
it isn't always calm and smooth. As the Sun's plasma churns and flows around itself, its

17
00:01:45,160 --> 00:01:50,440
magnetic field gets all kinked and twisted. This creates magnetic knots that build up

18
00:01:50,440 --> 00:01:55,880
enormous amounts of energy. When the magnetic knots break, like a tangle of springs exploding

19
00:01:55,880 --> 00:02:01,840
outwards, the Sun can vomit plasma and other awful things into the solar system. These

20
00:02:01,840 --> 00:02:08,220
solar storms come in many types, like solar flares, a tidal wave of high energy radiation.

21
00:02:08,220 --> 00:02:12,080
They race through the solar system at the speed of light, sweeping up protons in the

22
00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:18,560
solar wind, accelerating them into a high-speed solar proton storm. Then there are coronal

23
00:02:18,560 --> 00:02:24,160
mass ejections, which rip millions or billions of tons of plasma from the Sun's atmosphere,

24
00:02:24,160 --> 00:02:30,080
catapulting it through the solar system at speeds of up to 9 million kilometers per hour.

25
00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:36,120
When these monsters hit us, nothing happens on Earth. While even smaller storms can damage

26
00:02:36,120 --> 00:02:40,220
satellites, affect radio communication, or will be dangerous to astronauts, for people

27
00:02:40,220 --> 00:02:45,300
on the surface, space weather is harmless. Earth's atmosphere protects us from the worst

28
00:02:45,300 --> 00:02:50,180
effects of a solar flare by absorbing the blast of X-rays high up in the atmosphere,

29
00:02:50,180 --> 00:02:56,180
well before it reaches the surface. The electrified plasma from a CME is deflected by the Earth's

30
00:02:56,180 --> 00:03:01,020
magnetic field, diverting the energy storm to the North and South Poles, where energetic

31
00:03:01,020 --> 00:03:06,300
particles fall into the atmosphere, causing the atmosphere to glow and creating beautiful

32
00:03:06,300 --> 00:03:12,940
auroras. As with any sort of weather, most of the time, things are fine. Sometimes there

33
00:03:12,940 --> 00:03:18,980
are hurricanes though, or in the case of the Sun, solar superstorms. And we know that they

34
00:03:18,980 --> 00:03:24,360
happen once or twice every century. If one were to happen today, we would first detect

35
00:03:24,360 --> 00:03:30,320
strong solar flares, a sort of flash before the much more dangerous thunder. The thunder

36
00:03:30,320 --> 00:03:36,520
is a CME, consisting of billions of tons of hot magnetic plasma that crosses the 150

37
00:03:36,520 --> 00:03:42,420
million kilometers between the Sun and Earth in less than a day. When it arrives, it causes

38
00:03:42,420 --> 00:03:47,560
a shockwave that violently compresses the Earth's magnetic field and transfers energy

39
00:03:47,560 --> 00:03:53,200
into the magnetosphere. But it can get worse. If the magnetic field of the CME is aligned

40
00:03:53,200 --> 00:03:58,220
to Earth's in just the right way, the two magnetic fields merge. As the magnetic cloud

41
00:03:58,220 --> 00:04:03,940
passes over Earth, it stretches the Earth's field into a long tail. Eventually, the energy

42
00:04:03,940 --> 00:04:09,700
stored in the tail becomes too much to contain. It snaps and explosively releases its energy

43
00:04:09,700 --> 00:04:17,380
towards Earth. A geomagnetic storm has begun. A few hundred years ago, nobody would have

44
00:04:17,380 --> 00:04:21,760
cared. This storm gushing over the Earth is not relevant for machines made out of meat

45
00:04:21,760 --> 00:04:28,200
and bones. But it's very relevant for machines made out of metal and wire. Remember the dynamo

46
00:04:28,200 --> 00:04:34,440
– magnetism creates electric currents. Earth in the 21st century is covered in millions

47
00:04:34,440 --> 00:04:39,760
of kilometers of wires transporting electricity and a complex grid of machines like transformers

48
00:04:39,760 --> 00:04:45,420
that make this transfer possible. A CME's energy can induce currents in our power grid

49
00:04:45,420 --> 00:04:50,280
that can either completely shut it down or worse, destroy the transformer stations that

50
00:04:50,280 --> 00:04:56,040
keep our grid running. This has happened already, like when the Quebec power grid failed after

51
00:04:56,040 --> 00:05:01,760
a strong solar storm in 1989. But in general, our engineers know how to deal with these

52
00:05:01,760 --> 00:05:07,440
storms and so we usually don't even notice. The last time a solar hurricane washed over

53
00:05:07,440 --> 00:05:14,200
Earth was in 1859. The Carrington event, the largest geomagnetic storms ever observed on

54
00:05:14,200 --> 00:05:20,440
Earth. Massive auroras occurred as far south as the Caribbean. In some places, they were

55
00:05:20,440 --> 00:05:26,040
so bright that people got up thinking the sun was rising. Luckily, we only had one sort

56
00:05:26,040 --> 00:05:31,640
of modern technology – telegraph systems. They failed all over the world, shocking their

57
00:05:31,640 --> 00:05:37,920
operators and chucking out sparks. Today, we have a tad more technology and our luck

58
00:05:37,920 --> 00:05:43,840
may run out soon. Another bad solar storm is bound to happen eventually. A storm as

59
00:05:43,840 --> 00:05:49,860
strong as the Carrington event missed Earth only by a small margin in 2012. Studies projected

60
00:05:49,860 --> 00:05:54,100
that it would have inflicted serious damage to electronic systems globally, costing up

61
00:05:54,100 --> 00:06:00,980
to $2.6 trillion to the US alone. The time to replace all the damaged systems was estimated

62
00:06:00,980 --> 00:06:07,780
at between 4 and 10 years. It's hard to say how bad it could have been. Experts disagreed.

63
00:06:07,780 --> 00:06:10,980
Some assumed there would just be temporary blackouts, but others worried it could be

64
00:06:10,980 --> 00:06:17,040
much worse. We won't know for sure until a big solar hurricane hits us. The probability

65
00:06:17,040 --> 00:06:22,800
of such an event is estimated to be 12% per decade. That's about a 50-50 chance of at

66
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:30,240
least one in the next 50 years. And there is more unsettling news. A 2019 paper found

67
00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:37,200
that even calm stars like our sun can create superflares every few thousand years. Eruptions

68
00:06:37,200 --> 00:06:42,320
orders of magnitude stronger than the strongest storms we have observed in the solar system.

69
00:06:42,320 --> 00:06:48,300
If such a storm hits us unprepared, the consequences could be catastrophic. It's hard to overstate

70
00:06:48,300 --> 00:06:54,280
how much we depend on electricity. It's not just the lights at home. It means no computers,

71
00:06:54,280 --> 00:07:00,000
no communication, no navigation. A sustained power outage might lead to a breakdown of

72
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:06,660
the supply chain. Water supply systems failing and hospital generators running dry. Supermarkets

73
00:07:06,660 --> 00:07:12,260
not being refilled while food rots in the fields. The lack of power might make it extremely

74
00:07:12,260 --> 00:07:19,300
hard to reboot our broken power grid, taking years or decades to restart our starving civilization.

75
00:07:19,300 --> 00:07:25,180
Okay, time to panic. As much as daily newspapers might like for solar storms to send us back

76
00:07:25,180 --> 00:07:30,760
to the Stone Age, they probably won't. Fortunately, even though solar storms aren't preventable,

77
00:07:30,760 --> 00:07:36,100
virtually all of their nasty side effects are. Scientists observing the sun have a few

78
00:07:36,100 --> 00:07:41,740
hours up to a few days to see a CME coming. And the engineers working the systems that

79
00:07:41,740 --> 00:07:47,420
keep the world running are well aware of the risks posed by solar storms. Transformers

80
00:07:47,420 --> 00:07:53,180
and substations can be taken offline. Short preventative blackouts, or in other words,

81
00:07:53,180 --> 00:07:58,740
by unplugging stuff. Engineers can open up extra lines to dissipate the extra power.

82
00:07:58,740 --> 00:08:03,660
And with investment and upgrades cheap compared to those other natural disasters require,

83
00:08:03,660 --> 00:08:08,660
we could protect the world's electric grid against even the nastiest of storms. But we

84
00:08:08,660 --> 00:08:15,500
do need to prepare. While the risk is manageable, it is real. For while our sun bathes us in

85
00:08:15,500 --> 00:08:21,580
warm and pleasant light, one day, it might send a monster our way that we better be ready

86
00:08:21,580 --> 00:08:23,640
for.

89
00:08:34,700 --> 00:08:39,060
we've made two minimal infographic posters, one about the scale of the sun and one about

90
00:08:39,060 --> 00:08:43,960
the age of the universe. Both should make you feel sufficiently tiny and help you appreciate

91
00:08:43,960 --> 00:08:49,160
your existence a bit more. But wait, there's more. We have a bunch of new stuff from the

92
00:08:49,160 --> 00:08:53,980
long requested bacteriophage infographic poster to a new optimistic nihilism poster that lets

93
00:08:53,980 --> 00:08:59,860
you enjoy some existential dread in style. Or join us in our ant obsession and get the

94
00:08:59,860 --> 00:09:04,420
new ant explorer notebook with beautiful infographics and facts about ants and gold

95
