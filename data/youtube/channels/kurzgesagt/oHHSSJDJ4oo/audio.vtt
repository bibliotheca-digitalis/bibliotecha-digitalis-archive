00:00.000 --> 00:09.320
The Sun. Smooth and round and peaceful. Except when it suddenly vomits radiation and plasma

00:09.320 --> 00:16.500
in random directions. These solar flares and Coronal Mass Ejections, or CMEs, can hit Earth

00:16.500 --> 00:22.720
and have serious consequences for humanity. How exactly do they work, how bad could they

00:22.720 --> 00:36.400
be, and can we prepare for them? While the Sun seems pretty solid, it's actually

00:36.400 --> 00:42.520
like a very hot ocean. So hot that it rips atoms into electrons and nuclei, all flowing

00:42.520 --> 00:48.120
around each other in a plasma. This plasma is pushed around and shaped by the Sun's

00:48.120 --> 00:53.020
magnetic field, similar to how the Sun's gravitational field reaches out to the planets

00:53.020 --> 00:59.000
and shapes their orbits. But magnetism is very different from gravity. Magnetism is

00:59.000 --> 01:05.760
one part of a dual force, electromagnetism. Electricity creates magnetic fields, and magnetic

01:05.760 --> 01:11.360
fields create electricity. On the Sun, the plasma, made of electrically charged protons

01:11.360 --> 01:16.580
and electrons, creates a magnetic field as they move, and this magnetic field then shapes

01:16.580 --> 01:22.400
the flow of particles. They're stuck in a dynamic feedback loop called a dynamo, which

01:22.400 --> 01:28.420
keeps the Sun's magnetic field alive. This magnetic field stores enormous amounts of

01:28.420 --> 01:33.860
energy and leaks out over the solar system. It carries with it a constant trickle of solar

01:33.860 --> 01:39.780
plasma like a light rain known as the solar wind, creating a sort of space weather. But

01:39.780 --> 01:45.120
it isn't always calm and smooth. As the Sun's plasma churns and flows around itself, its

01:45.160 --> 01:50.440
magnetic field gets all kinked and twisted. This creates magnetic knots that build up

01:50.440 --> 01:55.880
enormous amounts of energy. When the magnetic knots break, like a tangle of springs exploding

01:55.880 --> 02:01.840
outwards, the Sun can vomit plasma and other awful things into the solar system. These

02:01.840 --> 02:08.220
solar storms come in many types, like solar flares, a tidal wave of high energy radiation.

02:08.220 --> 02:12.080
They race through the solar system at the speed of light, sweeping up protons in the

02:12.080 --> 02:18.560
solar wind, accelerating them into a high-speed solar proton storm. Then there are coronal

02:18.560 --> 02:24.160
mass ejections, which rip millions or billions of tons of plasma from the Sun's atmosphere,

02:24.160 --> 02:30.080
catapulting it through the solar system at speeds of up to 9 million kilometers per hour.

02:30.080 --> 02:36.120
When these monsters hit us, nothing happens on Earth. While even smaller storms can damage

02:36.120 --> 02:40.220
satellites, affect radio communication, or will be dangerous to astronauts, for people

02:40.220 --> 02:45.300
on the surface, space weather is harmless. Earth's atmosphere protects us from the worst

02:45.300 --> 02:50.180
effects of a solar flare by absorbing the blast of X-rays high up in the atmosphere,

02:50.180 --> 02:56.180
well before it reaches the surface. The electrified plasma from a CME is deflected by the Earth's

02:56.180 --> 03:01.020
magnetic field, diverting the energy storm to the North and South Poles, where energetic

03:01.020 --> 03:06.300
particles fall into the atmosphere, causing the atmosphere to glow and creating beautiful

03:06.300 --> 03:12.940
auroras. As with any sort of weather, most of the time, things are fine. Sometimes there

03:12.940 --> 03:18.980
are hurricanes though, or in the case of the Sun, solar superstorms. And we know that they

03:18.980 --> 03:24.360
happen once or twice every century. If one were to happen today, we would first detect

03:24.360 --> 03:30.320
strong solar flares, a sort of flash before the much more dangerous thunder. The thunder

03:30.320 --> 03:36.520
is a CME, consisting of billions of tons of hot magnetic plasma that crosses the 150

03:36.520 --> 03:42.420
million kilometers between the Sun and Earth in less than a day. When it arrives, it causes

03:42.420 --> 03:47.560
a shockwave that violently compresses the Earth's magnetic field and transfers energy

03:47.560 --> 03:53.200
into the magnetosphere. But it can get worse. If the magnetic field of the CME is aligned

03:53.200 --> 03:58.220
to Earth's in just the right way, the two magnetic fields merge. As the magnetic cloud

03:58.220 --> 04:03.940
passes over Earth, it stretches the Earth's field into a long tail. Eventually, the energy

04:03.940 --> 04:09.700
stored in the tail becomes too much to contain. It snaps and explosively releases its energy

04:09.700 --> 04:17.380
towards Earth. A geomagnetic storm has begun. A few hundred years ago, nobody would have

04:17.380 --> 04:21.760
cared. This storm gushing over the Earth is not relevant for machines made out of meat

04:21.760 --> 04:28.200
and bones. But it's very relevant for machines made out of metal and wire. Remember the dynamo

04:28.200 --> 04:34.440
– magnetism creates electric currents. Earth in the 21st century is covered in millions

04:34.440 --> 04:39.760
of kilometers of wires transporting electricity and a complex grid of machines like transformers

04:39.760 --> 04:45.420
that make this transfer possible. A CME's energy can induce currents in our power grid

04:45.420 --> 04:50.280
that can either completely shut it down or worse, destroy the transformer stations that

04:50.280 --> 04:56.040
keep our grid running. This has happened already, like when the Quebec power grid failed after

04:56.040 --> 05:01.760
a strong solar storm in 1989. But in general, our engineers know how to deal with these

05:01.760 --> 05:07.440
storms and so we usually don't even notice. The last time a solar hurricane washed over

05:07.440 --> 05:14.200
Earth was in 1859. The Carrington event, the largest geomagnetic storms ever observed on

05:14.200 --> 05:20.440
Earth. Massive auroras occurred as far south as the Caribbean. In some places, they were

05:20.440 --> 05:26.040
so bright that people got up thinking the sun was rising. Luckily, we only had one sort

05:26.040 --> 05:31.640
of modern technology – telegraph systems. They failed all over the world, shocking their

05:31.640 --> 05:37.920
operators and chucking out sparks. Today, we have a tad more technology and our luck

05:37.920 --> 05:43.840
may run out soon. Another bad solar storm is bound to happen eventually. A storm as

05:43.840 --> 05:49.860
strong as the Carrington event missed Earth only by a small margin in 2012. Studies projected

05:49.860 --> 05:54.100
that it would have inflicted serious damage to electronic systems globally, costing up

05:54.100 --> 06:00.980
to $2.6 trillion to the US alone. The time to replace all the damaged systems was estimated

06:00.980 --> 06:07.780
at between 4 and 10 years. It's hard to say how bad it could have been. Experts disagreed.

06:07.780 --> 06:10.980
Some assumed there would just be temporary blackouts, but others worried it could be

06:10.980 --> 06:17.040
much worse. We won't know for sure until a big solar hurricane hits us. The probability

06:17.040 --> 06:22.800
of such an event is estimated to be 12% per decade. That's about a 50-50 chance of at

06:22.800 --> 06:30.240
least one in the next 50 years. And there is more unsettling news. A 2019 paper found

06:30.240 --> 06:37.200
that even calm stars like our sun can create superflares every few thousand years. Eruptions

06:37.200 --> 06:42.320
orders of magnitude stronger than the strongest storms we have observed in the solar system.

06:42.320 --> 06:48.300
If such a storm hits us unprepared, the consequences could be catastrophic. It's hard to overstate

06:48.300 --> 06:54.280
how much we depend on electricity. It's not just the lights at home. It means no computers,

06:54.280 --> 07:00.000
no communication, no navigation. A sustained power outage might lead to a breakdown of

07:00.000 --> 07:06.660
the supply chain. Water supply systems failing and hospital generators running dry. Supermarkets

07:06.660 --> 07:12.260
not being refilled while food rots in the fields. The lack of power might make it extremely

07:12.260 --> 07:19.300
hard to reboot our broken power grid, taking years or decades to restart our starving civilization.

07:19.300 --> 07:25.180
Okay, time to panic. As much as daily newspapers might like for solar storms to send us back

07:25.180 --> 07:30.760
to the Stone Age, they probably won't. Fortunately, even though solar storms aren't preventable,

07:30.760 --> 07:36.100
virtually all of their nasty side effects are. Scientists observing the sun have a few

07:36.100 --> 07:41.740
hours up to a few days to see a CME coming. And the engineers working the systems that

07:41.740 --> 07:47.420
keep the world running are well aware of the risks posed by solar storms. Transformers

07:47.420 --> 07:53.180
and substations can be taken offline. Short preventative blackouts, or in other words,

07:53.180 --> 07:58.740
by unplugging stuff. Engineers can open up extra lines to dissipate the extra power.

07:58.740 --> 08:03.660
And with investment and upgrades cheap compared to those other natural disasters require,

08:03.660 --> 08:08.660
we could protect the world's electric grid against even the nastiest of storms. But we

08:08.660 --> 08:15.500
do need to prepare. While the risk is manageable, it is real. For while our sun bathes us in

08:15.500 --> 08:21.580
warm and pleasant light, one day, it might send a monster our way that we better be ready

08:21.580 --> 08:23.640
for.
