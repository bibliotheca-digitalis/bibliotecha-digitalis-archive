0	9320	The Sun. Smooth and round and peaceful. Except when it suddenly vomits radiation and plasma
9320	16500	in random directions. These solar flares and Coronal Mass Ejections, or CMEs, can hit Earth
16500	22720	and have serious consequences for humanity. How exactly do they work, how bad could they
22720	36400	be, and can we prepare for them? While the Sun seems pretty solid, it's actually
36400	42520	like a very hot ocean. So hot that it rips atoms into electrons and nuclei, all flowing
42520	48120	around each other in a plasma. This plasma is pushed around and shaped by the Sun's
48120	53020	magnetic field, similar to how the Sun's gravitational field reaches out to the planets
53020	59000	and shapes their orbits. But magnetism is very different from gravity. Magnetism is
59000	65760	one part of a dual force, electromagnetism. Electricity creates magnetic fields, and magnetic
65760	71360	fields create electricity. On the Sun, the plasma, made of electrically charged protons
71360	76580	and electrons, creates a magnetic field as they move, and this magnetic field then shapes
76580	82400	the flow of particles. They're stuck in a dynamic feedback loop called a dynamo, which
82400	88420	keeps the Sun's magnetic field alive. This magnetic field stores enormous amounts of
88420	93860	energy and leaks out over the solar system. It carries with it a constant trickle of solar
93860	99780	plasma like a light rain known as the solar wind, creating a sort of space weather. But
99780	105120	it isn't always calm and smooth. As the Sun's plasma churns and flows around itself, its
105160	110440	magnetic field gets all kinked and twisted. This creates magnetic knots that build up
110440	115880	enormous amounts of energy. When the magnetic knots break, like a tangle of springs exploding
115880	121840	outwards, the Sun can vomit plasma and other awful things into the solar system. These
121840	128220	solar storms come in many types, like solar flares, a tidal wave of high energy radiation.
128220	132080	They race through the solar system at the speed of light, sweeping up protons in the
132080	138560	solar wind, accelerating them into a high-speed solar proton storm. Then there are coronal
138560	144160	mass ejections, which rip millions or billions of tons of plasma from the Sun's atmosphere,
144160	150080	catapulting it through the solar system at speeds of up to 9 million kilometers per hour.
150080	156120	When these monsters hit us, nothing happens on Earth. While even smaller storms can damage
156120	160220	satellites, affect radio communication, or will be dangerous to astronauts, for people
160220	165300	on the surface, space weather is harmless. Earth's atmosphere protects us from the worst
165300	170180	effects of a solar flare by absorbing the blast of X-rays high up in the atmosphere,
170180	176180	well before it reaches the surface. The electrified plasma from a CME is deflected by the Earth's
176180	181020	magnetic field, diverting the energy storm to the North and South Poles, where energetic
181020	186300	particles fall into the atmosphere, causing the atmosphere to glow and creating beautiful
186300	192940	auroras. As with any sort of weather, most of the time, things are fine. Sometimes there
192940	198980	are hurricanes though, or in the case of the Sun, solar superstorms. And we know that they
198980	204360	happen once or twice every century. If one were to happen today, we would first detect
204360	210320	strong solar flares, a sort of flash before the much more dangerous thunder. The thunder
210320	216520	is a CME, consisting of billions of tons of hot magnetic plasma that crosses the 150
216520	222420	million kilometers between the Sun and Earth in less than a day. When it arrives, it causes
222420	227560	a shockwave that violently compresses the Earth's magnetic field and transfers energy
227560	233200	into the magnetosphere. But it can get worse. If the magnetic field of the CME is aligned
233200	238220	to Earth's in just the right way, the two magnetic fields merge. As the magnetic cloud
238220	243940	passes over Earth, it stretches the Earth's field into a long tail. Eventually, the energy
243940	249700	stored in the tail becomes too much to contain. It snaps and explosively releases its energy
249700	257380	towards Earth. A geomagnetic storm has begun. A few hundred years ago, nobody would have
257380	261760	cared. This storm gushing over the Earth is not relevant for machines made out of meat
261760	268200	and bones. But it's very relevant for machines made out of metal and wire. Remember the dynamo
268200	274440	– magnetism creates electric currents. Earth in the 21st century is covered in millions
274440	279760	of kilometers of wires transporting electricity and a complex grid of machines like transformers
279760	285420	that make this transfer possible. A CME's energy can induce currents in our power grid
285420	290280	that can either completely shut it down or worse, destroy the transformer stations that
290280	296040	keep our grid running. This has happened already, like when the Quebec power grid failed after
296040	301760	a strong solar storm in 1989. But in general, our engineers know how to deal with these
301760	307440	storms and so we usually don't even notice. The last time a solar hurricane washed over
307440	314200	Earth was in 1859. The Carrington event, the largest geomagnetic storms ever observed on
314200	320440	Earth. Massive auroras occurred as far south as the Caribbean. In some places, they were
320440	326040	so bright that people got up thinking the sun was rising. Luckily, we only had one sort
326040	331640	of modern technology – telegraph systems. They failed all over the world, shocking their
331640	337920	operators and chucking out sparks. Today, we have a tad more technology and our luck
337920	343840	may run out soon. Another bad solar storm is bound to happen eventually. A storm as
343840	349860	strong as the Carrington event missed Earth only by a small margin in 2012. Studies projected
349860	354100	that it would have inflicted serious damage to electronic systems globally, costing up
354100	360980	to $2.6 trillion to the US alone. The time to replace all the damaged systems was estimated
360980	367780	at between 4 and 10 years. It's hard to say how bad it could have been. Experts disagreed.
367780	370980	Some assumed there would just be temporary blackouts, but others worried it could be
370980	377040	much worse. We won't know for sure until a big solar hurricane hits us. The probability
377040	382800	of such an event is estimated to be 12% per decade. That's about a 50-50 chance of at
382800	390240	least one in the next 50 years. And there is more unsettling news. A 2019 paper found
390240	397200	that even calm stars like our sun can create superflares every few thousand years. Eruptions
397200	402320	orders of magnitude stronger than the strongest storms we have observed in the solar system.
402320	408300	If such a storm hits us unprepared, the consequences could be catastrophic. It's hard to overstate
408300	414280	how much we depend on electricity. It's not just the lights at home. It means no computers,
414280	420000	no communication, no navigation. A sustained power outage might lead to a breakdown of
420000	426660	the supply chain. Water supply systems failing and hospital generators running dry. Supermarkets
426660	432260	not being refilled while food rots in the fields. The lack of power might make it extremely
432260	439300	hard to reboot our broken power grid, taking years or decades to restart our starving civilization.
439300	445180	Okay, time to panic. As much as daily newspapers might like for solar storms to send us back
445180	450760	to the Stone Age, they probably won't. Fortunately, even though solar storms aren't preventable,
450760	456100	virtually all of their nasty side effects are. Scientists observing the sun have a few
456100	461740	hours up to a few days to see a CME coming. And the engineers working the systems that
461740	467420	keep the world running are well aware of the risks posed by solar storms. Transformers
467420	473180	and substations can be taken offline. Short preventative blackouts, or in other words,
473180	478740	by unplugging stuff. Engineers can open up extra lines to dissipate the extra power.
478740	483660	And with investment and upgrades cheap compared to those other natural disasters require,
483660	488660	we could protect the world's electric grid against even the nastiest of storms. But we
488660	495500	do need to prepare. While the risk is manageable, it is real. For while our sun bathes us in
495500	501580	warm and pleasant light, one day, it might send a monster our way that we better be ready
501580	503640	for.
