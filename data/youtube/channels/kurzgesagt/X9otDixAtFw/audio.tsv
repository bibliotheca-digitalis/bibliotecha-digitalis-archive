0	3000	The simple questions are the hardest ones to answer.
3000	4800	What is a thing?
4800	6600	Why do things happen?
6600	9300	And why do they happen the way they do?
9300	11900	Let's try to approach this step by step.
11900	13600	What are you made of?
13600	16500	You are matter, which is made of molecules,
16500	20400	which are made of atoms, and those are made of elementary particles.
20400	24700	But, if elementary particles are the smallest things that exist,
24700	26500	what are they made of?
31000	34800	To answer a simple question, let's start simply.
34800	38400	Let's wipe the universe clean, away with matter,
38400	41800	antimatter, radiation, particles, anything.
41800	45600	Now, let's take a closer look at absolutely nothing.
45600	47500	What is empty space?
47500	49600	Is it what we call a vacuum?
49600	52600	There are no atoms, no matter, nothing.
52600	54800	Is it really all that empty?
54800	57800	Nothing gives us the body of the universe.
58400	62000	Nothing gives us the building blocks for everything.
62000	66300	In a sense, empty space is a lot like a vast, calm ocean.
66300	69100	While the water is very still when nothing is happening,
69100	72400	a stiff breeze can create some serious waves.
72400	74600	Our universe works a lot like this.
74600	76800	There are these oceans everywhere.
76800	79300	Physicists call them fields.
79300	83400	This might be strange and new, but think about radiation, for example.
83400	86600	By exciting what's known as the electromagnetic field,
86600	90200	a little kink is created, which is the particle we call the photon,
90200	92200	the particle that carries radiation.
92200	94200	We perceive it as light.
94200	96000	This isn't unique to light.
96000	98900	Every particle in the universe is made this way.
98900	103400	There are fields for every particle of matter, all with their own rules.
103400	105900	For example, along with the electromagnetic field,
105900	108500	there is an electron field everywhere in the universe,
108500	111700	and little kinks in that field are electrons.
111700	115700	Altogether, the fields of our universe can produce 17 particles,
115700	118300	which can be divided into three categories.
118300	122100	The leptons, and the quarks, and the bosons.
122100	127400	Leptons consist of the electron as well as its cousins, muon and tail particles.
127400	129900	Each has an associated neutrino.
129900	131700	Then there are quarks.
131700	134500	The quarks are the nuclear family of particles.
134500	137100	They're always found bound together in groups and pairs,
137100	141300	and make up protons and neutrons, which make up the nuclei of atoms.
141300	144600	Together, the leptons and quarks are the matter particles.
144600	146500	They make up all the things you see.
146500	149000	The air you breathe, the sun that warms you,
149000	153200	the computer you're using right now to distract yourself from the stuff you should be doing.
153200	156700	But things don't just exist, they also do stuff.
156700	159500	In some philosophical sense, the properties of a thing
159500	162900	are just as much a part of it as existence itself.
162900	166700	This is where the bosons and the fields that make them come into play.
166700	169700	While the quarks and leptons are made by matter fields,
169700	172500	the bosons are made by force fields.
172500	175200	We call a rule of the universe a force,
175200	178700	and so far, four fundamental forces have been discovered.
178700	183700	Electromagnetism, gravity, and the strong and weak nuclear forces.
183700	187500	These forces are the rulebook of a game where the pieces are particles,
187500	189500	and the game is the universe.
189500	193200	They tell particles what they can do and how they can do it.
193200	197400	Bishops move diagonally, massless particles move at the speed of light,
197400	200400	nights can jump, gravity attracts.
200400	203600	The forces are the rules for how particles interact,
203600	206600	which ultimately make them the rules for how particles assemble
206600	209400	into all the big things we see in the universe.
209400	214400	Gravity isn't just the rule for orbits around the sun or apples falling from trees.
214400	219200	As a rule, it says matter attracts, which builds planets and stars.
219200	223400	Electromagnetism isn't just a rule for magnets attracting or repelling,
223400	225700	or electric currents in light bulbs.
225700	229700	It governs all atomic bonds, building every molecule.
229700	234700	Together, forces and particles are sort of like the tinker toys of existence.
234700	236700	The bosons are like messengers,
236700	240000	passed between, you could say, connecting the matter particles,
240000	242700	which they use to tell each other how to move.
242700	247500	Each particle uses a certain set of the forces to interact with other particles.
247500	252500	Quarks, for example, can interact with each other with electromagnetism and the strong nuclear force,
252500	256500	but electrons don't use the strong force, just electromagnetism.
256500	259000	The quarks exchange strong force bosons,
259000	261800	communicating the strong nuclear attraction to each other,
261800	267500	while the protons they build exchange particles of electromagnetism, photons, with the electrons.
267500	270300	Thus, the quarks end up locked up in nuclei,
270300	275000	while the electrons remain attached by their electric attraction, building atoms.
275000	279000	Even though the universe has lots of big messy phenomena like life,
279000	282500	supernova and computers that seem complex on the surface,
282500	284500	if you zoom in far enough on anything,
284500	290000	you just get 17 particles emerging from underlying fields, playing a game with four rules.
290000	293500	To summarize, in the most basic form we know right now,
293500	295500	this is what things are.
295500	299500	This theory is what physicists call the standard model of particle physics.
299500	304500	You are basically nothing more than disturbances on an ocean that's excited by energy
304500	308500	and guided by forces that make up the rules of the universe.
310000	312500	But why? And what is a force?
312500	316500	We'll have to explore a few more simple questions to get to the bottom of this.
316500	320000	We made some wallpapers from some of the graphics in this video.
