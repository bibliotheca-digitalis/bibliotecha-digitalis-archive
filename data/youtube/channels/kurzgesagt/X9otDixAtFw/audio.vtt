00:00.000 --> 00:03.000
The simple questions are the hardest ones to answer.

00:03.000 --> 00:04.800
What is a thing?

00:04.800 --> 00:06.600
Why do things happen?

00:06.600 --> 00:09.300
And why do they happen the way they do?

00:09.300 --> 00:11.900
Let's try to approach this step by step.

00:11.900 --> 00:13.600
What are you made of?

00:13.600 --> 00:16.500
You are matter, which is made of molecules,

00:16.500 --> 00:20.400
which are made of atoms, and those are made of elementary particles.

00:20.400 --> 00:24.700
But, if elementary particles are the smallest things that exist,

00:24.700 --> 00:26.500
what are they made of?

00:31.000 --> 00:34.800
To answer a simple question, let's start simply.

00:34.800 --> 00:38.400
Let's wipe the universe clean, away with matter,

00:38.400 --> 00:41.800
antimatter, radiation, particles, anything.

00:41.800 --> 00:45.600
Now, let's take a closer look at absolutely nothing.

00:45.600 --> 00:47.500
What is empty space?

00:47.500 --> 00:49.600
Is it what we call a vacuum?

00:49.600 --> 00:52.600
There are no atoms, no matter, nothing.

00:52.600 --> 00:54.800
Is it really all that empty?

00:54.800 --> 00:57.800
Nothing gives us the body of the universe.

00:58.400 --> 01:02.000
Nothing gives us the building blocks for everything.

01:02.000 --> 01:06.300
In a sense, empty space is a lot like a vast, calm ocean.

01:06.300 --> 01:09.100
While the water is very still when nothing is happening,

01:09.100 --> 01:12.400
a stiff breeze can create some serious waves.

01:12.400 --> 01:14.600
Our universe works a lot like this.

01:14.600 --> 01:16.800
There are these oceans everywhere.

01:16.800 --> 01:19.300
Physicists call them fields.

01:19.300 --> 01:23.400
This might be strange and new, but think about radiation, for example.

01:23.400 --> 01:26.600
By exciting what's known as the electromagnetic field,

01:26.600 --> 01:30.200
a little kink is created, which is the particle we call the photon,

01:30.200 --> 01:32.200
the particle that carries radiation.

01:32.200 --> 01:34.200
We perceive it as light.

01:34.200 --> 01:36.000
This isn't unique to light.

01:36.000 --> 01:38.900
Every particle in the universe is made this way.

01:38.900 --> 01:43.400
There are fields for every particle of matter, all with their own rules.

01:43.400 --> 01:45.900
For example, along with the electromagnetic field,

01:45.900 --> 01:48.500
there is an electron field everywhere in the universe,

01:48.500 --> 01:51.700
and little kinks in that field are electrons.

01:51.700 --> 01:55.700
Altogether, the fields of our universe can produce 17 particles,

01:55.700 --> 01:58.300
which can be divided into three categories.

01:58.300 --> 02:02.100
The leptons, and the quarks, and the bosons.

02:02.100 --> 02:07.400
Leptons consist of the electron as well as its cousins, muon and tail particles.

02:07.400 --> 02:09.900
Each has an associated neutrino.

02:09.900 --> 02:11.700
Then there are quarks.

02:11.700 --> 02:14.500
The quarks are the nuclear family of particles.

02:14.500 --> 02:17.100
They're always found bound together in groups and pairs,

02:17.100 --> 02:21.300
and make up protons and neutrons, which make up the nuclei of atoms.

02:21.300 --> 02:24.600
Together, the leptons and quarks are the matter particles.

02:24.600 --> 02:26.500
They make up all the things you see.

02:26.500 --> 02:29.000
The air you breathe, the sun that warms you,

02:29.000 --> 02:33.200
the computer you're using right now to distract yourself from the stuff you should be doing.

02:33.200 --> 02:36.700
But things don't just exist, they also do stuff.

02:36.700 --> 02:39.500
In some philosophical sense, the properties of a thing

02:39.500 --> 02:42.900
are just as much a part of it as existence itself.

02:42.900 --> 02:46.700
This is where the bosons and the fields that make them come into play.

02:46.700 --> 02:49.700
While the quarks and leptons are made by matter fields,

02:49.700 --> 02:52.500
the bosons are made by force fields.

02:52.500 --> 02:55.200
We call a rule of the universe a force,

02:55.200 --> 02:58.700
and so far, four fundamental forces have been discovered.

02:58.700 --> 03:03.700
Electromagnetism, gravity, and the strong and weak nuclear forces.

03:03.700 --> 03:07.500
These forces are the rulebook of a game where the pieces are particles,

03:07.500 --> 03:09.500
and the game is the universe.

03:09.500 --> 03:13.200
They tell particles what they can do and how they can do it.

03:13.200 --> 03:17.400
Bishops move diagonally, massless particles move at the speed of light,

03:17.400 --> 03:20.400
nights can jump, gravity attracts.

03:20.400 --> 03:23.600
The forces are the rules for how particles interact,

03:23.600 --> 03:26.600
which ultimately make them the rules for how particles assemble

03:26.600 --> 03:29.400
into all the big things we see in the universe.

03:29.400 --> 03:34.400
Gravity isn't just the rule for orbits around the sun or apples falling from trees.

03:34.400 --> 03:39.200
As a rule, it says matter attracts, which builds planets and stars.

03:39.200 --> 03:43.400
Electromagnetism isn't just a rule for magnets attracting or repelling,

03:43.400 --> 03:45.700
or electric currents in light bulbs.

03:45.700 --> 03:49.700
It governs all atomic bonds, building every molecule.

03:49.700 --> 03:54.700
Together, forces and particles are sort of like the tinker toys of existence.

03:54.700 --> 03:56.700
The bosons are like messengers,

03:56.700 --> 04:00.000
passed between, you could say, connecting the matter particles,

04:00.000 --> 04:02.700
which they use to tell each other how to move.

04:02.700 --> 04:07.500
Each particle uses a certain set of the forces to interact with other particles.

04:07.500 --> 04:12.500
Quarks, for example, can interact with each other with electromagnetism and the strong nuclear force,

04:12.500 --> 04:16.500
but electrons don't use the strong force, just electromagnetism.

04:16.500 --> 04:19.000
The quarks exchange strong force bosons,

04:19.000 --> 04:21.800
communicating the strong nuclear attraction to each other,

04:21.800 --> 04:27.500
while the protons they build exchange particles of electromagnetism, photons, with the electrons.

04:27.500 --> 04:30.300
Thus, the quarks end up locked up in nuclei,

04:30.300 --> 04:35.000
while the electrons remain attached by their electric attraction, building atoms.

04:35.000 --> 04:39.000
Even though the universe has lots of big messy phenomena like life,

04:39.000 --> 04:42.500
supernova and computers that seem complex on the surface,

04:42.500 --> 04:44.500
if you zoom in far enough on anything,

04:44.500 --> 04:50.000
you just get 17 particles emerging from underlying fields, playing a game with four rules.

04:50.000 --> 04:53.500
To summarize, in the most basic form we know right now,

04:53.500 --> 04:55.500
this is what things are.

04:55.500 --> 04:59.500
This theory is what physicists call the standard model of particle physics.

04:59.500 --> 05:04.500
You are basically nothing more than disturbances on an ocean that's excited by energy

05:04.500 --> 05:08.500
and guided by forces that make up the rules of the universe.

05:10.000 --> 05:12.500
But why? And what is a force?

05:12.500 --> 05:16.500
We'll have to explore a few more simple questions to get to the bottom of this.

05:16.500 --> 05:20.000
We made some wallpapers from some of the graphics in this video.

We really appreciate your support.
