1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
The simple questions are the hardest ones to answer.

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:04,800
What is a thing?

3
00:00:04,800 --> 00:00:06,600
Why do things happen?

4
00:00:06,600 --> 00:00:09,300
And why do they happen the way they do?

5
00:00:09,300 --> 00:00:11,900
Let's try to approach this step by step.

6
00:00:11,900 --> 00:00:13,600
What are you made of?

7
00:00:13,600 --> 00:00:16,500
You are matter, which is made of molecules,

8
00:00:16,500 --> 00:00:20,400
which are made of atoms, and those are made of elementary particles.

9
00:00:20,400 --> 00:00:24,700
But, if elementary particles are the smallest things that exist,

10
00:00:24,700 --> 00:00:26,500
what are they made of?

11
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:34,800
To answer a simple question, let's start simply.

12
00:00:34,800 --> 00:00:38,400
Let's wipe the universe clean, away with matter,

13
00:00:38,400 --> 00:00:41,800
antimatter, radiation, particles, anything.

14
00:00:41,800 --> 00:00:45,600
Now, let's take a closer look at absolutely nothing.

15
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:47,500
What is empty space?

16
00:00:47,500 --> 00:00:49,600
Is it what we call a vacuum?

17
00:00:49,600 --> 00:00:52,600
There are no atoms, no matter, nothing.

18
00:00:52,600 --> 00:00:54,800
Is it really all that empty?

19
00:00:54,800 --> 00:00:57,800
Nothing gives us the body of the universe.

20
00:00:58,400 --> 00:01:02,000
Nothing gives us the building blocks for everything.

21
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:06,300
In a sense, empty space is a lot like a vast, calm ocean.

22
00:01:06,300 --> 00:01:09,100
While the water is very still when nothing is happening,

23
00:01:09,100 --> 00:01:12,400
a stiff breeze can create some serious waves.

24
00:01:12,400 --> 00:01:14,600
Our universe works a lot like this.

25
00:01:14,600 --> 00:01:16,800
There are these oceans everywhere.

26
00:01:16,800 --> 00:01:19,300
Physicists call them fields.

27
00:01:19,300 --> 00:01:23,400
This might be strange and new, but think about radiation, for example.

28
00:01:23,400 --> 00:01:26,600
By exciting what's known as the electromagnetic field,

29
00:01:26,600 --> 00:01:30,200
a little kink is created, which is the particle we call the photon,

30
00:01:30,200 --> 00:01:32,200
the particle that carries radiation.

31
00:01:32,200 --> 00:01:34,200
We perceive it as light.

32
00:01:34,200 --> 00:01:36,000
This isn't unique to light.

33
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,900
Every particle in the universe is made this way.

34
00:01:38,900 --> 00:01:43,400
There are fields for every particle of matter, all with their own rules.

35
00:01:43,400 --> 00:01:45,900
For example, along with the electromagnetic field,

36
00:01:45,900 --> 00:01:48,500
there is an electron field everywhere in the universe,

37
00:01:48,500 --> 00:01:51,700
and little kinks in that field are electrons.

38
00:01:51,700 --> 00:01:55,700
Altogether, the fields of our universe can produce 17 particles,

39
00:01:55,700 --> 00:01:58,300
which can be divided into three categories.

40
00:01:58,300 --> 00:02:02,100
The leptons, and the quarks, and the bosons.

41
00:02:02,100 --> 00:02:07,400
Leptons consist of the electron as well as its cousins, muon and tail particles.

42
00:02:07,400 --> 00:02:09,900
Each has an associated neutrino.

43
00:02:09,900 --> 00:02:11,700
Then there are quarks.

44
00:02:11,700 --> 00:02:14,500
The quarks are the nuclear family of particles.

45
00:02:14,500 --> 00:02:17,100
They're always found bound together in groups and pairs,

46
00:02:17,100 --> 00:02:21,300
and make up protons and neutrons, which make up the nuclei of atoms.

47
00:02:21,300 --> 00:02:24,600
Together, the leptons and quarks are the matter particles.

48
00:02:24,600 --> 00:02:26,500
They make up all the things you see.

49
00:02:26,500 --> 00:02:29,000
The air you breathe, the sun that warms you,

50
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:33,200
the computer you're using right now to distract yourself from the stuff you should be doing.

51
00:02:33,200 --> 00:02:36,700
But things don't just exist, they also do stuff.

52
00:02:36,700 --> 00:02:39,500
In some philosophical sense, the properties of a thing

53
00:02:39,500 --> 00:02:42,900
are just as much a part of it as existence itself.

54
00:02:42,900 --> 00:02:46,700
This is where the bosons and the fields that make them come into play.

55
00:02:46,700 --> 00:02:49,700
While the quarks and leptons are made by matter fields,

56
00:02:49,700 --> 00:02:52,500
the bosons are made by force fields.

57
00:02:52,500 --> 00:02:55,200
We call a rule of the universe a force,

58
00:02:55,200 --> 00:02:58,700
and so far, four fundamental forces have been discovered.

59
00:02:58,700 --> 00:03:03,700
Electromagnetism, gravity, and the strong and weak nuclear forces.

60
00:03:03,700 --> 00:03:07,500
These forces are the rulebook of a game where the pieces are particles,

61
00:03:07,500 --> 00:03:09,500
and the game is the universe.

62
00:03:09,500 --> 00:03:13,200
They tell particles what they can do and how they can do it.

63
00:03:13,200 --> 00:03:17,400
Bishops move diagonally, massless particles move at the speed of light,

64
00:03:17,400 --> 00:03:20,400
nights can jump, gravity attracts.

65
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:23,600
The forces are the rules for how particles interact,

66
00:03:23,600 --> 00:03:26,600
which ultimately make them the rules for how particles assemble

67
00:03:26,600 --> 00:03:29,400
into all the big things we see in the universe.

68
00:03:29,400 --> 00:03:34,400
Gravity isn't just the rule for orbits around the sun or apples falling from trees.

69
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:39,200
As a rule, it says matter attracts, which builds planets and stars.

70
00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:43,400
Electromagnetism isn't just a rule for magnets attracting or repelling,

71
00:03:43,400 --> 00:03:45,700
or electric currents in light bulbs.

72
00:03:45,700 --> 00:03:49,700
It governs all atomic bonds, building every molecule.

73
00:03:49,700 --> 00:03:54,700
Together, forces and particles are sort of like the tinker toys of existence.

74
00:03:54,700 --> 00:03:56,700
The bosons are like messengers,

75
00:03:56,700 --> 00:04:00,000
passed between, you could say, connecting the matter particles,

76
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,700
which they use to tell each other how to move.

77
00:04:02,700 --> 00:04:07,500
Each particle uses a certain set of the forces to interact with other particles.

78
00:04:07,500 --> 00:04:12,500
Quarks, for example, can interact with each other with electromagnetism and the strong nuclear force,

79
00:04:12,500 --> 00:04:16,500
but electrons don't use the strong force, just electromagnetism.

80
00:04:16,500 --> 00:04:19,000
The quarks exchange strong force bosons,

81
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:21,800
communicating the strong nuclear attraction to each other,

82
00:04:21,800 --> 00:04:27,500
while the protons they build exchange particles of electromagnetism, photons, with the electrons.

83
00:04:27,500 --> 00:04:30,300
Thus, the quarks end up locked up in nuclei,

84
00:04:30,300 --> 00:04:35,000
while the electrons remain attached by their electric attraction, building atoms.

85
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:39,000
Even though the universe has lots of big messy phenomena like life,

86
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:42,500
supernova and computers that seem complex on the surface,

87
00:04:42,500 --> 00:04:44,500
if you zoom in far enough on anything,

88
00:04:44,500 --> 00:04:50,000
you just get 17 particles emerging from underlying fields, playing a game with four rules.

89
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:53,500
To summarize, in the most basic form we know right now,

90
00:04:53,500 --> 00:04:55,500
this is what things are.

91
00:04:55,500 --> 00:04:59,500
This theory is what physicists call the standard model of particle physics.

92
00:04:59,500 --> 00:05:04,500
You are basically nothing more than disturbances on an ocean that's excited by energy

93
00:05:04,500 --> 00:05:08,500
and guided by forces that make up the rules of the universe.

94
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:12,500
But why? And what is a force?

95
00:05:12,500 --> 00:05:16,500
We'll have to explore a few more simple questions to get to the bottom of this.

96
00:05:16,500 --> 00:05:20,000
We made some wallpapers from some of the graphics in this video.
