0	7000	Deep in tropical jungles lie floating kingdoms ruled by beautiful and deadly masters.
7000	15000	They're sort of the high elves of the ant kingdoms, talented architects that create castles and city-states.
15000	23000	But they are also fierce and expansionist warriors, and their kingdoms are ensnared in a never-ending war for survival.
23000	26000	Oekofla Weaver Ants.
31000	39000	Oekofla weavers walk on long legs, have slender bodies and large eyes, which make them look pretty cute.
39000	46000	Although their strong mandibles and the ability to shoot acid also make them pretty good at killing.
46000	48000	But more on that later.
48000	54000	Their colonies usually have two to three worker classes that vary dramatically in size.
54000	59000	Majors, miners, and sometimes even tiny minim-workers.
59000	65000	Depending on location and species, they vary in color from dark brown to emerald green.
65000	72000	Other than their fancy looks, what makes weavers special is that they're in the kingdom building business.
72000	81000	They like to build at pretty much all heights, starting in shrubs a few centimeters above the ground and up to ten meters in the tree canopy.
81000	84000	But they're not satisfied with ruling just one plant.
84000	91000	Weavers will look for twigs or lianas that bridge the gap to other trees and expand to every plant they can reach.
91000	97000	This way, colonies spread upwards and sideways through the treetops.
97000	106000	The largest weaver ant kingdoms we know of occupy up to 1,600 square meters, around four basketball courts.
106000	111000	A lot of ground to cover for tiny ants and impossibly hard to control.
111000	117000	So, weaver ants construct dozens of nests scattered all over their territory.
117000	119000	Outposts to defend the kingdom.
119000	123000	Tubes or balls made from leaves and ghostly silk sheets.
123000	129000	These masterpieces of high ant architecture are created by the weaver majors,
129000	136000	the larger worker ants which are responsible for the more dangerous jobs like fighting, foraging, and nest construction.
137000	142000	To start a new nest, a major tries to bend different leaves in her surroundings into a tube.
142000	147000	If one of the leaves is flexible enough, more workers will arrive to help.
147000	155000	Chains of workers pull the leaf's edges together or reach across gaps and grab distant leaves to add them to the construction.
155000	162000	While the bending and pulling is going on, other workers carry larvae from the closest nest to the construction site.
162000	166000	Usually, ant larvae spin themselves a cocoon to protect themselves.
166000	172000	But the weaver ant larvae give all of their silk to the colony as building material.
172000	179000	So, when the workers tap the larvae's heads on the leaf, they release their sticky thread like tiny, cute glue guns.
179000	185000	This way, the workers sew the bent leaf onto itself so it won't unfold anymore.
185000	192000	This creates a central chamber that's used as the basis for up to 300 more leaves that are wound around it.
192000	197000	Together, they form little pockets and act as additional rooms for the new outpost.
197000	203000	To make it even more cozy, minor workers use the larvae to weave additional floors and chambers.
203000	210000	Nests are usually constructed as barracks on the territory's borders or as storage for brood and food supplies.
210000	218000	This way, the ants don't need to cross vast distances to the headquarters but have soldiers close to any potential point of conflict.
218000	224000	Apart from one special nest in the middle of the network, which is reserved for the queen and her guards.
224000	230000	Here, she produces hundreds of eggs a day, which get transferred to suitable nests with brood chambers.
230000	239000	So a colony is a network of little castles and moats connected by suspension bridges made from leaves, lianas, and twigs.
239000	244000	An established colony easily has half a million individuals that need to be fed.
244000	252000	Fortunately, weaver ants evolved to have very close and beneficial relationships with their hosts, shrubs, and trees.
252000	257000	The tree gives the ants a home and access to sweet sap to drink.
257000	264000	But maybe even more importantly, it allows them to cultivate cattle like aphids or caterpillars that produce honeydew for them.
264000	269000	This would usually hurt a tree, but these insects belong to a small group of VIPs.
269000	274000	Only a few selected neighbors and the ants' cattle are allowed on the fruit tree.
274000	281000	Many other insects and even larger herbivores are scared off or even killed and eaten.
281000	289000	So in most cases, the tree only has to tolerate acceptable levels of damage while being protected from more dangerous pests.
289000	295000	The weaver ant kingdom could be an ant paradise if there wasn't competition.
295000	297000	Mostly from other kingdoms.
297000	303000	Just like medieval humans, every queen seeks to conquer others and make their land their own.
303000	307000	Controlling fertile land is the key to survive in the jungle.
307000	313000	And if a kingdom loses too much of it, it shrinks and is overrun or starves to death.
313000	319000	So expanding and defending their borders is critical to keep the colony alive.
319000	326000	When a kingdom invades another, it first gathers an army of a few thousand mages who make their way towards the opposing colony.
326000	330000	The goal is to steal a bit of territory and take it over.
330000	336000	Defending weaver patrols quickly spot the invaders and immediately release an alarm pheromone.
336000	343000	Some rush to the front to defend, while others rush to the closest outposts for help, marking their route with pheromones.
343000	351000	Whenever they meet other sisters, they jerk their bodies as if in a fight to signal them to follow the pheromone trail to the front line.
351000	360000	At the site of battle, mages from both parties raise their bodies, circle each other with mandibles wide open, and try to seize their opponents.
360000	367000	If an ant gets a hold of her opponent, the victim is pulled into a group of allied mages and pinned down.
367000	374000	The ants then rip the victim apart, clipping off antennae and legs and slicing open their abdomens.
374000	382000	To slow down the advance of the attackers, the defending mages squirt formic acid over the battlefield to chemically burn their targets.
382000	386000	This is soon answered in the same way by the attackers.
386000	392000	In the chaotic battle, both parties lose countless fighters on the increasingly acidic battlefield.
392000	399000	After a few minutes, the backup from the outposts arrive and the time window for a successful attack slowly closes.
399000	402000	This is when the battle turns.
402000	405000	The defenders slowly push back the attack party.
405000	409000	In the end, the attackers can't keep up and have to retreat.
409000	413000	For both parties, it was a costly battle.
413000	420000	Thousands of corpses lie piled up on the ground under the battlefield, and many ants are severely injured.
420000	424000	The defending colonies' nests and brood are safe, though.
424000	428000	The attackers' attempt to steal new, valuable territory has failed.
428000	431000	For today, they'll try again soon.
431000	434000	But the kingdom will be ready.
434000	440000	For the high ants of the floating kingdoms, war is nothing special, it's just a fact of life.
440000	444000	Because as we know, empires never ever have enough.
444000	447000	And the weaver ants are ready to fight.
