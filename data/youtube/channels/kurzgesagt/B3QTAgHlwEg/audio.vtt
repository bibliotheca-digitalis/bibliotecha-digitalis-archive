00:00.000 --> 00:07.000
Deep in tropical jungles lie floating kingdoms ruled by beautiful and deadly masters.

00:07.000 --> 00:15.000
They're sort of the high elves of the ant kingdoms, talented architects that create castles and city-states.

00:15.000 --> 00:23.000
But they are also fierce and expansionist warriors, and their kingdoms are ensnared in a never-ending war for survival.

00:23.000 --> 00:26.000
Oekofla Weaver Ants.

00:31.000 --> 00:39.000
Oekofla weavers walk on long legs, have slender bodies and large eyes, which make them look pretty cute.

00:39.000 --> 00:46.000
Although their strong mandibles and the ability to shoot acid also make them pretty good at killing.

00:46.000 --> 00:48.000
But more on that later.

00:48.000 --> 00:54.000
Their colonies usually have two to three worker classes that vary dramatically in size.

00:54.000 --> 00:59.000
Majors, miners, and sometimes even tiny minim-workers.

00:59.000 --> 01:05.000
Depending on location and species, they vary in color from dark brown to emerald green.

01:05.000 --> 01:12.000
Other than their fancy looks, what makes weavers special is that they're in the kingdom building business.

01:12.000 --> 01:21.000
They like to build at pretty much all heights, starting in shrubs a few centimeters above the ground and up to ten meters in the tree canopy.

01:21.000 --> 01:24.000
But they're not satisfied with ruling just one plant.

01:24.000 --> 01:31.000
Weavers will look for twigs or lianas that bridge the gap to other trees and expand to every plant they can reach.

01:31.000 --> 01:37.000
This way, colonies spread upwards and sideways through the treetops.

01:37.000 --> 01:46.000
The largest weaver ant kingdoms we know of occupy up to 1,600 square meters, around four basketball courts.

01:46.000 --> 01:51.000
A lot of ground to cover for tiny ants and impossibly hard to control.

01:51.000 --> 01:57.000
So, weaver ants construct dozens of nests scattered all over their territory.

01:57.000 --> 01:59.000
Outposts to defend the kingdom.

01:59.000 --> 02:03.000
Tubes or balls made from leaves and ghostly silk sheets.

02:03.000 --> 02:09.000
These masterpieces of high ant architecture are created by the weaver majors,

02:09.000 --> 02:16.000
the larger worker ants which are responsible for the more dangerous jobs like fighting, foraging, and nest construction.

02:17.000 --> 02:22.000
To start a new nest, a major tries to bend different leaves in her surroundings into a tube.

02:22.000 --> 02:27.000
If one of the leaves is flexible enough, more workers will arrive to help.

02:27.000 --> 02:35.000
Chains of workers pull the leaf's edges together or reach across gaps and grab distant leaves to add them to the construction.

02:35.000 --> 02:42.000
While the bending and pulling is going on, other workers carry larvae from the closest nest to the construction site.

02:42.000 --> 02:46.000
Usually, ant larvae spin themselves a cocoon to protect themselves.

02:46.000 --> 02:52.000
But the weaver ant larvae give all of their silk to the colony as building material.

02:52.000 --> 02:59.000
So, when the workers tap the larvae's heads on the leaf, they release their sticky thread like tiny, cute glue guns.

02:59.000 --> 03:05.000
This way, the workers sew the bent leaf onto itself so it won't unfold anymore.

03:05.000 --> 03:12.000
This creates a central chamber that's used as the basis for up to 300 more leaves that are wound around it.

03:12.000 --> 03:17.000
Together, they form little pockets and act as additional rooms for the new outpost.

03:17.000 --> 03:23.000
To make it even more cozy, minor workers use the larvae to weave additional floors and chambers.

03:23.000 --> 03:30.000
Nests are usually constructed as barracks on the territory's borders or as storage for brood and food supplies.

03:30.000 --> 03:38.000
This way, the ants don't need to cross vast distances to the headquarters but have soldiers close to any potential point of conflict.

03:38.000 --> 03:44.000
Apart from one special nest in the middle of the network, which is reserved for the queen and her guards.

03:44.000 --> 03:50.000
Here, she produces hundreds of eggs a day, which get transferred to suitable nests with brood chambers.

03:50.000 --> 03:59.000
So a colony is a network of little castles and moats connected by suspension bridges made from leaves, lianas, and twigs.

03:59.000 --> 04:04.000
An established colony easily has half a million individuals that need to be fed.

04:04.000 --> 04:12.000
Fortunately, weaver ants evolved to have very close and beneficial relationships with their hosts, shrubs, and trees.

04:12.000 --> 04:17.000
The tree gives the ants a home and access to sweet sap to drink.

04:17.000 --> 04:24.000
But maybe even more importantly, it allows them to cultivate cattle like aphids or caterpillars that produce honeydew for them.

04:24.000 --> 04:29.000
This would usually hurt a tree, but these insects belong to a small group of VIPs.

04:29.000 --> 04:34.000
Only a few selected neighbors and the ants' cattle are allowed on the fruit tree.

04:34.000 --> 04:41.000
Many other insects and even larger herbivores are scared off or even killed and eaten.

04:41.000 --> 04:49.000
So in most cases, the tree only has to tolerate acceptable levels of damage while being protected from more dangerous pests.

04:49.000 --> 04:55.000
The weaver ant kingdom could be an ant paradise if there wasn't competition.

04:55.000 --> 04:57.000
Mostly from other kingdoms.

04:57.000 --> 05:03.000
Just like medieval humans, every queen seeks to conquer others and make their land their own.

05:03.000 --> 05:07.000
Controlling fertile land is the key to survive in the jungle.

05:07.000 --> 05:13.000
And if a kingdom loses too much of it, it shrinks and is overrun or starves to death.

05:13.000 --> 05:19.000
So expanding and defending their borders is critical to keep the colony alive.

05:19.000 --> 05:26.000
When a kingdom invades another, it first gathers an army of a few thousand mages who make their way towards the opposing colony.

05:26.000 --> 05:30.000
The goal is to steal a bit of territory and take it over.

05:30.000 --> 05:36.000
Defending weaver patrols quickly spot the invaders and immediately release an alarm pheromone.

05:36.000 --> 05:43.000
Some rush to the front to defend, while others rush to the closest outposts for help, marking their route with pheromones.

05:43.000 --> 05:51.000
Whenever they meet other sisters, they jerk their bodies as if in a fight to signal them to follow the pheromone trail to the front line.

05:51.000 --> 06:00.000
At the site of battle, mages from both parties raise their bodies, circle each other with mandibles wide open, and try to seize their opponents.

06:00.000 --> 06:07.000
If an ant gets a hold of her opponent, the victim is pulled into a group of allied mages and pinned down.

06:07.000 --> 06:14.000
The ants then rip the victim apart, clipping off antennae and legs and slicing open their abdomens.

06:14.000 --> 06:22.000
To slow down the advance of the attackers, the defending mages squirt formic acid over the battlefield to chemically burn their targets.

06:22.000 --> 06:26.000
This is soon answered in the same way by the attackers.

06:26.000 --> 06:32.000
In the chaotic battle, both parties lose countless fighters on the increasingly acidic battlefield.

06:32.000 --> 06:39.000
After a few minutes, the backup from the outposts arrive and the time window for a successful attack slowly closes.

06:39.000 --> 06:42.000
This is when the battle turns.

06:42.000 --> 06:45.000
The defenders slowly push back the attack party.

06:45.000 --> 06:49.000
In the end, the attackers can't keep up and have to retreat.

06:49.000 --> 06:53.000
For both parties, it was a costly battle.

06:53.000 --> 07:00.000
Thousands of corpses lie piled up on the ground under the battlefield, and many ants are severely injured.

07:00.000 --> 07:04.000
The defending colonies' nests and brood are safe, though.

07:04.000 --> 07:08.000
The attackers' attempt to steal new, valuable territory has failed.

07:08.000 --> 07:11.000
For today, they'll try again soon.

07:11.000 --> 07:14.000
But the kingdom will be ready.

07:14.000 --> 07:20.000
For the high ants of the floating kingdoms, war is nothing special, it's just a fact of life.

07:20.000 --> 07:24.000
Because as we know, empires never ever have enough.

07:24.000 --> 07:27.000
And the weaver ants are ready to fight.

07:28.000 --> 07:33.000
