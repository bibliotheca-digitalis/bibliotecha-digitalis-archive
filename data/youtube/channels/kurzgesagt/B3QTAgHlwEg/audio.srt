1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,000
Deep in tropical jungles lie floating kingdoms ruled by beautiful and deadly masters.

2
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:15,000
They're sort of the high elves of the ant kingdoms, talented architects that create castles and city-states.

3
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:23,000
But they are also fierce and expansionist warriors, and their kingdoms are ensnared in a never-ending war for survival.

4
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:26,000
Oekofla Weaver Ants.

5
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:39,000
Oekofla weavers walk on long legs, have slender bodies and large eyes, which make them look pretty cute.

6
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:46,000
Although their strong mandibles and the ability to shoot acid also make them pretty good at killing.

7
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,000
But more on that later.

8
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:54,000
Their colonies usually have two to three worker classes that vary dramatically in size.

9
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:59,000
Majors, miners, and sometimes even tiny minim-workers.

10
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:05,000
Depending on location and species, they vary in color from dark brown to emerald green.

11
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:12,000
Other than their fancy looks, what makes weavers special is that they're in the kingdom building business.

12
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:21,000
They like to build at pretty much all heights, starting in shrubs a few centimeters above the ground and up to ten meters in the tree canopy.

13
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:24,000
But they're not satisfied with ruling just one plant.

14
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:31,000
Weavers will look for twigs or lianas that bridge the gap to other trees and expand to every plant they can reach.

15
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:37,000
This way, colonies spread upwards and sideways through the treetops.

16
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:46,000
The largest weaver ant kingdoms we know of occupy up to 1,600 square meters, around four basketball courts.

17
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:51,000
A lot of ground to cover for tiny ants and impossibly hard to control.

18
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:57,000
So, weaver ants construct dozens of nests scattered all over their territory.

19
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:59,000
Outposts to defend the kingdom.

20
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:03,000
Tubes or balls made from leaves and ghostly silk sheets.

21
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:09,000
These masterpieces of high ant architecture are created by the weaver majors,

22
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:16,000
the larger worker ants which are responsible for the more dangerous jobs like fighting, foraging, and nest construction.

23
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:22,000
To start a new nest, a major tries to bend different leaves in her surroundings into a tube.

24
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:27,000
If one of the leaves is flexible enough, more workers will arrive to help.

25
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:35,000
Chains of workers pull the leaf's edges together or reach across gaps and grab distant leaves to add them to the construction.

26
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:42,000
While the bending and pulling is going on, other workers carry larvae from the closest nest to the construction site.

27
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:46,000
Usually, ant larvae spin themselves a cocoon to protect themselves.

28
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:52,000
But the weaver ant larvae give all of their silk to the colony as building material.

29
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:59,000
So, when the workers tap the larvae's heads on the leaf, they release their sticky thread like tiny, cute glue guns.

30
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:05,000
This way, the workers sew the bent leaf onto itself so it won't unfold anymore.

31
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:12,000
This creates a central chamber that's used as the basis for up to 300 more leaves that are wound around it.

32
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:17,000
Together, they form little pockets and act as additional rooms for the new outpost.

33
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:23,000
To make it even more cozy, minor workers use the larvae to weave additional floors and chambers.

34
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:30,000
Nests are usually constructed as barracks on the territory's borders or as storage for brood and food supplies.

35
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:38,000
This way, the ants don't need to cross vast distances to the headquarters but have soldiers close to any potential point of conflict.

36
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:44,000
Apart from one special nest in the middle of the network, which is reserved for the queen and her guards.

37
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:50,000
Here, she produces hundreds of eggs a day, which get transferred to suitable nests with brood chambers.

38
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:59,000
So a colony is a network of little castles and moats connected by suspension bridges made from leaves, lianas, and twigs.

39
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:04,000
An established colony easily has half a million individuals that need to be fed.

40
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:12,000
Fortunately, weaver ants evolved to have very close and beneficial relationships with their hosts, shrubs, and trees.

41
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:17,000
The tree gives the ants a home and access to sweet sap to drink.

42
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:24,000
But maybe even more importantly, it allows them to cultivate cattle like aphids or caterpillars that produce honeydew for them.

43
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:29,000
This would usually hurt a tree, but these insects belong to a small group of VIPs.

44
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:34,000
Only a few selected neighbors and the ants' cattle are allowed on the fruit tree.

45
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:41,000
Many other insects and even larger herbivores are scared off or even killed and eaten.

46
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:49,000
So in most cases, the tree only has to tolerate acceptable levels of damage while being protected from more dangerous pests.

47
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:55,000
The weaver ant kingdom could be an ant paradise if there wasn't competition.

48
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:57,000
Mostly from other kingdoms.

49
00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:03,000
Just like medieval humans, every queen seeks to conquer others and make their land their own.

50
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:07,000
Controlling fertile land is the key to survive in the jungle.

51
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:13,000
And if a kingdom loses too much of it, it shrinks and is overrun or starves to death.

52
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:19,000
So expanding and defending their borders is critical to keep the colony alive.

53
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:26,000
When a kingdom invades another, it first gathers an army of a few thousand mages who make their way towards the opposing colony.

54
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:30,000
The goal is to steal a bit of territory and take it over.

55
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:36,000
Defending weaver patrols quickly spot the invaders and immediately release an alarm pheromone.

56
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:43,000
Some rush to the front to defend, while others rush to the closest outposts for help, marking their route with pheromones.

57
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:51,000
Whenever they meet other sisters, they jerk their bodies as if in a fight to signal them to follow the pheromone trail to the front line.

58
00:05:51,000 --> 00:06:00,000
At the site of battle, mages from both parties raise their bodies, circle each other with mandibles wide open, and try to seize their opponents.

59
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:07,000
If an ant gets a hold of her opponent, the victim is pulled into a group of allied mages and pinned down.

60
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:14,000
The ants then rip the victim apart, clipping off antennae and legs and slicing open their abdomens.

61
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:22,000
To slow down the advance of the attackers, the defending mages squirt formic acid over the battlefield to chemically burn their targets.

62
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:26,000
This is soon answered in the same way by the attackers.

63
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:32,000
In the chaotic battle, both parties lose countless fighters on the increasingly acidic battlefield.

64
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:39,000
After a few minutes, the backup from the outposts arrive and the time window for a successful attack slowly closes.

65
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:42,000
This is when the battle turns.

66
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:45,000
The defenders slowly push back the attack party.

67
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:49,000
In the end, the attackers can't keep up and have to retreat.

68
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:53,000
For both parties, it was a costly battle.

69
00:06:53,000 --> 00:07:00,000
Thousands of corpses lie piled up on the ground under the battlefield, and many ants are severely injured.

70
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:04,000
The defending colonies' nests and brood are safe, though.

71
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:08,000
The attackers' attempt to steal new, valuable territory has failed.

72
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:11,000
For today, they'll try again soon.

73
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:14,000
But the kingdom will be ready.

74
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:20,000
For the high ants of the floating kingdoms, war is nothing special, it's just a fact of life.

75
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:24,000
Because as we know, empires never ever have enough.

76
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:27,000
And the weaver ants are ready to fight.

77
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:33,000
This video is part 3 in a series that was developed with the support of CuriosityStream,
