00:00.000 --> 00:03.760
Three reasons why we should continue using nuclear energy.

00:04.400 --> 00:07.600
One, nuclear energy saves lives.

00:07.600 --> 00:10.720
In 2013, a study conducted by NASA

00:10.720 --> 00:15.440
found that nuclear energy has prevented around 1.8 million deaths.

00:15.440 --> 00:18.880
Even if you include the death tolls from Chernobyl and Fukushima,

00:18.880 --> 00:23.840
nuclear energy ranks last in death per energy units produced.

00:23.840 --> 00:28.560
While nuclear waste is really toxic, it's usually stored somewhere.

00:28.560 --> 00:33.360
While the toxic byproducts of fossil fuels are pumped into the air we breathe every day.

00:33.920 --> 00:37.280
So, just by reducing the amount of fossil fuels burned,

00:37.280 --> 00:42.640
countless cases of cancer or lung disease and accidents in coal mines have been avoided.

00:42.640 --> 00:46.560
If we can choose between lots of dangerous stuff being put into a deep hole

00:46.560 --> 00:51.040
and lots and lots and lots of dangerous stuff being pumped into the atmosphere,

00:51.040 --> 00:53.200
the former seems more logical.

00:53.200 --> 00:56.240
Nuclear energy feels way more dangerous though.

00:56.320 --> 01:01.840
Single catastrophic events burn into our memory while coal and oil kill silently.

01:01.840 --> 01:05.200
It's like the death rate of flying versus driving.

01:05.200 --> 01:06.880
Even in the best case scenario,

01:06.880 --> 01:11.600
it would take at least 40 years to switch to 100% renewable energy.

01:11.600 --> 01:14.720
So, for as long as we continue using fossil fuels,

01:14.720 --> 01:18.320
nuclear energy will save way more lives than it destroys.

01:19.200 --> 01:22.560
Two, nuclear energy reduces CO2 emissions.

01:23.520 --> 01:28.560
Nuclear energy is arguably way less harmful to the environment in terms of climate change

01:28.560 --> 01:31.440
than fossil fuels, our main source of energy.

01:31.440 --> 01:38.240
Since 1976, about 64 gigatons of greenhouse gas emissions have not been pumped out,

01:38.240 --> 01:40.160
thanks to nuclear energy.

01:40.160 --> 01:46.320
And by the mid-21st century, that could amount to an additional 80 to 240 gigatons.

01:46.880 --> 01:50.320
Humanity's energy consumption is rising steadily.

01:50.320 --> 01:52.400
According to US government projections,

01:52.400 --> 01:57.280
China alone will add the equivalent of a new 600 megawatt coal plant every 10 days

01:57.280 --> 01:58.480
for the next 10 years.

01:59.120 --> 02:02.480
China already burns 4 billion tons of coal each year.

02:02.480 --> 02:06.160
Coal is cheap, relatively abundant, and easy to get to.

02:06.160 --> 02:09.360
So it's not likely that humanity will stop using it soon.

02:10.000 --> 02:14.080
Nuclear energy might be the only way of dampening the effects of climate change

02:14.080 --> 02:17.840
and preventing a catastrophic man-made global warming.

02:17.840 --> 02:22.480
Compared to the other things we do, nuclear energy is relatively clean.

02:22.480 --> 02:26.080
So even if it is a good idea to quit nuclear energy long-term,

02:26.080 --> 02:30.480
it might be a good solution for the next 100 years or so compared to the alternatives.

02:31.120 --> 02:32.960
Three, new technologies.

02:33.600 --> 02:39.040
Maybe technology will solve the problem of nuclear waste and dangerous power plants.

02:39.040 --> 02:43.760
The nuclear reactors we've used so far are mostly outdated technology,

02:43.760 --> 02:47.120
because nuclear innovation stopped in the 1970s.

02:47.120 --> 02:51.760
There are models like the thorium reactor that could solve the problem altogether.

02:51.760 --> 02:55.040
Thorium is abundant, really hard to turn into nuclear weapons,

02:55.040 --> 02:59.920
and up to two orders of magnitude less wasteful than current nuclear reactors.

02:59.920 --> 03:04.000
The waste material might also be only dangerous for a few hundred years,

03:04.000 --> 03:06.480
in contrast to a couple of thousand years.

03:06.480 --> 03:10.160
One ton of thorium is estimated to provide the same amount of energy

03:10.160 --> 03:14.800
as 200 tons of uranium or 3.5 million tons of coal.

03:14.800 --> 03:19.680
So while we cannot know for sure if alternative nuclear technology will keep its promises,

03:19.680 --> 03:21.840
shouldn't we at least do more research before we

03:21.840 --> 03:25.760
forego an opportunity to solve lots of humanity's current problems?

03:25.760 --> 03:29.280
It might not be an easy challenge, but that hasn't stopped us before.

03:30.080 --> 03:32.400
So, should we use nuclear energy?

03:33.120 --> 03:35.760
There are risks involved in any great human endeavor,

03:35.760 --> 03:39.280
and we have to make an informed decision rather than rely on gut feeling.

03:40.240 --> 03:42.240
