1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,760
Three reasons why we should continue using nuclear energy.

2
00:00:04,400 --> 00:00:07,600
One, nuclear energy saves lives.

3
00:00:07,600 --> 00:00:10,720
In 2013, a study conducted by NASA

4
00:00:10,720 --> 00:00:15,440
found that nuclear energy has prevented around 1.8 million deaths.

5
00:00:15,440 --> 00:00:18,880
Even if you include the death tolls from Chernobyl and Fukushima,

6
00:00:18,880 --> 00:00:23,840
nuclear energy ranks last in death per energy units produced.

7
00:00:23,840 --> 00:00:28,560
While nuclear waste is really toxic, it's usually stored somewhere.

8
00:00:28,560 --> 00:00:33,360
While the toxic byproducts of fossil fuels are pumped into the air we breathe every day.

9
00:00:33,920 --> 00:00:37,280
So, just by reducing the amount of fossil fuels burned,

10
00:00:37,280 --> 00:00:42,640
countless cases of cancer or lung disease and accidents in coal mines have been avoided.

11
00:00:42,640 --> 00:00:46,560
If we can choose between lots of dangerous stuff being put into a deep hole

12
00:00:46,560 --> 00:00:51,040
and lots and lots and lots of dangerous stuff being pumped into the atmosphere,

13
00:00:51,040 --> 00:00:53,200
the former seems more logical.

14
00:00:53,200 --> 00:00:56,240
Nuclear energy feels way more dangerous though.

15
00:00:56,320 --> 00:01:01,840
Single catastrophic events burn into our memory while coal and oil kill silently.

16
00:01:01,840 --> 00:01:05,200
It's like the death rate of flying versus driving.

17
00:01:05,200 --> 00:01:06,880
Even in the best case scenario,

18
00:01:06,880 --> 00:01:11,600
it would take at least 40 years to switch to 100% renewable energy.

19
00:01:11,600 --> 00:01:14,720
So, for as long as we continue using fossil fuels,

20
00:01:14,720 --> 00:01:18,320
nuclear energy will save way more lives than it destroys.

21
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:22,560
Two, nuclear energy reduces CO2 emissions.

22
00:01:23,520 --> 00:01:28,560
Nuclear energy is arguably way less harmful to the environment in terms of climate change

23
00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:31,440
than fossil fuels, our main source of energy.

24
00:01:31,440 --> 00:01:38,240
Since 1976, about 64 gigatons of greenhouse gas emissions have not been pumped out,

25
00:01:38,240 --> 00:01:40,160
thanks to nuclear energy.

26
00:01:40,160 --> 00:01:46,320
And by the mid-21st century, that could amount to an additional 80 to 240 gigatons.

27
00:01:46,880 --> 00:01:50,320
Humanity's energy consumption is rising steadily.

28
00:01:50,320 --> 00:01:52,400
According to US government projections,

29
00:01:52,400 --> 00:01:57,280
China alone will add the equivalent of a new 600 megawatt coal plant every 10 days

30
00:01:57,280 --> 00:01:58,480
for the next 10 years.

31
00:01:59,120 --> 00:02:02,480
China already burns 4 billion tons of coal each year.

32
00:02:02,480 --> 00:02:06,160
Coal is cheap, relatively abundant, and easy to get to.

33
00:02:06,160 --> 00:02:09,360
So it's not likely that humanity will stop using it soon.

34
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:14,080
Nuclear energy might be the only way of dampening the effects of climate change

35
00:02:14,080 --> 00:02:17,840
and preventing a catastrophic man-made global warming.

36
00:02:17,840 --> 00:02:22,480
Compared to the other things we do, nuclear energy is relatively clean.

37
00:02:22,480 --> 00:02:26,080
So even if it is a good idea to quit nuclear energy long-term,

38
00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:30,480
it might be a good solution for the next 100 years or so compared to the alternatives.

39
00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:32,960
Three, new technologies.

40
00:02:33,600 --> 00:02:39,040
Maybe technology will solve the problem of nuclear waste and dangerous power plants.

41
00:02:39,040 --> 00:02:43,760
The nuclear reactors we've used so far are mostly outdated technology,

42
00:02:43,760 --> 00:02:47,120
because nuclear innovation stopped in the 1970s.

43
00:02:47,120 --> 00:02:51,760
There are models like the thorium reactor that could solve the problem altogether.

44
00:02:51,760 --> 00:02:55,040
Thorium is abundant, really hard to turn into nuclear weapons,

45
00:02:55,040 --> 00:02:59,920
and up to two orders of magnitude less wasteful than current nuclear reactors.

46
00:02:59,920 --> 00:03:04,000
The waste material might also be only dangerous for a few hundred years,

47
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,480
in contrast to a couple of thousand years.

48
00:03:06,480 --> 00:03:10,160
One ton of thorium is estimated to provide the same amount of energy

49
00:03:10,160 --> 00:03:14,800
as 200 tons of uranium or 3.5 million tons of coal.

50
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:19,680
So while we cannot know for sure if alternative nuclear technology will keep its promises,

51
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:21,840
shouldn't we at least do more research before we

52
00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:25,760
forego an opportunity to solve lots of humanity's current problems?

53
00:03:25,760 --> 00:03:29,280
It might not be an easy challenge, but that hasn't stopped us before.

54
00:03:30,080 --> 00:03:32,400
So, should we use nuclear energy?

55
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:35,760
There are risks involved in any great human endeavor,

56
00:03:35,760 --> 00:03:39,280
and we have to make an informed decision rather than rely on gut feeling.

57
00:03:40,240 --> 00:03:42,240
