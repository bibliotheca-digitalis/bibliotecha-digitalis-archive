0	3760	Three reasons why we should continue using nuclear energy.
4400	7600	One, nuclear energy saves lives.
7600	10720	In 2013, a study conducted by NASA
10720	15440	found that nuclear energy has prevented around 1.8 million deaths.
15440	18880	Even if you include the death tolls from Chernobyl and Fukushima,
18880	23840	nuclear energy ranks last in death per energy units produced.
23840	28560	While nuclear waste is really toxic, it's usually stored somewhere.
28560	33360	While the toxic byproducts of fossil fuels are pumped into the air we breathe every day.
33920	37280	So, just by reducing the amount of fossil fuels burned,
37280	42640	countless cases of cancer or lung disease and accidents in coal mines have been avoided.
42640	46560	If we can choose between lots of dangerous stuff being put into a deep hole
46560	51040	and lots and lots and lots of dangerous stuff being pumped into the atmosphere,
51040	53200	the former seems more logical.
53200	56240	Nuclear energy feels way more dangerous though.
56320	61840	Single catastrophic events burn into our memory while coal and oil kill silently.
61840	65200	It's like the death rate of flying versus driving.
65200	66880	Even in the best case scenario,
66880	71600	it would take at least 40 years to switch to 100% renewable energy.
71600	74720	So, for as long as we continue using fossil fuels,
74720	78320	nuclear energy will save way more lives than it destroys.
79200	82560	Two, nuclear energy reduces CO2 emissions.
83520	88560	Nuclear energy is arguably way less harmful to the environment in terms of climate change
88560	91440	than fossil fuels, our main source of energy.
91440	98240	Since 1976, about 64 gigatons of greenhouse gas emissions have not been pumped out,
98240	100160	thanks to nuclear energy.
100160	106320	And by the mid-21st century, that could amount to an additional 80 to 240 gigatons.
106880	110320	Humanity's energy consumption is rising steadily.
110320	112400	According to US government projections,
112400	117280	China alone will add the equivalent of a new 600 megawatt coal plant every 10 days
117280	118480	for the next 10 years.
119120	122480	China already burns 4 billion tons of coal each year.
122480	126160	Coal is cheap, relatively abundant, and easy to get to.
126160	129360	So it's not likely that humanity will stop using it soon.
130000	134080	Nuclear energy might be the only way of dampening the effects of climate change
134080	137840	and preventing a catastrophic man-made global warming.
137840	142480	Compared to the other things we do, nuclear energy is relatively clean.
142480	146080	So even if it is a good idea to quit nuclear energy long-term,
146080	150480	it might be a good solution for the next 100 years or so compared to the alternatives.
151120	152960	Three, new technologies.
153600	159040	Maybe technology will solve the problem of nuclear waste and dangerous power plants.
159040	163760	The nuclear reactors we've used so far are mostly outdated technology,
163760	167120	because nuclear innovation stopped in the 1970s.
167120	171760	There are models like the thorium reactor that could solve the problem altogether.
171760	175040	Thorium is abundant, really hard to turn into nuclear weapons,
175040	179920	and up to two orders of magnitude less wasteful than current nuclear reactors.
179920	184000	The waste material might also be only dangerous for a few hundred years,
184000	186480	in contrast to a couple of thousand years.
186480	190160	One ton of thorium is estimated to provide the same amount of energy
190160	194800	as 200 tons of uranium or 3.5 million tons of coal.
194800	199680	So while we cannot know for sure if alternative nuclear technology will keep its promises,
199680	201840	shouldn't we at least do more research before we
201840	205760	forego an opportunity to solve lots of humanity's current problems?
205760	209280	It might not be an easy challenge, but that hasn't stopped us before.
210080	212400	So, should we use nuclear energy?
213120	215760	There are risks involved in any great human endeavor,
215760	219280	and we have to make an informed decision rather than rely on gut feeling.
