720	5920	Neutron stars are one of the most extreme and violent things in the universe.
7280	11440	Giant atomic nuclei only a few kilometers in diameter,
11440	17680	but as massive as stars. And they owe their existence to the death of something majestic.
18400	36800	Stars exist because of a fragile balance. The mass of millions of billions of trillions of tons of
36800	42720	hot plasma are being pulled inwards by gravity and squeezed material together with so much force
42720	50560	that nuclei fuse. Hydrogen fuses into helium. This releases energy which pushes against gravity
50560	55600	and tries to escape. As long as this balance exists, stars are pretty stable.
56880	63200	Eventually, the hydrogen will be exhausted. Medium stars like our sun go through a giant
63200	68240	phase where they burn helium into carbon and oxygen before they eventually turn into white
68240	74480	dwarfs. But in stars many times the mass of our sun, things get interesting when the helium is
74480	81200	exhausted. For a moment, the balance of pressure and radiation tips and gravity wins, squeezing the
81200	86720	star tighter than before. The core burns hotter and faster, while the outer layers of the star
86720	93600	swell by hundreds of times, fusing heavier and heavier elements. Carbon burns to neon in centuries,
93600	101280	neon to oxygen in a year, oxygen to silicon in months, and silicon to iron in a day. And then,
102080	110000	death. Iron is nuclear ash. It has no energy to give and cannot be fused. The fusion suddenly
110000	115600	stops and the balance ends. Without the outward pressure from fusion, the core is crushed by the
115600	123120	enormous weight of the star above it. What happens now is awesome and scary. Particles like
123200	128320	electrons and protons really don't want to be near each other. But the pressure of the collapsing star
128320	134160	is so great that electrons and protons fuse into neutrons, which then get squeezed together as
134160	141040	tightly as in atomic nuclei. An iron ball the size of the earth is squeezed into a ball of pure
141040	147440	nuclear matter the size of a city. But not just the core, the whole star implodes, gravity pulling
147440	154880	the outer layers in at 25% the speed of light. This implosion bounces off the iron core, producing
154880	161360	a shockwave that explodes outwards and catapults the rest of the star into space. This is what we
161360	169440	call a supernova explosion, and it will outshine entire galaxies. What remains of the star is now
169440	174480	a neutron star. Its mass is around a million times the mass of the earth, but compressed
174480	181040	to an object about 25 kilometers wide. It's so dense that the mass of all living humans would
181040	187520	fit into one cubic centimeter of neutron star matter. That's roughly a billion tons in a space
187520	193200	the size of a sugar cube. Put another way, that's Mount Everest in a cup of coffee.
194400	200720	From the outside, a neutron star is unbelievably extreme. Its gravity is the strongest outside
200720	206720	black holes, and if it were any denser, it would become one. Light is bent around it,
206720	212320	meaning you can see the front and parts of the back. Their surfaces reach a million degrees
212320	219280	Celsius compared to a measly 6000 degrees for our sun. Okay, let's look inside a neutron star.
219920	225520	Although these giant atomic nuclei are stars, in many ways they're also like planets with
225520	232240	solid crusts over a liquid core. The crust is extremely hard. The outermost layers are made
232240	237120	of iron leftover from the supernova squeezed together in a crystal lattice with a sea of
237120	242960	electrons flowing through them. Going deeper, gravity squeezes nuclei closer together.
243520	250560	We find fewer and fewer protons as most merged to neutrons until we reach the base of the crust.
250560	254400	Here, nuclei are squeezed together so hard that they start to touch.
255040	260560	Protons and neutrons rearrange, making long cylinders or sheets, enormous nuclei with
260560	265840	millions of protons and neutrons shaped like spaghetti and lasagna, which physicists call
265840	272400	nuclear pasta. Nuclear pasta is so dense that it may be the strongest material in the universe,
272400	279040	basically unbreakable. Lumps of pasta inside a neutron star can even make mountains, at most a
279040	285840	few centimeters high, but many times as massive as the Himalayas. Eventually, beneath the pasta,
285840	290800	we reach the core. We're not really sure what the properties of matter are when they're squeezed
290800	296400	this hard. Protons and neutrons might dissolve into an ocean of quarks, a so-called quark gluon
296400	302800	plasma. Some of those quarks might turn into strange quarks, making a sort of strange matter,
302800	308320	with properties so extreme that we made a whole video about it. Or maybe they just stay protons
308320	315200	and neutrons. No one knows for sure, and that's why we do science. That's all pretty heavy stuff,
315200	321920	literally, so let's go back out into space. When neutron stars first collapse, they begin to spin
321920	328480	very, very fast, like a ballerina pulling her arms in. Neutron stars are celestial ballerinas,
328480	334320	spinning many times per second. This creates pulses because their magnetic field creates a
334320	340960	beam of radio waves which passes every time they spin. These radio pulsars are the best-known type
340960	348160	of neutron star about 2,000 are known of in the Milky Way. These magnetic fields are the strongest
348160	353840	in the universe, a quadrillion times stronger than Earth's after they're born. They're called
353840	360000	magnetars until they calm down a little. But the absolute best kind of neutron stars are friends
360000	366480	with other neutron stars. By radiating away energy as gravitational waves ripples in space-time,
366480	372400	their orbits can decay and they can crash into and kill each other in a kilonova explosion that spews
372400	378320	out a lot of their guts. When they do, the conditions become so extreme that for a moment
378320	384080	heavy nuclei are made again. It's not fusion putting nuclei together this time, but heavy
384080	390800	neutron-rich matter falling apart and reassembling. Only very recently, we've learned that this is
390800	396720	probably the origin of most of the heavy elements in the universe, like gold, uranium, and platinum,
396720	402720	and dozens more. So there now two neutron stars collapse and become a black hole,
402720	409360	dying yet again. Not only do stars have to die to create elements, they have to die twice.
409360	416400	Over millions of years, these atoms will mix back into the galaxy, but some of them end up in a
416400	422880	cloud which gravity pulls together to form stars and planets, repeating the cycle. Our solar system
422880	427840	is one example, and the remains of those neutron stars that came before us are all around us.
428960	434720	Our entire technological modern world was built out of the elements neutron stars made in eons
434720	441600	past, sending these atoms on a 13 billion year journey to come together and make us and our world.
442560	451280	And that's pretty cool. Until then, we can look at them on paper. The 12,020 human space
451280	458480	era calendar has arrived. You can order it now until we sell out, and then never again. Visit
458480	465120	the cloudy cities of Venus, Dyson swarm assembly on Mercury, and cross the borders of our solar
465120	472080	system. Shipping from the US and from Europe for the first time, but we deliver to every country
472080	478960	all over the world. You can also get a plushie or hoodie or poster. We have some sweet deals for you.
479840	485360	Get it for Christmas for your friends, families, and kids, or to distract yourself from the fact
485360	490800	that there are 100 billion billion Earth-like planets in the habitable zone of Sun-like stars
490800	496640	in the observable universe, and you will never visit any of them. The last few years we've sold
496640	502880	them all, so no rush, but the clock is ticking. Getting stuff from our shop is one of the best
502880	508320	ways to support Kurzgesagt. Because of you, we can keep this channel free for everyone
508320	520160	and make more beautiful things. A happy interstellar year 12,020.
