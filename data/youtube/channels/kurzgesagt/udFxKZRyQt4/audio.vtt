00:00.720 --> 00:05.920
Neutron stars are one of the most extreme and violent things in the universe.

00:07.280 --> 00:11.440
Giant atomic nuclei only a few kilometers in diameter,

00:11.440 --> 00:17.680
but as massive as stars. And they owe their existence to the death of something majestic.

00:18.400 --> 00:36.800
Stars exist because of a fragile balance. The mass of millions of billions of trillions of tons of

00:36.800 --> 00:42.720
hot plasma are being pulled inwards by gravity and squeezed material together with so much force

00:42.720 --> 00:50.560
that nuclei fuse. Hydrogen fuses into helium. This releases energy which pushes against gravity

00:50.560 --> 00:55.600
and tries to escape. As long as this balance exists, stars are pretty stable.

00:56.880 --> 01:03.200
Eventually, the hydrogen will be exhausted. Medium stars like our sun go through a giant

01:03.200 --> 01:08.240
phase where they burn helium into carbon and oxygen before they eventually turn into white

01:08.240 --> 01:14.480
dwarfs. But in stars many times the mass of our sun, things get interesting when the helium is

01:14.480 --> 01:21.200
exhausted. For a moment, the balance of pressure and radiation tips and gravity wins, squeezing the

01:21.200 --> 01:26.720
star tighter than before. The core burns hotter and faster, while the outer layers of the star

01:26.720 --> 01:33.600
swell by hundreds of times, fusing heavier and heavier elements. Carbon burns to neon in centuries,

01:33.600 --> 01:41.280
neon to oxygen in a year, oxygen to silicon in months, and silicon to iron in a day. And then,

01:42.080 --> 01:50.000
death. Iron is nuclear ash. It has no energy to give and cannot be fused. The fusion suddenly

01:50.000 --> 01:55.600
stops and the balance ends. Without the outward pressure from fusion, the core is crushed by the

01:55.600 --> 02:03.120
enormous weight of the star above it. What happens now is awesome and scary. Particles like

02:03.200 --> 02:08.320
electrons and protons really don't want to be near each other. But the pressure of the collapsing star

02:08.320 --> 02:14.160
is so great that electrons and protons fuse into neutrons, which then get squeezed together as

02:14.160 --> 02:21.040
tightly as in atomic nuclei. An iron ball the size of the earth is squeezed into a ball of pure

02:21.040 --> 02:27.440
nuclear matter the size of a city. But not just the core, the whole star implodes, gravity pulling

02:27.440 --> 02:34.880
the outer layers in at 25% the speed of light. This implosion bounces off the iron core, producing

02:34.880 --> 02:41.360
a shockwave that explodes outwards and catapults the rest of the star into space. This is what we

02:41.360 --> 02:49.440
call a supernova explosion, and it will outshine entire galaxies. What remains of the star is now

02:49.440 --> 02:54.480
a neutron star. Its mass is around a million times the mass of the earth, but compressed

02:54.480 --> 03:01.040
to an object about 25 kilometers wide. It's so dense that the mass of all living humans would

03:01.040 --> 03:07.520
fit into one cubic centimeter of neutron star matter. That's roughly a billion tons in a space

03:07.520 --> 03:13.200
the size of a sugar cube. Put another way, that's Mount Everest in a cup of coffee.

03:14.400 --> 03:20.720
From the outside, a neutron star is unbelievably extreme. Its gravity is the strongest outside

03:20.720 --> 03:26.720
black holes, and if it were any denser, it would become one. Light is bent around it,

03:26.720 --> 03:32.320
meaning you can see the front and parts of the back. Their surfaces reach a million degrees

03:32.320 --> 03:39.280
Celsius compared to a measly 6000 degrees for our sun. Okay, let's look inside a neutron star.

03:39.920 --> 03:45.520
Although these giant atomic nuclei are stars, in many ways they're also like planets with

03:45.520 --> 03:52.240
solid crusts over a liquid core. The crust is extremely hard. The outermost layers are made

03:52.240 --> 03:57.120
of iron leftover from the supernova squeezed together in a crystal lattice with a sea of

03:57.120 --> 04:02.960
electrons flowing through them. Going deeper, gravity squeezes nuclei closer together.

04:03.520 --> 04:10.560
We find fewer and fewer protons as most merged to neutrons until we reach the base of the crust.

04:10.560 --> 04:14.400
Here, nuclei are squeezed together so hard that they start to touch.

04:15.040 --> 04:20.560
Protons and neutrons rearrange, making long cylinders or sheets, enormous nuclei with

04:20.560 --> 04:25.840
millions of protons and neutrons shaped like spaghetti and lasagna, which physicists call

04:25.840 --> 04:32.400
nuclear pasta. Nuclear pasta is so dense that it may be the strongest material in the universe,

04:32.400 --> 04:39.040
basically unbreakable. Lumps of pasta inside a neutron star can even make mountains, at most a

04:39.040 --> 04:45.840
few centimeters high, but many times as massive as the Himalayas. Eventually, beneath the pasta,

04:45.840 --> 04:50.800
we reach the core. We're not really sure what the properties of matter are when they're squeezed

04:50.800 --> 04:56.400
this hard. Protons and neutrons might dissolve into an ocean of quarks, a so-called quark gluon

04:56.400 --> 05:02.800
plasma. Some of those quarks might turn into strange quarks, making a sort of strange matter,

05:02.800 --> 05:08.320
with properties so extreme that we made a whole video about it. Or maybe they just stay protons

05:08.320 --> 05:15.200
and neutrons. No one knows for sure, and that's why we do science. That's all pretty heavy stuff,

05:15.200 --> 05:21.920
literally, so let's go back out into space. When neutron stars first collapse, they begin to spin

05:21.920 --> 05:28.480
very, very fast, like a ballerina pulling her arms in. Neutron stars are celestial ballerinas,

05:28.480 --> 05:34.320
spinning many times per second. This creates pulses because their magnetic field creates a

05:34.320 --> 05:40.960
beam of radio waves which passes every time they spin. These radio pulsars are the best-known type

05:40.960 --> 05:48.160
of neutron star about 2,000 are known of in the Milky Way. These magnetic fields are the strongest

05:48.160 --> 05:53.840
in the universe, a quadrillion times stronger than Earth's after they're born. They're called

05:53.840 --> 06:00.000
magnetars until they calm down a little. But the absolute best kind of neutron stars are friends

06:00.000 --> 06:06.480
with other neutron stars. By radiating away energy as gravitational waves ripples in space-time,

06:06.480 --> 06:12.400
their orbits can decay and they can crash into and kill each other in a kilonova explosion that spews

06:12.400 --> 06:18.320
out a lot of their guts. When they do, the conditions become so extreme that for a moment

06:18.320 --> 06:24.080
heavy nuclei are made again. It's not fusion putting nuclei together this time, but heavy

06:24.080 --> 06:30.800
neutron-rich matter falling apart and reassembling. Only very recently, we've learned that this is

06:30.800 --> 06:36.720
probably the origin of most of the heavy elements in the universe, like gold, uranium, and platinum,

06:36.720 --> 06:42.720
and dozens more. So there now two neutron stars collapse and become a black hole,

06:42.720 --> 06:49.360
dying yet again. Not only do stars have to die to create elements, they have to die twice.

06:49.360 --> 06:56.400
Over millions of years, these atoms will mix back into the galaxy, but some of them end up in a

06:56.400 --> 07:02.880
cloud which gravity pulls together to form stars and planets, repeating the cycle. Our solar system

07:02.880 --> 07:07.840
is one example, and the remains of those neutron stars that came before us are all around us.

07:08.960 --> 07:14.720
Our entire technological modern world was built out of the elements neutron stars made in eons

07:14.720 --> 07:21.600
past, sending these atoms on a 13 billion year journey to come together and make us and our world.

07:22.560 --> 07:31.280
And that's pretty cool. Until then, we can look at them on paper. The 12,020 human space

07:31.280 --> 07:38.480
era calendar has arrived. You can order it now until we sell out, and then never again. Visit

07:38.480 --> 07:45.120
the cloudy cities of Venus, Dyson swarm assembly on Mercury, and cross the borders of our solar

07:45.120 --> 07:52.080
system. Shipping from the US and from Europe for the first time, but we deliver to every country

07:52.080 --> 07:58.960
all over the world. You can also get a plushie or hoodie or poster. We have some sweet deals for you.

07:59.840 --> 08:05.360
Get it for Christmas for your friends, families, and kids, or to distract yourself from the fact

08:05.360 --> 08:10.800
that there are 100 billion billion Earth-like planets in the habitable zone of Sun-like stars

08:10.800 --> 08:16.640
in the observable universe, and you will never visit any of them. The last few years we've sold

08:16.640 --> 08:22.880
them all, so no rush, but the clock is ticking. Getting stuff from our shop is one of the best

08:22.880 --> 08:28.320
ways to support Kurzgesagt. Because of you, we can keep this channel free for everyone

08:28.320 --> 08:40.160
and make more beautiful things. A happy interstellar year 12,020.
