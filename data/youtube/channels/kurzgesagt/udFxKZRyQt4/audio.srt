1
00:00:00,720 --> 00:00:05,920
Neutron stars are one of the most extreme and violent things in the universe.

2
00:00:07,280 --> 00:00:11,440
Giant atomic nuclei only a few kilometers in diameter,

3
00:00:11,440 --> 00:00:17,680
but as massive as stars. And they owe their existence to the death of something majestic.

4
00:00:18,400 --> 00:00:36,800
Stars exist because of a fragile balance. The mass of millions of billions of trillions of tons of

5
00:00:36,800 --> 00:00:42,720
hot plasma are being pulled inwards by gravity and squeezed material together with so much force

6
00:00:42,720 --> 00:00:50,560
that nuclei fuse. Hydrogen fuses into helium. This releases energy which pushes against gravity

7
00:00:50,560 --> 00:00:55,600
and tries to escape. As long as this balance exists, stars are pretty stable.

8
00:00:56,880 --> 00:01:03,200
Eventually, the hydrogen will be exhausted. Medium stars like our sun go through a giant

9
00:01:03,200 --> 00:01:08,240
phase where they burn helium into carbon and oxygen before they eventually turn into white

10
00:01:08,240 --> 00:01:14,480
dwarfs. But in stars many times the mass of our sun, things get interesting when the helium is

11
00:01:14,480 --> 00:01:21,200
exhausted. For a moment, the balance of pressure and radiation tips and gravity wins, squeezing the

12
00:01:21,200 --> 00:01:26,720
star tighter than before. The core burns hotter and faster, while the outer layers of the star

13
00:01:26,720 --> 00:01:33,600
swell by hundreds of times, fusing heavier and heavier elements. Carbon burns to neon in centuries,

14
00:01:33,600 --> 00:01:41,280
neon to oxygen in a year, oxygen to silicon in months, and silicon to iron in a day. And then,

15
00:01:42,080 --> 00:01:50,000
death. Iron is nuclear ash. It has no energy to give and cannot be fused. The fusion suddenly

16
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:55,600
stops and the balance ends. Without the outward pressure from fusion, the core is crushed by the

17
00:01:55,600 --> 00:02:03,120
enormous weight of the star above it. What happens now is awesome and scary. Particles like

18
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:08,320
electrons and protons really don't want to be near each other. But the pressure of the collapsing star

19
00:02:08,320 --> 00:02:14,160
is so great that electrons and protons fuse into neutrons, which then get squeezed together as

20
00:02:14,160 --> 00:02:21,040
tightly as in atomic nuclei. An iron ball the size of the earth is squeezed into a ball of pure

21
00:02:21,040 --> 00:02:27,440
nuclear matter the size of a city. But not just the core, the whole star implodes, gravity pulling

22
00:02:27,440 --> 00:02:34,880
the outer layers in at 25% the speed of light. This implosion bounces off the iron core, producing

23
00:02:34,880 --> 00:02:41,360
a shockwave that explodes outwards and catapults the rest of the star into space. This is what we

24
00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:49,440
call a supernova explosion, and it will outshine entire galaxies. What remains of the star is now

25
00:02:49,440 --> 00:02:54,480
a neutron star. Its mass is around a million times the mass of the earth, but compressed

26
00:02:54,480 --> 00:03:01,040
to an object about 25 kilometers wide. It's so dense that the mass of all living humans would

27
00:03:01,040 --> 00:03:07,520
fit into one cubic centimeter of neutron star matter. That's roughly a billion tons in a space

28
00:03:07,520 --> 00:03:13,200
the size of a sugar cube. Put another way, that's Mount Everest in a cup of coffee.

29
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:20,720
From the outside, a neutron star is unbelievably extreme. Its gravity is the strongest outside

30
00:03:20,720 --> 00:03:26,720
black holes, and if it were any denser, it would become one. Light is bent around it,

31
00:03:26,720 --> 00:03:32,320
meaning you can see the front and parts of the back. Their surfaces reach a million degrees

32
00:03:32,320 --> 00:03:39,280
Celsius compared to a measly 6000 degrees for our sun. Okay, let's look inside a neutron star.

33
00:03:39,920 --> 00:03:45,520
Although these giant atomic nuclei are stars, in many ways they're also like planets with

34
00:03:45,520 --> 00:03:52,240
solid crusts over a liquid core. The crust is extremely hard. The outermost layers are made

35
00:03:52,240 --> 00:03:57,120
of iron leftover from the supernova squeezed together in a crystal lattice with a sea of

36
00:03:57,120 --> 00:04:02,960
electrons flowing through them. Going deeper, gravity squeezes nuclei closer together.

37
00:04:03,520 --> 00:04:10,560
We find fewer and fewer protons as most merged to neutrons until we reach the base of the crust.

38
00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:14,400
Here, nuclei are squeezed together so hard that they start to touch.

39
00:04:15,040 --> 00:04:20,560
Protons and neutrons rearrange, making long cylinders or sheets, enormous nuclei with

40
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:25,840
millions of protons and neutrons shaped like spaghetti and lasagna, which physicists call

41
00:04:25,840 --> 00:04:32,400
nuclear pasta. Nuclear pasta is so dense that it may be the strongest material in the universe,

42
00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:39,040
basically unbreakable. Lumps of pasta inside a neutron star can even make mountains, at most a

43
00:04:39,040 --> 00:04:45,840
few centimeters high, but many times as massive as the Himalayas. Eventually, beneath the pasta,

44
00:04:45,840 --> 00:04:50,800
we reach the core. We're not really sure what the properties of matter are when they're squeezed

45
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:56,400
this hard. Protons and neutrons might dissolve into an ocean of quarks, a so-called quark gluon

46
00:04:56,400 --> 00:05:02,800
plasma. Some of those quarks might turn into strange quarks, making a sort of strange matter,

47
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:08,320
with properties so extreme that we made a whole video about it. Or maybe they just stay protons

48
00:05:08,320 --> 00:05:15,200
and neutrons. No one knows for sure, and that's why we do science. That's all pretty heavy stuff,

49
00:05:15,200 --> 00:05:21,920
literally, so let's go back out into space. When neutron stars first collapse, they begin to spin

50
00:05:21,920 --> 00:05:28,480
very, very fast, like a ballerina pulling her arms in. Neutron stars are celestial ballerinas,

51
00:05:28,480 --> 00:05:34,320
spinning many times per second. This creates pulses because their magnetic field creates a

52
00:05:34,320 --> 00:05:40,960
beam of radio waves which passes every time they spin. These radio pulsars are the best-known type

53
00:05:40,960 --> 00:05:48,160
of neutron star about 2,000 are known of in the Milky Way. These magnetic fields are the strongest

54
00:05:48,160 --> 00:05:53,840
in the universe, a quadrillion times stronger than Earth's after they're born. They're called

55
00:05:53,840 --> 00:06:00,000
magnetars until they calm down a little. But the absolute best kind of neutron stars are friends

56
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:06,480
with other neutron stars. By radiating away energy as gravitational waves ripples in space-time,

57
00:06:06,480 --> 00:06:12,400
their orbits can decay and they can crash into and kill each other in a kilonova explosion that spews

58
00:06:12,400 --> 00:06:18,320
out a lot of their guts. When they do, the conditions become so extreme that for a moment

59
00:06:18,320 --> 00:06:24,080
heavy nuclei are made again. It's not fusion putting nuclei together this time, but heavy

60
00:06:24,080 --> 00:06:30,800
neutron-rich matter falling apart and reassembling. Only very recently, we've learned that this is

61
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:36,720
probably the origin of most of the heavy elements in the universe, like gold, uranium, and platinum,

62
00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:42,720
and dozens more. So there now two neutron stars collapse and become a black hole,

63
00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:49,360
dying yet again. Not only do stars have to die to create elements, they have to die twice.

64
00:06:49,360 --> 00:06:56,400
Over millions of years, these atoms will mix back into the galaxy, but some of them end up in a

65
00:06:56,400 --> 00:07:02,880
cloud which gravity pulls together to form stars and planets, repeating the cycle. Our solar system

66
00:07:02,880 --> 00:07:07,840
is one example, and the remains of those neutron stars that came before us are all around us.

67
00:07:08,960 --> 00:07:14,720
Our entire technological modern world was built out of the elements neutron stars made in eons

68
00:07:14,720 --> 00:07:21,600
past, sending these atoms on a 13 billion year journey to come together and make us and our world.

69
00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:31,280
And that's pretty cool. Until then, we can look at them on paper. The 12,020 human space

70
00:07:31,280 --> 00:07:38,480
era calendar has arrived. You can order it now until we sell out, and then never again. Visit

71
00:07:38,480 --> 00:07:45,120
the cloudy cities of Venus, Dyson swarm assembly on Mercury, and cross the borders of our solar

72
00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:52,080
system. Shipping from the US and from Europe for the first time, but we deliver to every country

73
00:07:52,080 --> 00:07:58,960
all over the world. You can also get a plushie or hoodie or poster. We have some sweet deals for you.

74
00:07:59,840 --> 00:08:05,360
Get it for Christmas for your friends, families, and kids, or to distract yourself from the fact

75
00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:10,800
that there are 100 billion billion Earth-like planets in the habitable zone of Sun-like stars

76
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:16,640
in the observable universe, and you will never visit any of them. The last few years we've sold

77
00:08:16,640 --> 00:08:22,880
them all, so no rush, but the clock is ticking. Getting stuff from our shop is one of the best

78
00:08:22,880 --> 00:08:28,320
ways to support Kurzgesagt. Because of you, we can keep this channel free for everyone

79
00:08:28,320 --> 00:08:40,160
and make more beautiful things. A happy interstellar year 12,020.
