1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,560
Ah, casually watching a video on YouTube on a computer more powerful than anything humanity

2
00:00:06,560 --> 00:00:08,760
could build a few decades ago.

3
00:00:08,760 --> 00:00:13,140
This progress and all the wonderful machines you take for granted are built on a few rare

4
00:00:13,140 --> 00:00:18,440
and precious materials with names like Terbium, Neodymium, or Tantalum.

5
00:00:18,440 --> 00:00:23,040
Getting these rare materials from the ground into your devices is ugly.

6
00:00:23,040 --> 00:00:27,000
The mining industry is responsible for air and water pollution and the destruction of

7
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:28,760
entire landscapes.

8
00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:33,640
Dangerous chemicals like cyanide, sulfuric acid, or chlorine are used to extract the

9
00:00:33,640 --> 00:00:38,120
resources, harming biodiversity, workers, and locals.

10
00:00:38,120 --> 00:00:42,500
And rare resources are also political tools when countries restrict access to them to

11
00:00:42,500 --> 00:00:44,160
get their way.

12
00:00:44,160 --> 00:00:48,880
But what if we could replace the mining industry on Earth with a clean process that can't

13
00:00:48,880 --> 00:00:49,880
harm anyone?

14
00:00:49,880 --> 00:00:52,000
Well, we can.

15
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,120
All we need to do is look up.

16
00:00:58,760 --> 00:01:08,040
Asteroids are millions of trillions of tons of rocks, metals, and ice, leftovers from

17
00:01:08,040 --> 00:01:12,080
the cloud that became the planets 4.5 billion years ago.

18
00:01:12,080 --> 00:01:17,080
They can be as small as a meter, or protoplanets the size of entire countries.

19
00:01:17,080 --> 00:01:21,000
Most of them are concentrated in the asteroid belt and the Kuiper belt, while hundreds of

20
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:24,400
thousands more do their own thing between the planets.

21
00:01:24,400 --> 00:01:28,820
As space travel is becoming more feasible, scientists and economists have begun looking

22
00:01:28,820 --> 00:01:31,960
at the resources found in these asteroids.

23
00:01:31,960 --> 00:01:36,680
Even relatively small metallic asteroids may contain trillions worth of industrial and

24
00:01:36,680 --> 00:01:39,040
precious metals like platinum.

25
00:01:39,040 --> 00:01:44,040
And bigger asteroids like 16 Psyche could contain enough iron-nickel to cover the world's

26
00:01:44,040 --> 00:01:46,640
metal needs for millions of years.

27
00:01:46,640 --> 00:01:51,960
At current market prices, the rare raw materials alone would be worth quadrillions of dollars.

28
00:01:52,400 --> 00:01:55,160
Well, not really, but technically.

29
00:01:55,160 --> 00:01:59,800
For example, there are more than 20 million tons of gold in the ocean's water worth

30
00:01:59,800 --> 00:02:02,800
roughly 750 trillion US dollars.

31
00:02:02,800 --> 00:02:07,600
But filtering out the gold would be so expensive that you'd lose money selling it.

32
00:02:07,600 --> 00:02:10,820
Right now, asteroid mining has exactly this problem.

33
00:02:10,820 --> 00:02:13,960
It's too expensive to replace mining on Earth.

34
00:02:13,960 --> 00:02:18,580
Billions of dollars worth of valuable resources in space are worthless if it costs trillions

35
00:02:18,580 --> 00:02:19,880
to get them.

36
00:02:19,880 --> 00:02:22,000
What makes it so hard?

37
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,760
The principles behind mining an asteroid are simple.

38
00:02:24,760 --> 00:02:29,040
The basic idea is to choose an asteroid, move it to a place where it's easy to process,

39
00:02:29,040 --> 00:02:32,120
and then take it apart to turn into useful products.

40
00:02:32,120 --> 00:02:37,280
Unfortunately, all of this collides with fundamental problems humans have yet to solve.

41
00:02:37,280 --> 00:02:39,240
Going to space is expensive.

42
00:02:39,240 --> 00:02:44,320
It costs thousands of dollars in rocket fuel for each kilogram just to reach a low Earth

43
00:02:44,320 --> 00:02:45,460
orbit.

44
00:02:45,460 --> 00:02:49,400
Going further out into deep space costs thousands more.

45
00:02:49,400 --> 00:02:53,480
We need cheaper space travel to make asteroid mining profitable.

46
00:02:53,480 --> 00:02:58,140
One solution is to switch from classical rockets to electric spaceships.

47
00:02:58,140 --> 00:03:02,800
We already use electrical rocket engines for many of the space probes on science missions.

48
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:05,760
In principle, we only need to build bigger ones.

49
00:03:05,760 --> 00:03:09,960
While electrical engines are not powerful enough to fly to space, they require only

50
00:03:09,960 --> 00:03:14,400
a tiny amount of fuel to go very far once they're in space.

51
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:18,880
This means we don't need to spend a lot of money on fuel only to transport fuel into

52
00:03:18,880 --> 00:03:20,200
space.

53
00:03:20,200 --> 00:03:24,560
This doesn't solve the whole cost problem, but it makes it easier to start our first

54
00:03:24,560 --> 00:03:25,560
mission.

55
00:03:25,560 --> 00:03:29,540
Now that we have an electric asteroid mining spaceship, we need to find the right asteroid

56
00:03:29,540 --> 00:03:31,080
and get it there.

57
00:03:31,080 --> 00:03:35,960
We've already successfully visited asteroids with space probes and even collected samples.

58
00:03:35,960 --> 00:03:41,360
Still, to make it easier and cheaper, our first targets will probably be near-Earth

59
00:03:41,360 --> 00:03:42,360
asteroids.

60
00:03:42,360 --> 00:03:45,580
Asteroids that orbit, well, near Earth.

61
00:03:45,580 --> 00:03:49,760
After a few months of travel, our spaceship finally arrives at our asteroid.

62
00:03:49,760 --> 00:03:54,140
Weirdly formed, littered with small impact craters, it hasn't changed much for billions

63
00:03:54,140 --> 00:03:55,420
of years.

64
00:03:55,420 --> 00:04:00,200
The first thing that needs to be done is to secure the asteroid and stop it from spinning.

65
00:04:00,200 --> 00:04:04,840
There are multiple ways to do this, like vaporizing material with a laser or stopping the rotation

66
00:04:04,840 --> 00:04:06,560
with thrusters.

67
00:04:06,560 --> 00:04:09,660
Once we have a stable asteroid, we need to wait.

68
00:04:09,660 --> 00:04:13,140
Orbital mechanics are complicated, but if you push something in the right direction

69
00:04:13,140 --> 00:04:18,260
at exactly the right moment, you can move very big things with very little force.

70
00:04:18,260 --> 00:04:22,080
So we wait for exactly the right moment.

71
00:04:22,080 --> 00:04:27,180
Our ship fires its thrusters and nudges the asteroid into a trajectory that takes it near

72
00:04:27,180 --> 00:04:28,380
our moon.

73
00:04:28,380 --> 00:04:32,520
The moon is useful because we can borrow its gravitational pull to put the asteroid in

74
00:04:32,520 --> 00:04:36,380
a stable orbit around Earth, which saves even more fuel.

75
00:04:36,380 --> 00:04:38,800
Again, the trip takes months.

76
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:42,220
But all the time since our ship was launched has not been wasted.

77
00:04:42,220 --> 00:04:47,040
The first space mining and processing equipment has been installed in orbit and is now carefully

78
00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:49,300
moving towards the asteroid.

79
00:04:49,300 --> 00:04:52,500
The processor works very differently than on Earth.

80
00:04:52,500 --> 00:04:57,480
Giant mirrors focus sunlight and heat up asteroid rock to boil out the gases.

81
00:04:57,480 --> 00:05:02,460
Grinders break up the dried rocks into gravel and dust, and centrifuges separate dents from

82
00:05:02,460 --> 00:05:04,100
light elements.

83
00:05:04,100 --> 00:05:09,820
Even if we only extract 0.01% of the asteroid's mass in precious metals, this is still several

84
00:05:09,820 --> 00:05:13,620
times more than you'd get from the same amount of ore on the ground.

85
00:05:13,620 --> 00:05:14,920
But what now?

86
00:05:14,920 --> 00:05:18,260
How do we get our precious metals safely back to ground?

87
00:05:18,260 --> 00:05:22,540
There are a few ways, like loading it into reusable rockets that return to Earth from

88
00:05:22,540 --> 00:05:23,540
space.

89
00:05:23,540 --> 00:05:28,180
Or if our processor contains 3D printers, we can print a faster and cheaper delivery

90
00:05:28,180 --> 00:05:29,180
system.

91
00:05:29,180 --> 00:05:32,500
Heat-shielded capsules filled with gas bubbles.

92
00:05:32,500 --> 00:05:36,820
These can just be dropped into the oceans, where ships tow them away.

93
00:05:36,820 --> 00:05:41,920
This could be the starting point of humanity's first real steps towards colonizing the solar

94
00:05:41,920 --> 00:05:43,380
system.

95
00:05:43,380 --> 00:05:48,980
As our infrastructure and experience grows, our missions get more and more sophisticated.

96
00:05:48,980 --> 00:05:53,060
Parts and fuel produced on asteroids don't have to be launched from Earth at all.

97
00:05:53,060 --> 00:05:57,060
The first mining operation makes the second one easier, and so on.

98
00:05:57,060 --> 00:06:01,520
While the space industry grows and precious materials become cheaper, eventually we could

99
00:06:01,520 --> 00:06:04,180
stop mining on Earth.

100
00:06:04,180 --> 00:06:09,360
Then the idea of toxic mining down here might become something weird and anachronistic like

101
00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:12,340
having an open fire in your living room.

102
00:06:12,340 --> 00:06:15,940
Landscapes ravaged by pollution will heal, while the technological wonders we're used

103
00:06:15,940 --> 00:06:19,540
to get cheaper and less toxic to make.

104
00:06:19,540 --> 00:06:21,340
None of this is science fiction.

105
00:06:21,340 --> 00:06:25,620
We don't need fancy materials or new physics to make asteroid mining happen.

106
00:06:25,620 --> 00:06:28,220
We could start building this future today.

107
00:06:28,220 --> 00:06:33,480
All we need is an initial push.

108
00:06:33,680 --> 00:06:36,040
Maybe you could also use a little nudge.

109
00:06:36,040 --> 00:06:41,400
Not to pursue anything as ambitious as asteroid mining, just to try something new and fun.

110
00:06:41,400 --> 00:06:44,320
Let us give you some tailwind there.

111
00:06:44,320 --> 00:06:48,480
We partnered with Skillshare, an online learning community with thousands of classes in all

112
00:06:48,480 --> 00:06:54,540
kinds of creative skills like graphic design, music, photography, illustration, and animation.

113
00:06:54,540 --> 00:06:58,280
They have something for every skill level, so no matter from where you're starting, there'll

114
00:06:58,280 --> 00:07:00,620
be tons of things for you to explore.

115
00:07:00,620 --> 00:07:04,040
If you'd like to take a glimpse behind the scenes of our animations, for example, we've

116
00:07:04,040 --> 00:07:08,200
made a couple of Skillshare classes that teach you how we animated scenes from our videos

117
00:07:08,200 --> 00:07:11,540
with video lessons, classes, and hands-on projects.

118
00:07:11,540 --> 00:07:15,200
Or if you'd rather come up with your own characters to breathe life into, we recommend

119
00:07:15,200 --> 00:07:20,140
Character Illustration, From Concept to Final Artwork by Matt Kaufenberg.

120
00:07:20,140 --> 00:07:24,220
But it doesn't really matter what you pick, as long as you get started, improve your skills,

121
00:07:24,220 --> 00:07:25,700
and have some fun.

122
00:07:25,700 --> 00:07:30,920
Unlimited access to all classes is only $10 a month with an annual premium membership.

123
00:07:30,920 --> 00:07:35,300
But we have a treat for the first 1000 Kurzgesagt viewers to click the link in the description.

124
00:07:35,300 --> 00:07:37,620
You'll get a two-month trial for free.

125
00:07:37,620 --> 00:07:41,900
If you want to leave your comfort zone by exploring new skills and support Kurzgesagt,

126
00:07:41,900 --> 00:07:42,900
give it a try.
