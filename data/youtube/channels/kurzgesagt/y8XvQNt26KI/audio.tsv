0	6560	Ah, casually watching a video on YouTube on a computer more powerful than anything humanity
6560	8760	could build a few decades ago.
8760	13140	This progress and all the wonderful machines you take for granted are built on a few rare
13140	18440	and precious materials with names like Terbium, Neodymium, or Tantalum.
18440	23040	Getting these rare materials from the ground into your devices is ugly.
23040	27000	The mining industry is responsible for air and water pollution and the destruction of
27000	28760	entire landscapes.
28800	33640	Dangerous chemicals like cyanide, sulfuric acid, or chlorine are used to extract the
33640	38120	resources, harming biodiversity, workers, and locals.
38120	42500	And rare resources are also political tools when countries restrict access to them to
42500	44160	get their way.
44160	48880	But what if we could replace the mining industry on Earth with a clean process that can't
48880	49880	harm anyone?
49880	52000	Well, we can.
52000	54120	All we need to do is look up.
58760	68040	Asteroids are millions of trillions of tons of rocks, metals, and ice, leftovers from
68040	72080	the cloud that became the planets 4.5 billion years ago.
72080	77080	They can be as small as a meter, or protoplanets the size of entire countries.
77080	81000	Most of them are concentrated in the asteroid belt and the Kuiper belt, while hundreds of
81000	84400	thousands more do their own thing between the planets.
84400	88820	As space travel is becoming more feasible, scientists and economists have begun looking
88820	91960	at the resources found in these asteroids.
91960	96680	Even relatively small metallic asteroids may contain trillions worth of industrial and
96680	99040	precious metals like platinum.
99040	104040	And bigger asteroids like 16 Psyche could contain enough iron-nickel to cover the world's
104040	106640	metal needs for millions of years.
106640	111960	At current market prices, the rare raw materials alone would be worth quadrillions of dollars.
112400	115160	Well, not really, but technically.
115160	119800	For example, there are more than 20 million tons of gold in the ocean's water worth
119800	122800	roughly 750 trillion US dollars.
122800	127600	But filtering out the gold would be so expensive that you'd lose money selling it.
127600	130820	Right now, asteroid mining has exactly this problem.
130820	133960	It's too expensive to replace mining on Earth.
133960	138580	Billions of dollars worth of valuable resources in space are worthless if it costs trillions
138580	139880	to get them.
139880	142000	What makes it so hard?
142000	144760	The principles behind mining an asteroid are simple.
144760	149040	The basic idea is to choose an asteroid, move it to a place where it's easy to process,
149040	152120	and then take it apart to turn into useful products.
152120	157280	Unfortunately, all of this collides with fundamental problems humans have yet to solve.
157280	159240	Going to space is expensive.
159240	164320	It costs thousands of dollars in rocket fuel for each kilogram just to reach a low Earth
164320	165460	orbit.
165460	169400	Going further out into deep space costs thousands more.
169400	173480	We need cheaper space travel to make asteroid mining profitable.
173480	178140	One solution is to switch from classical rockets to electric spaceships.
178140	182800	We already use electrical rocket engines for many of the space probes on science missions.
182800	185760	In principle, we only need to build bigger ones.
185760	189960	While electrical engines are not powerful enough to fly to space, they require only
189960	194400	a tiny amount of fuel to go very far once they're in space.
194400	198880	This means we don't need to spend a lot of money on fuel only to transport fuel into
198880	200200	space.
200200	204560	This doesn't solve the whole cost problem, but it makes it easier to start our first
204560	205560	mission.
205560	209540	Now that we have an electric asteroid mining spaceship, we need to find the right asteroid
209540	211080	and get it there.
211080	215960	We've already successfully visited asteroids with space probes and even collected samples.
215960	221360	Still, to make it easier and cheaper, our first targets will probably be near-Earth
221360	222360	asteroids.
222360	225580	Asteroids that orbit, well, near Earth.
225580	229760	After a few months of travel, our spaceship finally arrives at our asteroid.
229760	234140	Weirdly formed, littered with small impact craters, it hasn't changed much for billions
234140	235420	of years.
235420	240200	The first thing that needs to be done is to secure the asteroid and stop it from spinning.
240200	244840	There are multiple ways to do this, like vaporizing material with a laser or stopping the rotation
244840	246560	with thrusters.
246560	249660	Once we have a stable asteroid, we need to wait.
249660	253140	Orbital mechanics are complicated, but if you push something in the right direction
253140	258260	at exactly the right moment, you can move very big things with very little force.
258260	262080	So we wait for exactly the right moment.
262080	267180	Our ship fires its thrusters and nudges the asteroid into a trajectory that takes it near
267180	268380	our moon.
268380	272520	The moon is useful because we can borrow its gravitational pull to put the asteroid in
272520	276380	a stable orbit around Earth, which saves even more fuel.
276380	278800	Again, the trip takes months.
278800	282220	But all the time since our ship was launched has not been wasted.
282220	287040	The first space mining and processing equipment has been installed in orbit and is now carefully
287040	289300	moving towards the asteroid.
289300	292500	The processor works very differently than on Earth.
292500	297480	Giant mirrors focus sunlight and heat up asteroid rock to boil out the gases.
297480	302460	Grinders break up the dried rocks into gravel and dust, and centrifuges separate dents from
302460	304100	light elements.
304100	309820	Even if we only extract 0.01% of the asteroid's mass in precious metals, this is still several
309820	313620	times more than you'd get from the same amount of ore on the ground.
313620	314920	But what now?
314920	318260	How do we get our precious metals safely back to ground?
318260	322540	There are a few ways, like loading it into reusable rockets that return to Earth from
322540	323540	space.
323540	328180	Or if our processor contains 3D printers, we can print a faster and cheaper delivery
328180	329180	system.
329180	332500	Heat-shielded capsules filled with gas bubbles.
332500	336820	These can just be dropped into the oceans, where ships tow them away.
336820	341920	This could be the starting point of humanity's first real steps towards colonizing the solar
341920	343380	system.
343380	348980	As our infrastructure and experience grows, our missions get more and more sophisticated.
348980	353060	Parts and fuel produced on asteroids don't have to be launched from Earth at all.
353060	357060	The first mining operation makes the second one easier, and so on.
357060	361520	While the space industry grows and precious materials become cheaper, eventually we could
361520	364180	stop mining on Earth.
364180	369360	Then the idea of toxic mining down here might become something weird and anachronistic like
369360	372340	having an open fire in your living room.
372340	375940	Landscapes ravaged by pollution will heal, while the technological wonders we're used
375940	379540	to get cheaper and less toxic to make.
379540	381340	None of this is science fiction.
381340	385620	We don't need fancy materials or new physics to make asteroid mining happen.
385620	388220	We could start building this future today.
388220	393480	All we need is an initial push.
393680	396040	Maybe you could also use a little nudge.
396040	401400	Not to pursue anything as ambitious as asteroid mining, just to try something new and fun.
401400	404320	Let us give you some tailwind there.
404320	408480	We partnered with Skillshare, an online learning community with thousands of classes in all
