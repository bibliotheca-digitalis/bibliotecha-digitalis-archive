00:00.000 --> 00:06.560
Ah, casually watching a video on YouTube on a computer more powerful than anything humanity

00:06.560 --> 00:08.760
could build a few decades ago.

00:08.760 --> 00:13.140
This progress and all the wonderful machines you take for granted are built on a few rare

00:13.140 --> 00:18.440
and precious materials with names like Terbium, Neodymium, or Tantalum.

00:18.440 --> 00:23.040
Getting these rare materials from the ground into your devices is ugly.

00:23.040 --> 00:27.000
The mining industry is responsible for air and water pollution and the destruction of

00:27.000 --> 00:28.760
entire landscapes.

00:28.800 --> 00:33.640
Dangerous chemicals like cyanide, sulfuric acid, or chlorine are used to extract the

00:33.640 --> 00:38.120
resources, harming biodiversity, workers, and locals.

00:38.120 --> 00:42.500
And rare resources are also political tools when countries restrict access to them to

00:42.500 --> 00:44.160
get their way.

00:44.160 --> 00:48.880
But what if we could replace the mining industry on Earth with a clean process that can't

00:48.880 --> 00:49.880
harm anyone?

00:49.880 --> 00:52.000
Well, we can.

00:52.000 --> 00:54.120
All we need to do is look up.

00:58.760 --> 01:08.040
Asteroids are millions of trillions of tons of rocks, metals, and ice, leftovers from

01:08.040 --> 01:12.080
the cloud that became the planets 4.5 billion years ago.

01:12.080 --> 01:17.080
They can be as small as a meter, or protoplanets the size of entire countries.

01:17.080 --> 01:21.000
Most of them are concentrated in the asteroid belt and the Kuiper belt, while hundreds of

01:21.000 --> 01:24.400
thousands more do their own thing between the planets.

01:24.400 --> 01:28.820
As space travel is becoming more feasible, scientists and economists have begun looking

01:28.820 --> 01:31.960
at the resources found in these asteroids.

01:31.960 --> 01:36.680
Even relatively small metallic asteroids may contain trillions worth of industrial and

01:36.680 --> 01:39.040
precious metals like platinum.

01:39.040 --> 01:44.040
And bigger asteroids like 16 Psyche could contain enough iron-nickel to cover the world's

01:44.040 --> 01:46.640
metal needs for millions of years.

01:46.640 --> 01:51.960
At current market prices, the rare raw materials alone would be worth quadrillions of dollars.

01:52.400 --> 01:55.160
Well, not really, but technically.

01:55.160 --> 01:59.800
For example, there are more than 20 million tons of gold in the ocean's water worth

01:59.800 --> 02:02.800
roughly 750 trillion US dollars.

02:02.800 --> 02:07.600
But filtering out the gold would be so expensive that you'd lose money selling it.

02:07.600 --> 02:10.820
Right now, asteroid mining has exactly this problem.

02:10.820 --> 02:13.960
It's too expensive to replace mining on Earth.

02:13.960 --> 02:18.580
Billions of dollars worth of valuable resources in space are worthless if it costs trillions

02:18.580 --> 02:19.880
to get them.

02:19.880 --> 02:22.000
What makes it so hard?

02:22.000 --> 02:24.760
The principles behind mining an asteroid are simple.

02:24.760 --> 02:29.040
The basic idea is to choose an asteroid, move it to a place where it's easy to process,

02:29.040 --> 02:32.120
and then take it apart to turn into useful products.

02:32.120 --> 02:37.280
Unfortunately, all of this collides with fundamental problems humans have yet to solve.

02:37.280 --> 02:39.240
Going to space is expensive.

02:39.240 --> 02:44.320
It costs thousands of dollars in rocket fuel for each kilogram just to reach a low Earth

02:44.320 --> 02:45.460
orbit.

02:45.460 --> 02:49.400
Going further out into deep space costs thousands more.

02:49.400 --> 02:53.480
We need cheaper space travel to make asteroid mining profitable.

02:53.480 --> 02:58.140
One solution is to switch from classical rockets to electric spaceships.

02:58.140 --> 03:02.800
We already use electrical rocket engines for many of the space probes on science missions.

03:02.800 --> 03:05.760
In principle, we only need to build bigger ones.

03:05.760 --> 03:09.960
While electrical engines are not powerful enough to fly to space, they require only

03:09.960 --> 03:14.400
a tiny amount of fuel to go very far once they're in space.

03:14.400 --> 03:18.880
This means we don't need to spend a lot of money on fuel only to transport fuel into

03:18.880 --> 03:20.200
space.

03:20.200 --> 03:24.560
This doesn't solve the whole cost problem, but it makes it easier to start our first

03:24.560 --> 03:25.560
mission.

03:25.560 --> 03:29.540
Now that we have an electric asteroid mining spaceship, we need to find the right asteroid

03:29.540 --> 03:31.080
and get it there.

03:31.080 --> 03:35.960
We've already successfully visited asteroids with space probes and even collected samples.

03:35.960 --> 03:41.360
Still, to make it easier and cheaper, our first targets will probably be near-Earth

03:41.360 --> 03:42.360
asteroids.

03:42.360 --> 03:45.580
Asteroids that orbit, well, near Earth.

03:45.580 --> 03:49.760
After a few months of travel, our spaceship finally arrives at our asteroid.

03:49.760 --> 03:54.140
Weirdly formed, littered with small impact craters, it hasn't changed much for billions

03:54.140 --> 03:55.420
of years.

03:55.420 --> 04:00.200
The first thing that needs to be done is to secure the asteroid and stop it from spinning.

04:00.200 --> 04:04.840
There are multiple ways to do this, like vaporizing material with a laser or stopping the rotation

04:04.840 --> 04:06.560
with thrusters.

04:06.560 --> 04:09.660
Once we have a stable asteroid, we need to wait.

04:09.660 --> 04:13.140
Orbital mechanics are complicated, but if you push something in the right direction

04:13.140 --> 04:18.260
at exactly the right moment, you can move very big things with very little force.

04:18.260 --> 04:22.080
So we wait for exactly the right moment.

04:22.080 --> 04:27.180
Our ship fires its thrusters and nudges the asteroid into a trajectory that takes it near

04:27.180 --> 04:28.380
our moon.

04:28.380 --> 04:32.520
The moon is useful because we can borrow its gravitational pull to put the asteroid in

04:32.520 --> 04:36.380
a stable orbit around Earth, which saves even more fuel.

04:36.380 --> 04:38.800
Again, the trip takes months.

04:38.800 --> 04:42.220
But all the time since our ship was launched has not been wasted.

04:42.220 --> 04:47.040
The first space mining and processing equipment has been installed in orbit and is now carefully

04:47.040 --> 04:49.300
moving towards the asteroid.

04:49.300 --> 04:52.500
The processor works very differently than on Earth.

04:52.500 --> 04:57.480
Giant mirrors focus sunlight and heat up asteroid rock to boil out the gases.

04:57.480 --> 05:02.460
Grinders break up the dried rocks into gravel and dust, and centrifuges separate dents from

05:02.460 --> 05:04.100
light elements.

05:04.100 --> 05:09.820
Even if we only extract 0.01% of the asteroid's mass in precious metals, this is still several

05:09.820 --> 05:13.620
times more than you'd get from the same amount of ore on the ground.

05:13.620 --> 05:14.920
But what now?

05:14.920 --> 05:18.260
How do we get our precious metals safely back to ground?

05:18.260 --> 05:22.540
There are a few ways, like loading it into reusable rockets that return to Earth from

05:22.540 --> 05:23.540
space.

05:23.540 --> 05:28.180
Or if our processor contains 3D printers, we can print a faster and cheaper delivery

05:28.180 --> 05:29.180
system.

05:29.180 --> 05:32.500
Heat-shielded capsules filled with gas bubbles.

05:32.500 --> 05:36.820
These can just be dropped into the oceans, where ships tow them away.

05:36.820 --> 05:41.920
This could be the starting point of humanity's first real steps towards colonizing the solar

05:41.920 --> 05:43.380
system.

05:43.380 --> 05:48.980
As our infrastructure and experience grows, our missions get more and more sophisticated.

05:48.980 --> 05:53.060
Parts and fuel produced on asteroids don't have to be launched from Earth at all.

05:53.060 --> 05:57.060
The first mining operation makes the second one easier, and so on.

05:57.060 --> 06:01.520
While the space industry grows and precious materials become cheaper, eventually we could

06:01.520 --> 06:04.180
stop mining on Earth.

06:04.180 --> 06:09.360
Then the idea of toxic mining down here might become something weird and anachronistic like

06:09.360 --> 06:12.340
having an open fire in your living room.

06:12.340 --> 06:15.940
Landscapes ravaged by pollution will heal, while the technological wonders we're used

06:15.940 --> 06:19.540
to get cheaper and less toxic to make.

06:19.540 --> 06:21.340
None of this is science fiction.

06:21.340 --> 06:25.620
We don't need fancy materials or new physics to make asteroid mining happen.

06:25.620 --> 06:28.220
We could start building this future today.

06:28.220 --> 06:33.480
All we need is an initial push.

06:33.680 --> 06:36.040
Maybe you could also use a little nudge.

06:36.040 --> 06:41.400
Not to pursue anything as ambitious as asteroid mining, just to try something new and fun.

06:41.400 --> 06:44.320
Let us give you some tailwind there.

06:44.320 --> 06:48.480
We partnered with Skillshare, an online learning community with thousands of classes in all

06:48.480 --> 06:54.540
kinds of creative skills like graphic design, music, photography, illustration, and animation.

06:54.540 --> 06:58.280
They have something for every skill level, so no matter from where you're starting, there'll

06:58.280 --> 07:00.620
be tons of things for you to explore.

07:00.620 --> 07:04.040
If you'd like to take a glimpse behind the scenes of our animations, for example, we've

07:04.040 --> 07:08.200
made a couple of Skillshare classes that teach you how we animated scenes from our videos

07:08.200 --> 07:11.540
with video lessons, classes, and hands-on projects.

07:11.540 --> 07:15.200
Or if you'd rather come up with your own characters to breathe life into, we recommend

07:15.200 --> 07:20.140
Character Illustration, From Concept to Final Artwork by Matt Kaufenberg.

07:20.140 --> 07:24.220
But it doesn't really matter what you pick, as long as you get started, improve your skills,

07:24.220 --> 07:25.700
and have some fun.

07:25.700 --> 07:30.920
Unlimited access to all classes is only $10 a month with an annual premium membership.

07:30.920 --> 07:35.300
