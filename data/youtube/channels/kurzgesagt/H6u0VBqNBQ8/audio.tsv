0	4000	Consciousness is perhaps the biggest riddle in nature.
4000	13000	Stripped to its core meaning, consciousness is what allows us to be aware both of our surroundings and of our own inner state.
13000	19000	But thinking about consciousness has this habit of taking us round in circles.
19000	24000	We all intuitively know what consciousness is, it's this.
24000	28000	It's what you're experiencing here, right now.
28000	34000	But once we try to pinpoint just what exactly it is, it leaves us grasping at thin air.
34000	36000	And not just us.
36000	40000	Philosophers and scientists struggle to define consciousness.
40000	47000	Different schools and ideas compete with one another, but no one has come close to figuring it out.
47000	54000	It's unsettling to realize that we don't understand what makes us aware of ourselves and the world.
54000	61000	In this fuzzy area, consciousness and intelligence are also related, although they are not the same.
61000	66000	We'll talk in greater depth about theories of consciousness and intelligence in other videos.
66000	76000	Like much of what makes us human, our consciousness is likely to have evolved from less complex forms as a product of evolution by natural selection.
77000	87000	It has probably emerged from an immense several hundred million year sequence of countless microsteps that together make up a sort of gradient of consciousness.
87000	98000	What was the first step on this path from the non-conscious to the basic consciousness that ultimately led to the convoluted consciousness we humans enjoy today?
107000	117000	Take a stone. The consensus is that a stone is not conscious, though not everyone agrees even on this.
117000	122000	Some panpsychists claim that a lump of rock may have an inner life.
122000	129000	However, there are no real grounds for any such assumption, since stones never show behavior.
129000	133000	Their inner life can neither be proven nor disproven.
134000	137000	A more common starting point is with living things.
137000	144000	A living thing, or a self, is a part of the universe that sustains itself and makes more of its kind.
144000	146000	To do so, it needs energy.
146000	151000	And this is where an awareness of the world comes in handy.
151000	161000	The original function of consciousness was probably to direct a mobile self that was short of energy to a fresh supply of food.
162000	167000	On the smaller scales of life, you don't need to be aware to find food.
168000	174000	Trichoplex adherens, one of the simplest of all animals, moves around haphazardly.
174000	179000	It slows down in the presence of food and speeds up in its absence.
179000	186000	This is highly effective and makes the tiny creature spend more time where there is food than where there is not.
187000	196000	But it never moves in a particular direction towards a particular target, and there's no need for it to be conscious of its environment.
196000	205000	The first major step towards consciousness was probably taken when mobile selves started to move themselves directionally.
205000	214000	Moving towards what was good for them, say food, and away from what was less good, say someone else who thought that they were food.
215000	220000	Take Dugicia tigrina, a tiny worm known for its funny face.
220000	224000	Sometimes the worm is hungry, and sometimes not.
224000	231000	This means that when it moves, the worm self is not simply producing an automatic response to an external stimulus,
231000	238000	but that its actions depend upon its inner, physiological state, whether it's hungry or sated.
238000	247000	When it's just eaten, the worm is less energetic, but when starved for a while, it will move itself in the direction of tasty things.
247000	256000	It uses chemoreceptors on its head to smell its environment and guide it in the direction where the scent of food is strongest.
256000	266000	After finding and eating a meal, our worm buddy heads back to a dark, sheltered spot to digest it in safety, until it's hungry again.
266000	273000	But animals that blindly follow their sense of smell don't have a concrete objective in view.
273000	277000	They still lack any sense of where they are heading.
277000	285000	So the next step on the ladder of consciousness is to add some perception at a distance, like vision.
285000	289000	Vision adds context and depth to our world.
289000	294000	With vision comes a sense of the space we and our food exist in.
294000	301000	It adds a whole new dimension to awareness and is a huge step towards more familiar consciousness.
301000	308000	An optical apparatus like an eye enables us to visualize our goal and lock onto it.
308000	315000	But even at this stage, a self is only able to pursue its food as long as it sees it.
315000	320000	So the next logical step needs to happen on the inside.
320000	328000	To visualize food in its absence, for example, a self needs to create some sort of inner representation of the world.
328000	335000	Now an animal can continue looking for food, even when it escapes its sensory range.
335000	344000	Because of this inner representation of what is relevant in the world, it can remain focused on its food and its desire to get it.
344000	349000	Our self now exists in a world it can get familiar with.
349000	352000	The ability to remember things has emerged.
352000	360000	Thanks to memory, animals can be distracted from a pursuit for a few seconds, but quickly continue their path afterwards.
360000	364000	A related phenomenon is called object permanence.
364000	371000	This describes our awareness that things continue to exist even when we can't see them.
371000	377000	This cognitive skill is enjoyed by some mammals and birds, and perhaps other animals too.
378000	387000	Human babies tend to develop this ability around the time they turn eight months, while baby chickens show this ability within a day or two of being born.
387000	394000	The capacity to remember a thing in its absence suggests at least a basic sense of time.
394000	399000	A sense of time is a big step on the ladder of consciousness.
399000	406000	It may also enable a self to look forward from the present moment and anticipate the future.
406000	415000	Adult chickens, for example, are able to resist a meal put in front of them if they expect to receive a bigger meal as a prize for holding back for a while.
415000	427000	This sort of delayed gratification means there is an ability to visualize a reward that only exists in the future, which can be quite a challenge even for adult humans.
427000	431000	Western scrubjays are experts in delayed gratification.
431000	438000	They show an even more elaborate sense of the future when they hide food in a cache to retrieve it at a later date.
438000	444000	The scrubjays will even re-hide their food if they become aware that a potential thief has been watching them.
444000	453000	This means that they know that there are other hungry selves out there who are aware and see the world from their own, different perspective.
453000	458000	Crafty scrubjays can sort of read the mind of their fellow birds.
458000	464000	This ability to mind-read is crucial for complex levels of consciousness.
464000	472000	By putting yourself in the position of others, you can outsmart a rich competitor or empathize with a hungry friend.
472000	478000	Language takes the ability to read minds and represent what is absent to a whole new level.
478000	486000	Words enable us to construct hypotheses about the world, make detailed plans, and to communicate them with others.
486000	497000	Words enable us to think about ourselves and our place in the universe, and even about our own consciousness, which is something we'll be doing more in future videos.
497000	501000	So what is the origin of our consciousness?
501000	507000	It probably began as the directed motion of a hungry self towards a source of food.
507000	513000	With the survival benefits, this gave it over competitors that moved at random or not at all.
513000	518000	It probably all started with the urge for more food.
518000	531000	So even with the sophisticated consciousness that allows us to dream about space, build skyscrapers, or obsess about novels, it's not surprising that we can't stop thinking about where we'll get our next meal.
531000	543000	Collectively, we've put so much thought and ingenuity into getting food that we can now just get our food to come to us with little conscious effort.
