00:00.000 --> 00:04.000
Consciousness is perhaps the biggest riddle in nature.

00:04.000 --> 00:13.000
Stripped to its core meaning, consciousness is what allows us to be aware both of our surroundings and of our own inner state.

00:13.000 --> 00:19.000
But thinking about consciousness has this habit of taking us round in circles.

00:19.000 --> 00:24.000
We all intuitively know what consciousness is, it's this.

00:24.000 --> 00:28.000
It's what you're experiencing here, right now.

00:28.000 --> 00:34.000
But once we try to pinpoint just what exactly it is, it leaves us grasping at thin air.

00:34.000 --> 00:36.000
And not just us.

00:36.000 --> 00:40.000
Philosophers and scientists struggle to define consciousness.

00:40.000 --> 00:47.000
Different schools and ideas compete with one another, but no one has come close to figuring it out.

00:47.000 --> 00:54.000
It's unsettling to realize that we don't understand what makes us aware of ourselves and the world.

00:54.000 --> 01:01.000
In this fuzzy area, consciousness and intelligence are also related, although they are not the same.

01:01.000 --> 01:06.000
We'll talk in greater depth about theories of consciousness and intelligence in other videos.

01:06.000 --> 01:16.000
Like much of what makes us human, our consciousness is likely to have evolved from less complex forms as a product of evolution by natural selection.

01:17.000 --> 01:27.000
It has probably emerged from an immense several hundred million year sequence of countless microsteps that together make up a sort of gradient of consciousness.

01:27.000 --> 01:38.000
What was the first step on this path from the non-conscious to the basic consciousness that ultimately led to the convoluted consciousness we humans enjoy today?

01:47.000 --> 01:57.000
Take a stone. The consensus is that a stone is not conscious, though not everyone agrees even on this.

01:57.000 --> 02:02.000
Some panpsychists claim that a lump of rock may have an inner life.

02:02.000 --> 02:09.000
However, there are no real grounds for any such assumption, since stones never show behavior.

02:09.000 --> 02:13.000
Their inner life can neither be proven nor disproven.

02:14.000 --> 02:17.000
A more common starting point is with living things.

02:17.000 --> 02:24.000
A living thing, or a self, is a part of the universe that sustains itself and makes more of its kind.

02:24.000 --> 02:26.000
To do so, it needs energy.

02:26.000 --> 02:31.000
And this is where an awareness of the world comes in handy.

02:31.000 --> 02:41.000
The original function of consciousness was probably to direct a mobile self that was short of energy to a fresh supply of food.

02:42.000 --> 02:47.000
On the smaller scales of life, you don't need to be aware to find food.

02:48.000 --> 02:54.000
Trichoplex adherens, one of the simplest of all animals, moves around haphazardly.

02:54.000 --> 02:59.000
It slows down in the presence of food and speeds up in its absence.

02:59.000 --> 03:06.000
This is highly effective and makes the tiny creature spend more time where there is food than where there is not.

03:07.000 --> 03:16.000
But it never moves in a particular direction towards a particular target, and there's no need for it to be conscious of its environment.

03:16.000 --> 03:25.000
The first major step towards consciousness was probably taken when mobile selves started to move themselves directionally.

03:25.000 --> 03:34.000
Moving towards what was good for them, say food, and away from what was less good, say someone else who thought that they were food.

03:35.000 --> 03:40.000
Take Dugicia tigrina, a tiny worm known for its funny face.

03:40.000 --> 03:44.000
Sometimes the worm is hungry, and sometimes not.

03:44.000 --> 03:51.000
This means that when it moves, the worm self is not simply producing an automatic response to an external stimulus,

03:51.000 --> 03:58.000
but that its actions depend upon its inner, physiological state, whether it's hungry or sated.

03:58.000 --> 04:07.000
When it's just eaten, the worm is less energetic, but when starved for a while, it will move itself in the direction of tasty things.

04:07.000 --> 04:16.000
It uses chemoreceptors on its head to smell its environment and guide it in the direction where the scent of food is strongest.

04:16.000 --> 04:26.000
After finding and eating a meal, our worm buddy heads back to a dark, sheltered spot to digest it in safety, until it's hungry again.

04:26.000 --> 04:33.000
But animals that blindly follow their sense of smell don't have a concrete objective in view.

04:33.000 --> 04:37.000
They still lack any sense of where they are heading.

04:37.000 --> 04:45.000
So the next step on the ladder of consciousness is to add some perception at a distance, like vision.

04:45.000 --> 04:49.000
Vision adds context and depth to our world.

04:49.000 --> 04:54.000
With vision comes a sense of the space we and our food exist in.

04:54.000 --> 05:01.000
It adds a whole new dimension to awareness and is a huge step towards more familiar consciousness.

05:01.000 --> 05:08.000
An optical apparatus like an eye enables us to visualize our goal and lock onto it.

05:08.000 --> 05:15.000
But even at this stage, a self is only able to pursue its food as long as it sees it.

05:15.000 --> 05:20.000
So the next logical step needs to happen on the inside.

05:20.000 --> 05:28.000
To visualize food in its absence, for example, a self needs to create some sort of inner representation of the world.

05:28.000 --> 05:35.000
Now an animal can continue looking for food, even when it escapes its sensory range.

05:35.000 --> 05:44.000
Because of this inner representation of what is relevant in the world, it can remain focused on its food and its desire to get it.

05:44.000 --> 05:49.000
Our self now exists in a world it can get familiar with.

05:49.000 --> 05:52.000
The ability to remember things has emerged.

05:52.000 --> 06:00.000
Thanks to memory, animals can be distracted from a pursuit for a few seconds, but quickly continue their path afterwards.

06:00.000 --> 06:04.000
A related phenomenon is called object permanence.

06:04.000 --> 06:11.000
This describes our awareness that things continue to exist even when we can't see them.

06:11.000 --> 06:17.000
This cognitive skill is enjoyed by some mammals and birds, and perhaps other animals too.

06:18.000 --> 06:27.000
Human babies tend to develop this ability around the time they turn eight months, while baby chickens show this ability within a day or two of being born.

06:27.000 --> 06:34.000
The capacity to remember a thing in its absence suggests at least a basic sense of time.

06:34.000 --> 06:39.000
A sense of time is a big step on the ladder of consciousness.

06:39.000 --> 06:46.000
It may also enable a self to look forward from the present moment and anticipate the future.

06:46.000 --> 06:55.000
Adult chickens, for example, are able to resist a meal put in front of them if they expect to receive a bigger meal as a prize for holding back for a while.

06:55.000 --> 07:07.000
This sort of delayed gratification means there is an ability to visualize a reward that only exists in the future, which can be quite a challenge even for adult humans.

07:07.000 --> 07:11.000
Western scrubjays are experts in delayed gratification.

07:11.000 --> 07:18.000
They show an even more elaborate sense of the future when they hide food in a cache to retrieve it at a later date.

07:18.000 --> 07:24.000
The scrubjays will even re-hide their food if they become aware that a potential thief has been watching them.

07:24.000 --> 07:33.000
This means that they know that there are other hungry selves out there who are aware and see the world from their own, different perspective.

07:33.000 --> 07:38.000
Crafty scrubjays can sort of read the mind of their fellow birds.

07:38.000 --> 07:44.000
This ability to mind-read is crucial for complex levels of consciousness.

07:44.000 --> 07:52.000
By putting yourself in the position of others, you can outsmart a rich competitor or empathize with a hungry friend.

07:52.000 --> 07:58.000
Language takes the ability to read minds and represent what is absent to a whole new level.

07:58.000 --> 08:06.000
Words enable us to construct hypotheses about the world, make detailed plans, and to communicate them with others.

08:06.000 --> 08:17.000
Words enable us to think about ourselves and our place in the universe, and even about our own consciousness, which is something we'll be doing more in future videos.

08:17.000 --> 08:21.000
So what is the origin of our consciousness?

08:21.000 --> 08:27.000
It probably began as the directed motion of a hungry self towards a source of food.

08:27.000 --> 08:33.000
With the survival benefits, this gave it over competitors that moved at random or not at all.

08:33.000 --> 08:38.000
It probably all started with the urge for more food.

08:38.000 --> 08:51.000
So even with the sophisticated consciousness that allows us to dream about space, build skyscrapers, or obsess about novels, it's not surprising that we can't stop thinking about where we'll get our next meal.

08:51.000 --> 09:03.000
Collectively, we've put so much thought and ingenuity into getting food that we can now just get our food to come to us with little conscious effort.

09:03.000 --> 09:14.000
