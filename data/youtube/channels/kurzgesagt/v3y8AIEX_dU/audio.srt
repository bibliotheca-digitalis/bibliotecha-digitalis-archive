1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
Nothing in the universe is static.

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:08,000
In the Milky Way, billions of stars orbit the galactic center.

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:15,000
Some, like our Sun, are pretty consistent, keeping a distance of around 30,000 light-years from the galactic center,

4
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:19,000
completing an orbit every 230 million years.

5
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:25,000
This dance is not an orderly ballet, more like a skating rink filled with drunk toddlers.

6
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:28,000
This chaos makes the galaxy dangerous.

7
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:34,000
Our solar neighborhood is constantly changing, with stars moving hundreds of kilometers every second.

8
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:40,000
Only the vast distances between objects protect us from the dangers out there.

9
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:43,000
But we might get unlucky in the future.

10
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:47,000
At some point, we can encounter a star going supernova,

11
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:52,000
or a massive object passing by and showering Earth with asteroids.

12
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:59,000
If something like this were to happen, we would likely know thousands, if not millions, of years in advance.

13
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:02,000
But we still couldn't do much about it.

14
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:07,000
Unless we move our whole solar system out of the way.

15
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:20,000
To move the solar system, we need a stellar engine,

16
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:24,000
a megastructure used to steer a star through the galaxy.

17
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:30,000
It's the kind of thing that might be built by an advanced civilization with Dyson Sphere-level technology

18
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:34,000
that's thinking about their future millions of years ahead of time.

19
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:39,000
But how do we possibly move the hundreds of thousands of objects in the solar system?

20
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:42,000
The good news is, we can ignore all of that.

21
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:50,000
We only need to move the sun, all the other stuff is glued to it by gravity, and we'll follow it wherever it decides to go.

22
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:55,000
There are lots of ideas about what a stellar engine might look like and how it would work.

23
00:01:55,000 --> 00:02:01,000
We've picked two grounded in our current understanding of physics that could be built in theory.

24
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:07,000
The simplest kind of stellar engine is the Shkadov thruster, a giant mirror.

25
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:10,000
It works on the same principle as a rocket.

26
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:15,000
Like rocket fuel, the photons released as solar radiation carry momentum.

27
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:17,000
Not a lot, but a bit.

28
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:24,000
For example, if an astronaut turned on a flashlight in space, it would push them backwards very, very slowly.

29
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:31,000
A stellar engine will work a little better than a flashlight because the sun produces a lot of photons.

30
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:38,000
The basic idea of the Shkadov thruster is to reflect up to half of the solar radiation to create thrust

31
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:41,000
and slowly push the sun where we want it to go.

32
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:48,000
In order for the Shkadov thruster to work, it must be kept in the same place, not orbiting the sun.

33
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:55,000
Although the sun's gravity will try to pull it in, it would be supported by radiation pressure, which props the mirror up.

34
00:02:55,000 --> 00:03:03,000
This means the mirror would have to be very light, made of micron-thin reflecting foil from materials like aluminium alloys.

35
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:06,000
The mirror's shape is important too.

36
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:12,000
Enveloping the sun in a giant spherical shell wouldn't work because that would refocus light back to the sun,

37
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:16,000
heating it up and creating all sorts of unpleasant problems.

38
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:24,000
Instead, we use a parabola, which sends most of the photons around the sun and in the same direction, which maximizes thrust.

39
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:29,000
To prevent accidentally burning or freezing Earth with too much or too little sunlight,

40
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:34,000
the only safe place to build a Shkadov thruster is over the sun's poles.

41
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:40,000
This means we can only move the sun vertically in the plane of the solar system and one direction in the Milky Way,

42
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:43,000
which limits our travel options a bit.

43
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:45,000
But that is basically it.

44
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:52,000
For a civilization capable of building a Dyson sphere, this is a relatively simple endeavor.

45
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:56,000
Not complicated, just very hard to build.

46
00:03:56,000 --> 00:04:04,000
At full throttle, the solar system could probably be moved by about 100 light-years over 230 million years.

47
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:10,000
Over a few billion years, it gives us near complete control over the sun's orbit in the galaxy.

48
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:15,000
But in the short term, this might not be fast enough to dodge a deadly supernova.

49
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:18,000
That's why we thought we could do better.

50
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:25,000
So we asked our astrophysicist friend if he could design a faster stellar engine for this video.

51
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:31,000
He did, and wrote a paper about it that's been published in a peer-reviewed journal.

52
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:34,000
You can find it in our sources document.

53
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:39,000
We're going to call our new stellar engine the Kaplan thruster.

54
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:42,000
It works a lot like a traditional rocket.

55
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:45,000
Shoot exhaust one way to push yourself the other.

56
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:53,000
It's a large space station platform powered by a Dyson sphere that gathers matter from the sun to power nuclear fusion.

57
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:59,000
It shoots out a very fast jet of particles at nearly 1% the speed of light out of the solar system.

58
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:03,000
A second jet pushes the sun along like a tugboat.

59
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:08,000
The Kaplan thruster requires a lot of fuel, millions of tons per second.

60
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:18,000
To gather this fuel, our thruster uses very large electromagnetic fields to funnel hydrogen and helium from the solar wind into the engine.

61
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:25,000
The solar wind alone doesn't provide enough fuel though, and that's where the Dyson sphere comes in.

62
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:30,000
Using its power, sunlight can be refocused to the surface of the sun.

63
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:36,000
This heats small regions to extreme temperatures, lifting billions of tons of mass off the sun.

64
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:42,000
This mass can be collected and separated into hydrogen and helium.

65
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:47,000
The helium is burned explosively in thermonuclear fusion reactors.

66
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:56,000
A jet of radioactive oxygen at a temperature of nearly a billion degrees is expelled and becomes our primary source of propulsion from our stellar engine.

67
00:05:56,000 --> 00:06:02,000
To prevent the engine from just crashing into the sun, it needs to balance itself.

68
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:11,000
To do this, we accelerate the collected hydrogen with electromagnetic fields using particle accelerators and shoot a jet back at the sun.

69
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:17,000
This balances the thruster and transfers the thrust of our engine back to the sun.

70
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:25,000
In as little as a million years, this engine can move the sun by 50 light years, more than enough to dodge a supernova.

71
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:33,000
At full throttle, the solar system can be completely redirected in its galactic orbit in 10 million years.

72
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:36,000
But wait, will we use up the sun this way?

73
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:43,000
Fortunately, the sun is so massive that even billions of tons of material will barely scratch the surface.

74
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:55,000
In fact, this megastructure will actually extend our sun's life since lower mass stars burn slower, keeping the solar system inhabitable for many more billions of years.

75
00:06:55,000 --> 00:07:00,000
With a Kaplan thruster, we could turn the entire solar system into our spaceship.

76
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:08,000
For example, by orbiting backwards in the galaxy and colonizing hundreds or thousands of stars as we pass by them.

77
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:14,000
It may even be possible to escape the galaxy entirely and expand beyond the Milky Way.

78
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:22,000
Stellar engines are the kind of machines built by civilizations thinking not in terms of years or decades, but eons.

79
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:36,000
Since we know that our sun will die one day, a stellar engine could allow the far future descendants of humans to travel to other stars without ever having to venture into the terrifying dark abyss of interstellar space.

80
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:44,000
Until we build a stellar engine, we're adrift and subject to the whims of the galactic sea.

81
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:54,000
We may not like where it leads us, maybe our descendants will set sail and become an interstellar species for millions of years to come.

82
00:07:56,000 --> 00:08:03,000
This was our last video for the year 12,019 of the human era, and what a year it was.

83
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:07,000
So much stuff happened everywhere, to so many different people.

84
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:15,000
Calendars and holidays are just imaginary, but they help us to cut our lives into pieces that our brains can handle.

85
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:21,000
We're leaving 12,019 behind with a weird mixture of disillusion and hope.

86
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:24,000
The world is screwed up, but we can fix it.

87
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:29,000
In a few days, this year will be over, and we all get to try again.

88
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:34,000
Thank you for watching our videos, and for sticking around for so many years.

89
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:37,000
See you all in 12,020.
