0	4000	Nothing in the universe is static.
4000	8000	In the Milky Way, billions of stars orbit the galactic center.
8000	15000	Some, like our Sun, are pretty consistent, keeping a distance of around 30,000 light-years from the galactic center,
15000	19000	completing an orbit every 230 million years.
19000	25000	This dance is not an orderly ballet, more like a skating rink filled with drunk toddlers.
25000	28000	This chaos makes the galaxy dangerous.
28000	34000	Our solar neighborhood is constantly changing, with stars moving hundreds of kilometers every second.
34000	40000	Only the vast distances between objects protect us from the dangers out there.
40000	43000	But we might get unlucky in the future.
43000	47000	At some point, we can encounter a star going supernova,
47000	52000	or a massive object passing by and showering Earth with asteroids.
52000	59000	If something like this were to happen, we would likely know thousands, if not millions, of years in advance.
59000	62000	But we still couldn't do much about it.
62000	67000	Unless we move our whole solar system out of the way.
76000	80000	To move the solar system, we need a stellar engine,
80000	84000	a megastructure used to steer a star through the galaxy.
84000	90000	It's the kind of thing that might be built by an advanced civilization with Dyson Sphere-level technology
90000	94000	that's thinking about their future millions of years ahead of time.
94000	99000	But how do we possibly move the hundreds of thousands of objects in the solar system?
99000	102000	The good news is, we can ignore all of that.
102000	110000	We only need to move the sun, all the other stuff is glued to it by gravity, and we'll follow it wherever it decides to go.
110000	115000	There are lots of ideas about what a stellar engine might look like and how it would work.
115000	121000	We've picked two grounded in our current understanding of physics that could be built in theory.
121000	127000	The simplest kind of stellar engine is the Shkadov thruster, a giant mirror.
127000	130000	It works on the same principle as a rocket.
130000	135000	Like rocket fuel, the photons released as solar radiation carry momentum.
135000	137000	Not a lot, but a bit.
137000	144000	For example, if an astronaut turned on a flashlight in space, it would push them backwards very, very slowly.
144000	151000	A stellar engine will work a little better than a flashlight because the sun produces a lot of photons.
151000	158000	The basic idea of the Shkadov thruster is to reflect up to half of the solar radiation to create thrust
158000	161000	and slowly push the sun where we want it to go.
161000	168000	In order for the Shkadov thruster to work, it must be kept in the same place, not orbiting the sun.
168000	175000	Although the sun's gravity will try to pull it in, it would be supported by radiation pressure, which props the mirror up.
175000	183000	This means the mirror would have to be very light, made of micron-thin reflecting foil from materials like aluminium alloys.
183000	186000	The mirror's shape is important too.
186000	192000	Enveloping the sun in a giant spherical shell wouldn't work because that would refocus light back to the sun,
192000	196000	heating it up and creating all sorts of unpleasant problems.
196000	204000	Instead, we use a parabola, which sends most of the photons around the sun and in the same direction, which maximizes thrust.
204000	209000	To prevent accidentally burning or freezing Earth with too much or too little sunlight,
209000	214000	the only safe place to build a Shkadov thruster is over the sun's poles.
214000	220000	This means we can only move the sun vertically in the plane of the solar system and one direction in the Milky Way,
220000	223000	which limits our travel options a bit.
223000	225000	But that is basically it.
225000	232000	For a civilization capable of building a Dyson sphere, this is a relatively simple endeavor.
232000	236000	Not complicated, just very hard to build.
236000	244000	At full throttle, the solar system could probably be moved by about 100 light-years over 230 million years.
244000	250000	Over a few billion years, it gives us near complete control over the sun's orbit in the galaxy.
250000	255000	But in the short term, this might not be fast enough to dodge a deadly supernova.
255000	258000	That's why we thought we could do better.
258000	265000	So we asked our astrophysicist friend if he could design a faster stellar engine for this video.
265000	271000	He did, and wrote a paper about it that's been published in a peer-reviewed journal.
271000	274000	You can find it in our sources document.
274000	279000	We're going to call our new stellar engine the Kaplan thruster.
279000	282000	It works a lot like a traditional rocket.
282000	285000	Shoot exhaust one way to push yourself the other.
285000	293000	It's a large space station platform powered by a Dyson sphere that gathers matter from the sun to power nuclear fusion.
293000	299000	It shoots out a very fast jet of particles at nearly 1% the speed of light out of the solar system.
299000	303000	A second jet pushes the sun along like a tugboat.
303000	308000	The Kaplan thruster requires a lot of fuel, millions of tons per second.
308000	318000	To gather this fuel, our thruster uses very large electromagnetic fields to funnel hydrogen and helium from the solar wind into the engine.
319000	325000	The solar wind alone doesn't provide enough fuel though, and that's where the Dyson sphere comes in.
325000	330000	Using its power, sunlight can be refocused to the surface of the sun.
330000	336000	This heats small regions to extreme temperatures, lifting billions of tons of mass off the sun.
336000	342000	This mass can be collected and separated into hydrogen and helium.
342000	347000	The helium is burned explosively in thermonuclear fusion reactors.
347000	356000	A jet of radioactive oxygen at a temperature of nearly a billion degrees is expelled and becomes our primary source of propulsion from our stellar engine.
356000	362000	To prevent the engine from just crashing into the sun, it needs to balance itself.
362000	371000	To do this, we accelerate the collected hydrogen with electromagnetic fields using particle accelerators and shoot a jet back at the sun.
371000	377000	This balances the thruster and transfers the thrust of our engine back to the sun.
377000	385000	In as little as a million years, this engine can move the sun by 50 light years, more than enough to dodge a supernova.
385000	393000	At full throttle, the solar system can be completely redirected in its galactic orbit in 10 million years.
393000	396000	But wait, will we use up the sun this way?
396000	403000	Fortunately, the sun is so massive that even billions of tons of material will barely scratch the surface.
403000	415000	In fact, this megastructure will actually extend our sun's life since lower mass stars burn slower, keeping the solar system inhabitable for many more billions of years.
415000	420000	With a Kaplan thruster, we could turn the entire solar system into our spaceship.
420000	428000	For example, by orbiting backwards in the galaxy and colonizing hundreds or thousands of stars as we pass by them.
428000	434000	It may even be possible to escape the galaxy entirely and expand beyond the Milky Way.
434000	442000	Stellar engines are the kind of machines built by civilizations thinking not in terms of years or decades, but eons.
443000	456000	Since we know that our sun will die one day, a stellar engine could allow the far future descendants of humans to travel to other stars without ever having to venture into the terrifying dark abyss of interstellar space.
458000	464000	Until we build a stellar engine, we're adrift and subject to the whims of the galactic sea.
464000	474000	We may not like where it leads us, maybe our descendants will set sail and become an interstellar species for millions of years to come.
476000	483000	This was our last video for the year 12,019 of the human era, and what a year it was.
483000	487000	So much stuff happened everywhere, to so many different people.
487000	495000	Calendars and holidays are just imaginary, but they help us to cut our lives into pieces that our brains can handle.
495000	501000	We're leaving 12,019 behind with a weird mixture of disillusion and hope.
501000	504000	The world is screwed up, but we can fix it.
504000	509000	In a few days, this year will be over, and we all get to try again.
509000	514000	Thank you for watching our videos, and for sticking around for so many years.
514000	517000	See you all in 12,020.
