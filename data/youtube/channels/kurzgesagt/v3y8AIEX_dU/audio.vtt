00:00.000 --> 00:04.000
Nothing in the universe is static.

00:04.000 --> 00:08.000
In the Milky Way, billions of stars orbit the galactic center.

00:08.000 --> 00:15.000
Some, like our Sun, are pretty consistent, keeping a distance of around 30,000 light-years from the galactic center,

00:15.000 --> 00:19.000
completing an orbit every 230 million years.

00:19.000 --> 00:25.000
This dance is not an orderly ballet, more like a skating rink filled with drunk toddlers.

00:25.000 --> 00:28.000
This chaos makes the galaxy dangerous.

00:28.000 --> 00:34.000
Our solar neighborhood is constantly changing, with stars moving hundreds of kilometers every second.

00:34.000 --> 00:40.000
Only the vast distances between objects protect us from the dangers out there.

00:40.000 --> 00:43.000
But we might get unlucky in the future.

00:43.000 --> 00:47.000
At some point, we can encounter a star going supernova,

00:47.000 --> 00:52.000
or a massive object passing by and showering Earth with asteroids.

00:52.000 --> 00:59.000
If something like this were to happen, we would likely know thousands, if not millions, of years in advance.

00:59.000 --> 01:02.000
But we still couldn't do much about it.

01:02.000 --> 01:07.000
Unless we move our whole solar system out of the way.

01:16.000 --> 01:20.000
To move the solar system, we need a stellar engine,

01:20.000 --> 01:24.000
a megastructure used to steer a star through the galaxy.

01:24.000 --> 01:30.000
It's the kind of thing that might be built by an advanced civilization with Dyson Sphere-level technology

01:30.000 --> 01:34.000
that's thinking about their future millions of years ahead of time.

01:34.000 --> 01:39.000
But how do we possibly move the hundreds of thousands of objects in the solar system?

01:39.000 --> 01:42.000
The good news is, we can ignore all of that.

01:42.000 --> 01:50.000
We only need to move the sun, all the other stuff is glued to it by gravity, and we'll follow it wherever it decides to go.

01:50.000 --> 01:55.000
There are lots of ideas about what a stellar engine might look like and how it would work.

01:55.000 --> 02:01.000
We've picked two grounded in our current understanding of physics that could be built in theory.

02:01.000 --> 02:07.000
The simplest kind of stellar engine is the Shkadov thruster, a giant mirror.

02:07.000 --> 02:10.000
It works on the same principle as a rocket.

02:10.000 --> 02:15.000
Like rocket fuel, the photons released as solar radiation carry momentum.

02:15.000 --> 02:17.000
Not a lot, but a bit.

02:17.000 --> 02:24.000
For example, if an astronaut turned on a flashlight in space, it would push them backwards very, very slowly.

02:24.000 --> 02:31.000
A stellar engine will work a little better than a flashlight because the sun produces a lot of photons.

02:31.000 --> 02:38.000
The basic idea of the Shkadov thruster is to reflect up to half of the solar radiation to create thrust

02:38.000 --> 02:41.000
and slowly push the sun where we want it to go.

02:41.000 --> 02:48.000
In order for the Shkadov thruster to work, it must be kept in the same place, not orbiting the sun.

02:48.000 --> 02:55.000
Although the sun's gravity will try to pull it in, it would be supported by radiation pressure, which props the mirror up.

02:55.000 --> 03:03.000
This means the mirror would have to be very light, made of micron-thin reflecting foil from materials like aluminium alloys.

03:03.000 --> 03:06.000
The mirror's shape is important too.

03:06.000 --> 03:12.000
Enveloping the sun in a giant spherical shell wouldn't work because that would refocus light back to the sun,

03:12.000 --> 03:16.000
heating it up and creating all sorts of unpleasant problems.

03:16.000 --> 03:24.000
Instead, we use a parabola, which sends most of the photons around the sun and in the same direction, which maximizes thrust.

03:24.000 --> 03:29.000
To prevent accidentally burning or freezing Earth with too much or too little sunlight,

03:29.000 --> 03:34.000
the only safe place to build a Shkadov thruster is over the sun's poles.

03:34.000 --> 03:40.000
This means we can only move the sun vertically in the plane of the solar system and one direction in the Milky Way,

03:40.000 --> 03:43.000
which limits our travel options a bit.

03:43.000 --> 03:45.000
But that is basically it.

03:45.000 --> 03:52.000
For a civilization capable of building a Dyson sphere, this is a relatively simple endeavor.

03:52.000 --> 03:56.000
Not complicated, just very hard to build.

03:56.000 --> 04:04.000
At full throttle, the solar system could probably be moved by about 100 light-years over 230 million years.

04:04.000 --> 04:10.000
Over a few billion years, it gives us near complete control over the sun's orbit in the galaxy.

04:10.000 --> 04:15.000
But in the short term, this might not be fast enough to dodge a deadly supernova.

04:15.000 --> 04:18.000
That's why we thought we could do better.

04:18.000 --> 04:25.000
So we asked our astrophysicist friend if he could design a faster stellar engine for this video.

04:25.000 --> 04:31.000
He did, and wrote a paper about it that's been published in a peer-reviewed journal.

04:31.000 --> 04:34.000
You can find it in our sources document.

04:34.000 --> 04:39.000
We're going to call our new stellar engine the Kaplan thruster.

04:39.000 --> 04:42.000
It works a lot like a traditional rocket.

04:42.000 --> 04:45.000
Shoot exhaust one way to push yourself the other.

04:45.000 --> 04:53.000
It's a large space station platform powered by a Dyson sphere that gathers matter from the sun to power nuclear fusion.

04:53.000 --> 04:59.000
It shoots out a very fast jet of particles at nearly 1% the speed of light out of the solar system.

04:59.000 --> 05:03.000
A second jet pushes the sun along like a tugboat.

05:03.000 --> 05:08.000
The Kaplan thruster requires a lot of fuel, millions of tons per second.

05:08.000 --> 05:18.000
To gather this fuel, our thruster uses very large electromagnetic fields to funnel hydrogen and helium from the solar wind into the engine.

05:19.000 --> 05:25.000
The solar wind alone doesn't provide enough fuel though, and that's where the Dyson sphere comes in.

05:25.000 --> 05:30.000
Using its power, sunlight can be refocused to the surface of the sun.

05:30.000 --> 05:36.000
This heats small regions to extreme temperatures, lifting billions of tons of mass off the sun.

05:36.000 --> 05:42.000
This mass can be collected and separated into hydrogen and helium.

05:42.000 --> 05:47.000
The helium is burned explosively in thermonuclear fusion reactors.

05:47.000 --> 05:56.000
A jet of radioactive oxygen at a temperature of nearly a billion degrees is expelled and becomes our primary source of propulsion from our stellar engine.

05:56.000 --> 06:02.000
To prevent the engine from just crashing into the sun, it needs to balance itself.

06:02.000 --> 06:11.000
To do this, we accelerate the collected hydrogen with electromagnetic fields using particle accelerators and shoot a jet back at the sun.

06:11.000 --> 06:17.000
This balances the thruster and transfers the thrust of our engine back to the sun.

06:17.000 --> 06:25.000
In as little as a million years, this engine can move the sun by 50 light years, more than enough to dodge a supernova.

06:25.000 --> 06:33.000
At full throttle, the solar system can be completely redirected in its galactic orbit in 10 million years.

06:33.000 --> 06:36.000
But wait, will we use up the sun this way?

06:36.000 --> 06:43.000
Fortunately, the sun is so massive that even billions of tons of material will barely scratch the surface.

06:43.000 --> 06:55.000
In fact, this megastructure will actually extend our sun's life since lower mass stars burn slower, keeping the solar system inhabitable for many more billions of years.

06:55.000 --> 07:00.000
With a Kaplan thruster, we could turn the entire solar system into our spaceship.

07:00.000 --> 07:08.000
For example, by orbiting backwards in the galaxy and colonizing hundreds or thousands of stars as we pass by them.

07:08.000 --> 07:14.000
It may even be possible to escape the galaxy entirely and expand beyond the Milky Way.

07:14.000 --> 07:22.000
Stellar engines are the kind of machines built by civilizations thinking not in terms of years or decades, but eons.

07:23.000 --> 07:36.000
Since we know that our sun will die one day, a stellar engine could allow the far future descendants of humans to travel to other stars without ever having to venture into the terrifying dark abyss of interstellar space.

07:38.000 --> 07:44.000
Until we build a stellar engine, we're adrift and subject to the whims of the galactic sea.

07:44.000 --> 07:54.000
We may not like where it leads us, maybe our descendants will set sail and become an interstellar species for millions of years to come.

07:56.000 --> 08:03.000
This was our last video for the year 12,019 of the human era, and what a year it was.

08:03.000 --> 08:07.000
So much stuff happened everywhere, to so many different people.

08:07.000 --> 08:15.000
Calendars and holidays are just imaginary, but they help us to cut our lives into pieces that our brains can handle.

08:15.000 --> 08:21.000
We're leaving 12,019 behind with a weird mixture of disillusion and hope.

08:21.000 --> 08:24.000
The world is screwed up, but we can fix it.

08:24.000 --> 08:29.000
In a few days, this year will be over, and we all get to try again.

08:29.000 --> 08:34.000
Thank you for watching our videos, and for sticking around for so many years.

08:34.000 --> 08:37.000
See you all in 12,020.
