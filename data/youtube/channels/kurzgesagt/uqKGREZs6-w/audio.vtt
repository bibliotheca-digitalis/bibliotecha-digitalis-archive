00:00.000 --> 00:08.000
From hostile deserts to lonely islands and the highest mountains, wherever there is space to expand into, humans do so.

00:08.000 --> 00:13.000
So, it's hardly surprising that we're already making preparations to set foot on Mars,

00:13.000 --> 00:22.000
and to create the first permanent colony outside of Earth, maybe even terraform another planet and turn it into a second blue home.

00:22.000 --> 00:28.000
But wait! Before we can get to the nice future stuff, we first have to complete the second phase of colonization,

00:28.000 --> 00:33.000
creating a semi-permanent outpost to prepare the ground for a larger human presence.

00:33.000 --> 00:36.000
But doing so will be gruesome.

00:46.000 --> 00:51.000
Even for an expansionist species like us, Mars is extreme.

00:51.000 --> 01:00.000
At first glance, Mars seems familiar. Polar ice caps, large valleys, liquid water under its surface, and a day barely longer than Earth's.

01:00.000 --> 01:03.000
The ideal place for us to go.

01:03.000 --> 01:11.000
Unfortunately, Mars is actually a cold, radioactive desert where the ground is poisonous and breathing is impossible.

01:11.000 --> 01:16.000
Mars is awful. You almost certainly don't want to go there.

01:16.000 --> 01:25.000
The pioneers doing the hard work on Mars will have an intensely stressful life, filled with incredibly challenging problems never encountered before.

01:25.000 --> 01:31.000
But there are plenty of people willing to do that work, and we have the technology to enable them to do it.

01:31.000 --> 01:39.000
For this video, we will assume there have been prior missions to Mars to scout out a good place for an outpost, store resources and equipment,

01:39.000 --> 01:43.000
and that there's already a moon base that serves as a hub for Mars missions.

01:43.000 --> 01:49.000
The first major challenge for our outpost is the fact that Mars is very energy poor.

01:49.000 --> 01:55.000
Because of its distance from the sun, solar power is only 40% as effective as on Earth.

01:55.000 --> 02:01.000
But even this weakened sunlight is often obscured for days by enormous dust storms.

02:01.000 --> 02:04.000
Solar power alone will probably not be enough.

02:04.000 --> 02:14.000
Alternatives such as wind power and geothermal energy are also unfeasible, as there's hardly any atmosphere and Mars's interior is much too cold.

02:14.000 --> 02:18.000
Initially, nuclear technology might be the only option.

02:18.000 --> 02:25.000
Since Mars doesn't have easily accessible radioactive elements, the nuclear fuel needs to come from Earth along with the reactor.

02:25.000 --> 02:30.000
If we do set it up, it could power our small outpost for the first few years.

02:30.000 --> 02:35.000
Unfortunately, all that energy won't be very useful if we can't breathe.

02:35.000 --> 02:40.000
Mars's atmosphere is only 1% as dense as Earth's and mostly made up of CO2.

02:40.000 --> 02:49.000
So our habitats need to be pressurized and filled with an artificial atmosphere made of nitrogen and oxygen, which comes with more problems.

02:49.000 --> 02:59.000
Corners and flat walls are weak points, so the habitats will have rounded and smooth shapes to handle the stress of great pressure differences between the interior and exterior.

02:59.000 --> 03:04.000
The airlocks need to be very airtight and work perfectly every time.

03:04.000 --> 03:11.000
Without an extensive magnetosphere or a dense atmosphere, half of all radiation coming from space reaches the ground.

03:11.000 --> 03:17.000
A person on the surface would be subjected to 50 times the radiation that they would be on Earth.

03:17.000 --> 03:25.000
Three years on the surface of Mars exceeds the radiation dose limits imposed on NASA astronauts for their entire career.

03:25.000 --> 03:28.000
This increases cancer risks significantly.

03:28.000 --> 03:36.000
To prevent that, we could shield our habitats with a thick layer of frozen CO2 that can be harvested directly from the atmosphere.

03:36.000 --> 03:41.000
Covering the dry ice with a meter of dirt would further increase the level of protection.

03:41.000 --> 03:44.000
Sadly, this means almost no windows.

03:44.000 --> 03:48.000
From the inside, most living spaces will be windowless tunnels.

03:48.000 --> 03:51.000
From the outside, they'll look like burial mounds.

03:51.000 --> 03:58.000
All of this would still not hold back all the radiation, but reduce it just enough to be survivable for long periods of time.

03:58.000 --> 04:02.000
It won't, however, protect anyone who ventures outside.

04:02.000 --> 04:08.000
So, remote-controlled robots will be used for routine work on the surface while our crew stays inside.

04:08.000 --> 04:13.000
Staying inside is a good idea for another reason, Mars dust.

04:13.000 --> 04:19.000
It's much finer than dust on Earth, so it could find its way into the gears or electronics of our machines.

04:19.000 --> 04:25.000
Because it's also very dry, it's electrostatically charged, sticking to everything, like spacesuits.

04:25.000 --> 04:31.000
It would be impossible to avoid carrying lots of Mars dust into our habitat and into the lungs of our crew.

04:31.000 --> 04:37.000
To make this even worse, Mars's soil is filled with very toxic perchlorate salts.

04:37.000 --> 04:39.000
Constant exposure could be deadly.

04:39.000 --> 04:42.000
This problem can still be overcome, though.

04:42.000 --> 04:48.000
Spacesuits, for example, could be made in a way that they never truly enter the base but stay attached to the outside of the habitats.

04:49.000 --> 04:50.000
Okay, great.

04:50.000 --> 04:58.000
Now we've safely isolated humans in terms of energy and air and protected them from cancer, we just need to feed them.

04:58.000 --> 05:04.000
Water is easy to come by if a settlement is positioned near the Martian poles with their thick layers of ice.

05:04.000 --> 05:07.000
Growing food is a different kind of challenge, though.

05:07.000 --> 05:14.000
Mars's soils are alkaline and lack the vital nitrogen compounds that plants need to grow.

05:14.000 --> 05:20.000
Before we can grow anything, we will have to decontaminate the soil, which is difficult and expensive.

05:20.000 --> 05:24.000
Then the soil can be fertilized using recycled biological waste.

05:24.000 --> 05:28.000
All of this will take a lot of time and is very energy intensive.

05:28.000 --> 05:37.000
So we might use aquaponics to raise fish and plants together, making the astronaut's diets more varied and tasty at the same time.

05:37.000 --> 05:42.000
This will be an important psychological boost for our overworked crew.

05:42.000 --> 05:45.000
All of these things don't solve one fundamental problem, though.

05:45.000 --> 05:54.000
Mars has only 38% of Earth's surface gravity, which could cause muscle wasting, bone loss, and cardiovascular problems.

05:54.000 --> 06:05.000
While this might be solved in the future by setting up rotating living spaces, for now our crew has to live with low gravity and exercise a lot to slow the degradation down.

06:05.000 --> 06:13.000
The crews will probably have to rotate every few years, after being stuck indoors in tight spaces without windows with the same people,

06:13.000 --> 06:20.000
performing the same routines day in, day out with little contact from the outside world and a lot to worry about.

06:20.000 --> 06:31.000
Like Antarctic scientists or submarine staff, they will undergo intense psychological screening to make sure they are mentally resilient enough to handle this lifestyle for several years.

06:31.000 --> 06:40.000
Establishing the first real infrastructure on Mars will be extremely taxing work that only a group of very determined and competent people can do.

06:40.000 --> 06:43.000
Luckily, we have enough of these on Earth.

06:43.000 --> 06:49.000
And there you have it, a small Mars base that will survive for at least a few decades,

06:49.000 --> 06:55.000
as long as it's getting a constant supply of resources, parts, nuclear fuel, and crews from Earth.

06:56.000 --> 07:05.000
Unfortunately, Mars and Earth are separated by millions of kilometers and orbital periods that leave only a narrow travel window every two years.

07:05.000 --> 07:11.000
If there's an emergency in the colony, Earth wouldn't be able to help until the next travel window opens.

07:11.000 --> 07:15.000
Helpers may arrive on a planet filled with corpses.

07:15.000 --> 07:19.000
Settling Mars will be the toughest challenge we have ever faced.

07:19.000 --> 07:23.000
It will be gruesome work to establish the infrastructure we need.

07:23.000 --> 07:26.000
But we're stubborn, and we like extreme challenges.

07:26.000 --> 07:30.000
If we push through phase two of colonization, anything is possible.

07:30.000 --> 07:40.000
Cities illuminating the dark Martian night, a hub for travel between the planets, industries setting foot in orbit, terraforming, a true multi-planetary future.

07:40.000 --> 07:44.000
Going to Mars is hard, but worth it.

07:44.000 --> 07:54.000
And if we're lucky, we might be around long enough to see it happening and cheer on the people who take on these challenges for the benefit of us all.

07:56.000 --> 08:02.000
Figuring out complex stuff is one of the best feelings ever, especially if you don't have to do it all by yourself.
