0	8000	From hostile deserts to lonely islands and the highest mountains, wherever there is space to expand into, humans do so.
8000	13000	So, it's hardly surprising that we're already making preparations to set foot on Mars,
13000	22000	and to create the first permanent colony outside of Earth, maybe even terraform another planet and turn it into a second blue home.
22000	28000	But wait! Before we can get to the nice future stuff, we first have to complete the second phase of colonization,
28000	33000	creating a semi-permanent outpost to prepare the ground for a larger human presence.
33000	36000	But doing so will be gruesome.
46000	51000	Even for an expansionist species like us, Mars is extreme.
51000	60000	At first glance, Mars seems familiar. Polar ice caps, large valleys, liquid water under its surface, and a day barely longer than Earth's.
60000	63000	The ideal place for us to go.
63000	71000	Unfortunately, Mars is actually a cold, radioactive desert where the ground is poisonous and breathing is impossible.
71000	76000	Mars is awful. You almost certainly don't want to go there.
76000	85000	The pioneers doing the hard work on Mars will have an intensely stressful life, filled with incredibly challenging problems never encountered before.
85000	91000	But there are plenty of people willing to do that work, and we have the technology to enable them to do it.
91000	99000	For this video, we will assume there have been prior missions to Mars to scout out a good place for an outpost, store resources and equipment,
99000	103000	and that there's already a moon base that serves as a hub for Mars missions.
103000	109000	The first major challenge for our outpost is the fact that Mars is very energy poor.
109000	115000	Because of its distance from the sun, solar power is only 40% as effective as on Earth.
115000	121000	But even this weakened sunlight is often obscured for days by enormous dust storms.
121000	124000	Solar power alone will probably not be enough.
124000	134000	Alternatives such as wind power and geothermal energy are also unfeasible, as there's hardly any atmosphere and Mars's interior is much too cold.
134000	138000	Initially, nuclear technology might be the only option.
138000	145000	Since Mars doesn't have easily accessible radioactive elements, the nuclear fuel needs to come from Earth along with the reactor.
145000	150000	If we do set it up, it could power our small outpost for the first few years.
150000	155000	Unfortunately, all that energy won't be very useful if we can't breathe.
155000	160000	Mars's atmosphere is only 1% as dense as Earth's and mostly made up of CO2.
160000	169000	So our habitats need to be pressurized and filled with an artificial atmosphere made of nitrogen and oxygen, which comes with more problems.
169000	179000	Corners and flat walls are weak points, so the habitats will have rounded and smooth shapes to handle the stress of great pressure differences between the interior and exterior.
179000	184000	The airlocks need to be very airtight and work perfectly every time.
184000	191000	Without an extensive magnetosphere or a dense atmosphere, half of all radiation coming from space reaches the ground.
191000	197000	A person on the surface would be subjected to 50 times the radiation that they would be on Earth.
197000	205000	Three years on the surface of Mars exceeds the radiation dose limits imposed on NASA astronauts for their entire career.
205000	208000	This increases cancer risks significantly.
208000	216000	To prevent that, we could shield our habitats with a thick layer of frozen CO2 that can be harvested directly from the atmosphere.
216000	221000	Covering the dry ice with a meter of dirt would further increase the level of protection.
221000	224000	Sadly, this means almost no windows.
224000	228000	From the inside, most living spaces will be windowless tunnels.
228000	231000	From the outside, they'll look like burial mounds.
231000	238000	All of this would still not hold back all the radiation, but reduce it just enough to be survivable for long periods of time.
238000	242000	It won't, however, protect anyone who ventures outside.
242000	248000	So, remote-controlled robots will be used for routine work on the surface while our crew stays inside.
248000	253000	Staying inside is a good idea for another reason, Mars dust.
253000	259000	It's much finer than dust on Earth, so it could find its way into the gears or electronics of our machines.
259000	265000	Because it's also very dry, it's electrostatically charged, sticking to everything, like spacesuits.
265000	271000	It would be impossible to avoid carrying lots of Mars dust into our habitat and into the lungs of our crew.
271000	277000	To make this even worse, Mars's soil is filled with very toxic perchlorate salts.
277000	279000	Constant exposure could be deadly.
279000	282000	This problem can still be overcome, though.
282000	288000	Spacesuits, for example, could be made in a way that they never truly enter the base but stay attached to the outside of the habitats.
289000	290000	Okay, great.
290000	298000	Now we've safely isolated humans in terms of energy and air and protected them from cancer, we just need to feed them.
298000	304000	Water is easy to come by if a settlement is positioned near the Martian poles with their thick layers of ice.
304000	307000	Growing food is a different kind of challenge, though.
307000	314000	Mars's soils are alkaline and lack the vital nitrogen compounds that plants need to grow.
314000	320000	Before we can grow anything, we will have to decontaminate the soil, which is difficult and expensive.
320000	324000	Then the soil can be fertilized using recycled biological waste.
324000	328000	All of this will take a lot of time and is very energy intensive.
328000	337000	So we might use aquaponics to raise fish and plants together, making the astronaut's diets more varied and tasty at the same time.
337000	342000	This will be an important psychological boost for our overworked crew.
342000	345000	All of these things don't solve one fundamental problem, though.
345000	354000	Mars has only 38% of Earth's surface gravity, which could cause muscle wasting, bone loss, and cardiovascular problems.
354000	365000	While this might be solved in the future by setting up rotating living spaces, for now our crew has to live with low gravity and exercise a lot to slow the degradation down.
365000	373000	The crews will probably have to rotate every few years, after being stuck indoors in tight spaces without windows with the same people,
373000	380000	performing the same routines day in, day out with little contact from the outside world and a lot to worry about.
380000	391000	Like Antarctic scientists or submarine staff, they will undergo intense psychological screening to make sure they are mentally resilient enough to handle this lifestyle for several years.
391000	400000	Establishing the first real infrastructure on Mars will be extremely taxing work that only a group of very determined and competent people can do.
400000	403000	Luckily, we have enough of these on Earth.
403000	409000	And there you have it, a small Mars base that will survive for at least a few decades,
409000	415000	as long as it's getting a constant supply of resources, parts, nuclear fuel, and crews from Earth.
416000	425000	Unfortunately, Mars and Earth are separated by millions of kilometers and orbital periods that leave only a narrow travel window every two years.
425000	431000	If there's an emergency in the colony, Earth wouldn't be able to help until the next travel window opens.
431000	435000	Helpers may arrive on a planet filled with corpses.
435000	439000	Settling Mars will be the toughest challenge we have ever faced.
439000	443000	It will be gruesome work to establish the infrastructure we need.
443000	446000	But we're stubborn, and we like extreme challenges.
446000	450000	If we push through phase two of colonization, anything is possible.
450000	460000	Cities illuminating the dark Martian night, a hub for travel between the planets, industries setting foot in orbit, terraforming, a true multi-planetary future.
460000	464000	Going to Mars is hard, but worth it.
464000	474000	And if we're lucky, we might be around long enough to see it happening and cheer on the people who take on these challenges for the benefit of us all.
476000	482000	Figuring out complex stuff is one of the best feelings ever, especially if you don't have to do it all by yourself.
