0	7000	Terrorism is very scary, especially when it happens close to home, and not in some faraway place.
7000	14000	Nobody likes to be afraid, and we were eager to make the fear go away, so we demanded more security.
14000	19000	In the last decade, it's become increasingly normal for civil liberties to be eroded,
19000	25000	and for government agencies to spy on citizens, to collect and store their personal information.
26000	31000	Regardless of whether you're a fan of right- or left-wing policies, this affects every one of us.
31000	35000	So, we have to take a look at the data, and ask ourselves honestly,
35000	38000	has all of this actually made us safer?
48000	54000	In the aftermath of 9-11, the US government concluded that the law had not kept pace with technology.
54000	60000	It created the terrorist surveillance program, initially to intercept communications linked to Al-Qaeda.
60000	66000	Officials were confident that if the program had been in place before 9-11, the hijackers could have been stopped.
66000	71000	But soon, the new powers were also used to prove guilt by association.
71000	76000	The FBI used immigration records to identify Arab and Muslim foreign nationals in the US.
76000	80000	On this basis, 80,000 individuals were required to register,
80000	86000	another 8,000 were called in for FBI interviews, and more than 5,000 locked up in preventive detention.
86000	93000	Not one terrorist was found in what's been called the most aggressive national campaign of ethnic profiling since World War II.
93000	99000	How commonplace it's since become for government agencies to collect and store the personal data of citizens
99000	103000	was made plain by the leak of the Snowden documents in 2013.
103000	108000	They showed how the NSA can demand information about users from firms like Microsoft or Google,
108000	114000	in addition to their daily collection of data from civilian internet traffic such as email content and contact lists.
114000	121000	So instead of focusing on criminals, governments are increasingly turning their attention to everyone.
121000	128000	But if you're looking for a needle in a haystack, adding more hay to the stack isn't going to make it any easier to find the needle.
128000	134000	On the contrary, every recent success announced by the NSA has come from classic target surveillance.
134000	139000	Despite high hopes, the NSA surveillance program has not stopped any major terror attack.
139000	144000	For instance, one of the Boston Marathon bombers was already a target of the FBI.
144000	152000	So what we need is not even more random data, but better ways to understand and use the information we have.
152000	156000	Spy agencies are also pushing to cripple encryption.
156000	163000	In early 2016, the FBI asked Apple to produce a backdoor program to disable the encryption of a terrorist's iPhone.
163000	170000	Apple publicly declined, not only because this tool could be used to permanently weaken the privacy of law-abiding citizens worldwide,
170000	176000	but fearing to open the floodgates for governments requesting access to a technology used by billions of people,
176000	180000	a fear shared by security experts and cryptographers.
180000	185000	A few weeks later, the FBI revealed that they had hacked the phone themselves,
185000	188000	basically admitting that they lied to the public about the need for a backdoor,
188000	193000	which questions how trustworthy spy agencies are in the debate about privacy and security,
193000	199000	especially considering that the NSA, for example, already has the capability to turn on your iPhone microphone
199000	203000	or activate your laptop camera without you noticing.
203000	209000	Concerns about this are often met with the argument, if you have nothing to hide, you have nothing to fear.
209000	212000	But this reasoning only creates a climate of oppression.
212000	217000	Wanting to keep certain parts of your life private doesn't mean you're doing anything wrong.
217000	220000	Right now, we live in a democracy.
220000	226000	But imagine the damage the wrong person could do with all our data and such easy access to our devices.
226000	233000	Anti-terrorism laws allow the authorities to investigate and punish non-terrorism related crimes more aggressively.
233000	237000	If you give law enforcement powerful tools, they will use them.
237000	240000	That's why democratic oversight is so important.
240000	245000	Even if those tools and laws aren't used against you today, they might be tomorrow.
245000	252000	For example, following the November 2015 Paris attacks, France expanded its already extensive anti-terrorism laws
252000	258000	by giving law enforcement greater powers to conduct house raids and place people under house arrest.
258000	265000	Within weeks, evidence emerged that these powers were being used for unintended purposes such as quashing climate change protests.
265000	272000	The governments of Spain, Hungary and Poland have introduced more restrictive laws on the freedom of assembly and speech.
272000	277000	Freedom of expression in the press in Turkey has been seriously undermined in the last few years,
277000	281000	with people sentenced to prison for criticizing the government.
281000	284000	None of this is effectively helping us fight terrorism.
284000	288000	The motivation behind this might be good, even noble,
288000	293000	but if we let our elected governments limit our personal freedom, the terrorists are winning.
293000	299000	What's worse, if we're not careful, we might slowly move towards a surveillance state.
300000	302000	The data is pretty clear.
302000	307000	The erosion of rights along with mass surveillance hasn't led to significant successes so far,
307000	310000	but it has changed the nature of our society.
310000	316000	Terrorism is a complicated problem without simple solutions.
316000	321000	No security apparatus can prevent a few guys from building a bomb in their basement.
321000	324000	We should keep the principle of proportionality in mind.
324000	330000	Creating master keys to enter millions of phones is not the same as searching a single house.
330000	336000	In most countries, the law already permits a wide range of actions, including targeted surveillance.
336000	341000	To take full advantage of this existing potential, we need better international cooperation
341000	344000	and more effective security and foreign policies,
344000	350000	better application of our present laws instead of new and stricter ones that undermine our freedom.
350000	359000	Let us not, out of fear, destroy what we are most proud of, democracy and our fundamental rights and liberties.
