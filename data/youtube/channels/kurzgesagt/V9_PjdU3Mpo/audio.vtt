00:00.000 --> 00:07.000
Terrorism is very scary, especially when it happens close to home, and not in some faraway place.

00:07.000 --> 00:14.000
Nobody likes to be afraid, and we were eager to make the fear go away, so we demanded more security.

00:14.000 --> 00:19.000
In the last decade, it's become increasingly normal for civil liberties to be eroded,

00:19.000 --> 00:25.000
and for government agencies to spy on citizens, to collect and store their personal information.

00:26.000 --> 00:31.000
Regardless of whether you're a fan of right- or left-wing policies, this affects every one of us.

00:31.000 --> 00:35.000
So, we have to take a look at the data, and ask ourselves honestly,

00:35.000 --> 00:38.000
has all of this actually made us safer?

00:48.000 --> 00:54.000
In the aftermath of 9-11, the US government concluded that the law had not kept pace with technology.

00:54.000 --> 01:00.000
It created the terrorist surveillance program, initially to intercept communications linked to Al-Qaeda.

01:00.000 --> 01:06.000
Officials were confident that if the program had been in place before 9-11, the hijackers could have been stopped.

01:06.000 --> 01:11.000
But soon, the new powers were also used to prove guilt by association.

01:11.000 --> 01:16.000
The FBI used immigration records to identify Arab and Muslim foreign nationals in the US.

01:16.000 --> 01:20.000
On this basis, 80,000 individuals were required to register,

01:20.000 --> 01:26.000
another 8,000 were called in for FBI interviews, and more than 5,000 locked up in preventive detention.

01:26.000 --> 01:33.000
Not one terrorist was found in what's been called the most aggressive national campaign of ethnic profiling since World War II.

01:33.000 --> 01:39.000
How commonplace it's since become for government agencies to collect and store the personal data of citizens

01:39.000 --> 01:43.000
was made plain by the leak of the Snowden documents in 2013.

01:43.000 --> 01:48.000
They showed how the NSA can demand information about users from firms like Microsoft or Google,

01:48.000 --> 01:54.000
in addition to their daily collection of data from civilian internet traffic such as email content and contact lists.

01:54.000 --> 02:01.000
So instead of focusing on criminals, governments are increasingly turning their attention to everyone.

02:01.000 --> 02:08.000
But if you're looking for a needle in a haystack, adding more hay to the stack isn't going to make it any easier to find the needle.

02:08.000 --> 02:14.000
On the contrary, every recent success announced by the NSA has come from classic target surveillance.

02:14.000 --> 02:19.000
Despite high hopes, the NSA surveillance program has not stopped any major terror attack.

02:19.000 --> 02:24.000
For instance, one of the Boston Marathon bombers was already a target of the FBI.

02:24.000 --> 02:32.000
So what we need is not even more random data, but better ways to understand and use the information we have.

02:32.000 --> 02:36.000
Spy agencies are also pushing to cripple encryption.

02:36.000 --> 02:43.000
In early 2016, the FBI asked Apple to produce a backdoor program to disable the encryption of a terrorist's iPhone.

02:43.000 --> 02:50.000
Apple publicly declined, not only because this tool could be used to permanently weaken the privacy of law-abiding citizens worldwide,

02:50.000 --> 02:56.000
but fearing to open the floodgates for governments requesting access to a technology used by billions of people,

02:56.000 --> 03:00.000
a fear shared by security experts and cryptographers.

03:00.000 --> 03:05.000
A few weeks later, the FBI revealed that they had hacked the phone themselves,

03:05.000 --> 03:08.000
basically admitting that they lied to the public about the need for a backdoor,

03:08.000 --> 03:13.000
which questions how trustworthy spy agencies are in the debate about privacy and security,

03:13.000 --> 03:19.000
especially considering that the NSA, for example, already has the capability to turn on your iPhone microphone

03:19.000 --> 03:23.000
or activate your laptop camera without you noticing.

03:23.000 --> 03:29.000
Concerns about this are often met with the argument, if you have nothing to hide, you have nothing to fear.

03:29.000 --> 03:32.000
But this reasoning only creates a climate of oppression.

03:32.000 --> 03:37.000
Wanting to keep certain parts of your life private doesn't mean you're doing anything wrong.

03:37.000 --> 03:40.000
Right now, we live in a democracy.

03:40.000 --> 03:46.000
But imagine the damage the wrong person could do with all our data and such easy access to our devices.

03:46.000 --> 03:53.000
Anti-terrorism laws allow the authorities to investigate and punish non-terrorism related crimes more aggressively.

03:53.000 --> 03:57.000
If you give law enforcement powerful tools, they will use them.

03:57.000 --> 04:00.000
That's why democratic oversight is so important.

04:00.000 --> 04:05.000
Even if those tools and laws aren't used against you today, they might be tomorrow.

04:05.000 --> 04:12.000
For example, following the November 2015 Paris attacks, France expanded its already extensive anti-terrorism laws

04:12.000 --> 04:18.000
by giving law enforcement greater powers to conduct house raids and place people under house arrest.

04:18.000 --> 04:25.000
Within weeks, evidence emerged that these powers were being used for unintended purposes such as quashing climate change protests.

04:25.000 --> 04:32.000
The governments of Spain, Hungary and Poland have introduced more restrictive laws on the freedom of assembly and speech.

04:32.000 --> 04:37.000
Freedom of expression in the press in Turkey has been seriously undermined in the last few years,

04:37.000 --> 04:41.000
with people sentenced to prison for criticizing the government.

04:41.000 --> 04:44.000
None of this is effectively helping us fight terrorism.

04:44.000 --> 04:48.000
The motivation behind this might be good, even noble,

04:48.000 --> 04:53.000
but if we let our elected governments limit our personal freedom, the terrorists are winning.

04:53.000 --> 04:59.000
What's worse, if we're not careful, we might slowly move towards a surveillance state.

05:00.000 --> 05:02.000
The data is pretty clear.

05:02.000 --> 05:07.000
The erosion of rights along with mass surveillance hasn't led to significant successes so far,

05:07.000 --> 05:10.000
but it has changed the nature of our society.

05:10.000 --> 05:16.000
Terrorism is a complicated problem without simple solutions.

05:16.000 --> 05:21.000
No security apparatus can prevent a few guys from building a bomb in their basement.

05:21.000 --> 05:24.000
We should keep the principle of proportionality in mind.

05:24.000 --> 05:30.000
Creating master keys to enter millions of phones is not the same as searching a single house.

05:30.000 --> 05:36.000
In most countries, the law already permits a wide range of actions, including targeted surveillance.

05:36.000 --> 05:41.000
To take full advantage of this existing potential, we need better international cooperation

05:41.000 --> 05:44.000
and more effective security and foreign policies,

05:44.000 --> 05:50.000
better application of our present laws instead of new and stricter ones that undermine our freedom.

05:50.000 --> 05:59.000
Let us not, out of fear, destroy what we are most proud of, democracy and our fundamental rights and liberties.
