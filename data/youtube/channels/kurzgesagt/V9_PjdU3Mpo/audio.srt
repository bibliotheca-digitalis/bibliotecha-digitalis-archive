1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,000
Terrorism is very scary, especially when it happens close to home, and not in some faraway place.

2
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:14,000
Nobody likes to be afraid, and we were eager to make the fear go away, so we demanded more security.

3
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:19,000
In the last decade, it's become increasingly normal for civil liberties to be eroded,

4
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:25,000
and for government agencies to spy on citizens, to collect and store their personal information.

5
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:31,000
Regardless of whether you're a fan of right- or left-wing policies, this affects every one of us.

6
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:35,000
So, we have to take a look at the data, and ask ourselves honestly,

7
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:38,000
has all of this actually made us safer?

8
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:54,000
In the aftermath of 9-11, the US government concluded that the law had not kept pace with technology.

9
00:00:54,000 --> 00:01:00,000
It created the terrorist surveillance program, initially to intercept communications linked to Al-Qaeda.

10
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:06,000
Officials were confident that if the program had been in place before 9-11, the hijackers could have been stopped.

11
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:11,000
But soon, the new powers were also used to prove guilt by association.

12
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:16,000
The FBI used immigration records to identify Arab and Muslim foreign nationals in the US.

13
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:20,000
On this basis, 80,000 individuals were required to register,

14
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:26,000
another 8,000 were called in for FBI interviews, and more than 5,000 locked up in preventive detention.

15
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:33,000
Not one terrorist was found in what's been called the most aggressive national campaign of ethnic profiling since World War II.

16
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:39,000
How commonplace it's since become for government agencies to collect and store the personal data of citizens

17
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:43,000
was made plain by the leak of the Snowden documents in 2013.

18
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:48,000
They showed how the NSA can demand information about users from firms like Microsoft or Google,

19
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:54,000
in addition to their daily collection of data from civilian internet traffic such as email content and contact lists.

20
00:01:54,000 --> 00:02:01,000
So instead of focusing on criminals, governments are increasingly turning their attention to everyone.

21
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:08,000
But if you're looking for a needle in a haystack, adding more hay to the stack isn't going to make it any easier to find the needle.

22
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:14,000
On the contrary, every recent success announced by the NSA has come from classic target surveillance.

23
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:19,000
Despite high hopes, the NSA surveillance program has not stopped any major terror attack.

24
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:24,000
For instance, one of the Boston Marathon bombers was already a target of the FBI.

25
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:32,000
So what we need is not even more random data, but better ways to understand and use the information we have.

26
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:36,000
Spy agencies are also pushing to cripple encryption.

27
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:43,000
In early 2016, the FBI asked Apple to produce a backdoor program to disable the encryption of a terrorist's iPhone.

28
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:50,000
Apple publicly declined, not only because this tool could be used to permanently weaken the privacy of law-abiding citizens worldwide,

29
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:56,000
but fearing to open the floodgates for governments requesting access to a technology used by billions of people,

30
00:02:56,000 --> 00:03:00,000
a fear shared by security experts and cryptographers.

31
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:05,000
A few weeks later, the FBI revealed that they had hacked the phone themselves,

32
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:08,000
basically admitting that they lied to the public about the need for a backdoor,

33
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:13,000
which questions how trustworthy spy agencies are in the debate about privacy and security,

34
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:19,000
especially considering that the NSA, for example, already has the capability to turn on your iPhone microphone

35
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:23,000
or activate your laptop camera without you noticing.

36
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:29,000
Concerns about this are often met with the argument, if you have nothing to hide, you have nothing to fear.

37
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:32,000
But this reasoning only creates a climate of oppression.

38
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:37,000
Wanting to keep certain parts of your life private doesn't mean you're doing anything wrong.

39
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:40,000
Right now, we live in a democracy.

40
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:46,000
But imagine the damage the wrong person could do with all our data and such easy access to our devices.

41
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:53,000
Anti-terrorism laws allow the authorities to investigate and punish non-terrorism related crimes more aggressively.

42
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:57,000
If you give law enforcement powerful tools, they will use them.

43
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:00,000
That's why democratic oversight is so important.

44
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:05,000
Even if those tools and laws aren't used against you today, they might be tomorrow.

45
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:12,000
For example, following the November 2015 Paris attacks, France expanded its already extensive anti-terrorism laws

46
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:18,000
by giving law enforcement greater powers to conduct house raids and place people under house arrest.

47
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:25,000
Within weeks, evidence emerged that these powers were being used for unintended purposes such as quashing climate change protests.

48
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:32,000
The governments of Spain, Hungary and Poland have introduced more restrictive laws on the freedom of assembly and speech.

49
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:37,000
Freedom of expression in the press in Turkey has been seriously undermined in the last few years,

50
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:41,000
with people sentenced to prison for criticizing the government.

51
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:44,000
None of this is effectively helping us fight terrorism.

52
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:48,000
The motivation behind this might be good, even noble,

53
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:53,000
but if we let our elected governments limit our personal freedom, the terrorists are winning.

54
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:59,000
What's worse, if we're not careful, we might slowly move towards a surveillance state.

55
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,000
The data is pretty clear.

56
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:07,000
The erosion of rights along with mass surveillance hasn't led to significant successes so far,

57
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:10,000
but it has changed the nature of our society.

58
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:16,000
Terrorism is a complicated problem without simple solutions.

59
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:21,000
No security apparatus can prevent a few guys from building a bomb in their basement.

60
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:24,000
We should keep the principle of proportionality in mind.

61
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:30,000
Creating master keys to enter millions of phones is not the same as searching a single house.

62
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:36,000
In most countries, the law already permits a wide range of actions, including targeted surveillance.

63
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:41,000
To take full advantage of this existing potential, we need better international cooperation

64
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:44,000
and more effective security and foreign policies,

65
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:50,000
better application of our present laws instead of new and stricter ones that undermine our freedom.

66
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:59,000
Let us not, out of fear, destroy what we are most proud of, democracy and our fundamental rights and liberties.

67
