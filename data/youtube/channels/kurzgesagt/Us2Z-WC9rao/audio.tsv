0	7340	Here in the Kurzgesagt labs, we test very important ideas to see what happens when you blow things up or play with black holes.
8100	11780	Many of you suggested that we look into an idea that sounds reasonable.
12300	14540	Shooting nuclear waste into space.
14860	20740	It's one of those concepts that seems like an easy fix for one of the main problems with the nuclear energy.
20860	27540	But it turns out this idea is not just bad, but horribly bad, and it gets worse the longer you think about it.
27740	29740	Why is that?
30000	36000	What is nuclear waste?
37000	45000	Nuclear waste is a fuzzy term and comes in categories which vary from country to country.
45000	48000	But in general, there are three broad levels.
48000	58000	90% is low-level nuclear waste, tools, gloves, or trash used at a nuclear facility that could be weakly contaminated with some short-lived radioactivity.
58000	61000	This stuff is generally safe for normal disposal.
61000	71000	7% is intermediate-level nuclear waste, mostly materials that have been in close proximity to a reactor core long enough to become dangerously radioactive.
71000	78000	With proper handling, it's either safely buried or melted down and mixed into glass or concrete and stored deep underground.
78000	83000	So 97% of nuclear waste is similar to toxic byproducts from other industries.
83000	87000	Not great, not terrible. We can handle it.
88000	91000	The remaining 3% is where our problems begin.
91000	97000	High-level nuclear waste is very concentrated spent fuel taken out of a reactor core.
97000	103000	Formerly uranium, it's now made of various dangerous and often highly radioactive elements.
103000	108000	As a bonus, it's also incredibly hot and not easy to handle at all.
108000	111000	This is what we want to shoot into space.
111000	119000	All in all, around 440 active nuclear reactors create about 11,000 tons of high-level nuclear waste each year.
119000	125000	Since 1954, we've accumulated 400,000 tons of dangerous radioactive waste.
125000	130000	Most countries are dealing with it by not dealing with it and kicking the can towards the future.
130000	133000	Great, so let's launch it into space.
134000	142000	According to scientists, space is big and nobody lives there, so it seems perfect for yeeting away this mess.
142000	145000	There are a few tiny problems though.
149000	154000	Even though spaceflight is getting more affordable, it's still extremely expensive.
154000	160000	Just to get something into low Earth orbit costs on average about $4,000 per kilogram.
160000	168000	Putting that into perspective, it costs about $1,600 to mine, separate and fabricate one kilogram of nuclear fuel,
168000	174000	so launching waste into space has suddenly made nuclear fuel for reactors way more expensive
174000	178000	and greatly increased the cost of the electricity they produce.
178000	185000	To launch one reactor's worth of nuclear waste would cost at least $100 million per year.
185000	190000	To deal with all the 440 operational nuclear power plants' high-level nuclear waste
190000	197000	would cost some $44 billion per year for space launch before packaging, transport and security costs are added.
197000	200000	Okay, let's pretend we don't care.
200000	204000	Currently, we couldn't shoot all the nuclear waste into space even if we wanted to.
204000	207000	There just aren't enough rockets.
207000	212000	In 2021, we saw a record 135 launches into space.
212000	216000	If we repurposed each of those rockets and filled them all with nuclear waste,
216000	223000	the total amount that could be lifted into a low Earth orbit, which is the closest orbit above the atmosphere, is nearly 800 tons.
223000	228000	We'd need at least 14 times more rockets to handle just today's nuclear waste,
228000	232000	let alone get rid of the hundreds of thousands of tons in temporary storage.
232000	239000	We would need to create entire new space industries to keep up with the demand for giant, toxic space trash trucks.
239000	242000	And it gets worse.
242000	245000	Problem two, space is hard.
245000	251000	We only made the calculation for low Earth orbit, where we send most of our rockets and satellites.
251000	255000	Littering the space around Earth with thousands of casts of spent nuclear fuel
255000	260000	would be a nightmare for space junk management and satellite collision avoidance.
260000	265000	Worse still, at this altitude, there's still a little bit of atmosphere causing a tiny bit of drag,
265000	269000	so we might have nuclear waste raining down from space within just a few years.
269000	273000	Experts would call this a huge problem.
273000	276000	Clearly, we have to launch our waste further.
276000	281000	If we wanted to send it to, perhaps, the Moon, we either need way more rockets,
281000	285000	or we need to build much bigger ones, making it even more expensive.
285000	289000	A single Saturn V, the rocket used by the Apollo program,
289000	293000	which cost around 1.5 billion adjusted for inflation per launch,
293000	297000	could get about 43.5 tons from the Earth to the Moon.
297000	301000	So we'd need about 260 Saturn V rocket launches every year.
301000	308000	And of course, using the Moon as target practice for nuclear waste-tipped rockets kind of makes a huge mess.
308000	313000	So maybe don't aim for anything. Space is empty. Do we really need a target?
313000	319000	Shooting waste in any random direction is, you guessed it, also a bad idea.
319000	324000	Orbits are loops, which means they have a tendency to come back to where they started.
324000	329000	Put enough in the sky in random directions, and you'll get one back eventually.
329000	333000	So we'd want to launch our nuclear waste deep into space,
333000	337000	which means we need even bigger rockets that would be even more expensive.
337000	340000	Not that we would be completely safe then.
340000	344000	Earth might run into these interplanetary caskets at some time in the far future,
344000	349000	and experience a pretty meteor shower made from radioactive dust.
349000	353000	Okay, how about we shoot it into the Sun?
353000	357000	Ironically, the Sun is pretty hard to hit.
357000	362000	While the Sun has very strong gravity, everything on Earth is moving with respect to the Sun,
362000	364000	including the rockets that we launch,
364000	368000	meaning a rocket would have to cancel out all the orbital motion it has around the Sun,
368000	371000	so it can stop orbiting and fall in.
371000	376000	Because of this, it's actually easier to launch a rocket entirely out of the solar system
376000	379000	than it is to launch it into the Sun.
379000	383000	But to do either of these things, we need even bigger rockets,
383000	385000	probably the biggest we've ever built.
385000	388000	Hmm, nothing works.
388000	392000	The thing is, it gets even worse.
392000	396000	Problem three, rockets go brrr.
396000	400000	Rocket engineering has taken huge steps since the Apollo era.
400000	402000	We've made them relatively safe.
402000	406000	We've mostly replaced the toxic explosive cancer fuels of the past decades
406000	411000	with much saner mixes of liquid, oxygen, and hydrogen or kerosene.
411000	416000	The newest designs even land themselves so that they can be reused.
416000	422000	And yet, out of the 146 launches in 2021, there were 11 failures,
422000	426000	which means that a sizable number of our rockets carrying high-level radioactive waste
426000	431000	would be exploding on the launch pad or, in the worst case, disassembling at high altitude
431000	434000	or crashing from hypersonic speeds.
434000	437000	Each failure would be at least equivalent to a mini Chernobyl,
437000	442000	but instead of being contained under a slab of concrete, spread throughout the atmosphere.
442000	447000	Radioactive particles could make their way to faraway places by riding on the winds.
447000	452000	Most would fall into the ocean, but some would land on the inhabited parts of the world.
452000	458000	They could cover farmlands and get concentrated into our food or enter our water supply,
458000	460000	which is, well, bad.
460000	463000	Imagine regular large-scale nuclear disasters happening.
463000	465000	People wouldn't be happy.
465000	468000	Conclusion and opinion part.
468000	473000	Nuclear waste is scary, but the fear of it and horrible ideas like shooting it into space
473000	476000	reveals how bad we are at understanding risk,
476000	482000	because the largest amounts of radioactive elements like uranium and radon are actually released by coal.
482000	487000	Burning millions of tons of coal each year leaves ash as a waste product
487000	491000	that includes about 36,000 tons of radioactive materials.
491000	496000	Less radioactive than high-level nuclear waste, but there's also a lot more of it,
496000	498000	and it's handled way less carefully.
499000	504000	Some of this ash is caught by filters, but most is simply pushed back into leaky mines,
504000	510000	shoved into piles exposed to the wind, or poured into ponds that regularly spill into rivers and lakes.
510000	518000	Living within 1.6 kilometers of an ash pile increases your cancer risk up to 2,000 times over the acceptable limit,
518000	525000	and this is on top of other toxic chemicals like heavy metals and, of course, their massive CO2 emissions.
525000	531000	And yet, while nuclear energy is flawed and its current form may only be a transitory technology,
531000	534000	nuclear power plants are a harder sell than coal.
534000	539000	Nuclear waste and the lack of willingness to deal with it are a real issue.
539000	541000	It's not insurmountable, though.
541000	548000	There are good methods to handle it, like burying it deep underground or reprocessing some of it into new fuel.
548000	553000	But however we ultimately deal with this issue, we hope one thing is clear.
553000	558000	Shooting nuclear waste into space is one of the worst ideas ever.
559000	565000	Researching this crazy thing, conducting all of these important tests, and, of course, creating this video,
565000	570000	took us around 2,000 hours, which is insane for a YouTube video.
