00:00.000 --> 00:07.340
Here in the Kurzgesagt labs, we test very important ideas to see what happens when you blow things up or play with black holes.

00:08.100 --> 00:11.780
Many of you suggested that we look into an idea that sounds reasonable.

00:12.300 --> 00:14.540
Shooting nuclear waste into space.

00:14.860 --> 00:20.740
It's one of those concepts that seems like an easy fix for one of the main problems with the nuclear energy.

00:20.860 --> 00:27.540
But it turns out this idea is not just bad, but horribly bad, and it gets worse the longer you think about it.

00:27.740 --> 00:29.740
Why is that?

00:30.000 --> 00:36.000
What is nuclear waste?

00:37.000 --> 00:45.000
Nuclear waste is a fuzzy term and comes in categories which vary from country to country.

00:45.000 --> 00:48.000
But in general, there are three broad levels.

00:48.000 --> 00:58.000
90% is low-level nuclear waste, tools, gloves, or trash used at a nuclear facility that could be weakly contaminated with some short-lived radioactivity.

00:58.000 --> 01:01.000
This stuff is generally safe for normal disposal.

01:01.000 --> 01:11.000
7% is intermediate-level nuclear waste, mostly materials that have been in close proximity to a reactor core long enough to become dangerously radioactive.

01:11.000 --> 01:18.000
With proper handling, it's either safely buried or melted down and mixed into glass or concrete and stored deep underground.

01:18.000 --> 01:23.000
So 97% of nuclear waste is similar to toxic byproducts from other industries.

01:23.000 --> 01:27.000
Not great, not terrible. We can handle it.

01:28.000 --> 01:31.000
The remaining 3% is where our problems begin.

01:31.000 --> 01:37.000
High-level nuclear waste is very concentrated spent fuel taken out of a reactor core.

01:37.000 --> 01:43.000
Formerly uranium, it's now made of various dangerous and often highly radioactive elements.

01:43.000 --> 01:48.000
As a bonus, it's also incredibly hot and not easy to handle at all.

01:48.000 --> 01:51.000
This is what we want to shoot into space.

01:51.000 --> 01:59.000
All in all, around 440 active nuclear reactors create about 11,000 tons of high-level nuclear waste each year.

01:59.000 --> 02:05.000
Since 1954, we've accumulated 400,000 tons of dangerous radioactive waste.

02:05.000 --> 02:10.000
Most countries are dealing with it by not dealing with it and kicking the can towards the future.

02:10.000 --> 02:13.000
Great, so let's launch it into space.

02:14.000 --> 02:22.000
According to scientists, space is big and nobody lives there, so it seems perfect for yeeting away this mess.

02:22.000 --> 02:25.000
There are a few tiny problems though.

02:29.000 --> 02:34.000
Even though spaceflight is getting more affordable, it's still extremely expensive.

02:34.000 --> 02:40.000
Just to get something into low Earth orbit costs on average about $4,000 per kilogram.

02:40.000 --> 02:48.000
Putting that into perspective, it costs about $1,600 to mine, separate and fabricate one kilogram of nuclear fuel,

02:48.000 --> 02:54.000
so launching waste into space has suddenly made nuclear fuel for reactors way more expensive

02:54.000 --> 02:58.000
and greatly increased the cost of the electricity they produce.

02:58.000 --> 03:05.000
To launch one reactor's worth of nuclear waste would cost at least $100 million per year.

03:05.000 --> 03:10.000
To deal with all the 440 operational nuclear power plants' high-level nuclear waste

03:10.000 --> 03:17.000
would cost some $44 billion per year for space launch before packaging, transport and security costs are added.

03:17.000 --> 03:20.000
Okay, let's pretend we don't care.

03:20.000 --> 03:24.000
Currently, we couldn't shoot all the nuclear waste into space even if we wanted to.

03:24.000 --> 03:27.000
There just aren't enough rockets.

03:27.000 --> 03:32.000
In 2021, we saw a record 135 launches into space.

03:32.000 --> 03:36.000
If we repurposed each of those rockets and filled them all with nuclear waste,

03:36.000 --> 03:43.000
the total amount that could be lifted into a low Earth orbit, which is the closest orbit above the atmosphere, is nearly 800 tons.

03:43.000 --> 03:48.000
We'd need at least 14 times more rockets to handle just today's nuclear waste,

03:48.000 --> 03:52.000
let alone get rid of the hundreds of thousands of tons in temporary storage.

03:52.000 --> 03:59.000
We would need to create entire new space industries to keep up with the demand for giant, toxic space trash trucks.

03:59.000 --> 04:02.000
And it gets worse.

04:02.000 --> 04:05.000
Problem two, space is hard.

04:05.000 --> 04:11.000
We only made the calculation for low Earth orbit, where we send most of our rockets and satellites.

04:11.000 --> 04:15.000
Littering the space around Earth with thousands of casts of spent nuclear fuel

04:15.000 --> 04:20.000
would be a nightmare for space junk management and satellite collision avoidance.

04:20.000 --> 04:25.000
Worse still, at this altitude, there's still a little bit of atmosphere causing a tiny bit of drag,

04:25.000 --> 04:29.000
so we might have nuclear waste raining down from space within just a few years.

04:29.000 --> 04:33.000
Experts would call this a huge problem.

04:33.000 --> 04:36.000
Clearly, we have to launch our waste further.

04:36.000 --> 04:41.000
If we wanted to send it to, perhaps, the Moon, we either need way more rockets,

04:41.000 --> 04:45.000
or we need to build much bigger ones, making it even more expensive.

04:45.000 --> 04:49.000
A single Saturn V, the rocket used by the Apollo program,

04:49.000 --> 04:53.000
which cost around 1.5 billion adjusted for inflation per launch,

04:53.000 --> 04:57.000
could get about 43.5 tons from the Earth to the Moon.

04:57.000 --> 05:01.000
So we'd need about 260 Saturn V rocket launches every year.

05:01.000 --> 05:08.000
And of course, using the Moon as target practice for nuclear waste-tipped rockets kind of makes a huge mess.

05:08.000 --> 05:13.000
So maybe don't aim for anything. Space is empty. Do we really need a target?

05:13.000 --> 05:19.000
Shooting waste in any random direction is, you guessed it, also a bad idea.

05:19.000 --> 05:24.000
Orbits are loops, which means they have a tendency to come back to where they started.

05:24.000 --> 05:29.000
Put enough in the sky in random directions, and you'll get one back eventually.

05:29.000 --> 05:33.000
So we'd want to launch our nuclear waste deep into space,

05:33.000 --> 05:37.000
which means we need even bigger rockets that would be even more expensive.

05:37.000 --> 05:40.000
Not that we would be completely safe then.

05:40.000 --> 05:44.000
Earth might run into these interplanetary caskets at some time in the far future,

05:44.000 --> 05:49.000
and experience a pretty meteor shower made from radioactive dust.

05:49.000 --> 05:53.000
Okay, how about we shoot it into the Sun?

05:53.000 --> 05:57.000
Ironically, the Sun is pretty hard to hit.

05:57.000 --> 06:02.000
While the Sun has very strong gravity, everything on Earth is moving with respect to the Sun,

06:02.000 --> 06:04.000
including the rockets that we launch,

06:04.000 --> 06:08.000
meaning a rocket would have to cancel out all the orbital motion it has around the Sun,

06:08.000 --> 06:11.000
so it can stop orbiting and fall in.

06:11.000 --> 06:16.000
Because of this, it's actually easier to launch a rocket entirely out of the solar system

06:16.000 --> 06:19.000
than it is to launch it into the Sun.

06:19.000 --> 06:23.000
But to do either of these things, we need even bigger rockets,

06:23.000 --> 06:25.000
probably the biggest we've ever built.

06:25.000 --> 06:28.000
Hmm, nothing works.

06:28.000 --> 06:32.000
The thing is, it gets even worse.

06:32.000 --> 06:36.000
Problem three, rockets go brrr.

06:36.000 --> 06:40.000
Rocket engineering has taken huge steps since the Apollo era.

06:40.000 --> 06:42.000
We've made them relatively safe.

06:42.000 --> 06:46.000
We've mostly replaced the toxic explosive cancer fuels of the past decades

06:46.000 --> 06:51.000
with much saner mixes of liquid, oxygen, and hydrogen or kerosene.

06:51.000 --> 06:56.000
The newest designs even land themselves so that they can be reused.

06:56.000 --> 07:02.000
And yet, out of the 146 launches in 2021, there were 11 failures,

07:02.000 --> 07:06.000
which means that a sizable number of our rockets carrying high-level radioactive waste

07:06.000 --> 07:11.000
would be exploding on the launch pad or, in the worst case, disassembling at high altitude

07:11.000 --> 07:14.000
or crashing from hypersonic speeds.

07:14.000 --> 07:17.000
Each failure would be at least equivalent to a mini Chernobyl,

07:17.000 --> 07:22.000
but instead of being contained under a slab of concrete, spread throughout the atmosphere.

07:22.000 --> 07:27.000
Radioactive particles could make their way to faraway places by riding on the winds.

07:27.000 --> 07:32.000
Most would fall into the ocean, but some would land on the inhabited parts of the world.

07:32.000 --> 07:38.000
They could cover farmlands and get concentrated into our food or enter our water supply,

07:38.000 --> 07:40.000
which is, well, bad.

07:40.000 --> 07:43.000
Imagine regular large-scale nuclear disasters happening.

07:43.000 --> 07:45.000
People wouldn't be happy.

07:45.000 --> 07:48.000
Conclusion and opinion part.

07:48.000 --> 07:53.000
Nuclear waste is scary, but the fear of it and horrible ideas like shooting it into space

07:53.000 --> 07:56.000
reveals how bad we are at understanding risk,

07:56.000 --> 08:02.000
because the largest amounts of radioactive elements like uranium and radon are actually released by coal.

08:02.000 --> 08:07.000
Burning millions of tons of coal each year leaves ash as a waste product

08:07.000 --> 08:11.000
that includes about 36,000 tons of radioactive materials.

08:11.000 --> 08:16.000
Less radioactive than high-level nuclear waste, but there's also a lot more of it,

08:16.000 --> 08:18.000
and it's handled way less carefully.

08:19.000 --> 08:24.000
Some of this ash is caught by filters, but most is simply pushed back into leaky mines,

08:24.000 --> 08:30.000
shoved into piles exposed to the wind, or poured into ponds that regularly spill into rivers and lakes.

08:30.000 --> 08:38.000
Living within 1.6 kilometers of an ash pile increases your cancer risk up to 2,000 times over the acceptable limit,

08:38.000 --> 08:45.000
and this is on top of other toxic chemicals like heavy metals and, of course, their massive CO2 emissions.

08:45.000 --> 08:51.000
And yet, while nuclear energy is flawed and its current form may only be a transitory technology,

08:51.000 --> 08:54.000
nuclear power plants are a harder sell than coal.

08:54.000 --> 08:59.000
Nuclear waste and the lack of willingness to deal with it are a real issue.

08:59.000 --> 09:01.000
It's not insurmountable, though.

09:01.000 --> 09:08.000
There are good methods to handle it, like burying it deep underground or reprocessing some of it into new fuel.

09:08.000 --> 09:13.000
But however we ultimately deal with this issue, we hope one thing is clear.

09:13.000 --> 09:18.000
Shooting nuclear waste into space is one of the worst ideas ever.

09:19.000 --> 09:25.000
Researching this crazy thing, conducting all of these important tests, and, of course, creating this video,

09:25.000 --> 09:30.000
took us around 2,000 hours, which is insane for a YouTube video.

09:30.000 --> 09:33.000
