1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,340
Here in the Kurzgesagt labs, we test very important ideas to see what happens when you blow things up or play with black holes.

2
00:00:08,100 --> 00:00:11,780
Many of you suggested that we look into an idea that sounds reasonable.

3
00:00:12,300 --> 00:00:14,540
Shooting nuclear waste into space.

4
00:00:14,860 --> 00:00:20,740
It's one of those concepts that seems like an easy fix for one of the main problems with the nuclear energy.

5
00:00:20,860 --> 00:00:27,540
But it turns out this idea is not just bad, but horribly bad, and it gets worse the longer you think about it.

6
00:00:27,740 --> 00:00:29,740
Why is that?

7
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:36,000
What is nuclear waste?

8
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:45,000
Nuclear waste is a fuzzy term and comes in categories which vary from country to country.

9
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:48,000
But in general, there are three broad levels.

10
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:58,000
90% is low-level nuclear waste, tools, gloves, or trash used at a nuclear facility that could be weakly contaminated with some short-lived radioactivity.

11
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:01,000
This stuff is generally safe for normal disposal.

12
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:11,000
7% is intermediate-level nuclear waste, mostly materials that have been in close proximity to a reactor core long enough to become dangerously radioactive.

13
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:18,000
With proper handling, it's either safely buried or melted down and mixed into glass or concrete and stored deep underground.

14
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:23,000
So 97% of nuclear waste is similar to toxic byproducts from other industries.

15
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:27,000
Not great, not terrible. We can handle it.

16
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:31,000
The remaining 3% is where our problems begin.

17
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:37,000
High-level nuclear waste is very concentrated spent fuel taken out of a reactor core.

18
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:43,000
Formerly uranium, it's now made of various dangerous and often highly radioactive elements.

19
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:48,000
As a bonus, it's also incredibly hot and not easy to handle at all.

20
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:51,000
This is what we want to shoot into space.

21
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:59,000
All in all, around 440 active nuclear reactors create about 11,000 tons of high-level nuclear waste each year.

22
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:05,000
Since 1954, we've accumulated 400,000 tons of dangerous radioactive waste.

23
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:10,000
Most countries are dealing with it by not dealing with it and kicking the can towards the future.

24
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:13,000
Great, so let's launch it into space.

25
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:22,000
According to scientists, space is big and nobody lives there, so it seems perfect for yeeting away this mess.

26
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:25,000
There are a few tiny problems though.

27
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:34,000
Even though spaceflight is getting more affordable, it's still extremely expensive.

28
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:40,000
Just to get something into low Earth orbit costs on average about $4,000 per kilogram.

29
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:48,000
Putting that into perspective, it costs about $1,600 to mine, separate and fabricate one kilogram of nuclear fuel,

30
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:54,000
so launching waste into space has suddenly made nuclear fuel for reactors way more expensive

31
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:58,000
and greatly increased the cost of the electricity they produce.

32
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:05,000
To launch one reactor's worth of nuclear waste would cost at least $100 million per year.

33
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:10,000
To deal with all the 440 operational nuclear power plants' high-level nuclear waste

34
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:17,000
would cost some $44 billion per year for space launch before packaging, transport and security costs are added.

35
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:20,000
Okay, let's pretend we don't care.

36
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:24,000
Currently, we couldn't shoot all the nuclear waste into space even if we wanted to.

37
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:27,000
There just aren't enough rockets.

38
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:32,000
In 2021, we saw a record 135 launches into space.

39
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:36,000
If we repurposed each of those rockets and filled them all with nuclear waste,

40
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:43,000
the total amount that could be lifted into a low Earth orbit, which is the closest orbit above the atmosphere, is nearly 800 tons.

41
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:48,000
We'd need at least 14 times more rockets to handle just today's nuclear waste,

42
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:52,000
let alone get rid of the hundreds of thousands of tons in temporary storage.

43
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:59,000
We would need to create entire new space industries to keep up with the demand for giant, toxic space trash trucks.

44
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:02,000
And it gets worse.

45
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:05,000
Problem two, space is hard.

46
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:11,000
We only made the calculation for low Earth orbit, where we send most of our rockets and satellites.

47
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:15,000
Littering the space around Earth with thousands of casts of spent nuclear fuel

48
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:20,000
would be a nightmare for space junk management and satellite collision avoidance.

49
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:25,000
Worse still, at this altitude, there's still a little bit of atmosphere causing a tiny bit of drag,

50
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:29,000
so we might have nuclear waste raining down from space within just a few years.

51
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:33,000
Experts would call this a huge problem.

52
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:36,000
Clearly, we have to launch our waste further.

53
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:41,000
If we wanted to send it to, perhaps, the Moon, we either need way more rockets,

54
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:45,000
or we need to build much bigger ones, making it even more expensive.

55
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:49,000
A single Saturn V, the rocket used by the Apollo program,

56
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:53,000
which cost around 1.5 billion adjusted for inflation per launch,

57
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:57,000
could get about 43.5 tons from the Earth to the Moon.

58
00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:01,000
So we'd need about 260 Saturn V rocket launches every year.

59
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:08,000
And of course, using the Moon as target practice for nuclear waste-tipped rockets kind of makes a huge mess.

60
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:13,000
So maybe don't aim for anything. Space is empty. Do we really need a target?

61
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:19,000
Shooting waste in any random direction is, you guessed it, also a bad idea.

62
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:24,000
Orbits are loops, which means they have a tendency to come back to where they started.

63
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:29,000
Put enough in the sky in random directions, and you'll get one back eventually.

64
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:33,000
So we'd want to launch our nuclear waste deep into space,

65
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:37,000
which means we need even bigger rockets that would be even more expensive.

66
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:40,000
Not that we would be completely safe then.

67
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:44,000
Earth might run into these interplanetary caskets at some time in the far future,

68
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:49,000
and experience a pretty meteor shower made from radioactive dust.

69
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:53,000
Okay, how about we shoot it into the Sun?

70
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:57,000
Ironically, the Sun is pretty hard to hit.

71
00:05:57,000 --> 00:06:02,000
While the Sun has very strong gravity, everything on Earth is moving with respect to the Sun,

72
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:04,000
including the rockets that we launch,

73
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:08,000
meaning a rocket would have to cancel out all the orbital motion it has around the Sun,

74
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:11,000
so it can stop orbiting and fall in.

75
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:16,000
Because of this, it's actually easier to launch a rocket entirely out of the solar system

76
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:19,000
than it is to launch it into the Sun.

77
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:23,000
But to do either of these things, we need even bigger rockets,

78
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:25,000
probably the biggest we've ever built.

79
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:28,000
Hmm, nothing works.

80
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:32,000
The thing is, it gets even worse.

81
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:36,000
Problem three, rockets go brrr.

82
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:40,000
Rocket engineering has taken huge steps since the Apollo era.

83
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:42,000
We've made them relatively safe.

84
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:46,000
We've mostly replaced the toxic explosive cancer fuels of the past decades

85
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:51,000
with much saner mixes of liquid, oxygen, and hydrogen or kerosene.

86
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:56,000
The newest designs even land themselves so that they can be reused.

87
00:06:56,000 --> 00:07:02,000
And yet, out of the 146 launches in 2021, there were 11 failures,

88
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:06,000
which means that a sizable number of our rockets carrying high-level radioactive waste

89
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:11,000
would be exploding on the launch pad or, in the worst case, disassembling at high altitude

90
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:14,000
or crashing from hypersonic speeds.

91
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:17,000
Each failure would be at least equivalent to a mini Chernobyl,

92
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:22,000
but instead of being contained under a slab of concrete, spread throughout the atmosphere.

93
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:27,000
Radioactive particles could make their way to faraway places by riding on the winds.

94
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:32,000
Most would fall into the ocean, but some would land on the inhabited parts of the world.

95
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:38,000
They could cover farmlands and get concentrated into our food or enter our water supply,

96
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:40,000
which is, well, bad.

97
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:43,000
Imagine regular large-scale nuclear disasters happening.

98
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:45,000
People wouldn't be happy.

99
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:48,000
Conclusion and opinion part.

100
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:53,000
Nuclear waste is scary, but the fear of it and horrible ideas like shooting it into space

101
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:56,000
reveals how bad we are at understanding risk,

102
00:07:56,000 --> 00:08:02,000
because the largest amounts of radioactive elements like uranium and radon are actually released by coal.

103
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:07,000
Burning millions of tons of coal each year leaves ash as a waste product

104
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:11,000
that includes about 36,000 tons of radioactive materials.

105
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:16,000
Less radioactive than high-level nuclear waste, but there's also a lot more of it,

106
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:18,000
and it's handled way less carefully.

107
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:24,000
Some of this ash is caught by filters, but most is simply pushed back into leaky mines,

108
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:30,000
shoved into piles exposed to the wind, or poured into ponds that regularly spill into rivers and lakes.

109
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:38,000
Living within 1.6 kilometers of an ash pile increases your cancer risk up to 2,000 times over the acceptable limit,

110
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:45,000
and this is on top of other toxic chemicals like heavy metals and, of course, their massive CO2 emissions.

111
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:51,000
And yet, while nuclear energy is flawed and its current form may only be a transitory technology,

112
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:54,000
nuclear power plants are a harder sell than coal.

113
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:59,000
Nuclear waste and the lack of willingness to deal with it are a real issue.

114
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:01,000
It's not insurmountable, though.

115
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:08,000
There are good methods to handle it, like burying it deep underground or reprocessing some of it into new fuel.

116
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:13,000
But however we ultimately deal with this issue, we hope one thing is clear.

117
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:18,000
Shooting nuclear waste into space is one of the worst ideas ever.

118
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:25,000
Researching this crazy thing, conducting all of these important tests, and, of course, creating this video,

119
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:30,000
took us around 2,000 hours, which is insane for a YouTube video.

120
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:33,000
