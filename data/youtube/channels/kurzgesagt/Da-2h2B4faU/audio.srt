1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
What is the true nature of the universe?

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:09,000
To answer this question, humans come up with stories to describe the world.

3
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:14,000
We test our stories and learn what to keep and what to throw away.

4
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:19,000
But the more we learn, the more complicated and weird our stories become.

5
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:25,000
Some of them so much so that it's really hard to know what they're actually about.

6
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:32,000
Like String Theory, a famous, controversial, and often misunderstood story about the nature of everything.

7
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:38,000
Why did we come up with it, and is it correct, or just an idea we should chuck out?

8
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:52,000
To understand the true nature of reality, we looked at things up close and were amazed.

9
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:55,000
Wondrous landscapes in the dust.

10
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:57,000
Zoos of bizarre creatures.

11
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:59,000
Complex protein robots.

12
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:05,000
All of them made from structures of molecules made up of countless, even smaller things, atoms.

13
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:10,000
We thought they were the final layer of reality until we smashed them together really hard

14
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:14,000
and discovered things that can't be divided anymore.

15
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,000
Elementary particles.

16
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,000
But now we had a problem.

17
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:21,000
They're so small that we could no longer look at them.

18
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:24,000
Think about it. What is seeing?

19
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:28,000
To see something, we need light, an electromagnetic wave.

20
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:33,000
This wave hits the surface of the thing and gets reflected back from it into your eye.

21
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:38,000
The wave carries information from the object that your brain uses to create an image.

22
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:42,000
So you can't see something without somehow interacting with it.

23
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:47,000
Seeing is touching. An active process, not a passive one.

24
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:50,000
This is not a problem with most things.

25
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:53,000
But particles are very, very, very small.

26
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:58,000
So small that the electromagnetic waves we use to see are too big to touch them.

27
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:01,000
Visible light just passes over them.

28
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:07,000
We can try to solve this by creating electromagnetic waves with more and much smaller wavelengths.

29
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:10,000
But in quantum physics, shorter wavelengths means more energy.

30
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:15,000
So when we touch a particle with a wave that has a lot of energy, it gets a kick.

31
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:17,000
By looking at a particle, we change it.

32
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:22,000
In quantum physics, we cannot know where a particle is and where it's going with absolute precision.

33
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:25,000
This fact is so important that it has a name.

34
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:30,000
The Heisenberg uncertainty principle, the basis of all quantum physics.

35
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:33,000
So what does a particle look like then?

36
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:35,000
What is its nature?

37
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:37,000
We don't know.

38
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:43,000
If we look really hard, we can see a blurry sphere of influence, but not the particles themselves.

39
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:46,000
We just know they exist.

40
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:50,000
But if that's the case, how can we do any science with them?

41
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:55,000
We did what humans do and invented a new story, a mathematical fiction.

42
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:58,000
The story of the point particle.

43
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:02,000
We decided that we would pretend that a particle is a point in space.

44
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:09,000
Any electron is a point with a certain electric charge and a certain mass, all indistinguishable from each other.

45
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:14,000
This way, physicists could define them and calculate all of their interactions.

46
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:19,000
This can be made precise in quantum field theory, and this solved a lot of problems.

47
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:25,000
All of the standard model of particle physics is built on it, and it predicts lots of things very well.

48
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:36,000
Some quantum properties of the electron, for example, have been tested and are accurate up to 0.000002%.

49
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:43,000
So while particles are not really points, by treating them as if they were, we get a pretty good picture of the universe.

50
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:50,000
Not only did this idea advance science, it also led to a lot of real-world technology we use every day.

51
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:53,000
But there's a huge problem, gravity.

52
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:58,000
In quantum mechanics, all physical forces are carried by certain particles.

53
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:05,000
But according to Einstein's general relativity, gravity is not a force like the others in the universe.

54
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:11,000
If the universe is a play, particles are the actors, but gravity is the stage.

55
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:17,000
To put it simply, gravity is a theory of geometry, the geometry of space-time itself,

56
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:21,000
of distances which we need to describe with absolute precision.

57
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:25,000
But since there is no way to precisely measure things in the quantum world,

58
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:29,000
our story of gravity doesn't work with our story of quantum physics.

59
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:36,000
When physicists tried to add gravity to the story by inventing a new particle, their mathematics broke down.

60
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,000
And this is a big problem.

61
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:45,000
If we could marry gravity to quantum physics and the standard model, we would have the theory of everything.

62
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:48,000
So very smart people came up with a new story.

63
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:54,000
They asked, what is more complex than a point, a line, or a string?

64
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,000
String theory was born.

65
00:04:56,000 --> 00:05:04,000
What makes string theory so elegant is that it describes many different elementary particles as different modes of vibration of the string.

66
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:11,000
Just like a violin string vibrating differently can give you a lot of different notes, a string can give you different particles.

67
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:14,000
Most importantly, this includes gravity.

68
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:20,000
String theory promised to unify all fundamental forces of the universe.

69
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:23,000
This caused enormous excitement and hype.

70
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:27,000
String theory quickly graduated to a possible theory of everything.

71
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:32,000
Unfortunately, string theory comes with a lot of strings attached.

72
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:41,000
Much of the maths involving a consistent string theory does not work in our universe with its three spatial and one temporal dimensions.

73
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:44,000
String theory requires ten dimensions to work out.

74
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:48,000
So string theorists did calculations in model universes.

75
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:53,000
And then tried to get rid of the six additional dimensions and describe our own universe.

76
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:59,000
But so far, nobody has succeeded and no prediction of string theory has been proven in an experiment.

77
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:03,000
So string theory did not reveal the nature of our universe.

78
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:08,000
One could argue that in this case, string theory really isn't useful at all.

79
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:11,000
Science is all about experiments and predictions.

80
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:15,000
If we can't do those, why should we bother with strings?

81
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:18,000
It really is all about how we use it.

82
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:20,000
Physics is based on maths.

83
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:22,000
Two plus two makes four.

84
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:25,000
This is true no matter how you feel about it.

85
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:28,000
And the maths in string theory does work out.

86
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:31,000
That's why string theory is still useful.

87
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:36,000
Imagine that you want to build a cruise ship, but you only have blueprints for a small rowing boat.

88
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:38,000
There are plenty of differences.

89
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:41,000
The engine, the materials, the scale.

90
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:44,000
But both things are fundamentally the same.

91
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,000
Things that float.

92
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:53,000
So by studying the rowing boat blueprints, you might still learn something about how to build a cruise ship eventually.

93
00:06:54,000 --> 00:07:00,000
With string theory, we can try to answer some questions about quantum gravity that have been puzzling physicists for decades,

94
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:04,000
such as how black holes work or the information paradox.

95
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:07,000
String theory may point us in the right direction.

96
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:12,000
When used in this spirit, string theory becomes a precious tool for theoretical physicists

97
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:17,000
and help them discover new aspects of the quantum world and some beautiful mathematics.

98
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:22,000
So maybe the story of string theory is not the theory of everything.

99
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:27,000
But just like the story of the point particle, it may be an extremely useful story.

100
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:30,000
We don't yet know what the true nature of reality is,

101
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:37,000
but we'll keep coming up with stories to try and find out until one day, hopefully, we do know.
