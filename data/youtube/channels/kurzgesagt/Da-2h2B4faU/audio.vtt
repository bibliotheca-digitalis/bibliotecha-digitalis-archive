00:00.000 --> 00:04.000
What is the true nature of the universe?

00:04.000 --> 00:09.000
To answer this question, humans come up with stories to describe the world.

00:09.000 --> 00:14.000
We test our stories and learn what to keep and what to throw away.

00:14.000 --> 00:19.000
But the more we learn, the more complicated and weird our stories become.

00:19.000 --> 00:25.000
Some of them so much so that it's really hard to know what they're actually about.

00:25.000 --> 00:32.000
Like String Theory, a famous, controversial, and often misunderstood story about the nature of everything.

00:32.000 --> 00:38.000
Why did we come up with it, and is it correct, or just an idea we should chuck out?

00:47.000 --> 00:52.000
To understand the true nature of reality, we looked at things up close and were amazed.

00:53.000 --> 00:55.000
Wondrous landscapes in the dust.

00:55.000 --> 00:57.000
Zoos of bizarre creatures.

00:57.000 --> 00:59.000
Complex protein robots.

00:59.000 --> 01:05.000
All of them made from structures of molecules made up of countless, even smaller things, atoms.

01:05.000 --> 01:10.000
We thought they were the final layer of reality until we smashed them together really hard

01:10.000 --> 01:14.000
and discovered things that can't be divided anymore.

01:14.000 --> 01:16.000
Elementary particles.

01:16.000 --> 01:18.000
But now we had a problem.

01:18.000 --> 01:21.000
They're so small that we could no longer look at them.

01:21.000 --> 01:24.000
Think about it. What is seeing?

01:24.000 --> 01:28.000
To see something, we need light, an electromagnetic wave.

01:28.000 --> 01:33.000
This wave hits the surface of the thing and gets reflected back from it into your eye.

01:33.000 --> 01:38.000
The wave carries information from the object that your brain uses to create an image.

01:38.000 --> 01:42.000
So you can't see something without somehow interacting with it.

01:42.000 --> 01:47.000
Seeing is touching. An active process, not a passive one.

01:47.000 --> 01:50.000
This is not a problem with most things.

01:50.000 --> 01:53.000
But particles are very, very, very small.

01:53.000 --> 01:58.000
So small that the electromagnetic waves we use to see are too big to touch them.

01:58.000 --> 02:01.000
Visible light just passes over them.

02:01.000 --> 02:07.000
We can try to solve this by creating electromagnetic waves with more and much smaller wavelengths.

02:07.000 --> 02:10.000
But in quantum physics, shorter wavelengths means more energy.

02:10.000 --> 02:15.000
So when we touch a particle with a wave that has a lot of energy, it gets a kick.

02:15.000 --> 02:17.000
By looking at a particle, we change it.

02:17.000 --> 02:22.000
In quantum physics, we cannot know where a particle is and where it's going with absolute precision.

02:22.000 --> 02:25.000
This fact is so important that it has a name.

02:25.000 --> 02:30.000
The Heisenberg uncertainty principle, the basis of all quantum physics.

02:30.000 --> 02:33.000
So what does a particle look like then?

02:33.000 --> 02:35.000
What is its nature?

02:35.000 --> 02:37.000
We don't know.

02:37.000 --> 02:43.000
If we look really hard, we can see a blurry sphere of influence, but not the particles themselves.

02:43.000 --> 02:46.000
We just know they exist.

02:46.000 --> 02:50.000
But if that's the case, how can we do any science with them?

02:50.000 --> 02:55.000
We did what humans do and invented a new story, a mathematical fiction.

02:55.000 --> 02:58.000
The story of the point particle.

02:58.000 --> 03:02.000
We decided that we would pretend that a particle is a point in space.

03:02.000 --> 03:09.000
Any electron is a point with a certain electric charge and a certain mass, all indistinguishable from each other.

03:09.000 --> 03:14.000
This way, physicists could define them and calculate all of their interactions.

03:14.000 --> 03:19.000
This can be made precise in quantum field theory, and this solved a lot of problems.

03:19.000 --> 03:25.000
All of the standard model of particle physics is built on it, and it predicts lots of things very well.

03:25.000 --> 03:36.000
Some quantum properties of the electron, for example, have been tested and are accurate up to 0.000002%.

03:36.000 --> 03:43.000
So while particles are not really points, by treating them as if they were, we get a pretty good picture of the universe.

03:43.000 --> 03:50.000
Not only did this idea advance science, it also led to a lot of real-world technology we use every day.

03:50.000 --> 03:53.000
But there's a huge problem, gravity.

03:53.000 --> 03:58.000
In quantum mechanics, all physical forces are carried by certain particles.

03:58.000 --> 04:05.000
But according to Einstein's general relativity, gravity is not a force like the others in the universe.

04:05.000 --> 04:11.000
If the universe is a play, particles are the actors, but gravity is the stage.

04:11.000 --> 04:17.000
To put it simply, gravity is a theory of geometry, the geometry of space-time itself,

04:17.000 --> 04:21.000
of distances which we need to describe with absolute precision.

04:21.000 --> 04:25.000
But since there is no way to precisely measure things in the quantum world,

04:25.000 --> 04:29.000
our story of gravity doesn't work with our story of quantum physics.

04:29.000 --> 04:36.000
When physicists tried to add gravity to the story by inventing a new particle, their mathematics broke down.

04:36.000 --> 04:38.000
And this is a big problem.

04:39.000 --> 04:45.000
If we could marry gravity to quantum physics and the standard model, we would have the theory of everything.

04:45.000 --> 04:48.000
So very smart people came up with a new story.

04:48.000 --> 04:54.000
They asked, what is more complex than a point, a line, or a string?

04:54.000 --> 04:56.000
String theory was born.

04:56.000 --> 05:04.000
What makes string theory so elegant is that it describes many different elementary particles as different modes of vibration of the string.

05:05.000 --> 05:11.000
Just like a violin string vibrating differently can give you a lot of different notes, a string can give you different particles.

05:11.000 --> 05:14.000
Most importantly, this includes gravity.

05:16.000 --> 05:20.000
String theory promised to unify all fundamental forces of the universe.

05:20.000 --> 05:23.000
This caused enormous excitement and hype.

05:23.000 --> 05:27.000
String theory quickly graduated to a possible theory of everything.

05:27.000 --> 05:32.000
Unfortunately, string theory comes with a lot of strings attached.

05:33.000 --> 05:41.000
Much of the maths involving a consistent string theory does not work in our universe with its three spatial and one temporal dimensions.

05:41.000 --> 05:44.000
String theory requires ten dimensions to work out.

05:44.000 --> 05:48.000
So string theorists did calculations in model universes.

05:48.000 --> 05:53.000
And then tried to get rid of the six additional dimensions and describe our own universe.

05:53.000 --> 05:59.000
But so far, nobody has succeeded and no prediction of string theory has been proven in an experiment.

05:59.000 --> 06:03.000
So string theory did not reveal the nature of our universe.

06:03.000 --> 06:08.000
One could argue that in this case, string theory really isn't useful at all.

06:08.000 --> 06:11.000
Science is all about experiments and predictions.

06:11.000 --> 06:15.000
If we can't do those, why should we bother with strings?

06:15.000 --> 06:18.000
It really is all about how we use it.

06:18.000 --> 06:20.000
Physics is based on maths.

06:20.000 --> 06:22.000
Two plus two makes four.

06:22.000 --> 06:25.000
This is true no matter how you feel about it.

06:25.000 --> 06:28.000
And the maths in string theory does work out.

06:28.000 --> 06:31.000
That's why string theory is still useful.

06:31.000 --> 06:36.000
Imagine that you want to build a cruise ship, but you only have blueprints for a small rowing boat.

06:36.000 --> 06:38.000
There are plenty of differences.

06:38.000 --> 06:41.000
The engine, the materials, the scale.

06:41.000 --> 06:44.000
But both things are fundamentally the same.

06:44.000 --> 06:46.000
Things that float.

06:47.000 --> 06:53.000
So by studying the rowing boat blueprints, you might still learn something about how to build a cruise ship eventually.

06:54.000 --> 07:00.000
With string theory, we can try to answer some questions about quantum gravity that have been puzzling physicists for decades,

07:00.000 --> 07:04.000
such as how black holes work or the information paradox.

07:04.000 --> 07:07.000
String theory may point us in the right direction.

07:07.000 --> 07:12.000
When used in this spirit, string theory becomes a precious tool for theoretical physicists

07:12.000 --> 07:17.000
and help them discover new aspects of the quantum world and some beautiful mathematics.

07:17.000 --> 07:22.000
So maybe the story of string theory is not the theory of everything.

07:22.000 --> 07:27.000
But just like the story of the point particle, it may be an extremely useful story.

07:27.000 --> 07:30.000
We don't yet know what the true nature of reality is,

07:30.000 --> 07:37.000
but we'll keep coming up with stories to try and find out until one day, hopefully, we do know.
