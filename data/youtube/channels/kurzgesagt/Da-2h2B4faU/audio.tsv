0	4000	What is the true nature of the universe?
4000	9000	To answer this question, humans come up with stories to describe the world.
9000	14000	We test our stories and learn what to keep and what to throw away.
14000	19000	But the more we learn, the more complicated and weird our stories become.
19000	25000	Some of them so much so that it's really hard to know what they're actually about.
25000	32000	Like String Theory, a famous, controversial, and often misunderstood story about the nature of everything.
32000	38000	Why did we come up with it, and is it correct, or just an idea we should chuck out?
47000	52000	To understand the true nature of reality, we looked at things up close and were amazed.
53000	55000	Wondrous landscapes in the dust.
55000	57000	Zoos of bizarre creatures.
57000	59000	Complex protein robots.
59000	65000	All of them made from structures of molecules made up of countless, even smaller things, atoms.
65000	70000	We thought they were the final layer of reality until we smashed them together really hard
70000	74000	and discovered things that can't be divided anymore.
74000	76000	Elementary particles.
76000	78000	But now we had a problem.
78000	81000	They're so small that we could no longer look at them.
81000	84000	Think about it. What is seeing?
84000	88000	To see something, we need light, an electromagnetic wave.
88000	93000	This wave hits the surface of the thing and gets reflected back from it into your eye.
93000	98000	The wave carries information from the object that your brain uses to create an image.
98000	102000	So you can't see something without somehow interacting with it.
102000	107000	Seeing is touching. An active process, not a passive one.
107000	110000	This is not a problem with most things.
110000	113000	But particles are very, very, very small.
113000	118000	So small that the electromagnetic waves we use to see are too big to touch them.
118000	121000	Visible light just passes over them.
121000	127000	We can try to solve this by creating electromagnetic waves with more and much smaller wavelengths.
127000	130000	But in quantum physics, shorter wavelengths means more energy.
130000	135000	So when we touch a particle with a wave that has a lot of energy, it gets a kick.
135000	137000	By looking at a particle, we change it.
137000	142000	In quantum physics, we cannot know where a particle is and where it's going with absolute precision.
142000	145000	This fact is so important that it has a name.
145000	150000	The Heisenberg uncertainty principle, the basis of all quantum physics.
150000	153000	So what does a particle look like then?
153000	155000	What is its nature?
155000	157000	We don't know.
157000	163000	If we look really hard, we can see a blurry sphere of influence, but not the particles themselves.
163000	166000	We just know they exist.
166000	170000	But if that's the case, how can we do any science with them?
170000	175000	We did what humans do and invented a new story, a mathematical fiction.
175000	178000	The story of the point particle.
178000	182000	We decided that we would pretend that a particle is a point in space.
182000	189000	Any electron is a point with a certain electric charge and a certain mass, all indistinguishable from each other.
189000	194000	This way, physicists could define them and calculate all of their interactions.
194000	199000	This can be made precise in quantum field theory, and this solved a lot of problems.
199000	205000	All of the standard model of particle physics is built on it, and it predicts lots of things very well.
205000	216000	Some quantum properties of the electron, for example, have been tested and are accurate up to 0.000002%.
216000	223000	So while particles are not really points, by treating them as if they were, we get a pretty good picture of the universe.
223000	230000	Not only did this idea advance science, it also led to a lot of real-world technology we use every day.
230000	233000	But there's a huge problem, gravity.
233000	238000	In quantum mechanics, all physical forces are carried by certain particles.
238000	245000	But according to Einstein's general relativity, gravity is not a force like the others in the universe.
245000	251000	If the universe is a play, particles are the actors, but gravity is the stage.
251000	257000	To put it simply, gravity is a theory of geometry, the geometry of space-time itself,
257000	261000	of distances which we need to describe with absolute precision.
261000	265000	But since there is no way to precisely measure things in the quantum world,
265000	269000	our story of gravity doesn't work with our story of quantum physics.
269000	276000	When physicists tried to add gravity to the story by inventing a new particle, their mathematics broke down.
276000	278000	And this is a big problem.
279000	285000	If we could marry gravity to quantum physics and the standard model, we would have the theory of everything.
285000	288000	So very smart people came up with a new story.
288000	294000	They asked, what is more complex than a point, a line, or a string?
294000	296000	String theory was born.
296000	304000	What makes string theory so elegant is that it describes many different elementary particles as different modes of vibration of the string.
305000	311000	Just like a violin string vibrating differently can give you a lot of different notes, a string can give you different particles.
311000	314000	Most importantly, this includes gravity.
316000	320000	String theory promised to unify all fundamental forces of the universe.
320000	323000	This caused enormous excitement and hype.
323000	327000	String theory quickly graduated to a possible theory of everything.
327000	332000	Unfortunately, string theory comes with a lot of strings attached.
333000	341000	Much of the maths involving a consistent string theory does not work in our universe with its three spatial and one temporal dimensions.
341000	344000	String theory requires ten dimensions to work out.
344000	348000	So string theorists did calculations in model universes.
348000	353000	And then tried to get rid of the six additional dimensions and describe our own universe.
353000	359000	But so far, nobody has succeeded and no prediction of string theory has been proven in an experiment.
359000	363000	So string theory did not reveal the nature of our universe.
363000	368000	One could argue that in this case, string theory really isn't useful at all.
368000	371000	Science is all about experiments and predictions.
371000	375000	If we can't do those, why should we bother with strings?
375000	378000	It really is all about how we use it.
378000	380000	Physics is based on maths.
380000	382000	Two plus two makes four.
382000	385000	This is true no matter how you feel about it.
385000	388000	And the maths in string theory does work out.
388000	391000	That's why string theory is still useful.
391000	396000	Imagine that you want to build a cruise ship, but you only have blueprints for a small rowing boat.
396000	398000	There are plenty of differences.
398000	401000	The engine, the materials, the scale.
401000	404000	But both things are fundamentally the same.
404000	406000	Things that float.
407000	413000	So by studying the rowing boat blueprints, you might still learn something about how to build a cruise ship eventually.
414000	420000	With string theory, we can try to answer some questions about quantum gravity that have been puzzling physicists for decades,
420000	424000	such as how black holes work or the information paradox.
424000	427000	String theory may point us in the right direction.
427000	432000	When used in this spirit, string theory becomes a precious tool for theoretical physicists
432000	437000	and help them discover new aspects of the quantum world and some beautiful mathematics.
437000	442000	So maybe the story of string theory is not the theory of everything.
442000	447000	But just like the story of the point particle, it may be an extremely useful story.
447000	450000	We don't yet know what the true nature of reality is,
450000	457000	but we'll keep coming up with stories to try and find out until one day, hopefully, we do know.
