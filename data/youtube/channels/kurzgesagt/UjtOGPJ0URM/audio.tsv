0	4000	Imagine NASA announced today that they found aliens.
4000	9000	Bacteria on Mars, weird alien fish in the oceans of Europa,
9000	14000	and also ancient alien ruins on Titan. Wouldn't that be great?
14000	19000	Well, no, it would be horrible news. Devastating even.
19000	25000	It could mean that the end of humanity is almost certain and that it might be coming soon.
25000	30000	Why? Why would the most exciting discovery of our lifetime be bad?
40000	46000	Let us imagine the development of life from its inception to us today as a flight of stairs.
46000	51000	The first step is dead chemistry that needs to assemble itself into self-replicating patterns,
51000	55000	stable and resilient, but also able to change and evolve.
55000	59000	The second step is for our early life to become more complex,
59000	65000	able to build more complicated structures and use the available energy much more efficiently.
65000	70000	On the next step, these cells combine to become multicellular beings,
70000	73000	enabling unbelievable variety and further complexity.
73000	77000	The step above sees the species evolve big brains,
77000	83000	enabling the use of tools, culture and shared knowledge, which creates even higher complexity.
83000	89000	The species can now become the dominant lifeform on its planet and change it according to its needs.
89000	95000	First, shy attempts to leave its planet are happening. This is where we are now.
95000	100000	It's in the nature of life as we know it to reach out, to cover every niche it can.
100000	104000	And since planets have a limited carrying capacity and lifespan,
104000	109000	if a species wants to survive, it will look for more places to spread to.
109000	112000	So the steps above the current ones seem logical.
112000	117000	Colonize your own solar system, then spread further to reach other stars,
117000	122000	to the possible final step, becoming a galaxy-wide civilization.
122000	128000	It's very likely that this is a universal principle for civilizations no matter where they're from.
128000	133000	If a species is competitive and driven enough to take control over its planet,
133000	135000	they'll probably not stop there.
135000	140000	We know that there are up to 500 billion planets in the Milky Way,
140000	143000	at least 10 billion Earth-like planets.
143000	146000	Many have been around billions of years longer than Earth.
146000	150000	But we're observing zero galactic civilizations.
150000	154000	We should be able to see something. But there's nothing.
154000	157000	Space seems to be empty and dead.
157000	162000	This means something is preventing living things from climbing the staircase
162000	165000	beyond the step we're on right now.
165000	173000	Something that makes becoming a galactic civilization extremely hard may be impossible.
173000	178000	This is the Great Filter, a challenge or danger so hard to overcome
178000	182000	that it eliminates almost every species that encounters it.
183000	188000	There are two scenarios. One means we are incredibly special and lucky.
188000	193000	The other one means we are doomed and practically already dead.
193000	197000	It depends on where the filter is on our staircase.
197000	200000	Behind or ahead of us?
200000	205000	Scenario 1. The filter is behind us. We are the first.
205000	211000	If the filter is behind us, that means that one of the steps we passed is almost impossible to take.
211000	216000	Which step could it be? Is life itself extremely rare?
216000	221000	It's very hard to make predictions about how likely it is for life to emerge from dead things.
221000	223000	There is no consensus.
223000	227000	Some scientists think it develops everywhere where the conditions are right.
227000	232000	Others think that Earth might be the only living place in the universe.
232000	236000	Another candidate is the step of complex animal cells.
236000	243000	A very specific thing happened on this step, and as far as we know, it happened exactly once.
243000	249000	A primitive hunter cell swallowed another cell, but instead of devouring it, the two cells formed a union.
249000	255000	The bigger cell provided shelter, took care of interacting with the environment and providing resources,
255000	262000	while the smaller one used its new home and free stuff to focus on providing a lot of extra energy for its host.
262000	270000	With the abundant energy, the host cell could grow more than before and build new and expensive things to improve itself,
270000	273000	while the guest became the powerhouse of the cell.
273000	277000	These cells make up every animal on the planet.
277000	281000	Maybe there are billions of bacteria-covered planets in the Milky Way,
281000	286000	but not a single one apart from us has achieved our level of complexity.
286000	292000	Or intelligence. We humans feel very smart and sophisticated with our crossword puzzles and romantic novels,
292000	297000	but a big brain is, first and foremost, a very expensive evolutionary investment.
297000	303000	They are fragile. They don't help in a fistfight with a bear. They cost enormous amounts of energy.
303000	310000	And despite them, it took modern humans 200,000 years to get from sharp sticks to civilization.
310000	313000	Being smart does not mean you get to win automatically.
313000	318000	Maybe intelligence is just not so great, and we're lucky that it worked out for us.
318000	322000	Scenario 2. The filter is ahead of us.
322000	325000	Plenty of others died already.
325000	331000	A great filter before us is orders of magnitude more dangerous than anything we encountered so far.
331000	338000	Even if a major disaster killed most of us or threw us back thousands of years, we would survive and recover.
338000	343000	And if we can recover, even if it takes a million years, then it's not a great filter,
343000	347000	but just a roadblock to an eventual galactic civilization.
347000	352000	On universal timescales, even millions of years are just the blink of an eye.
352000	359000	If a great filter really lies before us, it has to be so dangerous, so purely devastating and powerful,
359000	366000	that it has destroyed most, if not all, advanced civilizations in our galaxy over billions of years.
366000	372000	A really daunting and depressing hypothesis is that once a species takes control over its planet,
372000	376000	it's already on the path to self-destruction.
376000	379000	Technology is a good way to achieve that.
379000	384000	It needs to be something that's so obvious that virtually everybody discovers it,
384000	390000	and so dangerous that its discovery leads almost universally to an existential disaster.
390000	393000	A large-scale nuclear war.
393000	396000	Nanotechnology that gets out of control.
396000	399000	Genetic engineering of the perfect superbug.
399000	402000	An experiment that lights the whole atmosphere on fire.
402000	409000	It might be a super-intelligent AI that accidentally or purposely destroys its creators.
409000	413000	Or things that we can't even see coming right now.
413000	415000	Or it's way simpler.
415000	422000	A species competitive enough to take over their planet, necessarily destroy it while competing with each other for resources.
422000	429000	Maybe there are runaway chain reactions in every ecosystem that once set in motion are not fixable.
429000	434000	And so once a civilization is powerful enough to change the composition of its atmosphere,
434000	438000	they make their planet uninhabitable 100% of the time.
438000	440000	Let's hope that that's not the case.
440000	444000	If the filter is ahead of us, our odds are really bad.
445000	447000	What we can hope for.
447000	451000	This is why finding life beyond Earth would be horrible.
451000	456000	The more common life is in the universe, and the more advanced and complex it is,
456000	459000	the more likely it becomes that a filter is in front of us.
459000	465000	Bacteria would be bad, small animals would be worse, intelligent life would be alarming.
465000	470000	Ruins of ancient alien civilizations would be horrible.
470000	475000	The best case scenario for us right now is that Mars is sterile.
475000	484000	That Europa's oceans are devoid of life, and the vast arms of the Milky Way harbor only empty oceans hugging dead continents.
484000	490000	That there are billions of empty planets waiting to be discovered and to be filled up with life.
490000	496000	Billions of new homes, waiting for us to finally arrive.
497000	503000	How likely is it that we'll find life outside of Earth that is similar to us?
503000	509000	Well, that depends on how many planets there are out there in their star's Goldilocks zone,
509000	512000	the area around a star where water can be liquid.
512000	518000	Because stars come in all sizes and configurations, this zone is different for every star system
518000	521000	and requires a little bit of physics to figure out.
521000	529000	If that sounds like fun to you, this quiz from Brilliant helps to break down the maths for exactly how this is calculated.
529000	536000	Brilliant is a problem-solving website that teaches you to think like a scientist by guiding you through problems.
536000	542000	They take concepts like these, break them up into bite-sized bits, present clear thinking in each part,
542000	545000	and then build back up to an interesting conclusion.
