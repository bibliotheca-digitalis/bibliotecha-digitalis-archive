00:00.000 --> 00:04.000
Imagine NASA announced today that they found aliens.

00:04.000 --> 00:09.000
Bacteria on Mars, weird alien fish in the oceans of Europa,

00:09.000 --> 00:14.000
and also ancient alien ruins on Titan. Wouldn't that be great?

00:14.000 --> 00:19.000
Well, no, it would be horrible news. Devastating even.

00:19.000 --> 00:25.000
It could mean that the end of humanity is almost certain and that it might be coming soon.

00:25.000 --> 00:30.000
Why? Why would the most exciting discovery of our lifetime be bad?

00:40.000 --> 00:46.000
Let us imagine the development of life from its inception to us today as a flight of stairs.

00:46.000 --> 00:51.000
The first step is dead chemistry that needs to assemble itself into self-replicating patterns,

00:51.000 --> 00:55.000
stable and resilient, but also able to change and evolve.

00:55.000 --> 00:59.000
The second step is for our early life to become more complex,

00:59.000 --> 01:05.000
able to build more complicated structures and use the available energy much more efficiently.

01:05.000 --> 01:10.000
On the next step, these cells combine to become multicellular beings,

01:10.000 --> 01:13.000
enabling unbelievable variety and further complexity.

01:13.000 --> 01:17.000
The step above sees the species evolve big brains,

01:17.000 --> 01:23.000
enabling the use of tools, culture and shared knowledge, which creates even higher complexity.

01:23.000 --> 01:29.000
The species can now become the dominant lifeform on its planet and change it according to its needs.

01:29.000 --> 01:35.000
First, shy attempts to leave its planet are happening. This is where we are now.

01:35.000 --> 01:40.000
It's in the nature of life as we know it to reach out, to cover every niche it can.

01:40.000 --> 01:44.000
And since planets have a limited carrying capacity and lifespan,

01:44.000 --> 01:49.000
if a species wants to survive, it will look for more places to spread to.

01:49.000 --> 01:52.000
So the steps above the current ones seem logical.

01:52.000 --> 01:57.000
Colonize your own solar system, then spread further to reach other stars,

01:57.000 --> 02:02.000
to the possible final step, becoming a galaxy-wide civilization.

02:02.000 --> 02:08.000
It's very likely that this is a universal principle for civilizations no matter where they're from.

02:08.000 --> 02:13.000
If a species is competitive and driven enough to take control over its planet,

02:13.000 --> 02:15.000
they'll probably not stop there.

02:15.000 --> 02:20.000
We know that there are up to 500 billion planets in the Milky Way,

02:20.000 --> 02:23.000
at least 10 billion Earth-like planets.

02:23.000 --> 02:26.000
Many have been around billions of years longer than Earth.

02:26.000 --> 02:30.000
But we're observing zero galactic civilizations.

02:30.000 --> 02:34.000
We should be able to see something. But there's nothing.

02:34.000 --> 02:37.000
Space seems to be empty and dead.

02:37.000 --> 02:42.000
This means something is preventing living things from climbing the staircase

02:42.000 --> 02:45.000
beyond the step we're on right now.

02:45.000 --> 02:53.000
Something that makes becoming a galactic civilization extremely hard may be impossible.

02:53.000 --> 02:58.000
This is the Great Filter, a challenge or danger so hard to overcome

02:58.000 --> 03:02.000
that it eliminates almost every species that encounters it.

03:03.000 --> 03:08.000
There are two scenarios. One means we are incredibly special and lucky.

03:08.000 --> 03:13.000
The other one means we are doomed and practically already dead.

03:13.000 --> 03:17.000
It depends on where the filter is on our staircase.

03:17.000 --> 03:20.000
Behind or ahead of us?

03:20.000 --> 03:25.000
Scenario 1. The filter is behind us. We are the first.

03:25.000 --> 03:31.000
If the filter is behind us, that means that one of the steps we passed is almost impossible to take.

03:31.000 --> 03:36.000
Which step could it be? Is life itself extremely rare?

03:36.000 --> 03:41.000
It's very hard to make predictions about how likely it is for life to emerge from dead things.

03:41.000 --> 03:43.000
There is no consensus.

03:43.000 --> 03:47.000
Some scientists think it develops everywhere where the conditions are right.

03:47.000 --> 03:52.000
Others think that Earth might be the only living place in the universe.

03:52.000 --> 03:56.000
Another candidate is the step of complex animal cells.

03:56.000 --> 04:03.000
A very specific thing happened on this step, and as far as we know, it happened exactly once.

04:03.000 --> 04:09.000
A primitive hunter cell swallowed another cell, but instead of devouring it, the two cells formed a union.

04:09.000 --> 04:15.000
The bigger cell provided shelter, took care of interacting with the environment and providing resources,

04:15.000 --> 04:22.000
while the smaller one used its new home and free stuff to focus on providing a lot of extra energy for its host.

04:22.000 --> 04:30.000
With the abundant energy, the host cell could grow more than before and build new and expensive things to improve itself,

04:30.000 --> 04:33.000
while the guest became the powerhouse of the cell.

04:33.000 --> 04:37.000
These cells make up every animal on the planet.

04:37.000 --> 04:41.000
Maybe there are billions of bacteria-covered planets in the Milky Way,

04:41.000 --> 04:46.000
but not a single one apart from us has achieved our level of complexity.

04:46.000 --> 04:52.000
Or intelligence. We humans feel very smart and sophisticated with our crossword puzzles and romantic novels,

04:52.000 --> 04:57.000
but a big brain is, first and foremost, a very expensive evolutionary investment.

04:57.000 --> 05:03.000
They are fragile. They don't help in a fistfight with a bear. They cost enormous amounts of energy.

05:03.000 --> 05:10.000
And despite them, it took modern humans 200,000 years to get from sharp sticks to civilization.

05:10.000 --> 05:13.000
Being smart does not mean you get to win automatically.

05:13.000 --> 05:18.000
Maybe intelligence is just not so great, and we're lucky that it worked out for us.

05:18.000 --> 05:22.000
Scenario 2. The filter is ahead of us.

05:22.000 --> 05:25.000
Plenty of others died already.

05:25.000 --> 05:31.000
A great filter before us is orders of magnitude more dangerous than anything we encountered so far.

05:31.000 --> 05:38.000
Even if a major disaster killed most of us or threw us back thousands of years, we would survive and recover.

05:38.000 --> 05:43.000
And if we can recover, even if it takes a million years, then it's not a great filter,

05:43.000 --> 05:47.000
but just a roadblock to an eventual galactic civilization.

05:47.000 --> 05:52.000
On universal timescales, even millions of years are just the blink of an eye.

05:52.000 --> 05:59.000
If a great filter really lies before us, it has to be so dangerous, so purely devastating and powerful,

05:59.000 --> 06:06.000
that it has destroyed most, if not all, advanced civilizations in our galaxy over billions of years.

06:06.000 --> 06:12.000
A really daunting and depressing hypothesis is that once a species takes control over its planet,

06:12.000 --> 06:16.000
it's already on the path to self-destruction.

06:16.000 --> 06:19.000
Technology is a good way to achieve that.

06:19.000 --> 06:24.000
It needs to be something that's so obvious that virtually everybody discovers it,

06:24.000 --> 06:30.000
and so dangerous that its discovery leads almost universally to an existential disaster.

06:30.000 --> 06:33.000
A large-scale nuclear war.

06:33.000 --> 06:36.000
Nanotechnology that gets out of control.

06:36.000 --> 06:39.000
Genetic engineering of the perfect superbug.

06:39.000 --> 06:42.000
An experiment that lights the whole atmosphere on fire.

06:42.000 --> 06:49.000
It might be a super-intelligent AI that accidentally or purposely destroys its creators.

06:49.000 --> 06:53.000
Or things that we can't even see coming right now.

06:53.000 --> 06:55.000
Or it's way simpler.

06:55.000 --> 07:02.000
A species competitive enough to take over their planet, necessarily destroy it while competing with each other for resources.

07:02.000 --> 07:09.000
Maybe there are runaway chain reactions in every ecosystem that once set in motion are not fixable.

07:09.000 --> 07:14.000
And so once a civilization is powerful enough to change the composition of its atmosphere,

07:14.000 --> 07:18.000
they make their planet uninhabitable 100% of the time.

07:18.000 --> 07:20.000
Let's hope that that's not the case.

07:20.000 --> 07:24.000
If the filter is ahead of us, our odds are really bad.

07:25.000 --> 07:27.000
What we can hope for.

07:27.000 --> 07:31.000
This is why finding life beyond Earth would be horrible.

07:31.000 --> 07:36.000
The more common life is in the universe, and the more advanced and complex it is,

07:36.000 --> 07:39.000
the more likely it becomes that a filter is in front of us.

07:39.000 --> 07:45.000
Bacteria would be bad, small animals would be worse, intelligent life would be alarming.

07:45.000 --> 07:50.000
Ruins of ancient alien civilizations would be horrible.

07:50.000 --> 07:55.000
The best case scenario for us right now is that Mars is sterile.

07:55.000 --> 08:04.000
That Europa's oceans are devoid of life, and the vast arms of the Milky Way harbor only empty oceans hugging dead continents.

08:04.000 --> 08:10.000
That there are billions of empty planets waiting to be discovered and to be filled up with life.

08:10.000 --> 08:16.000
Billions of new homes, waiting for us to finally arrive.

08:17.000 --> 08:23.000
How likely is it that we'll find life outside of Earth that is similar to us?

08:23.000 --> 08:29.000
Well, that depends on how many planets there are out there in their star's Goldilocks zone,

08:29.000 --> 08:32.000
the area around a star where water can be liquid.

08:32.000 --> 08:38.000
Because stars come in all sizes and configurations, this zone is different for every star system

08:38.000 --> 08:41.000
and requires a little bit of physics to figure out.

08:41.000 --> 08:49.000
If that sounds like fun to you, this quiz from Brilliant helps to break down the maths for exactly how this is calculated.

08:49.000 --> 08:56.000

08:56.000 --> 09:02.000
They take concepts like these, break them up into bite-sized bits, present clear thinking in each part,

09:02.000 --> 09:05.000
and then build back up to an interesting conclusion.

09:05.000 --> 09:14.000
