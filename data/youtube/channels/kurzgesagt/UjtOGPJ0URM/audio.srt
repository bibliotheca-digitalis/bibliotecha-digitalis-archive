1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
Imagine NASA announced today that they found aliens.

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:09,000
Bacteria on Mars, weird alien fish in the oceans of Europa,

3
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:14,000
and also ancient alien ruins on Titan. Wouldn't that be great?

4
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:19,000
Well, no, it would be horrible news. Devastating even.

5
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:25,000
It could mean that the end of humanity is almost certain and that it might be coming soon.

6
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:30,000
Why? Why would the most exciting discovery of our lifetime be bad?

7
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:46,000
Let us imagine the development of life from its inception to us today as a flight of stairs.

8
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:51,000
The first step is dead chemistry that needs to assemble itself into self-replicating patterns,

9
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:55,000
stable and resilient, but also able to change and evolve.

10
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:59,000
The second step is for our early life to become more complex,

11
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:05,000
able to build more complicated structures and use the available energy much more efficiently.

12
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:10,000
On the next step, these cells combine to become multicellular beings,

13
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:13,000
enabling unbelievable variety and further complexity.

14
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:17,000
The step above sees the species evolve big brains,

15
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:23,000
enabling the use of tools, culture and shared knowledge, which creates even higher complexity.

16
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:29,000
The species can now become the dominant lifeform on its planet and change it according to its needs.

17
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:35,000
First, shy attempts to leave its planet are happening. This is where we are now.

18
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:40,000
It's in the nature of life as we know it to reach out, to cover every niche it can.

19
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:44,000
And since planets have a limited carrying capacity and lifespan,

20
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:49,000
if a species wants to survive, it will look for more places to spread to.

21
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:52,000
So the steps above the current ones seem logical.

22
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:57,000
Colonize your own solar system, then spread further to reach other stars,

23
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:02,000
to the possible final step, becoming a galaxy-wide civilization.

24
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:08,000
It's very likely that this is a universal principle for civilizations no matter where they're from.

25
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:13,000
If a species is competitive and driven enough to take control over its planet,

26
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:15,000
they'll probably not stop there.

27
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:20,000
We know that there are up to 500 billion planets in the Milky Way,

28
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:23,000
at least 10 billion Earth-like planets.

29
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:26,000
Many have been around billions of years longer than Earth.

30
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:30,000
But we're observing zero galactic civilizations.

31
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:34,000
We should be able to see something. But there's nothing.

32
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:37,000
Space seems to be empty and dead.

33
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:42,000
This means something is preventing living things from climbing the staircase

34
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:45,000
beyond the step we're on right now.

35
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:53,000
Something that makes becoming a galactic civilization extremely hard may be impossible.

36
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:58,000
This is the Great Filter, a challenge or danger so hard to overcome

37
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:02,000
that it eliminates almost every species that encounters it.

38
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:08,000
There are two scenarios. One means we are incredibly special and lucky.

39
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:13,000
The other one means we are doomed and practically already dead.

40
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:17,000
It depends on where the filter is on our staircase.

41
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:20,000
Behind or ahead of us?

42
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:25,000
Scenario 1. The filter is behind us. We are the first.

43
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:31,000
If the filter is behind us, that means that one of the steps we passed is almost impossible to take.

44
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:36,000
Which step could it be? Is life itself extremely rare?

45
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:41,000
It's very hard to make predictions about how likely it is for life to emerge from dead things.

46
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:43,000
There is no consensus.

47
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:47,000
Some scientists think it develops everywhere where the conditions are right.

48
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:52,000
Others think that Earth might be the only living place in the universe.

49
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:56,000
Another candidate is the step of complex animal cells.

50
00:03:56,000 --> 00:04:03,000
A very specific thing happened on this step, and as far as we know, it happened exactly once.

51
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:09,000
A primitive hunter cell swallowed another cell, but instead of devouring it, the two cells formed a union.

52
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:15,000
The bigger cell provided shelter, took care of interacting with the environment and providing resources,

53
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:22,000
while the smaller one used its new home and free stuff to focus on providing a lot of extra energy for its host.

54
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:30,000
With the abundant energy, the host cell could grow more than before and build new and expensive things to improve itself,

55
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:33,000
while the guest became the powerhouse of the cell.

56
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:37,000
These cells make up every animal on the planet.

57
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:41,000
Maybe there are billions of bacteria-covered planets in the Milky Way,

58
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:46,000
but not a single one apart from us has achieved our level of complexity.

59
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:52,000
Or intelligence. We humans feel very smart and sophisticated with our crossword puzzles and romantic novels,

60
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:57,000
but a big brain is, first and foremost, a very expensive evolutionary investment.

61
00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:03,000
They are fragile. They don't help in a fistfight with a bear. They cost enormous amounts of energy.

62
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:10,000
And despite them, it took modern humans 200,000 years to get from sharp sticks to civilization.

63
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:13,000
Being smart does not mean you get to win automatically.

64
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:18,000
Maybe intelligence is just not so great, and we're lucky that it worked out for us.

65
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:22,000
Scenario 2. The filter is ahead of us.

66
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:25,000
Plenty of others died already.

67
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:31,000
A great filter before us is orders of magnitude more dangerous than anything we encountered so far.

68
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:38,000
Even if a major disaster killed most of us or threw us back thousands of years, we would survive and recover.

69
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:43,000
And if we can recover, even if it takes a million years, then it's not a great filter,

70
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:47,000
but just a roadblock to an eventual galactic civilization.

71
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:52,000
On universal timescales, even millions of years are just the blink of an eye.

72
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:59,000
If a great filter really lies before us, it has to be so dangerous, so purely devastating and powerful,

73
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:06,000
that it has destroyed most, if not all, advanced civilizations in our galaxy over billions of years.

74
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:12,000
A really daunting and depressing hypothesis is that once a species takes control over its planet,

75
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:16,000
it's already on the path to self-destruction.

76
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:19,000
Technology is a good way to achieve that.

77
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:24,000
It needs to be something that's so obvious that virtually everybody discovers it,

78
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:30,000
and so dangerous that its discovery leads almost universally to an existential disaster.

79
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:33,000
A large-scale nuclear war.

80
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:36,000
Nanotechnology that gets out of control.

81
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:39,000
Genetic engineering of the perfect superbug.

82
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:42,000
An experiment that lights the whole atmosphere on fire.

83
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:49,000
It might be a super-intelligent AI that accidentally or purposely destroys its creators.

84
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:53,000
Or things that we can't even see coming right now.

85
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:55,000
Or it's way simpler.

86
00:06:55,000 --> 00:07:02,000
A species competitive enough to take over their planet, necessarily destroy it while competing with each other for resources.

87
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:09,000
Maybe there are runaway chain reactions in every ecosystem that once set in motion are not fixable.

88
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:14,000
And so once a civilization is powerful enough to change the composition of its atmosphere,

89
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:18,000
they make their planet uninhabitable 100% of the time.

90
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:20,000
Let's hope that that's not the case.

91
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:24,000
If the filter is ahead of us, our odds are really bad.

92
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:27,000
What we can hope for.

93
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:31,000
This is why finding life beyond Earth would be horrible.

94
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:36,000
The more common life is in the universe, and the more advanced and complex it is,

95
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:39,000
the more likely it becomes that a filter is in front of us.

96
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:45,000
Bacteria would be bad, small animals would be worse, intelligent life would be alarming.

97
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:50,000
Ruins of ancient alien civilizations would be horrible.

98
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:55,000
The best case scenario for us right now is that Mars is sterile.

99
00:07:55,000 --> 00:08:04,000
That Europa's oceans are devoid of life, and the vast arms of the Milky Way harbor only empty oceans hugging dead continents.

100
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:10,000
That there are billions of empty planets waiting to be discovered and to be filled up with life.

101
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:16,000
Billions of new homes, waiting for us to finally arrive.

102
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:23,000
How likely is it that we'll find life outside of Earth that is similar to us?

103
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:29,000
Well, that depends on how many planets there are out there in their star's Goldilocks zone,

104
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:32,000
the area around a star where water can be liquid.

105
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:38,000
Because stars come in all sizes and configurations, this zone is different for every star system

106
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:41,000
and requires a little bit of physics to figure out.

107
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:49,000
If that sounds like fun to you, this quiz from Brilliant helps to break down the maths for exactly how this is calculated.

108
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:56,000
Brilliant is a problem-solving website that teaches you to think like a scientist by guiding you through problems.

109
00:08:56,000 --> 00:09:02,000
They take concepts like these, break them up into bite-sized bits, present clear thinking in each part,

110
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:05,000
and then build back up to an interesting conclusion.
