0	4500	The fundamental currency of our universe is energy.
4500	7980	It lights our homes, grows our food,
7980	12340	powers our computers. We can get it lots of ways,
12340	17260	burning fossil fuels, splitting atoms, or sunlight striking photovoltaics.
17260	20820	But there's a downside to everything. Fossil fuels
20820	24860	are extremely toxic, nuclear waste is, well, nuclear waste,
24860	28780	and there are not enough batteries to store sunlight for cloudy days yet.
29560	33620	And yet, the Sun seems to have virtually limitless free energy.
33620	36780	Is there a way we could build a Sun on Earth?
36780	38780	Can we bottle a star?
48780	51580	The Sun shines because of nuclear fusion.
51580	55100	In a nutshell, fusion is a thermonuclear process,
55100	58560	meaning that the ingredients have to be incredibly hot, so hot
58560	62080	that the atoms are stripped of their electrons, making a plasma
62080	65080	where nuclei and electrons bounce around freely.
65080	68320	Since nuclei are all positively charged,
68320	71780	they repel each other. In order to overcome this repulsion,
71780	75920	the particles have to be going very, very fast. In this context,
75920	80000	very fast means very hot, millions of degrees.
80000	83080	Stars cheat to reach these temperatures.
83080	86160	They are so massive that the pressure in their cores
86160	89760	generates the heat to squeeze the nuclei together until they merge
89760	93000	and fuse, creating heavier nuclei and releasing
93000	96760	energy in the process. It is this energy release
96760	100760	that scientists hope to harness in a new generation of power plant,
100760	105480	the fusion reactor. On Earth, it's not feasible to use this
105480	109680	brute force method to create fusion, so if we wanted to build a reactor that
109680	111360	generates energy from fusion,
111360	116120	we have to get clever. To date, scientists have invented two ways of
116160	118160	making plasmas hot enough to fuse.
118160	122760	The first type of reactor uses a magnetic field to squeeze a plasma in a
122760	123960	donut-shaped chamber
123960	128720	where the reactions take place. These magnetic confinement reactors,
128720	131760	such as the ITER reactor in France, use
131760	134840	superconducting electromagnets cooled with liquid helium
134840	138400	to within a few degrees of absolute zero, meaning they host
138400	141400	some of the biggest temperature gradients in the known universe.
141400	144600	The second type, called inertial confinement,
144680	149000	uses pulses from super-powered lasers to heat the surface of a pellet of fuel,
149000	152800	imploding it, briefly making the fuel hot and dense enough to fuse.
152800	156440	In fact, one of the most powerful lasers in the world
156440	160080	is used for fusion experiments at the National Ignition Facility
160080	164440	in the US. These experiments and others like them around the world
164440	169240	are today just experiments. Scientists are still developing the technology.
169240	172480	And although they can achieve fusion,
172560	175880	right now, it costs more energy to do the experiment
175880	180320	than they produce in fusion. The technology has a long way to go before
180320	181880	it's commercially viable.
181880	185540	And maybe it never will be. It might just be
185540	188680	impossible to make a viable fusion reactor on earth.
188680	191960	But if it gets there, it will be so efficient
191960	195320	that a single glass of seawater could be used to produce
195320	199560	as much energy as burning a barrel of oil with no waste to speak of.
200360	204160	This is because fusion reactors would use hydrogen or helium as fuel,
204160	208040	and seawater is loaded with hydrogen. But not just
208040	211800	any hydrogen will do. Specific isotopes with extra neutrons
211800	216200	called deuterium and tritium are needed to make the right reactions.
216200	220480	Deuterium is stable and can be found in abundance in seawater,
220480	224320	though tritium is a bit trickier. It's radioactive,
224320	227440	and there may only be 20 kilograms of it in the world,
227520	231200	mostly in nuclear warheads, which makes it incredibly expensive.
231200	234480	So we may need another fusion buddy for deuterium
234480	238640	instead of tritium. Helium-3, an isotope of helium,
238640	241640	might be a great substitute. Unfortunately,
241640	245240	it's also incredibly rare on earth. But here,
245240	250120	the moon might have the answer. Over billions of years,
250120	254240	the solar wind may have built up huge deposits of helium-3 on the moon.
255120	257920	Instead of making helium-3, we can mine it.
257920	261280	If we could sift the lunar dust for helium,
261280	265000	we'd have enough fuel to power the entire world for thousands of years.
265000	269760	One more argument for establishing a moon base if you weren't convinced already.
269760	273720	Okay, maybe you think building a mini sun
273720	279160	still sounds kind of dangerous. But they'd actually be much safer than most
279160	280600	other types of power plant.
281600	285080	A fusion reactor is not like a nuclear plant,
285080	289080	which can melt down catastrophically. If the confinement failed,
289080	292640	then the plasma would expand and cool, and the reaction would stop.
292640	295720	Put simply, it's not a bomb.
295720	299800	The release of radioactive fuel like tritium
299800	304040	could pose a threat to the environment. Tritium could bond with oxygen-making
304040	305200	radioactive water,
305200	309760	which could be dangerous as it seeps into the environment. Fortunately,
309800	313360	there's no more than a few grams of tritium in use at a given time,
313360	318280	so a leak would be quickly diluted. So we've just told you that there's nearly
318280	321680	unlimited energy to be had at no expense to the environment
321680	325640	in something as simple as water. So, what's the catch?
325640	330720	Cost. We simply don't know if fusion power will ever be commercially viable.
330720	334600	Even if they work, they might be too expensive to ever build.
334600	338040	The main drawback is that it's unproven technology.
338480	343120	It's a 10 billion dollar gamble, and that money might be better spent on other
343120	343920	clean energy
343920	348320	that's already proven itself. Maybe we should cut our losses.
348320	352520	Or maybe, when the payoff is unlimited clean energy for
352520	356840	everyone, it might be worth the risk.
