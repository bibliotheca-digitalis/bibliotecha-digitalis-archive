1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,500
The fundamental currency of our universe is energy.

2
00:00:04,500 --> 00:00:07,980
It lights our homes, grows our food,

3
00:00:07,980 --> 00:00:12,340
powers our computers. We can get it lots of ways,

4
00:00:12,340 --> 00:00:17,260
burning fossil fuels, splitting atoms, or sunlight striking photovoltaics.

5
00:00:17,260 --> 00:00:20,820
But there's a downside to everything. Fossil fuels

6
00:00:20,820 --> 00:00:24,860
are extremely toxic, nuclear waste is, well, nuclear waste,

7
00:00:24,860 --> 00:00:28,780
and there are not enough batteries to store sunlight for cloudy days yet.

8
00:00:29,560 --> 00:00:33,620
And yet, the Sun seems to have virtually limitless free energy.

9
00:00:33,620 --> 00:00:36,780
Is there a way we could build a Sun on Earth?

10
00:00:36,780 --> 00:00:38,780
Can we bottle a star?

11
00:00:48,780 --> 00:00:51,580
The Sun shines because of nuclear fusion.

12
00:00:51,580 --> 00:00:55,100
In a nutshell, fusion is a thermonuclear process,

13
00:00:55,100 --> 00:00:58,560
meaning that the ingredients have to be incredibly hot, so hot

14
00:00:58,560 --> 00:01:02,080
that the atoms are stripped of their electrons, making a plasma

15
00:01:02,080 --> 00:01:05,080
where nuclei and electrons bounce around freely.

16
00:01:05,080 --> 00:01:08,320
Since nuclei are all positively charged,

17
00:01:08,320 --> 00:01:11,780
they repel each other. In order to overcome this repulsion,

18
00:01:11,780 --> 00:01:15,920
the particles have to be going very, very fast. In this context,

19
00:01:15,920 --> 00:01:20,000
very fast means very hot, millions of degrees.

20
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:23,080
Stars cheat to reach these temperatures.

21
00:01:23,080 --> 00:01:26,160
They are so massive that the pressure in their cores

22
00:01:26,160 --> 00:01:29,760
generates the heat to squeeze the nuclei together until they merge

23
00:01:29,760 --> 00:01:33,000
and fuse, creating heavier nuclei and releasing

24
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:36,760
energy in the process. It is this energy release

25
00:01:36,760 --> 00:01:40,760
that scientists hope to harness in a new generation of power plant,

26
00:01:40,760 --> 00:01:45,480
the fusion reactor. On Earth, it's not feasible to use this

27
00:01:45,480 --> 00:01:49,680
brute force method to create fusion, so if we wanted to build a reactor that

28
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:51,360
generates energy from fusion,

29
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:56,120
we have to get clever. To date, scientists have invented two ways of

30
00:01:56,160 --> 00:01:58,160
making plasmas hot enough to fuse.

31
00:01:58,160 --> 00:02:02,760
The first type of reactor uses a magnetic field to squeeze a plasma in a

32
00:02:02,760 --> 00:02:03,960
donut-shaped chamber

33
00:02:03,960 --> 00:02:08,720
where the reactions take place. These magnetic confinement reactors,

34
00:02:08,720 --> 00:02:11,760
such as the ITER reactor in France, use

35
00:02:11,760 --> 00:02:14,840
superconducting electromagnets cooled with liquid helium

36
00:02:14,840 --> 00:02:18,400
to within a few degrees of absolute zero, meaning they host

37
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:21,400
some of the biggest temperature gradients in the known universe.

38
00:02:21,400 --> 00:02:24,600
The second type, called inertial confinement,

39
00:02:24,680 --> 00:02:29,000
uses pulses from super-powered lasers to heat the surface of a pellet of fuel,

40
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:32,800
imploding it, briefly making the fuel hot and dense enough to fuse.

41
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:36,440
In fact, one of the most powerful lasers in the world

42
00:02:36,440 --> 00:02:40,080
is used for fusion experiments at the National Ignition Facility

43
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:44,440
in the US. These experiments and others like them around the world

44
00:02:44,440 --> 00:02:49,240
are today just experiments. Scientists are still developing the technology.

45
00:02:49,240 --> 00:02:52,480
And although they can achieve fusion,

46
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:55,880
right now, it costs more energy to do the experiment

47
00:02:55,880 --> 00:03:00,320
than they produce in fusion. The technology has a long way to go before

48
00:03:00,320 --> 00:03:01,880
it's commercially viable.

49
00:03:01,880 --> 00:03:05,540
And maybe it never will be. It might just be

50
00:03:05,540 --> 00:03:08,680
impossible to make a viable fusion reactor on earth.

51
00:03:08,680 --> 00:03:11,960
But if it gets there, it will be so efficient

52
00:03:11,960 --> 00:03:15,320
that a single glass of seawater could be used to produce

53
00:03:15,320 --> 00:03:19,560
as much energy as burning a barrel of oil with no waste to speak of.

54
00:03:20,360 --> 00:03:24,160
This is because fusion reactors would use hydrogen or helium as fuel,

55
00:03:24,160 --> 00:03:28,040
and seawater is loaded with hydrogen. But not just

56
00:03:28,040 --> 00:03:31,800
any hydrogen will do. Specific isotopes with extra neutrons

57
00:03:31,800 --> 00:03:36,200
called deuterium and tritium are needed to make the right reactions.

58
00:03:36,200 --> 00:03:40,480
Deuterium is stable and can be found in abundance in seawater,

59
00:03:40,480 --> 00:03:44,320
though tritium is a bit trickier. It's radioactive,

60
00:03:44,320 --> 00:03:47,440
and there may only be 20 kilograms of it in the world,

61
00:03:47,520 --> 00:03:51,200
mostly in nuclear warheads, which makes it incredibly expensive.

62
00:03:51,200 --> 00:03:54,480
So we may need another fusion buddy for deuterium

63
00:03:54,480 --> 00:03:58,640
instead of tritium. Helium-3, an isotope of helium,

64
00:03:58,640 --> 00:04:01,640
might be a great substitute. Unfortunately,

65
00:04:01,640 --> 00:04:05,240
it's also incredibly rare on earth. But here,

66
00:04:05,240 --> 00:04:10,120
the moon might have the answer. Over billions of years,

67
00:04:10,120 --> 00:04:14,240
the solar wind may have built up huge deposits of helium-3 on the moon.

68
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:17,920
Instead of making helium-3, we can mine it.

69
00:04:17,920 --> 00:04:21,280
If we could sift the lunar dust for helium,

70
00:04:21,280 --> 00:04:25,000
we'd have enough fuel to power the entire world for thousands of years.

71
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:29,760
One more argument for establishing a moon base if you weren't convinced already.

72
00:04:29,760 --> 00:04:33,720
Okay, maybe you think building a mini sun

73
00:04:33,720 --> 00:04:39,160
still sounds kind of dangerous. But they'd actually be much safer than most

74
00:04:39,160 --> 00:04:40,600
other types of power plant.

75
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:45,080
A fusion reactor is not like a nuclear plant,

76
00:04:45,080 --> 00:04:49,080
which can melt down catastrophically. If the confinement failed,

77
00:04:49,080 --> 00:04:52,640
then the plasma would expand and cool, and the reaction would stop.

78
00:04:52,640 --> 00:04:55,720
Put simply, it's not a bomb.

79
00:04:55,720 --> 00:04:59,800
The release of radioactive fuel like tritium

80
00:04:59,800 --> 00:05:04,040
could pose a threat to the environment. Tritium could bond with oxygen-making

81
00:05:04,040 --> 00:05:05,200
radioactive water,

82
00:05:05,200 --> 00:05:09,760
which could be dangerous as it seeps into the environment. Fortunately,

83
00:05:09,800 --> 00:05:13,360
there's no more than a few grams of tritium in use at a given time,

84
00:05:13,360 --> 00:05:18,280
so a leak would be quickly diluted. So we've just told you that there's nearly

85
00:05:18,280 --> 00:05:21,680
unlimited energy to be had at no expense to the environment

86
00:05:21,680 --> 00:05:25,640
in something as simple as water. So, what's the catch?

87
00:05:25,640 --> 00:05:30,720
Cost. We simply don't know if fusion power will ever be commercially viable.

88
00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:34,600
Even if they work, they might be too expensive to ever build.

89
00:05:34,600 --> 00:05:38,040
The main drawback is that it's unproven technology.

90
00:05:38,480 --> 00:05:43,120
It's a 10 billion dollar gamble, and that money might be better spent on other

91
00:05:43,120 --> 00:05:43,920
clean energy

92
00:05:43,920 --> 00:05:48,320
that's already proven itself. Maybe we should cut our losses.

93
00:05:48,320 --> 00:05:52,520
Or maybe, when the payoff is unlimited clean energy for

94
00:05:52,520 --> 00:05:56,840
everyone, it might be worth the risk.

95
