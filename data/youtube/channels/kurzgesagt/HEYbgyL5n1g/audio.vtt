00:00.000 --> 00:03.440
Three reasons why we should stop using nuclear energy.

00:03.440 --> 00:06.480
One, nuclear weapons proliferation.

00:06.480 --> 00:10.880
Nuclear technology made a violent entrance onto the world stage.

00:10.880 --> 00:15.200
Just one year after the world's first ever nuclear test explosion in 1944,

00:15.200 --> 00:18.560
two large cities were destroyed by just two single bombs.

00:18.560 --> 00:23.520
After that, reactor technology slowly evolved as a means of generating electricity,

00:23.520 --> 00:27.440
but it's always been intimately connected with nuclear weapons technology.

00:27.440 --> 00:32.560
It's nearly impossible to develop nuclear weapons without access to reactor technology.

00:32.560 --> 00:36.640
In fact, the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty serves the purpose of spreading

00:36.640 --> 00:41.120
nuclear reactor technology without spreading nuclear weapons with limited success.

00:41.680 --> 00:47.040
In 40 years, five countries have developed their own weapons with the help of reactor technology.

00:47.040 --> 00:50.320
The fact of the matter is that it can be very hard to distinguish

00:50.320 --> 00:54.400
a covert nuclear weapons program from the peaceful use of nuclear energy.

00:54.960 --> 01:00.880
In the 1970s, the big nuclear powers were happily selling peaceful technology to smaller countries,

01:00.880 --> 01:03.120
which then developed weapons of their own.

01:03.760 --> 01:08.720
The road to deadly nuclear weapons is always paved with peaceful reactors.

01:09.440 --> 01:11.760
Two, nuclear waste and pollution.

01:12.320 --> 01:15.200
Spent nuclear fuel is not only radioactive,

01:15.200 --> 01:19.920
but also contains extremely poisonous chemical elements like plutonium.

01:19.920 --> 01:24.720
It loses its harmfulness only slowly over several tens of thousands of years.

01:24.720 --> 01:27.840
And there is also a process called reprocessing,

01:27.840 --> 01:31.760
which means the extraction of plutonium from spent nuclear fuel.

01:31.760 --> 01:36.640
It can be used for two purposes, to build nuclear weapons, or to use it as new fuel.

01:36.640 --> 01:41.680
But hardly any of it is used as fuel, because we don't have the right kind of reactors for that.

01:41.680 --> 01:45.440
A milligram will kill you, a few kilograms make an atomic bomb,

01:45.440 --> 01:49.920
and even an inconspicuous country like Germany literally has tons of the stuff

01:49.920 --> 01:54.560
just lying around because reprocessing sounded like a good idea decades ago.

01:54.560 --> 01:55.920
And where will all the waste go?

01:56.480 --> 02:00.080
After dumping it into the ocean was forbidden, we've tried to bury it,

02:00.080 --> 02:04.960
but we can't find a place where it will definitely stay secure for tens of thousands of years.

02:04.960 --> 02:08.240
Over 30 countries operate nearly 400 reactors,

02:08.240 --> 02:11.680
managing several hundred thousands of tons of nuclear waste,

02:11.680 --> 02:17.120
and only one is currently serious about opening a permanent civilian waste storage,

02:17.120 --> 02:18.000
tiny Finland.

02:21.840 --> 02:24.160
Over 60 years of nuclear power usage,

02:24.160 --> 02:29.040
there have been seven major accidents in reactors or facilities dealing with nuclear waste.

02:29.680 --> 02:31.600
Three of those were mostly contained,

02:31.600 --> 02:36.240
but four of them released significant amounts of radioactivity into the environment.

02:36.240 --> 02:41.680
In 1957, 1987, and 2011, large areas of land in Russia,

02:41.680 --> 02:46.560
Ukraine, and Japan were rendered unfit for human habitation for decades to come.

02:47.120 --> 02:51.360
The number of deaths is highly disputed, but probably lies in the thousands.

02:51.920 --> 02:55.520
These disasters happened with nuclear reactors of very different types,

02:55.520 --> 02:59.040
in very different countries, and several decades apart.

02:59.040 --> 03:01.840
Looking at the numbers, we may as well ask ourselves,

03:01.840 --> 03:07.920
are 10% of the world's energy supply worth a devastating disaster every 30 years?

03:07.920 --> 03:12.800
Would 30% be worth another Fukushima or Chernobyl somewhere on Earth every 10 years?

03:13.440 --> 03:17.440
What area would have to be contaminated so we say no more?

03:18.160 --> 03:19.040
Where is the line?

03:19.840 --> 03:22.800
So, should we use nuclear energy?

03:22.800 --> 03:25.040
The risks may outweigh the benefits,

03:25.040 --> 03:29.920
and maybe we should stop looking into this direction and drop this technology for good.

03:29.920 --> 03:32.080
