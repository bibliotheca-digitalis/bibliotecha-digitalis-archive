0	3440	Three reasons why we should stop using nuclear energy.
3440	6480	One, nuclear weapons proliferation.
6480	10880	Nuclear technology made a violent entrance onto the world stage.
10880	15200	Just one year after the world's first ever nuclear test explosion in 1944,
15200	18560	two large cities were destroyed by just two single bombs.
18560	23520	After that, reactor technology slowly evolved as a means of generating electricity,
23520	27440	but it's always been intimately connected with nuclear weapons technology.
27440	32560	It's nearly impossible to develop nuclear weapons without access to reactor technology.
32560	36640	In fact, the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty serves the purpose of spreading
36640	41120	nuclear reactor technology without spreading nuclear weapons with limited success.
41680	47040	In 40 years, five countries have developed their own weapons with the help of reactor technology.
47040	50320	The fact of the matter is that it can be very hard to distinguish
50320	54400	a covert nuclear weapons program from the peaceful use of nuclear energy.
54960	60880	In the 1970s, the big nuclear powers were happily selling peaceful technology to smaller countries,
60880	63120	which then developed weapons of their own.
63760	68720	The road to deadly nuclear weapons is always paved with peaceful reactors.
69440	71760	Two, nuclear waste and pollution.
72320	75200	Spent nuclear fuel is not only radioactive,
75200	79920	but also contains extremely poisonous chemical elements like plutonium.
79920	84720	It loses its harmfulness only slowly over several tens of thousands of years.
84720	87840	And there is also a process called reprocessing,
87840	91760	which means the extraction of plutonium from spent nuclear fuel.
91760	96640	It can be used for two purposes, to build nuclear weapons, or to use it as new fuel.
96640	101680	But hardly any of it is used as fuel, because we don't have the right kind of reactors for that.
101680	105440	A milligram will kill you, a few kilograms make an atomic bomb,
105440	109920	and even an inconspicuous country like Germany literally has tons of the stuff
109920	114560	just lying around because reprocessing sounded like a good idea decades ago.
114560	115920	And where will all the waste go?
116480	120080	After dumping it into the ocean was forbidden, we've tried to bury it,
120080	124960	but we can't find a place where it will definitely stay secure for tens of thousands of years.
124960	128240	Over 30 countries operate nearly 400 reactors,
128240	131680	managing several hundred thousands of tons of nuclear waste,
131680	137120	and only one is currently serious about opening a permanent civilian waste storage,
137120	138000	tiny Finland.
141840	144160	Over 60 years of nuclear power usage,
144160	149040	there have been seven major accidents in reactors or facilities dealing with nuclear waste.
149680	151600	Three of those were mostly contained,
151600	156240	but four of them released significant amounts of radioactivity into the environment.
156240	161680	In 1957, 1987, and 2011, large areas of land in Russia,
161680	166560	Ukraine, and Japan were rendered unfit for human habitation for decades to come.
167120	171360	The number of deaths is highly disputed, but probably lies in the thousands.
171920	175520	These disasters happened with nuclear reactors of very different types,
175520	179040	in very different countries, and several decades apart.
179040	181840	Looking at the numbers, we may as well ask ourselves,
181840	187920	are 10% of the world's energy supply worth a devastating disaster every 30 years?
187920	192800	Would 30% be worth another Fukushima or Chernobyl somewhere on Earth every 10 years?
193440	197440	What area would have to be contaminated so we say no more?
198160	199040	Where is the line?
199840	202800	So, should we use nuclear energy?
202800	205040	The risks may outweigh the benefits,
205040	209920	and maybe we should stop looking into this direction and drop this technology for good.
