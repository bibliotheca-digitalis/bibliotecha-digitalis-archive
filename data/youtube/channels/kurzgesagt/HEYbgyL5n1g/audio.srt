1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,440
Three reasons why we should stop using nuclear energy.

2
00:00:03,440 --> 00:00:06,480
One, nuclear weapons proliferation.

3
00:00:06,480 --> 00:00:10,880
Nuclear technology made a violent entrance onto the world stage.

4
00:00:10,880 --> 00:00:15,200
Just one year after the world's first ever nuclear test explosion in 1944,

5
00:00:15,200 --> 00:00:18,560
two large cities were destroyed by just two single bombs.

6
00:00:18,560 --> 00:00:23,520
After that, reactor technology slowly evolved as a means of generating electricity,

7
00:00:23,520 --> 00:00:27,440
but it's always been intimately connected with nuclear weapons technology.

8
00:00:27,440 --> 00:00:32,560
It's nearly impossible to develop nuclear weapons without access to reactor technology.

9
00:00:32,560 --> 00:00:36,640
In fact, the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty serves the purpose of spreading

10
00:00:36,640 --> 00:00:41,120
nuclear reactor technology without spreading nuclear weapons with limited success.

11
00:00:41,680 --> 00:00:47,040
In 40 years, five countries have developed their own weapons with the help of reactor technology.

12
00:00:47,040 --> 00:00:50,320
The fact of the matter is that it can be very hard to distinguish

13
00:00:50,320 --> 00:00:54,400
a covert nuclear weapons program from the peaceful use of nuclear energy.

14
00:00:54,960 --> 00:01:00,880
In the 1970s, the big nuclear powers were happily selling peaceful technology to smaller countries,

15
00:01:00,880 --> 00:01:03,120
which then developed weapons of their own.

16
00:01:03,760 --> 00:01:08,720
The road to deadly nuclear weapons is always paved with peaceful reactors.

17
00:01:09,440 --> 00:01:11,760
Two, nuclear waste and pollution.

18
00:01:12,320 --> 00:01:15,200
Spent nuclear fuel is not only radioactive,

19
00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:19,920
but also contains extremely poisonous chemical elements like plutonium.

20
00:01:19,920 --> 00:01:24,720
It loses its harmfulness only slowly over several tens of thousands of years.

21
00:01:24,720 --> 00:01:27,840
And there is also a process called reprocessing,

22
00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:31,760
which means the extraction of plutonium from spent nuclear fuel.

23
00:01:31,760 --> 00:01:36,640
It can be used for two purposes, to build nuclear weapons, or to use it as new fuel.

24
00:01:36,640 --> 00:01:41,680
But hardly any of it is used as fuel, because we don't have the right kind of reactors for that.

25
00:01:41,680 --> 00:01:45,440
A milligram will kill you, a few kilograms make an atomic bomb,

26
00:01:45,440 --> 00:01:49,920
and even an inconspicuous country like Germany literally has tons of the stuff

27
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:54,560
just lying around because reprocessing sounded like a good idea decades ago.

28
00:01:54,560 --> 00:01:55,920
And where will all the waste go?

29
00:01:56,480 --> 00:02:00,080
After dumping it into the ocean was forbidden, we've tried to bury it,

30
00:02:00,080 --> 00:02:04,960
but we can't find a place where it will definitely stay secure for tens of thousands of years.

31
00:02:04,960 --> 00:02:08,240
Over 30 countries operate nearly 400 reactors,

32
00:02:08,240 --> 00:02:11,680
managing several hundred thousands of tons of nuclear waste,

33
00:02:11,680 --> 00:02:17,120
and only one is currently serious about opening a permanent civilian waste storage,

34
00:02:17,120 --> 00:02:18,000
tiny Finland.

35
00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:24,160
Over 60 years of nuclear power usage,

36
00:02:24,160 --> 00:02:29,040
there have been seven major accidents in reactors or facilities dealing with nuclear waste.

37
00:02:29,680 --> 00:02:31,600
Three of those were mostly contained,

38
00:02:31,600 --> 00:02:36,240
but four of them released significant amounts of radioactivity into the environment.

39
00:02:36,240 --> 00:02:41,680
In 1957, 1987, and 2011, large areas of land in Russia,

40
00:02:41,680 --> 00:02:46,560
Ukraine, and Japan were rendered unfit for human habitation for decades to come.

41
00:02:47,120 --> 00:02:51,360
The number of deaths is highly disputed, but probably lies in the thousands.

42
00:02:51,920 --> 00:02:55,520
These disasters happened with nuclear reactors of very different types,

43
00:02:55,520 --> 00:02:59,040
in very different countries, and several decades apart.

44
00:02:59,040 --> 00:03:01,840
Looking at the numbers, we may as well ask ourselves,

45
00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:07,920
are 10% of the world's energy supply worth a devastating disaster every 30 years?

46
00:03:07,920 --> 00:03:12,800
Would 30% be worth another Fukushima or Chernobyl somewhere on Earth every 10 years?

47
00:03:13,440 --> 00:03:17,440
What area would have to be contaminated so we say no more?

48
00:03:18,160 --> 00:03:19,040
Where is the line?

49
00:03:19,840 --> 00:03:22,800
So, should we use nuclear energy?

50
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:25,040
The risks may outweigh the benefits,

51
00:03:25,040 --> 00:03:29,920
and maybe we should stop looking into this direction and drop this technology for good.

52
00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:32,080
