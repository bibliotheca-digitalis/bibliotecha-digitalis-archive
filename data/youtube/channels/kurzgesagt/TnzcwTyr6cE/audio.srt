00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,000
What if you could use genetic engineering to stop humanity's most dangerous predator?

2
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:11,820
The deadliest animal on the planet responsible for the death of billions,

3
00:00:11,820 --> 00:00:17,800
the mighty mosquito. Along with other diseases, it plays host to malaria,

4
00:00:17,800 --> 00:00:23,120
one of the cruelest parasites on Earth, possibly the single biggest killer of humans in history.

5
00:00:23,120 --> 00:00:29,040
In 2015 alone, hundreds of millions were infected and almost half a million people died.

6
00:00:29,040 --> 00:00:34,780
A new technology could help us eradicate malaria forever. But to do so,

7
00:00:34,780 --> 00:00:40,880
we need to engineer a whole animal population. This is not a hypothetical problem. The modified

8
00:00:40,880 --> 00:00:48,000
mosquitoes already exist in a lab. Should we use the technology? And is malaria bad enough to risk it?

9
00:00:48,000 --> 00:01:05,160
Malaria is caused by a group of microorganisms, plasmodia. Very weird microorganisms that consist

10
00:01:05,160 --> 00:01:11,720
of just a single cell. They're parasites that completely rely on mosquitoes. Malaria always

11
00:01:11,720 --> 00:01:17,280
starts with an insect bite. In its salivary glands, thousands of sporozoites wait until

12
00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:22,280
the insect penetrates your skin. Immediately after invading you, they head for the liver,

13
00:01:22,280 --> 00:01:27,400
where they quietly enter big cells and hide from the immune system. For up to a month,

14
00:01:27,400 --> 00:01:32,800
they stay here in stealth mode, consuming the cells alive and changing into their next form,

15
00:01:32,800 --> 00:01:39,280
small drop-like myriozoites. They multiply, generating thousands of themselves and then

16
00:01:39,280 --> 00:01:44,920
burst out of the cells. So thousands of parasites head into the bloodstream to look for their next

17
00:01:45,320 --> 00:01:51,040
red blood cells. To stay unnoticed, they wrap themselves in the membranes of the cells they

18
00:01:51,040 --> 00:01:56,760
killed. Imagine that. Killing someone from the inside and then taking their skin as camouflage.

19
00:01:56,760 --> 00:02:03,320
Brutal. They now violently attack red blood cells, multiplying inside them until they burst,

20
00:02:03,320 --> 00:02:09,640
then finding more red blood cells, and this cycle repeats over and over. Pieces of dead cells spread

21
00:02:09,640 --> 00:02:14,840
lots of toxic waste material, which activates a powerful immune response, causing flu-like symptoms.

22
00:02:15,720 --> 00:02:21,040
Among the symptoms are high fever, sweats and chills, convulsions, headaches, and sometimes

23
00:02:21,040 --> 00:02:26,240
vomiting and diarrhea. If malaria breaches the blood-brain barrier, it can cause coma,

24
00:02:26,240 --> 00:02:32,600
neurological damage, or death. The parasites are ready for evacuation now. When another

25
00:02:32,600 --> 00:02:39,200
mosquito bites the infected human, they get a ride. The cycle can start over. In 2015,

26
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:43,020
the Zika virus, which causes horrible birth defects if it infects pregnant women,

27
00:02:43,020 --> 00:02:49,660
spread rapidly into new areas around the globe. It too is carried by a mosquito. The mosquito is

28
00:02:49,660 --> 00:02:54,820
the perfect carrier for human diseases. They've been around for at least 200 million years. There

29
00:02:54,820 --> 00:03:01,460
are trillions of them, and a single one can lay up to 300 eggs at a time. They are practically

30
00:03:01,460 --> 00:03:07,420
impossible to eradicate and the perfect parasite taxi. But today we have new revolutionary

31
00:03:07,420 --> 00:03:13,220
technology that could enable us to finally win the war against them. CRISPR. For the first time

32
00:03:13,220 --> 00:03:19,180
in human history, we have the tools to make fast, large-scale changes to entire species,

33
00:03:19,180 --> 00:03:26,460
changing their genetic information as we please. So instead of attacking isolated groups of insects,

34
00:03:26,460 --> 00:03:33,100
why not just change the types that transmit diseases? Using genetic engineering, scientists

35
00:03:33,100 --> 00:03:38,380
successfully created a strain of mosquitoes that are immune to the malaria parasite by adding a

36
00:03:38,380 --> 00:03:44,380
new antibody gene that specifically targets plasmodium. These mosquitoes will never spread

37
00:03:44,380 --> 00:03:51,220
malaria. But just changing genetic information is not enough. The edits would only be inherited

38
00:03:51,220 --> 00:03:56,740
by half the offspring because most genes have two versions inside the genome as a fail-safe. So

39
00:03:56,740 --> 00:04:01,260
after just two generations, at most only half of the offspring would carry the engineered gene.

40
00:04:01,300 --> 00:04:07,460
In a population of billions of mosquitoes, they would hardly make a difference. A genetic

41
00:04:07,460 --> 00:04:12,780
engineering method called the gene drive solves this problem. It forces the new gene to become

42
00:04:12,780 --> 00:04:18,380
dominant in the following generations, overpowering the old gene almost completely. Thanks to this

43
00:04:18,380 --> 00:04:24,700
twist, 99.5% of all the engineered mosquitoes' offspring will carry the anti-malaria edit.

44
00:04:24,700 --> 00:04:30,340
If we were to release enough engineered mosquitoes into the wild to mate with normal mosquitoes,

45
00:04:30,420 --> 00:04:36,020
the malaria blocking genes would spread extremely quickly. As the new gene becomes a permanent

46
00:04:36,020 --> 00:04:41,220
feature of the mosquito population, plasmodium would lose its home base. Scientists hoped that

47
00:04:41,220 --> 00:04:46,540
the change would be so fast that they could not adapt to it quickly enough. Malaria could virtually

48
00:04:46,540 --> 00:04:51,420
disappear. If you take into account that nearly half a million children are killed by it every

49
00:04:51,420 --> 00:04:56,740
year, about five have died since this video started. Some scientists argue that we should

50
00:04:56,740 --> 00:05:02,100
use the technology sooner rather than later. The mosquitoes themselves would probably only

51
00:05:02,100 --> 00:05:07,900
profit from this. They don't have anything to gain from carrying parasites. And this might only be

52
00:05:07,900 --> 00:05:14,060
the first step. Malaria might just be the beginning. Different mosquitoes also carry dengue fever and

53
00:05:14,060 --> 00:05:21,100
Zika. Ticks transmit Lyme disease. Flies transmit sleeping sickness. Fleas transmit the plague. We

54
00:05:21,140 --> 00:05:26,100
could save millions of lives and prevent suffering on an unbelievable scale. So,

55
00:05:26,100 --> 00:05:31,500
why haven't we done this yet? For one, CRISPR editing is barely four years old,

56
00:05:31,500 --> 00:05:38,180
so until very recently, we just couldn't do it as fast and easily. And there are valid concerns.

57
00:05:38,180 --> 00:05:43,340
Never before have humans consciously changed the genetic code of a free-living organism on this

58
00:05:43,340 --> 00:05:50,220
scale. Once we do it, there is no going back. So it has to be done right, because there could

59
00:05:50,220 --> 00:05:56,180
be unwanted consequences if we set out to edit nature. In the specific case of malaria, though,

60
00:05:56,180 --> 00:06:00,800
the risk might be acceptable. Since the genetic modification doesn't make a big change in the

61
00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:07,020
overall genome, it only changes a very specific part. The worst-case scenario here is probably

62
00:06:07,020 --> 00:06:12,700
that it might not work or that the parasite adapts in a negative way. There is still much

63
00:06:12,700 --> 00:06:20,060
debate. Technology as powerful as gene drive needs to be handled with a lot of care. But at

64
00:06:20,060 --> 00:06:25,900
some point, we have to ask ourselves, is it unethical to not use this technology when every

65
00:06:25,900 --> 00:06:32,820
day 1,000 children die? Humanity has to decide how to act on this in the next few years. The

66
00:06:32,820 --> 00:06:41,740
public discussion is way behind the technology in this case. What do you think? This video was
