0	7000	What if you could use genetic engineering to stop humanity's most dangerous predator?
7000	11820	The deadliest animal on the planet responsible for the death of billions,
11820	17800	the mighty mosquito. Along with other diseases, it plays host to malaria,
17800	23120	one of the cruelest parasites on Earth, possibly the single biggest killer of humans in history.
23120	29040	In 2015 alone, hundreds of millions were infected and almost half a million people died.
29040	34780	A new technology could help us eradicate malaria forever. But to do so,
34780	40880	we need to engineer a whole animal population. This is not a hypothetical problem. The modified
40880	48000	mosquitoes already exist in a lab. Should we use the technology? And is malaria bad enough to risk it?
48000	65160	Malaria is caused by a group of microorganisms, plasmodia. Very weird microorganisms that consist
65160	71720	of just a single cell. They're parasites that completely rely on mosquitoes. Malaria always
71720	77280	starts with an insect bite. In its salivary glands, thousands of sporozoites wait until
77280	82280	the insect penetrates your skin. Immediately after invading you, they head for the liver,
82280	87400	where they quietly enter big cells and hide from the immune system. For up to a month,
87400	92800	they stay here in stealth mode, consuming the cells alive and changing into their next form,
92800	99280	small drop-like myriozoites. They multiply, generating thousands of themselves and then
99280	104920	burst out of the cells. So thousands of parasites head into the bloodstream to look for their next
105320	111040	red blood cells. To stay unnoticed, they wrap themselves in the membranes of the cells they
111040	116760	killed. Imagine that. Killing someone from the inside and then taking their skin as camouflage.
116760	123320	Brutal. They now violently attack red blood cells, multiplying inside them until they burst,
123320	129640	then finding more red blood cells, and this cycle repeats over and over. Pieces of dead cells spread
129640	134840	lots of toxic waste material, which activates a powerful immune response, causing flu-like symptoms.
135720	141040	Among the symptoms are high fever, sweats and chills, convulsions, headaches, and sometimes
141040	146240	vomiting and diarrhea. If malaria breaches the blood-brain barrier, it can cause coma,
146240	152600	neurological damage, or death. The parasites are ready for evacuation now. When another
152600	159200	mosquito bites the infected human, they get a ride. The cycle can start over. In 2015,
159200	163020	the Zika virus, which causes horrible birth defects if it infects pregnant women,
163020	169660	spread rapidly into new areas around the globe. It too is carried by a mosquito. The mosquito is
169660	174820	the perfect carrier for human diseases. They've been around for at least 200 million years. There
174820	181460	are trillions of them, and a single one can lay up to 300 eggs at a time. They are practically
181460	187420	impossible to eradicate and the perfect parasite taxi. But today we have new revolutionary
187420	193220	technology that could enable us to finally win the war against them. CRISPR. For the first time
193220	199180	in human history, we have the tools to make fast, large-scale changes to entire species,
199180	206460	changing their genetic information as we please. So instead of attacking isolated groups of insects,
206460	213100	why not just change the types that transmit diseases? Using genetic engineering, scientists
213100	218380	successfully created a strain of mosquitoes that are immune to the malaria parasite by adding a
218380	224380	new antibody gene that specifically targets plasmodium. These mosquitoes will never spread
224380	231220	malaria. But just changing genetic information is not enough. The edits would only be inherited
231220	236740	by half the offspring because most genes have two versions inside the genome as a fail-safe. So
236740	241260	after just two generations, at most only half of the offspring would carry the engineered gene.
241300	247460	In a population of billions of mosquitoes, they would hardly make a difference. A genetic
247460	252780	engineering method called the gene drive solves this problem. It forces the new gene to become
252780	258380	dominant in the following generations, overpowering the old gene almost completely. Thanks to this
258380	264700	twist, 99.5% of all the engineered mosquitoes' offspring will carry the anti-malaria edit.
264700	270340	If we were to release enough engineered mosquitoes into the wild to mate with normal mosquitoes,
270420	276020	the malaria blocking genes would spread extremely quickly. As the new gene becomes a permanent
276020	281220	feature of the mosquito population, plasmodium would lose its home base. Scientists hoped that
281220	286540	the change would be so fast that they could not adapt to it quickly enough. Malaria could virtually
286540	291420	disappear. If you take into account that nearly half a million children are killed by it every
291420	296740	year, about five have died since this video started. Some scientists argue that we should
296740	302100	use the technology sooner rather than later. The mosquitoes themselves would probably only
302100	307900	profit from this. They don't have anything to gain from carrying parasites. And this might only be
307900	314060	the first step. Malaria might just be the beginning. Different mosquitoes also carry dengue fever and
314060	321100	Zika. Ticks transmit Lyme disease. Flies transmit sleeping sickness. Fleas transmit the plague. We
321140	326100	could save millions of lives and prevent suffering on an unbelievable scale. So,
326100	331500	why haven't we done this yet? For one, CRISPR editing is barely four years old,
331500	338180	so until very recently, we just couldn't do it as fast and easily. And there are valid concerns.
338180	343340	Never before have humans consciously changed the genetic code of a free-living organism on this
343340	350220	scale. Once we do it, there is no going back. So it has to be done right, because there could
350220	356180	be unwanted consequences if we set out to edit nature. In the specific case of malaria, though,
356180	360800	the risk might be acceptable. Since the genetic modification doesn't make a big change in the
360800	367020	overall genome, it only changes a very specific part. The worst-case scenario here is probably
367020	372700	that it might not work or that the parasite adapts in a negative way. There is still much
372700	380060	debate. Technology as powerful as gene drive needs to be handled with a lot of care. But at
380060	385900	some point, we have to ask ourselves, is it unethical to not use this technology when every
385900	392820	day 1,000 children die? Humanity has to decide how to act on this in the next few years. The
392820	401740	public discussion is way behind the technology in this case. What do you think? This video was
