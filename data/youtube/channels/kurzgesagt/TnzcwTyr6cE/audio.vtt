What if you could use genetic engineering to stop humanity's most dangerous predator?

00:07.000 --> 00:11.820
The deadliest animal on the planet responsible for the death of billions,

00:11.820 --> 00:17.800
the mighty mosquito. Along with other diseases, it plays host to malaria,

00:17.800 --> 00:23.120
one of the cruelest parasites on Earth, possibly the single biggest killer of humans in history.

00:23.120 --> 00:29.040
In 2015 alone, hundreds of millions were infected and almost half a million people died.

00:29.040 --> 00:34.780
A new technology could help us eradicate malaria forever. But to do so,

00:34.780 --> 00:40.880
we need to engineer a whole animal population. This is not a hypothetical problem. The modified

00:40.880 --> 00:48.000
mosquitoes already exist in a lab. Should we use the technology? And is malaria bad enough to risk it?

00:48.000 --> 01:05.160
Malaria is caused by a group of microorganisms, plasmodia. Very weird microorganisms that consist

01:05.160 --> 01:11.720
of just a single cell. They're parasites that completely rely on mosquitoes. Malaria always

01:11.720 --> 01:17.280
starts with an insect bite. In its salivary glands, thousands of sporozoites wait until

01:17.280 --> 01:22.280
the insect penetrates your skin. Immediately after invading you, they head for the liver,

01:22.280 --> 01:27.400
where they quietly enter big cells and hide from the immune system. For up to a month,

01:27.400 --> 01:32.800
they stay here in stealth mode, consuming the cells alive and changing into their next form,

01:32.800 --> 01:39.280
small drop-like myriozoites. They multiply, generating thousands of themselves and then

01:39.280 --> 01:44.920
burst out of the cells. So thousands of parasites head into the bloodstream to look for their next

01:45.320 --> 01:51.040
red blood cells. To stay unnoticed, they wrap themselves in the membranes of the cells they

01:51.040 --> 01:56.760
killed. Imagine that. Killing someone from the inside and then taking their skin as camouflage.

01:56.760 --> 02:03.320
Brutal. They now violently attack red blood cells, multiplying inside them until they burst,

02:03.320 --> 02:09.640
then finding more red blood cells, and this cycle repeats over and over. Pieces of dead cells spread

02:09.640 --> 02:14.840
lots of toxic waste material, which activates a powerful immune response, causing flu-like symptoms.

02:15.720 --> 02:21.040
Among the symptoms are high fever, sweats and chills, convulsions, headaches, and sometimes

02:21.040 --> 02:26.240
vomiting and diarrhea. If malaria breaches the blood-brain barrier, it can cause coma,

02:26.240 --> 02:32.600
neurological damage, or death. The parasites are ready for evacuation now. When another

02:32.600 --> 02:39.200
mosquito bites the infected human, they get a ride. The cycle can start over. In 2015,

02:39.200 --> 02:43.020
the Zika virus, which causes horrible birth defects if it infects pregnant women,

02:43.020 --> 02:49.660
spread rapidly into new areas around the globe. It too is carried by a mosquito. The mosquito is

02:49.660 --> 02:54.820
the perfect carrier for human diseases. They've been around for at least 200 million years. There

02:54.820 --> 03:01.460
are trillions of them, and a single one can lay up to 300 eggs at a time. They are practically

03:01.460 --> 03:07.420
impossible to eradicate and the perfect parasite taxi. But today we have new revolutionary

03:07.420 --> 03:13.220
technology that could enable us to finally win the war against them. CRISPR. For the first time

03:13.220 --> 03:19.180
in human history, we have the tools to make fast, large-scale changes to entire species,

03:19.180 --> 03:26.460
changing their genetic information as we please. So instead of attacking isolated groups of insects,

03:26.460 --> 03:33.100
why not just change the types that transmit diseases? Using genetic engineering, scientists

03:33.100 --> 03:38.380
successfully created a strain of mosquitoes that are immune to the malaria parasite by adding a

03:38.380 --> 03:44.380
new antibody gene that specifically targets plasmodium. These mosquitoes will never spread

03:44.380 --> 03:51.220
malaria. But just changing genetic information is not enough. The edits would only be inherited

03:51.220 --> 03:56.740
by half the offspring because most genes have two versions inside the genome as a fail-safe. So

03:56.740 --> 04:01.260
after just two generations, at most only half of the offspring would carry the engineered gene.

04:01.300 --> 04:07.460
In a population of billions of mosquitoes, they would hardly make a difference. A genetic

04:07.460 --> 04:12.780
engineering method called the gene drive solves this problem. It forces the new gene to become

04:12.780 --> 04:18.380
dominant in the following generations, overpowering the old gene almost completely. Thanks to this

04:18.380 --> 04:24.700
twist, 99.5% of all the engineered mosquitoes' offspring will carry the anti-malaria edit.

04:24.700 --> 04:30.340
If we were to release enough engineered mosquitoes into the wild to mate with normal mosquitoes,

04:30.420 --> 04:36.020
the malaria blocking genes would spread extremely quickly. As the new gene becomes a permanent

04:36.020 --> 04:41.220
feature of the mosquito population, plasmodium would lose its home base. Scientists hoped that

04:41.220 --> 04:46.540
the change would be so fast that they could not adapt to it quickly enough. Malaria could virtually

04:46.540 --> 04:51.420
disappear. If you take into account that nearly half a million children are killed by it every

04:51.420 --> 04:56.740
year, about five have died since this video started. Some scientists argue that we should

04:56.740 --> 05:02.100
use the technology sooner rather than later. The mosquitoes themselves would probably only

05:02.100 --> 05:07.900
profit from this. They don't have anything to gain from carrying parasites. And this might only be

05:07.900 --> 05:14.060
the first step. Malaria might just be the beginning. Different mosquitoes also carry dengue fever and

05:14.060 --> 05:21.100
Zika. Ticks transmit Lyme disease. Flies transmit sleeping sickness. Fleas transmit the plague. We

05:21.140 --> 05:26.100
could save millions of lives and prevent suffering on an unbelievable scale. So,

05:26.100 --> 05:31.500
why haven't we done this yet? For one, CRISPR editing is barely four years old,

05:31.500 --> 05:38.180
so until very recently, we just couldn't do it as fast and easily. And there are valid concerns.

05:38.180 --> 05:43.340
Never before have humans consciously changed the genetic code of a free-living organism on this

05:43.340 --> 05:50.220
scale. Once we do it, there is no going back. So it has to be done right, because there could

05:50.220 --> 05:56.180
be unwanted consequences if we set out to edit nature. In the specific case of malaria, though,

05:56.180 --> 06:00.800
the risk might be acceptable. Since the genetic modification doesn't make a big change in the

06:00.800 --> 06:07.020
overall genome, it only changes a very specific part. The worst-case scenario here is probably

06:07.020 --> 06:12.700
that it might not work or that the parasite adapts in a negative way. There is still much

06:12.700 --> 06:20.060
debate. Technology as powerful as gene drive needs to be handled with a lot of care. But at

06:20.060 --> 06:25.900
some point, we have to ask ourselves, is it unethical to not use this technology when every

06:25.900 --> 06:32.820
day 1,000 children die? Humanity has to decide how to act on this in the next few years. The

06:32.820 --> 06:41.740
public discussion is way behind the technology in this case. What do you think? This video was
