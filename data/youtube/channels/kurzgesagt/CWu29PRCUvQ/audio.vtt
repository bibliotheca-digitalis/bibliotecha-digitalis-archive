00:00.000 --> 00:05.500
Imagine someone coming into your kitchen and taking a few tools, a pan, and your garbage.

00:05.500 --> 00:08.000
Then they bury everything in the woods.

00:08.000 --> 00:13.000
12,000 years later, an archaeologist is trying to figure out who you were,

00:13.000 --> 00:19.500
what was important to you, what video games you played, what you believed in, and what informed your decisions.

00:19.500 --> 00:24.500
Because you happened to live during a remarkable time in human history.

00:24.500 --> 00:31.500
The planetary revolution, when humanity transitioned, becoming a multi-planetary species.

00:31.500 --> 00:36.000
In that time, our numbers would explode by orders of magnitude,

00:36.000 --> 00:41.000
our technology and standard of living would improve to levels previously thought impossible,

00:41.000 --> 00:45.000
and our self-conception would change forever.

00:45.000 --> 00:50.500
And all the future archaeologist has to learn about is your junk in the woods.

00:50.500 --> 00:58.000
While we can only hope that this will be someone's problem in 12,000 years, we have the same problem today.

00:58.000 --> 01:03.000
We're trying to reconstruct a revolution that took place 12,000 years ago.

01:03.000 --> 01:10.500
Today, only shadows remain of the people who experienced our distant past as their present.

01:10.500 --> 01:14.500
What remains from our past?

01:14.500 --> 01:20.000
We can look at our present in crispy 4k in color and sound.

01:20.000 --> 01:24.000
Three generations ago, the world was just black and white.

01:24.000 --> 01:28.500
One more generation and we see the world through blurred photographs.

01:28.500 --> 01:34.500
Further back, paintings and texts become our main way of experiencing the past.

01:34.500 --> 01:39.500
A mere 20 generations before us today, every written word had to be copied by hand,

01:39.500 --> 01:43.500
and reports became more scarce and less reliable.

01:43.500 --> 01:48.000
The first historian lived a mere 100 generations ago.

01:48.000 --> 01:55.000
For him, there are only epics and legends and dead kings bragging on pieces of stone.

01:55.000 --> 02:03.500
250 generations ago, there are only fragments left in the ground and images stripped of their original meaning.

02:03.500 --> 02:07.500
Eventually, humanity becomes basically invisible.

02:07.500 --> 02:11.000
Still, we do know some things about our ancestors.

02:11.000 --> 02:16.000
Let's try to tell their story and what it means for us today.

02:16.000 --> 02:19.500
The greatest transition in human history.

02:19.500 --> 02:26.500
For some 2 million years or roughly 80,000 generations, the life of our ancestors was basically the same.

02:26.500 --> 02:33.000
It was around 20,000 years or 800 generations ago that the behaviorally modern humans began a process

02:33.000 --> 02:36.000
that would change our lifestyle forever.

02:36.000 --> 02:38.500
At first, gradually, for some of us.

02:38.500 --> 02:41.000
Then faster, for more of us.

02:41.000 --> 02:44.500
And then, suddenly, for almost all of us.

02:44.500 --> 02:48.500
Back then, there were about 1 million modern humans on Earth.

02:48.500 --> 02:53.000
Most other human species had died out, probably with a little help from us.

02:53.000 --> 02:57.000
Our ancestors' biology had given them the necessary tools.

02:57.000 --> 03:02.500
A general intelligence to understand things, a social intelligence to understand each other,

03:02.500 --> 03:07.500
and language to express abstract ideas and create new concepts.

03:07.500 --> 03:10.500
These were people just like you.

03:10.500 --> 03:16.000
They suffered and experienced joy, were bored, cried, and laughed.

03:16.000 --> 03:19.000
They lived in communities of a few dozen people.

03:19.000 --> 03:24.000
They controlled fire and had tools made from wood, stone, and bone,

03:24.000 --> 03:28.500
told stories, mourned their dead, and created art.

03:28.500 --> 03:33.500
They traded with other tribes, from obsidian to shellfish.

03:33.500 --> 03:36.500
Some hunted big game and were very mobile,

03:36.500 --> 03:39.000
others relied more on plants they collected,

03:39.000 --> 03:43.500
and others mostly stayed in one area with an abundance of seafood.

03:43.500 --> 03:47.500
This was the common state of humanity for most of our history.

03:47.500 --> 03:54.500
Until a slow transition, step by step, turned into a revolution.

03:54.500 --> 03:57.500
Step by step.

03:57.500 --> 04:01.500
The first solid evidence for this stems from the Jordan Valley,

04:01.500 --> 04:05.500
where our ancestors collected wild wheat more than 20,000 years ago.

04:05.500 --> 04:09.500
They noticed that seeds in the ground made more plants the next year.

04:09.500 --> 04:14.500
If they put good ones in one place, the next year they had more of the good ones.

04:14.500 --> 04:17.500
This was a great supplement to hunting and gathering.

04:17.500 --> 04:20.500
You could prepare some crops, return next year,

04:20.500 --> 04:24.500
build a temporary settlement, and have a secure food supply.

04:24.500 --> 04:30.000
Our ancestors used these bonus crops to bake the first bread and brew the first beer.

04:30.000 --> 04:35.000
With every generation, they gathered deeper knowledge about the plants and animals around them

04:35.000 --> 04:38.000
and how to manipulate them to their advantage.

04:38.000 --> 04:40.000
But there was a lot to learn.

04:40.000 --> 04:43.000
Very slowly, from generation to generation,

04:43.000 --> 04:47.500
pockets of knowledge expanded and were passed along to be expanded again.

04:47.500 --> 04:54.000
This early agriculture started to drastically reduce the space our ancestors needed to feed one individual,

04:54.000 --> 04:57.500
which made it possible to stay in one place longer.

04:57.500 --> 05:03.000
Around 12,000 years ago, these little pieces of progress had reached a critical mass.

05:03.000 --> 05:08.000
Most of the calories we consume today stem from about 15 different founder crops

05:08.000 --> 05:12.500
that humans began to domesticate in earnest in the next few thousand years.

05:12.500 --> 05:17.500
What we call the agricultural revolution was not a thing that began suddenly one day.

05:17.500 --> 05:22.500
It was a slow process driven by small groups over many generations.

05:22.500 --> 05:27.000
Eventually, gradual change gave rise to a new era.

05:28.000 --> 05:31.000
The human era.

05:31.000 --> 05:34.500
During the next few thousand years, progress would speed up

05:34.500 --> 05:40.000
and turn hunter-gatherers into farmers who lived in villages, towns, and then cities.

05:40.000 --> 05:46.500
When farmers moved into new areas, they replaced the nomadic tribes or turned them into farmers too.

05:46.500 --> 05:49.500
This was neither easy nor painless.

05:49.500 --> 05:56.000
In the early days, people had a diverse diet made up of up to 250 different plants and animals.

05:56.000 --> 06:01.500
For some of the groups transitioning to agriculture, the variation in their diets declined drastically

06:01.500 --> 06:05.000
and some even seemed to have been undernourished.

06:05.000 --> 06:11.000
And living close together and with animals created a breeding ground for disease.

06:11.000 --> 06:16.000
Virtually every infectious disease caused by microorganisms that have adapted to humans

06:16.000 --> 06:18.500
arose in the last 10,000 years.

06:18.500 --> 06:23.500
Cholera, smallpox, measles, influenza, chickenpox, and malaria.

06:24.000 --> 06:28.000
Mortality, especially among children, rose drastically.

06:28.000 --> 06:34.000
Still, our numbers grew because living in the same place enabled women to bear far more children than before

06:34.000 --> 06:39.000
and for a farmer, more kids mean more hands to work the fields.

06:39.000 --> 06:43.000
Even with more people dying younger, villages and towns grew.

06:43.000 --> 06:46.500
The number of humans on Earth exploded.

06:46.500 --> 06:53.000
About 100 generations after the beginning of the human era, there were already 4 million of us.

06:53.000 --> 06:59.500
This increased the need for food and forced people to come up with ever more efficient ways of producing calories,

06:59.500 --> 07:02.500
solidifying our new lifestyle.

07:02.500 --> 07:07.500
Going back to hunting and gathering would have just meant death by starvation for most.

07:07.500 --> 07:11.500
One question remains unanswered. Why?

07:11.500 --> 07:16.500
Why would people exchange the freedom of living off nature with a huge variety in food

07:16.500 --> 07:20.500
for the grind of agriculture and often more limited diets?

07:20.500 --> 07:22.500
Nobody knows for sure.

07:22.500 --> 07:25.500
Climate change seems to have made the transition possible

07:25.500 --> 07:31.500
and some scientists argue that it was caused by external factors like undernourishment or overpopulation,

07:31.500 --> 07:34.000
both highly contested.

07:34.000 --> 07:38.500
Today, the most widely accepted idea is that it was a deliberate choice,

07:38.500 --> 07:42.000
made by countless communities around the globe.

07:42.000 --> 07:45.500
Maybe it's also connected with what makes us human,

07:45.500 --> 07:52.000
the ability to come together, develop shared identities, and exchange stories and knowledge.

07:52.000 --> 07:57.000
Some archaeologists think that groups of hunter-gatherers traveled long and far to celebrate,

07:57.000 --> 07:59.500
to hold feasts and rituals.

07:59.500 --> 08:03.500
They would have used these occasions to talk about their version of innovation,

08:03.500 --> 08:06.000
better hunting and tool-making techniques,

08:06.000 --> 08:10.500
how to catch and breed animals, and which plants could be collected and multiplied.

08:10.500 --> 08:13.500
Maybe they even exchanged seeds.

08:13.500 --> 08:18.000
It's not unlikely that these gatherings were the catalysts that spread the knowledge of agriculture

08:18.000 --> 08:21.000
through the many isolated groups of humanity.

08:21.000 --> 08:26.500
Ultimately ending a lifestyle that was common to our species for thousands of generations.

08:26.500 --> 08:31.500
So by being able to come together, celebrate, share, and learn from one another,

08:31.500 --> 08:35.500
these humans might have taken the steps that led to our modern world,

08:35.500 --> 08:38.500
and we have much to be grateful for.

08:38.500 --> 08:44.000
We are still the same humans today, even if it often doesn't feel that way.

08:44.000 --> 08:49.500
Maybe it's time to come together to share what we know and celebrate our existence once again,

08:49.500 --> 08:52.000
to begin another peaceful transition.

08:52.000 --> 08:56.500
Maybe the planetary revolution that will change everything once more.

08:56.500 --> 09:04.000
So, hopefully, in another 12,000 years, our descendants will look back on us today with gratitude

09:04.000 --> 09:09.000
for the amazing world they are able to inhabit.

09:09.000 --> 09:13.000
To celebrate the achievements of our ancestors in the last 12,000 years,

09:13.000 --> 09:15.500
and to look with hope towards the next 12,000,

09:15.500 --> 09:21.500
we present you with the fifth human-era calendar for the year 12,021.

09:21.500 --> 09:25.500
This time, it's all about the journey of humanity.

09:25.500 --> 09:30.500
Beginning tens of thousands of years ago, leading into the revolution of agriculture,

09:30.500 --> 09:35.000
to ancient high civilizations, and the beginning of modern times,

09:35.000 --> 09:38.000
culminating in a vision for our future.

09:38.000 --> 09:43.000
You can get the limited edition now until we sell out, and then never again.

09:43.000 --> 09:49.000
As always, the calendar features 12 illustrated pages printed on high-quality paper in Europe and the US.

09:49.000 --> 09:52.500
And this year, the cover is especially shiny.

09:52.500 --> 09:58.000
Not only does the calendar look great on walls and makes it easier to dream about a glorious future,

09:58.000 --> 10:04.000
and realize how far we've come as a species, it's also the best way to support Kurzgesagt.

10:04.000 --> 10:10.000
The calendar enables us to put in the time our videos need and release them for free for everyone.

10:10.000 --> 10:16.500
If you want, you can get the calendar with a hoodie or infographic posters or plushie, we've made a few deals for you.

10:16.500 --> 10:20.500
Thank you so much to the thousands of people who get the calendar every year,

10:20.500 --> 10:25.000
and to the burbs who love what we try to do on this channel.

10:25.000 --> 10:33.000
We wish you a happy year 12,021, and let's all hope that it will be less exciting than 12,020.

10:40.000 --> 10:42.000
Thank you for watching.
