0	5500	Imagine someone coming into your kitchen and taking a few tools, a pan, and your garbage.
5500	8000	Then they bury everything in the woods.
8000	13000	12,000 years later, an archaeologist is trying to figure out who you were,
13000	19500	what was important to you, what video games you played, what you believed in, and what informed your decisions.
19500	24500	Because you happened to live during a remarkable time in human history.
24500	31500	The planetary revolution, when humanity transitioned, becoming a multi-planetary species.
31500	36000	In that time, our numbers would explode by orders of magnitude,
36000	41000	our technology and standard of living would improve to levels previously thought impossible,
41000	45000	and our self-conception would change forever.
45000	50500	And all the future archaeologist has to learn about is your junk in the woods.
50500	58000	While we can only hope that this will be someone's problem in 12,000 years, we have the same problem today.
58000	63000	We're trying to reconstruct a revolution that took place 12,000 years ago.
63000	70500	Today, only shadows remain of the people who experienced our distant past as their present.
70500	74500	What remains from our past?
74500	80000	We can look at our present in crispy 4k in color and sound.
80000	84000	Three generations ago, the world was just black and white.
84000	88500	One more generation and we see the world through blurred photographs.
88500	94500	Further back, paintings and texts become our main way of experiencing the past.
94500	99500	A mere 20 generations before us today, every written word had to be copied by hand,
99500	103500	and reports became more scarce and less reliable.
103500	108000	The first historian lived a mere 100 generations ago.
108000	115000	For him, there are only epics and legends and dead kings bragging on pieces of stone.
115000	123500	250 generations ago, there are only fragments left in the ground and images stripped of their original meaning.
123500	127500	Eventually, humanity becomes basically invisible.
127500	131000	Still, we do know some things about our ancestors.
131000	136000	Let's try to tell their story and what it means for us today.
136000	139500	The greatest transition in human history.
139500	146500	For some 2 million years or roughly 80,000 generations, the life of our ancestors was basically the same.
146500	153000	It was around 20,000 years or 800 generations ago that the behaviorally modern humans began a process
153000	156000	that would change our lifestyle forever.
156000	158500	At first, gradually, for some of us.
158500	161000	Then faster, for more of us.
161000	164500	And then, suddenly, for almost all of us.
164500	168500	Back then, there were about 1 million modern humans on Earth.
168500	173000	Most other human species had died out, probably with a little help from us.
173000	177000	Our ancestors' biology had given them the necessary tools.
177000	182500	A general intelligence to understand things, a social intelligence to understand each other,
182500	187500	and language to express abstract ideas and create new concepts.
187500	190500	These were people just like you.
190500	196000	They suffered and experienced joy, were bored, cried, and laughed.
196000	199000	They lived in communities of a few dozen people.
199000	204000	They controlled fire and had tools made from wood, stone, and bone,
204000	208500	told stories, mourned their dead, and created art.
208500	213500	They traded with other tribes, from obsidian to shellfish.
213500	216500	Some hunted big game and were very mobile,
216500	219000	others relied more on plants they collected,
219000	223500	and others mostly stayed in one area with an abundance of seafood.
223500	227500	This was the common state of humanity for most of our history.
227500	234500	Until a slow transition, step by step, turned into a revolution.
234500	237500	Step by step.
237500	241500	The first solid evidence for this stems from the Jordan Valley,
241500	245500	where our ancestors collected wild wheat more than 20,000 years ago.
245500	249500	They noticed that seeds in the ground made more plants the next year.
249500	254500	If they put good ones in one place, the next year they had more of the good ones.
254500	257500	This was a great supplement to hunting and gathering.
257500	260500	You could prepare some crops, return next year,
260500	264500	build a temporary settlement, and have a secure food supply.
264500	270000	Our ancestors used these bonus crops to bake the first bread and brew the first beer.
270000	275000	With every generation, they gathered deeper knowledge about the plants and animals around them
275000	278000	and how to manipulate them to their advantage.
278000	280000	But there was a lot to learn.
280000	283000	Very slowly, from generation to generation,
283000	287500	pockets of knowledge expanded and were passed along to be expanded again.
287500	294000	This early agriculture started to drastically reduce the space our ancestors needed to feed one individual,
294000	297500	which made it possible to stay in one place longer.
297500	303000	Around 12,000 years ago, these little pieces of progress had reached a critical mass.
303000	308000	Most of the calories we consume today stem from about 15 different founder crops
308000	312500	that humans began to domesticate in earnest in the next few thousand years.
312500	317500	What we call the agricultural revolution was not a thing that began suddenly one day.
317500	322500	It was a slow process driven by small groups over many generations.
322500	327000	Eventually, gradual change gave rise to a new era.
328000	331000	The human era.
331000	334500	During the next few thousand years, progress would speed up
334500	340000	and turn hunter-gatherers into farmers who lived in villages, towns, and then cities.
340000	346500	When farmers moved into new areas, they replaced the nomadic tribes or turned them into farmers too.
346500	349500	This was neither easy nor painless.
349500	356000	In the early days, people had a diverse diet made up of up to 250 different plants and animals.
356000	361500	For some of the groups transitioning to agriculture, the variation in their diets declined drastically
361500	365000	and some even seemed to have been undernourished.
365000	371000	And living close together and with animals created a breeding ground for disease.
371000	376000	Virtually every infectious disease caused by microorganisms that have adapted to humans
376000	378500	arose in the last 10,000 years.
378500	383500	Cholera, smallpox, measles, influenza, chickenpox, and malaria.
384000	388000	Mortality, especially among children, rose drastically.
388000	394000	Still, our numbers grew because living in the same place enabled women to bear far more children than before
394000	399000	and for a farmer, more kids mean more hands to work the fields.
399000	403000	Even with more people dying younger, villages and towns grew.
403000	406500	The number of humans on Earth exploded.
406500	413000	About 100 generations after the beginning of the human era, there were already 4 million of us.
413000	419500	This increased the need for food and forced people to come up with ever more efficient ways of producing calories,
419500	422500	solidifying our new lifestyle.
422500	427500	Going back to hunting and gathering would have just meant death by starvation for most.
427500	431500	One question remains unanswered. Why?
431500	436500	Why would people exchange the freedom of living off nature with a huge variety in food
436500	440500	for the grind of agriculture and often more limited diets?
440500	442500	Nobody knows for sure.
442500	445500	Climate change seems to have made the transition possible
445500	451500	and some scientists argue that it was caused by external factors like undernourishment or overpopulation,
451500	454000	both highly contested.
454000	458500	Today, the most widely accepted idea is that it was a deliberate choice,
458500	462000	made by countless communities around the globe.
462000	465500	Maybe it's also connected with what makes us human,
465500	472000	the ability to come together, develop shared identities, and exchange stories and knowledge.
472000	477000	Some archaeologists think that groups of hunter-gatherers traveled long and far to celebrate,
477000	479500	to hold feasts and rituals.
479500	483500	They would have used these occasions to talk about their version of innovation,
483500	486000	better hunting and tool-making techniques,
486000	490500	how to catch and breed animals, and which plants could be collected and multiplied.
490500	493500	Maybe they even exchanged seeds.
493500	498000	It's not unlikely that these gatherings were the catalysts that spread the knowledge of agriculture
498000	501000	through the many isolated groups of humanity.
501000	506500	Ultimately ending a lifestyle that was common to our species for thousands of generations.
506500	511500	So by being able to come together, celebrate, share, and learn from one another,
511500	515500	these humans might have taken the steps that led to our modern world,
515500	518500	and we have much to be grateful for.
518500	524000	We are still the same humans today, even if it often doesn't feel that way.
524000	529500	Maybe it's time to come together to share what we know and celebrate our existence once again,
529500	532000	to begin another peaceful transition.
532000	536500	Maybe the planetary revolution that will change everything once more.
536500	544000	So, hopefully, in another 12,000 years, our descendants will look back on us today with gratitude
544000	549000	for the amazing world they are able to inhabit.
549000	553000	To celebrate the achievements of our ancestors in the last 12,000 years,
553000	555500	and to look with hope towards the next 12,000,
555500	561500	we present you with the fifth human-era calendar for the year 12,021.
561500	565500	This time, it's all about the journey of humanity.
565500	570500	Beginning tens of thousands of years ago, leading into the revolution of agriculture,
570500	575000	to ancient high civilizations, and the beginning of modern times,
575000	578000	culminating in a vision for our future.
578000	583000	You can get the limited edition now until we sell out, and then never again.
583000	589000	As always, the calendar features 12 illustrated pages printed on high-quality paper in Europe and the US.
589000	592500	And this year, the cover is especially shiny.
592500	598000	Not only does the calendar look great on walls and makes it easier to dream about a glorious future,
598000	604000	and realize how far we've come as a species, it's also the best way to support Kurzgesagt.
604000	610000	The calendar enables us to put in the time our videos need and release them for free for everyone.
610000	616500	If you want, you can get the calendar with a hoodie or infographic posters or plushie, we've made a few deals for you.
616500	620500	Thank you so much to the thousands of people who get the calendar every year,
620500	625000	and to the burbs who love what we try to do on this channel.
625000	633000	We wish you a happy year 12,021, and let's all hope that it will be less exciting than 12,020.
640000	642000	Thank you for watching.
