1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,500
Imagine someone coming into your kitchen and taking a few tools, a pan, and your garbage.

2
00:00:05,500 --> 00:00:08,000
Then they bury everything in the woods.

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:13,000
12,000 years later, an archaeologist is trying to figure out who you were,

4
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:19,500
what was important to you, what video games you played, what you believed in, and what informed your decisions.

5
00:00:19,500 --> 00:00:24,500
Because you happened to live during a remarkable time in human history.

6
00:00:24,500 --> 00:00:31,500
The planetary revolution, when humanity transitioned, becoming a multi-planetary species.

7
00:00:31,500 --> 00:00:36,000
In that time, our numbers would explode by orders of magnitude,

8
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:41,000
our technology and standard of living would improve to levels previously thought impossible,

9
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:45,000
and our self-conception would change forever.

10
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:50,500
And all the future archaeologist has to learn about is your junk in the woods.

11
00:00:50,500 --> 00:00:58,000
While we can only hope that this will be someone's problem in 12,000 years, we have the same problem today.

12
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:03,000
We're trying to reconstruct a revolution that took place 12,000 years ago.

13
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:10,500
Today, only shadows remain of the people who experienced our distant past as their present.

14
00:01:10,500 --> 00:01:14,500
What remains from our past?

15
00:01:14,500 --> 00:01:20,000
We can look at our present in crispy 4k in color and sound.

16
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:24,000
Three generations ago, the world was just black and white.

17
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:28,500
One more generation and we see the world through blurred photographs.

18
00:01:28,500 --> 00:01:34,500
Further back, paintings and texts become our main way of experiencing the past.

19
00:01:34,500 --> 00:01:39,500
A mere 20 generations before us today, every written word had to be copied by hand,

20
00:01:39,500 --> 00:01:43,500
and reports became more scarce and less reliable.

21
00:01:43,500 --> 00:01:48,000
The first historian lived a mere 100 generations ago.

22
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:55,000
For him, there are only epics and legends and dead kings bragging on pieces of stone.

23
00:01:55,000 --> 00:02:03,500
250 generations ago, there are only fragments left in the ground and images stripped of their original meaning.

24
00:02:03,500 --> 00:02:07,500
Eventually, humanity becomes basically invisible.

25
00:02:07,500 --> 00:02:11,000
Still, we do know some things about our ancestors.

26
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:16,000
Let's try to tell their story and what it means for us today.

27
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:19,500
The greatest transition in human history.

28
00:02:19,500 --> 00:02:26,500
For some 2 million years or roughly 80,000 generations, the life of our ancestors was basically the same.

29
00:02:26,500 --> 00:02:33,000
It was around 20,000 years or 800 generations ago that the behaviorally modern humans began a process

30
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:36,000
that would change our lifestyle forever.

31
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,500
At first, gradually, for some of us.

32
00:02:38,500 --> 00:02:41,000
Then faster, for more of us.

33
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:44,500
And then, suddenly, for almost all of us.

34
00:02:44,500 --> 00:02:48,500
Back then, there were about 1 million modern humans on Earth.

35
00:02:48,500 --> 00:02:53,000
Most other human species had died out, probably with a little help from us.

36
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:57,000
Our ancestors' biology had given them the necessary tools.

37
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:02,500
A general intelligence to understand things, a social intelligence to understand each other,

38
00:03:02,500 --> 00:03:07,500
and language to express abstract ideas and create new concepts.

39
00:03:07,500 --> 00:03:10,500
These were people just like you.

40
00:03:10,500 --> 00:03:16,000
They suffered and experienced joy, were bored, cried, and laughed.

41
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:19,000
They lived in communities of a few dozen people.

42
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:24,000
They controlled fire and had tools made from wood, stone, and bone,

43
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:28,500
told stories, mourned their dead, and created art.

44
00:03:28,500 --> 00:03:33,500
They traded with other tribes, from obsidian to shellfish.

45
00:03:33,500 --> 00:03:36,500
Some hunted big game and were very mobile,

46
00:03:36,500 --> 00:03:39,000
others relied more on plants they collected,

47
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:43,500
and others mostly stayed in one area with an abundance of seafood.

48
00:03:43,500 --> 00:03:47,500
This was the common state of humanity for most of our history.

49
00:03:47,500 --> 00:03:54,500
Until a slow transition, step by step, turned into a revolution.

50
00:03:54,500 --> 00:03:57,500
Step by step.

51
00:03:57,500 --> 00:04:01,500
The first solid evidence for this stems from the Jordan Valley,

52
00:04:01,500 --> 00:04:05,500
where our ancestors collected wild wheat more than 20,000 years ago.

53
00:04:05,500 --> 00:04:09,500
They noticed that seeds in the ground made more plants the next year.

54
00:04:09,500 --> 00:04:14,500
If they put good ones in one place, the next year they had more of the good ones.

55
00:04:14,500 --> 00:04:17,500
This was a great supplement to hunting and gathering.

56
00:04:17,500 --> 00:04:20,500
You could prepare some crops, return next year,

57
00:04:20,500 --> 00:04:24,500
build a temporary settlement, and have a secure food supply.

58
00:04:24,500 --> 00:04:30,000
Our ancestors used these bonus crops to bake the first bread and brew the first beer.

59
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:35,000
With every generation, they gathered deeper knowledge about the plants and animals around them

60
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:38,000
and how to manipulate them to their advantage.

61
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,000
But there was a lot to learn.

62
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:43,000
Very slowly, from generation to generation,

63
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:47,500
pockets of knowledge expanded and were passed along to be expanded again.

64
00:04:47,500 --> 00:04:54,000
This early agriculture started to drastically reduce the space our ancestors needed to feed one individual,

65
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:57,500
which made it possible to stay in one place longer.

66
00:04:57,500 --> 00:05:03,000
Around 12,000 years ago, these little pieces of progress had reached a critical mass.

67
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:08,000
Most of the calories we consume today stem from about 15 different founder crops

68
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:12,500
that humans began to domesticate in earnest in the next few thousand years.

69
00:05:12,500 --> 00:05:17,500
What we call the agricultural revolution was not a thing that began suddenly one day.

70
00:05:17,500 --> 00:05:22,500
It was a slow process driven by small groups over many generations.

71
00:05:22,500 --> 00:05:27,000
Eventually, gradual change gave rise to a new era.

72
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:31,000
The human era.

73
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:34,500
During the next few thousand years, progress would speed up

74
00:05:34,500 --> 00:05:40,000
and turn hunter-gatherers into farmers who lived in villages, towns, and then cities.

75
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:46,500
When farmers moved into new areas, they replaced the nomadic tribes or turned them into farmers too.

76
00:05:46,500 --> 00:05:49,500
This was neither easy nor painless.

77
00:05:49,500 --> 00:05:56,000
In the early days, people had a diverse diet made up of up to 250 different plants and animals.

78
00:05:56,000 --> 00:06:01,500
For some of the groups transitioning to agriculture, the variation in their diets declined drastically

79
00:06:01,500 --> 00:06:05,000
and some even seemed to have been undernourished.

80
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:11,000
And living close together and with animals created a breeding ground for disease.

81
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:16,000
Virtually every infectious disease caused by microorganisms that have adapted to humans

82
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:18,500
arose in the last 10,000 years.

83
00:06:18,500 --> 00:06:23,500
Cholera, smallpox, measles, influenza, chickenpox, and malaria.

84
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:28,000
Mortality, especially among children, rose drastically.

85
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:34,000
Still, our numbers grew because living in the same place enabled women to bear far more children than before

86
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:39,000
and for a farmer, more kids mean more hands to work the fields.

87
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:43,000
Even with more people dying younger, villages and towns grew.

88
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:46,500
The number of humans on Earth exploded.

89
00:06:46,500 --> 00:06:53,000
About 100 generations after the beginning of the human era, there were already 4 million of us.

90
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:59,500
This increased the need for food and forced people to come up with ever more efficient ways of producing calories,

91
00:06:59,500 --> 00:07:02,500
solidifying our new lifestyle.

92
00:07:02,500 --> 00:07:07,500
Going back to hunting and gathering would have just meant death by starvation for most.

93
00:07:07,500 --> 00:07:11,500
One question remains unanswered. Why?

94
00:07:11,500 --> 00:07:16,500
Why would people exchange the freedom of living off nature with a huge variety in food

95
00:07:16,500 --> 00:07:20,500
for the grind of agriculture and often more limited diets?

96
00:07:20,500 --> 00:07:22,500
Nobody knows for sure.

97
00:07:22,500 --> 00:07:25,500
Climate change seems to have made the transition possible

98
00:07:25,500 --> 00:07:31,500
and some scientists argue that it was caused by external factors like undernourishment or overpopulation,

99
00:07:31,500 --> 00:07:34,000
both highly contested.

100
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:38,500
Today, the most widely accepted idea is that it was a deliberate choice,

101
00:07:38,500 --> 00:07:42,000
made by countless communities around the globe.

102
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:45,500
Maybe it's also connected with what makes us human,

103
00:07:45,500 --> 00:07:52,000
the ability to come together, develop shared identities, and exchange stories and knowledge.

104
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:57,000
Some archaeologists think that groups of hunter-gatherers traveled long and far to celebrate,

105
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:59,500
to hold feasts and rituals.

106
00:07:59,500 --> 00:08:03,500
They would have used these occasions to talk about their version of innovation,

107
00:08:03,500 --> 00:08:06,000
better hunting and tool-making techniques,

108
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:10,500
how to catch and breed animals, and which plants could be collected and multiplied.

109
00:08:10,500 --> 00:08:13,500
Maybe they even exchanged seeds.

110
00:08:13,500 --> 00:08:18,000
It's not unlikely that these gatherings were the catalysts that spread the knowledge of agriculture

111
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:21,000
through the many isolated groups of humanity.

112
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:26,500
Ultimately ending a lifestyle that was common to our species for thousands of generations.

113
00:08:26,500 --> 00:08:31,500
So by being able to come together, celebrate, share, and learn from one another,

114
00:08:31,500 --> 00:08:35,500
these humans might have taken the steps that led to our modern world,

115
00:08:35,500 --> 00:08:38,500
and we have much to be grateful for.

116
00:08:38,500 --> 00:08:44,000
We are still the same humans today, even if it often doesn't feel that way.

117
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:49,500
Maybe it's time to come together to share what we know and celebrate our existence once again,

118
00:08:49,500 --> 00:08:52,000
to begin another peaceful transition.

119
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:56,500
Maybe the planetary revolution that will change everything once more.

120
00:08:56,500 --> 00:09:04,000
So, hopefully, in another 12,000 years, our descendants will look back on us today with gratitude

121
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:09,000
for the amazing world they are able to inhabit.

122
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:13,000
To celebrate the achievements of our ancestors in the last 12,000 years,

123
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:15,500
and to look with hope towards the next 12,000,

124
00:09:15,500 --> 00:09:21,500
we present you with the fifth human-era calendar for the year 12,021.

125
00:09:21,500 --> 00:09:25,500
This time, it's all about the journey of humanity.

126
00:09:25,500 --> 00:09:30,500
Beginning tens of thousands of years ago, leading into the revolution of agriculture,

127
00:09:30,500 --> 00:09:35,000
to ancient high civilizations, and the beginning of modern times,

128
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:38,000
culminating in a vision for our future.

129
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:43,000
You can get the limited edition now until we sell out, and then never again.

130
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:49,000
As always, the calendar features 12 illustrated pages printed on high-quality paper in Europe and the US.

131
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:52,500
And this year, the cover is especially shiny.

132
00:09:52,500 --> 00:09:58,000
Not only does the calendar look great on walls and makes it easier to dream about a glorious future,

133
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:04,000
and realize how far we've come as a species, it's also the best way to support Kurzgesagt.

134
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:10,000
The calendar enables us to put in the time our videos need and release them for free for everyone.

135
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:16,500
If you want, you can get the calendar with a hoodie or infographic posters or plushie, we've made a few deals for you.

136
00:10:16,500 --> 00:10:20,500
Thank you so much to the thousands of people who get the calendar every year,

137
00:10:20,500 --> 00:10:25,000
and to the burbs who love what we try to do on this channel.

138
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:33,000
We wish you a happy year 12,021, and let's all hope that it will be less exciting than 12,020.

139
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:42,000
Thank you for watching.
