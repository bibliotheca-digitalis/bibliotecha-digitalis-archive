00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,500
What if our universe comes with a self-destruct button to eliminate itself so cleanly and efficiently

2
00:00:06,500 --> 00:00:13,000
that every single physical thing would just stop existing and life would be impossible forever?

3
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:16,000
The ultimate ecological catastrophe

4
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:18,000
Vacuum Decay

5
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:32,000
To explain how our universe could destroy itself, we need to understand two principles.

6
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:36,000
One, energy levels.

7
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:40,000
A core idea in physics is that everything has an energy level.

8
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:45,000
The higher the level, the more energy is in the system, which for example has a high level.

9
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:51,000
It can be burned, a process that releases the chemical energy stored in its molecular bonds and turns it into heat.

10
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:56,000
The ash left over is at a lower energy level than the wood before.

11
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:00,000
Two, stability.

12
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:07,000
Everything in our universe tries to move towards its ground state, in which it's completely stable and has as little energy as possible.

13
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:12,000
For example, a ball on a hill is unstable and has a lot of potential energy.

14
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:17,000
When disturbed, it will roll down into the valley and lose its potential energy in the process.

15
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:22,000
The ball is now in its ground state and stable. It will remain like that.

16
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:26,000
Everything in our universe follows these two principles.

17
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:33,000
If something has a lot of energy, it's unstable and wants to get rid of it to become stable and reach its ground state.

18
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:39,000
This is true for every system, even in the weird world of quantum mechanics.

19
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:45,000
If our current understanding of physics is correct, then the universe gets its properties from quantum fields.

20
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:48,000
We explain them in detail in another video.

21
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:51,000
For this video, imagine them as the rules of the universe.

22
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:55,000
They tell particles how to behave and interact.

23
00:01:55,000 --> 00:02:02,000
Like everything in the universe, they want to be in the lowest energy level possible, which is called a vacuum state.

24
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:10,000
This has nothing to do with vacuum in space. It's just called this way because scientists are bad at naming things.

25
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:15,000
We think all the fields reached their vacuum state, except maybe one.

26
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:24,000
It's possible that the Higgs field is not stable, but metastable, which is a fancy way of saying that it pretends to be stable, but really is not.

27
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:27,000
It would be a false vacuum.

28
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:34,000
The Higgs field is responsible for giving particles their mass, which rules how almost everything in the universe interacts.

29
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:37,000
What would happen if the Higgs field is in a false vacuum?

30
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:42,000
Think of our ball in the valley. The ball is the Higgs field.

31
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:45,000
The valley might not be the lowest energy state for the Higgs field.

32
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:48,000
There might be an even deeper valley that it wants to get to.

33
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:53,000
This would mean that the Higgs field has a lot of potential energy waiting to be released.

34
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:59,000
The Higgs field could be like a piece of wood, but drenched in gasoline, waiting to set the universe on fire.

35
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:04,000
A random spark, like quantum tunneling, could release the potential energy of the Higgs field.

36
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:08,000
This could happen at any time and without warning.

37
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:14,000
If at any point in space this so-called vacuum decay starts, there is no turning back.

38
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:20,000
As the Higgs field crashes into the lower energy state, it releases a massive amount of potential energy.

39
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:26,000
This energy pushes the space around it over the barrier, which releases more potential energy.

40
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:33,000
A sphere of the new stable Higgs field, or true vacuum, grows at the speed of light in all directions.

41
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:38,000
Imagine it like setting a sea of gasoline the size of the universe on fire.

42
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:43,000
The sphere is surrounded by a shell of energy that devours everything it comes into contact with.

43
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:47,000
Whatever it touches is eliminated from existence.

44
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:52,000
The bubble will continue to grow forever, deleting the universe on its way.

45
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:57,000
There is no way to be warned, since it's so fast, but there's nothing we could do anyway.

46
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:03,000
Our destruction would be instant. In a fraction of a second, Earth would be gone.

47
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:06,000
But it actually gets worse.

48
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:11,000
If the energy level of the Higgs field changes, it changes all of physics.

49
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:18,000
In the true vacuum of the sphere, the standard model will be overthrown, superseded by different physics that we don't know.

50
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:24,000
How fundamental particles behave, how atoms hold together, how chemicals react.

51
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:32,000
Vacuum decay won't just destroy life, it will destroy chemistry itself, making life as we know it impossible.

52
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:37,000
We simply have no idea what it would be like inside. It might be a shadow of what it is now.

53
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:40,000
Or not. We don't know.

54
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:44,000
If vacuum decay happens, the outlook is indeed grim.

55
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:47,000
If you feel slightly worried now, don't be.

56
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:53,000
At this point, false vacuum is speculation based on our current understanding of particle physics, which might be wrong.

57
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:58,000
It's kind of like using a ruler to measure a continent.

58
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:03,000
Sure, you can do it, but you might be off by quite a bit at the end.

59
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:09,000
Right now, no one can say a vacuum decay is a thing that's real, or just a scary idea.

60
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:17,000
But even if one or multiple spheres of death have already started expanding, the universe is so big that they might not reach us for billions of years.

61
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:22,000
If they're far enough away, they might not ever be able to reach us because of the expansion of the universe.

62
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:26,000
The speed of light is not that fast on the scale of the universe.

63
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:33,000
So while vacuum decay is fascinatingly scary, right now there are other things we should be more afraid of.

64
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:38,000
In contrast to vacuum decay, we have the power to prepare for most of them.

65
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:48,000
Videos like this one take hundreds of hours to make, so support us on Patreon if you'd like to learn more about the destruction of everything.

66
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,000
It really helps us out.

67
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:58,000
We try to destroy the universe at least once every few months, so let us know in the comments if you have doomsday scenarios you would like us to cover.
