0	5000	If you had to choose right now, how long would you want to live?
5000	6000	80 years?
6000	7000	90?
7000	9000	120?
9000	10000	Longer?
10000	14000	And do you think you'll change your mind once you reach that age?
15000	19000	50,000 years ago, most humans died very young.
19000	24000	As we learned how to use the resources around us to treat ourselves, this got better and better.
25000	29000	Today, humans are living longer and healthier lives than ever before.
30000	32000	But this has an unforeseen consequence.
32000	37000	We spend an ever-increasing part of our lives being sick and in need of care.
37000	42000	Most of us will die in a hospital bed, which is depressing enough by itself,
42000	45000	but we also have to witness the same happening to our loved ones.
45000	49000	Except, maybe, we can stop this forever.
50000	53000	The most effective way to treat a disease is to prevent it.
53000	59000	It saves many more lives if you stop a million people from smoking than coming up with better chemotherapies.
60000	63000	So why not put a halt to the cause of all disease?
63000	65000	The process of aging.
65000	70000	In a nutshell, aging is caused by physics and not biology.
70000	72000	Think of cars.
72000	75000	Parts wear down from rubbing and grinding.
75000	79000	Metal rusts, filters get plugged, rubber cracks.
79000	84000	Our bodies are worn down by trillions of tiny physical processes.
84000	88000	Oxygen, radiation from the sun, our metabolism.
88000	94000	Our bodies have many mechanisms to repair this damage, but over time they become less effective.
94000	99000	So our bones and muscles weaken, our skin wrinkles, our immune system gets weaker.
99000	103000	We lose our memory and our senses diminish.
103000	106000	There's no such thing as dying of old age.
106000	109000	We all die because one of our important parts breaks.
109000	117000	The older we get, the more damaged and fragile we become until one or multiple diseases take over and kill us.
117000	123000	Unnoticed by most of us, longevity research has made some unprecedented advances in the last few years.
123000	129000	For the first time, we're starting to understand the mechanisms behind aging and how to manipulate them.
129000	136000	Aging is neither mystical nor inevitable, and we might be able to stop or delay it during your lifetime.
136000	141000	We'll discuss the science behind it and how scientists are trying to stop it in another video.
141000	145000	But first, if we could, should we end aging?
145000	148000	Is this a good idea?
148000	153000	The end of aging, or life extension, makes many people uncomfortable.
153000	157000	We're born, are young, become older, and then we die.
157000	160000	This has been the natural order for literally all of human history.
160000	163000	And getting old is a good thing, right?
163000	167000	We celebrate the idea of living long enough to experience old age.
167000	169000	We even call them the golden years.
169000	175000	But the reality is that everybody wants to become old, but nobody wants to be old.
175000	178000	Think of the Greek myth of Tithonus, for example.
178000	182000	Tithonus was the lover of the goddess Eos, and probably an amazing dude,
182000	187000	because she begged Zeus to grant him immortality so they could spend eternity together.
187000	191000	But she forgot to specifically ask for eternal youth.
191000	196000	Tithonus was granted eternal life, but he kept aging, unable to die.
196000	202000	After a few hundred years, he was reduced to the size of a grape, babbling on senselessly forever.
202000	207000	Thousands of years ago, humans already feared never-ending old age.
207000	210000	But ending aging does not mean getting weaker and weaker.
210000	213000	If you become too old, it's too late.
213000	217000	A 90-year-old who stopped aging would die anyway after a few years.
217000	220000	Too much damage has been done to his internal machinery.
220000	224000	There are already too many surfaces for disease to attack.
224000	231000	Instead, the concept of life extension promises to end diseases, and with them, the end of a fixed maximum age.
231000	234000	We don't know how much we could prolong our lives.
234000	239000	We might make every human healthy to the currently accepted maximum age of around 120.
239000	243000	Or we might stop biological aging and disease indefinitely.
243000	246000	Nobody knows at this point what's possible.
246000	250000	Okay, but even if we could achieve that, should we?
250000	254000	Well, life extension is really just another phrase for medicine.
254000	258000	All the doctors are doing is trying to prolong life and minimize suffering.
258000	263000	The vast majority of healthcare resources are spent on the consequences of aging.
263000	270000	Nearly half of your lifetime healthcare costs will be spent during your senior years, and another third during middle age.
270000	276000	We are actually already trying to prolong life with our current medicine, we're just doing it very inefficiently.
277000	286000	Trying to stop aging from happening is not less natural than transplanting a heart, treating cancer with chemotherapy, using antibiotics or vaccines.
286000	293000	Nothing humans do nowadays is purely natural anymore, and we enjoy the highest standard of living ever as a consequence of that.
293000	298000	What we're doing right now is waiting until it's too late and the machine is failing.
298000	305000	And then we use the vast majority of our resources trying to fix it as well as we can, while it breaks down even further.
305000	308000	But life extension still feels hubristic.
308000	314000	Most people assume that they will want to die once they reach a certain age, and this might still be true.
314000	318000	The idea of avoiding death entirely is off-putting for many.
318000	323000	The end of biological aging would not mean the end of death in any way.
323000	328000	It's more like a summer evening when you were a kid and your mum called you inside.
328000	333000	You just wanted to keep playing, have a little more fun during sunset before you went to sleep.
333000	338000	It's not about playing outside forever, just a little longer until we feel tired.
338000	347000	If you imagine a world without disease where you and your loved ones could live in good health for another 100 or 200 years, how would this change us?
347000	351000	Would we take better care of our planet if we knew we would be around longer?
351000	357000	If we could work for 150 years, how much time would we spend figuring out what we're good at?
357000	360000	How much more time would we spend learning?
360000	367000	Would the intense feeling of pressure and stress many of us are feeling right now go away or get worse?
367000	376000	So, asking again, if you could choose how long to live right now in good health and with your friends and family, what's your personal answer?
376000	380000	What would you like your future to look like?
380000	385000	But maybe you're still unconvinced. Some nagging feeling remains.
385000	393000	That is the reaper whispering into your brain. Watch my video to hear what he says and why you shouldn't listen.
393000	396000	Your eternal future may depend on it.
