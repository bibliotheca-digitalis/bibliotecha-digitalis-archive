1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
If you had to choose right now, how long would you want to live?

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:06,000
80 years?

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:07,000
90?

4
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:09,000
120?

5
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:10,000
Longer?

6
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:14,000
And do you think you'll change your mind once you reach that age?

7
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:19,000
50,000 years ago, most humans died very young.

8
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:24,000
As we learned how to use the resources around us to treat ourselves, this got better and better.

9
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:29,000
Today, humans are living longer and healthier lives than ever before.

10
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
But this has an unforeseen consequence.

11
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:37,000
We spend an ever-increasing part of our lives being sick and in need of care.

12
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:42,000
Most of us will die in a hospital bed, which is depressing enough by itself,

13
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:45,000
but we also have to witness the same happening to our loved ones.

14
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:49,000
Except, maybe, we can stop this forever.

15
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:53,000
The most effective way to treat a disease is to prevent it.

16
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:59,000
It saves many more lives if you stop a million people from smoking than coming up with better chemotherapies.

17
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:03,000
So why not put a halt to the cause of all disease?

18
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:05,000
The process of aging.

19
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:10,000
In a nutshell, aging is caused by physics and not biology.

20
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,000
Think of cars.

21
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:15,000
Parts wear down from rubbing and grinding.

22
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:19,000
Metal rusts, filters get plugged, rubber cracks.

23
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:24,000
Our bodies are worn down by trillions of tiny physical processes.

24
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:28,000
Oxygen, radiation from the sun, our metabolism.

25
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:34,000
Our bodies have many mechanisms to repair this damage, but over time they become less effective.

26
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:39,000
So our bones and muscles weaken, our skin wrinkles, our immune system gets weaker.

27
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:43,000
We lose our memory and our senses diminish.

28
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:46,000
There's no such thing as dying of old age.

29
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:49,000
We all die because one of our important parts breaks.

30
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:57,000
The older we get, the more damaged and fragile we become until one or multiple diseases take over and kill us.

31
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:03,000
Unnoticed by most of us, longevity research has made some unprecedented advances in the last few years.

32
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:09,000
For the first time, we're starting to understand the mechanisms behind aging and how to manipulate them.

33
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:16,000
Aging is neither mystical nor inevitable, and we might be able to stop or delay it during your lifetime.

34
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:21,000
We'll discuss the science behind it and how scientists are trying to stop it in another video.

35
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:25,000
But first, if we could, should we end aging?

36
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:28,000
Is this a good idea?

37
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:33,000
The end of aging, or life extension, makes many people uncomfortable.

38
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:37,000
We're born, are young, become older, and then we die.

39
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:40,000
This has been the natural order for literally all of human history.

40
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:43,000
And getting old is a good thing, right?

41
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:47,000
We celebrate the idea of living long enough to experience old age.

42
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:49,000
We even call them the golden years.

43
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:55,000
But the reality is that everybody wants to become old, but nobody wants to be old.

44
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:58,000
Think of the Greek myth of Tithonus, for example.

45
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:02,000
Tithonus was the lover of the goddess Eos, and probably an amazing dude,

46
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:07,000
because she begged Zeus to grant him immortality so they could spend eternity together.

47
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:11,000
But she forgot to specifically ask for eternal youth.

48
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:16,000
Tithonus was granted eternal life, but he kept aging, unable to die.

49
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:22,000
After a few hundred years, he was reduced to the size of a grape, babbling on senselessly forever.

50
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:27,000
Thousands of years ago, humans already feared never-ending old age.

51
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:30,000
But ending aging does not mean getting weaker and weaker.

52
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:33,000
If you become too old, it's too late.

53
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:37,000
A 90-year-old who stopped aging would die anyway after a few years.

54
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:40,000
Too much damage has been done to his internal machinery.

55
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:44,000
There are already too many surfaces for disease to attack.

56
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:51,000
Instead, the concept of life extension promises to end diseases, and with them, the end of a fixed maximum age.

57
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:54,000
We don't know how much we could prolong our lives.

58
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:59,000
We might make every human healthy to the currently accepted maximum age of around 120.

59
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:03,000
Or we might stop biological aging and disease indefinitely.

60
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:06,000
Nobody knows at this point what's possible.

61
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:10,000
Okay, but even if we could achieve that, should we?

62
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:14,000
Well, life extension is really just another phrase for medicine.

63
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:18,000
All the doctors are doing is trying to prolong life and minimize suffering.

64
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:23,000
The vast majority of healthcare resources are spent on the consequences of aging.

65
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:30,000
Nearly half of your lifetime healthcare costs will be spent during your senior years, and another third during middle age.

66
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:36,000
We are actually already trying to prolong life with our current medicine, we're just doing it very inefficiently.

67
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:46,000
Trying to stop aging from happening is not less natural than transplanting a heart, treating cancer with chemotherapy, using antibiotics or vaccines.

68
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:53,000
Nothing humans do nowadays is purely natural anymore, and we enjoy the highest standard of living ever as a consequence of that.

69
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:58,000
What we're doing right now is waiting until it's too late and the machine is failing.

70
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:05,000
And then we use the vast majority of our resources trying to fix it as well as we can, while it breaks down even further.

71
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:08,000
But life extension still feels hubristic.

72
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:14,000
Most people assume that they will want to die once they reach a certain age, and this might still be true.

73
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:18,000
The idea of avoiding death entirely is off-putting for many.

74
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:23,000
The end of biological aging would not mean the end of death in any way.

75
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:28,000
It's more like a summer evening when you were a kid and your mum called you inside.

76
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:33,000
You just wanted to keep playing, have a little more fun during sunset before you went to sleep.

77
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:38,000
It's not about playing outside forever, just a little longer until we feel tired.

78
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:47,000
If you imagine a world without disease where you and your loved ones could live in good health for another 100 or 200 years, how would this change us?

79
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:51,000
Would we take better care of our planet if we knew we would be around longer?

80
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:57,000
If we could work for 150 years, how much time would we spend figuring out what we're good at?

81
00:05:57,000 --> 00:06:00,000
How much more time would we spend learning?

82
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:07,000
Would the intense feeling of pressure and stress many of us are feeling right now go away or get worse?

83
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:16,000
So, asking again, if you could choose how long to live right now in good health and with your friends and family, what's your personal answer?

84
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:20,000
What would you like your future to look like?

85
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:25,000
But maybe you're still unconvinced. Some nagging feeling remains.

86
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:33,000
That is the reaper whispering into your brain. Watch my video to hear what he says and why you shouldn't listen.

87
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:36,000
Your eternal future may depend on it.
