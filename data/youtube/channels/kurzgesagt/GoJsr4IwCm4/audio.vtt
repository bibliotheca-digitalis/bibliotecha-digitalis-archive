00:00.000 --> 00:05.000
If you had to choose right now, how long would you want to live?

00:05.000 --> 00:06.000
80 years?

00:06.000 --> 00:07.000
90?

00:07.000 --> 00:09.000
120?

00:09.000 --> 00:10.000
Longer?

00:10.000 --> 00:14.000
And do you think you'll change your mind once you reach that age?

00:15.000 --> 00:19.000
50,000 years ago, most humans died very young.

00:19.000 --> 00:24.000
As we learned how to use the resources around us to treat ourselves, this got better and better.

00:25.000 --> 00:29.000
Today, humans are living longer and healthier lives than ever before.

00:30.000 --> 00:32.000
But this has an unforeseen consequence.

00:32.000 --> 00:37.000
We spend an ever-increasing part of our lives being sick and in need of care.

00:37.000 --> 00:42.000
Most of us will die in a hospital bed, which is depressing enough by itself,

00:42.000 --> 00:45.000
but we also have to witness the same happening to our loved ones.

00:45.000 --> 00:49.000
Except, maybe, we can stop this forever.

00:50.000 --> 00:53.000
The most effective way to treat a disease is to prevent it.

00:53.000 --> 00:59.000
It saves many more lives if you stop a million people from smoking than coming up with better chemotherapies.

01:00.000 --> 01:03.000
So why not put a halt to the cause of all disease?

01:03.000 --> 01:05.000
The process of aging.

01:05.000 --> 01:10.000
In a nutshell, aging is caused by physics and not biology.

01:10.000 --> 01:12.000
Think of cars.

01:12.000 --> 01:15.000
Parts wear down from rubbing and grinding.

01:15.000 --> 01:19.000
Metal rusts, filters get plugged, rubber cracks.

01:19.000 --> 01:24.000
Our bodies are worn down by trillions of tiny physical processes.

01:24.000 --> 01:28.000
Oxygen, radiation from the sun, our metabolism.

01:28.000 --> 01:34.000
Our bodies have many mechanisms to repair this damage, but over time they become less effective.

01:34.000 --> 01:39.000
So our bones and muscles weaken, our skin wrinkles, our immune system gets weaker.

01:39.000 --> 01:43.000
We lose our memory and our senses diminish.

01:43.000 --> 01:46.000
There's no such thing as dying of old age.

01:46.000 --> 01:49.000
We all die because one of our important parts breaks.

01:49.000 --> 01:57.000
The older we get, the more damaged and fragile we become until one or multiple diseases take over and kill us.

01:57.000 --> 02:03.000
Unnoticed by most of us, longevity research has made some unprecedented advances in the last few years.

02:03.000 --> 02:09.000
For the first time, we're starting to understand the mechanisms behind aging and how to manipulate them.

02:09.000 --> 02:16.000
Aging is neither mystical nor inevitable, and we might be able to stop or delay it during your lifetime.

02:16.000 --> 02:21.000
We'll discuss the science behind it and how scientists are trying to stop it in another video.

02:21.000 --> 02:25.000
But first, if we could, should we end aging?

02:25.000 --> 02:28.000
Is this a good idea?

02:28.000 --> 02:33.000
The end of aging, or life extension, makes many people uncomfortable.

02:33.000 --> 02:37.000
We're born, are young, become older, and then we die.

02:37.000 --> 02:40.000
This has been the natural order for literally all of human history.

02:40.000 --> 02:43.000
And getting old is a good thing, right?

02:43.000 --> 02:47.000
We celebrate the idea of living long enough to experience old age.

02:47.000 --> 02:49.000
We even call them the golden years.

02:49.000 --> 02:55.000
But the reality is that everybody wants to become old, but nobody wants to be old.

02:55.000 --> 02:58.000
Think of the Greek myth of Tithonus, for example.

02:58.000 --> 03:02.000
Tithonus was the lover of the goddess Eos, and probably an amazing dude,

03:02.000 --> 03:07.000
because she begged Zeus to grant him immortality so they could spend eternity together.

03:07.000 --> 03:11.000
But she forgot to specifically ask for eternal youth.

03:11.000 --> 03:16.000
Tithonus was granted eternal life, but he kept aging, unable to die.

03:16.000 --> 03:22.000
After a few hundred years, he was reduced to the size of a grape, babbling on senselessly forever.

03:22.000 --> 03:27.000
Thousands of years ago, humans already feared never-ending old age.

03:27.000 --> 03:30.000
But ending aging does not mean getting weaker and weaker.

03:30.000 --> 03:33.000
If you become too old, it's too late.

03:33.000 --> 03:37.000
A 90-year-old who stopped aging would die anyway after a few years.

03:37.000 --> 03:40.000
Too much damage has been done to his internal machinery.

03:40.000 --> 03:44.000
There are already too many surfaces for disease to attack.

03:44.000 --> 03:51.000
Instead, the concept of life extension promises to end diseases, and with them, the end of a fixed maximum age.

03:51.000 --> 03:54.000
We don't know how much we could prolong our lives.

03:54.000 --> 03:59.000
We might make every human healthy to the currently accepted maximum age of around 120.

03:59.000 --> 04:03.000
Or we might stop biological aging and disease indefinitely.

04:03.000 --> 04:06.000
Nobody knows at this point what's possible.

04:06.000 --> 04:10.000
Okay, but even if we could achieve that, should we?

04:10.000 --> 04:14.000
Well, life extension is really just another phrase for medicine.

04:14.000 --> 04:18.000
All the doctors are doing is trying to prolong life and minimize suffering.

04:18.000 --> 04:23.000
The vast majority of healthcare resources are spent on the consequences of aging.

04:23.000 --> 04:30.000
Nearly half of your lifetime healthcare costs will be spent during your senior years, and another third during middle age.

04:30.000 --> 04:36.000
We are actually already trying to prolong life with our current medicine, we're just doing it very inefficiently.

04:37.000 --> 04:46.000
Trying to stop aging from happening is not less natural than transplanting a heart, treating cancer with chemotherapy, using antibiotics or vaccines.

04:46.000 --> 04:53.000
Nothing humans do nowadays is purely natural anymore, and we enjoy the highest standard of living ever as a consequence of that.

04:53.000 --> 04:58.000
What we're doing right now is waiting until it's too late and the machine is failing.

04:58.000 --> 05:05.000
And then we use the vast majority of our resources trying to fix it as well as we can, while it breaks down even further.

05:05.000 --> 05:08.000
But life extension still feels hubristic.

05:08.000 --> 05:14.000
Most people assume that they will want to die once they reach a certain age, and this might still be true.

05:14.000 --> 05:18.000
The idea of avoiding death entirely is off-putting for many.

05:18.000 --> 05:23.000
The end of biological aging would not mean the end of death in any way.

05:23.000 --> 05:28.000
It's more like a summer evening when you were a kid and your mum called you inside.

05:28.000 --> 05:33.000
You just wanted to keep playing, have a little more fun during sunset before you went to sleep.

05:33.000 --> 05:38.000
It's not about playing outside forever, just a little longer until we feel tired.

05:38.000 --> 05:47.000
If you imagine a world without disease where you and your loved ones could live in good health for another 100 or 200 years, how would this change us?

05:47.000 --> 05:51.000
Would we take better care of our planet if we knew we would be around longer?

05:51.000 --> 05:57.000
If we could work for 150 years, how much time would we spend figuring out what we're good at?

05:57.000 --> 06:00.000
How much more time would we spend learning?

06:00.000 --> 06:07.000
Would the intense feeling of pressure and stress many of us are feeling right now go away or get worse?

06:07.000 --> 06:16.000
So, asking again, if you could choose how long to live right now in good health and with your friends and family, what's your personal answer?

06:16.000 --> 06:20.000
What would you like your future to look like?

06:20.000 --> 06:25.000
But maybe you're still unconvinced. Some nagging feeling remains.

06:25.000 --> 06:33.000
That is the reaper whispering into your brain. Watch my video to hear what he says and why you shouldn't listen.

06:33.000 --> 06:36.000
Your eternal future may depend on it.
