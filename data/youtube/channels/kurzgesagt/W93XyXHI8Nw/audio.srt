1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,700
At its height, the Roman Empire was home to about 30% of the world's population, and,

2
00:00:07,700 --> 00:00:13,240
in many ways, it was the pinnacle of human advancement. Its citizens enjoyed the benefits

3
00:00:13,240 --> 00:00:19,200
of central heating, concrete, double glazing, banking, international trade, and upward social

4
00:00:19,200 --> 00:00:25,240
mobility. Rome became the first city in history with 1 million inhabitants, and was a center

5
00:00:25,240 --> 00:00:32,080
of technological, legal, and economic progress. An empire impossible to topple, stable and

6
00:00:32,080 --> 00:00:39,840
rich and powerful. Until it wasn't anymore. First slowly, then suddenly, the most powerful

7
00:00:39,840 --> 00:00:47,080
civilization on earth collapsed. By civilization, we mean a complex society where labor is specialized

8
00:00:47,080 --> 00:00:53,120
and social classes emerge and which is ruled by institutions. Civilizations share a dominant

9
00:00:53,120 --> 00:00:58,560
mutual language and culture, and domesticate plants and animals to feed and sustain large

10
00:00:58,560 --> 00:01:05,320
cities, where they often construct impressive monuments. Civilization lets us become efficient

11
00:01:05,320 --> 00:01:11,320
on large scales, collect vast amounts of knowledge, and put human ingenuity and the natural resources

12
00:01:11,320 --> 00:01:17,200
of the world to work. Without civilization, most people would never have been born. Which

13
00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:23,240
makes it a bit concerning that collapse is the rule, not the exception. Virtually all

14
00:01:23,240 --> 00:01:31,640
civilizations end, on average, after 340 years. Collapse is rarely nice for individuals. Their

15
00:01:31,640 --> 00:01:37,800
shared cultural identity is shattered as institutions lose the power to organize people. Knowledge

16
00:01:37,800 --> 00:01:44,720
is lost, living standards fall, violence increases, and often the population declines. The civilization

17
00:01:44,760 --> 00:01:49,880
either completely disappears, is absorbed by stronger neighbors, or something new emerges,

18
00:01:49,880 --> 00:01:56,240
sometimes with more primitive technology than before. If this is how it's been over the ages,

19
00:01:56,240 --> 00:02:09,680
what about us today? Just as Europeans forgot how to build indoor plumbing and make cement,

20
00:02:09,720 --> 00:02:14,760
will we lose our industrial technology, and with that our greatest achievements,

21
00:02:14,760 --> 00:02:21,960
from $1 pizza to smartphones or laser eye surgery? Will all this go away too? Today,

22
00:02:21,960 --> 00:02:27,760
our cities stretch for thousands of square kilometers. We travel the skies. Our communication

23
00:02:27,760 --> 00:02:34,520
is instant. Industrial agriculture with engineered high-yield plants, efficient machinery, and high

24
00:02:34,520 --> 00:02:40,600
potency fertilizer feeds billions of people. Modern medicine gives us the longest lifespan

25
00:02:40,600 --> 00:02:47,000
we've ever had, while industrial technology gives us an unprecedented level of comfort and abundance,

26
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:53,000
even though we haven't yet learned to attain them without destroying our ecosphere. There

27
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:58,440
are arguably still different civilizations around today that compete and coexist with each other,

28
00:02:58,480 --> 00:03:04,680
but together they also form a singular global civilization. But this modern

29
00:03:04,680 --> 00:03:10,720
globalized civilization is even more vulnerable in some ways than past empires because we are

30
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:17,320
much more deeply interconnected. A collapse of the industrialized world literally means that

31
00:03:17,320 --> 00:03:22,940
the majority of people alive today would perish since without industrial agriculture we would no

32
00:03:22,940 --> 00:03:29,580
longer be able to feed them. And there's an even greater risk. What if a collapse was so deeply

33
00:03:29,580 --> 00:03:35,620
destructive that we were unable to reindustrialize again? What if it ruined our chances of enjoying

34
00:03:35,620 --> 00:03:42,660
a flourishing future as a multiplanetary species? A global civilizational collapse could be an

35
00:03:42,660 --> 00:03:47,700
existential catastrophe, something that ruins not just the lives of everyone alive today,

36
00:03:47,700 --> 00:03:52,780
but all the future generations that could have come into being. All the knowledge we might have

37
00:03:52,780 --> 00:03:58,180
discovered, the art we might have created, the joys we might have experienced, would be lost.

38
00:03:58,180 --> 00:04:06,500
So how likely is all of this? Let's start with some good news. While civilization collapses have

39
00:04:06,500 --> 00:04:12,580
happened regularly, none have ever derailed the course of global civilization. Rome collapsed,

40
00:04:12,580 --> 00:04:19,580
but the Aksumite Empire, or the Teotihuans, and of course the Byzantine Empire, carried on. What

41
00:04:19,580 --> 00:04:25,420
about sudden population crashes? So far, we've not seen a catastrophe that has killed much more

42
00:04:25,420 --> 00:04:32,500
than 10% of the global population. No pandemic, no natural disaster, no war. The last clear example

43
00:04:32,500 --> 00:04:37,580
of a rapid global population decrease was the Black Death, a pandemic of the bubonic plague in

44
00:04:37,580 --> 00:04:42,860
the 14th century that spread across the Middle East and Europe and killed a third of all Europeans

45
00:04:42,860 --> 00:04:48,580
and about one-tenth of the global population. If any event was going to cause the collapse of

46
00:04:48,580 --> 00:04:54,780
civilization, that should have been it. But even the Black Death demonstrates humanity's resilience

47
00:04:54,780 --> 00:05:00,420
more than its fragility. While the old societies were massively disrupted in the short term,

48
00:05:00,420 --> 00:05:06,460
the intense loss of human lives and suffering did little to negatively impact European economic

49
00:05:06,460 --> 00:05:11,860
and technological development in the long run. Population size recovered within two centuries,

50
00:05:11,860 --> 00:05:18,340
and just two centuries later, the Industrial Revolution began. History is full of incredible

51
00:05:18,340 --> 00:05:24,500
recoveries from horrible tragedies. Take the atomic bombing of Hiroshima during World War Two.

52
00:05:24,500 --> 00:05:31,820
140,000 people were killed and 90% of the city was at least partially incinerated or reduced

53
00:05:31,820 --> 00:05:37,680
to rubble. But against all odds, they made a remarkable recovery. Hiroshima's population

54
00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:43,940
recovered within a decade, and today, it's a thriving city of 1.2 million people. None of

55
00:05:43,940 --> 00:05:48,780
this made these horrible events any less horrible for those who lived through them. But for us as a

56
00:05:48,780 --> 00:05:56,380
species, these signs of resilience are good news. Why recovery is likely even in the worst case.

57
00:05:56,380 --> 00:06:03,500
One thing that's different from historic collapses is that humanity now has unprecedented destructive

58
00:06:03,500 --> 00:06:09,580
power. Today's nuclear arsenals are so powerful that all-out global war could cause a nuclear

59
00:06:09,580 --> 00:06:15,540
winter and billions of deaths. Our knowledge of our own biology and how to manipulate it

60
00:06:15,540 --> 00:06:20,580
is getting so advanced that it's becoming possible to engineer viruses as contagious

61
00:06:20,580 --> 00:06:26,840
as the coronavirus and as deadly as Ebola. Increasingly, the risk of global pandemics

62
00:06:26,840 --> 00:06:33,140
is much higher than in the past. So we may cause a collapse ourselves, and it might be much worse

63
00:06:33,140 --> 00:06:38,460
than the things nature has thrown at us so far. But if say 99% of the population died,

64
00:06:38,500 --> 00:06:44,980
would global civilization collapse forever? Could we recover from such a tragedy? We have

65
00:06:44,980 --> 00:06:51,060
some reasons to be optimistic. Let's start with food. There are 1 billion agricultural workers

66
00:06:51,060 --> 00:06:56,380
today, so even if the global population fell to just 80 million, it's virtually guaranteed

67
00:06:56,380 --> 00:07:01,060
that many survivors would know how to produce food. And we don't need to start at square one,

68
00:07:01,060 --> 00:07:07,060
because we could still use modern high-yield crops. Maize is 10 times bigger than its wild

69
00:07:07,100 --> 00:07:14,140
ancestor. Ancient tomatoes were the size of today's peas. After agriculture, the next step

70
00:07:14,140 --> 00:07:19,780
towards recovery would be rebuilding industrial capacity like power grids and automated

71
00:07:19,780 --> 00:07:26,140
manufacturing. A huge problem is that our economies of scale make it impossible to just pick up where

72
00:07:26,140 --> 00:07:31,660
we left off. Many of our high-tech industries are only functional because of huge demand and

73
00:07:31,700 --> 00:07:37,900
intensely interconnected supply chains across different continents. Even if our infrastructure

74
00:07:37,900 --> 00:07:43,060
were left unharmed, we would make huge steps backwards technologically. But then again,

75
00:07:43,060 --> 00:07:49,020
we are thinking in larger time frames. Industrialization originally happened 12,000

76
00:07:49,020 --> 00:07:54,340
years after the agricultural revolution. So if we need to start over after a massive collapse,

77
00:07:54,340 --> 00:08:00,540
it shouldn't be that hard to reindustrialize, at least on evolutionary time scales. There's

78
00:08:00,580 --> 00:08:06,060
a hitch though. The industrial revolution was fueled literally by burning easily accessible

79
00:08:06,060 --> 00:08:12,420
coal, and we are still very much reliant on it. If we use it all up today, aside from making rapid

80
00:08:12,420 --> 00:08:17,820
climate change much worse, we could hinder our ability to recover from a huge crisis. So we

81
00:08:17,820 --> 00:08:23,340
should stop using easy-to-access coal, so it can serve as a civilization insurance in case

82
00:08:23,340 --> 00:08:29,220
something bad happens. Another thing that makes recovery likely is that we probably have most of

83
00:08:29,220 --> 00:08:33,980
the information we need to rebuild civilization. We would certainly lose a lot of crucial

84
00:08:33,980 --> 00:08:39,180
institutional knowledge, especially on hard drives that nobody could read or operate anymore. But a

85
00:08:39,180 --> 00:08:43,660
lot of the technological, scientific, and cultural knowledge stored in the world's 2.6 million

86
00:08:43,660 --> 00:08:48,900
libraries would survive the catastrophe. The post-collapse survivors would know what used

87
00:08:48,900 --> 00:08:53,340
to be possible, and they could reverse engineer some of the tools and machines they'd find.

88
00:08:53,340 --> 00:08:59,660
In conclusion, despite the bleak prospect of catastrophic threats, natural or created by

89
00:08:59,660 --> 00:09:06,460
ourselves, there is reason for optimism. Humankind is remarkably resilient, and even in the case of

90
00:09:06,460 --> 00:09:12,260
a global civilizational collapse, it seems likely that we would be able to recover. Even if many

91
00:09:12,260 --> 00:09:18,380
people were to perish or suffer immense hardship. Even if we lost cultural and technological

92
00:09:18,380 --> 00:09:24,180
achievements in the process. But given the stakes, the risks are still unnervingly high.

93
00:09:24,180 --> 00:09:30,500
Nuclear war and dangerous pandemics threaten the amazing global civilization we have built.

94
00:09:30,500 --> 00:09:37,500
Humanity is like a teenager, speeding around blind corners, drunk without a seatbelt. The

95
00:09:37,500 --> 00:09:43,260
good news is that it's still early enough to prepare for and to mitigate these risks. We just

96
00:09:43,260 --> 00:09:48,980
need to actually do it. We made this video together with Will MacAskill, a professor of

97
00:09:48,980 --> 00:09:54,380
philosophy at Oxford and one of the founders of the effective altruism movement, which is about

98
00:09:54,380 --> 00:09:59,180
doing the most good you can with your time and money. Will just published a new book called

99
00:09:59,180 --> 00:10:04,700
What We Owe the Future, which is about how you can positively impact the long-term future of our

100
00:10:04,700 --> 00:10:11,180
world. If you like Kurzgesagt videos, the chances are high you'll like it. The book has some pretty

101
00:10:11,220 --> 00:10:16,780
counterintuitive arguments, like that risks from new technologies such as AI and synthetic biology

102
00:10:16,780 --> 00:10:21,660
are at least as grave as those from climate change. Or that the world doesn't contain too

103
00:10:21,660 --> 00:10:27,860
many people, but too few. And especially that everyday actions like recycling or refusing to

104
00:10:27,860 --> 00:10:33,660
fly just aren't that big a deal compared to where you donate or what career you pursue. Most

105
00:10:33,660 --> 00:10:40,020
importantly, it argues that by acting wisely, you can help make tomorrow better than today. And how

106
00:10:40,020 --> 00:10:45,220
we together can build a flourishing world for the thousands or millions of generations that will

107
00:10:45,220 --> 00:10:51,180
come after us. Many things we at Kurzgesagt talk about regularly are discussed here in much greater

108
00:10:51,180 --> 00:10:59,740
detail. Check out What We Owe the Future wherever you get your books or audio books. Did we manage

109
00:10:59,740 --> 00:11:06,340
to unlock a new fear for you? Let's counter existential dread with appreciation for

110
00:11:06,340 --> 00:11:13,220
humanity. Look how far we've come as a species, what we've built and where we've gathered. Let

111
00:11:13,220 --> 00:11:17,500
this new world map poster be a reminder of what we can achieve.
