00:00.000 --> 00:07.700
At its height, the Roman Empire was home to about 30% of the world's population, and,

00:07.700 --> 00:13.240
in many ways, it was the pinnacle of human advancement. Its citizens enjoyed the benefits

00:13.240 --> 00:19.200
of central heating, concrete, double glazing, banking, international trade, and upward social

00:19.200 --> 00:25.240
mobility. Rome became the first city in history with 1 million inhabitants, and was a center

00:25.240 --> 00:32.080
of technological, legal, and economic progress. An empire impossible to topple, stable and

00:32.080 --> 00:39.840
rich and powerful. Until it wasn't anymore. First slowly, then suddenly, the most powerful

00:39.840 --> 00:47.080
civilization on earth collapsed. By civilization, we mean a complex society where labor is specialized

00:47.080 --> 00:53.120
and social classes emerge and which is ruled by institutions. Civilizations share a dominant

00:53.120 --> 00:58.560
mutual language and culture, and domesticate plants and animals to feed and sustain large

00:58.560 --> 01:05.320
cities, where they often construct impressive monuments. Civilization lets us become efficient

01:05.320 --> 01:11.320
on large scales, collect vast amounts of knowledge, and put human ingenuity and the natural resources

01:11.320 --> 01:17.200
of the world to work. Without civilization, most people would never have been born. Which

01:17.200 --> 01:23.240
makes it a bit concerning that collapse is the rule, not the exception. Virtually all

01:23.240 --> 01:31.640
civilizations end, on average, after 340 years. Collapse is rarely nice for individuals. Their

01:31.640 --> 01:37.800
shared cultural identity is shattered as institutions lose the power to organize people. Knowledge

01:37.800 --> 01:44.720
is lost, living standards fall, violence increases, and often the population declines. The civilization

01:44.760 --> 01:49.880
either completely disappears, is absorbed by stronger neighbors, or something new emerges,

01:49.880 --> 01:56.240
sometimes with more primitive technology than before. If this is how it's been over the ages,

01:56.240 --> 02:09.680
what about us today? Just as Europeans forgot how to build indoor plumbing and make cement,

02:09.720 --> 02:14.760
will we lose our industrial technology, and with that our greatest achievements,

02:14.760 --> 02:21.960
from $1 pizza to smartphones or laser eye surgery? Will all this go away too? Today,

02:21.960 --> 02:27.760
our cities stretch for thousands of square kilometers. We travel the skies. Our communication

02:27.760 --> 02:34.520
is instant. Industrial agriculture with engineered high-yield plants, efficient machinery, and high

02:34.520 --> 02:40.600
potency fertilizer feeds billions of people. Modern medicine gives us the longest lifespan

02:40.600 --> 02:47.000
we've ever had, while industrial technology gives us an unprecedented level of comfort and abundance,

02:47.000 --> 02:53.000
even though we haven't yet learned to attain them without destroying our ecosphere. There

02:53.000 --> 02:58.440
are arguably still different civilizations around today that compete and coexist with each other,

02:58.480 --> 03:04.680
but together they also form a singular global civilization. But this modern

03:04.680 --> 03:10.720
globalized civilization is even more vulnerable in some ways than past empires because we are

03:10.720 --> 03:17.320
much more deeply interconnected. A collapse of the industrialized world literally means that

03:17.320 --> 03:22.940
the majority of people alive today would perish since without industrial agriculture we would no

03:22.940 --> 03:29.580
longer be able to feed them. And there's an even greater risk. What if a collapse was so deeply

03:29.580 --> 03:35.620
destructive that we were unable to reindustrialize again? What if it ruined our chances of enjoying

03:35.620 --> 03:42.660
a flourishing future as a multiplanetary species? A global civilizational collapse could be an

03:42.660 --> 03:47.700
existential catastrophe, something that ruins not just the lives of everyone alive today,

03:47.700 --> 03:52.780
but all the future generations that could have come into being. All the knowledge we might have

03:52.780 --> 03:58.180
discovered, the art we might have created, the joys we might have experienced, would be lost.

03:58.180 --> 04:06.500
So how likely is all of this? Let's start with some good news. While civilization collapses have

04:06.500 --> 04:12.580
happened regularly, none have ever derailed the course of global civilization. Rome collapsed,

04:12.580 --> 04:19.580
but the Aksumite Empire, or the Teotihuans, and of course the Byzantine Empire, carried on. What

04:19.580 --> 04:25.420
about sudden population crashes? So far, we've not seen a catastrophe that has killed much more

04:25.420 --> 04:32.500
than 10% of the global population. No pandemic, no natural disaster, no war. The last clear example

04:32.500 --> 04:37.580
of a rapid global population decrease was the Black Death, a pandemic of the bubonic plague in

04:37.580 --> 04:42.860
the 14th century that spread across the Middle East and Europe and killed a third of all Europeans

04:42.860 --> 04:48.580
and about one-tenth of the global population. If any event was going to cause the collapse of

04:48.580 --> 04:54.780
civilization, that should have been it. But even the Black Death demonstrates humanity's resilience

04:54.780 --> 05:00.420
more than its fragility. While the old societies were massively disrupted in the short term,

05:00.420 --> 05:06.460
the intense loss of human lives and suffering did little to negatively impact European economic

05:06.460 --> 05:11.860
and technological development in the long run. Population size recovered within two centuries,

05:11.860 --> 05:18.340
and just two centuries later, the Industrial Revolution began. History is full of incredible

05:18.340 --> 05:24.500
recoveries from horrible tragedies. Take the atomic bombing of Hiroshima during World War Two.

05:24.500 --> 05:31.820
140,000 people were killed and 90% of the city was at least partially incinerated or reduced

05:31.820 --> 05:37.680
to rubble. But against all odds, they made a remarkable recovery. Hiroshima's population

05:37.680 --> 05:43.940
recovered within a decade, and today, it's a thriving city of 1.2 million people. None of

05:43.940 --> 05:48.780
this made these horrible events any less horrible for those who lived through them. But for us as a

05:48.780 --> 05:56.380
species, these signs of resilience are good news. Why recovery is likely even in the worst case.

05:56.380 --> 06:03.500
One thing that's different from historic collapses is that humanity now has unprecedented destructive

06:03.500 --> 06:09.580
power. Today's nuclear arsenals are so powerful that all-out global war could cause a nuclear

06:09.580 --> 06:15.540
winter and billions of deaths. Our knowledge of our own biology and how to manipulate it

06:15.540 --> 06:20.580
is getting so advanced that it's becoming possible to engineer viruses as contagious

06:20.580 --> 06:26.840
as the coronavirus and as deadly as Ebola. Increasingly, the risk of global pandemics

06:26.840 --> 06:33.140
is much higher than in the past. So we may cause a collapse ourselves, and it might be much worse

06:33.140 --> 06:38.460
than the things nature has thrown at us so far. But if say 99% of the population died,

06:38.500 --> 06:44.980
would global civilization collapse forever? Could we recover from such a tragedy? We have

06:44.980 --> 06:51.060
some reasons to be optimistic. Let's start with food. There are 1 billion agricultural workers

06:51.060 --> 06:56.380
today, so even if the global population fell to just 80 million, it's virtually guaranteed

06:56.380 --> 07:01.060
that many survivors would know how to produce food. And we don't need to start at square one,

07:01.060 --> 07:07.060
because we could still use modern high-yield crops. Maize is 10 times bigger than its wild

07:07.100 --> 07:14.140
ancestor. Ancient tomatoes were the size of today's peas. After agriculture, the next step

07:14.140 --> 07:19.780
towards recovery would be rebuilding industrial capacity like power grids and automated

07:19.780 --> 07:26.140
manufacturing. A huge problem is that our economies of scale make it impossible to just pick up where

07:26.140 --> 07:31.660
we left off. Many of our high-tech industries are only functional because of huge demand and

07:31.700 --> 07:37.900
intensely interconnected supply chains across different continents. Even if our infrastructure

07:37.900 --> 07:43.060
were left unharmed, we would make huge steps backwards technologically. But then again,

07:43.060 --> 07:49.020
we are thinking in larger time frames. Industrialization originally happened 12,000

07:49.020 --> 07:54.340
years after the agricultural revolution. So if we need to start over after a massive collapse,

07:54.340 --> 08:00.540
it shouldn't be that hard to reindustrialize, at least on evolutionary time scales. There's

08:00.580 --> 08:06.060
a hitch though. The industrial revolution was fueled literally by burning easily accessible

08:06.060 --> 08:12.420
coal, and we are still very much reliant on it. If we use it all up today, aside from making rapid

08:12.420 --> 08:17.820
climate change much worse, we could hinder our ability to recover from a huge crisis. So we

08:17.820 --> 08:23.340
should stop using easy-to-access coal, so it can serve as a civilization insurance in case

08:23.340 --> 08:29.220
something bad happens. Another thing that makes recovery likely is that we probably have most of

08:29.220 --> 08:33.980
the information we need to rebuild civilization. We would certainly lose a lot of crucial

08:33.980 --> 08:39.180
institutional knowledge, especially on hard drives that nobody could read or operate anymore. But a

08:39.180 --> 08:43.660
lot of the technological, scientific, and cultural knowledge stored in the world's 2.6 million

08:43.660 --> 08:48.900
libraries would survive the catastrophe. The post-collapse survivors would know what used

08:48.900 --> 08:53.340
to be possible, and they could reverse engineer some of the tools and machines they'd find.

08:53.340 --> 08:59.660
In conclusion, despite the bleak prospect of catastrophic threats, natural or created by

08:59.660 --> 09:06.460
ourselves, there is reason for optimism. Humankind is remarkably resilient, and even in the case of

09:06.460 --> 09:12.260
a global civilizational collapse, it seems likely that we would be able to recover. Even if many

09:12.260 --> 09:18.380
people were to perish or suffer immense hardship. Even if we lost cultural and technological

09:18.380 --> 09:24.180
achievements in the process. But given the stakes, the risks are still unnervingly high.

09:24.180 --> 09:30.500
Nuclear war and dangerous pandemics threaten the amazing global civilization we have built.

09:30.500 --> 09:37.500
Humanity is like a teenager, speeding around blind corners, drunk without a seatbelt. The

09:37.500 --> 09:43.260
good news is that it's still early enough to prepare for and to mitigate these risks. We just

09:43.260 --> 09:48.980
need to actually do it. We made this video together with Will MacAskill, a professor of

09:48.980 --> 09:54.380
philosophy at Oxford and one of the founders of the effective altruism movement, which is about

09:54.380 --> 09:59.180
doing the most good you can with your time and money. Will just published a new book called

09:59.180 --> 10:04.700
What We Owe the Future, which is about how you can positively impact the long-term future of our

10:04.700 --> 10:11.180
world. If you like Kurzgesagt videos, the chances are high you'll like it. The book has some pretty

10:11.220 --> 10:16.780
counterintuitive arguments, like that risks from new technologies such as AI and synthetic biology

10:16.780 --> 10:21.660
are at least as grave as those from climate change. Or that the world doesn't contain too

10:21.660 --> 10:27.860
many people, but too few. And especially that everyday actions like recycling or refusing to

10:27.860 --> 10:33.660
fly just aren't that big a deal compared to where you donate or what career you pursue. Most

10:33.660 --> 10:40.020
importantly, it argues that by acting wisely, you can help make tomorrow better than today. And how

10:40.020 --> 10:45.220
we together can build a flourishing world for the thousands or millions of generations that will

10:45.220 --> 10:51.180
come after us. Many things we at Kurzgesagt talk about regularly are discussed here in much greater

10:51.180 --> 10:59.740
detail. Check out What We Owe the Future wherever you get your books or audio books. Did we manage

10:59.740 --> 11:06.340
to unlock a new fear for you? Let's counter existential dread with appreciation for

11:06.340 --> 11:13.220
humanity. Look how far we've come as a species, what we've built and where we've gathered. Let

11:13.220 --> 11:17.500
this new world map poster be a reminder of what we can achieve.
