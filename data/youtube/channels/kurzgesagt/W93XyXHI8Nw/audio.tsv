0	7700	At its height, the Roman Empire was home to about 30% of the world's population, and,
7700	13240	in many ways, it was the pinnacle of human advancement. Its citizens enjoyed the benefits
13240	19200	of central heating, concrete, double glazing, banking, international trade, and upward social
19200	25240	mobility. Rome became the first city in history with 1 million inhabitants, and was a center
25240	32080	of technological, legal, and economic progress. An empire impossible to topple, stable and
32080	39840	rich and powerful. Until it wasn't anymore. First slowly, then suddenly, the most powerful
39840	47080	civilization on earth collapsed. By civilization, we mean a complex society where labor is specialized
47080	53120	and social classes emerge and which is ruled by institutions. Civilizations share a dominant
53120	58560	mutual language and culture, and domesticate plants and animals to feed and sustain large
58560	65320	cities, where they often construct impressive monuments. Civilization lets us become efficient
65320	71320	on large scales, collect vast amounts of knowledge, and put human ingenuity and the natural resources
71320	77200	of the world to work. Without civilization, most people would never have been born. Which
77200	83240	makes it a bit concerning that collapse is the rule, not the exception. Virtually all
83240	91640	civilizations end, on average, after 340 years. Collapse is rarely nice for individuals. Their
91640	97800	shared cultural identity is shattered as institutions lose the power to organize people. Knowledge
97800	104720	is lost, living standards fall, violence increases, and often the population declines. The civilization
104760	109880	either completely disappears, is absorbed by stronger neighbors, or something new emerges,
109880	116240	sometimes with more primitive technology than before. If this is how it's been over the ages,
116240	129680	what about us today? Just as Europeans forgot how to build indoor plumbing and make cement,
129720	134760	will we lose our industrial technology, and with that our greatest achievements,
134760	141960	from $1 pizza to smartphones or laser eye surgery? Will all this go away too? Today,
141960	147760	our cities stretch for thousands of square kilometers. We travel the skies. Our communication
147760	154520	is instant. Industrial agriculture with engineered high-yield plants, efficient machinery, and high
154520	160600	potency fertilizer feeds billions of people. Modern medicine gives us the longest lifespan
160600	167000	we've ever had, while industrial technology gives us an unprecedented level of comfort and abundance,
167000	173000	even though we haven't yet learned to attain them without destroying our ecosphere. There
173000	178440	are arguably still different civilizations around today that compete and coexist with each other,
178480	184680	but together they also form a singular global civilization. But this modern
184680	190720	globalized civilization is even more vulnerable in some ways than past empires because we are
190720	197320	much more deeply interconnected. A collapse of the industrialized world literally means that
197320	202940	the majority of people alive today would perish since without industrial agriculture we would no
202940	209580	longer be able to feed them. And there's an even greater risk. What if a collapse was so deeply
209580	215620	destructive that we were unable to reindustrialize again? What if it ruined our chances of enjoying
215620	222660	a flourishing future as a multiplanetary species? A global civilizational collapse could be an
222660	227700	existential catastrophe, something that ruins not just the lives of everyone alive today,
227700	232780	but all the future generations that could have come into being. All the knowledge we might have
232780	238180	discovered, the art we might have created, the joys we might have experienced, would be lost.
238180	246500	So how likely is all of this? Let's start with some good news. While civilization collapses have
246500	252580	happened regularly, none have ever derailed the course of global civilization. Rome collapsed,
252580	259580	but the Aksumite Empire, or the Teotihuans, and of course the Byzantine Empire, carried on. What
259580	265420	about sudden population crashes? So far, we've not seen a catastrophe that has killed much more
265420	272500	than 10% of the global population. No pandemic, no natural disaster, no war. The last clear example
272500	277580	of a rapid global population decrease was the Black Death, a pandemic of the bubonic plague in
277580	282860	the 14th century that spread across the Middle East and Europe and killed a third of all Europeans
282860	288580	and about one-tenth of the global population. If any event was going to cause the collapse of
288580	294780	civilization, that should have been it. But even the Black Death demonstrates humanity's resilience
294780	300420	more than its fragility. While the old societies were massively disrupted in the short term,
300420	306460	the intense loss of human lives and suffering did little to negatively impact European economic
306460	311860	and technological development in the long run. Population size recovered within two centuries,
311860	318340	and just two centuries later, the Industrial Revolution began. History is full of incredible
318340	324500	recoveries from horrible tragedies. Take the atomic bombing of Hiroshima during World War Two.
324500	331820	140,000 people were killed and 90% of the city was at least partially incinerated or reduced
331820	337680	to rubble. But against all odds, they made a remarkable recovery. Hiroshima's population
337680	343940	recovered within a decade, and today, it's a thriving city of 1.2 million people. None of
343940	348780	this made these horrible events any less horrible for those who lived through them. But for us as a
348780	356380	species, these signs of resilience are good news. Why recovery is likely even in the worst case.
356380	363500	One thing that's different from historic collapses is that humanity now has unprecedented destructive
363500	369580	power. Today's nuclear arsenals are so powerful that all-out global war could cause a nuclear
369580	375540	winter and billions of deaths. Our knowledge of our own biology and how to manipulate it
375540	380580	is getting so advanced that it's becoming possible to engineer viruses as contagious
380580	386840	as the coronavirus and as deadly as Ebola. Increasingly, the risk of global pandemics
386840	393140	is much higher than in the past. So we may cause a collapse ourselves, and it might be much worse
393140	398460	than the things nature has thrown at us so far. But if say 99% of the population died,
398500	404980	would global civilization collapse forever? Could we recover from such a tragedy? We have
404980	411060	some reasons to be optimistic. Let's start with food. There are 1 billion agricultural workers
411060	416380	today, so even if the global population fell to just 80 million, it's virtually guaranteed
416380	421060	that many survivors would know how to produce food. And we don't need to start at square one,
421060	427060	because we could still use modern high-yield crops. Maize is 10 times bigger than its wild
427100	434140	ancestor. Ancient tomatoes were the size of today's peas. After agriculture, the next step
434140	439780	towards recovery would be rebuilding industrial capacity like power grids and automated
439780	446140	manufacturing. A huge problem is that our economies of scale make it impossible to just pick up where
446140	451660	we left off. Many of our high-tech industries are only functional because of huge demand and
451700	457900	intensely interconnected supply chains across different continents. Even if our infrastructure
457900	463060	were left unharmed, we would make huge steps backwards technologically. But then again,
463060	469020	we are thinking in larger time frames. Industrialization originally happened 12,000
469020	474340	years after the agricultural revolution. So if we need to start over after a massive collapse,
474340	480540	it shouldn't be that hard to reindustrialize, at least on evolutionary time scales. There's
480580	486060	a hitch though. The industrial revolution was fueled literally by burning easily accessible
486060	492420	coal, and we are still very much reliant on it. If we use it all up today, aside from making rapid
492420	497820	climate change much worse, we could hinder our ability to recover from a huge crisis. So we
497820	503340	should stop using easy-to-access coal, so it can serve as a civilization insurance in case
503340	509220	something bad happens. Another thing that makes recovery likely is that we probably have most of
509220	513980	the information we need to rebuild civilization. We would certainly lose a lot of crucial
513980	519180	institutional knowledge, especially on hard drives that nobody could read or operate anymore. But a
519180	523660	lot of the technological, scientific, and cultural knowledge stored in the world's 2.6 million
523660	528900	libraries would survive the catastrophe. The post-collapse survivors would know what used
528900	533340	to be possible, and they could reverse engineer some of the tools and machines they'd find.
533340	539660	In conclusion, despite the bleak prospect of catastrophic threats, natural or created by
539660	546460	ourselves, there is reason for optimism. Humankind is remarkably resilient, and even in the case of
546460	552260	a global civilizational collapse, it seems likely that we would be able to recover. Even if many
552260	558380	people were to perish or suffer immense hardship. Even if we lost cultural and technological
558380	564180	achievements in the process. But given the stakes, the risks are still unnervingly high.
564180	570500	Nuclear war and dangerous pandemics threaten the amazing global civilization we have built.
570500	577500	Humanity is like a teenager, speeding around blind corners, drunk without a seatbelt. The
577500	583260	good news is that it's still early enough to prepare for and to mitigate these risks. We just
583260	588980	need to actually do it. We made this video together with Will MacAskill, a professor of
588980	594380	philosophy at Oxford and one of the founders of the effective altruism movement, which is about
594380	599180	doing the most good you can with your time and money. Will just published a new book called
599180	604700	What We Owe the Future, which is about how you can positively impact the long-term future of our
604700	611180	world. If you like Kurzgesagt videos, the chances are high you'll like it. The book has some pretty
611220	616780	counterintuitive arguments, like that risks from new technologies such as AI and synthetic biology
616780	621660	are at least as grave as those from climate change. Or that the world doesn't contain too
621660	627860	many people, but too few. And especially that everyday actions like recycling or refusing to
627860	633660	fly just aren't that big a deal compared to where you donate or what career you pursue. Most
633660	640020	importantly, it argues that by acting wisely, you can help make tomorrow better than today. And how
640020	645220	we together can build a flourishing world for the thousands or millions of generations that will
645220	651180	come after us. Many things we at Kurzgesagt talk about regularly are discussed here in much greater
651180	659740	detail. Check out What We Owe the Future wherever you get your books or audio books. Did we manage
659740	666340	to unlock a new fear for you? Let's counter existential dread with appreciation for
666340	673220	humanity. Look how far we've come as a species, what we've built and where we've gathered. Let
673220	677500	this new world map poster be a reminder of what we can achieve.
