00:00.000 --> 00:09.000
A war has been raging for billions of years, killing trillions every single day, while we don't even notice.

00:09.000 --> 00:17.000
The war is fought by the single deadliest entity on our planet, the bacteriophage, or phage for short.

00:17.000 --> 00:34.000
A phage is a virus. Not quite alive, not quite dead. Also, they look as if someone made them up.

00:34.000 --> 00:40.000
Their head is an icosahedron, a sort of dice with 20 faces and 30 edges.

00:40.000 --> 00:48.000
It contains the genetic material of the virus and often sits on a long tail that has leg-like fibers.

00:48.000 --> 00:54.000
There are more phages on Earth than every other organism combined, including bacteria.

00:54.000 --> 00:58.000
And they are probably everywhere living things exist.

00:58.000 --> 01:04.000
Billions are on your hands, in your intestines, and your eyelids right now,

01:04.000 --> 01:09.000
which might make you nervous since phages are responsible for the majority of deaths on Earth.

01:09.000 --> 01:16.000
But you're lucky. While they do commit genocide for breakfast, they only kill bacteria.

01:16.000 --> 01:22.000
Up to 40% of all bacteria in the oceans are killed by them every single day.

01:22.000 --> 01:29.000
But phages also have major flaws. Like any other virus, phages need a host to survive and reproduce.

01:29.000 --> 01:34.000
They're not much more than genetic material in a hull, and they specialize.

01:34.000 --> 01:41.000
Usually, a phage has chosen one specific bacteria and maybe some of its very close relatives.

01:41.000 --> 01:43.000
These are its prey.

01:43.000 --> 01:50.000
Imagine a phage as like a cruise missile that only hunts and kills members of one very unlucky family.

01:50.000 --> 01:57.000
When a phage finds its victim, it connects its tail fibers with receptors and uses a sort of syringe to puncture the surface.

01:57.000 --> 02:03.000
In a weird motion, the phage squeezes its tail and injects its genetic information.

02:03.000 --> 02:10.000
Within minutes, the bacteria is taken over. It's now forced to manufacture all the parts of new phages.

02:10.000 --> 02:15.000
They only stop when the bacteria is filled up with brand new phages.

02:15.000 --> 02:21.000
In the final step, they produce endolysin, a powerful enzyme that punches a hole in the bacteria.

02:21.000 --> 02:27.000
The pressure is so high that the bacteria sort of vomits out all of its insides and dies.

02:27.000 --> 02:32.000
New phages are released and begin the cycle anew.

02:32.000 --> 02:40.000
In the last few years, bacteriophages have enjoyed the attention of the second deadliest beings on Earth, humans.

02:40.000 --> 02:47.000
Recently, we've started looking into injecting millions of them into our bodies, because we're sort of getting desperate.

02:47.000 --> 02:49.000
We screwed up.

02:49.000 --> 02:54.000
In the past, a single cut or a sip from the wrong puddle could kill you.

02:54.000 --> 02:59.000
Bacteria were our phages, tiny monsters that hunted us mercilessly.

02:59.000 --> 03:03.000
But then, about 100 years ago, we found a solution in nature.

03:03.000 --> 03:09.000
By accident, we found fungi that produced a compound that killed bacteria, antibiotics.

03:09.000 --> 03:13.000
Suddenly, we had a powerful super weapon.

03:13.000 --> 03:18.000
Antibiotics were so effective that we stopped thinking of bacteria as monsters.

03:18.000 --> 03:21.000
Only the old and weakest among us were killed by them.

03:21.000 --> 03:26.000
We used antibiotics more and more for less and less serious causes.

03:26.000 --> 03:30.000
We lost respect for the monsters and the weapon.

03:30.000 --> 03:37.000
But bacteria are living things that evolve, and one by one, they started to become immune against our weapons.

03:37.000 --> 03:45.000
This continued until we had created what are called superbugs, bacteria immune to almost everything we have.

03:45.000 --> 03:49.000
This immunity is spreading across the world as we speak.

03:49.000 --> 03:54.000
By 2050, superbugs could kill more humans a year than cancer.

03:55.000 --> 04:01.000
The days when a cut or bladder infection or a cough could kill you or your loved ones are coming back.

04:01.000 --> 04:08.000
In the US alone, more than 23,000 people die from resistant bacteria each year.

04:08.000 --> 04:14.000
But it turns out that phages, our tiny killer virus robots, could save us.

04:14.000 --> 04:18.000
We could inject them into our bodies to help cure infections.

04:18.000 --> 04:24.000
Hold on, how can injecting millions of viruses into an infection be a good idea?

04:24.000 --> 04:28.000
Phages are very, very specialized killers of bacteria.

04:28.000 --> 04:32.000
So specialized, in fact, that humans are completely immune to them.

04:32.000 --> 04:34.000
We are too different.

04:34.000 --> 04:40.000
We encounter billions of phages every day, and we just politely ignore each other.

04:40.000 --> 04:47.000
Antibiotics are like carpet bombing, killing everything, even the good bacteria in our intestines that we don't want to harm.

04:47.000 --> 04:53.000
Phages are like guided missiles that only attack what they're supposed to.

04:53.000 --> 05:00.000
Wait a minute, if we use phages to kill bacteria, won't bacteria develop ways of defending themselves?

05:00.000 --> 05:05.000
Well, it's more complex than that. Phages evolve too.

05:05.000 --> 05:12.000
There has been an arms race between them and bacteria for billions of years, and so far, they're doing great.

05:13.000 --> 05:19.000
This makes phages smart weapons that are constantly getting better at killing.

05:19.000 --> 05:25.000
But even if bacteria were to become immune against our phage, we still might be able to win.

05:25.000 --> 05:35.000
It turns out that in order to become resistant to even just a few species of phages, bacteria have to give up their resistance to antibiotics.

05:35.000 --> 05:39.000
We might be able to trap them in a catch-22.

05:39.000 --> 05:45.000
This has already been successfully tested with a patient who had no other hope left.

05:45.000 --> 05:52.000
The bacteria Pseudomonas aeruginosa, one of the most feared bacteria, infected the man's chest cavity.

05:52.000 --> 05:59.000
They are naturally resistant to most antibiotics, and can even survive in alcoholic hand gel.

05:59.000 --> 06:08.000
After years of suffering, a few thousand phages were directly inserted into his chest cavity, together with antibiotics the bacteria were immune to.

06:08.000 --> 06:13.000
After a few weeks, the infections had completely disappeared.

06:13.000 --> 06:23.000
Unfortunately, this treatment is still experimental, and pharma companies are still reluctant to invest the necessary billions in a treatment that has no official approval yet.

06:23.000 --> 06:26.000
But things are finally changing.

06:26.000 --> 06:33.000
In 2016, the largest phage clinical trial to date began, and phages are getting more and more attention.

06:34.000 --> 06:42.000
And we better get used to it, because the era in which antibiotics have been our super weapon is drawing to a close.

06:42.000 --> 06:53.000
It might be a weird concept, but injecting the deadliest being on planet Earth directly into our bodies could save millions of lives.

06:53.000 --> 06:57.000
