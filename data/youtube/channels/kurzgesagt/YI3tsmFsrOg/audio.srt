00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:09,000
A war has been raging for billions of years, killing trillions every single day, while we don't even notice.

2
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:17,000
The war is fought by the single deadliest entity on our planet, the bacteriophage, or phage for short.

3
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:34,000
A phage is a virus. Not quite alive, not quite dead. Also, they look as if someone made them up.

4
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:40,000
Their head is an icosahedron, a sort of dice with 20 faces and 30 edges.

5
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:48,000
It contains the genetic material of the virus and often sits on a long tail that has leg-like fibers.

6
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:54,000
There are more phages on Earth than every other organism combined, including bacteria.

7
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:58,000
And they are probably everywhere living things exist.

8
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:04,000
Billions are on your hands, in your intestines, and your eyelids right now,

9
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:09,000
which might make you nervous since phages are responsible for the majority of deaths on Earth.

10
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:16,000
But you're lucky. While they do commit genocide for breakfast, they only kill bacteria.

11
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:22,000
Up to 40% of all bacteria in the oceans are killed by them every single day.

12
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:29,000
But phages also have major flaws. Like any other virus, phages need a host to survive and reproduce.

13
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:34,000
They're not much more than genetic material in a hull, and they specialize.

14
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:41,000
Usually, a phage has chosen one specific bacteria and maybe some of its very close relatives.

15
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:43,000
These are its prey.

16
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:50,000
Imagine a phage as like a cruise missile that only hunts and kills members of one very unlucky family.

17
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:57,000
When a phage finds its victim, it connects its tail fibers with receptors and uses a sort of syringe to puncture the surface.

18
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:03,000
In a weird motion, the phage squeezes its tail and injects its genetic information.

19
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:10,000
Within minutes, the bacteria is taken over. It's now forced to manufacture all the parts of new phages.

20
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:15,000
They only stop when the bacteria is filled up with brand new phages.

21
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:21,000
In the final step, they produce endolysin, a powerful enzyme that punches a hole in the bacteria.

22
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:27,000
The pressure is so high that the bacteria sort of vomits out all of its insides and dies.

23
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:32,000
New phages are released and begin the cycle anew.

24
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:40,000
In the last few years, bacteriophages have enjoyed the attention of the second deadliest beings on Earth, humans.

25
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:47,000
Recently, we've started looking into injecting millions of them into our bodies, because we're sort of getting desperate.

26
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:49,000
We screwed up.

27
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:54,000
In the past, a single cut or a sip from the wrong puddle could kill you.

28
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:59,000
Bacteria were our phages, tiny monsters that hunted us mercilessly.

29
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:03,000
But then, about 100 years ago, we found a solution in nature.

30
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:09,000
By accident, we found fungi that produced a compound that killed bacteria, antibiotics.

31
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:13,000
Suddenly, we had a powerful super weapon.

32
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:18,000
Antibiotics were so effective that we stopped thinking of bacteria as monsters.

33
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:21,000
Only the old and weakest among us were killed by them.

34
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:26,000
We used antibiotics more and more for less and less serious causes.

35
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:30,000
We lost respect for the monsters and the weapon.

36
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:37,000
But bacteria are living things that evolve, and one by one, they started to become immune against our weapons.

37
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:45,000
This continued until we had created what are called superbugs, bacteria immune to almost everything we have.

38
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:49,000
This immunity is spreading across the world as we speak.

39
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:54,000
By 2050, superbugs could kill more humans a year than cancer.

40
00:03:55,000 --> 00:04:01,000
The days when a cut or bladder infection or a cough could kill you or your loved ones are coming back.

41
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:08,000
In the US alone, more than 23,000 people die from resistant bacteria each year.

42
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:14,000
But it turns out that phages, our tiny killer virus robots, could save us.

43
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:18,000
We could inject them into our bodies to help cure infections.

44
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:24,000
Hold on, how can injecting millions of viruses into an infection be a good idea?

45
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:28,000
Phages are very, very specialized killers of bacteria.

46
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:32,000
So specialized, in fact, that humans are completely immune to them.

47
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:34,000
We are too different.

48
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:40,000
We encounter billions of phages every day, and we just politely ignore each other.

49
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:47,000
Antibiotics are like carpet bombing, killing everything, even the good bacteria in our intestines that we don't want to harm.

50
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:53,000
Phages are like guided missiles that only attack what they're supposed to.

51
00:04:53,000 --> 00:05:00,000
Wait a minute, if we use phages to kill bacteria, won't bacteria develop ways of defending themselves?

52
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:05,000
Well, it's more complex than that. Phages evolve too.

53
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:12,000
There has been an arms race between them and bacteria for billions of years, and so far, they're doing great.

54
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:19,000
This makes phages smart weapons that are constantly getting better at killing.

55
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:25,000
But even if bacteria were to become immune against our phage, we still might be able to win.

56
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:35,000
It turns out that in order to become resistant to even just a few species of phages, bacteria have to give up their resistance to antibiotics.

57
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:39,000
We might be able to trap them in a catch-22.

58
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:45,000
This has already been successfully tested with a patient who had no other hope left.

59
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:52,000
The bacteria Pseudomonas aeruginosa, one of the most feared bacteria, infected the man's chest cavity.

60
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:59,000
They are naturally resistant to most antibiotics, and can even survive in alcoholic hand gel.

61
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:08,000
After years of suffering, a few thousand phages were directly inserted into his chest cavity, together with antibiotics the bacteria were immune to.

62
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:13,000
After a few weeks, the infections had completely disappeared.

63
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:23,000
Unfortunately, this treatment is still experimental, and pharma companies are still reluctant to invest the necessary billions in a treatment that has no official approval yet.

64
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:26,000
But things are finally changing.

65
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:33,000
In 2016, the largest phage clinical trial to date began, and phages are getting more and more attention.

66
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:42,000
And we better get used to it, because the era in which antibiotics have been our super weapon is drawing to a close.

67
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:53,000
It might be a weird concept, but injecting the deadliest being on planet Earth directly into our bodies could save millions of lives.
