0	9000	A war has been raging for billions of years, killing trillions every single day, while we don't even notice.
9000	17000	The war is fought by the single deadliest entity on our planet, the bacteriophage, or phage for short.
17000	34000	A phage is a virus. Not quite alive, not quite dead. Also, they look as if someone made them up.
34000	40000	Their head is an icosahedron, a sort of dice with 20 faces and 30 edges.
40000	48000	It contains the genetic material of the virus and often sits on a long tail that has leg-like fibers.
48000	54000	There are more phages on Earth than every other organism combined, including bacteria.
54000	58000	And they are probably everywhere living things exist.
58000	64000	Billions are on your hands, in your intestines, and your eyelids right now,
64000	69000	which might make you nervous since phages are responsible for the majority of deaths on Earth.
69000	76000	But you're lucky. While they do commit genocide for breakfast, they only kill bacteria.
76000	82000	Up to 40% of all bacteria in the oceans are killed by them every single day.
82000	89000	But phages also have major flaws. Like any other virus, phages need a host to survive and reproduce.
89000	94000	They're not much more than genetic material in a hull, and they specialize.
94000	101000	Usually, a phage has chosen one specific bacteria and maybe some of its very close relatives.
101000	103000	These are its prey.
103000	110000	Imagine a phage as like a cruise missile that only hunts and kills members of one very unlucky family.
110000	117000	When a phage finds its victim, it connects its tail fibers with receptors and uses a sort of syringe to puncture the surface.
117000	123000	In a weird motion, the phage squeezes its tail and injects its genetic information.
123000	130000	Within minutes, the bacteria is taken over. It's now forced to manufacture all the parts of new phages.
130000	135000	They only stop when the bacteria is filled up with brand new phages.
135000	141000	In the final step, they produce endolysin, a powerful enzyme that punches a hole in the bacteria.
141000	147000	The pressure is so high that the bacteria sort of vomits out all of its insides and dies.
147000	152000	New phages are released and begin the cycle anew.
152000	160000	In the last few years, bacteriophages have enjoyed the attention of the second deadliest beings on Earth, humans.
160000	167000	Recently, we've started looking into injecting millions of them into our bodies, because we're sort of getting desperate.
167000	169000	We screwed up.
169000	174000	In the past, a single cut or a sip from the wrong puddle could kill you.
174000	179000	Bacteria were our phages, tiny monsters that hunted us mercilessly.
179000	183000	But then, about 100 years ago, we found a solution in nature.
183000	189000	By accident, we found fungi that produced a compound that killed bacteria, antibiotics.
189000	193000	Suddenly, we had a powerful super weapon.
193000	198000	Antibiotics were so effective that we stopped thinking of bacteria as monsters.
198000	201000	Only the old and weakest among us were killed by them.
201000	206000	We used antibiotics more and more for less and less serious causes.
206000	210000	We lost respect for the monsters and the weapon.
210000	217000	But bacteria are living things that evolve, and one by one, they started to become immune against our weapons.
217000	225000	This continued until we had created what are called superbugs, bacteria immune to almost everything we have.
225000	229000	This immunity is spreading across the world as we speak.
229000	234000	By 2050, superbugs could kill more humans a year than cancer.
235000	241000	The days when a cut or bladder infection or a cough could kill you or your loved ones are coming back.
241000	248000	In the US alone, more than 23,000 people die from resistant bacteria each year.
248000	254000	But it turns out that phages, our tiny killer virus robots, could save us.
254000	258000	We could inject them into our bodies to help cure infections.
258000	264000	Hold on, how can injecting millions of viruses into an infection be a good idea?
264000	268000	Phages are very, very specialized killers of bacteria.
268000	272000	So specialized, in fact, that humans are completely immune to them.
272000	274000	We are too different.
274000	280000	We encounter billions of phages every day, and we just politely ignore each other.
280000	287000	Antibiotics are like carpet bombing, killing everything, even the good bacteria in our intestines that we don't want to harm.
287000	293000	Phages are like guided missiles that only attack what they're supposed to.
293000	300000	Wait a minute, if we use phages to kill bacteria, won't bacteria develop ways of defending themselves?
300000	305000	Well, it's more complex than that. Phages evolve too.
305000	312000	There has been an arms race between them and bacteria for billions of years, and so far, they're doing great.
313000	319000	This makes phages smart weapons that are constantly getting better at killing.
319000	325000	But even if bacteria were to become immune against our phage, we still might be able to win.
325000	335000	It turns out that in order to become resistant to even just a few species of phages, bacteria have to give up their resistance to antibiotics.
335000	339000	We might be able to trap them in a catch-22.
339000	345000	This has already been successfully tested with a patient who had no other hope left.
345000	352000	The bacteria Pseudomonas aeruginosa, one of the most feared bacteria, infected the man's chest cavity.
352000	359000	They are naturally resistant to most antibiotics, and can even survive in alcoholic hand gel.
359000	368000	After years of suffering, a few thousand phages were directly inserted into his chest cavity, together with antibiotics the bacteria were immune to.
368000	373000	After a few weeks, the infections had completely disappeared.
373000	383000	Unfortunately, this treatment is still experimental, and pharma companies are still reluctant to invest the necessary billions in a treatment that has no official approval yet.
383000	386000	But things are finally changing.
386000	393000	In 2016, the largest phage clinical trial to date began, and phages are getting more and more attention.
394000	402000	And we better get used to it, because the era in which antibiotics have been our super weapon is drawing to a close.
402000	413000	It might be a weird concept, but injecting the deadliest being on planet Earth directly into our bodies could save millions of lives.
