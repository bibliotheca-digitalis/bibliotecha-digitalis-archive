1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,160
The universe is magnificent and vast, hundreds of billions of galaxies, trillions of stars,

2
00:00:06,160 --> 00:00:12,160
and even more planets. If even the tiniest fraction are habitable, then the universe

3
00:00:12,160 --> 00:00:18,640
should be teeming with life, and yet we see nothing, only vast emptiness. Where is everyone

4
00:00:18,640 --> 00:00:26,560
else? The answer to this riddle could be as exciting as it is creepy. We are early,

5
00:00:26,560 --> 00:00:34,720
born before almost all other life. But very soon, this may change. Not only might aliens appear,

6
00:00:34,720 --> 00:00:40,640
they could quickly surround us. An irreversible competition for the universe might be about to

7
00:00:40,640 --> 00:00:55,600
begin. While this video is based on scientific papers, we're presenting interesting ideas based

8
00:00:55,600 --> 00:01:02,320
on little data and lots of extrapolation, so take them with a grain of salt. Okay, we need to look

9
00:01:02,320 --> 00:01:09,360
at three essential questions to understand the galactic competition. One, how fast can bacteria

10
00:01:09,360 --> 00:01:14,640
build spaceships? To become a star-faring civilization, life as we know it needs to

11
00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:20,880
master a number of very hard steps. It starts with dead stuff turning into the building blocks of

12
00:01:20,880 --> 00:01:27,680
life. Then it needs to organize into self-contained cells. Those cells have to learn to work together

13
00:01:27,680 --> 00:01:34,400
to form multicellular organisms. This keeps going until complex creatures with big brains learn to

14
00:01:34,400 --> 00:01:40,560
use tools and language. Civilization has to be formed from cultures that value progress

15
00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:46,160
and technological development, and then they need to actually venture out beyond their home planet.

16
00:01:46,160 --> 00:01:53,360
On Earth, life appeared basically as soon as the oceans formed. But then it took two billion years

17
00:01:53,360 --> 00:01:59,440
to make the step from single cells to multicellular organisms and two billion more for us to appear.

18
00:01:59,440 --> 00:02:07,280
Culture, civilization, and space travel developed super quickly though. Do things always take that

19
00:02:07,280 --> 00:02:14,080
long, or was this actually exceptionally fast? Also, passing one step does not mean the next one is

20
00:02:14,080 --> 00:02:21,040
guaranteed. Multicellularity evolved over 25 times independently on Earth, but there's only one

21
00:02:21,040 --> 00:02:27,280
species that builds spaceships. We don't know how many steps life needs to pass and how long they

22
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:32,880
take to give rise to a technological civilization, but there are probably many, and it's likely that

23
00:02:32,880 --> 00:02:39,600
on trillions of planets, life has been trying for billions of years. Since we don't see any other

24
00:02:39,600 --> 00:02:45,040
technological civilizations out there, it might well be that we are a rare exception. We might be

25
00:02:45,040 --> 00:02:52,080
among the first, or even the first technological civilization in the Milky Way. But this is just

26
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:57,200
one piece of the puzzle. On top of that, we may have just hit the perfect time window.

27
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:07,200
Why does humanity exist now? The universe is already 13.8 billion years old, but it's unlikely

28
00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:13,280
that many other technological civilizations had a chance to appear before us. Because in the earlier

29
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:18,720
universe, life would have had a pretty hard time to emerge, let alone thrive, because it was such

30
00:03:18,720 --> 00:03:25,360
a hostile environment. Early stars constantly blew up, galaxies crashed into each other, and

31
00:03:25,360 --> 00:03:31,760
supermassive black holes vomited massive amounts of radiation. Enough to sterilize galaxies over

32
00:03:31,760 --> 00:03:38,800
and over again. Our sun was born right at the end of this cosmic death show. The universe has never

33
00:03:38,800 --> 00:03:44,960
been more welcoming to life than it is now. So humanity has arrived at a very convenient spot in

34
00:03:44,960 --> 00:03:51,840
time, maybe the earliest reasonably possible for life to thrive. What about the future? The sun

35
00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:58,400
burns brighter than 90% of the stars in our galaxy, and will keep getting brighter. In about a billion

36
00:03:58,400 --> 00:04:03,040
years, it will boil all of Earth's oceans and then become a giant that swallows it whole.

37
00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:11,280
So in the galactic context, the sun is very short lived. Most stars are red dwarfs that can sustain

38
00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:18,000
habitable planets for tens of trillions of years. Life on these planets has an incredibly long time

39
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:24,800
window to appear and pass the hard steps. Even knowing nothing about how rare or common life is,

40
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:30,400
this makes it way more likely for technological civilizations to appear sometime in the future

41
00:04:30,400 --> 00:04:36,400
than in the past. Because if civilizations appear at random in the Milky Way within a time window

42
00:04:36,400 --> 00:04:43,760
of a trillion years, then very few, if any, would appear before today. Then a couple more arrive in

43
00:04:43,760 --> 00:04:48,960
this period of a billion years that we're in, before all starfaring civilizations that could

44
00:04:48,960 --> 00:04:55,760
ever exist emerge altogether. This weird tsunami like distribution is the result of both the hard

45
00:04:55,760 --> 00:05:02,320
steps model and something else. A sort of deadline for any spacefaring civilization.

46
00:05:02,960 --> 00:05:09,520
Any civilization coming after will find it hard to have room to survive. So all potential life

47
00:05:09,520 --> 00:05:16,400
has to cram in before it. Humanity exists now, because otherwise, we might have missed this

48
00:05:16,400 --> 00:05:24,320
deadline. What or who creates this deadline? Why aren't aliens already on Earth?

49
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:32,320
Humans are curious, expansionist, and hungry for energy. We've spread over the world and made it

50
00:05:32,320 --> 00:05:38,880
our own. Our technology has been improving over time, first slowly, then breathtakingly fast.

51
00:05:39,680 --> 00:05:44,400
If these things don't change drastically, and our descendants want to prosper,

52
00:05:44,400 --> 00:05:51,040
they will expand into space. We could construct a Dyson swarm for endless energy and transform

53
00:05:51,040 --> 00:05:57,200
planets into new homes. We could cross interstellar distances, allowing us to reach for planets around

54
00:05:57,200 --> 00:06:04,480
distant stars. If we have the motivation, we can become a galactic civilization. A civilization

55
00:06:04,480 --> 00:06:09,600
that does this sort of stuff can be called loud, because its activity creates noise,

56
00:06:10,320 --> 00:06:16,480
signs that can be detected from far away. Imagine someone in a forest, cutting down trees,

57
00:06:16,480 --> 00:06:22,960
starting fires, and laying down roads. The more intense their work, the easier they are to notice.

58
00:06:22,960 --> 00:06:28,400
An expanding technological civilization would probably be hard to miss. Our telescopes would

59
00:06:28,400 --> 00:06:33,600
pick up all that energy, and we would clearly identify artificial interference with stars and

60
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:39,200
planets. Another consequence of this business is that it's very disruptive to the environment.

61
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:45,920
Clearing a forest means the end of its wildlife. Human activity has left no chance for a squirrel

62
00:06:45,920 --> 00:06:51,200
civilization to appear. Not because we hated squirrels, it's simply that the thought that

63
00:06:51,200 --> 00:06:57,120
they might want to do that at some point never crossed our minds, and we needed word. Similarly,

64
00:06:57,120 --> 00:07:02,080
if loud civilizations were running around the galaxy in the past, terraforming planets or

65
00:07:02,080 --> 00:07:07,600
harvesting the energy of stars, they may have prevented our existence. Had aliens started

66
00:07:07,600 --> 00:07:11,920
colonizing Earth while we were still sludge in the oceans, that sludge would never have

67
00:07:11,920 --> 00:07:18,640
turned into humans. This is how loud aliens create a deadline for new civilizations appearing.

68
00:07:19,360 --> 00:07:24,400
The galaxy may have trillions of years to create life, but there may only be a short window for it

69
00:07:24,400 --> 00:07:30,640
to spread and thrive. Even if a loud civilization respects planets with naturally occurring life

70
00:07:30,640 --> 00:07:36,160
and expands around them, like humans do with wildlife reserves, any civilization on such a

71
00:07:36,160 --> 00:07:44,640
planet would not be able to expand ever, trapped forever on a tiny island. But here we are, so loud

72
00:07:44,640 --> 00:07:51,760
aliens were probably never here. What about aliens that don't expand? They would be quiet aliens.

73
00:07:52,400 --> 00:07:56,880
They're probably limited to one star system and don't have a noticeable impact on their

74
00:07:56,880 --> 00:08:02,880
cosmic surroundings. Humanity is like this right now, we wouldn't be able to detect ourselves from

75
00:08:02,880 --> 00:08:07,680
the other side of the Milky Way. If they stay quiet forever, maybe because of their culture

76
00:08:07,680 --> 00:08:14,400
or abilities, then they are not really a concern for us. We only have one sample to draw from

77
00:08:14,400 --> 00:08:21,440
humanity. And right now, we are on the path to becoming loud. If we're not special and succeed

78
00:08:21,440 --> 00:08:26,400
anyway, then any other civilization with the motivation and resources to would eventually

79
00:08:26,400 --> 00:08:32,480
expand beyond its planet of origin. Okay, what are the consequences of all these assumptions and

80
00:08:32,480 --> 00:08:41,440
ideas? Grave consequences, race to the stars. If we are really early, then eventually, others will

81
00:08:41,440 --> 00:08:47,280
catch up with us. Civilizations will emerge all over the place. And these new aliens will look at

82
00:08:47,280 --> 00:08:53,520
space, see no signs of life and come to the same conclusion. They exist because loud civilizations

83
00:08:53,520 --> 00:08:58,880
have not yet taken over everything. But it only takes one loud civilization to crowd them out of

84
00:08:58,880 --> 00:09:06,400
the entire galaxy. They like us will face an important decision. Do they stay quiet, take it

85
00:09:06,400 --> 00:09:11,760
easy and tend to their planet for as long as possible? Or do they start expanding to take a

86
00:09:11,760 --> 00:09:18,800
chunk of the galaxy before someone else arrives? mating others does not necessarily mean war or

87
00:09:18,800 --> 00:09:25,760
conflict. But it means that new borders will arise limits that may persist forever. In the worst case,

88
00:09:25,760 --> 00:09:31,200
a civilization could be completely enveloped by the empires of others, eternally doomed to be a

89
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:38,720
galactic backwater without control over their fate. So if we want to see to the galactic adults table,

90
00:09:38,720 --> 00:09:46,080
we best get to work. If we really are early, we have an incredible opportunity to mold thousands

91
00:09:46,080 --> 00:09:52,640
or even millions of planets according to our vision and dreams. And one day when we meet

92
00:09:52,640 --> 00:09:59,680
others, we can greet them and meet them as equals. Wouldn't that be nice? If you want to explore the
