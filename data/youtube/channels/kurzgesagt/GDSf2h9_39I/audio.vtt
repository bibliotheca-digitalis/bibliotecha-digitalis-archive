00:00.000 --> 00:06.160
The universe is magnificent and vast, hundreds of billions of galaxies, trillions of stars,

00:06.160 --> 00:12.160
and even more planets. If even the tiniest fraction are habitable, then the universe

00:12.160 --> 00:18.640
should be teeming with life, and yet we see nothing, only vast emptiness. Where is everyone

00:18.640 --> 00:26.560
else? The answer to this riddle could be as exciting as it is creepy. We are early,

00:26.560 --> 00:34.720
born before almost all other life. But very soon, this may change. Not only might aliens appear,

00:34.720 --> 00:40.640
they could quickly surround us. An irreversible competition for the universe might be about to

00:40.640 --> 00:55.600
begin. While this video is based on scientific papers, we're presenting interesting ideas based

00:55.600 --> 01:02.320
on little data and lots of extrapolation, so take them with a grain of salt. Okay, we need to look

01:02.320 --> 01:09.360
at three essential questions to understand the galactic competition. One, how fast can bacteria

01:09.360 --> 01:14.640
build spaceships? To become a star-faring civilization, life as we know it needs to

01:14.640 --> 01:20.880
master a number of very hard steps. It starts with dead stuff turning into the building blocks of

01:20.880 --> 01:27.680
life. Then it needs to organize into self-contained cells. Those cells have to learn to work together

01:27.680 --> 01:34.400
to form multicellular organisms. This keeps going until complex creatures with big brains learn to

01:34.400 --> 01:40.560
use tools and language. Civilization has to be formed from cultures that value progress

01:40.560 --> 01:46.160
and technological development, and then they need to actually venture out beyond their home planet.

01:46.160 --> 01:53.360
On Earth, life appeared basically as soon as the oceans formed. But then it took two billion years

01:53.360 --> 01:59.440
to make the step from single cells to multicellular organisms and two billion more for us to appear.

01:59.440 --> 02:07.280
Culture, civilization, and space travel developed super quickly though. Do things always take that

02:07.280 --> 02:14.080
long, or was this actually exceptionally fast? Also, passing one step does not mean the next one is

02:14.080 --> 02:21.040
guaranteed. Multicellularity evolved over 25 times independently on Earth, but there's only one

02:21.040 --> 02:27.280
species that builds spaceships. We don't know how many steps life needs to pass and how long they

02:27.280 --> 02:32.880
take to give rise to a technological civilization, but there are probably many, and it's likely that

02:32.880 --> 02:39.600
on trillions of planets, life has been trying for billions of years. Since we don't see any other

02:39.600 --> 02:45.040
technological civilizations out there, it might well be that we are a rare exception. We might be

02:45.040 --> 02:52.080
among the first, or even the first technological civilization in the Milky Way. But this is just

02:52.080 --> 02:57.200
one piece of the puzzle. On top of that, we may have just hit the perfect time window.

02:58.000 --> 03:07.200
Why does humanity exist now? The universe is already 13.8 billion years old, but it's unlikely

03:07.200 --> 03:13.280
that many other technological civilizations had a chance to appear before us. Because in the earlier

03:13.280 --> 03:18.720
universe, life would have had a pretty hard time to emerge, let alone thrive, because it was such

03:18.720 --> 03:25.360
a hostile environment. Early stars constantly blew up, galaxies crashed into each other, and

03:25.360 --> 03:31.760
supermassive black holes vomited massive amounts of radiation. Enough to sterilize galaxies over

03:31.760 --> 03:38.800
and over again. Our sun was born right at the end of this cosmic death show. The universe has never

03:38.800 --> 03:44.960
been more welcoming to life than it is now. So humanity has arrived at a very convenient spot in

03:44.960 --> 03:51.840
time, maybe the earliest reasonably possible for life to thrive. What about the future? The sun

03:51.840 --> 03:58.400
burns brighter than 90% of the stars in our galaxy, and will keep getting brighter. In about a billion

03:58.400 --> 04:03.040
years, it will boil all of Earth's oceans and then become a giant that swallows it whole.

04:03.840 --> 04:11.280
So in the galactic context, the sun is very short lived. Most stars are red dwarfs that can sustain

04:11.280 --> 04:18.000
habitable planets for tens of trillions of years. Life on these planets has an incredibly long time

04:18.000 --> 04:24.800
window to appear and pass the hard steps. Even knowing nothing about how rare or common life is,

04:24.800 --> 04:30.400
this makes it way more likely for technological civilizations to appear sometime in the future

04:30.400 --> 04:36.400
than in the past. Because if civilizations appear at random in the Milky Way within a time window

04:36.400 --> 04:43.760
of a trillion years, then very few, if any, would appear before today. Then a couple more arrive in

04:43.760 --> 04:48.960
this period of a billion years that we're in, before all starfaring civilizations that could

04:48.960 --> 04:55.760
ever exist emerge altogether. This weird tsunami like distribution is the result of both the hard

04:55.760 --> 05:02.320
steps model and something else. A sort of deadline for any spacefaring civilization.

05:02.960 --> 05:09.520
Any civilization coming after will find it hard to have room to survive. So all potential life

05:09.520 --> 05:16.400
has to cram in before it. Humanity exists now, because otherwise, we might have missed this

05:16.400 --> 05:24.320
deadline. What or who creates this deadline? Why aren't aliens already on Earth?

05:26.160 --> 05:32.320
Humans are curious, expansionist, and hungry for energy. We've spread over the world and made it

05:32.320 --> 05:38.880
our own. Our technology has been improving over time, first slowly, then breathtakingly fast.

05:39.680 --> 05:44.400
If these things don't change drastically, and our descendants want to prosper,

05:44.400 --> 05:51.040
they will expand into space. We could construct a Dyson swarm for endless energy and transform

05:51.040 --> 05:57.200
planets into new homes. We could cross interstellar distances, allowing us to reach for planets around

05:57.200 --> 06:04.480
distant stars. If we have the motivation, we can become a galactic civilization. A civilization

06:04.480 --> 06:09.600
that does this sort of stuff can be called loud, because its activity creates noise,

06:10.320 --> 06:16.480
signs that can be detected from far away. Imagine someone in a forest, cutting down trees,

06:16.480 --> 06:22.960
starting fires, and laying down roads. The more intense their work, the easier they are to notice.

06:22.960 --> 06:28.400
An expanding technological civilization would probably be hard to miss. Our telescopes would

06:28.400 --> 06:33.600
pick up all that energy, and we would clearly identify artificial interference with stars and

06:33.600 --> 06:39.200
planets. Another consequence of this business is that it's very disruptive to the environment.

06:40.000 --> 06:45.920
Clearing a forest means the end of its wildlife. Human activity has left no chance for a squirrel

06:45.920 --> 06:51.200
civilization to appear. Not because we hated squirrels, it's simply that the thought that

06:51.200 --> 06:57.120
they might want to do that at some point never crossed our minds, and we needed word. Similarly,

06:57.120 --> 07:02.080
if loud civilizations were running around the galaxy in the past, terraforming planets or

07:02.080 --> 07:07.600
harvesting the energy of stars, they may have prevented our existence. Had aliens started

07:07.600 --> 07:11.920
colonizing Earth while we were still sludge in the oceans, that sludge would never have

07:11.920 --> 07:18.640
turned into humans. This is how loud aliens create a deadline for new civilizations appearing.

07:19.360 --> 07:24.400
The galaxy may have trillions of years to create life, but there may only be a short window for it

07:24.400 --> 07:30.640
to spread and thrive. Even if a loud civilization respects planets with naturally occurring life

07:30.640 --> 07:36.160
and expands around them, like humans do with wildlife reserves, any civilization on such a

07:36.160 --> 07:44.640
planet would not be able to expand ever, trapped forever on a tiny island. But here we are, so loud

07:44.640 --> 07:51.760
aliens were probably never here. What about aliens that don't expand? They would be quiet aliens.

07:52.400 --> 07:56.880
They're probably limited to one star system and don't have a noticeable impact on their

07:56.880 --> 08:02.880
cosmic surroundings. Humanity is like this right now, we wouldn't be able to detect ourselves from

08:02.880 --> 08:07.680
the other side of the Milky Way. If they stay quiet forever, maybe because of their culture

08:07.680 --> 08:14.400
or abilities, then they are not really a concern for us. We only have one sample to draw from

08:14.400 --> 08:21.440
humanity. And right now, we are on the path to becoming loud. If we're not special and succeed

08:21.440 --> 08:26.400
anyway, then any other civilization with the motivation and resources to would eventually

08:26.400 --> 08:32.480
expand beyond its planet of origin. Okay, what are the consequences of all these assumptions and

08:32.480 --> 08:41.440
ideas? Grave consequences, race to the stars. If we are really early, then eventually, others will

08:41.440 --> 08:47.280
catch up with us. Civilizations will emerge all over the place. And these new aliens will look at

08:47.280 --> 08:53.520
space, see no signs of life and come to the same conclusion. They exist because loud civilizations

08:53.520 --> 08:58.880
have not yet taken over everything. But it only takes one loud civilization to crowd them out of

08:58.880 --> 09:06.400
the entire galaxy. They like us will face an important decision. Do they stay quiet, take it

09:06.400 --> 09:11.760
easy and tend to their planet for as long as possible? Or do they start expanding to take a

09:11.760 --> 09:18.800
chunk of the galaxy before someone else arrives? mating others does not necessarily mean war or

09:18.800 --> 09:25.760
conflict. But it means that new borders will arise limits that may persist forever. In the worst case,

09:25.760 --> 09:31.200
a civilization could be completely enveloped by the empires of others, eternally doomed to be a

09:31.200 --> 09:38.720
galactic backwater without control over their fate. So if we want to see to the galactic adults table,

09:38.720 --> 09:46.080
we best get to work. If we really are early, we have an incredible opportunity to mold thousands

09:46.080 --> 09:52.640
or even millions of planets according to our vision and dreams. And one day when we meet

09:52.640 --> 09:59.680
others, we can greet them and meet them as equals. Wouldn't that be nice? If you want to explore the
