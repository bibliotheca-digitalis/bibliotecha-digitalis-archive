0	4000	Everything changed when the Slaver Nation attacked.
4000	9000	What used to be a thriving colony is now a captured country.
9000	13000	Slaves do the work, serving their new masters until they die,
13000	17000	only to be replaced by new victims harvested in brutal raids.
17000	20000	But let's go back to the beginning.
20000	31000	The World War of the Ants is claiming millions of lives every day.
31000	36000	But in the brutal world of ants, straight-up war is not the only way.
36000	42000	Around 50 ant species practice slavery, the most extreme division of labor.
42000	48000	We don't know how this began, but some ant species perfected this cruel trade.
48000	53000	Meet Polyurgus, the most intense of the slaver ant tribes.
53000	57000	There are different species, but generally they're 4 to 10 millimeters long,
57000	61000	with brown to blackish bodies and sickle-shaped mandibles.
61000	67000	Polyurgus has specialized in slavery so much that they've lost their ability to care for themselves.
67000	71000	They don't clean, build nests, care for their brood, or feed themselves.
71000	74000	They only exist for raiding.
74000	78000	Slaves make up 80 to 90% of the ants in their colonies,
78000	83000	so a few hundred Polyurgus and a single queen control thousands of slave ants.
83000	89000	We'll summarize and simplify what we know about Polyurgus into one grand story.
89000	92000	You can find more information in our sources.
92000	98000	So now, let's witness the cruel banality of nature, the raid.
98000	102000	It all begins on a mild summer morning on a sunny field.
102000	108000	Witness this colony of over 10,000 formica ants, genetically cousins of Polyurgus,
108000	111000	who build a thriving nest underground.
111000	113000	They are a widespread genus.
113000	117000	Some species are good fighters, some great builders, and some cattle farmers,
117000	122000	often welcomed by humans because they hunt vermin that hurt forests.
122000	128000	Nobody noticed the lone Polyurgus scout that briefly showed up this morning before she bolted away again.
128000	131000	The attack begins in the early afternoon.
131000	135000	The scout returns from her mission to find the formica nests.
135000	140000	She dances erratically and spreads pheromones that excite and mass recruit more and more ants
140000	144000	until a large raiding party of a thousand warrior esses has formed.
144000	149000	A close-packed, well-organized column up to 10 meters long begins to move.
149000	156000	As the Polyurgus raiding party arrives at the formica colony, the attack begins almost immediately.
156000	160000	Dozens of attackers begin digging and clearing up debris from the nest's entrance
160000	162000	to make it easier to storm.
162000	166000	As soon as they're done, hundreds of the attackers rush inside.
166000	172000	The defenders vastly outnumber their attackers and are formidable warriors able to shoot at it.
172000	179000	But instead of fighting back effectively, they seem confused and scatter rather than fighting back.
179000	184000	Polyurgus also seems to be somewhat resistant to the acid sprays of the defenders.
184000	190000	And so even if a defense is forming, the attackers use their mandibles to pierce and kill.
190000	194000	There are a few different ideas as to why Polyurgus attacks are so efficient,
194000	198000	and one of the most fascinating ones is chemical warfare.
198000	203000	Instead of relying on brute force, they release a propaganda pheromone
203000	207000	that makes the defenders panic, unable to mount an organized defense.
207000	213000	The attackers have nothing to gain from intense ant-to-ant combat other than immense casualties.
213000	219000	What's more, they actually want their victims to survive so that they can be raided again in a few weeks.
219000	226000	As the raid unfolds, the attackers breach deep into the colony looking for their most valuable possession,
226000	228000	the colonists' babies.
228000	234000	They grab the pupae and larvae that will make up the next generation of formica and carry them out of the nest.
234000	239000	Hundreds are abducted and brought back to the Polyurgus colony in this raid alone.
239000	245000	Well, most of them, a few unlucky ones, are eaten as a sort of snack.
245000	249000	The surviving victims will be turned into slaves.
249000	254000	After about an hour, the raid is over and the formica can begin to recover.
254000	258000	It seems their only strategy is to make even more ants.
258000	264000	A decent-sized colony can forfeit thousands of pupae in a single raiding season and still survive.
264000	269000	Although in this case, while the raid was going on, something even more sinister happened.
269000	275000	Hold that thought, though, because how are Polyurgus turning ants into slaves?
275000	278000	How to brainwash ant slaves.
278000	282000	Ants conquered almost the entire planet over 100 million years ago.
282000	287000	They owe their success to being social animals that perfected chemical communication.
287000	293000	Chemical signals and cues let ants know what their colony needs and what each individual should do.
293000	298000	And most importantly in this case, who is a friend or foe.
298000	302000	Slave-making ants are much less social than other ant species.
302000	307000	Some species miss a lot of the genes other ants have to make communication possible.
307000	310000	In a sense, they are bad at talking to each other.
310000	314000	So it may be that as Polyurgus ancestors started to abduct other ants,
314000	318000	they lost the ability to collaborate and work together productively.
318000	322000	Soon after the stolen formica offspring have been brought to the slaver colony,
322000	325000	they are progressively covered in Polyurgus pheromones.
325000	331000	They are chemically imprinted, similar to a duckling who imprints on its mother after birth.
331000	336000	When the new slaves hatch, they behave as though they are part of the Polyurgus colony
336000	339000	and begin to work for them unconditionally, keeping the nest clean,
339000	342000	caring for the next generation of slaves and masters,
342000	346000	hunting for food, and feeding their enslavers mouth to mouth.
346000	351000	This sort of brainwashing goes so far that if they encounter free formica ants in the wild,
351000	353000	they will treat them as enemies.
353000	359000	In a sense, they are not true slaves, as they serve willingly and show no interest in freedom.
359000	364000	It is more like violent abduction and adoption, which does not make things that much better.
364000	370000	And as the formica only live for a few months, a constant new supply of victims is necessary.
370000	374000	To survive, Polyurgus can never stop enslaving.
374000	377000	How to make new slave colonies
377000	380000	How are new Polyurgus colonies created?
380000	386000	After all, Polyurgus workers are so useless that a queen can't start a new colony without slaves.
386000	389000	But how does she make slaves without warriors?
389000	392000	It turns out, there are two main strategies.
392000	397000	The more dangerous one might unfold during a raid like the one we witnessed before.
397000	401000	A young Polyurgus queen silently follows the raiding party.
401000	405000	Using the chaos of the invasion, she is able to find her way to the formica queen
405000	408000	and kill her, taking over the shaken colony.
408000	411000	Although, such a victory may be very short-lived.
411000	415000	Polyurgus do not tolerate other slaver colonies within their hunting ground.
415000	420000	They raid each other fiercely too, and can destroy the competing colonies nearby.
420000	425000	So while this tactic sometimes works, it is pretty dangerous.
425000	428000	Another young queen is going for a different strategy.
428000	432000	She is looking for a formica colony that is further from her birthplace,
432000	434000	attacking a whole colony on her own.
434000	438000	She bolts through an entrance, pushing aside confused ants that try to stop her,
438000	443000	releasing a powerful appeasement pheromone that drives defenders away.
443000	448000	She has only a short time window to find the formica queen deep in the hostile nest.
448000	454000	Once she finds her target, both queens engage in a fight to the death.
454000	458000	The Polyurgus queen is well equipped with her sharp mandibles.
458000	463000	She bites and rips into her victim for about half an hour before she finally calms down.
463000	470000	Between her bites, she licks the chemical surface of the dead formica queen, covering herself in her pheromones.
470000	474000	When she is done with this macabre ritual, formica workers approach her.
474000	478000	Subdued by her intense smells, they start grooming and feeding her,
478000	481000	as though pledging their allegiance to their new ruler.
481000	483000	She still might not be done though.
483000	489000	Formica colonies often have multiple queens who all need to be defeated, which is not guaranteed.
489000	496000	Often, attacking queens will be stopped by a phalanx of workers that rip her apart or are defeated in royal battle.
496000	500000	But if she does manage to kill all the queens, the colony has been taken over
500000	505000	and the enslaved brood will begin to serve a new queen, the usurper.
505000	509000	She now begins laying eggs that are cared for by her new slaves
509000	515000	until new Polyurgus ants hatch that will soon start new raids on neighboring colonies.
515000	521000	No matter what we humans do, quietly below our feet, the World War of the Ants is raging,
521000	527000	with wild and horrible strategies fought by billions of individuals every single day.
527000	532000	Polyurgus will continue to hunt for slaves, as to stop raiding would be their demise.
532000	537000	And in the War of the Ants, there is no giving up.
538000	542000	We want to explore even more ant species in videos to come.
542000	547000	But not just ants, our planet has so many more wonders to marvel at and learn about.
547000	551000	That is, if we manage to preserve their habitats and turn the tide on climate change,
551000	556000	something we're very passionate about at Kurzgesagt and have covered extensively in past videos.
556000	560000	We've found a partner to turn our dedication into action.
