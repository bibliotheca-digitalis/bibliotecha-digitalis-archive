00:00.000 --> 00:04.000
Everything changed when the Slaver Nation attacked.

00:04.000 --> 00:09.000
What used to be a thriving colony is now a captured country.

00:09.000 --> 00:13.000
Slaves do the work, serving their new masters until they die,

00:13.000 --> 00:17.000
only to be replaced by new victims harvested in brutal raids.

00:17.000 --> 00:20.000
But let's go back to the beginning.

00:20.000 --> 00:31.000
The World War of the Ants is claiming millions of lives every day.

00:31.000 --> 00:36.000
But in the brutal world of ants, straight-up war is not the only way.

00:36.000 --> 00:42.000
Around 50 ant species practice slavery, the most extreme division of labor.

00:42.000 --> 00:48.000
We don't know how this began, but some ant species perfected this cruel trade.

00:48.000 --> 00:53.000
Meet Polyurgus, the most intense of the slaver ant tribes.

00:53.000 --> 00:57.000
There are different species, but generally they're 4 to 10 millimeters long,

00:57.000 --> 01:01.000
with brown to blackish bodies and sickle-shaped mandibles.

01:01.000 --> 01:07.000
Polyurgus has specialized in slavery so much that they've lost their ability to care for themselves.

01:07.000 --> 01:11.000
They don't clean, build nests, care for their brood, or feed themselves.

01:11.000 --> 01:14.000
They only exist for raiding.

01:14.000 --> 01:18.000
Slaves make up 80 to 90% of the ants in their colonies,

01:18.000 --> 01:23.000
so a few hundred Polyurgus and a single queen control thousands of slave ants.

01:23.000 --> 01:29.000
We'll summarize and simplify what we know about Polyurgus into one grand story.

01:29.000 --> 01:32.000
You can find more information in our sources.

01:32.000 --> 01:38.000
So now, let's witness the cruel banality of nature, the raid.

01:38.000 --> 01:42.000
It all begins on a mild summer morning on a sunny field.

01:42.000 --> 01:48.000
Witness this colony of over 10,000 formica ants, genetically cousins of Polyurgus,

01:48.000 --> 01:51.000
who build a thriving nest underground.

01:51.000 --> 01:53.000
They are a widespread genus.

01:53.000 --> 01:57.000
Some species are good fighters, some great builders, and some cattle farmers,

01:57.000 --> 02:02.000
often welcomed by humans because they hunt vermin that hurt forests.

02:02.000 --> 02:08.000
Nobody noticed the lone Polyurgus scout that briefly showed up this morning before she bolted away again.

02:08.000 --> 02:11.000
The attack begins in the early afternoon.

02:11.000 --> 02:15.000
The scout returns from her mission to find the formica nests.

02:15.000 --> 02:20.000
She dances erratically and spreads pheromones that excite and mass recruit more and more ants

02:20.000 --> 02:24.000
until a large raiding party of a thousand warrior esses has formed.

02:24.000 --> 02:29.000
A close-packed, well-organized column up to 10 meters long begins to move.

02:29.000 --> 02:36.000
As the Polyurgus raiding party arrives at the formica colony, the attack begins almost immediately.

02:36.000 --> 02:40.000
Dozens of attackers begin digging and clearing up debris from the nest's entrance

02:40.000 --> 02:42.000
to make it easier to storm.

02:42.000 --> 02:46.000
As soon as they're done, hundreds of the attackers rush inside.

02:46.000 --> 02:52.000
The defenders vastly outnumber their attackers and are formidable warriors able to shoot at it.

02:52.000 --> 02:59.000
But instead of fighting back effectively, they seem confused and scatter rather than fighting back.

02:59.000 --> 03:04.000
Polyurgus also seems to be somewhat resistant to the acid sprays of the defenders.

03:04.000 --> 03:10.000
And so even if a defense is forming, the attackers use their mandibles to pierce and kill.

03:10.000 --> 03:14.000
There are a few different ideas as to why Polyurgus attacks are so efficient,

03:14.000 --> 03:18.000
and one of the most fascinating ones is chemical warfare.

03:18.000 --> 03:23.000
Instead of relying on brute force, they release a propaganda pheromone

03:23.000 --> 03:27.000
that makes the defenders panic, unable to mount an organized defense.

03:27.000 --> 03:33.000
The attackers have nothing to gain from intense ant-to-ant combat other than immense casualties.

03:33.000 --> 03:39.000
What's more, they actually want their victims to survive so that they can be raided again in a few weeks.

03:39.000 --> 03:46.000
As the raid unfolds, the attackers breach deep into the colony looking for their most valuable possession,

03:46.000 --> 03:48.000
the colonists' babies.

03:48.000 --> 03:54.000
They grab the pupae and larvae that will make up the next generation of formica and carry them out of the nest.

03:54.000 --> 03:59.000
Hundreds are abducted and brought back to the Polyurgus colony in this raid alone.

03:59.000 --> 04:05.000
Well, most of them, a few unlucky ones, are eaten as a sort of snack.

04:05.000 --> 04:09.000
The surviving victims will be turned into slaves.

04:09.000 --> 04:14.000
After about an hour, the raid is over and the formica can begin to recover.

04:14.000 --> 04:18.000
It seems their only strategy is to make even more ants.

04:18.000 --> 04:24.000
A decent-sized colony can forfeit thousands of pupae in a single raiding season and still survive.

04:24.000 --> 04:29.000
Although in this case, while the raid was going on, something even more sinister happened.

04:29.000 --> 04:35.000
Hold that thought, though, because how are Polyurgus turning ants into slaves?

04:35.000 --> 04:38.000
How to brainwash ant slaves.

04:38.000 --> 04:42.000
Ants conquered almost the entire planet over 100 million years ago.

04:42.000 --> 04:47.000
They owe their success to being social animals that perfected chemical communication.

04:47.000 --> 04:53.000
Chemical signals and cues let ants know what their colony needs and what each individual should do.

04:53.000 --> 04:58.000
And most importantly in this case, who is a friend or foe.

04:58.000 --> 05:02.000
Slave-making ants are much less social than other ant species.

05:02.000 --> 05:07.000
Some species miss a lot of the genes other ants have to make communication possible.

05:07.000 --> 05:10.000
In a sense, they are bad at talking to each other.

05:10.000 --> 05:14.000
So it may be that as Polyurgus ancestors started to abduct other ants,

05:14.000 --> 05:18.000
they lost the ability to collaborate and work together productively.

05:18.000 --> 05:22.000
Soon after the stolen formica offspring have been brought to the slaver colony,

05:22.000 --> 05:25.000
they are progressively covered in Polyurgus pheromones.

05:25.000 --> 05:31.000
They are chemically imprinted, similar to a duckling who imprints on its mother after birth.

05:31.000 --> 05:36.000
When the new slaves hatch, they behave as though they are part of the Polyurgus colony

05:36.000 --> 05:39.000
and begin to work for them unconditionally, keeping the nest clean,

05:39.000 --> 05:42.000
caring for the next generation of slaves and masters,

05:42.000 --> 05:46.000
hunting for food, and feeding their enslavers mouth to mouth.

05:46.000 --> 05:51.000
This sort of brainwashing goes so far that if they encounter free formica ants in the wild,

05:51.000 --> 05:53.000
they will treat them as enemies.

05:53.000 --> 05:59.000
In a sense, they are not true slaves, as they serve willingly and show no interest in freedom.

05:59.000 --> 06:04.000
It is more like violent abduction and adoption, which does not make things that much better.

06:04.000 --> 06:10.000
And as the formica only live for a few months, a constant new supply of victims is necessary.

06:10.000 --> 06:14.000
To survive, Polyurgus can never stop enslaving.

06:14.000 --> 06:17.000
How to make new slave colonies

06:17.000 --> 06:20.000
How are new Polyurgus colonies created?

06:20.000 --> 06:26.000
After all, Polyurgus workers are so useless that a queen can't start a new colony without slaves.

06:26.000 --> 06:29.000
But how does she make slaves without warriors?

06:29.000 --> 06:32.000
It turns out, there are two main strategies.

06:32.000 --> 06:37.000
The more dangerous one might unfold during a raid like the one we witnessed before.

06:37.000 --> 06:41.000
A young Polyurgus queen silently follows the raiding party.

06:41.000 --> 06:45.000
Using the chaos of the invasion, she is able to find her way to the formica queen

06:45.000 --> 06:48.000
and kill her, taking over the shaken colony.

06:48.000 --> 06:51.000
Although, such a victory may be very short-lived.

06:51.000 --> 06:55.000
Polyurgus do not tolerate other slaver colonies within their hunting ground.

06:55.000 --> 07:00.000
They raid each other fiercely too, and can destroy the competing colonies nearby.

07:00.000 --> 07:05.000
So while this tactic sometimes works, it is pretty dangerous.

07:05.000 --> 07:08.000
Another young queen is going for a different strategy.

07:08.000 --> 07:12.000
She is looking for a formica colony that is further from her birthplace,

07:12.000 --> 07:14.000
attacking a whole colony on her own.

07:14.000 --> 07:18.000
She bolts through an entrance, pushing aside confused ants that try to stop her,

07:18.000 --> 07:23.000
releasing a powerful appeasement pheromone that drives defenders away.

07:23.000 --> 07:28.000
She has only a short time window to find the formica queen deep in the hostile nest.

07:28.000 --> 07:34.000
Once she finds her target, both queens engage in a fight to the death.

07:34.000 --> 07:38.000
The Polyurgus queen is well equipped with her sharp mandibles.

07:38.000 --> 07:43.000
She bites and rips into her victim for about half an hour before she finally calms down.

07:43.000 --> 07:50.000
Between her bites, she licks the chemical surface of the dead formica queen, covering herself in her pheromones.

07:50.000 --> 07:54.000
When she is done with this macabre ritual, formica workers approach her.

07:54.000 --> 07:58.000
Subdued by her intense smells, they start grooming and feeding her,

07:58.000 --> 08:01.000
as though pledging their allegiance to their new ruler.

08:01.000 --> 08:03.000
She still might not be done though.

08:03.000 --> 08:09.000
Formica colonies often have multiple queens who all need to be defeated, which is not guaranteed.

08:09.000 --> 08:16.000
Often, attacking queens will be stopped by a phalanx of workers that rip her apart or are defeated in royal battle.

08:16.000 --> 08:20.000
But if she does manage to kill all the queens, the colony has been taken over

08:20.000 --> 08:25.000
and the enslaved brood will begin to serve a new queen, the usurper.

08:25.000 --> 08:29.000
She now begins laying eggs that are cared for by her new slaves

08:29.000 --> 08:35.000
until new Polyurgus ants hatch that will soon start new raids on neighboring colonies.

08:35.000 --> 08:41.000
No matter what we humans do, quietly below our feet, the World War of the Ants is raging,

08:41.000 --> 08:47.000
with wild and horrible strategies fought by billions of individuals every single day.

08:47.000 --> 08:52.000
Polyurgus will continue to hunt for slaves, as to stop raiding would be their demise.

08:52.000 --> 08:57.000
And in the War of the Ants, there is no giving up.

08:58.000 --> 09:02.000
We want to explore even more ant species in videos to come.

09:02.000 --> 09:07.000
But not just ants, our planet has so many more wonders to marvel at and learn about.

09:07.000 --> 09:11.000
That is, if we manage to preserve their habitats and turn the tide on climate change,

09:11.000 --> 09:16.000
something we're very passionate about at Kurzgesagt and have covered extensively in past videos.

09:16.000 --> 09:20.000
We've found a partner to turn our dedication into action.

09:20.000 --> 09:25.000
We'll pay to offset one month of your carbon emissions with the help of our friends from Wren.

09:25.000 --> 09:31.000
By visiting wren.co and answering a few questions, you can find out your personal carbon footprint.

09:31.000 --> 09:35.000
Your first step should be to reduce your footprint, but there are limits to that.

09:35.000 --> 09:39.000
Wren lets you offset the rest of your carbon footprint with a monthly subscription

09:39.000 --> 09:45.000
that supports projects that plant trees, protect rainforests, and remove carbon dioxide from the sky.

09:45.000 --> 09:50.000
We think it's one of the many puzzle pieces that can make a real difference in the climate crisis.

09:50.000 --> 09:55.000
Once you sign up to make a monthly contribution, you'll get pictures and updates from the project you support,

09:55.000 --> 09:58.000
so you can directly see the impact you're making.

09:58.000 --> 10:01.000
Wren is completely transparent about how they spend the money,

10:01.000 --> 10:05.000
and we especially like their Rainforest Protection Project in the Amazon,

10:05.000 --> 10:11.000
another amazing ecosystem full of wonder we want coming generations to learn about as well.

10:11.000 --> 10:17.000
Wren's project trains indigenous communities to use drones and satellite imagery to detect deforestation,

10:17.000 --> 10:20.000
helping them protect their rainforest home.

10:20.000 --> 10:24.000
Sign up through wren.co.uk to start helping the planet.

10:24.000 --> 10:29.000
As climate change is close to our hearts, we will personally pay for the first month of subscription

10:29.000 --> 10:32.000
for the first 200 people to sign up.
