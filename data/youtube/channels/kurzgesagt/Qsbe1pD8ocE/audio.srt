1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
Everything changed when the Slaver Nation attacked.

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:09,000
What used to be a thriving colony is now a captured country.

3
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:13,000
Slaves do the work, serving their new masters until they die,

4
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:17,000
only to be replaced by new victims harvested in brutal raids.

5
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:20,000
But let's go back to the beginning.

6
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:31,000
The World War of the Ants is claiming millions of lives every day.

7
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:36,000
But in the brutal world of ants, straight-up war is not the only way.

8
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:42,000
Around 50 ant species practice slavery, the most extreme division of labor.

9
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:48,000
We don't know how this began, but some ant species perfected this cruel trade.

10
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:53,000
Meet Polyurgus, the most intense of the slaver ant tribes.

11
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:57,000
There are different species, but generally they're 4 to 10 millimeters long,

12
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:01,000
with brown to blackish bodies and sickle-shaped mandibles.

13
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:07,000
Polyurgus has specialized in slavery so much that they've lost their ability to care for themselves.

14
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:11,000
They don't clean, build nests, care for their brood, or feed themselves.

15
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:14,000
They only exist for raiding.

16
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:18,000
Slaves make up 80 to 90% of the ants in their colonies,

17
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:23,000
so a few hundred Polyurgus and a single queen control thousands of slave ants.

18
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:29,000
We'll summarize and simplify what we know about Polyurgus into one grand story.

19
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:32,000
You can find more information in our sources.

20
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:38,000
So now, let's witness the cruel banality of nature, the raid.

21
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:42,000
It all begins on a mild summer morning on a sunny field.

22
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:48,000
Witness this colony of over 10,000 formica ants, genetically cousins of Polyurgus,

23
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:51,000
who build a thriving nest underground.

24
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:53,000
They are a widespread genus.

25
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:57,000
Some species are good fighters, some great builders, and some cattle farmers,

26
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:02,000
often welcomed by humans because they hunt vermin that hurt forests.

27
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:08,000
Nobody noticed the lone Polyurgus scout that briefly showed up this morning before she bolted away again.

28
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:11,000
The attack begins in the early afternoon.

29
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:15,000
The scout returns from her mission to find the formica nests.

30
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:20,000
She dances erratically and spreads pheromones that excite and mass recruit more and more ants

31
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:24,000
until a large raiding party of a thousand warrior esses has formed.

32
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:29,000
A close-packed, well-organized column up to 10 meters long begins to move.

33
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:36,000
As the Polyurgus raiding party arrives at the formica colony, the attack begins almost immediately.

34
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:40,000
Dozens of attackers begin digging and clearing up debris from the nest's entrance

35
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,000
to make it easier to storm.

36
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:46,000
As soon as they're done, hundreds of the attackers rush inside.

37
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:52,000
The defenders vastly outnumber their attackers and are formidable warriors able to shoot at it.

38
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:59,000
But instead of fighting back effectively, they seem confused and scatter rather than fighting back.

39
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:04,000
Polyurgus also seems to be somewhat resistant to the acid sprays of the defenders.

40
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:10,000
And so even if a defense is forming, the attackers use their mandibles to pierce and kill.

41
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:14,000
There are a few different ideas as to why Polyurgus attacks are so efficient,

42
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:18,000
and one of the most fascinating ones is chemical warfare.

43
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:23,000
Instead of relying on brute force, they release a propaganda pheromone

44
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:27,000
that makes the defenders panic, unable to mount an organized defense.

45
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:33,000
The attackers have nothing to gain from intense ant-to-ant combat other than immense casualties.

46
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:39,000
What's more, they actually want their victims to survive so that they can be raided again in a few weeks.

47
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:46,000
As the raid unfolds, the attackers breach deep into the colony looking for their most valuable possession,

48
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,000
the colonists' babies.

49
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:54,000
They grab the pupae and larvae that will make up the next generation of formica and carry them out of the nest.

50
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:59,000
Hundreds are abducted and brought back to the Polyurgus colony in this raid alone.

51
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:05,000
Well, most of them, a few unlucky ones, are eaten as a sort of snack.

52
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:09,000
The surviving victims will be turned into slaves.

53
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:14,000
After about an hour, the raid is over and the formica can begin to recover.

54
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:18,000
It seems their only strategy is to make even more ants.

55
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:24,000
A decent-sized colony can forfeit thousands of pupae in a single raiding season and still survive.

56
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:29,000
Although in this case, while the raid was going on, something even more sinister happened.

57
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:35,000
Hold that thought, though, because how are Polyurgus turning ants into slaves?

58
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:38,000
How to brainwash ant slaves.

59
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:42,000
Ants conquered almost the entire planet over 100 million years ago.

60
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:47,000
They owe their success to being social animals that perfected chemical communication.

61
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:53,000
Chemical signals and cues let ants know what their colony needs and what each individual should do.

62
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:58,000
And most importantly in this case, who is a friend or foe.

63
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:02,000
Slave-making ants are much less social than other ant species.

64
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:07,000
Some species miss a lot of the genes other ants have to make communication possible.

65
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:10,000
In a sense, they are bad at talking to each other.

66
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:14,000
So it may be that as Polyurgus ancestors started to abduct other ants,

67
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:18,000
they lost the ability to collaborate and work together productively.

68
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:22,000
Soon after the stolen formica offspring have been brought to the slaver colony,

69
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:25,000
they are progressively covered in Polyurgus pheromones.

70
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:31,000
They are chemically imprinted, similar to a duckling who imprints on its mother after birth.

71
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:36,000
When the new slaves hatch, they behave as though they are part of the Polyurgus colony

72
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:39,000
and begin to work for them unconditionally, keeping the nest clean,

73
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:42,000
caring for the next generation of slaves and masters,

74
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:46,000
hunting for food, and feeding their enslavers mouth to mouth.

75
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:51,000
This sort of brainwashing goes so far that if they encounter free formica ants in the wild,

76
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:53,000
they will treat them as enemies.

77
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:59,000
In a sense, they are not true slaves, as they serve willingly and show no interest in freedom.

78
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:04,000
It is more like violent abduction and adoption, which does not make things that much better.

79
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:10,000
And as the formica only live for a few months, a constant new supply of victims is necessary.

80
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:14,000
To survive, Polyurgus can never stop enslaving.

81
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:17,000
How to make new slave colonies

82
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:20,000
How are new Polyurgus colonies created?

83
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:26,000
After all, Polyurgus workers are so useless that a queen can't start a new colony without slaves.

84
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:29,000
But how does she make slaves without warriors?

85
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:32,000
It turns out, there are two main strategies.

86
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:37,000
The more dangerous one might unfold during a raid like the one we witnessed before.

87
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:41,000
A young Polyurgus queen silently follows the raiding party.

88
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:45,000
Using the chaos of the invasion, she is able to find her way to the formica queen

89
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:48,000
and kill her, taking over the shaken colony.

90
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:51,000
Although, such a victory may be very short-lived.

91
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:55,000
Polyurgus do not tolerate other slaver colonies within their hunting ground.

92
00:06:55,000 --> 00:07:00,000
They raid each other fiercely too, and can destroy the competing colonies nearby.

93
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:05,000
So while this tactic sometimes works, it is pretty dangerous.

94
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:08,000
Another young queen is going for a different strategy.

95
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:12,000
She is looking for a formica colony that is further from her birthplace,

96
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:14,000
attacking a whole colony on her own.

97
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:18,000
She bolts through an entrance, pushing aside confused ants that try to stop her,

98
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:23,000
releasing a powerful appeasement pheromone that drives defenders away.

99
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:28,000
She has only a short time window to find the formica queen deep in the hostile nest.

100
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:34,000
Once she finds her target, both queens engage in a fight to the death.

101
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:38,000
The Polyurgus queen is well equipped with her sharp mandibles.

102
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:43,000
She bites and rips into her victim for about half an hour before she finally calms down.

103
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:50,000
Between her bites, she licks the chemical surface of the dead formica queen, covering herself in her pheromones.

104
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:54,000
When she is done with this macabre ritual, formica workers approach her.

105
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:58,000
Subdued by her intense smells, they start grooming and feeding her,

106
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:01,000
as though pledging their allegiance to their new ruler.

107
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:03,000
She still might not be done though.

108
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:09,000
Formica colonies often have multiple queens who all need to be defeated, which is not guaranteed.

109
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:16,000
Often, attacking queens will be stopped by a phalanx of workers that rip her apart or are defeated in royal battle.

110
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:20,000
But if she does manage to kill all the queens, the colony has been taken over

111
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:25,000
and the enslaved brood will begin to serve a new queen, the usurper.

112
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:29,000
She now begins laying eggs that are cared for by her new slaves

113
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:35,000
until new Polyurgus ants hatch that will soon start new raids on neighboring colonies.

114
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:41,000
No matter what we humans do, quietly below our feet, the World War of the Ants is raging,

115
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:47,000
with wild and horrible strategies fought by billions of individuals every single day.

116
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:52,000
Polyurgus will continue to hunt for slaves, as to stop raiding would be their demise.

117
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:57,000
And in the War of the Ants, there is no giving up.

118
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:02,000
We want to explore even more ant species in videos to come.

119
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:07,000
But not just ants, our planet has so many more wonders to marvel at and learn about.

120
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:11,000
That is, if we manage to preserve their habitats and turn the tide on climate change,

121
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:16,000
something we're very passionate about at Kurzgesagt and have covered extensively in past videos.

122
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:20,000
We've found a partner to turn our dedication into action.

123
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:25,000
We'll pay to offset one month of your carbon emissions with the help of our friends from Wren.

124
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:31,000
By visiting wren.co and answering a few questions, you can find out your personal carbon footprint.

125
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:35,000
Your first step should be to reduce your footprint, but there are limits to that.

126
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:39,000
Wren lets you offset the rest of your carbon footprint with a monthly subscription

127
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:45,000
that supports projects that plant trees, protect rainforests, and remove carbon dioxide from the sky.

128
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:50,000
We think it's one of the many puzzle pieces that can make a real difference in the climate crisis.

129
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:55,000
Once you sign up to make a monthly contribution, you'll get pictures and updates from the project you support,

130
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:58,000
so you can directly see the impact you're making.

131
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:01,000
Wren is completely transparent about how they spend the money,

132
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:05,000
and we especially like their Rainforest Protection Project in the Amazon,

133
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:11,000
another amazing ecosystem full of wonder we want coming generations to learn about as well.

134
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:17,000
Wren's project trains indigenous communities to use drones and satellite imagery to detect deforestation,

135
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:20,000
helping them protect their rainforest home.

136
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:24,000
Sign up through wren.co.uk to start helping the planet.

137
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:29,000
As climate change is close to our hearts, we will personally pay for the first month of subscription

138
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:32,000
for the first 200 people to sign up.
