00:00.720 --> 00:06.000
When the gods granted King Midas one wish, he wished that everything he touched would

00:06.000 --> 00:14.560
turn to gold. Midas was delighted. Trees, rocks, buildings, all gold. But soon, he found in horror

00:14.560 --> 00:20.000
that his food turned into gold as well. When he hugged his daughter to soothe his pain,

00:20.000 --> 00:28.080
he realized his mistake too late. The richest man in existence was starving, heartbroken, and alone.

00:29.040 --> 00:35.600
Humanity got a similar wish granted when we learned how to turn brown stinky goo into magic.

00:35.600 --> 00:44.160
Plastic. Cheap, sterile, and convenient, it changed our lives. But this wonder of technology

00:44.160 --> 00:48.960
got a little out of hand. Plastic has saturated our environment,

00:48.960 --> 00:55.040
it has invaded the animals we eat, and now it's finding its way into our bodies.

00:58.320 --> 01:06.320
What is plastic?

01:07.360 --> 01:11.920
For most of our history, humans used stuff we found in nature to build the things we needed.

01:11.920 --> 01:18.640
But the invention of plastic roughly 100 years ago completely changed our world. Plastic is made

01:18.640 --> 01:25.360
from polymers, long repeating chains of molecule groups. In nature, polymers exist everywhere.

01:25.360 --> 01:34.720
The walls of cells, silk, hair, insect carapaces, DNA. But it's also possible to create them.

01:35.360 --> 01:39.600
By breaking down crude oil into its components and rearranging them,

01:39.600 --> 01:45.680
we can form new synthetic polymers. Synthetic polymers have extraordinary traits.

01:45.680 --> 01:51.280
They are lightweight, durable, and can be molded into almost any shape. Not requiring

01:51.280 --> 01:57.040
time-consuming manual work, plastic can be easily mass-produced, and its raw materials

01:57.040 --> 02:03.840
are available in vast amounts and incredibly cheaply. And so the golden era of plastics began.

02:04.960 --> 02:11.040
Baker light was used for mechanical parts, PVC for plumbing, electric gears and cases,

02:11.040 --> 02:16.720
acrylic as a shatter-resistant alternative to glass, and nylon for stockings and war equipment.

02:17.440 --> 02:23.360
Today, almost everything is at least partly made from plastic. Our clothes, phones, computers,

02:23.360 --> 02:29.600
furniture, appliances, houses, and cars. Plastic has long ceased to be a revolutionary material.

02:29.600 --> 02:35.360
Instead, it became trash. Coffee cups, plastic bags, or stuff to wrap a banana.

02:35.360 --> 02:41.920
We don't think about this fact a lot. Plastic just appears and goes away. Unfortunately, it doesn't.

02:41.920 --> 02:50.080
Since synthetic polymers are so durable, plastic takes between 500 and 1,000 years to break down.

02:50.880 --> 02:55.920
But somehow, we collectively decided to use this super-tough material for things

02:55.920 --> 03:03.920
meant to be thrown away. 40% of plastics are used for packaging. In the US, packaging makes

03:03.920 --> 03:10.320
up one-third of all the waste that is generated annually. Since its invention, we have produced

03:10.320 --> 03:20.240
about 8.3 billion metric tons of plastic, 335 million tons in 2016 alone. More than 6.3 billion

03:20.240 --> 03:27.120
metric tons of plastic have become waste since 1907. Piled up in one place, that makes a cube

03:27.120 --> 03:35.280
with a side length of 1.9 kilometers. So, what did we do with all this waste? 9% was recycled,

03:35.920 --> 03:41.120
12% burned, but 79% of it is sticking around still.

03:42.560 --> 03:46.560
A lot ends up in the ocean, around 8 million tons a year.

03:47.280 --> 03:52.640
That's so much plastic that it will outweigh all the fish in the ocean by 2050.

03:54.000 --> 03:58.400
Because it's everywhere, marine animals keep getting trapped in plastic and swallowing it.

03:59.040 --> 04:03.040
In 2015 already, 90% of seabirds had eaten plastic.

04:04.000 --> 04:08.080
Many animals starve with stomachs full of indigestible trash.

04:08.080 --> 04:15.520
In 2018, a dead sperm whale washed up in Spain. He had eaten 32 kilos of plastic bags, nets,

04:15.520 --> 04:22.000
and a drum. While this is tragic and makes for great magazine covers, there's an even more

04:22.000 --> 04:26.400
widespread, invisible form of plastic. Microplastics.

04:27.600 --> 04:33.680
Microplastics are pieces smaller than 5 millimeters. Some of them are used in cosmetics

04:33.680 --> 04:40.080
or toothpaste, but most result from floating waste that is constantly exposed to UV radiation

04:40.080 --> 04:46.560
and crumbles into smaller and smaller pieces. 51 trillion such particles float in the ocean

04:46.560 --> 04:50.240
where they are even more easily swallowed by all kinds of marine life.

04:51.040 --> 04:55.680
This has raised concerns among scientists, especially about health risks from the chemicals

04:55.680 --> 05:01.280
that are added to plastic. BPA, for example, makes plastic bottles transparent, but there's

05:01.280 --> 05:08.160
also evidence that it interferes with our hormonal system. DEHP makes plastics more flexible but may

05:08.160 --> 05:14.480
cause cancer. It would be pretty bad if microplastics are toxic because they travel up the

05:14.480 --> 05:21.760
food chain. Zooplankton eat microplastic. Small fish eat zooplankton. So do oysters,

05:21.760 --> 05:29.200
crabs, and predatory fish. And they all land on our plate. Microplastics have been found in honey,

05:29.200 --> 05:34.320
in sea salt, in beer, in tap water, and in the household dust around us.

05:35.200 --> 05:40.240
8 out of 10 babies and nearly all adults have measurable amounts of phthalates,

05:40.240 --> 05:46.160
a common plastic additive in their bodies. And 93% of people have BPA in their urine.

05:46.960 --> 05:52.480
There is little science about this so far, and right now it's inconclusive. We need a lot more

05:52.480 --> 05:57.920
research before panic is justified. But it is safe to say that a lot of stuff happened that we

05:57.920 --> 06:03.680
didn't plan for. And we have lost control over plastic to a certain extent, which is kind of

06:03.680 --> 06:10.160
scary. But just to make sure, we should simply ban plastics, right? Unfortunately,

06:10.160 --> 06:15.440
it's a bit more complicated than that. Plastic pollution is not the only environmental challenge

06:15.440 --> 06:20.800
we face. Some of the substitutes we'd use for plastic have a higher environmental impact in

06:20.800 --> 06:26.560
other ways. For example, according to a recent study by the Danish government, making a single

06:26.560 --> 06:32.240
use plastic bag requires so little energy and produces far lower carbon dioxide emissions

06:32.240 --> 06:39.520
compared to a reusable cotton bag that you need to use your cotton bag 7,100 times before it would

06:39.520 --> 06:45.760
have a lower impact on the environment than the plastic bag. We're left with a complex process

06:45.760 --> 06:50.800
of trade-offs. Everything has an impact somehow, and it's hard to find the right balance between

06:50.800 --> 06:56.080
them. Plastic also helps solve problems that we don't have very good answers for at the moment.

06:56.640 --> 07:01.840
Globally, one third of all food that's produced is never eaten and ends up rotting away on landfills,

07:01.840 --> 07:06.480
where it produces methane. And the best way of preventing food from spoiling and avoiding

07:06.480 --> 07:12.720
unnecessary waste is still plastic packaging. It's also important to note where the vast majority of

07:12.720 --> 07:18.480
the world's plastic pollution is coming from right now. 90% of all plastic waste entering the ocean

07:18.480 --> 07:25.920
through rivers comes from just 10 rivers in Asia and Africa. The Yangtze in China alone flushes 1.5

07:25.920 --> 07:31.680
million tons of plastic into the ocean each year. Countries like China, India, Algeria,

07:31.680 --> 07:37.440
or Indonesia industrialized at an impressive pace in the last few decades, transforming the lives

07:37.440 --> 07:42.880
of billions of people. This development was so fast that the garbage disposal infrastructure

07:42.880 --> 07:48.400
couldn't keep up with collecting and recycling all the new waste this brought. If politicians in

07:48.400 --> 07:53.040
Europe and the US want to address this issue, investing in infrastructure in developing

07:53.040 --> 07:58.000
countries is just as important as fighting plastic pollution at home with campaigns and

07:58.000 --> 08:04.000
redesigning products to minimize unnecessary plastic production. The bottom line is, as long

08:04.000 --> 08:08.480
as we don't address plastic pollution from a global perspective, we will not solve it.

08:09.280 --> 08:16.000
Plastic pollution is a complicated problem. We found a magic material and we had a really good

08:16.000 --> 08:23.280
time with it. But we need to be careful, or just like Midas, we'll end up in a world that we didn't

08:23.280 --> 08:32.240
wish for. Your individual daily actions still have a huge impact. What you do matters. Refuse

08:32.240 --> 08:38.240
disposable plastics. Convince your friends and family to do the same. Pressure companies and

08:38.240 --> 08:44.560
politicians to take the necessary steps to keep our oceans clean and our food safe. Together,

08:44.560 --> 08:50.160
we can beat plastic pollution. This video was a collaboration with the UN Environment

08:50.160 --> 08:55.520
and their Clean Seas campaign. If you want to take action to turn the tide on plastics,

08:55.520 --> 09:01.200
go to cleanseas.org and make your pledge.
