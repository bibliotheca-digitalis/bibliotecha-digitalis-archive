1
00:00:00,720 --> 00:00:06,000
When the gods granted King Midas one wish, he wished that everything he touched would

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:14,560
turn to gold. Midas was delighted. Trees, rocks, buildings, all gold. But soon, he found in horror

3
00:00:14,560 --> 00:00:20,000
that his food turned into gold as well. When he hugged his daughter to soothe his pain,

4
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:28,080
he realized his mistake too late. The richest man in existence was starving, heartbroken, and alone.

5
00:00:29,040 --> 00:00:35,600
Humanity got a similar wish granted when we learned how to turn brown stinky goo into magic.

6
00:00:35,600 --> 00:00:44,160
Plastic. Cheap, sterile, and convenient, it changed our lives. But this wonder of technology

7
00:00:44,160 --> 00:00:48,960
got a little out of hand. Plastic has saturated our environment,

8
00:00:48,960 --> 00:00:55,040
it has invaded the animals we eat, and now it's finding its way into our bodies.

9
00:00:58,320 --> 00:01:06,320
What is plastic?

10
00:01:07,360 --> 00:01:11,920
For most of our history, humans used stuff we found in nature to build the things we needed.

11
00:01:11,920 --> 00:01:18,640
But the invention of plastic roughly 100 years ago completely changed our world. Plastic is made

12
00:01:18,640 --> 00:01:25,360
from polymers, long repeating chains of molecule groups. In nature, polymers exist everywhere.

13
00:01:25,360 --> 00:01:34,720
The walls of cells, silk, hair, insect carapaces, DNA. But it's also possible to create them.

14
00:01:35,360 --> 00:01:39,600
By breaking down crude oil into its components and rearranging them,

15
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:45,680
we can form new synthetic polymers. Synthetic polymers have extraordinary traits.

16
00:01:45,680 --> 00:01:51,280
They are lightweight, durable, and can be molded into almost any shape. Not requiring

17
00:01:51,280 --> 00:01:57,040
time-consuming manual work, plastic can be easily mass-produced, and its raw materials

18
00:01:57,040 --> 00:02:03,840
are available in vast amounts and incredibly cheaply. And so the golden era of plastics began.

19
00:02:04,960 --> 00:02:11,040
Baker light was used for mechanical parts, PVC for plumbing, electric gears and cases,

20
00:02:11,040 --> 00:02:16,720
acrylic as a shatter-resistant alternative to glass, and nylon for stockings and war equipment.

21
00:02:17,440 --> 00:02:23,360
Today, almost everything is at least partly made from plastic. Our clothes, phones, computers,

22
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:29,600
furniture, appliances, houses, and cars. Plastic has long ceased to be a revolutionary material.

23
00:02:29,600 --> 00:02:35,360
Instead, it became trash. Coffee cups, plastic bags, or stuff to wrap a banana.

24
00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:41,920
We don't think about this fact a lot. Plastic just appears and goes away. Unfortunately, it doesn't.

25
00:02:41,920 --> 00:02:50,080
Since synthetic polymers are so durable, plastic takes between 500 and 1,000 years to break down.

26
00:02:50,880 --> 00:02:55,920
But somehow, we collectively decided to use this super-tough material for things

27
00:02:55,920 --> 00:03:03,920
meant to be thrown away. 40% of plastics are used for packaging. In the US, packaging makes

28
00:03:03,920 --> 00:03:10,320
up one-third of all the waste that is generated annually. Since its invention, we have produced

29
00:03:10,320 --> 00:03:20,240
about 8.3 billion metric tons of plastic, 335 million tons in 2016 alone. More than 6.3 billion

30
00:03:20,240 --> 00:03:27,120
metric tons of plastic have become waste since 1907. Piled up in one place, that makes a cube

31
00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:35,280
with a side length of 1.9 kilometers. So, what did we do with all this waste? 9% was recycled,

32
00:03:35,920 --> 00:03:41,120
12% burned, but 79% of it is sticking around still.

33
00:03:42,560 --> 00:03:46,560
A lot ends up in the ocean, around 8 million tons a year.

34
00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:52,640
That's so much plastic that it will outweigh all the fish in the ocean by 2050.

35
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:58,400
Because it's everywhere, marine animals keep getting trapped in plastic and swallowing it.

36
00:03:59,040 --> 00:04:03,040
In 2015 already, 90% of seabirds had eaten plastic.

37
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:08,080
Many animals starve with stomachs full of indigestible trash.

38
00:04:08,080 --> 00:04:15,520
In 2018, a dead sperm whale washed up in Spain. He had eaten 32 kilos of plastic bags, nets,

39
00:04:15,520 --> 00:04:22,000
and a drum. While this is tragic and makes for great magazine covers, there's an even more

40
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:26,400
widespread, invisible form of plastic. Microplastics.

41
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:33,680
Microplastics are pieces smaller than 5 millimeters. Some of them are used in cosmetics

42
00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:40,080
or toothpaste, but most result from floating waste that is constantly exposed to UV radiation

43
00:04:40,080 --> 00:04:46,560
and crumbles into smaller and smaller pieces. 51 trillion such particles float in the ocean

44
00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:50,240
where they are even more easily swallowed by all kinds of marine life.

45
00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:55,680
This has raised concerns among scientists, especially about health risks from the chemicals

46
00:04:55,680 --> 00:05:01,280
that are added to plastic. BPA, for example, makes plastic bottles transparent, but there's

47
00:05:01,280 --> 00:05:08,160
also evidence that it interferes with our hormonal system. DEHP makes plastics more flexible but may

48
00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:14,480
cause cancer. It would be pretty bad if microplastics are toxic because they travel up the

49
00:05:14,480 --> 00:05:21,760
food chain. Zooplankton eat microplastic. Small fish eat zooplankton. So do oysters,

50
00:05:21,760 --> 00:05:29,200
crabs, and predatory fish. And they all land on our plate. Microplastics have been found in honey,

51
00:05:29,200 --> 00:05:34,320
in sea salt, in beer, in tap water, and in the household dust around us.

52
00:05:35,200 --> 00:05:40,240
8 out of 10 babies and nearly all adults have measurable amounts of phthalates,

53
00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:46,160
a common plastic additive in their bodies. And 93% of people have BPA in their urine.

54
00:05:46,960 --> 00:05:52,480
There is little science about this so far, and right now it's inconclusive. We need a lot more

55
00:05:52,480 --> 00:05:57,920
research before panic is justified. But it is safe to say that a lot of stuff happened that we

56
00:05:57,920 --> 00:06:03,680
didn't plan for. And we have lost control over plastic to a certain extent, which is kind of

57
00:06:03,680 --> 00:06:10,160
scary. But just to make sure, we should simply ban plastics, right? Unfortunately,

58
00:06:10,160 --> 00:06:15,440
it's a bit more complicated than that. Plastic pollution is not the only environmental challenge

59
00:06:15,440 --> 00:06:20,800
we face. Some of the substitutes we'd use for plastic have a higher environmental impact in

60
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:26,560
other ways. For example, according to a recent study by the Danish government, making a single

61
00:06:26,560 --> 00:06:32,240
use plastic bag requires so little energy and produces far lower carbon dioxide emissions

62
00:06:32,240 --> 00:06:39,520
compared to a reusable cotton bag that you need to use your cotton bag 7,100 times before it would

63
00:06:39,520 --> 00:06:45,760
have a lower impact on the environment than the plastic bag. We're left with a complex process

64
00:06:45,760 --> 00:06:50,800
of trade-offs. Everything has an impact somehow, and it's hard to find the right balance between

65
00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:56,080
them. Plastic also helps solve problems that we don't have very good answers for at the moment.

66
00:06:56,640 --> 00:07:01,840
Globally, one third of all food that's produced is never eaten and ends up rotting away on landfills,

67
00:07:01,840 --> 00:07:06,480
where it produces methane. And the best way of preventing food from spoiling and avoiding

68
00:07:06,480 --> 00:07:12,720
unnecessary waste is still plastic packaging. It's also important to note where the vast majority of

69
00:07:12,720 --> 00:07:18,480
the world's plastic pollution is coming from right now. 90% of all plastic waste entering the ocean

70
00:07:18,480 --> 00:07:25,920
through rivers comes from just 10 rivers in Asia and Africa. The Yangtze in China alone flushes 1.5

71
00:07:25,920 --> 00:07:31,680
million tons of plastic into the ocean each year. Countries like China, India, Algeria,

72
00:07:31,680 --> 00:07:37,440
or Indonesia industrialized at an impressive pace in the last few decades, transforming the lives

73
00:07:37,440 --> 00:07:42,880
of billions of people. This development was so fast that the garbage disposal infrastructure

74
00:07:42,880 --> 00:07:48,400
couldn't keep up with collecting and recycling all the new waste this brought. If politicians in

75
00:07:48,400 --> 00:07:53,040
Europe and the US want to address this issue, investing in infrastructure in developing

76
00:07:53,040 --> 00:07:58,000
countries is just as important as fighting plastic pollution at home with campaigns and

77
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:04,000
redesigning products to minimize unnecessary plastic production. The bottom line is, as long

78
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:08,480
as we don't address plastic pollution from a global perspective, we will not solve it.

79
00:08:09,280 --> 00:08:16,000
Plastic pollution is a complicated problem. We found a magic material and we had a really good

80
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:23,280
time with it. But we need to be careful, or just like Midas, we'll end up in a world that we didn't

81
00:08:23,280 --> 00:08:32,240
wish for. Your individual daily actions still have a huge impact. What you do matters. Refuse

82
00:08:32,240 --> 00:08:38,240
disposable plastics. Convince your friends and family to do the same. Pressure companies and

83
00:08:38,240 --> 00:08:44,560
politicians to take the necessary steps to keep our oceans clean and our food safe. Together,

84
00:08:44,560 --> 00:08:50,160
we can beat plastic pollution. This video was a collaboration with the UN Environment

85
00:08:50,160 --> 00:08:55,520
and their Clean Seas campaign. If you want to take action to turn the tide on plastics,

86
00:08:55,520 --> 00:09:01,200
go to cleanseas.org and make your pledge.
