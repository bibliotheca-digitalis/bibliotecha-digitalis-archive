720	6000	When the gods granted King Midas one wish, he wished that everything he touched would
6000	14560	turn to gold. Midas was delighted. Trees, rocks, buildings, all gold. But soon, he found in horror
14560	20000	that his food turned into gold as well. When he hugged his daughter to soothe his pain,
20000	28080	he realized his mistake too late. The richest man in existence was starving, heartbroken, and alone.
29040	35600	Humanity got a similar wish granted when we learned how to turn brown stinky goo into magic.
35600	44160	Plastic. Cheap, sterile, and convenient, it changed our lives. But this wonder of technology
44160	48960	got a little out of hand. Plastic has saturated our environment,
48960	55040	it has invaded the animals we eat, and now it's finding its way into our bodies.
58320	66320	What is plastic?
67360	71920	For most of our history, humans used stuff we found in nature to build the things we needed.
71920	78640	But the invention of plastic roughly 100 years ago completely changed our world. Plastic is made
78640	85360	from polymers, long repeating chains of molecule groups. In nature, polymers exist everywhere.
85360	94720	The walls of cells, silk, hair, insect carapaces, DNA. But it's also possible to create them.
95360	99600	By breaking down crude oil into its components and rearranging them,
99600	105680	we can form new synthetic polymers. Synthetic polymers have extraordinary traits.
105680	111280	They are lightweight, durable, and can be molded into almost any shape. Not requiring
111280	117040	time-consuming manual work, plastic can be easily mass-produced, and its raw materials
117040	123840	are available in vast amounts and incredibly cheaply. And so the golden era of plastics began.
124960	131040	Baker light was used for mechanical parts, PVC for plumbing, electric gears and cases,
131040	136720	acrylic as a shatter-resistant alternative to glass, and nylon for stockings and war equipment.
137440	143360	Today, almost everything is at least partly made from plastic. Our clothes, phones, computers,
143360	149600	furniture, appliances, houses, and cars. Plastic has long ceased to be a revolutionary material.
149600	155360	Instead, it became trash. Coffee cups, plastic bags, or stuff to wrap a banana.
155360	161920	We don't think about this fact a lot. Plastic just appears and goes away. Unfortunately, it doesn't.
161920	170080	Since synthetic polymers are so durable, plastic takes between 500 and 1,000 years to break down.
170880	175920	But somehow, we collectively decided to use this super-tough material for things
175920	183920	meant to be thrown away. 40% of plastics are used for packaging. In the US, packaging makes
183920	190320	up one-third of all the waste that is generated annually. Since its invention, we have produced
190320	200240	about 8.3 billion metric tons of plastic, 335 million tons in 2016 alone. More than 6.3 billion
200240	207120	metric tons of plastic have become waste since 1907. Piled up in one place, that makes a cube
207120	215280	with a side length of 1.9 kilometers. So, what did we do with all this waste? 9% was recycled,
215920	221120	12% burned, but 79% of it is sticking around still.
222560	226560	A lot ends up in the ocean, around 8 million tons a year.
227280	232640	That's so much plastic that it will outweigh all the fish in the ocean by 2050.
234000	238400	Because it's everywhere, marine animals keep getting trapped in plastic and swallowing it.
239040	243040	In 2015 already, 90% of seabirds had eaten plastic.
244000	248080	Many animals starve with stomachs full of indigestible trash.
248080	255520	In 2018, a dead sperm whale washed up in Spain. He had eaten 32 kilos of plastic bags, nets,
255520	262000	and a drum. While this is tragic and makes for great magazine covers, there's an even more
262000	266400	widespread, invisible form of plastic. Microplastics.
267600	273680	Microplastics are pieces smaller than 5 millimeters. Some of them are used in cosmetics
273680	280080	or toothpaste, but most result from floating waste that is constantly exposed to UV radiation
280080	286560	and crumbles into smaller and smaller pieces. 51 trillion such particles float in the ocean
286560	290240	where they are even more easily swallowed by all kinds of marine life.
291040	295680	This has raised concerns among scientists, especially about health risks from the chemicals
295680	301280	that are added to plastic. BPA, for example, makes plastic bottles transparent, but there's
301280	308160	also evidence that it interferes with our hormonal system. DEHP makes plastics more flexible but may
308160	314480	cause cancer. It would be pretty bad if microplastics are toxic because they travel up the
314480	321760	food chain. Zooplankton eat microplastic. Small fish eat zooplankton. So do oysters,
321760	329200	crabs, and predatory fish. And they all land on our plate. Microplastics have been found in honey,
329200	334320	in sea salt, in beer, in tap water, and in the household dust around us.
335200	340240	8 out of 10 babies and nearly all adults have measurable amounts of phthalates,
340240	346160	a common plastic additive in their bodies. And 93% of people have BPA in their urine.
346960	352480	There is little science about this so far, and right now it's inconclusive. We need a lot more
352480	357920	research before panic is justified. But it is safe to say that a lot of stuff happened that we
357920	363680	didn't plan for. And we have lost control over plastic to a certain extent, which is kind of
363680	370160	scary. But just to make sure, we should simply ban plastics, right? Unfortunately,
370160	375440	it's a bit more complicated than that. Plastic pollution is not the only environmental challenge
375440	380800	we face. Some of the substitutes we'd use for plastic have a higher environmental impact in
380800	386560	other ways. For example, according to a recent study by the Danish government, making a single
386560	392240	use plastic bag requires so little energy and produces far lower carbon dioxide emissions
392240	399520	compared to a reusable cotton bag that you need to use your cotton bag 7,100 times before it would
399520	405760	have a lower impact on the environment than the plastic bag. We're left with a complex process
405760	410800	of trade-offs. Everything has an impact somehow, and it's hard to find the right balance between
410800	416080	them. Plastic also helps solve problems that we don't have very good answers for at the moment.
416640	421840	Globally, one third of all food that's produced is never eaten and ends up rotting away on landfills,
421840	426480	where it produces methane. And the best way of preventing food from spoiling and avoiding
426480	432720	unnecessary waste is still plastic packaging. It's also important to note where the vast majority of
432720	438480	the world's plastic pollution is coming from right now. 90% of all plastic waste entering the ocean
438480	445920	through rivers comes from just 10 rivers in Asia and Africa. The Yangtze in China alone flushes 1.5
445920	451680	million tons of plastic into the ocean each year. Countries like China, India, Algeria,
451680	457440	or Indonesia industrialized at an impressive pace in the last few decades, transforming the lives
457440	462880	of billions of people. This development was so fast that the garbage disposal infrastructure
462880	468400	couldn't keep up with collecting and recycling all the new waste this brought. If politicians in
468400	473040	Europe and the US want to address this issue, investing in infrastructure in developing
473040	478000	countries is just as important as fighting plastic pollution at home with campaigns and
478000	484000	redesigning products to minimize unnecessary plastic production. The bottom line is, as long
484000	488480	as we don't address plastic pollution from a global perspective, we will not solve it.
489280	496000	Plastic pollution is a complicated problem. We found a magic material and we had a really good
496000	503280	time with it. But we need to be careful, or just like Midas, we'll end up in a world that we didn't
503280	512240	wish for. Your individual daily actions still have a huge impact. What you do matters. Refuse
512240	518240	disposable plastics. Convince your friends and family to do the same. Pressure companies and
518240	524560	politicians to take the necessary steps to keep our oceans clean and our food safe. Together,
524560	530160	we can beat plastic pollution. This video was a collaboration with the UN Environment
530160	535520	and their Clean Seas campaign. If you want to take action to turn the tide on plastics,
