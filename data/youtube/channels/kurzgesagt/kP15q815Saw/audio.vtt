00:00.000 --> 00:06.000
All around the world, marijuana is being decriminalized or even made legal.

00:06.000 --> 00:08.000
But is this really a good idea?

00:08.000 --> 00:12.000
In the online debate, the harmful sides are often downplayed.

00:12.000 --> 00:17.000
So let's look at the three most powerful arguments against legalizing marijuana.

00:25.000 --> 00:27.000
Argument number one.

00:27.000 --> 00:32.000
In the last few decades, marijuana has been engineered to become much more potent.

00:32.000 --> 00:38.000
Today, marijuana is so potent that it's actually a strong drug that may cause psychosis.

00:38.000 --> 00:48.000
The main active ingredient of marijuana is THC, and there's strong evidence that THC is related to psychosis, regardless of other risk factors.

00:48.000 --> 00:53.000
Marijuana also contains a substance called CBD that seems to counteract this effect.

00:53.000 --> 00:58.000
It's even being tested as a treatment against psychosis and anxiety.

00:58.000 --> 01:08.000
But because it doesn't make you high, growers have gradually decreased the amount of CBD in marijuana over the last few decades while increasing THC levels.

01:08.000 --> 01:16.000
Sample testing showed that THC levels have risen from around 4% in the 1990s to nearly 12% in 2014,

01:16.000 --> 01:24.000
shifting the ratio of THC to CBD from 1 to 14 in 1995 to about 1 to 80 in 2014.

01:24.000 --> 01:28.000
It's unclear how precise those tests were, however.

01:28.000 --> 01:37.000
Overall, recent findings suggest that the more marijuana you consume and the stronger it is, the higher your risk of developing psychosis.

01:37.000 --> 01:41.000
But how high is the risk of psychosis for the general population?

01:41.000 --> 01:48.000
A study from Britain found that while marijuana use has risen significantly between 1996 and 2005,

01:48.000 --> 01:53.000
the number of schizophrenia cases, a type of psychosis, remained stable.

01:53.000 --> 02:01.000
The risk of marijuana-induced psychosis remains the highest for people who already have a high risk of psychosis to begin with.

02:01.000 --> 02:09.000
For them, it seems more likely that marijuana speeds up the development of their condition rather than causing it, as far as we know right now.

02:09.000 --> 02:16.000
So the reasoning goes, if fewer people have access to marijuana, the lower the risk of marijuana-induced psychosis.

02:16.000 --> 02:24.000
But actually, you could argue that precisely because marijuana is illegal, more people will end up with psychosis.

02:24.000 --> 02:33.000
Prohibition makes illegal drugs stronger and more potent because this way you can ship more product in a smaller space and sell it at a greater profit.

02:33.000 --> 02:39.000
This is what happened during the prohibition of alcohol in the US, where hard liquor became the norm.

02:39.000 --> 02:42.000
And the same is happening with marijuana now.

02:42.000 --> 02:46.000
Imagine a world where liquor is the only alcohol available.

02:46.000 --> 02:51.000
You have the choice of either not drinking at all or getting much drunker than you would like to.

02:51.000 --> 02:55.000
This is the situation for many marijuana smokers today.

02:55.000 --> 03:02.000
People didn't stop drinking during prohibition and the numbers show that laws don't deter people from using marijuana.

03:02.000 --> 03:06.000
We can't make marijuana go away, but we can make it safer.

03:06.000 --> 03:15.000
If marijuana were legal, there would be more options for consumers and regulators could, for example, insist on a high level of CBD.

03:15.000 --> 03:24.000
Just like most people don't drink an after-work bottle of vodka, many people would gladly consume the after-work beer version of marijuana.

03:24.000 --> 03:28.000
Argument two, marijuana is a gateway drug.

03:28.000 --> 03:33.000
If it's legalized, there will be a spike in the use of much more dangerous drugs.

03:33.000 --> 03:42.000
A 2015 study found that about 45% of lifelong marijuana users took some other illegal drug at some point.

03:42.000 --> 03:45.000
Legalizing marijuana could reinforce this trend.

03:45.000 --> 03:50.000
As more young people try legal marijuana, they might end up trying harder drugs.

03:50.000 --> 03:56.000
But it turns out that the real gateway to drug use comes much earlier, cigarettes.

03:56.000 --> 04:05.000
One study showed that teens who started smoking before the age of 15 were 80% more likely to use illegal drugs than those who didn't.

04:05.000 --> 04:13.000
And a 2007 study found that teenagers between 12 and 17 who smoked were three times more likely to binge drink,

04:13.000 --> 04:17.000
seven times more likely to have used drugs like heroin or cocaine,

04:17.000 --> 04:21.000
and were also seven times more likely to resort to marijuana.

04:21.000 --> 04:28.000
But if that's the case, how could making more drugs legal stop the use of hard drugs?

04:28.000 --> 04:33.000
At first, it's important to acknowledge that people don't use drugs because they're legal or not.

04:33.000 --> 04:37.000
If you want to buy any drug, you'll always find someone happy to sell.

04:37.000 --> 04:43.000
The real question is why do people develop an unhealthy relationship with drugs at all?

04:43.000 --> 04:49.000
Studies show that certain conditions make people especially vulnerable to drugs and addiction.

04:49.000 --> 04:56.000
A difficult childhood, early trauma, low social status, depression, even genetic factors.

04:56.000 --> 05:02.000
Which drug they get addicted to is more often than not a matter of chance.

05:02.000 --> 05:10.000
Addicts take drugs to escape their problems, but drugs don't solve any of those problems and instead become a new problem.

05:10.000 --> 05:17.000
But punishing people for their unhealthy coping mechanisms doesn't change anything about the underlying causes either.

05:17.000 --> 05:21.000
So some argue we need to take a completely different route.

05:21.000 --> 05:29.000
In 2001, Portugal had one of the worst drug problems in Europe, so it was desperate enough to try something radical.

05:29.000 --> 05:34.000
Possession and use of all illegal drugs was decriminalized.

05:34.000 --> 05:39.000
You would no longer be arrested, instead, authorities launched a major health campaign.

05:39.000 --> 05:46.000
People who were found with a small amount were referred to support services and got help with treatment and harm reduction.

05:46.000 --> 05:50.000
Drug use was seen as a chronic disease, not a crime.

05:50.000 --> 05:52.000
The results were stunning.

05:52.000 --> 05:59.000
The number of people who tried drugs and kept using them fell from 44% to 28% by 2012.

05:59.000 --> 06:06.000
The use of hard drugs decreased, as well as HIV and hepatitis infections and overdoses.

06:06.000 --> 06:12.000
Making drugs legal might overall help society much more than it harms it.

06:12.000 --> 06:14.000
Argument number three.

06:14.000 --> 06:17.000
Marijuana is addictive and unhealthy.

06:17.000 --> 06:21.000
It needs to remain illegal to keep harm at a minimum.

06:21.000 --> 06:27.000
While marijuana addiction is more psychological than physical, it is still a real problem.

06:27.000 --> 06:33.000
The demand for treatment for marijuana addiction has more than doubled in the past decade alone.

06:33.000 --> 06:38.000
In total, about 10% of people who try marijuana will become addicted.

06:38.000 --> 06:41.000
This is also related to higher THC levels.

06:41.000 --> 06:48.000
A study released in 2017 tracked the potency of marijuana in Dutch coffee shops over a period of 16 years.

06:48.000 --> 06:55.000
For every 1% increase in THC, 60 more people entered treatment nationwide.

06:55.000 --> 07:01.000
In terms of negative health effects, some studies linked marijuana use to increased blood pressure and lung problems,

07:01.000 --> 07:09.000
while a 2016 study found that marijuana use was unrelated to physical health problems except for a higher risk of gum disease.

07:10.000 --> 07:16.000
Some studies showed that marijuana use alters teenagers' brains and decreases their intelligence,

07:16.000 --> 07:23.000
but when more recent studies took drinking and smoking into account, the results were inconclusive.

07:23.000 --> 07:29.000
Overall, research shows that taking any drugs while the brain is still in development is bad for you.

07:29.000 --> 07:34.000
But the truth is we don't know yet how unhealthy marijuana is.

07:34.000 --> 07:39.000
We need more funding for research, which is hard to get while marijuana remains illegal.

07:39.000 --> 07:42.000
We can put what we know into perspective, though.

07:42.000 --> 07:50.000
16% of people who consume alcohol become alcoholics and 32% of people who try cigarettes become smokers.

07:50.000 --> 07:55.000
We know for sure alcohol affects your brain, destroys your liver and causes cancer,

07:55.000 --> 08:01.000
while tobacco clogs your arteries, destroys your lungs and also causes cancer.

08:01.000 --> 08:08.000
3.3 million people die from alcohol abuse each year, while smoking kills more than 6 million people.

08:08.000 --> 08:13.000
Nobody is suggesting tobacco and alcohol are harmless just because they're legal.

08:13.000 --> 08:19.000
Also, nobody is seriously proposing to prohibit them, even though they are extremely dangerous.

08:19.000 --> 08:26.000
Legality is a way to exercise some control over them, especially when it comes to protecting young people.

08:26.000 --> 08:31.000
It's often much harder to buy legal drugs for teenagers than to buy illegal ones.

08:31.000 --> 08:37.000
Official sellers can get hefty fines and lose their license if they sell to underage kids.

08:37.000 --> 08:44.000
Legality creates incentives here that drug dealers can't exploit.

08:44.000 --> 08:51.000
So making marijuana legal doesn't mean endorsing it. It means taking responsibility for the risks it poses.

08:51.000 --> 08:59.000
It could also open the floodgates to tons of new research that shows us how harmful it really is and to whom.

08:59.000 --> 09:01.000
Conclusion

09:01.000 --> 09:09.000
Marijuana is a drug, and just like any other drug, it has negative consequences for a sizable portion of the people who use it.

09:09.000 --> 09:11.000
It is not harmless.

09:11.000 --> 09:20.000
The best way to protect society from its negative consequences seems to be legalization and regulation.
