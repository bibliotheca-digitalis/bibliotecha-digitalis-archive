0	6000	All around the world, marijuana is being decriminalized or even made legal.
6000	8000	But is this really a good idea?
8000	12000	In the online debate, the harmful sides are often downplayed.
12000	17000	So let's look at the three most powerful arguments against legalizing marijuana.
25000	27000	Argument number one.
27000	32000	In the last few decades, marijuana has been engineered to become much more potent.
32000	38000	Today, marijuana is so potent that it's actually a strong drug that may cause psychosis.
38000	48000	The main active ingredient of marijuana is THC, and there's strong evidence that THC is related to psychosis, regardless of other risk factors.
48000	53000	Marijuana also contains a substance called CBD that seems to counteract this effect.
53000	58000	It's even being tested as a treatment against psychosis and anxiety.
58000	68000	But because it doesn't make you high, growers have gradually decreased the amount of CBD in marijuana over the last few decades while increasing THC levels.
68000	76000	Sample testing showed that THC levels have risen from around 4% in the 1990s to nearly 12% in 2014,
76000	84000	shifting the ratio of THC to CBD from 1 to 14 in 1995 to about 1 to 80 in 2014.
84000	88000	It's unclear how precise those tests were, however.
88000	97000	Overall, recent findings suggest that the more marijuana you consume and the stronger it is, the higher your risk of developing psychosis.
97000	101000	But how high is the risk of psychosis for the general population?
101000	108000	A study from Britain found that while marijuana use has risen significantly between 1996 and 2005,
108000	113000	the number of schizophrenia cases, a type of psychosis, remained stable.
113000	121000	The risk of marijuana-induced psychosis remains the highest for people who already have a high risk of psychosis to begin with.
121000	129000	For them, it seems more likely that marijuana speeds up the development of their condition rather than causing it, as far as we know right now.
129000	136000	So the reasoning goes, if fewer people have access to marijuana, the lower the risk of marijuana-induced psychosis.
136000	144000	But actually, you could argue that precisely because marijuana is illegal, more people will end up with psychosis.
144000	153000	Prohibition makes illegal drugs stronger and more potent because this way you can ship more product in a smaller space and sell it at a greater profit.
153000	159000	This is what happened during the prohibition of alcohol in the US, where hard liquor became the norm.
159000	162000	And the same is happening with marijuana now.
162000	166000	Imagine a world where liquor is the only alcohol available.
166000	171000	You have the choice of either not drinking at all or getting much drunker than you would like to.
171000	175000	This is the situation for many marijuana smokers today.
175000	182000	People didn't stop drinking during prohibition and the numbers show that laws don't deter people from using marijuana.
182000	186000	We can't make marijuana go away, but we can make it safer.
186000	195000	If marijuana were legal, there would be more options for consumers and regulators could, for example, insist on a high level of CBD.
195000	204000	Just like most people don't drink an after-work bottle of vodka, many people would gladly consume the after-work beer version of marijuana.
204000	208000	Argument two, marijuana is a gateway drug.
208000	213000	If it's legalized, there will be a spike in the use of much more dangerous drugs.
213000	222000	A 2015 study found that about 45% of lifelong marijuana users took some other illegal drug at some point.
222000	225000	Legalizing marijuana could reinforce this trend.
225000	230000	As more young people try legal marijuana, they might end up trying harder drugs.
230000	236000	But it turns out that the real gateway to drug use comes much earlier, cigarettes.
236000	245000	One study showed that teens who started smoking before the age of 15 were 80% more likely to use illegal drugs than those who didn't.
245000	253000	And a 2007 study found that teenagers between 12 and 17 who smoked were three times more likely to binge drink,
253000	257000	seven times more likely to have used drugs like heroin or cocaine,
257000	261000	and were also seven times more likely to resort to marijuana.
261000	268000	But if that's the case, how could making more drugs legal stop the use of hard drugs?
268000	273000	At first, it's important to acknowledge that people don't use drugs because they're legal or not.
273000	277000	If you want to buy any drug, you'll always find someone happy to sell.
277000	283000	The real question is why do people develop an unhealthy relationship with drugs at all?
283000	289000	Studies show that certain conditions make people especially vulnerable to drugs and addiction.
289000	296000	A difficult childhood, early trauma, low social status, depression, even genetic factors.
296000	302000	Which drug they get addicted to is more often than not a matter of chance.
302000	310000	Addicts take drugs to escape their problems, but drugs don't solve any of those problems and instead become a new problem.
310000	317000	But punishing people for their unhealthy coping mechanisms doesn't change anything about the underlying causes either.
317000	321000	So some argue we need to take a completely different route.
321000	329000	In 2001, Portugal had one of the worst drug problems in Europe, so it was desperate enough to try something radical.
329000	334000	Possession and use of all illegal drugs was decriminalized.
334000	339000	You would no longer be arrested, instead, authorities launched a major health campaign.
339000	346000	People who were found with a small amount were referred to support services and got help with treatment and harm reduction.
346000	350000	Drug use was seen as a chronic disease, not a crime.
350000	352000	The results were stunning.
352000	359000	The number of people who tried drugs and kept using them fell from 44% to 28% by 2012.
359000	366000	The use of hard drugs decreased, as well as HIV and hepatitis infections and overdoses.
366000	372000	Making drugs legal might overall help society much more than it harms it.
372000	374000	Argument number three.
374000	377000	Marijuana is addictive and unhealthy.
377000	381000	It needs to remain illegal to keep harm at a minimum.
381000	387000	While marijuana addiction is more psychological than physical, it is still a real problem.
387000	393000	The demand for treatment for marijuana addiction has more than doubled in the past decade alone.
393000	398000	In total, about 10% of people who try marijuana will become addicted.
398000	401000	This is also related to higher THC levels.
401000	408000	A study released in 2017 tracked the potency of marijuana in Dutch coffee shops over a period of 16 years.
408000	415000	For every 1% increase in THC, 60 more people entered treatment nationwide.
415000	421000	In terms of negative health effects, some studies linked marijuana use to increased blood pressure and lung problems,
421000	429000	while a 2016 study found that marijuana use was unrelated to physical health problems except for a higher risk of gum disease.
430000	436000	Some studies showed that marijuana use alters teenagers' brains and decreases their intelligence,
436000	443000	but when more recent studies took drinking and smoking into account, the results were inconclusive.
443000	449000	Overall, research shows that taking any drugs while the brain is still in development is bad for you.
449000	454000	But the truth is we don't know yet how unhealthy marijuana is.
454000	459000	We need more funding for research, which is hard to get while marijuana remains illegal.
459000	462000	We can put what we know into perspective, though.
462000	470000	16% of people who consume alcohol become alcoholics and 32% of people who try cigarettes become smokers.
470000	475000	We know for sure alcohol affects your brain, destroys your liver and causes cancer,
475000	481000	while tobacco clogs your arteries, destroys your lungs and also causes cancer.
481000	488000	3.3 million people die from alcohol abuse each year, while smoking kills more than 6 million people.
488000	493000	Nobody is suggesting tobacco and alcohol are harmless just because they're legal.
493000	499000	Also, nobody is seriously proposing to prohibit them, even though they are extremely dangerous.
499000	506000	Legality is a way to exercise some control over them, especially when it comes to protecting young people.
506000	511000	It's often much harder to buy legal drugs for teenagers than to buy illegal ones.
511000	517000	Official sellers can get hefty fines and lose their license if they sell to underage kids.
517000	524000	Legality creates incentives here that drug dealers can't exploit.
524000	531000	So making marijuana legal doesn't mean endorsing it. It means taking responsibility for the risks it poses.
531000	539000	It could also open the floodgates to tons of new research that shows us how harmful it really is and to whom.
539000	541000	Conclusion
541000	549000	Marijuana is a drug, and just like any other drug, it has negative consequences for a sizable portion of the people who use it.
549000	551000	It is not harmless.
551000	560000	The best way to protect society from its negative consequences seems to be legalization and regulation.
