1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,000
All around the world, marijuana is being decriminalized or even made legal.

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:08,000
But is this really a good idea?

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:12,000
In the online debate, the harmful sides are often downplayed.

4
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:17,000
So let's look at the three most powerful arguments against legalizing marijuana.

5
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:27,000
Argument number one.

6
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:32,000
In the last few decades, marijuana has been engineered to become much more potent.

7
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:38,000
Today, marijuana is so potent that it's actually a strong drug that may cause psychosis.

8
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:48,000
The main active ingredient of marijuana is THC, and there's strong evidence that THC is related to psychosis, regardless of other risk factors.

9
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:53,000
Marijuana also contains a substance called CBD that seems to counteract this effect.

10
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:58,000
It's even being tested as a treatment against psychosis and anxiety.

11
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:08,000
But because it doesn't make you high, growers have gradually decreased the amount of CBD in marijuana over the last few decades while increasing THC levels.

12
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:16,000
Sample testing showed that THC levels have risen from around 4% in the 1990s to nearly 12% in 2014,

13
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:24,000
shifting the ratio of THC to CBD from 1 to 14 in 1995 to about 1 to 80 in 2014.

14
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:28,000
It's unclear how precise those tests were, however.

15
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:37,000
Overall, recent findings suggest that the more marijuana you consume and the stronger it is, the higher your risk of developing psychosis.

16
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:41,000
But how high is the risk of psychosis for the general population?

17
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:48,000
A study from Britain found that while marijuana use has risen significantly between 1996 and 2005,

18
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:53,000
the number of schizophrenia cases, a type of psychosis, remained stable.

19
00:01:53,000 --> 00:02:01,000
The risk of marijuana-induced psychosis remains the highest for people who already have a high risk of psychosis to begin with.

20
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:09,000
For them, it seems more likely that marijuana speeds up the development of their condition rather than causing it, as far as we know right now.

21
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:16,000
So the reasoning goes, if fewer people have access to marijuana, the lower the risk of marijuana-induced psychosis.

22
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:24,000
But actually, you could argue that precisely because marijuana is illegal, more people will end up with psychosis.

23
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:33,000
Prohibition makes illegal drugs stronger and more potent because this way you can ship more product in a smaller space and sell it at a greater profit.

24
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:39,000
This is what happened during the prohibition of alcohol in the US, where hard liquor became the norm.

25
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:42,000
And the same is happening with marijuana now.

26
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:46,000
Imagine a world where liquor is the only alcohol available.

27
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:51,000
You have the choice of either not drinking at all or getting much drunker than you would like to.

28
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:55,000
This is the situation for many marijuana smokers today.

29
00:02:55,000 --> 00:03:02,000
People didn't stop drinking during prohibition and the numbers show that laws don't deter people from using marijuana.

30
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:06,000
We can't make marijuana go away, but we can make it safer.

31
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:15,000
If marijuana were legal, there would be more options for consumers and regulators could, for example, insist on a high level of CBD.

32
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:24,000
Just like most people don't drink an after-work bottle of vodka, many people would gladly consume the after-work beer version of marijuana.

33
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:28,000
Argument two, marijuana is a gateway drug.

34
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:33,000
If it's legalized, there will be a spike in the use of much more dangerous drugs.

35
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:42,000
A 2015 study found that about 45% of lifelong marijuana users took some other illegal drug at some point.

36
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:45,000
Legalizing marijuana could reinforce this trend.

37
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:50,000
As more young people try legal marijuana, they might end up trying harder drugs.

38
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:56,000
But it turns out that the real gateway to drug use comes much earlier, cigarettes.

39
00:03:56,000 --> 00:04:05,000
One study showed that teens who started smoking before the age of 15 were 80% more likely to use illegal drugs than those who didn't.

40
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:13,000
And a 2007 study found that teenagers between 12 and 17 who smoked were three times more likely to binge drink,

41
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:17,000
seven times more likely to have used drugs like heroin or cocaine,

42
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:21,000
and were also seven times more likely to resort to marijuana.

43
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:28,000
But if that's the case, how could making more drugs legal stop the use of hard drugs?

44
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:33,000
At first, it's important to acknowledge that people don't use drugs because they're legal or not.

45
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:37,000
If you want to buy any drug, you'll always find someone happy to sell.

46
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:43,000
The real question is why do people develop an unhealthy relationship with drugs at all?

47
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:49,000
Studies show that certain conditions make people especially vulnerable to drugs and addiction.

48
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:56,000
A difficult childhood, early trauma, low social status, depression, even genetic factors.

49
00:04:56,000 --> 00:05:02,000
Which drug they get addicted to is more often than not a matter of chance.

50
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:10,000
Addicts take drugs to escape their problems, but drugs don't solve any of those problems and instead become a new problem.

51
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:17,000
But punishing people for their unhealthy coping mechanisms doesn't change anything about the underlying causes either.

52
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:21,000
So some argue we need to take a completely different route.

53
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:29,000
In 2001, Portugal had one of the worst drug problems in Europe, so it was desperate enough to try something radical.

54
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:34,000
Possession and use of all illegal drugs was decriminalized.

55
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:39,000
You would no longer be arrested, instead, authorities launched a major health campaign.

56
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:46,000
People who were found with a small amount were referred to support services and got help with treatment and harm reduction.

57
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:50,000
Drug use was seen as a chronic disease, not a crime.

58
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:52,000
The results were stunning.

59
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:59,000
The number of people who tried drugs and kept using them fell from 44% to 28% by 2012.

60
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:06,000
The use of hard drugs decreased, as well as HIV and hepatitis infections and overdoses.

61
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:12,000
Making drugs legal might overall help society much more than it harms it.

62
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:14,000
Argument number three.

63
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:17,000
Marijuana is addictive and unhealthy.

64
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:21,000
It needs to remain illegal to keep harm at a minimum.

65
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:27,000
While marijuana addiction is more psychological than physical, it is still a real problem.

66
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:33,000
The demand for treatment for marijuana addiction has more than doubled in the past decade alone.

67
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:38,000
In total, about 10% of people who try marijuana will become addicted.

68
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:41,000
This is also related to higher THC levels.

69
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:48,000
A study released in 2017 tracked the potency of marijuana in Dutch coffee shops over a period of 16 years.

70
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:55,000
For every 1% increase in THC, 60 more people entered treatment nationwide.

71
00:06:55,000 --> 00:07:01,000
In terms of negative health effects, some studies linked marijuana use to increased blood pressure and lung problems,

72
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:09,000
while a 2016 study found that marijuana use was unrelated to physical health problems except for a higher risk of gum disease.

73
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:16,000
Some studies showed that marijuana use alters teenagers' brains and decreases their intelligence,

74
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:23,000
but when more recent studies took drinking and smoking into account, the results were inconclusive.

75
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:29,000
Overall, research shows that taking any drugs while the brain is still in development is bad for you.

76
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:34,000
But the truth is we don't know yet how unhealthy marijuana is.

77
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:39,000
We need more funding for research, which is hard to get while marijuana remains illegal.

78
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:42,000
We can put what we know into perspective, though.

79
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:50,000
16% of people who consume alcohol become alcoholics and 32% of people who try cigarettes become smokers.

80
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:55,000
We know for sure alcohol affects your brain, destroys your liver and causes cancer,

81
00:07:55,000 --> 00:08:01,000
while tobacco clogs your arteries, destroys your lungs and also causes cancer.

82
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:08,000
3.3 million people die from alcohol abuse each year, while smoking kills more than 6 million people.

83
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:13,000
Nobody is suggesting tobacco and alcohol are harmless just because they're legal.

84
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:19,000
Also, nobody is seriously proposing to prohibit them, even though they are extremely dangerous.

85
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:26,000
Legality is a way to exercise some control over them, especially when it comes to protecting young people.

86
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:31,000
It's often much harder to buy legal drugs for teenagers than to buy illegal ones.

87
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:37,000
Official sellers can get hefty fines and lose their license if they sell to underage kids.

88
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:44,000
Legality creates incentives here that drug dealers can't exploit.

89
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:51,000
So making marijuana legal doesn't mean endorsing it. It means taking responsibility for the risks it poses.

90
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:59,000
It could also open the floodgates to tons of new research that shows us how harmful it really is and to whom.

91
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:01,000
Conclusion

92
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:09,000
Marijuana is a drug, and just like any other drug, it has negative consequences for a sizable portion of the people who use it.

93
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:11,000
It is not harmless.

94
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:20,000
The best way to protect society from its negative consequences seems to be legalization and regulation.
