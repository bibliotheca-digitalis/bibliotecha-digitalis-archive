0	6420	Imagine a future where your toaster anticipates what kind of toast you want.
6420	10940	During the day, it scans the internet for new and exciting types of toast.
10940	16540	Maybe it asks you about your day and wants to chat about new achievements in toast technology.
16540	22260	At what level would it become a person? At which point will you ask yourself if your
22260	28500	toaster has feelings? If it did, would unplugging it be murder? And would you still own it?
29460	32580	Will we someday be forced to give our machines rights?
43140	48340	AI is already all around you. It makes sure discounters are stocked with enough snacks,
48340	50580	it serves you up just the right internet ad,
50580	54180	and you may have even read a news story written entirely by a machine.
55140	60180	Right now, we look at chatbots like Siri and laugh at their primitive simulated emotions,
61060	65540	but it's likely that we will have to deal with beings that make it hard to draw the line between
65540	71700	real and simulated humanity. Are there any machines in existence that deserve rights?
72420	77380	Most likely, not yet. But if they come, we are not prepared for it.
78420	83060	Much of the philosophy of rights is ill-equipped to deal with the case of artificial intelligence.
83700	89060	Most claims for rights, whether human or animal, are centered around the question of consciousness.
89780	95380	Unfortunately, nobody knows what consciousness is. Some think that it's immaterial, others say
95380	101220	it's a state of matter like gas or liquid. Regardless of the precise definition,
101220	105140	we have an intuitive knowledge of consciousness because we experience it.
105780	110580	We are aware of ourselves and our surroundings and know what unconsciousness feels like.
111540	117860	Some neuroscientists believe that any sufficiently advanced system can generate consciousness. So,
117860	123700	if your toaster's hardware was powerful enough, it may become self-aware. If it does,
123700	130500	would it deserve rights? Well, not so fast. Would what we define as rights make sense to it?
131700	136420	Consciousness entitles beings to have rights because it gives a being the ability to suffer.
137060	143700	It means the ability to not only feel pain, but to be aware of it. Robots don't suffer,
143700	150260	and they probably won't unless we program them to. Without pain or pleasure, there's no preference,
150260	156420	and rights are meaningless. Our human rights are deeply tied to our own programming.
157140	161540	For example, we dislike pain because our brains evolved to keep us alive,
161540	165780	to stop us from touching a hot fire or to make us run away from predators.
166500	170580	So we came up with rights that protect us from infringements that cause us pain.
171620	175940	Even more abstract rights like freedom are rooted in the way our brains are
175940	182420	wired to detect what is fair and unfair. Would a toaster that is unable to move
182420	187940	mind being locked in a cage? Would it mind being dismantled if it had no fear of death?
188820	192500	Would it mind being insulted if it had no need for self-esteem?
192500	199700	But what if we programmed a robot to feel pain and emotions? To prefer justice over injustice,
199700	204260	pleasure over pain, and be aware of it? Would that make them sufficiently human?
205140	209140	Many technologists believe that an explosion in technology will occur
209140	214100	when artificial intelligence can learn and create their own artificial intelligences
214100	219940	even smarter than themselves. At this point, the question of how robots are programmed will be
219940	224340	largely out of our control. What if an artificial intelligence
224340	229140	found it necessary to program the ability to feel pain, just as evolutionary biology
229140	233940	found it necessary in most living creatures? Do robots deserve those rights?
235300	239620	But maybe we should be less worried about the risk that super-intelligent robots pose to us
239620	242020	and more worried about the danger we pose to them.
242900	247300	Our whole human identity is based on the idea of human exceptionalism,
247300	251620	that we are special, unique snowflakes entitled to dominate the natural world.
252820	257060	Humans have a history of denying that other beings are capable of suffering as they do.
257700	259860	In the midst of the Scientific Revolution,
259860	264100	Rene Descartes argued that animals were mere automata, robots if you will.
264900	269620	As such, injuring a rabbit was about as morally repugnant as punching a stuffed animal.
270260	275460	And many of the greatest crimes against humanity were justified by their perpetrators on the
275460	278660	grounds that the victims were more animal than civilized human.
280020	284660	Even more problematic is that we have an economic interest in denying robot rights.
285300	290900	If we can coerce a sentient AI, possibly through programmed torture, into doing as we please,
290900	295380	the economic potential is unlimited. We've done it before, after all.
296180	299620	Violence has been used to force our fellow humans into working,
299620	303300	and we've never had trouble coming up with ideological justifications.
303940	307300	Slave owners argued that slavery benefited the slaves.
307860	310420	It put a roof over their head and taught them Christianity.
311300	315300	Men who were against women voting argued that it was in women's own interest
315300	317140	to leave the hard decisions to men.
318580	321620	Farmers argued that looking after animals and feeding them
321620	324660	justifies their early death for our dietary preferences.
326980	331540	If robots become sentient, there will be no shortage of arguments for those who say that
332180	336260	they should remain without rights, especially from those who stand to profit from it.
337700	341940	Artificial intelligence raises serious questions about philosophical boundaries.
342660	346740	While we may ask if sentient robots are conscious or deserving of rights,
346740	352900	it forces us to pose basic questions like what makes us human? What makes us deserving of rights?
354740	358820	Regardless of what we think, the question might need to be resolved in the near future.
359540	362980	What are we going to do if robots start demanding their own rights?
367220	370100	What can robots demanding rights teach us about ourselves?
370660	374100	Our friends at Wisecrack made a video exploring this very question
374100	375860	using the philosophy of Westworld.
