0	5000	Humans dream about leaving Earth and traveling through the galaxy.
5000	8000	But we were born too early to be part of it.
8000	10000	Or were we?
10000	15000	The reality is, we could begin our dream by building a moon base today.
15000	20000	We actually do have the technology, and current estimates from NASA and the private sector
20000	26000	say it could be done for 20 to 40 billion dollars spread out over about a decade.
26000	33000	The price is comparable to the International Space Station or the budget surplus of Germany in 2017.
33000	36000	Not that big an investment, really.
36000	38000	The payoff would be immeasurable.
38000	44000	The moon is a sandbox to develop new technologies and exploit unlimited resources.
44000	51000	It would start a new space race and lay the foundation for us to spread out into the solar system and beyond.
51000	55000	It would create a vast array of new technologies to benefit us on Earth.
55000	57000	And we would all be part of it.
57000	59000	So, why aren't we doing it?
59000	66000	Well, sadly, it's hard to get governments interested in long-term investments in the future of humanity.
66000	69000	Let's imagine just doing it.
69000	73000	If we start today, how would we build a moon base?
73000	86000	Throughout history, colonization happened in phases.
86000	90000	In the first phase of the age of exploration of the New World, for example,
90000	96000	European monarchs funded expeditions to chart and discover and to stake their claims.
96000	100000	They planted a flag and set up a camp, but they didn't stay.
100000	105000	In the second phase, small missions set up outposts and settlements were founded,
105000	109000	which were still very dependent on their home countries for supplies.
109000	113000	Some failed, but others survived and established a permanent presence.
113000	119000	Only then, in the third phase, did a true colony form to which tradesmen and laborers could emigrate,
119000	123000	creating new wealth and opportunities for themselves and their families,
123000	127000	sending extreme wealth back to their countries of origin.
128000	132000	When we colonize the moon, we'll go through the same three phases,
132000	137000	this time without murdering millions of innocent people in the process.
137000	140000	The moon is not a welcoming place for living things.
140000	148000	A moon day lasts 29 Earth days, with a difference of nearly 300 degrees Celsius between sunlight and shade.
148000	154000	There's no atmosphere to shield us from meteorites, big and small, or cosmic radiation.
154000	159000	Worse still, the lunar surface is covered in a layer of nasty jagged dust.
159000	163000	The moon is hard, but we're good at doing hard things.
163000	170000	In the first phase of lunar colonization, our explorers proved it can be done, that a new world can be reached.
170000	173000	This phase started 60 years ago with the Apollo missions.
173000	178000	Since then, satellites like the American Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter have mapped the moon,
178000	182000	while rovers like the Chinese Yutu have studied the composition of the lunar surface,
182000	185000	looking for water ice and metals.
185000	187000	Phase one is more or less complete.
187000	190000	We know what we need to know to enter phase two.
190000	196000	In the second phase, astronauts will build the first moon base, and this could begin today.
196000	200000	The first small moon base could be completed in a decade.
200000	207000	The first nation that establishes this base will be akin to the first nation's building outposts in the New World 500 years ago.
207000	213000	It's expensive to send rockets to the moon, so we will send as little as possible.
213000	218000	The base will be light, little more than inflatable habitats for crews of no more than 12,
218000	221000	and will be deployed somewhere with a natural shelter.
221000	229000	Options include caves, like underground lava tube tunnels, or craters near the poles where the days are six months long.
229000	232000	These astronauts will not stay long.
232000	235000	The habitat is likely to be abandoned between missions,
235000	239000	as solar panels cannot generate electricity during the lunar night.
239000	243000	But they'll do the groundwork to enable humans to stay permanently.
243000	248000	Our first crew will consist of scientists and engineers who will study the composition of the moon
248000	253000	and whose experiments will explore ways of using the available lunar material,
253000	257000	say, purifying lunar ice and turning it into water for human use.
257000	260000	And water is important for far more than drinking.
260000	264000	They can use it to experiment with growing plants for food.
264000	269000	Hydrogen fuel cells will store power through the long night, extending astronaut stays.
269000	275000	And most importantly, it can be split into hydrogen and oxygen, rocket fuel.
277000	280000	By harvesting water from the moon and putting it into orbit,
280000	287000	the moon base will supply an orbital depot where scientific missions to Mars and the outer solar system can refuel.
288000	294000	Compared to the Earth, it's much easier and cheaper to get things off the moon into orbit.
294000	298000	Colonizing Mars may mean starting from the moon.
298000	302000	But this isn't a true colony. Not yet.
302000	305000	The base will be abandoned if funding stops.
305000	309000	If we want our base to grow into the third phase, into a true colony,
309000	314000	it must become self-sufficient, supporting itself via exports to Earth.
314000	320000	Now, private contractors arrive, looking to get rich off lunar resources and support services.
320000	325000	If it's cheaper to produce rocket fuel in space, what else can they get rich on?
325000	332000	They could extract precious metals, abundant in impact craters and other raw materials from the lunar regolith.
332000	336000	One promising possibility is the mining of helium-3,
336000	340000	an isotope that could one day be used in nuclear fusion reactors,
340000	345000	something the Chinese Lunar Exploration Program is currently looking into.
345000	352000	Future colonists may export helium-3 back to Earth, providing us with cheap and clean fusion energy.
352000	356000	Asteroids could be pulled into the moon's orbit and mined.
356000	364000	With commercial exports to Earth, the colony is fully in its third phase, self-sufficient and economically productive.
364000	369000	Our base will begin using lunar material in its construction projects if it's to continue growing.
369000	374000	Fortunately, lunar soil has all the necessary ingredients to make concrete.
374000	378000	Robotic mining rigs can sift the lunar dust for organic molecules
378000	383000	and could be used to build huge structures way too massive to be brought from Earth,
383000	390000	while advances in 3D printing will make it possible to produce almost everything else the crews need.
390000	395000	It's hard to say when exactly the colony becomes self-sustaining.
395000	399000	Growth is gradual, experiments are replaced by industry,
399000	404000	and the population steadily reaches the hundreds, encompassing more than just scientists.
404000	410000	Engineers, pilots and contractors representing countries and corporations will be present.
410000	416000	Two of these people will make a breakthrough, not scientific, but social.
416000	419000	They will have the first extraterrestrial child.
420000	428000	Throughout history, the birth of the first child was celebrated as a moment where the seed of a colony finally and irreversibly took root.
428000	432000	Here, it means that the moon is not just a place for scientists and engineers to work,
432000	436000	it's a place for people to live, to raise a family.
436000	440000	Once this transition happens, the colony grows rapidly,
440000	446000	building more habitats and schools and farms and all the things needed to support the growing population.
446000	452000	As our colony grows, all kinds of new technologies will be invented to sustain it.
452000	458000	They might develop crops that efficiently recycle carbon dioxide or that grow with very little water.
458000	466000	They might find ways to recycle and reuse 100% of their waste, technologies that are extremely valuable for Earth.
466000	470000	They could even build the first space elevator in the solar system.
470000	479000	With a space elevator, spacecraft, astronauts and raw materials could be brought back and forth from lunar orbit without needing to use rockets at all.
479000	485000	The moon may become a hub for economic activity on a scale that's hard to imagine right now.
485000	489000	It's hard to say who will own the colony at this point.
489000	493000	Will the first person born on the moon take the national identity of their parents,
493000	498000	or will a new generation melt together into a new lunar society?
498000	507000	And when existing treaties that bar any nation from owning the moon are inevitably rewritten, will the colonists be given a say?
507000	511000	Will they declare independence from the Earth?
511000	517000	However it happens, the moon is a perfect sandbox to learn how to colonize the solar system,
517000	525000	the perfect project to unify nations, and the only way to guarantee our survival as a species should something tragic happen on Earth.
525000	530000	If we ever want to colonize the Milky Way, we'll have to start somewhere.
530000	534000	So why not start there? Why not start now?
538000	548000	While unfortunately you can't jump on a spacecraft and go to the moon right now, you can learn more interesting things about space and our universe.
548000	550000	And we can even help you with that.
