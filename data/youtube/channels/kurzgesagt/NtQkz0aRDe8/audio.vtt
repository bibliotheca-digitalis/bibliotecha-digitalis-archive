00:00.000 --> 00:05.000
Humans dream about leaving Earth and traveling through the galaxy.

00:05.000 --> 00:08.000
But we were born too early to be part of it.

00:08.000 --> 00:10.000
Or were we?

00:10.000 --> 00:15.000
The reality is, we could begin our dream by building a moon base today.

00:15.000 --> 00:20.000
We actually do have the technology, and current estimates from NASA and the private sector

00:20.000 --> 00:26.000
say it could be done for 20 to 40 billion dollars spread out over about a decade.

00:26.000 --> 00:33.000
The price is comparable to the International Space Station or the budget surplus of Germany in 2017.

00:33.000 --> 00:36.000
Not that big an investment, really.

00:36.000 --> 00:38.000
The payoff would be immeasurable.

00:38.000 --> 00:44.000
The moon is a sandbox to develop new technologies and exploit unlimited resources.

00:44.000 --> 00:51.000
It would start a new space race and lay the foundation for us to spread out into the solar system and beyond.

00:51.000 --> 00:55.000
It would create a vast array of new technologies to benefit us on Earth.

00:55.000 --> 00:57.000
And we would all be part of it.

00:57.000 --> 00:59.000
So, why aren't we doing it?

00:59.000 --> 01:06.000
Well, sadly, it's hard to get governments interested in long-term investments in the future of humanity.

01:06.000 --> 01:09.000
Let's imagine just doing it.

01:09.000 --> 01:13.000
If we start today, how would we build a moon base?

01:13.000 --> 01:26.000
Throughout history, colonization happened in phases.

01:26.000 --> 01:30.000
In the first phase of the age of exploration of the New World, for example,

01:30.000 --> 01:36.000
European monarchs funded expeditions to chart and discover and to stake their claims.

01:36.000 --> 01:40.000
They planted a flag and set up a camp, but they didn't stay.

01:40.000 --> 01:45.000
In the second phase, small missions set up outposts and settlements were founded,

01:45.000 --> 01:49.000
which were still very dependent on their home countries for supplies.

01:49.000 --> 01:53.000
Some failed, but others survived and established a permanent presence.

01:53.000 --> 01:59.000
Only then, in the third phase, did a true colony form to which tradesmen and laborers could emigrate,

01:59.000 --> 02:03.000
creating new wealth and opportunities for themselves and their families,

02:03.000 --> 02:07.000
sending extreme wealth back to their countries of origin.

02:08.000 --> 02:12.000
When we colonize the moon, we'll go through the same three phases,

02:12.000 --> 02:17.000
this time without murdering millions of innocent people in the process.

02:17.000 --> 02:20.000
The moon is not a welcoming place for living things.

02:20.000 --> 02:28.000
A moon day lasts 29 Earth days, with a difference of nearly 300 degrees Celsius between sunlight and shade.

02:28.000 --> 02:34.000
There's no atmosphere to shield us from meteorites, big and small, or cosmic radiation.

02:34.000 --> 02:39.000
Worse still, the lunar surface is covered in a layer of nasty jagged dust.

02:39.000 --> 02:43.000
The moon is hard, but we're good at doing hard things.

02:43.000 --> 02:50.000
In the first phase of lunar colonization, our explorers proved it can be done, that a new world can be reached.

02:50.000 --> 02:53.000
This phase started 60 years ago with the Apollo missions.

02:53.000 --> 02:58.000
Since then, satellites like the American Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter have mapped the moon,

02:58.000 --> 03:02.000
while rovers like the Chinese Yutu have studied the composition of the lunar surface,

03:02.000 --> 03:05.000
looking for water ice and metals.

03:05.000 --> 03:07.000
Phase one is more or less complete.

03:07.000 --> 03:10.000
We know what we need to know to enter phase two.

03:10.000 --> 03:16.000
In the second phase, astronauts will build the first moon base, and this could begin today.

03:16.000 --> 03:20.000
The first small moon base could be completed in a decade.

03:20.000 --> 03:27.000
The first nation that establishes this base will be akin to the first nation's building outposts in the New World 500 years ago.

03:27.000 --> 03:33.000
It's expensive to send rockets to the moon, so we will send as little as possible.

03:33.000 --> 03:38.000
The base will be light, little more than inflatable habitats for crews of no more than 12,

03:38.000 --> 03:41.000
and will be deployed somewhere with a natural shelter.

03:41.000 --> 03:49.000
Options include caves, like underground lava tube tunnels, or craters near the poles where the days are six months long.

03:49.000 --> 03:52.000
These astronauts will not stay long.

03:52.000 --> 03:55.000
The habitat is likely to be abandoned between missions,

03:55.000 --> 03:59.000
as solar panels cannot generate electricity during the lunar night.

03:59.000 --> 04:03.000
But they'll do the groundwork to enable humans to stay permanently.

04:03.000 --> 04:08.000
Our first crew will consist of scientists and engineers who will study the composition of the moon

04:08.000 --> 04:13.000
and whose experiments will explore ways of using the available lunar material,

04:13.000 --> 04:17.000
say, purifying lunar ice and turning it into water for human use.

04:17.000 --> 04:20.000
And water is important for far more than drinking.

04:20.000 --> 04:24.000
They can use it to experiment with growing plants for food.

04:24.000 --> 04:29.000
Hydrogen fuel cells will store power through the long night, extending astronaut stays.

04:29.000 --> 04:35.000
And most importantly, it can be split into hydrogen and oxygen, rocket fuel.

04:37.000 --> 04:40.000
By harvesting water from the moon and putting it into orbit,

04:40.000 --> 04:47.000
the moon base will supply an orbital depot where scientific missions to Mars and the outer solar system can refuel.

04:48.000 --> 04:54.000
Compared to the Earth, it's much easier and cheaper to get things off the moon into orbit.

04:54.000 --> 04:58.000
Colonizing Mars may mean starting from the moon.

04:58.000 --> 05:02.000
But this isn't a true colony. Not yet.

05:02.000 --> 05:05.000
The base will be abandoned if funding stops.

05:05.000 --> 05:09.000
If we want our base to grow into the third phase, into a true colony,

05:09.000 --> 05:14.000
it must become self-sufficient, supporting itself via exports to Earth.

05:14.000 --> 05:20.000
Now, private contractors arrive, looking to get rich off lunar resources and support services.

05:20.000 --> 05:25.000
If it's cheaper to produce rocket fuel in space, what else can they get rich on?

05:25.000 --> 05:32.000
They could extract precious metals, abundant in impact craters and other raw materials from the lunar regolith.

05:32.000 --> 05:36.000
One promising possibility is the mining of helium-3,

05:36.000 --> 05:40.000
an isotope that could one day be used in nuclear fusion reactors,

05:40.000 --> 05:45.000
something the Chinese Lunar Exploration Program is currently looking into.

05:45.000 --> 05:52.000
Future colonists may export helium-3 back to Earth, providing us with cheap and clean fusion energy.

05:52.000 --> 05:56.000
Asteroids could be pulled into the moon's orbit and mined.

05:56.000 --> 06:04.000
With commercial exports to Earth, the colony is fully in its third phase, self-sufficient and economically productive.

06:04.000 --> 06:09.000
Our base will begin using lunar material in its construction projects if it's to continue growing.

06:09.000 --> 06:14.000
Fortunately, lunar soil has all the necessary ingredients to make concrete.

06:14.000 --> 06:18.000
Robotic mining rigs can sift the lunar dust for organic molecules

06:18.000 --> 06:23.000
and could be used to build huge structures way too massive to be brought from Earth,

06:23.000 --> 06:30.000
while advances in 3D printing will make it possible to produce almost everything else the crews need.

06:30.000 --> 06:35.000
It's hard to say when exactly the colony becomes self-sustaining.

06:35.000 --> 06:39.000
Growth is gradual, experiments are replaced by industry,

06:39.000 --> 06:44.000
and the population steadily reaches the hundreds, encompassing more than just scientists.

06:44.000 --> 06:50.000
Engineers, pilots and contractors representing countries and corporations will be present.

06:50.000 --> 06:56.000
Two of these people will make a breakthrough, not scientific, but social.

06:56.000 --> 06:59.000
They will have the first extraterrestrial child.

07:00.000 --> 07:08.000
Throughout history, the birth of the first child was celebrated as a moment where the seed of a colony finally and irreversibly took root.

07:08.000 --> 07:12.000
Here, it means that the moon is not just a place for scientists and engineers to work,

07:12.000 --> 07:16.000
it's a place for people to live, to raise a family.

07:16.000 --> 07:20.000
Once this transition happens, the colony grows rapidly,

07:20.000 --> 07:26.000
building more habitats and schools and farms and all the things needed to support the growing population.

07:26.000 --> 07:32.000
As our colony grows, all kinds of new technologies will be invented to sustain it.

07:32.000 --> 07:38.000
They might develop crops that efficiently recycle carbon dioxide or that grow with very little water.

07:38.000 --> 07:46.000
They might find ways to recycle and reuse 100% of their waste, technologies that are extremely valuable for Earth.

07:46.000 --> 07:50.000
They could even build the first space elevator in the solar system.

07:50.000 --> 07:59.000
With a space elevator, spacecraft, astronauts and raw materials could be brought back and forth from lunar orbit without needing to use rockets at all.

07:59.000 --> 08:05.000
The moon may become a hub for economic activity on a scale that's hard to imagine right now.

08:05.000 --> 08:09.000
It's hard to say who will own the colony at this point.

08:09.000 --> 08:13.000
Will the first person born on the moon take the national identity of their parents,

08:13.000 --> 08:18.000
or will a new generation melt together into a new lunar society?

08:18.000 --> 08:27.000
And when existing treaties that bar any nation from owning the moon are inevitably rewritten, will the colonists be given a say?

08:27.000 --> 08:31.000
Will they declare independence from the Earth?

08:31.000 --> 08:37.000
However it happens, the moon is a perfect sandbox to learn how to colonize the solar system,

08:37.000 --> 08:45.000
the perfect project to unify nations, and the only way to guarantee our survival as a species should something tragic happen on Earth.

08:45.000 --> 08:50.000
If we ever want to colonize the Milky Way, we'll have to start somewhere.

08:50.000 --> 08:54.000
So why not start there? Why not start now?

08:58.000 --> 09:08.000
While unfortunately you can't jump on a spacecraft and go to the moon right now, you can learn more interesting things about space and our universe.

09:08.000 --> 09:10.000
And we can even help you with that.

09:10.000 --> 09:17.000
Kurzgesagt and Brilliant are collaborating on a six-part video series about our favorite science and space topics.

09:17.000 --> 09:21.000
Kurzgesagt has worked with Brilliant for a while now, and we love what they're doing.

09:21.000 --> 09:25.000
In a nutshell, Brilliant teaches you science and maths with a hands-on approach.

09:25.000 --> 09:31.000
