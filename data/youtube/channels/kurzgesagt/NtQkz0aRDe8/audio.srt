1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
Humans dream about leaving Earth and traveling through the galaxy.

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:08,000
But we were born too early to be part of it.

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:10,000
Or were we?

4
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:15,000
The reality is, we could begin our dream by building a moon base today.

5
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:20,000
We actually do have the technology, and current estimates from NASA and the private sector

6
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:26,000
say it could be done for 20 to 40 billion dollars spread out over about a decade.

7
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:33,000
The price is comparable to the International Space Station or the budget surplus of Germany in 2017.

8
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:36,000
Not that big an investment, really.

9
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,000
The payoff would be immeasurable.

10
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:44,000
The moon is a sandbox to develop new technologies and exploit unlimited resources.

11
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:51,000
It would start a new space race and lay the foundation for us to spread out into the solar system and beyond.

12
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:55,000
It would create a vast array of new technologies to benefit us on Earth.

13
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:57,000
And we would all be part of it.

14
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:59,000
So, why aren't we doing it?

15
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:06,000
Well, sadly, it's hard to get governments interested in long-term investments in the future of humanity.

16
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:09,000
Let's imagine just doing it.

17
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:13,000
If we start today, how would we build a moon base?

18
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:26,000
Throughout history, colonization happened in phases.

19
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:30,000
In the first phase of the age of exploration of the New World, for example,

20
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:36,000
European monarchs funded expeditions to chart and discover and to stake their claims.

21
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:40,000
They planted a flag and set up a camp, but they didn't stay.

22
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:45,000
In the second phase, small missions set up outposts and settlements were founded,

23
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:49,000
which were still very dependent on their home countries for supplies.

24
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:53,000
Some failed, but others survived and established a permanent presence.

25
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:59,000
Only then, in the third phase, did a true colony form to which tradesmen and laborers could emigrate,

26
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:03,000
creating new wealth and opportunities for themselves and their families,

27
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:07,000
sending extreme wealth back to their countries of origin.

28
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:12,000
When we colonize the moon, we'll go through the same three phases,

29
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:17,000
this time without murdering millions of innocent people in the process.

30
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:20,000
The moon is not a welcoming place for living things.

31
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:28,000
A moon day lasts 29 Earth days, with a difference of nearly 300 degrees Celsius between sunlight and shade.

32
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:34,000
There's no atmosphere to shield us from meteorites, big and small, or cosmic radiation.

33
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:39,000
Worse still, the lunar surface is covered in a layer of nasty jagged dust.

34
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:43,000
The moon is hard, but we're good at doing hard things.

35
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:50,000
In the first phase of lunar colonization, our explorers proved it can be done, that a new world can be reached.

36
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:53,000
This phase started 60 years ago with the Apollo missions.

37
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:58,000
Since then, satellites like the American Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter have mapped the moon,

38
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:02,000
while rovers like the Chinese Yutu have studied the composition of the lunar surface,

39
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:05,000
looking for water ice and metals.

40
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:07,000
Phase one is more or less complete.

41
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:10,000
We know what we need to know to enter phase two.

42
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:16,000
In the second phase, astronauts will build the first moon base, and this could begin today.

43
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:20,000
The first small moon base could be completed in a decade.

44
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:27,000
The first nation that establishes this base will be akin to the first nation's building outposts in the New World 500 years ago.

45
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:33,000
It's expensive to send rockets to the moon, so we will send as little as possible.

46
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:38,000
The base will be light, little more than inflatable habitats for crews of no more than 12,

47
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:41,000
and will be deployed somewhere with a natural shelter.

48
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:49,000
Options include caves, like underground lava tube tunnels, or craters near the poles where the days are six months long.

49
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:52,000
These astronauts will not stay long.

50
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:55,000
The habitat is likely to be abandoned between missions,

51
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:59,000
as solar panels cannot generate electricity during the lunar night.

52
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:03,000
But they'll do the groundwork to enable humans to stay permanently.

53
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:08,000
Our first crew will consist of scientists and engineers who will study the composition of the moon

54
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:13,000
and whose experiments will explore ways of using the available lunar material,

55
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:17,000
say, purifying lunar ice and turning it into water for human use.

56
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:20,000
And water is important for far more than drinking.

57
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:24,000
They can use it to experiment with growing plants for food.

58
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:29,000
Hydrogen fuel cells will store power through the long night, extending astronaut stays.

59
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:35,000
And most importantly, it can be split into hydrogen and oxygen, rocket fuel.

60
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:40,000
By harvesting water from the moon and putting it into orbit,

61
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:47,000
the moon base will supply an orbital depot where scientific missions to Mars and the outer solar system can refuel.

62
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:54,000
Compared to the Earth, it's much easier and cheaper to get things off the moon into orbit.

63
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:58,000
Colonizing Mars may mean starting from the moon.

64
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:02,000
But this isn't a true colony. Not yet.

65
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:05,000
The base will be abandoned if funding stops.

66
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:09,000
If we want our base to grow into the third phase, into a true colony,

67
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:14,000
it must become self-sufficient, supporting itself via exports to Earth.

68
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:20,000
Now, private contractors arrive, looking to get rich off lunar resources and support services.

69
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:25,000
If it's cheaper to produce rocket fuel in space, what else can they get rich on?

70
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:32,000
They could extract precious metals, abundant in impact craters and other raw materials from the lunar regolith.

71
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:36,000
One promising possibility is the mining of helium-3,

72
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:40,000
an isotope that could one day be used in nuclear fusion reactors,

73
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:45,000
something the Chinese Lunar Exploration Program is currently looking into.

74
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:52,000
Future colonists may export helium-3 back to Earth, providing us with cheap and clean fusion energy.

75
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:56,000
Asteroids could be pulled into the moon's orbit and mined.

76
00:05:56,000 --> 00:06:04,000
With commercial exports to Earth, the colony is fully in its third phase, self-sufficient and economically productive.

77
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:09,000
Our base will begin using lunar material in its construction projects if it's to continue growing.

78
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:14,000
Fortunately, lunar soil has all the necessary ingredients to make concrete.

79
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:18,000
Robotic mining rigs can sift the lunar dust for organic molecules

80
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:23,000
and could be used to build huge structures way too massive to be brought from Earth,

81
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:30,000
while advances in 3D printing will make it possible to produce almost everything else the crews need.

82
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:35,000
It's hard to say when exactly the colony becomes self-sustaining.

83
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:39,000
Growth is gradual, experiments are replaced by industry,

84
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:44,000
and the population steadily reaches the hundreds, encompassing more than just scientists.

85
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:50,000
Engineers, pilots and contractors representing countries and corporations will be present.

86
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:56,000
Two of these people will make a breakthrough, not scientific, but social.

87
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:59,000
They will have the first extraterrestrial child.

88
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:08,000
Throughout history, the birth of the first child was celebrated as a moment where the seed of a colony finally and irreversibly took root.

89
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:12,000
Here, it means that the moon is not just a place for scientists and engineers to work,

90
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:16,000
it's a place for people to live, to raise a family.

91
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:20,000
Once this transition happens, the colony grows rapidly,

92
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:26,000
building more habitats and schools and farms and all the things needed to support the growing population.

93
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:32,000
As our colony grows, all kinds of new technologies will be invented to sustain it.

94
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:38,000
They might develop crops that efficiently recycle carbon dioxide or that grow with very little water.

95
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:46,000
They might find ways to recycle and reuse 100% of their waste, technologies that are extremely valuable for Earth.

96
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:50,000
They could even build the first space elevator in the solar system.

97
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:59,000
With a space elevator, spacecraft, astronauts and raw materials could be brought back and forth from lunar orbit without needing to use rockets at all.

98
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:05,000
The moon may become a hub for economic activity on a scale that's hard to imagine right now.

99
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:09,000
It's hard to say who will own the colony at this point.

100
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:13,000
Will the first person born on the moon take the national identity of their parents,

101
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:18,000
or will a new generation melt together into a new lunar society?

102
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:27,000
And when existing treaties that bar any nation from owning the moon are inevitably rewritten, will the colonists be given a say?

103
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:31,000
Will they declare independence from the Earth?

104
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:37,000
However it happens, the moon is a perfect sandbox to learn how to colonize the solar system,

105
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:45,000
the perfect project to unify nations, and the only way to guarantee our survival as a species should something tragic happen on Earth.

106
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:50,000
If we ever want to colonize the Milky Way, we'll have to start somewhere.

107
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:54,000
So why not start there? Why not start now?

108
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:08,000
While unfortunately you can't jump on a spacecraft and go to the moon right now, you can learn more interesting things about space and our universe.

109
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:10,000
And we can even help you with that.

110
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:17,000
Kurzgesagt and Brilliant are collaborating on a six-part video series about our favorite science and space topics.

111
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:21,000
Kurzgesagt has worked with Brilliant for a while now, and we love what they're doing.

112
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:25,000
In a nutshell, Brilliant teaches you science and maths with a hands-on approach.

113
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:31,000
By solving puzzles yourself, you learn to understand concepts instead of just memorizing facts.
