00:00.000 --> 00:08.000
We are prisoners on Earth. The universe taunts us by showing us all the places we can't ever visit.

00:08.000 --> 00:14.000
However, if our species wants to have a long-term future, we have to escape our prison.

00:14.000 --> 00:17.000
But what's keeping us here in the first place?

00:17.000 --> 00:24.000
Turns out we owe the universe a debt that is 4.5 billion years old.

00:30.000 --> 00:40.000
Everything with mass in the universe attracts every other thing with mass.

00:40.000 --> 00:43.000
We call this phenomenon gravity.

00:43.000 --> 00:49.000
The closer you are to a big chunk of mass, the stronger the attraction or the more you're pulled in.

00:49.000 --> 00:52.000
This effect traps us on Earth.

00:52.000 --> 00:57.000
We can imagine this as being prisoners in a gravity prison or a gravity well.

00:57.000 --> 01:02.000
It's not a literal well, but a handy concept to understand how this works.

01:02.000 --> 01:07.000
Being in a gravity prison means that you owe gravity energy.

01:07.000 --> 01:10.000
But how can you owe energy?

01:10.000 --> 01:14.000
Because in our universe, things don't want to change their speed or direction.

01:14.000 --> 01:18.000
To convince them to move, you have to expend energy.

01:18.000 --> 01:24.000
Billions of years ago, the gravitational attraction of trillions of trillions of dust particles orbiting our Sun

01:24.000 --> 01:27.000
pulled them together until they formed a planet.

01:27.000 --> 01:32.000
This process used energy and created the gravity well we're now a part of.

01:32.000 --> 01:37.000
The deeper you are inside a gravity well, the more energy you owe gravity.

01:37.000 --> 01:42.000
If you don't find a way to get enough energy, you're not able to leave, no matter what you do.

01:42.000 --> 01:49.000
Because your atoms were once part of the dust that the universe expended energy on to get to this place.

01:49.000 --> 01:53.000
Okay, hmm, let's summarize all of that again.

01:53.000 --> 01:59.000
Objects in the universe don't like to move. You have to convince them to do so with energy.

01:59.000 --> 02:04.000
Gravity used energy to convince the parts that make up our planet to move together.

02:04.000 --> 02:08.000
This created a gravity prison in the process, trapping us.

02:08.000 --> 02:11.000
To escape it, we need to repair it with energy.

02:11.000 --> 02:14.000
Okay, how do we do that?

02:14.000 --> 02:23.000
To get into space, we need to go through a complicated process of exchanging energy.

02:23.000 --> 02:31.000
For this purpose, we build a negative potential energy repaying machines, known by their more boring name, rockets.

02:31.000 --> 02:39.000
Rockets work by using some of the most energetic chemical reactions humans know about to basically explode fuel in a controlled way.

02:39.000 --> 02:43.000
This converts chemical energy into kinetic energy.

02:43.000 --> 02:49.000
The exhaust of the reaction is directed outwards and pushes the rocket away from Earth.

02:49.000 --> 02:54.000
By expending a lot of energy, we are increasing our gravitational potential energy,

02:54.000 --> 02:59.000
which is a complicated way to say that we're paying back our energy debt to gravity.

02:59.000 --> 03:02.000
But it's actually a lot trickier than that.

03:02.000 --> 03:11.000
When you burn fuel to get into orbit, you lose lots of energy to heat, the exhaust, and atmospheric drag, so you actually need much more.

03:11.000 --> 03:17.000
And you can't just pile a huge amount of really explosive dangerous fuel close to your payload and detonate it.

03:17.000 --> 03:24.000
You need a controlled burn, which is complicated and makes your rocket very heavy, which means it has more mass.

03:24.000 --> 03:29.000
The more mass something has, the more energy you need to convince it to move.

03:29.000 --> 03:32.000
So you need more fuel to lift up your rocket.

03:32.000 --> 03:37.000
But if you need more fuel, that means you need more rocket to carry that fuel.

03:37.000 --> 03:44.000
But this makes your rocket heavier, thus requiring more fuel, which requires more rocket to carry that new fuel, and so on.

03:44.000 --> 03:50.000
At the end of this madness, you need closer to a hundred times the weight of your payload to launch.

03:51.000 --> 04:03.000
Ariana 6, for example, the European rocket, will weigh 800 tons and should be able to transport 10 tons into geostationary transfer orbit, or 20 tons into medium Earth orbit.

04:03.000 --> 04:11.000
But a rocket can only produce so much thrust, so there's a maximum weight after which it just won't take off.

04:11.000 --> 04:17.000
If you add too much weight, it won't lift off, so you can't just build bigger and bigger fuel tanks.

04:17.000 --> 04:23.000
This is the tyranny of the rocket equation, and it means space flight will never become easy.

04:23.000 --> 04:25.000
But wait, it gets worse.

04:25.000 --> 04:28.000
Getting to space is still not good enough.

04:28.000 --> 04:33.000
You're still inside the gravity prison at the edge of space and will crash back to Earth.

04:33.000 --> 04:36.000
Staying in space is much harder than getting there.

04:36.000 --> 04:42.000
To get to a stable position where it can stay for a while, a rocket has to reach low Earth orbit.

04:42.000 --> 04:47.000
To do this, you need a lot of kinetic energy, which means going extremely fast.

04:47.000 --> 04:55.000
At an altitude of about 100 kilometers, this is 8 kilometers per second, 28,000 kilometers per hour.

04:55.000 --> 04:58.000
Fast enough to travel around Earth in 90 minutes.

04:58.000 --> 05:00.000
Here, we can use a trick.

05:00.000 --> 05:04.000
Instead of flying straight up, we can go sideways.

05:05.000 --> 05:07.000
Earth is a sphere.

05:07.000 --> 05:13.000
So if you're going sideways fast enough, even though you're falling towards Earth, the ground will curve away beneath you.

05:13.000 --> 05:20.000
So as long as you're above the atmosphere, about 100 kilometers up, you'll be able to stay up there in orbit.

05:20.000 --> 05:27.000
This is what the ISS does, falling around Earth, expending energy from time to time to stay fast enough.

05:27.000 --> 05:33.000
If we look at orbits in scale, we see that near-Earth orbit is laughably close to Earth.

05:33.000 --> 05:40.000
To deploy, for example, satellites or leave for other planets requires another round of energy debt repayment.

05:40.000 --> 05:45.000
Getting to orbit is the most difficult part of spaceflight for us right now.

05:45.000 --> 05:51.000
For example, if we want to send a rocket to Mars, half the energy is necessary just to get into orbit,

05:51.000 --> 05:55.000
and the other half for the 55 million kilometers to Mars.

05:55.000 --> 06:00.000
Therefore, to be as effective as possible, rockets aren't built in one giant piece.

06:00.000 --> 06:02.000
Instead, we use multistage rockets.

06:02.000 --> 06:06.000
You don't need to carry an empty fuel tank, so rockets drop it.

06:06.000 --> 06:10.000
Rockets today shed their boosters and main stage as they ascend,

06:10.000 --> 06:16.000
with each successive stage being its own fully contained rocket, complete with its own engine and fuel.

06:16.000 --> 06:20.000
Okay, so this is why getting to space is hard.

06:20.000 --> 06:24.000
If you feel all of this seems really complicated, don't worry.

06:24.000 --> 06:27.000
It's literally rocket science.

06:28.000 --> 06:35.000
This video was made possible in part by a sponsorship by Airbus, Safran Launchers and Ariana Space,

06:35.000 --> 06:39.000
who are getting their new Ariana 6 rocket ready to launch into space in 2020.

06:39.000 --> 06:42.000
