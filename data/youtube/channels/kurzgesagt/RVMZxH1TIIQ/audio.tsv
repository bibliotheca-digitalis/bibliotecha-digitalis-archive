0	8000	We are prisoners on Earth. The universe taunts us by showing us all the places we can't ever visit.
8000	14000	However, if our species wants to have a long-term future, we have to escape our prison.
14000	17000	But what's keeping us here in the first place?
17000	24000	Turns out we owe the universe a debt that is 4.5 billion years old.
30000	40000	Everything with mass in the universe attracts every other thing with mass.
40000	43000	We call this phenomenon gravity.
43000	49000	The closer you are to a big chunk of mass, the stronger the attraction or the more you're pulled in.
49000	52000	This effect traps us on Earth.
52000	57000	We can imagine this as being prisoners in a gravity prison or a gravity well.
57000	62000	It's not a literal well, but a handy concept to understand how this works.
62000	67000	Being in a gravity prison means that you owe gravity energy.
67000	70000	But how can you owe energy?
70000	74000	Because in our universe, things don't want to change their speed or direction.
74000	78000	To convince them to move, you have to expend energy.
78000	84000	Billions of years ago, the gravitational attraction of trillions of trillions of dust particles orbiting our Sun
84000	87000	pulled them together until they formed a planet.
87000	92000	This process used energy and created the gravity well we're now a part of.
92000	97000	The deeper you are inside a gravity well, the more energy you owe gravity.
97000	102000	If you don't find a way to get enough energy, you're not able to leave, no matter what you do.
102000	109000	Because your atoms were once part of the dust that the universe expended energy on to get to this place.
109000	113000	Okay, hmm, let's summarize all of that again.
113000	119000	Objects in the universe don't like to move. You have to convince them to do so with energy.
119000	124000	Gravity used energy to convince the parts that make up our planet to move together.
124000	128000	This created a gravity prison in the process, trapping us.
128000	131000	To escape it, we need to repair it with energy.
131000	134000	Okay, how do we do that?
134000	143000	To get into space, we need to go through a complicated process of exchanging energy.
143000	151000	For this purpose, we build a negative potential energy repaying machines, known by their more boring name, rockets.
151000	159000	Rockets work by using some of the most energetic chemical reactions humans know about to basically explode fuel in a controlled way.
159000	163000	This converts chemical energy into kinetic energy.
163000	169000	The exhaust of the reaction is directed outwards and pushes the rocket away from Earth.
169000	174000	By expending a lot of energy, we are increasing our gravitational potential energy,
174000	179000	which is a complicated way to say that we're paying back our energy debt to gravity.
179000	182000	But it's actually a lot trickier than that.
182000	191000	When you burn fuel to get into orbit, you lose lots of energy to heat, the exhaust, and atmospheric drag, so you actually need much more.
191000	197000	And you can't just pile a huge amount of really explosive dangerous fuel close to your payload and detonate it.
197000	204000	You need a controlled burn, which is complicated and makes your rocket very heavy, which means it has more mass.
204000	209000	The more mass something has, the more energy you need to convince it to move.
209000	212000	So you need more fuel to lift up your rocket.
212000	217000	But if you need more fuel, that means you need more rocket to carry that fuel.
217000	224000	But this makes your rocket heavier, thus requiring more fuel, which requires more rocket to carry that new fuel, and so on.
224000	230000	At the end of this madness, you need closer to a hundred times the weight of your payload to launch.
231000	243000	Ariana 6, for example, the European rocket, will weigh 800 tons and should be able to transport 10 tons into geostationary transfer orbit, or 20 tons into medium Earth orbit.
243000	251000	But a rocket can only produce so much thrust, so there's a maximum weight after which it just won't take off.
251000	257000	If you add too much weight, it won't lift off, so you can't just build bigger and bigger fuel tanks.
257000	263000	This is the tyranny of the rocket equation, and it means space flight will never become easy.
263000	265000	But wait, it gets worse.
265000	268000	Getting to space is still not good enough.
268000	273000	You're still inside the gravity prison at the edge of space and will crash back to Earth.
273000	276000	Staying in space is much harder than getting there.
276000	282000	To get to a stable position where it can stay for a while, a rocket has to reach low Earth orbit.
282000	287000	To do this, you need a lot of kinetic energy, which means going extremely fast.
287000	295000	At an altitude of about 100 kilometers, this is 8 kilometers per second, 28,000 kilometers per hour.
295000	298000	Fast enough to travel around Earth in 90 minutes.
298000	300000	Here, we can use a trick.
300000	304000	Instead of flying straight up, we can go sideways.
305000	307000	Earth is a sphere.
307000	313000	So if you're going sideways fast enough, even though you're falling towards Earth, the ground will curve away beneath you.
313000	320000	So as long as you're above the atmosphere, about 100 kilometers up, you'll be able to stay up there in orbit.
320000	327000	This is what the ISS does, falling around Earth, expending energy from time to time to stay fast enough.
327000	333000	If we look at orbits in scale, we see that near-Earth orbit is laughably close to Earth.
333000	340000	To deploy, for example, satellites or leave for other planets requires another round of energy debt repayment.
340000	345000	Getting to orbit is the most difficult part of spaceflight for us right now.
345000	351000	For example, if we want to send a rocket to Mars, half the energy is necessary just to get into orbit,
351000	355000	and the other half for the 55 million kilometers to Mars.
355000	360000	Therefore, to be as effective as possible, rockets aren't built in one giant piece.
360000	362000	Instead, we use multistage rockets.
362000	366000	You don't need to carry an empty fuel tank, so rockets drop it.
366000	370000	Rockets today shed their boosters and main stage as they ascend,
370000	376000	with each successive stage being its own fully contained rocket, complete with its own engine and fuel.
376000	380000	Okay, so this is why getting to space is hard.
380000	384000	If you feel all of this seems really complicated, don't worry.
384000	387000	It's literally rocket science.
388000	395000	This video was made possible in part by a sponsorship by Airbus, Safran Launchers and Ariana Space,
395000	399000	who are getting their new Ariana 6 rocket ready to launch into space in 2020.
