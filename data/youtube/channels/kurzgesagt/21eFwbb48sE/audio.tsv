0	5440	So, have you ever wondered who actually invented the internet?
5440	9880	Some people have become zillionaires thanks to the internet, but all they did was invent
9880	12340	clever ways of using the internet.
12340	17760	So the person who invented the internet should be a gazillionaire equivalent to say God,
17760	18760	shouldn't they?
18760	21040	Who should get the credit then?
21040	23640	Was it a British geek in a Swiss underground lab?
23640	24640	Maybe.
24640	28360	Clever Americans threatened with nuclear annihilation by the Russians?
28360	29680	Nice idea.
29720	35120	Or was it French scientists who decided to call their computer network the l'internet?
35120	36120	Interesting.
36120	41080	Or was it thanks to a myriad of smart scientists working on something they knew was useful
41080	44440	but didn't realize would be so big?
51440	54040	Well, let's try and get some facts straight.
54040	58400	There's the internet, a whole bunch of computer networks connected to each other, and then
58440	64060	there's the World Wide Web, a way of making it easier to share information using all those
64060	66260	interconnected computers.
66260	70980	The internet as we know it today was at least 40 years in the making.
70980	76640	One popular but wrong story is that the internet was developed by the USA, so they had a communication
76640	80000	network that would survive a nuclear war.
80000	84680	According to one of the founders of the first network, the ARPANET, in the 1960s, this first
84680	89880	network experiment wasn't about communication at all, it was about optimizing processor
89880	94840	usage or timesharing, which basically meant that scientists could share computer power
94840	95920	too.
95920	100600	That was because until the 1960s, there was basically no network, you had big machines
100600	106380	called mainframes, which sat in a room and processed computing tasks one at a time.
106380	110840	With timesharing, these behemoths could process several tasks at a time, which meant their
110840	114640	power could be used by several scientists at once.
114640	119360	And obviously, once you start connecting computers together, you start to wonder about
119360	124240	what you need to do to make communications between them easier.
124240	127220	Scientists around the world were trying to solve this problem.
127220	131960	So let's look at some of the other key concepts that were developed elsewhere.
131960	133680	Starting with packet switching.
133680	138000	In Britain, there was a commercial network developed by the National Physical Laboratory,
138000	141920	but which never really got off the ground because it didn't get funding.
142040	147040	They did come up with the idea of packet switching, a way of avoiding congestion in busy networks
147040	151600	by cutting up data at one end and putting it back together at the other.
151600	153680	The French also played a role.
153680	158080	They were working on a scientific network called Cyclades, but they didn't have a big
158080	163460	budget, so they decided to work on direct connections between computers as opposed to
163460	165560	working with gateway computers.
165560	171440	Now, as an aside here, this admittedly isn't very scientific, but according to one theory,
171440	175640	a spin-off of their research was the word Antacnet.
175640	178560	But you don't have to believe it if you don't want to.
178560	181000	So now it's the early 1970s.
181000	185440	There's quite a lot of computer infrastructure, but communication is awkward and patchy because
185440	188480	different networks can't talk to each other.
188480	191400	TCP IP solves this problem.
191400	196480	The TCP IP protocols form the basic communication language of the internet, which labels the
196480	201240	packets of data and makes sure that even though some pieces of the same data take a different
201240	206260	route, they all arrive at their destination and can be reassembled.
206260	210160	Networks really began communicating with each other in 1975.
210160	213680	So you could argue that was the beginning of the internet.
213680	215380	Email was also very important.
215380	218720	It was developed for ARPANET in 1972.
218720	224320	Most internet traffic in 1976 was email, because academics thought electronic post-it notes
224320	226220	were dead cool.
226220	230780	With networks that could talk to each other, communication was becoming easier.
230820	236500	But all this communication was just text-based, and it was pretty ugly to look at.
236500	241700	In the 1980s, a brick called Timothy Berners-Lee spent time with CERN, the European Organization
241700	246900	for Nuclear Research, where physicists are trying to work out what the universe is made
246900	247900	of.
247900	252100	He wanted to manage the scientists' information and make it possible for them to share and
252100	256580	interconnect their work easily, making progress more likely.
256580	263180	He did so by inventing an interface using HTTP, HTML, and URLs that made internet browsers
263180	264300	possible.
264300	267260	He called his browser the World Wide Web.
267260	272240	So he didn't invent the internet, but he did invent the web.
272240	278060	The first ever website which he created was at CERN in France in August 1991.
278060	283060	So once the initial infrastructure was in place, the key technologies had been invented,
283060	287420	internet message boards exploded in the 1980s, the phone companies saw the commercial potential
287420	292720	of digital communication, web browsers spread like wildfire in the early 1990s, and ordinary
292720	294420	people discovered email.
294420	299940	Then, the internet expanded rapidly and steadily and became workable for the masses from about
299940	300940	1995.
300940	306260	Hold on, didn't US Vice President Al Gore invent the internet?
306260	307520	Ah, no.
307520	312200	And if you read what he said exactly, you'd know he never claimed to have done.
312200	317020	But many people credit him with energetically pushing legislation that encouraged the spread
317020	318900	of the internet.
318900	325040	The internet exists because we need to communicate, and most of us like doing it.
325040	329020	That's why humans have become the dominant species on Earth.
329020	334880	You could argue that the internet is a natural evolutionary step and a manifestation of that
334880	336320	need.
336320	340680	It wasn't invented by anyone in particular, but when the building blocks were put together
340680	345660	by all those cool scientists from all over the place, the internet became a communication
345660	352460	tool, a retail tool, a research tool, a propaganda tool, a spying tool, a shopping tool, a dating
352460	356820	tool, an entertainment tool, and a way of skiving off work while making it look like
356820	360460	you're working or studying, which is what you may be doing now.
360460	365300	Ultimately though, you're communicating, especially if you leave a comment, and that
365300	367180	might make you a better human being.
370680	371680	Thanks for watching.
