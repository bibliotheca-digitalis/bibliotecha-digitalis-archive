00:00.000 --> 00:05.440
So, have you ever wondered who actually invented the internet?

00:05.440 --> 00:09.880
Some people have become zillionaires thanks to the internet, but all they did was invent

00:09.880 --> 00:12.340
clever ways of using the internet.

00:12.340 --> 00:17.760
So the person who invented the internet should be a gazillionaire equivalent to say God,

00:17.760 --> 00:18.760
shouldn't they?

00:18.760 --> 00:21.040
Who should get the credit then?

00:21.040 --> 00:23.640
Was it a British geek in a Swiss underground lab?

00:23.640 --> 00:24.640
Maybe.

00:24.640 --> 00:28.360
Clever Americans threatened with nuclear annihilation by the Russians?

00:28.360 --> 00:29.680
Nice idea.

00:29.720 --> 00:35.120
Or was it French scientists who decided to call their computer network the l'internet?

00:35.120 --> 00:36.120
Interesting.

00:36.120 --> 00:41.080
Or was it thanks to a myriad of smart scientists working on something they knew was useful

00:41.080 --> 00:44.440
but didn't realize would be so big?

00:51.440 --> 00:54.040
Well, let's try and get some facts straight.

00:54.040 --> 00:58.400
There's the internet, a whole bunch of computer networks connected to each other, and then

00:58.440 --> 01:04.060
there's the World Wide Web, a way of making it easier to share information using all those

01:04.060 --> 01:06.260
interconnected computers.

01:06.260 --> 01:10.980
The internet as we know it today was at least 40 years in the making.

01:10.980 --> 01:16.640
One popular but wrong story is that the internet was developed by the USA, so they had a communication

01:16.640 --> 01:20.000
network that would survive a nuclear war.

01:20.000 --> 01:24.680
According to one of the founders of the first network, the ARPANET, in the 1960s, this first

01:24.680 --> 01:29.880
network experiment wasn't about communication at all, it was about optimizing processor

01:29.880 --> 01:34.840
usage or timesharing, which basically meant that scientists could share computer power

01:34.840 --> 01:35.920
too.

01:35.920 --> 01:40.600
That was because until the 1960s, there was basically no network, you had big machines

01:40.600 --> 01:46.380
called mainframes, which sat in a room and processed computing tasks one at a time.

01:46.380 --> 01:50.840
With timesharing, these behemoths could process several tasks at a time, which meant their

01:50.840 --> 01:54.640
power could be used by several scientists at once.

01:54.640 --> 01:59.360
And obviously, once you start connecting computers together, you start to wonder about

01:59.360 --> 02:04.240
what you need to do to make communications between them easier.

02:04.240 --> 02:07.220
Scientists around the world were trying to solve this problem.

02:07.220 --> 02:11.960
So let's look at some of the other key concepts that were developed elsewhere.

02:11.960 --> 02:13.680
Starting with packet switching.

02:13.680 --> 02:18.000
In Britain, there was a commercial network developed by the National Physical Laboratory,

02:18.000 --> 02:21.920
but which never really got off the ground because it didn't get funding.

02:22.040 --> 02:27.040
They did come up with the idea of packet switching, a way of avoiding congestion in busy networks

02:27.040 --> 02:31.600
by cutting up data at one end and putting it back together at the other.

02:31.600 --> 02:33.680
The French also played a role.

02:33.680 --> 02:38.080
They were working on a scientific network called Cyclades, but they didn't have a big

02:38.080 --> 02:43.460
budget, so they decided to work on direct connections between computers as opposed to

02:43.460 --> 02:45.560
working with gateway computers.

02:45.560 --> 02:51.440
Now, as an aside here, this admittedly isn't very scientific, but according to one theory,

02:51.440 --> 02:55.640
a spin-off of their research was the word Antacnet.

02:55.640 --> 02:58.560
But you don't have to believe it if you don't want to.

02:58.560 --> 03:01.000
So now it's the early 1970s.

03:01.000 --> 03:05.440
There's quite a lot of computer infrastructure, but communication is awkward and patchy because

03:05.440 --> 03:08.480
different networks can't talk to each other.

03:08.480 --> 03:11.400
TCP IP solves this problem.

03:11.400 --> 03:16.480
The TCP IP protocols form the basic communication language of the internet, which labels the

03:16.480 --> 03:21.240
packets of data and makes sure that even though some pieces of the same data take a different

03:21.240 --> 03:26.260
route, they all arrive at their destination and can be reassembled.

03:26.260 --> 03:30.160
Networks really began communicating with each other in 1975.

03:30.160 --> 03:33.680
So you could argue that was the beginning of the internet.

03:33.680 --> 03:35.380
Email was also very important.

03:35.380 --> 03:38.720
It was developed for ARPANET in 1972.

03:38.720 --> 03:44.320
Most internet traffic in 1976 was email, because academics thought electronic post-it notes

03:44.320 --> 03:46.220
were dead cool.

03:46.220 --> 03:50.780
With networks that could talk to each other, communication was becoming easier.

03:50.820 --> 03:56.500
But all this communication was just text-based, and it was pretty ugly to look at.

03:56.500 --> 04:01.700
In the 1980s, a brick called Timothy Berners-Lee spent time with CERN, the European Organization

04:01.700 --> 04:06.900
for Nuclear Research, where physicists are trying to work out what the universe is made

04:06.900 --> 04:07.900
of.

04:07.900 --> 04:12.100
He wanted to manage the scientists' information and make it possible for them to share and

04:12.100 --> 04:16.580
interconnect their work easily, making progress more likely.

04:16.580 --> 04:23.180
He did so by inventing an interface using HTTP, HTML, and URLs that made internet browsers

04:23.180 --> 04:24.300
possible.

04:24.300 --> 04:27.260
He called his browser the World Wide Web.

04:27.260 --> 04:32.240
So he didn't invent the internet, but he did invent the web.

04:32.240 --> 04:38.060
The first ever website which he created was at CERN in France in August 1991.

04:38.060 --> 04:43.060
So once the initial infrastructure was in place, the key technologies had been invented,

04:43.060 --> 04:47.420
internet message boards exploded in the 1980s, the phone companies saw the commercial potential

04:47.420 --> 04:52.720
of digital communication, web browsers spread like wildfire in the early 1990s, and ordinary

04:52.720 --> 04:54.420
people discovered email.

04:54.420 --> 04:59.940
Then, the internet expanded rapidly and steadily and became workable for the masses from about

04:59.940 --> 05:00.940
1995.

05:00.940 --> 05:06.260
Hold on, didn't US Vice President Al Gore invent the internet?

05:06.260 --> 05:07.520
Ah, no.

05:07.520 --> 05:12.200
And if you read what he said exactly, you'd know he never claimed to have done.

05:12.200 --> 05:17.020
But many people credit him with energetically pushing legislation that encouraged the spread

05:17.020 --> 05:18.900
of the internet.

05:18.900 --> 05:25.040
The internet exists because we need to communicate, and most of us like doing it.

05:25.040 --> 05:29.020
That's why humans have become the dominant species on Earth.

05:29.020 --> 05:34.880
You could argue that the internet is a natural evolutionary step and a manifestation of that

05:34.880 --> 05:36.320
need.

05:36.320 --> 05:40.680
It wasn't invented by anyone in particular, but when the building blocks were put together

05:40.680 --> 05:45.660
by all those cool scientists from all over the place, the internet became a communication

05:45.660 --> 05:52.460
tool, a retail tool, a research tool, a propaganda tool, a spying tool, a shopping tool, a dating

05:52.460 --> 05:56.820
tool, an entertainment tool, and a way of skiving off work while making it look like

05:56.820 --> 06:00.460
you're working or studying, which is what you may be doing now.

06:00.460 --> 06:05.300
Ultimately though, you're communicating, especially if you leave a comment, and that

06:05.300 --> 06:07.180
might make you a better human being.

06:10.680 --> 06:11.680
Thanks for watching.

06:11.680 --> 06:11.680
