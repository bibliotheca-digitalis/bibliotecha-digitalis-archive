1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,440
So, have you ever wondered who actually invented the internet?

2
00:00:05,440 --> 00:00:09,880
Some people have become zillionaires thanks to the internet, but all they did was invent

3
00:00:09,880 --> 00:00:12,340
clever ways of using the internet.

4
00:00:12,340 --> 00:00:17,760
So the person who invented the internet should be a gazillionaire equivalent to say God,

5
00:00:17,760 --> 00:00:18,760
shouldn't they?

6
00:00:18,760 --> 00:00:21,040
Who should get the credit then?

7
00:00:21,040 --> 00:00:23,640
Was it a British geek in a Swiss underground lab?

8
00:00:23,640 --> 00:00:24,640
Maybe.

9
00:00:24,640 --> 00:00:28,360
Clever Americans threatened with nuclear annihilation by the Russians?

10
00:00:28,360 --> 00:00:29,680
Nice idea.

11
00:00:29,720 --> 00:00:35,120
Or was it French scientists who decided to call their computer network the l'internet?

12
00:00:35,120 --> 00:00:36,120
Interesting.

13
00:00:36,120 --> 00:00:41,080
Or was it thanks to a myriad of smart scientists working on something they knew was useful

14
00:00:41,080 --> 00:00:44,440
but didn't realize would be so big?

15
00:00:51,440 --> 00:00:54,040
Well, let's try and get some facts straight.

16
00:00:54,040 --> 00:00:58,400
There's the internet, a whole bunch of computer networks connected to each other, and then

17
00:00:58,440 --> 00:01:04,060
there's the World Wide Web, a way of making it easier to share information using all those

18
00:01:04,060 --> 00:01:06,260
interconnected computers.

19
00:01:06,260 --> 00:01:10,980
The internet as we know it today was at least 40 years in the making.

20
00:01:10,980 --> 00:01:16,640
One popular but wrong story is that the internet was developed by the USA, so they had a communication

21
00:01:16,640 --> 00:01:20,000
network that would survive a nuclear war.

22
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:24,680
According to one of the founders of the first network, the ARPANET, in the 1960s, this first

23
00:01:24,680 --> 00:01:29,880
network experiment wasn't about communication at all, it was about optimizing processor

24
00:01:29,880 --> 00:01:34,840
usage or timesharing, which basically meant that scientists could share computer power

25
00:01:34,840 --> 00:01:35,920
too.

26
00:01:35,920 --> 00:01:40,600
That was because until the 1960s, there was basically no network, you had big machines

27
00:01:40,600 --> 00:01:46,380
called mainframes, which sat in a room and processed computing tasks one at a time.

28
00:01:46,380 --> 00:01:50,840
With timesharing, these behemoths could process several tasks at a time, which meant their

29
00:01:50,840 --> 00:01:54,640
power could be used by several scientists at once.

30
00:01:54,640 --> 00:01:59,360
And obviously, once you start connecting computers together, you start to wonder about

31
00:01:59,360 --> 00:02:04,240
what you need to do to make communications between them easier.

32
00:02:04,240 --> 00:02:07,220
Scientists around the world were trying to solve this problem.

33
00:02:07,220 --> 00:02:11,960
So let's look at some of the other key concepts that were developed elsewhere.

34
00:02:11,960 --> 00:02:13,680
Starting with packet switching.

35
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:18,000
In Britain, there was a commercial network developed by the National Physical Laboratory,

36
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:21,920
but which never really got off the ground because it didn't get funding.

37
00:02:22,040 --> 00:02:27,040
They did come up with the idea of packet switching, a way of avoiding congestion in busy networks

38
00:02:27,040 --> 00:02:31,600
by cutting up data at one end and putting it back together at the other.

39
00:02:31,600 --> 00:02:33,680
The French also played a role.

40
00:02:33,680 --> 00:02:38,080
They were working on a scientific network called Cyclades, but they didn't have a big

41
00:02:38,080 --> 00:02:43,460
budget, so they decided to work on direct connections between computers as opposed to

42
00:02:43,460 --> 00:02:45,560
working with gateway computers.

43
00:02:45,560 --> 00:02:51,440
Now, as an aside here, this admittedly isn't very scientific, but according to one theory,

44
00:02:51,440 --> 00:02:55,640
a spin-off of their research was the word Antacnet.

45
00:02:55,640 --> 00:02:58,560
But you don't have to believe it if you don't want to.

46
00:02:58,560 --> 00:03:01,000
So now it's the early 1970s.

47
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:05,440
There's quite a lot of computer infrastructure, but communication is awkward and patchy because

48
00:03:05,440 --> 00:03:08,480
different networks can't talk to each other.

49
00:03:08,480 --> 00:03:11,400
TCP IP solves this problem.

50
00:03:11,400 --> 00:03:16,480
The TCP IP protocols form the basic communication language of the internet, which labels the

51
00:03:16,480 --> 00:03:21,240
packets of data and makes sure that even though some pieces of the same data take a different

52
00:03:21,240 --> 00:03:26,260
route, they all arrive at their destination and can be reassembled.

53
00:03:26,260 --> 00:03:30,160
Networks really began communicating with each other in 1975.

54
00:03:30,160 --> 00:03:33,680
So you could argue that was the beginning of the internet.

55
00:03:33,680 --> 00:03:35,380
Email was also very important.

56
00:03:35,380 --> 00:03:38,720
It was developed for ARPANET in 1972.

57
00:03:38,720 --> 00:03:44,320
Most internet traffic in 1976 was email, because academics thought electronic post-it notes

58
00:03:44,320 --> 00:03:46,220
were dead cool.

59
00:03:46,220 --> 00:03:50,780
With networks that could talk to each other, communication was becoming easier.

60
00:03:50,820 --> 00:03:56,500
But all this communication was just text-based, and it was pretty ugly to look at.

61
00:03:56,500 --> 00:04:01,700
In the 1980s, a brick called Timothy Berners-Lee spent time with CERN, the European Organization

62
00:04:01,700 --> 00:04:06,900
for Nuclear Research, where physicists are trying to work out what the universe is made

63
00:04:06,900 --> 00:04:07,900
of.

64
00:04:07,900 --> 00:04:12,100
He wanted to manage the scientists' information and make it possible for them to share and

65
00:04:12,100 --> 00:04:16,580
interconnect their work easily, making progress more likely.

66
00:04:16,580 --> 00:04:23,180
He did so by inventing an interface using HTTP, HTML, and URLs that made internet browsers

67
00:04:23,180 --> 00:04:24,300
possible.

68
00:04:24,300 --> 00:04:27,260
He called his browser the World Wide Web.

69
00:04:27,260 --> 00:04:32,240
So he didn't invent the internet, but he did invent the web.

70
00:04:32,240 --> 00:04:38,060
The first ever website which he created was at CERN in France in August 1991.

71
00:04:38,060 --> 00:04:43,060
So once the initial infrastructure was in place, the key technologies had been invented,

72
00:04:43,060 --> 00:04:47,420
internet message boards exploded in the 1980s, the phone companies saw the commercial potential

73
00:04:47,420 --> 00:04:52,720
of digital communication, web browsers spread like wildfire in the early 1990s, and ordinary

74
00:04:52,720 --> 00:04:54,420
people discovered email.

75
00:04:54,420 --> 00:04:59,940
Then, the internet expanded rapidly and steadily and became workable for the masses from about

76
00:04:59,940 --> 00:05:00,940
1995.

77
00:05:00,940 --> 00:05:06,260
Hold on, didn't US Vice President Al Gore invent the internet?

78
00:05:06,260 --> 00:05:07,520
Ah, no.

79
00:05:07,520 --> 00:05:12,200
And if you read what he said exactly, you'd know he never claimed to have done.

80
00:05:12,200 --> 00:05:17,020
But many people credit him with energetically pushing legislation that encouraged the spread

81
00:05:17,020 --> 00:05:18,900
of the internet.

82
00:05:18,900 --> 00:05:25,040
The internet exists because we need to communicate, and most of us like doing it.

83
00:05:25,040 --> 00:05:29,020
That's why humans have become the dominant species on Earth.

84
00:05:29,020 --> 00:05:34,880
You could argue that the internet is a natural evolutionary step and a manifestation of that

85
00:05:34,880 --> 00:05:36,320
need.

86
00:05:36,320 --> 00:05:40,680
It wasn't invented by anyone in particular, but when the building blocks were put together

87
00:05:40,680 --> 00:05:45,660
by all those cool scientists from all over the place, the internet became a communication

88
00:05:45,660 --> 00:05:52,460
tool, a retail tool, a research tool, a propaganda tool, a spying tool, a shopping tool, a dating

89
00:05:52,460 --> 00:05:56,820
tool, an entertainment tool, and a way of skiving off work while making it look like

90
00:05:56,820 --> 00:06:00,460
you're working or studying, which is what you may be doing now.

91
00:06:00,460 --> 00:06:05,300
Ultimately though, you're communicating, especially if you leave a comment, and that

92
00:06:05,300 --> 00:06:07,180
might make you a better human being.

93
00:06:10,680 --> 00:06:11,680
Thanks for watching.

94
00:06:11,680 --> 00:06:11,680
