0	4000	Human history is told by the energy we use.
4000	9000	At first we had to use our muscles, then we learned to control fire.
9000	12000	We industrialized the world using coal and oil,
12000	16000	and entered the atomic age when we learned how to split a nucleus.
16000	21000	At each step we increased our energy harvest to a scale never seen before,
21000	23000	and advanced as a species.
23000	26000	Currently we're slowly transitioning to renewables,
26000	31000	and if we're lucky, fusion energy will become viable in the future.
31000	36000	As humanity progresses further, if we don't destroy ourselves or our habitat,
36000	40000	we will likely gain complete control of our planet's resources.
40000	46000	At that stage, we'll probably begin to look outwards for new places to expand into.
46000	51000	But space is hard, and establishing a serious human presence in the solar system
51000	54000	will require ungodly amounts of energy.
54000	57000	Luckily, we know where to find it.
57000	60000	The sun, the ultimate source of energy.
60000	66000	A furnace 100 quintillion times more powerful than our most efficient nuclear reactor.
66000	71000	It shines with the energy of a trillion nuclear bombs per second.
71000	73000	So how do we get this energy?
73000	76000	Not some of it, all of it.
85000	88000	If we want to collect the most energy physically possible,
88000	92000	we'll have to build the largest, most ambitious structure in the universe.
92000	93000	The Dyson Sphere.
93000	98000	A megastructure that encompasses a whole star to capture its power output.
98000	103000	For an intelligent species, building a Dyson Sphere is a technological leap
103000	106000	on a par with the discovery of fire for our ancestors.
106000	111000	The transition from a planetary species to an interstellar species.
111000	117000	It would usher in an age of exploration and expansion on a scale we can barely imagine.
117000	119000	So, what would it look like?
119000	123000	A solid shell enveloping the sun is probably not the way to go.
123000	128000	A large rigid body like that would be vulnerable to impacts, possibly shattering.
128000	132000	It would be liable to drift and could crash straight into the sun.
132000	136000	A more viable design for a Dyson Sphere might be a Dyson Swarm,
136000	141000	an enormous set of orbiting panels that collect the sun's power and beam it elsewhere.
141000	145000	Such a swarm would give humanity basically unlimited energy.
145000	148000	But building it won't be easy.
148000	152000	The sun is very big, so we need a lot of satellites.
152000	158000	If each satellite is a square kilometer, we'd need around 30 quadrillion to surround the sun.
158000	164000	Even if they're built as lightly as possible, we need about 100 quintillion tons of material.
164000	171000	And then we need the energy to actually put the parts together and deliver them to their positions around the sun.
171000	177000	On top of all that, we need to have a permanent infrastructure set up in space to start building.
177000	184000	Let's assume for the purposes of this video that our descendants will take care of that and want to create the megastructure.
184000	187000	We can sort the challenges into three main categories.
187000	190000	Materials, design and energy.
191000	198000	To get the vast amounts of raw materials required for our Dyson Swarm, we'll have to largely disassemble a whole planet.
198000	202000	Of the planets available, Mercury is the best candidate.
202000	205000	It's the closest to the sun and very metal-rich.
205000	209000	Close to the sun also means less moving stuff around,
209000	214000	and Mercury has no atmosphere and only about a third of the surface gravity of Earth,
214000	218000	making it comparatively easy to launch material into space.
218000	221000	Next, we should consider the design of our swarm.
221000	223000	Simpler is better.
223000	227000	Conventional solar panels are far too intricate and short-lived.
227000	232000	Our satellites need to operate without repairs or intervention for astronomically long times,
232000	235000	and they need to be cheap to produce.
235000	238000	They're most likely going to be enormous mirrors,
238000	244000	which refocus sunlight to central collecting stations, like in concentrated solar power on Earth.
244000	248000	To build and launch them efficiently, they must be incredibly light,
248000	252000	made of little more than polished metal foil bound to some supports.
252000	256000	And last, we need the energy to build and launch the swarm itself.
256000	261000	Taking apart a planet and launching things into space requires an enormous amount of energy.
261000	267000	For example, if we used all the fossil fuels and uranium on Earth and we were perfectly efficient,
267000	271000	we could only launch as much mass as Mount Everest into space.
271000	275000	A rather meager accomplishment compared to planetary disassembly.
275000	278000	To get the energy needed to build a Dyson sphere,
278000	282000	it's almost as if you're going to need the power output of a Dyson sphere.
282000	288000	But that's okay. There's plenty of sunlight to be had on Mercury, so let's get to work.
288000	292000	Humans are expensive to keep alive and are very sensitive to the environment,
292000	295000	so we'd want to automate as much as possible.
295000	300000	Ideally, we'd have a small crew of controllers who oversee an army of autonomous machines
300000	302000	doing the actual work.
302000	306000	There are four major pieces of technology required.
306000	311000	Solar collectors, miners, refiners, and launch equipment.
311000	316000	The solar collectors are going to give us the energy we need to disassemble the planet.
316000	320000	To start, maybe we deploy something like one square kilometer of them,
320000	323000	either as mirrors or as traditional solar panels.
323000	327000	They'll provide the energy to run our miners, which strip mine the surface of the planet,
327000	333000	and our refiners, which extract valuable elements and fabricate them into our swarm satellites.
333000	337000	To get them into space, we need a creative and efficient solution.
337000	342000	Rockets are too expensive and difficult to deorbit and reuse.
342000	345000	Instead, we'll want to use a sort of railgun,
345000	350000	a long electromagnetic track which launches our satellites at high speeds.
350000	353000	Our swarm satellites would be packed tight for launch,
353000	356000	unfurling like an enormous origami once in orbit.
356000	360000	From this point, we can take advantage of exponential growth,
360000	365000	using the energy of the existing parts of the swarm to build more infrastructure on Mercury
365000	368000	and launch new panels faster and faster.
368000	371000	Each panel provides the energy to build another.
371000	373000	Those two work together to build the next two.
373000	377000	Four become eight, eight become sixteen, and so on.
377000	383000	Within just about 60 doubling times, the Sun would be completely surrounded by solar panels.
383000	385000	And this can happen quickly.
385000	390000	If a square kilometer of solar collectors takes a month to build, we could be done in a decade.
390000	395000	If only our infrastructure on the planet's surface can keep up with the quickly growing budget of energy.
395000	402000	Even collecting 1% of the Sun's energy is an unbelievable change in our species' energy budget.
402000	406000	We could create the infrastructure to beam basically unlimited amounts of energy
406000	409000	around the solar system for all sorts of projects.
409000	414000	Colonies on other worlds, terraforming planets, constructing more megastructures,
414000	417000	or even traveling to other stars.
417000	421000	It could be the start of an interstellar civilization.
421000	426000	Based on physics alone, this is not just possible, but easy.
426000	432000	It's such a simple process and such a necessary step for any species to expand beyond their home planet
432000	437000	that many astronomers think there are probably Dyson spheres already out there in the Milky Way.
437000	440000	We haven't spotted any yet, but they could be there.
440000	444000	It's far from certain that humanity will ever get to this point.
444000	451000	Our attention is too often focused on short-term political gains and conflicts that will not matter in the long run.
451000	454000	But if we survive the challenges we've set ourselves,
454000	460000	we could potentially become the first species in the universe to create a structure with the scope of a star.
460000	466000	If we do it, the only limitation left will be our own imagination.
466000	473000	We've just hit you with a lot of pretty wild claims and crazy concepts.
473000	479000	If you're like us and enjoy using the power of science to determine absurd ways to destroy stuff,
479000	483000	you might want to hear how you can come up with something like that yourself.
