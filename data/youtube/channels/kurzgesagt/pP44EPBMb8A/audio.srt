1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
Human history is told by the energy we use.

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:09,000
At first we had to use our muscles, then we learned to control fire.

3
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:12,000
We industrialized the world using coal and oil,

4
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:16,000
and entered the atomic age when we learned how to split a nucleus.

5
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:21,000
At each step we increased our energy harvest to a scale never seen before,

6
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:23,000
and advanced as a species.

7
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:26,000
Currently we're slowly transitioning to renewables,

8
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:31,000
and if we're lucky, fusion energy will become viable in the future.

9
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:36,000
As humanity progresses further, if we don't destroy ourselves or our habitat,

10
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:40,000
we will likely gain complete control of our planet's resources.

11
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:46,000
At that stage, we'll probably begin to look outwards for new places to expand into.

12
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:51,000
But space is hard, and establishing a serious human presence in the solar system

13
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:54,000
will require ungodly amounts of energy.

14
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:57,000
Luckily, we know where to find it.

15
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:00,000
The sun, the ultimate source of energy.

16
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:06,000
A furnace 100 quintillion times more powerful than our most efficient nuclear reactor.

17
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:11,000
It shines with the energy of a trillion nuclear bombs per second.

18
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:13,000
So how do we get this energy?

19
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:16,000
Not some of it, all of it.

20
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:28,000
If we want to collect the most energy physically possible,

21
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:32,000
we'll have to build the largest, most ambitious structure in the universe.

22
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:33,000
The Dyson Sphere.

23
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:38,000
A megastructure that encompasses a whole star to capture its power output.

24
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:43,000
For an intelligent species, building a Dyson Sphere is a technological leap

25
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:46,000
on a par with the discovery of fire for our ancestors.

26
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:51,000
The transition from a planetary species to an interstellar species.

27
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:57,000
It would usher in an age of exploration and expansion on a scale we can barely imagine.

28
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:59,000
So, what would it look like?

29
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:03,000
A solid shell enveloping the sun is probably not the way to go.

30
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:08,000
A large rigid body like that would be vulnerable to impacts, possibly shattering.

31
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:12,000
It would be liable to drift and could crash straight into the sun.

32
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:16,000
A more viable design for a Dyson Sphere might be a Dyson Swarm,

33
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:21,000
an enormous set of orbiting panels that collect the sun's power and beam it elsewhere.

34
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:25,000
Such a swarm would give humanity basically unlimited energy.

35
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:28,000
But building it won't be easy.

36
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:32,000
The sun is very big, so we need a lot of satellites.

37
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:38,000
If each satellite is a square kilometer, we'd need around 30 quadrillion to surround the sun.

38
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:44,000
Even if they're built as lightly as possible, we need about 100 quintillion tons of material.

39
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:51,000
And then we need the energy to actually put the parts together and deliver them to their positions around the sun.

40
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:57,000
On top of all that, we need to have a permanent infrastructure set up in space to start building.

41
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:04,000
Let's assume for the purposes of this video that our descendants will take care of that and want to create the megastructure.

42
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:07,000
We can sort the challenges into three main categories.

43
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:10,000
Materials, design and energy.

44
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:18,000
To get the vast amounts of raw materials required for our Dyson Swarm, we'll have to largely disassemble a whole planet.

45
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:22,000
Of the planets available, Mercury is the best candidate.

46
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:25,000
It's the closest to the sun and very metal-rich.

47
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:29,000
Close to the sun also means less moving stuff around,

48
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:34,000
and Mercury has no atmosphere and only about a third of the surface gravity of Earth,

49
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:38,000
making it comparatively easy to launch material into space.

50
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:41,000
Next, we should consider the design of our swarm.

51
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:43,000
Simpler is better.

52
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:47,000
Conventional solar panels are far too intricate and short-lived.

53
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:52,000
Our satellites need to operate without repairs or intervention for astronomically long times,

54
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:55,000
and they need to be cheap to produce.

55
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:58,000
They're most likely going to be enormous mirrors,

56
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:04,000
which refocus sunlight to central collecting stations, like in concentrated solar power on Earth.

57
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:08,000
To build and launch them efficiently, they must be incredibly light,

58
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:12,000
made of little more than polished metal foil bound to some supports.

59
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:16,000
And last, we need the energy to build and launch the swarm itself.

60
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:21,000
Taking apart a planet and launching things into space requires an enormous amount of energy.

61
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:27,000
For example, if we used all the fossil fuels and uranium on Earth and we were perfectly efficient,

62
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:31,000
we could only launch as much mass as Mount Everest into space.

63
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:35,000
A rather meager accomplishment compared to planetary disassembly.

64
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:38,000
To get the energy needed to build a Dyson sphere,

65
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:42,000
it's almost as if you're going to need the power output of a Dyson sphere.

66
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:48,000
But that's okay. There's plenty of sunlight to be had on Mercury, so let's get to work.

67
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:52,000
Humans are expensive to keep alive and are very sensitive to the environment,

68
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:55,000
so we'd want to automate as much as possible.

69
00:04:55,000 --> 00:05:00,000
Ideally, we'd have a small crew of controllers who oversee an army of autonomous machines

70
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,000
doing the actual work.

71
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:06,000
There are four major pieces of technology required.

72
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:11,000
Solar collectors, miners, refiners, and launch equipment.

73
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:16,000
The solar collectors are going to give us the energy we need to disassemble the planet.

74
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:20,000
To start, maybe we deploy something like one square kilometer of them,

75
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:23,000
either as mirrors or as traditional solar panels.

76
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:27,000
They'll provide the energy to run our miners, which strip mine the surface of the planet,

77
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:33,000
and our refiners, which extract valuable elements and fabricate them into our swarm satellites.

78
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:37,000
To get them into space, we need a creative and efficient solution.

79
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:42,000
Rockets are too expensive and difficult to deorbit and reuse.

80
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:45,000
Instead, we'll want to use a sort of railgun,

81
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:50,000
a long electromagnetic track which launches our satellites at high speeds.

82
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:53,000
Our swarm satellites would be packed tight for launch,

83
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:56,000
unfurling like an enormous origami once in orbit.

84
00:05:56,000 --> 00:06:00,000
From this point, we can take advantage of exponential growth,

85
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:05,000
using the energy of the existing parts of the swarm to build more infrastructure on Mercury

86
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:08,000
and launch new panels faster and faster.

87
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:11,000
Each panel provides the energy to build another.

88
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:13,000
Those two work together to build the next two.

89
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:17,000
Four become eight, eight become sixteen, and so on.

90
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:23,000
Within just about 60 doubling times, the Sun would be completely surrounded by solar panels.

91
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:25,000
And this can happen quickly.

92
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:30,000
If a square kilometer of solar collectors takes a month to build, we could be done in a decade.

93
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:35,000
If only our infrastructure on the planet's surface can keep up with the quickly growing budget of energy.

94
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:42,000
Even collecting 1% of the Sun's energy is an unbelievable change in our species' energy budget.

95
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:46,000
We could create the infrastructure to beam basically unlimited amounts of energy

96
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:49,000
around the solar system for all sorts of projects.

97
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:54,000
Colonies on other worlds, terraforming planets, constructing more megastructures,

98
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:57,000
or even traveling to other stars.

99
00:06:57,000 --> 00:07:01,000
It could be the start of an interstellar civilization.

100
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:06,000
Based on physics alone, this is not just possible, but easy.

101
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:12,000
It's such a simple process and such a necessary step for any species to expand beyond their home planet

102
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:17,000
that many astronomers think there are probably Dyson spheres already out there in the Milky Way.

103
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:20,000
We haven't spotted any yet, but they could be there.

104
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:24,000
It's far from certain that humanity will ever get to this point.

105
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:31,000
Our attention is too often focused on short-term political gains and conflicts that will not matter in the long run.

106
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:34,000
But if we survive the challenges we've set ourselves,

107
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:40,000
we could potentially become the first species in the universe to create a structure with the scope of a star.

108
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:46,000
If we do it, the only limitation left will be our own imagination.

109
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:53,000
We've just hit you with a lot of pretty wild claims and crazy concepts.

110
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:59,000
If you're like us and enjoy using the power of science to determine absurd ways to destroy stuff,

111
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:03,000
you might want to hear how you can come up with something like that yourself.

112
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:07,000
Brilliant is a problem-solving website that helps you learn stuff through fun puzzles

113
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:13,000
that split up a complex problem into bite-sized chunks and build up to an interesting conclusion.

114
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:20,000
It helps you understand how science works by actually using it instead of just memorizing a bunch of stuff.

115
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:28,000
Brilliant has tons of interesting courses and puzzles on things like quantum computing, astronomy and logic, and even Dyson spheres.

116
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:36,000
If you visit brilliant.org slash nutshell or click the link in the description, you can sign up for free and learn all kinds of things.

117
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:43,000
As a bonus for Kurzgesagt viewers, the first 688 people will also get 20% off their annual membership.

118
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:47,000
With Brilliant, you can finish each day a little bit smarter,

119
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:53,000
and just maybe, you can help to expand the human species into the universe one day.

120
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:57,000
We love Dyson spheres so much that we've also made a poster about them.

121
00:08:57,000 --> 00:09:02,000
It will look pretty on your wall, but also has some information about the concept of a Dyson sphere.

122
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:08,000
A great way to start a conversation, or you can just stare at it and dream about the future.

123
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:10,000
Go get it here.
