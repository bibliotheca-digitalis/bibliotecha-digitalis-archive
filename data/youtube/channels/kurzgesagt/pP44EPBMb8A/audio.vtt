00:00.000 --> 00:04.000
Human history is told by the energy we use.

00:04.000 --> 00:09.000
At first we had to use our muscles, then we learned to control fire.

00:09.000 --> 00:12.000
We industrialized the world using coal and oil,

00:12.000 --> 00:16.000
and entered the atomic age when we learned how to split a nucleus.

00:16.000 --> 00:21.000
At each step we increased our energy harvest to a scale never seen before,

00:21.000 --> 00:23.000
and advanced as a species.

00:23.000 --> 00:26.000
Currently we're slowly transitioning to renewables,

00:26.000 --> 00:31.000
and if we're lucky, fusion energy will become viable in the future.

00:31.000 --> 00:36.000
As humanity progresses further, if we don't destroy ourselves or our habitat,

00:36.000 --> 00:40.000
we will likely gain complete control of our planet's resources.

00:40.000 --> 00:46.000
At that stage, we'll probably begin to look outwards for new places to expand into.

00:46.000 --> 00:51.000
But space is hard, and establishing a serious human presence in the solar system

00:51.000 --> 00:54.000
will require ungodly amounts of energy.

00:54.000 --> 00:57.000
Luckily, we know where to find it.

00:57.000 --> 01:00.000
The sun, the ultimate source of energy.

01:00.000 --> 01:06.000
A furnace 100 quintillion times more powerful than our most efficient nuclear reactor.

01:06.000 --> 01:11.000
It shines with the energy of a trillion nuclear bombs per second.

01:11.000 --> 01:13.000
So how do we get this energy?

01:13.000 --> 01:16.000
Not some of it, all of it.

01:25.000 --> 01:28.000
If we want to collect the most energy physically possible,

01:28.000 --> 01:32.000
we'll have to build the largest, most ambitious structure in the universe.

01:32.000 --> 01:33.000
The Dyson Sphere.

01:33.000 --> 01:38.000
A megastructure that encompasses a whole star to capture its power output.

01:38.000 --> 01:43.000
For an intelligent species, building a Dyson Sphere is a technological leap

01:43.000 --> 01:46.000
on a par with the discovery of fire for our ancestors.

01:46.000 --> 01:51.000
The transition from a planetary species to an interstellar species.

01:51.000 --> 01:57.000
It would usher in an age of exploration and expansion on a scale we can barely imagine.

01:57.000 --> 01:59.000
So, what would it look like?

01:59.000 --> 02:03.000
A solid shell enveloping the sun is probably not the way to go.

02:03.000 --> 02:08.000
A large rigid body like that would be vulnerable to impacts, possibly shattering.

02:08.000 --> 02:12.000
It would be liable to drift and could crash straight into the sun.

02:12.000 --> 02:16.000
A more viable design for a Dyson Sphere might be a Dyson Swarm,

02:16.000 --> 02:21.000
an enormous set of orbiting panels that collect the sun's power and beam it elsewhere.

02:21.000 --> 02:25.000
Such a swarm would give humanity basically unlimited energy.

02:25.000 --> 02:28.000
But building it won't be easy.

02:28.000 --> 02:32.000
The sun is very big, so we need a lot of satellites.

02:32.000 --> 02:38.000
If each satellite is a square kilometer, we'd need around 30 quadrillion to surround the sun.

02:38.000 --> 02:44.000
Even if they're built as lightly as possible, we need about 100 quintillion tons of material.

02:44.000 --> 02:51.000
And then we need the energy to actually put the parts together and deliver them to their positions around the sun.

02:51.000 --> 02:57.000
On top of all that, we need to have a permanent infrastructure set up in space to start building.

02:57.000 --> 03:04.000
Let's assume for the purposes of this video that our descendants will take care of that and want to create the megastructure.

03:04.000 --> 03:07.000
We can sort the challenges into three main categories.

03:07.000 --> 03:10.000
Materials, design and energy.

03:11.000 --> 03:18.000
To get the vast amounts of raw materials required for our Dyson Swarm, we'll have to largely disassemble a whole planet.

03:18.000 --> 03:22.000
Of the planets available, Mercury is the best candidate.

03:22.000 --> 03:25.000
It's the closest to the sun and very metal-rich.

03:25.000 --> 03:29.000
Close to the sun also means less moving stuff around,

03:29.000 --> 03:34.000
and Mercury has no atmosphere and only about a third of the surface gravity of Earth,

03:34.000 --> 03:38.000
making it comparatively easy to launch material into space.

03:38.000 --> 03:41.000
Next, we should consider the design of our swarm.

03:41.000 --> 03:43.000
Simpler is better.

03:43.000 --> 03:47.000
Conventional solar panels are far too intricate and short-lived.

03:47.000 --> 03:52.000
Our satellites need to operate without repairs or intervention for astronomically long times,

03:52.000 --> 03:55.000
and they need to be cheap to produce.

03:55.000 --> 03:58.000
They're most likely going to be enormous mirrors,

03:58.000 --> 04:04.000
which refocus sunlight to central collecting stations, like in concentrated solar power on Earth.

04:04.000 --> 04:08.000
To build and launch them efficiently, they must be incredibly light,

04:08.000 --> 04:12.000
made of little more than polished metal foil bound to some supports.

04:12.000 --> 04:16.000
And last, we need the energy to build and launch the swarm itself.

04:16.000 --> 04:21.000
Taking apart a planet and launching things into space requires an enormous amount of energy.

04:21.000 --> 04:27.000
For example, if we used all the fossil fuels and uranium on Earth and we were perfectly efficient,

04:27.000 --> 04:31.000
we could only launch as much mass as Mount Everest into space.

04:31.000 --> 04:35.000
A rather meager accomplishment compared to planetary disassembly.

04:35.000 --> 04:38.000
To get the energy needed to build a Dyson sphere,

04:38.000 --> 04:42.000
it's almost as if you're going to need the power output of a Dyson sphere.

04:42.000 --> 04:48.000
But that's okay. There's plenty of sunlight to be had on Mercury, so let's get to work.

04:48.000 --> 04:52.000
Humans are expensive to keep alive and are very sensitive to the environment,

04:52.000 --> 04:55.000
so we'd want to automate as much as possible.

04:55.000 --> 05:00.000
Ideally, we'd have a small crew of controllers who oversee an army of autonomous machines

05:00.000 --> 05:02.000
doing the actual work.

05:02.000 --> 05:06.000
There are four major pieces of technology required.

05:06.000 --> 05:11.000
Solar collectors, miners, refiners, and launch equipment.

05:11.000 --> 05:16.000
The solar collectors are going to give us the energy we need to disassemble the planet.

05:16.000 --> 05:20.000
To start, maybe we deploy something like one square kilometer of them,

05:20.000 --> 05:23.000
either as mirrors or as traditional solar panels.

05:23.000 --> 05:27.000
They'll provide the energy to run our miners, which strip mine the surface of the planet,

05:27.000 --> 05:33.000
and our refiners, which extract valuable elements and fabricate them into our swarm satellites.

05:33.000 --> 05:37.000
To get them into space, we need a creative and efficient solution.

05:37.000 --> 05:42.000
Rockets are too expensive and difficult to deorbit and reuse.

05:42.000 --> 05:45.000
Instead, we'll want to use a sort of railgun,

05:45.000 --> 05:50.000
a long electromagnetic track which launches our satellites at high speeds.

05:50.000 --> 05:53.000
Our swarm satellites would be packed tight for launch,

05:53.000 --> 05:56.000
unfurling like an enormous origami once in orbit.

05:56.000 --> 06:00.000
From this point, we can take advantage of exponential growth,

06:00.000 --> 06:05.000
using the energy of the existing parts of the swarm to build more infrastructure on Mercury

06:05.000 --> 06:08.000
and launch new panels faster and faster.

06:08.000 --> 06:11.000
Each panel provides the energy to build another.

06:11.000 --> 06:13.000
Those two work together to build the next two.

06:13.000 --> 06:17.000
Four become eight, eight become sixteen, and so on.

06:17.000 --> 06:23.000
Within just about 60 doubling times, the Sun would be completely surrounded by solar panels.

06:23.000 --> 06:25.000
And this can happen quickly.

06:25.000 --> 06:30.000
If a square kilometer of solar collectors takes a month to build, we could be done in a decade.

06:30.000 --> 06:35.000
If only our infrastructure on the planet's surface can keep up with the quickly growing budget of energy.

06:35.000 --> 06:42.000
Even collecting 1% of the Sun's energy is an unbelievable change in our species' energy budget.

06:42.000 --> 06:46.000
We could create the infrastructure to beam basically unlimited amounts of energy

06:46.000 --> 06:49.000
around the solar system for all sorts of projects.

06:49.000 --> 06:54.000
Colonies on other worlds, terraforming planets, constructing more megastructures,

06:54.000 --> 06:57.000
or even traveling to other stars.

06:57.000 --> 07:01.000
It could be the start of an interstellar civilization.

07:01.000 --> 07:06.000
Based on physics alone, this is not just possible, but easy.

07:06.000 --> 07:12.000
It's such a simple process and such a necessary step for any species to expand beyond their home planet

07:12.000 --> 07:17.000
that many astronomers think there are probably Dyson spheres already out there in the Milky Way.

07:17.000 --> 07:20.000
We haven't spotted any yet, but they could be there.

07:20.000 --> 07:24.000
It's far from certain that humanity will ever get to this point.

07:24.000 --> 07:31.000
Our attention is too often focused on short-term political gains and conflicts that will not matter in the long run.

07:31.000 --> 07:34.000
But if we survive the challenges we've set ourselves,

07:34.000 --> 07:40.000
we could potentially become the first species in the universe to create a structure with the scope of a star.

07:40.000 --> 07:46.000
If we do it, the only limitation left will be our own imagination.

07:46.000 --> 07:53.000
We've just hit you with a lot of pretty wild claims and crazy concepts.

07:53.000 --> 07:59.000
If you're like us and enjoy using the power of science to determine absurd ways to destroy stuff,

07:59.000 --> 08:03.000
you might want to hear how you can come up with something like that yourself.

08:03.000 --> 08:07.000
Brilliant is a problem-solving website that helps you learn stuff through fun puzzles

08:07.000 --> 08:13.000
that split up a complex problem into bite-sized chunks and build up to an interesting conclusion.

08:13.000 --> 08:20.000
It helps you understand how science works by actually using it instead of just memorizing a bunch of stuff.

08:20.000 --> 08:28.000
Brilliant has tons of interesting courses and puzzles on things like quantum computing, astronomy and logic, and even Dyson spheres.

08:28.000 --> 08:36.000

08:43.000 --> 08:47.000
With Brilliant, you can finish each day a little bit smarter,

08:47.000 --> 08:53.000
and just maybe, you can help to expand the human species into the universe one day.

08:53.000 --> 08:57.000
We love Dyson spheres so much that we've also made a poster about them.

08:57.000 --> 09:02.000
It will look pretty on your wall, but also has some information about the concept of a Dyson sphere.

09:02.000 --> 09:08.000
A great way to start a conversation, or you can just stare at it and dream about the future.

09:08.000 --> 09:10.000
