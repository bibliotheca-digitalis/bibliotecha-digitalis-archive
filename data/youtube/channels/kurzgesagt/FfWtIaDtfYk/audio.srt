1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,840
The universe is pretty big and very strange. Hundreds of billions of galaxies with sextillions

2
00:00:08,840 --> 00:00:15,900
of stars and planets, and in the middle of it all, there's Earth with you and us. But as enormous as

3
00:00:15,900 --> 00:00:21,920
the universe seems looking up, it seems to get even larger when you start looking down. You are

4
00:00:21,920 --> 00:00:28,960
towering over worlds within worlds within worlds, each in plain sight and yet hidden from your

5
00:00:28,960 --> 00:00:35,080
experience. Let's go on a journey. We'll start in a park about a thousand meters long, enough

6
00:00:35,080 --> 00:00:40,280
for a 15-minute walk. Every time we click this magic button, we'll become a thousand times

7
00:00:40,280 --> 00:00:48,040
smaller. Please slip into this magic science suit so you don't die and can still see. Ready? Let's

8
00:00:48,040 --> 00:01:02,760
go. The miniature realm. You are the size of a grain of sand just two millimeters high,

9
00:01:02,760 --> 00:01:08,360
standing on a blade of grass that seems as tall as an eight-story building to you. A square meter

10
00:01:08,360 --> 00:01:14,600
of lawn is now a dense metropolitan area with 100,000 blades or two Manhattan's worth of grass

11
00:01:14,600 --> 00:01:19,920
towers. From your new tiny perspective, the part that you could quickly stroll through before is

12
00:01:19,920 --> 00:01:27,320
now the size of France. Crossing it would take at least a week. Human-sized humans loom over you,

13
00:01:27,320 --> 00:01:34,400
four times taller than the Empire State Building, their steps falling from horizon to horizon. A bee

14
00:01:34,400 --> 00:01:40,400
the size of a helicopter lands near you, making the ground shake as its hairy carapace vibrates

15
00:01:40,480 --> 00:01:46,840
with each wing beat. You try to escape, but are barely able to move because the air is so gooey.

16
00:01:46,840 --> 00:01:52,840
Before you click the button, air resistance was barely noticeable, but as you're now a thousand

17
00:01:52,840 --> 00:01:58,200
times smaller, it's as if the air has become a thousand times denser. It feels like you're moving

18
00:01:58,200 --> 00:02:04,480
through honey. Flying insects like bees use this to their advantage. Their wings are not made for

19
00:02:04,480 --> 00:02:10,280
gliding, but like paddles that row through the air. Scaled up to human size, the bee would outrun a

20
00:02:10,280 --> 00:02:14,920
Concorde jet, except it couldn't even take off because it would be too heavy for its wings.

21
00:02:14,920 --> 00:02:23,600
The microscopic realm. You've entered the microscopic realm and are now less than two

22
00:02:23,600 --> 00:02:29,320
micrometers tall, about the size of an E. coli bacteria. From your new tiny perspective,

23
00:02:29,320 --> 00:02:34,720
the park you started in is now a million kilometers wide to you. If you walked nonstop,

24
00:02:34,760 --> 00:02:40,640
it would take some 25 years to cross it. It's hard to grasp just how huge the microscopic

25
00:02:40,640 --> 00:02:46,240
world is to its tiny inhabitants. The giant bee that was close a moment ago is now the size of

26
00:02:46,240 --> 00:02:53,720
Mount Everest towering high into the sky, but alive, humming and vibrating. The air here feels

27
00:02:53,720 --> 00:02:59,560
almost solid to you. On the human scale, it will be as viscous as lava, extremely hard to push

28
00:02:59,560 --> 00:03:06,000
through. The blade of grass now expands so far you can't see its edges, stretching as wide as

29
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:10,920
Paris would to a regular-sized human. You see valleys that look like dried-up riverbeds,

30
00:03:10,920 --> 00:03:16,960
dead patches like deserts, and giant craters left behind by voracious aphids. But if you look

31
00:03:16,960 --> 00:03:22,600
closely, this is not terrain. These are rows of individual cells, each the size of a house,

32
00:03:22,600 --> 00:03:28,880
with hard exteriors like glass shells. Every few cells there are huge openings called stomata,

33
00:03:28,880 --> 00:03:35,880
like mouths sucking in air and blowing out oxygen. Suddenly, the gigantic bee begins to move. A

34
00:03:35,880 --> 00:03:42,720
construct made of rigid pieces that slide against each other like a suit of armor. It takes off to

35
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:47,600
escape a drop of water the size of an asteroid that fell from another blade of grass and is now

36
00:03:47,600 --> 00:03:54,080
rushing at you at breathtaking speeds. You brace for impact, but instead of feeling a strong punch,

37
00:03:54,080 --> 00:03:59,880
you just get sucked in. You try to swim, but the water feels thick and sticky and holds onto your

38
00:03:59,880 --> 00:04:06,360
limbs like glue. Air molecules are free spirits, while water molecules act more like social

39
00:04:06,360 --> 00:04:11,240
creatures that group together whenever possible. They pull on each other and create a relatively

40
00:04:11,240 --> 00:04:16,920
strong cohesive force that traps you. You can't help it, but you're still moving, tumbling in all

41
00:04:16,920 --> 00:04:22,160
directions, helplessly dragged along by an invisible current. Floating in this miniature

42
00:04:22,160 --> 00:04:28,240
lake are tens of thousands of microorganisms. They take on many forms, viruses the size of

43
00:04:28,240 --> 00:04:33,480
tennis balls float around you aimlessly. Others, like Euglena oxyuric cells, pass you like freight

44
00:04:33,480 --> 00:04:39,720
trains. But most look like oily jellyfish the size of a car, sporting long tentacles that act

45
00:04:39,720 --> 00:04:46,080
like supercharged propellers. Despite the water holding onto them like glue, some move hundreds

46
00:04:46,080 --> 00:04:52,080
of body lengths per second, equivalent to a person shoveling through mud at over 600 kilometers an

47
00:04:52,080 --> 00:04:58,760
hour. However, bacteria weigh so little and water is so viscous that they basically have no inertia.

48
00:04:58,760 --> 00:05:05,040
There is no gliding on this scale. The result is a weird jerky motion that's hard to keep track of.

49
00:05:05,040 --> 00:05:12,840
Maybe we can learn more about this strange motion if we go even deeper. The molecule realm. You've

50
00:05:12,880 --> 00:05:18,580
become the size of a molecule, just under two nanometers wide. At your new tiny scale,

51
00:05:18,580 --> 00:05:24,240
the droplet now seems as big as the moon to a regular human. The blade of grass it rests on

52
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:29,280
could reach from the tip of Alaska to the end of Australia. And the park is now almost the size

53
00:05:29,280 --> 00:05:36,400
of the solar system. But instead of mostly empty space, it is filled with stuff. Everywhere you

54
00:05:36,400 --> 00:05:41,480
look, there are innumerable amounts of molecules and atoms. The rigid walls of the grass cells

55
00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:47,720
beneath you are clearly vibrating, rippling with waves of energy. The water droplet contains nearly

56
00:05:47,720 --> 00:05:53,720
a sextillion water molecules that are all in motion. Water is actually a storm of H2O molecules

57
00:05:53,720 --> 00:05:58,920
smashing into each other hundreds of trillions of times a second. Each of them is moving at speeds

58
00:05:58,920 --> 00:06:04,760
of around 2,300 kilometers an hour and bombard their surroundings mercilessly, sending small

59
00:06:04,760 --> 00:06:10,400
objects hurtling in all directions. This is the source of the invisible current that you noticed

60
00:06:10,400 --> 00:06:16,280
when you were 1000 times larger. scaling the speed up to the human scale is impossible as a

61
00:06:16,280 --> 00:06:22,960
human sized molecule would be 2000 times faster than the speed of light. All this furious motion

62
00:06:22,960 --> 00:06:28,360
comes from heat. Heat is a bit abstract at our human scale, where you touch something and get

63
00:06:28,360 --> 00:06:35,080
a vague sense of whether it's hot or cold. But down here, you really feel what heat is the motion

64
00:06:35,080 --> 00:06:42,360
of molecules vibrating, twisting and colliding as if they're inside a furious ball pit. When

65
00:06:42,360 --> 00:06:48,120
these molecules lose heat, they move more slowly and collide less often. When they gain heat,

66
00:06:48,120 --> 00:06:53,080
they speed up and smash together with renewed further temperature is basically the measure of

67
00:06:53,080 --> 00:06:59,040
the average speed of these fantastic dancers performing all day. Suddenly, a molecule hits

68
00:06:59,040 --> 00:07:04,840
you especially hard, and you're catapulted out of the water droplet into the air again. And here,

69
00:07:05,080 --> 00:07:13,400
you see something unexpected. The stuff between the air molecules, nothing between the molecules

70
00:07:13,400 --> 00:07:18,480
that make up the air, there is a vacuum. On average, a molecule in the air travels for

71
00:07:18,480 --> 00:07:23,960
about 60 nanometers, which is about the length of a hockey rink if it were the size of a human. If

72
00:07:23,960 --> 00:07:27,960
we were to compress all the molecules and atoms buzzing around in the room you're watching this

73
00:07:27,960 --> 00:07:35,560
in, they would only film about 0.1% of its volume. 99.9% of the space around you is a vacuum,

74
00:07:35,560 --> 00:07:40,380
you just don't notice it. Which also means that every time you take a breath, you breathe in

75
00:07:40,380 --> 00:07:47,960
mostly nothing with a few atoms. The subatomic realm. At your size of under two picometers,

76
00:07:47,960 --> 00:07:53,760
scale starts to lose its meaning. A human would be nearly 2 billion kilometers tall relative to

77
00:07:53,760 --> 00:07:59,600
you, so large they could stretch their arms from the sun to Saturn. An atomic nucleus would be the

78
00:07:59,600 --> 00:08:06,000
size of a grain of sand you could hold on the tip of your finger. That grain holds 99.97% of

79
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:11,600
the atoms mass. The rest, a sphere of influence about as large as the Eiffel Tower from your

80
00:08:11,600 --> 00:08:16,720
perspective, is filled with an electron cloud. That's basically all the places where electrons

81
00:08:16,720 --> 00:08:22,400
might be at any given moment in time. Electrons are shape shifters that morph around outside a

82
00:08:22,400 --> 00:08:28,640
nucleus, creating a new and vibrating mess of different shapes with every new moment. Unlike

83
00:08:28,640 --> 00:08:35,520
the graceful motion of planets, the atomic nuclei are chaotic blurs. They bulge, roll, quiver, and

84
00:08:35,520 --> 00:08:41,160
breathe. They hold back the same energy that powers nuclear bombs, and it doesn't let them sit

85
00:08:41,160 --> 00:08:49,360
still. They twist and vibrate six-dillions of times a second. It's time to end our journey and return

86
00:08:49,360 --> 00:08:59,560
to... What you doing? Stop it! The smallest place. We have reached the bottom, the border between

87
00:08:59,560 --> 00:09:06,320
reality and unreality. The scale here is the Planck length, which is the distance light travels in a

88
00:09:06,320 --> 00:09:12,880
Planck time. Planck time is the time it takes light to travel a Planck length. Hmm, okay. None

89
00:09:12,880 --> 00:09:19,280
of our models of the universe make sense at scales smaller than this, so for now, this is it. We

90
00:09:19,280 --> 00:09:24,320
think that down here, particles bubble into existence and then spontaneously disappear,

91
00:09:24,320 --> 00:09:31,640
creating a quantum foam of unimaginable energy. Can we go even smaller? We don't know. It's time

92
00:09:31,640 --> 00:09:55,760
to return. If you look up, the universe is large and strange, so incredibly large and strange. But

93
00:09:55,760 --> 00:10:02,640
if you look down into the tiny and extremely tiny, the universe seems even larger and even

94
00:10:02,640 --> 00:10:09,520
stranger. In the end, the perfect place might be where you are right now. Not too big, not too

95
00:10:09,520 --> 00:10:35,800
small. I'm ready. We did it. It worked. Right under our noses, there's so much hidden that we

96
00:10:35,800 --> 00:10:42,040
never get to see with our own eyes. Entire realms of bizarre structures and outlandish creatures.

97
00:10:42,040 --> 00:10:48,880
What a magical place this is. A forest of slime molds, single-celled organisms that work together

98
00:10:48,880 --> 00:10:53,960
and form fungus-like structures. But we don't have time to hang out with these calm fellows any

99
00:10:53,960 --> 00:11:00,640
longer. Shh, now we're in the kingdom of the mighty tardigrades. Don't disturb them in their

100
00:11:00,680 --> 00:11:05,800
death-like slumber. Don't worry though, they'll wake up once the conditions are less rough. Oh,

101
00:11:05,800 --> 00:11:13,240
didn't mean to get in the way. Your cells are hustling to keep you alive, coordinating myriads

102
00:11:13,240 --> 00:11:19,480
of proteins. This might be the weirdest place yet, with no up or down. There's way too much going on,

103
00:11:19,480 --> 00:11:27,320
better move on. Now we're inside one of the parts that allow you to watch this video. The structure

104
00:11:27,320 --> 00:11:34,040
of a microchip is so small, it nearly breaks the rules of the quantum realm. Wait, something's

105
00:11:34,040 --> 00:11:44,160
happening. These hidden worlds are all part of our 12,023 human-era calendar. This time, you can join

106
00:11:44,160 --> 00:11:50,160
us on a journey through the microcosm. With each turn of the page, you will reveal a new world you

107
00:11:50,160 --> 00:11:56,720
didn't know existed right beneath your feet. You know the drill by now. As always, it's a super

108
00:11:56,760 --> 00:12:02,540
high-quality calendar, very shiny, and only available for a short time. We also have a

109
00:12:02,540 --> 00:12:07,600
few special deals for you in our shop. The calendar is a true piece of Kurzgesagt you can

110
00:12:07,600 --> 00:12:13,180
take home with you. And we say this every year, but it's true, every calendar purchase directly

111
00:12:13,180 --> 00:12:19,280
supports what we do here at Kurzgesagt. And that's not just creating videos, but sparking curiosity

112
00:12:19,280 --> 00:12:24,960
all around the world. So because of you, we can spread knowledge and ignite an appreciation for

113
00:12:24,960 --> 00:12:30,120
space, nature, and life in people everywhere. Thank you so much for making this possible.

114
00:12:30,120 --> 00:12:35,400
Have a wonderful 12,023. See you down in January.
