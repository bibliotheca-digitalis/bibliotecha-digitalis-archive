0	8840	The universe is pretty big and very strange. Hundreds of billions of galaxies with sextillions
8840	15900	of stars and planets, and in the middle of it all, there's Earth with you and us. But as enormous as
15900	21920	the universe seems looking up, it seems to get even larger when you start looking down. You are
21920	28960	towering over worlds within worlds within worlds, each in plain sight and yet hidden from your
28960	35080	experience. Let's go on a journey. We'll start in a park about a thousand meters long, enough
35080	40280	for a 15-minute walk. Every time we click this magic button, we'll become a thousand times
40280	48040	smaller. Please slip into this magic science suit so you don't die and can still see. Ready? Let's
48040	62760	go. The miniature realm. You are the size of a grain of sand just two millimeters high,
62760	68360	standing on a blade of grass that seems as tall as an eight-story building to you. A square meter
68360	74600	of lawn is now a dense metropolitan area with 100,000 blades or two Manhattan's worth of grass
74600	79920	towers. From your new tiny perspective, the part that you could quickly stroll through before is
79920	87320	now the size of France. Crossing it would take at least a week. Human-sized humans loom over you,
87320	94400	four times taller than the Empire State Building, their steps falling from horizon to horizon. A bee
94400	100400	the size of a helicopter lands near you, making the ground shake as its hairy carapace vibrates
100480	106840	with each wing beat. You try to escape, but are barely able to move because the air is so gooey.
106840	112840	Before you click the button, air resistance was barely noticeable, but as you're now a thousand
112840	118200	times smaller, it's as if the air has become a thousand times denser. It feels like you're moving
118200	124480	through honey. Flying insects like bees use this to their advantage. Their wings are not made for
124480	130280	gliding, but like paddles that row through the air. Scaled up to human size, the bee would outrun a
130280	134920	Concorde jet, except it couldn't even take off because it would be too heavy for its wings.
134920	143600	The microscopic realm. You've entered the microscopic realm and are now less than two
143600	149320	micrometers tall, about the size of an E. coli bacteria. From your new tiny perspective,
149320	154720	the park you started in is now a million kilometers wide to you. If you walked nonstop,
154760	160640	it would take some 25 years to cross it. It's hard to grasp just how huge the microscopic
160640	166240	world is to its tiny inhabitants. The giant bee that was close a moment ago is now the size of
166240	173720	Mount Everest towering high into the sky, but alive, humming and vibrating. The air here feels
173720	179560	almost solid to you. On the human scale, it will be as viscous as lava, extremely hard to push
179560	186000	through. The blade of grass now expands so far you can't see its edges, stretching as wide as
186000	190920	Paris would to a regular-sized human. You see valleys that look like dried-up riverbeds,
190920	196960	dead patches like deserts, and giant craters left behind by voracious aphids. But if you look
196960	202600	closely, this is not terrain. These are rows of individual cells, each the size of a house,
202600	208880	with hard exteriors like glass shells. Every few cells there are huge openings called stomata,
208880	215880	like mouths sucking in air and blowing out oxygen. Suddenly, the gigantic bee begins to move. A
215880	222720	construct made of rigid pieces that slide against each other like a suit of armor. It takes off to
222720	227600	escape a drop of water the size of an asteroid that fell from another blade of grass and is now
227600	234080	rushing at you at breathtaking speeds. You brace for impact, but instead of feeling a strong punch,
234080	239880	you just get sucked in. You try to swim, but the water feels thick and sticky and holds onto your
239880	246360	limbs like glue. Air molecules are free spirits, while water molecules act more like social
246360	251240	creatures that group together whenever possible. They pull on each other and create a relatively
251240	256920	strong cohesive force that traps you. You can't help it, but you're still moving, tumbling in all
256920	262160	directions, helplessly dragged along by an invisible current. Floating in this miniature
262160	268240	lake are tens of thousands of microorganisms. They take on many forms, viruses the size of
268240	273480	tennis balls float around you aimlessly. Others, like Euglena oxyuric cells, pass you like freight
273480	279720	trains. But most look like oily jellyfish the size of a car, sporting long tentacles that act
279720	286080	like supercharged propellers. Despite the water holding onto them like glue, some move hundreds
286080	292080	of body lengths per second, equivalent to a person shoveling through mud at over 600 kilometers an
292080	298760	hour. However, bacteria weigh so little and water is so viscous that they basically have no inertia.
298760	305040	There is no gliding on this scale. The result is a weird jerky motion that's hard to keep track of.
305040	312840	Maybe we can learn more about this strange motion if we go even deeper. The molecule realm. You've
312880	318580	become the size of a molecule, just under two nanometers wide. At your new tiny scale,
318580	324240	the droplet now seems as big as the moon to a regular human. The blade of grass it rests on
324240	329280	could reach from the tip of Alaska to the end of Australia. And the park is now almost the size
329280	336400	of the solar system. But instead of mostly empty space, it is filled with stuff. Everywhere you
336400	341480	look, there are innumerable amounts of molecules and atoms. The rigid walls of the grass cells
341600	347720	beneath you are clearly vibrating, rippling with waves of energy. The water droplet contains nearly
347720	353720	a sextillion water molecules that are all in motion. Water is actually a storm of H2O molecules
353720	358920	smashing into each other hundreds of trillions of times a second. Each of them is moving at speeds
358920	364760	of around 2,300 kilometers an hour and bombard their surroundings mercilessly, sending small
364760	370400	objects hurtling in all directions. This is the source of the invisible current that you noticed
370400	376280	when you were 1000 times larger. scaling the speed up to the human scale is impossible as a
376280	382960	human sized molecule would be 2000 times faster than the speed of light. All this furious motion
382960	388360	comes from heat. Heat is a bit abstract at our human scale, where you touch something and get
388360	395080	a vague sense of whether it's hot or cold. But down here, you really feel what heat is the motion
395080	402360	of molecules vibrating, twisting and colliding as if they're inside a furious ball pit. When
402360	408120	these molecules lose heat, they move more slowly and collide less often. When they gain heat,
408120	413080	they speed up and smash together with renewed further temperature is basically the measure of
413080	419040	the average speed of these fantastic dancers performing all day. Suddenly, a molecule hits
419040	424840	you especially hard, and you're catapulted out of the water droplet into the air again. And here,
425080	433400	you see something unexpected. The stuff between the air molecules, nothing between the molecules
433400	438480	that make up the air, there is a vacuum. On average, a molecule in the air travels for
438480	443960	about 60 nanometers, which is about the length of a hockey rink if it were the size of a human. If
443960	447960	we were to compress all the molecules and atoms buzzing around in the room you're watching this
447960	455560	in, they would only film about 0.1% of its volume. 99.9% of the space around you is a vacuum,
455560	460380	you just don't notice it. Which also means that every time you take a breath, you breathe in
460380	467960	mostly nothing with a few atoms. The subatomic realm. At your size of under two picometers,
467960	473760	scale starts to lose its meaning. A human would be nearly 2 billion kilometers tall relative to
473760	479600	you, so large they could stretch their arms from the sun to Saturn. An atomic nucleus would be the
479600	486000	size of a grain of sand you could hold on the tip of your finger. That grain holds 99.97% of
486000	491600	the atoms mass. The rest, a sphere of influence about as large as the Eiffel Tower from your
491600	496720	perspective, is filled with an electron cloud. That's basically all the places where electrons
496720	502400	might be at any given moment in time. Electrons are shape shifters that morph around outside a
502400	508640	nucleus, creating a new and vibrating mess of different shapes with every new moment. Unlike
508640	515520	the graceful motion of planets, the atomic nuclei are chaotic blurs. They bulge, roll, quiver, and
515520	521160	breathe. They hold back the same energy that powers nuclear bombs, and it doesn't let them sit
521160	529360	still. They twist and vibrate six-dillions of times a second. It's time to end our journey and return
529360	539560	to... What you doing? Stop it! The smallest place. We have reached the bottom, the border between
539560	546320	reality and unreality. The scale here is the Planck length, which is the distance light travels in a
546320	552880	Planck time. Planck time is the time it takes light to travel a Planck length. Hmm, okay. None
552880	559280	of our models of the universe make sense at scales smaller than this, so for now, this is it. We
559280	564320	think that down here, particles bubble into existence and then spontaneously disappear,
564320	571640	creating a quantum foam of unimaginable energy. Can we go even smaller? We don't know. It's time
571640	595760	to return. If you look up, the universe is large and strange, so incredibly large and strange. But
595760	602640	if you look down into the tiny and extremely tiny, the universe seems even larger and even
602640	609520	stranger. In the end, the perfect place might be where you are right now. Not too big, not too
609520	635800	small. I'm ready. We did it. It worked. Right under our noses, there's so much hidden that we
635800	642040	never get to see with our own eyes. Entire realms of bizarre structures and outlandish creatures.
642040	648880	What a magical place this is. A forest of slime molds, single-celled organisms that work together
648880	653960	and form fungus-like structures. But we don't have time to hang out with these calm fellows any
653960	660640	longer. Shh, now we're in the kingdom of the mighty tardigrades. Don't disturb them in their
660680	665800	death-like slumber. Don't worry though, they'll wake up once the conditions are less rough. Oh,
665800	673240	didn't mean to get in the way. Your cells are hustling to keep you alive, coordinating myriads
673240	679480	of proteins. This might be the weirdest place yet, with no up or down. There's way too much going on,
679480	687320	better move on. Now we're inside one of the parts that allow you to watch this video. The structure
687320	694040	of a microchip is so small, it nearly breaks the rules of the quantum realm. Wait, something's
694040	704160	happening. These hidden worlds are all part of our 12,023 human-era calendar. This time, you can join
704160	710160	us on a journey through the microcosm. With each turn of the page, you will reveal a new world you
710160	716720	didn't know existed right beneath your feet. You know the drill by now. As always, it's a super
716760	722540	high-quality calendar, very shiny, and only available for a short time. We also have a
722540	727600	few special deals for you in our shop. The calendar is a true piece of Kurzgesagt you can
727600	733180	take home with you. And we say this every year, but it's true, every calendar purchase directly
733180	739280	supports what we do here at Kurzgesagt. And that's not just creating videos, but sparking curiosity
739280	744960	all around the world. So because of you, we can spread knowledge and ignite an appreciation for
744960	750120	space, nature, and life in people everywhere. Thank you so much for making this possible.
750120	755400	Have a wonderful 12,023. See you down in January.
