00:00.000 --> 00:08.840
The universe is pretty big and very strange. Hundreds of billions of galaxies with sextillions

00:08.840 --> 00:15.900
of stars and planets, and in the middle of it all, there's Earth with you and us. But as enormous as

00:15.900 --> 00:21.920
the universe seems looking up, it seems to get even larger when you start looking down. You are

00:21.920 --> 00:28.960
towering over worlds within worlds within worlds, each in plain sight and yet hidden from your

00:28.960 --> 00:35.080
experience. Let's go on a journey. We'll start in a park about a thousand meters long, enough

00:35.080 --> 00:40.280
for a 15-minute walk. Every time we click this magic button, we'll become a thousand times

00:40.280 --> 00:48.040
smaller. Please slip into this magic science suit so you don't die and can still see. Ready? Let's

00:48.040 --> 01:02.760
go. The miniature realm. You are the size of a grain of sand just two millimeters high,

01:02.760 --> 01:08.360
standing on a blade of grass that seems as tall as an eight-story building to you. A square meter

01:08.360 --> 01:14.600
of lawn is now a dense metropolitan area with 100,000 blades or two Manhattan's worth of grass

01:14.600 --> 01:19.920
towers. From your new tiny perspective, the part that you could quickly stroll through before is

01:19.920 --> 01:27.320
now the size of France. Crossing it would take at least a week. Human-sized humans loom over you,

01:27.320 --> 01:34.400
four times taller than the Empire State Building, their steps falling from horizon to horizon. A bee

01:34.400 --> 01:40.400
the size of a helicopter lands near you, making the ground shake as its hairy carapace vibrates

01:40.480 --> 01:46.840
with each wing beat. You try to escape, but are barely able to move because the air is so gooey.

01:46.840 --> 01:52.840
Before you click the button, air resistance was barely noticeable, but as you're now a thousand

01:52.840 --> 01:58.200
times smaller, it's as if the air has become a thousand times denser. It feels like you're moving

01:58.200 --> 02:04.480
through honey. Flying insects like bees use this to their advantage. Their wings are not made for

02:04.480 --> 02:10.280
gliding, but like paddles that row through the air. Scaled up to human size, the bee would outrun a

02:10.280 --> 02:14.920
Concorde jet, except it couldn't even take off because it would be too heavy for its wings.

02:14.920 --> 02:23.600
The microscopic realm. You've entered the microscopic realm and are now less than two

02:23.600 --> 02:29.320
micrometers tall, about the size of an E. coli bacteria. From your new tiny perspective,

02:29.320 --> 02:34.720
the park you started in is now a million kilometers wide to you. If you walked nonstop,

02:34.760 --> 02:40.640
it would take some 25 years to cross it. It's hard to grasp just how huge the microscopic

02:40.640 --> 02:46.240
world is to its tiny inhabitants. The giant bee that was close a moment ago is now the size of

02:46.240 --> 02:53.720
Mount Everest towering high into the sky, but alive, humming and vibrating. The air here feels

02:53.720 --> 02:59.560
almost solid to you. On the human scale, it will be as viscous as lava, extremely hard to push

02:59.560 --> 03:06.000
through. The blade of grass now expands so far you can't see its edges, stretching as wide as

03:06.000 --> 03:10.920
Paris would to a regular-sized human. You see valleys that look like dried-up riverbeds,

03:10.920 --> 03:16.960
dead patches like deserts, and giant craters left behind by voracious aphids. But if you look

03:16.960 --> 03:22.600
closely, this is not terrain. These are rows of individual cells, each the size of a house,

03:22.600 --> 03:28.880
with hard exteriors like glass shells. Every few cells there are huge openings called stomata,

03:28.880 --> 03:35.880
like mouths sucking in air and blowing out oxygen. Suddenly, the gigantic bee begins to move. A

03:35.880 --> 03:42.720
construct made of rigid pieces that slide against each other like a suit of armor. It takes off to

03:42.720 --> 03:47.600
escape a drop of water the size of an asteroid that fell from another blade of grass and is now

03:47.600 --> 03:54.080
rushing at you at breathtaking speeds. You brace for impact, but instead of feeling a strong punch,

03:54.080 --> 03:59.880
you just get sucked in. You try to swim, but the water feels thick and sticky and holds onto your

03:59.880 --> 04:06.360
limbs like glue. Air molecules are free spirits, while water molecules act more like social

04:06.360 --> 04:11.240
creatures that group together whenever possible. They pull on each other and create a relatively

04:11.240 --> 04:16.920
strong cohesive force that traps you. You can't help it, but you're still moving, tumbling in all

04:16.920 --> 04:22.160
directions, helplessly dragged along by an invisible current. Floating in this miniature

04:22.160 --> 04:28.240
lake are tens of thousands of microorganisms. They take on many forms, viruses the size of

04:28.240 --> 04:33.480
tennis balls float around you aimlessly. Others, like Euglena oxyuric cells, pass you like freight

04:33.480 --> 04:39.720
trains. But most look like oily jellyfish the size of a car, sporting long tentacles that act

04:39.720 --> 04:46.080
like supercharged propellers. Despite the water holding onto them like glue, some move hundreds

04:46.080 --> 04:52.080
of body lengths per second, equivalent to a person shoveling through mud at over 600 kilometers an

04:52.080 --> 04:58.760
hour. However, bacteria weigh so little and water is so viscous that they basically have no inertia.

04:58.760 --> 05:05.040
There is no gliding on this scale. The result is a weird jerky motion that's hard to keep track of.

05:05.040 --> 05:12.840
Maybe we can learn more about this strange motion if we go even deeper. The molecule realm. You've

05:12.880 --> 05:18.580
become the size of a molecule, just under two nanometers wide. At your new tiny scale,

05:18.580 --> 05:24.240
the droplet now seems as big as the moon to a regular human. The blade of grass it rests on

05:24.240 --> 05:29.280
could reach from the tip of Alaska to the end of Australia. And the park is now almost the size

05:29.280 --> 05:36.400
of the solar system. But instead of mostly empty space, it is filled with stuff. Everywhere you

05:36.400 --> 05:41.480
look, there are innumerable amounts of molecules and atoms. The rigid walls of the grass cells

05:41.600 --> 05:47.720
beneath you are clearly vibrating, rippling with waves of energy. The water droplet contains nearly

05:47.720 --> 05:53.720
a sextillion water molecules that are all in motion. Water is actually a storm of H2O molecules

05:53.720 --> 05:58.920
smashing into each other hundreds of trillions of times a second. Each of them is moving at speeds

05:58.920 --> 06:04.760
of around 2,300 kilometers an hour and bombard their surroundings mercilessly, sending small

06:04.760 --> 06:10.400
objects hurtling in all directions. This is the source of the invisible current that you noticed

06:10.400 --> 06:16.280
when you were 1000 times larger. scaling the speed up to the human scale is impossible as a

06:16.280 --> 06:22.960
human sized molecule would be 2000 times faster than the speed of light. All this furious motion

06:22.960 --> 06:28.360
comes from heat. Heat is a bit abstract at our human scale, where you touch something and get

06:28.360 --> 06:35.080
a vague sense of whether it's hot or cold. But down here, you really feel what heat is the motion

06:35.080 --> 06:42.360
of molecules vibrating, twisting and colliding as if they're inside a furious ball pit. When

06:42.360 --> 06:48.120
these molecules lose heat, they move more slowly and collide less often. When they gain heat,

06:48.120 --> 06:53.080
they speed up and smash together with renewed further temperature is basically the measure of

06:53.080 --> 06:59.040
the average speed of these fantastic dancers performing all day. Suddenly, a molecule hits

06:59.040 --> 07:04.840
you especially hard, and you're catapulted out of the water droplet into the air again. And here,

07:05.080 --> 07:13.400
you see something unexpected. The stuff between the air molecules, nothing between the molecules

07:13.400 --> 07:18.480
that make up the air, there is a vacuum. On average, a molecule in the air travels for

07:18.480 --> 07:23.960
about 60 nanometers, which is about the length of a hockey rink if it were the size of a human. If

07:23.960 --> 07:27.960
we were to compress all the molecules and atoms buzzing around in the room you're watching this

07:27.960 --> 07:35.560
in, they would only film about 0.1% of its volume. 99.9% of the space around you is a vacuum,

07:35.560 --> 07:40.380
you just don't notice it. Which also means that every time you take a breath, you breathe in

07:40.380 --> 07:47.960
mostly nothing with a few atoms. The subatomic realm. At your size of under two picometers,

07:47.960 --> 07:53.760
scale starts to lose its meaning. A human would be nearly 2 billion kilometers tall relative to

07:53.760 --> 07:59.600
you, so large they could stretch their arms from the sun to Saturn. An atomic nucleus would be the

07:59.600 --> 08:06.000
size of a grain of sand you could hold on the tip of your finger. That grain holds 99.97% of

08:06.000 --> 08:11.600
the atoms mass. The rest, a sphere of influence about as large as the Eiffel Tower from your

08:11.600 --> 08:16.720
perspective, is filled with an electron cloud. That's basically all the places where electrons

08:16.720 --> 08:22.400
might be at any given moment in time. Electrons are shape shifters that morph around outside a

08:22.400 --> 08:28.640
nucleus, creating a new and vibrating mess of different shapes with every new moment. Unlike

08:28.640 --> 08:35.520
the graceful motion of planets, the atomic nuclei are chaotic blurs. They bulge, roll, quiver, and

08:35.520 --> 08:41.160
breathe. They hold back the same energy that powers nuclear bombs, and it doesn't let them sit

08:41.160 --> 08:49.360
still. They twist and vibrate six-dillions of times a second. It's time to end our journey and return

08:49.360 --> 08:59.560
to... What you doing? Stop it! The smallest place. We have reached the bottom, the border between

08:59.560 --> 09:06.320
reality and unreality. The scale here is the Planck length, which is the distance light travels in a

09:06.320 --> 09:12.880
Planck time. Planck time is the time it takes light to travel a Planck length. Hmm, okay. None

09:12.880 --> 09:19.280
of our models of the universe make sense at scales smaller than this, so for now, this is it. We

09:19.280 --> 09:24.320
think that down here, particles bubble into existence and then spontaneously disappear,

09:24.320 --> 09:31.640
creating a quantum foam of unimaginable energy. Can we go even smaller? We don't know. It's time

09:31.640 --> 09:55.760
to return. If you look up, the universe is large and strange, so incredibly large and strange. But

09:55.760 --> 10:02.640
if you look down into the tiny and extremely tiny, the universe seems even larger and even

10:02.640 --> 10:09.520
stranger. In the end, the perfect place might be where you are right now. Not too big, not too

10:09.520 --> 10:35.800
small. I'm ready. We did it. It worked. Right under our noses, there's so much hidden that we

10:35.800 --> 10:42.040
never get to see with our own eyes. Entire realms of bizarre structures and outlandish creatures.

10:42.040 --> 10:48.880
What a magical place this is. A forest of slime molds, single-celled organisms that work together

10:48.880 --> 10:53.960
and form fungus-like structures. But we don't have time to hang out with these calm fellows any

10:53.960 --> 11:00.640
longer. Shh, now we're in the kingdom of the mighty tardigrades. Don't disturb them in their

11:00.680 --> 11:05.800
death-like slumber. Don't worry though, they'll wake up once the conditions are less rough. Oh,

11:05.800 --> 11:13.240
didn't mean to get in the way. Your cells are hustling to keep you alive, coordinating myriads

11:13.240 --> 11:19.480
of proteins. This might be the weirdest place yet, with no up or down. There's way too much going on,

11:19.480 --> 11:27.320
better move on. Now we're inside one of the parts that allow you to watch this video. The structure

11:27.320 --> 11:34.040
of a microchip is so small, it nearly breaks the rules of the quantum realm. Wait, something's

11:34.040 --> 11:44.160
happening. These hidden worlds are all part of our 12,023 human-era calendar. This time, you can join

11:44.160 --> 11:50.160
us on a journey through the microcosm. With each turn of the page, you will reveal a new world you

11:50.160 --> 11:56.720
didn't know existed right beneath your feet. You know the drill by now. As always, it's a super

11:56.760 --> 12:02.540
high-quality calendar, very shiny, and only available for a short time. We also have a

12:02.540 --> 12:07.600
few special deals for you in our shop. The calendar is a true piece of Kurzgesagt you can

12:07.600 --> 12:13.180
take home with you. And we say this every year, but it's true, every calendar purchase directly

12:13.180 --> 12:19.280
supports what we do here at Kurzgesagt. And that's not just creating videos, but sparking curiosity

12:19.280 --> 12:24.960
all around the world. So because of you, we can spread knowledge and ignite an appreciation for

12:24.960 --> 12:30.120
space, nature, and life in people everywhere. Thank you so much for making this possible.

12:30.120 --> 12:35.400
Have a wonderful 12,023. See you down in January.
