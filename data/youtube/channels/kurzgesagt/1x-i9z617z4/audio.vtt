00:00.000 --> 00:06.960
In 2023, Kurzgesagt has existed for 10 years, insanely long in internet years.

00:06.960 --> 00:10.560
We're among the largest science-y channels on YouTube and still a bit of a black box

00:10.560 --> 00:11.560
to people.

00:11.560 --> 00:16.920
So let's talk about ourselves a bit in three parts â€“ our backstory, how we finance our

00:16.920 --> 00:20.040
work and the values of Kurzgesagt.

00:20.040 --> 00:23.260
Let's jump back to a more innocent time.

00:23.260 --> 00:29.320
From humble beginnings to today, Kurzgesagt's foundation was laid when Philipp, our founder,

00:29.320 --> 00:32.080
dropped out of high school as a teenager.

00:32.080 --> 00:36.440
Learning seemed daft and useless, and he wasn't interested in anything.

00:36.440 --> 00:41.680
Until a very special teacher at a school for dropouts grabbed him by the neck.

00:41.680 --> 00:43.880
The way she taught was different.

00:43.880 --> 00:46.620
She talked about connections and the big picture.

00:46.620 --> 00:47.620
She told a story.

00:47.620 --> 00:52.040
For the first time ever, Philipp wanted to learn more without being forced.

00:52.040 --> 00:54.200
It was a key life experience.

00:54.200 --> 00:58.000
Kurzgesagt tries to recreate this experience for you.

00:58.200 --> 01:02.300
Nothing is boring if you tell a good story, and we try to tell these stories to spark

01:02.300 --> 01:05.960
excitement and make you want to go on and learn more.

01:05.960 --> 01:09.580
Because of the one teacher that could do this, Philipp got a high school degree, studied

01:09.580 --> 01:14.280
history and design, and eventually started Kurzgesagt as a passion project inspired by

01:14.280 --> 01:16.120
Crash Course World History.

01:16.120 --> 01:20.720
In 2012, YouTube was less commercial and more idealistic.

01:20.720 --> 01:24.920
You couldn't make a living with videos as involved as ours, and that was fine.

01:24.920 --> 01:29.120
The goal was creative freedom, and so for the first few years, it actually cost money

01:29.120 --> 01:30.760
to make Kurzgesagt.

01:30.760 --> 01:35.940
We had no outside funding, just intrinsic motivation and a few friends from university.

01:35.940 --> 01:41.760
We worked for clients during the day and on Kurzgesagt at night, 80 to 100 hours a week.

01:41.760 --> 01:45.680
It was a real struggle, but also very rewarding.

01:45.680 --> 01:51.040
But then Patreon launched, sponsorship started, our views increased, YouTube changed.

01:51.200 --> 01:56.160
In 2015, the channel began to break even, and then to earn a profit.

01:56.160 --> 02:00.320
But we were pretty burned out at this point, so we decided to bring in more friends and

02:00.320 --> 02:04.760
hire the first team members full time, creating a legal entity.

02:04.760 --> 02:09.380
More people meant that we could stop overworking, do more, and improve.

02:09.380 --> 02:11.440
But we also needed to earn more.

02:11.440 --> 02:14.440
The livelihood of real humans depended upon it.

02:14.440 --> 02:17.140
None of us had any experience in running a company.

02:17.140 --> 02:21.240
We didn't plan to become big or to grow, it sort of just happened.

02:21.240 --> 02:25.860
A decade later, Kurzgesagt is not a small project anymore.

02:25.860 --> 02:29.940
We are an animation studio with offices in Munich and Berlin.

02:29.940 --> 02:36.660
We need computers, monitors, tablets, desks, coffee, contracts, pay licenses, taxes, rent

02:36.660 --> 02:38.740
and insurance.

02:38.740 --> 02:46.000
In 2023, our team consists of over 60 employees and a lot of freelancers around the world.

02:46.000 --> 02:50.820
Banners alone cost millions of dollars a year just to stay around.

02:50.820 --> 02:53.160
This creates an interesting problem.

02:53.160 --> 02:58.700
With such high production costs, how can we publish our work for free?

02:58.700 --> 03:01.220
How we finance Kurzgesagt.

03:01.220 --> 03:05.520
We have added up our earnings from 2015 through 2022.

03:05.520 --> 03:09.760
Our sources of funding change depending on opportunities and the state of the world.

03:09.760 --> 03:13.240
Early on, agency work was our main source of income.

03:13.240 --> 03:14.840
Ad revenue varies.

03:14.840 --> 03:17.800
In some years we got more sponsorships than in others.

03:17.800 --> 03:21.840
The shop didn't exist for a long time, then it became pretty big after we launched our

03:21.840 --> 03:22.840
calendar.

03:22.840 --> 03:28.200
62% of our revenue comes indirectly or directly from you.

03:28.200 --> 03:33.500
You watch our videos with ads, support us on Patreon, or buy from our shop.

03:33.500 --> 03:39.320
The single biggest source of income by far is our shop that alone accounted for 40% over

03:39.320 --> 03:40.940
the last 8 years.

03:40.940 --> 03:45.860
The shop started small, but once we published our calendar for the first time in 2016, we

03:45.860 --> 03:50.300
realized it could really help us do more things and we started producing more and more science

03:50.300 --> 03:55.700
products from our posters to our gratitude journal or universe-centered candles.

03:55.700 --> 04:00.300
YouTube ads accounted for 13% and Patreon 9%.

04:00.300 --> 04:04.320
So without your support, we would cease to exist.

04:04.320 --> 04:09.200
Our shop and Patreon are our most important sources of revenue and because we see ourselves

04:09.200 --> 04:13.960
as science communicators, we don't just do merch, but sciency products that we spend

04:13.960 --> 04:18.240
hundreds of hours researching, discussing with experts, polishing up and working on

04:18.240 --> 04:20.820
directly with the manufacturers.

04:20.820 --> 04:24.200
They are part of the science story we try to tell.

04:24.200 --> 04:28.820
It also just feels good to get directly funded by you guys and give you something back for

04:28.820 --> 04:30.960
it on top of our videos.

04:30.960 --> 04:36.600
YouTube ads are a crucial part of our funding as well, but they are not within our control.

04:36.600 --> 04:40.760
Then there's paid agency work, which we stopped doing in 2022.

04:40.760 --> 04:44.600
It accounted for 9% of our revenue over the last 8 years.

04:44.600 --> 04:48.280
A lot in the beginning, not much by the end.

04:48.280 --> 04:51.440
Then there are commercial sponsors advertising products.

04:51.440 --> 04:54.240
They accounted for 12% of our revenue.

04:54.240 --> 04:59.400
We also got about 7% from German public broadcasting for the German channel, but ended this partnership

04:59.400 --> 05:00.920
in 2022.

05:00.920 --> 05:05.840
Finally, there are institutional sponsors representing about 10%.

05:05.840 --> 05:09.880
Some people take issue with this, especially Bill Gates has come under public scrutiny

05:09.880 --> 05:14.280
and we've been criticized for even working with organizations funded by him.

05:14.280 --> 05:17.500
So let's look at this 10% in more detail.

05:17.500 --> 05:22.260
About 3% of our revenue over the last 8 years came from the Gates organizations for a wide

05:22.260 --> 05:25.560
variety of topics often suggested by us.

05:25.560 --> 05:31.000
5% comes from open philanthropy and is only used for specific projects.

05:31.000 --> 05:36.160
With these funds, we've started Arabic, Hindi, Korean, Japanese, Portuguese, and French

05:36.160 --> 05:40.560
channels bringing more free science content to more people.

05:40.560 --> 05:44.360
Then there's a 2-year funding for original TikTok content, which gives us freedom to

05:44.360 --> 05:48.500
explore and learn how to do short form science communication.

05:48.500 --> 05:54.780
The final 2% came from other organizations like the Red Cross or the UN for example.

05:54.780 --> 05:59.560
We choose institutional sponsors carefully, but if organizations want to fund videos that

05:59.560 --> 06:04.200
help us spread quality information about relevant topics, this is an easy yes for us

06:04.200 --> 06:06.600
if we have the capacity for it.

06:06.600 --> 06:11.720
On top of that, the institutional sponsors we're working with align with our values.

06:11.720 --> 06:16.960
We have contracts with every grant giver or sponsor that bars them from editorial influence

06:16.960 --> 06:21.640
other than suggesting topic areas like global health or climate change.

06:21.640 --> 06:27.740
We agree on video topics together, but sponsors can neither influence details nor our conclusions.

06:27.740 --> 06:30.940
The final decision always remains with us.

06:30.940 --> 06:34.860
And usually we develop the topics of the videos autonomously and tell the sponsor what we're

06:34.860 --> 06:36.420
doing afterwards.

06:36.420 --> 06:40.540
If you're interested in how we research our videos in detail, our head of research wrote

06:40.540 --> 06:42.580
an article about it.

06:42.580 --> 06:47.740
Running an educational YouTube channel is a balancing act that we take very seriously.

06:47.740 --> 06:52.380
We're doing our best to maintain this balance, adjusting whenever necessary.

06:52.380 --> 06:56.980
As a team and a company, we want to grow to give more people access to a science-based

06:56.980 --> 06:59.220
outlook on the world.

06:59.220 --> 07:01.460
This brings us to our final topic.

07:01.460 --> 07:04.100
Why are we doing kurzgesagt?

07:04.100 --> 07:07.260
Our values and our vision.

07:07.260 --> 07:10.300
Our core mission is to spark curiosity.

07:10.300 --> 07:14.960
We want to make science and humanism accessible for as many people as possible.

07:14.960 --> 07:19.480
The effort we put into creating our videos is a way of achieving that.

07:19.480 --> 07:24.420
Our videos are beautiful because that helps to spark curiosity, to understand complex

07:24.420 --> 07:28.540
topics and because it just feels good to create and watch.

07:28.540 --> 07:33.780
Our research is as intensive as it is, so our videos are a good simplification of very

07:33.780 --> 07:35.820
complicated topics.

07:35.820 --> 07:40.340
We want to make people excited about science so they rediscover subjects they hated in

07:40.340 --> 07:43.780
school and see how amazing they are.

07:43.780 --> 07:50.300
On top of curiosity, we want to inspire long-term thinking and a positive, constructive outlook.

07:50.300 --> 07:56.520
Being optimistic about the future of humanity is not mainstream, and we think this is horrible.

07:56.520 --> 08:01.800
Pessimism often sounds smart and gets more views, while optimism can sound naive.

08:01.800 --> 08:05.420
But this is a bias that's not helpful for us as a species.

08:05.420 --> 08:09.760
So despite the gloominess of many topics, we want to approach them with informed and

08:09.760 --> 08:11.980
well-researched optimism.

08:11.980 --> 08:16.420
Not brushing humanity's very real challenges aside, but also not falling into the trap

08:16.420 --> 08:17.980
of pessimism.

08:17.980 --> 08:22.180
We want to inspire you to dream a little about the glorious future that we could actually

08:22.180 --> 08:25.940
build, but only if we believe it's possible.

08:25.940 --> 08:29.440
In the long run, we don't only want to do this on YouTube.

08:29.440 --> 08:34.180
The idea is for Kurzgesagt to be a positive influence across more media.

08:34.180 --> 08:39.180
On our TikTok channel, in the long-form content we're exploring, in apps, in the VR game

08:39.180 --> 08:43.580
that will be released later this year, and the games we plan to make in the future.

08:43.580 --> 08:46.340
Our shop is a central part of this vision.

08:46.340 --> 08:50.620
We start our stories with a video and end them with a poster.

08:50.620 --> 08:52.940
There are so many things we want to do.

08:52.940 --> 08:57.260
And thanks to you watching this right now, we have the freedom to work to the best of

08:57.260 --> 08:59.040
our knowledge and ability.

08:59.040 --> 09:03.220
In the end, we hope you like what we offer and that we'll be doing something worthwhile

09:03.220 --> 09:05.600
for as long as we exist.

09:05.600 --> 09:10.920
And hopefully, we'll have a lasting impact by making science and learning more fun for

09:10.920 --> 09:13.260
as many people as possible.

09:13.260 --> 09:17.280
If you personally want to help us do this, you can watch and share our videos, check

09:17.280 --> 09:21.700
out our shop, become a Patreon, or give us an Adblocker exception.

09:21.700 --> 09:27.260
We exist because of you, and you have no idea how much we appreciate that you're here.

09:27.260 --> 09:30.440
And hopefully, we're less of a black box now.

09:30.440 --> 09:35.760
In any case, doing Kurzgesagt for a decade has been a pretty crazy ride.

09:35.760 --> 09:41.180
And so, from the whole team, thank you so much for being with us all these years.

09:43.260 --> 09:45.400
Thank you.
