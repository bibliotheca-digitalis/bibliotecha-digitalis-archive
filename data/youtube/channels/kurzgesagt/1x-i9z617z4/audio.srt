00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,960
In 2023, Kurzgesagt has existed for 10 years, insanely long in internet years.

2
00:00:06,960 --> 00:00:10,560
We're among the largest science-y channels on YouTube and still a bit of a black box

3
00:00:10,560 --> 00:00:11,560
to people.

4
00:00:11,560 --> 00:00:16,920
So let's talk about ourselves a bit in three parts â€“ our backstory, how we finance our

5
00:00:16,920 --> 00:00:20,040
work and the values of Kurzgesagt.

6
00:00:20,040 --> 00:00:23,260
Let's jump back to a more innocent time.

7
00:00:23,260 --> 00:00:29,320
From humble beginnings to today, Kurzgesagt's foundation was laid when Philipp, our founder,

8
00:00:29,320 --> 00:00:32,080
dropped out of high school as a teenager.

9
00:00:32,080 --> 00:00:36,440
Learning seemed daft and useless, and he wasn't interested in anything.

10
00:00:36,440 --> 00:00:41,680
Until a very special teacher at a school for dropouts grabbed him by the neck.

11
00:00:41,680 --> 00:00:43,880
The way she taught was different.

12
00:00:43,880 --> 00:00:46,620
She talked about connections and the big picture.

13
00:00:46,620 --> 00:00:47,620
She told a story.

14
00:00:47,620 --> 00:00:52,040
For the first time ever, Philipp wanted to learn more without being forced.

15
00:00:52,040 --> 00:00:54,200
It was a key life experience.

16
00:00:54,200 --> 00:00:58,000
Kurzgesagt tries to recreate this experience for you.

17
00:00:58,200 --> 00:01:02,300
Nothing is boring if you tell a good story, and we try to tell these stories to spark

18
00:01:02,300 --> 00:01:05,960
excitement and make you want to go on and learn more.

19
00:01:05,960 --> 00:01:09,580
Because of the one teacher that could do this, Philipp got a high school degree, studied

20
00:01:09,580 --> 00:01:14,280
history and design, and eventually started Kurzgesagt as a passion project inspired by

21
00:01:14,280 --> 00:01:16,120
Crash Course World History.

22
00:01:16,120 --> 00:01:20,720
In 2012, YouTube was less commercial and more idealistic.

23
00:01:20,720 --> 00:01:24,920
You couldn't make a living with videos as involved as ours, and that was fine.

24
00:01:24,920 --> 00:01:29,120
The goal was creative freedom, and so for the first few years, it actually cost money

25
00:01:29,120 --> 00:01:30,760
to make Kurzgesagt.

26
00:01:30,760 --> 00:01:35,940
We had no outside funding, just intrinsic motivation and a few friends from university.

27
00:01:35,940 --> 00:01:41,760
We worked for clients during the day and on Kurzgesagt at night, 80 to 100 hours a week.

28
00:01:41,760 --> 00:01:45,680
It was a real struggle, but also very rewarding.

29
00:01:45,680 --> 00:01:51,040
But then Patreon launched, sponsorship started, our views increased, YouTube changed.

30
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:56,160
In 2015, the channel began to break even, and then to earn a profit.

31
00:01:56,160 --> 00:02:00,320
But we were pretty burned out at this point, so we decided to bring in more friends and

32
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:04,760
hire the first team members full time, creating a legal entity.

33
00:02:04,760 --> 00:02:09,380
More people meant that we could stop overworking, do more, and improve.

34
00:02:09,380 --> 00:02:11,440
But we also needed to earn more.

35
00:02:11,440 --> 00:02:14,440
The livelihood of real humans depended upon it.

36
00:02:14,440 --> 00:02:17,140
None of us had any experience in running a company.

37
00:02:17,140 --> 00:02:21,240
We didn't plan to become big or to grow, it sort of just happened.

38
00:02:21,240 --> 00:02:25,860
A decade later, Kurzgesagt is not a small project anymore.

39
00:02:25,860 --> 00:02:29,940
We are an animation studio with offices in Munich and Berlin.

40
00:02:29,940 --> 00:02:36,660
We need computers, monitors, tablets, desks, coffee, contracts, pay licenses, taxes, rent

41
00:02:36,660 --> 00:02:38,740
and insurance.

42
00:02:38,740 --> 00:02:46,000
In 2023, our team consists of over 60 employees and a lot of freelancers around the world.

43
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:50,820
Banners alone cost millions of dollars a year just to stay around.

44
00:02:50,820 --> 00:02:53,160
This creates an interesting problem.

45
00:02:53,160 --> 00:02:58,700
With such high production costs, how can we publish our work for free?

46
00:02:58,700 --> 00:03:01,220
How we finance Kurzgesagt.

47
00:03:01,220 --> 00:03:05,520
We have added up our earnings from 2015 through 2022.

48
00:03:05,520 --> 00:03:09,760
Our sources of funding change depending on opportunities and the state of the world.

49
00:03:09,760 --> 00:03:13,240
Early on, agency work was our main source of income.

50
00:03:13,240 --> 00:03:14,840
Ad revenue varies.

51
00:03:14,840 --> 00:03:17,800
In some years we got more sponsorships than in others.

52
00:03:17,800 --> 00:03:21,840
The shop didn't exist for a long time, then it became pretty big after we launched our

53
00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:22,840
calendar.

54
00:03:22,840 --> 00:03:28,200
62% of our revenue comes indirectly or directly from you.

55
00:03:28,200 --> 00:03:33,500
You watch our videos with ads, support us on Patreon, or buy from our shop.

56
00:03:33,500 --> 00:03:39,320
The single biggest source of income by far is our shop that alone accounted for 40% over

57
00:03:39,320 --> 00:03:40,940
the last 8 years.

58
00:03:40,940 --> 00:03:45,860
The shop started small, but once we published our calendar for the first time in 2016, we

59
00:03:45,860 --> 00:03:50,300
realized it could really help us do more things and we started producing more and more science

60
00:03:50,300 --> 00:03:55,700
products from our posters to our gratitude journal or universe-centered candles.

61
00:03:55,700 --> 00:04:00,300
YouTube ads accounted for 13% and Patreon 9%.

62
00:04:00,300 --> 00:04:04,320
So without your support, we would cease to exist.

63
00:04:04,320 --> 00:04:09,200
Our shop and Patreon are our most important sources of revenue and because we see ourselves

64
00:04:09,200 --> 00:04:13,960
as science communicators, we don't just do merch, but sciency products that we spend

65
00:04:13,960 --> 00:04:18,240
hundreds of hours researching, discussing with experts, polishing up and working on

66
00:04:18,240 --> 00:04:20,820
directly with the manufacturers.

67
00:04:20,820 --> 00:04:24,200
They are part of the science story we try to tell.

68
00:04:24,200 --> 00:04:28,820
It also just feels good to get directly funded by you guys and give you something back for

69
00:04:28,820 --> 00:04:30,960
it on top of our videos.

70
00:04:30,960 --> 00:04:36,600
YouTube ads are a crucial part of our funding as well, but they are not within our control.

71
00:04:36,600 --> 00:04:40,760
Then there's paid agency work, which we stopped doing in 2022.

72
00:04:40,760 --> 00:04:44,600
It accounted for 9% of our revenue over the last 8 years.

73
00:04:44,600 --> 00:04:48,280
A lot in the beginning, not much by the end.

74
00:04:48,280 --> 00:04:51,440
Then there are commercial sponsors advertising products.

75
00:04:51,440 --> 00:04:54,240
They accounted for 12% of our revenue.

76
00:04:54,240 --> 00:04:59,400
We also got about 7% from German public broadcasting for the German channel, but ended this partnership

77
00:04:59,400 --> 00:05:00,920
in 2022.

78
00:05:00,920 --> 00:05:05,840
Finally, there are institutional sponsors representing about 10%.

79
00:05:05,840 --> 00:05:09,880
Some people take issue with this, especially Bill Gates has come under public scrutiny

80
00:05:09,880 --> 00:05:14,280
and we've been criticized for even working with organizations funded by him.

81
00:05:14,280 --> 00:05:17,500
So let's look at this 10% in more detail.

82
00:05:17,500 --> 00:05:22,260
About 3% of our revenue over the last 8 years came from the Gates organizations for a wide

83
00:05:22,260 --> 00:05:25,560
variety of topics often suggested by us.

84
00:05:25,560 --> 00:05:31,000
5% comes from open philanthropy and is only used for specific projects.

85
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:36,160
With these funds, we've started Arabic, Hindi, Korean, Japanese, Portuguese, and French

86
00:05:36,160 --> 00:05:40,560
channels bringing more free science content to more people.

87
00:05:40,560 --> 00:05:44,360
Then there's a 2-year funding for original TikTok content, which gives us freedom to

88
00:05:44,360 --> 00:05:48,500
explore and learn how to do short form science communication.

89
00:05:48,500 --> 00:05:54,780
The final 2% came from other organizations like the Red Cross or the UN for example.

90
00:05:54,780 --> 00:05:59,560
We choose institutional sponsors carefully, but if organizations want to fund videos that

91
00:05:59,560 --> 00:06:04,200
help us spread quality information about relevant topics, this is an easy yes for us

92
00:06:04,200 --> 00:06:06,600
if we have the capacity for it.

93
00:06:06,600 --> 00:06:11,720
On top of that, the institutional sponsors we're working with align with our values.

94
00:06:11,720 --> 00:06:16,960
We have contracts with every grant giver or sponsor that bars them from editorial influence

95
00:06:16,960 --> 00:06:21,640
other than suggesting topic areas like global health or climate change.

96
00:06:21,640 --> 00:06:27,740
We agree on video topics together, but sponsors can neither influence details nor our conclusions.

97
00:06:27,740 --> 00:06:30,940
The final decision always remains with us.

98
00:06:30,940 --> 00:06:34,860
And usually we develop the topics of the videos autonomously and tell the sponsor what we're

99
00:06:34,860 --> 00:06:36,420
doing afterwards.

100
00:06:36,420 --> 00:06:40,540
If you're interested in how we research our videos in detail, our head of research wrote

101
00:06:40,540 --> 00:06:42,580
an article about it.

102
00:06:42,580 --> 00:06:47,740
Running an educational YouTube channel is a balancing act that we take very seriously.

103
00:06:47,740 --> 00:06:52,380
We're doing our best to maintain this balance, adjusting whenever necessary.

104
00:06:52,380 --> 00:06:56,980
As a team and a company, we want to grow to give more people access to a science-based

105
00:06:56,980 --> 00:06:59,220
outlook on the world.

106
00:06:59,220 --> 00:07:01,460
This brings us to our final topic.

107
00:07:01,460 --> 00:07:04,100
Why are we doing kurzgesagt?

108
00:07:04,100 --> 00:07:07,260
Our values and our vision.

109
00:07:07,260 --> 00:07:10,300
Our core mission is to spark curiosity.

110
00:07:10,300 --> 00:07:14,960
We want to make science and humanism accessible for as many people as possible.

111
00:07:14,960 --> 00:07:19,480
The effort we put into creating our videos is a way of achieving that.

112
00:07:19,480 --> 00:07:24,420
Our videos are beautiful because that helps to spark curiosity, to understand complex

113
00:07:24,420 --> 00:07:28,540
topics and because it just feels good to create and watch.

114
00:07:28,540 --> 00:07:33,780
Our research is as intensive as it is, so our videos are a good simplification of very

115
00:07:33,780 --> 00:07:35,820
complicated topics.

116
00:07:35,820 --> 00:07:40,340
We want to make people excited about science so they rediscover subjects they hated in

117
00:07:40,340 --> 00:07:43,780
school and see how amazing they are.

118
00:07:43,780 --> 00:07:50,300
On top of curiosity, we want to inspire long-term thinking and a positive, constructive outlook.

119
00:07:50,300 --> 00:07:56,520
Being optimistic about the future of humanity is not mainstream, and we think this is horrible.

120
00:07:56,520 --> 00:08:01,800
Pessimism often sounds smart and gets more views, while optimism can sound naive.

121
00:08:01,800 --> 00:08:05,420
But this is a bias that's not helpful for us as a species.

122
00:08:05,420 --> 00:08:09,760
So despite the gloominess of many topics, we want to approach them with informed and

123
00:08:09,760 --> 00:08:11,980
well-researched optimism.

124
00:08:11,980 --> 00:08:16,420
Not brushing humanity's very real challenges aside, but also not falling into the trap

125
00:08:16,420 --> 00:08:17,980
of pessimism.

126
00:08:17,980 --> 00:08:22,180
We want to inspire you to dream a little about the glorious future that we could actually

127
00:08:22,180 --> 00:08:25,940
build, but only if we believe it's possible.

128
00:08:25,940 --> 00:08:29,440
In the long run, we don't only want to do this on YouTube.

129
00:08:29,440 --> 00:08:34,180
The idea is for Kurzgesagt to be a positive influence across more media.

130
00:08:34,180 --> 00:08:39,180
On our TikTok channel, in the long-form content we're exploring, in apps, in the VR game

131
00:08:39,180 --> 00:08:43,580
that will be released later this year, and the games we plan to make in the future.

132
00:08:43,580 --> 00:08:46,340
Our shop is a central part of this vision.

133
00:08:46,340 --> 00:08:50,620
We start our stories with a video and end them with a poster.

134
00:08:50,620 --> 00:08:52,940
There are so many things we want to do.

135
00:08:52,940 --> 00:08:57,260
And thanks to you watching this right now, we have the freedom to work to the best of

136
00:08:57,260 --> 00:08:59,040
our knowledge and ability.

137
00:08:59,040 --> 00:09:03,220
In the end, we hope you like what we offer and that we'll be doing something worthwhile

138
00:09:03,220 --> 00:09:05,600
for as long as we exist.

139
00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:10,920
And hopefully, we'll have a lasting impact by making science and learning more fun for

140
00:09:10,920 --> 00:09:13,260
as many people as possible.

141
00:09:13,260 --> 00:09:17,280
If you personally want to help us do this, you can watch and share our videos, check

142
00:09:17,280 --> 00:09:21,700
out our shop, become a Patreon, or give us an Adblocker exception.

143
00:09:21,700 --> 00:09:27,260
We exist because of you, and you have no idea how much we appreciate that you're here.

144
00:09:27,260 --> 00:09:30,440
And hopefully, we're less of a black box now.

145
00:09:30,440 --> 00:09:35,760
In any case, doing Kurzgesagt for a decade has been a pretty crazy ride.

146
00:09:35,760 --> 00:09:41,180
And so, from the whole team, thank you so much for being with us all these years.

147
00:09:43,260 --> 00:09:45,400
Thank you.
