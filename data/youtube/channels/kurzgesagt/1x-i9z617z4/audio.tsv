0	6960	In 2023, Kurzgesagt has existed for 10 years, insanely long in internet years.
6960	10560	We're among the largest science-y channels on YouTube and still a bit of a black box
10560	11560	to people.
11560	16920	So let's talk about ourselves a bit in three parts â€“ our backstory, how we finance our
16920	20040	work and the values of Kurzgesagt.
20040	23260	Let's jump back to a more innocent time.
23260	29320	From humble beginnings to today, Kurzgesagt's foundation was laid when Philipp, our founder,
29320	32080	dropped out of high school as a teenager.
32080	36440	Learning seemed daft and useless, and he wasn't interested in anything.
36440	41680	Until a very special teacher at a school for dropouts grabbed him by the neck.
41680	43880	The way she taught was different.
43880	46620	She talked about connections and the big picture.
46620	47620	She told a story.
47620	52040	For the first time ever, Philipp wanted to learn more without being forced.
52040	54200	It was a key life experience.
54200	58000	Kurzgesagt tries to recreate this experience for you.
58200	62300	Nothing is boring if you tell a good story, and we try to tell these stories to spark
62300	65960	excitement and make you want to go on and learn more.
65960	69580	Because of the one teacher that could do this, Philipp got a high school degree, studied
69580	74280	history and design, and eventually started Kurzgesagt as a passion project inspired by
74280	76120	Crash Course World History.
76120	80720	In 2012, YouTube was less commercial and more idealistic.
80720	84920	You couldn't make a living with videos as involved as ours, and that was fine.
84920	89120	The goal was creative freedom, and so for the first few years, it actually cost money
89120	90760	to make Kurzgesagt.
90760	95940	We had no outside funding, just intrinsic motivation and a few friends from university.
95940	101760	We worked for clients during the day and on Kurzgesagt at night, 80 to 100 hours a week.
101760	105680	It was a real struggle, but also very rewarding.
105680	111040	But then Patreon launched, sponsorship started, our views increased, YouTube changed.
111200	116160	In 2015, the channel began to break even, and then to earn a profit.
116160	120320	But we were pretty burned out at this point, so we decided to bring in more friends and
120320	124760	hire the first team members full time, creating a legal entity.
124760	129380	More people meant that we could stop overworking, do more, and improve.
129380	131440	But we also needed to earn more.
131440	134440	The livelihood of real humans depended upon it.
134440	137140	None of us had any experience in running a company.
137140	141240	We didn't plan to become big or to grow, it sort of just happened.
141240	145860	A decade later, Kurzgesagt is not a small project anymore.
145860	149940	We are an animation studio with offices in Munich and Berlin.
149940	156660	We need computers, monitors, tablets, desks, coffee, contracts, pay licenses, taxes, rent
156660	158740	and insurance.
158740	166000	In 2023, our team consists of over 60 employees and a lot of freelancers around the world.
166000	170820	Banners alone cost millions of dollars a year just to stay around.
170820	173160	This creates an interesting problem.
173160	178700	With such high production costs, how can we publish our work for free?
178700	181220	How we finance Kurzgesagt.
181220	185520	We have added up our earnings from 2015 through 2022.
185520	189760	Our sources of funding change depending on opportunities and the state of the world.
189760	193240	Early on, agency work was our main source of income.
193240	194840	Ad revenue varies.
194840	197800	In some years we got more sponsorships than in others.
197800	201840	The shop didn't exist for a long time, then it became pretty big after we launched our
201840	202840	calendar.
202840	208200	62% of our revenue comes indirectly or directly from you.
208200	213500	You watch our videos with ads, support us on Patreon, or buy from our shop.
213500	219320	The single biggest source of income by far is our shop that alone accounted for 40% over
219320	220940	the last 8 years.
220940	225860	The shop started small, but once we published our calendar for the first time in 2016, we
225860	230300	realized it could really help us do more things and we started producing more and more science
230300	235700	products from our posters to our gratitude journal or universe-centered candles.
235700	240300	YouTube ads accounted for 13% and Patreon 9%.
240300	244320	So without your support, we would cease to exist.
244320	249200	Our shop and Patreon are our most important sources of revenue and because we see ourselves
249200	253960	as science communicators, we don't just do merch, but sciency products that we spend
253960	258240	hundreds of hours researching, discussing with experts, polishing up and working on
258240	260820	directly with the manufacturers.
260820	264200	They are part of the science story we try to tell.
264200	268820	It also just feels good to get directly funded by you guys and give you something back for
268820	270960	it on top of our videos.
270960	276600	YouTube ads are a crucial part of our funding as well, but they are not within our control.
276600	280760	Then there's paid agency work, which we stopped doing in 2022.
280760	284600	It accounted for 9% of our revenue over the last 8 years.
284600	288280	A lot in the beginning, not much by the end.
288280	291440	Then there are commercial sponsors advertising products.
291440	294240	They accounted for 12% of our revenue.
294240	299400	We also got about 7% from German public broadcasting for the German channel, but ended this partnership
299400	300920	in 2022.
300920	305840	Finally, there are institutional sponsors representing about 10%.
305840	309880	Some people take issue with this, especially Bill Gates has come under public scrutiny
309880	314280	and we've been criticized for even working with organizations funded by him.
314280	317500	So let's look at this 10% in more detail.
317500	322260	About 3% of our revenue over the last 8 years came from the Gates organizations for a wide
322260	325560	variety of topics often suggested by us.
325560	331000	5% comes from open philanthropy and is only used for specific projects.
331000	336160	With these funds, we've started Arabic, Hindi, Korean, Japanese, Portuguese, and French
336160	340560	channels bringing more free science content to more people.
340560	344360	Then there's a 2-year funding for original TikTok content, which gives us freedom to
344360	348500	explore and learn how to do short form science communication.
348500	354780	The final 2% came from other organizations like the Red Cross or the UN for example.
354780	359560	We choose institutional sponsors carefully, but if organizations want to fund videos that
359560	364200	help us spread quality information about relevant topics, this is an easy yes for us
364200	366600	if we have the capacity for it.
366600	371720	On top of that, the institutional sponsors we're working with align with our values.
371720	376960	We have contracts with every grant giver or sponsor that bars them from editorial influence
376960	381640	other than suggesting topic areas like global health or climate change.
381640	387740	We agree on video topics together, but sponsors can neither influence details nor our conclusions.
387740	390940	The final decision always remains with us.
390940	394860	And usually we develop the topics of the videos autonomously and tell the sponsor what we're
394860	396420	doing afterwards.
396420	400540	If you're interested in how we research our videos in detail, our head of research wrote
400540	402580	an article about it.
402580	407740	Running an educational YouTube channel is a balancing act that we take very seriously.
407740	412380	We're doing our best to maintain this balance, adjusting whenever necessary.
412380	416980	As a team and a company, we want to grow to give more people access to a science-based
416980	419220	outlook on the world.
419220	421460	This brings us to our final topic.
421460	424100	Why are we doing kurzgesagt?
424100	427260	Our values and our vision.
427260	430300	Our core mission is to spark curiosity.
430300	434960	We want to make science and humanism accessible for as many people as possible.
434960	439480	The effort we put into creating our videos is a way of achieving that.
439480	444420	Our videos are beautiful because that helps to spark curiosity, to understand complex
444420	448540	topics and because it just feels good to create and watch.
448540	453780	Our research is as intensive as it is, so our videos are a good simplification of very
453780	455820	complicated topics.
455820	460340	We want to make people excited about science so they rediscover subjects they hated in
460340	463780	school and see how amazing they are.
463780	470300	On top of curiosity, we want to inspire long-term thinking and a positive, constructive outlook.
470300	476520	Being optimistic about the future of humanity is not mainstream, and we think this is horrible.
476520	481800	Pessimism often sounds smart and gets more views, while optimism can sound naive.
481800	485420	But this is a bias that's not helpful for us as a species.
485420	489760	So despite the gloominess of many topics, we want to approach them with informed and
489760	491980	well-researched optimism.
491980	496420	Not brushing humanity's very real challenges aside, but also not falling into the trap
496420	497980	of pessimism.
497980	502180	We want to inspire you to dream a little about the glorious future that we could actually
502180	505940	build, but only if we believe it's possible.
505940	509440	In the long run, we don't only want to do this on YouTube.
509440	514180	The idea is for Kurzgesagt to be a positive influence across more media.
514180	519180	On our TikTok channel, in the long-form content we're exploring, in apps, in the VR game
519180	523580	that will be released later this year, and the games we plan to make in the future.
523580	526340	Our shop is a central part of this vision.
526340	530620	We start our stories with a video and end them with a poster.
530620	532940	There are so many things we want to do.
532940	537260	And thanks to you watching this right now, we have the freedom to work to the best of
537260	539040	our knowledge and ability.
539040	543220	In the end, we hope you like what we offer and that we'll be doing something worthwhile
543220	545600	for as long as we exist.
545600	550920	And hopefully, we'll have a lasting impact by making science and learning more fun for
550920	553260	as many people as possible.
553260	557280	If you personally want to help us do this, you can watch and share our videos, check
557280	561700	out our shop, become a Patreon, or give us an Adblocker exception.
561700	567260	We exist because of you, and you have no idea how much we appreciate that you're here.
567260	570440	And hopefully, we're less of a black box now.
570440	575760	In any case, doing Kurzgesagt for a decade has been a pretty crazy ride.
575760	581180	And so, from the whole team, thank you so much for being with us all these years.
583260	585400	Thank you.
