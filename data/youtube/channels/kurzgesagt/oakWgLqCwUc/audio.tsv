640	4000	Over the last decade, milk has become a bit controversial.
4800	9360	Some people say it's a necessary and nutritious food, vital for healthy bones.
10000	13120	But others say it can cause cancer and lead to an early death.
13760	17600	So, who's right? And why are we drinking it anyway?
17600	29040	Milk is the basis of every mammal's diet after birth,
29040	31840	when our digestive systems are immature and small.
33200	36960	Basically, it's power food to kick-start our bodies and help us grow.
38160	42480	Milk is rich in fat, vitamins, minerals and milk sugar, lactose.
43440	48320	On top of that, for a while after birth, it also contains antibodies and proteins
48320	51440	that protect us from infections and regulate our immune system.
52400	54400	But it's a lot of effort for mothers to produce.
55280	59920	Eventually, humans stop drinking mother's milk and transition to the diet of their parents.
60880	62880	This is how it's been for thousands of years.
64000	69600	Until about 11,000 years ago, when our ancestors settled down in the first agricultural communities.
70560	75040	Soon, they domesticated the first dairy animals, goats, sheep and cattle.
76320	80000	They found that dairy animals are able to eat useless and abundant stuff
80000	82320	and turn it into nutritious and tasty food.
83360	87760	This made a huge difference in terms of survival, especially in hard times.
88640	92000	So groups that had milk available had an evolutionary advantage.
93040	97760	And through natural selection, it changed the genes of communities who consumed a lot of it.
98240	102400	This adaptation has to do with a specialized enzyme, lactase.
103040	104960	Babies have a lot of it in their system,
104960	108640	so they can break down the milk sugar lactose and digest milk easily.
109680	113360	But the older we grow, the fewer lactase enzymes our body produces.
114240	119440	Worldwide, about 65% of the population do not have the enzyme after infancy,
119440	124160	which means they are not able to digest more than about 150 milliliters each day.
124560	128320	This lactose intolerance is not spread evenly around the world, though.
129280	132800	In some East Asian communities, for example, it's up to 90%.
133760	137200	In Northern Europe and North America, the rates are the lowest overall.
139040	142240	There are probably a few reasons for this uneven distribution.
142240	145040	The trait was first introduced by random mutation,
145040	148080	which happened independently of each other in a few populations.
149520	152880	The fact that farming replaced hunting and gathering more and more animals
152880	156240	created natural selection pressure.
157680	162400	People who were able to digest lactose had more foods at hand, which was an advantage.
163360	166880	The migration of dairy farmers to the north then spread it further,
166880	170080	which probably pushed back populations there that didn't have the trait.
172240	176400	Okay, but if milk has been a valuable part of our diet for thousands of years,
176400	178000	why is it so controversial?
178320	185840	There are a number of claims regarding the negative and positive health effects of milk.
186720	188960	The negative ones cover a wide variety,
190240	195520	from brittle bones to cancer and cardiovascular diseases to intolerance and allergies.
196400	197760	So how do they hold up?
198800	203920	Some older studies found a connection between milk and a high risk of breast, colon,
203920	205040	and prostate cancer.
206640	209920	But meta-analyses found no impact on your cancer risk.
210800	216480	On the contrary, the calcium in milk might even have a protective effect against colon cancer.
216480	221360	Although this could be calcium in general, it's not clear milk plays a role in this effect.
222320	225440	Only studies on prostate cancer showed an increased risk
225440	229040	for people who consumed more than one and a quarter liters of milk a day.
229040	234240	But again, the association is inconsistent and other studies don't find any effect.
235280	239120	We discuss these studies in more detail in our sources document.
239120	244560	All in all, the research seems to show that if you drink between 100 to 250 milliliters
244560	247280	of milk per day, cancer is not a concern.
249280	253760	Similarly, meta-analyses could not find any impact from milk or dairy products
253760	257360	on your risk of heart disease, stroke, or your total mortality.
258320	262560	Some studies even suggested that high blood pressure might be rarer in people who eat
262560	266720	a lot of dairy, although the evidence is not strong enough to claim this with confidence.
268400	271760	The case gets more complicated though when we look at bones.
271760	275840	A number of studies found neither positive nor negative effects for adults.
276720	280880	What most people worry most about though are harmful amounts of pesticides,
280880	282640	antibiotics, or hormones.
283440	287680	There are hormones in milk, but only in very low concentrations.
288400	291760	For example, to get the same amount of hormones as from the pill,
291760	296080	you'd need to drink about 5,000 liters of milk and even if you did,
296080	300240	most hormones would be destroyed by your digestive system before they could affect you.
300800	305760	Which is the reason why so much medication is coated to protect it from our digestion.
306480	311280	For pesticides and antibiotics, there are regulations in most parts of the world
311280	313680	that only allow completely harmless amounts.
314400	318800	Milk that surpasses these thresholds is not allowed to go on the shelf,
318800	321040	so there's nothing in particular to worry about.
321760	325200	Besides allergies and those suffering from lactose intolerances,
325200	329600	the best known negative effects of milk are probably acne and general discomfort
329600	331760	after drinking milk or eating dairy products.
332400	334640	And here, the effects are very real.
334640	340160	For example, skimmed milk has been found to statistically increase the rate of acne by 24%.
340720	344240	Allergies against milk products are especially prevalent among children,
344240	347760	with 1 in 18 kids in Germany suffering from them.
347760	352480	In general, these allergies tend to get better or disappear as they grow older though.
353200	354960	Okay, is milk healthy then?
356160	361840	Milk, no matter if it comes from mothers, cows, sheep, goats, or camels, is a nutrient-dense food.
362880	366800	It contains all necessary macronutrients and many micronutrients.
366800	371040	Especially in regions where people struggle to get enough calories,
371040	374800	milk can contribute to a healthy life and lower child mortality.
376160	378080	For those living in the developed world,
378080	382160	in general milk is not harmful if you are not allergic or intolerant to it.
382800	386480	Especially for children, it's a good way to get large amounts of calcium,
386480	392160	and for vegetarians, it's a good source of vitamin B12 and B vitamins in general.
392160	396240	This does not mean there are not other alternatives with the same effect.
396240	398480	You do not need to drink milk to be healthy.
399920	403120	Milk is also definitely not a substitute for water.
403680	406400	Milk is powerful and the additional calories from
406400	410000	drinking a lot of it on a regular basis can contribute to being overweight.
411040	414960	Especially flavored milk or chocolate milk is more comparable to beverages
414960	416720	like lemonade than a healthy snack.
417440	419040	And there's another thing to consider.
419680	422960	Milk production has a significant impact on the global climate.
423920	429040	About 33% of cropland is used to feed grazing animals, including dairy cattle.
429680	433840	Even though the carbon footprint of dairy products has declined since 1990,
433840	438640	dairy production is still responsible for 3% of all greenhouse gas emissions,
438640	440800	even more than all aeroplanes combined.
441840	444880	Milk is a huge industry and sadly most of its
444880	448000	production in factory farms causes incredible suffering.
448560	454000	Cows are impregnated over and over, separated from their young shortly after birth,
454000	457200	and slaughtered once their tortured bodies are not productive anymore.
457920	461600	We can't ignore that much of the milk we consume stems from an industry
461600	464880	that is basically torture and contributes to climate change.
465920	467520	What about plant-based milk?
468880	474480	In terms of protein levels and nutritional value, only soy milk can compare to cow milk.
474480	479600	The others need to be artificially enriched to reach similar levels of vitamins and calcium,
480560	482560	so they can be an alternative to milk.
484560	486800	And another option might be available soon.
487440	492720	Several startups have created non-animal milk that is nutritionally identical to dairy milk,
492720	496080	for example through fermentation by gene-modified bacteria.
498560	501520	This lab-grown milk can even be turned into cheese,
501520	504080	something that plant-based alternatives struggle with,
504160	509920	because they lack casein and whey protein, the key ingredients that give dairy its taste and structure.
511360	513840	The environmental impact is a different story though.
514960	520400	Many milk alternatives use significantly less energy, land, and less water to produce,
520400	523760	so they have a much lower environmental impact than animal milk.
524400	527920	If you want to have the lowest possible negative impact on the planet,
527920	531040	the best choice is whatever milk alternative is regional.
531040	536400	As with almost any topic, milk is complicated.
537040	539760	It's not harmful for the majority of the population,
539760	542000	and it's crucial for many people around the world.
542720	548080	It's good, nutritious food, but also harmful to the planet and causes a lot of suffering.
548960	553440	We need to decide as a society how we want to deal with these facts.
