1
00:00:00,640 --> 00:00:04,000
Over the last decade, milk has become a bit controversial.

2
00:00:04,800 --> 00:00:09,360
Some people say it's a necessary and nutritious food, vital for healthy bones.

3
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:13,120
But others say it can cause cancer and lead to an early death.

4
00:00:13,760 --> 00:00:17,600
So, who's right? And why are we drinking it anyway?

5
00:00:17,600 --> 00:00:29,040
Milk is the basis of every mammal's diet after birth,

6
00:00:29,040 --> 00:00:31,840
when our digestive systems are immature and small.

7
00:00:33,200 --> 00:00:36,960
Basically, it's power food to kick-start our bodies and help us grow.

8
00:00:38,160 --> 00:00:42,480
Milk is rich in fat, vitamins, minerals and milk sugar, lactose.

9
00:00:43,440 --> 00:00:48,320
On top of that, for a while after birth, it also contains antibodies and proteins

10
00:00:48,320 --> 00:00:51,440
that protect us from infections and regulate our immune system.

11
00:00:52,400 --> 00:00:54,400
But it's a lot of effort for mothers to produce.

12
00:00:55,280 --> 00:00:59,920
Eventually, humans stop drinking mother's milk and transition to the diet of their parents.

13
00:01:00,880 --> 00:01:02,880
This is how it's been for thousands of years.

14
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:09,600
Until about 11,000 years ago, when our ancestors settled down in the first agricultural communities.

15
00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:15,040
Soon, they domesticated the first dairy animals, goats, sheep and cattle.

16
00:01:16,320 --> 00:01:20,000
They found that dairy animals are able to eat useless and abundant stuff

17
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,320
and turn it into nutritious and tasty food.

18
00:01:23,360 --> 00:01:27,760
This made a huge difference in terms of survival, especially in hard times.

19
00:01:28,640 --> 00:01:32,000
So groups that had milk available had an evolutionary advantage.

20
00:01:33,040 --> 00:01:37,760
And through natural selection, it changed the genes of communities who consumed a lot of it.

21
00:01:38,240 --> 00:01:42,400
This adaptation has to do with a specialized enzyme, lactase.

22
00:01:43,040 --> 00:01:44,960
Babies have a lot of it in their system,

23
00:01:44,960 --> 00:01:48,640
so they can break down the milk sugar lactose and digest milk easily.

24
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:53,360
But the older we grow, the fewer lactase enzymes our body produces.

25
00:01:54,240 --> 00:01:59,440
Worldwide, about 65% of the population do not have the enzyme after infancy,

26
00:01:59,440 --> 00:02:04,160
which means they are not able to digest more than about 150 milliliters each day.

27
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:08,320
This lactose intolerance is not spread evenly around the world, though.

28
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:12,800
In some East Asian communities, for example, it's up to 90%.

29
00:02:13,760 --> 00:02:17,200
In Northern Europe and North America, the rates are the lowest overall.

30
00:02:19,040 --> 00:02:22,240
There are probably a few reasons for this uneven distribution.

31
00:02:22,240 --> 00:02:25,040
The trait was first introduced by random mutation,

32
00:02:25,040 --> 00:02:28,080
which happened independently of each other in a few populations.

33
00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:32,880
The fact that farming replaced hunting and gathering more and more animals

34
00:02:32,880 --> 00:02:36,240
created natural selection pressure.

35
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:42,400
People who were able to digest lactose had more foods at hand, which was an advantage.

36
00:02:43,360 --> 00:02:46,880
The migration of dairy farmers to the north then spread it further,

37
00:02:46,880 --> 00:02:50,080
which probably pushed back populations there that didn't have the trait.

38
00:02:52,240 --> 00:02:56,400
Okay, but if milk has been a valuable part of our diet for thousands of years,

39
00:02:56,400 --> 00:02:58,000
why is it so controversial?

40
00:02:58,320 --> 00:03:05,840
There are a number of claims regarding the negative and positive health effects of milk.

41
00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:08,960
The negative ones cover a wide variety,

42
00:03:10,240 --> 00:03:15,520
from brittle bones to cancer and cardiovascular diseases to intolerance and allergies.

43
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:17,760
So how do they hold up?

44
00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:23,920
Some older studies found a connection between milk and a high risk of breast, colon,

45
00:03:23,920 --> 00:03:25,040
and prostate cancer.

46
00:03:26,640 --> 00:03:29,920
But meta-analyses found no impact on your cancer risk.

47
00:03:30,800 --> 00:03:36,480
On the contrary, the calcium in milk might even have a protective effect against colon cancer.

48
00:03:36,480 --> 00:03:41,360
Although this could be calcium in general, it's not clear milk plays a role in this effect.

49
00:03:42,320 --> 00:03:45,440
Only studies on prostate cancer showed an increased risk

50
00:03:45,440 --> 00:03:49,040
for people who consumed more than one and a quarter liters of milk a day.

51
00:03:49,040 --> 00:03:54,240
But again, the association is inconsistent and other studies don't find any effect.

52
00:03:55,280 --> 00:03:59,120
We discuss these studies in more detail in our sources document.

53
00:03:59,120 --> 00:04:04,560
All in all, the research seems to show that if you drink between 100 to 250 milliliters

54
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:07,280
of milk per day, cancer is not a concern.

55
00:04:09,280 --> 00:04:13,760
Similarly, meta-analyses could not find any impact from milk or dairy products

56
00:04:13,760 --> 00:04:17,360
on your risk of heart disease, stroke, or your total mortality.

57
00:04:18,320 --> 00:04:22,560
Some studies even suggested that high blood pressure might be rarer in people who eat

58
00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:26,720
a lot of dairy, although the evidence is not strong enough to claim this with confidence.

59
00:04:28,400 --> 00:04:31,760
The case gets more complicated though when we look at bones.

60
00:04:31,760 --> 00:04:35,840
A number of studies found neither positive nor negative effects for adults.

61
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:40,880
What most people worry most about though are harmful amounts of pesticides,

62
00:04:40,880 --> 00:04:42,640
antibiotics, or hormones.

63
00:04:43,440 --> 00:04:47,680
There are hormones in milk, but only in very low concentrations.

64
00:04:48,400 --> 00:04:51,760
For example, to get the same amount of hormones as from the pill,

65
00:04:51,760 --> 00:04:56,080
you'd need to drink about 5,000 liters of milk and even if you did,

66
00:04:56,080 --> 00:05:00,240
most hormones would be destroyed by your digestive system before they could affect you.

67
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:05,760
Which is the reason why so much medication is coated to protect it from our digestion.

68
00:05:06,480 --> 00:05:11,280
For pesticides and antibiotics, there are regulations in most parts of the world

69
00:05:11,280 --> 00:05:13,680
that only allow completely harmless amounts.

70
00:05:14,400 --> 00:05:18,800
Milk that surpasses these thresholds is not allowed to go on the shelf,

71
00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:21,040
so there's nothing in particular to worry about.

72
00:05:21,760 --> 00:05:25,200
Besides allergies and those suffering from lactose intolerances,

73
00:05:25,200 --> 00:05:29,600
the best known negative effects of milk are probably acne and general discomfort

74
00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:31,760
after drinking milk or eating dairy products.

75
00:05:32,400 --> 00:05:34,640
And here, the effects are very real.

76
00:05:34,640 --> 00:05:40,160
For example, skimmed milk has been found to statistically increase the rate of acne by 24%.

77
00:05:40,720 --> 00:05:44,240
Allergies against milk products are especially prevalent among children,

78
00:05:44,240 --> 00:05:47,760
with 1 in 18 kids in Germany suffering from them.

79
00:05:47,760 --> 00:05:52,480
In general, these allergies tend to get better or disappear as they grow older though.

80
00:05:53,200 --> 00:05:54,960
Okay, is milk healthy then?

81
00:05:56,160 --> 00:06:01,840
Milk, no matter if it comes from mothers, cows, sheep, goats, or camels, is a nutrient-dense food.

82
00:06:02,880 --> 00:06:06,800
It contains all necessary macronutrients and many micronutrients.

83
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:11,040
Especially in regions where people struggle to get enough calories,

84
00:06:11,040 --> 00:06:14,800
milk can contribute to a healthy life and lower child mortality.

85
00:06:16,160 --> 00:06:18,080
For those living in the developed world,

86
00:06:18,080 --> 00:06:22,160
in general milk is not harmful if you are not allergic or intolerant to it.

87
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:26,480
Especially for children, it's a good way to get large amounts of calcium,

88
00:06:26,480 --> 00:06:32,160
and for vegetarians, it's a good source of vitamin B12 and B vitamins in general.

89
00:06:32,160 --> 00:06:36,240
This does not mean there are not other alternatives with the same effect.

90
00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:38,480
You do not need to drink milk to be healthy.

91
00:06:39,920 --> 00:06:43,120
Milk is also definitely not a substitute for water.

92
00:06:43,680 --> 00:06:46,400
Milk is powerful and the additional calories from

93
00:06:46,400 --> 00:06:50,000
drinking a lot of it on a regular basis can contribute to being overweight.

94
00:06:51,040 --> 00:06:54,960
Especially flavored milk or chocolate milk is more comparable to beverages

95
00:06:54,960 --> 00:06:56,720
like lemonade than a healthy snack.

96
00:06:57,440 --> 00:06:59,040
And there's another thing to consider.

97
00:06:59,680 --> 00:07:02,960
Milk production has a significant impact on the global climate.

98
00:07:03,920 --> 00:07:09,040
About 33% of cropland is used to feed grazing animals, including dairy cattle.

99
00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:13,840
Even though the carbon footprint of dairy products has declined since 1990,

100
00:07:13,840 --> 00:07:18,640
dairy production is still responsible for 3% of all greenhouse gas emissions,

101
00:07:18,640 --> 00:07:20,800
even more than all aeroplanes combined.

102
00:07:21,840 --> 00:07:24,880
Milk is a huge industry and sadly most of its

103
00:07:24,880 --> 00:07:28,000
production in factory farms causes incredible suffering.

104
00:07:28,560 --> 00:07:34,000
Cows are impregnated over and over, separated from their young shortly after birth,

105
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:37,200
and slaughtered once their tortured bodies are not productive anymore.

106
00:07:37,920 --> 00:07:41,600
We can't ignore that much of the milk we consume stems from an industry

107
00:07:41,600 --> 00:07:44,880
that is basically torture and contributes to climate change.

108
00:07:45,920 --> 00:07:47,520
What about plant-based milk?

109
00:07:48,880 --> 00:07:54,480
In terms of protein levels and nutritional value, only soy milk can compare to cow milk.

110
00:07:54,480 --> 00:07:59,600
The others need to be artificially enriched to reach similar levels of vitamins and calcium,

111
00:08:00,560 --> 00:08:02,560
so they can be an alternative to milk.

112
00:08:04,560 --> 00:08:06,800
And another option might be available soon.

113
00:08:07,440 --> 00:08:12,720
Several startups have created non-animal milk that is nutritionally identical to dairy milk,

114
00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:16,080
for example through fermentation by gene-modified bacteria.

115
00:08:18,560 --> 00:08:21,520
This lab-grown milk can even be turned into cheese,

116
00:08:21,520 --> 00:08:24,080
something that plant-based alternatives struggle with,

117
00:08:24,160 --> 00:08:29,920
because they lack casein and whey protein, the key ingredients that give dairy its taste and structure.

118
00:08:31,360 --> 00:08:33,840
The environmental impact is a different story though.

119
00:08:34,960 --> 00:08:40,400
Many milk alternatives use significantly less energy, land, and less water to produce,

120
00:08:40,400 --> 00:08:43,760
so they have a much lower environmental impact than animal milk.

121
00:08:44,400 --> 00:08:47,920
If you want to have the lowest possible negative impact on the planet,

122
00:08:47,920 --> 00:08:51,040
the best choice is whatever milk alternative is regional.

123
00:08:51,040 --> 00:08:56,400
As with almost any topic, milk is complicated.

124
00:08:57,040 --> 00:08:59,760
It's not harmful for the majority of the population,

125
00:08:59,760 --> 00:09:02,000
and it's crucial for many people around the world.

126
00:09:02,720 --> 00:09:08,080
It's good, nutritious food, but also harmful to the planet and causes a lot of suffering.

127
00:09:08,960 --> 00:09:13,440
We need to decide as a society how we want to deal with these facts.
