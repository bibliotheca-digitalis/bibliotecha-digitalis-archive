00:00.640 --> 00:04.000
Over the last decade, milk has become a bit controversial.

00:04.800 --> 00:09.360
Some people say it's a necessary and nutritious food, vital for healthy bones.

00:10.000 --> 00:13.120
But others say it can cause cancer and lead to an early death.

00:13.760 --> 00:17.600
So, who's right? And why are we drinking it anyway?

00:17.600 --> 00:29.040
Milk is the basis of every mammal's diet after birth,

00:29.040 --> 00:31.840
when our digestive systems are immature and small.

00:33.200 --> 00:36.960
Basically, it's power food to kick-start our bodies and help us grow.

00:38.160 --> 00:42.480
Milk is rich in fat, vitamins, minerals and milk sugar, lactose.

00:43.440 --> 00:48.320
On top of that, for a while after birth, it also contains antibodies and proteins

00:48.320 --> 00:51.440
that protect us from infections and regulate our immune system.

00:52.400 --> 00:54.400
But it's a lot of effort for mothers to produce.

00:55.280 --> 00:59.920
Eventually, humans stop drinking mother's milk and transition to the diet of their parents.

01:00.880 --> 01:02.880
This is how it's been for thousands of years.

01:04.000 --> 01:09.600
Until about 11,000 years ago, when our ancestors settled down in the first agricultural communities.

01:10.560 --> 01:15.040
Soon, they domesticated the first dairy animals, goats, sheep and cattle.

01:16.320 --> 01:20.000
They found that dairy animals are able to eat useless and abundant stuff

01:20.000 --> 01:22.320
and turn it into nutritious and tasty food.

01:23.360 --> 01:27.760
This made a huge difference in terms of survival, especially in hard times.

01:28.640 --> 01:32.000
So groups that had milk available had an evolutionary advantage.

01:33.040 --> 01:37.760
And through natural selection, it changed the genes of communities who consumed a lot of it.

01:38.240 --> 01:42.400
This adaptation has to do with a specialized enzyme, lactase.

01:43.040 --> 01:44.960
Babies have a lot of it in their system,

01:44.960 --> 01:48.640
so they can break down the milk sugar lactose and digest milk easily.

01:49.680 --> 01:53.360
But the older we grow, the fewer lactase enzymes our body produces.

01:54.240 --> 01:59.440
Worldwide, about 65% of the population do not have the enzyme after infancy,

01:59.440 --> 02:04.160
which means they are not able to digest more than about 150 milliliters each day.

02:04.560 --> 02:08.320
This lactose intolerance is not spread evenly around the world, though.

02:09.280 --> 02:12.800
In some East Asian communities, for example, it's up to 90%.

02:13.760 --> 02:17.200
In Northern Europe and North America, the rates are the lowest overall.

02:19.040 --> 02:22.240
There are probably a few reasons for this uneven distribution.

02:22.240 --> 02:25.040
The trait was first introduced by random mutation,

02:25.040 --> 02:28.080
which happened independently of each other in a few populations.

02:29.520 --> 02:32.880
The fact that farming replaced hunting and gathering more and more animals

02:32.880 --> 02:36.240
created natural selection pressure.

02:37.680 --> 02:42.400
People who were able to digest lactose had more foods at hand, which was an advantage.

02:43.360 --> 02:46.880
The migration of dairy farmers to the north then spread it further,

02:46.880 --> 02:50.080
which probably pushed back populations there that didn't have the trait.

02:52.240 --> 02:56.400
Okay, but if milk has been a valuable part of our diet for thousands of years,

02:56.400 --> 02:58.000
why is it so controversial?

02:58.320 --> 03:05.840
There are a number of claims regarding the negative and positive health effects of milk.

03:06.720 --> 03:08.960
The negative ones cover a wide variety,

03:10.240 --> 03:15.520
from brittle bones to cancer and cardiovascular diseases to intolerance and allergies.

03:16.400 --> 03:17.760
So how do they hold up?

03:18.800 --> 03:23.920
Some older studies found a connection between milk and a high risk of breast, colon,

03:23.920 --> 03:25.040
and prostate cancer.

03:26.640 --> 03:29.920
But meta-analyses found no impact on your cancer risk.

03:30.800 --> 03:36.480
On the contrary, the calcium in milk might even have a protective effect against colon cancer.

03:36.480 --> 03:41.360
Although this could be calcium in general, it's not clear milk plays a role in this effect.

03:42.320 --> 03:45.440
Only studies on prostate cancer showed an increased risk

03:45.440 --> 03:49.040
for people who consumed more than one and a quarter liters of milk a day.

03:49.040 --> 03:54.240
But again, the association is inconsistent and other studies don't find any effect.

03:55.280 --> 03:59.120
We discuss these studies in more detail in our sources document.

03:59.120 --> 04:04.560
All in all, the research seems to show that if you drink between 100 to 250 milliliters

04:04.560 --> 04:07.280
of milk per day, cancer is not a concern.

04:09.280 --> 04:13.760
Similarly, meta-analyses could not find any impact from milk or dairy products

04:13.760 --> 04:17.360
on your risk of heart disease, stroke, or your total mortality.

04:18.320 --> 04:22.560
Some studies even suggested that high blood pressure might be rarer in people who eat

04:22.560 --> 04:26.720
a lot of dairy, although the evidence is not strong enough to claim this with confidence.

04:28.400 --> 04:31.760
The case gets more complicated though when we look at bones.

04:31.760 --> 04:35.840
A number of studies found neither positive nor negative effects for adults.

04:36.720 --> 04:40.880
What most people worry most about though are harmful amounts of pesticides,

04:40.880 --> 04:42.640
antibiotics, or hormones.

04:43.440 --> 04:47.680
There are hormones in milk, but only in very low concentrations.

04:48.400 --> 04:51.760
For example, to get the same amount of hormones as from the pill,

04:51.760 --> 04:56.080
you'd need to drink about 5,000 liters of milk and even if you did,

04:56.080 --> 05:00.240
most hormones would be destroyed by your digestive system before they could affect you.

05:00.800 --> 05:05.760
Which is the reason why so much medication is coated to protect it from our digestion.

05:06.480 --> 05:11.280
For pesticides and antibiotics, there are regulations in most parts of the world

05:11.280 --> 05:13.680
that only allow completely harmless amounts.

05:14.400 --> 05:18.800
Milk that surpasses these thresholds is not allowed to go on the shelf,

05:18.800 --> 05:21.040
so there's nothing in particular to worry about.

05:21.760 --> 05:25.200
Besides allergies and those suffering from lactose intolerances,

05:25.200 --> 05:29.600
the best known negative effects of milk are probably acne and general discomfort

05:29.600 --> 05:31.760
after drinking milk or eating dairy products.

05:32.400 --> 05:34.640
And here, the effects are very real.

05:34.640 --> 05:40.160
For example, skimmed milk has been found to statistically increase the rate of acne by 24%.

05:40.720 --> 05:44.240
Allergies against milk products are especially prevalent among children,

05:44.240 --> 05:47.760
with 1 in 18 kids in Germany suffering from them.

05:47.760 --> 05:52.480
In general, these allergies tend to get better or disappear as they grow older though.

05:53.200 --> 05:54.960
Okay, is milk healthy then?

05:56.160 --> 06:01.840
Milk, no matter if it comes from mothers, cows, sheep, goats, or camels, is a nutrient-dense food.

06:02.880 --> 06:06.800
It contains all necessary macronutrients and many micronutrients.

06:06.800 --> 06:11.040
Especially in regions where people struggle to get enough calories,

06:11.040 --> 06:14.800
milk can contribute to a healthy life and lower child mortality.

06:16.160 --> 06:18.080
For those living in the developed world,

06:18.080 --> 06:22.160
in general milk is not harmful if you are not allergic or intolerant to it.

06:22.800 --> 06:26.480
Especially for children, it's a good way to get large amounts of calcium,

06:26.480 --> 06:32.160
and for vegetarians, it's a good source of vitamin B12 and B vitamins in general.

06:32.160 --> 06:36.240
This does not mean there are not other alternatives with the same effect.

06:36.240 --> 06:38.480
You do not need to drink milk to be healthy.

06:39.920 --> 06:43.120
Milk is also definitely not a substitute for water.

06:43.680 --> 06:46.400
Milk is powerful and the additional calories from

06:46.400 --> 06:50.000
drinking a lot of it on a regular basis can contribute to being overweight.

06:51.040 --> 06:54.960
Especially flavored milk or chocolate milk is more comparable to beverages

06:54.960 --> 06:56.720
like lemonade than a healthy snack.

06:57.440 --> 06:59.040
And there's another thing to consider.

06:59.680 --> 07:02.960
Milk production has a significant impact on the global climate.

07:03.920 --> 07:09.040
About 33% of cropland is used to feed grazing animals, including dairy cattle.

07:09.680 --> 07:13.840
Even though the carbon footprint of dairy products has declined since 1990,

07:13.840 --> 07:18.640
dairy production is still responsible for 3% of all greenhouse gas emissions,

07:18.640 --> 07:20.800
even more than all aeroplanes combined.

07:21.840 --> 07:24.880
Milk is a huge industry and sadly most of its

07:24.880 --> 07:28.000
production in factory farms causes incredible suffering.

07:28.560 --> 07:34.000
Cows are impregnated over and over, separated from their young shortly after birth,

07:34.000 --> 07:37.200
and slaughtered once their tortured bodies are not productive anymore.

07:37.920 --> 07:41.600
We can't ignore that much of the milk we consume stems from an industry

07:41.600 --> 07:44.880
that is basically torture and contributes to climate change.

07:45.920 --> 07:47.520
What about plant-based milk?

07:48.880 --> 07:54.480
In terms of protein levels and nutritional value, only soy milk can compare to cow milk.

07:54.480 --> 07:59.600
The others need to be artificially enriched to reach similar levels of vitamins and calcium,

08:00.560 --> 08:02.560
so they can be an alternative to milk.

08:04.560 --> 08:06.800
And another option might be available soon.

08:07.440 --> 08:12.720
Several startups have created non-animal milk that is nutritionally identical to dairy milk,

08:12.720 --> 08:16.080
for example through fermentation by gene-modified bacteria.

08:18.560 --> 08:21.520
This lab-grown milk can even be turned into cheese,

08:21.520 --> 08:24.080
something that plant-based alternatives struggle with,

08:24.160 --> 08:29.920
because they lack casein and whey protein, the key ingredients that give dairy its taste and structure.

08:31.360 --> 08:33.840
The environmental impact is a different story though.

08:34.960 --> 08:40.400
Many milk alternatives use significantly less energy, land, and less water to produce,

08:40.400 --> 08:43.760
so they have a much lower environmental impact than animal milk.

08:44.400 --> 08:47.920
If you want to have the lowest possible negative impact on the planet,

08:47.920 --> 08:51.040
the best choice is whatever milk alternative is regional.

08:51.040 --> 08:56.400
As with almost any topic, milk is complicated.

08:57.040 --> 08:59.760
It's not harmful for the majority of the population,

08:59.760 --> 09:02.000
and it's crucial for many people around the world.

09:02.720 --> 09:08.080
It's good, nutritious food, but also harmful to the planet and causes a lot of suffering.

09:08.960 --> 09:13.440
We need to decide as a society how we want to deal with these facts.
