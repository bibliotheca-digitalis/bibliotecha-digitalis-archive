00:00.000 --> 00:05.200
For the fifth time, we present to you the human-era calendar for the year 12,021.

00:05.200 --> 00:11.600
This time, it's all about the journey of humanity, beginning tens of thousands of years ago,

00:11.600 --> 00:17.280
leading into the revolution of agriculture, to ancient high civilizations, and the beginning

00:17.280 --> 00:23.280
of modern times, culminating in a vision for our future. You can get the limited edition now,

00:23.280 --> 00:29.120
until we sell out, and then, never again. As always, the calendar features 12 illustrated

00:29.120 --> 00:34.960
pages printed on high-quality paper in Europe and the US. And this year, the cover is especially

00:34.960 --> 00:40.400
shiny. Not only does the calendar look great on walls and makes it easier to dream about a

00:40.400 --> 00:46.320
glorious future and realize how far we've come as a species, it's also the best way to support

00:46.320 --> 00:52.240
Kurzgesagt. The calendar enables us to put in the time our videos need and release them for free,

00:52.240 --> 00:57.360
for everyone. If you want, you can get the calendar with a hoodie or infographic posters

00:57.360 --> 01:02.400
or plushie, we've made a few deals for you. Thank you so much to the thousands of people

01:02.400 --> 01:07.120
who get the calendar every year, and to the burbs who love what we try to do on this channel.

01:08.800 --> 01:23.520
We wish you a happy year 12,021, and let's all hope that it will be less exciting than 12,020.
