0	5200	For the fifth time, we present to you the human-era calendar for the year 12,021.
5200	11600	This time, it's all about the journey of humanity, beginning tens of thousands of years ago,
11600	17280	leading into the revolution of agriculture, to ancient high civilizations, and the beginning
17280	23280	of modern times, culminating in a vision for our future. You can get the limited edition now,
23280	29120	until we sell out, and then, never again. As always, the calendar features 12 illustrated
29120	34960	pages printed on high-quality paper in Europe and the US. And this year, the cover is especially
34960	40400	shiny. Not only does the calendar look great on walls and makes it easier to dream about a
40400	46320	glorious future and realize how far we've come as a species, it's also the best way to support
46320	52240	Kurzgesagt. The calendar enables us to put in the time our videos need and release them for free,
52240	57360	for everyone. If you want, you can get the calendar with a hoodie or infographic posters
57360	62400	or plushie, we've made a few deals for you. Thank you so much to the thousands of people
62400	67120	who get the calendar every year, and to the burbs who love what we try to do on this channel.
68800	83520	We wish you a happy year 12,021, and let's all hope that it will be less exciting than 12,020.
