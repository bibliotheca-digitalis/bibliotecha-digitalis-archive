leading into the revolution of agriculture, to ancient high civilizations, and the beginning

00:00:29,120 --> 00:00:34,960
pages printed on high-quality paper in Europe and the US. And this year, the cover is especially

00:00:34,960 --> 00:00:40,400
shiny. Not only does the calendar look great on walls and makes it easier to dream about a

8
00:00:40,400 --> 00:00:46,320
glorious future and realize how far we've come as a species, it's also the best way to support

00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:52,240
Kurzgesagt. The calendar enables us to put in the time our videos need and release them for free,

for everyone. If you want, you can get the calendar with a hoodie or infographic posters
