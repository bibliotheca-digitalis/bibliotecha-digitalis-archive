00:00.400 --> 00:07.600
The past is a vast and mysterious land that begins at the Big Bang and ends in the present,

00:07.600 --> 00:12.880
expanding with each passing moment. It's the home of everything that came before,

00:12.880 --> 00:18.560
the key to understanding our present. Here, we find the most amazing creatures to ever roam our

00:18.560 --> 00:24.640
planet, hundreds of millions of species so diverse that our imagination cannot do them justice.

00:25.360 --> 00:31.280
Unfortunately, the past carefully guards its secrets. While there are a lot of things about

00:31.280 --> 00:36.400
the past we know, there are way more things we know we don't know, and worse,

00:36.400 --> 00:40.800
there are probably even more things we don't even know that we don't know about.

00:40.800 --> 00:56.320
Think of the wonder of life. We now recognize about 1.5 million eukaryotic species,

00:56.320 --> 01:03.040
but there may be as many as 10 million alive today. And, although we are adding some 15,000

01:03.040 --> 01:07.640
new species to our collective knowledge each year, the vast majority of life on earth is

01:08.040 --> 01:16.120
still undiscovered. This is just what is around today. An estimated 4 billion species emerged

01:16.120 --> 01:23.400
on our planet in past eons. But at least 99% of them died out way before humans spoke the first

01:23.400 --> 01:30.280
words. The vast majority of all the different species that ever existed are so utterly deleted

01:30.280 --> 01:36.520
that they have become part of the unknown unknown part of the past, lost to us forever.

01:37.640 --> 01:45.160
Or are they? Could we use science and imagination to glimpse a shadow of the unreachable past?

01:46.440 --> 01:52.360
Let's start with what we do know. To learn about creatures of the past we need fossils,

01:52.360 --> 01:59.240
any sort of remains preserved from past geological ages, bones or shells, impressions or imprints,

01:59.240 --> 02:05.560
things preserved in amber. The totality of all fossils on earth is called the fossil record,

02:05.560 --> 02:08.520
and it's the most important window on the past we'll ever have.

02:09.560 --> 02:16.200
For a dead animal to fossilize, a number of things must go just right. The right environment, timing

02:16.200 --> 02:21.240
and conditions. And then the fossil needs to survive for millions or hundreds of millions

02:21.240 --> 02:26.280
of years, and then get back to the surface, and then be discovered before natural processes

02:26.280 --> 02:32.280
dissolve it. So it is kind of a miracle that we have what we have, and know what we know.

02:33.160 --> 02:38.440
Take the dinosaurs, since they were one of the largest and most successful groups of animals

02:38.440 --> 02:45.880
for some 165 million years, and are also a lot of fun to animate. What were they really like,

02:45.880 --> 02:52.120
and what are we missing? In the last 200 years, we've found tens of thousands of fossils from

02:52.120 --> 02:58.600
over 1000 dinosaur species. Lately, we've entered a golden era of discovery, and about 50 new

02:58.600 --> 03:03.320
dinosaur species are discovered each year, expanding what we know and what we know that

03:03.320 --> 03:08.520
we don't know about them, which is amazing. But it also makes us aware of all the things

03:08.520 --> 03:14.520
lost to the past forever. Imagine if we took all the animals that lived in the last 50 million

03:14.520 --> 03:21.960
years, and randomly chose 10,000 individuals from 1000 species to fossilize. Think about all the

03:21.960 --> 03:27.240
things that would be missed, or that seemed too weird to be true. Like the giraffe, a yellow

03:27.320 --> 03:32.440
animal with brown patterns that looks like a horse and an antelope had a baby with a long neck and

03:32.440 --> 03:40.360
two tiny hairy horns. How many dinosaur giraffes were there? Animals so weird and selected for

03:40.360 --> 03:46.280
ecological niches so specific that evolution molded their bodies very absurdly. Today they

03:46.280 --> 03:53.320
might seem made up to us. We know a lot of species are lost forever just because of the environment

03:53.320 --> 03:59.240
they lived in. For example, lush jungles basically prevent fossilization, as the chances

03:59.240 --> 04:05.000
that an animal will be buried here are low. Countless scavengers of all sizes break down

04:05.000 --> 04:09.880
freshly deceased animals extremely quickly, and the soil is often so acidic that bones are

04:09.880 --> 04:16.440
dissolved. And so fossils of dinosaurs from jungles are practically non existent. Today,

04:16.440 --> 04:21.800
half of all known species live in the few remaining rainforests that only cover 2% of

04:21.800 --> 04:27.640
Earth's landmass. Millions of years ago, when dinosaurs roamed Earth, jungles covered much

04:27.640 --> 04:33.560
more of the planet. So besides some insects and other small animals trapped in amber,

04:33.560 --> 04:39.480
there should be millions of species that emerged and vanished without leaving any trace. Trapped

04:39.480 --> 04:47.080
deep inside the unknown unknown. But just in general, biology trips us up. Look at your body.

04:47.080 --> 04:53.080
It's mainly squishy, gooey soft stuff, which does not preserve well. What remains the longest are

04:53.080 --> 04:59.080
the crystallized parts of your bones. And so most dinosaur fossils are bones or teeth, usually

04:59.080 --> 05:05.880
fragments, not entire skeletons. This means that almost all boneless or shell this animals are

05:05.880 --> 05:11.320
practically wiped from the fossil record. If we take a look at the stunning diversity of weird

05:11.320 --> 05:17.560
animals like worms, jellyfish and slugs alive today, we can only speculate what we are missing.

05:17.560 --> 05:23.080
Although thankfully, many mostly soft and gooey species also left us an incredible diversity of

05:23.080 --> 05:29.320
shells that tell us an amazing amount about our past. So at least we have that. Still,

05:29.320 --> 05:34.040
when we think about all the boneless species that may have existed in the last half billion years,

05:34.040 --> 05:40.040
even our best attempt at imagining them fall short. But it's not like reimagining something

05:40.040 --> 05:45.640
based on its bones is straightforward. And so the way we envisage what dinosaurs actually look like

05:45.640 --> 05:51.000
has changed a lot in the last few years. In the past, many illustrations had a bony

05:51.000 --> 05:57.480
minimalistic look with a toothy grin to signify fastness and danger. But if we draw today's

05:57.480 --> 06:02.920
animals in a similar way, based on their skeletons, just for the fun of it, we get the most bizarre

06:02.920 --> 06:09.560
creatures, elephants, swans and baboons that look like monsters right out of nightmares.

06:10.360 --> 06:16.360
So similar to animals today, we should imagine dinosaurs with much more soft tissue, fat bellies

06:16.360 --> 06:22.760
or chests with soft parts like skin flaps, lips and gums, and just more pronounced features that

06:22.760 --> 06:28.040
would make them seem like much more pleasant fellows. Some soft features actually leave

06:28.040 --> 06:32.680
distinctive traces on bones that we can look for in the skeletons of extinct animals,

06:32.680 --> 06:36.440
which is where today's animals with similar features are really helpful.

06:37.320 --> 06:42.840
It's a similar story with colors. Because we know what the feathers of living birds look like,

06:42.840 --> 06:47.400
modern technology combined with the exceedingly rare fossils with preserved remains of fuzzy

06:47.400 --> 06:53.880
feathers, give us a glimpse of the real colors of extinct dinosaurs. We know that tiny Sinosauropteryx

06:53.880 --> 06:59.640
had a striped tail, and its tiny dino buddy Anchiornis huxleye was white and black with

06:59.640 --> 07:05.720
gorgeous red feathers around its head. Still, for the vast majority of really any ancient extinct

07:05.720 --> 07:11.960
species, we have no real clue what color they were. But we know what modern dinosaurs birds

07:11.960 --> 07:18.280
look like. And here we find the most amazing variety. So some dinosaurs will have tried to

07:18.280 --> 07:23.480
blend into the background, while others might have fielded aggressive color schemes to attract mates

07:23.480 --> 07:28.600
or to appear dangerous. Some might have had impressive decorations or colorful beaks.

07:29.400 --> 07:34.520
Some may have been striped or patterned. Similarly, we don't know that much about

07:34.520 --> 07:39.320
dinosaur behavior. Although once again, we can draw conclusions from existing animals.

07:39.320 --> 07:45.400
For example, even apex predators like lions spend a lot of their time lying around and cuddling and

07:45.400 --> 07:51.640
licking each other and playing. Why would dinosaurs be so different? When we first found the skull of

07:51.640 --> 07:56.440
T. rex with its mighty teeth, and probably the strongest bite of any land animal ever,

07:56.440 --> 08:02.680
we imagined a fierce and stupid beast. But modern scanning technology has revealed that T. rex had

08:02.680 --> 08:08.440
a larger brain to body ratio than some earlier giant meat eaters. And it probably had very sharp

08:08.440 --> 08:15.400
hearing vision and a sense of smell and was in all likelihood not a stupid animal. So maybe T. rex

08:15.400 --> 08:19.960
was a cuddly fellow that spent a lot of time playing around or impressing potential mates

08:19.960 --> 08:25.720
when it was not hungry. Likewise, while their horns and shields might have made ceratopsids

08:25.720 --> 08:30.600
appear to be natural born fighters, they were probably much more than that. Based on the

08:30.600 --> 08:35.720
behavior of modern animals, and the complex dances some have to go through to mate, maybe their

08:35.720 --> 08:42.520
shields were amazingly colorful. Maybe it danced for its mates like many birds do today. How

08:42.520 --> 08:48.840
intensely amazing these creatures must have been. And what a loss it is to us that we don't get to

08:48.840 --> 08:54.680
experience them firsthand. What an even greater loss that there is so much we will never know

08:54.680 --> 09:00.600
about them and even more tragic, all the absurd and beautiful beings that disappeared without a

09:00.600 --> 09:08.440
trace. But such is life. Time marches on without any concern for our feelings, and the past expands

09:08.440 --> 09:14.920
with every moment that passes. Most wild animals alive today will in all likelihood not leave

09:14.920 --> 09:21.800
fossils behind and also just disappear forever. We can do something about that though. Instead

09:21.800 --> 09:27.080
of accelerating the extinction we are witnessing, we could become the guardians of life and preserve

09:27.080 --> 09:33.800
it where we find it. If possible in the wild, if not then in museums, movies and in our minds.

09:34.440 --> 09:39.560
Because as amazing as our imagination is, and as fascinating to think about the animals that are

09:39.560 --> 09:46.440
part of the unknown unknown, it is even better to witness them in the present. The land that we

09:46.440 --> 09:56.440
actually inhabit, where we get to experience life as it happens. There is one more exciting way to

09:56.440 --> 10:04.520
experience dinosaurs though this year, the 12,022 human era calendar eons edition. As always we're

10:04.520 --> 10:09.480
adding 10,000 years to the regular calendar to represent the human era and include all cultures

10:09.480 --> 10:15.080
around the world. But this year we're expanding the scope beyond humanity to showcase forgotten

10:15.080 --> 10:21.160
animals and plants from all across the Phanerozoic eon, like giant armored fish, scythe lizards or

10:21.160 --> 10:27.720
giant sloths on 12 elaborate pages. Witness how multicellular life has persisted for over half

10:27.720 --> 10:33.480
a billion years, surviving asteroid impacts, volcanoes and frozen oceans and of course

10:33.480 --> 10:43.160
pandemics. In the end life finds a way and we want to celebrate that. You can get the very shiny high

10:43.160 --> 10:49.080
