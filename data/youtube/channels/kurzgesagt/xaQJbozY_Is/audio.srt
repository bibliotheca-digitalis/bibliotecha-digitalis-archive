1
00:00:00,400 --> 00:00:07,600
The past is a vast and mysterious land that begins at the Big Bang and ends in the present,

2
00:00:07,600 --> 00:00:12,880
expanding with each passing moment. It's the home of everything that came before,

3
00:00:12,880 --> 00:00:18,560
the key to understanding our present. Here, we find the most amazing creatures to ever roam our

4
00:00:18,560 --> 00:00:24,640
planet, hundreds of millions of species so diverse that our imagination cannot do them justice.

5
00:00:25,360 --> 00:00:31,280
Unfortunately, the past carefully guards its secrets. While there are a lot of things about

6
00:00:31,280 --> 00:00:36,400
the past we know, there are way more things we know we don't know, and worse,

7
00:00:36,400 --> 00:00:40,800
there are probably even more things we don't even know that we don't know about.

8
00:00:40,800 --> 00:00:56,320
Think of the wonder of life. We now recognize about 1.5 million eukaryotic species,

9
00:00:56,320 --> 00:01:03,040
but there may be as many as 10 million alive today. And, although we are adding some 15,000

10
00:01:03,040 --> 00:01:07,640
new species to our collective knowledge each year, the vast majority of life on earth is

11
00:01:08,040 --> 00:01:16,120
still undiscovered. This is just what is around today. An estimated 4 billion species emerged

12
00:01:16,120 --> 00:01:23,400
on our planet in past eons. But at least 99% of them died out way before humans spoke the first

13
00:01:23,400 --> 00:01:30,280
words. The vast majority of all the different species that ever existed are so utterly deleted

14
00:01:30,280 --> 00:01:36,520
that they have become part of the unknown unknown part of the past, lost to us forever.

15
00:01:37,640 --> 00:01:45,160
Or are they? Could we use science and imagination to glimpse a shadow of the unreachable past?

16
00:01:46,440 --> 00:01:52,360
Let's start with what we do know. To learn about creatures of the past we need fossils,

17
00:01:52,360 --> 00:01:59,240
any sort of remains preserved from past geological ages, bones or shells, impressions or imprints,

18
00:01:59,240 --> 00:02:05,560
things preserved in amber. The totality of all fossils on earth is called the fossil record,

19
00:02:05,560 --> 00:02:08,520
and it's the most important window on the past we'll ever have.

20
00:02:09,560 --> 00:02:16,200
For a dead animal to fossilize, a number of things must go just right. The right environment, timing

21
00:02:16,200 --> 00:02:21,240
and conditions. And then the fossil needs to survive for millions or hundreds of millions

22
00:02:21,240 --> 00:02:26,280
of years, and then get back to the surface, and then be discovered before natural processes

23
00:02:26,280 --> 00:02:32,280
dissolve it. So it is kind of a miracle that we have what we have, and know what we know.

24
00:02:33,160 --> 00:02:38,440
Take the dinosaurs, since they were one of the largest and most successful groups of animals

25
00:02:38,440 --> 00:02:45,880
for some 165 million years, and are also a lot of fun to animate. What were they really like,

26
00:02:45,880 --> 00:02:52,120
and what are we missing? In the last 200 years, we've found tens of thousands of fossils from

27
00:02:52,120 --> 00:02:58,600
over 1000 dinosaur species. Lately, we've entered a golden era of discovery, and about 50 new

28
00:02:58,600 --> 00:03:03,320
dinosaur species are discovered each year, expanding what we know and what we know that

29
00:03:03,320 --> 00:03:08,520
we don't know about them, which is amazing. But it also makes us aware of all the things

30
00:03:08,520 --> 00:03:14,520
lost to the past forever. Imagine if we took all the animals that lived in the last 50 million

31
00:03:14,520 --> 00:03:21,960
years, and randomly chose 10,000 individuals from 1000 species to fossilize. Think about all the

32
00:03:21,960 --> 00:03:27,240
things that would be missed, or that seemed too weird to be true. Like the giraffe, a yellow

33
00:03:27,320 --> 00:03:32,440
animal with brown patterns that looks like a horse and an antelope had a baby with a long neck and

34
00:03:32,440 --> 00:03:40,360
two tiny hairy horns. How many dinosaur giraffes were there? Animals so weird and selected for

35
00:03:40,360 --> 00:03:46,280
ecological niches so specific that evolution molded their bodies very absurdly. Today they

36
00:03:46,280 --> 00:03:53,320
might seem made up to us. We know a lot of species are lost forever just because of the environment

37
00:03:53,320 --> 00:03:59,240
they lived in. For example, lush jungles basically prevent fossilization, as the chances

38
00:03:59,240 --> 00:04:05,000
that an animal will be buried here are low. Countless scavengers of all sizes break down

39
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:09,880
freshly deceased animals extremely quickly, and the soil is often so acidic that bones are

40
00:04:09,880 --> 00:04:16,440
dissolved. And so fossils of dinosaurs from jungles are practically non existent. Today,

41
00:04:16,440 --> 00:04:21,800
half of all known species live in the few remaining rainforests that only cover 2% of

42
00:04:21,800 --> 00:04:27,640
Earth's landmass. Millions of years ago, when dinosaurs roamed Earth, jungles covered much

43
00:04:27,640 --> 00:04:33,560
more of the planet. So besides some insects and other small animals trapped in amber,

44
00:04:33,560 --> 00:04:39,480
there should be millions of species that emerged and vanished without leaving any trace. Trapped

45
00:04:39,480 --> 00:04:47,080
deep inside the unknown unknown. But just in general, biology trips us up. Look at your body.

46
00:04:47,080 --> 00:04:53,080
It's mainly squishy, gooey soft stuff, which does not preserve well. What remains the longest are

47
00:04:53,080 --> 00:04:59,080
the crystallized parts of your bones. And so most dinosaur fossils are bones or teeth, usually

48
00:04:59,080 --> 00:05:05,880
fragments, not entire skeletons. This means that almost all boneless or shell this animals are

49
00:05:05,880 --> 00:05:11,320
practically wiped from the fossil record. If we take a look at the stunning diversity of weird

50
00:05:11,320 --> 00:05:17,560
animals like worms, jellyfish and slugs alive today, we can only speculate what we are missing.

51
00:05:17,560 --> 00:05:23,080
Although thankfully, many mostly soft and gooey species also left us an incredible diversity of

52
00:05:23,080 --> 00:05:29,320
shells that tell us an amazing amount about our past. So at least we have that. Still,

53
00:05:29,320 --> 00:05:34,040
when we think about all the boneless species that may have existed in the last half billion years,

54
00:05:34,040 --> 00:05:40,040
even our best attempt at imagining them fall short. But it's not like reimagining something

55
00:05:40,040 --> 00:05:45,640
based on its bones is straightforward. And so the way we envisage what dinosaurs actually look like

56
00:05:45,640 --> 00:05:51,000
has changed a lot in the last few years. In the past, many illustrations had a bony

57
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:57,480
minimalistic look with a toothy grin to signify fastness and danger. But if we draw today's

58
00:05:57,480 --> 00:06:02,920
animals in a similar way, based on their skeletons, just for the fun of it, we get the most bizarre

59
00:06:02,920 --> 00:06:09,560
creatures, elephants, swans and baboons that look like monsters right out of nightmares.

60
00:06:10,360 --> 00:06:16,360
So similar to animals today, we should imagine dinosaurs with much more soft tissue, fat bellies

61
00:06:16,360 --> 00:06:22,760
or chests with soft parts like skin flaps, lips and gums, and just more pronounced features that

62
00:06:22,760 --> 00:06:28,040
would make them seem like much more pleasant fellows. Some soft features actually leave

63
00:06:28,040 --> 00:06:32,680
distinctive traces on bones that we can look for in the skeletons of extinct animals,

64
00:06:32,680 --> 00:06:36,440
which is where today's animals with similar features are really helpful.

65
00:06:37,320 --> 00:06:42,840
It's a similar story with colors. Because we know what the feathers of living birds look like,

66
00:06:42,840 --> 00:06:47,400
modern technology combined with the exceedingly rare fossils with preserved remains of fuzzy

67
00:06:47,400 --> 00:06:53,880
feathers, give us a glimpse of the real colors of extinct dinosaurs. We know that tiny Sinosauropteryx

68
00:06:53,880 --> 00:06:59,640
had a striped tail, and its tiny dino buddy Anchiornis huxleye was white and black with

69
00:06:59,640 --> 00:07:05,720
gorgeous red feathers around its head. Still, for the vast majority of really any ancient extinct

70
00:07:05,720 --> 00:07:11,960
species, we have no real clue what color they were. But we know what modern dinosaurs birds

71
00:07:11,960 --> 00:07:18,280
look like. And here we find the most amazing variety. So some dinosaurs will have tried to

72
00:07:18,280 --> 00:07:23,480
blend into the background, while others might have fielded aggressive color schemes to attract mates

73
00:07:23,480 --> 00:07:28,600
or to appear dangerous. Some might have had impressive decorations or colorful beaks.

74
00:07:29,400 --> 00:07:34,520
Some may have been striped or patterned. Similarly, we don't know that much about

75
00:07:34,520 --> 00:07:39,320
dinosaur behavior. Although once again, we can draw conclusions from existing animals.

76
00:07:39,320 --> 00:07:45,400
For example, even apex predators like lions spend a lot of their time lying around and cuddling and

77
00:07:45,400 --> 00:07:51,640
licking each other and playing. Why would dinosaurs be so different? When we first found the skull of

78
00:07:51,640 --> 00:07:56,440
T. rex with its mighty teeth, and probably the strongest bite of any land animal ever,

79
00:07:56,440 --> 00:08:02,680
we imagined a fierce and stupid beast. But modern scanning technology has revealed that T. rex had

80
00:08:02,680 --> 00:08:08,440
a larger brain to body ratio than some earlier giant meat eaters. And it probably had very sharp

81
00:08:08,440 --> 00:08:15,400
hearing vision and a sense of smell and was in all likelihood not a stupid animal. So maybe T. rex

82
00:08:15,400 --> 00:08:19,960
was a cuddly fellow that spent a lot of time playing around or impressing potential mates

83
00:08:19,960 --> 00:08:25,720
when it was not hungry. Likewise, while their horns and shields might have made ceratopsids

84
00:08:25,720 --> 00:08:30,600
appear to be natural born fighters, they were probably much more than that. Based on the

85
00:08:30,600 --> 00:08:35,720
behavior of modern animals, and the complex dances some have to go through to mate, maybe their

86
00:08:35,720 --> 00:08:42,520
shields were amazingly colorful. Maybe it danced for its mates like many birds do today. How

87
00:08:42,520 --> 00:08:48,840
intensely amazing these creatures must have been. And what a loss it is to us that we don't get to

88
00:08:48,840 --> 00:08:54,680
experience them firsthand. What an even greater loss that there is so much we will never know

89
00:08:54,680 --> 00:09:00,600
about them and even more tragic, all the absurd and beautiful beings that disappeared without a

90
00:09:00,600 --> 00:09:08,440
trace. But such is life. Time marches on without any concern for our feelings, and the past expands

91
00:09:08,440 --> 00:09:14,920
with every moment that passes. Most wild animals alive today will in all likelihood not leave

92
00:09:14,920 --> 00:09:21,800
fossils behind and also just disappear forever. We can do something about that though. Instead

93
00:09:21,800 --> 00:09:27,080
of accelerating the extinction we are witnessing, we could become the guardians of life and preserve

94
00:09:27,080 --> 00:09:33,800
it where we find it. If possible in the wild, if not then in museums, movies and in our minds.

95
00:09:34,440 --> 00:09:39,560
Because as amazing as our imagination is, and as fascinating to think about the animals that are

96
00:09:39,560 --> 00:09:46,440
part of the unknown unknown, it is even better to witness them in the present. The land that we

97
00:09:46,440 --> 00:09:56,440
actually inhabit, where we get to experience life as it happens. There is one more exciting way to

98
00:09:56,440 --> 00:10:04,520
experience dinosaurs though this year, the 12,022 human era calendar eons edition. As always we're

99
00:10:04,520 --> 00:10:09,480
adding 10,000 years to the regular calendar to represent the human era and include all cultures

100
00:10:09,480 --> 00:10:15,080
around the world. But this year we're expanding the scope beyond humanity to showcase forgotten

101
00:10:15,080 --> 00:10:21,160
animals and plants from all across the Phanerozoic eon, like giant armored fish, scythe lizards or

102
00:10:21,160 --> 00:10:27,720
giant sloths on 12 elaborate pages. Witness how multicellular life has persisted for over half

103
00:10:27,720 --> 00:10:33,480
a billion years, surviving asteroid impacts, volcanoes and frozen oceans and of course

104
00:10:33,480 --> 00:10:43,160
pandemics. In the end life finds a way and we want to celebrate that. You can get the very shiny high
