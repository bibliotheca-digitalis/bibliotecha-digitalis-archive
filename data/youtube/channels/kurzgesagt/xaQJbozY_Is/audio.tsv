400	7600	The past is a vast and mysterious land that begins at the Big Bang and ends in the present,
7600	12880	expanding with each passing moment. It's the home of everything that came before,
12880	18560	the key to understanding our present. Here, we find the most amazing creatures to ever roam our
18560	24640	planet, hundreds of millions of species so diverse that our imagination cannot do them justice.
25360	31280	Unfortunately, the past carefully guards its secrets. While there are a lot of things about
31280	36400	the past we know, there are way more things we know we don't know, and worse,
36400	40800	there are probably even more things we don't even know that we don't know about.
40800	56320	Think of the wonder of life. We now recognize about 1.5 million eukaryotic species,
56320	63040	but there may be as many as 10 million alive today. And, although we are adding some 15,000
63040	67640	new species to our collective knowledge each year, the vast majority of life on earth is
68040	76120	still undiscovered. This is just what is around today. An estimated 4 billion species emerged
76120	83400	on our planet in past eons. But at least 99% of them died out way before humans spoke the first
83400	90280	words. The vast majority of all the different species that ever existed are so utterly deleted
90280	96520	that they have become part of the unknown unknown part of the past, lost to us forever.
97640	105160	Or are they? Could we use science and imagination to glimpse a shadow of the unreachable past?
106440	112360	Let's start with what we do know. To learn about creatures of the past we need fossils,
112360	119240	any sort of remains preserved from past geological ages, bones or shells, impressions or imprints,
119240	125560	things preserved in amber. The totality of all fossils on earth is called the fossil record,
125560	128520	and it's the most important window on the past we'll ever have.
129560	136200	For a dead animal to fossilize, a number of things must go just right. The right environment, timing
136200	141240	and conditions. And then the fossil needs to survive for millions or hundreds of millions
141240	146280	of years, and then get back to the surface, and then be discovered before natural processes
146280	152280	dissolve it. So it is kind of a miracle that we have what we have, and know what we know.
153160	158440	Take the dinosaurs, since they were one of the largest and most successful groups of animals
158440	165880	for some 165 million years, and are also a lot of fun to animate. What were they really like,
165880	172120	and what are we missing? In the last 200 years, we've found tens of thousands of fossils from
172120	178600	over 1000 dinosaur species. Lately, we've entered a golden era of discovery, and about 50 new
178600	183320	dinosaur species are discovered each year, expanding what we know and what we know that
183320	188520	we don't know about them, which is amazing. But it also makes us aware of all the things
188520	194520	lost to the past forever. Imagine if we took all the animals that lived in the last 50 million
194520	201960	years, and randomly chose 10,000 individuals from 1000 species to fossilize. Think about all the
201960	207240	things that would be missed, or that seemed too weird to be true. Like the giraffe, a yellow
207320	212440	animal with brown patterns that looks like a horse and an antelope had a baby with a long neck and
212440	220360	two tiny hairy horns. How many dinosaur giraffes were there? Animals so weird and selected for
220360	226280	ecological niches so specific that evolution molded their bodies very absurdly. Today they
226280	233320	might seem made up to us. We know a lot of species are lost forever just because of the environment
233320	239240	they lived in. For example, lush jungles basically prevent fossilization, as the chances
239240	245000	that an animal will be buried here are low. Countless scavengers of all sizes break down
245000	249880	freshly deceased animals extremely quickly, and the soil is often so acidic that bones are
249880	256440	dissolved. And so fossils of dinosaurs from jungles are practically non existent. Today,
256440	261800	half of all known species live in the few remaining rainforests that only cover 2% of
261800	267640	Earth's landmass. Millions of years ago, when dinosaurs roamed Earth, jungles covered much
267640	273560	more of the planet. So besides some insects and other small animals trapped in amber,
273560	279480	there should be millions of species that emerged and vanished without leaving any trace. Trapped
279480	287080	deep inside the unknown unknown. But just in general, biology trips us up. Look at your body.
287080	293080	It's mainly squishy, gooey soft stuff, which does not preserve well. What remains the longest are
293080	299080	the crystallized parts of your bones. And so most dinosaur fossils are bones or teeth, usually
299080	305880	fragments, not entire skeletons. This means that almost all boneless or shell this animals are
305880	311320	practically wiped from the fossil record. If we take a look at the stunning diversity of weird
311320	317560	animals like worms, jellyfish and slugs alive today, we can only speculate what we are missing.
317560	323080	Although thankfully, many mostly soft and gooey species also left us an incredible diversity of
323080	329320	shells that tell us an amazing amount about our past. So at least we have that. Still,
329320	334040	when we think about all the boneless species that may have existed in the last half billion years,
334040	340040	even our best attempt at imagining them fall short. But it's not like reimagining something
340040	345640	based on its bones is straightforward. And so the way we envisage what dinosaurs actually look like
345640	351000	has changed a lot in the last few years. In the past, many illustrations had a bony
351000	357480	minimalistic look with a toothy grin to signify fastness and danger. But if we draw today's
357480	362920	animals in a similar way, based on their skeletons, just for the fun of it, we get the most bizarre
362920	369560	creatures, elephants, swans and baboons that look like monsters right out of nightmares.
370360	376360	So similar to animals today, we should imagine dinosaurs with much more soft tissue, fat bellies
376360	382760	or chests with soft parts like skin flaps, lips and gums, and just more pronounced features that
382760	388040	would make them seem like much more pleasant fellows. Some soft features actually leave
388040	392680	distinctive traces on bones that we can look for in the skeletons of extinct animals,
392680	396440	which is where today's animals with similar features are really helpful.
397320	402840	It's a similar story with colors. Because we know what the feathers of living birds look like,
402840	407400	modern technology combined with the exceedingly rare fossils with preserved remains of fuzzy
407400	413880	feathers, give us a glimpse of the real colors of extinct dinosaurs. We know that tiny Sinosauropteryx
413880	419640	had a striped tail, and its tiny dino buddy Anchiornis huxleye was white and black with
419640	425720	gorgeous red feathers around its head. Still, for the vast majority of really any ancient extinct
425720	431960	species, we have no real clue what color they were. But we know what modern dinosaurs birds
431960	438280	look like. And here we find the most amazing variety. So some dinosaurs will have tried to
438280	443480	blend into the background, while others might have fielded aggressive color schemes to attract mates
443480	448600	or to appear dangerous. Some might have had impressive decorations or colorful beaks.
449400	454520	Some may have been striped or patterned. Similarly, we don't know that much about
454520	459320	dinosaur behavior. Although once again, we can draw conclusions from existing animals.
459320	465400	For example, even apex predators like lions spend a lot of their time lying around and cuddling and
465400	471640	licking each other and playing. Why would dinosaurs be so different? When we first found the skull of
471640	476440	T. rex with its mighty teeth, and probably the strongest bite of any land animal ever,
476440	482680	we imagined a fierce and stupid beast. But modern scanning technology has revealed that T. rex had
482680	488440	a larger brain to body ratio than some earlier giant meat eaters. And it probably had very sharp
488440	495400	hearing vision and a sense of smell and was in all likelihood not a stupid animal. So maybe T. rex
495400	499960	was a cuddly fellow that spent a lot of time playing around or impressing potential mates
499960	505720	when it was not hungry. Likewise, while their horns and shields might have made ceratopsids
505720	510600	appear to be natural born fighters, they were probably much more than that. Based on the
510600	515720	behavior of modern animals, and the complex dances some have to go through to mate, maybe their
515720	522520	shields were amazingly colorful. Maybe it danced for its mates like many birds do today. How
522520	528840	intensely amazing these creatures must have been. And what a loss it is to us that we don't get to
528840	534680	experience them firsthand. What an even greater loss that there is so much we will never know
534680	540600	about them and even more tragic, all the absurd and beautiful beings that disappeared without a
540600	548440	trace. But such is life. Time marches on without any concern for our feelings, and the past expands
548440	554920	with every moment that passes. Most wild animals alive today will in all likelihood not leave
554920	561800	fossils behind and also just disappear forever. We can do something about that though. Instead
561800	567080	of accelerating the extinction we are witnessing, we could become the guardians of life and preserve
567080	573800	it where we find it. If possible in the wild, if not then in museums, movies and in our minds.
574440	579560	Because as amazing as our imagination is, and as fascinating to think about the animals that are
579560	586440	part of the unknown unknown, it is even better to witness them in the present. The land that we
586440	596440	actually inhabit, where we get to experience life as it happens. There is one more exciting way to
596440	604520	experience dinosaurs though this year, the 12,022 human era calendar eons edition. As always we're
604520	609480	adding 10,000 years to the regular calendar to represent the human era and include all cultures
609480	615080	around the world. But this year we're expanding the scope beyond humanity to showcase forgotten
615080	621160	animals and plants from all across the Phanerozoic eon, like giant armored fish, scythe lizards or
621160	627720	giant sloths on 12 elaborate pages. Witness how multicellular life has persisted for over half
627720	633480	a billion years, surviving asteroid impacts, volcanoes and frozen oceans and of course
633480	643160	pandemics. In the end life finds a way and we want to celebrate that. You can get the very shiny high
