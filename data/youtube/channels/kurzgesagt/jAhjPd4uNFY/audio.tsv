0	5880	Imagine you were alive back in the 1980s, and were told that computers would soon take
5880	10820	over everything, from shopping, to dating, and the stock market.
10820	14640	That billions of people would be connected via a kind of web.
14640	20080	That you would own a handheld device, orders of magnitude more powerful than supercomputers.
20080	24080	It would seem absurd, but then all of it happened.
24080	28440	Science fiction became our reality, and we don't even think about it.
28440	31780	We're at a similar point today with genetic engineering.
31780	33920	So let's talk about it.
33920	38480	Where it came from, what we're doing right now, and about a recent breakthrough that
38480	43120	will change how we live and what we perceive as normal forever.
43120	60120	Humans have been engineering life for thousands of years.
60120	64720	Through selective breeding, we strengthened useful traits in plants and animals.
64720	69760	We became very good at this, but never truly understood how it works, until we discovered
69760	74360	the code of life, deoxyribonucleic acid, DNA.
74360	78720	A complex molecule that guides the growth, development, function, and reproduction of
78720	80680	everything alive.
80680	83920	Information is encoded in the structure of the molecule.
83920	88860	Four nucleotides are paired and make up a code that carries instructions.
88860	92800	Change the instructions, and you change the being carrying it.
92800	96560	As soon as DNA was discovered, people tried to tinker with it.
96560	101760	In the 1960s, scientists bombarded plants with radiation to cause random mutations in
101760	103360	the genetic code.
103360	107300	The idea was to get a useful plant variation by pure chance.
107300	109940	Sometimes it actually worked, too.
109940	115220	In the 70s, scientists inserted DNA snippets into bacteria, plants, and animals to study
115220	120560	and modify them, for research, medicine, agriculture, and for fun.
120560	126000	The earliest genetically modified animal was born in 1974, making mice a standard tool
126000	128720	for research, saving millions of lives.
128720	131400	In the 80s, we got commercial.
131400	135240	The first patent was given for a microbe engineered to absorb oil.
135240	140320	Today, we produce many chemicals by means of engineered life, like life-saving clotting
140320	144880	factors, growth hormones, and insulin, all things we had to harvest from the organs of
144880	146700	animals before that.
146700	152600	The first food modified in the lab went on sale in 1994, the flavor-saver tomato, a tomato
152600	157200	given a much longer shelf life via an extra gene that suppressed the buildup of a rotting
157200	158840	enzyme.
158840	164040	But GM food and the controversy surrounding them deserve a video of their own.
164040	168080	In the 1990s, there was also a brief foray into human engineering.
168080	172060	To treat maternal infertility, babies were made that carried genetic information from
172060	177920	three humans, making them the first humans ever to have three genetic parents.
178240	184800	Today, there are super muscled pigs, fast-growing salmon, featherless chickens, and see-through frogs.
184800	187560	On the fun side, we made things glow in the dark.
187560	191760	Fluorescent zebrafish are available for as little as $10.
191760	196600	All of this is already very impressive, but until recently, gene editing was extremely
196600	200460	expensive, complicated, and took a long time to do.
200460	207360	This has now changed with a revolutionary new technology now entering the stage, CRISPR.
207360	211520	Tonight, the costs of engineering have shrunk by 99%.
211520	216060	Instead of a year, it takes a few weeks to conduct experiments, and basically everybody
216060	218540	with a lab can do it.
218540	222400	It's hard to get across how big a technical revolution CRISPR is.
222400	226400	It literally has the potential to change humanity forever.
226400	230600	Why did this sudden revolution happen, and how does it work?
230600	239380	Bacteria and viruses have been fighting since the dawn of life.
239380	243180	So-called bacteriophages, or phages, hunt bacteria.
243180	247680	In the ocean, phages kill 40% of them every single day.
247680	251840	Phages do this by inserting their own genetic code into the bacteria and taking them over
251840	253660	to use them as factories.
253660	257800	The bacteria try to resist, but fail most of the time because their protection tools
257800	259560	are too weak.
259560	262600	But sometimes, bacteria survive an attack.
262600	267960	Only if they do so, can they activate their most effective antivirus system.
267960	273040	They save a part of the virus' DNA in their own genetic code, in a DNA archive called
273040	274040	CRISPR.
274040	277720	Here, it's stored safely until it's needed.
277720	283000	When the virus attacks again, the bacterium quickly makes an RNA copy from the DNA archive
283000	287480	and arms a secret weapon, a protein called Cas9.
287480	292800	The protein now scans the bacterium's insides for signs of the virus invader by comparing
292800	296920	every bit of DNA it finds to the sample from the archive.
296920	302520	When it finds a 100% perfect match, it's activated and cuts out the virus' DNA, making
302520	306160	it useless, protecting the bacterium against the attack.
306160	312260	What's special is that Cas9 is very precise, almost like a DNA surgeon.
312260	317800	The revolution began when scientists figured out that the CRISPR system is programmable.
317800	322420	You can just give it a copy of DNA you want to modify and put the system into a living
322420	323420	cell.
323420	328860	If the old techniques of genetic manipulation were like a map, CRISPR is like a GPS system.
328860	334500	Aside from being precise, cheap, and easy, CRISPR offers the ability to edit live cells,
334500	339440	to switch genes on and off, and target and study particular DNA sequences.
339440	346000	It also works for every type of cell, microorganisms, plants, animals, or humans.
346000	351760	But despite the revolution CRISPR is for science, it's still just a first-generation tool.
351760	360120	More precise tools are already being created and used as we speak.
360120	365560	In 2015, scientists used CRISPR to cut the HIV virus out of living cells from patients
365560	368520	in the lab, proving that it was possible.
368520	372280	Only about a year later, they carried out a larger-scale project with rats that had
372280	375860	the HIV virus in basically all of their body cells.
375860	379840	By simply injecting CRISPR into the rats' tails, they were able to remove more than
379840	383160	50% of the virus from cells all over the body.
383160	387520	In a few decades, a CRISPR therapy might cure HIV.
387520	392860	And other retroviruses, viruses that hide inside human DNA like herpes, could be eradicated
392860	395160	this way.
395160	399400	CRISPR could also defeat one of our worst enemies, cancer.
399400	403620	Cancer occurs when cells refuse to die and keep multiplying while concealing themselves
403620	405520	from the immune system.
405520	410480	CRISPR gives us the means to edit your immune cells and make them better cancer hunters.
410480	414320	Getting rid of cancer might eventually mean getting just a couple of injections of a few
414320	419640	thousand of your own cells that have been engineered in the lab to heal you for good.
419640	423780	The first clinical trial for a CRISPR cancer treatment on human patients was approved in
423780	426340	early 2016 in the US.
426340	430100	Not even a month later, Chinese scientists announced that they would treat lung cancer
430100	434420	patients with immune cells modified with CRISPR in August 2016.
434420	437060	Things are picking up pace quickly.
437060	439500	And then there are genetic diseases.
439500	444700	There are thousands of them, and they range from mildly annoying to deadly or entail decades
444700	445860	of suffering.
445860	450320	With a powerful tool like CRISPR, we may be able to end this.
450320	456320	The 3,000 genetic diseases are caused by a single incorrect letter in your DNA.
456320	460880	We are already building a modified version of Cas9 that is made to change just a single
460880	463880	letter fixing the disease in the cell.
463880	468580	In a decade or two, we could possibly cure thousands of diseases forever.
468580	472100	But all of these medical applications have one thing in common.
472100	477100	They are limited to the individual and die with them, except if you use them on reproductive
477100	479720	cells or very early embryos.
479720	483380	But CRISPR can and probably will be used for much more.
483380	489240	The creation of modified humans, designer babies, and will mean gradual but irreversible
489240	497080	changes to the human gene pool.
497080	502640	The means to edit the genome of a human embryo already exist, though the technology is still
502640	504160	in its early stages.
504160	506480	But it has already been attempted twice.
507240	513840	In 2015 and 2016, Chinese scientists experimented with human embryos and were partially successful
513840	515680	on their second attempt.
515680	520040	They showed the enormous challenges we still face in gene editing embryos, but also that
520040	522920	scientists are working on solving them.
522920	525420	This is like the computer in the 70s.
525420	528400	There will be better computers.
528400	533820	Regardless of your personal take on genetic engineering, it will affect you.
533820	537460	Designed humans could alter the genome of our entire species because their engineered
537460	541500	traits will be passed on to their children and could spread over generations, slowly
541500	544700	modifying the whole gene pool of humanity.
544700	546300	It will start slowly.
546300	549280	The first designer babies will not be overly designed.
549280	553140	It's most likely that they will be created to eliminate a deadly genetic disease running
553140	554540	in a family.
554540	558900	As the technology progresses and gets more refined, more and more people may argue that
558900	564220	not using genetic modification is unethical, because it condemns children to preventable
564220	567880	suffering and death and denies them the cure.
567880	572580	But as soon as the first engineered kid is born, a door is opened that can't be closed
572580	573860	anymore.
573860	578660	Early on, vanity traits will mostly be left alone, but as genetic modification becomes
578660	584680	more accepted and our knowledge of our genetic code enhances, the temptation will grow.
584680	590720	If you make your offspring immune to Alzheimer, why not also give them an enhanced metabolism?
590720	593040	Why not throw in perfect eyesight?
593040	595800	How about height or muscular structure?
595800	596920	Full hair?
596920	600780	How about giving your child the gift of extraordinary intelligence?
600780	605880	Huge changes are made as a result of the personal decisions of millions of individuals that
605880	607000	accumulate.
607000	609480	This is a slippery slope.
609480	612280	Modified humans could become the new standard.
612280	616600	But as engineering becomes more normal and our knowledge improves, we could solve the
616600	620360	single biggest mortality risk factor – aging.
620360	626000	Two-thirds of the 150,000 people who die today will die of age-related causes.
626000	630520	Currently, we think aging is caused by the accumulation of damage to our cells, like
630520	635900	DNA breaks and the systems responsible for fixing those wearing off over time.
635900	638880	But there are also genes that directly affect aging.
638880	643760	A combination of genetic engineering and other therapy could stop or slow down aging,
643760	646280	maybe even reverse it.
646280	649760	We know from nature that there are animals immune to aging.
649760	653920	Maybe we could even borrow a few genes for ourselves.
653920	658420	Some scientists even think biological aging could be something that eventually just stops
658420	659960	being a thing.
659960	665140	We would still die at some point, but instead of doing so in hospitals at age 90, we might
665140	668880	be able to spend a few thousand years with our loved ones.
668880	672400	Research into this is in its infancy.
672400	676460	And many scientists are rightly skeptical about the end of aging.
676460	681100	The challenges are enormous, and maybe it is unachievable.
681100	685240	But it is conceivable that people alive today might be the first to profit from effective
685240	687360	anti-aging therapy.
687360	691040	All we might need is for someone to convince a smart billionaire to make it their next
691040	693040	problem to solve.
693040	698300	On a bigger scale, we certainly could solve many problems by having a modified population.
698300	701820	Engineered humans might be better equipped to cope with high-energy food, eliminating
701820	705140	many diseases of civilization like obesity.
705140	709660	In possession of a modified immune system, with a library of potential threats, we might
709660	713440	become immune to most diseases that haunt us today.
713440	718740	Even further into the future, we could engineer humans to be equipped for extended space travel
718740	724240	and to cope with different conditions on other planets, which would be extremely helpful
724240	731860	in keeping us alive in our hostile universe.
731860	737900	Still a few major challenges await us, some technological, some ethical.
737900	741800	Many of you watching will feel uncomfortable and fear that we will create a world in which
741800	747100	we will reject non-perfect humans and pre-select features and qualities based on our idea of
747100	748460	what's healthy.
748460	751700	The thing is, we are already living in this world.
751700	756500	Tests for dozens of genetic diseases or complications have become standard for pregnant women in
756500	759020	much of the world.
759020	764780	Often the mere suspicion of a genetic defect can lead to the end of a pregnancy.
764780	769100	Take Down syndrome, for example, one of the most common genetic defects.
769100	774400	In Europe, about 92% of all pregnancies where it's detected are terminated.
774400	778720	The decision to terminate a pregnancy is incredibly personal, but it's important to acknowledge
778720	783300	the reality that we are pre-selecting humans based on medical conditions.
783300	788340	There is also no use in pretending this will change, so we have to act carefully and respectfully
788340	792840	as we advance the technology and can make more and more selections.
792840	795360	But none of this will happen soon.
795360	800240	As powerful as CRISPR is, and it is, it's not infallible yet.
800480	804960	Wrong edits still happen, as well as unknown errors that could occur anywhere in the DNA
804960	806920	and might go unnoticed.
806920	812140	The gene edit might achieve the desired result, disabling a disease, but also might accidentally
812140	814360	trigger unwanted changes.
814360	818920	We just don't know enough yet about the complex interplay of our genes to avoid unpredictable
818920	821040	consequences.
821040	825760	Working on accuracy and monitoring methods is a major concern as the first human trials
825760	826940	begin.
826940	832320	And since we've discussed a possible positive future, there are darker visions too.
832320	837340	Imagine what a state like North Korea could do if they embraced genetic engineering.
837340	842960	Could a state cement its rule forever by forcing gene editing on their subjects?
842960	848180	What would stop a totalitarian regime from engineering an army of modified super soldiers?
848180	850500	It is doable in theory.
850500	855340	Scenarios like this one are far, far off into the future, if they ever become possible at
855340	856340	all.
856340	860720	No basic proof of concept for genetic engineering like this already exists today.
860720	863620	The technology really is that powerful.
863620	868080	While this might be a tempting reason to ban genetic editing and related research, that
868080	870620	would certainly be a mistake.
870620	874660	Banning human genetic engineering would only lead to the science wandering off to a place
874660	878800	with jurisdiction and rules that we're uncomfortable with.
878800	883940	Only by participating can we make sure that further research is guided by caution, reason,
883940	890140	oversight and transparency.
890140	892500	Do you feel uncomfortable now?
892500	894600	Most of us have something wrong with them.
894600	899440	In the future that lies ahead of us, would we have been allowed to exist?
899440	904360	The technology is certainly a bit scary, but we have a lot to gain and genetic engineering
904360	909700	might just be a step in the natural evolution of intelligent species in the universe.
909700	911860	We might end disease.
911860	916380	We could extend our life expectancy by centuries and travel to the stars.
916380	920300	There's no need to think small when it comes to this topic.
920300	925380	Whatever your opinion on genetic engineering, the future is approaching no matter what.
925380	931180	What has been insane science fiction is about to become our new reality, a reality full
931180	938860	of opportunities and challenges.
938860	942800	Things like this would not be possible without viewer donations on patreon.com.
