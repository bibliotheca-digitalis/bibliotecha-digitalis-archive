WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:05.880
Imagine you were alive back in the 1980s, and were told that computers would soon take

00:05.880 --> 00:10.820
over everything, from shopping, to dating, and the stock market.

00:10.820 --> 00:14.640
That billions of people would be connected via a kind of web.

00:14.640 --> 00:20.080
That you would own a handheld device, orders of magnitude more powerful than supercomputers.

00:20.080 --> 00:24.080
It would seem absurd, but then all of it happened.

00:24.080 --> 00:28.440
Science fiction became our reality, and we don't even think about it.

00:28.440 --> 00:31.780
We're at a similar point today with genetic engineering.

00:31.780 --> 00:33.920
So let's talk about it.

00:33.920 --> 00:38.480
Where it came from, what we're doing right now, and about a recent breakthrough that

00:38.480 --> 00:43.120
will change how we live and what we perceive as normal forever.

00:43.120 --> 01:00.120
Humans have been engineering life for thousands of years.

01:00.120 --> 01:04.720
Through selective breeding, we strengthened useful traits in plants and animals.

01:04.720 --> 01:09.760
We became very good at this, but never truly understood how it works, until we discovered

01:09.760 --> 01:14.360
the code of life, deoxyribonucleic acid, DNA.

01:14.360 --> 01:18.720
A complex molecule that guides the growth, development, function, and reproduction of

01:18.720 --> 01:20.680
everything alive.

01:20.680 --> 01:23.920
Information is encoded in the structure of the molecule.

01:23.920 --> 01:28.860
Four nucleotides are paired and make up a code that carries instructions.

01:28.860 --> 01:32.800
Change the instructions, and you change the being carrying it.

01:32.800 --> 01:36.560
As soon as DNA was discovered, people tried to tinker with it.

01:36.560 --> 01:41.760
In the 1960s, scientists bombarded plants with radiation to cause random mutations in

01:41.760 --> 01:43.360
the genetic code.

01:43.360 --> 01:47.300
The idea was to get a useful plant variation by pure chance.

01:47.300 --> 01:49.940
Sometimes it actually worked, too.

01:49.940 --> 01:55.220
In the 70s, scientists inserted DNA snippets into bacteria, plants, and animals to study

01:55.220 --> 02:00.560
and modify them, for research, medicine, agriculture, and for fun.

02:00.560 --> 02:06.000
The earliest genetically modified animal was born in 1974, making mice a standard tool

02:06.000 --> 02:08.720
for research, saving millions of lives.

02:08.720 --> 02:11.400
In the 80s, we got commercial.

02:11.400 --> 02:15.240
The first patent was given for a microbe engineered to absorb oil.

02:15.240 --> 02:20.320
Today, we produce many chemicals by means of engineered life, like life-saving clotting

02:20.320 --> 02:24.880
factors, growth hormones, and insulin, all things we had to harvest from the organs of

02:24.880 --> 02:26.700
animals before that.

02:26.700 --> 02:32.600
The first food modified in the lab went on sale in 1994, the flavor-saver tomato, a tomato

02:32.600 --> 02:37.200
given a much longer shelf life via an extra gene that suppressed the buildup of a rotting

02:37.200 --> 02:38.840
enzyme.

02:38.840 --> 02:44.040
But GM food and the controversy surrounding them deserve a video of their own.

02:44.040 --> 02:48.080
In the 1990s, there was also a brief foray into human engineering.

02:48.080 --> 02:52.060
To treat maternal infertility, babies were made that carried genetic information from

02:52.060 --> 02:57.920
three humans, making them the first humans ever to have three genetic parents.

02:58.240 --> 03:04.800
Today, there are super muscled pigs, fast-growing salmon, featherless chickens, and see-through frogs.

03:04.800 --> 03:07.560
On the fun side, we made things glow in the dark.

03:07.560 --> 03:11.760
Fluorescent zebrafish are available for as little as $10.

03:11.760 --> 03:16.600
All of this is already very impressive, but until recently, gene editing was extremely

03:16.600 --> 03:20.460
expensive, complicated, and took a long time to do.

03:20.460 --> 03:27.360
This has now changed with a revolutionary new technology now entering the stage, CRISPR.

03:27.360 --> 03:31.520
Tonight, the costs of engineering have shrunk by 99%.

03:31.520 --> 03:36.060
Instead of a year, it takes a few weeks to conduct experiments, and basically everybody

03:36.060 --> 03:38.540
with a lab can do it.

03:38.540 --> 03:42.400
It's hard to get across how big a technical revolution CRISPR is.

03:42.400 --> 03:46.400
It literally has the potential to change humanity forever.

03:46.400 --> 03:50.600
Why did this sudden revolution happen, and how does it work?

03:50.600 --> 03:59.380
Bacteria and viruses have been fighting since the dawn of life.

03:59.380 --> 04:03.180
So-called bacteriophages, or phages, hunt bacteria.

04:03.180 --> 04:07.680
In the ocean, phages kill 40% of them every single day.

04:07.680 --> 04:11.840
Phages do this by inserting their own genetic code into the bacteria and taking them over

04:11.840 --> 04:13.660
to use them as factories.

04:13.660 --> 04:17.800
The bacteria try to resist, but fail most of the time because their protection tools

04:17.800 --> 04:19.560
are too weak.

04:19.560 --> 04:22.600
But sometimes, bacteria survive an attack.

04:22.600 --> 04:27.960
Only if they do so, can they activate their most effective antivirus system.

04:27.960 --> 04:33.040
They save a part of the virus' DNA in their own genetic code, in a DNA archive called

04:33.040 --> 04:34.040
CRISPR.

04:34.040 --> 04:37.720
Here, it's stored safely until it's needed.

04:37.720 --> 04:43.000
When the virus attacks again, the bacterium quickly makes an RNA copy from the DNA archive

04:43.000 --> 04:47.480
and arms a secret weapon, a protein called Cas9.

04:47.480 --> 04:52.800
The protein now scans the bacterium's insides for signs of the virus invader by comparing

04:52.800 --> 04:56.920
every bit of DNA it finds to the sample from the archive.

04:56.920 --> 05:02.520
When it finds a 100% perfect match, it's activated and cuts out the virus' DNA, making

05:02.520 --> 05:06.160
it useless, protecting the bacterium against the attack.

05:06.160 --> 05:12.260
What's special is that Cas9 is very precise, almost like a DNA surgeon.

05:12.260 --> 05:17.800
The revolution began when scientists figured out that the CRISPR system is programmable.

05:17.800 --> 05:22.420
You can just give it a copy of DNA you want to modify and put the system into a living

05:22.420 --> 05:23.420
cell.

05:23.420 --> 05:28.860
If the old techniques of genetic manipulation were like a map, CRISPR is like a GPS system.

05:28.860 --> 05:34.500
Aside from being precise, cheap, and easy, CRISPR offers the ability to edit live cells,

05:34.500 --> 05:39.440
to switch genes on and off, and target and study particular DNA sequences.

05:39.440 --> 05:46.000
It also works for every type of cell, microorganisms, plants, animals, or humans.

05:46.000 --> 05:51.760
But despite the revolution CRISPR is for science, it's still just a first-generation tool.

05:51.760 --> 06:00.120
More precise tools are already being created and used as we speak.

06:00.120 --> 06:05.560
In 2015, scientists used CRISPR to cut the HIV virus out of living cells from patients

06:05.560 --> 06:08.520
in the lab, proving that it was possible.

06:08.520 --> 06:12.280
Only about a year later, they carried out a larger-scale project with rats that had

06:12.280 --> 06:15.860
the HIV virus in basically all of their body cells.

06:15.860 --> 06:19.840
By simply injecting CRISPR into the rats' tails, they were able to remove more than

06:19.840 --> 06:23.160
50% of the virus from cells all over the body.

06:23.160 --> 06:27.520
In a few decades, a CRISPR therapy might cure HIV.

06:27.520 --> 06:32.860
And other retroviruses, viruses that hide inside human DNA like herpes, could be eradicated

06:32.860 --> 06:35.160
this way.

06:35.160 --> 06:39.400
CRISPR could also defeat one of our worst enemies, cancer.

06:39.400 --> 06:43.620
Cancer occurs when cells refuse to die and keep multiplying while concealing themselves

06:43.620 --> 06:45.520
from the immune system.

06:45.520 --> 06:50.480
CRISPR gives us the means to edit your immune cells and make them better cancer hunters.

06:50.480 --> 06:54.320
Getting rid of cancer might eventually mean getting just a couple of injections of a few

06:54.320 --> 06:59.640
thousand of your own cells that have been engineered in the lab to heal you for good.

06:59.640 --> 07:03.780
The first clinical trial for a CRISPR cancer treatment on human patients was approved in

07:03.780 --> 07:06.340
early 2016 in the US.

07:06.340 --> 07:10.100
Not even a month later, Chinese scientists announced that they would treat lung cancer

07:10.100 --> 07:14.420
patients with immune cells modified with CRISPR in August 2016.

07:14.420 --> 07:17.060
Things are picking up pace quickly.

07:17.060 --> 07:19.500
And then there are genetic diseases.

07:19.500 --> 07:24.700
There are thousands of them, and they range from mildly annoying to deadly or entail decades

07:24.700 --> 07:25.860
of suffering.

07:25.860 --> 07:30.320
With a powerful tool like CRISPR, we may be able to end this.

07:30.320 --> 07:36.320
The 3,000 genetic diseases are caused by a single incorrect letter in your DNA.

07:36.320 --> 07:40.880
We are already building a modified version of Cas9 that is made to change just a single

07:40.880 --> 07:43.880
letter fixing the disease in the cell.

07:43.880 --> 07:48.580
In a decade or two, we could possibly cure thousands of diseases forever.

07:48.580 --> 07:52.100
But all of these medical applications have one thing in common.

07:52.100 --> 07:57.100
They are limited to the individual and die with them, except if you use them on reproductive

07:57.100 --> 07:59.720
cells or very early embryos.

07:59.720 --> 08:03.380
But CRISPR can and probably will be used for much more.

08:03.380 --> 08:09.240
The creation of modified humans, designer babies, and will mean gradual but irreversible

08:09.240 --> 08:17.080
changes to the human gene pool.

08:17.080 --> 08:22.640
The means to edit the genome of a human embryo already exist, though the technology is still

08:22.640 --> 08:24.160
in its early stages.

08:24.160 --> 08:26.480
But it has already been attempted twice.

08:27.240 --> 08:33.840
In 2015 and 2016, Chinese scientists experimented with human embryos and were partially successful

08:33.840 --> 08:35.680
on their second attempt.

08:35.680 --> 08:40.040
They showed the enormous challenges we still face in gene editing embryos, but also that

08:40.040 --> 08:42.920
scientists are working on solving them.

08:42.920 --> 08:45.420
This is like the computer in the 70s.

08:45.420 --> 08:48.400
There will be better computers.

08:48.400 --> 08:53.820
Regardless of your personal take on genetic engineering, it will affect you.

08:53.820 --> 08:57.460
Designed humans could alter the genome of our entire species because their engineered

08:57.460 --> 09:01.500
traits will be passed on to their children and could spread over generations, slowly

09:01.500 --> 09:04.700
modifying the whole gene pool of humanity.

09:04.700 --> 09:06.300
It will start slowly.

09:06.300 --> 09:09.280
The first designer babies will not be overly designed.

09:09.280 --> 09:13.140
It's most likely that they will be created to eliminate a deadly genetic disease running

09:13.140 --> 09:14.540
in a family.

09:14.540 --> 09:18.900
As the technology progresses and gets more refined, more and more people may argue that

09:18.900 --> 09:24.220
not using genetic modification is unethical, because it condemns children to preventable

09:24.220 --> 09:27.880
suffering and death and denies them the cure.

09:27.880 --> 09:32.580
But as soon as the first engineered kid is born, a door is opened that can't be closed

09:32.580 --> 09:33.860
anymore.

09:33.860 --> 09:38.660
Early on, vanity traits will mostly be left alone, but as genetic modification becomes

09:38.660 --> 09:44.680
more accepted and our knowledge of our genetic code enhances, the temptation will grow.

09:44.680 --> 09:50.720
If you make your offspring immune to Alzheimer, why not also give them an enhanced metabolism?

09:50.720 --> 09:53.040
Why not throw in perfect eyesight?

09:53.040 --> 09:55.800
How about height or muscular structure?

09:55.800 --> 09:56.920
Full hair?

09:56.920 --> 10:00.780
How about giving your child the gift of extraordinary intelligence?

10:00.780 --> 10:05.880
Huge changes are made as a result of the personal decisions of millions of individuals that

10:05.880 --> 10:07.000
accumulate.

10:07.000 --> 10:09.480
This is a slippery slope.

10:09.480 --> 10:12.280
Modified humans could become the new standard.

10:12.280 --> 10:16.600
But as engineering becomes more normal and our knowledge improves, we could solve the

10:16.600 --> 10:20.360
single biggest mortality risk factor – aging.

10:20.360 --> 10:26.000
Two-thirds of the 150,000 people who die today will die of age-related causes.

10:26.000 --> 10:30.520
Currently, we think aging is caused by the accumulation of damage to our cells, like

10:30.520 --> 10:35.900
DNA breaks and the systems responsible for fixing those wearing off over time.

10:35.900 --> 10:38.880
But there are also genes that directly affect aging.

10:38.880 --> 10:43.760
A combination of genetic engineering and other therapy could stop or slow down aging,

10:43.760 --> 10:46.280
maybe even reverse it.

10:46.280 --> 10:49.760
We know from nature that there are animals immune to aging.

10:49.760 --> 10:53.920
Maybe we could even borrow a few genes for ourselves.

10:53.920 --> 10:58.420
Some scientists even think biological aging could be something that eventually just stops

10:58.420 --> 10:59.960
being a thing.

10:59.960 --> 11:05.140
We would still die at some point, but instead of doing so in hospitals at age 90, we might

11:05.140 --> 11:08.880
be able to spend a few thousand years with our loved ones.

11:08.880 --> 11:12.400
Research into this is in its infancy.

11:12.400 --> 11:16.460
And many scientists are rightly skeptical about the end of aging.

11:16.460 --> 11:21.100
The challenges are enormous, and maybe it is unachievable.

11:21.100 --> 11:25.240
But it is conceivable that people alive today might be the first to profit from effective

11:25.240 --> 11:27.360
anti-aging therapy.

11:27.360 --> 11:31.040
All we might need is for someone to convince a smart billionaire to make it their next

11:31.040 --> 11:33.040
problem to solve.

11:33.040 --> 11:38.300
On a bigger scale, we certainly could solve many problems by having a modified population.

11:38.300 --> 11:41.820
Engineered humans might be better equipped to cope with high-energy food, eliminating

11:41.820 --> 11:45.140
many diseases of civilization like obesity.

11:45.140 --> 11:49.660
In possession of a modified immune system, with a library of potential threats, we might

11:49.660 --> 11:53.440
become immune to most diseases that haunt us today.

11:53.440 --> 11:58.740
Even further into the future, we could engineer humans to be equipped for extended space travel

11:58.740 --> 12:04.240
and to cope with different conditions on other planets, which would be extremely helpful

12:04.240 --> 12:11.860
in keeping us alive in our hostile universe.

12:11.860 --> 12:17.900
Still a few major challenges await us, some technological, some ethical.

12:17.900 --> 12:21.800
Many of you watching will feel uncomfortable and fear that we will create a world in which

12:21.800 --> 12:27.100
we will reject non-perfect humans and pre-select features and qualities based on our idea of

12:27.100 --> 12:28.460
what's healthy.

12:28.460 --> 12:31.700
The thing is, we are already living in this world.

12:31.700 --> 12:36.500
Tests for dozens of genetic diseases or complications have become standard for pregnant women in

12:36.500 --> 12:39.020
much of the world.

12:39.020 --> 12:44.780
Often the mere suspicion of a genetic defect can lead to the end of a pregnancy.

12:44.780 --> 12:49.100
Take Down syndrome, for example, one of the most common genetic defects.

12:49.100 --> 12:54.400
In Europe, about 92% of all pregnancies where it's detected are terminated.

12:54.400 --> 12:58.720
The decision to terminate a pregnancy is incredibly personal, but it's important to acknowledge

12:58.720 --> 13:03.300
the reality that we are pre-selecting humans based on medical conditions.

13:03.300 --> 13:08.340
There is also no use in pretending this will change, so we have to act carefully and respectfully

13:08.340 --> 13:12.840
as we advance the technology and can make more and more selections.

13:12.840 --> 13:15.360
But none of this will happen soon.

13:15.360 --> 13:20.240
As powerful as CRISPR is, and it is, it's not infallible yet.

13:20.480 --> 13:24.960
Wrong edits still happen, as well as unknown errors that could occur anywhere in the DNA

13:24.960 --> 13:26.920
and might go unnoticed.

13:26.920 --> 13:32.140
The gene edit might achieve the desired result, disabling a disease, but also might accidentally

13:32.140 --> 13:34.360
trigger unwanted changes.

13:34.360 --> 13:38.920
We just don't know enough yet about the complex interplay of our genes to avoid unpredictable

13:38.920 --> 13:41.040
consequences.

13:41.040 --> 13:45.760
Working on accuracy and monitoring methods is a major concern as the first human trials

13:45.760 --> 13:46.940
begin.

13:46.940 --> 13:52.320
And since we've discussed a possible positive future, there are darker visions too.

13:52.320 --> 13:57.340
Imagine what a state like North Korea could do if they embraced genetic engineering.

13:57.340 --> 14:02.960
Could a state cement its rule forever by forcing gene editing on their subjects?

14:02.960 --> 14:08.180
What would stop a totalitarian regime from engineering an army of modified super soldiers?

14:08.180 --> 14:10.500
It is doable in theory.

14:10.500 --> 14:15.340
Scenarios like this one are far, far off into the future, if they ever become possible at

14:15.340 --> 14:16.340
all.

14:16.340 --> 14:20.720
No basic proof of concept for genetic engineering like this already exists today.

14:20.720 --> 14:23.620
The technology really is that powerful.

14:23.620 --> 14:28.080
While this might be a tempting reason to ban genetic editing and related research, that

14:28.080 --> 14:30.620
would certainly be a mistake.

14:30.620 --> 14:34.660
Banning human genetic engineering would only lead to the science wandering off to a place

14:34.660 --> 14:38.800
with jurisdiction and rules that we're uncomfortable with.

14:38.800 --> 14:43.940
Only by participating can we make sure that further research is guided by caution, reason,

14:43.940 --> 14:50.140
oversight and transparency.

14:50.140 --> 14:52.500
Do you feel uncomfortable now?

14:52.500 --> 14:54.600
Most of us have something wrong with them.

14:54.600 --> 14:59.440
In the future that lies ahead of us, would we have been allowed to exist?

14:59.440 --> 15:04.360
The technology is certainly a bit scary, but we have a lot to gain and genetic engineering

15:04.360 --> 15:09.700
might just be a step in the natural evolution of intelligent species in the universe.

15:09.700 --> 15:11.860
We might end disease.

15:11.860 --> 15:16.380
We could extend our life expectancy by centuries and travel to the stars.

15:16.380 --> 15:20.300
There's no need to think small when it comes to this topic.

15:20.300 --> 15:25.380
Whatever your opinion on genetic engineering, the future is approaching no matter what.

15:25.380 --> 15:31.180
What has been insane science fiction is about to become our new reality, a reality full

15:31.180 --> 15:38.860
of opportunities and challenges.

15:38.860 --> 15:42.800
