1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,880
Imagine you were alive back in the 1980s, and were told that computers would soon take

2
00:00:05,880 --> 00:00:10,820
over everything, from shopping, to dating, and the stock market.

3
00:00:10,820 --> 00:00:14,640
That billions of people would be connected via a kind of web.

4
00:00:14,640 --> 00:00:20,080
That you would own a handheld device, orders of magnitude more powerful than supercomputers.

5
00:00:20,080 --> 00:00:24,080
It would seem absurd, but then all of it happened.

6
00:00:24,080 --> 00:00:28,440
Science fiction became our reality, and we don't even think about it.

7
00:00:28,440 --> 00:00:31,780
We're at a similar point today with genetic engineering.

8
00:00:31,780 --> 00:00:33,920
So let's talk about it.

9
00:00:33,920 --> 00:00:38,480
Where it came from, what we're doing right now, and about a recent breakthrough that

10
00:00:38,480 --> 00:00:43,120
will change how we live and what we perceive as normal forever.

11
00:00:43,120 --> 00:01:00,120
Humans have been engineering life for thousands of years.

12
00:01:00,120 --> 00:01:04,720
Through selective breeding, we strengthened useful traits in plants and animals.

13
00:01:04,720 --> 00:01:09,760
We became very good at this, but never truly understood how it works, until we discovered

14
00:01:09,760 --> 00:01:14,360
the code of life, deoxyribonucleic acid, DNA.

15
00:01:14,360 --> 00:01:18,720
A complex molecule that guides the growth, development, function, and reproduction of

16
00:01:18,720 --> 00:01:20,680
everything alive.

17
00:01:20,680 --> 00:01:23,920
Information is encoded in the structure of the molecule.

18
00:01:23,920 --> 00:01:28,860
Four nucleotides are paired and make up a code that carries instructions.

19
00:01:28,860 --> 00:01:32,800
Change the instructions, and you change the being carrying it.

20
00:01:32,800 --> 00:01:36,560
As soon as DNA was discovered, people tried to tinker with it.

21
00:01:36,560 --> 00:01:41,760
In the 1960s, scientists bombarded plants with radiation to cause random mutations in

22
00:01:41,760 --> 00:01:43,360
the genetic code.

23
00:01:43,360 --> 00:01:47,300
The idea was to get a useful plant variation by pure chance.

24
00:01:47,300 --> 00:01:49,940
Sometimes it actually worked, too.

25
00:01:49,940 --> 00:01:55,220
In the 70s, scientists inserted DNA snippets into bacteria, plants, and animals to study

26
00:01:55,220 --> 00:02:00,560
and modify them, for research, medicine, agriculture, and for fun.

27
00:02:00,560 --> 00:02:06,000
The earliest genetically modified animal was born in 1974, making mice a standard tool

28
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,720
for research, saving millions of lives.

29
00:02:08,720 --> 00:02:11,400
In the 80s, we got commercial.

30
00:02:11,400 --> 00:02:15,240
The first patent was given for a microbe engineered to absorb oil.

31
00:02:15,240 --> 00:02:20,320
Today, we produce many chemicals by means of engineered life, like life-saving clotting

32
00:02:20,320 --> 00:02:24,880
factors, growth hormones, and insulin, all things we had to harvest from the organs of

33
00:02:24,880 --> 00:02:26,700
animals before that.

34
00:02:26,700 --> 00:02:32,600
The first food modified in the lab went on sale in 1994, the flavor-saver tomato, a tomato

35
00:02:32,600 --> 00:02:37,200
given a much longer shelf life via an extra gene that suppressed the buildup of a rotting

36
00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:38,840
enzyme.

37
00:02:38,840 --> 00:02:44,040
But GM food and the controversy surrounding them deserve a video of their own.

38
00:02:44,040 --> 00:02:48,080
In the 1990s, there was also a brief foray into human engineering.

39
00:02:48,080 --> 00:02:52,060
To treat maternal infertility, babies were made that carried genetic information from

40
00:02:52,060 --> 00:02:57,920
three humans, making them the first humans ever to have three genetic parents.

41
00:02:58,240 --> 00:03:04,800
Today, there are super muscled pigs, fast-growing salmon, featherless chickens, and see-through frogs.

42
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:07,560
On the fun side, we made things glow in the dark.

43
00:03:07,560 --> 00:03:11,760
Fluorescent zebrafish are available for as little as $10.

44
00:03:11,760 --> 00:03:16,600
All of this is already very impressive, but until recently, gene editing was extremely

45
00:03:16,600 --> 00:03:20,460
expensive, complicated, and took a long time to do.

46
00:03:20,460 --> 00:03:27,360
This has now changed with a revolutionary new technology now entering the stage, CRISPR.

47
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:31,520
Tonight, the costs of engineering have shrunk by 99%.

48
00:03:31,520 --> 00:03:36,060
Instead of a year, it takes a few weeks to conduct experiments, and basically everybody

49
00:03:36,060 --> 00:03:38,540
with a lab can do it.

50
00:03:38,540 --> 00:03:42,400
It's hard to get across how big a technical revolution CRISPR is.

51
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:46,400
It literally has the potential to change humanity forever.

52
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:50,600
Why did this sudden revolution happen, and how does it work?

53
00:03:50,600 --> 00:03:59,380
Bacteria and viruses have been fighting since the dawn of life.

54
00:03:59,380 --> 00:04:03,180
So-called bacteriophages, or phages, hunt bacteria.

55
00:04:03,180 --> 00:04:07,680
In the ocean, phages kill 40% of them every single day.

56
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:11,840
Phages do this by inserting their own genetic code into the bacteria and taking them over

57
00:04:11,840 --> 00:04:13,660
to use them as factories.

58
00:04:13,660 --> 00:04:17,800
The bacteria try to resist, but fail most of the time because their protection tools

59
00:04:17,800 --> 00:04:19,560
are too weak.

60
00:04:19,560 --> 00:04:22,600
But sometimes, bacteria survive an attack.

61
00:04:22,600 --> 00:04:27,960
Only if they do so, can they activate their most effective antivirus system.

62
00:04:27,960 --> 00:04:33,040
They save a part of the virus' DNA in their own genetic code, in a DNA archive called

63
00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:34,040
CRISPR.

64
00:04:34,040 --> 00:04:37,720
Here, it's stored safely until it's needed.

65
00:04:37,720 --> 00:04:43,000
When the virus attacks again, the bacterium quickly makes an RNA copy from the DNA archive

66
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:47,480
and arms a secret weapon, a protein called Cas9.

67
00:04:47,480 --> 00:04:52,800
The protein now scans the bacterium's insides for signs of the virus invader by comparing

68
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:56,920
every bit of DNA it finds to the sample from the archive.

69
00:04:56,920 --> 00:05:02,520
When it finds a 100% perfect match, it's activated and cuts out the virus' DNA, making

70
00:05:02,520 --> 00:05:06,160
it useless, protecting the bacterium against the attack.

71
00:05:06,160 --> 00:05:12,260
What's special is that Cas9 is very precise, almost like a DNA surgeon.

72
00:05:12,260 --> 00:05:17,800
The revolution began when scientists figured out that the CRISPR system is programmable.

73
00:05:17,800 --> 00:05:22,420
You can just give it a copy of DNA you want to modify and put the system into a living

74
00:05:22,420 --> 00:05:23,420
cell.

75
00:05:23,420 --> 00:05:28,860
If the old techniques of genetic manipulation were like a map, CRISPR is like a GPS system.

76
00:05:28,860 --> 00:05:34,500
Aside from being precise, cheap, and easy, CRISPR offers the ability to edit live cells,

77
00:05:34,500 --> 00:05:39,440
to switch genes on and off, and target and study particular DNA sequences.

78
00:05:39,440 --> 00:05:46,000
It also works for every type of cell, microorganisms, plants, animals, or humans.

79
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:51,760
But despite the revolution CRISPR is for science, it's still just a first-generation tool.

80
00:05:51,760 --> 00:06:00,120
More precise tools are already being created and used as we speak.

81
00:06:00,120 --> 00:06:05,560
In 2015, scientists used CRISPR to cut the HIV virus out of living cells from patients

82
00:06:05,560 --> 00:06:08,520
in the lab, proving that it was possible.

83
00:06:08,520 --> 00:06:12,280
Only about a year later, they carried out a larger-scale project with rats that had

84
00:06:12,280 --> 00:06:15,860
the HIV virus in basically all of their body cells.

85
00:06:15,860 --> 00:06:19,840
By simply injecting CRISPR into the rats' tails, they were able to remove more than

86
00:06:19,840 --> 00:06:23,160
50% of the virus from cells all over the body.

87
00:06:23,160 --> 00:06:27,520
In a few decades, a CRISPR therapy might cure HIV.

88
00:06:27,520 --> 00:06:32,860
And other retroviruses, viruses that hide inside human DNA like herpes, could be eradicated

89
00:06:32,860 --> 00:06:35,160
this way.

90
00:06:35,160 --> 00:06:39,400
CRISPR could also defeat one of our worst enemies, cancer.

91
00:06:39,400 --> 00:06:43,620
Cancer occurs when cells refuse to die and keep multiplying while concealing themselves

92
00:06:43,620 --> 00:06:45,520
from the immune system.

93
00:06:45,520 --> 00:06:50,480
CRISPR gives us the means to edit your immune cells and make them better cancer hunters.

94
00:06:50,480 --> 00:06:54,320
Getting rid of cancer might eventually mean getting just a couple of injections of a few

95
00:06:54,320 --> 00:06:59,640
thousand of your own cells that have been engineered in the lab to heal you for good.

96
00:06:59,640 --> 00:07:03,780
The first clinical trial for a CRISPR cancer treatment on human patients was approved in

97
00:07:03,780 --> 00:07:06,340
early 2016 in the US.

98
00:07:06,340 --> 00:07:10,100
Not even a month later, Chinese scientists announced that they would treat lung cancer

99
00:07:10,100 --> 00:07:14,420
patients with immune cells modified with CRISPR in August 2016.

100
00:07:14,420 --> 00:07:17,060
Things are picking up pace quickly.

101
00:07:17,060 --> 00:07:19,500
And then there are genetic diseases.

102
00:07:19,500 --> 00:07:24,700
There are thousands of them, and they range from mildly annoying to deadly or entail decades

103
00:07:24,700 --> 00:07:25,860
of suffering.

104
00:07:25,860 --> 00:07:30,320
With a powerful tool like CRISPR, we may be able to end this.

105
00:07:30,320 --> 00:07:36,320
The 3,000 genetic diseases are caused by a single incorrect letter in your DNA.

106
00:07:36,320 --> 00:07:40,880
We are already building a modified version of Cas9 that is made to change just a single

107
00:07:40,880 --> 00:07:43,880
letter fixing the disease in the cell.

108
00:07:43,880 --> 00:07:48,580
In a decade or two, we could possibly cure thousands of diseases forever.

109
00:07:48,580 --> 00:07:52,100
But all of these medical applications have one thing in common.

110
00:07:52,100 --> 00:07:57,100
They are limited to the individual and die with them, except if you use them on reproductive

111
00:07:57,100 --> 00:07:59,720
cells or very early embryos.

112
00:07:59,720 --> 00:08:03,380
But CRISPR can and probably will be used for much more.

113
00:08:03,380 --> 00:08:09,240
The creation of modified humans, designer babies, and will mean gradual but irreversible

114
00:08:09,240 --> 00:08:17,080
changes to the human gene pool.

115
00:08:17,080 --> 00:08:22,640
The means to edit the genome of a human embryo already exist, though the technology is still

116
00:08:22,640 --> 00:08:24,160
in its early stages.

117
00:08:24,160 --> 00:08:26,480
But it has already been attempted twice.

118
00:08:27,240 --> 00:08:33,840
In 2015 and 2016, Chinese scientists experimented with human embryos and were partially successful

119
00:08:33,840 --> 00:08:35,680
on their second attempt.

120
00:08:35,680 --> 00:08:40,040
They showed the enormous challenges we still face in gene editing embryos, but also that

121
00:08:40,040 --> 00:08:42,920
scientists are working on solving them.

122
00:08:42,920 --> 00:08:45,420
This is like the computer in the 70s.

123
00:08:45,420 --> 00:08:48,400
There will be better computers.

124
00:08:48,400 --> 00:08:53,820
Regardless of your personal take on genetic engineering, it will affect you.

125
00:08:53,820 --> 00:08:57,460
Designed humans could alter the genome of our entire species because their engineered

126
00:08:57,460 --> 00:09:01,500
traits will be passed on to their children and could spread over generations, slowly

127
00:09:01,500 --> 00:09:04,700
modifying the whole gene pool of humanity.

128
00:09:04,700 --> 00:09:06,300
It will start slowly.

129
00:09:06,300 --> 00:09:09,280
The first designer babies will not be overly designed.

130
00:09:09,280 --> 00:09:13,140
It's most likely that they will be created to eliminate a deadly genetic disease running

131
00:09:13,140 --> 00:09:14,540
in a family.

132
00:09:14,540 --> 00:09:18,900
As the technology progresses and gets more refined, more and more people may argue that

133
00:09:18,900 --> 00:09:24,220
not using genetic modification is unethical, because it condemns children to preventable

134
00:09:24,220 --> 00:09:27,880
suffering and death and denies them the cure.

135
00:09:27,880 --> 00:09:32,580
But as soon as the first engineered kid is born, a door is opened that can't be closed

136
00:09:32,580 --> 00:09:33,860
anymore.

137
00:09:33,860 --> 00:09:38,660
Early on, vanity traits will mostly be left alone, but as genetic modification becomes

138
00:09:38,660 --> 00:09:44,680
more accepted and our knowledge of our genetic code enhances, the temptation will grow.

139
00:09:44,680 --> 00:09:50,720
If you make your offspring immune to Alzheimer, why not also give them an enhanced metabolism?

140
00:09:50,720 --> 00:09:53,040
Why not throw in perfect eyesight?

141
00:09:53,040 --> 00:09:55,800
How about height or muscular structure?

142
00:09:55,800 --> 00:09:56,920
Full hair?

143
00:09:56,920 --> 00:10:00,780
How about giving your child the gift of extraordinary intelligence?

144
00:10:00,780 --> 00:10:05,880
Huge changes are made as a result of the personal decisions of millions of individuals that

145
00:10:05,880 --> 00:10:07,000
accumulate.

146
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:09,480
This is a slippery slope.

147
00:10:09,480 --> 00:10:12,280
Modified humans could become the new standard.

148
00:10:12,280 --> 00:10:16,600
But as engineering becomes more normal and our knowledge improves, we could solve the

149
00:10:16,600 --> 00:10:20,360
single biggest mortality risk factor – aging.

150
00:10:20,360 --> 00:10:26,000
Two-thirds of the 150,000 people who die today will die of age-related causes.

151
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:30,520
Currently, we think aging is caused by the accumulation of damage to our cells, like

152
00:10:30,520 --> 00:10:35,900
DNA breaks and the systems responsible for fixing those wearing off over time.

153
00:10:35,900 --> 00:10:38,880
But there are also genes that directly affect aging.

154
00:10:38,880 --> 00:10:43,760
A combination of genetic engineering and other therapy could stop or slow down aging,

155
00:10:43,760 --> 00:10:46,280
maybe even reverse it.

156
00:10:46,280 --> 00:10:49,760
We know from nature that there are animals immune to aging.

157
00:10:49,760 --> 00:10:53,920
Maybe we could even borrow a few genes for ourselves.

158
00:10:53,920 --> 00:10:58,420
Some scientists even think biological aging could be something that eventually just stops

159
00:10:58,420 --> 00:10:59,960
being a thing.

160
00:10:59,960 --> 00:11:05,140
We would still die at some point, but instead of doing so in hospitals at age 90, we might

161
00:11:05,140 --> 00:11:08,880
be able to spend a few thousand years with our loved ones.

162
00:11:08,880 --> 00:11:12,400
Research into this is in its infancy.

163
00:11:12,400 --> 00:11:16,460
And many scientists are rightly skeptical about the end of aging.

164
00:11:16,460 --> 00:11:21,100
The challenges are enormous, and maybe it is unachievable.

165
00:11:21,100 --> 00:11:25,240
But it is conceivable that people alive today might be the first to profit from effective

166
00:11:25,240 --> 00:11:27,360
anti-aging therapy.

167
00:11:27,360 --> 00:11:31,040
All we might need is for someone to convince a smart billionaire to make it their next

168
00:11:31,040 --> 00:11:33,040
problem to solve.

169
00:11:33,040 --> 00:11:38,300
On a bigger scale, we certainly could solve many problems by having a modified population.

170
00:11:38,300 --> 00:11:41,820
Engineered humans might be better equipped to cope with high-energy food, eliminating

171
00:11:41,820 --> 00:11:45,140
many diseases of civilization like obesity.

172
00:11:45,140 --> 00:11:49,660
In possession of a modified immune system, with a library of potential threats, we might

173
00:11:49,660 --> 00:11:53,440
become immune to most diseases that haunt us today.

174
00:11:53,440 --> 00:11:58,740
Even further into the future, we could engineer humans to be equipped for extended space travel

175
00:11:58,740 --> 00:12:04,240
and to cope with different conditions on other planets, which would be extremely helpful

176
00:12:04,240 --> 00:12:11,860
in keeping us alive in our hostile universe.

177
00:12:11,860 --> 00:12:17,900
Still a few major challenges await us, some technological, some ethical.

178
00:12:17,900 --> 00:12:21,800
Many of you watching will feel uncomfortable and fear that we will create a world in which

179
00:12:21,800 --> 00:12:27,100
we will reject non-perfect humans and pre-select features and qualities based on our idea of

180
00:12:27,100 --> 00:12:28,460
what's healthy.

181
00:12:28,460 --> 00:12:31,700
The thing is, we are already living in this world.

182
00:12:31,700 --> 00:12:36,500
Tests for dozens of genetic diseases or complications have become standard for pregnant women in

183
00:12:36,500 --> 00:12:39,020
much of the world.

184
00:12:39,020 --> 00:12:44,780
Often the mere suspicion of a genetic defect can lead to the end of a pregnancy.

185
00:12:44,780 --> 00:12:49,100
Take Down syndrome, for example, one of the most common genetic defects.

186
00:12:49,100 --> 00:12:54,400
In Europe, about 92% of all pregnancies where it's detected are terminated.

187
00:12:54,400 --> 00:12:58,720
The decision to terminate a pregnancy is incredibly personal, but it's important to acknowledge

188
00:12:58,720 --> 00:13:03,300
the reality that we are pre-selecting humans based on medical conditions.

189
00:13:03,300 --> 00:13:08,340
There is also no use in pretending this will change, so we have to act carefully and respectfully

190
00:13:08,340 --> 00:13:12,840
as we advance the technology and can make more and more selections.

191
00:13:12,840 --> 00:13:15,360
But none of this will happen soon.

192
00:13:15,360 --> 00:13:20,240
As powerful as CRISPR is, and it is, it's not infallible yet.

193
00:13:20,480 --> 00:13:24,960
Wrong edits still happen, as well as unknown errors that could occur anywhere in the DNA

194
00:13:24,960 --> 00:13:26,920
and might go unnoticed.

195
00:13:26,920 --> 00:13:32,140
The gene edit might achieve the desired result, disabling a disease, but also might accidentally

196
00:13:32,140 --> 00:13:34,360
trigger unwanted changes.

197
00:13:34,360 --> 00:13:38,920
We just don't know enough yet about the complex interplay of our genes to avoid unpredictable

198
00:13:38,920 --> 00:13:41,040
consequences.

199
00:13:41,040 --> 00:13:45,760
Working on accuracy and monitoring methods is a major concern as the first human trials

200
00:13:45,760 --> 00:13:46,940
begin.

201
00:13:46,940 --> 00:13:52,320
And since we've discussed a possible positive future, there are darker visions too.

202
00:13:52,320 --> 00:13:57,340
Imagine what a state like North Korea could do if they embraced genetic engineering.

203
00:13:57,340 --> 00:14:02,960
Could a state cement its rule forever by forcing gene editing on their subjects?

204
00:14:02,960 --> 00:14:08,180
What would stop a totalitarian regime from engineering an army of modified super soldiers?

205
00:14:08,180 --> 00:14:10,500
It is doable in theory.

206
00:14:10,500 --> 00:14:15,340
Scenarios like this one are far, far off into the future, if they ever become possible at

207
00:14:15,340 --> 00:14:16,340
all.

208
00:14:16,340 --> 00:14:20,720
No basic proof of concept for genetic engineering like this already exists today.

209
00:14:20,720 --> 00:14:23,620
The technology really is that powerful.

210
00:14:23,620 --> 00:14:28,080
While this might be a tempting reason to ban genetic editing and related research, that

211
00:14:28,080 --> 00:14:30,620
would certainly be a mistake.

212
00:14:30,620 --> 00:14:34,660
Banning human genetic engineering would only lead to the science wandering off to a place

213
00:14:34,660 --> 00:14:38,800
with jurisdiction and rules that we're uncomfortable with.

214
00:14:38,800 --> 00:14:43,940
Only by participating can we make sure that further research is guided by caution, reason,

215
00:14:43,940 --> 00:14:50,140
oversight and transparency.

216
00:14:50,140 --> 00:14:52,500
Do you feel uncomfortable now?

217
00:14:52,500 --> 00:14:54,600
Most of us have something wrong with them.

218
00:14:54,600 --> 00:14:59,440
In the future that lies ahead of us, would we have been allowed to exist?

219
00:14:59,440 --> 00:15:04,360
The technology is certainly a bit scary, but we have a lot to gain and genetic engineering

220
00:15:04,360 --> 00:15:09,700
might just be a step in the natural evolution of intelligent species in the universe.

221
00:15:09,700 --> 00:15:11,860
We might end disease.

222
00:15:11,860 --> 00:15:16,380
We could extend our life expectancy by centuries and travel to the stars.

223
00:15:16,380 --> 00:15:20,300
There's no need to think small when it comes to this topic.

224
00:15:20,300 --> 00:15:25,380
Whatever your opinion on genetic engineering, the future is approaching no matter what.

225
00:15:25,380 --> 00:15:31,180
What has been insane science fiction is about to become our new reality, a reality full

226
00:15:31,180 --> 00:15:38,860
of opportunities and challenges.

227
00:15:38,860 --> 00:15:42,800
