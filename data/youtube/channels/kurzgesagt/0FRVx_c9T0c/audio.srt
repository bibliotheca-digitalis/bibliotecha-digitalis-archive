00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,360
Hello everybody. Today we're doing something different. An exclusive preview.

2
00:00:06,080 --> 00:00:10,800
We'll listen to the introduction and a chapter from the Kurzgesagt book Immune,

3
00:00:10,800 --> 00:00:15,840
a journey into the mysterious system that keeps you alive, written by Kurzgesagt founder and

4
00:00:15,840 --> 00:00:21,840
head writer Philip Debmer. It's about the epic story of the immune system, the most important

5
00:00:21,840 --> 00:00:26,400
thing you don't know enough about, and will forever change how you think about your body.

6
00:00:27,040 --> 00:00:31,840
Immune will be released on November 2nd and you can pre-order it right now.

7
00:00:32,640 --> 00:00:38,240
Links in the description. So now, get comfy for a rare audio-only experience.

8
00:00:41,120 --> 00:00:41,840
Introduction

9
00:00:44,400 --> 00:00:50,080
Imagine waking up tomorrow feeling a bit under the weather. An annoying pain in your throat,

10
00:00:50,080 --> 00:00:55,360
your nose is runny, you cough a bit. All in all, not bad enough to skip work, you think,

11
00:00:55,360 --> 00:00:58,960
as you step into the shower, pretty annoyed about how hard your life is.

12
00:00:59,600 --> 00:01:04,560
While you are totally not being a whiny little baby, your immune system is not complaining.

13
00:01:05,200 --> 00:01:09,920
It is busy keeping you alive so you can live to whine another day.

14
00:01:09,920 --> 00:01:14,880
And so, while intruders roam your body killing hundreds of thousands of your cells,

15
00:01:14,880 --> 00:01:20,720
your immune system is organizing complex defenses, communicating over vast distances,

16
00:01:20,720 --> 00:01:25,920
activating intricate defense networks, and dishing out a swift death to millions,

17
00:01:25,920 --> 00:01:31,600
if not billions of enemies, all while you are standing in the shower, mildly annoyed.

18
00:01:33,040 --> 00:01:39,200
But this complexity is largely hidden. Which is a real shame, because there are not many things

19
00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:45,840
that have such a crucial impact on the quality of your life as your immune system. It is all-embracing

20
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:50,880
and all-encompassing, protecting you from bothersome nuisances like the common cold,

21
00:01:50,880 --> 00:01:56,480
scratches and cuts, to life-threatening stuff from cancer and pneumonia to deadly infections

22
00:01:56,480 --> 00:02:02,800
like COVID-19. Your immune system is as indispensable as your heart or your lungs.

23
00:02:02,800 --> 00:02:08,560
And actually, it is one of the largest and most widespread organ systems throughout your body,

24
00:02:08,560 --> 00:02:11,200
although we don't tend to think about it in these terms.

25
00:02:11,200 --> 00:02:17,760
For most of us, the immune system is a vague and cloud-like entity that follows

26
00:02:17,760 --> 00:02:23,760
strange and untransparent rules, and which seemed to sometimes work and sometimes not.

27
00:02:24,320 --> 00:02:30,160
It is a bit like the weather, extremely hard to predict and subject to endless speculations

28
00:02:30,160 --> 00:02:36,320
and opinions, resulting in actions that feel random to us. Unfortunately, many people speak

29
00:02:36,320 --> 00:02:41,280
about the immune system with confidence, but without actually understanding it. It

30
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:48,080
can be hard to know which information to trust and why. But what even is the immune system,

31
00:02:48,080 --> 00:02:54,240
and how does it actually work? Understanding the mechanisms that are keeping you alive as

32
00:02:54,240 --> 00:03:00,320
you read this is not just a nice exercise in intellectual curiosity, it is desperately needed

33
00:03:00,320 --> 00:03:05,920
knowledge. If you know how the immune system works, you can understand and appreciate vaccines

34
00:03:05,920 --> 00:03:11,360
and how they can save your life or the lives of your children, and approach disease and sickness

35
00:03:11,360 --> 00:03:17,680
with a very different mindset and far less fear. You become less susceptible to snake-all salesmen

36
00:03:17,680 --> 00:03:23,200
who offer wonder drugs that are entirely devoid of logic. You get a better grasp on the kinds

37
00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:28,800
of medication that might actually help you when you are sick. You get to know what you can do to

38
00:03:28,800 --> 00:03:34,240
boost your immune system. You can protect your kids from dangerous microbes, while also not

39
00:03:34,240 --> 00:03:40,400
being too stressed out if they get dirty playing outside. And in the very unlikely case of, say,

40
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:46,080
a global pandemic, knowing what a virus does to you and how your body fights it might help you

41
00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:52,640
understand what the public health experts say. Besides all these practical and useful things,

42
00:03:52,640 --> 00:03:59,040
the immune system is also simply beautiful, a wonder of nature like no other. The immune system

43
00:03:59,040 --> 00:04:05,200
is not a mere tool to make your cough go away. It is inextricably tied into almost all other

44
00:04:05,200 --> 00:04:11,440
processes in your body. And while it is centrally important to keeping you alive, it is likely that

45
00:04:11,440 --> 00:04:18,160
it may also be the part of your body that causes your untimely death either by failing or by being

46
00:04:18,160 --> 00:04:24,960
too active. I have been fascinated and obsessed by the incredible complexity of the human immune

47
00:04:24,960 --> 00:04:30,480
system for the better part of a decade now. It began in university, where I was studying

48
00:04:30,480 --> 00:04:35,600
information design and was looking for a semester project and the immune system seemed like a good

49
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:41,840
idea. So I got a large pile of books about immunology and began digging in, but no matter

50
00:04:41,840 --> 00:04:47,600
how much I read, things just did not get less complicated. The more I learned, the more

51
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:53,360
impossible it seemed to simplify the immune system as every layer revealed more mechanisms,

52
00:04:53,360 --> 00:05:00,240
more exceptions, more complexity. And so a project that was supposed to last the spring

53
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:06,240
took the summer and then the fall and the winter. The interactions of the parts of the immune system

54
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:10,720
were too elegant and the dance they danced was too beautiful to stop learning about them.

55
00:05:11,440 --> 00:05:16,400
This progress fundamentally changed how I experienced and felt about my body.

56
00:05:17,760 --> 00:05:22,240
When I got the flu, I could no longer just complain, but had to look at my body,

57
00:05:22,240 --> 00:05:27,760
touch my swollen lymph nodes and visualize what my immune cells were doing right then,

58
00:05:27,760 --> 00:05:33,840
which part of the network was activated and how T cells killed millions of intruders to protect me.

59
00:05:34,640 --> 00:05:40,160
When I cut myself while being careless in the forest, I felt gratitude for my macrophages,

60
00:05:40,160 --> 00:05:45,360
large immune cells hunting scared bacteria and ripping them into pieces to protect the open

61
00:05:45,360 --> 00:05:51,360
wound from infection. After taking a bite of the wrong granola bar and suffering an allergic shock

62
00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:56,400
while being rushed to the hospital, I thought about mast cells and IGE antibodies

63
00:05:56,400 --> 00:06:01,680
and how they had almost killed me in a misguided attempt to protect me from scary foodstuffs.

64
00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:08,000
When I was diagnosed with cancer at the age of 32 and had to undergo a couple of operations

65
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:12,720
and then chemotherapy, my obsession with immunology became even more intense.

66
00:06:13,360 --> 00:06:18,640
One of the jobs of my immune system is to kill cancer. In this case, it had failed.

67
00:06:19,600 --> 00:06:25,120
But I somehow could not be angry or too upset as I had learned how hard of a job this was for my

68
00:06:25,120 --> 00:06:31,360
immune cells and how hard cancer had to work to keep them in check. And as the chemo melted the

69
00:06:31,360 --> 00:06:37,440
cancer, my thoughts again went to my immune cells invading the dying tumors and eating them up one

70
00:06:37,440 --> 00:06:45,120
cell after another. Disease and sickness are scary and unsettling, and I have had plenty of that in

71
00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:52,080
my life. But knowing how my cells, my immune system, this integral and personal part of myself,

72
00:06:52,080 --> 00:06:58,560
defended the entity that is me, how it fought and died and healed and restored this body I inhabit,

73
00:06:58,560 --> 00:07:04,320
always gave me a lot of comfort. Learning about the immune system made my life better and more

74
00:07:04,320 --> 00:07:10,880
interesting and it alleviated a lot of the anxiety that comes with being sick. Knowing about the

75
00:07:10,880 --> 00:07:18,160
immune system always put things in perspective. So because of this positive effect and just

76
00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:23,280
because of the fun of learning and reading about the immune system, it became an ongoing hobby,

77
00:07:23,280 --> 00:07:29,040
as I eventually became a science communicator and explaining complex things became my purpose

78
00:07:29,040 --> 00:07:34,800
in life. About eight years ago, I started Kurzgesagt in a Nutshell, a YouTube channel

79
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:40,160
dedicated to making information easy to understand and beautiful while trying to be as true to the

80
00:07:40,160 --> 00:07:47,040
science as possible. In early 2021, the Kurzgesagt team has grown to over 40 people working on this

81
00:07:47,040 --> 00:07:52,800
vision, while the channel has attracted over 14 million subscribers and reaches about 30 million

82
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:59,280
viewers each month. So if this large platform exists, why go through the horrible process

83
00:07:59,280 --> 00:08:05,200
of writing this book? Well, while some of our most successful videos have been about the immune

84
00:08:05,200 --> 00:08:10,400
system, it has always bugged me that I could not explore this wonderful topic in the depth it

85
00:08:10,400 --> 00:08:17,040
deserves. A 10-minute video is simply not the right medium for that. So this book is a way to

86
00:08:17,040 --> 00:08:22,480
turn my decade-long love affair with the immune system into something tangible that will hopefully

87
00:08:22,480 --> 00:08:28,240
be a helpful and entertaining way to learn about the stunning and beautiful complexity that makes

88
00:08:28,240 --> 00:08:34,800
it possible for you to survive each day. Unfortunately, the immune system is very

89
00:08:34,800 --> 00:08:40,240
complicated, although that is not strong enough a word. The immune system is complicated in the

90
00:08:40,240 --> 00:08:46,640
sense that climbing Mount Everest is a nice stroll through nature. It is intuitive, like reading the

91
00:08:46,640 --> 00:08:52,960
Chinese translation of the tax code of Germany is a fun Sunday afternoon. The immune system

92
00:08:52,960 --> 00:08:58,240
is the most complex biological system known to humanity other than the human brain.

93
00:08:59,680 --> 00:09:04,560
The bigger the immunology textbook you read, the more layers of detail start piling on,

94
00:09:04,560 --> 00:09:08,800
the more exceptions to rules appear, the more intricate the system becomes,

95
00:09:08,800 --> 00:09:14,400
the more specific it seems to be for every possible eventuality. Every single one of its

96
00:09:14,400 --> 00:09:20,000
many parts has multiple jobs and functions and areas of expertise that overlap and influence

97
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:24,560
each other. Even if you make it past these challenges and still want to understand the

98
00:09:24,560 --> 00:09:29,200
immune system, you will encounter another problem, the humans who described it.

99
00:09:30,800 --> 00:09:35,680
Scientists have laid the foundation for the amazing modern world we get to enjoy today

100
00:09:35,680 --> 00:09:40,880
through hard work and endless curiosity, and we owe them a great deal of gratitude.

101
00:09:40,880 --> 00:09:46,080
Unfortunately, though, many scientists are really bad at choosing good names and coming up with

102
00:09:46,080 --> 00:09:51,520
accessible language for the things they discover. The science of immunology is one of the worst

103
00:09:51,520 --> 00:09:57,440
culprits of any scientific discipline in this regard. An already breathtakingly complex field

104
00:09:57,440 --> 00:10:04,480
is spiked with words like major histocompatibility complex class 1 and 2, gamma-delta T cells

105
00:10:04,480 --> 00:10:12,000
interfere on alpha, beta, gamma, and kappa, and the complement system with actors named C4B2A3B

106
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:17,120
complex. None of this makes it a pleasure to pick up a textbook and learn about the immune system

107
00:10:17,120 --> 00:10:22,240
on your own. But even without this barrier, the complex relationships of the many different

108
00:10:22,240 --> 00:10:28,080
actors of the immune system, with countless exceptions and unintuitive rules, are a challenge

109
00:10:28,080 --> 00:10:34,240
all by themselves. Immunology is hard even for the people working in public health, even for the

110
00:10:34,240 --> 00:10:41,600
people studying immunology, even for the foremost experts in the field. All of this makes the immune

111
00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:47,360
system horrible to explain. If you venture too far into simplification, you deprive the learner

112
00:10:47,360 --> 00:10:53,120
of the beauty and wonder that lie in the evolutionary genius of the sheer endless complexity

113
00:10:53,120 --> 00:10:58,960
that deals with the most crucial problems of living beings. But if you include too much detail,

114
00:10:58,960 --> 00:11:05,280
it quickly becomes mind-numbingly hard to keep up with. Listing everything, every part of the immune

115
00:11:05,280 --> 00:11:11,360
system, is just too much. It would be like telling someone your whole life story on the first date,

116
00:11:11,360 --> 00:11:15,760
overwhelming, and very likely to make them less interested in dating you.

117
00:11:17,040 --> 00:11:23,440
So my aim for this book is to try to carefully dance around all these problems. It will use human

118
00:11:23,440 --> 00:11:29,440
language and use complicated words only when necessary. Where appropriate, processes and

119
00:11:29,440 --> 00:11:35,360
interactions will be simplified while staying as true to the science as possible. Complexity between

120
00:11:35,360 --> 00:11:41,120
chapters will go up and down, so after you are fed a lot of information, there will be more chill parts

121
00:11:41,120 --> 00:11:47,520
to relax a bit. And we will summarize what we learned in regular intervals. I want this book to

122
00:11:47,520 --> 00:11:53,040
make it possible for everybody to understand their own immune system and have a bit of fun doing so.

123
00:11:53,040 --> 00:11:58,000
And since this complexity and beauty are deeply connected to your health and survival,

124
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:03,040
you might actually learn something useful. And of course, the next time you are sick or have

125
00:12:03,040 --> 00:12:07,360
to deal with disease, you hopefully can look at your body from a different perspective.

126
00:12:07,360 --> 00:12:14,880
Also, the obligatory disclaimer. I am not an immunologist, but a science communicator

127
00:12:14,880 --> 00:12:22,160
and immune system enthusiast. This book will not make every immunologist happy. What became obvious

128
00:12:22,160 --> 00:12:27,120
right from the start of the research is that there are a lot of different ideas and concepts about

129
00:12:27,120 --> 00:12:32,000
the details of the immune system and there is a lot of disagreement between the scientists holding

130
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:38,640
these ideas, which is how science is supposed to work. For example, some immunologists consider

131
00:12:38,640 --> 00:12:43,520
certain cells useless fossils, while others think they are crucial for your defenses.

132
00:12:44,080 --> 00:12:48,800
So as much as possible, this book is based on conversations with scientists,

133
00:12:48,800 --> 00:12:53,520
the current literature that is used to teach immunology and peer-reviewed papers.

134
00:12:54,960 --> 00:12:59,040
Still, at some point in the future, parts of this book will need an update,

135
00:12:59,040 --> 00:13:04,800
which is a good thing. The science of immunology is a dynamic field where a lot of amazing things

136
00:13:04,800 --> 00:13:10,480
are happening and different theories and ideas are in flux with each other. The immune system is a

137
00:13:10,480 --> 00:13:15,840
living topic where great discoveries are still happening, which is great because it means we

138
00:13:15,840 --> 00:13:22,880
are learning more about ourselves and the world we live in. Okay, before we jump in and explore

139
00:13:22,880 --> 00:13:28,880
what your immune system is doing, let us define the premise first so we have solid ground to stand

140
00:13:28,880 --> 00:13:35,200
on. What is the immune system? What is the context it works in? And what are the tiny parts that do

141
00:13:35,200 --> 00:13:40,800
the actual work? After we have covered these basics, we will explore what happens if you hurt

142
00:13:40,800 --> 00:13:47,040
yourself and how your immune system rushes in to defend you. Then we'll explore your most vulnerable

143
00:13:47,040 --> 00:13:53,600
parts and see how your body scrambles to protect from a serious infection. And lastly, we'll take

144
00:13:53,600 --> 00:13:58,720
a look at different immune disorders like allergies and autoimmune disease and discuss how you can

145
00:13:58,720 --> 00:14:08,720
boost your immune system. But now, let us get to the very beginning of this story. Two, what is there to

146
00:14:08,720 --> 00:14:16,000
defend? Before we can really learn about your intricate defense system, we should take a look

147
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:23,520
at what needs to be defended, your body. In a sense, this seems pretty straightforward. It is the entire

148
00:14:23,520 --> 00:14:31,040
area under and including your skin. Simple enough, right? But just like looking at a planet in space,

149
00:14:31,040 --> 00:14:34,800
you will never see anything remotely approaching the full picture from orbit.

150
00:14:36,240 --> 00:14:42,240
So, before we do anything else, first we need to go on a journey together into a strange and foreign

151
00:14:42,240 --> 00:14:49,040
world, stranger than the deep sea or an alien planet. A world where no living being therein

152
00:14:49,040 --> 00:14:56,160
even knows that it exists, where monsters are a daily reality but nobody cares. A world billions

153
00:14:56,160 --> 00:15:03,360
of years old that exists within yourself, within everybody and everything, all around us, omnipresent

154
00:15:03,360 --> 00:15:10,320
but invisible. This is the world of the tiny where the border between dead and alive becomes fuzzy,

155
00:15:10,320 --> 00:15:17,360
where biochemistry becomes life for reasons we still do not understand. Let us zoom into you

156
00:15:17,360 --> 00:15:24,080
and take a look into your organs through the tissue to our most fundamental building blocks, your cells.

157
00:15:25,760 --> 00:15:30,880
Cells are extremely tiny living things among the smallest units of life on earth.

158
00:15:31,520 --> 00:15:37,360
For a single cell, your body is a planet drifting through a hostile universe. To understand the

159
00:15:37,360 --> 00:15:41,680
enormous dimensions of your body, we need to look at it from a cell's perspective.

160
00:15:42,400 --> 00:15:48,880
At the scale of a cell, your body is an utterly gigantic structure of pipes as wide as mountains,

161
00:15:48,880 --> 00:15:54,000
filled with oceans of fluids, rapid torrents permeating intricate cave systems,

162
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:59,760
stretching as far as whole countries. With the exception of the crystallized and hard parts of

163
00:15:59,760 --> 00:16:05,200
your bones, all of the environment, all of the world really, is to a cell, alive.

164
00:16:06,320 --> 00:16:12,160
A cell can politely ask a wall to let it pass and then squeeze through a tiny gap that closes

165
00:16:12,160 --> 00:16:18,560
behind it. It can swim through channels and hike up mountains of meat to get anywhere it needs to go.

166
00:16:19,920 --> 00:16:25,760
If you were the size of one of your cells, the body of a human would be in the area of 15 to

167
00:16:25,760 --> 00:16:32,800
20 Mount Everest stacked on top of each other. It would be a mountain of flesh at least 60 miles,

168
00:16:32,800 --> 00:16:39,520
100 kilometers tall, reaching into space. If you are near a window, take a second and look into

169
00:16:39,520 --> 00:16:46,160
the sky. Try to imagine this for a moment. A giant so large that passenger planes would crash against

170
00:16:46,160 --> 00:16:50,640
its lower legs, its head so far above you that you would not be able to see it.

171
00:16:51,360 --> 00:16:58,160
The cells of your immune system are tasked to defend all of that, especially the weak points

172
00:16:58,160 --> 00:17:04,400
where intruders can enter it, which is mostly the borders, the outsides of the body. When you think

173
00:17:04,400 --> 00:17:10,640
about your outsides, the first thing that comes to mind is, of course, your skin. The total surface

174
00:17:10,640 --> 00:17:16,800
area of your skin is about two square yards, meters, about half the size of a pool table,

175
00:17:17,360 --> 00:17:23,280
and luckily is not that hard to defend since most of it is made out of a hard and thick barrier

176
00:17:23,280 --> 00:17:29,360
covered with its own defense system. It feels soft, but it is pretty hard to breach if it is intact.

177
00:17:30,800 --> 00:17:36,320
Your real weak points to infections are your mucous membranes, the surface that lines your

178
00:17:36,320 --> 00:17:43,200
windpipe and lungs, eyelids, mouth and nose, your stomach and intestines, your reproductive tracks

179
00:17:43,200 --> 00:17:49,120
and bladder. It is hard to give their total surface area since numbers vary so much from

180
00:17:49,120 --> 00:17:55,600
person to person, but on average there are about 200 square yards, meters of mucous membranes and

181
00:17:55,600 --> 00:18:01,840
a healthy adult, about the same as a tennis court, most of them being your lungs and your digestive

182
00:18:01,840 --> 00:18:09,440
tract. You may mistakenly think of your mucous membranes as your insides, but this is not true.

183
00:18:09,440 --> 00:18:16,000
Your mucous membranes are outsides. If we took an honest look at what you are, you are in a sense

184
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:23,280
nothing more than a complex tube, granted a tube that can close both ends, also a lot wetter,

185
00:18:23,280 --> 00:18:30,320
slimier and grosser. Your reproductive organs, nostrils and ears are extra holes,

186
00:18:30,320 --> 00:18:34,480
entrances to large tunnels and additional cave systems that reach through you.

187
00:18:35,280 --> 00:18:41,520
All of these places are your direct borders, contact points with the outside world. Your body

188
00:18:41,520 --> 00:18:47,680
is just wrapped around them. These outsides, within your insides, represent surfaces where

189
00:18:47,680 --> 00:18:53,520
millions of intruders are trying to enter you every day. A lot of ground to defend when you are

190
00:18:53,520 --> 00:18:59,680
the size of a cell. For your cells, the surface area of the mucous membranes is as big as central

191
00:18:59,680 --> 00:19:05,840
Europe or the central United States are to you. Building border walls would not do the trick for

192
00:19:05,840 --> 00:19:11,920
them since they don't need to defend just the borders, but the entire surface. It's not like

193
00:19:11,920 --> 00:19:16,960
intruders are trying to enter just at the edges. They could sort of drop in with parachutes.

194
00:19:17,600 --> 00:19:25,600
So your cells need to defend the entire continent, all of it. Still, it's much easier to catch an

195
00:19:25,600 --> 00:19:30,400
enemy at one of these points than somewhere else. For example, if we took all the blood

196
00:19:30,400 --> 00:19:35,440
vessels and capillaries from your body and laid them out in a straight line, they would be a

197
00:19:35,440 --> 00:19:43,840
baffling 74,000 miles, 120,000 kilometers long, three times the circumference of Earth, with about

198
00:19:43,840 --> 00:19:52,560
1,400 square yards, 1,200 square meters of surface area. So, better catch enemies at the borders that

199
00:19:52,560 --> 00:20:00,480
are significantly smaller and therefore easier to defend. But easier does not mean easy. Let's

200
00:20:00,480 --> 00:20:06,000
do a fun experiment and imagine that we wanted to build a human body to scale, but from actual

201
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:11,920
people like you, living, breathing humans, just to see what sort of crazy dimensions we encounter

202
00:20:11,920 --> 00:20:20,000
here. So first, we need a lot of people for that. The average human body is made from around 40

203
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:32,880
trillion cells. Trillion. 40 trillion is 40,000,000,000,000,000. A truly impressive number.

204
00:20:33,760 --> 00:20:39,040
If we want your cells to be represented by individual people, then we need more than 100

205
00:20:39,040 --> 00:20:44,960
times as many people as have lived in the 250,000-year-long history of humanity.

206
00:20:45,840 --> 00:20:52,320
Let's try to visualize this a bit. Right now, around 7.8 billion people are alive.

207
00:20:52,960 --> 00:20:57,520
If we put them shoulder to shoulder, they surprisingly would only cover an area

208
00:20:57,520 --> 00:21:03,680
of around 700 square miles, 1,800 square kilometers, which is a little bit more

209
00:21:03,680 --> 00:21:10,880
than the surface area of London. To get 40 trillion people, we need to multiply this by 120.

210
00:21:10,880 --> 00:21:18,160
And this is only half of the story because your body hosts bacteria that you need to survive.

211
00:21:18,160 --> 00:21:23,680
How many? One bacterium for each of the 40 trillion cells in your body, which happens

212
00:21:23,680 --> 00:21:28,880
to be a pretty good ballpark in terms of size. If you were the size of an average body cell,

213
00:21:28,880 --> 00:21:34,720
a bacterium would be roughly the size of a bunny. Let us imagine them as baby bunnies to make the

214
00:21:34,720 --> 00:21:40,160
thought less horrifying. Most of these cute bunnies live in your gut. In this ginormous

215
00:21:40,160 --> 00:21:46,160
cave, 36 trillion bunnies live their lives constantly dying and reproducing, breaking

216
00:21:46,160 --> 00:21:50,960
down chunks of food the size of skyscrapers so it can be distributed to all the people making

217
00:21:50,960 --> 00:21:56,640
up the continent of flesh. The other 4 trillion bunnies are crawling on your skin, are inside

218
00:21:56,640 --> 00:22:01,280
your lungs, hopping over your teeth and your tongue, they swim in the fluid of your eyes,

219
00:22:01,280 --> 00:22:06,320
crawl in and out of your ears. We'll talk more about them later, but for now, just imagine

220
00:22:06,320 --> 00:22:11,760
yourself as being covered by cute bunnies who are your friends and have only your best interests in

221
00:22:11,760 --> 00:22:20,080
mind. Okay, so we now have 40 trillion people standing shoulder to shoulder. This ocean of

222
00:22:20,080 --> 00:22:25,040
people would cover the whole of the United Kingdom, every last corner, lake and mountain.

223
00:22:25,760 --> 00:22:30,640
To make a body to scale, made of people representing cells, we need to stack them

224
00:22:30,640 --> 00:22:35,920
until trillions of people are standing on top of each other, holding hands and linking arms,

225
00:22:35,920 --> 00:22:43,360
forming living structures. A giant made out of flesh rises 60 miles, 100 kilometers, into the

226
00:22:43,360 --> 00:22:50,160
sky, reaching the edge of space. The giant is made up of caverns as wide as small countries,

227
00:22:50,160 --> 00:22:56,560
bones as dense and wide as mountains, filled with intricate caves and tunnels. Its arteries

228
00:22:56,560 --> 00:23:02,240
are filled with oceans of fluid and people carrying food and oxygen tanks to every last corner.

229
00:23:03,120 --> 00:23:08,560
If you were a red blood cell, or in this case, red blood person, you would travel the distance

230
00:23:08,560 --> 00:23:14,080
from Paris to Rome and back once a minute in a stream pumped by a heart as large as a city.

231
00:23:14,880 --> 00:23:20,320
Things could be great. Everybody would work together to keep the mountain of flesh and,

232
00:23:20,320 --> 00:23:27,120
in consequence, themselves alive. But the enormous richness of resources and food

233
00:23:27,120 --> 00:23:33,760
and the abundance of moist, warm space is just too attractive. The giant is not only the size

234
00:23:33,760 --> 00:23:40,640
of a continent for its inhabitants, but also for unwelcome visitors. Literally billions of parasites

235
00:23:40,640 --> 00:23:46,480
are trying to get inside the flesh giant. Some are as large as elephants or blue whales,

236
00:23:46,480 --> 00:23:51,920
and they want to lay giant eggs so their young can feast on the poor people that make up the tissues.

237
00:23:52,560 --> 00:23:57,760
Others are the size of raccoons or rats who want to steal the food and make the giant their

238
00:23:57,760 --> 00:24:03,360
permanent home to raise generations of their offspring. They may not intend to harm the

239
00:24:03,360 --> 00:24:08,960
people making up the body, but they will do so by defecating everywhere, making life miserable.

240
00:24:09,680 --> 00:24:15,440
The most disgusting vermin our flesh giant has to deal with daily are billions of spiders who

241
00:24:15,440 --> 00:24:20,160
want to enter the cell people's mouths or ears to breed in the stomachs of their victims.

242
00:24:20,720 --> 00:24:26,320
For a giant made up of trillions of people, losing a few here and there is not really dangerous.

243
00:24:26,320 --> 00:24:32,800
But if the vermin were allowed to procreate freely, it could be its end. Isn't the idea horrifying?

244
00:24:34,320 --> 00:24:39,520
This is what your cells deal with every single day and night from your birth until the day you die.

245
00:24:40,160 --> 00:24:45,360
Staying alive is not a thing you should take for granted. But don't let this idea of being

246
00:24:45,360 --> 00:24:51,120
attacked distress you too much. You are not just a mountain of flesh waiting to be conquered.

247
00:24:51,120 --> 00:24:55,920
Thankfully, you have a great ally in this fight for survival that, as we now know,

248
00:24:55,920 --> 00:25:01,200
we simply don't cherish and celebrate as much as it deserves your immune system.

249
00:25:02,720 --> 00:25:08,320
It makes you a fortress, and even more, a fortress filled with billions of the most

250
00:25:08,320 --> 00:25:14,240
effective and fierce soldiers in the universe. They have countless weapons at their disposal,

251
00:25:14,240 --> 00:25:20,080
and they use them without mercy. Your immune system army has already killed billions of

252
00:25:20,080 --> 00:25:25,680
enemies and parasites in your life, and it is ready to kill billions or trillions more.

253
00:25:28,640 --> 00:25:33,600
Okay, that's it for now. If you want to learn more about the epic tale of your immune system,

254
00:25:34,240 --> 00:25:39,840
you can pre-order the book via the links below. It's available as an audiobook and as a real book

255
00:25:39,840 --> 00:25:55,200
