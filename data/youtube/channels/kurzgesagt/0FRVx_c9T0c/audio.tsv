0	5360	Hello everybody. Today we're doing something different. An exclusive preview.
6080	10800	We'll listen to the introduction and a chapter from the Kurzgesagt book Immune,
10800	15840	a journey into the mysterious system that keeps you alive, written by Kurzgesagt founder and
15840	21840	head writer Philip Debmer. It's about the epic story of the immune system, the most important
21840	26400	thing you don't know enough about, and will forever change how you think about your body.
27040	31840	Immune will be released on November 2nd and you can pre-order it right now.
32640	38240	Links in the description. So now, get comfy for a rare audio-only experience.
41120	41840	Introduction
44400	50080	Imagine waking up tomorrow feeling a bit under the weather. An annoying pain in your throat,
50080	55360	your nose is runny, you cough a bit. All in all, not bad enough to skip work, you think,
55360	58960	as you step into the shower, pretty annoyed about how hard your life is.
59600	64560	While you are totally not being a whiny little baby, your immune system is not complaining.
65200	69920	It is busy keeping you alive so you can live to whine another day.
69920	74880	And so, while intruders roam your body killing hundreds of thousands of your cells,
74880	80720	your immune system is organizing complex defenses, communicating over vast distances,
80720	85920	activating intricate defense networks, and dishing out a swift death to millions,
85920	91600	if not billions of enemies, all while you are standing in the shower, mildly annoyed.
93040	99200	But this complexity is largely hidden. Which is a real shame, because there are not many things
99200	105840	that have such a crucial impact on the quality of your life as your immune system. It is all-embracing
105840	110880	and all-encompassing, protecting you from bothersome nuisances like the common cold,
110880	116480	scratches and cuts, to life-threatening stuff from cancer and pneumonia to deadly infections
116480	122800	like COVID-19. Your immune system is as indispensable as your heart or your lungs.
122800	128560	And actually, it is one of the largest and most widespread organ systems throughout your body,
128560	131200	although we don't tend to think about it in these terms.
131200	137760	For most of us, the immune system is a vague and cloud-like entity that follows
137760	143760	strange and untransparent rules, and which seemed to sometimes work and sometimes not.
144320	150160	It is a bit like the weather, extremely hard to predict and subject to endless speculations
150160	156320	and opinions, resulting in actions that feel random to us. Unfortunately, many people speak
156320	161280	about the immune system with confidence, but without actually understanding it. It
161280	168080	can be hard to know which information to trust and why. But what even is the immune system,
168080	174240	and how does it actually work? Understanding the mechanisms that are keeping you alive as
174240	180320	you read this is not just a nice exercise in intellectual curiosity, it is desperately needed
180320	185920	knowledge. If you know how the immune system works, you can understand and appreciate vaccines
185920	191360	and how they can save your life or the lives of your children, and approach disease and sickness
191360	197680	with a very different mindset and far less fear. You become less susceptible to snake-all salesmen
197680	203200	who offer wonder drugs that are entirely devoid of logic. You get a better grasp on the kinds
203200	208800	of medication that might actually help you when you are sick. You get to know what you can do to
208800	214240	boost your immune system. You can protect your kids from dangerous microbes, while also not
214240	220400	being too stressed out if they get dirty playing outside. And in the very unlikely case of, say,
220400	226080	a global pandemic, knowing what a virus does to you and how your body fights it might help you
226080	232640	understand what the public health experts say. Besides all these practical and useful things,
232640	239040	the immune system is also simply beautiful, a wonder of nature like no other. The immune system
239040	245200	is not a mere tool to make your cough go away. It is inextricably tied into almost all other
245200	251440	processes in your body. And while it is centrally important to keeping you alive, it is likely that
251440	258160	it may also be the part of your body that causes your untimely death either by failing or by being
258160	264960	too active. I have been fascinated and obsessed by the incredible complexity of the human immune
264960	270480	system for the better part of a decade now. It began in university, where I was studying
270480	275600	information design and was looking for a semester project and the immune system seemed like a good
275600	281840	idea. So I got a large pile of books about immunology and began digging in, but no matter
281840	287600	how much I read, things just did not get less complicated. The more I learned, the more
287600	293360	impossible it seemed to simplify the immune system as every layer revealed more mechanisms,
293360	300240	more exceptions, more complexity. And so a project that was supposed to last the spring
300240	306240	took the summer and then the fall and the winter. The interactions of the parts of the immune system
306240	310720	were too elegant and the dance they danced was too beautiful to stop learning about them.
311440	316400	This progress fundamentally changed how I experienced and felt about my body.
317760	322240	When I got the flu, I could no longer just complain, but had to look at my body,
322240	327760	touch my swollen lymph nodes and visualize what my immune cells were doing right then,
327760	333840	which part of the network was activated and how T cells killed millions of intruders to protect me.
334640	340160	When I cut myself while being careless in the forest, I felt gratitude for my macrophages,
340160	345360	large immune cells hunting scared bacteria and ripping them into pieces to protect the open
345360	351360	wound from infection. After taking a bite of the wrong granola bar and suffering an allergic shock
351360	356400	while being rushed to the hospital, I thought about mast cells and IGE antibodies
356400	361680	and how they had almost killed me in a misguided attempt to protect me from scary foodstuffs.
363120	368000	When I was diagnosed with cancer at the age of 32 and had to undergo a couple of operations
368000	372720	and then chemotherapy, my obsession with immunology became even more intense.
373360	378640	One of the jobs of my immune system is to kill cancer. In this case, it had failed.
379600	385120	But I somehow could not be angry or too upset as I had learned how hard of a job this was for my
385120	391360	immune cells and how hard cancer had to work to keep them in check. And as the chemo melted the
391360	397440	cancer, my thoughts again went to my immune cells invading the dying tumors and eating them up one
397440	405120	cell after another. Disease and sickness are scary and unsettling, and I have had plenty of that in
405600	412080	my life. But knowing how my cells, my immune system, this integral and personal part of myself,
412080	418560	defended the entity that is me, how it fought and died and healed and restored this body I inhabit,
418560	424320	always gave me a lot of comfort. Learning about the immune system made my life better and more
424320	430880	interesting and it alleviated a lot of the anxiety that comes with being sick. Knowing about the
430880	438160	immune system always put things in perspective. So because of this positive effect and just
438160	443280	because of the fun of learning and reading about the immune system, it became an ongoing hobby,
443280	449040	as I eventually became a science communicator and explaining complex things became my purpose
449040	454800	in life. About eight years ago, I started Kurzgesagt in a Nutshell, a YouTube channel
454800	460160	dedicated to making information easy to understand and beautiful while trying to be as true to the
460160	467040	science as possible. In early 2021, the Kurzgesagt team has grown to over 40 people working on this
467040	472800	vision, while the channel has attracted over 14 million subscribers and reaches about 30 million
472800	479280	viewers each month. So if this large platform exists, why go through the horrible process
479280	485200	of writing this book? Well, while some of our most successful videos have been about the immune
485200	490400	system, it has always bugged me that I could not explore this wonderful topic in the depth it
490400	497040	deserves. A 10-minute video is simply not the right medium for that. So this book is a way to
497040	502480	turn my decade-long love affair with the immune system into something tangible that will hopefully
502480	508240	be a helpful and entertaining way to learn about the stunning and beautiful complexity that makes
508240	514800	it possible for you to survive each day. Unfortunately, the immune system is very
514800	520240	complicated, although that is not strong enough a word. The immune system is complicated in the
520240	526640	sense that climbing Mount Everest is a nice stroll through nature. It is intuitive, like reading the
526640	532960	Chinese translation of the tax code of Germany is a fun Sunday afternoon. The immune system
532960	538240	is the most complex biological system known to humanity other than the human brain.
539680	544560	The bigger the immunology textbook you read, the more layers of detail start piling on,
544560	548800	the more exceptions to rules appear, the more intricate the system becomes,
548800	554400	the more specific it seems to be for every possible eventuality. Every single one of its
554400	560000	many parts has multiple jobs and functions and areas of expertise that overlap and influence
560000	564560	each other. Even if you make it past these challenges and still want to understand the
564560	569200	immune system, you will encounter another problem, the humans who described it.
570800	575680	Scientists have laid the foundation for the amazing modern world we get to enjoy today
575680	580880	through hard work and endless curiosity, and we owe them a great deal of gratitude.
580880	586080	Unfortunately, though, many scientists are really bad at choosing good names and coming up with
586080	591520	accessible language for the things they discover. The science of immunology is one of the worst
591520	597440	culprits of any scientific discipline in this regard. An already breathtakingly complex field
597440	604480	is spiked with words like major histocompatibility complex class 1 and 2, gamma-delta T cells
604480	612000	interfere on alpha, beta, gamma, and kappa, and the complement system with actors named C4B2A3B
612000	617120	complex. None of this makes it a pleasure to pick up a textbook and learn about the immune system
617120	622240	on your own. But even without this barrier, the complex relationships of the many different
622240	628080	actors of the immune system, with countless exceptions and unintuitive rules, are a challenge
628080	634240	all by themselves. Immunology is hard even for the people working in public health, even for the
634240	641600	people studying immunology, even for the foremost experts in the field. All of this makes the immune
641600	647360	system horrible to explain. If you venture too far into simplification, you deprive the learner
647360	653120	of the beauty and wonder that lie in the evolutionary genius of the sheer endless complexity
653120	658960	that deals with the most crucial problems of living beings. But if you include too much detail,
658960	665280	it quickly becomes mind-numbingly hard to keep up with. Listing everything, every part of the immune
665280	671360	system, is just too much. It would be like telling someone your whole life story on the first date,
671360	675760	overwhelming, and very likely to make them less interested in dating you.
677040	683440	So my aim for this book is to try to carefully dance around all these problems. It will use human
683440	689440	language and use complicated words only when necessary. Where appropriate, processes and
689440	695360	interactions will be simplified while staying as true to the science as possible. Complexity between
695360	701120	chapters will go up and down, so after you are fed a lot of information, there will be more chill parts
701120	707520	to relax a bit. And we will summarize what we learned in regular intervals. I want this book to
707520	713040	make it possible for everybody to understand their own immune system and have a bit of fun doing so.
713040	718000	And since this complexity and beauty are deeply connected to your health and survival,
718000	723040	you might actually learn something useful. And of course, the next time you are sick or have
723040	727360	to deal with disease, you hopefully can look at your body from a different perspective.
727360	734880	Also, the obligatory disclaimer. I am not an immunologist, but a science communicator
734880	742160	and immune system enthusiast. This book will not make every immunologist happy. What became obvious
742160	747120	right from the start of the research is that there are a lot of different ideas and concepts about
747120	752000	the details of the immune system and there is a lot of disagreement between the scientists holding
752000	758640	these ideas, which is how science is supposed to work. For example, some immunologists consider
758640	763520	certain cells useless fossils, while others think they are crucial for your defenses.
764080	768800	So as much as possible, this book is based on conversations with scientists,
768800	773520	the current literature that is used to teach immunology and peer-reviewed papers.
774960	779040	Still, at some point in the future, parts of this book will need an update,
779040	784800	which is a good thing. The science of immunology is a dynamic field where a lot of amazing things
784800	790480	are happening and different theories and ideas are in flux with each other. The immune system is a
790480	795840	living topic where great discoveries are still happening, which is great because it means we
795840	802880	are learning more about ourselves and the world we live in. Okay, before we jump in and explore
802880	808880	what your immune system is doing, let us define the premise first so we have solid ground to stand
808880	815200	on. What is the immune system? What is the context it works in? And what are the tiny parts that do
815200	820800	the actual work? After we have covered these basics, we will explore what happens if you hurt
820800	827040	yourself and how your immune system rushes in to defend you. Then we'll explore your most vulnerable
827040	833600	parts and see how your body scrambles to protect from a serious infection. And lastly, we'll take
833600	838720	a look at different immune disorders like allergies and autoimmune disease and discuss how you can
838720	848720	boost your immune system. But now, let us get to the very beginning of this story. Two, what is there to
848720	856000	defend? Before we can really learn about your intricate defense system, we should take a look
856000	863520	at what needs to be defended, your body. In a sense, this seems pretty straightforward. It is the entire
863520	871040	area under and including your skin. Simple enough, right? But just like looking at a planet in space,
871040	874800	you will never see anything remotely approaching the full picture from orbit.
876240	882240	So, before we do anything else, first we need to go on a journey together into a strange and foreign
882240	889040	world, stranger than the deep sea or an alien planet. A world where no living being therein
889040	896160	even knows that it exists, where monsters are a daily reality but nobody cares. A world billions
896160	903360	of years old that exists within yourself, within everybody and everything, all around us, omnipresent
903360	910320	but invisible. This is the world of the tiny where the border between dead and alive becomes fuzzy,
910320	917360	where biochemistry becomes life for reasons we still do not understand. Let us zoom into you
917360	924080	and take a look into your organs through the tissue to our most fundamental building blocks, your cells.
925760	930880	Cells are extremely tiny living things among the smallest units of life on earth.
931520	937360	For a single cell, your body is a planet drifting through a hostile universe. To understand the
937360	941680	enormous dimensions of your body, we need to look at it from a cell's perspective.
942400	948880	At the scale of a cell, your body is an utterly gigantic structure of pipes as wide as mountains,
948880	954000	filled with oceans of fluids, rapid torrents permeating intricate cave systems,
954000	959760	stretching as far as whole countries. With the exception of the crystallized and hard parts of
959760	965200	your bones, all of the environment, all of the world really, is to a cell, alive.
966320	972160	A cell can politely ask a wall to let it pass and then squeeze through a tiny gap that closes
972160	978560	behind it. It can swim through channels and hike up mountains of meat to get anywhere it needs to go.
979920	985760	If you were the size of one of your cells, the body of a human would be in the area of 15 to
985760	992800	20 Mount Everest stacked on top of each other. It would be a mountain of flesh at least 60 miles,
992800	999520	100 kilometers tall, reaching into space. If you are near a window, take a second and look into
999520	1006160	the sky. Try to imagine this for a moment. A giant so large that passenger planes would crash against
1006160	1010640	its lower legs, its head so far above you that you would not be able to see it.
1011360	1018160	The cells of your immune system are tasked to defend all of that, especially the weak points
1018160	1024400	where intruders can enter it, which is mostly the borders, the outsides of the body. When you think
1024400	1030640	about your outsides, the first thing that comes to mind is, of course, your skin. The total surface
1030640	1036800	area of your skin is about two square yards, meters, about half the size of a pool table,
1037360	1043280	and luckily is not that hard to defend since most of it is made out of a hard and thick barrier
1043280	1049360	covered with its own defense system. It feels soft, but it is pretty hard to breach if it is intact.
1050800	1056320	Your real weak points to infections are your mucous membranes, the surface that lines your
1056320	1063200	windpipe and lungs, eyelids, mouth and nose, your stomach and intestines, your reproductive tracks
1063200	1069120	and bladder. It is hard to give their total surface area since numbers vary so much from
1069120	1075600	person to person, but on average there are about 200 square yards, meters of mucous membranes and
1075600	1081840	a healthy adult, about the same as a tennis court, most of them being your lungs and your digestive
1081840	1089440	tract. You may mistakenly think of your mucous membranes as your insides, but this is not true.
1089440	1096000	Your mucous membranes are outsides. If we took an honest look at what you are, you are in a sense
1096000	1103280	nothing more than a complex tube, granted a tube that can close both ends, also a lot wetter,
1103280	1110320	slimier and grosser. Your reproductive organs, nostrils and ears are extra holes,
1110320	1114480	entrances to large tunnels and additional cave systems that reach through you.
1115280	1121520	All of these places are your direct borders, contact points with the outside world. Your body
1121520	1127680	is just wrapped around them. These outsides, within your insides, represent surfaces where
1127680	1133520	millions of intruders are trying to enter you every day. A lot of ground to defend when you are
1133520	1139680	the size of a cell. For your cells, the surface area of the mucous membranes is as big as central
1139680	1145840	Europe or the central United States are to you. Building border walls would not do the trick for
1145840	1151920	them since they don't need to defend just the borders, but the entire surface. It's not like
1151920	1156960	intruders are trying to enter just at the edges. They could sort of drop in with parachutes.
1157600	1165600	So your cells need to defend the entire continent, all of it. Still, it's much easier to catch an
1165600	1170400	enemy at one of these points than somewhere else. For example, if we took all the blood
1170400	1175440	vessels and capillaries from your body and laid them out in a straight line, they would be a
1175440	1183840	baffling 74,000 miles, 120,000 kilometers long, three times the circumference of Earth, with about
1183840	1192560	1,400 square yards, 1,200 square meters of surface area. So, better catch enemies at the borders that
1192560	1200480	are significantly smaller and therefore easier to defend. But easier does not mean easy. Let's
1200480	1206000	do a fun experiment and imagine that we wanted to build a human body to scale, but from actual
1206000	1211920	people like you, living, breathing humans, just to see what sort of crazy dimensions we encounter
1211920	1220000	here. So first, we need a lot of people for that. The average human body is made from around 40
1220000	1232880	trillion cells. Trillion. 40 trillion is 40,000,000,000,000,000. A truly impressive number.
1233760	1239040	If we want your cells to be represented by individual people, then we need more than 100
1239040	1244960	times as many people as have lived in the 250,000-year-long history of humanity.
1245840	1252320	Let's try to visualize this a bit. Right now, around 7.8 billion people are alive.
1252960	1257520	If we put them shoulder to shoulder, they surprisingly would only cover an area
1257520	1263680	of around 700 square miles, 1,800 square kilometers, which is a little bit more
1263680	1270880	than the surface area of London. To get 40 trillion people, we need to multiply this by 120.
1270880	1278160	And this is only half of the story because your body hosts bacteria that you need to survive.
1278160	1283680	How many? One bacterium for each of the 40 trillion cells in your body, which happens
1283680	1288880	to be a pretty good ballpark in terms of size. If you were the size of an average body cell,
1288880	1294720	a bacterium would be roughly the size of a bunny. Let us imagine them as baby bunnies to make the
1294720	1300160	thought less horrifying. Most of these cute bunnies live in your gut. In this ginormous
1300160	1306160	cave, 36 trillion bunnies live their lives constantly dying and reproducing, breaking
1306160	1310960	down chunks of food the size of skyscrapers so it can be distributed to all the people making
1310960	1316640	up the continent of flesh. The other 4 trillion bunnies are crawling on your skin, are inside
1316640	1321280	your lungs, hopping over your teeth and your tongue, they swim in the fluid of your eyes,
1321280	1326320	crawl in and out of your ears. We'll talk more about them later, but for now, just imagine
1326320	1331760	yourself as being covered by cute bunnies who are your friends and have only your best interests in
1331760	1340080	mind. Okay, so we now have 40 trillion people standing shoulder to shoulder. This ocean of
1340080	1345040	people would cover the whole of the United Kingdom, every last corner, lake and mountain.
1345760	1350640	To make a body to scale, made of people representing cells, we need to stack them
1350640	1355920	until trillions of people are standing on top of each other, holding hands and linking arms,
1355920	1363360	forming living structures. A giant made out of flesh rises 60 miles, 100 kilometers, into the
1363360	1370160	sky, reaching the edge of space. The giant is made up of caverns as wide as small countries,
1370160	1376560	bones as dense and wide as mountains, filled with intricate caves and tunnels. Its arteries
1376560	1382240	are filled with oceans of fluid and people carrying food and oxygen tanks to every last corner.
1383120	1388560	If you were a red blood cell, or in this case, red blood person, you would travel the distance
1388560	1394080	from Paris to Rome and back once a minute in a stream pumped by a heart as large as a city.
1394880	1400320	Things could be great. Everybody would work together to keep the mountain of flesh and,
1400320	1407120	in consequence, themselves alive. But the enormous richness of resources and food
1407120	1413760	and the abundance of moist, warm space is just too attractive. The giant is not only the size
1413760	1420640	of a continent for its inhabitants, but also for unwelcome visitors. Literally billions of parasites
1420640	1426480	are trying to get inside the flesh giant. Some are as large as elephants or blue whales,
1426480	1431920	and they want to lay giant eggs so their young can feast on the poor people that make up the tissues.
1432560	1437760	Others are the size of raccoons or rats who want to steal the food and make the giant their
1437760	1443360	permanent home to raise generations of their offspring. They may not intend to harm the
1443360	1448960	people making up the body, but they will do so by defecating everywhere, making life miserable.
1449680	1455440	The most disgusting vermin our flesh giant has to deal with daily are billions of spiders who
1455440	1460160	want to enter the cell people's mouths or ears to breed in the stomachs of their victims.
1460720	1466320	For a giant made up of trillions of people, losing a few here and there is not really dangerous.
1466320	1472800	But if the vermin were allowed to procreate freely, it could be its end. Isn't the idea horrifying?
1474320	1479520	This is what your cells deal with every single day and night from your birth until the day you die.
1480160	1485360	Staying alive is not a thing you should take for granted. But don't let this idea of being
1485360	1491120	attacked distress you too much. You are not just a mountain of flesh waiting to be conquered.
1491120	1495920	Thankfully, you have a great ally in this fight for survival that, as we now know,
1495920	1501200	we simply don't cherish and celebrate as much as it deserves your immune system.
1502720	1508320	It makes you a fortress, and even more, a fortress filled with billions of the most
1508320	1514240	effective and fierce soldiers in the universe. They have countless weapons at their disposal,
1514240	1520080	and they use them without mercy. Your immune system army has already killed billions of
1520080	1525680	enemies and parasites in your life, and it is ready to kill billions or trillions more.
1528640	1533600	Okay, that's it for now. If you want to learn more about the epic tale of your immune system,
