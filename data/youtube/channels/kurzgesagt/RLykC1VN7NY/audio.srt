1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,500
Imagine if you could gather the energy from every star within a hundred million light-years,

2
00:00:05,500 --> 00:00:10,000
from thousands of galaxies, each with billions of stars.

3
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:16,000
Imagine you could take this kind of power and use it to fire the biggest super-weapon in the universe.

4
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:19,000
Imagine the damage you could do.

5
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:26,000
It turns out, you don't need to imagine it, these exist, and they're called gamma-ray bursts.

6
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:28,000
But what are these cosmic snipers?

7
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:32,000
And what happens if one takes a shot at Earth?

8
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:46,000
To understand gamma-ray bursts, we first have to understand gamma rays.

9
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:52,000
Gamma rays are electromagnetic radiation, waves which carry energy, just like visible light.

10
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:58,000
Visible light is a tiny part of the electromagnetic spectrum, it's the part your eyes can see.

11
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:03,000
At lower energies, there are radio waves, microwaves, and infrared.

12
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:08,000
And at higher energies, ultraviolet, x-rays, and gamma rays.

13
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:11,000
Gamma rays are incredibly powerful.

14
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:17,000
A single gamma-ray photon is more energetic than a million visible photons combined.

15
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:21,000
Their high energy makes gamma rays a form of ionizing radiation,

16
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:26,000
meaning they are energetic enough to break apart atomic bonds.

17
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:29,000
This makes them dangerous to you and me.

18
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:36,000
Ionizing radiation disrupts the delicate biochemical machinery that keeps us alive like a 9mm bullet through a clock.

19
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:42,000
Fortunately, on Earth, the ozone layer blocks gamma rays, filtering them out before they can harm us.

20
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:49,000
But if the atmosphere blocks gamma rays from space, how were gamma-ray bursts or GRBs from space ever discovered?

21
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:56,000
During the Cold War, the USA sent up spy satellites which could detect gamma rays from Soviet nuclear tests in space.

22
00:01:56,000 --> 00:02:04,000
They didn't see any bombs, but they did observe faint bursts coming from space, lasting only a few seconds.

23
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:11,000
To date, this may be the only major scientific discovery made by spy satellites, that we know about anyway.

24
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:16,000
Astronomers use telescopes that see different kinds of light to make their discoveries,

25
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:19,000
and these spy satellites gave them a new pair of eyes.

26
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:27,000
They were a mystery for 30 years, but eventually we discovered the source of a GRB, a galaxy 6 billion light years away.

27
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:32,000
If a GRB can be seen from such a distance, then it must be incredibly energetic,

28
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:38,000
releasing more energy in a second than the Sun will in its entire 10 billion year lifetime,

29
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:42,000
making GRBs the brightest events in the universe.

30
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,000
So, where do they come from?

31
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:52,000
GRBs accompany some of the most violent cataclysmic deaths in the universe and the birth of black holes.

32
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:58,000
There are two types of gamma-ray bursts, short and long, and each has their own source.

33
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:03,000
Long GRBs last about a minute, and scientists think they are produced by supernova,

34
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:06,000
when the core of a massive star collapses to become a black hole.

35
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:12,000
Short GRBs last a second, and are produced when two neutron stars in a binary merge.

36
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:17,000
Over millions of years, their orbits decay by emitting gravitational waves.

37
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:22,000
Once they are close enough to touch, they crash and splash into each other, forming a black hole.

38
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:26,000
Both supernova and neutron star mergers make the same thing,

39
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:32,000
black holes surrounded by a magnetized disk of gas left over from their parent stars.

40
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:36,000
In these environments, the rotation winds up the magnetic field,

41
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:40,000
which funnels hot jets of particles traveling at maybe the speed of light.

42
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:46,000
The gas in this funnel creates two tight jets of high-energy gamma rays, like a celestial laser gun.

43
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:50,000
So, unlike other cosmic explosions, which spread out and fade,

44
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:54,000
GRBs stay focused and can be seen from much further.

45
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:59,000
Any more detail would require too much mathematics for a YouTube video.

46
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:05,000
The universe is full of these cosmic snipers, firing blindly and randomly into the dark,

47
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:07,000
and they are hitting us all the time.

48
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:13,000
On average, we detect one per day. Fortunately, most are harmless.

49
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:19,000
All the bursts we have detected so far originated outside the Milky Way, too far away to hurt us.

50
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:22,000
But a nearby GRB could be disastrous.

51
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:27,000
If one goes off within a few light-years of us, it would totally cook the surface of the Earth,

52
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:29,000
or at least the half that's facing it.

53
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:33,000
But even a more distant GRB could still end life on Earth.

54
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:36,000
And it wouldn't need to score a headshot to kill us.

55
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:42,000
If originating from a few thousand light-years away, it would be a hundred light-years wide by the time it reaches us,

56
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:46,000
washing over the solar system like a tidal wave.

57
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:52,000
Again, the ozone layer protects us, but it's better equipped to handle the trickle of ultraviolet from the Sun.

58
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:57,000
A gamma-ray burst would overwhelm it, leaving us exposed to deadly solar radiation.

59
00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:01,000
Ozone takes years to replenish itself by natural processes,

60
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:08,000
which is more than enough time for the Sun to burn the Earth sterile, or at least to kill most complex life.

61
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:11,000
In fact, this may have already happened.

62
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:18,000
A GRB has been suggested as one possible cause of the Ordovician extinction 450 million years ago,

63
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:24,000
that eradicated almost 85% of all marine species, although it's pretty much impossible to prove.

64
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:29,000
Gamma-ray bursts could even be one reason we don't see life anywhere else in the universe.

65
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:34,000
They might be wiping clean huge chunks of it on a regular basis.

66
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:42,000
It's been suggested that because of GRBs, only 10% of all galaxies might be hospitable to life similar to us.

67
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:46,000
So, are they going to kill us? Probably not.

68
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:54,000
In a galaxy like ours, there may only be one GRB per millennia, and to harm us, they must be close and directed at us.

69
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:59,000
But since gamma-rays travel at the speed of light, we won't know when it's headed our way until it arrives.

70
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:06,000
So there could already be a GRB on its way to kill us all, and we won't know it until it hits us, and we're dead.
