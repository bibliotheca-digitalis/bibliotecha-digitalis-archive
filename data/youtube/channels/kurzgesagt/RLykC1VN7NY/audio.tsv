0	5500	Imagine if you could gather the energy from every star within a hundred million light-years,
5500	10000	from thousands of galaxies, each with billions of stars.
10000	16000	Imagine you could take this kind of power and use it to fire the biggest super-weapon in the universe.
16000	19000	Imagine the damage you could do.
19000	26000	It turns out, you don't need to imagine it, these exist, and they're called gamma-ray bursts.
26000	28000	But what are these cosmic snipers?
28000	32000	And what happens if one takes a shot at Earth?
41000	46000	To understand gamma-ray bursts, we first have to understand gamma rays.
46000	52000	Gamma rays are electromagnetic radiation, waves which carry energy, just like visible light.
52000	58000	Visible light is a tiny part of the electromagnetic spectrum, it's the part your eyes can see.
58000	63000	At lower energies, there are radio waves, microwaves, and infrared.
63000	68000	And at higher energies, ultraviolet, x-rays, and gamma rays.
68000	71000	Gamma rays are incredibly powerful.
71000	77000	A single gamma-ray photon is more energetic than a million visible photons combined.
77000	81000	Their high energy makes gamma rays a form of ionizing radiation,
81000	86000	meaning they are energetic enough to break apart atomic bonds.
86000	89000	This makes them dangerous to you and me.
89000	96000	Ionizing radiation disrupts the delicate biochemical machinery that keeps us alive like a 9mm bullet through a clock.
96000	102000	Fortunately, on Earth, the ozone layer blocks gamma rays, filtering them out before they can harm us.
102000	109000	But if the atmosphere blocks gamma rays from space, how were gamma-ray bursts or GRBs from space ever discovered?
109000	116000	During the Cold War, the USA sent up spy satellites which could detect gamma rays from Soviet nuclear tests in space.
116000	124000	They didn't see any bombs, but they did observe faint bursts coming from space, lasting only a few seconds.
124000	131000	To date, this may be the only major scientific discovery made by spy satellites, that we know about anyway.
131000	136000	Astronomers use telescopes that see different kinds of light to make their discoveries,
136000	139000	and these spy satellites gave them a new pair of eyes.
139000	147000	They were a mystery for 30 years, but eventually we discovered the source of a GRB, a galaxy 6 billion light years away.
147000	152000	If a GRB can be seen from such a distance, then it must be incredibly energetic,
152000	158000	releasing more energy in a second than the Sun will in its entire 10 billion year lifetime,
158000	162000	making GRBs the brightest events in the universe.
162000	164000	So, where do they come from?
165000	172000	GRBs accompany some of the most violent cataclysmic deaths in the universe and the birth of black holes.
172000	178000	There are two types of gamma-ray bursts, short and long, and each has their own source.
178000	183000	Long GRBs last about a minute, and scientists think they are produced by supernova,
183000	186000	when the core of a massive star collapses to become a black hole.
186000	192000	Short GRBs last a second, and are produced when two neutron stars in a binary merge.
192000	197000	Over millions of years, their orbits decay by emitting gravitational waves.
197000	202000	Once they are close enough to touch, they crash and splash into each other, forming a black hole.
202000	206000	Both supernova and neutron star mergers make the same thing,
206000	212000	black holes surrounded by a magnetized disk of gas left over from their parent stars.
212000	216000	In these environments, the rotation winds up the magnetic field,
216000	220000	which funnels hot jets of particles traveling at maybe the speed of light.
220000	226000	The gas in this funnel creates two tight jets of high-energy gamma rays, like a celestial laser gun.
226000	230000	So, unlike other cosmic explosions, which spread out and fade,
230000	234000	GRBs stay focused and can be seen from much further.
234000	239000	Any more detail would require too much mathematics for a YouTube video.
239000	245000	The universe is full of these cosmic snipers, firing blindly and randomly into the dark,
245000	247000	and they are hitting us all the time.
247000	253000	On average, we detect one per day. Fortunately, most are harmless.
253000	259000	All the bursts we have detected so far originated outside the Milky Way, too far away to hurt us.
259000	262000	But a nearby GRB could be disastrous.
262000	267000	If one goes off within a few light-years of us, it would totally cook the surface of the Earth,
267000	269000	or at least the half that's facing it.
269000	273000	But even a more distant GRB could still end life on Earth.
273000	276000	And it wouldn't need to score a headshot to kill us.
276000	282000	If originating from a few thousand light-years away, it would be a hundred light-years wide by the time it reaches us,
282000	286000	washing over the solar system like a tidal wave.
286000	292000	Again, the ozone layer protects us, but it's better equipped to handle the trickle of ultraviolet from the Sun.
292000	297000	A gamma-ray burst would overwhelm it, leaving us exposed to deadly solar radiation.
297000	301000	Ozone takes years to replenish itself by natural processes,
301000	308000	which is more than enough time for the Sun to burn the Earth sterile, or at least to kill most complex life.
308000	311000	In fact, this may have already happened.
311000	318000	A GRB has been suggested as one possible cause of the Ordovician extinction 450 million years ago,
318000	324000	that eradicated almost 85% of all marine species, although it's pretty much impossible to prove.
324000	329000	Gamma-ray bursts could even be one reason we don't see life anywhere else in the universe.
329000	334000	They might be wiping clean huge chunks of it on a regular basis.
334000	342000	It's been suggested that because of GRBs, only 10% of all galaxies might be hospitable to life similar to us.
342000	346000	So, are they going to kill us? Probably not.
346000	354000	In a galaxy like ours, there may only be one GRB per millennia, and to harm us, they must be close and directed at us.
354000	359000	But since gamma-rays travel at the speed of light, we won't know when it's headed our way until it arrives.
359000	366000	So there could already be a GRB on its way to kill us all, and we won't know it until it hits us, and we're dead.
