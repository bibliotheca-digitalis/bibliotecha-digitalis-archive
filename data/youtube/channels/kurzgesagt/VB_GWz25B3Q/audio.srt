00:00:00,960 --> 00:00:05,840
Here in the Kurzgesagt labs we only work on the most important scientific problems like

2
00:00:05,840 --> 00:00:11,440
what if we nuke stuff or how about we make this elephant explode or who could forget

3
00:00:11,440 --> 00:00:17,600
look at this thing it's really big continuing this proud tradition let's explore the scientific

4
00:00:17,600 --> 00:00:23,760
mystery of what would happen to you if earth suddenly turned into gold the midas apocalypse

5
00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:29,280
based on the ancient tale of king midas who was cursed so everything he touched turned into gold

6
00:00:30,160 --> 00:00:36,240
before we can explore this scenario with science we'll first define the premise midas's curse is a

7
00:00:36,240 --> 00:00:42,560
very special phenomenon called magic which allows us to modify physics so what happens

8
00:00:42,560 --> 00:00:57,600
when midas touches something and it turns to gold an atom of gold has 79 protons and 180 neutrons in

9
00:00:57,600 --> 00:01:03,120
its nucleus the electric force of the protons on the electrons around them shapes the atom

10
00:01:03,120 --> 00:01:07,920
and gives gold its chemical properties like that it doesn't rust and that it's kind of shiny and

11
00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:14,960
bending so to make not gold into gold we have to change atoms let's say midas touches a duck

12
00:01:15,600 --> 00:01:21,680
all the light elements like hydrogen carbon and oxygen gain electrons and protons and neutrons

13
00:01:21,680 --> 00:01:28,000
to become gold not only is the duck suddenly 33 times more massive it's also much too dense

14
00:01:28,800 --> 00:01:33,360
the gold atoms are far closer together than they like and repel each other violently

15
00:01:33,360 --> 00:01:39,360
causing the golden duck to explode with the energy of half a ton of tnt leaving only gold dust and a

16
00:01:39,360 --> 00:01:46,320
very dead midas this is clearly not a very good way for midas's power to work so what if instead

17
00:01:46,320 --> 00:01:52,160
midas's power uses the atoms that are already present and simply rearranges all particles in

18
00:01:52,160 --> 00:01:58,480
the matter he touches into gold no matter is created or destroyed instead atoms dissolve

19
00:01:58,480 --> 00:02:04,880
and the protons neutrons and electrons are reassembled to make gold however gold is very

20
00:02:04,880 --> 00:02:11,600
dense about 20 times denser than a duck without adding any matter the gold duck would be a very

21
00:02:11,600 --> 00:02:17,760
awkward kind of foamy gold with lots of tiny microscopic gaps this is funky and doesn't

22
00:02:17,760 --> 00:02:23,280
explode which is progress now that we've established a sort of magic that works

23
00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:31,040
what would happen if midas stumbles what if he touches earth itself let's freeze time for just

24
00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:37,360
a moment and rearrange all the matter in the earth just like the duck the earth is now solid gold but

25
00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:43,440
with many tiny atomic scale gaps while these gaps weren't a huge deal for the duck they're a big

26
00:02:43,440 --> 00:02:49,840
problem for the earth a spongy planet is not a thing that can exist as gravity compresses earth

27
00:02:49,840 --> 00:02:56,000
squeezing it together to close up the gaps as a result the earth contracts shrinking to two-thirds

28
00:02:56,000 --> 00:03:01,920
of its radius if you're standing on earth's surface you'll suddenly find yourself in freefall

29
00:03:01,920 --> 00:03:08,080
like on a roller coaster as the ground sinks away beneath you but since the ground is falling too it

30
00:03:08,080 --> 00:03:13,280
doesn't move away from you it feels like someone turned off gravity and you and everything else

31
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:19,120
would begin to float but the ride doesn't last forever it takes only 10 minutes for everything

32
00:03:19,120 --> 00:03:26,640
to crash down and a weird 10 minutes it is indeed and then as abruptly as it started it stops

33
00:03:26,640 --> 00:03:32,320
the collapsing earth has reached its desired size and gravity is suddenly turned back on for you

34
00:03:32,320 --> 00:03:37,120
hopefully you enjoyed your minutes of floating because the ground and you with it crash into

35
00:03:37,120 --> 00:03:43,120
the planet at 30 000 kilometers an hour making your body splatter like a water balloon as it hits

36
00:03:43,120 --> 00:03:49,200
in one instant basically all the humanity gets smashed into red puddles this is only the start

37
00:03:49,200 --> 00:03:55,040
of our problems though since earth imploded supersonically the kinetic energy of the implosion

38
00:03:55,040 --> 00:04:00,480
is basically equivalent to detonating a planet made of tnt crushed together under incredible

39
00:04:00,480 --> 00:04:06,720
forces earth's core reaches a million degrees celsius a temperature closer to the core of a

40
00:04:06,720 --> 00:04:12,560
star than anything we're used to finding on earth as the earth crashes into itself it generates an

41
00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:17,920
enormously powerful shock wave which plows upwards catapulting the atmosphere up and off

42
00:04:18,960 --> 00:04:24,160
the earth's surface temperature reaches hundreds of thousands of degrees and everything on it is

43
00:04:24,160 --> 00:04:31,040
instantly vaporized to a fluffy plasma cloud that starts to expand but not by much many of the

44
00:04:31,040 --> 00:04:36,400
atoms that may have been new get mixed into this cloud while others boil off escaping from the

45
00:04:36,400 --> 00:04:42,800
atmosphere the golden plasma outshines the sun while the enormous radiation lifts tons of

46
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:49,360
material off into space over the coming days the plasma cloud cools and eventually freezes into a

47
00:04:49,360 --> 00:04:57,760
shiny little golden ball okay maybe this type of magic doesn't work so if replacing atoms made the

48
00:04:57,760 --> 00:05:03,440
earth so overdense that it exploded and disassembling and reassembling atoms made the earth

49
00:05:03,440 --> 00:05:09,600
so under dense that it imploded there must be a sweet spot where the earth does neither what if

50
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:15,440
midas's power is such that an object is suddenly replaced by an object with the same volume made

51
00:05:15,440 --> 00:05:22,240
from solid gold that magic is a little bit more magic and cuts a few extra corners but let's see

52
00:05:22,240 --> 00:05:30,160
where this leads us so midas stumbles again even though our new pure gold earth is not expanding

53
00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:36,720
or contracting it's suddenly much more massive the density of gold is three and a half times

54
00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:42,720
greater than the earth meaning the earth is going to get three and a half times more massive for

55
00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:49,040
starters everyone now has to contend with surface gravity that is more than three times stronger so

56
00:05:49,040 --> 00:05:53,440
if you're not a champion weightlifter who's used to carrying around a few times your body weight

57
00:05:53,440 --> 00:05:57,760
on your shoulders you're probably going to be slammed to the ground by your own weight

58
00:05:58,960 --> 00:06:03,840
depending on where you were when earth turned into gold this alone could seriously hurt or even kill

59
00:06:03,840 --> 00:06:09,360
you trees and artificial structures collapse under stress they were never meant to sustain

60
00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:14,160
while birds and planes and all things that were able to fly or float splash to the ground all

61
00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:19,440
around you and you're not the only thing weighed down by the greater gravity the weight of the

62
00:06:19,440 --> 00:06:25,200
atmosphere and also atmospheric pressure nearly quadruples which is a bad thing if you like living

63
00:06:25,200 --> 00:06:30,080
on its own this won't kill you scuba divers can comfortably breathe air at these pressures for

64
00:06:30,080 --> 00:06:35,680
a while but unfortunately squeezing the atmosphere this much raises its temperature to 150 degrees

65
00:06:35,680 --> 00:06:42,320
celsius which is like the insides of an oven the entire earth's surface bakes roasting anything and

66
00:06:42,320 --> 00:06:48,960
everything there is no escape gold may be a metal but it's about three times weaker than steel

67
00:06:48,960 --> 00:06:54,400
and also very malleable which makes it very bad mountain material the tallest mountains that can

68
00:06:54,400 --> 00:07:00,000
be supported are now only about two kilometers high so whole ranges compress as their own weight

69
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:05,920
basically crushes their base it's hard to say what happens here we're probably in for giant

70
00:07:05,920 --> 00:07:10,720
earthquakes and landslides as the planet is squeezed into a new shape and it's not just

71
00:07:10,720 --> 00:07:15,520
mountain ranges the differences between the continents and the ocean floor level out causing

72
00:07:15,520 --> 00:07:22,160
the ocean basins to overflow sending massive tidal waves over the earth's surface what remains is a

73
00:07:22,160 --> 00:07:28,480
planet made of gold entirely covered by an ocean three kilometers deep a super hot atmosphere and

74
00:07:28,480 --> 00:07:36,800
a lot of dead people hmm okay there may be a lesson to take away here but we're not sure what

75
00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:42,160
it is we did all the maths though it's in our sources document if you want to take a look if

76
00:07:42,160 --> 00:07:48,800
you learned anything in this video let us know what it was so as you might know the things we

77
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:53,680
sell in our shop are the reason we're able to publish videos for free but it's way more than

78
00:07:53,680 --> 00:08:00,880
that for us here's a short story and a making of a while ago we posted this image on social media

79
00:08:00,880 --> 00:08:06,400
just to post something nice looking immediately a lot of people were quite upset about it because

80
00:08:06,400 --> 00:08:13,040
it was wrong and you guys take what we put out that seriously so we deleted it and contacted

81
00:08:13,040 --> 00:08:19,280
experts to make something new and better we spent hundreds of hours on research and illustration

82
00:08:19,280 --> 00:08:26,240
and created this new extensive map of evolution a new visualization of the relationships between

83
00:08:26,240 --> 00:08:32,720
living things that didn't exist before and while this was obviously a lot of work and stress it

84
00:08:32,720 --> 00:08:39,120
sort of exemplifies why working on this channel is so satisfying because you people care and this

85
00:08:39,120 --> 00:08:45,920
makes us work harder and learn things we didn't know before so thank you for supporting our crazy

86
00:08:45,920 --> 00:08:52,800
ideas and our sometimes crazy merch because of you we can continue to release our videos for free

87
00:08:52,800 --> 00:08:59,680
for everyone and drop hundreds of hours into new concepts we are super grateful for that you can

88
00:08:59,680 --> 00:09:15,440
