00:00.960 --> 00:05.840
Here in the Kurzgesagt labs we only work on the most important scientific problems like

00:05.840 --> 00:11.440
what if we nuke stuff or how about we make this elephant explode or who could forget

00:11.440 --> 00:17.600
look at this thing it's really big continuing this proud tradition let's explore the scientific

00:17.600 --> 00:23.760
mystery of what would happen to you if earth suddenly turned into gold the midas apocalypse

00:23.760 --> 00:29.280
based on the ancient tale of king midas who was cursed so everything he touched turned into gold

00:30.160 --> 00:36.240
before we can explore this scenario with science we'll first define the premise midas's curse is a

00:36.240 --> 00:42.560
very special phenomenon called magic which allows us to modify physics so what happens

00:42.560 --> 00:57.600
when midas touches something and it turns to gold an atom of gold has 79 protons and 180 neutrons in

00:57.600 --> 01:03.120
its nucleus the electric force of the protons on the electrons around them shapes the atom

01:03.120 --> 01:07.920
and gives gold its chemical properties like that it doesn't rust and that it's kind of shiny and

01:07.920 --> 01:14.960
bending so to make not gold into gold we have to change atoms let's say midas touches a duck

01:15.600 --> 01:21.680
all the light elements like hydrogen carbon and oxygen gain electrons and protons and neutrons

01:21.680 --> 01:28.000
to become gold not only is the duck suddenly 33 times more massive it's also much too dense

01:28.800 --> 01:33.360
the gold atoms are far closer together than they like and repel each other violently

01:33.360 --> 01:39.360
causing the golden duck to explode with the energy of half a ton of tnt leaving only gold dust and a

01:39.360 --> 01:46.320
very dead midas this is clearly not a very good way for midas's power to work so what if instead

01:46.320 --> 01:52.160
midas's power uses the atoms that are already present and simply rearranges all particles in

01:52.160 --> 01:58.480
the matter he touches into gold no matter is created or destroyed instead atoms dissolve

01:58.480 --> 02:04.880
and the protons neutrons and electrons are reassembled to make gold however gold is very

02:04.880 --> 02:11.600
dense about 20 times denser than a duck without adding any matter the gold duck would be a very

02:11.600 --> 02:17.760
awkward kind of foamy gold with lots of tiny microscopic gaps this is funky and doesn't

02:17.760 --> 02:23.280
explode which is progress now that we've established a sort of magic that works

02:23.280 --> 02:31.040
what would happen if midas stumbles what if he touches earth itself let's freeze time for just

02:31.040 --> 02:37.360
a moment and rearrange all the matter in the earth just like the duck the earth is now solid gold but

02:37.360 --> 02:43.440
with many tiny atomic scale gaps while these gaps weren't a huge deal for the duck they're a big

02:43.440 --> 02:49.840
problem for the earth a spongy planet is not a thing that can exist as gravity compresses earth

02:49.840 --> 02:56.000
squeezing it together to close up the gaps as a result the earth contracts shrinking to two-thirds

02:56.000 --> 03:01.920
of its radius if you're standing on earth's surface you'll suddenly find yourself in freefall

03:01.920 --> 03:08.080
like on a roller coaster as the ground sinks away beneath you but since the ground is falling too it

03:08.080 --> 03:13.280
doesn't move away from you it feels like someone turned off gravity and you and everything else

03:13.280 --> 03:19.120
would begin to float but the ride doesn't last forever it takes only 10 minutes for everything

03:19.120 --> 03:26.640
to crash down and a weird 10 minutes it is indeed and then as abruptly as it started it stops

03:26.640 --> 03:32.320
the collapsing earth has reached its desired size and gravity is suddenly turned back on for you

03:32.320 --> 03:37.120
hopefully you enjoyed your minutes of floating because the ground and you with it crash into

03:37.120 --> 03:43.120
the planet at 30 000 kilometers an hour making your body splatter like a water balloon as it hits

03:43.120 --> 03:49.200
in one instant basically all the humanity gets smashed into red puddles this is only the start

03:49.200 --> 03:55.040
of our problems though since earth imploded supersonically the kinetic energy of the implosion

03:55.040 --> 04:00.480
is basically equivalent to detonating a planet made of tnt crushed together under incredible

04:00.480 --> 04:06.720
forces earth's core reaches a million degrees celsius a temperature closer to the core of a

04:06.720 --> 04:12.560
star than anything we're used to finding on earth as the earth crashes into itself it generates an

04:12.560 --> 04:17.920
enormously powerful shock wave which plows upwards catapulting the atmosphere up and off

04:18.960 --> 04:24.160
the earth's surface temperature reaches hundreds of thousands of degrees and everything on it is

04:24.160 --> 04:31.040
instantly vaporized to a fluffy plasma cloud that starts to expand but not by much many of the

04:31.040 --> 04:36.400
atoms that may have been new get mixed into this cloud while others boil off escaping from the

04:36.400 --> 04:42.800
atmosphere the golden plasma outshines the sun while the enormous radiation lifts tons of

04:42.800 --> 04:49.360
material off into space over the coming days the plasma cloud cools and eventually freezes into a

04:49.360 --> 04:57.760
shiny little golden ball okay maybe this type of magic doesn't work so if replacing atoms made the

04:57.760 --> 05:03.440
earth so overdense that it exploded and disassembling and reassembling atoms made the earth

05:03.440 --> 05:09.600
so under dense that it imploded there must be a sweet spot where the earth does neither what if

05:09.600 --> 05:15.440
midas's power is such that an object is suddenly replaced by an object with the same volume made

05:15.440 --> 05:22.240
from solid gold that magic is a little bit more magic and cuts a few extra corners but let's see

05:22.240 --> 05:30.160
where this leads us so midas stumbles again even though our new pure gold earth is not expanding

05:30.160 --> 05:36.720
or contracting it's suddenly much more massive the density of gold is three and a half times

05:36.720 --> 05:42.720
greater than the earth meaning the earth is going to get three and a half times more massive for

05:42.720 --> 05:49.040
starters everyone now has to contend with surface gravity that is more than three times stronger so

05:49.040 --> 05:53.440
if you're not a champion weightlifter who's used to carrying around a few times your body weight

05:53.440 --> 05:57.760
on your shoulders you're probably going to be slammed to the ground by your own weight

05:58.960 --> 06:03.840
depending on where you were when earth turned into gold this alone could seriously hurt or even kill

06:03.840 --> 06:09.360
you trees and artificial structures collapse under stress they were never meant to sustain

06:09.360 --> 06:14.160
while birds and planes and all things that were able to fly or float splash to the ground all

06:14.160 --> 06:19.440
around you and you're not the only thing weighed down by the greater gravity the weight of the

06:19.440 --> 06:25.200
atmosphere and also atmospheric pressure nearly quadruples which is a bad thing if you like living

06:25.200 --> 06:30.080
on its own this won't kill you scuba divers can comfortably breathe air at these pressures for

06:30.080 --> 06:35.680
a while but unfortunately squeezing the atmosphere this much raises its temperature to 150 degrees

06:35.680 --> 06:42.320
celsius which is like the insides of an oven the entire earth's surface bakes roasting anything and

06:42.320 --> 06:48.960
everything there is no escape gold may be a metal but it's about three times weaker than steel

06:48.960 --> 06:54.400
and also very malleable which makes it very bad mountain material the tallest mountains that can

06:54.400 --> 07:00.000
be supported are now only about two kilometers high so whole ranges compress as their own weight

07:00.000 --> 07:05.920
basically crushes their base it's hard to say what happens here we're probably in for giant

07:05.920 --> 07:10.720
earthquakes and landslides as the planet is squeezed into a new shape and it's not just

07:10.720 --> 07:15.520
mountain ranges the differences between the continents and the ocean floor level out causing

07:15.520 --> 07:22.160
the ocean basins to overflow sending massive tidal waves over the earth's surface what remains is a

07:22.160 --> 07:28.480
planet made of gold entirely covered by an ocean three kilometers deep a super hot atmosphere and

07:28.480 --> 07:36.800
a lot of dead people hmm okay there may be a lesson to take away here but we're not sure what

07:36.800 --> 07:42.160
it is we did all the maths though it's in our sources document if you want to take a look if

07:42.160 --> 07:48.800
you learned anything in this video let us know what it was so as you might know the things we

07:48.800 --> 07:53.680
sell in our shop are the reason we're able to publish videos for free but it's way more than

07:53.680 --> 08:00.880
that for us here's a short story and a making of a while ago we posted this image on social media

08:00.880 --> 08:06.400
just to post something nice looking immediately a lot of people were quite upset about it because

08:06.400 --> 08:13.040
it was wrong and you guys take what we put out that seriously so we deleted it and contacted

08:13.040 --> 08:19.280
experts to make something new and better we spent hundreds of hours on research and illustration

08:19.280 --> 08:26.240
and created this new extensive map of evolution a new visualization of the relationships between

08:26.240 --> 08:32.720
living things that didn't exist before and while this was obviously a lot of work and stress it

08:32.720 --> 08:39.120
sort of exemplifies why working on this channel is so satisfying because you people care and this

08:39.120 --> 08:45.920
makes us work harder and learn things we didn't know before so thank you for supporting our crazy

08:45.920 --> 08:52.800
ideas and our sometimes crazy merch because of you we can continue to release our videos for free

08:52.800 --> 08:59.680
for everyone and drop hundreds of hours into new concepts we are super grateful for that you can

08:59.680 --> 09:15.440
