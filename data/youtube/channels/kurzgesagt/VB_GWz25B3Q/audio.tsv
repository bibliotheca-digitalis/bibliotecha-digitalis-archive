960	5840	Here in the Kurzgesagt labs we only work on the most important scientific problems like
5840	11440	what if we nuke stuff or how about we make this elephant explode or who could forget
11440	17600	look at this thing it's really big continuing this proud tradition let's explore the scientific
17600	23760	mystery of what would happen to you if earth suddenly turned into gold the midas apocalypse
23760	29280	based on the ancient tale of king midas who was cursed so everything he touched turned into gold
30160	36240	before we can explore this scenario with science we'll first define the premise midas's curse is a
36240	42560	very special phenomenon called magic which allows us to modify physics so what happens
42560	57600	when midas touches something and it turns to gold an atom of gold has 79 protons and 180 neutrons in
57600	63120	its nucleus the electric force of the protons on the electrons around them shapes the atom
63120	67920	and gives gold its chemical properties like that it doesn't rust and that it's kind of shiny and
67920	74960	bending so to make not gold into gold we have to change atoms let's say midas touches a duck
75600	81680	all the light elements like hydrogen carbon and oxygen gain electrons and protons and neutrons
81680	88000	to become gold not only is the duck suddenly 33 times more massive it's also much too dense
88800	93360	the gold atoms are far closer together than they like and repel each other violently
93360	99360	causing the golden duck to explode with the energy of half a ton of tnt leaving only gold dust and a
99360	106320	very dead midas this is clearly not a very good way for midas's power to work so what if instead
106320	112160	midas's power uses the atoms that are already present and simply rearranges all particles in
112160	118480	the matter he touches into gold no matter is created or destroyed instead atoms dissolve
118480	124880	and the protons neutrons and electrons are reassembled to make gold however gold is very
124880	131600	dense about 20 times denser than a duck without adding any matter the gold duck would be a very
131600	137760	awkward kind of foamy gold with lots of tiny microscopic gaps this is funky and doesn't
137760	143280	explode which is progress now that we've established a sort of magic that works
143280	151040	what would happen if midas stumbles what if he touches earth itself let's freeze time for just
151040	157360	a moment and rearrange all the matter in the earth just like the duck the earth is now solid gold but
157360	163440	with many tiny atomic scale gaps while these gaps weren't a huge deal for the duck they're a big
163440	169840	problem for the earth a spongy planet is not a thing that can exist as gravity compresses earth
169840	176000	squeezing it together to close up the gaps as a result the earth contracts shrinking to two-thirds
176000	181920	of its radius if you're standing on earth's surface you'll suddenly find yourself in freefall
181920	188080	like on a roller coaster as the ground sinks away beneath you but since the ground is falling too it
188080	193280	doesn't move away from you it feels like someone turned off gravity and you and everything else
193280	199120	would begin to float but the ride doesn't last forever it takes only 10 minutes for everything
199120	206640	to crash down and a weird 10 minutes it is indeed and then as abruptly as it started it stops
206640	212320	the collapsing earth has reached its desired size and gravity is suddenly turned back on for you
212320	217120	hopefully you enjoyed your minutes of floating because the ground and you with it crash into
217120	223120	the planet at 30 000 kilometers an hour making your body splatter like a water balloon as it hits
223120	229200	in one instant basically all the humanity gets smashed into red puddles this is only the start
229200	235040	of our problems though since earth imploded supersonically the kinetic energy of the implosion
235040	240480	is basically equivalent to detonating a planet made of tnt crushed together under incredible
240480	246720	forces earth's core reaches a million degrees celsius a temperature closer to the core of a
246720	252560	star than anything we're used to finding on earth as the earth crashes into itself it generates an
252560	257920	enormously powerful shock wave which plows upwards catapulting the atmosphere up and off
258960	264160	the earth's surface temperature reaches hundreds of thousands of degrees and everything on it is
264160	271040	instantly vaporized to a fluffy plasma cloud that starts to expand but not by much many of the
271040	276400	atoms that may have been new get mixed into this cloud while others boil off escaping from the
276400	282800	atmosphere the golden plasma outshines the sun while the enormous radiation lifts tons of
282800	289360	material off into space over the coming days the plasma cloud cools and eventually freezes into a
289360	297760	shiny little golden ball okay maybe this type of magic doesn't work so if replacing atoms made the
297760	303440	earth so overdense that it exploded and disassembling and reassembling atoms made the earth
303440	309600	so under dense that it imploded there must be a sweet spot where the earth does neither what if
309600	315440	midas's power is such that an object is suddenly replaced by an object with the same volume made
315440	322240	from solid gold that magic is a little bit more magic and cuts a few extra corners but let's see
322240	330160	where this leads us so midas stumbles again even though our new pure gold earth is not expanding
330160	336720	or contracting it's suddenly much more massive the density of gold is three and a half times
336720	342720	greater than the earth meaning the earth is going to get three and a half times more massive for
342720	349040	starters everyone now has to contend with surface gravity that is more than three times stronger so
349040	353440	if you're not a champion weightlifter who's used to carrying around a few times your body weight
353440	357760	on your shoulders you're probably going to be slammed to the ground by your own weight
358960	363840	depending on where you were when earth turned into gold this alone could seriously hurt or even kill
363840	369360	you trees and artificial structures collapse under stress they were never meant to sustain
369360	374160	while birds and planes and all things that were able to fly or float splash to the ground all
374160	379440	around you and you're not the only thing weighed down by the greater gravity the weight of the
379440	385200	atmosphere and also atmospheric pressure nearly quadruples which is a bad thing if you like living
385200	390080	on its own this won't kill you scuba divers can comfortably breathe air at these pressures for
390080	395680	a while but unfortunately squeezing the atmosphere this much raises its temperature to 150 degrees
395680	402320	celsius which is like the insides of an oven the entire earth's surface bakes roasting anything and
402320	408960	everything there is no escape gold may be a metal but it's about three times weaker than steel
408960	414400	and also very malleable which makes it very bad mountain material the tallest mountains that can
414400	420000	be supported are now only about two kilometers high so whole ranges compress as their own weight
420000	425920	basically crushes their base it's hard to say what happens here we're probably in for giant
425920	430720	earthquakes and landslides as the planet is squeezed into a new shape and it's not just
430720	435520	mountain ranges the differences between the continents and the ocean floor level out causing
435520	442160	the ocean basins to overflow sending massive tidal waves over the earth's surface what remains is a
442160	448480	planet made of gold entirely covered by an ocean three kilometers deep a super hot atmosphere and
448480	456800	a lot of dead people hmm okay there may be a lesson to take away here but we're not sure what
456800	462160	it is we did all the maths though it's in our sources document if you want to take a look if
462160	468800	you learned anything in this video let us know what it was so as you might know the things we
468800	473680	sell in our shop are the reason we're able to publish videos for free but it's way more than
473680	480880	that for us here's a short story and a making of a while ago we posted this image on social media
480880	486400	just to post something nice looking immediately a lot of people were quite upset about it because
486400	493040	it was wrong and you guys take what we put out that seriously so we deleted it and contacted
493040	499280	experts to make something new and better we spent hundreds of hours on research and illustration
499280	506240	and created this new extensive map of evolution a new visualization of the relationships between
506240	512720	living things that didn't exist before and while this was obviously a lot of work and stress it
512720	519120	sort of exemplifies why working on this channel is so satisfying because you people care and this
519120	525920	makes us work harder and learn things we didn't know before so thank you for supporting our crazy
525920	532800	ideas and our sometimes crazy merch because of you we can continue to release our videos for free
532800	539680	for everyone and drop hundreds of hours into new concepts we are super grateful for that you can
539680	555440	check out the new evolution poster among many other things made with love in our shop
