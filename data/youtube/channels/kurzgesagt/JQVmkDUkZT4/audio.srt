1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,800
Are you your body? Well, kind of, right? But is there a line where this stops being true?

2
00:00:08,800 --> 00:00:13,380
How much of yourself can you remove before you stop being you?

3
00:00:13,380 --> 00:00:26,320
And does the question even make sense?

4
00:00:26,320 --> 00:00:31,640
Your physical existence is cells, trillions of them, at least ten times more than there

5
00:00:31,640 --> 00:00:38,800
are stars in the Milky Way. A cell is a living being, a machine made of up to 50,000 different

6
00:00:38,800 --> 00:00:46,040
proteins. It has no consciousness, no will, no purpose, it just is. But it is still an

7
00:00:46,040 --> 00:00:52,600
individual. Together, your cells form huge structures for jobs like preparing food, gathering

8
00:00:52,600 --> 00:00:59,020
resources, transporting stuff around, scanning the environment, and so on. If you extract

9
00:00:59,020 --> 00:01:03,580
cells from your body and put them in the right environment, they will continue to stay alive

10
00:01:03,580 --> 00:01:11,260
for a while. So, your cells can exist without you. But you can't exist without them. If

11
00:01:11,260 --> 00:01:17,520
we take all the cells away, there is no you anymore. Is there a line where a pile of your

12
00:01:17,520 --> 00:01:23,500
cells stops being you? For example, if you donate an organ, billions of your cells will

13
00:01:23,500 --> 00:01:28,720
continue to live on inside someone else. Does this mean that a part of you became a part

14
00:01:28,720 --> 00:01:35,940
of another person? Or, is this other body keeping a part of you alive? Or let us imagine

15
00:01:35,940 --> 00:01:42,120
an experiment. You and a random person from the street exchange cells. One at a time,

16
00:01:42,120 --> 00:01:46,940
your body gets one of their cells, their body gets one of your cells, at which point would

17
00:01:46,940 --> 00:01:53,200
they become you? Would they ever? Or is this just a very slow and gross way to teleport

18
00:01:53,200 --> 00:02:00,320
you? Let's make this more complicated. The image of ourselves as a static thing is untenable.

19
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:06,420
Almost all of your cells have to die during your lifetime. 250 million have died since

20
00:02:06,420 --> 00:02:13,280
the beginning of this video alone. Between one and three million per second. In a seven

21
00:02:13,280 --> 00:02:19,840
year period, most of your cells are replaced at least once. Every time your cell set up

22
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:26,420
changes, you are slightly different than before. So a part of you is dying constantly. If you

23
00:02:26,420 --> 00:02:32,760
are lucky enough to become old, you will have cycled through roughly a million billion cells.

24
00:02:32,760 --> 00:02:39,400
So what you consider yourself is really just a snapshot. But sometimes cells are broken

25
00:02:39,400 --> 00:02:44,260
and don't want to die, questioning the very nature of the unity of our bodies. We call

26
00:02:44,260 --> 00:02:51,680
them cancer. They cancel the biological social contract and become basically immortal. Cancer

27
00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:57,140
is not an outside invader. It's a part of you that puts its own survival over yours.

28
00:02:57,140 --> 00:03:01,440
But you could also argue that a cancer cell becomes another entity inside us. Another

29
00:03:01,440 --> 00:03:07,200
being that just wants to thrive and survive. Can we blame it for that? A chilling cell

30
00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:13,440
story is that of Henrietta Lacks, a young cancer patient who died in 1951. Usually,

31
00:03:13,440 --> 00:03:18,920
cells only survived for a few days in the lab, making research very hard. Henrietta's

32
00:03:18,920 --> 00:03:23,800
cancer cells were immortal. Over the decades, they were multiplied over and over again and

33
00:03:23,800 --> 00:03:29,640
used for countless research projects, saving countless lives. Henrietta's cells are still

34
00:03:29,640 --> 00:03:35,560
alive and overall have been grown to at least 20 tons of biomass. So there are living parts

35
00:03:35,560 --> 00:03:41,000
around the world from someone who has been considered dead for decades. How much of Henrietta

36
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:48,560
is in these cells? What makes one of your cells you anyway? Maybe the information contained

37
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:54,320
in it, your DNA. Until recently, it was believed that all the cells in your body had basically

38
00:03:54,320 --> 00:04:01,700
the same genetic code. But it turns out this is wrong. Your genome is mobile, changing

39
00:04:01,700 --> 00:04:06,860
over time through mutations and environmental influences. This is especially the case in your

40
00:04:06,860 --> 00:04:12,940
brain. According to recent discoveries, a single neuron in an adult brain has more than 1,000

41
00:04:12,940 --> 00:04:18,540
mutations in its genetic code that are not present in the cells surrounding it. But how much you is

42
00:04:18,540 --> 00:04:25,020
your DNA really? About 8% of the human genome is made up of viruses that once infected our

43
00:04:25,020 --> 00:04:31,580
ancestors and merged with us. Mitochondria, power plants of the cell, once were bacteria that merged

44
00:04:31,580 --> 00:04:38,820
with the ancestors of your cells. They still have their own DNA. An average cell has hundreds of

45
00:04:38,820 --> 00:04:44,700
them, hundreds of little things that are not really human, but they still kind of are. It is

46
00:04:44,700 --> 00:04:50,740
confusing. Let's backtrack a bit. We know that you're made up of trillions of little things,

47
00:04:50,740 --> 00:04:56,380
made from more little things that are constantly changing. Together, all those little things are

48
00:04:56,380 --> 00:05:03,140
not static but dynamic. Their composition and condition is changing constantly. So we might

49
00:05:03,140 --> 00:05:08,740
just be a self-sustaining pattern without clear borders that gained self-awareness at some point

50
00:05:08,740 --> 00:05:14,220
and now has the ability to think about itself through time and space, but really only exists

51
00:05:14,220 --> 00:05:21,860
in this exact very moment. Where did this pattern start? With your conception? When the first human

52
00:05:21,860 --> 00:05:27,860
arose? When life first began conquering our small planet? Or when the elements that make up your

53
00:05:27,860 --> 00:05:34,400
body were forged in a star? Our human brains evolved to deal with absolutes. The fuzzy borders

54
00:05:34,400 --> 00:05:41,580
that make up reality are hard to grasp. Maybe ideas like beginning and end, life and death,

55
00:05:41,580 --> 00:05:49,280
you and me, are really not absolutes, but ideas belonging to a fluent pattern. A pattern that is

56
00:05:49,280 --> 00:05:57,840
lost in this strange and beautiful universe. The problem of who we are isn't just a question of

57
00:05:57,840 --> 00:06:03,800
our cells, but it's also a question of our minds. Just as our cells can be divided and separated

58
00:06:03,800 --> 00:06:10,320
from us, so can our very brains be divided and separated from us while still in the skull. Click
