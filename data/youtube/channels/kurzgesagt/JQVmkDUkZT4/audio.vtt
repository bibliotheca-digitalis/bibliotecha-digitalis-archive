00:00.000 --> 00:08.800
Are you your body? Well, kind of, right? But is there a line where this stops being true?

00:08.800 --> 00:13.380
How much of yourself can you remove before you stop being you?

00:13.380 --> 00:26.320
And does the question even make sense?

00:26.320 --> 00:31.640
Your physical existence is cells, trillions of them, at least ten times more than there

00:31.640 --> 00:38.800
are stars in the Milky Way. A cell is a living being, a machine made of up to 50,000 different

00:38.800 --> 00:46.040
proteins. It has no consciousness, no will, no purpose, it just is. But it is still an

00:46.040 --> 00:52.600
individual. Together, your cells form huge structures for jobs like preparing food, gathering

00:52.600 --> 00:59.020
resources, transporting stuff around, scanning the environment, and so on. If you extract

00:59.020 --> 01:03.580
cells from your body and put them in the right environment, they will continue to stay alive

01:03.580 --> 01:11.260
for a while. So, your cells can exist without you. But you can't exist without them. If

01:11.260 --> 01:17.520
we take all the cells away, there is no you anymore. Is there a line where a pile of your

01:17.520 --> 01:23.500
cells stops being you? For example, if you donate an organ, billions of your cells will

01:23.500 --> 01:28.720
continue to live on inside someone else. Does this mean that a part of you became a part

01:28.720 --> 01:35.940
of another person? Or, is this other body keeping a part of you alive? Or let us imagine

01:35.940 --> 01:42.120
an experiment. You and a random person from the street exchange cells. One at a time,

01:42.120 --> 01:46.940
your body gets one of their cells, their body gets one of your cells, at which point would

01:46.940 --> 01:53.200
they become you? Would they ever? Or is this just a very slow and gross way to teleport

01:53.200 --> 02:00.320
you? Let's make this more complicated. The image of ourselves as a static thing is untenable.

02:00.320 --> 02:06.420
Almost all of your cells have to die during your lifetime. 250 million have died since

02:06.420 --> 02:13.280
the beginning of this video alone. Between one and three million per second. In a seven

02:13.280 --> 02:19.840
year period, most of your cells are replaced at least once. Every time your cell set up

02:19.840 --> 02:26.420
changes, you are slightly different than before. So a part of you is dying constantly. If you

02:26.420 --> 02:32.760
are lucky enough to become old, you will have cycled through roughly a million billion cells.

02:32.760 --> 02:39.400
So what you consider yourself is really just a snapshot. But sometimes cells are broken

02:39.400 --> 02:44.260
and don't want to die, questioning the very nature of the unity of our bodies. We call

02:44.260 --> 02:51.680
them cancer. They cancel the biological social contract and become basically immortal. Cancer

02:51.680 --> 02:57.140
is not an outside invader. It's a part of you that puts its own survival over yours.

02:57.140 --> 03:01.440
But you could also argue that a cancer cell becomes another entity inside us. Another

03:01.440 --> 03:07.200
being that just wants to thrive and survive. Can we blame it for that? A chilling cell

03:07.200 --> 03:13.440
story is that of Henrietta Lacks, a young cancer patient who died in 1951. Usually,

03:13.440 --> 03:18.920
cells only survived for a few days in the lab, making research very hard. Henrietta's

03:18.920 --> 03:23.800
cancer cells were immortal. Over the decades, they were multiplied over and over again and

03:23.800 --> 03:29.640
used for countless research projects, saving countless lives. Henrietta's cells are still

03:29.640 --> 03:35.560
alive and overall have been grown to at least 20 tons of biomass. So there are living parts

03:35.560 --> 03:41.000
around the world from someone who has been considered dead for decades. How much of Henrietta

03:41.000 --> 03:48.560
is in these cells? What makes one of your cells you anyway? Maybe the information contained

03:48.560 --> 03:54.320
in it, your DNA. Until recently, it was believed that all the cells in your body had basically

03:54.320 --> 04:01.700
the same genetic code. But it turns out this is wrong. Your genome is mobile, changing

04:01.700 --> 04:06.860
over time through mutations and environmental influences. This is especially the case in your

04:06.860 --> 04:12.940
brain. According to recent discoveries, a single neuron in an adult brain has more than 1,000

04:12.940 --> 04:18.540
mutations in its genetic code that are not present in the cells surrounding it. But how much you is

04:18.540 --> 04:25.020
your DNA really? About 8% of the human genome is made up of viruses that once infected our

04:25.020 --> 04:31.580
ancestors and merged with us. Mitochondria, power plants of the cell, once were bacteria that merged

04:31.580 --> 04:38.820
with the ancestors of your cells. They still have their own DNA. An average cell has hundreds of

04:38.820 --> 04:44.700
them, hundreds of little things that are not really human, but they still kind of are. It is

04:44.700 --> 04:50.740
confusing. Let's backtrack a bit. We know that you're made up of trillions of little things,

04:50.740 --> 04:56.380
made from more little things that are constantly changing. Together, all those little things are

04:56.380 --> 05:03.140
not static but dynamic. Their composition and condition is changing constantly. So we might

05:03.140 --> 05:08.740
just be a self-sustaining pattern without clear borders that gained self-awareness at some point

05:08.740 --> 05:14.220
and now has the ability to think about itself through time and space, but really only exists

05:14.220 --> 05:21.860
in this exact very moment. Where did this pattern start? With your conception? When the first human

05:21.860 --> 05:27.860
arose? When life first began conquering our small planet? Or when the elements that make up your

05:27.860 --> 05:34.400
body were forged in a star? Our human brains evolved to deal with absolutes. The fuzzy borders

05:34.400 --> 05:41.580
that make up reality are hard to grasp. Maybe ideas like beginning and end, life and death,

05:41.580 --> 05:49.280
you and me, are really not absolutes, but ideas belonging to a fluent pattern. A pattern that is

05:49.280 --> 05:57.840
lost in this strange and beautiful universe. The problem of who we are isn't just a question of

05:57.840 --> 06:03.800
our cells, but it's also a question of our minds. Just as our cells can be divided and separated

06:03.800 --> 06:10.320
from us, so can our very brains be divided and separated from us while still in the skull. Click

not yet subscribed to his channel, you should really change that now.
