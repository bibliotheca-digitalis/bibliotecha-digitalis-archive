0	8800	Are you your body? Well, kind of, right? But is there a line where this stops being true?
8800	13380	How much of yourself can you remove before you stop being you?
13380	26320	And does the question even make sense?
26320	31640	Your physical existence is cells, trillions of them, at least ten times more than there
31640	38800	are stars in the Milky Way. A cell is a living being, a machine made of up to 50,000 different
38800	46040	proteins. It has no consciousness, no will, no purpose, it just is. But it is still an
46040	52600	individual. Together, your cells form huge structures for jobs like preparing food, gathering
52600	59020	resources, transporting stuff around, scanning the environment, and so on. If you extract
59020	63580	cells from your body and put them in the right environment, they will continue to stay alive
63580	71260	for a while. So, your cells can exist without you. But you can't exist without them. If
71260	77520	we take all the cells away, there is no you anymore. Is there a line where a pile of your
77520	83500	cells stops being you? For example, if you donate an organ, billions of your cells will
83500	88720	continue to live on inside someone else. Does this mean that a part of you became a part
88720	95940	of another person? Or, is this other body keeping a part of you alive? Or let us imagine
95940	102120	an experiment. You and a random person from the street exchange cells. One at a time,
102120	106940	your body gets one of their cells, their body gets one of your cells, at which point would
106940	113200	they become you? Would they ever? Or is this just a very slow and gross way to teleport
113200	120320	you? Let's make this more complicated. The image of ourselves as a static thing is untenable.
120320	126420	Almost all of your cells have to die during your lifetime. 250 million have died since
126420	133280	the beginning of this video alone. Between one and three million per second. In a seven
133280	139840	year period, most of your cells are replaced at least once. Every time your cell set up
139840	146420	changes, you are slightly different than before. So a part of you is dying constantly. If you
146420	152760	are lucky enough to become old, you will have cycled through roughly a million billion cells.
152760	159400	So what you consider yourself is really just a snapshot. But sometimes cells are broken
159400	164260	and don't want to die, questioning the very nature of the unity of our bodies. We call
164260	171680	them cancer. They cancel the biological social contract and become basically immortal. Cancer
171680	177140	is not an outside invader. It's a part of you that puts its own survival over yours.
177140	181440	But you could also argue that a cancer cell becomes another entity inside us. Another
181440	187200	being that just wants to thrive and survive. Can we blame it for that? A chilling cell
187200	193440	story is that of Henrietta Lacks, a young cancer patient who died in 1951. Usually,
193440	198920	cells only survived for a few days in the lab, making research very hard. Henrietta's
198920	203800	cancer cells were immortal. Over the decades, they were multiplied over and over again and
203800	209640	used for countless research projects, saving countless lives. Henrietta's cells are still
209640	215560	alive and overall have been grown to at least 20 tons of biomass. So there are living parts
215560	221000	around the world from someone who has been considered dead for decades. How much of Henrietta
221000	228560	is in these cells? What makes one of your cells you anyway? Maybe the information contained
228560	234320	in it, your DNA. Until recently, it was believed that all the cells in your body had basically
234320	241700	the same genetic code. But it turns out this is wrong. Your genome is mobile, changing
241700	246860	over time through mutations and environmental influences. This is especially the case in your
246860	252940	brain. According to recent discoveries, a single neuron in an adult brain has more than 1,000
252940	258540	mutations in its genetic code that are not present in the cells surrounding it. But how much you is
258540	265020	your DNA really? About 8% of the human genome is made up of viruses that once infected our
265020	271580	ancestors and merged with us. Mitochondria, power plants of the cell, once were bacteria that merged
271580	278820	with the ancestors of your cells. They still have their own DNA. An average cell has hundreds of
278820	284700	them, hundreds of little things that are not really human, but they still kind of are. It is
284700	290740	confusing. Let's backtrack a bit. We know that you're made up of trillions of little things,
290740	296380	made from more little things that are constantly changing. Together, all those little things are
296380	303140	not static but dynamic. Their composition and condition is changing constantly. So we might
303140	308740	just be a self-sustaining pattern without clear borders that gained self-awareness at some point
308740	314220	and now has the ability to think about itself through time and space, but really only exists
314220	321860	in this exact very moment. Where did this pattern start? With your conception? When the first human
321860	327860	arose? When life first began conquering our small planet? Or when the elements that make up your
327860	334400	body were forged in a star? Our human brains evolved to deal with absolutes. The fuzzy borders
334400	341580	that make up reality are hard to grasp. Maybe ideas like beginning and end, life and death,
341580	349280	you and me, are really not absolutes, but ideas belonging to a fluent pattern. A pattern that is
349280	357840	lost in this strange and beautiful universe. The problem of who we are isn't just a question of
357840	363800	our cells, but it's also a question of our minds. Just as our cells can be divided and separated
363800	370320	from us, so can our very brains be divided and separated from us while still in the skull. Click
