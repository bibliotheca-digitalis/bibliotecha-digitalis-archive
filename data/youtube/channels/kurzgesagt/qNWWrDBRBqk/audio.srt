1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,600
In the year 1014, Byzantine Emperor Basil II defeated the Bulgarian army and captured

2
00:00:07,600 --> 00:00:09,600
15,000 prisoners.

3
00:00:09,600 --> 00:00:13,200
He could have killed them, but he had a different idea.

4
00:00:13,200 --> 00:00:17,040
He wanted to weaken his opponents for decades to come.

5
00:00:17,040 --> 00:00:24,020
So he ordered that 99 out of every 100 prisoners be blinded, the 100th to be spared one eye

6
00:00:24,020 --> 00:00:28,860
to guide the rest back home, forcing their communities to care for them for the rest

7
00:00:28,860 --> 00:00:30,580
of their lives.

8
00:00:30,580 --> 00:00:36,220
Today, humans are subject to an attack just as cynical as this by a league of supervillains

9
00:00:36,220 --> 00:00:39,780
called NTDs.

10
00:00:39,780 --> 00:00:44,900
One in seven humans on the planet suffers from one or more NTDs, more than the entire

11
00:00:44,900 --> 00:00:47,900
population of Europe.

12
00:00:47,900 --> 00:00:50,180
They do unimaginable damage.

13
00:00:50,180 --> 00:00:54,940
By crippling countless people, they destroy billions of dollars in income each year, weaken

14
00:00:54,940 --> 00:00:57,940
communities and slow progress.

15
00:00:58,020 --> 00:01:03,020
What are these monsters straight out of a horror movie, seeking to wreak havoc on our species?

16
00:01:13,020 --> 00:01:18,260
NTDs are caused by a vast range of different parasites such as worms, amoeba, bacteria

17
00:01:18,260 --> 00:01:19,980
or viruses.

18
00:01:19,980 --> 00:01:24,860
The symptoms they cause are just as diverse and truly the stuff of nightmares.

19
00:01:24,980 --> 00:01:30,340
Some, like hookworms, compete with children's brains and bodies for nutrition, stunting

20
00:01:30,340 --> 00:01:33,380
growth and impairing intelligence.

21
00:01:33,380 --> 00:01:37,840
Some NTDs cause blindness as a result of awful eye infections.

22
00:01:37,840 --> 00:01:43,260
Other parasites confine patients to bed for months and damage internal organs, often shortening

23
00:01:43,260 --> 00:01:45,540
lifespans drastically.

24
00:01:45,540 --> 00:01:50,460
Yet others cause horrible disfigurements that lead to social stigma, a life lived in shame

25
00:01:50,460 --> 00:01:52,340
and unemployment.

26
00:01:52,340 --> 00:01:55,140
There are also a few that are incredibly agonizing.

27
00:01:55,140 --> 00:01:59,060
They cause continuous itching or horrible pain.

28
00:01:59,060 --> 00:02:03,760
In fact, let's introduce you to one of them, dracunculiasis.

29
00:02:03,760 --> 00:02:08,780
If you accidentally drink water infected by it, you won't notice anything for a year,

30
00:02:08,780 --> 00:02:13,060
until one day you suddenly see a blister on your leg.

31
00:02:13,060 --> 00:02:16,700
The world breaks out of the skin to release new larvae.

32
00:02:16,700 --> 00:02:22,340
The only way to remove it is to slowly put it out of your leg, center by centimeter,

33
00:02:22,340 --> 00:02:27,880
over the course of several weeks, because dracunculiasis is now up to a meter long.

34
00:02:27,880 --> 00:02:31,220
We can all agree that we should kill such parasites with fire.

35
00:02:31,220 --> 00:02:36,460
That's why we declared war on them, pleading to eradicate most of them by 2020, and we

36
00:02:36,460 --> 00:02:38,940
tried doing that very hard.

37
00:02:38,940 --> 00:02:44,780
In 1985, there were 3.5 million cases of dracunculiasis all over the world.

38
00:02:44,780 --> 00:02:47,900
In 2015, there were 22.

39
00:02:47,900 --> 00:02:52,980
We killed 99.999% of these little monsters.

40
00:02:52,980 --> 00:02:57,420
It will be the first parasite we eradicate for good very soon.

41
00:02:57,420 --> 00:03:02,540
So even if they don't generate big headlines like Ebola did, actually, amazing things have

42
00:03:02,540 --> 00:03:05,500
happened when it comes to NTDs.

43
00:03:05,500 --> 00:03:07,860
All NTDs have one thing in common.

44
00:03:07,860 --> 00:03:11,860
They preferably attack humans who live in the most isolated communities and who are

45
00:03:11,860 --> 00:03:14,140
least able to defend themselves.

46
00:03:14,140 --> 00:03:18,180
There are villages that are 500 kilometers from the nearest health facility with no roads

47
00:03:18,180 --> 00:03:19,480
anywhere.

48
00:03:19,480 --> 00:03:23,660
So even if a remedy is available, what if it means going on an odyssey to get it to

49
00:03:23,660 --> 00:03:25,620
the patients?

50
00:03:25,620 --> 00:03:28,520
This called for an attack using brute force.

51
00:03:28,520 --> 00:03:33,140
To stamp out NTDs once and for all, what's possibly the biggest medical program in human

52
00:03:33,140 --> 00:03:37,220
history was launched unmatched in scale.

53
00:03:37,220 --> 00:03:41,580
Organizations from all fields are working together right now to eliminate 10 of these

54
00:03:41,580 --> 00:03:43,780
NTDs forever.

55
00:03:43,780 --> 00:03:48,500
Ironically, every NTD is in fact preventable or treatable.

56
00:03:48,500 --> 00:03:52,900
But most of them can only be controlled by giving medicine to every person in all high

57
00:03:52,900 --> 00:03:54,620
risk areas.

58
00:03:54,620 --> 00:03:59,820
That means millions and millions of doses of medicine, often for several NTDs at a time

59
00:03:59,820 --> 00:04:04,700
over the course of years in countries where there is no infrastructure.

60
00:04:04,700 --> 00:04:08,940
Governments and health organizations just couldn't do that by themselves.

61
00:04:09,340 --> 00:04:13,780
Here, humanity got an opportunity to show off what the industrialized production of

62
00:04:13,780 --> 00:04:15,820
medicine can achieve.

63
00:04:15,820 --> 00:04:20,200
The pharma industry stepped in to distribute the necessary drugs for free and promised

64
00:04:20,200 --> 00:04:24,080
to keep doing it until those 10 diseases are gone.

65
00:04:24,080 --> 00:04:29,980
By 2020, nearly $18 billion worth of drugs will have been distributed, the largest drug

66
00:04:29,980 --> 00:04:33,060
donation the world has ever seen.

67
00:04:33,060 --> 00:04:37,900
They also helped make sure the drugs actually get to where they're needed.

68
00:04:37,900 --> 00:04:43,560
In 2015 alone, these treatments reached over 815 million people, more than the population

69
00:04:43,560 --> 00:04:47,300
of the EU and the US combined.

70
00:04:47,300 --> 00:04:49,780
Bad things happening generates headlines.

71
00:04:49,780 --> 00:04:54,620
Hundreds of millions of people overcoming extremely destructive diseases in an unprecedented

72
00:04:54,620 --> 00:04:57,300
act of cooperation doesn't.

73
00:04:57,300 --> 00:05:00,340
Stories like this one are not told often enough.

74
00:05:00,340 --> 00:05:02,420
Good things happen all the time.

75
00:05:02,420 --> 00:05:06,220
Moving humanity closer to a future with no suffering.

76
00:05:06,220 --> 00:05:11,660
So if you or one of your friends are in need of uplifting news, share this video with them.

77
00:05:11,660 --> 00:05:16,700
We as a species really can do great things with no other motivation than to help each

78
00:05:16,700 --> 00:05:17,700
other.

79
00:05:17,700 --> 00:05:22,340
It's good to remember that from time to time.

80
00:05:22,340 --> 00:05:26,540

84
00:05:38,400 --> 00:05:39,880
the end of everything.
