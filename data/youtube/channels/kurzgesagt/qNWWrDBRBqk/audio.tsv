0	7600	In the year 1014, Byzantine Emperor Basil II defeated the Bulgarian army and captured
7600	9600	15,000 prisoners.
9600	13200	He could have killed them, but he had a different idea.
13200	17040	He wanted to weaken his opponents for decades to come.
17040	24020	So he ordered that 99 out of every 100 prisoners be blinded, the 100th to be spared one eye
24020	28860	to guide the rest back home, forcing their communities to care for them for the rest
28860	30580	of their lives.
30580	36220	Today, humans are subject to an attack just as cynical as this by a league of supervillains
36220	39780	called NTDs.
39780	44900	One in seven humans on the planet suffers from one or more NTDs, more than the entire
44900	47900	population of Europe.
47900	50180	They do unimaginable damage.
50180	54940	By crippling countless people, they destroy billions of dollars in income each year, weaken
54940	57940	communities and slow progress.
58020	63020	What are these monsters straight out of a horror movie, seeking to wreak havoc on our species?
73020	78260	NTDs are caused by a vast range of different parasites such as worms, amoeba, bacteria
78260	79980	or viruses.
79980	84860	The symptoms they cause are just as diverse and truly the stuff of nightmares.
84980	90340	Some, like hookworms, compete with children's brains and bodies for nutrition, stunting
90340	93380	growth and impairing intelligence.
93380	97840	Some NTDs cause blindness as a result of awful eye infections.
97840	103260	Other parasites confine patients to bed for months and damage internal organs, often shortening
103260	105540	lifespans drastically.
105540	110460	Yet others cause horrible disfigurements that lead to social stigma, a life lived in shame
110460	112340	and unemployment.
112340	115140	There are also a few that are incredibly agonizing.
115140	119060	They cause continuous itching or horrible pain.
119060	123760	In fact, let's introduce you to one of them, dracunculiasis.
123760	128780	If you accidentally drink water infected by it, you won't notice anything for a year,
128780	133060	until one day you suddenly see a blister on your leg.
133060	136700	The world breaks out of the skin to release new larvae.
136700	142340	The only way to remove it is to slowly put it out of your leg, center by centimeter,
142340	147880	over the course of several weeks, because dracunculiasis is now up to a meter long.
147880	151220	We can all agree that we should kill such parasites with fire.
151220	156460	That's why we declared war on them, pleading to eradicate most of them by 2020, and we
156460	158940	tried doing that very hard.
158940	164780	In 1985, there were 3.5 million cases of dracunculiasis all over the world.
164780	167900	In 2015, there were 22.
167900	172980	We killed 99.999% of these little monsters.
172980	177420	It will be the first parasite we eradicate for good very soon.
177420	182540	So even if they don't generate big headlines like Ebola did, actually, amazing things have
182540	185500	happened when it comes to NTDs.
185500	187860	All NTDs have one thing in common.
187860	191860	They preferably attack humans who live in the most isolated communities and who are
191860	194140	least able to defend themselves.
194140	198180	There are villages that are 500 kilometers from the nearest health facility with no roads
198180	199480	anywhere.
199480	203660	So even if a remedy is available, what if it means going on an odyssey to get it to
203660	205620	the patients?
205620	208520	This called for an attack using brute force.
208520	213140	To stamp out NTDs once and for all, what's possibly the biggest medical program in human
213140	217220	history was launched unmatched in scale.
217220	221580	Organizations from all fields are working together right now to eliminate 10 of these
221580	223780	NTDs forever.
223780	228500	Ironically, every NTD is in fact preventable or treatable.
228500	232900	But most of them can only be controlled by giving medicine to every person in all high
232900	234620	risk areas.
234620	239820	That means millions and millions of doses of medicine, often for several NTDs at a time
239820	244700	over the course of years in countries where there is no infrastructure.
244700	248940	Governments and health organizations just couldn't do that by themselves.
249340	253780	Here, humanity got an opportunity to show off what the industrialized production of
253780	255820	medicine can achieve.
255820	260200	The pharma industry stepped in to distribute the necessary drugs for free and promised
260200	264080	to keep doing it until those 10 diseases are gone.
264080	269980	By 2020, nearly $18 billion worth of drugs will have been distributed, the largest drug
269980	273060	donation the world has ever seen.
273060	277900	They also helped make sure the drugs actually get to where they're needed.
277900	283560	In 2015 alone, these treatments reached over 815 million people, more than the population
283560	287300	of the EU and the US combined.
287300	289780	Bad things happening generates headlines.
289780	294620	Hundreds of millions of people overcoming extremely destructive diseases in an unprecedented
294620	297300	act of cooperation doesn't.
297300	300340	Stories like this one are not told often enough.
300340	302420	Good things happen all the time.
302420	306220	Moving humanity closer to a future with no suffering.
306220	311660	So if you or one of your friends are in need of uplifting news, share this video with them.
311660	316700	We as a species really can do great things with no other motivation than to help each
316700	317700	other.
317700	322340	It's good to remember that from time to time.
