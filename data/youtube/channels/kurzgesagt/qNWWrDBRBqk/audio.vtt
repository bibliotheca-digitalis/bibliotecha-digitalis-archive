00:00.000 --> 00:07.600
In the year 1014, Byzantine Emperor Basil II defeated the Bulgarian army and captured

00:07.600 --> 00:09.600
15,000 prisoners.

00:09.600 --> 00:13.200
He could have killed them, but he had a different idea.

00:13.200 --> 00:17.040
He wanted to weaken his opponents for decades to come.

00:17.040 --> 00:24.020
So he ordered that 99 out of every 100 prisoners be blinded, the 100th to be spared one eye

00:24.020 --> 00:28.860
to guide the rest back home, forcing their communities to care for them for the rest

00:28.860 --> 00:30.580
of their lives.

00:30.580 --> 00:36.220
Today, humans are subject to an attack just as cynical as this by a league of supervillains

00:36.220 --> 00:39.780
called NTDs.

00:39.780 --> 00:44.900
One in seven humans on the planet suffers from one or more NTDs, more than the entire

00:44.900 --> 00:47.900
population of Europe.

00:47.900 --> 00:50.180
They do unimaginable damage.

00:50.180 --> 00:54.940
By crippling countless people, they destroy billions of dollars in income each year, weaken

00:54.940 --> 00:57.940
communities and slow progress.

00:58.020 --> 01:03.020
What are these monsters straight out of a horror movie, seeking to wreak havoc on our species?

01:13.020 --> 01:18.260
NTDs are caused by a vast range of different parasites such as worms, amoeba, bacteria

01:18.260 --> 01:19.980
or viruses.

01:19.980 --> 01:24.860
The symptoms they cause are just as diverse and truly the stuff of nightmares.

01:24.980 --> 01:30.340
Some, like hookworms, compete with children's brains and bodies for nutrition, stunting

01:30.340 --> 01:33.380
growth and impairing intelligence.

01:33.380 --> 01:37.840
Some NTDs cause blindness as a result of awful eye infections.

01:37.840 --> 01:43.260
Other parasites confine patients to bed for months and damage internal organs, often shortening

01:43.260 --> 01:45.540
lifespans drastically.

01:45.540 --> 01:50.460
Yet others cause horrible disfigurements that lead to social stigma, a life lived in shame

01:50.460 --> 01:52.340
and unemployment.

01:52.340 --> 01:55.140
There are also a few that are incredibly agonizing.

01:55.140 --> 01:59.060
They cause continuous itching or horrible pain.

01:59.060 --> 02:03.760
In fact, let's introduce you to one of them, dracunculiasis.

02:03.760 --> 02:08.780
If you accidentally drink water infected by it, you won't notice anything for a year,

02:08.780 --> 02:13.060
until one day you suddenly see a blister on your leg.

02:13.060 --> 02:16.700
The world breaks out of the skin to release new larvae.

02:16.700 --> 02:22.340
The only way to remove it is to slowly put it out of your leg, center by centimeter,

02:22.340 --> 02:27.880
over the course of several weeks, because dracunculiasis is now up to a meter long.

02:27.880 --> 02:31.220
We can all agree that we should kill such parasites with fire.

02:31.220 --> 02:36.460
That's why we declared war on them, pleading to eradicate most of them by 2020, and we

02:36.460 --> 02:38.940
tried doing that very hard.

02:38.940 --> 02:44.780
In 1985, there were 3.5 million cases of dracunculiasis all over the world.

02:44.780 --> 02:47.900
In 2015, there were 22.

02:47.900 --> 02:52.980
We killed 99.999% of these little monsters.

02:52.980 --> 02:57.420
It will be the first parasite we eradicate for good very soon.

02:57.420 --> 03:02.540
So even if they don't generate big headlines like Ebola did, actually, amazing things have

03:02.540 --> 03:05.500
happened when it comes to NTDs.

03:05.500 --> 03:07.860
All NTDs have one thing in common.

03:07.860 --> 03:11.860
They preferably attack humans who live in the most isolated communities and who are

03:11.860 --> 03:14.140
least able to defend themselves.

03:14.140 --> 03:18.180
There are villages that are 500 kilometers from the nearest health facility with no roads

03:18.180 --> 03:19.480
anywhere.

03:19.480 --> 03:23.660
So even if a remedy is available, what if it means going on an odyssey to get it to

03:23.660 --> 03:25.620
the patients?

03:25.620 --> 03:28.520
This called for an attack using brute force.

03:28.520 --> 03:33.140
To stamp out NTDs once and for all, what's possibly the biggest medical program in human

03:33.140 --> 03:37.220
history was launched unmatched in scale.

03:37.220 --> 03:41.580
Organizations from all fields are working together right now to eliminate 10 of these

03:41.580 --> 03:43.780
NTDs forever.

03:43.780 --> 03:48.500
Ironically, every NTD is in fact preventable or treatable.

03:48.500 --> 03:52.900
But most of them can only be controlled by giving medicine to every person in all high

03:52.900 --> 03:54.620
risk areas.

03:54.620 --> 03:59.820
That means millions and millions of doses of medicine, often for several NTDs at a time

03:59.820 --> 04:04.700
over the course of years in countries where there is no infrastructure.

04:04.700 --> 04:08.940
Governments and health organizations just couldn't do that by themselves.

04:09.340 --> 04:13.780
Here, humanity got an opportunity to show off what the industrialized production of

04:13.780 --> 04:15.820
medicine can achieve.

04:15.820 --> 04:20.200
The pharma industry stepped in to distribute the necessary drugs for free and promised

04:20.200 --> 04:24.080
to keep doing it until those 10 diseases are gone.

04:24.080 --> 04:29.980
By 2020, nearly $18 billion worth of drugs will have been distributed, the largest drug

04:29.980 --> 04:33.060
donation the world has ever seen.

04:33.060 --> 04:37.900
They also helped make sure the drugs actually get to where they're needed.

04:37.900 --> 04:43.560
In 2015 alone, these treatments reached over 815 million people, more than the population

04:43.560 --> 04:47.300
of the EU and the US combined.

04:47.300 --> 04:49.780
Bad things happening generates headlines.

04:49.780 --> 04:54.620
Hundreds of millions of people overcoming extremely destructive diseases in an unprecedented

04:54.620 --> 04:57.300
act of cooperation doesn't.

04:57.300 --> 05:00.340
Stories like this one are not told often enough.

05:00.340 --> 05:02.420
Good things happen all the time.

05:02.420 --> 05:06.220
Moving humanity closer to a future with no suffering.

05:06.220 --> 05:11.660
So if you or one of your friends are in need of uplifting news, share this video with them.

05:11.660 --> 05:16.700
We as a species really can do great things with no other motivation than to help each

05:16.700 --> 05:17.700
other.

05:17.700 --> 05:22.340
It's good to remember that from time to time.

05:22.340 --> 05:26.540
This video was made possible in part by a grant from the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation

05:26.540 --> 05:29.180
and your support on patreon.com.

If you're disappointed by the lack of disturbing facts in this video, here's a playlist about

05:38.400 --> 05:39.880
the end of everything.
